1
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,209
Maria!

2
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:07,681
Ben!

3
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,479
Ben!

4
00:06:06,026 --> 00:06:08,295
Let's go!
After anothers.

5
00:10:23,188 --> 00:10:25,924
They burned the farm.

6
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:27,526
There's nothing left.

7
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,705
We gonna spend the night here.

8
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,679
We'll leave tomorrow.

9
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,448
Hold it.

10
00:11:01,057 --> 00:11:02,658
They wounded Ben.

11
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:07,969
Nothing we could do to help him.

12
00:11:10,075 --> 00:11:12,777
Do not blame us for his death.

13
00:11:17,048 --> 00:11:18,916
This is your money.

14
00:13:20,706 --> 00:13:22,074
What are you doing here?

15
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:25,177
Ben is dead.

16
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:26,947
Why?

17
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,710
Ben robbed transport with payment money

18
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:35,450
With Thomas and Will they killed everyone
who was transporting money.

19
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,294
Last time I saw you
I said it's going to end badly.

20
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,923
They didn't want to leave this place.

21
00:13:43,488 --> 00:13:44,497
And the others?

22
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:47,937
Thomas and Will escaped.
They're hiding at my place.

23
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:52,908
Tell them to go across the border.
Otherwise they're dead.

24
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:55,912
And you too...

25
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,080
Ben was your friend.

26
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,685
It was long time ago.

27
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:04,510
Help me.

28
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,050
Ask your brothers.

29
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,425
You're the only one who
can get revange on Rogers.

30
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,055
I don't even know him.

31
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,457
That's why.

32
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,656
I'm not interested.

33
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,562
If you can't do it for him
do it for me.

34
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:25,701
Not for him, nor for you.
Don't want to get involved.

35
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,279
Then do it for this.

36
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,474
It's Ben's share.

37
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,283
What do you want me to do?

38
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,683
Whatever you want.

39
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:39,917
And if I'll refuse?

40
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,820
I'll do it myself.
That's all what I have left.

41
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,228
They will kill you.

42
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:48,791
I don't care!

43
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:53,664
I'll see you in 2 days.

44
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,395
Want a room?
Yes.

45
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,336
Sign the book.

46
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:28,415
A dollar for the room and 5 cents more
if you want to take a shower.

47
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,113
Bastard!

48
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:32,113
You promised me!

49
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,516
Get lost!

50
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,655
You have to pay up front.

51
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,500
Give me back my money!

52
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,864
Get out! Bitch!

53
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:56,071
Bastard!
I'll make you pay for it.

54
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,873
Come on, I take it
to your room

55
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,927
Now go. I do not want problems
with Rogers.

56
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,632
Buy me a drink?

57
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,869
You're new in town.
I saw you at the hotel.

58
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:01,395
Where is he?

59
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:05,635
There. In the corner.
Playing cards, with the girl.

60
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,910
I know him.

61
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,980
Be careful.
Half of  family is here.

62
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,614
Get out from here.

63
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:30,932
Stone.
Yes?

64
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,195
Well, my friend...

65
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,935
You think you can do whatever you want
because you're The Rogers.

66
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:53,574
Let me tell you one thing,
I'm not afraid of The Rogers.

67
00:22:55,273 --> 00:23:01,121
Too bad he is not here.
But we'll get him.

68
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,621
It's good that you're Rogers.

69
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,031
You hanged Ben...

70
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:14,264
...but soon all your Family
is going to swing on the rope.

71
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:17,833
You're the main thug here.
Everybody knows it.

72
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:22,138
But everybody is afraid...

73
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:26,480
...that your Father's thugs
gonna burn their farms.

74
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:31,547
Take their cattle or simply kill them.

75
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:36,849
And the sheriff is on your payroll.

76
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,422
But, now...

77
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:42,687
... it will be over

78
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:45,426
You gonna face us.

79
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:47,396
We're The Vallees.

80
00:23:48,993 --> 00:23:53,306
I'm warning you. I'm gourmet.
So you gonna have to share.

81
00:23:55,167 --> 00:24:00,412
Now it's time for a small show
so you'd know who we are.

82
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:04,082
Don't do it Vallee. Don't do it.
If I were you...

83
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,246
But you're not me.

84
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:08,051
Stone.

85
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,955
Can you tell me who is he?

86
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:15,752
I have no idea and I lost my glasses.

87
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:33,899
Open the door!

88
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,914
Open or we'll break down the door!

89
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:50,983
You're arrested for the murder.

90
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,351
Let's go.

91
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,428
Give him to us, Sheriff.

92
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,934
I can't do it.
Four people were killed.

93
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:55,978
It was self-defense. We both
were there. We can be witnesses.

94
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,971
Then you know who he is.

95
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,242
Sure, he works for us.

96
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,086
Let him go.
My brothers and I will take care of it.

97
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,383
You better start looking for Caines.

98
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,756
My men are looking for them.

99
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:12,389
Release him.
You are being paid well.

100
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:15,522
If you're looking for troubles
we'll find them for you.

101
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,633
Well... What are you waiting for?

102
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:50,832
Wake up. You are free to go.

103
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,706
Working for Rogers for a long time?

104
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:04,903
OK.

105
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,674
I see.

106
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:11,611
Next time you will not have so much luck.
Self-defence or not...

107
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:40,810
Let's go.

108
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,649
Thank you, Sheriff.

109
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,812
Don't forget the Caines.

110
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:00,719
Come here.

111
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:10,464
My kids told me about you
and I am grateful.

112
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:13,241
Are you looking for a job?

113
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:15,500
It depends.
Of what?

114
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:16,776
Job.

115
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,846
You're new here, right?

116
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:24,643
Right.

117
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:30,149
He is not very talkative.
Doesn't like questions.

118
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:31,755
What's your name?

119
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,054
Manuel.

120
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:40,034
I have a good job as a foreman.
15 a week, with food and lodging. Sounds good?

121
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:43,594
OK

122
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,841
Bud, he stays with you and George.

123
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:55,717
Johanna, this is Manuel.
He will be the new foreman.

124
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:56,850
Let's go.

125
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,953
I talked to Sheriff.

126
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:01,984
And...?

127
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,012
What she's doing?

128
00:33:58,102 --> 00:33:59,479
I do not know.

129
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:03,780
We can not stay here.
It's dangerous.

130
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,918
They'll find us.

131
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:12,352
I go talk to her.

132
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,094
What did you decided?

133
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:24,996
I'll stay here.

134
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,975
We are going across the border tonight.

135
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,481
You can do whatever you want,
but in your place I would stay a day or two.

136
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,318
You are safe here.

137
00:34:42,015 --> 00:34:44,000
I may need you.

138
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,653
Tom, look...

139
00:34:53,015 --> 00:34:55,653
Get horses!

140
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:34,461
We are grateful for the blessings
we are about to receive, Lord. Amen

141
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,788
Looking for something?

142
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,687
Is it forbidden to walk?

143
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:31,026
No. The boss just doesn't like anyone
to come close to the horses after dark.

144
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,099
What's your name?

145
00:41:36,593 --> 00:41:37,399
Corey, sir.

146
00:41:38,895 --> 00:41:41,236
You are the new foreman?
That's right.

147
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:44,546
I'm just following orders.

148
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,911
Okay. Good night.

149
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:50,380
Good night.

150
00:46:05,683 --> 00:46:06,660
Upstairs.

151
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:22,648
What are you doing here?

152
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:55,747
Frank!

153
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:59,812
Do you want money?

154
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:03,353
No. Ben's share was enough.

155
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:07,991
Was enough for what?

156
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:11,258
To kidnap you daughter.
I paid the man to do that.

157
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:14,227
With your money, Rogers.

158
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:18,570
And now if you want to see
your daughter alive again...

159
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:21,139
...you will do exactly what I say.

160
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:36,113
Is that clear?

161
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:44,958
Three of my men did not return.
They were after the Caines.

162
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:49,265
They were going to your place.
What happened to them?

163
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:56,666
Leave her alone, Sheriff.
You can leave, Mrs. Caine.

164
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:58,507
I don't understand you, Rogers.

165
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:19,055
What did she wanted?

166
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:22,596
Dad. What are we going to do?

167
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,512
What happened?
Did it work?

168
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:08,845
What do you want to know?

169
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:12,046
What they decided.
Would they pay?

170
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:15,546
Yes. They'll pay a lot!

171
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:16,521
How much?

172
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:17,990
You need to leave tonight.

173
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:20,952
Before they come after him.

174
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:22,389
After who?

175
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:24,289
After Ben.

176
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:26,693
Ben? He's dead and buried!

177
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,865
You can't do much for him.

178
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:31,734
They're going to bury him at cemetary.

179
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:35,802
Whole Rogers family is going to
carry him to cemetary.

180
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:38,379
They'll provide whole ritual.

181
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:42,979
After they admit their crime
they'll get the girl back.

182
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,915
I don't need any money.

183
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:50,823
You are out of your mind.

184
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:52,887
You have no rights...

185
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:56,926
You should have told us before.

186
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,795
I would never do that.
Stop, Tom.

187
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:00,962
No! We do our way.

188
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:07,008
That's the last thing we can do for Ben.
Let's go. There's nothing for us here.

189
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:48,839
Men are like grass
and all the grass will die.

190
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:53,642
Look for us with mercy.
Give life to your children.

191
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:58,949
Despite the hate. The earth will swallow them
and the fire wiil consume them.

192
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:02,546
The enemy fells before the arms of Lord.

193
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:07,957
"Vanity, vanity," said Eclezias.
All is vanity.

194
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:11,658
My body screams for us all.

195
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,730
My heart is completely open.
Listen and give me comfort.

196
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:20,707
Save me and let my soul
find eternal rest.

197
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:24,141
It is written that everything has its time.

198
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,506
Time to be born
and time to die.

199
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:31,117
So be it.

200
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:36,514
"Vanity, vanity," said Eclezias.
All is vanity.

201
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:55,052
Maria sent us to take the girl
back to Rogers.

202
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:57,656
All is cleared up.
Maria and Rogers found agreement.

203
01:01:00,024 --> 01:01:02,096
They agreed to exchange
the girl for the money.

204
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:37,621
You thought it over?

205
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:41,032
$2000.00 and the weapon.

206
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:41,727
Scum.

207
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:43,303
Your brother will die if you do not speak.

208
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:45,804
You touch my brother...
you'll never see the girl.

209
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:47,203
How do we know she's still alive?

210
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:51,802
Otherwise I'd never come here.
I'm not an idiot!

211
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:53,312
Talk, or...

212
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:56,576
If I'm not go back tonight he will kill her.

213
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:58,015
I'll make you talk!

214
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,415
That's enough!

215
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:36,018
Here're the money.

216
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:38,586
Bring her back.

217
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:40,952
Finally you come to senses.

218
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:42,461
Frank!

219
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:47,367
It is best to treat me nice, boy.

220
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,638
Money up front.

221
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:53,908
Complete trust.

222
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:57,736
I'm going Eli.

223
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:05,648
Good. I'll bring her to town.

224
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:08,017
No! You'll bring her here!

225
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:10,224
Your brother stays with us.

226
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:14,921
If she's not here by 11 o'clock,
you know what to expect.

227
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:16,328
Thomas!
Calm down, Eli.

228
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:20,492
We have the money and the girl.
Everything will work out.

229
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:21,500
So?

230
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:25,372
A deal.
Eli stays with you.

231
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:28,468
I do not want to meet you
at the ranch.

232
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:33,974
Not that I do not trust you.
Let's meet in town, it's closer to the border.

233
01:04:37,831 --> 01:04:39,974
Okay. We will meet
at 11 o'clock at the church.

234
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:41,386
I'll be there.

235
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:50,019
Thomas!

236
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:53,899
I told you, Eli. Don't to worry.
I'll not leave you here.

237
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:56,000
Don't forget.

238
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:58,100
At 11 o'clock.

239
01:08:53,362 --> 01:08:58,038
I placed my people. I stay here.
Go!

240
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,406
What are you going to do now?

241
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:33,036
I don't know.
"Now" has no meaning anymore.

242
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:42,013
You can't stay here.
The Rogers never forgive those who took their money.

243
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:48,417
You know what happened to me?

244
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:53,424
I'm tired, Manuel.
I am not afraid of anything.

245
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,165
I stopped having feelings.

246
01:09:57,626 --> 01:09:59,299
There's nothing else.

247
01:10:01,163 --> 01:10:02,540
Go home now.

248
01:10:03,098 --> 01:10:05,100
I'll pick up tomorrow morning.

249
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:10,379
I'll take you north.
If you only want.

250
01:10:29,925 --> 01:10:34,203
We do not need you.
Manuel will take you home.

251
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:39,376
I hope they'll kill you!

252
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:50,635
Tell us.
Who did this?

253
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:55,982
Better say or you'll end up
like your brother.

254
01:12:56,905 --> 01:12:59,784
I don't know...
It's him...

255
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,013
Who?

256
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:03,785
Manuel.

257
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:06,115
Where did he take Johanna?

258
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:07,455
"The Ghost Town".

259
01:13:08,584 --> 01:13:12,430
It's not him.
It's all Maria.

260
01:14:04,406 --> 01:14:05,350
Let's go.

261
01:19:24,663 --> 01:19:26,067
Maria!

262
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:29,067
Manuel.

263
01:19:30,799 --> 01:19:32,142
My love.

264
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:35,479
You brought her back?
Yes.

265
01:19:37,506 --> 01:19:39,110
They didn't believe it.

266
01:19:40,876 --> 01:19:42,787
They thought she's dead.

267
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:48,961
Eli told them where
you're hiding.

268
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:50,959
They will find it.

269
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:54,326
Do not go back to "The Ghost Town".

270
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:55,799
Do not worry.

271
01:19:56,424 --> 01:19:57,926
They wait for you over there.

272
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:04,768
I've heard them saying that.

273
01:20:05,866 --> 01:20:07,142
They wait for nothing.

274
01:20:07,702 --> 01:20:08,976
We are leaving now.

275
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:12,813
We go to a place I know up north. 
Do not worry.

276
01:20:14,378 --> 01:20:15,016
Manuel...

277
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:18,016
I wanted to tell you...

278
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:24,060
Come closer...
Leave me here...

279
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:28,063
I'm cold...

280
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:33,898
Leave this place...

281
01:20:35,864 --> 01:20:37,741
I don't want you to get killed...

282
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:40,368
.

283
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:44,910
You know...
When we left...

284
01:20:45,974 --> 01:20:47,510
First time...

285
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:52,687
I got scared I will not
see you anymore...

286
01:20:54,049 --> 01:20:57,223
Never again...
