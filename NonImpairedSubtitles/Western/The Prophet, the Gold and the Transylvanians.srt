1
00:00:22,968 --> 00:00:26,005
THE PROPHET, THE GOLD
AND THE TRANSYLVANIANS

2
00:09:40,656 --> 00:09:44,136
Romulus, I hope that you're
understanding what you're reading.

3
00:09:54,215 --> 00:09:55,551
[ spelling ]

4
00:09:55,671 --> 00:09:59,265
It's ok, continue,
but you can do it a lot better.

5
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:01,480
[unintelligible]

6
00:10:04,577 --> 00:10:05,388
I have it. ( the letter ) 

7
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:09,473
Be careful to look for the station,
I don't know it's name.

8
00:10:09,593 --> 00:10:10,893
Ion is waiting for us there.

9
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:13,017
But you have his letter, right?

10
00:10:13,137 --> 00:10:14,381
I have it.

11
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:17,946
Ok, ok. Continue to read.

12
00:10:23,697 --> 00:10:25,116
How do you do?

13
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:41,776
Listen to them,
are they talking about us?

14
00:11:23,297 --> 00:11:26,505
I think that the mister wants to know who we are.
Answer him.

15
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,525
Yes Mister! Romania!
Village Poplaca!

16
00:12:10,221 --> 00:12:10,737
Hey!

17
00:12:11,336 --> 00:12:13,714
I haven't crossed the ocean for you to
start smoking!

18
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:15,225
Thank you.

19
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:28,943
What is he saying?

20
00:12:29,063 --> 00:12:29,994
I don't know.

21
00:12:30,114 --> 00:12:31,782
Then, why are you still reading
that "Bible"?

22
00:13:01,032 --> 00:13:01,843
Romi...

23
00:13:01,963 --> 00:13:05,013
I've drunk a lot in my day,
but I've never drunk whisky.

24
00:13:07,344 --> 00:13:08,579
Weak, only about 30% proof.

25
00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:11,510
Try this.

26
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,663
This is what we call "tzuica".

27
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:40,636
Hey Romi.

28
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:45,060
Play something on your whistle.

29
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,184
It's not allowed here.

30
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,534
When you get two slaps from me,
you'll see what's allowed and what's not.

31
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:17,560
Be calm, it's their business.
We have our own affairs.

32
00:17:42,043 --> 00:17:43,075
Hey!

33
00:17:43,474 --> 00:17:45,722
-This is our station.
-And why did you not tell me?

34
00:17:45,842 --> 00:17:47,816
Then, let's go.

35
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,875
Please forgive us.

36
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:02,322
Tell them something in English. If not,
they may believe that we are uncivilised.

37
00:18:02,746 --> 00:18:03,723
Please forgive us.

38
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:16,504
Follow me!

39
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,311
We stay here,

40
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:25,352
until they solve their
problems.

41
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:31,779
Hey, I think this is Ion.

42
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:33,954
Look at him, he was
photographed.

43
00:18:34,691 --> 00:18:37,180
I think he is a very important person.

44
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,894
Probably a politician.

45
00:18:59,145 --> 00:19:00,048
Hey shepherd!

46
00:19:00,168 --> 00:19:01,578
You said that we mustn't
enter in the conflict.

47
00:19:01,698 --> 00:19:02,813
Yeah ,yeah.

48
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,214
Give me my bag!

49
00:19:10,922 --> 00:19:11,825
At least...

50
00:19:11,945 --> 00:19:13,078
load it first.

51
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:30,272
You must shut up, "Mucho".

52
00:19:34,534 --> 00:19:37,336
If we get in trouble,
who's responsible? "Mucho" is responsible.

53
00:19:54,938 --> 00:19:56,450
What is this? A Circus?

54
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,924
Fall out!

55
00:19:58,385 --> 00:19:59,252
March!

56
00:20:13,405 --> 00:20:14,584
I got it at Plevna.

57
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:15,672
From the Turks.

58
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:17,568
Spoils of war

59
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,666
Hey Iooooooooooon!!!

60
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,081
What is he saying?

61
00:20:36,677 --> 00:20:38,501
I don't know,
he doesn't speak like in the dictionary.

62
00:20:38,621 --> 00:20:40,068
Shut up with your
dictionary.

63
00:20:40,658 --> 00:20:42,483
Money thrown out the window,
you're stupid.

64
00:20:43,591 --> 00:20:45,250
Say something,
maybe he'll understand you.

65
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:49,858
Hey Iooon!

66
00:21:07,163 --> 00:21:07,918
Friend.

67
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:10,186
Friend.

68
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:17,120
What is he saying?

69
00:25:52,503 --> 00:25:54,384
Do you want a slap?

70
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:57,536
And don't stare at these bitches,
they're not for you.

71
00:25:58,126 --> 00:25:59,361
All they want is money.

72
00:26:01,542 --> 00:26:03,072
Is Ion here?

73
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,080
- What is he saying?
- He said to play cards.

74
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,532
Tell him that we don't have any money.

75
00:26:29,846 --> 00:26:30,731
Thanks.

76
00:26:33,606 --> 00:26:37,680
Mister, if you think that you can beat
me, then you're crazy.

77
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:53,720
Take the money.

78
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:55,195
Romi...

79
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,278
You must know that this is
a beautiful game.

80
00:28:04,987 --> 00:28:07,863
And when you think that I've
never played before.

81
00:28:39,772 --> 00:28:40,712
What is he saying?

82
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:46,100
But him?

83
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:47,242
I don't know.

84
00:28:47,795 --> 00:28:49,381
I've already told you that he doesn't
speak like in the dictionary.

85
00:28:49,731 --> 00:28:51,464
Mister, listen to me.

86
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,699
When you have a seven...

87
00:28:52,819 --> 00:28:54,791
you're in.

88
00:29:41,638 --> 00:29:42,542
What is he saying?

89
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,081
It looks like you've won him.

90
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:50,668
Bless me Lord.

91
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:53,451
How can you win a man by
playing cards? He's not a cow.

92
00:29:54,347 --> 00:29:56,283
No way, NO WAY!

93
00:30:18,091 --> 00:30:20,654
But, if that's the tradition around
these parts...

94
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:27,596
I'll buy drinks for
everyone.

95
00:30:27,716 --> 00:30:28,849
Tzuica.

96
00:30:30,544 --> 00:30:31,355
What's your name?

97
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,760
Well Bob...

98
00:30:39,516 --> 00:30:41,046
Take a shot from here.

99
00:30:44,639 --> 00:30:45,892
Let's drink and get 
to know each other.

100
00:30:46,408 --> 00:30:48,067
I'm called Traian Brad.

101
00:30:54,816 --> 00:30:56,512
This is whisky.

102
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:05,166
God's garden must be huge.
Who is this man?

103
00:33:05,995 --> 00:33:06,696
What is he saying?

104
00:34:13,453 --> 00:34:15,241
Well mister...

105
00:34:15,361 --> 00:34:18,946
We, I mean me and this boy,
who is my little brother...

106
00:34:19,278 --> 00:34:20,936
we've come here from
Poplaca.

107
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,473
We crossed "The Big Water",
the ocean.

108
00:34:23,593 --> 00:34:26,708
I'll never forget it.

109
00:34:26,828 --> 00:34:28,591
Everything I ate,
was puked back up.

110
00:34:30,121 --> 00:34:32,517
We're here in America for
our brother, Ion.

111
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:35,503
To earn some money,
our country is poor.

112
00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:39,572
We even have the letters from him.
Take out the letter, don't stare at me.

113
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:44,254
And I think you know him.

114
00:34:44,843 --> 00:34:46,687
Everybody knows him,
look.

115
00:34:46,807 --> 00:34:47,668
This is Ion.

116
00:34:59,237 --> 00:35:01,596
Aaaaaa, I get it.
He says that we're under arrest.

117
00:35:10,522 --> 00:35:13,047
How can I say in their language:
F.... you?

118
00:35:13,351 --> 00:35:15,010
I don't know, it isn't written in
the dictionary.

119
00:35:17,259 --> 00:35:18,697
Romi, we're in trouble.

120
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,033
And this happened...

121
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,033


122
00:35:22,346 --> 00:35:26,199
because I entered in the conflict
at the station.

123
00:35:26,881 --> 00:35:28,466
Maybe I hurt someone.

124
00:35:30,023 --> 00:35:31,608
And I've told you not
to get involved!

125
00:35:31,924 --> 00:35:35,703
And I've also told you on the road!

126
00:35:36,938 --> 00:35:38,394
And you with the dictionary!

127
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:43,217
And, if the father from Poplaca  finds out?
I will be ashamed to meet him.

128
00:35:45,624 --> 00:35:47,339
And your "smart" brother ( Ion )...

129
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:50,177
Ehhhhh now...
If I catch him, I'll break his bones.

130
00:35:50,297 --> 00:35:51,449
Don't call me on my name,
if I won't do this.

131
00:35:54,837 --> 00:35:56,422
And you,
what are you talking about?

132
00:35:58,303 --> 00:35:59,390
It was better at home.

133
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,012
Yeah sure.

134
00:36:01,132 --> 00:36:02,858
- You're very "smart".
- Yes?

135
00:36:02,978 --> 00:36:05,033
Take out your whistle
and play something.

136
00:36:06,047 --> 00:36:07,097
Maybe our homesickness
will pass.

137
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,531
Ehhhh, now,
I don't really want this.

138
00:36:09,651 --> 00:36:11,974
Maybe you want something
from me.

139
00:36:13,826 --> 00:36:14,877
Yeah yeah.

140
00:36:16,572 --> 00:36:17,697
Please Romica.

141
00:37:02,056 --> 00:37:04,047
- What does he want?
- How should I know?

142
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,469
I think Ion has changed,
since he left Poplaca.

143
00:37:39,446 --> 00:37:41,400
But into something that's normal,
around this parts.

144
00:38:22,461 --> 00:38:23,143
Learn.

145
00:38:23,263 --> 00:38:24,341
To work.

146
00:38:24,968 --> 00:38:26,093
Be back.

147
00:38:28,428 --> 00:38:29,405
Home!

148
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:32,962
To live like normal people.

149
00:38:36,045 --> 00:38:37,243
What do you want
from us?

150
00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:39,086
It's because we won
at poker?

151
00:38:39,713 --> 00:38:42,662
Take your money back,
and fuck you!

152
00:42:01,627 --> 00:42:03,010
Brother, what do they
want from us?

153
00:46:21,443 --> 00:46:22,181
Hey man...

154
00:46:22,301 --> 00:46:23,416
Sit next to me.

155
00:47:49,443 --> 00:47:50,033
Hey...

156
00:47:50,365 --> 00:47:51,895
Maybe he's a Turkish
priest.

157
00:49:27,568 --> 00:49:28,342
Hey Romi...

158
00:49:29,172 --> 00:49:31,808
As I see it, hard work
is waiting for us.

159
00:49:39,572 --> 00:49:40,678
What does he want?

160
00:49:40,991 --> 00:49:43,848
How should I know?
Don't keep asking me this!

161
00:49:44,127 --> 00:49:46,689
Every day you're asking:
"What is he saying?".

162
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,717
Hey, listen here.

163
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:51,758
I think that I'll hurt
this woman if she keeps talking.

164
00:52:14,974 --> 00:52:15,693
Romi!

165
00:52:15,988 --> 00:52:17,942
Tell this man that if he
touches me...

166
00:52:18,062 --> 00:52:21,776
is a dead man, even that
I'll remain here for life.

167
00:57:38,102 --> 00:57:39,411
Where are we going now?

168
00:57:40,314 --> 00:57:43,577
I don't know, people
are like shit around here.

169
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,526
Youre a bad man.

170
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:48,111
And a motherfucker.

171
00:57:48,871 --> 00:57:50,014
I wont forget you.

172
00:59:12,839 --> 00:59:15,253
Man, with this salute
you've touched my heart.

173
01:00:07,764 --> 01:00:08,557
Hey!

174
01:00:10,123 --> 01:00:13,017
Hey, have you caught
something?

175
01:00:14,971 --> 01:00:16,041
Not too good.

176
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,907
Hey, look what
I've found.

177
01:00:21,327 --> 01:00:22,303
Good job.

178
01:00:22,727 --> 01:00:24,294
You've started to
collect pebbles.

179
01:00:24,414 --> 01:00:26,635
Maybe in the future you'll play
with...

180
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:28,409
God forbid.

181
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,432
He says that is gold.

182
01:00:32,117 --> 01:00:35,029
Gold? Ha ha.
Everyone will laugh at you.

183
01:00:36,596 --> 01:00:38,310
Do you hear smart boy?
Pepitas.

184
01:00:36,596 --> 01:00:38,310


185
01:00:38,623 --> 01:00:40,246
Toys, dolls.

186
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:41,757
Let's go home.

187
01:00:42,121 --> 01:00:43,467
I shot a deer.

188
01:01:18,531 --> 01:01:19,139
Ion!

189
01:01:20,583 --> 01:01:22,206
You're finally here.

190
01:01:22,482 --> 01:01:25,063
- Well well, you even have a flag.
- Of course.

191
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:29,634
Come inside.

192
01:01:37,215 --> 01:01:37,750
Hey Romi,

193
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:38,469
wake up!

194
01:01:38,589 --> 01:01:39,427
Look who's here.

195
01:01:42,601 --> 01:01:43,633
What are you doing?

196
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,953
Oh, I see that you have
a very nice household.

197
01:01:56,054 --> 01:01:56,884
What was I suposed to
do?

198
01:01:57,529 --> 01:01:59,280
Wait for you?

199
01:02:00,386 --> 01:02:01,805
Are you hungry?

200
01:02:06,426 --> 01:02:09,025
Since you left Poplaca,
you think you're royalty.

201
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,643
You have "tzuica"?

202
01:02:12,697 --> 01:02:15,444
I've tried some berries from here,
but we don't have a boiler.

203
01:02:16,439 --> 01:02:17,656
How did you find
this man?

204
01:02:18,209 --> 01:02:18,706
Bob?

205
01:02:19,149 --> 01:02:20,107
I won him at poker.

206
01:02:20,955 --> 01:02:21,895
- Ion.
- ?

207
01:02:22,223 --> 01:02:24,251
What have you been doing
around these parts?

208
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,131
It's a long story.

209
01:02:27,901 --> 01:02:29,394
And it's "her" time.

210
01:02:29,514 --> 01:02:30,776
I don't even know how
to begin.

211
01:02:31,292 --> 01:02:33,799
7 years ago, I came to
in America, I've done a lot of things.

212
01:02:34,299 --> 01:02:36,271
I was a farmer, a porter, a hunter...

213
01:02:36,391 --> 01:02:37,986
a salesman, a cowboy.

214
01:02:39,092 --> 01:02:40,087
It was very hard.

215
01:02:41,325 --> 01:02:44,716
3 years ago, I was in Texas, and
I heard that here...

216
01:02:45,288 --> 01:02:46,265
gold could be found.

217
01:02:47,334 --> 01:02:48,532
Others came too.

218
01:02:49,306 --> 01:02:52,477
And yes, we found gold,
and we shared the land.

219
01:02:53,216 --> 01:02:55,889
We worked hard,
and the things were good.

220
01:02:56,534 --> 01:02:58,654
In a couple of years we were rich.

221
01:02:59,483 --> 01:03:01,640
But a man caught us.

222
01:03:02,266 --> 01:03:03,188
I know him.

223
01:03:04,367 --> 01:03:05,787
He didn't catch me.

224
01:03:06,373 --> 01:03:08,585
Everything is in his grip
around here.

225
01:03:09,083 --> 01:03:10,189
Marshall is his son.

226
01:03:11,092 --> 01:03:13,857
- A marshal.
- He's the sheriff.

227
01:03:14,419 --> 01:03:16,096
He took everything.

228
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:21,066
He took the gold, telling us that we had exploited
his land. Those who stood up to him were "cleansed".

229
01:03:21,859 --> 01:03:23,389
How about "lei" ( romanian moneys )?
Can they be found here?

230
01:03:23,509 --> 01:03:26,191
No, only dollars.

231
01:03:26,721 --> 01:03:28,528
But the only law here, Traian,
....

232
01:03:29,735 --> 01:03:30,417
is the gun.

233
01:03:32,069 --> 01:03:34,004
The miners were scared,
and they were subjugated.

234
01:03:34,889 --> 01:03:37,488
I refused to bow down,
and they were on me.

235
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,200
They hired a killer to 
"cleanse" me.

236
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,302
And I think that
you've "cleansed" him.

237
01:03:42,774 --> 01:03:44,709
And the defenders of the law,
are looking for you everywhere.

238
01:03:45,668 --> 01:03:46,589
And I....

239
01:03:47,511 --> 01:03:51,271
When I saw your picture,
I thought that you were "a big man".

240
01:03:52,048 --> 01:03:53,725
I was also in jail
for you.

241
01:03:57,246 --> 01:03:59,145
And this....
is your wife?

242
01:04:00,373 --> 01:04:01,792
She's too young for you.

243
01:04:02,126 --> 01:04:03,841
.... wants to be his wife.

244
01:04:04,136 --> 01:04:07,417
How? He already has a wife.

245
01:04:07,537 --> 01:04:08,578
He has 15 wives.

246
01:04:08,698 --> 01:04:10,347
- 15?
- 15, 15.

247
01:04:11,155 --> 01:04:13,477
Their religion says
that you can have multiple wives.

248
01:04:14,049 --> 01:04:16,574
Here, he's a priest.

249
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:17,735
Ehhh, a priest.

250
01:04:18,058 --> 01:04:20,159
Priest without a stole.....
horse without a tail.

251
01:04:20,279 --> 01:04:21,615
Is he a Turk?

252
01:04:22,097 --> 01:04:24,309
I was in Turkey once,
in '77 during the war.

253
01:04:24,641 --> 01:04:25,452
Which war?

254
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:28,253
Which war?
In what world are you living?

255
01:04:28,935 --> 01:04:29,820
In the new world.

256
01:04:30,578 --> 01:04:34,726
Dear brother......
Now I'm upset.

257
01:04:43,115 --> 01:04:44,719
Don't you read the papers?

258
01:04:45,449 --> 01:04:47,716
How it's possible not to know,
that our country, Romania,

259
01:04:47,836 --> 01:04:49,762
3 years ago, in '77,

260
01:04:49,882 --> 01:04:52,140
had a war with Turkey,
at Grivita, Plevna?

261
01:04:53,468 --> 01:04:54,555
Give me some paper.

262
01:04:59,919 --> 01:05:00,546
So....

263
01:05:01,283 --> 01:05:04,270
We, the Transylvanians,
thought that we must go there.

264
01:05:05,394 --> 01:05:06,150
And we went.

265
01:05:07,517 --> 01:05:11,351
We'd seldom crossed the mountains before,
because it was fotbidden.

266
01:05:13,381 --> 01:05:16,367
Anyway, nobody can stop me,
when I want something.

267
01:05:16,773 --> 01:05:18,616
I've passed....

268
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:23,125
You know how much military service I've done,
at.........regiment.

269
01:05:26,326 --> 01:05:30,455
How was it possible to stay at home,
when our country, Romania, was fighting for freedom.

270
01:05:31,487 --> 01:05:32,501


271
01:05:31,487 --> 01:05:32,501
I was injured too.

272
01:05:33,053 --> 01:05:36,482
I've got my military
honors at Plevna.

273
01:05:41,176 --> 01:05:45,139
After my return to Poplaca,
the authorities were looking for me.

274
01:05:46,497 --> 01:05:48,488
And they asked me a lot
of questions.

275
01:05:50,949 --> 01:05:52,719
Because of the poverty,

276
01:05:53,132 --> 01:05:57,187
by the time I got that letter from you,
I was already on the road to this place.

277
01:05:57,307 --> 01:05:58,352
Look at him.

278
01:05:58,472 --> 01:06:00,050
I'm here for him.

279
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,668
So he can learn something.

280
01:06:03,093 --> 01:06:04,844
I've heard that here,
in America...

281
01:06:06,097 --> 01:06:06,724
Hey...

282
01:06:07,425 --> 01:06:08,420
Your brother,
Ion.

283
01:06:14,128 --> 01:06:16,340
Oh, Ion!

284
01:06:19,124 --> 01:06:20,322
Romi....

285
01:06:20,672 --> 01:06:21,667
you've grown.

286
01:06:28,886 --> 01:06:31,245
And Bob....
very happy.

287
01:06:33,579 --> 01:06:36,141
You saw that I'm wanted
for 500 dollars.

288
01:06:36,768 --> 01:06:37,653
Dead or alive.

289
01:06:39,146 --> 01:06:40,289
But, we'll see about this.

290
01:06:41,572 --> 01:06:45,037
Now that you're here,
we'll try to make some rules.

291
01:06:45,157 --> 01:06:45,738
No!

292
01:06:46,014 --> 01:06:47,434
No rules, we're going home.

293
01:06:47,968 --> 01:06:48,687
I have money.

294
01:06:49,461 --> 01:06:51,047
I've won it in one minute.

295
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:54,585
Hey, the people here are stupid
at playing their games.

296
01:06:54,705 --> 01:06:59,304
I was showing my cards,
they were giving me money....

297
01:07:00,355 --> 01:07:01,387
So, no rules.

298
01:07:02,332 --> 01:07:04,434
On the ship, and home.

299
01:07:04,554 --> 01:07:06,185
- Brother?
- Yeah?

300
01:07:07,752 --> 01:07:11,107
Sometimes the way back is 
longer.

301
01:07:11,503 --> 01:07:13,088
Look what I've found.

302
01:07:13,494 --> 01:07:14,470
What have you found?

303
01:07:15,228 --> 01:07:16,481
It looks like gold.

304
01:07:16,601 --> 01:07:18,380
Bob says that it's gold.

305
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,076
Yeah, you only see gold.

306
01:08:09,422 --> 01:08:10,657
I want to learn this.

307
01:08:10,777 --> 01:08:12,205
I'll teach you.

308
01:08:12,325 --> 01:08:13,274
Go to the bottles.

309
01:08:20,553 --> 01:08:24,369
Ion, are you calling that a gun?
Look here.

310
01:08:24,489 --> 01:08:26,120
I got this from the Turks.

311
01:08:29,443 --> 01:08:31,710
Romi...
Come here.

312
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:34,659
You can have this.

313
01:08:34,779 --> 01:08:38,217
If someone will shoot you,
I'm gonna kill you.

314
01:08:49,088 --> 01:08:50,544
You'll demolish the fence.

315
01:08:54,026 --> 01:08:54,911
Wait....

316
01:32:09,003 --> 01:32:12,561
Hey priest.....
get off the horse.

317
01:32:13,295 --> 01:32:15,433
We have some problems
to solve.

318
01:32:19,322 --> 01:32:20,281
Get down!

319
01:32:24,022 --> 01:32:24,980
Walk!

320
01:32:29,681 --> 01:32:30,547
Ion...

321
01:32:31,082 --> 01:32:32,243
I'll judge this one.

322
01:32:32,870 --> 01:32:34,879
Girl, Romi!

323
01:32:35,281 --> 01:32:36,166
Come here.

324
01:33:14,138 --> 01:33:15,760
You see?

325
01:33:16,774 --> 01:33:18,451
You tied me, right?

326
01:33:20,165 --> 01:33:21,824
And you whipped me!

327
01:33:22,839 --> 01:33:25,051
You've done all this to me,
to me?

328
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,167
You can't do this.

329
01:33:28,886 --> 01:33:30,950
I've faced the Turks...

330
01:33:48,066 --> 01:33:50,057
He doesn't even know how to fight.

331
01:35:04,521 --> 01:35:05,959
Romi!

332
01:35:06,346 --> 01:35:07,950
Are you missing my
slaps?

333
01:35:08,070 --> 01:35:09,516
Common, rub my back.

334
01:35:35,508 --> 01:35:36,504
Bob's place...

335
01:35:37,119 --> 01:35:37,841
with...

336
01:35:38,107 --> 01:35:38,785
the table.

337
01:35:49,316 --> 01:35:50,097
What is he saying?

338
01:35:51,670 --> 01:35:53,160
He says that he wants
to come with us.

339
01:35:54,693 --> 01:35:56,949
Wait till they see us with him
in Poplaca.

340
01:35:57,554 --> 01:35:58,719
Ion...

341
01:35:59,762 --> 01:36:00,573
Come here.

342
01:36:01,295 --> 01:36:03,861
Now, we're going home,
give me your toy.

343
01:36:04,836 --> 01:36:06,587
- Which toy?
- The gun.

344
01:36:35,207 --> 01:36:36,313
Ion?

345
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:38,193
What do you think?

346
01:36:38,313 --> 01:36:40,684
 -Can we find here a Romanian priest?
 - Yes.

347
01:36:41,532 --> 01:36:46,325
I'm afraid to not 
be ashamed.
