0
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,213
I have many girls.

1
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,932
Come. Come. I show you.

2
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,375
Look.

3
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,009
Nice?

4
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,379
I'll take this one.

5
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,729
Look.

6
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,253
What's wrong with her?

7
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,259
Bound feet.

8
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,691
Very special.

9
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,929
Yes?

10
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,094
I'll take her.

11
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,809
Sale.

12
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,979
I must be out of my mind

13
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,496
to be out here in the middle of nowhere
with these little bitches.

14
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,538
That's right. Eat up.

15
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,815
I need you girls nice and healthy.

16
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,897
Stop staring at me like that.

17
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,650
Maybe what you need is a lesson, huh?

18
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,296
That's what these girls need,

19
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,289
a lesson.

20
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,373
Just hold her there.

21
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,329
I got it.

22
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,216
Bring it in, Billy. Come on, let's go.

23
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,295
Keep it steady.

24
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,379
There you go.

25
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,410
I'm looking for a Tom Harte.

26
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,534
I'm his uncle.

27
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,258
Harte's got a family?

28
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,139
Who would have figured?

29
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,768
Tom, boy.

30
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,773
Young Tom.

31
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,297
Jack, this is my uncle, Print.

32
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,493
Print Ritter.

33
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,138
What brings you out this far?

34
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,652
I thought maybe you'd gone under.

35
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,809
No, sir.

36
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,811
I ain't gone under yet. No, sir.

37
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,293
But your mother did.

38
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,971
She passed away two weeks ago.

39
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,694
Her hired man found her
in the vegetable garden.

40
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,491
Is he taking care of the place now?

41
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,649
Yes, sir.

42
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,936
I need to say something straight out.

43
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,939
She wrote a will.

44
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,254
She left it all to me.
Now, I don't know why she done it,

45
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,138
or what was crossed between you two,
but she done it.

46
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,290
The land, the livestock, everything.

47
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,899
It ain't a fortune, but it's legit.

48
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,889
Is that it?

49
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,095
That's it.

50
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,455
Well, she did write this letter to you

51
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,174
a while back.

52
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,492
Your name, Tom, is on there.

53
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,052
I don't feel good about this at all.
That's why I come out here.

54
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,379
I want to talk.

55
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,175
You see,

56
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,934
your mother made me
the executor to her will.

57
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,253
She left everything to me,
except there was a codicil.

58
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,412
You could buy the old Fairburn place,

59
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,810
you know the two sections that run down
from the Steens to the Malheur,

60
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,859
from her estate,

61
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,573
if you've a mind to.

62
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,659
I can buy it?

63
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,532
Yeah. Market price.

64
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,931
The will's on file over the Burns.

65
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,372
Son of a bitch.

66
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,373
That's mother's milk.

67
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,409
Yeah.

68
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,218
More like hind tit.

69
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,777
You know, son, I don't like this
any more than you do

70
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,693
but I got this idea,
might be good for both of us.

71
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,897
I got this idea to take horses
back to Wyoming.

72
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,410
Listen to this, you're gonna like this.

73
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,853
Listen to this.

74
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,095
<i>"</i>Wanted,

75
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,091
<i>"</i>hot or cold-blooded horses.

76
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,057
<i>"</i>Sound and disease-free.

77
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,619
<i>"</i>Three to eight years of age.

78
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,373
<i>"</i>Purchase price commiserate

79
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,418
<i>"</i>Contact William Moncrieffe,
Sheridan, Wyoming.

80
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,811
<i>"</i>Agent for Her Majesty's War Office,
British Empire.<i>"</i>

81
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,973
What do you say?

82
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,618
Like that idea?

83
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,811
Why don't we take some of your ma's money
and buy a big string of horses?

84
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,698
Might be a handy way
to increase our capital.

85
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,814
And I'm thinking tough,
high-desert mustangs.

86
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,492
They can go unshod

87
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,970
and ought to be fairly broke
by the time we get to Sheridan.

88
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,934
On shares?

89
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,249
I figure

90
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,933
a 25-75 split on profits
after expenses and loan repayment.

91
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,090
- Loan repayment?
- To the bank.

92
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,490
I'd have to put the ranch up as collateral.

93
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,730
Well, what the shit kind of deal is that?

94
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,257
You take the family ranch
to borrow money to buy horses?

95
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,173
Well, that's...

96
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,932
That's one way of looking at it.

97
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,488
What's the other?

98
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,971
Well, you can stay here,
cutting the nuts off another man's cows

99
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,575
for chuck and wages till you're all
stove up and walking around like a crab,

100
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:56,050
like all the other bachelor cowhands
from here to the Dalles.

101
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,898
No disrespect meant.

102
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,728
Truth is,

103
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,650
you're as loose as ashes in the wind.

104
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,415
How many horses you say we can handle?

105
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,060
Three to five hundred head, give or take.

106
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,735
Well...

107
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,530
Good to see you're still riding old Bob Tate.

108
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,609
You bet.

109
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,011
So, you ready, buckaroo? Let's do it.

110
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,449
Keep going.

111
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,372
The other way.

112
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,496
Go the other way!

113
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,095
Just hold on.

114
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,216
Hold up. Just hold them up to the right.

115
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,019
You heard him.

116
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,379
Move them to the left.

117
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,135
Come on.

118
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,575
Let's do it!

119
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,417
Let's move them out.

120
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,458
Move it! Move it!

121
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,409
Let's move them out. Hold them!

122
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,179
Move them out east.

123
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,015
Let's go.

124
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,653
Get them to a run.

125
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,815
Nothing like a 10-mile romp

126
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,218
to knock the edge off them.

127
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,009
Figured out who's gonna be the caporal
of this mob, Mr Ritter?

128
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,739
I'd say that stout grey,
that flea-bitten mare right there.

129
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,538
You're gonna have your hands full,
Mr Ritter.

130
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,259
You sure you don't want
a couple of us to go along?

131
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,058
No, boys, we can handle it.

132
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,619
That ought to about do it, Vick.
Appreciate the help.

133
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,089
Thank you. See you next spring.

134
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,454
Plan on it.

135
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,009
Come on, boys.

136
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,933
Come on now, boys.

137
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,894
Gonna walk them all the way
to Wyoming, Nephew.

138
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,175
Walk them in the morning.

139
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,252
Graze them at night, all night,
and let them rest.

140
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,810
We don't want to come in
with a bunch of skin and bones. No, sir.

141
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,010
When the Indians first laid eyes on them,

142
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,772
they called them <i>"</i>god dogs.<i>"</i>

143
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,335
<i>"</i>God dogs<i>"</i>?

144
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,696
Yeah, it was the Spanish in them.
Been on the loose for a long time.

145
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,209
Yeah, we ought to think about
coming up here and spending next summer.

146
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,209
Yeah.

147
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,490
Let's get your herd delivered first.

148
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,054
It's a damn sight more yours than it is mine.

149
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,938
Well, I don't feel that way.
Don't think your ma would either.

150
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,975
<i>"</i>Tom.

151
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,815
<i>"</i>As you seem to have had
little interest in the homestead,

152
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,211
<i>"</i>I see no reason to burden you
with its ownership.

153
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,129
<i>"</i>You are free to pursue
your own opportunities.

154
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,574
<i>"</i>Your mother.<i>"</i>

155
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,939
Not very generous.

156
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,652
She never got over
my running off to buckaroo.

157
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,169
Yeah.

158
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,859
Losing your pa made her a hard woman.

159
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,895
Still,

160
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,650
I sent money home after every season.

161
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,414
You know,

162
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,379
sometimes I look up there,
I see those lights,

163
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,178
I think maybe the Old Man

164
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,174
is not too happy with the way
things are down here.

165
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,089
Yeah.

166
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,374
It's funny,

167
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,653
I always got the feeling
it meant he was pleased.

168
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,849
Yeah.

169
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,419
It's a great life

170
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,771
when it ain't raining or snowing.

171
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,655
Come on, boys.

172
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,934
Come on, boys.

173
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,650
Come on, boys. Let's go. Come on.

174
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,130
Nephew, let's go.

175
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,935
Get going.

176
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,492
Wyoming's waiting on us.

177
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,174
Let's do it.

178
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,819
They say Wyoming's hell
on women and horses.

179
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,256
We're going to find out soon enough,
at least one aspect of it.

180
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,373
Where is he taking us?

181
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,539
Our families sold us into service.

182
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,091
He must be very rich to need five servants.

183
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,094
This is not a rich man's cart.

184
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,896
Maybe he plans to kill us.

185
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,290
Why would he buy us just to kill us?

186
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,976
He does not plan to kill us.

187
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,693
But I think we may wish he did.

188
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,779
You girls shut up.

189
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,889
I'm sick of listening to that cackling.

190
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,418
- You feel like going in for supplies?
- Sure.

191
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,972
Go easy on the whisky.

192
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:20,018
It don't always suit your temperament.
And don't dawdle.

193
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,849
I don't want to be having to worry
about coming to fetch you.

194
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,494
Thank you.

195
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,735
Ma'am.

196
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,969
Howdy.

197
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,493
Hi, can I help you?

198
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,457
I need supplies.

199
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,728
Flour,

200
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,094
bacon,

201
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,332
four sacks of Arbuckles,

202
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,298
some cut tobacco,

203
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,172
and four boxes of therapeutic papers.

204
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,973
Anything else?

205
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,768
You sell whisky?

206
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,055
No, sir. Up the hill at the saloon.

207
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,653
They'll take care of you.

208
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,575
Hi.

209
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,689
Howdy.

210
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,897
Get a shot of whisky
and three bottles to take away?

211
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,453
I thought I told you yesterday,
no panhandling in here.

212
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,417
It's a free country.
I got a right to earn a living.

213
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,013
Not in here. Let's go.

214
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,730
I'd like to hear him play the fiddle.

215
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,332
And who the hell are you?

216
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,729
Just a fellow that enjoys fiddle playing.

217
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,015
I'll kick the both of youse out then. Let's go.

218
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,889
Want a drink?

219
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,499
Don't mind if I do.

220
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,174
It's on him.

221
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,412
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

222
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,289
Much obliged.

223
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,973
I hired a new man.

224
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,809
What for?

225
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,656
I thought you might like some music.

226
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,218
And that's his purpose?

227
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,173
That and to help out with the nighthawking
and pull that pack horse around.

228
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,448
- Does he have a name?
- Yes, sir.

229
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,539
Henry Gilpin.

230
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,053
But you can call me Heck.

231
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,728
All right, Hank.

232
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,732
We'll see what you can do.

233
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,731
Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.

234
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,848
Thank you.

235
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,134
Nature's call.

236
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,254
Man guaranteed me
those therapeutic papers

237
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,012
wouldn't have any splinters in them.

238
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,653
Let you judge that.

239
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,609
Hey, I was thinking we ought to stay off
the main trail as long as possible.

240
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,577
Probably be better forage anyway.

241
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,811
Okay with me
long as the river crossings ain't bad.

242
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,219
How's it going?

243
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,860
Find any wood chips or splinters?

244
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,489
I tell you, it beats corncobs
and sage grass any day.

245
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,935
Yes, sir.

246
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,249
Morning.

247
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,253
Y'all off to church?

248
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,689
No, indeed.

249
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,013
Captain Billy Fender.

250
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,728
Gentlemen,

251
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,615
as you can see, I have purchased,
at a great expense mind you,

252
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,370
five exotic virgins from the Celestial Empire.

253
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,340
I'm headed out to the mining camps,
where those men out there

254
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:29,015
will pay good money to deflower
one of these little lotus blossoms.

255
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,014
You seem to be travelling
in the same direction.

256
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,373
You gents mind if I tag along?
God only knows I can use the company.

257
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,896
Conversation's been a bit thin.

258
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,288
Pick that up!

259
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,616
Put some more wood on that fire.

260
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,493
Got a couple of extra rabbits,
if you'd care to join us.

261
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,979
Don't mind if I do.

262
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,093
Drink up, gents.

263
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,855
Gentlemen,

264
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,972
I don't mind confiding in you, but I have
a little problem on my hands here.

265
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,058
I was supposed to deliver virgins,

266
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,453
but since I left San Francisco
I deflowered one,

267
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,217
which cuts back on her

268
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,536
enhanced value considerably.

269
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,048
You know, it must be an acquired taste. I...

270
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,494
I don't understand it.

271
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,016
I like to have a gal that
knows what the hell she's doing.

272
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:36,376
But some men will pay a big price
to get that first slice of the cake.

273
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,732
I'll tell you what, gents.

274
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,492
If you're interested,

275
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,057
I'll let you have a stab at the almost virgin
for a buck apiece.

276
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,573
How does that sound?

277
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,135
I'll pass.

278
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,889
Hey.

279
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,656
Get me another bottle out of my bag.

280
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,179
Not you, her.

281
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,409
Her.

282
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,890
I tell you they are as dumb as dirt.

283
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,696
Give me that. Get out of here.

284
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,978
Jesus, what's wrong with her feet?

285
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,648
Her feet?

286
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,173
I'll tell you.

287
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,377
In China, when they're little girls,
they take their feet

288
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,132
and they break their toes.

289
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,534
And they bind them up
underneath real tight.

290
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,258
You know why they do that?

291
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,574
'Cause it gives them a stronger sex desire.

292
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,290
Yeah, those guys at the mines
will pay premium for that one.

293
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,616
How about another one, gents?

294
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,538
This is the last one for me.

295
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,609
Okay.

296
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,897
Here have another one. There.

297
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,212
I'll take just a touch.

298
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,972
Oh, that's plenty. That's plenty.

299
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,415
Last one.

300
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,933
Oh, God, he will be drunk again.

301
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,970
This man has abused us.

302
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,817
Now there are three more men.

303
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,419
We are ruined.

304
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,818
Maybe they are not like him.

305
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,773
- Can you play that fiddle?
- I do.

306
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,056
- Why don't you play me a little tune?
- Well, not tonight, Captain.

307
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,929
Come on, you know what,
play me a nice Irish jig that I can dance to.

308
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,248
You know, I love to dance.

309
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,296
I tell you, I used to be a good...

310
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,729
I used to be a good dancer in my day.

311
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,216
Not tonight. I think I'll pass.

312
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,377
He who sins when drunk

313
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,811
shall be punished when sober.

314
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,735
Amen.

315
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,729
Amen.

316
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,659
Are they dead?

317
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,015
Hey.

318
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,169
Gilpin.

319
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,334
Print.

320
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,492
My money belt's gone.

321
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,494
Oh, shit! My money belt's gone.

322
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,889
Shit!

323
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,211
Where's our money and horses?

324
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,214
Easy, boy.
They sure as shit didn't take them.

325
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:02,216
That little weasel doctored the bug juice

326
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,377
and swapped stock on us.

327
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,292
What idiots. All of us.

328
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,053
What idiots, all of us. Idiots.

329
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,017
At least we're still heeled.

330
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,533
You wait here.

331
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,848
What're you doing?

332
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,374
I'll tell you what I'm doing,
I'm going after that jackass.

333
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,178
I'll get our money back.

334
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,013
Yeah, well, make sure you get back.

335
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,655
Ladies,

336
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,531
it's about time we was introduced.

337
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,173
Hey, now.

338
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,538
Okay. All right.

339
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,739
Here's the deal.

340
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,295
Now,

341
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,132
you're gonna be Number One.

342
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,529
All right?

343
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,493
Could you say <i>"</i>One<i>"</i>?

344
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,457
One. You're One.

345
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,815
One.

346
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,849
One.

347
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,529
One.

348
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,655
Very good.

349
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,168
You're Two.

350
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,733
- Say <i>"</i>Two.<i>"</i>
- Two.

351
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,731
No, no, she's Two, you're One.

352
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,728
One. Two.

353
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,255
Say <i>"</i>Two.<i>"</i>

354
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,450
Two. Say <i>"</i>Two.<i>"</i> Say <i>"</i>Two.<i>"</i>

355
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,453
- Two.
- Two.

356
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,053
Good. Very good.

357
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,653
Now you, you're Three.

358
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,059
- Three.
- Three.

359
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,579
- Three.
- Very good.

360
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,977
And she's going to be Number Four.

361
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,288
Number four, number four.

362
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,495
She doesn't want four.
It's bad luck, means death.

363
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,979
Four. You're Four.

364
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,017
I don't want to die.

365
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,619
She doesn't want to be Four?

366
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,775
I don't want to die.

367
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,449
She can be Number Five.

368
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,575
It's okay, don't be scared.

369
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,810
When Tom brings your sister back,
she'll be Four. All right?

370
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,219
So, that's what?

371
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,254
Get it right or I'm gonna paint numbers
on your back.

372
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,375
One.

373
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,449
- Two.
- Two.

374
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,768
Three. Four.

375
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,657
- And little Number Five.
- Five.

376
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,890
Give me a smile. Little Number Five?

377
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,738
Five. Five.

378
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,935
Good.

379
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,415
Good.

380
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,216
Dance now, son of a bitch.

381
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,099
Good.

382
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,178
Number Five. Yum, yum.

383
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,132
- Ye Fung.
- Ye Fung.

384
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,218
- Ye Fung.
- Ye Fung!

385
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,053
- Ye Fung!
- Ye Fung!

386
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,808
He did it.

387
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,814
Bring her here.

388
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,299
Put her by the fire.

389
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,454
Was he sober?

390
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,814
What's that?

391
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,697
Captain Fender, was he sober?

392
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:01,571
He said, <i>"</i>If you sin when you're drunk,
you'll have to pay when you're sober.<i>"</i>

393
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,699
He was sober enough.

394
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,892
You ain't been introduced.

395
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,135
Ladies.

396
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,213
Ladies, this here's Tom.
Everybody say <i>"</i>Tom.<i>"</i>

397
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,329
Tom.

398
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,809
Tom.

399
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,375
Tom.

400
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,819
Tom.

401
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,174
Tom.

402
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,208
Very, very good.

403
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,133
Tom, this is

404
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,494
Number One,

405
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,615
Two,

406
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,175
Three,

407
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,609
Four.

408
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,098
That's little Number Five.

409
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,375
Now, there you go.
Everybody knows everybody.

410
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,569
Thank you.

411
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,132
So what do they call you?

412
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,169
Ladies,

413
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,408
who am I?

414
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,854
Honkle Pren.

415
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,613
Honkle Pren.

416
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,254
<i>"</i>Honkle Pren.<i>"</i>

417
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,534
Uncle Pren, huh?

418
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,295
Yeah.

419
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,328
So I went and got horses and our money,

420
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,251
and I had to stretch a fellow,

421
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,532
while you started a finishing school
for Chinese girls.

422
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,499
You all right, son?

423
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,293
Yeah, I'm all right.

424
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,011
I left my rope back there, though.

425
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,095
Listen,

426
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,289
man like that ain't worth the food he eats

427
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,655
much less the price of a decent rope.

428
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,653
I think these masters will be kind.

429
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,339
The young one killed our last master.

430
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,092
To save Ye Fung.

431
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,372
I was not saved.

432
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,852
But you are alive.

433
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,532
No, I am a ghost.

434
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,858
Take that back. It's bad luck.

435
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,170
My luck cannot get worse.

436
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,536
You will curse us all.

437
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,853
I entered the 18th hell a long time ago.

438
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,772
We are already cursed.

439
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,849
Stop it.

440
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,852
She only has us. We only have each other.

441
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,173
Hey, darling.

442
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,294
A little magic here now, a little magic.

443
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,369
See?

444
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,255
See?

445
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,418
This is the way you eat it, see?

446
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,331
You open it up. Like that.

447
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,569
See?

448
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,609
You eat it.

449
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,214
See, like this.

450
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,019
It's called a peanut.

451
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,579
Okay, you eat it.

452
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,412
They're sure gonna be
a hell of a drag on our trail time.

453
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:46,259
Nephew, if they was five ladies
from Canyon City, telling us what to do,

454
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:51,498
with all the gaggling and prattling going on,
we'd be ready to slit our throats.

455
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:56,295
Even so, I'll feel better
when we find a safe place to leave them.

456
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,816
Get back to the task at hand.

457
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,569
Yeah.

458
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,889
If you don't eat, you will get sick.

459
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:12,332
If you get sick,

460
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,294
they will leave us behind.

461
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,449
Please eat, Ye Fung.

462
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,730
Don't make them leave us behind.

463
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,449
I don't want to.

464
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,535
Eat.

465
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:33,214
Let's go.

466
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,418
Now, miss, you grab this horn, see,
and one, two, three.

467
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,890
There you go. Put your leg over. That's it.

468
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,449
Good.

469
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,254
It's easy.

470
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,688
Easy, all right.

471
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,489
Okay.

472
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,530
Hold on. Hold on.

473
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:56,009
There you go. You'll be fine.

474
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,534
Come on. Come on. Come on.

475
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,374
Come on. Another short man in the West.
Come on.

476
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,815
Come on, now. Come on. You're doing fine.

477
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:05,935
Easy.

478
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,416
There you go. There you go.

479
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,939
That's okay. You're doing great. Come on.

480
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,490
Come on. Come on.

481
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:19,010
Look at Number Five. She's got it licked.
Come on. Come on.

482
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,894
Come on. Attagirl.

483
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,289
Come on.

484
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:25,849
Yeah.

485
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:28,978
Attagirl. You're doing great.

486
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,331
How'd you like it? Really?

487
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,019
You liked that, didn't you? Come on down.

488
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,489
Told you you could do it. Now grab hold.

489
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:47,090
Found your balance all right.

490
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,455
Good.

491
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:49,775
Yeah.

492
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,295
Told you you could do it.

493
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,778
What? Huh?

494
00:45:58,620 --> 00:45:59,655
Yeah?

495
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,533
You betcha.

496
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,817
I agree with everything you say. That's right.

497
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,455
Go!

498
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,574
Go! Go!

499
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,335
Whoa!

500
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,734
Don't watch, turn your heads.

501
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:57,935
Turn your heads.

502
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,940
Mai Ling, turn your head.

503
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,008
What happened?

504
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,374
Come on. Come on.

505
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,098
Giddyup. Giddyup.

506
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,735
Busted foreleg on that big sorrel.

507
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,294
Afternoon.

508
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,859
To you as well.

509
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:52,255
Whoa.

510
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:56,849
Are you boys local or just passing through?

511
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,579
Heading north.

512
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,379
Up from old Mexico?

513
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,933
No, from Navarra.

514
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,897
Navarra, Spain. We're Basque.

515
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,894
A friend or enemy?

516
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,490
A friend, I think.

517
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,335
Yes, a friend.

518
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:18,739
What's your name?

519
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,413
Valentin Ugalde.

520
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,615
Print Ritter.

521
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,540
Now, how's it out east of here?
You been there?

522
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:27,452
We're heading north.

523
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:30,008
Some Paiutes jumped the reservation.

524
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,658
Thanks for the heads up.

525
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,976
Now, let me ask you something.

526
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,571
Can I buy one of them sheep off you?

527
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,049
We're about played out on rabbit these days.

528
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:44,610
You buy the lamb,
I'll cook it for you tonight.

529
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,252
A new menu tonight.

530
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,693
- Yeah?
- Lamb.

531
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:04,978
Sounds good to me.

532
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,449
Man says there's Paiute trouble to the east.

533
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:09,697
Recommend we change course.

534
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:13,216
We go south there's nothing but
blowed out country all the way to Ogden.

535
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,653
Let's head north.

536
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,892
You're the boss.

537
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:19,172
Sure does smell good.

538
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,255
There.

539
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,134
They overcook and ruin the lamb.

540
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,929
Am I doing this right?

541
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,134
Yes.

542
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:32,809
Girls.

543
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,129
Try that. No?

544
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,255
No, we don't eat that, but thanks.

545
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,979
No? All right.

546
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:40,812
That stuff stinks.

547
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:44,289
We've been using the wrong bait.

548
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,737
- Try this here.
- Oh, yeah.

549
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,776
- You know what, give me one.
- Here we go.

550
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:51,090
I got it. Give me that one.

551
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,216
- Give it here.
- Oh, so good.

552
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,931
It's okay. Try that.

553
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,415
Go on.

554
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:58,649
Yeah.

555
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,890
First peanuts, and now this.

556
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:05,010
- Here you go, ladies.
- Try some of Mr Ritter's biscuits.

557
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,529
All right, come on. Thank you.

558
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,049
I tell you, Nephew,
we were fishing with the wrong bait.

559
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,251
Go in there, Hank.
And now, One, Two, Three, Four.

560
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:25,978
Where's Number Two?

561
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:29,291
Gilpin, cut one of them biscuits in half,
put some more jam on it for Number Two.

562
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,211
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

563
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,734
Where is Number Two? Where's she at?

564
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,098
She don't look good.

565
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,377
Hell, man, she's on fire.

566
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,978
Is she dying?

567
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:17,376
Hank, what do you make of this?

568
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,773
What's that?

569
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:30,534
Let's see.

570
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,048
That's a tick.

571
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:38,178
Probably tick fever.

572
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,419
That ain't good.

573
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:44,095
No, it's as bad as milk fever is
in young ones.

574
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:48,530
Let me go get these girls
and we'll check them for ticks, too.

575
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:51,180
- What else can I do?
- You're doing it.

576
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,933
You got any pull with the Almighty,
you might wanna speak up for her.

577
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:00,459
We're not properly equipped or suited
to take care of these girls, I tell you.

578
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,338
Let's pay our respects.

579
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,249
Mai Ling.

580
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:16,339
We wish you a good journey.

581
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,375
Come on.

582
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:32,417
Goodbye, Mai Ling, little sister.

583
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,815
You have anything you want to say?

584
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:47,732
Said it last night.

585
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:51,089
Okay.

586
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,731
The second time I've done this.

587
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:02,492
It don't get any easier.

588
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:06,691
We're all travellers in this world.

589
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:11,054
From the sweet grass to the packing house.

590
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,572
Birth till death.

591
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:20,413
We travel between the eternities.

592
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:57,809
Nephew.

593
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:29,249
Whoa.

594
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:31,255
Whoa.

595
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:35,694
Howdy.

596
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:40,338
Horse took a wrong step in a creek
a ways back and snapped his cannon bone.

597
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:16,529
Whoa!

598
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:22,859
Got a cheque here. Think you could cash it?

599
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:27,568
How long's a man got to stay in prison
to come out with $17.45?

600
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:29,977
Awful nosy, ain't you?

601
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:41,091
Hitch that team up, and let's go!

602
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:42,579
- Hey.
- You heard him.

603
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:43,854
Hey there.

604
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,649
Come here, darling. Have a seat on my lap.

605
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:19,416
Glad to see your business has been
good to you since I've been away.

606
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,411
Your timing couldn't be any better.

607
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,013
- Really?
- Really.

608
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:25,972
Remember Billy Fender?

609
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:28,018
Captain Billy Fender?

610
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:29,813
That's the one.

611
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,931
That's the kind of a shit-house rat
you always want to stay upwind of.

612
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:36,693
I don't pay people for taking baths.

613
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:39,169
I sent him to pick up and deliver back to me

614
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:42,775
a load of Chinese girls I bought
from an associate in San Francisco.

615
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,451
Well, he's way overdue.

616
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:49,296
Knowing him, he's probably
drunk on his ass and hobbling all your girls.

617
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:52,176
I got a proposition for you.

618
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:53,929
Yep?

619
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:57,970
I'll pay you to go find him
and bring those girls back to me.

620
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,415
No.

621
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:03,735
Maybe later.

622
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:07,218
Right now all I want is a bottle
and some trim.

623
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,333
I got some new gals
I can turn you loose with.

624
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:18,813
What about Nola?

625
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:26,015
Is she still around, Nola?

626
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,930
Why don't you try some of the new talent?

627
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:36,857
I kind of had my mind set on Nola
for some time now.

628
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:59,659
Coming through.

629
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:07,734
Hello, Nola.

630
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,298
It's been a while.

631
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:12,657
Where have you been, Ed?

632
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,136
Oh, I think you know where I've been.

633
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:19,733
I figured you must have moved on
to other business.

634
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:21,048
Yeah, right.

635
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,252
Working for the government.

636
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:25,653
Three cents a day

637
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:28,494
making little rocks out of big rocks.

638
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:34,296
Been thinking a lot about you.

639
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:36,858
Not much else to do.

640
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,177
Does Kate know you're here?

641
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:43,968
Oh, yeah.

642
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:47,415
She sent me up especially for you.

643
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:59,409
You got orders to wear me out.

644
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,774
Come on, boy.

645
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,215
Come on, boy.

646
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:15,335
Come on.

647
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:17,779
Come on, boy.

648
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:48,614
Problem?

649
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:50,088
Not sure.

650
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,415
Whoa.

651
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:58,815
Move off to their right. Keep your distance.

652
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,094
Watch me.

653
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:02,974
- Hank, let's hold up here.
- Yes, sir.

654
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:13,012
No, don't do that.

655
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:15,453
Just watch me.

656
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,134
All right.

657
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:33,251
Hold up there, mister.

658
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:34,933
Hold up, mister.

659
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,493
Don't I know you?

660
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,413
What's your name?

661
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,810
My name is my own business.
I suggest you tend to yours.

662
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,777
Will you give me the road, sir?

663
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:45,975
Hold on!

664
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:49,658
I know who you are.

665
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:53,170
I go by several names.
I doubt any of them are your concern.

666
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:56,338
If you refuse to let me pass,
you'll soon learn a few of them.

667
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:58,570
Well, would one be Jack Ketch?

668
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:02,970
If that's who you think I am,
then you know better than to block my path.

669
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:04,857
Hold on there, mister!

670
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:25,855
Don't let him get away! Kill him.

671
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:27,658
And you kill his horse.

672
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:43,654
Big Bob.

673
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:56,336
I got him. I got him dead centre.

674
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:58,172
Right through the heart. I got him.

675
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:01,138
Stay back, Heck. Don't go there, stay back.
I got him.

676
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:02,775
Yes, sir.

677
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:09,338
What the hell was that? We killed two men!

678
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:13,015
About as close as you'll ever get
to seeing the Grim Reaper.

679
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,614
Bullshit. Make sense to me, Uncle.

680
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:18,612
- Boys, I'm talking death.
- Horseshit.

681
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:21,373
We just killed two men
and all their livestock!

682
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:24,690
I told you to stay back!

683
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:30,133
That there is most likely
the infamous Smallpox Bob. I'm sure of it.

684
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:33,337
Probably killed more red men than any
one man in the Northwest.

685
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:36,218
- Hell, I ain't never heard of him.
- I have.

686
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:40,816
He trades blankets and hides with the tribes,
mostly infected with smallpox.

687
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,289
Smallpox, typhoid, tuberculosis.

688
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:46,099
He was death travelling the country,
but no more.

689
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:49,172
Well, if there was ever an evil bastard
worth killing, I reckon he's the one.

690
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:51,251
No more evil than the ones that hire him.

691
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:54,935
Boys, I tell you, we gotta tend to this mess.

692
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:29,015
That's the second rope I've lost
to some worthless son of a bitch.

693
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:31,489
I'd say both were for a good cause.

694
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:08,373
You really think that fellow killed
that many Indians, Mr Ritter?

695
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,769
Of course I do, Hank.
That's why I killed him.

696
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:11,451
What do you think they will do with us?

697
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:13,856
It's not just up to our protectors.

698
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:17,729
If we are to live, we must have courage.

699
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:21,175
I didn't see you help Ye Fung

700
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:24,656
when that man attacked her.

701
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:42,449
Look, she is coming.

702
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:47,219
There. Right up there.

703
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:54,458
It's only the moon.

704
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:57,898
You think she will save us?

705
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:01,892
Ghee Moon, enough. That's enough.

706
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:11,850
She comes over the fields of our village.

707
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:14,612
We must be close to home.

708
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:17,854
You are right.

709
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:23,058
She will follow us.

710
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:26,737
And lead us home.

711
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:29,012
She is barely visible.

712
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:32,050
But the moon is like us.

713
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:35,890
Sometimes she has to hide.

714
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:39,773
But she stands strong.

715
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,411
So we must be good to one another.

716
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:48,493
We must be brave.

717
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:28,695
Gilpin.

718
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:34,289
Hey.

719
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:38,851
Wake up, it's your shift.

720
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:42,729
Oh, Lord, I thought I just dozed off.

721
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:45,209
Yeah. About four hours ago.

722
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:54,539
Wouldn't mind getting
a full night's sleep sometime soon.

723
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:56,656
Well, you can when we get to Cariboo.

724
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:58,219
Are we really going in there?

725
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:00,336
Yeah. That's what my uncle said.

726
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:03,611
- Wake me up in four hours.
- Okay.

727
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:11,255
Damn it.

728
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:04,978
Herd is pretty settled.

729
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:08,895
I'll stay out here and watch things.

730
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:13,889
I want you to take the girls into this town

731
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:17,930
and see if you can find some
civil authority to take them.

732
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:19,612
Take Heck with you.

733
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:24,053
- I thought you'd be the one to do that.
- Well, you thought wrong.

734
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:26,693
Well, why here? Why now?

735
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:28,930
Well, you're the one that's so hot
to get rid of them.

736
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:31,251
- According to who?
- You.

737
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:35,011
Now just go and get it done.

738
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:45,219
Why did they argue?

739
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:46,773
Wait.

740
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:53,849
Heck, get everybody in the wagon.
We're going into town.

741
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:02,775
I got to be honest, Tom. I'm not so sure
about this. I think they might...

742
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:05,579
Well, you know what? I don't have a vote.
You don't have a vote.

743
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:07,579
That's becoming evident.

744
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:10,058
Just get them in the wagon.

745
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:14,735
- All right, ladies. Let's go.
- Tom.

746
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:17,293
We're going into town.

747
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:21,217
Let's go, girls, come on.

748
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:20,658
I still ain't seen Billy Fender
and that load of Chinese girls I bought.

749
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:25,617
- I'm still offering to pay you to find them.
- No.

750
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:28,211
I got business of my own in mind.

751
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:34,420
All you know how to do
is what got you sent up for.

752
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,536
It's small fry that gets sent up.

753
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,297
I'm looking to get big.

754
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:44,176
- You could be my banker.
- Lf I'm your bank, you're working for me.

755
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,852
You're a good businesswoman.

756
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:52,056
You know how to get a return
on your investment.

757
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:55,534
$500 will get me started just fine.

758
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:47,735
Howdy.

759
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:49,856
- Whoa.
- Good day to you, sir.

760
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:54,969
- You be needing a room?
- Yes, sir.

761
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:57,092
Two rooms for one night.

762
01:16:57,180 --> 01:16:59,136
It's $4, up front.

763
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:01,051
Is there a mayor in this town?

764
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:03,093
Not hardly.

765
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:05,410
- What about a town council?
- Nope.

766
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:11,577
- Do you have a sheriff?
- No, sir, not anymore.

767
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:13,929
Mister,

768
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:17,340
this town is as rough as cob.

769
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:18,815
It's hard on lawmen.

770
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,733
Hard enough to put two of them
in the ground over the last three years.

771
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:23,697
Well, who's in charge?

772
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:27,773
Well, the town sort of works on
a live-and-let-live basis with

773
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:30,768
a touch of every man for himself thrown in.

774
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:35,976
Ain't the kind of place where you check
your firearms when you get to town.

775
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:37,209
One minute.

776
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:40,053
Biggest operator is Miss Kate Becker.

777
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:44,091
Big Rump Kate.
She runs the Southern Cross Saloon.

778
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:52,051
Who are them girls, anyway?

779
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:53,974
They're with me.

780
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:56,528
Well, these rooms are for sleeping,
not for cooching.

781
01:17:56,620 --> 01:18:00,215
Good. Because these girls are tired
and they need their sleep.

782
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:03,773
Well, that room down at the end
has got cots for six men,

783
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:06,579
so I guess you ought to have enough space.

784
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:11,731
You know where a fellow can get a bath?

785
01:18:57,460 --> 01:18:59,496
- You speak English?
- Yes.

786
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:05,094
- My name's Tom Harte. What's your name?
- Lung Hay. My name is Lung Hay.

787
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:06,928
Long Hay.

788
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:08,852
Dragon. Lung.

789
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:10,689
Dragon.

790
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:15,578
Well, Mr Lung Hay,

791
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:18,849
through a series of circumstances,

792
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:23,411
fate has placed four Chinese girls
in the hands of me and my uncle.

793
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:27,575
They got room for our horses
over at the livery.

794
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:29,332
- Good.
- Who's this?

795
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:32,691
- He's our new interpreter, Mr Lung Hay.
- Lung Hay.

796
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,252
Lord knows we need it.

797
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:54,334
All right.

798
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:57,737
Tell them that I'm sorry about
everything that's happened to them.

799
01:19:57,820 --> 01:20:01,972
But we'll try and find a safe place for them.
No harm will come to them.

800
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:15,378
They say they want to stay with you.
Please to be good as to not leave them.

801
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:18,293
No, no.
No, they can't live on the trail with us.

802
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:21,819
Ask him why.

803
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:27,850
This is an old story.
There's no place safe for them.

804
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:29,574
Nowhere.

805
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:34,094
They will be like meat before hungry dogs.
They'll be devoured.

806
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:36,172
Not to make you angry,

807
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:40,378
but it would be more of a kindness
to cut their throats than to leave them here.

808
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:42,134
But they can't stay with us.

809
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:45,018
We've got to get our horses
through the passes before winter.

810
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:48,653
This whole land is not safe.
You tell him that.

811
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:53,089
Could you watch them
while we go get some supper

812
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:55,819
and maybe feed them some of your food?

813
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:58,098
- Yes, I can do.
- Thank you, sir.

814
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:13,939
<i>Goodbye, Old Paint, I'm leaving Cheyenne</i>

815
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:17,772
<i>Goodbye, Old Paint, I'm leaving Cheyenne</i>

816
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:20,530
<i>Leaving Cheyenne</i>

817
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:22,292
<i>On to Montana</i>

818
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:24,937
<i>Goodbye, Old Paint</i>

819
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:28,211
<i>leaving Cheyenne</i>

820
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,211
<i>Goodbye, Old Paint</i>

821
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:33,929
<i>leaving Cheyenne</i>

822
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:40,818
My little girls.

823
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:45,299
<i>Adis,</i>

824
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:48,256
One, Three, Four and Five.

825
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:01,573
It seems like we're drifting from our purpose

826
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:04,380
of delivering those horses to Sheridan.

827
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:08,055
But I'm not as hard-hearted
about those girls as you might think.

828
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:12,618
I'm not gonna just chuck them
at the first opportunity.

829
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:16,018
Nobility, no boundaries.

830
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:22,772
- Evening, gents.
- Evening, ma'am.

831
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:25,610
I'm Kate Becker. Big Rump Kate.

832
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:27,816
How's your supper? You doing all right?

833
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:29,333
We are, thank you.

834
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:31,536
Nothing like a bath, some clean britches,

835
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:34,293
a little whisky and a steak
to make a man feel almost human again.

836
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:37,099
Well, that ain't all a man need to feel human.

837
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:40,855
How about finishing off the evening
with some high-dollar sporting gals?

838
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:45,092
Well, I reckon a fellow can only handle
so much humanity at one time, ma'am.

839
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:46,768
Hey, Rose.

840
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:52,013
I call her my English Rose. Newest gal
to work the line. Come here, sweetie.

841
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:56,538
Rose, we got a stout lad here that
needs the knots worked out of him.

842
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:03,095
I think I speak for both of us
when I say I think we'll pass.

843
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:07,409
Well, maybe you prefer getting some trim
from those Celestials you brung into town.

844
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:12,093
You boys thinking about
getting into the skin trade?

845
01:23:12,180 --> 01:23:13,818
Well, let me set you straight.

846
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:18,856
The gold I mine from this burg,
I don't get from digging.

847
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:22,259
There ain't a shot of whisky,
a hand of poker,

848
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:25,855
or any fellow that wants to dip his wick
that I don't get a cut of.

849
01:23:25,940 --> 01:23:27,976
We're just passing through.

850
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:31,736
You know about a Billy Fender?
Captain Billy Fender?

851
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:34,814
Those girls were bought and paid for,
and you know it.

852
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:37,175
I don't give a damn about Billy Fender.

853
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:39,093
But they're mine!

854
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:48,776
Well, it's a stupid sack of shit

855
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:52,250
who believes he can waltz into this country
with a wagon full of women

856
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:54,092
and thinks he ain't in for trouble.

857
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:56,816
You kiss your mama with that mouth?

858
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:01,576
What do you take for your troubles?

859
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:05,016
We came here to eat and
have a little bit of whisky. That's it.

860
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:09,175
Come on, mister. Everything has a price.

861
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:12,459
Not everything.

862
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:19,574
Come on, Rose.

863
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:42,974
What's going on?

864
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:52,452
Come on, damn it!

865
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:02,853
Hold her still!

866
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:07,100
Come on, darling.
You know you want it. Come on!

867
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:33,848
Stay down!

868
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:42,211
Get over here. Get over here.

869
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:43,335
Stay back.

870
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:45,536
You girls get together. Stay back.

871
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:51,853
You like to spoil women? Do you?

872
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:07,848
Come on.

873
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:14,733
- Will you take me with you?
- Go on.

874
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:16,534
Come on.

875
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:23,649
Come on.

876
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:11,295
Boys.

877
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:15,415
You ready to donate your nuts?
Get your hands away from those pistols.

878
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:16,933
Do it now!

879
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:22,419
What about my property?

880
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:26,459
That's the price of being a capitalist, lady.
Now back off!

881
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:29,769
Heck.

882
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:32,459
Let's go, Heck.

883
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:44,617
Just remember,
it's money that greases the wheels, mister.
