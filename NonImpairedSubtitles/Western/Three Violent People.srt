1
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,789
It happens a dozen times
a day, Captain...

2
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,833
these fights between our returning
soldiers and those carpetbaggers.

3
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,550
And every time,
it's a Confederate who winds up in jail.

4
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,036
My advice is not to get into it.

5
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,357
I have no intention of getting into it,
Mr. Carleton.

6
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,792
Come on, break it up.

7
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,831
Silence.

8
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,674
You men get on down
to the Registry Office. Go on.

9
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,711
- Move along.
- There'll be another day.

10
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,637
Why don't you go back
where you came from?

11
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,671
You better stay off the street.

12
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,116
You gentlemen will please disperse.

13
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,596
You ought to put them Rebels in jail.
Whistling <i>Dixie.</i> Come on.

14
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,992
They ought to obey the laws
of the Provisional Government.

15
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,676
Here you are.
$850 cash left from your bank draft.

16
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,194
- Thank you.
- I think you'll find that correct.

17
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,799
And now, Captain...

18
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,878
I'd be much obliged
if you'd let me stand you a drink.

19
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,596
Sounds like a fine idea.

20
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,036
Fill them up again, bartender.

21
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,397
Here come a couple of high and mighty
you-all people. Let's have fun.

22
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,158
Good day, Mr. Carleton,
Capt. Saunders.

23
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,269
Whiskey, please.

24
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,709
Gentlemen, as I was saying,
these here Southerners...

25
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,990
they're a strange breed of cat.

26
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,759
Yes, sir, a mighty strange breed of cat.

27
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,558
We whipped them good and proper...

28
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,511
and made them holler "uncle"
loud and clear.

29
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,076
And now they still want to act
like they was as good as us.

30
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,828
Hey, you.

31
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,313
Did you hear what I said?

32
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,194
Yes, indeed, sir. You speak very clearly.
Your voice carries quite a ways.

33
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,355
Stagecoach coming. Bunch of new
pretties coming in for the dance hall.

34
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,152
Come on, let's get the first look.

35
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,317
Reb, new gals coming in.
Don't you even want to take a look?

36
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,080
No, thank you kindly.

37
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,356
See what I told you?
Just a mighty strange breed of cat.

38
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,637
Thank you, Capt. Saunders.

39
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,190
You sure have mellowed down a lot.

40
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,152
A man said that to you in the old days...

41
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,271
we'd have to put this place
back together.

42
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,391
You were smart not to take offence.

43
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,112
I took offence, Sam.

44
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,910
Just like you said, I've mellowed down.

45
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,791
Thanks for the whiskey, Mr. Carleton.
Good day, gentlemen.

46
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,833
Come on!

47
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,674
Where I come from, no gentleman
lets a gal get her store shoes dusty.

48
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,118
Jump, my pretty.

49
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,519
You're on your own.

50
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,079
You're next, baby.

51
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,748
I thought you was one of them there.

52
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,317
Well, you got to get down anyway.
Come on.

53
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,951
You can't talk like that
to a Southern lady.

54
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,638
Now listen, fella...

55
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,599
Allow me, ma'am.

56
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,714
You'd better sit this dance out, miss.

57
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,515
Stand aside.

58
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,279
Stand back, coming through.
What's the trouble here?

59
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,550
This Reb yelled
that somebody insulted a lady.

60
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,830
- Then he started hitting on us.
- Especially me.

61
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,235
- Nobody insulted no lady.
- Quiet.

62
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,433
Arrest this man, sonny.
I'll go along and proffer charges.

63
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,357
Take a good look
at this uniform, mister...

64
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,232
and don't ever again call me "sonny."

65
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,557
Does a Union officer stand there
and permit them to say I am no lady?

66
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,432
Your pardon, ma'am. Silence!

67
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,993
Have these men insulted you, ma'am?

68
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,838
And beat my husband
when he defended me.

69
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,995
Now listen...

70
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,951
Sergeant, if that man persists,
arrest him.

71
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,992
The rest of you will disperse.
Go on, move along.

72
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,314
Thank you.

73
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,791
Perhaps we'd better carry your husband
to the military medical post.

74
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,718
I think not.
If you could bring him to our room.

75
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,156
Room 110.

76
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,350
Of course, ma'am.
Sergeant, take his feet.

77
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,118
You two, take his shoulders. Careful.

78
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,559
Gently, please.

79
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,434
Thank you.

80
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,313
Excuse me, gentlemen.

81
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,111
Is there anything else
we can do, ma'am?

82
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,629
- No, thank you.
- You may go, men.

83
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,475
Lieutenant, I'll take those things.

84
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,468
Thank you.

85
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,629
Capt. Colt Saunders, 14th Cavalry.

86
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,355
You must be very proud
of Capt. Saunders, ma'am.

87
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,118
At the Point, our instructor told us...

88
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,834
the 14th Confederate Cavalry's charge
at Round Mountain...

89
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,679
will go down in history
with Gen. Blücher's cavalry action...

90
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,597
the evening at Waterloo.

91
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,679
Capt. Saunders never spoke very much
of the war.

92
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,634
You must get him to, ma'am.
His 14th Cavalry was an illustrious unit.

93
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,198
- Thank you again, Lieutenant.
- Your servant, ma'am.

94
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,878
Good day, Lieutenant.

95
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,234
- Mrs. Saunders.
- Yes?

96
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,273
Here, let me help you with those boots.
I just wanted to say, ma'am...

97
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,553
that you mustn't judge
the people of the North...

98
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,560
by those scum, those carpetbaggers.

99
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,435
We're not like that at all.

100
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,640
Those cheap politicians
that scurried down here...

101
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,955
to take advantage of the chaos...

102
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,957
Ma'am, what I mean is, we soldiers...

103
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,277
I'm sure no Southerner
would ever misjudge you, Lieutenant...

104
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,839
or your kind.

105
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,759
Your servant, ma'am.

106
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,115
Good day.

107
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,758
- Lieutenant.
- Ma'am?

108
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,430
I don't believe you'll be needing those.

109
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,751
- Good day, ma'am.
- Good day.

110
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,749
Yes, ma'am?

111
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,553
- I'd like to see Miss LaSalle.
- Miss Ruby LaSalle?

112
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,669
Yes.

113
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,429
I'll get her if you'll wait a minute, ma'am.
Will you sit down, please?

114
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,033
Thank you.

115
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,077
I woke up this morning
and my money belt was gone.

116
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,192
So you made moo-moo talk
with one of the entertainers...

117
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,073
and now your head hurts
and your money's gone. What is it?

118
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,873
- There's a lady to see you in the office.
- Who is it?

119
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,833
I don't know.
When I said "lady," I meant it.

120
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,750
- Keep an eye on the drunk, Tod.
- Right.

121
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,194
- Ma'am, you said...
- Yes, I did, didn't I? Matty.

122
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,593
- You wanted to see me?
- Miss LaSalle...

123
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,589
I have a matter to discuss which
may be embarrassing to both of us.

124
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,675
I hesitate to offend but...

125
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,592
You old hag.

126
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,838
You've got your hair too blonde.

127
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,076
It's better
when it's more on the reddish side.

128
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,519
Lorna, you got my letter.

129
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,518
I was afraid you wouldn't
with the way mails are these days.

130
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,632
Honey, it's like I told you:
This town is knee-deep in money.

131
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,830
The carpetbaggers
are stealing a ranch a day.

132
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,555
I'll shut up. You sit down and tell me
everything that's happened to you.

133
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,070
Nothing different ever happens.
Just the same thing over and over.

134
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,558
The little girl from the well-off family
who teaches school...

135
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,671
just to wile away her time.

136
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,754
I may decide to take up teaching again.

137
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,757
Teaching is genteel.

138
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,911
Carefully selected children, of course.

139
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,996
I bet the gentlemen
knock each other down...

140
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,271
to show how polite they can be
to a real dyed-in-the-wool lady.

141
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,836
You did have a different raising
from most of us. School and all.

142
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,948
I often wonder how come you wound up
arm-in-arm with the likes of me.

143
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,192
Hunger's a very powerful motive...

144
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,676
and you're the nicest person
I ever found to be arm-in-arm with.

145
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,638
Speaking of hunger...

146
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,155
I don't expect it in the immediate future.

147
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,358
Here, put these in your safe, will you?
They weigh a ton.

148
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,914
Gold is heavy,
but I'm still very fond of it.

149
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,919
This poor but proud act of yours
must work.

150
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,391
I'll want a room.

151
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,916
I have to lay low for a few days.

152
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,958
The angry gentleman
who formerly owned the $900?

153
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,069
Yes.

154
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,989
Big, wild character named
Colt Saunders. Do you know him?

155
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,353
Colt Saunders?

156
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,398
Where did you leave him?

157
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,636
Sleeping peacefully, I hope.

158
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,750
You listen to me. He'll take this
town apart, not because of the money.

159
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,518
He owns all the land
from here to Texas.

160
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,471
But because the Saunders
are made that way.

161
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,876
He once chased a rustler all the way
into Mexico for 20 scrawny cows...

162
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,436
when he owned thousands. They're
always willing to get killed or kill...

163
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,279
if they think they're right.
They always think they're right.

164
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,278
Don't you see, Lorna?
When he wakes and finds...

165
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,513
Now you listen to me.

166
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,235
I've got a little room way up in the attic.

167
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,318
We're gonna plant you there
until we decide what to do.

168
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,032
I'll make out a receipt.

169
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,437
Make it out to Capt. Colt Saunders.

170
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,108
You're crazy. I'm telling you, you'd
better crawl up in my attic and hide.

171
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,920
No, I want the nicest room in the place.

172
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,477
Just make out the receipt
to Capt. Colt Saunders.

173
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,271
They've got a saying in Texas:

174
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,434
"The Rio Grande changes its course...

175
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,471
"but the Saunders don't."

176
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,756
- Hello.
- You were unconscious.

177
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,791
That fight was a little fast
for introductions.

178
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,913
- I'm Colt Saunders.
- Miss Lorna Hunter.

179
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,435
Well, now that you're all right...

180
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,597
- My head's spinning.
- Oh, dear.

181
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,952
I always wanted to see what women
carried in one of these knapsacks.

182
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,673
You savage!

183
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,274
You brute!

184
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,679
Quiet down now.

185
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,678
I don't mind giving you a share,
but not all.

186
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,351
- Let me go, you...
- Savage? Brute?

187
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,273
Sodbuster!

188
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,909
All right, angel, where's the money?

189
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,915
Are you going to give it to me,
or do I have to shake it out of you?

190
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,637
You see, $900 is just much too much...

191
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,194
for services so far rendered.

192
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,955
Well, sir, you up and healthy already.

193
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,230
- Yes, sir, I see you healthy.
- You, girl.

194
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,432
Bring me the coldest bottle of wine
in the saloon. The best, hear?

195
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,788
Yes, sir.

196
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,229
- Shall I fetch you a comb, ma'am?
- No.

197
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,715
- Now, let's be civilised about this.
- Civilised?

198
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,479
Return that wallet. Then we'll have
a cool glass of wine...

199
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,272
and talk things over.

200
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,511
I finally begin to see...

201
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,518
the reason for your
insane conduct, Captain.

202
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,072
You believe I have stolen
some money from you.

203
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,636
Let's not say "stolen." A wallet
with $900 gold has been misplaced.

204
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,514
- When you remember where it is...
- Captain, look on the table.

205
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,389
I thought your money might be safer
in the vault downstairs.

206
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,439
Miss Hunter, I don't know how to begin...

207
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,314
Yes, sir, Captain. Thank you.

208
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,873
Who's in my room?

209
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,798
Nobody, ma'am, honest.
The Captain ain't in there.

210
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,151
I suppose I can assume
the same servants...

211
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,952
who were bribed to provide this...

212
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,196
were also bribed to ignore this.

213
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,994
Miss Hunter, Gen. Robert E. Lee
signed a formal statement...

214
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,839
to the effect that I was an officer
and a gentleman.

215
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,155
Now, please have dinner
with me tonight.

216
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,238
Give me a chance to prove
he wasn't guilty of false statements...

217
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,396
when he signed my commission.

218
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,753
It seems to me you go rather far afield
to involve the General.

219
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,071
I anticipated you would appear again...

220
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,555
after your outrageous behaviour
this afternoon.

221
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,240
I have a few things to explain to you.

222
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,032
- Over a glass of wine.
- No, l...

223
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,309
Fine.

224
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,473
- Aren't you forgetting your bribe?
- Special signal.

225
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,192
Dinner in 10 minutes.

226
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,270
You may not wish to have dinner
with me, Captain, after I've had my say.

227
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,719
I'll chance that.

228
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,429
Thank you.

229
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,318
First, I'd better prepare you.

230
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,036
You see, I'm an emancipated woman.

231
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,559
- Indeed.
- Yes.

232
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,872
I was fortunate in attending schools...

233
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,551
with progressive ideas.

234
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,758
- I may shock you.
- I'll be on my guard.

235
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,718
I'm husband hunting
and have eliminated you as a candidate.

236
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,951
As a candidate for what?

237
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,799
For marriage.

238
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,711
I have considered everything
and have crossed you off my list.

239
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,798
Crossed? I didn't even know
I was on any list.

240
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,400
Tell me, how could you eliminate me
as a candidate...

241
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,476
when you don't know
anything about me?

242
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,717
On the contrary.
You brawl in the streets.

243
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,553
You're used to awakening
under such circumstances...

244
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,150
that your money might have been taken
by a female person.

245
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,669
Frankly, you do not qualify, Captain.

246
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,549
So please don't try to continue
our acquaintance beyond this evening.

247
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,274
It's plain we are not suited
to each other.

248
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,999
Good night, Captain.

249
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,312
And thank you for the wine.
It was delicious.

250
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,352
Now see here, honey...

251
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,439
I might've guessed you called women
"honey" on short acquaintance.

252
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,956
- Miss Hunter...
- Good night, Captain.

253
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,318
You've got marriage all figured out...

254
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,029
like ledgers in a set of business books,
haven't you?

255
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,754
You left out the main ingredient: Love.

256
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,954
Oh, no. I intend to show my husband
great affection.

257
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,197
- Affection and respect?
- Of course.

258
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,389
I predict this man will spend
a great deal of time away from home.

259
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,433
No, he won't.

260
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,559
I've by no means
left love out of my calculations.

261
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,277
Love comes in time...

262
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,472
with understanding and respect.

263
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,311
I don't see how anyone can look so right
and think so wrong.

264
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,318
- I don't understand.
- About me.

265
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,351
I don't waste time brawling in the street.
I've got no time to waste.

266
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,153
I just spent the last four years
losing a war.

267
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,517
I've got a ranch to build up
and a family to raise.

268
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,915
I'm looking for a woman who...

269
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,269
A wife.

270
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,913
You're looking for a husband. Wait now.

271
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,992
Miss Hunter,
do you want to get married?

272
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,193
Of all the cold-blooded, unromantic...

273
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,317
Not the least bit
like double entry bookkeeping, is it?

274
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,795
No.

275
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,229
- I'll be back.
- No, serve it.

276
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,716
- Come back later.
- Yes, sir.

277
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,634
No, stay. Captain.

278
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,759
- But the dinner, sir. What'll I do?
- Eat it.

279
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,669
Captain.

280
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,120
I don't know. I just don't know.

281
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,194
- Come on, don't fall.
- Wait a minute.

282
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,314
Ruby, where can I find a minister?

283
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,199
Four doors down.

284
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,515
- Come on, we gotta get married.
- No.

285
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,519
- You don't want get married? You told...
- Oh, yes.

286
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,996
- I want to get married.
- You don't want to marry me, is that it?

287
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,149
No. I mean, yes, I want to marry you.

288
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,557
But not like this, Colt.

289
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,672
I want a white gown, and a veil,
and flowers...

290
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,199
and all the things to remember.

291
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,993
I know. I do know, but...

292
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,789
I've been away from Bar S for five years.
I want to go home.

293
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,630
I'm hungry to see my land again.

294
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,511
So if you could pass up the trimmings,
I'd be grateful.

295
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,194
All right.

296
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,919
You wait right here.

297
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,478
Miss Hunter...

298
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,631
- Ruby, I don't know your last name.
- LaSalle.

299
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,393
How do you do?

300
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,473
Miss Hunter.

301
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,757
Wait for me? Here?

302
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,590
I see what you mean
about these Saunders being violent.

303
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,153
He just...

304
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,797
Ruby, did you hear?
He's going to marry me. Me!

305
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,553
Did you hear?

306
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,159
- Expect me to spout congratulations?
- Why not?

307
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,590
- I expect you to be happy for me.
- Happy that you're riding for a fall?

308
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,315
It's a lot of nonsense.
It's a dream, honey. It never happens.

309
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,712
Because men who aren't afraid of guns,
Indians, or rattlesnakes...

310
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,990
are afraid of a little laughter
behind their back.

311
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,192
And there'll always be some man
with a weak mind and long memory...

312
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,118
who'll remember a girl who worked
at Selma's in Baton Rouge...

313
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,389
or Tess' in Frisco.

314
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,399
And when your man hears that laughter,
you'll wish you were long dead.

315
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,431
I'm telling you, Lorna, hide.

316
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,748
Sneak out of town, anything,
because that's just not gonna work.

317
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,435
I've got to believe it'll work.

318
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,433
I've got to.

319
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,270
I'll be here, honey, when you come
crawling back with your heart broken...

320
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,790
because your noble Captain
found out he made a bad bargain.

321
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,350
It won't be a bad bargain for him.

322
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,234
I've seen the other side of the street.
I'm going to be very hard to discourage.

323
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,194
Every day I'm going see to it
that he's made a very good bargain.

324
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,833
The minister's getting into his clothes.

325
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,474
Let me be the first to congratulate you.

326
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,310
If I knew how to pray, I would.

327
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,191
The mountains are very beautiful.

328
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,790
There are steep valleys in there
that take your breath away.

329
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,152
Places where it seems like if you knew
the right words, you could talk to God.

330
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,029
- That's a fool thing to say.
- No.

331
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,638
- You love the hills.
- Well, I know them.

332
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,638
I should. I once walked
clear through those. It took me 24 days.

333
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,752
- Were you lost?
- No.

334
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,189
My granddaddy,
he raised me, you know.

335
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,716
My mother and father were killed
in the Apache uprising of '39.

336
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,069
When I was 15, the old man and I
rode clean up to Mesa Grande.

337
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,510
That's nine days on good horses.

338
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,553
He gave me a rifle, 30 cartridges,
a sack of salt, and rode off...

339
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,716
leading my horse behind him.

340
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,878
I learned those hills
by walking home through them.

341
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,719
You mean he just turned you loose
in the wilderness?

342
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,276
- It's a wonder you didn't starve.
- I had a rifle, remember?

343
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,554
What's that?

344
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,230
Just Mr. Bass trying to get loose.

345
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,669
- Colt, let him go.
- Let him...

346
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,349
Please.

347
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,634
All right.

348
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,391
He's already down in his hole
telling Mama how he outsmarted us.

349
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,476
Let him. I'm glad.

350
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,392
- Why did you want that?
- I don't know.

351
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,837
- Bar S.
- It looks like an emerald.

352
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,077
That's what my grandma named it the
first time she saw it, right from this hill.

353
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,038
<i>La esmeralda.</i>
That means "emerald" in Spanish.

354
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,797
Of course, no one ever called it that.

355
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,390
It got to be known as Bar Stubborn,
after my granddaddy.

356
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,515
- Colt, <i>hombre. Gracias a Dios.</i>
- Inocencio.

357
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,119
Thank God you are back.

358
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,752
Five years you have been away.

359
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,348
- It's a long time.
- Hey, <i>vaquero.</i>

360
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,752
Mrs. Colt Saunders.

361
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,112
Lorna, my oldest friend,
the <i>gran vaquero</i> of the Bar S...

362
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,800
- Inocencio Antonio Ortega.
- How do you do?

363
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,039
Welcome, <i>senora,</i>
and much happiness.

364
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,914
Thank you.

365
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,759
There, now. You stand right there
or you'll fall over something.

366
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,471
I think I can still
find my way around in here.

367
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,515
There.

368
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,673
The place looks worse
than I figured it would.

369
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,633
That Inocencio
never was much of a housekeeper.

370
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,318
Don't apologise. It'll be fine.

371
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,312
That's Grandmother and Granddad.
A family thing.

372
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,516
One time or another, all the Saunders
get their pictures painted.

373
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,673
This is the chair.

374
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,708
Once we get straightened up around
here and start sending for furniture...

375
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,149
you can throw this out
and get some kind of a chair...

376
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,759
I should say not!

377
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,759
When our portraits are painted, I'm
going to be sitting in this same chair.

378
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,755
<i>Senora...</i>

379
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,676
we have a saying in Spanish...

380
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,951
that a glad heart
is all that one should ask of God...

381
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,151
for that is real happiness.

382
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,912
My heart is glad.

383
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,155
You, too, have a glad heart.

384
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,470
- It shines in your eyes.
- Does it show so much?

385
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,993
The glow of true beauty
in a woman's face...

386
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,200
is kindled only by first love.

387
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,153
First love.

388
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,150
It's true. I've never been in love before.

389
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,636
Have you been here
a long time, Inocencio?

390
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,988
A long time?

391
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,348
I was born here. My father used to ride
with him every day.

392
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,035
Will you help me
not to make too many mistakes?

393
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,593
Sure, <i>senora.</i>

394
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,278
- I will help you in every way I can.
- Thank you.

395
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,079
<i>Amigo...</i>

396
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,796
couldn't anybody find a broom
all the time I was gone?

397
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,629
That bedroom looks like
a family of pack rats wintered in there.

398
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,034
The times were bad, <i>hombre.</i>

399
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,515
There was much to do,
few hands to do it with.

400
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,916
Maybe tomorrow
you can send a rider to Tres Rios...

401
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,556
and get a woman to do the housework.
Maybe you can get Maria back.

402
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,875
- Sure, I get her.
- <i>Bueno.</i>

403
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,669
- Good night, <i>senora.</i>
- Good night, Inocencio.

404
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,831
Years of dust, I'm afraid.

405
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,389
That's a strange expression
you're wearing.

406
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,118
- The mess, I suppose.
- No.

407
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,079
It's a feeling.

408
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,757
As if for the first time in my life,
I felt I belonged.

409
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,709
North, south, east, and west.

410
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,395
You look around just like your
grandfather used to do every morning.

411
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,193
Why not?
A rancher lives by the weather.

412
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,195
Every morning, the sky tells his fortune.

413
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,393
Light clouds over the Sierra Diablo.
Rains should come early this year.

414
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,514
We don't have to worry about the grass.

415
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,720
But the animals, no good.

416
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,830
I don't like to hand you this.

417
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,552
Since I wrote you, the <i>politicos</i>
have come twice searching.

418
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,240
They didn't find the herd of horses
hidden in the hills.

419
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,349
Cattle?

420
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,789
I kept them scattered
as much as possible.

421
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,794
But they found most of them
and took them.

422
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,478
As bad as that?

423
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,432
But more important, Colt...

424
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,677
last night I took the responsibility
of not telling you something.

425
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,268
A man should not be told bad news
on his first night...

426
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,312
with his bride under his family rooftree...

427
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,712
but your brother is here.

428
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,879
Cinch came home?

429
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,595
Is the Bar S Ranch home to Cinch?

430
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,829
I don't know.

431
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,635
But whether it is his home or not,
he rode in here two months ago.

432
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,675
You haven't changed in five years.

433
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,119
Neither have you.

434
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,199
On the contrary, I have learned humility.

435
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,557
Learned it in New Orleans.

436
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,911
In New Orleans, my money ran out.

437
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,157
You started out
with enough to last you quite a while.

438
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,554
I hurried.

439
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,753
You must be going to make a point
about that.

440
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,917
There's nothing in writing
that says I own any part of Bar S.

441
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,712
Grandpa saw to it that the will said...

442
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,479
I could only have
what you saw fit for me to have.

443
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,354
Grandpa had such a high opinion
of your moral stature.

444
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,115
You figure I'm entitled to a share?

445
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,479
Of course I do.

446
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,879
It's a pleasure to do business
with a man of character.

447
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,150
Better than having a contract.

448
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,913
I'd like my share now,
if you could manage it.

449
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,439
Gold preferably.

450
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,550
You've been around a couple of months.
You know the shape the ranch is in.

451
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,398
You could sell. There are buyers.

452
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,795
Each one with a carpetbag
full of Yankee money.

453
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,990
And you know I won't do that.

454
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,473
I had that figured out.

455
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,513
Especially after Inocencio told me
about a woman you brought with you.

456
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,633
I brought a wife.

457
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,760
My use of words wasn't meant to offend.

458
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,399
When do I meet her?

459
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,513
I've got to go over some tally books
with Inocencio. I'll introduce you then.

460
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,789
Fine.

461
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,914
What did you tell your bride about me?

462
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,751
I forgot to mention you.

463
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,194
That was real thoughtful forgetting.

464
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,715
Uncomfortable position, isn't it?

465
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:20,198
Even sitting down, Grandma looked like
an arrow about to fly from the bow.

466
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,072
She always sat just like that...

467
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,636
before she came with
the speed of lightning to box my ears.

468
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,957
I'm Beauregard Saunders. Everybody
calls me Cinch. Colt's brother.

469
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,993
Colt's brother?

470
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,395
I didn't know he had any family left.

471
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,750
He told me
he'd forgotten to mention me.

472
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,152
I'm the skeleton in the Saunders' closet,
you see.

473
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,190
Nobody ever expected me to return.

474
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,231
When I left, I announced
in ringing tones...

475
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,874
that wild horses couldn't drag me back.

476
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,753
- Here, let me help you.
- Do me a favour.

477
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,468
Don't ever help me do anything
you wouldn't help a two-armed man do.

478
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,319
I'm sorry.

479
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,755
- Do me another favour?
- I'll try.

480
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,111
Don't ask me what battle of the war
I lost my arm in.

481
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,038
The question makes the hairs stand up
on the back of my neck.

482
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,752
All right, I won't.

483
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,839
Sorry. I almost offered you a drink.

484
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,954
Cinch, pour me a drink.

485
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,797
Right down without a gasp.

486
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,075
- Why'd you do that?
- I don't know.

487
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,553
Yes, I do know.

488
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,793
You sounded as if
you were talking down to me.

489
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,514
- And you can't stand that?
- Failing I have.

490
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,715
I did a favour for you, remember?

491
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,030
- Will you do one for me?
- Sure.

492
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,992
Tell me how you got to be
the skeleton in the closet.

493
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,356
I believe the world is round.

494
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,996
- No!
- You mustn't laugh.

495
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,510
Such new-fangled ideas
haven't been accepted at Bar S yet.

496
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,116
You know, you have very good manners.
I have the sure test.

497
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,714
What's that?

498
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,359
Bad-mannered people just blurt it out,
"How'd you lose your arm?"

499
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,234
Well-mannered people burn up
with curiosity, but don't ask.

500
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,718
I am curious.
How did you lose your arm?

501
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,593
Ask Colt.

502
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,517
I stopped by the bunkhouse for you,
but you'd gone.

503
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,229
I see you've already
introduced yourselves.

504
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,830
- Yes, we did.
- And drank a toast to the wedding.

505
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,913
- You married above you, Colt.
- I surely did.

506
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,755
Darling, I've got to pay a call
on a ranch nearby.

507
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,314
I hate to ask you to travel
the minute you get here...

508
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,874
but it'll give you a chance
to see something of Bar S.

509
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,479
- All right?
- Of course, dear.

510
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,831
- Just pack enough for overnight.
- Going to Uncle Hoyt's?

511
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,034
More relatives I haven't heard about?

512
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,517
No, Cinch is all there is.

513
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,595
Vance Hoyt. We've called him uncle
since we were children.

514
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,393
Since Granddad died, Uncle Hoyt's
been unofficial advisor to half of Texas.

515
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,317
He'll advise you to fight.

516
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,239
We'll leave just as soon as you're ready.

517
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,514
Look, play down that talk about fighting,
will you?

518
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,039
I don't want to scare Lorna.

519
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,469
It's my guess we'll both be white
around the gills...

520
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,477
before Lorna's frightened.

521
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,640
You can't be fool enough to think
a few armed ranchers...

522
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,115
can hold off the United States Army.

523
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,549
Catch up a couple of horses
for the buckboard, will you, Cinch?

524
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,508
We can take this one.
I just started to unpack it.

525
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,791
What did you think of him?

526
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,308
I like him.

527
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,071
Of course, I was surprised...

528
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,076
- and a little frightened.
- Frightened?

529
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,592
Colt, what's wrong?
Why didn't you tell me about him?

530
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,438
I should have told you.

531
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,792
I didn't expect he'd...

532
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,717
I should have told you.

533
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,110
We were just kids when it happened.

534
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,556
Just kids horsing around
on the windmill platform...

535
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,277
out on the south range.

536
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,876
Cinch got his arm caught
in the gears of the windmill.

537
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,790
I had to amputate his arm...

538
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,118
and carry him back.

539
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,470
People made quite a fuss about it,
as if I'd been a hero.

540
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,273
How terrible, for both of you.

541
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,358
You know, you're the first person
who ever realised I got hurt that day.

542
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,150
You've got an instinct
that makes you understand.

543
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,152
That's very important.

544
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,317
- <i>Senor</i> Colt.
- Let me hold it, <i>senor.</i>

545
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,874
- Our hearts are happy, <i>senor.</i>
- <i>Gracias.</i>

546
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,236
I took the long way around.
I wanted you to see the horse herd.

547
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,310
Colt, look at that little one.

548
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,679
It's a nice-looking filly, sired by that
flax-manned stallion over there.

549
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,472
She's got his markings.

550
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,756
- Could I go closer?
- No.

551
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,834
The mare would start for the hills.
They're skittish around anyone on foot.

552
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,873
Besides, I don't think she's ever seen
an outfit like that before.

553
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,194
- He's a stubborn little fellow.
- Beautiful filly, huh?

554
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,711
She's darling. All legs.

555
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,312
I'll take this off
and let her go to her mama.

556
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,478
<i>Senora,</i> may I present my five sons?

557
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,431
Luis, Asuncion, Rafael,
Pedro, and Juan.

558
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,079
How do you do?

559
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,033
They have prepared
a little speech of welcome for you.

560
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,595
Address the <i>senora</i>
the way you were instructed.

561
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,159
<i>Senora,</i> welcome to the Bar S.

562
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,319
- Papa, I forget.
- You forget?

563
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,595
You donkey's head. You shame
your father. You behave like a peasant.

564
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,110
Where are your manners, <i>muchacho?</i>
And after all I taught you.

565
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,035
Now you pay attention. Watch.

566
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,392
I do it again for you.

567
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,916
Most gracious lady,
now that you have come here...

568
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,479
the sun will break every morning across
the verdant slopes of the cordilleras.

569
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,950
The grass will grow greener.

570
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,994
The golden grain will tassel earlier.

571
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,870
And the rising moon will paint
the mountains with more silver...

572
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,117
because of your presence here.
And so, <i>senora...</i>

573
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,590
welcome to the Bar S Ranch...

574
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,072
and to a place in our hearts.

575
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,353
Thank you. Thank you, all of you.

576
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,472
All right, <i>muchachos,</i> now go to work.

577
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,154
Goodbye.

578
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,794
It's not much of a place to look at,
but Uncle Hoyt's quite a man.

579
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,350
- Where's Vance?
- Who?

580
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,119
Vance Hoyt.

581
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,550
He ain't here. Who are you?

582
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,312
- I'm Colt Saunders.
- Yes, of the Bar S.

583
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,231
Back from the war at last?

584
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,635
- Are you Mrs. Saunders?
- Yes.

585
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,437
I'm Deputy Commissioner Cable.

586
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,109
When a gentleman's introduced
to my wife...

587
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,835
even when the gentleman
does his own introducing, he stands up.

588
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,517
Beg your pardon, Mrs. Saunders.

589
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,319
Out here in the hills,
we sometimes forget our manners.

590
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:54,035
One thing about Texas, there'll always
be someone around to remind you.

591
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,513
Commissioner Harrison.

592
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,272
Commissioner, Capt.
And Mrs. Saunders of the Bar S.

593
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,709
Mrs. Saunders.
Won't you sit down, please?

594
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,118
No, thank you.

595
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,196
- Captain, I'm glad you're back.
- Commissioner.

596
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,517
There are some things we've been
hard put to delay until your return.

597
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,393
- Where's Vance Hoyt?
- I don't know.

598
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,951
To be blunt about it, Mr. Hoyt took
the most irrational attitude...

599
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,709
about a tax law that was levied on him
by the Provisional Government.

600
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,428
Mr. Cable, could I have
one of those pamphlets, please?

601
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,152
We were forced to order a writ served.

602
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,953
Hoyt disappeared,
a most annoying situation.

603
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,709
It's not like Uncle Hoyt to disappear
because of a legal paper.

604
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,670
- He was your uncle? I didn't know...
- No, everybody called him that.

605
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,794
Let's hope everything works out fine.

606
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,790
Captain, as to your personal matters
as regard to our Commission...

607
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,151
I've been dealing with your foreman
and your brother, who is...

608
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,188
let's say, a most outspoken young man.

609
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,031
Now that you're back,
I think everything will work out better.

610
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,230
Work out better about what?

611
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,149
Captain...

612
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,991
I suggest you read this carefully.

613
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,759
It's the Tax Act of
the Provisional Government of Texas...

614
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,871
of which I am District Commissioner.

615
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,198
As a soldier, you know that wars
are expensive and must be paid for.

616
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,948
But please don't take the attitude
of so many Texans...

617
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,196
that we're land-grabbers. We're not.

618
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,398
We simply have to carry out
the orders given us.

619
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,156
Now, if you and Mrs. Saunders
will share our hospitality...

620
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,590
I think it's about time for supper.

621
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,392
No, thanks, Commissioner.

622
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,716
- Good day.
- Good day.

623
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,436
That's Uncle Hoyt's buffalo gun.

624
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,953
He claimed this gun settled Texas
and many a Comanche.

625
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,278
Always said he wanted me to have it
after he was gone.

626
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,118
Might as well let him have the old thing
if he wants it.

627
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,435
It ain't much good to anybody anymore.

628
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,989
Thanks.

629
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,073
Captain, Mrs. Saunders.

630
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,633
Captain.

631
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,635
Will you wait in the buckboard, Lorna?

632
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,199
Hard to believe,
way out here in the wilderness.

633
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,992
You have the advantage of me, sir.

634
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,032
I'm sorry, but I could have sworn...

635
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,192
I'm really exceeding my authority
in showing you this...

636
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,356
but take it as a gesture of friendship.

637
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:05,598
It's the assessment upon which
your next tax payment is based.

638
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,194
I realise the amount is absurd
and unrealistic...

639
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,312
but I'm merely the servant
of the Provisional Government.

640
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,839
$16,000?

641
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,271
As I said, I am aware
that the amount is unrealistic.

642
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,274
You've already taken the Bar S cattle.

643
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,279
As I also said, I am merely the servant
of the Provisional Government.

644
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,993
I guess I can expect to see you,
Commissioner.

645
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,994
You can.

646
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,436
You sure took your time
getting back from Austin.

647
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,632
- Hello, Cable.
- You got a girl over there, I reckon?

648
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,355
Well, I came without killing no horses,
if that's what you mean.

649
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:27,075
- Say, who was that in the buckboard?
- Capt. And Mrs. Saunders.

650
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,118
Flower of the old South, chivalry.

651
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,271
Saunders of Bar S?

652
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,468
Man, I almost made
the mistake of the century.

653
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,113
I mistook Mrs. Saunders for a gal...

654
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,515
I used skip around with
back in St. Louis.

655
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,473
One of Ruby LaSalle's gals,
Lorna Hunter.

656
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,750
- Man, what a mistake.
- Lorna? That's no mistake, man.

657
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,235
I just heard him call her Lorna.

658
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,032
I wonder if he knows.

659
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:00,476
I bet he doesn't. Of course not.
Old high-and-mighty Southern gent.

660
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,912
I'd love to tell him.

661
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,952
I'd like to see the look on his face
when he finds out.

662
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,236
Tired horses, ready rifles...

663
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,193
men talking together
where women cannot hear.

664
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,909
This is a hard country for the women.

665
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,877
- Here's a fresh cup of coffee, <i>senora.</i>
- No more, thank you.

666
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,228
If you don't need me...

667
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,715
Nothing else. Thanks, Maria.
You may go.

668
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,149
- <i>Buenas noches, senora.</i>
- Good night, Maria.

669
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,154
Thank you.

670
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,231
What came out of the meeting?

671
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,388
I wonder if it's heredity or environment.

672
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,909
Do only stubborn men come to Texas?

673
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,158
Or does the Texas air
make all men stubborn?

674
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,712
They voted to fight.

675
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,232
Take that off, too.

676
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,710
- I'll get another cup.
- Fine.

677
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,231
You'd better have a touch of this.

678
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,515
Thanks.

679
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,271
You know, the fact that
men die heroes...

680
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,517
doesn't change the fact that
they're dead before their time.

681
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,392
Every man in the room knew the odds.

682
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,273
And they gave the only answer
a Texan knows.

683
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,917
But not one of them stopped to think
that they had a family at home.

684
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,355
Perhaps they had a right
to a part of the decision.

685
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,675
And you're as bad. How about Lorna?

686
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,589
Don't you think there's
a woman's viewpoint to be considered?

687
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,793
I guess I am the only one here
qualified to give the woman's viewpoint.

688
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,398
I'm tired of being talked over
and around.

689
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,158
It's only right, Lorna.

690
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,393
Wait, let me.

691
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:27,077
And don't hesitate to contradict me
if I make it one shade blacker than it is.

692
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,156
These carpetbag crooks...

693
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,795
intend to grab every big ranch
in this part of Texas, and they will...

694
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,753
if the Provisional Government
stays in power long enough.

695
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,916
One alternative is to fight them...

696
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,112
and hope that an honest government
will come to power in Austin...

697
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,117
in time to save the ranchers.

698
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,789
Colt will admit that this is one chance
in a hundred. Right, Colt?

699
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,838
Worse than that.
One in two hundred, say.

700
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,910
The other alternative is to cut and run.

701
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,110
There's a few cattle left,
but more important...

702
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,231
there's 300 head of horses
hidden in the hills.

703
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:01,955
Horses will bring in their weight in gold
at the Union Army Depot in Sedalia.

704
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:06,119
We could drive them there and face the
world with full pockets and no worries.

705
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,232
And let them take Bar S?

706
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:12,594
What's Bar S?
Some hills and creeks and valleys.

707
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,392
Could be duplicated in California...

708
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,795
Mexico, or someplace else.
That's Bar S.

709
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,153
Colt, was it fairly stated?

710
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,993
Yeah, fair enough.

711
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,795
I think you should decide, Lorna.

712
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,953
First, I want to try
and explain something...

713
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,036
I don't really understand myself.

714
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,192
In the war,
my regiment fought its first action...

715
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,311
on the banks of the Potomac River.

716
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,357
Four years later,
we were still fighting on a riverbank...

717
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,357
800 miles south.

718
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,671
I just can't retreat anymore.

719
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,870
For once in your life
use some common sense.

720
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,356
There's nothing in the Bar S background
that means anything to Lorna.

721
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,074
She's entitled to go away
and start a new life...

722
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,590
to start her own traditions
along with her own family.

723
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,200
That's very understanding of you, Cinch.

724
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,631
But something tells me
if I decided we should go away...

725
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,958
the man who went with me would be
a different man than the man I married.

726
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,430
And that frightens me
more than carpetbaggers' scheming.

727
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,989
You're too good for any Saunders.

728
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,513
Good night.

729
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,117
You sit that horse
more like a Texas girl every day.

730
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,149
Thank you, Inocencio.
Tomorrow I'll really race you, honey.

731
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:56,072
Dust of many riders
along the Mesa Verde.

732
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,590
Let's put the horses away.

733
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,272
I got a loose girth.

734
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,598
What are you sweating for?
It ain't a hot day.

735
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,749
- I ain't as sure as you that this will work.
- Of course it will work.

736
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,270
You insult Saunders' wife,
he draws on you, and I kill him.

737
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,072
- I don't know.
- You don't have to know nothing.

738
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,152
Saunders is trying to get these ranchers
to make a fight.

739
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,872
We can't have that.

740
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,999
Don't worry, I'll be in action
before his gun ever clears leather.

741
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,237
We ain't gonna let you get killed,
are we, Mr. Commissioner?

742
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,591
Look at him.
Sweating, and on a day like this.

743
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,316
- Capt. Saunders.
- Social visit, Commissioner?

744
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,431
In a way, Captain. You might call it that.

745
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,757
You always take a cavalry patrol
when you go calling?

746
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,830
Sergeant, you can have your men
water their horses down at the windmill.

747
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,997
- Throw them some hay from that stack.
- Thank you, sir.

748
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:44,509
Sergeant, instruct your men
not to cross that creek to the east.

749
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,632
It's a rule I've made.

750
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:52,872
Captain, our purpose in coming here
was to cross your place...

751
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,515
to see if there were any taxable assets
that we hadn't examined...

752
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,991
like a large herd of horses.

753
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,629
If you leave
once you've watered your stock...

754
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,513
you can get back across
before dark, Commissioner.

755
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:08,838
Captain, if you don't want us
on the Bar S, we won't force the issue.

756
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,111
We'll ask for a court order.

757
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,879
This Commission always operates
with complete legality.

758
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,231
That's why I brought the Army,
to see to the legality.

759
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,233
Mrs. Saunders.
May I pay my respects, ma'am?

760
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,797
Good day, Mr. Harrison.

761
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,672
Just a minute, Captain.

762
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,392
- Mr. Massey.
- Yes, sir?

763
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,476
Come here a minute, please.

764
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,554
I don't believe you've met
my administrative assistant.

765
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,511
- Mr. Massey, Capt. Saunders.
- Sir.

766
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,393
- I'm mighty happy to meet you, Captain.
- And Mrs. Saunders.

767
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,114
- May I present Mr. Massey?
- How do you do?

768
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:50,154
Mrs. Saunders and me already met,
back in St. Louis.

769
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:54,434
- You remember, Lorna.
- No, I don't remember.

770
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,429
But, Lorna, you can't have forgotten.

771
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:02,036
- I'm sorry. I've never seen you before.
- But...

772
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,596
Mrs. Saunders has twice said
she does not know you, sir.

773
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,517
Do not press the point.

774
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,956
Lorna, you gotta remember me.

775
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,676
There was us fellows, you know,
on Gen. Butler's staff.

776
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,039
And you and Floss and the rest...

777
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,596
from Ruby LaSalle's place.

778
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,193
- Watch the red-headed man.
- Put that gun away.

779
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,356
I aim to see that
everything is lawful-like.

780
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,118
In time, Sergeant.

781
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,638
<i>Amigo,</i> speak to them.

782
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,356
I had the one with the red hair
ready for the buzzards.

783
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:01,636
During my discussion with Mr. Massey,
no one is to interfere.

784
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:07,588
And regardless of the outcome,
none of you will shoot Mr. Massey.

785
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,311
Now then, Mr. Massey...

786
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,353
you will go on with
what you were saying.

787
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,599
Colt, stop it.

788
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,191
I was mistaken, Mr. Massey.

789
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,872
I do remember you.

790
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:10,468
You were one of the rear echelon
heroes who hid on Gen. Butler's staff...

791
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,478
while better men
were getting killed in battle.

792
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,232
Good day, gentlemen.

793
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,317
Don't ever let me find you
south of Mesa Verde.

794
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,712
Pick up your hat.

795
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,072
That poor, trembling,
squeaky-voiced little coward.

796
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:48,512
Did you see his eyes?
His eyes were almost crossed with fear.

797
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,632
I just couldn't stand there
and see him killed.

798
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,594
I guess I'll have to kill him sometime.

799
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:02,031
But why?
What's the sense of killing him?

800
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,392
What's the point?

801
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,516
In a way, I'm glad.
I'm glad it's out in the open.

802
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,359
I'll be rounding up strays
for a few weeks.

803
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:17,511
There's a stage leaving Mesa
around the first. Cinch will put you on it.

804
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:28,116
I'd go down on my knees
if I thought it would help.

805
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,279
It won't.

806
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,670
Because everything depends...

807
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,118
on how you look at me now.

808
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,313
Look at me!

809
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,351
For services rendered.

810
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:21,751
The man that threw the first stone
is galloping off to the hills...

811
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:26,112
wearing garments of righteous wrath
and breathing out sanctimonious fire.

812
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,316
- I'm being biblical.
- Don't.

813
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:38,398
Not a lot of money.
Not in the grand manner at all.

814
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,753
In two days' time,
I could rustle up a dozen horse herders.

815
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,633
In nine days, we could have
the horse herd at Sedalia.

816
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,194
That would be a lot of money, Lorna.

817
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,633
If you wanna be unnecessarily
reasonable about the matter...

818
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,230
we do have a claim of sorts
on the assets of Bar S.

819
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:11,232
<i>I'd give the world for</i>

820
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:16,112
<i>One tender moment</i>

821
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:20,950
<i>Un momento</i>

822
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:25,435
<i>Back in your arms</i>

823
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,469
You sing very beautiful, Asuncion.

824
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,437
Luis, it is your turn
to night herd the strays.

825
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:47,510
Captain, it would delight me
if I might ride the stud...

826
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:48,789
with the flax mane and tail.

827
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:52,230
- Sure.
- I would like to ride him to Tres Rios.

828
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,240
The mouth of Lupe would fall open
at the sight.

829
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,713
You go to Tres Rios?

830
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,513
Donkey head,
Lupe's papa would kill you.

831
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,710
Lupe's mama would kill you.

832
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:07,112
Casanova, Lupe's brothers
would kill you.

833
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:11,233
- Lupe's lover would kill you.
- Lupe's husband would kill you.

834
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:15,075
Do you look the ridiculous one,
fleeing from Tres Rios.

835
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,670
Perhaps I appeared ridiculous.
I was in love.

836
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,632
Or I thought I was in love.

837
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:24,070
- The big lover.
- He was in love.

838
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,638
Leave the little one alone.

839
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:35,079
If you think you're in love,
it's the same thing as to be in love.

840
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,399
- No, Papa?
- No, it's not the same.

841
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,553
If you were really in love...

842
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,592
this would be to the other
as gold to lead...

843
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,030
as fine wine to muddy water...

844
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,073
as mountain air to the stench of stables.

845
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,430
When true love comes,
a man has more strength.

846
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,790
His eyes are clearer
and he can see farther away.

847
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,150
And instead of time passing fast...

848
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,038
it stands still.

849
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:05,035
That, <i>muchachos,</i>
is a moment of ecstasy.

850
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,390
That is true love.

851
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:26,158
All right, <i>muchachos,</i>
we are through hunting horses.

852
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,714
Now we saddle up and ride home.

853
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:53,793
Both gone.

854
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,313
Maria told me.

855
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:00,591
Two days ago.
With the horses and many riders.

856
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:10,272
That south wind always brings
the smell of the sage.

857
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,513
It smells good.

858
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,990
She carries your child with her.

859
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:25,314
My...

860
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,151
We'll need fresh horses.

861
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:33,750
Is it not better to wait for the first light
of the sun and kill them all from here?

862
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,872
Why take a chance?

863
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,793
After all,
they're nothing but horse thieves.

864
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,992
Only two horse thieves.

865
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:47,076
The rest are just out-of-work waddies
Cinch picked up.

866
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:52,998
- We wouldn't wanna kill them.
- No, not unless we have to.

867
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,429
We won't. It'll work.
We'll wait till the crack of dawn...

868
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,836
when they're still getting the sleep
out of their eyes and saddling up.

869
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:04,633
Then we move in
and pick up the night herders.

870
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:07,149
Right now,
we'd better get some sleep ourselves.

871
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:11,114
Asuncion, you take the first watch?
Wake me in an hour.

872
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,597
- Could I have another cup of coffee?
- Yes, ma'am.

873
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,314
The lady would like
another cup of coffee.

874
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,798
Rafael.

875
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,437
Take the <i>senora</i> back to the Bar S.

876
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,233
- I'm not going back.
- Lf you have to tie her to the seat.

877
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,316
Why don't you try it, then?

878
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:35,915
- Give me those.
- No, please, <i>senora.</i>

879
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:38,636
I must do as I am ordered.

880
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,239
All right.

881
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,756
Nothing's changed, has it?

882
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:57,033
Five years, and I'm still saying,
"You just can't hit your brother.

883
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:01,117
"He's your brother,
and he's only got one arm.

884
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,797
"You just can't hit your brother.
He's only got one arm."

885
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,433
Spoken like a Saunders.

886
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,917
If you ever set foot on Bar S again,
I'll kill you.

887
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,239
I'll take that.

888
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,915
You think you can keep me here
against my will?

889
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,871
You're dead right I do.

890
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:30,070
- Lf I had a gun...
- You haven't.

891
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,148
But don't worry.

892
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:34,316
When I order music,
I always pay the piper...

893
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,396
whether I like the tune or not.

894
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,634
That band of horses is worth
about $30,000. They're yours.

895
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,151
As soon as the baby can be turned over
to a nurse, you can leave...

896
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:45,599
with the horses.

897
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:48,188
You can't make that much money
in that length of time...

898
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:51,437
in any occupation you're trained for.
Is it a deal?

899
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,679
It's a deal.

900
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,229
It's the best deal I ever heard of.

901
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:04,158
Because, you see,
a baby can't help who its father was.

902
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:06,635
But someday I might look
at the poor little thing...

903
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:09,035
and remember its name was Saunders.

904
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,628
It would be dreadful to hate a baby.

905
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,432
So we have a bargain.

906
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,759
I sell the baby for the money, right?

907
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:19,909
Sure.

908
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,231
The baby is here already.

909
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:58,918
I see I am too late.

910
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,110
I came as soon as
your rider got to my place.

911
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:04,516
- Got any goose grease?
- Goose grease? The oil of the olive.

912
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,029
Do you want this angel
to smell like a goose?

913
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,230
It doesn't matter. Whichever.

914
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,074
There.

915
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:20,635
He's a cute little fellow.
Looks just like you.

916
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,910
<i>Un momentito, hombre,</i> just a moment.

917
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,152
A son has been born.

918
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:36,156
We must make a toast
with a little poetry before we drink.

919
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,517
- Salute to...
- I've been up all night.

920
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,949
I need the drink, not the poetry.

921
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,068
No toast.

922
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,314
The insult is unnecessary, <i>amigo.</i>

923
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,350
A man must do what he must do.

924
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:58,555
Sure.

925
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:02,313
And he will act properly, if he's a man.

926
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,911
But not all males are men.

927
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:10,829
You were greased in that room.
We drank to a male child.

928
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:15,195
I regret that it took me 30 years
to learn I made a mistake.

929
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,638
She's fine, Colt.

930
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:37,277
To the happy parents.

931
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,395
How do you feel now, Mrs. Saunders?

932
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,876
That's a mighty fine boy.

933
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,190
You'd better take him, Maria.

934
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,718
Thirty years...

935
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,957
is a lifetime, <i>amigo.</i>

936
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:57,279
My lifetime.

937
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,715
This is something you're not part of.

938
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:09,952
I'll say it again:
A man must do what he must do.

939
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,873
I have been thinking about Mexico lately.

940
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:23,158
After I take the <i>senora</i>
to the stagecoach...

941
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,077
I will go on from there.

942
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,835
I will take my sons with me...

943
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:32,638
and go to Mexico.

944
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,918
You can find yourself
another <i>gran vaquero.</i>

945
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:20,719
Hey, Commissioner.

946
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:24,915
That one-armed Saunders, the one
the brother run out of the country...

947
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,439
just rode up.

948
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:30,637
Odd, him coming here.

949
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,356
We heard your brother run you off.

950
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:43,631
Well, Saunders, I must say
I'm surprised at seeing you here.

951
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:47,669
- You remember Cable, don't you?
- Yes, I do.

952
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:52,278
I remember my first sight
of Mr. Cable at Bar S...

953
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,470
with his gun slung real low.

954
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:58,196
Funny thing, all the show-offs
who wanna think they're gun-slingers...

955
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,231
carry their guns like that.

956
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:01,753
Hello, Cable.

957
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:05,555
You don't mind going outside, do you?
I wanna talk to your boss.

958
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,716
You can wait on the porch.

959
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,358
Excuse us, Cable.

960
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:25,194
And now, Mr. Saunders, your business.

961
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:30,718
Daybreak, and the coyotes are getting
ready to scurry back to their holes.

962
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:35,079
Your provisional government's
collapsing, huh? And you're running.

963
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:38,278
Without stealing the biggest plum
on the tree:

964
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:42,513
- Bar S.
- Your business, Mr. Saunders?

965
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:45,709
In Texas, it's customary
to offer a man a drink...

966
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,035
when he's ridden 200 miles to see you.

967
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,474
And you'd better learn
Texas manners, Harrison.

968
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,194
If we're going to be partners, that is.

969
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:00,313
Possession is nine points of the law,
they say.

970
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:04,752
If you were on Bar S, it would be hard,
maybe even impossible, to put you off.

971
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,628
Especially if you and I were partners.

972
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,275
And if Colt Saunders were dead.

973
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,238
May I offer you a drink?

974
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:43,032
When you hear three shots,
you'll know it's worked.

975
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,555
Supposing he kills you on sight?

976
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:50,839
Then I'll be dead, and you can
scuttle away to some saloon...

977
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,669
where you can tell the dance hall girls
what a desperate man you are...

978
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:57,837
with your gun slung way down,
almost to your knees.

979
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,996
Three quick shots. Good luck.

980
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,793
I sure ain't looking forward to
being partners with that Reb.

981
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,035
Don't.

982
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,318
Both brothers go.

983
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:39,079
- But afterward, somebody might...
- We'll have to take care of that, too.

984
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:42,592
Any witnesses could cause trouble
in the future.

985
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:44,792
There's the woman.

986
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:51,032
Of course. A clean sweep.

987
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:53,669
Sure.

988
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:06,718
<i>Senor</i> Colt.

989
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:15,279
My brothers and I wish to say farewell.

990
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:20,239
Of course,
Papa could say it much better.

991
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,668
Our hearts are very sad, <i>Senor</i> Colt...

992
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:29,999
but we must go.

993
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:49,432
The <i>senora</i> will be out in a moment,
<i>Senor</i> Colt.

994
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:58,108
- <i>Senora?</i>
- One moment, Maria.

995
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:48,116
I wanted to give you this.
It's the bill of sale for the horses.

996
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:54,595
- I wanted to talk to you, too.
- There's been enough said. Too much.

997
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:57,558
Well, I've been thinking about you
and the baby...

998
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:59,796
and how you feel about the baby.

999
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:03,154
You'll have trouble selling the horses
without that.

1000
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:04,508
I'm not selling the horses.

1001
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:06,358
You'll need them
to keep the ranch alive.

1002
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:09,040
- Lf you're taking my son...
- I'm not taking the baby.

1003
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:11,037
I want him to have Bar S.

1004
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,398
It's more than
I could ever give him, so...

1005
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:17,198
Colt, listen to me.

1006
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:21,548
When you're raising the boy,
will you try to remember something?

1007
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:25,958
Try to remember that
people aren't perfect. They just aren't.

1008
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,629
They make mistakes.
And when they do, they suffer.

1009
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:34,359
They pay. Inside themselves, they pay.

1010
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:39,348
So when he makes his mistakes,
and he will...

1011
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,589
try to find it in you to forgive him.

1012
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:57,754
- Lorna, wait.
- <i>Senor,</i> a rider comes.

1013
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:01,439
- Get out.
- But the rider is <i>Senor</i> Cinch.

1014
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,518
You said you'd kill me
if I set foot on Bar S.

1015
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,028
I'm on Bar S and you're wearing a gun.

1016
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,476
You got a reason for coming here?

1017
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:33,910
Might be I came back
to get something belonged to me.

1018
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:42,233
- Hello, Lorna.
- Hello, Cinch.

1019
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:45,916
No need to say you're beautiful.
You'll be that when you're 80.

1020
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:47,951
It's that kind of beauty.

1021
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:23,436
Hands high! Everybody.

1022
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,275
Remember, <i>amigos,</i>
you're a large family.

1023
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,231
There'll be many
to mourn the foolish one...

1024
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:42,557
or two, or three.
Whoever makes the first move.

1025
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,675
Now careful, real careful.

1026
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:51,518
Undo those gun belts.

1027
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:57,879
Do it, <i>amigo.</i>

1028
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:20,513
Not you, Colt.

1029
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:22,918
You keep your gun.

1030
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,111
<i>Vaquero,</i> back against the wall. <i>Ándale!</i>

1031
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:45,390
Now, everybody be real still.

1032
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:58,149
You've been a hero since the day
you carried me in from the south range.

1033
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:03,798
And ever since, I stood in your shadow.
The cripple and his big brother.

1034
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:07,589
- I always thought you were a <i>loco.</i>
- Walk soft, <i>gran vaquero.</i>

1035
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:15,479
Now, hero...

1036
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:32,039
you have until the bottle is empty
to draw.

1037
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,832
And then I'll kill you in cold blood...

1038
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:36,633
whether you have
a gun in your hand or not.

1039
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:50,109
Go on, draw, <i>hombre.</i>

1040
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:57,870
That wouldn't fit the hero:
A woman in the line of fire.

1041
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:01,994
Draw!

1042
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:05,953
- I can't.
- Can't.

1043
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:18,239
It must be wonderful to have a woman
care that much whether you live or die.

1044
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,390
There's the end of the whiskey.

1045
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:37,951
Draw or I'll kill you!

1046
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:44,948
I can't.

1047
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,394
All right.

1048
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:38,430
You win, you old goat.

1049
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,431
Don't nobody move a muscle.

1050
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:51,995
All right, all of you, reach.

1051
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:01,118
A little room.

1052
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:07,679
You, too.

1053
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:09,753
Nice and high.

1054
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:17,439
That's it.

1055
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,472
Give it a kick.

1056
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:35,596
- The Commissioner says to go ahead.
- He don't want them outside?

1057
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:37,676
No. In here.

1058
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:01,033
- Quick, you cover this side.
- Right.

1059
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:10,309
Come on!

1060
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:35,039
<i>Senora.</i>

1061
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,675
You weren't even frightened.

1062
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,113
He's fine.

1063
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:00,799
He's gone.

1064
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:07,439
At times,
a Saunders has not lived well...

1065
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,391
but they always die well.

1066
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:12,639
Poor Cinch.
