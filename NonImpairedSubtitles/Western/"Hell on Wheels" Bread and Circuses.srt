1
00:00:32,414 --> 00:00:35,091
It is good to make
this sacrifice

2
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:38,705
where the sun can
look down and see you.

3
00:00:40,087 --> 00:00:44,753
It is a great privilege
to dance with the sun.

4
00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:48,770
The sacrifice will be hard,

5
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:52,063
but you are strong... and brave.

6
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,251
You will not give up,

7
00:01:03,376 --> 00:01:05,386
as I did not give up

8
00:01:05,511 --> 00:01:08,679
when my father brought
me to this place.

9
00:01:12,518 --> 00:01:14,285
Ah.

10
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:35,137
Follow the sun...
All day and pray.

11
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,472
If you are strong and true,

12
00:01:37,638 --> 00:01:40,752
your sacrifice will be rewarded

13
00:01:40,877 --> 00:01:43,311
and you will have a vision.

14

15
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,113
Ahem.

16
00:03:20,404 --> 00:03:21,952
Ma'am.

17
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,083
It's not your manners, Mr. Bohannon.

18
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,414
It's your manner.

19
00:03:27,678 --> 00:03:28,834
Beg your pardon?

20
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,888
Yesterday...

21
00:03:31,013 --> 00:03:32,712
When everyone was running
from the disaster...

22
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:35,257
You walked calmly in.

23
00:03:36,786 --> 00:03:41,596
You are their hero, Mr. Bohannon.

24
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:43,306
Lily!

25
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:44,669
I just heard from your father.

26
00:03:44,794 --> 00:03:46,017
Everything is arranged.

27
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:54,317
I'm assuming you're here to see me?

28
00:03:54,483 --> 00:03:56,580
Yes, sir, um...

29
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:59,249
Payroll didn't come in
on the train this morning.

30
00:03:59,374 --> 00:04:01,617
Mr. Bohannon, one
of the reasons I spared

31
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,886
your neck was because
I thought you were a capable man.

32
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,245
Was I mistaken?

33
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,922
No, sir, but the men
are already grumbling

34
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,040
about not getting their
pay last week, sir.

35
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:11,418
Well, see the Swede about petty cash.

36
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,171
Mr. Durant, uh, that
won't cover the men's pay.

37
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,998
Of course not, you idiot.

38
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:18,258
It's for the walking bosses,

39
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,202
but keep quiet about it.

40
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,137
We don't want a riot on our hands.

41
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,439
Just keep the men in line

42
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,725
until you get your money
troubles sorted out.

43
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:30,378
My problems are no concern of yours,
Mr. Bohannon.

44
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:33,398
Actually, today Mr. Durant,
your troubles are mine.

45
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:37,861
But y'all go have yourselves
a nice picnic, all right?

46
00:04:50,254 --> 00:04:55,003
Reverend... I can find someone
else to help with this.

47
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,298
Just a moment to catch my breath.

48
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,740
Whoo-yah! Yah!

49
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:06,669
Get the hell out of the way.

50
00:05:15,278 --> 00:05:19,382
We need to ride out and speak
to many horses immediately.

51
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:23,073
My father's people won't
feel threatened by 4 men.

52
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,630
Well, these men are the
eyes of the Union Army,

53
00:05:25,755 --> 00:05:27,698
the tip of the spear.

54
00:05:27,823 --> 00:05:31,039
Let's go.

55
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,372
Business has been slow, Mr. Swede.

56
00:05:34,497 --> 00:05:35,706
We will pay ya though.

57
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:37,003
Yeah.

58
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,173
We just need a little more time.

59
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,180
Well, thank you, gentlemen.

60
00:05:44,305 --> 00:05:50,016
Thank you for telling me that you
are unable to pay what is owed.

61
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:54,856
I shall give you
a little more time, hmm?

62
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:58,733
See, I told you Mr. Swede
was a reasonable man.

63
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,061
Heh.

64
00:06:00,186 --> 00:06:01,319
Yeah.

65
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:02,998
Don't say that.

66
00:06:03,123 --> 00:06:05,634
Yeah.

67
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,371
He just took one of our slides.

68
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,741
Are you sure we can find them?

69
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:15,142
Yes.

70
00:06:15,267 --> 00:06:17,211
But they're not going
to be happy to see us.

71
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:18,879
Why is that?

72
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:24,259
These rituals... they're not
meant for white man's eyes.

73
00:06:34,453 --> 00:06:35,603
Father?

74
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:38,148
Father?

75
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:45,037
It's Ruth...

76
00:06:45,162 --> 00:06:46,406
Your daughter.

77
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:51,411
What are you doing here?

78
00:06:52,837 --> 00:06:55,540
Mother died.

79
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,376
I came to find you.

80
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:01,720
Well, we'll send you to
the mission in council bluffs.

81
00:07:01,845 --> 00:07:03,673
They'll take care of you.

82
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,718
The mission sent me here.
They said...

83
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,721
Yea, you're not staying here.

84
00:07:13,055 --> 00:07:14,434
I have nowhere else to go.

85
00:07:17,593 --> 00:07:20,160
She can stay in the church tent.

86
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:23,985
At least till we get back.

87
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,979
I'll decide where
you go when we return.

88
00:07:29,104 --> 00:07:31,534
In the meantime,
there's a bed in the back.

89
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,008
Thank you, father.

90
00:07:51,157 --> 00:07:53,390
How long has it been
since you've seen her?

91
00:07:54,227 --> 00:07:56,559
12, 15 years.

92
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:59,187
I don't exactly recollect.

93
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:02,607
And you're just going
to leave her here...

94
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,818
In a place like this?

95
00:08:08,007 --> 00:08:09,807
You're right.

96
00:08:21,653 --> 00:08:26,056
There are some things
I need to tell you.

97
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:36,475
There's... bacon in the bear box...

98
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,069
And... and... and coffee and flour.

99
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:44,549
Don't let the, uh,
the drunks stumble in and...

100
00:08:44,674 --> 00:08:47,943
And sleep on the pews.

101
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:52,647
There's a butcher knife under...
Under that altar if you need it.

102
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:59,253
And just... you know,
try to make yourself useful.

103
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,899
Don't leave the tent...

104
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:07,861
You know, unless, uh...
It's on fire.

105
00:09:10,098 --> 00:09:11,865
Understood?

106
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:29,191
Either the roof or...
Mum's hair was set ablaze...

107
00:09:29,316 --> 00:09:32,363
By the Harrigan brothers?

108
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:33,895
Those bastards.

109
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,367
Did they say they were
able to put the fire out?

110
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:37,999
Uh...

111
00:09:38,124 --> 00:09:40,201
What the hell is this strange wind?

112
00:09:40,326 --> 00:09:41,873
The bloody last page is missing.

113
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,798
Oh, Jesus!
It's a whirlwind!

114
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,699
Where did you...

115
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,705
No. No, no, no!

116
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:58,018
Bloody hell.

117
00:09:58,143 --> 00:09:59,307
What are you...

118
00:10:02,981 --> 00:10:05,688
We thought you said you were
going to give us more time.

119
00:10:05,854 --> 00:10:09,859
You asked for a little more time,

120
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:14,948
and that's what I gave
you. A little more time.

121
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:31,640
Put your backs
into it there, boys!

122
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,386
Come on! Work, you mules.

123
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,971
Hey, up!

124
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,557
I want all the walking
bosses right here, right now.

125
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,477
Thomas, Toole...

126
00:10:48,957 --> 00:10:51,101
Y'all are getting paid
to work the men

127
00:10:51,226 --> 00:10:53,236
until the payroll
situation gets figured out.

128
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:56,739
Again?

129
00:10:56,905 --> 00:10:59,367
If they aren't paid,
they'll strike, Mr. Bohannon.

130
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,578
Then you keep quiet
as long as you can.

131
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:05,039
Hey, now, walking bosses only.

132
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:06,916
I am a walking boss.

133
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,710
Tell 'em you made me a walking boss.

134
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,670
Get back to work.

135
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,955
This about all you walking
bosses getting paid again

136
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,258
and we ain't gettin'
paid again, right?

137
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:21,931
Tell you what... you keep
your mouth shut and you keep your job.

138
00:11:22,097 --> 00:11:23,098
Now, get back to work.

139
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:24,434
Come on!

140
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:33,318
Someone needs to put
that boy in his place.

141
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,376
2,000 miles due west
lies the Pacific ocean,

142
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:38,879
and yet I remain stranded here,

143
00:11:39,004 --> 00:11:42,239
blocked by the great rocky mountains.

144
00:11:43,641 --> 00:11:48,249
The rocky mountains...
They are some 500 miles from here.

145
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:53,960
Beyond that rise,
the Platte River forks.

146
00:11:54,085 --> 00:11:57,129
Do I follow it to the North or South?

147
00:11:57,254 --> 00:11:59,564
A mistake here and
we could miss our strike

148
00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:03,056
on the Rockies by hundreds of miles.

149
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,851
I'm assuming you strike
the mountains at any route you take.

150
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:10,242
The problem is not striking
the mountains, Lily.

151
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,769
The problem is crossing
the mountains.

152
00:12:16,472 --> 00:12:20,718
And you think Robert was
the only person who knew the way?

153
00:12:20,843 --> 00:12:24,956
It took him 7 years
and my open purse...

154
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:28,289
But yes, he told me he'd found it.

155
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:34,504
Surely there'll be other surveys?

156
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,599
Oh, yes. Ha ha.

157
00:12:36,724 --> 00:12:39,235
Yes, someone will
build this railroad,

158
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,572
but... without the secret,
which Robert took to his grave,

159
00:12:42,697 --> 00:12:45,074
it will not be me.

160
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:52,071
If I'm remembered, it will
be as the man who failed.

161
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:02,681
Unfortunately, Robert will
probably not be remembered at all.

162
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:15,803
At pay up, I'm gonna buy
me a double hot soak.

163
00:13:17,262 --> 00:13:18,881
And liniment.

164
00:13:19,047 --> 00:13:21,843
And a bottle of whiskey
that don't burn going down.

165
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,043
Ha ha.

166
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:24,804
We ain't gettin' paid.

167
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:27,981
Well, they ain't paid us last week.

168
00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:30,059
I was figurin' on double pay today.

169
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:33,187
You might as well put
that tool down and go back to camp.

170
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,523
That's what I'm gonna do.

171
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,158
Hey!

172
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:41,918
Hey!

173
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:44,866
It ain't quittin' time.

174
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,132
It is for me.

175
00:13:46,257 --> 00:13:47,299
I done worked for free my whole life,

176
00:13:47,424 --> 00:13:49,203
I ain't doin' that no more.

177
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:52,081
You get back in that cut.

178
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:54,542
Get down off that horse
and put me in the cut.

179
00:13:58,902 --> 00:14:01,924
I don't need some slave
uprising on my hands this day.

180
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:05,720
That's how you see it?

181
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:13,478
All I see is some field hand
acting like a house boy.

182
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,147
Take off that gun.

183
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,386
Take it off.

184
00:14:34,002 --> 00:14:35,416
Give it to him now, boy!

185
00:14:47,514 --> 00:14:49,931
Mr. Bohannon!

186
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,232
I hired you to run these
men to build my railroad,

187
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:03,069
not to wrestle in the dirt
with your former chattel.

188
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,506
What is the meaning of this?

189
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:07,175
Payroll!

190
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,533
Lack of.

191
00:15:10,268 --> 00:15:13,746
And who told the men
there is no payroll?

192
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,836
I did.

193
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,005
Well, you told them nonsense.

194
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:28,694
Gentlemen, I see
that unfounded rumors

195
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:30,471
have caused tempers to flare.

196
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:36,269
Believe me, the payroll is en route,
merely delayed.

197
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,063
And as for you and
your sparring partner,

198
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,773
Mr. Bohannon,
I suggest you settle your differences

199
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:44,610
like the gentlemen
I know you all to be.

200
00:15:47,303 --> 00:15:50,658
This evening,
when you have completed your work,

201
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:54,953
I suggest a pugilistic match

202
00:15:55,078 --> 00:16:00,257
between Mr. Bohannon
and his negro Nemesis!

203
00:16:00,382 --> 00:16:01,558
A real fight.

204
00:16:01,683 --> 00:16:03,526
Yeah!
Yeah!

205
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:06,563
And to compensate
you for the tardiness

206
00:16:06,688 --> 00:16:08,365
of your well-earned pay,

207
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:14,307
I will donate 10 cases of
whiskey for your refreshment.

208
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:35,115
{pub}I didn't know you had a daughter.

209
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,108
Well, now you know.

210
00:16:39,277 --> 00:16:42,722
Why don't you ever speak of her?

211
00:16:42,847 --> 00:16:45,824
Are you really going
to send her away?

212
00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:50,509
You know, Jesus says,
"if any man come to me

213
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:54,466
"and not hate his father
and hate not his mother

214
00:16:54,591 --> 00:16:56,735
"and his wife and his children

215
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:02,605
and his own life,
then he cannot be my disciple."

216
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:06,525
I don't think I have enough hate
in my heart to be a good Christian.

217
00:17:09,272 --> 00:17:10,905
Whoa. Whoa.

218
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:19,823
Black moon.

219
00:17:19,948 --> 00:17:21,457
Father.

220
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:26,170
Why have you brought this
man to our sacred place?

221
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,444
He's putting a curse on you.

222
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:44,513
He calls you black spider

223
00:17:44,638 --> 00:17:48,526
because you trapped
my son in your web.

224
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:52,687
Joseph came to Christ
on his own free will.

225
00:17:52,812 --> 00:17:55,413
Is that so?

226
00:17:56,741 --> 00:18:00,195
Tell me, do you have
no children of your own?

227
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,131
I had... I have a daughter.

228
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:07,067
Who just returned to him.

229
00:18:07,192 --> 00:18:08,879
Praise God.

230
00:18:09,045 --> 00:18:10,923
Where has she been?

231
00:18:12,664 --> 00:18:13,974
I left her.

232
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:18,431
You abandoned your
child and steal mine.

233
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:23,978
What kind of man are you?

234
00:18:25,442 --> 00:18:27,773
A flawed one.

235
00:18:28,045 --> 00:18:31,124
Father, reverend Cole has come...

236
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:33,988
Because he's concerned
for our people.

237
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,643
Chief, the soldiers
have already come.

238
00:18:36,768 --> 00:18:40,286
Yeah.
4 soldiers on horseback.

239
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,037
But more will come,

240
00:18:42,203 --> 00:18:46,838
enough to wipe out all the
human beings from the world.

241
00:18:46,963 --> 00:18:48,335
But there may be another way.

242
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:52,542
If you come to town,
we discuss peace.

243
00:18:52,667 --> 00:19:00,241
I will come, but only if
my son black moon asks me to come.

244
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:08,147
Please come...

245
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,960
For me.

246
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:17,958
Come inside, gentlemen,
and witness the greatest contest

247
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,603
in the history of hell on wheels!

248
00:19:20,728 --> 00:19:23,773
The finest corn liquor compliments

249
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:29,878
of Mr. Thomas Durant, president
of the Union Pacific Railroad.

250
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,579
Hey, over here.
Give me one of those.

251
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:35,217
You must be able to spell
your name to wager, you morons.

252
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:38,520
Now, who just flung down that silver?

253
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:41,656
This here's enough peppers
to make a Mexican cry.

254
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:44,282
It'll probably kill you.

255
00:19:50,271 --> 00:19:51,899
Sean's putting everything
we got in you.

256
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,693
I thought you were broke?

257
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,572
We put the magic lantern
up for collateral.

258
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:02,451
- Sure that was a good idea?
- Sure.

259
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:04,370
The whole town's betting on you.

260
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:10,617
There's time enough if you want
to place a bet on yourself.

261
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,618
Nah.

262
00:20:12,743 --> 00:20:16,021
I ain't doin' this for money, Mick.

263
00:20:16,146 --> 00:20:19,549
Then why are you doing it?

264
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:26,198
Hmm. That man needs
to be put in his place.

265
00:20:26,323 --> 00:20:29,634
There's only one thing
he understands.

266
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:35,317
What if, God forbid...
You were to lose?

267
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:46,341
That ain't gonna happen.

268
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,723
You win this fight,
they're gonna kill you,

269
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,605
and if you lose,
they're gonna kill you

270
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,007
for thinkin' you could win.

271
00:21:10,132 --> 00:21:11,441
You don't understand.

272
00:21:11,566 --> 00:21:13,105
This is somethin' I gotta do.

273
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:14,411
Why?

274
00:21:14,536 --> 00:21:16,146
Because you're half white...

275
00:21:16,271 --> 00:21:18,319
Or because you're half black?

276
00:21:22,076 --> 00:21:27,256
All my life folk
been tellin' me who I am.

277
00:21:27,381 --> 00:21:30,092
One white man tell me I'm a slave,

278
00:21:30,217 --> 00:21:34,896
another one say I'm free.

279
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:39,624
Tonight I say who I am.

280
00:21:59,545 --> 00:22:01,028
{pub}Hello.

281
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:05,025
Tonight and one night only,

282
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,693
you will be allowed in.

283
00:22:06,818 --> 00:22:09,596
But one sign of misbehavior...

284
00:22:09,721 --> 00:22:12,164
And I will throw you all in chains.

285
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,634
Understood?

286
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:15,876
Good.

287
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:18,037
You are welcome. Come in.

288
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:19,405
Yeah. That's it.

289
00:22:20,864 --> 00:22:21,974
Your corner here.

290
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:24,101
Mr. Ferguson's corner.

291
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:25,777
Bloody hell.

292
00:22:25,902 --> 00:22:29,148
Look at what the bowels of
the place have s out.

293
00:22:53,362 --> 00:22:55,416
Get the bloody hell out.

294
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,341
What do you think you're doing?

295
00:23:02,338 --> 00:23:04,258
Make way for Mr. Bohannon.

296
00:23:25,225 --> 00:23:27,770
You gonna win this fight, ya hear?

297
00:23:27,895 --> 00:23:29,408
You gonna win this fight for us.

298
00:23:29,824 --> 00:23:31,368
You hear me?!

299
00:23:40,006 --> 00:23:42,951
Jesus, he is a big buck,
Mr. Bohannon.

300
00:23:43,076 --> 00:23:46,120
It ain't all about the brawn, Mick.

301
00:23:50,817 --> 00:23:55,362
Now, this fight is going
to be a fair fight.

302
00:23:57,256 --> 00:23:59,567
No grappling below the waist.

303
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:02,649
No eyeball gouging.

304
00:24:03,028 --> 00:24:04,905
No biting.

305
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,988
No unnecessary kicking.

306
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:15,829
Now, the fighters will come from
their corners and toe this line.

307
00:24:17,442 --> 00:24:21,721
Mr. Dix is going to be the referee...

308
00:24:24,849 --> 00:24:28,050
For this contest.

309
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:33,198
Now, I assume both fighters
are ready to fight.

310
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:40,270
Toes on!

311
00:24:54,158 --> 00:24:56,144
Yeah!

312
00:25:04,185 --> 00:25:04,878
Fight!

313
00:25:10,758 --> 00:25:13,679
Push them back, will ya?

314
00:25:32,712 --> 00:25:34,867
All right, boys,
back to your corners.

315
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,115
Back to your corners.

316
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,461
30 seconds!

317
00:25:40,586 --> 00:25:43,264
Out of the way.
Sit down.

318
00:25:51,363 --> 00:25:55,299
The bank is denying the request
for a credit extension.

319
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:07,086
Reply.

320
00:26:07,211 --> 00:26:09,922
If credit not extended forthwith,

321
00:26:10,047 --> 00:26:14,293
will call in all shares
of aforesaid bank stock

322
00:26:14,418 --> 00:26:19,030
to be joined by other
4 major investors. Stop.

323
00:26:19,155 --> 00:26:23,916
Anticipate collapse of bank
by close of business tomorrow.

324
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,637
Stop.

325
00:26:25,762 --> 00:26:27,730
And send.

326
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:38,740
Samson brought
the temple down on his head.

327
00:26:40,176 --> 00:26:43,454
I will happily do the same.

328
00:26:47,271 --> 00:26:48,692
Give him a fat lip, Mr. Bohannon!

329
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:50,461
He already has two, lad!

330
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,279
Get in there and fight, boy.

331
00:26:57,156 --> 00:26:59,002
Get him!

332
00:26:59,127 --> 00:27:01,495
Knock him down!

333
00:27:18,245 --> 00:27:21,548
Knock his nappy n head off!

334
00:27:22,181 --> 00:27:24,393
Punch his black arse back to Africa!

335
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,985
Get up!
On your feet.

336
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,150
Are you gonna start fighting or what?

337
00:27:32,316 --> 00:27:34,569
Huh?

338
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:43,328
About to see this now.

339
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,553
All right, break it up.
Break it up.

340
00:27:52,678 --> 00:27:55,622
Give us some room!
Give us some room!

341
00:27:55,747 --> 00:27:57,925
Give us some room.
Back it off!

342
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,616
Get him to the corner, now.

343
00:28:02,554 --> 00:28:04,298
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

344
00:28:04,423 --> 00:28:05,799
What?

345
00:28:05,924 --> 00:28:07,894
He ain't fighting.

346
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,358
What the hell's
wrong with you, boy? Huh?

347
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:18,211
Is it 'cause you ain't never
hit no white man before?

348
00:28:18,336 --> 00:28:21,074
Is that it?

349
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,050
Look here, son...

350
00:28:24,175 --> 00:28:29,254
That man who sired you,
that won't your father,

351
00:28:29,379 --> 00:28:32,794
that a white man
who raped your mother.

352
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,493
You know?

353
00:28:34,618 --> 00:28:37,563
The same man done
beat you all your life

354
00:28:37,688 --> 00:28:41,467
with his foot on your neck. Huh?

355
00:28:41,592 --> 00:28:46,183
The same man who say he your master...
When you supposed to be free.

356
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:49,102
Huh?

357
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,857
Look over here.

358
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,152
That's him sitting
on his soft white ass.

359
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,416
Huh?

360
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:02,275
I want you go over there...

361
00:29:03,311 --> 00:29:07,621
And I want you to kill him.

362
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,459
You hear?

363
00:29:09,584 --> 00:29:13,129
You go kill him.

364
00:29:13,254 --> 00:29:16,755
You ain't gonna do this for us...

365
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,925
Do this for you.

366
00:30:13,377 --> 00:30:15,487
Take a knee, Mr. Bohannon.

367
00:30:15,612 --> 00:30:17,089
Take a knee!

368
00:30:17,214 --> 00:30:21,150
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

369
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:26,950
Come on!

370
00:30:28,724 --> 00:30:30,521
Don't worry.
Don't worry.

371
00:30:30,646 --> 00:30:32,070
You still in this.

372
00:30:32,195 --> 00:30:35,125
You sill got him, Mr. Bohannon.
You still got it. Don't worry.

373
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,586
Take a breather, boy.
Take a breather.

374
00:30:40,062 --> 00:30:42,940
{pub}Lent to thy neighbor
in time of his need.

375
00:30:43,065 --> 00:30:45,302
He paid thou thy neighbor again...

376
00:31:05,349 --> 00:31:07,280
Excuse me.

377
00:31:59,036 --> 00:32:01,576
You're almost there.

378
00:32:12,712 --> 00:32:13,853
Mrs. Bell?

379
00:32:15,761 --> 00:32:16,978
Where have you been?

380
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:18,736
I looked all over for you.

381
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,890
I took a walk.

382
00:32:22,658 --> 00:32:24,901
And then I heard all the commotion.

383
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,636
Ah.

384
00:32:26,761 --> 00:32:31,608
It's a little vulgar for a lady's taste,
I'm afraid.

385
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:42,377
Ah, I'm afraid my Latin was
a little undernourished.

386
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,629
Bread and circuses.

387
00:32:47,547 --> 00:32:54,389
You engineered this fight as a
distraction until you could get payroll.

388
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:58,832
Just like the Romans
did with unruly crowds,

389
00:32:58,957 --> 00:33:01,068
give them food and spectacle.

390
00:33:01,193 --> 00:33:03,737
Ahh.

391
00:33:03,862 --> 00:33:07,235
I think you overestimate
my abilities, Lily.

392
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:10,844
I hope not, for all our sakes.

393
00:33:10,969 --> 00:33:12,446
Holy mother of God.

394
00:33:12,571 --> 00:33:15,248
You had us worried there.

395
00:33:15,373 --> 00:33:17,384
I thought for a wee bit

396
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:20,654
we'd lost our wager, right, Sean?

397
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:23,585
Sean?

398
00:33:24,949 --> 00:33:26,254
Sean?

399
00:33:37,795 --> 00:33:40,310
Shall I walk you back to the car?

400
00:33:48,338 --> 00:33:50,904
I have Robert's maps.

401
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:57,846
And yes... he found the route.

402
00:33:59,615 --> 00:34:00,914
To the Rockies?

403
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,875
And beyond.

404
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,795
And you've had them all this time.

405
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:09,631
I have.

406
00:34:11,626 --> 00:34:15,195
I knew it!
I knew it!

407
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:24,146
Oh, I could strangle you
and embrace you at the same time.

408
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:25,914
Where are they?

409
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:27,982
They're in a safe place.

410
00:34:30,845 --> 00:34:33,012
Ah.

411
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,909
How much?

412
00:34:38,075 --> 00:34:41,620
What Robert is owed.

413
00:34:53,832 --> 00:34:56,643
All right. Let's go. Let's go.

414
00:34:56,768 --> 00:34:58,144
All right.
That's right.

415
00:34:58,269 --> 00:35:01,057
That's right.
You gonna do this. That's right.

416
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,061
Time!

417
00:35:07,478 --> 00:35:09,522
Now, boy.
Now!

418
00:35:13,316 --> 00:35:16,428
You got it.

419
00:35:16,553 --> 00:35:18,430
Come on, Bohannon!
One more time.

420
00:35:18,555 --> 00:35:19,798
Get in there.

421
00:35:19,923 --> 00:35:21,590
Come on!

422
00:35:28,097 --> 00:35:29,440
Come on, Bohannon!

423
00:35:29,565 --> 00:35:30,608
Get your hands up.
Hands up.

424
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:32,801
Come on, boy!

425
00:35:36,705 --> 00:35:37,927
Come on, Bohannon.

426
00:35:51,352 --> 00:35:53,610
Get in there.

427
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,530
It's over.
It's over.

428
00:37:47,436 --> 00:37:49,596
Why are you so glib?

429
00:37:50,429 --> 00:37:52,103
We just lost everything.

430
00:37:54,904 --> 00:37:57,233
I bet it all on the darkie.

431
00:37:59,693 --> 00:38:02,374
30 to one.

432
00:38:04,911 --> 00:38:07,994
We're rich, brother.

433
00:38:09,949 --> 00:38:12,493
What'd you use?

434
00:38:12,618 --> 00:38:15,696
The liniment, hmm?

435
00:38:15,821 --> 00:38:18,899
Was it a little pepper
powder to the eyes, was it?

436
00:38:19,024 --> 00:38:21,424
Are you trying to get us both killed?

437
00:38:23,028 --> 00:38:27,305
And Mr. Bohannon... being
our only friend and all.

438
00:38:29,834 --> 00:38:33,770
This is my only friend.

439
00:38:58,928 --> 00:39:00,662
Ohh.

440
00:39:04,266 --> 00:39:06,094
Are you all right?

441
00:39:06,368 --> 00:39:08,930
Never better.

442
00:39:10,873 --> 00:39:12,841
Good.

443
00:39:16,845 --> 00:39:19,056
Did you enjoy the fight?

444
00:39:19,181 --> 00:39:20,590
Very much.

445
00:39:20,715 --> 00:39:23,945
Good.

446
00:39:26,488 --> 00:39:28,422
Unh.

447
00:39:30,358 --> 00:39:33,302
Thank you for the water.

448
00:39:33,427 --> 00:39:34,861
Unh!

449
00:39:58,585 --> 00:40:00,662
Ah.

450
00:40:18,903 --> 00:40:21,271
Next.

451
00:40:23,107 --> 00:40:27,187
Gregory Toole, walking
boss for cut crew 3.

452
00:40:27,312 --> 00:40:29,844
And to be completely honest
with you, Mr. Bohannon,

453
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,483
we thought you had more in you.

454
00:40:37,487 --> 00:40:39,932
Mmm.

455
00:40:40,057 --> 00:40:44,527
Life does have its surprises,
don't it, Mr. Toole?

456
00:40:47,497 --> 00:40:49,465
Next.

457
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:57,215
Elam Ferguson, walking boss...

458
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,582
Freedmen cut crew.

459
00:41:04,513 --> 00:41:06,680
Ahem.

460
00:42:00,032 --> 00:42:02,143
You have done it, my son.

461
00:42:02,268 --> 00:42:04,772
The sacrifice is over.

462
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:11,551
Father... I was blessed.

463
00:42:11,676 --> 00:42:15,283
I had a vision.

464
00:42:17,182 --> 00:42:21,789
I've seen a great steel beast,

465
00:42:22,086 --> 00:42:25,731
its breath was smoke...

466
00:42:25,856 --> 00:42:28,004
It shook the ground.

467
00:42:32,462 --> 00:42:35,231
I killed it.

468
00:42:35,802 --> 00:42:39,640
