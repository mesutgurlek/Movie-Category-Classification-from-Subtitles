1
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,470
An impressive sight,
General Pershing.

2
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,990
That's the kind of muscle we need
to stop these damn raids.

3
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,110
l don't have muscle...

4
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,279
but l have speed, that's
the reason for the train.

5
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,515
Luck...

6
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,798
and a little information.

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,479
l'll find Cordoba.

8
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,710
8 to 5 they don't get
that gun up in one try.

9
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,150
-You're on.
-You lose, soldier.

10
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,873
You're going to help them.
All of you. On your feet.

11
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,909
Move.

12
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,908
-Clay, l've got something here.
-An insect, probably.

13
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,629
Slide some whisky in that ear,
you'll be alright.

14
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,634
-l'm giving you a direct order.
-My men aren't under your orders.

15
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,798
They're in the U.S. army
and they'll obey orders.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,672
They'll do what l tell them.

17
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,955
And l say they don't drill...

18
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,388
they don't work,
they don't salute.

19
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,909
They just fight.

20
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,269
Jackson, Adam.

21
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,990
Six field pieces, general.

22
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,871
M-1902, 3 inch, pivot traverse,
panorama sighting.

23
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,075
Enough fire power
to blow a town apart.

24
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,550
Six guns. l want them.

25
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,033
l want to know
where they will be...

26
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,871
how they are guarded,
and by whom.

27
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,309
l want those guns.

28
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,552
Alright, we'll split up here.

29
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,112
Cordoba's looking for recruits.
We'll ride in separate.

30
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,031
Adam, keep your mouth shut.

31
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,350
Your brother won't be there
to look after you.

32
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,668
l'll make you a bet.
l reach Cordoba before you do.

33
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,391
Don't bet with me, boy. You don't
know enough to tie your sweatband.

34
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,469
Don't get your foot
caught in a bucket.

35
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,235
Not unless it's filled
with beer.

36
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,034
Get the hell out of here.

37
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,474
''Adios, amigo''.

38
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,356
He's young,
but he'll settle down.

39
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,437
How far? Six feet?

40
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,552
Excellent, huh, Svedborg?

41
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,519
We can use them.
Where did you find them, pistolero?

42
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,999
A Texas labour gang.

43
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,040
We figured we could join
your revolution.

44
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,077
We brought you as many men
as we could.

45
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,998
Remember, hombres...

46
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,476
it's better to die on your feet...

47
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,880
than live on your knees.

48
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,672
He's softening, General.
l think he's about to break.

49
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,639
You have a musical ear,
Svedborg.

50
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,356
A perfect pitch
for human weakness...

51
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,070
but you enjoy it
too much.

52
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,869
Adam...

53
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,118
My God, it's your brother.

54
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,759
l am General Cordoba.
Listen to me.

55
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,630
We know about Pershing's train
and the guns...

56
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,796
but, where is it going?

57
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,633
They'll kill him.

58
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,469
That's right.

59
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,755
What are we going to do,
just stand and watch?

60
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,190
That's right.

61
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,277
You son of a bitch.

62
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,229
Where is the train?

63
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,955
Where is the train?

64
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,032
Springs...
Harmon Springs.

65
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,548
When will it arrive?

66
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,679
Tuesday night.

67
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,878
Correct, General.
That is what our friend says.

68
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,799
The Revolution has many friends,
for a price.

69
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,155
Kill him.

70
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,428
The Revolution
has many friends...

71
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,033
for a price.

72
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,397
General Pershing. Fred Tate,
mayor of Harmon Springs.

73
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,828
Tate. Please.

74
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,113
That's a hell of a sight...

75
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,878
all those cannons.

76
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,436
But will they stop those
damn greasers raiding us?

77
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,835
No, Mayor Tate, l will.

78
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,197
-Do we get a detachment of cavalry?
-Not likely.

79
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,394
Then you're selling a lot of bull.
Look, this is an election year...

80
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,589
Fred.

81
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,470
You know l used to run 80 000 acres
of range across the border...

82
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,352
before l got raided out?

83
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,357
l want those bastards
cured, right?

84
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,031
Right, and the way to do it is
to get soldiers along the border.

85
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,598
The army doesn't have enough men
to watch 1200 miles of border.

86
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,313
That is why we need you.

87
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,388
Don't be polite, General.
l'll tell him.

88
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,713
The senator asked me to set this up,
so this is the way it'll be.

89
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,990
You'll raise an auxiliary and
patrol your own section of border.

90
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,229
Any raid, you yell, and the army
comes in and mops up.

91
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,029
And if they don't come?

92
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,956
Don't sell the army short.

93
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,551
You execute your part of the plan,
we'll do the rest.

94
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,152
-High.
-Your play.

95
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,108
Watch the machine guns,
forward, back.

96
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,598
l'll get to Pershing.

97
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,433
Slow him down.

98
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,150
We have some time.
Why don't we find some amusement?

99
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,759
Thanks, pal.

100
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,749
Texas.

101
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,509
Here.

102
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,312
Thanks, sport.

103
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,350
Not me, him.

104
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,908
l'm in no hurry.

105
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,352
l'll fix that, honey.

106
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,312
We'll have fun.

107
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,475
Well, l smell a little ripe...

108
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,238
You said it, honey.
l didn't.

109
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,716
We can forget it. l don't want
to make you throw up.

110
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,714
Hey, honey. l got paid.
l'm a professional.

111
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,997
Don't you worry,
we'll be just fine.

112
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,315
Don't be too long.

113
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,714
Ruby!

114
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,109
Yes, sir.

115
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,275
What buffalo pit did he come out of?
That'll cover it. Come on, big man.

116
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,799
Wait a minute.

117
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,156
Wait a minute.

118
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,429
Wait, wait a minute.

119
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,519
Stop making such a fuss. lt'll
be just as good when you're clean.

120
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,631
Listen, we don't do laundry here.
You get a bath after you're stripped.

121
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,234
Do you know anything about
pistols?

122
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,954
Enough to know all you have to do
is pull the trigger.

123
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,148
You washed there already.

124
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,999
l'll wash down here then.
Better?

125
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,236
Don't you think it's time
to rinse me off?

126
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,953
l think so. There you go.

127
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,556
What a specimen you are.

128
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,831
l think you're clean now.

129
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,989
Out you get.

130
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,829
Thank you.

131
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,988
Just a second.

132
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,598
One second.
Just... just...

133
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,040
Now, l've got to go out
for a minute.

134
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,317
You get the rest when
l come back, OK?

135
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,158
Honey, we were just
getting started.

136
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,554
Well...

137
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,515
maybe later.

138
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,716
Douglas.

139
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,832
Gently, captain,
soft and gentle.

140
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,270
Cordoba's in town
with a small army.

141
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,913
What?

142
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,317
He came to get our cannon.

143
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,832
Why didn't you warn us
earlier?

144
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,634
They're watching,
the town's full of them.

145
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,354
Tell the general Cordoba will set off
an explosion as a distraction.

146
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,198
He's going to hit
from the rear.

147
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,072
With a mob of bandits?

148
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,670
With trained light cavalry.

149
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,996
He's counting on surprise.
You can chop him up like sausage.

150
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,272
Be ready.

151
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,756
-Hey now, you're touchy, captain.
-And you're off limits.

152
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,353
l just wander and play my music.
No law against that.

153
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,393
-Then wander in another direction.
-Yes, sir.

154
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,915
You play an excellent game
of chess.

155
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,709
l don't get the chance
too often.

156
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,433
l have enjoyed it.

157
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,753
We aim to please.

158
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,554
Are you a soldier?

159
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,152
l like to think so.

160
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,869
Now.

161
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,508
Evening, ladies.

162
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,831
Ready, honey?
Those things are too sharp.

163
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,995
l can't stay.

164
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,155
Where are you going?

165
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,270
Outside.

166
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,040
Outside? What's the matter?
Don't you like me?

167
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,877
Yeah. lt's just something
that runs in my family.

168
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,752
You never can tell.

169
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,918
No questions.
No resistance.

170
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,835
Get that ammunition out!

171
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,754
Fire brigade!

172
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,630
Get the machine guns set up
in a crossfire pattern.

173
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,955
Yes, sir.

174
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,479
Keep it up!

175
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,355
Jackson.

176
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,152
Why don't they use
the machine guns?

177
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,952
Cordoba's got them.

178
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,390
Long live General Cordoba!

179
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,389
Let's go.

180
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,795
Where have you been?

181
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,752
General, we lost the train.

182
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,555
Let's go.

183
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,036
-¡Viva Cordoba!
-¡Viva!

184
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,115
32 men killed,
26 men wounded.

185
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,320
And six artillery pieces lost
to those damn bandits...

186
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,991
plus a personal attack on myself and
making jackasses out of the army.

187
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,919
Your pride might be wounded,
but l lost eight good men.

188
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,113
Don't be insolent. Your mission
was to learn of Cordoba's plans...

189
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,074
we got no warning.
The fault is clearly yours.

190
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:47,436
Yes, l made a major tactical error,
l relied on Captain Riggs.

191
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,868
Riggs was a fine officer.

192
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,718
He got himself decoyed
and butchered.

193
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,273
That'll do, Captain.

194
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,434
Let's get on with
the tactical plans.

195
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,518
How accurate is this model
of Cordoba's fortress?

196
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,669
As accurate as
the captain's report.

197
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,834
We never saw the place,
but Harkness and l...

198
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,110
got descriptions
from Cordoba.

199
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,431
lt's here, in the mountains.

200
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,029
More than 200 miles in. And
that country's worse than rough.

201
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,800
l ran cattle down there
for 12 years.

202
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,356
The roads are dust for nine months
and mud for three.

203
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,950
Get caught in the attack,
Mr. Warner?

204
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,312
Not too bad. l just
didn't duck quick enough.

205
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,591
General, the last 40 miles
are all open country.

206
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,790
Then there's not much chance
of surprising Cordoba.

207
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,910
No chance, l'd say. lt's his country,
he's on a mountain top.

208
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,588
Steep cliffs,
one road.

209
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,918
With those cannons, he's the hero
of every peon in northern Mexico.

210
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,994
Ready!

211
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,835
Fire!

212
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,994
Fire!

213
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,875
Fire!

214
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,749
l want those guns destroyed.

215
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,994
l estimate one month to arrange
supplies, transport...

216
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,589
diplomatic agreement.
An expeditionary force.

217
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,234
You can't go into Mexico
with the army.

218
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,714
Why not?

219
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,148
A gringo invasion?

220
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,158
Exactly. They should be
taught a lesson.

221
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,552
Lessons, Colonel,
are taught in a classroom.

222
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,509
You are talking about killing people
to prove a point.

223
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,837
Those people will fight
to prove a point.

224
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,918
l'm not interested
in your opinions.

225
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,756
l'm interested in one thing:
a solution.

226
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,635
Yes, sir.

227
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,670
l want someone to get inside
that fortress.

228
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,915
You mean me, sir?

229
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,876
You, and the men you need.

230
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,708
You'll be travelling
out of uniform...

231
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,513
without authorisation...

232
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,994
without orders.

233
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,833
lf you're caught...

234
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,473
you'll be shot.

235
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,355
But l want those guns
destroyed.

236
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,916
l want Cordoba.
And l want him alive.

237
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,113
At ease, Lieutenant.
Captain Douglas...

238
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,516
this is Lieutenant Gutierrez, liaison
from the government of Mexico.

239
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,195
Lieutenant.

240
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,958
l'm assigning him
to your unit.

241
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,195
What?

242
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,759
My orders are to bring the traitor
Cordoba to Mexico city for trial.

243
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,157
l'll try for the guns,
l'll even try for Cordoba...

244
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,032
but l'm not carrying him.

245
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,518
l was assured
full co-operation.

246
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,676
''Nada personal, teniente.
Llevaré sólamente mis hombres.''

247
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,198
l speak excellent English.

248
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,073
Good, then you understand.
You don't go.

249
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,279
That's your decision.

250
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,188
Thank you, sir.

251
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,070
Don't thank me, l'm not indulging
you. l'm gambling your life.

252
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,594
Yes, sir.

253
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,029
The cannons, right?

254
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,275
And Cordoba.
You volunteered.

255
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,870
Fine. Anyway you look at it,
you're a dead man.

256
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,318
Pick your time.

257
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,639
l will.

258
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,435
Look at that,
busted clear off.

259
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,277
l'm completed the calculations.

260
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,354
The guard will change
in three minutes.

261
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,677
Meanwhile, this man
is the only one on duty.

262
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,315
So what?

263
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,193
l also determined this lock
can be opened easily.

264
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,229
Why don't you just give it
a try, Greek?

265
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,759
l have.

266
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,988
Howdy, Captain.
Did you come with my pardon?

267
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,314
Released in my custody,
Corporal.

268
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,397
Released? They just about
killed me.

269
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,113
They didn't.

270
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,275
Where are we going?

271
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,708
Trouble.

272
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,998
Next time l get you two
in here...

273
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,510
l'll strip you down and
chain you to the bunks.

274
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,438
l've never stolen
a bunk before.

275
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,112
200 miles into the
Sierra Occidental?

276
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,276
Long, weary trip.

277
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,598
Are you declining, Andy?

278
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,076
No. l wouldn't miss this dance
for nothing.

279
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,034
l enjoy watching you go into
the jaws of death...

280
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,356
and come out with somebody's
gold filling.

281
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,754
l'll get out.

282
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,229
l might just bring you out too.

283
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,075
With that guarantee,
bring me along.

284
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,195
l will not go.

285
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,318
lt's a people's revolution in Mexico.
l won't help to put it down.

286
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,717
We won't attack the people. We're
going after one man, Cordoba.

287
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,272
You want to help the people?

288
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,994
You know l do.

289
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,757
Somebody's got to get Cordoba.
That's what l'm going to do.

290
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,032
Perhaps you're right.

291
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,439
Now, to get him,
we've got to isolate him.

292
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,871
l don't know, it sounds
awful rough, Cap.

293
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,911
Maybe we ought to
forget it.

294
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,959
You're gutless, Andy.

295
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,713
No, l just want
to live forever.

296
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,558
l'll send the medal
to your mother.

297
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,116
Gentlemen, may l present
our Mexican ally.

298
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,198
''Teniente'' Antonio Gutierrez.

299
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,998
He's pretty.
He's kind of noisy though.

300
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,553
That's insolent.

301
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,760
You're talking to an officer
of the Mexican army.

302
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,518
There's no rank.

303
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,949
We're all equals, except for me,
being a little more equal.

304
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,555
Throw him out.

305
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,710
You need somebody
to isolate Cordoba.

306
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,751
l can provide that somebody.

307
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,749
Who?

308
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,757
No, not unless l go along.

309
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,789
You're bluffing.

310
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,471
l don't trust you either. The
introductions will be inside Mexico.

311
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,352
When? Where?

312
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,672
ln two days. ln Madera,
the Casa de Extraños.

313
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,110
We might stop by.

314
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,277
You're a stubborn man, Lieutenant.
Why?

315
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,835
Once l was proud of my regiment.
lt had honour.

316
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,394
Now, it no longer exists
because General Hector Cordoba...

317
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,115
betrayed it. l will have payment
for that betrayal...

318
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,638
even if l have to use you.

319
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,318
How far are we going
to trust him?

320
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,389
Jackson.

321
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,754
Andy.

322
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,959
Peter.

323
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,359
l want that ready
by 5am.

324
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,876
l've got some reconnaissance
in town.

325
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,871
There's a fellow
l want to see.

326
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,636
Very attractive, darling.

327
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,236
Thank you so much, darling.

328
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,669
Don't knock my accent, Rod.
lt's my only talent.

329
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,279
Honey, that is a shameful lie.

330
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,475
l don't know if l like that.

331
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,953
lt makes me sound cheap.

332
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,075
l'm not. When l choose a man,
l'm faithful to him.

333
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,996
Warner might not think that,
when he finds out what you told me.

334
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,794
Harry is sweet,
and generous.

335
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,955
l've been absolutely faithful
to him. Like l told you.

336
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,630
But l'm leaving this hole
in the morning, so what the hell!

337
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,719
Stop explaining. You convinced me
a long time ago.

338
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,310
There's still a couple of hours
until morning.

339
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,631
And a couple of things
l've got to check out.

340
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,273
l thought you loved me.

341
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,913
l do.

342
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,192
For your beauty...

343
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,754
your fire, your talent...

344
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,150
and your first class cigars.

345
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:06,709
Pilot paid 30 pieces of silver.
ls Cordoba giving you 80 000 acres?

346
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,718
Take my advice.

347
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,991
Never trust a lady.

348
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,717
Company still with us?

349
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,118
No. As soon as we left the main road
they stopped tracking us.

350
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,153
Four of them moved straight on.

351
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,873
They're waiting for us.

352
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,673
That means we ride into them.

353
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,759
And make sure we're the only ones
that ride out the other side.

354
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,558
lt's a good thing we've got
Mr. Warner with us.

355
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,638
He knows all about everything,
don't you, Mr. Warner?

356
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,957
l think Mr. Warner
wants to say something.

357
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,478
l'll have you court-martialled
for this.

358
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,590
lf l'm wrong, you can.

359
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,793
What do you want?

360
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,911
Just the pleasure
of your company.

361
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,479
Like l keep telling you,
never trust a belly dancer.

362
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,635
What did you pay her?

363
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,034
Nothing.

364
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,873
Maybe she loves me.

365
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,273
We're about to find out.

366
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,431
Peter, go round the back.

367
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,198
Warner, your friends are expecting
four of us.

368
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,437
You are number one.

369
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,714
There's an ambush up ahead,
right behind that monastery.

370
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,269
Don't shoot! lt's me!
Don't shoot!

371
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,033
Don't shoot!

372
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,468
Don't shoot!

373
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,475
You get them all?

374
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,589
Yeah.

375
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,749
Bad?

376
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,196
No. Move your arm.

377
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,151
lt'll do.
Thanks for your concern.

378
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,869
Anytime.

379
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,432
lt should be cleaned first.

380
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,674
Later.

381
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,909
Jorge Campo, a major
in Cordoba's army.

382
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,999
Alright, let's go.

383
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,235
Are you alright?

384
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,668
How's Warner?

385
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,315
He's dead.

386
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,031
lt's been one bitch of a day.

387
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,516
l'm sore down to the bone.
How are you feeling?

388
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,675
Mean.

389
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,074
Sorry.

390
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,069
Jackson.

391
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,591
Come cut this slug out of me.

392
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,549
Why me?

393
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,194
Because you've got
a steady hand.

394
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,199
lt's right here.

395
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,429
There?

396
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,634
That's right.

397
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,839
Get on with it.

398
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,232
Get on with it.

399
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,992
Anything you say.

400
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,234
lt's not so deep.

401
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,718
A nice neat job.

402
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,549
Any time.

403
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,999
Oh, boy.

404
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,880
This is what l call
taking it soft.

405
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:53,555
First class genuine oak wood jerky,
first class water...

406
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,431
and a 10 minute rest
every 20 hours.

407
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,792
That's right, Andy.

408
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,759
You get to ride drag, just as soon
as you finish enjoying your dinner.

409
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,956
l surely do thank you.

410
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,952
A taste of water.
Taste of dust from here on.

411
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,275
When l was a boy in Greece, a man
could live for a week on that...

412
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,588
-and another week on living rock.
-Why did you come here?

413
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,638
l came for the third week.

414
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:28,593
Madera is just past those hills.
About 3 hours, l'd say.

415
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,869
We'll make it in two.

416
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,278
Even if it kills us?

417
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:37,111
You say that with some feeling.
Peter, set your watch at 1.15.

418
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,837
Mr. Gutierrez, please?

419
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,868
23.

420
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,992
A light, amigo?

421
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,675
Who is it?

422
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,598
l'm very cautious.

423
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,959
Where's your man?

424
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,793
Here.

425
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:32,439
Miss Leonora Cristobal,
Captain Rod Douglas.

426
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,797
Am l satisfactory?

427
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,071
What's she got to do
with Cordoba?

428
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,838
He has a great weakness.

429
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,712
l know, for women.

430
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:55,875
Leonora is a woman,
and an attractive one.

431
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,438
You're volunteering for a job
a whore might turn down.

432
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,312
l have my reasons.

433
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,915
Well...

434
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,959
this job works
by my reasons.

435
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,398
You don't fit into them.

436
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,195
You're an idiot.

437
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,152
Captain Douglas, listen.

438
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,110
l want Cordoba dead.

439
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,712
l'll do what's necessary
for that.

440
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,630
What's necessary is to let him make
love to you. Do what he wants.

441
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,151
And make believe you enjoyed it.
Why do you want to do that?

442
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,509
Because...

443
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:40,638
Cordoba's bandits raided
our hacienda.

444
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,991
He killed my father
and my brother...

445
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,629
as l watched.

446
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,234
Are you satisfied?

447
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,996
No. Women bury their dead
and keep on living.

448
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,468
You're dodging. Why?

449
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:03,433
l know what it is to let him
do what he wants with me.

450
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,755
He...

451
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,113
raped me...

452
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,518
and left me with my dead.
l want him killed.

453
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,234
We're not going to kill him.

454
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:16,515
What?

455
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,395
The government wants him tried
publicly ...

456
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,033
disgraced, not martyred.

457
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,235
But l swear to you,
he will be executed.

458
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,516
We're going to try to blow the cannon
and bring him out with us.

459
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,910
You'd have to distract him.

460
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,119
Do you know what that means?

461
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:42,995
Yes.

462
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:59,474
Captain Douglas,
my family is dead.

463
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,320
l myself am also
a little dead.

464
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,312
l want Cordoba to pay
for those deaths.

465
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,232
What's the connection
between you two?

466
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,875
Our families were friends.

467
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:26,473
Alright.
l'll gamble a little.

468
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,279
Try to keep Cordoba entertained.

469
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,757
Make a map of his personal quarters.
Guards, doors, access.

470
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,312
Go in early in the morning.

471
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,511
You've got that much time
to reconsider.

472
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,718
My considering is done.

473
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,393
l'll be there tomorrow.

474
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,795
l'll arrive as an officer
of Cordoba's own regiment...

475
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,673
anxious to join him for
excitement and loot.

476
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,116
You'll be thoroughly
convincing.

477
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:14,438
Leonora, are you set?
He didn't exaggerate.

478
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,958
l'll survive.

479
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:21,274
Your Captain Douglas
is well-suited to Cordoba.

480
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,952
With luck...

481
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,437
they'll kill each other.

482
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,712
lt'll be a hell of a climb
up that mountain.

483
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:34,276
l've been looking at it,
l'm not enjoying the sight.

484
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,273
You two will enjoy it more
about half way up.

485
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,557
lf Andy and l can get to the gate,
we'll welcome you in.

486
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,268
What about that lady?

487
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,192
lt's a gamble.
lf she can hook Cordoba, fine.

488
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,868
lf not, we'll do it
the hard way.

489
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,557
ln any case, we'll stick to plans.
Climbing equipment?

490
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:01,078
Yes.

491
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,235
Explosives?

492
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,556
Dynamite. Two fuses,
slow and fast.

493
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:05,715
Flares?

494
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,911
lt'll be a hot party.

495
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:14,389
Right. Get rid of the horses,
and bury the gear.

496
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,878
Halt. Whoa.

497
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,194
Where are you going?

498
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,270
l wish to see
General Cordoba.

499
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,074
And who are you?

500
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:53,552
Lieutenant Antonio Gutierrez,
a deserter.

501
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:55,875
So?

502
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:00,872
So, l followed your example,
but more discreetly.

503
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:05,873
l found myself trained, skilled,
and bored.

504
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:10,314
ln Mexico City they said you'll own
half of northern Mexico.

505
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,317
l am a greedy man.

506
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:16,878
A greedy man.
A touching story.

507
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,554
l joined forces with
Lieutenant Gutierrez...

508
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,398
for my own reasons.

509
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,398
Yes, l remember now.

510
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:02,477
From a hacienda outside Madera,
Cristobal.

511
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,158
You remember?

512
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:07,956
Leonora Cristobal.

513
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:12,636
Señorita Cristobal,
how could l forget?

514
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,912
l couldn't forget either.

515
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,233
The way you took me...

516
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,989
No man had ever touched me
before.

517
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,270
So, you come back to me
in friendship?

518
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,629
Yes.

519
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,593
And how shall l welcome you?

520
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,390
With gratitude, l hope.

521
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,991
For what?
For the love of a woman?

522
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:53,279
For information.
This man is Antonio Gutierrez...

523
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:56,916
sent here by the Mexican government
to capture you.

524
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:01,875
With him, are four Yankee soldiers
commanded by Captain Douglas.

525
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,393
What have you done?
l'll kill you!

526
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:11,991
Excuse me, l forgot to introduce
Major Svedborg.

527
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:16,593
He's a first class cavalry
officer. And a sadist.

528
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:21,349
Which is why he had to leave
Sweden to join me.

529
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:27,359
l overlook cruelty
in exchange for...

530
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:29,993
efficiency...

531
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,913
and loyalty.

532
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:45,869
Well, well, well.
Look who's here...

533
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:49,238
dragging his tail back
and only a week late.

534
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,996
l got cut off,
l had to walk.

535
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,909
You mean you ran off. Then you
heard we had the guns...

536
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:59,351
so you came back to join
the Revolution. Who is he?

537
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:03,394
l don't know. l met him
on the road. Another volunteer.

538
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,315
How do?

539
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,555
Texas.

540
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,474
Where have you been?

541
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:16,515
l got cut off during the raid.
l got wounded, had to walk back.

542
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,515
Where?

543
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,398
ln the shoulder.

544
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,710
That's a fresh wound, Texas.

545
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,909
Keep him under guard until
l get back. Him too.

546
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,396
Take their guns.
Keep them under guard.

547
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,073
Stand over there.

548
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,874
We have heard there are
Yankee spies nearby.

549
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:09,517
They want to destroy the Revolution,
everything you've worked for.

550
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:10,914
We must find them.

551
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:15,355
Five men will search the base of
the mountain. The rest, straight out.

552
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:18,314
We want them alive, if possible.
Let's go.

553
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,678
Come on, move it!
Go on, quickly!

554
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,876
Leonora!
This won't do you any good!

555
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:10,671
You betrayed Douglas and his men!
But there'll be others!

556
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,915
lf she looks this way,
we're snake bit.

557
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,797
She seems to be occupied
for the moment.

558
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,591
This Captain Douglas,
what was his plan?

559
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,552
l was to make love to you,
distract you...

560
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:54,355
to give them time to destroy
the guns and then take you.

561
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,839
l would think you'd hate me.

562
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:04,358
You ripped me apart
and went away.

563
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,159
And l hated you.

564
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,873
But you took me.

565
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,719
And you still have me.

566
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,715
Your story better hold up,
or...

567
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:12,549
We looked everywhere.
No trace of anyone.

568
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:19,511
Provision a patrol. Search
everything half a day's ride out.

569
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,709
lf Svedborg takes us to Cordoba,
that bitch will be right there.

570
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,396
When they stop looking at you,
get lost.

571
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,636
l've got to see
our friend Antonio.

572
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,193
ln the cooler?

573
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,118
l'll try.

574
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:45,399
Get me out later tonight,
9.30.

575
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:52,115
l'll get you out.
How the hell will you get in?

576
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,233
The hard way.

577
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:57,673
Sergeant Ortega.

578
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:20,753
Ortega!

579
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,038
lt's over, boys.

580
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,514
You afraid?

581
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,080
No. l've got other things
on my mind.

582
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:29,909
Why?

583
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,793
l don't know.

584
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,595
l think it's the night. lt reminds me
of the darkness of a grave.

585
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:14,359
Antonio?
Where are you?

586
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,073
Over here.

587
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:22,637
You're easy to find.

588
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,398
Leonora betrayed me.

589
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:26,915
How much did she tell?

590
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,109
Everything.

591
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,118
Come on, give me a hand.

592
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:40,191
Two things you should never
do with a woman...

593
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,914
argue with them,
and trust them.

594
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:00,510
Get a piece of paper and make me
a map of Cordoba's rooms.

595
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:16,312
Cordoba uses the old chapel
as his office.

596
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:20,479
His private quarters are next to
the cloister in the old dining hall.

597
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:21,669
Rear entrance?

598
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:24,519
No. lt backs on the cliff.

599
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,551
The only way in is through
the chapel.

600
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:29,634
That means over the roof.

601
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,039
ls that the entrance?

602
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,195
Yes.

603
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:59,477
Charming, isn't it?

604
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:03,437
Peasant work.
Crude, but reverent.

605
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:08,518
This was the Father Superior's
room.

606
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:10,831
l took it for my own.

607
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,797
How pious of you.

608
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:18,473
The peasants are superstitious.

609
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:21,319
l use their superstition.

610
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:28,069
l use whatever comes...

611
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:30,555
to hand.

612
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,192
-What's up?
-Nothing.

613
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:26,875
Hey...

614
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:32,472
l've orders to bring the prisoner
to the general.

615
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,075
Let's go.

616
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:16,588
Howdy, Captain.

617
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,195
What time is it?

618
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,549
Nine thirty.

619
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:28,796
Do as he says.
l'll see you at the stables.

620
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:34,551
''Buenas noches'', Lieutenant.
l brought you a uniform.

621
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,079
Undress him.

622
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:41,835
Come on.

623
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:49,039
Have you authorised the removal of
the officer from the guardhouse?

624
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:50,036
No.

625
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:53,471
One of the guards and a sergeant
went to take him to the General.

626
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:56,838
Curious.
l'll speak to the General.

627
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:00,555
Colonel, the General requested
privacy for tonight.

628
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,037
Check the guardhouse.
Wait there.

629
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,671
Where is the General?

630
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,075
Who is it?

631
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:40,235
Your tea, General.

632
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:41,429
Go away.

633
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:45,599
Your tea, General.
lt's ready.

634
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,832
lt's ready, General.

635
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,794
General?

636
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:01,279
Back off.

637
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:14,156
General, may l introduce Captain
Douglas, the man l told you about.

638
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:18,350
l know you talked,
but you got him alone.

639
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,991
That's all l wanted.

640
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:24,755
Bitch.

641
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,195
lt's a shame.

642
01:23:58,520 --> 01:23:59,475
What?

643
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:02,194
These guns have beautiful
mechanisms.

644
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:05,115
You've got a mechanic's soul.

645
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:08,951
l like machines,
they can be trusted.

646
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:12,879
Not like people.

647
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:18,639
Some people can be trusted.

648
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:23,789
Yeah, some.

649
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,159
Know what this is?

650
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:40,479
A flare gun.

651
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:43,558
Right. Burst of smoke,
burst of fire.

652
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:47,277
We'll put a shell into
everything that'll burn.

653
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,792
Ammo here,
explosives here...

654
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,072
stored hay.

655
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:00,195
Got it?

656
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:01,395
Yeah.

657
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:02,749
Sure?

658
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,433
l'm a trained officer.

659
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:09,673
So far, all l've seen you do
is fall over your own feet.

660
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,393
Your insolence...

661
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,588
Now, look here.

662
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:19,795
lf you want to play soldier with me,
prove you can hold up your end.

663
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:21,951
l'll prove anything you like.

664
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:27,353
Attaboy.
Let's get moving.

665
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:39,074
4 minutes.

666
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,553
She's set.

667
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:42,949
Go ahead.

668
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,312
That's it, get the door open.

669
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,033
Ain't that pretty?

670
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:07,955
That's it. Keep moving.
Meet at the stables in 10 minutes.

671
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:29,234
Guard the guns!

672
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,669
What is she doing here?

673
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:22,598
l missed her.
Come on.

674
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:35,355
All present and accounted for.
ls she coming along?

675
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:36,913
lf you don't mind.

676
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:43,671
l never minded a pretty woman
in my whole entire life.

677
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:51,629
When are we going?

678
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:54,031
The boys will tell us.

679
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,149
Where's Pete?

680
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:38,355
He didn't make it.

681
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,356
Bring Cordoba and the girl.

682
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:46,355
Ready.

683
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:47,549
Andy.

684
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:10,153
You bastard.

685
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,594
Andy!

686
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:20,076
We'll rest the horses here.

687
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:33,430
l told you once,
my place, my time.

688
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:43,234
Now.

689
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:48,714
He was my brother.
And you let him die.

690
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:53,189
l'm sorry your brother
got killed.

691
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:02,669
Well...

692
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:08,993
Jack, l've known you
a long time.

693
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:12,191
lf it'll make you feel better,
pull the trigger...

694
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,755
but don't look from
any help from me.

695
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:47,279
You bastard!

696
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:23,995
Jackson.

697
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:06,310
He was shot from behind
by one of his own men.

698
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:08,954
He's been dead since
we left the fortress.

699
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:13,358
The general's not
going to like that.

700
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:15,154
Why not?

701
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:19,077
You destroyed the guns,
Cordoba is dead...

702
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:21,273
You'll be a hero.

703
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:26,352
The trouble with being a hero
is the morning after.

704
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,954
Let's bury him.
