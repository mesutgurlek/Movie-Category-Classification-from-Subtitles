1
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:59,525
<i>( rain pattering )</i>

2
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:51,110
<i>( choir singing )</i>

3
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:20,439
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

4
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,848
( horse neighs )

5
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:41,293
<i>( men arguing )</i>

6
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:55,507
We got them agitated,
didn't we?

7
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,943
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

8
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,182
You ride with God today.

9
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:05,851
You know I ain't got
no religion.

10
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:09,721
Do you not fear the eternal
hell that awaits you?

11
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,424
I ain't planning
to see it just yet.

12
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:14,426
( men laughing )

13
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,632
Good people of Helena.

14
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,901
Good people of Helena!

15
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,537
I am saddened

16
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:30,642
<i>because today Helena loses
one of her true sons.</i>

17
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:33,712
Now we've cleansed
the Mexican filth from our city,

18
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:37,516
but the disease left behind
has infected our civility.

19
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,351
Man: <i>That's right!
You hear that?</i>

20
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:42,621
These brown heathens pushed
their carts through our land.

21
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:46,291
And instead of uniting
against these indignations,

22
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,660
we stand here divided.

23
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:51,763
Watch yourself, Jesse.

24
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,866
Abraham is trickier
than the devil in the shade.

25
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:58,770
And so,
on the challenge given

26
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:02,808
<i>to Abraham Brant
from Jesse Kingston,</i>

27
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,811
in the way
of a Helena duel,

28
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,546
are we now assembled?

29
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:09,748
Take care of my boy
if I fall.

30
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,986
We will.

31
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:21,660
Gentlemen, come forward.

32
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:25,264
God made this world, Jesse,
and it pains me little

33
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,332
to send you from it.

34
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,806
You shall pour out
each other's blood

35
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,909
and we will cover it
with dust.

36
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:43,882
Whomever bleeds
the dirt red the most today,

37
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,952
his deeds shall not
be forgotten.

38
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:29,027
<i>( choir continues )</i>

39
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,664
( horse whinnies )

40
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,842
You distinguished yourself
honorably against the Cheyenne.

41
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:19,978
It was the Comanche
in my day.

42
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,049
Either or, the most contemptible
breed of people, don't you agree?

43
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,385
Perhaps.

44
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:30,622
Or perhaps they're misunderstood,
Your Honor.

45
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:33,525
I understand you have
a problem with a dead Mexican.

46
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:36,661
Ross: <i>Not "a" dead Mexican,
Mr. Kingston.</i>

47
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,597
<i>Dozens.</i>

48
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,600
<i>The latest one is the nephew
of a Mexican general...</i>

49
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,802
<i>Ernesto Calderon.</i>

50
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:47,439
<i>He went missing along with
his sister some time ago.</i>

51
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:50,442
<i>The general... kicking up
quite a fuss about it.</i>

52
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:52,944
<i>He's threatening to bring a
battalion of Mexican soldiers</i>

53
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:55,147
<i>across the border
to look for his niece</i>

54
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:57,082
<i>and the man who killed
his nephew.</i>

55
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:01,453
Now, I don't need to tell you,
wars have started over less.

56
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,955
Now, all the bodies
are turning up

57
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,525
in the same strainer
in the river...

58
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:08,193
about here.

59
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:12,097
It's roughly 12 miles
from Mount Hermon.

60
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:16,034
I take it you've heard
the name Abraham Brant.

61
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:22,474
Foolhardy stories,
tales from the war, mostly.

62
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:25,076
They call him the Preacher,
I believe.

63
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:30,682
I saw him once in Kansas
just before the war.

64
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:33,919
The ranchers near Wichita
were offering 50¢

65
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:36,021
for every red scalp
that was turned in,

66
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:39,157
and Brant showed up
with 1,000 of them.

67
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,626
Red, Mexican, negro...
it didn't matter,

68
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,563
as long as they had
dark hair and dark skin.

69
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:47,933
<i>And later, I saw him
preaching to half the town</i>

70
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:52,637
with a spirit that I have
neither seen before nor since.

71
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,973
And as God
as my witness,

72
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,643
I saw him
lay his huge hand

73
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,513
on this gimpy
teenage girl.

74
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:05,016
And he cured her
with a touch,

75
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,552
<i>like Christ himself.</i>

76
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:13,825
Pardon me,
Your Honor, but...

77
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,161
but you'll have me believe
he simply touched the girl

78
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,029
and she walked?

79
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,031
All the way
to the church.

80
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,767
Married her
the next day.

81
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,003
I'm assuming he resides
in Mount Hermon.

82
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,807
He<i> is</i> Mount Hermon,
Captain.

83
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:31,076
Now you'll travel alone

84
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:33,778
under an assumed name
and profession.

85
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,715
Time is of the essence.
Calderon's blood is up.

86
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:38,683
Why not send me
with a company?

87
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,519
There's too much at stake.

88
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,788
You simply find out if Brant is
at the root of these killings

89
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,957
and wire me
from Fort McIntosh.

90
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,594
Once certain,
I will commit in force.

91
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,600
How long?

92
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:01,239
I'm not sure.

93
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,775
I think it's best
not to presume this time.

94
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:06,211
You've only
just now returned.

95
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,883
What is it?

96
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,922
David?

97
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:24,563
The man
I'm inquiring upon...

98
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,032
Abraham Brant is his name.

99
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:30,268
He may or may not be responsible
for some terrible things.

100
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,337
It's my job
to determine which.

101
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,575
Go on.

102
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,877
By some...

103
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:45,684
strange twist of fate,

104
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:49,854
Brant happens to be the same man
that killed my father 20 years ago.

105
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,093
Now, I know
what you're thinking,

106
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,330
but truth is, men like Brant have
orphaned hundreds of boys like me.

107
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:01,032
And it was
my father's challenge.

108
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:03,234
David, you know as well as I,
you will go there

109
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,970
and you will kill
this man.

110
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:07,906
You don't know that.
You can't know that.

111
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:10,609
<i>Why else would you
be sharing this?</i>

112
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,611
<i>I've never once
heard you speak like this.</i>

113
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:16,047
I'm curious,
that's all.

114
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,952
They say he's been
touched by God.

115
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:28,293
Marisol, I'll go
where they send me.

116
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:32,030
It's not as if I've been chasing
this man my entire life.

117
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,239
I can ride as well as you.
You taught me to track...

118
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,041
It's crazy talk.
We should change the subject.

119
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,709
You're gone more
than you're ever here.

120
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,978
What happened
to the Tompkins woman

121
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,681
only a month ago
was south of Austin.

122
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,983
<i>And not just some rogue
straggler we've somehow missed,</i>

123
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,286
but a band of Cheyenne
and Comanchero.

124
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,255
Would you like me
to describe to you

125
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,958
exactly what they did
to that poor woman?

126
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:06,765
This is coming
from the governor himself.

127
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,768
<i>At least here,
we both know you're safe.</i>

128
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:14,739
Since you took me,
you come and you go.

129
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:17,742
I'm left here
with nothing to do.

130
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:21,312
There's the Sheltons.
Donahues are less than a mile.

131
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:24,883
( speaking Spanish )

132
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:35,460
Marisol, this is a job.
It's my work.

133
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:40,432
You can't expect me to put
you in that kind of danger.

134
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:45,403
Then perhaps this time
when you return,

135
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,372
I will have left.

136
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,010
Excuse me.

137
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:55,974
( screeching )

138
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,933
You kill it,
you clean it.

139
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,220
<i>( distant coyote howls )</i>

140
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:18,356
Marisol: You've never
spoken about him.

141
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,626
Do you miss him?

142
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:25,396
From all accounts, Jesse Kingston
was recalcitrant and headstrong

143
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,932
and got what he deserved.

144
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:30,935
I figure he picked
the wrong fight.

145
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,539
What about you?

146
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,075
You ever miss old Javier?

147
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:39,344
You changed the subject.

148
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:42,280
( speaks Spanish )

149
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,320
It's impossible
to love someone

150
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,956
who hates their self
that much.

151
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
I miss nothing.

152
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:07,538
( screeching )

153
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:19,684
Morning, gentlemen.

154
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,523
Saw smoke.
Thought we'd see to some lodgings,

155
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,659
rest our horses.

156
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:31,296
What brings y'all
this way?

157
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,998
We're on our way
to Ciudad Victoria.

158
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,434
The map at Fort McIntosh
showed a town.

159
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,370
Mount Hermon, I believe.

160
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,609
Someone had the good
sense to chart it.

161
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,412
We figured we'd practice the same
good sense to stop and make use.

162
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:49,714
She family or help?

163
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,954
My apologies.
My name is David Locke.

164
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,322
This is my wife Marisol.

165
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:02,694
Of course, if there's
some trouble in town,

166
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:06,097
we could return to Fort McIntosh
and pass on word for you.

167
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:13,504
You need to see
the preacher.

168
00:16:57,717 --> 00:17:00,518
<i>( chatter )</i>

169
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,289
Put that down.

170
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,079
<i>( door opens )</i>

171
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:38,289
( Abraham muttering
in Latin )

172
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,324
We have new guests.

173
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,560
They're asking for lodgings.

174
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,530
They shall have it.

175
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:48,366
Welcome to Mount Hermon.

176
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,739
From where is it
that you come?

177
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,775
Houston, sir,
by way of Fort McIntosh.

178
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,411
My name is David Locke.
This is my wife Marisol.

179
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,619
I'm Abraham Brant.

180
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,456
You've met my son Isaac.

181
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:17,195
He says welcome.

182
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:24,702
Abraham: I am Mount Hermon's mayor
and law when there's need,

183
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:29,207
but I am unfailingly
the town's ethereal counselor.

184
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:30,808
Marisol,
are you religious?

185
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,510
I'm spiritual,

186
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:35,746
but I do not like
religion, sir.

187
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:38,382
Me neither.
And you, David?

188
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:40,585
My wife and I
are one and the same, sir.

189
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,520
<i>Please,
we are not formal here.</i>

190
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:45,857
"Abraham" works just fine.

191
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:50,695
- Abraham: Morning.
- Man: Morning, Abraham.

192
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:52,396
Here we are.

193
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:54,232
Make yourself at home.

194
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,800
Thank you, Abraham.

195
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,336
All we need now
is some rest.

196
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,204
I'll leave you to it.

197
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,639
<i>Buenas noches, Marisol.</i>

198
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:04,876
Mr. Locke.

199
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,524
We'll be here only as long
as we need to.

200
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:22,627
Just stick to the story,
let me do my job

201
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,662
and we can leave
this place,

202
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,764
just as easy
as we came in.

203
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,636
Okay?

204
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,504
Okay.

205
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:43,681
<i>( rooster crows )</i>

206
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,687
<i>( soft chatter )</i>

207
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:55,193
Morning, gentlemen.

208
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,235
Isaac: What are you
doing out here?

209
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,665
I never let the sun
catch me sleeping.

210
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:03,334
And I enjoy acquainting myself
with any new place.

211
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,269
How'd you find your cabin?

212
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:06,971
It was fine, Abraham.
Thank you.

213
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:11,609
- And Marisol?
- She's tired, resting.

214
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:15,580
If she's unsatisfied,
I could drop off another blanket,

215
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,615
<i>keep her warm.</i>

216
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:21,219
Well, it's a large bed. I doubt
you'd have a blanket big enough.

217
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,758
Isaac, you go on
without me today.

218
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,994
Mr. Locke is going
to join me for breakfast.

219
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,963
Well, I... I thought
we was going to go down...

220
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:34,298
Do I need to hold
your hand, boy?

221
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,808
Forgive my friends, David.

222
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:47,645
Their charming qualities don't
shine through at the outset.

223
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:48,980
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

224
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:52,650
<i>You strike me
as an educated man.</i>

225
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:55,019
I've managed to fool you.

226
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:58,956
You hide it
from your eyes well,

227
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:02,260
but it sits on your
shoulders plain as day.

228
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:05,663
You are a man
in search of something.

229
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:08,966
<i>Perhaps absolution.</i>

230
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,968
You don't strike me
as the type

231
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,537
to hide his meaning
in vocabulary.

232
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:17,375
Indeed.

233
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:21,345
We don't get a lot
of uninvited guests this way.

234
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:24,982
So why are you here?

235
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:28,286
There's no real plan to it.

236
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:31,956
I inherited my father's
mercantile in San Antone.

237
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,525
<i>I ran it for some years.</i>

238
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:37,595
Things got rough.
I was robbed, shot.

239
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:41,399
Both of us felt it was time to
move on, head nowhere particular.

240
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:43,634
My wife's family
are in Ciudad Victoria.

241
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,369
We figured we'd strike out
in that direction,

242
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:48,406
stop in a place
if we took to it.

243
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:50,541
Not so strange,
is it?

244
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:53,811
Welcome
to nowhere particular.

245
00:21:56,015 --> 00:22:00,084
Can't say it's the warmest
welcome I've ever received.

246
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:03,621
We're protective
of our little oasis.

247
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:06,557
How long
will you be staying?

248
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,793
Long enough to rest,
a few days.

249
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,565
Perhaps I can convince you
to stay awhile.

250
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,767
Why?
You've only just met me.

251
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:19,937
I know people.

252
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:25,109
And I can tell that you're
a man one can tie to.

253
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:29,447
Perhaps I can help you find
what you're looking for.

254
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,618
I'd have no trade
in this town.

255
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:39,090
Well, let's just say
a spot for town sheriff

256
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:42,126
just opened up
at this very moment.

257
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:48,632
I get the feeling there's not
a strong demand for law here.

258
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:52,403
- No.
- <i>And I have no experience.</i>

259
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:54,505
Well, what do you
need to know?

260
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:57,508
Just let your moral compass
be your guide.

261
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,478
<i>You're obviously
strong, capable.</i>

262
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,046
You're actually
being serious.

263
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:05,015
Look, David,

264
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,084
I like you and Marisol,

265
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,954
and I'd like to see you
stay awhile.

266
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:11,956
Not so strange.

267
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,725
No.

268
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,894
No, it's not.

269
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,430
Well, then,
it's settled.

270
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:22,032
Gentlemen,
meet your new sheriff.

271
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:34,979
Thought I might continue my ride,
take in some of your countryside.

272
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:36,747
Splendid idea.

273
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:40,651
As it happens, I have
my own fond recollections

274
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:44,889
of the San Antone area
from after the war.

275
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:46,657
Small town...

276
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:49,126
name of Helena.

277
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:51,862
<i>Might have passed through
her on your way here.</i>

278
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,664
Don't seem
to recall it.

279
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,603
Wild place
is what I recollect.

280
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,539
Hard to forget.

281
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,544
Well, Sheriff,

282
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:08,679
pick yourself
a direction.

283
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,851
( sniffs )

284
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:24,088
<i>( knock on door )</i>

285
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,590
Welcome to Mount Hermon,
Marisol.

286
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:28,125
We brought you both
some food.

287
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:30,794
And we just had to meet
the wife of the new sheriff.

288
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:33,030
- Sheriff?
- Did you have a long journey here?

289
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:36,700
- Yeah, but...
- <i>You are more beautiful</i> than was spoken of.

290
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,602
Who spoke?

291
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:04,628
( sniffs )

292
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:42,833
( woman humming )

293
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,677
( humming continues )

294
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,388
You live round here?

295
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:09,693
I from Tamaulipas.

296
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,831
Why have you come?

297
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,300
To pray for the dead.

298
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,802
You know about
the bodies?

299
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,739
( humming )

300
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:25,342
Was it white men?

301
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:27,411
( speaking Spanish )

302
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:51,802
( humming )

303
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:04,181
They knew things, David.

304
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,816
Who came?

305
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:07,985
Women from the town.

306
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:09,820
What did they want?

307
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:12,823
They said you were
the new sheriff,

308
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:15,893
that Abraham
foresaw us coming.

309
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:22,032
He did ask
that I be sheriff.

310
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:25,235
- But why on earth?
- I have no idea.

311
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:28,105
But I thought about it.

312
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:32,710
Really, it's the ideal cover until I
can figure out what's going on here.

313
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:36,780
He frightens me, David.

314
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:39,416
He's a man, Marisol,
not a crystal gazer.

315
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:44,722
- No one knew we were coming.
- Yeah.

316
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:47,758
These people, they're just
a bit off the reservation.

317
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,094
Make sure
you remember that.

318
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:57,301
- ( chatter )
- ( horse snorts )

319
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,181
Woman:
<i>Stop it.</i>

320
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:45,849
- Get away from me.
- ( slurring ) Now, now, wait.

321
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,285
Don't you walk away.
Come on.

322
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,988
<i>Don't you walk
away from me.</i>

323
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,189
<i>Where are you going?</i>

324
00:29:52,191 --> 00:29:54,792
Come on, have a drink.
Naomi.

325
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:03,534
( chatter )

326
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,979
- ( horses nicker )
- ( chickens clucking )

327
00:30:32,565 --> 00:30:36,366
I'm terribly sorry to have
frightened you, Marisol.

328
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,270
You're not feeling well.

329
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:45,075
No, I feel fine.

330
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:47,277
No, no, you have
the fever.

331
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,913
It's natural.
You're run down.

332
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:52,149
It will pass.

333
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,920
Can I give you a hand
with anything?

334
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:01,358
Are you married,
Abraham?

335
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,628
My wife died many years ago
birthing Isaac.

336
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:09,633
She left him
with many of her talents.

337
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:13,337
I'm sure
she was beautiful.

338
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:16,573
She could back the buzzards
off a gut wagon.

339
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:23,280
But truly, she was lovely.

340
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:27,284
There was never a more pure
heart to wreck a man.

341
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:32,923
So tell me,

342
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:36,393
how did you
come to wreck David?

343
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:41,298
My father was a drunk
and a swindler.

344
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:46,069
He was shot and left for dead
after cheating at cards.

345
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,572
David saw him
back to health.

346
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:52,476
As a show of gratitude,
I was betrothed to him by my father.

347
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,280
Betrothed by debt?

348
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:58,949
<i>That must have been
very difficult for you.</i>

349
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:01,318
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

350
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,553
Any children?

351
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:09,026
I'm afraid I'm unable.

352
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:13,096
Mmm. My wife was told
the very same thing

353
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,332
before I met her.

354
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,405
Dark eyes.

355
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:25,342
<i>They say the eyes</i>

356
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,412
<i>provide a direct window
to the soul.</i>

357
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:33,050
Yours have seen a good deal
of man at his worst.

358
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:36,353
<i>You hold tight to it.</i>

359
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:41,358
But are we not all
born into sin,

360
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,264
anger, violence,
jealousy, desire?

361
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:49,967
We cannot separate
ourselves from sin

362
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:54,004
any more than we would sever
a limb from our bodies.

363
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:59,409
<i>Besides,
anger is instructive.</i>

364
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,578
<i>Jealousy, understandable.</i>

365
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,549
Lust, perfectly natural.

366
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:13,991
I can see that my words
are not lost on you, Marisol.

367
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:16,760
It is refreshing.

368
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:21,765
So few these days possess
any openness of mind.

369
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:26,603
But if I may, Marisol,
this veil that you wear

370
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:28,772
offers only false comfort.

371
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:30,374
Remove it.

372
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:34,111
God knows
who you really are.

373
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:43,687
Ah, Deputy Dave!

374
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,655
What are you doing here?

375
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:48,158
Thought I might
get a drink.

376
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,028
Aw, you wouldn't
like it in here, David.

377
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,497
The beer tastes
like day-old piss.

378
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:57,734
Well, I guess
I'll drink the whiskey.

379
00:33:57,736 --> 00:34:02,305
I don't think
you're hearing me, Sheriff.

380
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:04,508
I'm telling you no.

381
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:13,450
( sighs ) I've tried to be
cordial with you.

382
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:16,486
You choose your next
words carefully.

383
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,403
- ( laughter, chatter )
- <i>( piano music playing )</i>

384
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:42,212
I heard the beer here
is excellent.

385
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:43,814
I've no complaints.

386
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:58,762
Might I join you?

387
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,730
Be my guest.

388
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:04,434
Hoot, let's have a shot
for the gentleman.

389
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,136
I'm Naomi.

390
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:07,571
David.

391
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:09,206
I know who you are.

392
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:13,176
Hoot his real name?

393
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:16,279
That's what I hear.

394
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:19,516
What else do you hear?

395
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:21,751
Whatever falls earshot.

396
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:27,324
You have an honest face.

397
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,862
I'm not soliciting you.
I know about your wife.

398
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:34,731
News travels fast.

399
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:38,368
This town echoes every word
Abraham breathes.

400
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:42,172
Stay here long enough and you
might start resounding him, too.

401
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:43,773
What about you?

402
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:46,843
Not yet.

403
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:49,412
How long have you
been here?

404
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:50,814
Almost a year.

405
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:54,384
My second husband was a
lieutenant in the army.

406
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:57,320
He was shot and killed
by his own men.

407
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,290
<i>I had no money,
no family, nowhere to go.</i>

408
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:05,729
Until Hoot here rides into town,
offers me a job.

409
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:09,599
Perhaps naively,
I didn't ask for specifics.

410
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:12,569
My condolences
for your losses, ma'am.

411
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:15,539
Thank you.

412
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:19,609
I've tried to make
the best of it.

413
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:22,445
Save a little money,

414
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:24,481
maybe move
to San Francisco.

415
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:27,317
Well, you're a long way
from California.

416
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:29,953
Believe me, we're a
long way from anywhere.

417
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:33,256
Like these fellows?
Just rode in?

418
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:41,398
- Hello, gentlemen.
- Ma'am.

419
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:46,303
( softly )
You're not safe.

420
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:48,271
I've tried
to leave this place.

421
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:51,808
Naomi, you gonna sit there
yabbering on my time,

422
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:55,445
head on back, help Mailene
with the washing.

423
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:57,414
Be careful.

424
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:03,253
Hello there, gentlemen.
How are you?

425
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:08,692
Money's no good here, Sheriff.
Abraham's pardoned your expenses.

426
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:19,736
Abraham visited me
this morning.

427
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,342
Was he alone?

428
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:27,677
Yes.

429
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:30,847
<i>What did he want?</i>

430
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:33,250
Nothing.

431
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:36,653
We talked about his wife,
his travels.

432
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:38,788
We talked for hours.

433
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:52,269
What's wrong?

434
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:54,504
Nothing.

435
00:37:56,908 --> 00:38:00,343
I don't like him
coming here, Marisol.

436
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:03,513
What would you have me do?
I'm here on my own.

437
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:06,449
<i>I can't prevent him
from coming.</i>

438
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:17,494
Tomorrow, I think it's best
you come out there with me.

439
00:38:19,031 --> 00:38:21,298
Isaac:
<i>You can stay if you like.</i>

440
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,501
Hoot'll start thinking
I have a boyfriend.

441
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:26,569
Don't worry yourself
about Hoot.

442
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:30,440
What about your father?

443
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:32,409
What about him?

444
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:36,446
You think he knows he's
sharing me with his own son?

445
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:39,582
You think you're something
fucking different

446
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,484
from them other whores
out there?

447
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,054
Do you? You think you're
something fucking special?

448
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:46,022
That it?

449
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:48,692
You fucking Biddie whore.

450
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:52,929
- ( choking )
- What happens between you and me

451
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,864
stays that way.

452
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,399
( gasps )

453
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:58,068
Get the fuck out of here!

454
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:14,751
Headed somewhere?

455
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:17,687
It's a beautiful day
for a ride.

456
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,589
That it is.

457
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:22,759
Thought we might go down and
take a good look at the river.

458
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:29,466
You'll enjoy that.
This is Naomi.

459
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:33,136
But I believe
you two already met.

460
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:38,541
Naomi, this is Marisol.

461
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:41,711
It's a pleasure, ma'am.

462
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:44,833
And you're even more
beautiful than I was told.

463
00:39:47,152 --> 00:39:49,419
Abraham: <i>Just stopped by
to let you know</i>

464
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:51,888
I'll be holding a revival
at the chapel

465
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,524
<i>at 8:00 tomorrow morning.</i>

466
00:39:54,526 --> 00:39:57,861
Naturally, you are more
than welcome to join us.

467
00:39:57,863 --> 00:40:00,430
Thank you, Abraham.
We will consider it.

468
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:04,434
Very well, then.
We'll be on our way.

469
00:40:04,436 --> 00:40:06,403
Enjoy your ride.

470
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,935
David?

471
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,939
Just stay there.

472
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,932
What's wrong?
What's happening?

473
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:18,935
Something's not right.

474
00:42:18,937 --> 00:42:21,971
<i>- ( rain pattering )</i>
- Man:<i> It's my pleasure, ma'am.</i>

475
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:23,973
<i>You take good care now.</i>

476
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,314
I left corn cure
by the bed.

477
00:42:31,316 --> 00:42:34,884
You're going to have to purchase
more from Portence in a day or two.

478
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:36,986
Is it the fever?

479
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:39,956
Bed rest, corn cure.

480
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:42,091
Keep her hydrated.

481
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:43,993
Otherwise,
just leave her be.

482
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:46,596
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

483
00:42:46,598 --> 00:42:48,698
Thank you
for coming, Doctor.

484
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:54,671
He shall bless thy bread
and thy water

485
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:58,675
and He will take sickness
away from the midst of thee.

486
00:42:58,677 --> 00:43:01,010

489
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:55,131
Abraham:
<i>God calls on you</i>

490
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,734
<i>to conquer your fear.</i>

491
00:44:03,842 --> 00:44:06,209
( chanting continues )

492
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:09,412
Unshackle your faith.

493
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:15,385
The serpent is the darkness
inside your soul.

494
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:17,754
Your fear excites it.

495
00:44:19,124 --> 00:44:21,991
Harness that fear

496
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:25,662
and embrace the power
within you.

497
00:44:25,664 --> 00:44:30,433
<i>Fill yourself
with His spirit</i>

498
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:33,670
<i>and I will chase away
your demons.</i>

499
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:37,306
The spirit led you here.

500
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:39,876
You have nothing to fear.

501
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:44,113
Take it.

502
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:46,949
No, please.

503
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:49,052
Take it.

504
00:44:49,054 --> 00:44:51,454
( hissing )

505
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:55,992
Behold...

506
00:44:55,994 --> 00:44:59,395
your faith,

507
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:02,765
even as tiny
as a mustard seed,

<i>can move mountains.</i>

509
00:45:04,836 --> 00:45:09,338
This is the message
from the son of God!

510
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,442
The miracles I do,
you can do also.

511
00:45:12,444 --> 00:45:16,379
<i>The power of God
is within you!</i>

512
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:19,716
All that is required
is that you believe.

513
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:25,455
Let us pray.

514
00:45:25,457 --> 00:45:28,958
<i>Lord, we welcome You
amongst us this morning.</i>

515
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,295
<i>We ask that You
open our hearts...</i>

516
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,800
Whoa, what happened?

517
00:45:37,802 --> 00:45:40,470
Come on. Come on, sit down.
Come sit down.

518
00:45:40,472 --> 00:45:43,840
The Englishman...
he's drunk.

519
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:46,743
I was entertaining him
and then he grabbed his gun

520
00:45:46,745 --> 00:45:48,778
and he tried to put it
inside me and then...

521
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:52,081
Okay, it's all right.
Is he still there?

522
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:55,523
Okay, you don't move from
that chair until I return.

523
00:46:04,229 --> 00:46:06,229
( men laughing )

524
00:46:06,231 --> 00:46:08,464
Which one?

525
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:10,800
- Abraham handles these matters...
- Which fucking one?

526
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:12,401
Blue shirt in the corner.

527
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:20,042
Okay. Okay.

528
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:33,256
Really did a number
on you, Miss Naomi.

529
00:46:33,258 --> 00:46:35,825
Who is he?
And the other two with him?

530
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:40,863
<i>Uh, they'd be guests
of Abraham.</i>

531
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:47,303
Not sure I'm going to have enough
thread to stitch the other fellow.

532
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:54,243
Where is he?

533
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:03,286
You have no idea
what's going on here.

534
00:47:03,288 --> 00:47:05,822
Ah, for this?

535
00:47:05,824 --> 00:47:08,491
She's not worth
a lick or a...

536
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:15,364
Abraham will not
be pleased by this.

537
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:18,000
You run
to your father, then.

538
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:20,203
( cocks gun )

539
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:28,010
My sense is he's taken quite
a shine to me being here.

540
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:29,545
You're mistaken.

541
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:31,581
It's that pretty
bean-eating wife of yours...

542
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,482
( gunshot )

543
00:47:45,463 --> 00:47:47,396
( cocks gun )

544
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:51,000
What are you gonna do?
I ain't heeled.

545
00:47:57,008 --> 00:47:59,375
( groaning )

546
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:09,118
Get him out of here.

547
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,554
( muttering )

548
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:15,024
Get off!

549
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:18,027
Not bad for the son
of a shop clerk.

550
00:48:20,031 --> 00:48:21,530
Show's over, dear friends.

551
00:48:21,532 --> 00:48:25,167
Morris,
please see to Isaac.

552
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,538
I'm taking my wife home.

553
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,674
You see to Naomi.

554
00:48:31,676 --> 00:48:35,144
I'll attend
to her every need.

555
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:47,690
<i>What were you thinking?</i>

556
00:48:47,692 --> 00:48:51,193
"Corn cure and bed rest."

557
00:48:51,195 --> 00:48:54,230
You heard it yourself.
Do you even wish to recover?

558
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:59,335
I never should have
let you come here.

559
00:49:04,242 --> 00:49:07,410
What happened
to that woman?

560
00:49:07,412 --> 00:49:10,246
She was beaten
in the brothel.

561
00:49:13,418 --> 00:49:15,384
Is that why
you were fighting?

562
00:49:21,092 --> 00:49:24,160
Guess that what happens
to pretty whores.

563
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:33,069
- Do you think she's pretty?
- Stop it.

564
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,441
Abraham will take care
of her.

565
00:49:38,443 --> 00:49:40,009
Will he?

566
00:49:40,011 --> 00:49:41,577
He branded
that poor woman

567
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,112
when she tried
to leave this place...

568
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:44,513
- He wouldn't do that...
- Damn it, Marisol!

569
00:49:44,515 --> 00:49:46,415
I saw it myself!

570
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:51,487
Why are you speaking
about him like you know him?

571
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,325
All right.
Hey.

572
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:59,128
Hey, it's all right,
it's all right.

573
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,329
It's all right.

574
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:07,236
<i>- ( piano music playing )</i>
- Isaac:<i> So easily you could have stopped him today.</i>

575
00:50:07,238 --> 00:50:11,540
You stood by
while he beat me.

576
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:14,210
You might have
stopped him yourself.

577
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,615
You tolerate him
for his woman.

578
00:50:19,617 --> 00:50:21,450
She's yours.

579
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:23,786
Take her and let's bury him.

580
00:50:29,093 --> 00:50:31,761
If you could see
yourself...

581
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:37,066
turned weak
over a pretty Mexican.

582
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:41,570
You are
your mother's son.

583
00:50:45,076 --> 00:50:47,610
Are you so ashamed?

584
00:50:47,612 --> 00:50:51,247
Am I not as God
has made me to be?

585
00:50:52,817 --> 00:50:55,484
God, maybe,

586
00:50:55,486 --> 00:50:57,086
but not me.

587
00:51:14,672 --> 00:51:16,272
You go ahead,
gentlemen.

588
00:51:16,274 --> 00:51:19,508
I'll catch up
with you at Hoot's.

589
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,243
Morning.

590
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:25,648
More uninvited guests?

591
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:28,150
<i>( men speaking Chinese )</i>

592
00:51:28,152 --> 00:51:32,188
Fascinating culture,
the Chinese.

593
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:37,326
They say they are
trapped in the Samsara,

594
00:51:37,328 --> 00:51:41,864
ever-changing world
of good and evil.

595
00:51:45,203 --> 00:51:47,837
If they don't take control
of their desires,

596
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,107
they are subject
to great suffering

597
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:54,743
in this life
and the next.

598
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:57,213
I didn't have the heart
to tell them

599
00:51:57,215 --> 00:52:00,583
that heathens be damned
to hell regardless.

600
00:52:02,153 --> 00:52:04,820
What desires could
they possibly find out here?

601
00:52:07,658 --> 00:52:10,392
You're feeling
off-color today.

602
00:52:12,196 --> 00:52:15,197
Short time
I've been here,

603
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:19,435
I've seen Englishmen
and now Chinamen.

604
00:52:19,437 --> 00:52:21,437
Curious, no?

605
00:52:21,439 --> 00:52:26,375
And yet I haven't seen
a single Mexican man or woman.

606
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:28,410
We aren't but a few miles
from Mexico.

607
00:52:28,412 --> 00:52:30,179
Why is that?

608
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:33,215
Perhaps they're scared.

609
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:35,718
Why would they be scared?

610
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:45,394
Because on this side
of the river,

611
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:48,297
they're no longer Mexican.

612
00:52:48,299 --> 00:52:52,168
Not everybody possesses
our sensibilities, David.

613
00:52:57,241 --> 00:53:00,910
There something more you feel the
need to ask me, Sheriff Locke?

614
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,484
I guess it don't matter.

615
00:53:08,486 --> 00:53:11,487
Be leaving soon enough.

616
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:13,656
Will you?

617
00:53:13,658 --> 00:53:16,292
Didn't find
what you were looking for?

618
00:53:16,294 --> 00:53:19,295
As soon as Marisol's fever
breaks, we'll be on our way.

619
00:53:19,297 --> 00:53:21,664
Nowhere particular?

620
00:53:23,234 --> 00:53:28,470
( speaking Latin )

621
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:32,808
What does that mean?

622
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:36,245
"I'll embrace your company
while I have it."

623
00:54:07,245 --> 00:54:09,245
<i>( rain pattering )</i>

624
00:54:30,001 --> 00:54:32,768
How long
have I been asleep?

625
00:54:36,374 --> 00:54:39,441
Most of yesterday
and today.

626
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,932
I saw you
in the river.

627
00:54:55,293 --> 00:54:57,359
It's the fever.

628
00:54:57,361 --> 00:55:00,696
- It's made you delirious.
- You're not listening to me.

629
00:55:00,698 --> 00:55:03,832
There's something
twisting in me.

630
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:06,068
Morris says
just a few days.

631
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:08,771
- Why are you not listening?
- Because you're not thinking straight.

632
00:55:08,773 --> 00:55:13,342
No! I see it all
so clear.

633
00:55:13,344 --> 00:55:16,679
You just took me

634
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:18,080
when he gave me away.

635
00:55:18,082 --> 00:55:21,583
You never asked.

636
00:55:21,585 --> 00:55:24,620
You think I'm crazy,
but I had no say in it.

637
00:55:24,622 --> 00:55:26,755
All I think is that right now
you're not yourself.

638
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:28,857
You're very ill.

639
00:55:31,796 --> 00:55:33,529
I need to see Abraham.

640
00:55:33,531 --> 00:55:35,798
Can you send for him,
please?

641
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,499
- No.
- Please.

642
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,501
He's the only one
that can help us, David.

643
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:42,104
God damn it.
Help with what? How?

644
00:55:42,106 --> 00:55:45,474
<i>You don't know Abraham.
You know me.</i>

645
00:55:45,476 --> 00:55:48,110
And I'm right here.
I can help you.

646
00:55:48,112 --> 00:55:51,013
He's put you in the river,

647
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:52,981
like he did to your father.

648
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:57,586
And you can't hear me.

649
00:55:59,457 --> 00:56:03,392
<i>( frantic pounding

<i>( pounding continues )</i>

651
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:11,367
I'm leaving.

652
00:56:20,478 --> 00:56:24,646
I know you didn't just stumble
into town for no reason.

653
00:56:24,648 --> 00:56:27,383
I can help you, but you
need to come with me.

654
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:28,884
Help me how?
What do you know?

655
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:31,387
Everyone here
knows what happens.

656
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:34,056
And they will kill you
when you least expect it.

657
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:35,557
- Just come in and talk...
- No.

658
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,926
Listen, your wife's
already gone.

659
00:56:37,928 --> 00:56:40,796
- She was gone the moment you brought her here...
- That is enough of that.

660
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:42,865
Okay? I can protect you.
Just talk to me.

661
00:56:42,867 --> 00:56:46,835
I have to go now. Ride to the first
ridge this side of the river.

662
00:56:46,837 --> 00:56:48,971
You'll see what
you're looking for there.

663
00:56:48,973 --> 00:56:51,173
I'll meet you
at the split-fork crossing.

664
00:56:51,175 --> 00:56:53,175
I'll wait there
an hour for you.

665
00:56:53,177 --> 00:56:55,778
Naomi, wh... Naomi!

666
00:56:57,148 --> 00:56:59,415
God damn it.

667
00:57:44,895 --> 00:57:47,496
Three miles?

668
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:09,117
( groaning )

669
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:26,902
Can you help me, please?

670
00:58:26,904 --> 00:58:29,271
I need to see Abraham.

671
00:58:29,273 --> 00:58:30,273
Abraham!

672
00:58:37,114 --> 00:58:40,148
Abraham, help me.
Something's really wrong.

673
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,017
Where is your husband?

674
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:44,553
Last I seen, he was painting
his nose down at Hoot's

675
00:58:44,555 --> 00:58:47,022
with that spud-nigger whore
Naomi.

676
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:02,571
Please, I don't know
what to do.

677
00:59:02,573 --> 00:59:06,975
Silas, see she gets home and stay by
her side until the sheriff returns.

678
00:59:06,977 --> 00:59:10,746
- Ladies, you fetch Dr. Morris.
- Yes.

679
00:59:10,748 --> 00:59:13,248
If you were mine,
Marisol,

680
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:16,685
I'd not leave your side
for anything.

681
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:36,705
Why, I recall,

682
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:40,709
at Bull Run, I led my
militia through a wall

683
00:59:40,711 --> 00:59:45,681
of advancing blue-belly
fire entirely unscathed.

684
00:59:45,683 --> 00:59:48,684
- "How so?" one might ask.
- <i>( door opens )</i>

685
00:59:50,788 --> 00:59:55,657
But, friends, this is
divine conviction at work.

686
00:59:55,659 --> 01:00:00,896
I tell you, we left even
General Lee speechless.

687
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:03,665
- ( men murmuring )
- You met General Lee?

688
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:09,371
Oh, it was a magnificent day
to behold.

689
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:13,075
My men killed
more Yankee malefactor

690
01:00:13,077 --> 01:00:18,280
than that milksop Bedford
Forrest's entire regiment.

691
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:23,251
I believe he referred to us
as his "Hangman Militia."

692
01:00:23,253 --> 01:00:25,787
( men laughing )

693
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:35,030
Did you kill
many men, Abraham?

694
01:00:39,336 --> 01:00:43,238
The faces of those
we've killed

695
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,074
remains hidden

696
01:00:46,076 --> 01:00:48,777
behind our eyes

697
01:00:48,779 --> 01:00:52,981
and our memory
for eternity,

698
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,283
without change.

699
01:00:58,222 --> 01:01:01,256
There's no labor
in killing a man.

700
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:04,793
But for some, it's living
after that's work.

701
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:09,831
You carry
the burden of many.

702
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:12,734
So should you.

703
01:01:12,736 --> 01:01:15,904
<i>Mrs. Naomi Ellis,

My reflection
is murderous,

706
01:01:27,151 --> 01:01:28,417
but my conscience
is clean.

You're leaving me again.

719

I saw something
yesterday, Marisol.

720

We're leaving tonight.

803
01:14:44,547 --> 01:14:46,614
Someone.

804
01:14:46,616 --> 01:14:51,085
We wanted to know what it
felt like to kill someone.

805
01:14:52,856 --> 01:14:55,823
Well, I'm gonna
let you kill.

806
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:58,526
And I ain't even
gonna charge you for it.

807
01:15:09,772 --> 01:15:12,640
You're gonna pick up
that pistol

808
01:15:12,642 --> 01:15:16,277
and shoot Monte
in his ugly fucking face...

809
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:20,581
or I'm gonna
shoot your father dead.

810
01:15:25,054 --> 01:15:26,888
In fact, go on
and shoot Dale, too.

811
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:28,990
I don't much
like his face either.

812
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:33,294
<i>( man crying )</i>

813
01:15:33,296 --> 01:15:35,696
Pick up the pistol,
killer.

814
01:15:39,769 --> 01:15:42,003
Pick it up!

815
01:15:54,684 --> 01:15:56,717
Don't do it, John.

816
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,586
<i>Come on, son.</i>

817
01:15:58,588 --> 01:16:01,589
Come on, he...
he's fooling with you, John.

818
01:16:03,826 --> 01:16:06,561
- Please.
- One!

819
01:16:12,669 --> 01:16:14,835
<i>( gun clicking )</i>

820
01:16:30,253 --> 01:16:32,587

( crying )

822
01:16:45,201 --> 01:16:48,336
You say one word and I'll
blow your fucking head off.

823
01:17:01,884 --> 01:17:03,618
Where is my wife?

824
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:10,825
Where she belongs.

825
01:17:14,831 --> 01:17:19,033
You can go right ahead and put that
old coach gun down now, mister.

826
01:17:19,035 --> 01:17:21,869
Aw, I figure I won't.

827
01:17:21,871 --> 01:17:24,205
It's all right, boys.

828
01:17:24,207 --> 01:17:28,743
I feel Mr. Kingston is due
a modicum of self-expression

829
01:17:28,745 --> 01:17:31,112
<i>under the circumstances.</i>

830
01:17:31,114 --> 01:17:34,148
Kingston?

831
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:38,753
I've known for quite some time
you'd be coming for me, David.

832
01:17:38,755 --> 01:17:43,190
I took pleasure
in killing your father.

833
01:17:43,192 --> 01:17:46,394
He was an abhorrent man.

834
01:17:48,064 --> 01:17:50,431
If you think I'm here
to avenge my father,

835
01:17:50,433 --> 01:17:53,167
you think too highly
of yourself.

836
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:57,171
<i>You're nothing more to me
than youthful intrigue.</i>

837
01:17:58,274 --> 01:17:59,774
I'm a Texas ranger.

838
01:17:59,776 --> 01:18:01,242
I was sent
by the governor himself.

839
01:18:01,244 --> 01:18:04,111
All those Mexicans
you've been killing

840
01:18:04,113 --> 01:18:06,681
<i>been floating into a strainer
a couple miles downriver.</i>

841
01:18:06,683 --> 01:18:09,917
<i>One was General Calderon's
own nephew.</i>

842
01:18:17,126 --> 01:18:19,460
Well, I must say

843
01:18:19,462 --> 01:18:24,131
all this news
is shocking, David.

844
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:29,437
Though it seems you have
some bad information.

845
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:32,139
<i>You see,
we bury the bodies.</i>

846
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:36,277
Mexicans,
shit that they are,

847
01:18:36,279 --> 01:18:39,380
<i>decompose rather quickly.</i>

848
01:18:39,382 --> 01:18:43,117
How dirty did you get
that shovel today, Isaac?

849
01:18:47,423 --> 01:18:50,157
Don't listen to him, Father.
You're a fucking liar.

850
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,393
I followed you today,
you piece of shit.

851
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:55,129
How long you think before
they find that scalpless girl

852
01:18:55,131 --> 01:18:56,731
<i>you dumped in the river?</i>

853
01:18:58,267 --> 01:19:00,501
Father, I...
I can explain.

854
01:19:00,503 --> 01:19:03,938
Father, can't you...
can't you see what he's doing?

855
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:06,207
I tell you, he's...
he's lying.

856
01:19:06,209 --> 01:19:10,311
You are as crippled
as your mother was.

857
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:22,123
( sighs )

858
01:19:22,125 --> 01:19:26,927
I suppose I'll have to
try again with the new wife.

859
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:30,297
I'll shoot you dead before
you ever touch her again.

860
01:19:30,299 --> 01:19:35,136
I have to say, as much as I
respect your confidence, David,

861
01:19:35,138 --> 01:19:38,305
I also respect when a man
can appreciate

862
01:19:38,307 --> 01:19:40,908
his fate staring him
in the face.

863
01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:44,478
You have Hoot's rifle
pointing at your head, son.

864
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:48,015
I figure I'm a better
shot than Hoot.

865
01:20:07,069 --> 01:20:10,337
Your pugnacious pappy
would have loved to hear that.

866
01:20:10,339 --> 01:20:13,073
- Abraham?
- I say he's bluffing.

867
01:20:13,075 --> 01:20:16,210
- Father, may I have a moment?
- No!

868
01:20:25,087 --> 01:20:26,987
Isaac:
<i>David Kingston...</i>

869
01:20:29,592 --> 01:20:34,261
I challenge you
to fight me to the death

870
01:20:34,263 --> 01:20:36,964
in a Helena duel.

871
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:46,173
My boy.

872
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:50,044
Let me do this, Pa.

873
01:20:58,421 --> 01:21:00,921
Let me help you up, son.

874
01:21:04,327 --> 01:21:06,260
David?

875
01:21:09,265 --> 01:21:11,465
I'll do it
on one condition.

876
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:16,403
When it's done,
my wife leaves here with me.

877
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:21,575
Put your guns away,
gentlemen.

878
01:21:21,577 --> 01:21:24,311
<i>There'll be
no more shooting today.</i>

879
01:21:36,259 --> 01:21:39,627
Abraham:
We'll meet outside, 8:00.

880
01:21:52,942 --> 01:21:56,577
Abraham:
<i>Good people of Mount Hermon,</i>

881
01:21:56,579 --> 01:22:01,181
<i>you're about to witness
a Helena duel.</i>

882
01:22:01,183 --> 01:22:03,517
Mr. Kingston.

883
01:22:09,058 --> 01:22:12,126
A most noble affair

884
01:22:12,128 --> 01:22:14,194
of character and honor.

885
01:22:16,232 --> 01:22:21,402
I took David's father
with this knife

886
01:22:21,404 --> 01:22:24,238
over 20 years ago.

887
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:27,174
The one he now grips
is stained with my blood

888
01:22:27,176 --> 01:22:30,144
from that same duel

889
01:22:30,146 --> 01:22:34,949
and now will surely
drip red with my son's.

890
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,621
<i>If Isaac lives,</i>

891
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:44,992
he will be forgiven
his ill-considered behavior

892
01:22:44,994 --> 01:22:47,494
and he will undoubtedly
be the better man

893
01:22:47,496 --> 01:22:50,230
for what he experiences
here tonight.

894
01:22:52,568 --> 01:22:54,969
Does me proud.

895
01:22:57,974 --> 01:23:00,140
If David is victor,

896
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:04,378
<i>then in fairness,
he will be taken to his wife</i>

897
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:07,081
and she will decide
their fate.

898
01:23:07,083 --> 01:23:11,085
On this, you have my word.
Gentlemen, come together.

899
01:23:17,593 --> 01:23:20,494
You shall pour out
each other's blood...

900
01:23:22,198 --> 01:23:25,132
and we will cover it
with dust.

901
01:23:41,717 --> 01:23:43,117
Begin.

902
01:23:51,427 --> 01:23:53,761
( groans )

903
01:24:05,307 --> 01:24:07,775
- ( stabbing )
- Ah!

01:24:15,818 --> 01:24:18,819
<i>( blood flowing )</i>

905
01:24:56,158 --> 01:24:58,192
- Marisol?
- Shh.

906
01:25:00,496 --> 01:25:04,631
You'll pull your stitches out
and bleed everywhere.

907
01:25:07,703 --> 01:25:09,703
We can go home now.

908
01:25:25,588 --> 01:25:29,790
Abraham: <i>"Dark eyes burning,
in the night they glow.</i>

909
01:25:29,792 --> 01:25:32,693
<i>She knows only yearning.</i>

910
01:25:32,695 --> 01:25:35,829
<i>What else is there
to know?"</i>

911
01:25:35,831 --> 01:25:38,599
That's beautiful, David.

912
01:25:40,636 --> 01:25:43,704
And that's a lovely drawing.

913
01:25:43,706 --> 01:25:46,740
You are one surprise
after another.

914
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:54,548
You've been busy
when no one was watching.

915
01:25:57,386 --> 01:25:59,653
Thank you for sharing,
Marisol.

916
01:26:01,457 --> 01:26:03,624
He wanted us to escape.

917
01:26:03,626 --> 01:26:06,260
Abraham:
<i>Did he, now?</i>

918
01:26:06,262 --> 01:26:12,232
Well, we're going to give you
that chance, David.

919
01:26:12,234 --> 01:26:15,169
These three men have yet
to experience

920
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:17,304
the thrill of the hunt.

921
01:26:17,306 --> 01:26:22,543
I've decided to afford them
this one unique opportunity.

922
01:26:22,545 --> 01:26:24,578
<i>Obviously,
you're disadvantaged,</i>

923
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:26,880
so we'll give you
till first light tomorrow.

924
01:26:26,882 --> 01:26:29,716
The time until then
is yours.

<i>I've given you a rifle and a

Please get him
dressed and fed.

Please put this on.

Marisol?

931
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:13,260
Why are you doing this?

932
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:24,271
Marisol?

How do you know he
would've come this way?

949

I've known where this boy's
been headed his entire life.

950
01:32:33,081 --> 01:32:35,315
He was wounded something
fierce from the fight.

951
01:32:35,317 --> 01:32:37,684
Probably dead
anyway.

952
01:32:37,686 --> 01:32:41,788
I assure you,
gentlemen, he is not.

01:33:18,594 --> 01:33:22,362
- ( gunshot )
- ( horses neighing )

962
01:33:22,364 --> 01:33:23,930
Shit!
There goes the horses.

963
01:33:23,932 --> 01:33:26,166
We gotta go back.
We can't stay here.

964
01:33:26,168 --> 01:33:28,735
Please,
I... I can't fight.

965
01:33:28,737 --> 01:33:30,203
I can't... I...

966
01:33:30,205 --> 01:33:32,205
( gagging )

967
01:33:32,207 --> 01:33:34,107
( fires )

968
01:33:39,381 --> 01:33:41,247
( fires )

969
01:33:53,028 --> 01:33:54,761
( sighs )

970
01:35:10,939 --> 01:35:12,338
( fires )

971
01:35:32,127 --> 01:35:34,294
( groans )

972
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:58,818
Oh! Ah!

973
01:36:00,188 --> 01:36:02,222
Ah!

974
01:36:47,903 --> 01:36:50,303
( groaning )

975
01:37:13,829 --> 01:37:15,929
Ah, fuck.

976
01:37:28,376 --> 01:37:29,909
( grunting )

977
01:37:48,096 --> 01:37:49,295
( sighs )

978
01:37:49,297 --> 01:37:51,030
<i>( high-pitched ringing )</i>

979
01:37:51,032 --> 01:37:54,267
( groaning )

980
01:38:05,113 --> 01:38:07,413
( groaning )

981
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:37,577
( gun cocks )

982
01:38:37,579 --> 01:38:40,146
I'm guessing
you didn't foresee this.

983
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:01,100
( grunts )

984
01:39:01,102 --> 01:39:06,439
You should thank me
for taking your father.

985
01:39:06,441 --> 01:39:10,677
<i>You were born that day.</i>

986
01:39:10,679 --> 01:39:15,982
<i>If he raised you, you would
not be the man you've become.</i>

987
01:39:15,984 --> 01:39:21,955
Our entire lives spent
denying death its dominion.

988
01:39:21,957 --> 01:39:24,390
<i>Seems its answer
for us will be...</i>

989
01:39:24,392 --> 01:39:27,226
painful and slow.

990
01:39:28,663 --> 01:39:32,131
We deserve it
for all we've done.

991
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:36,736
Futile to toil
over such things.

992
01:39:36,738 --> 01:39:39,572
Forces you
to look inward

993
01:39:39,574 --> 01:39:44,410
and examine
the monster you truly are.

994
01:39:46,181 --> 01:39:49,248
Don't go exempting
yourself.

995
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:52,418
You'll answer the same
as everyone else.

996
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:54,654
David, I was never born

997
01:39:54,656 --> 01:39:58,591
nor will I ever truly die.

998
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:02,595
Aw, you'll die, all right.

999
01:40:02,597 --> 01:40:05,231
You'll die right here.

1000
01:40:06,434 --> 01:40:09,002
Your leg will swell.

1001
01:40:09,004 --> 01:40:12,538
You'll scream and try to kill
yourself to save the pain.

1002
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:15,008
<i>The stench will lead them
to our bodies in a week</i>

1003
01:40:15,010 --> 01:40:17,276
<i>and this scene will show
what I have made of you.</i>

1004
01:40:18,646 --> 01:40:21,748
Word will spread
of your death.

1005
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:24,784
They'll hiss your name,
call you a murderous son of a bitch

1006
01:40:24,786 --> 01:40:26,552
and a fraud.

1007
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:36,029
The only thing
they'll remember of you

1008
01:40:36,031 --> 01:40:38,131
will be me.

1009
01:40:39,801 --> 01:40:43,202
( chuckling )

1010
01:40:52,547 --> 01:40:55,081
( grunting )

1011
01:41:06,194 --> 01:41:08,261
( screeching )

1012
01:41:15,236 --> 01:41:17,804
( exhales )

1013
01:41:58,179 --> 01:41:59,579
<i>( stabbing echoes )</i>

1014
01:41:59,581 --> 01:42:02,215
<i>( distant shouting )</i>

1015
01:42:07,355 --> 01:42:09,322
<i>( bird screeching )</i>

1016
01:42:09,324 --> 01:42:11,757
( stabbing, grunting )

1017
01:42:14,429 --> 01:42:17,296
- ( stabbing )
- ( men shouting )

1018
01:42:19,767 --> 01:42:22,135
( stabbing )

1019
01:42:30,445 --> 01:42:32,812
Men:
Get him! Get him!

1020
01:42:35,383 --> 01:42:36,782
Yes!

1021
01:43:03,444 --> 01:43:05,411
Abraham:
<i>I made you.</i>

1022
01:43:06,581 --> 01:43:08,814
And so I end you.

1023
01:43:08,816 --> 01:43:11,350
( gunshot )

1024
01:43:50,925 --> 01:43:53,459
Calderon: You did send your rangers
out to the town

1025
01:43:53,461 --> 01:43:55,695
to corroborate the stories
that my niece gave you

1026
01:43:55,697 --> 01:43:57,630
along with the prisoners?

1027
01:43:57,632 --> 01:44:00,399
The... the town
was abandoned.

1028
01:44:00,401 --> 01:44:02,335
And the prison?

1029
01:44:02,337 --> 01:44:05,304
It doesn't appear
to exist.

1030
01:44:07,875 --> 01:44:11,277
<i>Did your niece
say anything else</i>

1031
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:15,748
<i>regarding David Kingston
or his wife?</i>

1032
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:18,684
Calderon: <i>She said he was badly wounded
when he freed the prisoners</i>

1033
01:44:18,686 --> 01:44:23,289
<i>and he rode out
into the brush alone,</i>

1034
01:44:23,291 --> 01:44:25,891
<i>never to be seen again.</i>

1035
01:44:25,893 --> 01:44:28,461
<i>But she made no mention
of a woman.</i>

1036
01:44:29,964 --> 01:44:32,365
Perhaps you will allow me
a small detail

1037
01:44:32,367 --> 01:44:33,833
<i>to go out
and search for him.</i>

1038
01:44:33,835 --> 01:44:36,469
I don't think so, General.

1039
01:44:36,471 --> 01:44:40,640
He rode off into the brush
for a reason.

1040
01:44:40,642 --> 01:44:44,577
<i>If he wants to,
he'll ride back out again.</i>

1041
01:45:36,364 --> 01:45:38,597
<i>( music playing )</i>
