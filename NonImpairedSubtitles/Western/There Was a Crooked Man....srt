1
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,249
<i>Once upon a time,</i>
<i>when rivers ran blue...</i>

2
00:00:11,427 --> 00:00:15,677
<i>...and the air in the valley</i>
<i>was sweet and clean...</i>

3
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:15,438
Lord, for what we are about to receive...

4
00:04:15,538 --> 00:04:19,108
...make us properly grateful. Amen.
- Amen.

5
00:04:33,422 --> 00:04:37,927
Nothing like fried chicken
while it's still hot and crispy.

6
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,630
The quicker you open that safe
and give us the money...

7
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,866
...the quicker you can get back
to that tasty-looking chicken.

8
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:45,435
Safe?

9
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:49,870
You're mistaken, son.
There's no safe in this house.

10
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,879
Excuse me, ma'am.

11
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,922
Wayne, you'd better do like he says.

12
00:05:06,022 --> 00:05:09,225
A man works like a nigger all his life
to get ahead.

13
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:13,660
Some bastard just comes along
and takes it from him.

14
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:21,137
It's just a few pennies I put aside
for a rainy day.

15
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:24,892
You got enough there for a flood,
Mr. Lomax.

16
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,930
Damn. Must be a million dollars.

17
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:34,481
Mrs. Lomax.

18
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:38,955
Saddlebag isn't gonna be big enough.

19
00:05:39,055 --> 00:05:41,945
Well, Hobbs, get something bigger.

20
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,444
It just ain't the same when it gets cold.

21
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:52,132
Is this all right?

22
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:54,335
Those were my mother's.

23
00:05:54,337 --> 00:05:57,737
Must have been a fine figure of a woman.

24
00:05:58,874 --> 00:06:01,509
Don't feel so bad, Mr. Lomax...

25
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:08,693
...you got rich once, you can do it again.
Think of it as a kind of a challenge.

26
00:06:09,018 --> 00:06:11,018
That's all of it.

27
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:20,556
I do hate to eat and run like this.

28
00:07:03,372 --> 00:07:07,367
What are you doing here?
Get out there and help.

29
00:07:11,414 --> 00:07:16,684
You ain't gonna get your ass shot off
for no white man's money.

30
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:49,011
Come on, upsy-daisy, girls.
Come on, girls. Look lively.

31
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,321
Come on, now. Brighten up.

32
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:02,825
Why, look who's here.
- Good evening, Goldie.

33
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:05,361
Oh, you poor man, you're all wet.

34
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:10,051
And drunk.
- Well, come on in. You'll catch your death.

35
00:09:21,944 --> 00:09:24,180
I got no business here, Goldie.

36
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,582
Being, as you know, cleaned out.

37
00:09:26,682 --> 00:09:30,786
Oh, honey, we all heard about that.
It's just terrible, just terrible.

38
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:34,557
I thought if I could just sit down for a while.

39
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,660
Oh, why, sure.
An old customer like you...

40
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,010
Friday nights just ain't been the same
without you.

41
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:45,022
All that money.

42
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:48,328
It's just hell.

43
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,504
Even my poor parrot.

44
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:54,276
He's gone clean out of his mind
since that night.

45
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:58,247
Oh, honey, you'll be back on your feet
before long.

46
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,082
Look, I tell you what.

47
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:06,132
How would you like to go upstairs
and have a look through the peephole?

48
00:10:06,622 --> 00:10:09,191
But-- But doesn't that cost
almost as much as--?

49
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:12,021
We'll put it on the house.

50
00:10:29,512 --> 00:10:32,913
Evening, Wayne.
- Evening, judge.

51
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:43,147
You're late. Just missed the fireworks.

52
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:32,906
By God.

53
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,605
By God!

54
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:37,313
It's him!

55
00:11:37,413 --> 00:11:40,576
By God, it's him!

56
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:42,749
It's him!

57
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:45,581
By God, it's him!

58
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:48,655
It's him!

59
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,291
It's him!

60
00:11:51,594 --> 00:11:53,594
It's him!

61
00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:57,889
By God, it's him!

62
00:12:04,406 --> 00:12:09,166
Society has got to be protected
against the likes of you.

63
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:13,849
Paris Pitman Jr., having been
found guilty of armed robbery...

64
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:19,389
...you're hereby sentenced to 10 years
in the territorial prison.

65
00:13:09,171 --> 00:13:12,074
This time I caught you, you little bastard!
- This time?

66
00:13:12,174 --> 00:13:14,577
You all through
messing around with my daughter.

67
00:13:14,677 --> 00:13:18,280
I told her what I was gonna do.
By God, this time I'm gonna do it!

68
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,845
Daddy, thank God you came in.

69
00:13:21,016 --> 00:13:23,052
But I just met her tonight. Tell him!

70
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:25,152
Bull.

71
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,102
It was the Good Friday of 1873.

72
00:13:40,202 --> 00:13:43,069
I was asleep in my sinner's bed.

73
00:13:44,206 --> 00:13:46,731
Not alone, I gotta admit.

74
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:52,706
And suddenly,
a bolt of lightning struck the air!

75
00:13:52,881 --> 00:13:56,366
And a strange white light filled my room.

76
00:13:56,685 --> 00:14:00,644
And I heard the voice of our blessed Lord.

77
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,359
And he said:

78
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:05,459
'Cyrus.'

79
00:14:05,794 --> 00:14:07,794
And I said:

80
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,230
'That's me, Lord.'

81
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:15,369
And he said,
'I want you to do my work.'

82
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,869
And I fell to my knees and cried:

83
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,369
'What shall I do, Lord?'

84
00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:24,380
And he said:

85
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,685
'From this minute on, you're gonna preach
the gospel of holding out a helping hand...

86
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:33,100
...to the less fortunate in our midst.'

87
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,094
Good people of Deuteronomy...

88
00:14:40,362 --> 00:14:44,782
...how many of you here today
count your blessings...

89
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:47,836
...because you or your loved ones
are not deprived...

90
00:14:47,936 --> 00:14:51,736
...of two or more of your natural senses?

91
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,450
Dudley.

92
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:07,721
Dudley!

93
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:13,929
As you see, poor Dudley
cannot hear a word I say.

94
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:16,759
He must read my lips.

95
00:15:19,568 --> 00:15:25,165
Dudley, go to the easel.

96
00:15:30,646 --> 00:15:36,915
Folks, keep your eyes on this poor man
with the mind of a backward boy.

97
00:15:37,085 --> 00:15:39,688
He cannot utter the simplest word.

98
00:15:39,788 --> 00:15:42,357
He cannot hear the loudest sound.

99
00:15:42,457 --> 00:15:48,020
Dudley there was born a mongolian idiot.

100
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:52,702
A common mule had more reason
for being in this world.

101
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:55,967
But the hand of Providence...

102
00:15:56,104 --> 00:16:00,666
...guided this stray lamb
to the Calvary Mission...

103
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:05,041
...where his remarkable talents
began to blossom.

104
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,214
Thank you, ma'am.

105
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,195
Bless you, ma'am. Thank you, sir.

106
00:16:23,665 --> 00:16:28,255
Thank you, sir.
Every little offering helps. Thank you.

107
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:34,476
I thank you, friends, I thank you.

108
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:40,696
Your unbounded generosity will be known
all the way to Racine, Wisconsin.

109
00:16:40,716 --> 00:16:42,651
In gratitude for your kindness...

110
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,953
...the Calvary Mission
for the deaf and dumb...

111
00:16:45,053 --> 00:16:46,989
...would like to present to you...

112
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:52,127
...Dudley's beautiful rendition
of Moses and the burning bush.

113
00:16:52,227 --> 00:16:56,765
And I take great pleasure in handing over
this inspirational subject...

114
00:16:56,865 --> 00:17:01,325
...on your behalf
to United States Marshal Johnson.

115
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,106
Jumping Jesus, my heinie!

116
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:10,075
My heinie's on fire!

117
00:17:11,213 --> 00:17:13,213
My heinie's on fire!

118
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,062
You sleep late.
- I work late.

119
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:13,239
That's why I'm here.

120
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:17,980
Make it easy on yourself.
If you stay in town, I'll have to arrest you.

121
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,116
There'll be a trial, you'll get six months.
I guarantee it.

122
00:18:21,216 --> 00:18:25,721
On the other hand,
I'll give you two hours to get out.

123
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:29,956
Sheriff.

124
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:34,944
Maybe we could talk this over.

125
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:38,127
Now you've got one hour.

126
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:49,778
<i>Herr Sheriff. <i>Herr</i> Sheriff. Robbed. </i>

127
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,381
Robbed, I just got. In broad daylight.

128
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:55,143
Who did it?
- Robber, who else?

129
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:57,581
He went into the saloon.

130
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:08,161
Floyd Moon.

131
00:19:13,702 --> 00:19:17,572
Floyd, you're in a little trouble.
Don't make it worse.

132
00:19:17,672 --> 00:19:19,672
Give me your gun.

133
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:35,929
Come on, Floyd. Hand over your gun.

134
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:41,466
Your gun, Floyd.
I want you to give it to me.

135
00:19:41,797 --> 00:19:45,563
Sure, sheriff. Anything you say.

136
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:06,579
All right, out.

137
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:19,392
Get out of there!

138
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:33,961
All right, one, two, three,
four, five, six, follow me.

139
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,552
Welcome to the territorial prison,
gentlemen.

140
00:22:17,652 --> 00:22:20,255
I shall assume
we all have one thing in common:

141
00:22:20,355 --> 00:22:23,160
A burning desire to be elsewhere.

142
00:22:23,758 --> 00:22:25,594
But we're not.

143
00:22:25,694 --> 00:22:28,864
My name is Francis E. LeGoff.
I'm your warden.

144
00:22:28,964 --> 00:22:32,834
None of you has been particularly adept
at living according to the rules...

145
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:36,529
...on the outside. You'll do better here.

146
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:44,043
Yes?
- He's just got phlegm, Your Honor.

147
00:22:47,515 --> 00:22:52,179
The rules then: No singing, no whistling.

148
00:22:52,354 --> 00:22:55,357
Any man who can walk
works on the rock pile.

149
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:59,622
All prisoners are required
to attend the hangings.

150
00:23:00,395 --> 00:23:02,395
Coy Cavendish.

151
00:23:03,098 --> 00:23:05,098
Yes, sir?

152
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,869
The date for your hanging
has not yet been set.

153
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,689
In the meantime, obey the rules.

154
00:23:10,905 --> 00:23:12,905
Yes, sir.

155
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,573
Which one is Paris Pitman?

156
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:20,246
Junior?

157
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,550
Junior.

158
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:27,403
They're ready for you, warden.

159
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,664
Right this way, gents.

160
00:23:44,105 --> 00:23:48,701
Is everybody here?
One, two, three, four, five, six.

161
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:50,877
Over here!

162
00:23:51,813 --> 00:23:55,214
That's it. Now, just follow me.

163
00:24:27,782 --> 00:24:30,418
Looks like you boys
are gonna be cellmates.

164
00:24:30,518 --> 00:24:33,021
Got a nice, big cell for you.
Only one feller in it.

165
00:24:33,121 --> 00:24:34,422
What's he like?

166
00:24:34,522 --> 00:24:37,292
He's the Missouri Kid.
- The Missouri Kid?

167
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,728
One of the greatest train robbers
that ever lived.

168
00:24:39,828 --> 00:24:42,931
One of the greatest.
- There must've been a hell of a bounty.

169
00:24:43,031 --> 00:24:45,031
One of the biggest.

170
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,090
How do you do there?

171
00:25:13,995 --> 00:25:15,995
You can call me Kid.

172
00:25:16,197 --> 00:25:19,564
All right, Kid. My name's Paris.

173
00:25:20,635 --> 00:25:24,715
This one here's mine.
You're welcome to the rest.

174
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,778
Get out of that bed, Dudley.
You know I gotta sleep low.

175
00:25:29,878 --> 00:25:32,414
Finders, keepers. You take the top one.

176
00:25:32,514 --> 00:25:35,750
Now, you know I got a bad heart.
I'm not allowed to do any climbing.

177
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:38,153
Horse manure.
There's nothing wrong with you.

178
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:42,078
I said, I got a bad heart,
you son of a bitch!

179
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,787
You fat-ass old bully.

180
00:25:51,866 --> 00:25:53,468
Hey, Kid...

181
00:25:53,568 --> 00:25:57,402
...you been here a long time?
- Always.

182
00:25:58,206 --> 00:26:01,369
Hey, you must be that Chinaman.

183
00:26:01,543 --> 00:26:05,947
I heard tell he wrung the neck off
some other Chink in a railway gang.

184
00:26:06,047 --> 00:26:09,417
If it was a white man,
they'd have strung him up on the spot.

185
00:26:09,517 --> 00:26:11,517
What about you?

186
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:18,324
I-- I pulled three years.

187
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:21,053
What about you, son?
- Two.

188
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:24,099
Because he cried in front of the judge.

189
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:26,668
You should've seen him
sniveling like a street whore.

190
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:30,572
Fish piss. If it hadn't been for me,
you'd have got more, fraud.

191
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:35,517
You must know an awful lot
about what goes on here, I bet.

192
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,281
Excuse me. Where's the gents'?

193
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:42,440
He's got his foot on it.

194
00:26:45,587 --> 00:26:49,391
I say, you must know an awful lot
about what goes on here.

195
00:26:49,491 --> 00:26:52,694
You ain't pulled much time
in the pokey, have you, son?

196
00:26:52,794 --> 00:26:56,279
If you want something, you'll pay for it.

197
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,223
I'll pay my way.

198
00:26:59,467 --> 00:27:01,526
Hey, Tobaccy!

199
00:27:02,237 --> 00:27:05,573
Listen, every spindle in this place
has a dodger game.

200
00:27:05,673 --> 00:27:09,844
This one here is Tobaccy.
He sells you, like, cigarettes and plug.

201
00:27:09,944 --> 00:27:12,847
Another one is Whiskey.
And then there's Sweets.

202
00:27:12,947 --> 00:27:17,282
You ain't got a fella here
named Poontang, have you?

203
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,089
Yeah?
- What's the going rate?

204
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:26,977
Five tailor-mades for a dollar.
- Go and pay the man.

205
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,628
All right. Start asking.

206
00:27:41,142 --> 00:27:43,278
How many ever bust out of here?

207
00:27:43,378 --> 00:27:46,748
Now, don't ponder on that,
it'll just weaken your mind.

208
00:27:46,848 --> 00:27:48,616
How many?

209
00:27:48,716 --> 00:27:52,031
Well, none that lived to tell about it.

210
00:27:52,387 --> 00:27:55,790
What time do they change the guards?
And where?

211
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,827
It's always different times
and different places.

212
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:03,262
And it's never all at once.
They don't miss a trick.

213
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:11,285
Those on the front gate,
always the same number on top? Below?

214
00:28:11,506 --> 00:28:15,943
Believe me, sooner or later
you're gonna give up.

215
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,625
Son, let me tell you something.

216
00:28:40,268 --> 00:28:43,243
It'll help you make your time here.

217
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:47,001
About 25 years ago...

218
00:28:47,575 --> 00:28:52,706
...when I seen I wasn't ever
gonna get out of this place...

219
00:28:54,082 --> 00:28:58,314
...I said to myself, 'Kid,' I said:

220
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:03,923
'Kid, you better figure out some way
to keep from going cuckoo.'

221
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:09,924
Well, you know,
I tried this and I tried that.

222
00:29:10,431 --> 00:29:16,427
And then one day, like, sudden-like,
it come to me.

223
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:19,674
A way to bust out of here.

224
00:29:19,774 --> 00:29:23,767
No. There ain't no way out.

225
00:29:24,112 --> 00:29:29,982
No, listen. I thunk me up a farm.

226
00:29:30,385 --> 00:29:32,053
I mean, not a big place, it--

227
00:29:32,153 --> 00:29:37,591
There's no more than 25 acres,
but it's real good land.

228
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,423
And now when things get too tough
around here for me...

229
00:29:42,797 --> 00:29:45,459
...I just close my eyes...

230
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,407
...and I farm that land.

231
00:29:49,237 --> 00:29:52,297
Well, anyway, I was thinking, son...

232
00:29:52,607 --> 00:29:58,780
...if you was to get yourself--
Get yourself a farm, a store or something...

233
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,535
...why, it would help you to pass the time.

234
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:06,654
It'd give you something--
Give you something to think about.

235
00:30:06,754 --> 00:30:11,214
Thanks, Kid,
but I got something to think about.

236
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:24,866
All right, get to work!

237
00:30:27,442 --> 00:30:29,672
Hey, hey, come on!

238
00:30:31,312 --> 00:30:33,712
Chop, chop, chop.

239
00:31:02,176 --> 00:31:05,913
We thought some little, bitty ones
might come in handy.

240
00:31:06,013 --> 00:31:09,550
You see, there's this shoulder wound
I got at Gettysburg.

241
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,743
I was just a kid.

242
00:31:16,724 --> 00:31:18,559
Name.
- Cavendish.

243
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:20,659
First name.
- Coy.

244
00:31:20,762 --> 00:31:22,497
Coy.

245
00:31:22,597 --> 00:31:25,099
Maybe we can find
something easier for you to do.

246
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:27,724
Let's talk about it sometime.

247
00:31:34,075 --> 00:31:38,603
Hey! Hey! Come on! Hit it! Hey, hey!

248
00:31:39,046 --> 00:31:41,046
Hit it!

249
00:32:20,888 --> 00:32:24,373
Oh, my God, how will I live through this?

250
00:32:25,092 --> 00:32:29,197
I've got the chilblains all over.
I can feel my consumption coming back.

251
00:32:29,297 --> 00:32:31,766
The one you caught at Gettysburg?

252
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,367
How can you eat that?

253
00:32:33,467 --> 00:32:35,594
Oh, this ain't that bad.

254
00:32:35,937 --> 00:32:37,572
It ain't as good as my cooking.

255
00:32:37,672 --> 00:32:40,641
It'll be a long time
before you get anything that good again.

256
00:32:40,741 --> 00:32:43,244
You got some gall to talk like that.

257
00:32:43,344 --> 00:32:46,147
If you hadn't backed your butt
into that stove...

258
00:32:46,247 --> 00:32:48,716
You put me here,
just like you'll be the death of me!

259
00:32:48,816 --> 00:32:51,419
Fish piss.
It's no one's fault we're here but yours.

260
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,555
If you'd have listened,
we could've had a nice little house...

261
00:32:54,655 --> 00:32:58,226
...you could've got a decent job and gone
to work the way that other men do.

262
00:32:58,326 --> 00:33:01,229
I'd have cooked and cleaned
and worked my fingers to the bone.

263
00:33:01,329 --> 00:33:05,333
But, oh, no, no, no. That wasn't
good enough for you, Mr. Big-Ideas.

264
00:33:05,433 --> 00:33:09,270
'Just one more dodge.
Make a million. Easy money.'

265
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:12,273
Everything I did, I was only thinking of us.
- Lies.

266
00:33:12,373 --> 00:33:16,368
Of you!
- Lies, lies, lies. Just a pack of lies.

267
00:33:17,011 --> 00:33:18,946
I'm coming down with something.
- Yeah.

268
00:33:19,046 --> 00:33:20,715
Consumption, I tell you.
- Yeah.

269
00:33:20,815 --> 00:33:23,651
My lungs are gonna go ahead of my heart.
- Have consumption.

270
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:27,236
I don't care what part of you goes first.

271
00:33:36,964 --> 00:33:39,400
Your name Paris Pitman?
- Yeah.

272
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,593
Junior?
- That's me.

273
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,103
Hey.

274
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:49,600
Hey, now, hold it.
Now, what's the trouble?

275
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:56,105
Why don't we talk about this?

276
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:59,252
You sure you got the right man?

277
00:34:02,924 --> 00:34:05,290
Let's be reasonable.

278
00:34:08,062 --> 00:34:10,062
That's it.

279
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:49,837
I've known Woody Lopeman for 15 years.

280
00:34:49,937 --> 00:34:51,739
I'd give him the shirt off my back...

281
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,675
...but that don't mean
I'll let this town go down the drain.

282
00:34:54,775 --> 00:34:59,013
Hold on there, Harry. It ain't like he was
an out-and-out cripple. He's doing his job.

283
00:34:59,113 --> 00:35:02,416
The way I see it,
it's about time we got us a sheriff...

284
00:35:02,516 --> 00:35:05,486
...who can treat that jailhouse scum
like they was meant to be.

285
00:35:05,586 --> 00:35:07,955
What do you mean by that?
- Face up to it, Billy.

286
00:35:08,055 --> 00:35:10,358
He always did mollycoddle those bastards.

287
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:13,995
Christ, look at how he got it. Asking
a robber to hand his gun over to him.

288
00:35:14,095 --> 00:35:16,264
I don't care what the man's style is.

289
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:20,468
He kept this town clean and quiet.
He did his job good.

290
00:35:20,568 --> 00:35:25,239
That's exactly what I'm trying to tell you.
He did his job, but he can't do it no more.

291
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:28,137
Doc, now, you know I'm right.

292
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:34,004
Can a sheriff with a busted-up limb
do his job? For my money he's...

293
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:18,495
Thought the two of us
were gonna have a talk.

294
00:36:20,361 --> 00:36:22,361
I can't wait forever.

295
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:31,470
Things can get tougher, you know.
They can also get easier too.

296
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,640
It's up to you.

297
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:44,583
Go to hell!

298
00:36:51,892 --> 00:36:55,828
What was that?
- He said, 'Go to hell.'

299
00:37:03,504 --> 00:37:05,504
Get to work!

300
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:08,943
This could be the beginning
of something big.

301
00:37:09,043 --> 00:37:10,277
Such as what?

302
00:37:10,377 --> 00:37:14,627
Such as we could be
running this place pretty soon.

303
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:25,993
They just must not like your face.
They keep trying to change it.

304
00:37:26,093 --> 00:37:29,324
There's got to be a reason, Kid.

305
00:37:30,965 --> 00:37:33,667
Somebody's got to have
something in mind.

306
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:38,072
Yeah, but whatever it is,
they're playing it close to the vest.

307
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,697
I couldn't find out nothing.

308
00:37:41,108 --> 00:37:43,318
So, what are you gonna do?

309
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:48,425
Well, for one thing,
I've gotta get me some help.

310
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:18,638
Six to two he spits in your eye.

311
00:38:19,947 --> 00:38:21,947
You got a bet.

312
00:38:36,664 --> 00:38:41,254
Cabbage. My ma would have to whip me
before I'd eat it.

313
00:38:42,503 --> 00:38:49,218
Well, I guess it's a matter of taste.
I notice you happen to like it. I hate it.

314
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,505
Here. Take mine.

315
00:39:14,668 --> 00:39:16,963
I been watching you, Floyd.

316
00:39:18,372 --> 00:39:23,071
What's going on inside you?
Nobody knows but you. Smart.

317
00:39:23,844 --> 00:39:25,844
Real smart.

318
00:39:27,214 --> 00:39:30,444
I hear you shot it out with a sheriff.

319
00:39:31,418 --> 00:39:34,054
Cut him down to size, I hear, huh?

320
00:39:34,154 --> 00:39:38,319
That's a pretty feisty thing to do,
if you did it.

321
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:42,830
I bet there ain't a man in this yard
with your guts.

322
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:45,194
If you did it.

323
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:50,869
Well...

324
00:39:53,173 --> 00:39:55,173
I was--

325
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,010
I was drunk.

326
00:39:59,013 --> 00:40:02,574
And I still beat him to the draw, by God.

327
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,980
Ain't that something?

328
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,888
You must be the goddamnedest shot
in this territory.

329
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:10,691
Just one of the best.
- A sheriff?

330
00:40:10,791 --> 00:40:14,591
He must have been crazy
to tangle with you.

331
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,264
Well--
- Must have been a pretty big job.

332
00:40:17,364 --> 00:40:22,069
Hey, you don't shoot a sheriff
if he caught you spitting on the floor.

333
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:25,472
I've had my share of the big ones, all right.

334
00:40:25,572 --> 00:40:28,309
Big jobs, big outfits. The best, right?

335
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:30,711
That's right. They had to be.

336
00:40:30,811 --> 00:40:33,347
You're only as good as your worst man.

337
00:40:33,447 --> 00:40:37,251
Well, me, I never could afford to be choosy
who I had on my side.

338
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:41,155
I'd wind up with some of the worst
lamebrains you ever saw.

339
00:40:41,255 --> 00:40:45,760
You know, this time in Nogales, we--
- Hey, four-eyes.

340
00:40:48,262 --> 00:40:50,598
This time in Nogales,
there was this little bank--

341
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,698
Hey, four-eyes!

342
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,369
We're tired of coming to you.

343
00:40:55,469 --> 00:40:59,371
This time you come to us,
you yellow bastard.

344
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:28,429
All right, come on, break it up. Get back.

345
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:30,861
Come on, get back. Come on.

346
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,665
Nice work, son.
- Pitman.

347
00:42:40,574 --> 00:42:42,574
Pitman.

348
00:42:42,876 --> 00:42:45,256
The warden wants to see you.

349
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,279
What the hell is this?

350
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:59,291
In here, Pitman.

351
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,330
Warden.

352
00:43:18,979 --> 00:43:23,109
You have $500,000 hidden somewhere...

353
00:43:23,283 --> 00:43:26,120
...and it isn't doing you any good.

354
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,484
Son of a bitch.

355
00:43:28,989 --> 00:43:32,083
So that's what somebody had in mind.

356
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,962
Pitman, what sort of man
do you think I am?

357
00:43:35,062 --> 00:43:38,365
I don't know. Hadn't thought
about it much, to tell the truth.

358
00:43:38,465 --> 00:43:42,569
Not a happy one, I can tell you.
Does that surprise you?

359
00:43:42,669 --> 00:43:44,471
Nothing surprises me.

360
00:43:44,571 --> 00:43:49,910
The truth is, I find the atmosphere
of this place stifling, depressing, boring.

361
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:55,015
I'm sure you feel the same,
though perhaps not for the same reasons.

362
00:43:55,115 --> 00:43:56,417
Keep talking, sir.

363
00:43:56,517 --> 00:44:00,087
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
would do me very nicely.

364
00:44:00,187 --> 00:44:04,283
I could go abroad,
perhaps Mexico, live happily.

365
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:07,928
You help me to escape
and I'll do the same for you.

366
00:44:08,028 --> 00:44:10,697
Not a bad bargain.
- Not a good one, warden.

367
00:44:10,797 --> 00:44:12,533
That's half the money.

368
00:44:12,633 --> 00:44:14,301
You'd like to keep it all.

369
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,631
Am I being selfish?

370
00:44:18,505 --> 00:44:22,464
Your first few weeks here
have been difficult.

371
00:44:22,643 --> 00:44:25,546
I'm not much good to you dead, warden.
- Perhaps not.

372
00:44:25,646 --> 00:44:29,446
Still, life is full of surprises.

373
00:44:29,616 --> 00:44:32,119
So keep an open mind,
you never can tell.

374
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:35,959
No. No, I don't like having
my mind too open.

375
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:40,846
It makes it easier,
once you get around to changing it.

376
00:44:48,201 --> 00:44:52,606
I tell you, it was all I could do
to keep from pitching in.

377
00:44:52,706 --> 00:44:57,806
But the truth is, I once killed a man
with old Mary Ann here.

378
00:44:57,911 --> 00:45:00,607
Mary Ann was his mother's name.

379
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,908
Judas Priest.

380
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,717
Solitary?

381
00:45:42,689 --> 00:45:44,689
Hey, Tobaccy.

382
00:45:45,892 --> 00:45:48,362
Give him these for me, will you?
I owe him.

383
00:45:48,462 --> 00:45:54,242
Come on, Kid, you know he's not allowed.
- They're gonna be his last!

384
00:46:09,249 --> 00:46:12,819
Hey, Kid. What are you gonna do
with that when it gets ripe?

385
00:46:12,919 --> 00:46:16,089
Smoke it, you silly son of a bitch.
What else?

386
00:46:16,189 --> 00:46:18,189
Smoke it?

387
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:45,352
Cyrus, I just can't figure it.

388
00:46:45,452 --> 00:46:47,988
What's Skinner got against the boy?

389
00:46:48,088 --> 00:46:51,524
Oh, for God's sakes, Dudley.

390
00:47:14,047 --> 00:47:16,345
Could've had it so easy.

391
00:47:28,028 --> 00:47:30,068
Who threw that?
- He did.

392
00:48:32,859 --> 00:48:34,528
Come on, you guys.

393
00:48:34,628 --> 00:48:36,830
Come on, you dumb bastards, move!

394
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:38,298
Stop it!

395
00:48:38,398 --> 00:48:42,391
Stop it! Stop it, you hear? Stop it!

396
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:50,527
Stop them! Get in there and stop them,
you Chink son of a bitch!

397
00:48:50,544 --> 00:48:56,069
What are you doing? Stop it.
Let go of me. Let go of me, you Chi--

398
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:46,867
Sir.

399
00:49:46,967 --> 00:49:51,217
Tell your commanding officer
the new warden's here.

400
00:50:24,804 --> 00:50:28,544
This place is bigger than I thought it'd be.

401
00:50:29,709 --> 00:50:32,542
Mr. Lopeman.
- Colonel Wolff.

402
00:50:32,746 --> 00:50:34,781
Well, I'm not sorry to see you.

403
00:50:34,881 --> 00:50:36,716
Things seem quiet enough now.

404
00:50:36,816 --> 00:50:40,896
The last man I heard say that
was General Custer.

405
00:50:41,021 --> 00:50:42,489
What's that gonna be?

406
00:50:42,589 --> 00:50:46,092
Well, that was supposed to be
new quarters for the warden.

407
00:50:46,192 --> 00:50:47,794
What was wrong with the old ones?

408
00:50:47,894 --> 00:50:50,764
The last warden just wanted
something bigger.

409
00:50:50,864 --> 00:50:53,458
And I guess he got it.

410
00:50:54,334 --> 00:50:56,036
Look here.

411
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,805
They told me something
and I just couldn't believe it.

412
00:50:58,905 --> 00:51:00,874
Did you ask for this job?

413
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,475
That's right.

414
00:51:02,575 --> 00:51:06,613
But nobody asks to be warden
of this prison, Mr. Lopeman.

415
00:51:06,713 --> 00:51:10,878
Even Daniel didn't wanna walk
into the lions' den.

416
00:51:11,584 --> 00:51:14,134
These aren't animals, colonel.

417
00:51:15,689 --> 00:51:17,782
You could've fooled me.

418
00:51:57,063 --> 00:51:59,063
I'm your new warden.

419
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,326
My name's Lopeman.

420
00:52:02,435 --> 00:52:05,138
You've all raised a lot of hell last week.

421
00:52:05,238 --> 00:52:09,175
Here's what it got you:
Six dead, and you're still here.

422
00:52:09,275 --> 00:52:12,779
From now on, if something's bothering you,
come tell me about it.

423
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:16,144
I mean that. Tell me first.

424
00:52:16,783 --> 00:52:19,775
That's all. Eat your breakfast now.

425
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:38,337
What's this?
- It's solitary, sir.

426
00:53:04,831 --> 00:53:07,734
How long has he been here?
- Ten days, sir.

427
00:53:07,834 --> 00:53:09,569
Get him to the doctor.

428
00:53:09,669 --> 00:53:11,669
There ain't none.

429
00:53:16,209 --> 00:53:19,906
This one?
- It's the longest. Three weeks.

430
00:53:26,753 --> 00:53:29,558
Well, you must be the new warden.

431
00:53:29,689 --> 00:53:31,850
What the hell is this?

432
00:53:32,025 --> 00:53:34,493
Come in. Come in.

433
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:45,067
Cigar, warden?
Compliments of the old warden.

434
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:48,964
Don't smoke. Drink, maybe?

435
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:55,279
Don't drink.

436
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:58,983
Well...

437
00:53:59,285 --> 00:54:02,322
...I guess you wanna hear the truth.
- It would help.

438
00:54:02,422 --> 00:54:05,358
Well, maybe you ain't heard,
but I got 500,000--

439
00:54:05,458 --> 00:54:07,994
Thousand, that is.
- -dollars in U.S. legal currency...

440
00:54:08,094 --> 00:54:11,264
...hid in a hole somewhere in this territory.

441
00:54:11,364 --> 00:54:14,265
Nobody knows where but me.

442
00:54:16,469 --> 00:54:20,273
Now, the man who used to have your job
got to brooding on it after a time...

443
00:54:20,373 --> 00:54:22,923
...as I expect you will and...

444
00:54:23,276 --> 00:54:28,805
Well, I'll save you the trouble
and tell you what we was gonna do.

445
00:54:29,115 --> 00:54:32,585
After four weeks of solitary,
it's enough to kill any man.

446
00:54:32,685 --> 00:54:34,087
I was supposed to break.

447
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:37,590
You know, start yelling like,
'All right, all right, get me out of here.

448
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:39,426
I'll tell you where I hid the money.

449
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:45,665
But the only person I'll tell it to
is the governor himself, face to face.'

450
00:54:45,765 --> 00:54:51,035
Sounds like something out of
one of them dime novels, don't it?

451
00:55:02,248 --> 00:55:04,050
Well, anyway, here's the ticket.

452
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:06,352
Warden LeGoff
was gonna take me out of here...

453
00:55:06,452 --> 00:55:08,488
...under his guard, to see the governor.

454
00:55:08,588 --> 00:55:11,091
Well, me being such
an important desperado, see?

455
00:55:11,191 --> 00:55:13,426
Only thing, on the way to the capital...

456
00:55:13,526 --> 00:55:17,397
...we was gonna drop by
and visit with my money.

457
00:55:17,497 --> 00:55:19,897
Split it down the middle...

458
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:22,626
...hightail it to Mexico.

459
00:55:23,102 --> 00:55:25,102
Live like kings.

460
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:29,907
But...

461
00:55:30,109 --> 00:55:36,059
...as it turned out, Warden LeGoff
has gone on to a far greater reward.

462
00:55:38,718 --> 00:55:44,158
Which is just about the luckiest thing
that ever happened to you.

463
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,308
Back to the rock pile, right?

464
00:56:02,408 --> 00:56:04,408
You guessed it.

465
00:56:08,481 --> 00:56:10,481
Warden.

466
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:14,766
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

467
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,876
Thank you for everything, colonel.

468
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:39,913
I'll be seeing you again.
- I hope so.

469
00:56:40,013 --> 00:56:45,963
The way it works around this prison,
I generally see wardens only once.

470
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,968
Somebody in this pokey
must have an idea how to bust out.

471
00:57:02,068 --> 00:57:04,263
Forget it, son.

472
00:57:04,871 --> 00:57:09,672
For $500,000,
there's got to be a first time.

473
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,180
Five hundred thousand?

474
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:18,818
And whoever comes up
with a way, you split with him.

475
00:57:18,918 --> 00:57:20,286
You're quick, Cyrus.

476
00:57:20,386 --> 00:57:22,322
Can you keep your mouth shut?
- He can't.

477
00:57:22,422 --> 00:57:25,058
I got it! I got it, I tell you.
- Well, let it out.

478
00:57:25,158 --> 00:57:28,059
Easy. A tunnel out of here.

479
00:57:28,227 --> 00:57:32,732
Ten feet down, 50 feet out, and we're free
and clear on the other side of the wall.

480
00:57:32,832 --> 00:57:34,300
Now, you hold it right there.

481
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,936
You'll do your three years
and we'll walk out of here.

482
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,639
You know my heart can't take
three years in this place!

483
00:57:39,739 --> 00:57:41,975
It ain't your heart that's weak,
it's your head!

484
00:57:42,075 --> 00:57:43,943
Turn it off, turn it off.

485
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:47,380
It'd take you three years to dig the tunnel.
Then where would you be?

486
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,782
On the other side of the wall?

487
00:57:49,882 --> 00:57:53,877
I wanna get a lot further than that.
Right, Coy?

488
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:02,426
Anyway, start smelling around,
and don't forget one thing.

489
00:58:02,662 --> 00:58:06,742
I'm putting my trust in all of you
to keep quiet.

490
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:12,865
Like asking a pack of coyotes
to keep quiet about a dead horse.

491
00:58:28,821 --> 00:58:32,825
We've already got more stone
than we can use for the new building.

492
00:58:32,925 --> 00:58:38,765
Starting now, there'll be no work
in this quarry except for punishment.

493
00:58:38,865 --> 00:58:44,305
You'll all return to the yard,
where you'll be assigned new jobs.

494
00:58:45,138 --> 00:58:48,878
That man there will remain on the rock pile.

495
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:56,115
Warden, I figure by now, every man
in this prison knows about my 500,000.

496
00:58:56,215 --> 00:58:58,951
Yep. Yeah,
they'll be laying awake nights.

497
00:58:59,051 --> 00:59:01,688
Each one trying to bust me out of here
to get his share.

498
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,916
Well, you had your chance.

499
00:59:06,225 --> 00:59:10,127
Pitman, come over here.

500
00:59:22,442 --> 00:59:26,012
Between this place and the nearest town...

501
00:59:26,446 --> 00:59:29,761
...there's 50 miles of crap and cactus.

502
00:59:32,118 --> 00:59:37,133
One man on the loose out there...
You're too smart for that.

503
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:33,709
Paris Pitman's in your cell.
- So?

504
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,716
He's got a notion of escaping.
- Does he?

505
01:00:36,816 --> 01:00:39,252
You know he does, Moon. We all do.
- Do we?

506
01:00:39,352 --> 01:00:41,479
Goddamn it, sit down.

507
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:45,525
I'm not saying you know
what he's gonna do.

508
01:00:45,625 --> 01:00:48,694
Probably doesn't know that himself yet.

509
01:00:48,794 --> 01:00:52,865
When he makes up his mind,
you'll know about it a lot sooner than I will.

510
01:00:52,965 --> 01:00:54,467
I will?

511
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:57,370
You'll get paid.
Hell, Moon, you've done it before.

512
01:00:57,470 --> 01:01:00,039
You sold out gangs
to every sheriff in the territory.

513
01:01:00,139 --> 01:01:03,576
That's how you made your living.
You've done it for me. Remember Simmons?

514
01:01:03,676 --> 01:01:05,311
That was different.

515
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:08,281
I never could stand Simmons.
He was a mean son of a bitch.

516
01:01:08,381 --> 01:01:10,016
And all the others before him?

517
01:01:10,116 --> 01:01:13,219
I didn't care about them neither.
- But you do care about Pitman.

518
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:15,869
Do you think he's your friend?

519
01:01:16,489 --> 01:01:18,489
Yeah.

520
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,968
I guess that's what he is.

521
01:01:21,561 --> 01:01:23,561
A friend.

522
01:01:25,364 --> 01:01:27,798
So you finally found one.

523
01:01:34,974 --> 01:01:37,779
That's all. Go back to your cell.

524
01:01:53,659 --> 01:01:56,127
Step it up, boys. Step it up.

525
01:02:20,419 --> 01:02:26,225
Paris, whatever that is that you're drawing,
you can see it clear across the yard.

526
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:29,395
Hey, you three down there!
What's all that talk about?

527
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:34,233
Oh, just trying to get this whitewash
the right shade, captain.

528
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:38,923
Them buzzards on that wall
don't miss a trick, do they?

529
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:06,330
Pick it up.

530
01:03:07,166 --> 01:03:09,896
Pick it up, you stupid Chink!

531
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:12,369
Pick it up!

532
01:03:22,114 --> 01:03:23,649
What's going on?

533
01:03:23,749 --> 01:03:26,274
Goddamn Chiney won't move.

534
01:03:32,224 --> 01:03:34,774
What's troubling you, Ah-Ping?

535
01:03:38,497 --> 01:03:40,877
Come on down, talk about it.

536
01:03:50,109 --> 01:03:52,109
Ah-Ping, hold it!

537
01:03:53,245 --> 01:03:56,043
Warden, don't you move a muscle.

538
01:03:59,251 --> 01:04:02,584
Ah-Ping, put it down.

539
01:04:03,122 --> 01:04:05,122
Put it down.

540
01:04:09,462 --> 01:04:11,521
Put it down, Ah-Ping.

541
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,601
Now, come on down.

542
01:04:21,207 --> 01:04:23,207
Come on.

543
01:04:25,845 --> 01:04:27,845
Come on down.

544
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:42,140
Why don't you go back to the cell
and take it easy?

545
01:04:50,836 --> 01:04:53,896
See you in my quarters after supper.

546
01:04:53,906 --> 01:04:55,906
Yes, sir.

547
01:05:04,917 --> 01:05:08,444
Pitman, this afternoon,
why'd you do that?

548
01:05:09,321 --> 01:05:11,424
Just wanted to see if I could.

549
01:05:11,524 --> 01:05:14,193
I ask you in here to say thanks,
and you smart-mouth me.

550
01:05:14,293 --> 01:05:16,829
Oh, is that why you asked me here?

551
01:05:16,929 --> 01:05:18,698
I'm gonna tell you something.

552
01:05:18,798 --> 01:05:22,401
It doesn't make a damn bit of sense to me,
but those men look up to you.

553
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:24,670
What does that mean to you?

554
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:27,840
Oh, maybe an extra cup of coffee,
a few cigarettes.

555
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:32,111
Don't you give a damn what you mean
to them? What you can do for them?

556
01:05:32,211 --> 01:05:34,211
So long, warden.

557
01:05:34,213 --> 01:05:36,678
I'll see you around the yard.

558
01:05:37,083 --> 01:05:43,373
Why do you work at it so hard,
proving to yourself you're a son of a bitch?

559
01:05:43,489 --> 01:05:46,981
Because I am. It's my profession.

560
01:05:47,159 --> 01:05:48,694
And I'm at the top.

561
01:05:48,794 --> 01:05:51,991
Top of a prison yard.
- Not for long.

562
01:05:53,399 --> 01:05:57,309
It's not so easy being a leader of men, is it?

563
01:06:01,107 --> 01:06:02,875
Pitman.

564
01:06:02,975 --> 01:06:06,290
Those men out there are filthy as hogs.

565
01:06:06,378 --> 01:06:10,033
Can't you at least get them to take a bath?

566
01:06:35,941 --> 01:06:38,808
Missouri Kid, you're next.
- No!

567
01:06:38,978 --> 01:06:42,181
There's a limit, damn it!
A man's got his pride!

568
01:06:42,281 --> 01:06:45,317
Come on, Kid, everybody's
gotta take a bath once in his life.

569
01:06:45,417 --> 01:06:48,421
I ain't gonna do it!
I ain't gonna get in there!

570
01:06:48,521 --> 01:06:50,656
Soap and water ain't gonna kill you.

571
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:55,686
It's the idea of the thing! It's humiliating!
- Go on. Get.

572
01:06:58,097 --> 01:06:59,832
I'll give you 10 smokes.

573
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:04,892
I'll give you 15 smokes.
Paris. Twenty. Twenty specials.

574
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:07,070
Now, don't-- Stop that!

575
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:12,035
Twenty-five. Special!

576
01:07:22,488 --> 01:07:27,551
Listen. I've had this thing on for 35 years...

577
01:07:27,726 --> 01:07:30,029
...and you're not gonna
get me out of it now!

578
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:32,231
Oh, for God's sakes,
leave them on, Paris!

579
01:07:32,331 --> 01:07:34,700
It's the only way they're gonna get washed!

580
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,350
Kid, we all gotta go sometime.

581
01:07:58,891 --> 01:08:01,052
Oh, my God.

582
01:08:01,527 --> 01:08:04,121
This is worse than I thought.

583
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:31,516
Hey, cut that out, Kid.

584
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:33,851
No peeing in the water.
