1
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:54,329
Sorry, friend. We ain't open yet.

2
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:10,942
You can bring that over to the table.

3
00:02:11,147 --> 00:02:13,081
You, bring me a bottle.

4
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:16,782
Tell him.

5
00:02:16,953 --> 00:02:18,420
You tell him.

6
00:02:18,588 --> 00:02:20,249
I'm eating.

7
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,290
Sorry, friend.

8
00:02:24,527 --> 00:02:26,222
No sense in you hanging around.

9
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,559
Like I told you before,
we ain't open this early.

10
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,963
Are you deaf?

11
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,632
Who? Me?

12
00:02:35,805 --> 00:02:36,965
Yeah, you.

13
00:02:37,807 --> 00:02:39,035
Huh.

14
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:43,077
Well, I guess you didn't hear me. I said
I wanted something to eat and a bottle.

15
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,409
And I want it on this table.
If it was here now, it would be late.

16
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:49,879
Can't you see I'm eating?

17
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,422
Now you can bring me a bottle.

18
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:12,805
Open it.

19
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:14,443
What?

20
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:17,074
Are you sure you ain't deaf?

21
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,543
Who knows Steve Sinclair?

22
00:03:56,753 --> 00:03:58,277
Who?

23
00:03:58,621 --> 00:04:00,748
Steve Sinclair.

24
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,055
We both know him.
Everybody knows Steve.

25
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:05,693
He owns the Double S Ranch.
Him and his brother.

26
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:07,056
Big ranch owner, huh?

27
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,055
Pretty big.

28
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:11,893
He and Tony own
almost a third of the valley.

29
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:14,559
Mr. Deneen owns all the rest.

30
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,075
You finished with my breakfast?

31
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,406
Sinclair ever come around here?

32
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:27,014
Sometimes.

33
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,083
Think he might come in here today?

34
00:04:29,285 --> 00:04:31,583
Look, mister, I'm no mind reader.

35
00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:38,550
I ain't asking you
to read minds, pig face.

36
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:41,891
I'm asking you if you expect
Steve Sinclair to come in here today.

37
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:44,259
They sent the herd out
a couple of weeks ago.

38
00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:46,425
Could be coming back for supplies.

39
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,009
If you're looking for trouble,
I hope you take it outside.

40
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,512
Mr. Deneen don't like gun play
around here.

41
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:02,048
We're obliged to him.

42
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:04,515
We like to see that he gets
what he wants.

43
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,712
He sure don't appreciate gun play.

44
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:28,269
Mr. Deneen don't appreciate gun play,
and I don't appreciate watered liquor.

45
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:32,378
If either of you see Steve Sinclair,
don't tell him he's got a caller.

46
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:34,379
I want it to be a surprise.

47
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,381
He's an old friend of mine.

48
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,254
Do you hear that?

49
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,885
- Yahoo!
- Hey, Steve.

50
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:33,972
You better have
about $ 7800 on you...

51
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,304
...or you can just ride back
the way you came.

52
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,176
I didn't lose a steer the whole way and
I got $5 more a head than we figured.

53
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,611
- You're lucky.
- I'm good, that's what I am.

54
00:06:42,785 --> 00:06:44,309
Good.

55
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:50,154
- Whoo.
- Ha-ha-ha.

56
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,954
- Good to have you back, Tony.
- Yeah, sure.

57
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,791
Oh, I forgot to tell you, Steve.

58
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:03,996
I'm shy a few dollars.
I paid $286 for that team and wagon.

59
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,471
How much did you pay
for what's on it?

60
00:07:10,213 --> 00:07:12,511
A little surprise, Steve.
This is Joan Blake.

61
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,206
Glad to know you, Miss Blake.

62
00:07:14,383 --> 00:07:17,546
This is my brother, Joanie.
This is Steve.

63
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,813
Tony's told me all about you, Steve.

64
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,855
She's from Jeweltown, Steve.

65
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:24,421
Aww.

66
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:26,391
Come on.

67
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:32,225
Manuelo.

68
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:36,667
Manuelo.

69
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,864
- Senor Tony, how are you? Ha-ha-ha.
- Manuelo.

70
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,599
- Hey.
- Nice to see you home.

71
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:42,573
Hey, Joan. Joan.

72
00:07:42,745 --> 00:07:45,612
This is Miss Blake, Manuelo.
She's gonna stay here with us.

73
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:48,449
Joanie, go with him. Go ahead.

74
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:50,415
You come with me, senorita.

75
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:52,779
<i>Da-da-da-da</i>

76
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:55,549
Manuelo, put her in my room.
I'll bunk with Steve.

77
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,884
Do you like her?
I know you're gonna like her.

78
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,256
Ain't she beautiful?

79
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,422
Yeah. Where did you meet her?
How'd you come to bring her here?

80
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,036
You're looking at a man with a rope
in his hand, ready to tie the knot.

81
00:08:08,204 --> 00:08:09,296
I'm gonna get married.

82
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,439
We're gonna get married.
Joan and me.

83
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:13,700
Ain't it the darnedest thing
you ever heard?

84
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:15,537
Yeah, it's great. Congratulations.

85
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:18,077
You bet it is. It is great.

86
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,216
Come on inside.
I got something else I wanna show you.

87
00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:23,244
Tony.

88
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,745
Hamp.

89
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,051
- I'd like to wash up.
- I'll bet you would.

90
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:32,717
I wanna hear what's been going on
the past few weeks.

91
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,126
- Thought you'd keep an eye on him.
- Can't keep an eye on that kid.

92
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,757
Looking after your brother is like
poking hot butter in a wildcat's ear.

93
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,995
It just can't be done.

94
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:43,502
Where did he meet the girl?

95
00:08:43,673 --> 00:08:46,972
I don't know. Only thing I know
is the morning we started back...

96
00:08:47,143 --> 00:08:50,408
...I see this girl outside the dancehall
in a brand-new buckboard.

97
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:53,474
We got instructions from Tony
to call her Miss Blake...

98
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:55,674
...and he was bringing her back
to marry.

99
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:57,341
What did you do?

100
00:08:57,687 --> 00:08:59,917
I shut my pipe and mounted up.

101
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:03,684
That kid brother of yours can get
mighty hard-nosed if you crowd him.

102
00:09:03,859 --> 00:09:06,794
He must have been dead drunk
or sun-struck.

103
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,328
He wasn't either of them.

104
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:10,657
He just found something he liked.

105
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,495
- He's of age, Steve.
- That's not the problem.

106
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:15,364
Could be she might settle him.

107
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:17,869
Women have a way
of doing that with a kid.

108
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:21,134
Not that woman. Not this kid.

109
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,609
Tony?

110
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:29,648
Hey, Steve.

111
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,684
This here's a present from me to you.

112
00:09:31,854 --> 00:09:33,515
That's me.

113
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:39,018
Looks like you. How'd they get you
to hold still long enough to make that?

114
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:40,890
They sneaked up on me, I guess.

115
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:43,395
Hey, I got something else
to show you.

116
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:45,692
It's something I bought for myself.

117
00:09:54,043 --> 00:09:55,135
Where did you get it?

118
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:58,109
I bought it.
I had a gunsmith fix it up for me.

119
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:00,876
I don't like tricked-up guns, Tony.

120
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,985
Got that trigger honed down so fine,
you could sneeze it off.

121
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:05,245
Old Sourdough Sinclair.

122
00:10:05,421 --> 00:10:08,754
With a little practice, I could draw
that gun in one second even.

123
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,925
Hey, everything all right, Joanie?

124
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:15,492
You all right?

125
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,063
You look great.

126
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:22,237
Steve, ain't she beautiful?

127
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:25,431
Ain't this the most beautiful thing
you saw around this place?

128
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:27,506
You'll embarrass
the poor girl to death.

129
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,543
Don't pay any attention to Steve.
He's a poker player.

130
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,443
You never know what he's thinking.
You know what I mean?

131
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:37,075
Come on outside.
I'll show you my new gun.

132
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:40,711
If I were you, I'd live with that a while
before I took it in anyplace.

133
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,051
I can't live with it unless I use it.

134
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,386
Joan, I'll show you
the fastest gun in the West.

135
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,392
Come on, Steve.

136
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,165
Tony.

137
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,034
- Now, watch the plowshare.
- I'd like to talk to you...

138
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,211
I'd like to talk to you about that girl.

139
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:05,472
Oh, I'd love to talk about her,
but not now.

140
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:10,717
Will you put that gun away?

141
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,481
Hey, hey, hey.

142
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,759
Why the crouch? You afraid
that thing's gonna draw?

143
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,952
- Let's keep it in the family.
- I asked you.

144
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:22,996
- You afraid it's gonna draw against you?
- Maybe someday.

145
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:25,326
What? You got something
against practicing?

146
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:26,593
Don't needle me, Tony.

147
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,101
You know how I feel.
I told you a hundred times.

148
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,967
I got something against the breed
that over practices.

149
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:36,737
How do I get that to register? Crawl in
your head with an iron and burn it there?

150
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:41,311
Hey, Steve. You don't understand.

151
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:43,610
See, I'm doing this for you.

152
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,651
I gotta take care of you.

153
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:49,518
You know, you're a reformed character,
an ex-gunfighter...

154
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:51,989
...and you don't use
that iron of yours anymore.

155
00:11:52,161 --> 00:11:54,493
Now, supposing
somebody comes looking for you...

156
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:58,030
...maybe tomorrow,
maybe the next day, maybe never.

157
00:11:58,234 --> 00:12:00,862
You know, I gotta be good.

158
00:12:01,103 --> 00:12:03,799
I gotta be really good.
We got this valley to look after.

159
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,964
Steve, I'm your brother.

160
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:11,637
Now, maybe you don't like it,
but I'm not a kid anymore.

161
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:15,682
You're not a kid anymore either.
I mean, you're getting on, you know?

162
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:17,375
And...

163
00:12:17,953 --> 00:12:22,822
Well, it's my right to protect you,
and I intend to.

164
00:12:25,628 --> 00:12:27,391
I understand, Tony.

165
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:29,554
Maybe better than you think.

166
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:37,695
Go on inside. Go ahead.

167
00:12:37,873 --> 00:12:39,670
Go on.

168
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:50,074
- You want some coffee?
- No, thank you.

169
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:52,982
When the lady's in the house,
there should be something of beauty.

170
00:12:57,426 --> 00:12:58,654
Manuelo.

171
00:13:00,062 --> 00:13:03,327
Thank you for the flower. It's lovely.

172
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,230
Well, do I pass muster?

173
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:14,542
You're not being judged, Miss Blake.

174
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:19,906
I'm the kind of a girl that likes to know
whether or not to unpack her bags.

175
00:13:20,082 --> 00:13:21,515
Call it a family trait.

176
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:24,044
It's not a bad trait.

177
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,087
Okay, sit down.
I'll lay this right on the line for you.

178
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:30,451
Tony's a kid.

179
00:13:30,626 --> 00:13:35,029
He's not ready for a wife, and this ranch
isn't ready for a woman. Not yet.

180
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,126
You have plenty of room.

181
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,062
Tony says you're running
a big valley here.

182
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:42,028
Tony's got a healthy imagination.

183
00:13:42,204 --> 00:13:44,434
We don't run this valley.
We own a third of it.

184
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:46,871
We'll be 20 years paying for that.

185
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:50,375
There's an old man here named Deneen.
He opened it up a long time ago.

186
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:52,480
I was his trail boss for three years.

187
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:56,140
Then, thanks to him, I had
a piece of land and a start of cattle.

188
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:01,250
And you're not about to give
any of it away, are you?

189
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,756
Let's just say I'm particular
about who I share it with.

190
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,428
You don't think
Tony's particular enough.

191
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,499
Outside of a first and last name,
I don't know who you are.

192
00:14:12,668 --> 00:14:14,898
Also, nobody's told me
what you want.

193
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,833
I came here to marry Tony...

194
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:19,804
...because I want a home.
- Mm-hm.

195
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:23,103
Maybe you're not particular enough.
Maybe that's what bothers me.

196
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,985
He takes to a gun, doesn't he?

197
00:14:33,155 --> 00:14:35,419
You wouldn't be expected
to know that.

198
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:37,582
He walks into your dancehall
with money...

199
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,489
...and he's fair game.

200
00:14:39,662 --> 00:14:44,622
Couple of songs and a half a bottle later,
he's bought you a rig, promised a valley.

201
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,529
I'm no slut, Mr. Sinclair.

202
00:14:46,702 --> 00:14:49,603
He didn't buy me
like he bought that gun.

203
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:52,965
All right, I've got an open mind.
Where are you from?

204
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,803
A lot of places.

205
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:57,345
I spent the first 12 years of my life...

206
00:14:57,513 --> 00:15:00,175
...going from one dirty
little frontier town to another.

207
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:02,681
My father was a hide hunter.

208
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:05,285
After so many years
and so many bottles...

209
00:15:05,454 --> 00:15:08,685
...he couldn't tell the difference
between a buffalo and a burro.

210
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,652
I'm not trying
to give you this with a piano.

211
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,852
You asked me, and I'm telling you.

212
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,690
All right, then. Tell me
how you feel about my kid brother.

213
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:19,857
Give it to me straight and honest.

214
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:25,974
A couple of days ago,
this kid came in, he called me "miss."

215
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:29,570
He asked me to sing this song
that he likes so much.

216
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,707
Well, I'll tell you something. You...

217
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:34,542
It was like a breath of fresh air.

218
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:38,249
You know saloon singers,
don't you, Mr. Sinclair?

219
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:40,922
You know they're not called "miss."

220
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:45,686
Later, he bought me supper,
and we talked.

221
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:53,367
Oh, we talked for a lot of hours
about me and him.

222
00:15:53,836 --> 00:15:56,771
Then he told me about you
and this valley here.

223
00:15:56,972 --> 00:15:59,202
And he made it sound like...

224
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:02,837
Like I had to come here.

225
00:16:04,913 --> 00:16:07,711
One more chorus
in that dirty little room, Mr. Sinclair...

226
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:12,877
...and I'd have spit in somebody's eye,
or got sick, or...

227
00:16:14,023 --> 00:16:16,082
Or just died.

228
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:23,428
Straight and honest,
just like you ordered?

229
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:30,933
You know, Tony said
you were his big brother.

230
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,534
Anyone ever tell you
you sound like his father?

231
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:41,611
I've been his father since
he was 4 years old, and his mother.

232
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,251
Look, there's a lot about this kid
even I don't understand.

233
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,753
So how do you expect to know him?

234
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,754
This boy has problems.

235
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,415
I take it so does his brother.

236
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,653
- We're talking about Tony.
- Well, I'm talking about you now.

237
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,890
I know Tony's problem,
or at least part of it.

238
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:00,797
But I was watching you out there too.

239
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,172
Don't tear out your palms,
Mr. Sinclair.

240
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,241
I've seen reformed gunmen before.

241
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:47,177
So I said, "Steve, that's not all
I brought back."

242
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,483
You should have seen his face.

243
00:17:51,453 --> 00:17:53,819
Hey, Fred.
Fred, you're sitting right next to her.

244
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:57,186
Now, ain't she the most
beautiful girl you ever saw, huh?

245
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,123
Oh, you know
I don't see many girls up here.

246
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:02,955
Hey, Hamp. Hey, Hamp.

247
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:07,159
What's your opinion?
I mean, you're older than any of us.

248
00:18:07,903 --> 00:18:10,064
She sure is pretty.

249
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:13,003
Attaboy, Hamp.
I'd knew you'd be with me.

250
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,369
Isn't that right?

251
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:20,071
Now, here's a man that goes into
Jeweltown every year, twice a year...

252
00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:22,012
...and he's never
brought back a woman yet.

253
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,378
Where are you going?

254
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:28,352
I gotta stick new shoes
on my horse.

255
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,549
We gotta go to town
to put that money away.

256
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:32,887
- I'll give you a hand.
- Wait a minute.

257
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:35,360
Aren't you forgetting something?

258
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:38,395
Oh, oh. Ahem.

259
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:44,403
The boys wanted me to tell you
how happy we are to have you here.

260
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,335
And?

261
00:18:46,675 --> 00:18:50,509
Oh. And if there's anything we can do
to help, just let us know.

262
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:57,543
We'll be glad to help you.

263
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:06,460
- What are you doing?
- I have to clean the table, Senor Tony.

264
00:19:06,662 --> 00:19:08,721
Well, you're not gonna
clean the table now.

265
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,797
Not now? Why?

266
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,040
Hey.

267
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,378
Did you like his speech?

268
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:30,383
I think you wrote it very well.

269
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,781
Look, relax.

270
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:39,587
You're gonna like it here,
and Steve's gonna like you.

271
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,924
You know, it's kind of sudden.
He's gotta chew on it for a while.

272
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,156
So it seems.

273
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,733
I got no worries.
It's gonna work out just fine.

274
00:19:47,803 --> 00:19:49,464
You know, it's funny with him.

275
00:19:49,638 --> 00:19:52,630
He still treats me like a kid,
and that riles, it really does.

276
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:54,571
But I'll tell you something, Joanie.

277
00:19:54,743 --> 00:19:57,803
He's the only one I'll take it from
because he's number one.

278
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,947
I gathered.

279
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,015
You don't like him, do you?

280
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,144
That's because you don't know him.

281
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:09,751
I've lived with him all my life.

282
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:12,792
This is a man that rode
with Quantrill's Raiders.

283
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,122
This is a man that I saw
outdraw five men...

284
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,026
...before I was 12 years old.

285
00:20:17,232 --> 00:20:19,132
This is a man...

286
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,496
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

287
00:20:22,004 --> 00:20:25,337
You just have kind of a special look
when you talk about your brother.

288
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:29,537
What's the matter?
I do something wrong?

289
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,605
Hmm?

290
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,279
Who gave you that smile?

291
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,179
What smile?

292
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:40,551
The one I'm looking at. I like it.

293
00:20:41,857 --> 00:20:43,688
- You wear it well.
- Heh.

294
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:47,351
I always figured it was an ordinary smile.
Well, it came with the face.

295
00:20:49,464 --> 00:20:51,125
Hey...

296
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:52,558
Hey what?

297
00:20:53,468 --> 00:20:55,026
Hey, sing to me.

298
00:20:55,771 --> 00:20:57,329
Just like that?

299
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,532
Just like that, for old times' sake.

300
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:02,700
For old times' sake,
like two days ago?

301
00:21:04,046 --> 00:21:07,538
Come on, sing for me
and I'll smile for you.

302
00:21:09,284 --> 00:21:13,277
<i>Sometimes I'd like</i>

303
00:21:13,822 --> 00:21:17,588
<i>To saddle the wind</i>

304
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:24,656
<i>And ride to where you are</i>

305
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:29,701
<i>We may meet in a valley</i>

306
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:33,602
<i>Or on a green hill</i>

307
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:38,574
<i>Will I be yours?</i>

308
00:21:38,747 --> 00:21:42,239
<i>You know I will</i>

309
00:21:43,685 --> 00:21:46,950
<i>Dearest one</i>

310
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:51,218
<i>My place in the sun</i>

311
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,760
<i>Is by your side</i>

312
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:58,231
<i>I know</i>

313
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:03,333
<i>So if I could</i>

314
00:22:03,705 --> 00:22:07,869
<i>I'd saddle the wind</i>

315
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:12,609
<i>Some starry night</i>

316
00:22:12,848 --> 00:22:18,480
<i>I'll saddle the wind</i>

317
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:25,758
<i>And straight to your arms</i>

318
00:22:26,461 --> 00:22:31,228
<i>I'll go</i>

319
00:22:56,324 --> 00:22:58,155
What's the matter with you?

320
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:04,326
You kiss me like you paid
for the privilege.

321
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,456
I don't like that kind of kiss.

322
00:23:07,702 --> 00:23:09,670
I don't know how to figure you.

323
00:23:09,838 --> 00:23:13,296
You sing to me like you invited me in,
and then you shut the door on me.

324
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,842
I mean, I'd like to understand you.
I'd like to know what you want.

325
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:19,906
Gently, Tony.

326
00:23:20,449 --> 00:23:24,510
Anything you do for me, do it gently.

327
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,785
Understand?

328
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,213
All right.

329
00:23:28,423 --> 00:23:31,290
All I need is time,
and I'll do everything the way you want.

330
00:24:01,223 --> 00:24:03,191
Put this money away, Tony.
See you later.

331
00:24:03,391 --> 00:24:06,554
All right, all right. Steve, I'm broke.

332
00:24:08,897 --> 00:24:09,921
Here.

333
00:24:19,908 --> 00:24:21,466
Hamp?

334
00:24:54,776 --> 00:24:55,800
- Bam!
- Bam!

335
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:58,002
You got me. Ha-ha-ha-ha.

336
00:24:58,213 --> 00:24:59,237
Tony.

337
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,215
- Are you getting fat?
- Are you getting fat?

338
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,649
Oh, this is my boy.

339
00:25:08,523 --> 00:25:10,047
Hamp, well, welcome back.

340
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:11,556
Glad to see you, boy, glad.

341
00:25:11,726 --> 00:25:13,421
They tie you to that saloon, son?

342
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,823
Ain't you got a home?

343
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,463
Not since Steve run me off.

344
00:25:16,631 --> 00:25:18,895
- Is he mean as ever?
- Not to everybody.

345
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:20,967
Just to no-good drifters like you.

346
00:25:21,536 --> 00:25:23,766
This must be that girl
I've been hearing about.

347
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,930
That's right. Take your hat off.

348
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,736
Joan Blake, this is Dallas Hanson.
He used to work for us.

349
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:30,935
How do you do?

350
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:34,240
Formerly of the 4th Alabams.
Confederate States of America.

351
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:37,476
- We held our ground at Shi...
- We held our ground at Shiloh. Heh.

352
00:25:37,652 --> 00:25:41,110
If there was four more like you, we'd
have lost the first battle of Bull Run.

353
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,154
Hoo-hoo-hoo. Hoo.

354
00:25:43,358 --> 00:25:45,417
I do believe
this calls for a celebration.

355
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:49,188
- Would you do me the honor?
- Wait a minute.

356
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:56,196
Right this way.

357
00:25:56,371 --> 00:25:57,861
Hi, Hank.

358
00:25:58,073 --> 00:26:00,166
Hello, Joe.
I'd like you to meet Miss Blake.

359
00:26:00,342 --> 00:26:02,469
Tony's intended.

360
00:26:03,211 --> 00:26:05,145
How about a little service?

361
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,871
Two.

362
00:26:07,515 --> 00:26:09,312
- Dallas.
- Huh?

363
00:26:09,684 --> 00:26:11,151
It's a lady.

364
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:14,152
- Well, I know it's a lady.
- A lady shouldn't drink at bars.

365
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,984
Well, then, I'll take her to a table.
Right this way.

366
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:20,218
This table's sort of a mess here.

367
00:26:21,396 --> 00:26:24,957
- Listen to me...
- Hey, Joe, buy Hank a drink, will you?

368
00:26:30,305 --> 00:26:33,968
Heh. Drinks for everybody. On me.

369
00:26:36,144 --> 00:26:38,203
- Tony, where's Steve?
- What?

370
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,348
- What's the matter?
- He's in big trouble.

371
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,609
There's a guy came in here
yesterday morning, and...

372
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:04,035
- Where's Steve Sinclair?
- He ain't here.

373
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,604
The...

374
00:27:05,774 --> 00:27:08,743
This here's his brother, Tony Sinclair.

375
00:27:11,446 --> 00:27:13,277
He won't do.

376
00:27:30,932 --> 00:27:34,800
If you got business with my brother,
maybe I could deliver the message.

377
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:38,969
Well, I'll tell you, I never like
to send a boy out on a man's job...

378
00:27:39,174 --> 00:27:40,698
...so I'll deliver my own message.

379
00:27:42,944 --> 00:27:45,242
That was an offer, mister.

380
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:48,211
Now let's just say I'm telling you.

381
00:27:49,984 --> 00:27:52,578
I think you better give me
that message.

382
00:27:55,223 --> 00:27:57,555
Keep your hands off.
Nobody's inviting a draw.

383
00:27:57,726 --> 00:28:00,490
Somebody educate this kid
to keep his own gun hand inside.

384
00:28:00,695 --> 00:28:02,390
Kid's name is Tony.

385
00:28:02,564 --> 00:28:04,896
- Maybe you didn't hear.
- I heard.

386
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,063
Then say it.

387
00:28:09,337 --> 00:28:12,500
Sonny, why don't you take
a flying jump at the moon?

388
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,899
Boy, you're making it hard, drifter.

389
00:28:17,078 --> 00:28:18,909
I ain't meaning to.

390
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,277
I know what I like and don't like.
And I don't like Steve Sinclair.

391
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,816
I'd like to tell him that myself.

392
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,783
Now, if you wanna register a complaint,
you go right ahead, sonny.

393
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,116
Tony.

394
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,225
Hmm.

395
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,355
I think you'd better
stand clear, mister.

396
00:28:36,531 --> 00:28:38,431
It's reached that, huh?

397
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,830
That's the idea.

398
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,435
Unless you'd like to apologize.

399
00:28:44,606 --> 00:28:46,039
Tony.

400
00:29:02,524 --> 00:29:04,458
You got quite a lip, sonny.

401
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,624
Look, boys, Mr. Deneen
don't want gun play here.

402
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,321
There won't be any gun play, Joe.

403
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,524
If the drifter here wants to back off.

404
00:29:18,273 --> 00:29:19,865
I'm waiting for the word, gunner.

405
00:29:20,475 --> 00:29:22,500
Now you're making it hard, sonny.

406
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,337
I'm waiting.

407
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,139
You fast, little friend?

408
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,645
Boy, you got a good chance
to find out.

409
00:29:29,784 --> 00:29:32,309
- Oh, you want me to draw?
- You got the guts?

410
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,487
I got the guts and the know-how
to puncture your belly six times...

411
00:29:36,658 --> 00:29:37,989
...before you could breathe.

412
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,217
Tony!

413
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:55,899
Oh.

414
00:30:22,971 --> 00:30:25,565
Hey, Steve. He was...

415
00:30:25,773 --> 00:30:28,037
What's the matter with you?

416
00:30:28,977 --> 00:30:32,413
Tony, look, there wasn't an hour
in the year he couldn't outdraw you.

417
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:36,849
That's Larry Venables.
He was the fastest gun I ever knew.

418
00:30:48,897 --> 00:30:51,365
He was gunning for you, Steve.

419
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:00,605
Tony, I'm obliged for the service.

420
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,437
The next time somebody comes
into town looking for me...

421
00:31:03,912 --> 00:31:05,641
...call me, not him.

422
00:31:05,813 --> 00:31:07,747
Is that all you got to say, Steve?

423
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:09,383
I said I was obliged to you.

424
00:31:09,584 --> 00:31:11,814
He ain't asking you for no medal.

425
00:31:11,986 --> 00:31:15,080
This is Sinclair talk.
Your name Sinclair?

426
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,492
I'm only asking you
to remember one thing.

427
00:31:20,662 --> 00:31:24,359
In every gun fight, there's one who
walks to the bar and buys the drinks...

428
00:31:24,532 --> 00:31:27,592
...and there's the other
who gets his name carved into a stone.

429
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:30,499
At best, the odds are 50-50, Tony.

430
00:31:30,672 --> 00:31:32,606
Okay, Steve.

431
00:31:33,608 --> 00:31:36,338
I'll go tell the old man.

432
00:31:37,412 --> 00:31:39,107
Steve.

433
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:43,347
Was Venables faster than you?

434
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:56,457
Tony, take me out of here, will you?

435
00:31:56,631 --> 00:31:57,791
Sure.

436
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,058
Tony.

437
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,864
Let's go now. Please.

438
00:32:05,073 --> 00:32:08,065
Sure, now. I just want a drink first.

439
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:14,446
In a minute, Joan.
Just give me a minute.

440
00:32:22,056 --> 00:32:24,752
This here is my boy.

441
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:27,519
If we'd had him in gray,
Jeff Davis'd be president...

442
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,322
...the capital would be Richmond.

443
00:32:29,497 --> 00:32:31,226
How about that, Tony?

444
00:32:31,566 --> 00:32:36,265
Oh, don't you worry about Steve.
He's just a little bit jealous, that's all.

445
00:32:36,471 --> 00:32:38,530
It's been good shooting
going on here today.

446
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,435
He's just a little bit jealous, huh?

447
00:32:40,608 --> 00:32:42,371
How about that?
How about that, Tony?

448
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,568
I wanna buy drinks for all these men.

449
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:47,179
- Well...
- I want these men to have drinks on me.

450
00:32:47,348 --> 00:32:49,680
Where did you learn
to shoot like that, Tony?

451
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:52,046
Pretty fast gun he's got there.
Look at that.

452
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,781
And the boy that used it
ain't so slow either. Let me see it.

453
00:32:56,591 --> 00:32:58,616
- Give me that gun.
- Tony, will you?

454
00:32:58,793 --> 00:33:01,193
- Just one second, Tony, please?
- Give me that gun.

455
00:33:01,362 --> 00:33:03,227
- All right, Tony.
- Well, now.

456
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,595
Let's get all these drinks out here,
and I got a proposal to make.

457
00:33:06,768 --> 00:33:08,759
Here. I give you a toast to...

458
00:33:08,936 --> 00:33:10,767
It ain't every day you kill somebody.

459
00:33:10,938 --> 00:33:12,405
Tony Sinclair, huh?

460
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:16,272
- More valuables for you. Free whiskey.
MAN 4: All right.

461
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,316
Howdy, Steve.
I heard your crew got back.

462
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,249
- Where's Mr. Deneen, Brick?
- Inside.

463
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,413
Tell him I'm here, will you?

464
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,558
Sure, but what's the trouble?

465
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:34,718
There's been a gunfight in town.
A man is dead.

466
00:33:44,138 --> 00:33:45,730
What's it about, Steve?

467
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,075
There's been a shooting, Mr. Deneen.

468
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,912
There's been a killing, Brick tells me.

469
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,446
His name was Larry Venables.

470
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:55,809
He was gunning for me.

471
00:33:55,983 --> 00:33:58,747
A long time ago,
I had to kill his brother.

472
00:33:59,353 --> 00:34:01,583
And now you had to kill him.

473
00:34:01,756 --> 00:34:02,814
Tony had to kill him.

474
00:34:03,057 --> 00:34:04,684
Tony?

475
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,284
Oh, you're here to defend him.
Is that it?

476
00:34:07,762 --> 00:34:09,286
No. I'm here to explain it.

477
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,763
Maybe I didn't make myself clear,
Mr. Deneen.

478
00:34:12,934 --> 00:34:14,959
A man rode into town
to gun me down.

479
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,603
Killing him was a service.

480
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:21,702
You'll forgive me if I don't choose to
argue the fine points of what we call it.

481
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:25,107
I want to ask you how does
your brother feel after having killed...

482
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,803
...his first human being?

483
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,949
Healthier than if he'd turned his back.

484
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:33,814
And what if he'd turned the other cheek
and not been eager to reach for the gun?

485
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,649
I think you ask a lot, Mr. Deneen.

486
00:34:36,624 --> 00:34:38,148
Do I?

487
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,955
I asked the same of my own son
before you rode into this valley.

488
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:44,325
He was young like Tony.

489
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,559
And they brought him back to my ranch
one Sunday afternoon...

490
00:34:47,735 --> 00:34:51,330
...flung over a saddle
like a sack of bloody meat.

491
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,337
Just 19.

492
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,409
He died before he knew
very much about living.

493
00:34:56,811 --> 00:34:57,869
Do I ask too much?

494
00:35:00,214 --> 00:35:03,411
- No, I guess not.
- You don't have to guess.

495
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:06,883
This is as near to the law
as there will ever be around here.

496
00:35:07,054 --> 00:35:08,851
Gunmen are not welcome.

497
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,914
You're talking about my brother.

498
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:14,424
I'm talking about a young man
and a gun and first blood.

499
00:35:14,629 --> 00:35:18,360
And when it applies to Tony,
it makes me break out into a cold sweat.

500
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,366
You can tell your brother from me
that if he kills again...

501
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,266
...I don't want him in this valley.

502
00:35:24,438 --> 00:35:27,532
I have to take that
as if it were said for both of us.

503
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,539
It is said to both of you.

504
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,177
But it's said to you, Steve...

505
00:35:31,345 --> 00:35:34,371
...because I don't wanna live through
another Sunday afternoon.

506
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,518
I don't want to see you
draped over a saddle.

507
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:41,044
I'd rather send a son of mine riding
and never see him again...

508
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,213
...than have to bury him.

509
00:35:44,525 --> 00:35:46,459
Try to understand that, Steve.

510
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,059
For my sake.

511
00:35:50,031 --> 00:35:52,431
You can count on it, Mr. Deneen.

512
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,801
It took a lot for him
to come here and tell you that.

513
00:36:04,979 --> 00:36:08,039
You picked him right. But the brother?

514
00:36:08,983 --> 00:36:11,952
I know all about the brother
and the sickness inside him.

515
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:14,587
He didn't get that from Steve.
He was born with it.

516
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,746
I don't think that Tony
ever did get born.

517
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:20,087
I think that somebody just found him
wedged into a gun cylinder...

518
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,094
...and shot him out into the world
by pressing a trigger.

519
00:36:24,799 --> 00:36:25,891
Remember that girl?

520
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:28,627
When the man gets
out of these, get more drinks.

521
00:36:28,803 --> 00:36:32,432
Do you remember her?
And Dallas snatching anybody.

522
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:39,971
You know, every time we get
together, it is the greatest...

523
00:36:40,147 --> 00:36:41,774
I bargain the lady had no gun.

524
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,974
Tony's still in there?

525
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,420
And having a wonderful time.

526
00:36:49,523 --> 00:36:51,821
Hey, wait a minute, will you?

527
00:36:51,993 --> 00:36:55,656
I've got him down, I shot him.
He's cold dead.

528
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:59,222
Come on.
I'll take you back to the place.

529
00:37:28,863 --> 00:37:30,660
You all right?

530
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:35,128
Don't worry about me.

531
00:37:35,703 --> 00:37:38,536
Haven't you ever seen
a woman cry before?

532
00:37:38,706 --> 00:37:40,571
I guess I have.

533
00:37:41,275 --> 00:37:44,642
That was rough back there.
I don't blame you.

534
00:37:44,812 --> 00:37:47,906
I don't think a death
ever goes down easy.

535
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:53,319
Well, I'm sorry you had to see it.

536
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:57,924
So we understand each other and so you
don't fall off looking for the right word...

537
00:37:58,092 --> 00:38:00,583
...I don't want your sympathy.

538
00:38:00,795 --> 00:38:04,094
This isn't the first time
I've been left alone in a saloon.

539
00:38:04,298 --> 00:38:07,529
- They breed you tough, don't they?
- Now do me a favor, will you?

540
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,499
Go riding and leave me alone.

541
00:38:26,253 --> 00:38:30,246
I told you I was gonna take you back
to the ranch. I'm not about to leave you.

542
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:33,458
I'm gonna give you this just once,
Mr. Sinclair.

543
00:38:33,694 --> 00:38:37,289
The people here may call you boss
and the cattle may wear your brand...

544
00:38:37,465 --> 00:38:39,433
...but I'm not part of the stock.

545
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,363
Now, you listen to me.

546
00:38:41,535 --> 00:38:45,403
Tony isn't just any kid with an eye
for pretty legs and a soft voice.

547
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:49,475
This is a kid who saw a half dozen men
shot down before he was 12 years old.

548
00:38:49,643 --> 00:38:53,374
His god happened to be his brother,
and is responsible for five of those men.

549
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:56,979
If this kid doesn't come with a halo,
that's too bad.

550
00:38:57,451 --> 00:39:01,080
Nobody tied you to that buckboard.
Nobody dragged you in here with a rope.

551
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:04,247
If you were dumb or miserable enough
to follow a kid's grin...

552
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:08,088
...then weep for your own problems,
don't hate us for ours.

553
00:39:21,175 --> 00:39:23,166
I'm sorry, Joan.

554
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:26,575
I'm sorry it wasn't what you wanted.

555
00:39:26,747 --> 00:39:28,874
Or that we're not what you want.

556
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,314
Come here.
I wanna show you something.

557
00:39:44,265 --> 00:39:47,632
When Tony was a kid, real little,
he used to play here.

558
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,669
This was his hiding place, he called it.

559
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:55,268
I whaled the tar out of him because
he broke my good knife doing that.

560
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,641
That's the way of the world.

561
00:39:57,845 --> 00:40:00,507
They grow up on you
when your back's turned...

562
00:40:00,681 --> 00:40:04,117
...and you can't link what you remember
with what you see.

563
00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:08,187
I see Tony, 12 years old,
carving his name in that tree.

564
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:13,050
I don't see the kid back in the saloon
with a bottle and a bloody floor.

565
00:40:14,695 --> 00:40:17,220
I'm not used to giving an inch, Steve.

566
00:40:17,431 --> 00:40:21,663
I haven't given you any room at all.
I haven't even tried to understand.

567
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,361
I wish you'd give me
a little room now.

568
00:40:24,538 --> 00:40:25,630
Let me try.

569
00:40:27,141 --> 00:40:28,733
Sure.

570
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:32,077
It's a big valley, plenty of room.

571
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:47,726
What's that?

572
00:40:47,962 --> 00:40:49,486
I don't know.

573
00:40:49,663 --> 00:40:51,153
I think we better find out.

574
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,524
Clay, no trouble, please.

575
00:41:18,692 --> 00:41:20,057
You gonna fight them, Pa?

576
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:22,922
I hope not, but I will if I have to.

577
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:25,030
You better wait here, Joan.

578
00:41:48,722 --> 00:41:50,053
Who's in charge here?

579
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:51,883
Who wants to know?

580
00:41:58,332 --> 00:42:01,893
My name's Sinclair.
You're on somebody else's land.

581
00:42:02,469 --> 00:42:05,666
Well, I see that different.
We have a right to be here.

582
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,538
For what reason? Hunting?

583
00:42:09,577 --> 00:42:10,805
That depends on you.

584
00:42:13,647 --> 00:42:15,478
I came here friendly.

585
00:42:15,649 --> 00:42:17,617
A pointed gun
gets my back up, mister.

586
00:42:17,818 --> 00:42:20,946
- Be careful, will you, Clay?
- I don't need to be careful.

587
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:23,612
We're on here legal,
and we stay on here.

588
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,656
I didn't bring you from Pennsylvania...

589
00:42:25,826 --> 00:42:29,023
...to scurry away the minute
somebody rides in with a raised voice.

590
00:42:29,196 --> 00:42:31,096
We're here legal, we stay here.

591
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:33,360
You're twice wrong.

592
00:42:33,567 --> 00:42:37,298
You didn't take this land legally,
you squatted on it. You're not staying.

593
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,996
Now, you better hear me out.

594
00:42:40,174 --> 00:42:43,632
- This land belonged to my...
- This land belonged to Jacob Ellison.

595
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,507
He lost two herds from the winter,
and then he went East.

596
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,011
That was 20 years ago.

597
00:42:48,182 --> 00:42:52,278
We've had free trespass across this strip
since I've been here, and before that.

598
00:42:52,886 --> 00:42:54,444
My name is Clay Ellison.

599
00:42:55,689 --> 00:42:58,089
My father died
and the land is in my name now.

600
00:42:59,727 --> 00:43:02,855
All right, mister.
You wanna try and put us off?

601
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:05,828
I mean to talk sense to you, that's all.
You make your own decision.

602
00:43:08,135 --> 00:43:09,397
You see up there?

603
00:43:10,037 --> 00:43:11,834
There's a storm coming up.

604
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:16,032
You get a lot of rain here, this draw
you're camping in will be full of water.

605
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,404
You picked a bad spot.

606
00:43:17,611 --> 00:43:18,669
There are others.

607
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:21,371
This strip runs six miles.
We'll find another spot.

608
00:43:21,548 --> 00:43:24,574
Not around here.
This isn't farming country.

609
00:43:24,752 --> 00:43:26,344
We'll make out.

610
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,421
Even if you do, there's cattle north
and cattle south of you.

611
00:43:29,623 --> 00:43:31,921
Never saw a cow that could tell
the difference...

612
00:43:32,126 --> 00:43:34,321
...between young grass
and young wheat.

613
00:43:34,495 --> 00:43:37,157
You ever hear of fences, Mr. Sinclair?

614
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:48,005
I'll give this to you just once, Ellison.

615
00:43:48,175 --> 00:43:51,611
This is cow country.
A lot of good men made it cow country.

616
00:43:51,779 --> 00:43:53,872
And that wasn't done
just so that one day...

617
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:57,779
...you could come in here and stick up
a lot of fences and bleed us to death.

618
00:43:58,419 --> 00:44:00,444
This deed
says the land belongs to me.

619
00:44:00,654 --> 00:44:02,053
I can do what I want with it.

620
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,019
It's the law. The government says it.

621
00:44:04,191 --> 00:44:07,285
You can frame that and hang it,
but it won't raise crops for you.

622
00:44:07,461 --> 00:44:09,452
We made a bad decision
coming here, Clay.

623
00:44:09,697 --> 00:44:11,597
We'll make a better one if we go?

624
00:44:11,765 --> 00:44:13,733
There's a storm coming like he says.

625
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:17,268
I'm tired, Clay. My kids are tired.

626
00:44:17,438 --> 00:44:21,807
Take your time. It may be muddy,
but you'll be able to move out.

627
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,941
You're a Texan, aren't you?

628
00:44:28,282 --> 00:44:30,614
You're not far wrong,
I was raised there. Laredo.

629
00:44:31,185 --> 00:44:33,244
I figured from the saddle.

630
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,480
- You got something against Texas?
- Not anymore.

631
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:40,490
But I had to shoot a number of your
brethren when they were wearing gray.

632
00:44:40,694 --> 00:44:43,663
Then what's your complaint, mister?
You won, didn't you?

633
00:44:43,831 --> 00:44:45,298
I wonder sometimes.

634
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,130
Look, don't bring
that rag of a uniform out here...

635
00:44:49,336 --> 00:44:51,167
...and expect to win battles with it.

636
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:55,240
There won't be any bugles.
Just move out when you see the sun.

637
00:44:58,979 --> 00:45:00,503
Hey, you.

638
00:45:03,584 --> 00:45:06,485
We're not beholden to you
for the right to live and breathe.

639
00:45:06,653 --> 00:45:09,486
We've been frozen and roasted
and half sick to death...

640
00:45:09,656 --> 00:45:13,319
...so it's gonna take more than you
to make us pull out, you hear that?

641
00:45:13,494 --> 00:45:14,586
More than you.

642
00:45:14,762 --> 00:45:16,923
More than your kind.
Do you hear me, Sinclair?

643
00:45:17,097 --> 00:45:19,327
Do you hear me? Do you?

644
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:29,805
Please, we've had kind of hard times.

645
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:32,604
He's not himself.

646
00:45:34,047 --> 00:45:35,947
Get a night's sleep.

647
00:45:36,116 --> 00:45:39,779
But in the morning,
you be up and out of here.

648
00:46:00,073 --> 00:46:01,131
Heeee!

649
00:46:01,308 --> 00:46:02,639
- Hey, Dal.
- Huh?

650
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:07,509
- You got anything to drink?
- No, I ain't got anything to drink.

651
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,205
- Hey, Dal.
- What?

652
00:46:09,383 --> 00:46:10,645
How fast?

653
00:46:10,818 --> 00:46:12,649
How fast do you think I drew?

654
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:15,380
- Huh?
- How much ahead of him was I?

655
00:46:15,556 --> 00:46:18,650
I swear, I thought he had his gun out
even with mine.

656
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,486
What difference does it make?

657
00:46:20,661 --> 00:46:22,925
You left him back there on his face,
didn't you?

658
00:46:23,096 --> 00:46:24,893
You're fast, didn't you know that?

659
00:46:25,098 --> 00:46:27,931
Did you ever see a man fall like that?
Heh.

660
00:46:28,101 --> 00:46:29,728
I never saw a man fall like that.

661
00:46:29,937 --> 00:46:32,337
Ha-ha. I never did.

662
00:46:33,307 --> 00:46:34,797
Ah.

663
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:41,412
- That's smoke.
- Squatters' smoke.

664
00:46:41,582 --> 00:46:44,551
Smack dab in the middle of the strip.

665
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,619
- Hey.
- Oh, get out.

666
00:46:47,821 --> 00:46:49,914
You thinking what I'm thinking?

667
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:51,182
You like squatters?

668
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:54,725
Well, look, I don't like squatters
any more than I like Venables.

669
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,886
- You know how much I like Venables.
- Yeah.

670
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,089
Well, now, let's make them unsquat.

671
00:46:59,266 --> 00:47:01,063
- Let's do. Hah!
- Git, boy.

672
00:47:01,768 --> 00:47:04,896
Come on, squatters. Yow!

673
00:47:05,105 --> 00:47:06,697
Yee-hee-hee-hee!

674
00:47:07,107 --> 00:47:09,974
- Aah-ha!
- Don't worry, Mary.

675
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,213
Yee-hee-hee-hee!

676
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,211
Haa-haa!

677
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,808
- Hey, Dal.
- Yeah?

678
00:47:17,985 --> 00:47:19,077
What are we gonna do?

679
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,483
I don't know.
Whatever we're doing, do it slow.

680
00:47:21,655 --> 00:47:23,054
Well, let's go, daddy.

681
00:47:25,392 --> 00:47:26,586
Yee-ho!

682
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,557
Hey, squatters.

683
00:47:31,632 --> 00:47:33,463
Hey, Dal.
Yeah?

684
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:34,998
You got something to drink?

685
00:47:35,168 --> 00:47:37,432
I ain't got nothing.
You got anything to drink?

686
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:40,596
No, I ain't got anything.
I bet he's got something to drink.

687
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:42,105
What makes you think so?

688
00:47:42,576 --> 00:47:44,407
Ooh. Somebody told me.

689
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:47,171
-Who?
-Somebody.

690
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:50,479
-Let's ask him.
-Let's do.

691
00:47:52,653 --> 00:47:56,487
Tony, I think we found ourselves
a plum here.

692
00:47:56,657 --> 00:47:58,989
Not only is this man
a squatter and pig farmer...

693
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:01,957
...but I do believe I detect
what was once a Yankee uniform.

694
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:06,094
What was on the shoulders? Maybe
you were General Grant's adjutant.

695
00:48:06,266 --> 00:48:09,531
I was a brevet major
with the 5th Pennsylvanians, rebel.

696
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:11,761
If you was at Cemetery Ridge,
you'd know.

697
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,496
Cemetery Ridge.

698
00:48:13,674 --> 00:48:16,336
Now, let me review that in my mind.

699
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:19,843
Wasn't that the place where
the Federals was all lined up in a row...

700
00:48:20,013 --> 00:48:23,540
...and when they seen the first man in
gray uniform charging up to them...

701
00:48:23,717 --> 00:48:25,480
...didn't they take off like rabbits?

702
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:28,348
I believe there was two regiments
that was never heard from again.

703
00:48:29,923 --> 00:48:33,222
And I bet this fellow here,
he was the fastest one of the bunch.

704
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,687
Uh-oh.
Here he comes. Look at him.

705
00:48:35,862 --> 00:48:38,695
- He's a big one.
- He sure is a big one.

706
00:48:41,535 --> 00:48:44,197
You got 15 seconds
to get off my land, rebels.

707
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:46,829
You know something, mister?

708
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:50,807
You got a big fat Yankee mouth on you.
And I'm gonna close it for you.

709
00:48:55,649 --> 00:48:58,174
They're going down.

710
00:49:16,169 --> 00:49:19,002
Yeah, let's go.

711
00:49:34,688 --> 00:49:36,485
Go ahead, Pa. Pick it up.

712
00:49:38,625 --> 00:49:39,683
Watch him, Dal.

713
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,953
- Watch him.
- oh-hoo-hoo.

714
00:49:42,129 --> 00:49:43,687
Watch him, now.

715
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:45,194
Come on, come on.

716
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,525
Go ahead, Pa.

717
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:51,496
You better get away from Pa, son.
Get away.

718
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,733
Say it like you meant it, mister.

719
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:56,740
Say it like you didn't know
that kid was keeping you alive.

720
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,138
Jamie.

721
00:49:59,146 --> 00:50:01,410
- Look. Look at him.
- Oh-ho-ho-ho.

722
00:50:04,718 --> 00:50:05,980
Hey, that's it. That's it.

723
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:07,484
Go on, Pa. Dance for me.

724
00:50:08,789 --> 00:50:10,416
Come on. Ho-ho-ho.

725
00:50:10,624 --> 00:50:12,819
- Pick it up, Pa.
- Come on dance, Pa.

726
00:50:13,026 --> 00:50:14,926
Come on dance.

727
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:18,655
Please, Pa.

728
00:50:18,899 --> 00:50:20,799
Dance, Pa.

729
00:50:23,136 --> 00:50:25,070
Aah! Ha-ha-ha!

730
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,955
Tony. Tony.

731
00:50:57,938 --> 00:51:00,566
If you weren't drunk, I'd...

732
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,768
Now, get out of here, Tony.

733
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,524
Next time, I'll kill you, squatter.

734
00:51:35,742 --> 00:51:36,834
Get up, Dallas.

735
00:51:42,249 --> 00:51:45,082
I'll give you just a minute and a half
to get out of sight.

736
00:51:45,252 --> 00:51:48,312
And don't stop in town,
just keep on going.

737
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:53,716
Ellison.

738
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,186
That will pay for the wagon
and then some.

739
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,525
Don't let it delay
your getting out of here.

740
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:01,929
If that money
would pay for a wagon...

741
00:52:02,135 --> 00:52:06,902
...it will also pay for some wire
to keep you and your animals out.

742
00:52:37,771 --> 00:52:39,136
Are you Dennis Deneen?

743
00:52:39,306 --> 00:52:41,900
I'm his foreman.
What do you wanna see him about?

744
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:43,167
Who is it, Brick?

745
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,874
Ellison. Clay Ellison.

746
00:52:46,713 --> 00:52:48,806
Have him come in, Brick.

747
00:53:01,228 --> 00:53:03,128
I've been expecting you.

748
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:05,992
I heard all about what happened
over at your camp.

749
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:09,293
- I'm sorry.
- How sorry, Mr. Deneen?

750
00:53:09,469 --> 00:53:12,267
My father told me you ran this valley.

751
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,963
But he said you had principles.

752
00:53:14,207 --> 00:53:15,970
Mister, you'd best mind what you're...

753
00:53:16,142 --> 00:53:17,632
Just a minute, Brick.

754
00:53:18,345 --> 00:53:20,142
Go ahead, Ellison. Make your point.

755
00:53:20,814 --> 00:53:23,681
I wanna know if that's all
I can expect from you. Apologies.

756
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:25,647
What more did you have in mind?

757
00:53:25,852 --> 00:53:27,843
Your assurance
that it won't happen again.

758
00:53:29,022 --> 00:53:31,252
I give you my guarantee.

759
00:53:31,424 --> 00:53:33,984
All you have to do
is sell me your land, Mr. Ellison.

760
00:53:34,227 --> 00:53:36,252
I'll pay whatever you ask.

761
00:53:36,429 --> 00:53:40,661
Listen, Mr. Deneen, I'm not gonna be
talked off, I'm not gonna be bullied off...

762
00:53:40,834 --> 00:53:42,961
...l'm not gonna be bought off.

763
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,627
I didn't come to you to sell my land.

764
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,170
I came here to protect it.

765
00:53:47,374 --> 00:53:50,468
You want to farm that strip
and you want to string wire.

766
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,703
In other words,
you want me at your elbow...

767
00:53:52,879 --> 00:53:54,437
...while you close up the range.

768
00:53:54,614 --> 00:53:57,811
Forgive me, Mr. Ellison,
but you've got a devil of a lot of gall.

769
00:53:58,351 --> 00:54:02,344
To want what's mine?
That's not gall, that's a man's right.

770
00:54:02,956 --> 00:54:06,221
And you place quite a stock
in a man's right, don't you?

771
00:54:06,393 --> 00:54:09,021
His right and his honor, Mr. Deneen.

772
00:54:09,195 --> 00:54:13,131
And I bought and paid for both
with this uniform.

773
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:16,633
At Chickamauga,
both Bull Runs, Chancellorsville.

774
00:54:16,803 --> 00:54:20,864
I had major's epaulets on my shoulders,
and they were earned.

775
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:24,066
No dirty range tramp...

776
00:54:24,277 --> 00:54:27,769
...can tell me there's no honor
to these names and to this uniform.

777
00:54:30,817 --> 00:54:33,411
I'm putting this right to you,
Mr. Deneen.

778
00:54:33,586 --> 00:54:38,649
I can't fight those men on their terms.
I'm not a gunman.

779
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,384
So I have to come
to the one human being...

780
00:54:41,561 --> 00:54:44,155
...who can keep me and mine alive.

781
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:47,393
Tomorrow morning,
I'm going into your town...

782
00:54:47,567 --> 00:54:51,936
...and I'm going to buy seed,
tools and wire.

783
00:54:53,406 --> 00:54:55,840
I'd like you to be there, Mr. Deneen...

784
00:54:56,009 --> 00:54:58,443
...to see that I won't need a casket
to go with it.

785
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:06,814
There are only two things
I've hated all my life, Ellison.

786
00:55:07,187 --> 00:55:10,588
One is violence,
and the other is barbed wire.

787
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:13,855
But I hate violence much more.

788
00:55:14,027 --> 00:55:17,053
Tomorrow morning, you stop by here
on your way to town...

789
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,528
...and Brick and I
will ride in with you.

790
00:55:19,699 --> 00:55:24,102
And no man is going to stop you
from doing whatever is your right.

791
00:55:49,629 --> 00:55:51,620
Hi, Steve.

792
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:53,360
I'm out of tobacco.

793
00:55:53,566 --> 00:55:55,329
That's the least of your worries.

794
00:55:55,502 --> 00:55:58,562
Get up on your feet, Tony.
I've got a lot to tell you.

795
00:55:59,406 --> 00:56:01,237
- Like what?
- Like this.

796
00:56:01,408 --> 00:56:03,569
You know what people think of you
around here?

797
00:56:03,743 --> 00:56:04,801
You think I care?

798
00:56:04,978 --> 00:56:07,674
They've got you pegged
as a gun-happy loco kid.

799
00:56:07,881 --> 00:56:10,975
That's what everybody's thought
since you shot your first rabbit.

800
00:56:11,151 --> 00:56:13,312
You could've walked
the street of that town...

801
00:56:13,486 --> 00:56:17,183
...and gotten 20 money bets the next
thing you killed would walk and talk.

802
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:19,187
You should've covered
their money then.

803
00:56:19,392 --> 00:56:21,519
I should've begged their pardon,
apologized...

804
00:56:21,694 --> 00:56:24,857
...because it was my brother
who made them wanna bolt their doors.

805
00:56:25,031 --> 00:56:27,329
How should I feel now, Steve?
You tell me.

806
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:30,799
I killed a top gun who'd bushwhack you
quicker than you can say your name.

807
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,631
Can't you let loose of a dead man?

808
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,831
Do you have to wear a carcass
like a medal?

809
00:56:35,008 --> 00:56:37,602
I'm not gonna get on my knees
and tell how sorry I am.

810
00:56:37,777 --> 00:56:40,371
That's what I'm not gonna do.
I saved your skin, buddy.

811
00:56:40,547 --> 00:56:43,983
It was me who stood up to him.
It was me who drew on him.

812
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:47,517
All you could do is take
a long slow crawl on your belly...

813
00:56:47,687 --> 00:56:49,985
...back to that old man.

814
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:55,158
Well, there's plenty who stood on line
to shake my hand this morning.

815
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,989
Couldn't wait for them, could you?

816
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,358
Then you had to ride out
digging up trouble.

817
00:56:59,532 --> 00:57:04,060
You were ready to gun down a farmer,
and maybe his wife and kids too.

818
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:08,796
You did okay. If you set out this morning
to prove to everybody right...

819
00:57:08,975 --> 00:57:12,172
...that you were a strutting,
itchy-fingered monster, you did okay.

820
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:13,835
You proved it.

821
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:16,243
I'll tell you what I proved.

822
00:57:16,449 --> 00:57:19,077
I proved that I was twice the gunman
you ever were.

823
00:57:19,252 --> 00:57:22,312
That I had stock in an open range
I was willing to fight for.

824
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,149
And I proved...

825
00:57:24,657 --> 00:57:28,821
I proved that you are jealous of me.

826
00:57:28,995 --> 00:57:33,329
Oh, boy, Steve,
you better open your eyes.

827
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,730
Because I'm not just a kid brother
anymore.

828
00:57:35,902 --> 00:57:40,202
I'm a full partner, I ride abreast to you.
And you're not sitting on me anymore.

829
00:57:40,406 --> 00:57:42,840
I never sat on you,
I never tied you down.

830
00:57:43,276 --> 00:57:46,109
I wanted one thing in my life.
That was to see you rise up.

831
00:57:46,346 --> 00:57:48,871
You only got up
as high as your gun belt...

832
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:51,744
...and that's a low height for a man.

833
00:57:57,790 --> 00:57:59,257
Oh.

834
00:57:59,759 --> 00:58:01,522
I am Dennis Deneen.

835
00:58:01,694 --> 00:58:05,130
This is Joan Blake, Mr. Deneen,
she's from Jeweltown.

836
00:58:05,298 --> 00:58:10,065
I'm honored,
but I have short business here tonight.

837
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,534
You can go ahead,
the lady can share it with us.

838
00:58:12,705 --> 00:58:14,036
Fair enough.

839
00:58:14,207 --> 00:58:16,266
I'd like to know
what yellow-backed bully...

840
00:58:16,442 --> 00:58:19,605
...tried to fire the camp
on the Ellison strip today.

841
00:58:20,647 --> 00:58:22,308
You're looking at him, Mr. Deneen.

842
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:26,644
A formidable act.

843
00:58:27,787 --> 00:58:30,449
I suppose
I'm in the presence of courage.

844
00:58:30,623 --> 00:58:33,285
It won't happen again, Mr. Deneen.
It's done with.

845
00:58:33,459 --> 00:58:34,721
It's done with?

846
00:58:34,894 --> 00:58:38,796
Is that the epitaph you put on the stone?
It's done with?

847
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:40,926
Well, you can take this as gospel.

848
00:58:41,568 --> 00:58:46,062
I won't have a man killed for one square
foot of soil or for an inch of it.

849
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:48,570
How about for an open range,
Mr. Deneen?

850
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:53,041
I must inform you, young Master Tony,
you did not invent the open range.

851
00:58:53,246 --> 00:58:55,680
All you've done is enjoyed it.

852
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:59,476
Clay Ellison is riding into town tomorrow
to get some supplies.

853
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:03,346
I'm in hopes that, eventually,
he'll sell out to us.

854
00:59:03,556 --> 00:59:06,024
But in the meantime,
he'll do as he will.

855
00:59:06,192 --> 00:59:10,629
That's his right,
and I'll back up his right.

856
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,832
It's been a pleasure meeting you,
miss.

857
00:59:17,003 --> 00:59:20,564
I'm sorry the circumstances
have been so strained.

858
00:59:22,108 --> 00:59:24,099
May you live a long and full life, Tony.

859
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,710
And may you beget a long line
of cattlemen.

860
00:59:27,447 --> 00:59:30,678
And may you live long enough
to raise them.

861
01:00:08,821 --> 01:00:10,152
Ahh.

862
01:00:11,824 --> 01:00:14,224
Ellison's coming into town
this morning.

863
01:00:14,394 --> 01:00:16,328
He's gonna buy wire.

864
01:00:16,496 --> 01:00:17,929
So they say.

865
01:00:18,131 --> 01:00:20,691
So we just step aside, huh?

866
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:23,062
Is that what we do, Hank?

867
01:00:23,236 --> 01:00:25,033
We just step aside...

868
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:29,106
...we bow him into the general store
where he buys wire to cut our throats.

869
01:00:29,275 --> 01:00:33,678
That ain't right, is it?
Is it right, Hank?

870
01:00:33,846 --> 01:00:37,782
Tony, you know we've gotta do
whatever Mr. Deneen says.

871
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:41,078
You've gotta do
whatever Mr. Deneen says.

872
01:00:41,254 --> 01:00:43,745
I don't care what he says.

873
01:00:48,361 --> 01:00:50,921
I wanna do things my way.

874
01:02:21,354 --> 01:02:23,049
You sure pick funny friends, Steve.

875
01:02:23,856 --> 01:02:25,756
You're standing right in the doorway.

876
01:02:25,958 --> 01:02:27,482
I could be moved.

877
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,489
Idea is, we don't wanna have to
make you move.

878
01:02:31,697 --> 01:02:33,494
Wait a minute, Brick.

879
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:35,258
Tony, I want you to back off.

880
01:02:35,968 --> 01:02:38,801
Why don't you tell that to Ellison,
Steve?

881
01:02:51,217 --> 01:02:52,878
Tony, I'm telling you to get back.

882
01:02:53,085 --> 01:02:55,645
And I'm telling you to say it to him.

883
01:02:55,822 --> 01:02:59,019
I got a list of supplies
to buy in that store there, Sinclair.

884
01:03:00,426 --> 01:03:01,916
You got wire on that list?

885
01:03:03,429 --> 01:03:05,021
At the top.

886
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,666
Then I think you better
change your mind.

887
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,228
Tony.

888
01:03:09,936 --> 01:03:12,234
You do it your way, Steve.
I'll do it mine.

889
01:03:12,405 --> 01:03:16,000
Squatter, you've got one more chance
to back off.

890
01:03:16,175 --> 01:03:17,369
One more chance.

891
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:20,804
You can go to hell.

892
01:03:29,422 --> 01:03:31,413
That's Cemetery Ridge.

893
01:03:35,261 --> 01:03:36,888
Tony.

894
01:03:40,533 --> 01:03:41,591
Tony, listen to me.

895
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:46,034
You're not fighting barbed wire
and squatters anymore.

896
01:03:46,205 --> 01:03:50,369
- Now you're fighting me.
- Not unless you make me, Steve.

897
01:03:50,543 --> 01:03:52,204
You're my brother.

898
01:03:52,378 --> 01:03:54,243
Or maybe you've forgotten that.

899
01:03:55,047 --> 01:03:57,880
No, I haven't forgotten that.
That's why I'm standing here.

900
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:00,883
That's why I'm gonna
stop you, Tony.

901
01:04:03,456 --> 01:04:04,923
Get out of my way, Sinclair.

902
01:04:05,124 --> 01:04:06,989
Nobody is stopping me.

903
01:04:07,159 --> 01:04:09,491
Nobody is buying any barbed wire.

904
01:04:09,662 --> 01:04:13,120
Why don't you let this squatter
fight his own fight, Steve?

905
01:04:13,299 --> 01:04:16,291
The other day, he was hiding
behind women and little kids.

906
01:04:16,802 --> 01:04:18,394
Today, he's hiding... Heh.

907
01:04:18,571 --> 01:04:21,267
That's very funny,
because he's hiding behind you.

908
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,898
It's funny because you don't know
that Steve's gone soft.

909
01:04:25,077 --> 01:04:28,274
And you're no protection for this slimy,
yellow-bellied, little...

910
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:16,022
This is one the two of you can share.
You and Tony.

911
01:05:26,238 --> 01:05:28,229
Charlie Harris.

912
01:05:29,542 --> 01:05:31,806
- Yes, sir.
- Can you read this?

913
01:05:32,878 --> 01:05:35,039
- Yes, sir.
- Well, if you can read it, fill it.

914
01:05:35,214 --> 01:05:38,342
Send it all over the Ellison strip.
I'll be there waiting for it.

915
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:40,144
- The wire too?
- Yes, all you have.

916
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:42,549
Perhaps you'd better send away
for more.

917
01:05:42,722 --> 01:05:44,349
After I wire the Ellison strip...

918
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:47,959
...l'll be doing the same thing
all along my property line.

919
01:05:58,404 --> 01:06:01,532
And if the wire isn't enough,
I'll use this.

920
01:06:03,075 --> 01:06:05,043
You're to keep your cattle
off my land.

921
01:06:05,911 --> 01:06:09,210
And I don't want anything I own
touched by you.

922
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,872
Harris.

923
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:13,917
If you want my business,
you can't do any for them.

924
01:06:14,086 --> 01:06:18,853
These two gunmen,
I want you away from this valley.

925
01:06:19,025 --> 01:06:20,925
Both of you.

926
01:06:23,262 --> 01:06:25,696
All right, Brick. Come on.

927
01:06:41,447 --> 01:06:44,314
The use of it,
you may have got from me...

928
01:06:44,517 --> 01:06:46,781
...but what about the love of it?

929
01:06:46,952 --> 01:06:49,250
Where did you get
the love of it, Tony?

930
01:06:57,797 --> 01:06:59,560
Steve.

931
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:01,657
Steve?

932
01:07:01,834 --> 01:07:03,961
What's the matter? You lonely?

933
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,337
You've got company, Tony.

934
01:07:06,539 --> 01:07:09,667
And if you get bored,
you can scalp him.

935
01:07:33,499 --> 01:07:35,763
All right. Start digging.

936
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:59,314
- Hamp. Hamp.
- Here I am, Steve.

937
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:02,825
Call everybody in.
I wanna see all the hands right away.

938
01:08:15,374 --> 01:08:18,138
They're wiring off the Ellison strip.

939
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:22,144
And after that, they're going to do
the same thing all along Deneen's line.

940
01:08:22,314 --> 01:08:24,680
You know there's a way
to stop that, Steve.

941
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:26,647
Not for me, there isn't.

942
01:08:26,819 --> 01:08:30,152
I got this land from the old man.
Tomorrow, it will go back to him.

943
01:08:30,322 --> 01:08:33,314
You can stay here, all of you,
and work for him just as before.

944
01:08:33,492 --> 01:08:34,652
Or you can pull out.

945
01:08:35,427 --> 01:08:39,261
I'll see you all draw a full month's pay
first thing in the morning.

946
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:43,233
I'll miss you.

947
01:08:44,069 --> 01:08:45,400
That's it, Hamp.

948
01:08:51,443 --> 01:08:53,604
I didn't want much.
I didn't want much at all.

949
01:08:53,779 --> 01:08:58,682
I just wanted him to walk
with his head up.

950
01:08:59,952 --> 01:09:02,352
I tried too hard, I guess.

951
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:06,221
Whatever's wrong with a man,
he tries to change with a kid coming up.

952
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:11,125
But it isn't right,
because he really does it for himself.

953
01:09:11,297 --> 01:09:14,357
- Steve.
- No, it's true.

954
01:09:14,533 --> 01:09:19,027
I tried to bend that kid a certain way,
tried to shape him.

955
01:09:19,205 --> 01:09:24,074
Like he was some kind of tough leather
I had to make soft.

956
01:09:24,677 --> 01:09:27,771
He didn't soften any.
He wasn't made that way.

957
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:31,181
This was rotten leather,
and it came apart.

958
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:37,780
Did it come from me?
Was it because of me?

959
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:45,063
Do you know what I think, Steve?

960
01:09:45,231 --> 01:09:48,064
I think everything good in him
came from you.

961
01:09:48,234 --> 01:09:51,135
I think when he smiled,
that came from you.

962
01:09:51,303 --> 01:09:55,637
And when he loved,
that was something you gave him.

963
01:10:06,652 --> 01:10:09,143
If you've got a reason to be here,
say it in a hurry.

964
01:10:09,321 --> 01:10:11,152
My gear. I came to collect my gear.

965
01:10:11,357 --> 01:10:12,915
Collect it and get out.

966
01:10:17,763 --> 01:10:19,424
You're getting the boot too, huh?

967
01:10:19,598 --> 01:10:23,090
I'm leaving because I want to, Tony.
No one's pushing me.

968
01:10:23,269 --> 01:10:26,534
Yeah, well, you're lucky.

969
01:10:28,874 --> 01:10:30,432
You don't mind if I take this?

970
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:34,272
Take everything you can carry.
The rest goes back to Deneen tomorrow.

971
01:10:34,446 --> 01:10:37,279
- What do you mean?
- Leave tonight, I leave in the morning.

972
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:39,982
Are you crazy?

973
01:10:40,786 --> 01:10:42,014
I've already told the men.

974
01:10:42,187 --> 01:10:44,781
They can stay and work for the old man
if they want.

975
01:10:44,957 --> 01:10:47,824
You're gonna toss it all away,
land, cattle, everything?

976
01:10:48,027 --> 01:10:50,461
That's right. Now get your gear.

977
01:10:52,798 --> 01:10:56,495
Oh, boy, Steve.
I thought you were number one.

978
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,068
You're nothing but a drifter.

979
01:10:58,304 --> 01:11:01,068
- You're nothing.
- Let him alone, Tony.

980
01:11:01,273 --> 01:11:04,367
Let him alone? I'll let him alone.

981
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:07,904
I wouldn't touch him with gloves.

982
01:11:19,992 --> 01:11:22,085
Hi, men.

983
01:11:23,062 --> 01:11:25,292
Hi, Red. How's the boy?

984
01:11:25,731 --> 01:11:29,189
There's been a lot of talk
about the old man taking over.

985
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:30,665
Forget it.

986
01:11:30,836 --> 01:11:33,066
This ranch is Sinclair-run.

987
01:11:33,238 --> 01:11:37,698
And as of now,
I'm the Sinclair that runs it.

988
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:44,338
Well, I can't speak for the others,
but I take my orders from Steve.

989
01:11:44,516 --> 01:11:48,077
- I'm sorry, Tony.
- Don't be sorry. You can leave tonight.

990
01:11:49,121 --> 01:11:50,554
Tony.

991
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:55,121
Are you asking or telling?

992
01:11:55,594 --> 01:11:57,824
If you're asking, the answer is no.

993
01:11:58,430 --> 01:12:00,193
And if I'm telling?

994
01:12:01,033 --> 01:12:03,900
Then the answer is,
let's hear Steve say it.

995
01:12:04,103 --> 01:12:06,799
Steve? Heh.
Steve heard the word "fence."

996
01:12:06,972 --> 01:12:09,236
I think that scared him a little.

997
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:12,309
The only thing you'll hear from Steve
is goodbye.

998
01:12:12,478 --> 01:12:15,140
- I figure that's his right.
- Well, it's not your right to figure.

999
01:12:17,116 --> 01:12:18,242
Steve's out. That's it.

1000
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,044
Senor Tony...

1001
01:12:20,219 --> 01:12:22,744
Now, look, Manuelo,
you have your job here.

1002
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:25,116
The rest of you men have yours.

1003
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:27,918
Now, if you wanna stay,
you'll have to remember...

1004
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:30,653
...that Steve nor Deneen
nor anybody...

1005
01:12:30,863 --> 01:12:33,764
...has anything to do
with the running of the Sinclair ranch.

1006
01:12:33,932 --> 01:12:35,900
I'm the only one you call mister.

1007
01:12:36,068 --> 01:12:39,595
You haven't packed your gear, Tony,
and you're a long way from your horse.

1008
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:42,104
I'm as close as I wanna be.

1009
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:44,765
You're not as close
as I want you to be.

1010
01:12:46,011 --> 01:12:48,639
I told you men
this land goes back to Deneen.

1011
01:12:48,814 --> 01:12:51,612
I also said
you could all keep your jobs.

1012
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:54,480
If anybody's got any doubts
about who's in charge here...

1013
01:12:54,653 --> 01:12:56,484
...l'm ready to clear up those doubts.

1014
01:12:56,655 --> 01:12:57,917
Whatever you say, Steve.

1015
01:12:58,090 --> 01:13:00,422
- We're with you, Steve.
- I won't let you down.

1016
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:13,601
Stay away from me, Tony.

1017
01:13:26,018 --> 01:13:29,454
If you still got this big yen to die,
die someplace else, away from me.

1018
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:32,419
I'm tired of digging graves.

1019
01:13:33,358 --> 01:13:34,825
All right, take it easy, Tony.

1020
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:37,723
- Relax, Tony.
- All right. All right.

1021
01:13:37,963 --> 01:13:40,523
I'm all right, I'm all right.

1022
01:13:53,879 --> 01:13:56,541
We'll see who runs this outfit.

1023
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:06,013
Come on. Giddap.

1024
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,222
What will become of him, Steve?

1025
01:14:11,396 --> 01:14:13,591
He'll keep on the way he's going.

1026
01:14:13,765 --> 01:14:18,395
He'll meet somebody faster with a gun,
because that's the way it happens.

1027
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:20,265
They'll bury him.

1028
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:24,437
If he's lucky, he'll have a marker,
if he isn't, it won't make a difference...

1029
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:27,101
...because there won't be anybody
to mourn him.

1030
01:14:28,046 --> 01:14:29,775
Except me.

1031
01:14:30,983 --> 01:14:32,883
I'll mourn him.

1032
01:14:47,132 --> 01:14:48,622
Come on.

1033
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:02,611
What's your pleasure,
young Mr. Sinclair?

1034
01:15:02,814 --> 01:15:04,975
I didn't come here
to talk about pleasure.

1035
01:15:05,150 --> 01:15:07,414
I came here
to talk about my business.

1036
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:13,821
Now, in case you didn't hear,
I run the Double S Ranch now...

1037
01:15:14,026 --> 01:15:17,553
...and my first order of business
is for you to get that fence down.

1038
01:15:18,063 --> 01:15:20,088
You're on my land. Get off.

1039
01:15:21,967 --> 01:15:23,730
At least you say it like a man.

1040
01:15:23,902 --> 01:15:25,392
Yes, but not to a man.

1041
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:29,096
I'm telling it
to a dirty, little, trigger-happy jackal...

1042
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:31,936
...without a heart in his body.

1043
01:15:32,844 --> 01:15:36,280
I can't say it much plainer than that,
Tony.

1044
01:15:36,481 --> 01:15:41,248
Well, in that case, Mr. Deneen,
I guess you better use that gun...

1045
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:43,980
...because I'm afraid
I might have to kill you.

1046
01:16:29,234 --> 01:16:32,863
Mr. Deneen's been shot.
It happened early this morning.

1047
01:16:33,105 --> 01:16:35,972
He's hurt pretty bad.

1048
01:16:36,508 --> 01:16:38,100
We know who did it.

1049
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:42,245
He couldn't have gone far, Steve.
He was hit.

1050
01:16:42,414 --> 01:16:45,577
We followed a blood trail
toward the hills, then it stopped.

1051
01:16:45,751 --> 01:16:47,616
We figured he'd come here.

1052
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,378
He didn't.

1053
01:16:50,889 --> 01:16:53,153
We're gonna keep on looking for him,
Steve.

1054
01:16:55,127 --> 01:16:58,358
If he's in trouble,
I think I know where he'd go.

1055
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:01,055
I'd be obliged
if you'd let me go after him, Brick.

1056
01:17:03,235 --> 01:17:05,726
I've been with that old man
for 38 years.

1057
01:17:07,239 --> 01:17:08,536
I love him too.

1058
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:12,938
Will you wear your gun?

1059
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:24,689
All right, Steve.

1060
01:17:30,228 --> 01:17:31,354
Wait for me.

1061
01:17:32,798 --> 01:17:34,595
I will.

1062
01:19:04,556 --> 01:19:06,183
- Tony?
- Huh!

1063
01:20:16,761 --> 01:20:18,558
Tony.

1064
01:20:23,735 --> 01:20:26,135
You didn't get very far.

1065
01:20:26,338 --> 01:20:29,034
I got a little bullet in my leg.

1066
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:31,599
Who did you bring with you?

1067
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:34,136
Nobody. I came alone.

1068
01:20:34,346 --> 01:20:36,211
Don't take any walk, Steve.

1069
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:39,107
It's no day to walk.

1070
01:20:39,851 --> 01:20:41,648
It's hot.

1071
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:46,113
Good day for a man to die.
He would never know the difference.

1072
01:20:46,992 --> 01:20:49,426
I'm coming for you, Tony.
I'm gonna take you back.

1073
01:20:49,628 --> 01:20:51,118
I'm not gonna let you, Steve.

1074
01:20:53,732 --> 01:20:57,099
Stay where you are.
Or I'll have to kill you.

1075
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:00,237
Steve, don't.

1076
01:21:00,438 --> 01:21:02,633
I'm asking you not to.

1077
01:21:02,874 --> 01:21:04,865
Please, Steve.

1078
01:21:05,877 --> 01:21:07,504
I'm gonna take you back, Tony.

1079
01:21:11,683 --> 01:21:13,082
And what if I don't go?

1080
01:21:31,036 --> 01:21:32,697
Tony.

1081
01:21:45,417 --> 01:21:47,351
Tony.

1082
01:21:53,358 --> 01:21:54,655
Heh.

1083
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:58,295
Steve, I had to protect you.

1084
01:21:58,463 --> 01:22:02,490
You couldn't kill your kid brother
because...

1085
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:04,828
- Steve.
- Yeah?

1086
01:22:32,397 --> 01:22:33,864
Did you find Tony?

1087
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:35,829
Yes.

1088
01:22:36,334 --> 01:22:38,199
What about Mr. Deneen?

1089
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:40,201
He's gonna pull through.

1090
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:43,239
When he's able to listen, tell him...

1091
01:22:44,009 --> 01:22:48,776
He's able to listen now, Steve.
I think he'd like to hear it from you.

1092
01:23:02,093 --> 01:23:04,561
I'm glad you're all right, Mr. Deneen.

1093
01:23:09,034 --> 01:23:10,296
Tony's dead.

1094
01:23:14,139 --> 01:23:17,438
Steve. Come back here.

1095
01:23:20,145 --> 01:23:24,104
Now, don't you start running away
from something you've already built.

1096
01:23:24,649 --> 01:23:28,278
I'm not gonna moralize and tell you
what happened is for the best.

1097
01:23:28,453 --> 01:23:30,080
But it has happened.

1098
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:33,053
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

1099
01:23:33,925 --> 01:23:36,826
There's a lot of work to do
in this valley.

1100
01:23:37,462 --> 01:23:40,920
And it's our valley, Steve,
remember that.

1101
01:23:41,633 --> 01:23:44,124
I'll be needing a lot of help.

1102
01:23:45,036 --> 01:23:46,833
I'd like you to stay.

1103
01:23:47,038 --> 01:23:48,938
I'll stay.

1104
01:23:50,909 --> 01:23:52,934
You better be getting back
to your place...

1105
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:56,478
...and let them know that the Sinclairs
are still in the business.
