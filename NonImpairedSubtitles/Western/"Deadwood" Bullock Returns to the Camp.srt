 <i>( theme music playing )</i>

00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:04,033
HER MAJESTY
AWAKES, HUH?

3
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:12,834
- ( urinating )
- COCKSUCKER'S
GONNA GRACE ME

4
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:16,400
WITH HIS FUCKING
PRESENCE THIS MORNING.

5
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,634
 <i>FUCKING</i>
 <i>MAGISTRATE CLAGETT</i>

6
00:02:18,634 --> 00:02:21,567
WILL IMPART TO ME
THE ATTITUDE TOWARDS
THE SETTLEMENT

7
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:25,667
OF HIM AND HIS FELLOW
LYING FUCKING THIEVES

8
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,734
AT THE TERRITORIAL
LEGISLATURE OF YANKTON.

9
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:32,868
HOW FUCKING MUCH
IT'S GONNA COST US
TO GET ANNEXED

10
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:36,667
WHEN THEY SIGN A TREATY
WITH THE FUCKING DIRT
WORSHIPERS, HUH?

11
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:41,501
HOW HARD IS THE LEGISLATURE
GONNA SQUEEZE OUR BALLS

12
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:46,234
WITH REGARD TO OUR TITLE
AND PROPERTIES, HUH?

13
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,634
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
TO THESE COCKSUCKERS,
BUT YOU HAVE TO.

14
00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:54,767
IN LIFE,

15
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:57,868
YOU HAVE TO DO A LOT
OF THINGS YOU DON'T
FUCKING WANT TO DO.

16
00:02:57,868 --> 00:03:01,801
MANY TIMES, THAT'S
WHAT THE FUCK LIFE IS--

17
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:05,267
ONE VILE FUCKING TASK
AFTER ANOTHER.

18
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:09,334
BUT DON'T
GET AGGRAVATED.

19
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:12,667
THEN THE ENEMY HAS YOU
BY THE SHORT HAIR.

20
00:03:17,601 --> 00:03:20,767
IT'LL BE DIFFERENT
AFTER THE ANNEXATION.

21
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,200
THAT'S ALL.

22
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,567
THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE AFRAID OF.

23
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:29,634
( sniffing )
EVERYTHING CHANGES.

24
00:03:29,634 --> 00:03:32,200
DON'T BE AFRAID.

25
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:38,534
I CAN HOPE--

26
00:03:38,534 --> 00:03:42,701
THOSE'LL BE APPEARING
ON A REGULAR BASIS.

27
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:44,734
NO.

28
00:03:44,734 --> 00:03:46,801
NO?

29
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:54,234
HOW'S YOUR ARM?

30
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,767
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

31
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,734
DON'T FUCKING TRY
DOING AWAY WITH YOURSELF
AGAIN, HUH?

32
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:27,834
GOOD MORNING,
GENTLEMEN.

33
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,834
THIS IS ELLSWORTH,
WHO FOUND THE GOLD
ON YOUR CLAIM.

34
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:33,534
- <i>HOW DO YOU DO,</i>
 <i> MR. ELLSWORTH?</i>
- PLEASURE.

35
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:37,234
- AND THIS IS SOPHIA.
- PLEASURE, SOPHIA.

36
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:41,400
I'M GRATEFUL
FOR YOUR EXPERTISE 
AND KEEN EYESIGHT.

37
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,567
LUCK'S WHAT YOU WANT
TO CONGRATULATE ME ON,
MRS. GARRET.

38
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:46,467
TILL YOU DECIDE HOW
YOU WANT DEVELOP IT,

39
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:48,434
ELLSWORTH CAN SPEND TIME
ENOUGH AT WAGES

40
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:50,033
ON YOUR CLAIM TO SUSTAIN
YOUR OWNERSHIP.

41
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,534
I NOD AS IF I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU JUST SAID.

42
00:04:53,534 --> 00:04:56,367
HE'LL EXPLAIN IT
ALL TO YOU.

43
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:59,133
MIGHT WE HAVE A WORD,
MR. BULLOCK?

44
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:08,634
I'M CERTAIN
MR. ELLSWORTH'S ARE
VERY CAPABLE HANDS,

45
00:05:08,634 --> 00:05:12,634
BUT I HOPE YOU'RE NOT
DISASSOCIATING YOURSELF
FROM MY AFFAIRS.

46
00:05:12,634 --> 00:05:15,567
I ALREADY GOT MY IMPRESSION
OF THIS FELLOW,
MRS. GARRET.

47
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:17,267
THIS MEETING'S
HOW YOU FORM YOURS.

48
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:18,767
I SEE.

49
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:20,834
THEN WE COMPARE NOTES
AND DECIDE HOW YOU PROCEED.

50
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:22,734
FINE.

51
00:05:22,734 --> 00:05:26,167
TOWARD A FUTURE POINT
WHEN YOU TELL ME MY THINKIN'S
SO CONSISTENTLY WRONGHEADED

52
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:29,100
IT'S A WASTE OF YOUR
VALUABLE TIME HAVING
TO DEAL WITH ME.

53
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,634
IN ANY CASE, I KNOW
YOU HAVE MANY CLAIMS
ON YOUR ATTENTION.

54
00:05:32,634 --> 00:05:35,434
A COUPLE.

55
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:37,634
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

56
00:05:37,634 --> 00:05:41,267
I'D LEAN MORE ON WHAT I FELT
ABOUT THIS FELLOW
THAN WHAT I SAW.

57
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:49,067
LATE AS USUAL.

58
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:51,901
I JUST COMES FROM
THE CREEK, MR. FARNUM.
WASHIN' MY PANTS.

59
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:53,868
A HABIT TO CULTIVATE.

60
00:05:53,868 --> 00:05:58,868
AND UNDER A ROCK DOWN
THERE, I FOUND OTHER PANTS
OF MINE I THOUGHT I'D LOST.

61
00:05:58,868 --> 00:06:02,634
BUT SEEIN' AS I GETS
DRUNK AND ON OCCASION
SHITS MYSELF,

62
00:06:02,634 --> 00:06:04,901
I FIGURED THAT
MUST BE HOW I LOST 'EM
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

63
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:07,767
I IMAGINE YOU MAKING
YOUR WAY FROM THE CREEK,

64
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,601
ROLLING INTO THE LOBBY
WHEN ALL OTHERS ARE ABED,

65
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:13,801
BARE-ASS NAKED
WITH SHIT STREAMING DOWN
THE BACKS OF YOUR LEGS.

66
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:17,667
SIR, NO.
IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE NIGHT
THAT MR. HICKOK WAS KILLED.

67
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,334
NOW I RECALL
THAT MR. HICKOK...

68
00:06:19,334 --> 00:06:21,601
HE GIVES UNTO
ME A LETTER FOR ME
TO PUT IN POST,

69
00:06:21,601 --> 00:06:24,200
BUT WHAT WITH ALL
THE HULLABALO AND ME
GETTIN' DRUNK,

70
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,834
I FORGOT ABOUT
THE WHOLE THING.

71
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:28,000
UNTIL I FOUND
MY PANTS.

72
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,133
DO YOU THINK
I'M GONNA TOUCH THAT?

73
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:32,367
NO, UH, I DIDN'T GET
MY PANTS WET,

74
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:34,667
NOR DID I
SOIL THE LETTER WHEN
I SOILED MYSELF.

75
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,234
THAT'S THE MIRACLE
OF IT, SIR.

76
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:39,501
SO I'M TO BELIEVE
THAT'S A LETTER WRITTEN
BY WILD BILL HICKOK

77
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:44,200
JUST BEFORE HIS MURDER
BY THE COWARD McCALL?

78
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,300
- JUST MINUTES
BEFORE, SIR.
- ADDRESSED TO WHOM?

79
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,300
HIS WIFE, SIR.

80
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,067
WELL, I ONLY HOPE
YOU HAVEN'T OPENED IT.

81
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:54,701
NO, SIR.

82
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:58,267
AT LEAST THAT ELIMINATES
TAMPERING FROM THE LIST.

83
00:06:58,267 --> 00:07:00,267
OF WHAT, SIR?

84
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:04,334
CRIMES IN WHICH YOUR
INEBRIATION AND SLOTH

85
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:07,734
AS MY EMPLOYEE HAS
IMPLICATED MY HOTEL,

86
00:07:07,734 --> 00:07:09,801
WHICH I WILL ATTEMPT
TO SHIELD YOU FROM

87
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:11,767
IN THE COURSE OF TRYING
TO EXTRICATE MYSELF.

88
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:15,534
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO EXTRICATE YOU, SIR.
I-- I DIDN'T--

89
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:19,667
JUST GIVE ME
THE CONFOUNDED LETTER!

90
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:21,801
- AND NONE OF THIS
HANGDOG LOOK.
- SIR.

91
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:24,734
- NOT A WORD OF
THIS TO ANYONE.
- YES, SIR.

92
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:32,434
MR. UTTER.
HEARTY CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR NEW VENTURE.

93
00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:35,767
TAKE A WHILE
TO FIND OUT IF THOSE
ARE WHAT'S IN ORDER.

94
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,968
BEING THIS IS THE FIRST
DAY OF MY ENTERPRISE,

95
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:45,834
I WORE THIS FROCK-COAT.

96
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,767
VERY FLATTERING.

97
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:51,033
YOU DON'T THINK
IT LOOKS STUPID?

98
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:52,667
NOT TO ME, NO.

99
00:07:54,734 --> 00:07:57,100
MR. DORITY ALL
OF A SUDDEN STUMBLED,

100
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,834
AND IN-- IN GRABBIN'
AT SCRUB TO STEADY HIM,

101
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:04,167
I SAW A COLOR BENEATH.

102
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,601
( chuckles )
AIN'T YOU A LITTLE DOLL.

103
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:10,400
SHE'S FORMED AN
INSTANT ATTACHMENT.

104
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,801
WELL, ANYWAYS, I'M GLAD
TO KEEP YOUR TITLE GOOD
WORKIN' THE SURFACE,

105
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:19,801
BUT THE QUARTZ
OUTCROP WE FOUND--

106
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:22,167
YOU'RE NOT GONNA KNOW
HOW RICH YOUR STRIKE IS

107
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:24,000
UNTIL YOU SINK
SOME SHAFTS.

108
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,200
NOW, I AIN'T EXPERT
PROSPECTIN' THAT WAY.

109
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,634
I'M A MAN WHO
WORKS IN CREEKS.

110
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:30,000
THANK YOU FOR
TELLING ME SO.

111
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,801
NOT BEIN' IMPERTINENT,

112
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:35,634
YOUR PEOPLE GONNA
HELP YOU WITH THIS?

113
00:08:35,634 --> 00:08:38,634
MY BROTHER AND MY FATHER
ARE AWARE OF MY SITUATION

114
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:40,834
AND MY HUSBAND'S
PARENTS.

115
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:44,434
I HAVE NO IDEA
AS TO THE PROSPECT
OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT.

116
00:08:44,434 --> 00:08:48,734
WELL, BLOOD DON'T
ALWAYS PROVE LOYALTY.

117
00:08:48,734 --> 00:08:52,100
BUT YOU'RE GONNA NEED
SOME PEOPLE ON YOUR SIDE,
MRS. GARRET,

118
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,000
'CAUSE I BELIEVE
YOU GOT A BIG ONE
ON YOUR HANDS.

119
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,667
I BELIEVE MR. BULLOCK'S
ON MY SIDE.

120
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:00,834
NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.

121
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:03,234
AND I BELIEVE
YOU ARE, TOO.

122
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:05,601
EXCUSE ME.

123
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:07,767
I WAS AMONG THEM
FOUND THAT LITTLE GIRL.

124
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:09,667
 <i>I'M GLAD TO SEE</i>
 <i>HER DOING WELL.</i>

125
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:12,133
I'M ALMA GARRET.

126
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:13,334
HOW DO YOU DO?

127
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:16,434
ELLSWORTH.

128
00:09:16,434 --> 00:09:17,801
CHARLIE UTTER.

129
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:21,267
- <i>( knocking )</i>
- COME IN.

130
00:09:21,267 --> 00:09:24,167
- Johnny: <i>YES, SIR.</i>
- YOU SEE THIS?

131
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:28,367
"UTTER FREIGHT AND POSTAL
DELIVERY SERVICE."

132
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,801
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOU DROP A FUCKING STITCH.

133
00:09:30,801 --> 00:09:33,701
WHAT STITCH
DID I DROP?

134
00:09:33,701 --> 00:09:35,601
I DID.

135
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:39,100
THIS FREIGHT AND DELIVERY
SERVICE SHOULD'VE BEEN OPENED
BY PERSIMMON PHIL

136
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,801
- AS A COVER FOR HIS OTHER
FUCKING ACTIVITIES.
- HE'S DEAD.

137
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:44,300
I KNOW HE'S DEAD NOW.

138
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,834
WELL, IF YOU DON'T KNOW,
NOBODY DOES.

139
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:50,601
I SHOULD HAVE
BROUGHT IN A REPLACEMENT,
IS MY FUCKING POINT.

140
00:09:50,601 --> 00:09:52,367
WELL, YOU'LL KNOW
BETTER NEXT TIME.

141
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:55,834
THE DIRECTION
OF MY THOUGHTS--

142
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:58,801
WITH THE SUSTAINED
FUCKING STUPIDITY THAT
YOU'RE EXHIBITING,

143
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:00,834
I HESITATE TO VOICE THEM--

144
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:05,033
IS THAT YOU MIGHT WANT
TO TRAIN FOR PHIL'S
FORMER POSITION.

145
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:07,234
AL.

146
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:10,167
I HAVE HOPED FOR
THIS CONVERSATION 

147
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:13,634
EVER SINCE YOU GIVE ME
THAT INDIAN HEAD TO HIDE.

148
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:33,367
HOW'D IT GO WITH JOHNNY?

149
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:37,534
I HAVE JUST FLED
MY OWN OFFICE IN HORROR

150
00:10:37,534 --> 00:10:41,133
AT HIS FUCKING
DIMWITTEDNESS.

151
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:43,868
WELL, PERSIMMON PHIL
WAS NO GENIUS.

152
00:10:43,868 --> 00:10:45,667
I KNOW.

153
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:47,734
AND JOHNNY, SO EAGER.

154
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:50,701
I KNOW.
WAS IT NOT MY FUCKING
IDEA TO ASK HIM?

155
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:54,667
THERE'S A MINIMAL STANDARD,
HE'LL BE IN THE WILDERNESS.

156
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,634
YOU GOTTA BE ABLE
TO SUSTAIN A THOUGHT.

157
00:10:56,634 --> 00:10:59,601
YOU GOTTA BE ABLE
TO REMEMBER FUCKING
INSTRUCTIONS.

158
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,167
- HIS HONOR.
- <i>OH, YEAH.</i>

159
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:06,100
HOLD FAST
YOUR VALUABLES.

160
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,501
HEY, AL.
ANY REASON I CAN'T
SHARE WITH DAN

161
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:12,434
THE PROCEEDINGS
OF THE TALK ME AND YOU
JUST HAD ABOUT ME

162
00:11:12,434 --> 00:11:14,467
TAKING OVER FOR
PERSIMMON PHIL?

163
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:16,400
YEAH, KEEP DAN
IN THE DARK.

164
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:20,434
 <i>HAVE A SEAT,</i>
 <i>YOUR HONOR.</i>

165
00:11:22,434 --> 00:11:24,033
- HEY, JOHNNY.
- DAN.

166
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:26,801
WHAT'S NEW?

167
00:11:26,801 --> 00:11:29,701
I WANT TO KNOW
HOW THE CAMP STANDS
WITH THE LEGISLATURE.

168
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:31,467
AND DON'T GIVE ME
THIS, UM,

169
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:35,067
- "ON THE ONE HAND
AND ON THE OTHER HAND."
- ALL RIGHT.

170
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:37,400
JUST SAY,
"THIS IS THE WAY
I THINK IT'S GONNA BE,"

171
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,100
'CAUSE THIS SEVERAL-
HANDS FUCKING SHIT DON'T
HELP ME.

172
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,434
- I'LL BOIL THINGS DOWN.
- GO AHEAD.

173
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:47,167
LET'S ASSUME FOR THE SAKE
OF CONVERSATION

174
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:49,534
THAT THERE'S A NEW TREATY
WITH THE SIOUX PEOPLES.

175
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:52,100
"PEOPLE," THAT'S
WHAT WE'RE CALLING
THOSE COCKSUCKERS NOW?

176
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,701
THAT'S THE WAY
THINGS ARE HEADED?

177
00:11:53,701 --> 00:11:57,868
ASSUMING THE NEW TREATY,
THE HILLS WILL BE ANNEXED.

178
00:11:57,868 --> 00:12:01,834
THE TERRITORY
RESPECTS THE STATUTES
OF THE NORTHWEST ORDINANCE,

179
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:06,701
WHICH STATE THAT A CITIZEN
CAN HAVE TITLE TO ANY LAND

180
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:10,501
UNCLAIMED
OR UNINCORPORATED
BY SIMPLE USAGE.

181
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:12,834
ESSENTIALLY,
IF YOU'RE ON IT

182
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:16,133
AND YOU IMPROVE IT,
YOU OWN IT.

183
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:20,567
BUT, WHAT COMPLICATES
THE SITUATION 

184
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:22,601
IS THAT THE HILLS
WERE DEEDED TO THE SIOUX

185
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:24,834
BY THE 1868
FORT LARAMIE TREATY.

186
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:28,834
THIS COULD MEAN
THAT THE LAND OCCUPIED
BY THE CAMP

187
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:32,534
DOESN'T FALL UNDER ANY
STATUTORY DEFINITION

188
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:34,434
OF UNCLAIMED
OR UNINCORPORATED.

189
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:36,434
SO WHO NEEDS
TO GET PAID?

190
00:12:36,434 --> 00:12:40,801
SIGNS OF CONCILIATION
AND WILLINGNESS WOULD WEIGH
IN THE CAMP'S FAVOR.

191
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,167
BUT JUST AS IMPORTANT
IS THE PRESENCE

192
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:46,567
OF A AD HOC
MUNICIPAL ORGANIZATION

193
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:49,400
THAT WOULD ENABLE
THE LEGISLATURE TO SAY

194
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,868
DEADWOOD EXISTS,
WE DON'T HAVE TO CREATE IT.

195
00:12:51,868 --> 00:12:54,167
IT WOULD BE DISRUPTIVE
IF WE DID.

196
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:55,834
THE COMMUNITY'S
ALREADY ORGANIZED,

197
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:59,067
NOT LEGALLY MAYBE,
BUT CERTAINLY INFORMALLY.

198
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:02,634
WHY NOT LET'S GIVE THIS
INFORMAL ORGANIZATION

199
00:13:02,634 --> 00:13:05,567
THE BLESSING
OF LEGAL STANDING?

200
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:08,634
WHAT'S THE RIGHT FUCKING
NUMBER FOR THE LEGISLATURE?

201
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:11,400
THERE'S A LOT OF GOLD
OUT HERE, AL.

202
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,033
TO DEFINE "RIGHT"
IN THIS ENVIRONMENT

203
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:17,634
IS VERY LIABLE TO BE
AN ONGOING PROCESS.

204
00:13:17,634 --> 00:13:19,801
WHAT I'M PREPARED TO DO
IS MAKE A LIST OF NAMES

205
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:22,767
AND A PRELIMINARY GUESS
AT SOME NUMBERS.

206
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,434
I SHOULD TELL YOU
AS WELL THAT A WARRANT'S
REACHED YANKTON

207
00:13:33,434 --> 00:13:36,100
CHARGING YOU WITH MURDER
IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.

208
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,767
AS THE SETTLEMENT'S
STATUS CHANGES, YOU WANT
TO ADDRESS THAT.

209
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:41,767
I COULD HELP
WITH THAT TOO.

210
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:44,601
HOW MUCH IS THAT
GONNA COST ME?

211
00:13:44,601 --> 00:13:47,801
$5,000.

212
00:13:51,234 --> 00:13:53,200
IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'LL CONTINUE WRITING.

213
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:13,834
GOOD MORNING,
MISS JANE.

214
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:16,834
YEAH, HELLO.

215
00:14:16,834 --> 00:14:18,834
NO ONE
CROAKED TODAY.

216
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:22,834
TOMMY'S STILL FUCKING
SICK AND THE DOC
WILL BE BACK

217
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:26,734
I GUESS WHENEVER
HE FUCKING FEELS
LIKE IT.

218
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:29,834
SEE YOUR FUCKING EYES
ARE STILL PLAYIN'
TUG O' WAR.

219
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:33,567
WELL, THIS IS THE ONE
TO LOOK AT.

220
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:38,434
LEFT ARM STILL USEFUL
AS AN OLD MAN'S DICK?

221
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:42,501
DO I SMELL STRANGELY
TO YOU, MISS JANE?

222
00:14:42,501 --> 00:14:44,634
WHAT?

223
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,167
DO I HAVE A STRANGE
ODOR ABOUT ME?

224
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:50,667
WHAT IS THAT, YOUR CLEVER
WAY OF SAYING YOU SMELL
WHISKEY ON MY BREATH?

225
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,701
NO.

226
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:55,033
IF EITHER OF YOUR FUCKING
EYES TAKES ME FOR HIDING

227
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:57,767
I'M DRINKING AGAIN
OCCASIONALLY, IT'S SADLY
MISTAKEN,

228
00:14:57,767 --> 00:15:02,234
SO DESIST FROM ANY CLEVER
ODOR REFERENCES.

229
00:15:05,501 --> 00:15:08,801
I THOUGHT THE SMELL MIGHT
BE COMING OFF THE CREEK

230
00:15:08,801 --> 00:15:11,801
SO I WENT INTO THE HILLS
LAST NIGHT BUT IT FOLLOWED
ME THERE TOO,

231
00:15:11,801 --> 00:15:16,667
AS IF MY, UH, AS IF
MY FLESH WERE ROTTING.

232
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:20,300
I, UH-- DO I LOOK
LIKE A MAN TAKEN FROM
HIS OWN GRAVE?

233
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,400
GOD DAMN YOU, PREACHER,
DON'T START TALKING CRAZY
TO GO WITH EVERYTHING ELSE.

234
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,834
ALSO, WHEN I READ THE--
THE SCRIPTURES,

235
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:29,334
I DO NOT FEEL CHRIST'S
LOVE AS I USED TO.

236
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:31,801
OH, IS THAT SO?

237
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:33,734
THAT IS TOO BAD.

238
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:36,534
JOIN THE FUCKING CLUB
OF MOST OF US.

239
00:15:36,534 --> 00:15:38,834
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, PREACHER.

240
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:41,834
I SEE YOU SKULKING AROUND
WHEN THE DOC COMES IN.

241
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:43,834
YOU'RE TRYING TO HIDE
YOUR FUCKING EYES,

242
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:45,567
TRYING TO HIDE
YOUR FUCKING ARM.

243
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:47,501
YOU'RE A FUCKING MESS.

244
00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:51,667
AND I AM IN THE PROCESS
OF WEARING OUT MY OWN FUCKING
WELCOME IN THIS CAMP.

245
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:54,367
AND I WOULDN'T EXPECT TO BE
AROUND HERE MUCH LONGER

246
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,868
FOR PEOPLE TO BE
DISGUSTED BY

247
00:15:56,868 --> 00:16:00,067
SO THEY DON'T NOTICE
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON
WITH YOU!

248
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:02,801
AND YOU NEED TO THINK
ABOUT SOME OF THESE THINGS

249
00:16:02,801 --> 00:16:06,434
AND RAISE YOUR NERVE
TO CONSULT WITH THE DOC!

250
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:24,734
GOD DAMN YOU!
SPILLING MY CLEANING
WATER TOO, MINISTER!

251
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:29,601
UP.

252
00:16:33,734 --> 00:16:35,701
THANK YOU,
I'M FINE.

253
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:37,801
YOU'RE FINE.

254
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:41,067
I AM OFF DUTY.
YOU'RE ON DUTY.

255
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,567
YOU CAN GO
FUCK YOURSELF!

256
00:17:08,534 --> 00:17:10,400
 <i>AL, WHAT ARE YOU</i>
 <i>DOING OUT?</i>

257
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,801
CLEARING MY HEAD.
AND IF I BLINK
WHEN I SPEAK,

258
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:14,767
THAT'S BECAUSE I JUST
GOT FUCKING FLEECED.

259
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,667
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- BE AT MY JOINT
IN TWO HOURS.

260
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:21,367
- WE'RE FORMING
A FUCKING GOVERNMENT.
- YES, SIR.

261
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:33,601
- ( glass shatters )
- MERRICK!

262
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:36,801
JESUS CHRIST.

263
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:38,801
HEY, MERRICK!

264
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:40,734
COCKSUCKER.

265
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:48,567
SHOOT.

266
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,367
THANK YOU, SIR.

267
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:01,400
GOOD LUCK OUT THERE.

268
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:06,133
I BELIEVE IT'S TIME
TO SEND FOR MY WIFE AND BOY.

269
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,100
TREATY COMING
WITH THE SIOUX.

270
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,567
WHERE THE FUCK
IS MERRICK, HUH?!

271
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:15,100
WE DON'T KNOW.

272
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,601
WELL ANYWAYS,
THIS IS IT.

273
00:18:16,601 --> 00:18:18,801
WHAT WE SPOKE ABOUT BEFORE,
THIS PUTS IT TO THE TEST.

274
00:18:18,801 --> 00:18:20,534
ALL RIGHT.

275
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:23,667
INFORMAL
MUNICIPAL ORGANIZATION.
NOT GOVERNMENT.

276
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,467
NO, THAT WOULD
MARK US REBELLIOUS.

277
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:29,234
BUT STRUCTURE ENOUGH TO
PERSUADE THOSE TERRITORIAL
COCKSUCKERS IN YANKTON

278
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:32,701
THAT WE'RE WORTHY
ENOUGH TO PAY THEM
THEIR FUCKING BRIBES.

279
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:35,634
WE'RE TO MEET TO DISCUSS
PUTTING THIS ORGANIZATION
TOGETHER.

280
00:18:35,634 --> 00:18:38,100
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING?

281
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,100
CENTURIES OF FUCKING
INBREEDING

282
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,067
ATTUNE HIM
TO THE NECESSITIES
OF THE TIMES.

283
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:46,734
- ( chuckling )
- TWO HOURS, MY PLACE!

284
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:55,033
DID A FUCKING
GOOD JOB HERE.

285
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:09,267
YOUR ROOM'S
PUT BACK TOGETHER.

286
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:11,200
THAT AIN'T
MY ROOM ANYMORE.

287
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:16,801
CY NEEDN'T HAVE DONE
FOR THEM KIDS THAT WAY.

288
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:18,801
NOT IN YOUR ROOM,

289
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:20,434
NOT IN THE WAY
HE DID FOR THEM.

290
00:19:20,434 --> 00:19:22,400
I'M GETTING
OUTTA HERE, EDDIE.

291
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,334
ARE YA?

292
00:19:25,634 --> 00:19:28,400
I'M GOING TO OPEN
MY OWN PLACE.

293
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,434
GOOD FOR YOU, HONEY.
HAVE YOU SAVED MONEY?

294
00:19:31,434 --> 00:19:33,767
I GOT A WAY
TO WORK IT.

295
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:36,734
I KNOW YOU'LL GET
A LONG WAY AWAY FROM
HERE FIRST.

296
00:19:36,734 --> 00:19:38,701
YOU THINK I HAVE TO?

297
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:45,133
CY TOLD ME HE'D HELP ME
OPEN A PLACE HERE.

298
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:47,701
HE PROMISED HE'D
KEEP HIS DISTANCE.

299
00:19:47,701 --> 00:19:49,200
GOOD.

300
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,367
- IS HE AROUND?
- ASLEEP.

301
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:53,767
THERE'S A MEETING
IN MY PLACE 

302
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:55,767
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS
HE'LL WANT TO BE AWAKE FOR.

303
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:58,501
ALL THE PILLARS
OF THE FUCKING CAMP.
YOU MIND?

304
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:00,767
YOU COULD USE
SOME REST.

305
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,634
I COULD USE
A CLEAN CONSCIENCE.

306
00:20:03,634 --> 00:20:05,701
SO COULD WE ALL.

307
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,133
BLAH!
( spitting )

308
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:15,400
WHERE THE FUCK
HAVE YOU BEEN?!

309
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,067
- AS YOU SEE.
- AS I SEE, WHAT?

310
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:22,567
AT MY STORAGE CABINET,
REPLENTISHING NEEDED SUPPLIES.

311
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:26,367
BE OVER IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.
WE GOTTA FORM A GOVERNMENT
FOR THE SETTLEMENT.

312
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:27,534
WHO DOES?

313
00:20:27,534 --> 00:20:29,667
US! YOU AND ME.

314
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:32,667
COME TO ME
IN A VISION!
YOU STUPID BASTARD.

315
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:45,300
ANYWAYS, I'M GOING
TO LOOK FOR A PLACE.

316
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,667
EDDIE.

317
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:02,400
SWEARENGEN'S
CALLED A MEETING.
TWO HOURS.

318
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,133
WHERE'S JOANIE?

319
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:09,033
OUT LOOKING FOR A PLACE.

320
00:21:10,634 --> 00:21:12,601
GOOD.

321
00:21:12,601 --> 00:21:15,334
'CAUSE I TOLD JOANIE
I'D BACK HER IN HAVING
HER OWN JOINT.

322
00:21:15,334 --> 00:21:16,734
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.

323
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,901
SOMETHING ON
YOUR MIND, EDDIE?

324
00:21:18,901 --> 00:21:21,267
YOU FUCKED ME UP, CY.

325
00:21:21,267 --> 00:21:23,434
THE SHIT YOU DID
TO THOSE KIDS,

326
00:21:23,434 --> 00:21:25,133
THERE'S NO ANGLE TO IT.

327
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:28,434
THAT SHIT WASN'T JUST
ABOUT THOSE KIDS, EDDIE.

328
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:31,901
YOU NEED TO SIT
THERE AND TOUGH YOUR WAY
THROUGH YOUR PROBLEM.

329
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:33,634
JUST KEEP
SHUFFLING YOUR CARDS

330
00:21:33,634 --> 00:21:36,067
AND LET YOUR TIE HANG DOWN
TILL YOU FEEL BETTER.

331
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:40,300
I WANT TO COME
TO THAT MEETING.

332
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:44,434
DO YA?

333
00:21:44,434 --> 00:21:46,701
COME AHEAD, EDDIE.

334
00:21:46,701 --> 00:21:48,701
PUT THE CARDS DOWN,
TIGHTEN YOUR CRAVAT

335
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:51,267
AND COME ON IF IT'LL
CHEER YOU THE FUCK UP.

336
00:21:51,267 --> 00:21:53,200
( chuckles )

337
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:57,667
( chatter )

338
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:11,434
( squealing )

339
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:37,634
( chatter intensifies )

340
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,734
MORNIN'.

341
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:07,968
GOOD MORNING.

342
00:23:07,968 --> 00:23:10,100
I'M OPENING
THIS BUSINESS.

343
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:14,400
WELL, GOOD LUCK.

344
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
THANK YOU.

345
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,200
I'M CHARLIE UTTER.

346
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,701
I'M JOANIE STUBBS.

347
00:23:20,701 --> 00:23:24,534
- HOW DO YOU DO?
- HOW DO YOU DO, CHARLIE?

348
00:23:24,534 --> 00:23:29,133
OOH, I WAS OUT OF BREATH,
BUT NOW I'M BETTER.

349
00:23:29,133 --> 00:23:31,400
ARE YOU OFF SOMEPLACE?

350
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,133
UH, YOU NEED AN ESCORT
OR THE LIKE?

351
00:23:33,133 --> 00:23:37,467
NO, I'M MORE OR LESS
JUST WALKING AROUND.

352
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:42,200
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS FROCK-COAT?

353
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:49,767
VERY WELL FITTED.

354
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:52,834
I HAD IT MADE
UP IN CHEYENNE.

355
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:55,267
I'M ONE FOR A GOOD
APPEARANCE AND ALL,

356
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,834
BUT IT'S A LITTLE
OUT OF MY PATH.

357
00:23:58,834 --> 00:24:00,901
IF YOU WOULD HAVE
MADE ME GUESS,

358
00:24:00,901 --> 00:24:03,167
I WOULD HAVE SAID
IT'S NOT YOUR
USUAL GARB.

359
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:06,400
AND I'M A CONSIDERABLE HAND
AT THE FREIGHT BUSINESS,

360
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,667
BUT FAR AS LEASING
THIS BUILDING

361
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:13,767
BEFORE KNOWING WHAT
THE TRAFFIC'S GONNA BEAR,

362
00:24:13,767 --> 00:24:17,400
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT POSSESSED ME.

363
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,667
SEE, I--
I DO WELL IN A CAMP

364
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,567
OR A SETTLEMENT
OR A TOWNSHIP,

365
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:26,868
 <i>BUT THAT DON'T</i>
 <i>MAKE ME A CAMP</i>

366
00:24:26,868 --> 00:24:29,601
OR A SETTLEMENT 
OR A TOWNSHIP TYPE.

367
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,701
THIS IS THE ATTIRE
FOR THAT TYPE OF TYPE.

368
00:24:36,701 --> 00:24:39,968
ANYWAY, YOU'RE 
WEARING IT TODAY.

369
00:24:39,968 --> 00:24:41,968
YOU'RE RIGHT.

370
00:24:41,968 --> 00:24:43,767
I'M SORRY FOR RUNNING
ON ABOUT IT.

371
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:46,667
I'M LOOKING FOR A PIECE
OF PROPERTY

372
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,667
TO START A BUSINESS ON.

373
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,000
THAT'S WHAT
I'M DOING OUT.

374
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,434
I SEE.

375
00:24:52,434 --> 00:24:55,100
AND WHAT SORT OF BUSINESS
YOU LOOKING TO OPERATE?

376
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,133
- BROTHEL.
- <i>UH-HUH.</i>

377
00:24:58,133 --> 00:25:01,067
WELL, UH,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
THIS CAMP HERE, 

378
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:03,100
IT SEEMS LIKE
IT'S GOT SOME LEGS
UNDER IT.

379
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,167
I'M JUST A WHORE,
THOUGH.

380
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,267
I MEAN, I RUN THE WHORES
FOR THIS MAN,

381
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:13,234
BUT FAR AS BEING
READY TO RUN A PLACE

382
00:25:13,234 --> 00:25:16,467
AND STAND UP TO ALL
YOU HAVE TO STAND UP TO,

383
00:25:16,467 --> 00:25:18,067
I-- I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT GOT INTO ME.

384
00:25:18,067 --> 00:25:21,100
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,

385
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,067
SOMETHING'S READY 
FOR YOU TO DO SOMETHING,

386
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:28,701
DON'T SEEM TO MATTER
IF YOU'RE READY OR NOT.

387
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:31,667
BETTER LIFT 
YOUR SKIRTS AND...

388
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:34,467
JUMP, HUH?

389
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:38,934
THAT'S WHAT'S COMING
TO ME TO BE TRUE.

390
00:25:38,934 --> 00:25:41,667
I'M SURPRISED YOU'RE NOT
AT THAT BIG TOWN MEETING.

391
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:45,601
UH, YEAH, WELL,
I'M, UH--

392
00:25:45,601 --> 00:25:48,300
I'M HEADING
OVER THERE SHORTLY.

393
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:53,868
UH, I PREFER
TO APPEAR LATE 
TO THAT TYPE OF THING.

394
00:25:53,868 --> 00:25:57,100
BELLA UNION,
WHERE I WORK,
IS BIGGER

395
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,434
BUT I GUESS BEING THAT
IT'S MR. SWEARENGEN'S
MEETING,

396
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:02,234
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE
HAVING IT AT THE GEM.

397
00:26:02,234 --> 00:26:06,801
YEAH, THAT'S-- THAT'S
WHY IT'S LOCATED THERE.

398
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:09,534
YEAH.

399
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:12,667
IT'S AWFUL NICE
TO MEET YOU, CHARLIE.

400
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:16,634
WELL IT'S GOOD
TO MEET YOU, TOO, JOANIE.

401
00:26:19,067 --> 00:26:21,567
TAKE CARE.

402
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:42,067
I'M GOING TO THE GEM.

403
00:26:53,434 --> 00:26:55,701
I'M HEADING ON.

404
00:27:11,968 --> 00:27:14,968
I'M HEADING
FOR THE GEM.

405
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:17,300
HOORAY FOR YOU.

406
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,534
REVEREND IS LAID DOWN
TRYING TO HIDE ANOTHER
SEIZURE.

407
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:25,033
AIN'T YOU CLEVER TO SEE
THROUGH THE SUBTERFUGE.

408
00:27:27,067 --> 00:27:30,000
I BEEN LETTING IT GO, 

409
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
BUT IF THE IDEA IS FOR YOU
TO DRINK MORE AND MORE
TILL I SAY SOMETHING,

410
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,467
I AM HEREBY
OFFICIALLY SAYING

411
00:27:36,467 --> 00:27:40,067
I WISH YOU WOULD
STOP FUCKING DRINKING.

412
00:27:40,067 --> 00:27:44,400
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA

413
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,067
AS FAR AS YOU SAYING
ONE FUCKING THING 

414
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:49,901
ABOUT ANYTHING
I DO OR DON'T,

415
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,334
FAR AS DRINKING

416
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:54,868
OR WHERE I STAND
OR NAP

417
00:27:54,868 --> 00:27:57,968
- OR ANY OTHER FUCKING
THING CONCERNING ME.
- I SEE.

418
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:01,868
OR GO OR LEAVE
OR DON'T OR WHEN.

419
00:28:01,868 --> 00:28:03,734
ALL RIGHT, JANE.

420
00:28:03,734 --> 00:28:05,567
SO YOU CAN GO
FUCK YOURSELF.

421
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:09,067
AND DON'T TRY
AND HASTEN ANYONE
ANYWHERE,

422
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:11,634
'CAUSE EVERYONE FOLLOWS
THEIR OWN FUCKING PACE,

423
00:28:11,634 --> 00:28:14,701
AND DON'T TRY
AND FUCKING HASTEN THEM.

424
00:28:14,701 --> 00:28:18,601
AND YOU HAPPEN TO BE
FUCKING OVERLOOKING

425
00:28:18,601 --> 00:28:22,601
THAT YOU THINK IT'S JUST
ONE DAY AFTER ANOTHER 

426
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:25,200
WITH THE SAME
FUCKING SEIZURE

427
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,634
AS IF IT HAPPENED
THE WEEK BEFORE.

428
00:28:27,634 --> 00:28:30,934
 <i>AND THAT JUST SHOWS</i>
 <i>HOW MUCH YOU FUCKING KNOW </i>

00:28:34,267 --> 00:28:38,367
( grunts)
GOD DAMN YOU!

431
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,834
WHAT DO THEY PAY YOU
TO HOLD THAT BUILDING UP?

432
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:01,000

OF "UTTER CHARLIE 
AND FREIGHT."

434
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:08,567
IT'S ENOUGH TO GET YOU
OFF WITH A POSITION.

435
00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:10,501
I'M IN A POSITION,

436

YEAH, LEANING FORWARD,
SHIT-FACED DRUNK.

438
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:23,434
I AM TALKING ABOUT
NURSING THE PLAGUE.

439
00:29:23,434 --> 00:29:26,467
FUCKING TENT OPERATION.

440

CARING OF THE SICK

00:39:01,334 --> 00:39:03,601
VERY.

601
00:39:07,868 --> 00:39:10,300
- TAKE SOME AIR.
- YES, SIR.

602
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,434
- EVENIN'.

603
00:39:14,434 --> 00:39:15,567
SOME MEETING, HUH?

604
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:18,467
CONGRATULATIONS 
ON YOUR NEW POST.

605
00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:19,601
OH.

606
00:39:19,601 --> 00:39:21,501
AND FOR YOUR
FREIGHT BUSINESS.

607
00:39:21,501 --> 00:39:24,734
- THANK YOU.
- OKAY.

608
00:39:24,734 --> 00:39:26,968
EVENING, CHARLIE.

609
00:39:26,968 --> 00:39:29,267
EVENING.

610
00:39:34,367 --> 00:39:36,367
( sighing )
HOW MUCH TIME
YOU THINK THAT

611
00:39:36,367 --> 00:39:40,067
FIRE MARSHAL OBLIGATION'S
GONNA TAKE?

612
00:39:41,467 --> 00:39:45,067
MORE OR LESS
AS MUCH AS YOUR HEALTH
COMMISSIONER, HUH?

613
00:39:46,901 --> 00:39:49,400
HOW ABOUT THAT DOC?

614
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,133
GRAVE ROBBER.

615
00:39:54,868 --> 00:39:58,167
ANYBODY ELSE FELLED
FROM THEM CANNED PEACHES?

616
00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:00,400
NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE.
WHY, YOU FEELING POORLY?

617
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,934
WELL, UM, IT'S--
IT'S EASING UP SOME.

618
00:40:20,067 --> 00:40:22,834
- EVENING.
- EVENING.

619
00:40:22,834 --> 00:40:25,400
I'VE WONDERED HOW
THINGS WERE WITH YOU...

620
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,367
 <i>AND MRS. GARRET</i>
 <i>AND THE CHILD.</i>

621
00:40:30,634 --> 00:40:33,000
I EXPECT 
THEY'RE WELL.

622
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,467
 <i>I KNOW SHE STRUCK</i>
 <i>LUCKY AT HER CLAIM.</i>

623
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:36,834
AND HOW ARE YOU, TRIXIE?

624
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:39,000
AS YOU SEE.

625
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,534
EARNING THE GREASY EYE
FROM MY BOSS FOR
IDLE CHATTER.

626
00:40:42,534 --> 00:40:44,267
CAN I BUY
YOU A DRINK?

627
00:40:44,267 --> 00:40:46,434
I'D RATHER
YOU DIDN'T.

628
00:40:49,234 --> 00:40:51,000
THIS ISN'T
THE PLACE FOR YOU.

629
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,734
SO YOU SAY.

630
00:40:52,734 --> 00:40:55,534
IF YOU INSIST ON
MY EMBARRASSING MYSELF,

631
00:40:55,534 --> 00:40:57,734
HAVE IT NOT WHERE
I'D WANT YOU TO SEE ME.

632
00:40:57,734 --> 00:40:59,767
COME SEE ME THEN.

633
00:40:59,767 --> 00:41:02,100
HE DON'T PERMIT
OUR MAKING CALLS OUT.

634
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,801
COME TO OUR STORE.
COME BUY A BROOM.

635
00:41:06,501 --> 00:41:09,067
I DON'T WANT WHAT
I CAN'T HAVE, MR. STAR.

636
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:11,501
ALL RIGHT.

637
00:41:12,801 --> 00:41:15,033
IF I DID COME, 

638
00:41:15,033 --> 00:41:17,334
I'D BUY AN AXE,
A HAMMER AND A SAW.

639
00:41:17,334 --> 00:41:20,367
ALL FULLY STOCKED.

640
00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:24,100
AND WE NEVER ASK THE PURPOSE
OF A CUSTOMER'S PURCHASE.

641
00:41:38,601 --> 00:41:41,434
OUR MAYOR.

642
00:41:46,167 --> 00:41:48,634
OH, MAYOR!

643
00:42:09,033 --> 00:42:11,067
DOCTOR.

644
00:42:11,067 --> 00:42:13,000
I'M GONNA HAVE
A LOOK AT YOU.

645
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,167
ALL RIGHT.

646
00:42:19,767 --> 00:42:21,968
DON'T TURN YOUR
HEAD AWAY, REVEREND.

647
00:42:21,968 --> 00:42:25,467
BEING SICK AIN'T NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

648
00:42:25,467 --> 00:42:27,901
LOOK AT MY FINGER.

649
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:37,400
I APOLOGIZE
FOR THE SMELL.

650
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,300
WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU SMELL?

651
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,234
AS IF I'VE DIED.

652
00:42:42,234 --> 00:42:45,901
YOU EMIT NO SUCH ODOR.

653
00:42:45,901 --> 00:42:48,868
I SMELL
MY FLESH ROTTING.

654
00:42:48,868 --> 00:42:50,868
IT ISN'T ROTTING,
REVEREND.

655
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:53,634
YOUR FLESH
DOES NOT SMELL.

656
00:42:53,634 --> 00:42:56,133
YOU'VE NOT DIED.

657
00:42:56,133 --> 00:42:59,834
YOU'RE HAVING ORGANIC
CHANGES IN YOUR MIND 

658
00:42:59,834 --> 00:43:02,801
THAT'S MAKING YOU
BELIEVE THESE THINGS.

659
00:43:02,801 --> 00:43:05,968
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

660
00:43:08,067 --> 00:43:10,634
FORMERLY, DOCTOR,

661
00:43:10,634 --> 00:43:14,200
WHEN THE WORD TOOK ME
AS I READ SCRIPTURE,

662
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,100
PEOPLE FELT GOD'S
PRESENCE THROUGH ME 

663
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:21,834
AND THAT WAS A GREAT GIFT
THAT I COULD GIVE TO THEM.

664
00:43:21,834 --> 00:43:26,200
NOW THE WORD DOES NOT
TAKE ME WHEN I READ.

665
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,834
NOR DO I FEEL 
CHRIST'S LOVE.

666
00:43:29,834 --> 00:43:33,033
NOR DO THOSE WHO LISTEN
HEAR IT THROUGH ME.

667
00:43:33,033 --> 00:43:35,567
ALL RIGHT.

668
00:43:35,567 --> 00:43:38,834
THIS IS GOD'S PURPOSE.

669
00:43:38,834 --> 00:43:42,300
THE NOT KNOWING
THE PURPOSE IS...

670
00:43:43,968 --> 00:43:46,634
MY PORTION
OF SUFFERING.

671
00:43:46,634 --> 00:43:50,400
AND IS THERE ANY PAIN

672
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,367
COMPETING WITH
THE NOT KNOWING?

673
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:57,634
I'M NOT IN PAIN.

674
00:43:57,634 --> 00:44:01,167
THERE ARE NEW SMELLS
I SMELL.

675
00:44:01,167 --> 00:44:04,367
AND THERE PARTS OF MY
BODY I CAN'T FEEL,

676
00:44:04,367 --> 00:44:06,033
AND HIS--

677
00:44:06,033 --> 00:44:07,934
AND HIS LOVE.

678
00:44:07,934 --> 00:44:12,567
AND YOU WANT
TO CONTINUE LIKE THIS?

679
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:20,901
AS LONG AS HE WILLS,
THIS MUST BE MY PART.

680
00:44:20,901 --> 00:44:24,934
TO BE AFRAID, AS WELL.

681
00:44:24,934 --> 00:44:27,968
WELL IF THIS IS HIS
WILL, REVEREND, 

682
00:44:27,968 --> 00:44:31,901
HE IS A SON OF A BITCH.

683
00:44:37,334 --> 00:44:39,968
GOOD NIGHT.

684
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,601
GOOD NIGHT, DOCTOR.

685
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:05,334
HEY, EDDIE.

686
00:45:05,334 --> 00:45:08,234
HEY, KID.
HOW'D IT GO?

687
00:45:08,234 --> 00:45:12,367
ALL RIGHT.
AND I GOT ME
A FOUR-BIT ROOM.

688
00:45:12,367 --> 00:45:15,400
PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT,
I'LL TELL YOU WHERE.

689
00:45:26,734 --> 00:45:29,634
Joanie:
 <i>HI, CY.</i>

690
00:45:29,634 --> 00:45:32,467
I WAS AFRAID I'D LOST
YOU TO THE HEATHENS.

691
00:45:32,467 --> 00:45:33,901
HOW WAS THAT MEETING?

692
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:37,133
 <i>ALL RIGHT.</i>
 <i>WE WERE ORGANIZING</i>
 <i>FOR ANNEXATION </i>

693
00:45:37,133 --> 00:45:40,400
UNTIL EDDIE CRACKED
HIS FUCKING MOUTH.

694
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,667
WHAT'D IT TURN TO THEN?

695
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:46,234
( laughing )

696
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:55,167
A JOINT LIKE OURS, JOANIE,
WHAT ARE WE SELLING?

697
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:57,467
WALK THROUGH THIS DOOR,

698
00:45:57,467 --> 00:45:59,234
IT'S A NEW START.

699
00:45:59,234 --> 00:46:01,434
COME ON IN,
TRY YOUR LUCK HERE.

700
00:46:01,434 --> 00:46:03,067
OF COURSE, WE KNOW 

701
00:46:03,067 --> 00:46:06,934
 <i>THE PERCENTAGES </i>
 <i>BEING THE PERCENTAGES,</i>
 <i>YOU PLAY LONG ENOUGH, </i>

702
00:46:06,934 --> 00:46:10,000
 <i>YOUR LUCK AIN'T GONNA GET</i>
 <i>NO BETTER HERE THAN</i>
 <i>ANYWHERES ELSE.</i>

703
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,901
MAYBE IT'S 'CAUSE 
WE'RE IN A BRAND NEW CAMP.

704
00:46:13,901 --> 00:46:15,868
SINCE WE ARRIVED, 

705
00:46:15,868 --> 00:46:18,367
CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT 
ARE NEAR AND DEAR TO ME

706
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,667
SEEM TO HAVE BOUGHT
INTO OUR OWN FUCKING LINE

707
00:46:20,667 --> 00:46:23,133
AND NOW THEY'RE TRYING
TO GET ME TO GO ALONG.

708
00:46:23,133 --> 00:46:25,534
BUT I CAN'T.

709
00:46:25,534 --> 00:46:29,701
SEE, JOANIE,
'CAUSE I'M A BIG BOY.

710
00:46:29,701 --> 00:46:32,801
NOW I'M READY FOR...

711
00:46:32,801 --> 00:46:35,334
EDDIE AND ME
TO HAVE A LITTLE CHAT.

712
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:38,300
 <i>I DID LOOK AROUND</i>
 <i>FOR PLACES, CY.</i>

713
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,667
GOOD, I WANTED YOU TO.

714
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:44,167
I WANT TO GO AHEAD
AND DO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

715
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:46,400
GOOD, HONEY.

716
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,400
WITH YOUR EYES
WIDE OPEN.

717
00:47:05,467 --> 00:47:07,234
EDDIE SAWYER.

718
00:47:07,234 --> 00:47:08,968
CAN WE KEEP 
THIS SHORT?

719
00:47:08,968 --> 00:47:11,400
 <i>SURE, EDDIE.</i>

720
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,300
IF HE FINDS YOU
A 12-YEAR-OLD FARMBOY
TO HAVE SOME FUN WITH,

721
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,400
IS THAT SHORT ENOUGH
FOR YOU?

722
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,267
I NEVER DID THAT
AND YOU KNOW IT.

723
00:47:20,267 --> 00:47:22,234
ALL THIS CRAP ABOUT
WHAT IS AND ISN'T NATURAL,

724
00:47:22,234 --> 00:47:24,834
WHATEVER DOES IT FOR
A FELLA IS WHAT DOES IT,
AIN'T THAT RIGHT?

725
00:47:24,834 --> 00:47:26,501
I NEVER DID THAT.

726
00:47:26,501 --> 00:47:30,400
BUT DID YOU EVER
WANT TO UNBUTTON SOME
FARMBOY'S DENTONS

727
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,601
AND GET YOURSELF
SOME RELAXATION?
THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING.

728
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:37,601
TAKE THAT BOY YOU SPOKE UP
FOR UP IN JOANIE'S ROOM
THE OTHER DAY.

729
00:47:39,267 --> 00:47:41,667
I SPOKE UP FOR NOT
TORTURING THAT BOY.

730
00:47:41,667 --> 00:47:44,467
WELL, WHAT YOU SPOKE FOR
AND WHAT YOU WOULD
HAVE WANTED TO DO

731
00:47:44,467 --> 00:47:47,534
IF IT WAS JUST YOU
AND THAT CORN-FED IN
THAT ROOM ALONE

732
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:50,434
IS WHAT I'M INQUIRING
ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN.

733
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:53,968
- A DRY HOLE, CY.
- AW, YOU COULD WORK
THAT OUT.

734
00:47:53,968 --> 00:47:56,467
YOU JUST USE SOME
SPIT ON THAT OR LARD.

735
00:47:59,934 --> 00:48:02,934
17 FUCKING YEARS
AND I NEVER SAW A LOOK
ON YOUR FACE

736
00:48:02,934 --> 00:48:05,033
LIKE I SAW UP THERE
IN THAT ROOM THE OTHER DAY.

737
00:48:05,033 --> 00:48:07,300
INCLUDING WHEN I HAD
TO SMACK SOME GIRL AROUND.

738
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,133
I WAS NEVER IN A ROOM
WITH YOU BEFORE

739
00:48:09,133 --> 00:48:11,200
WHERE YOU WAS 
GONNA KILL SOMEBODY.

740
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,067
I DO NOT MAKE JUDGMENTS.
I GAVE THAT UP A LONG
TIME AGO.

741
00:48:15,067 --> 00:48:17,234
ALL I WANT IS FOR US
TO GET ALONG BETTER, EDDIE.

742
00:48:17,234 --> 00:48:19,400
SO EVERY TIME YOU OPEN
YOUR MOUTH IN PUBLIC,

743
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,834
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT WHAT THE FUCK'S
GONNA COME OUT!

744
00:48:21,834 --> 00:48:23,868
SO LET ME GET YOU
SOME FUCKING KID

745
00:48:23,868 --> 00:48:26,467
TO FUCK IN THE ASS
OR MOUTH OR SUCK HIS PRICK
OR LET HIM FUCK YOU!

746
00:48:26,467 --> 00:48:28,901
FUCK YOU, CY.
FUCK YOU.

747
00:48:28,901 --> 00:48:31,567
NOW, NOW.
THAT'S WHERE I DRAW
THE LINE.

748
00:48:31,567 --> 00:48:34,167
FRIEND OR NO FRIEND,
AND US WANTING TO GET
ALONG BETTER OR NOT,

749
00:48:34,167 --> 00:48:37,234
I WANT YOU TO GO UP
INTO JOANIE'S ROOM,
WHICH I--

750
00:48:37,234 --> 00:48:40,067
 <i>I GATHER SHE DON'T</i>
 <i>WANT TO GO INTO NO MORE.</i>

751
00:48:40,067 --> 00:48:42,734
 <i>I WANT YOU TO GO</i>
 <i>UP THERE AND THINK</i>
 <i>THIS THING THROUGH.</i>

752
00:48:42,734 --> 00:48:45,067
IMAGINE YOURSELF UP
THERE WITH THAT BOY

753
00:48:45,067 --> 00:48:48,701
LIKE THE OTHER DAY,
ONLY THIS TIME IT'S JUST
HIM AND YOU.

754
00:48:48,701 --> 00:48:52,234
AND I WANT YOU TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT.

755
00:48:52,234 --> 00:48:54,467
'CAUSE NEXT TIME 
WE SEE EACH OTHER,

756
00:48:54,467 --> 00:48:57,367
I WANT YOU CLEARHEADED,
AND UNDERSTANDING
YOURSELF.

757
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:59,534
THE OLD EDDIE THAT
KNOWS THE PERCENTAGES 
AND HOW TO PLAY 'EM, 

758
00:48:59,534 --> 00:49:02,701
AND WHATEVER A MAN
DOES AWAY FROM THE TABLE
IS HIS OWN BUSINESS.

759
00:49:02,701 --> 00:49:05,868
I WANT YOU CHEERFUL
AND READY TO HELP ME
WITH MY WORK

760
00:49:05,868 --> 00:49:07,567
OR I DON'T WANT YOU
COMING THE FUCK OUT!

761
00:49:07,567 --> 00:49:09,934
 <i>HMM?</i>
 <i>YOU FINISH YOUR SHIFT</i>

762
00:49:09,934 --> 00:49:11,534
AND YOU GO UP THERE 
TO JOANIE'S ROOM

763
00:49:11,534 --> 00:49:13,300
 <i>AND YOU THINK </i>
 <i>THINGS THROUGH.</i>

764
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,901
ALL RIGHT, 
EDDIE SAWYER?!

765
00:49:16,901 --> 00:49:20,367
DO WE UNDERSTAND 
EACH OTHER?

766
00:49:20,367 --> 00:49:22,701
WHY DIDN'T YOU
VOLUNTEER FOR SOMETHING
AT THAT MEETING?

767
00:49:22,701 --> 00:49:24,467
WHY DIDN'T YOU 
PUT YOUR HAND UP?

768
00:49:24,467 --> 00:49:27,601
MIGHT'VE KEPT YOU
FROM BEING SUCH AN EVIL
COCKSUCKER.

769
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,300
 <i>( dog barking )</i>

770
00:49:50,968 --> 00:49:53,567
SAY HELLO TO THE NEW
FIRE MARSHAL.

771
00:49:57,234 --> 00:50:00,133
I'M GETTING OUT.

772
00:50:00,133 --> 00:50:03,234
GOODBYE
AND GOOD LUCK.

773
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:05,767
WAIT ON IT UNTIL
YOU AIN'T EXHAUSTED, JANE.

774
00:50:05,767 --> 00:50:07,501
MAYBE YOU'LL
CHANGE YOUR MIND.

775
00:50:07,501 --> 00:50:11,300
DIRECTION OF THIS
ENTIRE CAMP

776
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,133
MAKES ME SICK,

777
00:50:13,133 --> 00:50:16,767
AND IT BORES
THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF ME.

778
00:50:16,767 --> 00:50:19,334
WELL WORKING HOURS
LIKE YOU'VE BEEN WORKING

779
00:50:19,334 --> 00:50:21,634
WOULD GET ANYONE
OUT OF SORTS.

780
00:50:21,634 --> 00:50:25,033
AND YOU HELPED
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

781
00:50:25,033 --> 00:50:28,367
SENT A DOZEN MEN
OUT WITH THEIR PLAGUE
SORES HEALED

782
00:50:28,367 --> 00:50:30,968
TO GO BACK TO GETTING
'EM ON THEIR JOHNSONS.

783
00:50:30,968 --> 00:50:35,167
I WILL NOT BE A DRUNK
WHERE HE'S BURIED.

784
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:42,501
AND I CANNOT
STAY FUCKING SOBER.

785
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:45,467
SO YOU...

786
00:50:45,467 --> 00:50:49,400
AND EVERY HUMAN
BEING ON EARTH--

787
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,467
PAST, PRESENT
AND FUTURE

788
00:50:51,467 --> 00:50:53,601
CAN DRINK
MARE'S PISS.

789
00:50:53,601 --> 00:50:55,567
BELIEVE I'LL JUST
HAVE WELL WATER.

790
00:50:55,567 --> 00:50:57,901
- SHUT UP, CHARLIE.
- ALL RIGHT.

791
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:19,300
IF THE SUBJECT COMES UP,

792
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,701
EXPLAIN TO BILL.

793
00:51:24,634 --> 00:51:27,100

TELL THEM OVER AT LIVERY
I-- I'M GOOD FOR THE MOUNT.

796

DO NOT FUCKING
WORRY ABOUT ME.

797
00:51:41,968 --> 00:51:45,467
AND INFORM HOSTETLER
AT THE FUCKING LIVERY

798
00:51:45,467 --> 00:51:48,601
YOU SAVED HIS

799
00:51:48,601 --> 00:51:50,601
 <i>ALL RIGHT.</i>

800
00:51:50,601 --> 00:51:53,901
AND DO NOT WORRY ABOUT
GETTING PAID BACK.

801
00:51:53,901 --> 00:51:56,300
CHECK THE MAIL, 
CHARLIE,

802
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:59,367
AND YOU WILL FIND
SOON PROPER PAYMENT.

803
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:01,534
ALL RIGHT, JANE.

804
00:52:01,534 --> 00:52:05,067
CHECK WITH UTTER MAIL

 <i>ALL RIGHT.</i>

806
00:52:15,834 --> 00:52:20,133
SINCE LAST OUR EYES
WERE UPON EACH OTHER,
LO,

807
00:52:20,133 --> 00:52:24,300
I HOPE YOU'VE EARNED
ME $5.

808
00:52:31,167 --> 00:52:33,133
NO.

809
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:44,334
( clearing throat )
I-- I GAVE THE LADY
YOUR NOTE, SIR.

810
00:52:44,334 --> 00:52:47,534
SHE SAYS TO COME
AHEAD, BUT TO KNOCK LOW
AS THE LITTLE ONE'S ASLEEP.

811
00:52:47,534 --> 00:52:49,634
THANK YOU.

812
00:52:49,634 --> 00:52:53,334
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, SIR.

813

EVENING.

815
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,901
GOOD EVENING, MR. BULLOCK.
SOPHIA'S ASLEEP.

816
00:53:10,901 --> 00:53:13,367
SO I WAS TOLD.
SORRY FOR CALLING
SO LATE.

817
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:27,467
I'M TO SEE ELLSWORTH
IN THE MORNING AND WONDERED
WHAT I SHOULD SAY.

818
00:53:27,467 --> 00:53:30,234
ELLSWORTH SEEMED VERY
COMPETENT AND TRUSTWORTHY.

819
00:53:30,234 --> 00:53:32,667
HE SUGGESTED THAT
UNTIL THE EXTENT 

820
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:35,000
OF THE QUARTZ DEPOSITS
COULD BE PROVED, 

821
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,734
HE COULD PROSPECT THE CREEK
ON MY CLAIM EACH WEEK 

822
00:53:37,734 --> 00:53:39,067
TO KEEP MY TITLE ACTIVE.

823
00:53:39,067 --> 00:53:41,400
HOW'D THAT PLAN
SOUND TO YOU?

824
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,300
I FEEL IT'S EXACTLY
THE WAY TO PROCEED.

825
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,868
ALL RIGHT THEN.

826
00:53:47,567 --> 00:53:49,734
- WON'T YOU SIT DOWN?
- THANK YOU.

827
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,133
WOULD IT IMPROVE
YOUR OPINION OF ME

828
00:54:10,133 --> 00:54:12,868
IF I TOLD YOU
I WAS COMMISSIONER
OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH?

829
00:54:12,868 --> 00:54:17,067
HOW WONDERFUL.
I SUPPOSE.

830
00:54:17,067 --> 00:54:19,267
IT'S TO PUT THE CAMP'S
BEST FOOT FORWARD 

831
00:54:19,267 --> 00:54:21,267
AS FAR AS BEING TAKEN
INTO THE TERRITORY.

832
00:54:21,267 --> 00:54:23,300
A NUMBER OF MEN 
TOOK POSITIONS.

833
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,501
- I SEE.
- FARNUM'S MAYOR.

834
00:54:25,501 --> 00:54:28,167
HOW HORRIFYING.

835
00:54:30,868 --> 00:54:34,133
I WROTE
TO MY WIFE TODAY.

836
00:54:34,133 --> 00:54:36,167
DID YOU?

837
00:54:36,167 --> 00:54:38,868
ABOUT HER AND MY BOY
COMING TO THE CAMP.

838
00:54:38,868 --> 00:54:40,868
YOU HAVE A SON AS WELL?

839
00:54:40,868 --> 00:54:43,267
THEY'RE IN MICHIGAN
WITH HER PEOPLE.

840
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,400
MY THINKING WAS

841
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,901
WITH THE TREATY COMING,
ANNEXATION,

842
00:54:50,901 --> 00:54:53,334
THE CAMP WOULD
BE SETTLING DOWN,
A SAFER PLACE.

843
00:54:53,334 --> 00:54:55,934
YES.

844
00:55:01,367 --> 00:55:05,100
- ANY OTHER SONS
OR DAUGHTERS? 
- NO, THAT'S IT.

845
00:55:11,167 --> 00:55:13,267
MY BROTHER WAS
IN THE CAVALRY.

846
00:55:13,267 --> 00:55:16,234
HE WAS KILLED
TWO YEARS AGO.

847
00:55:16,234 --> 00:55:18,467
I'M SORRY.

848
00:55:21,267 --> 00:55:23,400
ANYWAYS.

849
00:55:28,467 --> 00:55:31,567
I'M GLAD YOU GOT
ALONG WITH ELLSWORTH.

850
00:55:31,567 --> 00:55:35,300
WELL, THANK YOU FOR ALL
YOUR HELP, MR. BULLOCK.

851
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,000
SURE.

852
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,834

REJOINING YOU.

854
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:44,968

GOOD NIGHT.

857
00:55:55,968 --> 00:56:00,434
MAY I ASK WHY YOU SPOKE
OF YOUR BROTHER?

858
00:56:00,434 --> 00:56:03,234
MY WIFE
WAS HIS WIDOW.

859
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:06,934
MY BOY
IS THEIR CHILD.

860
00:56:06,934 --> 00:56:10,267
I SEE.

861
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:13,534
