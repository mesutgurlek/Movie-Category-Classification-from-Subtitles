1
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:19,591
God will punish you, Jelly Roll.

2
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,926
You scared
the bejazus out of me.

3
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,330
Well, it ain't smart
to live alone, Tom.

4
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,900
You start seeing
scary shadows.

5
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,705
Red shadows.

6
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:37,842
God will fry
those savages in hell.

7
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:43,205
I see them now dragging beasts and
their belongs through the valley.

8
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:48,719
And I think,
"What a waste of the Promise Land!"

9
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,589
You see here?

10
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:59,390
These little flags are us.
And all this nothing is them.

11
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,227
Does it make sense to you?

12
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,164
It 's Indian territory.

13
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,272
Back in the olden days of
Spanish Conquest, every Friday...

14
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:13,343
I used to kill off 12 savages
in memory of the 12 holy apostles.

15
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:16,037
Those religious traditions
ought to be kept up.

16
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,274
There are hundreds
of frightening Christians...

17
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,748
ready and waiting
for this land to be opened up...

18
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:24,081
and willing to pay
good prices for it.

19
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,657
Not everybody is as good
a Christian as you are, Tom.

20
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,388
Nowadays, you've got to have
an excuse for killing Indians.

21
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,904
Like Major Cabot had,
when he found out the wells poisoned.

22
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,735
- Oh, yeah!
- We know, sure.

23
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:47,208
Someway, the Major
didn't put the poison himself.

24
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:54,475
But he found a lot of Indian beads
gathered around those wells.

25
00:05:56,122 --> 00:06:00,388
If what we need is an excuse, why
don't we cook one up for ourselves?

26
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,686
We get undressed like
those Pagan savages...

27
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:06,058
and get rid of some white trash
living by himself.

28
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:11,362
Fast up, Tom. You'd been
chewed fat with Major Cabot.

29
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,540
No, I ain't. Why?

30
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:18,472
You're saying exactly the same
of he's being saying.

31
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:23,012
That 's because him and me
are practical people.

32
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,549
- Pioneers the old frontier.
- No.

33
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:30,712
It 's because you both are made up
of the same clay.

34
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:34,256
You both got
the evil genius in you.

35
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,926
Good ol' Cabot!

36
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:51,537
Tell me, you fellows decided
yet who you're gonna scalp?

37
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:26,162
Tucumcaril!

38
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,439
Tucumcaril!

39
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:48,411
Hey, Frank!
Bring the ted a cup of coffee.

40
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,950
How funny!

41
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,360
Look it! Look! Look!

42
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,557
Stop it, man!
You are hurting the fleas!

43
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:14,204
Looked like a rooster dance,
didn't it? Like a rooster.

44
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:36,895
You're smart to grease that barrel,
if you want some good advise.

45
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:40,361
- Fall down the sight too.
- Why is that?

46
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:44,696
Why? 'Cause sooner or later,
strangers around here...

47
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:49,034
get their guns loaded up their...

48
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:57,407
- You don't want to get scratched.
- Thanks.

49
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:00,016
"Thanks"?
Thanks for what?

50
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,017
That 's my name.
Joe Thanks.

51
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:09,217
I'm impressed.
I really am.

52
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,692
I know you.

53
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:19,769
- Do you, now?
- Yeah. You're the village idiot.

54
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:23,499
There's somebody in every town
that gives me that kind of welcome.

55
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,776
You wouldn't talk like that
if I had a gun on me!

56
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:33,207
I'm looking for a man...

57
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,785
...who can shoot fast.
- How fast?

58
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,949
Well, let 's say,
not a man that shoots first...

59
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,755
but if somebody shoots at him,
he sure doesn't shoot second.

60
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:48,229
You sound like a hard
fellow to please.

61
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:53,102
But you might give
Duc Foster a try.

62
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,933
Duc, one of these days...

63
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,199
you're gonna have
to get up from this table...

64
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:34,209
and gonna out and see
what 's gonna on out there.

65
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,938
Not a thing gonna on there,
never will be.

66
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,709
This town is one
long Sunday afternoon.

67
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,686
Five.

68
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,863
Me too.

69
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,658
And here.

70
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:58,764
Pass.

71
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,476
Five dollars.

72
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,907
Pass.

73
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,611
Pass.

74
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,018
Ten dollars.

75
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:18,784
Careful, it 's very hot.

76
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,326
Pass.

77
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,198
Last time I saw my missis,
she was nine months heavy.

78
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:33,098
For all I know, I've got a family
to take care of by now.

79
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,273
Let me go home, Duc.

80
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:38,538
I'm waiting for somebody.

81
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:42,514
Looks like somebody
is already here.

82
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,624
You ain't somebody.

83
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,027
Nobody to all.

84
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:27,354
- Sorry, Duc.
- For what? Keep going.

85
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,958
No.

86
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,561
- The pack.
- Okay.

87
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,459
Yeah.

88
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,009
Two.

89
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:50,875
Three.

90
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,844
One.

91
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,319
- Pass.
- Same here.

92
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,495
- Ten, just to keep things going.
- Ten.

93
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,297
Cover with one hundred.

94
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:17,441
What happens in this game
when the fellow's got 4 cards alike?

95
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,481
What happens is... I'm out.

96
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,384
Same here.

97
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,548
Four aces,
all four in the same hand.

98
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,819
I never saw alike
in all my born days.

99
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,621
Not even when I cheated.

100
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:44,200
Give this a try, Duc.
Colt Navy, model 86.

101
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,849
All these nice folks are gathered
around. They want to see a duel.

102
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:36,613
What duel?

103
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,916
Well, you know how these things
work out here in the West.

104
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,058
Two fellows come out
of the saloon...

105
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,993
and stand opposite
to each other.

106
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,691
One of them usually
got his legs spread apart.

107
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:55,499
And the folks in the town get scared
and go to a save distance.

108
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,442
And somebody starts playing
a funeral march...

109
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,010
on the horn,
on the background.

110
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,378
And then nothing.

111
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:12,717
Not a sound. Only the
whistling wind from the desert.

112
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,996
Let me tell you the rest.

113
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:23,794
In a couple of minutes, you're gonna be
one of the deadest men that ever lived.

114
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,562
Outside, my time is precious.

115
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,605
I know, I know,
you are waiting for somebody.

116
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,669
Hey, come on, come on, everyone!
Hey, they're gonna shoot it out!

117
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,009
Duc Foster and the new guy!
Come on! Come on!

118
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:42,551
They're gonna shoot it out,
everyone! Let 's go!

119
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,823
When you're ready, Duc.

120
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,996
- Your horse, Duc?
- Come and stop acting like a booby.

121
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,313
Mighty pretty animal.

122
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,824
Don't play the clown.

123
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:05,503
Nobody takes care of you, huh?

124
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:11,268
- Poor creature was thirsty!
- Next shot 's for you.

125
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,839
Hear me?

126
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,948
Sorry, Duc. You shoot
when you feel like it, huh?

127
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,891
No, Duc.

128
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:05,261
Did you like the show?
Good. That makes me happy.

129
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:08,729
If you be so kind, folks, whatever
you can afford. Right in the hat.

130
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,266
Seems fair to me.

131
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:17,541
Anything you wanna give, for the
fastest gun on the face of Earth.

132
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,818
- Thanks.
- There you go, folks.

133
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,750
See? Even the wind is
on our side.

134
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,686
Watch the hat. Watch the hat.

135
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,598
Thanks. Thank you. Thanks.

136
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,166
Remember, folks,
you've just seen a risky show.

137
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,202
I mean,
that is for Duc Foster.

138
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,567
Whatever you can afford.

139
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,375
I really appreciated it.

140
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,978
Ah, thanks.

141
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:57,872
Thank you.

142
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:08,916
Hey, that 's Tucumcaril!

143
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:11,595
- This is for your collaboration.
- That 's the cavalry coach!

144
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:23,503
Bring these horses and take them
to the stables. Give them water.

145
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,540
After they're ready,
you can have some fun.

146
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:28,610
Right, sir.

147
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,650
The Wild West.

148
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,591
Oh, boy!

149
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:45,385
Forgive the reception, sir.

150
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:47,224
We've been expecting a group
of young ladies...

151
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:50,265
to work in the brothel house
and the boys made a mistake.

152
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,936
The mistake was made
when you were elected sheriff.

153
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:56,699
Don't you see that I'm a Colonel?
For your information, young man...

154
00:22:56,908 --> 00:23:00,105
we are on our way to
Fort Cristobal.

155
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:04,507
Major Cabot may at least
have sent someone to meet me.

156
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:09,915
<i>Oh</i>,<i>my darllng</i>,<i>oh</i>,<i>my darllng</i>
<i>Oh</i>,<i>my darllng Clementlne</i>

157
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,283
<i>You are lost and gone forever</i>

158
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:16,257
Hey, Duc,
you better pick it up.

159
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:24,026
Duc, why don't
you just go home?

160
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:28,838
You've been lucky, friend.
Now I've got a job to do.

161
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,029
So do I.

162
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,010
Come in.

163
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,685
She was just a child.
You hear me? A mere child.

164
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,120
- Who was?
- My sister! You raped her!

165
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:50,158
You never waited!
You promised to marry her.

166
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:53,195
- Help...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

167
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:59,098
Yeah, let me hear you. I want you
to scream in front of everybody!

168
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:03,206
- Help!
- You ravished my only little sister!

169
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:07,374
- The man is a maniac!
- You broke her heart!

170
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,710
- He's not a maniac, he's an ass.
- Hey, what 's up with you?

171
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,083
The beard. The beard!

172
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:22,284
- Yeah, that 's the key to it all.
- What key?

173
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:25,361
- The key to the perfect plan.
- Hey, you listen.

174
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,759
This ain't none of your business.

175
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:31,402
Thanks the good idea, Duc,
but this ain't none of your business.

176
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:35,835
- What are you doing? Don't push me.
- Come on, like a good boy. Out.

177
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,030
Don't do that!

178
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:40,334
My balls!

179
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,423
That 's a fascinating hand
you got on you.

180
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:04,534
- I never saw such a deep life line.
- It 's not a live line, it 's a scar.

181
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,966
I disarmed a man once by
by grabbing his knife blade.

182
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,697
Live line interrupted.

183
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:13,571
You go from bad to worse, Colonel.
Death lines and ambush by Indians.

184
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:16,144
Don't try to join Major Cabot.
You'll never get there alive.

185
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,442
You are a maniac too,
aren't you, boy?

186
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:22,381
A friend of mine's got red
whiskers just like yours, Colonel.

187
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,111
Fake, but you could never tell.

188
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:27,120
We can send him ahead of
you with your uniform on.

189
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:32,126
But don't try to go to the fortress
yourself, 'cause you'll get killed.

190
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,497
Lieutenant! Men!

191
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:43,840
Men! Soldiers! Help!

192
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,012
Keep on washing.
I'm just being followed.

193
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,374
Are you a bandit?

194
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,976
Stop!

195
00:25:56,855 --> 00:26:01,189
You don't look the least like those
ruffians on the wanted posters.

196
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:06,228
Do they make look like that on
purpose? To frighten the public?

197
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,160
Well...

198
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,864
they're trying to show
the evil that there's inside us.

199
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,038
Stop!

200
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:17,938
- Kiss me.
- What?

201
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:22,603
Papa'll send me back to Washington.
I never kissed an outlaw.

202
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:25,146
When I tell my girlfriends,
they'll die of envy.

203
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,875
Kiss me, or I scream!

204
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,644
Sure.

205
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,024
There was a madman in my room!
And another, a maniac!

206
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,789
They both wanted to kill me!
The both wanted!

207
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:44,196
Surround the hotel!
Find those men!

208
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,951
- There's a man in her bed!
- There's a man in her bed?

209
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:07,147
There's a man in her bed!

210
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,493
- Where?
- Right here!

211
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:26,672
Hey.

212
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:44,217
Oh, God.

213
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:48,225
Oh, God, save me.

214
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:52,062
Just this once,
and I swear I'll never do it again.

215
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,536
He's over there!

216
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:05,831
Get out! Come on, get out of here!
Dogs, come on, leave me alone!

217
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:11,277
Come on, get out of here!
My chicken! My poor little chicken!

218
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:15,783
Come on now! Get out!
Leave me alone! Go on!

219
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:19,150
My poor little chicken! What are you,
a priest or a chicken thief?

220
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,587
Oh, you horrible robbers!
Go on, get!

221
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:25,422
Don Felipe, you catholics
keep chickens in your church?

222
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,962
My God,
we caught the wrong man!

223
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,258
We caught the right
chicken farmer.

224
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:32,402
You chicken thieves!
You'll pay for this! God will damn you!

225
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,970
He can't.
We're working for Him.

226
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:39,633
You thieves, you chicken thieves!
Oh, my poor chickens!

227
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:43,439
Come, sons.
Let 's go to the river.

228
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:14,635
- What kind of place is this?
- It 's a place of worship. Come on.

229
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:19,215
All aboard, kids.
Keep going. Come on.

230
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:22,784
They're all beautiful girls,
as you can see.

231
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:26,320
- Where are you going, friend?
- I'm going over there to see her.

232
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,585
You just wait here
and behave yourself, huh?

233
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:32,126
Hey, Mike.
How you doin'?

234
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,288
- Get a move on.
- Hey.

235
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,558
Don't miss your connection.

236
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:46,705
- Two hundred.
- You wanna take a better look?

237
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:49,573
It 's solid silver
and blessed by a priest.

238
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,807
They used to cut the hands
of church robbers.

239
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:56,180
Two hundred is my offer.
Bag included.

240
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,365
Carrousel off to paradise
right now.

241
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:16,165
It isn't a better way
to spend your money.

242
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,120
Come on, you faggots!

243
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:06,613
Are you for a change
trying to screw me, Madam?

244
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,392
Lucy?

245
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,393
The offer stays
at two hundred.

246
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,589
Take it or leave it.

247
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,825
Lucy!

248
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,164
Lucy, come back!

249
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,566
It 's an order!

250
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:54,266
On board, gents!
The girls are ready and waiting.

251
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,408
Howdy, Steam Engine.
I've been looking for you.

252
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:06,208
Now that you found me, it 's buddies
forever and I'll see you around.

253
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,147
Come on,
let 's empty the hall.

254
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,652
Come on.

255
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:18,162
Now, wait, Bill.
I haven't seen him for ages.

256
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,760
- We haven't hardly said hello.
- You call that say hello?

257
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:26,095
One more time around,
and you'll be expected.

258
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:29,164
- What 's wrong with that?
- Don't tease him, Lucy.

259
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:31,569
- He gets jealous.
- Jealous?

260
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:37,708
I've got more things on my mind.
I pulled her out of the gutter.

261
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:41,407
She was a free ride. I washed her,
ironed her, and combed her hair.

262
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:45,180
I made a lady out of her.
I surrounded her with luxury.

263
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,483
I catered to her every whim.

264
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,422
She cost me
an eye and an ear.

265
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:55,361
But I already told you,
if you want her, name your price.

266
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:57,557
I can't do it.

267
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,099
- She's priceless.
- Name your price, Joe.

268
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:05,106
Please...
name your price.

269
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:21,852
Don't be surprised, brothers...

270
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:27,228
and, above all, do not jump
to the wrong conclusions.

271
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,563
I'm here to perform
an act of justice.

272
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,485
There he is. That 's him.

273
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:58,060
- "Thou art the man."
- Now you are an informer, huh?

274
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,822
You've been touched
by the grace of God.

275
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,432
Isn't that so, my son?

276
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:07,092
- Admit it, you've been touched.
- I've been touched.

277
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:10,331
Is it in here, my son?

278
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,936
Check it carefully, Father.

279
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:19,639
When I found you half dead on the
desert, why didn't I leave you?

280
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,876
'Cause you never
double-cross a friend.

281
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:25,487
It 's all there.

282
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,288
Thanks be the God.

283
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,483
- Thanks be the Joe.
- Just think of it.

284
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:32,993
The man before you
was already far away...

285
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:35,188
free and clear...

286
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:38,163
when, like Paul
on the road to Damascus...

287
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:41,167
he was struck by
God's Heavenly light.

288
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:43,840
Burnt with remorse,
he returned...

289
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:48,205
his heart heavy with despair
for his vicious, misspent life...

290
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:50,441
in sin and shame.

291
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:52,611
- Who's he talking about?
- You.

292
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,114
Me? Why...

293
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,719
But his noble gesture
would have remained unknown...

294
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:01,756
had it not been for the testimony
of this gold Christian soul.

295
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:05,994
Father, I only did my duty
as a faithful son of the church.

296
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,529
- Son of a bitch.
- But when the prodigal returns...

297
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:12,134
there's a rejoicing
in the Heavens above.

298
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:17,570
<i>Glory</i>,<i>glory</i>,<i>glory</i>

299
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:22,371
<i>On our knees</i>
<i>we're bendlng</i>

300
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:26,573
<i>Now the wrong prodlgal</i>

301
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:31,983
<i>Turns to the</i>
<i>rlghteous way</i>

302
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:36,752
<i>Glory</i>,<i>glory</i>,<i>glory</i>

303
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:41,796
<i>Praylng forthelr blesslng</i>

304
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:46,698
<i>All hearts In repentance</i>

305
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:51,466
<i>Bless be the Chrlst today</i>

306
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:54,873
<i>Glory</i>,<i>glory</i>,<i>glory</i>

307
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:57,912
Stop singing!
This is an honest house!

308
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:00,549
- Thank you.
- We don't make fun of the church.

309
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,446
Joe!

310
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:04,912
Joe!

311
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:31,047
- Where the hell is he taking us?
- Keep counting!

312
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:35,379
Where was I?
At 315, 32O...

313
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,714
US$ 325 in charity!

314
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:43,459
That old hag offered
two hundred, you know.

315
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:46,960
You see, Bill?
Honesty is the best policy.

316
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:50,361
You're rich and
you've been kissed by a priest.

317
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,399
Disgusting!

318
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:56,004
Why do you always have to act worse
than you already are?

319
00:37:56,207 --> 00:38:00,109
Yeah, sure. Twinkle Toes
here never pukes, does he?

320
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,643
Yeah, he does.
He doesn't do it in his hat.

321
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:06,146
He knows enough to do what he has
to do where the decent folks do it.

322
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,715
In the privy.

323
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:09,613
That 's where
you're wrong, Lucy.

324
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:13,717
If you spent less time walking
the streets like a gipsy...

325
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:17,223
and more time sitting
with decent folk on the privy...

326
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:20,488
you'd have met Joe
before you've met me.

327
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,409
Hey, I've been dreaming
a weird kind of dream.

328
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:40,209
A ray of the rising sun touches
the tops of the highest mountains...

329
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:43,581
so they seem to be
bathed in blood.

330
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:49,090
The peaks throw long shadows
down into the boundless valley.

331
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:53,061
And in the clear blue sky,
a hawk glides...

332
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:55,596
wide and easy.

333
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:58,793
- A whistling wind?
- No.

334
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,938
The wings clipping the air.

335
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,403
What 's that?

336
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:08,544
That 's horse's lopes.

337
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,875
And now...

338
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:16,349
from behind the rocks, appears
the figure of a man on a white horse.

339
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:19,018
He's the ancient ruler
of these lands.

340
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:23,421
The shadow of a dead king
reaches out for a fleeing man.

341
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:27,927
His silhouette is dark against
the red circle of the sun...

342
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,101
ringed with the halo
of eagle-feathers like...

343
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,702
...rays of light.
- Oh, yeah?

344
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:36,796
It 's your old man.
And he's looking for you.

345
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:40,306
My old man never had feathers.
I'm a white man.

346
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:43,071
I got a sunburn face,
but you can always tell a white man...

347
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,942
by the color of his ass.
Look!

348
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,209
What 's wrong
with being an Indian?

349
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:51,655
So your father's got feathers
and your mother was white.

350
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:55,883
So what? Black, white, red,
what difference does it make?

351
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:59,620
- We are somebody's children.
- I am the child of a white woman.

352
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,890
She was so white the other girls on
the whorehouse called her the ghost.

353
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,795
I'm not bragging,
I'm just getting the facts straight.

354
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,334
And what I've told you
is all I know.

355
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:10,439
I'm a lone wolf.
I don't run with the pack.

356
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,802
And do you know why
they call me Steam Engine?

357
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:17,140
'Cause I got fed up, I jumped the train
and ditched the whole crowd.

358
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,839
That 's right,
ditched the whole tribe.

359
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,450
"Man who gallops
on fire horses."

360
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,450
You got it far enough.
Come on!

361
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,782
Yeah, and you reached the end
of the road, Steam Engine.

362
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,619
- You crazy? You're gonna fight?
- Not me.

363
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:32,424
We're in the end of the track!

364
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,761
- What 's happening?
- Jump! Jump!

365
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:39,468
Bill!

366
00:40:56,353 --> 00:41:00,551
Bill, you all right?
Did you get hurt?

367
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,658
Yeah, yeah, I'm alright,
I'm alright, Lucy. I...

368
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,352
Hey, who ever planned
this railway end here?

369
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:09,829
Maybe they're gonna build a bridge
across the valley with a big town.

370
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:13,333
I remember this place
when it was nothing.

371
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,777
Is this where
the railway stop?

372
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:27,849
This here is the end of
the Western Railroad Company.

373
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,917
- That 's right.
- Sure it is.

374
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:35,717
Those are the tracks we got left.
And where's the Pacific, huh?

375
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:39,259
- Answer me that.
- He's right. Where is it?

376
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,693
Listen to what
I'm gonna tell you.

377
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:45,528
There's no future
for railroads in this country.

378
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:49,500
- And now where are you going?
- We're looking for a new job.

379
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:54,440
The company left us high and dry
and we're going out of here right now.

380
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:07,253
Joe, Bill, come on,
there's still some hot coffee.

381
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,119
Here, Joe.

382
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,585
Come on, Bill.

383
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:26,776
Hey, take it easy, Bill.
Don't go get yourself plastered.

384
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:30,242
I don't get plastered.
I just get happy.

385
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,972
Oh, come on,
you call that happy?

386
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:35,413
Indians are gloomy by nature.

387
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:39,120
Hang on to yourself, Bill.

388
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,450
The son of a chief shouldn't
fly off the hand like that.

389
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:45,060
Oh, yeah?
If I had a hand full of men...

390
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:47,992
men that really knew
where their balls are...

391
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:51,361
I'd screw this whole
goddamned country.

392
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:56,066
Loneliness.
That 's what it is.

393
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:59,003
The loneliness of genius.

394
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,943
Thousands dollars.

395
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:05,344
How much is that again?

396
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:09,517
That 's the amount
that the Major kept...

397
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,915
instead of turning over
the Indian Agency.

398
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:14,352
What do I have to do?

399
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:20,223
- You've been in the army?
- That 's right. Like all white men.

400
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,921
What rank?

401
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:23,258
Deserter.

402
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:30,803
- How do you like to be a Colonel?
- That could be nice for a change.

403
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,976
What do you say, Lucy?

404
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:35,805
I say, where you're
gonna get the uniform?

405
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:40,440
The uniform is on its way,
but you also are gonna need whiskers.

406
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,612
Whiskers?

407
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:44,848
Like this?

408
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:49,492
The Colonel you're standing in
for has a set, only his is real.

409
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:53,463
Then I grow my own.
Just give me time.

410
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:59,093
I could give you all the time you want,
you still wouldn't have whiskers.

411
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:01,905
They don't grow on Indians.

412
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:05,075
On me, they do,
because I'm not an Indian!

413
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:25,328
What is it?

414
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:28,861
Someone is coming.
A wagon or a stage...

415
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:46,077
I was just showing you what the
stupid redskins do to hear sounds.

416
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:47,716
They still do.

417
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:51,319
We have the telegraph and
they throw themselves on the ground.

418
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:55,856
- Coming this way?
- Who? How do I know?

419
00:44:56,060 --> 00:45:00,429
You believe you can put your ear to
the ground and hear a stagecoach?

420
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:03,032
- With an escort?
- No, but it 's been followed.

421
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,831
- How many riders?
- Four.

422
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,503
- Indians?
- No, the horses are shot.

423
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:10,498
There's gunfight,
Joe, they're shooting.

424
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:12,841
Yeah, I know.

425
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,273
How the Christ can you know if you
don't put your ear to the ground?

426
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:18,277
Tell me that.
How the hell can you know?

427
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:23,645
They are shooting at the Colonel
with the red beard.

428
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:07,494
You see? When you're not an Indian,
you've got to run.

429
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:11,896
Where are you? There's
the coach and there's the idiot.

430
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:15,196
But where are the four riders?

431
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:41,122
Here we are, Steam Engine.

432
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,394
Mortimer.

433
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:47,564
What do you do
with the beads on?

434
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:50,239
It 's the fashion, Bill.

435
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,773
But what ain't never
the fashion is witnesses.

436
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:56,842
Throw down your gun.

437
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:09,021
I'm sorry, Bill. You shouldn't
have seen what you just saw.

438
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:12,420
Why?
What did I just see?

439
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:15,063
You saw the Colonel.

440
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:18,791
You saw us,
made up in beads.

441
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,368
Oh, you got beads on, huh?

442
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:24,006
I swear to God
I never even noticed it.

443
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:26,142
In any case,
you noticed us, didn't you?

444
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:29,312
Me? No! No!

445
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:33,176
- Then, who you're talking to?
- Myself.

446
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:36,251
I always talk to myself.

447
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:38,717
You know how
prairie folk are like.

448
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:41,356
I talk and I listen.

449
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:45,050
Hoping that someone,
somewhere...

450
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:48,425
will hear and answer me!

451
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:49,997
For the God's sake, Mortimer.

452
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,169
For the sake of the old days
when we were together, side by side.

453
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:54,832
Remember?

454
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,098
Mortimer...

455
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:06,171
Jelly Roll would hate you
for even thinking in such an idea.

456
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:11,577
Why don't you answer me?

457
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:16,684
- Let 's cut it short.
- No!

458
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:20,386
This is joke. No.

459
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:24,155
Stop! Don't shoot.

460
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:33,439
- He's my brother.
- Well, Steam Engine...

461
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:37,136
where did you get
a hold of a sister like her?

462
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:41,011
Come on,
let 's have a better look.

463
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:52,522
Be a good girl.
Ring up the curtains.

464
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:55,425
If you wanna save your brother's
life and make us all happy...

465
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:58,294
you're gonna have to split
yourself into four.

466
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:06,832
Stop!

467
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:09,308
Don't you lay
a hand on my girl!

468
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:12,505
Christ, how many
are you back there?

469
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:16,711
Leave out the woman and
the unarmed man, it 's just me.

470
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,481
But I split myself into four,
if that will make you all happy.

471
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:25,424
Cool off, buster. We're only meant
to have a little fun with your girl.

472
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:27,994
Why not, Joe?

473
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:32,259
Why don't have a little fun?
Let 's all have a little fun.

474
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,835
What 's wrong with that?

475
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:39,071
Why take changes, darling?

476
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:42,404
There are too many of them.

477
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:47,282
Throw down your gun.

478
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:50,814
Throw it down, darling.

479
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:19,148
- Damn it, I missed!
- Yeah, naturally, he moved.

480
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,475
What do you mean,
naturally?

481
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:24,518
You learnt to shoot in a circus.
You can't hit but a sitting target.

482
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:28,282
Yeah, throw it away. You're
better off with a bow and arrow.

483
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:31,120
I was so scared!

484
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:34,560
You know, Lucy, keep it up
and I will name my price.

485
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:36,665
Name it!

486
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,358
- Oh, Bill!
- How come?

487
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:43,096
How come you go calling him
"darling" and me "brother"?

488
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:46,670
The true fact is
I can't make up my mind with it.

489
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:50,643
I don't know each one of you
I love most.

490
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,380
I told you, but you had
to have your own way.

491
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:05,391
I'm gonna die!

492
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:09,463
Well, we're sorry as we can be.

493
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:18,940
- Yeah, it 's real!
- Please...

494
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:22,936
don't let me die like this
not knowing...

495
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:26,377
- What, Colonel?
- Why do you all keep...

496
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:30,485
pulling my beard?

497
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:39,353
Too bad.
I didn't have time to tell him.

498
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:42,293
And in a little while, Major Cabot
will know the Colonel is dead.

499
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:45,491
- That 's ground one.
- Yeah.

500
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:49,167
Oh, he's beginning
to get the hand of it.

501
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:50,498
Jesus, he's moving.

502
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:55,069
He's not heading for Cabot.

503
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:01,647
He's going to Jelly Roll.

504
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:05,149
What 's this Jelly Roll like?

505
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:08,390
Believes in an eye for an eye.

506
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:12,551
Well, we didn't get all of them,
did we? One got away.

507
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:15,595
Yeah, but three of them are dead.

508
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:19,996
So? Everything depends on
how you tell it.

509
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:24,071
He did it. He killed the three of them,
shot right between the eyes.

510
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:28,005
But he threw me the gun, Jelly Roll.
I'd never let myself shoot your men.

511
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:30,839
Hey, keep moving, come on!

512
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:35,812
Yeah, and you call their attention
with your creamy tights.

513
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:38,283
I didn't force them
to look, did I?

514
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:41,946
Too bad you can't hit a moving target.
Poor Steam Engine.

515
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:45,120
That 's right,
but I was wise to it.

516
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:48,024
And I got out of the way.

517
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:50,859
- You see?
- I can hit six out of six!

518
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:55,233
But you didn't know
that Mortimer was...

519
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,099
wise to it.

520
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:59,705
No, I didn't.
Where did you go to?

521
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:01,309
To my right.

522
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:10,943
That 's what you should have done.
It 's easy to hit a moving target.

523
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:15,420
Okay, now there's only four of us
to know the Colonel is dead.

524
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:18,958
It 's a pleasure to do business
with a man who catches on so fast.

525
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:24,233
What are we gonna do
with Mortimer?

526
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:28,160
Bury him in a Mexican cemetery.
Your friend's a wise guy, huh?

527
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:32,171
- You can trust him, he's with me.
- Looks to me like you're with him.

528
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:35,708
Now let 's see if we can raise
the Colonel from the dead.

529
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:53,587
Steam Engine,
we are not ordinary people.

530
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:59,967
We are not ordinary people,
Major Cabot. We're Americans.

531
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:03,833
The Western Prairies must be firmly
anchored to our great country...

532
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:07,567
if we're gonna realize
our lovably ideals. How's that?

533
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:10,803
That would do.
Now the beard.

534
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:23,782
Jesus!

535
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:37,369
Well?

536
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:40,505
Well, well.
With the proper...

537
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,974
trousers and boots...

538
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:47,547
shoulders...

539
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,749
a little spit and polish
here and there...

540
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:57,284
- Well, what do you think?
- I think he's fine.

541
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:00,321
So do I.

542
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:08,196
Then there's no doubt about it.
They will shoot you.

543
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,668
Say it again, Bill,
keep saying it.

544
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:18,404
We are not ordinary people,
Major Cabot. We're Americans.

545
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:22,813
I know you know that. You've been
saying it over. The instructions.

546
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:26,045
God damn it, I'm fed up to
the teeth with this clowning.

547
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:28,918
You get to the fort,
you pass yourself off as Pembroke...

548
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,821
and confiscate
the US$ 3OO, OOO. Then what?

549
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:34,963
Then what? Then if they haven't me
strangled up, I head due East...

550
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:38,032
as fast as a jack rabbit
to where you're gonna meet.

551
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:41,397
If Cabot gives me an escort,
you're gonna stop the coach...

552
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:45,267
shove the gun into my Adam's apple,
and say, "Don't move or I shoot!"

553
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:47,943
- Go on.
- But if there's no escort...

554
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:51,272
you don't shove anything at me,
we beat the hell out there...

555
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:55,281
and live happily forever after
on a beach on the Sandwich Islands.

556
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,621
- That 's fine.
- Perfect. What are you sour about?

557
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:05,984
That would do, Michelangelo.

558
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,464
What am I so sour about?
Look at him!

559
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:12,066
You think, for a minute,
he's gonna pass for a cavalry man?

560
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:14,361
And you think, for a minute,
you're gonna pass for a Colonel?

561
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:16,732
That 's what I'm saying!

562
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:21,604
They won't even let us into the fort.
They'll eat us alive!

563
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:24,275
Too bad for them.
Let 's go.

564
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:58,447
A wagon without driver.

565
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:22,863
Who the hell are you
talking to? Me?

566
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:24,733
A Colonel in the
United States army?

567
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:34,811
Keep on croaking. Can't
understand a word you're saying.

568
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:37,282
If what you're saying
is words.

569
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:43,552
Well, before it withers,
you know what you can do with that.

570
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,560
Hey! Let 's have
a little respect here.

571
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:48,924
This is the man who sees
beyond the mountains.

572
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,123
And I'm the man who sees right
in front of his nose.

573
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:54,326
And if an old redskin
can see it too, I'm screwed!

574
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:00,766
- What the hell was that?
- The Western Railroad Company.

575
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:05,107
Back on its relentless march to
the sea. Bill, that 's where I get off.

576
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,873
Good luck, Colonel Pembroke.

577
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:09,779
I'm afraid that plan is too big
for that old Indian.

578
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:14,514
Hey, Joe. Give old coachman
a hand, will you?

579
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:21,487
Attention!

580
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:42,343
Attention!

581
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:52,618
Colonel.

582
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:11,711
Welcome to Fort Cristobal, Colonel.
I'm Major Cabot.

583
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:16,852
- We are not ordinary people, Major.
- Later, daddy.

584
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:20,953
And this young lady, I presume,
is Miss Pembroke?

585
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,518
Yes, presumably,
she's my daughter.

586
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:26,593
"Full many a flower is born to blush
unseen and waste...

587
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:28,855
its sweetness
on the desert air."

588
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:32,458
Should we go inside?

589
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:44,143
Major, who did you build
the gallows for?

590
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:47,339
Oh, that Indian, sir.
