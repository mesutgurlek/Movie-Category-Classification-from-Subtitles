1
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,380
It is Miguel!

2
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,900
There is no help out here.

3
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,900
- You ought to pour me a little down here.
- Your credit has been drunken up.

4
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,820
You, at the bar...

5
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,380
Hear me out there?

6
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,180
Turn around.

7
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,380
I'm talking to you.

8
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,780
I don't ask it again.

9
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,865
Hey, mister!

10
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,260
Wait up there.

11
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,660
- You're sure a pretty good killer.
- Not to tell that I'd wish to be one.

12
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,940
- Where you're from?
- No place in particular.

13
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,340
- Where are you headed?
- Same place.

14
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,940
I did really appreciate that drink.

15
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,380
I'd like to make it up with you, maybe
discuss a business proposition with you.

16
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,900
In case you didn't notice,
I tend to attract trouble.

17
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,740
Well, I noticed that you got
out of it pretty damn good.

18
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,580
- These fellows, they...
- Regulators.

19
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,940
I guess they must've made you
a pretty important man, huh.

20
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,220
Half a million dollars.
That's what I want to discuss with you.

21
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,020
If you grab one of the chickens
I'll cook you one up.

22
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:08,140
It ain't much, but at least keeps
the rain out. Make yourself at home.

23
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,500
- You're as hell jumpy, mister.
- No. Suspicious.

24
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:59,020
- Why them regulators were trying to kill you?
- Religious differences.

25
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,580
Religious differences?

26
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:08,180
I never know a regulator had a religion.
They ain't nothing but a rich man hard law.

27
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:14,460
- I killed someone.
- Why don't that surprise me. Who?

28
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:24,260
I just figure if we are partners now,
I should know who's trying to kill us.

29
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,700
Maybe I should strangle
one of these chickens

30
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:30,820
for the trail and go on.

31
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,693
I'm just wondering how

32
00:09:34,694 --> 00:09:38,700
a man gets such bad enemies and all.

33
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,020
I never had any good ones.

34
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,820
The whole thing started
right at the end of the war.

35
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,500
A Federate captain by the name
of Cluster and four of his men,

36
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,140
they disappeared with what was
left of the Confederate war chest.

37
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:16,980
With a half of a million dollars in gold.
As the story goes they disappeared into Mexico.

38
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,620
About three months later, the
captain was all sick of fevers

39
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,940
chills up in Huntsville, Alabama.

40
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,780
They hang him for a pig-headed
Confederate troops,

41
00:10:26,815 --> 00:10:32,420
maybe the one who was still fighting a war.
The one Jefferson had long given up on.

42
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,420
And it shows up about the gold?

43
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,540
- But a map.
- You have this map?

44
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,780
I got a part of it.

45
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,305
See Captain Cluster, he thought
the South was gonna rise again and

46
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:52,020
a half million dollars would help, but the
gold was a temptation and he put the map

47
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,340
in four pieces. He gave
it to four of his men.

48
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,180
Told each of them was to meet him
in Aberdeen three years later.

49
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,220
But he was dead inside of two days.

50
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,566
So why didn't the four of you just put
the pieces together there and then?

51
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:08,860
We couldn't because we didn't
know who each other was.

52
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,980
Two days after the Lee's
surrender I took a bullet.

53
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:19,780
I had to cut off my leg.

54
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,500
So what happened in Aberdeen?

55
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:30,380
All went bad. Dye, Colby and me.
That's the three of us that turned up.

56
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,973
We never knew who the fourth man
was... It seems he

57
00:11:32,974 --> 00:11:35,540
did some whiskey talking
one on night to

58
00:11:35,575 --> 00:11:36,775
a bunch of red-legs and

59
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,300
Colonel Skinner takes his part
and gets the whole story.

60
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,620
So, Skinner he shows up and
has it made he's one of us.

61
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,940
But Colby recognized him,
and all hell broke loose.

62
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,500
And Colby and he died?

63
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:58,740
The last time I heard Colby is doing some
time down in Del Rio, Mexican territory.

64
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,980
- And still no one knows
where this money is? - No.

65
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:14,620
But the Red Legs has got pieces of that
map and I ain't gonna stop to find all.

66
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,620
Red Legs and Regulators...

67
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,620
the only thing that came out of
war is a new name for killers.

68
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,060
Amen.

69
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,820
- So why do you tell me all this?
- Because I need a partner.

70
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,580
If I hadn't lost my leg and I could
still get around, I wouldn't need you.

71
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,533
I think maybe you're confused
about who I am.

72
00:12:42,534 --> 00:12:44,420
You bought me a drink.

73
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,660
That's a hell of a lot kindness
I've been shown a long time...

74
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,620
Besides, you can shoot.

75
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,820
And I know if you'd decide you're
gonna kill me for gold,

76
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,460
you ain't gonna make no bad job
out of it and leave me dying slow.

77
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:06,980
I can't go alone and I can't stand the idea
the Yankees vigilantes finding that gold.

78
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,140
Why now? It's been sitting there
for a while. Why the rush?

79
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,580
Because I've seen one of them.

80
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:21,340
- Where?
- Right here. About a week ago.

81
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,945
- I've seen him but he didn't see me.
- So that's hope passing a fact.

82
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,620
Well I'm still here talking, ain't I?
Time is running out. They're getting close.

83
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,580
Let's see that map.

84
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:51,140
Four different holsters, four different men.
You put them together and you got the map.

85
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,540
And when you got the map you got the gold.

86
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:23,700
- Regulators.
- We figured on burying them...

87
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:32,860
I don't know what happened first hand.
This gentleman...

88
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,820
- Dragging a pine coffin
along with him? - Yeah.

89
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,700
Where is he now?

90
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:20,020
A wagon and a horse.
Maybe 10, 12 hours ago.

91
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,780
They're not alone.
Maybe 15 riders trailing them.

92
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,700
Horseshoe markings say
they're Union ponies.

93
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,980
Damn! That hurts!
What the hell did you do that for?

94
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,860
We leave in five minutes.
I won't wait.

95
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,420
Where the hell do you think you're going?
You don't even know where's Colby's jail.

96
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,180
In five minutes I won't care.

97
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,020
Listen, I'm sorry about
that picture. I'd be proud.

98
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:09,180
Is that your family? A real
nice family you got there.

99
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,220
- You don't like to talk much, do you?
- No.

100
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,700
- Is it me?
- It might get to be.

101
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,340
Until how long?
Do you ever talk to yourself?

102
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,020
Yeah. And I've the good sense
to know when to shut up.

103
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,540
What do you talk about?

104
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,220
No one else finds me this fascinating.
Why do you?

105
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,620
Well, it ain't that
you're so fascinating,

106
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,180
it's just that you're the alone here.
So, what do you talk about?

107
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:55,780
A prayer: "Dear God, save me
from one-legged drunts."

108
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,740
Well, I reckon you should
have prayed harder, huh?

109
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,820
Do you got any idea how
us to get in this place?

110
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,100
- You could start shooting each other.
- We've come to visit someone.

111
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,700
- Who?
- A man with the name Jacob Colby.

112
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,460
- You can?
- We can be if it'll help.

113
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:24,660
- Visiting or moving in, Dooley?
- A social chat.

114
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,540
You got a smoke?

115
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,180
- Weighed you. You're better than
I expected... - Just this once.

116
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,620
Meaning?

117
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:47,220
Well, this is my last meal. And you
two are the first and last visitors.

118
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:52,500
Being that this is my last night
at earth. Who the hell are you?

119
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,340
The man that gives you a last smoke.

120
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,060
We kind of thinked how
to break you out.

121
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:06,660
The only way out is way up the wall.
You got a light for this?

122
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,980
So where's the holster?

123
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:29,020
- That piece of information dies with me
- Why? It ain't doing you no damn good.

124
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:34,940
It never has. But I don't see, facing a
firing squad will give me the comfort that

125
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,860
someone else, even you Dooley,
is gonna enjoy that gold.

126
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:44,180
Well, if I did promise not to enjoy?

127
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,380
You might succumb to the temptation.

128
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,060
You're a nasty no-good son of a bitch.
Do you know that, Colby?

129
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,940
Watch me tomorrow, they're gonna
march out in that cope yard,

130
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:01,100
and tie me to that post, and shoot me.

131
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:18,740
If the village of Pedraz is to survive,
we must stand together.

132
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,540
We must put faith in
ourselves and into God.

133
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,060
To not do this, is giving in
to these renegades.

134
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,687
They wear uniforms, it make them
Federales. It make them beyond the law.

135
00:21:32,688 --> 00:21:34,780
But not beyond justice.

136
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,780
You better forget justice.
They do what they want.

137
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:51,585
I've come from the village of Quello.
Here too they have taken all we had.

138
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,700
They barely left us our sweat!
More is what they want, always more.

139
00:21:55,735 --> 00:21:59,180
You see?
To give in accomplishes nothing.

140
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,540
The Reds, the Reds!

141
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,780
Stop it!

142
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,820
There's a lack of Christian spirit
in your pasture, Padre.

143
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,980
We are your protectors, yet
you predict against us.

144
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,540
- You sent riders for help against us.
- You bring us dead men.

145
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:40,740
- Some lessons are hard brought on, Padre.
- You take what little we have.

146
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,180
You bleed every village in this valley.

147
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,374
And when there's no more blood,
you'll burn them?

148
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,700
You're an insightful man, Padre.

149
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,140
A donation for your church, Padre.

150
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,020
There have been for years stories of
gold coins that grow in the valley's dust.

151
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,660
Gold buried by the desperate forces
of the Civil War of the United States.

152
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:28,340
I, of course, do not believe such stories.
But I believe in that.

153
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,940
- That's all you believe in?
- Have you found this treasure, Padre?

154
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,460
- And live like this?
- You're a cautious man.

155
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,900
- Do you know where it is?
- No. I'll have no more to say to you.

156
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:50,300
You'll have much to say
if I find you have lied.

157
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:56,660
- What happened to turn the other cheek, Padre?
- I'm too tired to turn bloody cheeks!

158
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,820
Forgive me, Father,
for what I plan to do.

159
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:24,700
Help us. Send someone, 
someone with the courage I lack.

160
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,940
Send someone to kill this man.

161
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,380
Ready.

162
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,420
Aim.

163
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,860
Fire!

164
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,460
Do we ride on Dooley, Colonel Skinner?
We'd have them in no more than 10 minutes.

165
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,100
- And then we wouldn't have all
four holsters? - No, sir, but...

166
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,580
They are on a down-way road to hell.
We're gonna be there to greet them.

167
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,260
- Fetch time.
- What?

168
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,580
- What's the gun for?
- I don't know... It cut out small talk.

169
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,180
Take the gun away.

170
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,980
- We didn't come to hurt you, Jacob.
- Not yet anyway.

171
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,460
After all I've been through, do you
think a gun is gonna scare me?

172
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,900
Well, it don't and you don't.
And you can't make me talk.

173
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,140
I can make you wish you had.

174
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,460
Damn, Colby. Before the jail break
you had yourself lonesome.

175
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:30,580
- I didn't ask you to break me out.
- Which is why it was a nice gesture of ours.

176
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:36,460
I suggest you tell us.
Patience ain't exactly his strong suit.

177
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,900
What is?

178
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,060
Shooting people is
making me impatient.

179
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,140
This whole damn thing is crazy.

180
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,350
The best chance we got to find
that gold is we all stick together.

181
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:53,380
There's plenty around. What marches ya?
A bullet in the back?

182
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:59,700
- Guess prison makes a man cynical, huh?
- I guess times made you too dumb to be cynical?

183
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,220
- Gentlemen, we're getting to the impatient part.
- Why? I'm just giving it up.

184
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:09,740
- You better tell us.
- I sure wish I knew where it was.

185
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:14,180
But I lost it in a poker game. I lost
the holster, I lost the gun, the money...

186
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,620
Where did you lose it at?

187
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,860
In Sterling. A man named...

188
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,380
- ...some gambler.
- Did you know what he has?

189
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:36,700
- I was drunk. I did do some talking...
- Damn, Colby. Did you tell him or not?

190
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:43,940
What's it matter? He only had one piece.
Is there only a chance you believe me?

191
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:50,060
I told you all I had to tell!
What the hell are you doing this for?

192
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,580
Or perhaps I sleep with my open eyes...

193
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:58,460
Don't look at me.
It's your own damn fault.

194
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,900
That's him, he.

195
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,380
Whisky.

196
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,260
You got something of
that cold coming on?

197
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,580
I can't drink with my hands tied.

198
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,980
You know, what happening is wrong?

199
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,780
I mean we folks have the same
enemies, believe in the same things.

200
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,300
Now I am the one who's tied up, and he's
the one who's gonna walk and get our map.

201
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:06,020
I didn't know realize it was our map.
And what's all these care taking for?

202
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,220
It's too late for the South to rise
again, Dooley, the same man knows that.

203
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:14,060
And I figure you're still clinging
to a taste sanity...

204
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:19,060
That cowboy is gonna take off with our gold
and we'll end up dead. I know this Akers.

205
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:25,660
Well, I've seen this cowboy shooting.
The man has an incredible talent.

206
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:31,020
And Akers owns the town. Sometimes
it just come down to numbers.

207
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:36,780
Man for man, we shot them northern
boys. They just kept coming.

208
00:32:36,815 --> 00:32:39,700
Nobody is made of lead.

209
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,140
At least we can do is even up
the odds for the cowboy.

210
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,500
What's happened to you, Dooley?

211
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,740
There was a time that you whacked
up the floor with this Akers.

212
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,900
Yeah, the times have changed.

213
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,900
It has nothing to do with time.

214
00:33:02,935 --> 00:33:05,500
You just gave up on being a hero.

215
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:25,380
- You look like you could use some company.
- Not with people in any case.

216
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:30,620
- You're not real friendly.
- I'm getting by...

217
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:38,260
That holster, where did you get it? My boss has
one just like that, he might be buying yours.

218
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,120
I'm not interested in selling.

219
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:45,180
Really? Well, my advice is
you speak with him first.

220
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:53,220
- That's no advice, sounds like a warning.
- Either way, he's waiting upstairs.

221
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,820
Don't worry about your drink.
I'll make sure it don't go to waste.

222
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,060
Stop here.

223
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,060
Knock.

224
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,020
- You got to be mad.
- Drop the gun.

225
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,860
Now, the holster.

226
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,820
Well, I can't say I can
put a conclusion to it.

227
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,860
It's south to the river.
It looks like Mexico.

228
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,180
We better find Dye.

229
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:41,580
If you'd get me tied up, cowboy.
It ain't fair.

230
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,940
He gave help.

231
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:50,900
All right. See, you remember: you ain't
fast enough and you ain't smart enough.

232
00:38:50,935 --> 00:38:53,900
- For what?
- For anything.

233
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,380
He has been here.

234
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,700
One man, with four eyes...

235
00:39:39,735 --> 00:39:41,065
Do you know him?

236
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:46,180
- No, I never met him. - Better you
don't. He's damn fast with the gun.

237
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,380
- Someone is always faster.
- He's the one.

238
00:39:49,415 --> 00:39:52,700
- For what?
- The one who's always faster.

239
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,820
He'll have his chance to prove it.
Where is he headed from here?

240
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,180
I wasn't inclined to ask.
What has he done?

241
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:07,700
- He brought down a son.
- Aren't the others too looking for him?

242
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,660
- Others?
- Red Legs.

243
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:15,060
They came an hour later. They rode
in, took a look, and rode out.

244
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,900
- So he have been seeing on the tail.
- Red Legs will always.

245
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,540
The man has a talent
for making enemies.

246
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:28,500
He took something of mine.
And I'd like it back.

247
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:33,660
A pair of matching leather holsters.
A $1,000 reward for the return.

248
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,540
- Sentimental value.
- It must've been your mam's.

249
00:40:37,575 --> 00:40:42,065
- Well?
- I'm not interested.

250
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,700
Whose son he killed that
it's so damn important?

251
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,700
Mine.

252
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,460
If we force these horses,
they're gonna drop.

253
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,820
If we don't get ground on, we're
gonna lose him to the Red Legs.

254
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:03,380
- Well, dead is dead.
- I don't want him dead.

255
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,500
I'm looking for a gentleman 
named Troy Dye.

256
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,820
They got a nice way of life,
these people got around here.

257
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,020
Fighting this land has no future.

258
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:05,260
- What do you know about the future? - Nothing.
But I know enough about not having one.

259
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,780
You found out anything?

260
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,700
They will trade a hot meal
for a little help.

261
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,340
About Dye, you mean?

262
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,380
Yep!

263
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:37,660
Damn. This border is on
all time inconsiderate.

264
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,700
Now, we got to get our sentimental
stuff out of the way...

265
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,980
Have you ever seen a body
close up after it's been...

266
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,420
No.

267
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:53,020
Me neither. But no matter how I think
about it, it don't come out pretty.

268
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,660
That's why you're gonna dig.

269
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,580
I got him!

270
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,380
Dooley, here he lies!

271
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:29,060
I'd say he looks any worse
than being dead.

272
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:35,740
There it is. Right behind on his hip.

273
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,780
Here.

274
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:01,700
What kind of idiot thing
you're doing now, Colby?

275
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,524
I'm just pealing out, Dooley.
Skinner has a piece of this map.

276
00:44:05,525 --> 00:44:07,900
And I don't see it fitting no matter
how good that cowboys is with a gun.

277
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:12,300
So maybe I sell them to pieces or
maybe I sell them back to Akers.

278
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:19,460
Either way we ain't getting any closer. And even
if we did I can see at the cowboy no peace for me.

279
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,580
- Ain't that right, cowboy?
- Just now.

280
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,060
You're a damn fool,
you know that, Colby.

281
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,300
I reckon we ought to bury him.

282
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,700
You... find the head and
I'll bury the rest of it.

283
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:07,100
Like you said bury his body too.

284
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:17,340
- Colby, he was once a friend.
- And once he wasn't.

285
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:25,420
It was wrong that man ended like this.
It's not I never killed anybody before.

286
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,980
You want an absolution?
Try the church, not me.

287
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:33,220
You know something? You're 
a hell of a shot killing one.

288
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:36,580
But in the human department
you need some basic requirements.

289
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,380
How come you didn't draw out on 
Colby when you had the chance?

290
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,820
You seemed to have things
pretty well on hand.

291
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,500
Fuck, I'm in for a drink.

292
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:10,540
And maybe a little something to eat.
I promise, I'll talk to you.

293
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:06,780
Do you think that once you've shooten
me, is gonna improve your situation?

294
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:13,060
- Are you looking for me, Skinner?
- No. I found you, one-legged son of a bitch.

295
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:17,820
- My arm is going numb.
- If you drop me, you lose the whole thing.

296
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:22,460
- Before I'll be pulling this trigger.
- Yeah, well not if I pull first.

297
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:27,785
Somebody better shoot somebody.

298
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:30,433
Here is a rope.
I tie this up to that coach.

299
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:33,700
Now you act reasonable and
I'll pull your butt up.

300
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:39,260
No, you'll shoot me
and take the map.

301
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:55,860
- Your choice: gun, holster, rope.
- I'd choose before my arm's letting go, Skinner.

302
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:12,260
What the hell, Dooley? That rope wasn't tied off?
If I couldn't grab hold I'd have down with him!

303
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:15,580
You seemed to have things well on hand.

304
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:35,100
- Pedraza. That mean anything to you?
- No.

305
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:42,980
- I reckon there's a fountain and a tree?
- Yeah. But I don't know what that is.

306
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:48,140
Could be a well. The Captain was
not exactly a Leonardo da Vinci.

307
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,340
And no Magellan either.

308
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,900
That is definitely a ridge.

309
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:58,780
Whatever it is between these
two we ride here.

310
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:03,180
I'm gonna sleep, I'm bushed.

311
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,580
Do you think so?

312
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:10,060
Why? We ain't got any
Red Legs on the tail.

313
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:16,580
I heard him scream,
but I didn't see him die.

314
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:13,500
- That church shouldn't be here.
- Maybe it's the wrong town.

315
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,365
I think it's the only town.

316
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:20,740
I don't know about you, but I'm
gonna put me and these horses asleep.

317
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,540
Hey! Get out of here!

318
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:54,580
Get out!

319
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,380
What are we to do with such trouble?

320
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:18,580
You could feed them.

321
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:26,100
- Why are you here?
- I'm not sure where here is.

322
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:30,340
- Pedraza.
- Then I'm a tourist.

323
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:35,025
The only tourists who come here do
surely have a price on their heads.

324
00:58:35,026 --> 00:58:37,620
It sounds like people you'd avoid.

325
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:40,780
For the children.

326
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:46,780
You don't mind me, do you.

327
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:55,860
- You should have let me kill him.
- I will, I will...

328
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:59,380
After we learn why he is here.

329
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:51,820
I have come to welcome you.

330
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:57,260
- Welcome?
- And to thank you.

331
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:04,540
For helping those children. In truth
I'm surprised the captain did not...

332
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:06,780
Shoot me?

333
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:09,140
- There can be only one reason.
- That being...?

334
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:14,820
- The reason for you being here.
- What reason is that?

335
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:25,660
This village has been unlucky. There's
nothing that rides in that isn't bad news.

336
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:30,980
There's no one ever ride out with some
guidance or good. Look around you.

337
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:38,020
They're like dog waiting to be kicked.
People long ago forgot what this town meant.

338
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:44,340
If you could explain why 
you think I am here?

339
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:51,500
You will change all this. Perhaps
you do not yet notice yourself.

340
01:00:51,535 --> 01:00:53,700
Sometimes it just happens.

341
01:00:55,300 --> 01:01:00,260
There you can find a bed, a bath,
and food that will not kill you.

342
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:04,500
When you wish to talk to me,
I'll be waiting.

343
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:14,380
He is the man we have been waiting for.
Pray for him.

344
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:18,820
- Are you sure?
- Just see how he helped the children.

345
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:20,660
He is the man.

346
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:39,700
Do you mind?

347
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,580
Sorry.

348
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:50,460
One pesos for a simple bath,
two pesos for a bath with.

349
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:55,260
- With what? - With whatever it is
you like to get besides cleaning.

350
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:59,380
It's been too long between
baths for me to remember.

351
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:01,420
Well, you sure as hell look 
like you could use one.

352
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:07,380
I recommend you take the two pesos
bath. She's mighty friendly.

353
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:10,620
- We need to talk.
- Now?

354
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:14,740
See you later.

355
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:34,300
You just put a damper on
a hell of a romantic moment.

356
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:39,460
Well, here's another damper.
The Padre knows why we're here.

357
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:44,820
That shouldn't be a surprise. We'd be at the
fiesta with all the people who seem to know.

358
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:48,020
Did you find out what that church
got to do on our "x"?

359
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:52,100
I didn't ask. The Padre was
too damn happy to see me.

360
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,020
It makes me nervous.

361
01:02:56,820 --> 01:03:00,100
No one has ever been happy to see me.

362
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:13,180
It's got to be here?

363
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:36,380
I don't know. Maybe you took
some pretty big steps.

364
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:42,620
You see anything that looks more
promising? It should be right here.

365
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:11,220
Here.

366
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:21,580
That piece of cloth that's stuck under
there, this altar had to be moved.

367
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:27,420
I'm sorry to disturb your prayer.
I just came to lock up.

368
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:32,100
Don't bother, Padre.
These aren't prayers any ways.

369
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:09,740
I don't understand the gold has kept
this long and did go nowhere.

370
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:15,420
Dooley, you've waited four years for this.
I don't know why a tale is so important?

371
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:20,580
Is a matter of arithmetic.
It's been five years since I had any.

372
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:53,580
Are you ready?

373
01:05:58,460 --> 01:05:59,660
There it is.

374
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:58,180
You see? There was a reason
not to kill him.

375
01:06:58,420 --> 01:06:59,620
And what now?

376
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:02,660
No more reason.

377
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:44,780
I smell me some gold.

378
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:27,300
- How are you doing?
- Just edgy. You?

379
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:28,740
I'm fine.

380
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:07,380
They were here.

381
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:12,300
The place they just left is
about as close we seem  to get.

382
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,300
You're lost?

383
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:25,980
- I'm just looking for someone.
- Perhaps... were they Americans?

384
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:29,740
- You have seen them?
- What do you and your friend want?

385
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:31,980
That's none of your business.

386
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:39,300
There are five of us against two of you.
That can make it our business.

387
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,820
Actually, five to one.

388
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:50,500
Keep this a fair fight.
How about your men?

389
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:37,780
You have a short fuse, my friend.

390
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:42,260
No. No fuse and we're not friends.
Now let him go.

391
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:46,820
You're gonna tell me what you're
doing here, or I'll kill him.

392
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:50,804
If you kill him, you die too.
You're not immune.

393
01:13:50,805 --> 01:13:54,060
Just tell me about these other Americans
and you can walk away from this.

394
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:57,558
I don't have to tell you nothing.

395
01:13:57,559 --> 01:14:01,540
If you listen very carefully
you understand why you do.

396
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:29,340
I don't know, Padre.
You must be a big believer in miracles.

397
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:33,540
I'm sorry.
I didn't tell you this.

398
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:36,740
There is enough bloodshed.
And it's all the money.

399
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:39,380
When you did found the money
why did you let it there?

400
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:48,140
Because it didn't belong to us.
But at as times of dying out...

401
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:52,420
Little by little we give some out.
A coin here and there to help.

402
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:56,940
But then you found out
people have big mouths.

403
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:16,380
- Yeah?
- Nothing. I just...

404
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:24,380
There's a pretty good chance
we're both gonna get killed.

405
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:30,260
And I hate to die not known why you
ended up the way you ended up.

406
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:36,380
Well, then when we're dead and we've
ended up in the same place I'll tell you.

407
01:15:36,415 --> 01:15:41,420
Hey, honey, where are you?
Let that die after you.

408
01:15:41,455 --> 01:15:43,980
It sound dangerous.
You better attend to her.

409
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,780
My wife and child.

410
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:58,980
The photograph...

411
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:06,180
You see, I had a small farm,

412
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:09,660
staying between two
big pieces of land,

413
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:12,660
owned by a fellow named Reager.
when he couldn't buy it

414
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:16,900
his son, who wanted
to impress him,

415
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:20,580
went with some Regulars
and three coffins.

416
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:26,820
He said: you're off the land
and get the coffins,

417
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:33,740
And the shooting started. My wife and daughter
were dead. And then I killed Reager's son.

418
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:38,460
That's how this whole thing started.

419
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,820
There is one thing I don't understand.

420
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:52,140
You ain't exactly the kind of man who
walks across the road to avoid a fight.

421
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:54,460
So why I didn't end him?

422
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:02,020
- He didn't kill.
- He sure as hell tried to kill you.

423
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:04,620
Yes, I can remember.

424
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:15,860
You better go before she finds
herself another "Magnifico".

425
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:37,940
- There is only way in this fort.
- I reckon that's our one way out.

426
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:43,540
There're five things from
going in getting us gold.

427
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:49,380
Well, it ain't exactly gold now, is it?
We've been through some hard times to get here.

428
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:54,660
Something have come. They're looking
for you. They're hurting Father Ramon.

429
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:00,420
Where is the cowboy?

430
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:09,060
This man is not worth
protecting, Padre.

431
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:14,900
I don't know the man you are looking for.
The gold has already been taken...

432
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:17,700
- Gold?
- The Federales took it.

433
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:30,460
You don't scare me.

434
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:33,796
You're a very brave padre.

435
01:18:33,797 --> 01:18:37,380
Because sometimes
I even scare myself.

436
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:48,060
You're backing the wrong man. Give me
the cowboy and I'll get you back your gold.

437
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:55,100
You care for them, Padre.

438
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:00,860
You will tell them...
Tell them you made a mistake.

439
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:12,500
The one has let you very far straight.

440
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:46,260
The Cowboy and his men!

441
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:03,540
Prepare yourselves!

442
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:28,060
Robert E. Lee it is!

443
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:50,380
Come on, Dooley, get up! Let's go!

444
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:28,140
Are you ready?

445
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:31,740
I got to end this.

446
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:10,100
Well, if the balance gets achieved,
it ought to be achieved here.

447
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:22,380
Whatever I could take
is already taken.

448
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:55,420
There, it's making place.

449
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:03,420
Just out of curiosity, Padre...
How much gold did you lose?

450
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:10,020
I think of it as much we have.

451
01:29:10,055 --> 01:29:15,180
- We didn't come here planning on getting
that money from you. - I know.

452
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:20,780
It was God's intention.
And He only made me utilize it.

453
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:26,020
- Your underestimate you, Padre?
- Oh no, you underestimate yourself.

454
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:33,140
There. Now, everyone has
a bit of what they want.

455
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:45,220
It has been returned to safety.

456
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:53,180
You never did give a damn about the gold.
You were just killing time, huh?

457
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:25,980
I know after all we've been through, it
may seem dumb, but I wanna stay here.

458
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:31,940
The longer I live, the more after it
I consider what I think is dumb.

459
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:36,357
At least all that gold is gonna do some
good now. Once you'd stick around...

460
01:30:36,358 --> 01:30:38,780
there ain't nobody chasing you.

461
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:43,980
Sooner or later, I'll bring visit
from trouble. But you stay on.

462
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:49,580
I want you to know you always
got a place to come back to.

463
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:53,980
Thanks, Dooley.

464
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:58,620
I forgot my gold.

465
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:25,100
I'm going now. I think I leave you here.
It's a better and safer place than where I go.

466
01:31:26,860 --> 01:31:33,580
I'll think of you every day. And I hope
that from time to time you'll think of me.

467
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:42,860
I'll see you in a while.

468
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:42,180
Is my hero gonna come back?

469
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:48,380
Oh, I reckon he'll be around.
