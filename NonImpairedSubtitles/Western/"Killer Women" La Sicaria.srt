00:07:48,783 --> 00:07:52,052
<i>Muerte por inyección letal.</i>

168
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,089
You killed an A.D.A.

169
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:58,525
You killed an innocent woman
who devoted her life to justice.

170
00:07:58,593 --> 00:08:00,694
You have any remorse?

171
00:08:02,797 --> 00:08:06,932
How long have you been
sleeping with Jason Bluford?

172
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:09,869
Jason told me he was leaving her.

173
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:11,504
He wasn't going to go
through with the wedding

174
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:13,506
because he loves me.

175
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:14,773
But then he changed his mind.

176
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:16,309
We were supposed to meet.

177
00:08:16,377 --> 00:08:17,843
We were going to go away together,

178
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:19,978
leave Texas this morning.

179
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:21,213
When you were together,
where would you meet?

180
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,515
At the gym.

181
00:08:23,582 --> 00:08:24,916
<i>Always at the gym.</i>

182
00:08:25,016 --> 00:08:27,551
In the steam room.

183
00:08:27,618 --> 00:08:29,920
(Lowered voice) His office sometimes.

184
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:31,755
So you were supposed to
meet at the gym this morning,

185
00:08:31,822 --> 00:08:33,323
but Jason never showed up.

186
00:08:33,391 --> 00:08:37,560
And that bastard never even
bothered to answer your calls.

187
00:08:37,627 --> 00:08:39,662
(Lowered voice) That
must've felt real bad, huh?

188
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:42,331
You gave him eight months of your life.

189
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,834
He promised you everything,
and then he left you cold.

190
00:08:45,902 --> 00:08:47,270
So you... 

191
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:48,971
shot his wife.

192
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,806
If you couldn't have him, no one could.

193
00:08:51,874 --> 00:08:53,741
Is that right?

194
00:08:55,445 --> 00:08:56,478
Yes.

195
00:08:59,382 --> 00:09:01,383
Ms. Alvarez,

196
00:09:01,451 --> 00:09:03,685
can you remember if Jason
was right or left-handed?

197
00:09:07,855 --> 00:09:09,890
Right.

198
00:09:12,394 --> 00:09:14,462
(Man) Any idea of a motive?

199
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:17,697
(Reporter shouting at same
time, camera shutters clicking)

200
00:09:17,764 --> 00:09:20,967
(Man shouts indistinctly)

201
00:09:21,034 --> 00:09:24,170
(Shouting continues)

202
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:29,476
S.A.P.D. has arrested Martina
Alvarez in the shooting of

203
00:09:29,543 --> 00:09:32,377
Assistant District
Attorney Heather Endelsohn.

204
00:09:32,445 --> 00:09:36,215
Cause of death is a gunshot
to the middle of the chest.

205
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:38,584
So this is wrapped up?

206
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:40,319
(Mouth full) Salazar sure thinks so.

207
00:09:40,386 --> 00:09:43,054
There's nothing that man
likes more than a podium.

208
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:44,823
He is one hell of an investigator.

209
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,658
Alvarez wasn't sleeping with the groom.

210
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:48,126
She's lying.

211
00:09:48,193 --> 00:09:50,328
Well, then she just lied her
way into the death penalty.

212
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:52,330
Her nails were chipped.

213
00:09:52,397 --> 00:09:54,031
Is that supposed to break my heart?

214
00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:55,433
You don't shoot the wife of your soul mate

215
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:57,335
without looking like the
one he should've picked.

216
00:09:57,402 --> 00:10:00,238
Salazar has a confession,
and you have chipped nails.

217
00:10:00,305 --> 00:10:02,406
Jason Bluford was left-handed.

218
00:10:02,474 --> 00:10:05,275
Shooter guessed right-handed.

219
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:06,709
Do I need to tell you
why a woman would know

220
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:08,911
which hand her lover favors?

221
00:10:08,979 --> 00:10:11,881
(Salazar speaks indistinctly)

222
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:15,218
I saw fear in her eyes, lieutenant.

223
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:16,486
There's more to this case.

224
00:10:16,554 --> 00:10:18,921
Don't burn bridges with S.A.P.D., Molly.

225
00:10:18,989 --> 00:10:20,456
They're fully capable of conduct... 

226
00:10:20,524 --> 00:10:22,991
I didn't say they weren't capable.

227
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:25,294
Yes, the groom knew the
shooter. Yes, that is correct.

228
00:10:25,362 --> 00:10:26,495
I just said they're wrong.

328
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:43,699
Winston was scheduled to
meet with Heather Endelsohn

329
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:45,467
two days before she was shot.

330
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:48,103
Sorry, that's not coincidence.

331
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:49,772
My instincts are right on this.

332
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,041
What did Agent Winston tell you
was the reason for the meeting?

333
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:53,942
Idiot hung up on me.

334
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,911
But he knows I'll find him.

335
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,613
How many active cases do you have, Molly?

336
00:14:58,681 --> 00:15:00,314
15 in 3 counties.

337
00:15:00,382 --> 00:15:01,983
But?

338
00:15:02,051 --> 00:15:04,318
I'm going back for Alvarez.

339
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:06,988
Rangers support other agencies
when they lack resources.

340
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:09,256
That's not the case with S.A.P.D.

341
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:10,490
Are you telling me to drop this?

342
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,727
(Sighs) No. I agree with you.

343
00:15:13,795 --> 00:15:16,763
- It's odd D.E.A. was dealing with a state prosecutor.
- Mm-hmm.

344
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,498
Find out why.

345
00:15:18,566 --> 00:15:20,167
But keep S.A.P.D. in the loop.

346
00:15:21,702 --> 00:15:22,735
Yes, sir.

347
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,886
I forgot cream,

348
00:15:28,954 --> 00:15:33,424
but I also brought you
some toothpaste and lotion.

349
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:36,960
And there's some... chapstick.

350
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,200
<i>Why are you here, blanquita?</i>

351
00:15:43,268 --> 00:15:45,002
I have nothing else to say to you.

352
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,005
S.A.P.D. has charged you
with premeditated murder.

353
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:52,142
And they have plenty of
evidence to support their case.

354
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,015
My training and my instinct

355
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:01,751
tell me that you weren't having
an affair with Justin Bluford.

356
00:16:01,818 --> 00:16:05,254
And I'm hoping that you
come to trust me enough

357
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:06,955
to tell me why you're lying,

358
00:16:07,023 --> 00:16:09,224
and the why of it all

359
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:11,693
that might just keep you off death row.

360
00:16:15,665 --> 00:16:18,567
I knew what I was doing
when I pulled the trigger.

361
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:21,101
If you were angry and wanted revenge,

362
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,137
why didn't you just shoot him?

363
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:27,642
Because he hurts more alive.

364
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:40,820
It's Jason.

365
00:16:40,888 --> 00:16:44,257
You said "Justin" earlier
to see if I would notice.

366
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:45,958
It's Jason.

367
00:16:46,026 --> 00:16:48,528
My mistake.

368
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:08,467
- (Molly) I love this museum.

369

370
00:17:10,337 --> 00:17:11,271
He was one hell of a sheriff.

371
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:13,239
Yes, he was.

372
00:17:13,307 --> 00:17:15,541

- Mm-hmm.

386
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:44,601
You know, some of the

But let me tell you something.

389
00:17:49,341 --> 00:17:53,009
Women are a hell of a lot smarter than men.

390

They'll look you straight in
the eye when they're lyin',

Seducing me for information.

406
00:18:39,188 --> 00:18:41,721

(Chuckles) Yeah. Otherwise we get shot.

416
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:40,610
Mm.

417
00:19:40,678 --> 00:19:43,180
Why were you meeting
with Heather Endelsohn?

418
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:46,782
Uh-huh. So that's what last
night was about after all?

419
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,051
(Singsongy) Same as you.

420
00:19:48,118 --> 00:19:51,220
No. No, I can separate my ambitions.

421
00:19:51,288 --> 00:19:52,321
(Sighs) Mm.

422
00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:54,490
(Grunts) Mm-hmm.

423
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:57,460
I don't think Martina
Alvarez shot an a.D.A.

424
00:19:57,528 --> 00:19:59,395
- Because she was sleeping with the groom.
- No?

425
00:19:59,463 --> 00:20:01,763
And the fact that you were
meeting with the D.A.'s office

426
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,232
tells me that your agency
has an interest in this.

427
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,469
So... tell me what it is.

428
00:20:09,138 --> 00:20:12,274
It's not your jurisdiction.

429
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:18,045
It's a case that I've been
building for two years.

430
00:20:18,113 --> 00:20:21,382
And I am not gonna cross
contaminate it with the Rangers.

431
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,151
Alvarez didn't shoot an
A.D.A. because she was jealous.

432
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:27,188
My bet? The cartel was involved.

433
00:20:27,255 --> 00:20:30,057
So why don't you tell me how
so we can help each other?

434
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,992
Right. So that we can help each other.

435
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,793
Wait. What do I get out of this again?

436
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,195
Federal witness.

437
00:20:35,262 --> 00:20:37,430
Really? 'Cause from where I stand,

438
00:20:37,498 --> 00:20:40,733
the S.A.P.D. has charged a woman with
premeditated murder... (Zips up dress)

439
00:20:40,801 --> 00:20:42,235
And that doesn't relate to the D.E.A.

440
00:20:42,303 --> 00:20:44,504
You know it's related.

441
00:20:44,572 --> 00:20:47,840
Well, then why don't you
get me something to prove it?

442
00:20:49,342 --> 00:20:51,410
Shutting me out is a big mistake,

443
00:20:51,478 --> 00:20:53,778
and I'll prove it.

444
00:20:53,846 --> 00:20:57,249
- I think Alvarez is working for the cartel.
- No.

445
00:20:57,317 --> 00:20:59,284
They hire hit men, not little girls.

446
00:20:59,352 --> 00:21:01,587
Yeah, maybe not this time.

447
00:21:01,654 --> 00:21:03,021
Maybe they chose Alvarez

448
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:06,224
specifically because of
her proximity to the groom.

449
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,026
And then they could sell
this as a crime of passion.

450
00:21:09,094 --> 00:21:11,829
- Well, then why does Alvarez go along with it?
- I don't know.

451
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,932
But whatever it is, it terrifies her.

452
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,934
More than the death penalty?

453
00:21:17,002 --> 00:21:18,102
I don't know why she's so afraid,

454
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,005
but she served her purpose.

455
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,672
S.A.P.D. missed something.

456
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,640
I'm gonna go back to Alvarez's house.

457
00:21:23,707 --> 00:21:25,074
If you're wrong in this...

00:24:24,815 --> 00:24:27,717
across the street from the
gym where you worked downtown.

490
00:24:29,653 --> 00:24:32,055
This month,

491
00:24:32,123 --> 00:24:33,990
she never picked it up.

492
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,429
Now I can't prove it,

493
00:24:40,497 --> 00:24:41,630
but I suspect that they were kidnapped

494
00:24:41,697 --> 00:24:45,100
by the Nuevo Laredo cartel.

495
00:24:45,168 --> 00:24:48,303
Martina, you're not a murderer.

496
00:24:48,371 --> 00:24:52,106
You're just a young woman who's
trying to protect her family.

497
00:24:52,174 --> 00:24:55,609
You think you can dig
deep and find the truth?

498
00:24:55,677 --> 00:24:58,146
You don't know anything.

499
00:24:58,213 --> 00:24:59,980
I was nearly killed because of you.

500
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,186
I spoke to your attorney.

501
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:07,455
I can have you transferred
to a federal prison,

502
00:25:07,523 --> 00:25:09,156
where you will be under protective care.

503
00:25:09,223 --> 00:25:11,258
I don't care what happens to me.

504
00:25:11,325 --> 00:25:14,627
- Martina, I understand how it feels to be trapped...
- No, you don't understand.

505
00:25:14,695 --> 00:25:15,995
That's not true.

506
00:25:16,064 --> 00:25:18,165
<i>You're just a spoiled, beautiful gringa.</i>

507
00:25:18,232 --> 00:25:20,067
I know you're terrified.

508
00:25:20,134 --> 00:25:21,535
I saw it right away in your eyes.

509
00:25:21,602 --> 00:25:24,470
And I know how it feels
to be so desperately afraid

510
00:25:24,538 --> 00:25:27,005
that you make horrible mistakes.

511
00:25:27,074 --> 00:25:30,809
(Breathing deeply)

512
00:25:38,051 --> 00:25:40,452
(Voice breaks) Ten years ago,

513
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:42,687
I married a man

514
00:25:42,754 --> 00:25:45,823
that I thought loved me,

515
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:47,092
deeply.

516
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,129
I was young.

517
00:25:51,197 --> 00:25:52,730
He was... 

518
00:25:57,302 --> 00:25:59,703
(Whispering) he was strong,

519
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:03,039
and I felt protected,

520
00:26:03,108 --> 00:26:05,242
until one day... (Inhales sharply)

521
00:26:09,447 --> 00:26:11,781
he hit me.

522
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:14,317
And then he hit me again

523
00:26:14,384 --> 00:26:15,751
and again.

524
00:26:21,492 --> 00:26:24,994
I've never told anyone the truth,

525
00:26:25,061 --> 00:26:28,563
and maybe I never will,

526
00:26:28,631 --> 00:26:32,267
because I'm ashamed.

527
00:26:32,335 --> 00:26:35,069
I'm ashamed that I didn't have the strength

528
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:38,072
to leave sooner.

529
00:26:38,141 --> 00:26:41,676
But I couldn't.

530
00:26:41,744 --> 00:26:43,911
I felt trapped.

531
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:47,181
But, Martina, I was wrong.

532
00:26:50,252 --> 00:26:53,220
(Photos rustle)

533
00:26:53,288 --> 00:26:56,423
Now I'm not here as your friend.

534
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:58,125
I'm here because you face the death penalty

535
00:26:58,193 --> 00:27:00,460
for a crime you were coerced into doing.

536
00:27:00,528 --> 00:27:05,931
<i>Tell me what happened right
now, and I will find your family.</i>

537
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:09,569
(Voice breaks) How do you
know they're still alive?

538
00:27:09,637 --> 00:27:12,172
I don't.

539
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:14,907
But if they are,

540
00:27:14,975 --> 00:27:18,177
<i>I will find them and
get them out of Mexico.</i>

541
00:27:18,244 --> 00:27:22,581
<i>But you have to tell me
everything that you know now.</i>

542
00:27:25,385 --> 00:27:29,154
<i>(Heartbeat thumping)</i>

543
00:27:29,222 --> 00:27:30,389
<i>(Martina) Two men from the cartel</i>

544
00:27:30,456 --> 00:27:31,490
<i>broke into my house... </i>

545
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:33,090
(Man shouts indistinctly)

546
00:27:33,158 --> 00:27:35,993
<i>And told me they had
kidnapped my little girl... </i>

547
00:27:36,061 --> 00:27:37,595
<i>- (Screaming)
- and my mother.</i>

548
00:27:37,663 --> 00:27:39,330
(Shouts in Spanish)

549
00:27:39,398 --> 00:27:44,468
And the men said they would
kill them if I didn't cooperate.

550
00:27:44,536 --> 00:27:49,239
(Martina and men shouting in Spanish)

551
00:27:49,307 --> 00:27:52,141
(Crying)

552
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:55,745
<i>They gave me a gun and
told me to go to that church</i>

553
00:27:55,813 --> 00:27:58,014
<i>and shoot the bride.</i>

554
00:27:58,082 --> 00:28:02,519
If I did, my mother
and daughter would live.

555
00:28:04,154 --> 00:28:06,322
They took my phone

556
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:10,359
and they called the man.

557
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:12,628
They made me kill that woman.

558
00:28:12,696 --> 00:28:16,131
I had no choice.

559
00:28:21,437 --> 00:28:24,872
Alvarez is willing to testify
against the Nuevo Laredo cartel.

560
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,941
You find that interesting?

561
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,244
I find it suspicious.

562
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:31,646
The cartel kidnapped her mother
and daughter. (Photos rustle)

563
00:28:31,714 --> 00:28:32,913
They used it as leverage

564
00:28:32,981 --> 00:28:34,782
to force Alvarez to kill the A.D.A... 

565
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:37,684
something the cartel doesn't
do unless absolutely necessary.

566
00:28:37,752 --> 00:28:40,587
What did the D.A.'s office have?

567
00:28:40,655 --> 00:28:42,856
(Sighs)

568
00:28:42,923 --> 00:28:44,391
(Lowered voice) Nine months ago,

569
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:46,293
a woman was stabbed to death
in alamo heights by her husband.

570
00:28:46,361 --> 00:28:48,128
He walked.

571
00:28:48,195 --> 00:28:49,763
S.A.P.D. didn't have enough to charge him.

572
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,765
I was working with
Endelsohn to reopen the case.

573
00:28:51,832 --> 00:28:53,198
Why?

574
00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:55,000
So I could use the murder rap to flip him,

575
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:57,202
get him to testify.

576
00:28:57,271 --> 00:29:00,273
He's a big asset to
the Nuevo Laredo cartel.

577
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,040
In what context? Smuggler?

578
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:03,309
No. No, no, no. He's... 

579
00:29:03,377 --> 00:29:04,843
(Bell dings) (Man) Order ready!

580
00:29:07,347 --> 00:29:08,713
- (Man) Pick it up.
- He works for a trucking company.

581
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:10,848
And they use him to
authenticate the paperwork

582
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:14,619
to transport about $40
million in contraband a year.

583
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:16,588
All right, he was worth
protecting, and so they did.

584
00:29:16,656 --> 00:29:20,292
They killed a District Attorney.
The cartel will do anything.

585
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,526
Alvarez won't cooperate

586
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:23,662
unless she sees her
mother and daughter again.

587
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:27,030
- No.
- (Door bell jingles, door closes)

588
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,832
No. There is no way that
I'm risking my informants

589
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,167
on a raid into Mexico

590
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:32,068
for two people who are
probably already dead.

591
00:29:32,136 --> 00:29:34,104
Well, then you don't have a case.

592
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:36,873
You're insane.

593
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,577
(Door bell jingles)

594
00:29:41,645 --> 00:29:43,847
If you help me get these people out,

595
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,882
you have a real shot at
taking down a major ring.

596
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,517
It could be a huge win for you.

597
00:29:48,584 --> 00:29:49,651
Yeah? What do you get?

598
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:51,720
Justice.

599
00:29:51,788 --> 00:29:55,257
(Scoffs) Justice doesn't
motivate me in to Mexico.

600
00:29:55,325 --> 00:29:56,658
- Dan...
- Molly,

601
00:29:56,726 --> 00:29:58,994
I will not risk agency
assets on soft intel.

602
00:29:59,062 --> 00:30:01,063
Period.

603
00:30:01,131 --> 00:30:02,331
There's a good chance

604
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:03,732
Alvarez's mother and
daughter will be killed

605
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,534
because I couldn't let the
case close with S.A.P.D.

606
00:30:06,601 --> 00:30:08,636
I can't forgive myself.

607
00:30:12,441 --> 00:30:14,575
Dan, I'm asking for your help.

608
00:30:22,416 --> 00:30:24,251
We do this, we do it alone.

609
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,787
I'll use one contact.

610
00:30:27,856 --> 00:30:29,589
I understand.

611
00:30:31,425 --> 00:30:33,894
There's an excellent chance
we're gonna die in Mexico.

612
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,072
We're wasting time.

613
00:30:49,885 --> 00:30:51,319
(Man speaks indistinctly) Pull on up.

614
00:30:51,387 --> 00:30:52,854
(Dan) My contacts found them.

615
00:30:52,921 --> 00:30:54,621
They're being held outside a rodeo arena

616
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:56,490
the cartel uses to move drugs.

617
00:30:56,557 --> 00:30:57,891
(Man) I need to see your I.D.

618
00:30:57,959 --> 00:30:59,559
- (Metal clanks)
- (Man) All right, there's two.

619
00:30:59,627 --> 00:31:01,828
(Dan) The plan's to tip the
cartel about a false raid,

620
00:31:01,896 --> 00:31:04,164
force them to move out so we can move in.

621
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:17,877
(Door clanks)

622
00:31:17,944 --> 00:31:20,946
<i>Cartel thinks the federales
are planning a raid.</i>

623
00:31:21,015 --> 00:31:22,448
It's a false set up,

624
00:31:22,516 --> 00:31:25,050
so they move out of the area
where you need to go into.

625
00:31:25,118 --> 00:31:27,419
They'll move the drugs.

626
00:31:27,487 --> 00:31:30,322
You wait for snipers on rooftops

627
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,957
here, here, and here

628
00:31:33,026 --> 00:31:34,326
to head away from the area

629
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:36,094
<i>where abuelita y la niña are being held.</i>

630
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:39,131
(Sighs)

631
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:41,065
Once you see them making a move,

632
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:42,366
you have about 20 minutes

633
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:44,835
before they find out the raid was false.

634
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,771
When they get back,

635
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,540
we better be far away.

636
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:51,442
How long before the raid's tipped?

637
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,145
Three hours.

638
00:32:00,717 --> 00:32:02,519
You really play the trumpet?

639
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:04,187
(Chuckles)

640
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,023
Every Tuesday night at
the Continental Club.

641
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,625
(Cell phone vibrates)

642
00:32:09,693 --> 00:32:12,195
(Vibrates)

643
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,995
<i>Salud.</i>

644
00:32:19,936 --> 00:32:22,871
(Engine idling)

645
00:32:22,939 --> 00:32:25,207
(Tires peal)

646
00:32:25,275 --> 00:32:26,841

(Dogs barking in distance)

648
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,488
(Lowered voice) Go. Go.

649
00:32:40,556 --> 00:32:41,889
