1
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,752
Well, there she is. Tucson.

2
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,251
Tucson ahead!

3
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,954
- Where?
- There.

4
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:21,330
It ain't exactly pretty, is it?

5
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,560
- Protection from Indians.
- Yep.

6
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:26,463
Sure feel good to stretch out in a hotel bed.

7
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:27,938
- Come on.
- What?

8
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,468
Sure is nice to see some peaceful Indians.

9
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,877
Them is Papago.

10
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,645
Hate Apaches worse than I do.

11
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:16,478
Lookee yonder.
The town's growing all the time.

12
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:27,055
Back home they'd have called that
making a house out of mud pies.

13
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,534
What do they do with the hole
when they're done?

14
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,864
Well, they...

15
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,605
Well, just leave it, I reckon.

16
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,750
Lookee yonder.

17
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,379
Too lazy to make their own bricks.

18
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,292
Fellas like them are destroying evidence...

19
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:59,388
of the only walled city
in United States territory.

20
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,530
Old-timers used the wall
for fighting off Indians?

21
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:06,299
Yep. Built when all this belonged to Mexico.

22
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:11,536
Whole town inside the walls,
soldiers guarding it day and night.

23
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:16,146
Well, the way that wall looks now,
I'd say Tucson's bust its britches.

24
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,659
Seems like that water
would make you dirtier.

25
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,133
Stay around here long enough,
you'll wind up drinking it.

26
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,367
I'll take a look at California first.

27
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:51,383
Haircut and shave.
Shave and a haircut. Haircut and shave.

28
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,885
Well, here you are...

29
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,255
the sweetest little city this side of a rat hole.

30
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,088
Camp in the Plaza!

31
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,320
Sure is a tired-looking outfit, Grant.

32
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,921
More restless people.

33
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,929
Where do you say they're from, Pete?

34
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:41,430
Judging by their rigs,
I'd say no further east than Missouri.

35
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:47,766
What's he saying?

36
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,331
He wants to water your horse
in the Plaza for 15 cents.

37
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,399
Why, sure.

38
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,547
He says you are a great man.

39
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,916
My name's Grant Oury. Where you from?

40
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,315
Missouri. Name's Peter Muncie.

41
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,784
You guessed right, Pete.

42
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,321
This is Estevan Ochoa, Pete Kitchen,
and Bart Massey.

43
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,554
- Pleased to know you.
- Howdy.

44
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:08,627
Looks like your outfit
got whittled down some on the trail.

45
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:12,186
Yep, we started out from Missouri
with 45 people and 15 wagons...

46
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:15,799
but the Indians took to pot-shooting.
Couple of brand new orphans in the outfit.

47
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,769
Yeah, that's why there's always legroom
in the West.

48
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,931
Say, what's a good hotel here?

49
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:27,271
Sir, the hotels to be found in Tucson
are neither good nor bad.

50
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:28,673
They are non-existent.

51
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,511
- You mean there ain't one?
- That's right.

52
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,217
What's the trouble, Phoebe?

53
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,181
Who's she?

54
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,484
Phoebe Titus,
the only American woman in Tucson.

55
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,687
Think she's going to need help?

56
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:46,926
Offhand, knowing Phoebe, I'd say no,
but we'd better be sort of handy.

57
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:55,965
Stop that music.

58
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:06,244
Timmins, Longstreet, stand up and reach.

59
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,180
Now, listen.

60
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,657
I've got no quarrel with anybody
but these two here...

61
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,420
so the rest of you better clear out.

62
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,529
These might be in the way.

63
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,399
Much obliged.

64
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:30,606
Some day this town will get tired
of being kicked around by Ward's men.

65
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:33,236
It'll run the whole gang of you out of town.

66
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,137
Till that happens, though...

67
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:38,181
and as long as Ward keeps bragging
there's no law around here...

68
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,841
I'll settle things my own way.

69
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,716
What's ailing you now, Phoebe?

70
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:46,420
These two playmates of yours
stole $1,100 out of my house.

71
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,484
I'm not saying you put them up to it, Ward...

72
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,030
but I'm here to get my money back.
Right now.

73
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,722
What do you say to that?

74
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,235
- Us? We did not.
- We never saw no $1,100 in our whole life.

75
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,736
Then you'll wish you had.

76
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:02,636
'Cause there is going to be two holes dug
in the new cemetery that you'll just fit.

77
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,676
You heard them, Phoebe.
Have you got proof?

78
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,606
Yeah, I heard them.

79
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,778
Now if I don't start seeing my money
I'm going to shoot.

80
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,784
- There'll be no killing in my place.
- Since when? Since this morning?

81
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:16,117
All right, put that money on the table
or get ready to feel lead.

82
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:20,154
You better do what the lady says.

83
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,401
Count it, somebody.

84
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,333
I'd like to oblige.

85
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:34,970
Keep digging, boys.

86
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,640
I'll get this off my chest.

87
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,874
Before I came to Tucson...

88
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,114
I never dreamed a place could stomach
such off-scourings and scum...

89
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,381
as you and your crowd.

90
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,787
You wouldn't say that
without these others backing you up.

91
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,620
I'm talking for myself.

92
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,551
It's not enough that you charge twice
what it's worth to haul freight into here...

93
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,030
but you've collected
the doggonedest bunch of lawbreakers...

94
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,033
in the whole territory of Arizona.

95
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,701
Pardon the interrupting,
but you're $225 short.

96
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,703
Tell your banker to pay back what they lost.

97
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,764
Everybody knows it's stolen money.

98
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,970
All right, Joe.

99
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:17,004
Timmins, take that whip...

100
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:20,141
and give Longstreet
five of the best lashes you got in you.

101
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:22,851
Longstreet...

102
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,116
you do the same to him.

103
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,150
And if either of you eases up, I'll make it 20.

104
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,454
But you got your money back.

105
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,020
Why don't you let us be, Miss Phoebe?
We didn't mean no harm.

106
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,930
- Get started.
- Maybe I got something to say...

107
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,798
about what can be done in my own place.

108
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,893
You better do what the lady says.

109
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,402
Get going.

110
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,276
Ward, you've got an idea
you run this town...

111
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,249
so I'll set you right about one thing.

112
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:55,112
I've got my livestock and a pie business
to take care of.

113
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,913
That don't leave me much time
for chasing thieves.

114
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,485
Keep your men away from my place...

115
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:01,890
or I'll double-load this gun...

116
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,589
and blow a hole in you
they could drive a team of mules through.

117
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,995
- Yeah? Now, listen here...
- Longstreet!

118
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,692
Give him as good as you got.

119
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,062
- Here's your money, miss.
- Thanks.

120
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,503
- My name is...
- Harder!

121
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,307
Just got in to town a few minutes ago.
My name's...

122
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:20,970
That's more like it.

123
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,309
And remember...

124
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,349
I'm still keeping my money in my house.

125
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,017
Thanks, fellas.

126
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,622
Well, do you still wonder
whether she can take care of herself?

127
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,053
Brother, there goes a female army.

128
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,853
And after all that fine talk,
she went and took my hat.

129
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:38,488
Be with you in a minute.

130
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,030
- Trouble, Miss Phoebe?
- No trouble.

131
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,363
We've been waiting. I've got to go to work.

132
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:45,461
Any man that don't think the pies
are worth waiting for is free to leave.

133
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,268
Everything is fine.
I watch pies all the time you're gone.

134
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,534
Thanks, Hilario.

135
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:52,338
There will be a special pie for you
in the next batch.

136
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:55,538
Sorry to keep you waiting,
but I had a little business to take care of.

137
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,343
Got a peach today?

138
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,948
Yep, I got a peach right here.

139
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,280
Mind the heat.

140
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,521
Can I get one of them?

141
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,425
You sure can.

142
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,127
Take your pick, as soon as I see your dollar.

143
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,434
It's the last one, quince.

144
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,434
Much obliged, but I come to get my hat.

145
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,802
Oh, it was you.

146
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:31,141
Doggoned if I didn't walk right off with it.
Be right back.

147
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,685
Say, I never seed a woman pay less
attention to me than you did in that saloon.

148
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,884
Well, I had plenty on my mind.

149
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,487
You're new here.

150
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,494
Got in a little while ago.

151
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:48,198
Help yourself to some pie. Come on in.

152
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:02,039
How come you got yourself
into my argument over at the saloon?

153
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,641
Well, where I'm from,
women is supposed to need protection.

154
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,551
I'm obliged
for the use of your hat, stranger...

155
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,150
but I don't ask nor get favors
for being what I was born.

156
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,956
Yep, that's what I found out.

157
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,295
Where you from?

158
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:21,989
Freeport, Illinois.

159
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:23,894
I'm from Saint Louis.

160
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,101
What brought you here?

161
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,441
My father and I were going to California.

162
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,869
We got this far and he died.

163
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,378
I see how it is.

164
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,978
Living alone in a place like this,
you couldn't afford to be a woman...

165
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,776
unless you met the right man.

166
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:46,988
Eat your pie.

167
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,630
Anything left out of that last batch,
Miss Phoebe?

168
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,906
They are all sold, Judge.

169
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:09,277
- How long before the next batch?
- Maybe an hour.

170
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,082
Seems as though
a newly elected justice of the peace...

171
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,122
ought to have some special rights.

172
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:18,921
Who elected you?

173
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,720
Oh, some of the boys.

174
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,427
Hey, Joe Briggs.

175
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:29,165
I got some time on my hands, Joe,
and there's a charge against you.

176
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,637
Might as well hold court out here
where it don't smell so bad.

177
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,930
Are you ready to stand trial?

178
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,904
I ain't got much time. Can you hurry it up?

179
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,035
Sure enough.

180
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,502
Just step in a little more where it's shady.

181
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,652
Now, prisoner at the bar,
the charge against you is...

182
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,213
that you up and blowed the head
plumb off of Gus Modesto...

183
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:56,657
in consequence of which said shooting,
said Gus is deader than blazes.

184
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,594
Are you guilty or not guilty?

185
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,197
No, Judge, I don't reckon
I can say not guilty...

186
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,925
when everybody seed me do it.

187
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,398
Now, what in tunket made you
act like that, Joe?

188
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,169
Drinking. Just drinking.

189
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,733
Well, the verdict of this here tribunal is...

190
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,540
that Joe Briggs is fined $5...

191
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,137
for disturbing the peace.

192
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,608
Court is hereby adjourned...

193
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:21,278
to Lazarus Ward's bar,
where said fine will be duly disposed of.

194
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:25,021
Some day, Judge Bogardus,
the law will come to Arizona...

195
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,182
and half of you will be hung.

196
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,626
Miss Phoebe, you belittle us. Not half, 90%.

197
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,094
Maybe the government forgot us now...

198
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,132
arguing about what should be free
and what slave...

199
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,564
but the time will come...

200
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,102
and when it does,
this will be a territory to be proud of.

201
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,502
Quite right. Quite right.
A territory to be proud of.

202
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,576
Meanwhile, Mr. Briggs,
there is a fine to be paid.

203
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,711
Any of you gentlemen that feel up to it
may participate in the first round.

204
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,942
I mean any one of you gentlemen.

205
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,280
You got the $5, ain't you, Joe?

206
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,121
Mighty nice talk you give.

207
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,287
Probably won't do much good, though.

208
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,727
Somebody has to tell them off,
whether it helps or not.

209
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,764
You're sure doing a man's work
around this town, ain't you?

210
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,061
I keep busy.

211
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,372
Do you wear them jeans all the time?

212
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:18,701
Why?

213
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:21,302
Well, I packed a banjo
all the way from Saint Louis.

214
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:24,411
Thought I might serenade you tonight,
if you'd put on a dress.

215
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,015
You'll serenade me the way I am.

216
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,216
I mean...

217
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,918
I'll be busy tonight.

218
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,715
Music's for idlers anyway.

219
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,622
Thanks for the pie.

220
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,787
Keep the oven hot.

221
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,228
I don't want any serenading, now.

222
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,667
No serenading.

223
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,347
Haircut? Shave?

224
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,751
I could use a shave.

225
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:04,586
Fix you up in a jiffy.

226
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,290
You play a nice fiddle. I got a banjo.

227
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:08,585
Finest fiddle in the West.

228
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,754
I packed her 1,500 miles.
She never done bust a string.

229
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,688
Say, does Miss Phoebe Titus
live at her pie stand?

230
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,494
Yes, sir. Fine girl, Miss Phoebe.

231
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,327
Figuring on doing a little courting?

232
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,565
Maybe.

233
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,764
Let's fix you up sweet then.

234
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,507
Good close shave.

235
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,507
Some vanilla extract on your hair.

236
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,675
Yes, sir! Plenty of vanilla.

237
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,540
Don't shave me too short.

238
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,361
Who is that?
Do you want I should send him away?

239
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,188
Go on back to bed.

240
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:22,424
Can't you hear? I'm being serenaded.

241
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,134
- Was it good?
- I don't know.

242
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,066
I guess so, I've never been sung to before.

243
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,672
You look kind of pretty standing there.

244
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,372
Lots different than you did in that saloon.

245
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,748
I suppose it would please you more...

246
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,183
if I'd walk around town all day
in my nightshirt.

247
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:18,352
I think I could get used to them britches
if I stayed around long enough.

248
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,224
You figuring on leaving?

249
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,587
Sometime.

250
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,933
This Arizona Territory is worth looking into
for a man with ideas.

251
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,761
Maybe if you studied it some
you'd decide to stay.

252
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:36,164
Might be I'd settle down,
if I could get a job to suit me.

253
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,905
You mean one with something doing
all the time, to keep you on the move?

254
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:40,967
Yeah.

255
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,837
Say, how did you know that about me?

256
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:48,186
The way you go poking
into other people's troubles.

257
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,853
The way you talk.
The way you wear your hat.

258
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,350
Well, you sort of took an interest in me.

259
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:55,815
Yeah.

260
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,530
Arizona could use fellas like you right now.

261
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,098
Maybe something will turn up.

262
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,333
You sure are a calculating woman.

263
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,073
I wouldn't say what I said...

264
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,370
if I didn't like you some.

265
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,844
Much obliged.

266
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,639
Same to you.

267
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,018
Play some more music.

268
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,058
- Fancy or courting?
- Just music.

269
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:45,765
Howdy, Johnny.

270
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,004
Howdy, Miss Phoebe.

271
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,671
- Morning, Solomon.
- Sorry I missed the commotion yesterday.

272
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,046
It wasn't much.

273
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:57,712
Need some needles and another sack
of flour for those gol-darned pies.

274
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,417
Those gol-darned pies
are making you a good living.

275
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,888
Better ways than that to get ahead.

276
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,152
How much are your needles?

277
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,457
Quarter apiece.

278
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,461
25 cents?

279
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,528
Why, you old Scotchman.

280
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,696
What do you have to do,
find them in a haystack?

281
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,673
Well, you know
the cost of hauling over land.

282
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:21,145
Especially when freighting men like Ward
charge us twice what it's worth.

283
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,008
What about Ochoa?
He's bringing in goods at fair prices.

284
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,073
Well, he can't supply everybody.

285
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,648
There's a business for you. Freighting.

286
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,453
Plenty of room for another honest outfit.

287
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:34,992
Yeah, I reckon so.
Well, how many needles you want?

288
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,488
Two's plenty.

289
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:40,190
Johnny, take a sack of flour
over to Miss Phoebe's right away.

290
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,700
Wagons, oxen, mules...

291
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:48,165
and plenty of good strong men
that aren't afraid of hard work.

292
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:49,971
Also Indians.

293
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,407
That's part of living here.

294
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,902
I own a wagon
that's fit to haul anything anywhere...

295
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,342
four horses...

296
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:59,111
and I got enough money
to buy oxen and another wagon.

297
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:03,818
Solomon, I wouldn't be surprised
to see myself in the freighting business.

298
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:07,547
Why, I thought you was aiming to own
the biggest cattle ranch in Arizona.

299
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:11,060
That's right, and here's a better way
of getting it than selling pies.

300
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,426
You're forgetting you'd be bucking up
against Lazarus Ward.

301
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,935
- He don't like to play.
- Ochoa's doing all right against him.

302
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:20,803
Two wagons.

303
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:26,135
You'd always have to be waiting
for somebody else's train to set out...

304
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:28,202
so as you could join for protection.

305
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,515
Four wagons would do the trick.

306
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:33,243
Four wagons could travel alone.

307
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,910
I'll get along with two.

308
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:36,747
Phoebe...

309
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,253
you and me think lots alike.

310
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,952
We both got confidence
this country's going to grow.

311
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:47,254
Now, I didn't drive no mule teams
across here...

312
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:48,625
with every cent I had...

313
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,101
without figuring that more people are
going to be coming here all the time.

314
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,396
Being the man
who opened the first store in Tucson...

315
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,270
you ought to know
which way the wind's blowing.

316
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,502
Phoebe, it looks like
you got yourself a partner.

317
00:22:58,643 --> 00:22:59,667
Shake.

318
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:03,579
Now, I'll put up money enough for
two more wagons and some oxen. Then...

319
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,783
Say, where are we going to find
a good man...

320
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:08,979
to head the outfit on the trail?

321
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,022
- They're darn scarce.
- Yeah.

322
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:14,122
Leave it to me. I'll get him.

323
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,032
See you later, partner.

324
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:25,425
Got all day.

325
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,568
Good morning, Mr. Muncie.

326
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,003
Good morning.

327
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,835
I was hoping to buy a pie for breakfast,
but you was out.

328
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,571
- Hello, Phoebe.
- Howdy.

329
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,977
There's something that might be worth
talking about, Mr. Muncie.

330
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,038
Yes, ma'am.

331
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,877
Do you mind going someplace
where it's not quite so noisy?

332
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,113
Wherever you say.

333
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:44,950
Somebody rob you again?

334
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,148
No.

335
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,185
I've been thinking about something
for quite a spell.

336
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,728
I just settled it.

337
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,724
You seem mighty pleased.

338
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:55,264
Remember that job
you were talking about last night...

339
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,164
the one with something doing all the time?

340
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,164
Well, it's waiting for you, right now.

341
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:01,498
What's that?

342
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,901
Heading a freighting outfit
on the trail for me.

343
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,169
For you?

344
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:08,738
Solomon Warner is my partner.
He runs the big store here.

345
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:13,343
Maybe I'm taking a long chance
deciding you're the man for the job.

346
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,311
But I'm a pretty good judge of people.

347
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,217
Well, what do you say?

348
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,353
Miss Phoebe...

349
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,423
I'm going to tell you something
I'm afraid you won't understand.

350
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,490
What's that?

351
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,995
There's a wagon train come in headed
for California and I'm joining up with it.

352
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:36,633
When?

353
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,273
Sundown.

354
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,874
Well, sundown's a good time to leave.

355
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,913
Indians don't hanker much
for night fighting.

356
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:49,980
But why in tarnation
do you want to go to California?

357
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,120
I better not tell you.

358
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,886
I'm asking you, why?

359
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,654
All right...

360
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,322
I'm going to California
because I want to see it.

361
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,393
Well, I'll be doggoned!

362
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,198
I figure it sounds kind of crazy...

363
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,431
to most people...

364
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,337
going to California just to see it.

365
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,502
But there's a gallivanting bug in my blood...

366
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,409
and that's the way I am.

367
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:18,077
Here I am offering you just the kind of job
you said you wanted...

368
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:21,810
and you talk about traveling 700 miles
to go sightseeing.

369
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,677
Well, it ain't that I don't want to work.

370
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,614
There's something I got to do first.

371
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:29,788
What can you do in California
you can't do here?

372
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,593
Lie down under a shade tree.

373
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,165
Well, run me ragged.

374
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:43,566
I'll be heading back this way, though,
when that gallivanting fever goes out of me.

375
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,776
Because I'm sort of fond of you.

376
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:50,414
It doesn't matter to me
whether you come back or not.

377
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,281
Now, listen, don't act like that.

378
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,715
We both know we're partial to each other.

379
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,246
And the best thing I can do is...

380
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,881
get the wandering done
while it won't do no harm.

381
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,185
Will you be watching
when we leave tonight?

382
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,160
I don't know. Maybe, maybe not.

383
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,594
There's only one more thing to be said.

384
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,764
When I come back this way,
it will probably be to settle down for good...

385
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:15,604
and I'll be looking for you.

386
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,838
We're leaving from the Plaza.

387
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,313
Well, I'll be dogged.

388
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,483
Remember the name, Peter Muncie.

389
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,463
Come back, Peter Muncie.

390
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,613
Phoebe...

391
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:40,385
there's crazy talk around town
you're going into the freighting business.

392
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,753
There is nothing crazy about it.

393
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:43,951
Ward...

394
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:47,897
some day Warner and I'll have a train that'll
make yours look like a lop-wheeled shay.

395
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,393
And people will be getting their goods
at fair prices.

396
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:51,594
Maybe.

397
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:54,465
And maybe some day when you're running
the freighting business...

398
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,336
I'll be baking pretty pies.

399
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:00,744
You got a lot to learn, Phoebe.

400
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:26,397
Turn off to the feed store
and start unloading.

401
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:29,539
- Terry!
- Yes, ma'am.

402
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:31,268
The next two go to Warner's.

403
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,677
You two go to Warner's.

404
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:39,478
I got four barrels of salt fish for you,
Sam, the best you can get.

405
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,519
- Fine. You're back early.
- Yeah.

406
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,146
- Terry.
- Yes, ma'am.

407
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,713
Take care of Meyer's and the restaurant.

408
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,760
Have Steve unload at Hughes
and send the last wagon over to my place.

409
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,227
Yes, Miss Phoebe.

410
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,031
You see that, Ward?

411
00:28:57,102 --> 00:29:01,698
Eight wagons top-heavy with freight.
You'd better start baking those pies.

412
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:07,144
Phoebe freighting
and telling you to bake pies.

413
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:11,739
That sure would be comical,
you baking pies.

414
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,183
Yeah, wouldn't it?

415
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,120
Two days early. Phoebe, you're a wonder.

416
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:23,760
No Indian trouble?

417
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:25,455
We had a little brush with 10 Apaches...

418
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,124
but they hightailed it
before we could fire our second shots.

419
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,527
Sol...

420
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,466
I got a real buy in Yuma.

421
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:34,398
Eight of the fanciest cast-iron stoves
you ever saw.

422
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,132
- Cast-iron stoves!
- Yeah.

423
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,369
Phoebe, where in tarnation
can we sell eight stoves?

424
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:41,775
There'll be women coming in here...

425
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:44,178
and women from the East
want to do their cooking in the house.

426
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,816
In the next five years,
I'll bet you sell 100 stoves.

427
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,853
I'll live to be 90
and won't even sell two stoves.

428
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,784
Well, what else did you get I didn't order?

429
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,723
Oh, fancy bolt cloth, needles...

430
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,756
Needles you can sell for five cents apiece.

431
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:58,960
Phoebe, you're a caution.

432
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:02,828
Sol, we're going to make more money
than we ever dreamed of, and honest.

433
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:04,628
And remember this.

434
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,066
Soon as I get enough for my ranch...

435
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,196
I'm going to turn this whole business
over to you...

436
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,442
and I'm going to settle down
to raise cattle and a family.

437
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,236
You need a husband for that.

438
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,203
I know where I can get one.

439
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,407
Things are coming our way fast, aren't they?
Faster than we ever hoped.

440
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,476
Well, that's usually the time
to start pulling in your belt.

441
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,351
You talk like an old squaw.

442
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:28,484
Yes, sir, things are breaking
just the way I want them.

443
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,491
Say, what day of the month is this?

444
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,086
12th. April 12th.

445
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,585
Message from Maj. Gen. Lynde, sir.

446
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,147
At ease.

447
00:30:58,223 --> 00:30:59,315
Go to the mess hall.

448
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:02,825
Tell them my orders are that you are to have
anything you want to eat and drink.

449
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,885
Thank you, sir.

450
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,793
- It. Chapin.
- Yes, sir.

451
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,195
Well, here it is. War.

452
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:16,262
Our orders are to abandon
and destroy our post...

453
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,832
to burn everything between
the Colorado and the Rio Grande...

454
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,468
that might be food for the rebels.

455
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,376
"March out with your guns loaded...

456
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:25,610
"and do not permit any citizen
within three miles of your lines."

457
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:45,132
There they go...

458
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:49,903
the only law and order and protection
we have known in the Arizona Territory.

459
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:55,673
Who could believe that we would be
cast aside by our own government?

460
00:31:56,881 --> 00:32:00,044
That wanton acts of destruction
are being committed by soldiers...

461
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,176
to whom we look for security.

462
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,284
At this very moment, gentlemen...

463
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:08,689
we are being officially abandoned by
the Army of the United States of America.

464
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:14,823
What grand reward for those of us
who raised that flag in childish loyalty.

465
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,532
Grain fields are being destroyed...

466
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:21,765
livestock butchered...

467
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:23,840
and by these traitorous acts...

468
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:26,638
the government has demonstrated
that it considers us...

469
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:30,272
its own citizens, enemies, unworthy to live.

470
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,781
- You're right.
- Yes.

471
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,685
Well, what are we going to do about it?

472
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:39,245
Stay here and be massacred
by the Apaches...

473
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:41,588
in a hopeless struggle
to save what we have built?

474
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:43,524
No!

475
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,158
Mr. Oury...

476
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:47,898
am I hearing right?

477
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,862
Are you talking about giving Arizona
back to the Indians?

478
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:52,766
That's one way of saying it, Phoebe.

479
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:53,893
Like Oury says...

480
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:57,738
it's better to leave what we built here than
get our bones picked clean by buzzards.

481
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,275
What did you ever build?

482
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,480
Help me up there, Grant.

483
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:07,514
Men...

484
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,049
I know this hits all of us pretty hard.

485
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:14,753
We all sort of figured the Union troops
might have to leave us...

486
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,484
to fight in the war back east.

487
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:18,920
But we didn't want to think about it.

488
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,098
So now it's happened.

489
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:26,264
And the first thing you do
is start hollering uncle.

490
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,166
Why do you want to quit now?

491
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:32,069
Miss Phoebe, I'd follow you head-on
into a barreled cactus...

492
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:34,509
but there's some shenanigans
that oughtn't to be did...

493
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,304
like staying on here for one thing.

494
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:39,316
Terry's right. We'd be fools
to stay around here with the Army gone.

495
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:40,681
I'm leaving tonight!

496
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:54,360
Gentlemen, may I have your attention.

497
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:57,624
Gentlemen, a little courtesy, please.

498
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:02,067
If you please, gentlemen, if you please.

499
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:05,709
Thank you very much.

500
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:08,945
I'd say, gentlemen...

501
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:11,615
that this lady has made you look...

502
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,448
like a bunch of mice.

503
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:23,159
Who are you to have an opinion?

504
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:24,826
Jefferson Carteret.

505
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:28,264
You're quite fortunate
that I just arrived by stage...

506
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:33,198
because it's obvious that this town
could use a little backbone right now.

507
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,663
Much obliged, Mr. Carteret.

508
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,406
Men...

509
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:41,604
we didn't come to Arizona
for peace and quiet.

510
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:46,543
We came here because it's in our blood
to be where there's a hard life to be lived.

511
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,681
We've always been that way.

512
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,980
Why do you want to run out
because the government has quit?

513
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,556
- I'm staying, Phoebe.
- Here, here.

514
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,493
I was never leaving.

515
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,495
I wasn't worried about you men...

516
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,962
but what about all the rest of you out there?

517
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,498
Who's staying?

518
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,699
All right, Miss Phoebe, consider me swayed
by the will of the people.

519
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,463
Next election we have,
you'll be swayed plenty.

520
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:14,909
We'll stay, won't we?

521
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:18,345
Sure, we'll all stay,
and we'll get soldiers here to protect us.

522
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,108
The Union don't want us,
but there's somebody does.

523
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:25,115
Jeff Davis and
the Confederate States of America.

524
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,858
How about it?
How about right here and now...

525
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:35,864
Arizona declaring its allegiance
to the flag of the South?

526
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,033
I'm for it.

527
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,162
At least we'll be treated like human beings.

528
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:50,703
I don't care who we declare for
so long as there's an Arizona Territory.

529
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:52,305
Are we staying?

530
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:53,816
Yeah!

531
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:56,513
That's what I wanted to hear. Come on, Sol.

532
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,817
Let's have a cheer for Jeff Davis.

533
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,524
For the Confederates.

534
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:05,987
For the flag of the South.

535
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,394
Well, I guess they have a right to do that...

536
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:42,491
when the North's run off
with the only flag we know.

537
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,435
The Union can't be blamed, Phoebe.

538
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,302
Using soldiers to hold the country together
is more important...

539
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,399
than just watching over
a few venturesome souls in Arizona.

540
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:55,309
I'm not blaming anybody
but it gets my dander up...

541
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:58,280
to see how a doggoned war
can mess up the plans of people...

542
00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:59,680
who want to mind their own business.

543
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:02,014
- Well, there's troubled times ahead.
- Yeah.

544
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,220
Wars don't last forever.

545
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:07,551
We'll have to work twice as hard
and think twice as fast.

546
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,319
Lots of us are staying here...

547
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:13,793
but later on, there's going to be plenty
that's decided to pull out for safer country.

548
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:14,888
Let them.

549
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:17,767
And I'll buy their land
with every dollar I've got.

550
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,027
When good times come back...

551
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:21,162
I'll have a ranch
you can't ride across in two days.

552
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:23,837
Sol, this is a territory to invest in
for the future.

553
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,136
I never said it ain't.

554
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,675
We're going to have our hands full
getting freight through.

555
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,905
Freighting?

556
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:33,344
Phoebe, do you know that
even stagecoaches won't run after today?

557
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,816
People got to have food just the same...

558
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,944
and things to wear,
and we're going to bring them in.

559
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:41,082
We ain't hauling a pound of freight till
I decide there's a chance to get through...

560
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:43,353
or till there's soldiers again in this territory.

561
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,725
- I say we are!
- I say we ain't!

562
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:49,490
Phoebe, don't you understand?
It's not that I'm afraid.

563
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,728
I never ran away from a fight yet.

564
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,565
But now is the time to sit tight...

565
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,105
until we see what's going to happen.

566
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:57,936
I know how you feel, Sol,
but I don't think that way.

567
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:01,443
I'm starting tomorrow night
for Fort Yuma with all our wagons...

568
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,274
and I'm bringing them back loaded.

569
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:05,147
Are we still partners?

570
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,507
No, Phoebe...

571
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:09,916
I'll have nothing to do
with sending drivers to be murdered.

572
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:14,513
Suit yourself, Sol.
Can I use your share of the outfit?

573
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,390
Thanks.

574
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,059
No hard feelings?

575
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:20,721
Of course not.

576
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,028
It'll be what I haul
that'll keep your store open.

577
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,457
Who asked you in my office?

578
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:51,518
- Office?
- No man comes in here unless I want him to.

579
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:54,362
And no man stays in Tucson
if I don't like him.

580
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:57,731
I'm here and I'm staying in Tucson.

581
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:01,765
Sit down.

582
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:06,876
I know all about you, Ward.

583
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,709
Yeah?

584
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,748
- Where are you from?
- Poor but honest parents.

585
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:13,177
- Is that a joke?
- You're the joke.

586
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,444
- Listen here!
- You listen.

587
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:17,184
My name's Jefferson Carteret.

588
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,882
I heard you in the Plaza.
You and your smart talk...

589
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:21,185
Anybody with sense would know...

590
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:24,159
the Confederates can't spare
enough soldiers to handle this territory.

591
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:27,459
Why, in two months the Indians'll have us
barricaded in and starving to death.

592
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,930
You have a freighting business.

593
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:32,531
Right now there's a fortune to be made
and you're stealing pennies.

594
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,036
- I was doing all right.
- All right.

595
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:35,902
But now with nobody
to keep the Indians in line...

596
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:37,372
Get them on your side.

597
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:39,603
How many guns can you lay your hands on?

598
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,838
- Why?
- I said how many guns?

599
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:46,078
There's eight cases of Sharps rifles
I'm supposed to haul to Tubac.

600
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,310
- Ammunition?
- Yeah.

601
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,046
Who's the head Indian around here?

602
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,812
- Mano.
- How can we talk to him?

603
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,954
You're crazy.

604
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:54,984
You mean make a deal with Mano?

605
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,390
- The soldiers are gone, aren't they?
- Yeah, but you...

606
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:59,827
This country is wide open
for the Indians, isn't it?

607
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:03,060
Well, what do the Indians need most?
Guns and ammunition.

608
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,601
To blow our heads off?

609
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:06,701
Not our heads.

610
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:10,432
We'll supply the guns and ammunition
on condition...

611
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,608
that Mano doesn't bother
our freighting wagons.

612
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,311
Our wagons?

613
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:17,606
From now on, I'm your silent partner.

614
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:19,740
And, Ward, you needed one badly...

615
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:23,981
- because you're just a downright idiot.
- Nobody can say that about me.

616
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,484
I said it.

617
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:28,981
Why?

618
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,192
That woman who spoke in the Plaza,
Phoebe Titus.

619
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,028
What were you doing
while she built up that freighting outfit?

620
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:41,667
I done everything a man could.

621
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,338
It's all so simple.

622
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:47,175
Hire her good drivers away from her
and from anyone else in the business.

623
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:49,140
Pay big wages that no one else can meet...

624
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:51,078
and add it on to the cost of hauling.

625
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:54,416
Yeah, I can do that. That's good, ain't it?

626
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,483
I'll show you how to run this town.

627
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:00,021
Get word to Mano that you want to make
a treaty with him, and do it right away.

628
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,751
- Now look here, you...
- I'm talking.

629
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,727
And get those guns and ammunition
loaded onto a wagon.

630
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,233
And remember this...

631
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:14,233
As far as the people of Tucson
are concerned...

632
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:19,070
I despise you just as much
as does any other decent citizen.

633
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,511
Never speak to me in public.

634
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:24,475
- Never mention our partnership.
- I don't care who you are.

635
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,846
You ain't going to come here
and start ordering me around.

636
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:29,750
- My freighting business belongs to me.
- I don't play, Ward.

637
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:33,717
Either you take me into partnership
or I'll run everything alone.

638
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:36,817
And you won't be around.

639
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:48,928
80 guns...

640
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:52,867
and 16,000 rounds of linen cartridges...

641
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,669
down there in the wagon, and more later.

642
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:04,421
Here's the mark we'll use on our wagons,
a black cross.

643
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,423
Those are the only wagons you let through.

644
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:18,230
What you do, not make treaty...

645
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:21,097
but take guns away, kill you?

646
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:27,774
I come to Mano
knowing of his great name and honor.

647
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,579
Yeah, me, too.

648
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:42,754
Give me your guns,
I let your wagons go through.

649
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:45,188
Well, good.

650
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:47,826
- Thank you, Chief.
- Yeah, that's fine.

651
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:03,503
You're the only real teamster
we've got, Terry.

652
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,550
- Keep those wagons in line ahead of you.
- I'll do my best.

653
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,784
- Well, did you get to Mano?
- Yep.

654
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:13,220
That wagon train
will never get a mile out of town.

655
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:14,279
What did you tell him?

656
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,622
Like you said,
that they wasn't only going for supplies...

657
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:18,525
but to get soldiers from Fort Yuma.

658
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:26,870
Ward, what happens tonight
will throw the whole freighting business...

659
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,098
- right into our laps.
- Yes, sir.

660
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:33,168
This territory is too important
to be abandoned for long.

661
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:35,373
It's the link with the Far West.

662
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:40,244
Whoever controls it will have a big job
on his hands, and a big reward.

663
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:43,520
- That's me, huh?
- Yes, officially that's you.

664
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,513
Stupid.

665
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,053
- I heared you.
- Oh, all right.

666
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:49,419
You "heared" me.

667
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:53,087
And don't follow me.

668
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:03,399
- Phoebe!
- Yes, Sol?

669
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:08,809
I know what I said yesterday was right
about this being crazy...

670
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:11,575
but I sure am sorry
you wouldn't let me join up.

671
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:15,412
I know that, Sol, but you belong here to
keep this town running till we get back.

672
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:17,480
Be praying for you.

673
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,214
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

674
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,259
Don't let them leave while I'm gone.

675
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,022
Take care of yourself.

676
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,933
Indians! Indians!
The Indians are coming! Indians!

677
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:08,394
Warner, Indians are attacking
Phoebe's wagon train.

678
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:36,224
Hang on to them, Ed.

679
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:12,653
Have the Indians attacked
so close to town before?

680
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:15,355
It's those troops leaving.

681
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,785
- You all right, Phoebe?
- Yeah.

682
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:46,119
Well, I asked them to stay.

683
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:50,999
Now it looks like they'll never be able
to leave, let alone get in supplies.

684
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:54,437
All I can say is I didn't know
how bad things were going to be.

685
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:57,029
This would have happened
to those who were going yesterday.

686
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:59,302
- You're not to blame.
- Of course not.

687
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:02,344
And we'll get supplies somehow.

688
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,111
Sure we will, and I'm still glad I'm here.

689
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:13,316
Doggone it, I wish a certain fella
would quit playing his banjo in California.

690
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:56,864
Union soldiers are coming.
Hundreds of them! Much more on their way!

691
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,265
- Union soldiers?
- Yep.

692
00:48:58,335 --> 00:48:59,597
Union soldiers are coming.

693
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:02,501
- Are they going to stay here?
- What do you think they'll do to us?

694
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:05,030
- This is Confederate territory.
- It ain't no more.

695
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:08,805
- Not with the Union soldiers moving in.
- You know what we'll be? Prisoners of war.

696
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:11,473
They'll take our property away from us
and drive us out of Arizona.

697
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:12,572
No, they won't.

698
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:14,879
Can't blame us for being deserted
by the government now.

699
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,113
I'm for being back in the Union
no matter what happens.

700
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:21,556
We belong to the United States again
and I'm telling the world I'm doggone glad.

701
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,822
Let the soldiers know how we feel.
Give them a real greeting.

702
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,181
Hey, there's Sol. Hi, Sol!

703
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:29,824
Ain't this something to holler about?

704
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:35,956
Hiya, fellas.

705
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,830
Hi, Phoebe. Look what we met.

706
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:40,870
- Where are they from?
- Advance guard, California Column.

707
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:42,330
California?

708
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:44,374
- Say, I wonder if...
- Yeah, he's here.

709
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:55,811
Hey, Miss Phoebe.

710
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:02,821
Well, soldier, did you see California?

711
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,453
Yep, heard there was trouble out here.
Glad to see us?

712
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:07,497
That flag sure seems homelike.

713
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,054
Still baking them pies?

714
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:10,531
Maybe, for a hungry man.

715
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,067
You better start making tracks for home...

716
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:14,399
'cause soon as I can figure
to get leave from this Army...

717
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:16,632
- you're going to have a visitor.
- There'll be a pie.

718
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:21,275
What do we do now?

719
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,224
Put it on the table over there.

720
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:42,359
Now you stay out of here
unless I call you, see?

721
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,945
Well, I'll be dogged.

722
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:00,877
What's ailing you?

723
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:04,680
Phoebe, you know, this is the first time
I ever seen you in a dress?

724
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:06,278
Any complaints?

725
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,620
Just like I always figured.
You sure are pretty.

726
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:15,322
Nobody could look pretty
feeling as silly as I do.

727
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,666
Well, there's a dinner on the table.
You claim to be a man...

728
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:22,602
let's see what you can do to it.

729
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,368
Well, I'll be dogged.

730
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:30,706
Turkey?

731
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,543
Who shot it for you?

732
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:35,551
Who do you think? I tailed it for two hours.

733
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,513
Pie, turkey...

734
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:42,651
Phoebe, you sure are pretty.

735
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,368
There ain't been a dinner like that
in or near me in a long spell.

736
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:56,337
Not even in California.

737
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,338
You aren't much of a hand
to talk while you eat, are you?

738
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:01,535
Meals like that don't come often.

739
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:08,245
A lot happened to Arizona since you left.

740
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:11,116
Those soldiers sure are welcome.

741
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,850
I enlisted in California
soon as I heard about it.

742
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:17,022
I'm ready to settle down now.

743
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:19,493
That gallivanting fever is gone for good.

744
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:23,593
Well, you're in the Army, Sergeant.
You'll go where they tell you.

745
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:27,103
My enlistment is up soon.
Maybe I can get free even before then.

746
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:29,871
Is that job still open?

747
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:36,171
The stock could use some water.

748
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,452
I asked you a question.

749
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:46,545
I know you did.

750
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:48,957
I'm thinking.

751
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:55,322
A man named Jefferson Carteret
came here after you left.

752
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:57,727
He helped to hold this town together...

753
00:53:57,801 --> 00:54:00,326
when it looked like
there wasn't going to be any more town.

754
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:03,495
You mean you took a fancy to him?

755
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:06,469
I didn't say that.

756
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:10,474
I'm just sizing you up by comparing you.

757
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:16,146
Carteret wasn't jigging around California
when I needed help.

758
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:19,916
Didn't go looking for a shade tree
when the rumpus started.

759
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:22,647
I knew you'd never understand that.

760
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:26,690
I understood, all right.

761
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:29,121
But I'm different now.

762
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:30,427
Are you?

763
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:33,993
A year ago you went away,
said, "See you soon."

764
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:37,565
Now you're back saying,
"Grab me while I'm here."

765
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:40,102
What's different?

766
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:48,383
Maybe I don't stand up so good
when you start comparing.

767
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,716
I wish there was some way
to show you how I am now.

768
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:54,887
There is.

769
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:57,420
Tell me. All I want is a chance.

770
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,994
When will the Colonel be here
with the main body of troops?

771
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:03,598
A couple of weeks. Why?

772
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:07,669
I'm going to have the best ranch in Arizona.

773
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,569
But it takes money to get started.

774
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,599
I want you to go to the Colonel
and get me an Army freighting contract.

775
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:15,972
Is that all?

776
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:18,776
Just walk up to the Colonel
and make him sign a contract.

777
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:23,285
It can be done, for instance, by a man
who wants to prove how good he is.

778
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:28,483
Why don't you ask me something easy like
walking on water with a horse on my back.

779
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:31,150
You asked for a chance, there it is.

780
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:33,218
Good evening, Miss Phoebe.

781
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:36,094
Oh, Mr. Carteret, good evening.
How are you?

782
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,155
I'm well, thank you.

783
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:40,259
I was just passing by
and stopped to pay my compliments.

784
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,438
But I didn't know you had company.

785
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:43,971
You know now.

786
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:47,903
Mr. Carteret, this is Sgt. Muncie.

787
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:53,478
Peter, that's no way to be.

788
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:55,474
I'm being the way I want.

789
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:58,544
And this what's-his-name
don't fit into my idea of a pleasant evening.

790
00:55:58,655 --> 00:55:59,849
Mr. Muncie!

791
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:02,414
I'll consider the source, Miss Phoebe.

792
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:07,288
Meanwhile, I hope to see you soon,
without the gentleman in the Union suit.

793
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,726
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

794
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:15,560
So that's what you've been
comparing me with.

795
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:19,072
Insulting respectable people
in Arizona isn't good for your health.

796
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:20,632
I don't like him.

797
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,708
How do you know?
You never met him before.

798
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:24,440
I got a good nose.

799
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:28,380
He happens to be something
you'll never be, a gentleman.

800
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:30,351
He happens to be a sweet-looking dude...

801
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,685
and a woman that'd pay any heed to him
ought to have her head looked into.

802
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:35,121
Oh, I see.

803
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,992
In other words,
you mean I'm just plumb crazy.

804
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:46,827
- Phoebe, I was only trying to tell you that...
- Good night, Sgt. Muncie.

805
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,896
Good night. The dinner was good.
