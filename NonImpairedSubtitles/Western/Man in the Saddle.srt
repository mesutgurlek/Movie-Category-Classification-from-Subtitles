1
00:01:13,249 --> 00:01:16,605
You'll have to hurry, Mr. Isham, or
you'll be late for your own wedding.

2
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:30,840
Nobody buys a drink tonight.

3
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:34,922
Boys, I'd like you all to shake hands
with Fay Dutcher, Skull's new foreman.

4
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:38,081
Will Isham sent all the way to
Texas for him to ramrod our outfit.

5
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:40,922
Happy to meet you folks. And
with my boss getting married...

6
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:43,239
this will be the biggest
night this town has seen.

7
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,207
So crowd around, everybody, we
got to do something about it.

8
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:48,727
"Do something about it."

9
00:02:48,809 --> 00:02:51,403
The question is, what are
you gonna do about it, Owen?

10
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:54,925
The Methodist minister is here. So
I guess it'll be a proper wedding.

11
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:59,128
- The women have started crying already.
- What makes women cry at weddings?

12
00:02:59,249 --> 00:03:00,477
Yeah, what?

13
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,162
You drunk yet, Owen?

14
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:08,120
- The bottle is still about half full.
- Then you're sober.

15
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:11,323
I don't know where they hide,
or where they come from...

16
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:13,559
but there's a lot of
pretty girls in town.

17
00:03:13,649 --> 00:03:16,447
- Takes a wedding to bring them out.
- Maybe it's hope.

18
00:03:18,369 --> 00:03:20,929
Antelope are running pretty
heavy over in Fremont Basin.

19
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:23,318
Guess it's time I had
another look at that country.

20
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:24,728
That's your trouble.

21
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:27,562
Always taking another
look at a piece of country.

22
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:30,800
Just fiddle-footed,
smelling the wind for scent.

23
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:34,878
- So you lose your girl.
- To a man like Will Isham.

24
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:38,963
Now...

25
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:41,481
the bottle's empty. Let's take a walk.

26
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:44,686
What for? You're always
taking a walk. Why?

27
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:49,163
- I'm tired of listening to long speeches.
- I ain't said nothing, but I will.

28
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:53,288
Owen, you and Prine and
me are just small ranchers.

29
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:56,645
Good neighbours, never
paid like Isham...

30
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:59,960
but that's no reason we should
always let him have his own way.

31
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:01,118
He is.

32
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:05,040
- Lf Laurie Bidwell was my girl...
- Drink up. It's Skull's treat.

33
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:09,044
- I'll pay for my drinks.
- Me, too.

34
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:10,926
Mike and Ike, they talk alike.

35
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,564
What have you fellows
got against Skull Ranch?

36
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:15,641
So you're Fay Dutcher?

37
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,000
They sure dress them fancy in Texas.

38
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:21,322
I said, what have you fellows
got against drinking on Skull?

39
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:24,606
- This is the Vird boys, Juke and George.
- We work for Owen Merritt.

40
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:27,726
- He sits right over there.
- Well, that explains it.

41
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:29,761
It don't explain nothing.

42
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,085
Will Isham didn't have to send clean
to Texas for just a ranch foreman.

43
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:38,128
- What are you, a professional
gun-hand? - Me? A gun-hand?

44
00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:40,602
I'm a cattleman, sir.

45
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:42,197
I just carry this thing...

46
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:44,644
because my old mother thought
it looked pretty on me.

47
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:48,404
Yeah? It was plenty fancy shooting I
saw, the way you knocked off that bottle.

48
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,127
Just luck, plain luck.

49
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:52,518
I couldn't shoot my way
out of a chicken coop.

50
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:01,647
Lucky again. This
must be my lucky night.

51
00:05:10,369 --> 00:05:11,688
Juke, George.

52
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:18,358
Owen.

53
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:28,329
I'm glad to see you because
I wanted a word with you.

54
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:31,202
You've got the floor.

55
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:34,398
I want to know how
you take this marriage.

56
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:37,640
If there's going to be trouble
between us, I'd like to know it now.

57
00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:41,442
Will, I congratulate you.

58
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:44,684
You're sure?

59
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:48,686
The luck is yours. No complaints.

60
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:51,528
I want the truth...

61
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:54,963
and I want everybody
in this room to hear it.

62
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:57,965
I won't have rumours going around.

63
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:02,168
I said, I wish you luck.
Better let it go at that.

64
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:06,643
Let's drink on that.

65
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,678
Gentlemen, this is on Skull.

66
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,008
To the future Mrs. Isham.

67
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,040
Her health and yours, Will.

68
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:28,324
You'll excuse me...

69
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:31,924
but I don't wish to appear before
the Bishop with liquor on me.

70
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:34,928
Croker, I'm buying the house
for the rest of the night.

71
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:38,122
Mr. Dutcher already set
them up at your expense.

72
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:42,448
That's very generous of you.

73
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:45,238
Good night.

74
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:52,964
Well, so you're Owen Merritt.

75
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:56,361
Genuine pleasure meeting you.
Gonna be our next-door neighbour.

76
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,882
Not quite next door.

77
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:00,324
- My ranch is in between.
- Is that so?

78
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:03,799
Well, look at the groom
what ain't going to be.

79
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:08,767
You know, Laurie's old man is out there
bragging about his son-in-law already.

80
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:12,639
You know, she'll see that the
old coot is well taken care of.

81
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,045
You didn't have to do
that. He's drunk, Owen.

82
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:23,723
It's talk I don't like to hear,
from a drunk or from anybody else.

83
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:26,562
- You're likely to hear more than that.
- Take it easy.

84
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,478
This is my job.

85
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:31,682
On your feet, Bale.

86
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:40,848
Now get going. Head back to the ranch.

87
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:43,047
- What did I do?
- Get!

88
00:07:45,489 --> 00:07:48,606
I hate to see a gent forget his
manners. It does something to me.

89
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:50,725
I must apologize for
my men, neighbour.

90
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:55,082
- Have a drink?
- No, thanks.

91
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:59,963
This is Will Isham's
night, so drink up, folks.

92
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,679
Will Isham had a reason
for buying you a drink...

93
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:06,804
in front of that crowd.

94
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:09,244
- Peace and good will.
- Good will, my fat aunt's foot.

95
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:11,797
You shouldn't have had that
drink. It ties your hands.

96
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:13,720
How long are you gonna
let Isham crowd you?

97
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:15,003
Excuse me, gentlemen.

98
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:17,842
Look, that's Laurie
Bidwell's wedding bouquet.

99
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:21,285
Now if I was you and you was
me, I'd mosey up them stairs...

100
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:23,929
and I'd get a rig and
drive around to the back...

101
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:25,283
and wait there for both of us.

102
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:26,927
But I'm not you and you're not me.

103
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:29,398
Owen, when I saw her
earlier, she wasn't smiling.

104
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:31,684
I tell you, Laurie's
heart's not in this wedding.

105
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:33,760
Maybe. But her mind's made up.

106
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:40,159
I'll meet you at the horses in five
minutes, then we'll leave this town.

107
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:53,641
- Clagg, what do you think of Owen Merritt?
- I don't like him. I never have.

108
00:08:53,729 --> 00:08:56,004
From what I hear, you don't
like much of anybody...

109
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:57,681
and nobody likes you, either.

110
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:59,760
It's not worth the
powder to blow you apart.

111
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:02,443
Nobody in 500 miles would
stop to pick up the pieces.

112
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:06,727
Still, I might have use for a
Ione wolf like you now and then.

113
00:09:07,369 --> 00:09:10,406
Just in case I don't get
around to doing my own chores.

114
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:21,398
Nan.

115
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:28,559
- Owen.  - I'd like to talk
 to Laurie if she'll see me.

116
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:32,323
She'll see you. But are
you sure you want her to?

117
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:33,758
Why not?

118
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:36,244
All right, Owen.

119
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:54,039
Laurie, are you sure
it's got to be this way?

120
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:58,407
- Is that all you came to say?
- It's enough, isn't it?

121
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:01,727
- You're condemning me.
- No.

122
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:04,324
You're the one that
made the choice, not me.

123
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:06,969
All I want to know is if you're sure.

124
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:09,881
I've got to be sure, haven't I?

125
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:17,006
- Then I wish you luck. So long.
- Wait.

126
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,568
You're coming to the wedding?

127
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:20,321
- No.
- Please.

128
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:22,642
To make the record complete?

129
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:27,843
Is it so hard to believe that I
can still take an interest in you?

130
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:30,040
Don't you understand that yet?

131
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:32,484
I guess I do.

132
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:35,887
You're an ambitious girl, Laurie.

133
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:39,719
You set your mind on
certain things long ago.

134
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:43,040
- I couldn't break up that.
- I was ambitious for both of us.

135
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:46,201
But there was a restlessness in
you I couldn't fight any longer.

136
00:10:46,289 --> 00:10:48,803
- I got tired of waiting.
- I don't blame you.

137
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:50,643
You always figured...

138
00:10:50,729 --> 00:10:52,799
you could make your mind
pull your heart along.

139
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:54,117
I hope you can.

140
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:56,727
I know what I'm doing, Owen.

141
00:10:57,729 --> 00:11:01,358
We always argued too much.
That was one of our faults.

142
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:11,527
- Good night, Owen.
- Goodbye.

143
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:17,088
It's time to go.

144
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:20,204
I'm ready.

145
00:11:35,609 --> 00:11:38,999
- Owen, you're a
putty-headed fool. - Shut up.

146
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:49,119
- Quite a party, boss.
- For this occasion.

147
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:53,042
- Here's to you and your bride.
- Why, thank you, Judge.

148
00:11:57,769 --> 00:11:58,918
Congratulations.

149
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,204
- Best of luck.
- Much happiness.

150
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:04,361
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Judge. Thank you.

151
00:12:05,369 --> 00:12:07,883
There's enough champagne
water there to drown a horse.

152
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:10,483
Mr. Isham had it shipped all
the way from San Francisco.

153
00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:12,764
- Won't you have some?
- I don't drink.

154
00:12:23,849 --> 00:12:24,998
Nan.

155
00:12:27,729 --> 00:12:29,367
Can I see you home from the party?

156
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,519
- Another night.
- You got a date?

157
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:34,489
No, but after helping Laurie
with her wedding all day...

158
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:35,718
I'm about run down.

159
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:38,967
- I wouldn't be good company for anyone.
- I wouldn't care.

160
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:41,764
Why can't we be friends
like everyone else, Nan?

161
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:45,080
- I hope we'll always be friends, Hugh.
- You don't fool me.

162
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:46,966
Why don't you ever smile at me, Nan?

163
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:50,678
Sometimes I come out of the hills, stand
near your cabin and watch the light.

164
00:12:50,849 --> 00:12:52,567
Sometimes I come close to the door.

165
00:12:52,849 --> 00:12:55,522
You don't know what I feel
inside. I'd tear off my arms...

166
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,964
I'd burn Springrock down
to ashes if you wanted it.

167
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:00,847
There isn't anything I
wouldn't do for you, anything.

168
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:03,321
- Hugh.
- Anything.

169
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:07,564
All right, then.

170
00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:10,121
There's the dance on Saturday night.

171
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:13,444
Yes, I'll call for you.

172
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:15,567
Now, if you'll excuse me.

173
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:25,158
We Ishams are going to show you
all just what luxury really is.

174
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:28,408
We're going to open
the doors of Skull...

175
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:32,721
and ask you all to come in and eat
and drink the finest food and liquor...

176
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:34,128
that money can buy.

177
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:36,685
That's a very
hospitable proposal, Dad.

178
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:39,078
I'm sure my husband would
be happy to second it.

179
00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:42,281
- Why, of course.
- Congratulations again.

180
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:46,888
I lost me a daughter,
but I got me a son.

181
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,321
Dad, you must be tired. Wouldn't
you like to go to your room?

182
00:13:50,449 --> 00:13:51,564
Excuse us, please.

183
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:55,718
Lankershim.

184
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:58,484
I'd like to talk to you in the study.

185
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:06,082
- Come outside.
- What for?

186
00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:11,088
Get on your horse and leave.

187
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:13,365
- Now lookie here.
- You lookie here.

188
00:14:13,609 --> 00:14:16,169
I'm not gonna have you
panhandling off of Skull.

189
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:19,089
You'd send me away?

190
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:21,004
My own daughter?

191
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:23,320
I'm now Will Isham's wife.

192
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:26,207
And you'll not keep me from
having the respect and dignity...

193
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:27,404
that he expects me to have.

194
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:29,327
After all I've done for you.

195
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:31,877
- The way I raised you.
- The way you raised me?

196
00:14:32,609 --> 00:14:35,248
I saw Mother work like
a horse to keep us alive.

197
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:38,198
I saw her die, out of shame, mostly.

198
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:42,527
What'll I do, daughter? Where'll I go?

199
00:14:42,609 --> 00:14:44,281
Go back south where you used to live.

200
00:14:44,369 --> 00:14:48,157
You won't starve. I'll send you money,
but you've got to stay away from Skull...

201
00:14:48,249 --> 00:14:49,398
and from Will Isham.

202
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:53,487
I've got a chance to be
something the Bidwells never were.

203
00:14:53,969 --> 00:14:56,927
And you're not gonna
ruin it. Goodbye, Dad.

204
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:10,765
- Pay, would you like some brandy?
- I don't drink.

205
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,479
I'm going to buy your ranch tonight.

206
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,640
You aiming to threaten me, Will?

207
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:22,725
If you are, I'm too grown up to scare.

208
00:15:24,849 --> 00:15:27,807
I'm gonna make it so worthwhile,
you can't afford not to sell.

209
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:30,444
I'll give you $50,000 cash.

210
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:33,607
It ain't worth nigh that.

211
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:37,239
There's a small lake, a waterhole,
that straddles your land and mine.

212
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:38,923
Well, what of it?

213
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:41,928
There's more than enough
water there for both our herds.

214
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:43,768
You don't get the idea.

215
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:46,522
I'd only own half a lake.

216
00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:51,045
I never own half of anything, I
own it all. Lock, stock and barrel.

217
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:52,448
That goes for anything.

218
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:56,808
Whatever I have is mine and mine
alone. I'll share with no one.

219
00:15:57,969 --> 00:16:00,529
You're a strange man
to figure, Will...

220
00:16:01,489 --> 00:16:03,445
but I reckon you can't be beat.

221
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:06,278
I'll sell.

222
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:10,605
If a man like Owen Merritt wouldn't
fight for what belonged to him...

223
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:13,719
I reckon I'm too old to try.

224
00:16:17,849 --> 00:16:19,601
What belonged to him, Pay?

225
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:24,679
Pay, you're my guest
and I'll say nothing.

226
00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:30,126
But when you ride off Skull tonight,
don't ever come back on my land again.

227
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:38,687
I'll pick up the papers at the
bank and give you your money.

228
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:03,722
What happened to your father?

229
00:17:04,729 --> 00:17:07,562
He's going away on a trip.
He won't be back to Skull.

230
00:17:08,649 --> 00:17:12,198
You're a smart woman, Laurie. I
was very pleased. You've got tact.

231
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:14,969
You know how to handle people
and make them feel good.

232
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:16,118
Thank you.

233
00:17:16,729 --> 00:17:17,957
That's what you want.

234
00:17:28,609 --> 00:17:30,122
What is it you want, Laurie?

235
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:33,287
Nothing more than I'm getting now.

236
00:17:34,489 --> 00:17:36,525
You know my family, what I came from.

237
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:38,602
I'm grateful to you, Will.

238
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:41,609
And I'll never let you down
on my part of the bargain.

239
00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:42,678
Remember that.

240
00:17:43,449 --> 00:17:45,360
I'll play the part
you want me to play.

241
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:49,369
Is this nothing more than
a bargain with you, Laurie?

242
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:50,644
Nothing more?

243
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:55,088
Did I ever give you the
impression it would be otherwise?

244
00:17:56,689 --> 00:17:58,566
No. I'll give you credit. You didn't.

245
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:02,164
Good night, Laurie.

246
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:05,524
Good night, Will.

247
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,887
Help yourself to the whiskey.

248
00:18:52,729 --> 00:18:54,003
Thanks, boss.

249
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,078
Here's to you.

250
00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:02,324
- What about it?  - Skull is now
 up against Owen Merritt's line.

251
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:03,728
What's wrong with that?

252
00:19:04,129 --> 00:19:07,121
In spite of what he said, you
don't trust Merritt a bit, do you?

253
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:08,562
No. And I never will.

254
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:12,482
In that case, I'd better get
on with what I came here for.

255
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:16,127
Because the longer I put it off...

256
00:19:16,209 --> 00:19:18,518
the longer he'll be
standing on those stairs...

257
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:20,283
between you and her.

258
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:53,646
All rounded up and tallied, Bourke.

259
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:56,079
Looks like this year you're
a dozen head up on me.

260
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:57,204
Is that right?

261
00:19:57,289 --> 00:20:00,326
The way prices are, reckon we
both ought to do all right...

262
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:02,001
when we get this batch to market.

263
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:04,319
When do you figure we
ought to move them, Owen?

264
00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:06,999
Look, the rest of the
outfit just showed up.

265
00:20:15,209 --> 00:20:18,406
Hello, Nan. Your herd
is sure getting big.

266
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:20,562
This year I have 10 head.

267
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:29,998
Howdy, partner.

268
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:32,408
Need an extra hand, mister?

269
00:20:32,489 --> 00:20:34,719
Sure, if you can cook
better than Cultus Charley.

270
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:36,208
Almost anybody can do that.

271
00:20:37,729 --> 00:20:40,197
- Hello, Charley.
- Hello.

272
00:20:42,689 --> 00:20:45,362
Is he still making you
sing for your supper?

273
00:20:46,249 --> 00:20:47,921
Sure is, Nan.

274
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,405
- Howdy, Nan.
- Hello, George.

275
00:20:52,489 --> 00:20:54,798
- All set for the big cattle drive?
- Sure am.

276
00:20:55,249 --> 00:20:57,126
How many head you
shipping this year? Six?

277
00:20:57,209 --> 00:20:58,483
I've got 10.

278
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:02,561
And you just see that nothing
happens to those steer.

279
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:06,005
They're the best beef in this
section, practically hand-fed.

280
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:07,317
I'll be doggone.

281
00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:09,799
Here I always thought
they only ate grass.

282
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:13,606
- Coffee. Hot coffee.
- That sounds wonderful.

283
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,442
What happened to the cookies
you made at the ranch, Charley?

284
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:20,238
I don't know what happened. I
feed the pigs. Pigs get sick.

285
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:23,846
As a cook, Charley, I'll bet you're
a whiz at baking adobe bricks.

286
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:28,165
What's the matter,
Juke? Something wrong?

287
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:32,683
Say, what is this anyway?

288
00:21:32,969 --> 00:21:35,961
- Coffee. Good coffee.
- I doubt that.

289
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:39,803
Charley uses gunpowder instead of
coffee. Pretty soon your head blows off.

290
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:42,678
I know. Mine just passed the moon.

291
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:45,687
Doesn't seem to bother Charley.

292
00:21:45,969 --> 00:21:48,722
Charley no fool. Charley drinks tea.

293
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:55,762
You two cut out the horseplay
and pick up those strays.

294
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:59,558
Sure, boss. Anything you
say, boss. Right away, boss.

295
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:01,522
And don't call me boss.

296
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:04,641
All right, boss.

297
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:11,403
- Where's Pay Lankershim?
- He ain't shipping with us.

298
00:22:12,009 --> 00:22:14,284
We've been bunching
our herds for years.

299
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:15,358
No more.

300
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:19,128
Pay sold out to Will
Isham. Everything.

301
00:22:22,689 --> 00:22:25,522
- That makes Skull your neighbour now.
- Yeah.

302
00:22:26,969 --> 00:22:29,802
Stay away from trouble,
Owen. It comes easy to you.

303
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:33,399
It'll come still easier 'cause you're
in a frame of mind to have some.

304
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:36,362
Besides, it's always been a
great comfort to me at night...

305
00:22:36,449 --> 00:22:39,486
to look across the desert and see
your light shining on the hill.

306
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:42,129
- I hope I'll see it there always.
- It'll be there.

307
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:47,007
There's no woman in the world
worth tearing yourself apart for.

308
00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:51,640
And you'd better take
care of my cattle.

309
00:24:58,209 --> 00:25:00,439
The cattle are restless,
getting pretty spooky.

310
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:04,246
- Bad smell in the wind.
- Couldn't be your cooking.

311
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:07,361
- There we go.
- We'll be moving out around 4:00.

312
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:10,481
Hitch up and have Chuck ready
for us at the springs by daybreak.

313
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:32,158
If I catch you under my
hat again, I'll plug you.

314
00:25:32,249 --> 00:25:34,319
Or worse, make you
drink your own coffee.

315
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:40,885
- Don't you think that I need a new hat?
- No. The hat needs a new head.

316
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,359
And weren't you told
to hook up the horses?

317
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:38,048
Boys, look!

318
00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:47,089
You ride the herd. I'll try
to turn it with the wagon.

319
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:40,198
Juke!

320
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:46,884
Owen!

321
00:29:53,969 --> 00:29:55,402
Stampede ran him down.

322
00:29:56,009 --> 00:29:58,318
Yeah, after he was shot
in the back of the head.

323
00:29:58,569 --> 00:30:00,161
- Charley, get a blanket.
- Yes.

324
00:30:00,249 --> 00:30:01,443
My brother, dead.

325
00:30:01,609 --> 00:30:04,077
- Who were they, Owen? Do you know?
- Couldn't tell.

326
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:05,844
Juke knew.

327
00:30:07,129 --> 00:30:08,642
You got nothing to say, Owen?

328
00:30:09,089 --> 00:30:11,649
There's only one bunch that
had a reason to do this.

329
00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:17,403
If Skull got Juke, they did it to
get me. They knew how close we were.

330
00:30:17,489 --> 00:30:19,639
Then wake up. Quit
mooning over Laurie.

331
00:30:19,729 --> 00:30:21,845
You know just as well as
I do that Will Isham...

332
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:23,920
can't bear to have
anything stand in his way.

333
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:24,998
You do.

334
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:29,884
George.

335
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:14,438
Over there.

336
00:33:22,089 --> 00:33:23,681
A little warm in there, mister.

337
00:33:35,689 --> 00:33:37,088
Don't tell me, Bale.

338
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:42,239
Clay on the shoe of your horse out there
comes from only one place, Coral Flats.

339
00:33:42,609 --> 00:33:44,008
Well, Mr. Merritt.

340
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:47,242
Come in. I was thinking about you.

341
00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:49,402
These boys were just getting set...

342
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:51,844
for a little celebration
after what they did tonight.

343
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:54,363
I was about to oblige them
with some good clean fun...

344
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,360
but I don't think
they like the odds now.

345
00:33:57,009 --> 00:34:00,365
Tell you what, Owen, you and
me don't want to spoil anything.

346
00:34:00,449 --> 00:34:03,043
So let's you and me go down
the street and have a drink.

347
00:34:03,129 --> 00:34:05,643
George and I'll go down
the street and have a drink.

348
00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:08,158
- Come on, George.
- Don't be like that, Owen.

349
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:13,281
My motto is: Never interfere...

350
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:15,929
when a man's out for some
good, clean fun and enjoyment.

351
00:34:16,009 --> 00:34:18,921
Just shoot him in the back of
the head like you got my brother.

352
00:34:19,009 --> 00:34:22,365
Skull hands wouldn't shoot anybody.
They're cattlemen, like Mr. Dutcher.

353
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:24,758
He couldn't shoot his
way out of a chicken coop.

354
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:29,283
I've had enough of his talk.
What's it gonna be, Fay?

355
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:31,523
Yeah, what?

356
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:34,117
Let's find out.

357
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:45,357
You're all standing around
here braced for a fight.

358
00:34:46,089 --> 00:34:49,047
Which one of you was gonna handle
George? Or was it all of you?

359
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,484
Sure the whole bunch. Skull style.

360
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,562
A wolf pack on one man like
they got my brother, Juke.

361
00:34:56,649 --> 00:34:58,719
All right, men, scratch for it.

362
00:35:00,129 --> 00:35:03,041
Killed a poor kid like Juke,
who never did nothing to nobody.

363
00:36:15,129 --> 00:36:16,767
Well, Bale started it.

364
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:19,005
I can sleep a little better now.

365
00:36:21,089 --> 00:36:22,920
Sort of takes care of Juke.

366
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:44,606
- I was riding your way.
- Glad I saved you the trip.

367
00:36:44,889 --> 00:36:47,323
- Hello, Laurie.
- Hello, Owen.

368
00:36:48,529 --> 00:36:51,248
I'll be with Mrs. Keenan.
She wants to fit my new dress.

369
00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:54,478
Will.

370
00:36:58,569 --> 00:36:59,888
I want a word with you.

371
00:37:04,129 --> 00:37:05,608
What are you so jumpy about?

372
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:09,926
- Do you want trouble with me?
- I've been having trouble with you.

373
00:37:10,009 --> 00:37:12,443
But from now on you're going
to have trouble with me.

374
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:15,202
- Is that an offer, Owen?
- Yeah, it's an offer.

375
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,038
Merritt.

376
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:21,643
I'll tell you something.

377
00:37:22,009 --> 00:37:24,443
I've never liked you, your
manners, or your style.

378
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:27,889
I'm thinking about something,
and you know what it is.

379
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:32,157
What belongs to me is mine, entirely
mine. Do you hear? So stay away.

380
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:35,729
Stay away from everything
that belongs to me.

381
00:37:36,409 --> 00:37:39,082
Just make sure that you hang
on to what belongs to you.

382
00:38:08,209 --> 00:38:09,608
One horse is coming.

383
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:14,248
Better drop that cigarette.

384
00:38:14,649 --> 00:38:17,322
The house is all lit
up. You're pretty jumpy.

385
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:21,638
Yeah, I am. I feel it...

386
00:38:22,689 --> 00:38:23,758
close.

387
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:26,479
Like a man feels when a
gun's pointing at him...

388
00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:28,048
even when he can't see it.

389
00:38:38,929 --> 00:38:40,999
You haven't seen
anything tonight, George.

390
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:42,878
Sure.

391
00:38:57,009 --> 00:39:01,161
- Not a very good place for you to be,
 Laurie.  - I know. I had to see you.

392
00:39:03,249 --> 00:39:04,807
- May I sit down?
- Please do.

393
00:39:08,609 --> 00:39:10,167
Owen, what are you thinking?

394
00:39:11,529 --> 00:39:14,601
- Things I shouldn't.
- I was afraid you would.

395
00:39:15,849 --> 00:39:17,407
And afraid you wouldn't, too.

396
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,480
What was it you came here to say?

397
00:39:22,009 --> 00:39:25,160
It's my husband. His
pride is terribly strong.

398
00:39:25,929 --> 00:39:29,524
It makes him wonder if I still
feel about you as I once did.

399
00:39:29,689 --> 00:39:30,678
Do you?

400
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:37,044
Owen, Skull's too big, too
big for you to fight alone.

401
00:39:37,449 --> 00:39:40,964
- There's nothing else to do.
- Sell out to Will. Leave the country.

402
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:42,318
No, Laurie.

403
00:39:45,529 --> 00:39:47,406
I thought I could make you see it.

404
00:39:53,369 --> 00:39:56,361
You doubted that I could make
my mind pull my heart along.

405
00:39:57,369 --> 00:40:00,202
- You're right, Owen, I can't.
- I'm sorry.

406
00:40:02,249 --> 00:40:04,604
Sometimes ambition
can be bad for people.

407
00:40:05,769 --> 00:40:07,361
It can hurt them so much.

408
00:40:08,689 --> 00:40:12,477
Now there may be more
bloodshed all because of me.

409
00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:16,327
You say you won't run away, Owen.

410
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:20,366
But if I break my bargain with
Will and run away with you...

411
00:40:20,849 --> 00:40:22,043
then would you leave?

412
00:40:22,729 --> 00:40:24,048
You'd go that far for me?

413
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:27,802
I would. I'll be here tomorrow night.

414
00:41:16,889 --> 00:41:19,119
George.

415
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:25,243
Have you seen George?

416
00:41:26,169 --> 00:41:28,922
No, he's not here.

417
00:41:29,649 --> 00:41:32,322
He don't feel sleep. He
going out to see the cattle.

418
00:41:33,249 --> 00:41:34,477
He told me not to tell.

419
00:41:34,569 --> 00:41:35,922
- Yeah?
- Yes.

420
00:41:37,049 --> 00:41:41,486
- I'd better go look for him.
- Everybody go away. I have to stay here.

421
00:41:41,569 --> 00:41:43,958
- I don't like this place.
- Spooky, Charley?

422
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:47,083
Like a long time ago
when Chief Egden...

423
00:41:47,609 --> 00:41:49,998
he come through with his guerrillas.

424
00:41:51,369 --> 00:41:54,202
I had a bad feelings, like I have now.

425
00:41:54,609 --> 00:41:57,521
I hear the trees talk.

426
00:41:57,609 --> 00:42:01,397
I hear the water talks. It's not good.

427
00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:04,726
- Keep away from that vanilla extract.
- What do you mean?

428
00:42:06,809 --> 00:42:07,958
Blow out that light.

429
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:19,968
Four horses.

430
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:40,158
Look.

431
00:42:57,169 --> 00:42:59,285
George, who did it?

432
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:22,166
Bad feelings like old days.

433
00:43:55,929 --> 00:43:58,045
Rise and shine, you lunkhead.

434
00:44:11,929 --> 00:44:13,282
Why don't you shoot?

435
00:44:13,369 --> 00:44:15,758
I was just thinking, when
I pull this trigger...

436
00:44:15,849 --> 00:44:18,921
I'll be shooting Christmas Creek
Ranch right out from under me.

437
00:44:19,169 --> 00:44:21,524
It'll start a run and jump fight.

438
00:44:22,169 --> 00:44:25,844
Sitting on my porch night after
night was getting dull anyway.

439
00:44:34,249 --> 00:44:37,400
What are you shooting at this hour
of the morning all by yourself?

440
00:45:01,129 --> 00:45:03,882
What are you trying
to do? Is this a joke?

441
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:06,608
No joke, Repp. You know I can
shoot straighter than that.

442
00:45:06,689 --> 00:45:09,647
Someone from Skull got one of
my men last night. Who was it?

443
00:45:11,969 --> 00:45:13,118
I don't know.

444
00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:16,162
Who was it, Repp?

445
00:45:16,409 --> 00:45:20,163
You're wrong, Merritt.
None of us shot George Vird.

446
00:45:21,489 --> 00:45:23,605
Repp, how did you know it was Vird?

447
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:27,808
I just thought that...

448
00:45:31,889 --> 00:45:35,643
Think faster, Repp. Send him
out, or I'll shoot to kill.

449
00:45:39,409 --> 00:45:41,718
Merritt, listen!

450
00:45:42,049 --> 00:45:43,641
No time for talk.

451
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,284
Look.

452
00:45:59,569 --> 00:46:01,844
You can't fight the whole army.

453
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:06,800
Charley, get word to Mrs. Isham that
I won't be around for a few days.

454
00:46:36,249 --> 00:46:40,561
That Merritt, he just shot us all
up. He knows about George Vird, too.

455
00:46:41,169 --> 00:46:44,366
Dutcher, are you gonna
let him get away with this?

456
00:48:52,249 --> 00:48:53,284
Shoot.

457
00:49:10,329 --> 00:49:12,889
Much shooting on
Señor Merritt's rancho.

458
00:49:15,769 --> 00:49:18,408
- Will you saddle my horse, please?
- Yes.

459
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:35,798
Spread out. You got to find him.

460
00:50:53,569 --> 00:50:54,684
What are you doing?

461
00:50:54,769 --> 00:50:57,488
Paying him back for what they
did to our line cabin today.

462
00:50:57,569 --> 00:50:59,525
Get out. Why don't you grow up?

463
00:51:00,369 --> 00:51:04,157
- Just when I was having a little fun.
- This is no time for kid's games.

464
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,121
Someone is coming.

465
00:51:22,089 --> 00:51:23,761
You and your shooting.

466
00:51:47,529 --> 00:51:50,646
Nan, over here.

467
00:52:07,009 --> 00:52:08,567
This may sting.

468
00:52:12,449 --> 00:52:14,838
Here, put some inside of you, too.

469
00:52:15,489 --> 00:52:17,081
You'll hate that.

470
00:52:22,489 --> 00:52:23,808
Feel better?

471
00:52:28,569 --> 00:52:30,207
My favorite pair.

472
00:52:33,769 --> 00:52:36,647
Owen, why did you go back
to your place tonight?

473
00:52:36,729 --> 00:52:40,642
I got to thinking, a man
can't run all the time.

474
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:43,124
He has to fight sooner or later.

475
00:52:45,609 --> 00:52:48,362
Nan, thanks for everything,
but I got to get out of here...

476
00:52:48,449 --> 00:52:49,928
or you'll be in a mess of trouble.

477
00:52:50,009 --> 00:52:51,328
You can't.

478
00:52:52,089 --> 00:52:55,240
Come on now. Sit back.
You've lost a lot of blood.

479
00:53:00,569 --> 00:53:02,048
That's better.

480
00:53:02,729 --> 00:53:05,084
Stop trying to be a
hero and get some rest.

481
00:53:23,009 --> 00:53:25,887
Hitch up the buckboard. I'm
taking Miss Nan to the dance.

482
00:53:31,369 --> 00:53:32,722
Hello, Nan.

483
00:53:34,089 --> 00:53:36,444
- I told you, hitch up the buckboard.
- No buckboard.

484
00:53:36,529 --> 00:53:38,121
- Nan.
- No Nan.

485
00:53:39,169 --> 00:53:41,967
We've a date for the dance
tonight. She couldn't have forgot.

486
00:53:42,049 --> 00:53:44,199
I've been counting on it
all week. She promised.

487
00:53:47,169 --> 00:53:48,443
Bandages.

488
00:53:48,969 --> 00:53:51,722
Owen Merritt was shot last
night. He came here, didn't he?

489
00:53:52,809 --> 00:53:54,765
She's gone off with him.

490
00:53:55,169 --> 00:53:57,046
I don't ask for much.

491
00:53:57,329 --> 00:54:00,127
Just take her to a dance, and
be with her once in a while.

492
00:54:00,369 --> 00:54:04,282
Merritt doesn't love her, but it
don't make no difference to her.

493
00:54:04,369 --> 00:54:07,486
She'd run off with him.
She'd do anything he asks.

494
00:54:10,209 --> 00:54:12,359
I ought to kill both of them.

495
00:54:12,969 --> 00:54:14,197
Where are they?

496
00:54:20,609 --> 00:54:22,964
I'll find them.

497
00:54:31,169 --> 00:54:34,764
You stay here and make sure Mrs.
Isham doesn't leave the house.

498
00:54:35,289 --> 00:54:37,678
We're ready to start
after Merritt, Mr. Isham.

499
00:54:44,609 --> 00:54:48,124
I've never seen in you the
desire to destroy, to kill.

500
00:54:48,209 --> 00:54:50,439
- Have I killed?
- Your men have.

501
00:54:50,529 --> 00:54:53,487
You hired them and you supported them.

502
00:54:53,569 --> 00:54:56,641
Owen Merritt killed one of my men,
and I suppose that's all right.

503
00:54:56,729 --> 00:54:59,402
If you'd have been in his
place, what would you have done?

504
00:54:59,489 --> 00:55:01,002
I'm not in his place.

505
00:55:03,409 --> 00:55:07,288
Suppose you'd known before our marriage
that I meant to go after Merritt.

506
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:09,800
Would you have married me?

507
00:55:10,369 --> 00:55:12,246
What a brutal question.

508
00:55:12,769 --> 00:55:14,725
Thanks for the compliment.

509
00:55:25,009 --> 00:55:27,125
Now remember, watch
her like I told you to.

510
00:55:36,729 --> 00:55:37,957
You don't like coffee?

511
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:42,085
I knew this stuff was
good for something.

512
00:55:42,169 --> 00:55:44,285
Look. Boot polish.

513
00:55:45,089 --> 00:55:48,126
Charley, you been around this
country 1,000 years or so.

514
00:55:48,209 --> 00:55:51,167
What kind of scout are you?
How good are you at tracking?

515
00:55:51,249 --> 00:55:53,888
- My father was good.
- But your father's dead.

516
00:55:53,969 --> 00:55:56,164
- What's he got to do with it?
- I am much better.

517
00:55:56,249 --> 00:55:59,764
Then get on that trail
and find Owen Merritt fast.

518
00:56:07,329 --> 00:56:09,604
You men see anything of
a buckboard going by here?

519
00:56:09,689 --> 00:56:10,758
Yeah.

520
00:56:11,449 --> 00:56:14,839
- Which way did they go?
- They went up into the mountains.

521
00:56:15,249 --> 00:56:17,444
- How long ago?
- Three days ago.

522
00:56:17,529 --> 00:56:18,644
Thank you.

523
00:56:32,049 --> 00:56:33,323
Who's that?

524
00:56:33,689 --> 00:56:34,758
Mrs. Isham.

525
00:56:37,809 --> 00:56:39,401
You got to stay here, Mrs. Isham.

526
00:56:39,489 --> 00:56:41,844
- Get away, Repp.
- Sorry, but I can't.

527
00:56:42,129 --> 00:56:46,042
- Get out of my way.
- Put that silly little thing away.

528
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:53,961
Repp, I've used a gun for years...

529
00:56:54,049 --> 00:56:56,882
and I could tear your collarbone
to pieces before you moved.

530
00:56:56,969 --> 00:56:59,767
- We'll see about this, ma'am.
- Take off your hat.

531
00:57:01,169 --> 00:57:03,558
Walk in front of me, and
run when I tell you to run.

532
00:57:03,649 --> 00:57:06,686
- I ain't taking orders from no lady.
- I'm not a lady, Repp.

533
00:57:06,769 --> 00:57:07,997
I'm the Bidwell girl...

534
00:57:08,089 --> 00:57:10,922
and I was raised among harder
men than you think you are.

535
00:57:11,009 --> 00:57:12,078
Now, get in front of me.

536
00:57:12,169 --> 00:57:15,639
And if you stop before I tell
you to, I'll shoot you. Come on.

537
01:00:41,689 --> 01:00:43,600
Maybe we can be leaving here soon.

538
01:00:44,009 --> 01:00:45,806
I could use a razor, if I had one.

539
01:00:46,089 --> 01:00:48,444
Sounds like a coyote
going through dry brush.

540
01:00:50,169 --> 01:00:51,682
It's good to hear you laugh.

541
01:00:52,009 --> 01:00:54,887
- There hasn't been much to laugh about.
- Yeah.

542
01:00:54,969 --> 01:00:57,437
Wish I could thank your
grandfather for this hideout.

543
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:59,724
He built it when they
first came to this country.

544
01:00:59,809 --> 01:01:02,004
It was a place of safety
against Indian raids.

545
01:01:02,089 --> 01:01:04,842
I'll take the Indians
to Skull any day.

546
01:01:06,489 --> 01:01:08,878
Owen, what are you gonna do now?

547
01:01:10,689 --> 01:01:12,759
The problem hasn't changed.

548
01:01:13,529 --> 01:01:15,599
So you're not going to run.

549
01:01:16,169 --> 01:01:18,637
- You want me to?
- No. Even if I did, you wouldn't.

550
01:01:18,729 --> 01:01:20,481
I know you too well for that.

551
01:01:21,129 --> 01:01:22,562
You'll stay and fight.

552
01:01:22,649 --> 01:01:25,561
I don't know how you'll do
it, but you'll do it somehow.

553
01:01:26,169 --> 01:01:27,727
But what about you?

554
01:01:27,889 --> 01:01:29,925
By now, everybody must
know you're with me.

555
01:01:30,009 --> 01:01:34,207
I don't care. It's been worth it.
I never had a man to boss before.

556
01:01:37,289 --> 01:01:41,601
Nan, whatever happens, the past
few days balance for everything.

557
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:44,166
That's the way I feel.

558
01:01:44,809 --> 01:01:46,322
I'd better get these dishes washed.

559
01:01:46,409 --> 01:01:47,842
Cheap woman.

560
01:01:49,649 --> 01:01:50,877
Don't try it, Merritt.

561
01:01:51,009 --> 01:01:54,399
I should smash your face in, running
off with this fiddle-foot like that.

562
01:01:54,489 --> 01:01:55,922
What's aching you, Clagg?

563
01:01:56,009 --> 01:01:57,522
Get away from that gun, Nan.

564
01:01:57,969 --> 01:02:01,041
Get back over there. Put your
hands behind you, both of you.

565
01:02:01,289 --> 01:02:03,120
Go on. Get back over there.

566
01:02:04,489 --> 01:02:06,400
Not too close together.

567
01:02:08,049 --> 01:02:10,165
What's the matter with
you? Have you gone crazy?

568
01:02:10,249 --> 01:02:11,682
Maybe I have.

569
01:02:12,129 --> 01:02:14,006
Merritt, you get
everything your own way.

570
01:02:14,089 --> 01:02:17,399
You can have Laurie by lifting your
finger if you wanted, and now Nan.

571
01:02:17,489 --> 01:02:19,320
What's the difference
between you and me?

572
01:02:19,409 --> 01:02:22,003
I'd claw down the hills for
a kind look from that girl...

573
01:02:22,089 --> 01:02:24,319
but I'd never get it,
not in a thousand years.

574
01:02:24,529 --> 01:02:27,965
You'd cheat for this man,
do just what he wanted.

575
01:02:28,049 --> 01:02:29,767
Pull up, Clagg.

576
01:02:34,729 --> 01:02:38,005
You two are fooling yourselves,
and I'm going to end it.

577
01:05:26,649 --> 01:05:27,843
No.

578
01:05:28,729 --> 01:05:30,526
- I could kill him!
- I know.

579
01:05:30,609 --> 01:05:33,487
- It's what he said, what he said
 about you.  - But it's wrong.

580
01:05:33,569 --> 01:05:35,525
I don't want you to kill anybody.

581
01:05:38,449 --> 01:05:40,121
Let's get started.

582
01:05:41,169 --> 01:05:43,558
She got away? But I told
you not to let her out of...

583
01:05:43,649 --> 01:05:46,209
You didn't tell me she had
a gun and knew how to use it.

584
01:05:46,289 --> 01:05:49,520
Look at that. And that
ain't all. My feet.

585
01:05:51,129 --> 01:05:54,007
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know, but she sure went fast.

586
01:06:06,169 --> 01:06:07,522
Been looking for you.

587
01:06:07,609 --> 01:06:10,077
Looks like you met up with
a mountain lion, maybe two.

588
01:06:10,169 --> 01:06:13,320
- Are you still looking for Merritt?
- So that's it. He chewed you up.

589
01:06:13,409 --> 01:06:14,808
Where is Merritt?

590
01:06:14,889 --> 01:06:18,199
Holed up in an old hideout
in Rock Canyon at the falls.

591
01:06:19,929 --> 01:06:22,602
He's probably gone by now,
but he'll be easy to trail.

592
01:06:22,689 --> 01:06:25,442
- He's got a woman with him.
- What woman, Clagg?

593
01:06:25,529 --> 01:06:27,042
What woman? Who do you think?

594
01:06:27,129 --> 01:06:28,482
The one woman of this country...

595
01:06:28,569 --> 01:06:31,242
who'll double-cross her own
soul to save Merritt's life.

596
01:06:41,329 --> 01:06:43,365
You're too free with
your tongue, Clagg.

597
01:06:47,889 --> 01:06:50,323
No man talks about my wife.

598
01:06:55,289 --> 01:06:57,564
It isn't the woman
you were thinking of.

599
01:06:58,369 --> 01:06:59,688
It wasn't your wife.

600
01:07:09,249 --> 01:07:12,480
Don't just stand there. Get your
horses. We're going to Rock Canyon.

601
01:07:49,409 --> 01:07:51,923
- Boss, I bring the horse for you.
- Good.

602
01:07:52,009 --> 01:07:54,842
You know, Owen, with the Skull
outfit hunting the hills...

603
01:07:54,929 --> 01:07:58,126
this would be a good time to go
to Isham's ranch and take it apart.

604
01:07:58,769 --> 01:07:59,838
No.

605
01:08:00,049 --> 01:08:01,368
Because Laurie's there?

606
01:08:01,449 --> 01:08:03,405
It'd serve Isham right
if you walked in...

607
01:08:03,489 --> 01:08:05,445
and took her away from
him while he's gone.

608
01:08:05,529 --> 01:08:08,202
- You could do it, you know.
- I have other plans.

609
01:08:08,369 --> 01:08:12,362
Owen, you won't be needing
me anymore. I'm going home.

610
01:08:18,489 --> 01:08:22,368
- Nan, wait!
- Goodbye, everybody. Good luck, Owen.

611
01:08:23,089 --> 01:08:24,681
Nan, I want to talk to you.

612
01:08:31,089 --> 01:08:33,922
I'll be doggone. Maybe
the wind is changing.

613
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:36,523
Maybe it's going to blow
in a different direction.

614
01:08:37,209 --> 01:08:39,677
If we're gonna take on Skull
in a run and jump fight...

615
01:08:39,769 --> 01:08:42,442
Not that kind of a fight.
There'll never be peace that way.

616
01:08:42,529 --> 01:08:46,078
Peace? The only peace you'll ever
get from Isham is rest in peace.

617
01:08:46,169 --> 01:08:48,967
Shooting is better.
And Skull's so big...

618
01:08:49,049 --> 01:08:50,721
So is a steer big.

619
01:08:51,049 --> 01:08:54,837
But when you're gonna eat him, you first
have to cut him up in little pieces.

620
01:09:03,929 --> 01:09:05,601
I don't care what you want, Mr. Isham.

621
01:09:05,689 --> 01:09:08,681
We've been in the saddle for six
hours, we'll stretch our legs.

622
01:09:08,769 --> 01:09:10,885
We can't stop now
when we may be close.

623
01:09:12,249 --> 01:09:16,128
You know, Mr. Isham, when you're hunting
a man that can shoot like Owen Merritt...

624
01:09:16,209 --> 01:09:19,326
go losing your head, and
you might lose your head.

625
01:09:21,369 --> 01:09:22,768
- Have a drink.
- Thanks.

626
01:09:22,849 --> 01:09:25,522
Sure could go for a shot of
something stronger than water.

627
01:09:25,609 --> 01:09:26,724
So could I.

628
01:09:27,889 --> 01:09:30,562
I just remembered, I got
to go fix a stirrup strap.

629
01:10:02,289 --> 01:10:03,722
Don't move around!

630
01:10:03,809 --> 01:10:07,085
I might miss in the dark,
and I don't like that.

631
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:08,443
You fellows are only fooling.

632
01:10:08,529 --> 01:10:11,760
- You wouldn't do this to me, would you?
- No, we wouldn't do it to you.

633
01:10:11,849 --> 01:10:15,000
We just wanted you to talk, but
things seem to have got out of hand.

634
01:10:15,089 --> 01:10:18,445
We didn't know the Vird brothers were
such good friends of these people.

635
01:10:18,529 --> 01:10:21,123
I didn't do nothing to
the Vird boys. Tell them.

636
01:10:21,209 --> 01:10:24,838
Cultus Charley, we think
you're going too far maybe.

637
01:10:25,209 --> 01:10:26,403
Maybe.

638
01:10:27,289 --> 01:10:29,007
I can throw closer.

639
01:10:32,929 --> 01:10:34,885
You see, Repp, it's no use.

640
01:10:34,969 --> 01:10:37,961
We three can't fight the whole
bunch in their end of the town.

641
01:10:38,409 --> 01:10:41,003
That's right, Repp.
I can't stop Charley.

642
01:10:41,449 --> 01:10:44,361
Stop him. Please stop him!

643
01:10:47,689 --> 01:10:49,600
He's a yellow coward.

644
01:10:50,369 --> 01:10:53,008
Fay Dutcher killed Juke Vird
the night of the stampede.

645
01:10:53,169 --> 01:10:56,081
- You killed George Vird.
- No, I didn't.

646
01:10:56,369 --> 01:10:58,041
Dutcher did that, too.

647
01:10:58,129 --> 01:10:59,403
Tell the truth, Repp.

648
01:10:59,489 --> 01:11:01,957
Will Isham gave orders for
both killings, didn't he?

649
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:03,687
I don't know nothing about that.

650
01:11:03,769 --> 01:11:06,567
None of the crew knew Dutcher
was going to kill them fellows.

651
01:11:06,649 --> 01:11:07,684
He laughed at them.

652
01:11:07,769 --> 01:11:10,886
He was still laughing when
they died, cold as ice.

653
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:15,287
You'll never tie Isham into this.

654
01:11:15,369 --> 01:11:19,078
You may rope Dutcher, but Isham
can always hire a new gunslinger.

655
01:11:21,489 --> 01:11:24,799
- I still think you're lying, Repp.
- I'm not lying.

656
01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:30,446
I know, you're after
Will Isham's hide.

657
01:11:31,489 --> 01:11:34,003
Why don't you ask him
who shot down Hugh Clagg?

658
01:11:34,129 --> 01:11:36,484
That's what you want
to know, ain't it?

659
01:11:36,569 --> 01:11:40,642
- Isham shot Clagg, ain't that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

660
01:11:42,489 --> 01:11:43,888
All right, boys, thanks.

661
01:12:02,289 --> 01:12:04,359
I must talk to Señor Isham.

662
01:12:09,089 --> 01:12:12,764
I saw your man Repp tell Owen
Merritt how you killed Clagg.

663
01:12:13,009 --> 01:12:14,601
They take Repp to town.

664
01:12:22,489 --> 01:12:24,719
- Can we get to town by dawn?
- Sure.

665
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:27,563
Then we'll beat them
in. Wake up the boys.

666
01:12:47,729 --> 01:12:49,845
- Nan.
- Hello, Laurie.

667
01:12:49,969 --> 01:12:52,881
You were with Owen? I've
been trying to find him.

668
01:12:52,969 --> 01:12:55,358
How did you expect to
do that when Isham can't?

669
01:12:56,489 --> 01:12:59,242
- Owen's all right, then?
- Yes, but he was hurt.

670
01:12:59,489 --> 01:13:01,525
Then why did you leave him?

671
01:13:01,609 --> 01:13:06,080
I'm like your husband in one respect,
Laurie, half of something isn't enough.

672
01:13:07,209 --> 01:13:08,847
Giddap.

673
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:29,246
- Looks like we beat him in.
- We'll see.

674
01:13:29,329 --> 01:13:32,082
- I'll be up at the hotel.
- Put your mind at ease, Mr. Isham.

675
01:13:32,169 --> 01:13:34,637
This is like shooting
crippled ducks in a barrel.

676
01:13:34,889 --> 01:13:37,357
All right, boys, spread
out. Get out of sight.

677
01:13:37,449 --> 01:13:39,917
Gray, put these horses
where they won't be seen.

678
01:13:41,129 --> 01:13:45,486
I smell something in this wind and
sand that's not altogether the weather.

679
01:13:45,649 --> 01:13:46,764
Yeah.

680
01:13:53,969 --> 01:13:56,164
- Howdy, Croker.
- Hi.

681
01:13:57,329 --> 01:13:59,524
Set them up over here.

682
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:01,961
I like the view.

683
01:14:04,889 --> 01:14:07,084
Sure got a lot of nervous
people in this town.

684
01:14:08,609 --> 01:14:10,884
And you're looking at one right now.

685
01:14:23,889 --> 01:14:25,481
So you came here.

686
01:14:27,449 --> 01:14:30,202
Will, why are you in town?

687
01:14:31,489 --> 01:14:34,242
My men have an appointment
to meet someone.

688
01:14:35,129 --> 01:14:36,562
Owen Merritt?

689
01:14:38,329 --> 01:14:41,958
Can't you stop now? Haven't
you done enough to Owen already?

690
01:14:42,049 --> 01:14:43,607
You're giving yourself away, Laurie.

691
01:14:43,689 --> 01:14:46,681
Every time you mention his
name your voice goes soft.

692
01:14:47,809 --> 01:14:50,528
Your imagination makes
you believe anything.

693
01:14:51,209 --> 01:14:53,643
The man who has your heart
has a wonderful thing.

694
01:14:54,769 --> 01:14:56,407
But I haven't got it.

695
01:14:57,129 --> 01:15:00,678
But maybe there's hope for
us yet. Maybe you can change.

696
01:15:01,529 --> 01:15:04,999
Could you keep on loving
a man after he was dead?

697
01:15:54,129 --> 01:15:56,359
- Sheriff.
- Merritt.

698
01:15:57,089 --> 01:15:59,649
- Prine.
- That's us all right, Sheriff.

699
01:16:06,489 --> 01:16:07,842
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

700
01:16:07,929 --> 01:16:10,568
Say, I just saw the funniest
sight going down the street.

701
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:13,368
A whole cart full of Mexicans,
but they weren't Mexicans.

702
01:16:14,289 --> 01:16:17,008
And one of them had on a pair
of fancy boots with spurs.

703
01:16:17,889 --> 01:16:21,564
You know, Prine won them spurs and
boots at a rifle shoot last July.

704
01:16:21,689 --> 01:16:24,806
- How do you know?
- I know 'cause I was in it.

705
01:16:24,889 --> 01:16:26,083
Tried for it myself.

706
01:16:29,169 --> 01:16:31,763
Say, they had your man Repp with them.

707
01:16:32,169 --> 01:16:35,718
Took him into the Sheriff's
office. He was all dressed up, too.

708
01:16:36,489 --> 01:16:37,808
Sign here.

709
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:43,605
I ain't never had nothing against
you, Merritt, so I got to tell you.

710
01:16:43,689 --> 01:16:46,442
Will Isham and that whole
Skull crew is in town.

711
01:16:49,689 --> 01:16:51,566
Looks like them coming.

712
01:16:59,849 --> 01:17:02,283
We know you're in there,
Merritt, so come on out.

713
01:17:02,489 --> 01:17:06,164
- Why don't you come in?
- That's just what we're gonna do.

714
01:17:08,209 --> 01:17:12,361
Don't! If we start that gang shooting,
there'll be a lot of men killed for nothing.

715
01:17:12,449 --> 01:17:13,677
There're too many of them.

716
01:17:13,769 --> 01:17:15,248
- Where's Isham?
- At the hotel.

717
01:17:15,329 --> 01:17:18,127
- Let me out the back way.
- Owen, they'll spot you.

718
01:17:18,209 --> 01:17:19,562
Let them come in when I get out.

719
01:17:19,649 --> 01:17:22,527
Owen, if there's gonna be
gunplay between you and Isham...

720
01:17:22,609 --> 01:17:25,077
there's one thing you've got
to get clear in your head.

721
01:17:25,169 --> 01:17:27,444
If you're thinking of
Laurie, you'll be a dead man.

722
01:17:27,529 --> 01:17:28,803
My mind is clear.

723
01:17:38,169 --> 01:17:40,364
Open that door, or we blow it down.

724
01:17:44,089 --> 01:17:46,045
All right, Dutcher, I'm opening up.

725
01:17:54,889 --> 01:17:56,322
- Where is he?
- Where's who?

726
01:17:56,409 --> 01:17:59,481
Don't give me that. Three of you
came into this building and now...

727
01:17:59,569 --> 01:18:01,161
You might as well quit, Dutcher.

728
01:18:01,249 --> 01:18:03,319
When Merritt gets hold
of Isham at the hotel...

729
01:18:03,409 --> 01:18:05,127
"Isham at the hotel"?

730
01:18:18,529 --> 01:18:20,645
Okay. It's all yours.

731
01:18:24,409 --> 01:18:25,842
Don't do it, Will.

732
01:18:31,249 --> 01:18:33,126
- You're not going to...
- I ought to...

733
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:35,245
the way Fay Dutcher
killed the Vird brothers...

734
01:18:35,329 --> 01:18:37,889
and the way he shot down
Hugh Clagg without a chance.

735
01:18:38,529 --> 01:18:41,202
- Will.
- I don't blame you for killing Clagg.

736
01:18:41,289 --> 01:18:43,883
That I wanted to do
myself. But you did.

737
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:46,039
And Lee Repp's word
can hang you for it.

738
01:18:46,129 --> 01:18:48,324
That I have, already signed.

739
01:18:55,129 --> 01:18:56,448
I wouldn't.

740
01:18:58,529 --> 01:19:01,123
There's a way out, for a price.

741
01:19:02,609 --> 01:19:05,043
If your price is her,
I'll never pay it.

742
01:19:05,289 --> 01:19:08,679
I came to end troubles. Sell
Skull and get out of the country.

743
01:19:08,769 --> 01:19:10,248
Sell out Skull?

744
01:19:11,649 --> 01:19:14,527
Please, Will, let's
do it. Let's go away.

745
01:19:15,409 --> 01:19:18,048
You'd go away with me
after all that's happened?

746
01:19:19,289 --> 01:19:21,200
You're my husband, Will.

747
01:19:21,609 --> 01:19:23,247
I made a bargain.

748
01:19:25,009 --> 01:19:27,079
I almost forgot that once...

749
01:19:28,249 --> 01:19:30,126
but I never will again.

750
01:19:32,329 --> 01:19:33,921
Owen, you've won.

751
01:19:35,289 --> 01:19:36,563
But so have I.

752
01:19:44,929 --> 01:19:45,964
Don't, Dutcher!

753
01:20:02,529 --> 01:20:05,407
You kept your bargain. Thanks.

754
01:20:06,529 --> 01:20:08,087
Skull's yours.

755
01:20:09,449 --> 01:20:10,768
Never sell it.

756
01:20:11,049 --> 01:20:12,767
No, I won't.

757
01:20:17,209 --> 01:20:20,838
By the way, Merritt, I
just quit working for Isham.

758
01:20:20,969 --> 01:20:22,846
We got nothing to fight about anymore.

759
01:20:24,209 --> 01:20:26,439
I've got plenty. Juke and George.

760
01:20:28,329 --> 01:20:30,081
Let her go, Dutcher.

761
01:20:40,849 --> 01:20:43,443
- Owen, don't. Please!
- Stay back.

762
01:21:55,449 --> 01:21:57,041
Hold it, Dutcher.

763
01:21:59,249 --> 01:22:01,683
You wouldn't shoot a man
in the back, would you?

764
01:22:01,769 --> 01:22:02,963
I could you.

765
01:22:11,209 --> 01:22:13,598
I've got no gun. It would be murder.

766
01:22:14,569 --> 01:22:16,719
I was hoping that you'd try your luck.

767
01:22:17,289 --> 01:22:18,881
Head for the Sheriff's office.

768
01:22:34,689 --> 01:22:37,726
You're hurt again.
Won't you ever learn?

769
01:22:38,889 --> 01:22:40,561
You'll have to teach me.
