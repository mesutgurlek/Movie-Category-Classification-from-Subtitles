passing the big trail yesterday.

340
00:51:53,659 --> 00:51:57,213
You know, three riders
and one woman. Mexican.

341
00:51:59,098 --> 00:52:01,122
What time of day yesterday?

342
00:52:01,401 --> 00:52:03,166
Late.

343
00:52:03,266 --> 00:52:05,917
But the sun was still not down.

344
00:52:07,673 --> 00:52:09,392
Huh.

345
00:52:10,409 --> 00:52:13,512
Those Mexicans you... you saw, they...

346
00:52:13,612 --> 00:52:15,830
they took my wife.

347
00:52:16,482 --> 00:52:18,751
They came in the night
and they took her.

348
00:52:18,851 --> 00:52:22,422
Those are awful things
for any man to have to say.

349
00:52:22,522 --> 00:52:25,124
My concern is that those riders

350
00:52:25,224 --> 00:52:27,655
seemed peaceful enough.

351
00:52:28,494 --> 00:52:32,012
But they had the fear of God
in their... eyes.

352
00:52:32,112 --> 00:52:37,956
Look, I'm... I'm sorry to bring stories
of bloodshed and kidnapping to your door.

353
00:52:38,204 --> 00:52:40,873
Those things had to be said.

354
00:52:40,973 --> 00:52:43,025
Those men...

355
00:52:43,776 --> 00:52:46,858
Those men are the worst of their kind.

356
00:52:47,246 --> 00:52:51,017
Why does it strike me
that the last time I saw you...

357
00:52:51,417 --> 00:52:54,220
after some of the things you did
for General Sherman,

358
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,275
the men...

359
00:52:56,375 --> 00:52:59,006
they called you Diablo?

360
00:53:00,359 --> 00:53:02,939
I asked the men what it meant.

361
00:53:03,629 --> 00:53:07,742
And when they told me...
I learned something about you.

362
00:53:08,334 --> 00:53:12,321
No. No, I was just following orders.

363
00:53:13,005 --> 00:53:16,610
I'm a married man
intent on landing my family.

364
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:20,980
You were eventually...
Sherman's best killer,

365
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:25,762
and as I recall, you came
to enjoy life on his trail.

366
00:53:26,652 --> 00:53:28,887
Jackson...

367
00:53:28,987 --> 00:53:32,141
I have a granddaughter in my life here.

368
00:53:33,659 --> 00:53:36,562
I was always kind to you, wasn't I?

369
00:53:36,662 --> 00:53:38,398
Yes.

370
00:53:38,898 --> 00:53:41,550
I don't mince my words.

371
00:53:42,501 --> 00:53:45,004
Why did you come here?

372
00:53:45,104 --> 00:53:47,190
I came to ask for your help.

373
00:53:48,641 --> 00:53:51,930
After all these years,
you're still torturing yourself over...

374
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:54,047
accidentally shooting your brother?

375
00:53:56,849 --> 00:53:59,201
Go home, son.

376
00:53:59,585 --> 00:54:01,837
Leave those people alone.

377
00:54:05,024 --> 00:54:07,476
Oh, I understand.

378
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,881
I fear you haven't been well
since last I seen you.

379
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,927
Once you fetch the water
from that stream,

380
00:54:17,027 --> 00:54:19,521
we'll get you a proper meal.

381
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,142
Then you have to go.

382
00:54:23,242 --> 00:54:25,127
Alright?

383
00:55:02,548 --> 00:55:06,847
Please! You can have anything you want,
but please don't hurt us.

384
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,022
You gonna look at me like that?

385
00:55:10,122 --> 00:55:13,159
All I needed was a little bit
of fucking help from you.

386
00:55:15,094 --> 00:55:17,346
That's all I needed.

387
00:55:21,801 --> 00:55:24,304
Ah, there he is!

00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,640
Our intrepid trail traveler.

389
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,526
I just can't seem to lose you.

390
00:55:31,977 --> 00:55:34,446
Well, what can I say?

391
00:55:34,546 --> 00:55:37,717
- I've become attached.
- Jackson...

392
00:55:37,817 --> 00:55:41,504
stop this insanity right now.

393
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:44,240
Yeah, your fight's with me.

394
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:47,155
My fight is with everybody.

395
00:55:47,493 --> 00:55:49,863
Lovely granddaughter he has in there.

396
00:55:51,063 --> 00:55:53,366
- No.
- Benjamin, how old is she?

397
00:55:53,766 --> 00:55:56,002
Please, just leave my granddaughter
alone. Please.

398
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:57,904
Shhh. Shhh-shhh.

399
00:55:58,004 --> 00:56:02,107
Please, Jackson. I mean you no harm.

400
00:56:02,207 --> 00:56:04,176
I can help you.

401
00:56:04,276 --> 00:56:07,447
Yeah, I... I will go with you...

402
00:56:07,547 --> 00:56:10,015
and bring your wife back.

403
00:56:10,365 --> 00:56:12,851
You had your chance.

404
00:56:15,637 --> 00:56:18,190
Now say your prayers.

- Give us this day our daily bread...

(POUNDING)

508
01:14:28,029 --> 01:14:30,882
You left me no choice.

509
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:36,750
I... I had to have you.

510
01:14:38,706 --> 01:14:40,625
(POUNDING)

511
01:15:03,253 --> 01:15:06,183
If you touch her I will kill you!

512
01:15:09,637 --> 01:15:11,323
You poor man.

513
01:15:41,602 --> 01:15:43,658
(GUNSHOT)

514
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:46,657
No! No! Alexsandra!

515
01:15:50,835 --> 01:15:53,911
I am going to kill you!
I am going to kill you!

516
01:15:55,416 --> 01:15:57,868
Get out of my house.

517
01:15:58,953 --> 01:16:01,443
- Go! Go!
- (CLICKING)

518
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:23,245
No! No! No, please!

519
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:26,432
No, don't! No!

520
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:30,547
Stop! Stop it! No!

521
01:16:33,687 --> 01:16:36,457
Please, he's the father of my children!

522
01:16:36,557 --> 01:16:40,205
- Please don't! Guillermo!
- Alexsandra.

523
01:16:54,147 --> 01:16:57,983
I am not afraid. I am not afraid.

524
01:17:01,922 --> 01:17:03,978
Don't do it.

525
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:09,944
We can stop.

526
01:17:11,089 --> 01:17:13,937
There does not need
to be any more death.

527
01:17:19,033 --> 01:17:21,697
ALEXSANDRA: No! No! (SCREAMING)
