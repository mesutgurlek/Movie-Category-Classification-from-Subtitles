1
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:02,280
Whiskey.

2
00:03:05,284 --> 00:03:07,419
We ain't got
no whiskey.

3
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:12,424
Cold beer.

4
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:14,809
We ain't got
no cold beer.

5
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:18,446
What are they
drinking?

6
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:20,098
Warm beer.

7
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,967
Give me
a warm beer.

8
00:03:39,134 --> 00:03:41,135
How far is it
to tombstone?

9
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:45,673
Hey, cowboy,
how far to tombstone?

10
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,111
Who wants
to know?

11
00:03:58,053 --> 00:03:59,671
Bartender:
This gentleman here.

12
00:03:59,738 --> 00:04:02,974
He want to know
how far to tombstone.

13
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,342
Depends

14
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,478
Whether he can
ride or not.

15
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:11,882
Maybe a day,
maybe three days.

16
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,287
For a dude,
maybe a month.

17
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:28,767
You a gambler,
cowboy?

18
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,702
Yeah.

19
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,071
I gamble, dude.

20
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:37,958
Play you
for the lady.

21
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:41,762
I ain't gonna play
for the lady.

22
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:44,432
Why not?

23
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:47,768
'cause me and her's
in love.

24
00:04:47,836 --> 00:04:51,439
I'm gonna take her out to
the ranch. Have a big wedding.

25
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:56,410
Raise cattle. Live happy ever after.

26
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,381
You're talking cow shit,
ike clanton.

27
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:03,250
Let's play one hand.
Five-card stud.

28
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,121
My horse
against your, uh,

29
00:05:08,523 --> 00:05:09,690
Lady.

30
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,929
You don't
own me, ike.

31
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:19,434
Then let's say
I done rented you.

32
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:23,771
yeah.

33
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,841
Why don't you play the
gentleman for the rent?

34
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:32,663
Sit down, dude.

35
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:35,232
Hey, bring us
some cards.

36
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,035
Bartender: We ain't
got no cards.

37
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,537
I got some cards.

38
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,940
you don't think I'd play
with your cards, do you?

39
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:48,680
Look them over.

40
00:06:05,214 --> 00:06:07,398
I guess
they look okay.

41
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,233
Let's let the lady
cut for deal.

42
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:12,002
She cut for you first,
then for me.

43
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,260
Pair of tens.

44
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,558
You can reach for it
if you want to, cowboy.

45
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,359
But if you do, you're gonna
end up with two assholes,

46
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:18,829
And one of them is gonna
be right between your eyes.

47
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:22,349
Now, get the hell
out of here.

48
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,609
I'll see you
in tombstone, dude.

49
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:51,278
Could be.

50
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:12,516
Got a room?

51
00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:13,851
In there.

52
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:24,278
Let's go.

53
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:32,102
The name's john holliday.
Doc, some people call me.

54
00:09:33,555 --> 00:09:35,706
Kate elder.

55
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:37,241
I'm gonna need
a tub of hot water.

56
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:38,442
We ain't got
no hot water.

57
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,578
God damn it, build a
fire and heat some water!

58
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:45,349
I gotta wash
this bitch.

59
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,790
Where are you
going, dude?

60
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:02,527
Tombstone. I gotta see
somebody there.

61
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:05,513
Woman?

62
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,665
No. A friend.

63
00:11:09,184 --> 00:11:10,717
I'm ready.

64
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,412
This is the ass end
of the west, doc.

65
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:24,648
It ain't even
got a name.

66
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,884
I had a ride to tombstone with
that clanton. At least that far.

67
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,920
You busted that up.
You won me.

68
00:11:28,987 --> 00:11:32,690
Look, lady, where I go, I go
alone. I don't travel with anybody.

69
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,194
Okay.

70
00:11:56,865 --> 00:11:57,965
Let's go.

71
00:12:01,936 --> 00:12:05,873
That's $3.50 you owe me
for the food and the room.

72
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,543
Doc: 3.50?

73
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:13,814
Here's four.
Keep the change.

74
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:32,350
Doc, when are we
gonna get some water?

75
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:35,853
Not till we see the mountains.
We got a long ride yet.

76
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:05,799
Now we can have
some water.

77
00:13:05,867 --> 00:13:07,351
Thank jesus.

78
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:18,628
Son of a bitch.

79
00:13:18,696 --> 00:13:20,931
It's vinegar.
Mexican greaser.

80
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:22,833
Vinegar.

81
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:24,585
Oh, doc.

82
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,670
Come on now, we got to save our energy.

83
00:13:25,737 --> 00:13:27,705
We got a long ride
to those mountains.

84
00:13:28,957 --> 00:13:31,892
Kate: Bastard. Still
fighting the mexican war.

85
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:01,322
doc...

86
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,967
Doc...

87
00:14:50,572 --> 00:14:51,838
it's you.

88
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:58,746
Where are we?

89
00:14:58,813 --> 00:15:00,915
Mountains.

90
00:15:00,982 --> 00:15:02,717
We should be in tombstone
tomorrow afternoon,

91
00:15:02,784 --> 00:15:04,235
If we are
where I think we are.

92
00:15:04,302 --> 00:15:05,852
We got something
to eat?

93
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,173
Well, there's some salt beef and
beans right there next to the fire.

94
00:15:21,302 --> 00:15:23,169
Beans
make you fart.

95
00:15:23,237 --> 00:15:25,872
well,
just stay away from me.

96
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:29,042
Bastard.

97
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:31,912
Whore.

98
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:34,764
Killer.

99
00:15:34,832 --> 00:15:36,550
What do you mean,
"killer"?

100
00:15:36,618 --> 00:15:37,984
I figured you
for a gunfighter

101
00:15:38,052 --> 00:15:41,288
The minute you walked into
that pigsty back there.

102
00:15:41,356 --> 00:15:44,124
The way you walked with your
right hand hanging loose.

103
00:15:44,192 --> 00:15:46,677
The way you looked around
the room like there was

104
00:15:46,744 --> 00:15:49,763
A rattler hiding
in the pickle barrel.

105
00:15:49,831 --> 00:15:51,798
A little baby gun
you keep in your vest.

106
00:15:53,134 --> 00:15:55,336
Been on the line
four years, doc.

107
00:15:55,403 --> 00:15:57,037
Gotta learn something.

108
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:00,791
I ain't killed a man
in a long time.

109
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:04,028
I ain't screwed a man
since I was 12.

110
00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:14,472
You cleaned me up. You
got real doctor's hands.

111
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:15,873
Dentist's.

112
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,641
Dentist?

113
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:19,743
Yeah. I was
a dentist once.

114
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:26,117
What do you
think of that?

115
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,687
Any good?

116
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,506
Well, it's not bad.

117
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,541
Good.

118
00:16:35,944 --> 00:16:37,044
Doc?

119
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:44,117
I ain't never done it
in the mountains before.

120
00:16:44,185 --> 00:16:47,038
Now, look, we gotta start
early in the morning.

121
00:16:47,705 --> 00:16:48,705
Good night.

122
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:51,959
Mean,

123
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,895
Rat-livered,

124
00:16:54,963 --> 00:16:57,698
Heartless,
lonesome creature.

125
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,407
Listen,
katie elder...

126
00:17:07,475 --> 00:17:08,842
What?

127
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,777
If you're gonna break wind,
would you turn the other way?

128
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:13,246
'cause you're aimed right at the
fire, and you might blow us both up,

129
00:17:13,314 --> 00:17:14,982
And I've got to get
to tombstone.

130
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,249
Suck grass.

131
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:19,586
"lonesome. "

132
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:46,029
Straighten up,
woman.

133
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:48,399
You gonna get your picture took, doc?

134
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:49,767
Could be.

135
00:18:17,128 --> 00:18:20,331
Is that your friend, the
one you're looking for?

136
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:22,416
That's probably
the mayor.

137
00:18:23,634 --> 00:18:25,435
Some of your friends?

138
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:30,073
Oh, just a few
working girls, doc.

139
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:32,993
Servants for
the likes of you.

140
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:35,729
She looks like she does most
of her serving with her mouth.

141
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,501
End of the
line, kate.

142
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,010
Much obliged.

143
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,390
See you
around, dude.

144
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,001
Hey, curly. Howdy, pretty lady.

145
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:33,837
You a prospector?
That's right.

146
00:19:33,905 --> 00:19:35,539
Why don't you stick with
me? I'll bring you luck.

147
00:19:36,057 --> 00:19:37,190
Man: New girl in town!

148
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,144
the name's kate.

149
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:43,897
Man: Hey, you staying for a while?

150
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:45,815
Well, if this town's got
any action, I'm staying.

151
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,150
Man: Where are
you going?

152
00:19:47,218 --> 00:19:49,386
Kate: Right across the square.
Come round, the name is kate.

153
00:19:56,978 --> 00:19:58,796
Open up, sisters!

154
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:02,432
Back to work.

155
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,167
I'll need a bottle
of whiskey, a bath

156
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,836
And a place
to put my horse.

157
00:20:05,903 --> 00:20:08,872
I'll have a boy
take care of that.

158
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,407
Do you know
wyatt earp?

159
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,543
The marshal?

160
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,427
Tell him
doc's in town.

161
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:44,178
Hello, wyatt.

162
00:22:44,245 --> 00:22:45,495
Hello, john.

163
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,807
Let's go get a drink.

164
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,879
Five whiskeys
here.

165
00:23:01,946 --> 00:23:06,716
Tonight's the night we teach the
kid how to drink some rye whiskey.

166
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:09,887
Oh, leave the kid alone, ike. He don't
drink whiskey. He don't even like beer.

167
00:23:09,954 --> 00:23:10,954
Johnny ringo.

168
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:12,422
Oh, concha!

169
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,963
Maybe what the kid really needs

170
00:23:20,765 --> 00:23:23,500
Is to get his
pole greased.

171
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:26,804
Me, oh, my!
Fresh meat!

172
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:30,056
That's something concha
knows how to treat good, huh?

173
00:23:30,124 --> 00:23:32,643
Come on, let me see it. Let me see it!

174
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,861
No, concha's not gonna hurt you, baby.

175
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:37,030
concha...

176
00:23:44,188 --> 00:23:47,024
Well, well, well.
Look who's here.

177
00:23:48,276 --> 00:23:49,643
Hello, cowboy.

178
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,636
Hello, dude.

179
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:53,563
Play some cards?

180
00:23:58,285 --> 00:24:00,120
Excuse me,
gentlemen.

181
00:24:05,793 --> 00:24:06,793
Mmm?

182
00:24:07,795 --> 00:24:08,795
Oh.

183
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:14,834
Ike: Son
of a bitch!

184
00:24:14,902 --> 00:24:16,803
Forget it, ike! He's packing and you ain't!

185
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,371
I see
you've met ike.

186
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:52,973
I ran into him.

187
00:24:59,113 --> 00:25:00,463
What's that
all about?

188
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:03,600
Ike, his
brother billy.

189
00:25:04,802 --> 00:25:07,119
Frank mclowery,
his kid brother.

190
00:25:07,154 --> 00:25:11,057
Little guy's johnny ringo. Troublemakers.

191
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:12,392
They trying to make
trouble for you?

192
00:25:12,459 --> 00:25:16,429
For anybody. They're
bad people, john.

193
00:25:17,448 --> 00:25:19,032
Well, if it weren't
for bad people,

194
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,803
What would you do
for a living, marshal?

195
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:26,606
Tell me about tombstone. I mean,
more than what you said in the letter.

196
00:25:26,673 --> 00:25:28,692
It's wide open.

197
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:31,695
The sheriff here,
johnny behan,

198
00:25:31,762 --> 00:25:34,163
Doesn't know how
to organize a town.

199
00:25:34,231 --> 00:25:37,200
So I'm going to run
against him in the election.

200
00:25:37,268 --> 00:25:39,937
The sheriff's got
all the power here.

201
00:25:40,004 --> 00:25:42,522
The marshal's got a badge,
he's got some territory,

202
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,975
But he's got no jurisdiction in the town.

203
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:46,376
Gambling's heavy.

204
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:49,095
There's a lot of money
around. It's wide open.

205
00:25:49,163 --> 00:25:52,249
So you organize the
gambling. Start right here.

206
00:25:52,316 --> 00:25:55,568
I run the law,
you run the gambling.

207
00:25:57,872 --> 00:25:59,306
We'll both
end up rich.

208
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,576
Very rich.

209
00:26:05,213 --> 00:26:07,931
We sound like
bad people, wyatt.

210
00:26:08,866 --> 00:26:10,367
We are, john.

211
00:26:14,004 --> 00:26:15,872
<i>A little game,
companero?</i>

212
00:26:41,465 --> 00:26:44,534
And 10 more.

213
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,831
Man: Whoo!

214
00:27:03,437 --> 00:27:08,507
<i>Ike: Puta! Puta! My
little fort griffin puta!</i>

215
00:27:08,575 --> 00:27:10,009
Hello, ike.

216
00:27:10,078 --> 00:27:10,810
Come back to see old ike, did you?

217
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:12,279
Well, not quite.

218
00:27:12,346 --> 00:27:14,314
Let me see those cheetahs, lovebird.

219
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:17,417
<i>You better get a note from
your ma first, burro brain.</i>

220
00:27:17,485 --> 00:27:19,068
Come here, bitch!

221
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,250
You stay out of this.

222
00:27:34,318 --> 00:27:35,886
Outside.

223
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:38,321
You take off them guns,
get rid of that badge,

224
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:39,556
And I'll see if
you're man enough

225
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:40,857
To take me
outside, earp!

226
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:43,292
Another time,
ike. Move!

227
00:28:07,084 --> 00:28:09,852
Come on! I'm gonna stay a while, ringo.

228
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,221
Okay, but you
watch your ass,

229
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,956
Because that wyatt earp
ain't right in his head.

230
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:33,826
Your five,

231
00:28:35,062 --> 00:28:36,262
And 20 more.

232
00:28:46,056 --> 00:28:47,407
Very impressive.

233
00:28:49,142 --> 00:28:50,176
Plays a nice game.

234
00:28:52,213 --> 00:28:53,663
Nice to see you,
miss kate.

235
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,032
Hello, kid.
How are you?

236
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:13,950
Mr. Earp?

237
00:29:14,952 --> 00:29:16,453
Mr. Holliday.

238
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,293
I'll be right back.

239
00:31:11,151 --> 00:31:13,786
Get him, virgil!
Come on! Get in there!

240
00:31:13,854 --> 00:31:15,455
You got him, boy.
Come on.

241
00:31:15,523 --> 00:31:17,757
Come on. Come on, we've
got people coming in an hour.

242
00:31:17,824 --> 00:31:19,792
Push it. Push it.
You got him.

243
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,893
Come on, let's
straighten up.

244
00:31:20,961 --> 00:31:22,028
Just a little
bit more.

245
00:31:22,095 --> 00:31:25,548
James, virgil, morgan.

246
00:31:27,017 --> 00:31:28,518
Howdy, brother.

247
00:31:28,585 --> 00:31:30,002
We got people coming
in an hour.

248
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:40,963
You know, maybe we should've put
the pigs somewhere else for the day.

249
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:43,182
You mean
virgil and morgan?

250
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:55,595
Let's go
get a drink.

251
00:32:01,968 --> 00:32:03,303
Hi, mark,
how you doing?

252
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,638
Hi, how are you?
Nice to see you.

253
00:32:06,574 --> 00:32:08,558
I'm gonna try.
Thank you.

254
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:11,778
It's not an easy thing to ask a man who's
carried a gun all his life to give it up.

255
00:32:11,845 --> 00:32:15,031
That's pretty much it. Pretty much,
I guess, the way we'll conduct it,

256
00:32:15,098 --> 00:32:17,066
Just getting everybody
around, talking to them.

257
00:32:17,134 --> 00:32:18,951
Excuse my hand.

258
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:21,171
Thank you very much.

259
00:32:21,238 --> 00:32:23,072
He's the fastest, and I'd
say he's the deadliest,

260
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,507
And I'd say he's
about the best.

261
00:32:29,596 --> 00:32:33,099
Boy: All dressed in black,
pa. All in black.

262
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:35,134
That's really
doc holliday?

263
00:32:35,202 --> 00:32:38,737
Man 1: That's him, son. Take
a good look and remember.

264
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:44,860
James, say hello
to john.

265
00:32:44,928 --> 00:32:46,029
Hello, james.

266
00:32:46,096 --> 00:32:47,396
Bless you, doc.

267
00:32:47,464 --> 00:32:49,566
Man 2: I see earp has
brought in the artillery.

268
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:51,050
He sure must want
them clantons bad.

269
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:52,569
Man 3: What
do you mean?

270
00:32:52,636 --> 00:32:54,838
Man 2: I encountered him in dodge.

271
00:32:54,905 --> 00:32:56,939
Him and wyatt killed
a lot of people.

272
00:32:57,007 --> 00:32:58,391
He's wyatt's
heavy guns.

273
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:00,359
Man 3: If holliday's
as good as I hear,

274
00:33:00,427 --> 00:33:03,079
The clantons better start
thinking about moving on.

275
00:33:04,064 --> 00:33:05,331
Mattie?

276
00:33:05,933 --> 00:33:07,167
Hello, mattie.

277
00:33:07,234 --> 00:33:08,718
doc holliday!

278
00:33:17,711 --> 00:33:18,911
Man 4: How old
a man is he?

279
00:33:18,979 --> 00:33:20,730
Man 5: Hard telling.

280
00:33:20,797 --> 00:33:23,366
Talk says he's got the
consumption, had it for years.

281
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,384
Talk says he's
already dying.

282
00:33:25,452 --> 00:33:28,387
Fears no one in a fight 'cause
he's got nothing to lose.

283
00:33:28,422 --> 00:33:30,240
Man 4: Do you
believe the talk?

284
00:33:30,307 --> 00:33:32,174
Till I see
otherwise.

285
00:33:36,513 --> 00:33:39,398
Wyatt: My friend, john
holliday. Sheriff johnny behan.

286
00:33:39,466 --> 00:33:42,035
Doc.
Sheriff.

287
00:33:42,102 --> 00:33:43,269
When you
leaving town?

288
00:33:43,737 --> 00:33:45,421
But try
some of this.

289
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,439
Here's the man who supplied the whiskey.

290
00:33:47,508 --> 00:33:50,676
Owner of the alhambra.
Bartlett, john holliday.

291
00:33:50,744 --> 00:33:53,345
Nice to meet
you, doc.

292
00:33:53,413 --> 00:33:56,032
Just a small campaign
contribution, wyatt.

293
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:58,134
Mattie: Wyatt!

294
00:33:58,201 --> 00:33:59,518
Well, I'll leave you in
his hands for just a second.

295
00:33:59,586 --> 00:34:01,054
Mattie is calling me.
I'll be right back.

296
00:34:01,121 --> 00:34:02,789
Mattie:
Thank you, dear.

297
00:34:02,856 --> 00:34:04,457
Doc, say hello
to mr. Clum,

298
00:34:04,525 --> 00:34:07,710
<i>The editor of the local
newspaper, the tombstone epitaph.</i>

299
00:34:07,777 --> 00:34:10,529
How long you planning
to stay in town?

300
00:34:10,597 --> 00:34:12,482
Well, that depends.

301
00:34:13,316 --> 00:34:15,001
On what?

302
00:34:19,156 --> 00:34:20,423
Excuse me, now.

303
00:34:35,856 --> 00:34:36,923
James.

304
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,091
son of a bitch.

305
00:35:23,403 --> 00:35:25,171
Is there a chinaman
in town?

306
00:35:25,238 --> 00:35:26,706
Yeah, at the end
of allen street.

307
00:35:27,491 --> 00:35:28,807
Thanks.

308
00:35:34,414 --> 00:35:36,015
Good night, sir.

309
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:42,571
Good night, wong.

310
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:45,141
Go with god,
as mexicans say.

311
00:35:46,843 --> 00:35:49,094
I will. I will.

312
00:35:57,771 --> 00:36:00,339
Kid: Mr. Holliday.
Hey!

313
00:36:00,407 --> 00:36:01,323
It's me,
mr. Holliday.

314
00:36:01,391 --> 00:36:03,743
Jesus christ, kid!

315
00:36:05,813 --> 00:36:08,131
You almost got
your head blown off.

316
00:36:08,198 --> 00:36:10,900
Listen, if you're gonna call
a man from the dark like that,

317
00:36:10,967 --> 00:36:13,736
You better plan
on killing him.

318
00:36:13,803 --> 00:36:16,039
Sorry,
mr. Holliday.

319
00:36:16,106 --> 00:36:19,491
My uncles would go crazy if
they saw me talking to you.

320
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:21,510
Who?

321
00:36:21,578 --> 00:36:23,446
Ike and billy
clanton.

322
00:36:23,513 --> 00:36:26,015
They think wyatt earp brought
you into town to kill them.

323
00:36:26,082 --> 00:36:28,284
Listen, kid, you go
tell your uncles

324
00:36:29,419 --> 00:36:32,672
That doc holliday
is a gambler.

325
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,474
I don't kill people
for other people.

326
00:36:36,977 --> 00:36:39,912
There's gonna be
trouble, mr. Holliday.

327
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,847
Not with me
there isn't.

328
00:36:41,915 --> 00:36:44,150
Lots of trouble.

329
00:36:44,217 --> 00:36:47,787
Wyatt don't like
ike clanton, or us.

330
00:36:47,854 --> 00:36:50,690
I ain't sure why, but
there's gonna be bad trouble.

331
00:36:50,757 --> 00:36:53,793
And that's why I came
to see you, mr. Holliday.

332
00:36:55,528 --> 00:36:58,064
I want you to teach me how to shoot.

333
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:03,853
Why?

334
00:37:05,622 --> 00:37:08,724
So you and your uncles
can kill wyatt better?

335
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:09,792
Hmm?

336
00:37:10,527 --> 00:37:11,994
Or me?

337
00:37:12,062 --> 00:37:15,230
Oh, no, mr. Holliday.
I'd never kill you.

338
00:37:18,585 --> 00:37:20,286
Forget about guns.

339
00:37:23,223 --> 00:37:25,991
Ike promised my mother
before she died

340
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,295
That he'd never let me
be a gunfighter.

341
00:37:29,363 --> 00:37:31,531
So if drinking's
all right,

342
00:37:31,598 --> 00:37:33,899
And punching cattle's
all right,

343
00:37:33,967 --> 00:37:35,401
But shooting
ain't...

344
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:39,539
I gotta learn,
mr. Holliday.

345
00:37:42,376 --> 00:37:46,429
Why'd you come after me,
and not somebody else?

346
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,298
'cause they say you're the best there is.

347
00:37:49,449 --> 00:37:52,484
'cause I read all about you in
them dime novels, mr. Holliday.

348
00:37:52,552 --> 00:37:54,420
'cause...

349
00:37:54,487 --> 00:37:55,922
'cause you're
a legend.

350
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,291
All right, kid.

351
00:37:59,325 --> 00:38:01,276
Now, wait...
Hold it, now.

352
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:04,647
Kid, you'd be
dead by now.

353
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:06,382
I mean, fanning's all
right. It's very fast,

354
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,484
But it's not
very accurate.

355
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:10,820
And accuracy is much
more important than speed.

356
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,625
You see,
the important thing is

357
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,326
To get your arm
all the way out,

358
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:19,796
So you have the target
right in your sights.

359
00:38:19,863 --> 00:38:21,497
That's important.

360
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,633
And the other important thing is
to relax, so you can concentrate.

361
00:38:28,922 --> 00:38:30,340
Okay.

362
00:38:30,407 --> 00:38:32,091
Take your time.

363
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:34,043
That's good!
That's real good!

364
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:37,780
Nice shot.

365
00:38:39,416 --> 00:38:40,950
Let's go home.

366
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,622
You know, sometimes I feel
like a goddamn school teacher.

367
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,958
Who taught you,
mr. Holliday?

368
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:50,492
My daddy.

369
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:51,928
Is he still alive?

370
00:38:51,995 --> 00:38:53,763
No, no.

371
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,932
He went off
to fight in the war.

372
00:38:55,999 --> 00:38:58,801
When they lost, that just about killed him.

373
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,937
By the time he got home,
everything he knew was gone,

374
00:39:01,004 --> 00:39:02,672
Including me.

375
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:04,106
Where did you go?

376
00:39:04,174 --> 00:39:06,475
Oh, I went up
to richmond first.

377
00:39:07,277 --> 00:39:09,411
Then to baltimore.

378
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:12,582
My mother sent me up
there to get an education.

379
00:39:15,552 --> 00:39:17,302
Do you, uh...

380
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:18,370
Sure.

381
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:25,961
Yeah, I studied
dentistry up there.

382
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:30,749
And then they told me that
I had to come to the west.

383
00:39:30,818 --> 00:39:33,268
The doctors.
For my health.

384
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:42,662
After that, I ended up at fort griffin,

385
00:39:42,729 --> 00:39:44,497
Then went
to dodge.

386
00:39:45,732 --> 00:39:47,500
I've been all over.

387
00:39:50,704 --> 00:39:52,104
D'you ever
go home?

388
00:39:52,172 --> 00:39:53,606
every night.

389
00:40:24,604 --> 00:40:27,039
Pistol-whip anybody
today, marshal?

390
00:40:35,648 --> 00:40:37,717
Don't try me, ike.

391
00:40:53,133 --> 00:40:54,767
One of these days,

392
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,205
I'm gonna have
to try mr. Earp.

393
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:08,564
Well, hello, dude.
You want to dance?

394
00:41:08,631 --> 00:41:09,598
Man: Let's go.

395
00:41:15,672 --> 00:41:16,873
God!

396
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,187
What time
you got, bartlett?

397
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,294
Just after 2:00.

398
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,488
Doc: Kate!
Where the hell is kate?

399
00:42:56,556 --> 00:42:57,789
She's working.

400
00:42:57,857 --> 00:42:59,824
Kate! Quiet! You'll wake the dead!

401
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:01,660
Kate!

402
00:43:03,096 --> 00:43:04,563
excuse me, sir.

403
00:43:04,631 --> 00:43:05,631
Come on, bitch,
get off your back.

404
00:43:05,699 --> 00:43:07,132
What the hell
are you doing,

405
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,501
You son of a bitch? You're coming with me!

406
00:43:08,568 --> 00:43:11,136
You crazy son of a bitch!
You put me down!

407
00:43:11,204 --> 00:43:12,838
Take it easy.
Take it easy, now.

408
00:43:12,906 --> 00:43:16,041
You... You crazy
son of a bitch!

409
00:43:16,109 --> 00:43:18,344
That's right.
Come on, old girl.

410
00:43:18,411 --> 00:43:20,479
No... I ain't got no
clothes on! I can't go...

411
00:43:20,546 --> 00:43:23,081
Can't go down the street
with no clothes on!

412
00:43:23,149 --> 00:43:26,418
Concha! Concha, get the law after this...

413
00:43:26,486 --> 00:43:29,255
You crazy son of a bitch, put me down!

414
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:34,793
Concha, I love you!
Good luck, darling.

415
00:43:34,861 --> 00:43:37,096
Doc holliday,
you bastard!

416
00:43:46,973 --> 00:43:49,575
What the hell
is this?

417
00:43:49,642 --> 00:43:52,811
You're off the line, kate.
I just retired you.

418
00:43:57,451 --> 00:43:58,884
I'll see you
in the morning.

419
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,211
Good morning.

420
00:44:12,832 --> 00:44:14,282
Good morning.

421
00:44:19,472 --> 00:44:21,073
This is for you.

422
00:44:51,137 --> 00:44:53,188
What's... What's the
matter? Don't you like it?

423
00:44:56,459 --> 00:44:58,026
It's beautiful.

424
00:45:03,432 --> 00:45:05,000
it's beautiful.

425
00:45:09,372 --> 00:45:11,706
You like it?
You really like it?

426
00:45:13,376 --> 00:45:14,743
I love it.

427
00:45:22,669 --> 00:45:24,519
Come on, put it on.

428
00:45:25,021 --> 00:45:26,454
Okay.

429
00:45:26,522 --> 00:45:28,223
Um,

430
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:29,992
I better take
a bath first.

431
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,363
Well, hurry up,
though, 'cause

432
00:45:36,666 --> 00:45:38,533
We got places to go.

433
00:45:42,939 --> 00:45:44,757
Wyatt: What do
you think?

434
00:45:45,658 --> 00:45:47,943
I like it.

435
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:50,179
Okay, take it over
to the printer.

436
00:46:02,792 --> 00:46:05,911
Morning.
Morning, wyatt.

437
00:46:05,978 --> 00:46:08,347
Katie.
Morning, wyatt.

438
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:11,250
Come on.

439
00:46:50,323 --> 00:46:51,456
Well,

440
00:46:55,695 --> 00:46:57,896
Here it is.

441
00:46:57,963 --> 00:47:00,031
Territorial prison in yuma
wouldn't suit us better.

442
00:47:01,701 --> 00:47:05,170
Now, listen, a man's home is his castle.

443
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,274
Shit.
Come on.

444
00:47:08,341 --> 00:47:09,341
Let's go inside.

445
00:47:12,445 --> 00:47:13,645
Wait a minute.

446
00:47:13,713 --> 00:47:14,746
Uh...

447
00:47:14,814 --> 00:47:15,947
Uh, no, no.

448
00:47:16,015 --> 00:47:17,416
Katie, wait, wait...
We got to do this right.

449
00:47:17,483 --> 00:47:18,767
Somebody's going
to see us, kate! Wait...

450
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:20,802
that's
for backing out!

451
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:22,871
What if somebody
would have seen us? What...

452
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:26,575
Nice!

453
00:47:29,145 --> 00:47:31,313
That son of a bitch.

454
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:32,514
What?

455
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,485
What's the
matter, doc?

456
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,288
The man who rented
this place to me

457
00:47:39,355 --> 00:47:41,390
Promised he'd have it
cleaned before we moved in.

458
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:44,326
Well, clean, that's
the least of our...

459
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:46,595
We can have this place
cleaned in an hour, doc,

460
00:47:46,662 --> 00:47:48,330
I mean, that's not a
problem. How's the bed?

461
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:49,498
Mmm.

462
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:50,599
It's a good bed.

463
00:47:50,666 --> 00:47:52,934
Yeah.
Sturdy. Yeah.

464
00:47:53,002 --> 00:47:55,003
It's big enough
for a midget.

465
00:47:55,071 --> 00:47:57,206
you're
pretty skinny, dude.

466
00:47:59,442 --> 00:48:00,709
Look at this place.
It's a mess!

467
00:48:00,776 --> 00:48:03,412
Get some curtains up here,
get this window fixed,

468
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,181
It's all right.

469
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:06,882
And we got a table.

470
00:48:08,668 --> 00:48:10,652
I'm sorry, kate.

471
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:13,138
I should have looked at the
place before I signed the deal.

472
00:48:14,841 --> 00:48:15,941
Doc.

473
00:48:18,444 --> 00:48:20,212
It's gonna be fine.

474
00:48:52,311 --> 00:48:53,612
Wyatt: John?

475
00:48:54,881 --> 00:48:55,948
he's asleep.

476
00:48:56,015 --> 00:48:58,350
Will you wake him up,
please? It's important.

477
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:06,691
doc holliday?

478
00:49:06,759 --> 00:49:08,026
Mmm-hmm?

479
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,535
Your friend wyatt's
at the door.

480
00:49:17,036 --> 00:49:18,270
I know.

481
00:49:20,073 --> 00:49:21,907
Get up.

482
00:49:21,974 --> 00:49:24,042
Just a second, wyatt,
be right there.

483
00:49:29,048 --> 00:49:30,566
Wyatt.

484
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:32,850
Someone held up the stage.
Got the gold shipment.

485
00:49:32,918 --> 00:49:34,669
$80,000.

486
00:49:34,737 --> 00:49:35,804
Eighty...

487
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:37,172
Want to go
after them?

488
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:40,342
I'll be right
with you.

489
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,029
Darling?
Yeah?

490
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,833
Can you give
me a hand?

491
00:49:48,535 --> 00:49:49,701
Sure.

492
00:49:50,269 --> 00:49:51,920
I've got to go.

493
00:49:53,206 --> 00:49:54,339
Okay.

494
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:59,144
You don't mind,
do you?

495
00:50:01,147 --> 00:50:02,214
No. I...

496
00:50:23,552 --> 00:50:27,105
Tracks southwest, toward
the clanton spread.

497
00:50:28,391 --> 00:50:29,992
Ike clanton?

498
00:50:30,059 --> 00:50:31,994
It wouldn't be
ike clanton.

499
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:33,561
More likely
johnny ringo.

500
00:50:50,713 --> 00:50:51,813
Billy: What the hell's
happening, kid?

501
00:50:51,881 --> 00:50:53,215
Trouble, by the look of it.

502
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:54,482
Ike!

503
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:06,211
God damn it, ike,
what'd you do that for?

504
00:51:06,279 --> 00:51:07,312
Ringo!

505
00:51:09,148 --> 00:51:11,182
Where is that half-breed
son of a bitch?

506
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,384
Ain't seen him
in a couple of days.

507
00:51:12,451 --> 00:51:14,736
Might be down in the
valley with the herd. Why?

508
00:51:14,804 --> 00:51:16,905
'cause somebody held up the
gold shipment, that's why.

509
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:19,641
For $80,000,
that's why!

510
00:51:19,708 --> 00:51:22,444
And sure as shit the law's gonna
be coming out here looking for us!

511
00:51:22,511 --> 00:51:24,645
That's why!

512
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,964
Well, get off your asses and find him!

513
00:51:28,801 --> 00:51:30,501
Hey, ike?

514
00:51:30,569 --> 00:51:33,805
Got a couple of visitors,
way down in the draw.

515
00:51:43,582 --> 00:51:45,250
Well, get
out of sight!

516
00:51:45,317 --> 00:51:47,853
Get guns. Get hid.
Give me your gun.

517
00:51:59,098 --> 00:52:01,633
I don't like it.
Mmm-hmm.

518
00:52:46,195 --> 00:52:49,030
I'm gonna give you
fair warning, marshal.

519
00:52:54,169 --> 00:52:57,171
Get off
of my ranch.

520
00:52:57,239 --> 00:52:59,640
Looking for some
wells fargo gold,

521
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:02,210
And the man
who stole it.

522
00:53:02,278 --> 00:53:05,513
Nobody here had anything
to do with that gold.

523
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:09,050
Now, we don't steal money.

524
00:53:12,505 --> 00:53:14,339
Where's
johnny ringo?

525
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:17,342
I ain't seen him.

526
00:53:19,645 --> 00:53:21,213
You're a liar,
ike.

527
00:53:42,051 --> 00:53:44,268
A little different,
ain't it?

528
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:02,671
Marshal.

529
00:54:05,074 --> 00:54:06,775
I'm gonna try you.

530
00:55:00,579 --> 00:55:03,698
you ain't so much
without them guns,

531
00:55:03,765 --> 00:55:05,167
Are you, earp?

532
00:55:08,971 --> 00:55:10,938
You ain't shit.

533
00:55:14,493 --> 00:55:16,044
That's enough, ike!

534
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:17,345
I ain't finished!

535
00:55:20,249 --> 00:55:21,516
He is.

536
00:55:26,605 --> 00:55:28,139
Get him the hell
out of here.

537
00:56:11,684 --> 00:56:13,351
I'm gonna kill him.

538
00:56:15,771 --> 00:56:17,439
Let it go, wyatt.

539
00:56:20,726 --> 00:56:22,460
I'm gonna have
to kill him.

540
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:25,429
Forget it, wyatt,
it's over.

541
00:56:28,851 --> 00:56:30,485
I'm gonna
kill him, john.

542
00:56:31,636 --> 00:56:33,488
Where in the hell
you been, brother?

543
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:36,007
We thought
you was bushwhacked.

544
00:56:36,075 --> 00:56:37,942
Morgan: Glad
you're back, wyatt.

545
00:56:38,177 --> 00:56:41,897
Wells fargo offered a $20,000
reward for the holdup men.

546
00:56:43,182 --> 00:56:45,816
Is that right?
Morgan: $20,000.

547
00:56:47,686 --> 00:56:48,786
Yeah.

548
00:56:51,257 --> 00:56:53,725
You go in and get us something to eat.

549
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:55,927
I'm hungry.

550
00:57:07,156 --> 00:57:08,190
Want something
to eat?

551
00:57:08,841 --> 00:57:10,625
I better go home

552
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:11,693
To kate.

553
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:26,224
James.

554
00:57:30,863 --> 00:57:32,097
Virgil?

555
00:57:32,698 --> 00:57:33,831
Yeah?

556
00:57:34,901 --> 00:57:37,235
Is ike clanton
in town?

557
00:57:37,303 --> 00:57:39,888
He's down at alhambra
right this minute.

558
00:57:39,955 --> 00:57:42,624
Tell him
I want to see him.

559
00:57:42,691 --> 00:57:45,793
Tell him I want to make
a deal with him.

560
00:57:45,861 --> 00:57:47,562
What kind of deal?

561
00:57:50,098 --> 00:57:52,266
Ike didn't hold up
the stage.

562
00:57:53,201 --> 00:57:54,769
It's johnny ringo.

563
00:57:56,204 --> 00:57:57,605
I want him.

564
00:57:59,141 --> 00:58:03,177
You tell ike if he can
lead us to where ringo is,

565
00:58:03,245 --> 00:58:05,179
He can have
the reward.

566
00:58:06,582 --> 00:58:08,282
What the hell for?

567
00:58:10,152 --> 00:58:11,853
Ike gets the money,

568
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:14,622
We get the credit,

569
00:58:15,323 --> 00:58:18,026
We get the election.

570
00:58:18,093 --> 00:58:20,261
Then we'll clean up
tombstone.

571
00:58:21,363 --> 00:58:23,598
You mean clean out tombstone.

572
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,245
Go see clanton.

573
00:58:43,485 --> 00:58:44,869
hello.

574
00:59:03,171 --> 00:59:04,906
My god.

575
00:59:06,225 --> 00:59:08,059
You like it,
flat ass?

576
00:59:10,462 --> 00:59:12,730
Yes. I like it.

577
00:59:19,538 --> 00:59:21,339
I got you a present.

578
00:59:27,329 --> 00:59:28,579
For me?

579
00:59:28,647 --> 00:59:30,431
It's a nightshirt.

580
00:59:31,867 --> 00:59:33,334
What's it...

581
00:59:36,204 --> 00:59:38,840
Um, special occasions?

582
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,742
you sweet bitch.

583
01:00:00,212 --> 01:00:01,362
Come on,
break it up.

584
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:03,231
Man: Who the hell
are you?

585
01:00:03,298 --> 01:00:06,584
I'm the marshal. You
boys are going to jail.

586
01:00:06,652 --> 01:00:07,802
Hell we are!

587
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:12,707
Pick up your friend.
Let's go.

588
01:00:21,167 --> 01:00:24,385
Wyatt. Starting to take the easy ones?

589
01:00:26,955 --> 01:00:29,523
Kate: How did you get
to be a gambler, doc?

590
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:37,198
Just something I picked up along the way,

591
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,334
Like everything else.

592
01:00:42,938 --> 01:00:45,206
How did you end up
on the line?

593
01:00:46,374 --> 01:00:49,410
I was born to it.

594
01:00:49,478 --> 01:00:51,979
You mean, working girls are born, not made?

595
01:00:52,047 --> 01:00:53,931
no.

596
01:00:53,999 --> 01:00:57,501
Nothing fancy. My ma was a whore, is all.

597
01:01:00,705 --> 01:01:02,973
Did you ever meet
your father?

598
01:01:05,677 --> 01:01:07,145
I don't think so.

599
01:01:07,212 --> 01:01:09,347
You don't think so?

600
01:01:09,414 --> 01:01:13,317
No, my ma said before
she died he was a cowboy.

601
01:01:13,385 --> 01:01:16,170
I rolled around
with a lot of cowboys.

602
01:01:28,784 --> 01:01:31,118
Afternoon, doc.

603
01:01:31,186 --> 01:01:32,987
Afternoon, mr. Clum.

604
01:01:39,678 --> 01:01:41,379
Going to the big
debate tonight?

605
01:01:42,247 --> 01:01:43,764
I haven't really
thought about it.

606
01:01:45,684 --> 01:01:47,885
Tell me, uh,

607
01:01:47,953 --> 01:01:50,855
Why do you think wyatt wants
to be sheriff of tombstone?

608
01:01:50,922 --> 01:01:54,242
He's already deputy marshal
of the whole territory.

609
01:01:55,811 --> 01:01:57,078
You tell me.

610
01:01:57,863 --> 01:01:59,230
Money?

611
01:02:00,665 --> 01:02:04,568
How come johnny behan
isn't a rich man?

612
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:07,388
He's dumb.

613
01:02:08,056 --> 01:02:09,757
He's honest.

614
01:02:09,825 --> 01:02:11,309
You don't think
wyatt's honest?

615
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:14,228
Nope.

616
01:02:25,056 --> 01:02:26,056
Oh, no.

617
01:02:27,225 --> 01:02:28,693
What are you doing? He
was pushing me around!

618
01:02:28,728 --> 01:02:29,827
What are
you doing?

619
01:02:32,097 --> 01:02:33,431
Give me
that gun, boy.

620
01:02:33,498 --> 01:02:36,067
Tim mccoy, marshal.
He drew on the kid.

621
01:02:36,134 --> 01:02:38,536
We'll let a jury
decide that. Now, move.

622
01:02:38,604 --> 01:02:40,804
Come on, move!
Easy, wyatt!

623
01:02:49,915 --> 01:02:51,282
All right,
marshal, I'll...

624
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:52,583
I'll take care
of it.

625
01:02:54,786 --> 01:02:56,487
I'll take
his gun.

626
01:03:12,354 --> 01:03:14,188
Miss elder?

627
01:03:14,256 --> 01:03:16,257
Hello, alley.

628
01:03:16,324 --> 01:03:17,925
Um, come on in.

629
01:03:17,993 --> 01:03:19,576
No, thank you.

630
01:03:19,644 --> 01:03:21,496
What can I do
for you, then?

631
01:03:24,666 --> 01:03:27,434
Have you ever thought
of going to church?

632
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:32,272
Not lately. Why?

633
01:03:33,441 --> 01:03:35,843
Well, we would like
to see you go to church

634
01:03:35,911 --> 01:03:37,512
At least once,
miss elder.

635
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:40,114
To get married.

636
01:03:40,816 --> 01:03:41,899
Alley,

637
01:03:43,168 --> 01:03:45,002
When I want preaching,

638
01:03:46,371 --> 01:03:47,938
I'll go to church.

639
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:51,309
But for the moment,

640
01:03:51,376 --> 01:03:53,877
When I'm on my knees,

641
01:03:53,945 --> 01:03:55,746
It ain't in prayer.

642
01:03:59,034 --> 01:04:02,487
We've all got stakes
in tombstone.

643
01:04:02,554 --> 01:04:06,407
We'll be here when all the
others have gone on through.

644
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:10,477
So it's up to us to work
together for a better town,

645
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:13,130
And a better future.

646
01:04:14,532 --> 01:04:15,599
Thank you.

647
01:04:23,908 --> 01:04:25,776
Good evening,
bartlett.

648
01:04:25,844 --> 01:04:26,944
Hi, doc.

649
01:04:29,297 --> 01:04:31,499
All this politicking's
gonna ruin my business.

650
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:35,536
Now, I guess I've got to
make something very clear.

651
01:04:35,604 --> 01:04:38,906
And that is that I'm in tombstone to stay.

652
01:04:38,974 --> 01:04:41,376
I think all of us here want to stay.

653
01:04:41,443 --> 01:04:44,479
I think we all want the
town to have a future.

654
01:04:44,546 --> 01:04:47,615
But it can't have a
future unless it prospers.

655
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:50,618
And it can't prosper with
gunplay in the streets.

656
01:04:51,936 --> 01:04:55,106
Now, there's only one way
to get rid of the gun.

657
01:04:55,173 --> 01:04:57,008
And that's
to use the gun.

658
01:04:58,043 --> 01:04:59,810
The law's gotta
be enforced.

659
01:05:03,548 --> 01:05:05,983
But I hope you'll let me
get the job done for us,

660
01:05:07,185 --> 01:05:08,836
For all
our families.

661
01:05:11,956 --> 01:05:13,224
That's all.

662
01:05:14,993 --> 01:05:17,028
I hope you all
get home safe.

663
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:19,613
Wyatt: Thank you.

664
01:05:30,492 --> 01:05:33,110
What did you think
of the speaking, mr. Clum?

665
01:05:33,812 --> 01:05:35,245
Not bad,

666
01:05:35,313 --> 01:05:38,048
For patent medicine.

667
01:05:38,116 --> 01:05:41,118
You know, mr. Clum,
I'm not a politician.

668
01:05:43,288 --> 01:05:44,722
I'm a peace officer.

669
01:05:46,257 --> 01:05:49,827
I think I know what
doc's after, marshal.

670
01:05:51,563 --> 01:05:53,014
What do you want?

671
01:05:54,766 --> 01:05:56,968
I want to win,
mr. Clum.

672
01:05:59,804 --> 01:06:01,439
Good night,
marshal.

673
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:04,509
Mr. Clum?
Yes?

674
01:06:05,611 --> 01:06:07,462
What do you think
it is

675
01:06:08,914 --> 01:06:10,414
The doc's after?

676
01:06:13,152 --> 01:06:14,485
I'd say, uh,

677
01:06:15,053 --> 01:06:16,220
Size,

678
01:06:17,256 --> 01:06:18,256
Some, uh,

679
01:06:20,025 --> 01:06:22,160
Wild and permanent
gesture of, uh,

680
01:06:23,461 --> 01:06:24,812
Size.

681
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,914
Wyatt: You're taking too long, ike.

682
01:06:26,981 --> 01:06:29,433
I need ringo
before the election.

683
01:06:29,584 --> 01:06:31,219
Suppose I change
my mind?

684
01:06:31,286 --> 01:06:32,720
You made a deal, ike.

685
01:06:32,787 --> 01:06:37,491
That's right. I get 20,000, you
get ringo, you get to be sheriff,

686
01:06:40,095 --> 01:06:41,962
And I get to be dead?

687
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:47,568
You want my ass
all the way, earp,

688
01:06:47,636 --> 01:06:50,888
And I don't figure it's worth
20,000 for me to help you.

689
01:06:50,955 --> 01:06:52,857
You've gotta
deliver, ike.

690
01:06:52,924 --> 01:06:54,525
I ain't gotta do shit.

691
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:56,277
I've got the kid
in jail.

692
01:06:56,961 --> 01:06:59,363
He killed a man
this afternoon.

693
01:06:59,431 --> 01:07:00,948
You're a liar!

694
01:07:04,686 --> 01:07:06,020
Frank?

695
01:07:08,489 --> 01:07:09,857
Where's the kid?

696
01:07:10,391 --> 01:07:11,391
Huh?

697
01:07:14,295 --> 01:07:15,462
I don't know.

698
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:20,551
You miserable
son of a bitch.

699
01:07:20,618 --> 01:07:22,186
You deliver
ringo, ike.

700
01:07:22,888 --> 01:07:24,288
Before
the election.

701
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:28,041
You'll get him.

702
01:07:40,572 --> 01:07:42,707
It sure makes you
sleep good at night,

703
01:07:44,509 --> 01:07:47,377
Knowing wyatt earp's
upholding the law, don't it?

704
01:07:48,881 --> 01:07:51,115
Gotta put at least 1,000 on him, doc.

705
01:07:53,368 --> 01:07:54,936
I think I can
cover that.

706
01:07:55,003 --> 01:07:56,353
What do you want
to bail him out for?

707
01:07:58,006 --> 01:08:01,075
Oh, just a sense of
civic responsibility.

708
01:08:03,845 --> 01:08:05,913
I want him back in three
weeks for the trial.

709
01:08:07,916 --> 01:08:09,933
Now, level
with me, kid.

710
01:08:10,001 --> 01:08:11,402
Why'd you
kill him?

711
01:08:11,469 --> 01:08:12,869
He drew on me.

712
01:08:12,904 --> 01:08:15,689
He had a wife and two
kids. Did you know that?

713
01:08:16,641 --> 01:08:17,725
No.

714
01:08:21,246 --> 01:08:22,797
How old are you?

715
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:24,065
I'm 18.

716
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:27,417
What are you gonna do
with your life?

717
01:08:30,388 --> 01:08:31,889
Don't you have
any ambition?

718
01:08:31,957 --> 01:08:33,557
Yes, mr. Holliday.

719
01:08:33,625 --> 01:08:34,925
What is it?

720
01:08:36,461 --> 01:08:38,012
I want to be
like you.

721
01:08:46,638 --> 01:08:48,438
Get the hell
out of here, kid.

722
01:08:53,528 --> 01:08:55,028
Hello, bones.

723
01:08:55,096 --> 01:08:56,764
Hello, bitch.

724
01:09:10,528 --> 01:09:12,429
Did you have
a good day?

725
01:09:13,932 --> 01:09:15,733
I had a visitor.

726
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,750
Who?

727
01:09:16,818 --> 01:09:18,552
Mrs. Alley earp.

728
01:09:23,991 --> 01:09:26,059
We had a talk
about, um,

729
01:09:26,127 --> 01:09:28,362
The respectable people
of tombstone,

730
01:09:29,931 --> 01:09:32,165
About how you and me are
living in a state of sin.

731
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:35,286
you should
have been here.

732
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:43,211
You know,

733
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:47,815
I sat around here
after she left,

734
01:09:47,883 --> 01:09:51,335
Thinking about what
we're doing together,

735
01:09:51,402 --> 01:09:53,187
Where we're going.

736
01:09:54,956 --> 01:09:56,357
See, doc,

737
01:09:57,558 --> 01:09:59,626
I never was ashamed
of what I was before.

738
01:10:00,195 --> 01:10:01,195
My life then.

739
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:04,198
I liked it, doc.

740
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:08,168
I liked the money first.

741
01:10:08,236 --> 01:10:10,204
But I liked
the life most.

742
01:10:11,873 --> 01:10:14,375
I didn't want
to be some

743
01:10:14,442 --> 01:10:17,912
Nester's wife stuck out
on the goddamn prairie.

744
01:10:17,979 --> 01:10:21,715
Coming in at night smelling of
sheep, reading the bible, I...

745
01:10:22,884 --> 01:10:25,035
What are you
driving at?

746
01:10:25,103 --> 01:10:27,154
I wanted
the towns, doc.

747
01:10:27,222 --> 01:10:29,856
I wanted lights,

748
01:10:29,924 --> 01:10:31,625
Music,

749
01:10:31,693 --> 01:10:33,194
Dancing.

750
01:10:35,763 --> 01:10:37,331
On the line, I got 'em.

751
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:42,303
And I got a lot of other
things. A lot of 'em was bad.

752
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:46,006
But what was good...

753
01:10:49,577 --> 01:10:51,044
After I met you,

754
01:10:54,232 --> 01:10:56,433
I didn't want that life.

755
01:10:56,501 --> 01:10:57,935
What do you want now?

756
01:11:01,089 --> 01:11:02,756
I want to go away

757
01:11:03,191 --> 01:11:04,424
With you.

758
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:10,965
Away from this place,

759
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:18,538
For however many years
you got left.

760
01:11:25,246 --> 01:11:27,081
I want to have a child.

761
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:37,858
Nothing...

762
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:40,127
Nothing fancy, doc.

763
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:50,137
What...

764
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:54,792
what do you want?

765
01:11:56,294 --> 01:11:57,661
I don't know.

766
01:12:02,433 --> 01:12:04,835
Part of me wants
the same things,

767
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:07,971
And part of me wants

768
01:12:10,658 --> 01:12:11,992
Something else.

769
01:12:15,113 --> 01:12:16,747
What?

770
01:12:20,752 --> 01:12:22,753
What "something else"?

771
01:12:25,306 --> 01:12:26,607
What?

772
01:12:28,209 --> 01:12:30,611
Doc,

773
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:34,482
I don't care for however
many years you've got left.

774
01:12:35,917 --> 01:12:37,651
Take now.

775
01:12:37,719 --> 01:12:39,854
Take me! Take

776
01:12:40,655 --> 01:12:42,222
love

777
01:12:43,658 --> 01:12:45,493
For as long
as you've got.

778
01:12:48,029 --> 01:12:50,047
Doc, wait a...
Please don't.

779
01:12:50,114 --> 01:12:52,949
Please don't go,
doc. Please. Doc!

780
01:12:54,952 --> 01:12:56,620
What is it,
virgil?

781
01:12:56,687 --> 01:12:59,490
Doc holliday bailed out the kid, wyatt.

782
01:12:59,557 --> 01:13:01,625
Put up $1,000
cash money.

783
01:13:16,941 --> 01:13:18,008
When?

784
01:13:18,076 --> 01:13:19,343
Last night.

785
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:30,720
Well,

786
01:13:32,991 --> 01:13:35,225
That ruins
the deal, virgil.

787
01:13:35,293 --> 01:13:36,727
I know.

788
01:13:38,513 --> 01:13:40,497
What we gonna
do, wyatt?

789
01:13:43,968 --> 01:13:45,402
Kill the clantons.

790
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:51,408
Katie,
where's john?

791
01:13:51,475 --> 01:13:52,609
He ain't home.

792
01:13:53,611 --> 01:13:55,345
Tell him I want
to see him.

793
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:58,231
Why should I, wyatt?

794
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:01,068
Look, we better get
something straight, katie.

795
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:03,553
You don't own
john holliday.

796
01:14:03,621 --> 01:14:05,806
You got no rights whatever
when it comes to him.

797
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:07,774
And I'll tell
you something,

798
01:14:07,842 --> 01:14:10,377
Ever since you
hooked on to him,

799
01:14:10,444 --> 01:14:12,145
He ain't
been himself.

800
01:14:12,997 --> 01:14:15,182
Maybe he grew up.

801
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:16,900
Yeah, maybe.

802
01:14:16,968 --> 01:14:20,270
Maybe the tricks you learned
on the line got him so tired

803
01:14:20,338 --> 01:14:21,922
That he can't
think straight.

804
01:14:58,809 --> 01:15:00,110
All night?

805
01:15:51,045 --> 01:15:52,412
You bailed out
the kid.

806
01:15:53,464 --> 01:15:54,547
Yeah.

807
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:58,618
Caused
some trouble.

808
01:15:59,771 --> 01:16:01,772
Trouble with
the clantons.

809
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:04,607
Trouble with
the clantons

810
01:16:05,509 --> 01:16:06,743
Is your trouble,

811
01:16:08,046 --> 01:16:09,312
Not mine.

812
01:16:10,515 --> 01:16:12,316
You know, you've
changed, wyatt.

813
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:16,837
I don't understand
you anymore.

814
01:16:18,506 --> 01:16:20,423
You don't
understand me?

815
01:16:22,393 --> 01:16:23,727
I've changed.

816
01:16:24,896 --> 01:16:26,529
I don't understand you.

817
01:16:30,534 --> 01:16:32,569
You know,
there was a time

818
01:16:34,538 --> 01:16:36,406
When my trouble
was your trouble,

819
01:16:37,909 --> 01:16:39,759
And yours
was mine.

820
01:16:41,496 --> 01:16:43,163
Times have changed.

821
01:16:44,699 --> 01:16:45,899
It's different.

822
01:16:47,535 --> 01:16:49,970
It's different, wyatt.
And I'll tell you why.

823
01:16:50,038 --> 01:16:53,140
Because I got
to learn something.

824
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:56,310
I got to learn that I'm not
going to live forever.

825
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:58,145
And I got to learn
that I...

826
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:00,514
I'm sick and tired
of killing.

827
01:17:01,716 --> 01:17:03,083
I'm sick of it.

828
01:17:04,919 --> 01:17:10,391
I'm sick of seeing young kids gun
down old men for bullshit reasons.

829
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:11,791
I don't want that
anymore, wyatt.

830
01:17:11,859 --> 01:17:15,195
It doesn't make any sense
to me. I don't understand it.

831
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:17,297
And I wanna...

832
01:17:19,317 --> 01:17:22,135
I wanna leave
something behind, wyatt.

833
01:17:30,011 --> 01:17:31,745
I want to live.

834
01:17:33,831 --> 01:17:35,031
whatever.

835
01:17:43,741 --> 01:17:46,376
You're sure billy
clanton's in the oriental?

836
01:17:46,844 --> 01:17:47,844
Positive.

837
01:17:50,047 --> 01:17:51,047
All right.

838
01:17:56,437 --> 01:17:57,437
All right.

839
01:17:59,607 --> 01:18:02,109
I'd like you to go down
and talk to billy.

840
01:18:02,643 --> 01:18:05,312
Real calm-like.

841
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:08,148
Tell him that the deal with ike is off.

842
01:18:09,733 --> 01:18:12,586
Tell him I know that ike's
been talking about the deal,

843
01:18:13,621 --> 01:18:16,924
So I'm gonna have
to teach him a lesson.

844
01:18:16,991 --> 01:18:19,893
That I'm gonna bring
charges against ike

845
01:18:19,961 --> 01:18:21,261
And the kid

846
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:24,164
For the stagecoach holdup.

847
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:27,601
And I'm gonna
charge ike

848
01:18:29,837 --> 01:18:32,906
With trying to bribe
a territorial officer.

849
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:35,525
ike'll blow
his stack, brother.

850
01:18:35,593 --> 01:18:36,627
I mean,

851
01:18:36,694 --> 01:18:39,529
When billy tells him,
ike'll be coming after us.

852
01:18:43,451 --> 01:18:44,818
That's right.

853
01:19:06,073 --> 01:19:08,024
Where is doc?

854
01:19:08,092 --> 01:19:09,526
I looked everywhere.

855
01:19:10,895 --> 01:19:12,946
I tried every
saloon in town.

856
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:14,314
I can't find him.

857
01:19:17,718 --> 01:19:18,852
You better
have a drink.

858
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,720
I don't want
a drink!

859
01:19:21,239 --> 01:19:23,005
I want to find doc.

860
01:19:24,275 --> 01:19:26,075
Now, please,
have you seen him?

861
01:19:26,143 --> 01:19:27,810
You must
have seen him

862
01:19:27,878 --> 01:19:29,279
Sometime today.

863
01:19:30,715 --> 01:19:33,250
I haven't seen him
since this morning, katie.

864
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:54,554
Why'd he leave?

865
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:58,091
We had some words.

866
01:19:58,158 --> 01:20:00,143
Well, everybody has words.

867
01:20:02,263 --> 01:20:04,664
This was about
places we've been,

868
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:09,870
And places
we're going.

869
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,574
He never took anybody
anyplace before.

870
01:20:18,179 --> 01:20:19,813
Maybe he never loved

871
01:20:22,617 --> 01:20:23,950
Anyone before.

872
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:28,021
You should try
the chinaman.

873
01:20:32,109 --> 01:20:33,576
The chinaman?

874
01:20:35,596 --> 01:20:38,131
Wong: the palace of mirrors in shanghai.

875
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:41,201
I'd like you
to see that.

876
01:20:42,570 --> 01:20:43,871
Manila.

877
01:20:43,938 --> 01:20:46,539
manila.

878
01:20:46,607 --> 01:20:47,741
Siam.

879
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:50,010
Siam.

880
01:20:50,078 --> 01:20:51,678
Across
the seas,

881
01:20:53,614 --> 01:20:55,349
Where spices grow.

882
01:20:55,416 --> 01:20:56,416
Mmm.

883
01:20:58,485 --> 01:21:01,537
Doc: Across the seas
where spices grow.

884
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:05,308
You son of a bitch.

885
01:21:05,376 --> 01:21:08,595
Jesus christ! Get up, god damn it! Get up!

886
01:21:08,663 --> 01:21:09,996
Wait a minute. Wait a
minute! Look at yourself.

887
01:21:10,064 --> 01:21:11,665
Dirtier than a
quarter horse's butt!

888
01:21:11,732 --> 01:21:13,299
Wait now. Just
wait a minute.

889
01:21:13,367 --> 01:21:15,602
Wong and I are going to the
palace of mirrors. Get up!

890
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:18,906
Oh, well, go on, then,
god damn it, go!

891
01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:21,224
Burn! Burn, you...

892
01:21:23,912 --> 01:21:25,778
Man: Everybody out!

893
01:21:49,737 --> 01:21:51,070
Man: It's too late!

894
01:21:53,874 --> 01:21:55,642
Man: Buckets!
Get the buckets going!

895
01:21:55,709 --> 01:21:58,645
Maybe we can go
away. California.

896
01:22:00,314 --> 01:22:01,414
When?

897
01:22:01,482 --> 01:22:02,482
Soon.

898
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:08,488
"soon"
ain't soon enough.

899
01:22:31,095 --> 01:22:34,531
Kid, go on in there,
see what's going on.

900
01:22:34,599 --> 01:22:36,099
We'll see you
at the corral.

901
01:22:36,166 --> 01:22:37,667
Be careful.

902
01:22:37,735 --> 01:22:39,685
Earp sees you,
he'll kill you.

903
01:22:39,753 --> 01:22:41,888
"I swear
to uphold the law

904
01:22:41,956 --> 01:22:43,924
"of the territory
of arizona

905
01:22:44,758 --> 01:22:46,659
"and of the United States,

906
01:22:47,829 --> 01:22:49,262
"so help me god. "

907
01:22:49,330 --> 01:22:50,697
So help me god.
So help me god.

908
01:22:56,603 --> 01:22:58,004
Mr. Holliday.

909
01:23:00,474 --> 01:23:01,942
Hello, kid.

910
01:23:03,711 --> 01:23:05,111
Sit down.

911
01:23:10,784 --> 01:23:12,285
Mmm!

912
01:23:12,353 --> 01:23:13,486
Would you, uh...

913
01:23:13,554 --> 01:23:14,987
Would you like
a drink?

914
01:23:15,055 --> 01:23:16,623
No, thanks,
mr. Holliday.

915
01:23:21,495 --> 01:23:23,763
They're coming into town, mr. Holliday.

916
01:23:24,998 --> 01:23:26,700
Who's coming
into town?

917
01:23:28,035 --> 01:23:30,403
The clantons
and the mclowerys.

918
01:23:30,471 --> 01:23:31,371
Why?

919
01:23:31,438 --> 01:23:33,472
The marshal made a deal with ike.

920
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:36,158
Ike was supposed to turn
in ringo for the stage job.

921
01:23:36,226 --> 01:23:38,661
Wyatt would give ike
the reward money,

922
01:23:38,729 --> 01:23:40,563
And keep the glory
for himself.

923
01:23:41,966 --> 01:23:43,933
And now the marshal says the deal's off.

924
01:23:44,001 --> 01:23:46,636
He's gonna hold ike and
me for the stage job.

925
01:23:48,405 --> 01:23:49,806
How many are
coming in?

926
01:23:52,944 --> 01:23:53,944
Seven,

927
01:23:55,546 --> 01:23:56,779
Counting me.

928
01:24:06,590 --> 01:24:08,191
Why are you
telling me this?

929
01:24:10,111 --> 01:24:12,312
'cause I don't want you
to die, mr. Holliday.

930
01:24:34,217 --> 01:24:35,568
Into the camera.

931
01:26:29,183 --> 01:26:30,483
They're here.

932
01:26:32,086 --> 01:26:33,419
How many?

933
01:26:33,988 --> 01:26:35,288
Seven.

934
01:28:02,176 --> 01:28:04,494
How many?
Three earps.

935
01:28:04,562 --> 01:28:05,895
And maybe
doc holliday.

936
01:28:05,962 --> 01:28:06,963
Behan: Ike!

937
01:28:07,348 --> 01:28:09,399
Ike!

938
01:28:09,466 --> 01:28:11,551
Now, damn it, ike, I don't want
no shooting in the town limits.

939
01:28:11,618 --> 01:28:12,869
Now, you all
give me your guns!

940
01:28:12,937 --> 01:28:14,470
You're gonna have to take
'em away from us, johnny.

941
01:28:14,538 --> 01:28:15,805
Ike, I don't want
no trouble.

942
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:18,358
You'd better tell that
to the goddamn marshal!

943
01:28:34,908 --> 01:28:36,509
Can't do it,
wyatt.

944
01:28:36,577 --> 01:28:38,210
The town's
my jurisdiction.

945
01:28:39,596 --> 01:28:41,380
We'll settle it
in court, johnny.

946
01:28:45,535 --> 01:28:49,155
You're not going to
solve anything with a gun.

947
01:28:49,222 --> 01:28:52,158
Oh, you'd be surprised the
things you can solve with a gun.

948
01:29:31,732 --> 01:29:33,516
Shotguns.

949
01:29:33,583 --> 01:29:34,600
They got shotguns.

950
01:29:39,857 --> 01:29:41,207
Spread out.

951
01:29:41,275 --> 01:29:42,709
spread out!

952
01:29:46,346 --> 01:29:47,580
Ike: Spread out!

953
01:31:02,172 --> 01:31:05,357
Ike: Holliday, this ain't
none of your affair.

954
01:31:05,425 --> 01:31:06,826
We're here
to talk to earp.

955
01:31:06,894 --> 01:31:07,876
To talk!

956
01:31:13,183 --> 01:31:14,467
God damn you...

957
01:31:51,605 --> 01:31:53,689
Morgan's dead.

958
01:31:53,756 --> 01:31:55,140
They killed
morgan.

959
01:32:43,506 --> 01:32:45,190
Wyatt: They killed
my brother.

960
01:32:46,743 --> 01:32:48,628
They came into this town,

961
01:32:50,898 --> 01:32:53,015
They came in here,
looking for trouble.

962
01:32:53,083 --> 01:32:57,720
They came in here to destroy everything
that we've been trying to build together.

963
01:33:04,410 --> 01:33:05,811
But I'm telling you,

964
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:08,380
I swear to you,

965
01:33:08,448 --> 01:33:12,352
That my brother's death
is not gonna be in vain.

966
01:33:15,822 --> 01:33:17,222
'cause from this,

967
01:33:18,492 --> 01:33:20,793
We're gonna build
a better town.

968
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:25,698
We're gonna build
a better tombstone.

969
01:33:26,967 --> 01:33:28,501
I swear that to you.

970
01:33:49,256 --> 01:33:50,356
That's all.

971
01:33:50,858 --> 01:33:52,174
So long, doc.

972
01:34:09,743 --> 01:34:11,077
Why the kid?

973
01:34:13,814 --> 01:34:16,081
I guess he reminded me
of too many things.
