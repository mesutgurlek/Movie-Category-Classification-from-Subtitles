Gold on Indian land! The Sioux tribes
were given other reservation,

6
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,684
and President Grant set a day

7
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:05,492
when settlers might race for
possession of the rich lands.

In the middle of the seventies,

14
00:01:24,415 --> 00:01:29,078
ship of hope bore thousands of emigrants

15
00:01:29,152 --> 00:01:34,488
to seek the reality of their dreams in America.

16
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:47,467
Some sought happiness ...
some only the horn of plently ...

17
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,306
the chalice of ... the Unholy Grail ...

18
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,743
And from crowded eastern cities,

19
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,809
civilization began pouring the overflow into

20
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:03,856
the trackless immensity of the West.

21
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,085
Spring, 1876 ...

22
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:14,259
Old World blood began to fuse with Colonial strains ...

23
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:18,100
and "westward the course
of empire takes its way".

24
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,631
In the Black Hills of Dakota,

25
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:52,569
the outriders of progress had
set up a trading post at Custer.

26
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:05,307
" Gold! Gold ... I'm tellin' ye ...
the mountains is just abustin' with it! "

27
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,525
" Sorry, Lucas, but we can't touch that land ...

28
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,995
it's on the Sioux Reservation. "

29
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,656
" Where'd you strike it, Lucas? "

30
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:06,004
And then came the eager thud of hoofs
and the creak of wagon wheels.

31
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,589
The start of an empire
that was to be compounded

32
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,456
from the peoples of the face of the earth!

" But 'bull' ... I don't think
we need any more help."

151
00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:02,543
" Not so bad ..."

152
00:42:11,626 --> 00:42:12,820
" Not so good ..."

153
00:42:16,797 --> 00:42:19,391
" All right ... he'll do."

154
00:42:50,097 --> 00:42:53,328
" Now let nature take its course."

155
00:43:18,225 --> 00:43:20,557
" I hope he don't drink ..."

156
00:43:23,898 --> 00:43:26,958
"... we don't want no soaks around here."

157
00:43:45,486 --> 00:43:50,014
" I haven't seen your dad around
... Where is he? "

158
00:45:12,973 --> 00:45:15,942
" Sheriff some of the better element ...

159
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:19,639
are complaining about the way
you run this town. "

160
00:45:35,529 --> 00:45:38,327
" Listen, Rabbi ... Business is terrible! ...

161
00:45:38,399 --> 00:45:41,994
Nobody buys a new suit even to be buried in. "

162

Cleanliness is next to Goldliness ...

163
00:45:50,477 --> 00:45:54,811
That's why Saturday night
comes before Sunday.

164
00:46:42,629 --> 00:46:48,363
" You don't reckon she'll be wantin'
us to take a bath, do you? "

165
00:46:52,806 --> 00:46:56,037
" I'm a little nervous about it."

166
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:04,281
" Guard the tent."

167
00:47:45,192 --> 00:47:49,754
" How about three fingers of bug juice?"

168
00:48:38,345 --> 00:48:41,678
♫ " I'm here in Dakota I want the world to know ...♫

169
00:48:41,748 --> 00:48:45,616
♫ Goin' to get a homstead.
Cause I found my calico! " ♫

170
00:49:27,594 --> 00:49:30,825
" Do you like that tune, Miss Lee? "

171
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:57,389
" Having a nice time ? "

172
00:51:21,942 --> 00:51:26,470
" You're goin' to tell me
how to get that gold ! "

173
00:51:58,311 --> 00:52:04,045
" Hunter, you've been takin' in too much
territory... Now you're all through! "

174
00:52:35,248 --> 00:52:36,272
" You bungling fool !"

175
00:52:51,598 --> 00:52:58,436
" Hunter sent him to be make me
tell the way to the gold land ..."

but it'll take you to where there's gold ! "

177
00:53:23,797 --> 00:53:27,164
The night before the rush ....
Custer, an armed camp ...

178
00:53:27,234 --> 00:53:30,965
with "Bull" Stanley leading
the revolt against Hunter.

179
00:53:41,047 --> 00:53:43,811
... while in the little church the women pray ...

180
00:53:43,884 --> 00:53:46,648
for safety, today ...
Divine guidance tomorrow...

181
00:53:48,088 --> 00:53:54,618
"... and as He led the children of Israel into
the promised land, so He will lead us ..."

182
00:54:08,108 --> 00:54:13,808
Knowing his danger, Hunter fans the flames
of lawless abandon among his followers.

183
00:54:38,305 --> 00:54:41,706
" Burn that psalm-singing preacher's shack! "

184
00:58:18,591 --> 00:58:19,853
" Brother! Brother! "

185

00:59:25,325 --> 00:59:29,091
" We'll sneak across the line tonight and wait. "

189
01:00:26,452 --> 01:00:27,817
" Millie! Little Sister! "

190
01:00:39,632 --> 01:00:42,863
" Millie, who is ... the man? "

191
01:04:06,439 --> 01:04:08,430
The Grand Land Rush!

192
01:04:08,508 --> 01:04:11,807
Morning broke with the clatter of wagons ...

193
01:04:11,878 --> 01:04:15,575
the roaring, sweating, cursing,
fighting mob scrambling ...

194
01:04:15,648 --> 01:04:18,583
for position in the line.

195
01:04:36,236 --> 01:04:41,572
" It's time for you to start, Missy ...
you've got a long, hard ride ahead ..."

01:04:44,143 --> 01:04:47,442
" I'm ready when you are, 'Bull'! "

197
01:04:51,251 --> 01:04:58,123
" Mike and 'Spade' will take care of you ...
I've got to look for someone else."

198
01:05:03,863 --> 01:05:05,831
" Please, 'Bull'... I need you. "

199
01:05:34,661 --> 01:05:44,036
On the line! Ready for the dot of twelve ...
And the race for land and gold.

Carleton's thoroughbreds ... sensing
the drama of the historic trial of speed.

211

" Keep your plow! You'll find the real

we'll stay right here.
This soil is as rich as gold."
