1
00:02:03,765 --> 00:02:06,002
Give him a rubdown and
plenty of feed. Yes, sir.

2
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:08,655
Logan Stuart's the name.
Thanks, Mr. Stuart.

3
00:02:30,138 --> 00:02:31,415
Damp day.

4
00:02:32,123 --> 00:02:34,065
How's Jacksonville?
Lively.

5
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,108
Credit to account?
I'll take that specie.

6
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:43,123
We're short of cash
at the diggings.

7
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:44,724
What time do you open
in the morning?

8
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:45,877
Tomorrow's Sunday.

9
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:47,291
Then put the specie
in the saddle bags

10
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:49,660
and I'll come by for it
before you close tonight.

11
00:02:49,727 --> 00:02:51,767
You must have
around 7,000 here.

12
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,109
That's no trinket to be left
lying loose around a hotel room.

13
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,663
Gold is only yellow gravel,
Cornelius.

14
00:02:56,736 --> 00:02:58,908
Yes, but the yellow color
makes all the difference.

15
00:02:58,976 --> 00:03:01,530
Butter's yellow, too, and
you can spread it on bread.

16
00:03:01,602 --> 00:03:03,293
Ever try that with gold?

17
00:03:03,362 --> 00:03:05,599
For a business man,
you've got odd ideas.

18
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,968
If I were a banker,
as I shall be some day,

19
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:10,621
I'd set you down as unsound
and lend you nothing.

20
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:14,434
A man can choose his own gods,
Cornelius. What are your gods?

21
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:16,222
What?

22
00:03:36,392 --> 00:03:37,767
Damp day.

23
00:03:40,073 --> 00:03:41,983
Let me see that.
Yes, sir.

24
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:46,596
It's a beautiful little
locket. It came from England.

25
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:47,845
I'll take it.

26
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:51,047
A fortunate young lady, whoever
she is. Anything else, sir?

27
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:55,371
Yes, I need some dry clothes, shirt,
socks, everything from the skin out.

28
00:04:17,616 --> 00:04:19,853
Hey, Logan! Come here.

29
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,107
How are you, McLane?

30
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:30,383
Fine. Just the man I want to see.

31
00:04:30,451 --> 00:04:32,524
What are the Indians doing
down your way this year?

32
00:04:32,596 --> 00:04:34,090
So far, quiet and uncertain.

33
00:04:34,164 --> 00:04:35,474
Whiskey?
Whiskey.

34
00:04:35,925 --> 00:04:37,102
Whiskey.

35
00:04:37,717 --> 00:04:41,133
<i>Logan, I've got a consignment of
general hardware from the brig Alice</i>

36
00:04:41,206 --> 00:04:44,054
to be delivered to Clay
& King at Jacksonville.

37
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:47,250
It's cloth, rope,
tin dishes, buckets.

38
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:49,424
I'm shipping by boat
to Salem.

39
00:04:49,495 --> 00:04:50,673
Do you want to
pack it from there?

40
00:04:50,743 --> 00:04:51,921
How many mules will it make?

41
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,163
Oh, 20, I suppose.
What's your freight?

42
00:04:54,232 --> 00:04:55,694
Three dollars a mule
per day.

43
00:04:55,768 --> 00:04:56,880
Agreeable.

44
00:04:58,745 --> 00:05:00,688
It'll be in Salem on the
20th. Two more of the same.

45
00:05:00,762 --> 00:05:02,071
Not for me.
I've got to see

46
00:05:02,137 --> 00:05:04,309
if I can get a load of windows
hauled out to Gales Creek.

47
00:05:04,378 --> 00:05:05,720
Windows?
Windows with glass?

48
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:07,063
We're becoming civilized.

49
00:05:07,131 --> 00:05:08,855
Oh, Bob. Bob Miller.

50
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,949
Lumber's selling sky-high
in San Francisco.

51
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,185
You sure enough will make
a handsome profit, Captain.

52
00:05:17,853 --> 00:05:19,893
Miss Lucy Overmire arrived?

53
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:22,520
<i>In Room 10. Just off the
Cascades boat. Thanks.</i>

54
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:24,249
She's been asking
for George Camrose.

55
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,912
We got through all right.

56
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:30,550
But the train back of us, 50
wagons, not a one of them left.

57
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,326
Come in, George.

58
00:05:42,882 --> 00:05:44,704
Why, Logan!
Hello, Lucy.

59
00:05:45,218 --> 00:05:47,455
Oh, George had to make a
sudden trip to Crescent City.

60
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:49,857
He knew I was coming up, so he
asked me if I'd bring you home.

61
00:05:49,924 --> 00:05:52,739
Will you mind having me
on your hands, Logan?

62
00:05:53,765 --> 00:05:55,172
That was a foolish question.

63
00:05:55,237 --> 00:05:56,798
You don't mind
having women on your hands.

64
00:05:56,869 --> 00:05:58,113
Where did you get that?

65
00:05:58,181 --> 00:05:59,294
Rumor.

66
00:06:00,134 --> 00:06:01,923
George Camrose, I bet.

67
00:06:02,598 --> 00:06:04,093
Oh, have you got
stout clothes?

68
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:07,167
I want to get started before
daylight and the weather's foul.

69
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,646
I don't mind.

70
00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:11,266
How was your visit
up at The Dalles?

71
00:06:11,336 --> 00:06:12,449
Quiet.

72
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,808
Oh, Logan, there were a lot of
cattle abandoned by the emigrants.

73
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:17,703
You could probably get them
for very little.

74
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:19,679
Did you see any mules?
No.

75
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,873
Well, five o'clock then,
and dress warm.

76
00:06:23,947 --> 00:06:26,249
We'll make Salem the first day
and Toms River the second.

77
00:06:26,315 --> 00:06:28,258
We should be in Jacksonville
Friday afternoon,

78
00:06:28,331 --> 00:06:30,699
unless that's traveling
too fast for you.

79
00:06:30,764 --> 00:06:31,746
No.

80
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:35,461
I suppose you're going down
to play a little poker now.

81
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:37,420
I guess not. Good night.

82
00:06:39,886 --> 00:06:41,348
A woman, Logan?

83
00:06:53,905 --> 00:06:55,913
I kept open for you.
Thanks.

84
00:07:00,883 --> 00:07:02,344
<i>I was just reading
in the Advertiser</i>

85
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:03,628
they've completed
a suspension bridge

86
00:07:03,698 --> 00:07:06,033
across Niagara Falls for the
railroad. Well, that's progress.

87
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:08,140
Out our way, we haven't
even got a stagecoach yet.

88
00:07:08,212 --> 00:07:10,830
Well, you've got
to have the roads first.

89
00:07:12,661 --> 00:07:13,937
Maybe it's
the other way around.

90
00:07:14,005 --> 00:07:17,169
Get the stagecoaches and
there'll be plenty of roads.

91
00:07:17,462 --> 00:07:20,277
Well, from
a banking viewpoint,

92
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:23,057
I'd want to be sure
there were roads there first!

93
00:07:23,127 --> 00:07:24,109
What's that?

94
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:26,485
I said, from
a banking viewpoint, I'd...

95
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,644
Oh, poohdaddle!

96
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:43,057
Come in, Logan.

97
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,790
You see,
it wasn't a woman.

98
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:50,005
Why didn't you say so then?

99
00:07:50,076 --> 00:07:51,799
You're marrying George,
not me.

100
00:07:51,868 --> 00:07:54,739
What have you got in the
saddle bags? Gold coin.

101
00:07:54,813 --> 00:07:56,756
You know, I was watching you
from the window.

102
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,390
There was a man standing
at the corner of Alder

103
00:07:58,461 --> 00:07:59,803
as you passed
and he followed you.

104
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:01,332
Don't worry about it.

105
00:08:01,406 --> 00:08:03,447
Good night, Lucy.
Good night.

106
00:09:04,492 --> 00:09:07,078
Logan! What happened?

107
00:09:07,148 --> 00:09:08,709
A bad try. He got away.
Who was it?

108
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,570
I have an idea it was Bragg.

109
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:12,230
He had an arm
like a chunk of oak.

110
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,440
You're hurt!
I'm all right.

111
00:09:16,783 --> 00:09:18,758
Lucy, you better get
out of here.

112
00:09:18,831 --> 00:09:20,423
Go on to bed
and get some sleep.

113
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:22,535
We're leaving at five sharp.

114
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:41,581
What makes you so sure
it was Bragg up in Portland?

115
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:42,994
He might have trailed me.

116
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,653
He's had me on his mind
for quite awhile,

117
00:09:44,724 --> 00:09:46,929
ever since those two miners
were killed over at Evans' Ferry.

118
00:09:46,997 --> 00:09:48,491
The ones
the Indians murdered?

119
00:09:48,565 --> 00:09:49,743
Indians?

120
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:51,313
I was out on the road
that morning

121
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:54,284
and I saw Bragg come out of
the willows running his horse.

122
00:09:54,358 --> 00:09:57,490
A few minutes later, I
stumbled onto the two bodies.

123
00:09:57,687 --> 00:09:59,378
I could've had him hanged
for it and he knows it.

124
00:09:59,447 --> 00:10:02,066
Why didn't you?
That was rather careless.

125
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:03,794
I didn't see him do it.

126
00:10:03,864 --> 00:10:06,384
You wouldn't want to hang a man
if there was the slightest doubt.

127
00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:08,017
No, you wouldn't.

128
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,147
Things have got to be dead even
with you, is that it, Logan?

129
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:25,080
Ease up there!

130
00:10:29,597 --> 00:10:32,413
Easy, easy.

131
00:10:33,662 --> 00:10:35,517
Where're you from?
Salt Lake.

132
00:10:35,582 --> 00:10:38,300
No good back there anymore.
Too populated.

133
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:40,702
Get over here!
Get over here!

134
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,094
Come on!

135
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,717
How are things along the way?

136
00:11:23,785 --> 00:11:26,720
One miner was killed last
night over at Graves Creek.

137
00:11:26,793 --> 00:11:27,971
Indians?

138
00:11:29,674 --> 00:11:31,103
Are you game
to make a night ride of it?

139
00:11:31,178 --> 00:11:32,739
We'll reach Ben Dance's
by daylight.

140
00:11:32,811 --> 00:11:33,891
Fine.

141
00:12:45,113 --> 00:12:47,186
Howdy, Logan! Come on in.

142
00:12:48,762 --> 00:12:50,518
Tired?
Dead.

143
00:12:50,586 --> 00:12:51,928
Go along in.

144
00:12:52,251 --> 00:12:53,233
Hello, Mr. Dance.

145
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:55,195
Morning, Miss Lucy.
Breakfast is awaiting.

146
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:57,812
Asa, come out here
and get these horses!

147
00:12:57,884 --> 00:13:00,024
Hi, Logan!
Hi, Logan!

148
00:13:00,637 --> 00:13:02,971
<i>"Hi, Logan"? "Mr. Stuart,"
you young varmints.</i>

149
00:13:03,038 --> 00:13:05,886
Now rustle off them horses
and give them a good feed.

150
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,154
Well, how'd you find things
on the way down?

151
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:09,399
Not too bad.

152
00:13:09,469 --> 00:13:11,095
Had a little trouble
over at Graves Creek.

153
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,054
One miner was killed.
Yeah, Indians.

154
00:13:13,118 --> 00:13:16,894
They got a Cavalry outfit under some young
lieutenant combing the canyon for them.

155
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,421
But I got a little bet
with myself

156
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:21,082
he'll get bushwhacked first
off. He don't know Indian style.

157
00:13:21,152 --> 00:13:22,232
Why didn't you
tell him, Ben?

158
00:13:22,304 --> 00:13:24,028
You can't tell them
army fellows nothing.

159
00:13:24,097 --> 00:13:25,242
They got a little brown book.

160
00:13:25,313 --> 00:13:28,762
If it ain't in that little
brown book, it just ain't true.

161
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,319
How was Portland, Logan?

162
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,020
A thousand people
and raining.

163
00:13:33,091 --> 00:13:36,125
How can anyone live in such
a crowd? Come and eat, Lucy.

164
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:38,170
I couldn't eat a thing,
Mrs. Dance.

165
00:13:38,244 --> 00:13:40,285
What she needs
is some sleep.

166
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:43,551
Well, hello, Caroline.
How are you, Logan?

167
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:45,211
Oh, I don't think
you two are acquainted.

168
00:13:45,286 --> 00:13:48,004
Lucy, this is Caroline Marsh.
Lucy Overmire.

169
00:13:49,383 --> 00:13:51,107
I've heard about you.

170
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:52,516
I'm so sorry
about your father.

171
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,274
I brought you something
from Portland.

172
00:13:54,343 --> 00:13:55,903
Did you? What?

173
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,895
If you have on your best
Sunday dress around noon time,

174
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,651
I'll give it to you.

175
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:03,202
Will you fix a bed
for Lucy, dear?

176
00:14:03,273 --> 00:14:04,222
We traveled all night.

177
00:14:04,297 --> 00:14:06,981
And when you travel
with Logan, you travel.

178
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:08,391
Come along.

179
00:14:14,284 --> 00:14:17,034
I thought maybe she'd be
on her way back to England.

180
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,147
What for?

181
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,702
Her folks come out here to
start a new life for themselves.

182
00:14:21,805 --> 00:14:25,767
She's not the sort to give up just
'cause the Indians killed her pa.

183
00:14:25,838 --> 00:14:27,594
It's a joy
having her around, Logan.

184
00:14:27,662 --> 00:14:29,092
We always
wanted a daughter.

185
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,181
Sure.

186
00:14:30,255 --> 00:14:31,565
But like
all good-looking daughters,

187
00:14:31,632 --> 00:14:34,502
it don't look like we're
going to keep her long, Ma.

188
00:14:35,536 --> 00:14:39,050
Logan... I mean, Mr. Stuart, do you
think the Indians will break out?

189
00:14:39,121 --> 00:14:40,331
It's always possible, Asa.

190
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:43,303
A peace treaty don't seem to mean
nothing to them Rogue beasters.

191
00:14:43,377 --> 00:14:46,574
Well, it's their land and we're
on it and they don't forget it.

192
00:14:46,641 --> 00:14:48,136
Things'll be all right,
I reckon,

193
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,120
unless some medicine man
stirs them up

194
00:14:50,194 --> 00:14:52,464
or some white cuss
starts something.

195
00:14:52,531 --> 00:14:54,571
You'll know it beforehand,
they'll get insolent.

196
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,684
That's the time to fort up.

197
00:14:57,076 --> 00:14:59,859
Well, this is my fort
and darned if I budge.

198
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:01,843
That's right, Ben.

199
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:34,066
Ma is sending Caroline
over to McGarry's place.

200
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,344
Mrs. McGarry's
come to her time.

201
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,050
Now, there's everything
you'll need, dear.

202
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,198
You want me to send Dr.
Balance back from Jacksonville?

203
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,546
I can do
whatever's necessary.

204
00:15:43,614 --> 00:15:45,108
Oh, for sure,
it's only a baby.

205
00:15:45,182 --> 00:15:47,070
You stay at
McGarry's tonight, Caroline.

206
00:15:47,134 --> 00:15:49,436
I'll be over tomorrow
and ride back with you!

207
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,675
Give my hellos
to your ma, Lucy.

208
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,686
Say I'm lonesome for talk.

209
00:15:57,344 --> 00:15:58,654
Bye, Logan!

210
00:16:14,596 --> 00:16:16,898
Hey!
You ain't got much time!

211
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,680
Well, here's where
I leave you.

212
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:30,881
It takes me
back to England.

213
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:32,512
It's just like
my grandmother's.

214
00:16:32,584 --> 00:16:34,177
Hey! Come on!

215
00:16:35,112 --> 00:16:36,389
Thank you.

216
00:16:41,002 --> 00:16:43,523
Oh, Logan, there's a
cabin-raising Saturday week.

217
00:16:43,594 --> 00:16:45,285
Liza Stone and
Gray Bartlett are marrying.

218
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:46,784
I'll be there.

219
00:16:50,988 --> 00:16:53,094
You'd have had your kiss
if I hadn't been here.

220
00:16:53,165 --> 00:16:55,653
Yes. I'm sorry I caused you to miss it.

221
00:16:59,181 --> 00:17:00,905
But what's any woman
to you?

222
00:17:00,973 --> 00:17:03,941
You're never happy
except when you're on the go.

223
00:17:04,462 --> 00:17:08,619
I guess I'm just stuck on this
Oregon or maybe I'm just ambitious.

224
00:17:09,391 --> 00:17:11,334
I want to see a Stuart
& Company pack outfit

225
00:17:11,408 --> 00:17:13,350
stringing along
every road.

226
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,714
And when stages come,
I want them to be my stages.

227
00:17:17,457 --> 00:17:20,589
Is that what makes you so
restless and discontented?

228
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,538
Or is it a woman, Logan?

229
00:17:23,922 --> 00:17:25,865
Must it always be a woman?

230
00:17:32,756 --> 00:17:36,554
<i>Take me to
the Rogue River Valley</i>

231
00:17:36,661 --> 00:17:37,839
<i>Valley</i>

232
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:42,733
<i>Where the silvery
moonlight shines</i>

233
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:46,898
<i>Some one waits for me
in the valley</i>

234
00:17:47,703 --> 00:17:51,795
<i>There among
the blue-tipped pines</i>

235
00:17:52,536 --> 00:17:54,925
<i>She'll be by the river</i>

236
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:57,204
<i>Where all heaven beams</i>

237
00:17:57,273 --> 00:17:59,794
<i>And there by the river</i>

238
00:17:59,866 --> 00:18:02,517
<i>We'll find
the trail of dreams</i>

239
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:06,711
<i>Donkey,
don't you dare to dally</i>

240
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:12,217
<i>Can't you hear
the kill deer song?</i>

241
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:15,030
Say, Hi. When did Honey
Bragg get into town?

242
00:18:15,102 --> 00:18:16,444
Well, it looks like
he just rode in

243
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,615
the way
his horse is lathered.

244
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,759
Must've done
a little riding yourself.

245
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,172
All the way from Portland.

246
00:18:22,238 --> 00:18:24,028
Don't tell anyone.
Huh?

247
00:18:24,415 --> 00:18:25,942
What was that song
you were singing, Hi?

248
00:18:26,016 --> 00:18:27,904
Oh, I don't know.
Just a little song.

249
00:18:27,968 --> 00:18:29,878
It sounded very romantic.

250
00:18:29,953 --> 00:18:31,927
Well, Mandy
gets that way sometimes.

251
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,561
Silly, isn't she?

252
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:36,503
<i>She'll be by the river</i>

253
00:18:36,577 --> 00:18:38,814
<i>Where all heaven beams</i>

254
00:18:38,882 --> 00:18:41,337
<i>And there by the river</i>

255
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,280
<i>We'll find
the trail of dreams</i>

256
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:46,178
<i>Donkey, don't you dare...</i>

257
00:18:46,243 --> 00:18:47,902
Steady! Whoa! Whoa!

258
00:18:52,901 --> 00:18:54,495
Dad!
Lucy!

259
00:18:55,878 --> 00:18:57,951
Lucy! Hello, Logan.

260
00:18:58,022 --> 00:18:59,429
Mommy.
Nice trip, Logan?

261
00:18:59,494 --> 00:19:01,502
Did you enjoy yourself? Did
you have a nice time, dear?

262
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:02,949
Yes, it was fun.

263
00:19:03,015 --> 00:19:06,660
Oh, we stopped by the Dances
and Mrs. Dance sends her hellos.

264
00:19:06,888 --> 00:19:08,415
There she is, George,
there's your girl.

265
00:19:08,488 --> 00:19:09,830
Thank you, Logan.

266
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:11,937
Did he behave himself, Lucy?

267
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,701
Oh, you're lovely.
I'd almost forgotten.

268
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,778
Not entirely
I hope, George.

269
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,373
Is that the best
you can do, George?

270
00:19:18,441 --> 00:19:19,554
Could you do any better?

271
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:23,271
If I hadn't seen my girl for a
whole month, a whole lot better.

272
00:19:25,675 --> 00:19:28,097
Same old roughneck.
No polish at all.

273
00:19:31,949 --> 00:19:33,640
Did you mind my asking Logan
to bring you home?

274
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:35,302
What took you over
to Crescent City, George?

275
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:38,757
A mining claim. Looked like
a real strike, but it wasn't.

276
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,806
Another rainbow?

277
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,445
One day, I'll bring you
the pot of gold

278
00:19:42,511 --> 00:19:45,130
from the end of that rainbow,
you'll see.

279
00:19:45,263 --> 00:19:46,693
Are you glad
to be back, Lucy?

280
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,940
How was the trip?
Wonderful.

281
00:20:06,132 --> 00:20:08,521
Good night.
Good night.

282
00:20:09,652 --> 00:20:12,141
Where's Morrow?
He'll be back Tuesday.

283
00:20:12,405 --> 00:20:14,412
I sent 40 mules
on the trip.

284
00:20:14,741 --> 00:20:17,524
Vane Blazier will take the
Scottsburg string in the morning,

285
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,801
20 mules.

286
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,773
Put this on the books, Clench.

287
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:24,434
Thirty mules to be at Salem
on the 20th.

288
00:20:24,568 --> 00:20:26,391
Henry McLane's freight.

289
00:20:26,968 --> 00:20:28,561
Where will you get the mules?

290
00:20:28,632 --> 00:20:30,673
You're spread
pretty thin already.

291
00:20:30,746 --> 00:20:33,364
Maybe it's time for us
to buy a few more.

292
00:20:33,818 --> 00:20:37,397
Buy, buy.
Always buy, buy.

293
00:20:44,189 --> 00:20:45,531
Hello, Vane.

294
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:48,792
Did you stop by at Dances?
Yes.

295
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:52,502
How is everybody?
Caroline, you mean?

296
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:54,298
She's fine.

297
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:00,148
Do you realize you've got close
on $50,000 sunk in this place?

298
00:21:00,223 --> 00:21:01,237
We must be rich.

299
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,127
You ought to have $10,000
laid by for trouble.

300
00:21:04,448 --> 00:21:07,383
What trouble? The
trouble that always comes.

301
00:21:07,456 --> 00:21:10,654
Why do you suppose I came here,
6,000 miles from Liverpool?

302
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:13,536
This is Jacksonville, Clench,
U.S.A. We sail with the tide.

303
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:15,293
All Americans think that.

304
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:17,502
They think the tide
flows forever for them.

305
00:21:17,571 --> 00:21:18,880
But mark me, Logan.

306
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:23,204
Gold veins run out, crops
fail, men starve, wars come.

307
00:21:23,268 --> 00:21:26,268
And businesses fail. Then we
get a new deck and deal again.

308
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,348
So you'll buy the mules?

309
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:35,046
What happened to you, Logan?
We waited supper for you.

310
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,215
I thought you and George
would want to be together.

311
00:21:37,286 --> 00:21:39,970
Why, Logan, that's
a very tender sentiment.

312
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:42,854
George, when is this girl
going to marry you?

313
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:45,375
I doubt
if she knows herself, Logan.

314
00:21:45,448 --> 00:21:47,488
When are you taking me,
Lucy?

315
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,062
George, do you like poetry?

316
00:21:49,128 --> 00:21:51,038
Must I like poetry
to be your husband?

317
00:21:51,113 --> 00:21:53,699
We will be married
when the leaves fall.

318
00:21:53,898 --> 00:21:57,030
You see, Logan. She strings
me up and lets me swing.

319
00:21:57,163 --> 00:21:58,757
You mean the maple leaves
that fall early,

320
00:21:58,828 --> 00:22:00,901
or the pine needles
that never fall at all?

321
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:02,794
Come on, there's a fight. Fight? Who is it?

322
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,006
I don't know.
What's going on?

323
00:22:04,077 --> 00:22:05,189
There's a fight at the back
of the settlement.

324
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,406
Come on!

325
00:22:07,373 --> 00:22:08,802
You better
get up there, Logan.

326
00:22:08,878 --> 00:22:11,464
It's your friend
Vane Blazer and Bragg.

327
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:15,494
Come on, George.

328
00:22:20,335 --> 00:22:22,158
Don't never crowd me, boy.

329
00:22:22,224 --> 00:22:23,751
Nobody crowded you.

330
00:22:23,856 --> 00:22:25,678
Oh, you're calling me
a liar.

331
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:28,844
Stand up to him, Blazier.
Yeah. Let him have it.

332
00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:30,058
I didn't call you a liar.

333
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:32,017
I'll bust you up
proper, boy.

334
00:22:35,986 --> 00:22:37,842
Having a little trouble, Vane?

335
00:22:39,156 --> 00:22:40,400
Hello, Bragg.

336
00:22:41,012 --> 00:22:42,987
Logan, my friend,
how are you?

337
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,948
I hear you've been away.

338
00:22:45,076 --> 00:22:48,590
I'm here and there,
I'm a restless man.

339
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:51,056
I've been away, too.
You have?

340
00:22:51,991 --> 00:22:54,773
Well, you're a restless man
like me.

341
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,313
I notice
you're favoring your left leg.

342
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:02,193
A horse threw me.

343
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:05,613
It couldn't be you fell
through a window by any chance?

344
00:23:05,912 --> 00:23:08,018
Oh, let's get on
with the fight.

345
00:23:12,986 --> 00:23:15,321
See you sometime, Logan.

346
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,298
Well, by gum,
it was a freeze out.

347
00:23:33,407 --> 00:23:35,546
Come on, Vane,
buy you a drink.

348
00:23:35,711 --> 00:23:38,232
Never mind.
I can fight my own battles.

349
00:23:43,265 --> 00:23:44,989
That was quite a surprise.

350
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:47,098
More of a disappointment
to the boys, I'd say.

351
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,560
What can you expect from
people living in the wilderness?

352
00:23:49,634 --> 00:23:51,064
What's wilderness
got to do with it?

353
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:53,626
Everything, I think.
What do you say, Lucy?

354
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:56,733
Some men are more primitive
than others, I guess.

355
00:23:56,899 --> 00:23:59,004
Some men
just fight it harder.

356
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,689
Put his weight on Honey Bragg
and he broke.

357
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:06,850
I'd say bent.

358
00:24:06,982 --> 00:24:09,316
Well, broke or bent,
what do you make of it, Hi?

359
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:12,164
You're a lawyer, Jonas,
you figure it out.

360
00:24:15,143 --> 00:24:16,899
I'm glad
you enjoyed the trip, Lucy,

361
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:19,172
but it's great
to have you back.

362
00:24:19,336 --> 00:24:21,540
I missed you.
Thank you, George.

363
00:24:22,312 --> 00:24:23,873
Well, see you tomorrow.

364
00:24:26,826 --> 00:24:30,656
You ought to do your kissing in
private, George, and do it better.

365
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,563
I'll ask you again, Logan.
Could you do better?

366
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,205
You brought it
on yourself, George.

367
00:24:53,711 --> 00:24:55,751
Good night.
Good night, Lucy.

368
00:25:00,785 --> 00:25:02,159
Going to play a little poker?

369
00:25:02,225 --> 00:25:03,655
I got to get some sleep,

370
00:25:03,729 --> 00:25:04,712
Oh, it's still early.

371
00:25:04,786 --> 00:25:07,688
I'm off on a trip tomorrow. I'm
going to look for some mules.

372
00:25:07,762 --> 00:25:09,323
Another trip so soon?

373
00:25:09,395 --> 00:25:10,802
If you're not careful,
one of these days

374
00:25:10,867 --> 00:25:13,170
you're going to end up
being a tired millionaire.

375
00:25:13,236 --> 00:25:14,992
Then I'll take it easy.

376
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,482
See you when you get back.
Good luck.

377
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:23,818
<i>I'm riding on a silver saddle</i>

378
00:25:25,365 --> 00:25:29,556
<i>The moon is my silver saddle</i>

379
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:33,103
<i>And long before
the stars skedaddle</i>

380
00:25:36,728 --> 00:25:40,209
<i>I'll be with my love tonight</i>

381
00:25:42,265 --> 00:25:44,982
<i>She'll be in the gloaming</i>

382
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:46,736
<i>Where all heaven beams</i>

383
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,087
Oh, hello, Johnny.
Hi, Camrose.

384
00:25:48,155 --> 00:25:50,905
Ah, say, I know it's after hours,
but I saw a light in your office.

385
00:25:50,971 --> 00:25:52,826
Mind letting me have my dust?
Got some poker to play.

386
00:25:52,891 --> 00:25:54,747
Sure, Johnny, but I'll have
to ask you to wait outside

387
00:25:54,812 --> 00:25:56,274
while I open the safe.
Company rules.

388
00:25:56,349 --> 00:25:57,756
Sure, I know.

389
00:25:59,613 --> 00:26:03,389
<i>The moon is my silver saddle</i>

390
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:09,178
<i>And long before

391
00:26:10,878 --> 00:26:14,676
<i>I'll be with my love tonight</i>

392
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:21,279
<i>Me and my old Daisy,
up there in the sky</i>

393
00:26:21,953 --> 00:26:26,776
<i>And my heart beating crazy,
but it's no wonder why</i>

394
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:31,231
<i>I'm riding on a silver saddle</i>

395
00:26:33,155 --> 00:26:37,182
<i>To someone
who loves me right</i>

396
00:26:38,756 --> 00:26:43,230
<i>The moon is my silver saddle</i>

397
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:49,181
<i>I'm riding the moon tonight</i>

398
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:51,902
Hello, Johnny.

399
00:26:52,104 --> 00:26:53,249
How were things
up the Applegate?

400
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,597
Oh, terrible.

401
00:26:54,664 --> 00:26:56,453
All I got for my trouble
was this watch.

402
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,600
Oh, I see.

403
00:26:57,672 --> 00:27:00,771
Yeah, the dandiest thing. I found
it hidden in an old Indian skull.

404
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,230
I'll trade you
a good fiddle for it.

405
00:27:03,658 --> 00:27:04,868
What would I want
with a fiddle?

406
00:27:04,937 --> 00:27:07,426
Well, all you can do with that
is clock the time.

407
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:09,888
With a fiddle
you can pass the time.

408
00:27:10,571 --> 00:27:11,881
All right,
I'll trade you for that.

409
00:27:11,948 --> 00:27:15,080
Oh no, not my Mandy.
Mmm-mmm, no.

410
00:27:17,228 --> 00:27:19,880
Say, how long does it take
to open a safe?

411
00:27:28,303 --> 00:27:29,830
Come in, Johnny.

412
00:27:38,801 --> 00:27:40,589
There you are, Johnny.

413
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:45,518
Much obliged, Camrose.
Glad to do it.

414
00:27:45,586 --> 00:27:47,529
Good luck with your poker.

415
00:28:02,742 --> 00:28:03,855
Heads.

416
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,000
Hello, Linnet.

417
00:28:30,747 --> 00:28:31,729
Hello.

418
00:28:31,804 --> 00:28:34,390
Coming up to Lestrade's?
Oh, maybe later.

419
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:37,621
Uh, you feeling
lucky tonight?

420
00:28:37,693 --> 00:28:40,214
I always feel lucky.
That's my trouble.

421
00:28:40,734 --> 00:28:42,141
I'll see you.

422
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,640
King high straight.

423
00:28:47,775 --> 00:28:48,953
Ace high.

424
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,479
It's too good for me.
And me.

425
00:28:51,552 --> 00:28:54,488
That cleans me.
Of all the rotten luck.

426
00:28:54,593 --> 00:28:56,699
You're a
cleaned chicken, huh?

427
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:00,345
I'll have to give you
my IOU, Jack.

428
00:29:00,418 --> 00:29:01,498
With pleasure.

429
00:29:01,571 --> 00:29:03,906
Marta, pen and ink
for Mr. Camrose.

430
00:29:05,508 --> 00:29:08,443
Too bad your friend Logan
couldn't be with us tonight.

431
00:29:08,516 --> 00:29:10,938
Oh, he's off
on another trip tomorrow.

432
00:29:11,013 --> 00:29:12,605
Always on the move.

433
00:29:12,676 --> 00:29:14,564
I wish I had his energy.

434
00:29:15,076 --> 00:29:17,466
He came near using some
of it tonight on Bragg.

435
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:18,621
And Bragg backed down.

436
00:29:18,694 --> 00:29:20,320
What did Logan
want to butt in for?

437
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,587
Well, maybe he didn't want to
see that young fellow butchered.

438
00:29:23,655 --> 00:29:27,169
All you boys wanted to see was
a fight. Ever consider that?

439
00:29:27,496 --> 00:29:30,279
Better tell Logan
to walk softly with Bragg.

440
00:29:30,344 --> 00:29:32,286
Tell Bragg to walk softly.

441
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:37,345
Bragg is nothing
but a low-down skunk.

442
00:29:37,865 --> 00:29:39,240
Oh, come, Dr. Balance.

443
00:29:39,306 --> 00:29:41,762
Honey Bragg's
a sort of friend of mine.

444
00:29:41,835 --> 00:29:43,974
You have
strange friends, Jack.

445
00:29:44,235 --> 00:29:47,531
Well, I didn't say that I
like him or that I trust him.

446
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,701
What's your idea
of a friend?

447
00:29:49,804 --> 00:29:52,226
Any man, I suppose,
who believes as I do

448
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:54,571
that the human race
is a horrible mistake.

449
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:00,549
Always damp. Always cold.

450
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:03,753
Isn't there any heat
anywhere in the world?

451
00:30:03,823 --> 00:30:05,100
Good night.

452
00:30:06,927 --> 00:30:08,967
Coming my way, Howison?
Mmm.

453
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,633
Good night, Marta.

454
00:30:12,272 --> 00:30:13,734
Coming, George?

455
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:28,178
I hear there's going to be
a cabin-raising next week.

456
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:29,192
Whose?

457
00:30:29,268 --> 00:30:32,204
Some young couple who apparently
disagree with your husband's theories

458
00:30:32,277 --> 00:30:35,661
about perpetuating the human
race. You'll come, won't you?

459
00:30:37,014 --> 00:30:39,382
Why do you play so high when
the cards are going against you?

460
00:30:39,447 --> 00:30:41,040
Oh, I'll get it back.

461
00:30:41,111 --> 00:30:42,966
Five or six good hands
in a night.

462
00:30:43,032 --> 00:30:44,820
Jack can't always be
that lucky.

463
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:46,316
You're a fool.

464
00:30:46,647 --> 00:30:49,517
Censure on your lips,
solicitude in your eyes.

465
00:30:49,592 --> 00:30:51,632
Is that really for me,
Marta?

466
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:55,063
You're always reading things
in the way I look at you.

467
00:30:55,129 --> 00:30:57,169
The things I'd like to read.

468
00:30:57,498 --> 00:30:59,441
They're not there, George.

469
00:30:59,515 --> 00:31:00,824
How's Lucy?

470
00:31:02,619 --> 00:31:03,829
Adorable.

471
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,148
Good night, Marta.
Good night.

472
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,367
Hurry up!

473
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:23,545
There it goes!
There it goes!

474
00:31:29,825 --> 00:31:31,712
There, I think
that's wide enough.

475
00:31:31,776 --> 00:31:34,460
That's big enough
for anybody's fireplace.

476
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,183
Here's your other door.

477
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,709
You can get out either side
in case you have trouble

478
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:41,884
with the Indians
or your woman.

479
00:31:41,955 --> 00:31:44,225
Oh, Mrs. Dance,
I just can't get over it.

480
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:46,234
All these people
coming from miles around,

481
00:31:46,308 --> 00:31:49,058
people we don't even know
giving their time and all

482
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:51,100
to build a house
for Gray and me.

483
00:31:51,173 --> 00:31:53,377
Yes, but don't forget it
means a lot to them, too.

484
00:31:53,446 --> 00:31:56,414
For sure. A neighbor,
a new family starting up.

485
00:31:57,031 --> 00:32:00,479
And another pair of hands to
stand off those red beasters.

486
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,277
Hold up!

487
00:32:17,898 --> 00:32:20,899
If you want to catch a man,
you've got to work at it.

488
00:32:20,971 --> 00:32:22,979
I want no man
I have to catch.

489
00:32:23,052 --> 00:32:26,401
Why, sure. You catch him
and he catches you.

490
00:32:26,476 --> 00:32:28,419
A man always figures
that he does the catching.

491
00:32:28,493 --> 00:32:30,882
The truth is, it's the woman
that brings him up on the rope,

492
00:32:30,957 --> 00:32:32,648
him not quite knowing it.

493
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,092
Is that the way
you got Mrs. Dance?

494
00:32:34,158 --> 00:32:35,914
Sure.
But she gave me the sign.

495
00:32:35,982 --> 00:32:38,219
You've gotta give a man
the sign.

496
00:32:38,735 --> 00:32:40,262
Maybe that's so.

497
00:32:42,384 --> 00:32:43,594
Whoa, boy.

498
00:32:50,161 --> 00:32:52,300
Let's stroll down
by the river.

499
00:32:53,394 --> 00:32:55,304
I thought we came here
to help, George.

500
00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:58,161
Doesn't this scene
of domesticity inspire you?

501
00:32:58,228 --> 00:33:00,562
Not to sweat
over a hammer and saw.

502
00:33:00,692 --> 00:33:05,067
But it does inspire me to stretch out
in the shade with my head on your lap.

503
00:33:45,949 --> 00:33:49,080
This will be a handy place
for your woodpile, Liza.

504
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:28,037
Oh, it's so peaceful here.

505
00:34:28,102 --> 00:34:30,655
Mmm. The illusion
of peace is upon it.

506
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,924
You sound rather jaded.

507
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,227
Oh, these cabin-raisings
jade me.

508
00:34:36,999 --> 00:34:41,222
People planting themselves in one
rough spot for the rest of their lives.

509
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,932
I'm more for mansions
and plush furniture.

510
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:46,343
What I wouldn't give
right now

511
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:49,312
to be in an expensive
restaurant in Boston or New York.

512
00:34:49,386 --> 00:34:50,847
Mmm, with music playing.

513
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:54,567
And you in a maroon waistcoat
and me in an elegant green gown.

514
00:34:54,795 --> 00:34:58,570
Ah, Lucy, there's so much of
this world that we're missing.

515
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,795
Perhaps, George, if you took
things a bit more seriously.

516
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,250
You mean like Logan?
Always figuring.

517
00:35:05,486 --> 00:35:07,428
More stores,
more mules...

518
00:35:07,502 --> 00:35:10,350
What I mean is, if you
didn't gamble so much.

519
00:35:10,735 --> 00:35:13,638
This is a gambling country.
Everybody gambles.

520
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,086
Even Logan gambles,
doesn't he,

521
00:35:15,151 --> 00:35:16,777
every time he sends out
a pack train?

522
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:17,863
That's different.

523
00:35:17,936 --> 00:35:19,180
Well, we're different.

524
00:35:19,248 --> 00:35:23,045
He's not responsible for his
character and neither am I for mine.

525
00:35:23,761 --> 00:35:26,827
You know, I feel that sometimes
you make a comparison between us

526
00:35:26,897 --> 00:35:28,686
that leaves me
at a disadvantage.

527
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:29,998
George,
don't complicate things.

528
00:35:30,066 --> 00:35:32,008
Let's keep them simple
and straight.

529
00:35:32,082 --> 00:35:35,116
Mmm, my thoughts rarely
travel in a straight line.

530
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,609
How about your affections?

531
00:35:37,972 --> 00:35:42,545
My affections, always,
where you're concerned Lucy.

532
00:35:42,613 --> 00:35:44,468
Oh, George.

533
00:35:45,846 --> 00:35:48,367
God bless the hands
that built it,

534
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,610
and the two
that it was built for,

535
00:35:50,678 --> 00:35:55,152
and may they prosper and live in
peace all the days of their lives.

536
00:36:09,178 --> 00:36:13,172
Those whom God has joined
together, let no man put asunder.

537
00:36:13,403 --> 00:36:15,640
For as much as
Gray and Liza here

538
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:18,261
have consented together
in holy wedlock,

539
00:36:18,492 --> 00:36:21,809
and have witnessed the same
before God and this company

540
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,810
and thereto have given and pledged
their troth each to the other,

541
00:36:26,334 --> 00:36:28,822
I pronounce
that they are man and wife.

542
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:33,463
In the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

543
00:36:33,535 --> 00:36:34,779
Amen.

544
00:36:34,847 --> 00:36:37,084
Now kiss her, son,
and let's eat.

545
00:36:45,058 --> 00:36:46,913
Where were you, Hi?
What kept you?

546
00:36:46,978 --> 00:36:47,960
Well, the work all done?

547
00:36:48,034 --> 00:36:49,595
Yeah, you timed it
just right, Hi.

548
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:50,976
Cabin's all raised.

549
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:53,694
The couple's spliced and ready to
raise a cabin full of young'uns.

550
00:36:53,763 --> 00:36:55,803
Well, I couldn't find Mandy.

551
00:37:06,438 --> 00:37:07,932
Soy bean.

552
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:12,966
Soy bean.

553
00:37:14,407 --> 00:37:16,775
It's nice to have
a place of your own

554
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,361
and know your children'll
grow up there.

555
00:37:19,753 --> 00:37:22,983
If they're boys, I'd want
them to take up land nearby.

556
00:37:23,657 --> 00:37:25,513
If they're girls, I'd want
them to marry neighbors

557
00:37:25,578 --> 00:37:27,139
and not move off.

558
00:37:28,683 --> 00:37:30,472
When I'm dead, I'd like
them to stand where I stood

559
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,427
and see the things I saw.

560
00:37:32,492 --> 00:37:36,071
Yes, but the man you get might
not want to stay in one place.

561
00:37:36,972 --> 00:37:39,361
Would it make you unhappy
to move away?

562
00:37:39,436 --> 00:37:41,804
It would be hard to be
always fixing a new cabin

563
00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:43,844
and starting a new garden.

564
00:37:47,022 --> 00:37:48,932
Do you like Jacksonville,
Logan?

565
00:37:49,007 --> 00:37:51,146
It's a place
to do business in.

566
00:37:51,663 --> 00:37:54,598
Folks say you make money,
but you're always risking it.

567
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,745
I never pay much attention
to money.

568
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,337
And you're restless,
everybody says so.

569
00:38:00,465 --> 00:38:02,058
Yes, I guess I am.

570
00:38:04,946 --> 00:38:08,525
It's easy to be that way if
you've nothing to keep you home.

571
00:38:12,532 --> 00:38:15,696
How about it, folks? Up on
your feet. Grab a partner.

572
00:38:17,013 --> 00:38:20,363
<i>Sing it way up high
like a robin in the sky</i>

573
00:38:20,502 --> 00:38:23,764
<i>And tell them I'm getting
married in the morning</i>

574
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:27,603
<i>Put all your cares aside, come
and kiss the blushing bride</i>

575
00:38:27,671 --> 00:38:30,967
<i>'Cause honey, I'm getting
married in the morning</i>

576
00:38:31,223 --> 00:38:34,453
<i>You ought to see
who promised to be mine</i>

577
00:38:35,128 --> 00:38:36,819
Here you are,
whiskey or water!

578
00:38:36,888 --> 00:38:38,481
You can't dance
without sweating!

579
00:38:38,552 --> 00:38:40,375
<i>Lift up your hearts and shout</i>

580
00:38:40,441 --> 00:38:42,646
<i>So that the news
will get about</i>

581
00:38:42,714 --> 00:38:45,682
<i>'Cause, honey, I'm getting
married in the morning</i>

582
00:38:45,755 --> 00:38:47,031
That's it now!

583
00:39:01,054 --> 00:39:04,371
<i>Sing it way up high
like a robin in the sky</i>

584
00:39:04,447 --> 00:39:07,611
<i>And tell them I'm getting
married in the morning</i>

585
00:39:07,711 --> 00:39:09,401
<i>We'll pass
the little brown jug</i>

586
00:39:09,471 --> 00:39:11,260
<i>But bring a fiddle
and a mug</i>

587
00:39:11,327 --> 00:39:14,590
<i>'Cause, honey, I'm getting
married in the morning</i>

588
00:39:14,656 --> 00:39:17,559
<i>Why you can hitch old Dobbin
to the shay</i>

589
00:39:17,985 --> 00:39:21,531
<i>And bring the family out
for a lovely day, hey!</i>

590
00:39:21,602 --> 00:39:25,280
<i>Lift up your hearts and sing
when the church bells start...</i>

591
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,205
What you want?

592
00:39:58,537 --> 00:39:59,617
It's the same old story.

593
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,665
They don't mind us
coming here.

594
00:40:01,737 --> 00:40:04,455
It's like he says,
mother earth is for all.

595
00:40:04,586 --> 00:40:08,035
What they don't like is the
cabin. That makes the land ours.

596
00:40:08,107 --> 00:40:10,311
We got to live, too.
That's right.

597
00:40:57,366 --> 00:40:58,893
Where's my boys?

598
00:40:59,414 --> 00:41:01,269
We've been watching them,
they got no guns.

599
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,440
Yeah, they got no guns.
Good boys.

600
00:41:03,511 --> 00:41:05,169
Now you stay by me.

601
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,255
Better hit it up, boys.

602
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:22,838
What are you thinking, Logan?

603
00:41:22,971 --> 00:41:26,965
Oh, I was just thinking of what you
said awhile ago, the years ahead.

604
00:41:28,604 --> 00:41:31,801
Caroline, do you like me well
enough to make a marriage of it?

605
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,461
Yes, Logan, I do.

606
00:41:38,461 --> 00:41:41,309
Caroline, it's time
to pick up and go.

607
00:41:45,183 --> 00:41:47,071
You're a good man, Logan.

608
00:41:47,136 --> 00:41:49,144
And you've got a good girl.

609
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,929
Logan! Why that's great.

610
00:41:59,523 --> 00:42:01,760
I know
you'll be happy, Caroline.

611
00:42:02,852 --> 00:42:04,379
Thank you, Lucy.

612
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:09,501
You see, there's nothing to
it when you give him the sign.

613
00:42:16,966 --> 00:42:18,177
Soy bean.

614
00:42:22,535 --> 00:42:23,996
Soy bean.

615
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:04,042
Morning, Mr. Logan.
You're up early.

616
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:08,107
What's on your mind?

617
00:43:08,817 --> 00:43:10,410
Let's have a drink.

618
00:43:10,481 --> 00:43:11,943
It's too early.

619
00:43:18,899 --> 00:43:20,809
I'm thirsty early or not.

620
00:43:21,203 --> 00:43:23,308
Lots of places up the street.

621
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,468
Well, a drink's a drink.

622
00:43:44,567 --> 00:43:46,543
I want you and Morrow to pull
out for Salem this afternoon.

623
00:43:46,616 --> 00:43:47,794
McLane's freight.

624
00:43:47,864 --> 00:43:49,687
Thirty mules.
All right.

625
00:43:50,937 --> 00:43:53,326
What's hit you, Vane?
Let's have it.

626
00:43:55,194 --> 00:43:56,689
All right, I'll tell you.

627
00:43:56,762 --> 00:43:59,894
She don't like big towns.
She don't like big ideas.

628
00:44:00,923 --> 00:44:03,411
She don't like
moving around and changing.

629
00:44:03,484 --> 00:44:05,077
It's her choice.

630
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,188
You're not the man for her.

631
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,836
I'm sorry the way it
turned out for you, Vane.

632
00:44:12,542 --> 00:44:14,485
I didn't mean to bust out.

633
00:44:15,871 --> 00:44:17,595
Let's load the boxes.

634
00:44:22,624 --> 00:44:24,381
Bragg's up at Stutchell's.

635
00:44:24,449 --> 00:44:26,783
They're all expecting you
up there.

636
00:44:27,937 --> 00:44:29,661
You might as well go.

637
00:44:29,921 --> 00:44:32,343
The town won't have it
any other way.

638
00:44:32,706 --> 00:44:34,081
How about it, Logan?

639
00:44:34,146 --> 00:44:36,251
You got a bet on this,
Johnny?

640
00:44:36,482 --> 00:44:38,239
Yeah, a small one.

641
00:44:38,307 --> 00:44:39,714
Which way?

642
00:44:40,388 --> 00:44:42,046
Which do you think?

643
00:44:45,412 --> 00:44:46,842
He'll get your eyes
if he can.

644
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:48,772
Kill him
and be done with it.

645
00:44:48,837 --> 00:44:50,364
You too, Clench?

646
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:55,485
Come on,
it's gonna be a slaughter.

647
00:44:55,558 --> 00:44:56,988
He can't whip Bragg.
Nobody can.

648
00:44:57,063 --> 00:44:58,471
How much have you got
that says so?

649
00:44:58,535 --> 00:45:00,445
I've got a hundred.
Well, put it up.

650
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,593
You want a hunk of this,
Linnet?

651
00:45:02,665 --> 00:45:04,126
No, I'm not betting.

652
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,477
Did you ever see
Bragg's arms?

653
00:45:05,545 --> 00:45:07,913
I seen him bust a
two-by-four over his knee.

654
00:45:07,978 --> 00:45:10,051
I seen him break four
of Jed Peters' ribs.

655
00:45:10,122 --> 00:45:11,911
He ain't got a chance.

656
00:45:31,181 --> 00:45:33,571
Give me a bottle, Harry,
a full one.

657
00:45:41,232 --> 00:45:42,891
I left my gun home.

658
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,844
I brought mine along.

659
00:45:49,682 --> 00:45:51,886
Let's make this
a fair fight, Logan.

660
00:45:51,954 --> 00:45:53,897
I've got nothing
against you.

661
00:45:53,971 --> 00:45:55,663
It's the boys
that want the fun.

662
00:45:55,732 --> 00:45:57,423
You're lying, Bragg.

663
00:45:57,684 --> 00:45:59,277
What have you got against me?

664
00:45:59,348 --> 00:46:00,875
You ought to know.

665
00:46:00,948 --> 00:46:03,795
You're talking in riddles,
Logan. What's on your mind?

666
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:06,730
A picture of a tree,
with you swinging from it.

667
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:08,529
You hear that, Stutchell?

668
00:46:08,597 --> 00:46:10,256
Yeah. Yeah, I hear.

669
00:46:10,966 --> 00:46:12,876
What's the matter, Harry?

670
00:46:17,495 --> 00:46:20,081
Now you've got him.
Beat his brains out.

671
00:46:22,553 --> 00:46:25,619
That's all right, Logan.
I'll get you in a minute.

672
00:46:30,842 --> 00:46:33,713
That's all right, Logan.
I'll break your back.

673
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,794
Now, we can close in, Bragg.

674
00:46:35,868 --> 00:46:37,297
You think I won't?

675
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:55,031
Now I've got you!

676
00:47:11,715 --> 00:47:14,104
Over here, Bragg.
Over here.

677
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,922
Time to put out the light!

678
00:47:37,672 --> 00:47:38,720
Dogs.

679
00:47:39,624 --> 00:47:40,966
Yellow dogs.

680
00:47:54,059 --> 00:47:55,620
You surprised me.

681
00:47:59,597 --> 00:48:01,702
Oh, that was great, Logan!
Great!

682
00:48:01,773 --> 00:48:04,196
Now you can
collect your bet, Johnny.

683
00:48:04,974 --> 00:48:06,796
He'll be after you
the rest of your life.

684
00:48:06,862 --> 00:48:08,073
Why didn't you kill him?

685
00:48:08,143 --> 00:48:10,216
Would that have been
more fun, Lucy?

686
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:12,556
That's what you all came
for, isn't it? Excitement?

687
00:48:12,624 --> 00:48:15,046
If that's the way you feel,
you didn't have to fight him.

688
00:48:15,121 --> 00:48:16,615
Sure,
I could have backed down

689
00:48:16,689 --> 00:48:19,144
and turned the whole town
over to Bragg.

690
00:48:19,216 --> 00:48:21,802
But all it meant
to any of you is a show.

691
00:48:32,019 --> 00:48:33,546
Logan! Look out!

692
00:48:38,996 --> 00:48:41,964
You should take my advice and
put some raw meat on those eyes.

693
00:48:42,037 --> 00:48:44,624
They'll be all right.
It's just bruises.

694
00:48:45,526 --> 00:48:47,250
Nothing I can do for you?

695
00:48:47,318 --> 00:48:48,496
Yes, one thing.

696
00:48:48,567 --> 00:48:50,575
Quit playing poker, George.

697
00:48:51,544 --> 00:48:53,748
Quit poker? What for?

698
00:48:54,808 --> 00:48:57,842
You can't afford it
if you have to give out IOUs.

699
00:48:58,681 --> 00:49:01,235
Poker's the only relaxation
I get around here.

700
00:49:01,306 --> 00:49:04,089
Mighty expensive relaxation
at $500 a throw.

701
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:08,879
George, what's got
into you, lately?

702
00:49:10,523 --> 00:49:12,628
Oh, I don't know.
It's just...

703
00:49:12,732 --> 00:49:15,034
I'm sick
of this godforsaken hole.

704
00:49:15,163 --> 00:49:17,750
It's all right for you, you're
rich. You've got your own business.

705
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:19,447
You're not gonna get rich
at Lestrade's.

706
00:49:19,517 --> 00:49:21,851
You'll end up
owing him your shirt.

707
00:49:23,197 --> 00:49:25,402
He's practically
got it already.

708
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,638
George, are you in trouble?

709
00:49:27,743 --> 00:49:29,434
How much do you owe?

710
00:49:30,399 --> 00:49:33,880
Oh, at one place and another,
a couple of thousand, maybe.

711
00:49:44,419 --> 00:49:46,427
Let me have $2,000, Clench.

712
00:49:47,363 --> 00:49:49,054
$2,000? What for?

713
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,747
Grubstake.
Grubstake.

714
00:49:52,996 --> 00:49:55,003
So that's what you call it.

715
00:50:07,622 --> 00:50:09,565
What's this?
Pay them off.

716
00:50:10,055 --> 00:50:12,773
Just give me your word
you'll quit, George.

717
00:50:13,768 --> 00:50:16,551
Well, if you insist, but
it'll be a mighty dull world.

718
00:50:16,616 --> 00:50:19,519
Sure, but a man whose business is
handling other people's money...

719
00:50:19,594 --> 00:50:22,726
Must be above suspicion.
Yes, I guess you're right.

720
00:50:24,362 --> 00:50:26,185
But I wish
I didn't have to take this.

721
00:50:26,251 --> 00:50:27,528
Don't feel that way
about it.

722
00:50:27,595 --> 00:50:29,635
That's what friends are for.

723
00:50:29,803 --> 00:50:30,851
Sure.

724
00:50:40,141 --> 00:50:44,136
<i>And long before
the stars skedaddle</i>

725
00:50:45,678 --> 00:50:49,541
<i>I'll be with my love tonight</i>

726
00:50:51,343 --> 00:50:54,192
<i>She'll be in the gloaming</i>

727
00:50:54,257 --> 00:50:56,559
<i>Where all heaven beams</i>

728
00:50:56,881 --> 00:50:59,565
<i>And out there in the gloaming</i>

729
00:50:59,633 --> 00:51:02,187
<i>We'll find the trail of dreams</i>

730
00:51:02,514 --> 00:51:06,923
<i>I'm riding on a silver saddle</i>

731
00:51:08,404 --> 00:51:12,682
<i>The moon is my silver saddle</i>

732
00:51:14,261 --> 00:51:18,485
<i>And long before
the stars skedaddle</i>

733
00:51:19,862 --> 00:51:24,369
<i>I'll be with my love tonight</i>

734
00:51:25,623 --> 00:51:28,209
<i>Me and my old Daisy</i>

735
00:51:28,407 --> 00:51:30,797
<i>Up there in the sky</i>

736
00:51:30,903 --> 00:51:33,653
<i>And my heart beating crazy</i>

737
00:51:33,848 --> 00:51:36,566
<i>But it's no wonder why</i>

738
00:51:45,787 --> 00:51:46,900
Heads.

739
00:52:12,897 --> 00:52:15,767
I wish I was 10,000 miles
from this place.

740
00:52:16,353 --> 00:52:17,847
It wouldn't make
any difference, George.

741
00:52:17,921 --> 00:52:20,311
You'd be the same
wherever you were.

742
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:22,621
Wouldn't you miss me, Marta?

743
00:52:22,691 --> 00:52:25,212
Why should I?
You've got Lucy.

744
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:26,490
Have I?

745
00:52:26,563 --> 00:52:28,451
If you haven't,
it's your own fault.

746
00:52:28,515 --> 00:52:29,726
Of course.

747
00:52:29,796 --> 00:52:31,203
But a woman
is supposed to love a man

748
00:52:31,268 --> 00:52:33,178
because of his faults,
isn't she?

749
00:52:33,253 --> 00:52:34,431
Some women.

750
00:52:34,501 --> 00:52:35,811
But not you?

751
00:52:37,446 --> 00:52:39,486
Oh, Marta, don't be so hard.

752
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:41,093
Why can't we be friends?

753
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,173
Why?

754
00:52:42,695 --> 00:52:45,184
Why can't you be a friend
to yourself?

755
00:53:18,126 --> 00:53:19,818
How are you, Camrose?

756
00:53:20,847 --> 00:53:23,214
Mclver,
what are you doing in town?

757
00:53:23,311 --> 00:53:24,773
I just blew In.

758
00:53:26,192 --> 00:53:27,916
I didn't expect you
for another month.

759
00:53:27,985 --> 00:53:29,359
Well, I didn't have
any luck.

760
00:53:29,425 --> 00:53:32,556
I just wore out shoe leather.
I'll buy you a drink.

761
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:35,279
Thanks. Thanks, I can't.

762
00:53:52,213 --> 00:53:53,325
I'll see you tomorrow.

763
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:55,918
I want to get my dust
out of your safe.

764
00:53:56,598 --> 00:53:58,322
Sure. Any time.

765
00:53:59,575 --> 00:54:03,667
<i>Happy all of their lives</i>

766
00:54:03,735 --> 00:54:05,262
Hello, Mack! How are you?

767
00:54:05,336 --> 00:54:07,890
Hello, Mclver.
How are you?

768
00:54:09,177 --> 00:54:12,025
<i>If you be happy</i>

769
00:54:12,537 --> 00:54:15,572
<i>Don't ever wed</i>

770
00:54:15,674 --> 00:54:19,832
<i>Just stay a free man</i>

771
00:54:19,899 --> 00:54:21,273
I gotta go home, fellows.

772
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,063
Oh, no, Mack.
Come on.

773
00:54:23,131 --> 00:54:25,466
No, I gotta go home.
I gotta go home.

774
00:54:25,533 --> 00:54:26,939
Come on, Johnny.
Let him go.

775
00:54:27,004 --> 00:54:28,827
You don't know
what you're missing, Mclver.

776
00:54:28,892 --> 00:54:30,900
<i>Don't ever wed</i>

777
00:54:34,909 --> 00:54:37,463
<i>Till you are dead</i>

778
00:54:37,662 --> 00:54:40,663
<i>If you be happy</i>

779
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:43,932
<i>Don't ever wed</i>

780
00:55:23,752 --> 00:55:26,982
Go away?
Leave Jacksonville? When?

781
00:55:27,368 --> 00:55:30,020
Tomorrow, the day after,
as soon as we can.

782
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:31,748
But why this
sudden decision, George?

783
00:55:31,817 --> 00:55:35,201
Nothing sudden. It's just
that I'm fed up with this hole.

784
00:55:35,274 --> 00:55:36,420
It's a place
to strike it rich

785
00:55:36,491 --> 00:55:39,721
and if you don't, you should
try your luck someplace else.

786
00:55:39,788 --> 00:55:41,893
Luck doesn't depend
on a place.

787
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:44,267
George, can't you
be content here?

788
00:55:44,396 --> 00:55:45,738
No, I can't.

789
00:55:46,605 --> 00:55:48,548
Let's go in. You're upset.

790
00:55:49,965 --> 00:55:53,796
Lucy, I'm going.
And you're going with me.

791
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:55,916
You promised to marry me,
didn't you?

792
00:55:55,983 --> 00:55:57,576
Yes.
Well, when?

793
00:55:59,471 --> 00:56:00,518
Whenever you want.

794
00:56:00,591 --> 00:56:02,599
Sunday, this Sunday.
Oh, no.

795
00:56:03,024 --> 00:56:04,617
I'll have to make a dress.

796
00:56:04,688 --> 00:56:06,249
Is a dress a marriage?

797
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,296
Lucy, when did you say?

798
00:56:08,625 --> 00:56:09,770
Sunday?

799
00:56:10,802 --> 00:56:12,689
As soon as
she can make a dress.

800
00:56:12,754 --> 00:56:14,663
Hello, Logan.
Hello, Lucy.

801
00:56:15,634 --> 00:56:17,609
Well, George, I'm off to
San Francisco in the morning,

802
00:56:17,683 --> 00:56:19,658
I stopped by to have a
word with you in private.

803
00:56:19,731 --> 00:56:20,779
Sure.

804
00:56:24,853 --> 00:56:26,380
What's the matter, dear?
Nothing.

805
00:56:26,453 --> 00:56:28,526
Is it true that you and George
are really getting married?

806
00:56:28,598 --> 00:56:30,769
Yes.
Oh, but why the haste?

807
00:56:30,838 --> 00:56:32,082
George wants to go away.

808
00:56:32,151 --> 00:56:33,712
But, dear...

809
00:56:33,782 --> 00:56:36,117
Where are you to find material
for a dress in this camp?

810
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:38,835
Yes, and besides, I always said
that when my daughter got married,

811
00:56:38,904 --> 00:56:41,293
she'd have the finest
wedding in the territory.

812
00:56:41,368 --> 00:56:43,789
I'll even get the Governor
to come down.

813
00:56:43,864 --> 00:56:44,912
I'll tell you what.

814
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:46,992
Why don't you go along
with Logan to San Francisco?

815
00:56:47,064 --> 00:56:48,690
No.
Oh, but why not, dear?

816
00:56:48,761 --> 00:56:51,762
There are any number
of French dressmakers there.

817
00:56:52,314 --> 00:56:54,454
I ought to
knock your head off.

818
00:56:54,971 --> 00:56:55,919
What's the matter?

819
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:58,385
You gave me your word
you'd quit poker.

820
00:56:58,459 --> 00:57:00,053
Yes, Logan, I did.

821
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:02,420
I had every intention
of keeping it.

822
00:57:02,492 --> 00:57:04,729
The devil tempted you,
I suppose.

823
00:57:04,956 --> 00:57:05,971
Yes.

824
00:57:06,525 --> 00:57:08,729
The devil with green eyes.
Envy.

825
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:11,065
Envy of you, Logan.
That's no answer.

826
00:57:11,198 --> 00:57:13,206
Maybe it's the only answer.

827
00:57:13,567 --> 00:57:15,902
But don't worry,
I'll pay you back.

828
00:57:15,967 --> 00:57:17,396
I don't care
about the money, George.

829
00:57:17,472 --> 00:57:18,650
I do.

830
00:57:19,648 --> 00:57:22,966
I'm pulling out, going
someplace else and make a strike.

831
00:57:23,681 --> 00:57:26,464
Pulling out
and taking Lucy with you?

832
00:57:27,489 --> 00:57:29,083
Lucy's my concern.

833
00:57:29,507 --> 00:57:32,506
Not if you're going to make her
life a thing of running and hunting.

834
00:57:32,578 --> 00:57:34,553
Does she concern you
that much?

835
00:57:34,626 --> 00:57:36,056
Yes, she does.

836
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:37,532
I see.

837
00:57:37,763 --> 00:57:39,105
Logan.

838
00:57:40,132 --> 00:57:41,823
About San Francisco,

839
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:44,803
would you mind
having a woman on your hands?

840
00:57:47,717 --> 00:57:48,895
Why, no.

841
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:51,139
I have to get a dress.

842
00:57:52,743 --> 00:57:54,980
You'll be
in good company, Lucy.

843
00:57:55,047 --> 00:57:56,803
I'm starting early,
I have to stop at Dance's.

844
00:57:56,872 --> 00:57:58,116
Aren't you staying for supper?

845
00:57:58,184 --> 00:58:00,421
I can't.
I have something to do.

846
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:08,744
Why, hello, stranger.

847
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:11,080
How much did you take off
Camrose last night?

848
00:58:11,147 --> 00:58:14,825
About 1,500 in gold,
another 1,500 in a note.

849
00:58:18,283 --> 00:58:19,745
I want it back.

850
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:23,141
You have a streak in you
about Camrose.

851
00:58:23,277 --> 00:58:24,706
For me,
he's strictly a tinhorn.

852
00:58:24,781 --> 00:58:27,269
Tinhorn or not,
I want the money back.

853
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:30,150
Look here, Logan,
my business is cards...

854
00:58:30,222 --> 00:58:32,011
You do too well at it.

855
00:58:32,207 --> 00:58:33,669
If that money's not
in Camrose's hands

856
00:58:33,743 --> 00:58:35,466
by the time I get back
from San Francisco,

857
00:58:35,535 --> 00:58:37,227
I'll come after you.

858
00:58:50,707 --> 00:58:52,398
Where are you going?

859
00:59:06,357 --> 00:59:07,535
Shut up!

860
00:59:08,726 --> 00:59:10,733
What do you want? I thought
it might interest you,

861
00:59:10,806 --> 00:59:13,425
Logan Stuart's
leaving for San Francisco.

862
00:59:13,912 --> 00:59:15,919
Well, come on in.

863
00:59:23,929 --> 00:59:25,937
Where are you bound for
this time, Logan?

864
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:29,010
For San Francisco, to see
if I can borrow some money.

865
00:59:29,082 --> 00:59:30,511
Are you in trouble, Logan?

866
00:59:30,587 --> 00:59:31,667
The trouble is my business,

867
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:34,522
like young Asa here,
always outgrowing his pants.

868
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:36,922
You're a moving around man,
Logan.

869
00:59:37,372 --> 00:59:40,689
Well, the hound that rustles
always catches the rabbit.

870
00:59:40,894 --> 00:59:44,506
And there are hounds always lean
and hungry from running too much.

871
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,322
Aimed at you, my boy.

872
00:59:49,054 --> 00:59:52,470
I'm sure Logan didn't stop by
here to see you wash dishes.

873
01:00:14,724 --> 01:00:17,790
Is she going to San Francisco
to borrow money, too?

874
01:00:17,925 --> 01:00:19,135
Jealous?

875
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:22,975
Should I be?
No.

876
01:00:25,671 --> 01:00:28,486
Logan, there's nothing
to delay us, is there?

877
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,502
Not a thing.

878
01:00:32,232 --> 01:00:33,824
When's it going to be?

879
01:00:33,895 --> 01:00:35,652
Just as soon as I get back.

880
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,444
In a couple of weeks.

881
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:06,252
What's that?

882
01:01:09,872 --> 01:01:10,919
Down.

883
01:02:41,411 --> 01:02:43,321
He had to kill something.

884
01:02:43,907 --> 01:02:46,941
We'd better hide the saddles
and get out of here.

885
01:03:00,006 --> 01:03:02,341
We'll have to make it
back on foot.

886
01:03:04,295 --> 01:03:06,783
Another hard time
for you to remember.

887
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:18,851
That's what you wanted, wasn't it? Yes.

888
01:03:18,922 --> 01:03:20,329
Then don't look at me
like that.

889
01:03:20,394 --> 01:03:22,053
Lucy, this is no good.
You're lying.

890
01:03:22,123 --> 01:03:24,741
Logan, I want to get things straight
between us before it's too late.

891
01:03:24,811 --> 01:03:26,241
It's too late.

892
01:03:31,245 --> 01:03:34,213
Maybe we can borrow a
couple of horses at Elkton.

893
01:04:53,629 --> 01:04:57,885
Well, I'm sorry about
your wedding dress, Lucy.

894
01:04:57,951 --> 01:04:59,544
Any dress will do.

895
01:05:02,304 --> 01:05:03,548
What brought you back?

896
01:05:03,616 --> 01:05:05,045
I ran into
a little trouble, Clench.

897
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,739
Mmm. The world is rocking
with trouble this morning.

898
01:05:07,809 --> 01:05:09,630
Your world in particular,
Logan.

899
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:12,086
They've taken Camrose in
for murder.

900
01:05:12,993 --> 01:05:14,815
Murder?
Mack Mclver.

901
01:05:14,881 --> 01:05:16,573
They found him drowned
in the creek.

902
01:05:16,642 --> 01:05:18,552
Looked like an accident
at first.

903
01:05:18,626 --> 01:05:21,213
But Johnny Steele and Hi
Linnet got to working on it.

904
01:05:21,283 --> 01:05:22,712
Where is George?

905
01:05:22,787 --> 01:05:25,919
They're holding court on
him now up at Stutchell's.

906
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:31,232
And it grew on me that Camrose
was tampering with the dust

907
01:05:31,301 --> 01:05:33,189
the boys left
with the company.

908
01:05:33,253 --> 01:05:34,977
He was losing a lot of money
at poker...

909
01:05:35,046 --> 01:05:37,152
That's hearsay,
Johnny.

910
01:05:37,575 --> 01:05:39,364
What's wrong with hearsay
if it's true?

911
01:05:39,431 --> 01:05:40,576
Johnny,

912
01:05:41,255 --> 01:05:42,979
what have I got here?

913
01:05:44,008 --> 01:05:45,536
A silver dollar.

914
01:05:46,185 --> 01:05:47,778
Are you certain of it?

915
01:05:47,849 --> 01:05:49,257
Dead certain.

916
01:05:50,922 --> 01:05:53,159
Howison, what does it
look like to you?

917
01:05:53,226 --> 01:05:55,975
You're was time, Hi.
It's a plain old U.S. dollar.

918
01:05:56,041 --> 01:05:58,562
Well, you're mistaken.
It's a Mexican dollar.

919
01:06:00,267 --> 01:06:03,912
You see, Johnny? What you don't see
yourself, you can't swear to be true.

920
01:06:03,979 --> 01:06:07,144
You can't always swear
that what you do see is true.

921
01:06:07,501 --> 01:06:10,152
Well, anyway, Camrose was
losing a lot of money at poker...

922
01:06:10,221 --> 01:06:11,399
Hearsay, Johnny.

923
01:06:11,469 --> 01:06:14,023
You're trying a man
for his life.

924
01:06:14,094 --> 01:06:16,483
Life is precious
to all of you, isn't it?

925
01:06:16,558 --> 01:06:18,151
Well, it's precious
to George Camrose.

926
01:06:18,223 --> 01:06:20,907
Life was good to Mclver, too,
and it was took from him.

927
01:06:20,975 --> 01:06:22,983
Was it? Well, that's what
we're here to find out.

928
01:06:23,056 --> 01:06:25,610
A murder trial calls for a proper
judge and jury, doesn't it, Jonas?

929
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:27,536
They understand that.
Course we do.

930
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:33,512
Get on with it.

931
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:35,181
Lestrade.

932
01:06:38,228 --> 01:06:41,162
Lestrade, did Camrose
play poker with you?

933
01:06:41,235 --> 01:06:42,544
Frequently.

934
01:06:42,772 --> 01:06:44,332
Did he lose money?

935
01:06:44,403 --> 01:06:45,680
Considerable.

936
01:06:45,748 --> 01:06:47,854
How much would you say
he lost?

937
01:06:47,925 --> 01:06:50,413
In the course of a year,
maybe $5,000.

938
01:06:51,893 --> 01:06:53,322
Where did you get it from?

939
01:06:53,398 --> 01:06:54,925
I won't say.
You've gotta say.

940
01:06:54,998 --> 01:06:57,552
You can't compel an accused
man to answer questions, Johnny.

941
01:06:57,623 --> 01:06:58,605
That's the law.

942
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:01,941
If a man's innocent, why should
he be afraid to answer questions?

943
01:07:02,008 --> 01:07:03,153
Linnet,

944
01:07:04,601 --> 01:07:07,023
did you ever see Camrose take
pokes out of the office safe

945
01:07:07,097 --> 01:07:08,853
and pour dust
from one to the other?

946
01:07:08,921 --> 01:07:10,132
Yes.
When?

947
01:07:10,778 --> 01:07:13,626
It was the night before
Mclver was found in the creek.

948
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:16,855
I happened to see a light and
I looked through the shutter.

949
01:07:16,923 --> 01:07:19,193
Do you make a habit
of spying on people?

950
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:22,075
No, but I've got a habit
of observing people.

951
01:07:22,236 --> 01:07:24,212
Is that all you have to do?

952
01:07:24,285 --> 01:07:26,804
Well, Logan, you've got
a big store and no time,

953
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:29,692
and I've got a little store
and lots of time.

954
01:07:31,198 --> 01:07:32,605
Order! Order!

955
01:07:33,342 --> 01:07:35,164
Get on with it, Johnny.

956
01:07:35,806 --> 01:07:37,083
All right.

957
01:07:37,247 --> 01:07:39,614
Now, then,
Mclver came into town.

958
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:43,582
The next morning, he was found
dead with his face in the creek.

959
01:07:43,681 --> 01:07:46,583
We didn't find any dust on
him, but we did find this,

960
01:07:46,657 --> 01:07:49,527
a receipt that Camrose
gave Mack for his dust.

961
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:56,353
That's your writing, George?
Yes.

962
01:07:56,579 --> 01:07:59,394
If you gave him his dust, why
didn't you take back the receipt?

963
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:00,954
I seldom give receipts.

964
01:08:01,028 --> 01:08:02,938
You remember, Johnny,
I never gave you one.

965
01:08:03,013 --> 01:08:04,442
I just put your dust
in the safe

966
01:08:04,517 --> 01:08:06,939
and when you asked for it,
you got it.

967
01:08:07,206 --> 01:08:10,305
It's been my usual custom,
all you boys know that.

968
01:08:13,094 --> 01:08:15,234
But Mclver wanted a receipt.

969
01:08:15,303 --> 01:08:17,921
I merely forgot to ask for it
when I gave him back his dust.

970
01:08:17,991 --> 01:08:19,552
Careless, I'd say.

971
01:08:19,719 --> 01:08:23,015
We're all careless with gold,
it's the cheapest thing in camp.

972
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,771
Is that all, Johnny?

973
01:08:25,449 --> 01:08:27,271
If so, it's not enough.

974
01:08:28,042 --> 01:08:31,010
On the testimony of a man
squinting through his shutter,

975
01:08:31,082 --> 01:08:33,734
you've tried to show
that Camrose is dishonest.

976
01:08:33,803 --> 01:08:35,975
And on the basis
of an unreturned receipt,

977
01:08:36,043 --> 01:08:38,312
you deny he gave Mclver
back his dust.

978
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:40,169
You've proved nothing.

979
01:08:44,878 --> 01:08:46,438
Tell them, Linnet.

980
01:08:46,605 --> 01:08:49,453
Well, he came into my store
a couple of days ago

981
01:08:49,518 --> 01:08:52,421
and traded me a nugget, and I
noticed it was shaped like a shamrock,

982
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:55,725
so I put it in a box, set it
up in my store for good luck.

983
01:08:55,792 --> 01:08:57,930
Why, that's Mack's lucky
piece. He always carried it.

984
01:08:57,999 --> 01:08:59,177
Shamrock. That's Mack's.

985
01:08:59,247 --> 01:09:00,295
I know that nugget.

986
01:09:00,368 --> 01:09:02,124
That's it.
Sure, it was Mack's.

987
01:09:02,192 --> 01:09:04,047
Well, there's the case,
Logan.

988
01:09:04,113 --> 01:09:05,804
Twist it if you can.

989
01:09:06,193 --> 01:09:07,720
Camrose could only
have gotten that nugget

990
01:09:07,793 --> 01:09:09,965
at a time
when Mack couldn't resist.

991
01:09:10,034 --> 01:09:12,369
In other words,
when Mack was dead.

992
01:09:12,627 --> 01:09:14,569
I make murder out of that.

993
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,770
Let's vote on it.
Let's vote.

994
01:09:19,476 --> 01:09:22,062
Just a moment.
Just a moment, all of you.

995
01:09:22,549 --> 01:09:24,524
This meeting has no sanction.

996
01:09:24,598 --> 01:09:27,762
If you vote this man guilty, you must
still hold him over to a regular court.

997
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,595
Remember this.

998
01:09:32,183 --> 01:09:34,672
Remember, if you vote this
man dead on that set of facts,

999
01:09:34,744 --> 01:09:36,206
you'll be setting the scene
for another day

1000
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:38,036
when you may be
voting yourself dead.

1001
01:09:38,104 --> 01:09:40,592
Vote!
Vote!

1002
01:09:40,665 --> 01:09:42,094
Let's vote!

1003
01:09:43,705 --> 01:09:46,389
All those who think he's guilty, say so.

1004
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:48,024
Guilty.

1005
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:53,206
Guilty.
Hurray!

1006
01:10:17,024 --> 01:10:19,261
Did you know about the nugget? No.

1007
01:10:27,586 --> 01:10:29,495
They'll hang him tonight.

1008
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:31,709
They'll just wait
till it's dark.

1009
01:10:31,778 --> 01:10:34,015
You've done
all you could, Logan.

1010
01:10:38,532 --> 01:10:40,420
Guilty.
Oh!

1011
01:10:42,693 --> 01:10:44,700
Dad, do you think
he did it?

1012
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:47,619
Well, he's a weak man.

1013
01:10:49,447 --> 01:10:51,836
Let's get along, Lucy.
Logan...

1014
01:10:51,911 --> 01:10:53,821
Lucy, Logan did everything
he could.

1015
01:10:53,896 --> 01:10:56,001
Don't ask him to do any more.

1016
01:11:12,076 --> 01:11:14,149
Don't give us any trouble,
Logan.

1017
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:17,383
It would be disagreeable, but
disagreeable or not, we'd shoot you.

1018
01:11:17,452 --> 01:11:19,787
That's plain.
I'm glad you told me.

1019
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:21,959
Don't do it, Logan.

1020
01:11:31,952 --> 01:11:33,741
You've done enough,
haven't you?

1021
01:11:33,808 --> 01:11:35,881
No man has to go
against reason.

1022
01:11:35,952 --> 01:11:37,097
Reason?

1023
01:11:37,649 --> 01:11:39,820
Is that what
makes a man hungry?

1024
01:11:39,889 --> 01:11:41,865
Is it reason
makes him fight

1025
01:11:41,938 --> 01:11:44,786
or sends him in to
Stutchell's to have a drink

1026
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:46,094
or makes him
stand by a friend?

1027
01:11:46,162 --> 01:11:48,072
What does make him, then?

1028
01:11:48,691 --> 01:11:50,796
Something deeper than reason.

1029
01:12:10,135 --> 01:12:12,274
The Indians have broken loose.

1030
01:12:19,129 --> 01:12:20,820
They've broken out.
How far did you come?

1031
01:12:20,889 --> 01:12:24,665
Well, I guess about 40 miles.
They're about 12 miles behind me here.

1032
01:12:29,756 --> 01:12:31,578
They are?
How far away are they?

1033
01:12:36,605 --> 01:12:39,573
They got their war paint on? Sure.

1034
01:12:40,414 --> 01:12:41,908
How big a party?

1035
01:12:48,478 --> 01:12:50,388
George, pull on the door.

1036
01:12:57,441 --> 01:12:59,481
Here. Take the black horse
in my barn.

1037
01:12:59,553 --> 01:13:02,423
Watch your chance, get up
to the hills and keep going.

1038
01:13:02,498 --> 01:13:04,408
Thanks, Logan.
Thanks for your confidence.

1039
01:13:04,483 --> 01:13:06,305
Don't flatter yourself.

1040
01:13:06,499 --> 01:13:08,539
What are you doing this for?

1041
01:13:09,636 --> 01:13:10,814
For Lucy's sake?

1042
01:13:10,884 --> 01:13:12,706
You don't want her to see
me strung up, is that it?

1043
01:13:12,773 --> 01:13:14,813
Something like that,
I guess.

1044
01:13:34,248 --> 01:13:36,835
Everything's on fire
all along the line.

1045
01:13:37,129 --> 01:13:38,984
My wife's dead
and my little girl's dead.

1046
01:13:39,050 --> 01:13:40,511
How many Indians
did you see?

1047
01:13:40,585 --> 01:13:42,015
Big band? Little band?

1048
01:13:42,089 --> 01:13:43,300
What made them break out?

1049
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:45,258
I couldn't say for sure.

1050
01:13:45,419 --> 01:13:48,616
The ferry man said it was on account
of Honey Bragg killing an Indian girl.

1051
01:13:48,683 --> 01:13:50,178
Which way are they heading?

1052
01:13:50,252 --> 01:13:51,714
Toward Dance's.

1053
01:13:52,397 --> 01:13:53,957
A man ought to be
tougher than that.

1054
01:13:54,028 --> 01:13:56,003
That's a fool remark,
Johnny.

1055
01:13:56,077 --> 01:13:57,834
We'll have to raise a company.
Sixty men or more.

1056
01:13:57,902 --> 01:13:59,790
Count me in.
Me, too.

1057
01:14:00,206 --> 01:14:02,116
I'll go.
On that mule?

1058
01:14:02,191 --> 01:14:03,849
She can run. Well, you
better stay here just in case.

1059
01:14:03,919 --> 01:14:04,902
Come on, let's go.

1060
01:14:04,975 --> 01:14:06,732
Just in case
they head this way.

1061
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,742
He's gone. He broke out.
Broke out? How?

1062
01:14:08,816 --> 01:14:11,632
He busted the lock.
Why didn't you watch him?

1063
01:14:14,193 --> 01:14:15,884
I warned you, Logan.

1064
01:14:18,738 --> 01:14:21,356
You're making
long guesses again, Johnny.

1065
01:14:22,226 --> 01:14:23,600
Whoever's going,
be here in 20 minutes.

1066
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:25,674
Grub enough for three days.

1067
01:14:26,451 --> 01:14:28,841
We'll take care
of you later, Logan.

1068
01:15:24,863 --> 01:15:27,352
There.
Now you can let it down.

1069
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,368
There we are.

1070
01:15:30,529 --> 01:15:33,017
Liza, you're just about the best
little helper a man ever had.

1071
01:15:33,089 --> 01:15:34,518
Oh.

1072
01:16:43,727 --> 01:16:44,774
All right.

1073
01:16:44,912 --> 01:16:46,254
How big an outfit
was it, Logan?

1074
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:49,550
Thirty mules. I wonder if
Morrow and Blazier got away.

1075
01:17:15,414 --> 01:17:16,691
Hello!

1076
01:17:23,447 --> 01:17:25,335
We were jumped, Logan,
Morrow was killed.

1077
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:26,545
How are things here?
Bad.

1078
01:17:26,616 --> 01:17:28,472
Mr. Dance is dead
and young Asa, too.

1079
01:17:28,537 --> 01:17:29,617
Where's Caroline?
She's gone.

1080
01:17:29,689 --> 01:17:30,834
She's up in the brush
hunting a cow.

1081
01:17:30,905 --> 01:17:33,655
I found her trail,
but I couldn't follow it.

1082
01:17:40,507 --> 01:17:43,443
I'll have coffee for you all
in a little while.

1083
01:17:43,644 --> 01:17:46,132
We'll take you up to the ferry,
Mrs. Dance. It'll be safer.

1084
01:17:46,204 --> 01:17:47,317
No, I wouldn't...

1085
01:17:47,389 --> 01:17:50,772
I wouldn't feel easy under
foot in another woman's house.

1086
01:17:54,111 --> 01:17:56,533
Well, what kind of dress
was Caroline wearing?

1087
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,785
Gingham.

1088
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,993
Blue and white checked.

1089
01:18:00,064 --> 01:18:01,722
Did she have a gun?

1090
01:18:03,297 --> 01:18:04,507
I...

1091
01:18:05,088 --> 01:18:06,682
I don't recollect.

1092
01:18:07,906 --> 01:18:11,484
There was firing all around
while the red beasters were here.

1093
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:13,690
My Ben was killed right off.

1094
01:18:15,266 --> 01:18:17,471
It was him
I was thinking about,

1095
01:18:18,435 --> 01:18:19,995
not anybody else.

1096
01:18:24,676 --> 01:18:27,547
Caroline was out
looking for that no horn cow.

1097
01:18:28,165 --> 01:18:31,035
She's a breechy creature,
always knocking down the fence

1098
01:18:31,109 --> 01:18:33,281
and some kind of grass up in
the canyon that she yearned for.

1099
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:35,293
Who's that? Sing out!

1100
01:18:35,943 --> 01:18:37,252
Hey!

1101
01:18:45,513 --> 01:18:47,236
I'm coming in.

1102
01:18:48,138 --> 01:18:49,797
Stay where you are!

1103
01:18:50,922 --> 01:18:52,351
I'm dead beat.

1104
01:18:56,875 --> 01:19:00,192
Do you want me hanging from
a tree skinned and dressed?

1105
01:19:00,331 --> 01:19:02,437
You got nothing
coming to you.

1106
01:19:02,732 --> 01:19:04,161
I'm coming in.

1107
01:19:31,699 --> 01:19:32,812
Logan!

1108
01:19:43,156 --> 01:19:44,171
Hey!

1109
01:19:44,469 --> 01:19:46,029
Come here, quick.

1110
01:19:49,238 --> 01:19:50,547
Caroline's.

1111
01:21:35,179 --> 01:21:36,390
Caroline.

1112
01:21:45,069 --> 01:21:46,280
Caroline.

1113
01:21:49,743 --> 01:21:51,304
How are they all?

1114
01:21:53,615 --> 01:21:55,503
Mrs. Dance is all right.

1115
01:21:56,529 --> 01:21:57,544
Ben?

1116
01:21:59,376 --> 01:22:01,067
He's dead, Caroline.

1117
01:22:01,489 --> 01:22:02,766
So is Asa.

1118
01:22:28,311 --> 01:22:29,521
Caroline.

1119
01:22:30,135 --> 01:22:34,031
I want all of you to come back to
Jacksonville. Put up at my place.

1120
01:22:34,296 --> 01:22:36,303
I wouldn't want to do that.

1121
01:22:36,728 --> 01:22:38,616
You'll be doing it soon.

1122
01:22:42,298 --> 01:22:44,599
I don't want to
leave here, Logan.

1123
01:22:45,338 --> 01:22:47,542
I can never be
a town woman again.

1124
01:22:47,610 --> 01:22:49,618
I could never be a woman
moving around.

1125
01:22:49,914 --> 01:22:52,468
I... I'd disappoint you.

1126
01:22:53,724 --> 01:22:56,659
It came to me last night.
We're not the same.

1127
01:22:57,533 --> 01:23:00,468
And then today, when you
found me, you and Vane,

1128
01:23:00,797 --> 01:23:02,107
I was sure.

1129
01:23:05,342 --> 01:23:08,310
I want to look out of the
window and see my man plowing.

1130
01:23:08,383 --> 01:23:11,417
And in the evening, see
him in the kitchen rocker.

1131
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:14,976
You're thinking of Vane.

1132
01:23:16,192 --> 01:23:19,160
I'm thinking I'm not
hurting you too much, Logan.

1133
01:23:19,841 --> 01:23:23,519
And as time went by, I'd
be hurting you, is that it?

1134
01:23:25,059 --> 01:23:26,335
That's it.

1135
01:23:59,274 --> 01:24:01,892
Caroline, crying
helps some people a lot.

1136
01:24:03,083 --> 01:24:05,123
Some people it doesn't help.

1137
01:24:21,549 --> 01:24:23,011
You folks all right?
Oh, yes.

1138
01:24:23,086 --> 01:24:24,134
But what about the Dances?

1139
01:24:24,207 --> 01:24:25,483
They were hit pretty bad.

1140
01:24:25,550 --> 01:24:27,820
Ben and little Asa were
killed. Oh, and Caroline?

1141
01:24:27,887 --> 01:24:28,967
Caroline's all right.

1142
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:31,560
Well, didn't you bring her back with
you? It's dangerous where she is.

1143
01:24:31,632 --> 01:24:33,323
She didn't come.
She doesn't like towns.

1144
01:24:33,392 --> 01:24:35,564
Well, she'd better get to like
them if she's marrying you.

1145
01:24:35,632 --> 01:24:38,121
She's not.
She's marrying Blazier.

1146
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:05,293
Well, what did I tell you?

1147
01:25:06,135 --> 01:25:07,083
About what?

1148
01:25:07,159 --> 01:25:09,200
About the trouble
that always comes.

1149
01:25:09,272 --> 01:25:12,851
And your Crescent pack string was
destroyed over in the Applegate.

1150
01:25:12,921 --> 01:25:15,158
The Scottsburg outfit's
gone, too.

1151
01:25:15,577 --> 01:25:17,137
Blazier got clear.

1152
01:25:17,209 --> 01:25:19,315
You know how you stand,
Logan?

1153
01:25:21,274 --> 01:25:22,681
You're broke.

1154
01:25:34,813 --> 01:25:36,952
This is what you lent Camrose.

1155
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:39,452
Where is he?

1156
01:25:41,919 --> 01:25:42,999
Indians get him?

1157
01:25:43,071 --> 01:25:45,210
No, one of the boys.

1158
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,443
Never mind which one.

1159
01:25:55,617 --> 01:25:57,211
There was a lot of good
in George.

1160
01:25:57,282 --> 01:25:59,584
Yeah, he sure
panned out no color.

1161
01:26:00,354 --> 01:26:03,999
It's a thin margin, Johnny,
between what could be and what is.

1162
01:26:04,099 --> 01:26:05,179
Yeah.

1163
01:26:05,251 --> 01:26:07,390
It was thin for you
last night.

1164
01:26:07,971 --> 01:26:09,979
We were a mind to hang you.

1165
01:26:14,374 --> 01:26:15,421
Lucy.

1166
01:26:16,518 --> 01:26:18,657
You see how thin
the margin is.

1167
01:26:21,543 --> 01:26:23,583
Did you know about this?
Yes.

1168
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:29,026
In some other kind of country,
he might have made the grade.

1169
01:26:34,344 --> 01:26:35,839
There's not much left,
is there?

1170
01:26:35,913 --> 01:26:36,960
Not much.

1171
01:26:37,033 --> 01:26:41,573
Well, Logan, now you haven't got any
store, but you've got lots of time.

1172
01:26:43,371 --> 01:26:45,892
I guess I'll have to make that
trip to San Francisco after all.

1173
01:26:45,964 --> 01:26:47,906
See if I can rustle up
some credit.

1174
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:49,574
Want some company?

1175
01:26:50,124 --> 01:26:52,329
If you can keep up
on that mule.

1176
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:54,348
I'll see you.

1177
01:26:55,725 --> 01:26:58,147
When are you leaving?
In the morning.

1178
01:26:59,855 --> 01:27:00,968
Logan,

1179
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:05,166
would you mind having
a woman on your hands?

1180
01:27:11,409 --> 01:27:13,898
<i>Oh, buttermilk sky</i>

1181
01:27:13,969 --> 01:27:16,785
<i>Can't you see
my little donkey and me?</i>

1182
01:27:16,850 --> 01:27:19,053
<i>We're as happy
as a Christmas tree</i>

1183
01:27:19,122 --> 01:27:21,326
<i>Heading for the one I love</i>

1184
01:27:22,131 --> 01:27:24,139
<i>I'm gonna pop her the question</i>

1185
01:27:24,211 --> 01:27:25,837
<i>That question</i>

1186
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:28,047
<i>Do you, darling?
Do you, do?</i>

1187
01:27:28,116 --> 01:27:31,150
<i>It'll be easy, so easy</i>

1188
01:27:31,221 --> 01:27:33,131
<i>If I can only bank on you</i>

1189
01:27:33,205 --> 01:27:35,345
<i>Oh, buttermilk sky</i>

1190
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:37,554
<i>I'm telling you why</i>

1191
01:27:37,622 --> 01:27:41,168
<i>Now you know,
keep it in mind tonight</i>

1192
01:27:41,335 --> 01:27:43,823
<i>Keep brushing those clouds
from sight</i>

1193
01:27:44,087 --> 01:27:46,357
<i>Oh, buttermilk sky</i>

1194
01:27:46,649 --> 01:27:49,431
<i>Don't you fail me
when I'm needing you most</i>

1195
01:27:49,497 --> 01:27:51,799
<i>Hang a moon
above her hitching post</i>

1196
01:27:51,865 --> 01:27:54,964
<i>Hitch me to the one I love</i>
