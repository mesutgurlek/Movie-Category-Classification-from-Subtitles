1
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,274
Very efficient stage line.

2
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,006
Right on time.

3
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,410
Take a look, Matt.

4
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,524
We're right on schedule.

5
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:16,078
It's a little crowded here.

6
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,519
- Hi, Marty. Got the manifest?
- Here, Ben.

7
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,427
It's about dinnertime, Laurie.

8
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,400
You go ahead, Dad.
I'll check this bill and be right along.

9
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,662
Fine, honey.

10
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,403
Cool them off
before you feed them, Randolph.

11
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,309
Nice little town, huh?

12
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:52,216
- Your passbook, Marshal?
- I've got it.

13
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:58,448
Never mind, Mrs. Cain.
You can bring it in next time.

14
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,084
Why, I have it. Here you are.

15
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,795
- There you are, Marshal.
- Thank you, Arthur.

16
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,977
Don't move, mister. And no noise.

17
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,147
All right, do as you're told and be quiet.
Come on.

18
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,451
Over there.

19
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,287
You heard him. Against the wall.

20
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,686
Hello, Ben.

21
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:39,163
Hello there, Marshal Cain.
How are you, young lady?

22
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,599
Young lady?
I don't believe you're well, Ben Cutler.

23
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:46,570
- Never felt better in my life, Mollie.
- Maybe just a little nervous.

24
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,164
Me? Look at that: Steady as a rock.

25
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,733
I want to see you do that
two weeks from tomorrow.

26
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,711
- I'll do it.
- No, you won't.

27
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,147
You'll probably keel over
in a dead faint at the altar.

28
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,650
All you big, strong men are alike.

29
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:06,091
Where are you and Ruth
going on your honeymoon? Lincoln?

30
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,387
Now, Mollie.

31
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,088
- You promise not to tell, Mollie?
- I won't.

32
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:14,394
- China.
- All right. I'll find out.

33
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:18,130
- She will, too, Ben. I guarantee it.
- Well, not from me she won't.

34
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:22,573
You'll be happy, Ben.
You both deserve happiness so much.

35
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,007
Thank you, Mollie.

36
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:25,971
I declare!

37
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:30,414
It's a good thing you're getting married.
Kissing women in the middle of the street.

38
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,543
- Right in front of their own husbands.
- Only you, Mollie.

39
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,554
You better keep your eye on her
for the next couple of weeks.

40
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,749
As long as I'm a bachelor, she's in danger.

41
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,620
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Ben.

42
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,694
Now get in the back and open the big box.

43
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:51,995
Matt.

44
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,182
I think you better open it.

45
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,071
- Good day. Something in a dress for you?
- Yes, ma'am. You.

46
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,742
- How are you, sweetheart?
- Fine. Oh, the biscuits.

47
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,612
- Is Laurie coming for lunch?
- She'll be along.

48
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:42,512
Look at that pie. Apple, isn't it?

49
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:51,055
Bean soup. Golden fried chicken.

50
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:55,591
I always thought when a man was in love
that he lost his appetite.

51
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,566
I'm disillusioned.
You're marrying me for my cooking.

52
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,574
Absolutely. What are you marrying me for?

53
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,703
- I honestly don't know.
- Here, I'll show you.

54
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,243
Mom, lunch ready? I'm starving.

55
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,447
Midge, take that noisy beast out of here!

56
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:19,552
And take your hat off! I'm yelling.

57
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,660
And wash up for lunch. And you, too, Ben.

58
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,735
Eddie?

59
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,110
- Eddie Campbell!
- Hi, Laurie.

60
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,704
Hi. When did you come back?

61
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,512
Just a little while ago.
Just passing through.

62
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,083
I was gonna drop by
and say hello before I left.

63
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,985
Well, I should think so.

64
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,318
Somebody out there talking to Eddie.

65
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:53,983
Frank, cover them.

66
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,929
You look well, Eddie.

67
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,998
Thanks. You do, too.

68
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,840
You promised to write me, you know.

69
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,969
I haven't had a letter
from you in over two years.

70
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,447
Well, you know how it is.

71
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,312
Damn Kid!

72
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,183
Look, I've got to meet this man here
in a few minutes...

73
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,657
and I'd rather be alone.

74
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,855
I have to go anyway. I'm late already.

75
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,934
Don't you forget your promise now.

76
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,327
Goodbye, Eddie.

77
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,839
That's enough. Let's get out!

78
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,709
Wait a minute! Let's not rush it.

79
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,351
You're trying to keep secrets from us?

80
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,615
You'll never make it out of Springdale.

81
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,818
- It's a holdup!
- Midge!

82
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,323
Midge! Come here.

83
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,464
Marshal! Where's the Marshal?

84
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,502
He just got one of them.

85
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:53,536
Come on!

86
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,878
Come on, let's go!

87
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,635
George, they got Frank.

88
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,400
Head up there to that draw.

89
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,923
Dad! Are you all right?

90
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,158
Yeah, I'm all right, honey. Midge.

91
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,760
Go get Dr. Paul and tell him to come over
to the jail right away.

92
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,099
Yes, sir.

93
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,244
Is it Hiram who's hurt?

94
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,410
It's Hiram, Mollie.

95
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,781
He won't hurt anymore.

96
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,167
I always knew this would be the way
it would happen someday...

97
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,093
and so did you.

98
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,706
Would you take him home, please?

99
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,459
Give her a little time alone.

100
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,771
Untie the Kid and put him in a cell.

101
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,171
One of them is still alive? Too bad.

102
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,472
Not for long.
He's the one that killed Marshal Cain.

103
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:13,906
The others got away.

104
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,174
At least they didn't get away
with all the money.

105
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,411
The one you nailed
was carrying about half of it.

106
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,917
- Get back, please.
- Eddie!

107
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,723
It's Eddie.

108
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,361
Ben, let's go get cleaned up.

109
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,445
Paul, he isn't going to...

110
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,038
Die? I don't think so.

111
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,980
How soon will you...

112
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,989
When he wakes up,
should he be given something to eat?

113
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,718
If he's hungry, yes.

114
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,029
I'll be in my office.

115
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:13,666
The bullet grazed his scalp.
I don't think it caused any concussion.

116
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,969
He should come out of it
in a couple of hours.

117
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,508
Thanks, Paul.

118
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,146
Come on, Laurie.

119
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,983
Avery, can you and Moore stay here
for a while?

120
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,853
Try to get somebody to relieve you.

121
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,987
- He won't be going anywhere.
- No. Not by himself he won't.

122
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:41,328
But his friends might take the notion
to come back and try to get him.

123
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,063
Anyway, I'd keep the doors bolted,
and don't let anybody in you don't know.

124
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,908
Don't worry.

125
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,206
How soon will he be well enough
to hang, Ben?

126
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,614
Yeah.

127
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:08,457
A judge and a jury
will decide his punishment, not you.

128
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,587
Why waste the time?
We all know what he did.

129
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,492
I don't figure justice is a waste of time...

130
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:18,297
and I think most of the folks around here
feel the same way.

131
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:26,141
- I'll go home and get supper started, Dad.
- I'll be along in a minute, honey.

132
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,179
She'll be all right, Ben.

133
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,946
I wish I could keep her from
getting hurt too much.

134
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,447
You ought to eat something.

135
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,519
I can't.

136
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,367
Listen to me, honey.
There's one thing you've got to face.

137
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:56,067
Eddie Campbell isn't the same youngster
you grew up with and liked so much.

138
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:59,941
He's a man now, a dangerous man.
He killed Hiram Cain.

139
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,980
- No, he didn't.
- Yes, he did.

140
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,947
You know what that means.

141
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,678
It means a trial, a sentence,
and an execution.

142
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,447
Don't talk like that, Dad.

143
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,683
Honey, don't torture yourself like this.

144
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,918
Don't try to believe he's innocent
when he's guilty.

145
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:18,053
Whatever they do to him,
I'll never believe him guilty.

146
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:20,961
He's bad, yes. But he didn't kill anyone.

147
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,332
- I know him.
- I know him, too, Laurie. I know that...

148
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,537
It's Paul.

149
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,273
- Hello, Ben.
- Have you had your supper?

150
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,076
I've eaten, thanks.

151
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,979
- Hi, Laurie.
- Hello.

152
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,682
It's a very nice night.
I thought you might like to go for a walk.

153
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,653
Come on. A walk will do you good.

154
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,521
You can do the dishes later. Come on.

155
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,097
Good evening, Laurie, Doc.
Is your dad at home?

156
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,571
There he is.

157
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,473
Ben, we'd like to talk to you.

158
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,908
Come in, boys.

159
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,205
- Sit down?
- No, thanks.

160
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,476
You know why we're here I'm sure.

161
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,713
This was Marshal Cain's badge.

162
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,812
We'd like you to wear it.

163
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,826
I haven't worn a badge since...

164
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:25,057
It was just after Laurie was born,
almost 20 years.

165
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,358
I wish you'd get somebody else, Harry.

166
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,901
We need you, Ben. The whole town does.

167
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,401
You've had the experience...

168
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:37,704
and you'll be obeyed.
You already proved that this afternoon.

169
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:41,268
It don't have to be permanent, Ben.
Just till after the trial.

170
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,716
Would you like to think it over
until tomorrow?

171
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,880
No, I guess not.
I couldn't think my way out of this anyway.

172
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,554
Thanks, Ben. Now where's your Bible?

173
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,101
Anybody remember the oath?

174
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,233
- Well, let's see...
- I do.

175
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,672
"I hereby swear to uphold
and enforce the laws of this community...

176
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:15,008
"of the United States of America,
so help me, God."

177
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,989
It's a very nice night.

178
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,358
What were you crying about before?

179
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,563
I'd rather not talk about it, Paul.

180
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:36,959
It'll only lead to an argument.
I don't want that.

181
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:40,199
Laurie, there's some things I have to say.

182
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:43,400
I can't keep them
bottled up inside me any longer.

183
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,140
I love you.

184
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,040
I don't know why I never said so before.

185
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,176
I just never got around to it, I guess.

186
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,084
But you've known it, haven't you?

187
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,585
I want you to marry me, Laurie.

188
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:05,461
- I don't know what to say, Paul.
- Just say you will, that's all.

189
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:10,295
I can't. Not now. Not yet.

190
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,739
You're not in love with Eddie Campbell.

191
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,675
- I don't know.
- You're sorry for him but you don't love him.

192
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,873
- You couldn't love a man like that.
- Maybe I can.

193
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:31,245
I'm sorry I had to be the one
to patch him up.

194
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,752
It's hard being the only doctor in town.

195
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,429
But the job has its compensations.

196
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:44,497
When they hang him, I'll be the one
to pronounce him officially dead.

197
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,138
You tell me you love me...

198
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:51,835
and then, in the same breath,
you tear me apart with those awful words.

199
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,571
You don't love me.

200
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,903
You couldn't love anybody.

201
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,344
There's too much hate in you!

202
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:19,193
We are gathered here
in the sight of our Lord...

203
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:23,672
to lay to rest
the body of our beloved friend...

204
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,441
Hiram Cain.

205
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:30,174
"Man is born of woman
and hath but a short time to live..."

206
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:33,843
It's the Kid, Ben. He tore off his bandages.
He's bleeding pretty bad.

207
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,855
"In the midst of life we are in death.

208
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,018
"Earth to earth...

209
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,189
"ashes to ashes...

210
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,355
"dust to dust."

211
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:53,594
- Hold his head.
- Why can't you just let me die?

212
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,638
'Cause you're gonna stand trial.

213
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,609
You'll stay alive
if I have to keep you tied up every minute.

214
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:03,307
No, you won't! I'm not gonna hang!
I'll find a way to die!

215
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,479
Eddie, please, don't!

216
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,851
Laurie, baby, I'm sorry.

217
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,490
If he's looking for a way to die...

218
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,727
he's gonna have to find
a better one than that.

219
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,396
His wound's not anywhere near that serious.

220
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,803
Furthermore, I think he knows it.

221
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:50,486
- Good evening, Mr. Avery.
- Evening, Laurie.

222
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,429
Wait a minute, Laurie.
I don't think you ought to be here.

223
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:56,399
- Is he conscious?
- Has been most of the day.

224
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,338
We tried to get him to eat something
a while ago...

225
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,507
but he wouldn't take it.

226
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,412
Hi, Laurie.

227
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,643
Open the cell, would you, please?

228
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:30,324
I brought you a clean shirt
and something to eat.

229
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:33,633
- I'm not hungry.
- Maybe this will change your mind.

230
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,605
It's beef broth I made.

231
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,367
- Father tell you to bring it?
- No, Eddie.

232
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,604
Help keep me alive so I can hang?

233
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,170
Eddie, please don't talk like that.

234
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:46,542
If you do, I'll have to go and I don't want to.

235
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:49,210
I don't want you to, either.

236
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,016
Will you eat my soup?

237
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,689
Please, Mr. Avery.

238
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,364
You'll be good, won't you, Eddie?

239
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:07,628
- Promise?
- Promise.

240
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:27,421
- Can you eat by yourself?
- I think so.

241
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:35,928
It's good. Wonderful.

242
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:41,936
- You're awfully good to me, Laurie.
- It's because I believe in you.

243
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,840
- I know you couldn't kill anyone.
- Yeah?

244
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,278
You're the only one who believes that.

245
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,272
It's true, though, isn't it?

246
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:55,376
Yes, it's true. I didn't shoot that marshal.
One of the others must have.

247
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:58,820
Your father knows I didn't do it.
He saw the killing.

248
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:03,026
It really doesn't make
any difference, though...

249
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,330
- because I don't have a chance.
- Yes, you do.

250
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:08,861
How do you figure that, Laurie?

251
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:12,665
There won't be one man on that jury
that wasn't a friend of Marshal Cain's.

252
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,602
But they're good people.

253
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:16,604
Honest people.

254
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:19,735
If you tell them the truth, they'll believe you.
I know they will.

255
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,403
Laurie, it is the truth.

256
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:25,313
I helped with the bank holdup
and I stood guard. But I didn't kill anybody.

257
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:26,850
I believe you.

258
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:32,083
It's funny that that's almost enough.

259
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:36,325
I mean, you believing me.

260
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,234
Will you come back soon, Laurie?

261
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:47,862
Yes, I will.

262
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,373
He doesn't have to be handcuffed anymore.

263
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,948
- Good night, Eddie.
- Good night, Laurie.

264
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,381
Sleep well.

265
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,268
Lock up after me.

266
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:23,865
I'm gonna go see Ben
about leaving the cuffs off the Kid.

267
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:48,192
Could you tell me where the jail is?

268
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,623
I understand you're holding
Edward Campbell. I'd like to see him.

269
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:23,031
Sorry, mister. Nobody gets in here
without the Marshal's permission.

270
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,126
And where would I find him?

271
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,202
There, he's coming now.

272
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:32,799
- Are you the marshal?
- That's right.

273
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:36,674
My name is Selby, William Selby.
I'm here to see Edward Campbell.

274
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,113
What for?

275
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:40,413
Apparently, you don't know who I am.

276
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:41,952
Apparently, I don't.

277
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,917
"William P. Selby. Attorney at law."

278
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:51,260
- What do you want to see Campbell about?
- His defense, of course.

279
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:53,354
Did the Governor appoint you
defense counsel?

280
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:56,127
- He did not.
- Then who retained you?

281
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:59,432
I don't think his identity
is any business of yours, Marshal.

282
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:02,405
If your private party
happens to be a fugitive from justice...

283
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:03,736
then it is my business.

284
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:06,641
I didn't come all the way from Lincoln
to argue with you.

285
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:10,238
Your prisoner is entitled by law
to consult with his counsel...

286
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:11,873
and you know it.

287
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,313
All right, Mr. Selby.

288
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:16,842
But I don't want you discussing this case
with any citizen of Springdale.

289
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,946
They're all prospective jurors.

290
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,118
Let him in, Avery.

291
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,723
Thank you very much.

292
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:30,929
Come in.

293
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:34,136
- Hi, Ruth.
- Hi, Ben. You're early.

294
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:36,940
- You going over to the jail again?
- Yes.

295
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:39,602
I've told you the county furnishes meals
for prisoners.

296
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,440
It's only a little cake and coffee.

297
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:45,381
You gotta see the food they send over
from the lunchroom. It's just terrible.

298
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:49,787
Maybe the cook over at the lunchroom
isn't sympathetic enough.

299
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:52,254
I'll have to go over and have a talk with him.

300
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:57,189
If I had any sense,
I wouldn't let her go over there to see him.

301
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:00,322
- That'd just make her wanna see him more.
- Yeah, I know.

302
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,890
- She thinks the boy is innocent.
- He's not innocent. He's guilty.

303
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,936
You're in a terrible mood, Ben.

304
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:09,269
I just ran into a character
by the name of William P. Selby.

305
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,106
He's an attorney at law. He came
all the way from Lincoln to defend the Kid.

306
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:14,736
There's nothing wrong with that.

307
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,145
Surely you can't object to it
if he has legal help?

308
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:20,878
I can if it's being paid for with money
stolen from the Springdale Bank.

309
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:24,353
- You have no proof of that.
- Where else would it come from?

310
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,384
Ben, you are so prejudiced
against this boy...

311
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:31,292
that your whole outlook
on the case is distorted.

312
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,531
Just what does that mean?

313
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,326
I think you're afraid
that this lawyer may convince the jury...

314
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:40,200
that he's not guilty.

315
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,832
That's strange talk coming from you.

316
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:46,843
A woman whose husband was killed
by the same kind of man...

317
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:49,141
- as Eddie Campbell.
- That's not true.

318
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:52,149
Eddie is just a boy.
Tom was killed by a hardened criminal.

319
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,242
You think this kid is any less hardened?

320
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,755
Since when is a young rattlesnake
any less poisonous than an old one?

321
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:01,485
I wish you hadn't accepted that badge.
It has changed you.

322
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,485
No, it hasn't, Ruth.

323
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:10,762
I shouldn't have talked to you like that.
There was no reason for it. I'm sorry.

324
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,703
Come on, then, and help me fix supper.

325
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,680
- What about his parents?
- We all knew his folks.

326
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:30,880
His father died
when he was just a youngster...

327
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,752
and his mother was pretty sickly.

328
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:35,691
So he left school
to start cow-punching to support his ma.

329
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,625
He couldn't have been over 14 then.

330
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:41,131
I see. How old was he
when his mother passed away?

331
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,429
It was two or three years after that.

332
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:47,335
He left Springdale then,
and we just don't know where he went.

333
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,597
Here. Drink up, gentlemen.

334
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:51,973
Hello, Ben.

335
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:56,009
Well, good evening, Marshal.
You care to have a drink?

336
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,377
No, thanks.

337
00:31:57,448 --> 00:32:00,008
Mr. Selby, I warned you
about discussing this case.

338
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:04,487
I have a right to ask questions
about my client's background.

339
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:06,847
I'm a stranger here, you know.

340
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,218
If any of you are picked for jury duty...

341
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,627
I'll see that
the State Attorney challenges you.

342
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,790
You've got no call to talk that way, Ben.

343
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:17,596
Are you saying we can be influenced by...

344
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,968
I'm not saying you can be.
I'm saying the attempt is being made.

345
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,473
Would you kindly explain that remark?

346
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:26,476
You're buying drinks
for the town's most respected citizens.

347
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:29,069
You're discussing
Campbell's unfortunate childhood.

348
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,308
If that's not an attempt to influence jurors...

349
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:32,781
I don't know what you'd call it.

350
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,681
You're way out of line, Ben.

351
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,377
The gentleman
has just expressed my sentiments.

352
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,355
I'll add this, Marshal.

353
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,789
I've run across a lot of men
who turned bloodthirsty...

354
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,591
as soon as they're given the badge,
but you're the worst I've ever seen.

355
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:49,326
You can't wait to hang this boy, can you?

356
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:55,062
Mr. Selby, you're a guest in this town.
I suggest you behave like one.

357
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,267
You're mistaken. I'm no guest, Marshal.

358
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:01,073
I'm here to do a job and I'm gonna do it.

359
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:05,548
I'm gonna free an innocent boy
that you want to hang for personal reasons.

360
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:08,414
I know all about Eddie Campbell
and your daughter.

361
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,113
I know that she...

362
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,926
You show great courage, Marshal...

363
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,224
with that badge and that gun.

364
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:27,469
What's got into Ben anyway?
I never saw him get this mad before.

365
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,234
Like the man said, maybe it's the badge.

366
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:34,771
No badge, no gun.

367
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,086
Dad!

368
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:00,361
Ben!

369
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,024
Come on, Uncle Ben!

370
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:38,768
Nice fight, Ben.

371
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:43,442
See that our guest
gets up to his hotel room.

372
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:48,081
Midge, go find Dr. Paul.

373
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,845
- Tell him to take a look at Mr. Selby.
- Yes, sir.

374
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,783
Give us a hand here, boys.

375
00:34:59,730 --> 00:34:59,797
Would you go upstairs?

376
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,128
Would you go upstairs?

377
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,691
In the medicine cabinet,
I think there's some liniment up there.

378
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,171
Ruth, I'm all right.

379
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,900
I might be a little tender in spots
for a week, but...

380
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:12,841
You know something?
I feel better than I did.

381
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,435
I think I got some of the edginess
knocked out of me.

382
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:18,209
Men are lucky.
Women can't do things like that.

383
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:21,046
- I just wish that...
- Now, don't go wishing you were a man.

384
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,848
I've got enough trouble.

385
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:24,949
Come in.

386
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,749
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hello, Ruth.

387
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:29,690
- Hi, Paul.
- Hi, Ben.

388
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,954
I came to see if you needed
a little patching up, too.

389
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:36,625
No, thanks. I'm all right. Nothing broken.

390
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,532
Just badly bent.

391
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,429
- What about the liniment?
- I won't need that. Thanks.

392
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,271
I just came from Selby's room.
Must have been quite a brawl.

393
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:46,469
I'm sorry I missed it.

394
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,603
- Did me a lot of good.
- Sure.

395
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,044
I found it.

396
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,044
- Hello, Laurie.
- Hello, Doctor.

397
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:58,914
- Look why don't you two stop...
- I think I'll go home now, Father.

398
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,416
Any time she calls me "Father"
that means trouble.

399
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,190
But don't worry, Paul.
It'll all turn out all right.

400
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:09,665
- Come on, I'll walk till the jail with you.
- All right.

401
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,130
Thanks, honey.

402
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:26,942
- See you later, Paul.
- Ben, a man waiting to see you inside.

403
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,043
- Joslin's his name.
- Tallant Joslin?

404
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,587
I think that's what he said.

405
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,681
He's State Attorney.
He must have come in for the trial.

406
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,650
- Hello, Tal.
- Hello, Ben.

407
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,490
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you.

408
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,895
- Have you been waiting long?
- Just a few minutes.

409
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:44,196
- So they sent you down to prosecute?
- That's right.

410
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:48,671
- What happened to your face, Ben?
- I ran into a door.

411
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,435
- Really? Anybody I know?
- I'm sure you must know him.

412
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,977
He's an attorney.
A character named William P. Selby.

413
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,205
No!

414
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:59,310
So he's here for the defense,
I might have known it.

415
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,783
I shouldn't have gotten into a fight with him.

416
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:05,788
- But he just rubbed me the wrong way.
- He has a special faculty for that.

417
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:09,017
Besides, I'm sure
the Kid's bank robber friends hired him.

418
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,288
Possibly, but not necessarily.

419
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:14,820
This is the first murder trial
we've had in this state in a long time.

420
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,960
It's going to attract a lot of attention,
and Selby's a politician.

421
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:21,300
I understand
that he's after the governor's job.

422
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,634
- Him?
- Yeah.

423
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:25,539
The Governor sent his regards, by the way.

424
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,102
He said he knew justice would be done
with you wearing the marshal's star.

425
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,711
- That was nice of him. How is John?
- He's fine.

426
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:36,681
All right. Now what about
this Edward Campbell?

427
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,184
He's guilty.

428
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,919
Who were the witnesses?

429
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,928
Besides me,
there were six others in the posse.

430
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:47,754
Did any of you see the actual shooting?

431
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:50,460
I saw it. I'm sure the others did, too.

432
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,599
Tal, you can do me a big favor.

433
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:57,004
Keep me off the stand if you can, will you?

434
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,338
- Why?
- It's my daughter Laurie.

435
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:02,612
She and this Kid,
sort of, were brought up together...

436
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,343
and she was fond of him at one time.
She thinks he's innocent.

437
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:10,183
- lf I had to testify and be the one who...
- Yes, I understand.

438
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:13,947
- I'll do what I can.
- Thanks. I'd appreciate it.

439
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:16,926
About these other witnesses,
what were their names?

440
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:19,792
There was William Avery, Ed Moore...

441
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,689
Stan Winslow and his brother Bert.

442
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:23,290
Just a moment. Back up a little.

443
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,392
- Where are you?
- Winslow.

444
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,233
- Stan Winslow, yeah, and his brother Bert.
- Bert Winslow.

445
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,573
Tracy, this is Alfred.

446
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:56,657
I'm sorry, folks! Standing room's all filled.
Close the door.

447
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,466
It's better than the state fair.

448
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,263
Bring him out.

449
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:12,139
Here they come!

450
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,349
How about a drink, Marshal?

451
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,623
Don't worry, Kid. You'll get off.

452
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:49,214
Sit here.

453
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,620
Not yet. Wait till the Judge comes in.

454
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:56,319
Hear ye, hear ye,
this court is now in session.

455
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,454
The Honorable John R. Frazier,
Judge, presiding.

456
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,896
Court is now convened.

457
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,467
Counselors, please take their seats.

458
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:17,179
<i>"The State of Nebraska v.</i>
<i>Edward Campbell. "</i>

459
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:21,979
Will the State's attorney
please begin the proceedings?

460
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:25,148
Your Honor, gentlemen of the jury...

461
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,723
"the State intends to prove the following:

462
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:33,191
"That on the afternoon of June 12, 1878...

463
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,494
"the defendant, Edward Campbell...

464
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:38,000
"did deliberately commit
the crime of murder...

465
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:41,128
"on the person of Marshal Hiram Cain...

466
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,600
"citizen and law officer
of the city of Springdale, Nebraska.

467
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:47,109
"The facts are simple and clear-cut.

468
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,612
"When the State is finished
presenting the evidence...

469
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,707
"I'm absolutely positive
that your verdict will be guilty as charged...

470
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,412
"and justice will be done."

471
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:59,384
Yes, sir. We was going pretty fast.

472
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,591
- At full gallop?
- Yes, sir.

473
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:06,786
Now, a few minutes ago, you testified
under the questionings of Mr. Joslin here...

474
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:11,591
that you thought you saw Edward Campbell
kill Marshal Cain.

475
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:16,038
You also testified
that you were the last member of the posse.

476
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,065
Now with the confusion of the horses...

477
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,737
and the dust
between you and the defendant...

478
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:24,679
and the dead Marshal at your feet...

479
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:29,446
Marshal Cutler dismounted and
the horses of the posse rushing past him...

480
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,014
isn't it possible that at a hundred yards,
in the confusion of the dust...

481
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,817
you could have been wrong?

482
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:42,122
Yes, I guess so.

483
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,630
Don't guess.

484
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,236
Tell the jury what you swore to tell them.

485
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:50,330
The truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

486
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:54,935
Did you see with your own eyes
the defendant commit murder?

487
00:41:56,814 --> 00:42:00,409
Well, I saw what I thought
could maybe be him.

488
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,714
Yes or no, Mr. Moore. No maybes.

489
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:06,352
This is a murder trial.

490
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:12,117
Well...

491
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,189
No.

492
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,230
Order.

493
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,110
The State calls William Avery.

494
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,640
William Avery to the stand.

495
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:41,390
Swear to tell the truth, the whole truth...

496
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,925
- nothing but the truth?
- Yes, sir.

497
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:44,551
- State your name.
- William Avery.

498
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:46,152
Take the stand.

499
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:48,859
Mr. Avery, it's been established...

500
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:52,266
that during the gunfight
that resulted in the death of Marshal Cain...

501
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,930
only one of the outlaws was firing.
Is that correct?

502
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:56,097
Yes, sir.

503
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:59,506
- Did you see the man who did the shooting?
- Yes, sir.

504
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,011
- Who was it?
- It was the defendant.

505
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,075
Your witness, sir.

506
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:12,714
Mr. Avery, you've been in the court...

507
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:16,487
while the previous five witnesses
were testifying, haven't you?

508
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:18,489
Yes, sir.

509
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:20,596
I know that you have a good memory...

510
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:24,293
but with your permission,
I would like to refresh it a bit.

511
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:27,796
So far, none of the five men
who accompanied you in the posse...

512
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:32,001
have been able to positively identify
which of the three outlaws...

513
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:34,843
actually did the shooting of Marshal Cain.

514
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:37,380
Now do you recall that testimony?

515
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:39,740
- Yes.
- Good.

516
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:44,953
Now I want you to tell the court
and the jury...

517
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:50,559
if you think that your vision is any better
than that of the other five witnesses.

518
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,729
No better, but just as good.

519
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:56,327
All right.

520
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:59,131
Now tell the jury...

521
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:03,366
which one of the outlaws
killed Marshal Cain.

522
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:07,902
Like the others said, from where I was...

523
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:11,280
it looked like it was the Kid, the defendant.

524
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:12,979
It looked?

525
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,717
Now these 12 men
are not interested in guesses.

526
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:17,378
They want facts.

527
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:19,355
Now, once again...

528
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:23,325
and this time, I want you to be
absolutely sure of your answer.

529
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:26,659
A man's life depends
upon your testimony, Mr. Avery.

530
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,429
Which one of the outlaws was it?

531
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:39,436
If you put it that way,
I just can't say for sure.

532
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:43,508
- No more questions.
- You may step down.

533
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:47,748
They've got no case, son.

534
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:50,612
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to put you
on the stand.

535
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:56,316
The State calls Marshal Ben Cutler.

536
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:58,520
Marshal Cutler to the stand.

537
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:04,034
Swear to tell the truth, the whole truth...

538
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:05,534
- nothing but the truth?
- I do.

539
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:06,660
- Your name?
- Ben Cutler.

540
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:08,261
Take the stand.

541
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:17,413
Would you please give us
your version of the shooting?

542
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:22,045
Hiram Cain was the first man
to follow the bank robbers out of town.

543
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:24,713
I was next, maybe 20 yards behind him.

544
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:27,185
The rest of the posse followed.

545
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:30,353
Now the outlaws made a stand
at the top of the hill.

546
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:32,486
Well, you've heard all that.

547
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:36,055
The posse was swinging up the draw
when Hiram Cain was killed.

548
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:37,930
Now, maybe, for certain reasons...

549
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:41,266
the other men in the posse
can't identify the killer.

550
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:42,498
I can.

551
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,134
You can? Is he here in this courtroom?

552
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,268
Yes, he is.

553
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:51,375
- The defendant, Edward Campbell.
- Your witness, sir.

554
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:00,489
Marshal Cutler, isn't it true...

555
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:04,186
that your daughter and Eddie Campbell
were childhood sweethearts?

556
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,250
Objection.

557
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:08,821
Your Honor, the Marshal's personal life
has nothing to do with this case.

558
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:10,025
Objection sustained.

559
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,568
Stick to the facts, Mr. Selby.
You know better.

560
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:14,501
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

561
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:20,976
Marshal, were you on foot or mounted
when the shooting occurred?

562
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:24,079
- I was on foot.
- Really? How did that occur?

563
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:26,013
My horse was shot from under me.

564
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:28,907
- Then you must have fallen.
- I fell.

565
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,551
- I trust you weren't hurt.
- I wasn't hurt.

566
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:36,849
Gentlemen, most of us have fallen...

567
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:39,919
or been thrown from a horse
sometime during our lives.

568
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:41,521
It shakes a man up.

569
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:45,534
With most men, it takes a while
even to know what day it is.

570
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:50,164
But not the Marshal.
He's a pretty rugged man.

571
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:54,774
Marshal, how close were you
to the outlaws...

572
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:57,245
when you finally landed in the dirt?

573
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,908
- I'd say about 50 yards.
- About?

574
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,678
That's what I said. About.

575
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:03,250
Fifty yards.

576
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:07,214
Shaken up from having been thrown
from a horse at full gallop...

577
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:10,192
with the posse horses
thundering all around...

578
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,562
and you can still positively identify...

579
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:16,121
the outlaw who shot Marshal Cain?

580
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:19,095
- I can.
- How?

581
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:22,400
Because only one of them was shooting
when Hiram Cain was hit.

582
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:25,771
I saw his face very plainly.
It was Edward Campbell.

583
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,335
I shot him, knocked him off his horse.

584
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:31,210
When I got up to where he was lying,
I turned him over.

585
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:33,146
He was lying face down.

586
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,509
It was still Edward Campbell.

587
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:47,189
Jury's coming in.

588
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:01,009
Everybody, please rise.

589
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:09,312
Be seated, please.

590
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:13,487
Gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

591
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:18,384
- We have, Your Honor.
- What is your verdict?

592
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:22,891
We find him guilty as charged.

593
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:27,326
The defendant will please rise.

594
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:38,046
Have you anything to say
before this court pronounces sentence?

595
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,272
Your Honor...

596
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:44,445
I've known Marshal Cutler
almost all my life...

597
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:48,089
and I know he's honest.

598
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,293
He thinks he saw me
shoot down Marshal Cain...

599
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:54,125
so he had to say so.

600
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:58,459
I don't blame him for that.

601
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:01,034
Not a bit.

602
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:05,198
But I didn't do it.

603
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:10,844
I swear I didn't.

604
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:17,079
I admit I did wrong.

605
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:20,345
I helped Frank to...

606
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:25,793
I helped rob the bank,
and I ought to be punished for that...

607
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:28,998
but I couldn't kill anybody.

608
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:32,891
I just couldn't.

609
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,337
I had all the chance in the world...

610
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:41,002
if I could have killed somebody,
to kill Marshal Cutler...

611
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:42,409
but I didn't.

612
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:45,710
I deliberately shot at his horse instead.

613
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:49,581
That's all.
I mean, that's when I quit shooting.

614
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,717
One of the others
must have killed Marshal Cain.

615
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:57,718
I swore...

616
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:01,726
that I'd never beg for anything.

617
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:06,460
But I'm begging now...

618
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:10,062
for my life...

619
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:13,940
and for a second chance...

620
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:21,045
because I never really had a first one.

621
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:31,159
Edward Campbell...

622
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:36,398
it is the sentence of this court
that on the morning of June 20...

623
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:41,497
in the year of 1878,
between the hours of 7:00 and 10:00 a. m...

624
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:44,430
you shall be hanged by the neck until dead.

625
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:50,540
Marshal.

626
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:14,329
Court stands adjourned.

627
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,152
- Everything all right in there, Ed?
- Yes, fine.

628
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:42,562
That lawyer fellow was here looking for you.
Said he'd wait in the saloon.

629
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:43,758
Thanks.

630
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:02,712
Hello, Tal.

631
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:05,711
Greetings, Ben.

632
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,356
What are you doing in here?

633
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:10,893
Two things, in the order of their importance.

634
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,690
One: Getting drunk.

635
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,261
Two: Waiting to talk to you.

636
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,825
I thought you were going out
on the afternoon stage.

637
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:23,168
I told you I wanted to see you.
Where you been?

638
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:26,101
Out in God's clean, clear country...

639
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:29,111
where a man can be alone
with his tortured soul?

640
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:33,038
Wish I enjoyed riding a horse.

641
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:35,715
Never had much use for it.

642
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:40,955
Two inches per hour.

643
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:44,549
When I'm imbibing with
true intoxication in mind, that's my rate.

644
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:46,653
You can set your watch by it.

645
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,221
That's my hourglass. Go on, help yourself.

646
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:52,063
Bartender, have another glass?

647
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,704
You can save yourself time
by drinking faster, Tal.

648
00:52:57,974 --> 00:52:59,874
Not and keep my dignity, Ben.

649
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:05,278
I need that. I need it worse
every time I send somebody to the gallows.

650
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:14,018
Tal, here's to you.

651
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:21,262
I came to talk to you about the execution.

652
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:26,366
- We don't have to talk about that, do we?
- But we do.

653
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,634
There hasn't been a hanging in Nebraska
in a long time.

654
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:32,197
There have been
some new ordinances passed.

655
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:35,839
Like what?

656
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:39,109
Like you can't take a man out to a tall tree...

657
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,474
stand him on a barrel anymore.

658
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:43,183
I know that.

659
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:46,822
- A gallows has to be built.
- That's right.

660
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:48,819
And here...

661
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:52,727
Here are the measurements.

662
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:57,531
Also a tight, high board fence.

663
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:02,404
- A fence?
- To ensure privacy.

664
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,572
A public execution is held to constitute...

665
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:08,611
a cruel and unusual punishment.

666
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:12,611
Three official witnesses...

667
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,476
you, the doctor, and one other.

668
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:22,914
Let's talk about something else.
How's the family?

669
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:26,418
They're fine. Boy's in law school.

670
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,557
Girl's married to a young rancher.

671
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,163
She's going to make me
a grandfather any day.

672
00:54:33,803 --> 00:54:35,236
That's fine.

673
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:37,797
Yeah.

674
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,168
I'm a very happy man.

675
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:23,411
Hello, Ruth.

676
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:28,219
I've been waiting for you.

677
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:32,094
- Weren't you coming over?
- Yes, I was, Ruth.

678
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:35,959
I'm sorry, I just didn't think
I'd be very good company tonight.

679
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:37,829
You're not going to do it.

680
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:39,460
Hang him?

681
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,568
- Somebody has to.
- But not you.

682
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:43,663
Who then?

683
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,334
Anybody. It doesn't matter, Ben,
but not you.

684
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:49,207
Look, if somebody came along
and offered to do it for me...

685
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:52,112
I'd give him a month's salary, gladly.
Two months'.

686
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:54,009
Nobody's going to.

687
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:56,712
But, Ben, think of Laurie.

688
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:59,214
I do think of her, every minute.

689
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:04,288
You could take that badge off
and throw it in the dirt...

690
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,228
and walk away from it,
and no one would blame you.

691
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:09,095
No one but me.

692
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:12,666
Is your pride worth more to you
than your daughter?

693
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:15,334
It's not just pride, Ruth.

694
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:18,574
It's a lot of other things all mixed together.

695
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,571
It's the oath I took on the Bible...

696
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:24,704
the land I live in and love...

697
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:29,811
but mostly it's a matter
of justice and the law.

698
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:33,985
I happen to believe in them.

699
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:36,389
Enough to make you an executioner?

700
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:41,187
Ruth, try to understand. I've got to do it.

701
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:42,557
You want to do it!

702
00:56:42,632 --> 00:56:45,726
You've wanted that boy's life
ever since you brought him in here!

703
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:47,736
Don't talk like an idiot!

704
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:50,272
Ben, I just thought of something very funny.

705
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,967
The day of the hanging, June 20th...

706
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:54,134
that's the day
we were supposed to get married.

707
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:56,337
- Isn't that a big joke?
- Ruth, listen to me.

708
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:59,610
What were you planning to do?
Walk from the gallows to the church...

709
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:01,582
and have me there waiting for you?

710
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:13,359
I'm home, Laurie.

711
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,116
You going someplace, honey?

712
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:43,751
To Ruth's. I can't live in this house
with you anymore.

713
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:45,158
- Listen to me...
- Don't touch me.

714
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:47,662
You're my daughter.
You're going to live in my home.

715
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,129
You can't keep me here.

716
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,861
Not unless you handcuff me,
and lock me up like Eddie.

717
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:54,062
I suppose you could do that
if you wanted to.

718
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,161
Laurie, listen to me.

719
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:57,672
It's only on your account
that Eddie's gonna die.

720
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,298
Couldn't you be wrong?

721
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:02,003
The whole town thinks so,
and I think so, too!

722
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:25,725
- Good afternoon, Mollie.
- Good afternoon, Ben.

723
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:30,702
How's my girl been?

724
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:32,832
The same, Ben, the same.

725
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:36,036
- But pull up a chair.
- No, I'll sit right here, Mollie.

726
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:39,043
Hiram and I used to sit here together.

727
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:40,880
Very pleasant.

728
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:43,614
I expected you, Ben.

729
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:47,690
Mollie, I came to borrow
some of your strength.

730
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:50,021
Nonsense. You don't need it.

731
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:52,823
You're one of the strongest men
I've ever known.

732
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:54,591
No, not inside, Mollie.

733
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:57,461
I've got to hang that boy.

734
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:00,195
Yes.

735
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:03,202
Hiram had to do such things.

736
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:06,107
I know the kind of man he was.

737
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:09,137
He must have needed your help, too.

738
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:14,644
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you cry.
Forgive me.

739
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:18,446
Nonsense.

740
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:21,152
There's nothing to forgive.

741
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:24,655
A woman cries, she was meant to.

742
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:29,087
A man can get drunk and get into fights...

743
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:32,128
but a woman can cry. It's good.

744
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,761
I cry for my man who's gone...

745
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,671
and I cry for that boy...

746
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:43,271
with the terrible thing inside him
that made him kill.

747
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:47,672
But mostly, I cry for you, Ben...

748
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,980
because you can't do it yourself.

749
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:56,284
There, you see, I feel better.

750
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:00,853
You've made me feel better, too, Mollie.

751
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:04,024
Not better, but stronger,
like I knew you would.

752
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:07,934
I don't know why exactly, but you have.

753
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,232
Hiram used to say that.

754
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:13,765
You're a wise woman, Mollie.

755
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:16,075
Just an old one.

756
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,277
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

757
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,975
By the way,
I deposited $3,000 in your bank account.

758
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:24,278
You what?

759
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:27,380
The reward for Matt Fletcher.
The check came in the mail today.

760
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,982
- Now, Ben, that's yours.
- Don't argue with me, Mollie.

761
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:32,527
You know I'm too pigheaded for you to win.

762
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:34,529
Softheaded, you mean.

763
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:38,491
- That sounds more like my girl. Goodbye.
- Bye, Ben.

764
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,680
All right, hand me up a piece of board there.

765
01:00:57,754 --> 01:01:00,416
Those two men sure know
what they're doing, all right.

766
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,288
Yeah, there's a pair of ghouls
if I ever saw them.

767
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:07,224
- Where did Ben Cutler dig them up?
- From state prison.

768
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:10,161
He couldn't get anybody
around here to build a gallows...

769
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:12,428
so he had to import some experts.

770
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:14,603
It ain't right letting the Kid watch.

771
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,571
Ben ought to cover that window
or something.

772
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:18,300
No, not Ben.

773
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:20,968
Personally, I think
he's enjoying this whole thing.

774
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:23,239
- Hello, Ben.
- Morning.

775
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:25,745
- Mr. McKinnon!
- Howdy, Marshal.

776
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:29,080
- How about the fence?
- In good time, Marshal.

777
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:31,086
I told you I wanted the fence built first.

778
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:34,146
We might as well finish the gallows,
since we got this far.

779
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:36,214
Start on the fence right now!

780
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,801
Take a good look at his left-front shoe.

781
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:48,667
Hello, Paul.

782
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:53,274
- Takes a lot of work to hang a man.
- Yeah.

783
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:56,939
They're making a sideshow out of it.

784
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:00,143
Looks like it's fixing to rain.

785
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:03,549
No, not for a week, maybe 10 days.

786
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:06,212
Friday will be a good day for the hanging.

787
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:07,517
I'm not so sure.

788
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:09,990
Do you see that line of low clouds yonder?

789
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,892
You'll have to move some of those wagons
off the main street.

790
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:14,054
You're blocking the way.

791
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:17,095
- Sure thing, Marshal.
- Glad to oblige, Marshal.

792
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:19,191
If you've all come here to see the hanging...

793
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:20,735
you're going to be disappointed.

794
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:23,601
There's gonna be a high fence
around the gallows.

795
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,339
What do you know about that?

796
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:28,400
And I drove nearly 100 miles to see it, too.

797
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,055
Hello, Eddie.

798
01:03:23,933 --> 01:03:26,265
Eddie, I wish I could help you.

799
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:50,919
I've a lot of reasons why I don't wanna die...

800
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:54,025
and you're the main reason.

801
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:59,665
- I love you, Laurie. I always have.
- Eddie!

802
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:02,828
Baby.

803
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:09,275
I want you to do something for me.

804
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:11,870
- Anything!
- All right, then.

805
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:15,849
I want you to come back here tomorrow...

806
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:18,383
and I want you to bring me a gun.

807
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:21,389
- Will you do that for me, please?
- Eddie, no.

808
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,661
Please, will you do that for me?

809
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:31,461
All right.

810
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:49,845
I wouldn't trade places with him
for a million dollars.

811
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,113
Me, neither.

812
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:54,247
It'd be bad enough to have to hang a man
who's guilty, but...

813
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:55,984
You don't think the Kid did it?

814
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:59,152
I was in that posse, remember?
I couldn't tell who did it.

815
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:02,220
Reasonable doubt,
that's what they call it. Reasonable doubt.

816
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:04,528
If there's that, a man shouldn't be hung.

817
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,001
I'll tell you,
I've done a lot of mean things in my time...

818
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,537
all of us have...

819
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:13,502
but I never swore on a Bible
I was telling the truth when I wasn't.

820
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:16,535
You saying Ben Cutler was lying?

821
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:21,179
I'm saying I was in that posse
and I couldn't tell.

822
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:24,950
Of course, if I had a daughter
who was sweet on a convict...

823
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:27,381
maybe my eyesight would be better.

824
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,822
- He's got a point.
- Yeah, that's right.

825
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,291
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi.

826
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:42,728
Boy, oh, boy,
I've been around a pretty long time...

827
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:45,303
met a lot of people, all kinds...

828
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:48,467
but I never made such a mistake
about a man before.

829
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:50,512
You think Campbell's innocent, too?

830
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:53,104
- I'm sure of it.
- I don't know.

831
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:55,746
I don't know if he's guilty, either...

832
01:05:55,851 --> 01:05:57,751
and I don't think Ben knows.

833
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,752
Listen, we're the County Commissioners.

834
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:03,257
We appointed him marshal.
We can fire him, too.

835
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:05,055
No, that wouldn't help.

836
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:08,190
First of all, we couldn't find anybody else
right away.

837
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:09,595
Second, even if we could...

838
01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:11,633
the hanging would
have to take place anyway.

839
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:13,566
The Kid was sentenced to death, remember?

840
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,228
Yeah, on Ben Cutler's testimony.

841
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:18,569
Tell you what we could do.
We could start up a petition for clemency.

842
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,109
Practically the whole town would sign it.

843
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:25,304
- You think that would do any good?
- Couldn't hurt.

844
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:53,531
Hi, Uncle Ben.

845
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:55,577
Hello, Midge.

846
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:57,870
Little late for you to be out, isn't it?

847
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:00,245
I've been wanting to talk to you.

848
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:02,950
I saw you come in here.

849
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:06,949
Let's go out and talk in the corral.

850
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:11,985
- How has Alfred been, Midge?
- All right.

851
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:15,057
Come on, sit up here.

852
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:19,361
How's your mother and Laurie?

853
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:20,958
Fine, I guess.

854
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:23,369
Uncle Ben, you and Mom...

855
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:26,464
you're not gonna get married now, are you?

856
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:29,171
No, it doesn't look that way, Midge.

857
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:31,605
I wanted you to be my dad.

858
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:35,082
I wanted that more than anything
in the whole world.

859
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:36,516
Thanks, Midge.

860
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:40,483
But I'll always think of you
as my boy. I promise you that.

861
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:43,423
When I grow up, I'm gonna make you
proud of me, Uncle Ben.

862
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:45,517
Just as proud as if I were your very own.

863
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:47,994
- I'm sure you will, Midge.
- I'm gonna be like you.

864
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:50,658
Just like you. I'm gonna be a lawman.

865
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:54,031
No, Midge, I wouldn't want you to do that.

866
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:56,731
There are a lot of other things you could be.

867
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,571
You've seen what can happen
to a man with a badge.

868
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:01,075
I wouldn't be afraid.

869
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:03,771
No, I know you wouldn't be afraid, Midge.

870
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:07,247
But there are a lot of things worse than fear.
Much worse.

871
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:13,582
I know what you mean, but I'd do
what I had to do just like you...

872
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:16,316
even if everybody was against me, too.

873
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:20,291
Midge, you've got a few years
to think about it.

874
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:21,920
Maybe you'll change your mind.

875
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:25,057
You better run along home.
Your mom will be wondering about you.

876
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:26,897
Thanks for coming to see me.

877
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:28,903
Good night, Uncle Ben.

878
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:30,800
Good night, Midge.

879
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:52,126
- Who is it?
- Ben Cutler.

880
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:57,392
Hello, boys.

881
01:08:57,466 --> 01:09:00,833
Why don't you go get your dinner?
I'll take over for a while.

882
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,370
- Seen the paper, Ben?
- Thanks.

883
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:10,074
It's your girl.

884
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:31,493
Wait a minute, Avery.

885
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:35,935
Aren't you gonna inspect that basket
before you let it go in the cell?

886
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,267
Ben, it's your own daughter...

887
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:41,605
Doesn't make any difference. I want
everything checked before it goes in there.

888
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:52,945
Okay.

889
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:54,814
Ben!

890
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:10,696
Who did you want to see dead?

891
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:13,674
Mr. Avery? Mr. Moore? Me?

892
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:15,740
He wouldn't have killed anyone.

893
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:18,678
- You're sure of that?
- Yes, he's not like you!

894
01:10:19,114 --> 01:10:21,048
He couldn't take a human life.

895
01:10:25,854 --> 01:10:29,517
She's not to be allowed to come in here
anymore. Do you understand?

896
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:49,170
This gun's not loaded.

897
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,547
Sit down, Ben, please.

898
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:34,647
Well. How are you, Ruth?

899
01:11:35,424 --> 01:11:36,516
Fine.

900
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:38,326
And how's Laurie?

901
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:41,325
She's feeling sorry for herself...

902
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:44,159
but she'll get over it.

903
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:48,629
A good spanking is what she deserves.

904
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:51,133
Don't look so surprised.

905
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:54,804
I'm not always as stupid
as I was the other night.

906
01:11:55,678 --> 01:11:58,875
I didn't mean what I said. Not any of it.

907
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:04,651
Except the part about wanting you to resign.

908
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:05,982
I can't, Ruth.

909
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:09,351
- I know, Ben.
- And you don't care?

910
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:11,524
Of course I care.

911
01:12:13,896 --> 01:12:15,989
But I still love you.

912
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:19,298
And that's the only thing that matters.

913
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:28,109
Got a petition for you here, Marshal.

914
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:31,442
Two hundred and twelve signatures.
Almost every voter in Springdale...

915
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:34,380
wants Campbell's sentence
commuted to imprisonment.

916
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:39,342
If you expect me to make it unanimous,
you're talking to the wrong man.

917
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:40,615
We don't need your signature.

918
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:42,884
We want you to take it
to the Governor at Lincoln.

919
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:44,016
Why me?

920
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:46,186
Because you're the only one
who knows him well.

921
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:48,786
Somebody else might not get in
before it's too late.

922
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:51,796
If he turns it down...

923
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:55,098
you can still get back
in plenty of time for your hanging.

924
01:12:57,272 --> 01:12:59,740
It's wrong. The whole thing's just wrong.

925
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:05,571
I've got a long ride ahead of me.
I better get started.

926
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:29,329
- What time is it?
- Relax, Kid.

927
01:13:30,105 --> 01:13:32,266
Ben will be back in plenty of time.

928
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:40,340
Here.

929
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:42,076
No, thanks.

930
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:46,577
It's only about 10:00.

931
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:49,123
More than likely,
Ben's on his way back right now.

932
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:51,250
You think the Governor
will stop the hanging?

933
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:54,489
No doubt about it.
That petition represents a lot of votes...

934
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:56,497
including Moore's and mine.

935
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:47,446
And I tell you one thing...

936
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:50,314
he ain't gonna be forgotten by this town.

937
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:52,410
He's a good governor.

938
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,888
You gotta admit that, a good governor.

939
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,766
- Good evening, Doc.
- Hello, Doc.

940
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:11,736
- You're drunk, Avery.
- Why don't you tell Ben about it?

941
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:13,701
Maybe he'll fire us.

942
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:18,907
- Here, Doc, have a drink.
- No, thanks.

943
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:24,819
Look, Doc, we know how you feel.

944
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,948
It's too bad about you and Ben's daughter.

945
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:30,550
Those things happen sometimes.

946
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:32,856
You just gotta make the best of them.

947
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:34,323
Sure.

948
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:38,326
Listen.

949
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:43,804
- There's somebody in the corral.
- No, the horses are just restless.

950
01:15:44,606 --> 01:15:47,803
I'm going out to look. Lock up behind me.

951
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:38,377
Over against the wall.

952
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:43,251
You, turn around.

953
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:52,025
Hello, Kid.

954
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,762
George, I was wondering
when you were coming.

955
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:59,599
It's like shooting fish in a barrel, huh, Kid?

956
01:18:07,449 --> 01:18:09,713
There's a half a dozen of them out front.

957
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:12,083
- Is there another way out of here?
- No.

958
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:16,088
- Did he sign a commutation?
- Yes, he signed it.

959
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:20,889
Here it is.

960
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:24,355
And here's something else you can have.

961
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:29,166
There will be a state official here tomorrow
to take the Kid over to the prison at Lincoln.

962
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:36,106
Well, this is what we wanted.

963
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,849
The lawman's gone.
The rest of them are still out there.

964
01:18:41,917 --> 01:18:44,477
- Are they coming in?
- I don't know.

965
01:18:53,328 --> 01:18:55,888
- Ben, is that you?
- Yeah, it's me, Ruth.

966
01:18:57,432 --> 01:19:00,128
Thank goodness you're back.

967
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:02,667
Campbell isn't going to hang.

968
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:11,236
- I'm so happy for your sake.
- I am, too.

969
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:14,774
I don't think it's right, but it's a relief.

970
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:18,914
Well, it looks all right.

971
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:25,191
- What is it?
- It's a girl headed right this way.

972
01:19:25,794 --> 01:19:28,058
Wait till she knocks, then let her in.

973
01:19:28,864 --> 01:19:30,855
Let me in! It's Laurie Cutler!

974
01:19:36,338 --> 01:19:39,239
- Eddie, what are you...
- Shut up. See how it is.

975
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:44,269
It's all clear. Let's go.

976
01:19:44,346 --> 01:19:47,144
Eddie, they're not gonna hang you.
The Governor stopped it.

977
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:50,241
You don't say. Keep your mouth shut,
and you won't get hurt.

978
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:53,719
Eddie, please! You can't. Not after what...

979
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:55,646
Eddie, no!

980
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,589
Let's get out of here, Kid!

981
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:06,393
Come on.

982
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:31,487
What happened here?

983
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:33,989
- The Kid.
- Are you all right?

984
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:36,758
It's just a bump on the head.
Go get them, Ben.

985
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:09,193
Ruth, are you crazy? Get out of here!
Randolph, get her out.

986
01:22:49,431 --> 01:22:50,762
Dad, look out!

987
01:24:01,569 --> 01:24:03,002
On the scaffold.

988
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:25,055
Thanks, Paul. How bad you hit?

989
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:28,788
- I'll be all right.
- Come on, let's get you out of here.

990
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:35,366
Take it easy.

991
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:41,304
I told you it was hard
being the only doctor in town.

992
01:24:41,376 --> 01:24:43,401
He's gonna be all right, Laurie.

993
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:47,506
Take him over to Doc Simmons in Sycamore.

994
01:24:55,657 --> 01:24:58,285
Put it back on. Please.

995
01:24:59,627 --> 01:25:02,460
Who's gonna look after
us fools if you don't, Ben?
