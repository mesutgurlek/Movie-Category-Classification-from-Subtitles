1
00:01:48,293 --> 00:01:50,817
Uncover. Uncover.

2
00:01:51,895 --> 00:01:53,327
Uncover.

3
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:56,724
Uncover.

4
00:02:00,267 --> 00:02:03,429
-Captain Swanson of His Majesty's forces.
-Lieutenant Fouchier.

5
00:02:05,538 --> 00:02:08,370
Fifteen English prisoners
for 15 French prisoners.

6
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:11,408
Sergeant, deliver the prisoners
to Lieutenant Fouchier.

7
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:13,340
Yes, sir. This way, sir.

8
00:02:13,877 --> 00:02:17,403
One of these days, l'm gonna push the
open end of a musket down your throat.

9
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,208
Step back into line there.

10
00:02:20,148 --> 00:02:21,877
My apologies, Lieutenant.

11
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,753
lt is customary for His Majesty's soldiers,

12
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:32,017
if l may call you that
without maligning my sense of proportion,

13
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,580
to observe the rules of civilized warfare.

14
00:02:34,692 --> 00:02:36,250
-Yes, sir.
-Tripe.

15
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,651
-Who said that?
-l did.

16
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:45,659
Did you ever see a white man teach
an lndian to walk up under a flag of truce

17
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:48,758
and blast a soldier
from a gun hidden under a blanket?

18
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,160
-What's your name?
-His name is James Smith.

19
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:55,005
What do you mean by talking for him?

20
00:02:55,073 --> 00:02:57,233
Professor sometimes talks for me.

21
00:02:57,941 --> 00:03:00,102
Corporal, hold these men for court-martial.

22
00:03:00,176 --> 00:03:02,542
They'll pluck those
cocky rooster feathers out of your tail

23
00:03:02,612 --> 00:03:05,546
-for court-martialing civilians.
-Civilians indeed.

24
00:03:05,914 --> 00:03:08,347
-Deserters, more likely.
-We're civilians!

25
00:03:08,415 --> 00:03:11,679
Born in Pennsylvania, taken
three years ago by Caughnawaga lndians.

26
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:13,510
We're initiated to the tribe.

27
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:15,610
You can tell your story to a court-martial.

28
00:03:15,687 --> 00:03:18,280
lf you're not a fool,
l reckon you'll listen to it here!

29
00:03:18,356 --> 00:03:20,789
We escaped
while the tribe visited Quebec.

30
00:03:20,857 --> 00:03:22,586
The French caught us and here we are.

31
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:24,626
Shackle these men
with the rest of the deserters.

32
00:03:24,693 --> 00:03:25,955
We're civilians!

33
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:27,688
You've no right to hold us here!

34
00:03:27,762 --> 00:03:29,127
Colonel Clapp, Captain Swanson.

35
00:03:29,197 --> 00:03:33,394
l'd like to get you behind a barn,
back home in Pennsylvania !

36
00:03:36,935 --> 00:03:38,368
Jim !

37
00:03:39,037 --> 00:03:40,628
And the Professor.

38
00:03:41,005 --> 00:03:43,496
-Where have you been?
-We were taken by the Caughnawagas.

39
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:46,542
-You still got your scalps.
-They made us blood brothers.

40
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:49,736
-Are these friends of yours?
-Aye. Let me introduce you.

41
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:52,571
There's Jim Smith and the Professor.
From Pennsylvania.

42
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:55,638
l thought they were dead.
They've been missing these three years.

43
00:03:55,715 --> 00:03:57,511
The best lndian fighters in the colonies.

44
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,778
All right, Corporal, you may release them.

45
00:03:59,852 --> 00:04:01,182
You'd better read your dispatch, Captain.

46
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,058
Gentlemen, Quebec is English.

47
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:15,490
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!

48
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,994
Quebec is British.

49
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:20,393
That closes the frontier.

50
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:22,558
There's no more
stirring up the lndians against us.

51
00:04:22,634 --> 00:04:24,032
No more massacres.

52
00:04:24,268 --> 00:04:25,360
Thank God.

53
00:04:25,603 --> 00:04:28,070
General Wolfe said he'd do it
and he's done it.

54
00:04:28,138 --> 00:04:29,935
General Wolfe is dead, sir.

55
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:32,232
He died with his face to the enemy.

56
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,509
l guess we can go home now, Mac.

57
00:04:55,057 --> 00:04:57,490
Maybe our stomachs found a friend.

58
00:05:00,261 --> 00:05:01,887
All right, come on, boys.
You've had your hot meal.

59
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:03,258
Now back to work.

60
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,025
Break stone, Teagle,
help Spode with that axle.

61
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:15,569
-MacDougall.
-Hiya, laddie.

62
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:20,433
l heard you was up in Canada with
General Wolfe, fighting the French.

63
00:05:20,507 --> 00:05:23,374
l was just showing the General
how to fight lndians.

64
00:05:23,444 --> 00:05:26,640
l killed 30 Onondagas in one day. Aye.

65
00:05:26,713 --> 00:05:28,111
-No.
-Aye.

66
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,545
How dead lndians do multiply!

67
00:05:31,182 --> 00:05:33,275
Well, maybe it was 20 Onondagas,

68
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,249
but that's not to be saying
that a MacDougall like myself

69
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,582
couldn't have killed 30 if he had a mind to.

70
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,918
They're bosom cronies of mine.

71
00:05:40,988 --> 00:05:43,286
-This is Jim Smith and the Professor.
-How are you?

72
00:05:43,358 --> 00:05:46,224
-Strangers around here, ain't you?
-We've been away a little while.

73
00:05:46,293 --> 00:05:48,089
This is Gary Smith's laddie.

74
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,492
-Oh, yeah.
-Could you spare a mite of that grub?

75
00:05:50,562 --> 00:05:53,962
Oh, fall to, lads. We've had ours,
but there's plenty hanging.

76
00:05:54,164 --> 00:05:57,929
l suppose you wouldn't be having a
snifter of whiskey, just a wee drop?

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,797
You know, my appetite's not so good

78
00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:02,598
without a bit of a tonic
just to wet my whistle.

79
00:06:03,338 --> 00:06:05,669
No, Mac, we don't traffic in firewater.

80
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,230
We only carry trade goods for the lndians.

81
00:06:08,742 --> 00:06:11,676
-Trade goods?
-l thought the border was closed.

82
00:06:12,244 --> 00:06:15,644
Don't have to be, now that the French
have surrendered Quebec.

83
00:06:15,747 --> 00:06:19,273
Colonel Brady's out in Ohio
making treaties with the lnjuns now.

84
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,515
They're real friendly-like, the lnjuns.

85
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:26,685
The only friendly lndians
are dead lndians, l say.

86
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,082
lf we don't trade with them,
the French will.

87
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:33,421
You know how they stir them up
against us, with firewater.

88
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,651
lt's a patriotic duty we're doing.

89
00:06:35,727 --> 00:06:38,718
Did you ask Tom Lowther
about this patriotism?

90
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:41,453
The lndians beat in
his boy's head with a musket

91
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:43,658
and left it sticking in his skull.

92
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:51,897
Rum !

93
00:06:52,272 --> 00:06:53,899
So you don't carry any spirits.

94
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,146
Stop! Where are my spoons?

95
00:07:10,218 --> 00:07:13,653
Stop, thief! Stop!

96
00:07:17,623 --> 00:07:19,921
Five pewter spoons missing and a tankard.

97
00:07:19,992 --> 00:07:21,856
Blast them for the thieves that they are

98
00:07:21,926 --> 00:07:23,723
and blast me for the trusting woman l am !

99
00:07:23,795 --> 00:07:27,593
Now, Janie, that'll do, l'll have
no swearing from a daughter of mine.

100
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:31,029
So, you're back.

101
00:07:31,966 --> 00:07:34,433
Now, now, lassie, it was no fault of mine.

102
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:36,435
l was coming home, sober as a judge,

103
00:07:36,503 --> 00:07:39,062
when, bang,
without even a word of apology,

104
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:42,369
a patrol got hold of me
and pressed me into the army.

105
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:43,806
Against my will.

106
00:07:44,942 --> 00:07:47,967
Even when l told them what a beautiful
and dutiful daughter l had.

107
00:07:48,044 --> 00:07:50,910
Who'd tend the tavern while you're away,
swilling army rum?

108
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:51,968
What, me?

109
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:54,015
Why, l've got the best here
in the cellar at home.

110
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:55,673
That you can't get at.

111
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:58,146
Oh, Mac, don't go away
and leave me again.

112
00:07:58,218 --> 00:07:59,845
Take me with you like you used to.

113
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,320
Oh, you contrary female MacDougall!

114
00:08:09,092 --> 00:08:10,218
No.

115
00:08:12,428 --> 00:08:13,656
Hello, Janie.

116
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:15,794
Put me down, Mac.

117
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:19,930
And the Professor, they're back from
the very mouth of the grave.

118
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:22,928
They'd all say,
''He's dead, you'd better forget him.''

119
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:27,335
And l'd say ''Sure, he's dead,
he's forgotten,'' but l knew it wasn't so.

120
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:31,032
l didn't let myself know anything else,
l knew you'd come back.

121
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:34,601
And just where were you,
and what were you doing?

122
00:08:34,677 --> 00:08:37,077
-Well, a...
-Oh, no, no, l don't care.

123
00:08:37,745 --> 00:08:39,076
You're here now.

124
00:08:41,982 --> 00:08:45,144
Blast it, Mac, do you have to stand around
and watch a girl make a fool of herself?

125
00:08:45,218 --> 00:08:48,015
Get in and get your rum.
And you, too, Professor.

126
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,449
lt is a wee bit chilly.

127
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:55,888
You've grown up, Janie.

128
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:58,426
lsn't that much nicer, for both of us?

129
00:08:58,627 --> 00:09:00,618
Still the same shameless wench.

130
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:02,454
Am l supposed to be ashamed?

131
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,555
l will be if you want me to,
but l don't feel ashamed,

132
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:08,498
-not before the man l'm going to marry.
-Marry?

133
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:11,967
Yes, you gave me your word,
you promised, don't you remember?

134
00:09:13,238 --> 00:09:14,761
There's another girl!

135
00:09:15,072 --> 00:09:17,267
Somewhere you've hitched yourself
to another girl!

136
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:19,137
Blast you for a bigamist scoundrel!

137
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,573
-Your temper is no better.
-l'll have the law on you!

138
00:09:21,643 --> 00:09:24,134
l'll have you put in stocks
for breaking your promise!

139
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:28,237
-l promised a half-grown girl.
-Half-grown? Half-grown?

140
00:09:28,314 --> 00:09:30,782
Stop whimpering about marriage.

141
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,113
We're very hungry and tired men.

142
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,213
Come inside, Jim.

143
00:09:40,023 --> 00:09:43,788
Half-grown, am l?
Well, l'm full-grown, now.

144
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:08,533
l killed 40 Onondagas in one day.

145
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:13,876
The barrel of my gun, it got so hot,
l used it to warm up the rum toddies.

146
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,372
lt got so hot, l...

147
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:22,040
The war is over, Mac. Come on,
get behind the bar and work for your keep.

148
00:10:22,352 --> 00:10:23,683
Woe is me.

149
00:10:24,521 --> 00:10:27,546
l'm a victim of the skirling blood
of the MacDougalls.

150
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,187
Janie, are you happy?

151
00:10:33,627 --> 00:10:35,150
Oh, mind your pig.

152
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:46,334
What am l to do?

153
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:48,828
The whole town knows
we were going to be married.

154
00:10:48,904 --> 00:10:50,235
Now you've changed your mind.

155
00:10:50,306 --> 00:10:53,172
Why don't you put a rein
to your nimble imagination, girl?

156
00:10:53,241 --> 00:10:54,935
Let him do his own talking.

157
00:10:55,008 --> 00:10:57,135
The Professor always talks for me.

158
00:10:57,244 --> 00:10:59,143
You only thought he promised.

159
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,379
They'll point me out as a girl who was left.

160
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:05,004
Well, then, marry and fool them.

161
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:07,812
Who'll have me
after you've tossed me aside?

162
00:11:09,052 --> 00:11:12,214
Well, l don't know.

163
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:14,246
You're not bad to look at.

164
00:11:14,323 --> 00:11:15,687
l think so, too.

165
00:11:16,123 --> 00:11:18,522
But maybe it's because
we've lived with lndians so long.

166
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:21,220
You're an lndian, cruel and merciless!

167
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:25,093
Janie, l'm no man for you.

168
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:28,762
-He's going over the far hills too much.
-l wouldn't care!

169
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:31,890
l wouldn't ask for anything
except to go with you.

170
00:11:31,968 --> 00:11:35,266
You can't die once,
and then come alive and go away again.

171
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,134
lt's like making me see you die twice,
l couldn't stand it.

172
00:11:40,975 --> 00:11:44,535
Jed, Tom... lndians.

173
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:47,044
lndians. They're all around Fort Pitt.

174
00:11:47,112 --> 00:11:48,601
Shawnee and Delaware.

175
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,237
They've burned the town

176
00:11:50,314 --> 00:11:53,077
and they've scalped the kids in school
at McDowell's Mill.

177
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:54,673
Let's be on the way, boys.

178
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,116
McDowell's Mill is 20 miles from here.

179
00:11:57,186 --> 00:11:59,915
-Any more guns in the house?
-Two long rifles.

180
00:12:00,288 --> 00:12:02,653
Well, l know
where we can get some more.

181
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,856
You're not going again, Jim, you're not!

182
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,483
Mac, Mac, tell him not to go!

183
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,120
Don't be a fool, lassie,
you know what we have to do.

184
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,604
All dead, Jim. Horrible.

185
00:12:38,414 --> 00:12:40,006
Dirty, murdering heathens.

186
00:12:40,082 --> 00:12:42,948
l'm taking my family
and leaving while we're still alive.

187
00:12:43,018 --> 00:12:44,645
Aye. l'm fair sick of it.

188
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:47,209
A remarkably fine season
and what good is it?

189
00:12:47,287 --> 00:12:50,346
You can't harvest
for fear of bloodthirsty barbarians.

190
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:54,284
Men, if the Conococheague settlements
stand firm

191
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,924
the country will have
some little sort of safety.

192
00:12:57,028 --> 00:12:59,325
Safe for the blasted tradesmen.

193
00:12:59,396 --> 00:13:01,159
For the fields of corn you planted.

194
00:13:01,231 --> 00:13:03,494
For the plenty we've taken
and will take from this land.

195
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:05,623
l will water it with my blood
before l give it up.

196
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,531
-And l.
-And l.

197
00:13:07,602 --> 00:13:08,932
Everybody accounted for?

198
00:13:09,002 --> 00:13:12,334
All except Jacob Miller's two kids.
They must have taken them alive.

199
00:13:18,243 --> 00:13:21,405
Mrs. Lewis, do you know
if Jacob Miller's kids got taken?

200
00:13:22,612 --> 00:13:23,772
Mrs. Lewis?

201
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:36,217
l picked up the tracks.

202
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:38,847
About 20 of them. Delawares, l think.
l'm not sure,

203
00:13:38,923 --> 00:13:40,447
but they seem to have
a couple of youngsters with them.

204
00:13:40,525 --> 00:13:41,957
-Any missing?
-Yes.

205
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:44,055
l want about 10 men with me.

206
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:48,028
Stewart, Calhoon, M'Cammon, Professor.

207
00:13:48,097 --> 00:13:50,394
You got plenty of charcoal over there,
M'Cammon?

208
00:13:50,465 --> 00:13:52,455
Yes, and plenty of bear grease.

209
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,866
Now, we're traveling light,
so are the Delawares

210
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,994
but they'll be held back
because they're carrying the kids along.

211
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,631
Twenty of them. lt's just the odds l like.

212
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,004
l'll kill them myself
like l did them Onondagas in one day.

213
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:07,301
l wanna see your guns.

214
00:14:11,747 --> 00:14:14,613
Trade musket. They're no good.
They misfire too often.

215
00:14:15,282 --> 00:14:16,909
Sorry, M'Cammon,
we can't take you with us.

216
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:19,177
lf it misfires, Jim, l'll use my knife.

217
00:14:19,251 --> 00:14:21,685
l'm only taking men
with long rifles, M'Cammon.

218
00:14:21,754 --> 00:14:26,052
-Mac! Mac!
-Janie, lassie. What brought you here?

219
00:14:26,256 --> 00:14:28,247
With lndians loose,
you might have been scalped

220
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,383
from your eyebrows
to your shoulder blades.

221
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,154
Here, l'll get somebody to take you back.

222
00:14:32,227 --> 00:14:33,956
l'm not going back.

223
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:36,861
l've seen what the lndians did
and l'm going with you.

224
00:14:36,931 --> 00:14:38,193
-l forbid it.
-What?

225
00:14:38,265 --> 00:14:39,253
Positively.

226
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:40,629
You forbid it?

227
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:43,060
How much is this valley your home?

228
00:14:43,402 --> 00:14:45,869
Did you see those bullet holes
in the walls of the tavern?

229
00:14:45,937 --> 00:14:48,167
Who fought off the lndians? Not you.

230
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:51,139
You were always busy somewhere else
fighting somebody else's fight.

231
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,573
And now you're forbidding me
to fight my own.

232
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,007
-Get back to the tavern, girl.
-Let her come along.

233
00:14:56,077 --> 00:14:59,341
Oh, Jim.
Jim, you're a fine and generous man.

234
00:15:01,081 --> 00:15:04,413
All right, off with your shirts.
Smear your bodies.

235
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:06,611
We're lndians, you know.

236
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,187
Well, off with your shirt.

237
00:15:10,254 --> 00:15:13,222
lf you travel with us
you travel like the rest of us.

238
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:20,218
How sly. How very sly.

239
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:24,426
We'll need your long rifle.

240
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:27,195
-Here's your weapon, M'Cammon.
-Thanks.

241
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,493
Some of you boys
see that Janie gets home.

242
00:15:59,355 --> 00:16:01,084
They didn't come out here.

243
00:16:01,924 --> 00:16:03,754
We'll have to split up, Jim.

244
00:16:22,137 --> 00:16:25,572
Delawares. They've gone upstream.

245
00:16:26,707 --> 00:16:29,231
Mac, you take the right bank,
l'll take the left.

246
00:17:29,084 --> 00:17:30,108
l want him alive.

247
00:17:30,185 --> 00:17:34,314
Jim, 20 lndians a day
has always been my minimum.

248
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:36,045
Don't leave me at 19.

249
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,783
l'll never be able to hold me head up again.

250
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:39,188
Come on, we'll get the water out of him.

251
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,419
Oh, darn, Jim, laddie.

252
00:17:53,368 --> 00:17:55,733
They trade muskets and trade tomahawks.

253
00:17:58,172 --> 00:18:00,196
-Everybody all right?
-All right.

254
00:18:00,306 --> 00:18:01,432
All here.

255
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:04,098
Gather up the rifles and the powder horns.

256
00:18:09,145 --> 00:18:10,874
English cartouche box.

257
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,610
What regiment is it, Tom?

258
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:15,445
Why, that's Colonel Brady's regiment.

259
00:18:15,517 --> 00:18:18,485
He's supposed to be out on the Ohio
making treaties.

260
00:18:42,136 --> 00:18:44,535
He said
they wiped out Brady and the men.

261
00:19:01,616 --> 00:19:03,674
We teach them everything, don't we, Tom?

262
00:19:15,926 --> 00:19:18,895
His Excellency, Governor Penn,
will see you tomorrow.

263
00:19:19,395 --> 00:19:20,521
Thank you.

264
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:37,533
What is the meaning of this intrusion?

265
00:19:37,608 --> 00:19:39,041
l sent word l'd see you tomorrow.

266
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:40,700
What we've got to say
can't wait till tomorrow.

267
00:19:40,777 --> 00:19:42,767
-Why, how dare...
-Our apologies, Your Excellency,

268
00:19:42,844 --> 00:19:45,937
-we're Conococheague Valley men.
-l see.

269
00:19:46,781 --> 00:19:48,681
Frightful tragedy, frightful.

270
00:19:49,482 --> 00:19:52,644
This is General Gage,
in command of His Majesty's forces.

271
00:19:52,885 --> 00:19:56,752
We've come to request Your Excellency
to forbid trade with the lndians,

272
00:19:57,121 --> 00:19:59,748
and to ask military protection
for the valley.

273
00:20:00,057 --> 00:20:02,684
l understand and sympathize with you,

274
00:20:03,326 --> 00:20:06,624
but l have judged it consistent
with the good of His Majesty's service

275
00:20:06,695 --> 00:20:08,925
to order all available troops westward

276
00:20:08,997 --> 00:20:11,123
to meet the lndians on their own grounds.

277
00:20:11,198 --> 00:20:13,495
While they murder us on our grounds.

278
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,267
We're carrying out a military policy

279
00:20:16,501 --> 00:20:19,936
designed to guarantee
the permanent security of the frontier.

280
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:22,566
Haven't you eyes enough to see that?

281
00:20:22,672 --> 00:20:25,163
We've eyes enough
to see only our own dead.

282
00:20:25,342 --> 00:20:27,673
Colonel Brady has received
the lndian chieftains...

283
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:29,642
Colonel Brady
will receive no more chieftains...

284
00:20:29,711 --> 00:20:30,803
What's that? What's that?

285
00:20:30,878 --> 00:20:32,811
Dead men make no peace treaties.

286
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:35,871
-What are you saying?
-Colonel Brady and his men are dead.

287
00:20:35,949 --> 00:20:36,972
Dead?

288
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:40,814
Their heads split open
with tomahawks made by white men.

289
00:20:49,992 --> 00:20:54,018
''A proclamation. From this day
all persons whosoever they may be,

290
00:20:54,095 --> 00:20:55,926
''are forbidden to trade with lndians.

291
00:20:56,162 --> 00:20:59,256
''Anyone failing to heed this warning,
does so at his own peril.

292
00:20:59,332 --> 00:21:02,232
''The Valley of the Conococheague
is forthwith taxed £1 per capita

293
00:21:02,301 --> 00:21:05,997
''for the erection of Fort Loudoun, and
the maintenance of His Majesty's troop

294
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,197
''to be permanently stationed there
for the protection of said valley.

295
00:21:09,272 --> 00:21:11,569
''John Penn. God save the King.''

296
00:21:12,308 --> 00:21:15,276
This is the reward of aiding
the mother country with her trade.

297
00:21:15,343 --> 00:21:17,242
Warehouses filled with goods.

298
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:20,540
Goods that cost us hard cash,
fetched 3,000 miles from England.

299
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,910
Must we endure it?

300
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:24,312
What's the army for,
if not to protect business?

301
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,942
And what's government for,
if not to protect business?

302
00:21:27,018 --> 00:21:28,645
Certainly not to interfere with it.

303
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:31,949
Gentlemen, you still do business
with the army, don't you?

304
00:21:32,155 --> 00:21:35,749
lt will take 20 years for the army to buy up
the supplies we have on hand,

305
00:21:35,824 --> 00:21:37,484
and furthermore, there's no profit in it.

306
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:39,287
l wasn't thinking of that.

307
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:43,094
You'll have a military permit to take goods
through to the outlying forts, won't you?

308
00:21:43,162 --> 00:21:44,151
Yes.

309
00:21:45,364 --> 00:21:47,297
Now, if a shipping clerk made a mistake,

310
00:21:47,365 --> 00:21:50,993
and sent a few wagonloads of trade goods
through with the military supplies,

311
00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:55,231
they'd be traveling under the protection
of a military pass, wouldn't they?

312
00:21:55,371 --> 00:21:57,634
-Barmaid, barmaid!
-Yes, sir.

313
00:21:57,706 --> 00:21:59,037
Another for each of us.

314
00:21:59,107 --> 00:22:02,041
All right, boys. Get out the musket balls.

315
00:22:13,517 --> 00:22:15,542
Fifty keg of musket ball for Fort Pitt.

316
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:18,314
Fifty keg of musket ball for Fort Pitt. Right.

317
00:22:25,325 --> 00:22:28,225
Put the musket balls aside.
We load them on the top.

318
00:22:35,232 --> 00:22:37,722
l'll kill the man
that drops a keg of that rum.

319
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,634
-This is it, sir.
-Give the order to halt, Sergeant.

320
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:53,438
-Company, halt!
-Company, halt!

321
00:22:59,316 --> 00:23:00,441
A tavern?

322
00:23:00,817 --> 00:23:03,012
Their magistrates and commissioners
meet in a tavern?

323
00:23:03,085 --> 00:23:05,883
Yes, sir.
Most every place in the outlying sections,

324
00:23:05,954 --> 00:23:07,784
the tavern's sort of
community public house,

325
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:10,152
-government quarters, newspaper...
-Accompany me inside, Sergeant.

326
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,212
Yes, sir.

327
00:23:16,427 --> 00:23:18,327
l'm Captain Swanson.
Who's in charge here?

328
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:21,558
Magistrate Duncan and Magistrate Morris,
they're in charge.

329
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:24,394
Glad to meet you, gentlemen.
l'm sure we shall get on.

330
00:23:24,467 --> 00:23:27,435
May l say how grateful we are
to have you and your men, Captain?

331
00:23:27,502 --> 00:23:30,265
Your gratitude belongs to the Crown,
Mr. Magistrate.

332
00:23:30,337 --> 00:23:32,271
We're all servants of His Majesty.

333
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:33,566
Now, as to provisions,

334
00:23:33,639 --> 00:23:36,199
Sergeant McGlashan
will weekly requisition our needs.

335
00:23:36,275 --> 00:23:38,708
You'll be given army certificates
redeemable in cash.

336
00:23:38,777 --> 00:23:41,677
-That ought to be satisfactory.
-We'll be happy to accommodate you, sir.

337
00:23:41,745 --> 00:23:45,111
All provisions delivered to the fort
are to be in prime condition.

338
00:23:45,181 --> 00:23:47,341
Any attempts to supply
provisions of inferior quality

339
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:49,316
will be met by severe rebuke.

340
00:23:50,084 --> 00:23:52,814
Severe rebuke.
Do l make myself clear, gentlemen?

341
00:23:52,887 --> 00:23:56,287
You don't know us, sir,
otherwise you wouldn't be saying that.

342
00:23:57,156 --> 00:23:59,090
You will notify me each week
when the provisions arrive.

343
00:23:59,158 --> 00:24:00,749
-Yes, sir.
-l will make the inspections myself.

344
00:24:00,825 --> 00:24:02,383
That's all, gentlemen.

345
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,393
Why, the uppish gamecock.

346
00:24:05,562 --> 00:24:08,530
-l demand that man's arrest.
-On what charge?

347
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:12,592
The man was in contempt of court.

348
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:14,166
You're not sitting in a military session,

349
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:16,964
exchanging prisoners now,
Captain Swanson.

350
00:24:17,036 --> 00:24:18,469
For which l'm grateful.

351
00:24:18,538 --> 00:24:22,029
l rather resent the army
gambling on exchange and losing.

352
00:24:22,741 --> 00:24:24,332
This is a civil court.

353
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:27,973
And l advise you
to keep that kind of a tongue in your head.

354
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:29,905
Jim, Captain Jim !

355
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:31,879
Them blackguards
has took up the trade again.

356
00:24:31,947 --> 00:24:34,380
They come through Shippensburg
this morning, three wagons.

357
00:24:34,449 --> 00:24:36,383
-You mean with trade goods?
-Yes.

358
00:24:36,451 --> 00:24:38,543
They wouldn't dare, they wouldn't dare.

359
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:40,745
With the King's proclamation
on the door of every inn

360
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,720
and every magistrate's house.

361
00:24:42,788 --> 00:24:44,652
-lt must be army goods.
-lt ain't. l seen them.

362
00:24:44,723 --> 00:24:47,350
lt's paint, knives
and hatchets and powder.

363
00:24:47,424 --> 00:24:48,413
You'll turn them back, of course.

364
00:24:48,492 --> 00:24:49,982
Are you sure of your information?

365
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:52,755
Sure of it? l tried to reason with them.

366
00:24:52,896 --> 00:24:55,489
They said, ''Get the devil out of the valley
if you're scared of lndians.''

367
00:24:55,564 --> 00:24:57,724
-Why weren't they stopped at Carlisle?
-Stop them?

368
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:00,925
They've got a military permit signed by
the Commanding Officer in Philadelphia.

369
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:02,400
You must be mistaken.

370
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:04,698
lf the goods are under permit,
they're military supplies.

371
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,169
l ain't mistaken.

372
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,538
Are you implying
that my commanding officer is corrupt?

373
00:25:09,607 --> 00:25:10,732
You'd best mind your tongue.

374
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:12,331
He's implying nothing,

375
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:15,741
but for us to let those goods go through
would be committing suicide.

376
00:25:15,811 --> 00:25:18,608
l'll arrest any man
that interferes with a military permit.

377
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,806
Then you're going to let
the goods go through?

378
00:25:20,881 --> 00:25:22,508
My orders were to protect the frontier,

379
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:26,541
and to teach a wholesome respect for the
Sovereign law and His Majesty's forces.

380
00:25:26,619 --> 00:25:30,144
Those orders will be carried out,
even if l have to declare martial law.

381
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,224
And to think we asked for them.

382
00:25:40,295 --> 00:25:44,196
The swine, the crooked swine.
We'll stop them ourselves.

383
00:25:44,965 --> 00:25:48,263
lf it's force you're thinking of using,
you'd best forget it.

384
00:25:48,334 --> 00:25:51,564
-You'll end in hanging.
-Then we'll hang.

385
00:25:51,636 --> 00:25:53,660
At least we'll die with our scalps intact.

386
00:25:53,737 --> 00:25:56,864
Calhoon, l think you could do with a drink,

387
00:25:58,107 --> 00:25:59,904
-as can Mac...
-Aye.

388
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,203
...and the Professor.

389
00:26:01,276 --> 00:26:03,903
M'Cammon and a few of you other boys,
come to my room.

390
00:26:09,816 --> 00:26:11,749
Janie, bring some hot toddies.

391
00:26:11,817 --> 00:26:14,842
Looks like it's going to be a cold night out.
We've work to do.

392
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,120
-Ready?
-Aye.

393
00:26:23,226 --> 00:26:24,214
Aye.

394
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,647
Blankets off.

395
00:27:05,154 --> 00:27:08,145
Each man 10 feet apart.
Shoot over their heads.

396
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:12,153
Get rid of that blanket.

397
00:27:13,227 --> 00:27:15,023
What's the matter with you?

398
00:27:17,796 --> 00:27:20,491
-Are you drunk?
-You're choking me.

399
00:27:21,466 --> 00:27:24,161
Janie, what kind of a joke is this?

400
00:27:24,401 --> 00:27:25,561
lt's not a joke, Jim.

401
00:27:25,636 --> 00:27:28,001
lf you're going to hang, l'll hang with you.

402
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,867
That's the least you can let me do.

403
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:33,567
Ah, the female MacDougalls
were all famed for their tenderness.

404
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,441
The lass is fair daft about you, Jimmy.

405
00:27:43,515 --> 00:27:44,674
All right, men.

406
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,992
Hold it!

407
00:28:13,236 --> 00:28:14,964
Steady down these horses!

408
00:28:17,005 --> 00:28:18,232
Listen to me!

409
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:22,369
Take these loads out in the clearing
and pile them all in one place.

410
00:28:22,442 --> 00:28:24,068
And be fast about it.

411
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:28,872
Take whatever government property you
may be carrying and clear out. Get out!

412
00:29:17,347 --> 00:29:18,814
All right, boys.

413
00:29:32,091 --> 00:29:33,558
Pile the rest of this stuff up, boys.

414
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:36,218
We're going to light a little fire of our own.

415
00:29:36,294 --> 00:29:39,126
Get all the stuff out of all those wagons.

416
00:29:39,796 --> 00:29:41,990
l don't think the government is going
to like very much

417
00:29:42,064 --> 00:29:44,032
this destruction of their property.

418
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,630
Come in.

419
00:29:52,572 --> 00:29:55,062
-Sorry to disturb you, sir, but...
-l'm Callendar.

420
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,403
l pack train for Poole and Simmons,
Philadelphia.

421
00:29:57,475 --> 00:29:59,033
-Charmed.
-We contract army supplies.

422
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,804
Go on, get on with it, get on with it.

423
00:30:00,877 --> 00:30:02,845
A pack of blasted settlers,
dressed like lndians,

424
00:30:02,912 --> 00:30:04,970
attacked my train
and burned the army goods.

425
00:30:05,047 --> 00:30:06,173
Army goods?

426
00:30:06,749 --> 00:30:08,841
There's a cartouche box.
That's all that's left.

427
00:30:08,916 --> 00:30:10,577
The shot's melted down, the powder is...

428
00:30:10,651 --> 00:30:13,118
-McGlashan, call out the squad.
-Yes, sir.

429
00:30:14,054 --> 00:30:18,989
-Nearly murdered me and my men.
-Rabble, cutthroats, criminals!

430
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:21,223
Destroy His Majesty's goods, will they?

431
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:22,758
l'll teach them
the meaning of the King's name,

432
00:30:22,826 --> 00:30:24,952
if l have to write it across their backs
with a lash!

433
00:30:40,938 --> 00:30:42,303
Look alive, men.

434
00:30:44,374 --> 00:30:47,343
-Quick, get him.
-Aye, he's one of them.

435
00:30:47,543 --> 00:30:48,601
l'll brook no escape.

436
00:30:48,677 --> 00:30:50,770
You can still see the black paint
behind his ears.

437
00:30:50,846 --> 00:30:54,211
That's dirt. l never wash behind the ears.
Let go!

438
00:30:54,948 --> 00:30:56,415
lt's a girl!

439
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,175
Hold her.

440
00:31:01,453 --> 00:31:04,751
The man that loosens her
receives 30 days' bread and water.

441
00:31:07,624 --> 00:31:10,525
Who were the others with you?
What were their names?

442
00:31:10,894 --> 00:31:12,258
Just like that.

443
00:31:12,394 --> 00:31:15,089
You'll wear the seat out of those
silk britches before l talk.

444
00:31:15,163 --> 00:31:16,289
Janie!

445
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,528
What did you take her for?

446
00:31:22,802 --> 00:31:26,032
-For destroying King's property.
-She's destroyed no King's property.

447
00:31:26,104 --> 00:31:28,037
McGlashan, clear this rabble.

448
00:31:28,105 --> 00:31:30,005
You'll not take the lass to Fort Loudoun
without a warrant.

449
00:31:30,073 --> 00:31:32,768
By the living Jehoshaphat,
l'll blow out your heart.

450
00:31:32,842 --> 00:31:35,435
You'll do what, you treasonable dog?

451
00:31:37,012 --> 00:31:38,171
Disarm them.

452
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,209
Now, shall we get on
to the fort, McGlashan?

453
00:31:47,286 --> 00:31:48,274
Yes, sir.

454
00:32:06,699 --> 00:32:08,962
Company, halt!

455
00:32:09,968 --> 00:32:12,561
What do you mean by halting
the King's men with an armed mob?

456
00:32:12,636 --> 00:32:14,626
We want those prisoners, Captain.

457
00:32:14,704 --> 00:32:16,331
You took them without warrant.

458
00:32:16,406 --> 00:32:20,273
-There's still English law in the valley.
-They're British and freeborn.

459
00:32:20,342 --> 00:32:22,901
lf they're to stand trial,
it will be before 12 of their peers,

460
00:32:22,977 --> 00:32:24,342
not before the likes of you.

461
00:32:24,412 --> 00:32:28,403
l've an idea they'd be
court-martialed for treason, is that true?

462
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:30,475
And suppose it is?

463
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:32,912
Suppose l send them to Carlisle
for court-martial,

464
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,712
what will you do about it?

465
00:32:35,152 --> 00:32:36,414
We'll do this.

466
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:38,977
We'll be forced to fire on you.

467
00:32:39,055 --> 00:32:41,488
No, Jim, Mac, we'll go with them.

468
00:32:41,556 --> 00:32:43,490
Move the prisoners to the rear
and fix bayonets.

469
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:44,615
No.

470
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:03,100
Perhaps you'll understand
we mean to have those prisoners.

471
00:33:05,707 --> 00:33:07,834
l'll release them only to your magistrate

472
00:33:07,908 --> 00:33:10,604
under the condition
they stand trial for treason.

473
00:33:10,677 --> 00:33:12,667
l'll see that they stand trial.

474
00:33:12,778 --> 00:33:14,370
Release the prisoners.

475
00:33:14,746 --> 00:33:16,338
Release the prisoners.

476
00:33:17,782 --> 00:33:20,045
Will you promise to stop the traders?

477
00:33:20,117 --> 00:33:21,708
You have this promise,

478
00:33:21,784 --> 00:33:24,184
that any man
who interferes with a military permit

479
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:26,721
will make the acquaintance
of the hangman.

480
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:30,455
Shoulder your firelocks, quick step, march.

481
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:44,300
We'll sew up this valley so tight,

482
00:33:44,368 --> 00:33:46,733
a cricket can't get in or out
without our say-so.

483
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,297
No. Turn back.

484
00:33:50,772 --> 00:33:52,432
The valley is closed. Turn back.

485
00:33:52,506 --> 00:33:54,996
-Stop. The valley is closed.
-Stop. Turn back.

486
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,338
-The valley is closed.
-Stop. Turn back.

487
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,502
The valley is closed. Turn back.

488
00:33:59,778 --> 00:34:02,143
Turn back. The valley is closed. Turn back.

489
00:34:13,187 --> 00:34:14,710
''Men of the Conococheague,

490
00:34:14,788 --> 00:34:16,119
''you are to come to MacDougall's Tavern

491
00:34:16,189 --> 00:34:18,281
''and fill yourselves
with liquor and swearing.

492
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:21,416
''There is a large bounty for everyone,
military goods.

493
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:24,522
''We'll have Captain Swanson whipped
or hanged.''

494
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,858
Don't you think this is a little obvious?

495
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:29,956
You gotta make it plain.
Them people are thick-headed.

496
00:34:30,266 --> 00:34:33,723
''We may do as we please for we have
the law and government in our hands.

497
00:34:33,802 --> 00:34:36,361
''Any bounty captured
must be spent in our town,

498
00:34:36,437 --> 00:34:39,530
''the only town tolerating drinking,
swearing, Sabbath-breaking,

499
00:34:39,606 --> 00:34:42,267
''and any outrage we have a mind to do.

500
00:34:42,608 --> 00:34:46,441
''Signed, James Smith and his
Black Boys of the Conococheague.''

501
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:50,105
Well, it should convince the Governor
he's dealing with rioters and rebels.

502
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,105
They've blockaded the valley.

503
00:34:53,182 --> 00:34:55,649
No word can get through
except what they choose.

504
00:34:55,717 --> 00:34:59,174
They wouldn't dare treat
His Majesty's troops with such indignity.

505
00:34:59,253 --> 00:35:00,481
They've no respect for law.

506
00:35:00,554 --> 00:35:02,714
Their magistrates are with them,
leading them.

507
00:35:02,789 --> 00:35:04,780
Have Magistrate Duncan come in.

508
00:35:05,524 --> 00:35:08,118
l've called their magistrate to Philadelphia.

509
00:35:09,627 --> 00:35:10,992
Magistrate Duncan.

510
00:35:18,766 --> 00:35:20,165
This gentleman informs me

511
00:35:20,234 --> 00:35:24,169
that you've encouraged and protected
rioters in the Conococheague Valley

512
00:35:24,404 --> 00:35:26,894
in their illegal and disorderly proceedings.

513
00:35:26,973 --> 00:35:29,668
There have been no illegal
nor disorderly proceedings.

514
00:35:29,741 --> 00:35:32,265
Burned my goods. They burned my goods.

515
00:35:32,343 --> 00:35:34,277
The pack train was illegal,
Your Excellency,

516
00:35:34,345 --> 00:35:36,244
contrary to your proclamation.

517
00:35:36,312 --> 00:35:38,302
There's what's left of the military supplies.

518
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,847
Does that look like trade goods?

519
00:35:39,915 --> 00:35:42,041
This gentleman has been misinformed.

520
00:35:42,116 --> 00:35:44,084
They were not government goods.

521
00:35:44,318 --> 00:35:46,114
Were government troops fired upon?

522
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:49,916
Not one shot has been fired against
the royal garrison, Your Excellency.

523
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:52,548
l swear those goods
were lndian trade goods.

524
00:35:52,624 --> 00:35:54,353
More than that l cannot say.

525
00:35:54,425 --> 00:35:56,153
More than that l will say.

526
00:35:56,326 --> 00:35:58,885
My pack leader managed to
evade the blockade.

527
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,255
Callendar.

528
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:07,129
Where's that advertisement?

529
00:36:08,635 --> 00:36:11,604
These were found nailed to the trees
all through the Conococheague Valley.

530
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,036
The one you have in your hand was taken
from the wall of MacDougall's Tavern.

531
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,336
Sound reason
for everything they've done, indeed.

532
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:18,806
Bloody-minded cutthroats!

533
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,342
May l see it, sir?

534
00:36:22,544 --> 00:36:26,445
There's something queer
about this advertisement, mighty queer.

535
00:36:27,315 --> 00:36:29,509
No Conococheague man ever did this.

536
00:36:29,983 --> 00:36:33,713
l find it disagreeably necessary
to apply to General Gage

537
00:36:33,853 --> 00:36:36,377
for the assistance of His Majesty's troops.

538
00:36:37,288 --> 00:36:39,687
Reinforcements will be
ready to march in a week.

539
00:36:39,757 --> 00:36:42,088
l demand military escort
for my supply train.

540
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,216
You shall have it.

541
00:36:43,292 --> 00:36:46,658
You will issue a warrant
for the apprehension of James Smith.

542
00:36:46,962 --> 00:36:48,020
You will lend your assistance

543
00:36:48,096 --> 00:36:51,553
in discovering and apprehending
all persons who may be concerned.

544
00:36:51,632 --> 00:36:55,532
l issue no warrants against Jim Smith
or any of the valley men.

545
00:37:27,457 --> 00:37:29,686
-Jim? Where's Jim?
-There he is.

546
00:37:29,925 --> 00:37:33,553
Jim, they're issuing a warrant
for your arrest. You've got to leave.

547
00:37:33,628 --> 00:37:35,822
Governor Penn himself is issuing it.

548
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,389
And General Gage is sending
reinforcements in a few days

549
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,557
to put down the insurrection.

550
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,861
-You must go, Jim.
-No.

551
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:43,594
Those traders
will do anything to hang you.

552
00:37:43,668 --> 00:37:47,000
And Gage has promised them
military escort for their pack trains.

553
00:37:47,071 --> 00:37:51,097
Callendar will probably rush through
a train before the reinforcements arrive.

554
00:37:51,174 --> 00:37:53,607
He'll be afraid to wait
with too many soldiers about.

555
00:37:53,675 --> 00:37:56,040
He will that,
if he's carrying lndian trade goods.

556
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,442
-Well, we'll let the train through.
-Let it through?

557
00:37:58,512 --> 00:37:59,569
Jim, are you crazy?

558
00:37:59,646 --> 00:38:01,773
What is it, Jim?
What are you thinking about?

559
00:38:01,848 --> 00:38:03,838
We'll use him as bait for a trap.

560
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:06,509
lf Fort Loudoun
becomes a warehouse for illegal goods,

561
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,347
its commandant is done for.

562
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:11,114
lt'll be proof that he's
unlawfully conniving with traders.

563
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,916
We'll prove we're not rebels.

564
00:38:58,387 --> 00:39:00,752
We have him now. He's taken the bait.

565
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:03,947
Tell the valley men
to come to MacDougall's.

566
00:39:08,695 --> 00:39:11,219
Jim Smith wants you to
come to MacDougall's!

567
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,455
Jim Smith says, ''Come to MacDougall's! ''

568
00:39:14,532 --> 00:39:16,863
Jim Smith says, ''Come to MacDougall's! ''

569
00:39:17,834 --> 00:39:20,199
Jim Smith says, ''Come to MacDougall's.''

570
00:39:20,536 --> 00:39:22,264
-Come to MacDougall's.
-Come to MacDougall's.

571
00:39:22,337 --> 00:39:24,532
-Come to MacDougall's.
-MacDougall's.

572
00:39:24,806 --> 00:39:26,670
Come to MacDougall's.

573
00:39:29,675 --> 00:39:32,871
James, there's your search warrant,
and it's all in order.

574
00:39:32,944 --> 00:39:34,809
You'd better come along to serve it.

575
00:39:47,155 --> 00:39:48,679
Just a minute, men.

576
00:39:49,956 --> 00:39:53,516
M'Cammon, Calhoon, Stewart,
Lewis and Janie here are out on bail.

577
00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:56,091
We promised the Captain
they'd be tried for treason.

578
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:57,753
Now it isn't beholden for men out on bail

579
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:59,819
to be appearing before
a fort making demands.

580
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,626
lf you think it'll be hurting you,
then l'll stay.

581
00:40:01,698 --> 00:40:04,257
That won't be necessary, Tom.
We'll try you immediately.

582
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:05,663
Jim, you can appear for the defense.

583
00:40:05,734 --> 00:40:08,998
l'll choose a jury,
and if it isn't to your liking you can object.

584
00:40:09,069 --> 00:40:10,969
The prisoners over there before the bar

585
00:40:11,038 --> 00:40:14,131
and the jurymen down here on this side
of the table, as l call off your names.

586
00:40:14,207 --> 00:40:19,734
Burke, Callahan, Brown, Reynolds,
Allison, Bouquet, Forbes, Spears,

587
00:40:19,877 --> 00:40:22,004
Josephs, Owens, Grant, Pierry.

588
00:40:25,648 --> 00:40:28,640
-Jim, have you any objections?
-No objections.

589
00:40:30,185 --> 00:40:33,176
Gentlemen, what is your verdict
on Tom Calhoon?

590
00:40:33,253 --> 00:40:34,311
Not guilty.

591
00:40:34,388 --> 00:40:35,911
-John M'Cammon?
-Not guilty.

592
00:40:35,988 --> 00:40:37,250
-Stewart?
-Not guilty.

593
00:40:37,323 --> 00:40:38,813
-Lewis?
-Not guilty.

594
00:40:38,891 --> 00:40:40,858
-Janie McDougall?
-Guilty.

595
00:40:40,926 --> 00:40:42,893
-What?
-Guilty as charged.

596
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,387
MacDougall, the court charges you to
lock your daughter in the wine cellar

597
00:40:46,462 --> 00:40:48,089
until the court has time to pass sentence.

598
00:40:48,164 --> 00:40:49,425
-You...
-Come along, lassie.

599
00:40:49,498 --> 00:40:53,365
The moment you began whispering,
l knew it was some filthy lndian trick!

600
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,635
l think you'd best forget him.

601
00:40:58,905 --> 00:41:00,838
He's bad medicine for lasses.

602
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,037
Mac, what, what's the matter with me?

603
00:41:05,176 --> 00:41:07,166
Why does he treat me like this?

604
00:41:07,644 --> 00:41:11,602
Janie-wanie, you called him right, lndian.

605
00:41:12,614 --> 00:41:15,014
To him a squaw belongs at home.

606
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:16,344
l hate him.

607
00:41:17,218 --> 00:41:21,313
Aye, and if you're like your mother,
you'll break your heart with your hate.

608
00:41:21,821 --> 00:41:24,687
Go on with ye, you MacDougall, you.

609
00:41:59,747 --> 00:42:02,079
Something must be amiss. They let me by.

610
00:42:02,149 --> 00:42:04,480
They've no stomach for firing on troops.

611
00:42:04,551 --> 00:42:08,179
They had the look of cats
that had just swallowed a flock of birds.

612
00:42:08,254 --> 00:42:11,154
They're all about the fort, sir,
close to 300 of them, armed.

613
00:42:11,222 --> 00:42:13,280
-Shut and bolt the gates.
-l've already done that, sir.

614
00:42:13,357 --> 00:42:14,722
Order full garrison on the wall.

615
00:42:54,586 --> 00:42:56,917
What do you mean
by coming here with that rabble?

616
00:42:56,987 --> 00:42:58,420
ln the name of public safety,

617
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:02,049
we want permission to inspect
the trader's goods stored in your fort.

618
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:06,025
You've a rare appreciation of public order
with an armed mob at your back.

619
00:43:06,093 --> 00:43:08,527
l have a search warrant
to inspect the goods.

620
00:43:08,596 --> 00:43:12,156
The goods are under my protection.
l've orders from General Gage.

621
00:43:12,532 --> 00:43:14,089
Here, do you see this?

622
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:16,429
That's General Gage's own order.
What more do you want?

623
00:43:16,501 --> 00:43:19,401
Here, do you see this?
lt's the King's proclamation.

624
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:21,164
We want to see the goods.

625
00:43:21,338 --> 00:43:24,238
Nothing short of that
will satisfy the people around here.

626
00:43:24,307 --> 00:43:26,934
You'll inspect no goods in my care.
l've my orders.

627
00:43:27,008 --> 00:43:29,999
lt might be as well to remember,
this road is not a military road.

628
00:43:30,077 --> 00:43:33,170
And while we're talking,
you might get it through your head.

629
00:43:33,246 --> 00:43:36,806
We built your fort.
We'll not have it used against us.

630
00:43:36,882 --> 00:43:38,577
Now, will you let us in?

631
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:39,775
l will not.

632
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:43,047
You're using our fort
as a storehouse for illegal goods.

633
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,178
According to the King's proclamation,
you're a criminal.

634
00:43:46,255 --> 00:43:49,815
And we'll deal with you as a criminal.
Back, boys.

635
00:44:11,606 --> 00:44:12,630
Be back, boys.

636
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:14,868
We'll kill every mother's son
of them, the dirty rattlesnakes!

637
00:44:14,942 --> 00:44:17,671
Come on, let's get him out of the road.

638
00:44:18,078 --> 00:44:20,978
McGlashan, those men
were under a flag of truce.

639
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,274
-Arrest the man who fired that shot.
-Yes, sir.

640
00:44:23,348 --> 00:44:25,339
Don't jiggle him so much, lads.

641
00:44:25,516 --> 00:44:28,609
l'll put a torch to that fort myself,
if l die doing it.

642
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:32,085
That was no army musket, Tom.

643
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:34,414
lt was a long rifle.

644
00:44:34,489 --> 00:44:36,786
That's right,
it couldn't have been a soldier.

645
00:44:36,857 --> 00:44:38,791
lt was one of Callendar's men.

646
00:44:40,126 --> 00:44:42,526
l never even shot an lndian in the back.

647
00:44:48,366 --> 00:44:50,265
Jim, we'd better ride you
back to the doctor.

648
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:54,063
No, we gotta take that fort
before reinforcements get here.

649
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:55,997
We must have the proof.

650
00:44:57,372 --> 00:44:58,999
Then let's charge them.

651
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,530
That's what they expect.

652
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:09,005
Their muskets won't carry this far,
our long rifles will.

653
00:45:12,082 --> 00:45:16,449
So we'll fire on the fort, and keep firing.
ln shifts.

654
00:45:17,552 --> 00:45:20,349
One shift will rest
while the other keeps firing.

655
00:45:21,922 --> 00:45:24,890
They won't dare go to sleep
waiting for us to charge.

656
00:45:25,959 --> 00:45:27,186
But we won't.

657
00:45:27,826 --> 00:45:29,453
We'll just keep firing.

658
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,597
Jim, could we no kill
two or three of them maybe?

659
00:45:41,169 --> 00:45:42,966
There'll be no killings, Mac.

660
00:45:43,037 --> 00:45:45,528
Don't you think
you'd better get back to the surgeon, Jim?

661
00:45:45,606 --> 00:45:47,300
Give the order to fire.

662
00:46:15,093 --> 00:46:17,959
-Full garrison on the wall, sir.
-Keep your men ready, Sergeant.

663
00:46:18,028 --> 00:46:19,961
Tell them to hold their fire
and watch for the assault.

664
00:46:20,029 --> 00:46:21,018
Yes, sir.

665
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:23,689
Hold your fire, and watch for the assault!

666
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,209
Sergeant McGlashan.

667
00:46:48,516 --> 00:46:49,642
Yes, sir.

668
00:46:49,717 --> 00:46:51,183
Tell the men to
get to the bottom of the barricade

669
00:46:51,251 --> 00:46:52,411
where the logs are the thickest.

670
00:46:52,486 --> 00:46:53,474
Yes, sir.

671
00:46:53,553 --> 00:46:55,316
And tell them that the first man
that falls asleep

672
00:46:55,388 --> 00:46:57,947
-gets 20 lashes to keep him awake.
-Yes, sir.

673
00:47:05,929 --> 00:47:08,021
Stay awake, men. Stay awake.

674
00:47:08,097 --> 00:47:10,394
They'll attack the moment you fall asleep.

675
00:47:10,465 --> 00:47:13,195
Stay awake. Come along there. Wake up.

676
00:47:23,241 --> 00:47:24,867
Wake up there. Wake up.

677
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:27,804
Sorry, sir.

678
00:47:29,879 --> 00:47:32,711
-That's all right, lad, just stay awake.
-Yes, sir.

679
00:47:34,748 --> 00:47:36,147
Two hour shifts today.

680
00:47:36,217 --> 00:47:37,706
-How's Jim?
-He's all right. Let's keep going.

681
00:47:37,784 --> 00:47:39,684
Come on. Two hour shifts today.

682
00:47:40,085 --> 00:47:43,451
We need more powder and ball.
l've got 50 kegs at the tavern.

683
00:47:43,855 --> 00:47:46,380
-Take 20 horses, men, and go get them.
-Aye.

684
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,600
Good morning, lass.
Did you have a good night last night?

685
00:48:03,668 --> 00:48:05,829
You men do it well, tormenting a girl.

686
00:48:05,904 --> 00:48:07,666
-You must be born with the gift.
-Now, now, lassie.

687
00:48:07,738 --> 00:48:10,797
Jim Smith and the magistrate's
put you here for your own safety.

688
00:48:10,874 --> 00:48:12,432
The powder is through there, lads.

689
00:48:12,509 --> 00:48:15,807
-Mac, is a fight on?
-Aye, a grand fight.

690
00:48:16,245 --> 00:48:18,144
l killed 20 of 'em me self.

691
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:20,340
A great pity you can't scalp them.

692
00:48:20,413 --> 00:48:22,677
lt's no civilized to scalp white men.

693
00:48:23,849 --> 00:48:26,840
Put some vigor in it, lads.
Jim Smith's waiting.

694
00:48:27,118 --> 00:48:28,415
Jim Smith.

695
00:48:29,888 --> 00:48:31,354
Put those kegs down.

696
00:48:32,089 --> 00:48:35,114
Are ye crazy?
We're running short of ammunition.

697
00:48:35,191 --> 00:48:37,158
Tell Jim Smith to get it somewhere else.

698
00:48:37,225 --> 00:48:39,523
This is my powder and it stays here.
Now, put them down.

699
00:48:39,594 --> 00:48:43,029
Just as things were going our way.
You'll be run out of the valley.

700
00:48:43,097 --> 00:48:45,587
Well, maybe l will,
but l'll be here long enough to see that,

701
00:48:45,665 --> 00:48:47,791
that white lndian hanging from a gallows.

702
00:48:47,866 --> 00:48:50,493
Now, now, lassie,
that's no way to be talking of a man

703
00:48:50,568 --> 00:48:53,196
who's half dead from a soldier's bullet.

704
00:48:54,604 --> 00:48:56,799
-Oh, no, Mac, no.
-Aye, Janie, aye.

705
00:48:57,006 --> 00:48:59,531
lt'll be a miracle if he lasts out the day.

706
00:48:59,675 --> 00:49:02,472
lf you've let him be killed,
l'll shoot the lot of you,

707
00:49:02,544 --> 00:49:04,135
every last man of you.

708
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:09,471
Heave ho, me lads, heave ho.

709
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:13,708
Jim !

710
00:49:17,086 --> 00:49:19,452
-Where's Jim?
-Right there, by the fire.

711
00:49:21,023 --> 00:49:22,081
Jim !

712
00:49:23,492 --> 00:49:26,358
Darling, darling, darling.

713
00:49:27,627 --> 00:49:29,117
How did you get out?

714
00:49:29,796 --> 00:49:31,956
Do you think anything would keep me?

715
00:49:32,198 --> 00:49:34,028
Do you think l'd let you die alone?

716
00:49:34,098 --> 00:49:36,623
Die? Who said l was going to die?

717
00:49:37,401 --> 00:49:38,868
Mac said so.

718
00:49:38,936 --> 00:49:42,803
Oh, it's only in the shoulder,
but if you're really set, l might die...

719
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:49,898
You wouldn't be doing that
if l wasn't just a little bit helpless.

720
00:49:49,977 --> 00:49:51,409
Now, what kind of a fool would l be,

721
00:49:51,477 --> 00:49:54,172
if l didn't take advantage
of my opportunities?

722
00:49:55,581 --> 00:49:57,411
Let's look at that.

723
00:49:58,983 --> 00:50:00,779
Go away.

724
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:12,714
lf he's a bit warm,
it's that kissing business, not the bullet.

725
00:50:22,766 --> 00:50:26,826
A white flag! Hold your fire. A white flag!

726
00:50:26,903 --> 00:50:29,132
Jim, Jim. The white flag.

727
00:50:39,111 --> 00:50:41,044
First we want the trade goods.

728
00:50:41,112 --> 00:50:44,376
Second, he and his men
are to get out of the valley.

729
00:50:44,448 --> 00:50:46,643
We asked for them here,
now we don't want them. They're to git.

730
00:50:46,717 --> 00:50:47,705
Yes, sir.

731
00:50:49,318 --> 00:50:51,182
And they may keep their weapons.

732
00:51:24,807 --> 00:51:26,172
They agreed, Jim.

733
00:51:27,776 --> 00:51:29,471
Heads up, lads. Heads up.

734
00:51:29,611 --> 00:51:31,601
Show this rabble our heads are up.

735
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:32,976
Open the gates.

736
00:51:33,481 --> 00:51:36,108
-Give the order to march, Sergeant.
-Yes, sir.

737
00:51:38,417 --> 00:51:41,647
Squads right, march!

738
00:51:41,819 --> 00:51:44,616
Forward, march!

739
00:52:30,887 --> 00:52:32,411
Captain Swanson.

740
00:52:32,488 --> 00:52:34,682
Company, halt.

741
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:37,584
Jim Smith would like words with you.

742
00:52:44,263 --> 00:52:45,992
The goods are in the fort.

743
00:52:46,465 --> 00:52:48,989
There's one thing
we want you to understand.

744
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,293
We're law-abiding men.

745
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:53,503
There is one thing l do understand.

746
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,662
You're a lot of blasted traitors.

747
00:53:09,881 --> 00:53:13,077
We whipped him !
We whipped the saucy peacock.

748
00:53:13,918 --> 00:53:15,282
l claim his scalp.

749
00:53:16,085 --> 00:53:17,642
ln the name of the law,

750
00:53:17,719 --> 00:53:22,052
l'll lift his scalp from his eyebrows
to his shoulder blades!

751
00:53:24,324 --> 00:53:25,552
Mac!

752
00:53:27,993 --> 00:53:31,291
Let me at him.
He's worse than the black lndian devil.

753
00:53:32,597 --> 00:53:34,496
ln the name of the law.

754
00:53:35,132 --> 00:53:38,999
Law-abiding men, loyal subjects.

755
00:53:39,468 --> 00:53:43,130
Drunken rabble you are, but l'll be back!

756
00:53:43,505 --> 00:53:45,768
l'll be back and you'll pay for this!

757
00:53:48,675 --> 00:53:49,937
Forward march.

758
00:53:50,743 --> 00:53:52,903
-Forward...
-Forward.

759
00:53:52,978 --> 00:53:54,104
...march!

760
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,394
Stop where you are, Callendar.

761
00:54:17,962 --> 00:54:19,395
We're free to go with Swanson.

762
00:54:19,463 --> 00:54:22,260
You'll go with Swanson later.
Get back to the fort.

763
00:54:53,187 --> 00:54:57,486
Listen, men, wait a minute.
l'm just a driver.

764
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:59,919
l didn't have anything to do
with the goods.

765
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:09,422
Thank you.

766
00:55:17,738 --> 00:55:19,102
Jim better this morning?

767
00:55:19,171 --> 00:55:21,229
He thinks he is, but he's not.

768
00:55:22,007 --> 00:55:23,531
l say we stay and fight.

769
00:55:23,608 --> 00:55:25,598
We've whipped them once,
and we'll whip them again.

770
00:55:25,676 --> 00:55:27,234
Fight 200 regulars?

771
00:55:27,611 --> 00:55:29,544
They'll probably come with cannon.

772
00:55:29,612 --> 00:55:33,809
Magistrate Morris, load a wagon full
of the trade goods.

773
00:55:34,615 --> 00:55:37,015
Take it to General Gage in Philadelphia.

774
00:55:38,018 --> 00:55:40,009
M'Cammon knows the south hills.

775
00:55:40,887 --> 00:55:42,945
You'll avoid the troops that way.

776
00:55:43,022 --> 00:55:44,921
But that might take several weeks.

777
00:55:44,989 --> 00:55:47,423
The rest of us can hide in Martin's Rock.

778
00:55:47,492 --> 00:55:51,086
They're 10 miles away, Jim.
That cock-sparrow Swanson is with them.

779
00:55:51,161 --> 00:55:52,627
We'd better get started.

780
00:55:52,695 --> 00:55:54,628
Then we'll have to tie you
on your horse, Jim.

781
00:55:54,696 --> 00:55:57,960
He can't hide in a cave. He'll die.
l won't let him go.

782
00:55:58,032 --> 00:55:59,863
He's going to see Dr. Stoke.

783
00:56:00,834 --> 00:56:03,324
Back to the tavern, girl.
Back to the tavern.

784
00:56:03,403 --> 00:56:05,927
Let men go about
the work they've got to do.

785
00:56:07,806 --> 00:56:11,206
Easy, lad, let us do most of the work.

786
00:56:17,546 --> 00:56:19,479
When you get to Philadelphia,

787
00:56:19,947 --> 00:56:22,710
speak to no one
but General Gage or Governor Penn.

788
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,273
And God go with you.

789
00:56:32,189 --> 00:56:34,180
Come on, men, put some backbone into it.

790
00:56:34,258 --> 00:56:37,920
Give me your foot. Put your arm
around my shoulders. Careful!

791
00:56:37,993 --> 00:56:40,985
-Put him in the cart, men.
-Janie.

792
00:56:41,595 --> 00:56:43,426
-Put that gun down.
-l won't.

793
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:46,428
l'm not going to be a widow
before l'm even a wife.

794
00:56:46,499 --> 00:56:49,365
l forbid you to use such talk
before all these men.

795
00:56:49,601 --> 00:56:51,659
lt's no becoming to a female McDougall.

796
00:56:51,736 --> 00:56:54,500
Do you think l care
what's becoming and what's not?

797
00:56:54,572 --> 00:56:57,768
He'll die and just because he wants
to be a big, brave, loyal chief.

798
00:56:57,841 --> 00:56:59,239
He won't leave his men.

799
00:56:59,308 --> 00:57:01,571
Well, his men can go hang for all of me.

800
00:57:01,643 --> 00:57:05,339
He's going to see Dr. Stoke,
if l have to kill you and him to do it!

801
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,775
Well, there's something
in what the lass says.

802
00:57:07,848 --> 00:57:09,405
She's a hysterical, arrogant shrew,

803
00:57:09,482 --> 00:57:10,847
and shouldn't be trusted
with a lethal weapon.

804
00:57:10,917 --> 00:57:12,508
Take it away from her.

805
00:57:16,487 --> 00:57:19,182
Now, now, lassie,
calm yourself, calm yourself.

806
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:24,688
You wouldn't shoot your loving father,
would you?

807
00:57:25,993 --> 00:57:29,428
The last male member
of the fine line of the MacDougalls.

808
00:57:31,464 --> 00:57:34,729
One more step, Mac,
and the fine line is finished.

809
00:57:38,802 --> 00:57:41,565
Wait, Janie,
Dr. Stoke is 15 miles from here.

810
00:57:41,704 --> 00:57:43,365
l can take him through.

811
00:57:43,773 --> 00:57:47,173
What else do you think l want with him
but to see him alive and safe?

812
00:57:47,242 --> 00:57:49,709
Why do you treat me like a witless child?

813
00:57:49,977 --> 00:57:51,171
Put him in the wagon.

814
00:57:51,245 --> 00:57:54,509
-Put me astride.
-No, Jim, the lass is right.

815
00:57:54,581 --> 00:57:55,877
She'll get you through.

816
00:57:55,948 --> 00:57:58,507
You're being twisted about
by a comely face.

817
00:57:58,583 --> 00:58:00,050
She loves you, Jim.

818
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:05,309
Are we to be the victims
of a girl's springtime fancy?

819
00:58:06,555 --> 00:58:08,317
-l'm going with you.
-And me.

820
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:11,620
You'd do best, Mac,
to stay far away from Jim for a while.

821
00:58:12,226 --> 00:58:14,558
l'm sorry, Janie, terribly sorry.

822
00:58:15,962 --> 00:58:20,193
Rum and lndian fighting makes a poor
mixture for the father of a young lassie.

823
00:58:20,432 --> 00:58:25,197
lf l had it to do all over, Mac,
l'd pick you again.

824
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:56,889
''Whereas l have received information
that sundry persons have,

825
00:58:56,991 --> 00:59:00,255
''at several times,
assembled themselves in armed bodies,

826
00:59:00,727 --> 00:59:03,661
''and have in a most riotous
and illegal manner

827
00:59:03,729 --> 00:59:06,993
''presumed to interrupt
the passage of supplies to the fort,

828
00:59:07,432 --> 00:59:10,889
''l do hereby require
all His Majesty's subjects

829
00:59:10,967 --> 00:59:14,060
''to give such evidence
as to apprehend all persons

830
00:59:14,203 --> 00:59:16,602
''concerned in the leading of these riots

831
00:59:17,105 --> 00:59:20,801
''so that the offenders
may be prosecuted according to law.

832
00:59:21,341 --> 00:59:22,807
''Signed, John Penn.''

833
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:25,408
God save the King.

834
00:59:26,711 --> 00:59:28,439
Disperse them and get on with it.

835
00:59:31,582 --> 00:59:32,980
Next prisoner.

836
00:59:37,419 --> 00:59:40,046
Driving his cattle into the swamp
and refused to billet.

837
00:59:40,121 --> 00:59:42,054
lsn't he one of the scum that whipped me?

838
00:59:42,122 --> 00:59:43,282
lt looks like him.

839
00:59:43,356 --> 00:59:44,823
Put him in irons.

840
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:49,156
Turn them over.

841
00:59:52,696 --> 00:59:55,528
-Another one.
-All right, stand in line. Stand up.

842
00:59:55,965 --> 00:59:57,796
Put his leg irons on first.

843
00:59:58,301 --> 01:00:00,359
Heave ho, here we go.

844
01:00:00,969 --> 01:00:02,492
All right, get the other one.

845
01:00:04,472 --> 01:00:07,201
Stay on your feet!
All right, stand over there.

846
01:00:07,373 --> 01:00:08,600
Come over there.

847
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:27,950
Prepared to talk, gentlemen?

848
01:00:37,194 --> 01:00:38,820
l want James Smith.

849
01:00:39,529 --> 01:00:42,429
The man that tells me where he is,
wins full pardon.

850
01:00:48,002 --> 01:00:49,059
lf you'd serve your King

851
01:00:49,135 --> 01:00:51,626
with one-tenth the loyalty you serve
that treasonable dog Smith,

852
01:00:51,705 --> 01:00:52,932
you wouldn't be in jail this moment!

853
01:01:01,011 --> 01:01:04,343
Jim, Jim Smith! Jim !

854
01:01:04,714 --> 01:01:05,737
He's not here.

855
01:01:05,814 --> 01:01:07,645
l know he's here, Janie.
l've got to see him.

856
01:01:07,716 --> 01:01:11,082
-He's not here. ls he, Doctor?
-No, he's not here.

857
01:01:11,552 --> 01:01:14,247
-Jim, Jim Smith, it's Anderson.
-Shut up, you blasted...

858
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,685
-Will Anderson! Will Anderson!
-He's not here, l tell you.

859
01:01:16,755 --> 01:01:18,881
-Shut up!
-You looking for me, Will?

860
01:01:19,524 --> 01:01:23,152
Jim, they've got half the valley in irons.
No warrants, no trials.

861
01:01:23,293 --> 01:01:25,385
Just a trader's word and you're in chains.

862
01:01:25,461 --> 01:01:28,487
They're even paying off men
that ain't had nothing to do with it.

863
01:01:28,564 --> 01:01:31,157
You just don't have to like them
to find yourself accused and convicted

864
01:01:31,232 --> 01:01:33,324
of riot, arson and armed robbery.

865
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:34,928
l'll be right down.

866
01:01:41,139 --> 01:01:43,572
Dr. Stoke said
you're not well enough to go.

867
01:01:43,641 --> 01:01:45,040
lt's finally come.

868
01:01:45,608 --> 01:01:48,702
l knew it would,
and now's as good a time as any.

869
01:01:48,777 --> 01:01:52,371
lt's been so pleasant here, Jim.
l sometimes even thought that...

870
01:01:52,446 --> 01:01:53,913
They think more of money
than they do of men.

871
01:01:53,981 --> 01:01:56,141
l said, l sometimes thought
that you thought...

872
01:01:56,216 --> 01:01:58,116
No more trading with lndians.

873
01:02:01,453 --> 01:02:04,182
Jim, Jim, please don't go.

874
01:02:04,255 --> 01:02:07,246
Don't let me have to stay behind
and die inside of me.

875
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:09,958
Troops sit in forts and the settlers die.

876
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:13,757
Let us get up to save ourselves,
and they move fast enough.

877
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:16,419
All right, go ahead.

878
01:02:16,597 --> 01:02:19,997
Go ahead, l don't care!
Get shot or hung from a scaffold!

879
01:02:20,066 --> 01:02:22,465
We've obeyed the law, they've broken it.

880
01:02:23,101 --> 01:02:25,830
You've always torn and twisted
the heart out of me.

881
01:02:25,903 --> 01:02:27,564
l've loved you from the first minute
l can remember,

882
01:02:27,638 --> 01:02:29,332
and you've brought me
nothing but misery.

883
01:02:29,406 --> 01:02:32,533
Well, l didn't expect much more,
so l asked for nothing,

884
01:02:32,641 --> 01:02:34,666
and l'm not asking for much now.

885
01:02:44,884 --> 01:02:49,182
You fool. You cruel, merciless fool.

886
01:03:10,134 --> 01:03:12,328
Come, magistrate, join the fun.

887
01:03:15,005 --> 01:03:16,198
What are you men going to do?

888
01:03:16,272 --> 01:03:19,570
We are going to stand the red coats
on their thick heads.

889
01:03:20,976 --> 01:03:23,341
Your stomach's
got to be right to take a whore.

890
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:08,438
They've gone to report to the fort.

891
01:04:09,275 --> 01:04:11,539
We'll give them a half-hour start.

892
01:04:13,178 --> 01:04:15,009
They are all drunk at McDougall's,

893
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:17,013
bragging that they are
going to take the fort.

894
01:04:17,081 --> 01:04:18,708
McGlashan, take a squad
and bring those men here.

895
01:04:18,783 --> 01:04:19,806
Yes, sir.

896
01:04:19,883 --> 01:04:22,181
Nine men are going to take the fort.

897
01:04:23,486 --> 01:04:26,352
And nine drunks are going to take the fort.

898
01:04:57,343 --> 01:05:00,038
The garrison's all asleep. The gate's open.

899
01:05:00,345 --> 01:05:02,938
There are only three sentries
on the wall, this side.

900
01:05:03,013 --> 01:05:05,947
The guard's away
across the parade ground, by the kitchen.

901
01:05:06,015 --> 01:05:08,006
They're getting the morning rum ration.

902
01:05:08,084 --> 01:05:09,812
lt's grand rum.

903
01:05:09,885 --> 01:05:12,115
l could almost taste the smell of it.

904
01:05:12,187 --> 01:05:14,120
The guns are stacked together,

905
01:05:14,755 --> 01:05:17,222
full 40 paces nearer to the gate
than what they are.

906
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:20,520
All right, when we run,
run crouched in the mist.

907
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,747
Put down those muskets.

908
01:06:05,825 --> 01:06:07,849
Come on down and join the party.

909
01:06:11,395 --> 01:06:14,329
Calhoon, stand at the barracks door
and keep them inside.

910
01:06:14,397 --> 01:06:16,557
Shoot the first one that shows his head.

911
01:06:16,631 --> 01:06:17,996
Find your commandant.

912
01:06:18,066 --> 01:06:20,590
Tell him if there's one move,
l'll blow daylight through these men.

913
01:06:20,668 --> 01:06:21,760
Yes, sir.

914
01:06:21,836 --> 01:06:24,395
Mac, open the guardhouse.
Get those prisoners out here.

915
01:06:24,471 --> 01:06:26,961
Will, get the flints out of those muskets.

916
01:06:28,674 --> 01:06:32,165
Now, Corporal,
find your blacksmith and fetch him here.

917
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:33,401
Yes, sir.

918
01:06:34,578 --> 01:06:36,374
All right, lads, all right.

919
01:07:01,597 --> 01:07:03,359
That's the last one, Mac.

920
01:07:08,034 --> 01:07:11,764
Let me do for him, Jim !
Let me do for him once and for all!

921
01:07:13,638 --> 01:07:16,129
Why not add murder
to your traitorous acts?

922
01:07:20,977 --> 01:07:24,844
You'll never learn, will you?
You'll never learn to know us.

923
01:07:26,047 --> 01:07:29,140
Take him to his quarters.
We'll give him back his fort.

924
01:07:29,216 --> 01:07:30,204
That's a mistake, Jim.

925
01:07:30,717 --> 01:07:32,708
l said we'll give it back.

926
01:07:35,554 --> 01:07:38,113
All right, men,
you can return to your homes.

927
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:40,679
And leave those muskets here.

928
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:44,459
Nine men.

929
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,327
Only nine men.

930
01:07:47,796 --> 01:07:48,956
Nine men.

931
01:07:52,199 --> 01:07:53,665
Nine men!

932
01:08:07,843 --> 01:08:10,037
You'd best give up. We've got you now.

933
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:11,908
One move and you're dead men.

934
01:08:11,979 --> 01:08:13,912
The boldness of the swine.

935
01:08:24,621 --> 01:08:25,747
He's dead.

936
01:08:26,389 --> 01:08:29,755
Now we have got you, Smith.
You've murdered him.

937
01:08:29,991 --> 01:08:31,583
We'll see you hanged for that.

938
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:33,786
You killed him. My shot went wild.

939
01:08:35,029 --> 01:08:37,588
You fired and he fell. That's murder.

940
01:08:42,734 --> 01:08:43,927
So that's it.

941
01:08:48,038 --> 01:08:51,302
Tie him to a horse.
We'll take him to jail in Carlisle.

942
01:08:56,044 --> 01:08:58,307
Get the stiff one.
We'll bring him along, too.

943
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:37,463
What shall l do? They'll tear the jail down.

944
01:09:37,572 --> 01:09:40,472
Well, can't you reason with them?
You're the jailer.

945
01:09:44,043 --> 01:09:46,375
But it's a mob. Can't you do something?

946
01:09:46,446 --> 01:09:50,005
Well, l can talk to them,
but they aren't going to like these.

947
01:09:51,616 --> 01:09:55,016
Briggs, Briggs, come here.
Bring your chisel. Take these irons off.

948
01:09:55,085 --> 01:09:58,315
l've got a wife and children.
Please, tell them l'm on your side.

949
01:09:58,387 --> 01:10:00,877
Here, Briggs, here, here. Right over here.

950
01:10:23,171 --> 01:10:24,296
Hi, Jim, hi.

951
01:10:24,372 --> 01:10:26,203
Just hang on. We'll get you out.

952
01:10:26,274 --> 01:10:29,367
Mac, much obliged to you and the boys,

953
01:10:29,876 --> 01:10:32,070
but it'd look bad if l ran away.

954
01:10:32,278 --> 01:10:34,302
lt'd look like l was guilty.

955
01:10:34,445 --> 01:10:36,674
Best way you can help me is to break up.

956
01:10:36,747 --> 01:10:39,716
They're planning to take you back
to the fort and court-martial you.

957
01:10:39,783 --> 01:10:41,147
They want you out of the way.

958
01:10:41,217 --> 01:10:44,014
We've done everything
according to law up to now.

959
01:10:44,352 --> 01:10:45,341
Make way.

960
01:10:45,987 --> 01:10:49,922
Law? What law?
This kind of law, the law of bayonets?

961
01:10:51,824 --> 01:10:55,782
l say burn the jail down.
Burn it down around their ears!

962
01:10:55,861 --> 01:10:56,952
Aye!

963
01:11:01,197 --> 01:11:03,392
Men! Men!

964
01:11:03,465 --> 01:11:06,628
l'll talk for Jim Smith.
l know what he thinks.

965
01:11:06,834 --> 01:11:09,962
He doesn't want anybody to get fired on
by the soldiers.

966
01:11:10,103 --> 01:11:11,968
But if any of us were in there,

967
01:11:12,039 --> 01:11:15,132
he'd go in and get us,
soldiers or no soldiers!

968
01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:20,468
Janie, hold your tongue.

969
01:11:23,047 --> 01:11:25,514
Tell them, Professor, tell them for me.

970
01:11:28,183 --> 01:11:31,413
Men, we've fought and won,

971
01:11:32,586 --> 01:11:34,849
but in winning we've lost something.

972
01:11:35,522 --> 01:11:39,958
ln defending one law,
we've come to despise all law!

973
01:11:40,425 --> 01:11:42,552
And if you go on like this,

974
01:11:42,627 --> 01:11:45,959
we'll destroy the very thing we fight for!

975
01:11:47,263 --> 01:11:48,628
Men, disband.

976
01:11:48,998 --> 01:11:51,124
Go home and let me stand my trial.

977
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:58,995
-Bring in the accused.
-Yes, sir.

978
01:12:01,873 --> 01:12:03,465
Bring in the prisoner.

979
01:12:10,579 --> 01:12:12,843
You may remove that barbarian
from the courtroom.

980
01:12:12,915 --> 01:12:14,745
-He's a witness.
-Remove him.

981
01:12:16,884 --> 01:12:17,941
Step out, you.

982
01:12:18,018 --> 01:12:20,508
Now, laddie, l was only clearing my throat.

983
01:12:21,687 --> 01:12:25,178
lt's the right of every free-born Scotsman
to clear his throat if he's a mind to.

984
01:12:25,256 --> 01:12:29,954
l clear mine a wee bit noisily perhaps.
Now, do not push. Do not push, laddie.

985
01:12:30,626 --> 01:12:31,957
Any lout who feels the need

986
01:12:32,028 --> 01:12:34,791
of airing his spleen
at the expense of the Court's decorum

987
01:12:34,863 --> 01:12:37,387
will find himself
dining on bread and water.

988
01:12:37,698 --> 01:12:38,687
Proceed.

989
01:12:44,436 --> 01:12:47,893
-You're sure he's the same man?
-He made no pretense about it.

990
01:12:48,406 --> 01:12:51,704
His attitude throughout was a contempt
for authority. He was openly seditious.

991
01:12:51,775 --> 01:12:54,834
l object. The defendant is on trial
for murder, not for treason.

992
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:57,434
lt is our intention to establish
a connection between the two.

993
01:12:57,512 --> 01:13:00,810
He fired on His Majesty's troops,
destroyed army supplies,

994
01:13:01,248 --> 01:13:03,182
interfered with the King's messengers,

995
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:05,979
released prisoners
held by us for court-martial.

996
01:13:08,854 --> 01:13:10,445
The pack-train leader.

997
01:13:12,423 --> 01:13:13,787
Ralph Callendar!

998
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:17,483
Raise your right hand.

999
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:21,852
Do you swear or affirm that the evidence
you shall give in the case now in hearing

1000
01:13:21,929 --> 01:13:25,056
shall be the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1001
01:13:25,132 --> 01:13:26,190
l do.

1002
01:13:27,366 --> 01:13:31,165
Did you hear Tom Calhoon offer to turn
King's evidence against James Smith?

1003
01:13:31,236 --> 01:13:32,294
l did, sir.

1004
01:13:33,104 --> 01:13:37,163
When Tom Calhoon said he was going
to Philadelphia to swear to the Governor

1005
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:40,266
about Jim Smith's treason,
Jim Smith shot him dead.

1006
01:13:40,876 --> 01:13:45,437
l tried to stop him but Jim fired that shot
so sudden and unexpected.

1007
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,743
And he was Tom Calhoon's best friend.

1008
01:13:50,749 --> 01:13:51,977
Your witness.

1009
01:13:53,152 --> 01:13:55,415
Can you identify this, Mr. Callendar?

1010
01:13:58,755 --> 01:14:02,190
That there is the shirt that Tom Calhoon
was wearing when Jim Smith killed him.

1011
01:14:02,258 --> 01:14:03,986
There's the bullet hole.

1012
01:14:05,794 --> 01:14:07,624
Can you identify this?

1013
01:14:08,762 --> 01:14:11,229
That looks like the gun he shot him with.

1014
01:14:11,597 --> 01:14:12,962
Now, how far would you say

1015
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:16,057
Jim Smith was standing
from Tom Calhoon,

1016
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:18,096
when you say he shot him?

1017
01:14:18,869 --> 01:14:20,029
About four feet.

1018
01:14:20,104 --> 01:14:22,799
He just put the gun up against him
and shot him.

1019
01:14:22,872 --> 01:14:23,997
About that?

1020
01:14:24,139 --> 01:14:27,801
You're certain of all else you saw,
why aren't you certain of this?

1021
01:14:28,709 --> 01:14:31,074
That's how far it was, l'm certain.

1022
01:14:33,447 --> 01:14:34,413
May l have the Court's permission

1023
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:35,879
to make an experiment?

1024
01:14:35,948 --> 01:14:37,210
An experiment?

1025
01:14:38,183 --> 01:14:40,742
l should have thought the facts were
sufficiently plain to speak for themselves.

1026
01:14:40,818 --> 01:14:43,616
Well, why try my client at all? Why
not just hang him and be done with it?

1027
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:46,211
Oh, all right, proceed with the experiment.

1028
01:15:00,599 --> 01:15:01,963
All right, Janie.

1029
01:15:15,109 --> 01:15:17,100
ls that young person loading that weapon?

1030
01:15:17,177 --> 01:15:20,543
That young person is a dead shot.
There's no cause for alarm.

1031
01:15:20,646 --> 01:15:24,045
l shall be personally responsible
for any acts committed here.

1032
01:15:24,515 --> 01:15:25,812
Get on with it.

1033
01:15:36,724 --> 01:15:39,385
This is decidedly irregular and smelly.

1034
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:42,289
How many more of these detonations
are we to endure?

1035
01:15:42,361 --> 01:15:43,487
Just one.

1036
01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:09,471
You will note the shot fired at 20 paces
carries a clean hole.

1037
01:16:10,248 --> 01:16:14,115
That fired at six inches
is deeply studded with powder burns.

1038
01:16:16,285 --> 01:16:18,309
You will also notice, gentlemen,

1039
01:16:18,753 --> 01:16:21,016
that the shirt Tom Calhoon wore

1040
01:16:21,155 --> 01:16:24,521
carries a clean hole
with no evidences of a burn.

1041
01:16:25,158 --> 01:16:28,388
Gentlemen, that shot was fired
by some other in the crowd,

1042
01:16:28,527 --> 01:16:31,518
someone else standing many paces away.

1043
01:16:32,062 --> 01:16:33,188
Order, order.

1044
01:16:33,264 --> 01:16:35,458
Will you permit a scoundrel to go free?

1045
01:16:35,532 --> 01:16:38,932
A scoundrel who leads treason
and sedition and defies England?

1046
01:16:39,101 --> 01:16:42,035
ls there to be a stench in this courtroom
that will linger for centuries?

1047
01:16:42,937 --> 01:16:44,029
l protest.

1048
01:16:44,138 --> 01:16:47,004
-The man is innocent of the crime.
-You are under arrest,

1049
01:16:47,073 --> 01:16:49,370
for revealing your decision
before a majority vote.

1050
01:16:49,441 --> 01:16:50,806
Captain Swanson.

1051
01:16:54,311 --> 01:16:55,505
Captain Holmes,

1052
01:16:55,579 --> 01:16:58,741
place Mr. Poole, Ralph Callendar
and the drivers under arrest

1053
01:16:58,814 --> 01:17:00,372
for breaking the King's proclamation

1054
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,712
and transporting illegal trade-goods.

1055
01:17:03,618 --> 01:17:05,881
Captain Swanson,
you'll retire to your quarters.

1056
01:17:05,953 --> 01:17:07,647
-l'll talk to you there.
-Yes, sir.

1057
01:17:24,599 --> 01:17:26,066
l am a soldier, sir.

1058
01:17:26,167 --> 01:17:28,464
They could have been carrying
the murderer of my own father,

1059
01:17:28,535 --> 01:17:30,366
if they'd had a permit for it.

1060
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:31,903
l would have defended him with my life.

1061
01:17:31,971 --> 01:17:33,871
There is such a thing
as understanding, Captain.

1062
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:35,736
-Yes but...
-l know, l know.

1063
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:39,400
We haven't taught soldiers
to soften themselves at understanding.

1064
01:17:40,044 --> 01:17:41,943
We'll probably suffer for it.

1065
01:17:42,045 --> 01:17:44,638
Well, l've ordered the release
of Jim Smith.

1066
01:17:45,814 --> 01:17:49,442
And l'm sorry, Captain Swanson,
but l must relieve you of your command.

1067
01:17:49,984 --> 01:17:53,146
You'll report to Philadelphia
and prepare to leave for England.

1068
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:54,346
Yes, sir.

1069
01:18:05,728 --> 01:18:07,854
-Goodbye, Jim.
-Bye, Jim.

1070
01:18:07,929 --> 01:18:09,226
-Bye, Jim.
-Bye.

1071
01:18:09,297 --> 01:18:11,026
Sure you don't want to go, Mac?

1072
01:18:11,099 --> 01:18:14,533
Those Tennessee hills are big,
wild and away from the crowd.

1073
01:18:14,968 --> 01:18:16,663
There'll be you and me

1074
01:18:17,303 --> 01:18:19,167
and Professor and our surveyor friend.

1075
01:18:19,238 --> 01:18:21,432
Mac, are you thinking of leaving me?

1076
01:18:28,877 --> 01:18:31,344
This is your home, Jim.
You'll be back, l know.

1077
01:18:31,412 --> 01:18:33,505
Make it soon lad. We'll miss you.

1078
01:18:33,581 --> 01:18:34,877
Thank you, sir.

1079
01:18:39,752 --> 01:18:44,120
Well, Janie,
even the worst of enemies must part.

1080
01:18:44,955 --> 01:18:46,479
Don't forget us, Jim.

1081
01:18:46,991 --> 01:18:49,686
Don't ever forget us.
Not for one small minute.

1082
01:18:50,226 --> 01:18:53,126
-Now, lass.
-l'll do my own talking.

1083
01:18:55,963 --> 01:18:58,123
There's so much for a man to do

1084
01:18:58,398 --> 01:19:02,128
that there's no time for, well, other things.

1085
01:19:02,735 --> 01:19:04,225
But if there was time,

1086
01:19:04,503 --> 01:19:07,369
l mean, if l was inclined,

1087
01:19:08,405 --> 01:19:09,463

1088
01:19:11,641 --> 01:19:13,632
lt wouldn't be any other woman.

1089
01:19:14,243 --> 01:19:15,470
Only you.

1090
01:19:22,815 --> 01:19:24,180
-Bye, boys.
-Bye, lad.

1091
01:19:34,291 --> 01:19:36,952
Janie, where are you going?

1092
01:19:38,226 --> 01:19:39,750
With my man.

1093
01:19:43,397 --> 01:19:45,455
You've the skirling blood of the...

1094
01:19:46,332 --> 01:19:50,597
