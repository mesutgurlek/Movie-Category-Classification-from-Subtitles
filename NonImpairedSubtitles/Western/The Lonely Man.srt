1
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,093
It's Willie.

2
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:41,666
I need a drink.

3
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:53,979
Well?

4
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,981
I got bad news, King.

5
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,915
Jacob Wade's pulled out.

6
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,248
He left Monolith last Monday.

7
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,946
Where did he go?

8
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:02,147
That's just it, King.

9
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,418
He, he lit out from under.

10
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,515
You lost him?

11
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,492
I left you to keep
a mark on him.

12
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:10,920
You'll kill him!

13
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,361
You find Jacob or I will.

14
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:13,365
Do you hear me?

15
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,299
Find him, or I'll kill you
in his place!

16
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,748
A man'd go loco

17
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,816
working on a bullet like that
all the time.

18
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,452
Would you forget it

19
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,827
if a man had put
this piece of lead

20
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,798
a half-inch from your heart?

21
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,700
I'm gonna send this back
where it came from:

22
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,328
To Jacob Wade.

23
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,605
Give me three.

24
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,479
Three for the dealer.

25
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,796
Hello, Jacob.

26
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,104
Been a lot of years
since you stepped foot

27
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,633
in this part of the country.

28
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:32,804
Yeah.

29
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:37,077
Heard about you
from time to time.

30
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,777
How you been, Bryant?

31
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,616
Can't kick.

32
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:45,647
Got yourself a big reputation
since you left Bridelow.

33
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,957
Yeah.

34
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,395
Big, but not good.

35
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,161
Well, it don't scare us none,
Jacob,

36
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,101
so, you got any business
in this town,

37
00:03:57,136 --> 00:04:00,162
you see it's finished
by tomorrow noon.

38
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,842
I'm looking for Riley.

39
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,905
You come to the right place.

40
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,658
You looking for something?

41
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:32,762
Can I buy you a drink?

42
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:36,138
Oh, anybody can buy me a drink.

43
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,562
Well, who are you?

44
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:58,894
I'm your father.

45
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,597
Where's your mother, Riley?

46
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,941
Where's your mother?

47
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,572
Don't you know?

48
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,449
Well, come on, I'll show you.

49
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,814
She's down there someplace.

50
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,780
People say she jumped.

51
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,788
I say you pushed her.

52
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,021
When, Riley?

53
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,087
Five years now.

54
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:44,525
A killer's wife
doesn't have friends.

55
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,561
The women walked around her,

56
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,131
the men were afraid
to talk to her.

57
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,543
She stood it
as long as she could.

58
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,480
I wish it was you down there,
instead of her.

59
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:03,516
I guess you do.

60
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,843
How do you make your living?

61
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:37,845
Well, uh... I count money
at the bank.

62
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,459
What do you do
for a living, Riley?

63
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,156
Nothing.

64
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,690
I get along.

65
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,606
It's yours.

66
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,551
What's that,
your cut of the Fargo job

67
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:43,919
or the mail train massacre?

68
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,322
Get this place fixed up.

69
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,919
Get it working again.

70
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,225
I wouldn't touch
your blood money

71
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,698
no more'n this town'd touch me.

72
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,724
Maybe you...

73
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,699
maybe you'd better not
stay here.

74
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,907
Maybe you'd better come with me.

75
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,775
I'd sooner go with the devil.

76
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,117
What brought you
back here, anyway?

77
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:19,887
Your conscience been
bothering you?

78
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,291
Just don't come back
after 14 years of killing

79
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,886
without there being some reason.

80
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:27,091
You're my son.

81
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,658
I wanted to see you
before it was too late.

82
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:30,760
Help you.

83
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:33,738
The way you
"helped" my mother?

84
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,298
Maybe I'm thinking of her,

85
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,367
the way she would've
wanted you to turn out.

86
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,904
That's good.

87
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,678
Now you're thinking of her.

88
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,421
Well, I want you

89
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:52,720
to keep thinking
of her all the time.

90
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:56,455
I don't want you
to ever forget her...

91
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,986
or what you did to her.

92
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,267
I look like her, don't I?

93
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:11,238
All right, Jacob Wade...

94
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,644
I'll go with you.

95
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,308
I want to, so you'll
keep on remembering

96
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,784
what makes you ache,

97
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,810
so that every time
you look at me,

98
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:24,482
you'll remember that
you killed my mother.

99
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,650
Get your gear.

100
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,661
My gear.

101
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,404
I got all I want.

102
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,562
All right, Lon,
what did you see?

103
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:49,597
Guess you shot the
fella: Three times.

104
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,977
That's where you're wrong.

105
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,105
He only shot him twice.

106
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,672
I shot him the first time.

107
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,981
I don't get it.

108
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,453
The idea is the hand's
quicker than the eye.

109
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:07,255
Like slipping a cold deck
into a poker game.

110
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,920
Now, take that
baldheaded eagle

111
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,258
that just grabbed
that rabbit over there.

112
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,457
You see him?

113
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,125
What baldheaded eag?

114
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,894
Like that.

115
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,838
They'll all be watching me
while Faro guns him down.

116
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,438
Up against a cold deck.

117
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:25,910
I'm a gambler, Lon.

118
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,345
A gambler's got to have an edge.

119
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,941
It might still be dangerous
trying to kill Jacob Wade.

120
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,851
Now matter how s...
smart we figure it.

121
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,946
You think so?

122
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,165
That's him.

123
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,241
Where are you going?

124
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,276
Feed myself.

125
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,312
Man feeds his horse first.

126
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,825
Well, I guess I got
a lot to learn...

127
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,089
not from you.

128
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,442
What can I do for ye?

129
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,779
Feed 'em and cool 'em
for the night.

130
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,852
I'll handle this.

131
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,621
Is that livin' quarters
back there?

132
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,894
There's a kitchen and a bed.

133
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,902
But not better than
my horse stalls.

134
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,699
How many horses you own?

135
00:13:58,737 --> 00:13:59,795
I count nine.

136
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,965
Wagons to go with 'em?

137
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,007
Six of 'em out back,

138
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:07,604
includin' the wedding surrey,
with wheels o' red.

139
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,204
Do your own shoein'?

140
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:12,911
That were my first trade,
blacksmithing.

141
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,852
You be a man
what knows my business.

142
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,549
Well...

143
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,088
...you thinkin' of
selling out maybe?

144
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:27,030
I been workin' this stable
more'n ten years now.

145
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:31,332
I'm hopin' to go on working it
for the same.

146
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,463
I'll make it a good price.

147
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,267
And I'd have
but one answer for ye:

148
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,572
How good, mister?

149
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,842
Three thousand?

150
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,212
Fair enough.

151
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,585
In gold?

152
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,589
Yeah.

153
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,783
Stay right where you are.

154
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,382
Keep your hands
where we can see 'em.

155
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:58,487
It's not often we're honored
by such famous company.

156
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,054
Are you Jacob Wade?

157
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,697
Take his gun, Matt.

158
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,431
We don't want
any trouble here.

159
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,699
Just get out of town.

160
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,173
Wasn't aimin'
to make trouble, mister.

161
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,436
Judge. Judge Hart.

162
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,774
I administer the law
in this region.

163
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:13,903
He wants to buy my place.

164
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,480
Offered good money for it, too.

165
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,448
He's not welcome here,
Mr. McGregor.

166
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,210
What happened, Sheriff?

167
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,622
He wouldn't move fast enough
when I came after him.

168
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,388
He wanted to finish
his grub first.

169
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,520
Where I come from,
a sheriff wears a badge.

170
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:33,087
And you gun monkeys use 'em
for target practice.

171
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,123
You're in bad company, son.

172
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,431
You've got to expect
rough treatment.

173
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:39,061
Get their horses, Mr. McGregor.

174
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,696
Get movin'.

175
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,904
There, Wade.

176
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,908
Take it and shake the dust.

177
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,603
Pick it up.

178
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,619
Pass the word along
to Blackburn, Ryerson,

179
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,249
and the rest of your friends:

180
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,919
Keep out of Bonneville.

181
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,224
We don't want
any gunfighters here.

182
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,593
We'll fight 'em, ten to one

183
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,029
and shoot 'em in the back.

184
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,532
So, if they know
what's good for 'em,

185
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:42,534
they'll stay away.

186
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,661
Now, get along.

187
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,914
Got any more ideas?

188
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:10,188
I said I'd find you a place.

189
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,356
I didn't say it'd be easy.

190
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:16,526
Another town, maybe.

191
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:19,002
It might be better.

192
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,006
It might be worse.

193
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,099
Yeah...

194
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:27,870
it might be.

195
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,989
Cold?

196
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,212
Get up. You're sick.

197
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,917
I have to get you under cover.

198
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,491
Come on.

199
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:48,584
Get up.

200
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,118
Where are you taking me?

201
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:54,929
I know a place.

202
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,334
They'll just kick us out,
like all the others did.

203
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,364
Not this place.

204
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,447
Jacob!

205
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:51,581
Hello, Ada.

206
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,239
Open the door.

207
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,657
Who's he?

208
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,793
He's my son.

209
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:08,833
He'll be better by tomorrow.

210
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,335
I never knew you had a son.

211
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,497
Come to think of it,
I never really knew too much...

212
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,199
Ada...

213
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:23,176
I didn't mean to come back
and start things over again,

214
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:26,946
only... there was no other
place to take the boy.

215
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,486
This is your house, Jacob,
all of it.

216
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,354
No, I gave it to you, Ada.

217
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:36,521
I'd just like for us
to stay awhile.

218
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,529
Where's his mother?

219
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,630
She's dead.

220
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,137
He isn't easy to get along with.

221
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:47,661
He hates everyone.

222
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:52,702
I can't say I blame him.

223
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,871
You knew she was dead
when you left?

224
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,972
No.

225
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,812
That's the reason
you couldn't marry me...

226
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,046
'cause you thought
you had a wife.

227
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:08,490
I never expected
to come back here, Ada.

228
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:09,892
It doesn't matter.

229
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,089
You're here now.

230
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:19,336
I never realized how much you...

231
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,931
you were part of this house.

232
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,237
It's just nothing without you.

233
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,301
It's just... empty, Jacob.

234
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,972
Don't make too much of it.

235
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,942
When I saw you coming,
I was so glad.

236
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,609
It's no use, Ada.

237
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:37,713
I came back because I had to.

238
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:52,694
That's the way you looked
the first time I saw you,

239
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,968
sitting in King's place alone,

240
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:58,270
staring at the bottom
of a whiskey glass.

241
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,107
What's so terrible about the way

242
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,613
people look into empty
whiskey glasses? I...

243
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:04,547
Oh, Jacob, don't you understand?

244
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,210
This is your home!

245
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,780
I got to make a place for him.

246
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:15,281
I'll help you do it.

247
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:22,094
Jacob, you've come home again.

248
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,599
Hold your fire, Jacob.

249
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:33,702
A man can get killed coming
through a door like that.

250
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,649
Didn't expect to find you here.

251
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:42,448
Ben rode in yesterday.

252
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:43,818
Do a beat old waddy a favor

253
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,288
and get me a cup of coffee?

254
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,324
Good to see you, Jacob.

255
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,101
What are you doing
in Monolith?

256
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:01,867
Mmm, ain't it a place
to like?

257
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,842
A man gets tired of
being run out of towns,

258
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,844
and I remembered
this spread of yourn.

259
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,743
I was hunting wild horses
with Jacob

260
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,340
the first time he ever
laid eyes on this place.

261
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:14,910
I was going to ask Ben
to run the ranch for me.

262
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,614
Well, thank you, ma'am.

263
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,850
Thank you very kindly.

264
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,120
I'll just take a nibble.

265
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:25,125
You hiding out, Ben?

266
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:26,926
I been law-abidin' and peaceable

267
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,932
ever since you
broke up the bunch.

268
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,026
Where's Blackburn?

269
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,435
I hear him and the boys
is hidin' out

270
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,565
along the upper Platte
somewhere.

271
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:36,574
I'm through triggerin'.

272
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,905
You know that, don't you, Ben?

273
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,070
Sure, Jacob.

274
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:41,942
You quit outlawin'
to settle down

275
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,572
and break wild horses.

276
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:45,105
I could do with a few myself.

277
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,846
You break a good, strong,
wild one, you can run away

278
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,717
from any posse horse
in the county.

279
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,587
There'll be no running away
from posses in this county.

280
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,592
Mm, naturally,

281
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,856
you bein' a peaceable man
nowadays.

282
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,855
You're lyin', Ben.

283
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,808
You never could fool him none.

284
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,470
The fact is,
I got in a little trouble

285
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,309
and needed a place to hide.

286
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,474
I'm up at Yankee Draw with
the sheriff out this way,

287
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,915
and he's an old friend
of Jacob's.

288
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,417
That won't buy
any special favors.

289
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,420
He leaves us alone
if we leave him alone.

290
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,445
I don't aim to tangle
with the law no more.

291
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,252
Gettin' too old for that.

292
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:37,424
You ought to take more rest,
Riley.

293
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,300
I'll get you some warm food.

294
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:40,304
Don't bother.

295
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,430
I won't be here that long.

296
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,839
Why, you're Jacob's boy,
ain't you?

297
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,776
I knowed it the minute
I laid eyes on you.

298
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,540
You weren't no more
than that high

299
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,571
when old Ben Ryerson
lived next door to you.

300
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:51,707
Knows your ma, too.

301
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,580
She's dead, Ben.

302
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:53,379
That's too bad.

303
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,113
Right pretty woman,
your ma was.

304
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,451
'Course, she was always
a little strict for my taste.

305
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:58,854
I like a woman who laughs a lot.

306
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,879
Shut up!

307
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,895
You mention my mother
in this house again

308
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,125
and I'll kill you.

309
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,115
Jacob?

310
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:13,926
I'm sorry, I thought
it was your father.

311
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:24,131
Does Jacob know you're going?

312
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:27,542
I'll leave it to you
to tell him.

313
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:40,085
It's me you're running
away from, isn't it?

314
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,491
That's right, it's you.

315
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,893
You wouldn't put up with
any woman your father liked.

316
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:49,264
Women like you?

317
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,494
Maybe you'd better go.

318
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:53,163
You might learn the truth
and stop hating your father.

319
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:54,398
That wouldn't do.

320
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:57,602
You'd have to stop feeling
sorry for yourself.

321
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,270
Only one person
I ever felt sorry for.

322
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,672
Not your kind.

323
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:10,548
What do you know
about my "kind"?

324
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:17,083
Go on, run.

325
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:18,755
It's better for Jacob.

326
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:24,094
I wouldn't want to do anything
that was better for Jacob.

327
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,671
Maybe I will stay awhile.

328
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,029
Who's that? Willie?

329
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,330
It's your brother.

330
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:09,740
Well, it's about time
you got here.

331
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,305
Didn't I tell you
to keep off your feet?

332
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,010
Yeah, sure, you told me.

333
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:17,079
When's this thing
gonna stop achin'?

334
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,680
When you give it
a chance to heal.

335
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:21,214
Sit down, King.

336
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,318
You've got to keep quiet
for a couple of weeks.

337
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:26,330
I've been quiet for six months.

338
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:28,662
A man who hates
the way you do

339
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,894
makes him evil.

340
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,731
Look, I didn't get you
down here for preachin'.

341
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,737
I'm your brother.

342
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,830
I've got to try
to make you see things.

343
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,398
Yeah, sure, sure.
You've tried that before, too.

344
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,605
Yes, King, I've tried.

345
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:43,773
You were always were
a fancy talker...

346
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:47,444
only I always get in
the last word.

347
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,693
You hear that, Faro?

348
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,561
The doc says
I've got to be quiet.

349
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,138
Let me tell you somethin':

350
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:10,107
If Willie was to come
through that door right now,

351
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,938
I'd be out of here in a minute.

352
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:14,511
How long am I supposed
to wait for Willie?!

353
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,139
What about Jacob's girl?

354
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:22,313
Maybe she knows where he is.

355
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:24,150
She ain't Jacob's girl.

356
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:29,184
Don't hurt yourself, King!

357
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:35,154
Ada ain't anybody's girl, Lon.

358
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,667
You want to remember that.

359
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:57,080
This is Echo Canyon.

360
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,954
Best wild horse country
in the territory:

361
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:06,829
Good water, plenty of grass,
and no cowboys riding by.

362
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:12,235
You'll find, oh, maybe
70, 80 mustangs in these hills,

363
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,033
any day you look.

364
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:15,699
A man could make a good living

365
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,537
just catching and breaking 'em.

366
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:18,769
Look!

367
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,975
I'd sure like to throw
a saddle on him.

368
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,289
He's like...
he's like a white cloud.

369
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:36,725
Think he'd lead us to his herd?

370
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:39,025
No, he's too smart for that.

371
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,795
Let's run him into the ground.

372
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:45,132
You ride after him first.

373
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:49,469
When your horse gets tired,
you head him back this way,

374
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,441
and Ben'll go after him.

375
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,671
Well, you show me how.

376
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,838
I'll start him out.

377
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,421
Go, boy!

378
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,706
I'll take him now.

379
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:16,279
Anybody else would be honored

380
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,811
to have Jacob
show him the ropes.

381
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:21,347
I'm not anybody else.

382
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,485
Yeah, you're special.

383
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,964
You know,
I was just thinking...

384
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:05,901
you're not Jacob's age.

385
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,494
You're more my age.

386
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,074
I'm a thousand years older
than you.

387
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:18,008
I'll bet you've learned
a lot, too.

388
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,921
Let me tell you something.

389
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,457
Jacob is a man.

390
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,984
That's something you're not.

391
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,930
Suppose you teach me.

392
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,932
Peter!

393
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,935
Jacob'll be waitin' for us!

394
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:41,164
He's almost got him penned!

395
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,564
I can get him now.

396
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:12,995
Thanks for the lesson.

397
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:19,096
You'll learn one
before the day's over.

398
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:20,569
You'll learn we don't quit.

399
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:21,731
Jacob, look!

400
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,103
The bay!

401
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:26,774
Let's get 'em.

402
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:39,945
Hold him!

403
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,253
We'll start busting 'em
tomorrow.

404
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:22,928
Give us a chance to see
if you can sit a wild one.

405
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,468
You all right?

406
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:07,793
Now you mount him.

407
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:11,834
Oh...

408
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:14,276
you like it so much,
you stick with it.

409
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:15,505
Not me.

410
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:21,511
Riley!

411
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:38,291
I'll break you like I'd break
any other wild horse.

412
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,996
I'll break you or kill you.

413
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,404
You want to run away,
I can't stop you,

414
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,672
but if you stay here,
I'll make a man of you.

415
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,407
You talk pretty big,
especially about running away.

416
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,302
You hurt, Jacob?

417
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,172
Get me some water.

418
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,985
Here's your water.

419
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:53,104
What's happening?

420
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:55,543
It's the bronc; he shook me up.

421
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,009
It's more than that, isn't it?

422
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:03,753
You walked into that chair

423
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:06,585
as if it wasn't there,
as if you didn't even...

424
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:07,784
see it.

425
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,816
Things just blurred
for a minute, that's all.

426
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,965
What's wrong with your eyes,
Jacob?

427
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,531
Nothing.

428
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:23,938
There's nothing wrong with them.

429
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,601
You're keeping something
from me.

430
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:27,941
Oh, it's happened before.

431
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:28,945
It'll go away.

432
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:29,946
How long now, Jacob?

433
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,277
What difference does it make?

434
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:32,282
We'll find help.

435
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:33,374
We'll get a doctor.

436
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:34,679
I saw a doctor. He...

437
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:39,179
Is that why you went away,
Jacob?

438
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:42,815
Don't you think
I'd want to know and help you?

439
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:45,955
Nobody can help me.

440
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:48,328
Will it get worse?

441
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:52,332
I don't know.

442
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:01,971
I have to do something
for that boy while I can.

443
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:04,242
He hates you.

444
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:05,908
He's part of me.

445
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,248
Hate, no pity.

446
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,513
I don't ask for pity.

447
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:10,577
Maybe if he knew.

448
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:11,815
No!

449
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:18,925
If he wants to hate me, let him.

450
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:20,123
What I'm trying to do

451
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:21,961
is to stand him
on his own two feet.

452
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:34,975
Don't tell him anything.

453
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:48,322
Is that the last one?

454
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:51,958
Not enough mustangs

455
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:54,965
to pack canvas
into Echo Canyon now.

456
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,796
Mm, look good, too.

457
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,936
We go for the herd
dawn tomorrow.

458
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:27,294
Oh, no more.

459
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,298
Time to get movin'.

460
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:39,135
Riley...

461
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:42,304
we'd best go out
and saddle up the horses.

462
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,184
Hello, Jacob.

463
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,592
Hello, Ben.

464
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,090
I'm Blackburn, ma'am.

465
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:04,623
Me and Jacob's
been friends a long time.

466
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:07,398
The lady's not interested
in your life history, Blackburn.

467
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:11,238
Well, maybe
we're interested in her.

468
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:13,243
Lean off, Bode.

469
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:15,575
We're guests here.

470
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:17,102
Heard you were around, Jacob.

471
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:19,342
Thought we'd drop in
for a little visit.

472
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:22,244
Right friendly of you.

473
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:26,017
It's got its business side, too.

474
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:29,150
You settin' 'em up, Jacob?

475
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:38,758
We need horses, Jacob.

476
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:41,937
Posse after you?

477
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:43,599
Not yet.

478
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,835
I told you I quit.

479
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:50,280
Told you that some time ago.

480
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:51,781
Them dogs we got,

481
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:54,283
we couldn't outrun
a Shetland pony.

482
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:57,287
Got a right smart saddle band
out in the corral, Jacob.

483
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:58,288
Tell you what.

484
00:45:58,322 --> 00:45:59,619
You let us use 'em,

485
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:02,124
we'll give you
a share of the clout.

486
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,259
What clout?

487
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:09,231
Why, there's a bale of gold
up at the Golden Nugget Mine...

488
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,756
Shut up!

489
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,799
Clarence never could keep
his tongue still.

490
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:19,999
Them horses got my brand on 'em.

491
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:23,376
That mine's less than
20 miles from here.

492
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:25,381
Makes it real handy.

493
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:30,819
This is the only place left
where I can live peaceable.

494
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,488
I got my son with me now,
and I aim to do it.

495
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,794
I need them horses, Jacob.

496
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,323
I wouldn't try to take 'em.

497
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:48,471
I took orders from you
for a long time.

498
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:51,269
I give the orders now.

499
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,572
There's six of us.

500
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,240
Ben come up ahead of us.

501
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:04,415
I hate to tangle
with an old friend

502
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:06,046
but this is business.

503
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:09,382
I got this 'un covered, Black.

504
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:10,984
That's good thinkin', Bode.

505
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,461
If Jacob draws on me

506
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:15,522
you put a bullet
right in that kid's head.

507
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:19,429
There ain't nothing
to worry about, ma'am...

508
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:21,460
not 'less'n Jacob
wants trouble.

509
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,299
Well, how 'bout it, Jacob?

510
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,900
You want him whole?

511
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:36,650
All right, Bode,

512
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,348
bring him out.

513
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:10,212
Don't try to stop 'em.

514
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:12,586
I got to...

515
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:14,420
or we'll never take root again.

516
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:15,755
Jacob...

517
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:17,453
I can't let them run us out.

518
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:18,586
They'll kill him!

519
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:36,679
I said I'd find him a home.

520
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,930
I meant what I said, Blackburn.

521
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:01,971
No horses.

522
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:09,005
I guess you don't value
your kid over a mustang.

523
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:10,980
Get off that horse.

524
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:28,054
Okay, boys.

525
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:33,968
No sense in looking for trouble.

526
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,616
Take your dead and git.

527
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:50,245
Don't bury them on my ground.

528
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:19,742
He had to kill 'em, didn't he?

529
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:27,274
You hear a lot of things
about your father.

530
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:31,879
It isn't the way
you thought it would be, is it?

531
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:39,792
Did you think he liked
using a gun?

532
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:43,527
It wouldn't have happened
if he'd led a decent life.

533
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:46,468
He's always been decent to me.

534
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:53,199
You had that same look
on your face

535
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:55,473
the first time you saw me.

536
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:56,740
I guess I did.

537
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,270
The first time I saw you

538
00:51:58,315 --> 00:52:00,476
you were living
in Jacob's house.

539
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:02,178
You're still living there.

540
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:04,915
Yeah, and we met
in a gambling hall,

541
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:07,751
and he shot a man
on account of me.

542
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,783
Well, I'll bet he did.

543
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:16,862
Uh, what were you doing
in a gambling hall,

544
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,336
teaching Sunday school?

545
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:25,171
Looking to make my fortune,
like my pa before me.

546
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,608
He was King Fisher's
piano player.

547
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,509
When he died, I took over.

548
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:32,606
Do you know how
we made our fortune?

549
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:36,085
With coins they throw
on a saloon floor.

550
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,814
King thought he owned me

551
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:40,379
because I worked in
a gambling hall.

552
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:42,823
He found out how wrong he was.

553
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:45,794
Why, because you
liked Jacob better?

554
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:48,059
Yeah.

555
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:52,831
From the first time I saw him,

556
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:55,201
sitting alone in the Bonanza...

557
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:59,231
staring into an empty glass.

558
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:14,617
Do I need a drink.

559
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:17,422
Where is it?

560
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,796
I hope you earned
that drink, Willie.

561
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,630
He's back in Monolith.

562
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:27,296
I had a hunch he would be.

563
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:28,929
He's living at Ada's.

564
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:29,939
Just the two of them?

565
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:31,268
They got some kid with him

566
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:32,468
and Ben Ryerson.

567
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:33,908
Saddle the horses.

568
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:07,636
We'll stake out the canvas
along this line.

569
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:17,503
Benato's here.

570
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,748
You and Ben stay here.

571
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:27,518
I'll circle around behind
and head 'em back this way.

572
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:30,287
You hear 'em coming,
shimmy 'em down the middle.

573
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,454
Ada, get your horse
and come with me.

574
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,710
You workin'
or lookin'?

575
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,481
Thinkin' of cutting out Jacob?

576
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:06,455
Guess you could get
back at him that way.

577
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,166
You're just like your ma,
ain't ya?

578
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:25,479
I been waitin' for this.

579
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:54,676
Hyah! Hyah!

580
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:20,062
You should have
known better, Ben.

581
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:26,493
We get back to the ranch,
you pack up your things

582
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:28,504
and get out.

583
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:14,712
Ben?

584
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,815
Can I ask you a question
before you go?

585
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:33,298
There's something I got to know.

586
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:42,600
Why did Jacob leave Red Bluff?

587
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:50,509
Well, he killed the sheriff.

588
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:52,578
You kill a badge-man
in this country,

589
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:53,919
they'll hang you quick.

590
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:56,517
Look, why would a man
married to a woman like my ma

591
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:57,617
kill anyone?

592
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:02,297
Because she was a woman
like your ma.

593
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:07,492
All right? Now you're
going to hear it.

594
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,103
There was a drought.

595
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,131
Big outfits fenced
off the water,

596
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:14,768
leaving our cattle to die.

597
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:17,905
We had to cut the fences...

598
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,278
or move on.

599
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:20,976
You know what your ma said?

600
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:23,816
Now, you listen to me.

601
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:26,947
She "wasn't moving
nowhere," Ruth said.

602
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,821
She wasn't leaving our house

603
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:32,624
and comforts... your fine ma.

604
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:34,562
So, Jacob and I drove our herds

605
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:36,895
down to the creek
and cut the fences.

606
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:39,231
Then somebody started
shooting at us.

607
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:40,496
We shot back.

608
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:42,629
Well, he could have come back
for my ma, couldn't he?

609
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:44,401
That's exactly what he did do.

610
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:48,342
Only they shouldn't have
named your ma "Ruth."

611
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:52,644
She only read that part
of the Bible where it says

612
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:54,582
"Thou shalt not kill."

613
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:56,983
She never read where it says

614
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:59,179
"Where you go, I'll go."

615
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:01,952
I don't believe you.

616
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:04,391
Jacob begged your ma
to go with him!

617
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:09,329
Things had've been so different

618
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:10,957
if only your ma
had come with him.

619
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:15,369
Three times
he went back for her.

620
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:17,669
And three times she said, "no."

621
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:19,971
You're a... a liar.

622
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:24,536
Man calls me a liar,
I'll kill him.

623
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:30,752
You're not a man.

624
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:34,112
You're a boy.

625
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:46,801
Ben...

626
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:54,273
Where you going to go?

627
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:00,476
Don't rightly know.

628
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:07,683
Can't go back to Red Bluff,
that's for sure.

629
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,419
Can't go back with Blackburn.

630
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:10,926
He's dead.

631
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,866
Guess I just ain't going
nowhere.

632
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:16,947
Rider coming.

633
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:24,692
It looks like Ben Ryerson.

634
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:27,321
Faro.

635
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:41,442
Thought you was dead, King.

636
01:04:41,477 --> 01:04:44,173
You guessed wrong.

637
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:46,943
Pick the wrong card,
you lose, don't you?

638
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:50,375
You're about as stinking wrong

639
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:52,580
as that pig friend of yours,
Jacob Wade.

640
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,955
You wouldn't let anybody
talk like that

641
01:04:57,994 --> 01:05:00,724
about your friends,
would you, Lon?

642
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:01,991
Sure wouldn't.

643
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:06,626
You're in my way, Ryerson.

644
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:18,275
Worked fine.

645
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:21,010
Willie, when we get to town,

646
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:24,178
have somebody tell the sheriff
there's a dead man out here.

647
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:26,450
That'll get Yankee
out of the way.

648
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:28,286
All right, let's get on.

649
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,949
He wouldn't leave like this,
Jacob.

650
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:02,855
Not without saying anything.

651
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:04,120
Then where is he?

652
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:07,084
I don't know.

653
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:09,529
I'll tell you where he is.

654
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,532
He's running...

655
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:14,832
'cause he never had it in him
to do anything else.

656
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:16,269
He's no good, Ada.

657
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:17,602
You're wrong.

658
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,665
I did everything I could
for him. Now I'm through.

659
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:21,904
"Everything you could for him"?

660
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:23,035
Starting when?

661
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:25,513
He's had a bad time of it,
Jacob.

662
01:06:25,548 --> 01:06:27,812
Maybe he doesn't do things
the way you'd like him to.

663
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:29,181
Maybe he's trying and he can't.

664
01:06:29,218 --> 01:06:30,913
He's proud, just like you.

665
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:33,683
That's why I know
he isn't running away,

666
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:36,521
because he is just like you.

667
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:41,195
Where are you going?

668
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:43,824
To look for him.

669
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,441
Riley!

670
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:02,075
Pull up!

671
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,397
He came out of Echo Canyon.

672
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:26,698
Riley!

673
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:29,610
Go up that way.

674
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:44,451
Riley!

675
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:47,826
Riley!

676
01:08:27,236 --> 01:08:28,328
Riley!

677
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:33,737
Riley!

678
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:51,490
Riley! Riley!

679
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,930
Oh, Riley...

680
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:40,238
Well, I got him.

681
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:42,437
You're a fool.

682
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:46,075
Maybe I was.

683
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:54,555
Ben told me about my mother
before he left...

684
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:55,989
things I didn't know.

685
01:09:57,893 --> 01:10:00,225
Well, you have to understand
about her, she...

686
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:04,532
...she wasn't strong enough
for pioneering.

687
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:05,534
She tried.

688
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:07,763
But she never tried
to forgive you.

689
01:10:07,803 --> 01:10:12,797
Well, now... forgiving
didn't come easy to her.

690
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:15,036
You see, she...

691
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:24,441
Pa?

692
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:35,859
It wasn't you who killed
that sheriff, was it?

693
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,490
It was Ben.

694
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:43,570
It was me killed the sheriff.

695
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:47,033
I killed a lot of men.

696
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,665
Hello, fella.

697
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:14,601
Come over here.

698
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:22,435
Proud of him, aren't you?

699
01:11:22,478 --> 01:11:24,946
Yeah.

700
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:27,107
Took a lot of courage.

701
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:32,743
I got a...

702
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:35,655
I got a funny kind
of a feeling in my bones today.

703
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:44,157
The first time in a lot of years
I feel hopeful.

704
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:46,599
Of course you do.

705
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:48,466
Maybe there's a chance
for us yet.

706
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:29,468
Just like old times, huh, Faro?

707
01:13:44,653 --> 01:13:45,984
King!

708
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,427
Go get her, Willie.

709
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:15,207
Hello, Ada.

710
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:17,343
Old friend of your'n in town.

711
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:19,854
Wants to see you.

712
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:36,435
Come here, Ada.

713
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,096
Sit down.

714
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:19,911
You look real natural,
setting there by the piano.

715
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:22,006
Why'd you come back?

716
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:24,018
I got old friends
in this town.

717
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:26,316
I'd kind of like
to see them again.

718
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:31,918
I was hoping you weren't
looking to make trouble.

719
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,019
No trouble for me.

720
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:36,826
Jacob doesn't want any, either.

721
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:42,095
Suppose he went away, King.

722
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:44,662
Suppose we left town.

723
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:46,936
You'd kind of like that,
wouldn't you?

724
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:50,068
You and him going away together.

725
01:15:53,682 --> 01:15:56,173
All right.

726
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:57,742
I won't go with him.

727
01:15:57,786 --> 01:16:00,619
I'll come back here
and play for you again.

728
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:02,487
Just like I used to.

729
01:16:08,997 --> 01:16:11,363
Just like it used to be, King.

730
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:15,200
The lights and the people
all talking at once.

731
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:17,637
Three-deep at the dice table.

732
01:16:19,141 --> 01:16:22,907
I still have my gowns, King.

733
01:16:22,945 --> 01:16:25,846
The red one,
remember the red one?

734
01:16:28,383 --> 01:16:31,352
Willie...

735
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:32,853
you tell him, Willie.

736
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:36,517
It's bad business to open
a place with a killing.

737
01:16:36,558 --> 01:16:39,652
People will stay away.
They'll be afraid.

738
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:45,395
Lon...

739
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:49,737
Faro?

740
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:51,568
We had a good thing
here once.

741
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:52,904
We could do it again.

742
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:53,930
You talk to him.

743
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:55,534
Tell him to be reasonable.

744
01:16:55,577 --> 01:16:56,805
He'll listen to you.

745
01:16:56,845 --> 01:16:58,403
It'll be just like old times.

746
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:03,941
The old times are gone, Ada.

747
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:09,480
You can tell Jacob I said so.

748
01:17:09,524 --> 01:17:11,355
Tell him I want to see him.

749
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:12,382
Please, King...

750
01:17:12,427 --> 01:17:13,894
Tell him Ben is dead.

751
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:31,506
That'll bring him.

752
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:34,909
Come on.

753
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:37,077
That-a-baby. Come on.

754
01:17:39,554 --> 01:17:41,818
Here, hey, come here.

755
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:44,223
Come here. Here, here.

756
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,933
Jacob!

757
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:56,297
Jacob!

758
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:09,741
What's wrong?

759
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:12,117
Ada?

760
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:13,883
King's back.

761
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:16,914
He and his men are just
sitting in his place waiting.

762
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:27,034
They killed Ben.

763
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:34,666
Jacob!

764
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,075
Listen to me.

765
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:37,908
We don't have to stay
in Monolith.

766
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:40,140
There are other places...
better places...

767
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:41,240
far away from here.

768
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:42,307
Not now.

769
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:43,908
You said we had a future.

770
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:45,613
Don't let King spoil that.

771
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:47,815
There's only one way
to stop him.

772
01:18:47,856 --> 01:18:51,883
We could leave now and
start a whole new life.

773
01:18:51,927 --> 01:18:53,952
No starting over for me.

774
01:18:58,033 --> 01:18:59,432
Jacob...

775
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:02,102
you're walking into a trap.

776
01:19:02,137 --> 01:19:03,604
There are four men there...

777
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:06,607
four men with good eyes
against one who can't see.

778
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:08,131
What chance will you have?

779
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:10,076
I'm going to try.

780
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:13,103
Don't I mean anything?

781
01:19:13,148 --> 01:19:15,378
Or Riley?

782
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:18,684
If I don't finish the job

783
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:21,450
they'll be hanging over us
the rest of our lives.

784
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:26,420
What do you mean, he can't see?

785
01:19:29,364 --> 01:19:30,991
He's going blind.

786
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:32,693
Stop him.

787
01:19:32,734 --> 01:19:34,759
Blind?

788
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:36,498
Why didn't you tell me?

789
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:40,406
Riley, if he goes to meet King,
he'll never come back.

790
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:51,753
Faro, get behind the bar.

791
01:19:59,694 --> 01:20:02,595
Open the cash drawer,
and put your gun in it.

792
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:06,089
Keep both hands on the bar top
where he can see them.

793
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:08,796
Willie, you tie back
those swinging doors.

794
01:20:08,837 --> 01:20:11,397
Lon, take the roulette table.

795
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:16,934
Faro, when he makes that lean,
gun him down.

796
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:05,692
He's coming.

797
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:08,622
Hello, Jacob.

798
01:22:10,525 --> 01:22:13,392
I heard you were looking for me.

799
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:15,521
Any special reason?

800
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:17,497
What would you think?

801
01:22:17,532 --> 01:22:20,160
Sitting here like I am,
still alive?

802
01:22:20,201 --> 01:22:22,931
I'd think I was lucky.

803
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:26,030
And I'd let it go at that.

804
01:22:29,878 --> 01:22:32,005
I'm a gambler, Jacob.

805
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:35,975
Always willing
to try my luck again.

806
01:22:38,253 --> 01:22:40,585
I told the boys you would come.

807
01:22:42,324 --> 01:22:44,554
It's like I said.

808
01:22:44,592 --> 01:22:47,390
Jacob plays
according to the rules.

809
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:49,693
Always ready
to give the other fella

810
01:22:49,731 --> 01:22:52,097
a chance to get back
what he's lost.

811
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:53,930
I'm no gambler.

812
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,960
That's where you're wrong,
Jacob.

813
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:58,505
You're staking your neck
on this game.

814
01:22:59,874 --> 01:23:01,671
Yeah.

815
01:23:05,246 --> 01:23:08,477
They come a long way
for nothing, King.

816
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:23,531
You've stacked your last deck.

817
01:23:37,145 --> 01:23:38,373
Behind you!

818
01:23:50,392 --> 01:23:51,586
Can't see him.

819
01:23:51,626 --> 01:23:53,787
Give me the gun.

820
01:24:41,376 --> 01:24:42,741
Was that King?

821
01:24:42,777 --> 01:24:43,903
Yeah.

822
01:24:43,945 --> 01:24:45,276
He's gone.

823
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:38,091
Where is he?

824
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:39,691
Where is he?

825
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:42,134
On the balcony.

826
01:25:45,773 --> 01:25:47,934
Which way fr...

827
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:49,910
from the tree?

828
01:25:49,944 --> 01:25:52,310
To the left.

829
01:25:52,347 --> 01:25:55,145
About ten feet.

830
01:25:56,718 --> 01:25:58,276
Lower!

831
01:26:13,902 --> 01:26:15,836
You got him.

832
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,178
Pa!
