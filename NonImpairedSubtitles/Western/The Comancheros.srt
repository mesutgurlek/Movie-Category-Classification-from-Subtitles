1
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,077
Since there is no reconciliation, we proceed.

2
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,436
You will please stand
with your backs to one another.

3
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,109
It may amuse you to know, monsieur,
I never believed you cheated at cards.

4
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,350
Maybe I don't have your sense of humour.

5
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,034
There's a lady who prefers
your attentions to mine.

6
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,554
I intend to simplify her choice.

7
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,835
Rachel?

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,717
Margot? No.

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,917
When I begin to count,
you will each take ten paces.

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,269
You will turn and fire on the count of ten.

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,238
If either man stops or turns
before the count is complete,

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,073
it will be my distasteful duty
to shoot him down.

13
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,798
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,836
One, two, three,

15
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,718
four, five, six, seven,

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,791
eight, nine, ten.

17
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,313
Fool. If he hadn't stepped aside,
I'd have hit him in the shoulder.

18
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,030
Many of us will be sorry to see you hang.

19
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,908
Hang? They've never enforced
the laws against duelling before.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,310
The son of Judge Beaubien
has never been killed before.

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,393
Most certainly he will have you arrested
and hanged before the week is out.

22
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,313
I'm sorry. It will take
the incentive out of duelling.

23
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,834
I wouldn't wanna
spoil it for the rest of you.

24
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,480
When one has proven himself
on the field of honour,

25
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,269
one cannot turn tail and run
like a common criminal, can one?

26
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,316
One can.

27
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,275
Paul Regret, cabin 39.

28
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,151
Well?

29
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,232
I sent you to do an errand, Amelung.

30
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,632
He's registered as Paul Regret,
cabin number 39. He has no luggage.

31
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,759
You could have met this handsome chap
without sending me to snoop out his name.

32
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,071
I think you just want to humiliate me.

33
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,958
I'll not need either of you until morning.

34
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,273
13, black, odd. No winner.

35
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,870
- 23, please.
- 23 it is.

36
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,394
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.

37
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,471
Place your bets, please.

38
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,876
Five outside.

39
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,793
Nine inside. The winner, nine.
Nobody there.

40
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,034
Place your bets, please.

41
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,477
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.

42
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,751
King outside.

43
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,558
Six inside. Winner six.
Guess it isn't your night, sir.

44
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,029
23, red and high. A winner!

45
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,513
Madame! Madame has won.

46
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,393
- Thank you.
- Pardon me, young lady.

47
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,439
But the one value of my white hair
is that I may address beautiful women

48
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,875
without being thought presumptuous.

49
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,315
Will you favour an old man with this waltz?

50
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,789
Thank you, but this dance is taken.

51
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,194
And here's the gentleman who has it.

52
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,909
Surely you remember
we have this dance, Mr Regret?

53
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,913
I have a poor memory,
but not for matters of utmost importance.

54
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,474
- Excuse us, sir.
- With envy, young man.

55
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,552
Thank you, Mr Regret.
You saved me from a dreary fate.

56
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,312
He is a darling, but I...

57
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,393
I am happy I was on the spot
when you found yourself in such difficulty.

58
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,710
How did you know my name?

59
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,349
That was fortunate.
I heard the head waiter address you.

60
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,236
I dare say the salon will be full of cigar smoke
and loud talk about the price of cotton.

61
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,231
Salons usually are at this hour.

62
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,232
<i>Too bad. I would like a glass of wine.</i>

63
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,915
May I suggest my cabin?

64
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,878
Frankly, I prefer my cabin.

65
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,839
Shall we say number 127 in half an hour?

66
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,349
It wasn't fair of me to come here.

67
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,392
- Fair?
- I'm not worth the effort.

68
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,835
I haven't been lucky at the tables.

69
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,911
What do you take me for?

70
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,555
A liar, to start with.
A beautiful liar, but a liar nevertheless.

71
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,757
No waiter has so far called me by my name.

72
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,196
I'm sorry, my dear.
But when the irate husband appears,

73
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,716
you'll find the contents
of my pocket not worth your trouble.

74
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,553
- You think me a blackmailer?
- Or whatever.

75
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,030
Whatever your game is,
the trophy is not worth the chase.

76
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,749
- Look at my hand, please.
- It's very graceful.

77
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,318
The smallest stone in that ring
could buy and sell you, Paul Regret.

78
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,391
Why should I want money from you?

79
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,109
Experience has taught me
to look carefully at a gift horse.

80
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,557
Am I to believe you weighed, appraised and
selected me out of all the men on the boat?

81
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,756
Do not be too conceited.

82
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,229
It's not a very large boat.

83
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,835
We certainly have picked
a wonderful evening to fall in love.

84
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,789
Don't be ordinary. What passes between
us tonight has nothing to do with love.

85
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,871
You don't believe that love exists?

86
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,431
I believe this very night, all over the world,
men and women are saying to each other

87
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,036
"I love you" when what
they really mean is "I desire you".

88
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,390
You are a very unusual woman.

89
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,630
It is unusual to be honest.

90
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,075
I like independent women,

91
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,755
but I also want the right
to be able to choose my own.

92
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,631
Mr Regret.

93
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,759
You like independent women
and I admire men who can't be bought.

94
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,630
I think we've misjudged each other.

95
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,109
It's three days to Galveston.

96
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,191
Shall we start again?

97
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,317
To the beginning.

98
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,911
Wh... What?

99
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,471
$300 for a suit of clothes.

100
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,880
Where I come from,
we could outfit 30 men for that.

101
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,554
- Who are you?
- The name's Cutter. Jake Cutter.

102
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,471
Cap'n Texas Rangers.

103
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,519
This tailor's gonna be mighty unhappy
when he don't get his money.

104
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,391
Course, he'll get a lot of advertising.
You wearing that $300 suit onto the gallows.

105
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,677
- You can't do this.
- Well, now, let's see.

106
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,830
This here says Monsewer Paul Regret.

107
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,832
- That's Mr Paul Regret in English, ain't it?
- Yes.

108
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,310
- You're under arrest.
- I've committed no crime in Texas.

109
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,994
Right. But you killed a man in Louisiana.

110
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,312
I'm taking you to the ranger headquarters
where a Louisiana marshal will pick you up,

111
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,233
take you back to New Orleans
and the gallows.

112
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,313
We're getting real obliging
to the states down here in Texas.

113
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,600
A lot of folks want to join the Union.

114
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,478
There's a couple of hundred
in gold in thatjacket.

115
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,438
Does that give you any ideas, friend?

116
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,512
I've got what you might consider a weakness.

117
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,475
I'm honest.
You start getting into that $300 suit.

118
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,551
And I ain't your friend.

119
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,956
Give me a minute to talk to someone.
It's very important. A girl.

120
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,758
Have a heart, friend.

121
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,991
I've been trying to explain
to you that I ain't your friend.

122
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,868
But I don't want anyone to accuse me
of not having a heart.

123
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,315
I'd like it if she didn't have to see these.

124
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,391
Hide 'em in that hat.

125
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,599
Oh, uh...

126
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,071
I wouldn't try any city-slicker stuff
on this poor old country boy.

127
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,149
- Well, she's gone.
- Anybody can see that.

128
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,639
She said it was for ever.

129
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,190
Looks like country boys
aren't the only ones who get lied to by gals.

130
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,636
I'll turn Galveston upside down. I'll find her.

131
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,075
You're sort of forgetting, Monsewer.

132
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,151
I got a prior claim.

133
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,031
Regret.

134
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,637
Monsewer Paul Regret.

135
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,631
- You say this trip'll take five days?
- Right. Step aboard.

136
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,551
- What, on this mule?
- On the mule.

137
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,359
- Riding him's gonna slow us down.
- Very sad.

138
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,560
But if you were to take off for the tall
and uncut, I could run you down real easy.

139
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,112
- How we gonna eat?
- Ever been out in the fresh air?

140
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,671
A side of bacon, beans,
a coffee pot and a frying pan?

141
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,639
- All the comforts of home.
- Yeah. All the comforts of home.

142
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,633
I'm beginning to hate this mule already.
He's got a mean look.

143
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,711
His name is Mabel.

144
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,711
Well, come on, Mabel.

145
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,671
Break out the coffee.

146
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,391
It's in your saddlebag.

147
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,914
Get it.

148
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,991
All right.

149
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,549
Unless you want this salt pork burned.

150
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,589
Captain Jake.

151
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,916
My friend, you're a very brave man.

152
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,555
And pretty soon you're gonna
catch on I ain't your friend.

153
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,591
Captain Jake.

154
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,675
It's getting very tiresome
lugging this saddle around.

155
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,514
I don't suppose you'd take my word
of honour that I won't try to escape?

156
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,751
Monsewer, you are a lulu.

157
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,873
<i>What do you find that's so interesting
about this miserable country?</i>

158
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,633
I used to own a cattle spread over there.

159
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,314
- You were a rancher?
- Yeah.

160
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,709
2,000 head of longhorn.

161
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,711
Indians run you out?

162
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,553
No. They weren't any trouble then.

163
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,870
Not till a few years ago.

164
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,916
Something's stirrin' them up now.

165
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,709
- The drought get you?
- My wife died.

166
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,358
Oh.

167
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,714
That's unfortunate.

168
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,713
So I gave the spread
to some right nice people.

169
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,474
Folks that used to work for me.

170
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,597
Well, I personally could never see marriage.

171
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,919
Seems like a fella'd always feel that curiosity
about the next woman he was going to meet.

172
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,720
Lots feel that way.

173
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,791
Did once myself.

174
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,391
Hold it.

175
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,311
That's an Indian sign.

176
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,197
You're gonna live a lot longer
if you follow after me. Ya!

177
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,712
I expect we'll find the little girl inside.

178
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,075
Did you know these people?

179
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,993
Rode many a night herd with all of 'em.

180
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,509
I was at the baby's christening.

181
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,318
I guess that's about all we can do for 'em.

182
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,391
I hate to do this...

183
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,629
Hey, Jake, that's a pretty
good-looking mount you got there.

184
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,711
<i>(laughter)</i>

185
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,558
Hi, Jake. You been horse-trading?

186
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,391
How come you're riding a mule?

187
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,710
Because I took to liking mules.
You got any objection?

188
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,439
- No, sir.
- Or you? Or you?

189
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,317
No, not me.

190
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,913
- Hello, Tobe. Major wanted to see me.
- He'll be right back.

191
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,991
Say, how do you spell "Louisiana"?

192
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,469
L-o-u-i...

193
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,996
- What do you wanna know for?
- I'm writing my pa a letter.

194
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,755
"Captain Jake went to pick up
a prisoner wanted by the state of Louisiana".

195
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,435
"He came back with a mule
and a split head and no prisoner".

196
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,398
I might have a "PS" for your pa.

197
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,474
"Dear Mulehead. We didn't beat this boy
enough when he was growing up".

198
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,799
- Major.
- Hi, Jake.

199
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,314
- I got a little surprise for you.
- Yeah?

200
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,518
Yeah. Something that may prove that theory
you've been bending our ears with.

201
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,558
- You mean a gang running the Comanches?
- Yeah.

202
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,200
Picked up a fella with a wagonload of guns.

203
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,271
Come on back here.

204
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,437
I'm sorry.

205
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,478
Between you and me,
I feel a sight better I was stopped.

206
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,473
Stopped before I went off and done
some fool thing I might be ashamed of.

207
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,553
Like them guns. Wouldn't be right
if they fell into the wrong hands.

208
00:21:18,795 --> 00:21:20,252
Might even got to the Comanches

209
00:21:20,352 --> 00:21:23,436
Now I look back on it,
I can see how bad it was.

210
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,636
That's how come that I give myself up.

211
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,316
Yup. After breaking one ranger's jaw and
slicing up two others with a bowie knife.

212
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,356
I feel bad about that.

213
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,431
I wasn't using my head.

214
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,592
You used everything else.
Feet, fists and teeth.

215
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,116
Yes, sir.
But them rangers sure won me over.

216
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,478
If I'd have knowed men like that, I might
never have fell in with bad companions.

217
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,996
Those are the fellas we wanna hear about,
those bad companions.

218
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,073
And it's my Christian duty
to tell you everything I know.

219
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,628
Which ain't nothin'.

220
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,076
Well, the truth is I ran into a man in Yuma.

221
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,958
He said I'd get the best price
for my guns in Sweetwater.

222
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,716
Said if I'd go down to Sweetwater,
check in a hotel, I'd be got in touch with.

223
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,112
But I never did find out who.
And that's the gospel truth.

224
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,794
You still don't know where
you got those guns.

225
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,917
I've been beatin' my head tryin' to remember.

226
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,639
If I could only find that bill o' sale.

227
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,030
Those guns were stolen from
the quartermaster depot on Fort Sill.

228
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,319
No! Well, then the man who sold 'em to me,
he must have been mixed up in it.

229
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,836
If I'd have knowed that,
I sure would have reported it.

230
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,835
I think he's telling the truth about one thing.
It's the first time he brought guns into Texas.

231
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,310
And the last. Bless you for believing me, sir.

232
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,789
I believe you because I know
where you spent the last five years.

233
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,997
- The Yuma Territorial Prison.
- Well, yes, sir.

234
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,470
But they had a right to lock me up.
I done a bad thing.

235
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,075
What with me not never having
no schooling and knowing no better.

236
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,709
But now I'm all straightened out.
I been saved by the law.

237
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,476
Maybe the Comanche contact man
won't know him by sight.

238
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:10,553
You want me to take his place? Take the guns
to Sweetwater and meet the contact man?

239
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,949
Hey, that ain't a bad idea.

240
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:18,068
And you're sure welcome to use
my name, sir. McBain. Ed McBain.

241
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,395
Maybe that'll make up some
for the way I almost disgraced it.

242
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,516
<i>Think of me being mixed up with them.</i>

243
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,956
Me, who ain't never been
in no trouble before.

244
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,794
- Well, not hardly.
- All right, McBain.

245
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,998
Just a minute. Might wanna
do a little readin' tonight.

246
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,992
Either one of you gentlemen
got an extra Bible?

247
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,872
Oh, sure, Mr McBain!
We been holding the room for ten days.

248
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,951
Never knew when you might be gettin' in.

249
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,793
- Reckon that'll cost me extra.
- Won't cost you nothin'.

250
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,552
- It's all been taken care of.
- Oh?

251
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,837
Yes, sir, Your friend says
to tell you your money ain't no good.

252
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,549
Says anything you want's on him.
It's one of the best rooms in the house.

253
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,155
Says to stay tight, spraddle out,
and you'll be got in touch with.

254
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,835
That's room 19.
That's right up on the first floor, sir.

255
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,551
That's right, sir.

256
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,036
- Am I in the right place?
- I guess so.

257
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,350
We were supposed to meet two gentlemen.

258
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,635
Well, ladies, you're halfway home.

259
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,597
Ed McBain at your service.

260
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,956
I'm Adabelle La Domergue
and this is my friend Guadalupe.

261
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,157
Guadalupe Felipa Carmela López de Reyes.

262
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,597
- Fuzzy for short.
- Well, it's delightful to meet you, Fuzzy.

263
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,399
- Who provided the refreshments?
- I really don't know.

264
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,233
They were already here
when we ladies arrived.

265
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,151
Well, a toast to him, anyway.

266
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,633
Mr McBain, I just want you to know that
we don't usually go out on blind dates but...

267
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,438
<i>(banging)</i>

268
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,238
Oh, no.

269
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,710
I... I'm afraid we have a previous engagement.

270
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,389
Last time we had the pleasure
of your company,

271
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,916
we was involved in four fistfights,
a stabbing and a shooting...

272
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,513
and all before midnight!

273
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,591
Yee-ha!

274
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,678
McBain, what'd you do with them guns?
I tore your wagon apart and I didn't find 'em.

275
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,876
I found a false bottom but no guns.

276
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,315
- You got 'em or ain't you got 'em?
- I buried 'em.

277
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,233
You what? What kind of
a sneakin' somethin' is that?

278
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,312
That is a damn distrustful way
to start off a deal.

279
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,316
I didn't want 'em to fall into the wrong hands.

280
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,918
Well, you got me there.
But you're dealing with the right party now.

281
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,031
The name's Tully Crow.

282
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,078
You ain't done thatjug much damage.
Mind if I help myself?

283
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,479
- Go ahead.
- Snuff?

284
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,551
Cigar man.

285
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,431
<i>(snorts)</i>

286
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,475
Buried them guns, huh?

287
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,393
That was smart. Real inspitorial.

288
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,313
Six crates of rifles. Yeah.

289
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,597
You figured somebody
mightjust take 'em on approval.

290
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,910
Could've cooked the goose
that lays the golden eggs.

291
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,989
How's that?

292
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,995
If I hadn't made the right contact here,
I'd have to sell the rest of 'em someplace else.

293
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,038
- You got more?
- Steady supply.

294
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,076
Now that is somethin' I never knew.

295
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,835
So you can see how important it was
to both of us to get started off right.

296
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:44,311
Yeah. I'll give you $100 for every gun you got.

297
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,712
I understand the Comanches
pay five times that. What's this?

298
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,917
Leave that be. If I'd had that then,
I wouldn't have this now.

299
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,878
- You ever dealt with a Comanche direct?
- Can't say I have.

300
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,032
I did. They took everything
I had to sell and went after this.

301
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,917
What stopped 'em?

302
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,391
- Comancheros. Fellas I'm dealing with now.
- Comancheros?

303
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,916
That's right. Fellas with real fine
connections with the Comanche.

304
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,958
They needed me.
I had a steady supply, just like you.

305
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,318
Only it ran out. So now
I'm willing to take on a partner.

306
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,470
When do we meet these Comancheros?

307
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,634
You don't. I do.

308
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,439
No good. I go where these guns go.

309
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,512
- Why?
- You're the only partner I got.

310
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,999
Or will have.

311
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,799
If anything happens to you,
I'm out of business.

312
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,351
That's right. So nothing better
happen to me, huh, partner?

313
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,468
So wrap yourself around your half of this jug
and we'll go out on this town and celebrate.

314
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,913
# Now the moon shines tonight
on pretty Red Wing

315
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,230
# The breeze is sighing

316
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,880
# The night bird's crying

317
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,030
# Far away 'neath the stars

318
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,429
# Her love is sleeping

319
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,592
# While Red Wing's weeping

320
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,390
# Her heart away

321
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,312
How'd you like that, darling? Hearing
my voice sound like a golden trumpet.

322
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,029
Come on, you swamp-toed jungle rat!
Let's get ajug up here.

323
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,396
All right, all right.
Don't get bored. I'm bringing it.

324
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,231
Not that stuff! The good stuff.

325
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,995
- This is the good stuff!
- You think me and my partner are blind?

326
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,033
Just walk slow, boys.
Go home to your firesides bright, huh?

327
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,113
- You shoot pretty good drunk.
- Better drunk than sober.

328
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,668
You know what the secret it?

329
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,513
Soothingness. That's right. Soothingness.

330
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,110
- You see something I don't see?
- No, sir. I don't see nothing.

331
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,233
- You're looking at my scalp, huh?
- No, sir. I ain't.

332
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,632
Well, I still got it, no thanks to you.
And right up here on top where it counts.

333
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,314
If you don't like it,
you can do something about it.

334
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,551
I like it! Very much.

335
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,076
You like it very much?
Maybe I can fix yours the same way.

336
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,551
Beat it.

337
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,509
- What'd you do that for?
- Soothingness, partner.

338
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,388
- Good old McBain. Partners.
- Partners.

339
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,550
Share and share alike.

340
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,313
And by that crimson settin' sun
Peace come to Forest Glade

341
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,518
And of the redskins there was none
For history had been made.

342
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,999
Partner. You win.

343
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,913
You fight a good fight, Ed.
I gotta give you that.

344
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,751
A little quiet around here. Why don't you and
me go someplace we can have some fun?

345
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,831
- Get a steak.
- Good idea.

346
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:19,395
# Oh, the moon shines tonight
on pretty Red Wing

347
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,516
# On pretty Red Wing

348
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,591
# The breeze is sighing...

349
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,755
McBain.

350
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,877
I'm only as drunk as I wanna be, same as you.

351
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,351
Right, partner.

352
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,433
How we gonna round out the evenin'?

353
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,511
- Cigar?
- Thank you.

354
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,873
Why don't we dig up
those guns and go sell 'em?

355
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,679
Not yet, McBain. Not yet.

356
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,116
We gotta grow on each other
a little more, partner.

357
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,837
But I got one rule.
Never go to bed without making a profit.

358
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,912
Did you give any thought
to that game back there?

359
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,391
Let's give it a try.

360
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,111
All right, men. Ante up, please.

361
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,757
Room for two more?

362
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,912
For more men and more money
if you don't mind being separated.

363
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,309
I might as well warn you boys I'm a bad loser.

364
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,675
I'm Ed McBain.

365
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,958
- All right.
- Bill Kane.

366
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,474
- My name's Garth.
- And my name's Tully Crow.

367
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,757
And the name of the game is five-card stud.
Cough up the dues.

368
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,070
Cut the cards if you're a traveller.

369
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,791
Good luck to everybody.

370
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,351
See you.

371
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,269
- Three queens.
- You're sure lucky tonight, brother.

372
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,595
You can't keep from winning tonight,
can you, partner?

373
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,830
They've been runnin' pretty good.

374
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:20,631
But not for me. Seems least a man can do
is let his partner win one now and then.

375
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,192
- You couldn't win one if he let you.
- How is that?

376
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,798
- You play too wild, mister.
- Man's right.

377
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,317
- Luck ain't got a thing to do with cards.
- Not the way those cards was being dealt.

378
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,198
Now, you better do
a little beggin' your pardon.

379
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,750
What for? I don't mind losin'.
I just like to have a run for my money.

380
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,798
- I'll give you your money back.
- Don't do me no favours.

381
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,519
Just try dealin' a hand
straight next time around.

382
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,593
- No call for that kind of talk, mister.
- You better watch your step, brother.

383
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,955
Let's remember we're gentlemen.

384
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,430
Forget it. He's just spittin' out words
to see where they splatter.

385
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,717
You think I miss much?
You think I didn't see that look you passed

386
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:02,828
to this cold-footed, slippery-fingered
gentleman on my right when you sat down?

387
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,832
How many partners
you got in this game, partner?

388
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,717
That's whisky talking, Crow.

389
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,678
You know better than that.
Whisky don't muddle me none.

390
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,311
And you better remember that next time
you run your thumb over them cards.

391
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,030
There ain't gonna be no next time.
I'm gettin' out.

392
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,671
- Give the change to the swabber.
- No, you ain't out. Not till I say so.

393
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,310
Time we both quit, Crow.

394
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,631
You don't like losing to me
and I don't like winning from you.

395
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,236
Nobody's dropping out
till I get my money back.

396
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,231
Mind a suggestion, friend?

397
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,278
The trouble is you don't
enjoy the game for its own reward.

398
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,396
Stimulation, relaxation,

399
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,756
pleasant association
and the interesting conversation.

400
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,910
Shut your mouth.

401
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,988
Keep your seat. Don't cut in on this.

402
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,194
Crow, this isn't gonna get
any better picking at it.

403
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,316
I don't want any quarrel with you.

404
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,709
We got a deal. That's more important.

405
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,473
And, like I said,
I'll give you your money back.

406
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,836
- But I'm walking out.
- You're gonna sit down.

407
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,831
You're gonna play poker.

408
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,754
It might take me longer
to get it back that way, but you got time.

409
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,831
You took it quick enough.

410
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,910
We'll talk about that in the morning.

411
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,709
McBain, you try walkin' out on me now
and see how far you get -

412
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,597
deal or no deal.

413
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,832
You need me as much as I need you, Crow.

414
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,956
Give that some thought.

415
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,396
Self-defence, McBain.

416
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,392
My name ain't McBain,
and you're under arrest.

417
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,678
Thanks for not giving me away, but...

418
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,320
he's dead now. It doesn't matter.

419
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,617
How do you know you killed him?

420
00:35:59,697 --> 00:36:02,796
There wasn't time not to. On your feet!

421
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,471
Give me that peashooter.

422
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,711
Unlock 'em.

423
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,594
I know you know how to handle one of these.

424
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,991
Dig.

425
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,348
- Dig what?
- A hole.

426
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,272
Don't worry. It's for takin' somethin' out.

427
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,718
You haven't asked
why I use the name McBain.

428
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:29,517
Well, you're still a ranger,
so you were working undercover.

429
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:34,628
Maybe you think you'd have been better off
if you'd have just told Crow who I was.

430
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,597
Maybe.

431
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,990
Be glad you didn't.
Then I'd have killed you both.

432
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,469
Well, he made that easier than I would.

433
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,631
Yeah. He was fast.

434
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,711
Fairly.

435
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,835
Fill that up again.

436
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,319
What for?

437
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,473
You wouldn't want someone to fall in there
and break their neck, would ya?

438
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,551
Fill it up.

439
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,148
# Oh, the moon shines tonight
on pretty Red Wing

440
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,356
# On pretty Red Wing

441
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,431
<i>(hums tune)</i>

442
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,829
Well, it's not the moon shinin' out here.

443
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,435
It's the sun and it's hot. It's real hot.

444
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,273
Not back here. It's real cool.

445
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,158
Too bad there's not room for both of us.

446
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,716
If you'll permit me a statement.
This is very uncivilised.

447
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,558
Well, now, Monsewer, that's something
nobody ever accused me of - being civilised.

448
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,359
Especially people
who bend shovels over my head.

449
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,715
I presume you won't take my word of honour

450
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,712
that I would behave
if you permit me back in the wagon.

451
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,518
You presume right.

452
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,229
# Oh, the moon shines tonight
on pretty Red Wing

453
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,197
# On pretty Red Wing

454
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,271
# Da da da-da da

455
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,869
McLain! Have the men roll up
their blankets and saddle up.

456
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,428
We move out in ten minutes.

457
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,149
- Hello, Jake!
- Hello, Bender.

458
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,794
Whoa!

459
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,836
- Hi, Tobe.
- Captain Jake.

460
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,275
- Carson.
- Hi, Jake.

461
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,113
- What's all the ruckus about?
- About 200 Comanches on the Upper Brazos.

462
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,599
Ow!

463
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,240
Major Henry has a patrol out
warning the ranchers.

464
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,880
- That thing hasn't healed up yet?
- Partly.

465
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,269
- It'll be all right.
- You can take it.

466
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,951
Who's that?

467
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,715
Monsewer, you haven't got
the sense of ajack rabbit.

468
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,749
Letting hot horses drink. Keep 'em away
from the water till they've cooled out.

469
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,276
- Don't you know anything about horses?
- I know enough about horses.

470
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,716
When I want one I call a groom.
When I'm done, I call a groom to take him

471
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,870
and the groom says "Yes, sir, Mr Regret".

472
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,159
- That's all I wanna know about horses.
- You better cool off a little yourself.

473
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,915
I'm gonna let you founder
if you want to, but not the horses.

474
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,591
Watch him.

475
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,716
- Hello, Bub.
- Hi, Mr Jake.

476
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,918
- Major.
- Hello, Jake.

477
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,310
I'm surprised to see you.
Who's your prisoner?

478
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,312
That's the fella that escaped.
The $300-suit fella.

479
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,279
- Uh-huh. How did you wind up with him?
- It's a long story, Major.

480
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,352
- Can we get in the shade?
- I don't know why not.

481
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,152
- Here's some fresh water for you.
- Oh, thanks.

482
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,271
That's sure some fancy shirt.

483
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,992
My ma's got one like that.
I never seen none on no man before.

484
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,871
Is this a ranger station?

485
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,748
You're sure ignorant! Ain't you
never seen a grain ranch before?

486
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,230
- What are the rangers doing here?
- Chasing Comanches.

487
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,392
- Comanches? Indians?
- Sure. The worst kind.

488
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,029
Everybody knows that.
Everybody but you, seems like.

489
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,075
- How about Tobe?
- I'm leaving him with you.

490
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,071
I want him to rest his leg.

491
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,116
Say, Jake, uh...

492
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,318
Think you can talk Schofield into
moving into town till this trouble's over?

493
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,437
- I'll do the best I can, Major.
- Thanks, Jake.

494
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,511
All right. Move out!

495
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,313
- Have you watered the horses yet?
- You told me not to.

496
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,391
But they've cooled out now.

497
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,549
Here.

498
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,519
Then I gotta feed you.
Miss Schofield's cooking's too good for you.

499
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,239
Miss Schofield's busy.
Starting to have a baby.

500
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,153
- Is that right?
- He'll have to eat Schofield's cooking.

501
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,879
- Hiya, Jake.
- Hello, Lem.

502
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,473
- Got a little grain for your team.
- Good. Feed 'em.

503
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,711
- I hear your missis is gonna have a baby.
- Pretty soon, I guess.

504
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,395
Great. With things the way they are,
don't you think it'd be a good idea

505
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,358
to get Martha out of here
till the Indian trouble's over?

506
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,355
I'm going to but Martha's having the baby.
I wanted to get in as much grain as I could.

507
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,000
I've just been putting it off.

508
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,231
I got another problem.
I gotta feed this prisoner.

509
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,359
Come here. I don't want you cuffed to me
and I don't wanna lose you.

510
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,992
I don't think you'll be too spry
with this tucked under your arm.

511
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,071
It should hold him.

512
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,077
Let's get to the victuals.

513
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,276
Jim! Feed these horses, will you?

514
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,631
Martha! We've got company.

515
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,912
- Hello there, big Jake.
- Hello, Martha.

516
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,468
Sorry to be using your house
at a time like this.

517
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,915
There's no one I'd rather have than you, Jake.

518
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,788
- Back again, Miss Schofield.
- You're always welcome, Tobe.

519
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,910
Jake.

520
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,399
That young fella with you.
What's that he's carrying under his arm?

521
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,631
Well, that's an anvil, Martha.
He's carrying an anvil.

522
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,230
Why ever would he wanna do that?

523
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,959
He's become attached to it, sort of.

524
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,393
Now, you get back to resting.
We'll make out.

525
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,271
Jake, it's so good to see you.

526
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,231
Pa! You make sure
Jake eats off the good china -

527
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,914
the set him and Bess
give us for our anniversary.

528
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,309
I will, Ma.

529
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,552
Seems like just the other day
that you and Bess was sitting here, eating.

530
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:09,553
Time flies. How long is it
since she's been gone, Jake?

531
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,915
About two years, ain't it?

532
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,150
Two years,

533
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,913
two months, 13 days.

534
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,917
- You make yourself at home, young man.
- Thank you.

535
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,270
Set that anvil up here, Monsewer.

536
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,429
<i>(screams)</i>

537
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,158
Comanches!

538
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,196
- You got any rifles?
- In the corner.

539
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,195
Pretty good shooting for a handgun.

540
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,274
White men riding with Indians.
Comancheros.

541
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,920
That's what I've been
trying to tell Major Henry.

542
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,993
Better get your head down, Jake,
or you'll never tell him again.

543
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,869
- Looks like they're pulling out.
- Don't bet on it.

544
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,313
- How are you fixed for ammunition?
- I could use some.

545
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,039
- I need some.
- I'll see what I can do.

546
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,114
- Any more rifle shells?
- Top drawer, highboy.

547
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,758
Bub, keep that fire going!

548
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,231
Look out! They're regroupin'.

549
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,311
<i>(whooping)</i>

550
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,080
Looks like you lost him again, Jake.

551
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,993
<i>(Tobe) Hold it.
You may need that ammunition.</i>

552
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,153
Kind of surprised to see you back.

553
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,356
I'm kind of surprised I came back.

554
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,678
Looks like this little fracas is about over.

555
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,351
I'll take that gun now.

556
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,311
He didn't make it.

557
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,120
Jake.

558
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,954
I'm gonna take the responsibility
and move all of these settlers out.

559
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,634
Everybody west of the Llano River.

560
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,996
I figure you'll wanna see that
Melinda and her daughter get out.

561
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:44,629
I planned to do that
when I saw the size of this war party.

562
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,792
- Major, there's one other thing.
- Yeah?

563
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,916
Regret.

564
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,549
That's too bad. We owe him something.

565
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,631
But orders are orders.

566
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,040
I thought somebody
could talk to Judge Breen.

567
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:03,398
- If there's a way, the judge'll know it.
- It'd help if you'd talk to him.

568
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,793
He doesn't take too kindly to me since I drew
those fourjacks against his full house.

569
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,871
He just never was a good loser.

570
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,233
I'll be in Llano with the patrol
three days from now, and I'll see you there.

571
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,756
Take a couple of horses
and I'll bring your wagon.

572
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,550
<i>- It's a boy, gentlemen! A boy!
- (Bub) Captain Jake!</i>

573
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,154
New blood in the Schofield family!

574
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,789
He's as red as a lobster
and fightin' mad, but he's a dandy.

575
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,152
We're gonna name him after you, Jake.
Cutter we'll call him. Cutter Schofield.

576
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:42,917
I appreciate the honour, but I think we ought
to name him Regret after Monsewer here.

577
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:48,190
If it wasn't for the Monsewer, our scalps'd
be dangling from some Comanche tepee

578
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,999
and this little tad'd
never grow up to lie about Texas.

579
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:54,629
Regret Schofield. Sounds nice.
May grow up to be president.

580
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,837
- You can take big odds against that.
- It's all settled.

581
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,956
Son, take Regret in to your mother.

582
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,838
Gentlemen, there's ajug in the wellhouse!

583
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:15,355
After what happened back at Schofield's,
you making me a godfather,

584
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,318
aren't you carrying this thing a little too far?

585
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,518
I feel bad about it, Monsewer.
If it was up to me, it'd be different.

586
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:26,559
Who else is it up to?
There's just you and I.

587
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,030
I've thought on it a lot.
Gave myself a lot of argument.

588
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,315
But I just can't do it.

589
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,153
"Let him make a run for it" I say to myself.

590
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:39,677
- Then what would you say?
- I'd say to myself "You can't let him run".

591
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,354
"You swore an oath
when they put that badge on you".

592
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,273
- That's important to you?
- I said I swore an oath.

593
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:50,309
- Words.
- Monsewer, words are what men live by.

594
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,391
Words they say and mean.

595
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,075
You must have had
a real careless upbringing.

596
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,435
However...

597
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,750
Now, please don't get any ideas.

598
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:04,355
Cos it'd break my heart
did I have to put a bullet in your back.

599
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,431
It'd make me sad also.

600
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,310
You've been doing
a lot of complaining about my cooking.

601
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,152
Get ready for the best meal in Texas.

602
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,674
Mommy! Mommy!

603
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,991
Look who's here. Uncle Jake.

604
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:49,237
- Uncle Jake!
- How are you, honey?

605
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,709
- Where's your mommy?
- There.

606
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:58,076
Oh, this is Monsewer Paul Regret, Bessie.

607
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,673
- How you doin'?
- Hi, Monsewer.

608
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,200
- Hello, Jake.
- Hello, Melinda.

609
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:19,517
I, uh... see that the fence
has broken down again.

610
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,878
It only lasts from
one of your visits to the next.

611
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,313
Well, I, uh...

612
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,870
Oh, this is Monsewer Paul Regret.

613
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,992
- How do you do?
- Mrs Marshall.

614
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:33,436
It's a pleasure to meet any friend of Jake's.

615
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,397
Well, thank you, ma'am.

616
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:39,155
My friend Jake here was telling me
you're the best cook in Texas.

617
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,152
Isn't this a wonderful surprise, Mommy?

618
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,709
And I've got a surprise for you, Bessie.

619
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,952
You're going to pack your things
and go into town with Uncle Jake.

620
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,555
There may be some visitors here
that aren't as welcome as us.

621
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,915
- We'll be ready.
- Oh, uh...

622
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,039
Not until my friend here
has tasted some real Texas cooking.

623
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,470
I hope I can live up to your bragging.

624
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:13,908
# Frère Jacques, frère Jacques

625
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,070
# Dormez-vous?

626
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,752
# Dormez-vous?

627
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,110
# Sonnez les matines

628
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,111
# Sonnez les matines

629
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,952
# Ding dang dong

630
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,190
# Ding dang dong

631
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:31,232
Listen, Mommy. We're singing in French.

632
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,673
Go get Mother the silver teapot
that Uncle Jake gave us.

633
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,796
All right, Mommy.

634
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,348
# Frère Jacques...

635
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,955
- Bessie sings well.
- She gets that from her father, I guess.

636
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,031
He had a fine voice.

637
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,118
You said your husband was dead four years.
Was it Indians?

638
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,510
No. He was killed. The battle of San Jacinto.

639
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,594
When Texas won its independence?

640
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,229
The same shell burst hit my husband
and Jake and Sam Houston.

641
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,312
- They were all standing together.
- President Sam Houston?

642
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,313
No, he wasn't president then.
That was before we were a republic.

643
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,914
Then Jake brought my husband's body home.

644
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,595
He made us move away
from the frontier and take this place.

645
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,313
Your Bessie's named after Jake's wife.

646
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,996
We grew up together. Everybody was
so surprised when she married Jake.

647
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:28,632
They were so different. He's so big
and tough - at least on the outside.

648
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,314
And she was so tiny and so gentle.

649
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,395
But one never knows about those things.

650
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,789
They got along just fine.

651
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,713
Well, I better go inspect Bessie's progress.

652
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,479
- Captain Jake?
- Yeah?

653
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:54,553
Can you give me one good reason
why you don't marry that woman?

654
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,029
Why don't you mind your own business?

655
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,596
I haven't got one good reason...
that'd make sense to you.

656
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,716
Every time I quit to get married,

657
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:11,715
that miserable, low-down silver-tongued
Houston starts bending my ear

658
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,270
about how Texas needs
every man and every gun,

659
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,670
what with this Comanche
and renegade trouble.

660
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:22,389
But duty and patriotism
doesn't make sense to you.

661
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,995
- You think I'm simple-minded.
- Yes, I do think you're simple-minded.

662
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:30,278
Well, don't make a point of saying that
too often. And once more'll be too often.

663
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,396
- But I envy you.
- You what?

664
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,792
Two women in one man's lifetime.
Yeah, I really do envy you.

665
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,793
I guess you're right. I'm God-given lucky.

666
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,716
It really happened to me.

667
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,314
At least I think it really happened to me.

668
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:52,073
I suppose I can't be too sure about it
cos I just met the girl.

669
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,993
Well, it doesn't go by the calendar.

670
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:58,277
It either is or it isn't.
Time doesn't have much to do with it.

671
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:00,920
Yeah? Then it happened to me.

672
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,469
- Why'd you let her get away?
- Because a big ugly character with a star

673
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,154
snapped some handcuffs on me
and dragged me away.

674
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,231
- The woman at the boat?
- Yeah.

675
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,798
Well, I'm sorry, Monsewer. Real sorry.

676
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,991
Captain Jake, I believe you.

677
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:21,119
I actually believe that
you're really sincerely sorry.

678
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,236
You've got a lot of Cupid in you

679
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,471
but, I must admit,
Cupid picked a strange place to hide.

680
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,433
Monsewer, you may not
live long enough to hang.

681
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,311
Your brougham awaits.

682
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,559
You go down and take care of the horses.

683
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,631
Remember I'm watching.

684
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,071
Ya!

685
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,272
- Take care of the team, will ya, Lem?
- Yes, sir.

686
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,633
Linda, this is a surprise.

687
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,711
- Hello, Jake.
- Hello, Mrs Breen.

688
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:21,588
- Looks like we'll be on your hands awhile.
- My, Bessie, how you have grown.

689
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,478
- Where's the judge?
- In his office with some rangers.

690
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:28,917
You better go in and get located.
We'll take care of this stuff later.

691
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,149
Think this friend of yours
will be of much help?

692
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,515
I wouldn't hold out
too much hope, Monsewer.

693
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,878
My conscience'll be clear. I'll have done
all I could to keep you from gettin' hung.

694
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,951
Oh, great. As I drop through the trap,

695
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,476
my last thought'll be
"Well, big Jake did all he could".

696
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,990
- Evenin', Jake.
- Judge.

697
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,992
- This is Monsewer Paul Regret.
- How do you do?

698
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:02,072
I'm Thadeus Jackson Breen.
Judge of the Texas Circuit Court.

699
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:05,197
Most say - except them that's unfair-minded -

700
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,556
that I'm the finest legal mind
in the entire Southwest.

701
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,313
So you can have faith in your lawyer, son.

702
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,233
- How much money you got?
- I don't have any.

703
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,675
I begin to doubt your chances
against the law.

704
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,149
Judge, you're doing this one for nothing.

705
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,196
A workman is worthy of his hire.

706
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,068
Sure, but suppose
these rangers start talking?

707
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:29,597
About where a certain Judge was during a
ranger raid on a certain section of this town.

708
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,639
- I was advising a client.
- And a pretty one she was, too, Judge.

709
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,915
Seemed to be hangin'
on every word you said.

710
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,630
See, Regret? We don't aim to just stand by
and see a fellow fighting man go down.

711
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,234
Not without doing everything
that we can for him.

712
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:47,438
- I don't understand.
- Major here's told me what your troubles are.

713
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,798
I've thought it over in the light of my
40 years' experience in legal jurisprudence,

714
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,235
and I've come to the positive conclusion

715
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,869
that there ain't no way
to do this legal and honest.

716
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:02,670
But, being good, sensible Texans,
we'll do her illegal and dishonest.

717
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,275
All the boys here in the room
have agreed to sign a paper I've prepared.

718
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:12,832
We're gonna all commit perjury. That's
legal language for a plain dumb-blasted lie.

719
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,197
Every man in this room's gonna swear
that you are a member of the Texas Rangers,

720
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,316
and have been for the last couple of years.

721
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,631
Ain't no possible chance
you killed nobody in Louisiana.

722
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:27,554
Even Sam Houston himself wouldn't go up
against the word of a dozen rangers.

723
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:32,873
So, my boy, you are a member of the finest
underpaid organisation of men in the world.

724
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:38,556
- I don't know what to say.
- It's better than gettin' your neck stretched.

725
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:43,998
Well, thanks, men. It isn't only modesty
that makes me doubt I'll make a good ranger.

726
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:47,914
If I had some money,
I'd buy you something to celebrate with.

727
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,673
Credit can be arranged.
My brother's saloon.

728
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,318
<i>(all) Sure!</i>

729
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,711
Honest Ben Breen.

730
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,317
- Jake.
- Yeah?

731
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:04,392
- Tobe insists he's the third man.
- Oh.

732
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:08,029
- I was born and raised in the Bend Country.
- You're only 18 years old.

733
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:11,078
At 18, you were the only white man
south of the Pecos.

734
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:15,358
You told us till we were sick and tired of
hearing how you settled up Pecos Country.

735
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,353
We get to be bores as we get older. He'll do.

736
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,557
Now, Tobe, keep this wagon
in sight at all times.

737
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,518
- Let us know you're around.
- Don't worry.

738
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,998
I appreciate your volunteering, Regret.
Shows mighty fine spirit.

739
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,036
Good luck, men.

740
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,031
Did I volunteer for something?

741
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:38,715
You weren't handy. I knew
you'd want me to speak up for you.

742
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:43,075
Jake, I often wonder
what I ever did to deserve you.

743
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:44,149
Yee-ha!

744
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,438
I've often had every penny I own
on the turn of a card,

745
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,556
but never my life on a bundle of feathers.

746
01:01:55,640 --> 01:02:00,031
- You claim to be a gambler, don't you?
- This may cure me permanently.

747
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:16,229
Our guardian angel's still on the job.

748
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:41,393
Why the mystery with the frying pan, sir?
Why does he have to stay out of sight -

749
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:44,756
alone in the middle of 1,000 miles
of this ugly Texas country.

750
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,751
Don't you bet on that, gambler.

751
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,479
An Indian speciality is not being seen.

752
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,631
Kick out the fire.

753
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,871
Cutter.

754
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,754
Put it away. They're tame.

755
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:11,230
- Tame? Tame Indians?
- Tame as dishwater.

756
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,511
<i>(speaking in native language)</i>

757
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,388
Well, I think we can afford one cigar.

758
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,711
Huh?

759
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,191
Oh, no. No whisky.

760
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:42,318
Tame Indians!
How do you tell the difference?

761
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,789
How do you know these
from the wild ones?

762
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,031
It's pretty hard to explain to a city fella.

763
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:51,078
But you take
like that snake there at your feet.

764
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,151
Don't shoot him, he's a gopher snake.

765
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,232
He's a friend. He eats mice and rats.

766
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,311
We'll put him in the shade.

767
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,230
You see those darker markings?
Crosspatch overlay?

768
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,276
Makes him look like a rattler,

769
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,828
but you can see a thousand like that one.

770
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,232
And when you see your first rattlesnake,
you'll know the difference.

771
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:19,591
You still haven't told me how you tell
a Comanche from a tame Indian.

772
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:23,036
It's just like your first rattler.
One look and you'll know.

773
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:25,588
Come on. Get aboard.

774
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,471
Ya!

775
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,634
<i>(Jake) Big country.</i>

776
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,234
<i>(Regret) Is this where
we'll find the Comancheros?</i>

777
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:57,155
You could hide the state of Louisiana here
and never find 'em if they didn't want you to.

778
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,800
That's ourjob, findin' 'em.

779
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,871
Or lettin' them find us.

780
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:20,354
Well, old Tobe is still on the job.

781
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:24,232
You know, I'm tryin'
to go along with your thinking.

782
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:29,189
But do you really believe that emblem will
convince a Comanche that we're gunrunners?

783
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,669
- It had better.
- Yeah.

784
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,271
What's the matter?

785
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,191
I don't know.

786
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,515
Comanches!

787
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,198
He's alone.

788
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:29,236
I hope that Tobe isn't taking a nap.

789
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:35,992
Well, we're about to find out
whether this passport'll work.

790
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:29,351
<i>Comancheros! Comancheros! Rifles!</i>

791
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,398
Comancheros!

792
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,389
I wish I had more practice at praying.

793
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:36,354
Comancheros! Comancheros!

794
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,271
Over here, my friends! Whisky!

795
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,828
Over here! Whisky! Here, whisky!

796
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,911
Over here, my friends.

797
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,071
Whisky!

798
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:45,510
You got a unique way
of paying off your help around here.

799
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,431
Who's ramrodding this outfit?

800
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,636
You'll find out. What do you want?

801
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:53,395
Monsewer, break open that false wagon bed.

802
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:59,398
My name's McBain.
I got guns and I wanna do business.

803
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:10,110
72 rifles... just like this one.

804
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,395
Pass 'em out. Let the boys handle 'em.

805
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,671
Hold it!

806
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,589
You must be the boss man.

807
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:36,475
We brought 72 of these.

808
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,075
Just like this... except without firing pins.

809
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:43,232
Be useless to you
unless you do business with us.

810
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,914
Your presence here has made me very happy.

811
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,671
<i>Bastinado!</i>

812
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,591
The pretty man from the boat.

813
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,833
It's gonna get awful thirsty around here.

814
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,993
Better think of a new plan, Jake.
This one didn't work out so well.

815
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:11,390
The hell it didn't.
We found the hide-out, didn't we?

816
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:14,916
Yeah. I wonder if they know
how much trouble they're in.

817
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,720
Water.

818
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,234
Give me some water.

819
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:55,999
- Who ordered this?
- Amelung.

820
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:01,115
Cut them down and take care of them.

821
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:07,148
- Cut them down and care for them.
- This was orders.

822
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,231
I said cut them down!

823
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:26,433
Oh! The top of my head
feels like an overdone pancake.

824
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:34,471
Say, you never did tell me
what happened to me after I was knocked out.

825
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:38,709
Well, a handsome young woman
on a horse came along.

826
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,799
She must have figured
it was Saturday night and we needed a bath.

827
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,429
Pretty boy, hurry it up. We're waitin' for you.

828
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:54,795
I can do without the endearing words.

829
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,314
- We going somewhere?
- Trial.

830
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:01,154
- Trial?
- See whether you live or die. You'll die.

831
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:04,391
I always figured to die. Question is, when?

832
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,870
Just hurry it up.

833
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:09,675
You have broken a law of the society.

834
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,194
The penalty is death.

835
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:16,239
<i>- Does the society approve?
- (shouting)</i>

836
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:26,074
Don't kill them! I beg you! I beg you!

837
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:47,516
You may still wonder when, big man,
but now you know how.

838
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:50,549
We go, my friends.

839
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:55,350
Got another one of those fellas
uses that "my friend" stuff real careless.

840
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:00,559
<i>(angry shouting)</i>

841
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:03,393
Quiet! Quiet! Get back to your seats!

842
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,471
Be civilised, my people.

843
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,919
We have guests today.
There's work to be done.

844
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:22,510
Gentlemen, you come among us uninvited.

845
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,591
The penalty for that is death.

846
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,833
This society survives by its secrecy only.

847
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:32,118
You haven't violated that by entering here,
but you could if you left here.

848
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:36,671
And it is our intention to see to it
that this secrecy is never violated.

849
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:42,517
Now, as to this story of yours that you will
bring us rifles without firing mechanisms,

850
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,989
take out our money
and return with other rifles,

851
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:48,868
and the firing mechanisms
of the first shipment...

852
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,877
I admit, it has the merit
of being well thought out.

853
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,117
- You say your name is McBain?
- Ed McBain.

854
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:04,752
We know of a McBain. And it's told that this
McBain killed a man of ours in Sweetwater.

855
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:08,435
You mean Crow?
Fella with the half-scalped topknot?

856
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:12,035
- You killed him?
- Seemed like the thing to do at the moment.

857
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:18,596
It hardly surprises to me to hear
that Crow got himself killed.

858
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,672
If his occupation didn't, his manner would.

859
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,036
Your name is Paul Regret?

860
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,238
<i>(woman) That is his name.</i>

861
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:30,114
His occupation is gambler.

862
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,919
- Pilar!
- We meet again.

863
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,557
I told you, sir.
That is the man she went back to search for.

864
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,393
Many wasted days trying to find him again.

865
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:43,553
He left New Orleans after killing a man.
The other man I don't know.

866
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:47,633
He killed Crow, which speaks well
for his speed with a gun.

867
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:50,996
It doesn't give him the right
to enter the place of our society

868
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,753
or to live, after having
discovered its whereabouts.

869
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,513
It is clear they know, so they die. It is a rule.

870
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,512
A rule you made many years ago
and enforced many times.

871
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,591
It is of little concern to me what you do,

872
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:04,717
though I say it would be
intelligent to deal with them.

873
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,951
They offer us a continuing supply
of up-to-date weapons

874
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:11,635
instead of the few old-fashioned rifles
we get from the South.

875
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:16,430
<i>Do as you will. Just remember that you
expect me to take over responsibilities.</i>

876
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:20,479
Therefore I presume
you would be willing to heed my opinion.

877
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:25,236
But if you prefer to placate
that bloodthirsty mongrel of yours,

878
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,595
then kill them.

879
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,552
I tell you, she has
a personal interest in this man.

880
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,790
That is why she urges us to deal with him.

881
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,950
Amelung, you're a fool.

882
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,758
I've raised her never to let
emotion cloud ajudgment,

883
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:42,195
which is what you're doing at this moment.

884
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:46,353
Yourjealousy is apparent
and it's warping yourjudgment.

885
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,751
That is all.

886
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,789
Bring those prisoners to my quarters!

887
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,351
- Esteban.
- Pilarcita.

888
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:11,557
Look over there. The taller of the two men.

889
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,915
Have you seen him before?

890
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:16,911
Galveston?

891
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,878
We were getting off the boat
in the grey dawn,

892
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:22,349
and he was boarding just as it docked.

893
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:25,079
Oh, yes. Now I remember.

894
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:29,718
You know, McBain, that plan of yours
about the guns delights me.

895
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:34,237
It starts from the basic proposition
that nobody is trustworthy.

896
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:37,039
We couldn't double-cross
each other if we tried.

897
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:40,271
I can't wait to see the look on Amelung's face.

898
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:46,515
Don't get the idea that my reproof of Amelung
indicates that I've adopted you two.

899
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:48,909
I must put him in his place now and then.

900
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,991
Help yourself to some wine.

901
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,269
What do you think of our place, McBain?

902
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:58,436
It took a lot of lookin'
to find just such a layout.

903
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:03,955
I stumbled on it some 30-odd years ago. I was
a different man physically, as you'll gather.

904
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:08,318
At that time, there was a motley collection
of people dealing with the Indians.

905
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,834
I brought organisation to the business.

906
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:15,391
May I call your attention to the powder mill?
We make our own powder.

907
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:20,679
The nitrates come from our own mines,
the saltpetre from deposits to the south.

908
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:23,718
You're a travelled man, Mr Regret.
What do you think of it?

909
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,995
Seems to lack nothing.

910
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:28,514
- You've done very well.
- I think so.

911
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:33,151
Lest you think all of this talk is the idle
chatter of a broken chairbound man,

912
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,549
I tell you this for a reason.

913
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:40,839
We have a society here, a society
that's different from anything visualised

914
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:42,911
by people anywhere in the world.

915
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,197
The rules of this society
are magnificently simple.

916
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,911
Transgress and you die.

917
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,636
Long and painfully. Look over there.

918
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,191
Not a pretty picture, is it?

919
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:02,831
A Chinese philosopher once said
that a picture is worth a thousand words.

920
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:09,550
He stole. We, a society of thieves,
cannot tolerate stealing from each other.

921
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,835
Take a long look over there and decide

922
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:16,516
whether or not you intend to faithfully
follow the rules of our society.

923
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,591
Gordo.

924
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,471
I'll send for you in due time.

925
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:34,632
I'll bet that old boy was a man to stand
aside from when he was young and limber.

926
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:38,679
Right now, if he took a dislike to you,
you could get yourself killed in a hurry.

927
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,876
What bothers me is finding that girl here.

928
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:44,236
- Where do you know her from?
- I know her - or knew her briefly.

929
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,550
Briefly? You must have made quite a dent.

930
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:49,313
She seems to favour us staying alive,
or at least you.

931
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,391
That was the girl on the boat.

932
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,638
Oh.

933
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,915
We got ourselves two problems.

934
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,434
But the first one's to stay alive.

935
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:02,069
Toward dark, Major Henry and the boys
are gonna come over that hill

936
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,230
and we'd better have a place to fight from.

937
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:07,835
- Fight with what?
- Naturally, when the war breaks out,

938
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:11,629
we're gonnajump a couple of
these gentlemen and borrow their guns.

939
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:14,473
Well, naturally. So natural that I overlooked it.

940
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:18,075
You take off the road in this direction,
and keep your eyes peeled.

941
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,310
- I'll go the other way.
- All right.

942
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:08,076
Miss Graile?

943
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:11,835
This is the first chance I've had to thank you
for getting us out of the sun.

944
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,833
- You're welcome.
- In a way, I feel I don't owe you any thanks.

945
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:21,072
If it weren't for that good-looking fella,
by now I'd be approaching the well-done.

946
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:25,358
- How long have you known Paul Regret?
- Off and on for quite a while.

947
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:29,752
I'm beginning to doubt if it was wise to
save him. From now on, he'll be insufferable.

948
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:32,479
You're not exactly making yourself clear.

949
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,313
That fool Amelung had to shout
I went searching for Paul.

950
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:39,916
Now he'll be so sure of me, he'll be
impossible to manage... Or so he thinks.

951
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,276
But I shall find the opportunity
to teach him otherwise.

952
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,349
<i>(chuckles)</i>

953
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:49,230
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just... glad
that I'm not your age or Regret's.

954
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,719
I went through all that.

955
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:55,476
Me and my wife used to fight like a couple
of wildcats with only one tree between us.

956
01:21:55,560 --> 01:22:01,157
But you soon find out that it doesn't make
a tinker's damn who's got the upper hand.

957
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:05,995
A few years roll by and you kinda settle down
to being at ease with each other.

958
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,435
Then life gets worth living.

959
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,318
In every relationship between human beings,

960
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:15,075
one is dominant and one is subservient.

961
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:18,277
The way you make it sound,
life'd be one long war.

962
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:22,592
- Isn't it?
- Missy, you got a lot of surprise coming.

963
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:25,069
Some good, some bad.

964
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,110
Mr McBain!

965
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,632
Speaking of surprises,
Mr McBain, there's something...

966
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:42,709
<i>(screaming)</i>

967
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,358
<i>(gunshots)</i>

968
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:06,711
<i>(speaks in native language)</i>

969
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:11,354
- Is that Chief Iron Shirt?
- Yes.

970
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:15,433
Now we'll have a celebration.
All of his visits call for one.

971
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,636
First time I've ever seen him in the flesh.

972
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:22,919
Mr McBain, I might enjoy prolonging
this conversation with you but for one thing.

973
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,356
Your name. Naturally, it's not McBain.

974
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,715
<i>Well, a man in my business
uses many names;</i>

975
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:32,679
- Just what is your business?
- At the moment, I'm a gunrunner.

976
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:36,514
Three weeks ago, as I was getting off
the boat in Galveston, you went aboard.

977
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:39,194
You wore a Texas Rangers star on your shirt.

978
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:44,509
You're poised, Mr, uh...
whatever your name is.

979
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:47,239
What for? Flight?

980
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,038
Where could you go?

981
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:53,079
To fight? You are unarmed
and there are hundreds of us.

982
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,914
You're the coolest character I ever met.

983
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,274
<i>(gunshots continue)</i>

984
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:00,430
What happens now?

985
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:02,511
I don't know.

986
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:16,951
Hello, Pilar.

987
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,070
Women. How can you figure 'em?
She's been chasin' me for three weeks.

988
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:28,869
- Saves my life and now she won't talk to me.
- Saved my life, too.

989
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:33,909
I don't think you better put that girl in a class
with any of the other girls you've known.

990
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,195
She'll never act the way you figure.

991
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:40,353
As a matter of fact, I wish I knew how she
was gonna act about a certain little matter.

992
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:42,874
She knows I'm a ranger.

993
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,076
Told me so in no uncertain terms.

994
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,754
We better get to that corral
and get us some horses.

995
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:50,149
Try to make it to the top?
What chance'd we have?

996
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:52,708
- Not much...
- No chance at all.

997
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:57,271
- We can jump those Comancheros...
- Monsewer, you've changed.

998
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:00,272
I thought you were the fella
that took care of number one.

999
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:02,476
Well, I've gotten used to you.

1000
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,199
We'll just sit tight. The girl's got a problem.

1001
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:09,319
She points her finger at me
and hollers "Ranger", your head goes too.

1002
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:12,073
She seems to put quite a value on you.

1003
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:16,233
So we'll just hold on
for a few hours and give Tobe a chance.

1004
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:35,836
If they keep this up, they'll save the rangers
the trouble. Probably kill themselves all off.

1005
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,551
Paul.

1006
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,950
Paul, there's some...

1007
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:21,793
I've been wanting to do that for a long time.

1008
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:28,876
Paul, there's something I've got to tell you.

1009
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,391
Pilar.

1010
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:35,951
I hope I'm not intruding.

1011
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,355
Mr McBain!

1012
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:42,193
I'd like to invite you
to join us for dinner tonight.

1013
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:47,513
I suppose that good manners force me
to include your romantically inclined friend.

1014
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:53,433
You'll find she has a mind of her own.

1015
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,511
Gordo.

1016
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,911
After sundown on the terrace.

1017
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:07,675
It looks like
the condemned men'll eat a hearty dinner.

1018
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:28,911
Let's go. Move out!

1019
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,511
<i>Gracias, señor.</i>

1020
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:10,357
Esteban! 300 more for him.

1021
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:15,319
Oh, gentlemen. If you'll excuse me
for about ten minutes. Business.

1022
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,789
Gordo, give them some refreshments.

1023
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:30,349
- Don't mind me.
- I'm glad you're here.

1024
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:33,830
I've been trying to tell you all day.
Your friend has one chance.

1025
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:37,037
A horse and provisions for you
will be waiting by the stairs.

1026
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,111
You can escape sometime tonight.

1027
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:42,272
- Will there be a gun in the saddle?
- Don't make conditions.

1028
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:44,191
How naive do you think we are?

1029
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:47,397
If he's followed,
he'll never make it to the top of the rim.

1030
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:49,471
- You refuse to accept my plan?
- Well...

1031
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:54,759
Shut up. Keep losing your patience
and then we'll find out what happens next.

1032
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:58,037
All right. I've done all I can.
You're on your own.

1033
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:11,231
<i>So. Unless I let your man kill him,
and stay here with you like a maquereau...</i>

1034
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:14,153
<i>- That's French...
- I know what it means, mon cher ami.</i>

1035
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,674
It's pretty obvious that you feel I'm unique.

1036
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:19,718
Oh, your modesty
is your most appealing quality.

1037
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:23,793
You backtracked trying to find me again.
And I feel the same way about you.

1038
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:28,396
We can't stay here together. You can't stay
in Texas, being wanted by the authorities.

1039
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:32,632
So we'll go somewhere else.
Anywhere else. Just you and me.

1040
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:34,597
How do I know you're not lying?

1041
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:38,468
You don't. There's no way
you can prove that I'm not lying.

1042
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,438
Every time a man and a woman
talk like this to each other,

1043
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:45,035
neither can prove to themselves
that they aren't being lied to.

1044
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:48,590
Pilar, what all this adds up to
is that I love you.

1045
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,833
And there's no way
you can tell whether I'm not lying.

1046
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,911
You believe or don't believe.

1047
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:13,391
Good evening, friend.

1048
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,591
Excuse me, Pilarcita.

1049
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:34,669
I've been told to have the wagon brought here
at dawn so that these two men may leave.

1050
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:37,194
But I'll bring it myself so there's no mistakes.

1051
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,271
Thank you, Esteban.

1052
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:50,075
<i>- Viejo?
- Yeah?</i>

1053
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:52,151
How about a light?

1054
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:54,711
<i>El grande mucho.</i>

1055
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:03,000
<i>- Muchísimas gracias.
- De nada.</i>

1056
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:09,391
<i>(speaks in native language)</i>

1057
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:24,837
You must give me your opinion
about the wine we're having.

1058
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:27,309
Our own grapes, you know.

1059
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:31,996
Oh, it would be a shame to have our guest
of honour drown in a plate of soup.

1060
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:38,550
Gentlemen, you must forgive the noble chief.
His semi-annual visits are a great occasion.

1061
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:40,756
- Papa.
- Yes?

1062
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:43,070
I'm leaving here for ever.

1063
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:45,355
I'm going away with Paul.

1064
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:48,352
This is no life for me
and this is no place for you.

1065
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:52,678
How frail is human judgment,
particularly the female's.

1066
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:57,880
It would be common sense to pick
the big ugly one and not the handsome one.

1067
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:00,918
He has definite indications
of character in his face.

1068
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,834
That big nose that someone broke
at one time, the scars above the eyebrows

1069
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:09,630
all show that at one time he has enforced,
or tried to enforce, his will upon others.

1070
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:12,553
Obviously a man of great determination.

1071
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:17,592
Thank you, Mr Graile. Compliments are
always welcome, no matter what the source.

1072
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:20,035
- A wonderful man!
- Papa, stop this!

1073
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:23,795
I'm in no mood.
I'm leaving and I wish you would leave, too.

1074
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:27,395
Iron Shirt can get you to the south
and from there, the world is wide.

1075
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:29,152
You can go where you choose.

1076
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:32,550
Why should I die in a place
other than the one I made for myself?

1077
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:36,189
- Why are you so anxious that I leave?
- This place is no longer safe.

1078
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:38,510
The authorities know its location.

1079
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:46,712
I'm afraid the noble chief may not rejoin us.

1080
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:50,918
He inherited that armour from his grandfather
who fought the Conquistadores.

1081
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:54,879
I leap to the conclusion
that you are the authorities.

1082
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:59,158
I was afraid that the little lady's remark
would spill the beans.

1083
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:03,079
Now, Papa, in a very short time,

1084
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:06,709
a company of rangers
is gonna come boiling in here,

1085
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:09,439
and you'll hurry your end if you don't behave.

1086
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:13,308
Mr McBain, you're introducing
a discordant note here.

1087
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:27,632
He followed these two.
They signalled back and forth.

1088
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:32,271
Ah, what a shame.
It looks like company's not coming.

1089
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:36,152
Mr McBain, would you mind
handing over your pistol?

1090
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:37,958
Monsewer...

1091
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:39,996
charge.

1092
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:48,831
<i>(mumbles drunkenly)</i>

1093
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:00,675
What's your story? Saving bullets?

1094
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:03,350
Couldn't afford the sound of a shot.

1095
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:07,752
- You looked to be doing all right.
- For a while there, it was even money.

1096
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:13,555
- Now, Papa...
- Not quite, Mr McBain.

1097
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:15,631
Gordo!

1098
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:32,511
Well, get him off me!

1099
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:35,351
- Is that a closet?
- Yes.

1100
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:40,591
Keep a lookout on the terrace.

1101
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:53,711
My daughter forgets that in the eyes of Texas
justice, she may not be an innocent party.

1102
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:57,156
You know the oath you put so much faith in,
the words men live by?

1103
01:34:57,240 --> 01:35:01,472
Make up your mind to this. When we get over
the top o' the rim, we're partin' company.

1104
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:04,757
You can take him north,
but she and I are goin' south.

1105
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:06,398
- Mexico?
- For a start.

1106
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:10,519
There's 1,000 miles of Indian territory.
Apache and Yaqui.

1107
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:12,477
I figure she's worth it.

1108
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,949
You made it, Monsewer! That's love.

1109
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:18,348
<i>(Graile) You're all fools.</i>

1110
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:22,951
<i>(Jake) But it's fun sometimes,
particularly when you're their age.</i>

1111
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,469
You really think you'll make it, huh?

1112
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:28,869
You ordered the wagon.

1113
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:32,077
And now, Papa, we'll just sit quietly and wait.

1114
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,311
He was only 18 years old.

1115
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:54,715
I'm going to take particular delight
in seeing you hang.

1116
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,991
<i>(cock crows)</i>

1117
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:13,551
<i>(snoring)</i>

1118
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:44,519
Esteban, I ask you to endure great risk for me.

1119
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:48,869
Esteban, make your choice.

1120
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:53,270
All trussed up like a pigeon ready for market.

1121
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:00,710
Bring those rifles and cartridges.

1122
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,436
Yahoo! Comanchero!

1123
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:38,633
Comanchero! Comanchero!

1124
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:41,678
<i>(Graile continues yelling)</i>

1125
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:24,477
Charge, Monsewer!

1126
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,991
<i>(gunshots)</i>

1127
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,751
<i>(gunshots)</i>

1128
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,151
Hand me that lantern!

1129
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:37,551
Look!

1130
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:32,472
Paul!

1131
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:00,989
Yah, it's the rangers!
The best in Texas! Ha-ha!

1132
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:10,831
Load this.

1133
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:20,155
Well, Monsewer.

1134
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:25,236
Looks like I've lost you again.

1135
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:31,070
Mr McBain, or whatever your name is,

1136
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:33,116
we'll miss you.

1137
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:35,794
We've kind of gotten used to you.

1138
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,911
Big Jake! Don't forget to mend those fences.
