1
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,382
...and them as were still alive,
where'd they go?

2
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:37,876
Every which way,
like ghosts, on the fields...

3
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:40,761
By October, the town was deserted.

4
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:45,550
All you heard was:
"Step aside, it's the undertakers!"

5
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:49,334
They piled them together,
dead and plagued,

6
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:52,841
They tried to gather them
from every corner of town

7
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,584
but the dead stayed in the streets
'til the undertakers came.

8
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:00,087
Then they buried them in gardens.

9
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,549
And the fearsome death
kept on 'til January.

10
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:07,921
- Poor souls.
- Great woe for the Christians!

11
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:10,841
- There was also thieves dressed as undertakers.
- How so?

12
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,585
With a red scarf 'round their necks.

13
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:16,842
They went around thieving,
taking money, silverware...

14
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:22,344
People fled them like death,
for they picked up the ill, too,

15
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,549
threw them into the wagon
and hit them with a bat over the head.

16
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,549
But worse still
were the living abandoned

17
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:32,042
with no cover
on the frozen fields.

18
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,379
All around you heard the screams

19
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,632
of the miserable souls
in the fields at Dudesti...

20
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,797
Ah, Christ's blood!

21
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:47,170
And we, the living,

22
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:50,211
thought ourselves dead
and wandered around, dazed.

23
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:56,296
WALLACHIA, 1835

24
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:34,544
Look, Satan's coming!

25
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:38,340
Oi, aunt, wait!

26
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:39,794
Good day to you, constable.

27
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:43,216
As good as your soul!
Are you scared?

28
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,218
NO.

29
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,756
Good, the clear sky
fears not the lightning.

30
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,551
- Who are you?
- A good soul.

31
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,502
We'll see 'bout that.

32
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,252
Whence are you coming?

33
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:56,500
I'm of Geanache's.
Leana by name...

34
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,548
I think I know you.

35
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,340
Where are you going, you hag?

36
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:09,876
Taking my ol' man
to kiss the Virgin's icon.

37
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:14,092
He is dying
and will leave me alone.

38
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,460
- What ails him?
- The fever.

39
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:20,292
Go away! It could be the cholera!
You'll kill us.

40
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,460
You didn't ask.

41
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:26,084
You should have told us
yourself, stupid cow!

42
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,969
I ought to give your fat ass
a whipping...

43
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:30,760
Fuck you, crane!

44
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:36,042
- Did you cross the forest?
- Nay, I was afraid.

45
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,050
- Are the Gypsy gold panners still in the forest?
- I don't know.

46
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,835
Where are you taking your man?

47
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,379
I hope to find a nun
to give him some herbs...

48
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:49,338
She'll give him some bell juice,
priest's song...

49
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:53,965
...and some spade oil.

50
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,093
Out of my sight!

51
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:05,009
- Filthy plague rat...
- Barefoot hag,..

52
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,882
- We have business with the abbot.
- What business?

53
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,969
A secret from boyar Candescu.

54
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,926
Father Superior!

55
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:02,843
The poor prays more than the rich,
'cause he has time.

56
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,253
Lord be with us!

57
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,377
Good day, bright lord.

58
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,877
The constable is here
for some enquiries.

59
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:38,170
If you know anything, speak up.

60
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,967
- How many souls here?
- Thirty souls. Ten died...

61
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:45,545
- Who's Carfin's sister?
- Me, bright lord.

62
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,131
- Where's he off to, you crow?
- I don't know.

63
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,587
Haven't seen him since I was sold
to the monastery here..

64
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:54,760
- You don't know, eh?!
- I don't!

65
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:58,838
- Tell him!
- Stay out of it, that's my craft.

66
00:08:00,042 --> 00:08:02,044
- Crow, what's your name?
- Pena.

67
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:07,259
- Want to taste this whip?
- I sure don't.

68
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,586
Where is he, filthy whore?

69
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:16,175
Tell me, or
I'll whip all you slaves to death!

70
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,302
- Where is he?
- We don't know nothing, sir.

71
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:25,507
- I'll give you a silver coin.
- We don't know.

72
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:30,793
The monks beat us all the time,
but we don't know.

73
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,291
- Say what?
- Said we don't know!

74
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:35,260
He went to the gold panners.

75
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,094
- How do you know?
- He told me when we were sowing.

76
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:42,092
Said there's more freedom there.

77
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:45,340
- Fine,
- Merciful lord, the coin!

78
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:49,337
Fuck off, crows!
You'll get the coin when I find him.

79
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,961
Back to work, crows!

80
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:14,626
- Gypsies, can't change them...
- Don't we know it?!

81
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:19,633
Our own good brandy.

82
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,343
Enjoy it.

83
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:26,963
- Worthy of the Wedding at Cana!
- Our thanks, Father.

84
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,381
God be with you.

85
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,552
- How 'bout a riddle?
- Let's hear it.

86
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:41,132
"Lifeless out of life,
life out of lifeless."

87
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,131
Doomsday...

88
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,335
No. You say it, Ionita.

89
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,177
The egg,
for the hen lays it lifeless,

90
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:57,045
and when it hatches,
it comes to life.

91
00:09:58,292 --> 00:09:59,635
The chicken!

92
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:05,636
Go with the Lord.

93
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,877
I'm getting lame...

94
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,877
Father, I'm cold.

95
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:39,841
If you caught
that fever, you're fucked.

96
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,677
Cholera morbus,
as the big doctors say...

97
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,710
You're such a waste of bread!

98
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:01,170
How's he going to be an officer?

99
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,462
If you slap him,
he'll die of grief,

100
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,256
- Ain't that you?
- No, faint.

101
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,669
Watch your mouth.

102
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:12,090
Honour thy mother and father,
as the Gospel says,

103
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,753
for a father weighs more
than twelve children...

104
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,923
Sure I honour you.

105
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:20,421
Stab the enemy like a man!

106
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,052
This is a sword from Ianina,
show some respect!

107
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,674
Not bad, the priest's brandy!
Cures any sickness,

108
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:37,464
- Try some.
- Don't want to.

109
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:39,465
Drink like a man!

110
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,049
You don't taste good brandy,
you down it.

111
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,585
Crush those Russians!

112
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,094
Look at all those lazy crows.

113
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,425
Where are you going?

114
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:40,715
Get him, Ionita!

115
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,635
Stop or I shoot!

116
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:56,464
Carfin, you fucking bastard!

117
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:03,670
I didn't steal nothing, bright lord.

118
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,711
Back off, crows!

119
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:14,467
He didn't do nothin'!
Don't kill him!

120
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:17,089
Spare him his life!

121
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,085
Stay out, or I'll kill you too!

122
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:25,591
- Is he from your camp?
- He's our Caldasin.

123
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,802
- Why'd you run?
- For fear, bright lord.

124
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,836
- Can you read?
- I can't.

125
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,208
Here!

126
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,093
Don't drop it.

127
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:53,384
"...to you, lawkeeper Costandin sin
Gheorghe, this letter gives all power

128
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:02,091
to catch the Gypsy slave Carfin Pandoleon:

129
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:06,800
tall of stature, dark of face,

130
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:12,835
who also speaks the Gypsy language.

131
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:23,208
This Gypsy fled
from boyar Iordache Candescu

132
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:28,543
and stole money from a box.

133
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:41,543
Should you not bring said slave,
we shall put you in chains

134
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,425
and bring upon you great punishment.
These we write..."

135
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:48,214
Enough.

136
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,924
- Nasty language these crows have.
- Yes.

137
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,548
Fit for devils, not people.

138
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,086
- He only passed by here.
- Where'd he go, then?

139
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,174
Towards Craiova, or to the next county...

140
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,752
When did he leave?

141
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,502
Before sunset, many days ago.

142
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:25,635
If you lie to me,
we'll spill your guts...

143
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,673
I ain't lying, bright lord.

144
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:33,044
Some bear-naming Gypsies passed by,
then your man.

145
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,050
My boys gave him some food
and off he went.

146
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,927
If you've been crowing out lies,

147
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:44,209
we'll come back with the posse
and kill you like sparrows.

148
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,334
Bright lord, here's some gold,
so you won't leave angry.

149
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:00,917
Damn you and your gold!

150
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:12,261
Ionita, this is how
you scare the crows,

151
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,005
if you're a man!

152
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,547
Yes.

153
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,709
A good butcher doesn't fear
thousands of thousands of sheep!

154
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,007
Fucking bad luck!
A priest in skirts.

155
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:01,590
Ten years of misfortune.

156
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,302
- Away, Satan!
- Why do we do that?

157
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:09,216
'Cause devils flock around priests.

158
00:17:10,917 --> 00:17:14,000
What happened, honourable Father?

159
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:19,546
This cursed wheel broke off.

160
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:22,636
Shall we help,
like good Samaritans?

161
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,800
God bless you,
The snakes would have swallowed me alive.

162
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,257
God is glad to see
two poor souls helping each other.

163
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,712
You have an axe there
and all you need.

164
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,801
What are you looking for?

165
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,594
A runaway Gypsy slave
who stole the boyar's money.

166
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:47,044
Damned crow!

167
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,753
I didn't see anyone.
So he ran away?

168
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,333
Yes, Father.
The crows have no shame anymore.

169
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,297
It'll be the end of us

170
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,341
when the ass gets at the head
and the cunt is in command...

171
00:17:58,667 --> 00:17:59,919
True, Father.

172
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,506
I just hope he doesn't run
to the Turks.

173
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:07,127
- What could he do there?
- He could become a mercenary in Nicopolis.

174
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,253
If he does, we've lost him...

175
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,800
Ready, Father.

176
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:17,261
God, bless Thy servants, amen!

177
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,755
Have some holy water.

178
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:23,754
To wash us of our many sins...

179
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:28,050
- Good for you.
- As the Ecclesiastes says:

180
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:32,126
"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do,
do it with thy might;

181
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,917
for there is no work, nor device,
nor knowledge, nor wisdom,

182
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,048
in the grave, where thou goest."

183
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:42,877
Well said, my sons!
Christ did not rise in vain.

184
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:45,010
So help us God!

185
00:18:48,042 --> 00:18:50,215
I'll spend the night
at Manjoala's inn.

186
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:53,465
I never travel in the dark
for fear of outlaws,

187
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:56,545
As for us,
first business, then pleasure:

188
00:18:57,042 --> 00:19:02,674
we'll search
'til the Seven Sisters rise...

189
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:12,380
- Isn't there a holiday coming, Father?
- So it is.

190
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:16,091
Forgive me, Lord!
I hanged You with thread,

191
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:21,176
and not with a gold chain,
like the bishops.

192
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:26,588
But isn't it faith that matters most?

193
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:29,841
Faith, but also deeds!

194
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,798
Another question, if we may?

195
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,125
Sure.

196
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:39,755
- You're more enlightened, you have praxis...
- Sure.

197
00:19:41,042 --> 00:19:45,673
Gypsies, is they people
or Satan's spawn?

198
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:47,714
Some say they ain't human.

199
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:51,376
Human like us.
Aren't they Christians?

200
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:55,216
I myself baptised two slave cubs
recently.

201
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:58,045
- Monastery slaves?
- Right, two chickies.

202
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:03,251
Crows are descendants of Ham,
son of Noah,

203
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,503
cursed by his father to be black.

204
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,678
They came here from Egypt.

205
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,010
They are Egyptians.

206
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,877
- Is that so?
- Yes.

207
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,584
- What do we call crows to mock them?
- Black crows.

208
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,969
There are no white crows.
How else?

209
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,801
Maggots.

210
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,377
- What else?
- Darkies.

211
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:27,046
- Pharaohs.
- Good, Aferim! Pharaohs.

212
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:31,297
'Cause they came here from Egypt,

213
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:35,542
where they were also slaves,
building palaces for the kings.

214
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:40,251
When a wise man opens his mouth,
open your ears!

215
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,757
Gypsies is humans.
Jews ain't, they's beasts.

216
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,547
If you say so...

217
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,835
Now you tell me,
why is Jews not human?

218
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,545
'Cause Jews drinks the blood
of Christian children.

219
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:56,510
The priest told us so in church.

220
00:20:56,708 --> 00:21:01,544
- And why do they?
- We don't know.

221
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,879
- Have you heard of the Giant Jews?
- No.

222
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,006
Shame on you...

223
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:13,253
Before making mankind,
God created the Giant Jews.

224
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,552
Mean, ugly giants.

225
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:19,838
He saw His mistake
and turned them into dust.

226
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:24,793
He left just a few,
then made Adam and Eve.

227
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:30,419
The Giant Jews multiplied,
but grew ever smaller.

228
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:35,801
- They's our Jews nowadays.
- We didn't know that.

229
00:21:36,042 --> 00:21:38,966
That's why Jews
can't stand us Christians,

230
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,552
that's why they killed Christ.

231
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:43,510
And that's why I can't stand them.

232
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,173
- Do you know what I do with pork-haters?
- We don't.

233
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,174
I cut off their beards and sidelocks.

234
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,007
Better a Jew without a beard
than a beard without a Jew!

235
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:55,341
- Do you know what they do in Moldova?
- I don't know..

236
00:21:57,542 --> 00:22:00,796
Jews walk around
in their carriages.

237
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:06,173
And instead of horses,
they use good Christians.

238
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,253
I don't believe it, father.
That's what the Russians did to us.

239
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,334
In the war of 1828,
General Zaltukhin harnessed our peasants.

240
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:18,885
The Christians in my cousin's village
can't bleed themselves,

241
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:22,416
the Jews left no leeches in the lake.

242
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:27,509
But some Jews are baptised
into our Christian faith.

243
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,798
Who would believe those outlaws?

244
00:22:30,042 --> 00:22:33,717
"Who makes up the Devil's flocks?
All the Jews with their sidelacks."

245
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:36,552
Each nation has its purpose.

246
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:40,667
The Jews, to cheat,
the Turks, to do harm,

247
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:45,418
us Romanians to love, honour,
and suffer like good Christians.

248
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:47,339
And each has their habits.

249
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,583
Hebrews reads a lot,
Greeks talks a lot,

250
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:53,591
Turks has many wives,
Arabs has many teeth,

251
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:56,466
Germans smoke a lot.
Hungarians eat a lot,

252
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,461
Russians drink a lot,
English think a lot,

253
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:03,297
French like fashion a lot.
Armenians are lazy,

254
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:09,254
Circasians wear many a lace,
Italians lie a lot,

255
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,255
Serbians cheat a lot
and Gypsies get many a beating.

256
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:17,884
Gypsies must be slaves.
When Ham spread horse shit on Noah,

257
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,927
Noah cursed them to be slaves
and as dark as shit.

258
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,172
That's right.

259
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:25,629
They must be kept on a tight leash.
'Tis a holy commandment.

260
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:29,797
But with kindness.
That is my habit.

261
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,215
Though I'm as harsh as a a hot pepper

262
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:36,302
born of father Garlic
and mother Onion.

263
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,711
I treat people kindly.

264
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,549
The Gospel says
to be as gentle as doves, Father...

265
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:49,674
If the beasts weren't vanquished,
they would tear man apart.

266
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:53,126
Even among people,
most are beasts

267
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:56,879
who must be tamed
to make them work.

268
00:23:57,125 --> 00:24:01,175
- Particularly the crows.
- Lovely thoughts, Father.

269
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,711
We'll head this way.

270
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:17,839
- We wish you good health.
- Good health to bear good grief.

271
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:20,386
Go with God, we may meet again.

272
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,170
The mountains themselves
sometimes meet...

273
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,673
True words.

274
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:11,215
Even a fallen tree rests...

275
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:39,753
It's not true, Ionita.

276
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:44,004
You could walk until you die
and still not touch the end of the Earth.

277
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,590
That's what the priest told us:

278
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:49,177
that the Earth has an edge,
it ain't endless.

279
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:53,710
Those are just a fool's teachings.

280
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:58,835
Father Duhu told us everything
has an end but for God,

281
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:01,420
who has neither beginning,
nor end.

282
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:04,261
Doesn't the Earth have an end?

283
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:07,336
Where it ends,
ain't it like a precipice?

284
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:12,091
I don't know,
'Tain't any of my concern.

285
00:26:13,792 --> 00:26:16,386
I have other worries.

286
00:26:19,542 --> 00:26:21,840
We're nothing, Ionita.

287
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:25,136
Look at the size of this world...

288
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:29,837
...we're like a spark from these embers.

289
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,135
Do you know the seven planets?

290
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,673
The Moon, the Sun...

291
00:26:39,042 --> 00:26:43,673
Bottle, Flask, Pitcher,
Mug, Carafe, Jar, and Stein.

292
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,711
Here I lay and die,
No help by my side.

293
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:59,301
Far as I may seek,
My fate remains bleak.

294
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:04,131
Life of grief and sorrow,
No hope for tomorrow.

295
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:11,296
Some have luck, fortune and fame.
Some burn like the candle's flame!

296
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:15,548
What's gotten into you?

297
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:43,878
Do you like Aspra?

298
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:46,460
She's a hard-working girl...

299
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:49,382
How could I like that slob?

300
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:54,760
- You know, as a girl.
- Nah, I don't like her.

301
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:57,636
- You're not a Sodomite, are you?
- What's that?

302
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:59,631
Liking men, not women...

303
00:27:59,792 --> 00:28:01,419
- No such thing.
- 'Cause if you are,

304
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:04,011
I'll drown you with my own hands.

305
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,500
What's that?

306
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,005
The haidouks!

307
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,797
Or the savage Gypsies.

308
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:29,963
There's also bullet wounds.
It was the haidouks.

309
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,465
Let's make way.

310
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:39,590
- Father...
- Keep that mouth shut!

311
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:44,211
- One was breathing.
- Sure he was.

312
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,334
- He moved just now.
- What are we, surgeons?

313
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:52,298
May he rest in peace.

314
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:06,128
We're safe.

315
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:10,251
Fear is shameful, but healthy.
It's God's gift.

316
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:54,042
You whore's son,
watch where you're going!

317
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:58,376
Is this your own path?
Stay the hell in a row!

318
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:02,462
- Fuck your mother!
- Find a dog to fuck you, moron!

319
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:08,755
The rich man is like a hare,
he leaps wherever he wants to.

320
00:30:09,292 --> 00:30:11,670
Maybe a big landowner
or a Greek boyar.

321
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,128
Still, he should watch
where he's going.

322
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:16,881
That's our fate as Romanians!

323
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:20,629
Whoever rises earliest
can drag you by your hair.

324
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:25,508
May he live three more days,
counting yesterday!

325
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:39,174
So pretty!

326
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:42,844
Fuck your prettiness!

327
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:15,969
- Peace to you, good fellow.
- Good day.

328
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,879
We're looking for a runaway crow,
a Gypsy slave.

329
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:22,381
I'm a peasant here,
but I ain't seen nobody.

330
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:24,047
You ain't gonna find him.

331
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:28,380
Like they didn't find the runaways
from our monastery.

332
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:30,801
Would you sell us some fish?

333
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:32,339
Why not?

334
00:31:34,917 --> 00:31:37,420
Maybe he's in the forest,
with the gold panners.

335
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:39,844
- He ain't.
- Then I don't know, constable.

336
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:42,719
But the monks
would have seen him here.

337
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:47,335
I think so too. Is there
a way across through the reeds?

338
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:50,219
- They's too thick.
- What if we go around?

339
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:51,630
- Two days.
- Too long.

340
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:53,506
Look at this!

341
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:58,048
Constable, the money?

342
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,128
That's very little, constable.

343
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,344
It ain't worth more.

344
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:14,799
Come on... constable...

345
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:27,344
We can cross,
the water is shallow.

346
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:37,220
Curse this wretched craft!

347
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,378
Crawling along,
mocked by everyone.

348
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,594
This is a dog's life.

349
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:50,876
We sweat like beasts
for a piece of bread.

350
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:58,469
If I had the luck of joining
this new army...

351
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:03,171
- Won't they take you in now?
- No, curse them...

352
00:33:06,042 --> 00:33:09,967
But if you learn all the tricks
of the constable job from me,

353
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:15,133
I'll get you into the army.

354
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:17,760
Let's go back, we can't pass.

355
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,594
By thirty you'll be a colonel.

356
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,469
You're full of tire and fierce.

357
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,423
- But you're also lazy...
- No, I ain't.

358
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:33,005
You have to be quick like gunpowder.

359
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:59,424
Who are you?

360
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:03,467
I'm lawkeeper Costandin sin Gheorghe.
He's my boy, he helps me.

361
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,085
What's your business here?

362
00:34:05,292 --> 00:34:08,421
- We're looking for a runaway Gypsy.
- What Gypsy?

363
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:10,468
Carfin, a slave
who stole from the boyar.

364
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,252
Where's your mandate?

365
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:19,417
No good, it's not from our ruler.

366
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:22,219
I didn't find the Gypsy
in my county...

367
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:25,834
This is Dumbrava county.
I give the orders here.

368
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:30,302
You get me a mandate,
and I'll seek him for you.

369
00:34:30,542 --> 00:34:34,718
- What if I get one from your ruler?
- We'll see then.

370
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:38,170
Come on, we're two good lawmen...

371
00:34:40,292 --> 00:34:41,384
Go back!

372
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:43,423
- Come over here.
- What for?

373
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,343
Let's have a word.

374
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,425
- What would it take for us to agree?
- You say.

375
00:34:56,625 --> 00:35:00,004
I give you two thalers
and you let me look for him.

376
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:02,840
These are hard times, bey-mu...

377
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:06,501
The Russians struck at us, too...

378
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,047
How much, then?

379
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:13,336
Four thalers, and I'll even tell you
where the crows hiding.

380
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:18,342
- Where is he, then?
- Money first, bey-mu.

381
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,217
Four.

382
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:34,670
He's in the house of an ugly man,
Stan sin Paraschiv by name.

383
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,594
- He's a basket weaver.
- How do I find him?

384
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:41,926
Go back, past some hovels,

385
00:35:42,292 --> 00:35:46,468
then you'll see a house by the pond.

386
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:50,383
Thanks a-plenty.
We're sick of chasing this crow.

387
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,377
I'm also sick and coughing...

388
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:56,592
- No scandal, bey-mu.
- 'Pon my honour! I'm a constable too!

389
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:59,086
You haven't heard it from me.

390
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:02,345
If we don't know
the miserable life we lead, who does?

391
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:07,588
- I'm in your debt.
- If you need anything else, ask for me.

392
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,798
Many thanks.

393
00:36:47,917 --> 00:36:50,386
Go see why that hag ran off.

394
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:16,552
I'll crack your head open
with my yatagan.

395
00:37:16,917 --> 00:37:18,635
There's nothing here.

396
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:21,210
Get the hell away!

397
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,548
A constable is here!

398
00:37:55,542 --> 00:37:57,340
Bright lords, what is your need?

399
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,209
Good day, aunt,
we're looking for Stan sin Paraschiv.

400
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:03,511
- What for?
- We have a word with him.

401
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:05,460
- What word?
- A joke.

402
00:38:06,292 --> 00:38:08,590
It's jokes that get you fornicating.

403
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:11,586
Oi, you're crushing me!

404
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,294
What are you looking for?

405
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:34,085
You're mining our reed!

406
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,844
Good man Stan
Burned down the barn...

407
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:43,132
What do you want with me, constable?

408
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:45,127
I am lawkeeper Costandin sin Gheorghe.

409
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:48,416
We're here to seize Carfin,
the Gypsy slave in your house.

410
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,252
Here's our mandate.

411
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:52,880
He's my son.

412
00:38:56,583 --> 00:39:00,042
I can't afford Gypsies.
What am I, a boyar?

413
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:03,917
We break our backs
working for nothing.

414
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,344
- How could we own Gypsies?
- We know he's here.

415
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,502
- Who?
- The crow.

416
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:12,383
- What crow?
- Boyar Candescu's Gypsy.

417
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:15,591
We have no such boyar around here.

418
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:18,416
He's playing the idiot,
isn't he, Ionita?

419
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:19,418
He is.

420
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:21,590
- Me, playing the idiot?
- Yes.

421
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,886
- Me, having a Gypsy here?
- Yes.

422
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:29,002
I tell him I'm a nun
and he takes off my habit..

423
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:31,631
- I don't have any!
- Yes, you do.

424
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:35,425
Good Lord, where is he, then?

425
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:37,047
Wherever you hid him.

426
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,761
Should I put
the Lord's whip on your back?!

427
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:43,917
Do you see any Gypsy?
A pig it's all we have.

428
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:48,551
No Gypsy!
This is a poor household.

429
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:51,549
It doesn't look that poor.

430
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:56,793
We're dirt poor,
we only have the skin on our backs.

431
00:39:58,083 --> 00:40:00,757
You still have the fortune
between your legs!

432
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:02,756
Bless you!

433
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,629
Diddle, diddle, the cat and the fiddle!

434
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,628
Let's play piggy in the middle!

435
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:15,631
Just a little neighbourhood crow.

436
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:17,627
Let's search some more.

437
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:35,219
See? No one here.

438
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:41,003
My daughter-in-law,
old Grandpa on his deathbed.

439
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:44,010
Woman, bring a candle!

440
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:48,007
- What's here?
- Never seen an attic before?

441
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:54,503
Where we keep our baskets,
beans, onion...

442
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:59,798
Where do you think you're climbing?

443
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:04,169
Are you hitting a lawkeeper?

444
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:16,545
He's killed me!

445
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:30,176
Father!

446
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:33,551
He's killin' me!

447
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:50,886
Let him go!

448
00:41:56,792 --> 00:41:58,920
I'll buy him from you!

449
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,631
Help, they's killin' me!

450
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:32,423
Stay away or I shoot!

451
00:42:35,542 --> 00:42:39,501
It ain't me. Let me go!

452
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:46,300
Let him go, he's Stan's slave!

453
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:04,631
- Where are you from, blackie?
- Master Iancu the merchant.

454
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:09,634
- Ran away from there?
- Yes, master, 'cause he beat me bad.

455
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:17,171
And he stabbed my brother to death
when he was drunk.

456
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:20,090
I got scared and I ran.

457
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:22,586
- What's your name?
- Tintiric, master.

458
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,677
- How old are you?
- How should I know?

459
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:28,507
- Hasn't anyone told you?
- No, master.

460
00:43:28,792 --> 00:43:31,261
Stop shaking like a hag's teeth,
are you scared?

461
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:33,260
Yes, master.

462
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:39,301
Shut up!

463
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:40,801
What's the matter?

464
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,924
- This shitskin wanted to flee.
- I didn't.

465
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:46,753
- You wanted to jump off.
- I didn't.

466
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:52,469
We're taking him back, the merchant
might thank us with a dime or two.

467
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:54,551
Don't take me back!

468
00:43:54,792 --> 00:43:56,794
Upon my life, master.
He'll beat me!

469
00:43:57,083 --> 00:43:59,711
Shut up, little prince,
or I'll smack you.

470
00:43:59,712 --> 00:44:02,302
Father, he's just a poor soul!

471
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:05,917
A devil's soul...
But the devil can bring in money, too.

472
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:07,960
Right.

473
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:12,254
- We know your kind.
- You all say you didn't steal.

474
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:13,926
I didn't, kind lord...

475
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:17,417
Why did you flee, then?

476
00:44:17,792 --> 00:44:19,089
Is it better now?

477
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:23,050
Don't turn me over
to the boyar, master.

478
00:44:23,917 --> 00:44:26,636
He'll kill me.
Take me as your slave.

479
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:30,171
I'll do all you say,
just don't take me back.

480
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:32,210
- He won't kill you...
- Yes he will.

481
00:44:32,417 --> 00:44:34,886
Fish brains in a rabbit's head...

482
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:39,133
He'll give you a beating
and send you back to work.

483
00:44:39,542 --> 00:44:42,341
Where a boyar strikes, new skin grows.

484
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:44,147
- Ain't that right, Tintiric?
- Right.

485
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:47,051
On our street,

486
00:44:47,292 --> 00:44:50,421
a trader buried a man alive
and the man died.

487
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:53,587
- What trader?
- Kir Costea.

488
00:44:55,667 --> 00:44:58,921
He buried a man alive,
many people saw.

489
00:44:59,125 --> 00:45:00,593
What had he done?

490
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:05,049
No one told me.

491
00:45:05,667 --> 00:45:09,877
At least if I were guilty.
But I ain't.

492
00:45:10,042 --> 00:45:12,511
Who else could be guilty? Me?

493
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:14,923
His wife pushed me to fuck her.

494
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:19,880
Hear that, Ionita, the crow claims
he fucked the boyar's woman.

495
00:45:21,667 --> 00:45:24,386
Swear upon the devil's cod,
upon Aaron's rod,

496
00:45:24,387 --> 00:45:25,749
so help you God!

497
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,797
I swear.

498
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,844
So how'd she push you, crow?

499
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:37,210
She had her eyes set on me
since they had bought me.

500
00:45:37,917 --> 00:45:40,545
But I couldn't believe...

501
00:45:40,792 --> 00:45:43,716
One day,
I was watering the horses...

502
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:48,593
She came quietly into the stables,

503
00:45:48,917 --> 00:45:53,343
she climbed on top of me
and rubbed her cunt against my nape.

504
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:57,838
The old hen
ain't scared of a thick cock!

505
00:45:58,042 --> 00:46:03,754
- So you didn't like it?
- I did, aren't I a man?

506
00:46:04,917 --> 00:46:07,466
The things I did to her...

507
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:11,251
And if I hadn't liked it?
She's my mistress.

508
00:46:11,458 --> 00:46:14,962
Then why'd you run
from such grief, crow?

509
00:46:16,417 --> 00:46:19,626
The stable boy found out
and told the boyar,

510
00:46:19,958 --> 00:46:24,008
who said he'd kill me...
I ran for my life.

511
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:27,757
- He's making it up!
- I'm not, good master...

512
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:31,254
I've heard about
the lady's fornication,

513
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:34,512
even with her cousin.

514
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,924
They even say she bore his child.

515
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:41,629
I knew from the start
this wasn't a clear business.

516
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:43,718
What did I say?

517
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:48,543
Two turtledoves
in sweet love's fires, eh?

518
00:46:48,792 --> 00:46:50,294
Who had time for that...

519
00:47:02,042 --> 00:47:04,841
Curse them Turks.

520
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:20,503
How to get to Licheresti?
I know.

521
00:47:34,417 --> 00:47:36,511
Mind your words!

522
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:16,961
He's my boy, he helps me.

523
00:48:20,792 --> 00:48:23,215
He wants to give you a gift.

524
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:30,210
Say tesekkur.

525
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:34,085
I want some.

526
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:40,475
- What'd he want?
- To get to Licheresti.

527
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:43,546
- I sent the fool the other way.
- Aferim, father!

528
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:48,384
I hate the Ottomans.
The filthiest nation on Earth.

529
00:48:50,208 --> 00:48:52,051
He talked to me like I was shit.

530
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:54,252
Said he was afraid of the haidouks...

531
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:57,883
I hope our Romanian boys
catch him and tan his skin.

532
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:01,468
They should.

533
00:49:01,917 --> 00:49:04,636
You can tell from their talk
that they's nothin' but beasts.

534
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:08,125
- Give me some.
- Fine, have some.

535
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:10,753
We work like morons
for them and the boyars...

536
00:49:16,292 --> 00:49:17,669
It's closer...

537
00:49:17,917 --> 00:49:21,626
We can do some good business,
without wasting lime.

538
00:49:26,792 --> 00:49:29,136
Look what I found for you, cricket.

539
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:32,379
You can find ripe fruit
under the driest leaf.

540
00:49:34,042 --> 00:49:35,885
Master, don't take me back!

541
00:49:36,083 --> 00:49:38,211
Bey-mu, what can I do?

542
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,253
Clap my hands
and make you a divan-efiendi?

543
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:42,880
Take me to your home!

544
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:46,007
I can wow the fields, cook...

545
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:48,131
I don't need that.
I have a wife.

546
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:51,007
- Have pity, bright lord.
- Be thankful I don't beat you.

547
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:53,920
I give you a finger,
don't ask for the whole hand.

548
00:49:59,667 --> 00:50:01,510
You struck bad luck.

549
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:05,675
- But I had my good days too.
- When?

550
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:08,461
When I was a slave for
his highness Bibescu.

551
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:10,502
Then, when he died,

552
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:13,837
for his highness Manu
and Lady Smaranda Vacarescu.

553
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:17,049
- Lies, Gypsy.
- I swear!

554
00:50:17,292 --> 00:50:19,386
I was looking after the horses...

555
00:50:19,542 --> 00:50:23,172
I even went with him to Paris,
to Leipzig. To Vienna, too...

556
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:25,882
I've seen the world.

557
00:50:26,042 --> 00:50:30,047
- Did you fuck Lady Smaranda, too?
- No way!

558
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:33,460
She hardly even looked at us Gypsies,

559
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:36,750
she only talked with her sly cranes...

560
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:41,042
So, how does lady Sultana
go when she fucks?

561
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,844
Does she moan and move?

562
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:48,086
She moves her big buttocks hard.

563
00:50:48,292 --> 00:50:50,966
She doesn't moan,
for fear someone might hear...

564
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:53,173
And she whispered in my ear:

565
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:58,840
"Psihi-mu, I like your cock so!
Stick it deeper!"

566
00:51:00,917 --> 00:51:04,251
And after I let myself go,

567
00:51:06,917 --> 00:51:08,544
she'd whisper:

568
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:14,297
- "Mashallah, Gypsy!"
- I see...

569
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:18,177
So how's the world?

570
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:23,629
Big and beautiful...
Not like here.

571
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:26,586
He knows his stuff!

572
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,760
So, what's it like in Vienna?

573
00:51:28,917 --> 00:51:31,841
I've never left our county
except for father's work.

574
00:51:34,417 --> 00:51:36,545
I don't know what to say...

575
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:40,505
Like three of our towns,
only with palaces.

576
00:51:40,792 --> 00:51:45,002
- How 'bout Leipzig?
- Smaller. But prettier than anything here.

577
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:51,504
- And Paris?
- Big, like ten Viennas...

578
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:57,380
Cobbled roads,
countless princesses.

579
00:51:58,375 --> 00:52:01,094
- And they don't beat their servants.
- Lies!

580
00:52:01,292 --> 00:52:03,636
It ain't lies!

581
00:52:14,667 --> 00:52:20,049
When lady Manu
married that dumb Russian prince.

582
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:26,552
She asked as dowry
for a Vienna carriage.

583
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:32,926
In exchange we, thirty souls of Gypsies,
were given to boyar Filipescu.

584
00:52:33,542 --> 00:52:37,092
The beatings we got there
with ox sinews...

585
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,755
Three months ago,
master Filipescu auctioned away

586
00:52:42,208 --> 00:52:45,462
some five hundred Gypsy souls.

587
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:53,425
Master Candescu bought me from him.
I asked him to buy my family too...

588
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:56,754
We have no concern with your life...

589
00:52:56,958 --> 00:52:59,962
We're hardworking...

590
00:53:28,917 --> 00:53:31,170
Make way!

591
00:53:35,833 --> 00:53:39,918
- What's this?
- Vasilache and Marrbara.

592
00:53:44,292 --> 00:53:48,126
I'm a man, not a mouse.

593
00:53:50,792 --> 00:53:54,626
Take this, if you're a man!

594
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:02,927
'Tis like they's real men.

595
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:07,676
No, you dimwit, they's dolls,
with people moving them!

596
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,344
Crack the stupid bitch's head!

597
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:21,593
Will you be quiet now?

598
00:54:22,042 --> 00:54:26,252
Now she's upset.
Get up, Marioara!

599
00:54:26,458 --> 00:54:31,259
- Fuck her!
- Shut up! She's dead!

600
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:34,295
The priest!

601
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,673
Let's give her a funeral!

602
00:54:38,292 --> 00:54:40,260
What funeral? You're drunk!

603
00:54:40,667 --> 00:54:43,420
Go to hell with your Marioara!

604
00:54:48,458 --> 00:54:51,962
Look at him beating that priest!

605
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:04,962
Whosoever buys us,
we will be slaves to his house,

606
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:11,712
we and our offspring,
just save us from hunger...

607
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,300
Back off, everyone!

608
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:24,051
Take pity on me, master!

609
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:26,586
Didn't you say you don't want
to go back to the merchant?

610
00:55:26,792 --> 00:55:28,044
Who will buy me?

611
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:30,924
I might end up with one
who will beat me to death.

612
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:33,503
We'll find you a good man.

613
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:36,261
- We won't give you to just anyone.
- Good, then...

614
00:55:42,542 --> 00:55:48,800
Buy me, honourable lords!
I'm a hardworking, obedient slave!

615
00:56:00,583 --> 00:56:04,008
- Is the small darkie for sale?
- For sale he is.

616
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:07,711
Take us, master!
We are freed slaves.

617
00:56:07,917 --> 00:56:09,510
- How many of you?
- A clan.

618
00:56:09,708 --> 00:56:10,880
Back off!

619
00:56:12,667 --> 00:56:15,671
- How much?
- Almost nothing. Ten piastres.

620
00:56:16,042 --> 00:56:19,251
Expensive!
For that I can buy two big ones.

621
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:22,296
This is the price of the market.
I know the worth of a slave...

622
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,969
Let me see your beak, crow.

623
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:33,750
- Doesn't even have all his teeth.
- Bey-mu, they'll grow. He's a child.

624
00:56:34,542 --> 00:56:37,625
- Thin as a rake, too.
- No, he has iron bones.

625
00:56:37,875 --> 00:56:40,503
He's sturdy stock.

626
00:56:42,542 --> 00:56:44,260
- Come to the scalesmaster.
- What for?

627
00:56:44,542 --> 00:56:47,261
To see how much he weighs.

628
00:56:47,625 --> 00:56:48,717
- Where is he?
- There.

629
00:56:48,958 --> 00:56:50,631
Where are you taking me, master?

630
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,879
Buy us, bright lords!

631
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:01,337
- Three stone and a half.
- See, he's in excellent condition.

632
00:57:07,375 --> 00:57:10,424
I want to give him to our holy church.

633
00:57:10,667 --> 00:57:13,921
- Drop it three piastres.
- No more than one.

634
00:57:14,167 --> 00:57:15,714
Do you have papers?
Or is he stolen?

635
00:57:15,875 --> 00:57:19,300
No one will find him.
I'm a lawkeeper.

636
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:21,756
Without papers, four piastres.

637
00:57:21,958 --> 00:57:24,177
What is he, a chicken?
He's a slave!

638
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,878
Let's see who will give you more.

639
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:28,968
At least five.

640
00:57:30,292 --> 00:57:32,761
- Deal.
- Don't give me away, master!

641
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:41,844
They're not forged, are they?

642
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:45,628
- How much for the one on the horse?
- Two piastres.

643
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:48,131
He's not for sale.

644
00:57:48,917 --> 00:57:51,887
A pity, he was a good one.
Come on, crow!

645
00:57:53,583 --> 00:57:55,210
Good luck, Tintiric!

646
00:57:55,542 --> 00:57:58,011
What are you meddling for?

647
00:58:02,542 --> 00:58:05,916
Father! Come on up!

648
00:58:05,917 --> 00:58:08,295
No, it's not for me.

649
00:58:09,292 --> 00:58:10,292
Come on!

650
00:58:10,542 --> 00:58:13,512
- Is that good?
- Yes!

651
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:30,548
Amazing!

652
00:58:38,417 --> 00:58:40,886
Money wasted...

653
00:58:58,917 --> 00:59:01,761
What can I do, Carfin?
You made your own bed.

654
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,174
Have pity, constable, set me free!
Ionita!

655
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:08,052
I can't deceive the boyar...

656
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:12,792
But I'll tell him
how that bitch jumped you...

657
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:18,089
He will lock her up in some convent.

658
00:59:18,292 --> 00:59:22,251
So what? He'll still kill me.

659
00:59:23,542 --> 00:59:26,045
Enough whining, he won't kill you.

660
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:31,005
I'll ask him to just beat you a little.

661
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:35,544
He'll kill me, master!

662
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:09,922
- Will you buy me some sweets?
- No money for that.

663
01:00:10,667 --> 01:00:12,635
Come on, crow!

664
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:18,551
How much to sleep here?

665
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:22,050
Twenty for a man,
five for a horse.

666
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:26,509
Bring us ham
and some cheap wine.

667
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,209
A starving dog
dreams of nothing but bones.

668
01:00:31,375 --> 01:00:35,334
- Lica ate, drank, and didn't pay.
- Never mind.

669
01:00:36,542 --> 01:00:37,543
What did that crow do?

670
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,002
Ran away from a boyar.

671
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,843
If he was my crow,

672
01:00:42,292 --> 01:00:46,798
I'd have blinded him
and cut off his legs.

673
01:00:50,667 --> 01:00:51,759
Go to hell!

674
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:55,335
Dig in.

675
01:00:55,958 --> 01:00:59,883
The rich look in the mirror,
the poor, in their plate.

676
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,002
Damn good.

677
01:01:05,792 --> 01:01:07,044
You're badly ill, father.

678
01:01:07,292 --> 01:01:10,216
I have this nixis in my chest.

679
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:14,463
My teeth rattle,
the shovel is waiting...

680
01:01:15,292 --> 01:01:17,420
How about the doctors in Bucharest?

681
01:01:17,625 --> 01:01:20,299
It's your turn to live, Ionita...

682
01:01:20,625 --> 01:01:24,425
Feels like yesterday I was sewing
under bailiff Vladimirescu.

683
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:27,629
What a life, fuck...

684
01:01:29,708 --> 01:01:32,211
Sing louder, crow!

685
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:36,924
I was storming women away
during the uprising.

686
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:42,427
We would enter a village,
kill their cattle and party wildly...

687
01:01:44,917 --> 01:01:48,251
- When was that?
- Around 1821. You were a babe.

688
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,798
You know what our song was?

689
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:54,508
Seven vales and seven hills,
Fuck the boyars to the gills.

690
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:58,459
Soon I'll catch you by the mane,
Mash you bloody with my cane...

691
01:02:22,042 --> 01:02:27,299
We were feared,
we killed them like pigs.

692
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:31,167
We were as wild as leopards.

693
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,049
I was a mercenary...

694
01:02:35,458 --> 01:02:40,385
I had a cunt in every village.
Don't tell your mother!

695
01:02:40,583 --> 01:02:43,006
- Sure.
- You're a big boy now.

696
01:02:43,583 --> 01:02:46,336
You know how crazy she gets.

697
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,753
My life's all done...

698
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:57,964
All our lives flow like a stream,

699
01:02:58,417 --> 01:03:01,796
It all passes like a dream.

700
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:04,377
Eat some!

701
01:03:06,958 --> 01:03:10,883
The good stuff passed like the wind.

702
01:03:13,875 --> 01:03:17,004
- Want a drop of wine?
- Sure!

703
01:03:27,375 --> 01:03:32,802
While drunk, don't give gifts,
nor do harm.

704
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:38,088
If you do want to give,
then give while sober.

705
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:59,011
Hey, innkeeper!

706
01:03:59,375 --> 01:04:01,298
Bring us a whore.

707
01:04:01,542 --> 01:04:02,885
Right away.

708
01:04:03,167 --> 01:04:05,841
Zambila, get over here!

709
01:04:06,083 --> 01:04:09,007
I don't want no Gypsy.
I want a clean woman!

710
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,844
Clean she is, man.

711
01:04:12,083 --> 01:04:15,383
Take my son
and do what you know best.

712
01:04:15,625 --> 01:04:17,093
I will.

713
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:20,927
Innkeeper! I want this pretty one!

714
01:04:21,167 --> 01:04:24,717
Oi, that's my wife. Let go!

715
01:04:24,917 --> 01:04:28,046
- You got the French disease?
- Of course not.

716
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:30,719
- What's your name?
- Zambila.

717
01:04:30,875 --> 01:04:33,094
- How much for you?
- Fifteen.

718
01:04:33,333 --> 01:04:35,006
That's a lot.

719
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:39,419
Come with me!

720
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:42,090
Don't embarrass me, lad.

721
01:05:00,708 --> 01:05:03,632
He's not a bad boy,
but he's girlish,

722
01:05:03,958 --> 01:05:06,006
his mother's too soft with him.

723
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:08,878
He's not very respectful...

724
01:05:09,083 --> 01:05:10,460
He's a good lad.

725
01:05:10,625 --> 01:05:13,128
That's how I'd like
my children to be,

726
01:05:13,333 --> 01:05:15,631
- You got children, Carfin?
- No.

727
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:18,211
Maybe next year,
if my wife doesn't die.

728
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:23,711
You came here from England
to teach us your fuckin' ethics?

729
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:27,542
What's that idiot say?

730
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:33,302
You, go away!

731
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:39,551
Dumb outlanders!

732
01:05:39,958 --> 01:05:43,588
- How's 'bout playing an otuzbir with us?
- No.

733
01:05:43,833 --> 01:05:46,677
- Then five dime for one?
- I don't have money.

734
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:50,633
- Then spit on us and let us be.
- Spit on you?

735
01:05:51,042 --> 01:05:53,886
I could trim you with this sword.

736
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:57,166
It's a saying from Targoviste, you know?

737
01:05:57,542 --> 01:06:00,796
Small town, great poverty!

738
01:06:01,042 --> 01:06:03,090
True, constable.

739
01:06:03,333 --> 01:06:06,132
They say two youngsters
went to get married.

740
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:10,084
But the priest read them
the last rites instead.

741
01:06:11,417 --> 01:06:13,169
Then the baptism rites.

742
01:06:13,958 --> 01:06:16,882
When he was supposed
to blow over them,

743
01:06:17,458 --> 01:06:21,838
the youngsters,
disgusted with his stupidity, said:

744
01:06:22,917 --> 01:06:30,460
"After such a mess,
better spit on us and let us be."

745
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:37,168
Stupid priest!
Spit on us and let us be.

746
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:01,381
Aferim, Ionita!

747
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:05,087
For a sweet thing like a kiss,
There's no penance from the priest.

748
01:07:05,292 --> 01:07:07,761
- Right, Father?
- Yes, son.

749
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,970
- Keep your eye on him.
- Sure.

750
01:07:11,208 --> 01:07:14,667
- How did it go?
- He's strong like a bull.

751
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:16,835
Well done!

752
01:07:19,917 --> 01:07:23,876
You're not all that strong-built.
Were you hatched from an egg?

753
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:26,006
What can I do?

754
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:28,794
Hey, you'll set me on fire.

755
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:38,006
Tight of cunt and hard of butt,
Makes the cock crack like a nut...

756
01:07:38,333 --> 01:07:42,509
We'll repent when we're old.

757
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:43,958
Father...

758
01:07:45,333 --> 01:07:47,461
- I'm coming with you.
- Better not.

759
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:49,878
There's room for more!

760
01:08:25,417 --> 01:08:28,466
Don't know what's wrong with me.

761
01:08:30,125 --> 01:08:32,924
I got a burn in my cock...

762
01:08:36,917 --> 01:08:40,922
I feel sorry for you,
but give me the money.

763
01:08:41,375 --> 01:08:44,458
- I didn't?
- Only for the boy.

764
01:08:44,917 --> 01:08:49,798
Don't scream like a frog
in the snake's mouth, I'll pay.

765
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:06,003
Bite it, crow!

766
01:09:12,542 --> 01:09:14,044
Don't make a fool out of me!

767
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:16,051
What's this?

768
01:09:16,292 --> 01:09:18,715
He has to take the dime
from the fire.

769
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:32,590
Not with your hand.

770
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:36,335
Take it now!

771
01:09:45,167 --> 01:09:46,794
Oh, shut up.

772
01:10:09,708 --> 01:10:12,211
Alas, poor me!

773
01:10:20,125 --> 01:10:22,219
Who has a stick?

774
01:10:22,667 --> 01:10:26,717
- What for?
- These damn rats.

775
01:10:28,417 --> 01:10:30,670
They's everywhere.

776
01:10:34,292 --> 01:10:37,216
And enough lice to shovel them.

777
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:41,754
A cricket's chirping under my head.

778
01:10:42,292 --> 01:10:44,294
Chirp back, then.

779
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:48,257
Turn with your head this way.

780
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:20,094
- Father.
- What?

781
01:11:20,792 --> 01:11:23,386
Can't we just let him go?

782
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:29,255
- Who?
- Carfin. He ain't guilty.

783
01:11:31,667 --> 01:11:34,967
The country's torn apart with prongs
And the cunt sings merry songs...

784
01:11:35,417 --> 01:11:38,626
What are you, a dean?

785
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:45,466
Just thinkin', why should he be punished
if he ain't guilty...

786
01:11:45,958 --> 01:11:48,757
Enough with this old maid's dream.

787
01:11:49,042 --> 01:11:54,799
Our job is to catch runaways,
and we caught him.

788
01:11:56,208 --> 01:12:00,042
From here on, there's laws,
rules, 'tis not for us to pry.

789
01:12:00,667 --> 01:12:03,386
But you're a constable...

790
01:12:03,958 --> 01:12:07,167
So what?
The law's for everyone.

791
01:12:07,542 --> 01:12:10,751
We must all follow it.

792
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:17,756
I've been honest all my life.
Done my job lawfully.

793
01:12:27,417 --> 01:12:31,092
This world's full of evildoers, Ionita.

794
01:12:31,333 --> 01:12:35,793
I've seen some
freeing locked up thieves at night

795
01:12:36,167 --> 01:12:42,425
so they could steal horses and cows,
then locking them back in...

796
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:49,885
And they shared the loot.
I don't do such deeds.

797
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,710
I know.

798
01:12:54,167 --> 01:12:58,047
And I haven't been mean to folks
like other constables.

799
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:04,094
- I never beat a soul for nothing.
- I know.

800
01:13:04,375 --> 01:13:06,503
I've always been fair.

801
01:13:06,708 --> 01:13:12,670
If we weren't fair either,
our country would go straight to Hell.

802
01:13:13,375 --> 01:13:18,211
But I ain't never been black-hearted.

803
01:13:18,917 --> 01:13:22,467
I know.
What if we said we couldn't find him?

804
01:13:24,583 --> 01:13:29,885
Want us to be everyone's laughingstock
and not get a single dime?

805
01:13:32,083 --> 01:13:35,212
You can't feed the wolf
and save your lambs.

806
01:13:36,917 --> 01:13:40,626
Cursed whore's sons,
shut those mouths!

807
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:46,669
Come on, let's sleep.
Sleep keeps hunger away.

808
01:14:02,208 --> 01:14:04,677
My head hurts bad.

809
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,503
Let me ward off the evil eye from him.

810
01:14:08,167 --> 01:14:09,760
Go ahead, Carfin.

811
01:14:09,958 --> 01:14:13,258
He didn't drink much.
I drank like a sow.

812
01:14:13,458 --> 01:14:14,675
I'm still hazy...

813
01:14:14,833 --> 01:14:17,916
Come over here, Ionita!
I won't eat you!

814
01:14:20,667 --> 01:14:23,295
All ache and ail,
leave the inside of the head,

815
01:14:23,833 --> 01:14:26,086
the hearing of the ears...

816
01:14:45,625 --> 01:14:48,003
Shake yourself, Ionita!

817
01:14:48,625 --> 01:14:50,923
It'll pass, little master,
you'll see.

818
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:56,302
O treacherous world,
first sweet, then bitter...

819
01:15:22,083 --> 01:15:25,007
When the rogues don't
set the woods on fire,

820
01:15:25,292 --> 01:15:27,420
we cut them all to the ground.

821
01:15:27,792 --> 01:15:30,591
Wallachia's forests
are cracking under the axe...

822
01:15:31,458 --> 01:15:34,507
Good country, bad ruling!

823
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:42,043
I wonder, Ionita,
a few hundred years from now,

824
01:15:42,292 --> 01:15:45,876
d'you think folks will say
a good word about us?

825
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:50,710
I don't know, father.

826
01:15:54,292 --> 01:15:57,216
I think they won't say a thing.

827
01:15:57,625 --> 01:16:02,051
They won't think that
we smoothed their path in life.

828
01:16:02,542 --> 01:16:06,672
Or they'll only curse our souls to hell.

829
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:12,042
Gone the day, gone the night...

830
01:16:26,542 --> 01:16:28,795
Ease up, constable.

831
01:16:37,792 --> 01:16:40,966
In two long hours we're home.

832
01:16:41,417 --> 01:16:43,590
We'll get there by dusk.

833
01:16:55,958 --> 01:16:59,758
Alas, unjust death
and cheating world!

834
01:17:00,292 --> 01:17:04,468
You bring people comfort,
then bury them.

835
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:42,543
Alexander the Great studied with
a great philosopher, Aristoteies.

836
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:47,710
He taught him all the Psalms.

837
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,255
All the worthy men wondered
at how fast he learned.

838
01:17:55,208 --> 01:17:58,508
What, Carfin,
do you feel the noose tightening?

839
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,965
He'll kill me, master.

840
01:18:01,167 --> 01:18:03,295
I beg of you
like I beg the Holy Virgin,

841
01:18:03,542 --> 01:18:05,590
put a word in for me with the boyar!

842
01:18:05,792 --> 01:18:10,172
I swear I'll show him
you couldn't help it.

843
01:18:11,167 --> 01:18:14,341
I've been a constable
for many years, I have his ear.

844
01:18:14,708 --> 01:18:17,917
- May the Lord give you health!
- Same to all of us.

845
01:18:18,458 --> 01:18:20,552
If he wants to harm you.
I won't let him.

846
01:18:20,792 --> 01:18:23,136
Some whipping, that's all.

847
01:18:23,417 --> 01:18:27,752
- That's bad too.
- 'Tis no pleasure, but it passes.

848
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:30,381
All goes away,
Like the rain in May.

849
01:18:32,417 --> 01:18:33,418
What?

850
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:35,635
Or he'll choke me to death

851
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:38,302
with hot pepper smoke,
fuck his black soul...

852
01:18:38,833 --> 01:18:44,294
If you put in a word,
I won't ever do another bad deed.

853
01:18:44,833 --> 01:18:47,677
And if you need something,
I'll help you.

854
01:18:48,042 --> 01:18:49,919
Our Carfin eats humble pie...

855
01:18:53,208 --> 01:18:56,883
But in the ass of the humble
the Devil sits cross-legged...

856
01:18:57,417 --> 01:18:59,385
My shot wounds are hurting...

857
01:18:59,625 --> 01:19:03,710
Stop pouting like a duck,
they ain't but cat scratches...

858
01:19:04,208 --> 01:19:08,167
'Twas your own doing
for hiding from us...

859
01:19:12,292 --> 01:19:15,341
You have a good life nowadays.

860
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:18,503
- Who?
- You Gypsies.

861
01:19:18,917 --> 01:19:23,047
In the olden days,
the Voivod woke up and said:

862
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:27,175
"Today I feel like hunting crows!"

863
01:19:27,583 --> 01:19:32,293
And they got some slaves up a tree
and the Voivod shot arrows at them

864
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:34,878
'til he killed one.

865
01:19:36,167 --> 01:19:38,215
'Til he hunted down a crow...

866
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:41,924
Could be. Woe is us...

867
01:20:02,333 --> 01:20:04,131
Easy, little master.

868
01:20:06,375 --> 01:20:09,458
So they see you've come on foot...

869
01:20:09,917 --> 01:20:11,840
It hurts, I can't walk.

870
01:20:13,833 --> 01:20:18,384
Better lame and on foot
than blind and in the saddle.

871
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:29,461
Easy, master, it hurts.

872
01:21:05,958 --> 01:21:10,168
- Constable, I have a word with you.
- Speak!

873
01:21:10,875 --> 01:21:13,298
- My horse was stolen.
- Where'd you keep it?

874
01:21:13,542 --> 01:21:16,421
- Behind the house...
- And what am I to do?

875
01:21:16,667 --> 01:21:21,252
Help me get the thief.
I'll thank you with something.

876
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:24,174
First see if it didn't stray.

877
01:21:24,375 --> 01:21:26,594
Look for it everywhere.

878
01:21:26,875 --> 01:21:28,092
As the saying goes:

879
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:31,507
I was looking for my mare
and I found I was astride it...

880
01:21:51,833 --> 01:21:54,837
- Crow, is the boyar home?
- He ain't, master.

881
01:21:55,167 --> 01:21:58,296
- Where's Vasile?
- I'll go get him.

882
01:22:08,417 --> 01:22:10,840
- Where'd you find the crow?
- None of your business.

883
01:22:11,208 --> 01:22:12,835
Have you paid your impost?

884
01:22:13,208 --> 01:22:14,676
I'll come and check.

885
01:22:14,875 --> 01:22:17,845
We don't have nothin'!

886
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:21,959
What will we send to Istanbul
and all the others we owe?

887
01:22:22,208 --> 01:22:25,542
Want the Ivans or the Turks
to come kill us?

888
01:22:26,458 --> 01:22:28,460
But the boyar pardoned us last year...

889
01:22:28,833 --> 01:22:32,508
That was last year...
Easter don't come every day.

890
01:22:32,792 --> 01:22:34,635
Rabble...

891
01:22:36,208 --> 01:22:38,381
Fuck your whore mother, Carfin!

892
01:22:40,292 --> 01:22:41,839
Get away,
or I'll bash your head in.

893
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:44,256
Stupid lowlife!

894
01:22:45,667 --> 01:22:49,752
'Twas because of him the boyar
gave us such torment here!

895
01:22:50,375 --> 01:22:53,800
He'll cane him
'til the flesh comes off his back.

896
01:22:54,125 --> 01:22:57,049
Mind the servants,
they're like the pest.

897
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:59,002
Scat now, or I'll whip-fuck you!

898
01:23:00,667 --> 01:23:02,294
Stupid people...

899
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:06,174
We'll go have a word with Lady Sultana.

900
01:23:06,708 --> 01:23:08,255
She's in the tower.

901
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:10,836
- Guard Carfin!
- Sure I will.

902
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,173
Tell her I'm here!

903
01:23:13,375 --> 01:23:16,800
They got you, Carfin!

904
01:23:19,292 --> 01:23:22,136
- Take the night pot, it's full.
- Faster, crow.

905
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:26,711
Why didn't you throw it
through the cracks?

906
01:23:33,792 --> 01:23:37,171
Bless you, merciful lady.

907
01:23:37,792 --> 01:23:43,424
May God give you happiness
for your infinite good deeds.

908
01:23:43,833 --> 01:23:46,712
I kiss your hand like a son.

909
01:23:46,917 --> 01:23:49,466
This is Ionita,
my boy and my helper.

910
01:23:49,667 --> 01:23:51,419
Thank you for letting us in.

911
01:23:51,625 --> 01:23:54,344
I didn't, you barged in.
What do you want?

912
01:23:54,542 --> 01:23:59,002
To tell you how my heart burns
when I see you suffering.

913
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:02,174
We've come to hand Carfin
over to the boyar...

914
01:24:02,375 --> 01:24:04,878
- How did you find him?
- Me?

915
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:07,962
- An old man knows what's in his bag...
- What bag?

916
01:24:08,292 --> 01:24:10,169
Don't you know the tale?

917
01:24:10,417 --> 01:24:12,545
An old man was beating
his wife with a bag

918
01:24:12,833 --> 01:24:16,963
and people wondered,
not knowing the bag was filled with rocks.

919
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:21,959
- Where was he?
- Working for a craftsman.

920
01:24:22,375 --> 01:24:26,005
Listen, he says the fault was yours

921
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:28,594
and the boyar shouldn't torment him...

922
01:24:28,917 --> 01:24:33,502
I just want to complain
to our Father Metropolitan,

923
01:24:33,958 --> 01:24:35,756
but my husband keeps me locked up.

924
01:24:35,917 --> 01:24:38,261
What for, kind lady?

925
01:24:38,458 --> 01:24:44,136
The beastly beatings I've suffered
from this enemy of mine.

926
01:24:46,042 --> 01:24:50,499
Heart of mine, don't cry so.
She cries all the time.

927
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:51,968
I See.

928
01:24:53,458 --> 01:24:55,460
I thought he'd kill me.

929
01:24:56,333 --> 01:24:59,758
I'll make a complaint,
curse his soul.

930
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,174
What can we do, sweet lady?
That's the way of the world,

931
01:25:03,417 --> 01:25:07,467
the man has the right
to punish his wife.

932
01:25:08,125 --> 01:25:10,093
That's our law.

933
01:25:10,667 --> 01:25:12,715
Yes, since Noah's days.

934
01:25:12,958 --> 01:25:18,294
Adam himself kicked Eve
in the stomach...

935
01:25:18,625 --> 01:25:20,719
Oh, keep your mouth shut!

936
01:25:20,958 --> 01:25:24,508
In the new law,
and even in Ipsilanti's codes.

937
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:28,004
Man is asked to beat his wife,
but with kindness.

938
01:25:28,208 --> 01:25:31,291
What kindness?
He broke my back.

939
01:25:31,708 --> 01:25:35,713
And I'm no lowborn or slave...

940
01:25:35,917 --> 01:25:38,466
As Basarab's book of law says:

941
01:25:38,667 --> 01:25:42,467
"Women shall be less castigated than men,

942
01:25:42,667 --> 01:25:47,628
as they are dimmer of wit
and weaker before sin..."

943
01:25:47,833 --> 01:25:50,302
I'm a dean's daughter, not a...

944
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:54,676
- Did he beat you with a cane, or a sword?
- With his fists.

945
01:25:54,875 --> 01:25:57,628
Then there's nothing to do.

946
01:25:58,250 --> 01:26:01,174
Had he used a cane,
I'd have taken your complaint myself.

947
01:26:01,375 --> 01:26:03,218
But you have no grounds.

948
01:26:03,542 --> 01:26:06,261
I'm here for the night pot.

949
01:26:09,167 --> 01:26:12,967
Even the Metropolitan
would say he was right.

950
01:26:13,417 --> 01:26:16,136
Being guilty of adultery...

951
01:26:16,292 --> 01:26:18,761
I'm not guilty of anything.

952
01:26:19,583 --> 01:26:21,335
Tell me what happened.

953
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:25,585
Carfin says it was you
who lured him...

954
01:26:25,875 --> 01:26:27,297
I will not speak of that.

955
01:26:27,458 --> 01:26:30,132
Merciful lady, he has a soul, too.

956
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:33,424
If the boyar beats him,

957
01:26:33,833 --> 01:26:36,916
or kills him for nothing...

958
01:26:38,667 --> 01:26:41,045
'Tis a great sin on your head...

959
01:26:42,208 --> 01:26:43,334
Fine.

960
01:26:44,125 --> 01:26:47,095
Tell the boyar it's my fault as well,
so he'll leave him be.

961
01:26:47,292 --> 01:26:49,420
Many thanks.

962
01:26:49,708 --> 01:26:52,962
We'll just interrogate him
and give him his fair share.

963
01:26:53,167 --> 01:26:55,465
By our Christian law.

964
01:26:58,708 --> 01:27:01,427
Don't be distressed,
I'll tell the boyar

965
01:27:01,625 --> 01:27:04,344
to be more gentle with you.

966
01:27:04,542 --> 01:27:07,421
Thank you.
But he's a bad man.

967
01:27:07,625 --> 01:27:10,094
He said he'd lock me up
in the monastery.

968
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:13,550
He only seems mean,
but he's got a heart of gold.

969
01:27:13,708 --> 01:27:18,589
We'll talk to him.
We'll leave you with God.

970
01:27:21,208 --> 01:27:23,506
Stay with God, lady!

971
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:37,966
Close that!

972
01:27:54,208 --> 01:27:56,711
Long live our bright lord!

973
01:28:01,708 --> 01:28:04,211
I have seven children, bright lord.

974
01:28:12,542 --> 01:28:14,089
Look at him.

975
01:28:15,167 --> 01:28:17,920
- Aferim, Costandin!
- Please, a word with you.

976
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:22,218
Take the hawk.

977
01:28:24,625 --> 01:28:28,004
I was sure you wouldn't find him.
I wanted to send a posse.

978
01:28:28,208 --> 01:28:30,711
We swore we'd find him!

979
01:28:30,875 --> 01:28:34,675
To serve your lordship,
we'd go through fire.

980
01:28:35,958 --> 01:28:39,758
Aferim, Costandin, may you live
as long as the Coltea Tower.

981
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:44,130
He who serves his master with zilos
is loved by God.

982
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:46,377
True, bright lord!

983
01:28:46,917 --> 01:28:49,796
- Where had he run off to?
- Working as a craftsman's slave.

984
01:28:50,042 --> 01:28:52,545
- In our county?
- No. Ionita found him.

985
01:28:52,708 --> 01:28:56,758
- He shot him, too.
- Aferim, Ionita!

986
01:28:59,542 --> 01:29:01,886
Good day, bright lord!

987
01:29:09,042 --> 01:29:14,253
Watch this hawk well,
it's a gift for Medvedkin.

988
01:29:14,792 --> 01:29:16,385
Yes, bright lord.

989
01:29:21,583 --> 01:29:25,213
- They caught Carfin, bright lord!
- 'Course!

990
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:30,711
Gather the crows,
the servants and the lady.

991
01:29:32,625 --> 01:29:35,469
Herd all the crows here!

992
01:29:38,833 --> 01:29:41,427
Bless you, bright lord!

993
01:30:08,917 --> 01:30:11,545
And the chibouk.

994
01:30:18,083 --> 01:30:21,633
Bright lord, how should I put this...

995
01:30:24,375 --> 01:30:25,376
Right...

996
01:30:48,625 --> 01:30:49,922
As agreed. Here.

997
01:30:51,667 --> 01:30:53,340
Thank you!

998
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,879
We need a writ of receipt
for our ruler.

999
01:31:09,125 --> 01:31:10,752
Of course.

1000
01:31:18,792 --> 01:31:20,135
Where's that feather?

1001
01:31:20,458 --> 01:31:22,631
- Isn't it there?
- It isn't.

1002
01:31:31,125 --> 01:31:34,174
- Here it was.
- You again.

1003
01:31:51,792 --> 01:31:54,045
Bright lord,
there's something else.

1004
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:55,714
Say it.

1005
01:31:57,042 --> 01:32:01,548
I know that this filthy maggot
blotted your honour...

1006
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:05,754
But we've learned
he's not the only one guilty.

1007
01:32:06,125 --> 01:32:09,208
He is, but
Lady Sultana is more at fault.

1008
01:32:09,417 --> 01:32:13,422
She confessed it herself.

1009
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:18,043
None of your business.
Cobbler, stick to your last!

1010
01:32:18,292 --> 01:32:19,589
Of course.

1011
01:32:19,875 --> 01:32:24,711
But 'tis my duty,
if I smell trickery...

1012
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:33,089
Noble lord, whip him,
just don't kill him.

1013
01:32:34,833 --> 01:32:36,961
Are you seeking trouble?

1014
01:32:37,917 --> 01:32:40,340
Tired of being a lawkeeper here?

1015
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:43,470
- No, bright lord.
- Well, then...

1016
01:32:48,042 --> 01:32:50,010
I was just thinking...

1017
01:32:50,917 --> 01:32:52,840
Wax!

1018
01:33:06,958 --> 01:33:10,292
- Take this!
- God bless you.

1019
01:33:15,292 --> 01:33:17,386
Your ishlik, master!

1020
01:33:22,792 --> 01:33:25,762
Sara, come with us!

1021
01:33:26,583 --> 01:33:29,837
He's a smart, hardworking slave...

1022
01:33:30,042 --> 01:33:31,760
- Who?
- Carfin.

1023
01:33:32,333 --> 01:33:34,335
Bring that dagger!

1024
01:33:34,833 --> 01:33:38,133
How about we write
Mahmud over in Istanbul?

1025
01:33:38,792 --> 01:33:40,260
- Who?
- We.

1026
01:33:40,583 --> 01:33:43,757
To ask him to award Carfin
the Nishan Itikhar order,

1027
01:33:44,042 --> 01:33:45,965
since he's such a good Gypsy.

1028
01:33:46,458 --> 01:33:49,302
Or the Russians,
to give him the Saint Vladimir?

1029
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:54,417
Psihi-mu, a word with you,
if I may.

1030
01:33:55,833 --> 01:33:59,292
What words
could you have with me?

1031
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:02,833
I have thoughts that
put me in great turmoil...

1032
01:34:04,125 --> 01:34:07,504
Iordache, please!

1033
01:34:09,542 --> 01:34:13,968
Shedding many a bitter tear
For her fun of yesteryear.

1034
01:34:17,917 --> 01:34:19,089
Where's that Vasile?

1035
01:34:19,333 --> 01:34:22,758
- He went to fetch Lady Sultana.
- Tell him to hurry!

1036
01:34:23,458 --> 01:34:28,043
Forgive him, master! Take pity!

1037
01:34:29,458 --> 01:34:33,634
What, they forgot the water
when they christened you?

1038
01:34:34,042 --> 01:34:36,215
He'll be fine.

1039
01:34:37,042 --> 01:34:39,295
Enough whining!

1040
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:43,880
May your lady and your bright
children live long and happy!

1041
01:34:47,583 --> 01:34:51,838
Are you pleased, agapi-mu,
for making me the town's laughingstock?

1042
01:34:52,083 --> 01:34:55,508
Me, your honourable spouse?

1043
01:34:55,792 --> 01:34:58,090
And with a Gypsy, too?!

1044
01:34:58,833 --> 01:35:02,292
Everyone laughs at me
like I'm an idiot,

1045
01:35:02,667 --> 01:35:06,342
Even the chickens laugh at me.
Even toddlers.

1046
01:35:06,542 --> 01:35:08,215
Get him out of the stocks!

1047
01:35:14,583 --> 01:35:17,086
Vasile! Grab his hands!

1048
01:35:19,042 --> 01:35:21,795
Carfin's, you idiot!

1049
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:23,750
Get him!

1050
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:34,298
Oh, Carfin!

1051
01:35:37,208 --> 01:35:40,291
Such a snake I raised by my manor...

1052
01:35:41,542 --> 01:35:43,920
Such a venomous viper...

1053
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,254
Let him be, it wasn't his fault!

1054
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:53,379
You soiled my life, you crow!

1055
01:35:53,625 --> 01:35:55,878
Forgive me, master, 'tain't my fault!

1056
01:35:56,083 --> 01:35:59,337
I treated you well,
like all my slaves.

1057
01:35:59,708 --> 01:36:02,302
I gave you food,
I gave you clothing,

1058
01:36:02,583 --> 01:36:05,666
I didn't beat you...
And you...

1059
01:36:05,667 --> 01:36:07,465
Venomous asp!

1060
01:36:07,667 --> 01:36:10,170
It was her fault, not mine!

1061
01:36:14,875 --> 01:36:16,752
Don't kill him!

1062
01:36:17,458 --> 01:36:20,177
Help, kind people, he'll kill me!

1063
01:36:21,958 --> 01:36:24,086
Constable, help me!

1064
01:36:24,750 --> 01:36:28,004
Noble lord, better let him get
his punishment from the ruler,

1065
01:36:28,167 --> 01:36:29,589
by the law...

1066
01:36:29,958 --> 01:36:33,792
You shut up!
Out of my sight, worm!

1067
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:40,175
Vasile! Raise his legs!

1068
01:36:44,792 --> 01:36:48,376
Give me the dagger!
Raise his cock, too!

1069
01:36:48,708 --> 01:36:51,632
Hold him!

1070
01:36:55,458 --> 01:36:58,837
Bright lord, try with this.

1071
01:37:00,667 --> 01:37:03,090
Hold him!

1072
01:37:11,875 --> 01:37:14,549
That'll teach him!

1073
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:17,344
Let it be a lesson to you all.

1074
01:37:18,792 --> 01:37:22,296
If you think
of doing such things here.

1075
01:37:23,167 --> 01:37:25,261
I'll find out.

1076
01:37:30,708 --> 01:37:33,086
Cut his cock too, master!

1077
01:37:51,833 --> 01:37:55,883
Here, kera-mu, eat his bollocks

1078
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:59,504
since you were so fond of loving...

1079
01:38:02,375 --> 01:38:04,594
Walk him around town,

1080
01:38:04,792 --> 01:38:07,170
for all to see
he's lost his bollocks,

1081
01:38:07,417 --> 01:38:11,047
then bring him back,
I have more to discuss with him.

1082
01:38:11,625 --> 01:38:16,882
Then take his wife to the fair
and trade her for another,

1083
01:38:17,083 --> 01:38:21,714
I will not see her here again.

1084
01:38:22,417 --> 01:38:23,714
Understood, bright lord.

1085
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,710
Only the law doesn't allow
to break apart a clan of slaves...

1086
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:33,801
That's your job!
Bribe someone if you must.

1087
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:36,047
Let's go back home, son.

1088
01:39:36,542 --> 01:39:40,092
Come on. Fuck it,
don't be a rag.

1089
01:39:41,833 --> 01:39:43,460
Be a man,
not flesh with eyes!

1090
01:39:43,667 --> 01:39:45,590
I'm fine, father.

1091
01:39:46,708 --> 01:39:49,427
He ain't your fuckin' brother.

1092
01:39:54,125 --> 01:39:58,380
God even looks after worms
and we can't look after each other...

1093
01:39:59,333 --> 01:40:01,631
This world will stay as it is,

1094
01:40:03,125 --> 01:40:05,844
you can't change it,
try as you might.

1095
01:40:06,958 --> 01:40:09,552
We live as we can,
not as we want.

1096
01:40:12,375 --> 01:40:15,675
But you'll be fine, my boy.
I'll get you into the army,

1097
01:40:15,917 --> 01:40:17,794
