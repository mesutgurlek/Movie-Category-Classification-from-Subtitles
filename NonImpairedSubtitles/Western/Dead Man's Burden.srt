they damn ran off our deer.

Well, we'll be.

You do that?

18
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,037
You run off our deer?

19
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:09,917
Only deer that's been
through here passed that way,

about an hour ago, I reckon?

might lower his sidearm?

You should have seen
them at CHeckamauga.

What you all boys doing now?

47
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,372
We're heading west.

48
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,790
I heard there's a strike--

49
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,708
Shut your trap.

50
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:37,129
I ain't got no interest
in mining.

51
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,673
That's like saying
you ain't got no interest

52
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,092
in making it rich.

53
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,218
Can't rightly say I do.

54
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:47,306
The fact is, I'm trying
my hand at farming.

55
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:48,515
Farming?

56
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,350
You don't look like
no farmer I ever saw.

57
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,476
That's on account
of being Deputy

58
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,228
of Cheyenne the last two years.

59
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,397
Well, Deputy, you ain't
said who you served under.

60
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,399
I thought.

61
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,193

00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,167
Under Taylor then?

66
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,960
Not under Taylor.

67
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,171
Not under Smith.

68
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:23,467
Hector or Hood neither.

69
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,724
I served in the
command of General Thomas.

know no General Thomas.

Promise me, next time,

80
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,433
a self-respecting Southerner
asked you who you served under.

81
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,561
I ain't no traitor.

82
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:18,188
Next time you ought to lie.

83
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,692
I ain't no liar neither.

84
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:23,193
Yeah, just 'cause
you made peace

with your past don't
mean the world has.

No. It seems like
a fair fight to me.

I'll just have stovetop Charlie
bring his China man over.

Yep. You're going
to be pig food.

Yes, you are you
[inaudible] dirt.

Wade, seeing as how you
ain't been around lately.

By the by, the way [inaudible]
has been talking sounds

as though she's aiming to make
a respectful man out of you.

00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:17,581
Thank you kindly if you'd
dispose of that for me.

Joe McCurry your Pa?

98
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,254
I reckon that depends on
which one of us you're asking.

99
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:26,465
Don't you think you
ought to read the thing?

Can't ride them all day.

Just give me a
gosh darn minute.

109
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:20,727
Shit. I'm starting to have
second thoughts whether you're

110
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,397
going to be all right
without me.

111
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:28,402
Hell Wade, you were my
Deputy, it ain't like we're kin.

112
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,904
I ain't your responsibility.

113
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,533
I told you to quit
about the damn letter.

114

My boy is hiding down
in Mexico on account

115

of a killing over a girl.

116
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,873
That's a hanging offense.

117
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:42,666
And yet a day don't
go by where me

118
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,626
and Janie [phonetic]
don't think on him.

119

blood, Wade, ain't nothing

truly break it.

Come on.

122
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:00,434
He really threatened
to shoot you?

123
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:04,980
I ain't home now, am I?

124
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,815
Well, ever occur to you

125
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,401
that he just might
have changed his mind?

ways higher than your ways."

This ain't no saloon.

00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:37,906
Fine sermon Reverend.

135
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:41,618
Sure is. Ain't for
his ears though.

136
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,580
There ain't no kind words ever
escaped your father's lips

137
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,998
about that fella.

138

We are here to remember
the dead not dishonor them

139

Well, this here
greedy carpetbagging son

141
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:57,593
of a bitch is a doing your
family the damn dishonor.

142
00:11:57,593 --> 00:12:00,137
Now, you know, I would
never do Joe no disrespect,

143
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,305

come stand by Heck and me.

Pa would've wanted
it that way, I think.

147
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,739
You mean that?

148
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,576
He lost to you at cards
more times that he could count.

149
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,204
Still he kept on coming back.

150
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:28,957
But you think you and
Heck might maybe want to come

151
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:32,836
and visit the lonely old
man one of these days?

My apologies for the

As far as meetings
with Three Penny Hank go,

I'd say yours wasn't
all that bad.

Best not begrudge
a man in mourning.

Me and your father
were very close.

Well, ain't nobody else
could stand neither of them.

call it courting.

00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:35,269
Yeah.

495
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:44,361
(Noise)

496
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:52,286
Heard you're going hunting,

497
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:54,037
thought you could
use a repeater.

498
00:40:54,037 --> 00:40:56,874
You couldn't hit a
buck with that antique.

499
00:40:56,874 --> 00:41:00,544
Is that a damn
Yankee rifle, 16 shooter?

500
00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:02,462
Mighty sweet of you.

501
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:08,719
(Noise)

502
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:11,305
That Three Penny Hank
fellow, you reckon he's the one

503
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:12,347
who sent Joe's letter?

504
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:14,349
The hell kind of
cartridge is this?

505
00:41:14,391 --> 00:41:15,517
44 M fire.

506
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:20,480
I can't say I
thought of it much.

507
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,901
That his place I
saw miles west of here?

508
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:25,527
Three Penny Hank has
been living by himself

509
00:41:25,527 --> 00:41:28,739
on a dying farm for more
years than I can count,

510
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:34,786
makes the man a little crazy.

511
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:37,748
I've been thinking on
something, plow that land

512
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:41,502
out there, plant it right, this
farm could really be something.

513
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:44,796
You don't think
Joe tried that?

514
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:46,548
It's a fine piece
of land ya'll got here.

515
00:41:46,548 --> 00:41:48,842
We're selling the farm.

516
00:41:50,385 --> 00:41:52,262
Well, if it's help you need,
I can stay on and stretch,

517
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:55,390
bear some of the burden.

518
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:58,435
Well that is a shame
decision's had been made.

519
00:41:58,435 --> 00:42:03,065
(Noise)

520
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:05,400
Are you sure little sunshine?

(Noise)

522
00:42:12,324 --> 00:42:13,408
Decision is made.

(Noise)

526
00:42:57,661 --> 00:43:00,164
Three Penny Hank?

527
00:43:00,164 --> 00:43:03,375
I don't take kindly
to that name, mister.

528
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:09,631
(Noise)

529
00:43:09,631 --> 00:43:12,384
Give it here, I ain't
a young man no more.

00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:20,851
(Noise)

531
00:43:20,851 --> 00:43:24,354
Well, Sergeant Major
McCurry, I swan.

532
00:43:24,354 --> 00:43:27,024
I wasn't sure there
was going to be a body

533
00:43:27,024 --> 00:43:29,234
on the other end of this.

534
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:32,237
It's a pleasure to make your
acquaintance Sergeant Major,

535
00:43:32,237 --> 00:43:33,822
a real pleasure.

536
00:43:33,864 --> 00:43:35,449
It's Wade.

537
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:43,665
You ain't trying to
pull one on me now are you?

538
00:43:43,665 --> 00:43:45,834
Joe didn't say nothing?

539
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:47,461
Hell no, he did not.

540
00:43:47,461 --> 00:43:52,841
I can see it though.

541
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:59,139
You got your father's eyes.

542
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:03,268
Well come on in, it's not as
a whorehouse on nickel night.

543
00:44:03,268 --> 00:44:06,647
We can deal a few hands, see if
you got your father's luck too.

544
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:12,861
Joe, he wouldn't
have changed his mind.

545
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:14,613
One hand.

546
00:44:14,613 --> 00:44:17,699
I ain't had a visitor
since your Pa was killed.

547
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:25,123
Well, I reckon you better
take that up with this horse.

548
00:44:25,123 --> 00:44:27,334
Hold on just one minute.

549
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:33,841
(Noise)

550
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:35,551
I ain't no soaker,

551
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:39,555
but we respect the dead
before we speak on him.

552
00:44:39,596 --> 00:44:45,727
Here's to you, Joe, it
turns out I was right.

553
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:48,355
You were a lying son of a bitch.

554
00:44:48,355 --> 00:44:49,398
You will be missed.

555
00:44:49,398 --> 00:44:55,112
(Noise)

556
00:44:55,112 --> 00:44:57,573
Joe.

557
00:44:57,614 --> 00:45:01,285
(Noise)

558
00:45:01,285 --> 00:45:04,913
You mustn't think much of me.

559
00:45:04,955 --> 00:45:08,667
I can't say I made
much of an opinion.

560
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:13,297
No. But I know a
lot of folks who don't.

561
00:45:13,297 --> 00:45:18,552
Crazy old coot, couldn't
grow mushrooms on manure.

562
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:24,516
But I'm a hell of a good
farmer, just ain't much water,

563
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:26,602
not around these parts anyway.

564
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:30,147
The letter.

565
00:45:30,147 --> 00:45:32,608
Hold your horses, son,
we're talking water here.

566
00:45:32,608 --> 00:45:38,947
My family's stead, it's
the only place that has it.

567
00:45:38,947 --> 00:45:43,577
I can see you are
the observant kind.

568
00:45:43,577 --> 00:45:44,786
What ain't so obvious is

569
00:45:44,786 --> 00:45:47,956
that there's copper
plenty around here.

570
00:45:47,998 --> 00:45:49,875
And if the mining company--

571
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:52,794
-- if the mining
companies ain't got no water

572
00:45:52,836 --> 00:45:54,755
to work their claims, well then

573
00:45:54,755 --> 00:45:56,965
that ore ain't ever
seeing the light of day.

574
00:45:57,007 --> 00:45:59,885
They need Joe's land
and they sent some good

575
00:45:59,885 --> 00:46:04,890
for nothing carpetbagger name of
Lane to make sure they get it.

576
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,143
under fire doesn't mean
he can't be snake bit.

577
00:46:08,185 --> 00:46:11,563
If and it was an accident,
how come the coffin was closed.

578
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:15,150
That's an awful big
charge you're making.

579
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:17,152
Well, he weren't
scalped by no Apache,

580
00:46:17,152 --> 00:46:18,737
he was throwed by a horse.

581
00:46:18,737 --> 00:46:22,950
Ain't no reason not to let us
say our last respects, unless--

582
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,535
unless he weren't
throwed by no horse.

583
00:46:24,535 --> 00:46:32,125
And the law, they had
nothing to say about this?

584
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:34,920
There ain't no
law around here.

585
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,215
You know Joe never said more
than two words about you

586
00:46:38,215 --> 00:46:40,634
but I wager I could
guess why he told folks

587
00:46:40,634 --> 00:46:43,846
that you was dead
Sergeant Major.

588
00:46:43,846 --> 00:46:47,182
Hell, he must have in it bad
if he felt you were the one

589
00:46:47,224 --> 00:46:51,478
that he had to call out
to 'cause like you said,

590
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:54,314
Joe ain't one to
change his mind.

591
00:46:54,314 --> 00:47:03,240
(Noise)

592
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:21,967
Were you present
when Joe died?

593
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:27,306
So you've been by
Three Penny Hank's place?

594
00:47:27,306 --> 00:47:30,851
He don't take too
kindly that name.

595
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:33,187
Nobody take too
kindly of him either.

596
00:47:36,273 --> 00:47:38,609
He mentioned a fellow
by the name of Lane.

597
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:41,653
He came to Joe's funeral.

598
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:43,697
Mr. Lane is the buyer.

599
00:47:44,698 --> 00:47:46,200
He kill Joe?

600
00:47:47,618 --> 00:47:48,869
Nobody killed him.

601
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:52,414
He was thrown by a horse.

602
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:56,376
Ain't that what killed me.?

603
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:00,756
So you're saying I'm a liar.

604
00:48:02,257 --> 00:48:07,679
This Lane, did
he threaten you?

605
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:10,807
I don't want this land, Wade.

606
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:13,185
The only reason we stayed

607
00:48:13,185 --> 00:48:16,647
so long is Pa wouldn't have
survived out here on his own.

608
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:19,858
Hank seems to
be doing just fine.

609
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:21,485
This place?

610
00:48:21,485 --> 00:48:23,654
It would kill me.

611
00:48:23,654 --> 00:48:27,157
Sure as it did our Ma.

612
00:48:27,157 --> 00:48:36,291
(Pause)

613
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:42,548
Joe threatened if I ever
came home, he'd kill me.

614
00:48:42,548 --> 00:48:47,970
And there he goes, writing
me a letter, asking me back.

615
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:50,931
That sound like the
pride-stricken man

616
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:52,766
that raised us up?

617
00:48:54,685 --> 00:48:56,103
Nobody killed him.

618
00:48:56,103 --> 00:49:00,732
(Pause)

619
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:03,694
I reckon I don't know
how you can be so sure.

620
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:06,905
Asking you as
your only family,

621
00:49:06,905 --> 00:49:09,074
will you please leave it alone?

622
00:49:09,074 --> 00:49:14,913
(Pause)

623
00:49:14,913 --> 00:49:17,916
Ain't no reason to be
scared, little sunshine.

624
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:21,086
I will strike down anyone who
tries to harm this here family.

625
00:49:21,086 --> 00:49:25,883

Hank brought on any hands.

629

631

I do not believe we had
the pleasure of acquaintance.

632
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:03,879
You're E.J. Lane.

633
00:50:03,879 --> 00:50:08,050
Banker and killer.

634
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:10,636
I'm going to bring you before
a judge for what you've done.

635
00:50:10,636 --> 00:50:13,180
Wait, you let him go.

636
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:16,058
There ain't a judge for a
three-day ride from here.

637
00:50:16,058 --> 00:50:17,643
It's quite the impertinent
way to treat a guest.

638
00:50:17,643 --> 00:50:19,394
I do apologize,
Mr. Lane, we had an--

639
00:50:19,436 --> 00:50:22,481
[Inaudible] I'd appreciate
it if you get my horse.

640
00:50:22,481 --> 00:50:27,236

ordered about.

642

Wade, is it?

643
00:50:45,963 --> 00:50:51,635
I'd be glad to know what
I'm being accused of.

644
00:50:51,635 --> 00:50:55,097
Didn't figure you
were one for games.

645
00:50:55,138 --> 00:50:56,431
Wade.

646
00:50:56,473 --> 00:51:01,144
Well, you know that a
crime, whatever it may be,

647
00:51:01,144 --> 00:51:06,108
requires evidence, so
please present yours.

648
00:51:06,108 --> 00:51:15,284
(Music)

649
00:51:27,963 --> 00:51:32,092
Moving, yet meaningless.

650
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:38,140
I'm sorry for your loss.

651
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,309
I've been known for
trying to put reason

00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:46,356
I have a sale to attend to.

654
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:51,695
So you can either shoot me
in the back like a coward

655
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:53,197
or let me be on my way.

See, he's made an
offer for this glass.

663
00:52:39,076 --> 00:52:48,043
But this glass is
full of whiskey.

664
00:52:48,043 --> 00:52:50,671
What you're trying to
do is buy this glass

665
00:52:50,671 --> 00:52:54,049
and get the whiskey for free.

666
00:52:54,049 --> 00:52:55,050
Why don't you
take that whiskey,

667
00:52:55,092 --> 00:52:59,555
pour it right back
in that bottle.

668
00:52:59,596 --> 00:53:01,723
I'm making a fair
counter here.

669
00:53:01,723 --> 00:53:05,394
It is a thousand dollars,
750 for all my acres,

670
00:53:05,394 --> 00:53:09,857
250 for everything on it.

671
00:53:09,857 --> 00:53:11,024
It's your property.

672
00:53:11,024 --> 00:53:15,404
I imagined you've more
to say on its fate.

673
00:53:15,404 --> 00:53:18,282
Hell of an imagination.

You just hold
on a minute here.

690
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:32,981
I'm going to see you hung.

691
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:37,653
Innocent men have
nothing to fear from the law.

692
00:54:39,154 --> 00:54:40,113
Where's the nearest judge?

693
00:54:40,113 --> 00:54:46,286
No reason to fear,
little sunshine.

694
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:50,123
He ain't going to hurt you.

695
00:54:50,123 --> 00:54:56,004
Judge Hawkins in Alameda,
a three-day ride from here.

696
00:54:56,004 --> 00:54:58,173
Get up.

697
00:54:58,173 --> 00:54:59,508
No boy.

703
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:22,948
I can get the drop on him.

704
00:55:22,948 --> 00:55:24,783
No, no.
I will talk to him.

705
00:55:24,783 --> 00:55:26,451
The only thing he's going
to listen to is a bullet.

706
00:55:26,451 --> 00:55:29,955
And what has he done to
make you think a crazy notion
like that?

707
00:55:29,955 --> 00:55:32,124
Goddamn it Martha!

708
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:34,209

there Wade McCurry.

How's that one?

713
00:55:50,267 --> 00:55:54,188
The faster we get done with
this nonsense, the better.

I have been trying

00:56:08,702 --> 00:56:12,539
for going on four years now.

718
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:19,338
First Ma got sick then Pa
needed me to stay and now you.

719
00:56:22,758 --> 00:56:24,343
You're asking
that I let him go.

720
00:56:24,343 --> 00:56:31,183
I'm asking you to let me
be rid of this place for good.

want to go out into,

00:56:40,442 --> 00:56:43,779
it wouldn't be a
place fit living.

724
00:56:43,779 --> 00:56:45,447
Not without the law.

725
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:49,243
It would be better than here.

this way, if you'll have me.

731
00:57:22,609 --> 00:57:28,907
You do this, you're betraying
the only kin you got left.

732
00:57:28,907 --> 00:57:32,202
You sound like Pa.

733
00:57:32,202 --> 00:57:37,708
I'm nothing like him.

734
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:39,001
Why'd he tell us you were dead?

735
00:57:39,001 --> 00:57:42,045
Don't think about past.

736
00:57:42,045 --> 00:57:46,466
No. No, it isn't.

me from leaving just

like you're doing now.

aren't words you forget.

If you ride out of
here, you ain't my son.

You're a goddamn traitor.

If our boys don't
kill you, I will.

I reckon you know.

00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:23,086
No. I need to hear
you say the word.

747
00:58:26,131 --> 00:58:30,177
I was going to join the Union
Army to fight for my country.

I'll fall off.

right back up again.

Yeah, well Apache
wouldn't want no cups.

991
01:21:46,114 --> 01:21:48,450
Sure would like these
fritters, though.

992
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:51,995
You plan on living
like a savage.

993
01:21:51,995 --> 01:21:54,581
But we best leave like one
'cause we don't want no posse

Did you kill Pa?

After all what you did to us.

1019
01:25:14,865 --> 01:25:23,290
You left. My whole
family died because of it.

1020
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:25,959
You killed my husband.

1021

You killed your little brother.

1022
01:25:28,337 --> 01:25:34,343
There was no one here
to look out for us

because he was on
the other side!

You trapped me here

one foot in front of the other.

Is that too much to
ask of my only kin?

1043
01:27:41,595 --> 01:27:46,141
This thing, it's
for the law to decide.

What law?
