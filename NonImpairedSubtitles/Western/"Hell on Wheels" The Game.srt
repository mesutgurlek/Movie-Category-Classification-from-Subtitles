I'm--I can't stop thinking
about Toole

656
00:40:51,764 --> 00:40:52,864
and what he done.

657
00:40:52,898 --> 00:40:54,166
And sometimes, I get scared

658
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,367
that I'm gonna hurt the baby.

659
00:40:55,401 --> 00:40:56,901
No, you ain't gonna do that.

660
00:40:56,935 --> 00:40:58,236
- You ain't gonna hurt--
- But what if I do?

661
00:40:58,271 --> 00:40:59,437
You ain't gonna hurt our baby.

662
00:40:59,472 --> 00:41:00,905
You're not gonna hurt our baby.

663

That's not you, Eva.
That's not you.

664
00:41:05,244 --> 00:41:06,911
What I read in there,
that's you.

665
00:41:06,945 --> 00:41:09,947
That's who you are.
At least it was before this--

666
00:41:09,982 --> 00:41:13,951
Yeah, before the baby came.

667
00:41:13,986 --> 00:41:16,555
Not no more.

Mr. Bohannon,
I need to speak with you.

669
00:41:20,926 --> 00:41:21,959
A source has given me

670
00:41:21,994 --> 00:41:23,795
some information
about your past.

671
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:26,731
That source be Thomas Durant?

672

What does the 13th Ohio
Infantry mean to you?

673
00:41:33,272 --> 00:41:37,875
You want a railroad story?

674
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,811
I just made a deal
with the Kiowa

675
00:41:39,845 --> 00:41:41,125
to harvest spruce
off their land.

676
00:41:41,146 --> 00:41:42,380
Now this is gonna be
the first time

Is it true

680
00:41:50,356 --> 00:41:53,358
you killed five men
in cold blood?

681
00:41:59,332 --> 00:42:01,766
That's not a railroad story.

682
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,167
I got a town to move.

683
00:42:03,202 --> 00:42:05,069
It is a railroad story,
Mr. Bohannon.

684
00:42:05,104 --> 00:42:07,505
Is it true?

685
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,140
Did you do it?

Where is she?

Where's my baby?

Where'd she go?
Where's my baby?

She was right there.

We'll find her!
