a lighted lamp in the window.

in them ashes.

ducked out of the barn
before it went blooey.

count on him to leave
that gold lyin' around.

He wasn't cartin' no baggage
when he left.

them girls can
do it, too.

you get this?

alongside the barn
after we put that fire out.

00:15:44,859 --> 00:15:48,028
A man on the dodge,
in strange country,

156
00:15:48,096 --> 00:15:51,365
and he just happens
to stumble
into Wagon Mound.

157
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:54,918
(CHUCKLES)
That was a piece
of luck, wasn't it?

158
00:15:54,986 --> 00:15:56,737
It weren't all luck.

159
00:16:00,892 --> 00:16:03,160
Reckon you got
a right to know.

160
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,798
Somebody steered him here.
What do you mean?

161
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:12,152
Somebody passed the word
that he'd find a welcome
in Wagon Mound.

162
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:18,275
That ain't so strange.
It could have been
just about anybody.

163
00:16:18,342 --> 00:16:20,810
Could have been Matt.
MA: No.

164
00:16:20,878 --> 00:16:23,247
Why not?
Why not my man?

165
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:26,533
Or hers? Or hers?

166
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:30,738
Because, if it were
my boy, he'd have
sent word to his Ma.

167
00:16:30,806 --> 00:16:32,205
Or to us.

168
00:16:33,374 --> 00:16:35,075
One of us.

169
00:16:35,143 --> 00:16:36,744
Well, how do we know
he'd send word?

170
00:16:36,812 --> 00:16:40,314
We've sat in this hole
for two years, waitin'
for him to come back.

171
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:42,182
How do we know
he's comin' back at all?

172
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:47,003
Oh, he'll be back, Ruby.
He's a married man.

173
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:52,076
Also a very rich one,
now the gold doesn't have
to be divided four ways.

174
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:55,295
How do we know
there's any gold?

175
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:58,598
How do we know it ain't
just a trick to keep us here
till we're as old as she is?

176
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,834
MA: You know
because I say so!

177
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:10,327
Stay away from
that Kehoe man,
you hear?

178
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:17,050
I got a boy out there,
someplace.

179
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:19,954
I can't rightly
put a face
nor a name to him,

180
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:23,924
but I know he's there,
and I know
he's dependin' on his ma

181
00:17:23,992 --> 00:17:26,560
to ride his fences
for him.

182
00:17:26,627 --> 00:17:28,729
Now, one of you
belongs to him,

183
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:32,399
by the laws of God
and this Territory.

184
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:35,368
And when he comes back
to claim his property,

185
00:17:35,436 --> 00:17:38,605
well, he's goin'
to find everything
just like he left it.

186
00:17:38,673 --> 00:17:43,310
I mean everything.
Now, go on,
get up to bed!

187
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:03,731
Ruby? Do you think
I ought to set an extra
place for Mr. Kehoe?

188
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:06,366
How would I know?

189
00:18:06,434 --> 00:18:08,468
You been
thinkin' about him
all night, huh?

190
00:18:08,537 --> 00:18:12,039
I haven't even seen him,
except to help
carry him up to bed.

191
00:18:12,106 --> 00:18:13,607
Well, save
your dreams.

192
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,944
He'll not have
eyes for you,
not in that black sack.

BIRDIE:
 When I was a little girl

194
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,699
 I used to play with toys

195
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:23,851
 Now that I'm a bigger girl

196
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,486
 I'd rather play with... 

197
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:29,523
Where is he?
Under the table.

198
00:18:29,591 --> 00:18:31,291
He's still here,
ain't he?

199
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,060
Oh, he's here
all right.

200
00:18:33,127 --> 00:18:36,864
My, don't we all look
lovely this morning?

201
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:40,000
Well, it's just
common decency to look
after our appearance.

202
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:43,737
Common it is.
I'd argue
about the decency.

That's French
perfume!

207

for me when he got
out of jail in Chicago.

208

You all kill me.

209

A man sleeps
under our roof for
the first time in two years,

210
00:19:01,422 --> 00:19:02,957
and you all remember
you're women.

211
00:19:03,024 --> 00:19:06,426
Runnin' around like
a bunch of scared chickens.

212
00:19:06,494 --> 00:19:10,764
That's what you sound like
this mornin', too.
A bunch of cacklin' hens.

213
00:19:14,002 --> 00:19:17,638
Lord, thanks for
the vittles. Amen.

214
00:19:17,706 --> 00:19:21,442
What about Mr. Kehoe?
Won't he be wantin'
some breakfast?

215
00:19:22,376 --> 00:19:24,178
He had his.

216
00:19:24,245 --> 00:19:26,213
ORALIE: Is he feelin'
any better, Ma?

217
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:28,248
I expect so.

218
00:19:28,316 --> 00:19:32,118
He's a big man,
that one. Strong.

219
00:19:32,186 --> 00:19:35,288
Well, eat your breakfast.
What's wrong with you?
You all got the pip?

220
00:19:35,356 --> 00:19:37,891
My sisters-in-law
are upset today.

221
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:41,495
A man's come into
their lives to remind them
of their widowhood.

222
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:45,198
We don't need
no reminders.
We got Ma.

223
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:47,468
You watch your tongue.

224
00:19:47,535 --> 00:19:50,971
And as soon as you've ate,
you get upstairs and get
into some decent clothes.

225
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:52,773
And wash that rouge
off your face.

226
00:19:52,841 --> 00:19:54,441
You look like
a dancehall girl.

227
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:57,878
(LAUGHING)
You take that thing
out of your hair.

228
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,848
What's the matter?
You all forgot
you're married women?

229
00:20:00,915 --> 00:20:02,516
On the contrary, Ma.

230
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:06,854
Mr. Kehoe's sudden arrival
has freshened the memory
of their loss.

231
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:09,255
In a pig's eye, it has.

232
00:20:09,323 --> 00:20:11,057
I ain't nobody's fool.

233
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,193
I aim to see
he leaves here today.

234
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:17,464
It don't seem right,
puttin' a bullet in a man and
throwin' him out like that.

235
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:20,567
Well, I'll decide
what's right.

236
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:22,402
Sabina, as soon as
you've had breakfast,
you get up there

237
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:26,640
and fix his bandages,
and tell him
to get his day's rest,

238
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,042
'cause he'll get
nothin' else here.

239
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,311
Go on, now,
eat your breakfast.

00:20:57,104 --> 00:21:00,440
According to Ma,
we're about to
lose you, Mr. Kehoe.

00:21:02,143 --> 00:21:04,645
I don't believe
I've had the pleasure.

00:21:04,712 --> 00:21:08,782
I'm Sabina McDade.
I dressed you last night.
Don't you remember?

246
00:21:10,484 --> 00:21:12,102
I wish I did.

247
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:15,188
I was referring
to your wound.
Sit down.

248
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,293
Much obliged
for the patchwork.

249
00:21:20,361 --> 00:21:23,463
Oh, we doctor
all our sick animals,
Mr. Kehoe.

250
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:29,369
Where will you go
from here?
Back to Dakota?

251
00:21:30,304 --> 00:21:31,705
Why Dakota?

252
00:21:31,773 --> 00:21:34,240
I thought you had
a friend there.

253
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:37,444
Not in Dakota
or any place else.

254
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:41,448
Judging from the scars
I counted on you,
you have plenty of enemies.

255
00:21:41,515 --> 00:21:44,751
You must have
at least one friend.

256
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:48,021
Well, I thought
the old lady
might be a friend,

257
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:51,692
but you tell me
she's turning me out
tail over tea kettle.

258
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:54,427
What about the man
who sent you here?

259
00:21:56,297 --> 00:21:57,931
What about him?

260
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:06,473
Was he any of these?

261
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:10,511
The boys?

262
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:16,183
They look
like they knew
what was coming.

263
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,818
Do you see your friend,
Mr. Kehoe?

264
00:22:21,722 --> 00:22:22,739
No.

265
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,493
Well, that's disappointing.

266
00:22:27,528 --> 00:22:29,629
I was hoping
you'd say yes.

267
00:22:29,697 --> 00:22:33,600
Then, instead of merely
suspecting it,
I'd know you were a faker.

00:22:33,668 --> 00:22:35,502
How so?

269
00:22:35,569 --> 00:22:39,506
If you'd pointed out
one of those men
as your friend...

270
00:22:39,573 --> 00:22:42,726
You see, Mr. Kehoe,
that's not a photograph
of the McDade boys.

271
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:44,628
They never
had one taken.

272
00:22:46,564 --> 00:22:49,265
I figured that.

273
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:53,570
Since we're identifying
McDades, which one
were you paired off with?

Still is,
for all you know.

Yes.

You don't sound overjoyed.

278
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,399
I'm not sentimental,
Mr. Kehoe.

279
00:23:05,466 --> 00:23:07,467
Least of all
about Boone.

We'd been married
exactly two hours

281
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:13,140
when he walked out of
our hotel room. "To get
some whiskey," he said.

282
00:23:13,207 --> 00:23:15,375
A week later, I picked up
the paper and read
where he and the others

283
00:23:15,443 --> 00:23:18,745
had robbed
a Touchstone bank.

284
00:23:18,812 --> 00:23:23,116
So, you high-tailed it
for Wagon Mound
to get your cut?

285
00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:25,836
I can't deceive you,
can I, Mr. Kehoe?

286
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:30,273
You wouldn't wait
two years for any man.

287

that would be
worth waiting for.

I never pretended otherwise,
not even to Ma.
It wasn't necessary.

289
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:43,103
She knew what was
due Boone's wife.

290
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,205
She even gave me
the wedding ring off
her own finger

291
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:49,409
to make up for the one
he promised me.

292
00:23:49,476 --> 00:23:54,314
Beside Ma, every man
I ever met looked like

304
00:24:53,174 --> 00:24:55,475
It's a
beautiful morning.

305
00:24:55,543 --> 00:24:59,096
Eyes like yours,
miss, must see beauty
wherever they look.

306
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:02,181
Have a hot biscuit, mister?

307
00:25:02,249 --> 00:25:04,784
Well, thank you kindly.
My name's Dan.

308
00:25:04,852 --> 00:25:07,887
My name's Birdie,
mister...

309
00:25:09,306 --> 00:25:11,775
You just let me
call you mister.

310
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,477
You don't know how good
that sounds to me.

311
00:25:14,545 --> 00:25:18,481
For a man who doesn't
have a woman of his own,
this is a real treat.

312
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:22,619
(GIGGLES)
Oh, cookin' biscuits
is nothin'.

313
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,088
I used to be
on the stage
in Chicago.

314
00:25:25,155 --> 00:25:26,623
I was a dance...

315
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,075
I mean,
I was a actress.

316
00:25:29,143 --> 00:25:32,228
Now, you didn't
have to tell me that,
Miss Birdie.

317
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:35,164
You've got a real flavor
in your voice.

318
00:25:35,216 --> 00:25:37,351
Have I really?

319
00:25:37,418 --> 00:25:39,452
You weren't
in the theater?

320
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,856
I've been privileged, ma'am.
All the world is a stage.

321
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,313
Pardon me.

322
00:25:53,183 --> 00:25:54,885
(ROOSTER CROWING)

323
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,111
Forgive me for staring, miss,
but, for a second there,

324
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:07,881
I thought that bullet
had sent me to an angel.

325
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:10,299
No angel, Mr. Kehoe.

326
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:13,336
I'm afraid here
we're all cursed for
the sin of violence.

327
00:26:13,403 --> 00:26:16,006
All my life,
I've fought violence.

328
00:26:16,073 --> 00:26:20,143
Fought it with fist and gun.
Whom do I have
the honor of addressing?

329
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,946
I'm Oralie,
widow to Roy McDade.

330
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:27,717
Oh, perhaps not,
Miss Oralie. Maybe Roy
is the one who was spared.

331
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:30,820
Unless the good Lord
has other plans for you.

332
00:26:34,742 --> 00:26:36,076
Pardon me.

333
00:26:41,415 --> 00:26:43,516
Ruby McDade.
From El Paso.

334
00:26:44,618 --> 00:26:46,987
Ah, the city of sin.

335
00:26:47,721 --> 00:26:50,390
I loved it.

336
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:52,943
You know, the old woman,
she don't miss
so many times.

337
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,511
You're a lucky man.

338
00:26:54,578 --> 00:26:57,614
Yes, I've had
many complaints
to that effect.

339
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:02,052
I don't complain.
I'd like some of
your luck.

340
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,288
I'd be delighted
to share it with you,
Miss Ruby.

341
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:10,694
 Wished I was in Tennessee

342
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:13,396
 Sittin' in a big armchair

343
00:27:13,464 --> 00:27:15,899
 One arm 'round
the whiskey... 

344
00:27:45,412 --> 00:27:46,813
Hello!

345
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:50,133
You look kind of
cold in there.

346
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,468
Come on out,
and I'll show you how
Prince used to warm up

347
00:27:52,536 --> 00:27:54,303
after taking a bath.

348
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:56,139
Thanks. But I don't think...

349
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,525
You know, first time
I saw you, I said,

350
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:01,795
"He makes me feel
like I used to
with my husband, Prince."

351
00:28:01,863 --> 00:28:03,463
It must be the mustache.

352
00:28:03,531 --> 00:28:04,764
Prince have a mustache?

353
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:06,899
No, that's what I mean.

354
00:28:06,967 --> 00:28:10,670
I always wondered what it
would be like to get kissed
by a man that did have.

355
00:28:10,738 --> 00:28:12,822
Uh, Miss Birdie,
you got me all wrong.

356
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:17,027
I'm not the kind of man
to take liberties
with a married woman.

357
00:28:17,094 --> 00:28:18,929
Didn't I mention
I'm a widow?

358
00:28:18,996 --> 00:28:20,563
How do you know?

359
00:28:20,631 --> 00:28:23,466
I just know.
Prince wouldn't have
run off like that.

360
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:25,902
He always did just what
the others was doing.

361
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,004
If they wanted to stay
and get blown up,

362
00:28:28,072 --> 00:28:30,256
he'd stay
and get blown up, too.

363
00:28:30,324 --> 00:28:34,344
Well, looking at you,
I would say that was
mighty short-sighted of him.

364
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:37,247
Yeah, I was awful
sad about Prince.

365
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,849
I miss him
something terrible.

366
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:44,420
A woman doesn't hold
a candle to a man for
company, do you think?

367
00:28:44,488 --> 00:28:47,139
That depends on
your point of view.

368
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:52,261
You must be freezin'
in there. Come on out,
I won't look.

369
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:56,232
Well, if you're not
comin' out,
I'm a comin' in.

370
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,317
 Wished I was in Tennessee 

371
00:28:58,469 --> 00:29:00,236
(GUN FIRES)

372
00:29:11,732 --> 00:29:13,866
SABINA:
Come up, Mr. Kehoe.

373
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:32,234
Expecting company?

374
00:29:32,302 --> 00:29:35,137
We don't encourage
callers, Mr. Kehoe.

375
00:29:35,205 --> 00:29:37,974
Well, maybe you ought
to change your ways.

376
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:40,276
A batch of beautiful
widow ladies and all.

377
00:29:40,344 --> 00:29:44,080
(CHUCKLES)
The callers we do get
don't come courting.

378
00:29:44,147 --> 00:29:46,483
They come hunting
something.

379
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,284
Maybe the same thing
you're hunting.

380
00:29:48,352 --> 00:29:51,721
I'm not hunting anything,
Miss Sabina, except
a little peace and quiet.

381
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:55,558
Don't touch that bell rope
if you want to stay
in one piece.

382
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:57,994
What is it?
A dynamite fuse?

383
00:29:58,061 --> 00:30:00,746
A relic
of the old days,
Mr. Kehoe.

384
00:30:00,814 --> 00:30:04,918
When the boys
used to come back
from their business trips,

385
00:30:04,985 --> 00:30:08,054
they flashed a signal
from up there
on the rim-rock.

386
00:30:08,122 --> 00:30:09,755
And when it was
safe for them
to come on in,

387
00:30:09,823 --> 00:30:12,858
Ma used to signal them
back by ringing the bell.

388
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:17,630
Oh! You figure there's
a McDade up there now,
waiting to hear it ring?

389
00:30:17,697 --> 00:30:19,565
I don't, Mr. Kehoe.

390
00:30:19,633 --> 00:30:22,868
But Ma still thinks
there'll be a signal
flashed any day.

391
00:30:22,937 --> 00:30:25,538
That's why she wants
one of us to be
on the watch.

392
00:30:25,605 --> 00:30:27,040
Well, that's kind of
a thankless job

393
00:30:27,107 --> 00:30:29,475
if you don't believe
he's coming back, isn't it?

394
00:30:29,543 --> 00:30:31,577
We take turns.

395
00:30:31,645 --> 00:30:34,613
Besides,
it's a quiet place
to do my accounts.

396
00:30:35,482 --> 00:30:36,582
Accounts?

397
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:39,485
Oh, yes.
We're in trade,
Mr. Kehoe.

398
00:30:39,553 --> 00:30:44,190
We raise chickens.
Ma trades the eggs
in Touchstone for supplies.

399
00:30:46,726 --> 00:30:50,229
Did you think we had
some invisible
means of support?

400
00:30:50,297 --> 00:30:54,900
Well, I can't say
I've given the subject
much study, Miss Sabina.

401
00:30:54,969 --> 00:30:57,670
How is the egg business
these days?

402
00:30:57,737 --> 00:31:02,442
Oh, at the moment
there isn't any.
The hens aren't laying.

403
00:31:02,509 --> 00:31:04,710
Maybe you need
a new rooster.

404
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:19,492
A penny for your thoughts,
Mr. Kehoe.

405
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,861
Oh, I wouldn't rob you.

406
00:31:21,928 --> 00:31:23,463
Wouldn't you?

407
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:27,633
I got one thought
you can have.

408
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:31,270
How much will it cost me?

409
00:31:31,338 --> 00:31:33,306
A 20 dollar
gold piece.

410
00:31:48,455 --> 00:31:50,990
Well?
What's your thought,
Mr. Kehoe?

411
00:31:53,193 --> 00:31:55,411
That you're
a worse liar
than I am.

412
00:31:55,479 --> 00:31:56,646
Sabina!

413
00:31:58,448 --> 00:31:59,548
Sabina!

414
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:00,950
Yes, Ma?

415
00:32:01,018 --> 00:32:02,785
You seen anything
of that Kehoe man?

416
00:32:02,853 --> 00:32:04,220
Have you lost him?

417
00:32:04,287 --> 00:32:06,055
That don't signify.

418
00:32:06,123 --> 00:32:08,625
Just wanna make sure
I ain't lost nothin' else.

419
00:32:09,693 --> 00:32:11,728
You want me, ma'am?

420
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,498
Well, I do and I don't.

421
00:32:18,902 --> 00:32:21,037
What's that?
You come into money?

422
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,772
Yeah, in a way.

423
00:32:23,674 --> 00:32:25,908
You trust me
with my gun?

424
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:33,382
Thank you.

425
00:33:01,628 --> 00:33:03,629
How come you done that?

426
00:33:15,742 --> 00:33:18,478
 Wished I was in Tennessee

427
00:33:18,545 --> 00:33:20,179
 Sittin' in a big... 

428
00:33:20,247 --> 00:33:21,481
Listen!

429
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:24,117
The lot of you.

430
00:33:25,652 --> 00:33:28,020
I know what you're all
day-dreamin' about.

431
00:33:28,088 --> 00:33:31,824
You can forget it
right now, 'cause
it ain't gonna happen.

432
00:33:37,731 --> 00:33:41,400
I don't know which
of my boys is alive,
and you don't know which.

433
00:33:41,468 --> 00:33:44,237
But one of you
belongs to him,

434
00:33:44,304 --> 00:33:46,021
and don't you forget that.

435
00:33:48,074 --> 00:33:51,810
Myself, I wouldn't
give a plug-nickel
for the lot of you.

436
00:33:51,878 --> 00:33:55,047
But I didn't do the pickin',
they done it for themselves,

437
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:57,783
and a fine lot
they picked, too.

438
00:33:57,851 --> 00:34:01,720
A fussin' and a figetin'
ever since that blame
Kehoe man come here.

439
00:34:01,788 --> 00:34:05,190
DAN: Were you
callin' me, ma'am?

440
00:34:05,258 --> 00:34:10,029
If I was to call you
what I'm thinkin', this here
air would be blue, mister.

441
00:34:10,096 --> 00:34:12,598
I got just
two words for you.

442
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:14,567
Pack. Go.

443
00:34:17,104 --> 00:34:19,772
I been packed,
ever since last night.

444
00:34:21,975 --> 00:34:26,145
The way things stand.
Well, I

445
00:34:26,212 --> 00:34:30,249
figure that, that fellow
in Dakota must've given me
the wrong address.

446
00:34:35,388 --> 00:34:37,156
But, Ma, he's hurt.

447
00:34:38,992 --> 00:34:40,693
His horse ain't.

448
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:42,461
Ma. Ma, look.

449
00:34:49,336 --> 00:34:52,622
Mr. Kehoe may be
leaving sooner
than he expected.

450
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:56,292
Go on. Get in the house.
Go on. Get a move on,
all of you.

451
00:34:58,261 --> 00:34:59,762
Go on! Get!

452
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,202
Stay out of sight, mister.

453
00:35:13,293 --> 00:35:15,811
MA: Get off my land,
Tom Larrabee.

454
00:35:16,646 --> 00:35:18,214
Now, Ma,

455
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,416
we know he's there!

456
00:35:20,484 --> 00:35:23,952
So send him out now,
so there won't be
no trouble!

457
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,754
Send who on out?

458
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,157
Are you sure, son?

459
00:35:28,225 --> 00:35:30,359
Sure, I'm sure.

460
00:35:30,427 --> 00:35:32,328
You know who, Ma!

461
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:34,346
That boy of yours!

462
00:35:34,414 --> 00:35:36,866
Ain't no boy
of mine here.

463
00:35:44,758 --> 00:35:47,176
Next time it won't
be your hat.

464
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,346
Where you goin',
mister?

465
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:51,881
Out there.

466
00:35:51,948 --> 00:35:53,349
You give up easy?

467
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,284
It's a McDade
they're after.

468
00:35:55,352 --> 00:35:57,186
LARRABEE: You can't
stop us this time, Ma.

469
00:35:57,254 --> 00:36:00,322
So why don't you
call it quits before
somebody gets hurt.

470
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:04,827
Don't be a fool, mister.
You're courtin' a rope's end,
and you know it.

471
00:36:04,895 --> 00:36:07,497
I got a chance.
You ladies haven't.

472
00:36:11,785 --> 00:36:13,252
Hold your fire!

473
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:26,899
That's him.

474
00:36:27,701 --> 00:36:29,568
That ain't no McDade.

475
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:40,062
Something I can do
for you boys?

476
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,131
What's your name?

477
00:36:42,198 --> 00:36:43,433
What's yours?

478
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,285
What're you doin'
in Wagon Mound?

479
00:36:46,353 --> 00:36:47,787
Resting.

480
00:36:47,855 --> 00:36:49,789
Anybody here besides you?

481
00:36:50,907 --> 00:36:53,092
Five lovely ladies.

482
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,912
Well, you just saddle up.
You're goin' back
into town with us.

483
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,980
What for?

484
00:36:57,047 --> 00:36:58,981
Because I say so.

485
00:36:59,049 --> 00:37:01,800
I don't know what business
you got in Wagon Mound,

486
00:37:01,868 --> 00:37:04,954
but I ain't takin'
no chances on it
interferin' with mine.

487
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:07,272
You want McDade,
don't you?

488
00:37:07,341 --> 00:37:08,341
I want him.

489
00:37:08,408 --> 00:37:10,025
For how much?

490
00:37:10,177 --> 00:37:12,611
The reward's
five thousand dollars.

491
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,598
Five thousand more
if we get back the loot.

492
00:37:17,434 --> 00:37:20,003
You keep a lookout
posted hereabouts?

493
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,854
I ain't got enough men.

494
00:37:21,922 --> 00:37:25,190
Willie here was chasin'
a stray horse
when he spotted you.

495
00:37:25,258 --> 00:37:29,545
Then what's to prevent McDade
from checking in anytime,

496
00:37:29,612 --> 00:37:32,464
collecting his loot,
and hightailin' it
out of here?

497
00:37:32,532 --> 00:37:33,700
Nothin'.

498
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:36,419
Yes, there is. Me.

499
00:37:36,486 --> 00:37:39,288
I'm a parlor border
in Wagon Mound.

500
00:37:39,356 --> 00:37:41,290
When McDade shows,
I'll pass you the word.

501
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:44,293
You can pick him up
and the loot in
the same package.

502
00:37:44,361 --> 00:37:47,013
How are you gonna
pass me the word?

503
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,316
You live close enough
to hear that church bell,
youngster?

504
00:37:50,384 --> 00:37:51,984
We used to hear them.

505
00:37:52,051 --> 00:37:55,304
All right.
The next time you hear it,
ride for the Sheriff here.

506
00:37:55,372 --> 00:37:58,874
And ride along back
with him if you want
to see a dead McDade.

507
00:37:58,942 --> 00:38:01,394
We'd sooner
have him alive.

508
00:38:01,461 --> 00:38:04,830
But we'll take him
any way we can get him.

509
00:38:04,898 --> 00:38:06,398
It's a deal.

MA: We're obliged
to you, mister.

512
00:38:31,157 --> 00:38:33,259
Or the other way, ma'am.

513
00:38:33,327 --> 00:38:36,378
You walked out that door,
I figured we'd seen
the last of you.

514
00:38:36,446 --> 00:38:39,398
Your Sheriff can't handle
more than one idea at a time.

515
00:38:39,466 --> 00:38:42,301
When he goes hunting
a McDade, he wouldn't
have a Kehoe at any price.

516
00:38:42,368 --> 00:38:46,205
So I noticed. Tom Larrabee
ain't no fool, mister.
Why didn't he take you in?

517
00:38:46,273 --> 00:38:48,841
Because I promised him
bigger game.

518
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,109
What game?

519
00:38:50,177 --> 00:38:51,343
The loot.

520
00:38:51,411 --> 00:38:54,947
And the man
he really came for.

521
00:38:55,015 --> 00:38:59,635
My boy? By grab,
I wouldn't put it
past you.

522
00:38:59,703 --> 00:39:00,837
He believe you?

523
00:39:00,904 --> 00:39:02,771
Why shouldn't
he believe me?

524
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:04,690
There's a reward of
ten thousand dollars.

525
00:39:04,757 --> 00:39:07,926
I've known men who'd sell
their mothers for less.

526
00:39:09,512 --> 00:39:10,846
So have I.

527
00:39:12,282 --> 00:39:14,316
Well, I reckon
we're quits, mister.

528
00:39:14,384 --> 00:39:17,653
DAN: If you say so.
Better not ring that
church bell of yours.

529
00:39:17,721 --> 00:39:19,956
That's the signal
I fixed up
with the Sheriff.

530
00:39:20,023 --> 00:39:22,124
He'll come running
if he hears it.

531
00:39:22,192 --> 00:39:23,876
You catch up your horse, and
get some supper inside you.

532
00:39:23,943 --> 00:39:27,380
You'll want to
make tracks tonight.

533
00:39:27,447 --> 00:39:30,249
You think I'm playing
the Sheriff's game?

534
00:39:31,251 --> 00:39:32,951
No, I don't think that.

535
00:39:33,019 --> 00:39:34,820
Then why not
let me hole up
here for a while,

536
00:39:34,888 --> 00:39:37,322
till certain people
forget what I look like.

537
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:40,726
I'm a light eater,
and I'll lend a hand
with the chores.

538
00:39:40,793 --> 00:39:42,612
We've done without you
for two years, mister.

539
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:45,380
I reckon we can
go on the same way.

540
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:49,284
Well, I guess
you got your reasons.

541
00:39:49,352 --> 00:39:50,720
I got 'em.

542
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:54,257
Four of 'em.

543
00:39:54,324 --> 00:39:57,927
DAN: One other thing.
When I go, my property
goes with me.

544
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:00,596
How much property
you claim to be missin'?

545
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,364
Not much, ma'am.

546
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:05,184
Not above
20 dollars worth.

547
00:40:05,252 --> 00:40:06,285
Ma.

548
00:40:08,856 --> 00:40:11,157
You say
the Sheriff's
no fool.

549
00:40:11,225 --> 00:40:14,093
Don't you think
it might occur to him to
post a lookout somewhere

550
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,528
to see that Mr. Kehoe
stays put?

551
00:40:18,131 --> 00:40:19,932
Might.

552
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,734
Mr. Kehoe didn't
have to go out there
this afternoon.

553
00:40:21,801 --> 00:40:23,402
They might have
shot him, Ma.

554
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:27,506
Do you think it's right to
make him run that risk
twice in the same day?

555
00:40:27,574 --> 00:40:29,191
The rains are due
any day now.

556
00:40:29,258 --> 00:40:31,026
Let him stay
till then.

557
00:40:31,094 --> 00:40:32,928
He can get away
under cover of
the first big storm.

558
00:40:32,996 --> 00:40:35,631
The rain will
wash out his tracks.

559
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:40,002
That suit you,
mister?

560
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:41,370
Suits me.

561
00:40:42,105 --> 00:40:43,472
All right.

562
00:40:45,174 --> 00:40:49,311
But I still got
four reasons for
wanting you off the place.

563
00:40:49,379 --> 00:40:52,314
So, just you don't
give me another one.

564
00:41:09,866 --> 00:41:11,500

I am.

566
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:16,805
Now, I always try to
recognize the courtesies,
Miss Sabina.

567

Like paying
a debt of gratitude.

568
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,678
You spoke up
for me today.
Thank you.

569
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:26,415
Better not let Ma
catch you around me.

570
00:41:26,482 --> 00:41:29,585
If the old lady had
her way, you'd have
seen the last of me.

571
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,187
I thought that's
what you wanted.

572
00:41:32,255 --> 00:41:36,425
When you went out
to the bridge today, you
were playing for a reprieve,

573
00:41:36,492 --> 00:41:39,294
and I like to see a man
get his winnings.

574
00:41:39,362 --> 00:41:41,496
Even when
you're the loser?

575
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:44,867
I'm not aware
I've lost anything,
Mr. Kehoe.

576
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:47,536
You might,
if I stay here
long enough.

577
00:41:49,272 --> 00:41:52,541
In other words,
I spoke up for you because
I find you interesting.

578
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:54,743
Is that the case
you're trying to make?

579
00:41:54,811 --> 00:41:56,912
It's a possibility.

580
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,214
Well, you're quite right.

581
00:41:59,282 --> 00:42:02,484
When you walked up
to that Sheriff,
I was impressed.

582
00:42:02,552 --> 00:42:06,088
So I decided to help you
stay around a few more days,

583
00:42:06,155 --> 00:42:09,858
just to see
what'll happen next.
You'd better go now.

584
00:42:09,926 --> 00:42:14,129
Ah, incidentally,
you do know where
it's hidden, don't you?

585
00:42:15,264 --> 00:42:17,933
Even if I did,
a hundred thousand in gold

586
00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:20,636
weighs a great deal,
Mr. Kehoe.

587
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:24,306
Now, I wouldn't be
able to do very much
about it, would I?

588
00:42:24,373 --> 00:42:28,010
Oh, you could always
melt it down and use it

how to play like that?

My pa was a preacher.
Had a tent show.

623

I used to travel
around with him.

624

Played the organ,
sang in the choir,
passed the collection box.

Well, my boys was the same.

629
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,975
I raised 'em
best as I was able.

630
00:45:47,043 --> 00:45:52,881
They knowed their Bible
as well as they knowed
their own names.

631
00:45:52,949 --> 00:45:56,551
If they didn't,
they got the tar
licked out of them.

632

They was bad.
Bad clear through.

634
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:07,079
I had to take
their part though,

635
00:46:07,146 --> 00:46:10,883
even when they was
busting God's law
and everybody else's.

636
00:46:11,918 --> 00:46:14,887
But I knowed what they was.

knowed what you was.

There ain't much
I can do for them now.

640

641
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:36,641

have a decent grave and
a decent stone to mark it.

645
00:46:56,162 --> 00:46:58,563

want no part of it.

to my boys.

648
00:47:07,473 --> 00:47:12,560
Look what it's doing
to them girls, turning
them against one another,

649
00:47:12,628 --> 00:47:17,699
filling their heads full of
greed and evil notions.

650
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:21,052
Every one of them
lusting after that gold.

651
00:47:22,738 --> 00:47:26,825
Oh, mister,
if it were mine,

652
00:47:26,893 --> 00:47:33,298
I'd sink that gold
in the river and tell
Tom Larrabee to swim for it.

No, I won't.

655
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:41,223
Because I want to
see my boy again.

656
00:47:44,894 --> 00:47:51,166

if he won't come back

you were still out hunting.

Any luck?

663
00:48:45,137 --> 00:48:49,207
Sure. I found all
that gold you were
so worried about,

664
00:48:49,275 --> 00:48:53,579
sold it in Touchstone
and came back here rich to
take the woman of my choice.

665
00:48:53,646 --> 00:48:58,049
Hmm.
Very fanciful,
Mr. Kehoe.

About so high,

669
00:49:13,833 --> 00:49:16,167
Then, I've got a chance.

670

Supposing your taste runs
to the right kind of man.

Well, I've had ample time
to think about men.

But you didn't let me
finish, Mr. Kehoe.

I'd also like a man

with a snowball in a blizzard.

 We will miss your
bright eyes and sweet smile

 For you're taking
the sunshine with you

our hearts for a while

01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:24,185
To the spring.

No.

769

That's what I figured.
Go on, Ruby,

I remember
my mother doing that.

and she only had enough
to make a braid so long.

I thought
he wanted me.

From what I hear,
he wanted
everything in sight.

Yes. Till he had it.

you didn't know?

had real different tastes

She was all sad
and innocent.

Now, she's in there,
and she knows where it is.

Oh, take me with you,
please, Dan.

Oh, take me
away from here.

He'd come back
if he wasn't dead.

863
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:30,093
It's all she's got
to bet on, Oralie. There's
a real glory in the old lady.

864
01:07:30,161 --> 01:07:32,897
She staked her whole
roll on those sons
and lost three times.

865
01:07:32,964 --> 01:07:35,599
This is her last bet,
that her boy will come home.

866
01:07:35,667 --> 01:07:39,336
But what about us, Dan?
Am I worth a bet?

I never put a dime
on anybody but myself,

use that, are you?

He's getting out of here.
I'll drive him out.

871
01:07:58,857 --> 01:08:01,324
I'm a fool to let him
stay here this long.

you wanted,
wasn't it?

879
01:09:33,819 --> 01:09:35,319
You shut your mouth.

880
01:09:35,386 --> 01:09:37,054
Didn't he take anything?

881
01:09:37,121 --> 01:09:40,558
Yes. Your good sense,
that's what he took.

882
01:09:40,625 --> 01:09:44,227
What'd you have to
hate him for? He never
did nothing to you.

What about you, Sabina?

884
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,769
You don't hold no
grief for him, huh?

885
01:09:51,837 --> 01:09:55,172
No, Ma.
Just disappointment.

886
01:09:55,239 --> 01:09:57,641
I guess I never would've
gotten him, anyway.

887
01:09:57,709 --> 01:10:00,243
But it sure was fun
thinking about it.

888

run off, Mr. Kehoe.

Without our farewells
and best wishes.

893
01:10:25,704 --> 01:10:28,338
What'd you come
back here for?

894
01:10:28,406 --> 01:10:30,407
I never left.

895
01:10:30,474 --> 01:10:32,759
Well, then you tell me
where you was.

896
01:10:32,827 --> 01:10:35,563
You've got a right to ask,
so I'll tell you.

897
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:37,598
I was taking
a last look
for the gold.

899
01:10:41,035 --> 01:10:42,637
After the way
we hid you here.

900
01:10:42,704 --> 01:10:44,939
Nobody chased me here, Ma.

901
01:10:45,006 --> 01:10:49,643
I came here to rob you.
All of you.

902
01:10:49,711 --> 01:10:52,729
You got a lot of nerve,
mister, telling me
a thing like that.

903
01:10:52,797 --> 01:10:54,498
I got to hand it
to you, ma'am.

904
01:10:54,566 --> 01:10:58,569
Wherever you hid that gold,
you sure did a good job.

905
01:10:58,637 --> 01:11:00,938
I guess I could've
spent a whole year
and never found it,

01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:03,423
unless I suddenly
got a lot smarter,

907
01:11:03,608 --> 01:11:06,026
so I'll be riding out
the way I came in.

about the stage.

911
01:11:20,108 --> 01:11:22,226
And keep those
pretty eyes bright,

912
01:11:22,294 --> 01:11:24,979
so they'll always see
everything beautiful.

913
01:11:27,281 --> 01:11:29,750
And maybe the meek
will inherit the earth,
Miss Oralie,

914
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:32,369
and a pretty girl
always has a good chance.

915
01:11:32,436 --> 01:11:35,138
So, you should be
first in line
with a golden bucket.

916
01:11:37,742 --> 01:11:41,144
Ruby, you're a danger
to the whole race of men,

917
01:11:41,212 --> 01:11:44,548
but danger's always
a fair price to pay
for excitement.

918
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:51,421
It's been
a pleasure, ma'am.

919
01:11:51,489 --> 01:11:55,893
And if your husband
happens to come back,
I'll envy him.

920
01:11:58,897 --> 01:12:04,868
Ma, I'll always count myself
a winner for having known
a tough, old cougar

921
01:12:04,936 --> 01:12:07,704
who knew how to
love her sons better
than they earned

922
01:12:07,772 --> 01:12:10,740
and how to give a stranger
more than he deserved.

923
01:12:11,993 --> 01:12:13,828
You're a rough,
old buzzard.

924
01:12:15,964 --> 01:12:22,002
But you'll let me ride out
of here, because you'll
be thinking of your son,

925
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:23,904
and I'm not much better.

926
01:12:26,257 --> 01:12:28,258
I hope he comes
back to you, Ma.

927
01:12:30,528 --> 01:12:34,397
And I hope that each
of you get the man
you're praying for.

928
01:12:34,466 --> 01:12:37,634
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll go pack my things.

929
01:12:45,910 --> 01:12:49,780
One day maybe
a smarter man than me
will ride by this way,

930
01:12:49,848 --> 01:12:52,132
and relieve you
of that gold.

931
01:12:52,299 --> 01:12:56,787
If that should happen,
don't feel too bad about it.

932
01:12:56,788 --> 01:12:59,106
It didn't belong
to you anyway.

933
01:13:05,129 --> 01:13:07,047
(THUNDER CRASHING)

934
01:13:22,914 --> 01:13:24,548
I've been expecting you.

935
01:13:24,615 --> 01:13:25,615
You're leaving
without the gold?

936
01:13:25,683 --> 01:13:27,351
What do you think?

937
01:13:27,418 --> 01:13:28,819
Cards on the table,
Mr. Kehoe.

938
01:13:28,887 --> 01:13:30,054
What are you holding?

939
01:13:30,121 --> 01:13:32,323
Aces back to back.

940
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:34,391
I know who you are
and why you're here.

941
01:13:34,459 --> 01:13:37,361
Who told you?

942
01:13:37,428 --> 01:13:42,432
This told me.
Care to say
where you got it?

943
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,568
If I did,
you wouldn't believe me.

944
01:13:44,635 --> 01:13:47,020
Cards on the table.

945
01:13:47,088 --> 01:13:50,290
I got it
from a barkeep
in Touchstone.

946
01:13:50,358 --> 01:13:52,593
I think not, Mr. Kehoe.

947
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:56,713
I think this gold piece
was given to you
by its original owner.

948
01:13:56,781 --> 01:14:00,017
I think he sent you
here to collect the
hundred thousand for him,

949
01:14:00,084 --> 01:14:02,236
only you decided
to deal him out.

950
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:06,406
I see. You got it
all figured out.

951
01:14:06,474 --> 01:14:09,476
I'm willing to split
the gold with you,
half and half.

952
01:14:09,544 --> 01:14:10,811
Fine.

953
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:12,279
It's a deal?

954
01:14:12,346 --> 01:14:14,849
It's a deal.
There's only one hitch.

955
01:14:14,916 --> 01:14:16,750
I don't know
where the gold is.

956
01:14:16,818 --> 01:14:18,068
I do.

957
01:14:19,287 --> 01:14:21,021
How?

958
01:14:21,089 --> 01:14:23,290
I've been here two years,
Mr. Kehoe.

959
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:24,858
What kept you
from cashing in?

960
01:14:24,925 --> 01:14:28,345
I needed a man
with a strong arm
to help me.

961
01:14:28,413 --> 01:14:30,113
Half and half?

962
01:14:30,181 --> 01:14:31,865
Half and half.

963
01:14:34,318 --> 01:14:36,987
Miss Sabina,
you're a woman
after my own heart.

964
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:41,241
Tougher than whang leather,
smarter than spit,
and colder than January.

965
01:14:43,194 --> 01:14:46,029
You've described me
correctly, Mr. Kehoe.

966
01:14:46,097 --> 01:14:48,965
Tough enough
to make my own way
in a man's world,

967
01:14:49,033 --> 01:14:53,637
smart enough to scheme
my way into the affections
of a lonesome old woman,

968
01:14:53,704 --> 01:14:57,774
and cold enough
to sell her out
and sleep sound on it.

969
01:14:57,842 --> 01:15:00,410
We're two of a kind,
Mr. Kehoe.

970
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:03,847
Thank you. I'm in.
Where to?

971
01:15:03,915 --> 01:15:05,799
Ride out of here now.

972
01:15:05,867 --> 01:15:08,702
When everything's dark,
come back,
hitch up the buckboard,

973
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:10,938
take it across the bridge
and hide it there.

974
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:13,206
When it's safe,
I'll meet you.

975
01:15:18,914 --> 01:15:23,316
Whoa, son. Whoa.
Whoa, boy.

976
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:28,388
Ma, he's on his way.

977
01:16:07,011 --> 01:16:09,112
Anybody see you?
No. Nobody.

978
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:11,715
When it comes to thieving,
there's nothing like
experienced help.

979
01:16:11,783 --> 01:16:12,849
Come on.
I'll show you
where it is.

980
01:16:12,917 --> 01:16:14,918
You sure you can?
Quite sure.

981
01:16:14,986 --> 01:16:16,787
I wouldn't bet
any money on it.

982
01:16:16,854 --> 01:16:20,423
You know,
that gold just walked right up
and whispered into my ear.

983
01:16:23,094 --> 01:16:24,627
Why, you knew!

984
01:16:24,696 --> 01:16:27,330
All the time
you were telling us
your fine speech.

985
01:16:27,398 --> 01:16:30,100
Well, I always believe
in giving value received.

986
01:16:30,168 --> 01:16:32,869
Well, you got what you
came for. You didn't have
to share it with anybody.

987
01:16:32,937 --> 01:16:34,671
Why are you
waiting here for me?

988
01:16:34,739 --> 01:16:37,340
Ah, there's no point in
winning just for the game.
Not when you're alone.

989
01:16:37,408 --> 01:16:38,641
It could have been
one of the others.

990
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:40,944
Not for fifty thousand
dollars worth.

991
01:16:41,012 --> 01:16:43,580
So, you paid your money
and took your choice.

992
01:16:44,816 --> 01:16:47,550
Why not? You offered
me half, didn't you?

993
01:16:47,618 --> 01:16:49,419
Now you're talking
like an honest man.

994
01:16:49,486 --> 01:16:51,888
They say that's the kind
you can't cheat.

995
01:16:54,309 --> 01:16:57,895
Ma! Hey, Ma!
Sabina ain't
in her room.

996
01:16:58,830 --> 01:17:00,464
She's gone,
I tell you.

997
01:17:07,739 --> 01:17:09,005
(EXCLAIMS)

01:17:11,776 --> 01:17:14,277
Dirty, thieving rat!

It's been there
all the time.

1000
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:18,749
And they won't keep it,
I promise them that.

1001
01:17:20,084 --> 01:17:22,853
That blame Kehoe
has laid his own trap.

DAN: How does it
feel to be rich?

1003
01:17:27,425 --> 01:17:29,359
You ought to know.

1004
01:17:29,427 --> 01:17:34,064
Yeah. I got it all.
The pick of the litter and
all the gold in the world.

1005
01:17:35,366 --> 01:17:37,133
(LAUGHING)
What's so funny?

1006
01:17:37,201 --> 01:17:39,536
If that last McDade turns
out to be your husband,

1007
01:17:39,604 --> 01:17:42,906
he'll be after me
like a storm of wildcats.

1008
01:17:42,974 --> 01:17:45,308
Boone was the one
who escaped,

1009
01:17:45,376 --> 01:17:48,044
but he won't be coming
after you. He's dead.

(EXCLAIMS)

1011
01:17:49,914 --> 01:17:53,283
And he wasn't my husband.

1012
01:17:53,351 --> 01:17:57,220
The closest I ever came to
marrying Boone was watching
him get drunk once in Denver,

1013
01:17:57,288 --> 01:17:59,589
the night before
he was killed.

1014
01:17:59,657 --> 01:18:02,192
He told me about the gold,
so I went after it.

1015
01:18:02,259 --> 01:18:04,994
Passed myself off
as married to him.

1016
01:18:05,062 --> 01:18:06,563
The truth?

1017
01:18:06,631 --> 01:18:08,298
The truth.

1018
01:18:08,366 --> 01:18:09,633

We're a pair
of beauties,
aren't we, Dan?

1020
01:18:13,805 --> 01:18:16,072
How'd you find out
where the gold was?

1021
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:19,275
I watched Ma
when she went out
to check it. You?

1022
01:18:19,344 --> 01:18:22,979
The same.
Except I had to wait
for the right man,

1023
01:18:23,047 --> 01:18:25,349
and in walked
Dan Kehoe.

and they'll be

A reasonable man
always settles

for a half, a quarter,
or whatever he can get.

1033

Here, this one is ours.

01:19:45,613 --> 01:19:47,381
You know where the mission
is outside Las Piedras?

1036
01:19:47,448 --> 01:19:49,115
I'll find it.

1037
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:51,117
Take that to the priest,
tell him to put it
with the rest of my money.

I'll meet you there later.

(URGING HORSES)

Morning. Sure glad
to see you gentlemen.

1041
01:20:08,937 --> 01:20:12,605
LARRABEE: You just
keep your hand clear
of that gun belt.

1042
01:20:12,673 --> 01:20:15,108
There's the loot, Sheriff.
All accounted for.

1043
01:20:15,176 --> 01:20:18,712
We'll see about that.
I figured we had a McDade.

1044
01:20:18,779 --> 01:20:20,214
Who rang that bell?
I did.

1045
01:20:20,281 --> 01:20:22,082
You did?

1046
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:25,485
Yeah. I found the gold
and set out to return the
same to the rightful owner.

1047
01:20:25,553 --> 01:20:26,920
People being what
they are these days,

1048
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:28,788
I figured it wasn't safe
carrying all that loot

1049
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:30,423
without a proper escort.

1050
01:20:30,491 --> 01:20:33,126
So, I rang the bell
for help, and you
gentlemen did your duty.

1051
01:20:33,194 --> 01:20:34,678
I thank you.

1052
01:20:34,746 --> 01:20:36,847
Well, if you wanted
us so bad, why did
you run so fast?

1053
01:20:36,914 --> 01:20:40,167
Yeah, well now, Sheriff,
you might have noticed that
I was traveling with a lady.

1054
01:20:40,234 --> 01:20:43,353
It turned out she was
more interested in the gold
than she was in me,

1055
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:45,188
so she pulled a gun
and tried to make me
run for it.

1056
01:20:45,256 --> 01:20:48,074
It took a lot of fast
talking to make her see
the right way of things.

1057
01:20:48,142 --> 01:20:51,578
One of them
McDade widows.
Which one was it?

1058
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:54,915
Now, Sheriff, you know
a man of honor can't answer
a question like that.

1059
01:20:54,982 --> 01:20:56,883
Sheriff,
five thousand
is missing.

1060
01:20:56,951 --> 01:21:00,620
Yeah. My property, sir.
Legal reward for
returning the gold.

1061
01:21:00,688 --> 01:21:02,556
Oh, I reckon he's right.

1062
01:21:02,623 --> 01:21:05,442
Hey, Sheriff, you know,
about those McDade women...

1063
01:21:05,509 --> 01:21:07,760
You know, it takes a man
like you and me
to understand them.

1064
01:21:07,828 --> 01:21:10,997
Driven half wild
with greed and loneliness,
the poor souls,

1065
01:21:11,065 --> 01:21:13,467
they need all the charity
we can give them.

1066
01:21:13,534 --> 01:21:17,554
Well, it's been
a pleasure to do business
with an honest man.

1067
01:21:17,621 --> 01:21:19,255
Well, thank you.
Good morning.

1068
01:21:19,323 --> 01:21:20,557
Good morning.

1069
01:21:23,661 --> 01:21:26,529
Well, now there's a
real fine gentleman.

1070
01:21:26,597 --> 01:21:29,432
You don't meet them
like that no more.

1071
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,334
All right, let's load up the gold.

1072
01:21:31,402 --> 01:21:32,402
Come on.

1073
01:21:44,882 --> 01:21:46,683
All the saints in heaven!

1074
01:21:46,751 --> 01:21:49,035
Can this be a miracle, my son?

1075
01:21:49,103 --> 01:21:51,220
She came to tell me
you'd been hanged.

1076
01:21:51,288 --> 01:21:52,756
Who told you?

1077
01:21:52,823 --> 01:21:55,175
Your lovely wife. Her,
with the flaming red hair.

1078
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:56,259
My wife?

1079
01:21:56,326 --> 01:21:57,844
She claimed to be.

1080
01:21:57,911 --> 01:21:58,995
She showed me
the wedding ring

1081
01:21:59,063 --> 01:22:00,346
when she came
for your possessions.

1082
01:22:00,414 --> 01:22:02,265
You didn't give her my money?

1083
01:22:02,332 --> 01:22:06,436
Yes. Every cent of it.
Oh, me poor frazzled brain.

1084
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:08,821
Where did she go?

1085
01:22:08,889 --> 01:22:11,891
What a bundle
of tricks she was,
now that I think of it.

1086
01:22:11,959 --> 01:22:13,726
She said she was going
to Albuquerque,

1087
01:22:13,794 --> 01:22:16,696
but she tore off
like a wild hare
to the border.

1090
01:22:40,571 --> 01:22:41,871
Hey, Kehoe!

1091
01:23:02,326 --> 01:23:04,660
Here's your cash, partner.

1092
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:08,064
That's right generous
of you.

1093
01:23:08,132 --> 01:23:11,468
You know, for a while there,
Miss Sabina, I almost
took you for a crook.

1094
01:23:11,535 --> 01:23:14,237
You've got
a suspicious mind.

1095
01:23:14,305 --> 01:23:17,840
Well, you had the money,
what did you wait for?

1096
01:23:17,908 --> 01:23:23,980
Like a fella said once,
"There's no fun just winning
the game when you're alone."

1097
01:23:24,047 --> 01:23:27,950
Oh, I see. You figure
we'd be fit company
for each other?

1098
01:23:28,018 --> 01:23:30,420
Haven't I proved that, Mr. Kehoe?

1099
01:23:31,589 --> 01:23:32,589
Get in?

1100
01:23:34,691 --> 01:23:36,559
This will be a rare education.
