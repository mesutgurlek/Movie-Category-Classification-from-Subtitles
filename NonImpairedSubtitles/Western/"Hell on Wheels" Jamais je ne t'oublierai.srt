1
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:01,403
Anybody there?

2
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,444
Drop the rifle.

3
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,537
Turn around.

4
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,910
You Harper?

5
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,328
No, sir.

6
00:01:20,646 --> 00:01:22,082
Where is he?

7
00:01:24,315 --> 00:01:25,711
Who wants to know?

8
00:01:27,152 --> 00:01:28,895
I'm your new foreman.

9
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,963
Why should I believe you?

10
00:01:31,088 --> 00:01:32,932
Well, I guess Mr. Durant
didn't have time

11
00:01:33,057 --> 00:01:34,867
to come out and tell you his self.

12
00:01:34,992 --> 00:01:36,336
Durant?

13
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:37,737
Yeah, he told me to come
look for Harper.

14
00:01:37,862 --> 00:01:39,238
Why?

15
00:01:39,363 --> 00:01:41,740
That's his business.

16
00:01:41,865 --> 00:01:43,353
Where is he?

17
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,565
Harper hightailed it.

18
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,879
When?

19
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:49,484
- A few hours ago.
- Which way?

20
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,611
North.

21
00:01:51,777 --> 00:01:54,281
Towards the Ridge.

22
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,116
Is it true about Johnson?

23
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,951
Yeah, it's true.

24
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:00,620
What's the world comin' to, sir?

25
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:04,128
The world ain't
comin' to nothin', son.

26
00:02:04,253 --> 00:02:06,460
Same as it ever was.

27
00:02:34,236 --> 00:02:35,572
Harper!

28
00:02:37,084 --> 00:02:39,161
Harper!

29
00:02:39,286 --> 00:02:40,886
Is that you?

30
00:03:15,386 --> 00:03:16,780
Whoa.

31
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,365
Uh!

32
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,044
Uhh!

33
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:34,714
Shit!

34
00:03:48,484 --> 00:03:49,646
Shh shh shh.

35
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,690
Shh shh shh.

36
00:03:56,492 --> 00:03:58,196
Shh shh.

38
00:05:05,224 --> 00:05:07,467
Mrs. Bell?

39
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:11,738
Mrs. Bell, it's me, Thomas Durant.

40
00:05:11,863 --> 00:05:15,190
They said you were up here.

41
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:19,903
I know who you are...
Mr. Durant.

42
00:05:22,273 --> 00:05:23,949
The whole world's been looking

43
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:27,577
for you and, uh...
Here you are.

44
00:05:29,343 --> 00:05:31,331
And here I am.

45
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:40,465
Uh.

46
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,932
You must excuse my appearance.

47
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:53,411
We need to get you
some medical attention.

48
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:56,231
Please... allow me to escort you.

49
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:05,615
Ah, you... you won't
need this anymore.

50
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,495
Your ordeal is over.

51
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,680
My deepest condolences
on your loss, Mrs. Bell.

52
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:32,934
Thank you.

53
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:36,017
How in God's name

54
00:06:36,142 --> 00:06:38,553
did you make your way back here?

55
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:43,824
Uh... can't remember his name, um...

56
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:47,027
A Southerner, I think.

57
00:06:47,152 --> 00:06:48,395
Bohannon?

58
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,323
Yes, I believe so.

59
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,790
Hmm.

60
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,150
Did I tell ya about me rendez-vous

61
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:12,682
with the tattooed harlot?

62
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:17,356
The Scarlet whore of Babylon

63
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:19,658
had nothing on this lass, I tell ya.

64
00:07:19,783 --> 00:07:21,316
Give us the particulars, man.

65
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:25,230
I have never seen nothin' like
it in all me life, boys.

66
00:07:25,355 --> 00:07:29,699
She used her organ like a velvet
hand on me tally whacker.

67
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,869
And to hear her tell it,

68
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:34,238
she's practiced these
dark arts of love

69
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:36,039
on all manner of beasts and men.

70
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:39,542
Chinks and monkeys and horses

71
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,670
have all known
the pleasure of her touch.

72
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:45,249
In fact, there is but one creature

73
00:07:45,374 --> 00:07:47,926
in all the world with whom
she refuses to copulate.

74
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:49,442
And what would that be?

75
00:07:49,718 --> 00:07:51,096
Well, the common American
nigger of course.

76
00:07:51,312 --> 00:07:52,347
Damn it, I've heard enough...

77
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,807
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

78
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:03,189
All right.

79
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:13,575
Never thought I'd see you again.

80
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,401
You kill him?

81
00:08:17,404 --> 00:08:19,914
Where you going?

82
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:23,545
Sooner or later,
you gotta give us some orders, boss man.

83
00:08:24,777 --> 00:08:27,254
The demise of head
surveyor Robert Bell

84
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:29,724
and party, a great loss to railroad.

85
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:31,125
Stop.

86
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,562
Bell's work must continue.
Stop.

87
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:37,831
Send funds for new surveyors at once.

88
00:08:37,956 --> 00:08:39,269
Stop.

89
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,359
What news?

90
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:52,445
Payroll is late... work
disorganized and slow.

91
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,014
This new foreman of yours
just up and leave yesterday.

92
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:57,662
Nobody seen him since.

93
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,748
He rode out to rendez-vous
with the tree cutting party.

94
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:05,795
He informed me yesterday
at our morning briefing.

95
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:08,025
There's something about this man.

96
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,008
He's up to something.

97
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,430
He crossed paths with Mrs. Bell.

98
00:09:12,555 --> 00:09:13,665
Bohannon?

99
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,054
He brought her in.

100
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,264
Did she have the maps?

101
00:09:16,492 --> 00:09:17,568
Shh.

102
00:09:17,693 --> 00:09:19,267
She's right next door.

103
00:09:21,863 --> 00:09:25,442
No, she didn't have them.

104
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:29,152
How will you reach the
Pacific without them?

105
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,653
You let me worry about that.

106
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:36,743
Oh, there's a supply train
arriving tomorrow morning

107
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,454
with a shipment of black powder.

108
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,459
My men will meet the train
and guard it all morning.

109
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:52,425
New telegram to my damn stock broker.

110
00:09:52,592 --> 00:10:00,241
Invest $147,000 in R&R
railroad stock as discussed.

111
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,851
Stop.

112
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,821
Ahem.

113
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,114
Mrs. Bell?

114
00:10:20,885 --> 00:10:22,830
Are you all right in there?

115
00:10:24,455 --> 00:10:27,834
Yes, thank you, Mr. Durant.

116
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:31,137
I, uh, ahem, I brought out my...

117
00:10:31,262 --> 00:10:34,841
Personal Chef from Delmonico's
in New York City.

118
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:39,778
I wondered if you would like to
join me for dinner this evening?

119
00:10:39,903 --> 00:10:42,539
Yes, that would be wonderful.

120
00:10:47,978 --> 00:10:50,483
Is there anything else
I can get for you?

121
00:10:54,184 --> 00:10:59,064
Actually, has the reward
been given to anyone?

122
00:10:59,189 --> 00:11:01,995
Uh, I believe it
belongs to Mr. Bohannon.

123
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,868
I don't think he's claimed it.

124
00:11:03,993 --> 00:11:05,456
Would you like me
to see that he gets it?

125
00:11:05,622 --> 00:11:07,372
No.

126
00:11:07,497 --> 00:11:10,378
There's someone else who deserves it.

127
00:11:42,795 --> 00:11:44,639
Stay off my corner, sweetheart,

128
00:11:44,764 --> 00:11:47,333
unless she wants her
own crib, right, ladies?

129
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,085
Leave her alone.

130
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:52,481
What do you say, blondie?

131
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:54,516
Them Injuns teach you anything?

132
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:56,518
Leave her alone!

133
00:11:56,643 --> 00:11:58,551
Hey, I'm sorry, ma'am.

134
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,471
These dirty whores don't know
a lady when they see one.

135
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:09,029
Where there is hatred,
let me show love.

136
00:12:09,154 --> 00:12:12,333
Where there is injury, pardon.

137
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,276
Where there is doubt, faith.

138
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:17,203
Amen.

139
00:12:17,328 --> 00:12:19,229
Joseph?

140
00:12:20,465 --> 00:12:22,799
Mrs. Bell?

141
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,914
You look like you're
feeling much better.

142
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,458
It's amazing what
a little soap and water can do.

143
00:12:32,008 --> 00:12:34,003
I didn't mean to leave that night.

144
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:35,454
But that man...

145
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,340
There's no need to explain.

146
00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:40,176
You've cut your hair.

147
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,793
Yes, ma'am.

148
00:12:41,918 --> 00:12:43,012
Did you come to pray?

149
00:12:43,178 --> 00:12:46,631
No, um... I came to give you this.

150
00:12:46,756 --> 00:12:49,099
It's the reward money.
No, please, take it.

151
00:12:49,224 --> 00:12:50,645
I can't.

152
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,078
There'll be no trouble,
nobody knows it was you.

153
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,339
No, that's not it.

154
00:12:55,464 --> 00:12:57,860
I'm not a bounty hunter.

155
00:12:58,026 --> 00:12:59,743
It's my duty to help.

156
00:12:59,868 --> 00:13:02,979
Joseph, that money will
buy a lot of bibles.

157
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:05,868
Mrs. Bell, Reverend Cole.

158
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:07,941
Reverend.

159
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,094
Your donations are always welcome.

160
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,708
Please.

161
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:14,794
Thank you.

162
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,838
So, this is the fair-haired
maiden of the West?

163
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,589
I beg your pardon?

164
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:31,139
"Robert Bell fought valiantly to save

165
00:13:31,264 --> 00:13:32,478
the virtue of his beautiful wife,

166
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:36,702
killing a savage
with his final breath.

167
00:13:38,904 --> 00:13:40,653
Is that not how it happened?

168
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,017
Yes.

169
00:13:43,142 --> 00:13:47,118
My husband... saved my life.

170
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:50,037
Well... what about
the rest of it? Um...

171
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:52,957
Outnumbered 10 to one?

172
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,834
Sullied by the savages?

173
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,544
I didn't write it.

174
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,045
But this is true?

175
00:13:58,211 --> 00:13:59,422
Of course not.

176
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,841
Well, Indians will die
as a result of this.

177
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,704
The Indians attacked us.

178
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:06,471
If they die, they will
be to blame, not me.

179
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,638
Maybe you've heard of
the Sand Creek massacre?

180
00:14:07,804 --> 00:14:09,265
I didn't come here to speak of this.

181
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,745
You know, the Cheyenne were
flying the American flag

182
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,579
over their camp and it
didn't stop the U.S. Calvary

183
00:14:13,704 --> 00:14:16,314
from killing 100 innocent
women and children.

184
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,383
That was a terrible
thing that happened.

185
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:18,900
I wasn't a part of it.

186
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,220
Please, I'm just saying,

187
00:14:20,345 --> 00:14:21,611
try to see the bigger picture.

188
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,822
My husband was slaughtered
right in front of me.

189
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:28,075
It's a little difficult
to see the bigger picture.

190
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:29,886
Good day.

191
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:01,115
Hey.

192
00:15:02,784 --> 00:15:04,594
Hey, hey.

193
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:08,155
That son of a bitch
got away because of you.

194
00:15:09,624 --> 00:15:11,233
Because of me?
How you figure that?

195
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:14,121
You killed Johnson before
he could give me Harper's name.

196
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,372
Oh.

197
00:15:17,497 --> 00:15:21,045
Well, I... I killed Johnson
before he killed you.

198
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,611
Now...

199
00:15:22,736 --> 00:15:24,423
But I would have got
a name out of him.

200
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:25,967
He would have blowed your brains out.

201
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,182
And then I could have killed Harper

202
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:28,761
before he had a chance to run.

203
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:31,277
You're either drunk or crazy or both.

204
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:37,645
You have any idea
what they took from me?

205
00:15:39,585 --> 00:15:43,025
They ain't took nothin' from you
that ain't been took from me.

206
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,129
Fly away home, just a nickel a show.

207
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:56,076
Feel the mist against your cheeks.

208
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,749
Give it a rest, Mick.

209
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:04,328
They're sick and bloody tired
of the mighty Shannon

210
00:16:04,453 --> 00:16:09,051
and the blarney stone...
The bloody Irish bog.

211
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:11,801
Well, then we need new slides.

212
00:16:11,926 --> 00:16:13,806
New slides cost money.

213
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:15,600
You've got some copper
squirreled away, brother,

214
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,767
now's the time to tell me.

215
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:18,686
Maybe we should relocate.

216
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,230
The rent is low down by
the slaughterhouse, right?

217
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:22,478
The rent was low
in Wicklow, too, Mick.

218
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:26,705
We're done with that shit.

219
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,281
It was a high rent dream
that brought us out here.

220
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:34,535
I'm not going to let that big
Swedish bastard kill our dream.

221
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:36,324
Am I right?

222
00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:38,873
Mick?

223
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,167
Hold on now.

224
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,753
I just had a grand idea.

225
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,671
Oh, no.

226
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:47,424
It's a business idea.

227
00:16:48,894 --> 00:16:51,204
Ideas ain't your strong suit, Mick.

228
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:52,720
Ah, ha ha.

229
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,040
This one's golden.

230
00:16:54,165 --> 00:16:55,640
I'll prove it to ya.

231
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:02,021
I've taken the liberty of
telegraphing your family in England.

232
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,950
I just wanted them
to know you were well.

233
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:06,853
Thank you, Mr. Durant.

234
00:17:06,978 --> 00:17:10,112
I'm afraid you'll grow
weary of my gratitude.

235
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:13,783
I don't know what news of
the attack may have reached them.

236
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,953
I didn't want your father
worrying needlessly.

237
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,365
I'm sure my father was happy to hear

238
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,167
he was right...

239
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,960
About me coming to America.

240
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:26,796
He was against it, no doubt?

241
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:30,307
My father had every aspect
of my life planned out,

242
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:32,051
including whom I should marry.

243
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:36,337
Robert interrupted those plans.

244
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,228
I saw him give a lecture

245
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,481
at the British Museum
of Natural History.

246
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,782
He spoke of the American West.

247
00:17:54,022 --> 00:17:57,066
I fell in love...

248
00:17:57,191 --> 00:18:00,746
With him and with this land.

249
00:18:00,912 --> 00:18:04,706
I, too, came under Robert's spell.

250
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:09,645
His dream of a transcontinental
railroad became my own.

251
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,906
Then it's a shame you two had
such a terrible falling out.

252
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:18,180
Well, Robert and I didn't
see eye to eye on everything.

253
00:18:18,346 --> 00:18:22,518
Such as how to squeeze every
last dollar out of the railroad.

254
00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:30,317
Mrs. Bell, your husband
was a starry-eyed dreamer.

255
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:32,695
I am a realist.

256
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,735
Without me, his dream would
have remained just that.

257
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,325
Thank you for your hospitality,
Mr. Durant.

258
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:41,632
Mrs. Bell, please, I'm sorry.

259
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,373
I didn't mean to impugn Robert.

260
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:48,046
Yes, he needed me,
but I needed him also.

261
00:18:48,171 --> 00:18:52,089
Our marriage wasn't
perfect, but it worked.

262
00:18:54,257 --> 00:18:57,322
Mrs. Bell, there's nowhere
for you to go out there.

263
00:18:57,447 --> 00:19:00,765
Please... accept my apology.

264
00:19:02,252 --> 00:19:05,253
Do me the honor
of remaining my guest.

265
00:19:53,499 --> 00:19:54,944
Why you following me?

266
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,612
You tryin' to get me killed?

267
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,580
Mister, you do that all by yourself

268
00:19:58,705 --> 00:20:00,616
bustin' in on a white cathouse.

269
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:01,909
What you want then?

270
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,441
Huh?

271
00:20:04,744 --> 00:20:06,455
You still want to give me a roll?

272
00:20:08,246 --> 00:20:10,876
I thought you were mighty clear
on where you stood on that.

273
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:14,828
Honey, I'm already a cut rate whore
on account of my beauty marks.

274
00:20:14,953 --> 00:20:19,969
My white customers know I laid
with a colored fella, I starve.

275
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:25,405
But... if you got a dollar,

276
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,436
then... maybe we can do
one off the books.

277
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:32,815
Now you tryin' to get us both killed.

278
00:20:59,262 --> 00:21:00,467
Look at him.

279
00:21:11,374 --> 00:21:14,017
Drop your hanky...

280
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:16,150
Madam?

281
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:21,549
Ah!

282
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:33,236
Now, now, boys.

283
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:36,705
I doubt Mr. Durant

284
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:39,908
wants his new foreman assassinated.

285
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:41,944
He shot my dang ear off, Swede.

286
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:43,936
Too bad it was not your tongue.

287
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:47,172
Move aside.

288
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:53,054
Mr. Bolan, you need
to leave here right now.

289
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,214
Damn it.

290
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:02,296
Come on, Tommy, let's go.

291
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,034
Let's go. Come on.

292
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,307
Magnolias.

293
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:17,044
They grow just outside
the gates of the Andersonville.

294
00:22:17,535 --> 00:22:23,607
Some nights, their perfume was almost
enough to mask the awful stench.

295
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:33,192
Oh, you're a difficult man
to cipher, Mr. Bohannon.

296
00:22:33,317 --> 00:22:38,148
Let me buy you a drink.

297
00:22:38,314 --> 00:22:40,332
I won't turn down free liquor.

298
00:22:40,457 --> 00:22:41,966
Need another glass.

299
00:22:42,091 --> 00:22:43,268
Thank you.

300
00:22:43,393 --> 00:22:44,893
No.

301
00:22:48,831 --> 00:22:53,747
I know you killed Johnson.

302
00:22:55,471 --> 00:22:58,182
Hmm.

303
00:22:58,307 --> 00:23:02,881
What I do not know yet is why.

304
00:23:05,925 --> 00:23:08,191
Who are you?

305
00:23:08,316 --> 00:23:10,723
Hmm?

306
00:23:14,058 --> 00:23:17,057
Ah, I'll figure it out.

307
00:23:17,478 --> 00:23:19,023
You let me know when
you do, all right?

308
00:23:22,108 --> 00:23:26,208
Oh, by golly, you will be
the first to know, hmm?

309
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:33,537
Oh, but in the meantime,

310
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:37,750
I've got a business
proposition for you.

311
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,593
Now, there is a... there
is some black powder coming in

312
00:23:45,718 --> 00:23:49,178
on the train...
Tomorrow morning.

313
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,930
That is your cut.

314
00:23:52,096 --> 00:23:57,837
And you just look the other
way while my boys unload,

315
00:23:57,962 --> 00:24:02,107
uh, you know, a few barrels.

316
00:24:02,273 --> 00:24:07,581
Is that some of that... immoral
mathematics, Mr. Swede?

317
00:24:07,706 --> 00:24:08,572
Huh? Hmm.

318
00:24:09,172 --> 00:24:10,449
Hmm.

319
00:24:11,975 --> 00:24:15,120
All right...
You got a deal.

320
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:16,678
Yeah.

321
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,708
For another five.

322
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,137
Well, well, well.

323
00:24:32,303 --> 00:24:34,796
Lookee.

324
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:04,711
How them Injuns treat you?

325
00:25:04,877 --> 00:25:08,233
Well... they were people.

326
00:25:08,358 --> 00:25:10,534
You know what people are like.

327
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:15,406
Some of them are good and...
Some of them ain't so good.

328
00:25:15,531 --> 00:25:18,877
What about the ones that
put that mark on you?

329
00:25:19,002 --> 00:25:22,413
Well... this wasn't that bad.

330
00:25:22,538 --> 00:25:23,856
Did it hurt?

331
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:28,009
Not as much as a lot of things.

332
00:25:38,186 --> 00:25:41,874
Folks be telling all kind of
tales 'bout what that mean.

333
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,294
Well... what do you think it means?

334
00:25:47,628 --> 00:25:53,299
I reckon it mean you
was a slave... just like me.

335
00:25:55,368 --> 00:26:02,519
<i>Tuunuchch... hamokm...
Ahatch... asentk.</i>

336
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:07,522
It's three blankets and a horse.

337
00:26:07,647 --> 00:26:10,549
That's what I was worth to 'em.

338
00:26:15,587 --> 00:26:19,723
Them eyes of yours alone
worth a hundred horses.

339
00:26:21,427 --> 00:26:22,706
They was fools.

340
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:26,473
Maybe there's another
way of looking at it.

341
00:26:26,598 --> 00:26:31,510
Maybe this mark was their way
of giving me their name,

342
00:26:31,635 --> 00:26:35,881
telling the world
that I was one of them.

343
00:26:36,006 --> 00:26:37,984
Hmm.

344
00:26:38,109 --> 00:26:40,910
I got my master's name, too,

345
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:44,436
but I sure as hell ain't one of them.

346
00:26:46,483 --> 00:26:54,446
Best I can tell... you ain't
one of nobody or nothin'.

347
00:26:55,992 --> 00:26:57,741
Just like you.

348
00:26:57,961 --> 00:26:59,994
Hmm?

349
00:27:06,768 --> 00:27:10,171
Nothin' like two peas in a pod, huh?

350
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,301
40 miles.

351
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:17,587
40 miles.

352
00:27:17,712 --> 00:27:18,788
Who came up with that number?

353
00:27:18,913 --> 00:27:21,591
It's completely arbitrary.

354
00:27:23,318 --> 00:27:25,261
I don't have enough
to worry about with savages

355
00:27:25,386 --> 00:27:27,980
and the cutthroats
I have working for me.

356
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,607
It must be hard to be you.

357
00:27:37,464 --> 00:27:40,742
Those milksops in Washington,

358
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:44,813
I begged them for more troops,
but get none.

359
00:27:44,938 --> 00:27:47,915
And my investors, do you
think they'll give me

360
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,550
even a penny for new surveyors?

361
00:27:49,675 --> 00:27:50,711
Hmm.

362
00:27:50,976 --> 00:27:52,377
Hmm.

363
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:04,221
They haven't got your guts, Thomas.

364
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:11,732
Robert was a lucky man
to have you at his side.

365
00:28:13,598 --> 00:28:17,863
Thomas... are the new surveyors
to finish Robert's work?

366
00:28:18,102 --> 00:28:19,740
Yes, this time.

367
00:28:20,003 --> 00:28:21,947
Forgive me.

368
00:28:22,072 --> 00:28:25,151
I thought the lion's share of
Robert's work was finished.

369
00:28:25,276 --> 00:28:29,055
Yes, it was, but he still
owed me some surveys.

370
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,961
I think he was keeping them from
me because of our falling out.

371
00:28:33,127 --> 00:28:34,551
I see.

372
00:28:35,918 --> 00:28:38,091
What kind of surveys?

373
00:28:39,922 --> 00:28:42,257
There.

374
00:28:43,554 --> 00:28:45,903
The Rocky Mountains?

375
00:28:46,028 --> 00:28:50,896
It's a 14,000-foot barrier
of stone and snow...

376
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:57,152
But I think Robert
knew the way through.

377
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:03,187
But when you didn't
have his maps, I...

378
00:29:03,312 --> 00:29:06,523
Oh, you poor man.

379
00:29:06,648 --> 00:29:09,164
You must have been crushed.

380
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:13,028
I was.

381
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:19,049
That's not to say I wasn't
elated to see you safe and sound.

382
00:29:22,697 --> 00:29:24,372
Let's have a song, shall we?

383
00:29:24,497 --> 00:29:25,639
Henri?

384
00:29:26,394 --> 00:29:29,896
<i>Chante quelque chose pour la danse,
s'il vous plaît.</i>

385
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:41,211
<i>À la Claire fontaine,</i>

386
00:29:41,336 --> 00:29:44,542
<i>m'en allant promener,</i>

387
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,723
<i>j'ai trouvé l'eau si belle</i>

388
00:29:47,848 --> 00:29:51,873
<i>que je m'y suis baignée.</i>

389
00:29:52,385 --> 00:29:54,543
<i>Il y a longtemps que je t'aime,</i>

390
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,418
<i>jamais je ne t'oublierai.</i>

391
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:07,530
<i>Sous les feuilles d'un chêne,
je me suis fait sécher.</i>

392
00:30:09,153 --> 00:30:15,235
<i>Sur la plus haute branche,
un rossignol chantait.</i>

393
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:26,106
<i>Il y a longtemps que je t'aime
et jamais je ne t'oublierai.</i>

394
00:30:34,357 --> 00:30:40,889
<i>Tu as le coeur a rire,
et moi, je l'ai à pleurer.</i>

395
00:30:42,143 --> 00:30:50,431
<i>Il y a longtemps que je t'aime
et jamais je ne t'oublierai.</i>

396
00:30:50,556 --> 00:30:57,178
<i>J'ai perdu mon ami
sans l'avoir mérité,</i>

397
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:05,717
<i>pour un bouquet de roses,
que je lui refusais.</i>

398
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:15,289
<i>Chante, rossignol, chante,
toi qui as le coeur gai,</i>

399
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:21,926
<i>tu as le coeur a rire,
et moi, je l'ai à pleurer.</i>

400
00:31:24,435 --> 00:31:28,197
<i>Il y a longtemps que je t'aime,</i>

401
00:31:28,842 --> 00:31:35,701
<i>jamais je ne t'oublierai.</i>

402
00:31:37,692 --> 00:31:40,754
<i>Il y a longtemps que je t'aime,</i>

403
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:48,573
<i>jamais je ne t'oublierai.</i>

404
00:32:13,722 --> 00:32:16,834
Dark night here in hell,
brothers and sisters.

405
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:18,602
Come on in.

406
00:32:18,727 --> 00:32:24,008
I got eggs, I got coffee,
I got scripture.

407
00:32:24,133 --> 00:32:26,610
Oh, Mr. Bohannon.

408
00:32:27,778 --> 00:32:29,155
Hi, Mr. Bohannon.

409
00:32:29,321 --> 00:32:31,714
Did the good Lord
save you from hanging

410
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,994
so you could drown
yourself in whiskey?

411
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,387
It's a little late for proselytizing,
ain't it, preacher?

412
00:32:37,512 --> 00:32:39,055
You know, you were right.

413
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,456
You know,
you don't deserve forgiveness.

414
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:41,825
Oh, yeah.

415
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,159
Neither did I.

416
00:32:43,284 --> 00:32:45,060
You know, I stand here,

417
00:32:45,185 --> 00:32:48,497
my wickedness washed away by
the... by the blood of the lamb.

418
00:32:48,622 --> 00:32:51,386
What the hell do you
know about wickedness?

419
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,847
You ever hear of bleeding Kansas?

420
00:33:03,169 --> 00:33:06,443
You know, I rode with
the martyr John Brown.

421
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,445
John Brown was a cold blooded killer.

422
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:11,448
You in a position to throw stones
on that account, Mr. Bohannon?

423
00:33:14,141 --> 00:33:15,368
That's right.

424
00:33:15,647 --> 00:33:19,226
Because you know one night...

425
00:33:19,351 --> 00:33:22,095
You authored the deaths of 5 men.

426
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,044
Slave owners.

427
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,255
We pulled them from their homes

428
00:33:27,421 --> 00:33:29,526
and butchered them with broadswords.

429
00:33:32,363 --> 00:33:34,406
You know, drunkard I was,

430
00:33:34,531 --> 00:33:38,510
I... I neglected to put
an edge on my blade.

431
00:33:38,635 --> 00:33:41,061
It was hard work, brother, but I...

432
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:45,852
I kept a hacking and a hacking...

433
00:33:45,977 --> 00:33:48,053
And a hacking till
I couldn't hack no more.

434
00:33:48,178 --> 00:33:52,280
Now, that's bleedin' Kansas.

435
00:33:53,649 --> 00:33:56,493
Why didn't you just shoot 'em?

436
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,397
Oh...

437
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:02,957
The mercy of a bullet was
something they didn't deserve.

438
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:06,036
Well, I owned slaves.

439
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:09,255
Yeah, well, lucky for you, you
weren't in Kansas that night.

440
00:34:09,421 --> 00:34:10,831
Ahh.

441
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:13,885
No, preacher.

442
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,307
It's lucky for you.

443
00:34:21,016 --> 00:34:24,220
No one deserves forgiveness, brother.

444
00:34:24,345 --> 00:34:26,731
That's the beauty of grace.

445
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:30,583
Yeah. Ah.

446
00:34:33,421 --> 00:34:38,500
Well, thank you
for the sermon, preacher.

447
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:40,245
I used to be a lot like you, Cullen.

448
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:44,165
The only difference
was I had a cause.

449
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:46,292
What is yours?

450
00:34:48,968 --> 00:34:52,146
Yeah, John Brown's dead.

451
00:34:52,271 --> 00:34:54,239
Ha ha.

452
00:34:55,374 --> 00:34:57,608
That's right.

453
00:34:59,378 --> 00:35:03,143
Yeah, I believe
we hung his sorry ass.

454
00:35:07,285 --> 00:35:11,735
Âª I wish I was
in the land of cotton ♪

455
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,600
♪ old times there
are not forgotten ♪

456
00:35:14,725 --> 00:35:18,742

457
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:19,909
Ha ha.

458
00:35:21,499 --> 00:35:23,809
Look away.

459
00:35:23,934 --> 00:35:26,469
Dixie Land.

460
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:00,617
Careful with this stuff, boys.

461
00:36:04,573 --> 00:36:06,007
Hey.

462
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,653
Ohh.

463
00:36:10,778 --> 00:36:12,796
You got a brick in your hat
this morning, boss man?

464
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:18,895
That hill we comin' up on
don't meet grade.

465
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,887
We either gotta blow it or go around.

466
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:23,765
Blow it.

467
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,017
My men ain't never
handled that black powder.

468
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:28,144
Uh, it ain't my problem.

469
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,855
You ain't no better than
Johnson, you know that?

470
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:34,042
How come every time I turn around

471
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:36,319
you're knee deep in my business?

472
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,822
Because you the boss.
I want to keep my job.

473
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,515
You better get to work then.

474
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,116
You got men ready to work

475
00:36:42,282 --> 00:36:44,035
and there ain't
no supplies or no foreman.

476
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:48,957
You got to get up off
your ass and get out there.

477
00:36:52,051 --> 00:36:54,462
The black powder is
on the damn supply train.

478
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,922
I ain't your master.

479
00:36:57,288 --> 00:36:59,425
You wanted freedom, you got it.

480
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:04,328
Figure it out your damn self.

481
00:37:05,463 --> 00:37:06,516
Ahh.

482
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,805
Ahh.

483
00:37:20,277 --> 00:37:23,366
Mick, where the hell you been?

484
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,724
Makin' us some money, Sean-O.

485
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:25,994
Right this way, lads.

486
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,956
You won't be disappointed, I promise.

487
00:37:45,868 --> 00:37:47,849
Hey, hey, hey.
No shoving.

488
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,180
One at a time.

489
00:37:49,305 --> 00:37:51,436
Everyone will get his turn now.

490
00:37:53,543 --> 00:37:54,647
Shh.

491
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:58,680
Right. Come on.

492
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:06,743
Go easy.

493
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:08,161
Are ya daft, Mick?

494
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,996
What?
It's brilliant.

495
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,080
It's a nickel a peep,

496
00:38:11,246 --> 00:38:12,369
the show's always changing,

497
00:38:12,494 --> 00:38:15,001
and there's no need for new slides.

498
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,170
You know, there's a lot
of uncontrollable factors.

499
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,422
Hey, hey!
This ain't no peep show.

500
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,577
Get out of here, you hobos
and you coal crunchers.

501
00:38:21,702 --> 00:38:23,217
You pay your $3.00
like everyone else!

502
00:38:23,383 --> 00:38:25,178
- Jeez.
- Get!

503
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,554
How's about a kiss for us instead.

504
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,681
Oh, how's about you
kiss my whore ass,

505
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,643
ya thick Irish bogtrotter!

506
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,878
Get!

507
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,467
Good morning.

508
00:39:06,027 --> 00:39:08,638
I trust you had
a decent night's sleep?

509
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,557
This is the first bed
I've slept in in a long time.

510
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:17,271
I'm sorry for my behavior last night.

511
00:39:17,437 --> 00:39:18,982
I'm afraid I had too much to drink.

512
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,899
Oh, please don't apologize.

513
00:39:21,024 --> 00:39:22,735
I enjoyed myself immensely.

514
00:39:22,901 --> 00:39:26,406
And today I was hoping to
see more of your railroad,

515
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:29,607
what you've accomplished,
what lies ahead.

516
00:39:29,732 --> 00:39:32,144
After all, your passion...

517
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:35,331
For this great enterprise
was an inspiration.

518
00:39:35,497 --> 00:39:40,253
Well, in that case, you shall
have the grand tour, my dear.

519
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,964
That is, if you're
well enough to ride?

520
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,049
I believe...

521
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,501
Let's go!

522
00:39:58,626 --> 00:40:01,395
Run, Bolan, run!

523
00:40:09,102 --> 00:40:10,379
Move, move, move!

524
00:40:10,504 --> 00:40:12,805
Run, bloody, run!

525
00:40:18,412 --> 00:40:19,959
Get out of there!

526
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,466
Oh, shit.

527
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,129
Shut the hell up.

528
00:40:28,254 --> 00:40:29,510
Uh!

529
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,555
They're gonna blow!

530
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:33,681
Oh, my leg!

531
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,729
Oh, my leg.

532
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,355
Quit your cryin', madam.

533
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:09,025
Get the hell out of there!

534
00:41:15,665 --> 00:41:18,309
Come on, lads, pull it up.

535
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:20,035
Pick it up.
Pick it up.

536
00:41:21,872 --> 00:41:23,581
Another bucket.
Another bucket.

537
00:41:40,856 --> 00:41:42,542
All right!

538
00:41:58,072 --> 00:42:00,768
Careful now.
Hold his head.

539
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,787
May I?

540
00:42:04,912 --> 00:42:07,150
Lift up the arm and put
pressure on the vein.

541
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,924
Right here?

542
00:42:09,049 --> 00:42:12,071
Little higher.
Right... there.

543
00:42:12,237 --> 00:42:14,329
You got it?

544
00:42:14,454 --> 00:42:15,908
I think so.

545
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,538
All right. I gotta go.
Stay with him.

546
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,507
All right! That's enough
lally gaggin' around.

547
00:42:31,673 --> 00:42:35,949
Rail crew better be hammerin' rail
by the time I get to my horse!

548
00:42:36,074 --> 00:42:38,686
Cut crew out to the cut!
Let's go!

549
00:42:38,811 --> 00:42:41,517
We got a hill to blow, boys!

550
00:42:41,683 --> 00:42:43,948
Back to work!

551
00:42:44,073 --> 00:42:47,982
