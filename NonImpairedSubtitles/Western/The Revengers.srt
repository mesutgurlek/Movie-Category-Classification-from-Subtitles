1
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,511
Capt. Benedict,
there's horses down there in the yard.

2
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,397
They're saddle horses.

3
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,596
Ain't Injun ponies, anyways.

4
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,793
Come over here.

5
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,390
Hello, my two little loves.

6
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,033
How are you?

7
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,792
Hey, Josh, Morgan?

8
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,194
You boys take care of this place
while I was gone?

9
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,508
Yes, sir, Pa.

10
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,672
Yesterday, Morgan shot a mountain lion
after the cows.

11
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,716
Did you get him?
Just hit him.

12
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,075
Waiting for you to get home
and I was gonna track him down.

13
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,151
We'll hunt him up in the morning.

14
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,753
Can I go, Pa, can I?

15
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,035
Now, look, you're rabbit size,
Morgan's cat size.

16
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,317
- Josh is rabbit size.
- Now, that's enough of that.

17
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,634
<i>Della.</i>

18
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,474
Now look at your mother.
Ever see a prettier mother anywhere?

19
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,596
Did you bring the things
I asked you for?

20
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,829
Everything you wanted.

21
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,639
The gold, the silver, the spices,
the silk, everything.

22
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,759
John Benedict, you know I mean
my new hairpins and shoes for Josh.

23
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,595
They might be mixed up
in the gold and the silver.

24
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,636
Now look, kids,
take care of the horses...

25
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,711
and be sure you bring
those saddlebags back...

26
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,360
we'll poke around,
probably find something for everyone.

27
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,670
Whit? I didn't expect company.

28
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,711
We rode out from town
this morning...

29
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,792
not knowing you'd gone up
to La Junta for a little horse trading.

30
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,475
Capt. Benedict, meet
Lt. Abel Lawson, Colorado State militia.

31
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,232
- Lieutenant.
- An honour, Capt. Benedict.

32
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,788
- I asked them to eat with us.
- Fine. Good.

33
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,189
- l'll call you when dinner's ready.
- All right.

34
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,430
Lieutenant, this is Free Hobson,
he works for me.

35
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,112
- Hi.
- Come on in.

36
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,795
Make yourselves comfortable,
l'll go and get washed up.

37
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,109
John, the Lieutenant and I are here
on a special sort of a visit.

38
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,389
Oh?

39
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,708
Yes, sir. l'd like to recruit
your son Morgan for West Point.

40
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,039
Well, that takes
a congressman's appointment.

41
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,750
I think the Sheriff can tell you...

42
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,798
that we didn't give that man in Denver
many votes last time.

43
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,154
But any man who holds a medal...

44
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,074
his son can go to West Point
without a congressman's appointment.

45
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,318
I don't think I want to use
the medal that way.

46
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,392
Capt. John Benedict,
if Morgan was my son...

47
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,389
l'd talk to him first
before I tried to be so danged noble.

48
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,478
- That's your opinion.
- You never asked me.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,514
May I discuss it
with your son, sir?

50
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,519
I think if there's anything
to be discussed, l'd better do it.

51
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,756
Dinner will be ready soon.

52
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,231
Stubborn. Always was.

53
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,629
Stubborner than a cavalry mule.

54
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,713
Now, where'd you get that, Free?
I went and got it out of your trunk.

55
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,789
What is it, Ma?

56
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,871
lt's the Congressional
Medal of Honour.

57
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,599
The President gave it to your pa.
lt's pretty.

58
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,511
Why don't we keep it
on the mantle?

59
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,036
I think your father prefers it
tucked away in the box.

60
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,157
What did you do, Pa?
Why, Capt. John Benedict...

61
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,836
I captured the entire Confederate Army
all by myself. Now isn't that enough?

62
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,716
There's something very interesting
about that piece of gold.

63
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,509
<i>The man who holds it,</i>
<i>his son can go to West Point Academy.</i>

64
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,109
Providing he can measure up
to the other requirements, too.

65
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,838
When would the Academy
be wanting a young fellow, Lieutenant?

66
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,069
Next month, sir.

67
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,469
First he'd have to go to Kansas
for his examinations.

68
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,393
<i>Then they'd put him on a steam train</i>
<i>to New York from there.</i>

69
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,119
Have to go right away, then?
Yes, sir.

70
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,999
Yesterday, Morgan shot
a mountain lion...

71
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,759
and l'd like to have him point out
where it happened.

72
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,637
If you'll excuse us.

73
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,830
Where did you first sight him, Morgan?

74
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,638
Way up on that south slope, Pa.

75
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,109
He was stalking a calf
that wandered off from its mother.

76
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,031
I got downwind of him.

77
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,752
- Long shot?
- About 300 yards.

78
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,114
But I hit him.

79
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,158
I figure he's got off into
one of the canyons to lick his wound.

80
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,753
We'll find him.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,798
- You'd like to go, wouldn't you, Son?
- Sir?

82
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,913
Well, you'd like to go to
West Point Academy, wouldn't you?

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,319
Yes, sir.

84
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,633
Man graduates from there,
he can be an architect or an engineer...

85
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,430
or almost anything he wants.

86
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,474
One of the finest schools there is.

87
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,713
I don't think it'd be right for me to leave
you and old Free to do all the work here.

88
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,189
You've been doing it all
ever since I can remember.

89
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,953
- Do you think we can't still do it?
- No.

90
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,071
You can do anything, Pa.

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,468
But I just don't think it's right.

92
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,913
As you say.

93
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,878
Lieutenant, l've had a discussion
with my son...

94
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,830
and I think the Academy needs
men like him. He can go.

95
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,874
Now, just a minute.
That is, if his mother approves.

96
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,157
I never thought l'd have
a son from way out here...

97
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,435
to go to West Point Academy.

98
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,952
l'm glad for you, Morgan.

99
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,837
l'll hunt up that cat in the morning.

100
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,833
You better help your mother
get yourself ready to go to Kansas.

101
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,391
Thank you, Lieutenant.

102
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,233
John.
Whit.

103
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,438
Stay.

104
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,114
Free! My God!

105
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,156
Indians and Comancheros.

106
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,474
Don't go in there, Captain,
for God's sake.

107
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,397
<i>God, don't do it. Hey, Captain?</i>

108
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,751
Morgan. He was shooting from the barn.

109
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,555
Morgan, Captain. Morgan!

110
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,073
Morgan?

111
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,308
Son?

112
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,478
We fought them, Captain.
Me and Morgan.

113
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,435
- We fought them.
- I know you did.

114
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,671
I can't swallow, Captain.

115
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,912
Had my gut shot.

116
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,188
Captain.

117
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,791
I remember something.

118
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,628
There was two white men with them.

119
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,271
What did you say, Free?

120
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,998
One man had a white eye.

121
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,798
He was the boss.

122
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,348
Captain?

123
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,598
I got to sleep.

124
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,395
John?

125
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,874
Della?

126
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,117
Whit, look over there.

127
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,278
You men stay here.

128
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,469
My God!

129
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,151
Good God almighty!

130
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,113
Buck Thomas' place got hit last night.

131
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,552
Buck's all right...

132
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,319
but the Indians ran off all his stock.

133
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,797
<i>We caught one of them.</i>

134
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,595
A white man. Comanchero.

135
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,072
I want to see him.

136
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,751
Get him down.
Take it easy...

137
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,354
I just don't want to look up at him.

138
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,230
The man that worked for me...

139
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,357
before he died said that
there were two of you.

140
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,635
The leader had one white eye.

141
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,792
What's his name?

142
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,431
Now those are your teeth.

143
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,431
Next your eyes.
No! Tarp!

144
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,556
His name's Tarp!
Tarp?

145
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,352
Where they going to trade the horses?

146
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,668
I don't know.

147
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,034
Mexico!

148
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,435
l'll need that horse he's riding.

149
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,988
l'm going to track that bunch.
l'll go and make a pack.

150
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,469
We're going to ride with you, John.

151
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,512
- John.
- Yeah?

152
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,869
Texas.

153
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,678
Well, the trail goes that way.

154
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,911
We're a long way from home
and the men are tired.

155
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,239
I want to thank all of you
for coming this far with me.

156
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,311
There's 1,000 miles out there
in any direction.

157
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,879
Those Comancheros
could be anywhere.

158
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,599
We've got nothing but time now,
and I got a feeling that...

159
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,717
that one-eyed Comanchero bastard
knows somebody's following him.

160
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,677
But you've got a ranch back in Colorado.

161
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,716
Whit, l'd appreciate it
if you'd board it up...

162
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,509
sell the cattle and the rest of the
livestock, and send me a bank order...

163
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,034
- at Fort Stockton.
- Anything you say.

164
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,474
A man can't even enjoy his lunch.

165
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,677
I speak good American, no?

166
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,751
Very good. <i>Muy bueno.</i>

167
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,279
Okay.

168
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,273
Tell me...

169
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,558
l'm looking for a place called
Pueblo Plata.

170
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,990
Pueblo Plata lies to the West.

171
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,152
It's a hiding place where outlaw
Kiowa, Comanches...

172
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,993
and Apache Indians
bring stolen horses...

173
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,548
and trade them for guns and tequila.

174
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,915
<i>I won't go there alone,</i> seòor.

175
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,794
Do you know any men
that would go with me?

176
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,916
In this place, no.

177
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,435
All these people are poor people
and they work in mines.

178
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,793
What about those prisoners
I saw in the wagon?

179
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,552
They're convict labourers.

180
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,029
They work up in the silver mines.

181
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,436
Where do they come from?

182
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,599
El Hoyo.

183
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,876
You would say, The Hole.

184
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,872
A prison 5 kilometres down to the south.

185
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,233
<i>Hablas inglés, seòor?</i>

186
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,198
A little, <i>seòor.</i>

187
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,549
l'd like to see your commandant.

188
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,349
I want to hire some men
to work in my mine.

189
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,158
I am the Commandant's interpreter.

190
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,639
My name's Benedict.

191
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,551
I want to see the Commandant.

192
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,598
You wish to buy slaves to work for you,
is correct?

193
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,797
No, l'd like to hire some men
to do a job.

194
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,439
What this job?

195
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,714
I have a mine. I can use six men.

196
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,395
But just one thing. I pick the men...

197
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,677
because l'm going to be working
alongside of them.

198
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,191
My name is
Rogelio Hernandez.

199
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,075
But in this Garden of Eden,
I am known as Cholo.

200
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,716
Well, Mr. Cholo, let's get going.

201
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,314
We will see the <i>Comandante. Vamos.</i>

202
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,079
The <i>Comandante</i> is a kind
and sympathetic person.

203
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,275
He shows us nothing but kindness...

204
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,399
and respect.

205
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,511
We would die for him.

206
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,475
Wait.

207
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,680
In fact, we do.
Three and four a day.

208
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,388
This warden is so corrupt,
that should the authorities know of him...

209
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,637
he would wear more chains
than all of us together.

210
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,716
In the name of the justice
of my country...

211
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,349
one day, he will stand against the wall
and be shot.

212
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,876
Well, I wish Godspeed to the justice
of your country.

213
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,594
- Tequila, <i>seòor?</i>
- No, <i>gracias.</i>

214
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,399
Now he will discuss the price
with you.

215
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,830
He's going to rob you, <i>seòor.</i>

216
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,593
I am instructed to tell you by this...

217
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,313
son of a drunken whore,
to tell you that it will cost you...

218
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,755
12 pesos a week for each labourer.

219
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,558
And 20 for the guards.

220
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,996
And in addition,
you have to pay this shit...

221
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,675
$100 for his cooperation.

222
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,876
l'll pay him if I can find the men I want.

223
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,631
<i>Seòor,</i> l'm trying to tell you
the usual price is 6 pesos per man...

224
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,598
and 10 for the guards,
and this drunken weasel...

225
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,638
will shine your boots
with his tongue for $10.

226
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,632
Just tell him l'll pay what he wants
if I can find what I want.

227
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,555
It's a deal.

228
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,919
Who is he?

229
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,673
His name is Job.
He was a slave in your country.

230
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,957
He escaped and he came into Mexico,
but people tried to trap him...

231
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,076
and return him for the reward.

232
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,436
He became the killer
of those who tried to trap him.

233
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,795
He was put in here, and here he will die.

234
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,074
Mark him.

235
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,151
But, <i>seòor,</i>
he's not going to work for you.

236
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,559
Mark him!

237
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,560
His name is Quiberon.
He is French.

238
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,596
A deserter from
the army of Maximilian and a <i>bandido.</i>

239
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,516
<i>Every day he tries to climb the wall</i>
<i>of this prison.</i>

240
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,512
<i>It is impossible.</i>

241
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,313
<i>Yet he tries.</i>

242
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,119
Quiberon?

243
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,033
Do you think
you will make it to the top?

244
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,838
Crap on you, Cholo!

245
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,871
One day l'll make it.

246
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,433
l'll take him.

247
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,554
He is kept on the chain
because his is an animal and he fights.

248
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,278
He fights anyone.

249
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,278
Yet when he works in the mines
he's peaceful...

250
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,470
and he works like a beast.

251
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,272
<i>His name is Zweig.</i>

252
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,711
He is <i>alemán.</i> German.

253
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,078
Excuse me.

254
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,194
Mister...

255
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,072
you look like a fellow countryman.
You sure do.

256
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,672
If you're making up a labour gang,
l'd be mighty beholden to get on it.

257
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,192
Why, l'd work my hard old ass
clean down to the bone...

258
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,475
if I could just get out
of this hole for a time.

259
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,755
<i>Seòor</i> Benedict.
You ask anybody...

260
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,469
old Bill Hoop is a true master
when it comes to the pick and shovel.

261
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,391
Hot dang, I tell you...

262
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,274
a gopher can't hold a candle to me
when it comes to digging.

263
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,591
What are you here for?

264
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,917
Why, they claim that I was rustling
cattle up around Paso del Norte way...

265
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,710
and they had to blame somebody...

266
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,870
and I swear,
I never even been arrested before.

267
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,313
<i>I swear it.</i>

268
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,510
l'm just a true-blue, honest American.

269
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,230
You wouldn't let
a fellow American die...

270
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,595
in a place like this, now, would you, sir?

271
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,876
Excuse me, <i>seòor.</i> Please.

272
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,120
In the two months
he has been here, we all know him.

273
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,031
Me? You goddamn greaser!

274
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,588
He is a <i>bandido,</i> a rapist,
a murderer, a thief!

275
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,954
l'm going to get you for this.

276
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,349
l'll unravel your guts out
like a ball of yarn.

277
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,919
Pueblo Plata.

278
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,073
- What?
- Have you been to Pueblo Plata?

279
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,634
Maybe.

280
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,757
Well, 'maybe' doesn't buy
your way out of here.

281
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,639
Pueblo Plata?

282
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,877
I think I can find it.

283
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,036
- l'll take this man.
- I knowed it.

284
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,998
l've knowed you was the kind of
American that would stand up...

285
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,197
for the Stars and Stripes
no matter where us Americans is.

286
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,713
I salute you.

287
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,270
l'll also take the German.
No, <i>seòor.</i>

288
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,273
You said he was strong and he worked
hard. Now, I need two more men.

289
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,871
What about you, Cholo?

290
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,237
No, I wouldn't be any good as a <i>peón.</i>

291
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,035
l'm a scholar, a philosopher...

292
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,035
and a man filled with integrity.

293
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,351
I can tell you what he's filled with,
and it ain't that!

294
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,274
You want to get out of here?
Well...

295
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,835
- I think I work for you, <i>seòor.</i>
- All right, one more man.

296
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,314
Wait.

297
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,951
Come on, which one is it?

298
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,400
Against the wall.
Against the wall?

299
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,115
He's called El Chamaco.
The Kid.

300
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,519
He's a paid assassin.

301
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,239
He killed his first man
when he was 14 years old.

302
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,515
How many since then? <i>Quién sabe?</i>

303
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,559
<i>This</i> hombre <i>is getting men for his mine.</i>

304
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,838
You won't have to wear
chains on your legs.

305
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,873
<i>Sí,</i> a good mine, Chamaco.

306
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,955
You come with us,
and I think you won't regret it.

307
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,911
l'll take the lead, you follow me.

308
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,389
- <i>Sí, seòor.</i>
- Everyone on the wagon.

309
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,632
They can't make me work
for nobody.

310
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,597
I told them I wouldn't work.

311
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,672
You better shut up or he's going to blow
your black head off!

312
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,231
<i>Chamaco, you see that greased holster</i>
<i>that Mr. Benedict hangs that.45 in?</i>

313
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,239
l'll bet you
that Mr. Benedict can sling that.45...

314
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,515
faster than a whore's ass on payday.

315
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,468
My teeth ache clean down to my ass.

316
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,396
I wonder when Mr. Benedict's
going to stop this wagon.

317
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,754
Look at him...

318
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,796
eating hot beans with them
damned greasers...

319
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,393
and me, his fellow American...

320
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,950
trying to get some juice
out of this dried jackrabbit.

321
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,554
Cholo.

322
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,108
Tell them to put their guns
down on the ground.

323
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,836
There's a length of rope here,
tie them up.

324
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,195
Just Cholo.
The rest of you stay where you are.

325
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,793
Go on, get back.

326
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,317
Not too tight.
So they can get loose after a while.

327
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,476
l'm going to Pueblo Plata
to kill a man named Tarp.

328
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,798
<i>He's got a bunch of renegade Indians</i>
<i>and probably some Comancheros.</i>

329
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,791
<i>I'd do it myself,</i>
<i>but the odds are a little steep.</i>

330
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,714
We can cross the Rio Grande
and be into the States by morning.

331
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,679
<i>I'll buy you clothes, guns, and horses.</i>

332
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,075
We'll cross back into Mexico
about 100 miles to the west.

333
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,990
I can't make you go with me...

334
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,438
- but l'll take your word that you will.
- Hey.

335
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,990
There is no banks to be robbed?
No gold to be stolen?

336
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,195
Is that all you want with us?

337
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,516
To help you kill a man?

338
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,273
Now, what the hell do you care
what he wants?

339
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,033
You come to the right man,
Mr. Benedict, yes, sir.

340
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,157
You can count on old William P. Hoop.
Yes, sir.

341
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,075
Then I have your word, Mr. Hoop?

342
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,990
I hope to shake a rag
you got my word, Mr. Benedict.

343
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,318
Why, I wouldn't let
no fellow American down.

344
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,670
l'll take your word, Mr. Hoop.

345
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,359
Mr. Zweig?

346
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,394
- Can I have your word?
- Sure.

347
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,832
I give you my word.

348
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,436
This is a joke, I think.

349
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,870
No joke to me, Mr. Quiberon.

350
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,872
Well, if you think my word
is worth something...

351
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,030
yes, I give you my word.

352
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,988
It's worth what you make it worth.

353
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,552
What about you, Job?

354
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,071
You won't take my chains off.

355
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,515
Won't nobody take my chains off.

356
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,513
What if I do?

357
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,553
l'll have to think about that some more.

358
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,789
Cholo?

359
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,670
You can trust me as much as
you can trust these, <i>seòor.</i>

360
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,229
Now what the hell kind of word is that?

361
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,719
I trust him.

362
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,918
Then I am your man.

363
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,154
Chamaco?

364
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,190
Why you want to kill this man?

365
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,836
My family was massacred by this man
and his Comanches.

366
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,513
You got my word.

367
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,558
Cholo, get this gear together.
Rest of you, get on the wagon.

368
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,393
- Mr. Zweig, you take the reins.
- Okay, sir.

369
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,391
Him, drive? Why he...
Mr. Hoop.

370
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,754
Yes, sir.

371
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,991
Leave the guns.
Yes, sir.

372
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,593
I don't know.

373
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,716
I won't say something
I might not mean...

374
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,916
I still got to think some more.

375
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,399
You do that.

376
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,275
Hot dang, l'll tell you,
we're in my country now, men!

377
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,794
Yes, sir!

378
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,753
Hi, fellow Americans,
how you doing?

379
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,028
Wait for me, ladies!
I come back in a little while.

380
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,475
Wait for me, ladies!

381
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,797
Everybody in here.

382
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,751
Man, I seen purple shirts,
but never like that.

383
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,348
I tell you, l'm beginning to feel
like a genuine human being.

384
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,193
Don't make the mistake
of thinking you are one.

385
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,239
Get off my neck,
you high-toned greaser.

386
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,914
You call me greaser once more,
I kill you!

387
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,037
You see this? It isn't an umbrella, bub.

388
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,756
Don't start talking about killing unless
you want your head blown clean off.

389
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,873
Camp over here.

390
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,230
I don't think
we're going to camp here, Mr. Benedict.

391
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,069
You don't seem surprised, <i>seòor.</i>

392
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,634
No.

393
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,035
I took a long chance on all of you.

394
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,953
You're the galldangdest fool I ever seen.

395
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,676
'Give me your word,' he says.

396
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,991
Well, how do you like the word
we're giving you now, Mr. Benedict?

397
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,513
Mr. Benedict...

398
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,319
you have appealed
to the honour of men...

399
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,118
who have no honour.

400
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,078
Even you, Cholo?

401
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,159
I have no time for this thing
you want to do, <i>seòor.</i>

402
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,629
Why we talk? Let's get the money.

403
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,516
You get the money, Mr. Quiberon.
It's in my saddlebag.

404
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,790
Don't touch your gun,
mister.

405
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,879
If I do, l'll take you first, Chamaco.

406
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,388
Try it.

407
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,438
Hot dang, I told you about
that greased holster.

408
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,798
I don't think maybe you could kill
all of us, Mr. Benedict.

409
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,354
No, but I could drop three of you.

410
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,118
But then I wouldn't get
to Pueblo Plata.

411
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,714
So I suggest that you just take
the money and we'll part company.

412
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,911
Go ahead, Mr. Quiberon.

413
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,069
Them horses of his would bring
$100 extra or so.

414
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,714
Now, that's another thing, Mr. Hoop.

415
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,436
Without my horses,
I can't get to where l'm going...

416
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,153
so we'd better just shoot it out
right now.

417
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,239
Maybe this'll make it
a little more even for you, Mr. Benedict.

418
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,719
Well, now...

419
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,673
what the hell are you doing?
You're with us.

420
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,268
I ain't one of nobody but myself...

421
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,032
and myself says...

422
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,230
this man keeps his horses.

423
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,312
It's all right.

424
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,150
I ain't starting no shoot-out.

425
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,754
Hell, you can keep your damn horses.

426
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,631
<i>Adiós, seòor</i> Benedict.

427
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,151
l'll give you my word now.

428
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,437
But I don't know why.
l'll think about it later.

429
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,429
I don't owe you nothing, mister.

430
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,955
I could have worn them chains
all my life...

431
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,110
and I wouldn't have give a damn.

432
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,998
It was when they sold me
to the breeding farm for slaves...

433
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,878
that's when I said to myself
I was a man.

434
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,318
They used to whip me but they couldn't
make me hump none of them gals.

435
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:53,636
I sure picked the wrong time to decide
I wasn't going to be a slave no more.

436
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,993
You know...

437
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,755
two of us can't do any more good
at Pueblo Plata than one.

438
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,590
You can make tracks any time.

439
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,638
Ain't just going to be the two of us,
and you know it.

440
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,598
<i>You're counting on</i>
<i>some of them coming back.</i>

441
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,713
I admit I had some such idea,
but it looked like I gambled wrong.

442
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,509
I shared a lot of misery with them men
and I know them, too.

443
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,636
Zweig's more sad than bad.

444
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,714
And the Frenchman, he loves a fight.

445
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,798
Cholo? He's a sidewinder.

446
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,715
Hoop, he ain't coming back
because he ain't worth spit.

447
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,678
What about Chamaco?

448
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,633
He's liable to come back just to kill you.

449
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,029
In that case, Job, we stay here.

450
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,797
He's just dead drunk.

451
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,949
I know. I can smell him from here.

452
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,953
l'll come back.

453
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,476
Step down, Chamaco,
we'll have some grub in a while.

454
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,591
I don't want your food.

455
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,151
Well, your horse may.

456
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,158
There's some grain in the pack
over there.

457
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,953
Looks like you had
a good time last night.

458
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,958
I got no money left.

459
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,510
I give all my share of your money
to a beautiful lady.

460
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,878
I can make out.
I still had $300 in my boots.

461
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,794
Mr. Benedict, this is not honest.

462
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,835
That's an interesting way
of looking at it, Mr. Quiberon.

463
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,158
I hear horses.

464
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,877
Wake the others.

465
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,279
Job.

466
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,280
You three get behind the bank there.

467
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,754
- Why you pick me to come with you?
- Listen.

468
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,475
That direction. You stay here.

469
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,113
<i>Seòor</i> Benedict.

470
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,878
If you are there, hold your fire.

471
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,633
It is I, Cholo.

472
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,829
It's me, too, Mr. Benedict.

473
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,351
<i>But hot damn, don't shoot now.</i>

474
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,716
I dragged this <i>cabrón</i> along
because he might be useful.

475
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,360
Bullshit. I come back
on my own free will.

476
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,510
I can see that. Cholo, untie him.

477
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,034
Zweig, take the horses.
Okay, sir.

478
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,754
And then we'll have a council of war...

479
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,520
and Mr. Hoop's going to tell us
what we want to know...

480
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,318
about Pueblo Plata.

481
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,511
Pueblo Plata?
Come on now.

482
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,670
I don't know
what you're talking about.

483
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,512
Pueblo... Wait a minute, fellows.

484
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,034
God damn it!
Come on, come over here.

485
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,837
Damn it, let go of me.

486
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,039
Now look, I ain't gonna take you
to no Pueblo Plata.

487
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,997
If you don't take us...

488
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,638
you don't go anywhere.

489
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,755
All right.

490
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,236
Now look what you went
and done. You drawn blood.

491
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,955
We're going to play mumbly-peg
with your head, Comanchero!

492
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,073
No!

493
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,037
All right, l'll bring you to Pueblo Plata...

494
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,913
but it won't do no good.

495
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,156
If you think you're going to fool them,
you got worms in your head.

496
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,629
Traders, guns and whiskey.

497
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,714
If the Comancheros want to look
at them empty packs...

498
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,631
before we get to Plata...

499
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,757
it's going to be a Merry Christmas
in Hell, l'll tell you.

500
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,876
A Merry Christmas in Hell.

501
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,635
Have you been down to Mexico much?

502
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,236
Some when I was younger.

503
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,913
When was that?

504
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,358
I was on a border survey
about 20 years ago.

505
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,032
You ever got to a place
called Villa Acuòa?

506
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,679
Might have.

507
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,115
You remember, wouldn't you?
lt's right on the border.

508
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,159
I don't remember. Why do you ask?

509
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,871
I used to live there once.

510
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,999
That's all.

511
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,191
How many in your family?

512
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,072
- Five.
- How many women?

513
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,991
My wife, two daughters.

514
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,512
You had two sons?

515
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,709
- That's right.
- How old your sons?

516
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,478
One was just a youngster,
the other was 18.

517
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,519
You know, l'm not much older than him.

518
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,558
He looked like you?

519
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,796
No, looked like his mother.

520
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,316
I look like my mother...

521
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,836
except she got black eyes, I got blue.

522
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,391
She's dead, my mother.

523
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,949
Well, I hope she died peacefully.

524
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,591
Her name was Secundina.

525
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,952
Now look, Mr. Benedict, we're
going to get our asses blown clean off.

526
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,953
I tell you,
they're watching us right now.

527
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,837
I hope so, Mr. Hoop.

528
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,113
But don't you understand?
That fellow Tarp will kill us.

529
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,792
All stone dead!

530
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,150
We have company,
Mr. Benedict.

531
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,950
That's right, Mr. Quiberon.

532
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,835
Gentlemen, raise your rifles
over your head...

533
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,115
and get a smile on your face.

534
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,712
You, too, Mr. Hoop.

535
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,992
Now talk to him.

536
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,228
He wants to know what we want here.

537
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,030
Tell him I got a present for him.

538
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,119
Easy now.

539
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,154
That son of a bitch's name is Katwa.

540
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,953
I seen him gut children just for sport.

541
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,233
Now he wants you to open up
them packages...

542
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,952
and see what's inside.

543
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:59,157
Tell him we're going to deal
with the white man.

544
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,312
Go on, tell him!

545
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,195
Tarp, there's a party coming in.

546
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,119
Wake up, Tarp.

547
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,949
Tarp!

548
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,314
How many? How far?
I can't tell yet!

549
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,233
Damn Indians!

550
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,953
They know better than to bring
somebody up here.

551
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,953
Rally must have known them
or they wouldn't be bringing them in.

552
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,473
Bullshit.

553
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,028
You go down and you talk
to those people. You stop them.

554
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,315
And you stall them!
All right.

555
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,079
<i>Indios!</i>

556
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,997
Bill, take the point!
