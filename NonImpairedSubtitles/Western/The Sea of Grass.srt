WOULDN'T YOU THINK
THEY'D GET TIRED

10
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:07,627
OF LOOKING AT THEMSELVES?

11
00:02:07,662 --> 00:02:08,628
WEDDINGS!

12
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:10,630
I'LL BE SO GLAD WHEN IT'S OVER.

13
00:02:10,665 --> 00:02:11,631
HURRY UP, RACHAEL.

14
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,633
WHAT FOR?
IT AIN'T TILL 3 DAYS.

15
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:15,635
RACHAEL, HAVE YOU
EVER BEEN MARRIED?

16
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,637
YES'EM-HERE AND THERE
NOW AND THEN.

17
00:02:19,174 --> 00:02:20,640
WHERE'S LUTIE?

18
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:22,642
SHE'S IN THERE.
SHE'S TRYING IT ON.

19
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,145
MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN YOU
CAN IMAGINE!

20
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,149
MAY I SEE YOU,
LUTIE?

21
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,651
ONE MINUTE, FATHER!
LET HIM IN, RACHAEL.

22
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,157
YOU LOOK FINE.

23
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:38,658
THEN SMILE!
- SMILE?

24
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:40,660
YOU HAVEN'T SMILED
ONCE SINCE I GOT ENGAGED.

25
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:41,661
WHY, LUTIE, I...

26
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:43,663
THE TWO LONGEST THINGS
IN ST. LOUIS-

27
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:45,165
YOUR FACE AND THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER.

28
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,666
WELL, I ONLY WANT
YOUR HAPPINESS, LUTIE.

29
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,668
AND I JUST KEEP THINKING
ONE THING:

30
00:02:48,703 --> 00:02:49,560
JIM BREWTON IS ALL RIGHT.

31
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:51,171
HE'S GREAT IN SALT FORK
TERRITORY OF NEW MEXICO

32
00:02:51,206 --> 00:02:52,672
AND YOU'RE ALL RIGHT
IN ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI.

33
00:02:52,707 --> 00:02:54,174
STOP IT, DARLING.

34
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,951
AND THEN I THINK OF
THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER,

35
00:02:55,952 --> 00:02:56,676
AND NEITHER PLACE-

36
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:57,677
I KNOW IT'S GOING
TO BE RIGHT.

37
00:02:57,712 --> 00:02:59,396
AND, LUTIE, SUCH A
A SHORT COURTSHIP.

38
00:02:59,397 --> 00:03:00,180
A COWMAN!

39
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:01,681
BUT SUCH A COWMAN.

40
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:04,184
REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID
WHEN YOU INTRODUCED US.

41
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:05,685
THAT'S RIGHT,
I DID INTRODUCE YOU.

42
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,187
HERE'S A TELEGRAM
FOR YOU.

43
00:03:07,222 --> 00:03:08,688
OH, THANKS.
IT'S PROBABLY FROM HIM.

44
00:03:08,723 --> 00:03:10,690
HE MUST HAVE LEFT.
HE SAID HE'D WIRE

45
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:12,192
THE MINUTE HE GOT
ON THE TRAIN.

46
00:03:12,227 --> 00:03:14,694
DELAYED. CAN'T-

47
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:16,696
GET TO ST. LOUIS FCR WEDDING.

48
00:03:16,731 --> 00:03:17,671
TAKE FIRST TRAIN

49
00:03:17,672 --> 00:03:19,199
BE MARRIED HERE. LOVE, JIM.

50
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:20,200
WELL!

51
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:22,702
FATHER, THIS IS NOT FUNNY.

52
00:03:22,737 --> 00:03:24,704
WELL, YOU ASKED ME
TO SMILE, DIDN'T YOU?

53
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,591
YOU DONE IT-

54
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:35,715
TRAIN'S EARLY, 3/4 OF AN HOUR!

55
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,218
AND 33 SECONDS.
I GOT A STOPWATCH.

56
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:01,241
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
IF SAM DOESN'T MEET YOU?

57
00:04:01,276 --> 00:04:02,963
DON'T WORRY.
YOU HEARD THE CONDUCTOR-

58
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:03,743
TRAIN'S EARLY.

59
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:05,745
YOUR MAN AIN'T
SHOWED UP, NEITHER.

60
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,247
SAMMY!

61
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,252
SAMMY!

62
00:04:13,288 --> 00:04:15,755
HELLO, SPROUT.

64
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:19,259

00:04:22,797 --> 00:04:24,264

00:04:34,309 --> 00:04:37,777

00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,295
BE A GOOD GIRL,
BUTTON-NOSE.

82
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,306

00:05:10,345 --> 00:05:12,812
COLONE BREWTON WILL

86
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:14,314

87
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,381

00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,397
I'LL BE A SON OF A GUN.

91
00:06:37,432 --> 00:06:38,398
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

92
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:40,400
I SAID,
I'M A SON OF A GUN.

93
00:06:40,435 --> 00:06:42,436
IT ISN'T POSSIBLE. OF COURSE NOW,
IS IT? - WHAT?

94
00:06:42,437 --> 00:06:43,903
THAT YOU ARE MISS LUTIE CAMERON

95
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:45,405
OF ST. LOUIS AND POINTS EAST.

96
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,906
SHE ARRIVES ON THE 3:00.

97
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:48,408
THEY'RE SENDING UP
ROCKETS THEN.

98
00:06:48,443 --> 00:06:49,409
THE TRAIN WAS EARLY.

99
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,911
TRUST JIM BREWTON
TO PICK A WOMAN

100
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:53,913
WITH HAIR THE COLOR
OF CHILI PEPPER.

101
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,915
WELL, DON'T WORRY,
I LIKE IT.

102
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,418
WELL, IF YOU KNOW COLONEL
BREWTON, YOU CAN HELP ME.

103
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,421
EVERYBODY KNOWS JIM BREWTON,
SOME TO THEIR SORROW.

104
00:07:01,456 --> 00:07:03,923
YOUR IMPENDING ARRIVAL
HAS CREATED QUITE A STIR

105
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,425
IN SALT FORK,
MISS CAMERON.

106
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,427
BREATHS HAVE BEEN
WELL-BATED.

107
00:07:07,462 --> 00:07:09,429
I SHALL NOW BATE MINE AGAIN.

108
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,932
YOU'RE MAKING THE MISTAKE
OF YOUR LIFE, YOU KNOW.

109
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:14,934
THERE'S A TRAIN OUT
OF HERE TOMORROW.

110
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:16,430
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D BE ON IT.

111
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:17,437
WHO ARE YOU, ANYWAY?

112
00:07:17,472 --> 00:07:18,938
THE NAME'S BRICE CHAMBERLAIN.

113
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:21,441
HOWEVER, "WHAT," NOT "WHO,"
IS THE IMPORTANT THING.

114
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:23,943
I, MISS CAMERON,
AM AN IDEALIST-

115
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:26,446
A PRACTICING IDEALIST.

116
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:27,947
LOOK AROUND YOU,
MISS CAMERON.

117
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:29,449
YOU'RE OUT OF PLACE.

118
00:07:29,484 --> 00:07:33,453
THE WINE OF THE COW COUNTRY
IS REDEYE, NOT CHAMPAGNE.

119
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:34,954
REDEYE...
- REDEYE.

120
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,457
A VERY INFERIOR
BRAND OF WHISKEY.

121
00:07:37,492 --> 00:07:38,958
NEVER TOUCH
THE STUFF MYSELF.

122
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:40,960
UNDERSTAND BREWTON
DOES, THOUGH.

123
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:43,963
I SHOULD BE VERY ANGRY.
I GUESS I AM.

124
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:46,127
ON THE OTHER HAND, MAYBE I'M NOT.

125
00:07:46,128 --> 00:07:46,966
I DON'T KNOW.

126
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:48,468
THIS IS SUCH
A PLACE.

127
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,971
COME ON, MR. CHAMBERLAIN,
JURY'S COMING IN.

128
00:07:52,006 --> 00:07:53,406
WE BETTER GET OVER THERE.

129
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:54,974
BREWTON AIN'T SHOWED UP YET.

130
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,976
SURE, ANDY. MEET YOU
AT THE COURTHOUSE.

131
00:07:57,011 --> 00:07:58,978
IS THAT WHERE COLONEL BREWTON IS,
AT THE COURTHOUSE?

132
00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:00,480
THAT'S WHERE I LEFT HIM.

133
00:08:00,515 --> 00:08:02,982
WHY, YOU'RE HIS ENEMY,
AREN'T YOU?

134
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:04,484
HIS NATURAL ENEMY.

135
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:07,487
WE'RE MAKING HISTORY IN SALT FORK
TODAY, MISS CAMERON.

136
00:08:07,522 --> 00:08:09,989
I HOPE IT WILL BE
THE RIGHT KIND.

137
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,992
IF BREWTON HAS HIS WAY
IT WON'T BE.

138
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:22,001
QUIET DOWN, FOLKS,
QUIET DOWN!

139
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:25,505
QUIET IN THE COURTHOUSE, BOYS.
THE COURT'S IN SESSION NOW.

140
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,021
GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY

141
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:43,523
HAV E YOU REACHED A DECISION?

142
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:46,526
YES, SIR, WE HAVE-
UNANIMOUS.

143
00:08:46,561 --> 00:08:47,527
HOW FIND YOU?

144
00:08:47,562 --> 00:08:50,029
ARE THE DEFENDANTS GUILTY
OR NOT GUILTY?

145
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:52,031
WE FIND THAT
ANDY BOGGS HERE

146
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:54,534
WAS SHOT AND RUN OFF
THE LAND HE FILED ON

147
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,536
BY PARTIES UNKNOWN.

148
00:08:56,571 --> 00:08:58,037
WELL, THAT VERDICT
DON'T SETTLE ANYTHING.

149
00:08:58,072 --> 00:08:59,539
HOW ABOUT
THE DEFENDANTS HERE-

150
00:08:59,574 --> 00:09:01,040
IKE RANDALL
AND BILL ROACH?

151
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,364
YOU MEAN, THE BOYS
WHAT DONE THE SHOOTIN'?

152
00:09:03,365 --> 00:09:04,143
THEY AIN'T GUILTY.

153
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,557
DEFENDANTS RELEASED.
COURT'S ADJOURNED!

154
00:09:17,592 --> 00:09:19,559
JUST ONE MOMENT,
GENTLEMEN!

155
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,063
THIS TRIAL'S OVER, BUT AS
ATTORNEY FOR THE PLAINTIFFS,

156
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,066
THERE ARE STILL A FEW
THINGS STICKING IN MY CRAW.

157
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:29,068
SWALLOW QUICK,
AND MAYBE THEY'LL GO AWAY.

158
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,571
COLONEL BREWTON, I WONDER,
NOW THAT WE'VE LOST

159
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:34,073
IF YOU'D OBLIGE ME
BY ANSWERING A FEW QUESTIONS.

160
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:36,075
LET'S SAY, AS A SPORTING
PROPOSITION.

161
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,577
TROUBLE WITH YOU IS,
YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU'RE LICKED.

162
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,580
NO, HE DOESN'T, MAC.
WE'LL HAVE TO GIVE HIM THAT.

163
00:09:40,615 --> 00:09:42,081
ALL RIGHT, SIR
GO AHEAD.

164
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,584
JUST REMEMBER, I'VE GOT A
3 O'CLOCK TRAIN TO MEET.

165
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,587
THANK YOU,
I'LL BE BRIEF.

166
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:48,381
COLONEL BREWTON,

167
00:09:48,382 --> 00:09:50,089
HOW MUCH CATTLE RANGE DO YOU CONTROL?

168
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:52,592
I'VE HEARD IT RUNS
INTO A MILLION OR MORE ACRES.

169
00:09:52,627 --> 00:09:53,593
I'VE NEVER COUNTED THEM.

170
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,596
THEN AGAIN, I'VE HEARD
THAT IT'S 100 SQUARE MILES.

171
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:57,967
IN ANY CASE YOU WILL ADMIT

172
00:09:57,968 --> 00:09:59,599
THAT'S A LOT OF LAND FOR ONE MAN.

173
00:09:59,634 --> 00:10:02,101
WELL, I RUN A LOT OF COWS.

174
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:04,604
IS IT TRUE THAT OF THIS
VAST AMOUNT OF PROPERTY

175
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,606
YOU ACTUALLY OWN ONLY
A FEW SCATTERED WATER HOLES

176
00:10:06,641 --> 00:10:07,526
THAT ARE FILED ON

177
00:10:07,527 --> 00:10:09,609
EITHER IN YOUR NAME
OR THOSE OF YOUR MEN?

178
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,611
AND THAT BY FAR
THE GREATER PART OF IT

179
00:10:11,646 --> 00:10:13,112
STILL BELONGS
TO THE GOVERNMENT.

180
00:10:13,147 --> 00:10:14,614
LEGALLY, YES.

181
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,117
IS IT TRUE, THEN THAT
MILLION OR MORE ACRES

182
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:19,619
STILL BELONGING
TO THE GOVERNMENT,

183
00:10:19,654 --> 00:10:22,121
IS THE SAME LAND FROM
WHICH ANDREW BOGGS

184
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:26,125
WHO MERELY WANTED 160 ACRES
FOR A HOMESTEAD.

185
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,628
WAS RUN OFF AND
SEVERELY WOUNDED

186
00:10:28,663 --> 00:10:30,630
BY PARTIES UNKNOWN.

187
00:10:30,665 --> 00:10:32,131
BOGGS WAS NOT
RUN OFF BECAUSE

188
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,133
HE WANTED TO SETTLE
THE 160 ACRES

189
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:36,636
BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT
HE WANTED TO DO WITH THE LAND.

190
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,137
LET'S FORGET
ABOUT THIS CASE.

191
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,640
ANDREW BOGGS IS ONLY
A SINGLE MAN,

192
00:10:40,675 --> 00:10:43,142
AND THE COURT HAS
ALREADY DISPOSED OF HIM.

193
00:10:43,177 --> 00:10:45,645
BUT WAITING AT
THE EDGE OF SALT FORK

194
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,147
TO HEAR THE OUTCOME OF THIS TRIAL
ARE OTHER SETTLERS.

195
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,650
MEN WITH FAMILIES,

196
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:52,652
WHO'VE DRIVEN THEIR WAGONS
MORE THAN 1,000 MILES

197
00:10:52,687 --> 00:10:55,154
ACROSS THE PLAINS
AND LEFT THEIR DEAD

198
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:57,156
FROM THE MISSISSIPPI
TO THE RIO GRANDE

199
00:10:57,191 --> 00:10:59,659
ALL WITH ONE PURPOSE-
TO FIND HOMES

200
00:10:59,694 --> 00:11:01,661
FOR THEMSELVES IN THIS GREAT TERRITORY.

201
00:11:01,696 --> 00:11:04,664
I WANT TO ASK IN THE NAMES
OF THESE FAMILIES

202
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:08,167
IF YOU WON'T LET THEM SETTLE
UNDISTURBED ON A FEW ACRES

203
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,171
OUT OF THE MILLIONS OR MORE
OF GOVERNMENT LAND ON YOUR RANGE.

204
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,178
CHAMBERLAIN, I HAVE SYMPATHY
FOR THE EARLY PIONEER

205
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:21,180
WHO CAME OUT HERE
AND RISKED HIS LIFE

206
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,182
AND HIS FAMILY'S
AMONG THE INDIANS,

207
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,686
AND I HOPE I HAVE A LITTLE CHARITY
FOR THE NESTOR

208
00:11:26,721 --> 00:11:29,188
WHO WAITED UNTIL THE COUNTRY
WAS SAFE AND PEACEABLE

209
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:31,190
BEFORE HE FILED HIS HOMESTEAD
ON THE RANGE

210
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:34,193
OF SOMEONE ELSE WHO
HAD FOUGHT FOR IT.

211
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:37,196
BUT WHEN THAT NESTOR PICKS
LAND LIKE MY BIG VEGA,

212
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:39,198
WHICH IS 7000 FEET ABOVE THE SEA

213
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:41,200
WHICH WAS NATURALLY
INTENDED FOR

214
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:42,702
GRAZING LAND, AND ALWAYS WILL
BE GRAZING LAND,

215
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,705
WHEN HE WANT TO PLOW IT UP
TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY

216
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,207
WHERE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH RAIN
FOR THE CROPS TO GROW,

217
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:50,710
WHEN HE ONLY KILLS
THE GRASS THAT WILL GROW,

218
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,212
AND THEN, WHEN HIS CROPS
STARVE FOR WATER,

219
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:55,214
SUPPORTS HIS FAMILY
BY KILLING MY BEEF,

220
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,717
AND BECOMES A MAN WITHOUT
RESPECT TO HIMSELF

221
00:11:57,752 --> 00:11:59,719
AND A MENACE
TO THE TERRITORY,

222
00:11:59,754 --> 00:12:01,220
THEN I HAVE NEITHER SYMPATHY
NOR CHARITY.

223
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,729
AND IF I KNOW THE TEMPER
OF THE PEOPLE AROUND HERE

224
00:12:09,764 --> 00:12:11,731
WHAT ANDY BOGGS GOT
IS JUST A SAMPLE OF

225
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:13,733
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF OTHERS
TRY IT.

226
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,240
THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS
NO JUSTICE HERE

227
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,243
AND THAT YOU DOMINATED
THE COUNTRY.

228
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:25,244
THEY WERE RIGHT.

229
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,760
WELL, WE WON, JIM.

230
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,262
BOYS, I'VE GOT A TRAIN TO MEET.

231
00:12:43,297 --> 00:12:45,264
JIM! JIM!

232
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:46,766
JIM!

233
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,774
PARDON, PARDON.

234
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:59,278
JIM, THE TRAIN
BROKE A RECORD.

235
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,782
I'LL MAKE UP FOR THAT LATER.

236
00:13:02,817 --> 00:13:06,786
OH, I WANT YOU TO MEET A FRIEND
OF MINE, DOC REID.

237
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:08,287
HOW DO YOU DO?
- THIS IS JUDGE WHITE.

238
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:09,789
HOW DO YOU DO?
- HOW DO YOU DO?

239
00:13:09,824 --> 00:13:10,790
FLOYD McCURTIN.

240
00:13:10,825 --> 00:13:12,291
HOW DO YOU DO?
- HOW DO YOU DO?

241
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,794
WELL, WE WON, DIDN'T WE?

242
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,295
WHATEVER IT WAS.

243
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,797
WE HAD TO.

244
00:13:17,832 --> 00:13:20,800
DID WE, JIM?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

245
00:13:20,835 --> 00:13:22,802
WE WON TODAY,
BUT I DIDN'T LIKE

246
00:13:22,837 --> 00:13:25,805
THAT BEAT LOOK
IN ANDY BOGGS' EYES.

247
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,307
YOU GET ENOUGH MEN LOOKING
LIKE THAT..

248
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,810
WELL, I DON'T LIKE
WHAT I SEE COMING.

249
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,311
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

250
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,313
OH, THE DOC-
HE DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

251
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,315
YOU'LL GET TO KNOW THE DOC.

252
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,818
I HOPE I GET TO KNOW ALL
OF YOU.

253
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:41,320
AND THAT YOU'RE
GOING TO LIKE ME

254
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:43,823
AS WELL AS I'M GOING
TO LIKE YOU.

255
00:13:43,858 --> 00:13:46,325
THERE YOU ARE, BOYS,
DO YOU SEE NOW WHY I DID IT?

256
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,829
SURE DO. BUT NOW WE'RE WONDERING
WHY YOU WAITED SO LONG.

257
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:52,832
COME ON.

258
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,373
SUCH A HURRY, JIM.
6:00 IN THE MORNING.

259
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,877
COME ON. YOU'LL BE THE FIRST WOMAN
IN THE TERRITORY

260
00:14:37,912 --> 00:14:39,378
EVER MARRIED IN HER SLEEP.

261
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,933
WE MADE IT.

262
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,936
WHAT DID WE MAKE, JIM?
WHERE ARE WE?

263
00:15:36,971 --> 00:15:38,938
THE GREATEST PLACE I KNOW.
COME ON.

264
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,950
THERE IT IS.

265
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,455
IT'S ALL GRASS.

266
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,957
YEAH.

267
00:15:57,992 --> 00:15:59,959
WELL, IT'S JUST...

268
00:15:59,994 --> 00:16:02,461
IT'S SO EMPTY,
SO QUIET.

269
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:03,963
QUIET?

270
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:08,467
MORE NOISE OUT THERE
THAN THERE IS IN ST. LOUIS.

271
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:10,469
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.

272
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,473
WELL, YOU HAVE TO LISTEN FOR IT
BEFORE YOU CAN.

273
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,976
I'M LISTENING, JIM.

274
00:16:17,011 --> 00:16:19,979
ALL I HEAR IS THAT LITTLE
WHISTLE OF A SOUND.

275
00:16:20,014 --> 00:16:21,480
THE WIND?

276
00:16:21,515 --> 00:16:23,983
THERE'S A LOT MORE
THAN THAT OUT THERE.

277
00:16:24,018 --> 00:16:25,484
TELL ME, JIM-WHAT?

278
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,988
WELL...

279
00:16:29,023 --> 00:16:30,489
NO, PLEASE TELL ME.

280
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:31,991
I'LL TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

281
00:16:32,026 --> 00:16:33,492
WHAT DO YOU HEAR
OUT THERE?

282
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,498
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
I GUESS I HEAR THE BUFFALO.

283
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:43,002
BUFFALO? BUT THEY AREN'T
THERE ANYMORE.

284
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,004
THAT'S RIGHT.

285
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:49,008
OH. WHAT ELSE, JIM?i

286
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,011
INDIANS.

287
00:16:52,046 --> 00:16:54,013
GONE, TOO?

288
00:16:54,048 --> 00:16:56,515
HERDED INTO
A RESERVATION.

289
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:01,020
I CAN REMEMBER THE FIRST
TIME I SAW HER.

290
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:04,023
WE'D COME A LONG WAY
AND NOBODY WAS TELLING US

291
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,525
ABOUT ANY SURPRISES, EITHER.

292
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,528
WE JUST CAME OVER THE HILL
AND THERE SHE WAS

293
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:11,530
SORT OF LYING THERE ALL ALONE.

294
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:13,532
NOBODY WANTED HER THEN...

295
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:16,535
EXCEPT THE ANTELOPE AND THE BUFFALO
AND THE INDIANS.

296
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:20,539
SO WE TOOK HER, AND WE SET HER UP
RIGHT FOR COW COUNTRY.

297
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:22,541
WE FOUGHT FOR HER.

298
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:26,045
OUR BLOOD'S SUNK
IN EVERY MILE.

299
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,047
INDIAN BLOOD, TOO.

300
00:17:28,082 --> 00:17:31,050
I'M NOT SO PROUD
OF SOME OF THAT.

301
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,553
MY BROTHER'S OUT THERE.

302
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,059
I SUPPOSE I SOUNDED HARD
TO YOU BACK AT THE TRIAL

303
00:17:40,094 --> 00:17:41,560
AND TO EVERYBODY ELSE.

304
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:43,562
AND I SUPPOSE IT'S HARD
TO UNDERSTAND

305
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:46,565
THAT ALL THAT OUT THERE
IS ANYTHING BUT JUST A LOT OF GRASS

306
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,569
MADE TO ORDER
FOR FARMING.

307
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,572
YES, I SUPPOSE IT IS
JUST GRASS TO MOST.

308
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,575
BUT NOT TO YOU, JIM?

309
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,578
TO ME, IT'S LAND THE WAY GOD
MADE IT

310
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:02,081
AND WANTS IT TO STAY.

311
00:18:02,116 --> 00:18:05,084
AND I MAY BE WRONG
BUT I'VE GOT A HUNCH

312
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,587
THAT HE WANTS ME TO HELP
HIM KEEP IT THAT WAY.

313
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,596
I KNOW IT'S TOO SOON TO EXPECT
YOU TO SEE IT THAT WAY, LUTIE

314
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:19,598
BUT YOU WILL
SEE IT SOME DAY.

315
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:21,100
YOU'VE GOT TO SEE IT.

316
00:18:21,135 --> 00:18:22,601
I WANT TO, JIM.

317
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,124
WELL, THERE SHE IS.

318
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:46,125
THE RANCH.

319
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,127
AND A HOUSE.

320
00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:49,628
HURRY, JIM.

321
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,659
IT'S BETTER INSIDE.

322
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:22,161
YOU BRING MY SHORTENING?

323
00:19:22,196 --> 00:19:24,163
I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING
BETTER THAN SHORTENING.

324
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,165
HERE IT IS.

325
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,167
JEFF, OUR COOK.

326
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:30,669
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF
RIGHT NOW, JEFF?

327
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:32,671
I'M THINKING OF
MY SHORTENING.

328
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:35,174
BANTY, COME HERE.
THIS IS BANTY OUR HORSE WRANGLER.

329
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,675
HOW ARE YOU, BANTY?

330
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,677
I'M FINE, MA'AM.
YOU'RE WELCOME, MA'AM.

331
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,679
THANK YOU. THAT'S A WONDERFUL
WORD, "WELCOME."

332
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,182
GET THOSE BAGS
WILL YOU, JEFF?

333
00:19:43,217 --> 00:19:44,683
COME ON, I'LL SHOW YOU
THE LAYOUT.

334
00:19:44,718 --> 00:19:46,685
FINE. CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE THE KITCHEN.

335
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,187
SHE'S SURE NICE
TO LOOK AT.

336
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,689
SHE BETTER KEEP OUT
OF MY KITCHEN.

337
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:52,691
AND YOU CAN TAKE THEM BAGS IN.

338
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,207
MY...

339
00:20:08,242 --> 00:20:10,209
THIS WILL FIX UP NICELY.

340
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,221
THE STOREROOM?

341
00:20:22,256 --> 00:20:24,723
NO, NO, THIS IS THE PARLOR.
THE LIVING ROOM.

342
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,727
WHO LIVES IN IT,
DEAR?

343
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:30,729
WELL, NOBODY, REALLY,
VERY MUCH.

344
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:33,732
YOU SEE, WE'RE NOT
HERE VERY MUCH.

345
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:37,236
I, UH... I SUPPOSE IF THIS STUFF
WAS MOVED OUT OF HERE,

346
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:39,238
IT EVENTUALLY WOULD GET
TO LOOK

347
00:20:39,273 --> 00:20:41,240
LIKE A LIVING ROOM,
WOULDN'T IT?

348
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:42,741
YES, I SUPPOSE IT WOULD.

349
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,244
I WONDER WHY I DIDN'T
HAVE THIS STUFF

350
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,246
MOVED OUT BEFORE YOU CAME?

351
00:20:47,281 --> 00:20:48,747
DO YOU KNOW?

352
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:50,249
NO, I REALLY DON'T.

353
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,751
WELL, I'LL BE DOGGONE,
NEITHER DO I.

354
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,255
I WANT TO SEE
THE KITCHEN.

355
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,757
IT'S AT THE END
OF THE HALL.

356
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:00,759
UH, TAKE IT EASY
WITH JEFF.

357
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,269
JUDAS.

358
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,774
MAY I COME IN?

359
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,778
JUST LOOKING AROUND,
I'LL GET RIGHT OUT.

360
00:21:19,813 --> 00:21:20,854
I'D BE MUCH OBLIGED.

361
00:21:20,855 --> 00:21:22,781
LORENZO, I'M WAITING ON THAT CABBAGE.

362
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,782
OH, BISCUITS!

363
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,784
WHAT DO THEY LOOK LIKE?

364
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:28,287
LOOK LIKE BISCUITS,
GOOD BISCUITS.

365
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,291
TASTE LIKE THAT, TOO.

366
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:36,295
NOTHING LIKE SOUR MILK AND A BIG OVEN,
IS THERE, JEFF?

367
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,298
BAKING SODA WENT IN FIRST-
YOU CAN TELL THAT.

368
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,300
SHORTENING IN JUST RIGHT TOO...

369
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:42,801
AND DOUGH ROLLED
JUST ENOUGH.

370
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,804
JEFF, HOW WOULD
YOU LIKE TO HAVE A DOLLAR

371
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,306
FOR EVERY BISCUIT
YOU'VE MADE?

372
00:21:47,341 --> 00:21:49,808
I'D TAKE A NICKELOF GRASS
AND I'D OWN THE PLACE.

373
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:50,899
NOT THAT I'D WANT TO.

374
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,811
NOT ANYMORE. NOT NOW.
IT'S TOO CROWDED.

375
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,314
A MAN NEEDS ELBOW ROOM.

376
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:58,817
I WON'T EVEN COME INSIDE YOUR
KITCHEN UNTIL YOU ASK ME TO,

377
00:21:58,852 --> 00:22:00,319
HONESTLY, I WON'T.

378
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,827
SHE ATE ONE. SHE KNEW
WHAT SHE WAS EATING.

379
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,332
TOUGHER THAN WHANG LEATHER.

380
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:16,335
SHE CAN LIE FASTER
THAN A DOG CAN TROT.

381
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,848
WAIT! WAS YOU
BRUNG UP IN A BARN?

382
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,851
NOW, LISTEN, I DON'T WANT
NO REACHING,

383
00:22:32,886 --> 00:22:35,854
NOR EATING WITH KNIFES
NOR DRINKING OUT OF SAUCERS.

384
00:22:35,889 --> 00:22:37,356
THIS HERE WOMAN'S
A LADY.

385
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,360
I'M SCARED.

386
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,861
YOU'RE SCARED?

387
00:22:42,896 --> 00:22:45,364
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE BOYS ARE? COME ON.

388
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:49,868
UP!

389
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,871
LUTIE, THESE ARE THE BOYS.

390
00:22:52,906 --> 00:22:54,373
BOYS, THIS IS
MRS. BREWTON.

391
00:22:54,408 --> 00:22:55,374
HOWDY, MA'AM.

392
00:22:55,409 --> 00:22:56,875
I'M VERY GLAD TO MEET YOU.

393
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,377
THERE.

394
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,381
SIT!

395
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,396
THAT'S YOUR PIECE
RIGHT THERE.

396
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,471
MA'AM...

397
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:33,472
YES, BANTY?

398
00:24:33,507 --> 00:24:36,475
MRS. BREWTON,
THE BOYS...

399
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,976
WE'VE BEEN
THINKING,

400
00:24:38,011 --> 00:24:41,480
AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU WANT
THAT WE CAN DO,

401
00:24:41,515 --> 00:24:44,483
WELL, WE'D ALL-FIRED GLAD TO.

402
00:24:44,518 --> 00:24:47,486
WELL, UM.. THANK YOU, BANTY.
THAT'S NICE.

403
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:49,488
ANYTHING, MA'AM.

404
00:24:49,523 --> 00:24:52,991
WELL, I, UH... LET'S SEE...

405
00:24:53,026 --> 00:24:55,994
OH. YOU KNOW THOSE TREES
DOWN BY THE BROOK?

406
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:56,995
BROOK?

407
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,497
CREEK.
- CREEK? CREEK.

408
00:24:58,532 --> 00:25:01,500
I WONDER IF YOU COULD
PULL THEM OUT FOR ME.

409
00:25:01,535 --> 00:25:02,501
WHY, SURE, MA'AM,

410
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:03,502
IF THEY'RE
BOTHERING YOU ANY

411
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:05,003
WE CAN THROW A ROPE
AROUND 'EM

412
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:06,505
AND YANK 'EM OUT
BY THE ROOTS.

413
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,507
OH, NO. NO, I MEANT
COULD YOU DIG THEM UP

414
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:09,508
AND PLANT THEM AROUND THE HOUSE

415
00:25:09,543 --> 00:25:11,009
SO THAT WE COULD
HAVE SOME SHADE?

416
00:25:11,044 --> 00:25:13,512
IT WOULD BE LOVELY TO FENCE IN
THE WHOLE YARD.

417
00:25:13,547 --> 00:25:15,013
FENCE?

418
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,524
WE'LL DO IT,
MRS. BREWTON-

419
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,526
ALL THE ORNERY
TREES YOU WANT.

420
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:29,027
WE'LL DO IT.
WON'T WE, BOYS?

421
00:25:29,062 --> 00:25:31,530
UH, SURE WILL.

422
00:25:31,565 --> 00:25:34,032
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

423
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,534
GOOD NIGHT, MRS. BREWTON.

424
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:37,035
GOOD NIGHT.

425
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,538
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?

426
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,039
NO, NO, NO.

427
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,042
YOU SAID "FENCE. THAT'S A CUSSWORD
ON THE OPEN RANGE.

428
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:45,544
OH, MY!

429
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,047
COLONEL, I JUST BEEN DOWN
AT THE BARN.

430
00:25:49,082 --> 00:25:51,550
PETE SAYS THAT NEW BULL'S BEEN
FIGHTING AGAIN.

431
00:25:51,585 --> 00:25:53,051
- OH?
CUT UP PRETTY BAD.

432
00:25:53,086 --> 00:25:54,553
OH, I'LL GO
RIGHT DOWN.

433
00:25:54,588 --> 00:25:56,054
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT,
WON'T YOU?

434
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:58,056
I CAN'T TAKE A CHANCE ON
THAT NEW BULL.

435
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:07,566
JEFF, JUST HOW
IMPORTANT IS A BULL?

436
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:10,068
WELL, THIS ONE
IS SURE A BEAUTY.

437
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,572
THERE'S A NEIGHBOR.

438
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:14,573
HUH? WHERE?

439
00:26:14,608 --> 00:26:15,574
THERE.

440
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:18,577
OH, THAT'S JUST
HEADQUARTERS CAMP.

441
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,579
OH.

442
00:26:20,614 --> 00:26:22,080
WE GOT A NEIGHBOR,
THOUGH.

443
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,083
MCGEE RANCH, LAYS RIGHT OVER
ABOUT 15 MILES.

444
00:26:25,118 --> 00:26:27,085
15 MILES?

445
00:26:28,622 --> 00:26:30,589
IS THERE A MRS. MCGEE?

446
00:26:30,624 --> 00:26:32,591
NO. MCGEE'S
AN OLD BACH.

447
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:34,092
OH.

448
00:26:34,127 --> 00:26:37,095
WELL...
GOOD NIGHT, JEFF.

449
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,614
LUTIE.

450
00:26:55,649 --> 00:26:57,115
YES, JIM?

451
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,620
HAVE YOU BEEN CRYING?

452
00:27:01,655 --> 00:27:03,121
NO.

453
00:27:03,156 --> 00:27:04,623
HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING LIKE CRYING?

454
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,124
NO, JIM.

455
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,627
WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN FEELING?

456
00:27:08,662 --> 00:27:12,130
OH, I'VE BEEN...
JUST THINKING.

457
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:14,132
WHAT ABOUT?

458
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:17,636
OH, ABOUT... ABOUT ALL THE THINGS
I'M GOING TO DO

459
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:20,138
HOW I'M GOING TO
FIX UP THE HOUSE.

460
00:27:20,173 --> 00:27:22,641
I'LL GET YOU EVERYTHING
YOU NEED, LUTIE.

461
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,644
YOU'RE SURE
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

462
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,145
VERY SURE.

463
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,647
LUTIE...

464
00:27:28,682 --> 00:27:30,649
ONLY...
- ONLY WHAT?

465
00:27:30,684 --> 00:27:33,151
ONE THING:

466
00:27:33,186 --> 00:27:34,990
I WISH YOU LOOKED AT ME

467
00:27:34,991 --> 00:27:37,656
THE WAY YOU LOOK AT THAT OUT THERE.

468
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,165
CUT ALL THEM COPPERWOODS
OUT OF THE HERD FIRST

469
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,862
MRS. BREWTON DON'T WANT NO
MIXED BREEDS AT THIS END OF THE RANGE.

470
00:27:49,863 --> 00:27:50,669
JUST YEW AND TAMARIND.

471
00:27:50,704 --> 00:27:52,170
HEY, THIS HERE'S A MAVERICK,
AIN'T IT?

472
00:27:52,205 --> 00:27:54,673
SURE 'TIS. BRAND HER
AND LET HER GO.

473
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,175
COMMENCE PLANTING THEM NOW,
CLEAR AROUND THE HOUSE.

474
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,677
YEAH, LIKE A FENCE!

475
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,182
PAT THE DIRT UP NICE
AROUND THEM ROOTS.

476
00:28:04,217 --> 00:28:05,684
THEY'RE KIND OF SPINDLY.

477
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:07,185
I'M AFRAID THE FIRST
GOOD WIND

478
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,187
WILL KNOCK 'EM FLATTER
THAN A FLITTER.

479
00:28:09,222 --> 00:28:11,690
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT
THEM LITTLE TREES.

480
00:28:11,725 --> 00:28:13,191
THEY'RE SKINNY,
BUT THEY'RE AWFUL STUBBORN.

481
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:34,912
THANK YOU, BANTY.

482
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:47,225
I SAW SELINA HALL
IN TOWN YESTERDAY.

483
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,232
SHE'S STILL LIVING IN THAT LEAN-TO
BEHIND THE SALOON.

484
00:28:54,267 --> 00:28:56,735
SHOULD'VE LEFT WHEN
THE OTHER SQUATTERS DID.

485
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,738
SHE'S TAKING IN WASHING NOW.

486
00:28:59,773 --> 00:29:02,240
THE WATER'S LIKE LYE
HER HANDS WERE BLEEDING.

487
00:29:02,275 --> 00:29:04,242
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH HER MAN?

488
00:29:04,277 --> 00:29:07,746
THERE ARE PLENTY OF JOBS IN SALT FORK
IF A MAN WANTS TO WORK.

489
00:29:07,781 --> 00:29:09,748
OH, HE'S WORKING
IN THE SALOON.

490
00:29:09,783 --> 00:29:11,750
HE SMELLS EXACTLY
LIKE BEER.

491
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:18,256
JIM, SAM HALL'S A FARMER.

492
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:20,759
HE'S NOT A MAN TO BE
SMELLING OF BEER.

493
00:29:20,794 --> 00:29:24,763
AND SELINA HAS TO CARRY ALL
THE WATER SHE USES FOR BLOCKS.

494
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:27,766
WELL, YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO FIND
MUCH WATER AROUND A SALOON.

495
00:29:27,801 --> 00:29:29,267
OH, JIM.

496
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,774
SHE'S HAVING ANOTHER ONE,
YOU KNOW.

497
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:36,775
HUSBAND?

498
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,276
BABY.

499
00:29:38,311 --> 00:29:40,278
OH.

500
00:29:40,313 --> 00:29:43,782
SHE CAN'T HAVE IT IN THAT LEAN-TO
BEHIND THE SALOON.

501
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,786
SELINA SAYS THEY'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT FILING

502
00:29:47,821 --> 00:29:50,288
ON A SPOT NEAR
MULE CREEK FLAT.

503
00:29:50,323 --> 00:29:53,291
RIGHT SMACK IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY HEADQUARTERS RANGE.

504
00:29:53,326 --> 00:29:55,794
YES. NICE AND CLOSE
TO US, ISN'T?

505
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:57,796
WHAT IS NICE ABOUT
BEING CLOSE?

506
00:29:57,831 --> 00:30:00,298
JIM, SELINA'S MY FRIEND.

507
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:01,800
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE
I'VE GOT OUT HERE.

508
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,301
SHE'D BE A NEIGHBOR.

509
00:30:03,336 --> 00:30:05,804
YOUR WORK TAKES YOU AWAY
SO MUCH.

510
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,305
I'M NOT COMPLAINING, DARLING.

511
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,307
BUT SHE'D BE SOMEONE
TO TALK TO.

512
00:30:09,342 --> 00:30:11,309
WOMEN LIKE
TO TALK A LOT.

513
00:30:11,344 --> 00:30:13,311
YES, I KNOW.

514
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,315
NO, THANKS.

515
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,321
THEY COULD BE SETTLED
BEFORE THE BABY COMES.

516
00:30:23,356 --> 00:30:25,323
THAT'LL BE IN APRIL.

517
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,328
I'LL HAVE MINE IN MAY.

518
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,331
YOU'LL WHAT?

519
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,333
HAVE YOU SEEN DOC REID?

520
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,835
MM-HMM.

521
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:37,836
LUTIE!

522
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,844
GOOD GIRL, LUTIE

523
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:48,346
GOOD BOY, JIM.

524
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:50,348
SELINA SAYS SHE WANTS A BOY.

525
00:30:50,383 --> 00:30:54,352
I'LL BUY YOU A WHOLE FLOOR OF THE BEST
HOSPITAL IN DENVER.

526
00:30:54,387 --> 00:30:56,855
WHAT FOR? HOME'S THE PLACE
TO HAVE A BABY.

527
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,857
WONDER WHERE SELINA
WILL HAVE HERS.

528
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,359
OUT UNDER A BUSH SOMEWHERE,
I SUPPOSE.

529
00:31:01,394 --> 00:31:04,863
I HAVE A HUNCH IT'S GOING
TO BE SOMEWHERE ON MULE CREEK FLAT.

530
00:31:04,898 --> 00:31:08,366
OH, JIM! YOU'LL LIKE THE HALLS
WHEN YOU GET TO KNOW THEM.

531
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:09,868
I DON'T EXPECT TO GET TO
KNOW THEM.

532
00:31:09,903 --> 00:31:10,869
WHY?

533
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,871
I DON'T THINK THEY'LL
BE HERE LONG ENOUGH.

534
00:31:12,906 --> 00:31:14,372
DON'T BE CRUEL, JIM.

535
00:31:14,407 --> 00:31:16,875
I WON'T HAVE TO. THE COUNTRY HERE
TAKES CARE OF ITSELF, LUTIE.

536
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,877
I DON'T KNOW JUST HOW
IT WILL HAPPEN,

537
00:31:18,912 --> 00:31:20,879
BUT I'LL GIVE THEM
ABOUT 6 MONTHS.

538
00:31:20,914 --> 00:31:22,881
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
FIND OUT ALL THAT

539
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:24,382
FOR YOURSELF,
AREN'T YOU?

540
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:26,384
ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD.
TELL THEM TO FILE,

541
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:28,887
AND AS LONG AS THEY'RE HERE,
I'LL BE NICE TO THEM.

542
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,389
I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH,
COLONEL BREWTON.

543
00:31:31,424 --> 00:31:33,391
KIND OF TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF ME

544
00:31:33,426 --> 00:31:35,393
YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU,
MRS. BREWTON?

545
00:31:35,428 --> 00:31:37,395
THAT'S WHAT AN ADVANTAGE IS FOR.

546
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:43,401
THIS KiD BETTER LOOK LIKE YOU,
OR I'LL DROWN IT.

547
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,430
HI!

548
00:32:12,465 --> 00:32:15,433
HELLO, SELINA! WHOA.

549
00:32:15,468 --> 00:32:17,435
WE'RE GETTING A SOD HOUSE UP.

550
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,437
WHAT A COUNTRY-
MAN NEEDS A HOUSE,

551
00:32:19,472 --> 00:32:21,940
HE JUST DIGS IT
OUT OF THE GROUND.

552
00:32:21,975 --> 00:32:23,942
YES, QUITE A COUNTRY
AND GETTING BETTER.

553
00:32:23,977 --> 00:32:24,943
WHY, MR. CHAMBERLAIN.

554
00:32:24,978 --> 00:32:26,945
MRS. BREWTON.

555
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,447
SAY, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU FOLKS
WAS ACQUAINTED.

556
00:32:29,482 --> 00:32:32,450
OH, YES. MR. CHAMBERLAIN
IS AN OLD, OLD FRIEND AND ADVISOR.

557
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,452
DID HE ADVISE YOU TOO, SELINA?

558
00:32:34,487 --> 00:32:36,454
SHOWED US HOW TO
FILE ON THIS LAND,

559
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:37,956
IF YOU CALL THAT ADVISING.

560
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:39,958
I BROUGHT A PRESENT FOR LITTLE MOLLY.

561
00:32:39,993 --> 00:32:41,960
HIS NAME IS
REDEYE SON-OF-A-GUN.

562
00:32:41,995 --> 00:32:43,962
HERE, MOLLY. HERE'S
A PRESENT FOR YOU.

563
00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:45,964
I HOPE YOU CAN USE ALL THAT
STUFF, SELINA.

564
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,966
WHY, HONEY, I CAN USE ANYTHING

565
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:49,968
FROM A BUTTONHOOK TO
A KITCHEN RANGE.

566
00:32:50,003 --> 00:32:52,470
COLONEL BREWTON SENT US OVER
A SIDE OF BEEF.

567
00:32:52,505 --> 00:32:54,472
THIS BUFFALO GRASS SURE
GOES DOWN DEEP.

568
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:55,974
HELLO, SAM!s

569
00:32:56,009 --> 00:32:59,978
I'D FEEL A LOT EASIER IF YOU'D TAKE
THAT BEEF BACK, MRS. BREWTON.

570
00:33:00,013 --> 00:33:01,479
WE DON'T NEED IT.

571
00:33:01,514 --> 00:33:03,481
SHUT UP SAM,
SURE WE NEED IT.

572
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,984
WELL, MAYBE WE DO-
FOR EATING PURPOSES.

573
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:08,987
BUT I'D SURE CHOKE ON IT
IF I FIGURED TAKING IT

574
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,488
GAVE ANYBODY
ANY WRONG IDEAS.

575
00:33:10,523 --> 00:33:12,991
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE
GOT A RIGHT TO BE HERE.

576
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,493
NOBODY'S LETTING US
DO ANYTHING.

577
00:33:15,528 --> 00:33:17,996
WE'RE JUST DOING IT AND
WE CAN TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES.

578
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:19,998
I KNOW THAT, SAM.

579
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:21,499
YOU WANT LUTIE TO FEEL
SHE AIN'T WELCOME?

580
00:33:21,534 --> 00:33:23,501
THAT AIN'T WHAT I MEAN,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

581
00:33:23,536 --> 00:33:26,004
YOU WANT TO COME TO SEE MY WIFE
HERE ON OUR PLACE,

582
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,505
YOU COME, AND MOST WELCOME,
MRS. BREWTON.

583
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,007
THANK YOU, SAM.

584
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,510
DON'T TAKE SAM
SERIOUS.

585
00:33:32,545 --> 00:33:34,012
HE'S JUST BEING A MAN.

586
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,014
I KNOW. THEY'RE RATHER PECULIAR PEOPLE

587
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:37,015
SOMETIMES, AREN'T THEY?

588
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,516
SOMETIMES?!

589
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,022
YOU KNOW, I OWE YOU
AN APOLOGY.

590
00:33:44,057 --> 00:33:45,523
WHEN YOU FIRST DROVE UP TODAY,
I THOUGHT

591
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,525
"HERE COMES
LADY BOUNTIFUL."

592
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,528
I TAKE IT BACK. YOU'RE REALLY
FOND OF SAM AND SELINA HALL.

593
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,031
SELINA WAS MY FIRST FRIEND OUT HERE.

594
00:33:53,066 --> 00:33:54,532
I'M AWFULLY GLAD SHE DOESN'T
SEEM LONELY.

595
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,534
DID YOU EXPECT HER TO BE?

596
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:58,536
WELL, THIS IS THE PLACE FOR IT.

597
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,038
HARDLY A WOMAN'COUNTRY.

598
00:34:00,073 --> 00:34:01,539
IT COULD BE.

599
00:34:01,574 --> 00:34:03,541
IT SHOULD BE,
AND SOMEDAY IT WILL.

600
00:34:03,576 --> 00:34:05,543
WHEN? HOW?

601
00:34:05,578 --> 00:34:08,046
WHY NOT? IT'S HAPPENED
IN OTHER PLACES.

602
00:34:08,081 --> 00:34:10,548
FIRST THE COVERED WAGONS,
THEN THE HOUSES,

603
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:12,550
THEN THE FARMS-FAMILIES,
CHILDREN GROWING UP.

604
00:34:12,585 --> 00:34:15,553
SURE, IT WILL BE A WOMAN'S COUNTRY THEN.

605
00:34:15,588 --> 00:34:17,555
WOMEN WILL HELP
MAKE IT THEIRS.

606
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:20,058
DO YOU HEAR THAT,
MR. CHAMBERLAIN?

607
00:34:20,093 --> 00:34:21,059
THE HEAR IT?

608
00:34:21,094 --> 00:34:23,061
THE PEOPLE, I MEAN,
OUT THERE.

609
00:34:23,096 --> 00:34:25,063
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF
SELINAS AND SAMS

610
00:34:25,098 --> 00:34:26,564
REALLY, ISN'T IT?

611
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:28,066
COLONEL BREWTON HEARS SOMETHING
SO DIFFERENT.

612
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,069
I'M AFRAID YOU'VE GOT ME WRONG.
I DON'T HEAR ANY VOICES.

613
00:34:31,104 --> 00:34:34,072
I ONLY KNOW THIS IS GOOD LAND
THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING

614
00:34:34,107 --> 00:34:36,074
UNLESS PEOPLE GET
THEIR LIVING OUT IT.

615
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:37,575
USE IT, LIVE ON IT.

616
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:41,079
THAT'S WHERE I COME IN.
I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS.

617
00:34:41,114 --> 00:34:43,081
ANYWAY, I'LL MAKE
A STAB AT IT.

618
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,084
I TURN BACK HERE.

619
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:48,586
MAYBE THEN, THIS WOULD BE
MY COUNTRY TOO.

620
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,093
AND YOU-
WHAT DO YOU HEAR?

621
00:34:55,128 --> 00:34:57,095
I'VE BEEN TOLD
THAT A GOOD WIFE

622
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,597
HEARS ONLY WHAT HER HUSBAND
WANTS HER TO HEAR.

623
00:34:59,632 --> 00:35:02,100
WELL, WHAT AN OLD-FASHIONED IDEA.

624
00:35:02,135 --> 00:35:04,102
DON'T BE UNFAIR,
MR. CHAMBERLAIN.

625
00:35:04,137 --> 00:35:06,104
YOU MUST ADMIT THAT
COLONEL BREWTON'S

626
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:08,606
MADE IT EASY
FOR SELINA AND SAM.

627
00:35:08,641 --> 00:35:11,109
ONE SIDE OF BEEF?
CONSCIENCE MONEY.

628
00:35:11,144 --> 00:35:12,610
YOU ARE UNFAIR.

629
00:35:12,645 --> 00:35:15,113
I'M REALISTIC. DON'T FORGET
IT'S ONLY ONE SAM, ONE SELINA

630
00:35:15,148 --> 00:35:17,115
AND ONE SIDE OF BEEF.

631
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,617
YOU SPEAK OF THOUSANDS.

632
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,620
I'M WONDERING WHY
BREWTON EVEN HELPED ONE.

633
00:35:22,655 --> 00:35:24,622
HE'S A PIRATE, YOU KNOW.

634
00:35:24,657 --> 00:35:27,625
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM,
THAT'S ALL. I DO.

635
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,130
WHY DO WOMEN INSIST ON LOVING MEN

636
00:35:32,165 --> 00:35:35,133
FOR WHAT THEY WANT THEM TO BE
INSTEAD OF WHAT THEY ARE?

637
00:35:35,168 --> 00:35:36,634
GOOD DAY, MR. CHAMBERLAIN.

638
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,637
YOU KNOW, I ENVY BREWTON
VERY MUCH.

639
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,140
YOU MEAN, YOU ENVY
THE PIRATE HIS LOOT?

640
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,142
NOT ALL OF IT.
JUST ONE THING.

641
00:35:44,177 --> 00:35:46,644
I'LL GET AROUND TO TELLING YOU
WHAT IT IS SOME DAY.

642
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,147
COME NOW, MR. CHAMBERLAIN,
I'M NOT A CHILD.

643
00:35:49,182 --> 00:35:50,648
I DISLIKE THIS
SCURRYING ABOUT.

644
00:35:50,683 --> 00:35:54,652
IF YOU THINK I'M ATTRACTIVE, WHY DON'T
YOU SAY SO AND GET IT OVER WITH.

645
00:35:54,687 --> 00:35:56,654
THAT ISN'T WHAT I MEANT,
BUT NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT

646
00:35:56,689 --> 00:35:58,656
YOU ARE ATTRACTIVE.

647
00:35:58,691 --> 00:35:59,657
YOU'RE VERYATTRACTIVE.

648
00:35:59,692 --> 00:36:01,659
I KNOW IT, AND YOU KNOW
I KNOW IT.

649
00:36:01,694 --> 00:36:03,661
YOU'VE KNOWN IT
SINCE THE FIRST TIME I LOOKED AT YOU.

650
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,664
YES, I-I HAVE MR. CHAMBERLAIN.

651
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:10,168
AND NOW YOU'VE SAID IT
AND WE'RE DONE WITH IT.

652
00:36:10,203 --> 00:36:13,671
ARE WE?
I DON'T THINK SO.

653
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,713
THE COMPANY'S ALL HERE.

654
00:36:55,748 --> 00:36:56,714
AIN'T THAT BABY ASLEEP YET?

655
00:36:56,749 --> 00:36:58,216
NOW, YOU GO ON AND GET OUT OF HERE

656
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,717
YOU'RE KEEPING HER ALL RILED UP.

657
00:36:59,752 --> 00:37:01,219
AND KEEP HER
OUT OF MY WAY TOO

658
00:37:01,254 --> 00:37:03,221
IF YOU WANT ME TO GET
THIS CHILD TO SLEEP.

659
00:37:03,256 --> 00:37:04,222
EVERYTHING READY
DOWNSTAIRS, JEFF?

660
00:37:04,257 --> 00:37:05,723
WELL, OF COURSE IT IS,

661
00:37:05,758 --> 00:37:07,225
ELSE WHY I'VE BEEN OVER THAT STOVE
SINCE DAYLIGHT?

662
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,425
NOW, GO ON, GIT!

663
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,727
GOOD NIGHT, SARAH BETH.

664
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,732
YOU TOO. NOW GO ON.
GET OUT OF HERE. VAMOOSE!

665
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,756
SURE IS LIGHT-FOOTED, AIN'T HE?

666
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:40,758
LIGHT-FINGERED, TOO,
IT BEGINS TO LOOK LIKE.

667
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,761
GENTLEMEN, I GIVE YOU
THE LADY FROM ST. LOUIS.

668
00:37:43,796 --> 00:37:46,264
A GOOD TOAST TO REMEMBER
IN THIS HOUSE.

669
00:37:46,299 --> 00:37:47,765
DRINK HEARTY, GENTLEMEN.

670
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,291
I KNOW YOU OF OLD

671
00:38:13,326 --> 00:38:18,296
YOU ROBBED MY POOR FATHER
OF SILVER AND GOLD.

672
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,798
OH, WHISKEY, RYE WHISKEY...

673
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:21,799
WHAT ARE YOU SINGING?

674
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,802
IT'S A LULLABY, AND IT WON'T DO
MUCH LULLING

675
00:38:24,837 --> 00:38:27,305
IF YOU PEOPLE KEEP COMING IN HERE
AND STOMPING AROUND.

676
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,806
HOW DO I LOOK, JEFF?

677
00:38:28,841 --> 00:38:30,808
REAL PRETTY.

678
00:38:30,843 --> 00:38:33,311
GO TO SLEEP, BABY...

679
00:38:33,346 --> 00:38:35,313
JEFF, DO YOU EVER GET TIRED

680
00:38:35,348 --> 00:38:37,315
OF COOKING FOR ALL
THESE PARTIES?

681
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:40,818
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT IF
I WAS YOU, COLONEL.

682
00:38:40,853 --> 00:38:43,821
WOMEN GOT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF
PARTIES IN THEIR SYSTEM,

683
00:38:43,856 --> 00:38:46,324
AND THEY JUST GOT
TO GET 'EM OUT.

684
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:53,331
GO TO SLEEP BABY...
GO TO SLEEP NOW.

685
00:38:53,366 --> 00:38:54,832
JEFF, YOU'RE A WONDERFUL MOTHER.

686
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,339
YOU KNOW, BEING STIRRED UP
MUST BE GOOD FOR YOU, LUTIE.

687
00:39:01,374 --> 00:39:04,342
BEEN MARRIED A WHOLE YEAR
AND STILL DON'T LOOK LIKE A WIFE.

688
00:39:04,377 --> 00:39:05,843
STOP IT, BRICE.

689
00:39:05,878 --> 00:39:07,845
WHAT KEEPS YOU
SO STIRRED UP, LUTIE?

690
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,354
YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING
YOU WANT, HAVEN'T YOU?

691
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:18,356
STOP IT.
STOP IT, BRICE.

692
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:20,358
YOU CAN STOP ME EASY.

693
00:39:20,393 --> 00:39:22,360
JUST TELL ME YOU'VE GOT
EVERYTHING YOU WANT.

694
00:39:22,395 --> 00:39:25,363
TELL ME YOU'VE GOT EVEN PART
OF WHAT YOU WANT.

695
00:39:25,398 --> 00:39:27,365
OH, COME ON, LUTIE,
WHY DON'T YOU ANSWER ME?

696
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,368
I'LL TELL YOU WHY- BECAUSE YOU
DON'T LIE VERY WELL.

697
00:39:30,403 --> 00:39:32,870
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN SAY
THAT YOU'RE NOT AFRAID TO SAY.

698
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,883
JUST WHITE SAND,
JUST AS SOFT AS-

699
00:39:45,918 --> 00:39:48,386
HELLO, NICK.
DANCE WITH ME, JIM.

700
00:39:48,421 --> 00:39:49,887
WHAT'S THE MATTER, LUTIE?

701
00:39:49,922 --> 00:39:52,390
NOTHING. THIS IS YOUR DANCE,
THAT'S ALL.

702
00:39:52,425 --> 00:39:53,391
PLEASE.

703
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,431
MADE YOU SOME TEA.

704
00:40:33,466 --> 00:40:34,432
THANK YOU, JEFF.

705
00:40:34,467 --> 00:40:37,435
MAYBE IT WILL WARM ME
UP A LITTLE.

706
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,936
A REAL HEAVY SNOWFALL.

707
00:40:38,971 --> 00:40:40,438
SNOWFALL? IT'S A BLIZZARD.

708
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,942
I'M WORRIED ABOUT
THE COLONEL, JEFF.

709
00:40:44,977 --> 00:40:47,445
HE HASN'T BEEN HOME FOR 48 HOURS.

710
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,448
OH, I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.
HE'S ALL RIGHT.

711
00:40:50,483 --> 00:40:52,950
HE'S ALWAYS ALL RIGHT.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE CATTLE.

712
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,978
HEY, KEEP THEM AWAY FROM
THAT BARBED WIRE!

713
00:41:21,013 --> 00:41:22,480
HEAD 'EM OFF!

714
00:41:22,515 --> 00:41:24,982
FENCE! KEEP 'EM OUT
OF THE HALLS'

715
00:41:25,017 --> 00:41:26,484
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, SAM?

716
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:28,486
I TOLD BREWTON'S MEN THE NEXT STEER
THAT BUSTED DOWN MY FENCE

717
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:29,987
WAS GONNA GET BLOWN
TO PIECES.

718
00:41:30,022 --> 00:41:30,988
BUT, SAM, THEM CATTLE
DON'T KNOW WHERE

719
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,389
THEY'RE DRIFTING IN THIS STORM.

720
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,491
MAYBE THEY'LL HEAD
THE OTHER WAY.

721
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,993
DON'T GO OUT THERE, SAM.
IT'S ONLY LOOKING FOR TROUBLE.

722
00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:36,994
TROUBLE? IT WAS
TROUBLE LAST SUMMER

723
00:41:37,029 --> 00:41:38,496
WHEN THEM CATTLE
TROMPLED OUR RYE CROP

724
00:41:38,531 --> 00:41:39,997
BEFORE WE COULD HARVEST IT,
WASN'T IT?

725
00:41:40,032 --> 00:41:41,499
I GOT FALL WHEAT PLANTED
OUT THERE

726
00:41:41,534 --> 00:41:44,001
AND I AIN'T GONNA STAND BY
AND SEE IT GET RUINED!

727
00:41:44,036 --> 00:41:45,503
SELINA, WITH THE NEW BABY COMING

728
00:41:45,538 --> 00:41:47,505
IF WE DON'T MAKE THIS CROP
WE GOT TO GIVE UP.

729
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,006
NO, SAM! DON'T!

730
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,509
SAM, STAY HERE!

731
00:41:51,544 --> 00:41:55,513
SAM! COME BACK! SAM!

732
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,021
KEEP THEM CATTLE
OUT OF MY WHEAT!

733
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,526
GET 'EM OUT OF THERE!

734
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,534
SAM, LOOK OUT!

735
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,546
COME ON, LET'S GET HIM!
KILL THAT YELLOWBELLY!

736
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,567
SAM!

737
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,072
SAM. SAM...

738
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,583
SAM.

739
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,105
SAM. SAM!

740
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,107
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT,
SELINA.

741
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,629
JEFF, JEFF!

742
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,134
IS JIM BACK?

743
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,137
NO, MRS. BREWTON,
THE COLONEL AIN'T HOME YET.

744
00:44:00,172 --> 00:44:01,639
WELL, THEN WHAT'S HAPPENED, JEFF?

745
00:44:01,674 --> 00:44:03,140
SOME OF THE BOYS
JUST GOT IN.

746
00:44:03,175 --> 00:44:04,141
I HEATED UP SOME COFFEE.

747
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,143
NOW, YOU GET BACK TO BED. IT'S COLD.

748
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,146
NO, I'M NOT GOING BACK TO BED
UNTIL YOU TELL ME WHAT'S HAPPENED.

749
00:44:09,181 --> 00:44:11,148
IT WAS NOTHING MUCH.
A LITTLE BLOWUP OVER AT HALLS.

750
00:44:11,183 --> 00:44:12,149
HALL SHOT ONE OF OUR STEERS,

751
00:44:12,184 --> 00:44:14,151
AND THE BOYS KIND OF WORKED HIM
OVER. NOW GIT.

752
00:44:14,186 --> 00:44:15,653
WORKED HIM OVER BAD?

753
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,154
WELL, THE BOYS SAID "GOOD."

754
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,156
I'M GOING OVER TO THE HALLS.

755
00:44:19,191 --> 00:44:21,158
YOU AIN'T GOING NOWHERE.
THERE'S DRIFTS.

756
00:44:21,193 --> 00:44:23,160
YOU GET ME A HORSE.
SELINA'S EXPECTING ANOTHER BABY

757
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,663
I'M GOING TO SEE
IF SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

758
00:44:25,698 --> 00:44:27,164
WELL, WRAP UP WARM.

759
00:44:57,194 --> 00:45:00,197
SAM! I'VE COME
TO SEE SELINA.

760
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,701
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

761
00:45:03,736 --> 00:45:05,202
LET ME IN, SAM.

762
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:06,704
NO.

763
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:08,205
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

764
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,708
SHE TRIED TO HELP ME.
THE BABY'S DEAD.

765
00:45:10,743 --> 00:45:11,709
NO, SAM...

766
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,711
MAKE HER GO AWAY, SAM.

767
00:45:13,746 --> 00:45:16,714
I DON'T EVER WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN.
SEND HER AWAY!

768
00:45:16,749 --> 00:45:17,715
SELINA-

769
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:18,716
YOU HEARD WHAT SHE SAID.

770
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,217
NOW, GO ON BACK TO BREWTON.

771
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,720
TELL HIM HE'S WON.
TELL HIM HES WON A BIG VICTORY.

772
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,221
WE LEAVE NOW.

773
00:45:24,256 --> 00:45:26,223
NOW GO ON. GET OUT.

774
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,254
WHOA.

775
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,762
GOOD. LOOK AFTER HIM

776
00:46:04,797 --> 00:46:06,263
SURE, COLONEL.

777
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,282
LUTIE, I HEARD
ABOUT THE HALLS.

778
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:26,784
YES.

779
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:28,786
IT WAS A BAD NIGHT
ALL AROUND.

780
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,788
I LOST A COUPLE
OF HUNDRED HEAD.

781
00:46:30,823 --> 00:46:32,289
SORRY, JIM.

782
00:46:32,324 --> 00:46:35,292
WELL, IT'S NICE TO HOME
AGAIN WITH YOU.

783
00:46:35,327 --> 00:46:37,795
JIM, SELINA'S BABY
IS DEAD.

784
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,298
I KNOW. TOO BAD.

785
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,301
JIM...

786
00:46:44,336 --> 00:46:47,304
JIM, SHE'S SO BITTER
AND SO LOST.

787
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:50,307
WE'VE GOT TO LET HER
KNOW HOW SORRY WE ARE.

788
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,309
WE'VE GOT TO HELP THEM.

789
00:46:52,344 --> 00:46:56,313
THE BEST WAY TO HELP THEM
IS TO STAY AWAY FROM THEM.

790
00:46:56,348 --> 00:46:59,316
JIM, THEY SAY THEY'RE LEAVING.

791
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:00,818
LET THEM GO.

792
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,824
I MADE A MISTAKE BEFORE, LUTIE.

793
00:47:06,859 --> 00:47:09,326
I SHOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN IN TO YOU.
I WON'T AGAIN.

794
00:47:09,361 --> 00:47:12,830
THE TIME I DID THOSE PEOPLE HARM
WAS WHEN LET THEM FILE.

795
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,331
MY FAULT, LUTIE
NOT YOURS.

796
00:47:14,366 --> 00:47:16,333
JIM, IF YOU WON'T
HELP THE HALLS

797
00:47:16,368 --> 00:47:18,335
FOR THEMSELVES,
THEN DO IT FOR ME.

798
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:20,337
I LOVE SELINA, AND RIGHT
NOW, SHE HATES ME.

799
00:47:20,372 --> 00:47:21,839
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO, LUTIE.

800
00:47:21,874 --> 00:47:24,341
THIS WOULD ONLY HAPPEN AGAIN,
OR SOMETHING SIMILAR.

801
00:47:24,376 --> 00:47:26,844
IT FIGURED TO HAPPEN.
THIS TOUGH COUNTRY, LUTIE.

802
00:47:26,879 --> 00:47:28,345
THIS COUNTRY, I'M SICK TO DEATH

803
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,847
OF TALKING ABOUT THIS COUNTRY.

804
00:47:29,882 --> 00:47:31,348
YOU REALLY
THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT

805
00:47:31,383 --> 00:47:32,349
THAN THE PEOPLE IN IT.

806
00:47:32,384 --> 00:47:33,851
WELL, THAT DEPENDS,
IT DEPENDS ON

807
00:47:33,886 --> 00:47:35,853
WHO THE PEOPLE ARE
AND WHAT THEY'RE UP TO.

808
00:47:35,888 --> 00:47:37,855
YOU LET SELINA AND SAM HALL STAY HERE

809
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,357
BECAUSE YOU WANTED SOMETHING
LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN-

810
00:47:40,392 --> 00:47:41,859
TO SHOW ME,
TO SHOW EVERYONE

811
00:47:41,894 --> 00:47:43,861
YOU DON'T CARE
HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE.

812
00:47:43,896 --> 00:47:46,864
JUST SO LONG AS YOU KEEP THE GRASS
FOR YOURSELF.

813
00:47:46,899 --> 00:47:47,865
LUTIE...

814
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,873
LUTIE... I'LL TRY TO TELL YOU, LUTIE.

815
00:47:55,908 --> 00:47:57,875
IT'S HARD TO SAY
BUT...

816
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,379
THE HALLS DON'T COUNT
FOR MUCH, LUTIE.

817
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,381
NEITHER DO WE.

818
00:48:04,416 --> 00:48:06,383
BUT THAT OUT THERE
DOES...

819
00:48:06,418 --> 00:48:08,886
AND MEN LIKE CHAMBERLAIN,
THEY WANT TO FARM IT.

820
00:48:08,921 --> 00:48:11,889
THEY WANT TO DIG IT UP
AND DRAW THE WATER OUT OF ITS VEINS,

821
00:48:11,924 --> 00:48:13,891
LET THE SUN GET AT IT,
WAY DOWN DEEP.

822
00:48:13,926 --> 00:48:15,893
IT WOULD CURL UP
AND DIE THEN, LUTIE,

823
00:48:15,928 --> 00:48:17,895
IT WOULD BE DEAD,
AND SO WOULD THE WHOLE COUNTRY,

824
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:18,896
IT WOULD NEVER LIVE AGAIN.

825
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:27,905
I TRIED TO TELL YOU, LUTIE,
BUT YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT, DID YOU?

826
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,407
WE WON'T ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

827
00:48:30,442 --> 00:48:33,410
THAT'S RIGHT NO TALK, JUST YOU
AND THE GRASS THE OUT THERE.

828
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,413
THAT'S REALLY THE WAY
YOU WANT IT, ISN'T IT?

829
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,918
NO, LUTIE. I WANT
YOU WITH IT, TOO.

830
00:48:40,953 --> 00:48:42,920
YOU DON'T NEED ME,
YOU NEVER DID.

831
00:48:42,955 --> 00:48:44,421
LUTIE...

832
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,423
YOU'VE NEVER LIVED WITH ME.

833
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:48,926
I'VE BEEN HERE.
YOU'VE BEEN OUT THERE.

834
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:01,939
JIM, I'D LIKE TO GO AWAY.

835
00:49:01,974 --> 00:49:03,440
I'VE GOT TO.

836
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,445
IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA.

837
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,948
YOU COULD DO A LITTLE
SHOPPING IN DENVER.

838
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,952
SOME THINKING TOO.

839
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,965
DENVER PAPER!
ROCKY MOUNTAIN NEWS!

840
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,967
NEWS?

841
00:49:30,002 --> 00:49:31,969
DENVER PAPER?

842
00:49:32,004 --> 00:49:34,471
CALL FOR MR. O'CONNOR!

843
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,974
CALL FOR
MR. O'CONNOR!

844
00:49:37,009 --> 00:49:38,976
WELL, SIR, I FIGURE IF WE'RE EVER GOING

845
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,978
TO BREAK THE HOLD
OF THE CATTLEMEN,

846
00:49:41,013 --> 00:49:43,480
WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE SALT FORK
A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT.

847
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,304
AND SEE TO IT THAT AN IMPARTIAL JUDGE
IS APPOINTED. - RIGHT.

848
00:49:46,518 --> 00:49:48,485
HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR STAY
AT THE BROWN PALACE, MRS. BREWTON.

849
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,488
THE MARSHALL ALWAYS WINDS UP
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

850
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,991
EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN, ONE MOMENT.

851
00:49:54,026 --> 00:49:55,993
LUTIE! IN DENVEROF ALL PLACES!

852
00:49:56,028 --> 00:49:57,995
BUT NOT FOR LONG.

853
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:00,998
LONG ENOUGH TO TAKE
PITY ON ME AT DINNER TONIGHT.

854
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,501
I'M AFRAID NOT BRICE,
MY TRAIN GOES IN THE MORNING, VERY EARLY.

855
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,504
THERE'S NO TRAIN LEAVING
FOR SALT FORK IN THE MORNING.

856
00:50:07,539 --> 00:50:09,506
THIS TRAIN GOES TO ST. LOUIS.

857
00:50:09,541 --> 00:50:11,008
OH, I'M SORRY, LUTIE.

858
00:50:11,043 --> 00:50:12,509
I UNDERSTAND, OF COURSE

859
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,511
YOU DON'T WANT TO
SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE.

860
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,017
LUTIE...

861
00:50:20,052 --> 00:50:22,519
I HAVE A SLEIGH
WITH A DRIVER.

862
00:50:22,554 --> 00:50:25,022
CONSIDER IT YOURS
IF YOU'D LIKE SOME AIR.

863
00:50:25,057 --> 00:50:27,524
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BRICE.
THAT'S VERY SWEET OF YOU.

864
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,027
WITHOUT ME, OF COURSE.

865
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,031
CALL FOR ME AT 8:00.

866
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,543
BREWTON'S A BIG MAN,
I'VE NEVER DENIED IT.

867
00:50:46,578 --> 00:50:50,047
BUT, WELL, IT JUST DOESN'T LEAVE
ROOM FOR ANYONE ELSE-

868
00:50:50,082 --> 00:50:51,548
FOR YOU, IN THIS CASE.

869
00:50:51,583 --> 00:50:53,203
I USED TO WONDER HOW LONG

870
00:50:53,204 --> 00:50:56,053
IT WOULD TAKE YOU TO
ADMIT THAT TO YOURSELF.

871
00:50:56,088 --> 00:50:58,555
YOU NEVER REALLY EXPECTED
HIM TO CHANGE, DID YOU?

872
00:50:58,590 --> 00:50:59,667
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,

873
00:50:59,668 --> 00:51:02,559
IT WAS REALLY YOUR FAULT.
YOU KNEW IT WAS HOPELESS.

874
00:51:02,594 --> 00:51:05,062
YOU KNEW IT THE FIRST
TIME I SAW YOU.

875
00:51:05,097 --> 00:51:07,064
YOU KNEW IT
IN THE COURTROOM.

876
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:10,567
IT'S BEEN WRITTEN ALL OVER YOUR FACE
EVERY TIME SINCE THEN.

877
00:51:10,602 --> 00:51:12,569
THE HALLS WERE YOUR FAULT, TOO.

878
00:51:12,604 --> 00:51:16,073
YOU INSISTED ON PLUNKING THEM DOWN
RIGHT IN THE LION'S DEN.

879
00:51:16,108 --> 00:51:20,077
AND SAT AROUND HOPING
NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN.

880
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,579
WELL, IT HAPPENED.

881
00:51:22,614 --> 00:51:25,582
IT WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN
BREWTON BEING BREWTON.

882
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:35,592
OH, LUTIE, I'M SORRY,
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.

883
00:51:35,627 --> 00:51:37,594
I JUST WANT TO CRY,
THAT'S ALL.

884
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,097
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU.

885
00:51:40,132 --> 00:51:43,100
IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S FINE,

886
00:51:43,135 --> 00:51:45,102
ONLY, ONLY...

887
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,106
I FEEL THAT IT'S THE FIRST TIME

888
00:51:49,141 --> 00:51:51,108
THAT ANYONE
HAS SPOKEN TO ME

889
00:51:51,143 --> 00:51:53,610
IN MONTHS IN MONTHS
IN MONTHS

890
00:51:53,645 --> 00:51:56,113
I MEAN, ABOUT ME.

891
00:51:56,613 --> 00:52:00,117
ANYWAY, WHAT YOU SAY
IS TRUE.

892
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,120
AND I DON'T MIND
LOOKING AT IT AT LAST.

893
00:52:03,155 --> 00:52:05,122
IT DOESN'T LEAVE ME MUCH,

894
00:52:05,157 --> 00:52:07,624
BUT I DON'T MIND
LOOKING AT IT.

895
00:52:07,659 --> 00:52:10,127
IT LEAVES YOU ME,
LUTIE.

896
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,146
COME IN.

897
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,152
COME IN, BRICE.

898
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,657
THE ST. LOUIS TRAIN
LEAVES IN HALF AN HOUR.

899
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,659
I KNOW.

900
00:52:42,694 --> 00:52:46,163
I HAVE A LITTLE MORE
PACKING TO DO.

901
00:52:46,198 --> 00:52:49,166
WHEN PEOPLE PACK,
THEY'RE GOING SOMEWHERE.

902
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,169
WHEN THEY'RE GOING SOMEWHERE,
IT'S BETTER TO KNOW WHERE.

903
00:52:52,204 --> 00:52:53,670
WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN, BRICE?

904
00:52:53,705 --> 00:52:55,672
I MEAN, WHAT'S IT
GOING TO BE, LUTIE?

905
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,674
I'LL GIVE YOU TIME.
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU.

906
00:52:57,709 --> 00:52:59,176
I'LL STAND BACK UNTIL YOU SEND
FOR ME

907
00:52:59,211 --> 00:53:01,678
OR I'LL TAKE THAT TRAIN
TO ST. LOUIS WITH YOU.

908
00:53:01,713 --> 00:53:03,180
IT WILL BE WHAT YOU WANT,
LUTIE, WHATEVER IT IS.

909
00:53:03,215 --> 00:53:06,183
IT WILL BE YOUR WAY,
ALL THE WAY.

910
00:53:06,218 --> 00:53:08,685
BRICE...

911
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,188
I'M SO ASHAMED...

912
00:53:11,223 --> 00:53:14,191
AND SO SORRY.

913
00:53:14,226 --> 00:53:18,195
ASHAMED FOR ME,
SORRY FOR YOU.

914
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,696
AND JIM.

915
00:53:19,731 --> 00:53:21,198
BREWTON'S ALL RIGHT.

916
00:53:21,233 --> 00:53:23,700
HE'S GOT YOU NOW
AS HE NEVER HAD YOU BEFORE.

917
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,202
NO, BRICE.

918
00:53:25,237 --> 00:53:26,703
YOU'RE HANGING ON TO YOURSELF
RIGHT NOW

919
00:53:26,738 --> 00:53:28,205
TO KEEP FROM RUNNING BACK TO HIM.

920
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,206
NO, BRICE.

921
00:53:29,241 --> 00:53:30,207
AND YOU'RE GOING.
- NO.

922
00:53:30,242 --> 00:53:33,210
YES, YOU ARE. NOTHING ON EARTH
CAN STOP YOU.

923
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,212
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

924
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:40,217
I KNOW HE WON'T CHANGE.

925
00:53:40,252 --> 00:53:43,220
I KNOW I'LL GO HATING
WHAT HE DOES.

926
00:53:43,255 --> 00:53:45,222
AND IT WILL
ALWAYS HURT ME.

927
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:48,725
BUT NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES
OR WHAT I THINK...

928
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,228
NO MATTER WHERE I GO...

929
00:53:51,263 --> 00:53:56,233
I'LL KEEP FEELING THAT MOST OF ME
IS THERE WITH HIM.

930
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,739
IT MEANS THAT YOU LOVE HIM.

931
00:54:02,774 --> 00:54:04,241
YES.

932
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:09,746
AND IF I DO,

933
00:54:09,781 --> 00:54:13,250
THEN I'VE GOT
TO BELIEVE IN HIM...

934
00:54:13,285 --> 00:54:15,252
AND GO ALONG WITH HIM.

935
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:21,258
I'LL GO BACK. TELL HIM
WHAT I'VE DONE...

936
00:54:21,293 --> 00:54:24,261
IF I HAVE THE COURAGE.

937
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,764
I'M SORRY FOR YOU, LUTIE.

938
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:57,294
I GOT A BIG FIRE IN THE LIVING ROOM,
MRS. BREWTON.

939
00:54:57,329 --> 00:54:58,795
THANK YOU, JEFF.

940
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:00,797
HAS SARAH BETH BEEN ALL RIGHT?

941
00:55:00,832 --> 00:55:02,299
SHE'S FINER THAN THAN FUZZ.

942
00:55:02,334 --> 00:55:05,302
I GOT A REAL NICE FIRE
DOWNSTAIRS.

943
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,806
ALL RIGHT, JEFF.

944
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,830
COLONEL TRADED JOE NETHERWOOD
OUT OF IT.

945
00:55:33,865 --> 00:55:36,333
IT'S THE ONLY PIANO IN
THE TERRITORY.

946
00:55:36,368 --> 00:55:37,834
GAVE HIM HIS BEST WHITEFACE BULL.

947
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,339
GOOD FIRE, AIN'T IT?

948
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,341
YES, JEFF.

949
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,868
THANK YOU, JIM.

950
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,870
JUST A FOOL IDEA I HAD.

951
00:56:13,905 --> 00:56:16,373
KIND OF LIKE
HAVING YOU AROUND.

952
00:56:16,408 --> 00:56:17,874
PLAY ME A TUNE, LUTIE.

953
00:56:17,909 --> 00:56:19,876
SAD MUSIC
OR HAPPY MUSIC?

954
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:25,382
UP TO YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF TUNE
YOU'VE GOT IN YOUR HEAD.

955
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,890
LIKE IT?

956
00:56:33,925 --> 00:56:37,394
PRETTY. KIND OF
A SURPRISE, THOUGH.

957
00:56:37,429 --> 00:56:38,895
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SAD.

958
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:41,898
IT WAS SAD WHEN
YOU WENT AWAY.

959
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,902
COME HERE, JIM.

960
00:56:45,937 --> 00:56:48,905
STAND BEHIND ME.

961
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,412
JIM, WHEN I WENT AWAY,
I DIDN'T INTEND TO COME BACK

962
00:56:55,447 --> 00:56:57,414
EXCEPT TO GET SARAH BETH.

963
00:56:57,449 --> 00:57:01,418
I WAS GOING TO ST. LOUIS.

964
00:57:01,453 --> 00:57:04,421
I FELT IT WAS STILL MY TOWN,
THAT I WOULD BE RIGHT THERE.

965
00:57:04,456 --> 00:57:07,924
YEAH. TREES
IN ST. LOUIS.

966
00:57:07,959 --> 00:57:11,428
YES, TREES YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLANT
AND CHERISH AND PROTECT.

967
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,433
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU EVER NOTICED.

968
00:57:16,468 --> 00:57:19,436
WHY DID YOU PLANT
THEM, LUTIE?

969
00:57:19,471 --> 00:57:21,938
WERE THEY TO SHUT SOMETHING OUT
OR TO SHUT YOURSELF IN?

970
00:57:22,974 --> 00:57:27,444
JIM, I WAS JEALOUS-

971
00:57:27,479 --> 00:57:29,946
PLAIN MEAN JEALOUS
OF THIS COUNTRY AND THE GRASS,

972
00:57:29,981 --> 00:57:32,449
AND I TRIED TO FIGHT IT.

973
00:57:32,484 --> 00:57:34,951
YES, WITH THE TREES AND
WITH SELINA AND SAM

974
00:57:34,986 --> 00:57:36,453
AND WITH A LOT
THINGS.

975
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:41,458
I WON'T FIGHT IT
ANYMORE, JIM.

976
00:57:42,994 --> 00:57:47,964
I'LL KNOW THAT IT'S THERE,
AND I WON'T CRY ABOUT IT.

977
00:57:47,999 --> 00:57:51,391
AND I WON'T
SAY BITTER THINGS,

978
00:57:51,392 --> 00:57:53,470
AND I WON'T RUN AWAY.

979
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:59,976
I... I'M BACK, JIM,
IF YOU'LL HAVE ME.

980
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:04,481
I'LL HAVE YOU, LUTIE.

981
00:58:04,516 --> 00:58:07,984
JIM, DON'T YOU WANT TO ASK ME
HOW DENVER WAS?

982
00:58:08,019 --> 00:58:11,488
AH. DENVER'S ALWAYS
DENVER.

983
00:58:11,523 --> 00:58:12,989
BUT, JIM...

984
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,996
I'LL MAKE IT
UP TO YOU, JIM.

985
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:25,001
WHAT IS THERE TO MAKE UP?
YOU'RE HERE.

986
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:34,511
THERE'S REALLY NO REASON
TO WORRY, LUTIE.

987
00:58:34,546 --> 00:58:37,514
JUST DO THE WAY YOU DID
WITH SARAH BETH.

988
00:58:37,549 --> 00:58:40,016
I'LL GO TELL
JIM YOU'RE FINE.

989
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,519
YES, DOC, I'M FINE.

990
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:09,546
WHEN DO YOU KNOW
WHEN IT'S TUNED?

991
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,047
I JUST KNOW.

992
00:59:13,585 --> 00:59:15,051
DOC, WHAT'S HOLDING UP
SCIENCE?

993
00:59:15,086 --> 00:59:16,553
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO BE
ABLE TO TELL A MAN

994
00:59:16,588 --> 00:59:18,054
WHETHER IT'S A BOY OR A GIRL?

995
00:59:18,089 --> 00:59:19,556
WHAT DO YOU WANT, JIM?

996
00:59:19,591 --> 00:59:22,058
WELL, WE GOT A GIRL.
COME ON! CHEER UP, DOC.

997
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:48,585
JIM, YOU'VE GOT TO REALIZE
LUTIE'S OUT OF HER HEAD,

998
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:51,588
BOUND TO SAY THINGS
WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND.

999
00:59:51,623 --> 00:59:54,591
JUST-JUST DON'T
THINK ABOUT IT.

1000
00:59:54,626 --> 00:59:58,595
GO ON DOWNSTAIRS AND LET
JEFF GET YOU A CUP OF COFFEE.

1001
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:00,597
OH, JEFF POUR HIM A CUP
OF COFFEE.

1002
01:00:00,632 --> 01:00:01,598
I GOT A POT
ON THE STOVE.

1003
01:00:01,633 --> 01:00:03,099
AND ME, TOO.

1004
01:00:03,134 --> 01:00:04,601
YOU'D BETTER
COME IN, DOCTOR.

1005
01:00:04,636 --> 01:00:05,602
SHE'S QUIT THAT WILD
TALK AND

1006
01:00:05,637 --> 01:00:07,103
I THINK THE BABY
IS GETTING CLOSE.

1007
01:00:07,138 --> 01:00:09,606
I NEVER HEARD
SUCH CARRYINGS-ON.

1008
01:00:09,641 --> 01:00:11,107
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT SHE SAID-

1009
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:16,613
MRS. RYAN, NONE OF US HEARD ANYTHING
IN THAT ROOM WORTH REPEATING.

1010
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,616
OF COURSE NOT.
CERTAINLY NOT.

1011
01:00:19,651 --> 01:00:21,618
I HOPE YOU REMEMEBER
THAT, MRS. RYAN.

1012
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,137
WELL, LUTIE,
WE'VE GOT A SON.

1013
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,146
MACK, WANT TO HAVE A SMOKE?

1014
01:00:50,181 --> 01:00:52,148
THANKS, JIM. ONLY GET THESE
WHEN I COME HERE.

1015
01:00:52,183 --> 01:00:53,149
DOC?

1016
01:00:53,184 --> 01:00:54,651
NO THANKS, JIM.

1017
01:00:54,686 --> 01:00:56,152
MRS. McCURTIN WAS SAYING
ONLY YESTERDAY, LUTIE,

1018
01:00:56,187 --> 01:00:58,655
BEFORE BROCK WAS BORN
WE USED TO SEE A LOT OF YOU IN TOWN.

1019
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:00,657
THE PAST YEAR OR SO,
YOU'VE BEEN HOLING UP ON US.

1020
01:01:00,692 --> 01:01:01,695
SHE SPENDS TOO MUCH TIME

1021
01:01:01,696 --> 01:01:03,660
WITH THEM CHILDREN,
SHE'S BOUND TO SPOIL THEM.

1022
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,662
SURE BOTH BABIES GOT OVER
THE CROUP RIGHT?

1023
01:01:05,697 --> 01:01:07,163
THEY GOT OVER IT ALL RIGHT,

1024
01:01:07,198 --> 01:01:10,166
NOT ON ACCOUNT OF THAT
MEDICINE YOU GAVE THEM.

1025
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:11,668
YOU GOING TO TAKE THIS OR
AREN'T YOU?

1026
01:01:11,703 --> 01:01:13,670
THAT SO, JEFF?
WHAT CURED THEM?

1027
01:01:13,705 --> 01:01:15,672
BAKING SODA,
AND LOTS OF IT.

1028
01:01:15,707 --> 01:01:20,176
CURE ANY KIND OF A COLD.
DOCTORS!

1029
01:01:20,211 --> 01:01:22,679
WE GAVE THEM YOUR MEDICINE
BEHIND JEFF'S BACK.

1030
01:01:22,714 --> 01:01:24,180
DON'T EVER LET HIM
KNOW ABOUT IT, THOUGH.

1031
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,686
WELL, COME ON, MACK,
LET'S HAVE IT.

1032
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,188
WHAT?

1033
01:01:32,223 --> 01:01:33,189
THE BAD NEWS.

1034
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,691
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

1035
01:01:34,726 --> 01:01:37,694
ALL OVER YOU
EVER SINCE YOU GOT HERE.

1036
01:01:37,729 --> 01:01:40,196
I'VE GOT A HUNCH CHAMBERLAIN'S
UP TO SOMETHING.

1037
01:01:40,231 --> 01:01:41,698
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

1038
01:01:41,733 --> 01:01:43,700
ALL OVER HIM THE LAST TIME
I SAW HIM.

1039
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:48,204
AND YOU'RE RIGHT, JIM.
HE'S UP TO PLENTY.

1040
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:49,706
I'LL LEAVE YOU TO YOUR BUSINESS
AND YOUR BRANDY.

1041
01:01:49,741 --> 01:01:52,195
NO, NO, SIT DOWN. MACK'S A LAWYER.

1042
01:01:52,196 --> 01:01:53,710
HE LIKES AN AUDIENCE.

1043
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:07,223
CHAMBERLAIN'S GOT SALT FORK
MADE A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT.

1044
01:02:07,258 --> 01:02:09,726
GOT HIMSELF ELECTED JUDGE.

1045
01:02:09,761 --> 01:02:11,227
WHAT ABOUT JUDGE WHITE?

1046
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,229
ONLY LOCAL MATTERS NOW.

1047
01:02:13,264 --> 01:02:15,231
OH, IS THAT SO?

1048
01:02:15,266 --> 01:02:17,734
AND HERES CHAMBERLAIN'S
MESSAGE TO YOU, JIM.

1049
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,236
TOMORROW HE'S SENDING NOTICE TO
EVERY SQUATTER IN TOWN

1050
01:02:20,271 --> 01:02:21,738
AND THERE'S A WHOLE
THE WAGON TRAIN OF 'EM-

1051
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,740
THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S
REPRESENTED HERE NOW

1052
01:02:23,775 --> 01:02:25,241
AND WILL THEM
FULL PROTECTION.

1053
01:02:25,276 --> 01:02:28,745
YOU'LL HAVE A HUNDRED CLAIMS ON
YOUR RANGE BEFORE THE WEEK IS OUT.

1054
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:30,246
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE OUGHT TO DO, MACK?

1055
01:02:30,281 --> 01:02:31,916
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR A CHANCE-

1056
01:02:31,917 --> 01:02:33,750
ANY CHANCE OF ANY
KIND- TO HEAD IT OFF

1057
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,251
BUT THERE ISN'T ANY.

1058
01:02:35,286 --> 01:02:36,753
IT'S THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT NOW,

1059
01:02:36,788 --> 01:02:38,626
THE LAW OF THE LAND,
AND IT'S OBEYED.

1060
01:02:38,627 --> 01:02:40,818
IT'S GOT TO BE.

1061
01:02:40,819 --> 01:02:44,761
WHAT DO YOU THINK, LUTIE?

1062
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:51,261
I? WELL, I THINK
MACK HAS SAID IT, JIM.

1063
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:57,774
IT HAD TO HAPPEN, JIM.
EVERYONE KNEW IT.

1064
01:02:57,809 --> 01:02:59,776
I THINK YOU DID
IN YOUR HEART.

1065
01:02:59,811 --> 01:03:01,778
NO.

1066
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,282
NO, I DIDN'T, LUTIE.

1067
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,791
WELL!

1068
01:03:14,826 --> 01:03:16,292
GOOD.

1069
01:03:16,327 --> 01:03:17,794
GOOD NIGHT DEAR.

1070
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:19,796
HOW IS YOUR FINGER
WHERE YOU CUT IT?

1071
01:03:19,831 --> 01:03:20,797
YOU TOLD ME
IT WOULDN'T HURT.

1072
01:03:20,832 --> 01:03:22,298
WELL, IT WON'T HURT, EITHER.

1073
01:03:22,333 --> 01:03:24,300
ANYTHING YOU SAY
GOES, HUH, JIM?

1074
01:03:24,335 --> 01:03:26,302
SURE. SHE'S JIM'S GIRL.
HER FIRST CRUSH.

1075
01:03:26,337 --> 01:03:27,804
COME, SARAH BETH.

1076
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:28,805
GOOD NIGHT, DEAR.

1077
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,306
GOOD NIGHT.

1078
01:03:30,341 --> 01:03:31,307
GOOD NIGHT, LUTIE.
VERY NICE DINNER.

1079
01:03:31,342 --> 01:03:32,308
THANK YOU.

1080
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,310
GOOD NIGHT, LUTIE.

1081
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,313
GOOD NIGHT, JIM.

1082
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,318
GOOD NIGHT, DEAR.

1083
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,328
DON'T GET LUTIE
WRONG, JIM.

1084
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,831
SHE'S A WOMAN,
AND, WELL..

1085
01:03:54,866 --> 01:03:57,834
I DON'T GET HER
WRONG, DOC.

1086
01:03:57,869 --> 01:04:01,337
IT'S JUST THAT I KEEP
WISHING SHE WAS REALLY ON MY SIDE.

1087
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,842
WELL, HELP YOURSELVES,
GENTLEMEN.

1088
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:09,345
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO, JIM?

1089
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:12,348
RIGHT NOW? GOING FOR
A LITTLE WALK.

1090
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:17,353
IS THAT COLD?

1091
01:04:17,388 --> 01:04:20,857
BANTY,
BRING JOE.

1092
01:04:21,893 --> 01:04:22,859
HOLD HER A MINUTE.

1093
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,362
CAN I GO UNDER THERE?

1094
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:32,869
ANDY, YOU TAKE THE DAVIS PLACE
AND MCGEE'S RANCH.

1095
01:04:32,904 --> 01:04:34,370
TELL THEM I WANTS TO SEE THEM.

1096
01:04:34,405 --> 01:04:36,372
TELL THEM IT WON'T HURT
TO BRING THEIR WINCHESTERS.

1097
01:04:36,407 --> 01:04:38,374
WAKE, YOU TAKE VALEZ'S RANCH AND
THE OUTFIT SOUTH.

1098
01:04:38,409 --> 01:04:39,876
YOU BET, COLONEL.

1099
01:04:39,911 --> 01:04:40,877
GET GOING.

1100
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,884
YOU WERE GOING
TO PUT ME TO BED.

1101
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,887
YES, DARLING. I'LL COME RIGHT
BACK AND PUT YOU TO BED.

1102
01:04:50,922 --> 01:04:52,388
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1103
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,912
I COULD CRY FOR YOU, JIM

1104
01:05:15,947 --> 01:05:17,413
DON'T WASTE IT
ON ME, LUTIE.

1105
01:05:17,448 --> 01:05:18,915
WHY DON'T YOU GO UP AND TRY TO
GET SOME SLEEP?

1106
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:20,917
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT I NEED.

1107
01:05:20,952 --> 01:05:22,418
WHY DO YOU KEEP
LOOKING AT ME?

1108
01:05:22,453 --> 01:05:24,420
WHAT DO YOU KEEP
WANTING OF ME?

1109
01:05:24,455 --> 01:05:27,423
NOTHING, LUTIE. NOTHING ANYMORE.
I DON'T EXPECT IT.

1110
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,427
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO, JIM?

1111
01:05:31,462 --> 01:05:33,429
IF CHAMBERLAIN WANTS TO DECLARE WAR,
HE'S GOING TO GET IT.

1112
01:05:33,464 --> 01:05:34,931
YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO GO OUT
AND SHOOT

1113
01:05:34,966 --> 01:05:36,432
THE FIRST HOMESTEADERS THAT
COME OVER?

1114
01:05:36,467 --> 01:05:37,934
THAT'S RIGHT.

1115
01:05:37,969 --> 01:05:38,935
IN COLD BLOOD?

1116
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:40,436
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT TO CALL IT.

1117
01:05:40,471 --> 01:05:41,437
DON'T DO IT, JIM.
GIVE UP ON IT.

1118
01:05:41,472 --> 01:05:42,438
WHO ARE YOU
PROTECTING?

1119
01:05:42,473 --> 01:05:43,940
YOU, JIM. YOU.

1120
01:05:43,975 --> 01:05:45,441
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
WHY DO YOU WANT ME TO LOSE?

1121
01:05:45,476 --> 01:05:46,943
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

1122
01:05:46,978 --> 01:05:48,945
BUT YOU DO, DON'T YOU?

1123
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:50,446
WELL, I-I GUESS SO.
MAYBE I DO.

1124
01:05:50,481 --> 01:05:51,948
WHY? WHY?

1125
01:05:51,983 --> 01:05:53,449
I... I... MAYBE THEN
I'D HAVE A CHANCE.

1126
01:05:53,484 --> 01:05:54,951
MAYBE YOU'D TURN
TO ME-TO ME ALONE.

1127
01:05:54,986 --> 01:05:56,452
IS THAT THE ONLY REASON?

1128
01:05:56,487 --> 01:05:57,954
JIM, IT'S MURDER,
KILLING PEOPLE.

1129
01:05:57,989 --> 01:05:59,455
I DON'T KNOW
IF I COULD BEAR IT.

1130
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:02,458
I... I'VE TRIED TO FIT IN, I'VE TRIED TO
BE WHAT YOU WANT, BUT...

1131
01:06:02,493 --> 01:06:03,960
YOU HAVE DONE THAT.
I'VE SEEN YOU TRYING.

1132
01:06:03,995 --> 01:06:05,461
BUT TO GO OUT
IN COLD BLOOD...

1133
01:06:05,496 --> 01:06:07,463
BUT I'VE SEEN OTHER THINGS I'VE SAID
NOTHING ABOUT.

1134
01:06:07,498 --> 01:06:09,465
THEY'RE INNOCENT PEOPLE, JIM.

1135
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,968
I'M GOING TO DO
WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

1136
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:16,973
ALL RIGHT, JIM.

1137
01:06:17,008 --> 01:06:18,474
ALL RIGHT, WHAT?

1138
01:06:18,509 --> 01:06:19,976
DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
I'VE NOTHING MORE TO SAY.

1139
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:21,477
AND WHAT WILL YOU DO?

1140
01:06:21,512 --> 01:06:23,980
NOTHING. I'LL WAIT.

1141
01:06:24,015 --> 01:06:26,482
NOTHING MORE TO SAY?

1142
01:06:26,517 --> 01:06:27,483
NO.

1143
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:32,989
YOU'D GO ON LIVING WITH A MURDERER,
LUTIE? WHY?

1144
01:06:33,024 --> 01:06:34,991
WHY DO YOU OWE ME THAT?
THAT'S A LOT.

1145
01:06:35,026 --> 01:06:36,993
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT ONCE.
YOU'VE CHANGED/

1146
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:40,496
WHAT CHANGED YOU?
WHY DO YOU OWE ME SO MUCH?

1147
01:06:40,531 --> 01:06:42,498
THE TRIP TO DENVER, MAYBE?

1148
01:06:42,533 --> 01:06:47,503
YOU NEVER REALLY TOLD ME
WHY YOU CAME BACK HERE.

1149
01:06:47,538 --> 01:06:49,505
DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME
NOW, LUTIE?

1150
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,012
NOTHING MORE TO DAY.

1151
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:02,018
WELL, I GUESS THAT
SAYS IT ALL.

1152
01:07:02,053 --> 01:07:05,021
IT TOOK A LONG TIME
BUT IT'S ALL SET NOW.

1153
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:13,030
I TRIED, JIM. I TRIED.

1154
01:07:13,465 --> 01:07:16,032
MORE THAN ONCE.
BUT YOU JUST LOOKED AT ME.

1155
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:21,037
YOU JUST LOOKED AT ME
AND STOPPED ME.

1156
01:07:21,072 --> 01:07:25,541
I COULDN'T. I COULDN'T.

1157
01:07:25,576 --> 01:07:27,543
BUT NOW I'M GLAD
IT'S OUT IN THE OPEN.

1158
01:07:27,578 --> 01:07:30,046
I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS.

1159
01:07:30,081 --> 01:07:34,050
I'M GLAD IT'S OUT
AFTER 2 YEARS. I'M GLAD IT'S OUT.

1160
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:45,561
WHEN DO YOU WANT TO LEAVE, LUTIE?

1161
01:07:45,596 --> 01:07:48,064
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.

1162
01:07:48,099 --> 01:07:50,066
THEN WHEN ARE YOU
GOINGTO LEAVE?

1163
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,569
YOU CAN CATCH THE NEXT TRAIN.

1164
01:07:53,604 --> 01:07:57,073
YOU'D BETTER GO UP AND PACK.
WE'LL START IN THE MORNING.

1165
01:07:57,108 --> 01:08:02,078
I DON'T SEE HOW,
WITH ALL THE CHILDREN'S THINGS.

1166
01:08:02,113 --> 01:08:05,581
THE CHILDREN'S THINGS?
YOU WON'T HAVE TO PACK THOSE.

1167
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,084
YOU THINK I'D LEAVE THEM HERE?

1168
01:08:08,119 --> 01:08:09,585
I'M SURE OF IT.

1169
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:10,586
I COULDN'T LEAVE THEM.

1170
01:08:10,621 --> 01:08:11,587
YOU CAN TAKE
ONE OF THEM, LUTIE.

1171
01:08:11,622 --> 01:08:12,588
ONE?

1172
01:08:12,623 --> 01:08:14,090
YOU CAN TAKE BROCK.

1173
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:15,591
BUT IF YOU TAKE HIM

1174
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,593
YOU TAKE EVERYTHING THAT GOES WITH IT,

1175
01:08:17,628 --> 01:08:19,595
AND SO DOES HE.

1176
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,876
IF YOU LEAVE HIM

1177
01:08:21,877 --> 01:08:26,102
I'LL BRING HIM UP, AND I'LL DO FOR HIM.

1178
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,107
A MAN WANTS A SON.

1179
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,118
ALL RIGHT, JIM.

1180
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,622
I THOUGHT YOU'D
SEE IT MY WAY.

1181
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:53,629
BUT I... I WON'T LET YOU KEEP
THEM FOREVER. I'LL FIGHT.

1182
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,132
THAT'S ONE FIGHT
I WOULDN'T LOSE, LUTIE.

1183
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:01,137
YOU STILL CARRY HIM
IN YOUR HEART. DON'T YOU?

1184
01:09:01,172 --> 01:09:03,639
I CARRY YOU
IN MY HEART, JIM

1185
01:09:03,674 --> 01:09:06,642
I LOVE YOU. CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?
I LOVE YOU.

1186
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:10,146
YOU COULDN'T LOVE ME
AND BE AGAINST ME.

1187
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,656
YOU'LL BOTH HAVE TO BE
VERY GOOD FOR JEFF.

1188
01:09:20,691 --> 01:09:24,660
AND SARAH BETH, DARLING.
YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF BRCK, WON'T YOU?

1189
01:09:24,695 --> 01:09:28,164
OH, DARLING, YOU'RE SO LITTLE.
YOU WON'T REMEMBER, YOU CAN'T.

1190
01:09:28,199 --> 01:09:30,666
I'LL REMEMBER.

1191
01:09:30,701 --> 01:09:32,168
THE COLONEL'S READY NOW, MRS. BREWTON.

1192
01:09:32,203 --> 01:09:34,670
CAN I GO FOR A RIDE TOO,
TOO, MAMA?

1193
01:09:34,705 --> 01:09:36,672
NOT TODAY, DARLING.

1194
01:09:36,707 --> 01:09:39,675
REMEMBER, I'LL BE BACK
SOONER THAN SOON,

1195
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:41,677
WITH A DOUBLE
PRESENT FOR BOTH.

1196
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:08,204
GOOD-BYE, JEFF.
YOU'VE BEEN A FRIEND.

1197
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:10,206
DON'T YOU WORRY,
MRS. BREWTON.

1198
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:16,212
SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT ME
TO MY CHILDREN, JEFF.

1199
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,222
GOODBYE.

1200
01:10:26,257 --> 01:10:27,223
GOODBYE, DOC.

1201
01:10:27,258 --> 01:10:28,724
YOU BE GOOD.

1202
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,731
READY?

1203
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:51,747
DOC GAVE ME THIS
CHECK FROM YOU.

1204
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,250
ALL ABOARD!

1205
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:58,754
IS THIS THE WAY
WE SAY GOODBYE?

1206
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:04,760
YOU SAID GOOD-BYE, LUTIE.
TWO YEARS AGO.

1207
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:28,784
HE'S JUST TURNING
IN THE DOOR.

1208
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,795
COME IN, JIM. GLAD YOU COULD
MAKE IT.

1209
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:47,303
WHAT DID YOU GET ME
HERE FOR, DOC?

1210
01:11:47,338 --> 01:11:48,804
WELL, JIM, I GOT A FUNNY FEELING

1211
01:11:48,839 --> 01:11:50,806
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE GOING
TO BE KILLED.

1212
01:11:50,841 --> 01:11:52,308
BUT YOU TWO
CAN STOP IT.

1213
01:11:52,343 --> 01:11:53,387
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, DOC.

1214
01:11:53,388 --> 01:11:55,028
THE LAW'S GOING TO BE
ENFORCED. THAT'S ALL.

1215
01:11:57,029 --> 01:11:58,129
I'LL SEE YOU LATER DOC.

1216
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:04,820
DON'T BE A FOOL, BREWTON.
GO AFTER HER.

1217
01:12:04,855 --> 01:12:08,324
I NEVER HAD A CHANCE.
I TRIED.

1218
01:12:08,359 --> 01:12:11,327
I TRIED IN DENVER
AND AGAIN YESTERDAY BEFORE SHE LEFT.

1219
01:12:11,362 --> 01:12:15,331
YOU WERE IN THE WAY.
YOU STILL ARE.

1220
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:24,840
HI, COLONEL!
WE'RE ALL SET.

1221
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,849
EVERYBODY'S ALL HERE, COLONEL-EVERY
COWMAN WHO COULD SET A HORSE.

1222
01:12:33,884 --> 01:12:34,606
THERE'S MORE AMMUNITION.

1223
01:12:34,607 --> 01:12:36,352
TELL THEM TO HELP THEMSELVES.
I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE.

1224
01:12:36,387 --> 01:12:39,355
RIGHT. HERE'S MORE AMMUNITION,
BOYS. COME AND GET IT!

1225
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:41,357
COME AND GET IT, BOYS!

1226
01:12:41,392 --> 01:12:42,358
THERE'S MORE AMMUNITION HERE.

1227
01:12:42,393 --> 01:12:43,859
MORE AMMUNITION HERE...

1228
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:40,416
PHELPS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE, PRACTICE MARCH?

1229
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:42,418
NO, I WISH IT WERE.

1230
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:44,420
I'M HERE TO SEE THAT THE
HOMESTEADERS ARE LET ALONE.

1231
01:13:44,455 --> 01:13:45,921
OH?

1232
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:47,680
NOW, DON'T LOOK AT ME
LIKE THAT, JIM.

1233
01:13:47,681 --> 01:13:48,454
I'M A COWMAN MYSELF.

1234
01:13:48,459 --> 01:13:50,928
I SETTLED OUT HERE
THE SAME TIME YOU DID.

1235
01:13:50,929 --> 01:13:51,927
I DON'T LIKE THIS.

1236
01:13:51,962 --> 01:13:54,430
BUT MY ORDERS COME FROM
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

1237
01:13:54,465 --> 01:13:56,932
AND THEY SAY TO KEEP
THE PEACE OUT HERE.

1238
01:13:56,967 --> 01:13:58,434
SO I GUESS I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO TRY.

1239
01:13:58,469 --> 01:13:59,935
THAT SO?

1240
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:03,939
THE MEN I'VE GOT ARE GOOD MEN.
THEY'LL DO AS THEIR ORDERS READ.

1241
01:14:03,974 --> 01:14:04,940
A LOT OF THEM MAY DIE.

1242
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:06,942
YOU'VE GOT GOOD MEN, TOO.

1243
01:14:06,977 --> 01:14:09,945
LOOKS AS THOUGH
YOU OUTNUMBER US.

1244
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:11,447
SO YOU'D PROBABLY
WIN TODAY.

1245
01:14:11,482 --> 01:14:13,449
BUT NOTHING WOULD STAY WON.

1246
01:14:13,484 --> 01:14:15,174
THEY'D SEND A REGIMENT OUT HERE

1247
01:14:15,175 --> 01:14:17,953
IF IT WAS NECESSARY AND
ALL YOUR MEN WOULD BE DEAD.

1248
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:22,458
NOT ONLY YOU-YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT
TO DECIDE THAT YOURSELF-BUT THEM TOO.

1249
01:14:22,493 --> 01:14:25,961
AS I SAID BEFORE, JIM.
THEY'RE GOOD MEN.

1250
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,972
THEY'RE REAL GOOD MEN.

1251
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,483
WELL, BOYS, I'M AFRAID
WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIGHT,

1252
01:14:47,518 --> 01:14:50,486
UNLESS SOMEBODY FEELS
DIFFERENT ABOUT IT.

1253
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:55,991
SO, I GUESS WE'LL JUST GO ON HOME.

1254
01:14:56,026 --> 01:14:58,494
MAYBE ONE OF THESE DAYS
WE'LL BE SORRY WE DID.

1255
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,998
THEY CAN KEEP THE NESTOR FROM
BEING BLOWN AWAY

1256
01:15:03,033 --> 01:15:06,502
BUT ONLY
GOD CAN HELP THE PRAIRIE.

1257
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:30,526
NOW, UM, UH, LET ME UNDERSTAND
THIS CLEARLY, MR. CRANE.

1258
01:15:30,561 --> 01:15:34,029
UH, YOU BELIEVE THAT I MAY BE
ABLE TO GAIN CUSTODY OF MY SON

1259
01:15:34,064 --> 01:15:36,818
BUT TO DO THIS, I MUST
ESTABLISH IN THE COURT

1260
01:15:36,819 --> 01:15:39,034
UNDER OATH THE IDENTITY OF HIS FATHER?

1261
01:15:39,069 --> 01:15:42,538
IN ORDER TO HAVE HIM
LEGALLY, IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

1262
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:47,543
AND-AND IT IS ALSO YOUR OPINION
THAT IF I DO PROVE MY RIGHT TO HIM

1263
01:15:47,578 --> 01:15:50,045
I MAY FORFEIT MY RIGHT
TO MY DAUGHTER?

1264
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:53,549
I'M AFRAID THAT'S
THE SIZE OF IT, LUTIE.

1265
01:15:53,584 --> 01:15:55,023
YOU WOULD, IN THE EYES

1266
01:15:55,024 --> 01:15:58,554
OF THE COURT, FOREVER PROVE
YOUR UNFITNESS TO HAVE HER.

1267
01:15:58,589 --> 01:16:01,056
BUT WITH LUCK,
YOU COULD HAVE BROCK.

1268
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:09,565
YES, WITH LUCK, I'D
SUCCEED IN BRANDING ONE,

1269
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,568
SEPARATING THEM
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.

1270
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,572
I'M SORRY, LUTIE.

1271
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,582
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS?

1272
01:16:26,617 --> 01:16:29,084
ARE YOU GOING TO STAY
IN ST. LOUIS, MY DEAR?

1273
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:31,587
WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
MR. CRANE.

1274
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:33,199
SINCE MY FATHER DIED

1275
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,591
I DON'T SEEM TO BELONG
HERE ANYMORE, EITHER.

1276
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:38,093
GOOD-BYE. THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

1277
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:44,600
WRITE TO ME, DOC.

1278
01:16:44,635 --> 01:16:47,603
LET ME KNOW ABOUT MY BABIES.
HOW THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY DO.

1279
01:16:47,638 --> 01:16:52,107
KEEP IN TOUCH WITH ME PLEASE.
LOVE, LUTIE.

1280
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,619
YOU ARE MISSED, LUTIE.

1281
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:07,839
IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY BLEW OUT
A LIGHT, AND IT'S A LITTLE

1282
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,124
DARKER FOR ALL OF US.

1283
01:17:09,159 --> 01:17:12,127
JIM HAD THE CHILDREN IN
THE OTHER DAY FOR ME TO LOOK OVER.

1284
01:17:12,162 --> 01:17:14,630
AND THEY'RE HEALTHY
AS GOATS.

1285
01:17:14,665 --> 01:17:17,132
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
SALT FORK, LUTIE.

1286
01:17:17,167 --> 01:17:19,107
THE TOWN'S JAM-PACKED EVERY DAY.

1287
01:17:19,108 --> 01:17:22,137
STOREKEEPERS ARE TRUCKING
TO THE HOMESTEADERS, NOW.

1288
01:17:22,172 --> 01:17:23,620
HARDLY EVER SEE A CATTLEMAN

1289
01:17:23,621 --> 01:17:26,141
ANYMORE, UNLESS IT'S
WHEN THEY COME IN TO FIGHT

1290
01:17:26,176 --> 01:17:28,442
AND LOSE ONE OF THE
LAWSUITS THAT'S ALWAYS BEING

1291
01:17:28,443 --> 01:17:29,645
SLAPPED ON THEM BY FARMERS.

1292
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,147
THE COURT THEREFORE
FIXES DAMAGES.

1293
01:17:32,182 --> 01:17:36,151
FOR THE FULL MARKET VALUE
OF THE MATURED CROP.

1294
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:45,661
CHAMBERLAIN WAS HEARD
TO SAY THAT GOD WAS

1295
01:17:45,696 --> 01:17:47,162
ON THE SIDE OF THE HOMESTEADERS.

1296
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,237
I DON'T KNOW AS I COULD SPEAK

1297
01:17:49,238 --> 01:17:52,167
FOR HIM BUT I'VE GOT TO
ADMIT THAT THE CROPS ARE GOOD.

1298
01:17:52,202 --> 01:17:53,354
THE HEADS ON THE WHEAT ARE

1299
01:17:53,355 --> 01:17:55,170
SO HEAVY, THEY'LL
KNOCK A MAN'S HEAD OFF.

1300
01:17:55,205 --> 01:17:59,675
AND THE CORN CAN SWALLOW UP
A HORSE AND RIDER.

1301
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:01,582
THIS IS RICH LAND, ALL RIGHT.

1302
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:04,680
AND THE SODBUSTERS ARE
REAPING ITS FIRST FLOWER.

1303
01:18:04,715 --> 01:18:08,684
MAYBE THAT WHAT GOD
ORDERED, I DON'T KNOW.

1304
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,185
YOU ASK ABOUT JIM.

1305
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:12,187
WELL, HE NEVER SAYS MUCH

1306
01:18:12,222 --> 01:18:14,021
BUT HIS BACK'S A LITTLE STRAIGHTER

1307
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:16,191
AND HIS HEAD'S A
LITTLE HIGHER THAN EVER.

1308
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:20,195
SARAH BETH FOLLOWS HER FATHER AROUND
LIKE SHE WAS A LONESOME PUP.

1309
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:24,666
I GOT TO ADMIT THAT JIM TREATS
HER ABOUT LIKE SHE WAS A PUP.

1310
01:18:24,667 --> 01:18:26,702
NOT THAT HE ISN'T GOOD TO HER.

1311
01:18:26,737 --> 01:18:31,206
I GUESS IT'S THIS WAY.
SARAH BETH GIVES ALL TO JIM.

1312
01:18:31,241 --> 01:18:33,208
AND HE GIVES IT ALL
TO BROCK.

1313
01:18:33,243 --> 01:18:36,712
AND BROCK... WELL, BROCK'S LIKE
HE ALWAYS WAS-

1314
01:18:36,747 --> 01:18:40,716
TEMPER LIKE A BUZZ SAW
AND A SMILE LIKE A FEATHERED ANGEL.

1315
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:55,731
OH DOC, I AM LONELY,

1316
01:18:55,766 --> 01:19:01,737
BUT I KNOW I SHOULD STAY AWAY, AND
I WILL JUST AS LONG AS I CAN.

1317
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:04,239
JUST AS LONG AS I CAN.

1318
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,251
DOC!

1319
01:19:16,286 --> 01:19:17,252
LUTIE! OH!

1320
01:19:17,287 --> 01:19:18,253
OH!

1321
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,256
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU.

1322
01:19:21,291 --> 01:19:22,758
RIG IS RIGHT OVER HERE.

1323
01:19:28,799 --> 01:19:31,266
IT'S ALL CHANGED.

1324
01:19:31,301 --> 01:19:33,268
YES...

1325
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:51,333
TELL ME, LUTIE, WHY DID YOU REALLY COME?

1326
01:19:51,334 --> 01:19:53,288
JUST TO SEE THE CHILDREN?

1327
01:19:53,323 --> 01:19:57,292
THAT MOSTLY. IT'S BEEN
PRETTY BAD, DOC.

1328
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,295
WHERE'S JIM?

1329
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:01,797
WAITING AT THE HOTEL.

1330
01:20:01,832 --> 01:20:03,298
WAITING?

1331
01:20:03,333 --> 01:20:05,300
TO TAKE THE CHILDREN HOME
AFTER YOU'VE SEEN THEM.

1332
01:20:05,335 --> 01:20:09,805
OH. DID HE MIND
ABOUT MY SEEING THEM?

1333
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:14,810
HE DIDN'T SAY ONE WAY
OR THE OTHER.

1334
01:20:14,845 --> 01:20:18,229
DOC... WHAT ABOUT JIM?

1335
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:24,230
WHERE I'M CONCERNED, I MEAN? TELL ME.

1336
01:20:24,354 --> 01:20:29,825
HONEY, IT'S PRETTY HARD TO SAY.

1337
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:34,329
HE'S JUST NEVER MENTIONED
YOUR NAME ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

1338
01:20:34,364 --> 01:20:36,331
THANK YOU.

1339
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:48,844
ALL RIGHT, MRS. SMITH.

1340
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:32,387
DOC... THEY DON'T KNOW ME.

1341
01:21:32,422 --> 01:21:33,709
THEY'RE VERY YOUNG.

1342
01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:36,892
IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS,
LUTIE. YOU CAN'T EXPECT IT.

1343
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:42,397
NO, I DON'T EXPECT IT.
I ONLY HOPED.

1344
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:48,403
DO YOU REMEMBER? I SAID I'D BRING
A DOUBLE PRESENT FOR BOTH OF YOU?

1345
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:50,405
DO YOU REMEMBER, SARAH BETH?

1346
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,908
NO.

1347
01:21:52,943 --> 01:21:54,910
BUT YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE A PRESENT,
WOULDN'T YOU?

1348
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:56,411
YES.

1349
01:21:56,446 --> 01:21:59,915
THEN YOU WAIT. AND LOOK AT
WHAT I HAVE IN MY BAG.

1350
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:01,917
NOW, YOU LOOK IN THE BAG.

1351
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,939
SAW HER OFF GETTING OFF THE TRAIN
AS BIG AS LIFE.

1352
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:25,440
WENT RIGHT OVER TO DOC REID'S.

1353
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:53,468
YOU MUST LEAVE
AT ONCE, BRICE.

1354
01:22:53,503 --> 01:22:55,470
DO YOU REALIZE I'VE NEVER EVEN
TOUCHED HIM BEFORE.

1355
01:22:55,505 --> 01:22:59,975
NEVER BEEN CLOSE ENOUGH TO LOOK
INTO HIS EYES. HE'S A FINE BOY.

1356
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:01,476
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE COME HERE.

1357
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:13,688
BROCK.

1358
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:27,202
JIM.

1359
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:36,011
COME ON, KIDS.
TIME TO GO NOW.

1360
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:41,516
I'M SORRY, LUTIE.

1361
01:23:57,532 --> 01:24:00,035
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
COME BACK.

1362
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:04,039
I'VE BROUGHT EVERYTHING
TO LIFE AGAIN.

1363
01:24:04,074 --> 01:24:06,541
AND THE CHILDREN, BRICE,
THEY DON'T KNOW ME.

1364
01:24:06,576 --> 01:24:08,543
I'M NOT SURE THEY EVEN
LIKE ME.

1365
01:24:08,578 --> 01:24:11,546
THEY WERE JUST WAITING
FOR THE TIME TO GO HOME.

1366
01:24:11,581 --> 01:24:14,549
THEY DON'T NEED ME. THEY DON'T
NEED ANYTHING FROM ME.

1367
01:24:14,584 --> 01:24:15,907
LISTEN TO ME, LUTIE.

1368
01:24:15,908 --> 01:24:18,553
YOU AND I, WE COULD
GET BROCK. HE'S OURS.

1369
01:24:18,588 --> 01:24:20,555
LET BREWTON HAVE
SARAH BETH.

1370
01:24:20,590 --> 01:24:24,059
WE COULD TAKE BROCK AWAY
HE BELONGS WITH YOU AND ME.

1371
01:24:24,094 --> 01:24:28,563
WE CAN GET AS FAR AWAY FROM HERE
AS TRAINS COULD CARRY US.

1372
01:24:28,598 --> 01:24:31,066
THIS IS OUR LAST
CHANCE, LUTIE.

1373
01:24:31,101 --> 01:24:33,068
THE LAST CHANCE
FOR THE 3 OF US.

1374
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:38,073
I CAN'T GO AWAY WITH YOU, BRICE.

1375
01:24:38,108 --> 01:24:41,576
I CAN'T HAVE BROCK.
AND I CAN'T HAVE SARAH BETH.

1376
01:24:41,611 --> 01:24:44,579
SO I'M GOING TO GO,
BUT I'LL GO ALONE.

1377
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:50,585
AND YOU'VE GOT
NOTHING FOR ME.

1378
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:57,592
NOT ENOUGH, BRICE.
NOT ENOUGH FOR THAT.

1379
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:05,660
COME ON IN.

1380
01:26:17,207 --> 01:26:18,673
DOC?

1381
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:23,178
GLAD MACK GOT
YOU HERE, JIM.

1382
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:25,680
HAVEN'T BEEN SEEING
VERY MUCH OF YOU LATELY.

1383
01:26:25,715 --> 01:26:27,682
I HAVEN'T BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

1384
01:26:27,717 --> 01:26:30,185
SO I NOTICED.

1385
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:36,191
I USED TO LOVE YOU
LIKE THE SON I NEVER HAD.

1386
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:39,694
NOT ANYMORE.
YOU KNOW WHY?

1387
01:26:39,729 --> 01:26:42,197
MAYBE YOU BETTER
NOT TALK ABOUT IT NOW, DOC.

1388
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:46,701
I GOT TO. I'LL TELL
YOU WHY-LUTIE.

1389
01:26:46,736 --> 01:26:51,206
I CAN SAY IT NOW-LUTIE.

1390
01:26:51,241 --> 01:26:56,211
YOU WOULDN'T LET ANYBODY
SPEAK HER NAME, WOULD YOU, JIM?

1391
01:26:56,246 --> 01:26:58,213
BUT YOU GOT TO HUMOR ME.

1392
01:26:58,248 --> 01:27:01,216
LAST WISH, YOU KNOW.

1393
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:08,223
ALL LUTIE NEEDED WAS...
WAS A LITTLE HELP... FROM YOU.

1394
01:27:08,258 --> 01:27:12,727
SHE HAD BETTER COMING
THAN SHE GOT.

1395
01:27:12,762 --> 01:27:16,731
SHE NEVER FORGOT HER CHILDREN.
SHE WAS ALL RIGHT.

1396
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:22,237
AND YOU SENT HER
AWAY TWICE. YOUR FAULT.

1397
01:27:22,272 --> 01:27:24,571
THAT'S RIGHT. YOURS.

1398
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:29,744
PEOPLE DON'T TELL YOU THAT
MUCH, DO THEY, JIM?

1399
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:35,250
JIM.

1400
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:40,255
JIM!

1401
01:27:43,758 --> 01:27:45,260
DO YOU HEAR ME?

1402
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:48,763
YES, DOC, I HEAR YOU.

1403
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:56,271
YOU'LL-YOU'LL NEVER CHANGE.

1404
01:27:58,773 --> 01:28:01,776
YOU'VE STILL GOT THAT SAME
LOOK IN YOUR EYES.

1405
01:28:05,815 --> 01:28:07,282
YOU'LL NEVER CHANGE.

1406
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:25,300
THE DOC... OUT OF HIS HEAD,
I GUESS, JIM.

1407
01:28:25,335 --> 01:28:30,805
NO. HE WAS RIGHT.
JUST RIGHT.

1408
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:34,809
HE'S GONE GENTLEMEN.

1409
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:43,818
COLONEL BREWTON,
I HAVE NO IDEA.

1410
01:28:43,853 --> 01:28:45,320
ARE YOU SURE?

1411
01:28:45,355 --> 01:28:47,322
VERY SURE.

1412
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:54,829
I WONDER HOW SHE'S
FIXED FOR MONEY.

1413
01:28:54,864 --> 01:28:57,332
MR. CAMERON LEFT
VERY LITTLE.

1414
01:28:57,832 --> 01:28:59,334
I SEE.

1415
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:08,843
I MIGHT ADD ONE THING.

1416
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:11,809
IF I DID KNOW WHERE YOUR WIFE WAS

1417
01:29:11,810 --> 01:29:14,349
YOU ARE THE LAST ONE I WOULD TELL.

1418
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:16,851
WHY DON'T YOU
LEAVE HER ALONE NOW?

1419
01:30:37,932 --> 01:30:38,933
BROCK! BROCK!

1420
01:30:38,968 --> 01:30:40,935
WAIT A MINUTE, SISTER
LET THEM-LET THEM FINISH!

1421
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:43,938
JEFF! JEFF! BROCK'S FIGHTING AGAIN!

1422
01:30:43,973 --> 01:30:44,939
JEFF!

1423
01:30:44,974 --> 01:30:46,941
BROCK! STOP THAT FIGHTING!

1424
01:30:46,976 --> 01:30:48,943
HEY, ED, I'M BETTING ON THE
CHAMBERLAIN KID!

1425
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:54,449
WHAT'S THAT YOU SAID?

1426
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:56,951
YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID.

1427
01:30:56,986 --> 01:30:59,454
I'M BETTING ON THE CHAMBERLAIN KID.
YOU WANT TO COVER MY BET?

1428
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:15,970
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,
JEFF?

1429
01:31:17,972 --> 01:31:19,974
WHAT WAS SAID
HERE, BILL?

1430
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:25,980
IF ANYBODY'S GOT
ANYTHING TO SAY

1431
01:31:26,015 --> 01:31:27,482
NOW'S THE TIME
TO SAY IT.

1432
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:37,992
COME ON, BROCK.

1433
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:18,032
DON'T WORRY, LUTIE.

1434
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:20,034
I'LL KEEP ON
WRITING TO YOU.

1435
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:23,037
I KNOW YOU'VE TURNED TO ME
ONLY BECAUSE DOC REID IS GONE.

1436
01:32:23,072 --> 01:32:24,539
AND THAT YOU WANT
NOTHING FROM ME

1437
01:32:24,574 --> 01:32:26,541
BUT NEWS OF YOUR CHILDREN.

1438
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:30,545
IN THIS LETTER, I'M SENDING
YOU A LIKENESS OF SARA BETH AND BROCK.

1439
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:32,046
I OBTAINED IT BY DEVIOUS METHODS

1440
01:32:32,081 --> 01:32:34,048
FROM THE LOCAL
PHOTOGRAPHER.

1441
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:39,554
YOU ASK
ABOUT BREWTON, LUTIE.

1442
01:32:39,589 --> 01:32:43,057
I KNOW VERY LITTLE
ABOUT HIM.

1443
01:32:43,092 --> 01:32:44,559
HE SELDOM COMES TO TOWN,

1444
01:32:44,594 --> 01:32:49,063
EXCEPT TO DO SOME BUYING
FOR THE RANCH NOW AND THEN.

1445
01:32:57,071 --> 01:32:58,419
IT WOULD BREAK YOUR HEART

1446
01:32:58,420 --> 01:33:00,575
TO RIDE THROUGH THIS COUNTRY NOW, LUTIE.

1447
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:04,579
IT'S ALL DRYING UP
AND BLOWING AWAY.

1448
01:33:04,614 --> 01:33:08,583
BREWTON WAS RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING.
THIS LAND WAS NOT READY FOR THE PLOW.

1449
01:33:08,618 --> 01:33:11,085
IT NEEDED HELP FROM US.

1450
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,588
DURING THOSE FIRST YEARS
WHEN THE RAINS CAME,

1451
01:33:13,623 --> 01:33:14,997
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT WORK

1452
01:33:14,998 --> 01:33:17,592
PLANNING AGAINST THE TIME
WHEN NATURE WOULD FAIL US.

1453
01:33:17,627 --> 01:33:20,094
WE SHOULD HAVE BUILT DAMS
AND BROUGHT OUR OWN RAIN

1454
01:33:20,129 --> 01:33:24,098
AND IRRIGATION DITCHES
AND CULVERTS AND DIVERTED STREAMS.

1455
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:28,603
SOMEDAY WE WILL DO THESE THINGS
AND THE LAND WILL COME BACK.

1456
01:33:28,638 --> 01:33:31,606
THE HOPE OF SEEING THAT
KEEPS ME HERE.

1457
01:33:31,641 --> 01:33:34,108
AND SOMETHING ELSE
HOLDS ME, TOO.

1458
01:33:34,143 --> 01:33:36,207
BROCK IS GROWING UP, LUTIE,

1459
01:33:36,208 --> 01:33:39,113
AND THE WAY IT'S HAPPENING WORRIES ME.

1460
01:33:39,148 --> 01:33:41,616
WHEN SARAH WAS HOME,
SHE USED TO LOOK OUT FOR HIM.

1461
01:33:41,651 --> 01:33:43,117
BUT NOW THAT SHE'S AWAY
AT SCHOOL,

1462
01:33:43,152 --> 01:33:46,120
BREWTON MAKES NO MOVE
TO CURB BROCK IN ANYTHING.

1463
01:33:46,155 --> 01:33:50,124
IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH HE WERE TRYING
TO MAKE UP TO HIM FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

1464
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:52,126
YOU, LUTIE.

1465
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:57,632
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S BAD FOR BROCK AND I DON'T LIKE IT.

1466
01:34:01,135 --> 01:34:04,639
BUT I'M FORCED TO STAND BY
HELPLESS TO DO ANYTHING,

1467
01:34:04,674 --> 01:34:07,642
AND WATCH THE WILDNESS
IN THE BOY GROW STRONGER.

1468
01:34:11,145 --> 01:34:15,149
EVERYONE LIKES HIM.
MAYBE THAT'S THE TROUBLE.

1469
01:34:15,184 --> 01:34:16,619
HE'S RIGHT AT HOME EVERYPLACE.

1470
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:19,153
WHETHER HE'S JOSHING THE
GIRLS AT CLANCY'S DANCE HALL,

1471
01:34:19,188 --> 01:34:23,157
OR PLAYING THE BLUE DANUBE
ON MYRA NETHERWOODS' NEW GRAND PIANO.

1472
01:34:23,192 --> 01:34:25,159
HE'S A PRIME FAVORITE.

1473
01:34:29,163 --> 01:34:32,166
BUT HE'S A WALKING
CONTRADICTION, TOO.

1474
01:34:32,201 --> 01:34:33,242
ONE DAY HE'LL BE DEALING

1475
01:34:33,243 --> 01:34:35,670
WESTERN EUCHRE FROM THE BEST
HORSEHAIR FURNITURE IN TOWN,

1476
01:34:36,170 --> 01:34:37,296
AND THE NEXT HE'LL BE PRANCING

1477
01:34:37,297 --> 01:34:39,173
UP AND DOWN THE STREETS IN
HIS NEW RED-WHEEL BUGGY

1478
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:41,676
WITH A HOMESTEADER GIRL
BESIDE HIM.

1479
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:48,683
YOU MAY SEE HIM BUYING OUT
A SHOWCASE OF JAWBREAKERS

1480
01:34:49,183 --> 01:34:53,187
AT THE KINGMAN MERCANTILE CO.
FOR A BUNCH OF RUNNY-NOSED KIDS,

1481
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:54,689
GENTLE AS A WOMAN,

1482
01:34:55,189 --> 01:34:57,692
OR KEEPING A TOMATO CAN ROLLING
AT 50 FEET WITH A SIX-SHOOTER.

1483
01:35:02,196 --> 01:35:05,199
IT GIVES ME PAUSE, LUTIE,
TO SEE HIM.

1484
01:35:05,234 --> 01:35:08,703
THERE'S SUCH A LOT OF RECKLESSNESS
UNDER THAT CRAZY CHARM.

1485
01:35:09,203 --> 01:35:12,707
THERE'S A DANGER IN HIM
AND A KIND OF VIOLENCE.

1486
01:35:12,742 --> 01:35:15,710
IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO KEEP MY HANDS OFF.

1487
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:18,355
SOMETIMES WHEN HE LOOKS AT ME AS WE PASS

1488
01:35:18,356 --> 01:35:20,715
THERE'S NEVER MORE THAN
A FLICK OF HIS EYE-

1489
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:25,219
I FEEL THAT HE MUST KNOW SOMETHING,
AND THAT HE MUST HATE ME FOR IT.

1490
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:31,726
I UNDERSTAND SARA BETH GRADUATED
LAST WEEK WITH HIGH HONORS.

1491
01:35:31,761 --> 01:35:33,227
SARAH BETH BREWTON.

1492
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:39,734
HAZEL SAWYER.

1493
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:44,238
THEY TELL ME
SHE'LL BE HOME SOON.

1494
01:35:44,273 --> 01:35:47,310
I WONDER HOW SALT FORK
WILL SEEM TO HER NOW

1495
01:35:47,311 --> 01:35:49,243
AFTER HER YEARS OF SCHOOLING?

1496
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:01,255
PARDON ME, MA'AM.

1497
01:36:04,258 --> 01:36:09,764
I'M LOOKING FOR A LITTLE, SAWED-OFF,
FRECKLED, UGLY RUNT OF A GIRL.

1498
01:36:09,799 --> 01:36:12,266
I'M LOOKING FOR
A HANDSOME YOUNG GENTLEMAN.

1499
01:36:12,301 --> 01:36:14,769
WELL, YOU FOUND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR, BUT HOW ABOUT ME?

1500
01:36:14,804 --> 01:36:16,771
YOU WENT AND
CHANGED ON US.

1501
01:36:16,806 --> 01:36:17,772
OH, BROCK!

1502
01:36:17,807 --> 01:36:18,773
HELLO, SARAH BETH.

1503
01:36:18,808 --> 01:36:20,274
WHERE'S PAPA?

1504
01:36:20,309 --> 01:36:21,275
PAPA!

1505
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:23,277
PAPA!

1506
01:36:27,281 --> 01:36:28,783
GOOD TO SEE YOU,
SARAH BETH.

1507
01:36:28,818 --> 01:36:30,785
OH, I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN
YOU'D BE LIKE THIS, BOTH OF YOU.

1508
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:32,286
LIKE WHAT?

1509
01:36:32,321 --> 01:36:33,788
OH, GOOD-LOOKING.

1510
01:36:40,795 --> 01:36:42,797
A COUPLE OF YEARS DO A LOT FOR
A YOUNG LADY, DON'T THEY?

1511
01:36:42,832 --> 01:36:45,800
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT-
OF ME, I MEAN?

1512
01:36:45,835 --> 01:36:47,802
NOT AS MUCH
AS WE GOT, EH, BROCK?

1513
01:36:47,837 --> 01:36:50,304
NOT HALF. I DON'T KNOW THOUGH.
LOOKS STUCK UP TO ME

1514
01:36:50,339 --> 01:36:51,806
PROBABLY WON'T EVEN
LIKE OUR TOWN ANYMORE.

1515
01:36:51,841 --> 01:36:53,307
YOUR TOWN? MY TOWN.

1516
01:36:53,342 --> 01:36:56,310
OH HO. MAYBE YOU'LL DO,
HUH, COLONEL?

1517
01:37:06,821 --> 01:37:09,824
WELL, IT'S THE SAME OLD
PLACE. SAME...

1518
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:14,328
YEAH. WELL, I'M GONNA LEAVE
YOU HERE.

1519
01:37:14,363 --> 01:37:15,329
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1520
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:17,832
RIGHT HERE. CHARLEY'S.
CARDS ARE PRETTY HOT FOR ME TODAY.

1521
01:37:17,867 --> 01:37:20,334
YOU BETTER NOT GET FRESH WITH
CHARLEY. HE CAN TEACH YOU.

1522
01:37:20,369 --> 01:37:24,839
YEAH? CHARLEY SAID YOU WERE PRETTY
GOOD AT CARDS, BUT I WAS BETTER.

1523
01:37:24,874 --> 01:37:26,340
I CAN TAKE CHARLEY THE BEST
DAY HE EVER LIVED

1524
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:27,842
WITH YOU STANDING
ON HIS SHOULDERS.

1525
01:37:27,877 --> 01:37:32,847
TRY IT ANYTIME YOU SAY, COLONEL,
ANYTIME AT ALL.

1526
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:38,352
I'LL BET THE WOMEN
SPOIL HIM SILLY.

1527
01:37:38,387 --> 01:37:39,353
YEAH.

1528
01:37:39,388 --> 01:37:41,856
NOT ONLY THE WOMEN
EITHER.

1529
01:37:41,891 --> 01:37:44,358
JEFF SAYS HE CAN CHARM THE GOLD
RIGHT OUT OF YOUR TEETH.

1530
01:37:44,393 --> 01:37:46,861
HOW IS JEFF, PAPA?

1531
01:37:46,896 --> 01:37:48,863
WELL, HE'S LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE
AROUND HERE,

1532
01:37:49,363 --> 01:37:50,865
LOST HIS BITE.

1533
01:37:53,868 --> 01:37:55,870
NOT MUCH LIKE THE NIGHTGOWN YOU WORE
WHEN I PUT YOU TO BED.

1534
01:37:55,905 --> 01:37:57,371
OH, JEFF.

1535
01:37:58,908 --> 01:38:01,375
WELL, HOW DO YOU LIKE THE WAY
I FIXED UP YOUR ROOM, HONEY?

1536
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:02,376
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1537
01:38:02,411 --> 01:38:04,378
AIN'T IT, THOUGH?

1538
01:38:04,879 --> 01:38:07,882
I GOT MY IDEA FROM ONE OF THEM
MAGAZINES.

1539
01:38:07,917 --> 01:38:09,884
WELL, IF YOU WANT
ANYTHING, YELL.

1540
01:38:09,919 --> 01:38:11,385
OH, DON'T GO.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

1541
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:12,887
I WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT BROCK.

1542
01:38:12,922 --> 01:38:14,388
WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW?

1543
01:38:14,423 --> 01:38:17,391
OH, JUST HOW HE'S BEEN.
WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING.

1544
01:38:17,426 --> 01:38:20,895
SAME AS ALWAYS. BROCK'S BEEN HAVING
A GOOD TIME FOR BROCK.

1545
01:38:23,397 --> 01:38:24,899
WHAT YOU DOING?

1546
01:38:24,934 --> 01:38:26,901
WHERE'D THIS COME FROM?

1547
01:38:26,936 --> 01:38:29,403
I'VE BEEN SAVING IT.

1548
01:38:34,909 --> 01:38:36,911
WHY DON'T YOU ASK ME SOME MORE
QUESTIONS, SARAH BETH?

1549
01:38:37,411 --> 01:38:38,913
ABOUT WHAT?

1550
01:38:38,948 --> 01:38:42,416
ABOUT HER. AIN'T YOU CURIOUS ABOUT
YOUR MOTHER? YOU NEVER THINK OF HER?

1551
01:38:42,451 --> 01:38:43,918
WHAT FOR?

1552
01:38:43,953 --> 01:38:45,419
SHE'S YOUR MOTHER.

1553
01:38:45,454 --> 01:38:46,921
I DON'T KNOW
WHO SHE IS.

1554
01:38:46,956 --> 01:38:49,924
DON'T YOU EVER WONDER WHY
SHE'S NEVER COME TO SEE YOU?

1555
01:38:49,959 --> 01:38:51,425
YOU'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO SAY GOOD
THINGS ABOUT HER.

1556
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:53,928
YOU'VE ALWAYS STUFFED YOUR EARS
WHEN I DID.

1557
01:38:53,963 --> 01:38:55,930
SHE GAVE UP A LOT WHEN SHE WENT AWAY.

1558
01:38:55,965 --> 01:38:57,932
AND SHE HASN'T GOT MUCH LEFT NOW.

1559
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:59,934
HOW ABOUT PAPA?
HAS HE GOT ANYTHING LEFT?

1560
01:38:59,969 --> 01:39:00,935
HE'S GOT YOU.

1561
01:39:01,435 --> 01:39:02,436
HE'S GOT BROCK.

1562
01:39:02,471 --> 01:39:05,439
YEAH-BROCK.

1563
01:39:12,947 --> 01:39:14,949
PLEASE STOP WHISTLING.

1564
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:19,453
10.

1565
01:39:21,455 --> 01:39:22,957
10. I'LL RAISE YOU 20.

1566
01:39:22,992 --> 01:39:25,459
20.

1567
01:39:27,461 --> 01:39:28,462
3 TREYS.

1568
01:39:28,497 --> 01:39:30,464
3 DEUCES

1569
01:39:32,466 --> 01:39:33,968
YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT, BOY.

1570
01:39:34,003 --> 01:39:35,970
NOBODY CAN BEAT THAT, KID.

1571
01:39:36,005 --> 01:39:38,472
THAT'S RIGHT, CHARLEY.

1572
01:39:38,507 --> 01:39:42,977
NOBODY EVER HAS. YOU OUGHT
TO KNOW THAT, BILL.

1573
01:39:43,012 --> 01:39:45,980
YEAH, I KNOW.

1574
01:39:48,983 --> 01:39:52,987
6. MISDEAL, ISN'T IT?

1575
01:39:53,022 --> 01:39:54,488
OH, HAVE YOU GOT 6, TOO?

1576
01:39:54,523 --> 01:39:58,993
5. I COULD HAVE USED ANOTHER.

1577
01:39:59,028 --> 01:40:00,494
LOOK, KID, GAMBLING IS MY BUSINESS.

1578
01:40:00,529 --> 01:40:01,495
YEAH.

1579
01:40:01,996 --> 01:40:02,997
AND I KNOW MY BUSINESS.

1580
01:40:03,497 --> 01:40:05,499
AFTER THIS, IF I'VE GOT 6 CARDS,
I'LL MAKE IT KNOWN.

1581
01:40:05,534 --> 01:40:07,001
SURE. YOU BET.

1582
01:40:07,036 --> 01:40:08,002
YOU DEAL.

1583
01:40:08,037 --> 01:40:10,504
ANY OF YOU BOYS SEEN CHAMBERLAIN
AROUND? JUDGE CHAMBERLAIN?

1584
01:40:10,539 --> 01:40:11,505
NO. WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH HIM?

1585
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:12,506
HIS OFFICE WANTS HIM.

1586
01:40:12,541 --> 01:40:13,507
TRY THE BANK.

1587
01:40:13,542 --> 01:40:15,509
FORGET IT, JOE.
HE DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

1588
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:18,012
IT'S ALL RIGHT, CHARLEY.

1589
01:40:18,512 --> 01:40:20,514
ALL RIGHT, KID.
YOU'RE THE JUDGE.

1590
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:27,021
JUDGE OF WHAT?

1591
01:40:27,056 --> 01:40:28,522
GO AHEAD. DEAL.

1592
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:40,534
3, JUDGE.

1593
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:49,043
THANK YOU, JUDGE.

1594
01:40:51,545 --> 01:40:53,047
3 FOR THE JUDGE.

1595
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:56,550
$10.

1596
01:40:58,052 --> 01:40:59,053
I'LL LET YOU OFF WITH A LIGHT SENTENCE.

1597
01:41:02,556 --> 01:41:04,058
PAIR OF 9s.

1598
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:07,561
PAIR OF DOGS.

1599
01:41:07,596 --> 01:41:11,065
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD A TWIN
BROTHER, JUDGE.

1600
01:41:24,578 --> 01:41:28,582
ALL RIGHT, BROCK, THE DOOR'S OPEN.
TEMPORARY ANYHOW.

1601
01:41:28,617 --> 01:41:30,584
WHO OPENED IT
FOR ME, BILL?

1602
01:41:33,587 --> 01:41:37,091
SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO SAY THANKS.

1603
01:41:37,126 --> 01:41:38,592
I DON'T KNOW THE PARTY.

1604
01:42:14,628 --> 01:42:18,132
BROCK, YOU'RE HOME!
PAPA, BROCK'S HOME.

1605
01:42:18,632 --> 01:42:20,134
WELL, WERE YOU STILL AS LUCKY?

1606
01:42:20,169 --> 01:42:22,136
OH, SURE.
I'M ALWAYS LUCKY.

1607
01:42:22,171 --> 01:42:23,637
STOP THAT.
PLAY SOMETHING ELSE.

1608
01:42:23,672 --> 01:42:24,638
LIKE?

1609
01:42:24,673 --> 01:42:26,640
OH, ANYTHING BUT
THAT FUNERAL MARCH.

1610
01:42:26,675 --> 01:42:27,641
PLAY SOMETHING WITH PEOPLE IN IT.

1611
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:31,145
CAN'T HAVE A FUNERAL
WITHOUT PEOPLE.

1612
01:42:31,645 --> 01:42:32,646
HAD DINNER?

1613
01:42:34,648 --> 01:42:35,649
YEAH, ATE AT BEATTY'S PLACE
ON THE WAY OUT.

1614
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:37,651
BROCK SAID HE WAS LUCKY AGAIN, PAPA.

1615
01:42:38,152 --> 01:42:40,154
REALLY? THAT'S FUNNY.
LOOKS TO ME LIKE THE BOYS TOOK HIM.

1616
01:42:40,189 --> 01:42:43,157
THEY TRIED. I WAS PLAYING WITH
JOE HORTON.

1617
01:42:43,192 --> 01:42:46,160
HORTON? HE'S A BAD BOY. YOU
WANT TO LOOK OUT FOR HIM.

1618
01:42:46,195 --> 01:42:48,162
I DID, IN ONE HAND,
ESPECIALLY.

1619
01:42:48,197 --> 01:42:51,665
WE BOTH DREW ONE,
ONLY I DREW FIRST.

1620
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:53,167
GOT HIM RIGHT
IN THE BELLY.

1621
01:42:53,202 --> 01:42:54,668
YOU MEAN
YOU SHOT HIM.

1622
01:42:54,703 --> 01:42:57,671
NOT CONCLUSIVELY.
HE'S GOING TO LIVE.

1623
01:42:57,706 --> 01:42:59,173
WHAT HAPPENED?
HOW'D THE FIGHT START?

1624
01:42:59,208 --> 01:43:01,675
AH, I HAD A FEW TOO MANY, I GUESS.
I DON'T REMEMBER.

1625
01:43:01,710 --> 01:43:03,177
I NEVER SAW YOU
THAT DRUNK.

1626
01:43:03,677 --> 01:43:05,179
THEN I'M A-LYIN'.

1627
01:43:05,214 --> 01:43:06,680
HOW LONG WERE YOU IN JAIL?

1628
01:43:06,715 --> 01:43:08,182
NOT LONG.

1629
01:43:08,217 --> 01:43:10,684
WHO GOT YOU OUT?
MCCURTIN?

1630
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:12,686
HASN'T HE ALWAYS
BEFORE?

1631
01:43:12,721 --> 01:43:15,689
YEAH. WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO TELL
ME HOW THE FIGHT STARTED?

1632
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:19,193
I TOLD YOU. I WAS DRUNK.

1633
01:43:19,228 --> 01:43:22,196
NOW, IF YOU'D RATHER I HADN'T
COME HOME, I'LL GET OUT.

1634
01:43:22,231 --> 01:43:24,198
I'D RATHER YOU DIDN'T LIE, BROCK.

1635
01:43:24,233 --> 01:43:25,699
NOW, COME ON, LET'S GO
INTO TOWN.

1636
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:27,201
AND FACE WHATEVER'S
GOT TO BE FACED.

1637
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:29,203
NOT ME. I'M GOING
TO DENVER.

1638
01:43:29,238 --> 01:43:30,704
YOU'RE GOING TO SALT FORK,
BROCK,

1639
01:43:30,739 --> 01:43:33,207
AND GET THIS THING OVER WITH
AND THEN YOU'RE COMING BACK HERE.

1640
01:43:33,242 --> 01:43:34,708
AND IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA

1641
01:43:35,209 --> 01:43:37,711
IF YOU SPENT A LITTLE MORE TIME
HERE IN THE FUTURE.

1642
01:43:37,746 --> 01:43:39,713
YOU CAN'T RUN ME
ANYMORE!

1643
01:43:39,748 --> 01:43:43,217
I WASN'T CUT OUT FOR LIVING YOUR WAY
AND I'M SICK OF TRYING.

1644
01:43:43,252 --> 01:43:45,219
I'D RATHER BE STUFFED
IN A COFFIN!

1645
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:47,721
I DON'T MIND THE SHOOTING SO MUCH-

1646
01:43:48,222 --> 01:43:49,723
I WOULDN'T GIVE MUCH FOR YOU IF
YOU COULDN'T DEFEND YOURSELF-

1647
01:43:49,758 --> 01:43:52,726
BUT JUMPING BAIL IS ANOTHER THING.
IT ISN'T SQUARE.

1648
01:43:52,761 --> 01:43:55,729
I WANT YOU TO GO INTO TOWN
AND STAND TRIAL ON YOUR OWN FEET.

1649
01:43:55,764 --> 01:43:57,731
CLEAR YOURSELF OR TAKE
THE CONSEQUENCES.

1650
01:43:57,766 --> 01:44:00,234
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO WORK IT OUT, BROCK.

1651
01:44:03,737 --> 01:44:06,740
WHEN YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING MORE
TO SAY TO ME, I'LL BE AROUND.

1652
01:44:11,745 --> 01:44:13,247
THAT WAS NICE.
THAT WAS FINE.

1653
01:44:13,282 --> 01:44:14,748
TAKE IT EASY.

1654
01:44:15,249 --> 01:44:16,250
YOU KNOW YOU CAN
HURT HIM MORE THAN ANYONE.

1655
01:44:16,285 --> 01:44:17,751
YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU?

1656
01:44:17,786 --> 01:44:18,752
TAKE IT EASY, SARAH BETH.

1657
01:44:18,787 --> 01:44:20,254
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE LEAVING.

1658
01:44:20,289 --> 01:44:21,755
I GOT TO THINK.

1659
01:44:23,292 --> 01:44:26,760
HOW CAN A MAN THINK
WITHOUT A LITTLE MUSIC?

1660
01:44:26,795 --> 01:44:27,761
JIM HERE?

1661
01:44:27,796 --> 01:44:29,763
AROUND SOME PLACE.
OUT BACK, I GUESS.

1662
01:44:29,798 --> 01:44:31,265
WHERE'S BROCK?

1663
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:40,774
HELLO, MR. MCCURTIN.

1664
01:44:40,809 --> 01:44:43,277
YOU TELL HIM ABOUT
THE SHOOTING, BROCK?

1665
01:44:43,312 --> 01:44:44,582
OH, HELLO, MACK.

1666
01:44:44,583 --> 01:44:47,281
SURE I TOLD HIM. WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1667
01:44:47,781 --> 01:44:49,283
HORTON DIED.

1668
01:44:51,785 --> 01:44:52,786
FIGURED HE WAS
TOO MEAN TO DIE.

1669
01:44:52,821 --> 01:44:55,289
I CAN GET YOU OFF
ONCE MORE, MAYBE.

1670
01:44:55,324 --> 01:44:57,291
YOU MUST HAVE HAD A GOOD REASON
TO SHOOT A MAN.

1671
01:44:57,326 --> 01:44:58,792
YOU HAD ONE,
DIDN'T YOU?

1672
01:44:58,827 --> 01:45:02,296
GOOD REASON?
WHY, SURE-THE BEST.

1673
01:45:02,331 --> 01:45:03,797
BETTER COME BACK IN WITH ME.

1674
01:45:03,832 --> 01:45:05,299
HAVE YOU TOLD
THE COLONEL?

1675
01:45:05,334 --> 01:45:07,801
I CAN'T FACE HIM.

1676
01:45:07,836 --> 01:45:10,304
I'VE GONE THAT ONE TIME OVER
BRINGING HIM BAD NEWS.

1677
01:45:10,339 --> 01:45:11,805
ARE YOU COMING?

1678
01:45:13,307 --> 01:45:14,808
NO.

1679
01:45:14,843 --> 01:45:16,810
THEN I'M FINISHED, BROCK,
AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED.

1680
01:45:16,845 --> 01:45:18,812
TOO MUCH FOR ME.

1681
01:45:18,847 --> 01:45:20,055
ONE LAST WORD-

1682
01:45:20,056 --> 01:45:22,816
I ADVISE YOU TO GET IN TOWN FAST.

1683
01:45:24,318 --> 01:45:26,320
SARAH BETH, TELL YOUR FATHER
I COULDN'T WAIT.

1684
01:45:26,355 --> 01:45:29,823
YOU CAN GET OUT OF THIS YOURSELF OR
THE WAY YOU GOT OUT OF JAIL.

1685
01:45:34,328 --> 01:45:36,330
WHAT DID MR. MCCURTAIN MEAN,
"THE WAY YOU GOT OUT OF JAIL"?

1686
01:45:36,365 --> 01:45:37,831
HE GOT YOU OUT, DIDN'T HE?

1687
01:45:37,866 --> 01:45:38,832
NO.

1688
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:40,334
WHO DID?

1689
01:45:40,369 --> 01:45:42,836
CHAMBERLAIN.

1690
01:45:42,871 --> 01:45:44,838
I GUESS HE FIGURES
THE YOUNG AND FOOLISH

1691
01:45:44,873 --> 01:45:46,340
SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE,
OR SOMETHING.

1692
01:45:46,375 --> 01:45:48,342
ALL RIGHT, BROCK, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO COVER UP WITH ME.

1693
01:45:48,842 --> 01:45:49,843
I'VE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME.

1694
01:45:51,380 --> 01:45:52,346
WHEN?

1695
01:45:52,381 --> 01:45:53,847
FOR SURE WHEN I WAS 15.

1696
01:45:53,882 --> 01:45:54,848
HOW?

1697
01:45:54,883 --> 01:45:56,850
A LOT OF THINGS
PUT TOGETHER.

1698
01:45:56,885 --> 01:45:59,853
AND BEFORE I WENT BACK TO SCHOOL
THE LAST TIME, I KNEW YOU KNEW IT

1699
01:45:59,888 --> 01:46:01,855
AND I KNEW PAPA DID.

1700
01:46:03,357 --> 01:46:05,859
I COULD KILL CHAMBERLAIN.

1701
01:46:09,863 --> 01:46:12,366
THAT'S WHAT THE
TROUBLE WAS ABOUT.

1702
01:46:12,401 --> 01:46:14,868
THIS FELLOW I WAS GAMBLING WITH,
HE SAID A FEW THING.

1703
01:46:14,903 --> 01:46:16,870
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T
TELL THE COLONEL.

1704
01:46:16,905 --> 01:46:18,872
I COULDN'T LET HIM
KNOW THAT I KNOW.

1705
01:46:18,907 --> 01:46:20,374
OH, BROCK.

1706
01:46:20,409 --> 01:46:22,876
WE'VE BEEN AROUND A LOT
TOGETHER, THE COLONEL AND ME.

1707
01:46:22,911 --> 01:46:25,722
AND HE NEVER LET ANYBODY
EVEN THINK ANYTHING ONCE,

1708
01:46:25,723 --> 01:46:26,880
AT LEAST NOT OUT LOUD.

1709
01:46:26,915 --> 01:46:28,882
DON'T I KNOW.

1710
01:46:28,917 --> 01:46:31,385
I'M GLAD I KNOW THAT, TOO-
I MEAN, THAT YOU LOVE HIM.

1711
01:46:31,420 --> 01:46:35,389
IF I HATED HIM,
I'D BE ALL RIGHT.

1712
01:46:35,424 --> 01:46:36,890
THEN WE COULD WALK DOWN
THE STREET TOGETHER

1713
01:46:36,925 --> 01:46:41,395
AND I WOULDN'T MIND FEELING
HIM CRINGE-NEVER LET ON.

1714
01:46:41,430 --> 01:46:44,898
OH, I SHOULD HAVE GONE Movie AWAY
FROM HERE A LONG TIME AGO.

1715
01:46:45,399 --> 01:46:47,401
BUT HE'S HARD TO LEAVE.

1716
01:46:48,902 --> 01:46:51,405
NOW I GOT TO GET
OUT OF HERE FAST.

1717
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:52,429
DON'T RUN AWAY, BROCK.

1718
01:46:52,430 --> 01:46:54,408
MR. MCCURTIN COULD GET
YOU OFF, COULDN'T HE?

1719
01:46:54,443 --> 01:46:56,910
OH, SURE, EASY. THE JURY WOULDN'T
EVEN LEAVE ITS BOX.

1720
01:46:56,945 --> 01:46:58,912
THEN FACE IT LIKE
PAPA WANTS YOU TO.

1721
01:46:58,947 --> 01:47:00,414
EVER BEEN TO A TRIAL,
SARAH BETH?

1722
01:47:00,449 --> 01:47:04,418
LOTS OF THINGS COME OUT OF TRIALS.
WHOLE MESS COMES OUT.

1723
01:47:04,453 --> 01:47:07,932
SALT FORK WOULD EAT
THIS UP WITH A SPOON,

1724
01:47:07,933 --> 01:47:09,423
AND HE'S HAD ENOUGH.

1725
01:47:12,426 --> 01:47:16,430
GO ON, SARAH BETH, SIT DOWN AND
PLAY A TUNE BY YOURSELF.

1726
01:47:16,465 --> 01:47:18,432
YOU'LL HAVE TO GET USED TO IT.

1727
01:47:18,467 --> 01:47:20,934
AND TELL THE COLONEL NOTHING.

1728
01:47:34,948 --> 01:47:36,950
JEFF SAID MCCURTIN WAS HERE.
WHAT DID HE WANT?

1729
01:47:36,985 --> 01:47:37,951
NOTHING.

1730
01:47:37,986 --> 01:47:39,453
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1731
01:47:39,488 --> 01:47:40,954
FIRST LAP OF
MY TRIP TO DENVER.

1732
01:47:40,989 --> 01:47:42,456
GET DOWN OFF THAT HORSE, BROCK.

1733
01:47:42,491 --> 01:47:43,957
GET OUT OF MY WAY.

1734
01:47:57,971 --> 01:48:02,476
WELL, SARAH BETH, I'LL TRY TO
UNDERSTAND WHY HE HAD TO GO.

1735
01:48:02,511 --> 01:48:07,481
I DIDN'T TRY WITH SOMEONE
ELSE A LONG TIME AGO.

1736
01:48:07,516 --> 01:48:10,484
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SORRY.

1737
01:48:39,012 --> 01:48:41,014
WELL, COLONEL, THEN
IF BROCK AIN'T HERE

1738
01:48:41,049 --> 01:48:42,015
WE JUST GOTTA FIND HIM
AND TAKE HIM IN.

1739
01:48:42,050 --> 01:48:44,017
WHY?

1740
01:48:44,052 --> 01:48:46,520
I THOUGHT MCCURTIN
TOLD YOU.

1741
01:48:46,555 --> 01:48:48,021
HORTON DIED.

1742
01:48:50,524 --> 01:48:52,526
SORRY, COLONEL.

1743
01:48:55,028 --> 01:48:57,030
THINGS FALL THAT WAY
SOMETIMES, BILL.

1744
01:48:57,531 --> 01:48:59,032
YEAH.

1745
01:49:00,534 --> 01:49:03,537
YOU SURE HE AIN'T HERE?

1746
01:49:03,572 --> 01:49:04,538
YOU CAN LOOK.

1747
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:12,540
I... I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED THAT,
COLONEL. GOOD NIGHT.

1748
01:49:25,559 --> 01:49:27,534
WHY IS BROCK FRIGHTENED, SARAH BETH?

1749
01:49:27,535 --> 01:49:29,563
DOESN'T HE KNOW MACK CAN GET HIM OFF?

1750
01:49:29,598 --> 01:49:35,068
BUT HE KNOWS HE CAN'T GET
YOU OFF.

1751
01:49:35,103 --> 01:49:38,071
THE MAN BROCK SHOT,
HE CALLED BROCK NAMES.

1752
01:49:38,106 --> 01:49:40,574
NOT PRETTY NAMES,
EITHER.

1753
01:49:40,609 --> 01:49:44,578
THEY'D SOUND AWFUL AT A TRIAL,
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE TRUE.

1754
01:49:44,613 --> 01:49:49,583
BROCK THOUGHT-HE WANTED TO
SPARE YOU SOMETHING.

1755
01:49:51,084 --> 01:49:54,588
HE CAN'T SPARE ME
ANYTHING.

1756
01:49:54,623 --> 01:49:58,091
IT SEEMS NONE OF US CAN
SPARE THE OTHERS ANYTHING.

1757
01:50:01,094 --> 01:50:05,599
YOU GO TO BED.
I'VE GOT TO FIND HIM.

1758
01:50:06,099 --> 01:50:09,102
I'VE GOT TO GET TO HIM
BEFORE HE DOES SOMETHING.

1759
01:50:09,603 --> 01:50:13,106
I'VE GOT TO GET TO HIM
BEFORE SOME SHERIFF GETS HIM.

1760
01:50:13,141 --> 01:50:14,608
HE'S A GOOD BOY,
SARAH BETH.

1761
01:50:14,643 --> 01:50:18,612
YES. I'M GLAD WE KNOW HOW GOOD.
YOU FIND HIM, PAPA.

1762
01:50:20,614 --> 01:50:21,615
I'LL FIND HIM.

1763
01:50:26,119 --> 01:50:28,622
GET YOUR AFTERNOON STAR-
HERE'S YOUR CHANGE, LADY.

1764
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:33,126
LATEAFTERNOON STAR.
THANK YOU, SIR.

1765
01:50:33,161 --> 01:50:35,128
RIGHT OVER HERE-
GET YOUR LATE AFTERNOON STAR!

1766
01:50:35,163 --> 01:50:38,632
AFTERNOON STAR! LATEST NEWS AND
THE LATEST PAPER!

1767
01:50:38,667 --> 01:50:40,133
RIGHT HERE. THAT THE IDEA.
THANK YOU, SIR.

1768
01:50:40,634 --> 01:50:41,392
LATE AFTERNOON STAR!

1769
01:50:41,393 --> 01:50:43,136
RIGHT OVER HERE! GET
YOUR LATE AFTERNOON STAR!

1770
01:50:49,643 --> 01:50:51,144
HERE COMES THE COLONEL.

1771
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:04,157
HE'S IN THAT
CABIN, COLONEL.

1772
01:51:06,194 --> 01:51:09,162
YOU CAN'T GO DOWN THERE, COLONEL!
THE BOY'S GONE CRAZY!

1773
01:51:34,187 --> 01:51:36,189
GO ON BACK!

1774
01:51:36,224 --> 01:51:39,192
NO ONE'S TAKING ME, AND
THAT GOES FOR YOU, TOO!

1775
01:51:40,694 --> 01:51:43,196
STAY THERE, OR I'LL DROP
YOU! I MEAN IT!

1776
01:51:45,198 --> 01:51:48,201
YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO TURN AROUND!

1777
01:51:48,236 --> 01:51:50,704
I'LL COUNT 3!

1778
01:51:50,739 --> 01:51:52,205
1...

1779
01:51:55,208 --> 01:51:56,209
2...

1780
01:52:01,715 --> 01:52:02,716
3.

1781
01:52:14,728 --> 01:52:16,730
HURRY IT UP!

1782
01:52:37,751 --> 01:52:42,756
OH, DAD. WHY AM I
CALLING YOU DAD?

1783
01:52:42,791 --> 01:52:44,758
YOU USED TO CALL
ME THAT, BROCK.

1784
01:52:44,793 --> 01:52:47,761
NOT SINCE I GOT OLD
ENOUGH TO KNOW BETTER.

1785
01:52:47,796 --> 01:52:50,263
GROWING UP-THAT'S
GREAT, ISN'T IT?

1786
01:52:50,298 --> 01:52:52,766
DON'T TALK.
DON'T TALK.

1787
01:52:52,801 --> 01:52:55,268
YOU DON'T SCARE
WORTH A NICKEL, DAD.

1788
01:53:03,777 --> 01:53:05,278
DOCS ALWAYS TRY SOMETHING.

1789
01:53:05,313 --> 01:53:06,780
LIE STILL, KID.

1790
01:53:06,815 --> 01:53:10,784
LIE STILL. NOT WHILE I'M STILL
BREATHING IN AND OUT.

1791
01:53:10,819 --> 01:53:13,286
LYING STILL COMES LATER.

1792
01:53:13,321 --> 01:53:15,789
NOT MUCH LATER, THOUGH,
HUH, DOC?

1793
01:53:17,290 --> 01:53:19,793
HELLO, SHERIFF!

1794
01:53:19,828 --> 01:53:21,294
SOMEBODY LEFT
A NOTE FOR YOU.

1795
01:53:21,795 --> 01:53:24,297
RIGHT SIDE OF YOU.

1796
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:48,321
BROCK.

1797
01:53:53,827 --> 01:53:56,329
YOUR SISTER SENDS
HER LOVE, SON.

1798
01:53:56,364 --> 01:53:58,832
THE GOOD GIRL.

1799
01:53:58,867 --> 01:54:00,834
GOOD, BRIGHT GIRL.

1800
01:54:03,336 --> 01:54:05,839
SHE TOLD ME, BROCK.

1801
01:54:05,874 --> 01:54:09,342
SHE TOLD ME WHY YOU
DUCKED OUT.

1802
01:54:11,845 --> 01:54:14,848
AND, BROCK...

1803
01:54:14,883 --> 01:54:16,850
YOUR MOTHER...

1804
01:54:16,885 --> 01:54:18,351
THERE'S SOMETHING...

1805
01:54:18,386 --> 01:54:21,855
DAD, LET'S GO DOWN
TO CHARLEY'S, HMM?

1806
01:54:21,890 --> 01:54:25,358
LET'S DRINK ALL THE PLACE
UNDER THE TABLE.

1807
01:54:25,393 --> 01:54:27,861
AND THEN WHEN THERE'S
JUST ME AND YOU LEFT

1808
01:54:27,896 --> 01:54:29,863
I'LL DRINK YOU UNDER.

1809
01:54:29,898 --> 01:54:31,865
ASK CHARLEY.

1810
01:54:33,867 --> 01:54:35,869
HOW ABOUT IT?

1811
01:54:38,872 --> 01:54:40,874
DA-DAD...

1812
01:54:44,377 --> 01:54:46,880
DAD.

1813
01:55:28,421 --> 01:55:30,423
I GOT IT FOR YOU,
LAST STOP, MA'AM.

1814
01:55:54,948 --> 01:55:56,449
GOT ANYTHING
FOR ME TO PICK UP?

1815
01:55:56,484 --> 01:55:57,951
NO. NOTHING TODAY.

1816
01:55:57,986 --> 01:55:59,452
I BEG YOUR PARDON, IS THERE
A TRAIN LEAVING

1817
01:55:59,487 --> 01:56:00,954
FOR SAN FRANCISCO TOMORROW?

1818
01:56:00,989 --> 01:56:02,455
ONE AT 11:00 O'CLOCK TONIGHT.

1819
01:56:02,490 --> 01:56:03,957
THANK YOU.

1820
01:57:09,022 --> 01:57:12,525
AND SO WE'LL COME TO
PAY OUR LAST RESPECTS

1821
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:15,528
AND TO SAY GOODBYE
TO BROCK BREWTON

1822
01:57:15,563 --> 01:57:21,034
BELOVED SON OF JAMES BREWTON
AND LUTIE C. BREWTON.

1823
01:57:21,069 --> 01:57:25,038
THIS YOUNG MAN HAS
DEPARTED FROM OUR MIDST.

1824
01:57:25,073 --> 01:57:29,542
THE LORD GAVE.
THE LORD HATH TAKEN AWAY.

1825
01:57:29,577 --> 01:57:31,544
LET US PRAY.

1826
01:57:36,084 --> 01:57:37,050
COME IN.

1827
01:57:43,056 --> 01:57:45,558
JUST PUT THE COFFEE
ON THE TABLE, PLEASE.

1828
01:57:55,568 --> 01:57:57,070
YOU'RE SARAH BETH.

1829
01:57:57,105 --> 01:57:57,805
YES.

1830
01:57:59,572 --> 01:58:01,074
PLEASE SIT DOWN.

1831
01:58:01,109 --> 01:58:02,575
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR THAT.

1832
01:58:02,610 --> 01:58:04,577
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, AND THEN
I'M GOING TO GO.

1833
01:58:04,612 --> 01:58:07,580
HOW DID YOU KNOW
I WAS HERE?

1834
01:58:07,615 --> 01:58:10,583
I HAVE A ROOM AT THE HOTEL.
THE CLERK TOLD ME.

1835
01:58:10,618 --> 01:58:13,586
I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU HURT
POP ANYMORE!

1836
01:58:13,621 --> 01:58:15,088
HE CAN'T STAND ANYMORE.

1837
01:58:15,123 --> 01:58:17,590
MAYBE YOU COULDN'T HURT HIM,
EVEN IF YOU TRIED.

1838
01:58:17,625 --> 01:58:19,592
MAYBE THERE'S NOT ANYTHING THAT
CAN HURT HIM,

1839
01:58:19,627 --> 01:58:21,094
NOT AFTER BROCK.

1840
01:58:21,129 --> 01:58:22,595
I HOPE SO.

1841
01:58:22,630 --> 01:58:24,597
BECAUSE NOBODY CAN STAND
ANYMORE, EVEN HIM.

1842
01:58:24,632 --> 01:58:27,100
SO MAYBE THE PAIN'S
OVER NOW.

1843
01:58:27,135 --> 01:58:28,101
UNLESS YOU BROUGHT HIM MORE.

1844
01:58:28,136 --> 01:58:29,102
HAVE YOU?

1845
01:58:29,602 --> 01:58:31,104
WHAT DO YOU
WANT OF HIM?

1846
01:58:33,106 --> 01:58:34,607
NOTHING.

1847
01:58:35,108 --> 01:58:38,611
I CAME TO HELP BROCK.

1848
01:58:38,646 --> 01:58:41,114
I DIDN'T KNOW HE-

1849
01:58:41,149 --> 01:58:45,118
I... I DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL THE TRAIN
WAS ALMOST HERE.

1850
01:58:45,618 --> 01:58:48,121
I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO SEE
YOUR FATHER, SARAH BETH.

1851
01:58:49,657 --> 01:58:51,624
I MIGHT TRY IF I THOUGH
I COULD MAKE UP

1852
01:58:51,659 --> 01:58:54,127
A LITTLE TO HIM. AND TO YOU FOR
ALL THE YEARS,

1853
01:58:54,627 --> 01:58:56,629
BUT I KNOW I COULDN'T.

1854
01:58:57,130 --> 01:58:58,631
HE TRIED TO TELL ME
HOW HE FELT,

1855
01:58:58,666 --> 01:59:02,135
HOW THE GRASS WAS SOMEHOW
GODLY TO HIM.

1856
01:59:02,170 --> 01:59:05,638
HE TRIED TO TELL ME
AND I DIDN'T HEAR.

1857
01:59:06,139 --> 01:59:08,141
AND HE WAS RIGHT.

1858
01:59:10,143 --> 01:59:11,644
THOSE YEARS ARE GONE,

1859
01:59:12,145 --> 01:59:15,148
AND MY CHANCE WITH HIM.

1860
01:59:15,183 --> 01:59:18,151
I'LL LEAVE TONIGHT, SARAH BETH,

1861
01:59:18,651 --> 01:59:21,154
BUT I'M NOT SORRY
I CAME NOW,

1862
01:59:21,189 --> 01:59:22,655
BECAUSE I'LL TAKE SOMETHING
BACK WITH ME

1863
01:59:23,156 --> 01:59:25,658
WHICH MEANS
A GREAT DEAL TO ME:

1864
01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:28,661
THE KNOWLEDGE
THAT HE HAS YOU-

1865
01:59:29,162 --> 01:59:31,664
YOU TO FIGHT FOR HIM,

1866
01:59:31,699 --> 01:59:34,167
BE THERE WHEN HE NEEDS YOU,

1867
01:59:34,202 --> 01:59:38,171
TO BE WHAT I WASN'T
STRONG ENOUGH TO BE.

1868
01:59:38,671 --> 01:59:41,674
HE DIDN'T COME TO ST. LOUIS
FOR NOTHING.

1869
01:59:41,709 --> 01:59:44,677
AND NOW, WHEN HE'S LOST
IT ALL, EVERYTHING,

1870
01:59:44,712 --> 01:59:49,182
WHEN HE NEEDS SOMETHING
HUMAN AT LAST,

1871
01:59:49,682 --> 01:59:52,185
YOU COME INTO THE FIELD.

1872
01:59:52,220 --> 01:59:54,687
NO, HE DIDN'T COME
TO ST. LOUIS FOR NOTHING.

1873
01:59:55,188 --> 01:59:59,692
AND ALL AT ONCE
THAT GIVES ME... PEACE.

1874
02:00:00,193 --> 02:00:02,695
A KIND OF HAPPINESS EVEN.

1875
02:00:03,196 --> 02:00:06,699
I HAVEN'T FELT THAT
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

1876
02:00:08,701 --> 02:00:10,203
JUST ONE THING.

1877
02:00:10,703 --> 02:00:13,206
SOME NIGHT WHEN HE'S SITTING
ON THE PORCH, SARAH BETH,

1878
02:00:13,706 --> 02:00:15,708
GIVE HIM A KISS FROM ME.

1879
02:00:15,743 --> 02:00:17,710
OH, DON'T...

1880
02:00:38,231 --> 02:00:40,733
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HOME, COLONEL.

1881
02:00:41,234 --> 02:00:42,235
THE BUCKBOARD WITH
SARAH BETH GET IN?

1882
02:00:42,270 --> 02:00:44,737
I MISSED SEEING HER START.

1883
02:00:44,772 --> 02:00:47,240
MAYBE YOU'D BETTER
GO ON IN THE HOUSE, COLONEL.

1884
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:58,751
SARAH BETH?

1885
02:00:58,786 --> 02:01:01,254
PAPA, COME HERE.

1886
02:01:18,771 --> 02:01:19,546
PAPA, COME HERE.

1887
02:01:19,547 --> 02:01:21,774
MOTHER WANTED TO BE
WAITING FOR YOU HERE, PAPA.

1888
02:01:21,809 --> 02:01:23,776
THE WAY SHE USED TO BE.

1889
02:01:43,296 --> 02:01:45,298
LUTIE?

1890
02:01:45,333 --> 02:01:47,300
YOU'RE WELL?

1891
02:01:47,335 --> 02:01:49,802
YES, JIM.

1892
02:01:49,837 --> 02:01:53,306
AND YOU?

1893
02:01:53,341 --> 02:01:57,310
YOU LOOK AS YOU ALWAYS DID.

1894
02:01:58,811 --> 02:02:00,813
DO I, JIM?

1895
02:02:24,837 --> 02:02:26,339
PAPA.

1896
02:02:28,841 --> 02:02:32,345
IT WAS A HARD THING
FOR HER TO GO THROUGH,

1897
02:02:32,380 --> 02:02:34,847
BUT SHE'S ONE
IN A THOUSAND.

1898
02:02:34,882 --> 02:02:36,849
NO ONE ELSE WILL EVER BE LIKE HER.
