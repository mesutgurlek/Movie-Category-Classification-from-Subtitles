1
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:54,511
Hey, Mama. Mom! Look at that.

2
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,282
Look, Mommy, look.

3
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:08,653
Johnny!

4
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,781
Now you let Mommy do the talking.
Remember.

5
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,312
Yes, Mom.

6
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,219
But he has no horse.

7
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:41,887
No talking.

8
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,679
Good morning.

9
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,341
- You look like you've had trouble.
- Yep.

10
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:09,785
I lost my horse a few days ago
getting away from some Indians.

11
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:10,947
Indians?

12
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:14,221
We made dry camp last night
above the llano.

13
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:18,527
Sam here smelled more Apaches,
nuzzled me up.

14
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,724
So I thought I'd put some miles between us.

15
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,858
But why? We're at peace with the Apache.

16
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,630
- We have a treaty.
- Yes, ma'am.

17
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:28,138
Now I got to get me a new horse,
borrow or buy one.

18
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:32,540
I can pay you in United States script.
I'm riding a dispatch for General Crook.

19
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:35,979
- My name's Lane.
- I'm Mrs. Lowe.

20
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,578
I'm Johnny.

21
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,685
- The water sure looks inviting.
- Well, help yourself.

22
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,618
Watch out for that dog, son.

23
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:46,291
Could you hire me or sell me a horse,
Mrs. Lowe?

24
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:50,522
Of course. I've only got plow horses,
and two that are only half-broken.

25
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,496
The hand that was breaking them for me
got hurt and had to go to town.

26
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:59,271
- You mean you're staying here alone?
- Oh, no.

27
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,836
No, my husband is up in the hills...

28
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,966
- working some cattle.
- Oh.

29
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,342
He would pick today to be away,
when we have a visitor.

30
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,412
I'd enjoy meeting him, ma'am.

31
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,782
I wouldn't touch that dog, son.
He don't take to petting.

32
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:20,292
And now if you'll allow, ma'am,
I'll take a look at those horses.

33
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,157
Of course.
You'll find a saddle over by the barn.

34
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:27,091
In the meantime, I'll fix you something
to eat. I imagine you're hungry.

35
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,827
I could eat. Thank you.

36
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:08,434
I'm so sorry my husband had to pick today
to go hunting those lost calves.

37
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,608
He would have enjoyed
having a man to talk to.

38
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,247
We welcome visitors.

39
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,114
Must be right lonely around here.
Especially for a woman.

40
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,384
I don't mind. I was raised here.

41
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,461
- What can I feed your dog?
- Nothing, thanks.

42
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,325
He makes out by himself.
Can outrun any rabbit in the territory.

43
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,334
It's no trouble at all.

44
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:41,865
If you don't mind, ma'am,
I'd rather you didn't feed him.

45
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:46,237
I see. You don't want him to get in the habit
of taking food from anyone else.

46
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,211
Well, you can hand it to him.

47
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:52,450
No, ma'am, I don't feed him, either.
Sam's independent.

48
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,620
He doesn't need anybody.
I want him to stay that way.

49
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,253
It's a good way.

50
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:02,155
- Everyone needs someone.
- Yes, ma'am. Most everyone.

51
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,626
Too bad, isn't it?

52
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,031
- You're a good cook, ma'am.
- Thank you.

53
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:09,533
A woman should be a good cook.
Good cook myself.

54
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,698
Why didn't you get on him
when he was stuck?

55
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:43,291
'Cause I didn't want him sitting on me
from a standing start.

56
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,069
Stay with him.

57
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,066
You chose the most savage one.

58
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,104
I won't give you an argument there.

59
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,700
He's always been a fighter.

60
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,940
I wouldn't give a plugged nickel
for a horse that wouldn't fight.

61
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,516
It lets you down when the going gets tough.

62
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,184
It's a little dull.

63
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,154
Well, I can do almost everything
around a ranch, but I never could...

64
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,090
put an edge on an axe.

65
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,318
Where is it?

66
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,854
- What?
- The grindstone.

67
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,875
This ranch looks like it's been here
a little while.

68
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,435
Yes, I was born here.
My husband was raised here, too.

69
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,482
He's an orphan. His parents got killed
in a wagon-train massacre...

70
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,281
so my father took him in.

71
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,914
- Handy.
- What do you mean?

72
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,482
Well, it seems the figures are against it.

73
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:18,330
Only young fellow in 1,000 square miles...

74
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,996
only young girl in 1,000 square miles.

75
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:26,506
They get in a whirl over each other.
That's what I meant. Handy.

76
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,167
I guess it was quite a coincidence.

77
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:34,238
But they say that the right two people are
going to meet by an arrangement of destiny.

78
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,645
You believe that, Mrs. Lowe?

79
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,708
- Yes, I do.
- Interesting.

80
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:52,589
Always sink a blade into a log, son.
Keeps the edge clean.

81
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,894
Well, I guess I'd better quit stalling
and get back to that horse.

82
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,698
And can I play with Sam now?

83
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,303
I've told you twice not to.

84
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,398
But you do what you wanna do.

85
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,553
Really, Mr. Lane, if you knew
the dog would bite, I should think...

86
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:21,286
Mrs. Lowe, people learn by getting bit.
Youngster just learned.

87
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,021
Johnny.

88
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,761
Don't you ever touch that dog again!
Now go in and take your nap.

89
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,741
While I'm at it, I'll shoe those plow horses.

90
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:19,046
Thank you very much.
They do need a shoeing, I guess.

91
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,345
They do.

92
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:24,887
I guess my husband's having a hard time
finding those strayed calves.

93
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,486
I guess he is.

94
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,794
Perhaps he won't be home
until late tonight...

95
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:34,491
or he may even camp in the hills
and come in tomorrow after you're gone.

96
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:38,937
He'll be so sorry to have missed
one of our very few occasional visitors.

97
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,937
I guess I'll go and look after Johnny.

98
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,110
Mrs. Lowe, you're a liar.

99
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:50,205
- And an almighty poor liar.
- I don't understand you.

100
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,147
These horses haven't been shod
in a couple of months.

101
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,346
It's a cinch that axe hasn't had
an edge on it in two months.

102
00:10:56,455 --> 00:11:00,289
And your tea can, a five-pound tea can
in your house is empty.

103
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,856
Your husband's been gone a long time.

104
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,726
Now, look here, Mr. Lane,
I don't think you have any right to...

105
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,459
I'm not talking about rights.
I'm talking about lies.

106
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,432
Why did you lie to me, Mrs. Lowe?

107
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:14,495
Were you afraid that maybe you wouldn't be
safe here with me with your husband away?

108
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,440
- That it?
- That's partly it.

109
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,903
Women always figure every man
comes along wants them.

110
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,836
- Mr. Lane.
- Yes, ma'am?

111
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,831
You're right. I was lying.
My husband is overdue.

112
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,410
He should have been home long ago.

113
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,342
Figure Apaches killed him?

114
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,176
Of course not.
There are a hundred possible explanations.

115
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:31,806
Indians are one of them.

116
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,249
But we're at peace with the Apache,
except for a few...

117
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,116
Mrs. Lowe, if you've got good sense...

118
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:39,123
you'll pack up you and that boy of yours
and come out with me.

119
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,625
There's trouble brewing
in the Apache lodges.

120
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:44,457
Vittorio, their main chief,
called a war council.

121
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,293
A full report of it is in that dispatch
I'm carrying.

122
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,335
But you don't know, we've always
gotten along splendidly with the Apache.

123
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,698
They drink and bring their horses
to our spring...

124
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,139
on their way north to the buffalo hunt.

125
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:01,641
I've never seen the great Vittorio,
but there've been plenty of Apaches here.

126
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:06,410
I've seen the great Vittorio,
before the treaty.

127
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,984
His horse had 40 scalps hung in its mane.

128
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,855
That was before the treaty.

129
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,428
We broke that treaty, us Whites.

130
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:22,927
There's no word in the Apache language
for lie, and they've been lied to.

131
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,169
If they rise, there won't be...

132
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,297
- a White left in the territory.
- They won't bother me.

133
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,238
Us, I mean. We always got along very well.

134
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,907
People I know, man and his wife,
got along real well for...

135
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,682
20 years. Then one day...

136
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,312
she upped and blew a hole in him...

137
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,979
big enough to drive a stagecoach through.

138
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,185
She got mad. The Apaches are mad.

139
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,725
Well, I have nothing to worry about,
I'm sure.

140
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,987
Nice to be sure.

141
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,700
Get out of the way.

142
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,434
- Strange dog you have.
- I don't have him.

143
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,842
- The two of you are together.
- He stays with me.

144
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,810
- He can smell an Indian at a half a mile.
- He smells Indians? I don't believe it.

145
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,812
Sure, lots of dogs smell Indians.
You can teach them.

146
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,248
Teach them? How?

147
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,946
First you get yourself a puppy and then...

148
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:19,682
you hire yourself a tame Indian
and cut a willow switch.

149
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,486
Then you get the Indian to beat the puppy...

150
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,892
with a willow switch four or five times
a day.

151
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:27,796
And when he grows up,
he'll always signal when he smells an Indian.

152
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,164
Beat a puppy. How cruel.

153
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,231
That's the way they do it.

154
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,703
Anyway, I don't believe
a dog can smell Indians.

155
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,968
I mean, as different from anyone else.

156
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,873
- You or me, for instance.
- Well, they can.

157
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,071
As a matter of fact,
Indians can smell White people.

158
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,478
- I don't believe it.
- Well, it's true.

159
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:48,381
I'm part Indian, and I can smell you
when I'm downwind of you.

160
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:55,460
- That's impossible.
- No, it isn't impossible, Mrs. Lowe.

161
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:07,695
You baked today.
I can smell fresh bread on you.

162
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,599
Sometime today you cooked with salt pork.

163
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,840
Smell that on you, too.

164
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,845
You smell all over like soap.

165
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,745
You took a bath. And on top of that,
you smell all over like a woman.

166
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:26,453
I could find you in the dark, Mrs. Lowe,
and I'm only part Indian.

167
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,728
Mrs. Lowe.

168
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,704
What do you want?

169
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:18,636
- I watered and grained the stock.
- Thank you.

170
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,845
I'll bed down near here someplace tonight.

171
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,610
Mr. Lane?

172
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,817
You can't sleep outside,
there's a storm coming.

173
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,427
I've fixed a pallet for you in the corner.

174
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,961
It would be uncivilized
to let anyone sleep outside...

175
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,540
and after all, we are civilized, aren't we?

176
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:52,201
Speaking for you, of course. But me?

177
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,173
I guess you could call me civilized.

178
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,846
That's your bed.
I'm sorry it has to be on the floor.

179
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:08,521
I have to set the batter for the morning.
I hope the noise won't disturb you.

180
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,156
It won't.

181
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,765
Good night, ma'am.

182
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,654
Put that gun down.

183
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,819
You're Hondo Lane, the gunman.

184
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,559
- I carry a gun.
- Don't come any nearer.

185
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,565
You killed three men in a gunfight last year.

186
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,138
- We heard about it. Three men.
- Yes, ma'am.

187
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:57,137
- Just as quick as I could.
- Don't come any nearer.

188
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,445
It's not a very good idea
to point one of these things at anybody...

189
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,039
with an empty chamber under the firing pin.

190
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:07,182
You can see it plain as day.

191
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,081
I keep it that way because of Johnny.

192
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:11,953
Well, now it's loaded.

193
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:15,388
Keep it that way, and keep it high.

194
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:30,138
Please stay. I really want you to.

195
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:35,574
I'm sorry. I should have realized from
the beginning that you are a gentleman.

196
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,353
Civilized? Gentleman?

197
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,221
Well, a lot for one day.

198
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,564
Night, ma'am.

199
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,018
Morning. Getting an early start.

200
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,085
Be sure and tell that little man
goodbye for me.

201
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,662
I ought to wake him to say goodbye to you.

202
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,821
Was it me, I'd let him sleep.

203
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:30,368
Youngsters grow sleeping,
but you do what you want to.

204
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,071
He was so delighted with that whistle
you made for him.

205
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:38,234
Glad to hear it. He and I got along just fine.

206
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:42,538
It's more like a flute than a whistle.
It ranges almost the full scale.

207
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:46,044
I learned to make them when I was
living with the Mescalero.

208
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:49,120
My squaw used to make them
for every kid in the lodge.

209
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:53,386
- You lived with the Apache?
- Five years.

210
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,356
- And you had an Indian wife?
- Wife, squaw...

211
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:02,232
I took the liberty of borrowing a few feet
of rope off of that coil in the lean-to.

212
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,999
- Gladly pay you for it, if you let me.
- 'Course not.

213
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,831
The hills are so beautiful today.

214
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,274
Odd how clear they always are
after a dust storm.

215
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:18,580
Must have been very interesting
living with the Apache.

216
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,181
I liked it.

217
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:25,747
- This Indian wife you have...
- Had. She's dead.

218
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,184
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up
an unhappy memory.

219
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:36,668
I can't remember anything unhappy
about Destarte.

220
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:41,596
Destarte? How musical. What does it mean?

221
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:47,779
You can't say it except in Mescalero.
It means morning.

222
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,242
But that isn't what it means, either.

223
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:55,919
Means more than just that.
Indian words mean the sound and...

224
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,083
feel of a word, like...

225
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,791
crack of dawn, the first bronze light...

226
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:05,455
that makes the buttes stand out
against the gray desert.

227
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,562
The first sound you hear of a brook...

228
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,362
curling over some rocks, with trout jumping.

229
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:15,597
It's like when you get up in the first light...

230
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:20,241
just you and her and you go out of
a wickiup.

231
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:25,678
Where it smells kind of smoky and private,
just you and her, and...

232
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,982
kind of safe with just the two of you.

233
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:31,655
Stand outside and...

234
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:35,786
feel the bite of the first wind
coming down from the high divide...

235
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,457
that promises snowfall.

236
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,227
Can't say it in English,
but that was her name.

237
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,764
Destarte.

238
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:53,267
- You remind me of her some.
- Of an Indian girl?

239
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,269
Was she fair?

240
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,914
Her hair was black as 10 feet down.

241
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,751
Did you ever see a crow's wing,
how black and gleaming it is?

242
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:04,048
- Yes.
- That's the way her hair shined.

243
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,949
I'd like to pay you for that rope.

244
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:10,085
Riding dispatch,
I have the right to give U.S. script.

245
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:14,321
- You loved her?
- I don't know.

246
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,964
I needed her.

247
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:25,169
- But if she was dark and I'm fair...
- Why you reminded me of her?

248
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,642
- Yes.
- I don't know.

249
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:31,110
I thought about it.
You don't look anything like her.

250
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,747
I am fully aware
that I am a homely woman, Mr. Lane.

251
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,343
I didn't mean that.

252
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:39,856
I have a bad habit of telling the truth.
But being pretty isn't much.

253
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,949
I know a lot of pretty people
I wouldn't trust...

254
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,153
with a busted nickel-plated watch.

255
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,491
But some others, something comes out of
the inside of them and...

256
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,930
you know you can trust them.

257
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,232
Destarte had that.

258
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,372
And you've got it, too.

259
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:03,014
- I'm a married woman.
- I thought about that, too.

260
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:06,380
I guess I kissed you
because you remind me of Destarte.

261
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,679
Or maybe it was because
I hate to think of your hair...

262
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:11,312
hanging from the center pole
of an Apache wickiup.

263
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,924
Well, a long time ago I made me a rule.

264
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,192
I let people do what they want to do.

265
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,666
Sam!

266
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,468
You are a strange man, Mr. Lane.

267
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,646
I don't know about that.
Goodbye, Mrs. Lowe.

268
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:51,086
- You are Vittorio.
- I am Vittorio.

269
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,420
Your horses have been watered here.

270
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,929
- You were told to go.
- I couldn't leave.

271
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:01,491
My husband is away,
and I didn't think that I...

272
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:08,601
Your people water their horses here.

273
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,675
You leave my mother alone.

274
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:53,514
Stop him! Stop him!

275
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:11,093
- I ain't scared of you.
- You're not fear Apache?

276
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,504
No.

277
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,707
He fear hurt to mother, but not that to self.

278
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:24,207
He brave. Like Apache boy.

279
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:35,750
Him now blood brother.
I call him Small Warrior.

280
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,556
Him belong Moon Dog Lodge,
Chiricahua Apache.

281
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:42,565
You care for him well.
You now mother Chiricahua warrior.

282
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,257
Live safely here.

283
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:50,135
I hope someday,
someone befriends your sons.

284
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,574
My sons are dead. White man kill them.

285
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:31,974
Figured your scalp would be hanging
in some Apache wickiup by now.

286
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,705
- Hi, Buffalo.
- Been making bets on it.

287
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:38,647
- You're sure a disappointment to me, Hondo.
- You like to win your bet.

288
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,745
I wore out some horses.

289
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,945
You wore out you while you was at it.
Here, let me get that.

290
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,956
Where's that water?

291
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,361
- Looks like I won a bet, Buffalo.
- Hi, Dick.

292
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,626
Yeah, I owe you a jug of red-eye.

293
00:28:55,734 --> 00:29:00,330
- This feels good.
- There's times when water is good.

294
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,568
That's exactly what I mean.

295
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,045
I say I got a right to talk to
this here bow-necked Major...

296
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,548
- I don't talk to no underlings.
- Major's asleep.

297
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,448
That's just too bad about him.
I'm a citizen and I want to see him.

298
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:17,646
Major ain't had any sleep for three days.

299
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,986
I can tell you everything
just as well as he can.

300
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,525
We ain't heard nothing from up north.

301
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:26,559
If you ask me, the Cavalry's scared of
Vittorio. I think the U.S. Cavalry...

302
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:30,259
I am greatly interested in your opinion of
the United States Cavalry.

303
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:32,598
Continue, Mr... Whatever your name is.

304
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:35,164
The Cavalry is supposed to support
the settlers.

305
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,002
I've got some cattle up north,
I don't intend...

306
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:40,805
C troop is making a sweep to the north
to escort out any settlers they may find.

307
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:45,843
C troop is now over a week late
in returning. That's all I can tell you.

308
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,016
C troop isn't coming back.

309
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,789
I'd be obliged, sir, if you would leave.

310
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:00,421
A fine business, the whole territory...

311
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:01,897
- Sergeant!
- Get!

312
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,699
Get out of the way, you mangy...

313
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:17,381
- lf that's your cur, get him out of the way.
- Walk around him.

314
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,749
I'll be hanged if I go out of my way
for any cur dog.

315
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:23,886
A man ought to do what he thinks is best.

316
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,001
Quit blocking the door.

317
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,699
Where did you get this?

318
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,004
- Half a day's ride south of Twin Buttes.
- How?

319
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,681
Took it off a couple of Indians, Apaches.

320
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,110
Running Dog Lodge of the Mescaleros.

321
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:56,512
Mescaleros are up, too.
That makes all the Apache lodges.

322
00:30:56,621 --> 00:31:01,422
Say, while I was south, did any settlers
get in from the north basin?

323
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,925
A few, the last couple of weeks.

324
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:06,019
Handsome woman, fair,
with a boy about six?

325
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,564
No, mostly middle-aged or elderly people.

326
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,291
Get some sleep, Lane, use my tent.

327
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:12,695
Thank you.

328
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:25,107
While you're sleeping,
I'll move your possibles over to my tent.

329
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:29,350
Pete Britton was scouting with C troop.

330
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:34,655
Wintered with old Pete once
up on the Divide. Ornery cuss.

331
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:37,794
Them indians you took that pennant offen.

332
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,829
- Dead Indians?
- Finally.

333
00:31:55,011 --> 00:31:56,911
- Hi, Pete.
- Hi, Hondo.

334
00:31:57,013 --> 00:31:59,140
Broke my heart when I heard you made it.

335
00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:02,412
Your pap know you started out
against this so-called whiskey?

336
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:03,884
I ain't seen him for a month.

337
00:32:03,987 --> 00:32:06,182
I know you haven't. Come here,
I got a message for you.

338
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:08,780
Leave him be, Hondo,
I can't make no money scouting.

339
00:32:08,892 --> 00:32:11,417
Aw, these other fellows'll excuse you.
Come on over at the bar.

340
00:32:11,528 --> 00:32:15,328
I won't. I'm out almost $100.

341
00:32:15,832 --> 00:32:18,995
- That figures, with Buffalo in the game.
- Wait a minute.

342
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,929
These shirts are hard to come by.

343
00:32:27,577 --> 00:32:29,909
- What'd you hit me for?
- 'Cause I know you.

344
00:32:30,013 --> 00:32:31,173
Leather it.

345
00:32:33,784 --> 00:32:35,547
No, don't leather it.

346
00:32:44,694 --> 00:32:47,162
No wonder them Apaches
call him <i>Emberato.</i>

347
00:32:47,264 --> 00:32:49,232
- What does it mean?
- Bad temper.

348
00:32:55,071 --> 00:32:56,971
I should've let him shoot you.

349
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,832
That's the second time I've tangled with
that mouthy no-good...

350
00:33:01,478 --> 00:33:04,811
- What's his name?
- Calls himself Lowe, Ed Lowe.

351
00:33:15,325 --> 00:33:16,485
Johnny.

352
00:33:22,699 --> 00:33:24,394
Johnny!

353
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,177
Mommy.

354
00:33:42,485 --> 00:33:45,818
Hi, Mommy.
Vittorio says I'll make a good Apache.

355
00:33:46,456 --> 00:33:50,153
I thought... I didn't know he was with you,
I didn't hear anything.

356
00:33:50,493 --> 00:33:53,189
- Apache no make noise.
- Look what he gave me.

357
00:33:53,296 --> 00:33:56,663
- It is lodge token. His.
- It's very pretty, thank you.

358
00:33:57,267 --> 00:33:58,700
He will ride well.

359
00:33:59,736 --> 00:34:01,226
And he no afraid.

360
00:34:02,372 --> 00:34:05,307
- I speak with your mother, go to house.
- Yes, Vittorio.

361
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:10,506
Lodge should have man.

362
00:34:11,114 --> 00:34:14,811
- My husband will be home any day now.
- I no think so.

363
00:34:15,185 --> 00:34:16,777
I think he dead.

364
00:34:23,927 --> 00:34:25,986
Small Warrior should have father.

365
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,571
See, Sergeant, just like I told you.

366
00:34:43,046 --> 00:34:46,379
That's my horse, all right.
Got my brand on it: "E.L." Ed Lowe.

367
00:34:46,483 --> 00:34:48,007
What he says true?

368
00:34:48,118 --> 00:34:50,712
- Yeah, that's his horse.
- Where'd you get him?

369
00:34:50,854 --> 00:34:54,017
From his ranch,
that's where I'm taking him back.

370
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,190
That's where he can pick him up.

371
00:34:56,293 --> 00:34:59,524
But that's Indian territory, strict orders
against any Whites going in there.

372
00:34:59,629 --> 00:35:03,725
You know something, Joe, I got a bad ear.
I can't hear a thing you're saying.

373
00:35:12,475 --> 00:35:14,409
Aren't you gonna prefer charges
against him?

374
00:35:14,511 --> 00:35:17,071
He may be a mean, ornery,
son-of-anything-you-wanna-call-him...

375
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,738
but he ain't no horse thief.

376
00:35:18,848 --> 00:35:21,908
And I'm not gonna call him one,
to his face or his back.

377
00:35:36,032 --> 00:35:37,499
You stay here.

378
00:35:51,915 --> 00:35:54,645
I thought the Apache were always silent.

379
00:35:54,951 --> 00:35:58,443
Not when they seek squaw. You pick one.

380
00:35:58,922 --> 00:36:00,014
What?

381
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,955
It's not good for Small Warrior...

382
00:36:02,058 --> 00:36:04,856
to be without father
to teach him how to be man.

383
00:36:06,696 --> 00:36:09,130
This is the one I was calling Emiliano.

384
00:36:09,632 --> 00:36:12,066
Very brave, has taken many scalps.

385
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:17,239
He has six horses, and two squaws,
but one old and will soon die.

386
00:36:20,477 --> 00:36:21,808
He's good hunter.

387
00:36:22,178 --> 00:36:23,873
Never hungry, his wickiup.

388
00:36:25,882 --> 00:36:28,112
This is one who is called Kloori.

389
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,981
He has ten horses, one squaw.

390
00:36:34,724 --> 00:36:37,659
Sachito, brave warrior, many horses.

391
00:36:39,362 --> 00:36:43,059
Not much beat squaws, sings very loud.

392
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:55,603
- Boy, go stand by my horse.
- Yes, Vittorio.

393
00:36:58,848 --> 00:37:02,443
Small Warrior never to see tears,
Apache does not weep.

394
00:37:03,153 --> 00:37:05,849
Chief, you can't make me do this,
I'm married.

395
00:37:05,955 --> 00:37:08,287
You are fool, your man dead.

396
00:37:08,425 --> 00:37:12,361
Soon come planting rain.
If your man come home by then, good.

397
00:37:12,495 --> 00:37:14,597
If not, you take Apache brave.

398
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:25,739
Remember, time of planting rain.

399
00:37:37,253 --> 00:37:39,118
He's getting kind of deep
into Indian territory.

400
00:37:39,222 --> 00:37:40,450
And so are we.

401
00:37:41,091 --> 00:37:43,855
What are you squawking for?
You're getting well paid.

402
00:37:44,394 --> 00:37:48,626
He'll be making camp pretty soon. Don't
get a chance at him then, we'll turn back.

403
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,565
Quiet, Sam, I hear them.

404
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,745
Come on, Sam.

405
00:38:44,587 --> 00:38:46,350
That's his camp, all right.

406
00:38:57,367 --> 00:39:00,131
Rifle's gone,
must be out looking for camp meat.

407
00:39:41,411 --> 00:39:44,972
- You're all right, you're not hurt bad.
- This tintype saved me.

408
00:39:53,556 --> 00:39:54,955
That did it.

409
00:39:55,558 --> 00:39:58,789
Now, every Apache between us
and the ranch will be alerted.

410
00:39:59,896 --> 00:40:01,557
They'll have us cut off.

411
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:04,729
No, there's nobody between us
and Fort Seddon.

412
00:44:24,794 --> 00:44:26,284
Beat it, Sam!

413
00:44:34,203 --> 00:44:36,933
- White man understand Apache.
- A little.

414
00:44:37,406 --> 00:44:39,306
He know now how he die.

415
00:44:39,575 --> 00:44:41,941
Your coup stick shows many scalps.

416
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:45,339
Yes, many. Soon, you.

417
00:44:45,515 --> 00:44:46,982
Man's scalp would look out of place there.

418
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:50,348
You took all yours from squaws,
papoose, and dogs.

419
00:44:52,855 --> 00:44:55,551
Your lodge should be real proud of you.

420
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,235
You will take long time die.

421
00:45:28,124 --> 00:45:30,058
Where are soldiers, White man?

422
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:32,559
- How many?
- I don't know, Vittorio.

423
00:45:32,662 --> 00:45:33,993
You know my name?

424
00:45:34,096 --> 00:45:37,361
I saw you once at the Treaty Council
at Fort Meade.

425
00:45:37,466 --> 00:45:38,558
The treaty.

426
00:45:48,044 --> 00:45:51,138
The treaty was like rustle of wind
to White man.

427
00:45:51,714 --> 00:45:56,151
- Now you tell, where are soldiers?
- This, I do not know.

428
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,383
- Hat. Soldier hat.
- I was once a soldier.

429
00:45:59,488 --> 00:46:01,581
Why you here Apache land?

430
00:46:02,491 --> 00:46:04,220
This is for me to know.

431
00:46:37,593 --> 00:46:40,892
I'm told you speak insults
to this one of my chiefs.

432
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,057
The cougar screams insults and is brave.

433
00:46:47,903 --> 00:46:51,600
A coyote howls insults and is a coward.

434
00:46:52,008 --> 00:46:53,475
We shall see.

435
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:56,570
Cougar or coyote.

436
00:46:57,546 --> 00:46:59,639
You will die bravely in silence...

437
00:47:00,082 --> 00:47:03,108
or you will wail
like woman bringing forth child...

438
00:47:03,586 --> 00:47:06,077
and cry out to us where pony-soldiers are.

439
00:47:56,839 --> 00:47:59,501
He claims the blood right, you understand?

440
00:47:59,909 --> 00:48:02,469
You mean, he says I shot his brother?

441
00:48:04,647 --> 00:48:05,807
I understand.

442
00:48:36,479 --> 00:48:39,039
So that life may ebb cleanly.

443
00:49:46,415 --> 00:49:49,748
Forget your blood right or join your brother.

444
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,831
You think you buy your life now?

445
00:50:13,742 --> 00:50:15,073
I don't think.

446
00:50:15,644 --> 00:50:18,169
You may live or die, we see.

447
00:51:10,299 --> 00:51:11,493
Indians.

448
00:51:35,858 --> 00:51:37,223
Is this your man?

449
00:51:37,693 --> 00:51:40,218
Speak, is this your man?

450
00:51:40,829 --> 00:51:44,060
- Yes, this is my husband.
- White man...

451
00:51:46,969 --> 00:51:49,403
you lived with the Apache, that's good.

452
00:51:49,972 --> 00:51:51,963
You know how Small Warrior
should be taught that...

453
00:51:52,074 --> 00:51:55,271
he be honored son of wickiup
of one who's called Vittorio.

454
00:51:55,377 --> 00:51:58,744
Watch like the hawk,
be patient as the beaver...

455
00:51:58,948 --> 00:52:01,473
brave as puma, that he may learn well.

456
00:52:01,917 --> 00:52:03,214
Know it, then...

457
00:52:03,552 --> 00:52:06,953
or your dying will be long before
you welcome death.

458
00:53:21,964 --> 00:53:23,932
- More coffee?
- No, thanks.

459
00:53:27,669 --> 00:53:30,604
- What are you gonna do?
- Gonna fix up your shirt.

460
00:53:31,407 --> 00:53:33,398
Not before I show you something.

461
00:53:40,482 --> 00:53:44,043
- Did Ed give you this?
- I took it off his body.

462
00:53:45,154 --> 00:53:46,416
He's dead.

463
00:53:49,124 --> 00:53:50,819
Tried to tell you before.

464
00:53:52,995 --> 00:53:54,724
Funny, I'm not surprised.

465
00:53:56,198 --> 00:53:59,429
Perhaps because I knew all along,
just wouldn't admit it to myself.

466
00:53:59,535 --> 00:54:02,265
- Hi, <i>Emberato,</i> you didn't die, did you?
- Hello, Johnny.

467
00:54:02,371 --> 00:54:03,395
Be careful.

468
00:54:03,505 --> 00:54:06,030
I wanna show you something, <i>Emberato.</i>
My Indian emblem.

469
00:54:06,141 --> 00:54:08,371
Vittorio gave it to me, didn't he, Mom?

470
00:54:11,246 --> 00:54:16,047
- He's taken a great liking to Johnny.
- Probably saved your life and mine.

471
00:54:16,585 --> 00:54:19,076
Indians place great value on male children.

472
00:54:19,354 --> 00:54:22,448
They also place a great value on dying well.

473
00:54:24,093 --> 00:54:25,685
Did Ed die well?

474
00:54:26,528 --> 00:54:28,393
I keep it under my pillow.

475
00:54:30,032 --> 00:54:31,192
He died well.

476
00:54:32,768 --> 00:54:35,999
When Johnny's old enough,
when he has to be told...

477
00:54:37,172 --> 00:54:38,764
it will make him proud.

478
00:54:39,308 --> 00:54:43,176
Here it is, <i>Emberato.</i> I'm a chief now.
Isn't it wonderful?

479
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:50,544
- Isn't it?
- Yes, Johnny.

480
00:55:26,355 --> 00:55:28,949
- Where's your mother?
- Picking watercress.

481
00:55:29,224 --> 00:55:31,658
- Any luck?
- Not a bite this morning.

482
00:55:32,995 --> 00:55:34,485
See where the sun is?

483
00:55:35,197 --> 00:55:37,290
- Up there.
- Yeah, on the back of your neck.

484
00:55:37,399 --> 00:55:38,991
You're casting a shadow.

485
00:55:39,101 --> 00:55:41,296
If you can see it, the fish can see it.

486
00:55:41,403 --> 00:55:44,964
Always fish with the sun in your face.
The other bank's the place.

487
00:55:45,107 --> 00:55:48,975
- That is, if you want my opinion.
- Gosh, <i>Emberato,</i> I want your opinion.

488
00:55:49,278 --> 00:55:50,836
But Mama won't let me go over there.

489
00:55:50,946 --> 00:55:52,880
- Why not?
- I can't swim.

490
00:55:53,949 --> 00:55:56,144
- You can't what?
- I can't swim.

491
00:55:56,285 --> 00:55:58,150
- How old are you?
- Six.

492
00:56:09,765 --> 00:56:14,259
- Help him, he can't swim.
- Time he learned. Everybody should swim.

493
00:56:16,271 --> 00:56:19,138
Just reach out in front of you
and grab a handful of water.

494
00:56:19,241 --> 00:56:20,936
Pull it back towards you.

495
00:56:23,545 --> 00:56:26,207
Not too fast. That's the way I learned.

496
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:34,516
- I did it, <i>Emberato,</i> I did it.
- Good.

497
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:37,283
- How will he get back?
- Swim.

498
00:56:37,459 --> 00:56:38,983
Well, he might drown.

499
00:56:39,461 --> 00:56:41,929
- Well, then, you go get him.
- I can't swim, either.

500
00:58:03,111 --> 00:58:04,601
Angie, there's...

501
00:58:05,547 --> 00:58:08,675
something I've got to tell you.
I tried to tell you.

502
00:58:09,418 --> 00:58:12,353
- And it isn't going to be easy.
- Then don't say it yet.

503
00:58:12,921 --> 00:58:14,479
Just look at the moon.

504
00:58:16,325 --> 00:58:18,418
How odd it looks in this quarter.

505
00:58:20,095 --> 00:58:23,861
When I was a child, my mother
used to tell me it was a teeter-totter.

506
00:58:25,701 --> 00:58:28,499
You know, the tilted plank a child plays on.

507
00:58:29,438 --> 00:58:31,872
I suppose the Indians have a word for it.

508
00:58:32,641 --> 00:58:35,075
Yeah, <i>bermarga.</i> It's the planting moon.

509
00:58:35,177 --> 00:58:38,010
Indians won't plant their corn
unless the moon's like that.

510
00:58:38,113 --> 00:58:40,707
You liked living with the Apache, didn't you?

511
00:58:41,316 --> 00:58:43,546
Angie, I've just got to tell you this.

512
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:45,777
I'm not much for lying.

513
00:58:45,921 --> 00:58:48,583
The last time I was here,
before Vittorio brought me?

514
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:49,657
Yes.

515
00:58:49,758 --> 00:58:53,421
I rode dispatch some after that,
then came to Seddon.

516
00:58:54,162 --> 00:58:55,493
There was trouble.

517
00:58:56,431 --> 00:58:57,693
I killed a man.

518
00:59:01,636 --> 00:59:04,366
Stay still. Somebody in those willows.

519
00:59:06,475 --> 00:59:08,067
Don't shoot, White man.

520
00:59:17,018 --> 00:59:19,680
Small Warrior has knife. He sleeps with it.

521
00:59:19,988 --> 00:59:22,047
- You were in the house?
- In house.

522
00:59:23,024 --> 00:59:26,653
Wickiup empty place without sons.
Mine empty wickiup.

523
00:59:27,162 --> 00:59:31,258
You better tell that brave back at
the creek bank not to walk in the water.

524
00:59:31,366 --> 00:59:33,630
I almost killed him a few minutes ago.

525
00:59:39,875 --> 00:59:41,638
Almost threw a shot at him.

526
00:59:41,877 --> 00:59:44,141
He very young. Will learn.

527
00:59:44,379 --> 00:59:47,007
- lf he lives.
- You are Apache.

528
00:59:48,216 --> 00:59:51,014
Now, hear me, pony-soldiers are near.

529
00:59:51,553 --> 00:59:55,580
Soon will be fought remembered fight.
They will come here first.

530
00:59:56,425 --> 00:59:59,690
- You will not go with them, White man.
- I will not.

531
01:00:00,028 --> 01:00:02,519
Leader of pony-soldiers will question you.

532
01:00:03,265 --> 01:00:06,291
You will say you have seen Apache
trailing to the west.

533
01:00:07,636 --> 01:00:09,069
This I won't do.

534
01:00:10,806 --> 01:00:13,070
- You will not?
- I will not.

535
01:00:15,677 --> 01:00:17,941
You have good man, treasure him.

536
01:00:26,188 --> 01:00:28,656
They're mounting up now
down by the butte.

537
01:00:28,757 --> 01:00:30,554
I don't hear a thing.

538
01:00:30,826 --> 01:00:32,589
There's eight of them I'd say,
or maybe nine.

539
01:00:32,694 --> 01:00:36,892
- There's something in those trees.
- That's a squirrel. Our talking woke him up.

540
01:00:36,998 --> 01:00:39,728
He's put out. There's nine of them.

541
01:00:40,602 --> 01:00:41,933
I love you.

542
01:00:44,506 --> 01:00:46,736
I suppose I shouldn't have said that...

543
01:00:46,842 --> 01:00:48,901
with my husband dead so short a time.

544
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:53,447
I don't guess people's hearts
got anything to do with a calendar.

545
01:01:04,059 --> 01:01:07,256
You were so wonderful,
refusing to lie for Vittorio.

546
01:01:08,029 --> 01:01:10,623
He was testing me. Indians hate lies.

547
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:14,427
And I guess I got to feel the same way...

548
01:01:15,303 --> 01:01:17,430
but, once in a while a fella's got to...

549
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:20,301
lie if it'll make it easier on someone else.

550
01:01:43,665 --> 01:01:45,963
Troop, halt!

551
01:01:49,204 --> 01:01:50,671
Prepare to dismount.

552
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,005
Dismount!

553
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:08,612
Madam and sir, may I present myself?
Lt. McKay, Troop D, 8th cavalry.

554
01:02:08,723 --> 01:02:11,749
- Hi, Hondo, you old cabin robber.
- Hi, Buff.

555
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:13,794
Lieutenant, this here is Hondo Lane.

556
01:02:14,129 --> 01:02:17,394
He's scouted some
and ridden dispatch some for the cavalry.

557
01:02:17,732 --> 01:02:21,224
- I don't reckon I know this here lady.
- This is Ms. Lowe, Lieutenant.

558
01:02:21,336 --> 01:02:23,327
You people are lucky. Obviously, Vittorio...

559
01:02:23,438 --> 01:02:26,236
and his renegade band
just happened not to find this hidden valley.

560
01:02:26,341 --> 01:02:28,639
- Vittorio's been here lots.
- And you lived?

561
01:02:28,743 --> 01:02:30,438
One lone man stood off Vittorio?

562
01:02:30,545 --> 01:02:33,742
No lone man stands off the Apache.
He lets us live here.

563
01:02:34,316 --> 01:02:36,807
There are almost 100 dead settlers
in the basin...

564
01:02:36,918 --> 01:02:38,886
scalped by this cowardly criminal.

565
01:02:38,987 --> 01:02:41,979
Vittorio may be a criminal by the books,
I don't know.

566
01:02:42,123 --> 01:02:44,557
But if he's a coward,
it hasn't showed up yet.

567
01:02:44,659 --> 01:02:46,786
- Amen, brother.
- I must disagree with you, Mr. Lane.

568
01:02:46,895 --> 01:02:48,795
He's run before us for 200 miles.

569
01:02:48,897 --> 01:02:51,695
Indians have a story
they tell their young ones...

570
01:02:52,033 --> 01:02:55,594
about a hunter who chased a wild cat
until he caught it.

571
01:02:55,704 --> 01:02:57,069
Then it was the other way around.

572
01:02:57,172 --> 01:02:59,436
The story goes back further than
the Indians.

573
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:03,033
It's originally attributed
to the first Roman army to enter Tartary.

574
01:03:03,144 --> 01:03:04,736
The soldier caught a Tartar and yelled out.

575
01:03:04,846 --> 01:03:07,280
The officer called back for him to come in
with his prisoner.

576
01:03:07,382 --> 01:03:09,714
And he replied, "The Tartar won't let me."

577
01:03:10,652 --> 01:03:12,586
That was one of the favorite stories
of Col. Mays...

578
01:03:12,687 --> 01:03:14,382
who teaches cavalry tactics at the Point.

579
01:03:14,489 --> 01:03:15,922
The story is world-wide.

580
01:03:16,024 --> 01:03:18,322
How long have you been out of that school,
Lieutenant?

581
01:03:18,426 --> 01:03:20,087
Graduated class '69, sir.

582
01:03:20,295 --> 01:03:21,819
This is '70, ain't it?

583
01:03:22,063 --> 01:03:26,090
I just can't seem to keep up with the years.
I meant to get a calendar, but then I forget.

584
01:03:26,201 --> 01:03:28,032
Say, who's President
of these United States now?

585
01:03:28,136 --> 01:03:29,160
Ulysses S. Grant.

586
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:32,501
You know, I voted once. I was down
in Independence around voting time.

587
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:36,270
And a fellow come up to me and offered me
$2 if I'd vote for a man named Taylor.

588
01:03:36,378 --> 01:03:37,868
And I was drinking...

589
01:03:38,013 --> 01:03:41,005
drinking a little at the time. And I...
The $2 didn't last...

590
01:03:41,116 --> 01:03:44,415
Mrs. Lowe, Mr. Lane, my orders are
to make a sweep as far as Twin Buttes.

591
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:47,488
My men'll bivouac here tonight.
We'll go on to Twin Buttes tomorrow...

592
01:03:47,589 --> 01:03:50,080
return tomorrow night to escort you
and your boy out to safety.

593
01:03:50,191 --> 01:03:54,150
If you'll excuse me, madam, I must
see that my men are properly encamped.

594
01:03:58,366 --> 01:04:00,561
Very nice and very young.

595
01:04:00,702 --> 01:04:03,034
He for doggone sure is, ma'am.

596
01:04:03,138 --> 01:04:06,437
- How long you been out on this patrol?
- This is the 20th day.

597
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:09,874
We've rounded up about eight families
back there, that's all there are left.

598
01:04:09,978 --> 01:04:12,037
We're gonna pick them up on the way out.

599
01:04:12,414 --> 01:04:14,177
There've been many a scalp took, Hondo.

600
01:04:14,282 --> 01:04:16,546
- You know where Vittorio is, don't you?
- I do.

601
01:04:16,885 --> 01:04:18,477
This boy Lieutenant's gonna get you killed.

602
01:04:18,586 --> 01:04:21,180
Us scouts has got to get
these young officers educated.

603
01:04:21,289 --> 01:04:23,780
Johnny, go in and set out the plates for me.

604
01:04:23,892 --> 01:04:26,087
Hondo, if your friend
would like to eat with us, Mr...

605
01:04:26,194 --> 01:04:28,321
Buffalo? Mr...

606
01:04:28,997 --> 01:04:31,557
I've known you for 8 or 10 years.
You must have a last name.

607
01:04:31,666 --> 01:04:34,396
Well, of course I got a last name,
what do you think I am?

608
01:04:34,502 --> 01:04:36,993
I know what you are,
but there's a lady present.

609
01:04:37,105 --> 01:04:40,268
Mrs. Lowe, my name is Baker.
That's what it is, Buffalo Baker.

610
01:04:40,375 --> 01:04:43,242
Well, you may eat with us then, Mr. Baker,
and wash.

611
01:04:43,344 --> 01:04:46,711
There's a basin on the bench
and a towel on the jug, and soap.

612
01:04:47,882 --> 01:04:50,476
You know, there is something
about this place...

613
01:04:50,585 --> 01:04:52,678
- I know what it reminds me of.
- My ranch.

614
01:04:52,787 --> 01:04:54,015
In California.

615
01:04:54,155 --> 01:04:57,147
I shot a deer right off your front porch
on a butte just like that.

616
01:04:57,258 --> 01:04:59,920
With a crick down below
and the mesas all spreading out.

617
01:05:00,028 --> 01:05:01,518
Made me pack it back.

618
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:06,826
- You have a place that looks like this?
- East of San Dimas.

619
01:05:07,535 --> 01:05:08,763
How wonderful.

620
01:05:13,074 --> 01:05:15,941
You're getting to where you kind of
take to that water.

621
01:05:16,044 --> 01:05:17,511
Every time I wash my face...

622
01:05:17,612 --> 01:05:20,843
I think of you and that night at Seddon's,
when you whacked me.

623
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:24,544
You busted off a jaw tooth, and it got to
hurting so bad I had to go to...

624
01:05:24,652 --> 01:05:26,620
the barber and have him dig out
the rest of it.

625
01:05:26,721 --> 01:05:29,485
Did I catch you that day,
I'd have set your sun.

626
01:05:29,791 --> 01:05:31,986
That's the last morning you'd ever seen.

627
01:05:32,093 --> 01:05:34,960
"Hondo Lane, first prize, Winchester Arms."

628
01:05:35,463 --> 01:05:39,524
Always liked this rifle of yours.
Always wanted one of the new issue myself.

629
01:05:39,834 --> 01:05:41,426
Keep your hands off it.

630
01:05:42,137 --> 01:05:45,038
I've known him 10 years, and he's never
spoken a friendly word to me.

631
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:47,438
- I don't like you.
- Figured that.

632
01:05:47,809 --> 01:05:50,573
But now I figure is how he might admire
to give me that rifle.

633
01:05:51,913 --> 01:05:55,110
You see, about a half day out of Seddon,
I come across some bodies.

634
01:05:55,216 --> 01:05:57,650
One of them was this here lady's husband.

635
01:05:58,353 --> 01:06:00,821
There was a lot of horse tracks
around there.

636
01:06:00,922 --> 01:06:03,356
Some of them belonged
to that there chestnut you were riding.

637
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:05,722
That one with the cast-off horseshoe.

638
01:06:06,594 --> 01:06:09,620
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice
little set-up you got yourself here.

639
01:06:09,731 --> 01:06:12,097
Nice ranch. Pretty woman.

640
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,430
You could get yourself killed talking like this.

641
01:06:14,536 --> 01:06:17,130
Or I could get that
new-fashioned Winchester...

642
01:06:17,238 --> 01:06:19,638
since he bushwhacked this lady's husband.

643
01:06:19,741 --> 01:06:22,107
Did she know that,
I figure she wouldn't look at him like...

644
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:25,577
he was the high cockalorum of every tribe
from here to Salt Water.

645
01:06:26,614 --> 01:06:27,774
Hondo.

646
01:06:45,366 --> 01:06:46,890
I tried to tell you.

647
01:06:50,171 --> 01:06:52,196
Mrs. Lowe, we're ready to leave.

648
01:06:52,807 --> 01:06:53,865
Mr. Lane?

649
01:06:54,542 --> 01:06:55,941
- Stridon.
- Yes, sir.

650
01:06:56,044 --> 01:06:58,638
- Form the troops, column of twos.
- Yes, sir.

651
01:07:00,181 --> 01:07:02,274
I want you to accompany us
as far as Twin Buttes.

652
01:07:02,383 --> 01:07:04,908
Haven't any time to lose,
so I'd be obliged if you'd saddle up.

653
01:07:05,019 --> 01:07:06,850
- I'm not going.
- You're not going?

654
01:07:06,955 --> 01:07:08,513
- That's right.
- But why?

655
01:07:08,623 --> 01:07:10,215
- Gave my word.
- Your word to whom?

656
01:07:10,325 --> 01:07:12,293
- Vittorio.
- Surely a word given to an...

657
01:07:12,393 --> 01:07:15,851
- Indian desperado wouldn't be...
- Mister, when I give my word, I keep it.

658
01:07:15,964 --> 01:07:17,522
Now I'll give you a piece of advice...

659
01:07:17,632 --> 01:07:20,192
there's only one family
between here and Twin Buttes...

660
01:07:20,301 --> 01:07:22,326
and you're too late to do them any good.

661
01:07:22,437 --> 01:07:26,396
So you better gather up what settlers
you have and hightail it out of here.

662
01:07:26,507 --> 01:07:29,601
Sir, I have my orders,
and these orders will be executed.

663
01:07:30,078 --> 01:07:31,136
Ma'am.

664
01:07:34,983 --> 01:07:36,348
Prepare to mount.

665
01:07:37,752 --> 01:07:39,242
Mount.

666
01:07:40,955 --> 01:07:42,786
Forward...

667
01:07:42,924 --> 01:07:43,982
ho!

668
01:07:54,802 --> 01:07:58,135
- Angie.
- I can't talk now. I have to think.

669
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,671
I'll put your things outside.

670
01:09:01,669 --> 01:09:05,002
- Before I go I want to explain something.
- Yes?

671
01:09:05,807 --> 01:09:08,332
It didn't happen in the low way you heard it.

672
01:09:08,743 --> 01:09:12,179
- I didn't bushwhack.
- I never for a moment thought you did.

673
01:09:12,914 --> 01:09:15,610
- But you killed him.
- I didn't have any choice...

674
01:09:15,717 --> 01:09:18,277
- he cut loose at me...
- I should have known that.

675
01:09:18,386 --> 01:09:21,878
I should have known you were lying
to make me think well of him.

676
01:09:22,023 --> 01:09:25,686
Poor Ed. I guess he wasn't the sort of man
to die well.

677
01:09:26,194 --> 01:09:27,923
Sorry now I hated him so much.

678
01:09:28,029 --> 01:09:31,089
I guess he couldn't help
being weak and selfish.

679
01:09:31,265 --> 01:09:34,029
- I just didn't have any choice.
- I know that.

680
01:09:38,473 --> 01:09:40,805
You're gonna feel differently about me?

681
01:09:41,376 --> 01:09:44,209
No one has any control
over the way they feel.

682
01:09:45,146 --> 01:09:47,979
I'm never going to change
the way I feel about you.

683
01:09:49,283 --> 01:09:50,409
But...

684
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:52,518
what about him?

685
01:09:58,292 --> 01:09:59,384
Yeah.

686
01:10:01,062 --> 01:10:03,724
Guess there are some things
that just can't...

687
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,695
He's gonna be a good man.

688
01:10:08,836 --> 01:10:12,863
Good spread to his shoulders.
Head works, too.

689
01:10:14,375 --> 01:10:18,937
Other night, after you went to sleep,
he crawled up into my bunk...

690
01:10:19,747 --> 01:10:21,647
and put his arms around my neck.

691
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:24,750
Made me feel kind of funny.

692
01:10:25,653 --> 01:10:27,450
Like he was depending on me.

693
01:10:28,389 --> 01:10:30,880
Lot of things I'd rather do than this.

694
01:10:31,059 --> 01:10:32,754
You're going to tell him?

695
01:10:33,194 --> 01:10:37,426
If I don't, somebody else will.
And I got a belly full of lies.

696
01:10:43,571 --> 01:10:45,698
Look what I got!

697
01:10:46,574 --> 01:10:49,338
- Hold him by the gills like I showed you.
- Sure.

698
01:10:50,778 --> 01:10:54,043
- Johnny, I want to tell you something.
- It's a nice perch, ain't it?

699
01:10:54,148 --> 01:10:56,343
Bass. Remember the shape of its head?

700
01:10:56,451 --> 01:10:59,477
Oh yeah, I forgot.
Bass have a jaw that stick out like this.

701
01:11:00,955 --> 01:11:02,889
What I wanted to tell you is...

702
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:05,356
while back, a man came at me with a gun.

703
01:11:05,693 --> 01:11:07,752
- I had to kill him.
- Good. Indian?

704
01:11:07,962 --> 01:11:10,988
No, he was a white man, Johnny,
but I didn't have any choice. He...

705
01:11:12,967 --> 01:11:16,733
I told you to press down on the shank,
and then you won't stick yourself.

706
01:11:17,038 --> 01:11:18,596
Won't break the hook, either.

707
01:11:19,774 --> 01:11:23,039
Here, bite down on this stick.
That's the way Indian youngsters...

708
01:11:23,144 --> 01:11:24,975
learn not to cry.

709
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:35,088
- Johnny, this man I killed...
- No!

710
01:11:37,825 --> 01:11:41,955
Your ranch in California,
it's far, too far for gossip to travel.

711
01:11:43,331 --> 01:11:45,822
Go wrap your thumb
in some bayberry leaves.

712
01:11:47,935 --> 01:11:49,903
You and your silly ideals.

713
01:11:50,505 --> 01:11:53,030
You think truth is the most important thing.

714
01:11:53,241 --> 01:11:55,402
- It's the measure of a man.
- Not for a woman.

715
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:58,809
A man can afford to have noble sentiments
and poses.

716
01:11:59,113 --> 01:12:02,173
But a woman only has the man she marries.
That's her truth.

717
01:12:02,283 --> 01:12:04,751
And if he's no good, that's still her truth.

718
01:12:04,852 --> 01:12:07,844
I married a man who was a liar,
a thief, and a coward.

719
01:12:07,989 --> 01:12:10,014
He was a drunkard and unfaithful.

720
01:12:10,124 --> 01:12:13,821
He only married me to get this ranch, and
then he deserted Johnny and me for good.

721
01:12:13,928 --> 01:12:16,226
And that's your fine truth for you.

722
01:12:16,697 --> 01:12:20,064
- Could I bring Johnny up on that?
- No, I guess you couldn't.

723
01:12:20,168 --> 01:12:22,363
And then you come along
and you're good and fine...

724
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:24,938
and everything that Ed
could never hope to be.

725
01:12:25,072 --> 01:12:29,031
And now, with your vanity, you want to spoil
Johnny's chances, and mine?

726
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:38,844
<i>- Varlebena.</i>
- What?

727
01:12:39,287 --> 01:12:42,484
When the Indians wind up their
squaw-seeking ceremony...

728
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:45,582
they only say one word: <i>Varlebena.</i>

729
01:12:46,093 --> 01:12:47,583
It means forever.

730
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:53,867
Forever.

731
01:13:18,593 --> 01:13:22,120
Well, we caught the wild cat.
Give us a hand, will you?

732
01:13:28,069 --> 01:13:30,196
I can't understand,
we killed him on the last charge.

733
01:13:30,304 --> 01:13:31,293
Vittorio?

734
01:13:31,606 --> 01:13:32,595
They had us surrounded.

735
01:13:32,707 --> 01:13:34,334
Could've cut us to pieces,
then they withdrew.

736
01:13:34,442 --> 01:13:36,842
That's why they pulled out.
Anytime their leader is killed...

737
01:13:36,944 --> 01:13:38,502
that means their medicine's bad.

738
01:13:38,613 --> 01:13:40,945
- This poor child.
- We're going out with this troop.

739
01:13:41,048 --> 01:13:42,675
- Vittorio's dead.
- No, he can't be.

740
01:13:42,783 --> 01:13:45,411
Everybody gets dead, it was his turn.
Now get your possibles.

741
01:13:45,519 --> 01:13:46,747
I have some medicine in the cabin.

742
01:13:46,854 --> 01:13:47,821
Thank you, Mrs. Lowe, I'd be...

743
01:13:47,922 --> 01:13:50,015
eternally grateful
if you'd pass among the men first.

744
01:13:50,124 --> 01:13:51,682
No, you're wounded,
I'm going to fix you up.

745
01:13:51,792 --> 01:13:54,352
Thank you, ma'am.
The men are in worse shape than I am.

746
01:13:54,462 --> 01:13:57,158
Come on, do as he says.
We'll take care of him.

747
01:13:59,033 --> 01:14:00,466
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir?

748
01:14:00,668 --> 01:14:02,033
Dismount the men.

749
01:14:02,169 --> 01:14:04,603
- Hitch their horses up to the wagon.
- Yes, sir.

750
01:14:04,705 --> 01:14:06,696
You'll find harness in the barn.

751
01:14:08,909 --> 01:14:10,035
Len.

752
01:14:11,545 --> 01:14:14,673
- What do you want?
- Take four men and gather the settlers.

753
01:14:14,782 --> 01:14:17,546
We'll probably catch up with you
at Errad Crossing.

754
01:14:18,953 --> 01:14:21,421
Wilson, McGrath, Lyon, Johnson.

755
01:14:23,858 --> 01:14:25,917
- How is he?
- He'll make out.

756
01:14:26,027 --> 01:14:28,222
Don't know much. Led us into an ambush.

757
01:14:28,329 --> 01:14:32,265
But I ain't ashamed of him nohow.
Bullet holes are in the front of him.

758
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,561
All those youngsters from the Point
are like that.

759
01:14:34,669 --> 01:14:36,034
They got to learn.

760
01:14:36,237 --> 01:14:38,330
Partly they learn, partly they die.

761
01:14:38,539 --> 01:14:40,439
But I gotta float my stick same as you.

762
01:14:40,541 --> 01:14:43,203
I never saw one of them
I had to be ashamed of.

763
01:15:14,041 --> 01:15:15,941
Join in and keep moving.

764
01:15:18,546 --> 01:15:20,411
Move it along, there!

765
01:15:20,815 --> 01:15:22,043
Hurry up!

766
01:15:29,390 --> 01:15:31,551
Come on, move along here!

767
01:15:54,782 --> 01:15:56,374
Come on, hurry it up.

768
01:16:10,664 --> 01:16:12,325
Circle the wagons!

769
01:16:15,069 --> 01:16:16,434
Wheel her around.

770
01:16:21,175 --> 01:16:22,836
Hold on!

771
01:16:49,170 --> 01:16:52,037
Stay in the wagon.
Keep everybody in the wagons.

772
01:16:52,139 --> 01:16:53,436
And don't unhitch.

773
01:17:22,803 --> 01:17:24,031
Hondo!

774
01:17:24,705 --> 01:17:27,902
All this circle's doing is protect the horses.
We gotta turn some wagons over.

775
01:17:28,008 --> 01:17:30,476
And stay here? That's what they expect.

776
01:17:30,611 --> 01:17:32,010
We gotta do what they don't expect.

777
01:17:32,112 --> 01:17:34,774
That's why all the heavy artillery's
in Buffalo's wagon.

778
01:17:34,882 --> 01:17:36,349
Buffalo!

779
01:17:38,986 --> 01:17:42,513
Lieutenant, get down. Are you ready, Buff?

780
01:17:42,623 --> 01:17:45,148
- I was born ready.
- Let's go.

781
01:18:51,892 --> 01:18:53,450
Circle the wagons.

782
01:18:54,194 --> 01:18:55,161
Close up.

783
01:19:40,074 --> 01:19:41,701
Stay down!

784
01:19:41,809 --> 01:19:42,867
Sergeant!

785
01:20:05,633 --> 01:20:09,330
- I don't want to be an Apache, Mama.
- Now, you be quiet.

786
01:20:09,436 --> 01:20:12,530
We're going to get out all right.
Now, help me, hurry.

787
01:20:22,383 --> 01:20:26,479
- Ready again, Buff?
- As I told you, I was born ready.

788
01:21:04,725 --> 01:21:05,953
Throw me your knife.

789
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:18,631
Get out of here!

790
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:27,671
All right, Hondo!

791
01:22:30,110 --> 01:22:31,407
They're not following.

792
01:22:31,512 --> 01:22:33,912
Leader's dead.
They'll powwow and pick a new one.

793
01:22:34,014 --> 01:22:37,814
- We're out of trouble if we get a move on.
- And am I going to get to drive?

794
01:22:37,918 --> 01:22:41,410
Before we get to San Dimas,
you'll be a top teamster, son.

795
01:22:45,459 --> 01:22:47,393
- How are you, Lieutenant?
- Fine, thanks to you.

796
01:22:47,494 --> 01:22:51,521
And you're all right, thanks to Lennie.
He shot that Indian offen your back.

797
01:22:51,765 --> 01:22:53,460
- Thanks.
- With your rifle.

798
01:22:53,734 --> 01:22:55,065
It's his.

799
01:22:55,369 --> 01:22:58,236
Don't look like we'll be needing it
much more today.

800
01:23:01,308 --> 01:23:04,505
General Crook will be here
within a month with a large force.

801
01:23:04,645 --> 01:23:07,910
- That'll be the end of the Apache.
- Yeah.

802
01:23:09,049 --> 01:23:10,539
End of a way of life.

803
01:23:11,652 --> 01:23:13,643
Too bad, it's a good way.

804
01:23:14,054 --> 01:23:16,181
Wagons forward!
