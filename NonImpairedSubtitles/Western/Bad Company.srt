1
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,000
One to the right, one to the left.

2
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,400
Let me go! Let me go!

3
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,400
Let me go! Let me go!

4
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,600
Take it easy.
The army'll make a man outta you.

5
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,800
Get on!

6
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,600
One man around the back.

7
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Your boy was supposed to report
for conscription. He never showed up.

8
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,200
It isn't right.
This family's done its part.

9
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
We lost our eldest at Chickamauga.

10
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,800
Sergeant, look.
This is all that's left of him.

11
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,800
Hasn't this family sacrificed enough?

12
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Well, I'm sorry, ma'am,
but the law says

13
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,400
that every able-bodied man
has got to join up.

14
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,200
I just have to do my job.

15
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
He isn't here. I swear it.

16
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,200
- No sign of him, Sergeant.
- Davis?

17
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,800
All right, search the barn...
and don't forget the privy.

18
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,200
If I find him, ma'am,
he just goes into the army.

19
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,400
If somebody else does, they're
liable to hang that boy of yours.

20
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,200
Stay put till I tell you. They may
come back and look some more.

21
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,600
Ma? Did they get Fred Chennelworth?

22
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,400
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

23
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,000
- Drew!
- I'm sorry.

24
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,200
It's all right. They're gone.

25
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,200
Now...
We ain't got any time to waste.

26
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,600
When you hit St Joe, book on the
first wagon train to Virginia City.

27
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,400
Once you're out of the Union,
the army can't get you. Now, here...

28
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,800
This is $100. It's all I could get.

29
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
- Joe!
- I don't need all that.

30
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,800
Just take it.
And write regular, hear?

31
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,600
You keep in touch.
Once this blasted thing is over,

32
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,800
why... we'll see you then.

33
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,400
Yes, sir.

34
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,000
Well...
I guess I better go saddle up Dinah.

35
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,200
Give me this. What a mess!

36
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Don't know the first thing
about packing, do you?

37
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,200
I don't know what you're gonna do
without your poor mother to...

38
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,800
- Ma...
- Now, Drew, when you get to a town,

39
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,200
you seek out the Methodist church,

40
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,000
and you ask the preacher
where you can find a good cheap meal.

41
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,600
Most likely, he'll direct you.
Methodists know food.

42
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,200
That's your father.

43
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
- Goodbye, Son.
- Bye, Ma.

44
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Wait a minute.

45
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,600
Take this. And don't ever forget
your precious brother.

46
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,400
Don't ever forget him.

47
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,200
September 30th 1863.

48
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,600
Arrived in Saint Joseph, Missouri,
after an uneventful trip.

49
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,600
I have found clean lodgings
in a respectable hotel

50
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,600
and will book passage
on a wagon train west,

51
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,800
where I hope to flourish
in my career.

52
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,800
The sun is shining - a suitable sign
for my high expectations.

53
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,200
Excuse me, sir.
Is this line for the wagon train?

54
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,200
Thank you.

55
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,000
Mornin'.

56
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
- Hey, you!
- Me?

57
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,200
- You new in town?
- Yes.

58
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,600
What you runnin' from? I saw you
there with them recruiting boys.

59
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,200
- I don't know what you mean.
- Hey, I'm in the same boat.

60
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
- Oh, yeah?
- Not that I'm runnin'.

61
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,600
I done a year with 'em.
God damn their miserable souls.

62
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,400
I locked horns with this sergeant -
big tubby bastard named Egan.

63
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Time and time again, he had me
pulling shit-sweeping details.

64
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,200
One fine day, I broke his nose.

65
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,400
I been running from 'em ever since,
the whole kit 'n' caboodle of 'em.

66
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,200
- Well, excuse me...
- Where you headed?

67
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,200
- Virginia City.
- Gonna be a silver baron, huh?

68
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,200
- How are you getting there?
- Wagon train.

69
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,000
Not unless you stick around
for six months.

70
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,400
- Six months?
- That's the waiting list.

71
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Them army boys won't nod politely
every morning, neither.

72
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,400
- What about the stagecoach?
- It's worse.

73
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,400
And the riverboats, they're all
plugged up account of the war.

74
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,000
- Say, you got that kinda money?
- Well...

75
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,600
You better be careful.
This town's the armpit of America.

76
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Man'll rob you blind
soon as look at you here.

77
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,600
You don't know where
to find a Methodist church, do you?

78
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
Why... Why, yes, sir. I do.

79
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,200
As a matter of fact,
I know a short cut. Right this way.

80
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,400
- Are you a Methodist yourself?
- Not exactly.

81
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Right here. Right here.

82
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,200
Here, stop that this minute!
Get off of him! You big bully!

83
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,800
Poor baby. There, there...

84
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,800
Wha?!

85
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,800
85 cents! That's something!

86
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,600
- Who is it?
- I'm Drew Dixon, ma'am, from Ohio.

87
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
What happened to you?

88
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,000
I been hit over the head
and robbed, ma'am.

89
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,000
I bet it was the same as robbed me.

90
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't know
what's become of this town.

91
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Come on in.

92
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,400
Parson Clum's home is always open
to the Christian traveller.

93
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,200
Thank you, ma'am.

94
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,400
All right, I got $10 in change.
What about the rest of you?

95
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
I'm clean, Jake. Loney's got it.

96
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,200
I swear, you're about the biggest
tattletale I ever saw.

97
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,400
Two dollars and some cents.

98
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,600
That's all.

99
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,400
- Simms?
- I got two dollars and... no cents.

100
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
- Just like you, Simms.
- Huh?

101
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,400
- Put it in the pile.
- Hey, I been thinkin'.

102
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,200
Maybe we shouldn't hit the trail
with the bad weather coming.

103
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,600
Ah, if it was left to you, we'd be
talking till we was six feet under.

104
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,800
- We go now. Right, Jake?
- Wrong, you little pissant.

105
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,600
How far we gonna get on ten dollars?
We need more ante.

106
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,000
Here, let me see that.

107
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,800
"Reverend and Mrs R Clum,
Kervin Street."

108
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,200
She'll be happy
to get her purse back.

109
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Reckon about two dollars' worth.

110
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,600
- There, now.
- Thank you, ma'am.

111
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,800
Well, just make yourself at home

112
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,800
while I take the Reverend's lunch
to the church.

113
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
When I come back,
we'll fix you up a good hot meal.

114
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,800
I won't be but a few minutes.

115
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,000
Get back here! Get back here!

116
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
Give me back my boot!

117
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Give me my boot!

118
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,200
- Give me back my money.
- You son of a bitch!

119
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,200
Let go!

120
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,600
Now, just hold on. I wanna talk.

121
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,000
Now, listen to me!

122
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
I wanna talk to you!

123
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,600
Listen to me!

124
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,000
Ah! Ow!
All right! All right! All right!

125
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
I'll give it back. I'll give it back.

126
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,400
Jesus, I'm bleeding!
Probably poisoned.

127
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,800
You just give me back my darn money.

128
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,000
Now, let's you and me have a talk.

129
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,000
You liar!

130
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,200
Goddamn, boy!
You're gonna wear me out.

131
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,200
Look, let's talk!

132
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,200
No!

133
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,400
- You're a real tiger, ain't you?
- My money!

134
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,400
God, I never heard so much fuss
about a couple o' dollars!

135
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,400
Listen!

136
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,600
Now, listen.

137
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,000
You got as much chance of gettin'
on a wagon train as a dead nigger.

138
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,800
You stick around here,
the army's gonna get you.

139
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,200
You can't go it alone. There's
outlaws, Indians, all them things.

140
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,200
Now... There's safeties in numbers,
if you heard of that.

141
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,400
It just so happens,
I'm heading west myself...

142
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,600
me and some others,
hand-picked for gumption...

143
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,600
which you got.

144
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,200
So, less'n you're dumber
than I think,

145
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
you'll throw in with us.

146
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,400
- What?!
- We started on the wrong foot

147
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,400
- but that don't mean nothin'.
- Drew? Drew?

148
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,800
- Well...
- Wait!

149
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,800
I feel like I'm running barefoot
in horseshit.

150
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,200
You ain't got much choice now, pard.

151
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,800
They'll be after you
with tar and feathers.

152
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
- Where's your stuff?
- Delesseps Hotel.

153
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,200
You're paying to sleep?!
You got a lot to learn,

154
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,200
and your first lesson is a drummer's
farewell - out the back window.

155
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,600
Hey, c'mon!

156
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,200
All right... Now...
Give me back my money.

157
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,600
- What?
- The money you stole off me.

158
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,600
- Didn't I give that back to you?
- No.

159
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,200
- How much was that?
- $7 and 85 cents.

160
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,000
- Coulda swore it was five.
- Uh-uh.

161
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Well, we'll call it seven even.

162
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,000
One, two, three... And how much was
that hotel room? Two dollars, right?

163
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,200
Four, five, six...
One dollar for me, and we're even.

164
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,600
- Well, how do you figure that?
- Well, I saved you two dollars.

165
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,600
I keep one,
and you're still a dollar ahead.

166
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Boy, you're lucky you fell in with us.

167
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,200
Yes, sir. We'll have us some high
old times, hunting and fishing.

168
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,200
That's our racket, living off the land.

169
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,400
Whoo! Well, call me a chink.

170
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,000
I ain't introduced myself. Jake
Rumsey, Pennsylvania bred and born.

171
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,400
- Drew Dixon.
- Pleased to meet you, Drew.

172
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Boys, meet Drew Dixon here.
I got him to throw in with us.

173
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,600
Drew here's raised by the ragtail
and the bobtail. Right, Drew?

174
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,600
Oh, well...
That's near the truth, I s'pose...

175
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,800
Yeah, Drew here's
dodging the army of the Potomac.

176
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,400
Aw, hell. Don't take on.
We gotta lay our cards on the table.

177
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,600
That's the Logan brothers,
Jim Bob and Loney.

178
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,000
- They're runnin' from the same.
- Oh, is that right?

179
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,200
Hell, we had the whole militia
of Illinois chasing us, didn't we?

180
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,800
When are you gonna stop flapping
your jaw, damn it?

181
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,400
- Howdy, Dixon.
- This here is Arthur Simms.

182
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,600
- He's running from his pa.
- Pleased to know you.

183
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,400
Here, junior. Wet your whistle.

184
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,200
That piece o' peckerwood's
Boog Bookin. He's barely off the tit.

185
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,400
- How old are you, Boog?
- Eleven.

186
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,800
- He's ten.
- Go to hell, you shit-toed bastard!

187
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,600
How'd you do on that lady's purse?

188
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,800
Well, the ways
of the Lord are strange.

189
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,400
- Meaning what?
- Meaning it just didn't pan out.

190
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,800
Well, what are we gonna do now?

191
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,200
We got about enough
for beans and coffee.

192
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,600
Well, we just go out
and get more, that's all.

193
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,000
Come here a minute.

194
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,800
- Loney, don't preach no sermons!
- Just hold your horses.

195
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,600
Now, lookee here. This new boy,
how do we know he's worth spit?

196
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,800
- Take my word for it.
- That don't mean nothin'.

197
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,600
What should he do, Loney?
Shoot a hole in a gold piece?

198
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,400
We need more money, right?
Let's see him go and get it.

199
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,600
I mean, that's fair, ain't it?

200
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,400
September 30th 1863.

201
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,600
My plans have changed somewhat.
I've fallen in with some rough types,

202
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,400
but it seems the only way
to get out west,

203
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,800
where I can find my fortune
and make my parents proud.

204
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,400
I resolve never
to do a dishonest act,

205
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,400
nor take part in any thievin',
robbin' or false undertakin'.

206
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,200
I will keep to the straight
and narrow, so help me God.

207
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,600
It is still a sunny day.

208
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,600
What the hell happened to you?

209
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,200
Boys, just don't
go near that hardware store.

210
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,000
- It's nearly hell.
- What happened?

211
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,200
Well, I edged on in there,
and I seen where they kept the money.

212
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,800
Now, there wasn't a soul around.
I reached in the till, and...

213
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
- There's $12!
- Shh!

214
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,400
Then this big galoot come chargin'
at me with a knife. See what he did?

215
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,600
- Did you shoot him?
- No!

216
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,400
Hell, I didn't want to pull a crowd.
I broke my hand, though.

217
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,200
Well, I knocked him out cold
and here I am.

218
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,600
What did I tell you?
Isn't this boy a wildcat? Whoo!

219
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,400
- I'm hungry.
- You deserve some chow.

220
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,200
- Come on. Let's get that chow!
- My favourite dinner. Dessert.

221
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,200
All right. Slow down, Boog.
You'll live longer.

222
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,800
First piece is for ol' Drew,
'cause he took the chances.

223
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,600
Next piece is for me.

224
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,000
$25 - that'll do fine.
Simms, give me that list.

225
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,600
Now, Drew...

226
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,600
when you go back into town to get
your horse, pick up these items.

227
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,200
See if you can jew 'em down
on the price a little.

228
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,600
Hey, this is mighty good.

229
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,600
Boys, this time tomorrow,
we'll be out on our lonesome.

230
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,400
Bein' leader,
I say we set some rules before we go.

231
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,200
- Meaning who takes what watch.
- Watch?

232
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,200
- What are we watching for?
- Indians, mostly.

233
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,200
What? You said there weren't
no hostile Indians anywhere near.

234
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
You told me that!

235
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,200
Remember when we met?
You says, "Come along, then."

236
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,800
I says, "Is there Indians?"
He said, "Hell, no."

237
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,600
He told you that? OI' Jake?
He must've had his fingers crossed...

238
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,000
'Cause we're crossing
the hunting ground for the O-sage

239
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,200
and the Cherokee
and the Pawnee and the Arapaho.

240
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,600
You're just joshing, ain't you,
Loney? I wish you wouldn't.

241
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,800
They hate to catch
white men on their hunting ground.

242
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,200
You know the Arapaho?
They're the nicest bunch.

243
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,000
- You know what they do?
- No.

244
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,200
First, they cut your pecker off.

245
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,600
- Then they feed it to you.
- Then they kill you.

246
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,600
Drew, they're lying, ain't they?
You know that ain't so, right?

247
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,600
Oh, well, Arthur, man's
got to have courage to spare

248
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,200
before he goes striking off
in the wilderness

249
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,600
to face the dangers and perils
that might befall us.

250
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,200
I mean, I ain't a-building
myself up, y'understand,

251
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,000
but take that mad dog
at the hardware store.

252
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,200
Now, if I hadn't sensed he was
behind me and had the courage to...

253
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,000
What is it? What is it?

254
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,400
I'm gonna get you!

255
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,800
- He's on my dick!
- I'll get him for you!

256
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,800
I think you killed him.

257
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
You did kill him.

258
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Damn it!

259
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,400
- All right, Boog.
- Oh, c'mon, Jake. It ain't time yet.

260
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,600
Boog.

261
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
'Night, Drew. Glad you're with us.

262
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,000
Goodnight, Boog.

263
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,400
Boys, take your last look at the USA.

264
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,800
- Do you mind if I say something?
- No.

265
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You're a damn fool
to go diggin' for silver.

266
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,800
- Tell me that when I strike it rich.
- Oh, bull.

267
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
- Ain't one in a million does that.
- Well, maybe that one'll be me.

268
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,200
Suit yourself. C'mon! Quit lagging!

269
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,800
God damn it, Boog!
That's the fourth time!

270
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I can't help it.
It's all this bouncing up and down.

271
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,000
Damn near a day gone,
we ain't covered ten miles.

272
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,400
What time do you make it? Four?

273
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,600
It's, er... 3.45.

274
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,000
Hey, that's some timepiece.
Is that gold?

275
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,400
Uh-huh. It belonged to my brother.

276
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,600
Hey, let me see that.
I'm not gonna bust it.

277
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,600
Whoo! Fancy Dan watch like that!

278
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,200
Good with your fists, too.
That stunt at the hardware store?

279
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:12,400
I'll be honest - I don't know nobody
'cept me that coulda done that.

280
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,800
Look, why don't you come
to Virginia City?

281
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,200
- Oh, no. I got plans of my own.
- Well, suit yourself.

282
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,800
Thanks for the invite, though.
Come on! It's already 3.45!

283
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
There it goes!

284
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
He's a heavy one, ain't he?

285
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,200
He oughta be.
Must have about 40 rounds in him.

286
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:14,000
Didn't I say we'd live off the land?
Clean him, Boog. I'm hungry.

287
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,600
You don't know how, do you?

288
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Well, somebody do it.

289
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,000
Oh, for the love of Jesus!
Can't anyone clean a rabbit?

290
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:37,200
Give it here. Damn! I'm the only boy
who gets the job done around here.

291
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,200
Dad-blamed babies. I'll have to cut
your meat for you, too.

292
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,400
It's the easiest damned thing
in the world.

293
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,200
Just slit this on back here.

294
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
Pull this on back.

295
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,200
Tough one, this bastard.

296
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,800
You gotta cut this off here...

297
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
Snap that off...

298
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,600
Then you gotta...
You gotta slit this up here.

299
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,200
There you go.

300
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,200
Dinner.

301
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,200
"From somewhere
in the upper recesses of the house,

302
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,600
"there came an unearthly shriek.

303
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,400
"The scream was that of a woman,
though what creature

304
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,000
"whom life's vicissitudes had driven
to that pitiful outcry,

305
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,600
"I could not say.

306
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,200
"Fearful, I went to the drawing room,

307
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,000
- "where I had..."
- What's a drawing room?

308
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,800
Maybe it's where
you practise your fast draw.

309
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,400
Oh, no, no. Boog, a drawing room
is like a parlour.

310
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,200
- That's what they used to call it.
- Everybody satisfied?

311
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
Get back to that screamin' gal.

312
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,400
"...reading to her father.
Mr Rochester, however..."

313
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,200
- We had a parlour once.
- Bullshit.

314
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,600
You never ate more than one meal
outta the same plate.

315
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,800
Oh, yeah? Shows all you know.

316
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,200
We had a dining room, parlour,
the whole damn rig-out.

317
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,800
I remember now. It was when
I was little, 'fore we lost the farm.

318
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Oh, that must've been hard luck.

319
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,400
No, sir. Then come the best time
in my whole life.

320
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,400
Me and Pa travelled around.
We had us this nigger, OI' Dan.

321
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,200
Pa made up this deal.
When we got to a town,

322
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,800
he'd find some idiot farmer
and then sell him our nigger.

323
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,800
Then come nightfall, Pa and me would
sneak out and steal him back again.

324
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,400
Before they missed him, we'd be on
to the next town. My pa thunk it up.

325
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,600
- Pretty smart, ain't it?
- How come you still ain't doing it?

326
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,200
Well, one day,
OI' Dan shot my pa dead.

327
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,400
- He did?
- Yep.

328
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,600
- Just like that?
- Somehow he got the drop on Pa.

329
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Do I have to hear about some nigger?
Tell us who was yelling at Jane.

330
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,800
Well, tell me later, Boog.
I'd like to hear it.

331
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You're a gentleman.
Not like Jake Rumsey,

332
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,800
who'd rather hear some dumb
horseshit about drawing rooms...

333
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,600
- If you knew my pa, you'd...
- Boog!

334
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,000
"Mister Rochester, however,
was no longer in his chair.

335
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,600
"In haste, I passed quickly through
the room in my anxiety to find him,

336
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,800
"but he was neither in his chambers
nor in the hall.

337
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
"I had to consider whether my duty
lay in remaining with the child..."

338
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,600
Believe me, boys, the worst idea
in the world is to go west.

339
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
- Come on, now.
- I ain't lying, son.

340
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,200
We tried farming. The first year,
a twister wiped us out.

341
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,200
The next year, it was the cattlemen,
then just pure de-rotten soil.

342
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,400
Nobody got no money.
Even if you do,

343
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,400
there ain't a thing worth havin'.

344
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,800
Rains so damn much,
it'll give you the chilblains.

345
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Dry spell come along,
you choke on the dust...

346
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,400
if a bushwhacker
don't take your last damn dollar.

347
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,600
- I mean it. Turn around and go back.
- Amen.

348
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,800
Listen, farming's always rough.
That ain't our line.

349
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,600
'Sides, you struck out too late in
your years. We're boys in our prime.

350
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:37,400
You know, seein' as you boys ain't
gonna hit a town for quite a while...

351
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,600
you must be getting kinda itchy,
you get me?

352
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,200
- What do you mean?
- Well, now...

353
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,200
You take Min here.
She's a gal and a half.

354
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:52,000
I mean, it's not exactly virgin
territory, if you know what I mean.

355
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,600
I'll make a bargain, seein' as
you're playin' it close to the vest.

356
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,200
$10 for all of you.
It's your last chance for poontang.

357
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,200
Make that $8 and you're on, honey.

358
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,200
Zeb?

359
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,000
Well, you boys drive a hard bargain,
but $8 it is.

360
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,200
Well, I ain't interested.

361
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,000
- What?!
- Oh, I just...

362
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,800
Well, nothin' to get riled about.
I just ain't interested.

363
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,600
You dumb shit.
You're turnin' this down?!

364
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,200
- Yeah, I am.
- God Almighty!

365
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,800
- He's saving it for his wedding day!
- Well, what if I am, damn it?

366
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,200
- Aw, honey, don't do that.
- Ma'am, I ain't discussing it.

367
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,000
Leave off him,
you goddamn sons of bitches.

368
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,600
Why you want to waste our money?
We got little enough as it is!

369
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
- In your case, that's the truth.
- Go to hell!

370
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,400
C'mon, Drew. Let them kill
themselves for all we care.

371
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,600
- Loney, Jim Bob?
- Just show us where to line up.

372
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,800
How do we know
we ain't buying no pig in a poke?

373
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,800
Min...

374
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,600
Lord.

375
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,800
Oh, Jesus.

376
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,200
- Simms, you in?
- Yeah, sure.

377
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,400
But... Well, you ain't got
no disease, have you?

378
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,400
- That's a hell of a thing to say.
- I just...

379
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,000
They say your brain rots away.

380
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,400
You tryin' to spoil it for us?

381
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,400
Where to, honey?

382
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,200
- That grass looks real soft.
- Well, you name it. I'm first.

383
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,200
Watch your step, now.

384
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,200
Drew,
you're a disappointment to me, boy.

385
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,000
Come on, you sweet thing.
I told you we'd live off the land!

386
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,800
I get seconds.

387
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,600
I get seconds.

388
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,400
It looks like
you're getting hind tit, Simms.

389
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,600
That's all right.

390
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,200
Well, you sure you're clean,
ain't you?

391
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,800
I know I am, hon,
but I can't vouch for your friends.

392
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,800
That was a dinger!

393
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,600
- You done already?
- I don't waste time.

394
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,800
After that, I expect
she's too tuckered out for you boys.

395
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,600
October 20th 1863.

396
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,000
I have resisted temptation,
but how hard it was.

397
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,400
How I long to be in the bosom
of my beloved family.

398
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,600
I think that I should find somebody

399
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,800
to toil with me
through life's weary way.

400
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,200
Unless I do, I will settle
for some poor means

401
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,800
of bestowing my affections
on some poor, pitiful creature,

402
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,800
the same as my good companions
did this afternoon.

403
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,000
What you getting up for?
It's another hour till your turn.

404
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,800
I can't sleep.
I was dreaming about ol' Min.

405
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,200
Hmm? About who?

406
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,600
About the gal this afternoon.

407
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,000
Oh.

408
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,000
She won't forget
that reaming I gave her.

409
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,200
Yeah, I suppose so.

410
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,600
Say, I figure we need an early start
to make up for lost time.

411
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:05,000
Yeah, I still can't figure out
why you took a passer on that.

412
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,800
Jake, you got something to say?

413
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,400
Damn it, you're looking sideways
at us since ol' Min.

414
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,400
What? No, I wasn't.

415
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,200
See, I ain't got anything
against your doing that,

416
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,600
but I was brought up different.

417
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,800
- Well, don't you wanna do it?
- Well, yes. It's just that...

418
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,400
Well, I was raised to honour a woman.

419
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,400
- You understand that?
- No.

420
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,400
Well, where I come from,
there's good women.

421
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,600
They do it just the same
as the other kind.

422
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,000
Oh, you just don't get it.
All right, lookit.

423
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,400
I've promised to stay on the good
side of life. OK, Jake?

424
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,400
All right? That's the end of it.

425
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,400
You really do come
from good stock, don't you?

426
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,400
Here.

427
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,600
This is them.

428
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
Yeah, that's real nice.

429
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,000
Makes me wish I'd took a picture
for reminders.

430
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,400
Yeah...

431
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,000
I do miss my mom sometimes.

432
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,600
I think about her every once
in a while, how she's doing.

433
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,800
Hey, don't tell them
that I been jabbering on like this.

434
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,600
So... you plan on getting married
before you give it a try?

435
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,000
- Huh?
- Something like that.

436
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,800
To each his own,
if you've heard of that.

437
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,200
Yeah, I've heard of it.

438
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,000
Well, seeing as how you're up...

439
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,800
Yeah, I'll take over for you.
Go get some shut-eye.

440
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,200
Here. Take it.

441
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
- So you don't wake us up too soon.
- Right.

442
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,200
Well!
That's a charming picture, ain't it?

443
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,400
Are we gonna stand here
or are we gonna rob 'em?

444
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
On your feet!

445
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,200
- Get up!
- Oh, my Lord!

446
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,800
Come on, get up.

447
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,200
Very nice. That's what
I call a perfect waking-up job.

448
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,600
Nobody fainted. Nobody screamed.
I didn't think you could do it.

449
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,600
- We ain't got anything.
- Sure you ain't.

450
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,600
Good, Hobbs. Very threatening.

451
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,800
Now, we've all had our fun,
let's set to work.

452
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,800
Hold it.

453
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,200
That's mighty brave, Hobbs,
considering the gun's pointed at me.

454
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,200
- I'll shoot if I have to.
- Shut up, boy.

455
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,600
You're lucky you're still alive.

456
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:53,000
Now, which one of you was covering
this unruly mob of angered youth.

457
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,400
God damn, Jackson.

458
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,800
I wouldn't mind you being stupid
if you was good company.

459
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,000
C'mon, Jake.
Shoot the son of a bitch.

460
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,200
Now, boy, let me give you
a little piece of advice.

461
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,200
If you're gonna pull a gun
on somebody...

462
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,600
which happens from time to time
in these parts...

463
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:23,000
you better fire it, because most men
ain't as patient as I am.

464
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,200
Ain't lost my touch yet.

465
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,200
Well, what are you waiting for?
Clean 'em out!

466
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,600
Here it is, almost lunchtime,
I ain't got change for breakfast yet.

467
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:51,600
You thought it was pretty funny what
that bastard said to me, didn't you?

468
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,200
This here's all I could find.

469
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,400
Two dollars and fourteen cents.

470
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,400
I'd like to find the son of a bitch
that told me to go west.

471
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:17,400
Hey, there's beans and molasses
and jerky and a little bit o' coffee.

472
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:22,600
Well! You boys must've brought along
a cook from Paris, France.

473
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,200
Take it all. Come on, Jackson.

474
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Goodbye, boys.

475
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,600
Just think of us as some terrible
nightmare that came and went.

476
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,200
By nightfall,
you'll forget we was ever here.

477
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,600
Who was on guard?

478
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,200
Jake?

479
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,800
You idiot!

480
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,600
- They got everything.
- They cleaned us out, Jake.

481
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,200
- God darn it! I'm talking to you!
- No, they didn't.

482
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,800
Pigs... and a cow!

483
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,400
- That means milk, fellas.
- What will you use for money?

484
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,200
We're starving, Jake. Nobody's
gonna turn starving boys away.

485
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,400
'Sides, there's always work
to be done on a farm.

486
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,200
I ain't doing no chores!

487
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,600
Well, maybe we can sweet-talk him.

488
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,800
If I tip my hat forward,
we go for our guns.

489
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
- If I tip it back, play it straight.
- Er, Jake...

490
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,200
Howdy.

491
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,400
- Yeah?
- Me and my friends hit bad luck.

492
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,000
- I figured you'd have some food.
- I might.

493
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,800
- Must be plenty to eat around here.
- There is...

494
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,600
for a price.

495
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,200
I say, look, now, er... sir?

496
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,600
We're... We're sorta short of money,
so could we make a trade?

497
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,000
- That's mine!
- Shut up, Boog.

498
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,600
You never had the ass
to swing it, anyway.

499
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,600
Here.

500
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,200
Some sow belly,
turnip greens and coffee.

501
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,200
For that gun?
We oughta get a turkey dinner!

502
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,600
I don't recollect
invitin' you here, boy.

503
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,400
It's all right. We'll make the trade.

504
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,600
Something wrong?

505
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,800
No, sir! It's the best damn
sow belly I ever had!

506
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,800
The food's all right, Jake.
Just eat it.

507
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,800
Kinda hard to eat
with a shotgun pointed at me.

508
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,600
- You do complain, don't you, boy?
- Think I'm scared of you?

509
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,400
For a dead-broke, you talk awful big.

510
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,600
- I shoulda plugged you.
- You're so full o' shit,

511
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,800
you're stinkin' up my yard!

512
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,000
- Take it easy.
- All right. You get.

513
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,600
All of you! Get!

514
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,800
- While you can get!
- Let's go.

515
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,400
- Come on, Jake!
- I ain't done yet.

516
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,000
I paid for it
and I'm gonna finish it.

517
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,800
Damn turnip greens is sour, anyway.

518
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,200
It wasn't our fault.

519
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:42,000
If he'd had any brains, he'd have
given us time to think about it.

520
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:49,000
Well, how can we rob a place when
you don't tell us till we get there?

521
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,000
Damn it!

522
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,400
That's as far as I go.

523
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,800
You yellow babies
sure backed me up! To hell with you!

524
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
- What are you doin'?
- I'm leaving. What's it look like?

525
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,200
Shoulda had more sense
in the first place.

526
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,800
Aw, just hold on.

527
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Look, now...
I ain't gonna say Jake's right.

528
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:21,000
He ain't. The business back there
with the farmer was pretty bad.

529
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,000
But everybody in this world
makes a mistake or two.

530
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,800
We all of us learned us a lesson.

531
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,400
Yeah? Well, what's he acting
so damn high an' mighty about?

532
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:37,400
Listen, ain't none of us woulda
got outta Saint Joe without Jake.

533
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:42,000
He got us this far,
he'll get us the rest of the way.

534
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,800
Lads,
I appreciate you asking me to stay.

535
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,600
And what you said
about that farmer was right.

536
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,600
It was dumb to spring it on you
sudden like that.

537
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,000
This time, I'm gonna work out
the plan with you now.

538
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,600
We got plenty o' time to prepare.
A stagecoach is heading this way.

539
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:06,200
- Easy. It'll be a professional job.
- Are you crazy?

540
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,400
- Bushwhack 'em, huh?
- Good thinkin'. He's getting smart.

541
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,200
Now, one of us
is gonna flag her down, y'see?

542
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,600
Like a traveller lost
on the prairie. That's you, Simms.

543
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,600
- Why me?
- You wanted to know ahead of time.

544
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,600
Well, now you know.
We'll hide in this gully.

545
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,000
No, sir! We know as much
about robbing stagecoaches

546
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,200
- as we do about skinning rabbits.
- There ain't nothin' to it, Drew.

547
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,800
No, sir! Now, I ain't takin' part
in no robbing of stagecoaches.

548
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,800
And I ain't askin' you
to side with me.

549
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And I don't want no share
of the loot.

550
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:48,200
That's fair, ain't it? I'm sitting
here till this foolishness is done.

551
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,000
This way, I won't see nothin'
and I can't bear witness.

552
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,800
- Lookee here...
- I ain't part of it!

553
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
- What about that hardware store?
- That's different. We could all die.

554
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,000
Jake?

555
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,000
Get out there!

556
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Put your gun away!

557
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,600
Get ready. Here it comes.

558
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
He's waving her down.

559
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,200
What do you want?

560
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,400
- He's talkin' to the driver.
- What's he sayin'?

561
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,600
All right, now. Get ready.

562
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,200
- What the hell is he doin'?!
- He's opening the door.

563
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,200
He's gettin' in.

564
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,200
He closed the door.

565
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,200
He's goin' away!
Simms! Come back here!

566
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:33,600
Hush up.
No need to announce ourselves.

567
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,600
Let's do something right for once.

568
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,000
Pie!

569
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,000
That dumb little pissant! Come on!

570
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,800
Come on!

571
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,000
Boog!

572
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,200
Wait!
Wait! I'm shot! My arm!

573
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,400
Come on! Come on!

574
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,400
I'm shot!

575
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,800
You sure picked a time
to catch a load.

576
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,800
- Ow!
- Hold still, damn it!

577
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,000
Boy, it's hell!

578
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,400
If it wasn't for you,
we'd go right back there...

579
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,600
We're gonna blow the bastard
to kingdom come. The son of a bitch.

580
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,200
Bastard.

581
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
- Loney, hand me a rag, will you?
- Get it yourself.

582
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,800
- What?
- We've had our fill, Jake.

583
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:35,000
- You ain't doing us no good at all.
- We can't see the sense of it...

584
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,800
and I'm sick of you
giving out orders.

585
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,400
I came west to get away
from that horseshit.

586
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:47,000
- What are you gonna do?
- We're going our own way.

587
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,800
- I'm sorry to hear it.
- Well, that's life.

588
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Why guns? I ain't stopping you.

589
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,200
Well... We're taking the horses.

590
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,800
We'll leave you the mule.

591
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,000
- You two try it for a while.
- You son of a bitch.

592
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,800
Leave us one.

593
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Come on. Don't be a bastard.

594
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,400
Don't worry, Jake.
We're better off without that trash.

595
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,600
You got the time, Drew?

596
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,800
What do you mean?

597
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,600
I think I'll take that gold pocket
watch you set so much store by

598
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,600
as a going away present.

599
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,400
Hey, that belonged to my brother.

600
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:55,400
Hell, you'll travel faster
on that ol' mule if you travel light.

601
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,200
- I'll kill you, Loney.
- Shut up, Drew.

602
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,000
- It's all I got to remember him by!
- You can join him if you'd rather.

603
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:09,400
All right. Give it back. I'm sorry
about what I said before. Please?

604
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
So long, Drew.

605
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,600
I hope your arm heals up.

606
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,800
You sons of bitches! You better run!

607
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I'll kill you if I get the chance!

608
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,200
Goddamn son of a bitch.

609
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,800
That is not fair! It is my watch!

610
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,200
Oh, who gives a damn
about the hunk of tin?

611
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,200
I do!

612
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:55,200
I'm sorry.
It was no cheap hunk of tin.

613
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,600
Kept good time.

614
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I said I was sorry!

615
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,600
- Oh, God damn it! Lord A'mighty!
- You wanna stop?

616
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,800
No, no. Keep goin'.

617
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,600
Nearly hell, though, I'll tell you.

618
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,400
You're lucky.
You ain't never been shot.

619
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:30,000
- You want me to stop?
- No, not me.

620
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,600
I ain't gonna hold us up.

621
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,000
God damn! Jesus!

622
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,200
Take that rein.

623
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,400
- What time do you make it?
- Er...

624
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,000
That son of a bitch!

625
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:00,200
Whoo! Well, pard, it's come to this.
Two saddle tramps wanderin',

626
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,200
- godforsaken...
...and in pain?

627
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,800
Look who's gonna be a silver baron!
Huh! Whoo!

628
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:15,400
It's only a way station for the
stagecoach, don't you see?

629
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:20,200
Wells Fargo. There's just an old man
to feed the horses and stuff.

630
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,200
I thought that chicken deal
would be OK...

631
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,600
This ain't the same kind of thing.

632
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:29,600
Hell, Jake, there ain't no stage
coming by this time of day.

633
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,800
- I bet he ain't even there.
- You think so?

634
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,600
Yep, I do.

635
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,400
Boy, I want one of them chickens.

636
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,800
Mmm, so do I.

637
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:50,200
All right. We go down quiet,
we take just one,

638
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,600
and then we hightail outta there.

639
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,800
Well, I can't, Jake. My arm.

640
00:59:55,600 --> 01:00:00,600
Well, I'm no good to you this way.
I mean, if I fell, I'd just scream.

641
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:05,400
- It's that bad, huh?
- Hell, one chicken's all we need.

642
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,600
I'm just talking sense, Jake.

643
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,600
All right. You wish me luck.

644
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,400
Smells wonderful.

645
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,800
Do you think she's done?

646
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,800
Yep.

647
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,200
Well, she's done enough for me.

648
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,400
Hey, where's mine?

649
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,800
- Yours?
- C'mon, you hog. I get half.

650
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,600
- Fair's fair, Drew. Heard o' that?
- What do you mean?

651
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,600
I took the risk. I stole the bird.

652
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:55,000
I coulda got killed.
Now I get to eat it.

653
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,000
Less'n you wanna buy a share.

654
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,800
- I got no money. You know that.
- Then, you lose.

655
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,000
I'd have been no good. My arm...

656
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,200
Bullshit! Bullshit your arm!

657
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,600
Well, eat your damn chicken, then!
I hope you choke on it!

658
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,600
Hey, pard...

659
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:27,400
I been thinking about going
to Virginia City. Give it a try.

660
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,800
- You have?
- Yep.

661
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:33,600
I figure I'd miss hearing you
spout off from time to time.

662
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,800
Listen, it beats goin' to the opera.

663
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:42,600
Besides, it would be a nice place
for a fella like me to settle down.

664
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,600
Not that I'd bust my ass digging
in a silver mine like you,

665
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
but I could rob the folks
digging it up.

666
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,400
That's just what I'd expect
from somebody

667
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:58,400
who won't even share a chicken
with a friend that's starving.

668
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,200
You are past saving, my boy,
I swear to God.

669
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Highest pockets in the USA.
Probably be governor one day.

670
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,200
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Yeah.

671
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,800
'Cause one day,
they'll get you ready to hang.

672
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,800
All the citizens will gather
to watch Jake Rumsey die,

673
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,600
then some lawyer'll say,
"Governor, sign this reprieve.

674
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:25,200
"Spare that poor fella's life!"
Boy, that'll be the best day ever!

675
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,400
- What, you wouldn't sign that?
- What do you think?

676
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:38,600
You would. Else I'd tell 'em how you
ran from defendin' your own country,

677
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,200
not to mention robbing
a hardware store.

678
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,800
- You would, too, wouldn't you?
- You're damn right!

679
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,400
I was gonna give you some
of this chicken here,

680
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:54,800
but why should I share a chicken
with a man who's gonna hang me?

681
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:06,200
God almighty. I ain't
never seen a dead body before.

682
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:10,600
I did. You aren't gonna vomit,
are you?

683
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,600
No.

684
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,800
Who do you suppose done it?

685
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Oh, the Lord punished 'em.
Why would anybody want to kill 'em?

686
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,000
- 'Sides us.
- You see their horses?

687
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:28,200
- Just to get their horses?
- Our horses is more like it.

688
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,200
Hey!

689
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,000
Where the hell are you going?

690
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:37,000
- Maybe they didn't get my watch.
- Why would they pass that up?

691
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,200
Hey!
Don't touch that dead man's skin.

692
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,400
Why not?

693
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:47,000
I don't know. You just ain't
supposed to, that's all.

694
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:55,600
Well... I guess we gotta bury
these sons o' bitches.

695
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,600
Hate to waste the time.

696
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,600
We got us some customers, Joe.

697
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,200
C'mon. Let's go get 'em.

698
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,000
Uh-huh.

699
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,400
Wait all day and nothin' happens.

700
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:30,000
Wouldn't you know, we just set down
to supper and somebody comes by?

701
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,600
You go on and eat your beans, Joe.

702
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:38,200
Me and the boys can take 'em easy.
There's only two.

703
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,800
M'boy, if it was a blind woman
in a wheelchair,

704
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,400
I'd still give her the odds.

705
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:48,200
C'mon... We can handle this.

706
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,800
Let's go!

707
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,000
I just know I'm gonna regret this.

708
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,000
Oh, shit.

709
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:26,800
- What are you two doing?
- Oh, just passin' through.

710
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,400
Looks to me
like you're standin' still.

711
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,600
We thought we seen
a jackrabbit, that's all.

712
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:44,400
I don't see no jackrabbit. You, Orin?

713
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,800
Nope. I see two jackasses, though.

714
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,200
Well...
Well, we'll be moving along now.

715
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,200
That's your horse, Jake.

716
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,600
No, it ain't. It looks like him,
but no, no...

717
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:02,400
- Well, adios.
- Adios?

718
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,600
What's your hurry, amigo?

719
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,000
Say, er... Mister?
I-I-I had this watch...

720
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,000
Th-this gold pocket watch,
it was, and, um...

721
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,200
- Drew...
- It belonged to my brother

722
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,400
and it ain't worth nothin'
'cept to me, but...

723
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,600
See, I promised my ma...

724
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,600
Drew,
these men ain't seen your watch!

725
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,400
Well, now we'll be movin' on.
So long.

726
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:31,800
Tick-tock... Tick-tock...
Tick-tock...

727
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:37,400
Sir, I advise you to hand that over.
My friend here is a lightning gunman.

728
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,200
Lightning gunman, is he?

729
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,200
Hobbs, you must be crappin'
all over yourself.

730
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:52,000
Well, I guess we ain't got no choice
but to try to defend ourselves.

731
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,400
We don't want no trouble.

732
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:02,000
We'll just light outta here,
all right?

733
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,200
You little sack o' shit!

734
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:51,200
They killed you, Orin!
Get one afore you die!

735
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:55,000
I'll blast the first one
I see right in the balls!

736
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:04,400
I'm dead! The little runt got me!

737
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,000
Drew! Drew! I'm outta bullets!

738
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,000
Jake?

739
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,200
Stop, you son of a bitch!

740
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:32,000
You murdering bastard!
Come back here!

741
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,000
Drew!

742
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,800
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

743
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,800
I'm coming, Jackson. Hold on!

744
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:56,800
Your friend has passed on! You're
welcome to keep coming, though!

745
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:02,400
You threatening me? I can stand
plenty, but I can't stand that!

746
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I'll kill you!

747
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,200
Well, we done it! That's the lot.

748
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:34,200
Go get your watch.

749
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,000
You sure as hell earned it.

750
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,800
Whoo! Ain't we a pair?

751
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I never let on, Jake,

752
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:53,400
but I been thinkin' I was a coward.

753
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,800
I mean, if I'd had to go to war,
I wasn't sure how I'd have been.

754
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,200
Well, I ain't worryin' no more.

755
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,400
I mean, sure, I was scared at first,

756
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:08,600
but when the chips were down,
it was clear sailing. I just...

757
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,000
You never robbed that store, did you?

758
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,400
By God, I got it!

759
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,800
Jake?

760
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,400
Jake!

761
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:37,600
Jake! Wh-where you hiding?

762
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,800
Hey, gimme back the money.

763
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,800
Why don't you ju? Jake!

764
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:51,800
I-I was gonna split the money
with you. Really and truly, I was!

765
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,800
There wasn't no place
to spend it here!

766
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,000
Jake!

767
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,000
Jake, you son of a bitch!

768
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:10,800
You come back here with my money
or I swear I'll kill ya!

769
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,200
November 27th 1863.

770
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:25,200
I try to look on the bright side,
but I can't think of what it can be.

771
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,600
I've been robbed of all my money

772
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,000
and left to die on the prairie,
alone and friendless.

773
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,800
Weather good.

774
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,400
November 28th 1863.

775
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,600
I have determined not to die
after all.

776
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:46,400
If the children of Israel could
endure 40 years in the desert,

777
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:50,200
then a Greenville, Ohio boy
ought to not give up.

778
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,600
I shot and ate a skunk today.

779
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,400
Taste didn't enter much into it.

780
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,600
November 29th 1863.

781
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,600
If I ever find Jake Rumsey,
I will kill him.

782
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,600
Marshal.

783
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:31,000
How long you been
with Joe Simmons' gang?

784
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:36,600
- About a month, sir.
- What jobs you pulled?

785
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:40,600
Couple o' stagecoaches
over by Oletha,

786
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,800
a few stray travellers
a little east of here,

787
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
caf down in Mansfield,
and then this.

788
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,200
- That all?
- Yes, sir.

789
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:54,400
- How many Joe got in his gang now?
- Er, ten.

790
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,400
No, nine... not counting me.

791
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,800
Where you hid out?

792
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,600
Son, in a couple of minutes,

793
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,600
you're gonna be face-to-face
with your maker.

794
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,000
Now, after what you did
to these people,

795
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:21,800
it'd go down easier with the Lord
if you help us as much as you can.

796
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:29,000
Follow that trail out front
west about 20 miles

797
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,600
till you come
to a cut-off heading north.

798
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:36,200
Take that till you come
to an ol' rundown shack. That's them.

799
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,800
Hoist him up, boys.

800
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,800
'Scuse me.

801
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,400
This Simmons, did a young fella join
up with him in the last day or so?

802
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,600
About my age?
His name is Jake Rumsey.

803
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,200
Well, er... thank you.

804
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:20,400
- We're all set, Marshal.
- Good luck, boy.

805
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,200
Marshal?

806
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,600
I'd like to join up with you, sir.

807
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:13,600
Now, as long
as I'm paying for these bullets,

808
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:16,800
I want to see a man drop
for every shot.

809
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,800
- About ready, Bobby?
- Just a minute.

810
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,000
All right!

811
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,600
Fire!

812
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,200
Take that, you no...

813
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,200
Chaw?

814
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:56,400
If I want to chew on horseshit,
I'll let you know.

815
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:01,400
Say, er... you was in Wichita
in '53, wasn't you?

816
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,400
Yep.

817
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:07,400
You must've known
Curly Bill Broshus, then?

818
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:14,000
Curly Bill? Always wore white gloves?

819
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:18,200
- That's the one.
- Bet you don't know why.

820
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,400
Cover up his warts.

821
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,200
- He was good with a gun, though.
- He was fair. Just fair.

822
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:34,000
Fair? Did you ever see him
do that, er... fancy spin of his?

823
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:38,600
Boy, where do you think
he learned that?

824
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,600
I taught it to him
when I was feeling generous.

825
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,400
Must've been Christmas.

826
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,200
Bull.

827
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,200
Smart.

828
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,000
Smart.

829
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:11,400
You got some real thinkers
in your outfit, Bobby.

830
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:37,400
I tell you, boys...
I'm the oldest whore on the block.

831
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:45,600
You sure come up in the world,
ain't you, pard?

832
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,600
Well, you laugh all you want,
young man,

833
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:58,800
but just remember, they're gonna
hang you, and I'm gonna watch it.

834
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,400
You think they'll really hang
a young fella like me?

835
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:06,200
- I know it for a fact.
- Aw, shit. You're probably right.

836
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:12,000
Remember when you left me
on the prairie to die?

837
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,200
Remember that?

838
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,200
Well, when I was wanderin' alone
and forsaken,

839
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,600
just about the time
I was ready to give up the ghost,

840
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:27,800
I said to myself, "Hang on.
If there's any justice in this world,

841
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,400
"you'll live long enough
to see Jake Rumsey dead."

842
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:38,800
Listen, pard, let's clear the air.
I mean, I ain't mad at you no more.

843
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,800
- What?!
- I consider we're even.

844
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,000
We're even?!
You stole my goddamn money!

845
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,000
- You hid it from us.
- Aw, sh...!

846
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:53,200
You lied,
you let me take all the chances,

847
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,800
let your pals near starve to death.

848
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,400
You bullshitted us to get in with us.
You bullshitted us right to the end.

849
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,400
You dirty bandit!
You know what you...

850
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:07,400
You're a two-faced shit-kicker,
and I'm glad to finally know it!

851
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:13,400
But like I said, we're square.
I figure I paid you back for lyin'.

852
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,000
- Know what I done with your money?
- What?

853
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:23,600
I spent it on whores. Just 'cause
I knew you wouldn't have done.

854
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,800
Now let's talk turkey.

855
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,400
I wouldn't talk nothin' with you.

856
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,400
Hey!

857
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,800
I bet you'd talk a thousand dollars.

858
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:45,400
- You ain't got a nickel.
- Not on me,

859
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,600
but I know where a thousand's buried.

860
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:53,600
Come on. You can get your $85 back
and then some.

861
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:58,400
- I got no reason to believe you.
- Now, you got that backwards.

862
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:02,000
You're the liar, I'm the crook.
I never lied to you.

863
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:05,200
You never did nothing for me, Jake!

864
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,600
You got the time?

865
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:19,200
See, you still got that watch that
meant so much. I didn't take that.

866
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,000
- Marshal, you need to listen...
- Look, son.

867
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:34,800
I got a bunch of people to hang
in the morning. Night's half gone.

868
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,800
Why don't you tell your friend
that you tried and I said no?

869
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,400
- Now, goodnight.
- Marshal, I know you're a fair man.

870
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:48,800
And Jake... He ain't one of them.
I-I... He really ain't.

871
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:53,000
It looks bad, I grant you that.
But I know Jake real well.

872
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:56,200
We started out west together.

873
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,200
Well, hell, sir,
he's white all the way through.

874
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,400
That's a real nice speech, son.

875
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:06,200
Why don't you tell that poor woman
whose husband we buried?

876
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:10,000
Jake didn't do that!
He don't want no part of killing.

877
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,800
Why, his only brother
was shot dead at Chickamauga.

878
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:16,400
Every dollar he gets,
he sends half back to his mother.

879
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:21,600
I know he don't look like much, sir,
but he's true blue. I swear it.

880
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,800
Now, boy, I don't usually take on
strangers in my outfit.

881
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,600
But you seem a Christian sort,
so I did.

882
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,200
Don't make me regret my decision.

883
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,400
Marshal, you don't want it
on your conscience

884
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,000
that you hanged an innocent man.

885
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,800
Get outta here, boy.
I wanna go to bed.

886
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
- Shh! It's me.
- It's about damn time.

887
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:04,400
- Come on.
- Hold still.

888
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,400
Come on!

889
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,400
- Where are the horses?
- Over this way.

890
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,600
Keep quiet.

891
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:29,600
Slow down! We got two days
on that posse. They won't catch us now.

892
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:14,400
Trying the drummer's farewell,
huh, Jake?

893
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:23,800
- Look, we gotta have a talk.
- There's no need for that.

894
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:33,400
You don't know
where no money's hid, do you, Jake?

895
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,000
Nope.

896
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,600
And you called me a liar.

897
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:43,200
Better shoot me and get it over with.

898
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:49,800
No.

899
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:54,000
No, I ain't gonna shoot you, Jake.

900
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:59,000
I ain't lettin' you outta my sight
till I get back my $85.

901
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:04,400
I'm stickin' to you like glue,
till you pay me back every cent.

902
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,800
