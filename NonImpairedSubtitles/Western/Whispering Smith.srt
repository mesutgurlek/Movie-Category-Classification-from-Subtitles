1
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,440
Come on. Let's get.

2
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,120
Hi, Murray.
Hello, Sam.

3
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,120
Well, hiya, Bill.

4
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,040
Hiya, Murray. Hiya, Captain.
How 'bout a splash of hot java?

5
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,000
Coming up. Hiya, Doc.
How are you, Baggs?

6
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,360
Why, you old ticket puncher, I thought
you'd pulled the pin on us and left.

7
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,760
Sure have, Murray. Got myself as
pretty a piece of land as you ever saw.

8
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,200
Say, who's the new brakie?
Him? Oh, that's Willie Figg.

9
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,600
Willie, meet Mr. Murray Sinclair, our
wrecking boss. Glad to know ya, Willie.

10
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,760
And don't forget, Willie. When you pile 'em up,
there's a poor goat that's gotta clean up the mess

11
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,720
What are you doing out this way,
Murray? There was a wreck, wasn't there?

12
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,600
Nah. Just a rock slide and a broken
arm. Lost a couple of empties.

13
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,240
- Hardly worth the trip, was it, Doc?
- No. Hardly. Hardly.

14
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,080
- You sound disappointed, Murray.
- Yeah. The bigger they are, the better I like 'em

15
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,920
It ain't like the old days, Bill.
The roadbed's as flat as a pool table.

16
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,120
All this new equipment, inspections
every time you turn around...

17
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,520
In a few years, we'll be railroading in
a dress suit, the way things are goin;

18
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,080
Get this: "Warning, all
personnel, Rocky Mountain division.

19
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,440
"Barton Brothers held up Cheyenne
Express last week. Guard murdered.

20
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,080
Barton's heading your vicinity. "
Why, the dirty, murdering snakes.

21
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,440
Yeah, but look what else it says:
"Luke Smith detailed to case.

22
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,880
'Give him every cooperation.
Luke Smith?

23
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,400
Signed, P.L. Bucks, President."

24
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,280
Let me see that.

25
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,160
Good old Smitty.
Now, there's a guy.

26
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,000
You know him?
You hear that?

27
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,280
He asked me do I know him. Why, we were
practically weaned off the same bottle.

28
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,440
Came west, started railroading together
right here on this division.

29
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,960
Yes. Smith rode shotgun for
us in the payroll car. Sure.

30
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,440
A couple of years, me and Smitty
roomed together at Emmy's. Remember?

31
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,480
Yeah. Yeah. That was before
Marian and I were married.

32
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,720
Now he's way up there...
Whispering Smith.

33
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,120
Trouble-shooter
for President Bucks himself.

34
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,440
Guys like Smitty
they don't make anymore.

35
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,760
What's he like? Well, he's
sort of quiet and gentle-like.

36
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,200
Till somebody spits in his
eye. Then he's like a rattler.

37
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,240
He just naturally unwraps himself.

38
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,800
Why, I've seen him toss six slugs into a gent's
belly button and never even seen him draw his guns

39
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,240
Yeah, but why do they
call him "Whispering Smith"?

40
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,240
Sonny boy, if you ever run off
with the company payroll...

41
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,320
and you hear somebody behind you talkin' low and
quiet, it's Whispering Smith and you're in trouble

42
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,240
What in the blazes? What does
he think he's doing up there?

43
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,520
Hey, you, Willie. Get forward and
tell that hogger to keep rollin'.

44
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,320
Maybe somebody's trying to flag us
down. Yeah. Maybe the Barton Boys.

45
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,400
Better get back.

46
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,120
Looking for someone?

47
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,080
Smitty! Smitty, we were
just talking about you.

48
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,360
How are ya, anyhow? Get away
from me, you big buffalo.

49
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,960
What have you been doing
with yourself? Hello, Baggy.

50
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,840
Hiya, Cap. Well, Doc, this
is just like coming home.

51
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,600
Come here, sweetheart. Let me look
at you. Boy, it's good to see you.

52
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,760
You too, Murray. Here. Let me
help you off with these wet things.

53
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,560
Get him a cup of coffee, Cap. You
sure picked a fine night for a walk.

54
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,760
Sit him down. What's the matter with
you? Don't you like horses anymore?

55
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,720
Sure. I had one,
but they shot it out from under me.

56
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,360
The Bartons?
Yeah. The Bartons.

57
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,320
How do you know?
This wire.

58
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,280
They won't get very far in this weather. The
way I see it, they'll hole up in Williams Canyon.

59
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,360
Then maybe you'll be around
for a spell, huh? Maybe.

60
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,440
That's great. Boy, when I take you home, Marian's
gonna just naturally fall flat on her face.

61
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,520
How is Marian? Wait till you see
her, and wait till you see my ranch.

62
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,640
I've got a spread
that'll knock your eyes out.

63
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,800
- Where's the next open telegraph station?
- An operator at Coyote Creek, but we don't stop.

64
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,800
I guess we have to. I gotta wire
the sheriff at Medicine Bend.

65
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,840
Yes, sir.
Coyote Creek it is.

66
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,960
When's the next train?
Which way?

67
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,200
- Either way.
- There's one due about now, but she don't stop.

68
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,280
She'll stop.
Get out your lantern.

69
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:32,720
Well? Get out your lantern.

70
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,400
Get movin;

71
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,200
Looks like she's stoppin'.
Sure enough is.

72
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,160
You and Gabby unhook the engine.
I'll see nobody gets off.

73
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,920
Come on. Let's go.

74
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,120
All right, hogger.
Back her up.

75
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,120
I said back her up.

76
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,520
Gabby, stand by to unhook her.

77
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,760
What's the matter, Barton?
Did your horses play out on ya?

78
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,960
Drop that gun on the seat.

79
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,120
Come on.
Get over here.

80
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,480
You hold him.

81
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,440
Smitty.
Smitty, you all right?

82
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,840
Get Barton. The operator...
They've shot him.

83
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,600
Go get Doc. Don't just
stand there. Go get him.

84
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,360
Doc can't do anything.
The poor guy's dead.

85
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,960
Hey, Doc! Doc!
They got him!

86
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,560
What? Are ya a crazy fool?
Why didn't you call for help?

87
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,840
Always tryin' to fight the
whole world single-handed.

88
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,120
Marian.

89
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,800
Hello, Luke.

90
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,040
Hello, Marian.

91
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,720
The doctor said
to keep you warm.

92
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,040
This your place?
Yes. Murray brought you.

93
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,280
Oh.

94
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,320
It's good to have you here, Luke,
even if it did take a bullet to bring you.

95
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,840
How bad is it?

96
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,520
You're lucky. By rights,
you oughta be dead. Look.

97
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,720
Oh. Oh, I should've
had this in my side pocket.

98
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,600
Remember?

99
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,760
Yes, if it's the one
I gave you.

100
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,600
It's the same one, all right.

101
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,600
It was such a long time ago.

102
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,000
Five years is a long time.

103
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,200
Where's Murray?
Asleep.

104
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,320
Oh.

105
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,800
You'd better get some sleep too.
It's almost daylight.

106
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,560
The doctor said the only thing
to worry about was fever.

107
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,000
You're gonna be just fine.

108
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,080
Good night, Luke.

109
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,720
Good night, Marian.

110
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,360
Marian?
Yes?

111
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,760
Nothing.

112
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,760
I just want to say thanks
for... everything.

113
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,480
Hi, Marian,
how 'bout that hot water?

114
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,840
Coming.

115
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,520
All right. All right.
So one of these days,

116
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,480
you'll stop a couple of bullets
with your teeth, and you'll end up...

117
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,360
I know. I know. I'll end up probate, with
coyotes chewing the buttons off my pants.

118
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,920
Luke, such talk!
It's not me. It's Murray.

119
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,520
That's all he's been saying
the last two days.

120
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,920
I wish you'd
think up some other words.

121
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,920
Now, on the level, Smitty. When
are you gonna give up riding herd...

122
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
on express car bandits and
get somethin' for yourself?

123
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,440
Such as what? Well, for one thing, you
could quit the railroad and throw in with me.

124
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:37,040
Huh? Sure. I've got more ranch
than one man could ever handle.

125
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,600
You put in with me, you can write your
own ticket. We'll run the Circle "Z" 50-50.

126
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,480
What do you say? Well?

127
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,600
Nice offer, Murray.
It just isn't in the cards.

128
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,720
- Why not?
- Well, l... For the first thing, I've got my job.

129
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,080
Job. You call that thing you've
got a job? A railroad cop?

130
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,000
I like the railroad, Murray. It's
in my blood just like it's in yours.

131
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,920
- You talk to him, will you, Marian? Tell him he's
crazy. - I think Luke should decide for himself.

132
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,480
Well, how about it, Smitty?
- Sorry, but thanks just the same.

133
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,040
Well, I'm not begging'.

134
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,480
- You must be out of your mind, though.
- Look out, Murray. You'll cut his throat.

135
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,840
Well, maybe I should.
Let some sense into him.

136
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,280
There.
Now you can pretty him up.

137
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,720
Thanks for the shave.
But next time, use a pair of pliers.

138
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,680
They'll pull out easier. Say, what are
you whacking into this skirt for, honey?

139
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,760
I'm shortening it. Ho, ho,
ho. You see that, Smitty?

140
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,680
You haven't been here five minutes, and
already, she's wanting to show off her legs.

141
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,680
Murray, please!

142
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,280
- All set, Murray?
- Yeah. I'll be right with you.

143
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,320
Where you goin'? Into town. I'm three
days late with my report on that wreck.

144
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,560
Old shiny pants'll be bawling'
like a stuck calf. "Shiny pants"?

145
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,840
Yeah. The new division superintendent,
George McCloud. You know him? No.

146
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,960
He's a college guy. Got a little book
called How to Run a Railroad. Bye.

147
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,800
Take good care of him,
Marian.

148
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,440
What's the trouble, boys? It's that sheepherder,
Rostro. He's back up in the North Flats again.

149
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,440
Yes, and them stinking', woolly maggots has grazed
off better than a half section of good cow feed.

150
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,760
- What did you do about it?
- Nothing'. We...

151
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,560
Nothing'? Why, you dumb beef heads,
what do you think I'm paying you for?

152
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,960
Go on. Get back up there. Take the dogs and
run those blasted sheep clear into the river.

153
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,480
But, Murray, the North Flats don't
belong to us. That's government range.

154
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,440
- Rostro has as much right to graze there...
- You keep out of this, will ya?

155
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,480
The trouble with Marian, she been mixing in things
that are none of her business and I'm stopping her

156
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,760
Go on! Get goin'!

157
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,600
Don't feel badly, Marian.
He didn't mean it.

158
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,440
You know, sheep'll
make any good cattleman edgy.

159
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,720
Thank you, Joe. Cigars in
the back. Thanks, Murray.

160
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,040
Hi, Murray.

161
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,040
Hello, Bob.

162
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,920
Hello, Murray.
Hey, George.

163
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,600
Hi there. Hiya, Chief.
What's been keeping ya?

164
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,400
Hello, Murray. How's Smitty?
Doing fine. Just his arm was nicked.

165
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,400
- The doc said it was mostly exhaustion.
- Oh, that's great.

166
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,920
- Why don't you drive back with me and see for
yourself? - That's a deal.

167
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,480
- Is all that equipment back from Frenchman's
Flats? - Just checking in now.

168
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,600
Good. Hey, out in the buckboard,
fellas, there's a whole mess of cigars.

169
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,120
The crate's a bit mashed,
but the smokes are fine. Help yourself.

170
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,040
Thanks a lot, Chief.
Thanks, Murray. Thanks.

171
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,280
Don't thank me. Thank the
insurance company. Hey,

172
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,840
you'd better get your report in
to McCloud.

173
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,600
- He's been yelling his head off.
- Let him yell.

174
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,560
- Good morning. - Well, come on in, McCloud.
Save me a trip to your office.

175
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,880
I suppose you want that report.
Yes.

176
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,240
As a matter of fact, I was rather
expecting it day before yesterday.

177
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,120
Oh, you did? Well, I've
had a sick man on my hands.

178
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,240
Smith. Yes, I know.

179
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,800
Here it is. And it's all there,
unless you'd like it in violet ink.

180
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,280
No, Sinclair. All I'm
interested in is its accuracy.

181
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,520
And hereafter, I shall expect these
reports immediately you come off a wreck.

182
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,200
Get your hat and coat
and let's go.

183
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,960
Rebstock, huh?
Yeah.

184
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,200
Four-X. That's his brand.

185
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,680
Hello, Barney! Hi, Whitey!

186
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,120
Well, hello, Murray.
If this ain't something, huh?

187
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,440
And old Bill Dansing.
How're ya, Bill?

188
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,720
Hello, Rebstock.
You remember Whitey Du Sang.

189
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,680
Yeah. I know him.

190
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,640
- You going to town?
- Oh, just shipping another bunch of cattle.

191
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,640
Say, what's this I hear about Whispering
Smith? Got himself shot up or something, huh?

192
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,840
Yeah.
Pretty bad, huh?

193
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,920
No, no, no, no.
Nothing at all.

194
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,800
Oh, uh.
Well, I'll be seeing ya.

195
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,720
Say, why don't you take a ride out to
Williams Canyon some night for a hand of poker?

196
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,520
Been a long time since me and the
boys seen any of that railroad money.

197
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,880
Yeah, I'll do that, Barney.
Well, so long. So long, Whitey.

198
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,760
Giddyap.
Fine.

199
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,720
What's the matter with you, Bill?
I don't like your friends, Murray...

200
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,080
Rebstock, Du Sang.

201
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,040
I know that Whitey. He's as
cruel as a soft-nosed bullet.

202
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,720
He'd shoot a dying man
just to see him squirm.

203
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,360
He's a beauty.
Did Murray raise him?

204
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,080
No. He's a present from
Barney Rebstock. Rebstock?

205
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,280
You remember him.
Yeah. I remember him.

206
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,560
Quite a spread Murray has
here. He's very proud of it.

207
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,280
I'll bet he is.

208
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,800
Luke?
Yes?

209
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,320
It's just a woman's curiosity,
but why haven't you ever married?

210
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Well, I never thought
I had enough to offer,

211
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,000
at least to one girl
I had in mind.

212
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,880
Then you did
have someone in mind?

213
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,440
Yes. l... I had someone
in mind, all right.

214
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,240
Was she attractive?

215
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,880
I thought so.

216
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,000
Then you never got around to
asking her... to marry you, I mean.

217
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,560
No, I never did.

218
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,560
Do you think
that was fair to the girl?

219
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,280
Maybe she was just waiting
for you to ask her.

220
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,120
Why didn't you let her decide,
Luke?

221
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,920
Why didn't you?

222
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,680
Well, don't blame the girl
too much, Luke.

223
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,400
You can't blame her.

224
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,760
The years pass so quickly.
I know.

225
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,880
Well, there's nothing
can be done about it now.

226
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,040
No.

227
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,080
Hiya, Hank. Hello, Smitty!

228
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,240
Am I glad to see you.
Hello, Bill. How are you?

229
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,640
Got yourself another touch
of lead poisoning, huh?

230
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,160
Sure look good on you,
though. You certainly do.

231
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,120
How's Emmy?
Oh, Emmy's just fine.

232
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,120
Said for me to tell you your old
room's all ready and waiting'.

233
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,960
Ah. Having you two kids together
again, I could spit nickels.

234
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,600
Go ahead, Bill. Here, Smitty.
Here's a present for you.

235
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:39,360
And always carry it in your shirt
pocket. Oh, well, thanks, Murray.

236
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,320
Well, look at this.

237
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,560
Ready, boys?
Let's go.

238
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,840
Acquaintance be forgot

239
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,320
And never brought to mind

240
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,120
Should auld acquaintance
be forgot

241
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,280
In the days
of auld lang syne

242
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,120
Met a friend of yours coming
out, Smitty. Barney Rebstock.

243
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,560
Uh, Barney heard you'd been
shot up. He asked after you.

244
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,400
Yeah. He seemed mighty disappointed
when he heard you wasn't buried yet.

245
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,600
Was he headed for town?
Shipping a bunch of steers.

246
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,680
I'll drive back to town
with ya, Bill. What for?

247
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,960
A word with Rebstock.

248
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,480
Why don't you keep your big
mouth shut? Yeah, why don't I?

249
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:33,280
Now, wait a minute, Smitty. What's the
rush to see Rebstock? I want Barton.

250
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,240
What? Are you crazy? You think he's got
Barton in his hat or somethin'? Yeah.

251
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,840
Why? I got a hunch he's got
Barton holed up in Williams Canyon.

252
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,160
Come on, Bill. Now, look, Smitty.
Let me handle this, will ya?

253
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,840
If your hunch is right, maybe I can
persuade Rebstock to turn Barton in.

254
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,560
What are you mixing in this for?
Well, you're certainly in no shape to.

255
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,960
Any other reason?

256
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,720
I don't want any trouble
with Rebstock.

257
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,960
Since when has a man like Rebstock, a thief
and a cattle rustler, meant anything to you?

258
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:07,200
If a man's railroading or in the cattle business,
he's gotta be friendly with his neighbours.

259
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,320
All right, Murray. Take it
easy. This is my job, remember?

260
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,480
This is what Bucks
pays me for.

261
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,160
- Good-bye, Murray. Tell Marian thanks
for everything. - Yeah. I sure will.

262
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,720
Well, hello, Smith.
Hello there.

263
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,160
Hopping around again, huh? Well, I'm
certainly happy it's nothing serious.

264
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,240
- I'd like a word with you, Rebstock. - It'd be a
real pleasure, son, but I'm a little busy now.

265
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,440
I wanna get the cattle loaded before...
All right. When?

266
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,720
Well, how 'bout Pete's
right after supper?

267
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,280
I'd esteem it a privilege to
buy you a drink. I'll be there.

268
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,800
Fine. Come on.

269
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,280
I don't like it, Smitty.
I don't like any part of it.

270
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,240
That Whitey. Did you see his eyes?
They were cutting your liver out.

271
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,560
I'm telling ya, Smitty, you're walking
right into it. You, with only one arm.

272
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,200
Aw, take it easy, Bill. Sweet suffering
Moses, boy, why don't you get the sheriff?

273
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,800
Mac? By the time he got on a
horse, Barton'd die of old age.

274
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,880
Oh, Mr. McCloud!

275
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,440
Mr. McCloud, I'd like you to meet
Luke Smith. So you're the great Smith.

276
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,280
I don't know about that. Glad
to hear it was nothing serious.

277
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,560
Well, thanks.
Heard a lot about you, Smith.

278
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,880
All of it good, I hope.
Good?

279
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,560
Well, according to President
Bucks, you're practically a legend.

280
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,840
He just sent me a wire. He seemed pretty happy
about the way you handled the Barton business.

281
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,880
You can tell him the score on the
Bartons is still two down and one to go.

282
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,080
I certainly will.
Luke.!

283
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,960
- Luke!
- I'll be seeing you.

284
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,600
Well, well. How's my boy?
Hello, Emmy.

285
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,880
Ohh.

286
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,520
Oh, Luke, it seems
you're always in trouble.

287
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,120
One of these days, you're
gonna... Don't worry about me.

288
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,000
The important thing is how are
you? Oh, I'm fine, Luke, just fine.

289
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,960
And still got her looks, huh,
Smitty, even if she is falling apart.

290
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,960
Falling apart? You, with your store
teeth and your hair coming out.

291
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,000
Say, Emmy, if you've got a horse, I could eat
half of it. Supper'll be right on the table.

292
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,720
The sooner, the better, on account
of tonight, I gotta see a man...

293
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,680
about a dog.

294
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,640
Put him away, Seagrue.
Say, I was down the south meadow.

295
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,880
We'd better get those cattle out of there tomorrow
Take care of it first thing in the morning.

296
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,440
Hi there, honey!
Mm.

297
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,080
Oh, Murray,
won't you ever grow up?

298
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,520
If you'll call Luke now, we'll
eat. Luke's gone into town.

299
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,640
What for? He had some crazy
idea he could nail Barton.

300
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,200
Barton?
Mm-hmm.

301
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,240
Murray, he's in no condition to do that.
That's what I told him, but you know Smitty.

302
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,080
But Barton's dangerous.
He's a killer.

303
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,880
Oh, Murray, why did you let him go? Why?
Anybody'd think Smitty was still in knee britches.

304
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,000
Well, I wouldn't worry about him
if he was all right.

305
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,120
Murray, if anything should happen to
him, we'd never forgive ourselves, never.

306
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,120
All right, honey. If that's the way you
feel about it, I'll drive you into town.

307
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,680
And if you can talk him out of it,
I'll buy you a new hat.

308
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,160
Howdy, Mr. Rebstock. What'll it be? Oh,
I'll take a little of that special...

309
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,280
I thought I told you
to stay out of town.

310
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,480
So you did.
So I'm in town.

311
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,400
So what about it?

312
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,480
So you'll be picked up,
that's what.

313
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,000
Picked up?
I'm getting out of here.

314
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,000
Did you hear him, Whitey?
He's getting out of here.

315
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,720
Where'd you think
you'd be going, son?

316
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,880
There's lots of states
in the Union, ain't there?

317
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,120
Son, you can hit the trail from here
to China, and every mile of the way,

318
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,920
Whispering Smith'll be breathing
down the back of your neck.

319
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,080
Smith?
Yes.

320
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,840
The guy that as long as you
live'll be keeping you on the jump.

321
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:00,360
Hiding out in back rooms. Afraid to walk
up to a bar and take your liquor like a man.

322
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,200
Yeah. Smith.

323
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,480
Maybe Blake likes to run.

324
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,360
Who's running'?
You are.

325
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:16,000
And that's something I've gotta see. A growed-up
running from the guy that killed his two brothers.

326
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,800
Why, if you had the guts of a
grasshopper, son, you'd call Smith's hand.

327
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,400
You're better off dead than
sweating every time a door opens.

328
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,320
And it's gonna open
pretty soon now,

329
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,560
because Smith's on his way
over here.

330
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,640
Where ya goin', son?
Outside.

331
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,160
Me and Smith are gonna
need plenty of elbow room.

332
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,080
Say, Blake...
What?

333
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,760
If you need any help...

334
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,080
You wait out here.

335
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,560
Smitty, why don't you listen to
reason? You wanna help me, don't you?

336
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,640
You know I do. You stay out
here and keep your eyes open.

337
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,360
Well, well. So here you
are. Sit you down, son.

338
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,840
Sit down.

339
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,320
Well, you see, Whitey and
me's all ready for you.

340
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,600
There we are.

341
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,680
Now then, son,
just what's on your mind?

342
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,760
Any favour me and Whitey
can do for ya'll be a real pleasure.

343
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,320
- Won't it, Whitey?
- Rebstock, I'll not waste your time,

344
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,200
and I'll thank you
not to waste mine.

345
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,560
You've got Blake Barton.
I want him.

346
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,920
Well, that's just fine, son,
just fine and dandy.

347
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,080
And how would you like him wrapped up...
fancy-like, with pink ribbons, or just plain?

348
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,640
Don't be a clown, Rebstock.

349
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,600
- Ain't you got enough troubles?
- Yeah. You want part of 'em?

350
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,160
Keep your hands on that table, or I'll blast you
out of the chair. Now, boys, boys, boys. Listen.

351
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,840
Listen, son. You got me all wrong. If we had
Barton, it'd be a pleasure to turn him in.

352
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,640
I know enough polecats
without hiding out one of his stripe.

353
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,720
No, sir. You certainly
have got me all wrong.

354
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,840
I'll tell you what I'll do, Rebstock.

355
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,880
I'll give you 48 hours
to run Barton out of Williams Canyon.

356
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,040
If you don't,
I'm coming in after him.

357
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,040
And that might not
be too good for you.

358
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,520
Give me three cards.

359
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,240
Hello, Bill.
Hello, Doc.

360
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,560
Smitty, just saw him walking' down the
track... looked like Barton. Don't look.

361
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,280
Get under cover.
Smitty.

362
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,320
You heard me.
I said get under cover.

363
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,400
Good night, Doc.

364
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,120
Hey, come on! This way!

365
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,080
You got him.! Good boy.!
Nice goin', Mr. Smith.

366
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,960
I heard the shooting', and l... Yeah, we
know. So you stopped to shine up your badge.

367
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,160
Take over, Sheriff. I
certainly will, Mr. Smith.

368
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,320
And don't fall
down no gopher holes.

369
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,120
What's the matter, Du Sang?

370
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,680
Are you losing your touch?

371
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,080
Quit worrying', Marian.
Quit worrying'.

372
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,360
Did you see them?
That's Rebstock and Du Sang.

373
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,640
Aw, stop acting like
you were his nurse or somethin'.

374
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,760
Hi there.

375
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,480
Luke! Luke!

376
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,760
Luke. Why, Marian, what's the matter?

377
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,360
Oh, I was so afraid. I was so worried
that... There's nothing to worry about.

378
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,880
I'm all right.

379
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,440
See? I'm all in one piece.

380
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,080
Hiya, Smitty.
So long, Luke.

381
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,960
Oh, where have you been
Billy boy, Billy boy

382
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:29,320
Oh, where have you been
charming Billy

383
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,440
I have been to seek a wife

384
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,800
She's the darling of my life

385
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,080
She's a young thing

386
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,160
And cannot leave her mother

387
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,240
- Emmy, what's the time? - It's an hour
past breakfast, that's what time it is.

388
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,360
He could stay
in bed all day.

389
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,400
Can she bake a cherry pie
Billy boy, Billy boy

390
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,680
Can she bake a cherry pie
charming Billy

391
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,240
She can bake a cherry pie
quick as cat can wink its eye

392
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,320
She's a young thing

393
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,160
And cannot leave her mother

394
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,120
You shouldn't have bothered, Emmy. I've
gotta make the most of ya while I got ya.

395
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,080
Ohh, bless you.

396
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,440
Drink your coffee
before it gets cold.

397
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,800
Good morning, Doc.
Emmy.

398
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,040
Hello, Doc.
How are you, Smitty?

399
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,440
Hello, Baggs.
How's that flipper coming along?

400
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,160
Oh, good as new, thanks.
Fine. Fine.

401
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,200
You know, that's four slugs I've dug
out of him. Sort of saving them up.

402
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,880
Bobby, shake hands with Mr.
Smith. Bobby's my grandson.

403
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,600
He's been batching with me out at the
ranch a spell. Oh. Glad to meet you, Bobby.

404
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,760
Say, are you Whispering Smith?
That's what they tell me.

405
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,320
Aw, gee.
Is this your dog?

406
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,200
Yeah. That's Holy Moses.
Hmm. What's he got in his mouth?

407
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,560
Huh? Well.

408
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,320
You oughta take a lesson
from your dog, learn to save your money.

409
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,760
Smitty, we've gotta be
running along. All right, Doc.

410
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,720
So long, Luke.
Bye, Baggs.

411
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,640
Take it easy, boy.
Good-bye, Bobby.

412
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,240
Bye, Mr. Smith.

413
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,160
Come on, Bobby.
We'll try again later.

414
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,840
Hiya, boy.
Good morning, Bill.

415
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,520
You still thinking' about
leaving town today? I think so.

416
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,960
Oh, Bill?

417
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,080
Yeah?

418
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,520
Before I go, there's something I've
been meaning to ask you. What is it?

419
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,880
It isn't easy. It's...
Well, it's about Murray.

420
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,920
Since when's there ever been anything
about Murray that wasn't easy?

421
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,440
- Now, don't get sore.
- I ain't sore. I'm just asking'.

422
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,120
How do you explain his friends? Rebstock,
Du Sang... the Williams Canyon outfit?

423
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,480
Murray's a growed man,
ain't he?

424
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,440
- Or we still gotta pick his playmate?
- Look, Bill. This is your house.

425
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,520
You don't have to listen if
you don't wanna. I'm listening.

426
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,240
All right. How much do you
figure he makes railroadin'?

427
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,440
I don't know.
I never seen his paycheque.

428
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,840
120 a month,
maybe 200, but not any more.

429
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,120
- What are you getting at?
- His ranch.

430
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,480
How do you figure he can
build up a spread like that?

431
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,680
- Not on what the railroad's paying him.
- Smitty,

432
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,440
I ain't sore and I ain't mad,
but I'm telling ya, see...

433
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:29,280
Whatever Murray's doin' or ain't doin',
I don't think it's any of your business.

434
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,800
You're wrong, Bill.

435
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,480
He's the best friend I've got, the
greatest guy that ever pulled on a boot.

436
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,520
When I see him heading' for an
open switch, that's my business.

437
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,680
And it's yours too.

438
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,040
Yeah. Yeah,
I guess you're right.

439
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,200
Here. Quit loafing
and get to work.

440
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,320
Well, Smitty, if I don't see
ya... I'll see ya before I leave.

441
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,440
Good-bye, Emmy.
Bye.

442
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,800
Well, where do you think
you'll go from here?

443
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,640
Utah, Nevada, California.

444
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,800
- I'll let Bucks worry about that.
- Oh, Luke, why don't you stay?

445
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,640
You know why
I don't want to stay, Emmy.

446
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,120
Never wanted to come here
in the first place.

447
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,080
A wreck!

448
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,360
Baggs!

449
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,800
Anybody hurt?

450
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,920
Smith, I'm taking a run
out to the wreck.

451
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,200
I'd consider it a favour if you'd
come with me. I'd be glad to.

452
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,960
Slack off!

453
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,680
Give me that hook
over here, Bill.

454
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,800
Okay. Take it away!

455
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,000
It's all yours, boys.

456
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,040
Look out below.!

457
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,560
Check this one,
will ya, Bill?

458
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,320
How we doin', Seagrue? First rate.

459
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,720
Here, Seagrue.

460
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,000
Here you go, men.
Cigars on the house.

461
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,240
Seagrue.
Thanks.

462
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,320
Now, look. When you get a load, take it over
to Rebstock's place and come right back here.

463
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,240
Sure will.
Where do you want this barrel?

464
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,280
Let's set it up over here,
Frank.

465
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,360
Easy, Murray.
That case ain't even damaged.

466
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,960
Well, it is now.

467
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,960
Look, boys! Come and get it!

468
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,480
Hiya, Murray.

469
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,680
Hi, Smitty. Why, you old buzzard,
you. What are you doing out here?

470
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,520
I thought I'd come around and
kick the lead out of your pants.

471
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,240
Sinclair, is this brandy?
Yeah, sure. Have some.

472
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,200
It'll make a man out of you.

473
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,920
You realize, of course, that drinking
on the job is against the rules.

474
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,440
Sweating out here in the hot sun like this,
a man needs more in his guts than plain water.

475
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,760
Isn't that right, fellas?
That's right.

476
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,280
- These cigars. Are they off the wreck too?
- Where else?

477
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,320
Sinclair, I'll give you five minutes;
then I'll expect these men back at work.

478
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,880
Why, you...
Take it easy, Murray.

479
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,640
He's only trying to do his job.
He's got a lot to learn yet.

480
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,360
Maybe I should learn him
with a pick handle.

481
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,080
Why don't you try giving him a break?
Maybe he'll learn as he goes along, huh?

482
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,480
What's that you're loading?

483
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,880
Oh, just some stuff that... some stuff
that got busted up in the wreck, I guess.

484
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,280
You got a match?
Driver?

485
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,280
Yeah?
Whose wagon is this?

486
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,680
- Hey, Murray!
- Yeah!

487
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,280
Fella here wants to know
whose wagon this is.

488
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,120
It's mine, and these
men are off my ranch.

489
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,200
What is all this? It's
just exactly what you see...

490
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,640
damaged merchandise,
mostly junk.

491
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,600
Where are you hauling it?

492
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,080
What's it to you
where we're hauling it?

493
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,920
Junk, huh?
Personally, I'd call it loot.

494
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,720
McCloud, I don't like that word.

495
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,640
Hauling away about $2,000 worth
of perfectly sound merchandise,

496
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,120
I think loot's the right word.

497
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,760
As long as there's been a railroad, stuff
like this has been for the wrecking crews.

498
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,520
Am I right, boys?

499
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,000
That's one of the things
Bucks sent me here to stop.

500
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,200
Sinclair,
you'll unload that wagon.

501
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,600
Dansing, set this stuff
back on the right-of-way.

502
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,120
All right, boys... I'll brain the
first man that lays a hand on it!

503
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,680
That's right, Murray!

504
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,360
Murray, I think we can talk this
over quietly, the three of us.

505
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,320
Now, you stay out of this, Smith.
This is between me and McCloud.

506
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:56,640
No, Murray, it's between you and the
railroad. And I'm afraid that cuts me in.

507
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,960
All right, boys. Clear the tracks.
And lay off my crew, will ya?

508
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,560
If you want my job,
say so, and I'll quit.

509
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,880
No, Murray. I'm only asking
to talk this over. Come on.

510
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,480
Anything you got to say, you can
say right here, but say it fast.

511
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,120
That wreck's gonna sit across
the tracks until this thing's settled.

512
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,520
You mean, it's either your way, or
you'll tap the whole line, is that it?

513
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,840
That's it. Murray, I still
think we can talk it over.

514
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,480
Sure, we can,
but it'll never be your way.

515
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,400
Bill, you heard what
Mr. McCloud said.

516
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,440
Start unloading that wagon. All right,
Seagrue. Get movin'. Haul that load out of here.

517
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,920
Seagrue, if you move those mules,
I'll shoot them from between the traces.

518
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,440
All right, Bill.
Unload that wagon.

519
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,520
You want this stuff, huh?
By Judas, you'll have it!

520
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,440
Come on, boys! Lend a hand!

521
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,360
Here's a dress for ya!

522
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,240
- Sinclair, you're fired.
- That suits me fine, just fine!

523
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,120
And me too! And give 'em mine.
Sure, I'm sticking with Murray!

524
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,200
You boys were through
the moment you got on that wagon.

525
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,920
You know the trouble with you, Smith. You've worn
a marshal's badge so long, you now smell like one.

526
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,760
All right, Seagrue. Let's go. We'll
cool off at the ranch with a few drinks.

527
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:18,120
Hyah.! Here we come.! Giddyap,
there.! Come on.! Giddyap, there.!

528
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,640
Come on. Break it up!
All right, men. Get back to work!

529
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,440
Sinclair's
a pretty tough customer.

530
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,880
No, he's not tough.
Just hog-headed stubborn, that's all.

531
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,040
Get back to work.! Come on. Clear
off that track.! Right or wrong,

532
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,680
once Murray starts something,
he'll finish it, regardless.

533
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,640
Somehow,
we have to fix this up, McCloud.

534
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,920
He's too good a man to lose.

535
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,640
That McCloud,
sticking his big nose in.

536
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,840
I bet he just about busted his neck
getting his report into Bucks.

537
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,840
You know Murray.
Try shoving him around,

538
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,760
and he'll beat your brains out
just for the fun of it.

539
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,680
McCloud just doesn't
know how to handle him.

540
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,960
- It's past 8:00.
- Bill should be back.

541
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,400
Do you think he'll have talked
Murray into coming with him?

542
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,320
There's a chance.

543
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,720
Like I said the other day...

544
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,960
Marian!
Hello, Emmy.

545
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,520
Hello, dear. Hello, Luke. Hello, Marian.

546
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,600
I just got in with Murray and Bill.

547
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,600
They stopped off at Pete's
to have a drink.

548
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,600
Poor Murray.
I guess he really needed one.

549
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,520
He'll be right over.

550
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,640
Bill told us that you'd wired Bucks,
interceding for Murray.

551
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,680
I've been praying all the way into town
that'll it'll work out all right.

552
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,240
Now, don't worry, Marian.

553
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,760
Bucks has never turned me down yet,
and he won't now.

554
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,320
When do you expect
an answer from him?

555
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,720
Any minute.

556
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,000
He... He knows I'm leaving.

557
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,160
Leaving? When?

558
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,120
Tonight.

559
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,800
Come on, Bill.!

560
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,720
Emmy!

561
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,520
W-Well.
How's my sweetheart?

562
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,120
Phew! How many you boys had? We only...

563
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,040
Liar!

564
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:12,400
Hi there!
Hi, yourself.

565
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,400
I guess I sort of jumped the tracks
a little this morning, Smitty.

566
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,840
I'm sorry.
Forget it, Murray.

567
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,640
Smitty, you're all right.

568
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,760
Same ol' Smitty, huh, Marian?

569
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,840
Always turning the other cheek.
Not always, Murray.

570
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,040
Say, Bill tells me
you wired Bucks.

571
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,080
Yes, we should have
an answer by now.

572
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:36,000
See, honey? There's nothing
to worry about... not a thing.

573
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,960
Smitty wired Bucks, and what
Smitty says goes, huh, Smitty?

574
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,720
Hello, Bill.
Telegram for Mr. Smith.

575
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,880
Thanks, Mickey.
All right.

576
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,520
Thanks, Bill.

577
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,400
I'm...

578
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,600
sorry, Murray.

579
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,440
Looks like Bucks is getting himself
quite an education.

580
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,160
There are some pretty fancy words here.

581
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,080
"Appreciate your intervention,

582
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,520
"but am convinced that Sinclair
has outlived his usefulness.

583
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,560
This decision is final."

584
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,440
Well, you didn't do so well,
did you, Smitty?

585
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,000
I'm sure
Luke did all he could.

586
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,280
Yeah, I'll bet he did.

587
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,160
Murray.

588
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,280
Luke is leaving town tonight.

589
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,320
Oh?

590
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,240
Yeah?

591
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,440
I'm afraid Bucks
has made a mistake...

592
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,000
a big mistake.

593
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,160
Luke, that'll be your train.

594
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,400
I'd better be getting on it.

595
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,240
Come on, girls.
Let's go see him off.

596
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,720
Good-bye, Emmy.
Good-bye, Luke.

597
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,400
Sure felt like coming home.
God bless you.

598
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,680
Come back soon. Promise, now. Sure.

599
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:47,240
All aboard.!

600
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,520
Good-bye, Marian.
Take care of yourself.

601
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,440
I'm sorry
Murray acted the way he did.

602
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,520
You can't blame him.

603
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,760
He's disappointed,
and so am I.

604
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,080
Tell him I'll try again
when I get to Chicago.

605
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,560
Thanks, Luke.

606
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:07,600
Please write.
Sure. You do the same.

607
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,320
All aboard! So long, Bill.
So long. Take it easy, boy.

608
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,320
Oh, Bill!
Yeah?

609
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:21,320
Take care of Murray for me, will
you? I sure will, Smitty. I sure will.

610
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,160
If you've got the price, we've
sure got the thirst! Well, Murray.!

611
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,720
Come on down here.

612
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,080
Sit down, son.

613
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,680
Waiter, another glass here
for Mr. Sinclair.

614
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,120
Well, son, I hear you've been
having your troubles.

615
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,640
As I always say,
when a man's having his troubles,

616
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,000
that's when a man
needs his friends.

617
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,440
They fired me, Barney.

618
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,720
I guess it's somethin'
I haven't got through my head yet.

619
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,640
So they fired ya, huh?
Well, well.

620
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:28,360
You know, from where I sit, it looks as
though that McCloud just did ya a big favour.

621
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,720
He done me a big favour too.

622
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,320
'Cause it gives me a chance to speak
what's been on my mind for a long time.

623
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,960
Listen, son. I'm getting old,
kind of stiff in the saddle.

624
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:44,720
I need a partner, a man with some
guts under his belt, like you.

625
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,960
Come on in with me, Murray. What we've
made before will be just nothing'.

626
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,520
We can make ourselves
a real killing'.

627
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,080
Well, one thing I'll tell you:

628
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,000
Bucks thinks he can run
this division without me.

629
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,000
All right. Let him try.

630
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,760
What was it this time?
Same old thing.

631
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,280
Stock train piled up
this side of Smoky Creek.

632
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:11,600
You look a sight. I saw you
comin' and put the coffee on.

633
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,600
Fine.

634
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,200
I guess bad luck, like they say,
comes all in a lump.

635
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,120
This ain't no "bad luck"...
bridges burned, switches left open,

636
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,760
journals sanded,
freight lost in shipment,

637
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,200
cattle stolen
from right out of the cars.

638
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:32,560
No. This is something
that's all been figured out.

639
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,400
Do we know who's doing it?

640
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,880
Don't ask me that. Of course
we know who's doing it!

641
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,520
And so does everybody
from here to Cheyenne!

642
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:48,440
If he only had the wit
to realize it, the fool!

643
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,840
Guaranteed
Cherokee Indian snake oil!

644
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:58,040
Folks, it'll cure anything that
happens to be wrong with you.

645
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:01,680
I had a woman who come to me not long
ago. This woman suffered from insomnia.

646
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,720
I've got a letter from her here.
I want to read you this letter.

647
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,960
It says here,
"Unless you leave town immedia..."

648
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,200
No, that's not it.
That's a personal letter, my friends.

649
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,080
I'll drop you off here, huh? I thought we were
going to spend a quiet evening with Emmy and Bill.

650
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:22,760
This genuine Indian snake oil... Maybe that's
what you need, honey... a shot of snake oil.

651
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:26,000
You've sure been looking
kind of puny. Have I?

652
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:30,720
Yeah, kind of mopey, puttering
around the house like a sick hen.

653
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,840
I'm sorry, Murray.
And stop being sorry so much.

654
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,640
Every time I open my mouth,
you're sorry.

655
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,800
I'm sorry, honey.
Now you've got me doing it.

656
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:44,640
Hello, Murray. Hi
there! How's my big boy?

657
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:48,080
The wife.

658
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,520
Friends of Rebstock's.
Yes. I should imagine.

659
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,920
Well, if it ain't the little lady herself,
slick as a daisy and twice as pretty.

660
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,560
I sure am sorry if the boys have been
disturbing your sleep these nights.

661
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,880
I keep telling 'em, but sometimes
they don't realize they're not at home.

662
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,600
Well, l... Maybe I'll go
and get myself a drink,

663
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,200
and, uh, I'll be seeing ya, huh?
Yeah.

664
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,800
Why didn't you just spit in his eye
and get it over with?

665
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,720
Marian,
what's come over you lately?

666
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,120
Nothing.
You're not fooling me.

667
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:37,120
A man knows when he's not wanted, when he's
being treated like he was poison or something.

668
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,600
That's not true, Murray.
Yes, it is.

669
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,640
Instead of sulking
around like a spoiled kid,

670
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,920
if you've got something against me,
why don't you say so?

671
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,960
All right. I'll tell you.
I haven't changed, Murray.

672
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,520
You have. Something
terrible has happened to you.

673
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,600
I knew before you opened your mouth
it would be my fault.

674
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:01,080
I didn't say it was your fault...
not entirely. It's your friends'.

675
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:06,160
My friends? Suppose you leave them
out of it? But I can't, Murray.

676
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:10,040
Because, whatever you're doing,
and I'm sure it's something terribly wrong,

677
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,400
I know these men
are the cause of it.

678
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,520
They're wicked men, Murray!
I said, leave them out of it.

679
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,360
I'll talk to you later.

680
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,280
Oh, Luke.

681
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,440
Now, Marian.

682
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:01,480
Oh, Luke, I'm such a fool.
Please forgive me.

683
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:08,680
When did you get in?
A couple of hours ago.

684
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,760
What brought you back?

685
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:15,040
Bucks wired me to come.
Bucks?

686
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:20,640
Is it that bad? I'm afraid the
division's had about all it can take.

687
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,120
Murray.

688
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,400
Oh, Luke, please talk to him.

689
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,040
You're his oldest friend.
He'll listen to you. He must!

690
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:42,040
Marian! How's my honey?
Where'd you pop up from?

691
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:45,360
I came in with Murray. Is
Emmy inside? Yeah, go on in.

692
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,320
She'll be glad to see you.

693
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,880
Bill, you...
you doing anything special?

694
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:56,200
No.
Come on. Let's take a walk.

695
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,920
Mr. Smith.!
Hello, Sheriff.

696
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,960
Say, you look a little peaked.
Well, if I ain't glad to see you.

697
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,360
Since you've been gone this dang
railroad has been running me ragged.

698
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,320
We sure have. One time, we
almost had him on his horse,

699
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,600
only he'd lost his horse.

700
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,280
Now, that ain't kindly, Bill.
It ain't for a fact.

701
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,600
Have you seen Murray? Murray? Yes,
he's in Pete's Saloon. I just left him.

702
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,040
Now, Mr. Smith... Eh... Thanks.

703
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,080
Well...

704
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:41,200
Care for me, care for me
If we meet in Laramie

705
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:46,080
Maybe she'll marry me
Gotta go and see, whoo, whoo

706
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:05,360
- Hello, Smitty.
- Hello, Murray.

707
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,320
- So you're back, huh?
- Looks that way.

708
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,760
And, boy, it's a sight
for sore eyes to see ya. Yes, sir.

709
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,400
- What'll it be, son?
- Not a thing, Rebstock.

710
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:22,480
I'd like to talk to you, Murray.

711
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:37,040
This Smith,
he's gonna start crowding us.

712
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:40,920
All right. We'll see who can
crowd hardest with the most.

713
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,400
Murray, you've been
around the railroad a long time.

714
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:03,040
You know how powerful they are.
You can't buck 'em.

715
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:07,160
Yeah? Go on.

716
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,760
Well, a lot of things have happened
since I've been away.

717
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:14,560
What's that got to do with me?

718
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:22,040
I, uh... I just came in
from Crawling Stone Flats.

719
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,960
Yeah?

720
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,360
You were there when that last
trainload of beef was ditched.

721
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:32,840
You're crazy.
No, Murray.

722
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:36,760
The sorrel gelding of yours threw
a shoe. I picked it up at the wreck.

723
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:40,120
I also talked to the man
who reshod the horse the next day.

724
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:44,120
- Are you figuring' to tie me into that wreck?
- No. It's a little tougher than that.

725
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,560
I'm figuring on giving you some advice.

726
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,720
Well, what do you know?

727
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,960
Murray,
this town's gone sour on you...

728
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,600
Medicine Bend,
the whole territory...

729
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,880
and I don't know
how you can sweeten it.

730
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,600
You just got off on the wrong foot
with the wrong people.

731
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,160
Wrong people?

732
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,160
So Marian's been crying'
on your shoulder, huh?

733
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,960
Marian has nothing to do with it.

734
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:13,640
I've had Rebstock
taped out for a long while.

735
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,640
He's poisonous... murder.

736
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,760
Yeah. Go on.
But keep it funny.

737
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:25,960
All right. You and Rebstock
are in this up to your necks.

738
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,520
I could pin it on you
from any angle.

739
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:33,640
You know, Smith, I was just wondering why I
ever thought you were something extra special.

740
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,680
Well, here's my advice, Murray.
Pull out. It's a big country.

741
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,480
Go someplace you like.
Get a fresh start.

742
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:46,680
- Pull out?
- Yes, pull out. I can cover up for you.

743
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,200
My old pal.

744
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,800
Just full of brotherly love
and charity, aren't you?

745
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,000
Why, you're trying to frame me,
that's what.

746
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,560
You know better than that, Murray.
Sure, you are.!

747
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,680
Me out of the way and you have
a clear track with Marian.

748
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,400
Slipped a long ways, haven't you?

749
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,280
What's the matter, Smith?
Does he make you nervous?

750
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,760
You losing your touch?

751
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,880
Don't let it worry ya.

752
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,200
That's only the first round.

753
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,520
Oh, hello, Bill. Luke.
Emmy.

754
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,600
Emmy.

755
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,040
It wasn't any use, was it?

756
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,200
No.

757
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,080
I'm gonna leave him, Luke.

758
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:34,560
Marian, you can't do that.

759
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,880
If you leave him now,
he's finished.

760
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,840
What else can I do?

761
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:45,600
Every night,
he's with those unspeakable men,

762
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,120
here in town, out at the ranch.

763
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,120
They're destroying him, Luke.

764
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:58,320
Marian, I know how you feel.

765
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,560
Half the time,
I feel that way about him myself.

766
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:06,760
But we can't let him down now.

767
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:11,240
Right now, he needs you more
than he's ever needed anybody in his life.

768
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,600
But what can I do?

769
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,240
Take him away,

770
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,080
make him sell the ranch,
leave here.

771
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,480
I've tried and failed.

772
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,760
Now it's up to you.

773
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,920
Is that what you
really want me to do?

774
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:40,280
It's more than that.

775
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,720
It's what you must do.

776
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,800
It's his only chance.

777
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:49,160
Marian.! Marian.!

778
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,480
Let's finish the game at Murray's.

779
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:57,040
I say, do you think
she's gonna like this?

780
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:21,200
We'll wait for you, Murray.
Okay.

781
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,520
Yes.

782
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:58,840
Look, honey. Did you really mean what
you said on the way home tonight...

783
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,080
about us leaving here?

784
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,960
Yes.

785
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,880
You're sure that's what you want?

786
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,520
It's the only way, Murray.

787
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:23,120
I'm sure of it.

788
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,680
Well, that's all I want to know.
Where are you going?

789
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,280
I'm gonna ride a ways with Barney.

790
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:35,200
There's a... little deal
I've got to clean up with him.

791
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:37,160
You better get yourself some sleep.

792
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Let's go.
Come on.

793
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,680
All right. Don't move.
Put 'em up!

794
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:47,560
Second section of Number Three. They jumped
her while she was taking water at Tower "W."

795
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,560
Killed the guard
and got away with all the money.

796
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,640
"They"? Who's "they"? We don't
know. They were all masked.

797
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,200
Sheriff, how long would it take you to
round up a dozen men who can ride and shoot?

798
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:58,760
Why, uh, you'll have all the
men you need in half an hour.

799
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:01,600
Good. Bill, you get an
engine and two stock cars.

800
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,680
Have them spotted at the
loading corral. Right away.

801
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:07,240
McCloud, I want a clear track
from here to Tower "W."

802
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:11,120
Smith, I can ride, and I can shoot.
I wish you'd let me come along.

803
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:15,120
I feel partly responsible for this.
Sure, I'd be glad to have you.

804
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,720
Thanks.

805
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:28,040
Got that straight, Sheriff? We ride to Williams
Canyon, turn back anybody who tries to get in.

806
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:31,040
That's right.
We'll pick up the trail at Tower "W."

807
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,960
If it's Rebstock's outfit, we should
have 'em between us this afternoon.

808
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,880
All right. Good luck, boys. Same
to you, Mr. Smith. Come on. Hup!

809
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:44,520
All set? They've got a three-hour
head start on us. We've got to travel.

810
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:49,440
Luke, take care of him, won't you? Bill, I
mean. Sure, I'll keep my eye on him, Emmy.

811
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,120
Look out for yourself
too, will you? Yeah.

812
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:04,160
It's hard to tell, Mr. Smith. It all
happened so fast. How many were there?

813
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,280
Not more than six.
Anyone you know?

814
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:09,640
Uh-uh. Anyone you could
identify if you saw 'em again?

815
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:12,840
No. You see, they all had
handkerchiefs over... Wait a minute.

816
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,440
Yeah, one of them had
long hair, sort of whitish.

817
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,640
Yeah,
I could nail him anyplace.

818
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:22,120
Du Sang. Well, thanks,
Woody. You've done fine.

819
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,400
Well, that kind of ties things
together. Yeah, the Rebstock outfit.

820
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:28,840
All right, boys. Get goin'. A little fast riding,
you can catch up with the sheriff's outfit.

821
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:31,320
I'll meet you at Williams
Canyon. Good luck, Smitty!

822
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:34,720
So long, boys! Good luck!
Good hunting, boys!

823
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:41,280
Smitty, is Murray in this? I don't know.
That's what I gotta find out. Come on.

824
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:52,200
Hello, Marian.
Hello, Luke.

825
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:55,080
Murray home?
No.

826
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,440
Do you know where he is?

827
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:01,120
He rode out with Rebstock...
last night.

828
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,880
Where's Karg?
He went with him.

829
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,360
And Seagrue?
Yes.

830
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,440
Have you any idea where they went?

831
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,280
To Williams Canyon,
at least I think so.

832
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,120
You see, last night on the way home,

833
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:22,120
I talked to Murray,
just as you asked me to.

834
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:25,840
I finally persuaded him
that we should go away.

835
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:30,080
Then he got the idea
of selling out to Rebstock.

836
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,760
What's the matter, Luke?

837
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:39,560
Early this morning at Tower "W,"
Rebstock's outfit held up Number Three.

838
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,240
Made off with a lot of money.

839
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,560
The worst of it was they killed a guard.

840
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,280
Do you think Murray had any part in it?

841
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:52,080
I wish I could say no.

842
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,560
Marian, you'd better go to Emmy's.

843
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:26,120
There we are. This is your share,
Murray, and this is for your ranch.

844
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:29,120
There's yours, Whitey.
Well, boys, I guess that's it.

845
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:34,800
What is it, Barney,
the thin end?

846
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,160
Barney.! Barney.!

847
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,600
They're comin', Barney.
Who's comin'?

848
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:45,120
Smith, with a posse! I told you
they'd be here, you murdering half-wit!

849
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,720
Well, it's no use talking about that now!
Get your rifles, men!

850
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,520
One man behind a rock is worth three
in the open. Barney, you're crazy!

851
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,480
I'm getting outta here the
back way! This is a hanging'!

852
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,200
I'm with ya, Murray. Me
too. So you're running, huh?

853
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:58,840
Fine thing. A man thinks he's got men
behind him, but when the chips are down...

854
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:02,000
Aw... Aw, well, never
mind me. Come on, boys.

855
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:05,960
Get on your way. I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll keep 'em here just as long as I possibly can.

856
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:11,240
So good-bye, boys,
and good luck!

857
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,160
Barney.

858
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,400
Whitey, what are you doing here?

859
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,560
You'd better get out of here, son.
It's you they're coming after.

860
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,560
Got it fixed up
all nice and pretty, ain't ya?

861
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:30,200
For yourself. You stay behind
and give us a nice head start,

862
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:33,080
then you meet the posse
and throw it all off onto us.

863
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:36,800
Oh, now, Whitey, son,
you know perfectly well that l...

864
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,800
They got Baggs.!

865
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,520
Give him the best ya got, Doc.

866
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,800
McCloud, you'd
better stay here with him.

867
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,600
All right, boys. Let's go.

868
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:44,400
Sounds like
somebody got behind us.

869
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:47,760
Keep pressing 'em, Sheriff. I'm
going on back. Right. Come on!

870
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,760
Come on, Bill!

871
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:01,000
One of you boys better help me plug up this
hole. I left a trail a blind man could follow.

872
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,240
I'll get it, Murray.

873
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:14,800
Looks like it went
plumb through.

874
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,840
Come on. Let's get out of here! Yeah.

875
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:35,200
Ho!

876
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:00,880
What's the matter?
Out of range.

877
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,560
Out of range, my eye.

878
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:08,720
You could've hit 'im
with a beanshooter.

879
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,640
Come on.

880
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,560
All right, Marian. Get your things
together. We're getting out of here.

881
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:03,200
Well, what are you waiting for?
You want me to sell out and go.

882
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:06,040
You were at Tower "W."

883
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,560
What do you know
about Tower "W"?

884
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,640
Who told you?
Come on. Who told you?

885
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:15,240
Was it Smith? Was he here?
Yes.

886
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:25,320
So that's it.
You were running out on me.

887
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:29,360
No, Murray! No, I was only...

888
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,800
Might as well get this
through your head, Marian.

889
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:36,880
You'll never go with Smith
or anyone else as long as I'm alive.

890
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:40,360
Now, pick up your stuff.

891
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,320
No, Murray! Don't! If you do, they'll
never stop until they hang you.

892
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:57,640
Then go out there and get rid
of em. If you don't, I will.

893
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:09,680
- Why didn't you go to Emmy?
- I had some things to do. I had to pack.

894
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,480
Luke!

895
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,560
I suppose Murray hasn't
come back yet.

896
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,600
No.

897
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,880
No, not yet.

898
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:36,880
If he does, tell him it's best
he gives himself up.

899
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:54,360
Well, that's one time
you kissed him off fast.

900
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,960
All right. Now, get the
buckboard, and hurry.

901
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,960
Murray,
you must give yourself up.

902
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,960
You can't go on...
Yeah, Smitty'd like that.

903
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,320
You heard me.
Get the buckboard.

904
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:15,320
Marian.

905
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,240
Luke!

906
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:21,240
Oh, Luke, why did you come back?

907
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,560
Why? Why?
Murray's in the house, isn't he?

908
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:26,880
Yes, but he's hurt badly.

909
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,480
You and Bill go get the doc.
I'll stay here and see if I can help him.

910
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:35,640
Oh, Luke, please don't go in there.
Please don't!

911
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:38,360
He's crazy.
He's like a madman.

912
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,440
Get goin', Bill.
Get that buckboard out of here fast.

913
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,560
Watch your step, Smitty.
Come on, Marian.

914
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:57,080
Giddyap!

915
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:59,040
Hyah!

916
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:04,040
Marian! Marian! Marian!

917
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,320
I'm coming in, Murray.

918
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,480
Hiya, Smitty.

919
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:55,520
Hi, yourself.

920
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,360
Is it bad?

921
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:13,600
Yeah. Bad.

922
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,960
Try to take it easy, Murray.

923
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:20,000
I sent for the doc.
You're wasting his time.

924
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,880
That last one almost cut me in half.

925
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:30,400
Here, let me...
Get your hand away!

926
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,640
I'm sorry.

927
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:40,760
Forget it.

928
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,720
Well, that's how it goes.

929
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,680
Ya gotta have the breaks.

930
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:53,840
You had 'em all, Murray.

931
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:59,920
I had one, anyway.

932
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:03,120
I had Marian.

933
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:08,840
That's one break you didn't get.

934
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:15,520
Get me a drink, would ya?
It's on the table.

935
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:19,560
Sure.

936
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,840
Smitty.

937
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:58,920
Murray, if there'd been any other way,
I'd have played it differently.

938
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,440
You know that, don't you?

939
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:10,960
The only cards I had
were the ones you dealt me.
