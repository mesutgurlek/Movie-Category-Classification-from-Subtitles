JP Harrah. Wait till I get
some of the soap out of my eyes.

I heard you were made sheriff...

36
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:27,343
- What's the idea of the gun ?
- Just ' till I find out 
which side you're on, Cole.

37
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:30,719
- What do you mean ?
- I heard you were working  for Bart Jason.

Well, Nothing's set yet.

39
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:39,104
He offered me good money, but I haven't
found out what I have to do to earn it.

00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:42,777
- Would you like to hear ?
- Yeah, go ahead.

41
00:03:42,865 --> 00:03:45,949
Cole, that's about  close enough to that gun.

42
00:03:46,034 --> 00:03:49,949
I just wanted to see
if you'd slowed down any.

43
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:52,029
Not that much.

44
00:03:52,624 --> 00:03:55,032
What were you saying about Jason ?

45
00:03:55,126 --> 00:03:59,171
Well, he showed up here around the end
of the war with a pocket full of money.

46
00:03:59,255 --> 00:04:01,627
Nobody seems to be able to
find out where he got it from...

47
00:04:01,716 --> 00:04:04,337
but...everybody else
around here was broke.

48
00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:07,511
- You know how it was then.
- Yeah, all over Texas.

49
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:11,760
Well,having money, he started to grow.
Now, he can't grow any bigger until
he gets more water.

50
00:04:11,934 --> 00:04:13,973
There's only one place to get it.

Trouble is, somebody was there
ahead of him. About 20 years ahead.

A man named Kevin MacDonald got here

when there was nothing
but Indians and coyotes.

54
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:26,109
Mr. MacDonald's got four boys
and a girl, and they've all worked real hard.

55
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:29,946
They hung together through 
all the rough times,and now that 
things are beginning to look up,

56
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:32,739
MacDonald's in no mind to sell.

57
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:37,123
So he's holding and Jason's pushing...
and I'm standing right in the middle.

58
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,960
It's not the way it was told to me.

59
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:44,172
That's the way it is, Cole, I guess
you're supposed to take care of me.

60
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,592
Well, not that I couldn't...do it, Harrah,
but...I don't think I'd like that.

61
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:53,093
I'm glad to hear you say that.

62
00:04:53,265 --> 00:04:56,431
Not that I couldn't handle you...
but...I don't think I'd like that either.

63
00:04:56,643 --> 00:05:01,720
Suppose I tell Jason that
I had a long talk with you and...

64
00:05:01,898 --> 00:05:04,306
and you scared me off.

65
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:06,726
- Good enough ?
- Good enough.

66
00:05:06,861 --> 00:05:10,028
You can put that thing down now.

about that gun.

the way you had yours.

No, you never mentioned that.
Up until now, I thought you had good taste.

- You know something,Cole, I think
We better get ourselves a new girl.

00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:13,752
- Yeah.
- You better not.
-Why not ?

86
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:16,628
I'm girl enough for you both.
Say,can I buy you a drink ?

87
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:23,006
Well, I'd like that very much,
but I promised JP I'd do something
for him, didn't I ?

88
00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:26,268
- Yes, you did.
- Of Course, if you want 
to do my errand...

89
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:28,725
No, you do your own work, Cole.

90
00:06:28,897 --> 00:06:32,765
- Will you buy us that drink
a couple of hours from now ?
- Yeah, sure will.

91
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,315
Where is this Bart Jason's place ?

92
00:06:35,404 --> 00:06:37,776
You take the main road
north out of town.

93
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:40,735
And after you cross the creek,
and you come to a big rock.

-Yeah.

96
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,872
You ride east from there 
about 3 miles and you get 
to Bart Jason's ranch.

I know I don't.
That's why I want to.

- Yeah, well, Cole always 
was pretty lucky.

294
00:24:33,469 --> 00:24:37,597
- Maudie, get him a glass, will you ?
- Well, what'll we drink to first ?

295
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,010
Maudie...

296
00:24:40,517 --> 00:24:43,601
I guess I should have told you.

297
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,102
Hmh...Cole, sometimes you...

#  [ Guitar ]

299
00:24:55,782 --> 00:24:59,400
I was hoping to see
you alone before you left.

300
00:24:59,577 --> 00:25:03,740
- It's better this way, Maudie.
- Come back, will you ?

301
00:25:03,831 --> 00:25:08,208
- I will when...
- When you can forget 
Luke MacDonald ?

302
00:25:08,293 --> 00:25:12,671
When you can look at
the other MacDonalds and
not...not feel you owe them ?

303
00:25:13,465 --> 00:25:16,632
Pretty wise for a kid, Maudie.

304
00:25:16,843 --> 00:25:22,182
I think you must be the
only person who thinks of
me as a kid, Cole.

305
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,430
I reckon I really don't.

306
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:27,099
Please don't.

307
00:25:35,611 --> 00:25:38,066

Hey !

00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,599
That the way you make your living ?

311
00:26:11,687 --> 00:26:14,937
By golly, Cole,
it sure is good to see you.

312
00:26:15,023 --> 00:26:17,693
What sheriff had to hire you
for a deputy ?

313
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,148
You're looking
at him.   Hi ya, Cole !

314

Dodd Draper !
The last time I saw you two,

315
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:27,696
you were ten jumps ahead 
of a posse raisin' dust 
for Mexico.

316
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:32,531
- Hey, heard you got shot.
- Yeah, but that was six or 
seven months ago.

317
00:26:32,623 --> 00:26:35,577
How about supper ?
And I'll buy you a beer, too.

318
00:26:35,668 --> 00:26:37,910
We'd like to, but we're working men.

319
00:26:38,045 --> 00:26:41,794
How about that cantina
up the street ?
Good place to eat ?

320
00:26:41,966 --> 00:26:45,132
- Good as any. You sticking around ?
- Day or two.

321
00:26:45,219 --> 00:26:48,089
Well, we'll see you later, Cole.

Bring something to eat, 
comidas....Plenty of it
-Si Señor.

327
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:20,080
- Right away.
- Something to drink, also, vamanos.

328

A Five and a one.

- Charlie Hagan.
- Yeah.

331
00:28:37,158 --> 00:28:39,530
You want something from me ?

332
00:28:40,203 --> 00:28:43,572
- You don't remember me, do you ?
- No.

333

- Do you remember this hat ?
- Well, why in the hell would
I remember a hat ?  [ Laughter ]

Si, Señor, si

Who was this fellow I killed ?
A friend of yours ?

338
00:29:05,268 --> 00:29:07,178
You could say that.

339
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:12,810
- When did I do this, boy ?
- Two years ago, come September.

340
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,273
You and three others.

341
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:18,860
Natchez-Under-the-Hill,
on the Mississippi.

342
00:29:19,949 --> 00:29:26,117
He was a gambler, named
Johnny Diamond...
and he was kind of an old man.

343
00:29:27,831 --> 00:29:32,209
- Shouldn't have taken four of you.
- Do you remember, Charlie ?

344
00:29:32,294 --> 00:29:35,793
I remember. He was a cardsharp.
He was cheating.

345
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:39,629
No...no, he was good.
He didn't have to cheat.

346
00:29:39,718 --> 00:29:44,296
- It shouldn't have taken 4 of you, Joey.
- No, it shouldn't of.

347
00:29:45,098 --> 00:29:50,092
Well, I'm sure glad you
remember, Mr. Hagan.
The other three did.

348
00:29:50,603 --> 00:29:54,897
- The other three ?
- Yeah, I caught up with them.

349
00:29:55,608 --> 00:29:57,980
You're the last.

350
00:30:00,446 --> 00:30:02,652
And now I think you better stand up.

351
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,986
Stand up, Charlie.
I'm curious to see how he does this.

352
00:30:07,202 --> 00:30:09,242
He doesn't have a gun.

353
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:13,279
And like he said,
it shouldn't have
taken four of you.

354
00:30:18,213 --> 00:30:20,289
Stand up, Charlie.

00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:43,733
You with the hat.

356
00:30:52,829 --> 00:30:55,498
You killed Charlie
'cause he killed your 
friend, right ?

357
00:30:56,457 --> 00:30:59,791
- That's right.
- Well, it happens, Charlie was
a good friend of mine.

358
00:30:59,961 --> 00:31:02,416
So let's see you
do that trick twice.

[ Gunshot with Ricochet
and gun dropping ]

360

- You.

- Always seems to take more
than one doesn't it ?

364
00:31:17,602 --> 00:31:19,809
That's because they're no good.

365
00:31:19,938 --> 00:31:22,607
- Pick up your gun.
- What ?

366
00:31:22,816 --> 00:31:27,276
You want to try again, now ?
Pick up your gun.

00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:38,028
- Me first.
- Why should you go first ?

369
00:31:38,122 --> 00:31:40,161
- Pick it up.
- Now, just a second...

Tell me about it later !
-I'll tell you now !

in me, don't you, Nelse ?

375

Faith can move mountains,
Milt, but it can't beat

off your range, aren't you ?

- No.

- Yeah, sure.

What would you say if
I tried to hire you on?

393
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:15,244
- First I'd ask about the money.
- Money's good.

394
00:33:15,339 --> 00:33:17,462
Then I'd ask about the job.

Well, good evening.
Thanks for the drink, gentlemen.

- Just a minute, son.
- I am not your son.

- Lord Almighty.
- Yeah.

00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,892
That's why most people call me
Mississippi.

400
00:33:32,981 --> 00:33:35,816
- Mississippi ?
- I was born on the river in a flat boat.

401
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,067
You're pretty good with that knife.
Can you use a gun ?

402
00:33:39,195 --> 00:33:43,656
If I could, I'd be using one.
Good evening.

403
00:33:43,825 --> 00:33:46,113
Just a minute, Mississippi.

404
00:33:46,285 --> 00:33:50,235
Would you mind telling
me why you have such a
great passion for my company ?

405
00:33:50,331 --> 00:33:53,450
Will you just relax
for a couple of minutes ?

406
00:33:53,542 --> 00:33:55,618
You were telling me
about the job.

407
00:33:55,711 --> 00:33:58,581
There's a little range war
up in the El Dorado country.

408
00:33:58,714 --> 00:34:02,165
El Dorado ?
Mind telling me 
who hired you ?

409
00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:06,090
Fellow named Bart Jason.
Do you know him ?

410
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:11,173
We met. He offered me
the job a few months back.
I didn't take it.

411
00:34:12,143 --> 00:34:14,301
Do you know who 
you're up against ?

412
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:17,230
Yeah. The sheriff, JP Harrah.

413
00:34:17,315 --> 00:34:19,852
I understand he used to be
pretty good with a gun.

414
00:34:20,026 --> 00:34:23,192
Not just pretty good, McLeod.
He's the...

415
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:26,979
- The fourth man you told me about.
- That's right.

416
00:34:27,157 --> 00:34:29,695
Well, he used to be.
He's not any more.

417
00:34:29,827 --> 00:34:33,160
- Well, what happened ?
- What usually happens to a man ?

418
00:34:33,246 --> 00:34:35,073
A woman.

419
00:34:35,165 --> 00:34:39,376
Seems like he tangled with
some wandering petticoat...
he's been drunk ever since.

420
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:44,837
You figure to move in before
he sobers up, or...before
they get a new sheriff ?

421
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:48,884
- And you're not coming in ?
- No.

422
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,674
I suppose you have your reasons.

423
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,974
It's probably just as well.

424
00:34:55,142 --> 00:34:57,467
With two like us in
the same bunch...

425
00:34:57,561 --> 00:35:00,597
sooner or later we'd have
to find out which one
of us was faster.

426
00:35:02,941 --> 00:35:05,611
Yeah, I guess you're right.

427
00:35:07,195 --> 00:35:09,235
So long, Thornton.

428
00:35:11,783 --> 00:35:13,941
I thought we were going.

429
00:35:14,828 --> 00:35:17,200
Mississippi, just listen.

430
00:35:18,331 --> 00:35:23,289
McLeod, would you like
to walk out that door first,
ahead of us ?

431
00:35:23,419 --> 00:35:26,586
Nope.   I don't believe I would.

432
00:35:26,797 --> 00:35:29,917
I didn't think so.

433
00:35:30,968 --> 00:35:33,007
Pedro, Milt, can you hear me ?

434
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,920
- We hear you.
- I'm coming out.

435
00:35:38,684 --> 00:35:40,703
Where are you ?

436
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:45,142
- Jeffe...over here.
- Come on out.

437
00:35:49,444 --> 00:35:51,732
Further into the light, hurry.

438
00:35:53,823 --> 00:35:55,815
Now drop your guns.

439
00:36:01,956 --> 00:36:03,995
Come here.

440
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,209
Inside.

441
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:15,626
- That all right, Thornton ?
- Good enough.

442
00:36:15,802 --> 00:36:18,673
Mississippi, get their guns.

443
00:36:18,847 --> 00:36:22,891
If it's all right with you,
McLeod,  we'll drop 'em at
the sheriff's office

444
00:36:22,976 --> 00:36:26,179
and your boys can
pick 'em up on their
way out of town.

445
00:36:26,354 --> 00:36:30,186
- Sounds reasonable.
- Much obliged.

446
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:32,973
Call it professional courtesy.

447
00:36:42,828 --> 00:36:44,867
Want to get something
to eat, Mississippi ?

448
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:50,625
Mr. Thornton, I would've walked
out of here and right into those two
fellas if you hadn't stopped me.

449
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,746
- I asked if you were hungry.
- I'm trying to thank you.

450
00:36:53,748 --> 00:36:57,622
I'm hungry !   That shivaree
you put on in there
interrupted my supper.

451
00:36:57,717 --> 00:36:59,756
It wore out our welcome.

452
00:36:59,844 --> 00:37:02,086
Now, we'll have to find
someplace else to eat.

453
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:05,596
- Now ?
- Now.

454
00:37:18,221 --> 00:37:20,321
¿ Que quieres mas ?

455
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:22,563
She wants to know
if you want something else.

456
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,322
Just coffee.

457
00:37:25,323 --> 00:37:26,323
Café, por favor.

458
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:33,745
- Not very hungry huh ?
- No, not so much.

459
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:38,748
- A little green around the gills.
- Yep.

460
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,668
I just finished something tonight
I've been two years doing.

461
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:46,005
What are you figuring on
doing next ?  Going back
to the river ?

462
00:37:46,221 --> 00:37:50,219
I haven't thought
much about what I'm
going to do next.

463
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,431
The river won't be
the same without old...

464
00:37:52,602 --> 00:37:56,730
Well, if you're going to stay
around here, I've got two pieces
of advice for you...

465
00:37:56,815 --> 00:38:01,192
Get rid of that hat.
Learn how to use a gun.

466
00:38:01,277 --> 00:38:04,563
- I don't figure on gettin'
rid of that hat.
- No ?

467
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:07,029
No.

468
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,704
Johnny Diamond, he's
the friend I...ah...
the man that raised me.

469
00:38:14,498 --> 00:38:20,417
All he left behind was
a gold watch and this hat.

470
00:38:20,587 --> 00:38:25,498
I had to sell that gold watch
a year or so back.

471
00:38:25,675 --> 00:38:29,543
So, I guess
I'll just hang on to that hat.

472
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:32,929
What about learning to use a gun ?

473
00:38:33,057 --> 00:38:35,928
Johnny didn't believe in guns.
He always thought that...

474
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:38,723
He's dead.   Think about that.

475
00:38:40,189 --> 00:38:43,225
Unless you can learn to
stay out of trouble.

476
00:38:43,317 --> 00:38:47,611
That's one thing even old Johnny
couldn't teach me to do.

477
00:38:47,696 --> 00:38:52,025
Well, I'll be moving along.
Good luck to you.

478
00:38:52,743 --> 00:38:55,946
Ah...you don't suppose
I could ride along with ya ?

479
00:38:56,121 --> 00:38:58,790
- Nope.
- That's plain enough.

480
00:38:58,874 --> 00:39:03,167
- Well, I hope everything 
works out all right.
- What works out ?

481
00:39:03,378 --> 00:39:05,620
Whatever it is you're going to do.

482
00:39:06,798 --> 00:39:10,083
Pay for the meal, will you ?
So long.

483
00:39:15,339 --> 00:39:17,879
#

484
00:39:48,879 --> 00:39:51,453
Hold it, Cochise.

485
00:39:51,632 --> 00:39:54,716
Steady boy. lt'll take a minute.

486
00:40:10,627 --> 00:40:13,227
Cole !   Cole Thornton !

487
00:40:13,528 --> 00:40:15,567
Where are you ?

488
00:40:16,739 --> 00:40:20,523
Close enough to blow
your hat off if I hadn't 'a
recognised it.

489
00:40:29,626 --> 00:40:33,754
- What are you doing here ?
- Looking for you.

490
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,539
Don't you know
better than to follow
a man that way ?

491
00:40:37,634 --> 00:40:40,588
- Sorry, I don't know 
there's another way.
- You almost got shot.

492
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,638
- You fall off your horse ?
- Yeah.

493
00:40:43,723 --> 00:40:45,431
- You hurt ?
- No.

494
00:40:45,517 --> 00:40:47,556
Well, there's something
the matter with you.

495
00:40:47,644 --> 00:40:52,222
Well look, I've got a
bullet in my back, sometimes it
presses against something and...

496
00:40:52,398 --> 00:40:57,309
I get a screaming pain,  then
there's nothing...it goes numb,
and I can't use this hand.

497
00:40:57,486 --> 00:41:01,698
- How long does that last ?
- Just for a while.   Why are
you following me ?

498
00:41:03,117 --> 00:41:05,690
Well, I got to thinkin' about
what you're going to do.

499
00:41:06,495 --> 00:41:08,534
And just what am I gonna do ?

500
00:41:08,622 --> 00:41:14,375
You're going to that town,
El Dorado, to help your friend
against McLeod and his bunch.

501
00:41:14,502 --> 00:41:17,172
How do you know
he's my friend ?

502
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:21,294
That look on your face
when you heard he'd
turned into a drunk.

503
00:41:22,135 --> 00:41:24,708
Well, this thing's wearing off.

504
00:41:24,804 --> 00:41:27,295
Give me a hand
up on my horse.

505
00:41:31,268 --> 00:41:33,973
You sure your friend's
worth helping ?

506
00:41:34,188 --> 00:41:39,229
You just spent two years
chasing some fellas that
killed a friend of yours.

507
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:42,568
You think your friend
was worth two years ?

508
00:41:42,654 --> 00:41:46,782
- I guess I asked a fool question.
- You did.

509
00:42:04,049 --> 00:42:07,216
Give him a breather.
Slow him down.

510
00:42:07,303 --> 00:42:11,964
I was wondering.
Just how good is this McLeod ?

511
00:42:12,182 --> 00:42:17,722
I don't know first hand,
but they say he's one 
of the best.

512
00:42:17,896 --> 00:42:23,317
I figure he'd be pretty mad you...
you turning him down and showing-up
on the other side.

513
00:42:23,401 --> 00:42:26,485
- I hope he is.
- How come ?

514
00:42:26,654 --> 00:42:29,904
Fellow in his business
hasn't got a right to get mad.

515
00:42:30,074 --> 00:42:32,695
He gets mad,
he's not so good.

516
00:42:32,785 --> 00:42:35,952
So the madder he gets,
the better I like it.

517
00:42:36,038 --> 00:42:38,790
Ha !  Sure wish I was
there to see that.

518
00:42:38,874 --> 00:42:41,709
Why do you want to keep
sticking your nose in this ?

519
00:42:41,794 --> 00:42:45,127
Maybe I could help.
You saved my life two times.

520
00:42:45,213 --> 00:42:48,713
But I'm going to be too busy
to keep doing that.

521
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,545
- You can't even use a gun.
- You could teach me.
I need somebody to teach me.

522
00:42:53,638 --> 00:42:56,129
Johnny Diamond always
told me to get the best.

523
00:42:56,224 --> 00:43:00,352
Well, he was right there.
But you're not going to El Dorado.

524
00:43:00,436 --> 00:43:04,303
- Oh, I'm not, huh ?
- No, you're not.

525
00:43:07,276 --> 00:43:11,190
"Gaily bedight,
A gallant knight,

526
00:43:11,405 --> 00:43:15,533
"In sunshine and in shadow,
Had journeyed long..."

527
00:43:15,701 --> 00:43:18,156
- What's that all about ?
- Just a poem.

528
00:43:18,245 --> 00:43:20,284
One of Johnny Diamond's favorites.

529
00:43:20,372 --> 00:43:23,326
Let's see: "Gaily bedight,
A gallant knight,

530
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:28,375
"In sunshine and in shadow,
Had journeyed long,
singing a song,

531
00:43:28,588 --> 00:43:31,375
"In search of El Dorado.

532
00:43:31,466 --> 00:43:36,542
"Over the mountains of the moon,
Down the valley of the shadow,

533
00:43:36,637 --> 00:43:39,472
"Ride, boldly ride..."

534
00:43:39,557 --> 00:43:44,515
Always liked that poem, too.
Makes me want to ah...

535
00:43:44,603 --> 00:43:49,348
Ride, boldly ride ?
Well, it don't work out that way.

536
00:43:49,441 --> 00:43:51,599
I'm learning that.

537
00:43:58,658 --> 00:44:01,529
Oh, Hell !   Hold it, Cochise.

538
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:09,489
- Step down off that horse.
- You always giving people orders ?

539
00:44:14,131 --> 00:44:16,966
You wanted to learn to shoot.

540
00:44:25,434 --> 00:44:27,473
Right out there.

541
00:44:30,897 --> 00:44:35,025
Hold it, Mississippi.
That's no way to use a handgun.

542
00:44:35,109 --> 00:44:39,237
You gotta to draw and fire,
and you gotta be quicker than
somebody else doing the same thing.

543
00:44:39,322 --> 00:44:41,361
Like this.

544
00:44:43,576 --> 00:44:45,533
I see.

545
00:44:51,292 --> 00:44:55,585
- How's that ?
- Were you aiming at that cholla ?

546
00:44:57,005 --> 00:45:01,916
- No, the place you were shooting at.
- 'Fraid it's useless.

547
00:45:02,636 --> 00:45:08,471
Well, we'll be passing through
Cuervo.  I'll have a talk
with the Swede.

548
00:45:08,558 --> 00:45:10,716
Who's the Swede ?

549
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:14,061
An old friend of
mine...a gunsmith.
-Aah !

550
00:45:20,194 --> 00:45:22,233
There's the place.

551
00:45:33,507 --> 00:45:35,207
Why, Cole Thornton !

552
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:39,537
- Swede, good to see you.
- And what brings you around here ?

553
00:45:39,629 --> 00:45:44,587
Well, I'm looking for a
gun for a fella that can't
shoot...Mississippi.

554
00:45:44,676 --> 00:45:46,585
Swede Larson.

555
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:50,592
- Can you help us ?
- Yaha, I think, I've got just the
gun you're looking for.

556
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:52,638
Well good !

557
00:45:54,573 --> 00:45:55,683
Wow !

558
00:45:56,687 --> 00:46:00,305
How wide will that shot spread ?
- Well, now....
- I mean, how big a pattern ?

559
00:46:00,441 --> 00:46:04,272
I don't know.   The fellow
who used it before, he
couldn't see too good.

560
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:07,066
He just shoot where he hear
somebody talk.

561
00:46:07,155 --> 00:46:10,606
- What happened to him ?
- He has a fight in a saloon.

562
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,820
The piano player
he make so much noise,

563
00:46:13,912 --> 00:46:17,530
he couldn't hear the
other man, so he just
shoot the piano player,

564
00:46:17,623 --> 00:46:19,663
and they hung him.

565
00:46:19,751 --> 00:46:22,917
- Looks pretty good to me.
- Shoots good, too.

566
00:46:23,004 --> 00:46:25,162
How about ammunition ?

567
00:46:25,256 --> 00:46:28,956
- Four or five boxes
ought to be enough.
- Good.

568
00:46:29,051 --> 00:46:33,095
- Well, Mississippi, looks
like what you need.
- It sure is !

569
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:37,474
- Pay the man.       ...Swede.
- Cole, you come back soon.

570
00:46:42,147 --> 00:46:45,563
A likely spot to
try that new gun.

571
00:46:55,034 --> 00:46:57,073
Try that cactus.

572
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,220
[ Shotgun Blast ]

573
00:47:09,756 --> 00:47:12,212
You can't miss with that.

574
00:47:13,009 --> 00:47:15,049
It's all right.

575
00:47:22,185 --> 00:47:26,811
- How far is it from here to El Dorado ?
- We'll be in there around midnight.

576
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:33,579
 #

577
00:47:36,573 --> 00:47:38,613
Well, where are we headed ?

578
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,191
- To see a girl.
- To see a girl ?

579
00:47:41,286 --> 00:47:43,445
Yes, a girl.

580
00:47:43,538 --> 00:47:45,994
Don't you think I
could know a girl ?

581
00:47:46,082 --> 00:47:50,080
- I always make you mad, don't I ?
- Mostly.

582
00:47:52,672 --> 00:47:56,005
Hold it...this, yeah !
This is it.

583
00:48:22,811 --> 00:48:25,311
Cole.  Cole !!

584
00:48:25,912 --> 00:48:28,699
Maudie, keep it quiet.
I got to talk to you.

585
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:30,699
I'll let you in.

586
00:48:41,677 --> 00:48:45,093
- Keep your eyes open.
- Oh, You sure pick the 
darnedest times to...

587
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:48,514
- Who's your friend ?
- My name's Alan Bourdillion Traherne.

588
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:52,218
- Just call him Mississippi for now.

with a scar here and a marled eye.

- Nelse McLeod.
- Nelse ? I've heard of him.

so did others.

to have to get over in a hurry.

02:05:14,495 --> 02:05:16,821
Now, stop putting
words in my mouth.

1585
02:05:16,914 --> 02:05:20,579
I just can't do anything
right according to you.
Bull, I need you.

1586
02:05:20,668 --> 02:05:22,993
- You what ?
- I need you, Bull.

1587
02:05:23,087 --> 02:05:26,290
Well, now if you start
being nice to me,
I'll quit you for sure.

1588
02:05:26,382 --> 02:05:30,711
Shock'd be too much.  I'd as
sooner have you hungover
and nasty.

1589
02:05:30,803 --> 02:05:34,800
Speaking of that,
how about a little drink, Bull ?

1590
02:05:36,099 --> 02:05:39,800
Darn it ! Took you a long time
to think of that one.

1591
02:05:41,897 --> 02:05:46,226
- That was good work, sheriff.
- Thank you, friend.

1592
02:05:46,317 --> 02:05:50,860
Sheriff, it looks like
you're going to keep your job.

1593
02:05:50,947 --> 02:05:54,731
Yeah, it'll be a nice quiet town
after you leave, Cole.

1594
02:05:54,825 --> 02:05:57,067
How do you know I'm leaving ?

1595
02:05:57,161 --> 02:06:00,660
We just don't need
your kind around here.

1596
02:06:01,342 --> 02:06:03,182
