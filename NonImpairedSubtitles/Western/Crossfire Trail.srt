1
00:01:01,912 --> 00:01:03,174
Rafe.

2
00:01:03,948 --> 00:01:04,937
Rafe.

3
00:01:12,556 --> 00:01:14,251
You'll do it, Rafe?

4
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,489
You gave me your word.

5
00:01:16,794 --> 00:01:18,125
I'll do it.

6
00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:23,931
I ain't afraid of dying.

7
00:01:24,702 --> 00:01:26,567
What's that you told me?

8
00:01:27,405 --> 00:01:29,771
"'Tis a poor thing
to fear the inevitable."

9
00:01:29,974 --> 00:01:31,202
Right.

10
00:01:31,542 --> 00:01:33,237
Who said it?

11
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,140
Someone who wasn't dying.

12
00:01:39,784 --> 00:01:41,615
That's good advice...

13
00:01:42,086 --> 00:01:43,986
...but hard to follow.

14
00:02:03,908 --> 00:02:05,239
Excuse me.

15
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:08,845
What are you doing, Covington?

16
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:12,140
You don't open the captain's door
without permission.

17
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:16,677
You sure as hell
don't cross that threshold.

18
00:02:19,323 --> 00:02:21,382
I'll beat you within an inch
of your life...

19
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:23,560
...for what you did to Charles Rodney.

20
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:26,355
Charles Rodney got what he deserved.

21
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:27,855
Rafe, come on, we gotta get going.

22
00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:30,686
Cape Mendocino coming up.
We've got to cast off.

23
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,189
That will do it.

24
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,933
Mutiny.

25
00:03:38,736 --> 00:03:39,725
Mutiny.

26
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:42,230
- What's the tariff on that?
- Hanging.

27
00:03:43,774 --> 00:03:45,799
I reckon we better not get caught.

28
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:19,035
You're turned out like a rooster
for the harvest fair.

29
00:04:20,578 --> 00:04:24,571
One lousy shirt. Because he runs off
and leaves a chest full of gold.

30
00:04:24,782 --> 00:04:26,215
The rest wasn't back wages.

31
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:27,315
So what?

32
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:33,908
We need a little
target practice here.

33
00:05:34,218 --> 00:05:36,686
With that you'll
just make them angry.

34
00:05:37,154 --> 00:05:39,213
- One's all we need.
- They're just buffalo.

35
00:05:40,057 --> 00:05:42,491
- They'll be gone soon enough.
- Gone?

36
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,690
They're thick as flies
on a bull's ass!

37
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:51,324
Ten years from now,
they'll be nothing but a memory.

38
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:55,197
A Frenchman, a German and an Irishman
go into a saloon and order whiskeys.

39
00:05:55,406 --> 00:05:57,567
The drinks arrive
with a fly in each one.

40
00:05:57,975 --> 00:06:00,443
The Frenchman says, <i>"Mon dieu!</i>

41
00:06:00,644 --> 00:06:01,975
I can't drink this!"

42
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:05,171
The German flicks the fly out
and drinks it down.

43
00:06:05,382 --> 00:06:09,842
The Irishman grabs the fly,
he turns it upside down and he says:

44
00:06:10,054 --> 00:06:11,521
"Spit it out!

45
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,351
Spit it out!"

46
00:06:19,997 --> 00:06:21,464
How long you staying?

47
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:23,326
Long as it takes.

48
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,533
You, J. T?

49
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:27,403
Long as it takes.

50
00:06:28,072 --> 00:06:29,437
I owe it to Charlie.

51
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,404
What about you, leprechaun?

52
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:37,313
Thanks to our honest friend here,
I'm still a little short on funds.

53
00:06:37,915 --> 00:06:40,713
Those gold mines in Montana
are still calling my name.

54
00:07:02,573 --> 00:07:04,097
'Tis kindly I'm thanking you.

55
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:08,577
Well, I hope you find
your pot of gold, Rock.

56
00:07:11,382 --> 00:07:13,942
May the apple of your eye
see only good...

57
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:17,143
...and may God make smooth
the path before you.

58
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,420
See you in Wyoming
for Christmas goose.

59
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,912
This the Rodney spread?

60
00:07:52,256 --> 00:07:56,488
Forty thousand acres Charlie purchased
from the Sioux Chief Red Cloud.

61
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:03,130
Well, it ain't heaven...

62
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:06,458
...but it's near enough.

63
00:08:07,871 --> 00:08:09,930
Close as we're likely to get.

64
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,235
Why, Mrs. Rodney...

65
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,699
...sure ain't much of a housekeeper.

66
00:09:11,435 --> 00:09:14,370
You get started here, J.T.
I'll be back.

67
00:10:11,328 --> 00:10:13,558
What can I get for you, friend?

68
00:10:14,331 --> 00:10:16,595
I'd like to order some supplies.

69
00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:19,427
Ten pounds each bacon, beans...

70
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:20,762
...flour and coffee.

71
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:23,667
A pound each of sugar, salt, jerky...

72
00:10:24,274 --> 00:10:26,538
...and some rolling tobacco.

73
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,305
A long ride or a long stay?

74
00:10:31,748 --> 00:10:33,340
That the new Centennial model?

75
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:36,383
Yes, sir.

76
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,616
Winchester's first
big-bore lever gun.

77
00:10:39,823 --> 00:10:41,757
That carbine's 45-60.

78
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,659
Case-colored receiver
and factory engraved.

79
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:46,686
Special order?

80
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,624
The customer died before it came in.

81
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,308
Thirty-two dollars.

82
00:11:01,011 --> 00:11:03,309
Fella must have
come into some money.

83
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:21,160
"Moonlight Sonata."

84
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:25,363
You don't look like a man
who knows Beethoven.

85
00:11:25,636 --> 00:11:26,967
I don't.

86
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,035
My mother used to play that.

87
00:11:33,343 --> 00:11:34,708
Really?

88
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,048
Don't I look like a man
who had a mother?

89
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,881
I guess I was condescending.

90
00:11:43,086 --> 00:11:44,144
You were.

91
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:47,983
I read Beethoven used to wear
his clothes till they came apart...

92
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:49,818
...and fell off his body.

93
00:11:50,027 --> 00:11:51,051
You can read.

94
00:11:51,728 --> 00:11:52,820
Another surprise.

95
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:56,056
Even write a word or two. Short ones.

96
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:57,631
A wit.

97
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:00,361
It's rare in these parts.

98
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,004
Rare as sassy women, I expect.

99
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:06,607
And I suppose you prefer your women
ignorant and docile.

100
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:09,502
Yes, ma'am.

101
00:12:12,616 --> 00:12:14,208
You're amusing enough, Mr?

102
00:12:14,418 --> 00:12:15,749
Rafe Covington, ma'am.

103
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:17,214
Ann Rodney.

104
00:12:21,858 --> 00:12:23,519
Mr. Covington?

105
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,088
Mrs. Rodney...

106
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,464
...your husband sent me here.

107
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:36,128
My husband has been dead
for more than a year.

108
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,610
You must be mistaken.

109
00:12:44,448 --> 00:12:45,881
I must be.

110
00:12:53,623 --> 00:12:55,420
Where can I get a drink?

111
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,093
Bruce Barkow's saloon, the National.

112
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,563
I'll pick up those supplies
in a day or two.

113
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:04,199
Thank you. Ma'am.

114
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:05,390
Sir.

115
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:09,037
Well...

116
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:11,503
...he sure is an interesting fellow.

117
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:14,170
He could use a bath.

118
00:13:21,818 --> 00:13:23,877
- What'll it be?
- What are my options?

119
00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:26,021
I got whiskey...

120
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:28,146
...whiskey and...

121
00:13:28,358 --> 00:13:29,347
Whiskey.

122
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,459
You catch on fast.

123
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,201
To Charles Rodney.

124
00:13:48,445 --> 00:13:49,878
May he rest in peace.

125
00:13:55,218 --> 00:13:56,310
Amen.

126
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:00,953
Yes, sir.

127
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:02,547
Good man.

128
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:14,226
Sheriff Moncrieff.

129
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,302
Also justice of the peace...

130
00:14:16,506 --> 00:14:20,272
...both of which are in short supply
in these parts.

131
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:22,574
Rafe Covington.

132
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:27,773
Obliged.

133
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:32,650
Haven't heard Rodney's name
spoken around here for some time.

134
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:33,845
Sad end.

135
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:36,318
Well, those Sioux raiding parties...

136
00:14:36,526 --> 00:14:38,824
...frequent that Wind River Trail.

137
00:14:39,863 --> 00:14:41,023
Did you catch them?

138
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:44,166
No, sir. Never even found
poor Charlie's body.

139
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:47,859
Bastards carried him off
like a bunch of crows.

140
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,769
I seen it all.

141
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,739
I'm sorry to hear that.

142
00:14:55,545 --> 00:14:56,876
Why?

143
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:05,186
Must have been upsetting for you.

144
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:26,101
Get up!

145
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,343
Go on, now!

146
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:40,519
You want the postman, the barber,
or the undertaker?

147
00:15:40,724 --> 00:15:42,089
Barber.

148
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,554
Should have figured.

149
00:15:44,761 --> 00:15:46,729
New face in town...

150
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,455
...ain't likely to
have mail just yet.

151
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,031
Well...

152
00:15:53,503 --> 00:15:54,970
...the barber...

153
00:15:56,473 --> 00:15:57,804
...is in.

154
00:15:58,008 --> 00:16:00,568
- Shave and a bath.
- Shave first.

155
00:16:00,777 --> 00:16:02,768
No sense getting blood...

156
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:05,174
...all over a clean body.

157
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:14,152
It ain't polite
to follow people around.

158
00:16:14,357 --> 00:16:16,723
- Joe.
- Wylie.

159
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,688
I'm Joe Gill.

160
00:16:25,702 --> 00:16:27,499
Suit yourself, young fella.

161
00:16:30,707 --> 00:16:34,040
I used to work for Charles Rodney.
He was a hell of a good man.

162
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,041
Yes, he was.

163
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,841
I wish I'd been with him
on that trip.

164
00:16:41,685 --> 00:16:44,654
Things just might have
turned out different.

165
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,386
Where was he going?

166
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:50,423
Wasn't going anywhere.

167
00:16:51,528 --> 00:16:53,826
He was coming back
from San Francisco.

168
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,292
Business.

169
00:17:48,018 --> 00:17:49,576
Excuse me.

170
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:54,548
That awful day on the Wind River Trail,
how big was that Sioux raiding party?

171
00:17:58,628 --> 00:18:00,220
I don't recall.

172
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,692
Five...

173
00:18:01,898 --> 00:18:03,525
...six maybe.

174
00:18:04,868 --> 00:18:06,267
What was Rodney wearing?

175
00:18:07,937 --> 00:18:09,199
What was he wearing?

176
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:12,535
You heard me.

177
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:16,270
What damn difference does that make?
That was a year ago.

178
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:19,414
No difference,
you being a liar and all.

179
00:18:22,585 --> 00:18:24,416
Say that again.

180
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,913
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

181
00:18:27,123 --> 00:18:30,490
No need for hostilities here.
We're all friends.

182
00:18:31,628 --> 00:18:33,425
Come on, Snake.

183
00:18:34,664 --> 00:18:35,961
Snake!

184
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,327
Go on. Get out of here.

185
00:18:45,175 --> 00:18:46,972
Sorry about that, Mr. Covington.

186
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,902
Why are you apologizing?

187
00:18:50,113 --> 00:18:53,708
Didn't want to give you the idea
this is an unfriendly town, I guess.

188
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:56,408
I'm Bruce Barkow.

189
00:18:58,521 --> 00:19:00,352
Well, I love a friendly town.

190
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:01,819
Believe I'm staying.

191
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:03,492
Good.

192
00:19:04,461 --> 00:19:05,951
That's good.

193
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:10,227
- This ain't over, boy.
- No, it's not.

194
00:19:19,776 --> 00:19:21,437
Can I ride along with you?

195
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:23,578
Do I have a choice?

196
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:28,748
You seem to be looking
for a lot of trouble, Mr. Covington.

197
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:30,647
Not particularly.

198
00:19:30,854 --> 00:19:32,116
Oh, yeah?

199
00:19:32,322 --> 00:19:35,416
Well, that fella you braced
back there in town?

200
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:37,353
Snake Corville.

201
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:39,588
And?

202
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:44,091
And I ain't never seen nobody
brace him and walk away from it.

203
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:51,930
Charles Rodney wasn't killed
by a Sioux raiding party.

204
00:19:55,211 --> 00:19:58,374
If the Indians didn't kill him,
Mr. Covington...

205
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:00,378
...how did he die?

206
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,314
Oh, that's how.

207
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:17,493
Whoa...

208
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:21,200
- Do you speak Sioux?
- How did you know?

209
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:24,202
It's a gift. Say something friendly.

210
00:21:03,046 --> 00:21:04,707
Easy. Easy. Easy.

211
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:14,484
It's gonna be all right.

212
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:16,886
It's all right.

213
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,462
Great heavens!

214
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:27,169
We better get out of here.

215
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:29,630
We'll set her leg. It's broke.

216
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,830
That ain't no run-of-the-mill
Indian girl.

217
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,272
That mark means she's the
chief's daughter and we better go.

218
00:21:36,613 --> 00:21:38,581
Cut some splints, Joe.

219
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:43,545
They catch us with her, they'll
skin us and make jerky out of us...

220
00:21:43,753 --> 00:21:46,722
...and hang us on
the nearest sycamore.

221
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,067
Easy.

222
00:22:26,562 --> 00:22:28,325
Well, thank you kindly.

223
00:22:28,531 --> 00:22:30,465
You rounded up our missing stray.

224
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:32,396
Rope her, brother Luke.

225
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,062
Excuse me.

226
00:22:36,506 --> 00:22:38,440
Get your own damn squaw.

227
00:22:38,641 --> 00:22:40,302
We cut her out for ourselves.

228
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,137
You want to take her...

229
00:22:42,645 --> 00:22:44,738
...you're welcome to try.

230
00:22:46,182 --> 00:22:50,881
But he'll have a tough time pulling on
that hog leg while it's still lashed.

231
00:22:53,256 --> 00:22:54,382
Luke...

232
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,652
...is my Colt lashed down?

233
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:01,722
Yep.

234
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:05,227
You still can't take down
the three of us.

235
00:23:05,535 --> 00:23:06,968
Maybe not.

236
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,064
Maybe so.

237
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:18,610
Enjoy my squaw, mister.

238
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,778
We'll meet again.

239
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:37,024
Well, you might turn
out to be useful.

240
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:38,928
Are you this way always?

241
00:23:39,135 --> 00:23:42,366
If you are, I want to end
this association.

242
00:23:42,572 --> 00:23:43,937
And why is that?

243
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,732
Well, hell, look at you.

244
00:23:45,942 --> 00:23:49,571
First day in the valley,
you rile every hard case in Wyoming.

245
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,876
To say nothing
about that war party over there.

246
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:12,594
Well, it's a gift.

247
00:24:13,236 --> 00:24:16,501
It's a wonder to me you lived
much past 10 years old.

248
00:24:21,611 --> 00:24:23,272
Squaw-napping. Now...

249
00:24:23,946 --> 00:24:26,437
...that's about as bad a thing
as you can do.

250
00:24:26,649 --> 00:24:29,015
And that old man in the lead...

251
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,708
...that's Red Cloud.

252
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,888
And it looks to me...

253
00:24:33,322 --> 00:24:35,790
...like he's got
a pretty good grouch on.

254
00:25:13,329 --> 00:25:16,526
What the hell is the right word
for leg?

255
00:25:27,043 --> 00:25:29,068
Tell him we're friends
of Charles Rodney.

256
00:25:30,813 --> 00:25:32,405
Rodney's dead.

257
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:35,977
I promised him
I'd keep his property safe.

258
00:25:52,902 --> 00:25:55,928
He said since you
helped his daughter...

259
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,698
...and you're
Charles Rodney's friend...

260
00:25:58,908 --> 00:26:00,341
...you may go.

261
00:26:00,843 --> 00:26:02,606
Much obliged.

262
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,747
Let's just ease on out of here.

263
00:26:26,435 --> 00:26:30,201
That true what you said
about looking after Charlie's ranch?

264
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,766
It is.

265
00:26:31,974 --> 00:26:36,070
Well, hell. That's the best news
I've heard in a year.

266
00:26:44,453 --> 00:26:45,886
Easy.

267
00:26:55,765 --> 00:26:58,598
How did you know he was
just gonna do that?

268
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:00,697
It's a gift.

269
00:27:02,605 --> 00:27:05,130
Guess today wasn't my day to die.

270
00:27:06,008 --> 00:27:06,997
Well, hell...

271
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,177
...the day ain't over yet.

272
00:27:20,189 --> 00:27:21,178
For you, Ann.

273
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,948
You know I can't accept it.

274
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:26,026
Of course you can.
Nothing's too good for my fiancée.

275
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,253
I wish you wouldn't use that word.

276
00:27:28,464 --> 00:27:30,762
I would love to replace it
with "wife."

277
00:27:32,635 --> 00:27:35,866
Ann, I'm a patient man,
but my heart's in a hurry.

278
00:27:37,206 --> 00:27:38,935
Charlie's gone, Ann.

279
00:27:39,141 --> 00:27:42,304
He was a good man and he loved you...

280
00:27:43,546 --> 00:27:45,343
...but that's the past.

281
00:27:45,548 --> 00:27:47,573
And you're my future?

282
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,078
If it pleases you.

283
00:27:51,053 --> 00:27:53,317
Excuse me, Mr. Barkow...

284
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:01,721
I told you not to disturb me.

285
00:28:02,131 --> 00:28:05,760
They had a run-in with Covington too.
- He took our property.

286
00:28:05,968 --> 00:28:09,802
I don't want to hear it or
know about it. Just take care of it.

287
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,915
Sorry, Ann.

288
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,018
Bruce...

289
00:28:26,255 --> 00:28:29,452
...I can't pay the mortgage again
this month.

290
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:31,989
There just aren't enough
schoolchildren.

291
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,898
Ann, there will be.

292
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:39,794
Some day...

293
00:28:40,002 --> 00:28:43,369
...this little town
is going to be a magnificent city.

294
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:45,901
And I'm going to run it.

295
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,842
And I want you there by my side.

296
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:53,171
I thought Charlie had
valuable property in San Francisco.

297
00:28:53,382 --> 00:28:55,077
So did I.

298
00:28:55,284 --> 00:28:57,718
I loaned him that
money in good faith.

299
00:28:58,421 --> 00:29:00,286
Foreclosure wouldn't be right.

300
00:29:04,927 --> 00:29:07,794
Maybe I should just let the ranch go.

301
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,931
Do you know a man
named Rafe Covington?

302
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:19,406
Yes.

303
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:21,399
Yes, I met him today.

304
00:29:22,078 --> 00:29:24,205
He said Charlie sent him.

305
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:33,621
IKind of a hell of a mess around here,
but it used to be neat and tidy.

306
00:29:37,493 --> 00:29:38,585
Look here.

307
00:29:38,794 --> 00:29:41,627
This kid's killed this critter twice.

308
00:29:42,832 --> 00:29:45,528
You want it rare,
there's a bunch of them outside.

309
00:29:45,735 --> 00:29:49,899
Why don't you go take a bite of one?
- Mind your elders, boy.

310
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,698
You know, I've been around this place
a long time.

311
00:29:55,611 --> 00:29:59,513
I was here till Barkow
moved Mrs. Rodney to town...

312
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,478
...and then he run me off.

313
00:30:01,684 --> 00:30:02,981
Why does she listen to him?

314
00:30:03,486 --> 00:30:05,317
She's alone, she's scared.

315
00:30:05,521 --> 00:30:08,115
He's got manners and smells nice.

316
00:30:08,324 --> 00:30:11,987
Besides that, he wants this ranch
and he wants it something fierce.

317
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:13,953
Why does he want this place?

318
00:30:14,196 --> 00:30:15,060
I don't know.

319
00:30:15,264 --> 00:30:18,062
- Maybe he wants Mrs. Rodney fierce.
- Maybe.

320
00:30:18,267 --> 00:30:19,666
Maybe both.

321
00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:25,129
Is it Christmas yet?

322
00:30:30,513 --> 00:30:32,003
You don't look rich.

323
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,078
Maybe rich stopped mattering.

324
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,145
Maybe Charlie mattered more.

325
00:30:42,391 --> 00:30:44,655
Maybe this gourmet cooking
appealed to me.

326
00:30:47,496 --> 00:30:48,656
Brendan Mullaney.

327
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:52,533
"Rock" to me mates.

328
00:30:52,735 --> 00:30:55,135
- Joe Gill.
- Pleased to meet you, Joe.

329
00:30:55,371 --> 00:30:58,499
Welcome here to Crazy Woman Ranch.

330
00:31:28,404 --> 00:31:30,338
Come on, my boys.

331
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:34,899
Come on, boys.

332
00:32:28,898 --> 00:32:30,866
Look at them go!

333
00:33:19,515 --> 00:33:21,073
Stay with him!

334
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,357
Oh, boy.

335
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,239
Better slow down, young fella.

336
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:52,004
What difference does it make?

337
00:33:52,214 --> 00:33:53,476
Well...

338
00:33:54,183 --> 00:33:56,208
...see, if you take your time...

339
00:33:56,418 --> 00:34:00,354
...you get a more harmonious outcome.
Here, let me show you something.

340
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:08,722
All you need to do, and you don't
need to kill yourself doing it...

341
00:34:10,432 --> 00:34:12,662
...is take a couple of licks
this way...

342
00:34:13,402 --> 00:34:15,029
...a couple that way...

343
00:34:15,237 --> 00:34:16,932
...across the heel.

344
00:34:17,206 --> 00:34:19,381
Pretty much got it.

345
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:21,338
I'm gonna pick up those supplies.

346
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:23,777
I should do that, Rafe.

347
00:34:25,114 --> 00:34:27,480
No. I'll go.

348
00:34:33,522 --> 00:34:34,887
He'll go.

349
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,767
You're full of surprises,
Mr. Covington.

350
00:34:54,977 --> 00:34:56,467
Mrs. Rodney.

351
00:34:56,712 --> 00:34:58,373
- Here...
- No, I'll get it.

352
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,180
Spend a lot of time in church?

353
00:35:09,391 --> 00:35:11,916
Well, it's a good place to think.

354
00:35:12,227 --> 00:35:14,661
Care to tell me
what you're thinking about?

355
00:35:24,907 --> 00:35:26,238
Ma'am?

356
00:35:27,242 --> 00:35:28,709
Excuse me.

357
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:34,273
Your husband wasn't killed
a year ago.

358
00:35:34,483 --> 00:35:35,711
- No.
- No, ma'am.

359
00:35:35,918 --> 00:35:38,011
He died in my arms six weeks ago.

360
00:35:39,922 --> 00:35:41,617
Morning, Mr. Covington.

361
00:35:43,525 --> 00:35:44,514
Mr. Barkow.

362
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,091
Ann...

363
00:35:46,929 --> 00:35:48,419
...ready for our ride?

364
00:35:50,766 --> 00:35:52,461
Have I interrupted something?

365
00:35:54,336 --> 00:35:55,496
No, Bruce.

366
00:35:55,704 --> 00:35:57,672
Mr. Covington was just leaving.

367
00:35:59,108 --> 00:36:00,473
Yes, ma'am.

368
00:36:09,284 --> 00:36:10,649
I'll be at the ranch.

369
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,678
What ranch would that be?

370
00:36:14,523 --> 00:36:16,388
Rodney place.

371
00:36:20,629 --> 00:36:22,688
You're letting him
stay at your ranch?

372
00:36:22,898 --> 00:36:24,456
Certainly not.

373
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:27,362
Then he's trespassing.
We'll get Sheriff Moncrieff.

374
00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:28,900
Bruce...

375
00:36:29,371 --> 00:36:33,398
...he said that Charlie died six
weeks ago. Why would he say that?

376
00:36:33,742 --> 00:36:35,801
He wants something from you.

377
00:36:36,245 --> 00:36:38,338
With a ranch like yours...

378
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,979
...most men would shake hands
with the devil. Come on.

379
00:36:47,856 --> 00:36:49,414
Come on, girl.

380
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:50,649
Come on!

381
00:37:01,436 --> 00:37:04,337
That won't wash off in the rain.

382
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,030
Let him up boys, let him up.

383
00:37:06,241 --> 00:37:07,401
Go on, little fella.

384
00:37:28,397 --> 00:37:31,560
Ain't it a beautiful part
of the world, Mr. Covington?

385
00:37:33,101 --> 00:37:34,898
I'm glad you're here.

386
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:37,062
And for me...

387
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:39,302
...hell, it's good to be home.

388
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:41,908
You bet.

389
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:07,860
Old Hennesey's dying
of the tuberculosis...

390
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:11,665
...so his missis sends for the priest
to give him the last rites.

391
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,467
The priest arrives
at the deathbed and says:

392
00:38:14,676 --> 00:38:16,576
"Hennesey, do you renounce Satan?"

393
00:38:16,778 --> 00:38:19,269
"No," says Hennesey, "I do not."

394
00:38:19,481 --> 00:38:21,608
"You do not?" says the priest.

395
00:38:21,817 --> 00:38:23,307
"No," says Hennesey.

396
00:38:23,518 --> 00:38:26,976
"A man in my condition can't afford
to make any enemies."

397
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:35,795
Well, we've made a few.

398
00:38:35,998 --> 00:38:38,899
Won't be long they'll be trying
to run us out of here.

399
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,941
If I couldn't hear you breathing...

400
00:38:54,149 --> 00:38:57,016
...I would have thought
that you had expired.

401
00:39:10,899 --> 00:39:14,357
This waiting is
affecting my strategy.

402
00:39:15,237 --> 00:39:19,298
Well, I hope that strategy
don't include plans for that queen...

403
00:39:19,508 --> 00:39:21,203
...because she's gone.

404
00:39:24,379 --> 00:39:25,573
No more Irish jokes.

405
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:27,510
No, I like them.

406
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:30,544
There are two bulls
at the top of a hill...

407
00:39:30,752 --> 00:39:32,014
...in Cornamona.

408
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,188
The young bull says
to the old bull...

409
00:39:34,389 --> 00:39:36,357
Would it help
to give back your queen?

410
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:00,672
That's a boy.

411
00:40:27,075 --> 00:40:28,633
Mrs. Rodney.

412
00:40:30,278 --> 00:40:31,575
Hello, Joe.

413
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:37,245
Seeing you here
brings back good memories.

414
00:40:37,486 --> 00:40:39,181
For me, as well.

415
00:40:39,388 --> 00:40:42,118
I thought the place
would have been more rundown.

416
00:40:42,324 --> 00:40:43,484
It was.

417
00:40:44,793 --> 00:40:45,987
Howdy, ma'am.

418
00:40:46,561 --> 00:40:47,858
John Thomas Langston.

419
00:40:48,063 --> 00:40:49,052
Mr. Langston.

420
00:40:49,264 --> 00:40:50,959
Nice to see you.

421
00:40:51,733 --> 00:40:53,257
Rock Mullaney.

422
00:40:53,502 --> 00:40:55,197
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

423
00:40:57,272 --> 00:40:58,933
Will you excuse us, gentlemen?

424
00:41:03,912 --> 00:41:05,436
Go on, pup.

425
00:41:06,615 --> 00:41:08,480
Cut a trail. Go on.

426
00:41:13,121 --> 00:41:14,452
Mr. Covington...

427
00:41:14,656 --> 00:41:17,489
...when my husband died,
I turned my back on this ranch...

428
00:41:17,692 --> 00:41:19,660
...and haven't set foot since.

429
00:41:20,295 --> 00:41:22,229
It wasn't easy for me to come out.

430
00:41:22,431 --> 00:41:24,194
I appreciate that.

431
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,867
But what you said disturbed me.

432
00:41:27,102 --> 00:41:28,433
Who are you?

433
00:41:29,037 --> 00:41:30,629
And why are you doing this?

434
00:41:33,642 --> 00:41:35,166
Mrs. Rodney...

435
00:41:36,311 --> 00:41:38,779
...your late husband was my friend.

436
00:41:44,286 --> 00:41:46,550
I'm keeping half my promise to him.

437
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:48,552
What do you mean by "half"?

438
00:41:49,124 --> 00:41:51,115
I gave Charlie my word...

439
00:41:51,326 --> 00:41:53,692
...l'd look after this place...

440
00:41:55,664 --> 00:41:57,256
And you.

441
00:42:00,702 --> 00:42:02,101
My husband...

442
00:42:02,304 --> 00:42:04,204
...asked you to look after me?

443
00:42:07,209 --> 00:42:08,608
Yes, ma'am.

444
00:42:11,179 --> 00:42:14,171
My husband never mentioned you to me,
Mr. Covington.

445
00:42:14,382 --> 00:42:15,644
I don't believe you.

446
00:42:15,851 --> 00:42:16,840
I can't.

447
00:42:24,493 --> 00:42:25,983
Oh, well.

448
00:43:06,201 --> 00:43:08,533
I met Charlie in San Francisco.

449
00:43:10,138 --> 00:43:12,629
My father was stationed there
in the Navy.

450
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:15,335
Charlie was a businessman.

451
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:17,441
Real estate and shipping.

452
00:43:19,414 --> 00:43:21,348
This was his dream.

453
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:25,809
I came along because I loved him.

454
00:43:30,592 --> 00:43:33,060
It was gonna be such an adventure.

455
00:43:36,565 --> 00:43:39,261
And our daughter died at 4 months.

456
00:43:40,268 --> 00:43:41,758
Cholera.

457
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:45,966
And then Charlie...

458
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,007
It tamed me right down.

459
00:44:04,926 --> 00:44:06,689
I shouldn't have come out here.

460
00:44:07,095 --> 00:44:09,086
- I don't belong here.
- Don't you?

461
00:44:09,698 --> 00:44:10,722
No.

462
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,127
Charlie loved this ranch.

463
00:44:17,372 --> 00:44:20,500
He talked about it all the time.

464
00:44:21,843 --> 00:44:24,175
But I believe what he loved most...

465
00:44:25,113 --> 00:44:26,512
...was you.

466
00:44:38,059 --> 00:44:40,619
Enjoy your stay here, Mr. Covington.

467
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:42,222
It'll be short.

468
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,676
- Afternoon, gentlemen.
- Peewee.

469
00:45:05,687 --> 00:45:08,850
- What'll it be?
- Whiskey with a whiskey chaser.

470
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,885
Yours is on the house, Mr. Covington.

471
00:45:14,095 --> 00:45:15,824
Two bits apiece for the rest.

472
00:45:16,031 --> 00:45:17,555
Why is his on the house?

473
00:45:17,766 --> 00:45:22,032
I always stand a man his last round.
- We just got here, lad.

474
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:25,403
Taggart says he'll kill him
next time he sees him.

475
00:45:25,707 --> 00:45:27,004
Figured that.

476
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:29,108
If Taggart comes in...

477
00:45:30,011 --> 00:45:31,876
...might want to buy him a drink.

478
00:45:34,616 --> 00:45:36,174
Another wee dram.

479
00:45:36,384 --> 00:45:40,286
You got a problem where I hang my hat,
don't send a woman with the message.

480
00:45:41,923 --> 00:45:43,413
I won't.

481
00:45:44,526 --> 00:45:47,689
Any message you get from me
will be crystal clear.

482
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:51,090
Stay away from Ann Rodney.

483
00:45:56,638 --> 00:45:58,503
Whoa, slow down there.

484
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:00,869
Take your time.

485
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,739
You'll get a more harmonious outcome.

486
00:46:07,949 --> 00:46:11,749
God invented the whiskey to keep
the Irish from ruling the world.

487
00:46:13,955 --> 00:46:15,388
You're very persistent.

488
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:17,490
Mrs. Rodney, hear me out.

489
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,922
Then if you want me to, I'll go.

490
00:46:29,237 --> 00:46:32,729
I met your husband on a freighter
out of San Francisco.

491
00:46:32,941 --> 00:46:35,637
I was working down the Coast.
He was shanghaied.

492
00:46:35,844 --> 00:46:39,109
He told me he sold off
his holdings in San Francisco...

493
00:46:39,314 --> 00:46:41,305
...to pay off the mortgage
on your ranch.

494
00:46:41,516 --> 00:46:46,453
So he celebrated, got drunk, got
robbed and ended up aboard our ship...

495
00:46:49,424 --> 00:46:52,450
When he tried to escape,
the captain beat him to death.

496
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,493
That was six weeks ago.

497
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:00,264
Do you have any proof of this?

498
00:47:01,536 --> 00:47:03,197
Just my word.

499
00:47:07,308 --> 00:47:09,208
Pardon the intrusion, ma'am.

500
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,843
Mr. Covington?

501
00:47:24,659 --> 00:47:26,286
Just let me think.

502
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:31,955
Thank you, ma'am.

503
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:40,370
Mike Taggart's calling you out.

504
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:44,840
Covington!

505
00:47:46,414 --> 00:47:47,813
I want you.

506
00:47:48,049 --> 00:47:50,711
And my gun ain't lashed down now.

507
00:47:55,723 --> 00:47:57,554
Mr. Thompson...

508
00:47:58,326 --> 00:48:00,886
...did Charles Rodney order that '76?

509
00:48:01,095 --> 00:48:02,619
Yes, sir. He did.

510
00:48:03,031 --> 00:48:04,589
How's my credit?

511
00:48:09,237 --> 00:48:11,000
Covington!

512
00:48:22,784 --> 00:48:24,012
Come on.

513
00:48:36,197 --> 00:48:37,687
Where you going, Covington?

514
00:48:44,472 --> 00:48:47,032
I'm gonna blow you
out of them fancy boots.

515
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:58,046
Now calm down, Taggart, and you'll
get a more harmonious outcome.

516
00:48:58,253 --> 00:49:00,221
Besides, you really
ought to thank me.

517
00:49:00,421 --> 00:49:02,412
Thank you? For what?

518
00:49:02,624 --> 00:49:04,751
The fact that
you're wearing your hair.

519
00:49:04,959 --> 00:49:07,325
That was Red Cloud's daughter
you poached.

520
00:49:08,663 --> 00:49:10,597
I don't know what
you're talking about.

521
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:15,201
Then we've got no quarrel, have we?

522
00:50:31,479 --> 00:50:34,346
- Bastard killed my brother.
- He'll do the same to you.

523
00:50:37,452 --> 00:50:38,646
Go to IKansas...

524
00:50:38,853 --> 00:50:40,582
...find Bo Dorn.

525
00:50:40,888 --> 00:50:41,877
Bring him back.

526
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:43,886
Bo Dorn don't like being brought.

527
00:50:44,092 --> 00:50:45,559
He likes being paid.

528
00:50:48,529 --> 00:50:50,224
That was some shooting!

529
00:50:50,898 --> 00:50:52,331
Wasn't shooting.

530
00:50:52,934 --> 00:50:54,561
That was killing.

531
00:51:11,352 --> 00:51:12,785
Thank you, Lee.

532
00:51:21,095 --> 00:51:22,995
It's overcooked, stupid.

533
00:51:23,197 --> 00:51:26,132
- I'm sorry, Mr. Barkow.
- Cook it again.

534
00:51:27,568 --> 00:51:30,002
Cook it again! Now.

535
00:51:33,574 --> 00:51:36,042
Well, why did Taggart
confront Mr. Covington?

536
00:51:36,577 --> 00:51:38,204
It's not delicate.

537
00:51:38,546 --> 00:51:40,275
Neither am I.

538
00:51:41,749 --> 00:51:43,273
Shortly after he arrived...

539
00:51:43,484 --> 00:51:46,453
...Rafe Covington
attempted to rape a squaw.

540
00:51:47,422 --> 00:51:50,858
Taggart caught him and freed
the squaw, but Covington got away.

541
00:51:51,059 --> 00:51:54,085
And naturally, being a man
of impeccable character...

542
00:51:54,295 --> 00:51:56,422
...Taggart felt it necessary...

543
00:51:56,631 --> 00:51:58,622
...to avenge the squaw's honor?

544
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:01,358
Something like that.
Thank you, Peewee.

545
00:52:01,569 --> 00:52:04,834
- It looks marvelous.
- Special for you, Miss Ann.

546
00:52:07,075 --> 00:52:08,064
Bruce...

547
00:52:08,276 --> 00:52:10,836
...he said Charlie
died aboard a ship.

548
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:14,879
He sold his San Francisco holdings
to pay off the mortgage on the ranch.

549
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:17,551
But he was robbed and shanghaied.

550
00:52:17,752 --> 00:52:21,586
Perhaps he wants to acquire
a lovely ranch...

551
00:52:21,789 --> 00:52:23,814
...and the lovely lady
that goes with it.

552
00:52:24,325 --> 00:52:26,122
- Isn't that what you want?
- Ann...

553
00:52:26,627 --> 00:52:28,117
...I love you.

554
00:52:28,329 --> 00:52:29,819
There were no holdings.

555
00:52:30,031 --> 00:52:32,158
No one was shanghaied.

556
00:52:32,366 --> 00:52:34,891
Charlie died on the trail home.

557
00:52:37,705 --> 00:52:41,903
The prime requisite of charlatans
is their ability to fake sincerity.

558
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,679
One, two, three, lads!

559
00:52:50,485 --> 00:52:52,180
Go on up there.

560
00:52:52,386 --> 00:52:53,614
You're a dirty beast.

561
00:52:53,821 --> 00:52:58,155
Maybe the dumb bastard thought it was
water and wanted to have a bath.

562
00:52:59,393 --> 00:53:01,725
This isn't the only
fine creature here...

563
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:04,227
...that should be wanting a bath.

564
00:53:04,799 --> 00:53:06,323
You can say that again.

565
00:53:06,534 --> 00:53:08,627
Come on, mate. That's it.
That's the boy.

566
00:53:08,836 --> 00:53:12,465
That's the boy. Now we have it.
Let him go, Joe. Let him go.

567
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:15,208
There you go. Go on, boy.

568
00:53:18,479 --> 00:53:20,344
What in the hell is that stuff?

569
00:53:20,681 --> 00:53:21,841
The boys here...

570
00:53:22,049 --> 00:53:23,949
...are covered in petroleum.

571
00:53:24,152 --> 00:53:25,380
What's "tapoleum"?

572
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:27,618
It's oil.

573
00:53:27,822 --> 00:53:31,155
You make kerosene out of it and
asphalt for paving the streets.

574
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:32,553
Is it worth anything?

575
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,251
Worth more than enough
to pay off a mortgage.

576
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:47,501
Howdy, gents.

577
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:49,039
Hello, Walter.

578
00:53:49,343 --> 00:53:50,571
Sheriff...

579
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:53,780
...you're sitting
in my rocking chair.

580
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,574
I thought that's what it was for.

581
00:53:57,885 --> 00:54:00,080
It's for people I
invite to sit in it.

582
00:54:00,388 --> 00:54:02,754
Walter, you ain't invited.

583
00:54:13,067 --> 00:54:15,092
I want your version
of them shootings.

584
00:54:15,736 --> 00:54:16,862
Self-defense.

585
00:54:17,071 --> 00:54:18,197
- That's it?
- Yes, sir.

586
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:22,541
Well, there's some folks around here
says different.

587
00:54:23,144 --> 00:54:24,736
They're not being truthful.

588
00:54:24,946 --> 00:54:26,573
You son of a bitch.

589
00:54:28,749 --> 00:54:33,152
I'm sorry about your brother, but I
gave him every chance to walk away.

590
00:54:33,487 --> 00:54:36,422
- Are you going to arrest him or not?
- Not today, Luke.

591
00:54:37,225 --> 00:54:39,090
Well, what else you come for?

592
00:54:39,293 --> 00:54:43,423
You are trespassing illegally
on this property.

593
00:54:44,632 --> 00:54:46,099
You can leave freely...

594
00:54:46,467 --> 00:54:48,025
...or in irons.

595
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:49,597
It's your choice.

596
00:54:50,905 --> 00:54:54,068
Ann Rodney owns this spread.
I'll get off it when she says.

597
00:54:55,076 --> 00:54:57,408
Well, I'm the mortgage holder...

598
00:54:57,745 --> 00:55:01,146
...and I'm telling you,
you have three days to clear out.

599
00:55:01,682 --> 00:55:05,345
It appears you already got
that mortgage money, Barkow.

600
00:55:08,422 --> 00:55:09,582
Prove it.

601
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:13,853
Believe I will.

602
00:55:14,095 --> 00:55:15,892
Sheriff Moncrieff.

603
00:55:19,033 --> 00:55:20,728
There is a rather large...

604
00:55:20,935 --> 00:55:24,701
...outstanding balance on this,
Mr. Covington.

605
00:55:26,874 --> 00:55:29,035
Three days, Mr. Covington.

606
00:55:34,815 --> 00:55:36,806
<i>You had no right to do that.</i>

607
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:40,380
Did you put flowers
on Taralee's grave?

608
00:55:43,624 --> 00:55:44,613
No.

609
00:55:44,825 --> 00:55:46,156
He did.

610
00:55:46,861 --> 00:55:50,297
Have I not devoted myself to
protecting you and your interests?

611
00:55:50,531 --> 00:55:51,828
Yes.

612
00:55:52,133 --> 00:55:53,964
Been at your beck and call?

613
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:00,403
Yes.

614
00:56:01,375 --> 00:56:03,843
Come over
in the middle of the night...

615
00:56:04,045 --> 00:56:06,411
...to chase away
nightmares and spiders?

616
00:56:07,148 --> 00:56:08,740
It was a very big spider.

617
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:11,484
Could have put a saddle on it.

618
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:19,649
In three days...

619
00:56:20,027 --> 00:56:22,928
...if Rafe Covington has
not vacated Crazy Woman...

620
00:56:23,531 --> 00:56:25,294
...I will kick him off.

621
00:56:26,334 --> 00:56:28,598
By whatever means necessary.

622
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:30,800
One question, Bruce.

623
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:33,272
Is the ranch still mine?

624
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:35,938
Of course.

625
00:56:37,278 --> 00:56:39,542
Then I'll decide
who's welcome to stay.

626
00:56:53,794 --> 00:56:55,557
Why you shoot that old Evans, Joe?

627
00:56:56,797 --> 00:56:59,459
Well, it's got 28 bullets...

628
00:57:00,301 --> 00:57:02,462
...and I ain't a very good shot.

629
00:57:04,271 --> 00:57:05,863
I'm going to town.

630
00:57:14,882 --> 00:57:15,974
Nellie.

631
00:57:31,966 --> 00:57:34,594
Apparently right and wrong
mean nothing to you.

632
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:37,701
Mr. Gill...

633
00:57:37,905 --> 00:57:40,271
...once Covington leaves the ranch...

634
00:57:41,308 --> 00:57:42,741
...you're welcome to stay on.

635
00:57:47,248 --> 00:57:48,579
No, sir.

636
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:52,111
Your talk is as cheap as your liquor.

637
00:58:46,807 --> 00:58:47,967
What'll it be?

638
00:58:48,175 --> 00:58:50,541
I got whiskey, whiskey and...

639
00:58:57,885 --> 00:58:59,147
That'll be one dollar.

640
00:59:01,689 --> 00:59:02,678
Sir?

641
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:05,757
One time he killed three fellas,
cut their heads off.

642
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:09,020
Hung them above the pawnshop,
right by a sign that said:

643
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:11,323
"Money to loan."

644
00:59:11,866 --> 00:59:14,926
Then he's having supper
with a guy one time...

645
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:18,761
...chased him down the end
of main street...

646
00:59:19,573 --> 00:59:22,736
...killed him, skinned him,
nailed his hide to the barn door.

647
00:59:22,943 --> 00:59:27,107
He's tougher than the back wall of a
shooting gallery. And that, boys...

648
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:28,372
...is Bo Dorn.

649
00:59:29,617 --> 00:59:31,244
Sounds like one scary fella.

650
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:33,018
Does, doesn't he?

651
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:34,812
Maybe he's passing through.

652
00:59:35,022 --> 00:59:39,425
Nope. He don't leave IKansas unless
he's on his way to kill somebody.

653
00:59:39,627 --> 00:59:41,959
I'm betting that somebody
is you, boss.

654
00:59:42,696 --> 00:59:43,754
No bet.

655
00:59:43,964 --> 00:59:47,024
So you're gonna go to town
and face this Bo Dorn fella...

656
00:59:47,234 --> 00:59:49,259
...just to keep a promise to Charlie.

657
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:52,906
Come on now, Joe. There's more
to this than real estate.

658
00:59:55,309 --> 00:59:57,174
What are you laughing at?

659
00:59:57,778 --> 00:59:59,871
I'm just reading the signs, Rafe.

660
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,775
And the tracks is fresh.

661
01:00:03,584 --> 01:00:06,246
About 115 pounds.
Answers to the name of "Ann."

662
01:00:10,157 --> 01:00:12,057
She plays a nice piano.

663
01:00:39,753 --> 01:00:42,313
<i>"Above them all, the Archangel</i>

664
01:00:42,523 --> 01:00:45,151
<i>But his face deep scars of thunder...</i>

665
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:46,621
...had entrenched

666
01:00:46,827 --> 01:00:49,227
And care sat on his faded cheeks

667
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:52,092
But under brows of dauntless courage

668
01:00:52,299 --> 01:00:55,735
And considerate pride waiting revenge

669
01:00:55,936 --> 01:00:57,130
Cruel his eye...

670
01:00:57,338 --> 01:01:02,241
...but cast signs of remorse
and passion to behold..."

671
01:01:05,145 --> 01:01:09,980
"I feel a link of nature draw me; flesh
of flesh, bone of my bone thou art

672
01:01:10,184 --> 01:01:14,052
And from thy state of mind shall
never be parted in bliss or woe."

673
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:20,055
I always liked poetry,
never could understand it.

674
01:01:20,461 --> 01:01:21,792
Really?

675
01:01:24,665 --> 01:01:26,599
I was hoping you could help.

676
01:01:28,736 --> 01:01:31,603
Well, seeing as though
it's such a beautiful day...

677
01:01:31,805 --> 01:01:34,103
...why don't we all go play outside?

678
01:01:44,518 --> 01:01:46,748
The last time I saw you...

679
01:01:47,087 --> 01:01:48,884
...you were busy killing men.

680
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:54,521
And all to honor your word
to my dead husband.

681
01:01:56,764 --> 01:01:59,130
You were part of the promise.

682
01:02:04,038 --> 01:02:05,733
Yes, I was.

683
01:02:11,912 --> 01:02:12,970
Rafe.

684
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:16,305
What sort of a name is that?

685
01:02:17,184 --> 01:02:19,379
Short for Raphael.

686
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,410
The Archangel.

687
01:02:21,622 --> 01:02:24,557
Sent by Providence
to guide and to guard...

688
01:02:24,758 --> 01:02:26,749
...to heal and to save.

689
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,518
That Raphael?

690
01:02:31,899 --> 01:02:34,060
My mother was a God-fearing woman.

691
01:02:34,535 --> 01:02:36,901
And she taught you
Beethoven and Milton.

692
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:39,567
After a fashion.

693
01:02:40,174 --> 01:02:42,938
She sent me to the Jesuits.

694
01:02:44,411 --> 01:02:45,708
To be a priest?

695
01:02:45,913 --> 01:02:47,141
Yes, ma'am.

696
01:02:49,616 --> 01:02:51,914
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

697
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:55,920
Tell me, how does a man
go from the Jesuits to...

698
01:03:00,027 --> 01:03:02,825
Couldn't get the knack
of turning the other cheek.

699
01:03:10,437 --> 01:03:14,168
Every time you finish talking
you get on your horse and ride away.

700
01:03:14,508 --> 01:03:15,907
Why is that?

701
01:03:17,244 --> 01:03:20,441
Well, that's
an interesting question...

702
01:03:20,647 --> 01:03:24,208
...considering you've tried to get
rid of me ever since I hit town.

703
01:03:24,418 --> 01:03:26,818
Well, maybe I've changed my mind.

704
01:03:27,254 --> 01:03:29,313
That would be nice.

705
01:03:29,757 --> 01:03:31,349
I don't want to lose my ranch.

706
01:03:31,792 --> 01:03:32,850
You won't.

707
01:03:33,827 --> 01:03:37,729
I appreciate your respect for my
husband's memory, Mr. Covington.

708
01:03:38,232 --> 01:03:39,995
And your promise to him.

709
01:03:40,367 --> 01:03:42,665
It's a promise I'm planning to keep.

710
01:03:57,718 --> 01:03:59,276
Afternoon, Mr. Dorn.

711
01:04:03,123 --> 01:04:05,853
Would you mind stepping outside
to smoke that?

712
01:04:06,093 --> 01:04:08,152
I can't abide the devil weed.

713
01:04:13,734 --> 01:04:15,395
I'll be out here.

714
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:18,831
Let's get down to business, Barkow.

715
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:24,134
That 500 I already sent you...

716
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:26,241
...that's just a down payment.

717
01:04:26,847 --> 01:04:29,179
There will be 500 more
once Covington's gone.

718
01:04:29,383 --> 01:04:32,511
For that amount of money,
I wouldn't waste time nor lead.

719
01:04:34,288 --> 01:04:36,017
So how much do you want?

720
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:38,515
I've been looking to relocate.

721
01:04:38,859 --> 01:04:43,796
IKansas is a tad too civilized
to suit me. Now, the Rodney spread...

722
01:04:43,997 --> 01:04:45,692
...it might suit me just right.

723
01:04:47,734 --> 01:04:51,932
- I've been working on it over a year.
- Scheming and tripping over your spurs?

724
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:55,040
You should have let me
just shoot Charlie and be done...

725
01:04:55,242 --> 01:04:57,176
...but that was too easy.

726
01:04:57,377 --> 01:04:59,106
"Let the sea take him."

727
01:05:01,181 --> 01:05:03,240
That suited your fine hand
a bit better.

728
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:06,647
It was a good plan.
I just didn't figure on Covington.

729
01:05:07,187 --> 01:05:11,749
What kind of dinosaur upends his whole
life to keep a promise to a dead man?

730
01:05:11,959 --> 01:05:13,859
Well, it don't matter.

731
01:05:14,094 --> 01:05:18,428
You want that dinosaur extinct, we're
equal partners. Take it or leave it.

732
01:05:31,712 --> 01:05:33,839
It ain't all that bad.

733
01:05:34,281 --> 01:05:38,240
I could kill you and keep the bitch
and her patch of dirt all to myself.

734
01:05:57,704 --> 01:05:59,069
Good evening, Ann.

735
01:06:03,944 --> 01:06:05,377
It's late for a visit.

736
01:06:05,579 --> 01:06:07,240
Just in time, actually.

737
01:06:09,516 --> 01:06:11,814
The white satin dress, I think.

738
01:06:13,921 --> 01:06:15,115
The one I bought you.

739
01:06:15,489 --> 01:06:16,649
What about it?

740
01:06:17,925 --> 01:06:20,519
I'd like you to wear it tomorrow.

741
01:06:23,163 --> 01:06:24,528
To our wedding.

742
01:06:26,934 --> 01:06:29,926
Did I miss something,
or did another Ann agree to that?

743
01:06:30,137 --> 01:06:33,538
You want me on bended knee, Ann?
Okay. Here I am.

744
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,537
Marry me, Ann.

745
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:37,266
Bruce, please get up.

746
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:38,938
What's come over you?

747
01:06:39,146 --> 01:06:40,374
Love.

748
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:43,276
And love demands an answer.

749
01:06:44,718 --> 01:06:46,049
I'm not ready.

750
01:06:47,721 --> 01:06:49,518
You better damn well...

751
01:06:49,723 --> 01:06:51,247
...get ready.

752
01:06:51,692 --> 01:06:53,023
Or what?

753
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:56,187
Or...

754
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:02,568
Just do as I say.

755
01:07:29,696 --> 01:07:31,721
You know, I was
run off this place once.

756
01:07:34,067 --> 01:07:35,398
No more.

757
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:37,835
I'm staying.

758
01:07:39,306 --> 01:07:40,568
I'm with you, Rafe.

759
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:51,344
If it wasn't for Charlie on that boat,
I would have thrown myself overboard.

760
01:07:51,551 --> 01:07:53,246
He kept fighting...

761
01:07:53,787 --> 01:07:55,379
...no matter what.

762
01:07:56,757 --> 01:07:58,088
He never gave up.

763
01:08:01,328 --> 01:08:02,852
Neither will I.

764
01:08:08,101 --> 01:08:11,730
My whole life I've never had roots
deeper than topsoil.

765
01:08:16,576 --> 01:08:18,510
I believe I'm staying.

766
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:21,203
What are you gonna do?

767
01:08:21,548 --> 01:08:24,244
Take him down? Flush him out?

768
01:08:28,755 --> 01:08:31,155
Either way, your problem's solved.

769
01:08:35,595 --> 01:08:36,584
Breakfast, Ann?

770
01:08:36,797 --> 01:08:38,662
That would be lovely, Gene.

771
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:08,455
Push the rest of the strays
into the west canyon...

772
01:09:08,662 --> 01:09:10,527
...no later than noon.

773
01:09:31,485 --> 01:09:33,385
You won't like it there.

774
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:18,992
You boys won't make much fun of these
when I serve them up.

775
01:10:29,442 --> 01:10:31,103
All right, find your mom.
Go on.

776
01:11:17,891 --> 01:11:19,688
Don't look like much...

777
01:11:20,327 --> 01:11:22,124
...but it's damn near priceless.

778
01:11:22,329 --> 01:11:23,489
That's oil, ma'am.

779
01:11:38,812 --> 01:11:40,939
Is this what Bruce is after?

780
01:11:42,582 --> 01:11:43,810
One of the things.

781
01:11:44,751 --> 01:11:46,343
And what are you after?

782
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:49,817
One of the things.

783
01:11:57,430 --> 01:11:59,125
Are you after the oil?

784
01:12:00,567 --> 01:12:01,864
No, ma'am.

785
01:12:10,577 --> 01:12:12,442
Head for home, boys.

786
01:12:12,646 --> 01:12:13,635
That's a boys.

787
01:12:35,635 --> 01:12:37,398
Bruce has hired a killer.

788
01:12:37,771 --> 01:12:39,033
A man named Bo Dorn.

789
01:12:39,239 --> 01:12:41,104
He had to hire somebody.

790
01:12:41,308 --> 01:12:43,401
- You know Dorn?
- IKnow of.

791
01:12:44,511 --> 01:12:46,138
- Can he...?
- IKill me?

792
01:12:46,346 --> 01:12:47,506
Yes.

793
01:12:49,316 --> 01:12:50,749
Do you care?

794
01:12:51,084 --> 01:12:52,847
You know I do.

795
01:12:53,787 --> 01:12:55,812
Well, maybe you should say it.

796
01:12:57,324 --> 01:12:59,554
Well, maybe I should show it.

797
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:19,176
Can he?

798
01:13:20,914 --> 01:13:22,779
Nobody ever has.

799
01:13:53,913 --> 01:13:55,073
Go.

800
01:13:55,882 --> 01:13:57,042
Please.

801
01:14:54,174 --> 01:14:55,471
Aw, kid.

802
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:24,835
No!

803
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:51,990
It's starting.

804
01:15:52,198 --> 01:15:53,597
What's starting, Ann?

805
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,859
- Trouble.
- You're wrong, darling.

806
01:15:56,336 --> 01:15:59,328
Trouble isn't starting. It's ending.

807
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:04,041
I thought I told you
to put on that satin dress.

808
01:16:04,844 --> 01:16:06,277
I know the truth...

809
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:08,344
...and I believe Rafe.

810
01:16:08,548 --> 01:16:12,507
Well, I'm not exactly
dressed to the nines myself.

811
01:16:13,186 --> 01:16:15,313
Guess it'll be come-as-you-are.

812
01:16:16,789 --> 01:16:17,778
Shall we?

813
01:16:18,091 --> 01:16:21,527
- Shall we what?
- Walk arm in arm down the aisle.

814
01:16:21,728 --> 01:16:23,195
You've lost your mind.

815
01:16:23,396 --> 01:16:24,795
There's no way...

816
01:16:24,998 --> 01:16:26,795
Bruce, please.

817
01:16:27,834 --> 01:16:28,858
Did you say something?

818
01:16:33,039 --> 01:16:34,438
Gene!

819
01:16:34,741 --> 01:16:36,333
Let me go!

820
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:42,138
Somebody help me!

821
01:16:49,422 --> 01:16:51,356
What in the world?

822
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:57,286
Gather the dearly beloved together,
your honor.

823
01:16:57,497 --> 01:16:58,657
We're getting married.

824
01:16:59,832 --> 01:17:01,322
I'll never marry you!

825
01:17:05,271 --> 01:17:06,260
Sheriff.

826
01:17:06,472 --> 01:17:09,270
You gents remove your hats.

827
01:17:10,810 --> 01:17:13,438
If anybody here
objects to this union...

828
01:17:13,646 --> 01:17:16,274
...let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

829
01:17:18,985 --> 01:17:20,179
I object.

830
01:17:25,191 --> 01:17:26,488
Barkow...

831
01:17:28,094 --> 01:17:31,928
...you're the big man in this town,
but this ain't right.

832
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:34,496
Let her go.

833
01:17:34,701 --> 01:17:36,828
Yes, let her go.

834
01:17:37,036 --> 01:17:38,435
Bruce, don't you think you...

835
01:17:38,638 --> 01:17:41,766
Peewee, get back behind the bar
where you belong.

836
01:17:42,508 --> 01:17:44,237
I said let her go.

837
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:48,777
My, oh, my.

838
01:17:48,982 --> 01:17:51,644
You're so brave today, but so...

839
01:17:52,051 --> 01:17:53,951
...badly misguided.

840
01:18:12,872 --> 01:18:14,601
Proceed, Your Honor.

841
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:22,107
Do you, Bruce Barkow...

842
01:18:22,315 --> 01:18:25,341
...take Ann Rodney
to be your lawful wedded wife?

843
01:18:26,486 --> 01:18:27,612
I do.

844
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:31,517
Do you, Ann Rodney, take Bruce Barkow
to be your lawful wedded husband?

845
01:18:31,724 --> 01:18:32,816
I do n...

846
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:36,419
Yes, she does.

847
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:39,727
By the power vested in me...

848
01:18:39,932 --> 01:18:42,901
...by the territorial authority
of Wyoming...

849
01:18:43,202 --> 01:18:46,694
...I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

850
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:03,318
Not my finest hour.

851
01:19:09,696 --> 01:19:12,529
- We can't let this continue.
- Not a lot we can do.

852
01:19:12,732 --> 01:19:15,257
Oh, yes there is.
We can stop being afraid.

853
01:19:15,468 --> 01:19:16,799
He'll kill us, Melissa.

854
01:19:48,401 --> 01:19:50,130
We'll continue this later...

855
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:52,838
...when you've calmed down a touch.

856
01:20:04,751 --> 01:20:06,878
May the road rise to meet you.

857
01:20:07,286 --> 01:20:09,754
May the wind be always at your back.

858
01:20:10,823 --> 01:20:13,383
May the warm sun
shine on your face...

859
01:20:13,593 --> 01:20:16,153
...and a soft rain
fall on your fields.

860
01:20:16,796 --> 01:20:20,664
And until we meet again, may God
hold you in the palm of His hand.

861
01:20:23,102 --> 01:20:27,163
And may you be three days in heaven
before the Devil knows you're dead.

862
01:20:28,674 --> 01:20:29,663
Amen.

863
01:20:52,031 --> 01:20:53,555
How many, you figure?

864
01:20:55,034 --> 01:20:56,467
Only three.

865
01:20:59,806 --> 01:21:01,330
Where are you going?

866
01:21:03,876 --> 01:21:05,366
Just be ready.

867
01:21:57,430 --> 01:22:00,888
- How do you know he'll be there?
- That's where I'd be.

868
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:09,906
I'm not a very good rifle shot,
you know.

869
01:24:32,318 --> 01:24:33,512
Oh, hell.

870
01:25:12,425 --> 01:25:13,414
In here.

871
01:25:13,626 --> 01:25:15,890
The undertaker is in.

872
01:27:33,599 --> 01:27:35,226
Hold on, Joe!

873
01:27:47,846 --> 01:27:49,438
It's a first for me, Joe.

874
01:27:49,648 --> 01:27:50,979
What's that?

875
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:54,277
I've never had to fight my way
into a saloon before.

876
01:28:09,602 --> 01:28:10,728
How many?

877
01:28:10,936 --> 01:28:13,666
Five! -There's something
I need to tell you.

878
01:28:13,872 --> 01:28:15,430
Mrs. Rodney might be in there.

879
01:28:15,641 --> 01:28:18,405
Barkow, he sort of forced her
to marry him yesterday.

880
01:28:18,611 --> 01:28:19,600
What?

881
01:28:20,079 --> 01:28:21,376
They got married.

882
01:28:21,580 --> 01:28:23,275
I heard you!

883
01:28:26,585 --> 01:28:27,574
Barkow!

884
01:28:28,988 --> 01:28:30,979
Still hiding behind that woman?

885
01:28:31,490 --> 01:28:34,152
That's my wife you're talking about!

886
01:28:38,530 --> 01:28:39,861
Send her out!

887
01:28:40,065 --> 01:28:41,657
You come and get her!

888
01:29:10,296 --> 01:29:12,059
Hello, Walter.

889
01:29:15,501 --> 01:29:17,560
Oh, what the hell.

890
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:31,977
We're low on cartridges.

891
01:30:03,282 --> 01:30:05,580
Melissa, thank God.

892
01:30:05,784 --> 01:30:07,615
Come on, we have to be careful.

893
01:32:05,637 --> 01:32:06,831
Joe!

894
01:32:41,273 --> 01:32:43,070
You shot me.

895
01:32:44,209 --> 01:32:47,178
Just when things
were going so well for you.

896
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:19,166
And...

897
01:33:19,545 --> 01:33:21,479
...may the best man win.

898
01:33:48,507 --> 01:33:50,668
No, no, the other arm.

899
01:33:55,347 --> 01:33:56,780
My hat. My hat.

900
01:33:58,684 --> 01:34:00,151
I did something, Melissa.

901
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:03,320
Yes, Gene, you did.

902
01:34:40,924 --> 01:34:43,985
