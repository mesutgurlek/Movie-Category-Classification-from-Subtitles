1
00:00:57,884 --> 00:01:01,149
THE LAST TRAIN

2
00:01:07,327 --> 00:01:09,625
Here and here we can
take on water.

3
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:13,688
How will we tell people?

4
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,461
I told you. MacFerry

5
00:01:15,568 --> 00:01:20,835
and De León will look after
the media side of things.

6
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,899
In the communique I think
we should include an urgent

7
00:01:25,011 --> 00:01:27,775
request for a special tax

8
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:31,544
to increase pensions
by at least fifty percent.

9
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:36,088
I must remind you that
is not on today's agenda.

10
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:37,781
Why a special tax?

11
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:39,085
Can you make ends
meet On your pension?

12
00:01:39,192 --> 00:01:42,559
My daughter maintains me.

13
00:01:42,662 --> 00:01:43,686
What is all this shit?

14
00:01:43,796 --> 00:01:45,127
Wouldn't you help
your daughter?

15
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:46,994
Please... we have
an agenda To keep to.

16
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,933
Let's vote on the plan.

17
00:01:50,036 --> 00:01:51,628
I vote against.

18
00:01:51,738 --> 00:01:53,968
I don't want to be considered

19
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:57,099
a supporter of this illegal act.

20
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,235
As the doctor is always wrong,

21
00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:01,006
I vote in favour.

22
00:02:01,114 --> 00:02:06,711
I don't want any
trouble with the police.

23
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:07,979
MacFerry?

24
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:11,022
In favour.

25
00:02:11,124 --> 00:02:12,682
Rentería?

26
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:14,760
Against.

27
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,597
In favour.

28
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,191
It's a draw so far.

29
00:02:23,303 --> 00:02:25,737
My vote is conditional.

30
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:30,337
In the statutes
there's no such thing.

31
00:02:30,443 --> 00:02:31,910
Then fuck the statutes.

32
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:33,945
Language! I'll expel you...

33
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:39,045
I'll vote in favour if we
can persuade Avilés

34
00:02:39,152 --> 00:02:42,349
to take charge of
the operation.

35
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:45,083
Leave that to me.

36
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:48,019
It won't come out.

37
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:49,822
It's jammed.

38
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:51,590
It won't come out?

39
00:02:51,698 --> 00:02:54,258
OVIEDO TRANSPORT

40
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:00,598
You see?

41
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:02,368
What the hell
are you two doing?

42
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:04,841
Did you do your room?

43
00:03:04,944 --> 00:03:07,208
Go on, hurry up, get
a move on.

44
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:12,347
Why don't you get your
things and just piss off?

45
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,347
No, the thing
is Guito asked me...

46
00:03:17,457 --> 00:03:19,584
Hugo, not Guito.

47
00:03:19,692 --> 00:03:21,557
Hugo, right...

48
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:23,925
And I need your room.

49
00:03:33,473 --> 00:03:36,067
Why did your dad give
him the room free?

50
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:37,836
They were friends.

51
00:03:45,618 --> 00:03:49,213
Pity about your brother.

52
00:03:49,322 --> 00:03:53,759
Those chosen by the
gods die young...

53
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,522
I bet you didn't say that
when you were fifteen.

54
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:59,757
Worthier to die by a fascist's
bullet than in one's bed.

55
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:02,164
You're just an old fool.

56
00:04:02,268 --> 00:04:05,601
It's you who's old. I'm the
same age as my hopes and dreams.

57
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:09,505
Don't tell me, I don't
feel like fighting today.

58
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:12,544
Number 33 is waiting
for somebody with balls

59
00:04:12,645 --> 00:04:14,010
to restore its dignity.

60
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:16,343
Those at the association
are all the same.

61
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:20,078
I didn't come to talk
about that.

62
00:04:20,186 --> 00:04:23,246
I've come to call you
to action.

63
00:04:23,356 --> 00:04:25,324
You've known me for ages.

64
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:26,790
More's the pity.

65
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:31,296
You know I've always been
against acts of violence.

66
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:33,160
Well, have I or haven't I?

67
00:04:33,266 --> 00:04:35,598
And, generally speaking,

68
00:04:35,702 --> 00:04:38,535
violence paves
the way for repression.

69
00:04:38,638 --> 00:04:40,663
But there are times in history...

70
00:04:40,773 --> 00:04:43,173
That's history with a capital H...

71
00:04:43,276 --> 00:04:46,609
when a violent
act is the only way out.

72
00:04:46,713 --> 00:04:49,409
The only way for
decent men to show

73
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:52,882
that they refuse to go on
living on their knees.

74
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:54,475
Here.

75
00:04:57,423 --> 00:05:00,915
Anyway, in short... what
the fuck do you want?

76
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:08,624
I want you to be the
knight in this heroic deed.

77
00:05:11,337 --> 00:05:13,532
Number 33 is counting on you.

78
00:05:22,382 --> 00:05:25,647
Then it's one salami
and two sausages.

79
00:05:25,752 --> 00:05:27,617
What do you think?

80
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,915
No. These two.

81
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,055
I'll get MacFerry.

82
00:06:11,063 --> 00:06:14,624
RESULTS OF TEST

83
00:06:36,956 --> 00:06:38,890
Now, breathing in deeply...

84
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:44,987
And we let our whole body be
taken along by the breeze...

85
00:06:45,097 --> 00:06:47,031
A gentle breeze swaying

86
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:49,033
the trees and plants...

87
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:57,639
Do you want to see
the boys or not?

88
00:07:01,113 --> 00:07:02,876
Do tai chi like everyone else.

89
00:07:02,982 --> 00:07:05,075
I'm not Chinese.

90
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:10,748
It was your turn yesterday.

91
00:07:10,857 --> 00:07:12,290
Today it's mine.

92
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,154
Time for the news.

93
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,889
...with Jaime Ferreira Fink,
the owner of the engine,

94
00:07:17,997 --> 00:07:21,228
which is to have a special
destination, right?

95
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:24,599
That's right. In ten
days' time it'll set out

96
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:27,605
for Hollywood to be
used in a film.

97
00:07:27,707 --> 00:07:30,198
That's the reason for
the whole thing.

98
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:34,712
Our people have been working
on it for the last few days,

99
00:07:34,814 --> 00:07:38,409
putting the finishing touches
so that it can set out.

100
00:07:38,518 --> 00:07:42,682
Was the engine like this before
or was it, shall we say,

101
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:44,119
not quite so ready?

102
00:07:44,223 --> 00:07:48,023
No, it was just scrap. It
was nothing but scrap,

103
00:07:48,127 --> 00:07:53,497
so a lot of work with Uruguayan
labour had to be done on it,

104
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,464
and is still being done.

105
00:07:55,568 --> 00:07:57,593
It's taken a month and a half

106
00:07:57,703 --> 00:08:01,104
to make it as good as new,
as the Americans wanted.

107
00:08:01,207 --> 00:08:02,674
How much did you invest?

108
00:08:07,747 --> 00:08:08,839
Hello.

109
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:10,711
It's " D-Day."

110
00:08:14,253 --> 00:08:15,584
Good.

111
00:08:15,688 --> 00:08:17,849
Call everybody.

112
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:21,188
Hurry up. Always the same.

113
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:32,802
Come on!

114
00:08:51,557 --> 00:08:53,752
Where are we going?

115
00:08:53,859 --> 00:08:55,656
Did you tell your folks?

116
00:08:55,761 --> 00:08:57,695
Mum...

117
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,113
What did the doctor say?

118
00:09:16,215 --> 00:09:19,810
Nothing, nothing...

119
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,648
Just a nervous complaint.

120
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:18,534
Blackie! Blackie!

121
00:10:30,823 --> 00:10:33,053
-What is it?
-Can we come in?

122
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:36,617
-At this time? What for?
-To steal the engine.

123
00:10:36,729 --> 00:10:40,028
He's always joking...

124
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:42,600
To take some pictures
before it goes.

125
00:10:42,702 --> 00:10:45,170
That'd put me
in a difficult position.

126
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:47,796
There are valuable items.

127
00:10:47,907 --> 00:10:50,375
Here, take this.

128
00:10:50,476 --> 00:10:52,637
Have a drink on us.

129
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:15,594
I've recorded that you're
five minutes late.

130
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:18,899
Record the kick I'm
going to give you.

131
00:11:19,004 --> 00:11:20,631
Oh, I'm so scared!

132
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,004
This is no time for fighting.

133
00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:24,201
He's provoking me.

134
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,868
-Shall I get the things?
-Right.

135
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:28,708
-Yes, yes.
-What's that?

136
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:31,612
-You've done it now!
-Record it.

137
00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:33,048
He's the fireman.

138
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:34,449
You can't bring him along!

139
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:35,918
Why not?

140
00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:38,615
Look, 33 isn't a carousel, Pepe.

141
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:40,316
Stoking's not an easy job.

142
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:42,394
Who's going to do it? You?

143
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:44,463
Your hands are used to books.

144
00:11:44,563 --> 00:11:47,225
He's only a child.
We can't take him.

145
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:53,699
All right.

146
00:11:53,806 --> 00:11:55,330
You're not being democratic.

147
00:11:55,441 --> 00:11:58,638
You have to go along
with the majority.

148
00:11:58,744 --> 00:12:00,939
If that absent-minded
old fool will stoke coal

149
00:12:01,046 --> 00:12:03,606
then Guito stays here.

150
00:12:05,618 --> 00:12:07,745
I've got high blood pressure.

151
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,174
My Sophia Loren!

152
00:12:37,283 --> 00:12:39,080
Who?

153
00:12:39,185 --> 00:12:41,119
Madonna, then.

154
00:13:07,713 --> 00:13:10,807
My black beauty.

155
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,680
I'll take good care of you.

156
00:13:19,558 --> 00:13:22,049
Come on, let's get moving.

157
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:25,822
So you're the
Professor's nephew.

158
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:28,559
My mother was his sister.

159
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:32,398
-Can I stop a minute? I need...
-I'm afraid not, young man.

160
00:13:32,504 --> 00:13:36,065
-Just to...
-We're late as it is.

161
00:13:36,175 --> 00:13:38,200
Have you passed wind?

162
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,676
I'm a man in control
of his sphincter.

163
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,680
Review your troops.
Perhaps one of your men...

164
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:46,751
My orifices respond
to natural controls.

165
00:13:49,989 --> 00:13:52,856
Come on boy, wake up!

166
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:18,283
-Good, my black beauty!
-The door! The door!

167
00:14:18,384 --> 00:14:20,944
As if it were made
of paper!

168
00:14:26,592 --> 00:14:28,958
Gave you a fright, eh?

169
00:14:49,415 --> 00:14:52,543
Grandma's last jewel
is not for sale!

170
00:14:55,621 --> 00:14:57,316
Did you see them gaping?

171
00:14:57,423 --> 00:14:59,550
Like a dragon was passing.

172
00:14:59,658 --> 00:15:02,752
That reminds me of
a story by Bradbury.

173
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:07,730
About two mediaeval knights
on the way to the Crusades.

174
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:11,599
They see a bright light
and hear a terrible noise.

175
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:14,502
"A dragon!" says one,
raising his lance.

176
00:15:14,606 --> 00:15:18,007
"Aim for the eye!"
says the other,

177
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:23,514
and bravely they both charge
at the thing approaching them.

178
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:31,648
And the train knocks
the shit out of them.

179
00:15:33,158 --> 00:15:35,126
-I don't get it.
-Because you're stupid.

180
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:36,558
It's very simple.

181
00:15:36,662 --> 00:15:38,095
Did you get it?

182
00:15:38,197 --> 00:15:40,131
More or less...

183
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:42,700
You explain, if
you're so clever.

184
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:45,269
You wouldn't understand anyway.

185
00:15:45,371 --> 00:15:47,635
Stop it!

186
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:51,600
It was a story by Bradbury.

187
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,440
-Ray Bradbury!
-Ray!

188
00:15:54,546 --> 00:15:56,537
About a time tunnel.

189
00:15:56,648 --> 00:16:01,847
The knights go from the road
onto the railway lines.

190
00:16:01,954 --> 00:16:04,479
For me, the main point

191
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,650
is that the knights
don't hesitate,

192
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,751
not for a moment,

193
00:16:09,862 --> 00:16:11,853
and they die fighting.

194
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,696
We wish to notify the public

195
00:16:17,803 --> 00:16:19,703
that the " Friends of the Rails"

196
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:22,137
have decided that
locomotive number 33,

197
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:24,334
a jewel in the national crown,

198
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,934
be returned to the
people of Uruguay.

199
00:16:27,046 --> 00:16:29,071
With this our aim,

200
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:32,844
we have decided to take
expropriational action

201
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,441
which will cease

202
00:16:34,553 --> 00:16:38,216
only when the following
conditions are met.

203
00:16:38,323 --> 00:16:39,984
One... locomotive number 33

204
00:16:40,092 --> 00:16:43,118
shall be declared a
national historic monument

205
00:16:43,228 --> 00:16:47,130
in order to prevent the
purchase by foreign capital

206
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:51,134
of this, the last symbol
of the once booming

207
00:16:51,236 --> 00:16:54,262
railway network of our
small, dear nation.

208
00:16:54,373 --> 00:16:58,400
We also demand the government
create a special...

209
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,944
No, no, no, not that!

210
00:17:01,046 --> 00:17:04,482
-Fuck off! Keep filming.
-It's not relevant!

211
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,016
It's not relevant!

212
00:17:26,205 --> 00:17:27,069
Right...

213
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,969
that's it.

214
00:17:29,074 --> 00:17:31,099
Okay, Guito, pressure's up.

215
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,442
My black beauty with
the heart of fire!

216
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:38,243
It's not a machine,
it's a person.

217
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,877
With every sound, she
tells you how she feels.

218
00:17:41,987 --> 00:17:44,785
And what's that?

219
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:49,224
It's a manner of speaking.
Can you hear? She's happy.

220
00:17:49,328 --> 00:17:51,421
She's better than ever!

221
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,623
-That's phase one complete.
-Shit!

222
00:17:53,732 --> 00:17:55,393
We forgot the banner.

223
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:58,937
You did. Why bother
to write things down?

224
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:03,804
-You write it down then!
-I'll stuff that down your throat!

225
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:06,901
-Come on, boys.
-Him and his notebook!

226
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:07,910
Unite, brothers.

227
00:18:14,653 --> 00:18:15,745
The minutes...

228
00:18:15,854 --> 00:18:18,152
Include in the minutes

229
00:18:18,257 --> 00:18:19,952
our first victory!

230
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:22,049
-What's the date?
-The 22nd.

231
00:18:22,161 --> 00:18:24,186
The twenty second of what?

232
00:18:24,296 --> 00:18:26,025
-November.
-November. Of course.

233
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:28,361
Twenty second of November.

234
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:29,832
Come on, Pepe.

235
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:34,804
-Show me how to drive.
-Show everybody.

236
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:40,106
If the old relic dropped
dead, we'd be in the shit.

237
00:18:40,212 --> 00:18:43,477
Look then. It's
really easy, a joy.

238
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:46,847
Once pressure's up,
you pull this lever

239
00:18:46,952 --> 00:18:49,750
to speed up or slow down.

240
00:18:49,855 --> 00:18:52,153
This lever operates the brake.

241
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:55,522
You turn this handle to the left

242
00:18:55,627 --> 00:18:59,859
to reverse, and to the
right to go forward.

243
00:18:59,965 --> 00:19:03,230
It's all very easy
but very important.

244
00:19:03,335 --> 00:19:04,199
But really...

245
00:19:04,303 --> 00:19:07,568
know what you need
most of all?

246
00:19:07,673 --> 00:19:08,537
Well... Feeling.

247
00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:20,812
This is the police station.

248
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:22,944
Would Mr. Jaime Ferreira Fink

249
00:19:23,055 --> 00:19:25,990
please get in touch
with us urgently?

250
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:28,082
This is Inspector Ponce.

251
00:19:28,193 --> 00:19:30,525
-Six-thirty a.m.
-Exactly, six-thirty a.m.

252
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:33,291
I should be in bed, not here.

253
00:19:33,398 --> 00:19:37,266
Look, I know you're the
victim, but I'm in charge.

254
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:39,269
-You're in charge?
-Yes, sir.

255
00:19:46,778 --> 00:19:48,143
Carlos?

256
00:19:48,247 --> 00:19:50,977
This is Jimmy.
Sorry it's so early.

257
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:54,644
Really bad, my
engine's been stolen.

258
00:19:54,753 --> 00:19:57,745
My engine! Yes,
you heard right.

259
00:19:57,856 --> 00:19:59,687
I couldn't believe it either.

260
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,726
I haven't the faintest idea.

261
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:05,626
At the police station
with one of your men.

262
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:08,632
Ponce, and he isn't
showing much respect.

263
00:20:08,734 --> 00:20:10,099
I'll put him on.

264
00:20:10,202 --> 00:20:11,635
Here.

265
00:20:11,737 --> 00:20:12,863
Thank you.

266
00:20:12,971 --> 00:20:14,905
Hello?

267
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,338
Yes, sir.

268
00:20:16,441 --> 00:20:17,931
Yes, sir, yes.

269
00:20:18,043 --> 00:20:20,477
If you'll allow me...

270
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:24,345
I understand, sir.

271
00:20:24,449 --> 00:20:27,111
Whatever you say.
I'll put him back on.

272
00:20:27,219 --> 00:20:29,517
Thanks, Carlos.

273
00:20:29,621 --> 00:20:32,681
I'll let you know. I hope
everything works out.

274
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,191
Say hello to Estela for me.

275
00:20:35,294 --> 00:20:39,355
The cameraman works for
T.V. so we let him go.

276
00:20:39,464 --> 00:20:41,432
But he was an accomplice.

277
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,899
-We've got his details.
-The recording?

278
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,412
Here it is.

279
00:20:57,516 --> 00:20:59,916
Thank you.

280
00:21:12,964 --> 00:21:15,364
"Arrested for public
disturbance..."

281
00:21:15,467 --> 00:21:17,867
In the sixties.

282
00:21:22,107 --> 00:21:23,768
"Member of the
Communist Party..."

283
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,672
That's not a crime.

284
00:21:25,777 --> 00:21:29,304
Of course not but it
gives you a clearer idea.

285
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:32,110
I want to speak
to this one alone.

286
00:21:39,825 --> 00:21:41,793
I'm sorry a man your age

287
00:21:41,893 --> 00:21:44,726
has got himself into
such a nasty business.

288
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,634
Yet we're both in this
for the same reason...

289
00:21:52,738 --> 00:21:55,832
Our love of trains, right?

290
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:08,413
But the difference is that I
think you can't halt progress.

291
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:17,756
Do you really think some
politician will stand up for you?

292
00:22:19,498 --> 00:22:21,830
I'm afraid not.

293
00:22:24,836 --> 00:22:26,804
Manuel...

294
00:22:26,905 --> 00:22:30,341
Can I call you Manuel?

295
00:22:30,442 --> 00:22:33,070
Thank you.

296
00:22:33,178 --> 00:22:36,705
Manuel, we both know
that when the police

297
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:42,185
go out after that engine,
anything could happen, right?

298
00:22:42,287 --> 00:22:46,815
It could get violent,
and nobody wants that,

299
00:22:46,925 --> 00:22:49,120
least of all me.

300
00:22:49,227 --> 00:22:52,719
So I'm asking you to
cooperate with me.

301
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:57,632
Let's work out a solution
together. What do you say?

302
00:23:24,996 --> 00:23:27,396
You see, I was right.

303
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,667
-How are you, my old chum?
-I knew you'd do it.

304
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:43,139
Over here.

305
00:23:43,248 --> 00:23:45,614
Whenever you like.

306
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,822
OUR NATIONAL HERITAGE
IS NOT FOR SALE

307
00:24:01,933 --> 00:24:05,096
What about the provisions?
The provisions?

308
00:24:05,203 --> 00:24:06,932
Professor, where did
you put the food?

309
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:09,336
That was your job!

310
00:24:09,441 --> 00:24:12,899
-Look in your book.
-No, not the book.

311
00:24:16,147 --> 00:24:17,876
Hell and damnation!

312
00:24:17,983 --> 00:24:20,110
I forgot the provisions!

313
00:24:20,218 --> 00:24:21,776
Then we won't get very far.

314
00:24:21,887 --> 00:24:24,014
At our age, we can
go without food.

315
00:24:24,122 --> 00:24:25,919
What's the matter with
you? Are you blind?

316
00:24:26,024 --> 00:24:28,458
What about the boy?

317
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,358
-He needs to eat!
-So why didn't you bring...?

318
00:24:31,463 --> 00:24:33,897
What's your notebook for?

319
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:35,523
All right...

320
00:24:35,634 --> 00:24:37,693
-For fuck's...
-What's it for?

321
00:24:37,802 --> 00:24:40,771
Will you calm down,
please? Calm down!

322
00:24:40,872 --> 00:24:42,237
We'll have to stop.

323
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,570
Stop? Where?

324
00:24:44,676 --> 00:24:46,644
If he's hungry he can go.

325
00:24:46,745 --> 00:24:48,406
You voted for me to
stay, so fuck off!

326
00:24:48,513 --> 00:24:51,038
You've got it in for me.

327
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:53,811
I'm sorry.

328
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,853
It's just that I... I... I...

329
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:58,218
I... I... I...

330
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,360
Hello? Who's there?

331
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:06,089
Hello. Yes.

332
00:25:06,197 --> 00:25:08,165
Eight years.

333
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:09,858
Who is this?

334
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:12,334
Article 178, five years for robbery,

335
00:25:12,437 --> 00:25:14,405
and Article 306, three years

336
00:25:14,506 --> 00:25:16,906
for conspiracy to
commit a crime.

337
00:25:17,008 --> 00:25:20,500
You've got to catch
us first, Mr...?

338
00:25:20,612 --> 00:25:22,876
Jimmy. You can call
me Jimmy.

339
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:24,710
Are you the police?

340
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:27,410
I'm surprised you've
forgotten, Professor.

341
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:29,885
I'm the owner of
the locomotive.

342
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:32,957
Tell me what you
want. I'm very busy.

343
00:25:33,058 --> 00:25:35,117
And what do you want?

344
00:25:35,226 --> 00:25:38,627
I want the progressive
forces in our country

345
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,789
to stop this ignominious sale.

346
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:42,958
Give me a progressive's name

347
00:25:43,068 --> 00:25:48,631
and you can ring him and ask
him what he's going to do.

348
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,766
Listen, Professor.
You know this is madness.

349
00:25:51,876 --> 00:25:55,812
That's what they said when
the Bastille was stormed.

350
00:25:55,914 --> 00:25:59,850
This isn't a history lesson,
Professor. It's a crime.

351
00:25:59,951 --> 00:26:01,646
And you can't win.

352
00:26:01,753 --> 00:26:04,347
Then why bother to call me?

353
00:26:04,456 --> 00:26:06,686
I don't want any bloodshed.

354
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:08,850
Now you listen to me.

355
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,587
If any blood's shed,

356
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:13,220
the press will be very interested.

357
00:26:13,331 --> 00:26:18,132
Talking of the press, your
nephew's video's pretty bad.

358
00:26:18,236 --> 00:26:22,502
You're an educated man.
Admit it's all over.

359
00:26:22,607 --> 00:26:26,008
I don't know if you
realise, young man,

360
00:26:26,111 --> 00:26:29,376
that I'm talking to you
from an engine

361
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:32,143
that's going at full speed. Listen!

362
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,447
And I'm talking to you
from a police car

363
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:38,021
that's on the way to arrest you.

364
00:26:38,123 --> 00:26:40,614
Cooperate like De
León and MacFerry did.

365
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:42,215
-That's a lie!
-Me?

366
00:26:42,327 --> 00:26:43,817
Professor, tell that gentleman

367
00:26:43,928 --> 00:26:47,386
who was born in Oviedo
to mind his language.

368
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:49,433
I didn't raise my voice.

369
00:26:49,534 --> 00:26:51,468
Professor, give me the
engine back

370
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:54,538
and I'll try and
sort things out for you.

371
00:26:54,639 --> 00:26:58,268
Or I'll leave things to agent
Ponce who's with me here.

372
00:26:58,376 --> 00:27:02,335
He's the chief of the riot
squad and a very efficient man.

373
00:27:02,447 --> 00:27:03,709
Know what I mean?

374
00:27:03,815 --> 00:27:05,715
You can tell that Ponce

375
00:27:05,817 --> 00:27:09,719
that if his men lay
a finger on this engine,

376
00:27:09,821 --> 00:27:11,755
I'll turn it into scrap!

377
00:27:11,856 --> 00:27:12,982
Do you hear? Pepe!

378
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:17,394
-What are you doing?
-They got those silly old fools...

379
00:27:17,495 --> 00:27:19,395
You should look at yourself.

380
00:27:19,497 --> 00:27:20,987
Then it's Plan B.

381
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:22,999
It's Plan Z for me.

382
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:25,001
Are all Asturians like him?

383
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:28,732
-As excessive as him, you mean?
-Yes, excessive, extensive...

384
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,037
-Mad! For goodness sake!
-Guito, come here.

385
00:27:32,143 --> 00:27:36,807
You've got good eyesight.
Help me look for the battery.

386
00:27:36,915 --> 00:27:41,113
-What's up, Pepe?
-We have to slow down.

387
00:27:41,219 --> 00:27:42,709
The line's fucked.

388
00:27:57,969 --> 00:27:59,596
Antonio?

389
00:28:01,106 --> 00:28:03,040
Antonio?

390
00:28:16,121 --> 00:28:18,089
<i>Our love is so vast</i>

391
00:28:18,189 --> 00:28:20,384
<i>that it never ends,</i>

392
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:22,960
<i>and life so short</i>

393
00:28:23,061 --> 00:28:26,030
<i>it is not</i>
<i>enough for our idyll.</i>

394
00:28:56,427 --> 00:28:57,894
Ponce.

395
00:28:57,996 --> 00:29:00,294
What's he doing?

396
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:01,797
His duty.

397
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,162
What's the gun for?

398
00:29:03,268 --> 00:29:05,896
He always carries one
in cases like this.

399
00:29:06,004 --> 00:29:08,404
Remember this is a
bunch of old men.

400
00:29:08,506 --> 00:29:10,474
I don't think so.

401
00:29:10,575 --> 00:29:13,738
You hear of the occasional
senile old man with a gun.

402
00:29:13,845 --> 00:29:16,871
Last month a pensioner
fired a shotgun at us.

403
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:21,748
There's no way I'll
risk my men's lives.

404
00:29:21,853 --> 00:29:24,151
Did you know that
dishonourable discharge

405
00:29:24,255 --> 00:29:27,053
means loss
of all entitlements,

406
00:29:27,158 --> 00:29:30,457
including a pension?

407
00:29:34,132 --> 00:29:36,532
Boys, put your guns away.

408
00:29:36,634 --> 00:29:40,126
Might scare the old fogeys.

409
00:29:58,223 --> 00:30:00,191
Now what are you doing?

410
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:04,728
Look, is this a gang of
crazy old men or what?

411
00:30:04,829 --> 00:30:08,424
If they are, they'll
stop when they see this.

412
00:30:08,533 --> 00:30:10,899
And if they don't know how?

413
00:30:11,002 --> 00:30:13,368
I don't want
my engine damaged.

414
00:30:13,471 --> 00:30:17,908
Either we let them through
or we try to stop them.

415
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:35,786
My dad was a miner.

416
00:30:35,894 --> 00:30:38,294
So for my brother
and me, explosives

417
00:30:38,396 --> 00:30:40,455
were something we
knew all about.

418
00:30:40,565 --> 00:30:42,294
How did you use them?

419
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,493
That's where
the engine came in.

420
00:30:44,602 --> 00:30:47,799
We'd go out at night
looking for Franco's men.

421
00:30:47,906 --> 00:30:51,933
It was my job to drive
the engine at full speed.

422
00:30:52,043 --> 00:30:54,944
We'd appear, like the
dragon in the story

423
00:30:55,046 --> 00:30:56,445
the Professor told, remember?

424
00:30:56,547 --> 00:30:59,846
I can still hear their
bullets on the engine...

425
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:00,975
What did you do?

426
00:31:01,085 --> 00:31:04,816
My brother and the militia
hid with the fuses lit,

427
00:31:04,923 --> 00:31:06,754
and as we went past...

428
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:17,332
Of course, after a
time word of our tactics got out,

429
00:31:17,435 --> 00:31:21,633
and one night they were waiting
for us with an anti-tank gun.

430
00:31:21,739 --> 00:31:24,537
The police! The police!

431
00:31:24,642 --> 00:31:26,872
What's that on the line, Pepe?

432
00:31:30,548 --> 00:31:32,607
Here they come.

433
00:31:45,463 --> 00:31:47,328
Brake, brake!

434
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:54,732
Brake, Pepe, brake!

435
00:31:57,442 --> 00:31:59,933
Brake, for fuck's sake! Brake!

436
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:05,181
Fuck them!

437
00:32:14,692 --> 00:32:16,660
Did you see the boy?

438
00:32:16,761 --> 00:32:18,922
-What boy?
-The boy!

439
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:23,258
Guito!

440
00:32:23,368 --> 00:32:25,233
Come and stoke.

441
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:30,367
-Almost derailed us!
-But we're serious.

442
00:32:30,475 --> 00:32:31,908
You forgot the boy!

443
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,978
That was irresponsible
of you, Pepe.

444
00:32:36,314 --> 00:32:38,214
But really...

445
00:32:38,316 --> 00:32:41,410
full of poetry.

446
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,214
As Gandhi would say,

447
00:32:43,321 --> 00:32:45,949
"Caught them with
their trousers down."

448
00:32:46,057 --> 00:32:49,117
You break my balls because I
don't bring the kid any food,

449
00:32:49,227 --> 00:32:50,694
and you congratulate
this madman

450
00:32:50,795 --> 00:32:52,285
for almost getting us killed!

451
00:32:52,397 --> 00:32:55,127
I feel like getting off now!

452
00:33:12,517 --> 00:33:17,614
Pepe, we're going
to have to stop.

453
00:33:17,722 --> 00:33:19,883
We really are.

454
00:33:19,991 --> 00:33:23,427
If the media don't hear about
this, there's no point to it.

455
00:33:23,528 --> 00:33:25,758
Stop? Have you gone mad?

456
00:33:25,863 --> 00:33:29,822
What if the T.V. cameras had
been back there with the police?

457
00:33:29,934 --> 00:33:31,799
Everybody would be talking
about what we're doing.

458
00:33:31,903 --> 00:33:35,395
And that's what
we want, isn't it?

459
00:33:38,543 --> 00:33:40,534
Let me see...

460
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,144
Perhaps there.

461
00:33:45,249 --> 00:33:47,114
At this station.

462
00:33:47,218 --> 00:33:49,846
-It's isolated.
-That's what I mean.

463
00:33:49,954 --> 00:33:52,013
-How far is it?
-20 minutes away.

464
00:33:56,494 --> 00:33:59,429
Look, the thing with
the police car worked out

465
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,088
but it might not have.

466
00:34:01,199 --> 00:34:03,463
Mind you, they
know we're serious now

467
00:34:03,568 --> 00:34:05,536
so it'll be harder next time.

468
00:34:05,636 --> 00:34:07,604
It's a risk we have to take.

469
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:16,974
Pepe, Guito can't
stay here with us.

470
00:34:23,321 --> 00:34:24,583
Okay, you're right.

471
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:27,817
Guito can get off
whenever you like.

472
00:34:27,925 --> 00:34:30,655
And I'll get off with him.

473
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:44,304
Kramer, we could divert
them after that bend.

474
00:34:44,408 --> 00:34:47,002
-Where is the bend?
-There.

475
00:34:47,111 --> 00:34:49,944
-And after it?
-A siding.

476
00:34:52,483 --> 00:34:56,579
Ponce, imagine
you get home one day

477
00:34:56,687 --> 00:34:58,985
and find thieves inside.

478
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,217
Do you set
fire to the house?

479
00:35:01,325 --> 00:35:02,485
Not a bad idea.

480
00:35:02,593 --> 00:35:03,753
We did that once.

481
00:35:03,861 --> 00:35:06,329
-Your house?
-No, the man who called us.

482
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,590
I said your house.

483
00:35:07,698 --> 00:35:09,893
A few flames
wouldn't do any harm.

484
00:35:10,001 --> 00:35:12,629
They'd shit
themselves and stop.

485
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:16,002
You've no idea how
much an engine costs.

486
00:35:16,107 --> 00:35:16,903
-Well, actually...
-Yes?

487
00:35:17,008 --> 00:35:17,497
I don't.

488
00:35:17,608 --> 00:35:20,907
A lot and I don't want
it stuck in a siding.

489
00:35:21,012 --> 00:35:22,570
Understand?

490
00:35:24,749 --> 00:35:28,082
We need to use something
you obviously don't have.

491
00:35:28,186 --> 00:35:30,017
We're very well
equipped, Ferreira.

492
00:35:30,121 --> 00:35:32,282
Really?

493
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,584
This genetic equipment...

494
00:35:33,691 --> 00:35:36,660
even with a brain
transplant you'd fail.

495
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:41,494
Put police along the line to
stop them taking on water.

496
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,467
Find the old men's relatives
and the boy's parents.

497
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,231
Why so much fuss?

498
00:35:47,338 --> 00:35:49,306
And look up " genetic"
in the dictionary.

499
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,038
Haven't you got
anything thicker?

500
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:27,633
No, I've sold out of those,

501
00:36:27,745 --> 00:36:29,576
but these are very popular.

502
00:36:31,482 --> 00:36:33,473
Don't know if they're
any good to me.

503
00:36:33,584 --> 00:36:35,609
Trouble with the bladder?

504
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,349
I had a prostate operation
and I leak a bit now.

505
00:36:39,457 --> 00:36:42,358
So two litre bottles of water

506
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,020
and did you slice
the salami thick?

507
00:36:45,129 --> 00:36:47,256
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

508
00:36:47,365 --> 00:36:49,595
You're okay, you're a
journalist.

509
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,498
Yes, uncle, but it's a
wonder they didn't keep me in.

510
00:36:52,603 --> 00:36:55,595
Look, Daniel. Do you
want to be a second-rate

511
00:36:55,706 --> 00:36:57,674
cameraman the
rest of your life?

512
00:36:57,775 --> 00:37:01,438
Then this is your chance to
make people look at you.

513
00:37:01,545 --> 00:37:05,538
Breaks like this one only come
along or times in a lifetime.

514
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,379
-Yes, but...
-I love you,

515
00:37:07,485 --> 00:37:09,214
that's why I'm telling you.

516
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:13,689
Stop shitting your pants, you
were born with a pair of balls.

517
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:16,225
What do you want me to do?

518
00:37:16,327 --> 00:37:18,386
They took the video off you,

519
00:37:18,496 --> 00:37:29,634
so go and tell your
people what you saw.

520
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,367
What you witnessed.

521
00:37:33,177 --> 00:37:35,611
-They stole the engine?
-Yes.

522
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:38,375
-Where's the video?
-Police headquarters, I think.

523
00:37:38,482 --> 00:37:41,474
-What do you mean you think?
-At police headquarters.

524
00:37:44,188 --> 00:37:45,917
Who are you calling?

525
00:37:46,023 --> 00:37:48,321
Our contact there,
who do you think?

526
00:37:49,427 --> 00:37:52,692
I beg you, fellow countrymen...

527
00:37:52,797 --> 00:37:55,391
Spread the news.

528
00:37:55,499 --> 00:38:00,232
Tell the world that a
sepoy from the east,

529
00:38:00,338 --> 00:38:04,035
in connivance with
the American empire,

530
00:38:04,141 --> 00:38:07,372
would deprive us of
this thing of beauty.

531
00:38:07,478 --> 00:38:09,708
He wants to sell it!

532
00:38:09,814 --> 00:38:14,012
Taking it forever
beyond our frontiers!

533
00:38:14,118 --> 00:38:16,450
I beg you! I beg you!

534
00:38:35,906 --> 00:38:37,931
Good news and
not so good news.

535
00:38:39,744 --> 00:38:41,769
The not so good first.

536
00:38:41,879 --> 00:38:44,814
The professor's
wife can't be found.

537
00:38:44,915 --> 00:38:48,043
So an old lady's too
much for your men?

538
00:38:48,152 --> 00:38:51,019
Those men have picked
the boy's parents up.

539
00:38:58,028 --> 00:38:59,655
Yes.

540
00:38:59,764 --> 00:39:03,791
I was lucky enough to film
the engine being driven away.

541
00:39:03,901 --> 00:39:08,270
Montecarlo is the only channel to
have had access to the footage.

542
00:39:08,372 --> 00:39:10,932
Let's see a preview.

543
00:39:12,543 --> 00:39:14,738
This means your job, Ponce.

544
00:39:16,514 --> 00:39:18,448
-I'll have you fired.
-It wasn't me.

545
00:39:18,549 --> 00:39:23,509
-Wasn't you?
-I was with you all the time.

546
00:39:23,621 --> 00:39:25,350
I'll open an inquiry to
see who's responsible.

547
00:39:25,456 --> 00:39:27,424
So it wasn't you? I
prefer a bent copper

548
00:39:27,525 --> 00:39:29,254
to an idiot who can't
control his people.

549
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,157
Hello? This is Jimmy.

550
00:39:31,262 --> 00:39:34,527
Give me Channel Four's number,
please. The direct line.

551
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,025
Yes... It doesn't
matter, Ramírez.

552
00:39:39,136 --> 00:39:41,127
You open the inquiry.

553
00:39:41,238 --> 00:39:43,832
How much did you get?

554
00:39:43,941 --> 00:39:45,340
You're an idiot, Ramírez.

555
00:39:45,443 --> 00:39:48,344
A scoop like that
is worth much more.

556
00:39:48,446 --> 00:39:50,209
No...

557
00:39:50,314 --> 00:39:52,282
Call and say you got it wrong.

558
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:03,789
First of all...

559
00:40:03,894 --> 00:40:06,954
Guito.

560
00:40:07,064 --> 00:40:09,794
Then this pain in the neck.

561
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,368
And this is mine. Professor.

562
00:40:15,272 --> 00:40:17,706
Did you only buy salami? Why?

563
00:40:18,976 --> 00:40:20,637
Because I like it.

564
00:40:20,744 --> 00:40:22,905
You could have got
some fat-free cheese.

565
00:40:23,013 --> 00:40:25,504
At our age so much fat is bad.

566
00:40:25,616 --> 00:40:29,074
At our age, all's good...

567
00:40:29,186 --> 00:40:31,586
The arteries in
your head are clogged

568
00:40:31,689 --> 00:40:33,748
from all the crap you eat!

569
00:40:33,858 --> 00:40:38,192
I prefer that to just
eating boiled vegetables.

570
00:40:38,295 --> 00:40:42,755
Professor, you know I've got
nothing in common with this idiot.

571
00:40:42,867 --> 00:40:43,993
But this time,

572
00:40:44,101 --> 00:40:47,764
it breaks my heart to
say that he's right.

573
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,670
This salami is marvellous.
It's wonderful.

574
00:40:50,774 --> 00:40:52,674
Ah, do what you like!

575
00:40:52,776 --> 00:40:56,906
Who am I to lecture you on the
connection between a bad diet

576
00:40:57,014 --> 00:40:59,107
and heart disease...

577
00:40:59,216 --> 00:41:01,150
You'll find out for yourselves.

578
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:02,810
Here.

579
00:41:05,055 --> 00:41:06,420
You're from this generation.

580
00:41:06,524 --> 00:41:08,992
See if you can work this out.

581
00:41:18,002 --> 00:41:19,697
Is that it?

582
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:24,669
Things like that make me feel
like a useless old fool.

583
00:41:24,775 --> 00:41:26,743
Thanks, kid.

584
00:41:34,985 --> 00:41:37,180
Dani, please. Thanks.

585
00:41:39,423 --> 00:41:43,359
Dani?

586
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,087
Really?

587
00:41:45,195 --> 00:41:47,595
Great, Dani.

588
00:41:47,698 --> 00:41:50,496
My sister, wherever she is,
would be proud of you.

589
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:52,398
Gentlemen.

590
00:41:52,503 --> 00:41:55,836
Phase two completed with
total and absolute success.

591
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,273
Thousands of people just
saw this mighty machine

592
00:41:59,376 --> 00:42:01,742
break down the
doors of its prison.

593
00:42:13,824 --> 00:42:15,689
What do they want now?

594
00:42:15,793 --> 00:42:18,455
I don't know, but
they'll try and board us.

595
00:42:18,562 --> 00:42:21,190
They can't. They'd
need a bridge for that.

596
00:42:29,907 --> 00:42:31,568
We must let Guito off.

597
00:42:34,511 --> 00:42:36,376
You know that very well.

598
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,641
They're trying to put pressure on.

599
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:43,950
It's leaking.

600
00:42:47,825 --> 00:42:49,383
Mr. Secretary,

601
00:42:49,493 --> 00:42:52,018
did you buy that sealant?

602
00:42:58,636 --> 00:43:00,467
Here.

603
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,864
What the hell's this?

604
00:43:04,975 --> 00:43:06,670
Glue.

605
00:43:06,777 --> 00:43:09,109
But it says it's for false teeth!

606
00:43:09,213 --> 00:43:12,376
One of the hardest
things to stick.

607
00:43:12,483 --> 00:43:15,077
The bastard!
He gives me this crap!

608
00:43:15,185 --> 00:43:16,743
Give it here.

609
00:43:16,854 --> 00:43:18,446
What needs sealing,

610
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:21,422
apart from this argumentative
fanatic's mouth?

611
00:43:30,968 --> 00:43:32,367
Well?

612
00:43:32,469 --> 00:43:33,868
What have you got to say?

613
00:43:33,971 --> 00:43:35,871
It was a fluke.

614
00:43:35,973 --> 00:43:38,840
But then, that's typical
of silly old fools.

615
00:43:40,811 --> 00:43:42,779
We're absolutely devastated.

616
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,849
We'd always treated
Pepe like family.

617
00:43:45,949 --> 00:43:47,746
We gave him a room,

618
00:43:47,851 --> 00:43:51,947
and look what he did, taking
our son, making him steal...

619
00:43:52,056 --> 00:43:56,959
I don't really think these people's
pain was in the plans of those

620
00:43:57,061 --> 00:43:58,494
who took the engine.

621
00:43:58,595 --> 00:44:02,691
They're not hardened criminals,
just a group of senile old men.

622
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,233
They're all on medication.

623
00:44:04,334 --> 00:44:06,529
They're mainly
a danger to themselves.

624
00:44:06,637 --> 00:44:08,832
I ask all Uruguayans of goodwill

625
00:44:08,939 --> 00:44:10,736
to cooperate with the authorities,

626
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:13,139
who are doing everything they can.

627
00:44:13,243 --> 00:44:17,179
Inspector, what's being done to
recover the engine?

628
00:44:17,281 --> 00:44:20,114
As long as the boy
is on board,

629
00:44:20,217 --> 00:44:23,812
our main aim is to try
to recover the locomotive

630
00:44:23,921 --> 00:44:25,320
without anyone getting hurt.

631
00:44:25,422 --> 00:44:27,617
Right, well thank you all.

632
00:44:52,483 --> 00:44:54,883
Who's that?

633
00:44:54,985 --> 00:44:56,748
My wife.

634
00:44:56,854 --> 00:45:00,153
Your wife? Aren't you
too old to be married?

635
00:45:00,257 --> 00:45:02,521
What do you mean?

636
00:45:02,626 --> 00:45:05,288
All the men of
your age that I know...

637
00:45:05,395 --> 00:45:07,886
are widowers.

638
00:45:07,998 --> 00:45:10,125
What about Pepe?
He's single.

639
00:45:10,234 --> 00:45:12,634
He's much younger than you.

640
00:45:18,609 --> 00:45:22,067
And why were
you looking at her?

641
00:45:22,179 --> 00:45:25,478
Because I like to.
I wanted to see

642
00:45:25,582 --> 00:45:27,174
a thing of beauty.

643
00:45:27,284 --> 00:45:29,548
She's got a nice face.

644
00:45:29,653 --> 00:45:33,589
Look, if you don't like her,
just tell me so. It's okay.

645
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:34,418
Careful, Guito.

646
00:45:34,525 --> 00:45:37,824
Leave Micaela alone or
you'll be in trouble.

647
00:45:37,928 --> 00:45:39,691
She's not ugly...

648
00:45:42,332 --> 00:45:43,026
That's something.

649
00:45:43,133 --> 00:45:47,069
Come on then, name a woman
you think is beautiful.

650
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:50,306
My mother...

651
00:45:50,407 --> 00:45:52,375
Not now,

652
00:45:52,476 --> 00:45:54,842
but in pictures before
she was married.

653
00:45:54,945 --> 00:45:56,970
She looked like a film star.

654
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,174
It's true, Prof,
what he's saying.

655
00:46:00,284 --> 00:46:04,186
When she was 20 years old,
she took your breath away.

656
00:46:06,023 --> 00:46:09,652
She's less pretty now.
It's my dad's fault.

657
00:46:11,562 --> 00:46:13,223
Why do you say that?

658
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:16,128
He's always shouting at her,

659
00:46:16,233 --> 00:46:18,531
calling her names,
nagging at her...

660
00:46:18,635 --> 00:46:22,594
There are ups and
downs in all marriages.

661
00:46:22,706 --> 00:46:25,698
Did you call your wife names?

662
00:46:25,809 --> 00:46:28,744
No, it's not my style,

663
00:46:28,846 --> 00:46:33,044
although I expect I've
hurt her inadvertently.

664
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:36,642
I don't want my mum to
go on living like that.

665
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:38,914
She's always crying.

666
00:46:40,824 --> 00:46:43,725
Guito, come here.

667
00:46:47,331 --> 00:46:50,698
There's nothing to be
ashamed of, you know...

668
00:46:50,801 --> 00:46:55,397
Know how many people
I saw cry in the war?

669
00:46:55,505 --> 00:46:58,235
Big men with balls
like elephants...

670
00:46:58,342 --> 00:46:59,673
When night fell,

671
00:46:59,776 --> 00:47:03,337
they remembered their
families and cried.

672
00:47:03,447 --> 00:47:06,382
And then the next day,

673
00:47:06,483 --> 00:47:10,010
they were risking
their lives again...

674
00:47:11,889 --> 00:47:14,255
Who said men don't cry?

675
00:47:34,077 --> 00:47:35,601
Come here.

676
00:47:35,712 --> 00:47:37,873
Come and see this.

677
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:40,245
Look.

678
00:48:03,707 --> 00:48:05,641
The bastards are emptying
the water towers.

679
00:48:05,742 --> 00:48:07,232
Now that's just immoral,

680
00:48:07,344 --> 00:48:10,836
wasting water with so
much drought in the world.

681
00:48:10,948 --> 00:48:13,610
When were
the police ever moral?

682
00:48:13,717 --> 00:48:15,514
Don't overdo it, Pepe.

683
00:48:15,619 --> 00:48:18,349
I was just stating a fact.

684
00:48:18,455 --> 00:48:20,616
Have we got enough water?

685
00:48:20,724 --> 00:48:23,989
We've got enough
for two hours flight.

686
00:48:24,094 --> 00:48:27,222
-Planes don't take on water.
-It was a metaphor,

687
00:48:27,331 --> 00:48:30,494
for God's sake. Have you
forgotten what " metaphor" means?

688
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,661
Metaphor is when
I mean " stupid"

689
00:48:34,771 --> 00:48:37,069
and I say " Pepe" instead.

690
00:48:37,174 --> 00:48:40,632
You must give me the name
of the tablets you're taking.

691
00:48:43,013 --> 00:48:45,607
Wait, wait. Here.

692
00:48:49,052 --> 00:48:50,815
I can't remember the name.

693
00:48:50,921 --> 00:48:53,287
Sometimes I forget
the simplest things

694
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:58,225
and other times I remember in a
flash, like the metaphor thing.

695
00:48:58,328 --> 00:49:02,162
I don't know what it means
but Finadita used to say

696
00:49:02,265 --> 00:49:05,257
it when she taught at home.

697
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:06,734
I don't know.

698
00:49:06,837 --> 00:49:09,237
I told you... another fluke.

699
00:49:11,074 --> 00:49:12,905
I really got his back up.

700
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:13,840
Look, Pepe,

701
00:49:13,944 --> 00:49:16,674
whether by luck or the tablets,

702
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,510
the thing is he demolished you.

703
00:49:59,589 --> 00:50:02,456
Look, there's
a mobile T.V. unit.

704
00:50:05,529 --> 00:50:07,429
The banners!
Where are they?

705
00:50:07,531 --> 00:50:09,396
Shall I brake or go on?

706
00:50:09,499 --> 00:50:11,433
Slow down, but don't stop.

707
00:50:13,003 --> 00:50:15,369
There might be
some police there.

708
00:50:15,472 --> 00:50:20,705
Right! Four... three...
Damn it!

709
00:50:20,811 --> 00:50:21,869
Fucking hell...!

710
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:23,639
You kidnapped the boy.

711
00:50:23,747 --> 00:50:25,544
What? Is he a hostage?

712
00:50:25,649 --> 00:50:27,674
I'm a member of the group!

713
00:50:27,784 --> 00:50:29,046
Your mother's really upset.

714
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:31,120
Saying we kidnapped him is vile.

715
00:50:31,221 --> 00:50:32,153
He's a minor.

716
00:50:32,255 --> 00:50:34,553
His parents said
you just took him.

717
00:50:34,658 --> 00:50:36,353
What do you call that?

718
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,485
-You want to know?
-Yes.

719
00:50:38,595 --> 00:50:41,928
This is a set-up
arranged by that sepoy

720
00:50:42,032 --> 00:50:44,933
to get rich on the
country's heritage.

721
00:50:45,035 --> 00:50:47,128
That's what I call it.

722
00:50:47,237 --> 00:50:50,934
Do I look like a kidnapper?
Look at me!

723
00:50:51,041 --> 00:50:53,032
I don't know about that,

724
00:50:53,143 --> 00:50:55,543
but... they want the boy back.

725
00:51:04,421 --> 00:51:06,389
He's right.

726
00:51:16,967 --> 00:51:19,595
We're just common kidnappers.

727
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,058
Guito.

728
00:51:59,676 --> 00:52:01,507
You have to get off.

729
00:52:01,611 --> 00:52:05,138
No, Pepe,
don't listen to those fools.

730
00:52:05,248 --> 00:52:08,046
This is like in the war, Guito.

731
00:52:08,151 --> 00:52:10,346
It's the enemy's final offensive.

732
00:52:10,453 --> 00:52:12,421
You see?

733
00:52:12,522 --> 00:52:15,514
Like Franco's men
they're better equipped

734
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:18,355
and have the advantage.

735
00:52:18,461 --> 00:52:20,691
But the train has
to go to Brazil.

736
00:52:20,797 --> 00:52:23,459
Yes, that's a great idea
and I'll bear that in mind,

737
00:52:23,567 --> 00:52:28,834
but we shan't be
able to do it that way, Guito.

738
00:52:28,939 --> 00:52:33,603
You see, it's so
easy to stop a train.

739
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:36,975
They stopped my train
near Gijón, you remember

740
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:40,243
I told you that?

741
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:43,911
He who fights and runs away,
lives to fight another day,

742
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:47,820
you remember?

743
00:52:47,924 --> 00:52:51,087
The Professor said something
very important before.

744
00:52:51,194 --> 00:52:53,685
We have to win the
battle in the press.

745
00:52:53,797 --> 00:52:55,594
He's right.

746
00:52:55,699 --> 00:52:58,224
That's why you have to get off.

747
00:52:58,335 --> 00:53:02,465
The radio and T.V. stations
will be after you like

748
00:53:02,572 --> 00:53:04,938
you were a big star.

749
00:53:05,041 --> 00:53:07,066
You realize how
powerful that makes you?

750
00:53:07,177 --> 00:53:10,010
First I'll say that
I wasn't kidnapped.

751
00:53:10,113 --> 00:53:10,841
Fine, fine.

752
00:53:10,947 --> 00:53:14,508
And it's really important
you learn our slogan,

753
00:53:14,618 --> 00:53:17,280
so that when
they interview you

754
00:53:17,387 --> 00:53:21,414
you can mention it, slip
it into the conversation.

755
00:53:21,524 --> 00:53:25,085
It doesn't matter what
happens to us now.

756
00:53:25,195 --> 00:53:28,756
Even if they
stop us the main thing

757
00:53:28,865 --> 00:53:32,562
is for you to say
everything we couldn't.

758
00:53:44,948 --> 00:53:46,848
Now's the time, Pepe.

759
00:53:59,296 --> 00:54:01,423
It's been a pleasure.

760
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:06,230
Private Guito, our
fate is in your hands.

761
00:54:06,336 --> 00:54:09,271
We know you'll win us victory.

762
00:54:16,313 --> 00:54:18,042
My friend,

763
00:54:18,148 --> 00:54:20,810
off you go,
and take care, eh?

764
00:54:20,917 --> 00:54:22,782
You too.

765
00:54:28,158 --> 00:54:29,682
Look after the old men...

766
00:54:29,793 --> 00:54:31,727
I will.

767
00:54:59,989 --> 00:55:01,149
First on the scene,

768
00:55:01,257 --> 00:55:03,748
Montecarlo has good news
for the boy's parents.

769
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:04,656
Nobody kidnapped me.

770
00:55:04,761 --> 00:55:06,854
Then why
were you on the train?

771
00:55:06,963 --> 00:55:08,828
To stoke the boiler.

772
00:55:08,932 --> 00:55:11,400
-You could have got burned.
-No.

773
00:55:11,501 --> 00:55:14,061
I did what all
Uruguayans should do.

774
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:16,661
Make the
engine stay in Uruguay.

775
00:55:18,842 --> 00:55:22,608
How come your men can't
find the Professor's wife?

776
00:55:22,712 --> 00:55:24,077
In a few minutes...

777
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:26,341
More like 2,000 or 3,000 minutes.

778
00:55:26,449 --> 00:55:29,384
With all the fuss over the kid,

779
00:55:29,486 --> 00:55:33,286
we can't wait for
the water to run out.

780
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:34,880
There's a tunnel there,

781
00:55:34,991 --> 00:55:36,891
and it's on a bend.

782
00:55:36,993 --> 00:55:38,483
You get the idea?

783
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:43,192
Promise me the locomotive
won't be damaged.

784
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:45,699
I'm not an insurance company,

785
00:55:45,802 --> 00:55:50,671
but I think we have a
99% chance of success.

786
00:55:50,774 --> 00:55:54,039
And I don't want any martyrs.

787
00:55:54,144 --> 00:55:55,543
If anything happens to them

788
00:55:55,645 --> 00:55:58,273
I stand to lose a
lot more than you.

789
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,308
What are you looking for?

790
00:56:32,415 --> 00:56:34,474
I've forgotten the
name. I can't find it...

791
00:56:34,584 --> 00:56:38,645
Whose name?

792
00:56:38,755 --> 00:56:41,315
His.

793
00:56:41,424 --> 00:56:45,588
I can't remember
what he's called.

794
00:56:45,695 --> 00:56:48,027
José Avilés.

795
00:56:49,632 --> 00:56:52,260
What do we call him?

796
00:56:52,368 --> 00:56:54,495
Pepe.

797
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,581
Can you remember my name?

798
00:57:06,683 --> 00:57:08,742
Come on, say it.

799
00:57:08,852 --> 00:57:12,811
Antonio López,
alias " the Professor."

800
00:57:25,902 --> 00:57:28,234
You'll have to come
along with us, madam.

801
00:57:39,048 --> 00:57:41,312
Moraes, you go with Núñez.

802
00:57:41,417 --> 00:57:43,942
They're coming.
They mustn't see us.

803
00:57:56,366 --> 00:57:58,800
-Can we go any faster?
-We're at full speed.

804
00:57:58,902 --> 00:57:59,926
And there's a bend.

805
00:58:00,036 --> 00:58:01,731
Get into position!

806
00:58:38,741 --> 00:58:40,641
Fox One and Two ready.

807
00:59:16,346 --> 00:59:17,745
Hands up!

808
00:59:17,847 --> 00:59:19,576
-This is dynamite.
-Drop it!

809
00:59:19,682 --> 00:59:21,582
Come on, or we all go up.

810
00:59:21,684 --> 00:59:23,447
He's got a 27, he's got a 27!

811
00:59:25,755 --> 00:59:27,985
Abort mission!

812
00:59:43,306 --> 00:59:45,103
Get rid of that, Pepe.

813
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:47,699
Fucking hell! Get
rid of it, you damned fool!

814
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:49,903
-Since you ask so nicely.
-Yes...

815
00:59:59,422 --> 01:00:00,616
It's a miracle!

816
01:00:00,723 --> 01:00:02,452
A miracle!

817
01:00:02,558 --> 01:00:05,857
Professor, how could you
think I'd bring along

818
01:00:05,962 --> 01:00:08,453
real dynamite with
Guito on board?

819
01:00:08,564 --> 01:00:11,761
If we were at war,
I suppose I might.

820
01:00:11,868 --> 01:00:14,336
Did you see
those cops jump?

821
01:00:19,642 --> 01:00:21,872
Look, I'm not Guito
so stop talking rubbish.

822
01:00:21,978 --> 01:00:25,675
We all know you
weren't in any war.

823
01:00:25,782 --> 01:00:27,113
I was!

824
01:00:27,216 --> 01:00:29,184
You were a babe in arms.

825
01:00:29,285 --> 01:00:31,549
If you were
a teenager in 1936,

826
01:00:31,654 --> 01:00:34,589
you'd be at least
85 years old now.

827
01:00:34,691 --> 01:00:38,183
So what? The boy loves
listening to my stories.

828
01:00:38,294 --> 01:00:41,092
One day, Pepe, you'll
have to tell Guito

829
01:00:41,197 --> 01:00:44,291
the real hero was your
older brother and not you.

830
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,994
Out of all fairness
to your brother.

831
01:00:50,306 --> 01:00:53,070
And Guito doesn't love
you just for that.

832
01:00:57,747 --> 01:01:00,443
What a bastard you are!

833
01:01:26,776 --> 01:01:28,175
A 99% chance of success!

834
01:01:28,277 --> 01:01:30,575
You and your men
are a dead loss.

835
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,375
And if you weren't
so tight-fisted...

836
01:01:32,482 --> 01:01:35,474
-What do you mean?
-Our intelligence service

837
01:01:35,585 --> 01:01:39,919
tells me the insurance covers
the engine once aboard ship.

838
01:01:40,022 --> 01:01:43,014
Otherwise we could
stop it right now.

839
01:01:43,126 --> 01:01:44,354
Well they're wrong.

840
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:47,896
The engine's covered here
by a foreign company.

841
01:01:47,997 --> 01:01:50,557
It's not a question of money,

842
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:53,658
but prospects for
the future. Get it?

843
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:55,863
It doesn't look like it.

844
01:01:55,972 --> 01:01:57,200
I wouldn't go.

845
01:01:57,306 --> 01:02:01,538
With 100% efficiency my men are
bringing the Professor's wife.

846
01:02:03,713 --> 01:02:05,442
Kramer!

847
01:02:51,661 --> 01:02:53,526
Are you tired?

848
01:02:55,164 --> 01:02:56,597
Where are we?

849
01:02:56,699 --> 01:02:58,963
Coming to Chamberlain.

850
01:03:20,189 --> 01:03:22,157
The water just held out!

851
01:03:22,258 --> 01:03:24,488
My hand's falling off.

852
01:05:08,698 --> 01:05:10,689
Mincho's cantina.

853
01:06:19,035 --> 01:06:21,435
Look, that's me.

854
01:06:31,347 --> 01:06:34,942
The strike of '49

855
01:06:35,051 --> 01:06:38,179
A grand strike.

856
01:06:38,287 --> 01:06:40,687
They sent battering rams.

857
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:42,621
Poor wretches,

858
01:06:42,725 --> 01:06:45,319
we kicked their backsides.

859
01:06:48,197 --> 01:06:51,030
Where can we get water here?

860
01:07:12,688 --> 01:07:15,179
You know who I am?

861
01:07:16,358 --> 01:07:18,690
I'm the Professor.

862
01:07:21,297 --> 01:07:23,697
And he's Pepe.

863
01:07:27,436 --> 01:07:29,529
I don't know...

864
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:33,865
I'm the Professor,

865
01:07:33,976 --> 01:07:36,376
and he's Pepe.

866
01:07:38,948 --> 01:07:41,143
What's my name?

867
01:07:43,085 --> 01:07:45,781
Dante.

868
01:07:45,888 --> 01:07:49,051
Dante Minetti.

869
01:07:55,931 --> 01:07:58,297
Don't worry, you're
among friends.

870
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,958
The Professor,

871
01:08:00,069 --> 01:08:02,264
Pepe,

872
01:08:02,371 --> 01:08:04,202
and Dante...

873
01:08:04,306 --> 01:08:06,672
You're Dante, remember?

874
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:12,676
-Say it, " I'm Dante."
-What am I doing here?

875
01:08:14,817 --> 01:08:16,785
We were riding
with the Professor

876
01:08:16,886 --> 01:08:18,979
and the boy, Guito, on
the engine, remember?

877
01:08:19,088 --> 01:08:21,682
No. I want to go...

878
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:23,815
You want to go?

879
01:08:23,926 --> 01:08:27,020
I'm hungry.

880
01:08:27,129 --> 01:08:32,863
What would you like?

881
01:08:32,968 --> 01:08:36,836
Noodles and pesto.

882
01:08:36,939 --> 01:08:41,171
We can manage that.

883
01:08:41,277 --> 01:08:43,404
Come on,

884
01:08:43,512 --> 01:08:46,777
let's go and have some
noodles and pesto.

885
01:09:03,866 --> 01:09:05,800
What are we going to do?

886
01:09:05,901 --> 01:09:07,892
He should see a doctor.

887
01:09:08,003 --> 01:09:09,868
I don't think
much can be done.

888
01:09:09,972 --> 01:09:11,769
Nothing at all.

889
01:09:11,874 --> 01:09:14,342
The same thing
happened to my mother.

890
01:09:20,716 --> 01:09:22,047
So now what?

891
01:09:22,151 --> 01:09:23,482
It's okay, we're here to help.

892
01:09:26,689 --> 01:09:28,714
We saw you pass.

893
01:09:28,824 --> 01:09:30,052
Thanks.

894
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:31,490
Thanks very much.

895
01:09:31,594 --> 01:09:34,062
Can we take on
water around here?

896
01:09:34,163 --> 01:09:35,755
Of course, come with us.

897
01:09:35,864 --> 01:09:38,389
Come with us, please.

898
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,127
Right.

899
01:10:06,528 --> 01:10:09,793
This is the geriatrics
department.

900
01:10:09,898 --> 01:10:13,459
Tell them to call his son.

901
01:10:13,569 --> 01:10:15,628
-Give me a hand, Prof.
-Hey.

902
01:10:15,738 --> 01:10:19,799
Still feel like
noodles and pesto?

903
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:23,573
Look, you see this gentleman?

904
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:27,012
His wife makes the best
pesto for miles around.

905
01:10:27,116 --> 01:10:30,984
Yes, she's a great pesto expert.

906
01:10:31,086 --> 01:10:34,453
Go with them, eat all
the noodles you want,

907
01:10:34,556 --> 01:10:37,992
and Pepe and I will
come back for you.

908
01:10:38,093 --> 01:10:39,856
Come on then.

909
01:11:29,611 --> 01:11:31,841
Promise me something.

910
01:11:31,947 --> 01:11:34,916
What?

911
01:11:35,017 --> 01:11:41,115
If I ever get like that,
please push me under a bus.

912
01:11:41,223 --> 01:11:44,090
But he's happier
than he ever was.

913
01:11:44,193 --> 01:11:48,926
Yes, but it's not him any
more, Professor.

914
01:11:49,031 --> 01:11:52,694
We're the sum of
our experiences.

915
01:11:52,801 --> 01:11:57,534
Yes, but if all you experience
is suffering, what's the point?

916
01:11:57,639 --> 01:12:00,631
What's up with you?
What are you saying?

917
01:12:27,403 --> 01:12:29,098
I see it.

918
01:12:29,204 --> 01:12:31,138
Did they take on water?

919
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,764
Affirmative.

920
01:12:32,875 --> 01:12:34,240
Damn it!

921
01:12:34,343 --> 01:12:35,970
We're on our way,
notify all units.

922
01:12:56,432 --> 01:12:58,332
Professor!

923
01:13:18,854 --> 01:13:20,685
Listen to me, you bastard!

924
01:13:20,789 --> 01:13:25,886
Antonio, it's me.

925
01:13:25,994 --> 01:13:27,962
Micaela?

926
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:31,032
What are you doing with him?

927
01:13:31,133 --> 01:13:33,761
I wanted to hear your voice.

928
01:13:33,869 --> 01:13:36,360
You didn't tell
me about the doctor.

929
01:13:36,472 --> 01:13:38,872
I left you a letter, Micaela.

930
01:13:38,974 --> 01:13:41,704
About very important
things for me...

931
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:43,334
It's you who's important.

932
01:13:43,445 --> 01:13:45,345
I don't want to lose you.

933
01:13:45,447 --> 01:13:51,977
And I don't want to end
up like a vegetable.

934
01:13:52,087 --> 01:13:54,851
Professor López.

935
01:13:54,957 --> 01:13:57,755
I expect you've heard
of the famous

936
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:59,987
-Mayo clinic in America?
-So?

937
01:14:00,095 --> 01:14:03,997
It specializes in the
treatment you need.

938
01:14:04,099 --> 01:14:07,660
You could be flying there
with your wife tomorrow...

939
01:14:07,769 --> 01:14:09,498
Now you listen here.

940
01:14:09,605 --> 01:14:11,971
If I wanted an operation
I'd go to Montevideo.

941
01:14:12,074 --> 01:14:14,508
I don't want any surgeon
talking foreign to me.

942
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:15,872
Understand?

943
01:14:15,978 --> 01:14:18,776
Science knows no
languages, just results.

944
01:14:18,881 --> 01:14:20,508
And your wife's already told me

945
01:14:20,616 --> 01:14:25,815
she wants you to go where
results are guaranteed.

946
01:14:25,921 --> 01:14:28,321
Antonio,

947
01:14:28,423 --> 01:14:32,291
I'll always be there.

948
01:14:32,394 --> 01:14:34,521
I love you, my darling!

949
01:14:38,433 --> 01:14:40,094
I love you.

950
01:14:54,082 --> 01:14:55,879
When this is all over,

951
01:14:55,984 --> 01:14:59,044
I'll kick you into the
operating room if necessary.

952
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:08,189
All under control, sir. They
won't leave the country.

953
01:15:08,297 --> 01:15:10,094
Fine.

954
01:15:10,198 --> 01:15:12,189
Divert them.

955
01:15:41,496 --> 01:15:43,327
Fucking bastards!

956
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:45,957
What is it?

957
01:15:47,803 --> 01:15:49,668
We're going into a siding.

958
01:16:09,358 --> 01:16:11,883
You'll have to get off.

959
01:16:11,994 --> 01:16:14,554
I'm staying on.

960
01:19:07,736 --> 01:19:10,102
You're useless with the brakes.

961
01:19:10,205 --> 01:19:13,800
When we've stolen 2 or 3 more,
you'll see how useless I am.

962
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:17,274
You're under arrest,

963
01:19:17,379 --> 01:19:21,907
in accordance with Articles 178
and 192, and 306, Section One.

964
01:19:22,017 --> 01:19:24,713
Come along with us.

965
01:19:38,633 --> 01:19:40,658
Techera, take the
lady to the van.

966
01:19:50,579 --> 01:19:52,513
Well, did we stop them or not?

967
01:19:52,614 --> 01:19:54,104
Your work's not over.

968
01:19:54,216 --> 01:19:58,152
Clear the line. The engine
goes back to Montevideo.

969
01:19:58,253 --> 01:19:59,982
That's your problem.

970
01:20:00,088 --> 01:20:02,283
It's Montevideo for the prisoners.

971
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:03,982
Listen, Ponce...

972
01:20:04,092 --> 01:20:04,922
Ponce!
