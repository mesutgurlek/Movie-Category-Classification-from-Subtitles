1
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,402
This is the Denver
& Rio Grande Western,

2
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:45,405
A modern railroad
whose shining steel rails

3
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,407
Wind through Colorado
and Utah...

4
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,677
Across
the continental divide...

5
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,411
Linking Denver and pueblo

6
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,814
With salt lake city
and ogden...

7
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,817
Rocky Mountain empire
of vast agricultural,

8
00:01:56,916 --> 00:02:00,120
Mining, industrial,
and recreational resources.

9
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,423
The Denver & Rio Grande
Western flourishes today

10
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,425
Because of
the herculean struggles

11
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,328
Of its builder
and first president,

12
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:08,828
General William j. Palmer,

13
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:12,700
As depicted in the story
we're about to unfold...

14
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,435
A saga of the frontier,

15
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:17,438
An epic of pioneer
Western railroad builders

16
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:20,106
And their fight
for the route

17
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,176
Through the royal gorge.

18
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,765
Left. Left a little.

19
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,599
A little more.

20
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:49,837
Now right a little.

21
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:52,138
A little to the right.

22
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,308
That's fine.
Hold it.

23
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,435
Hey!

24
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,805
There's a surveying
party coming down

25
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,406
Out of the gorge.

26
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:27,173
What?

27
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:28,576
They're
driving stakes

28
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,177
For the canyon city
and San Juan.

29
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:33,012
Their lines
are South of here.

30
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:36,683
I recognized McCabe,
the boss contractor
for the canyon city.

31
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:39,586
This is d & rg property.
They can't do it.

32
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:43,022
I'll see what this is about.
Stay with the men.

33
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:44,190
You might need help.

34
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:46,459
Less likely
if I go alone.

35
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:52,164
Well, like we
was expecting.

36
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,802
Here he comes...
general Palmer's
little hero.

37
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:58,272
We was here first,
and we're going to stick.

38
00:03:58,372 --> 00:03:59,639
Captain Jim vesser.

39
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,610
Yeah. Saved
the general's life
at chickamauga,

40
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,613
So that makes him
a railroad
construction boss.

41
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,448
General Palmer knows
he's a good
engineer, too.

42
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,217
He'll listen
to reason.

43
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:11,585
We got our rights,

44
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,953
And no tin soldier's
going to mess them up.

45
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:17,491
McCabe, we soldiered
in the same army.
I know him.

46
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,127
If you want me
to finish
this survey,

47
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,595
Let me do
the talking.

48
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:36,576
Hello, Jim.

49
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,546
They said in Denver
you'd be up here.

50
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,147
I haven't seen you
since the big fuss.

51
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,616
Hello, Nelson.
You in charge here?

52
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:44,418
Under McCabe.

53
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,554
McCabe, vesser.

54
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,525
You're a little
off your survey,
aren't you?

55
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,226
Why, no.

56
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:56,564
Your route's South
over the silverton pass.

57
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,800
We looked the pass over
and came down through here.

58
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,300
This way's shorter.

59
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,570
There's no room
for two roadbeds.

60
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:05,439
That's how it looked
to me.

61
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:08,475
We have a franchise
from the legislature

62
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:09,677
To go through here.

63
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:11,944
So's the canyon city
and San Juan.

64
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,414
Legislatures do
some funny things
sometimes.

65
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,884
We've been surveying
for three weeks.

66
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,185
And so have we.

67
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:19,586
Don't get
hotheaded, Jim.

68
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,954
It's for the courts
to decide.

69
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:25,224
Nothing says
I have to wait
for any courts.

70
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,459
We're going through.

71
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,195
Uh-uh. Not along
our stakes.

72
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,498
We'll throw them
in the river.

73
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:33,467
You throw one stake
in the river,

74
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,003
I'll throw you in
right after it.

75
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:37,871
Don't do that, Jim.

76
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:57,991
If that's the way
you want it, Jim.

77
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,096
Now you're talking
my language.

78
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,792
Come on, men.
We've got to stop them.

79
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,596
(Gunshots)

80
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,105
(Gunshot)

81
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,960
Jim. Jim!

82
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:13,667
Nelson.

83
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:18,137
Why... Why, Jim?

84
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,712
Jim, what...
What happened?

85
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,182
He... He threw in a gun.

86
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,184
You... You pulled
that gun.

87
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:33,521
You knocked it out
of my hand.

88
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:35,523
That's right.
I saw it.

89
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:38,626
McCabe was trying
to stop the fight.

90
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:43,130
He clipped me
pretty hard.

91
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,132
I guess
I was groggy.

92
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:47,968
I...I didn't mean
to shoot him.

93
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:51,337
Well, it...
It must have been
an accident.

94
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:54,141
Yeah, call it
an accident.

95
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:56,009
An accident
on purpose.

96
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:00,480
Get out
of this country.

97
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,149
He was trying
to tell you

98
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,553
It was for the courts
to decide.

99
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,821
But you don't want it
that way.

100
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,190
You started a fight,
and you killed him.

101
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:16,195
Well, what's good enough
for you is good enough
for us.

102
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:17,565
If it's killing you want,

103
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:21,602
You stay on the job
and that's how it'll be.

104
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,636
It's up to you.

105
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,875
Pick him up, men.
Take him back to camp.

106
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,664
Come on, Jim.

107
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,646
I guess he's ready,
sheriff.

108
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,715
No hurry, gil.

109
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,904
Jim, you haven't
eaten anything.

110
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:35,507
How about
some hot coffee
before you go?

111
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,244
No, thanks.

112
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:40,247
Oh, come on, Jim.
It's no use.

113
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:41,682
It wasn't
your fault.

114
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:42,750
Nelson's dead.

115
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,951
Well, nobody's
blaming you.

116
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,886
He's still dead.

117
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:53,661
You saw a lot of men
killed in the war.

118
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,027
Killed some
yourself.

119
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:58,265
This is building
a railroad, gil,
not war.

120
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:00,600
No place here
for killing.

121
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:25,726
Hello, Jim.

122
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:29,162
Have a drink.

123
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:32,598
You've been swimming in
this stuff for a week.

124
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,567
When are you
going to Chuck it
and come back?

125
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,771
I don't know.
Maybe never.

126
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,841
That's ridiculous.
You were cleared
by the court.

127
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,776
Pull yourself together.

128
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,476
We're way behind,
and you've got
a job to do.

129
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:46,478
I'm through.

130
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:49,783
Through?
What do you mean?

131
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,351
The job's yours.

132
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,085
Yeah, but, Jim,
we're a team.

133
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,486
I plan, you build.

134
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:55,955
What do you suppose
would happen

135
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,557
If I tried to boss
300 tough
construction workers?

136
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,260
That's right.
They'd laugh in my face.

137
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,563
If you can plan
a railroad,
you can build it.

138
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,199
All right, Jim.

139
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,599
I didn't want to say it,

140
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,070
But that's exactly
what McCabe wants.

141
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,705
He's got a record
a mile long.

142
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:15,107
Every job he handled
wound up with violence,

143
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,810
And you're playing
right into his hands.

144
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:20,512
McCabe doesn't matter.
Give d & rg a chance.

145
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:23,350
If I come back,
it'll be a battle.

146
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,718
Sure, and we'll win.

147
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,085
No. Nobody will win it.

148
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,521
A lot of men
will get hurt
for no good reason.

149
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:32,158
Build your railroad
as fast as you can...

150
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,460
Without fighting.

151
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,706
(Train whistle)

152
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,835
(Train whistle)

153
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:27,179
We have had more
than our fair share
of bad luck,

154
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,784
But hazards are to be expected
in work of this kind.

155
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,184
True.
Natural hazards, yes.

156
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,788
General Palmer,
I've planned this work

157
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,791
About as well as any man
could possibly plan it.

158
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:40,192
Now, don't take
this personally, harkness.

159
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:43,797
Linda, may I have that list
of accidents and delays?

160
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,198
I've got a board
of directors to face.

161
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,700
They want answers
for their money.

162
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:50,804
That's why I'm
making this trip.

163
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:53,205
Now, look at this...
"bridge collapsed,

164
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,207
Loose rail, derailment,
faulty coupling."

165
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:58,411
Looks like nature
had plenty of help.

166
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,813
There has been
carelessness.

167
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:02,415
I had to get rid
of several foremen.

168
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,284
Mm-hmm.
This time last month,

169
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:08,121
How far were we ahead
of the canyon city?

170
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:08,921
5 Miles.

171
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,489
2 1/2 Miles now.

172
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,827
Another 30 days like that
and we'll be neck and neck.

173
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,129
This has been
going on for months,

174
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,131
And we've got
to stop it.

175
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,101
Frankly, general,
I'm just about stumped.

176
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,136
I've spent days and nights
figuring against
every possibility.

177
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:27,374
But as you know,
I map out railroads.

178
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,740
I do the engineering.

179
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,142
I know
absolutely nothing

180
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,412
About handling
a construction crew.

181
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,180
That was
Jim vesser's job.

182
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,749
I've just got to admit
that I'm lost
without vesser.

183
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:39,751
Why did vesser
really quit?

184
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:43,323
Why? For the good
of the d & rg.

185
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:46,426
Vesser ran away
because he lost
his nerve.

186
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:48,528
Why, that's a lie.

187
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:49,930
He started
that fight,

188
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,598
And he murdered
Bob Nelson.

189
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,665
He was cleared
in the courts.

190
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:55,035
Now, wait a minute.

191
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,169
I know captain vesser
very well.

192
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,172
Don't talk nonsense
about him losing his nerve.

193
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,041
What's this about?
You know him?

194
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:03,775
No, I don't.
It's just...

195
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:07,446
I have
reason to know

196
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,982
That the true facts
didn't come out
at the inquest.

197
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,985
People like vesser
seem to be beyond
the law.

198
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,520
If he didn't lose
his nerve,

199
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,189
Then his conscience
bothers him.

200
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:19,191
Well, Linda, I'd say
it's a good idea

201
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,395
For captain vesser
to keep out of your way.

202
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,864
I'd like
to meet him.

203
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:19,286
(Train whistle)

204
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,344
(Train whistle)

205
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,620
This ought to do it.

206
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:12,571
Now?

207
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:18,377
No, wait. Wait till
it's a little closer.

208
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,213
All right, now.

209
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,637
Landslide!

210
00:16:44,736 --> 00:16:46,073
Landslide!

211
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,144
Jump! Jump!

212
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,088
(Brakes squeal)

213
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,377
Go see
what happened.

214
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,779
I'm all right.

215
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:29,048
Take care of him.

216
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:49,401
Where's the engineer?

217
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,104
He jumped.

218
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:53,740
Get some shovels
and start digging!

219
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,541
Lively now!

220
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:57,777
The rest of you men,
come with me.

221
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,157
Anybody hurt?

222
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,757
The engineer
jumped.

223
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,125
The fireman's
all right.

224
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,761
Get the tools,
clear that away.
You, too.

225
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:16,762
Hello, gil!

226
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,765
Jim! It's good
to see you,

227
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,532
Even in a mess
like this.

228
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,470
That's all
that's been happening
since you left.

229
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,538
You were right
about McCabe.
This is his work.

230
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:29,176
Canyon city
doesn't realize
how he's operating.

231
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,178
They're working
through the courts.

232
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,213
They got an injunction
against you.

233
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:34,214
An injunction?

234
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:35,748
It stops you cold.

235
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:37,583
Are you coming back
with us?

236
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:38,785
Yeah.

237
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,787
What made you change
your mind?

238
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:42,189
I quit
to avoid bloodshed.

239
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,055
You got
a dead engineer now.

240
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:46,057
He's not the first
McCabe victim.

241
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:47,459
He won't be
the last.

242
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,060
McCabe's got to
be handled.

243
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,397
You stick with
the blueprints.

244
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,431
I'll handle
the trouble.

245
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,369
Let's go and see
the general.

246
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,004
Oh,
here he is now.

247
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,140
No, wait a minute.
Come here.

248
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,542
I want to look
the camp over

249
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,545
Before anyone
knows I'm here.

250
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,014
Don't tell the general
about the injunction.

251
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,216
Fine.

252
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,683
I'll check with
you both tonight.

253
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:21,661
How bad is it?

254
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,264
Well, I'm afraid
we've lost our engineer.

255
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,265
Anybody else?

256
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,366
Let's go and see.

257
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,376
Aah!

258
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,113
Thank you.

259
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:43,716
Better stay
in the car.

260
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,651
It's rocky down here.

261
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,154
Well, suit yourself.

262
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:50,622
I will.

263
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:12,811
We've been running trains
through this cut
for weeks now.

264
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,480
This is not
an accident.

265
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:16,482
It's obviously
the work of McCabe,

266
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,117
And we must do
something to stop it.

267
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,486
A few minutes ago,

268
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:22,488
You thought
these things were caused

269
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,856
By the carelessness
of our own workmen.

270
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:28,461
As a matter of fact,
I've changed my way
of thinking.

271
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,096
The engineer
highballing
this train

272
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:31,497
Should have been
driving mules.

273
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:34,132
If I had been at
the throttle...

274
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,868
You an engineer?

275
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,136
I am.

276
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,872
Nine years on
the allegheny run

277
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:41,139
For the New York
central.

278
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,309
Moynahan's the name.

279
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,410
When we get
this mess cleared,

280
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,412
Can you run us
into railhead?

281
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:47,880
If I can't,
it can't be done.

282
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:48,980
You're hired.

283
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,116
Who, might I ask,
is hiring me?

284
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,952
That's general Palmer.

285
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:56,255
General Palmer!

286
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,525
Well...

287
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,903
You're a fireman?

288
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,305
That I am.

289
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,806
Get firing.

290
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:17,344
Get out
the portable telegraph

291
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,346
And cut
into the wires.

292
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,314
Have railhead send
men on handcars.

293
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:25,318
We should be able
to clear this
in a couple hours.

294
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,354
Temporarily, at least.

295
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:36,762
(Train whistle)

296
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,192
Well, what does it
look like?

297
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:09,060
I've never seen
an injunction before.

298
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:10,596
Uh-uh.

299
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:12,832
I'll hold it.
You look.

300
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:14,200
Well, what's it for?

301
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,968
Is it against the law
to build a railroad?

302
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:20,707
No, but you see...
well, it's all very
complicated.

303
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,675
Ed Johnson,
do you mean to tell me

304
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:27,847
That you're actually
going to give that thing
to general Palmer?

305
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:28,980
Now, do you?

306
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:33,420
Jane, sometimes
I wish I stayed
a cowboy...

307
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:35,754
But I got to
serve it.

308
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,990
If I don't,
somebody else will.

309
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:39,324
Well, thanks.

310
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:40,927
Just a minute.

311
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,293
That'll be 10 cents.

312
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:44,663
10 cents
for a cup of coffee?

313
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:47,634
For officers of the law,
coffee's on the house.

314
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,769
For them that does
the canyon city
dirty work,

315
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,004
It's double.

316
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,749
Howdy!
Howdy!

317
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:06,152
Good to see you
back here again.

318
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:10,589
Come on!

319
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,127
Ed, why, hi.
What are you doing
up here?

320
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,528
Say,
how's your poker?

321
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:18,898
You still drawing to
an inside straight?

322
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:22,769
No, but I think
they dealt you
out of this hand.

323
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,169
I got bad news.

324
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,772
Well, let's have it.

325
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:26,573
Sorry, general.

326
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:29,174
If they give it to you,

327
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:31,610
You got to serve it.

328
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:36,549
Let's go to my tent,
and we'll talk it over.

329
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:38,518
We'll fight them
to a finish.

330
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:41,688
They've used every
unfair and dirty way
to beat us.

331
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:45,256
It don't mean
that I like it,
Mr. harkness.

332
00:23:45,356 --> 00:23:47,893
General, will you
be needing me?

333
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:50,029
Not till later, no.

334
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,967
Yoo-hoo,
Mr. moynahan!

335
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:58,037
Oh, i... i thought...

336
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:01,107
Yoo-hoo!

337
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:01,440
Mr. moynahan!

338
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,743
(Whistle blows)

339
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,315
Oh!

340
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,751
Come out of there, you.

341
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,218
Hello, darling.

342
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,653
What are you doing
up there?

343
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:16,689
Blowing off
a bit of steam.

344
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,257
I'm the new engineer.

345
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:19,658
You've been
drinking.

346
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,128
Not a drop,
so help me.

347
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:25,064
It was all the doings
of general Palmer himself.

348
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:28,667
I knew he'd recognize
a good man when he saw one.

349
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:30,703
Wasn't that sweet
of the general?

350
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,705
I knew it all the time.

351
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,906
I saw it in the cards.

352
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:36,307
Did you see this?

353
00:24:36,407 --> 00:24:38,144
I brought you something.

354
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,081
Oh, Mr. moynahan.

355
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:47,285
What is it?

356
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:49,320
A present for you,
darling.

357
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,289
All the way from Denver.

358
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:52,692
It's big,
isn't it?

359
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,762
And the only one like it
in camp.

360
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,971
It's lovely,
isn't it?

361
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:09,541
And a washboard, too.

362
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:57,590
That, uh, girl is here.

363
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,759
All right. Ahem.

364
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:10,235
Hello.

365
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,939
How are you,
Johnny buff?

366
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,541
We were expecting you.
We saw the train.

367
00:26:15,642 --> 00:26:17,175
Kind of late,
weren't you?

368
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:18,177
There was a landslide.

369
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,178
No...

370
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,545
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

371
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:23,514
Hey, the train
had a little accident.

372
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,017
You shut up.
Any trace
of vesser?

373
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:29,255
Not yet.
I've tried for months
to locate him.

374
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:31,022
He'll come back.
They always do.

375
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:32,858
He's got
railroading
in his blood.

376
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,861
I was afraid
you might forget.

377
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,229
When I get my hands
on vesser,

378
00:26:37,328 --> 00:26:40,667
I'll give him
the same chance
he gave your brother

379
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,269
When he shot him
in the back.

380
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:44,836
I believe you.

381
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,571
Just let me know
about everything.

382
00:26:46,673 --> 00:26:48,174
Yeah, keep us
informed.

383
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:49,574
What about
the injunction?

384
00:26:49,676 --> 00:26:52,543
The sheriff served it
when we arrived.

385
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:54,913
I'd sure like
to have seen
Palmer's face.

386
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,817
How's he expect
to keep a crew
together now,

387
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,285
Especially
with no pay?

388
00:26:59,385 --> 00:27:00,687
Did he bring
the payroll?

389
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:01,620
General Palmer's
making this trip

390
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,691
To check on the work
and the accidents.

391
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,693
Pay for the men
don't count?

392
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,560
They'll get it
on the weekend trip.

393
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:10,963
You talk too much.

394
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:14,733
Well, she don't,
unless you keep
after her.

395
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,103
I have no intention
of betraying
any confidences

396
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:19,104
About general Palmer's
private business.

397
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:22,340
He's been very fair
and kind to me.

398
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:23,710
I'm only interested

399
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,713
In seeing that the man
that shot my brother

400
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:28,681
Gets the punishment
he deserves.

401
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,950
To think of him
walking around
scot-free...

402
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,051
You won't have to worry...

403
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:33,920
Shut up, you.

404
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,322
I'll take care
of vesser.

405
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:38,190
Thanks.

406
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,059
Goodbye.

407
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:45,865
Take it easy, especially
in those accidents.

408
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:52,238
What are you
trying to do,
make her suspicious?

409
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:53,604
No, just mad.

410
00:27:53,706 --> 00:27:55,307
It's the only way
to find out something.

411
00:27:55,406 --> 00:27:56,843
I'm running
this job.

412
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:58,910
Hey, this is
Johnny buff, remember?

413
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,680
I was there
when vesser shot Nelson.

414
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,085
Keep remembering it
that way.

415
00:28:08,755 --> 00:28:11,657
As a matter
of principle, you're
probably right,

416
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:15,427
Although
there's very little
actual evidence.

417
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:18,998
I'll give
the full report
to my lawyers.

418
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:21,632
General,
we've got to fight
fire with fire.

419
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:23,634
If McCabe can use
such tactics,

420
00:28:23,736 --> 00:28:26,272
It's up to us
to go back...

421
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:27,638
With fire, huh?

422
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,576
Coming from you, harkness,
it rather astounds me.

423
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,245
You were saying
we should come right back

424
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,046
And what?
Be specific.

425
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:36,282
Well, uh...

426
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:39,050
How are you,
general?

427
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,386
Well...

428
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:42,221
How long
has he been here?

429
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,824
He was on the train
this afternoon.

430
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:46,826
That explains
that fire-eating talk.

431
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:49,996
Jim, it's good
to see you. Sit down.

432
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:52,865
Oh, excuse me.

433
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:56,101
Jim here is quite
an admirer of yours.

434
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,135
Miss Prescott...

435
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:00,138
I'm afraid we've
already met... in a way.

436
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:03,709
You see, he saved me
from a bad fall today.

437
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,676
If he hadn't been there

438
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:07,478
At exactly
the right time...

439
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:11,717
Everybody but me
knew Jim vesser
was on that train.

440
00:29:11,818 --> 00:29:13,119
Let's make
it official.

441
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:16,655
Here's the man
you said you'd like to meet,

442
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,924
Captain Jim vesser,

443
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:20,927
This is my secretary
miss Linda Prescott.

444
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:23,930
It was a pleasure
to have been there

445
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:26,397
At exactly
the right time.

446
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:28,900
Sit down, Jim.

447
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,073
Well, you're back.

448
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:36,007
That's good.

449
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,608
Gil's still
running the job.

450
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:39,710
I'm digging up
the reasons for the trouble.

451
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:42,713
We thought that
would be the best way.

452
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:45,216
What have you
unearthed so far?

453
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:46,318
A lot of unrest,

454
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:48,686
But nothing
you could put
your fingers on.

455
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,122
Now the agitators
are out
telling the men

456
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:53,224
They won't get
their back pay.

457
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:56,194
That's so close
to the truth it's
not comfortable.

458
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:59,730
It'll be difficult
to get the board
to grant advances

459
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:01,367
With us
at a standstill.

460
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:02,834
What are your plans?

461
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:07,272
These leaders
are paid by McCabe
to stir up our men.

462
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:11,509
We ought to run them
out of camp on a pole.

463
00:30:15,746 --> 00:30:19,886
Well, we'll, uh,
have to think that
over very carefully.

464
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:23,154
Linda, you disagree,
evidently.

465
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:26,192
How does captain
vesser's suggestion
strike you?

466
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:29,195
What he proposes
doesn't surprise me a bit.

467
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:32,198
It's exactly what
I'd expect him to think.

468
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:35,166
If what he says
about these men is true,

469
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,135
Then the sheriff
should arrest them.

470
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:38,636
Jim, I think
she's right.

471
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:41,840
Ask her
her opinion of all
the accidents you've had.

472
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:43,842
There are men
like yourself

473
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:45,776
That hold themselves
above the law

474
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:47,812
And take it
into their own hands

475
00:30:47,914 --> 00:30:49,147
Without proof.

476
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:51,450
They're more guilty
than the ones they accuse.

477
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,719
Anyone has the right
to defend their property
against thieves.

478
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,355
Not outside the law!

479
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:58,156
Thank you, Linda.

480
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:01,860
You stated
that as clearly
as a Denver lawyer.

481
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,796
The injunction
must be based
on false claims.

482
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:08,434
If you get the train
ready in the morning,

483
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,202
We'll work to vacate it

484
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:13,872
As soon as I get
back to Denver.

485
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,443
Good night, general.

486
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,444
Good night, men.

487
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:19,445
Jim.

488
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:20,879
Good night.

489
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,093
Miss Prescott.

490
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:37,029
I'm afraid
I don't understand.

491
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:40,265
Have I said something
to offend you?

492
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,667
No.

493
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:44,570
General Palmer seems
to have a certain
confidence in you.

494
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:47,372
As long as
I'm working for him,

495
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:49,441
I'll force myself
to be civil to you.

496
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:50,476
Wait a minute.

497
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,810
You sound as if
it's something personal.

498
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,180
I don't even know you.

499
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,713
What have
I done to you?

500
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:57,549
Ask yourself
what you've done.

501
00:31:57,648 --> 00:31:58,951
What are you
talking about?

502
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:01,920
Ask yourself why
you ran from the d & rg

503
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,922
In the first place.

504
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:22,808
You must have been
awfully busy
while I was away.

505
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:24,209
You'll never know
how busy.

506
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,446
I never had time
to wash anything.

507
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:29,147
Yes. I guessed as much.

508
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,216
Little did I think
I'd be the first

509
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:33,218
To break in
me present to you.

510
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:35,654
I could have
told you that.

511
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:44,596
Well, either way
we're in for it.

512
00:32:44,695 --> 00:32:47,198
We can't afford
to pay them if
they don't work,

513
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,800
And we can't fire them
because we'd never
get them back

514
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,870
After the
injunction's lifted.

515
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:53,871
There's another way.

516
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,474
Hey! All you men!

517
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:56,841
Over by the saloon.

518
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,843
We want
to talk to you.

519
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:01,013
Wait, Jim.
We can't defy the courts.

520
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:01,980
So they'll fine us.

521
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,550
How much is it
costing not to work?

522
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,084
This is pioneer country.

523
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:08,919
The cc & sj
can take advantage
of their smart lawyers

524
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:10,921
And stretch out this
injunction indefinitely.

525
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,190
Meanwhile,
McCabe lays track.

526
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:13,792
Let Palmer handle
the law.

527
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:15,794
We're getting back
on the job.

528
00:33:15,894 --> 00:33:17,796
You handle this.
You're the boss.

529
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:19,665
I'll string along
in case.

530
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:30,641
All right, men.

531
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,443
We're going
back to work.

532
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:35,047
Come on.
Let's build a railroad.

533
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:37,516
You can't give orders
in my place.

534
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:39,917
I'm talking to men from
the Denver-Rio Grande.

535
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,187
That's all you got here.

536
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:43,421
Talk to them
on railroad property.

537
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:44,590
I own this place.

538
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,425
Your tent's on
Denver & Rio Grande property.

539
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,493
No, it's not.

540
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:50,961
The front's 10 feet
off the right-of-way.

541
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:54,066
How about our pay?

542
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,002
Pay was 10 days ago.

543
00:33:58,104 --> 00:34:00,371
You'll get your pay
soon enough.

544
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:03,175
There's talk the
Denver & Rio Grande
is busted.

545
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:05,244
We'll get it
before we start
back to work.

546
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:06,912
How about it, boys?

547
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,080
Wait a minute.

548
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,514
Who put you
up to this?

549
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:11,617
Nobody put us up
to anything,
have they?

550
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,784
No!
No!
No!

551
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,585
Well, you're fired.

552
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:16,221
Who are you
to fire me?

553
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:17,688
You didn't hire me.

554
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:19,091
No, but I did.

555
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,092
And you're fired.

556
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:22,428
You heard him.
Clear out.

557
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,866
Get out of here!

558
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,002
Nobody's breaking up
my place!

559
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,405
Get out of here.

560
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:10,842
Get out of here.
All of you! Get out!

561
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,578
Get out of here.

562
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,192
I think
they'll work now.

563
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:29,661
All right, men.
Back on the job.

564
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,017
All right, men!
Back to work.

565
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:54,619
Everyone down here.

566
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,020
Get your tools!

567
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,689
Start working.

568
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:02,126
Ready, pull.

569
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,863
Ready, lift.

570
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:07,199
Ready, go.

571
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,342
How does it
total up, tolliver?

572
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:52,577
Barely enough, if that.

573
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,111
It's been like
pulling hen's teeth

574
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,747
To get
this much together.

575
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:58,616
Minority stockholders
are up in arms.

576
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:02,220
They're even forcing
a receivership hearing
in Denver

577
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,423
Day after tomorrow.

578
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,458
If this injunction
still holds for
the next payroll,

579
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,193
We may be
out of business.

580
00:37:09,295 --> 00:37:11,129
What do
the lawyers say?

581
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,065
Full of high-sounding
legal talk.

582
00:37:14,164 --> 00:37:15,601
Supposed to comfort you.

583
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:17,068
It scares me.

584
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:19,069
Like a doctor
telling you

585
00:37:19,169 --> 00:37:22,206
You've got hay fever
in Latin.

586
00:37:22,308 --> 00:37:23,574
General Palmer
says to me,

587
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:26,210
"Moynahan,
you're the only man
I'll trust

588
00:37:26,312 --> 00:37:28,614
Over the mountains
to Denver and back."

589
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,214
Then I says,
"general Palmer,

590
00:37:30,316 --> 00:37:32,583
"You've
no more worries

591
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:37,456
Than a newborn babe
taking his first
ride in a carriage."

592
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:41,259
(Train whistle)

593
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,295
Here she comes.

594
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,236
What's the matter?

595
00:37:52,338 --> 00:37:54,705
Fellow waving,
up the tracks.

596
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:06,785
There's a landslide
up ahead.

597
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,587
I don't see anything.

598
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,859
Now do you
see something?

599
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,826
Up!

600
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:23,835
(Gunshot)

601
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:25,202
Take it easy, beautiful.

602
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,205
Another wrong move
and somebody gets hurt.

603
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,940
All right,
scoop it up, Charlie.

604
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,378
You'll never
get away with it.

605
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:33,979
Keep your trap shut.

606
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,582
Hurry up, Charlie.
Never mind the nickels
and quarters.

607
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,817
All right.
That does it.

608
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,618
Let's go!

609
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:42,620
Thank you
for your generosity.

610
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,991
Don't anybody move
until the train starts up.

611
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:47,625
Tolliver,
don't do it!

612
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:48,960
Tolliver!

613
00:38:59,405 --> 00:39:00,738
Come on.

614
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:09,580
You men!

615
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:13,551
Help carry him inside.

616
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:46,452
Hello, general.

617
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:49,854
Hey, give me
a hand! Quick!

618
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:55,125
We were robbed
about 14 Miles down the way.

619
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:56,326
The payroll?

620
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:59,030
They got it all
and killed tolliver.

621
00:39:59,129 --> 00:40:00,031
Where's vesser?

622
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,433
He went up to...

623
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:02,400
Where are all the men?

624
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,402
The men, well...

625
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:06,404
Did you order them
back to work?

626
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,372
We thought
it was best...

627
00:40:08,474 --> 00:40:09,507
Stop them.

628
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:12,109
Tell vesser I want
to talk to him.

629
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,645
Yes, general.

630
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:24,555
We're fighting more
than McCabe and
the canyon city.

631
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:26,458
Call it
bad luck, jinx...

632
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,226
Accidents,

633
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:29,595
This robbery, all right...

634
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:33,231
But let's not add
to it with bad judgment.

635
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,732
I'm sorry.

636
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:36,968
There's no question
of your good intentions.

637
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:41,371
But starting work
in the face
of a stop-work order

638
00:40:41,473 --> 00:40:44,775
Could blow our case
in the court sky-high.

639
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,745
I know how much
you've got invested

640
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,380
And how much
your friends
have invested.

641
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:53,383
I can't stand here
and see you go down.

642
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:57,155
But this has got
to be done the right way.

643
00:40:57,254 --> 00:41:00,390
It's not only
a question of me
and my friends.

644
00:41:00,492 --> 00:41:02,460
It's the men who do
the actual work.

645
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:07,397
They're involved.
They've got a stake, too...
their jobs.

646
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:10,434
Yeah. And no pay
after the robbery.

647
00:41:10,536 --> 00:41:11,803
Say, wait a minute.

648
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:13,805
Maybe this
is a good thing.

649
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:16,406
If we can prove
that McCabe did it,

650
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:19,409
We can throw
some bad luck his way.

651
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:21,445
For a change,
that would be nice.

652
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:22,781
See you tonight.

653
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,015
Right.

654
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:26,450
Yoo-hoo!

655
00:41:26,552 --> 00:41:28,819
Jane, darling.

656
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:36,762
Oh! Mr. moynahan,
is it true the train
was robbed?

657
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:40,766
Only at the back end
where I had no control.

658
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:42,768
But they
didn't get this.

659
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:45,771
Oh, Mr. moynahan,
you shouldn't.

660
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,538
For me?

661
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:49,074
You can be
sure of that!

662
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:51,375
Oh! It's big, isn't it?

663
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:55,013
A thing of beauty,
if I say so meself.

664
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:56,281
Well...

665
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:01,286
Oh, Mr. moynahan.

666
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:02,520
You really shouldn't.

667
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,757
Here! Here!
Try this for size.

668
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,026
Oh.

669
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:10,194
This...

670
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:11,796
Well...

671
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,165
Oh, it's lovely,
isn't it?

672
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,268
I think so, too.

673
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:20,706
Yes,
it's awful nice.

674
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:24,374
Well, I better
be getting back
to me work.

675
00:42:24,474 --> 00:42:25,976
It's really not...

676
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:26,977
I...

677
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:30,148
Oh, Mr. moynahan!

678
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:31,149
Mr. moynahan.

679
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:32,883
Well...

680
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,322
10 wins.

681
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:38,824
7 loses.

682
00:42:42,628 --> 00:42:43,561
Queen wins.

683
00:42:43,662 --> 00:42:44,562
9 loses.

684
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:45,896
Place your bets,
gentlemen.

685
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:47,666
That's three times
the 9 has lost.

686
00:42:47,766 --> 00:42:50,068
That's the way it is
sometimes.

687
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:52,036
I'm going to play
that 7 once again.

688
00:42:52,137 --> 00:42:55,305
I'm betting
$40 this time
on a queen.

689
00:42:55,405 --> 00:42:57,307
That's a lot of money.

690
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,508
Who asked you?

691
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,510
Nobody. But
it's a lot of money.

692
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:02,580
You said it, and
nobody asked you.

693
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,515
Considering you
haven't been paid,

694
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:05,917
You're pretty
well-heeled.

695
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:08,552
Maybe you're
not d & rg men.

696
00:43:08,654 --> 00:43:09,921
Maybe we're...

697
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,923
Maybe we're just
lucky, that's all.

698
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:14,993
All right, gentlemen,
if you're ready.

699
00:43:16,895 --> 00:43:19,097
Deuces wins.
4 loses.

700
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:25,870
7 wins.
Queen loses.

701
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:28,106
One of you
gentlemen wins,

702
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:29,439
The other loses.

703
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:31,441
Mac, I need a gun.

704
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:32,978
Sure, Jim.

705
00:43:36,247 --> 00:43:39,049
Here's one with
a nice, smooth action.

706
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,350
Fine.

707
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:09,446
Where are the two men
losing all the money?

708
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:10,848
I told you
to keep out.

709
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:13,218
Some men held up
general Palmer.

710
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,452
They got $4,000.

711
00:44:14,552 --> 00:44:15,887
No skin
off my nose.

712
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,254
Everyone here is broke,

713
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:20,490
Yet two men lost...
How much did they drop?

714
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:21,491
How much?

715
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:22,894
You heard the boss.

716
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,831
That was payroll money
they stole and lost here.

717
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:28,834
The rest of the men here
won't get paid.

718
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:30,434
What are
you pulling?

719
00:44:30,535 --> 00:44:33,471
$4,000, and they
lost half right here.

720
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,105
Your money!

721
00:45:30,796 --> 00:45:32,429
Don't shoot.
I give up.

722
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,465
Come out
with your hands up.

723
00:45:34,564 --> 00:45:36,301
I can't. I'm hit.

724
00:45:39,569 --> 00:45:41,239
You held up that train.

725
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:43,673
I don't know what
you're talking about.

726
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:44,876
Who's the third man?

727
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:46,344
You got me wrong.

728
00:45:46,444 --> 00:45:47,745
I never robbed
no train.

729
00:45:47,846 --> 00:45:49,479
You're lying.

730
00:45:57,687 --> 00:45:58,588
Almost $1,000.

731
00:45:58,688 --> 00:46:00,557
I suppose you found it.

732
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,559
Yeah, yeah.
Me and him,

733
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:05,463
We heard about
a cache, $4,000.

734
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:17,207
About $500.
He dropped the rest
at Sloan's tent.

735
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:20,410
That's $1,000 for you,
$1,000 for him.

736
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:21,779
Who's got
the other $2,000?

737
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,981
(Hoofbeats)

738
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,757
You call this
protecting
your property,

739
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:35,060
Shooting these men?

740
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,760
The d & rg payroll
was stolen.

741
00:46:36,862 --> 00:46:38,997
Tell him, miss.
I didn't do it.

742
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,664
He killed my partner...

743
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:41,665
Shut up.

744
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:42,868
He was one
of the robbers.

745
00:46:42,968 --> 00:46:44,369
Here's the evidence.

746
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:47,372
I can't
identify this man.

747
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:50,107
The other one?

748
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:53,110
I never saw him before.
They were masked.

749
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,313
General Palmer
might know.

750
00:46:57,916 --> 00:46:59,384
Get up.

751
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:02,820
Ow.

752
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,990
This is the man who
scooped up the money.

753
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,025
No doubt about it.

754
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,027
The other
I can't identify.

755
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:11,028
The missing man
shot tolliver.

756
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:12,397
There were
three of you.

757
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,430
Who's the third?

758
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,866
Mister, my leg
has gone dead.

759
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:17,434
Let me alone.

760
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:18,669
When I get
some answers.

761
00:47:18,768 --> 00:47:21,072
Have you
ever seen this man?

762
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,074
They never
worked for us.

763
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,076
Who were you
working for, McCabe?

764
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,711
I don't know
any McCabe.

765
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,880
I don't know
about no robbery.

766
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:29,881
You're lying.

767
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,884
All I know is
you shot me.

768
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:34,251
I'm hurt bad.

769
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,220
I saw him shoot
these two men.

770
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,423
Isn't that enough
without torturing
this one?

771
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:41,626
And I suppose they weren't
trying to kill me?

772
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:44,529
What were you doing
when you found us?

773
00:47:44,629 --> 00:47:46,364
Riding.
Riding.

774
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:47,532
I ride
every afternoon.

775
00:47:47,632 --> 00:47:50,568
You wouldn't know
more about this, would you?

776
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:51,569
Why...

777
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:53,038
Enough, Jim.

778
00:47:53,138 --> 00:47:56,340
Linda, you better
go to your tent.

779
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:02,880
Very well.

780
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,282
Jim...

781
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:10,255
You think McCabe
is back of the robbery?

782
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:11,122
I'm certain.

783
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,391
They were headed
for his camp.

784
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,593
Somebody knew
the payroll was
on that train.

785
00:48:16,694 --> 00:48:17,695
Yeah.

786
00:48:17,795 --> 00:48:21,165
I've got to find out
who it was.

787
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,907
Oh,
isn't that wonderful?

788
00:48:30,008 --> 00:48:31,741
There it is again.

789
00:48:31,841 --> 00:48:32,910
A wedding.

790
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:35,379
You going to accept
me proposal?

791
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,616
Mr. moynahan,
this is captain
vesser's fortune.

792
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:40,018
He's going
to marry

793
00:48:40,118 --> 00:48:41,519
General Palmer's
secretary.

794
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:44,154
Is that a fact, now?

795
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:44,922
Oh, yes.

796
00:48:45,023 --> 00:48:47,058
It's in the cards.
See?

797
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:49,759
They're just crazy
about each other.

798
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:51,963
Mightn't it be good
to tell them,

799
00:48:52,063 --> 00:48:53,363
In case
they don't know?

800
00:48:53,464 --> 00:48:56,601
Well, most people
know when they're
in love,

801
00:48:56,701 --> 00:48:58,136
Mr. moynahan.

802
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,940
'Tis a grand feeling,
ain't it, darling?

803
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:04,875
Yes.

804
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:06,944
Yes, it is.

805
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,882
What do you mean
coming in here?

806
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:14,452
I want
to talk to you.

807
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:15,853
Talk to me tomorrow.

808
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,088
Where were you
coming from
this afternoon?

809
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:19,589
What are
you driving at?

810
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,792
You were coming
from the direction
of McCabe's camp.

811
00:49:22,892 --> 00:49:24,062
What were you doing?

812
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:26,730
You must've gathered
I don't like you.

813
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:28,066
That doesn't matter.

814
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:29,433
I don't like killers.

815
00:49:29,534 --> 00:49:32,602
You've got three seconds
to get out of my tent!

816
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:34,039
You listen to me!

817
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:36,273
Let go of me!

818
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:43,213
Get out of here.

819
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:46,251
Get out!

820
00:50:04,135 --> 00:50:05,802
Good evening,
Mr. vesser.

821
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:07,304
Hello, Jane.

822
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:09,374
'Tis a fine evening,
is it not?

823
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:10,641
Yeah, it is.

824
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,209
Have you set
the date yet?

825
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:13,010
What?

826
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,980
I mean,
have you told her?

827
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:17,181
Oh, dear.

828
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:19,449
Anyway, she's
a beautiful girl.

829
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:20,450
Yeah.

830
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:22,986
Yeah, she sure is.

831
00:50:23,088 --> 00:50:25,289
(Telegraph clicking)

832
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:28,893
Why did I have
to open my big mouth?

833
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:31,629
It must have been
in the cards, darling.

834
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:33,531
(Telegraph clicking)

835
00:50:37,302 --> 00:50:38,303
The injunction's
lifted!

836
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:39,903
The message
just came through.

837
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:41,938
Now we can
get to work.

838
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,407
I'll tell the general.

839
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:48,579
It'll be the first
good news he's had
in a long time.

840
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:51,082
She is
a beautiful girl.

841
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:54,484
Read this.

842
00:51:02,992 --> 00:51:04,461
Linda!

843
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,100
I'm sorry.
Something very important.

844
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,136
Right away.

845
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:12,702
That'll give me time

846
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:15,705
To survey
the rest of the work

847
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:18,108
And ample time
to get back

848
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,311
To the receivership
hearing the next afternoon.

849
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,845
The injunction's
been lifted.

850
00:51:21,946 --> 00:51:23,080
That's wonderful.

851
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:25,816
Get the records
together in the morning.

852
00:51:25,915 --> 00:51:27,152
We'll leave after lunch.

853
00:51:27,252 --> 00:51:28,153
Yes, general.

854
00:51:28,253 --> 00:51:29,853
Good night.

855
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:35,058
That is good news.

856
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,095
Now let's get busy
on this advance survey.

857
00:51:38,196 --> 00:51:39,664
Sit down, Jim.

858
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:41,030
Uh, miss Nelson.

859
00:51:41,132 --> 00:51:44,401
McCabe's got
to see you right away.

860
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:54,679
I came as quickly
as I could.
What is it?

861
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:57,315
We've heard
the injunction's
been lifted.

862
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:59,317
The message
came through tonight.

863
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:01,319
What's Palmer
going to do?

864
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:03,052
What's that got
to do with vesser?

865
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,321
I'll fix him,

866
00:52:04,422 --> 00:52:07,658
But I've got
to know what's going on.

867
00:52:10,027 --> 00:52:11,962
What's the matter
with you?

868
00:52:12,061 --> 00:52:13,797
Don't you trust me?

869
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:18,235
We have to go back
tomorrow afternoon.

870
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:21,206
The general has
an important meeting
the next day.

871
00:52:21,306 --> 00:52:22,373
Tomorrow
afternoon, huh?

872
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,974
Yes. But vesser's
staying at camp.

873
00:52:25,074 --> 00:52:26,042
Sure.

874
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,145
Sure. That gives us
a chance.

875
00:52:28,246 --> 00:52:31,080
That's all I wanted
to find out.

876
00:52:31,182 --> 00:52:33,150
Don't let anybody
see you return.

877
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:35,118
What are you
going to do?

878
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,454
Leave that to me.

879
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:39,424
Good night.

880
00:52:40,691 --> 00:52:42,427
Good night.

881
00:52:56,374 --> 00:52:58,908
Get her mad,
you'll find out something.

882
00:52:59,008 --> 00:53:00,311
Round up
the men tonight.

883
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,912
Have them ready
to pick up

884
00:53:03,012 --> 00:53:05,283
In the morning
at elk's bridge.

885
00:53:05,383 --> 00:53:08,918
General Palmer's
going to have trouble
getting to Denver.

886
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,388
All right, men.
Let's go!

887
00:53:37,248 --> 00:53:40,584
(Train whistle)

888
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:02,006
Come down
with your hands up!

889
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:03,240
Hurry up!

890
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,076
Throw him
in the caboose
and tie him up.

891
00:54:06,175 --> 00:54:07,911
Get back there!

892
00:54:41,912 --> 00:54:44,815
I intend
to cut through
that point there.

893
00:54:44,915 --> 00:54:48,419
It'll save us
2 1/2 Miles
to the gorge

894
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:50,455
And cut down
the grade
considerably.

895
00:54:50,555 --> 00:54:53,458
Good idea. It'll save us
crossing the river again.

896
00:54:53,558 --> 00:54:56,060
Yes, that's why
I thought of it.

897
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:58,796
We'll stop back
this way.

898
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,463
Get rid
of those two.

899
00:55:33,564 --> 00:55:37,368
I think
they're feeling
just about right now.

900
00:55:40,169 --> 00:55:41,506
All right!
Quiet! Quiet!

901
00:55:41,606 --> 00:55:42,907
Now listen to me.

902
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:46,477
You said you
could lick your
weight in wildcats.

903
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:47,845
Bring on
your wildcats!

904
00:55:47,945 --> 00:55:51,849
You're going
to get your chance
right now.

905
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:53,216
Let's get aboard.

906
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:55,685
Come on, fellas.
Let's go!

907
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,303
Don't break that.
We may need it.

908
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,439
You've worked
a telegraph?

909
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:49,540
Yeah.
For eight years.

910
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,108
You take charge.

911
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:54,243
Everybody else
back on the train.

912
00:56:54,343 --> 00:56:55,244
Let's go!

913
00:56:55,344 --> 00:56:56,846
Here we go!

914
00:56:56,947 --> 00:56:58,115
Come on!

915
00:57:00,618 --> 00:57:02,752
All right,
spikebuck next stop!

916
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:03,420
Let's go!

917
00:57:39,188 --> 00:57:42,092
All right, men.
Get aboard.

918
00:58:26,737 --> 00:58:29,039
Hey! None of that!

919
00:58:30,541 --> 00:58:32,009
O.K. Let's go!

920
00:58:32,109 --> 00:58:34,511
Get back
on the train.

921
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,335
All right.
That's all of 'em.

922
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:02,338
Let Palmer try
to get to Denver now.

923
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:05,009
We'll stand by
at the other end.

924
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:18,956
General Palmer!
General Palmer!

925
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:21,592
I just got a message
from parkdale.

926
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:22,959
Before he got cut off,

927
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,562
The operator said
a canyon city gang

928
00:59:25,663 --> 00:59:27,964
On a stolen train
was attacking him.

929
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:29,966
What's this about
a train attacking?

930
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:31,968
He said a trainload
of men attacking.

931
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:35,038
Go get our men.
Bring them into camp.

932
00:59:38,643 --> 00:59:41,044
Now get Texas creek.

933
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:46,950
No answer.

934
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,619
Swallows.

935
00:59:54,323 --> 00:59:55,424
Try Denver.

936
00:59:55,524 --> 00:59:57,026
Wire's dead that far.

937
00:59:57,127 --> 00:59:59,263
(Click click click)

938
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:01,965
Well, what is it?

939
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:02,899
Parkdale!

940
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:03,600
Well, what's the message?

941
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,770
It's not for us.
It's not our operator.

942
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:09,205
They've taken
every station
along the line.

943
01:00:09,306 --> 01:00:11,808
McCabe's stolen a train.
He's captured everything.

944
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:13,810
Right after the
injunction was lifted.

945
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:16,780
I've got to be in Denver
before tomorrow afternoon.

946
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,416
They're
keeping you here
until it's too late

947
01:00:19,516 --> 01:00:21,218
So they can capture
the d & rg.

948
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:23,921
They've got our rails,
nothing gets through.

949
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,521
What's your plan, captain?

950
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:26,890
We've got a train here.

951
01:00:26,991 --> 01:00:29,927
I'll take it through
same as they did.

952
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:31,527
Many people may get hurt.

953
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,896
They'll hold it by force.

954
01:00:32,997 --> 01:00:35,499
This is a job
for the sheriff.

955
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:38,501
He can't do anything
until we notify him.

956
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:40,970
What are your orders,
general?

957
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:49,146
Take the train through.

958
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:52,381
Tell the men
I want to talk to them.

959
01:00:52,481 --> 01:00:53,482
All right.

960
01:00:53,582 --> 01:00:55,952
After that,
you're in charge.

961
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:03,660
All right, men.
Everybody gather around.

962
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,330
The general has something
to tell you.

963
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:15,371
Men, you have
a right to know

964
01:01:15,472 --> 01:01:17,373
What's been going on.

965
01:01:17,474 --> 01:01:20,177
As you know,
it's been a series

966
01:01:20,277 --> 01:01:22,780
Of one unfortunate thing
after another.

967
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:24,380
That's right.
That's right.

968
01:01:24,481 --> 01:01:26,784
It's been a battle
from the start

969
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:29,186
With the canyon city
and San Juan,

970
01:01:29,286 --> 01:01:32,822
But the d & rg has always
fought it legally

971
01:01:32,923 --> 01:01:34,191
Through the courts.

972
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:37,327
And last night
we won part of that fight.

973
01:01:37,426 --> 01:01:38,695
We won it our way.

974
01:01:38,796 --> 01:01:41,832
The injunction was lifted.
We're back at work!

975
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:45,402
Hooray!

976
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:49,605
But to clear up everything
and settle it all,

977
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,608
It's necessary
that I get back to Denver.

978
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:56,981
Somehow, someway, McCabe
found out about this,

979
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,615
And he's gone up
our track...

980
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,584
Track you men have laid...

981
01:02:01,684 --> 01:02:03,720
And he's captured
every single depot

982
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,056
Along the line.

983
01:02:07,925 --> 01:02:11,027
Now, unless
I get back to Denver

984
01:02:11,128 --> 01:02:12,629
Before tomorrow afternoon,

985
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:13,997
The d & rg

986
01:02:14,098 --> 01:02:17,034
Goes into the hands
of the receiver.

987
01:02:17,134 --> 01:02:19,402
And I have reason to believe

988
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:23,808
Those receivers are
canyon city and San Juan!

989
01:02:27,044 --> 01:02:30,414
What are we
going to do about it?

990
01:02:32,448 --> 01:02:33,950
Kill them! Kill them!

991
01:02:34,051 --> 01:02:37,486
We'll get them,
won't we, moynahan?

992
01:02:37,586 --> 01:02:40,089
I'm mulling over
the idea.

993
01:02:42,526 --> 01:02:43,828
All right, men.
All right.

994
01:02:43,928 --> 01:02:47,230
We've got a train
and tracks to run it on,

995
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:49,834
And we'll run it
right through to Denver!

996
01:02:49,934 --> 01:02:52,601
I want some men
to go with me...

997
01:02:52,701 --> 01:02:54,203
20 good fighting men.

998
01:02:54,304 --> 01:02:55,571
Are you with me?

999
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:57,274
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!

1000
01:03:02,711 --> 01:03:03,780
Come on, men.

1001
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,315
Go on!

1002
01:03:11,355 --> 01:03:15,192
Come on!
Let's get into the fight!

1003
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:18,727
There's not a good fight
in the lot of them.

1004
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:21,730
What in heaven's name
are you up to?

1005
01:03:21,832 --> 01:03:24,733
Haven't you heard?
There's going to be a fight.

1006
01:03:24,835 --> 01:03:26,135
Indeed,
but we needn't worry.

1007
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:28,237
Our boys
will come through.

1008
01:03:31,608 --> 01:03:33,477
Mr. moynahan, I just know

1009
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:36,513
I'm going to be
so proud of you.

1010
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:37,646
Well, I...

1011
01:03:37,746 --> 01:03:39,383
I read it in the cards.

1012
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:43,052
Tell me, darling.
Do you believe
in them there cards?

1013
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:44,620
They're always right.

1014
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:48,458
Give me that gun
and let me...

1015
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:53,864
All right. All right.
That's enough.

1016
01:03:53,964 --> 01:03:55,231
Go ahead, gil.

1017
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:58,301
You volunteers
get aboard the train.

1018
01:04:07,211 --> 01:04:09,746
I'll take her out
this time, moynahan.

1019
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,715
First time in six years.

1020
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:13,116
Sure.
You never forget.

1021
01:04:13,217 --> 01:04:14,718
And since
it's crowded,

1022
01:04:14,818 --> 01:04:16,119
I'll just
be stepping down.

1023
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:20,590
No! There's plenty of room
when I go to my side.

1024
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:22,893
Let's go!

1025
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:24,260
Parkdale, next stop!

1026
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:27,997
I'll go back and
check with the men.

1027
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:53,756
Coming through, Mac.

1028
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:56,160
How'd you get aboard
this train?

1029
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:58,162
Just climbed aboard,
that's all.

1030
01:04:58,261 --> 01:04:59,930
Coffee's
almost ready.

1031
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:01,966
No telling
what will happen.

1032
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:03,533
Yes, there's no telling.

1033
01:05:03,632 --> 01:05:05,335
Even you
might get hungry.

1034
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:07,336
Don't worry about me,
captain vesser.

1035
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:10,339
Old Betsy
will take care of me.

1036
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,676
And besides, somebody's
got to chaperon her.

1037
01:05:15,812 --> 01:05:17,714
I'm counting on
surprising them,

1038
01:05:17,814 --> 01:05:19,216
But in case
there's shooting,

1039
01:05:19,316 --> 01:05:22,351
Keep everybody down
below the level
of the windows.

1040
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:23,319
Right, captain.

1041
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,754
Follow my lead at
the first station.

1042
01:05:25,854 --> 01:05:26,889
No shooting
without orders.

1043
01:05:26,991 --> 01:05:29,960
Stand by and wait
for my signal.

1044
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:44,407
(Train whistle)

1045
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:48,645
Gil, don't advertise
that we're coming.

1046
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:50,981
Oh, that's right, Jim.

1047
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:25,049
Get back!

1048
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,271
Take her ahead.
Get going!

1049
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:12,262
They were expecting us.

1050
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:14,264
How'd they know
we were coming?

1051
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:16,900
They knew like they had
our timetable.

1052
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,268
They must have guessed it.

1053
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:20,869
Let's say it was a guess...
This time.

1054
01:07:20,969 --> 01:07:23,506
Men, I said
there'd be a fight.

1055
01:07:23,607 --> 01:07:25,275
We walked into a trap,

1056
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:28,744
But we'll be ready
for them the next time.

1057
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:36,785
Train's coming! Get down!

1058
01:08:08,118 --> 01:08:10,454
(Train whistle)

1059
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:28,605
Murphy, get to
your telegraph key.

1060
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:33,008
McCabe's always
one step ahead of us.

1061
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,443
Somebody's
tipped him off.

1062
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:37,480
He'd anticipate our trying
to take back the depot.

1063
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,683
This was no last
minute planning.

1064
01:08:39,783 --> 01:08:41,218
He knew
our intentions,

1065
01:08:41,318 --> 01:08:44,453
Like he knew when
you were returning
with that payroll.

1066
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:46,723
Somebody's
been giving him
definite information

1067
01:08:46,823 --> 01:08:48,023
For a long time.

1068
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:51,460
If you're trying to say
I'm a spy, say it.

1069
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:54,062
I've known Mr. McCabe
for a long time,

1070
01:08:54,164 --> 01:08:58,534
But it has nothing to do
with the d & rg.

1071
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:06,743
(Train whistle)

1072
01:09:06,843 --> 01:09:08,444
Something's up.

1073
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,111
All right, men.
Come up here.

1074
01:09:43,213 --> 01:09:45,080
Heave this stuff over there.

1075
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:47,951
Throw the rest
over the side.

1076
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:52,856
Come on.
Get moving, will you?

1077
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:55,424
Well, it's pretty solid.

1078
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:58,026
Yeah, it'll take
too long to clear.

1079
01:09:58,126 --> 01:10:00,162
There's another way
to handle this.

1080
01:10:00,264 --> 01:10:02,799
All right, men,
back on the train.

1081
01:10:02,899 --> 01:10:04,200
Come on! Get moving!

1082
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:15,411
Take her back.

1083
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:16,979
We're not licked yet.

1084
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,347
We got
to use strategy

1085
01:10:18,448 --> 01:10:21,017
Or McCabe
will block off
every station.

1086
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:22,586
Keep firing.

1087
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:16,705
We'll take that depot
and take it quick,

1088
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:18,941
Before they use
that telegraph again.

1089
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:20,709
I'll get the men ready.

1090
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:23,780
Give me a minute,
then take her ahead.

1091
01:12:08,123 --> 01:12:09,393
Get their guns.

1092
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:11,027
Who can pound
a telegraph?

1093
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:12,260
I can.

1094
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:14,564
Tell the next station
the Denver train's

1095
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:16,165
Gone back to railhead.

1096
01:12:16,264 --> 01:12:18,134
You stay here. You, too.

1097
01:12:18,234 --> 01:12:20,536
The rest of you men
get aboard.

1098
01:12:20,637 --> 01:12:23,539
Stick by that telegraph key
until I send word.

1099
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:26,609
The code word
will be "Palmer."

1100
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:04,380
Go ahead!
Full speed!

1101
01:13:33,676 --> 01:13:36,613
(Click click click)

1102
01:13:39,616 --> 01:13:41,551
They've come through
the blockade.

1103
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:43,119
Texas creek's 22 Miles.

1104
01:13:43,218 --> 01:13:45,522
They'll be here
in half an hour.

1105
01:13:45,622 --> 01:13:48,124
There's no time
for a big blockade.

1106
01:13:48,223 --> 01:13:50,158
There's another way
to stop them.

1107
01:13:50,258 --> 01:13:51,461
How?

1108
01:13:51,561 --> 01:13:55,031
We got a train ain't
much good on this track

1109
01:13:55,131 --> 01:13:56,432
Unless they got it.

1110
01:13:56,533 --> 01:13:58,867
Let's let them have it.

1111
01:13:59,703 --> 01:14:01,169
With our men scattered,

1112
01:14:01,269 --> 01:14:03,573
We don't have
enough left to fight.

1113
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:06,175
You can
play around with it,

1114
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,578
But my idea's
the only one.

1115
01:14:08,677 --> 01:14:10,814
General Palmer's
on that train.

1116
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:12,448
So?

1117
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:15,418
Yeah.

1118
01:14:15,519 --> 01:14:17,152
Yeah. Come on.

1119
01:14:17,253 --> 01:14:18,822
Let's go.

1120
01:14:18,922 --> 01:14:22,492
All right, give her
plenty of speed.

1121
01:14:39,543 --> 01:14:41,745
Slow down.

1122
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:45,749
All right,
get ready to jump.

1123
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:52,088
Now open her up and jump.

1124
01:15:15,443 --> 01:15:18,314
Hey, there's a train
coming toward us!

1125
01:15:18,414 --> 01:15:20,783
Stop it!

1126
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:53,617
I can't make it.

1127
01:15:53,717 --> 01:15:56,219
We've got to protect
those coaches
back there.

1128
01:15:56,319 --> 01:15:59,122
Open her wide,
and we'll jump.

1129
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:01,190
Come on, jump!

1130
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:13,863
There's nobody aboard.

1131
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:15,498
You thought
there would be?

1132
01:17:15,598 --> 01:17:17,934
McCabe tried to kill us.

1133
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:24,339
Oh, Mr. moynahan!

1134
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:25,908
You're safe!

1135
01:17:28,911 --> 01:17:31,413
(Palmer) We could
have been in that.

1136
01:17:31,514 --> 01:17:33,216
Thanks to you,
captain.

1137
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:34,582
This stops us, general.

1138
01:17:34,684 --> 01:17:36,019
Are they completely
demolished?

1139
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:38,586
Completely.
It'll take days
to clear that track.

1140
01:17:38,688 --> 01:17:40,388
I've still got
to get to Denver.

1141
01:17:40,488 --> 01:17:43,226
McCabe will be cautious
about coming around here.

1142
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:45,027
That gives us a chance.

1143
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:47,029
Jeb! Luke!
You know the trail

1144
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:49,265
Leading to
Cooper's trading post?

1145
01:17:49,365 --> 01:17:50,666
They'll be your guide.

1146
01:17:50,767 --> 01:17:52,567
You can get horses there.

1147
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:55,204
Ride down the Mountain.
Cut into the railroad
at swallows.

1148
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:58,274
You'll make Denver
in time for your
receivership hearing.

1149
01:17:58,374 --> 01:17:59,743
What about you?

1150
01:17:59,843 --> 01:18:02,345
McCabe won't destroy
the rails into the gorge.

1151
01:18:02,445 --> 01:18:03,813
We'll barricade
by the river.

1152
01:18:03,912 --> 01:18:06,415
Notify the sheriff
to get deputies back here.

1153
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,616
We'll hold off
till they come.

1154
01:18:08,718 --> 01:18:12,287
It's the only way
to save the d & rg.

1155
01:18:12,388 --> 01:18:13,689
All right,
we'll try it.

1156
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:15,091
You're
in full charge here.

1157
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:17,693
I'll try to get you
some help.

1158
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:19,763
All right, men.
Linda.

1159
01:18:20,896 --> 01:18:24,233
If we'd been killed,
it would have been
your fault.

1160
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:27,703
Why did you give information
to a murderer?

1161
01:18:27,804 --> 01:18:29,604
I'll tell you why...

1162
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,639
You killed my brother.

1163
01:18:31,741 --> 01:18:34,176
My real name's
Linda Nelson.

1164
01:18:34,277 --> 01:18:37,814
McCabe told me how you
shot Bob in cold blood.

1165
01:18:37,914 --> 01:18:39,715
And you believed him?

1166
01:18:39,816 --> 01:18:41,317
He was there.

1167
01:18:41,417 --> 01:18:43,685
He saw you.

1168
01:18:43,787 --> 01:18:45,087
But after
what's happened...

1169
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:49,392
I don't know
what to believe.

1170
01:18:49,492 --> 01:18:51,459
I've got
to find out.

1171
01:18:51,559 --> 01:18:53,429
Stop her.

1172
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:55,431
What more can she do?

1173
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:56,800
Let her go.

1174
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:59,268
That is an order,
captain.

1175
01:19:12,281 --> 01:19:14,349
(Gunshots)

1176
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:37,005
We didn't finish this
too soon.

1177
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:39,641
Bees have been buzzing
around since dawn.

1178
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:40,910
(Gunshot ricochets)

1179
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:42,744
Yeah, lead bees.

1180
01:19:42,846 --> 01:19:44,746
Wonder what he's up to?

1181
01:19:44,848 --> 01:19:46,114
I can't tell yet.

1182
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:48,083
They're all hiding
behind a breastwork.

1183
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:51,753
McCabe knows
he's got to act fast
before help comes.

1184
01:19:51,855 --> 01:19:53,456
We can't let down.

1185
01:20:02,966 --> 01:20:04,800
I'm going out
and take a better look.

1186
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,102
Be careful, Jim.

1187
01:20:07,202 --> 01:20:08,537
Right.

1188
01:20:29,392 --> 01:20:32,961
They're moving a flatcar
towards our tracks.

1189
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:37,333
It's downgrade
from their position.

1190
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:40,503
This will slow them up.

1191
01:20:48,776 --> 01:20:51,547
All right,
let's get going here.

1192
01:21:17,773 --> 01:21:19,675
I've got
to see McCabe.

1193
01:21:19,775 --> 01:21:22,077
You'll see him soon enough.
He's busy.

1194
01:21:22,178 --> 01:21:23,679
I must talk
with him.

1195
01:21:23,778 --> 01:21:26,682
He has a little matter
to attend to first

1196
01:21:26,781 --> 01:21:28,083
Concerning
a man named vesser.

1197
01:21:28,184 --> 01:21:30,718
It should make you
plenty happy.

1198
01:21:30,818 --> 01:21:33,155
Take me to him.

1199
01:21:36,993 --> 01:21:40,163
Take it easy... Beautiful.

1200
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:50,173
He's going to run
a flatcar of dynamite in

1201
01:21:50,272 --> 01:21:53,176
And blow your friends
out of their hole.

1202
01:21:53,275 --> 01:21:57,745
Why so anxious about McCabe
when I'm here?

1203
01:21:57,845 --> 01:21:59,048
Come here.

1204
01:21:59,147 --> 01:22:02,451
You held up the train
and killed tolliver!

1205
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:06,121
That don't make
any difference
with you and me.

1206
01:22:09,692 --> 01:22:10,960
Buff.

1207
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:13,662
You blasted fool!

1208
01:22:15,197 --> 01:22:16,832
You did steal the money

1209
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:21,104
And almost ruined everything
for the canyon city
and San Juan.

1210
01:22:21,203 --> 01:22:22,704
All right, big boy.

1211
01:22:22,805 --> 01:22:24,072
He shot your brother.

1212
01:22:24,173 --> 01:22:26,074
It wasn't vesser,
it was McCabe.

1213
01:22:26,175 --> 01:22:29,711
He's so dumb I had
to cook up his story.

1214
01:22:29,812 --> 01:22:31,646
Ask him to deny it.

1215
01:22:31,747 --> 01:22:33,616
I'll take care of you later.

1216
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:35,650
You're no better
than the rest.

1217
01:22:35,751 --> 01:22:37,653
Get out there and help.

1218
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:40,023
You killed Bob.

1219
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:18,760
Get in there!

1220
01:23:18,861 --> 01:23:20,162
Stand clear over there.

1221
01:23:20,262 --> 01:23:21,730
We ain't got all day.

1222
01:23:21,829 --> 01:23:23,799
Now, put your shoulder
into it.

1223
01:23:23,898 --> 01:23:26,201
Let's go! Heave!

1224
01:23:27,269 --> 01:23:30,073
All right. Jack her up.

1225
01:23:47,156 --> 01:23:50,526
All right. Let's have
those ties up here.

1226
01:23:52,095 --> 01:23:53,361
Build me a barricade

1227
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:56,599
Just high enough
to protect that powder.

1228
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:58,466
Where's the dynamite?

1229
01:24:02,305 --> 01:24:04,839
Come on! Cast
them ties up here.

1230
01:24:04,939 --> 01:24:06,842
Make it fast, boys.

1231
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:09,644
Slide it in there.

1232
01:24:09,745 --> 01:24:11,046
There goes the girl!

1233
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:13,416
She's running to vesser.

1234
01:24:16,519 --> 01:24:18,220
(Gunshot)

1235
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:25,026
It's Linda Nelson.

1236
01:24:25,128 --> 01:24:26,629
They're shooting at her.

1237
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:29,264
Fire to cover, men.

1238
01:24:40,343 --> 01:24:43,378
Never mind the girl.
Get this car going.

1239
01:24:43,478 --> 01:24:44,280
Come on!

1240
01:24:44,379 --> 01:24:47,515
Hold it!
Hold your fire, men.

1241
01:24:47,616 --> 01:24:50,085
Vesser! Vesser!

1242
01:24:50,952 --> 01:24:52,655
Let's go here.

1243
01:25:10,806 --> 01:25:12,508
Take care of her,
will you?

1244
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:15,077
Men, stand back
and brace yourselves.

1245
01:25:15,178 --> 01:25:16,679
That flatcar...

1246
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:18,045
That wall will hold.

1247
01:25:18,146 --> 01:25:19,448
It's loaded
with dynamite.

1248
01:25:19,547 --> 01:25:22,185
What? Everybody back!
Run, men!

1249
01:25:22,285 --> 01:25:24,187
That flatcar's
loaded with dynamite.

1250
01:25:24,287 --> 01:25:26,155
Take shelter! Go on!

1251
01:25:26,254 --> 01:25:29,692
Mr. moynahan!
Mr. moynahan!

1252
01:25:43,104 --> 01:25:46,007
Mr. moynahan!
Mr. moynahan!

1253
01:25:46,107 --> 01:25:49,043
Don't loiter.
It's going to blow up.

1254
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:50,813
Oh...

1255
01:25:50,913 --> 01:25:52,514
Oh!

1256
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:33,087
Captain vesser,
you've got to be
taught a lesson.

1257
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:35,089
Fighting a war
in peacetime

1258
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:37,726
Is the business
of peace officers,

1259
01:26:37,826 --> 01:26:39,093
Not private citizens.

1260
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:41,095
We have law
in this country.

1261
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:43,732
If a man breaks
the law against you,

1262
01:26:43,832 --> 01:26:45,099
You're as guilty as him

1263
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,803
If you break the law
getting back at him.

1264
01:26:47,903 --> 01:26:49,103
Sorry, Jim.

1265
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:51,707
I'll have to take you
into custody again.

1266
01:26:51,807 --> 01:26:54,710
You're going to
arrest this nice man

1267
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:57,313
Just because McCabe
blew himself up?

1268
01:26:57,413 --> 01:27:00,515
No... well, yes.
That's what I aim to do.

1269
01:27:00,615 --> 01:27:02,517
Ed Johnson,
you're a skunk!

1270
01:27:02,617 --> 01:27:05,119
General, you understand
it's my duty

1271
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,522
To get this all settled
legal-like.

1272
01:27:07,622 --> 01:27:08,957
You're right.
Absolutely right, ed.

1273
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:12,127
Yes, sir. And, general,
I'm surprised at you, too,

1274
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:14,530
Letting him talk you
into it like that.

1275
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:16,764
I'm as guilty
as the captain.

1276
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:18,133
I gave the orders.

1277
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:19,767
Arrest him,
arrest me.

1278
01:27:19,867 --> 01:27:21,168
Now, general, uh...

1279
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:24,138
Well, I don't think a jury's

1280
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:27,141
Going to find you
too much to blame.

1281
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:30,645
Anyhow, you...
You still got the railroad.

1282
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:31,747
Now, uh...

1283
01:27:31,847 --> 01:27:34,283
Where is everybody?

1284
01:27:34,382 --> 01:27:38,653
I'll be around
if you want to
arrest me, too, sheriff.

1285
01:27:38,754 --> 01:27:40,488
Oh.

1286
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:41,589
Oh.

1287
01:27:41,689 --> 01:27:44,492
Mr. moynahan,
have you ever been
a fireman?

1288
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:48,764
Why, yes.
In me younger days
on the allegheny run,

1289
01:27:48,864 --> 01:27:50,164
I was the best fireman...

1290
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:52,166
Well, get firing.

1291
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:54,870
Oh, I didn't, uh...

1292
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:56,271
I just didn't...

1293
01:27:56,372 --> 01:27:58,740
Oh, Mr. moynahan.

1294
01:27:59,875 --> 01:28:01,175
Oh, no.

1295
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:02,744
Oh!

1296
01:28:02,845 --> 01:28:05,280
Thanks.

1297
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,614
For what?

1298
01:28:06,715 --> 01:28:09,216
For coming
to tell us in time.

1299
01:28:09,318 --> 01:28:11,854
I found out McCabe
killed my brother.

1300
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:13,220
I wasn't sure.

1301
01:28:13,321 --> 01:28:16,223
I was beginning
to believe I'd done it.

1302
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:18,225
I'm so sorry
for everything.

1303
01:28:18,326 --> 01:28:21,496
It was hard
hating you so much.

1304
01:28:21,597 --> 01:28:23,498
That's all right.
Forget it.

1305
01:28:23,599 --> 01:28:26,969
We've still got
a railroad to build.
