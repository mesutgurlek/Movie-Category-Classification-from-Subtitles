1
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,072
You're 7 today.
You're a man now

2
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,432
Bury your first toy and the
portrait of your mother

3
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,874
THE MOLE

4
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,874
The mole is an animal that
digs tunnels underground

5
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,673
ln search of the sun, it sometimes
comes to the surface

6
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,117
When it sees the sun, it is blinded

7
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,876
Kill me! Kill me, please!

8
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,758
Who was it?

9
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,598
Kill me, for pity's sake!

10
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,716
Who was it?

11
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,879
Who?

12
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,195
Who?

13
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,438
- lt's the colonel
- How many?

14
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,478
Another five men

15
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,438
Where?

16
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,749
ln the Franciscan mission

17
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:06,071
The colonel's not selfish. He uses
women once and gives them away

18
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,596
The colonel said he'd kill anyone
who touches me

19
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,870
And who told you to?

20
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,719
Don't anticipate my wishes!

21
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,794
Sorry!

22
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,397
They have no souls,

23
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,749
but sometimes they get bored
and l throw them my leftovers


24
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,958
Come on, dogs! Take your
little piece!

25
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,635
Stop, dogs!

26
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,988
Kiss them on the mouth

27
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,353
Keep going! Kiss the other too!


28
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,799
Stop, dogs! Be good


29
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,758
These dogs like to watch

30
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,389
They want to see your breasts

31
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,918
Eat, dogs!

32
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,794
Who are you to hand out justice?

33
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,511
l'm God

34
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,797
No...this no! Don't do this to me!
No!

35
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,479
Destroy me.
Never depend on anyone

36
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,949
Cry little boy! Cry and
then he'll pity you

37
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,668
lt's bitter

38
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,597
Moses found water in the desert

39
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,469
The people couldn't drink it
because it was bitter


40
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,878
The water was named Marah

41
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,116
lt's turned sweet!

42
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,556
l'll call you Marah because
you're like bitter water

43
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,431
How will we live here?

44
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,994
We'll die of thirst

45
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,751
As the deer yearns
for water,

46
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,470
so my soul invokes you, Lord

47
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,429
My soul is thirsty for God,
for the living God

48
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,913
Nothing

49
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,509
Nothing

50
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,631
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

51
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,440
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

52
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,553
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

53
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,198
- Do you love me?
- Yes

54
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,070
Me no. For me to love you,
you've got to be better

55
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,315
The four masters of the gun
live in this desert

56
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,990
l must find them and kill them

57
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,954
The desert is round. To find the 4
masters we must move in a spiral

58
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,274
l can't go on, let's go back!

59
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,314
l always end up where l started

60
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,957
We'll never find them

61
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,709
lf they're masters,
they'll give us a sign

62
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,909
Days have passed...weeks, months

63
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,996
- How can you still have faith?
- They're waiting for us


64
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,275
The sign!

65
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,911
Seek the light at midday. He'll
come. You must wait to see him

66
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,634
Like that woman

67
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,751
The master didn't want to fight her

68
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,799
The master wants to receive
you know. lt's strange...

69
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,271
he never receives people
without making them wait

70
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,550
There's an oasis behind
the dune

71
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,470
Your woman will wait there

72
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,353
Let's go

73
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,590
Give me the gun and the sombrero

74
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,319
l don't need the light. l'm blind

75
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,517
Count to three and try to take it

76
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,710
One...

77
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,918
two...three!

78
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,310
How?


79
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,639
l do not try to win, but to arrive
at perfect control

80
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,669
to not be afraid of the bullets

81
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,835
Shoot!

82
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,916
They hardly bleed. l offer no
resistance to the bullet

83
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,796
l let it pass through the
capillaries of my flesh

84
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,194
You still want to duel with me?

85
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,072
Yes

86
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,836
lt does not grieve me to kill you,
because death does not exist

87
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,629
l will let you shoot first

88
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,955
- He's superior to me
- You'll win!

89
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,994
Even if l won, l'd lose

90
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,712
l'm asking you a favour.
You must win

91
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,919
Don't be so honest.
Try to invent something

92
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,994
Lay a trap. There's always
a way to win. Find it!

93
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,916
l told you! l expected it,
l'm proud of you!

94
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,997
There are only 3 masters left

95
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,235
l know where the 2nd lives. lf you
let me come with you, l'll show you

96
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,071
He's here, wait for me

97
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,910
We were waiting for you.
The cards say this about you

98
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,355
You're falling and you'll
fall anyway

99
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,876
The deeper you fall,
the higher you'll get

100
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,839
Traitor, coward, murderer!

101
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,753
God's will is unexplainable

102
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,033
My son and l must respect you

103
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,750
You can duel with him

104
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,068
Cross!

105
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,716
The duel starts right now

106
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,909
You and my son can shoot
when you want

107
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,869
Dead!

108
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:02,115
Technically you're dead

109
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,992
Now l want to talk to the dead one

110
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,879
Follow me

111
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,957
First of all, l made things
out of copper

112
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,800
and l strengthened my fingers

113
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,835
Now l make delicate objects

114
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:30,428
l'm so strong that l can play
with this shape

115
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,438
without breaking it

116
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,109
Shoot!

117
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,795
A clean, delicate shot

118
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,200
destroys an accurate one

119
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,957
You shoot to find yourself

120
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,589
l do it to shoot

121
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,308
Perfection is to lose yourself

122
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,035
and to lose yourself you need
to love

123
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:19,150
You don't love. You destroy, kill
and no one loves you

124
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,393
Because when you think you're
giving, you're really taking

125
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,748
l've given myself to her.
l told her everything

126
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,798
She's inside me

127
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,078
Her infinite love fills me

128
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:08,711
What l do and say is ordered
and blessed by her

129
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,755
l hate all that is mine

130
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,552
because it distances me from
her divine presence

131
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,351
Two are better than one,

132
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:34,799
because if they fall, one will
lift up his companion

133
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,308
When there is only one,
there is no one to lift him up

134
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,313
When l made this, l didn't
think it would be useful

135
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:59,396
l just tried to make it the best
way l possibly could

136
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,877
Take your gun again

137
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,833
My son wants to give you
one last chance

138
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,277
PROPHETS

139
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,796
l don't want you to go near him

140
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,230
Why do you follow us? Go away!

141
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:54,149
We don't need to take your gun
away. We trust you

142
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,679
You have a flute! We'll get to
know each other through music

143
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,878
You're disgusted at yourself.
You don't want to betray any more

144
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,190
Now you want to respect the law

145
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:39,318
Some give flowers.
Some, precious objects

146
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,234
You bring me your life as a gift

147
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,472
You are not afraid to die

148
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,508
This is why you are a
dangerous enemy

149
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,553
When you were 7 metres
from the rabbit run,

150
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:14,275
my rabbits started to die.
Now they're nearly all dead

151
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,554
Now that you're here,
not one will be left alive

152
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,476
l made it.
Feel how fine it is...

153
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,631
You can fire a shot

154
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:55,957
lt is all that l need.
A fatal shot

155
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,034
Shoot!

156
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,714
Which did you kill and
which did l kill?

157
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:21,000
This is yours: shot in the head.
This is mine: shot in the heart

158
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,717
The heart...the head...

159
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,993
A changing of places

160
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,991
lt is now time

161
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,836
Too much perfection is a mistake

162
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,791
You won! Don't leave me!

163
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:29,072
You'll be the best and l'll help
you! There's only one left!

164
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,433
Want to duel with me?

165
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,638
How will l do that?

166
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,831
l have no gun

167
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:19,715
l bartered the pistol for a
butterfly net

168
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,634
l must fight you with my hands

169
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,596
Fight! Fight!

170
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,110
Fight!

171
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:14,032
See? My net is more powerful
than your bullets

172
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:22,718
lf you shoot again, l'll reflect
the bullet directly into your heart

173
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:49,832
How can you win if l don't duel?

174
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,879
l have nothing

175
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,679
Even with a trap you couldn't have
taken anything from me

176
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,832
Yes, actually,
l could have taken your life

177
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,709
l don't care about my life

178
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,395
Now l'll show you

179
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,958
You lost

180
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,152
You won! You won!
You're the best!

181
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,429
l was poured out like water

182
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:02,115
and my bones were all detached

183
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:06,872
lt's like my heart shrivelled
inside my guts

184
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,914
My tongue cleaved to my palate

185
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,760
And they put me in the dust
of the dead

186
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:20,191
My God, my God,
why have you forsaken me?

187
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:23,718
Why are you so far from
my salvation

188
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,554
and from the voice of my lament?

189
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:30,793
My God, l call you by day
but you do not answer

190
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,157
l call by night and there is
no peace

191
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,838
Him or me

192
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:30,597
Show me your way,
your paths

193
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,958
Show me the way
of your truth

194
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:39,553
Because you are the God of my
salvation and l waited for you

195
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:43,353
You will show your sinners the way

196
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,797
You will put the humble
on the path of justice

197
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,117
PSALMS

198
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:50,150
l am not a god.
l am a man

199
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:53,789
How long have l been here?

200
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,435
When you got here,
l hadn't been born

201
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:02,510
l looked after you from infancy.
The old woman says you'll free us

202
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,557
Come

203
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,711
We've been prisoners in this
cave for many years

204
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:50,272
That's the only exit. To get there
we need to scale the walls

205
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:51,873
and many days

206
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:55,438
Outside there's the mountain
and a big village

207
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,592
They won't help us get out

208
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:02,470
We're deformed from continuous
incest. We disgust them

209
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:21,554
lt was difficult to bring me here.
Why did you do it?

210
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:24,435
The old woman knows

211
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:28,912
She sent us to find you.
Now she wants to see you

212
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,634
This is not my face!
This is not me!

213
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,678
l'll find money and dig a
tunnel in the mountain

214
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:00,949
The tunnel will unite the
village and this cave

215
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:04,795
When the tunnel is finished,
you'll finally be free

216
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,391
You'll get out of here

217
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:50,349
This is the big village

218
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:03,516
We should beg

219
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,672
See to my curls!

220
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,789
Paint my nails!

221
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:58,391
The cream

222
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:12,317
Fan

223
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:49,119
This pervert is looking
at my legs!

224
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:00,716
Help! He's forcing himself
on me!

225
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:10,799
You saw him kiss
me roughly!

226
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:18,519
Disgusting slave! How dare you?

227
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:21,997
Help, he's raping us!

228
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:41,750
Don't let him get away! Murderer!

229
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:48,754
Bring him here! Rapist!
You're really degenerate!

230
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,389
Get him! Get him!

231
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:58,316
Murderer! Murderer!

232
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:37,398
You think it's worthwhile for my
people to come here?

233
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,309
This is worse than the other

234
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:49,836
l'll keep digging

235
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:10,714
How many metres have we dug now?

236
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,079
There's more to go!

237
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:16,115
We've lost our public

238
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:25,320
Hey, monsters! Monsters, come here!
Come on, come here!

239
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,150
We'll pay you well

240
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:31,670
They're both dead

241
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:34,431
- Who died first?
- This one

242
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:36,989
He's the champion!

243
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:35,754
Protect us, Lord

244
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:39,235
Protect us, Lord

245
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,835
Protect us, Lord

246
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:46,390
Protect us, Lord

247
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:30,519
God loves us! God protects us!

248
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:34,916
lf we have faith, nothing
can happen to us

249
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:38,078
We must gamble with God

250
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:41,678
The stake is death

251
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:45,078
and who doesn't believe
in God will die!

252
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:51,236
Protect us, Lord

253
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:58,075
- Miracle!
- Miracle!

254
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:02,191
Protect us, Lord

255
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:05,790
Protect us, Lord

256
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:29,040
Miracle!

257
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:36,070
Protect us, Lord

258
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:51,631
Miracle!

259
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:05,596
Don't tremble, the safety's on

260
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:44,235
- Miracle!
- lt's a miracle!

261
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:56,873
Miracle!

262
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:02,957
APOCALYPSE

263
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:08,912
No one will come any more.
The circus is over. l'll go too

264
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,438
Come in!

265
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:56,953
As is the custom,
the League of Worthy Women,

266
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:01,479
after the monthly inspection,
congratulates your husbands

267
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,229
Everything's decent here

268
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:13,953
Want to earn money?
Come with me

269
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:20,274
Go down there

270
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:22,789
Come

271
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:49,195
Do the kissing number!

272
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:09,320
Now we want to see the sequel!
Come on, strip off!

273
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:51,834
l love you! They don't exist!
There's only you here

274
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:55,277
We're alone! Love me, please!

275
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:39,316
We can buy the dynamite and
keep on digging the tunnel

276
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:49,038
Why are you hiding?

277
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:05,798
l'm ashamed. Now l disgust you
and you'll abandon me

278
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:12,917
No, come with me

279
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:38,269
Tell him to marry us

280
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:46,229
Go on!

281
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:52,360
We're getting married, Father

282
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:35,279
No, you can't kill him!
He hasn't finished his work!

283
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:51,755
...and he promised to dig
the tunnel so we can be free

284
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:09,473
l'll wait till you finish the work.
Then l'll kill you

285
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:13,595
But l'll watch you day and night
so you won't escape

286
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:39,314
You'll never finish!
You're taking too long

287
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:46,078
lf you want us to hurry,
help us to finish

288
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:51,834
And if you want to finish
quickly...

289
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:56,716
help us to beg

290
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:25,759
This rock's too hard.
We've hit it a thousand times!

291
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:33,998
Only 1 ,000 times?

292
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:51,515
The pain must be unbearable

293
01:49:57,960 --> 01:50:02,317
My body feels pain. Not l

294
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:19,754
You'll never do it. That's enough!

295
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:37,469
You've done it!

296
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:41,349
- You've done it!
- Don't tell him! l'm not ready!

297
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:13,635
l can't kill my master
