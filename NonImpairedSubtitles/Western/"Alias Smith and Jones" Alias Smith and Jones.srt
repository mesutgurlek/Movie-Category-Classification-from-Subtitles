<i>NARRATOR:
Into the West came many men.</i>

2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,457
Some were good men
and some were bad men.

3
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,866
<i>Some were good men
with some bad in them.</i>

4
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:27,929
<i>And some were bad men
with some good in them.</i>

5
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:32,601
<i>This is the story
of two pretty good bad men.</i>

6
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,311
<i>Hannibal Heyes and Kid Curry.</i>

7
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:41,185
<i>Together, these gentlemen
substantially altered</i>

8
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,721
<i>the course
of America's frontier.</i>

9
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:48,625
<i>They did a lot to change
railroad schedules, too.</i>

10
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:51,128
<i>And in all the trains
and banks they robbed,</i>

11
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:53,357
<i>they never shot anyone.</i>

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,765
<i>This made our two Iatter-day
Robin Hoods very popular</i>

13
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,303
<i>with everyone but the
railroads and banks.</i>

14
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,507
<i>Because unlike Robin Hood,</i>

15
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:08,343
<i>Hannibal Heyes and Kid Curry robbed from the
rich and kept the money for themselves.</i>

16
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:12,479
<i>It was a good life,
but times were changing.</i>

17
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:17,285
<i>Safes were getting better, the
posses were getting bigger,</i>

18
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:20,318
<i>sheriffs were getting smarter,</i>

19
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:24,252
<i>and modern communications
made it only a matter of time</i>

20
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:28,861
<i>until they would be captured
and maybe even killed.</i>

21
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:36,137
Stand and deliver!

22
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,608
Who says so?
Kid Curry.

23
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:40,307
Hannibal Heyes.

24
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,955
AII right. Everybody out!
Move it, pronto!

25
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,424
Let's go, move it!

26
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,567
How're you boys coming
with that safe?

27
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,573
She's gonna blow
sky-high!

28
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,475
Take the dirt, folks!

29
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,240
Look out!

30
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:19,984
Pull her down, boys.

31
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,022
I'm Birdie Pickett.
I'm so...

32
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,917
How much dynamite
did you use, Kyle?

33
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,791
Every last stick of it.

34
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,296
For one little old safe?

35
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,662
This ain't no
little old safe.

36
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,559
This is a Brooker 202.

37
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,453
What's the delay?

38
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,518
Well, I'm sure
I don't know, ma'am.

39
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,389
Better go check
your fuse, Kyle.

40
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,123
I ain't going in there!

41
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,228
Listen, when the leader ofthe
gang tells him to do something,

42
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,738
don't he have to do it?

43
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,868
Yeah, that's my understanding.

44
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:54,504
But what makes you
such a great leader, Heyes,

45
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,946
is that you never tell
no man to do a thing

46
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,074
you wouldn't do yourself.

47
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,414
You wanna be leader?

48
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:02,953
After you.

49
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,896
Kyle got it wet.

50
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,565
Well, whose fault is that?

51
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,509
I warned you not to ford
that river, didn't I? Huh?

52
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:02,638
Oh, no.
No, you and your short cuts.

53
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,340
Don't get
proddy, Wheat.

54
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:09,187
Hey! Folks are getting restless.
They're starting to mutter.

55
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,846
Mutter what?

56
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,119
Oh, like, maybe you two
don't know what you're doing.

57
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,248
(SCOFFS)

58
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,591
Like if you can't even
blow up the safe,

59
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,995
maybe you ought to get in
some other line of work.

60
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,662
That kind of talk
could ruin us.

61
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,568
Well, I happen to agree with him.
Wheat...

62
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,200
Wasn't no offense meant, Kid.

63
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,766
None taken, Wheat.

64
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,905
Now, I wanna remind you boys that
we don't exactly have a Iot oftime,

65
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,643
so if you would just Iet Heyes here
have a few quiet minutes to work...

66
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,618
Oh, sure, sure.
Come on, Kyle.

67
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,090
(COUGHS)

68
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,225
I suppose
you boys are wondering

69
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:57,166
what a little old lady from Boston is
doing way out here in the Wild West.

70
00:05:57,224 --> 00:06:00,171
Ma'am, I wonder if you could
kind of keep your voice down.

71
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:03,001
My partner
has to hear the tumbler.

72
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,073
Tumblers? Oh, I know. But if
you don't mind an opinion,

73
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:13,047
I don't think that you
and your friend are cut out

74
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,312
for this sort ofthing.

75
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,217
Well, now,
wait a minute, ma'am.

76
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:17,778
Now, this ain't been
our best day.

77
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,619
MRS. PICKETT: I'm sure.

78
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:24,628
But I do thinkthat
you ought to read this.

79
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:28,322
What's this?
Some kind of religious tract?

80
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,894
Well, it may be the answer to
all of your problems, my dear.

81
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,532
Now, you just take it and read
it when you find the time.

82
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,405
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.

83
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,638
And now you had
better get back to work

84
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,737
because I see
your friends are frowning.

85
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,477
Uh...

86
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,683
It's no use.

87
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,620
This safe ain't human. lt'Il take
me two hours to get into it.

88
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,213
AII right, then,
let's make tracks.

89
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,156
This train's due
into Columbine right now.

90
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,820
Posse will be leaving out of
Columbine 10 minutes from now.

91
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,487
Lot oftruth in there.

92
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:03,134
Yeah, but there's $50,000
in this safe.

93
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,827
We ain't leaving it behind.

94
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,461
What are you suggesting
we do with it?

95
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,597
HEYES:
We're taking it with us!

96
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,677
When I said,
"Let's make tracks,"

97
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,812
that ain't exactly
what I had in mind.

98
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:27,017
That posse's gonna be real
grateful to Heyes, ain't they?

99
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,821
How'd you do it, Wheat?

100
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,759
Smarter.
But how?

101
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,458
That's for me to know
and you to find out

102
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:38,228
when I'm the leader
ofthis gang.

103
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,747
WHEAT: Heyes, why are we heading
up towards the mountains?

104
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,223
HEYES: So we can drop
the safe off a big one.

105
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,126
(ALL GRUNTING)

106
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:19,172
Ifthat don't bust her
wide open, nothing will.

107
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,075
Yeah, I hope you're right,
Heyes,

108
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,875
'cause, the way I figure it, we got
the short end of an hour left.

109
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,422
HEYES:
Gotta be here someplace.

110
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:36,560
Keep looking, fellas. I mean, you
know it's gotta be here. I mean...

111
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,656
We'll find it. Don't worry.

112
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:45,558
I mean, we pushed her from up there.
She's gotta be down here, right?

113
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,406
The way I figure it, Heyes,

114
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,343
you owe me and the boys
about $50,000.

115
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,514
Now, we ain't got
no time for talking, Wheat,

116
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,174
we only got
time for looking.

117
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,150
Understand?

118
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,153
Yahoo! Here she is, boys!
Here she is!

119
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,624
What? Is she open?

120
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,820
No, she's buried.

121
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,415
"Sure-fire, boys.
Can't miss, boys.

122
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,477
"Ifthis don't work,
nothing will, boys."

123
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:38,545
(SCOFFS)

124
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:42,024
Now, Wheat, you said you had
an idea better than Heyes'.

125
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,187
I figure me and the boys
are ready to back you up.

126
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,752
Yeah, right.
Yeah.

127
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,125
AII right, men.

128
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,065
Well, the first step
is to

129
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,474
dig up that safe.

130
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,101
Good idea!
Right!

131
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,645
Dig up the safe!

132
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,009
(EXCLAIMING)

133
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,580
Well, don't let it
eat at you, Heyes.

134
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,346
Maybe he don't have
no second step.

135
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:44,653
(ALL GRUNTING)

136
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,523
Get over there.

137
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:52,622
Wheat, may I remind you that
we ain't got too much time.

138
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,756
We already pushed
this 202 off a mountain,

139
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,232
and it didn't so much
as scratch her paint.

140
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,326
Heyes, listen, it's all in
the way you handle things.

141
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:02,134
Now, you dropped her into the mud.
I'm fixing to aim her on the rocks.

142
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:06,405
Mean, hard, pointed rocks. She'll
come apart Iike a two-bit barrel.

143
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,104
Wheat, may I point out...
We're ready, Wheat.

144
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,377
Just... I'm running
things now, all right?

145
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,342
AII right, boys,
let her go.

146
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,714
Well, could've been
a lot worse.

147
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,475
How?

148
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,052
Could've been my idea.

149
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,517
Sure making it easy.

150
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:58,818
Yup.

151
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,197
Maybe it's a trap.

152
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,033
You know, Iwasjust
thinking the same thing.

153
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:08,072
We better proceed
more cautious from here on.

154
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,704
They're awful smart.

155
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,900
No telling what that bunch
is up to.

156
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:41,666
Well, I guess that does it.

157
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:48,304
You two ain't just walking
away from all that money!

158
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:53,548
No, we're walking away from a posse.
Advise you to do the same.

159
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,677
I don't take advice,
I give it!

160
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,314
And I'm advising you two
to reconsider.

161
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:01,757
You walk away, we ain't gonna be obliged
to owe you no share in that money.

162
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,919
Well, that seems
fair enough, Wheat.

163
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,692
See you boys later. Wish you
all the Iuck in the world.

164
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,694
Be seeing you again,

165
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,733
if you don't
hang around here too long.

166
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,178
Let her go.

167
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:29,813
Heyes, what's amnesty?

168
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,611
Huh?

169
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,322
Where'd you get this?

170
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,159
Little old lady from Boston.

171
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,699
Said it could be the end
to all our troubles.

172
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:46,299
What's amnesty mean?

173
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,298
Well...

174
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,639
Well, what it means is there's more
chicken thieves, land grabbers,

175
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,203
and rag-picking penny stealers
around than there is Iawmen.

176
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,943
So if a man wants
to turn himself in,

177
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,212
governor might see fit
to wipe his slate clean.

178
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:03,185
"Might" see fit?

179
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,222
Depends on who you are
and what you done.

180
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:06,382
Oh.

181
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,758
Well, I don't suppose
we'd have a chance.

182
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,153
You don't suppose right.

183
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:17,795
Hey, good Iuck now!
You better hurry, boys!

184
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,138

"You better hurry, boys."

00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,785
Better hurry, boys.

CURRY: There's one thing
we gotta get, Heyes.

188
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:47,926
HEYES: What's that?

189
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,557

00:15:58,724 --> 00:15:59,862

(CLEARS THROAT)

195
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,508
What can I do for you?

196
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,648
Howdy, Lom.

197
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,758
Heyes.

198
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:27,557
Oh, Lom, no. Is that any way to
say hello after all these years?

199
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,624
Hello, you're under arrest,
and where's the Kid?

200
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:39,142
Ought to get a lock
for that side door, Lom.

201
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,518
Nice to see you, Lom.

202
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,451
Well, it ain't nice
to see you.

203
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,354
I'm gonna tell you straight
right now, both of you.

204
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:56,586
If you have a mind to pull
something here in my town,

205
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,357
you'd best be primed to walk
over my body doing it.

206
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,122
Lom, we're friends.

207
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,599
Were friends.

208
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,033
Oh, now, Lom.

209
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:09,267
We never held it against you. Sporting
a big tin star, big as a hog's head.

210
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,472
Coffee, Lom?
No, thanks.

211
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,806
Yeah, ru...

212
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:18,746
Well, you know, Lom, we still
think of you as one of us.

213
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,949
Well, what do you want?

214
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,028
What do you know
about this?

215
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,166
Amnesty?

216
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,839
That's a program the governor's
trying out to see if...

217
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:46,835
(CHUCKLES)

218
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,978
You ain't thinking of amnesty
for you two?

219
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:54,211
Oh, that's for cheap crooks
and small-time grifters.

220
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,415
Oh, well.

221
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,649
Can we help it if we're a
bit better at what we do?

222
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:03,285
You can't tell me the governor's
gonna penalize us for excellence.

223
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:05,056
And one thing's for sure.

224
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,324
Whoever does our talking is
gonna have to believe in us.

225
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:11,960
Does your... Does your talking?
You don't mean me?

226
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,833
Well, hey, Lom.

227
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:17,875
The only man we know who can look
the guv straight in the eye,

228
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,605
tell him an outlaw
can turn good, and mean it.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

230
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,081
It's agirl.

231
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,486
Okay, now, Lom,
you be careful.

232
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,454
LOM: Come in.

233
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,130
May I speak with you,
Sheriff?

234
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,957
Oh, hello, Miss Porter.

235
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,229
Isn't it kind of Iate for you
to be out by yourself?

236
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,272
Oh, I was working Iate.
I'm on my way home now, but...

237
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,774
Oh, I didn't realize that you were
right in the middle of something.

238
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,402
I ain't in the middle of nothing.
These are just a couple of...

239
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,879
Old, old friends.

240
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:58,938
Well, any friends
ofthe Sheriff's

241
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:01,747
are instantly put on my list
of preferred acquaintances.

242
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,255
Aren't you going to
introduce us, Lom? Huh?

243
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,013
Oh, sure.

244
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:12,886
May I present,
Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones.

245
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,254
This is Miss Porter
of Porterville.

246
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,131
Charmed, I'm sure.
Delighted, ma'am.

247
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,693
Mr. Smith. Mr. Jones.

248
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,100
Actually, Lom, what I came
to talk to you about was

249
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,302
we're handling a very large payroll
at the bank tomorrow and...

250
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,911
Oh, perhaps I should explain,
I'm running the local bank.

251
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,884
And I was thinking we ought to talk about
some additional security measures.

252
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,747
I'm sure we should.

253
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:41,423
You are the local banker,
ma'am?

254
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,153
In my father's absence, yes.

255
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,889
Well, I'II drop by the bank the first
thing in the morning, Miss Porter,

256
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,363
and look into your
security arrangements.

257
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,162
Oh, that would be fine, Lom.

258
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:53,795
Although I'm fairly confident
with our big new Brooker safe.

259
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,429
Brooker?
Brooker, ma'am?

260
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,132
HEYES: Not the Brooker 202?

261
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,870
No. The Brooker 404.

262
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,440
Oh...

263
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,275
Brooker 404.
404.

264
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,145
Well, you just
rest assured, ma'am.

265
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,414
There ain't a man in these
parts can open a Brooker 202,

266
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,148
let alone a 404.

267
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:14,916
Now, how is that, Mr. Smith, that
you know so much about safes?

268
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,921
Well, it's kind of in his
line of work, Miss Porter.

269
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,224
But the Brooker 404
is brand new!

270
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,197
I didn't know anybody knew
anything about them.

271
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:23,665
It is new to these parts,

272
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:28,069
but they've had one for some months
at the Mercantile Bank of St. Louis,

273
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,136
and the Farmer's Bank
at Fort Worth, too.

274
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,677
Mr. Smith, you've given
your secret away.

275
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,242
I have?

276
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:39,412
You are in banking!

277
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,343
Yes.

278
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,387
Yes, you could say that,
couldn't you?

279
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,989
Mr. Smith, given your choice,
would you pick a Brooker safe

280
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,753
or a Magnalock?

281
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,359
I'd pick either one.

282
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,992
Actually, I'm more
in the money end of it.

283
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,892
My partner, Mr. Jones, here,
is the security expert.

284
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:03,771
An expert? Right here in Porterville?
Well, ma'am...

285
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:07,709
Oh, Lom, now, you know how I've been
trying to prove myself while Daddy's away.

286
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,805
It's just that,
being only a woman, I...

287
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,948
I feel I need guidance.

288
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:19,616
Lom, do you think that we might
prevail upon your friends

289
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,022
to take an interest
in our little bank?

290
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:24,618
Well, I'm sure they'd do
just that, ma'am,

291
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,587
if they were to stay in town.

292
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:29,765
As it happens, they'll be
leaving real sudden Iike.

293
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,564
However, Lom, since
she is a friend of yours...

294
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,799
And since we do have some unfinished
business with you, Lom...

295
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,671
Then you will take a look
at our security systems?

296
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,574
Oh, with pleasure, ma'am.

297
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,442
First thing in the morning,
ma'am.

298
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,983
I know I'II be in good hands.

299
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,415
Good night.

300
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,953
Good night, Miss Porter.

301
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:54,013
(DOOR OPENS)

302
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,318
Good night.

303
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:57,483
(DOOR CLOSES)

304
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,131
So that's it.

305
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:03,463
AII this talk about amnesty
is just an excuse

306
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,593
for you to be here
while you set up the bank.

307
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:10,568
Lom, if you know one thing about me and
the Kid, you know our word is good!

308
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,870
We never come anywhere
near this town before

309
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:15,378
'cause we didn't want to cause
any trouble for you.

310
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:20,410
AII right, if you can't help
us now, okay, I understand.

311
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:24,280
You make our excuses to the lady, tell
her we had to leave town unexpected.

312
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,879
Let's go, Kid.

313
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:28,858
Wait, boys.

(SIGHS)

315
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,966
I guess I knew all along that
you stayed out of Porterville

316
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,661
just to keep my record clear.

317
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:42,739
I suppose one good turn
deserves another.

318
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:45,271
Then you'll do it?

319
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,506
You'll talk to the governor?

320
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,780
With all the heat he's been getting
from the banks and the railroads,

321
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:54,978
he might even thank me for coming up with
a way to put you two out of business.

322
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:56,718
When can you get started?

323
00:22:56,775 --> 00:23:00,052
No sense in waiting. I'II take
the 7:15 train in the morning.

324
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,090
AII right, Lom.
You're a good man.

325
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,253
Yeah, I told you.
I told you.

326
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,654
So long, Lom. Be seeing you.

327
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,491
We'll be waiting right here
for you when you get back.

328
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,395
You know, with your pockets loaded
full of you-know-what, huh?

329
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:44,866
Well, so long, Smith. So long, Jones.
AII right.

330
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,530
I expect you can stay out
oftrouble till I get back.

331
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,039
Listen, if anything happens,
my deputy's name is Harker.

332
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,665
He's a big blond fellow.

333
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,635
What a worrier.
What could happen?

334
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:10,426
Got about three more minutes to crack
this safe before the bank opens.

335
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:13,087
(SHUSHING) You can't rush
ajob Iike this.

(SIGHS)

337
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:41,383
Well, if you can't crack her, I
don't guess she can be cracked.

338
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:47,458
Well, it looks Iike you got
yourself a real safe safe, ma'am.

339
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,296
Well, I'm very grateful to you
for your efforts, both of you.

340
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:53,735
Our pleasure, ma'am,
and our business.

341
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,499
Oh, that's so apparent.

342
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:57,336
Are you satisfied,
Mr. Smith?

343
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:02,411
Yes, ma'am.
You got your money's worth.

344
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:05,708
Five tumbler,
sequential action.

345
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,776
But a good dynamiter
could blow it.

346
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:13,620
Well, he'd have to get through the steel
bars on our windows and our doors first.

347
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:19,992
Well, I wish we could continue
this discussion,

348
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:22,589
but if you'll excuse me,
I must open our doors.

349
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,739
HARKER: Hey, gents!

350
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,374
Don't make no move
toward your guns!

351
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:41,277
And who says so?
Me.

352
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,411
Acting Sheriff
Harker Wilkins.

353
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:47,688
AII right, you just step right on
in there, gentlemen. That's fine.

354
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,385
Yes, here.

355
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:54,761
Now, on official orders from
elected Sheriff Lom Trevors,

356
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,324
you are directed
to give me your firearms.

357
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,795
Go on. Unstrap them now.

358
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,746
That's fine, that's fine.
Thank you. Thank you kindly.

359
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:15,679
Thank you.

360
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:22,084
Oh, now, here. You just put that
right back where you got it from.

361
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:26,194
You best to tell him.

362
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,323
He don't put it back,
he's gonna get in big trouble.

363
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:34,461
Oh, you best
to put it back, Mr. Jones.

364
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:37,930
Hmm.

365
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,901
There. Thank you kindly.

366
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:52,017
Hey, Deputy, would you mind filling
in some ofthe spaces with words?

367
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,157
Yeah, well,
you men is on my list.

368
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,154
Your what list?

369
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,661
Well, my list
of known transients,

370
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:03,899
placed in myjurisdiction by Sheriff Trevors
to be enacted upon in his absence.

371
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:07,169
Transients being found
in possession of firearms

372
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,672
while under my
aforementioned jurisdiction,

373
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:14,871
which is in violation of Article One
ofthe Temporary Transients Act,

374
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:18,540
and makes them subject to immediate
arrest and imprisonment.

375
00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:20,140
This was Lom's idea?

376
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:21,742
Relax.

377
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,686
He's just trying to make sure
we stay out oftrouble, huh?

378
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,416
Oh, we're fine without a gun?
Uh-huh.

379
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,220
What other kind of
special rules you got?

380
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,727
Well, now there's Article Two,

381
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:35,128
which says that ifthere's
any trouble in the whole town,

382
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:37,793
that's from a busted window
to a throwed horseshoe,

383
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:42,202
that I am to pick up and
arrest all known transients.

384
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:43,938
(BOTH GROANING)

385
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,174
Hey, how many transients
you got on that list?

386
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,474
Two.

387
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:57,781
Oh, cheer up, Kid.

388
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,517
If it's worth having, it's
worth giving something up for.

389
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:02,217
Lom's only testing us.

390
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:05,792
Yeah, he gave us wings
and took away the sky.

391
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,354
Mr. Smith! Mr. Jones!

392
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:13,496
I'm sorry. We hadn't really
completed our discussions

393
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,095
when I had to break away.

394
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,969
Hadn't we?
No.

395
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,805
I could certainly
use you, in the bank.

396
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:21,805
You mean to work there?

397
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,408
Inside, ma'am?

398
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,345
But you don't have to make
your decision right now.

399
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:27,543
We'll take the jobs.
Huh?

400
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:31,220
Why not? And I for one
am not too proud.

401
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,950
Like Miss Porter says, it's
only till her Pa gets back.

402
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:36,618
And, well,
look at it this way.

403
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:38,684
We're strangers
in a strange town,

404
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,788
but inside a bank,
why, we'll be right at home.

405
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:45,198
Kind of keep our hands
in the... So to speak.

406
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:48,065
Well, I...
Ma'am, excuse me.

407
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,504
We're really gonna have to talk
this up between the two of us

408
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,337
if you don't mind.
Not at all.

409
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,673
I'm only thrilled you'll even
consider helping me out

410
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,735
in Daddy's absence.

411
00:28:56,802 --> 00:28:59,840
Could I possibly hope for an answer
by the close of business today?

412
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,885
Oh, oh, oh, of course, ma'am.

413
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,977
One way or another.
Yes, of course.

414
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,784
Thank you. Goodbye.
Goodbye.

415
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:11,721
You...

416
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:32,939
And I still say, why not?

417
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:35,417
You know, the sooner we grab off
ourselves some regularjobs,

418
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,511
the sooner we gonna get off
that list oftransients,

419
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:39,886
and the sooner we gonna get
our shooting irons back.

420
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:44,117
What's old Lom gonna think
we're up to, though,

421
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,160
if he hears we're
working in the bank?

422
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:51,830
I don't know about
that other one,

423
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:55,104
but I bet you a dollar
that's Kid Curry.

riding through Fort Griffin,

426
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,983
Then there's
the constant temptation,

427
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:11,145
which I ain't sure
I got the strength to resist.

428
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,519
Hey, you,
at the end ofthe bar.

429

wondering who it is you resemble.

Well, my mother mostly.

(SNORTS)

433
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,200
Well, now I see
why you don't wear a gun,

434
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,472
when you can shoot off
your mouth that way.

435
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,083
Well, you know
what we got here, Mr. Smith?

436
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:44,512
We got ourselves a walk-off.

437
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,978
No, no, no,
don't get started.

438
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:51,155
Walk-off?
I don't Iike that, mister.

439
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,491
And I don't even know
what it means.

440
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,759
Well, then, I'm gonna tell you.
No.

441
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:58,427
You see when the good Lord
was making men,

442
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,403
he got a whole bunch ofthem
all whomped up together.

443
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,066
And then he decided to knock
off for the rest ofthe day,

444
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:06,075
thinking he'd put
the brains in later.

445
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,243
But guess what happened?

446
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:11,972
A whole bunch ofthem critters
just upped and walked off

447

(MIMICKING INAUDIBLY)
before he ever got back.

448
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,687
And that's what we got here,
walk-off.

449
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,756
Don't you push him.
You can't back it up.

for my friend.

And also want you to be sure

452
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:34,502
that you keep on noticing
that he ain't wearing a gun.

for something, too.

We ain't got no chance now
that eyeballer knows who I am!

463
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,398
But he can't be sure. Not unless
you go and prove it for him!

464
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:18,540
Okay. We'll play it your way.

465
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,613
(SIGHS)

466
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:23,880
sir.

467
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:28,522
Me and my friend been
talking it over

468
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:35,859
and he'd Iike to apologize.
He'd what?

469
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:40,827
Yes, sir, that's a fact. I'd Iike
to apologize. I'm very sorry.

470
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,602
I've got a big mouth.

471
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:46,273
And no guts.

472
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,513
Yes, sir.

473
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,416
No guts.

474
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:00,585
You'd better be careful when you
stand up on your hind legs that way.

475
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:03,222
You might be confused
with something human.

476
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:06,623
Yes, sir.
I'II remember that.

477
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:10,224
You're right. He isn't the man
I thought he was.

478
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:13,660
But even so,
I don't Iike that face.

479
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,662
I'II be through here
tomorrow in the a.m.

480
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:19,671
You'd better make sure it ain't
around here for me to see.

481
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:23,045
Yes, sir.
lt'Il be missing.

482
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:27,981
(LAUGHING)

483
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,889
On the house, boys!

484
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,793
And my apologies.

485
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:48,363
AII my customers
ain't Iike him.

486
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,801
Local boy?
No.

487
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,339
He's ramrodding the 2U herd.

488
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,368
They're camped a couple miles
south of here.

489
00:33:57,502 --> 00:34:00,039
They'II be pushing them beeves
through here in the morning,

490
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:04,315
so all you gotta do is
stay hid till they're gone

491
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,353
and you won't get hurt.

492
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,815
That's all, huh?

493
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:09,948
(LAUGHS)

494
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,990
Well, it's decided.

495
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,392
We're taking those bank jobs

496
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,167
'cause I'm not going naked
one more day.

497
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,672
I don't know about that.

498
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,940
I don't know if a transient can
Iegally hold ajob in Porterville.

499
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:39,045
Well, he can't 'cause the minute
he's got a job, he ain't transient.

500
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,351
Which is what we stopped
being about 10 minutes ago.

501
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,017
You can ask Miss Porter.

502
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,992
So just give us our guns back.

503
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,323
We gotta get to work.

504
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,767
Well, till I get a definite
ruling from the Sheriff...

505
00:34:57,696 --> 00:35:01,542
Oh, here.
He got over to Capitol

506
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,406
and sent a message back. Had
something in it for you boys.

507
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,312
Sent it by telegraph, too.

508
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:14,913
Says here, "Tell Smith and
Jones everything looks good."

509
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:20,260
Now, I Iike to keep
my $100 bills in piles of 10,

510
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:23,856
and my $10 bills
in piles of 100.

511
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:26,129
And on my righÍ.

512
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:30,936
I'd Iike to have a pile
of $50 bills, 20 ofthem,

513
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:34,842
and 20 $50 bills on my left.

514
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:39,075
And the ones, you keep them...
What's the matter?

515
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,551
Oh, I don't know.

516
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:47,354
No, nothing, Mr. Pincus. I think
I gotta get some fresh air.

517
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:49,255
You look a little bilious.

518
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,418
Uh-huh.

519
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,639
(GROANS)

520
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:08,539
I've got green spots
in front of my eyes.

521
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,912
I've got fives and tens.
I don't know if I can take it.

522
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,814
Iwasjust thinking how natural
you looked behind them bars.

523
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:22,023
Leastwise, I ain't got time
to be tempted by Miss Porter.

524
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,825
Hello. Hello. Mayl
talk to you for a minute?

525
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:26,952
(CLEARS THROAT)

526
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,989
Mr. Jones, I wonder if we might
get together tonight for dinner?

527
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:32,758
To discuss security.

528
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:36,633
Well, I'm sorry, ma'am, but
I've other plans for tonight.

529
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:54,884
Who's that?

530
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,350
Me.

531
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,727
What do you want?

532
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:09,266
Well, first off, I'd Iike you to notice
there ain't nobody around to watch us now.

533
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:11,767
And I'd Iike you to notice
that I am wearing a gun.

534
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:14,205
You looking
for trouble?

535
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:15,266
No.

536
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:17,675
No, no trouble.

537
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,079
Just here to give you
a little piece of advice.

538
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,011
Don't take this herd
through Porterville.

539
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:26,251
Take the other road up
through Salt River.

540
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:28,291
You're given
the orders, mister.

541
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,053
I expect you can back them up.

542
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,425
There's two of us
and one of you.

543
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:34,464
That's two guns
against one.

544
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,226
That don't hardly seem fair.

545
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,799
Yeah, it's fair.

546
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:42,004
You see, this gun of mine
shoots two bullets at one time.

547
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,006
Huh? Now, what's that
supposed to mean?

548
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:45,969
Just what I said.

549
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:48,333
Here's one.

550
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,113
That's the other one.

551
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:57,575
That's two.

552
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:07,452
Get the idea?

553
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,132
Yes, sir.

554
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:18,033
We'll be going
by way of Salt River.

555
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,108
Thought you might.

556
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:26,647
Good night, boys.

557
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:38,788
Well, you can sleep easy.

558
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:43,628
Them boys ain't gonna be driving
that herd through town after all.

559
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:46,602
You didn't go up...
Oh, no, no, no, no.

560
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,669
No, Ijust suggested
a safer road.

561
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:52,332
So all our troubles
are over.

562
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,261
I don't Iike it.

563
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,193
Bank sits right there
next to Sheriff's office.

564

I wish Heyes was here
to think it out.

565
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:31,603
If I couldn't figure it out better than him
any day of the week, I'd just plum quit.

566
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:35,307
Tomorrow morning, we'll just
take that little bank

567
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,944
without Hannibal Heyes
and the Kid.

568

(CLEARING THROAT)
AII right, now.

569
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,481
We're all gonna
just walk in there,

570
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:07,140
looking innocent and normal.

571
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,253
Well, anyway, we're all
just gonna walk in.

572
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:19,261
And I'm gonna go first.

573
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:21,364
I'm gonna sashay
right up to the teller

574
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,127
and I'm gonnatell him to fill
this bag up full of money.

00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:29,370
Uh, rest of you,

576
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:33,698
you... Listen,
why don't you just

577
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:36,109
stand around,
ready to cover me

578
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,147
in case we have to
shoot our way out?

579
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:42,244
Ain't you nervous, Wheat?
Huh?

580
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,247
Well, you've never done
first bandit before.

581
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:47,384
Who's nervous?
I ain't nervous.

00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:34,399
Don't move and don't holler,
'cause this is a stickup.

you doing back there?

00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,586
One thing I ain't doing
is getting robbed.

585
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:54,017
Put that gun away.

586
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:55,856
0h, yeah?

587
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:58,093
Just read that.

588
00:41:58,149 --> 00:41:59,890
Why do I have
to read that?

589
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:03,232
I wrote it!
Now, you get out of here.

590
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:06,369
Now, wait just a minute.

591
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:08,062
Do you mean to say
that you're...

592
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,139
That you're
Iegally working here?

593

Yes, I am.

594
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:19,775
Then you ain't got no right
to tell me not to rob it.

as a friend

00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:42,087
Well, yeah.

619
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:44,132
Now, we'd have put in
for you, too,

620
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:45,633
but we didn't know
where you were.

621
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:49,097
As soon as we get it, it's a cinch
for you and all the rest ofthem.

622
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:53,167
'Cause... Well, we're much
bigger crooks than you are.

623
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:55,936
You really think
we got a chance?

624
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,708
Sure, and tell you what.
You take the boys,

625
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,544
you go Iay Iow
for a couple days.

626
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:03,180
Well, go over
to Salt River.

627
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:05,016
And then, as soon as
we get the good word,

628
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:07,215
we'll bust over on
and tell you.

629
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:09,516
Ain't that gonna be
a nice surprise?

630
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:14,325
The happy end
to seven sorry lives of crime.

631
00:44:15,253 --> 00:44:17,460
Glad you see
the advantage, Wheat.

632
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:19,058
Go on out there
and tell the boys.

633
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:21,535
Right, right.

634
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:23,970
We'll be waiting
for the word.

635
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:25,371
Yeah.

636
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:46,751
Well, what'd they say?

637
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:48,125
What are they up to?

638
00:44:49,954 --> 00:44:52,332
They're fixing to rob
the bank without us.

639
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:16,085
That man you were
talking to

640
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,853
and those other men,
what did they want?

641
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,428
CURRY: Well, they're just
looking for work, ma'am.

642
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,858
Poor devils, we told them
to try Salt River.

643
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:27,532
Oh, well, they certainly
do seem grateful.

644
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:31,930
By the way, ma'am.

645
00:45:31,996 --> 00:45:34,567
Sorry I couldn't take you up
on that dinner last night.

646
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:36,274
But I am free tonight.

647
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,145
How about you and me
doing the town?

648
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:40,809
Why, I'd love to.

649
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:43,145
Come on.

650
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,881
Now, wait. What's the idea rousting
a man out of bed Iike that?

651
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:47,889
You'll see.
Come on, come on.

652
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:49,885
What, now?

653
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,993
Just...
Just wait a minute.

654
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:20,248
Miss Porter,
can you get home by yourself?

655
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:21,379
Well, I usually do, but...

656
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,426
Well, then I'II be saying good
night to you now. Sorry, ma'am.

657
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,620
Never mind.

658
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,063
Hey, what's the trouble?

659
00:46:32,857 --> 00:46:34,928
You'll see. Come on.

660

(MUSIC PLAYING)

661
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:54,315
Look at them.

662
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:55,516
Give me a good one.

663
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,252
Okay.
A pair of eights good?

664
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,659
So, what's wrong with them?
Who are they?

665
00:46:59,717 --> 00:47:01,196
Transients.

666
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:04,096
Listen, they was over to the bank
this morning looking for work.

667
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,761
And don't you deny it because
I've got a full report.

668
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,235
Who's denying it?

669
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:10,033
We told them to go over
to Salt River.

670
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:11,437
Yeah, but they didn't do it.

671
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:13,105
Come here.

672
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:17,205
Bartender here tells me
they've been sitting

673
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:19,305
right in that spot
for 14 hours.

674
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:21,873
Well, that doesn't make it
our responsibility.

675
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:24,545
Yeah, but I got a feeling
that you know who they are.

676
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:25,780
What?

677
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:29,450
(MUSIC STOPS)

678
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,517
I said.

679
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:36,430
I got a feeling
that you know who they are.

680
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:37,522
Yeah, how come?

681
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:38,931
Well, 'cause
two oftheir horses

682
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,468
got the same brand
on them as yours have.

683
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:42,965
Now...

684
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:45,166
We bought them broomtails
off a herd

685
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:46,731
must have been 2,000 strong.

686
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:49,403
Now, it's just likely
somebody else bought a couple.

687
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,238
Yeah, maybe. Yeah, but,
they're still transients.

688
00:47:53,304 --> 00:47:55,341
And as such,
is subject to all the rules

689

and regulations
applying to same.

690
00:47:57,742 --> 00:48:02,054
So, I got to go in there
and take their guns.

691
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,797
He's about to get
his head blowed off.

692
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,607
Well, now, boys, I'II just
have to take your guns

693
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,807
until you decide
to ride out of town.

694
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,383
Where did you hear that?

695
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:34,946
Special rules
and regulations

696
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:38,323
pertaining to the
Temporary Transients Act.

697
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:41,591
And in this town, you boys
is knowed as transients.

698
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:43,427
Well, Kid.

699
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:46,093
Looks Iike it's time
for us to stand up

700
00:48:46,157 --> 00:48:48,194
and be counted
on his side ofthe Iaw.

701

Let's go.

702
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:52,534
Transients?

703
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:57,068
Sounds Iike a hanging offense
if ever I heared one.

704
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:58,204
0h. no. no, no.

705
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,010
Nothing serious
Iike that at all.

706
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:02,107
Just means I got to
take your guns.

707
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:07,848
(CLEARS THROAT) Oh, I guess...
lfthem's the rules,

708
00:49:07,912 --> 00:49:09,755
I guess we didn't
know the rules.

709
00:49:09,847 --> 00:49:12,293
Well, we'd be more than
happy to oblige, Sheriff.

710
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,022
That's all there is to it.
You'll see.

711
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:16,825
Thank you.
Thank you kindly, gentlemen.

712
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:19,197
There we are.
Thank you very kindly.

713
00:49:19,857 --> 00:49:23,430
There, now. You see there? Transients
ain't necessarily hostile.

714
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:26,964
Hmm?

715
00:49:32,937 --> 00:49:35,577
I thought you was gonna
wait over at the Salt River.

716
00:49:35,673 --> 00:49:38,586
What difference does it make,
as long as we're waiting?

717
00:49:39,043 --> 00:49:40,488
Oh, I don't know.

718
00:49:40,778 --> 00:49:43,657
But do you have to do it right here?
Right out in public?

719
00:49:48,886 --> 00:49:51,093
AII right,
I'II tell you the truth.

720
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:55,193
We just about busted.

721
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:58,235
And me and my horse is
just plum stove in.

722
00:49:59,263 --> 00:50:02,506
Those few miserable dollars
Iying out there on that table,

723
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,476
that's all the cash we've got
in the world between us.

724
00:50:05,803 --> 00:50:06,907
So?

725
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:09,474
So we can't...

726
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:12,150
We can't afford
no place to stay.

727
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:15,521
But you see,
if we just sit here

728
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:18,492
passing the same few
miserable dollars

729
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:20,187

every now and then, well,

731

we can't get throwed out.

732
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:30,604
And we have got
a roof over our heads.

733
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:33,437
Just as long as we don't
let no one else in the game

734
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:36,637
who might walk off
with what little we got.

Yeah.

don't be so down, you know.

Yeah, well, we're just
sitting here waiting.

741
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:51,584
AII right. Okay.

Yes, sir.

It's them transients. They're still
sitting around that poker table.

About 22 hours now.

No, ain't never been
more than $12 in the pot.

749
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:38,720
And it look Iike
they discourage new money.

750
00:53:39,483 --> 00:53:40,985
I can't figure that out.

751
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,327
Well, maybe
they're waiting for someone.

752
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:45,161
Or got nothing better
to do.

they're staying put.

tonight,

gents. So we just...

777
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,727
Oh, listen, Mr. Deputy.
Mmm-hmm?

778
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:03,999
You wouldn't mind,
would you,

779
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:05,631
if we just have ourselves
maybe just one little

780
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:08,404
extra hand of poker before we left town?
I mean, would you?

781
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:11,378
Oh, I reckon not. You boys sure
have been cooperative and all.

782
00:56:11,435 --> 00:56:13,210
Yeah, of course, I'II have
to take my leave of you.

tell that Sheriff,

00:56:19,076 --> 00:56:23,218
as far as we're concerned, he can just
leave you in charge any old time.

00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:26,023
Well, now, thank you, gents.
Thank you, yes.

00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:27,892
That's fine.
Thank you, Sheriff.

Thank you, Sheriff.

790
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:34,799
They're a fine bunch
of fellows there.

I mean, if you ain't
got that amnesty?

800
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:07,129

have our guns, just in case.

a point there, Heyes.

out oftrouble for 12 months,

931
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,523
you can do it forever.

932
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:01,319
Then you got it,
the whole thing.

933
01:12:01,384 --> 01:12:03,762
Fresh start,
clean bill of health, amnesty.

934
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:07,893
So, all we've got to do is just
stay out of trouble for one year.

935
01:12:08,758 --> 01:12:10,635
But we'll still be wanted.

936
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:12,969
We'll still be blamed for
everything that goes wrong.

937
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:14,633
We'll still be
the same men we was

938
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:16,677
before you talked
to the governor?

939
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:19,905
That's true.
But it's only for 12 months.

940
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:22,413
You can do it, boys.
I'm sure you can.

941
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:24,650
Just Iike you stayed
out oftrouble

942
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:27,313
for the last few days
right here in Porterville.

943
01:12:28,144 --> 01:12:30,317
Now, that wasn't so hard,
really, was it?

944
