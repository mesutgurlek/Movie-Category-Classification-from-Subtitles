Don't you give me the "soldier
going off to war" speech.

I seen that look as

Typhus is a bitch, isn't it?

You know, this is just a wooden box.

You shouldn't have let me kill you over it.

You remember over by the cemetery,

You know, you genuinely believed

that your God was gonna
protect you from the typhus.

206
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:48,259
So I figured I was gonna win both ways.

207
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:52,681
Either you would somehow impossibly survive

208
00:15:52,682 --> 00:15:55,900
and then I'd have proof
that your God exists or...

You'd end up just as you are now.

you've brought this down on me.

Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

So, your God should just
strike me down right here.

Is it fear or distaste?

Might I ask where you practiced?

I don't practice. I just do.

225

My Father was a practitioner.

226
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:57,546
I learned from watching him.
