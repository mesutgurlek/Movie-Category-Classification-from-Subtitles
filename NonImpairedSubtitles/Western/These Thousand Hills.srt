1
00:02:58,738 --> 00:03:00,706
Here comes the boss.

2
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,775
It's about time.

3
00:03:16,188 --> 00:03:19,885
- Any coffee left?
- Sure, boss, plenty. Help yourself.

4
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,297
Coffee?

5
00:03:25,398 --> 00:03:28,094
Finished branding the cattle
and got the horses all shod, Ram.

6
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,498
Good.

7
00:03:30,603 --> 00:03:34,164
This is Lat Evans from Pendleton.
He's coming along.

8
00:03:39,211 --> 00:03:41,941
Never seen a trail boss yet
could remember a name.

9
00:03:42,048 --> 00:03:46,382
- Mine's Carmichael.
- I remember the name all right. It's the face that throws me.

10
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,013
The cook here goes by
the name of Sally.

11
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:53,956
- How do you do?
- Just don't kick no dust into my makin's.

12
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,029
And don't bellyache about the grub.
And don't call me Sally.

13
00:03:57,129 --> 00:03:59,290
My handle's Jacob Schmidt.

14
00:03:59,398 --> 00:04:02,492
- All right.
- I'm Godwin.

15
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:05,399
Howdy.

16
00:04:07,306 --> 00:04:10,935
- Tom Ping.
- How do?

17
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,443
- You a rider?
- Well, I ain't walkin'.

18
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:16,447
We got 40 broncs to bust.

19
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:18,881
Mr. Butler...

20
00:04:18,984 --> 00:04:21,384
which pays better,
bronc-bustin' or wranglin'?

21
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:24,556
Bronc-bustin'.

22
00:04:24,657 --> 00:04:28,093
- I didn't come all this way
for a job that pays less.

23
00:04:30,429 --> 00:04:33,330
Well, then you'd better unsaddle that mule
and pick one of the string.

24
00:04:33,432 --> 00:04:35,696
- You'll need a horse.
- Sure.

25
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,464
<i>Hold up, boys.</i>

26
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,374
<i>Oh, I'll get the saddle.
You can shake out your rope.</i>

27
00:04:50,483 --> 00:04:52,883
Thanks.

28
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:55,977
<i>Some of them are pretty rough.
Sure you want to try one?</i>

29
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:59,421
Sure. Can't do no more
than pile me.

30
00:05:00,493 --> 00:05:02,791
Give us a hand, Hunter.

31
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:06,827
That big black
with the strip- Sugar-

32
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,900
<i>he'll take a heap ofbreaking.</i>

33
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:13,495
<i>Or that sorrel.
Which will it be?</i>

34
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:20,168
I reckon I'll catch up
the big black?

35
00:05:22,848 --> 00:05:24,839
You gentle that snorter
and he's yours.

36
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,581
Watch it. Easy, boy. Easy.

37
00:06:01,687 --> 00:06:05,088
Steady. Steady.
Steady, boy. Steady.

38
00:06:05,191 --> 00:06:07,487
Easy, boy. All right.

39
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,304
Steady! Steady, now.

40
00:06:19,405 --> 00:06:22,306
Push him! Hard!

41
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,944
Hold it now, Sugar.
Hold it!

42
00:06:57,576 --> 00:06:59,703
<i>Hey, cowboy!</i>

43
00:06:59,812 --> 00:07:02,940
<i>- Attaboy!
- Yoo-hoo! Ah-ha-ha!</i>

44
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:07,180
Ride him, Sugar!

45
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:17,119
Look out, boy!

46
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,857
<i>Got him going down!</i>

47
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:22,331
<i>Keep on him! Keep on!</i>

48
00:07:22,434 --> 00:07:25,995
Hey, kid, what are you doing?
Look out!

49
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:28,073
<i>What are you doing?</i>

50
00:07:28,173 --> 00:07:30,698
<i>You get that
crazy horse on out ofhere!</i>

51
00:07:30,809 --> 00:07:32,970
<i>Look out!</i>

52
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,638
- Why, that thing-
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

53
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:38,376
<i>- Hyah!
- Hang on there!</i>

54
00:07:38,484 --> 00:07:41,385
Oh, doggone!

55
00:07:49,662 --> 00:07:51,653
Ouch!

56
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:55,359
- Nice ride.
- You sure gentled him down.

57
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:57,435
You broke yourself
a good horse there.

58
00:07:57,536 --> 00:07:59,527
And ruined a good mulligan stew.

59
00:07:59,638 --> 00:08:01,606
Well, the bronc job's yours, Lat.

60
00:08:01,707 --> 00:08:03,902
Mr. Butler...

61
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:06,443
what'd the pay be for both jobs?

62
00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:08,775
- Both?
- Yeah, I could do both.

63
00:08:08,881 --> 00:08:10,872
Fighting broncs and wrangling?

64
00:08:10,983 --> 00:08:13,508
You won't be getting much sleep
between here and Fort Brock.

65
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,883
I can't afford much sleep yet.

66
00:08:15,988 --> 00:08:18,513
Don't you think I could do it?

67
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:22,116
Sure. Why not? Sleep when you're old.
That's what my pappy said.

68
00:08:52,224 --> 00:08:54,715
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

69
00:09:16,715 --> 00:09:19,343
<i>- Hyah!
- There's some strays out there.</i>

70
00:09:19,451 --> 00:09:21,419
Come on. Hyah!

71
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:37,265
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

72
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:40,930
- Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
- Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

73
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,133
Ho!

74
00:09:44,243 --> 00:09:47,940
That horse can sure fly.

75
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,071
- Whew!
- I wasn't even pushing him.

76
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,675
Oh, I don't know
why I don't steal for a living.

77
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:55,845
That's what the fella in jail said.

78
00:09:55,954 --> 00:09:58,684
How do you think all those big ranches
got started? Honest?

79
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,157
- How did they?
- By stealing horses.

80
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,956
Yeah, a fella down in Gold Creek
once showed me how.

81
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:08,226
All you need is a jackknife or a hot iron,
and you just change the brand.

82
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,824
There must be a way
to get rich without stealing.

83
00:10:10,936 --> 00:10:13,131
That's what the fella
in the poorhouse said.

84
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:23,209
Come on, Lat.
It's your watch.

85
00:10:23,315 --> 00:10:25,306
- What time is it?
- Midnight.

86
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,511
Won't be long now.

87
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,555
Good-bye, cows.
Hello, Fort Brock.

88
00:10:31,657 --> 00:10:33,648
"What's yours?" they'll ask.

89
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,489
And I'll say,
"Light, dark or a redhead."

90
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:39,530
Did you ever hunt wolves?

91
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:42,395
- Why?
- I was listening to Chico talk.

92
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:45,402
He made a thousand dollars in one winter,
just out of wolf hides.

93
00:10:45,504 --> 00:10:47,563
That's a hard way to make a living.

94
00:10:47,673 --> 00:10:49,732
Is there an easy way?

95
00:10:49,842 --> 00:10:52,276
I ain't afraid of hard work.

96
00:10:52,377 --> 00:10:54,402
I just don't want to die poor.

97
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:56,504
You lived poor, is that it?

98
00:10:56,615 --> 00:11:01,018
My old man owned a ranch
along the Willamette.

99
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,212
Went broke.

100
00:11:03,322 --> 00:11:06,519
Hard times.
That's all I remember.

101
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,752
I don't want to end up like he did.

102
00:11:08,861 --> 00:11:13,730
A failure, hiding behind the Bible,
pretending money isn't important.

103
00:11:13,832 --> 00:11:18,098
- Hate the old man?
- Naw, I-

104
00:11:18,203 --> 00:11:21,900
Pa just couldn't look a fact in the face.
That's all.

105
00:11:22,007 --> 00:11:24,032
Me, I'm different.

106
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,269
I'm gonna get me a ranch...

107
00:11:26,378 --> 00:11:29,472
and I'm gonna make it work,
no matter what.

108
00:11:34,386 --> 00:11:37,082
How about it, Tom?
Just one winter huntin' wolves...

109
00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:39,953
and we'll have more and quicker money
than six months on the trail.

110
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:43,824
You kill a buffalo, then you
poison the meat with strychnine.

111
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:47,421
Then you wait till the wolf that
feeds on it dies of the cramps.

112
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:49,558
Mm-mmm.

113
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,796
It's quick money, kid,
but it's dirtier.

114
00:11:52,905 --> 00:11:55,169
- What's dirty about it?
- Not me.

115
00:11:55,274 --> 00:11:57,834
I ain't gonna spend a winter
freezing my tail.

116
00:11:57,943 --> 00:11:59,934
You'd best find yourself
another partner.

117
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:02,013
<i>Will you two coyotes shut up?</i>

118
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:04,275
<i>- We're changing watch.
- Every time they spit...</i>

119
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:07,511
<i>- they gotta make a party of it.
- Eh.</i>

120
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:06,539
I owe you two, Carmichael,
and you know it.

121
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:12,046
<i>- Hey, Fatty, any gals around?
- Some.</i>

122
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,812
Lat, Fatty here says
they got some gals in town.

123
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,252
<i>Let's you and me go calling, huh?</i>

124
00:13:17,356 --> 00:13:20,917
Aw, women.
Is that all you think about?

125
00:13:21,026 --> 00:13:23,017
My mind naturally goes that way.

126
00:13:23,128 --> 00:13:26,325
It ain't gone far.

127
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:29,366
- Thirst comes first.
- I'd cut off a yard of them whiskers.

128
00:13:29,468 --> 00:13:33,905
My old pappy always said, "Never grow
on your face what grows on your tail."

129
00:13:34,006 --> 00:13:37,066
Yeah, your pappy would.

130
00:13:37,175 --> 00:13:40,110
Howdy, gents.

131
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,710
- Turpin show up?
- No,Jehu.

132
00:13:43,815 --> 00:13:46,249
Well, that's today for you.

133
00:13:46,351 --> 00:13:49,047
I can remember back when a man's word
meant something.

134
00:13:49,154 --> 00:13:52,590
He didn't say one thing
and do another.

135
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:55,785
I'm sorry, gents.
I didn't mean to bust up your party.

136
00:13:55,894 --> 00:13:58,920
- Have a drink.
- We were just talking women.

137
00:13:59,031 --> 00:14:02,523
Women?
Well, that's a limited subject.

138
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:05,262
Anybody here talk horses?

139
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,565
A little. Why?

140
00:14:07,673 --> 00:14:11,200
Well, a fella named Turpin had himself
a speedy filly, or so he said.

141
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:15,643
I came in from my ranch to race him,
but he scared out it seems.

142
00:14:15,747 --> 00:14:18,272
I got an Indian plug
I'll bet against all comers.

143
00:14:18,383 --> 00:14:20,749
Gold or greenbacks.
Even money.

144
00:14:20,852 --> 00:14:22,979
Name your figure and the day.

145
00:14:27,926 --> 00:14:29,917
Oh, well.

146
00:14:30,028 --> 00:14:31,996
Palaver don't get the chores done.

147
00:14:33,765 --> 00:14:37,098
- So long, you gents.
- Say, w-wait a minute.

148
00:14:37,202 --> 00:14:39,170
What kind of a horse
has he got, Fatty?

149
00:14:39,271 --> 00:14:41,432
<i>- It's an "Appaloosie."
- Fast?</i>

150
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,508
Well, nobody ain't beat him yet.

151
00:14:43,608 --> 00:14:46,076
Well, gents?

152
00:14:50,248 --> 00:14:52,682
We got a little old horse
can run pretty good.

153
00:14:52,784 --> 00:14:56,242
<i>- Where's your animal?
- Outside.</i>

154
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,322
Oh, that big bronc
I saw coming in?

155
00:14:58,423 --> 00:15:00,357
That's right.

156
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:03,587
- Who's ridin' him?
- Our boy here.

157
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,663
How about it, Lat? Game?

158
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:13,367
Come on, Lat.
You can't weasel out.

159
00:15:13,472 --> 00:15:15,838
If I ride, will you go wolfing
with me come winter?

160
00:15:15,941 --> 00:15:17,966
Yeah, sure, kid. Anything.

161
00:15:18,076 --> 00:15:21,045
- You swear?
- On a stack of Bibles.

162
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:24,673
All right.

163
00:15:24,783 --> 00:15:27,547
Well, gents, it's your money.
What are the bets, boys?

164
00:15:27,652 --> 00:15:30,382
- Six hundred yards around one turn.
- I got a hundred dollars.

165
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:32,480
<i>- Same here.
- Me too.</i>

166
00:15:32,591 --> 00:15:34,786
<i>- The rest of you as reckless?
- "Recklesser". Double or stone broke.</i>

167
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:39,057
And what about you, rider?
You bettin', or did your money get scared?

168
00:15:44,503 --> 00:15:48,633
- Fifty?
- Fifty is right. Take down their names, Fatty.

169
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,732
<i>Don't cry in your whiskey, boys.</i>

170
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:12,488
Hi. Hello, fellas.
How are you?

171
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:17,400
Warmed up?

172
00:16:17,502 --> 00:16:19,493
We haven't agreed on a starter.

173
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,903
- It'll be a fair start.
- All right.

174
00:16:27,846 --> 00:16:31,873
That Injun jockey won't weigh 80 pounds
with his tepee throwed in.

175
00:16:31,983 --> 00:16:35,248
Yeah. Well, I think
I'd better shuck the saddle.

176
00:16:35,353 --> 00:16:37,617
Boy, I sure wish
this course was longer.

177
00:16:37,722 --> 00:16:41,055
<i>There's a lot of money riding on you, boy.
Just keep thinking of that.</i>

178
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:44,424
- Now, don't go wide at the turnaround.
- All right.

179
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:46,759
All right. Let's get started.

180
00:16:46,865 --> 00:16:49,891
Out of the way, folks.

181
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:53,960
Move back from the course, folks.

182
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:07,378
Go!

183
00:17:57,469 --> 00:17:59,096
Come on, Sugar!
Come on!

184
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,682
<i>He's gonna fall!</i>

185
00:18:36,308 --> 00:18:38,276
Tom!

186
00:18:42,681 --> 00:18:45,377
- Tom!
- I oughta bust his head open!

187
00:18:45,483 --> 00:18:47,348
Dirty, soft-belly Indian!

188
00:18:47,452 --> 00:18:51,149
- That was the foulest race I ever saw run!
- Get your hands off me.

189
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,247
<i>- The bronc won.
- Who says so?</i>

190
00:18:53,358 --> 00:18:55,952
I do,Jehu.

191
00:18:57,629 --> 00:19:01,258
- Oh, Mr. Conrad.
- Trick and all, this boy took it.

192
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:04,233
Yippee!

193
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:34,455
Anything I can do for you, Miss Callie?

194
00:19:34,566 --> 00:19:36,932
No, thanks, Happy.
Nothing at all.

195
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:43,739
- Fifteen dollars.
- Call.

196
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,276
<i>Hey, Lat, I got a big run
ofluck going here.</i>

197
00:19:55,387 --> 00:19:59,153
Come on over.
Let it go, baby.

198
00:19:59,257 --> 00:20:01,987
Yeah! That does it.

199
00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:05,392
Hey,Jen, I want you to meet
my partner Lat- Lat Evans.

200
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:08,227
He's cute, even when
he ain't on a horse.

201
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,961
How about finding
a partner for my partner?

202
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:13,799
Sure.

203
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:16,635
Come on.
Let's have a drink.

204
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,484
Stylish place.

205
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:30,247
Howdy, boys.
Fran's my name, and fun's my failin'.

206
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,516
- What are you gonna drink?
- What's the best in the house?

207
00:20:32,624 --> 00:20:36,151
- Champagne.
- Well, like the fellow said, "No fools, no fun."

208
00:20:36,261 --> 00:20:38,252
- We'll have a bottle.
- Happy...

209
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:41,161
bring a bottle of champagne
for these gentlemen, and hustle it up.

210
00:20:41,266 --> 00:20:44,360
There's a nice table for you right over there.
Make yourselves at home.

211
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:46,596
And if you need help, holler.

212
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,639
I'll bring it to the table, gents.

213
00:20:49,741 --> 00:20:51,709
<i>- Hey, Ram, how you doing?
- Hey, Tom.</i>

214
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,176
- Howdy, boys.
- Hi, Tom.

215
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:56,975
- Tom, you ain't going back on our deal, are ya?
- What deal?

216
00:20:57,082 --> 00:20:59,346
Well, wolfing.
You're not going back on your word?

217
00:20:59,451 --> 00:21:01,544
Well, I said yes once, didn't I?

218
00:21:01,653 --> 00:21:03,644
Anybody knows me,
once is enough.

219
00:21:03,755 --> 00:21:06,349
Come on.
Let's have some fun.

220
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:09,450
This is Callie. Lat, Tom.

221
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,995
- How do you do?
- I saw you ride today.

222
00:21:12,097 --> 00:21:15,123
- Oh, did you?
- I was afraid you'd been hurt.

223
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:17,201
Nah, Sugar kicked him
in the head.

224
00:21:17,302 --> 00:21:19,998
That's the only safe place to kick a wrangler.

225
00:21:20,105 --> 00:21:22,972
- Champagne, gents.
- Oh, look at that.

226
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:27,204
- Mm-mmm.
- Well, here's to- to Albert Gallatin Evans.

227
00:21:27,312 --> 00:21:30,247
Hadn't been for him, we wouldn't
have had the pleasure of knowing you...

228
00:21:30,348 --> 00:21:32,748
'cause we'd have been broke.

229
00:21:32,851 --> 00:21:35,149
- Champagne?
- Yeah.

230
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,915
I ordered a case once in New Orleans.
Now, there's a town.

231
00:21:38,022 --> 00:21:40,650
Oh, they got nothing in New Orleans
they don't have right here.

232
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:43,090
And it's a lot closer.

233
00:21:43,194 --> 00:21:46,823
- Hear your outfit's pulling out tomorrow.
- The rest of'em are. Not us.

234
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,899
What do you boys aim to do?

235
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,366
Well, first we're gonna
finish this champagne.

236
00:21:51,469 --> 00:21:53,664
- And then, uh-
- Oh-ho-ho. Ain't he awful?

237
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:57,229
- I could use a rider like you.
- No, thanks.

238
00:21:57,342 --> 00:22:00,072
- Eighty a month, and grub.
- A month's too slow.

239
00:22:00,178 --> 00:22:04,080
- It's almost a thousand a year.
- Ayear's too long.

240
00:22:04,182 --> 00:22:07,845
That win money won't last.
I've seen punchers.

241
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:11,251
They come in flush and go out broke.
It's a natural law.

242
00:22:11,356 --> 00:22:14,792
Well, I might just change it.

243
00:22:14,893 --> 00:22:18,954
Britches getting
a little tight, ain't they, boy?

244
00:22:19,063 --> 00:22:22,555
- Oh, they fit.
- Well, watch it.

245
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:26,262
You might bust the seams.

246
00:22:26,371 --> 00:22:29,465
I was figuring on a-
on a quiet supper.

247
00:22:29,574 --> 00:22:31,542
Not tonight.

248
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:40,413
Well, now, that's twice today
I bet on the wrong animal.

249
00:22:40,518 --> 00:22:42,611
You're having a run of luck, boy.

250
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,052
The thing is...

251
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:47,147
can it last?

252
00:22:47,258 --> 00:22:49,283
I think it will.

253
00:22:49,394 --> 00:22:52,295
Go on, Lat. You're falling way behind.
These giris want to have some fun.

254
00:22:52,397 --> 00:22:56,299
- Yeah, sure. Come on.
- Happy, bring us another bottle.

255
00:23:14,219 --> 00:23:16,312
You sit. I'll fix a drink.

256
00:23:40,311 --> 00:23:42,279
Thanks.

257
00:23:47,418 --> 00:23:50,854
My outfit's pulling out tomorrow.

258
00:23:50,955 --> 00:23:53,082
I know.

259
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:01,964
Butler- he-he's the trail boss-

260
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:04,034
he's going back to Texas.

261
00:24:05,637 --> 00:24:07,605
Is he?

262
00:24:10,775 --> 00:24:14,370
I- I'm figuring on
hanging around for a while.

263
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:18,245
A fella in the crew says that wolf hides
is worth maybe five dollars apiece.

264
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,321
H- He says you can get maybe
a hundred wolves from just one bait.

265
00:24:35,533 --> 00:24:38,195
Can you?

266
00:24:38,303 --> 00:24:40,931
That's what the fella says.

267
00:24:47,145 --> 00:24:51,445
Tom's going with me-
huntin' wolves, I mean.

268
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:53,517
That's nice.

269
00:24:56,554 --> 00:25:00,012
You just make yourself comfortable.
I'll be right down.

270
00:26:23,474 --> 00:26:25,442
Lat?

271
00:26:28,112 --> 00:26:30,080
Lat?

272
00:26:58,843 --> 00:27:01,903
Well, I guess we'd better get going.

273
00:27:02,013 --> 00:27:04,208
- Mike.
- Oh, I'll ride out a ways with you.

274
00:27:04,315 --> 00:27:06,875
Fine.

275
00:27:06,984 --> 00:27:10,579
- Take care of yourself, Lat.
- Thanks, Ram, for everything.

276
00:27:10,688 --> 00:27:14,749
Nothin' to thank me for.
Just remember, people get changed.

277
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:17,726
By what?

278
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:19,990
Men you meet.

279
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:22,327
The way the cards fall.

280
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:25,425
The chippie that rolled you.
The friend you trusted.

281
00:27:25,536 --> 00:27:28,266
Add them up.

282
00:27:28,372 --> 00:27:30,932
Nobody ends like he started out.

283
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:54,589
The bunch is leaving, huh?

284
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:01,965
Always when the bunch left me,
I- I felt like a drink.

285
00:28:21,392 --> 00:28:24,054
Ah.

286
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,652
Drink hearty, boy.

287
00:28:31,702 --> 00:28:34,000
Drink, boy.

288
00:28:34,105 --> 00:28:37,006
You ain't a bird.

289
00:28:38,743 --> 00:28:42,804
Yes, sirree.
That cures the miseries.

290
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:47,340
When I was your age,
it was mostly giris.

291
00:28:47,451 --> 00:28:50,147
Now I'm my age,
it's mostly that it mostly ain't.

292
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:56,851
You happen to know a gal in town
by the name of Callie?

293
00:28:56,961 --> 00:29:00,328
Sure. Why?

294
00:29:00,431 --> 00:29:02,592
Is she anybody's in particular?

295
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,396
I wouldn't say in particular, son.

296
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:13,203
- Where you from?
- Oregon.

297
00:29:13,311 --> 00:29:15,677
What was it like?

298
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,307
- What?
- Home.

299
00:29:22,753 --> 00:29:25,483
Don't play cards.

300
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,558
Don't dance.

301
00:29:27,658 --> 00:29:29,649
And don't drink.

302
00:29:31,162 --> 00:29:33,460
I'll tell you, son...

303
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:37,193
it ain't what you do that spoils
your sleep, but what you missed.

304
00:29:37,301 --> 00:29:39,929
Take it from an old man.

305
00:29:46,177 --> 00:29:48,907
Now my nerves is all settled down.

306
00:29:49,013 --> 00:29:51,038
I'll just catch me a little nap.

307
00:29:54,185 --> 00:29:56,551
See you, son.

308
00:31:09,894 --> 00:31:12,385
All day I was hoping
you'd come back.

309
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,655
Why did you run off
like that last night?

310
00:31:53,404 --> 00:31:55,372
I don't know.

311
00:31:55,473 --> 00:31:57,873
Uh-

312
00:31:57,975 --> 00:32:00,466
Maybe-

313
00:32:00,578 --> 00:32:02,842
Well...

314
00:32:02,947 --> 00:32:07,543
when I was 12, 13 years old...

315
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:13,187
my pa caught me with a girl
out in the hay shed.

316
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:18,489
<i>We wasn't doing anything-
just-just kissing maybe.</i>

317
00:32:18,596 --> 00:32:21,997
<i>There stood Pa in the doorway.</i>

318
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:26,798
And there was this
buggy whip up on the wall.

319
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:30,169
Well- I- I didn't mind
for myself so much, but...

320
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:34,578
<i>h- he kept whipping her too.</i>

321
00:32:34,678 --> 00:32:38,739
<i>And she was crying
and dodging around.</i>

322
00:32:38,849 --> 00:32:42,182
Now, every time
there's a girl- any girl- I-

323
00:32:42,286 --> 00:32:45,483
I keep seeing Pa...

324
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,989
or something like him...

325
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:50,060
standing there in the doorway.

326
00:32:51,495 --> 00:32:54,396
Mine didn't whip me.

327
00:32:54,498 --> 00:32:57,934
He just sent me off far as he could.

328
00:32:58,035 --> 00:33:00,003
<i>Why?</i>

329
00:33:01,872 --> 00:33:04,067
He didn't come into the hay shed.

330
00:33:21,892 --> 00:33:24,827
I haven't cared for anybody
in such a long time, Lat.

331
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,748
Two months. Two whole months
of being snowbound...

332
00:33:53,858 --> 00:33:56,224
- wind-bound and cold-bound!
- You knew what it would be like.

333
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:58,887
A quick dollar.
Yeah, poisoning wolves.

334
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:00,964
I must've been out of my mind.

335
00:34:01,065 --> 00:34:03,499
I don't like it any better than you do.

336
00:34:03,601 --> 00:34:07,264
But we got 25 buffalo skins,
worth maybe two dollars apiece.

337
00:34:07,371 --> 00:34:09,839
And almost a hundred wolf pelts,
worth five dollars each.

338
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,068
<i>Money, huh?
You'd skin me if I had fur on.</i>

339
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:15,270
It ain't just the money I want.

340
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:17,745
Not even a ranch.

341
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:20,612
I want my name
to mean something.

342
00:34:20,718 --> 00:34:23,084
I heard about a fellow
named Granville Stuart-

343
00:34:23,187 --> 00:34:25,155
he started with nothing.

344
00:34:25,256 --> 00:34:28,020
Now he's got a big spread
over in the Flat Willow country.

345
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:30,958
He's got respect,
political influence, everything.

346
00:34:31,061 --> 00:34:33,655
- If he can do it, why can't I?
- Wolfer to rancher.

347
00:34:33,764 --> 00:34:36,289
- Plowboy to president, huh?
- Why not?

348
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,769
Because I ain't seen a man yet that didn't
step up by stepping down on somebody else!

349
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:43,169
I liked you more
when you stunk of cow, not wolf.

350
00:34:43,274 --> 00:34:45,765
- The stink will go, but the money's gonna stay!
- Yeah, well I won't!

351
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:51,280
I've had a bellyful. I'm cuttin' out.
I'm going back to Fort Brock.

352
00:34:51,382 --> 00:34:55,375
- You coming with me?
- Not until I got every hide I can get.

353
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:50,407
How.

354
00:35:50,507 --> 00:35:53,067
Friends?

355
00:35:54,845 --> 00:35:57,905
Smoke? Drink?

356
00:35:58,015 --> 00:36:01,610
Here, no. At cabin.

357
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:03,880
Much smoke, much drink.

358
00:36:03,988 --> 00:36:06,183
Much good things for empty belly.

359
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:12,960
<i>That good fast horse.</i>

360
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:43,549
No!

361
00:37:27,905 --> 00:37:29,873
I got to get you to Fort Brock.

362
00:37:31,775 --> 00:37:33,743
You hear?

363
00:37:37,748 --> 00:37:40,012
That bullet's got to come out.

364
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:49,522
What day is it?

365
00:37:49,626 --> 00:37:53,995
Monday, Tuesday- I don't know.

366
00:37:54,098 --> 00:37:58,558
- How much longer we got?
- A day or two, at the most.

367
00:37:58,669 --> 00:38:02,161
Tom, the skins!

368
00:38:02,272 --> 00:38:05,207
- Hey, Lat, you just take it easy.
- A hundred skins! They'll steal 'em!

369
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:10,110
Lat, I had to leave 'em, kid.
I- I couldn't pack you and the skins too.

370
00:38:11,515 --> 00:38:13,483
Come on now.

371
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:30,563
Tom, if I die, will you bury me
under a rock so the wolves don't get me?

372
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:33,568
You just shut up now.

373
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:36,332
You're still gonna live to die rich.

374
00:38:52,656 --> 00:38:54,783
Tom!

375
00:38:54,892 --> 00:38:58,453
- Oh, Tom, whatever happened?
- It's Lat.

376
00:38:58,562 --> 00:39:00,723
<i>He's outside. He's hurt.</i>

377
00:39:00,831 --> 00:39:04,062
<i>- He's hurt real bad.
- Oh,yeah. Can somebody get a doctor?</i>

378
00:39:04,168 --> 00:39:06,136
<i>Here, help me with him,
will you? Oh, Tom.</i>

379
00:39:06,236 --> 00:39:09,262
<i>Get me some whiskey, Happy.
Oh, Tom.</i>

380
00:39:09,373 --> 00:39:11,637
<i>Tom.</i>

381
00:39:11,742 --> 00:39:14,734
<i>Oh, poor Tom.</i>

382
00:39:14,845 --> 00:39:17,939
Lat?

383
00:39:27,724 --> 00:39:29,885
No. No, no. Lie still.

384
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,086
Lie still.

385
00:39:32,196 --> 00:39:36,132
- You'll get that fancy dress dirty.
- I don't care.

386
00:39:37,201 --> 00:39:39,863
I do. I bought it.

387
00:39:51,748 --> 00:39:54,114
<i>Time for breakfast.</i>

388
00:39:54,218 --> 00:39:57,654
- I'll finish up downstairs.
- All right, Happy.

389
00:39:57,754 --> 00:40:00,587
I think you're
getting back some weight.

390
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:03,819
I swear I never
saw a man that thin.

391
00:40:03,927 --> 00:40:07,624
I sure got it soft-

392
00:40:07,731 --> 00:40:10,165
breakfast in bed.

393
00:40:12,769 --> 00:40:15,101
A tray like that-what would
that cost in a restaurant?

394
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:18,265
Oh, depends what kind
of restaurant it is.

395
00:40:21,278 --> 00:40:23,678
<i>Callie, I'm leaving here today.</i>

396
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,771
You can't.

397
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:29,113
Why not? Tom's got a job.
You want me to sponge off you forever?

398
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:31,881
- But the doctor said-
- I don't care what the doctor said!

399
00:40:31,989 --> 00:40:35,049
There's only one kind of a man
that lives off a woman.

400
00:40:36,627 --> 00:40:40,063
Don't, Lat.

401
00:40:40,163 --> 00:40:44,691
W- Why should you
waste your time and money on me?

402
00:40:44,801 --> 00:40:47,736
It's not charity, Lat.
I like taking care of you.

403
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:50,966
I never felt this way
about anybody before.

404
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,378
A- Aren't I good enough for you?

405
00:40:55,479 --> 00:41:00,075
It's not you, Callie. It's me.

406
00:41:00,183 --> 00:41:03,550
I'm no closer to getting
that ranch now than I ever was.

407
00:41:03,654 --> 00:41:07,750
It's a whole winter gone by, and I ain't
got nothing to show for it. Not a dime.

408
00:41:11,161 --> 00:41:13,129
You got me.

409
00:41:30,314 --> 00:41:32,509
Excuse me. Who-Who do I see
about making a loan?

410
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:34,584
Pay in there.

411
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:40,184
Then you'll be at the meeting, Marsh?

412
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:43,054
- Excuse me.
- Don't stand in the door, boy.

413
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,287
Come in.

414
00:41:45,395 --> 00:41:48,023
- My name is Evans, Lat Evans.
- I know.

415
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:50,429
- Shake hands with Brother Vaughn.
- How are you?

416
00:41:50,534 --> 00:41:52,559
Mr. Evans is quite a jockey.

417
00:41:52,669 --> 00:41:55,194
Oh, the Lord loves a good rider.

418
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:58,797
Well, I ain't give him
much of a chance lately to love me.

419
00:41:58,909 --> 00:42:02,436
That don't matter, brother.
He makes his own chances.

420
00:42:02,546 --> 00:42:04,514
I'll see you tonight.

421
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,983
Mr. Conrad, uh-

422
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:15,081
uh, what-what I came
to see you about-

423
00:42:15,192 --> 00:42:17,786
Sit down.
Rest that hat.

424
00:42:24,735 --> 00:42:26,726
What can I do for you, Evans?

425
00:42:26,837 --> 00:42:29,670
Well, I don't have a job right now
and- and I'm out of money...

426
00:42:29,773 --> 00:42:32,503
and a bank loans money,
doesn't it?

427
00:42:32,609 --> 00:42:36,568
That's right.
A bank loans money.

428
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,978
There's also work
for anybody who's out of it.

429
00:42:39,082 --> 00:42:42,984
Well, uh, I'm not
after a job, Mr. Conrad.

430
00:42:43,086 --> 00:42:45,782
- What are you after?
- Ranching.

431
00:42:45,889 --> 00:42:48,084
Sheep or cattle?

432
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,591
- Cattle.
- Hmm.

433
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:54,357
- They call sheep the golden hoof.
- I like cattle.

434
00:42:54,464 --> 00:42:57,456
- Have you got a ranch in mind?
- Yep. Along the Tansy River.

435
00:42:57,567 --> 00:43:00,127
It's good high grass,
and high grass is fat grass.

436
00:43:00,237 --> 00:43:02,205
Could I see you
for a moment, Uncle?

437
00:43:02,305 --> 00:43:04,296
Oh, excuse me. I-

438
00:43:04,408 --> 00:43:07,605
<i>Notjust now, honey.
In a few minutes.</i>

439
00:43:10,814 --> 00:43:13,180
I'll wait outside.

440
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:18,714
I don't want to keep you
from anything important.

441
00:43:18,822 --> 00:43:21,290
It's all right.
She's my niece.

442
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:24,053
You know, Evans,
a bank isn't a racetrack.

443
00:43:24,161 --> 00:43:26,527
We can't afford to back gamblers.

444
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:28,723
Well, why not?
You gamble all the time, don't you...

445
00:43:28,832 --> 00:43:32,791
on weather and grass
and- and the price of cattle?

446
00:43:32,903 --> 00:43:35,997
I'm asking for a loan
as a start on something solid.

447
00:43:36,106 --> 00:43:40,406
- As a stake.
- I'm sorry, Evans. It's too much of a risk.

448
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:43,843
You get yourself some security-
a piece of land...

449
00:43:43,947 --> 00:43:46,177
<i>a deed,
something to put up-</i>

450
00:43:46,283 --> 00:43:48,251
<i>then we'll talk about a loan.</i>

451
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:53,186
Meanwhile, I will be very glad
to back any horse you race.

452
00:43:55,659 --> 00:43:57,627
Thanks.

453
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:01,829
For nothin'.

454
00:44:01,932 --> 00:44:04,696
- Is my uncle free now?
- Free?

455
00:44:04,801 --> 00:44:07,565
There ain't nothing free in this bank.

456
00:44:14,044 --> 00:44:16,012
<i>Lat?</i>

457
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:28,522
- Can I get you a cup of coffee?
- No.

458
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:33,187
- What's the matter?
- Nothing's the matter. I've been drinking.

459
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:36,493
I went to the bank
to ask for a loan...

460
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,830
for a stake on a ranch...

461
00:44:38,935 --> 00:44:43,736
but they don't loan you money
at a bank unless you got money.

462
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,001
So I've been drinkin'.

463
00:45:20,777 --> 00:45:24,076
The last time I counted,
there was more than $2,000 there.

464
00:45:27,617 --> 00:45:29,676
Buy the ranch you want, Lat.

465
00:45:32,822 --> 00:45:35,552
But- But, Callie,
that's your savings.

466
00:45:35,659 --> 00:45:37,627
I'm investing it.

467
00:45:39,796 --> 00:45:42,094
Oh, no. I- I can't.

468
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:45,133
Well, you'll pay it back.

469
00:45:45,235 --> 00:45:48,033
But what if I go broke
like my old man?

470
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:51,173
Not you, Lat.

471
00:45:53,677 --> 00:45:56,111
Maybe I'm just doing it
to keep you with me.

472
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:22,997
Well, there it is, Mr. Conrad.

473
00:46:23,106 --> 00:46:25,802
It's good fat grass,
just like I said.

474
00:46:25,909 --> 00:46:28,309
And I'm gonna put it
all under fence.

475
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:33,246
Fence? Why, there'll be free grazing land
in Montana longer than you'll ever live.

476
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:36,444
That's what they said
in Eastern Oregon a while back.

477
00:46:36,553 --> 00:46:39,681
You know, people say
that cattle do fine here.

478
00:46:39,789 --> 00:46:43,452
They say that natural pasture is enough,
even in the winter. But it isn't.

479
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,926
Because cows get poor
in the winter.

480
00:46:46,029 --> 00:46:49,465
And too many of'em die off.
And the calves are born spindly.

481
00:46:49,566 --> 00:46:51,830
And the beef weighs less.

482
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:55,701
And someday, who knows, we may even
have a cold stretch here like you never saw.

483
00:46:55,805 --> 00:47:00,003
And then come springtime, all them cows
will be dead that you lent money on.

484
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:02,601
- Go on.
- Well, my idea is...

485
00:47:02,712 --> 00:47:06,341
I'm gonna grow hay here, and I'll store it up
in my barn during the summer months...

486
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:09,816
and come winter,
I'll hand-feed it to my cattle.

487
00:47:09,919 --> 00:47:13,685
Fences, hay and homestead.

488
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:16,315
- In Montana?
- That's what I see coming.

489
00:47:16,426 --> 00:47:19,190
$2,000 won't buy many cows.

490
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:23,026
Be enough to get me started,
and that's all I need.

491
00:47:23,133 --> 00:47:26,193
The bank will match
whatever you've paid for the land.

492
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:29,499
Thanks.

493
00:47:29,606 --> 00:47:32,575
A straight business proposition.
Interest, one percent a month.

494
00:47:32,676 --> 00:47:34,667
That rate makes figuring easy.

495
00:47:34,778 --> 00:47:38,475
- Well, you're never gonna regret this, Mr. Conrad.
- Oh, one point.

496
00:47:38,581 --> 00:47:41,914
I make it as an older man.
You can take it or leave it.

497
00:47:42,018 --> 00:47:45,317
Too many young fellas
start out ambitious.

498
00:47:45,422 --> 00:47:48,255
Somewhere they leave
that ambition in a saloon...

499
00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:50,349
or a fancy boudoir.

500
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:58,725
Evans is a good name back home.

501
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:01,497
I'm out to make it
mean something here.

502
00:48:01,604 --> 00:48:03,572
Fine.

503
00:48:08,778 --> 00:48:11,941
Did you get what
you wanted this time, Mr. Evans?

504
00:48:14,784 --> 00:48:17,582
Yes, Miss Joyce.

505
00:48:17,687 --> 00:48:20,281
"For every beast
of the forest is mine..."

506
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:24,019
"...and the cattle
upon a thousand hills."

507
00:48:24,127 --> 00:48:26,095
Why not?

508
00:48:26,196 --> 00:48:28,357
Come into the bank.
We'll draw up the papers.

509
00:48:28,465 --> 00:48:30,660
Hiya.

510
00:48:35,805 --> 00:48:38,797
Yippee!
We're in business, boy!

511
00:48:38,908 --> 00:48:42,867
- Meaning what? - The loan, you
mutton-head! We got the money for the cows!

512
00:48:42,979 --> 00:48:46,312
- Whoo-hoo!
- Well, I'll be.

513
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:48,748
Yeah, but, Lat,
I got nothin' to put in the pot.

514
00:48:48,852 --> 00:48:51,821
- The chips is all yours.
- Eh, we're partners, ain't we?

515
00:48:51,921 --> 00:48:54,116
What do I have to do, knock that
into your thick skull?

516
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:57,318
Whoo! You and me's
runnin' this ranch together.

517
00:48:57,427 --> 00:49:00,590
And maybe we'll have Whitey
and Carmichael workin' with us too...

518
00:49:00,697 --> 00:49:02,927
if they want jobs.

519
00:49:03,032 --> 00:49:05,796
Ain't nobody ever wanted me
for a partner before.

520
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:08,564
Ahh.

521
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,968
Well, like I said,
you'd live to die rich, didn't I?

522
00:49:13,076 --> 00:49:16,512
Didn't I, huh?

523
00:50:25,782 --> 00:50:28,216
Come and get it!

524
00:50:30,253 --> 00:50:32,244
Come and get it!

525
00:50:33,423 --> 00:50:35,414
There ain't much!

526
00:51:16,399 --> 00:51:18,924
- Dressed for a buryin'?
- No, dinner.

527
00:51:19,035 --> 00:51:22,368
- In town?
- I ain't gonna eat it out in the brush.

528
00:51:22,472 --> 00:51:26,602
- Where's Tom?
- He rode in last night to seeJen.

529
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:29,371
- Whiskey's gone.
- I'll get you a bottle.

530
00:51:29,479 --> 00:51:32,573
Whitey, I think you'd better take a look
at the cows in the south pasture.

531
00:51:32,682 --> 00:51:34,912
They might drift into the fence.

532
00:51:35,018 --> 00:51:37,953
You know, it's a wonder to me
a cow ever lived till you got here.

533
00:51:38,054 --> 00:51:40,022
A lot of'em didn't.

534
00:51:53,002 --> 00:51:55,596
Well, Mr. Evans.

535
00:51:55,705 --> 00:51:57,832
- And dressed fancy.
- Hello,Jehu.

536
00:51:57,941 --> 00:52:02,105
- Party somewhere?
- At the hotel.

537
00:52:02,211 --> 00:52:04,839
I'm invited to dinner
by the Conrads.

538
00:52:04,948 --> 00:52:08,179
I hear the winter busted
nearly everybody but you, Evans.

539
00:52:08,284 --> 00:52:12,653
- Did it?
- Half my herd's gone. And I got horses missing.

540
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:16,521
- Stolen?
- Looks like it.

541
00:52:16,626 --> 00:52:21,427
If you're thinkin' of sellin' what's left of
your herd, I'm lookin' for some more head.

542
00:52:21,531 --> 00:52:23,499
Ain't that pressin' your luck, Evans?

543
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:26,932
It's either me or the auctioneer.

544
00:52:27,036 --> 00:52:29,937
Besides, you said once
my luck wouldn't last.

545
00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:33,133
Maybe we both ain't waited
long enough to tell.

546
00:52:33,242 --> 00:52:36,769
See me after roundup.
I might listen to your price.

547
00:52:47,123 --> 00:52:50,718
- Hello, Mr. Strain.
- Oh, hello, Mr. Evans.

548
00:52:50,827 --> 00:52:53,625
- I got some mail for you.
- Good.

549
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:55,789
- There you are.
- Thank you.

550
00:52:55,898 --> 00:52:57,866
- A bottle of whiskey.
- Mm-hmm.

551
00:52:57,967 --> 00:53:01,232
- Cash.
- Your credit's good.

552
00:53:01,337 --> 00:53:03,567
<i>Not for whiskey.</i>

553
00:53:05,608 --> 00:53:07,576
<i>- Howdy, Lat. Mr. Strain.
- Hello, Tom.</i>

554
00:53:07,677 --> 00:53:09,872
- Tom.
- Can I have a couple of scoops of flour?

555
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:13,039
- You bet ya.
- Taking up baking, Tom?

556
00:53:13,149 --> 00:53:15,140
Not me. Callie.

557
00:53:15,251 --> 00:53:17,310
Yeah, she's baking you a cake.

558
00:53:21,424 --> 00:53:24,985
Oh, Lat, uh, what time will I tell Callie
you'll be over?

559
00:53:29,699 --> 00:53:32,099
Tonight, after supper.

560
00:53:32,201 --> 00:53:34,396
Here you are.
Two bits.

561
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,068
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

562
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:56,384
Oh, Lat, there's something
else I got to tell you.

563
00:53:56,492 --> 00:53:58,517
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

564
00:53:58,628 --> 00:54:03,065
Well, you see, we want
you should stand up with us.

565
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:06,260
- What?
- Well, you and Callie, that is.

566
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:08,360
- Stand up?
- Yeah.

567
00:54:08,471 --> 00:54:10,530
Well,Jen and me,
we're gonna get hitched.

568
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,471
You to her?

569
00:54:12,575 --> 00:54:15,043
Well, she says I'm good enough.

570
00:54:15,144 --> 00:54:18,113
- Tom.
- We're gonna make it proper.

571
00:54:18,214 --> 00:54:23,083
If old Brother Vaughn's in town,
we're gonna have him tie the knot.

572
00:54:23,186 --> 00:54:26,212
Oh, I know I ain't got nothin',
exceptin' our partnership.

573
00:54:26,322 --> 00:54:29,917
And-And Jen-well, she ain't
never saved a dime, but-

574
00:54:30,026 --> 00:54:31,994
Well, I figure between us-

575
00:54:32,095 --> 00:54:36,623
Well, we got each other, and- and that's
a pretty good hand to draw to.

576
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:38,723
And what she's been?

577
00:54:42,105 --> 00:54:44,096
Well, I ain't so pure myself.

578
00:54:44,207 --> 00:54:46,801
Neither are you.
Neither is nobody.

579
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:49,173
Now, I asked you a question, Lat.

580
00:54:49,278 --> 00:54:51,576
You gonna stand up with us?

581
00:54:51,681 --> 00:54:53,649
We'd like it the best in the worid.

582
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:57,810
Tom, she's a tramp.

583
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,514
Wife or not,
she'll always be known as that.

584
00:55:11,868 --> 00:55:14,666
Well, uh-

585
00:55:17,306 --> 00:55:19,365
Pious, ain't you, huh?

586
00:55:19,475 --> 00:55:23,434
A hunk of land, a banker's hello and nobody's
respectable enough for you, huh?

587
00:55:23,546 --> 00:55:25,514
Well, whose money got you started?

588
00:55:25,615 --> 00:55:27,583
A tramp's!

589
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:31,776
Why, you gutless-

590
00:55:31,888 --> 00:55:33,856
You're a gutless-

591
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:39,158
Come on.

592
00:55:39,262 --> 00:55:42,356
Hyah!

593
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:45,400
And you know what you can do
with the partnership.

594
00:55:56,646 --> 00:55:59,843
Blessed Lord, make us truly thankful
for these, thy bounties.

595
00:55:59,949 --> 00:56:02,076
- Amen.
- Amen.

596
00:56:02,185 --> 00:56:04,380
- Aha! Chicken and dumplings.
- Your favorite?

597
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:08,218
- Never get tired of chicken and dumplings.
- Just the chicken for me, Uncle.

598
00:56:08,324 --> 00:56:10,349
Very well.

599
00:56:11,961 --> 00:56:15,260
- A penny for your thoughts.
- There.

600
00:56:15,364 --> 00:56:18,424
Oh. Two bits in this country.

601
00:56:18,534 --> 00:56:21,298
- Two bits?
- A quarter.

602
00:56:21,404 --> 00:56:23,395
Oh.

603
00:56:23,506 --> 00:56:26,373
Are your thoughts
worth a whole quarter?

604
00:56:26,475 --> 00:56:31,139
I was just thinking
how my pa used to say grace.

605
00:56:31,247 --> 00:56:33,238
- At home?
- Yeah.

606
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:37,547
<i>I'm holding a service tonight, Brother Evans.
New faces delight the Lord.</i>

607
00:56:37,653 --> 00:56:41,646
Well, uh, I was reared in the church.

608
00:56:41,757 --> 00:56:46,194
- Praise be. And you see that
he don't backslide, sister.

609
00:56:46,295 --> 00:56:50,823
I wish I could talk to a jury the way
Brother Vaughn hammers at us sinners.

610
00:56:50,933 --> 00:56:53,959
Three things a town needs:
a good preacher...

611
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:57,130
a good lawyer
and a good school.

612
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:02,109
We've got two. In order to have
a good school, you have to have a board.

613
00:57:02,211 --> 00:57:04,771
I'd like to see you serve
on that school board, Lat.

614
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,281
<i>- Me?
- You, my son.</i>

615
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:11,751
Well, uh, I'm not much educated.

616
00:57:11,854 --> 00:57:13,947
<i>"Much" is a relative word.</i>

617
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:18,891
Anybody smart enough to triple his herd
as quick as you have is educated enough.

618
00:57:18,995 --> 00:57:21,987
<i>Think it over.
But I'll tell you one thing:</i>

619
00:57:22,098 --> 00:57:24,259
A man starts in with property...

620
00:57:24,367 --> 00:57:26,892
then if he's the right man,
he serves on the school board.

621
00:57:27,003 --> 00:57:29,494
<i>And after that, who knows?</i>

622
00:57:29,605 --> 00:57:34,338
<i>I've known some me to go on
to the state legislature and even further.</i>

623
00:57:40,883 --> 00:57:43,750
<i>Lat?</i>

624
00:57:52,428 --> 00:57:55,090
You gonna ask a gentleman
in for a drink?

625
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:02,131
The house is fresh out of liquor.

626
00:58:02,238 --> 00:58:06,868
- If it's Evans you're expectin', don't.
- Why?

627
00:58:06,976 --> 00:58:11,208
Well, they serve mighty long dinners
over at the Conrads'.

628
00:58:11,314 --> 00:58:13,544
Besides, she's a pretty girl,
that Miss Joyce.

629
00:58:13,649 --> 00:58:16,140
Tidy, educated.

630
00:58:16,252 --> 00:58:18,379
Been to college and all that.

631
00:58:21,857 --> 00:58:24,826
Looks like I'm the only one
with a real sweet tooth tonight.

632
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:29,321
You know how it is.

633
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:34,697
When a man ain't had somethin'
sweet for a long time...

634
00:58:34,804 --> 00:58:36,829
he gets to cravin' it.

635
00:58:43,846 --> 00:58:47,338
- Particular with your kisses?
- I am tonight.

636
00:58:49,785 --> 00:58:51,810
Oh, stop it.

637
00:58:54,357 --> 00:58:57,849
Let me go!

638
00:59:22,218 --> 00:59:24,277
With my compliments.

639
00:59:36,532 --> 00:59:38,932
- Two bits for your thoughts.
- Hmm?

640
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:41,093
Oh.

641
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:43,637
Well, I was thinking
of buyin' some more cows.

642
00:59:43,739 --> 00:59:45,730
Oh.

643
00:59:45,841 --> 00:59:49,140
After this winter, a lot of men'll
have to sell if they can.

644
00:59:49,245 --> 00:59:51,577
It doesn't seem fair.

645
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,808
I don't make the weather,Joyce.

646
00:59:54,917 --> 00:59:57,579
Don't hold it against me
for being prepared.

647
00:59:57,686 --> 01:00:00,154
Oh, Lat, I don't hold
anything against you.

648
01:00:00,256 --> 01:00:02,247
Maybe I got a right to sit pretty.

649
01:00:02,358 --> 01:00:05,486
You don't sit long enough to be pretty.

650
01:00:05,594 --> 01:00:08,563
- So I'm ugly?
- As a mud fence.

651
01:00:09,765 --> 01:00:11,995
I happen to like mud fences.

652
01:00:15,905 --> 01:00:19,534
Well, here we are- home.

653
01:00:20,976 --> 01:00:23,069
Good night, Lat.

654
01:00:23,179 --> 01:00:26,114
When am I gonna see you again?

655
01:00:26,215 --> 01:00:28,513
Mmm?

656
01:00:28,617 --> 01:00:31,609
- It depends.
- On what?

657
01:00:32,988 --> 01:00:35,513
Oh, on your reputation.

658
01:00:37,593 --> 01:00:40,892
You know, I don't know
very much about you.

659
01:00:40,996 --> 01:00:42,987
What would you like to know?

660
01:00:44,934 --> 01:00:49,371
Oh, well, for instance, um,
do you gamble at cards?

661
01:00:51,006 --> 01:00:52,997
All the time.

662
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:55,303
And use the Lord's name in vain?

663
01:00:55,411 --> 01:00:57,538
- Often.
- And break the Sabbath?

664
01:00:57,646 --> 01:01:00,513
Cows don't know when it's Sunday.

665
01:01:02,818 --> 01:01:05,719
Well, when you're on the school board,
you'll have to educate your cows.

666
01:01:07,923 --> 01:01:10,414
It was a lovely evening, Lat.

667
01:01:16,999 --> 01:01:20,127
I'll be home whenever you call.

668
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:04,108
<i>Callie?</i>

669
01:02:21,497 --> 01:02:23,522
Callie?

670
01:02:25,334 --> 01:02:28,895
Lat! Lat!

671
01:02:29,004 --> 01:02:30,972
Lat!

672
01:02:31,073 --> 01:02:33,064
Hey!

673
01:02:33,175 --> 01:02:35,143
What's the matter?

674
01:02:35,244 --> 01:02:37,235
Can't I be happy to see you?

675
01:02:37,346 --> 01:02:40,008
Not so happy you cry.

676
01:02:42,451 --> 01:02:45,352
I'm sorry I'm late. I-

677
01:02:45,454 --> 01:02:48,480
I was invited to dinner
by Mr. Conrad.

678
01:02:50,359 --> 01:02:52,384
Who was there?

679
01:02:53,629 --> 01:02:55,961
Conrad and his niece...

680
01:02:56,065 --> 01:02:59,193
and Link Gorham, the lawyer...

681
01:02:59,301 --> 01:03:01,861
and Brother Vaughn.

682
01:03:03,939 --> 01:03:05,998
You liked that, didn't you?

683
01:03:07,142 --> 01:03:09,201
I guess so.

684
01:03:10,813 --> 01:03:12,804
Yeah.

685
01:03:12,915 --> 01:03:15,941
Yes, I did.

686
01:03:16,051 --> 01:03:19,077
But there are a lot of things
I don't like, Callie.

687
01:03:19,188 --> 01:03:22,089
Like what?

688
01:03:22,191 --> 01:03:26,890
Like... the way things are.

689
01:03:26,996 --> 01:03:29,464
The-

690
01:03:29,565 --> 01:03:31,556
The way I am.

691
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:35,467
<i>- For comin'here?
- I wanted to see you, or I wouldn't have come.</i>

692
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:40,571
But to come here from dinner
with all those important people.

693
01:03:44,246 --> 01:03:47,238
Mr. Conrad thinks I ought
to run for office someday.

694
01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:51,479
He thinks I ought to start
with the school board maybe.

695
01:03:53,856 --> 01:03:56,916
Are you goin' to?

696
01:03:57,026 --> 01:03:59,494
<i>I told them I'd think about it.</i>

697
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:04,789
You'll be a good one.

698
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:08,131
I don't know about that.

699
01:04:11,373 --> 01:04:13,398
But I-

700
01:04:13,509 --> 01:04:16,205
I wanted to tell you.

701
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:18,404
You're the one
that's on the way up, Lat.

702
01:04:19,615 --> 01:04:21,583
I owe my start to you.

703
01:04:22,918 --> 01:04:24,909
But you gotta finish by yourself.

704
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:27,045
That's what you're tryin'
to tell me, isn't it, Lat?

705
01:04:32,227 --> 01:04:34,388
If I could only do something for you.

706
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:36,896
Oh, there's nothing
you can do for me.

707
01:04:36,999 --> 01:04:39,695
What you want is a starched wife
and a starched home...

708
01:04:39,802 --> 01:04:42,737
and a starched reputation,
and I'm spoiling your chances of getting it.

709
01:04:42,838 --> 01:04:46,274
You just keep on being nice to bankers
and their nieces, and you'll get what you want.

710
01:04:46,375 --> 01:04:48,468
- Stop it!
- Stop what? There's nothing to stop.

711
01:04:48,577 --> 01:04:51,045
Everything goes on till it ends.
That's all.

712
01:04:52,581 --> 01:04:54,640
Maybe you're right.

713
01:04:55,751 --> 01:04:58,743
Maybe that is what I want.

714
01:04:58,854 --> 01:05:01,186
I never lied to you, Callie.

715
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:06,327
But I'll always be grateful.

716
01:05:06,428 --> 01:05:08,726
Men and their gratitude!

717
01:05:08,831 --> 01:05:12,597
Don't you worry about me!
You just keep climbing, and you'll get there!

718
01:05:12,701 --> 01:05:14,896
- The only place you and I ever got was right-
- Don't-

719
01:05:15,003 --> 01:05:18,336
That bother you? You think your father's
gonna come in that door with a buggy whip?

720
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,170
- Stop it!
- And don't you dare feel sorry for me!

721
01:05:21,276 --> 01:05:23,744
You think I'd marry you?
I wouldn't even marry you if you asked me!

722
01:05:23,846 --> 01:05:27,509
You think I'd give up all this to scrub
and clean for you on some filthy ranch?

723
01:05:27,616 --> 01:05:30,141
- All right. All right! I'll go! I'll go!
- Not on your life!

724
01:05:30,252 --> 01:05:32,777
You better go! There's nothing more
for you to hang around here for!

725
01:05:32,888 --> 01:05:37,348
Me- I'm unstarched!
She's your type, that little hymn singer!

726
01:07:02,945 --> 01:07:06,210
Are you going to the speaking, Tom?

727
01:07:06,315 --> 01:07:08,840
What for?

728
01:07:08,951 --> 01:07:11,977
I've heard enough
four-flushers in my time.

729
01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:17,516
Sure, I can hear him right now.

730
01:07:17,626 --> 01:07:22,359
"Ladies, gentlemen
and horse thieves."

731
01:07:22,464 --> 01:07:26,264
I give you our next senator...

732
01:07:26,368 --> 01:07:30,031
Albert Gallatin Evans!

733
01:07:41,783 --> 01:07:43,808
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

734
01:07:43,919 --> 01:07:48,379
No. I wanna hear
what the senator has to say.

735
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:50,958
I got a few questions to ask him myself.

736
01:07:51,059 --> 01:07:54,495
- Now?
- No. Later tonight.

737
01:07:54,596 --> 01:07:58,657
I wanna find out his political
views about horse stealin'.

738
01:07:58,767 --> 01:08:02,828
I'm gonna give him a real chance
to serve this community.

739
01:08:26,862 --> 01:08:31,026
<i>Evenin', Lat.Jehu and I got somethin'
we gotta talk to you about.</i>

740
01:08:31,133 --> 01:08:33,192
Come in.

741
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:40,038
Sit down.
The wife's in bed.

742
01:08:40,142 --> 01:08:43,634
- You boys want some coffee?
- Uh, no, thanks, Lat.

743
01:08:43,745 --> 01:08:45,770
Well, it happened again last night.

744
01:08:45,881 --> 01:08:48,679
The stallion's gone.
They got intoJehu's corral too.

745
01:08:48,784 --> 01:08:51,150
You missin' any?

746
01:08:51,253 --> 01:08:54,984
- I watch my stock close.
- Sure.

747
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:57,081
Any idea who's doin' the rustlin'?

748
01:08:57,192 --> 01:09:01,185
We know one thing:
They're cabined up north in the breaks.

749
01:09:01,296 --> 01:09:04,265
- We're gonna jump 'em.
- When?

750
01:09:04,366 --> 01:09:07,665
Dawn. That's why we're here.
We're lookin' for you to come along.

751
01:09:07,769 --> 01:09:10,363
Up there in the breaks, huh?

752
01:09:12,674 --> 01:09:14,767
What makes you so sure
they're guilty?

753
01:09:14,876 --> 01:09:17,106
There are no innocent men
in the breaks.

754
01:09:17,212 --> 01:09:20,079
<i>- I don't like it, Frank.
- Why?</i>

755
01:09:20,182 --> 01:09:22,173
You'll be gunnin'
for everything in sight.

756
01:09:22,284 --> 01:09:24,218
<i>- That stick in your craw?
- A little.</i>

757
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:27,379
What do you want, Evans,
a vote from the Bible class?

758
01:09:27,489 --> 01:09:29,480
<i>Easy,Jehu.</i>

759
01:09:29,591 --> 01:09:31,957
<i>Lat knows all we're doin'
is protectin'our property.</i>

760
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:34,085
That's his side of the fence too.

761
01:09:34,196 --> 01:09:37,063
And he ain't big enough yet
to go it alone.

762
01:09:37,165 --> 01:09:40,066
It's our horses now.
Tomorrow it'll be yours.

763
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:43,562
All I'm saying is wait.

764
01:09:43,672 --> 01:09:47,335
<i>- For what?
- Evidence.</i>

765
01:09:47,442 --> 01:09:49,410
And then let Sheriff Slade handle it.

766
01:09:49,511 --> 01:09:52,207
Slade says the breaks are over the line-
out of his jurisdiction.

767
01:09:52,314 --> 01:09:56,080
Did they wait for the sheriff
over at Gold Creek? They shot 'em up.

768
01:09:56,184 --> 01:09:59,244
"Vigilante" is just a polite name
for "murderer", Jehu.

769
01:09:59,354 --> 01:10:03,120
You know, Lat,
Jehu, me, other ranchers...

770
01:10:03,225 --> 01:10:05,921
we swing a lot of votes
in this territory.

771
01:10:06,028 --> 01:10:08,826
<i>Now, wait a minute.
I'll tell you what.</i>

772
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:12,422
I'll make you a promise.
We ride out to the breaks-

773
01:10:12,534 --> 01:10:14,764
no shootin'
unless they shoot first-

774
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:18,362
and when we're sure, we'll bring 'em in
for Slade to throw into the lockup.

775
01:10:18,473 --> 01:10:22,910
<i>- Fair enough?
- Who you speakin' for?</i>

776
01:10:23,011 --> 01:10:27,505
Brice Walker, McLean, the Swede,
all of us that's goin'.

777
01:10:30,986 --> 01:10:35,480
- All right. I'm in.
- I knew you'd see it our way, Evans.

778
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:38,650
We're only doin' what a man's
got to do to protect his own.

779
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:41,320
Ride over to my place before dawn.

780
01:10:58,413 --> 01:11:01,246
Lat, what is it?

781
01:11:03,385 --> 01:11:05,945
It's nothing.

782
01:11:06,054 --> 01:11:08,147
A little trouble over at Chenault's place.

783
01:11:08,256 --> 01:11:10,315
I have to ride over there before dawn.

784
01:11:10,425 --> 01:11:12,484
Oh.

785
01:11:16,098 --> 01:11:19,795
You're pretty any hour of the day.
Do you know that?

786
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:21,994
Oh, Lat.

787
01:11:22,104 --> 01:11:25,767
You're so thin.
You work too hard.

788
01:11:25,874 --> 01:11:28,672
You haven't an ounce
of flesh on your bones.

789
01:11:28,777 --> 01:11:34,477
 Work, for the night is comin' 

790
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:39,611
 Rest comes sure and soon 

791
01:11:39,721 --> 01:11:42,281
Not that kind.

792
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:44,415
What about this kind?

793
01:11:54,736 --> 01:11:57,364
You thinking?

794
01:11:57,472 --> 01:12:02,068
I was just thinkin' about somethin'
my pa used to read from the Bible.

795
01:12:03,745 --> 01:12:09,581
"A virtuous woman
is a crown to her husband."

796
01:12:12,921 --> 01:12:15,014
What part of the Bible is that from?

797
01:12:15,123 --> 01:12:17,148
From Proverbs.

798
01:12:21,096 --> 01:12:23,326
Lat?

799
01:12:23,431 --> 01:12:25,456
Are you asleep?

800
01:12:48,723 --> 01:12:51,021
Cabin's ahead, to the right.

801
01:12:51,126 --> 01:12:53,151
We'll go up on foot.

802
01:12:55,230 --> 01:12:57,630
Ride closer,
and a horse'll whinny.

803
01:12:57,732 --> 01:13:00,599
- How does the cabin set?
- Facing us- south.

804
01:13:00,702 --> 01:13:03,193
One door in front, and no place else
for 'em to make a break.

805
01:13:03,305 --> 01:13:05,296
Leave Gunderson with the horses.

806
01:13:05,407 --> 01:13:08,501
- But I shoot good.
- Stay with the horses.

807
01:13:16,751 --> 01:13:18,844
Here's a spot for you to angle off.

808
01:13:20,222 --> 01:13:22,281
Be careful, Lat.

809
01:14:05,967 --> 01:14:09,198
Now, come on outta there!

810
01:14:49,577 --> 01:14:51,636
No more! Don't shoot!
We come out!

811
01:15:10,765 --> 01:15:12,733
<i>No! No, no, no, no!
Mon dieu!</i>

812
01:15:12,834 --> 01:15:14,893
No, have pity, huh?
Have pity!

813
01:15:15,003 --> 01:15:18,131
Save your prayers!
You'll need 'em in hell!

814
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:22,073
- Tom!
- You're all here, huh?

815
01:15:22,177 --> 01:15:25,271
Includin' the senator.

816
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:29,976
All the groundhogs, the water hogs
and the natural-born hogs.

817
01:15:30,085 --> 01:15:32,212
Talk big or go beggin'
like your friend.

818
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:35,153
We got a cure for both.
Anyone in there?

819
01:15:35,256 --> 01:15:37,656
Yeah, Bigsbee,
shot through the face.

820
01:15:37,759 --> 01:15:39,954
McLean, have a look.

821
01:15:43,531 --> 01:15:48,230
Saves hangin'.
Now, Mac, look inside.

822
01:15:49,604 --> 01:15:51,595
Give me that rope.

823
01:15:51,706 --> 01:15:54,937
Make it good,Jehu.
I don't wanna hang on the wrong knot.

824
01:15:55,043 --> 01:15:59,439
<i>- Tie his hands.
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!</i>

825
01:15:59,547 --> 01:16:01,538
You gave a promise, Frank- no hangin'.

826
01:16:01,649 --> 01:16:03,617
We're takin' him to the sheriff
if he's guilty.

827
01:16:03,718 --> 01:16:05,709
- If?
- Let's hear what he's got to say.

828
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:08,220
- We know he's guilty.
- Shut up!

829
01:16:08,323 --> 01:16:13,317
Tom, what about them horses
in the corral?

830
01:16:13,428 --> 01:16:16,124
Well, they got four legs,
ain't they, Senator?

831
01:16:16,231 --> 01:16:19,598
- They're stolen.
- We're givin' you a chance, Ping.

832
01:16:19,701 --> 01:16:22,059
- Talk up if you're innocent.
- Innocent?

833
01:16:22,170 --> 01:16:24,161
Well, that depends
on who the jury is.

834
01:16:24,272 --> 01:16:26,467
I'll tell you a couple of things
I ain't guilty of.

835
01:16:26,574 --> 01:16:29,168
<i>I ain't prayed on Sunday.</i>

836
01:16:29,277 --> 01:16:33,111
<i>Bought cows cheap on Monday.
I ain't broke my word.</i>

837
01:16:33,214 --> 01:16:35,774
I ain't climbed up high
on somebody else's back...

838
01:16:35,884 --> 01:16:39,285
or thought of myself better
than another man.

839
01:16:39,387 --> 01:16:44,689
I ain't double-crossed a friend
or made a little tin god out of money.

840
01:16:44,793 --> 01:16:48,251
Sure, I'm innocent.
I'm as innocent as you.

841
01:16:50,565 --> 01:16:53,500
Or ain't you boys innocent?

842
01:16:55,136 --> 01:16:57,127
Like he says. It's Bigsbee...

843
01:16:57,238 --> 01:16:59,968
shot through the face,
and the cabin's full of branding irons.

844
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:02,042
Are you satisfied now?

845
01:17:02,143 --> 01:17:04,202
Here.

846
01:17:04,312 --> 01:17:06,610
Throw this rope over that branch.

847
01:17:06,714 --> 01:17:09,649
Bring up a horse.

848
01:17:09,751 --> 01:17:13,187
Guilty or not,
you ain't hangin' him,Jehu.

849
01:17:13,288 --> 01:17:15,347
The agreement was
we take him in for the sheriff...

850
01:17:15,457 --> 01:17:18,722
and he stands trial,
and that's the way it's gonna be!

851
01:17:18,827 --> 01:17:22,228
- You takin' him in, Senator?
- That's right.

852
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:24,389
- Brice.
- Yeah?

853
01:17:24,499 --> 01:17:27,866
Cover Evans.

854
01:17:27,969 --> 01:17:32,167
<i>You never intended
to take him in, did you,Jehu?</i>

855
01:17:32,273 --> 01:17:35,470
We're cleaning out these hills
once and for all.

856
01:17:35,577 --> 01:17:40,674
You comin' along guarantees
you won't open your mouth to the law.

857
01:17:40,782 --> 01:17:42,841
Move.

858
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:07,900
Brice, I'm afraid you're
gonna have to use that gun.

859
01:18:08,009 --> 01:18:11,206
Now, Lat, he told us himself
them broncs were stolen.

860
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:14,247
He's entitled to a trial.
That's what the law says.

861
01:18:29,797 --> 01:18:32,561
Hey, Lat.

862
01:18:45,013 --> 01:18:47,811
Hey!

863
01:19:00,862 --> 01:19:03,296
Neck's broke.

864
01:19:03,398 --> 01:19:05,457
Let's get out of here.

865
01:19:28,089 --> 01:19:30,080
I'll go on into town.

866
01:19:30,191 --> 01:19:32,250
You sure you're
gonna be all right?

867
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:35,352
- Yeah.
- There ain't no need to go blamin' yourself.

868
01:19:35,463 --> 01:19:37,454
No, it's just like Tom said:

869
01:19:37,565 --> 01:19:41,365
"Plowboy to rancher
and rancher to president."

870
01:19:41,469 --> 01:19:43,733
Maybe I'll make it yet.

871
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:16,536
Lat, I waited all day.

872
01:20:19,674 --> 01:20:22,700
At Chenault's they said
you'd ridden off into the hills.

873
01:20:26,848 --> 01:20:28,941
Frank's wife said she
thought you'd gone hunting.

874
01:20:32,954 --> 01:20:36,151
That's right. We-

875
01:20:36,257 --> 01:20:38,885
We went hunting.

876
01:20:38,993 --> 01:20:42,724
When I came back,
there was a note for you under the door.

877
01:20:50,638 --> 01:20:52,697
Who is Callie?

878
01:20:55,443 --> 01:20:58,844
She's a... girl I used to know.

879
01:20:58,946 --> 01:21:01,107
Well, the note says she needs you.

880
01:21:01,215 --> 01:21:03,615
- Isn't that what it says?
- Yeah.

881
01:21:03,718 --> 01:21:07,154
Well, is she accustomed to sending you
notes when she's in trouble?

882
01:21:10,291 --> 01:21:12,987
- She has a right to.
- The right?

883
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:17,828
Were you in love with her?

884
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:20,891
What's past is past.

885
01:21:21,002 --> 01:21:23,027
Oh, of course.

886
01:21:26,674 --> 01:21:30,974
- When did you meet her?
- When I first came to Fort Brock.

887
01:21:31,079 --> 01:21:35,482
- Not at a church social, I imagine.
- No, not at a church social.

888
01:21:35,583 --> 01:21:40,646
Oh, you were lonesome.
A lonesome cowboy, and she was kind to you.

889
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:46,023
- More than that.
- More?

890
01:21:46,127 --> 01:21:51,690
Five years ago, she lent me the money
she had saved up to get this ranch started.

891
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:59,737
I see.

892
01:21:59,841 --> 01:22:04,403
Then I'm indebted to her, too, aren't I?
For everything?

893
01:22:04,512 --> 01:22:09,006
<i>Lat, if you go into town
and see her...</i>

894
01:22:09,117 --> 01:22:11,449
I won't be here
when you get back.

895
01:22:11,552 --> 01:22:16,580
<i>Now,Joyce, I love you.</i>

896
01:22:16,691 --> 01:22:19,922
<i>What's past is past.</i>

897
01:22:20,027 --> 01:22:22,291
But I've been takin' a good
long look at myself today...

898
01:22:22,396 --> 01:22:24,455
and I don't like
what I've seen.

899
01:22:24,565 --> 01:22:26,829
I don't like what I've become.

900
01:22:26,934 --> 01:22:28,993
That's why I have to go into town.

901
01:22:29,103 --> 01:22:31,094
You still love her.

902
01:22:31,205 --> 01:22:33,696
You know I don't.

903
01:22:33,808 --> 01:22:36,106
But I owe Callie somethin'.

904
01:22:36,210 --> 01:22:39,475
I owe her the right to call on me
when she needs help.

905
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:42,105
Oh, how can I believe you?

906
01:22:42,216 --> 01:22:45,310
Why should you want to see her now
if you haven't been seeing her?

907
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:48,081
How do I know there haven't been
other notes on other occasions?

908
01:22:50,224 --> 01:22:52,988
You'll just have to believe me.

909
01:23:12,647 --> 01:23:14,945
Come in, Mr. Lat.
I've been waiting.

910
01:23:18,186 --> 01:23:20,746
- Where is she?
- Upstairs.

911
01:23:25,092 --> 01:23:28,653
She didn't write that note,
Mr. Lat. I wrote it.

912
01:23:28,763 --> 01:23:32,324
- You?
- She ain't got nobody else but you to turn to, Mr. Lat.

913
01:23:32,433 --> 01:23:34,924
She's gotJehu.
I'm out of her life now.

914
01:23:35,036 --> 01:23:38,005
Mr.Jehu-
He's just trash.

915
01:23:38,105 --> 01:23:41,871
He come here early this afternoon,
and he was feelin' ugly.

916
01:23:41,976 --> 01:23:44,843
Him and Miss Callie was
in the parlor here, drinkin'.

917
01:23:44,946 --> 01:23:47,540
She's been drinkin' bad, Miss Callie.

918
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:49,741
Won't stop for nobody.

919
01:23:49,851 --> 01:23:52,411
I was outside on the back steps
just gettin' a little air...

920
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,613
when I heard Mr.Jehu cursin'...

921
01:23:54,722 --> 01:23:56,986
so I run in,
and he's beatin' her.

922
01:23:57,091 --> 01:24:02,290
She's up there with the door closed,
and she won't come down.

923
01:24:02,396 --> 01:24:04,455
She ain't made a sound up there.

924
01:24:07,468 --> 01:24:09,959
Ain't nothin' to blame anybody for.

925
01:24:10,071 --> 01:24:12,301
Just maybe it would be better
if she left this town...

926
01:24:12,406 --> 01:24:15,341
'cause it ain't brought her
nothin' but bad luck.

927
01:24:26,387 --> 01:24:29,254
<i>Callie?</i>

928
01:24:29,357 --> 01:24:31,951
<i>Callie, I wanna talk to you.</i>

929
01:24:32,059 --> 01:24:35,256
You didn't have to come all the way
down here to get my vote.

930
01:24:35,363 --> 01:24:38,127
Don't worry.
I'll vote for you come election day.

931
01:24:38,232 --> 01:24:40,894
Happy said thatJehu hit you.

932
01:24:42,703 --> 01:24:44,728
Sure he did.

933
01:24:44,839 --> 01:24:47,399
Why not?

934
01:24:47,508 --> 01:24:50,773
<i>Callie, open the door.</i>

935
01:24:50,878 --> 01:24:53,608
He said they-
they hung Tom Ping.

936
01:24:53,714 --> 01:24:58,117
<i>- Did they?
- Yes.</i>

937
01:24:58,219 --> 01:25:02,986
- Were you there?
- Yes.

938
01:25:03,090 --> 01:25:07,584
<i>- And I said Jehu was a liar.
- Callie-</i>

939
01:25:07,695 --> 01:25:11,256
<i>- He didn't like being called a liar.
- Callie, open the door!</i>

940
01:25:20,608 --> 01:25:22,667
Callie!

941
01:25:36,857 --> 01:25:39,553
- Where you goin'?
- To find Jehu.

942
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:42,128
Don't. You don't
owe me anything.

943
01:25:42,229 --> 01:25:44,197
You paid off the loan.

944
01:25:44,298 --> 01:25:46,630
Lat, what happens to me
doesn't matter.

945
01:25:46,734 --> 01:25:49,328
AfterJehu,
it'll be some other man.

946
01:25:49,437 --> 01:25:52,998
I'm not worth risking anything for.
Go home where you belong.

947
01:25:55,743 --> 01:25:58,541
No, Callie. I-

948
01:25:58,646 --> 01:26:00,876
I can't go home yet.

949
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:22,328
Evenin', Lat.

950
01:26:22,436 --> 01:26:25,200
- Reckon we're gonna have some rain?
- Maybe.

951
01:26:25,306 --> 01:26:27,706
They tell me up in Helena
they got the streets all paved.

952
01:26:27,808 --> 01:26:30,538
- Is that right?
- That's what they say.

953
01:26:30,644 --> 01:26:34,011
Got an opry house,
too, and gaslights.

954
01:26:34,115 --> 01:26:36,606
Sure gonna be a different life
for you and the missus.

955
01:26:36,717 --> 01:26:39,083
You'll be up there
with the high and the mighty.

956
01:26:39,186 --> 01:26:43,384
I'll never forget the first time
you rode into Fort Brock.

957
01:26:43,491 --> 01:26:47,552
You and that fella from Texas.
What was his name?

958
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:50,425
- Butler.
- Yeah, Butler. Yeah.

959
01:26:50,531 --> 01:26:54,695
- And all you owned was a horse.
- That's right.

960
01:26:54,802 --> 01:26:57,270
Well, a fella has to make up
his mind what he wants...

961
01:26:57,371 --> 01:26:59,703
and just go right out
and get it.

962
01:26:59,807 --> 01:27:02,708
That's all that counts-
gettin' there.

963
01:27:02,810 --> 01:27:05,802
That's what folks in this town
admire you for, Lat.

964
01:27:05,913 --> 01:27:09,041
You got there.

965
01:27:09,150 --> 01:27:11,983
So I'm a success.
Is that it, George?

966
01:27:12,086 --> 01:27:14,714
That's it.
People don't go around admirin' failures.

967
01:27:14,822 --> 01:27:18,986
There's too many of'em.
And don't you worry none about my vote.

968
01:27:19,093 --> 01:27:21,721
It's as good as cast
and in the ballot box.

969
01:27:21,829 --> 01:27:23,797
Night, Lat.

970
01:27:23,898 --> 01:27:25,866
Good night, George.

971
01:27:45,519 --> 01:27:48,317
- Where you going?
- In there.

972
01:27:48,422 --> 01:27:51,220
- I have something to settle with Jehu.
- Don't be a fool.

973
01:27:51,325 --> 01:27:55,352
Joyce is at my place with the boy.
Come home with me.

974
01:27:55,463 --> 01:27:58,261
That woman isn't worth
whatever you're thinking of doing.

975
01:27:58,365 --> 01:28:02,062
- Isn't she?
- No woman of her kind is.

976
01:28:02,169 --> 01:28:04,933
It's hopeless to think
you can do anything for her.

977
01:28:05,039 --> 01:28:07,200
You'll only be ruining
your own life.

978
01:28:07,308 --> 01:28:09,572
If she's in trouble,
give her some money.

979
01:28:09,677 --> 01:28:12,703
Money?

980
01:28:12,813 --> 01:28:14,906
That fixes everything, doesn't it?

981
01:28:15,015 --> 01:28:17,210
You're a man with a future...

982
01:28:17,318 --> 01:28:20,583
but if you go in there,
your political chances are finished.

983
01:28:20,688 --> 01:28:23,782
All you'll accomplish
is your own destruction.

984
01:28:25,693 --> 01:28:28,127
Maybe.

985
01:28:31,265 --> 01:28:34,063
For the last time, Lat,
come home with me.

986
01:28:35,136 --> 01:28:37,161
No.

987
01:28:42,476 --> 01:28:44,501
<i>Howdy, Senator.</i>

988
01:29:04,064 --> 01:29:07,158
Just lookin' for a sucker.
Take a hand?

989
01:29:07,268 --> 01:29:09,429
What's the game?

990
01:29:09,537 --> 01:29:12,005
Stud.

991
01:29:12,106 --> 01:29:14,131
Deal me in.

992
01:29:17,845 --> 01:29:20,678
Pour the senator a drink, Swede.

993
01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:24,918
Not out of that bottle.

994
01:29:30,057 --> 01:29:32,218
Something wrong
with my whiskey, Senator?

995
01:29:32,326 --> 01:29:36,990
I don't drink out of the same bottle
with a man who beats up women.

996
01:29:47,007 --> 01:29:50,807
- King high.
- Open for a five.

997
01:29:52,213 --> 01:29:54,204
I'll call.

998
01:29:54,315 --> 01:29:56,408
Senator?

999
01:29:56,517 --> 01:29:58,508
I'm in.

1000
01:29:58,619 --> 01:30:02,817
Is that your own money, Senator...

1001
01:30:02,923 --> 01:30:05,016
or a tramp's dowry?

1002
01:30:07,361 --> 01:30:11,991
<i>- Deal me out.
- Me too.</i>

1003
01:30:12,099 --> 01:30:16,661
Swede, pour the senator a drink...

1004
01:30:17,738 --> 01:30:19,968
out of that bottle.

1005
01:31:13,927 --> 01:31:15,918
Come on! Hit him!

1006
01:31:21,268 --> 01:31:25,432
Stop it! Stop this!
Stop it! Oh!

1007
01:31:30,978 --> 01:31:34,812
No! Oh, stop! Whoo!

1008
01:31:34,915 --> 01:31:37,008
Oh, Lord!

1009
01:31:42,156 --> 01:31:45,387
Oh!

1010
01:32:07,414 --> 01:32:10,042
<i>Get him good!</i>

1011
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:12,141
<i>Come on!</i>

1012
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,486
I'm trying to understand.

1013
01:34:30,958 --> 01:34:34,223
I guess I need educating,
like your cows.

1014
01:34:34,328 --> 01:34:37,161
Only with me,
it might take a little longer.

1015
01:34:45,172 --> 01:34:49,336
I told Link Gorham
I'm gonna testify at Callie's trial.

1016
01:34:49,443 --> 01:34:53,641
- It's not gonna be pleasant.
- Will it help her?

1017
01:34:53,747 --> 01:34:56,409
Link thinks it will.

1018
01:34:58,485 --> 01:35:01,818
- Will it be the truth?
- Yes.

1019
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:08,519
Then you testify.

1020
01:35:20,407 --> 01:35:22,466
You're cold.

1021
01:35:23,677 --> 01:35:25,702
Come in the house.
