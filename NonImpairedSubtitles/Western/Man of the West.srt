1
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,715
- Can I help you, pardner?
- If you please.

2
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,109
- What do you wanna do with it?
- Right up over there.

3
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,111
That's it.

4
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,876
- I guess you're leaving.
- You're a good guesser.

5
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,919
Goodbye, Willie. And thank you
for being the only man here

6
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,956
not to make an indecent proposal.

7
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,474
If I'd had my strength I might have.

8
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,839
Tell her to sing loud and watch out
for the manager's hands.

9
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,876
Good luck, Billie.

10
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,110
- Say, can a fella eat in here?
- Sure, go right on in.

11
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,398
(Horse neighs)

12
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,789
- Can you care for a horse?
- Sure.

13
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,395
Henry, got a customer.
Wants you to stable his horse.

14
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,636
That's just fine.

15
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,990
- What's your name?
- Link Jones.

16
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,550
- Link Jones? J-O-N-E-S?
- That's right.

17
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,551
Where you from?

18
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,393
Oh, west of here five days... Good Hope.

19
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,431
How much do you charge?

20
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,310
Two bits a day. A dollar in advance.

21
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,709
Tom, take care of his horse, will you?

22
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,555
Thanks.

23
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,235
- Where can a fellow wash up around here?
- Out there in back.

24
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,276
(Horse neighs)

25
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,592
(Train whistle)

26
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,750
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

27
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,800
- Ticket to Fort Worth, please.
- Yes, sir.

28
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,631
That's 8.35, sir.

29
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,230
- Here's your change.
- Thank you.

30
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,954
(Bell ringing)

31
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,835
(Train whistle)

32
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,197
Makes you want to
holler right back, don't it?

33
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,913
First one I saw, I let out a yap
you could've heard in Arkansas.

34
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,277
What do you think?

35
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,715
That's the ugliest thing I ever saw.

36
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,756
You never saw my ex-wife.

37
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,950
Is that man a friend of yours?

38
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,717
Where are you from?

39
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,553
Five days west of here,
a little settlement.

40
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,552
- What's it called?
- Sawmill.

41
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,517
Have I ever seen you before?

42
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,076
You mind if I ask your name?

43
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,314
Henry Wright.

44
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,873
And I don't know you?

45
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,758
- From a long time back, maybe?
- I said no.

46
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,920
Did you ever hear the name Dock Tobin?

47
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,357
- You're sure, now? Dock Tobin.
- I'm sure.

48
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,674
All aboard!

49
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,228
If I was you,
I'd watch out who I was talking to.

50
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,269
Look after the children
and have fun, dear. Goodbye.

51
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,958
Aboard!

52
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,758
All aboard!

53
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,070
East Fork, next stop!

54
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,549
El Paso, Fort Worth.

55
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,559
All aboard!

56
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,670
(Whistle)

57
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,351
Mind some company?

58
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,396
Name is Sam Beasley.

59
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,072
That's some country
we'll be going through.

60
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,914
Nothing but a bunch of
rattlers and tarantulas.

61
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,599
Through that area where those
important outlaws used to ride.

62
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,195
Johnny Beggs,
Dock Tobin, and all those...

63
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,155
How you doing now?

64
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,595
Oh, I'm beginning to get the hang of it.

65
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,638
Yeah, I guess a man
can get used to anything.

66
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,472
I remember once...

67
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,429
- I didn't get your name.
- Jones.

68
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,716
You must be going to Fort Worth
on a big cattle deal, Mr Jones.

69
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,314
I think, from the way
you carry yourself,

70
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,356
you're a cattleman.

71
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,036
One of my many hobbies

72
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,429
is observing the people around me.

73
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,150
Keeping my eyes open
for their peculiarities, so that I can...

74
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,835
I'm on my way to Fort Worth
to hire a schoolteacher.

75
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,630
Is that so? Well, that's pretty interesting.

76
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,437
What would a gent like you
want with a schoolteacher?

77
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,592
We're starting a school in my town.

78
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,958
Oh. Well, good for you.

79
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,870
- What town is that?
- Good Hope.

80
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,919
Good... You know you have to pay her
a year in advance

81
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,798
- to get her to come this far west.
- That's right.

82
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,270
Well, I guess that takes a little money.

83
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,756
- We've raised it.
- And they picked you to choose her?

84
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,718
I guess that's quite an honour.
Don't say that.

85
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,588
You know, it's mighty interesting

86
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,478
that you should
bump into me on this train.

87
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,232
Tickets. Tickets, please.

88
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,273
I...

89
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,557
I might be able to help you find somebody
when we get to Fort Worth.

90
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,198
Glad to have met you, Mr Jones.
See you again.

91
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,999
Hello, Billie.
Billie, you're looking very good.

92
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,913
Thanks. I thought the only thing
that looked good to you

93
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,956
was a marked deck.

94
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,474
Billie, mind if I sit down?

95
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,792
Thanks.

96
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,912
You know, it's interesting
who you meet on a train.

97
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,270
This is East Fork.
East Fork wood stop.

98
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,511
All able-bodied men
are requested to pitch in

99
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,512
and give us a hand
loading wood for the engine.

100
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,275
The more help we have,
the quicker we can get started again.

101
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,716
The Fort Worth and Chihuahua
appreciates your help.

102
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,634
- You going out to help?
- That's right.

103
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,594
I don't mean to trouble you, Mr...

104
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,475
- Jones.
- Jones!

105
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,597
But there's somebody here
I think you ought to meet.

106
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,432
Miss Ellis...

107
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,792
Miss Ellis, I'd like to present Mr Jones.

108
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,599
- How do you do, Mr Jones?
- Hello, Miss Ellis.

109
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,274
The reason I wanted you to meet Miss Ellis

110
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,237
is a strange coincidence.

111
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,154
It's pretty unusual that
the three of us are on this train.

112
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,800
I even get a creepy feeling about it.

113
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,791
You ask me why? I'll tell you.

114
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,870
Miss Ellis - that is, Miss Billie Ellis,

115
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,396
is a singer with
what you might call an operatic voice.

116
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,072
A lady of real culture.

117
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,312
But the amazing part is,
she was trained as a schoolteacher.

118
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,433
Really?

119
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,312
Now, why would Mr Jones
be interested in that?

120
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,190
Mr Jones is on this train
looking for a schoolteacher.

121
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,398
You're riding to Fort Worth to find her,
isn't that right?

122
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,716
Wouldn't that make your hair
stand up straight?

123
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,396
We ought to talk this over
while they're hauling that wood.

124
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,793
You gentlemen ought to be loading wood.
We're behind schedule.

125
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,950
Would you keep an eye on my bag?

126
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,031
Sure thing. I'll be right here.

127
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,832
Maybe we can talk
when the train pulls out.

128
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,990
Mr Jones wants to stretch his legs...

129
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,356
although I don't see why
he'd want them any longer.

130
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,396
Excuse me, Miss Ellis.

131
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,192
Beautiful job.

132
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,838
Let's see if we can stay on schedule.

133
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,230
(Screaming)

134
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,396
Let's get to the baggage car.

135
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,356
(Gunshot)

136
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,757
Let's get this thing rolling!

137
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,917
(Man) Hello? Hello?

138
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,992
(Man groaning)

139
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,429
Oh... Oh... Oh...

140
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,997
Who is it?

141
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,753
Oh, it's you. I thought it was...

142
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,795
I was running, and I fell down.

143
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,236
My heart feels as if
it's going to jump out of my chest.

144
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,916
What happened here?

145
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,588
Were they trying to...? Oh...

146
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,797
Hey, listen. I think this is busted.

147
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,273
- They were holding up the train?
- That's right.

148
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,557
How could they leave us like this?
We could starve.

149
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,388
Hey, Billie. You all right?
You hurt or anything?

150
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,389
- No.
- I hurt my ankle.

151
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,356
You wouldn't leave us out here alone,
would you, Mr Jones?

152
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,880
- Just asking.
- When is the next train?

153
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,155
Runs once a week.

154
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,709
Do you talk?

155
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,950
He just gave you the answer.

156
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,356
- You're hurt.
- It's nothing.

157
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,357
- Should have it tended to.
- No, I'm all right.

158
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,909
- Where's the nearest town?
- Maybe a hundred miles.

159
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,554
A hundred miles?
What are we going to do?

160
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,949
I guess we'll have to walk.

161
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,157
We'd better find shelter
or you two will freeze.

162
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,676
- I can't walk on this foot!
- Then I'll have to carry you.

163
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,914
I bet you're glad you've got company.

164
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,752
I wouldn't say that.

165
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,831
Oh, we'll be a comfort to you.

166
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,593
I'll sing Tenting Tonight a little off-key,

167
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,309
and Sam can teach you how to deal
off the bottom of the deck.

168
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,119
You'll be a richer and a happier man.

169
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,798
- What are you looking at?
- Your shoes.

170
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,758
My shoes?

171
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,830
That makes this trip worthwhile.

172
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,878
You're the first man
that's looked at that part of me

173
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,916
since I was 14 years old.

174
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,878
Those shoes won't last a day
out here.

175
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,076
Then I'll walk without them.

176
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,478
Still standing.

177
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,830
How did you know about it?

178
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,710
I used to live here once.

179
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,709
When you were a boy?

180
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,030
I don't know what I was.

181
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,717
Who owns this place?

182
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,588
It belonged to a nester
but somebody shot him.

183
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,036
You two go into the barn.

184
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,913
Come in.

185
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,351
The man with the gun ain't got no voice,
or he'd invite you his-self.

186
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,634
Come in!

187
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,072
Stop there.

188
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,514
Now, what can we do for you?

189
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,909
Looks like I called at the wrong time.

190
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,353
Close the door, Trout.

191
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,356
What happened to your head?

192
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,396
Fellow dropped one of those on it.

193
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,391
That's too bad.

194
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,551
Where you from?

195
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,392
West of here a ways.

196
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,233
- What's the name of the place?
- Sawmill.

197
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,235
- What do you want here?
- I got left by the train.

198
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,915
Just looking for a roof for the night.
I can move on.

199
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,753
How'd you find this place, mister?

200
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,752
Just stumbled into it.
I guess you'd call it lu...

201
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,717
Luck. (Chuckles)

202
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,030
Good or bad luck?

203
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,315
He'll be dead
by tomorrow morning.

204
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,311
He's got a hole in his back.

205
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,592
Hello, Link.

206
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,993
Come shake hands
with your Uncle Dock Tobin.

207
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,551
You've been gone a while.

208
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,272
How long has it been? Five years?

209
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,316
A lot longer than that.

210
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,517
I don't keep track of time
very good any more.

211
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,355
You look fine. Been eating good?

212
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,512
- Yes.
- That's the thing.

213
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,352
You eat good.

214
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,271
This is really something,
seeing you again.

215
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,670
I remember the day you left me.

216
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,275
Oh, Lord, do I remember it.

217
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,871
You were my right arm.

218
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,711
You ran off and left me.

219
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,633
God have mercy
on my black bloody soul.

220
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,957
(Laughs) I was so mad,

221
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,158
I could take and push your guts
right out through your back

222
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,869
and I would have done it too
if you had been standing there.

223
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,315
(Laughs)

224
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,834
I'd have opened you up wide.

225
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,631
My right arm, trained by me.

226
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,389
I put a piece of work into you.

227
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,600
Every last idea that shot
through your head was mine.

228
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,433
I remember every bloody minute of it.

229
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:24,429
The glory of Uvalde and Saltillo
and Black Fork.

230
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,750
Remember them names?

231
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,035
Ha? Uvalde?

232
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,750
God forgive us, we painted their walls
with blood that time. Oh!

233
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,879
(Laughs) Walked out of that bank
with $11,000.

234
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,316
You and me, Claude riding behind us.

235
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,073
Then we murdered
old Ben Scull together.

236
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,038
You held him, I took off the top of his head.

237
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,790
$11,000.

238
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,956
We were big! Don't you remember?

239
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,951
I remember.

240
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,196
You were my property.

241
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,874
What did you go off and leave me for?

242
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,712
I wanted to strike out on my own.

243
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,269
I needed you that time.

244
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,716
I could have killed you. We fell apart!

245
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,836
Look at these pigs.

246
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,635
This morning,

247
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,870
had a train all lined up.

248
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,750
Bank money riding on it.

249
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,870
One stinking guard!

250
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,395
And they let it get away.

251
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,437
Oh, there's no guts any more!

252
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,316
I got nobody left.

253
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,196
Just your cousin Claude.

254
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,318
He's riding over from Crosscut.
Remember Claude?

255
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,719
He's a nice, quiet, cold one.

256
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,077
He ain't changed a bit.

257
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,958
(Man whimpering)

258
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,996
That's Alcott.

259
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,593
He's got a hole in his back.
He's gonna die.

260
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,951
He wasn't much good anyway.

261
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,428
Why don't you go
and help him out, Ponch?

262
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,830
Show Link Jones here
what kind of man you are.

263
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,072
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean. Do it.

264
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,476
That's what I figured.

265
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,596
Trout! The man's gonna die anyway.

266
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,910
It's the charitable thing to do.

267
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,269
(Laughs)

268
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,359
No guts.

269
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,631
Coaley, you show Link.

270
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,359
Your father and his father
was brothers.

271
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,716
Show him what his family is like.

272
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,156
I'm waiting!

273
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,032
(AIcott choking)

274
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,873
(Gunshots)

275
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,479
Well, Link, what's gonna happen with us?

276
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,710
- Are you back with me?
- I'm back.

277
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,553
- Is that the truth?
- That's the truth.

278
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,115
Ponch, make a fire. I'm cold.

279
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,873
Dock, I've got two people with me,
they've walked all day.

280
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,236
- Coaley, bring them in.
- I'll bring them in myself.

281
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,116
He said for me to do it.

282
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,110
I said I'd bring them in.

283
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,710
All right, cousin. You bring them in.

284
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,750
Here they are, Uncle Dock.

285
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,035
- Look at the build on her.
- Yeah.

286
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,873
Her name is Miss Ellis.
This is Mr Beasley.

287
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,631
My name is Sam Beasley.

288
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,518
We can always use
another good hand, Beasley.

289
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,637
There's a man outside digging a grave.
Go help him.

290
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,636
Wait a minute.

291
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,234
- Here.
- (Men laugh)

292
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,272
- This your woman, Link?
- Yes, she's my woman.

293
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,752
I admire your taste.

294
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,479
Yeah. My name's Dock Tobin.

295
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,753
D-O-C-K Tobin.
Ever hear that name before?

296
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,197
- Yes.
- Yeah?

297
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,396
Your man used to be with me.

298
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,438
We rode together, killed together.

299
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,272
He ever tell you that?

300
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,712
Yes.

301
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,155
Did you ever tell her that, Link?

302
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,800
We're going to be together again,
isn't that so?

303
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,472
That's right.

304
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,471
You came back to ride with me.

305
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,551
- That's why I came back.
- Yeah.

306
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:56,509
He got left by the train. He's lying.
I don't like having him here.

307
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,114
You're not big enough to shine his boots.

308
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,476
- No?
- No. Keep your mouth shut.

309
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,079
- What you been doing, Link?
- Nothing much. Moving around.

310
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,799
Yeah? Where?

311
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,758
All over.

312
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,593
- All by yourself?
- All by myself.

313
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,829
Are the pickings pretty good?

314
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,476
Fair.

315
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,229
And you came all this way
just to find me, huh?

316
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,750
I was going to Fort Worth
this morning.

317
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,230
I got left and figured
I'd try to find you.

318
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,675
Remember a place called Lassoo?

319
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,039
- Yes.
- (Laughs)

320
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:20,114
The name makes my tired old heart
pump like a young boy's.

321
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,635
There's a stage bank there. Big one.

322
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,757
All the mines in the area
ship their gold through there.

323
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,638
I've been wanting to take it for years.

324
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,073
Yeah.

325
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,150
It rings in my head like a bell!

326
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,231
Lassoo!

327
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,594
Lassoo bank.

328
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,830
That's the biggest one we ever went after.

329
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,356
- Then we go to Mexico, right?
- Right.

330
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,958
What do you think of Lassoo, Link?

331
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,190
I think the same thing you do.

332
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,393
Yeah?

333
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,119
You're going to help me take it.

334
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,839
(Laughs)

335
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:14,116
Well, Link? If you're with me,
go take Alcott out and bury him.

336
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,351
I can't take no more.

337
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,829
He keeps standing there
with that rifle.

338
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,831
He never says nothing.

339
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,911
He just keeps looking at you.

340
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,117
He took my pen.
He took my watch and chain.

341
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,953
He took everything. Never says anything.

342
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,716
He'll shoot me if I stop digging.

343
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,756
- I'll dig.
- Thank you.

344
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,355
Don't jab me with that rifle.

345
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,390
Do you think we could...?
Could we maybe...

346
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,274
try to run away if we get a chance?
Just the two of us?

347
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,152
Just the two of us?

348
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,358
Go right ahead.

349
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,955
They'll run you down
and cut you up into little chunks.

350
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,472
You changed.

351
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,598
Since the minute you walked in that shack,
you changed.

352
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,274
You're a different man all of a sudden.

353
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,040
You act like you belong with these people.

354
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,591
(Shouting)

355
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,274
What's that?

356
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,999
What's that?

357
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,435
(Billie) Link!

358
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,630
(Coaley) I'd like to say some words.

359
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,756
(Ponch) Let's get this started, lady.

360
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,989
- You're just in time.
- What's going on?

361
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,679
- Your gal's gonna undress for us.
- We saved a seat for you.

362
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,870
It's gonna be a big show.

363
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,952
Who knows?
We might even get a yell out of Trout.

364
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,996
Come on in!

365
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,276
All right, lady. Do it.

366
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,710
Are you gonna do it
or should Mr Trout do it for you?

367
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,839
- Start with the shoes.
- Do it slow. We got all night.

368
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,710
Watch this, Uncle Dock.

369
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,391
Well, make her do it!

370
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,270
We're getting impatient!

371
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,316
(Glass shatters)

372
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,152
You see this?

373
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,470
Now, start taking off your clothes!

374
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,159
What's the matter with your girl, Link?

375
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,834
Maybe she wants to do it
another time.

376
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,392
It's gonna be now.

377
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,952
There's some things
we ought to talk about.

378
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,190
Start taking off your clothes.

379
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,630
We ought to talk about Lassoo.

380
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,473
That's right.

381
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,552
When Claude comes tomorrow,
we want to be ready.

382
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,156
Don't want to mess up Lassoo.

383
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,236
Link!

384
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,279
- Take that knife away, Coaley.
- You're not talking us out of this.

385
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,476
Now, undress. Start with the shoes.

386
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,516
Want to see me cut him, huh?

387
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,357
The stockings.

388
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,512
Get up.

389
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,235
That shirt thing now. Peel it off.

390
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,677
I don't have to tell you what's next, do I?

391
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,276
Come on. Come on!

392
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,992
How are you enjoying this, cousin? Huh?

393
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:40,710
Is this supposed to get you even
for losing that train today?

394
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,234
- Get that petticoat off!
- Coaley!

395
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,756
Come over here.

396
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,873
Now!

397
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,751
(Dock) What happened at that train?

398
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,389
I told you.
A guard with a.44 was cutting us down.

399
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,232
I told you before.

400
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,316
Go to sleep.

401
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,793
All of you!

402
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,908
(Laughs)

403
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,195
He's a good boy, Coaley.

404
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,315
Just a little too much fire.

405
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,791
I'm still running the show, Link.

406
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,314
I just like to prove it once in a while.

407
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,918
She's mine.

408
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,909
I want you back, Link,
but I want it the way it used to be.

409
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,352
She's mine, Dock.

410
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,676
It's all filled in.

411
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,676
You can sleep in the barn, Link.

412
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,911
And take your woman with you!

413
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,353
- Are you all right?
- You?

414
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,956
I don't know how this can happen.

415
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,639
When he...
When he took out that knife...

416
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,875
I don't even remember what I did.

417
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,549
I couldn't see their faces any more.

418
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,436
But I could feel that old man.

419
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,514
How could you have been with him?

420
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,556
You're not like them.

421
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,590
I was. There wasn't any difference at all.

422
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,670
You better try and get some sleep.

423
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,830
Link, here are some blankets.

424
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,472
My bag!

425
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,350
What are you looking for?

426
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,193
I could cut off my arm.
All that money and...

427
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,157
it wasn't even mine.

428
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,630
It belonged to a lot of poor people,
and they trusted me.

429
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,110
It took them years to save it, and now...

430
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,156
and now it's gone.

431
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,999
What's going to happen to us tomorrow?

432
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,116
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

433
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,475
I can't ever go home
unless I get that money back.

434
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,469
(Dock) Link!

435
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,755
(Dock laughing)

436
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,796
Get under these blankets.

437
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,316
(Dock) Link!

438
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,435
Hey, Link!

439
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,553
Where are you? Huh?

440
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,275
Thought I'd pay you a little visit.

441
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,190
Link?

442
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,758
(Laughing)

443
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,957
I got to thinking about you two
and how cold it was.

444
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,236
You know how the wind
whistles through here. Drink?

445
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,958
- We're all right.
- Yeah...

446
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,714
Sure you are. Sure.

447
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,115
A woman like that
ought to be sleeping in a house.

448
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,031
Isn't that right, Link?

449
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,518
She stays here.

450
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,273
(Laughs)

451
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,912
All right, Link.

452
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,878
(Laughing)

453
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,349
(Billie sobs)

454
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,957
(Door opens)

455
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,555
Claude! (Laughs)

456
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,551
Good to see you.

457
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,551
What happened to the train?

458
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,596
- We missed it.
- Who did?

459
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,796
Coaley.

460
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,350
- You know who I heard was on that train?
- Ah.

461
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,034
That's right. He's here.

462
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,475
You better get ready.
They'll be coming for us.

463
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,516
Link.

464
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,753
I never met a man like you before.

465
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,918
The men I meet

466
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,788
all think they have a right
to put their hands on me.

467
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,189
Like it comes with the introduction.

468
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,556
All those Ionely ones,
looking for some kind of special thrill...

469
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,837
I know what they're gonna say
before they say it.

470
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:43,994
Funny part is, inside me,
I'm just as Ionely as they are.

471
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,357
I don't really have anybody.

472
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,551
We're a lot alike.

473
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,315
I never had any family -
just that old man down there,

474
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,755
and he took care of me.

475
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:01,072
He taught me killing and stealing,
and I didn't know any better.

476
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,392
Then one day, I grew up.

477
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,917
You either become a human being
or rot like that bunch.

478
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,436
So I busted away.

479
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,916
I found something better.

480
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,676
I made myself a home.

481
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,951
You have a wife?

482
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,268
Yes.

483
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,995
- Children?
- Yes.

484
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,835
- How old?
- Eight and ten.

485
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,670
Eight and ten.

486
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,314
Your wife, is she pretty?

487
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,753
Yes.

488
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,512
She's lucky.

489
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,837
You better get dressed.

490
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,398
Come on, now! Load up there!

491
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,233
Come on. Shake a leg! Move!

492
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,796
Look at them, Claude.
Like old times, isn't it?

493
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,468
We're gonna do big things. I feel it.

494
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:27,792
Glory be to God, we're going
to bust out again like we used to.

495
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,916
(Laughs)

496
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,117
Just like a family of old settlers
moving on, huh?

497
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,550
Say hello to your cousin Link.

498
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,471
It was like tearing them away
from a honeymoon.

499
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,790
Claude.

500
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,632
You've changed.

501
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,674
This is Miss Billie Ellis. Claude Tobin.

502
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,395
Hello.

503
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,755
Claude, tell them what happened.

504
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,829
That train you were on yesterday

505
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,030
made a special stop at Eskota.

506
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,793
They began burning up
the telegraph wires.

507
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,519
A marshal in Crosscut saw you getting on.

508
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,954
You must have looked familiar,

509
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:25,999
so he started poking through
some real old wanted posters.

510
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,672
He found yours.

511
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,715
It's up again all over Crosscut.

512
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,439
On account of you,
they know who we are.

513
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,035
I want to thank you for that.

514
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,953
Well, I guess this is your home now, Link.

515
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,669
Dock, I want to talk to you over here.
Coaley.

516
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,753
Where I live, all the people know about me,

517
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,718
about what I did
when I was with that old man.

518
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,670
They know everything,
and they let me live it down.

519
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,990
It took a long, hard time,

520
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,475
and now I've got to do it again.

521
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,598
You know what I feel inside of me?
I feel like killing.

522
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,240
I want to kill every one of those Tobins,

523
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,156
and that makes me just like them.

524
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,594
What I busted my back
all those years trying not to be.

525
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,230
Do you know what they're talking about?

526
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,834
The new one and Coaley, they want to...

527
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,478
Quiet.

528
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,152
Shut up.

529
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,435
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

530
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:15,478
- They'll just slow us down.
- That's right.

531
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,951
I say we open them up.

532
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,951
That's what I say. Open them up.

533
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,231
What about the girl?

534
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,957
- We'll take care of her too.
- Claude.

535
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,510
This is still my outfit.

536
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,636
Link's back, and he's staying.

537
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,033
Get in the wagon.

538
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:45,549
- Dock, do you believe him?
- I don't know what I believe.

539
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,674
I'm going to find out before I get home.

540
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,960
You and Link are taking us into Lassoo.

541
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,840
- Lassoo?
- That's what I said.

542
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:01,430
Lassoo or no Lassoo,
I say we kill them and move on.

543
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,511
I'm for that. Let's do it.

544
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,796
Get in the wagon.

545
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,234
All right, let's get 'em rolling!

546
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,072
Come on, Link!

547
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,356
Whoa!

548
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,595
I want to stop here for a while.

549
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:37,557
We're going to roll all night
and all day tomorrow.

550
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,673
There's a secret to this thing, Ponch.

551
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,752
You want to learn,
you've come to the right man.

552
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,718
You got a lot of bloodshot around the eye!

553
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,472
Don't strain so.

554
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:05,997
Just listen to old Dock,
and you'll find out the...

555
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,833
You let the other man's
strength beat him.

556
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:16,473
Right, Link? You want to try next?

557
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,120
Why don't you let Coaley try first?

558
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:27,277
He might give you a little tussle
if you let him use his knife.

559
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,316
(Laughs)

560
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:33,513
Ah, you got a real sharp
sense of humour.

561
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:37,388
Yeah. I was about to say
the same thing myself, cousin.

562
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:42,315
And I think he might appreciate it
if you'd let him use that gun, too.

563
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,995
He's got his juices flowing now.

564
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:50,197
- Look at him!
- All right, say it all.

565
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,077
If you wanted to make it even

566
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:56,358
you could let him
come up on you from behind.

567
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,635
Let's see you do it, Coaley.

568
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,153
Turn around.

569
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:22,350
I want him to be comfortable.
Let's do it your way.

570
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,398
How's that feel, cousin?

571
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,074
(Horses whinny)

572
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,598
Now I'm gonna undress you, Coaley.

573
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,831
That's what you said to her, isn't it?

574
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,274
(Coaley yells)

575
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:35,352
Isn't that what you said to her?
Boots first.

576
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,756
(Coaley yelling)

577
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,435
(Coaley) I'm gonna kill you!

578
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:13,590
- How does it feel, huh?
- I'm gonna kill you!

579
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,516
Take the clothes off.

580
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:21,596
Take your clothes off.

581
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,990
I can't.

582
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,116
I can't do it.

583
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:58,599
Well, I never saw anything
like that in all my life.

584
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,597
Link, that was something
to make an old man's blood boil.

585
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,478
I thought you were gonna
choke him to death!

586
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:09,233
Just like the old days in Uvalde.

587
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:12,278
Did you see him rip the clothes off him?

588
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:15,830
Kill him! I'm gonna kill him!

589
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,753
- Coaley, put that down.
- I'm gonna kill him!

590
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,876
I said put that down!

591
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,996
I don't care what you say.

592
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,593
Stop!

593
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:27,478
You don't mean nothing to me.

594
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:28,913
Stop it!

595
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,392
I'm going to kill you, Link.

596
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,075
You can't make fun of me.
You can't make fun of me.

597
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,878
Stop!

598
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:04,757
I don't know what's come over me lately.

599
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,991
I've never done a thing like this before.

600
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:11,718
I mean, I don't fight
or anything like that.

601
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,193
I tell you, though, it was a shrewd move.

602
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:21,349
You see, I figured without you around here

603
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,476
they'd have killed me for sure.

604
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:26,233
I'd have laid three, four to one on that.

605
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:30,314
So I... So I just...

606
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:14,150
Don't you talk any more, Claude?

607
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,398
We used to talk, you and me,
when we were kids.

608
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,913
What happened?

609
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:25,557
Things have kind of gone to hell,
haven't they?

610
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:29,155
And you're still at it.
Stealing and killing and running.

611
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,276
That's right.

612
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:35,395
It doesn't make any sense.

613
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,755
I figured you'd have grown out of it.

614
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:40,434
How can you let
that old man do this to you?

615
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,192
He's out of his mind.

616
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,919
Don't you talk about that old man.

617
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,719
I been with him all my life.
He's my family.

618
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,953
Yeah, he's going
a little soft in the head,

619
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:54,315
but I can say that. You can't.

620
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,550
You got no rights here no more.

621
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:02,470
I'll tell you, I prayed
for him to let Coaley kill you,

622
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:06,348
but he didn't. He just don't
see things so clear no more.

623
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:11,275
Years ago, nobody could have done
what you're trying to do now.

624
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,397
Not even you. He would have
known it in ten seconds

625
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,436
and blown your head off in 20.

626
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,319
- You like it?
- I like it.

627
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,556
- Claude...
- Will you shut up?

628
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,629
Do you know what he did
the day you left?

629
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:32,429
He cried. That's right. I saw him.

630
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:35,675
Big tears running down his face.

631
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:40,470
Now you're back and trying
to make him think it's for real.

632
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,630
He wants that so bad it hurts him.

633
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,835
Well, you ain't got me fooled.

634
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,955
You see, I watch out for that old man.

635
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:52,598
I love him, and I watch out for him.

636
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,551
You're not gonna make it, Link.

637
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:02,239
I swear that. You're not gonna make it.

638
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:29,915
Go on!

639
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:57,955
Tomorrow morning, we hit Lassoo.

640
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:04,633
I've been looking off into the dark,
and I saw the job happening.

641
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:07,280
It made me feel so cold,

642
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:10,477
I thought I was standing in ice water
up to my neck.

643
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:15,000
I saw all there was in Lassoo...

644
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,554
100 yards of shacks and dust

645
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:23,395
with the Stageline bank at the end of it.

646
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,436
Ha!

647
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,875
There's more money in the Lassoo bank

648
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,872
any of you ignorant dogs ever could count!

649
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:37,591
Now, listen to me. Got this in front of me.

650
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,673
Tomorrow morning,
a man rides into the bank.

651
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:45,718
He carries a satchel with him. He's polite...

652
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,870
quiet.

653
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,997
Asks them at the bank
to hold the satchel for him.

654
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,988
Then he thanks them, and he goes out,

655
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,395
and he knows who's in the bank,

656
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:02,552
how many guns they've got,
whether we can take it or not.

657
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,672
Now, listen to me good.

658
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,713
If we can take it, he waits there for us.

659
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,756
If we can't, he rides back.

660
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:17,152
If he's not back in four hours,
we know he's waiting for us,

661
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,992
and we ride in.

662
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:23,109
He meets us outside the town,

663
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,430
lays the whole thing out for us.

664
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,432
We go in, blow the place to bits.

665
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:33,996
We ride out of there rich,
fat, laughing like babies!

666
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,957
There's nothing to forget
and nothing to go wrong.

667
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,156
Nothing to mess up.

668
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,993
All it takes to make this work is guts.

669
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:48,589
Who's got 'em?

670
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,636
Which man rides in first?

671
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,430
I do.

672
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,313
Why you, Link?

673
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,235
Who else is there?

674
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:12,875
Trout? He can't talk.

675
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,477
Ponch?

676
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:21,950
He can't think. You wouldn't
send him on a man's job.

677
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,717
Claude, how many years
you been riding this territory?

678
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,758
They know your face in Lassoo,
don't they?

679
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,796
Don't they, Claude?

680
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,637
And you couldn't ride
five steps into that town.

681
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:41,712
They'd be lined up
waiting to crack you down.

682
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,078
So that leaves me.

683
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,830
All right, Link. You ride in first.

684
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:00,430
You take Trout along with you.

685
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,916
I'm going in alone.

686
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,072
Being with Trout is like being alone.

687
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:17,233
You start out at sunup.
Ponch and Claude go in at noon.

688
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:45,552
What will you do?

689
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:49,315
I don't know. We'll have to
wait and see what happens.

690
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:01,871
You know, it's funny, Link.

691
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:08,270
The last two days, you've lost
everything you've ever lived for,

692
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:11,318
and I've found something
I wanted all my life.

693
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,516
I love touching you...

694
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:27,999
but what hurts is that I can't keep
what I've found, can I?

695
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:31,838
Can I, Link?

696
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,238
You don't have to ask me that, do you?

697
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:41,673
You know what I'll say.

698
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,751
Yes, I know.

699
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:48,950
If we stay alive
and you get the money back,

700
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,837
then you'll go home.

701
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,877
Won't you, Link?

702
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,432
Yeah.

703
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,954
After you leave the bank...

704
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,792
kill him.

705
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,196
You look good up there, Link.

706
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,157
That's where you belong.

707
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,759
I'd give my eyes to go on this one.

708
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,876
If it was ten years back, I'd...

709
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:51,871
Get out of here.

710
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,997
If anything happens to the girl
when I'm away...

711
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:58,636
Do you hear me, Dock?

712
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:01,396
Nothing's gonna happen, Link.

713
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,956
So this is Lassoo.

714
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:26,517
Who are you? Please, go out.

715
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:30,513
Lady, we just wanted to leave
some money at the bank here.

716
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:33,319
There's no bank here.
There's nothing here.

717
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:36,710
Just me and my husband.
Please, vayase. Go.

718
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,872
- Where's everybody gone to?
- I don't know.

719
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:43,509
They build a new stagecoach place
when the mines close.

720
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,716
Everybody's gone. I don't know.

721
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,633
I'm afraid! Please, go back! Please!

722
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,950
Lady, we're not going to hurt you!

723
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,351
(Trout howls)

724
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:59,598
Link!

725
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:10,669
I want to see you, cousin!

726
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:12,796
Over here, cousin!

727
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:21,836
We're gonna kill you, Link!

728
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:27,393
- That's a promise!
- You sound a little shaky, Claude.

729
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:29,232
Are you nervous?

730
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,117
Agh!

731
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,716
Claude?

732
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:26,076
Claude, where are you?

733
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:34,992
All alone now, Claude...

734
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:38,912
Just you and me.

735
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,436
My leg...

736
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,596
My leg's gone!

737
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,356
You got to come to me, Link!

738
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:59,950
This is the moment, Claude.

739
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:03,634
You've been planning for it all your life.

740
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:05,711
Now it's finally here.

741
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:09,760
Just like you knew it always would be.

742
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,955
You got to come to me!

743
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:32,636
It could have been so different.

744
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:36,957
You coming, Link?

745
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:49,355
(Gunshots)

746
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,276
Senor, que paso?

747
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:12,957
I'm sorry.

748
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,193
Juanita.

749
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:26,196
Juanita. Mi Juanita.

750
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,556
(Sobbing) Mi Juanita.

751
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:38,876
Billie.

752
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:44,316
Billie.

753
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:49,354
Link.

754
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:52,830
Link... Link.

755
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:00,157
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

756
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:03,916
(Dock) Link!

757
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:07,391
Link, where are they?

758
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:11,032
They're dead!

759
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:17,799
- You killed them all?
- I killed 'em!

760
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:22,792
Claude? You killed Claude?

761
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:25,231
Yes! Claude!

762
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:29,630
I'm coming to get you, Dock!
I'm gonna take you in!

763
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:59,598
Dock!

764
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,555
Listen to me, Dock!

765
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:06,679
Claude and Ponch and Trout
are lying in the street at Lassoo.

766
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:08,872
Lassoo's a ghost town,

767
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:12,316
and that's what you are, Dock, a ghost.

768
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:15,873
You've outlived your kind
and your time,

769
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:17,916
and I'm coming to get you!

770
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:22,192
All right, shoot me!

771
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:25,634
I got no one left any more!

772
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,436
Go ahead and shoot me!

773
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:33,435
I'm gonna take you in, Dock.

774
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:37,034
You lost your taste for it!

775
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:40,149
You don't like it any more!

776
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,631
Shoot me!

777
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:44,438
Come on!

778
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,636
Shoot! Shoot!

779
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:49,473
Shoot!

780
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:05,949
They'll probably give you a medal.

781
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:12,990
What are you going to do now?

782
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,315
What I always do, sing.

783
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,352
- Billie...
- Link.

784
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:28,228
I never loved anybody or anything
in my whole life before.

785
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:32,637
I always wondered what it felt like.
Now I know.

786
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:35,671
I know there's no hope for us.

787
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,355
But I wouldn't change this feeling,

788
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,396
not for anything.
