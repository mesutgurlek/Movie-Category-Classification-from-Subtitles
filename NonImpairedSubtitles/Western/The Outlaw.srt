1
00:01:54,895 --> 00:01:57,329
Doc Holiday just got off
the stagecoach.

2
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:05,565
- Want me and the boys to come along?
- Why do you ask that?

3
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:09,097
Well, I certainly wouldn't want to
fool around with him alone.

4
00:02:09,176 --> 00:02:12,839
I don't blame ya, but I'm not gonna
make any trouble for Doc Holiday.

5
00:02:12,913 --> 00:02:14,574
He's my best friend.

6
00:02:14,648 --> 00:02:17,742
As long as I'm sheriff around here
the place is his.

7
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,725
Hi. Where's Doc Holiday?

8
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:28,727
In here, Pat.

9
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:36,459
Hi, Pat.
Gosh, I'm glad to see you.

10
00:02:36,536 --> 00:02:38,367
Doc, how are you?

11
00:02:38,438 --> 00:02:40,770
You're looking plenty sassy.

12
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:43,139
You wintered kind of fat,
didn't you?

13
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,941
- What are you doing over this way?
- I wanted to have a talk with you.

14
00:02:47,013 --> 00:02:50,710
The other is, have you seen anything
of a little strawberry roan?

15
00:02:50,784 --> 00:02:52,877
- Somebody steal your horse?
- Yeah.

16
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:54,887
Cutest little fellow you ever saw.

17
00:02:54,955 --> 00:02:58,550
Mean as mean, but I'd dote on him
like he was pure rock candy.

18
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,590
- What are you laughing at?
- Joke's on whoever done it.

19
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,601
First time I ever felt sorry
for a horse thief.

20
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,662
- Did you hear he was headed this way?
- Yeah.

21
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,402
Put that on the table in there.
What are you gonna have?

22
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:19,912
I started with rye.
I don't see no cause to change.

23
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,916
- Where you been keeping yourself?
- Mostly across the border.

24
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:25,975
That's what I want to see you about.

25
00:03:26,052 --> 00:03:29,886
I need a little money and I thought
you might want to come in with me.

26
00:03:31,157 --> 00:03:33,682
- What's the matter?
- I'll let you have the money...

27
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,595
but if the deal is like that last one
of yours, better not tell me about it.

28
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:40,496
Why not?

29
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:55,246
- Where'd you get that thing?
- They stuck it on me little while ago.

30
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:58,682
You're the last man I ever thought
would be so easily satisfied.

31
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:01,915
Man's gotta settle down sometime.

32
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:08,821
Mike, did you see anything
of a strange strawberry roan?

33
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:13,127
About 13 hands high
and as cute as bug's ear.

34
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:17,959
Seems to me I did see one
about that size.

35
00:04:18,038 --> 00:04:21,474
- When I came on duty.
- Where?

36
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,203
- Up in front of the dentist place.
- Where's that?

37
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:25,869
I'll show you.

38
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:34,812
I'm only gonna tell you once more.

39
00:04:34,888 --> 00:04:37,652
You put that glass...

40
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:40,454
on top of your head.

41
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:42,495
But what are you gonna do then?

42
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:45,554
Just put it up on your head.
I'll show you.

43
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:50,562
Best thing in the world
for that dandruff of yours.

44
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:52,571
Wait a minute, Doc.

45
00:04:54,874 --> 00:04:56,808
Hello, Fred.

46
00:04:58,244 --> 00:04:59,836
Hello, Pat.

47
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:04,241
You're still using that one, huh?

48
00:05:04,317 --> 00:05:08,651
My old standby.
Never has failed yet.

49
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:14,654
How many fingers do you see, Fred?

50
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:19,027
I guess I better take Fred to the jail
and let him sober up there.

51
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:22,364
You go ahead. The dentist's place
is up the street near the corner.

52
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:24,699
I'll be along in a minute.

53
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:51,096
Well, Red, how ya feelin'?

54
00:05:57,303 --> 00:05:59,703
Hello.

55
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:03,300
- Nice little horse you got here.
- I think so.

56
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:07,506
- Where'd you get him?
- Bought him in Santa Fe Springs. Why?

57
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,175
Somebody stole him from me
in Sacora.

58
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,187
If it wasn't for those two guns,
I'd say you was hiding in pretty young.

59
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:22,594
- You think it was me?
- You haven't told me any different.

60
00:06:22,662 --> 00:06:24,220
I ain't going to.

61
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:27,699
My name's Holiday.

62
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:31,269
Doc Holiday?

63
00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:34,769
- I've heard of you.
- Thanks.

64
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:38,106
I don't want to
take advantage of you.

65
00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:41,272
Thanks. I thought it'd be
the other way around.

66
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:43,212
What's your name, son?

67
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:46,047
Bonny. William Bonny.

68
00:06:47,187 --> 00:06:51,419
- Billy the Kid, huh?
- Still think I stole your horse?

69
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:55,757
- How much did you pay for him?
- Wouldn't do any good if I told you.

70
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:59,230
- Why not?
- I like the horse and got used to him.

71
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:01,790
- So have I.
- I don't blame you.

72
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:04,393
- Just like sitting in a rocking chair.
- Now look...

73
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:06,996
- Hear you're pretty good.
- That's what I hear about you.

74
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:09,803
All right. You mind standing away
from the front of that horse?

75
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:12,208
Pretty sure of yourself,
aren't you?

76
00:07:12,278 --> 00:07:14,906
No sense in going to
all this trouble for nothing.

77
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:16,608
That's right.

78
00:07:16,683 --> 00:07:18,617
Hello, Doc.

79
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:20,380
Had any luck?

80
00:07:21,387 --> 00:07:24,379
- Yes and no.
- It's your horse, ain't it?

81
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:26,049
It was.

82
00:07:27,227 --> 00:07:29,127
You're a cool one.

83
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:32,926
Better get you over to the hoosegow
before this gets around.

84
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:36,298
Come along. Thanks, Doc,
for being so forbearing.

85
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:37,700
All right.

86
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:40,763
See why I left off?
He's just a kid.

87
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,604
I told you to come along.
Didn't you hear what I said?

88
00:07:43,676 --> 00:07:45,667
I heard you.

89
00:07:45,745 --> 00:07:47,838
You're not doing any better
than I did.

90
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:52,283
Wait a minute. I'd like to make you
acquainted with this young man.

91
00:07:52,352 --> 00:07:54,877
Billy, this is an old friend
of mine, Pat Garrett.

92
00:07:54,954 --> 00:07:56,979
Pat, this is Mr. William Bonny.

93
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:07,891
I've been wanting to meet you
for a long time.

94
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:09,901
How are you, Billy?

95
00:08:14,941 --> 00:08:17,341
How many fingers do you see?

96
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,469
You ought to use that
only on friends.

97
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:24,449
While you two are talking I better
put my horse away. Back up, boy.

98
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:27,611
- Why you...
- Hold it. Don't fly off the handle.

99
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:35,554
Nice little horse, ain't he, Doc?

100
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:52,907
- Remember me?
- Where's Mr. Garrett?

101
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:57,075
I sent him home. How 'bout you and me
having a little talk?

102
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:01,780
I don't believe in talk, unless
the other fella holds all the cards.

103
00:09:02,722 --> 00:09:07,182
Sonny, that head of yours
sure is screwed on tight.

104
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,959
If it wasn't, somebody would have
knocked it off long ago.

105
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:17,469
I guess that's right. How did you know
Pat was gonna hit you out there?

106
00:09:17,537 --> 00:09:22,133
Well, it's the first time a sheriff
ever wanted to shake hands with me.

107
00:09:25,812 --> 00:09:29,145
- He heard you say "shake hands."
- Huh?

108
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:36,288
How do you do, Mr. Horse?
I'm pleased to meet you.

109
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:42,126
I'll swear, I didn't know
he could do tricks.

110
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:44,288
What else can he do?

111
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:48,562
You back up there and I'll make him take
those gloves right out of your belt.

112
00:09:51,304 --> 00:09:53,568
Over that way a little.

113
00:09:54,874 --> 00:09:57,308
Now back a little farther.

114
00:09:58,978 --> 00:10:01,208
That's far enough, kid.

115
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:03,715
Put your hands up.

116
00:10:03,783 --> 00:10:05,717
All right, Doc.

117
00:10:14,294 --> 00:10:17,786
- This is new for you, ain't it?
- What?

118
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:20,492
Bein' arrested for horse stealin'.

119
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:23,694
Doc, you know I didn't steal that horse
any more than you did.

120
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:30,206
Billy, many a true word
is spoken in jest.

121
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:36,974
This is something new
for you too, isn't it, Doc?

122
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,177
Yeah, what's that?

123
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:43,518
The Great Doc Holiday
getting someone else to help him.

124
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:47,022
And a policeman at that.

125
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:51,763
I can hardly believe it.

126
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:55,992
And after the way I've heard
people talk about you...

127
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:58,765
ever since I was in short pants.

128
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:01,363
That's enough of that.
Turn around.

129
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:04,069
- Now walk out that door.
- Wait a minute.

130
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:05,633
Why?

131
00:11:05,712 --> 00:11:09,307
Well, this thing don't seem to sit
right on my stomach, no how.

132
00:11:09,382 --> 00:11:10,974
What?

133
00:11:12,185 --> 00:11:15,712
Doc, you're not gonna
back out on me?

134
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:18,754
I'm afraid I am.

135
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:21,419
I'd never hear the end of this.

136
00:11:24,063 --> 00:11:27,658
Hold on!
I'm not through with you yet.

137
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:31,634
Step aside, Doc.
He may shoot me in the back.

138
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:34,935
They tell me that's the way
you've given it to some of the boys.

139
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:38,068
Now, Pat, that's
a pretty strong thing to say.

140
00:11:38,144 --> 00:11:40,237
I never heard that.

141
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:44,840
Well, Mr. Garrett,
if you believe that...

142
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:48,011
here's your chance
to do the same to me.

143
00:11:55,962 --> 00:11:57,395
Coming, Doc?

144
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:07,668
I think I will.

145
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:51,114
I want the two of you
out of this town by sundown.

146
00:12:51,184 --> 00:12:52,981
What did I do?

147
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:55,418
That's all right, Doc.

148
00:12:55,488 --> 00:12:58,218
You've got the right
to choose your friends.

149
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:05,363
Shucks. I don't take kindly
to that at all.

150
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:08,059
He knows there's no stage
until tomorrow...

151
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:10,796
and he knows that I'm afoot.

152
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,804
Or am I?

153
00:13:13,973 --> 00:13:16,771
- Not by a darn sight.
- You mean that, son?

154
00:13:16,843 --> 00:13:20,335
Sure. We'll dig you up
another horse somewhere.

155
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,192
- I guess that's enough for me.
- Cleaned out?

156
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:20,205
Not quite.

157
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:28,541
- Where you stoppin', son?
- I got a room at the hotel.

158
00:14:28,614 --> 00:14:30,639
Doc, could I see you a minute?

159
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:32,911
Sure. You might as well
cash me in.

160
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:34,577
All right.

161
00:14:38,691 --> 00:14:40,625
What's on your mind, son?

162
00:14:40,693 --> 00:14:44,424
No offense, Doc,
but that last ace you just drew...

163
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:46,522
What about it?

164
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:49,295
I got a feeling I saw it
on the bottom of the deck.

165
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:53,304
- Are you sure?
- Wouldn't have asked if I was.

166
00:14:53,372 --> 00:14:55,431
That's where you showed good sense.

167
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:58,272
Here you are, Doc... 640.

168
00:14:58,344 --> 00:14:59,936
Thanks.

169
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:05,610
You could have paid four times
for the horse and still saved money.

170
00:15:05,685 --> 00:15:08,245
That's right.
Hope you're satisfied now.

171
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:10,653
- You gonna turn in?
- I think I will.

172
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:14,352
I'll walk down to the hotel with you.
Good night, gents, and thanks.

173
00:15:14,427 --> 00:15:16,019
Good night.

174
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,139
If you're not already fixed up,
you can bunk with me tonight.

175
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:29,003
No thanks, Billy.

176
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:32,567
I've got a girl. She and her aunt
just moved into town.

177
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,680
You got a girl?

178
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:40,207
I ain't got nothin',
except that horse.

179
00:15:40,286 --> 00:15:44,985
You can't fool me. A good-looking boy
like you must have a girl somewhere.

180
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:47,651
No. I don't trust 'em.

181
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:50,989
You're pretty young
to talk like that.

182
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:53,463
Well, I've known quite a few.

183
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:57,161
And they all did you dirty, eh,
every one of them?

184
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:59,727
Yeah, every one of 'em.

185
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:02,672
That's too bad, Billy.

186
00:16:02,742 --> 00:16:06,007
I guess things haven't been
so easy for you, have they?

187
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:10,077
Tell you what I'm going to do.

188
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:13,983
Since that horse means so much to you,
I'm going to make you a present of him.

189
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:17,079
That's awful nice of you.
Thanks a lot.

190
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:20,023
All right. Good night.
See you in the morning.

191
00:16:20,092 --> 00:16:21,218
Good night.

192
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,204
Just thought I'd say good night
to the horse.

193
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,147
If you're all through, you might as well
put him back in his stall.

194
00:17:18,317 --> 00:17:19,807
All right.

195
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,580
Good night, Red.
See you tomorrow.

196
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:25,317
What, no kiss?

197
00:17:25,391 --> 00:17:27,484
He don't like mush.

198
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,824
Back in your stall, Red.

199
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:37,027
- That's my tobacco, isn't it?
- I think it is.

200
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:39,594
You don't mind if I take that,
do you?

201
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:54,616
Red, I think I'll bunk right here
tonight, if you don't object.

202
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:44,754
Say, what is this anyway?

203
00:20:44,823 --> 00:20:47,849
What are you shooting at me for?

204
00:20:47,927 --> 00:20:49,861
Are you crazy?

205
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:00,705
Stop it.
Cut it out, do you hear?

206
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:04,606
Can you understand English?

207
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:09,639
What's your name?

208
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:12,343
- Rio.
- What's the rest of it?

209
00:21:12,418 --> 00:21:13,646
McDonald.

210
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:25,563
Where'd you come from?

211
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:27,998
What do you care?

212
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:30,934
- Where'd you live before you came here?
- Sacora.

213
00:21:36,241 --> 00:21:39,642
Oh, yeah. Who was he?

214
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,509
My brother.

215
00:21:45,517 --> 00:21:48,213
He shouldn't have taken
so much tequila.

216
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:54,282
- What became of the girl?
- She married a guy two weeks later.

217
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,329
Well, that's the way it is.

218
00:21:57,396 --> 00:22:01,457
How'd I know he was your brother?
It was him or me.

219
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:04,661
And I didn't lay for him
in no barn neither.

220
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,377
- I'm sorry I was so rough with you.
- You didn't hurt me.

221
00:22:14,446 --> 00:22:16,573
You sure?

222
00:22:19,351 --> 00:22:22,343
- It's too bad I didn't know.
- What?

223
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:25,390
- He was your brother.
- What's that got to do with it?

224
00:22:25,457 --> 00:22:29,723
Well, maybe I wouldn't have tried
so hard to get the other girl.

225
00:22:30,963 --> 00:22:32,897
Oh, you wouldn't.

226
00:22:36,902 --> 00:22:38,836
What's the matter?

227
00:22:38,904 --> 00:22:42,237
- There's a rock under here.
- Let me fix it.

228
00:22:57,423 --> 00:22:59,323
Let me go!

229
00:22:59,391 --> 00:23:02,485
Hold still, lady, or you won't
have much dress left.

230
00:23:05,197 --> 00:23:07,131
Let me go!

231
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:23,407
- He did not.
- I say he did.

232
00:23:23,482 --> 00:23:25,746
- Did you really hear him holler?
- Sure I did.

233
00:23:25,818 --> 00:23:28,116
- So did I.
- Then that ain't Billy the Kid.

234
00:23:28,187 --> 00:23:30,655
Shucks, a dentist can make
anybody holler.

235
00:23:30,723 --> 00:23:32,657
Look out.
Here he comes.

236
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,790
- Sorry to keep you waiting, Doc.
- I'm in no hurry.

237
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:39,524
- You're the Billy the Kid?
- That's what they tell me.

238
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:43,261
- See, what did I tell you?
- Wait. One at a time.

239
00:23:43,335 --> 00:23:45,735
Have you really got
20 notches in your gun?

240
00:23:45,804 --> 00:23:48,272
Is it true you got 13 Indian scalps
in your war bag?

241
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,673
Had to throw 'em away.
The moths got to them.

242
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:54,008
Tanning 'em
the best way to keep them.

243
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:56,377
- Is that a fact?
- That's what my pa told me.

244
00:23:56,448 --> 00:23:59,884
- What are you doing with that?
- Trying get bark off to make a whistle.

245
00:23:59,952 --> 00:24:03,319
- Have you sucked it?
- I sucked it till it near dry.

246
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:05,652
Can't you shoot
the insides out?

247
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,654
- Put it up on that post.
- Can't I hold it?

248
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:13,459
- Can you hold it steady?
- Sure!

249
00:24:13,532 --> 00:24:17,400
Billy, you don't have to
prove anything to me.

250
00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:19,801
It's all right.
Turn the end up a little.

251
00:24:19,872 --> 00:24:21,703
Little more.

252
00:24:23,776 --> 00:24:26,040
You hit it!

253
00:24:32,551 --> 00:24:35,042
- Don't you take aim?
- I took aim.

254
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,315
- When?
- Before I drew.

255
00:24:37,389 --> 00:24:41,155
Look, Billy, it's all right.
You fixed it fine. Thanks.

256
00:24:41,226 --> 00:24:44,855
- Glad to help.
- Anything I can do, let me know.

257
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,989
- That's a new one on me.
- What?

258
00:24:47,065 --> 00:24:48,657
Aiming before you draw.

259
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:50,565
- I've got to.
- Why?

260
00:24:50,636 --> 00:24:52,729
My hand seems to be
a little quicker than my eye.

261
00:24:52,805 --> 00:24:55,069
Well, ain't that too bad.

262
00:24:57,476 --> 00:25:00,206
- Where'd you get the horse?
- I bought this one.

263
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:02,873
- Looks all right.
- He'll do for the time being.

264
00:25:08,954 --> 00:25:11,218
Ham and eggs.
Fry the eggs on both sides.

265
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,588
I'll take the same.
Mine straight up.

266
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:18,025
How 'bout a cold hand
while we're waiting?

267
00:25:18,096 --> 00:25:19,688
How much?

268
00:25:22,201 --> 00:25:25,568
- How's that?
- Suits me.

269
00:25:25,637 --> 00:25:28,572
Before you get started
I'd like to speak to you for a minute.

270
00:25:29,775 --> 00:25:32,266
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

271
00:25:41,553 --> 00:25:44,078
- What do you want?
- Let's go in the backroom.

272
00:25:44,156 --> 00:25:45,953
Why?

273
00:25:46,024 --> 00:25:48,754
You don't know me,
but we have a mutual friend.

274
00:25:48,827 --> 00:25:50,590
Who?

275
00:25:50,662 --> 00:25:53,426
And I don't like him
any better than you do.

276
00:25:53,498 --> 00:25:55,762
Oh, Garrett, eh?

277
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:58,268
The name sounds familiar.

278
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:14,451
- Figure on staying in town tonight?
- Why?

279
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:18,080
Everybody knows that Garrett
told you to get out of town.

280
00:26:18,156 --> 00:26:21,489
Sooner or later you're gonna have
a little trouble with him.

281
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,494
I thought I might give you a hand.

282
00:26:23,562 --> 00:26:26,258
That's very kind of you, mister.

283
00:26:26,331 --> 00:26:29,266
Listen. I ain't doing you
no favor.

284
00:26:31,603 --> 00:26:33,537
It'll be a pleasure.

285
00:26:35,274 --> 00:26:40,234
Now what I figure is when he's arguing
with you, he won't watch anyone else.

286
00:26:40,312 --> 00:26:42,940
So, it'll be a cinch for me.

287
00:26:43,015 --> 00:26:45,950
Be careful you don't knock me over
with the same bullet.

288
00:26:46,018 --> 00:26:48,578
Don't worry.
I'll stand at an angle.

289
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:50,588
I'll do it like this.

290
00:26:54,426 --> 00:26:57,725
Suppose this chair
is Garrett there.

291
00:26:57,796 --> 00:27:00,526
And if you're standing about
where you are...

292
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:03,830
why, I'll be over here.

293
00:27:05,037 --> 00:27:08,495
Do you mind if I draw my gun
so you can see the line of fire?

294
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:10,507
No, go right ahead.

295
00:27:24,756 --> 00:27:27,020
- It's me, Billy.
- Come on in, Doc.

296
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:34,695
- What happened?
- He's a pretty smart hombre.

297
00:27:38,003 --> 00:27:39,595
You know him?

298
00:27:39,671 --> 00:27:44,199
He's been hanging around trying to talk
Garrett into making him a deputy.

299
00:27:45,344 --> 00:27:48,074
I guess he figured if he got Billy
he'd be a hero...

300
00:27:48,146 --> 00:27:52,082
he could have the deputy job,
or run for governor if he wanted it.

301
00:27:54,353 --> 00:27:57,550
- Better get out of here, son.
- Why? He pulled on me first.

302
00:27:57,622 --> 00:28:00,955
- Be hard to make Garrett believe that.
- We'll see.

303
00:28:26,518 --> 00:28:28,577
Where's my dough?

304
00:28:30,188 --> 00:28:33,123
Well, I guess I must've
picked it up.

305
00:28:35,994 --> 00:28:38,986
You're foolish to stick around, son.

306
00:28:39,064 --> 00:28:42,192
I think I'd be more foolish
to pull out.

307
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:44,861
Then Garrett would be sure
that was my fault.

308
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:48,901
Come on. Cut for deal.

309
00:28:48,974 --> 00:28:51,943
- You meant you want to play poker.
- That's right.

310
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:02,945
You're not worried about me
if I tangle with Garrett, are you?

311
00:29:04,456 --> 00:29:06,390
Fights pretty good.

312
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:09,484
I know him better than you do.

313
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:12,689
All right, if he's so good...

314
00:29:12,764 --> 00:29:15,961
then you'll get your horse back,
won't you?

315
00:29:16,034 --> 00:29:18,298
Say, I never thought of that.

316
00:29:37,722 --> 00:29:39,656
What's the matter?

317
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:45,821
Nothing.

318
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:52,669
- Lend me a hundred.
- I never lend money in a poker game.

319
00:29:52,737 --> 00:29:55,137
Spoils my luck.

320
00:29:55,207 --> 00:29:58,472
But I'd be glad to have you
put up the horse for a hundred.

321
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,414
I guess you would.

322
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:15,559
Hello, Pat.

323
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:34,201
Care for a bite to eat, boys?
A little hand of poker?

324
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:36,213
No thanks, Doc.

325
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:42,944
Were you in there
when it happened?

326
00:30:44,422 --> 00:30:47,619
No. But listen, Pat,
he pulled on Billy first.

327
00:30:47,692 --> 00:30:51,150
- How do you know?
- His gun was on the floor.

328
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:53,459
That don't prove nothing.

329
00:30:57,769 --> 00:31:02,103
Pat, you've got an ugly temper and
you're letting it get the best of you.

330
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,300
You have no right to hold Billy
for this killing, and you know it.

331
00:31:05,377 --> 00:31:08,073
You're just sore at him,
that's all.

332
00:31:08,146 --> 00:31:12,378
Doc, I'm gonna give you a chance
to stay out of this.

333
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:15,749
- Thanks.
- Your horse is outside. Get on him.

334
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:20,554
- Good luck to you.
- Same to you.

335
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,194
What are you waitin' for?

336
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:31,829
He's waiting for those chickens
of yours to hatch.

337
00:31:31,903 --> 00:31:34,770
Are you gonna put up a fight?

338
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:40,107
I'll tell you one thing.

339
00:31:40,178 --> 00:31:42,942
I ain't going to jail
for no killing I was pushed into.

340
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:08,970
- Thanks, Doc.
- What are you trying to do?

341
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,975
I still think that fella
pulled first on Billy.

342
00:32:15,013 --> 00:32:19,541
Are you throwing off on me again?
Then what do you call it?

343
00:32:19,618 --> 00:32:24,920
Since I figure that this is a personal
matter between you and Billy...

344
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:29,154
I don't think you ought to
bring in all this hired help.

345
00:32:31,162 --> 00:32:33,722
I only did that to keep Billy
from putting up a fight...

346
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:35,732
so I wouldn't have to kill him.

347
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:40,168
Do you stuff birds too?

348
00:32:41,906 --> 00:32:44,340
You're making a big mistake...

349
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:48,436
turning on an old friend,
all because of a little snip...

350
00:32:48,513 --> 00:32:52,279
who's never given anybody nothing
except the back of his hand.

351
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,715
Speaking of hands...

352
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,785
Come on. Let's get out of here
before this hothead makes us plug him.

353
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:05,523
He ain't gonna run me
out of town.

354
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:11,567
If you wanna hold the fort while
I ride off on your little horse...

355
00:33:11,636 --> 00:33:13,900
it's all right with me.

356
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:22,005
Well, since you put it that way.

357
00:33:30,355 --> 00:33:32,289
Go ahead, son.

358
00:33:48,406 --> 00:33:50,670
Take it easy, Pat.

359
00:33:51,776 --> 00:33:57,544
Doc, this finishes you and me
for good and all.

360
00:33:58,983 --> 00:34:00,575
I'm sorry.

361
00:34:05,623 --> 00:34:08,615
- Can you get up, son?
- I don't know.

362
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:15,258
- Can you make it to the horse?
- I think so.

363
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:20,261
Did you see what that little horse did,
pulling me out like that?

364
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:24,461
He's a regular bird dog.
I gotta get you under cover some place.

365
00:35:24,536 --> 00:35:26,470
I'm all right.

366
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:34,000
Charlie, you better stay here
and have a look around town.

367
00:35:34,078 --> 00:35:37,605
That kid's got a bullet in him.
He ain't going far. Let's go.

368
00:36:00,772 --> 00:36:02,069
Who's that?

369
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,074
Quit that yelling.

370
00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:14,143
Get these horses out of sight.

371
00:36:39,277 --> 00:36:42,269
This is Billy the Kid.
He got a bad one on the left side...

372
00:36:42,347 --> 00:36:45,976
but the bullet didn't hit anything vital
and it came out in the back.

373
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:49,542
Don't move him at all
or the bleeding will start again.

374
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:51,714
I guess you better
cut his clothes off.

375
00:36:51,789 --> 00:36:55,088
Put a bandage on the wound
and see that it's always moist.

376
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:59,323
Keep him warm and dry.
If he gets a chill, he's a goner.

377
00:37:00,932 --> 00:37:03,457
If he goes out of his head,
tie him down.

378
00:37:03,535 --> 00:37:07,198
The neighbors hear him yelling,
tell them your aunt has smallpox.

379
00:37:07,272 --> 00:37:09,604
That'll keep them away.

380
00:37:11,376 --> 00:37:13,310
I guess that's all.

381
00:37:18,016 --> 00:37:20,610
Now do your best for this boy.

382
00:37:23,721 --> 00:37:26,952
If I can't come back,
I'll send word where I am.

383
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:29,459
And Billy can bring you along.

384
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,162
Shoo, shoo!

385
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:27,612
Face like a baby.

386
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,312
He's so hot.

387
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:37,294
He's no hotter
than your brother Julio was.

388
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,525
He's soaking wet again.

389
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,726
Get me some sheets,
Aunt Guadalupe.

390
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:45,894
Get them yourself.

391
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:50,031
- What's the matter with you?
- I wouldn't lift a finger for him.

392
00:38:58,516 --> 00:39:00,484
What's the matter?

393
00:39:00,551 --> 00:39:03,884
- Been lookin' for him around here.
- Well, ain't that too bad.

394
00:39:10,495 --> 00:39:12,986
Chico, what's the matter with you?

395
00:39:13,064 --> 00:39:15,123
He smells the blood.

396
00:39:17,235 --> 00:39:21,103
He was just getting ready
to peck his eyes out.

397
00:39:21,172 --> 00:39:23,504
You stay out of here.

398
00:39:33,685 --> 00:39:36,984
- Your name McDonald?
- What do you wanna know for?

399
00:39:37,055 --> 00:39:39,387
Why don't you wanna tell me?

400
00:39:39,457 --> 00:39:43,120
- Yes, that's my name. Why?
- Your father's name is...

401
00:39:43,194 --> 00:39:45,719
Woodruff. Charlie Woodruff.

402
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:48,288
I used to work for him
when he was Tom Motsacoro.

403
00:39:49,801 --> 00:39:53,396
Oh, yes. I guess I was
a little girl then.

404
00:39:54,872 --> 00:39:57,932
- Charlie!
- Aunt Guadalupe!

405
00:39:58,009 --> 00:40:01,137
- How you been?
- Very well. Thank you.

406
00:40:01,212 --> 00:40:04,045
You're getting fat as a pig.

407
00:40:04,115 --> 00:40:07,084
- What are you doing up here?
- I've been working with the sheriff.

408
00:40:07,151 --> 00:40:10,177
We're looking for Billy the Kid.

409
00:40:10,254 --> 00:40:12,620
You get out of here!

410
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:19,887
- Come in and sit down.
- Some other time.

411
00:40:19,964 --> 00:40:22,694
I'll drop in
the first chance I get.

412
00:40:22,767 --> 00:40:25,201
- What's wrong with that bird?
- Nothing.

413
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:28,102
I have a hen sitting under the bed
and he likes to peck at her.

414
00:40:28,172 --> 00:40:31,164
- Want me to get him out of there?
- No. Everything's all upset in there.

415
00:40:31,242 --> 00:40:34,302
We just got up.
Good-bye. I'm glad to have seen you.

416
00:40:34,378 --> 00:40:36,869
Same here.
So long, Aunt Guadalupe.

417
00:40:36,948 --> 00:40:40,611
- I'll walk down a ways with you.
- No, you won't. Lunch is all ready.

418
00:40:40,685 --> 00:40:42,482
Good-bye.

419
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:48,224
I'll fix you.

420
00:41:03,808 --> 00:41:05,742
How's Billy?

421
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:08,335
Looks like he's having a chill.

422
00:41:08,412 --> 00:41:10,004
A chill?

423
00:41:18,556 --> 00:41:20,649
Where are you?

424
00:41:20,725 --> 00:41:22,352
Right here.

425
00:41:22,426 --> 00:41:25,054
- Don't go away.
- I won't.

426
00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:30,366
- I'm so cold.
- I'll get you warm.

427
00:41:30,434 --> 00:41:33,301
- Don't go away.
- I'll only be a minute.

428
00:41:38,676 --> 00:41:41,270
How can you stop
a thing like this?

429
00:41:50,488 --> 00:41:52,888
- You're mad at me.
- No.

430
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:57,052
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

431
00:41:57,128 --> 00:42:00,120
- Why do you hide from me?
- I'll be right back.

432
00:42:03,334 --> 00:42:06,098
- Where's that bottle of whiskey?
- I finished it.

433
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,638
The time I had that bad cough.

434
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:20,316
I fired those hot stones for Julio,
but it was just the same.

435
00:42:22,486 --> 00:42:25,080
He shook like a leaf
till he died.

436
00:42:36,634 --> 00:42:40,035
You get out of here
and shut the door.

437
00:42:44,475 --> 00:42:45,737
What?

438
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,780
Just get out of here.

439
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,214
Have you gone crazy?

440
00:42:57,955 --> 00:43:01,413
You can bring the minister tomorrow
if it'll make you feel better about it.

441
00:43:01,492 --> 00:43:03,426
Now get out.

442
00:43:11,202 --> 00:43:14,638
You're not gonna die.

443
00:43:14,705 --> 00:43:16,639
I'll get you warm.

444
00:43:51,642 --> 00:43:54,668
Well, Red, you can't stand
this pace much longer.

445
00:43:54,745 --> 00:43:57,839
I guess I'll just have to
slow those boys down a little.

446
00:44:10,394 --> 00:44:14,194
None of my affair, but we crossed
the county line ten minutes ago.

447
00:44:14,265 --> 00:44:17,598
That's right, Swanson.
It's none of your affair.

448
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:43,225
Break up!
Scatter for those rocks!

449
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,822
You look different today.
You look better.

450
00:45:21,832 --> 00:45:24,733
Say, is that you?

451
00:45:29,306 --> 00:45:31,604
What are you doing here?

452
00:45:32,643 --> 00:45:34,406
I live here.

453
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,072
Well, I've been trying
to figure this out.

454
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:42,642
- How'd I get here?
- Doc brought you.

455
00:45:45,856 --> 00:45:49,314
Oh. Are you Doc's girl?

456
00:45:52,663 --> 00:45:55,325
What do you know about that.

457
00:45:55,399 --> 00:45:58,527
Be careful your wound.
You'll hurt yourself.

458
00:45:58,602 --> 00:46:00,763
That's right. I remember now.

459
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:04,137
- I caught one yesterday, didn't I?
- Yesterday?

460
00:46:06,911 --> 00:46:10,438
It was a month ago.
You've been terribly sick.

461
00:46:10,514 --> 00:46:13,881
A month? That's a long time.

462
00:46:13,951 --> 00:46:16,852
- How's Red?
- Red?

463
00:46:16,921 --> 00:46:20,220
- Have you been takin' good care of him?
- Who's Red?

464
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:23,260
Didn't Doc leave my horse here?

465
00:46:23,327 --> 00:46:27,593
Well, I'll swear. I didn't think
he'd do a thing like that.

466
00:46:27,665 --> 00:46:29,633
Behind my back too.

467
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:37,700
Is he all right again?

468
00:46:37,775 --> 00:46:40,039
Say, who's this old lollipop?

469
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:41,840
It's my Aunt Guadalupe.

470
00:46:41,912 --> 00:46:43,709
¿Qué tal? ¿Cómo está?

471
00:46:43,781 --> 00:46:46,477
You haven't got a ham sandwich
on you?

472
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:50,486
You hungry? I don't think we have
anything cooked beside some beans.

473
00:46:50,554 --> 00:46:53,717
That'll do for a starter,
eh, lollipop?

474
00:46:53,791 --> 00:46:56,282
Say, you don't talk
like a sick man.

475
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,294
Who said I was?

476
00:47:04,502 --> 00:47:07,266
What does that "lollipop" mean?

477
00:47:08,672 --> 00:47:10,765
Oh, something sweet.

478
00:47:10,841 --> 00:47:12,604
Sweet?

479
00:47:12,676 --> 00:47:15,873
Sweet, like candy.
You know, dulce.

480
00:47:18,782 --> 00:47:20,716
Is that a fact?

481
00:47:27,858 --> 00:47:29,792
Where are you going?

482
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:33,796
Oh, to see if I can find
a fresh egg or two.

483
00:47:46,277 --> 00:47:49,542
- How do you feel?
- Fine. When do we eat?

484
00:47:49,613 --> 00:47:52,912
- You just had lunch about an hour ago.
- Honest?

485
00:47:56,987 --> 00:47:59,785
Will you bring me my clothes?
I want to have a look around.

486
00:47:59,857 --> 00:48:02,155
What for?

487
00:48:03,694 --> 00:48:06,458
I can't spend the rest of my life
in bed.

488
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:09,761
Anyway, I want to see
if I can find my ring.

489
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:11,425
Your ring?

490
00:48:11,502 --> 00:48:15,438
Yeah. I had a ring on this finger
and it's gone.

491
00:48:15,506 --> 00:48:17,667
I've been worried about it.

492
00:48:27,918 --> 00:48:30,512
You mustn't be upset
about a thing like that.

493
00:48:30,588 --> 00:48:33,182
You can get another one,
can't you?

494
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:36,753
This one's been
kind of lucky for me.

495
00:48:36,827 --> 00:48:39,455
It belonged to a fellow who was
supposed to have had a charmed life...

496
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:41,589
as long as he kept it
on his finger.

497
00:48:43,534 --> 00:48:47,129
Then how did you get it?
Did you kill him?

498
00:48:47,204 --> 00:48:51,106
No. Somebody else did that.

499
00:48:52,443 --> 00:48:56,004
Then the ring wasn't so lucky
for him after all, was it?

500
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:00,016
Well, nothing happened to him until
he took it off to wash his hands.

501
00:49:02,052 --> 00:49:04,680
No, you better not get up
till tomorrow.

502
00:49:04,755 --> 00:49:07,622
- You said that yesterday.
- You're not strong enough yet.

503
00:49:07,691 --> 00:49:10,023
Who says I'm not?

504
00:49:12,096 --> 00:49:14,826
Billy, you mustn't.
You'll hurt yourself.

505
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,064
Then why don't you quit
wrestling with me?

506
00:49:31,115 --> 00:49:35,347
But you've been so sick.
You're not well enough. You're not...

507
00:49:51,101 --> 00:49:52,693
Rio!

508
00:49:54,438 --> 00:49:58,067
Come on. I want you to go
down to the store with me.

509
00:50:01,445 --> 00:50:03,936
I have some washing to do.

510
00:50:04,014 --> 00:50:08,007
You've got all afternoon to do it.
Come on.

511
00:50:12,423 --> 00:50:16,018
- I have to fix my hair first.
- All right, hurry up then.

512
00:50:17,261 --> 00:50:20,788
- Why do you have to go with her?
- I better.

513
00:50:20,864 --> 00:50:23,526
What if somebody should come by...

514
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,194
like that deputy sheriff friend
of yours the other day?

515
00:50:27,571 --> 00:50:31,735
Yes, that's right.
I'll go tell Aunt Guadalupe.

516
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:21,924
- Who is it?
- It's me, Doc.

517
00:51:21,992 --> 00:51:24,256
Hurry up!
Open this door here.

518
00:51:26,897 --> 00:51:28,489
Coming.

519
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:33,402
Hello, Doc.
Glad to see you, Doc!

520
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:37,497
You'd never know it. I thought
I'd have to break the door down.

521
00:51:37,574 --> 00:51:43,035
It's the rain, Doc.
I couldn't hear a thing, Doc.

522
00:51:43,113 --> 00:51:45,843
You don't need to yell so loud.
I'm not deaf.

523
00:51:45,916 --> 00:51:51,047
Did you ever see such a storm,
and it's been going on for four days?

524
00:51:52,589 --> 00:51:56,650
It was lucky for me. The only way
I could shake those bloodhounds.

525
00:51:56,727 --> 00:51:58,991
Washed out all your tracks, huh?

526
00:52:06,403 --> 00:52:07,665
Hungry?

527
00:52:07,738 --> 00:52:10,730
First sit down I've had
since I left here.

528
00:52:10,808 --> 00:52:12,435
How's Billy?

529
00:52:12,509 --> 00:52:16,275
Oh, he's fine, sure.
He's been up almost a week now.

530
00:52:16,346 --> 00:52:17,938
Good.

531
00:52:19,249 --> 00:52:20,682
Where's Rio?

532
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:30,084
So that's what
all the yellings about, eh?

533
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,720
- I'll go and call her for you.
- Wait a minute.

534
00:52:32,796 --> 00:52:35,731
You made enough noise now
to raise the dead.

535
00:52:48,045 --> 00:52:49,979
So that's it?

536
00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:54,276
All right, where is he?

537
00:52:54,351 --> 00:52:56,512
He's getting dressed.

538
00:53:00,424 --> 00:53:02,688
Maybe I better give him a hand.

539
00:53:03,961 --> 00:53:07,397
No, Doc! Please let me
talk to you first!

540
00:53:08,832 --> 00:53:12,097
What got into you? Were you drunk?
What happened to you?

541
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:14,762
I don't know.

542
00:53:14,838 --> 00:53:17,534
He's a devil.
He did the same to me.

543
00:53:17,608 --> 00:53:20,270
He can charm a bird
right out of a bush.

544
00:53:24,681 --> 00:53:28,276
- I never saw it to fail.
- Don't talk that way.

545
00:53:28,352 --> 00:53:31,378
What do you want me to say...
bless you, my children?

546
00:53:32,189 --> 00:53:34,680
You might as well.

547
00:53:34,758 --> 00:53:36,919
Huh?

548
00:53:36,994 --> 00:53:38,655
I'm married to him.

549
00:53:38,729 --> 00:53:40,526
You're what?

550
00:53:41,231 --> 00:53:43,756
That's the truth, Doc.

551
00:53:43,834 --> 00:53:46,166
Only please don't tell him.

552
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:50,306
Tell who?

553
00:53:50,374 --> 00:53:52,137
Billy.

554
00:53:52,209 --> 00:53:55,303
- You mean he doesn't know it?
- No.

555
00:53:55,379 --> 00:53:57,540
Then how could you be
married to him?

556
00:53:57,614 --> 00:53:59,605
He was out of his mind.

557
00:54:00,417 --> 00:54:03,909
I never would have done it,
only I thought he was gonna die.

558
00:54:03,987 --> 00:54:07,946
And so he would have,
if it hadn't been for you.

559
00:54:08,892 --> 00:54:10,951
I don't want his gratitude.

560
00:54:18,502 --> 00:54:21,960
Guess I should've stayed out
in the rain with the sheriff.

561
00:54:24,308 --> 00:54:28,369
- Make me a cup of coffee.
- Sure.

562
00:54:29,947 --> 00:54:32,882
It's a good thing
you don't want his gratitude.

563
00:54:34,785 --> 00:54:37,276
Why do you say that?

564
00:54:37,354 --> 00:54:39,686
You know, when I come
to think of it...

565
00:54:39,756 --> 00:54:42,782
after what you done to me,
I couldn't wish you anything better...

566
00:54:42,859 --> 00:54:45,453
than you hooking up with Billy.

567
00:54:48,165 --> 00:54:50,099
What do you mean?

568
00:54:51,234 --> 00:54:53,998
I wouldn't want
to spoil it for you.

569
00:54:58,775 --> 00:55:00,367
Hello, Doc.

570
00:55:14,424 --> 00:55:16,517
Is that all you got to say to me?

571
00:55:16,593 --> 00:55:21,326
Now look here, Doc, I'm sorry,
but it's your own fault.

572
00:55:22,566 --> 00:55:25,034
Oh, my fault, huh?

573
00:55:25,102 --> 00:55:27,935
Who brought me here?

574
00:55:28,005 --> 00:55:30,530
Now you want to switch
the blame on me.

575
00:55:30,607 --> 00:55:33,075
First you take my horse,
then my girl...

576
00:55:33,143 --> 00:55:35,873
and both times
it's all my fault.

577
00:55:35,946 --> 00:55:38,380
That reminds me of something else.

578
00:55:41,251 --> 00:55:43,845
You ran away with Red, didn't you?

579
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,445
You think that's any excuse?

580
00:55:46,523 --> 00:55:49,458
It was good enough for me.

581
00:55:49,526 --> 00:55:52,188
- There's only one trouble with it.
- What's that?

582
00:55:53,163 --> 00:55:55,631
The horse was mine too.

583
00:55:55,699 --> 00:55:59,032
I wasn't in much shape
to argue that with you, was I?

584
00:56:00,203 --> 00:56:02,694
No, I guess you weren't.

585
00:56:02,773 --> 00:56:06,903
But you didn't have use for that horse
lying flat on your back, or did you?

586
00:56:10,514 --> 00:56:13,449
All right, Doc,
if that's your way of looking at it.

587
00:56:14,851 --> 00:56:17,820
You just took the loan of him,
so to speak.

588
00:56:19,189 --> 00:56:21,123
What are you getting at?

589
00:56:21,191 --> 00:56:23,921
Yes, that's what
I'd like to know.

590
00:56:23,994 --> 00:56:26,224
You borrow from me...

591
00:56:26,296 --> 00:56:28,992
I borrow from you.

592
00:56:29,066 --> 00:56:31,261
What does that mean?

593
00:56:31,334 --> 00:56:35,771
Let's have a cup of java.
We better be getting out of here.

594
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,403
Not at those prices.

595
00:56:39,543 --> 00:56:42,979
All right, Doc,
I'll tell you what I'll do.

596
00:56:43,046 --> 00:56:45,571
What's that?

597
00:56:46,349 --> 00:56:49,614
Well, just to show you
my heart's in the right place...

598
00:56:57,194 --> 00:56:59,219
I'll let you take your pick.

599
00:56:59,296 --> 00:57:01,594
Huh?

600
00:57:01,665 --> 00:57:04,395
You mean you'd trade me
for a horse?

601
00:57:04,468 --> 00:57:08,962
It's up to Doc. After all, I've got
to think of the other fellow, you know.

602
00:57:13,176 --> 00:57:15,440
I appreciate that.

603
00:57:15,512 --> 00:57:17,104
I sure do.

604
00:57:18,448 --> 00:57:21,178
Billy, you don't mean that.

605
00:57:22,753 --> 00:57:24,880
And after all she did for you.

606
00:57:24,955 --> 00:57:29,949
Say, you should have seen what
that little horse did for me, huh, Doc?

607
00:57:31,194 --> 00:57:33,856
That's right.

608
00:57:35,499 --> 00:57:38,093
I hope you won't think
too hard of me...

609
00:57:38,168 --> 00:57:41,035
but under the circumstances...

610
00:57:41,104 --> 00:57:43,538
I'm going to take the horse.

611
00:57:43,607 --> 00:57:47,043
- You are?
- You're not satisfied?

612
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:50,045
Listen, Doc,
I like that little horse.

613
00:57:52,682 --> 00:57:54,809
What'd I tell you, huh?

614
00:57:55,952 --> 00:57:59,410
- I still can't believe it.
- What are you talking about?

615
00:57:59,489 --> 00:58:02,049
- Nothing.
- What's eating you?

616
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:03,683
Nothing!

617
00:58:17,741 --> 00:58:21,541
Here. Fill these with fresh water.
The creeks are muddy as all get out.

618
00:58:21,611 --> 00:58:23,203
How about grub?

619
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,044
Can you spare enough flour and bacon
to get us to Fort Sumner?

620
00:58:26,116 --> 00:58:28,607
Sure.

621
00:58:28,685 --> 00:58:30,812
Hey, it's clearing up.

622
00:58:30,887 --> 00:58:33,378
We better be getting out of here.

623
00:58:39,362 --> 00:58:41,353
Lend me some dough, will you?

624
00:58:41,431 --> 00:58:43,797
How much do you want?

625
00:58:51,675 --> 00:58:53,700
About 50 bucks.

626
00:58:57,347 --> 00:58:59,281
Here's 40.

627
00:59:08,325 --> 00:59:10,259
Here.

628
00:59:10,327 --> 00:59:12,921
Buy yourself a horse and buggy.

629
00:59:14,898 --> 00:59:18,026
Don't you think it's too much?

630
00:59:22,138 --> 00:59:24,732
You can give Aunt Guadalupe 20
if you want.

631
00:59:26,776 --> 00:59:29,506
If we get located in Fort Sumner,
I'll send for you.

632
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:31,171
What for?

633
00:59:32,249 --> 00:59:34,843
I can't stand ranch cooking.

634
00:59:41,324 --> 00:59:43,258
Here you are.

635
00:59:53,336 --> 00:59:55,600
- Thanks. Good-bye.
- Bye, Doc.

636
00:59:59,976 --> 01:00:01,910
Bye, lollipop.

637
01:00:05,649 --> 01:00:09,141
Bye, Billy.
Take care of yourself.

638
01:00:09,219 --> 01:00:11,153
You do the same.

639
01:00:34,978 --> 01:00:37,242
Fill these up for Doc.

640
01:00:53,596 --> 01:00:56,531
Hello, you old hay bag.
Have ya missed me?

641
01:00:59,035 --> 01:01:01,196
He's thin as a rail.

642
01:01:01,271 --> 01:01:03,831
He's been getting a little exercise.

643
01:01:03,907 --> 01:01:06,000
Where'd you get that plug?

644
01:01:06,076 --> 01:01:10,706
Wore out the black horse I had, so I
traded him to sheep herder for this one.

645
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:13,715
He's all right.
Little wild yet.

646
01:01:16,453 --> 01:01:17,647
Come on.

647
01:01:46,383 --> 01:01:48,908
Ain't Red a sweetheart?

648
01:01:48,985 --> 01:01:51,977
I'm going to let you have
a loan of him for a little while.

649
01:01:52,055 --> 01:01:55,582
- Until you get your strength back.
- You're not gonna do me any favors.

650
01:01:56,826 --> 01:02:00,091
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't wanna be obligated about Red.

651
01:02:00,163 --> 01:02:03,428
- Why not?
- I'm not giving up on getting him back...

652
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:07,334
anymore than I've given up
getting on this ornery goat.

653
01:02:23,286 --> 01:02:25,220
Bye, Rio.

654
01:02:46,212 --> 01:02:49,545
- What's the matter?
- Boy, am I tuckered.

655
01:03:03,963 --> 01:03:08,297
- What are you lookin' for?
- A sink of tobacco.

656
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:11,132
Say, is there anything of mine
you don't cotton to?

657
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,672
- I guess I forgot.
- Yeah, it's a bad habit you got.

658
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,367
- What?
- Forgettin' what belongs to others.

659
01:03:15,441 --> 01:03:17,375
- You think I did it on purpose?
- Yes.

660
01:03:17,443 --> 01:03:20,901
- Listen, I don't feel good as it is.
- Neither do I.

661
01:03:22,248 --> 01:03:24,944
You wanna make something out of it?

662
01:03:25,018 --> 01:03:27,646
- That's a big advantage you're taking.
- I can't help it.

663
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,985
I'm so plumb beat out,
I'll be lucky if I can draw 'em clear.

664
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,787
I don't want to crowd
a sick man.

665
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:37,887
I'm all right. Just give me 40 winks
and I'll take ya with both hands free.

666
01:03:40,767 --> 01:03:44,168
I guess this is as good
a place as any to make camp.

667
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:46,000
There's no water.

668
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,165
And you won't find any
between here and Fort Sumner.

669
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,175
That's a long ways off.

670
01:03:51,945 --> 01:03:56,177
When we get there our friend,
the sheriff, won't be far behind.

671
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:57,910
Huh?

672
01:04:06,826 --> 01:04:08,418
Garrett?

673
01:04:10,697 --> 01:04:13,063
How do you know it's him?

674
01:04:13,132 --> 01:04:15,532
I can tell him farther off
than that.

675
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:18,036
He wouldn't be coming
after the two of us alone.

676
01:04:19,205 --> 01:04:21,969
Maybe he's lost too many
of his friends.

677
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:28,274
How come you didn't knock him over?
Or did you try?

678
01:04:28,348 --> 01:04:31,146
- Did I?
- That's what I said. Did ya?

679
01:04:33,353 --> 01:04:35,287
Didn't do nothin' else.

680
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:42,488
Who do you suppose
put him on our trail?

681
01:04:42,562 --> 01:04:45,292
Well, maybe somebody saw us
pulling out or...

682
01:04:45,365 --> 01:04:46,957
Or what?

683
01:04:48,368 --> 01:04:49,960
Nothing.

684
01:04:50,036 --> 01:04:54,132
- Sure, she was the one.
- Yeah, Rio.

685
01:04:54,207 --> 01:04:59,144
Why do you suppose she had to
up and do a thing like that?

686
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,707
Well, women are funny.

687
01:05:05,952 --> 01:05:09,888
Go easy on that water. We've only got
two canteens to get us to Fort Sumner.

688
01:05:12,725 --> 01:05:14,784
What's the matter?

689
01:05:14,861 --> 01:05:16,453
Look!

690
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:20,265
Sweet spirited miter.

691
01:05:21,434 --> 01:05:23,732
The little darling put sand in it
instead of water.

692
01:05:23,803 --> 01:05:26,601
That sure is one for the book.

693
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:30,734
Well, no use hanging 'round here
till morning. Let's get going.

694
01:06:06,412 --> 01:06:09,506
You know, Doc, I think
I'll have another drink.

695
01:06:09,582 --> 01:06:13,518
What are you talking about?
You didn't have one in the first place.

696
01:06:16,589 --> 01:06:19,422
No, but I had the same notion
about an hour ago.

697
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:24,094
I know what you're thinking,
but it won't do you any good.

698
01:06:24,163 --> 01:06:27,462
- Take my advice.
- What?

699
01:06:27,533 --> 01:06:29,467
Killing a woman.

700
01:06:32,605 --> 01:06:35,802
- Why not?
- They're all alike.

701
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:38,810
There isn't anything
they wouldn't do for you...

702
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,671
or to you.

703
01:06:57,530 --> 01:07:01,466
Hey, why didn't you wake me up?
We should've gotten started long ago.

704
01:07:03,302 --> 01:07:05,236
Keep 'em up!

705
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:08,637
Hello, Pat.

706
01:07:21,754 --> 01:07:24,689
- Where's Billy?
- Looks like he left ya.

707
01:07:26,893 --> 01:07:28,827
And on my horse, eh?

708
01:07:30,062 --> 01:07:31,393
Try those on.

709
01:07:33,099 --> 01:07:36,967
You know me.
Do I have to put these on?

710
01:07:37,036 --> 01:07:40,472
I know ya.
Put 'em on!

711
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:03,880
That was pretty smart,
putting sand in those canteens.

712
01:09:05,958 --> 01:09:08,791
I had to give you something
for your money, didn't I?

713
01:09:08,861 --> 01:09:10,988
Oh, I see.

714
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:14,362
So you sent the sheriff after us
for good measure, huh?

715
01:09:14,433 --> 01:09:16,424
No wonder he came alone.

716
01:09:16,502 --> 01:09:19,835
All he had to do was take his time
and wait for the sun to finish us off.

717
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,974
Then how did you get back?

718
01:09:24,777 --> 01:09:26,836
It was pretty tough...

719
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:30,314
but the more I thought about
seeing you, darling...

720
01:09:30,383 --> 01:09:32,351
the easier it got.

721
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:38,352
Then what are you waiting for?
Go ahead.

722
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:40,858
Say, that sounds real nice.

723
01:09:40,927 --> 01:09:44,294
I like to hear you ask for it.
Keep it up.

724
01:09:44,363 --> 01:09:46,297
Beg some more.

725
01:09:54,473 --> 01:09:56,964
What would you like me to say?

726
01:09:57,043 --> 01:10:00,843
Well, you might say "please"
very sweetly.

727
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:03,245
Please.

728
01:10:07,553 --> 01:10:09,214
Will you keep your eyes open?

729
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:11,449
Yes.

730
01:10:11,524 --> 01:10:14,391
Will you look right at me
while I do it?

731
01:10:55,601 --> 01:10:57,193
What is it?

732
01:10:57,269 --> 01:10:59,533
Everybody drinks but me.

733
01:10:59,605 --> 01:11:02,233
I'm supposed to be a camel, huh?

734
01:11:02,308 --> 01:11:05,709
You want a drink,
you can climb down and get it.

735
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:26,797
Say, did you hear something?

736
01:11:29,301 --> 01:11:32,293
- What kind of a track is that?
- I don't know.

737
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:35,306
Too small for a man.

738
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:37,976
Here's another one.

739
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:40,812
Couple over there.

740
01:11:52,358 --> 01:11:54,792
Well, take a look at that.

741
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:04,261
Yeah, it's an old Indian trick soaking
rawhide in water to make it shrink.

742
01:12:04,336 --> 01:12:06,770
Another hour, she'd have been hanging
by her wrists.

743
01:12:08,474 --> 01:12:10,669
Well, I'll say one thing for Billy.

744
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:13,337
He sure does pay off poetic.

745
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:16,006
He put her right where
she could see the water.

746
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:18,016
He just left here
less than half an hour ago.

747
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:20,018
He went that way,
toward those mountains.

748
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:23,021
- Are you all right? Sit.
- Don't worry about me. Go after him.

749
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:25,148
- We can't catch him now.
- Why not?

750
01:12:25,224 --> 01:12:28,125
He's got too much
of a head start on us. Sit down.

751
01:12:36,969 --> 01:12:39,199
You know, I think
he's in love with you.

752
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:41,034
What are you talking about?

753
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:45,703
The crazier a man is about a woman,
the crazier he thinks and does.

754
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:49,373
He's only crazy
about one thing: Himself.

755
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:52,884
Say, that gives me a thought.

756
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:54,943
Maybe we'll get Mr. Billy
after all.

757
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:57,614
- How?
- Just like he says.

758
01:12:57,690 --> 01:12:59,658
If he's crazy enough to do you
like this...

759
01:12:59,725 --> 01:13:02,592
maybe he's just crazy enough
to come back to turn you loose.

760
01:13:02,661 --> 01:13:04,754
You're the one that's crazy.

761
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:07,492
He doesn't care anything about me.
He'd never come back.

762
01:13:07,566 --> 01:13:12,162
Maybe so, but it's worth trying.
Ain't it, Doc?

763
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:15,435
If he's fool enough to come back,
he oughta get himself caught.

764
01:13:23,315 --> 01:13:26,478
I told you not to breathe so loud.

765
01:13:26,552 --> 01:13:28,645
All right, all right.

766
01:13:59,819 --> 01:14:02,253
Well, how do you like it?

767
01:14:04,824 --> 01:14:07,258
I thought I tied it tighter
than that.

768
01:14:14,667 --> 01:14:18,467
- You came back.
- Not on your account, I didn't.

769
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:21,734
- You didn't?
- You see Doc and the sheriff?

770
01:14:21,807 --> 01:14:24,640
Here we are, Billy,
right behind ya.

771
01:14:26,378 --> 01:14:28,642
Now put those hands
where they belong.

772
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:30,648
Say, why didn't you tip me off?

773
01:14:39,325 --> 01:14:43,591
Hurry up with that grub.
I wanna get to town before dark.

774
01:14:43,662 --> 01:14:46,859
- Well, I've only got two hands.
- Why don't you use both of 'em?

775
01:14:46,932 --> 01:14:50,459
- I'll use one on you in a minute.
- I wouldn't put it past ya.

776
01:14:50,536 --> 01:14:54,905
Now's your chance with me
all trussed up like a chicken.

777
01:14:56,108 --> 01:15:00,442
Here we are together again.
Same old happy family.

778
01:15:00,512 --> 01:15:03,675
Yeah, and I'd have been halfway to
Fort Sumner if it hadn't been for you.

779
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:06,149
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

780
01:15:06,218 --> 01:15:08,152
Give me a cigarette.

781
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:16,425
- You mean her.
- Rio! Are you out of your mind?

782
01:15:16,495 --> 01:15:21,398
- Come out and admit it like a man.
- Admit what?

783
01:15:21,467 --> 01:15:26,632
You didn't know Pat caught me until
you got back to our camp, did ya?

784
01:15:26,705 --> 01:15:29,833
- Then why come after us?
- Why not?

785
01:15:29,909 --> 01:15:33,970
We'd have been clear to Lincoln
before you even got back here.

786
01:15:34,046 --> 01:15:37,311
Say, mister, what are you
trying to make out?

787
01:15:37,383 --> 01:15:40,944
I heard you say once
you didn't like ranch cooking...

788
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:43,545
so I guess you figured you'd better
come back and get Rio.

789
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:45,783
You're daffy. I wouldn't come back
two inches to get her.

790
01:15:45,858 --> 01:15:47,758
- You did.
- I tell you I didn't.

791
01:15:47,826 --> 01:15:50,420
- Actions speak louder than words.
- Do they?

792
01:15:51,997 --> 01:15:54,557
I'll show you how much
I care about her.

793
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:59,161
If you want her back, you can have her.
Now what do you think about that?

794
01:16:02,274 --> 01:16:04,504
I don't want her.

795
01:16:04,576 --> 01:16:08,706
- Cattle don't graze after sheep.
- Sheep?

796
01:16:10,516 --> 01:16:11,949
Sheep did you say?

797
01:16:12,017 --> 01:16:14,952
I didn't say goats or monkeys.

798
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:17,079
Why you.

799
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:19,056
Ah, sit down.

800
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:32,869
- What's the matter with you?
- None of your business!

801
01:16:32,938 --> 01:16:35,270
Careful, young fella.

802
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:37,605
You want it now?

803
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:41,806
I've just been waitin'
for an excuse like this.

804
01:16:45,751 --> 01:16:47,878
I'll fix you up.

805
01:17:02,968 --> 01:17:08,133
Never mind fixin' any more food.
We're leavin' now. Come on.

806
01:17:08,207 --> 01:17:10,198
Let me get a drink first.

807
01:17:10,275 --> 01:17:12,209
All right, hurry up.

808
01:17:19,651 --> 01:17:23,109
Hey, Rio, come here and hold my hands
so I won't fall in.

809
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:40,504
Come out of there!

810
01:18:17,242 --> 01:18:19,506
You're all right now.
Come on.

811
01:18:28,887 --> 01:18:31,583
You figure on taking us back
to Lincoln, ain't ya?

812
01:18:31,657 --> 01:18:33,784
Where did ya think
I was takin' ya?

813
01:18:33,859 --> 01:18:38,626
- It's over that way, ain't it?
- Sure. What are you gettin' at?

814
01:18:38,697 --> 01:18:41,029
Take a look.

815
01:18:51,076 --> 01:18:53,010
Hey, Doc.

816
01:19:00,619 --> 01:19:03,417
Well, the Mescaleros
are out early this year.

817
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:05,787
They're talkin' about us,
ain't they?

818
01:19:05,858 --> 01:19:10,921
Yeah. They're tippin' off
another hunting party that must be out.

819
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:13,055
Right over there.

820
01:19:20,939 --> 01:19:22,873
On both sides of us.

821
01:19:25,477 --> 01:19:28,207
I guess our best chance
is to hightail it to Fort Sumner.

822
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:30,339
Don't figure on me
doing much hightailing.

823
01:19:30,415 --> 01:19:32,713
- Why not?
- I ain't no acrobat.

824
01:19:36,388 --> 01:19:38,618
I hope you fellas have sense enough
to behave yourselves.

825
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:41,215
Sure, Pat, certainly.

826
01:19:41,293 --> 01:19:43,227
Sure, Pat.

827
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:04,175
No, ya don't!

828
01:20:04,249 --> 01:20:06,479
- That's your horse over there.
- Who says so?

829
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:10,352
I say so.
Get on him and hurry up.

830
01:20:10,422 --> 01:20:12,356
Rio, you ride the paint.

831
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:19,890
Thanks.

832
01:20:23,335 --> 01:20:25,929
Hey, Red's my horse.

833
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:30,101
I know he is,
but I'm gonna ride him.

834
01:21:30,235 --> 01:21:32,635
I don't like this.

835
01:21:32,704 --> 01:21:35,332
Looks like some of those Mescaleros
are ahead of us too.

836
01:21:35,407 --> 01:21:38,399
No, you better not
come over here, Rio.

837
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:41,344
- Why not?
- They put the fire on them.

838
01:21:41,413 --> 01:21:43,973
Those Mescaleros sure do play
for keeps.

839
01:21:44,049 --> 01:21:46,643
Say, what's that?

840
01:21:56,662 --> 01:22:00,029
It's a good size party. We'll be
knee-deep in them in a minute.

841
01:22:00,098 --> 01:22:01,759
Look over there too.

842
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:15,776
- Hey, what are ya doin'?
- What do ya think? I want my gun.

843
01:22:15,847 --> 01:22:17,439
Now wait a minute.

844
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:21,282
You're not gonna argue at a time like
this. Aren't you gonna give us a chance?

845
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:24,186
He'd like to see them
put the fire on me.

846
01:22:24,256 --> 01:22:26,190
- I sure would.
- What about her?

847
01:22:27,759 --> 01:22:30,557
We can't talk about it now.
I want to know one thing.

848
01:22:30,629 --> 01:22:33,120
Do I have your solemn promise
that you'll give them back when I ask?

849
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:35,632
- Sure. What do you think we are?
- Will you see to it that he does?

850
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:37,828
Who's gonna see to it that I do?

851
01:22:37,903 --> 01:22:39,837
I'll take your word for it.

852
01:22:42,107 --> 01:22:44,132
- Where are my cartridges?
- Here you are.

853
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,803
Now what do we do?
Make a stand or run for it?

854
01:22:46,878 --> 01:22:48,846
- Can't make a stand here.
- I know something that might work.

855
01:22:48,914 --> 01:22:52,441
- What is it?
- Come on. Do exactly what I do.

856
01:25:32,410 --> 01:25:34,344
Cut him loose!

857
01:26:11,216 --> 01:26:14,947
I know this place. We're about
40 miles from Fort Sumner.

858
01:26:19,791 --> 01:26:21,986
Senor Garrett, what are you
doing out this late?

859
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:24,654
Hello, Pablo.
Can you put us up for the night?

860
01:26:24,729 --> 01:26:27,562
Sure, glad to have you. Come right in.
My house is yours.

861
01:26:27,632 --> 01:26:29,566
I'll take care of the horses.

862
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:48,378
Well, boys, I guess
we're out of the woods now, huh?

863
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:51,388
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

864
01:26:59,064 --> 01:27:02,329
I wouldn't be too sure
of that, Pat.

865
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:07,495
Oh, yes, he's right, Pat.

866
01:27:07,572 --> 01:27:09,733
Those Mescaleros
don't give up so easy.

867
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:45,101
This is very important.

868
01:27:45,176 --> 01:27:47,474
I want you to ride to Fort Sumner...

869
01:27:47,545 --> 01:27:50,173
and give this note
to the town marshal.

870
01:27:53,284 --> 01:27:55,650
Did he say "town marshal"?

871
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:58,154
That's what it sounded like to me.

872
01:28:54,913 --> 01:28:56,847
Thanks, Rio.

873
01:29:27,312 --> 01:29:29,906
It certainly is
a beautiful night out.

874
01:29:32,117 --> 01:29:35,314
I think I'll take
a little stroll.

875
01:29:35,386 --> 01:29:40,221
And, gentlemen, just in case
I shouldn't return before you retire...

876
01:29:40,291 --> 01:29:43,021
I'll say good night now.

877
01:29:43,094 --> 01:29:45,790
I think I'll go with ya.

878
01:29:47,732 --> 01:29:53,068
Well, Billy, you've been pretty good
to my little horse.

879
01:29:53,138 --> 01:29:56,733
I guess the least I can do
is let you say good-bye to him.

880
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:59,174
That's awfully nice of you, Doc.

881
01:29:59,244 --> 01:30:02,680
Oh, I always like to think
of the other fella.

882
01:30:02,747 --> 01:30:05,238
So if you just stand right here
in this doorway...

883
01:30:05,316 --> 01:30:08,149
and don't make no warlike moves...

884
01:30:08,219 --> 01:30:12,178
then you can wave farewell to 'im
as we ride off.

885
01:30:12,257 --> 01:30:14,885
In other words,
you think you're gonna leave.

886
01:30:14,959 --> 01:30:20,397
I'm sorry, Pat, I hate to eat and run,
but you know how it is.

887
01:30:22,367 --> 01:30:25,666
- Listen, Doc.
- You're wasting your time, Pat.

888
01:30:25,737 --> 01:30:27,671
Haven't you forgotten something?

889
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:32,871
No, I don't think so.
Good night all.

890
01:30:34,412 --> 01:30:36,346
Say, Doc.

891
01:30:37,882 --> 01:30:39,474
Yes, what is it?

892
01:30:39,551 --> 01:30:43,043
I'm afraid you'll have to listen
to me for a minute.

893
01:30:44,222 --> 01:30:46,156
Why?

894
01:30:51,196 --> 01:30:54,222
What if I don't feel
like waving good-bye to Red?

895
01:30:56,401 --> 01:30:59,461
You still think you got something
to say about that horse, eh?

896
01:30:59,537 --> 01:31:01,596
Yes, I do.

897
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:07,106
All right, go ahead and say it.

898
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:12,711
That's a pretty big advantage
to give a man like you.

899
01:31:12,784 --> 01:31:14,718
Didn't you tell me that once?

900
01:31:24,762 --> 01:31:26,161
How's this?

901
01:31:26,231 --> 01:31:29,132
You don't have to go that far.

902
01:31:30,535 --> 01:31:32,662
Thanks.

903
01:31:32,737 --> 01:31:36,332
What about him?
Will he leave us alone?

904
01:31:36,407 --> 01:31:40,241
Or do you think we ought to
pull his teeth before we start?

905
01:31:40,311 --> 01:31:42,575
Don't worry about me.

906
01:31:42,647 --> 01:31:47,016
I wouldn't lift a finger, Doc,
to keep you from killing him.

907
01:31:47,085 --> 01:31:50,384
You and me never had any trouble
till he came along.

908
01:31:52,023 --> 01:31:54,048
He'll keep out of it.

909
01:31:54,125 --> 01:31:56,992
All right, son, I'm waiting.

910
01:31:57,061 --> 01:32:00,462
Put those plates down.
You're makin' me nervous.

911
01:32:01,799 --> 01:32:04,632
- Billy, he'll kill ya.
- What do you care?

912
01:32:04,702 --> 01:32:06,693
- But you can get another horse.
- I want this one.

913
01:32:06,771 --> 01:32:08,363
Why?

914
01:32:08,439 --> 01:32:11,101
I wanna see if I can teach him
to make smoke come out of his ears.

915
01:32:11,175 --> 01:32:13,166
Say, I haven't got all night.

916
01:32:13,244 --> 01:32:15,712
Get back against that wall.

917
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,714
- But Billy...
- Go on!

918
01:32:18,983 --> 01:32:21,008
And count up to three.

919
01:32:21,085 --> 01:32:23,781
I won't. You're outta your mind,
both of ya.

920
01:32:23,855 --> 01:32:26,221
How about you, Pat?

921
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:30,625
Sure, I'll be glad to.

922
01:32:30,695 --> 01:32:34,654
You're too willing.
I don't trust you.

923
01:32:43,942 --> 01:32:46,934
I think I'd rather have that
cuckoo clock do the counting for me.

924
01:32:49,314 --> 01:32:52,909
Yeah, that's good enough.
It's gonna strike in a minute.

925
01:32:52,984 --> 01:32:55,544
Should we pull on the last cuckoo?

926
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:57,383
All right.

927
01:33:03,861 --> 01:33:07,126
Well, Billy, I guess this is it.

928
01:33:07,198 --> 01:33:10,361
Men are pretty much like children
after all.

929
01:33:11,636 --> 01:33:14,935
Have you ever seen two kids
wrestling in the yard?

930
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:17,975
They push and tussle and maybe
they look like they're fighting...

931
01:33:18,042 --> 01:33:19,509
but they're not.

932
01:33:20,511 --> 01:33:22,877
They're really friends...

933
01:33:22,947 --> 01:33:25,575
and everything's in fun.

934
01:33:25,650 --> 01:33:28,744
Then pretty soon,
they play a little too rough...

935
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:30,253
one of 'em gets mad...

936
01:33:30,321 --> 01:33:35,122
and in the end,
somebody always gets hurt.

937
01:33:35,193 --> 01:33:39,789
So for you and me,
this is where somebody gets hurt.

938
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:41,991
But when it's over...

939
01:33:42,066 --> 01:33:44,899
and however it turns out, son...

940
01:33:44,969 --> 01:33:47,665
no hard feelings.

941
01:34:22,173 --> 01:34:24,107
Why didn't you draw?

942
01:34:26,444 --> 01:34:29,311
Why did you change your mind?
This some trick of yours?

943
01:34:31,349 --> 01:34:35,843
No, I just don't feel like it.
Maybe I ate too much.

944
01:34:38,289 --> 01:34:41,315
Perhaps some other night
you will feel like it, eh?

945
01:34:41,392 --> 01:34:44,088
Who knows?

946
01:34:44,162 --> 01:34:46,858
I never wanted it, but I've waited
and let you pick...

947
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:49,422
your own time and place.

948
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:51,730
You've done that tonight.

949
01:34:51,803 --> 01:34:54,397
You gonna draw,
or do I have to make you?

950
01:35:09,087 --> 01:35:11,453
Are you gonna fight...

951
01:35:11,522 --> 01:35:13,956
or do you want me
to nick your ears?

952
01:35:21,499 --> 01:35:23,967
Doc, have you gone loco?

953
01:35:38,316 --> 01:35:41,183
What's the matter with you, Billy?

954
01:35:41,252 --> 01:35:43,413
I didn't think you'd take this
off anybody.

955
01:35:43,488 --> 01:35:45,922
Maybe I wouldn't,
off anybody else.

956
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:48,220
What do you mean by that?

957
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:53,988
Doc, don't listen to that kind of talk.
Haven't you ever seen cold feet before?

958
01:35:54,065 --> 01:35:58,729
He never had cold feet in his life.
What is it, Billy?

959
01:35:58,803 --> 01:36:02,398
I guess the idea about the cuckoo clock
wasn't so good.

960
01:36:02,473 --> 01:36:04,737
Why?

961
01:36:04,809 --> 01:36:08,745
Well, it gave me time to think
and remember a few things.

962
01:36:09,814 --> 01:36:11,839
You're the only partner
I ever had.

963
01:36:15,586 --> 01:36:18,111
Gosh, do you really feel
that way, son?

964
01:36:21,292 --> 01:36:24,750
- I treated you worse than anyone.
- Nah, it was all my fault.

965
01:36:24,829 --> 01:36:28,856
- Wouldn't want Red carrying both of us.
- Oh, don't worry.

966
01:36:28,933 --> 01:36:31,629
We can find a better way than that
to divide 'im up.

967
01:36:31,702 --> 01:36:33,693
Say, you can ride 'im outta here.

968
01:36:33,771 --> 01:36:36,365
No, I had him last.

969
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:38,738
That's right, come to think of it.

970
01:37:22,153 --> 01:37:25,611
I ain't worried about you and me
ever fighting now, Billy...

971
01:37:25,690 --> 01:37:27,624
because one thing is certain.

972
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:32,621
If we didn't do it tonight,
we never will.

973
01:37:32,697 --> 01:37:34,631
Come on. Let's go.

974
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:42,963
So long, Pat.
Don't take any wooden nickels.

975
01:37:50,014 --> 01:37:51,948
You're not going with him.

976
01:37:52,016 --> 01:37:55,281
Look here, you ain't gonna start
something with the two of us, are ya?

977
01:37:57,588 --> 01:38:00,785
I might've known you'd do this to me.

978
01:38:00,858 --> 01:38:04,316
Ever since you met him,
you've treated me like a dog.

979
01:38:04,395 --> 01:38:07,296
The very first day,
you sided with him against me...

980
01:38:07,365 --> 01:38:09,925
and made me the laughingstock
of the town!

981
01:38:10,001 --> 01:38:12,265
Take it easy.

982
01:38:12,336 --> 01:38:17,000
I gave you your guns
so you'd have a chance for your life.

983
01:38:17,074 --> 01:38:20,510
And now you tell me I gotta fight
the two of you to get them back.

984
01:38:21,812 --> 01:38:24,576
You stand there, side by side...

985
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:28,176
with that little snip of a kid
against me...

986
01:38:28,252 --> 01:38:33,212
me, the oldest and best friend
you ever had!

987
01:38:33,291 --> 01:38:37,694
And I still would be
if it wasn't for him!

988
01:38:39,196 --> 01:38:42,097
Say, mister, that's about enough
outta you for one night.

989
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:44,600
Wait a minute.
You let me handle this.

990
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:46,603
Pat is a friend of mine.

991
01:38:46,671 --> 01:38:50,732
I don't want to kill him, and
I don't want you to kill him. Clear?

992
01:38:56,681 --> 01:38:59,980
Pat, you're just getting yourself
all steamed up.

993
01:39:00,051 --> 01:39:03,214
I'll be seeing you one of these days,
and we'll have a good laugh about this.

994
01:39:03,287 --> 01:39:04,777
Now, so long.

995
01:39:10,628 --> 01:39:13,392
Be careful. You know you haven't got
a chance against me.

996
01:39:26,544 --> 01:39:28,478
Good-bye.

997
01:39:40,591 --> 01:39:44,425
- Say.
- No, son, please, don't do that.

998
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:56,172
Oh, Doc, lie down.

999
01:39:58,476 --> 01:40:00,410
Why not?

1000
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:03,874
That's one thing
I've always been afraid of.

1001
01:40:03,948 --> 01:40:07,281
- What?
- Dying in bed.

1002
01:40:13,724 --> 01:40:15,919
Why didn't you shoot?

1003
01:40:15,993 --> 01:40:19,827
You had me beat by a mile.
You had me cold.

1004
01:40:23,634 --> 01:40:26,398
Maybe I don't like cold meat.

1005
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:51,594
Well, go ahead.

1006
01:40:53,230 --> 01:40:55,164
Go ahead, what?

1007
01:40:55,232 --> 01:40:57,996
Aren't you going to say
something over Doc?

1008
01:41:00,070 --> 01:41:02,595
I don't know what to say.

1009
01:41:02,673 --> 01:41:05,574
I never said anything over anybody
I killed before.

1010
01:41:07,178 --> 01:41:09,703
I think we oughta say something
over Doc.

1011
01:41:11,248 --> 01:41:13,239
You better do it.

1012
01:41:21,892 --> 01:41:23,826
So long, Doc.

1013
01:41:35,573 --> 01:41:37,632
I want you to know I'm sorry.

1014
01:41:40,177 --> 01:41:42,111
I honestly am.

1015
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:45,705
Last night I was ready
to kill you...

1016
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:49,945
but in the daylight,
I can see things much better.

1017
01:41:51,455 --> 01:41:54,618
You and Doc have been friends
for years.

1018
01:41:54,692 --> 01:41:59,994
If I hadn't come between ya,
none of this would've happened.

1019
01:42:02,633 --> 01:42:05,568
It sure is funny...

1020
01:42:05,636 --> 01:42:08,901
how two or three trails can cross...

1021
01:42:08,973 --> 01:42:12,067
and get all tangled up.

1022
01:42:14,178 --> 01:42:16,112
Well, go ahead.

1023
01:42:22,653 --> 01:42:24,587
After you.

1024
01:42:24,655 --> 01:42:28,421
Say, you don't think I'd shoot you
in the back, do you?

1025
01:42:28,492 --> 01:42:32,155
I don't know,
but I ain't gonna tempt ya.

1026
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:36,029
I don't think you'd be fool enough
to try to do it from the front.

1027
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:39,035
You never trust anybody, do you?

1028
01:42:41,372 --> 01:42:43,306
I apologize, Pat.

1029
01:42:44,375 --> 01:42:46,309
Go ahead.

1030
01:43:06,530 --> 01:43:08,464
Who's that?

1031
01:43:12,336 --> 01:43:15,305
- Where's Pat?
- He's still in the house.

1032
01:43:15,372 --> 01:43:18,967
- What's he doin'?
- He's not gonna try to stop you.

1033
01:43:19,043 --> 01:43:21,477
- How do you know?
- He told me so.

1034
01:43:36,026 --> 01:43:39,826
Say, Billy,
can I see you for a minute?

1035
01:43:41,565 --> 01:43:43,590
What do you want?

1036
01:43:44,935 --> 01:43:48,496
If that's the way ya feel about it,
never mind.

1037
01:43:52,509 --> 01:43:56,001
At least I'm not afraid
to turn my back on you.

1038
01:44:02,586 --> 01:44:04,520
Here. Hold these a minute.

1039
01:44:56,707 --> 01:45:00,268
I thought you might like
to have Doc's guns as a keepsake.

1040
01:45:07,251 --> 01:45:09,913
Say, I sure would.

1041
01:45:09,987 --> 01:45:13,218
Thanks, Pat.
Thanks a whole lot.

1042
01:45:13,290 --> 01:45:15,758
I never had an extra pair.

1043
01:45:15,826 --> 01:45:17,760
Black holsters too.

1044
01:45:19,096 --> 01:45:22,429
They'd go nice with Sunday clothes,
if I ever get any.

1045
01:45:26,036 --> 01:45:28,231
Do you think they'll suit ya?

1046
01:45:28,305 --> 01:45:30,796
If the barrels ain't too long.

1047
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:38,773
No, they're just the same.

1048
01:45:45,022 --> 01:45:47,786
Be careful. They're loaded.

1049
01:45:51,628 --> 01:45:53,562
That's right.

1050
01:46:06,710 --> 01:46:09,372
I think they're
better balanced than mine.

1051
01:46:11,281 --> 01:46:13,841
Then how about letting me
have yours?

1052
01:46:15,452 --> 01:46:18,148
My guns? What for?

1053
01:46:25,229 --> 01:46:27,561
If I had your guns...

1054
01:46:27,631 --> 01:46:31,397
I could say it was you out there
in that grave, instead of Doc.

1055
01:46:33,737 --> 01:46:35,967
You'd pass Doc off as me?

1056
01:46:36,039 --> 01:46:37,973
Sure.

1057
01:46:39,476 --> 01:46:43,503
Everybody would believe me
once they saw your six-shooters.

1058
01:46:44,581 --> 01:46:47,414
You could leave an end
to your trail right here.

1059
01:46:47,484 --> 01:46:49,748
Nobody'd follow you up north.

1060
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:51,913
All your troubles
would be buried...

1061
01:46:51,989 --> 01:46:54,048
past and present.

1062
01:46:54,124 --> 01:46:57,582
You and Rio could go off
with nothing to worry about.

1063
01:47:04,935 --> 01:47:07,426
How come you'd do a favor
like that for me?

1064
01:47:09,006 --> 01:47:11,770
There you go again, Billy.

1065
01:47:11,842 --> 01:47:15,369
Distrustin' a person
who's tryin' to be decent to you.

1066
01:47:20,117 --> 01:47:24,053
Don't you realize
that's your whole trouble?

1067
01:47:24,121 --> 01:47:28,080
Don't you see that's what's gotten you
into all your fights?

1068
01:47:28,158 --> 01:47:33,095
You got more enemies than anybody
in this part of the country.

1069
01:47:33,163 --> 01:47:36,132
How do you expect to get along
with people...

1070
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:38,828
when you think every man who holds
his hand out to you...

1071
01:47:38,902 --> 01:47:41,735
has a knife behind his back?

1072
01:47:41,805 --> 01:47:44,365
Son, l...

1073
01:47:44,441 --> 01:47:48,343
I just don't know what's going
to become of you.

1074
01:47:48,412 --> 01:47:50,073
Honest, I don't.

1075
01:47:52,850 --> 01:47:55,648
I didn't mean anything.
I'm sorry.

1076
01:47:57,688 --> 01:48:00,122
That's the spirit.

1077
01:48:00,190 --> 01:48:02,124
That's my boy.

1078
01:48:02,192 --> 01:48:05,389
Now give me those guns and clear out
of here, before it's too late.

1079
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:18,608
What's the matter?

1080
01:48:18,675 --> 01:48:21,269
Nothing.

1081
01:48:21,345 --> 01:48:24,940
But I've had these guns
a long time.

1082
01:48:25,015 --> 01:48:27,347
I sure hate to let go of 'em.

1083
01:48:29,286 --> 01:48:32,119
I've been pretty patient with you.

1084
01:48:35,359 --> 01:48:37,725
Billy, my son...

1085
01:48:37,794 --> 01:48:39,921
it's your duty to give them up.

1086
01:48:39,997 --> 01:48:42,192
You owe it to yourself.

1087
01:48:42,266 --> 01:48:44,598
You ought to start a new life today.

1088
01:48:44,668 --> 01:48:47,193
Those guns are the badge
of your shame.

1089
01:48:47,271 --> 01:48:49,603
They represent everything
you must leave behind you.

1090
01:48:49,673 --> 01:48:52,699
Don't you realize that?
Don't you understand...

1091
01:48:52,776 --> 01:48:55,574
that if you're going to start
all over again...

1092
01:48:55,646 --> 01:48:59,275
your hands must be clean?

1093
01:49:03,887 --> 01:49:07,084
I guess you're right, Pat.

1094
01:49:07,157 --> 01:49:09,887
I never thought of it like that.

1095
01:49:18,235 --> 01:49:19,998
Thanks, Pat.

1096
01:49:20,070 --> 01:49:25,007
Billy, you don't know
what this means to me.

1097
01:49:27,244 --> 01:49:29,508
You'll never forget this day.

1098
01:49:48,332 --> 01:49:50,266
Good-bye, Pat.

1099
01:49:51,368 --> 01:49:53,302
Why do you say that?

1100
01:49:53,370 --> 01:49:55,838
Why shouldn't I?

1101
01:49:55,906 --> 01:49:58,966
Why should you?
You ain't goin' anywhere.

1102
01:50:01,178 --> 01:50:04,739
I took the firing pins
out of those guns.

1103
01:50:18,562 --> 01:50:19,995
Why you...

1104
01:50:22,466 --> 01:50:27,199
Nothing would make me happier
than for you to keep coming.

1105
01:50:57,501 --> 01:50:59,594
Is that one of your own guns?

1106
01:51:01,471 --> 01:51:02,563
It sure looks like it.

1107
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:05,574
How did you get it?

1108
01:51:07,144 --> 01:51:10,341
You dirty little cheat.

1109
01:51:10,414 --> 01:51:12,678
You switched those guns on me.

1110
01:51:12,749 --> 01:51:15,513
Of all the dirty, rotten tricks...

1111
01:51:15,585 --> 01:51:18,452
I didn't mean to, Pat.

1112
01:51:18,522 --> 01:51:20,888
Honest, I didn't.

1113
01:51:20,957 --> 01:51:23,357
They must've gotten mixed up
while I was playin' with 'em.

1114
01:51:44,548 --> 01:51:46,482
Thanks.

1115
01:51:50,821 --> 01:51:53,688
I left my guns right there.

1116
01:51:57,394 --> 01:51:59,555
What for?

1117
01:52:00,797 --> 01:52:05,166
Don't you have to show them to everybody
to make them believe your story?

1118
01:52:06,236 --> 01:52:08,670
You see, I have an idea...

1119
01:52:08,738 --> 01:52:13,107
that you'd rather give Doc the credit
for doing you up like this.

1120
01:52:13,176 --> 01:52:15,269
Because I think you'd rather be dead
than have people know...

1121
01:52:15,345 --> 01:52:17,939
that Billy the Kid did this to ya.

1122
01:52:21,852 --> 01:52:23,479
Good-bye, Pat.

1123
01:52:34,865 --> 01:52:37,527
You don't wanna go off
without your canteens, do you?

1124
01:52:37,601 --> 01:52:39,535
- Did you fill 'em up for me?
- Yes.
