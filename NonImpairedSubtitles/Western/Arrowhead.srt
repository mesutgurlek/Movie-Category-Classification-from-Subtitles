1
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,920
{y:i}Oh, she stood right there
{y:i}In the moonlight bare...

2
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,880
Off.

3
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,480
- What, here?
- Maybe.

4
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,880
A two-week scout and no signs.
Now 15 miles from the fort,

5
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,000
that inner sense of yours
has gotta act up.

6
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,680
Another stretch of sand.

7
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,480
Wore it out cleaning up their tracks.

8
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,640
Cut a lot of fresh branches.

9
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,640
Took a lot of rubbing.

10
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,920
The main party headed toward
the fort.

11
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,920
What are Apaches going into
the fort for? Trade for trinkets?

12
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,640
A couple of them
headed up that way.

13
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,080
Maybe to the other side of the hill.

14
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,520
I'm going up.

15
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,680
- Let's go.
- Not you.

16
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,120
I wanna be sure
where the main bunch is.

17
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,040
You just go along easy.

18
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,840
Are you talking as plain Ed Bannon,

19
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,040
or you talking as Mr. Bannon,
Chief of Scouts?

20
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,800
I'm all through talking, Sandy.
Just go along easy.

21
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,480
Turn around, dirt.

22
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,320
Bannon!

23
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,520
If I always obeyed the Chief of Scouts,
the Chief of Scouts wouldn't live long.

24
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,760
Halt.

25
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,760
What went wrong?

26
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,960
- Ed Bannon's up there, sir.
- That's what went wrong, sir.

27
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,320
And Sandy Mackinnon.
Both all right.

28
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,720
Take a detail, Captain North.
We're going up.

29
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,360
- Sergeant Stone.
- Yes, sir.

30
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,360
First two set of twos. Lead up.

31
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,480
Lead up.

32
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,040
Noses up.

33
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,560
- Hi, Ed.
- Hi, Bill.

34
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,680
- Jim Eagle. What tribe were they?
- Tontos. Azuni's band.

35
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,440
I asked what tribe they were.

36
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,520
Bannon's never wrong about Apaches,
except this Apache.

37
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,080
They're Tontos, sir.
Chief Azuni's men.

38
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,320
This is one time I wish you
were a soldier, Bannon,

39
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,720
so I could have you drummed out of
the Army for what you've just done.

40
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,760
I'd be interested to know what
I've just done, colonel.

41
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,440
Orders from Washington, try
a peaceful approach with the Apaches.

42
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,640
Would you mind clearing that up
for me, colonel? I'm a little...

43
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,120
I'm a little backward.

44
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,920
Today Chief Azuni was to bring
his people into the post.

45
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,600
These men Bannon murdered
were to lead me to him.

46
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,840
Colonel, these are Apaches
you're dealing with.

47
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,120
You're no longer telling us
how to deal with Apaches.

48
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,160
In civilian talk, you're fired.

49
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,920
I just resigned.

50
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,920
He just resigned. Which way
you going back to the post?

51
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,400
The way every detail goes back.

52
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,040
Pick another way, colonel.

53
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,840
These Apaches were here for peace.
Do you see any paint on their faces?

54
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,080
They don't have to have it on their
faces, but they can't fight without paint.

55
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,520
They gotta have it on them
somewhere.

56
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,000
Isn't that right, Jim Eagle?

57
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,720
It is not for me to say.
I am no longer a savage.

58
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,560
Yeah.

59
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,080
See what I mean?

60
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,440
Same here.

61
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,120
Jim Eagle, any truth in that?

62
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,520
No truth, sir.

63
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,440
- No truth in you either, Apache.
- That's enough, Bannon.

64
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,400
Without your help, we'll try again
with Azuni and his Tontos,

65
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,160
and we'll succeed.

66
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,200
Pick another way back to the post
anyway, colonel.

67
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,040
We're at peace.

68
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,760
It's a good way to stay alive
while you're at peace.

69
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,160
Advice from the white Apache.

70
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,520
Sir, request permission
for burial detail.

71
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,960
Permission granted.

72
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,040
Sergeant Stone, pick and shovel.

73
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,200
Ives, get that packhorse up here.

74
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,200
Burial detail, forward.

75
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,160
Lead out.

76
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,520
I'll get our horses,
Chief Ex-of-Scouts.

77
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,280
Those Tontos were decoys.

78
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,640
That's adobe country the colonel's
riding through,

79
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,520
sometimes three, four ravines
to the mile.

80
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,920
A ravine's got two walls.

81
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,360
From behind any wall, any time,
the Tontos can spring

82
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,440
the prettiest ambush you ever saw.

83
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,160
And they get to pick the wall.

84
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,840
Azuni gave his word he'd come in
peacefully today.

85
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,680
You're as blind as the colonel, if that's
possible. And it's possible.

86
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,440
Don't say that to me, Ed.
I'm Army, I like it.

87
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,280
Yeah? You were probably pretty good
at Gettysburg.

88
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,440
But this isn't Gettysburg.

89
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,280
What do you know about Gettysburg?
You've never been east of the Pecos.

90
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,840
If you had, you wouldn't wear
those Rebel pants.

91
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,160
- Sure I would. I like gray.
- You like being ornery.

92
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You keep on hating Apaches, we're
gonna be digging one of those for you.

93
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,600
I don't hate them, I know them.

94
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,240
What you did stopped the Tonto tribe
from coming in.

95
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,200
Which it never was.

96
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,880
What's worse, the Chiricahuas
might not come in tomorrow.

97
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,680
Chiricahuas. There's no white man
on earth could get them to come in.

98
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,120
Tomorrow.

99
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,760
Toriano's Back East.

100
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,080
He's coming to the post tomorrow
from the Indian school.

101
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,720
How do you suppose we could get
the rest of the Apaches to come in

102
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,480
if we couldn't guarantee them
Toriano's people would come?

103
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,320
And he just happens to get back
from the East the same day?

104
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,960
Coincidence. It happens.
Use your common sense.

105
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,440
For four years, I was the adopted son
of an Apache medicine man.

106
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,360
They got their own kind
of common sense.

107
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,800
Toriano's people are coming in

108
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,200
because his father asked
the Army for help.

109
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,120
- Chattez?
- Good man.

110
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,240
Maybe he is. So tomorrow
he brings in his Chiricahuas,

111
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,880
the most vicious Indian on earth,
to be shipped off to a reservation

112
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,480
the same day his son gets back
from school?

113
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,400
You call that a coincidence?

114
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,400
You know so much about Apaches.
What's the answer?

115
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,720
I haven't got hold of it yet,
but there is one.

116
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,120
Well, in the meantime...

117
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,200
Jordan, Cassidy, Ives.

118
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,720
- Yes, sir?
- Finish up.

119
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,720
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

120
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,480
The quickest way is straight across
that river.

121
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,080
That's not the way
the detail went back.

122
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,200
Won't do any good to tell you
it's the safest.

123
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,240
So I'll repeat, it's the quickest way
to catch up with the colonel.

124
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,840
- Forward.
- Lead out.

125
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,680
- Up there!
- Look in the hills! Chiricahuas!

126
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,320
Stone, get going on foot.

127
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,000
Behind the rocks.

128
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,320
Get back. Continue firing!

129
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,840
The closer we get, the more we get.
Come on. On the hill! Fire!

130
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,000
We could've got a lot more
if you'd let us get closer.

131
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,760
They could've got a lot more too.

132
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,320
If you want to give orders,
join the Army.

133
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,000
We can still mount up
some kind of a detail, sir.

134
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,480
What else could we expect?

135
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,720
The Apaches played fair,
sent out their go-betweens,

136
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,160
and Bannon murdered them.

137
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,680
- Get rid of him. That's an order.
- Yes, sir.

138
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,920
Get rid of...

139
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,800
I'll get rid of him right now.

140
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,800
Stone.

141
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,440
All right, let's get started.

142
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,880
Take the dead back to the post
for burial.

143
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,080
Halt.

144
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,840
What happened?

145
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,480
All because Bannon hates Apaches.

146
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,000
This many dead would've been alive.

147
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,640
- Dismiss the company, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

148
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,240
Twos left!

149
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,480
Why didn't you tell them those Apaches
weren't coming into the fort?

150
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,640
- They were waiting for us.
- Tell them.

151
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,440
Who we gonna convince?

152
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,920
Come on up and have a drink.

153
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,080
Bannon is back. Nita's glad.
Nita bring you laundry.

154
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,840
Now, what more does a man
like you want?

155
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,760
Nita?

156
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,000
I don't understand you.
You say you hate Apaches.

157
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,400
She might be half-Mexican,
but the other half's Apache.

158
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,000
Well, among other things,
she's the post laundress.

159
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,520
Washes my clothes awful good.

160
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,200
- She's still half-Apache, remember?
- I always remember.

161
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,440
Going to see Lee?

162
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,000
Why? Did she say
she'd marry you yet?

163
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,160
Practically said.

164
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,360
- You let me know when she does.
- Leave her alone.

165
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,480
Look, Bill, with the colonel dead,
you're top man around here.

166
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,440
But I've just been fired, remember?
Don't try to give me orders.

167
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,080
Are you gonna make me stand here,
or do I get myself a drink?

168
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,480
Please go, Ed.

169
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,440
I'll say again,

170
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,160
your husband had the finest taste in
whiskey a captain's salary could buy.

171
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,800
Just have your drink.

172
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,520
Am I wrong, or wasn't there a time
when you said it'd be just us?

173
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,520
Was I wrong for not knowing
what you were?

174
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,800
All I've gotta do is be around you
and everything I think

175
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,280
comes out wrong when I say it.

176
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,400
Even when I want it to be good,
it comes out wrong.

177
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,040
Because you're one thing and I'm
another. Can't you remember?

178
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,200
Ed, please stop bringing back
what we started out to be.

179
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,400
We're what we are now.
And you're not unhappy.

180
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,880
I watched you ride in.
I saw your laundress speak to you.

181
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,280
- What's the matter with Nita?
- Nothing.

182
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,640
She's a good laundress.
You never make any offers.

183
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,360
Glasses are over there.

184
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,040
They are if you're drinking tea.

185
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,880
I'm not drinking tea.

186
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,800
The tumblers are still where
they used to be.

187
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,600
Captain Frank Wilson,

188
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,360
dearly beloved of Lela Clark Wilson.

189
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,400
Ed, please go.

190
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,160
Yeah, I'll go.

191
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,720
I'll go like I've had to go ever since
you married a man

192
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,800
who fought the Apaches like he fought
the Virginians outside of Richmond.

193
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,200
You still can't stand me close to you.

194
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,640
Ed, please don't.

195
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,200
Will you listen to me?
Will you come out here?

196
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,240
Well, we're out here.

197
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,240
I watched the column come in.

198
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,400
A lot of casualties. Very unusual
for a colonel to be among them.

199
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,280
I heard the sergeant
blame the deaths on you.

200
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,680
You've got good hearing.

201
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,080
Is it true? Did you murder
the go-betweens

202
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,000
just when the Apaches were ready
to come in in peace?

203
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,400
That's what they say.

204
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,400
Ever since I've known you,
you've been a murderer.

205
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,120
Your husband was killed
because he wasn't a murderer.

206
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,520
He trusted the Apaches,
went out to make peace with them.

207
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,400
Your father was killed by them too,

208
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,680
but you were too young
to remember your father.

209
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,680
I can't hate all Apaches for what
some of them might have done to me.

210
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,800
But you can.

211
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,560
Maybe it gives you an excuse
to murder every chance you get.

212
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,560
Because you lived with them,

213
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,920
and you're ashamed to be thought of
as one of them.

214
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,760
The Apaches have a saying:

215
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,000
Think what you want to think.
You have to live with your thoughts.

216
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,160
When you've killed
till you can't kill any longer,

217
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,480
what do we do then?

218
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,040
Run away and live in peace?

219
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,160
Lee, I think we ought to call on
the colonel's wife.

220
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,480
When she gets over the shock,
she'll kind of be at a loss.

221
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,240
I'll get my things.

222
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,560
You were right.
She'll stick to the Army.

223
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,840
All right, that's enough.

224
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,400
You've had enough water to drink,
you hammer-headed goat.

225
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,000
Settle down! Whoa!

226
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,040
Easy. Whoa. Whoa, easy, easy.

227
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,680
Whoa, baby.

228
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,880
Leave off, Mr. Bannon,
this ain't your business.

229
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,480
Your business is killing Apaches
and making the soldiers back you up.

230
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,680
Take him back to the stables,
he'll go now.

231
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,360
All it was, he wanted more water
and more water's bad for him.

232
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,520
So you jerked at him.
Horse hasn't got much sense, Baker.

233
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,200
He depends on you for that.
You come at him scared and tough,

234
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,880
and he'll be scared and tough.
Tougher than you.

235
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,280
Come at him gentle, he'll be gentle.
Take him along.

236
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,440
Be kind to animals,
from a white Apache.

237
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,080
Apaches don't like horses, sergeant.

238
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,040
They ride them till they drop, kill them
and eat them, then steal some more.

239
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,840
You even think like an Apache.

240
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,760
You gotta think like them
to lick them, sergeant.

241
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,040
Why don't you get out of here.
You've been fired.

242
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,400
Nobody around here can stand
the smell of you.

243
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,560
Before you go,
this is from the colonel.

244
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,840
Only an Apache would've broken
your back, sergeant.

245
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,960
All right, break it up.
Let him through.

246
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,080
You lived with them
and you got to be one of them.

247
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,000
- But they kicked you out.
- And you're using us to pay them back.

248
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,160
- You got us ambushed.
- Where you going?

249
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,080
- He ain't going nowhere.
- Let him have it. Get him!

250
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,760
- Get in there!
- Hold him down there! Let him have it!

251
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,520
We gotta even this up, friends.

252
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,840
All right, break it up. Fall out.
Dismissed, all of you!

253
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,920
- You want me to say thanks?
- Get out of here while you can.

254
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,120
- I'll say it to you.
- Come on, Ed.

255
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,400
Would you say everything's
in order, sergeant?

256
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,240
Yes, sir. I'd say.

257
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,760
You are awake at last?

258
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,960
Put the laundry over there, Spanish.

259
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:01,480
You can go now, Spanish.
Thanks. Get out. Get out!

260
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,560
He understands Apache
better than Mexican.

261
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,320
Same as you, pretty.

262
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,000
I came here before.
It was empty. I went away.

263
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,400
- I got here as quick as I could.
- No, you did not.

264
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,560
You went first to the widow
of the officer.

265
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,200
Pay my respects.

266
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,640
Afterwards you have a fight.

267
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,400
You fought because you were called
a white Apache.

268
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:39,520
Did real good with the sergeant too.
Made another enemy, faithful for life.

269
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,560
All this you did when you knew
Nita was waiting.

270
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,840
Believe me, I could've done
without doing it.

271
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,520
Will Bannon say he is glad
to see me now?

272
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,200
Get me a drink.

273
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,320
What makes an Apache so pretty?

274
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,960
Must be her Spanish blood.

275
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,200
- Maybe her love for you.
- I know that's her Spanish blood.

276
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,840
We drink.

277
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,880
It's against the law
for an Indian to drink.

278
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,200
I drink in Spanish.

279
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,280
- Mexican.
- Mexican and Spanish.

280
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,840
Mexican, Spanish, Apache.

281
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,800
If only you were ugly.

282
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,080
I love you, Bannon.

283
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,600
What you'd love is for Bannon to tell
you what he heard in his mind

284
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,880
while he was out in the field.
Did he hear the Apache drums?

285
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,440
Did he hear the singing
of the wise men?

286
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,240
How much does he know?

287
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,240
Does he know
what'll happen tomorrow?

288
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,760
Bannon is wrong.
He knows my brother and I

289
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,920
were cast out by the Apaches
because our blood was not pure.

290
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,880
They put you here
to keep an eye on me.

291
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,640
That's all right.

292
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,000
I can keep an eye on them
through you.

293
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,760
It all depends on which of us
gives something away first.

294
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,200
Get me another drink.

295
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,160
Why don't you come in.

296
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,120
Do you want me to put
your laundry away?

297
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,520
Official business, Ed.

298
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,200
You're paid up
through the end of the month.

299
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,200
I'll need your signature
on your discharge papers.

300
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,240
You gonna introduce me
to my replacement,

301
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,080
as long as he's drinking
my whiskey?

302
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,080
There's no need for us to meet.

303
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,760
We know about each other, Bannon.

304
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,200
Jerry August, bargain maker.

305
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,760
Jerry believes in showing the Apaches
we want peace.

306
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,680
He'll be a lot better
to have around than you

307
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,000
with the Chiricahuas coming
in tomorrow.

308
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,160
How much do you know about
Chiricahuas?

309
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,760
Enough, even though I didn't get
to be one of them.

310
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,080
- Get him out of here.
- He's taking over your quarters.

311
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,520
You mean, like, tonight?

312
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,720
That's up to you.
You gotta be out of here by morning.

313
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,840
I'll be out.

314
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,480
Bill.

315
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,120
If the Chiricahuas
come in tomorrow,

316
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,200
and if Toriano
comes home tomorrow,

317
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,400
don't think of it as good.
Think of it as bad.

318
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,840
And watch out.

319
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,160
Unless we do it your way, you don't
give us half a chance, do you?

320
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,120
This is the right way, Ed.

321
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,040
The house is clean.
It wait for furnitures. Bring furnitures.

322
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,880
- This is it.
- What is this? Furnitures?

323
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:14,480
All right. The saddle will be a chair.
The bridle will be a curtain.

324
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,240
The blanket is to be a rug and a bed.
And this going to be table.

325
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,480
We just need a place to come back to.
It doesn't have to be a hotel.

326
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,120
Don't be angry.

327
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,760
I'm in a hurry. Toriano's supposed to
come in from the East this morning.

328
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,680
You don't believe?

329
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,480
The soldiers are making ready
to receive the Chiricahuas.

330
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,320
You will go out
to see them come in?

331
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,880
First I want to see
if Toriano comes in.

332
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,440
You better stay here
and glue yourself back together.

333
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,960
You got a wagon
due from the train depot.

334
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,160
Little late, isn't it?

335
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,600
Just a little. Don't wait for it in here,
Mr. Bannon. You get out.

336
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,360
You're not paid to put people out,
Johnny.

337
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,560
Toriano's coming in on that wagon,
Mr. Bannon.

338
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,560
That's why you're here.

339
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,040
But I've been waiting for this ever since
he went back to that Indian college.

340
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,040
Toriano's more than my friend.

341
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,600
We played together
when we were young.

342
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,720
Look at this.
We made ourselves blood brothers.

343
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,440
There's just one way an Apache
can put an end to that relationship.

344
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,400
He kills you.

345
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,520
I don't feel about Apaches
the way you do, Mr. Bannon.

346
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:20,720
I got a graduation present for Toriano,
and my son's middle name is Toriano.

347
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,720
That's real friendly.

348
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,320
And now he's coming back.

349
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,960
And I don't want you here
to spoil it for me when I see him.

350
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,480
Mr. Gunther.

351
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,440
Whoa.

352
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,600
Toriano. Welcome back.
I'm glad to see you.

353
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,560
It's good to see you, Johnny.

354
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,440
You look fine. Come inside,
I've got two surprises for you.

355
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,760
- I'll come back later.
- I've got a graduation present for you,

356
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,080
and I've got a son.
You can guess what his name is.

357
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,360
Do you wear that collar
to hide the scar?

358
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,000
I never want to hide it

359
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,520
or forget who gave it to me.

360
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,760
You want to meet your people
as they come in?

361
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,760
Toriano, come on inside
and get your present.

362
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,160
When I come back for this.

363
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,360
Johnny, do you have a horse
I can borrow?

364
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,520
Take the sorrel.

365
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,160
I brought a guest. Toriano.

366
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,480
- We've never met. My name...
- I know you, Captain North.

367
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,040
We've met many times.

368
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,960
In my thoughts.

369
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,520
Your father, Chattez,
and his people were to be here by now.

370
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,720
They are here.

371
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,440
Mr. Bannon,

372
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,840
you've no longer an official capacity
in this formation. You're dismissed.

373
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,160
I want you to know I see this,
but I don't believe it.

374
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,280
You and your people
aren't coming in

375
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,640
to be shipped off
to a Florida reservation.

376
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,240
Bannon, get out.

377
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,600
You've convinced the Army,
but I wanna know what you're up to.

378
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,480
I'll be around watching you.

379
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,880
Any move you make, I'll be around.

380
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,720
- Sergeant Stone.
- Yes, sir.

381
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,440
See that Mr. Bannon
leaves the formation.

382
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,120
Forget it, I'm on my way.

383
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,840
Sir, the United States Army
appreciates and respects

384
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,120
your arrival here.

385
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,320
Toriano is here, and I see him!

386
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,960
- Toriano! Toriano!
- Toriano! Toriano!

387
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,200
There has been much time
between us, my father.

388
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,640
During that time, I have come
to believe the soldiers are our friends.

389
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,640
I have asked them to move us
to a place where my young men

390
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,760
will not die fighting their brothers
and the whites,

391
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,280
for a land where each year
there is less food to feed us.

392
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,920
We've arranged for a place
for your people to wait, sir.

393
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,080
We'll escort you.

394
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,960
We're to wait there until all other
Apaches come in.

395
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,880
Then you'll escort us to the railroad,
put us in boxcars

396
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,000
- and ship us to Florida?
- And no blood spilled.

397
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,240
Your father not only signed the treaty,
he requested it.

398
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,440
Will you take us to the place
that has been arranged for us?

399
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,160
Tell your people to follow me.

400
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,760
Name?

401
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,120
Your name?

402
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,640
Look,

403
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,440
you may not wanna wear
one of these, but you got to.

404
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,320
We wear them,
it's a means of identification.

405
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,480
Make them give their names.

406
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,840
All right, give your name.

407
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,360
Things would go much better
for you if you do.

408
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,240
You wanna eat better, live better,
give your name.

409
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,360
Don't make any promises
we can't keep.

410
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,000
Give your name.

411
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,960
Bannon.

412
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,480
Help Stone identify these men.

413
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,320
I have no official capacity
in this formation, captain.

414
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,400
Remember?

415
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,120
If your people won't name
themselves,

416
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,520
you'll have to name them, sir.

417
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,360
So they can have collars
around their necks, like oxen?

418
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,400
So we can feed them, bed them down
and count for them.

419
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,480
This is the military's idea.
Let the military carry out their idea.

420
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,200
Bill.

421
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,480
Anything Toriano's for, I'm against.

422
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,880
In my unofficial capacity,
I'll see what I can do.

423
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,840
This one's Kuni.

424
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,840
He speaks English, all right.
Just playing dumb.

425
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,840
Kuni.

426
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,160
Tag number B, one.

427
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,240
Next.

428
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,920
What's the matter, Wakamaza?

429
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,840
Ashamed of your name
because I killed your brother?

430
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,760
Wakamaza.

431
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,600
Tag number B, 15.

432
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,840
Next.

433
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,320
Look, I'm not getting paid for this.

434
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,560
Let's get Toriano
and his honored father tagged.

435
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,440
Save time.
The rest won't give you any trouble.

436
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,280
- You're next.
- Wait a minute.

437
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,200
Toriano can decide for himself.

438
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,000
He's next.

439
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:03,040
- Toriano! Toriano!
- Toriano! Toriano!

440
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,240
- Toriano! Toriano!
- Toriano! Toriano!

441
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,960
Others in the school
cut their hair like white men.

442
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,280
I did not.

443
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,280
I am not a white man.

444
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,320
I will go next in line.

445
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,640
My father will follow me.

446
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,720
- The name is Toriano.
- Toriano.

447
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,040
Tag number B, 160.

448
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,600
- And this is Chattez.
- Chattez.

449
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,600
Tag number B, 155.

450
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,720
Name, Goli.

451
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,280
Name, Doron.

452
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,320
- Name, Nanez.
- Name, Tucsos.

453
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,680
Wait a minute. Now that you're
in such a hurry, slow down.

454
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,400
Kind of gave you the short end,
didn't he?

455
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,040
Going in, aren't they?

456
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,560
That's what you want, isn't it?

457
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,680
Toriano.

458
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,680
You are certain
now is the time for you?

459
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,960
I have waited five weeks
to be certain.

460
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,920
My thoughts tell me
my people can wait no longer.

461
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,760
How is it with my father?

462
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,360
You above all others know.

463
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,920
Then it is good, so far.

464
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,760
It is my hope.

465
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,960
You do not believe?

466
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,200
I believe...

467
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,240
...in what has been handed down
to me to believe.

468
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,240
Then all is good.
It has been foretold.

469
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,760
Now I will say it.

470
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,520
Wait a minute! Geh! Geh!

471
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:02,560
Toriano comes. Toriano comes!

472
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,280
Hear me.

473
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,160
In this land, there is a place where
we drink the water and it cools us.

474
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:35,240
Where the fish, the turkeys,
the buffalo, the deer are our food,

475
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,440
but we kill only when we are hungry.

476
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,840
The land I speak of is ours.

477
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,240
It is here, beneath our feet.

478
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,800
But a fort has been built upon it.

479
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,280
A pen for us has been built upon it.

480
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,200
I have been in the East.

481
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,080
In my thoughts
there have been visions.

482
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,040
The Great One put us here
on earth first.

483
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,960
He is displeased with those
who have come second.

484
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,320
To please him, we must rid the earth
of these second-comers.

485
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,720
The ghosts of our fathers demand this.
And they have shown us a way.

486
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,800
To please the Great One,
we must dance before we kill.

487
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,400
We must dance to let the ghosts
of our fathers know

488
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,240
that we obey their wishes.

489
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,840
We must dance the ghost dance.

490
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,760
And I will show you how it is done
as it was given to me in my vision.

491
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,520
All will dance in toward the fire,

492
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,080
crushing out the white-eyes.

493
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,960
Then back...

494
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,720
...then in again,
crushing them more each time.

495
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,800
And we will sing of death
to the white-eyes.

496
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,640
- Ten-hut!
- As you were, soldier.

497
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,520
Everything in order, corporal?

498
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,240
Seems to be, sir.
Outside of that racket out there.

499
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,440
I found this on a tree back there.

500
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,400
- Ed Bannon been through here?
- No, sir.

501
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,680
Hold that.

502
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,960
You're not going in there, sir.
They'll tear you to pieces.

503
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,400
Keep them till I get back.

504
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,920
Bannon!

505
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,960
I've come to speak with Chattez.

506
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,600
You will speak with Toriano.

507
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,720
And there is little time left
for you to speak.

508
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,520
You are even less wise
than I thought.

509
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,040
Bannon, the Apache killer,
has walked toward Toriano...

510
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,200
Unarmed. I know Apache law.

511
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,880
It will not be us who break our law.

512
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,800
- Kuni, where is his knife?
- There was no knife.

513
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,560
You have been a quick thinker.

514
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,320
You have remembered
your Apache training

515
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,000
and come among us
alone and unarmed.

516
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,920
I will not break the law this time.
You will not be touched this time.

517
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,360
From now on, whether you have
weapons or not, you will be killed.

518
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,200
The warning is fair.

519
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,840
Go and let yourself not be seen
by us again.

520
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,200
Chattez.

521
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
You were always the wise one.

522
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,600
There is a new thinking
in the beat of your drums,

523
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,920
a new dance.

524
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:29,000
I want to be told what they mean.

525
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,880
So that we may more easily be killed.

526
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,640
- You will go before you are killed!
- Toriano! Remember the law.

527
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,280
I will go...

528
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,280
...but first, listen to these words.

529
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,640
I do not stand among men.

530
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,600
Around me are the animals
I ran from.

531
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,800
Whenever I am called an Apache,
I grow sick with shame

532
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,080
because I lived with you
and I know you.

533
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,480
Because I know you, I don't believe
you've come to this place in peace

534
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,920
as the soldiers believe.

535
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,320
But I tell you this:

536
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:16,600
I know the beat of your drums
and the words of your thoughts,

537
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,040
and I'll learn the meaning
of what you've started tonight.

538
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,640
Whatever it is, I'll fight against you
until those Apaches still alive

539
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,400
will look back on this night
as the worst in their memory.

540
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:34,920
And you will get down on your knees
and thank Johnny Gunther

541
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,360
for being your blood brother.

542
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,800
- Toriano!
- My father will be silent.

543
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,480
He has no weapons either.

544
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,880
Another minute
and we were coming in after you, sir.

545
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,720
Another minute
and you wouldn't have had to.

546
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,840
You're post commander now,
captain.

547
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,960
What made you go in there anyway?

548
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,280
Because I never know
what you're gonna get us into next.

549
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,640
Corporal, arrest this man.
Take him to the guardhouse.

550
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,320
Are you crazy?

551
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,000
You stir them up. With you out
of the way, we'll all be better off.

552
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,360
- Till further orders, corporal.
- I'm a civilian. What's the charge?

553
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,480
Out of uniform, off-limits,
absent from formation, take your pick.

554
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,480
- Get him out of here, corporal.
- Walk!

555
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,840
You dirty, double-crossing,
hardheaded, blue-belly...

556
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,920
Post number seven! All secure!

557
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,520
Post number two! All secure!

558
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,960
Magazine! All secure!

559
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,400
What you doing around here,
Spanish?

560
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,800
Smelling around the magazine
for all those Apache rifles

561
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,760
- that were brung in here?
- I don't blame him.

562
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,120
At $110 apiece,
he can smell, can't he?

563
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,960
You know what I'd do
with just half the money

564
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,200
them Winchesters would bring?

565
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,600
Kuni.

566
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,080
Toriano.

567
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,080
You never came for your present.

568
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,680
It's been five weeks.

569
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,480
I almost got to thinking
you didn't want it.

570
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,040
Keep your present.

571
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,240
What's the matter?

572
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,320
You and I are blood brothers.

573
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,560
Sure. I'll never forget that summer.

574
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,680
- We hunted, fished, played together.
- That was a mistake.

575
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,320
What do you mean?

576
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,640
No Apache such as I may have
a white man for a blood brother.

577
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,920
Your death will make up
for my mistake.

578
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,840
Toriano...

579
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,960
...this is Johnny.

580
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,880
I want you to meet my son...

581
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,440
...named after you.

582
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,960
Let's go!

583
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:17,960
Devils! Coyotes! Let's go!

584
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,760
Still can't get it, huh?

585
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,720
Chattez ain't trying
to contact his son?

586
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,640
No.

587
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,560
It's like nothing I ever heard.

588
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,440
Come on, let's get down to the sutler's.
That noise is driving me crazy.

589
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:33,360
I don't sit around and listen to it
all day like you do. Come on.

590
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,840
I thought I knew every ritual
in the Apache book.

591
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,240
This one's got me beat.

592
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,280
It comes close, then it goes away
before I can grab it.

593
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,560
When I was with them, young,

594
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:54,200
something I was told
or saw or found out.

595
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,920
It's there, but I can't bring it back.

596
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,440
You will. Come on.

597
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,040
You wanna go back
to the guardhouse?

598
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,680
I didn't let you out
to come nosing around. Let's go.

599
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,080
I didn't have any idea
of going in among them.

600
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,360
- I'm just listening.
- You're always listening.

601
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:16,600
Look, I got Jim Eagle and Jerry August
out to find Toriano.

602
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,960
If the Apaches come in,
they'll get a fair trial.

603
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,440
Only the guilty will be punished.

604
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,440
I can see Toriano and the rest
running neck and neck

605
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,600
to get back here and get hanged.

606
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,280
Don't leave this post, understand?

607
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,240
You know, I could make a lot
of trouble for you

608
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,080
for throwing me in the guardhouse
the other night.

609
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:37,200
- Sergeant Stone.
- Yes, sir.

610
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,120
Detail a man to guard
Bannon's quarters.

611
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,680
Ives, you heard the captain.

612
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,920
Captain, you're a smart man.

613
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,000
Got lots of brains,
you're real intelligent.

614
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,440
Just kind of stupid.

615
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:17,720
I made one of these
like the soldiers do.

616
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,400
They are not good.

617
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:24,280
Where's Spanish been
since Toriano broke out?

618
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,640
Hiding, maybe.

619
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,720
Toriano's free,
and Toriano never trusted Spanish.

620
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,440
What's his backbone made of?
Soup?

621
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,760
Don't talk against my brother.

622
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,880
The Apache in him came out,
didn't it?

623
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,680
He's with Toriano now.

624
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,920
You will be here tonight?

625
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:00,400
Don't worry about me,
I'm not going anywhere.

626
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,160
Corporal.

627
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,440
Just drop it.

628
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,160
Over here.

629
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,600
Inside.

630
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,720
Corporal!

631
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,880
Corporal of the guard!
Over here!

632
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,320
On the double! Corporal!

633
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,280
Well, it figures.

634
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,200
Tamos, Nayoni, Ochoa Flats.

635
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,320
Now here.

636
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,640
It's the circle.

637
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,320
I think they're swinging
too wide for a circle, Ed.

638
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,360
Maybe they're not using
a pattern at all.

639
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,680
Apaches always use a pattern
for their campaigns.

640
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,800
I've seen them fight in a circle
covering hundreds of miles,

641
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,400
or an X as big
as the whole Territory.

642
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,080
Even a zigzag pattern.

643
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,320
We gotta be sure
which one they're using now.

644
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,880
I'd say the settlement at Torva's next.

645
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,400
Well, if you're right,
then it's a circle for sure.

646
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,040
Come on.

647
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,000
- Maybe they didn't see us.
- Maybe you've lost your mind.

648
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,680
Devils! Coyotes!

649
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,800
Some of you look around.

650
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,720
Go!

651
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,720
This occasion means a lot
to the Army and to me.

652
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,400
Corporal Eagle.

653
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,240
Jerry. I want to extend
the Army's thanks.

654
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,040
More important, here's two months' pay
for both of you. Have a good time.

655
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,960
Excuse me, ma'am.

656
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,760
Lee...

657
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,320
...I came over for some more
of your husband's whiskey.

658
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,840
You've been drinking all day.

659
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,560
I've lost my taste for that stuff
they sell at the sutler's.

660
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,160
I didn't think you'd show
your face back here.

661
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,840
Ed, sit down, please.

662
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,120
Nita, will you get a chair.

663
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,560
I don't want a chair.

664
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,160
I don't like your company.

665
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,800
What's the celebration?

666
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,440
Jim Eagle and Jerry August
contacted Toriano.

667
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,680
He's gonna parley with us.

668
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:56,440
We'll discuss the peace terms
that both the Army and Chattez want.

669
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,680
What makes you two think
you can guarantee Toriano

670
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,200
will hold still for a peace parley?

671
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:05,080
We found him.
We talked with him.

672
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,560
He gave us his word.

673
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,000
His word.

674
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,040
How did you find him?

675
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:14,600
It's plain you didn't see him,
or if you did, you ran.

676
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,480
That's right.

677
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,520
- I ran.
- It figures.

678
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,840
You're the reason Toriano left here.

679
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,040
You know he's not gonna trust you,
because he knows you don't trust him.

680
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:29,960
- Trust an Apache?
- That's right. Trust an Apache.

681
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:33,440
All of you trusted Nita's brother,
Spanish.

682
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:37,520
Fine, upstanding, educated Apache.

683
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,920
Only there wasn't one of Toriano's
burnings and killings he wasn't in on.

684
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:48,280
Yesterday, he pushed a Winchester
in my face. Tried to pull the trigger.

685
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,360
Souvenir from a fine,
upstanding Apache.

686
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,880
Where's Spanish now?

687
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:07,800
Probably still at the bottom
of the creek, where I left him.

688
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:19,400
- You dirty, lying...
- That's enough.

689
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,120
Bannon, this time you're going
to that guardhouse

690
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,800
for as long as I can make it stick.

691
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:27,640
This time any of your blue-bellies
lays a hand on me, I'll cut it off.

692
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,520
You're going out tomorrow
to parley with Toriano.

693
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,520
Well, there won't be any parley,
there'll be an ambush.

694
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,000
Because you listened to Jerry August,
who listened to Jim Eagle,

695
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,920
- who's an Apache.
- Shut up.

696
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:44,480
Corporal, I apologize for this civilian.

697
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,440
Go back to your quarters.

698
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,440
As long as this civilian's here,
can I go?

699
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,080
Go ahead.

700
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:57,280
You don't have to apologize for me.

701
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,160
I don't care what happens
to any of you,

702
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,720
just so I know you were warned first.

703
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,760
And I'm warning you.

704
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:09,000
You can't make deals with Toriano.

705
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,760
You should know Toriano.

706
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,760
You were that high,
learning arithmetic.

707
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,400
I was that high,
learning how to cut a man's throat

708
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,560
so it takes him nearly a day to die.
That's Toriano.

709
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:23,960
Ed, you'd better go.

710
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,880
There's a scar on Toriano's neck.

711
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,280
I gave it to him
because he was a good Apache.

712
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:31,120
He had a baby brother born sickly.

713
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,520
Like a good Apache, he took him out
and bashed his head against a rock.

714
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,720
I tried to stop him.

715
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:41,400
Toriano fought better Apache
than I did. He still does.

716
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:45,040
So I had to run and keep on running.

717
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,840
Nearly ten years now.

718
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:51,240
I had a ranch down near White Sands
they burned.

719
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,320
I never could get set up again.

720
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,400
Had to keep on moving.

721
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,480
Trying to settle down, just live.

722
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:03,640
But they were always
one step behind.

723
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,840
A man gets selfish living that way.

724
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,200
Scared too.

725
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:15,160
Finally, I figured out they wouldn't
always be one step behind.

726
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,600
They had to be stopped.

727
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,240
And the Army
was the best stopper I know,

728
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,840
with me to show them a few tricks.

729
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:28,080
But the Army likes and respects
the Apache.

730
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,760
The Army wants to make peace.

731
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,720
Orders...

732
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,680
...are orders.

733
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:39,800
You go on out tomorrow
and try and make peace.

734
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,600
See how many of you come back.

735
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,760
Sir, let me lock him up.

736
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,480
Ed.

737
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,240
Why didn't you tell me?

738
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,800
Tell you what?

739
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,840
I wish I could have been
with you all those places

740
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,880
you had to run away from.

741
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,840
You never told me
you just wanted to...

742
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,840
What you said, settle down and live.

743
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,360
Maybe I never really wanted to.

744
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,720
Maybe I was just scared.

745
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,760
When you're scared, you run.

746
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,400
I never thought you knew
how it is to be scared.

747
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,240
Name a day when I'm not.

748
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,800
I love you, Ed.

749
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,640
You've always known.

750
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,680
Better come in, Lee.

751
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,240
You gonna make a point
out of this too?

752
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,960
You think Lee hadn't better
get back to her guests?

753
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,680
I'll go wherever Ed goes.

754
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,400
Where?

755
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,600
To his shack?

756
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,000
What'll you do about his laundress?

757
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,640
Try it when you're sober.

758
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,880
What's the difference? According
to him, I'm supposed to be dead

759
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:14,280
- with my whole company tomorrow.
- You're not going out.

760
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,640
Not after what he just told you.

761
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,080
You should understand the Army, Lee.

762
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,720
You were about to marry it again.

763
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,680
Remember?

764
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,960
Ed?

765
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,880
You're not going to let him go.

766
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,520
Can you see me stopping him?

767
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,640
But you'll go with him.

768
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,640
I'm not just about to go with him.

769
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,720
But you said he wouldn't come back.

770
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,040
You said none of them
would come back.

771
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:47,040
Why don't you go back in there
and worry about him.

772
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,640
You can worry together.

773
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,600
- What's the matter?
- Ask her.

774
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:41,000
The Apache in you finally came out.

775
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,800
You killed Spanish.

776
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:51,840
Maybe I killed Spanish
because he tried to kill me.

777
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,160
He was with Toriano.
They were waiting for me.

778
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:58,960
Maybe you went to Chattez
and told him I'd gone out,

779
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,120
that's why Toriano was waiting.

780
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:06,640
You don't know. You are not sure.

781
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,400
I'm sure of one thing.

782
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:12,160
I'm gonna have you locked up
for a long time.

783
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,160
The Apache in you won't like that.

784
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:18,360
Especially because you won't be
any use to Toriano, locked up.

785
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:20,480
Call the sentry.

786
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,280
- The sentry?
- Well, call him.

787
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,760
Hey, sentry, over here!

788
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,320
You will have me lock inside
a prison room for a long time?

789
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,360
That's just what I'm gonna do.

790
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,040
Over here, sentry!

791
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,360
In here, soldier!

792
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,720
Toriano.

793
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:03,400
- What's the trouble?
- Somebody tried to knife somebody.

794
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,520
Don't touch me.

795
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,600
I hated your hands on me.

796
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,840
I failed...

797
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,440
...but my people will not.

798
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,960
Even now,

799
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,440
the dance they are making

800
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:32,240
will protect them
when you go out against them.

801
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:39,880
My hope is that you are alive...

802
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,920
...when they take you.

803
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:53,200
There's a dead Apache in here.

804
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,000
- Get it out.
- First, I gotta report this

805
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:58,400
- to the officer of the day.
- Get it out.

806
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:34,240
Forward, ho!

807
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,640
Come to say goodbye?

808
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,160
Where are you going?

809
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:07,320
Getting out of here. About time too.

810
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,640
Without letting me know?

811
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,480
Did you want to know?

812
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,440
I heard about Nita.

813
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,160
I'm sorry.

814
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:18,280
Sorry for her or sorry for me?

815
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,760
I guess for you both.

816
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,400
Look.

817
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:38,320
Kirk's wife, Miss Mason

818
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:42,080
and a lot more of their women
who don't have the nerve to ask.

819
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,080
That's why you're here.

820
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,840
Is it?

821
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,360
They want me to catch up
to North's column and persuade them

822
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,320
to turn around before it's too late.

823
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:55,000
Can you blame them?
They're worried about their husbands.

824
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,760
They believed what you said
last night.

825
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,160
What do you believe?

826
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,680
It's hard for me to tell you now.

827
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,080
You try.

828
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:10,000
In the first place, I don't believe you
can persuade Bill North to come back.

829
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,520
That's right.

830
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:17,680
Orders are orders. Never mind what
happens, as long as they're carried out.

831
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:25,360
Then you're not going out to try
to save the others.

832
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,320
I'm glad.

833
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,080
What do you mean?

834
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,880
I want you to stay alive.

835
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:36,040
Well, they're your people, not mine.

836
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:37,840
They're Army.

837
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,360
Do you want to see them get killed?

838
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:43,000
You said you didn't know
whether you were selfish.

839
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,920
Well, I'm selfish, I guess.

840
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,880
I just want you to take me with you
wherever you go.

841
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:52,920
Seems to me, if we're gonna catch up
to that column,

842
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,280
- we ought to get started.
- All right!

843
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,480
I might have known.

844
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:05,640
I just don't want the Army messing up
my chances at Toriano.

845
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,720
Ed...

846
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,160
...please come back.

847
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,840
Just for a minute.

848
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,000
I'll come back.

849
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,680
Yo!

850
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,760
Sir, it's as we said.

851
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,840
There's Toriano. He waits for us.

852
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:43,160
Sir, I'd take the column in slow
from here on in

853
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,920
so they'll know we're not
up to any tricks.

854
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,560
Forward, yo!

855
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:08,720
Better hold them here, sir.
I'll go up first with Jim Eagle.

856
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,120
Get out of here!

857
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,800
Take cover in the trees!

858
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,600
Horse-holders, take cover!

859
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,440
What are they doing?

860
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,280
They're bunching up to rush us.

861
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,560
We can take the first rush.

862
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,720
Maybe the second.

863
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,960
Not the third.

864
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,560
All I want is for Jim Eagle
to be with them when they come.

865
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:16,720
Yeah.

866
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,680
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

867
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,120
Hold your fire.

868
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:37,080
All right, you think they're coming
to dinner? Knock them down!

869
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:07,600
Sounds like we got here
lastest with the leastest.

870
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:13,320
Well, they never spring an ambush
without planting outposts somewhere.

871
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,480
That looks like
as good a spot as any.

872
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,840
Hold your fire!

873
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,640
Commence fire!

874
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,600
Toriano. Look.

875
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,280
We have been warned.

876
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,160
More of the white-eyes are coming.

877
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,520
There are not enough of us yet.
We will ride away.

878
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:26,240
In a few days, there will be more of us
than the white-eyes ever dreamed of.

879
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:41,600
- They're pulling out.
- Why?

880
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
I'd say we got less than half left, sir.

881
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:01,880
Yeah.

882
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:05,520
Look what's coming.

883
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,200
Stay here.

884
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:27,480
What did you do, follow us
to make sure you were right?

885
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:30,800
- Take it easy, Bill.
- Don't give me the easy.

886
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:34,760
- How many men did you lose?
- Half my command.

887
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:37,440
Because I trusted Apaches.
I wouldn't listen to you,

888
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:38,880
I listened to orders.

889
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,920
It could've been all of us, right here.
Only they pulled out.

890
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,680
They saw some smoke
and they pulled out.

891
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,320
Who do you think
sent up that smoke?

892
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,120
You did.

893
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,760
You knew about Jim Eagle too,
didn't you?

894
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:56,880
Well...

895
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,280
...how long before you say,
I told you so?

896
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,640
Consider it said.

897
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,600
All right!

898
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,760
The last order the colonel gave me
was to fire you.

899
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,560
That's right.

900
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,160
Well, we're gonna junk the orders.

901
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,400
We're gonna pull out of here and
go back and fight Apaches your way.

902
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,400
We can do it my way now.

903
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:22,920
What do you mean?

904
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:27,000
We can hit Toriano when he
least expects it. Right now.

905
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,720
We haven't got enough men.

906
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,680
We've got enough to do it my way.

907
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,160
Give me your attention!

908
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:58,000
This command is going
after Toriano. Now.

909
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,080
On my responsibility,

910
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:04,800
we'll take our orders
from Mr. Bannon.

911
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,680
I'll make it short.

912
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:13,320
There's only one way
to beat the Apache.

913
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:17,560
Fight the way he fights. Hit and
run until he can't run any more.

914
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:22,080
You'll throw away every piece
of equipment that rattles.

915
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:27,720
Each man will carry food, water,
ammunition and one blanket apiece.

916
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:31,120
That's all. Let's get started.

917
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,000
We bury our dead first.

918
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,600
That's exactly the kind of mistake

919
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:42,120
Toriano would expect you to make,
lieutenant.

920
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,640
I said, we start now.

921
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,680
All right!

922
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,920
Start rounding up your mounts!

923
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,800
Cease-firing! Hold your fire!

924
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,080
Why don't we keep after them
while we're still on our feet?

925
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,600
- We got them on the run.
- Bannon says we don't chase them.

926
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:36,320
- You'll get along, soldier.
- Why don't Bannon fight with us

927
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:39,200
- if he knows so much about?
- As you were, sergeant.

928
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:46,200
We could've done more damage
if we'd have kept on.

929
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,080
Chasing them is the best way
to let them know

930
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,520
this is all the men we've got.
Let's get going.

931
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,040
We could stand a short rest.

932
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:57,200
The pattern Toriano's using, I figure
he'll work to the right, then bear back.

933
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:00,520
If we go straight ahead, we can
be waiting for him. Let's get at it.

934
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:03,760
Sir, Mr. Bannon might not be as tired
as the rest of us

935
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:06,480
because he's been careful
to keep himself out of the fighting.

936
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:09,880
All Toriano has to do
is find out I'm with you.

937
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:13,680
If he changes to a pattern I don't know,
we'll never know what hit us.

938
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:16,400
Get the detail moving, sergeant.

939
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,840
All right, climb aboard!

940
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,760
Climb aboard!
We're going for another ride.

941
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:25,200
You take the point, Sandy,
quarter of a mile ahead.

942
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,080
Fire!

943
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:51,920
Cease-fire!

944
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,280
Few minor wounds, that's all.

945
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,920
Good, we can keep going.

946
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:08,120
Ed, the men can hardly move.

947
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,960
All right. Give them a breather.
Forty-five minutes.

948
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,120
- Thanks.
- But not here.

949
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:18,320
We'll ride a mile or two,
in case Toriano decides to come back.

950
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,560
All right, off and on.

951
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:24,040
We're taking another ride.

952
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,920
Wakamaza is coming.

953
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:48,680
Bannon. He's with them. I saw him.

954
01:24:58,120 --> 01:24:59,680
He is dead.

955
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,240
He will not mind if we leave him.

956
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,440
And he brought good news.

957
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:12,080
Bannon will be at our meeting
place tomorrow!

958
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,360
Come on!

959
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:33,240
Toriano.

960
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:36,200
That dust looks like he picked up
some friends.

961
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:39,440
We've got about ten seconds
to make it into that draw.

962
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:50,920
Halt! Halt!

963
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:52,960
Dismount! Fight on foot!

964
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:58,360
Dismount! Fight on foot!

965
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:23,360
- Why don't they come at us?
- Ask Bannon.

966
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:39,600
How's he got so many all of a sudden?
Why don't they come in?

967
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,680
- I don't know.
- Up till now you've known.

968
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:45,280
Now you don't know.

969
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:04,800
I think they left the hill.

970
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:08,520
They left five minutes
after it got dark.

971
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:11,800
- Where are they?
- Around.

972
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,400
- Close?
- Maybe.

973
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,280
Thanks.

974
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,840
- Cronin?
- Yes, sir.

975
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,480
See anything on your side?

976
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,120
No, sir.

977
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:32,040
What do we do? Wait for them
to jump us out of the dark?

978
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:35,520
- I've had enough of this waiting.
- Easy down.

979
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:38,000
They're either out there
or they're not.

980
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:42,400
- There's only one way to find out.
- Jordan, don't go out there!

981
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:46,400
Keep down. Everybody.

982
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,960
- That's one of my men out there.
- Kirk!

983
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:27,000
I know how he feels.

984
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:31,320
- Do you?
- That could be Sandy yelling.

985
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:06,160
Where you going?

986
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:12,000
Bannon's gotta know
what Toriano's doing out there.

987
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:14,320
You can't go out there.

988
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:18,000
Just don't let Bannon know.
Don't tell him.

989
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,240
Captain, over here.

990
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:06,880
Hold it! It's Jim Eagle.
We're gonna take this one back.

991
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:27,480
They got Sandy.

992
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:34,440
Every Apache knows the worst death
is by hanging.

993
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:38,520
We'll take you back to the post
and hang you.

994
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,920
You'll never get back to the post.

995
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:45,920
Then I'll hang you myself here.

996
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:48,640
Tie him up.

997
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:06,880
Maybe they'll hold Sandy
as a hostage.

998
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:15,080
Hold it.

999
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:21,920
They're not coming in.

1000
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,640
What's going on?

1001
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:42,720
All this time, and I couldn't catch it.

1002
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:48,000
Now he's telling me.
I should've remembered.

1003
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:50,040
What is it?

1004
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:53,240
- Prophecy.
- Prophecy?

1005
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:57,560
They never talked it.
It was always written,

1006
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:01,600
carved in a tree, painted on a rock.

1007
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:06,200
The Invincible One would appear
and lead them to victory

1008
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,120
over the white-eyes.

1009
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:15,240
He would be one of their people
and he'd come out of the East.

1010
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:17,640
That fits Toriano.

1011
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:22,560
That's why he went Back East
to school, so he could make it fit.

1012
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,680
No wonder he never came in.

1013
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:28,680
Got a bunch of those tribes with him.

1014
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:33,160
They'll come at us at dawn
like the end of the world.

1015
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:38,760
He wants me to sweat that
all night long.

1016
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:42,360
What happens now?

1017
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:45,040
I'm not gonna sweat it.

1018
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:47,520
How long till dawn?

1019
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,680
Less than an hour.

1020
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:54,240
- I'll be back.
- You crazy?

1021
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:57,760
Not many people out there now.

1022
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:01,280
Most of them have gone
to be with the Invincible One.

1023
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:03,360
Stick around.

1024
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:28,480
Toriano.

1025
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:35,200
Over here.

1026
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:45,720
Or I show them
how invincible you are.

1027
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:52,520
Over here.

1028
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:04,360
Drop it.

1029
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:13,960
- Why don't you shoot?
- I'd like to.

1030
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:19,720
Put your wrist out.

1031
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:22,400
Put it out.

1032
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:42,800
Against mine.

1033
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:47,640
Say it.

1034
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:51,360
Our blood is joined.

1035
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:55,400
We are brothers as long
as both of us live.

1036
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:58,080
That's right.

1037
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:02,840
Now you don't dare
risk attacking us,

1038
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:08,480
for fear somebody else but you
might kill your blood brother.

1039
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:59,600
Fire at will!

1040
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:15,040
Cease-firing! Wait! Wait!

1041
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:19,480
- Hold it.
- Hold your fire!

1042
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:25,040
I tried the only thing I could think of.
If it doesn't work, nothing will.

1043
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:28,600
It's just that from now on,
we can't fire.

1044
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:31,440
- They're coming in.
- We got no choice.

1045
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:35,160
Bannon!

1046
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:39,760
There will be no more killing
until Bannon has met Toriano.

1047
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:45,400
Do you hear me? Is it agreed?

1048
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,800
I can hear you.

1049
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:51,080
I agree.

1050
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:16,760
My blood brother will meet me
on the adobe hill at daybreak.

1051
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:20,040
He will come empty-handed,
as will I.

1052
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:23,160
I agree.

1053
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:27,520
Free Jim Eagle.

1054
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:40,200
Mr. Bannon.

1055
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,680
Want me to hold your coat?

1056
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:07,120
We'll do more good up there.
Let's go.

1057
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,080
Let me alone.

1058
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:22,440
Over there!

1059
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,920
Hear me.

1060
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:09,560
You listened to the Invincible One.

1061
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:13,400
You have left your homes
to follow him.

1062
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:19,720
There's your Invincible One.

1063
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:22,760
Where's his magic now?

1064
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:31,280
Which of your people will Chief
Chattez trust now that Toriano's gone?

1065
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:35,560
- I will be the one.
- You will be the one.

1066
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:40,280
But remember, Chattez wants
only peace for the Apache.

1067
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:45,000
- Will you take your tribe back to him?
- I will take them back.

1068
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:50,120
All of you, go back to your homes.

1069
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:52,320
This was a false dream.

1070
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:56,320
Toriano was false,
or he wouldn't be dead now,

1071
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:59,320
killed by the white-eyes
he was going to kill.

1072
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:03,920
Do I speak the truth?

1073
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:07,000
You have heard the truth.

1074
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:30,760
- You be all right?
- Yeah, how about you?

1075
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:33,680
I'll be all right.

1076
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:38,280
Forward!
