of all those outrages...

176

the whole point is...

177
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:50,266
whetherJoseph Smith or
any other American citizen...

has a right to worship God
as he chooses.

179

i'd like to tell you
a little bit aboutJoseph Smith.

<i>Now, me,</i>
<i>I'm just an ordinary everyday fellow.</i>

181
00:15:01,814 --> 00:15:05,113

do a little carpentry work...

to make a living.

to find the right church...

for me and for my family, and i was
willing to give them all a try.

00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:17,128
But somehow none of them
hit me just right.

there was anything wrong
with them for other people.

00:15:21,534 --> 00:15:24,025
i'm just saying
they didn't suit me.

188
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:28,064
One day i picked up
The Book of Mormon...

189
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,268
<i>and I said to my friend</i>
<i>Heber Kimball...</i>

''Heber, let's go out to Ohio
and see this prophet.

to say for himself.''

we came up toJoseph Smith's house...

00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:44,056
and his wife Emma
came to the door.

came to the door.

whereJoseph Smith lives?

- Yes.
- We'd like to talk to him, please.

for a prophet to be out swinging an ax.

Won't you sit down?

What's this about you folks
calling yourselves saints?

210
00:16:48,821 --> 00:16:51,312
Well, we believe
that any man, dead or alive...

211
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,381

the Ten Commandments is a saint.

212

You don't pretend to be
the Lord himself, do you?

213
00:16:55,895 --> 00:17:00,525
No. i'm just a mortal man,
same as you or your friend here.

214
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:04,467
Well, this plan of yours
you call the United Order,
what's that?

215
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:07,233
it's not my plan.
it's the Lord's.

216

what is it?

you'd call it the law of nature.

218

that the land of Zion will
be sort of like a beehive...

219
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:22,881

his share of the work...

<i>the old folks.</i>

226

You see, under
a brotherhood plan like that...

227
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:45,639
it'll be impossible for any one man
to pile up a lot of goods...

Now, gentlemen,
i'm not asking you to believe...

247
00:18:48,374 --> 00:18:50,740
a single thing
Joseph Smith said...

248

but i do ask you--
let him believe it.

249
00:18:54,346 --> 00:18:56,644
Let me believe it
if we want to.

250
00:18:58,284 --> 00:19:01,219
Your forefathers and mine
came to this country
in the first place...

251
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:05,951
for one great reason--
to escape persecution
for their beliefs...

252
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:11,622
and to build a free country
where everybody might
worship God as he pleased.

253
00:19:11,697 --> 00:19:14,757
That's what brought
the Puritans to Massachusetts...

254
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:16,995
the Quakers
to Pennsylvania...

255
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:21,369
the Huguenots to South Carolina,
the Catholics to Maryland.

256
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,307
And when they found
what they were after...

257
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:27,834
they fought a great war
to hold on to it...

258
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:31,280
and they drew up one
of the noblest documents ever written--

259
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,980
the Constitution
of the United States--
to govern free men.

260
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:39,491
And the very first words
they put on that piece of paper...

261
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:42,721
guarantees to every man...

262
00:19:42,795 --> 00:19:44,990
the right to worship God
as he pleases...

263
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:49,967
and prohibits Congress
or anybody else...

264
00:19:50,035 --> 00:19:54,335
from ever doing anything
to take away that right.

265

You zigzag out

My name's

We folks have been run
out of our homes...

and some of us
are pretty tired and sick.

744
00:58:58,081 --> 00:59:01,517
We'd like to stop
in Council Bluffs for a while.

745
00:59:01,585 --> 00:59:03,519
My people knows
of your coming.

746
00:59:03,587 --> 00:59:05,521
We know why you are here.

747
00:59:05,589 --> 00:59:09,081
As Superintendent of indians,
my advice is to say no.

748
00:59:09,159 --> 00:59:13,892
Not many years ago,
we were driven out of our homes.

749
00:59:13,964 --> 00:59:15,955
You are welcome here.

750
00:59:16,032 --> 00:59:18,967
Chief, those are the first words
of real welcome...

751
00:59:19,035 --> 00:59:20,969
we've heard
in 1 6 years.

752
00:59:21,037 --> 00:59:23,972
And don't think
we're going to forget them.

753

You can count on us
for anything you want.

We're welcome here!

We can stay here
as long as we want to.

756
00:59:43,793 --> 00:59:45,784
Unhook your oxen,
turn them out to graze.

We're welcome here.
We can stay as long as we want to.

759
00:59:53,036 --> 00:59:55,027
Oh, i'm so glad,
Brigham.

760
00:59:55,105 --> 00:59:58,097
Tell everybody to unhook
their oxen and horses.

761
00:59:58,174 --> 01:00:02,133
<i>They can hunt too.</i>
<i>This country is running</i>
<i>over with wild game.</i>

01:00:02,212 --> 01:00:04,146
Look, Brigham,
good, rich earth.

763
01:00:04,214 --> 01:00:07,911
Sure.
Anything would grow here.

764
01:00:09,452 --> 01:00:12,512
i think i'll let the main body
stay here and raise a crop.

765
01:00:12,589 --> 01:00:15,149
The rest of us will push on
and find someplace to settle in.

766
01:00:15,225 --> 01:00:18,160
They can follow us later
and bring whatever they've raised.

767
01:00:18,228 --> 01:00:21,163
Tell the people the band's
going to play tonight.

768
01:00:21,231 --> 01:00:25,167
Tell them we're going
to sing and dance like we used to.

769
01:00:25,235 --> 01:00:27,669
First you tell us
we can rest.

770
01:00:27,737 --> 01:00:30,035
Now you say
we have to dance.

since we started out.

- it looks good.

773

i'm going to take a bath,
even if i muddy up
the whole dang river.

774

You'd better go now,

you're going to be awful busy.

Jonathan.

780
01:01:12,782 --> 01:01:15,273
Why didn't you tell me
about Eliza?

781
01:01:15,352 --> 01:01:18,788
She didn't want me to.
None of them did.

782
01:01:18,855 --> 01:01:21,790
She told me
to tell you, Brigham...

783
01:01:21,858 --> 01:01:25,294
that even though
we might be the last wagon...

784
01:01:25,362 --> 01:01:28,229
we'd never be
the first to fall out.

785
01:02:02,832 --> 01:02:05,630
i just couldn't go away
without leaving her
some kind of marker.

786
01:02:07,137 --> 01:02:09,128
You know,
Ma used to say...

787
01:02:09,205 --> 01:02:12,140
that a good wheel
always sings.

788
01:02:25,722 --> 01:02:28,623
Ma would've loved
those flowers.

789

No, thanks.

''Am i stronger than this tobacco or is
this tobacco stronger than me?''

Yes, sir.

a new leader.

it's up to me and you to see
that the Lord's will be done.

if there's all that gold
out in California...

it seems strange and peculiar
nobody's heard about it before.

The Lord chose
when he wanted it known...

and who he wanted
to know it.

- All that gold in California.

Wish i had an orange
right now.

Oh, about
a million things.

needs a new doubletree.

01:21:19,788 --> 01:21:22,222
We left every cent,
everything we owned in the world.

1028
01:21:22,291 --> 01:21:25,055
We've watched you mark every
foot of the way up here...

1029
01:21:25,127 --> 01:21:27,960
with the bodies
of our women and babies,
and we haven't said a word.

1030
01:21:28,030 --> 01:21:31,193
But when it comes to stopping
and settling in a place like that--

1031
01:21:31,266 --> 01:21:33,496
the most desolate country
we've seen yet--

1032
01:21:33,569 --> 01:21:37,369
with California just up ahead waiting
for us, it's time to call a halt.

1033
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:39,634
He says God told him
this is the place.

1034
01:21:39,708 --> 01:21:42,268
But i say it was
the devil talking.

1035
01:21:42,344 --> 01:21:44,335
And as far as i'm concerned,
the devil can keep it!

1036
01:21:44,413 --> 01:21:47,109
- We're going on!
- All right, Angus.

1037
01:21:47,182 --> 01:21:49,912
That's the way
to California.

1038
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:53,684
i'm not
going to stop you.

1039
01:21:53,755 --> 01:21:55,916
i wouldn't lift
my little finger to hold you...

1040
01:21:55,991 --> 01:21:57,959
or anybody else
that feels the same way.

1041
01:21:58,026 --> 01:22:01,120
Moses went up in the hills
like this once...

1042
01:22:01,196 --> 01:22:04,188
and right away the devil
started putting in his licks.

1043
01:22:04,266 --> 01:22:07,724
Remember how he got the people
to build a golden calf
and to start worshipping it?

1044
01:22:07,803 --> 01:22:10,135
<i>You remember how mad</i>
<i>God and Moses got...</i>

1045
01:22:10,205 --> 01:22:14,471
<i>and how close God came</i>
<i>to washing his hands</i>
<i>of the whole business?</i>

1046
01:22:14,543 --> 01:22:16,477
i don't claim
to be a Moses...

1047
01:22:16,545 --> 01:22:19,878
but i say to you just what
he said to the sons of Levi:

1048
01:22:19,948 --> 01:22:24,044
''Who is on the Lord's side,
let him come unto me.''

1049
01:22:24,119 --> 01:22:27,646
Well, you can have
your desert. i'm going
to California.

1050
01:22:27,723 --> 01:22:30,624
[ Angus ] Come on.
You said you were comin', didn't you?

1051
01:22:32,461 --> 01:22:34,395
You're goin',
aren't you?

1052
01:22:35,631 --> 01:22:37,622
<i>Well, are you comin'</i>
<i>or not?</i>

1053
01:22:38,834 --> 01:22:40,768
<i>Think of your family</i>
<i>and your children.</i>

1054
01:22:40,836 --> 01:22:44,795
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>
<i>You're not gonna build your home</i>
<i>down in that desert, are you?</i>

1055
01:22:44,873 --> 01:22:48,206
You'll all starve to death.
Come on. Get up and get goin'.

1056
01:22:48,277 --> 01:22:51,178
You said you were comin' with me.
Think of your family!

1057
01:22:56,918 --> 01:22:58,852
Our hearts...

1058
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:03,357
are mighty humble
and mighty thankful.

1059
01:23:03,425 --> 01:23:05,916
Lord, we'll make
this desert blossom.

1060
01:23:07,029 --> 01:23:09,395
There'll be hamlets
and cities...

1061
01:23:09,464 --> 01:23:11,625
vineyards and orchards...

1062
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:14,066
with every kind
of tree there is.

1063
01:23:14,136 --> 01:23:16,696
There'll be no filth
in our cities.

1064
01:23:16,772 --> 01:23:19,240
There'll be no ugliness
of any sort but...

1065
01:23:19,308 --> 01:23:23,369
broad, clean streets
with flowing water.

1066
01:23:23,445 --> 01:23:26,744
<i>And the law of the valley</i>
<i>shall be that...</i>

<i>no man may buy or sell land...</i>

1068

<i>for all land</i>
<i>will be held in common.</i>

1069
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:37,055
<i>It'll be measured off</i>
<i>to him, both in the city</i>
<i>and for farming.</i>

1070
01:23:37,125 --> 01:23:39,923
<i>And any man may have</i>
<i>as much as he can till...</i>

1071
01:23:39,995 --> 01:23:42,896
<i>but he's got to take care</i>
<i>of all he gets.</i>

1072
01:23:42,964 --> 01:23:46,161
<i>All wood and timber will</i>
<i>belong to the community, too...</i>

1073

<i>as well as ditches</i>
<i>and canals.</i>

1074
01:23:49,104 --> 01:23:52,631
<i>Any person caught</i>
<i>trying to take greedy advantage</i>
<i>of these materials...</i>

1075
01:23:52,708 --> 01:23:55,700
<i>will be run</i>
<i>out of the valley.</i>

1076
01:23:55,777 --> 01:23:57,745
<i>Now, as to the city itself...</i>

1077
01:23:57,813 --> 01:24:01,874
<i>it shall be built in</i>
<i>blocks of ten acres each...</i>

1078
01:24:01,950 --> 01:24:05,113
<i>with streets</i>
<i>eight rods wide...</i>

1079
01:24:05,187 --> 01:24:07,985
<i>and with gardens and lawns</i>
<i>on both sides.</i>

1080
01:24:08,056 --> 01:24:12,789
<i>Right in the middle,</i>
<i>I'm setting aside ten acres</i>
<i>for the temple...</i>

01:24:12,861 --> 01:24:16,695

<i>the day we get our first crop</i>
<i>in the ground.</i>

1082
01:24:16,765 --> 01:24:21,725
<i>We're going to establish</i>

to see you people...

1091
01:26:05,307 --> 01:26:08,071
come up here to put your food
in a common storehouse...

1092
01:26:08,143 --> 01:26:11,840
to be rationed out
to everybody alike
during the coming winter.

1093
01:26:11,913 --> 01:26:15,679
Joseph Smith
would be proud of you.

1094
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:18,810
it's not just a tithe
we're giving this time...

1095
01:26:18,887 --> 01:26:20,855
although that's the law
of the church...

1096
01:26:20,922 --> 01:26:22,981
but everything we've got.

1097
01:26:23,058 --> 01:26:25,424
if one eats,
we'll all eat.

1098
01:26:25,494 --> 01:26:27,758
And if one starves,
we'll all starve.

1099
01:26:29,464 --> 01:26:32,729
Now, we're gonna have
our hands full to make this food
last until spring.

1100
01:26:32,801 --> 01:26:35,031

Oh,Jonathan. i'd like for you to go
with Porter back to Council Bluffs.

1114
01:27:26,721 --> 01:27:29,087
Tell the people there
to harvest their crops...

1115
01:27:29,157 --> 01:27:31,216
but that they must stay there
through the winter.

1116
01:27:31,293 --> 01:27:34,387
Then they can join us in the spring
and bring whatever food's left.

1117
01:27:34,462 --> 01:27:37,192
Well, i--

1118
01:27:37,265 --> 01:27:39,324
i'll look after them.

1119
01:27:39,401 --> 01:27:42,097
- Will you do it?
- Why, yes, sir.

1120
01:27:42,170 --> 01:27:46,539
- When can you start?
- i'll be ready to leave
by tomorrow morning.

1121
01:27:48,476 --> 01:27:50,410
Thank you,Jonathan.

1122
01:27:50,478 --> 01:27:52,446
- That all right with you, Porter?
- Fine. See you in the morning.

Good.

1124

How long
are you gonna be gone?

1125
01:28:45,634 --> 01:28:47,568
Four or five months,
i guess.

1126
01:28:47,636 --> 01:28:49,570
He has no right
to ask you to go.

1127
01:28:49,638 --> 01:28:51,572
You've got a family
to look after.

1128
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:53,574
Besides, there are plenty of others
who can go in your place.

1129
01:28:53,642 --> 01:28:56,907
You know how it is here.
Everybody has his job to do.

1130
01:28:56,978 --> 01:29:00,209
- This is mine, and i've got to do it.
- Brigham-- Brigham Young.

1131
01:29:00,281 --> 01:29:02,841
Don't you care what
anybody else thinks or feels?

1132
01:29:02,917 --> 01:29:05,511
- He's head of the church.
- Even if he is, he isn't God.

1133
01:29:05,587 --> 01:29:08,750
- He can't run everything.
- He'll look after you
and the children.

1134
01:29:08,823 --> 01:29:12,350
i can look after the children,
and i'm not worrying about me.

1135
01:29:12,427 --> 01:29:15,157
it's just that--
Oh.

1136
01:29:40,088 --> 01:29:42,249
i'm sorry that you
had to go and get mad.

1137
01:29:42,323 --> 01:29:44,985
- i'm not mad.
- 'Cause if you hadn't been mad...

1138
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:47,119
i had it in my mind
to tell you about something.

1139
01:29:47,195 --> 01:29:50,164
i'm not mad!

1140
01:29:50,231 --> 01:29:53,200
Well, if you'd been
in smilin' good humor,
i meant to talk about it.

1141
01:29:53,268 --> 01:29:56,635
- Talk about what?
- What i was gonna talk about...

1142
01:29:56,705 --> 01:29:58,639
if you hadn't got mad.

1143
01:29:58,707 --> 01:30:00,641
Maybe you had
a revelation.

1144
01:30:01,910 --> 01:30:04,845
Well, you might
call it that.

1145
01:30:04,913 --> 01:30:07,711
We ought
to get married right away.

1146
01:30:08,917 --> 01:30:11,147
- Right away?
- Well, in the spring...

1147
01:30:11,219 --> 01:30:13,483
soon as i get back.

1148
01:30:13,555 --> 01:30:16,251
Well, i don't see any sense
in puttin' it off any longer than that.

1149
01:30:16,324 --> 01:30:19,122
Oh, but your Brigham Young'll
want you to marry a Mormon girl,
won't he?

1150
01:30:19,194 --> 01:30:21,128
- Several of them.
- Several?

1151
01:30:21,196 --> 01:30:24,165
if you're gonna be rich,
you'll have to have
a lot of wives, won't you?

1152
01:30:24,232 --> 01:30:28,032
i've been wonderin' how you're
gonna go about askin' 'em--
one at a time or all together.

1153
01:30:28,103 --> 01:30:31,504
Maybe it would be easier if you said,
''Sisters, will you kindly marry me?''

1154
01:30:31,573 --> 01:30:34,633
- Zina!
- Then after you've married
20 or 30 of them...

1155
01:30:34,709 --> 01:30:37,439
suppose you get to lovin'
one more than
all the rest put together?

1156
01:30:37,512 --> 01:30:40,879
Then there's poorJonathan,
loving one and divided by 30.

1157
01:30:40,949 --> 01:30:42,883
Now, Zina, you're
just talking nonsense.

1158
01:30:42,951 --> 01:30:46,853
There they'll be, all darning
the same socks and cooking
for the same man...

1159
01:30:46,921 --> 01:30:49,321
and all talking about
<i>their</i> husband.

1160
01:30:49,390 --> 01:30:53,224
Just imagine, 30 wives
combing your beard!

1161
01:30:59,567 --> 01:31:03,059
You haven't answered
my question yet
about our being married.

1162
01:31:04,873 --> 01:31:08,138
Oh, well, it--
it isn't spring yet.

1163
01:31:18,219 --> 01:31:20,187
Well, figure it out
for yourself.

1164
01:31:20,255 --> 01:31:22,314
Say every man's
got 20 wives.

1165
01:31:22,390 --> 01:31:24,358
- There aren't that many women.
- Oh, we can get 'em.

1166
01:31:24,425 --> 01:31:27,588
Women convert easy. And say
