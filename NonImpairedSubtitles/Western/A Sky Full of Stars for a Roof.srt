1
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,172
Get down, you!

2
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:04,780
No, no!

3
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:25,673
Well, where is he?

4
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,080
For her we had to waste the whole day?

5
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,443
I heard Willer was supposed
to be coming this way.

6
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,212
He must have been taking the
trail west. Let's go.

7
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,150
That may be, but
we ain't taking you along.

8
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:42,158
My father don't wanna hear any more
stories, okay? Now find that bastard!

9
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,990
Hey, here they are! Here they are!
I can see them!

10
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,953
They're coming! They're coming!
Hey, girls!

11
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,820
Alright, goon.
You, move it! Brlng the beer!

12
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,498
And you, fill up those glasses!

13
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,000
Let's make these boys
feel welcome! Ladies...

14
00:07:58,811 --> 00:07:59,800
They're coming!

15
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,983
Put a smile on your face!

16
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,782
Hurry, hurry, hurry,
come and see the mermaid!

17
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,885
The only living mermaid!
She's the eighth wonder of the world!

18
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,454
Half woman, half fish!
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

19
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:42,713
She is like no other mermaid
you've ever seen before!

20
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:43,686
Let go of me!

21
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,222
I saw her first, let go!

22
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:46,791
No, me!

23
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,790
I mean it!

24
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:05,900
Three jacks.

25
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,141
Three aces.

26
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,008
Are you playing, pal?

27
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:14,742
Yeah.

28
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,381
You shouldn't play that hand.

29
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,117
Oh, it's you! Find a chair, and sit down.

30
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,661
It's more than likely that
this man is stealing your money.

31
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:24,692
What do you mean?

32
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,928
Well, I'm only stating an opinion.

33
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,034
Well, you know what? Nobody asked you.

34
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,634
No sir, not really.

35
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,431
Okay, mister, I'm busy.

36
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,940
I'd better be moving on,
because you know how it is,

37
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:39,443
you just might have
an ace up your sleeve--

38
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,279
I got no gun, mister.

39
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,484
Well, what's this?

40
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,247
The very ace I was talking about.

41
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:04,829
Harry, what did you do that for?

42
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:58,649
Come on, Harry!

43
00:10:58,724 --> 00:10:59,281
Watch your head!

44
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,480
You stay right where you are!

45
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,314
And you, why don't you buy
yourself a gun?

46
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,821
I can 't shoot.

47
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,150
So learn!

48
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,524
It's easier said than done. Watch?

49
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,931
See what happens to my hands?

50
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,231
It's always been like that.

51
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,202
Got delicate nerves,
that's your trouble.

52
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:51,036
Here, try this.

53
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,709
That's murder!

54
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:02,985
Where did you get it?

55
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,087
I have my little means...

56
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,670
Maybe you should stick to fire,
rather than fool around with poker.

57
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,096
What if I hadn't been there?

58
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,975
Well, now you don't ask me
things that I...

59
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:28,743
l'm not as innocent as all that. But,
mister, you didn't tell me your name yet.

60
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,543
Tim. Just how much did you lose?

61
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:36,579
A drop in the ocean, Tim.
Here, I still got this...

62
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,259
A little bag of gold.

63
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:46,263
You'd better look around and
find a good place to store it.

64
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:46,990
The bag is safe.

65
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,897
They'll find it. Do you think your drawer
is any kind of protection?

66
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,097
Well, do you know of a place?

67
00:12:56,108 --> 00:13:01,273
A good old bank. Walk in, deposit it,
they give you a receipt.

68
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,575
That's the best way.

69
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,778
Anybody you know
have a bank, Harry?

70
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:09,552
No, unless you have?

71
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:13,091
In Pueblo City there's one.
I'll set you up.

72
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:18,089
No! l've never been in a bank,
and I feel just a little fear to go.

73
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,132
Are we too late?

74
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,427
Sorry, gents, the show is all over!

75
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,800
For a dollar?

76
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,636
It starts again!

77
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,338
But, tell me, how were
they able to catch her?

78
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,973
I don't know. With a line and a pole...

79
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,987
If she gets married, does she have to
get into his bed or...

80
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,527
is he getting into that tank?

81
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,962
Well, he'll have to get in there.

82
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,825
I mean... she can't stay
outside of the water.

83
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,436
Am I right!

84
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,197
A fish! Pure and simple!

85
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,506
Convinced? They have a special place...

86
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,273
Everything has its place.

87
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:11,679
Oh yes, that's true!

88
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,850
Even a sack of gold...

89
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,413
Gold...

90
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,088
In a bank...

91
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:22,686
Ah...

92
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:26,993
Ah yes, I'd better be going back. Listen:

93
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:31,599
I wouldn't try to influence you.
You go to bed and sleep on lt.

94
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,868
If in the morning you decilde to do it,
come on to Pueblo City. I'll be there.

95
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:50,077
Hey, mister! ls this here Pueblo City?

96
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,285
Are you sure?

97
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,759
Guess I ought to know. I am the sheriff,

98
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,830
and I youldn't be here
if I didn't know where I was!

99
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,159
You're right.

100
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:05,033
Looking for someone?
They're all working in the fields.

101
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:08,440
Trying to find something?

102
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:15,472
You're doing the right thing.

103
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:26,348
I've seen some poor, towns,
but this is the worst I've seen yet.

104
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,983
First impression. It's got potential,

105
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,892
and it will be the prettiest
little town in the whole state.

106
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:35,262
Business naturally is slow now,

107
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,559
but if you just wait in that chair,
you'd get to see it with your own eyes.

108
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:40,536
- No!
- Yeah.

109
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,609
Where is that bank
you were talking about?

110
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,575
Eh, over there.

111
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,772
That?

112
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,920
That's the only one there is.

113
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,584
After you.

114
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,704
I give three percent interest,
that's all.

115
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:22,979
Is that okay, three percent?

116
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,940
Is what okay?

117
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,913
You deposit the gold...

118
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,614
...and when you take it out,
you get some more.

119
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:31,878
More gold?

120
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:37,484
Alright there, you wanna make this
deposit or not? I ain't got all day!

121
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,200
I'm sorry, Harry,
but you should be more careful.

122
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,172
Now banks, they got vaults, don't they?

123
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,389
Of course, a bank always has a vault.

124
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,585
But I won't show you, young man.

125
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,857
I don't believe it:
He wants to see that vault.

126
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:15,422
Nobody gets to see our vault!

127
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:19,832
He's a banker, ain't he?

128
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,634
Thirteen ounces,

129
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:57,007
or value 673.00 US dollars.

130
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,241
You'll bee needing that receipt.

131
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,350
Well, thanks, and good day.

132
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:13,685
At your service, gentlemen.

133
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,498
And you? Where are you headed?

134
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,904
Ohl, I'll just ramble. 
I think I'll get a pole and some line.

135
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,267
A pole!

136
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:34,845
Yeah, I get it! The fish lady.

137
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,751
Hey Tim, I hope she takes the line!

138
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,615
Hey, honey, how about it?

139
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,193
We're paving guests!

140
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,763
We want to eat!

141
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,474
If she laughs again, l'll plaster her.

142
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,475
This won't cut.

143
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,149
We got nothing better.

144
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,795
Hey, she's right. It does cut...

145
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:45,425
Take it away.

146
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,302
Hey, bring me another knife...

147
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:53,470
You boys just see that you get him...

148
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,813
just a minute.

149
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,949
I'm gonna find that sugar-tongued rat,
no matter how long it takes.

150
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,818
When I get my hands on him, I'll...

151
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:09,425
Tell me where they went! The fish!
Where was she headed for last?

152
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:10,456
What direction?

153
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,085
That way, for Sandstone.

154
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,764
Yes, they did. Your friend was here,

155
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,263
with another fellow he started
to fight, and he had no gun.

156
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,928
Are you forgetting anything?

157
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:23,135
No, he didn't stay.
Probably left for good.

158
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,204
You know where he went?

159
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,207
I can't tell, mister.

160
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:34,910
That miner was with him, he'll know.

161
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:06,775
So he's Billy's pal.

162
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:08,752
Billy? I've never heard of
anybody of that name.

163
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,552
Now look, my friend, don't play cute.

164
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:13,920
I know you two had a fight
here the other night.

165
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:15,625
Oh, it was Tim!

166
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:16,952
Billy.

167
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,158
No, no, Tim, Tim, Tim.

168
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:22,256
Tim or Billy, it doesn't matter.
Do you know where he was heading last?

169
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,735
All I know is 
I'm gonna break open his noggin'!

170
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,501
You can't have Billy.

171
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:33,074
No, friend, l'm the one who's
gonna see to it. Remember me...

172
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:36,614
my name is Roger Pratt.
Doesn't that sound nice?

173
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,380
Alright, l'll see you again.

174
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,316
Hurry, hurry, hurry,
ladies and gentlemen!

175
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,583
Step right up, and gee
the marvellous mermald!

176
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:22,091
The only one of its kind in captivity.

177
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,719
She's on the inside folks.
Half woman, half fish!

178
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,630
She's in there, folks,
right inside the tent!

179
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:30,257
It will cost you 20 cents to have a look!

180
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:34,964
But what's 20 cents to see a
real mermaid! A freak and a miracle!

181
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:37,507
Step right up, folks, she's...

182
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:41,978
the eighth wonder of the world!
A really spectacular woman!

183
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,579
And you, sir, why don't you
have a look for yourself?

184
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:46,582
Hey, you!

185
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,345
I knew I'd find you here!

186
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:51,051
Hi, Harry!

187
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,681
Hey, you, the price is 20 cents!

188
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,425
Tim, you tell him!

189
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:02,358
You, that bank story,
the bank disappeared!

190
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:06,033
The bank that...
but no... did you ask?

191
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:08,029
Yeah, I'm asking!

192
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:15,540
Hey, you!

193
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:21,346
Now wait a minute!

194
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:23,885
Are you sure it disappeared?

195
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,614
Maybe it just moved!

196
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:38,797
Hey, that there ain't even a real fish!

197
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:39,632
You're a madnan!

198
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,707
You stole all my gold, you bastard!

199
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:57,319
I made a mistake. Just let me explain
it to you. I'll pay it up, really!

200
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,151
Then start paying!

201
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:02,021
If you knew how much I counted
on that gold, you wouldn't have took it!

202
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:06,655
But supposing that most of it's been
invested right here in the water show!

203
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:09,592
Invested?

204
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:11,831
All my gold?

205
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,700
If you figure how much you can get,
you can double that money!

206
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:17,434
This show is a real gold mine!

207
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,241
And so... there is no more?

208
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:24,081
lt's all here, really!
The fish tank, it ain't so awful!

209
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:25,740
This is gonna make you a bundle!

210
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:31,314
Are you sure that, this here mess is
mine right here? The fish tank, the tent?

211
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:33,317
This is a fine joke!

212
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:34,851
What am I gonna do with this stuff?

213
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:39,662
What will l do with the fish girl?
No, for crying out loud!

214
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,091
Not with the hammer!

215
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:46,936
Everything was just starting...

216
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:55,134
No! No!

217
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,225
That tent was new! What will I do now?

218
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,087
Oh, sorrv!

219
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,471
Breaking my wagon!
You ruined everything!

220
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,565
Now get out of this wagon, go on!

221
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,248
Well, why did you go
and wreck the wagon, too?

222
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,614
Now won't you understand
that you threw away your own money?

223
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:38,211
So that's it? You owe me slaps
I took because of vou.

224
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:40,181
How's that?

225
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,658
On account of a certain Roger Pratt.

226
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,023
What a mess you got me into!

227
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:50,434
Very old grudge.
Something that happened long ago.

228
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,545
Eight months of mine life,

229
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:03,605
to be on my ranch.

230
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,710
Ranch? What ranch?

231
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,914
The one I inherited from my uncle.

232
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,161
My pa wanted, after he died,
that I go back to it.

233
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:23,593
It's big ranch... heaven there...

234
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,426
far as you can see.

235
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:27,530
And turkeys.

236
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,206
No turkeys, no!

237
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:33,910
Prices are better now than they ever
were. Can't you just plcture that?

238
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,039
Hm, it's up to you, it's your ranch.

239
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,713
Hey, wait!

240
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,378
You want your gold or don't you?

241
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:42,316
Yeah, I want it, sure!

242
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,888
Let's go then, come on!
Or don't you trust me?

243
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,253
You're gonna get it,
and that's fact! Hm...

244
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,157
I'm watching you. Get a move on.

245
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,161
Just don't go trying
to cheat me twice.

246
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,467
Why you, get inside!

247
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:08,711
Adios! I'll buy you a new tank,
if you'll wait! So long, darling!

248
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:34,367
Hey, what the hell is this?

249
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,436
Would you please stop it?

250
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,301
You see I'm not toting a gun.

251
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,513
You don't live long
in these parts wthout a weapon.

252
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:48,750
I might have shot you, and then what?

253
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,881
Then you would have murdered
an unarmed man.

254
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,355
No.

255
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,749
I knew it.

256
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:13,268
Have you ever heard of Jessey James
and Rick Hitchgold and Hank Gaspery?

257
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:16,279
I heard they were the most vicious
in all the west.

258
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,677
And they all used guns. Murderers.

259
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:25,083
And they all died before they reached
thirty. No, guns only bring problems.

260
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:29,021
I prefer to do things clever.
There's much less danger.

261
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:32,295
Okay, so start doing something
clever about the gold.

262
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:34,627
Yeah, that's just what I was thinking.

263
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,846
Suppose we could sent
something to Boston?

264
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,755
We got a daughter who lives there.

265
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,297
You bet you can. Boston, New York,
Philadelphia, and Washington...

266
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,558
No, Washington no,
that's going too far.

267
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,998
And so Washington...

268
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:13,936
Come on! Are you gonna get
in touch with the big world?

269
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,771
I said don't touch that,
you'll get hurt.

270
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,240
Can't you keep still?

271
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,870
Seventy cents, better hurry up!
Who'd like to get in touch?

272
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:22,476
And they'll answer us, I suppose, eh?

273
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,548
Mister, this little machine will work
the same as any other.

274
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:27,709
Its workings are miraculous.

275
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,917
Excuse me, lady, this is urgent.

276
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,545
Write this down:

277
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:35,353
Come back this very day,
Violet Brodigan

278
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,188
Violet huh?

279
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,658
Brodigan. I'm Brodigan.

280
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,626
“Come home immediately,
and all is forgiven''.

281
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:45,692
If not, I'll shoot you both.
You stay and you'll see.

282
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:48,738
I'll put it in code, mister.
You pay the cash here.

283
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,699
Come-back-this-very-day-...

284
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,873
Violet-Brodigan: ..

285
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:16,392
Friends, do you or don't you?

286
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:20,130
Do you want to send a thank you
message from the whole town?

287
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,297
Okay, mister, we'll send
the president a message.

288
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:26,173
President of

289
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:31,544
the entire United States

290
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,443
Rutherford D.

291
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,987
Just that, mister.
He knows his own name, don't he?

292
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:42,423
Affront your own presidgnt, would you?
Why can't you show a llttle respect?

293
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,358
Western Junction would

294
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,632
like to give its thanks official

295
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:52,594
Mister, you better make that official!

296
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,668
Don't you think he can spell?
ls that his rank?

297
00:32:56,507 --> 00:33:01,308
Of course now then:

298
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:06,716
And we are anxious to bring
you our thanks

299
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,410
Official, right?

300
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:23,859
Hey, Mo! I think we've been took!

301
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,142
Hey! What have you just been doing?

302
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:40,183
Er, there's two men over in Westin,
passing strangers.

303
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:44,649
This morning me and Jonn were out poking
around, but there ain't no cable line.

304
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,684
Hn, I would like to hear
a bit more about this story.

305
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,454
It might be interesting to hear.

306
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,161
One, two...

307
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:57,564
You're feeling reassured?
Better watch what you see!

308
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:13,306
First note to mister Brodigan: You dear
Violet says she is coming tomorrow.

309
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:14,578
- Dance?
- Yes!

310
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,346
Drop that, Harry!
We've got to make tracks!

311
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:27,755
But we can't just leave this way!

312
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:28,620
Roger's here!

313
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:29,920
Hey, what about Washington?

314
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:32,018
Ah, you see, Washington's calling
on the other line.

315
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,859
The lines got crunched!

316
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:34,920
What line?

317
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:37,499
Hurry, Harry, hurry!

318
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:44,533
- They're over there!
- Let's go,

319
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:45,664
come on!

320
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:33,112
You go over there and stay down!

321
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:48,361
Let's separate, men! Youtake
that side, the rest come with me!

322
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:52,834
And now, Jack MacDonald, here we leave
you ln peace to flnd your eternal rest.

323
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:56,395
You're going to a far better place than
whence you came. You re leaving this Valley

324
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,975
of tears to take your place with the angels.
We know how much you suffered in this life.

325
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:04,603
We'd better be ggtting on
about our busmess.

326
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:10,176
All your pain and goodness and
graciousness harken those habitual evil...

327
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,983
Roger's boys are here, too.

328
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:41,317
...but I say to you, I want you to
have mercy: love your enemies...

329
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:43,143
l think we'll have to split up.

330
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:45,979
I have another way.

331
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,352
What another way?

332
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:52,755
Haven't you ever heard of
the late Jack MacDonald?

333
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,827
MacDonald who?

334
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,630
Harry, how long were you
in those mountains?

335
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:58,633
I don't know.

336
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:00,900
Little trigger Mac!

337
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:01,527
So what?

338
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,568
But you mean...you can't be telling me

339
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,439
you've heard nothing about
the Abbelane bank!

340
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:07,441
No.

341
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,036
Just 200 bags of gold, that's all...

342
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:11,907
He and his gang.

343
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,680
The federals put the others
out of the way.

344
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:17,945
Little trigger Mac made away with
200 bags of gold dust,

345
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:20,182
and no one's been able to find him.

346
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:25,759
Do you mean to say,
MacDonald there, it was him?

347
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,296
Oh, I'm tired of this.

348
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,362
If you're thinking of leaving,
that ll be alright. You can take all of

349
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:32,925
the profits we made with the telegraph,
and we can say that the book is shut.

350
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,835
No, no, you owe me more than just
those measly dollars in the cash box!

351
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,534
But don't you see I've just now
found I can pay you!

352
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,173
Just you imagine going along with

353
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:43,746
more money than you could possibly
spend in a lifetime!

354
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,839
But it's too good to be. Mean that?!

355
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,474
And we can even buy those turkeys!

356
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:48,574
No, no turkeys!

357
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,410
Our saviour, who watches,
will protect his chlldren...

358
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:54,886
But you think that really...
little trigger Mac is there?

359
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:57,358
Yeah, yeah! It's Jack!

360
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:01,389
But I bet you the booty is
still hidden around these parts.

361
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:06,599
If the widow will tell,
well... she ll tell me.

362
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,501
But how are you gonna
make the woman tell?

363
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,606
Just look.

364
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:24,317
I thought so. But if you even think of
cheating me out of my share,

365
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,753
I'll make you pay twice over!

366
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:26,982
Well, you'd better get out of here.

367
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,226
...dust thou art, and to dust thou
shall return... Thus says the Lord,

368
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:41,237
and we cry Halleluja and Amen. And I pray
to the Lord to look down on Jack's wife,

369
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:44,102
this inconsolable woman,
who devoted her whole llfe to your care.

370
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,176
And so, to the rest Jack.

371
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:52,011
Your speech was a beauty.

372
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:10,533
Mister, are you a friend of Jack's?

373
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:17,906
I'll never be able to forget Jack.
What a loss!

374
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:23,813
A marvel lous man, your Jack,
and mighty warm.

375
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,207
But he never even mentioned you.

376
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,121
Madam, you knew Jack,
you knew he spoke little.

377
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:33,182
Right?

378
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:53,438
Your kind words hqve given me
such comfort. I didn t here your...

379
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,705
It's Tim, Tim Hawkins.

380
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,575
You must call me Dorothy.

381
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:00,049
Tim! What is it?

382
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,582
It's alright...

383
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:07,552
Just a spell.

384
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:11,223
I galloped all night loqg to make
it here for you and Ben <i>s</i> sake...

385
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:11,920
Jack!

386
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:13,620
Yes, of course, Jack!

387
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:18,330
Do forgive me, 
I know how very good you've been.

388
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:21,028
I'll get you a little coffee,
if you d like.

389
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:39,120
A nice house. You live alone?

390
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,652
Yes, now I do.

391
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:49,593
You shouldn't you mustn't go to pieces.

392
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,964
Jack would never want me
to leave you like this.

393
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,069
He expressed it so simply:

394
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:58,835
Now look, Tim, if you can smile,
it will get better.

395
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,734
I'll make the coffee.

396
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:05,409
Yes, Jack would like to
see you like this.

397
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,496
Help yourself to some if you'd like.

398
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:27,766
Jack always preferred turkey.
lt smells so nice...

399
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:34,002
It's a good smell,
warfting upwards, full of purity.

400
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:38,275
But you never give it to Jack with
mournful eves, a smile is better.

401
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:39,743
You thought of every little thing.

402
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,340
I try to.

403
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:56,924
What do you want?!

404
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:57,796
Are you moving in there?

405
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:59,801
I might just do that.

406
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,537
But... I can't always...

407
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:07,904
Better now, Dorothy?

408
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:11,675
Better, but I'm still...

409
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:13,544
Yeah...

410
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,586
maybe we should finish this here turkey.

411
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:43,238
Are you okay?

412
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:46,639
The money is buried over there, over there
under that bush near the fence, you see?

413
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:50,703
I'd better keep the widow
busy while you dig for it.

414
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,806
I'll dig for it, but are you sure?

415
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,146
Sure I'm sure! Right over there!

416
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:56,444
I'll do it.

417
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,888
Oh...no...no,

418
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,090
please... I better not... Oh...

419
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:40,781
Poor Jack, rest his soul.

420
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:45,123
What a sad life he had!
Never able to leave his wheelchair!

421
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:48,164
I'm sure God will show him
how to walk again in heaven.

422
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:50,598
Yes, right now he is walking
among the stars.

423
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:51,691
What a nice thought!

424
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:55,900
What did you say?! Jack couldn't
get out of his wheelchair?!

425
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:59,338
For how long? Tell me about Jack!
Since when had been like that?!

426
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:02,344
He was seven years old
and fell off a donkey, and...

427
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,880
Tim! I'll kill you!

428
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,143
What the... What's going on?

429
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,680
You dirty sidewinder!

430
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:19,354
I'm your pal!

431
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,302
You'll pay this time!

432
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:41,114
Help! They won't stop!

433
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:44,176
They're wrecking the house!

434
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:47,449
Somebody call the sheriff!
Someone call the sheriff!

435
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,746
It's his fault! What do you want
to keep me here for now?

436
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:17,044
Haven't you two destroyed a house,

437
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:20,715
haven't you disturbed the poor lady,
you and your friend, too?

438
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:23,185
And you dug a big hole
and you caused a brawl.

439
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,956
Come on, stop saying such stupid things.
It's about time you let us out of here!

440
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:30,356
You'll have to wait in there
till the judge gets here,

441
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:33,436
or pay 70 dollars,
and that's for the both of you.

442
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:38,036
You can't wreck this town!

443
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:55,122
76, okay,

444
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:57,318
that's 76 dollars.
Now that I'm going, Tim,

445
00:49:57,694 --> 00:50:02,028
let's just say this brings
an end to our partnership.

446
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,301
But... you mean you won't pay mine?

447
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:06,693
No!

448
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:25,985
So now it's finished.

449
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:29,054
You're leaving me this way?

450
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,195
Is that what you want?
What a fool you are.

451
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,221
There's a bunch of jackasses outside,

452
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:37,463
waiting to bray at you...

453
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:45,907
How wi ll you manage alone?

454
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:49,644
They don't scare me; It's you they're
after, not me! It's your business!

455
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:51,373
That you were with me is enough.

456
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:55,076
Roger never asks any questions.
He'll shoot you.

457
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,978
You figure it will get better
if I stay?

458
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:05,819
Sheriff, I've got the money!
Enough for both of us!

459
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:24,904
You can't have your guns
until after the trial. Come on out.

460
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,255
Aren't you coming? I paid.

461
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:37,656
No, not yet, Harry.

462
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:42,821
It's not so simple, but don't worry,
wake me in six hours.

463
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:32,711
How much did we make today?

464
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,750
Two dollars and 70 cents.

465
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:36,207
Hi, friend!

466
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,014
Oh, no, it's him! What do you want?

467
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:40,055
Hey, don't start yelling!

468
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:43,416
Is this any way to greet a person?

469
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:48,287
Can you beat that?
You don t want me around!

470
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:51,299
Please, I haven't recovered yet from
the last time! Out, I say!

471
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,825
Shhh, that's not helping.

472
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:57,765
I propose that we make
an association, huh?

473
00:52:58,074 --> 00:53:00,668
You know what I always say:
First see my lawyer.

474
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:03,712
But aren't you even thinking
about your future vet?

475
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:06,143
If all you want is a penny

476
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:09,377
and a freak show, why don't you complain
about it, tell me!

477
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:13,020
Do you know how much money it would take
to get this thing into condition again?

478
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:16,253
Oh, let's get out of here.
We'll move out tonight.

479
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:18,885
You are a lunatic.

480
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:20,494
What's your hurry anyway?
Why leave tonlght?

481
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:24,897
But I think we shopld.
Maybe we shouldn t.

482
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:27,159
This is your miss, let her say.

483
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:29,830
He's right. This once, let'go.

484
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,665
We're out of money.
Broke is what you call lt. Heh!

485
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:35,309
You've got almost no business.

486
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:37,538
I 've got here your man
who can get it for you!

487
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:39,512
You've only got to get
at it this second!

488
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:41,010
Let's take a look at this miracle!

489
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,751
Er, yeah... 
I'd like to see the miracle.

490
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:53,860
And so now, we offer the demon
from below, the human salamander!

491
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:59,027
He is known as Fogo, and he gets beans
like you folks eat your dinners!

492
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:02,593
Only don't forget:
he first sprinkles it with fuel oil!

493
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:06,737
And for his first act
he'll present his halo!

494
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:08,777
If they spotted us
what are we gonna do?

495
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:11,210
A spectacle never
before seen on this earth.

496
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:12,178
We're gonna out this on.

497
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:18,112
The very, the only,
the human salamander!

498
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:19,747
Go, go on!
Now settle down...

499
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:22,755
It won't take but another moment before
we go on with the show, folks!

500
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:24,717
Why, he is just preparing.

501
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:25,859
Go on! Go!

502
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:28,556
And here he is!

503
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:43,067
More!

504
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:09,936
Tim, they're out there,
I saw them! Where ls Tlm?

505
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:16,677
You're crazy!

506
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:17,474
Why?

507
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:18,478
But, my husband!

508
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:20,276
Oh, don't worry!

509
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:21,776
You must be crazy!

510
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:23,375
Just be quiet...

511
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,217
Are you gonna do it?

512
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:31,417
Uh-huh.

513
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:47,941
You're really something, Tim.
You'll be staying, won't you?

514
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:50,839
Yeah, just for the present.

515
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:54,543
I'm leaving as soon as
we get out of this place.

516
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,550
 There's a ranch
Just past Jubilee Creek.

517
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:02,250
It's pretty...

518
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:08,021
Fire Harry owns it, but l began to think
of that little old place as if were mine.

519
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:09,454
Bravo!

520
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:20,503
Fire! Fire!

521
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:23,904
Roger !

522
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:29,677
Okay, run for it!

523
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:32,311
My clothes!

524
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:34,151
Hey, where are you both going?!

525
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:36,817
Help! Fire! Don't, don't!

526
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:44,724
It's burning up! Oh!

527
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:58,146
Oh no, I'm ruined!
It's burning up! Oh!

528
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:06,677
Better not do it...,

529
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:12,212
My pa will want to know him
when he sees hlm.

530
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:15,780
Billy boy, you're shooting is ended.

531
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:25,463
Well now Billy, are you haonv
to see us agaln?

532
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,228
Pa has been expecting vou.

533
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:34,172
And won't he be awful glad to know
you're safe with us once again.

534
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:39,142
This other one, wnat are we gonna do
with him? He <i>s</i> dead weight.

535
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:42,484
Pa would say, do you pray son?

536
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,848
Confess pure, you die absolved.

537
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:33,426
Mount up!

538
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:36,762
But hold it! I hardly even know him!

539
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:42,477
He's your amigo, yeah? See what you
brought upon your friend, Billy?

540
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,207
Sure glad I ain't your friend.

541
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:46,837
Get moving.

542
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:30,353
Tell me, will you? Are you scared?

543
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:32,860
No, I feel cold!

544
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:43,238
Such a pilty. If we'd made it out to that
ranch, I d have given in to you anyway.

545
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:44,529
I don't get it.

546
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:47,240
The turkeys...

547
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:51,871
You're just tel I ilng me that
because you know you re going to...

548
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:56,014
Uh uh, no, vou could have had them.

549
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:04,952
Guess I 'm unlucky...

550
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:29,415
Why not that bastard?

551
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:36,591
Only six bullets. One up there,
and the rest down here.

552
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:58,042
How come Tim? You've began lying.
You told me you couldn t shoot.

553
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,479
I can shoot, just don't like to.

554
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:08,714
I'm not able to use my hands. I prefer
to use my wits. Take it easy there!

555
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:10,391
Big liar!

556
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:15,291
Listen to me, Harry,
l m really able to shoot,

557
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,731
 but if I do,
they ll know who I am. Look.

558
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:27,572
Who are you then?

559
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:31,241
My name is Billy Boyd.

560
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,417
In Virginia

561
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:43,923
I worked for Samuel Pratt.

562
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:49,888
One day I decided to make a change,
make a new start.

563
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:56,404
Ha, he's really mad, believe me!
Just imagine what he tried to do?

564
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:57,928
To hunt you down.

565
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:04,175
Yeah. He even sent two of his sons.
They both missed.

566
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:05,338
Then you left?

567
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:08,882
Yeah, after putting two shots
in the middle of their foreheads.

568
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:37,274
It's about ready, Harry.

569
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:41,975
If the lord provides abundance,
why should man have to toll?

570
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:47,147
My pa always said man was born to toil.
Then I think he was nght.

571
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,616
My father almost never spoke.

572
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:55,657
He rarely spoke to me.
My father would say...

573
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:57,928
What's that?

574
01:03:58,034 --> 01:03:59,729
Mourning.

575
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:05,200
Pretty soon let's make our way
out to our ranch.

576
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:06,536
Hold on! It's my own!

577
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,071
What do you mean, the whole place?

578
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:10,669
We'll see, but let's get there first.

579
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:13,214
Ah, we'll get there, don't worry,

580
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:17,014
and I'll start right away
building the turkey coops.

581
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:19,544
I told you, no turkeys!

582
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:21,254
Hey wait, you already promised.

583
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:26,553
Eh, a promise qin't worth a gold urn
when you re ready to go.

584
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:29,696
Why, you stinking bastard!

585
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:36,896
I thought I told you never
to call me by that word!

586
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:39,701
But when was the time
before this that I cursed you?

587
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:42,040
Eh? Oh, excuse me!

588
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:23,684
Where is that coach headed?

589
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:27,420
It takes the gold from the mine
in San Juan to Laredo.

590
01:05:32,628 --> 01:05:33,617
Something to drink!

591
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:52,310
A wagon full of gold.

592
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:55,479
It sure makes you feel itchy.

593
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:58,078
What?

594
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:00,822
I mean that wagon.

595
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:04,458
Better just forget it.
Let me tell you:

596
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,256
Brent Beauregard wanted
that gold too,

597
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:11,724
and when he couldn't get it,
poor Brent was fit to be done.

598
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:14,501
Who is Brent Beauregard?

599
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:16,393
There he is.

600
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:22,770
Mlight take him with us.
We d have a better chance.

601
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:28,239
Who can tell?
We could ask him to go along.

602
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:34,754
No, no pal, I've made up my mind.

603
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:42,320
And please, don't mix
with men who are already fuzzy-headed.

604
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:50,432
You really think it would be so easy?

605
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:51,528
What's that?

606
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,475
Getting our hands on that gold.

607
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:59,106
Alright: Now, what distinguishes
the coaches of Wells Fargo?

608
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:00,682
Why...

609
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:02,248
A sign,

610
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:05,916
and if you put this sign
on the side of your own carrlage...

611
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:10,857
and beat theirs to the mine by leaving
just as it's morning, then you get?

612
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,052
About two hours sleep!

613
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:13,225
You get the gold!

614
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:17,766
And you needn't bother to shoot anyone.

615
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:21,902
Always use your wits.

616
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:25,936
Ain't you even tempted?

617
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:28,139
N0, siree.

618
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:51,092
Remarkable. I've never hea[d of
anything as clever as thls.

619
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:52,864
Man, you really have quite a head.

620
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:56,503
Hm, I guess so. Perhaps, I don't know.

621
01:07:56,972 --> 01:07:59,065
You really do. More than I figured.

622
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:04,169
Keep this in mind

623
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:08,374
then: You're better off using this.
Know what I mean?

624
01:10:01,964 --> 01:10:02,988
Didn't I tell you?
Just like I sald.

625
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:04,725
Nice and easy.

626
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:05,824
You were right.

627
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:14,967
Who are they?

628
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:15,873
The military escort.

629
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:17,907
Are they coming with us?

630
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,980
We'll find out.

631
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:21,849
We got the gold,
don't be worried about it.

632
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:25,216
We'll just have to move fast.
Put a smile on your face.

633
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:27,820
Whoa! Whoa!

634
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:31,683
You're new on the job, aren't you?

635
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:34,187
It's our maiden voyage, lieutenant.

636
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:42,600
Let's go!

637
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:32,686
I'm gonna, get off and maybe... walk a
while. I'm can make it back alnght.

638
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:35,916
No! No, you won't.
We're in this together now, get on!

639
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:38,953
Nobody told me it would
turn out this way!

640
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:41,495
Take it easy, amigo.
You Just let me handle this.

641
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:47,066
Don't shoot them, no!

642
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:05,844
Come on, a little closer...

643
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:32,006
Now what wi ll you do?

644
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:34,440
Stop, I say!

645
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:40,912
You're crazy, you know that?!

646
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:43,214
I told you: no shooting,
and you did it anyway!

647
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:50,960
You shot a military escort!

648
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,100
You know what's gonna happen? They're
gonna catch us and sting us up!

649
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:56,394
Then how are we gonna spend the gold?

650
01:12:58,974 --> 01:13:01,807
Thanks for everything,
you real Iv had some great ldeas.

651
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:06,744
Adios, amigo.

652
01:13:43,152 --> 01:13:44,881
Just what the hell have you been doing,
Harry? Let's go!

653
01:13:48,023 --> 01:13:50,457
But the gold! It's all there! Wait!

654
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:53,153
Yeah? Then look over that way...

655
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,062
We'd better get out of here!

656
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:22,346
Brent Beauregard, he's been after this
for years. He can stop tryrng now.

657
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:25,518
It's all here. Looks like
the other one got away.

658
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:51,909
So you inherited a big ranch, did you?

659
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:54,752
It's gonna take
a lot of work, I would imagine.

660
01:14:57,926 --> 01:15:01,953
Discouraged? Let's take a peek inside.
I think it's got possibilines.

661
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:48,508
Come on in! Just think, this all
belongs to us. Dirt, bugs and all.

662
01:15:49,011 --> 01:15:53,812
The only thing your uncle forgot is
where there is a big stick of dynamite.

663
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:56,873
Well,

664
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:58,177
might as well get at it.

665
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,517
This time next yea[ we'll have the most
beautlful ranch ln thls whole area!

666
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:06,118
Fields of wheat
Just waving in the wind.

667
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,757
Wheat? Where is it?

668
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:10,456
We'll have to raise it!

669
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:18,224
I want you all to meet my daddy,
Samuel Pratt!

670
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:54,165
There they are!

671
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:55,668
Better have a word with them.

672
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:15,148
Get them!

673
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:25,190
Ah, let me go! take your hands of me!

674
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:27,796
Hey, Roger, they're gone!

675
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:28,665
Where are they?

676
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:29,694
Let me go!

677
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:33,939
Where have they gone?

678
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:37,037
Hold it!

679
01:18:37,913 --> 01:18:39,073
Women are more talkative!

680
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:45,049
Bring her to me here.

681
01:18:45,153 --> 01:18:46,643
Let me go!

682
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:49,748
Come on, sister.

683
01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:54,020
Hand the little wildcat over to me!

684
01:19:07,209 --> 01:19:08,506
I wanna know where those other two are.
Tell me now.

685
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:10,077
I don't know what you're talking about!

686
01:19:10,345 --> 01:19:12,142
Now don't you get smart with me, miss.

687
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:15,178
What do you want?
What are you gonna do to me?

688
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:25,226
You get away from me!
There <i>s</i> nothing to tell!

689
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:28,053
Like your back scratched, mermaid?

690
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:31,098
You've got to believe me!
I can t tell you anythlng!

691
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:34,393
Listen to this, mermaid:
I mean busmess...

692
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:37,704
Ah! Oh!

693
01:19:37,973 --> 01:19:40,168
Your pa seems to be having a sweet time.

694
01:19:40,575 --> 01:19:42,907
No! No! Ah!

695
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:46,778
Yeah, he always was a lady-killer.

696
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:51,083
I heard... Jubilee Creek, a ranch, ah!

697
01:19:53,388 --> 01:19:56,448
Yeah. That's what
I call cooperation.

698
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:55,775
Hey, that fox has sprung the trap again.

699
01:20:58,286 --> 01:21:00,447
Must be something wrong with the bait.

700
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:04,317
Don't worrry. Sooner or later,
we'll catch him.

701
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:08,628
Now the roof is fixed!

702
01:21:08,964 --> 01:21:11,296
It will hold a bull now!

703
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:19,196
That a bull! Just keen at it.

704
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:34,913
I'll take one of those.

705
01:21:49,371 --> 01:21:50,429
Will that do it?

706
01:21:54,809 --> 01:21:56,800
Well, l'll take one of those oil cans.

707
01:22:06,788 --> 01:22:09,450
All together it's 20 dollars and 50 cents.

708
01:22:17,465 --> 01:22:18,932
Yes. We're a little
short now. You recall

709
01:22:19,034 --> 01:22:22,902
those twenty dollars worth of goods
we took the other day out to the ranch?

710
01:22:25,173 --> 01:22:26,800
You'll put it on the book, yes?

711
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:28,803
Everybody does...

712
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:33,837
Thanks. Could you come out
and see me at the ranch?

713
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:35,574
I hope you got everything, Tim.

714
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:37,475
What do you think of this,
Mrs. Miller, you want it?

715
01:22:37,552 --> 01:22:38,610
I'll try it.

716
01:22:38,753 --> 01:22:40,550
Thank you. Morning!

717
01:23:41,282 --> 01:23:42,943
With this one we've got six.

718
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:46,053
Perhaps wg're gonna have ourselves
a llttle house-party!

719
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:50,884

Get in there!

730
01:26:53,474 --> 01:26:54,702
Light it!

731
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:56,299

732
01:27:20,768 --> 01:27:21,666
- Where are you going?
- The turkeys!

733
01:27:21,769 --> 01:27:23,168
Leave them where they are!

734
01:27:48,129 --> 01:27:49,892
Up with your hands, Billy.

735
01:28:10,184 --> 01:28:12,311
It's your turn now, Billy...

736
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:15,649
I'm not gonna kill you vet.

737

Your're gonna suffer first
I wanna see you beg to die!

738
01:28:27,402 --> 01:28:28,596
Have a little fun with him.

Yeah... Dron your holster, Billy!

740
01:28:40,348 --> 01:28:41,474
Eh,

741
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:43,614
Watch him, Roger.

742
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:46,211
If he drops his hands,
you're a dead man.

743
01:28:53,094 --> 01:28:55,585
Uh-huh, you ought to listen
to your pa there, Roger.

744
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:58,058
If you wanna take it, come on.

745
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:28,946
Didn't I tell you we'd catch
that fox one of these days?

746
01:30:49,410 --> 01:30:50,570
Yeah, that's it...

747
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:02,521
lt's alright, you'll just
bulld another beside it.

748
01:31:04,058 --> 01:31:06,492
What do you mean, boy? Alone?

749
01:31:11,065 --> 01:31:15,661
Yeah. Alone. It's better I go.

750
01:31:17,505 --> 01:31:18,494
You'll make it.

751
01:31:20,341 --> 01:31:22,241
It's better we go our own ways.

752
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:28,637
Tim!

753
01:31:42,697 --> 01:31:43,686
Billy!

754
01:31:57,311 --> 01:31:58,437
Where are you going? Very far?

755
01:32:04,986 --> 01:32:06,112
I'll send you a letter!

756
01:32:08,856 --> 01:32:09,880
