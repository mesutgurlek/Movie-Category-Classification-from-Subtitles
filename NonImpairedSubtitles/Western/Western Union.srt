1
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:46,584
We've lost him. You, men, head south.
We'll take the stage-coach trail.

2
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,489
What's the matter with you, Spider?

3
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,690
Whoa, boy.

4
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,678
Well, Spider, old boy.

5
00:02:51,217 --> 00:02:53,742
I hate to part company but...

6
00:02:53,986 --> 00:02:56,580
it's you or me.

7
00:03:43,035 --> 00:03:45,003
Howdy, stranger.

8
00:03:47,073 --> 00:03:50,042
Sorry, but I'm gonna have to borrow
your horse for a spell.

9
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:55,012
I reckon I'd better
borrow your gun, too.

10
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,971
Where does it hurt most?

11
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:32,048
My ankle.

12
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:34,276
Here and here.

13
00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:38,921
Busted rib. Somebody put
the boot to you, huh?

14
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:40,783
Horse fell on me.

15
00:04:40,993 --> 00:04:42,460
Take it easy.

16
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:51,931
Sit down.
Let's roll up your shirt.

17
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:02,070
Raise your hands over your head.

18
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:16,352
Feel better?

19
00:05:16,562 --> 00:05:18,792
Much. Thanks.

20
00:05:28,574 --> 00:05:30,201
Let's get outta here.

21
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,630
Well, why don't you say
what you're thinking?

22
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:55,067
I'm not thinking anything.

23
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:10,610
Come on.

24
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:23,586
Take a chew of this. It'll help
you keep your mind off the pain.

25
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,460
Thanks.

26
00:06:30,836 --> 00:06:32,861
Come on.

27
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,778
Me, a Santa Claus.

28
00:06:40,046 --> 00:06:43,209
-What's that?
-Nothing, nothing at all.

29
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:06,295
This is the stage depot.
They'll take care of you.

30
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:15,613
I'll still need your horse.

31
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:17,715
You're welcome to it,
and anything else I have.

32
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:20,010
Forget it.

33
00:07:26,892 --> 00:07:29,452
What's going on here?

34
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:43,302
Don't look like one of them,
does he?

35
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:45,773
I never seen this fellow before.

36
00:07:50,483 --> 00:07:53,111
-What do you want?
-What's your name, stranger?

37
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:57,318
-Edward Creighton.
-What you doing here?

38
00:07:57,523 --> 00:07:59,548
-Surveyor.
-Surveyor?

39
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,989
Yes, I work for Western Union.

40
00:08:02,194 --> 00:08:05,561
-What's Western Union?
-A telegraph company.

41
00:08:05,765 --> 00:08:08,290
We're going through here next year
on our way to the coast.

42
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:10,662
I guess he's all right.

43
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,359
Anything wrong?

44
00:08:12,571 --> 00:08:14,004
We had a bank holdup
at North Platte today.

45
00:08:14,206 --> 00:08:16,401
We killed one of them
and the rest of them scattered.

46
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:19,669
Looks like we've lost them,
now for good.

47
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:40,129
-She's here, Mr. Creighton.
-Oh, good.

48
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:42,095
Are you ready?

49
00:08:42,635 --> 00:08:44,500
I think so, Bert.

50
00:08:44,703 --> 00:08:49,037
Now if I can just manage to
navigate on these things, Bert.

51
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:52,301
I reckon you'll be back this way
with that telegraph line before long.

52
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:54,706
If everything goes right, I will.

53
00:08:54,914 --> 00:08:57,815
I do a little trapping now and then
so I was wondering...

54
00:08:58,017 --> 00:09:01,612
how much it would cost to send
my pelts into Omaha by telegraph.

55
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:03,982
You can't send pelts by telegraph,
Bert.

56
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,091
-You can't?
-No. All you can send is writing.

57
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:10,262
Then the telegraph
ain't gonna do me any good.

58
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:11,891
Bert...

59
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:15,329
I can't repay you for your kindness,
but...

60
00:09:15,534 --> 00:09:18,503
...this may help a little.
-Thanks.

61
00:09:19,004 --> 00:09:21,165
Folding money!

62
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:23,266
Can you manage
all those things yourself?

63
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:25,467
Oh, yes, Sir.

64
00:09:25,811 --> 00:09:28,541
Better let me take that, too.

65
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:41,017
Woody.

66
00:09:42,428 --> 00:09:45,795
Woody, I want you to have this
along with my thanks.

67
00:09:45,998 --> 00:09:48,523
Gosh, Mr. Creighton, thanks.

68
00:09:53,405 --> 00:09:54,804
Goodbye, boys.
I'll see you next year.

69
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:57,703
-Get up!
-So long, Mr. Creighton.

70
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:04,880
-Nice fellow.
-Yes, Siree.

71
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:07,814
You don't believe what he said about
that telegraph coming through here...

72
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,715
...do you?
-Of course not.

73
00:10:09,922 --> 00:10:12,356
There ain't no such thing
as a telegraph no how.

74
00:10:12,558 --> 00:10:14,458
But he's a right nice fellow,
just the same.

75
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,719
He sure is. Look what he give me.

76
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:18,988
-His watch and chain!
-Yes.

77
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:21,462
What does a fellow
that goes to bed at sundown...

78
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,828
and gets up at sunup
want with a watch?

79
00:10:24,036 --> 00:10:26,732
Well, it's a mighty pretty thing
to wear.

80
00:10:27,973 --> 00:10:30,203
Sounds nice, too.

81
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:31,971
Yes.

82
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:38,143
Across the plains the pay
for drivers, diggers...

83
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:40,676
pole men and timber cutters
is two dollars a day.

84
00:11:41,146 --> 00:11:43,376
And when we hit the Indian country,
it's three dollars....

85
00:11:43,582 --> 00:11:46,608
and every man supplies
his own gun. O.K?

86
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:48,252
What do you mean O.K?

87
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:52,083
That's telegraph talk.
Means all right.

88
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:56,125
If the Doc here passes you,
you buckos have got yourself a job.

89
00:11:59,265 --> 00:12:00,664
You'll do.

90
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,138
You'll do. Stand up, son.

91
00:12:11,477 --> 00:12:14,002
-Nice withers.
-I ain't no horse.

92
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:16,681
You'll wish you were
before you're through.

93
00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:23,277
Feels like you got
a slug of lead there, partner.

94
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:25,184
-Forty-four?
-Indian arrowhead.

95
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:27,120
It don't bother me none.

96
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:29,851
Some members of the medical
profession like to cut them out...

97
00:12:30,062 --> 00:12:32,292
but I say let them stay
if they're that comfortable.

98
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:33,988
You know this country
we're going into?

99
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:37,566
Weren't a hundred miles from here
I lost this hair back in fifty-six.

100
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,529
A neat bit of surgery that.

101
00:12:46,178 --> 00:12:48,169
What's ailing you?

102
00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:51,206
Did he say a hundred miles
from here?

103
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:53,009
That was five years ago.

104
00:12:53,218 --> 00:12:56,051
Nowadays we don't see no Indians
this side of Cottonwood Springs.

105
00:12:56,255 --> 00:12:59,315
Then you and me start drawing down
an extra dollar, eh?

106
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:01,549
Speak for yourself, stranger.

107
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,251
When I get back to St. Joe,
I figure on keeping my hair...

108
00:13:04,463 --> 00:13:06,761
instead of telling the folks
how I lost it.

109
00:13:06,965 --> 00:13:08,990
Indians don't always
scalp a fellow.

110
00:13:09,201 --> 00:13:11,533
Not if the fellow
scalps them first.

111
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,807
This ain't for me.

112
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:19,068
I've got to have peace and quiet
when I'm preparing my victuals.

113
00:13:19,878 --> 00:13:22,108
-Are you a cook?
-For twenty years...

114
00:13:22,314 --> 00:13:25,579
with the same head of hair.
And I intend to be for twenty more.

115
00:13:25,784 --> 00:13:28,275
-Gents, I bid you good day.
-Hold him, Doc!

116
00:13:28,487 --> 00:13:30,079
-Doctor Murdoch!
-Yeah?

117
00:13:31,957 --> 00:13:33,686
Mr. Creighton says
he don't need these no more.

118
00:13:33,892 --> 00:13:34,950
Put them down.
Go down to the cook-house...

119
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,459
and tell that good-for-nothing
poisoner he's fired.

120
00:13:39,231 --> 00:13:41,426
Can you cook lamb?

121
00:13:49,575 --> 00:13:53,773
There are nine different ways
to cook mutton and I know them all.

122
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:58,040
-Boiled, stewed, fricasseed.
-Never mind that.

123
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,775
Do you cook it
with the hair on it?

124
00:14:01,186 --> 00:14:03,746
-I should say not.
-Hurray!

125
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:05,218
-Then you're hired.
-No, no!

126
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:06,982
And your job is to see
that he stays hired.

127
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:09,717
Remind me to show you an old
Indian way to cook prairie dog.

128
00:14:09,928 --> 00:14:12,863
Oh, no. I should
have stayed in St. Joe.

129
00:14:13,932 --> 00:14:16,662
-Hello, Mr. Creighton.
-Oh, hello, Bert.

130
00:14:20,906 --> 00:14:23,374
-Where's Miss Creighton, Pat?
-She's, over at the corral, Sir.

131
00:14:23,575 --> 00:14:26,373
We're buying some new horses today.

132
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:29,074
How many have we, Bert?

133
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,914
Who's that with my sister, Pat?

134
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,756
The fellow I hired to do scouting
and take charge of the livestock.

135
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,483
-Hello Sue.
-Edward, darling!

136
00:14:42,694 --> 00:14:45,857
Don't tell me you've given up
telegraphy for a corral?

137
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:50,863
Edward, I'm so glad you're back.

138
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,867
What's the doctor
in Washington say?

139
00:14:57,075 --> 00:14:58,406
Why, he says I'm fit as a fiddle.

140
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,701
I could walk from here to Salt Lake
on my hands if I had to.

141
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:02,403
I'm so glad.

142
00:15:02,614 --> 00:15:03,979
Shaw, this is Mr. Creighton,
the big boss...

143
00:15:04,183 --> 00:15:07,050
the only man around here you
have to be polite to.

144
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,913
I'm glad to know you, Shaw.

145
00:15:10,556 --> 00:15:12,456
You've got to take a lot of horses
and cattle a long way.

146
00:15:12,658 --> 00:15:14,888
-Do you think you can manage it?
-I think so.

147
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:16,617
Good.

148
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:18,922
Come on, sis. You're supposed to be
a telegrapher, you know.

149
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:22,294
-Goodbye, Mr. Shaw.
-Goodbye, ma'am.

150
00:15:57,803 --> 00:16:00,328
What's the rush, Shaw?

151
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:03,372
We're not leaving here
for a couple of days.

152
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:05,738
I'm leaving tonight.

153
00:16:05,944 --> 00:16:08,276
-Why?
-You know why.

154
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,914
I like being alone.

155
00:16:11,683 --> 00:16:14,083
The best place to be alone
sometimes is in a crowd.

156
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:16,652
That's the way I figured it,
till I ran into you.

157
00:16:18,857 --> 00:16:20,984
There's a good chance for you
in Western Union.

158
00:16:22,594 --> 00:16:24,391
Is there?

159
00:16:24,596 --> 00:16:26,188
I think so.

160
00:16:26,398 --> 00:16:28,525
It's up to you.

161
00:16:30,335 --> 00:16:32,428
You don't owe me nothing.

162
00:16:33,238 --> 00:16:34,569
How could l?

163
00:16:34,773 --> 00:16:37,139
I never saw you before.

164
00:16:39,912 --> 00:16:42,244
Glad to meet you, Mr. Creighton.

165
00:16:45,017 --> 00:16:46,882
Here.

166
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:49,750
Take a good chew of this.

167
00:16:49,955 --> 00:16:53,584
-Helps keep your mind off things.
-Thanks.

168
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,681
Whoa.

169
00:17:31,797 --> 00:17:33,560
Would you mind holding my horses
for me, old man?

170
00:17:33,765 --> 00:17:35,790
Thank you very much.

171
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:51,440
I'd like to see
Mr. Creighton, please.

172
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,108
-Next office.
-Thank you.

173
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,793
-You spell dude D-U-D-E.
-That's the way l...

174
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,900
No, E's a single dot, like that.

175
00:18:10,102 --> 00:18:13,697
-You put a dash after it, like that.
-I did nothing of the sort.

176
00:18:13,905 --> 00:18:15,964
Besides, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

177
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:20,343
No, but I know
what you're talking about.

178
00:18:20,912 --> 00:18:23,210
Next time let's talk about...

179
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:39,397
Mr. Creighton?

180
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:43,967
-Yes, I'm Creighton.
-Richard Blake, reporting for work, Sir.

181
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:47,070
How do you do, Mr. Blake.
I was expecting you by stage.

182
00:18:47,272 --> 00:18:50,139
The stage was so crowded and bumpy
that I bought a spring wagon...

183
00:18:50,342 --> 00:18:52,367
...and drove the last leg myself.
-Why, yes.

184
00:18:52,577 --> 00:18:54,340
-Much more comfortable that way.
-Quite.

185
00:18:54,546 --> 00:18:57,572
Mr. Blake, I want you to know
Homer Kettle, my assistant.

186
00:18:57,783 --> 00:18:59,751
-This is Pat Grogan, our foreman.
-How do you do, gentlemen?

187
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:01,578
-How're you, sonny?
-Glad to know you, Blake.

188
00:19:01,787 --> 00:19:03,584
The last leg of your trip
must have been rather lonesome.

189
00:19:03,855 --> 00:19:06,187
Well, I didn't mind that as much
as I did the dust.

190
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:07,983
I could do with a bath.

191
00:19:08,193 --> 00:19:09,990
A bath?

192
00:19:10,195 --> 00:19:11,492
Yes. Don't you approve of them?

193
00:19:11,697 --> 00:19:13,927
Well, if the weather's hot and
you're near a river.

194
00:19:14,132 --> 00:19:16,600
I ain't got a thing again them.

195
00:19:16,802 --> 00:19:20,568
What type of work would you prefer
to be assigned to, Mr. Blake?

196
00:19:20,772 --> 00:19:22,797
Why, anything at all.

197
00:19:23,008 --> 00:19:24,566
I had some engineering
at Harvard...

198
00:19:24,776 --> 00:19:26,573
and I know the Morse Code
inside out.

199
00:19:26,778 --> 00:19:28,803
I think we can
figure out something.

200
00:19:29,014 --> 00:19:31,881
For the present, why don't you run
on over to the hotel and...

201
00:19:32,084 --> 00:19:34,018
take your bath
and we'll have a little talk later.

202
00:19:34,219 --> 00:19:36,585
Thank you very much.
Good day, gentlemen.

203
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:39,916
...and you, too.
-Well, the...

204
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,854
Aw!

205
00:19:43,528 --> 00:19:46,224
-Oh, Mr. Blake.
-Yes?

206
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,294
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry?

207
00:19:50,502 --> 00:19:53,164
-Because I understand Morse Code?
-Yes.

208
00:19:53,371 --> 00:19:55,168
No, I mean l...

209
00:19:55,373 --> 00:19:57,136
You'll have to excuse me.
I have work to do.

210
00:19:57,342 --> 00:19:59,139
Well, anyway, I'm happy
to have met you, Miss Creighton.

211
00:19:59,344 --> 00:20:01,642
You are the big boss sister,
aren't you?

212
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,439
-Yes, but how'd you know?
-How did I know?

213
00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:06,913
You both have that intense look.

214
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,917
Does the great Western outdoors
do that to you?

215
00:20:10,522 --> 00:20:12,888
No, it's people we meet
from the East.

216
00:20:13,091 --> 00:20:15,616
Some people you meet are going
to insist on meeting you again.

217
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:17,556
So I won't say goodbye now.

218
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:23,863
Whoa, there. Whoa.

219
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:26,003
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

220
00:20:26,204 --> 00:20:27,296
There, see?

221
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:29,804
Thank you very much. By the way,
could you direct me to the hotel?

222
00:20:30,008 --> 00:20:31,168
It's on Main Street.

223
00:20:31,376 --> 00:20:33,003
Take your first turning to the right
and go down two streets.

224
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:34,974
Thank you very much.

225
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,047
Just a minute, young man.

226
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:39,012
-Do you know who I am?
-I haven't the faintest idea.

227
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:41,742
I'm the Provisional Governor
of the Territory of Nebraska.

228
00:20:41,987 --> 00:20:44,717
You are? When you come up
for reelection I'll vote for you.

229
00:20:44,923 --> 00:20:46,254
You don't vote
for a provisional Governor.

230
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,823
He's appointed by the president.

231
00:20:48,026 --> 00:20:50,392
The next time I'm in Washington,
I'll put in a good word for you.

232
00:20:50,595 --> 00:20:52,358
Watch out!

233
00:20:54,366 --> 00:20:58,393
Would you mind telling me what that
was that just passed through here?

234
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:00,935
That is the son
of tough old Arad Blake...

235
00:21:01,139 --> 00:21:03,130
who made a fortune hauling freight
through the Cumberland Gap...

236
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:05,502
...in the 30s.
-Arad Blake!

237
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:07,506
-That?
-Yes.

238
00:21:07,712 --> 00:21:10,476
His father thinks a job with Western
Union'll make a man out of him.

239
00:21:10,682 --> 00:21:12,240
Make a man.

240
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,715
When I was back East, Arad gave me
fifty thousand dollars for the line.

241
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:19,322
I see. You got
the son with the money.

242
00:21:33,972 --> 00:21:36,600
Good heavens.
Do you see what I see?

243
00:21:50,722 --> 00:21:55,455
Well, here I am.
All ready for work.

244
00:21:55,727 --> 00:21:57,922
So I see.
Where'd you get that outfit?

245
00:21:58,129 --> 00:22:00,222
-In town?
-Oh, no, New York.

246
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:02,229
I wanted to be sure of the fit.

247
00:22:02,434 --> 00:22:05,665
-Not bad, huh?
-Blake, this is Shaw, our scout.

248
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:07,634
-How do you do?
-Howdy.

249
00:22:08,406 --> 00:22:10,840
Well, a nice looking bunch of
horses you have here.

250
00:22:11,643 --> 00:22:12,632
Glad you like them.

251
00:22:12,844 --> 00:22:15,642
-Do you ride?
-Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.

252
00:22:16,581 --> 00:22:20,677
Them ain't livery stable animals.
Some of them are pretty wild.

253
00:22:23,388 --> 00:22:25,015
Well, that's the way I like them.

254
00:22:25,223 --> 00:22:27,657
Would you mind
picking out one for me?

255
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,751
I'd be delighted.

256
00:22:31,863 --> 00:22:33,797
Take that black one over there.

257
00:22:34,499 --> 00:22:37,024
-This way, please.
-Excuse-me.

258
00:22:40,939 --> 00:22:44,033
Somebody better call Doc Murdoch.

259
00:23:13,438 --> 00:23:15,565
He don't mean it!
He's just fooling!

260
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:29,786
Go on! Stay with him!

261
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,581
Whoa! Whoa!
Steady, steady boy!

262
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:02,284
Whoa!

263
00:24:11,863 --> 00:24:14,195
Steady.
Steady, boy.

264
00:24:14,399 --> 00:24:17,027
Yeah. Nice animal, gentlemen.

265
00:24:17,235 --> 00:24:19,760
You haven't anything else
you'd like me to try?

266
00:24:20,872 --> 00:24:21,998
No.

267
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:25,409
A little present for you, Homer.

268
00:24:26,444 --> 00:24:29,743
-He's quite a talker, ain't he?
-Quite a rider, too.

269
00:24:49,634 --> 00:24:51,761
-Hello, Mr. Blake.
-Hello.

270
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:55,133
-My brother isn't in right now.
-That's good.

271
00:24:56,107 --> 00:24:59,235
-Won't you have a chair?
-Thank you.

272
00:25:04,949 --> 00:25:07,417
Evening, Mr. Blake.

273
00:25:08,286 --> 00:25:10,049
Hello.

274
00:25:10,655 --> 00:25:13,453
Well, I guess
I'd better be running along.

275
00:25:13,658 --> 00:25:15,216
So soon?

276
00:25:15,427 --> 00:25:18,453
Well, I just thought I'd wish you
a happy Fourth of July.

277
00:25:18,663 --> 00:25:19,925
But that's tomorrow.

278
00:25:20,131 --> 00:25:23,931
Well, I thought I'd be the first,
but I see I wasn't.

279
00:25:24,135 --> 00:25:27,127
Was that what you came for, too,
Mr. Shaw?

280
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:29,101
Uh huh.

281
00:25:29,307 --> 00:25:32,572
Well, I reckon I'd better
be going along, too.

282
00:25:33,044 --> 00:25:37,913
Good night... both of you.
Thanks for dropping by.

283
00:25:38,116 --> 00:25:40,277
Good night.

284
00:25:42,454 --> 00:25:45,116
-Adiós.
-Good night.

285
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,531
I didn't have a chance
to tell you before...

286
00:25:55,733 --> 00:25:57,963
but you did all right today
on that bucking horse.

287
00:25:58,169 --> 00:25:59,329
That wasn't so bad.

288
00:25:59,537 --> 00:26:01,061
They gave you the worst critter
in the lot.

289
00:26:01,272 --> 00:26:03,536
You always do that with every
tenderfoot, don't you?

290
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:05,436
Depends on the tenderfoot.

291
00:26:05,643 --> 00:26:07,008
Well, I'm sorry I disappointed
all of you...

292
00:26:07,212 --> 00:26:10,147
but I was riding horses
before I could walk.

293
00:26:47,218 --> 00:26:49,516
-Good night.
-Good night.

294
00:26:49,754 --> 00:26:52,746
You going my way?

295
00:26:59,164 --> 00:27:03,066
A transcontinental telegraph line...

296
00:27:03,268 --> 00:27:06,760
has long been the dream
of Americans.

297
00:27:07,305 --> 00:27:11,503
Now it is to become a reality.

298
00:27:11,743 --> 00:27:16,544
A great reality
that will eventually...

299
00:27:16,748 --> 00:27:21,344
triumph over hardship
and privation.

300
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,548
It now gives me great pleasure...

301
00:27:25,757 --> 00:27:28,749
to present the chief Engineer
of Western Union...

302
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,224
Mr. Edward Creighton.

303
00:27:34,866 --> 00:27:37,198
Hurray!

304
00:27:41,306 --> 00:27:44,241
I've just received a message
here, which...

305
00:27:44,442 --> 00:27:49,641
better than any words of mine, will
explain the urgency of our task.

306
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:53,415
"Allow me to wish you Godspeed
on a journey...

307
00:27:53,618 --> 00:27:57,884
that will do much to help this Union
in its hour of greatest need.

308
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:00,080
It is imperative
that our Government...

309
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:03,089
have quick communication
with the West."

310
00:28:04,195 --> 00:28:07,289
The message is signed
"Abraham Lincoln".

311
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,535
Let her go, boys.

312
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:16,624
You're happy, aren't you?

313
00:30:17,161 --> 00:30:19,595
Every man is when his dream
begins to materialize.

314
00:30:19,797 --> 00:30:21,628
I know.

315
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:24,529
It's things like this that make some
women wish they'd been born men.

316
00:30:24,736 --> 00:30:27,000
Well, don't forget
you've got a job to do, too.

317
00:30:27,205 --> 00:30:30,572
-Goodbye, Sue.
-Goodbye, Edward. God bless you.

318
00:30:36,781 --> 00:30:39,443
Something tells me I'm going
to miss dear old Omaha.

319
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,618
Me, too.

320
00:30:44,689 --> 00:30:46,884
I hate to say it, Miss Creighton,
but I'm afraid this is goodbye.

321
00:30:47,091 --> 00:30:48,319
Goodbye, Mr. Blake.

322
00:30:48,526 --> 00:30:49,754
You'll take care of my brother,
won't you?

323
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:51,087
I'll do my best, ma'am.

324
00:30:51,295 --> 00:30:52,819
Don't you want him to take care
of me, too?

325
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,429
I'll do that, too.

326
00:30:54,632 --> 00:30:57,192
-Adiós, Miss Creighton.
-Goodbye!

327
00:31:10,782 --> 00:31:16,414
<i>I'm leaving Cheyenne</i>
<i>I'm off the mountain</i>

328
00:31:18,623 --> 00:31:23,993
<i>Goodbye, old Paint</i>
<i>I'm leaving Cheyenne</i>

329
00:31:24,195 --> 00:31:26,425
<i>Goodbye, old Paint</i>

330
00:31:26,631 --> 00:31:28,258
Hey!

331
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:30,161
Hey!

332
00:31:31,068 --> 00:31:34,003
Stop that hollering
and watch where you're going.

333
00:31:34,605 --> 00:31:38,632
Five miles from Omaha
and I'm a cripple already.

334
00:31:50,855 --> 00:31:52,254
Come on there.

335
00:31:55,693 --> 00:31:58,628
Men, we're doing fine.
Eleven miles in two days...

336
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,525
but we've got to do better.

337
00:32:00,865 --> 00:32:04,892
This is prairie country. We've got
to make every minute count because...

338
00:32:05,102 --> 00:32:08,071
soon we're gonna hit the hills and
we're liable to run into trouble.

339
00:32:08,573 --> 00:32:10,871
Now that's all. Let's turn in now
and get a good night's sleep.

340
00:32:11,075 --> 00:32:14,238
Tomorrow we'll get at it again,
bright and early.

341
00:32:25,756 --> 00:32:27,656
Steady.

342
00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:40,428
Steady.

343
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:16,633
-Hello, Mr. Shaw.
-Evening, Miss Creighton.

344
00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:21,476
Well, I didn't expect to see you.
Is there anything wrong?

345
00:33:22,146 --> 00:33:25,206
No, nothing wrong.
We're just a few miles out...

346
00:33:25,416 --> 00:33:29,352
...so I sort of thought that...
-Good.

347
00:33:30,955 --> 00:33:33,617
-Sit down.
-Thanks.

348
00:33:33,824 --> 00:33:38,158
You see, I had some unfinished
business here and l...

349
00:33:40,064 --> 00:33:41,895
Good evening, Mr. Shaw.

350
00:33:42,099 --> 00:33:44,533
I had some
unfinished business, too.

351
00:33:44,735 --> 00:33:46,930
Hello.

352
00:33:55,546 --> 00:33:59,004
Well, at least you two'll have
company on your ride back.

353
00:34:17,134 --> 00:34:19,432
Get Doc Murdoch, quick!

354
00:34:22,773 --> 00:34:26,265
-Is he hurt bad?
-He's pretty badly hurt.

355
00:34:29,113 --> 00:34:31,673
Herb! What happened?

356
00:34:31,882 --> 00:34:35,010
Indians got the cattle.

357
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:38,552
-We did the best we could.
-Sure you did. Where's Frank?

358
00:34:38,756 --> 00:34:41,691
They killed him.

359
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,354
Here's where you and me
start getting that extra dollar.

360
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:04,971
Bullet went
right through you, Herb.

361
00:35:05,182 --> 00:35:07,673
Hadn't ought to be no trouble
at all.

362
00:35:07,985 --> 00:35:10,920
Let's get him to my tent, boys.
I'll have more light to work by.

363
00:35:11,122 --> 00:35:14,182
Come on, grab hold, Cooky.
He won't kick you.

364
00:35:23,801 --> 00:35:25,792
Too bad.
Herb was a real nice fellow.

365
00:35:26,003 --> 00:35:27,766
-He isn't dead yet.
-No, but I got a week's wages'...

366
00:35:27,972 --> 00:35:30,497
...says he will be before morning.
-I'll take that bet.

367
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:32,471
Right.

368
00:35:37,948 --> 00:35:40,439
-Pat, did they get all the cattle?
-That's what they say, Sir.

369
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:42,881
I can't figure this out.
This is Pawnee country...

370
00:35:43,087 --> 00:35:45,715
and Pawnees don't go after cattle
when there's plenty of buffalo.

371
00:35:45,923 --> 00:35:49,154
-Well, do you think it was rustlers?
-Don't know. I'll go have a look.

372
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,952
-How many men do you want?
-None.

373
00:35:51,796 --> 00:35:54,026
You don't expect to bring back
the cattle alone, do you?

374
00:35:55,132 --> 00:35:56,861
I don't expect to get
an Indian war started either.

375
00:35:57,435 --> 00:36:00,131
First thing we gotta find out is what
sort of game we're sitting in on.

376
00:36:00,337 --> 00:36:02,430
All right.

377
00:36:05,443 --> 00:36:07,035
-Double the guard tonight, Pat.
-Yes, Sir.

378
00:36:07,244 --> 00:36:09,678
Come on, Homer.
I want you to call Fort Kearney.

379
00:36:20,958 --> 00:36:22,016
Shaw!

380
00:36:22,226 --> 00:36:24,023
Wait a minute.

381
00:36:24,528 --> 00:36:26,621
-You going after them?
-Yes.

382
00:36:26,831 --> 00:36:28,822
If you don't mind,
I'd like to go with you.

383
00:36:29,033 --> 00:36:31,263
Sorry, but this is one job we don't
trust to a tenderfoot...

384
00:36:31,469 --> 00:36:33,835
no matter how good he is.

385
00:36:44,582 --> 00:36:46,675
How is he, Doc?

386
00:37:00,464 --> 00:37:02,091
Better luck next time, Doc.

387
00:38:05,896 --> 00:38:09,457
Reach and turn around slow.

388
00:38:21,212 --> 00:38:22,611
Vance!

389
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,114
Jack.

390
00:38:27,117 --> 00:38:29,142
-Howdy.
-Hello, Vance.

391
00:38:29,353 --> 00:38:30,342
Howdy.

392
00:38:30,554 --> 00:38:32,249
We knew you'd come back
sooner or later.

393
00:38:32,456 --> 00:38:35,789
Well, we kind of missed you since
that little affair at North Platte.

394
00:38:35,993 --> 00:38:38,757
-Where you been? Missouri?
-No, Omaha.

395
00:38:38,963 --> 00:38:42,763
-Omaha? Wasn't that a little risky?
-Not very much.

396
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:45,595
My face isn't
as well known as yours.

397
00:38:45,803 --> 00:38:48,135
What're you doing out here?

398
00:38:48,505 --> 00:38:50,837
Working for Western Union.

399
00:38:53,377 --> 00:38:55,106
I came to get
those cattle you rustled.

400
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,747
What do you mean, "rustled"?

401
00:38:57,948 --> 00:39:00,382
We're soldiers now,
fighting for the Confederacy.

402
00:39:00,885 --> 00:39:03,353
Them clothes you got on
don't look like no uniforms, to me.

403
00:39:03,554 --> 00:39:06,523
Course not. We're guerillas under
orders from General Moseby.

404
00:39:06,724 --> 00:39:08,851
Did he order you to dress up
like Indians and steal cattle?

405
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:11,186
As far as you're concerned, yes.

406
00:39:11,395 --> 00:39:13,955
These here are my raiders,
just like Moseby's got.

407
00:39:14,331 --> 00:39:16,765
I do whatever I think'll help
the cause along.

408
00:39:16,967 --> 00:39:19,993
You might help the cause by going
down south and joining the army.

409
00:39:20,271 --> 00:39:22,466
You talk like you forgot where you
was born.

410
00:39:22,673 --> 00:39:24,641
You come from Missouri,
same as me.

411
00:39:24,842 --> 00:39:26,207
Are you going against
your own people?

412
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,502
When they turn against
their own country...

413
00:39:27,711 --> 00:39:29,872
...they ain't my people any more.
-Well, they're mine...

414
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:32,579
and they don't want
this Yankee wire strung.

415
00:39:32,783 --> 00:39:34,978
And as long as I'm alive,
it ain't gonna to be.

416
00:39:37,154 --> 00:39:39,247
You wouldn't be making
a little money out of your fighting...

417
00:39:39,456 --> 00:39:42,892
...would you?
-Why, sure, there's money in it.

418
00:39:43,093 --> 00:39:45,994
We sort of combine business
with pleasure, so to speak.

419
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:52,329
I want those cattle, Jack.

420
00:39:53,003 --> 00:39:55,995
You know what you're going to have
to do to get them, don't you?

421
00:40:01,412 --> 00:40:04,279
-You win, for now.
-Wait a minute.

422
00:40:05,282 --> 00:40:07,546
How do I know you won't tell
Creighton about us?

423
00:40:08,919 --> 00:40:10,580
You don't.

424
00:40:10,788 --> 00:40:14,554
-Supposing I don't let you go?
-Why don't you stop me?

425
00:40:18,462 --> 00:40:20,896
Go ahead.

426
00:40:22,833 --> 00:40:24,425
Adiós, Jack.

427
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,607
What do you think he'll do?

428
00:40:31,809 --> 00:40:35,905
What can he do
the way things are?

429
00:40:55,733 --> 00:40:57,394
-Mr. Creighton
-Yes?

430
00:40:57,601 --> 00:40:59,796
Those heathen savages
sure cleaned us out.

431
00:41:00,004 --> 00:41:02,336
What am I gonna tell the men
when they start yelling for dinner?

432
00:41:02,539 --> 00:41:05,440
Herman, tell them we'll get some
more beef just as soon as possible.

433
00:41:05,642 --> 00:41:08,236
That's a mighty indefinite answer
to give to a hungry man.

434
00:41:08,445 --> 00:41:10,743
They'll have to tighten up
their belts for a day or two.

435
00:41:10,948 --> 00:41:12,415
Did you ever try telling that
to a fellow...

436
00:41:12,616 --> 00:41:16,211
after he'd sat down to the table
and tied his napkin around his neck?

437
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,911
I did. Just once.

438
00:41:50,087 --> 00:41:52,555
-Unsaddle and feed him, Joe.
-Want him rubbed down?

439
00:41:52,756 --> 00:41:54,917
I'm gonna do that myself.

440
00:42:04,935 --> 00:42:07,369
-Did you find any traces of them?
-They're up the river twenty miles.

441
00:42:07,571 --> 00:42:09,129
-Indians?
-Yes.

442
00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:12,103
-We'll get some men together and...
-I wouldn't.

443
00:42:12,643 --> 00:42:14,736
They're a bunch of Dakotas
a couple of hundred in the party.

444
00:42:14,945 --> 00:42:16,173
I talked to them.

445
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,814
Don't they know they're inviting
trouble by stealing our cattle?

446
00:42:19,016 --> 00:42:21,109
They know there's no cavalry
around here.

447
00:42:21,318 --> 00:42:23,343
I tried to reason with them,
but they wouldn't listen.

448
00:42:23,554 --> 00:42:27,490
My advice is to charge the beef off
to Indian good-will and let it go.

449
00:42:31,562 --> 00:42:35,123
As I was boss of the herd, I reckon
it's my fault they were stolen.

450
00:42:35,332 --> 00:42:37,197
The best thing I can do is quit
and clear out.

451
00:42:37,601 --> 00:42:39,068
That's nonsense, Shaw.

452
00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:41,931
You can't be held responsible
for something like this.

453
00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:44,300
Besides, I need you.

454
00:42:45,943 --> 00:42:48,002
You're the boss.

455
00:42:51,115 --> 00:42:54,141
-Sue!
-Hello, Ed.

456
00:42:54,451 --> 00:42:56,146
-Hello, Mr. Shaw.
-Howdy, Miss Creighton.

457
00:42:56,353 --> 00:42:57,911
-Hello.
-Hello.

458
00:42:58,122 --> 00:43:00,181
What in heaven's name
are you doing out here?

459
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:03,325
Why, I'm the new operator
you sent for.

460
00:43:03,527 --> 00:43:05,722
Are you responsible for this?

461
00:43:05,929 --> 00:43:07,453
Well, I telegraphed Omaha...

462
00:43:07,664 --> 00:43:08,892
but I didn't know
who they were going to send.

463
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:10,464
I'll bet you didn't.

464
00:43:10,667 --> 00:43:13,101
Seems very much as if
nobody wanted me.

465
00:43:13,303 --> 00:43:15,897
Driver, when does
that eastbound stage pass here?

466
00:43:16,206 --> 00:43:17,696
ln an hour or two.

467
00:43:18,509 --> 00:43:20,704
You're going right back to Omaha,
young lady...

468
00:43:20,911 --> 00:43:24,244
and you're going to stay there
until I really send for you.

469
00:43:25,149 --> 00:43:27,549
I can't help it if you send me back...

470
00:43:27,751 --> 00:43:29,218
but it was worth the trip
just to see you.

471
00:43:29,419 --> 00:43:30,943
Now, now. None of that.

472
00:43:31,155 --> 00:43:32,884
I'd like to show you
our thriving metropolis.

473
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:34,955
You really need a guide
to get about, you know.

474
00:43:35,192 --> 00:43:38,684
Very nice of you, Blake, but I want
you to go ahead with the wagons.

475
00:43:38,896 --> 00:43:40,488
-But...
-Shaw, you'll be responsible...

476
00:43:40,697 --> 00:43:41,994
for Miss Creighton
while she's here.

477
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:45,225
and seeing that she gets safely
on the eastbound stage.

478
00:43:45,435 --> 00:43:47,960
It'll be a pleasure, Sir.

479
00:43:48,205 --> 00:43:50,605
Well, I must be off, it seems.

480
00:43:50,807 --> 00:43:52,672
-Goodbye, Miss Creighton.
-Goodbye, Mr. Blake.

481
00:43:52,876 --> 00:43:54,070
-I'm sorry you couldn't stay.
-So am l...

482
00:43:54,278 --> 00:43:56,746
but then that's
the telegraph business for you.

483
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,812
Sue.

484
00:44:05,022 --> 00:44:08,549
-Is he responsible for this?
-No, not altogether.

485
00:44:08,759 --> 00:44:10,420
I just wanted to see you.
Honest I did.

486
00:44:10,627 --> 00:44:12,390
We're going to be in Salt Lake
before you know it.

487
00:44:12,596 --> 00:44:15,224
-Oh, I hope so.
-I've got to go now.

488
00:44:15,432 --> 00:44:16,456
The men are waiting
at the head of the line.

489
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:18,760
So soon?
I've a thousand things to ask you.

490
00:44:18,969 --> 00:44:20,231
And I've got
a thousand things to do.

491
00:44:20,437 --> 00:44:22,064
-Goodbye, dear.
-Goodbye, Edward.

492
00:44:22,272 --> 00:44:23,899
Remember, the next time
I pay you a visit...

493
00:44:24,107 --> 00:44:25,665
that I'm your only sister
and that I love you.

494
00:44:25,876 --> 00:44:27,810
Yes.

495
00:44:31,148 --> 00:44:33,446
I think he's a great man.

496
00:44:34,451 --> 00:44:37,443
The whole family's sort of great.

497
00:44:48,699 --> 00:44:50,599
It's coming.

498
00:44:59,042 --> 00:45:00,066
What is it?

499
00:45:00,277 --> 00:45:01,744
It's message from my brother
at the end of the line.

500
00:45:01,945 --> 00:45:04,379
He says "Haven't you gone yet?"

501
00:45:05,482 --> 00:45:08,212
-What did you say?
-"No."

502
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,025
Thank you.

503
00:45:19,529 --> 00:45:21,087
It's beautiful.

504
00:45:21,298 --> 00:45:24,529
My brother says it looks like me,
but, of course, he's prejudiced.

505
00:45:24,735 --> 00:45:27,033
No, ma'am, not this time.

506
00:45:36,713 --> 00:45:38,305
This way.

507
00:45:41,118 --> 00:45:43,848
Sort of quiet
with Western Union gone.

508
00:45:44,054 --> 00:45:48,252
It'll be fifty years before Sinking
Wells has so much excitement again.

509
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:51,188
Like me, after the stage leaves.

510
00:45:51,795 --> 00:45:55,128
I hope I haven't said anything
I hadn't ought to.

511
00:45:56,933 --> 00:45:58,423
You haven't.

512
00:45:58,635 --> 00:46:01,035
I know I haven't a chance against
somebody like Blake, but...

513
00:46:01,238 --> 00:46:02,933
Hadn't you better let me
decide that?

514
00:46:07,744 --> 00:46:10,679
I should've met you
a couple of years ago.

515
00:46:11,114 --> 00:46:13,241
Why?

516
00:46:14,117 --> 00:46:17,245
Since then
I've made some mistakes.

517
00:46:17,454 --> 00:46:19,251
Mistakes can be corrected.

518
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:23,350
Not always.

519
00:47:02,132 --> 00:47:05,067
Does this here stage connect with
the railroad that goes to St. Joe?

520
00:47:05,268 --> 00:47:09,932
-She sure do, Partner.
-Mister, you got a passenger.

521
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:17,605
How's about you and me taking a
little walk to work up an appetite?

522
00:47:18,448 --> 00:47:21,508
But I don't feel like walking
and I don't feel like eating.

523
00:47:21,718 --> 00:47:24,881
Just the same,
that's what you're gonna do.

524
00:47:32,396 --> 00:47:34,557
I may not be seeing you again.

525
00:47:34,931 --> 00:47:37,900
Don't say that.
We'll meet in Salt Lake.

526
00:47:38,101 --> 00:47:39,398
Maybe.

527
00:47:39,603 --> 00:47:42,128
Anyhow, I'll be thinking of you.

528
00:47:49,446 --> 00:47:51,744
This might help you.

529
00:48:00,891 --> 00:48:02,381
Goodbye.

530
00:48:02,592 --> 00:48:04,526
Goodbye, Sue.

531
00:48:04,728 --> 00:48:06,958
Get up.

532
00:48:38,495 --> 00:48:40,326
Shaw!

533
00:48:46,369 --> 00:48:48,530
Looks like we got company.

534
00:48:55,912 --> 00:48:58,073
Mount your horse
and warn the others.

535
00:48:58,281 --> 00:48:59,873
Hurry! Jimmy! Eddie!

536
00:49:00,016 --> 00:49:02,678
We're moving back
to the main camp! Indians!

537
00:49:27,377 --> 00:49:30,608
Get your guns and fall back!
Indians coming!

538
00:49:52,135 --> 00:49:53,796
What's the matter, sonny?
You look a mite bit peaked.

539
00:49:54,037 --> 00:49:55,197
A bunch of Sioux coming!

540
00:49:55,405 --> 00:49:56,895
Ain't you traveling
in the wrong direction?

541
00:49:57,107 --> 00:49:58,199
I've gotta warn the men
at the main camp.

542
00:49:58,408 --> 00:49:59,739
I'm just about
to make this connection.

543
00:49:59,943 --> 00:50:02,434
Maybe it'd be quicker
if you warned them by telegraph.

544
00:50:02,646 --> 00:50:05,171
That is, unless you're anxious
to get outta here.

545
00:50:05,382 --> 00:50:07,577
Pull over, Partner.
Get up!

546
00:50:08,585 --> 00:50:10,985
Get up!

547
00:50:15,058 --> 00:50:18,289
You handle the key and I'll
make the connection for you.

548
00:50:29,072 --> 00:50:31,040
Come on. Hurry up.

549
00:50:31,241 --> 00:50:34,677
Don't you worry, sonny. I ain't
gonna let them Indians get you.

550
00:50:41,051 --> 00:50:44,509
Swing your wagons so we can get
behind them if we have to.

551
00:50:44,721 --> 00:50:47,212
We'll make our stand here.

552
00:51:17,988 --> 00:51:22,118
-Mr. Creighton!
-You gone crazy?

553
00:51:22,325 --> 00:51:24,589
Indians are raiding
the head of the line.

554
00:51:24,794 --> 00:51:26,762
Indians! They're raiding
the head of the line.

555
00:51:28,264 --> 00:51:30,892
No. You stay here, Pat. I'll go.

556
00:52:05,001 --> 00:52:07,367
They're on their way!

557
00:52:13,076 --> 00:52:14,737
-Put it away. You won't need it.
-I'm not so sure.

558
00:52:14,944 --> 00:52:18,243
I am, and until Mr. Creighton
gets here, I'm boss.

559
00:52:27,924 --> 00:52:30,256
Take it easy.
They'll stop.

560
00:52:42,238 --> 00:52:43,398
How.

561
00:52:43,606 --> 00:52:45,164
How.

562
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:48,173
-Whiskey?
-No Whiskey for Indian brother.

563
00:52:48,378 --> 00:52:51,370
-You give whiskey.
-No got.

564
00:52:51,881 --> 00:52:54,179
Me look.

565
00:52:56,553 --> 00:52:58,919
Let'em alone.

566
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:24,977
Why, you drunken heathen.

567
00:53:26,282 --> 00:53:29,012
If I had my way, I'd blast
their dirty heads off.

568
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:31,210
Steady.

569
00:53:46,736 --> 00:53:49,830
-Hey, put that down.
-Stay where you are. I'll get it.

570
00:54:02,218 --> 00:54:04,152
Good!

571
00:54:09,392 --> 00:54:10,882
Can't have.

572
00:54:11,094 --> 00:54:13,494
Me keep. Good medicine.

573
00:54:13,696 --> 00:54:15,561
No keep!

574
00:54:29,479 --> 00:54:31,413
Stop! I can handle him.

575
00:54:39,956 --> 00:54:42,117
Yippee! There they come!

576
00:54:59,976 --> 00:55:01,000
I ought to take you apart.

577
00:55:01,211 --> 00:55:03,042
I suppose that's the thanks I get
for trying to help you.

578
00:55:03,246 --> 00:55:04,474
Whenever I need your help,
I'll ask for it.

579
00:55:04,681 --> 00:55:05,670
If you ever get my help again...

580
00:55:05,882 --> 00:55:07,577
you'll have to get down
on your knees and beg for it.

581
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,760
Indians are raiding
the main camp!

582
00:56:41,144 --> 00:56:43,476
-Thanks, Charlie.
-You're welcome, Doc.

583
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,739
I think you're gonna lose
this patient.

584
00:56:45,949 --> 00:56:48,042
Not if I'm as good doctor
as you are with that hatchet.

585
00:56:48,251 --> 00:56:50,515
I wouldn't mind so much if he was
only an Indian, but he ain't.

586
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:52,385
What?

587
00:56:52,588 --> 00:56:55,113
No Indian ever looked like that.

588
00:57:04,133 --> 00:57:06,863
I've got to keep this fellow alive.

589
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:09,538
Mr. Creighton'll want
to ask him a few questions.

590
00:57:09,739 --> 00:57:11,764
Doctor.

591
00:57:14,644 --> 00:57:17,943
I got to have medical attention
and I gotta have it quick.

592
00:57:18,147 --> 00:57:19,739
-Are you shot, Herman?
-No, I ain't.

593
00:57:19,949 --> 00:57:22,076
What's the matter with you?

594
00:57:23,686 --> 00:57:28,055
This is private,
and it's gotta be kept private.

595
00:57:35,164 --> 00:57:38,429
Well, our white Indian
didn't make it, Mr. Creighton.

596
00:57:39,102 --> 00:57:40,933
Did he say anything
before he died?

597
00:57:41,137 --> 00:57:43,970
He called me a few bad names
while I was sewing him up.

598
00:57:44,173 --> 00:57:46,300
Have him buried immediately.

599
00:57:46,509 --> 00:57:48,568
I don't want the men to know
for the time being.

600
00:57:48,778 --> 00:57:51,474
He's being slapped
with a spade right now.

601
00:57:53,983 --> 00:57:56,679
-What do you think of this, Shaw?
-I don't know.

602
00:57:56,886 --> 00:57:59,719
-You got any ideas?
-No.

603
00:57:59,922 --> 00:58:03,380
You said those Indians that you met
today were drunk, didn't you?

604
00:58:03,593 --> 00:58:04,582
Yeah.

605
00:58:04,794 --> 00:58:08,753
A white man disguised as an Indian
participated in the raid.

606
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:11,195
That means white men have got
the real Indians drunk...

607
00:58:11,401 --> 00:58:14,165
and talked them
into attacking us.

608
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:16,702
They ain't all Yankee out here,
you know.

609
00:58:16,906 --> 00:58:18,635
Apparently not.

610
00:58:18,841 --> 00:58:22,971
You sure those Indians that got away
with our beef were Indians?

611
00:58:26,315 --> 00:58:29,011
They looked like Indians to me.

612
00:58:30,386 --> 00:58:32,581
All right, that's all, boys.

613
00:58:32,789 --> 00:58:35,314
Now go on about your jobs
as if nothing had happened.

614
00:58:35,525 --> 00:58:38,619
Shaw, you're taking over
Grogan's job as foreman.

615
00:58:39,028 --> 00:58:41,963
I don't have to tell you
what a responsibility it is.

616
00:58:43,566 --> 00:58:45,796
Thanks, Mr. Creighton,
but I can't take that job.

617
00:58:46,002 --> 00:58:47,993
I haven't had the experience.

618
00:58:48,371 --> 00:58:50,498
You've had more experience
than any man in the outfit.

619
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,068
I want to, only...

620
00:58:52,275 --> 00:58:54,835
You're not going to let me down
at a time like this, are you, Shaw?

621
00:58:55,044 --> 00:58:57,911
Somebody has got to take charge of
things and pick out some new horses.

622
00:58:58,114 --> 00:59:00,810
I can do that. There ought to be
sixty or seventy head in Sage.

623
00:59:01,017 --> 00:59:01,984
Then you'll take the job?

624
00:59:07,094 --> 00:59:08,721
If that's the way you
want it, Mr. Creighton.

625
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:11,787
That's the way I want it.

626
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:14,126
We'll go into town tomorrow.
We'll buy up whatever we can.

627
00:59:14,335 --> 00:59:17,361
-All right. Good night.
-Good night.

628
00:59:22,543 --> 00:59:24,511
May I talk to you
for a minute, Sir?

629
00:59:24,712 --> 00:59:25,804
Of course.

630
00:59:26,013 --> 00:59:29,346
I don't like to butt in, I think
we're making a grave mistake.

631
00:59:29,617 --> 00:59:31,642
-Yes?
-I know you have great faith in Shaw.

632
00:59:31,852 --> 00:59:35,219
You've just made him foreman
and no doubt he deserved the post.

633
00:59:35,422 --> 00:59:36,980
Come to the point, Blake.

634
00:59:37,191 --> 00:59:39,489
Well, it seems to me if we ever
want to get this wire strung...

635
00:59:39,693 --> 00:59:42,321
we'll have to act differently
than we have, up to now.

636
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:44,088
What do you mean?

637
00:59:44,298 --> 00:59:46,823
You know I'm not looking
for a fight or trouble, but...

638
00:59:47,034 --> 00:59:50,595
look what happened to our cattle.
Look what happened today.

639
00:59:50,804 --> 00:59:52,635
I suppose Shaw
knows his business...

640
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,905
but he let those Indians
manhandle us...

641
00:59:55,109 --> 00:59:58,636
you'd think he was encouraging
them to strike at us again.

642
01:00:04,218 --> 01:00:07,346
However I guess there's a lot about
the West I never will understand.

643
01:00:08,956 --> 01:00:11,117
Good night.

644
01:00:11,859 --> 01:00:13,986
Good night.

645
01:00:36,717 --> 01:00:39,151
Well, I don't think we'll have
to go any farther.

646
01:00:40,254 --> 01:00:42,484
Come on.

647
01:00:50,364 --> 01:00:52,457
Howdy, Vance.

648
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:55,030
Howdy, Jack.

649
01:00:56,637 --> 01:00:59,697
You're Ed Creighton
of Western Union, ain't you?

650
01:00:59,907 --> 01:01:01,932
That's right.

651
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:05,337
My name's Jack Slade.

652
01:01:05,546 --> 01:01:08,276
-Nice bunch of horses, ain't they?
-Very nice.

653
01:01:08,482 --> 01:01:10,006
You wouldn't be in the market,
would you?

654
01:01:10,217 --> 01:01:12,151
I might. How much
do you want for them?

655
01:01:12,353 --> 01:01:13,718
Five thousand dollars
and help yourself.

656
01:01:14,121 --> 01:01:17,352
Our camp was raided yesterday by
Indians. They got most of our stock.

657
01:01:17,558 --> 01:01:19,617
Then these ought to be
just the thing for you.

658
01:01:19,827 --> 01:01:22,091
They ought to, they're ours.

659
01:01:22,296 --> 01:01:24,093
I said they're ours.
They were stolen from us.

660
01:01:24,298 --> 01:01:25,890
Now look here, Creighton...

661
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,068
you wouldn't accuse me
of being a horse thief, would you?

662
01:01:28,535 --> 01:01:30,196
No. I'll wait till I've heard
your explanation.

663
01:01:30,571 --> 01:01:33,165
I got these horses from
a bunch of Indians.

664
01:01:33,374 --> 01:01:36,343
-They didn't say where they got them.
-You didn't ask.

665
01:01:36,543 --> 01:01:40,001
No, I didn't. And in this country
when you call a man a horse thief...

666
01:01:40,214 --> 01:01:41,203
you better have some proof.

667
01:01:41,415 --> 01:01:44,851
I bought these horses in good faith.
I aim to sell them the same way.

668
01:01:45,052 --> 01:01:46,883
I guess I'd better see
the law about this.

669
01:01:47,321 --> 01:01:49,414
You'll have to go back
to Omaha if you do.

670
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:52,558
-It don't run beyond there.
-I'll make some of my own.

671
01:01:53,193 --> 01:01:55,127
That wouldn't look so good,
would it?

672
01:01:55,329 --> 01:01:58,230
Western Union stringing up white men
for what a bunch of Indians did.

673
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,458
You've got all the
answers, haven't you?

674
01:02:01,935 --> 01:02:04,062
Shaw there might be able
to give you a few more.

675
01:02:04,371 --> 01:02:07,397
He knows this country inside out.

676
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:11,971
What he says makes sense, Mr.
Creighton. At least it does out here.

677
01:02:14,782 --> 01:02:16,943
All right, I'm going to give you
that five thousand dollars...

678
01:02:17,151 --> 01:02:19,483
because I've got a lot of work to do
and no time for fighting.

679
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:23,121
I'm paying on the assumption
that 5,000 dollars will buy you off.

680
01:02:23,323 --> 01:02:26,952
If you bother Western Union again,
the next payment will be in lead.

681
01:02:27,361 --> 01:02:28,953
Is that clear?

682
01:02:29,229 --> 01:02:30,753
-Now listen, Creighton...
-Make out a bill of sale.

683
01:02:30,964 --> 01:02:33,296
I'll meet you at the saloon
in fifteen minutes.

684
01:02:37,738 --> 01:02:40,206
You two seem to know
one another pretty well.

685
01:02:40,407 --> 01:02:41,999
Yeah, we do.

686
01:02:42,209 --> 01:02:45,201
-Old friends?
-More or less.

687
01:02:45,412 --> 01:02:48,381
We were both raised
in the same corner of Missouri.

688
01:03:21,749 --> 01:03:24,513
-What'll you have?
-The bill of sale.

689
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:30,750
There it is.

690
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,828
All right. Here's a draft
on the Bank of Omaha...

691
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:39,624
for five thousand dollars.

692
01:03:44,505 --> 01:03:46,803
You can cash this by
telegraph if you want.

693
01:03:47,007 --> 01:03:49,840
Oh, no. I trust you.

694
01:03:51,078 --> 01:03:54,377
I suppose you deal in cattle, too.

695
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:58,142
Well, I ain't lately,
but if you're in the market...

696
01:03:58,352 --> 01:03:59,649
Just a question.

697
01:03:59,853 --> 01:04:02,378
Well, Mr. Creighton, you're a right
good man to do business with.

698
01:04:02,523 --> 01:04:04,582
But only once.

699
01:04:22,342 --> 01:04:25,038
Five thousand dollars!
Did all right by that outfit.

700
01:04:25,245 --> 01:04:28,646
Yeah, and I ain't said goodbye
to Mr. Ed Creighton yet.

701
01:04:28,849 --> 01:04:30,646
-No?
-No.

702
01:04:30,851 --> 01:04:35,481
But, first of all, I want to take a drink
to the Confederate States of America.

703
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:38,724
If there was no Confederates,
there wouldn't be no war.

704
01:04:38,926 --> 01:04:40,518
Ain't that something to drink to?

705
01:04:40,727 --> 01:04:42,524
-Yeah, but I think...
-You know...

706
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:47,526
a good thing can be made to last
a long time if you don't spoil it.

707
01:04:47,734 --> 01:04:50,066
Besides, I'm a patriot.

708
01:05:02,549 --> 01:05:04,107
Halt!

709
01:05:08,755 --> 01:05:10,552
Are you Mr. Creighton?

710
01:05:10,757 --> 01:05:12,782
Yes, I'm Creighton.

711
01:05:13,427 --> 01:05:15,918
I'm Captain Harlow,
from Fort Laramie.

712
01:05:16,129 --> 01:05:18,825
-How do you do, Captain?
-I'm afraid I've got bad news for you.

713
01:05:19,299 --> 01:05:21,767
Chief Spotted Horse of the Ogallala
Sioux has sent in word...

714
01:05:21,969 --> 01:05:24,028
that you can't build any more line
through his nation.

715
01:05:24,238 --> 01:05:25,466
No? Why not?

716
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:27,264
One of your men wounded
his son yesterday.

717
01:05:27,741 --> 01:05:29,140
They were drunk, Captain.

718
01:05:29,443 --> 01:05:33,106
They raided our camp afterward
and they killed several of my men.

719
01:05:33,313 --> 01:05:36,077
Spotted Horse says none of his
Indians killed any white man.

720
01:05:36,283 --> 01:05:38,513
Some renegades got a few
of his young bucks drunk...

721
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:40,550
and talked them into a horse-stealing
raid to get some more whiskey.

722
01:05:40,754 --> 01:05:41,846
The renegades did the killing.

723
01:05:42,189 --> 01:05:44,953
So the chief feels that
white men are to blame.

724
01:05:45,158 --> 01:05:47,991
-Who are the renegades?
-Spotted Horse says he doesn't know.

725
01:05:48,195 --> 01:05:51,358
Indians or not, I'm going ahead
with the line, Captain.

726
01:05:51,565 --> 01:05:53,897
-The Government is counting on it.
-I realize that, Mr. Creighton.

727
01:05:54,101 --> 01:05:56,069
Washington has already notified me
to help you all I can...

728
01:05:56,270 --> 01:06:00,070
but most of my troops have been
ordered to the army of the Potomac.

729
01:06:00,274 --> 01:06:03,209
Besides, an Indian war means a
massacre. You wouldn't want that.

730
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:06,106
-Of course not.
-We have Spotted Horse's brother...

731
01:06:06,313 --> 01:06:09,749
at Fort Kearney as a hostage for the
good behavior of the Ogallala.

732
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:11,815
I might try putting
a little pressure on him.

733
01:06:12,019 --> 01:06:14,010
-Maybe in two or three weeks...
-I can't wait.

734
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:17,987
See, winter is almost here and from
now on every day counts.

735
01:06:18,525 --> 01:06:21,392
If I could talk with the Chief
perhaps I could change his mind.

736
01:06:21,595 --> 01:06:23,654
I'm afraid that's too great a risk.
After what's happened you'd have to...

737
01:06:23,864 --> 01:06:27,766
go into his territory alone or with
a couple of men, and unarmed.

738
01:06:27,968 --> 01:06:29,629
Even then, there's no telling
what he might do.

739
01:06:29,836 --> 01:06:33,294
We've got to take that chance
and with your permission, we will.

740
01:06:33,507 --> 01:06:35,270
Thank you.

741
01:06:41,949 --> 01:06:43,883
Come on!

742
01:07:09,576 --> 01:07:13,672
-Mean looking devils, aren't they?
-Just don't get your wires crossed.

743
01:07:14,147 --> 01:07:15,876
Whatever we do,
we got to do quick.

744
01:07:16,083 --> 01:07:19,211
Indians can't stay interested
in one thing very long.

745
01:07:31,498 --> 01:07:34,399
That's him.
Hook up your wires.

746
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:37,603
-How.
-How.

747
01:07:45,278 --> 01:07:47,712
He says you come in peace today,
but there won't be any peace...

748
01:07:47,914 --> 01:07:51,213
if you try to take the singing wire
through the Ogallala nation.

749
01:07:51,418 --> 01:07:55,821
Tell him the Great White Father who
speaks over the singing wire is...

750
01:07:56,023 --> 01:07:58,048
sorry for the wounding
of his indian son...

751
01:07:58,258 --> 01:08:02,490
but that the lightning talk is strong
medicine and it must go through.

752
01:08:16,743 --> 01:08:20,702
He says the Ogallala doesn't believe
the singing wire's strong medicine.

753
01:08:20,914 --> 01:08:23,508
Ask him if he'll let ten
of his strongest braves...

754
01:08:23,717 --> 01:08:25,344
hold the tongue
of the singing wire...

755
01:08:25,552 --> 01:08:27,019
that is, after we've proved
it's harmless.

756
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:59,375
He says yes.

757
01:09:15,702 --> 01:09:18,865
He wants to know why
we pour water on the ground.

758
01:09:21,608 --> 01:09:24,543
Tell him we must make sacrifice
to the Rain God...

759
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:27,008
who's brother to the Lightning.

760
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:35,952
Spotted Horse sees the connection
between the Gods.

761
01:09:36,256 --> 01:09:38,247
Now hold the wire, Shaw,
and explain to him that it's...

762
01:09:38,492 --> 01:09:41,723
good medicine for us,
but it's bad for our enemies.

763
01:10:10,724 --> 01:10:12,521
Let them have it.

764
01:10:27,174 --> 01:10:29,165
That's enough, Blake.

765
01:10:52,899 --> 01:10:54,560
He says the Great
White Father's lightning...

766
01:10:54,768 --> 01:10:56,736
is the strongest medicine
they've ever seen...

767
01:10:56,937 --> 01:10:59,064
that the singing wire can go through
his nation in peace.

768
01:10:59,272 --> 01:11:02,036
Tell him I promise that the singing
wire will make good medicine...

769
01:11:02,242 --> 01:11:03,971
for the Ogallala against
their enemies.

770
01:11:14,421 --> 01:11:16,082
He says peace, peace.

771
01:11:16,289 --> 01:11:19,122
Now let's get out of here before they
have a chance to think it over.

772
01:11:49,189 --> 01:11:51,919
I was sure everything was going
to be all right from the first.

773
01:11:52,125 --> 01:11:53,820
-Weren't you?
-Of course.

774
01:11:54,027 --> 01:11:56,188
Never gave it a thought.

775
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:06,872
Barney, get up there!

776
01:12:29,296 --> 01:12:34,734
Boys, I've called you to give you
some good news for a change.

777
01:12:36,836 --> 01:12:39,270
We've practically licked our job.

778
01:12:39,472 --> 01:12:41,940
We're on the last leg
and the finish is almost in sight.

779
01:12:42,909 --> 01:12:45,377
You fellows have all
done a great job.

780
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:51,845
ln Salt Lake City, everybody gets
two months' pay as a bonus.

781
01:12:57,023 --> 01:13:00,424
And tonight, double portions
of grub for everybody.

782
01:13:05,699 --> 01:13:09,100
Come and get it.
Come and get it!

783
01:13:53,079 --> 01:13:55,206
Jack wants to see you, Vance.

784
01:13:55,749 --> 01:13:57,478
-What for?
-It's a matter of life and death.

785
01:13:57,684 --> 01:13:59,584
He had an argument with a fellow
over in Elkville and the fellow...

786
01:13:59,786 --> 01:14:01,777
plugged him in the stomach.

787
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:07,686
-Where is he?
-Only a couple of miles from here.

788
01:14:13,967 --> 01:14:16,902
All right. I'll meet you
on the other side of the camp.

789
01:14:17,904 --> 01:14:19,565
All right.

790
01:14:54,808 --> 01:14:57,402
Sorry, Vance, this is orders.

791
01:14:58,278 --> 01:15:00,303
Come on.

792
01:15:01,014 --> 01:15:03,005
Get the horses, boys.

793
01:15:07,153 --> 01:15:09,121
Hi, Vance.

794
01:15:10,757 --> 01:15:12,691
Now don't look so blamed sore.

795
01:15:12,892 --> 01:15:14,621
I got you up here
to save you from a roasting.

796
01:15:15,328 --> 01:15:18,058
I'm going to burn out
Western Union tonight.

797
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:20,255
Didn't want you
to be a part of it.

798
01:15:21,134 --> 01:15:24,297
-That's mighty white of you.
-Well, you used to be one of us...

799
01:15:24,504 --> 01:15:25,903
and as far as I'm
concerned, you still are.

800
01:15:26,139 --> 01:15:29,199
You kept your mouth shut and played
square. I didn't wanna see you hurt.

801
01:15:29,409 --> 01:15:30,569
Get hold of yourself, Jack.

802
01:15:30,777 --> 01:15:33,337
You can't fight a thing as big
and as important as Western Union.

803
01:15:33,546 --> 01:15:35,571
-Why, it's plumb loco to...
-No, it ain't, to me.

804
01:15:35,782 --> 01:15:37,716
If this thing don't work tonight,
something else will.

805
01:15:38,318 --> 01:15:40,445
I'm gonna stop'em if I have
to cut down every Yankee pole...

806
01:15:40,653 --> 01:15:45,420
between here and Omaha. Now,
are you gonna be with us or not?

807
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:49,494
Jack, I want to give you some
of the best advice you've ever had.

808
01:15:49,696 --> 01:15:51,789
-Yeah?
-Let Western Union alone.

809
01:15:51,998 --> 01:15:54,558
I'm not gonna let them alone
'till they've paid ten times over...

810
01:15:54,767 --> 01:15:58,703
for every foot of wire they're stringing.
This is better than owning a gold mine.

811
01:15:58,905 --> 01:16:01,430
Steal their cattle, steal their horses,
burn them out.

812
01:16:01,641 --> 01:16:04,007
When they need more wagon,
more horses, more cattle...

813
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:06,508
...we'll be on hand to sell it to them.
-You're a fool, Jack.

814
01:16:06,713 --> 01:16:08,977
You can't go against a thing
as big as this without getting hung.

815
01:16:09,415 --> 01:16:11,076
Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

816
01:16:11,284 --> 01:16:13,548
If you've got any sense,
you'll string along with us.

817
01:16:13,753 --> 01:16:15,118
I'll tell you what I'll do.

818
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:17,983
You come along with us, and I'll
cut you in for half of my share.

819
01:16:24,063 --> 01:16:27,157
-It's a bargain on one condition.
-Yeah?

820
01:16:27,367 --> 01:16:28,925
That you agree to give up
this bonfire business...

821
01:16:29,135 --> 01:16:30,124
and come back to Missouri with me.

822
01:16:30,703 --> 01:16:33,001
We'll join up with General Moseby
and be real guerillas.

823
01:16:35,408 --> 01:16:37,672
Tie him up, boys, and tight.

824
01:17:00,466 --> 01:17:03,094
Sure you won't change your mind
and come with us?

825
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:06,603
-Not this trip.
-All right.

826
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,408
Come on, boys.

827
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:20,270
I looked everywhere, Mr. Creighton,
but I can't find him.

828
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,744
-All right. I'll see him in the morning.
-Good night.

829
01:18:22,949 --> 01:18:25,144
Good night, Joe.

830
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:30,647
-You looking for Shaw?
-Yes.

831
01:18:30,857 --> 01:18:34,122
I saw him ride out of camp
over an hour ago.

832
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:24,832
This timber's so dry
it'll burn up like paper.

833
01:19:26,312 --> 01:19:28,439
Be sure you circle
the whole camp.

834
01:20:14,794 --> 01:20:18,924
Fire! Fire!
Everybody out! It's a forest fire!

835
01:20:19,132 --> 01:20:21,225
Forest fire! Come on!

836
01:20:21,434 --> 01:20:22,833
Blake!

837
01:20:23,703 --> 01:20:25,933
Come on! Get up! Get out!

838
01:20:28,007 --> 01:20:29,167
Come on, everybody!

839
01:20:29,375 --> 01:20:31,900
Take the horses out of the corral
and hitch them up.

840
01:20:38,317 --> 01:20:40,251
Hurry!

841
01:20:40,453 --> 01:20:44,048
-Get all this on the wagons. Hurry!
-It's warm tonight.

842
01:20:45,591 --> 01:20:48,992
Never mind that.
Get the insulators loaded.

843
01:21:31,370 --> 01:21:33,702
Blake, come here!
Give me a hand!

844
01:21:35,308 --> 01:21:38,300
The road's blocked.
Head for the lake!

845
01:21:45,384 --> 01:21:47,750
-Where do you want him, Doc?
-Ambulance.

846
01:22:16,315 --> 01:22:17,612
Come on, you fellows,
get out of here.

847
01:22:22,421 --> 01:22:25,083
Look out for that tree!

848
01:24:10,730 --> 01:24:13,426
You can come back for more.

849
01:24:14,367 --> 01:24:17,461
-Charlie.
-I'm so tired.

850
01:24:17,670 --> 01:24:18,864
What's the matter, Herman?
A little accident?

851
01:24:19,071 --> 01:24:20,936
No. When the fire started
licking at his boots..

852
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:23,574
he ran clean up
out of his britches.

853
01:24:26,679 --> 01:24:30,115
Come on, now, Cooky,
behave yourself.

854
01:24:30,316 --> 01:24:33,877
Here, eat your stew,
like a good boy.

855
01:24:34,086 --> 01:24:37,249
Here. This is a nice
little piece. Come on.

856
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:41,156
Isn't that good?

857
01:25:00,279 --> 01:25:03,214
I didn't think you got back
in time to get burned.

858
01:25:06,085 --> 01:25:09,145
-You're next, son.
-Shaw, come to my tent.

859
01:25:09,355 --> 01:25:11,516
I want to talk to you.

860
01:25:11,724 --> 01:25:13,419
Thanks, Doc.

861
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:35,010
-Ever see this before?
-No.

862
01:25:38,751 --> 01:25:41,982
Shaw, for a long time I've been
expecting you to tell me something...

863
01:25:42,188 --> 01:25:45,089
but you didn't.
I've given you every chance.

864
01:25:45,291 --> 01:25:48,852
The only conclusion I can draw now
is I was wrong about you.

865
01:25:51,897 --> 01:25:54,491
You know I didn't say anything
when the cattle was stolen...

866
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:57,294
and I didn't say anything
about that horse deal in Sage...

867
01:25:57,503 --> 01:26:01,132
but your absence last night
is something I won't put up with.

868
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:04,468
Now, once and for all,
I want the truth.

869
01:26:10,683 --> 01:26:14,210
All right, pack up your things
and get out.

870
01:26:15,788 --> 01:26:18,586
-Is that all?
-Yes.

871
01:26:33,639 --> 01:26:34,936
Well...

872
01:26:36,075 --> 01:26:40,341
-I see you're clearing out.
-Yeah, for good.

873
01:26:41,547 --> 01:26:44,675
After I go, there's a favor
I want you to do for me.

874
01:26:44,884 --> 01:26:46,818
A favor? For you?

875
01:26:47,186 --> 01:26:50,349
Tell Mr. Creighton
Jack Slade's my brother.

876
01:26:50,556 --> 01:26:51,750
Your brother?

877
01:26:52,024 --> 01:26:54,424
I wanted to tell him myself, but
when a fellow's your own brother...

878
01:26:54,627 --> 01:26:57,858
there ain't much you can say. I'm
going into Elkville on a little business.

879
01:26:58,063 --> 01:27:02,090
Tell Mr. Creighton not to worry. Jack
won't bother Western Union any more.

880
01:27:19,118 --> 01:27:22,178
-Give me a shave.
-It's a pleasure, friend.

881
01:27:46,745 --> 01:27:48,804
He's lose, Jack. And he's
here now looking for you.

882
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:50,914
-Alone?
-Yeah.

883
01:27:54,286 --> 01:27:57,813
-We'll stay here.
-All right.

884
01:27:59,525 --> 01:28:01,891
If you'll excuse me,
I think I'll go and have dinner.

885
01:28:02,094 --> 01:28:03,686
Put that cloth around me
and get to work.

886
01:28:03,896 --> 01:28:07,059
But my wife is a stickler
for punctuality, and...

887
01:28:07,266 --> 01:28:08,858
I live way over
on the other side of town.

888
01:28:09,068 --> 01:28:12,196
-Shut up and do as I tell ya.
-Yes, Sir.

889
01:28:14,406 --> 01:28:16,840
And be careful you don't nick me
if you know what's good for you.

890
01:28:17,042 --> 01:28:19,135
Oh, no, Sir.

891
01:28:42,434 --> 01:28:44,402
There he is.

892
01:28:56,282 --> 01:28:59,774
-Maybe he didn't see us.
-He's seen us all right.

893
01:29:00,319 --> 01:29:01,786
I know Vance.

894
01:29:01,987 --> 01:29:06,014
-What are we gonna do?
-That depends. We'll see.

895
01:29:37,423 --> 01:29:39,653
Here he comes.

896
01:30:18,997 --> 01:30:21,397
Howdy, Vance.

897
01:30:30,642 --> 01:30:33,076
Howdy, Jack.

898
01:30:33,612 --> 01:30:37,207
-Did you come to join us?
-No.

899
01:30:37,416 --> 01:30:40,180
I'm gonna give you
an even break, Jack.

900
01:30:40,386 --> 01:30:45,153
It can't go on this way any longer.
It's got to be either you or me, so...

901
01:30:45,824 --> 01:30:48,520
get up and take that apron off.

902
01:34:23,609 --> 01:34:25,543
-Blake.
-Well?

903
01:34:26,979 --> 01:34:30,109
Makes a nice sound, doesn't it,
coming across the continent?

904
01:34:32,050 --> 01:34:35,816
-It's music.
-I wish Shaw could hear it.

905
01:34:36,355 --> 01:34:39,586
It's a long way from Salt Lake City
to Boot Hill in Elkville...

906
01:34:39,791 --> 01:34:42,658
but I think he can hear it.
