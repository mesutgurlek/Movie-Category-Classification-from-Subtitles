3
00:01:01,237 --> 00:01:05,899
<i>There is a river</i>

4
00:01:06,075 --> 00:01:11,615
<i>Called the River of No Return</i>

5
00:01:13,249 --> 00:01:17,293
<i>Sometimes it's peaceful</i>

6
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:23,380
<i>And sometimes wild and free</i>

7
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:28,761

8
00:01:28,847 --> 00:01:34,932

10
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:45,814
<i>To be lost in the stormy sea</i>

11
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:48,657
<i>Wailaree ! </i>

12
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:51,612

<i>I can hear my lover call</i>

17
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:04,381
<i>Come to me</i>

18
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:07,170
<i>No return, no return</i>

19
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:14,057
<i>I lost my love on the river</i>

20
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:18,519

00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:25,310
<i>Gone, gone for ever</i>

23
00:02:25,402 --> 00:02:29,780
<i>Down the River of No Return</i>

24
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:31,110
<i>No return, no return</i>

25
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,572

27
00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:44,370
<i>She'll never return to me</i>

28
00:02:44,463 --> 00:02:47,831
<i>No return, no return, no return</i>

29
00:03:49,734 --> 00:03:53,732
- Your Bible, padre. Don't lose it now.
- Thank you.

30
00:03:53,822 --> 00:03:57,107
I expected to find a small trading post,

31
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,035
and instead... Sodom and Gomorrah.

32
00:04:00,954 --> 00:04:04,120
All because someone
has found gold in this earth.

33
00:04:04,207 --> 00:04:08,454
- You looking for it too, padre ?
- I came here as a missionary to the Indians.

34
00:04:08,544 --> 00:04:11,035
I think the white man will need me more.

35
00:04:21,182 --> 00:04:23,673
- Good evening, padre.
- Good evening.

36
00:04:27,146 --> 00:04:29,471
Who's in charge of all this ?

37
00:04:29,565 --> 00:04:31,641
The padre'd say the devil.

38
00:04:31,734 --> 00:04:34,521
What about this trading post ?
The devil got that too ?

39
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:36,687
No, I still got this.

40
00:04:38,115 --> 00:04:40,784
I'm looking for a boy. About nine ?

41
00:04:41,952 --> 00:04:44,869
He was to be delivered here
by a man named Martin.

42
00:04:44,955 --> 00:04:47,031
- You seen him ?
- They were here.

43
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:50,250
Were or are ?

44
00:04:50,335 --> 00:04:54,748
I understand the man took off for the hills
almost as soon as they pulled in.

45
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,915
What about the boy ?

46
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:59,713
He's probably walkin' around here, lost.

47
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,884
Well, if he comes in,
would you hold onto him for me ?

48
00:05:04,974 --> 00:05:07,845
- What's his name ?
- The name is Mark Calder.

49
00:05:07,936 --> 00:05:11,387
- How old did you say ?
- Nine.

50
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:13,639
What's your name ?

51
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:15,809
I'm not lost.

Take these beers
down the street to the barber.

79
00:08:02,022 --> 00:08:03,765
- You know where it is ?
- Yes, sir.

80
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:06,182
Bring back the money - cash.

81
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:10,024
And don't spill the beer, boy. It's liquid gold.

82
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:23,241
Hey !

83
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:55,315
Would you like to shoot at something taller ?

84
00:08:55,407 --> 00:08:58,942
- Like what, for instance ?
- Like me.

85
00:08:59,036 --> 00:09:01,443
Do you wanna get yourself a gun ?

86
00:09:01,538 --> 00:09:03,614
I don't think I need one.

87
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:31,264
- What's that tag on your coat ?
- The man who brought me here put it on.

88
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:33,435
I'm lookin' for my dad.

89
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,812
- What's your dad look like ?
- I don't know.

90
00:09:36,906 --> 00:09:39,064
I was just a kid last time I saw him.

91
00:09:41,285 --> 00:09:43,906
Would it be all right if he looked like me ?

92
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:47,448
Yes, sir. It would.

93
00:09:49,585 --> 00:09:51,874
I'm your dad.

94
00:09:51,962 --> 00:09:54,631
How do I know that ?

95
00:09:54,715 --> 00:09:57,087
The man who brought you here
was named Martin.

96
00:09:57,176 --> 00:10:00,627
I paid him a hundred dollars.
You came from Illinois.

97
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:02,797
Anybody coulda found that out.

98
00:10:10,689 --> 00:10:13,061
Who's this ?

99
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:15,225
My mother !

100
00:10:19,781 --> 00:10:21,857
All right, son. Let's get outta here.

101
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,069
- I have to say goodbye to Kay.
- Kay ? Who's Kay ?

102
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:27,319
She's the lady who sings in the saloon.

103
00:10:27,413 --> 00:10:30,747
- You have to do that ?
- Yes, sir. I have to.

104
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:33,743
All right. We'll do that first.

105
00:10:43,637 --> 00:10:47,635
Kay ! I found him ! This is him !

106
00:10:47,725 --> 00:10:52,636
You've got your nerve. Leaving this kid
running around a crummy place like this.

107
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:56,430
- What kind of a father are you, anyway ?
- The worst.

108
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:58,399
Well, it's nice you admit it.

109
00:10:58,485 --> 00:11:02,981
It's nice you helped him out.
I'd like to, uh... give you a little money.

110
00:11:03,073 --> 00:11:05,315
No, thanks. I've got a little.

111
00:11:06,243 --> 00:11:07,867
Well, thanks, then.

112
00:11:07,953 --> 00:11:10,029
Come on, boy.

113
00:11:10,914 --> 00:11:12,990
I hope I see you again sometime.

114
00:11:14,084 --> 00:11:17,784
- It's a pleasure meeting a gentleman.
- Thank you.

115
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,452
- Hey, you're forgetting your things.
- Oh !

116
00:11:22,926 --> 00:11:24,088
Thanks again.

117
00:11:24,177 --> 00:11:26,383
- Goodbye, Mark.
- Goodbye, Kay.

Diamonds in your hair,
rubies on your fingers.

162
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:56,832
- Bells on my toes.
- Pearls. And gowns made for queens.

163
00:14:56,926 --> 00:14:59,002
Except you'll look better in 'em.

164
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:02,420
How you gonna do it ?
With your deck o' cards ?

165
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:04,590
I've just done it.

166
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,847
- You hear what I said ? I've just done it.
- Just done what ?

167
00:15:09,938 --> 00:15:14,565
I've just won a gold claim,
right in the heart of the richest strike.

168
00:15:14,651 --> 00:15:15,980
Harry ! From whom ?

169
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:19,901
What's it matter ? All my life,
I've been chiseling in penny-ante games.

170
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,275
This time I got lucky !
This is the big one, honey. This is it !

171
00:15:23,368 --> 00:15:27,580
- Harry, what are you going to do ?
- What do you mean, "me" ? You and me.

172
00:15:27,664 --> 00:15:32,575
We're going to Council City and file a claim
before anything can happen to it, or us.

173
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:36,002
- What could happen ?
- Who knows ? Who cares ?

174
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:39,090
The man could get mad, say I did something.

175
00:15:39,175 --> 00:15:41,215
Did you ?

176
00:15:41,302 --> 00:15:47,138
I told you, honey. I got lucky, that's all. Just
lucky. Now, look. We gotta get outta here.

177
00:15:47,225 --> 00:15:51,436
I ransacked the town and there isn't
a horse to be had for the crown jewels.

178
00:15:51,521 --> 00:15:56,017
But I got another idea. We can buy a raft
and go to Council City on the river.

179
00:15:56,108 --> 00:15:59,145
- You got any money ?
- Well, I have a little.

180
00:15:59,904 --> 00:16:02,442
All right. Come on ! Come up with it.

181
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:15,493
10, 20...

182
00:16:19,381 --> 00:16:21,457
All you want is my money.

183
00:16:27,264 --> 00:16:29,340
Is it ?

184
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,767
We'll plant the field and hunt and fish.
How does that sound ?

185
00:16:33,853 --> 00:16:35,645
- Just you and me ?
- That's all.

186
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,767
- Fine. Sounds fine.
- We'll make out all right.

187
00:16:38,858 --> 00:16:42,310
I'll teach you to fish and trap.
You'll be as good as the best of'em.

188
00:16:42,403 --> 00:16:45,607
- And teach me to shoot ?
- Yeah, and shoot too.

189
00:16:57,543 --> 00:17:01,375
- What are they doin' ?
- They're just comin' to look around the town.

190
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:04,464
- They don't like what they see.
- Will they make a war ?

191
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:08,250
No, they're just hunting. When they
make a war, they paint their faces.

192
00:17:08,345 --> 00:17:10,587
Then you know they're hunting you.

193
00:17:30,992 --> 00:17:32,866
Mark !

194
00:17:32,953 --> 00:17:35,907
Come on, boy. Giddap ! Giddap ! Hey.

195
00:17:35,997 --> 00:17:38,037
Oh.

196
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:41,374
You can't just go through
everything in the world, boy.

197
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:44,248
Sometimes you have to back up
and go around.

198
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:48,002
- I just had it going good.
- You had it going very good,

199
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:52,137
but we don't wanna break our plough
or hurt our horse, now do we ?

200
00:17:55,058 --> 00:17:58,473
Come on. We'll go in the house
and have some coffee.

201
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:15,988
- Why did you name me Mark ?
- Simple.

202
00:18:16,078 --> 00:18:20,206
I'm Matthew. Mark follows Matthew.
It's the Bible.

203
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,366
- I follow you.
- Right.

204
00:18:22,459 --> 00:18:26,836
- And that's how you thought of it ?
- It wasn't me, it was your mother.

205
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:32,838
Come on, let's quit dreaming.

206
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:37,305
When we sell our first wheat, you got
a present coming. What do you want most ?

207
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,881
- A rifle for my own.
- You're getting it.

208
00:18:39,976 --> 00:18:42,467
Will we be rich, like the men finding gold ?

209
00:18:42,562 --> 00:18:45,349
No, but we'll beat those that don't find any.

210
00:18:46,483 --> 00:18:50,148
I was away from you a long time, Mark.
That's when I thought about it.

211
00:18:50,236 --> 00:18:54,565
I thought if a man doesn't know
what he's doing or where he's going,

212
00:18:54,657 --> 00:18:58,441
the best thing for him to do
is just back up and start all over again.

213
00:18:58,536 --> 00:19:02,035
I thought I'd start
with the ground and work up.

214
00:19:02,123 --> 00:19:04,530
So I sent for you, and this is it.

215
00:19:07,295 --> 00:19:10,877
Never saw a guy with so many questions.
You got any more ?

216
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:14,792
You never told me where you were.

217
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:21,511
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

218
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,221
Come on out here with me and I'll show you.

219
00:19:26,855 --> 00:19:30,900
- I can hit anything you can see.
- OK. That tree.

220
00:19:30,984 --> 00:19:33,771
- Now, how could I miss a tree ?
- The branch.

221
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:37,361
- Which one ?
- The one on the top, to the left.

222
00:19:37,449 --> 00:19:39,525
You got eyes like a grasshopper.

223
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:46,414
Man, oh, man.

224
00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:50,331
All right, your turn.
Now, this time you're gonna fire it.

225
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,496
Check it.

226
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:58,257
Hold it like I told you,
tight up against your shoulder.

227
00:19:58,344 --> 00:20:00,586
Lay your cheek right alongside of it.

228
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,756
- What's important ?
- To hit the target.

229
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:04,177
- When ?
- The first shot.

230
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:06,473
- Why ?
- Because I might not get another.

231
00:20:06,561 --> 00:20:09,134
All right. Take your time and aim.

232
00:20:09,897 --> 00:20:12,851
Flex the elbow. Relax !

233
00:20:13,901 --> 00:20:17,068
- What are you aiming at ?
- The branch on the right side.

234
00:20:17,154 --> 00:20:18,862
All right...

235
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:21,024
Wait a minute.

236
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:23,985
Maybe we better save that bullet.

237
00:20:47,851 --> 00:20:52,429
- What'll we do if they come with paint on ?
- We'll fight 'em. We cleared this land.

238
00:20:52,522 --> 00:20:55,973
It's ours, so we're gonna stay on it,
or under it. Come on.

239
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:59,021
You're not afraid of anything, are you ?

240
00:20:59,112 --> 00:21:00,310
Not with you.

241
00:21:01,572 --> 00:21:03,612
Matt, look !

242
00:21:10,206 --> 00:21:13,622
- Can you make 'em out ?
- Looks like a couple of men.

243
00:21:20,758 --> 00:21:22,834
Here, go get some rope.

244
00:21:25,804 --> 00:21:27,927
Hold it ! Hold it there.

245
00:21:28,015 --> 00:21:30,932
Hold it right there.
Let me get over here.

246
00:21:42,946 --> 00:21:45,022
Get the horse.

247
00:22:16,937 --> 00:22:19,013
Whoa !

248
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,099
All right, Mark. Take him out. Giddap !

249
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:26,187
Take him over to the right.

250
00:22:28,907 --> 00:22:30,983
More !

251
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:44,121
Here !

252
00:22:44,214 --> 00:22:46,290
Get ready to get off.

253
00:23:03,274 --> 00:23:05,101
Ooh !

254
00:23:05,193 --> 00:23:07,269
- My things !
- Let it go.

255
00:23:18,372 --> 00:23:22,417
- Believe it or not, this is our honeymoon.
- The idea is to live through it.

256
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:27,163
- Calder's my name. Matt Calder.
- Weston. Harry Weston. I sure thank you.

257
00:23:27,256 --> 00:23:30,672
- Hi !
- It's so good to see you again.

258
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:33,546
- You two know each other ?
- We're old friends.

259
00:23:33,637 --> 00:23:35,713
Come up to the cabin and dry off.

260
00:23:35,806 --> 00:23:38,344
- Son, run along and build up a fire.
- All right.

261
00:23:38,434 --> 00:23:40,509
Come on, I'll go with you.

262
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,637
- Let's go.
- I'm with you. Let's go.

263
00:23:47,943 --> 00:23:51,691
- What is this ? What you got here, Calder ?
- A farm.

264
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,149
Everybody is lookin' for gold
and you're diggin' a farm ?

265
00:23:55,242 --> 00:23:56,356
That's it.

266
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:59,867
- Maybe you know what you're doing.
- Well, I know that they don't.

267
00:23:59,954 --> 00:24:03,952
- Don't I know you from somewhere ?
- That might depend on what you do.

268
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:07,624
- I'm a gambler.
- Then you don't know me from anywhere.

269
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:12,006
- I always say "What's the difference ?"
- That's what I always say.

270
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:22,052
- He fixed the sweep on the raft.
- Yeah, he's a man in a hurry.

271
00:24:22,143 --> 00:24:25,559
It's a matter of life and death.
He's gotta get to Council City.

272
00:24:25,646 --> 00:24:28,351
- On that raft ?
- He says so.

273
00:24:28,441 --> 00:24:30,848
Well, don't bring his troubles to me.

274
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:34,061
She's beautiful, isn't she ?

275
00:24:34,154 --> 00:24:36,859
There's an old saying, Mark:
"It's only skin-deep."

276
00:24:36,949 --> 00:24:39,025
- What is ?
- Beauty.

277
00:24:41,662 --> 00:24:43,785
How deep should it be ?

278
00:24:43,872 --> 00:24:46,992
Well, ask her, son. She looks like an expert.

279
00:24:52,255 --> 00:24:54,331
- Hi.
- Hi, friend.

280
00:24:56,968 --> 00:25:01,963
Pretty elegant, aren't they ?
Gotta take care of them. They're all I got left.

281
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:06,634
- Why did you get married ?
- I fell in love.

282
00:25:06,728 --> 00:25:10,856
- How do you know when you fall in love ?
- I dunno. Can't eat or sleep.

283
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:15,401
- Like an ache in the stomach ?
- Same thing... only in the heart.

284
00:25:15,486 --> 00:25:18,606
- You'll find out when you get older.
- How old are you ?

285
00:25:18,698 --> 00:25:22,861
That's no question to ask a lady !
Not that I'm a lady.

286
00:25:22,952 --> 00:25:24,576
Why aren't you ?

287
00:25:24,662 --> 00:25:27,579
See me in about ten years.
I'll try and tell you.

288
00:25:27,665 --> 00:25:31,164
I said you were beautiful,
and he said beauty was skin-deep.

289
00:25:31,252 --> 00:25:35,036
- Who did ?
- Matt, my dad. He said it was an old saying.

290
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,206
It's an old saying by an old crow.

291
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:48,557
- When did you lose your mother ?
- It was while dad was away.

292
00:25:48,644 --> 00:25:50,767
That's why he sent for me.

293
00:25:50,854 --> 00:25:53,974
- Are you going to look for gold ?
- I could stand a little.

294
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:57,232
- What would you do with it ?
- Do with it ?

295
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:03,321
Buy fancy gowns, live in the swell hotels
in the big city. Go to the opera.

296
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:05,981
- What's that ?
- That's music.

297
00:26:06,077 --> 00:26:09,861
Very high-toned and fancy.
Not like mine.

298
00:26:09,956 --> 00:26:12,079
I like yours.

299
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:14,325
Would you sing one ?

300
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:17,835
I might have one for you, if I can remember it.

301
00:26:17,922 --> 00:26:19,998
It was a long time ago.

302
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,963
<i>When Mr South Wind sighs in the pine</i>

303
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:36,685
<i>Old Mr Winter whimpers and whines</i>

304
00:26:36,774 --> 00:26:38,648
<i>Down in the meadow</i>

305
00:26:38,734 --> 00:26:40,810
<i>Under the snow</i>

306
00:26:41,028 --> 00:26:46,188
<i>April is teachin' green things to grow</i>

307
00:26:46,742 --> 00:26:51,736
<i>When Mr West Wind howls in the glade</i>

308
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,368
<i>Old Mr Summer</i>

309
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:58,534
<i>Nods in the shade</i>

310
00:26:58,628 --> 00:27:00,420
<i>Down in the meadow</i>

311
00:27:00,505 --> 00:27:02,462
<i>Under the brook</i>

312
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:05,466
<i>Catfish are waitin' for the hook</i>

313
00:27:06,511 --> 00:27:10,212
<i>Old Lady Blackbird flirts with the scarecrow</i>

314
00:27:10,306 --> 00:27:14,351
<i>Scarecrow is wavin' at the moon</i>

315
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:18,303
<i>Old Mr Moon makes hearts everywhere go</i>

316
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:20,474
<i>Bump, bump</i>

317
00:27:21,192 --> 00:27:23,149
<i>With the magic of June</i>

318
00:27:23,236 --> 00:27:25,857
<i>All right, come and get it.</i>

319
00:27:26,614 --> 00:27:29,070
<i>When Mr East Wind</i>

320
00:27:29,325 --> 00:27:31,816
<i>Shouts overhead</i>

321
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,695
<i>Then all the leaves</i>

322
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:37,327
<i>Turn yellow and red</i>

323
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:40,285
<i>Down in the meadow</i>

324
00:27:40,377 --> 00:27:42,453
<i>Corn stalks are high</i>

325
00:27:42,588 --> 00:27:48,507
<i>Pumpkins are ripe and ready for pie</i>

326
00:27:49,928 --> 00:27:54,970
I look at you and I can't see you becomin'
a farmer. Anything else I might believe.

327
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,434
- I'll try and struggle along without you.
- Some more coffee ?

328
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,141
What do they do with the gold
after they find it ?

329
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:03,769
- They make money out of it.
- Why do they use gold ?

330
00:28:03,859 --> 00:28:07,524
- Because it's hard to get.
- Why don't they use something easy to get ?

331
00:28:07,612 --> 00:28:11,941
If something's easy to get, people
don't care about it. They don't value it.

332
00:28:12,033 --> 00:28:14,489
If it's hard to get, then you've got something.

333
00:28:14,577 --> 00:28:17,247
Like a mink ? A mink is hard to catch.

334
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,702
Now you've got it. That's the idea exactly.

335
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:22,994
- How about a skunk ?
- How about another dish ?

336
00:28:23,086 --> 00:28:28,210
Calder, how long do you think
it'll take us to get from here to Council City ?

337
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:31,798
- You don't know this country.
- No, but I got a map here.

338
00:28:34,597 --> 00:28:37,349
All right. You're right here.

339
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:41,386
Now, you had some trouble getting here,
and some luck too.

340
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:44,682
- There's Council City down there.
- That's not far.

341
00:28:44,773 --> 00:28:48,818
A good green log might not make those
rapids between here and Council City.

342
00:28:48,902 --> 00:28:51,607
- We made the last one.
- I know. I was there.

343
00:28:53,073 --> 00:28:56,774
The river drops from here.
The rapids get worse.

344
00:28:56,869 --> 00:29:00,284
You cut through a gorge
of solid wall for 15 miles.

345
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:02,495
The wall goes straight up.

346
00:29:02,582 --> 00:29:07,079
The other way is overland, but you
haven't got a gun, haven't got a horse.

347
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:11,417
- So you say it can't be done.
- You asked me how far it was, that's how far.

348
00:29:11,508 --> 00:29:13,168
That's enough.

349
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,711
Calder, I got a gold claim
to file in Council City.

350
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:18,714
I gotta get there.

351
00:29:18,807 --> 00:29:22,804
You can't imagine me being a farmer.
I can't imagine you a prospector.

352
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,851
Won it in a stud game.

353
00:29:24,938 --> 00:29:28,057
All my life, I won the little pots
and lost the big ones.

354
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:30,854
- This time I got lucky.
- Lucky ?

355
00:29:30,943 --> 00:29:34,644
With the boob I was playing,
cheatin' would have just gotten in the way.

356
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:38,155
- Then what's your hurry ?
- Maybe the man thinks like you do.

357
00:29:38,242 --> 00:29:40,034
That it wasn't just luck.

358
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:44,580
- What can he do about it now ?
- Maybe try to get to Council City, too.

359
00:29:44,665 --> 00:29:48,912
Might get there first,
which'd be bad for one of us.

360
00:29:49,003 --> 00:29:51,209
How much do you want
for your horse and gun ?

361
00:29:51,297 --> 00:29:54,582
Money ? What would I do ?
Plough that field with a silver dollar,

362
00:29:54,675 --> 00:29:56,751
then throw it in some Indian's face ?

363
00:29:56,844 --> 00:29:59,299
I gotta get there. How much d'you want ?

364
00:29:59,388 --> 00:30:02,839
Why don't you wait till I get
that field seeded, and I'll take you ?

365
00:30:02,933 --> 00:30:06,218
- I can't wait.
- Well, I can't go.

366
00:30:13,818 --> 00:30:15,894
It isn't there, Calder.

367
00:30:18,073 --> 00:30:20,149
Go on outside.

368
00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:22,985
Go on, you got a kid out there.

369
00:30:34,172 --> 00:30:36,710
Harry, what are you doing ?

370
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,713
I'm taking the gun, Calder,
and I'm borrowing the horse.

371
00:30:40,803 --> 00:30:42,879
Get it.

372
00:30:44,473 --> 00:30:46,632
Get it and no one will get hurt.

373
00:30:48,018 --> 00:30:50,094
Mark, go ahead. Do what he says.

374
00:30:52,356 --> 00:30:54,432
- No.
- Do it.

375
00:30:57,778 --> 00:31:00,732
This'll only take a few days,
then we'll be back.

376
00:31:00,823 --> 00:31:03,527
- Take the boy with you.
- Boy ? What for ?

377
00:31:03,617 --> 00:31:07,994
Indians, Weston. You've got the rifle.
Take the boy with it.

378
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,745
I can't do that, Calder. I'm in a hurry.
This can mean a fortune to me.

379
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:14,953
- It can mean his life.
- Get some food in a bag.

380
00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:17,121
Let the boy get it.

381
00:31:19,424 --> 00:31:21,500
Saddle the horse.

382
00:31:22,761 --> 00:31:26,094
Harry, we don't have to do this.
It's just a few days.

383
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:30,259
- It doesn't matter that much.
- Yes, it does.

384
00:31:30,351 --> 00:31:33,685
Four or five days might not
make any difference to a farmer,

385
00:31:33,771 --> 00:31:35,894
but they do to me.

386
00:31:35,982 --> 00:31:39,102
I'm not stealin' anything.
I'm just borrowin' it.

387
00:31:39,193 --> 00:31:41,352
You'll get paid plenty for the faith.

388
00:31:41,571 --> 00:31:46,316
A fistful of money in the hand's as good
as a fistful of wheat in the ground.

389
00:31:52,957 --> 00:31:55,033
Matt ! Matt !

390
00:32:08,347 --> 00:32:10,672
Look out, Mark, the gun !

391
00:32:16,855 --> 00:32:18,729
Matt ! Matt !

392
00:32:19,691 --> 00:32:23,475
- Come on, let's get outta here.
- You've killed my dad !

393
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:26,487
- He'll be all right. Get some water.
- Come on !

394
00:32:26,573 --> 00:32:29,942
- We can't leave him like this. He's hurt.
- He didn't have to be.

395
00:32:30,034 --> 00:32:32,822
He didn't have to get us off the raft either.

396
00:32:35,623 --> 00:32:39,372
- I think I'll wait here for you, Harry.
- What do you mean, "wait" ?

397
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:44,537
I mean what I said. I can't leave them
like this. I can't leave the boy.

398
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:48,843
You'll get to Council City twice
as fast without me, won't you ?

399
00:32:48,928 --> 00:32:51,335
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

400
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,965
Then you can have the claim filed
and be back here all the sooner.

401
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:57,550
You go ahead, Harry. I'll wait here.

402
00:32:57,645 --> 00:33:00,432
You won't take long, will you ?

403
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:03,310
Not with you here. You know that.

404
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:48,599
Stop worrying. He'll be all right.

405
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:52,858
It'd take more than the wooden end
of a rifle to kill him.

406
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:55,024
He's got a head like a boulder.

407
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:11,922
Hey, wait a minute.
What do you think you're doing ?

408
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:17,095
- Have they gone ?
- The man's gone. She's staying.

409
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,885
She didn't wanna leave us.

410
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,967
- Why not ?
- Because you were hurt.

411
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,678
- She told him she had to stay...
- He left you here to take care of me ?

412
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:30,481
Look, maybe I don't like what he did
or the way he did it, but he'll be back,

413
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,142
and you'll be taken care of.

414
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,314
That's nice.

415
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,859
Everybody's gonna take care of me.

416
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,989
So are they.

417
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:54,337
Well, we'll have to get outta here.
We'll take the raft. Come on, son.

418
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:59,170
- How can we take the raft ? You said...
- That doesn't count. We got no choice now.

419
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,339
You better get your junk.

420
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:12,138
- Come on, Kay.
- Let's go.

421
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,773
Just a minute. Hold this.

422
00:35:29,543 --> 00:35:31,619
Mark !

423
00:35:33,171 --> 00:35:35,247
Mark, hurry up !

424
00:36:15,671 --> 00:36:17,747
Matt ! Look !

425
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:32,680
It's all right, son. At least we're not in it.

426
00:36:33,563 --> 00:36:35,639
We'll build it up again.

427
00:36:40,737 --> 00:36:42,860
Wouldn't they have done it anyway ?

428
00:36:42,947 --> 00:36:46,067
- Against a rifle ?
- Wouldn't they ?

429
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:48,235
Not so easy.

430
00:36:57,795 --> 00:36:59,871
All right, hang on.

431
00:38:26,256 --> 00:38:30,040
If things keep on this way,
I'll be using up a good camisole.

432
00:38:30,135 --> 00:38:34,085
Next time, don't try to be so brave.
When you get hurt, yell.

433
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:37,347
- It just stung, then I forgot it.
- Listen to him !

434
00:38:37,434 --> 00:38:40,007
Keep still a second while I tie it.

435
00:38:40,103 --> 00:38:42,428
- I don't need this.
- Keep still.

436
00:38:43,732 --> 00:38:47,563
Well, I'm gonna see what I can do
with this in the river.

437
00:38:47,652 --> 00:38:51,235
The country's crawling with Indians,
and you're going fishing ?

438
00:38:51,322 --> 00:38:56,068
There are lots of ways to die.
Starving to death is not one of my favorites.

439
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,402
He does that for good luck.

440
00:38:58,496 --> 00:39:00,572
He'll need it to fish that way.

441
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:06,336
I oughta go out and hunt myself.
There should be some berries around here.

442
00:39:06,462 --> 00:39:09,131
- Where ?
- Oh, up along there.

443
00:39:10,174 --> 00:39:12,582
I'll pick them. You stay put.

444
00:39:21,185 --> 00:39:23,261
Now, stay put.

445
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,502
What do you think you're doing ?

446
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:00,430
Berries. I'm gathering berries.

447
00:40:00,515 --> 00:40:03,681
Not bad. I didn't think you were the type.

448
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,603
Even my type gets hungry.

449
00:40:06,687 --> 00:40:09,854
- Wanna show me your fish ?
- I left 'em in the river.

450
00:40:11,901 --> 00:40:14,818
Take some. Go on, take some.

451
00:40:17,907 --> 00:40:21,322
- Give some to the boy, huh ?
- Glad you reminded me.

452
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:23,652
I never would have thought of it !

<i>With the magic of June</i>

459
00:40:51,398 --> 00:40:54,601
<i>When Mr North Wind</i>

460
00:40:54,692 --> 00:40:58,026
<i>Blows on the breeze</i>

461
00:40:58,279 --> 00:41:01,364
<i>Old Father Christmas</i>

462
00:41:01,574 --> 00:41:05,073
<i>Trims over trees</i>

463
00:41:05,161 --> 00:41:07,782
<i>Down in the meadow</i>

464
00:41:07,872 --> 00:41:11,739
<i>Snow softly gleams</i>

465
00:41:11,834 --> 00:41:15,417
<i>Earth goes to sleep</i>

466
00:41:16,047 --> 00:41:27,258
<i>And smiles in her dreams</i>

467
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:31,886
Kinda small fish, aren't they ?

468
00:41:32,896 --> 00:41:37,605
There's an old saying:
"A small fish is better than an empty dish."

469
00:41:37,693 --> 00:41:40,729
Say, you got quite a stock
of those old sayings.

470
00:41:41,738 --> 00:41:44,656
Where did you ever learn a song like that ?

471
00:41:44,741 --> 00:41:48,157
I didn't go straight from
the cradle to a gold camp.

472
00:41:50,372 --> 00:41:52,448
Why did you ever go there at all ?

473
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:55,959
I had to live. At least, I thought so.

474
00:41:56,503 --> 00:41:58,579
I had to get money to get out.

475
00:42:00,632 --> 00:42:03,336
When I met Harry, he wanted the same thing.

476
00:42:04,093 --> 00:42:06,169
Then he won the claim.

477
00:42:06,262 --> 00:42:10,675
It was our big chance.
A chance for both of us to get away.

478
00:42:11,976 --> 00:42:15,677
- Where ?
- Out of the lives we were both living.

479
00:42:17,189 --> 00:42:20,973
To someplace where people
live like human beings.

480
00:42:21,068 --> 00:42:23,606
That's in heaven.

481
00:42:23,696 --> 00:42:27,029
We weren't thinking of
going quite that far with it.

482
00:42:27,992 --> 00:42:30,233
Well, you're both on the short cut.

483
00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:35,247
You're going after him, aren't you ?

484
00:42:35,332 --> 00:42:37,823
Yeah, that's it.

485
00:42:37,918 --> 00:42:40,290
But you said no one could go down the river.

486
00:42:40,379 --> 00:42:43,296
You said it'd be suicide if he tried it.

487
00:42:43,382 --> 00:42:46,336
He's not trying. I am.

488
00:42:47,594 --> 00:42:49,883
There's a difference.

489
00:42:49,971 --> 00:42:52,889
You're not gonna give him
a chance, are you ?

490
00:42:52,974 --> 00:42:55,014
Sure, I'll give him a chance.

491
00:42:55,101 --> 00:42:57,177
Same chance he gave me...

492
00:42:58,271 --> 00:43:00,347
and him.

493
00:43:58,005 --> 00:44:00,959
Next time you try that,
I'll forget that you're a woman.

494
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:03,126
I doubt that !

495
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:10,131
Just take my word for it. Fool.

496
00:44:10,226 --> 00:44:13,345
- Do you know what you're doing ?
- I think I do.

497
00:44:13,437 --> 00:44:18,229
Do you know how long we'd last out here
without that raft ? Without the rifle ?

498
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:20,684
The whole country alive with Indians ?

499
00:44:20,778 --> 00:44:23,185
Just how many kinds of fool are you ?

500
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,356
I'm not your kind.

501
00:44:25,449 --> 00:44:27,774
What are you ? Weston's kind ?

502
00:44:27,868 --> 00:44:32,364
You love that rat so much, you'd risk all
our lives just to keep me from getting him ?

503
00:44:32,456 --> 00:44:35,029
You couldn't understand.

504
00:44:36,126 --> 00:44:39,411
I just don't see it.
Treating you the way he did.

505
00:44:39,504 --> 00:44:43,003
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you how he didn't treat me.

506
00:44:43,091 --> 00:44:46,923
He didn't treat me like a tramp.
He treated me like a woman.

507
00:44:47,887 --> 00:44:52,929
So he made a mistake. If you had lived like
he has all of his life, on crumbs and bones,

508
00:44:53,393 --> 00:44:57,176
maybe you'd do a crazy thing
if you had a chance to make a fortune.

509
00:44:57,271 --> 00:44:59,643
Maybe you'd do a foolish thing yourself.

510
00:45:00,566 --> 00:45:03,686
I wouldn't leave a kid to die... or a woman,

511
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:07,276
even if she was a tramp.

512
00:45:08,074 --> 00:45:10,315
I suppose you never made a mistake.

513
00:45:11,368 --> 00:45:14,369
You're too perfect. You never made any.

514
00:45:14,496 --> 00:45:17,166
None that I didn't pay for, like he will.

515
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:21,037
All right. You know so much about him.

516
00:45:21,128 --> 00:45:23,204
But he knows about you, too.

517
00:45:23,297 --> 00:45:25,503
He knows all about you.

518
00:45:25,591 --> 00:45:28,757
If he made a mistake with you,
at least it wasn't murder.

519
00:45:28,844 --> 00:45:31,086
- What do you mean ?
- You know what I mean.

520
00:45:31,179 --> 00:45:35,307
He knew who you were. He knew where
you came from and what you did.

521
00:45:35,392 --> 00:45:38,227
He knew you killed a man
and went to prison for it.

522
00:45:38,311 --> 00:45:42,475
And why you went to prison:
because you shot him in the back.

523
00:45:51,407 --> 00:45:53,483
Go get the stuff on the raft.

524
00:45:55,244 --> 00:45:57,320
Come here, boy.

525
00:46:00,666 --> 00:46:03,204
I shoulda told you myself.

526
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:06,046
- You did what she said ?
- Yeah.

527
00:46:08,674 --> 00:46:11,711
Look. Look, the man was no good.

528
00:46:12,511 --> 00:46:16,509
He was trying to kill a friend of mine
so I shot him.

529
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:19,303
They sent me to prison for it.

530
00:46:19,393 --> 00:46:22,098
That's where I was
when I was away from you.

531
00:46:23,439 --> 00:46:27,436
I could have told you much easier
when you were older.

532
00:46:27,526 --> 00:46:32,484
- You shot him in the back ?
- Yeah, I shot him, in the back or in the front.

533
00:46:32,573 --> 00:46:34,779
What does it matter how you kill a snake ?

534
00:46:34,866 --> 00:46:37,571
What does it matter which way he's facing ?

535
00:46:41,748 --> 00:46:45,331
We'd better get moving.
You wanna help her with the stuff ?

536
00:47:43,683 --> 00:47:48,310
The Indians call it the River of No Return.
From here on, you'll find out why.

537
00:48:50,916 --> 00:48:54,783
One thing about this.
The longer you last, the less you care.

538
00:49:02,135 --> 00:49:04,211
Kay !

539
00:49:20,486 --> 00:49:24,982
You stay out here and keep watch.
If you see or hear anything, whistle.

540
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:44,958
I can't light a fire yet.
They may be around here.

541
00:49:45,052 --> 00:49:48,005
- Indians.
- I know.

542
00:49:48,096 --> 00:49:51,465
They can smell smoke
as far as they can see it.

543
00:49:51,558 --> 00:49:54,594
- I'll be all right.
- Hey, you look fine.

544
00:49:54,686 --> 00:49:56,679
You too.

545
00:49:56,771 --> 00:50:00,555
Now, get out of those clothes
and climb into these blankets.

546
00:50:03,069 --> 00:50:05,145
Here.

547
00:50:17,917 --> 00:50:19,956
I'll wait outside.

548
00:50:20,044 --> 00:50:23,994
Dry yourself with one blanket
and wrap yourself in the other.

549
00:50:31,805 --> 00:50:33,881
- See anything ?
- No.

550
00:50:40,189 --> 00:50:44,269
- Is she going to die ?
- No, she's a strong girl.

551
00:50:44,359 --> 00:50:46,435
She won't die so easy.

552
00:50:47,279 --> 00:50:49,521
But she's awfully sick, isn't she ?

553
00:50:49,614 --> 00:50:52,366
Well, she's cold, exhausted, hungry.

554
00:50:55,954 --> 00:50:59,537
- Will we stay here long ?
- No. We're hungry, too.

555
00:51:01,126 --> 00:51:05,254
You better see if you can scrape up
some wood. Maybe some pine nuts.

556
00:51:05,338 --> 00:51:08,458
We'll have to take a chance on a fire.

557
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:10,626
And be careful.

558
00:51:17,725 --> 00:51:19,801
All right.

559
00:51:55,387 --> 00:51:57,629
It's very fancy for the Northwest.

560
00:52:00,225 --> 00:52:02,301
The Emporium, Kansas City.

561
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,440
Lie down.

562
00:52:18,993 --> 00:52:21,069
Come on ! Come on.

563
00:53:00,408 --> 00:53:02,484
All right. Sit up.

564
00:53:41,448 --> 00:53:43,488
I think you'll live.

565
00:53:43,575 --> 00:53:46,695
I'm sorry I opened my big mouth
in front of the boy.

566
00:53:48,455 --> 00:53:51,456
You hurt me and I wanted to hurt you back.

567
00:53:51,542 --> 00:53:53,618
Well, that's the way it works.

568
00:54:11,394 --> 00:54:15,439
If it wasn't for me,
you'd be halfway to Council City by now.

569
00:54:15,523 --> 00:54:19,391
If it wasn't for Weston,
I'd be asleep in the bunk in my cabin.

570
00:54:39,171 --> 00:54:41,247
Can't you get some sleep ?

571
00:54:42,049 --> 00:54:44,457
Just so he does. That's what matters.

572
00:55:32,515 --> 00:55:36,014
- I don't know what happened to me there.
- You're just hungry.

573
00:55:36,102 --> 00:55:39,186
Sometimes men have eaten
worms and grubs and roots.

574
00:55:39,271 --> 00:55:41,893
- You read that in a book.
- I ate a worm once,

575
00:55:41,982 --> 00:55:44,271
but I was very young then.

576
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,645
Last week in tent city, I ate a sirloin steak.

577
00:55:47,738 --> 00:55:49,814
I was a lot younger then, myself.

578
00:55:51,784 --> 00:55:54,535
He's asleep now.

579
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,945
We'll let him sleep.

580
00:55:57,039 --> 00:55:59,411
It wouldn't be anything if we had a rifle.

581
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:02,999
He'd just hunt something and kill it.
He's a fine shot.

582
00:56:09,426 --> 00:56:11,502
Why did he kill a man ?

583
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:16,006
Sometimes you can't help it.

584
00:56:16,099 --> 00:56:18,672
Sometimes it's to save your own life.

585
00:56:18,768 --> 00:56:20,927
He said it was to save his friend's.

586
00:56:22,021 --> 00:56:24,310
That can be the same as your own.

587
00:56:24,399 --> 00:56:26,557
Then why'd they send him to prison ?

588
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:31,146
It's hard to say.

589
00:56:32,323 --> 00:56:34,399
Because he shot him in the back ?

590
00:56:39,205 --> 00:56:40,580
Kay !

591
00:56:43,084 --> 00:56:45,657
Look, there's two of them !

592
00:56:45,836 --> 00:56:47,912
Wake him ! Wake him up !

593
00:56:50,841 --> 00:56:52,917
Look.

594
00:56:58,098 --> 00:57:00,174
Get the rope.

595
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:15,439
You got him ! You got him !

596
00:57:43,809 --> 00:57:47,677
- Isn't it almost done ?
- Almost.

597
00:57:47,772 --> 00:57:50,642
- Now, where did she go ?
- Her name's Kay.

598
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:54,565
- I know.
- You always say "you" or "her" or "she".

599
00:57:57,031 --> 00:58:00,565
- Why do you hate her ?
- Now, what makes you think I hate her ?

600
00:58:00,659 --> 00:58:04,704
- You treat her bad.
- I treat her like what she is to me: nothing.

601
00:58:05,747 --> 00:58:09,531
Then it's only because you hate him.
The man who stole from us.

602
00:58:09,626 --> 00:58:12,793
- Well, don't you ?
- No.

603
00:58:12,879 --> 00:58:15,038
After what he did to us ?

604
00:58:15,132 --> 00:58:17,338
She said he didn't know any better.

605
00:58:17,425 --> 00:58:21,886
She said that sometimes you do wrong
things that seem all right when you do them.

606
00:58:21,972 --> 00:58:24,509
Like what ?

607
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:26,675
Like what you did.

608
00:58:32,482 --> 00:58:34,558
Are you going to kill him ?

609
00:58:35,943 --> 00:58:38,399
Mark, look.

610
00:58:38,488 --> 00:58:40,445
There's a law.

611
00:58:40,531 --> 00:58:42,607
You can't steal a man's horse.

612
00:58:43,534 --> 00:58:46,535
In this land, that's like stealing his life.

613
00:58:46,621 --> 00:58:50,120
I didn't make the law.
All men make them to live by.

614
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:55,165
What he did to us might have
taken our lives. Still might.

615
00:58:57,339 --> 00:59:01,040
Now, are you gonna tell me
where she went ? Where Kay went ?

616
00:59:01,135 --> 00:59:03,542
She's takin' a bath in the waterfall.

617
00:59:05,973 --> 00:59:08,049
Finish it.

618
00:59:15,482 --> 00:59:18,518
I'd be alive again if I hadn't starved to death.

619
00:59:19,569 --> 00:59:21,443
I see you're still alive.

620
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:25,776
- How was the water ?
- Freezing, but I'm becoming hardened.

621
00:59:25,867 --> 00:59:27,990
I guess it's from seeing life in the raw,

622
00:59:28,078 --> 00:59:31,778
and running around with strong,
silent types like you guys.

623
00:59:31,873 --> 00:59:35,040
Yeah. I'll go get the stuff off the raft.

624
00:59:35,126 --> 00:59:37,202
I'll help you.

625
00:59:38,212 --> 00:59:40,834
- See how I've changed ?
- How would I know ?

626
00:59:41,674 --> 00:59:44,046
You oughta take a dip in the falls yourself.

627
00:59:44,135 --> 00:59:47,551
Might wash some of the starch
out of you, or rust.

628
00:59:47,638 --> 00:59:49,927
- Or whatever it is.
- Or whatever it is.

629
00:59:51,892 --> 00:59:54,644
You're not such a mean person,
in spite of yourself.

630
00:59:54,729 --> 00:59:59,355
Some other time and some other place,
we might have even have gotten along.

631
00:59:59,441 --> 01:00:02,146
Now, what's all this ?
What kind of an act is this ?

632
01:00:02,236 --> 01:00:05,486
I'm a performer. Didn't you know ?
Songs and dances.

633
01:00:05,572 --> 01:00:08,906
- I think I know you pretty well.
- I think I know you, too.

634
01:00:08,992 --> 01:00:11,234
Hm ? What am I like ?

635
01:00:11,328 --> 01:00:13,451
Really not so bad.

636
01:00:13,539 --> 01:00:16,290
Not so tough and grim as you seem.

637
01:00:16,375 --> 01:00:18,747
I think you do a little acting yourself.

638
01:00:18,835 --> 01:00:21,161
You could be nice if you half-tried.

639
01:00:22,214 --> 01:00:25,417
You don't have to hate me
just because you hate him.

640
01:00:25,509 --> 01:00:27,584
I don't hate you.

641
01:00:30,096 --> 01:00:32,587
You'd do anything to save him,
wouldn't you ?

642
01:00:32,682 --> 01:00:35,434
You'd even be... friends.

643
01:00:36,269 --> 01:00:38,807
I could be that without him.

644
01:00:38,897 --> 01:00:40,973
Why ?

645
01:00:43,735 --> 01:00:45,811
Why not ?

646
01:00:53,578 --> 01:00:55,653
Leave me alone !

647
01:01:10,511 --> 01:01:12,587
Let go !

648
01:01:21,897 --> 01:01:23,973
Matt !

649
01:01:59,809 --> 01:02:01,885
He sure wanted that meat.

650
01:02:03,521 --> 01:02:05,976
- Yeah, we're in a hungry world.
- Ain't we.

651
01:02:06,065 --> 01:02:08,900
- You all right ?
- I think so, but you're not.

652
01:02:08,984 --> 01:02:11,273
- Take your shirt off.
- Oh, I'll live.

653
01:02:11,362 --> 01:02:14,113
My name's Benson. This is Dave Colby.

654
01:02:15,532 --> 01:02:16,813
You're a fine shot.

655
01:02:16,909 --> 01:02:19,863
I'm as hungry as that cat.
We ain't eaten for two days.

656
01:02:19,953 --> 01:02:22,623
Well, go ahead and eat.
You earned a piece of it.

657
01:02:22,706 --> 01:02:26,371
We smelled your food.
Had to make sure it wasn't Indians.

658
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:29,833
Left our horses down by the water.

659
01:02:29,921 --> 01:02:32,543
You prospectin' for gold ?

660
01:02:32,632 --> 01:02:37,009
Not any more, mister.
We're prospectin' for a man.

661
01:02:37,095 --> 01:02:39,503
You didn't say who you was.

662
01:02:39,597 --> 01:02:41,673
Calder.

663
01:02:41,766 --> 01:02:45,135
- This here your wife ?
- No.

664
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:47,304
You headed for Council City ?

665
01:02:47,397 --> 01:02:49,804
Yeah, on the river. We got a raft.

666
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:53,233
Ain't that kinda foolish,
with all these Indians ?

667
01:02:53,319 --> 01:02:56,237
- It isn't too bright without them.
- Yeah.

668
01:02:56,322 --> 01:02:58,813
Now I know where I seen you.

669
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:01,577
Same place you left your table manners ?

670
01:03:01,661 --> 01:03:05,741
Same place I left a gold claim
to a card shark named Weston.

671
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:09,121
Wasn't you and him kind of thick ?

672
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:13,159
I can't quite place you.
But then, all the faces look the same.

673
01:03:14,089 --> 01:03:17,209
I heard you and him
pulled out of there, on a raft.

674
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:20,585
Do you know somethin' about this ?

675
01:03:20,679 --> 01:03:22,755
Yeah, that's my trouble.

676
01:03:24,725 --> 01:03:26,883
I know a little about everything.

677
01:03:37,612 --> 01:03:41,028
- What are you doin' with this guy ?
- I want to get away for a while.

678
01:03:41,116 --> 01:03:44,615
Fresh air and relaxation.

679
01:03:44,702 --> 01:03:47,869
Did you dump Weston ? Or did he dump you ?

680
01:03:49,207 --> 01:03:51,496
All right, honey. I'm lookin' for him, too.

681
01:03:51,584 --> 01:03:56,163
Only you try to make Council City on
that raft and you won't get away for a while.

682
01:03:56,255 --> 01:03:58,414
You'll get away for ever.

683
01:03:58,508 --> 01:04:03,134
- You come with us, and you got a chance.
- Oh, we'll get there.

684
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:06,636
You get your belly full of food,
and you're a lover.

685
01:04:06,724 --> 01:04:10,852
Did you hear what I said... honey ?

686
01:04:11,228 --> 01:04:13,304
She heard ya.

687
01:04:16,233 --> 01:04:20,729
Well, ain't she got a right to take
her best chance the way she sees it ?

688
01:04:20,821 --> 01:04:23,442
With us, she's got one.

689
01:04:23,532 --> 01:04:28,443
- You wanna ask me ?
- Go ahead, honey. It's your party.

690
01:04:28,537 --> 01:04:32,237
All right.
I'd rather have no chance... with him.

691
01:04:33,291 --> 01:04:35,331
You heard her.

692
01:04:35,418 --> 01:04:39,499
You and your partner did me a favor, Colby.
Now I'll do one for you.

693
01:04:39,589 --> 01:04:41,665
Just take your meat and get out.

694
01:05:23,716 --> 01:05:25,792
All right, get up.

695
01:05:25,884 --> 01:05:27,960
Get up !

696
01:05:35,227 --> 01:05:37,303
You wanna do what I say ?

697
01:05:41,775 --> 01:05:43,851
Do what he says.

698
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:47,561
Get your horses
and ride them up to that point.

699
01:05:47,656 --> 01:05:49,731
Wait for your friend there.

700
01:05:50,742 --> 01:05:52,818
Do it.

701
01:05:54,662 --> 01:05:57,070
No, leave his rifle. Just take yours.

702
01:05:59,542 --> 01:06:01,618
Do it, Sam.

703
01:06:06,465 --> 01:06:08,672
Thanks for the meat.

704
01:06:08,759 --> 01:06:10,835
Drop your cartridge belt.

705
01:06:17,601 --> 01:06:19,677
Get the stuff aboard.

706
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:28,936
Take that rifle, son.

707
01:06:38,288 --> 01:06:40,364
All right, come on.

708
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,956
What's all this for ?

709
01:06:49,049 --> 01:06:52,215
As soon as he gets to that point,
you can run after him.

710
01:06:52,302 --> 01:06:55,671
- Are you gonna count ?
- I can subtract two men from two horses

711
01:06:55,763 --> 01:06:59,512
and have two horses left for myself,
if you like it better that way.

712
01:06:59,601 --> 01:07:02,554
- You got the knife, Calder.
- I got it from you.

713
01:07:04,772 --> 01:07:06,848
All right. Now you can get out.

714
01:07:08,151 --> 01:07:12,528
I hope this river don't kill you, Calder.
I hope it leaves you for me.

715
01:07:15,658 --> 01:07:17,734
Too crowded around here.

716
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:30,516
I'm not asleep.

717
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,895
Here. Drink this.

718
01:08:34,109 --> 01:08:36,185
Make you feel better.

719
01:08:37,112 --> 01:08:39,152
Careful, that's the last of it.

720
01:08:39,239 --> 01:08:41,695
Is that all it's the last of ?

721
01:08:41,783 --> 01:08:43,859
Drink it.

722
01:08:49,124 --> 01:08:51,200
I'll split it with you.

723
01:08:53,044 --> 01:08:55,203
I get everybody into trouble.

724
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:57,373
You mean Colby ?

725
01:08:57,465 --> 01:09:01,333
You couldn't help that.
You'll never be able to help that.

726
01:09:01,428 --> 01:09:03,669
Besides, it isn't you. It's the gold.

727
01:09:03,763 --> 01:09:07,630
It made a thief of Weston,
a pig out of Colby and a fool of you.

728
01:09:09,268 --> 01:09:11,344
One thing about you, though.

729
01:09:11,437 --> 01:09:14,391
You get somebody in trouble,
you get right in it with 'em.

730
01:09:14,482 --> 01:09:17,566
Only trouble should get you somewhere.

731
01:09:17,652 --> 01:09:22,610
- It never gets me anything.
- Sure it does. It gets you more of the same.

732
01:09:22,698 --> 01:09:24,857
Not some people.

733
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:26,990
- You mean Weston ?
- Yes.

734
01:09:27,077 --> 01:09:29,913
He's going to get someplace,
no matter what it takes.

735
01:09:29,997 --> 01:09:33,033
- Is that why you married him ?
- What do you care ?

736
01:09:34,168 --> 01:09:36,244
You lose your ring ?

737
01:09:37,379 --> 01:09:40,546
You know everything, don't you ?
Like the kid says.

738
01:09:40,632 --> 01:09:42,708
It's nothing to me.

739
01:09:44,678 --> 01:09:46,884
No. We're not married.

740
01:09:46,972 --> 01:09:49,463
We were gonna be married in Council City.

741
01:09:49,558 --> 01:09:51,965
We're never gonna get there, are we ?

742
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:54,218
Like you said, who gets anywhere ?

743
01:09:57,065 --> 01:10:00,315
The boy's asleep. You can tell me now.

744
01:10:01,236 --> 01:10:03,643
I would have said we'd never get here.

745
01:10:05,782 --> 01:10:07,858
Finish it.

746
01:10:11,454 --> 01:10:13,530
You're a strange man.

747
01:10:14,374 --> 01:10:16,781
Sometimes not like a man at all.

748
01:10:16,876 --> 01:10:19,877
- Like an animal ?
- No, I didn't mean that.

749
01:10:19,962 --> 01:10:22,287
I didn't mean it either, back there.

750
01:10:25,343 --> 01:10:28,676
You know, you're sort of
on the strange side yourself.

751
01:10:28,763 --> 01:10:32,131
You'd have been surer
of getting to Council City with Colby.

752
01:10:32,224 --> 01:10:34,798
Why didn't you go with him ?

753
01:10:34,894 --> 01:10:37,645
You have to ask ? A man like that ?

754
01:10:38,147 --> 01:10:40,816
Well, what's a man like Weston ?

755
01:10:40,899 --> 01:10:44,849
How would you know ?
How would you know anything about him ?

756
01:10:44,945 --> 01:10:47,732
What he wanted all of his life,
or what he's been ?

757
01:10:47,823 --> 01:10:50,859
You only know the one thing he did to you.

758
01:10:50,951 --> 01:10:54,154
The one crazy thing,
because he was desperate.

759
01:10:54,246 --> 01:10:56,737
- About a hunk of gold.
- About his life !

760
01:10:57,666 --> 01:11:02,162
You can't even see the difference
between him and that man back there.

761
01:11:47,631 --> 01:11:49,707
Are they waiting for us ?

762
01:11:51,051 --> 01:11:53,127
The fish have a better chance.

763
01:11:54,513 --> 01:11:56,007
Or him.

764
01:12:02,896 --> 01:12:05,303
Why can't they get along without us ?

765
01:12:05,398 --> 01:12:07,474
They just wanna make sure of it.

766
01:12:09,569 --> 01:12:13,270
- Did you see 'em ?
- I saw the one with the man's horse.

767
01:12:13,364 --> 01:12:15,440
- What man ?
- Colby.

768
01:12:16,451 --> 01:12:19,024
Those birds.

769
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,528
- They're buzzards ?
- Yeah.

770
01:12:21,622 --> 01:12:23,662
Look !

771
01:12:28,421 --> 01:12:30,662
Can they come down ?

772
01:12:30,756 --> 01:12:35,003
As soon as they find the right place.
They'll know where it is.

773
01:12:40,015 --> 01:12:42,091
Hand me that rifle, son.

774
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:29,846
Look out !

775
01:14:29,789 --> 01:14:31,912
Matt ! Over there !

776
01:14:37,797 --> 01:14:39,873
Give me the rifle.

777
01:14:45,763 --> 01:14:47,839
It's all gone !

778
01:15:37,605 --> 01:15:39,681
Get the rope !

779
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:21,640
Well, there it is. That's Council City.

780
01:18:29,481 --> 01:18:34,356
- What do you want when we get there ?
- A cup of coffee. A whole cup for myself.

781
01:18:34,444 --> 01:18:36,520
You've got it.

782
01:18:37,447 --> 01:18:39,570
What do you want ?

783
01:18:39,657 --> 01:18:42,741
- You're still going after him, aren't you ?
- You know that.

784
01:18:42,827 --> 01:18:45,994
- Nothing I could say would change it.
- Nothing.

785
01:18:47,874 --> 01:18:51,823
Then I want one thing.
Let me find him first and talk to him.

786
01:18:53,045 --> 01:18:56,081
Let me see him alone and explain.
That isn't much, is it ?

787
01:18:56,173 --> 01:18:58,380
It might be all he needs.

788
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:00,626
Just a few minutes, a little time.

789
01:19:07,351 --> 01:19:09,427
All right, Kay. You've got it.

790
01:19:35,128 --> 01:19:38,164
- You never believed we would make it.
- Not very often.

791
01:19:38,256 --> 01:19:43,961
I knew you would. I knew that if a man hated
as much as you did, he could do anything.

792
01:19:44,053 --> 01:19:46,212
- Or loved as much.
- Loved what ?

793
01:19:46,305 --> 01:19:51,644
Him. It was for him. Not for a horse
or a gun or the man who took them.

794
01:19:51,727 --> 01:19:56,722
That's just how it began.
I guess that must be the best thing there is.

795
01:19:56,816 --> 01:19:59,935
- What ?
- To be loved that much.

796
01:20:00,027 --> 01:20:02,103
Look ! Here's our horse !

797
01:20:06,992 --> 01:20:09,993
- Well, it looks like he's here.
- I was hoping he wasn't.

798
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:13,364
- I was hoping he'd gone back to your place.
- No chance.

799
01:20:13,457 --> 01:20:16,411
- But why did he stay here ?
- Because he knew I'd never make it.

800
01:20:16,501 --> 01:20:17,746
Matt Calder !

801
01:20:17,836 --> 01:20:22,047
I thought you was down there on your farm...
with a tomahawk in your head.

802
01:20:22,132 --> 01:20:25,750
No, I like to keep my head.
It's about the only thing I've got left.

803
01:20:25,844 --> 01:20:28,133
That's a fine animal. Who belongs to it ?

804
01:20:28,221 --> 01:20:30,297
Fella named Weston.

805
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:33,723
- Where can I find him ?
- Across the street at the Black Nugget.

806
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:37,309
Say, you look like
you could stand a shot yourself.

807
01:20:37,397 --> 01:20:39,722
No, but we could use some coffee.
You got any ?

808
01:20:39,816 --> 01:20:42,936
Got everything but pt de foie gras.
Come on in.

809
01:20:46,114 --> 01:20:49,150
- He's at the Black Nugget.
- Yes.

810
01:20:49,242 --> 01:20:52,159
- Don't be too long.
- No.

811
01:20:52,245 --> 01:20:55,827
Tell him I'm here.
He can run but he can't hide.

812
01:20:55,915 --> 01:21:00,541
He won't run. Just talk to him.
Give yourself a chance to find out.

813
01:21:00,628 --> 01:21:02,704
I'm giving you the chance.

814
01:21:06,508 --> 01:21:08,964
Where's she going ?

815
01:21:09,053 --> 01:21:12,089
She'll be back.
Come on. Let's get that coffee.

816
01:21:40,417 --> 01:21:41,875
Kay ! Honey !

817
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:44,629
Why didn't you start back, Harry ?

818
01:21:44,712 --> 01:21:47,713
I thought I was doing pretty good
just to make it to here.

819
01:21:47,799 --> 01:21:49,875
Have a seat.

820
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:53,965
How'd you get here ?

821
01:21:54,055 --> 01:21:56,427
- Calder ?
- Yes.

822
01:21:56,516 --> 01:22:00,050
- All right. Where is he ?
- He's at the store having coffee.

823
01:22:00,144 --> 01:22:03,061
- He's waiting.
- For me ?

824
01:22:03,147 --> 01:22:05,223
For us.

825
01:22:06,275 --> 01:22:08,517
He let me see you alone first.

826
01:22:08,611 --> 01:22:10,852
First ? Before what ?

827
01:22:10,946 --> 01:22:13,318
You oughta know by now.

828
01:22:13,407 --> 01:22:15,898
- Would you like something ?
- No.

829
01:22:15,993 --> 01:22:18,069
Nothing, Jack.

830
01:22:18,162 --> 01:22:20,617
Well, what's there to talk about ?

831
01:22:20,706 --> 01:22:22,947
He could have you hanged for what you did.

832
01:22:23,041 --> 01:22:25,615
He could kill you
and nobody would blame him.

833
01:22:25,711 --> 01:22:27,086
I might.

834
01:22:27,170 --> 01:22:31,963
I told him why you did it, what it was
that made both of us the way we were.

835
01:22:32,968 --> 01:22:35,340
I think he believed me at last.

836
01:22:35,428 --> 01:22:38,465
Now it's up to you. You have to tell him, too.

837
01:22:38,556 --> 01:22:42,091
- Tell him what ?
- The truth, Harry.

838
01:22:42,185 --> 01:22:46,396
That you were desperate. That you
didn't mean to harm him or the boy.

839
01:22:46,481 --> 01:22:49,766
What makes you think he'll listen to me ?

840
01:22:49,859 --> 01:22:53,643
Because of the kind of man he is,
and because of the boy.

841
01:22:54,697 --> 01:22:56,773
Or because of you ?

842
01:22:58,326 --> 01:23:00,698
Look, honey. I got the claim filed.

843
01:23:00,786 --> 01:23:03,491
We can get rich and get outta here for ever.

844
01:23:04,999 --> 01:23:09,826
Unless you were thinking you two
could hang me and have the claim together ?

845
01:23:11,839 --> 01:23:13,915
I didn't mean that, honey.

846
01:23:16,427 --> 01:23:19,427
I mean that all my life I've been nothing.

847
01:23:19,513 --> 01:23:22,300
A drifter, a cheater, a tinhorn.

848
01:23:22,391 --> 01:23:26,969
All my life, I waited for the one
big chance a man gets, and this is mine.

849
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:31,315
I'm not gonna lose it or risk it
or go back to being what I was before,

850
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:34,982
or get strung up just because
some dirt farmer wants his horse back.

851
01:23:35,070 --> 01:23:36,694
That's what I mean.

852
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:38,856
All right, Kay, I'll talk to him.

853
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:43,820
- What's that for ?
- In case he's hard of hearing.

854
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:52,283
All right, Kay. Any way you want it.

855
01:23:52,962 --> 01:23:55,370
Too bad about your place, Matt.

856
01:23:55,465 --> 01:23:59,593
Bad for me, good for you, Ben.
It all depends on whose ox gets gold.

857
01:24:00,553 --> 01:24:04,882
- What'll you need ?
- Just about everything my credit'll stand.

858
01:24:04,974 --> 01:24:07,547
- Take what you want.
- Thanks.

859
01:24:09,562 --> 01:24:12,479
They're all kinda crazy, ain't they ?

860
01:24:12,565 --> 01:24:15,056
- What's that, Ben ?
- The times.

861
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:18,685
White men chasin' gold.
Indians chasin' white men.

862
01:24:18,779 --> 01:24:20,855
Army chasin' the Indians.

863
01:24:26,662 --> 01:24:28,738
If you like that rifle, keep it.

864
01:24:41,468 --> 01:24:43,544
What are you chasin', Matt ?

865
01:24:45,305 --> 01:24:49,682
Don't try to buy him, Harry. Don't offer
him anything. Just tell him the truth.

866
01:24:49,768 --> 01:24:51,844
Are you listening to me, Harry ?

867
01:24:56,441 --> 01:24:58,517
Harry, no !

868
01:25:41,234 --> 01:25:44,188
I... I... I had to !

869
01:25:45,322 --> 01:25:48,109
It's all right, Mark. It's all right.

870
01:25:49,409 --> 01:25:52,196
You saw it ! You know.

871
01:25:52,287 --> 01:25:55,738
There was no other way, Mark.
It was him or your dad.

872
01:26:47,883 --> 01:26:51,251
- Where's she goin' ?
- I don't know.

873
01:26:51,344 --> 01:26:53,966
- Is she goin' away now ?
- I don't know.

874
01:27:16,077 --> 01:27:18,864
