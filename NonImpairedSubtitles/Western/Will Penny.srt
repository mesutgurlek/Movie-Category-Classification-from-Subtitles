1
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,057
Damn you, Will Penny!

2
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:08,648
Steal my biscuits
and bring me no firewood!

3
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,025
What the hell's got into you?

4
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:16,653
Them biscuits ain't for you to steal.
They ain't to be ate till I say so.

5
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,571
Now, come on, give 'em back.

6
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,496
At least give me some coffee.

7
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,873
Bring me some firewood.

8
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:37,177
Go on. Pot ain't boiled yet anyhow.

9
00:02:06,796 --> 00:02:12,135
Chuck! Come and get it,
you cow-nurses, or I'll throw it out!

10
00:02:12,302 --> 00:02:16,051
- Chuck's on!
- Come on out, boys.

11
00:02:18,017 --> 00:02:20,590
Get outta those blankets, damn you!

12
00:02:56,474 --> 00:03:00,768
- Wearing snowshoes, Bo?
- You've been walkin' on my feet.

13
00:03:00,937 --> 00:03:05,895
Old man like you belongs at the end
of the line. We do all the work.

14
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:11,406
I'm surprised you got this far.
You earned yourself a warm corner.

15
00:03:13,617 --> 00:03:15,906
That's enough, Shorthorn.

16
00:03:16,078 --> 00:03:21,073
Was you about to do something?
'Cause I'd sure clean your plough.

17
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:46,518
- Whoa!
- Ride him!

18
00:03:56,787 --> 00:04:00,073
You stupid, jug-head bastard!

19
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:03,953
Last day. Make it a good one.

20
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:07,295
Get there today
and you make your bonus.

21
00:04:07,465 --> 00:04:12,590
Get where? Ain't a bottle of whisky
or a town inside a week of here.

22
00:04:12,762 --> 00:04:16,214
Save your money!
Get a spread of your own, like me.

23
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:20,638
- Money didn't get you into cattle.
- No? What did, Will?

24
00:04:20,812 --> 00:04:24,146
More like a long rope and a hot iron.

25
00:04:24,316 --> 00:04:26,392
Let's go!

26
00:05:11,908 --> 00:05:17,781
Don't be afraid to ask for help
when you need it, old man.

27
00:05:17,956 --> 00:05:20,708
It's time you did something, Will.

28
00:05:20,876 --> 00:05:23,581
Fightin' don't get the work done.

29
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:17,216
- Something chasing you, Dutchy?
- If the augur sees you, he'll get mad.

30
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:21,723
Ja. I see where they're taking us.
Nowhere, that's where.

31
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:24,733
Nowhere at all!

32
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:41,539
Who figures it out
they put a spur there? What for?

33
00:06:41,711 --> 00:06:47,999
Everybody trying to get ahead.
Train company wants to get to the cows.

34
00:06:48,176 --> 00:06:52,126
Anse wants to get to market first,
to get top price.

35
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:55,140
And the poor cow-hand rides drag.

36
00:06:55,308 --> 00:06:58,345
- Better than pushin' a plough.
- Ja.

37
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,789
Down steer!

38
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,091
Bigfoot! Comin' a-runnin'!

39
00:07:45,152 --> 00:07:48,153
He busted my damn leg!

40
00:08:02,587 --> 00:08:06,751
- Gimme some air, boys.
- Stand back, boys.

41
00:08:16,268 --> 00:08:19,472
She's busted, all right.
Grab a hold of this.

42
00:08:19,647 --> 00:08:23,016
- Here.
- You've been holding out on us.

43
00:08:23,192 --> 00:08:27,190
That stuff's for doctoring, not drinking.
Hang on to him.

44
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:32,692
That's enough.

45
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,531
- Feels like it's smashed to pieces.
- He'll go to Kansas City with us.

46
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:42,541
He'll get a doctor there
and his train ticket home.

47
00:08:42,713 --> 00:08:47,090
What if he can't work
for you no more, Anse?

48
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:51,672
That's the fall of the cards.
He'll get a job some place.

49
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:57,304
Ike, how did you manage that?
Real slop. But that's the way I like it.

50
00:08:57,478 --> 00:08:58,937
You do the cooking.

51
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:04,313
I'll get a job where the horse
has the brains and does all the work.

52
00:09:06,405 --> 00:09:10,189
Well, look who's here.
Where you been hidin', Grandpa?

53
00:09:11,577 --> 00:09:14,447
Might not be good, but it's hot!

54
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,339
- You ain't fightin' proper!
- You're the one that's down.

55
00:09:32,515 --> 00:09:39,183
I told you that leaky mouth
would jump up on you, Boetius!

56
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:46,477
- Won't you fight with these?
- My hands are for working.

57
00:09:46,655 --> 00:09:53,619
If the Lord wanted men to fight like dogs,
He'd've give 'em teeth and claws.

58
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:58,573
He's younger than you figure,
ain't it, sonny?

59
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:03,918
You go to your gun,
I'll hang you right here!

60
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:13,672
- You boys wanna fight, or get paid?
- Get paid!

61
00:10:15,602 --> 00:10:20,728
- If you can't write, make your mark.
- I went to four grades of school!

62
00:10:35,415 --> 00:10:39,662
- Want your train ticket?
- Don't need it. Got my wagon.

63
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:42,837
Move on. Let the next man in.

64
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,922
You can't cowboy as good as you write.
Ticket?

65
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:56,726
No ticket for me.
I think I ride along with Blue.

66
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:34,890
- What's your whole name, Will?
- Penny. Will Penny.

67
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:38,683
- You got any family?
- No.

68
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:40,933
Another job to go to?

69
00:11:41,109 --> 00:11:44,858
This time of year?
You know better than that.

70
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,241
You're a good steady hand.
You can be bull-nurse with me.

71
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:53,657
Wait here for the train
and ride to Kansas City.

72
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:56,203
Sure thing.

73
00:12:01,172 --> 00:12:04,707
Mr Howard. Can I go with you
to Kansas City?

74
00:12:04,884 --> 00:12:10,009
- You wanna see the elephant?
- Naw, hell. I've been there before.

75
00:12:10,181 --> 00:12:14,131
My pa lives there.
He's gettin' pretty old.

76
00:12:14,311 --> 00:12:20,100
If I don't see him on this trip,
I won't see him again at all.

77
00:12:21,652 --> 00:12:24,855
I already got Will Penny.

78
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:30,191
If you wanna go, you've got
more than enough to get there.

79
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:34,118
Well, you're a fair man, Mr Howard.

80
00:12:37,043 --> 00:12:39,332
I'll see you punchers some time.

81
00:12:39,504 --> 00:12:44,000
- Ever been to K.C.?
- No. I guess I'll see the elephant.

82
00:12:44,175 --> 00:12:46,002
Ja!

83
00:12:54,645 --> 00:12:57,017
Wiedersehen, Will.

84
00:12:57,189 --> 00:13:00,641
- Will. I gotta talk with you.
- Sure.

85
00:13:00,818 --> 00:13:03,226
It's about my pa.

86
00:13:03,404 --> 00:13:07,616
- So long, Anse.
- So long, Bo.

87
00:13:07,783 --> 00:13:10,738
Damn haul gets longer every year.

88
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:16,908
See you back in cactus country.

89
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:22,246
I don't know, Bigfoot.
It puts me out of a job mighty sudden.

90
00:13:22,424 --> 00:13:26,636
- North of here, Flatiron might be hiring.
- In the winter?

91
00:13:26,803 --> 00:13:31,015
I wouldn't lie to you, honest.
Hold on... Look...

92
00:13:31,183 --> 00:13:34,635
I'll give you some of my pay.
Twenty dollars!

93
00:13:34,812 --> 00:13:37,647
Which one of you is coming with me?

94
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:42,193
Aw hell, go on, then.

95
00:13:42,362 --> 00:13:46,312
Gimme ten dollars
so I don't feel like a damn fool.

96
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:50,904
- Me, Mr Howard, if it's OK.
- Come on.

97
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:53,368
- Much obliged, Will.
- Yeah.

98
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,844
You fellas got room for one more hand?

99
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,930
So long, boys!

100
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:23,152
So long, boys!

101
00:14:48,932 --> 00:14:52,764
Hey, Blue. Come on, wake up.

102
00:14:56,481 --> 00:15:01,024
I bet there's some place
in this wilderness they got whisky.

103
00:15:01,194 --> 00:15:05,572
- And beds.
- I forgot what it tastes like.

104
00:15:05,741 --> 00:15:09,525
And a bath. I think I got bugs.

105
00:15:09,703 --> 00:15:12,621
Just one shot.

106
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:17,244
I hope we can find us a job.

107
00:15:18,337 --> 00:15:24,672
Not the three of us together. Ain't no
place they hire three hands in winter.

108
00:15:24,844 --> 00:15:29,056
One job's all I need.
Sharing a blanket don't make us married.

109
00:15:29,224 --> 00:15:33,269
Will, I think he'll find
that Flatiron spread to hire on.

110
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:41,692
It's a damned good thing he can cowboy,
'cause he sure can't navigate.

111
00:15:41,862 --> 00:15:44,780
It ain't hot yet.

112
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:48,659
Come on! Go and get the water!

113
00:15:51,122 --> 00:15:53,198
All right.

114
00:16:19,151 --> 00:16:25,071
- What the hell...?
- It's an elk! Fresh meat!

115
00:17:02,948 --> 00:17:06,364
Hey! Good shot, Blue. You got him.

116
00:17:06,576 --> 00:17:10,906
- But I didn't. Didn't you?
- Didn't I...?

117
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,749
Ja. I shot him with my knife.

118
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:21,003
- Let's move him.
- Or somebody gonna be mad.

119
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:23,845
Madder than a stud at gelding time.

120
00:17:39,152 --> 00:17:41,904
Careful. They got the sun on us.

121
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:47,743
Rawhiders.

122
00:17:48,871 --> 00:17:51,362
Ja. It's bad business.

123
00:17:53,626 --> 00:17:57,209
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

124
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:03,750
Name's Quint. Preacher Quint.
These here are my boys.

125
00:18:03,928 --> 00:18:07,677
Mighty nice of you
mindin' that elk for us.

126
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:12,143
We can clean it up ourselves.

127
00:18:12,312 --> 00:18:15,397
Rafe, here, handles a knife just fine.

128
00:18:15,607 --> 00:18:17,849
We give them the elk, ja?

129
00:18:18,027 --> 00:18:22,819
We were onto it first.
Next thing, they'll want our breeches.

130
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,528
Come on, Papa. Let's kill 'em.

131
00:18:25,701 --> 00:18:30,909
We seen a whole camp back there.
Where's the rest of the party?

132
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,866
My shot brought it down.

133
00:18:34,043 --> 00:18:37,792
- Maybe we split 'im up with you.
- Shut up, Dutchy.

134
00:18:37,964 --> 00:18:42,792
Well, now. That's better.
There's five of us.

135
00:18:42,969 --> 00:18:45,176
Countin' my woman.

136
00:18:45,347 --> 00:18:48,265
However many there is of you,

137
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:52,894
if you was only two,
that elk might be enough to go round.

138
00:18:53,063 --> 00:18:58,936
We'll work it out that way.
Then we all go away friends, ja?

139
00:18:59,111 --> 00:19:01,816
There's more of us. But we'll make do.

140
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:08,158
I don't see no more of you.
Maybe you're saying that to trick us.

141
00:19:08,329 --> 00:19:13,953
Or maybe you're saying that
because you know that elk is ours.

142
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:20,959
And you're scared because the Lord
don't side with them that lies and steals.

143
00:19:21,135 --> 00:19:23,839
The Lord sides with the righteous.

144
00:19:24,013 --> 00:19:27,179
If you go away,
maybe the Lord will go easy

145
00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:30,719
and forget you tried to rob folk
of what's theirs.

146
00:19:33,648 --> 00:19:35,356
Walk away in peace.

147
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:40,401
- We leave them the damn elk!
- If they let us.

148
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:23,320
They killed Romulus!

149
00:20:42,804 --> 00:20:45,176
Beware the wrath of the Lord!

150
00:20:45,348 --> 00:20:49,298
He strikes down
them that have blood on their hands.

151
00:20:49,478 --> 00:20:52,763
He punisheth the sinner.

152
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:56,558
Life for life.

153
00:20:56,735 --> 00:20:59,855
Eye for eye.

154
00:21:00,948 --> 00:21:03,154
Tooth for tooth.

155
00:21:03,951 --> 00:21:06,786
Burnin' for burnin'.

156
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,870
Wound for wound.

157
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,995
Stripe for stripe.

158
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:18,499
Who sheddeth man's blood,

159
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:22,293
by man shall his blood be shed.

160
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:31,306
You ain't seen the last of me!

161
00:21:38,362 --> 00:21:40,438
Blue!

162
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:50,405
- Dutchy, what's wrong?
- I'm shot.

163
00:21:53,712 --> 00:22:00,925
I think maybe I done it to myself.
I couldn't get the gun out of my pocket.

164
00:22:05,808 --> 00:22:08,762
Don't you move. We'll get the wagon.

165
00:22:08,936 --> 00:22:11,012
Blue!

166
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:15,351
- Don't forget the elk.
- Yeah.

167
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:34,077
Hey! Pig, pig, pig...

168
00:23:05,871 --> 00:23:08,658
Is there a doctor nearby?
A man's hurt.

169
00:23:08,832 --> 00:23:11,952
- Come in. Maybe I can help.
- No, thank you.

170
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,583
Isn't there a damn doctor close?

171
00:23:14,755 --> 00:23:19,382
About a half day's fast ride up the road.
Town of... Alfred.

172
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:25,223
If you're bad enough to see a doctor,
time you get there it's too late anyway.

173
00:23:25,392 --> 00:23:29,603
- How bad's your friend hurt?
- Bad. He's gut-shot.

174
00:23:29,771 --> 00:23:33,639
Belly-shot out here?
He's a dead man for certain.

175
00:23:33,817 --> 00:23:37,067
He'll bleed to hell
before he gets to Alfred.

176
00:23:37,571 --> 00:23:42,447
Hello. Name's Catron. Place is mine.

177
00:23:42,618 --> 00:23:45,536
Got some good whisky inside.

178
00:23:55,089 --> 00:23:58,755
Best to make him rest easy
while he waits for the end.

179
00:23:58,927 --> 00:24:02,426
Anything he drinks, on the house.
Bury him out back.

180
00:24:02,597 --> 00:24:08,054
I'll carve him a nice head-marker.
Twenty-five dollars sound about right?

181
00:24:08,228 --> 00:24:10,933
You sound almighty sure he's gonna die.

182
00:24:11,106 --> 00:24:15,982
Sure, I'm sure. Best to face these things
so you can make plans.

183
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:23,739
Dutchy? How are you makin' out?

184
00:24:23,911 --> 00:24:27,245
Oh, Will... It hurts like hell.

185
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:32,710
- We'll go on.
- Hey, Will...

186
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:38,218
Maybe he's right, what he said...
that I die before we get there.

187
00:24:38,385 --> 00:24:40,259
No, hell...

188
00:24:41,388 --> 00:24:47,806
We have waited a long time
for a drink of whisky, ja?

189
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:52,555
Here is the last place
before that town, and...

190
00:24:53,651 --> 00:24:57,435
...you know, maybe I'll never get there.

191
00:24:57,614 --> 00:25:01,742
Will... l'd like to have a sure drink here.

192
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:05,195
Better than a maybe drink later on.

193
00:25:09,084 --> 00:25:12,370
It couldn't hurt so much, one drink.

194
00:25:17,426 --> 00:25:19,004
Come on!

195
00:25:19,178 --> 00:25:24,765
Yes, sir! Planning means a man
don't get any unhappy surprises.

196
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:29,228
Take your friend. You know,
and he knows, he's gonna die.

197
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:32,683
You don't have to fight over his goods.
Take that coat,

198
00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:38,980
for a coat like that,
I'd give a man five, six dollars.

199
00:25:39,157 --> 00:25:41,233
- You...!
- Will!

200
00:25:53,506 --> 00:25:56,626
Give us a bottle and three glasses.

201
00:26:02,682 --> 00:26:05,434
Can you pay?

202
00:26:06,227 --> 00:26:09,810
You got more guts
than a man could hang on a fence.

203
00:26:09,981 --> 00:26:12,057
We can pay.

204
00:26:33,256 --> 00:26:35,462
How's she taste?

205
00:26:36,634 --> 00:26:40,798
Damned if I know.
But it sure burns a dollar's worth.

206
00:26:49,189 --> 00:26:51,265
Good, ain't it?

207
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,575
Ma!

208
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:16,127
- Ma!
- HG, don't shout. I can hear you.

209
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:20,381
There's a man, he's hurt.
He's lying there in a wagon.

210
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:23,343
- Is he alive?
- Sure is.

211
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:28,512
He's cussing something awful,
some words I never even heard before.

212
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,786
You have to get to a doctor, immediately.

213
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:50,908
Too late for a doctor. No...

214
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:54,872
...l'm just a dying cowboy.

215
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:59,297
Well... There must be
something I can do.

216
00:28:01,057 --> 00:28:04,841
Lf, maybe, you could...

217
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,352
...hold my hand?
- Of course.

218
00:28:11,734 --> 00:28:15,946
- You're an angel, lady.
- Tell me, how did it happen?

219
00:28:18,033 --> 00:28:20,405
Wild Indians they was, lady.

220
00:28:20,577 --> 00:28:24,077
Maybe... fifty.

221
00:28:24,248 --> 00:28:28,162
My friends ran away
and left me to fight them off.

222
00:28:28,335 --> 00:28:31,835
Why, the cowards! That's terrible!

223
00:28:32,006 --> 00:28:36,051
Ja, that's right. Them bummers.

224
00:28:36,219 --> 00:28:39,919
They wait until them Indians
is all finished,

225
00:28:40,098 --> 00:28:43,930
then they come back, and bring me here.

226
00:28:44,978 --> 00:28:47,267
Here you go, Dutchy.

227
00:28:51,318 --> 00:28:53,275
Thanks, Will.

228
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:57,279
Least I can do
after you killed all them Indians.

229
00:28:57,491 --> 00:29:02,319
Are you one of the men, his friends,
who left him to the savages?

230
00:29:02,496 --> 00:29:06,079
- We surely did.
- You call yourself a man?

231
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:11,493
You call yourself his friend
and then you do this to him.

232
00:29:11,672 --> 00:29:18,210
If I were you, I'd never speak...
I would never speak to them again.

233
00:29:18,388 --> 00:29:21,093
Ja. Maybe I won't.

234
00:29:21,975 --> 00:29:27,218
I cannot comprehend behaviour
like yours, I simply can't.

235
00:29:28,774 --> 00:29:34,777
It's easy to figure, ma'am.
We just ain't as brave as him.

236
00:29:35,656 --> 00:29:38,491
Dutchy's... plumb brave.

237
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:42,325
Yes. And you leave him
to die in the cold.

238
00:29:42,497 --> 00:29:45,118
At least bring him inside.

239
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:51,246
That won't help him,
juggling that bullet around in his innards.

240
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,001
Is that going to help him?

241
00:29:56,178 --> 00:30:01,469
It may not put him back on his feet
but it won't put him in his grave either.

242
00:30:06,397 --> 00:30:09,564
Is there anything more I can do
to help you?

243
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,148
No.

244
00:30:28,086 --> 00:30:31,586
Hey, Will.

245
00:30:31,757 --> 00:30:35,292
What he said, that... Schwein...

246
00:30:35,469 --> 00:30:39,384
...is he right, do you think?

247
00:30:41,475 --> 00:30:45,520
- I will die?
- It happens to all of us, Dutchy.

248
00:30:45,688 --> 00:30:48,144
No, Will. You know what I mean.

249
00:30:51,152 --> 00:30:53,359
Is now my time?

250
00:30:54,823 --> 00:30:57,444
We'll get you to that doctor.

251
00:30:57,617 --> 00:31:01,615
I don't know, Dutchy.
How the hell do I know?

252
00:31:03,457 --> 00:31:07,407
There's a lot I ain't done yet.
Cowboyin' around.

253
00:31:09,463 --> 00:31:11,290
Hurts like hell.

254
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,972
- I'll get you another drink.
- Will?

255
00:31:19,891 --> 00:31:22,429
I'm only 27 years old.

256
00:31:36,491 --> 00:31:39,030
- Want part of the bet?
- What bet?

257
00:31:39,203 --> 00:31:42,987
He bet 50 dollars Dutchy
don't make it to... Where's it?

258
00:31:43,165 --> 00:31:45,621
- Alfred.
- Want some of that?

259
00:31:45,793 --> 00:31:48,118
- All you got.
- Another 50!

260
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:53,124
- You got a bet.
- Let's drink on it, like gentlemen.

261
00:31:53,301 --> 00:31:56,218
How do you know what gentlemen do?

262
00:32:09,985 --> 00:32:12,108
Mr Bodine.

263
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:20,699
Mr Bodine, you promised to get us
to California before winter set in.

264
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:26,376
- That's what my husband paid you for.
- Yes, ma'am. He sure did.

265
00:32:29,506 --> 00:32:34,547
As soon as you finish that plate,
we're leaving. Is that clear?

266
00:32:34,761 --> 00:32:36,137
Yes, ma'am.

267
00:32:47,942 --> 00:32:51,987
Let's have another bottle.
One of them St Louis ones.

268
00:33:02,082 --> 00:33:05,949
- Mr Bodine!
- That'll be three dollars, ma'am.

269
00:33:23,396 --> 00:33:25,721
Hurry up, HG.

270
00:33:36,409 --> 00:33:39,909
Get your stockings.

271
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,081
Hold on.

272
00:34:03,813 --> 00:34:07,645
- What do you think, Will?
- About what?

273
00:34:07,817 --> 00:34:10,190
About Dutchy.

274
00:34:13,323 --> 00:34:15,861
- You known him a long time?
- No.

275
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,781
- Why did you bet?
- Why did you?

276
00:34:27,713 --> 00:34:32,791
We been working the same outfits,
three, four years running.

277
00:34:34,762 --> 00:34:38,712
He's a good old boy.

278
00:34:38,892 --> 00:34:42,142
And this ain't a good way for him to go.

279
00:34:43,021 --> 00:34:47,268
I'll tell you Blue,
there ain't no good way to go.

280
00:34:47,901 --> 00:34:50,571
Let's drink up and get outta here.

281
00:35:17,474 --> 00:35:19,799
- Sonny?
- Yes, sir?

282
00:35:19,977 --> 00:35:22,646
- Where's the doctor?
- Doctor?

283
00:35:22,813 --> 00:35:28,852
- They said you got a doctor here.
- Down the street. The barber's shop.

284
00:35:29,028 --> 00:35:32,112
Where it says "Post Office".

285
00:35:52,052 --> 00:35:55,219
Doctor? There's a man hurt out here.

286
00:35:58,434 --> 00:36:02,052
How about it? He's bad shot.

287
00:36:02,229 --> 00:36:06,144
Shot, hell.
He's damn near frozen to death.

288
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:14,565
He smells like a still.
Did you stop off on the way to celebrate?

289
00:36:15,618 --> 00:36:20,861
Slow and easy. If you move too fast,
they might miss something.

290
00:36:24,002 --> 00:36:26,458
Over there on the couch.

291
00:36:30,426 --> 00:36:33,546
Better go home, John. I'll finish you later.

292
00:36:49,571 --> 00:36:55,241
If I want any help, I'll send for you.
You can go home now.

293
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:13,335
Mattie! I'll need you.

294
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:24,982
You must have taken
your own sweet time getting here.

295
00:37:26,443 --> 00:37:29,444
This is my wife, Mrs Fraker.

296
00:37:29,613 --> 00:37:31,771
I don't know their names.

297
00:37:33,534 --> 00:37:38,410
If we straighten him out too fast,
he'll break, he's that cold.

298
00:37:38,581 --> 00:37:42,792
Let's warm him up,
and then get his clothes off.

299
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:52,257
Why don't you boys go to the hotel,
get yourselves a bath?

300
00:37:52,429 --> 00:37:54,967
Come back tomorrow morning.

301
00:38:06,068 --> 00:38:09,936
Children. Dangerous children.

302
00:38:18,414 --> 00:38:22,626
- But it's so early!
- Early, hell. The sun's up.

303
00:38:22,794 --> 00:38:25,665
Oh. The sun's up.

304
00:38:26,923 --> 00:38:30,423
Go along, now. I'll see you again.

305
00:38:30,594 --> 00:38:33,630
Not if I see you first.

306
00:38:38,477 --> 00:38:42,226
Will, are you really that set on going?

307
00:38:42,815 --> 00:38:45,223
I'd not care to winter here.

308
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:48,438
The way money goes,
I'd be sellin' my saddle.

309
00:38:48,613 --> 00:38:50,938
But ridin' the grub line up here?

310
00:38:51,157 --> 00:38:55,784
There's that Flatiron spread
Bigfoot spoke about.

311
00:38:55,954 --> 00:39:00,367
If that don't work out,
I guess I'll head south. You?

312
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,626
I reckon I'll just hang around a spell.

313
00:39:04,796 --> 00:39:09,542
Maybe get a job bar-doggin'.
See how old Dutchy makes out.

314
00:39:11,262 --> 00:39:14,595
Maybe we'll cut trails some day,
south of here.

315
00:39:14,765 --> 00:39:17,256
Maybe so, Will.

316
00:39:37,831 --> 00:39:41,876
Yeah. That's him, all right.

317
00:39:44,755 --> 00:39:49,216
Ain't no way to forget him.
Not while he's alive, anyway.

318
00:39:49,385 --> 00:39:53,335
- We sure as hell can fix that in a hurry.
- Not yet.

319
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,049
Plenty of time.

320
00:39:56,768 --> 00:39:59,603
He ain't going nowhere we can't find him.

321
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:04,433
And we're just gonna take
our own good time about it.

322
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:12,153
About carvin' him up.

323
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:12,554
You make 'im out, Alex?

324
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:21,312
- Somebody ridin' grub line, I suppose.
- That's a Flatiron horse.

325
00:41:21,482 --> 00:41:26,025
- Ain't that Bright Eyes?
- Yeah, one of old Claude's string.

326
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:45,041
- Want to talk about this?
- I found him like that.

327
00:41:46,675 --> 00:41:51,468
I guess he came off and wrapped up
the whole ball of wax, right there.

328
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:56,016
- Old Claude was a good horsebacker.
- Pretty forky.

329
00:41:56,185 --> 00:41:59,554
If you say so. I never had the pleasure.

330
00:42:02,191 --> 00:42:04,564
What brings you up here?

331
00:42:04,736 --> 00:42:07,856
- Are you the stud duck?
- That's right.

332
00:42:08,823 --> 00:42:12,656
I just shoved a bunch from Texas,
put 'em on the train...

333
00:42:12,828 --> 00:42:16,956
...and went off the payroll.
- You're looking for a meal?

334
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:23,123
No, I'm looking for a job. One of the
Texas hands said you might be hirin'.

335
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:25,497
I'll take 'im.

336
00:42:25,674 --> 00:42:28,878
He ain't comin'. I come instead.

337
00:42:31,097 --> 00:42:36,471
- You must need a hand.
- Claude was a good cow-puncher.

338
00:42:37,228 --> 00:42:42,685
- Mighty good man all the way round.
- Well, sure.

339
00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:46,727
- That's always the way.
- What's always the way?

340
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:51,946
Let a man die,
right away he's good old Claude.

341
00:42:53,662 --> 00:42:56,070
How was he before he bucked out?

342
00:43:01,295 --> 00:43:06,207
You boys, go dig a proper grave.
We'll hold services for him later.

343
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:09,468
Come on over to the bunkhouse.

344
00:43:38,001 --> 00:43:41,500
This here gentleman
calls himself Will Penny.

345
00:43:43,548 --> 00:43:49,587
He comes ridin' around here as nice
as you please, hopin' to find a nice job.

346
00:43:49,763 --> 00:43:54,721
And there lays old Claude,
just beggin' him:

347
00:43:54,893 --> 00:43:59,306
"Take mine, Mr Penny, take mine!"

348
00:44:00,774 --> 00:44:04,475
Hell, that's the story
you give the big augur.

349
00:44:04,654 --> 00:44:10,526
Now, we're just no-account
cow-punchers together, here.

350
00:44:10,702 --> 00:44:13,786
Ain't no need for you to tell us them lies.

351
00:44:18,043 --> 00:44:24,627
Well, son. You dealt this hand.
I guess you'll just have to play it out.

352
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,836
Hold it! All of you.

353
00:44:28,011 --> 00:44:32,555
This man's on the payroll.
A Flatiron hand, not a stranger.

354
00:44:32,725 --> 00:44:35,726
Any eyeballing done
around here, I'll do it.

355
00:44:35,895 --> 00:44:42,147
- Hell, we're just trying to help 'im.
- Yeah, like a sharp stick in the eye.

356
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:45,818
Take Claude's job,
line-rider in the ridge country.

357
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:48,906
Pay's 30 dollars a month.

358
00:44:50,452 --> 00:44:52,907
Are you sure you rode line before?

359
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,614
Sure enough to have
mighty strong feelings about it.

360
00:44:56,792 --> 00:44:59,034
You can tell he's done it before.

361
00:45:03,674 --> 00:45:08,882
We got rules here on the Flatiron.
You hold to 'em and we'll be friends.

362
00:45:09,055 --> 00:45:13,800
Break 'em and you're out before
you can say, "Excuse me, ma'am."

363
00:45:13,976 --> 00:45:17,227
First, we got no drinkin' or gamblin'.

364
00:45:17,397 --> 00:45:22,474
Cut the wolf loose all you want in town,
but not on this layout.

365
00:45:22,652 --> 00:45:25,404
- Is that plain?
- Plain enough.

366
00:45:25,572 --> 00:45:30,199
The pilgrims that come through:
As long as they keep movin', fine.

367
00:45:30,369 --> 00:45:34,497
If they take a beef now and then,
you don't do much either.

368
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:39,660
But you don't let nobody stop.
That's the most important thing.

369
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:43,538
Nobody stops on Flatiron range.

370
00:45:43,716 --> 00:45:47,584
- What if they don't move?
- They'll move all right.

371
00:45:47,762 --> 00:45:51,131
Won't nobody say
nothing about it, neither.

372
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:56,635
One of the boys'll tell you
how to get to the old shack.

373
00:45:56,813 --> 00:46:01,143
Three or four days' ride.
Is there anything else?

374
00:46:03,237 --> 00:46:06,321
No. I reckon you said it all.

375
00:46:11,704 --> 00:46:17,291
About them nesters. If there's
too many to handle, come back for help.

376
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:20,911
Otherwise, I don't wanna
hear from you till spring.

377
00:47:20,526 --> 00:47:23,397
Hello, the shack!

378
00:47:27,242 --> 00:47:29,614
You may as well come on out.

379
00:47:29,786 --> 00:47:34,282
This here's Flatiron range.
You can't squat here.

380
00:47:54,062 --> 00:47:57,016
Don't... don't shoot!

381
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:00,226
Please! Don't shoot.

382
00:48:06,658 --> 00:48:10,526
My name's Will Penny.
You remember me, ma'am, from the...

383
00:48:10,704 --> 00:48:14,453
...road ranch, that man Catron's place?

384
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:19,038
- Don't come nearer! I'm alone and...
- Ma!

385
00:48:19,213 --> 00:48:25,750
The boy's right. Don't ever tell
a stranger out here you're alone.

386
00:48:25,928 --> 00:48:30,555
- Where's your guide, Mr Bodine?
- He went on ahead.

387
00:48:31,976 --> 00:48:35,974
- Did he get paid?
- My husband paid him in St Louis.

388
00:48:36,148 --> 00:48:39,433
He ain't comin' back,
I can promise you that.

389
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:43,394
Anybody could see
he had no stomach for it.

390
00:48:43,572 --> 00:48:45,897
Now look at you.

391
00:48:46,784 --> 00:48:50,616
You and the button,
you can't sleep in the wagon.

392
00:48:50,788 --> 00:48:53,279
Well, of course we won't.

393
00:48:53,457 --> 00:48:56,542
- You can't stay here.
- Why?

394
00:48:56,711 --> 00:49:00,376
This is Flatiron range.
The rules say no squatters.

395
00:49:00,548 --> 00:49:05,127
If you won't move on peaceable,
somebody will come and make you.

396
00:49:05,303 --> 00:49:08,423
Are you gonna do that?

397
00:49:08,598 --> 00:49:11,932
If I don't, they'll just send some...

398
00:49:14,188 --> 00:49:15,979
That's how it is up here.

399
00:49:16,148 --> 00:49:18,769
Nobody's using this old shack, anyway.

400
00:49:18,943 --> 00:49:22,775
A line-rider uses it, son.

401
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:25,700
Look, there ain't no way...

402
00:49:25,866 --> 00:49:28,571
Don't come any nearer. This may go off.

403
00:49:28,745 --> 00:49:30,821
Please, don't be scared.

404
00:49:32,332 --> 00:49:37,373
I ain't gonna hurt you none.
Look, I'll be on my way.

405
00:49:37,963 --> 00:49:41,379
Please be careful
with that damned thing, ma'am.

406
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:44,586
I'll be gone two, three days,
maybe a week.

407
00:49:44,761 --> 00:49:47,383
I gotta see how this place lays out.

408
00:49:49,475 --> 00:49:52,345
That gives you plenty of time to pack up.

409
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:56,564
When I get back, you be gone
from the line-rider's shack.

410
00:49:56,732 --> 00:49:58,440
Mr Penny!

411
00:50:01,195 --> 00:50:02,738
Who is the line-rider?

412
00:50:03,948 --> 00:50:06,486
Me. I am.

413
00:50:10,455 --> 00:50:15,580
- We'll have to get more tomorrow.
- Already?

414
00:50:15,752 --> 00:50:19,620
You want to be warm,
'specially in the morning.

415
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:48,828
You goin' somewheres, boy?

416
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:54,913
He ain't as stout as he looks.

417
00:50:58,339 --> 00:51:00,166
Aw, hell!

418
00:51:29,538 --> 00:51:32,539
Just stand right there...

419
00:51:49,392 --> 00:51:52,014
- Gimme my knife back.
- Get his boots.

420
00:51:52,187 --> 00:51:56,648
Boots hell, Papa.
We're gonna get everything here.

421
00:51:56,817 --> 00:51:59,486
Come on down!

422
00:52:19,758 --> 00:52:21,750
Papa!

423
00:52:22,469 --> 00:52:26,681
He ain't dead yet.
Ain't we gonna get to kill him?

424
00:52:38,778 --> 00:52:42,942
Oh... that's bad.

425
00:52:43,157 --> 00:52:50,370
That is bleedin' real bad.
We don't want that to happen.

426
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:56,165
I knew a fella once,
his wagon team got away with him,

427
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:59,131
run a wheel spoke through his middle.

428
00:52:59,299 --> 00:53:01,837
Bled himself out, right there.

429
00:53:02,011 --> 00:53:05,130
Don't you know how easy it was?

430
00:53:05,931 --> 00:53:11,935
It was like takin' a little sleep
under a shady tree. Didn't hurt at all.

431
00:53:12,104 --> 00:53:17,395
He just got kinda drowsy and...

432
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:20,238
...just dozed off. Well...

433
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:25,281
...sir, it ain't gonna be that easy for you.

434
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:28,619
No, sir. Not that easy.

435
00:53:39,592 --> 00:53:41,501
Remember me?

436
00:53:48,518 --> 00:53:52,931
- Dead?
- No, he ain't dead. Leave him.

437
00:53:53,106 --> 00:53:54,849
Leave him?

438
00:53:55,025 --> 00:53:58,109
Leave him be. Out here by himself...

439
00:53:59,613 --> 00:54:01,938
...no goods...

440
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:08,157
...winter comin' on.
He's gonna be a long while a-dyin'.

441
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:13,076
And all that time,
he's gonna know who done it to him.

442
00:54:13,252 --> 00:54:17,961
Yes, sir. Mighty long time.

443
00:54:18,132 --> 00:54:20,884
And then, he'll be dead.

444
00:54:33,482 --> 00:54:35,688
Ashes to ashes,

445
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:38,066
dust to dust.

446
00:54:38,237 --> 00:54:43,195
The Lord giveth
and the Lord taketh away.

447
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:46,368
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

448
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:52,451
Come on!

449
00:56:41,325 --> 00:56:43,401
- Ma.
- Yes?

450
00:56:45,287 --> 00:56:49,665
- Is he gonna die?
- Well, I hope not.

451
00:56:49,834 --> 00:56:53,534
HG! Go and get some water!

452
00:57:06,685 --> 00:57:08,808
HG!

453
00:57:18,489 --> 00:57:19,900
Yes, Horace?

454
00:57:23,619 --> 00:57:26,241
I thought we didn't like him.

455
00:57:26,414 --> 00:57:28,490
We don't.

456
00:57:30,209 --> 00:57:35,287
I just couldn't let him stay sick.
It wouldn't be...

457
00:57:37,425 --> 00:57:40,095
It wouldn't be Christian, would it?

458
00:57:40,929 --> 00:57:43,965
Like the good Samaritan.

459
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:51,806
That's right.

460
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:32,187
I think you should eat something.
It's been three days.

461
00:58:32,358 --> 00:58:34,315
That long?

462
00:58:39,699 --> 00:58:41,775
Here.

463
00:58:43,954 --> 00:58:45,662
Good...

464
00:58:45,831 --> 00:58:49,247
Thanks, I... I owe you thanks.

465
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:53,875
Let's be clearer. We are not friends.

466
00:58:54,673 --> 00:58:58,541
You can stay until you're better,
but when you are,

467
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:01,008
you will, of course, leave.

468
00:59:09,355 --> 00:59:11,811
Poor old cow's freezing out there.

469
00:59:14,986 --> 00:59:17,477
You awake, mister?

470
00:59:17,656 --> 00:59:19,945
Not really sure.

471
00:59:24,872 --> 00:59:27,789
Was it the Indians? The wild Indians?

472
00:59:29,543 --> 00:59:31,121
How many were there?

473
00:59:33,965 --> 00:59:36,503
Hundred, maybe two hundred.

474
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:41,130
A hundred? You're telling a fib.

475
00:59:42,682 --> 00:59:46,466
That's right, Button. Just a windy.

476
00:59:48,522 --> 00:59:53,350
HG, I think Mr Penny
would like to get some rest now.

477
01:00:08,543 --> 01:00:10,749
Mr Penny!

478
01:00:12,588 --> 01:00:18,294
Before long it'll burn so fast, I won't be
able to chop enough even two-handed!

479
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:20,546
We worked to make you better.

480
01:00:20,764 --> 01:00:24,263
You could hurt yourself
doing something unnecessary.

481
01:00:24,434 --> 01:00:28,183
Unnecessary!
I don't wanna scare nobody,

482
01:00:28,355 --> 01:00:31,855
but it's gonna be hell here
before winter's through.

483
01:00:32,026 --> 01:00:37,530
Working eight days a week,
we won't be able to get ready for it.

484
01:00:37,698 --> 01:00:40,106
Most of this wood's so damn green.

485
01:00:40,284 --> 01:00:44,578
What are we gonna do?
Winter's just hardly started.

486
01:00:46,499 --> 01:00:48,741
Burn chips, I guess.

487
01:00:48,918 --> 01:00:51,456
What's chips?

488
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:58,214
Cow chips, buffalo chips. They make
a hot fire, burn slow. You know.

489
01:01:00,681 --> 01:01:03,172
No, I don't know. What's chips?

490
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:06,554
Well, chips are...

491
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:09,932
Well, they're...

492
01:01:10,107 --> 01:01:12,183
They're just dried up...

493
01:01:14,529 --> 01:01:16,237
Yeah?

494
01:01:20,577 --> 01:01:21,952
Aw, hell.

495
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:26,331
I'll get the button
and go find some. Horace!

496
01:01:30,504 --> 01:01:33,790
Is it true what Ma says,
you'll chase us away?

497
01:01:33,966 --> 01:01:37,798
Look, Button, there's more to it
than just sittin' there.

498
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:40,805
Sit up straight, hang on with your legs.

499
01:01:42,016 --> 01:01:46,844
If they find out about you and your ma
down at the Flatiron...

500
01:01:47,021 --> 01:01:49,939
If you told 'em, would there be shootin'?

501
01:01:50,108 --> 01:01:53,856
- Might be.
- Maybe you oughta tell 'em.

502
01:01:54,029 --> 01:01:57,611
- You want to see some shootin'?
- Never seen any.

503
01:01:57,782 --> 01:02:00,071
I don't think you'd like it much.

504
01:02:00,243 --> 01:02:03,198
How many people have you shot?

505
01:02:03,372 --> 01:02:07,749
Don't think that's anything to brag on
to a nice boy like you.

506
01:02:07,918 --> 01:02:10,789
Come on, sit down and rest a spell.

507
01:02:13,007 --> 01:02:15,545
I ain't so nice. You can tell me.

508
01:02:16,219 --> 01:02:19,670
Well, I guess there was a few times.

509
01:02:19,847 --> 01:02:22,848
- How did it feel?
- Bad.

510
01:02:23,017 --> 01:02:26,850
Bad scared before, bad sorry after.

511
01:02:27,022 --> 01:02:29,180
Ever shoot a red Indian?

512
01:02:29,357 --> 01:02:32,193
Yeah, once.
Didn't like that much neither.

513
01:02:32,361 --> 01:02:35,979
How come Indians
are all red and sunburned?

514
01:02:36,156 --> 01:02:39,193
That ain't sunburn. They come that way.

515
01:02:39,368 --> 01:02:42,702
- Indians don't get sunburn much.
- How come?

516
01:02:42,872 --> 01:02:49,206
They're smart. You've seen them
sunflowers that grow in the spring?

517
01:02:49,378 --> 01:02:51,667
- Yeah.
- Indians take the seeds,

518
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:58,044
grind them up into a butter and spread it
over themselves to keep the sun out.

519
01:02:58,221 --> 01:03:00,759
- Aw, no!
- Straight up truth.

520
01:03:01,725 --> 01:03:06,636
- They make do with what nature gives.
- How do you know all this?

521
01:03:06,813 --> 01:03:10,396
Even a blind hog
roots up an acorn now and then.

522
01:03:10,567 --> 01:03:14,815
Will you keep telling me
all these things you know?

523
01:03:14,989 --> 01:03:17,990
Why, sure, Button.

524
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:21,859
I'll have you a regular scout
in no time at all. Come on.

525
01:03:23,289 --> 01:03:25,412
Come on, boy.

526
01:03:29,212 --> 01:03:35,167
"Here comes the band.
Shall we call Mama and Sandy to see it?

527
01:03:35,343 --> 01:03:41,678
"Let us stand still and
hear the men play as they pass.

528
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:46,228
"I hope they will stop here
and play for us.

529
01:03:46,397 --> 01:03:51,901
"See the large man
in front of the band, with his big hat.

530
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:56,530
"What has he in his hand?"

531
01:04:04,833 --> 01:04:08,451
Cold on the outside
and warm on the inside.

532
01:04:10,172 --> 01:04:12,580
That's the way I hope it works.

533
01:04:12,758 --> 01:04:15,296
I'm almost finished, Ma.

534
01:04:15,469 --> 01:04:19,847
Why not finish tomorrow?
And then tell me what you've read.

535
01:04:20,015 --> 01:04:23,634
How much has gone
from here... to here...

536
01:04:23,811 --> 01:04:27,679
Right now, jump into bed.

537
01:04:27,857 --> 01:04:31,107
- Aw, Ma!
- Hurry up.

538
01:04:36,449 --> 01:04:38,941
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

539
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:42,405
- Night, Will.
- Goodnight, Button.

540
01:04:51,549 --> 01:04:54,384
He reads real good.

541
01:04:57,096 --> 01:05:01,723
That oughta do her.
When the snow comes hard,

542
01:05:01,893 --> 01:05:04,929
she'll seal up even tighter.

543
01:05:05,105 --> 01:05:08,355
You seem well recovered, Mr Penny.

544
01:05:08,525 --> 01:05:11,609
Feelin' real good now.

545
01:05:11,778 --> 01:05:13,901
I'm glad.

546
01:05:15,616 --> 01:05:21,488
- Mr Penny... It's time for a bath.
- Bath!

547
01:05:23,332 --> 01:05:25,574
Yes, Mr Penny.

548
01:05:29,422 --> 01:05:34,131
- A bath.
- What for? I took a bath.

549
01:05:34,302 --> 01:05:38,798
- When?
- Well, back there in Alfred.

550
01:05:38,974 --> 01:05:42,093
At that hotel. It was real hot, too.

551
01:05:44,312 --> 01:05:47,432
That seems like a long time ago.

552
01:05:50,569 --> 01:05:53,487
It's about time for another.

553
01:05:54,573 --> 01:05:56,649
So soon?

554
01:05:56,826 --> 01:06:01,287
- Mr Penny. How often do you bathe?
- What? What?

555
01:06:01,455 --> 01:06:04,540
I said, how often do you bathe?

556
01:06:04,709 --> 01:06:09,003
Eight or nine times, it... depends.

557
01:06:10,674 --> 01:06:12,999
- On what?
- On the weather.

558
01:06:13,176 --> 01:06:16,380
Eight or nine times a month?

559
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:21,632
Eight or nine times a month? A year!

560
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:25,595
- A year?
- Well, sure.

561
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:30,601
You have a real good one
when you finish the shove up north,

562
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:35,357
like at the hotel in Alfred,
then one or two in the winter.

563
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:39,994
Hope you don't catch your death.
And a couple in the spring.

564
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:45,205
And one more good one
before you start the shove up again.

565
01:06:45,377 --> 01:06:50,798
The rest depends on
what kind of water you hit on the drive.

566
01:06:50,966 --> 01:06:56,720
What's wrong with that?
That's as much as anybody.

567
01:06:56,889 --> 01:06:59,462
Not quite anybody, Mr Penny.

568
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:05,640
Now, I think that'll do.

569
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,443
That's hot.

570
01:07:16,326 --> 01:07:22,578
Those clothes could use a wash.
May I have them, please?

571
01:07:22,749 --> 01:07:25,869
What am I gonna wear till they're dry?

572
01:07:26,044 --> 01:07:29,164
I have some of my husband's.

573
01:07:31,425 --> 01:07:34,545
You could give them to me in here.

574
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:03,081
What are you fixin' to do in Oregon?

575
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:06,619
Farm. We're farmers, Mr Penny.

576
01:08:09,006 --> 01:08:12,541
I hear that's mighty good cow country.

577
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:15,803
We're not cowboys, we're farmers.

578
01:08:19,601 --> 01:08:23,052
Good thing, too, I reckon.

579
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:26,350
What's that supposed to mean?

580
01:08:26,525 --> 01:08:32,813
Them horses you got, neither one's
good for much except ridin' to church.

581
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:39,576
Jim is a perfectly good horse,
and so is Daisy.

582
01:08:39,747 --> 01:08:44,208
Neither one has kicked or bucked
since the day we got them.

583
01:08:44,377 --> 01:08:47,046
I surely believe that.

584
01:08:55,931 --> 01:09:02,100
Plain truth is, I'm gonna have hell
if I don't get a decent cow horse.

585
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:05,556
- Well, get one.
- Where?

586
01:09:05,733 --> 01:09:10,810
At Flatiron, Alex'll ask what happened
to the string he gave me.

587
01:09:10,988 --> 01:09:13,740
Well, tell him! It wasn't your fault.

588
01:09:13,908 --> 01:09:16,909
I know that, Mrs Allen.

589
01:09:17,078 --> 01:09:19,651
Well, then?

590
01:09:19,831 --> 01:09:25,252
He's gonna have every hand in the place
out lookin' for them rawhiders.

591
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:27,828
I hope they do, Mr Penny.

592
01:09:28,006 --> 01:09:32,419
You hope they do?
Well, ma'am, you don't know nothin'.

593
01:09:32,594 --> 01:09:37,719
First thing, they'll be here
lookin' for them horses. Then what?

594
01:09:38,976 --> 01:09:40,933
Oh, I see.

595
01:09:46,734 --> 01:09:52,524
Does that mean that you won't tell them
about Horace and me?

596
01:09:54,909 --> 01:09:57,661
No, I ain't gonna tell 'em.

597
01:09:59,331 --> 01:10:01,454
What?

598
01:10:02,918 --> 01:10:06,038
No, I ain't gonna tell 'em!

599
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:57,050
It's plain you'll be staying.

600
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:58,614
Cold weather like this, I miss it some.

601
01:12:06,173 --> 01:12:09,791
You come all the way from Ohio alone?

602
01:12:09,968 --> 01:12:11,925
Yes...

603
01:12:12,095 --> 01:12:16,508
No. With HG and... Mr Bodine.

604
01:12:17,726 --> 01:12:21,178
From St Louis with him.

605
01:12:21,355 --> 01:12:23,478
You're... going on?

606
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:28,934
In the spring.

607
01:12:32,408 --> 01:12:34,697
Alone.

608
01:12:36,037 --> 01:12:39,288
Unless I find someone
to show us the way,

609
01:12:39,458 --> 01:12:42,708
a guide or a...

610
01:12:42,878 --> 01:12:45,036
...wagon train.

611
01:12:45,214 --> 01:12:49,377
Might be your husband'll
come back lookin' for you.

612
01:12:50,928 --> 01:12:53,846
No, he won't do that.

613
01:12:56,434 --> 01:12:59,269
If I was him, that's what I'd do.

614
01:12:59,437 --> 01:13:02,640
Well, you see, you're not.

615
01:13:07,612 --> 01:13:11,527
I hope he doesn't.
He went ahead to start things for us,

616
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:15,745
and if he came back for us,
it would just...

617
01:13:18,123 --> 01:13:21,955
...be a waste.
I mean, it would all be a waste.

618
01:13:22,127 --> 01:13:24,701
It wouldn't be very practical.

619
01:13:26,465 --> 01:13:29,087
I don't know about that.

620
01:13:31,137 --> 01:13:34,091
But this is hard country. Double hard.

621
01:13:36,184 --> 01:13:38,473
I hate it.

622
01:13:41,648 --> 01:13:46,440
You couldn't turn around,
go on back home?

623
01:13:47,905 --> 01:13:50,989
No, I don't think I'd like that either.

624
01:13:54,495 --> 01:14:00,747
Looks like you're caught
between the sap and the bark.

625
01:14:01,878 --> 01:14:06,421
Was it such a bad place, that town?

626
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:16,508
We don't all have the same choices.
We just don't all have the same choices.

627
01:14:20,898 --> 01:14:23,436
We did what we thought was right.

628
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:36,026
- Seems a long way to go for wood.
- Yep, reckon it is.

629
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:40,292
Looks about right.

630
01:14:55,601 --> 01:15:01,521
Here, Button, you cut it.
Right there where I marked it.

631
01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:10,068
Is it really almost Christmas?

632
01:15:11,034 --> 01:15:14,450
- Pretty near.
- It's beautiful.

633
01:15:14,621 --> 01:15:18,204
I chopped it down, all by myself.
Didn't I, Will?

634
01:15:18,375 --> 01:15:20,617
He did it all.

635
01:15:20,794 --> 01:15:23,914
Tonight, I'll make some things
to hang on it.

636
01:15:27,801 --> 01:15:29,841
- Ma?
- Yes.

637
01:15:30,012 --> 01:15:33,132
Next Christmas, will we be home?

638
01:15:34,934 --> 01:15:39,561
Yes, Horace.
Next Christmas, we'll be home.

639
01:15:51,535 --> 01:15:56,695
Sure glad no one's seen me do that.
Be laughed off the place.

640
01:15:56,874 --> 01:15:59,115
What? Milking?

641
01:15:59,293 --> 01:16:03,421
No self-respectin' cow-hand
would be caught milkin' a cow.

642
01:16:03,589 --> 01:16:09,010
- I won't tell anyone.
- I sure won't go braggin' on it none.

643
01:16:11,222 --> 01:16:15,635
O Tannenbaum
O Tannenbaum

644
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:21,350
Wie treu sind deine Bltter

645
01:16:21,524 --> 01:16:27,777
O Tannenbaum
O Tannenbaum

646
01:16:27,948 --> 01:16:33,737
Wie treu sind deine Bltter

647
01:16:33,913 --> 01:16:39,583
Du grnst nicht nur zur Sommerzeit

648
01:16:39,752 --> 01:16:44,710
Nein, auch im Winter, wenn es schneit

649
01:16:44,882 --> 01:16:50,339
O Tannenbaum
O Tannenbaum

650
01:16:50,513 --> 01:16:56,137
Wie treu sind deine Bltter

651
01:16:56,311 --> 01:17:00,475
You remembered!
All the words Grandpa taught you.

652
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:03,769
Very nice. Let's all sing it, in English.

653
01:17:03,944 --> 01:17:09,568
Oh Christmas tree
Oh Christmas tree...

654
01:17:13,454 --> 01:17:18,449
- I don't know them words.
- But everybody knows that one.

655
01:17:18,626 --> 01:17:23,668
- Not me.
- Don't you know any Christmas carols?

656
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,462
I guess not.

657
01:17:26,635 --> 01:17:31,178
We'll teach him one,
that'll be our Christmas present.

658
01:17:34,393 --> 01:17:40,099
Only, that'll be for tomorrow.
It's time to go to bed. Goodnight.

659
01:17:42,651 --> 01:17:44,810
Night, Will.

660
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,084
- Goodnight, Button.
- Goodnight.

661
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:11,671
Is it really almost Christmas?

662
01:18:11,849 --> 01:18:15,183
- Yes, Horace.
- Is it, Will?

663
01:18:15,353 --> 01:18:18,722
- Sure enough, boy.
- Night.

664
01:18:23,361 --> 01:18:28,569
We can never repay you.
You've done so much to help us.

665
01:18:28,742 --> 01:18:31,826
Ain't nobody keepin' books on it.

666
01:18:37,209 --> 01:18:43,129
- Looks like you're due a singing lesson.
- Looks like.

667
01:18:45,009 --> 01:18:49,837
- Is that so funny?
- You won't think so when you hear me.

668
01:18:50,014 --> 01:18:53,964
You'll be fine with HG as a teacher.
He likes you.

669
01:18:54,143 --> 01:18:56,813
Goes both ways.

670
01:18:56,980 --> 01:19:01,891
He's picked himself
a mean chore, though.

671
01:19:02,068 --> 01:19:05,069
Let me do that for you.

672
01:19:06,990 --> 01:19:10,988
- The sooner we start, the better.
- What?

673
01:19:11,161 --> 01:19:14,032
I'll sing a line and you follow.

674
01:19:16,208 --> 01:19:19,957
Deck the halls with boughs of holly...

675
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:25,593
Oh, come on! For HG.

676
01:19:29,013 --> 01:19:32,928
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

677
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:37,562
Very good!
Fa la la la la, la la la la...

678
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,519
Fa la la...

679
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:49,234
- It's plumb silly!
- Let's do the two of them together.

680
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:56,623
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la, la la la la...

681
01:19:56,793 --> 01:20:03,412
'Tis the season to be jolly
Fa la la la la, la la la la...

682
01:20:26,449 --> 01:20:29,818
Maybe you was right at the start of it.

683
01:20:29,994 --> 01:20:33,328
Be better if I'd bed down
somewheres else.

684
01:20:36,501 --> 01:20:40,879
- I think that you misjudge.
- No, I was talking about me.

685
01:20:41,047 --> 01:20:44,666
So am I. I think you misjudge yourself.

686
01:20:44,843 --> 01:20:49,090
No. I ain't no better than the rest of 'em.

687
01:20:50,266 --> 01:20:55,889
You don't know what it's like out here,
one woman for every 20, 30 men,

688
01:20:56,063 --> 01:21:00,310
and she ain't likely to be much
for looks or temper.

689
01:21:00,485 --> 01:21:04,150
Someone like you... you don't know.

690
01:21:09,286 --> 01:21:11,741
Lookin' the way you do,

691
01:21:11,913 --> 01:21:14,583
just...

692
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:19,459
...goin' about your business,
not talkin' all the time like some...

693
01:21:20,673 --> 01:21:25,667
That smile, in your voice,
when you got somethin' to say.

694
01:21:25,845 --> 01:21:29,048
No, please... No.

695
01:21:36,022 --> 01:21:40,980
You do know that, do you?
You know.

696
01:21:44,781 --> 01:21:48,150
I suppose I do.

697
01:21:48,327 --> 01:21:53,036
I tell you I've had... some kind of hell
these last weeks.

698
01:21:54,249 --> 01:21:56,741
Pure hell.

699
01:21:57,753 --> 01:21:59,829
I'm sorry.

700
01:22:00,006 --> 01:22:04,335
No. No need for you to be.

701
01:22:15,647 --> 01:22:20,558
I've been alone
since I was a button like him.

702
01:22:20,736 --> 01:22:23,653
No family to speak of, just...

703
01:22:23,822 --> 01:22:28,899
...helpin' in saloons, livin' with this one,
that one, free and easy...

704
01:22:29,078 --> 01:22:33,290
I never wanted it no other way,
never knew no other way...

705
01:22:33,457 --> 01:22:36,162
...thought that's how it's supposed to be.

706
01:22:38,087 --> 01:22:42,714
Now, here you are... You and him...

707
01:22:46,221 --> 01:22:48,890
You ain't even mine!

708
01:22:52,686 --> 01:22:56,731
You got a way of makin' a man
feel like he's a man.

709
01:23:01,946 --> 01:23:07,153
Reckon it's just a case of too soon old
and too late smart.

710
01:23:26,096 --> 01:23:28,552
Stay, Will!

711
01:23:34,021 --> 01:23:35,930
Merry Christmas!

712
01:24:12,812 --> 01:24:16,015
So. After all that time, you still ain't dead.

713
01:24:16,190 --> 01:24:20,900
That's good. You got yourself
fixed up real nice around here.

714
01:24:21,071 --> 01:24:23,110
Yes, sir. Real nice.

715
01:24:23,281 --> 01:24:24,657
Ma!

716
01:24:26,118 --> 01:24:28,953
Boy! Come on!

717
01:24:32,082 --> 01:24:36,958
- Boy, tell me. Is this your pa?
- No!

718
01:24:37,129 --> 01:24:40,545
- Your husband? Is he your husband?
- No... Yes!

719
01:24:40,716 --> 01:24:44,216
Rejoiceth not in iniquity,
but rejoiceth in the truth.

720
01:24:44,387 --> 01:24:47,222
Ask quick and the lies come out second.

721
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:50,095
- What you gonna do?
- What we gonna do?

722
01:24:50,268 --> 01:24:54,348
We gonna stay here
and we gonna rest from our labours.

723
01:24:54,522 --> 01:25:00,775
But no work, see. No work because
this strong man is gonna do it all for us.

724
01:25:00,946 --> 01:25:03,484
A hired hand, all our own.

725
01:25:03,657 --> 01:25:08,782
Never figured on that, did you?
Our own hired hand.

726
01:25:08,954 --> 01:25:12,158
- Wait, please!
- Now, woman, look!

727
01:25:12,333 --> 01:25:16,794
Which one of my tall sons
are you gonna take up with?

728
01:25:16,963 --> 01:25:21,589
It's a hard choice, I agree.
Both fine, upstanding young men,

729
01:25:21,759 --> 01:25:26,338
- righteous in the eyes of the Lord.
- Amen!

730
01:25:26,514 --> 01:25:31,675
So which one? He ain't your husband
and you took up with him.

731
01:25:31,853 --> 01:25:33,811
She never took up with me.

732
01:25:35,023 --> 01:25:40,065
So, you can take up
with one of my boys. Make a choice.

733
01:25:40,237 --> 01:25:42,313
I can't... I...

734
01:25:44,951 --> 01:25:46,694
Yeah?

735
01:25:48,746 --> 01:25:52,791
- I need time. It's a hard choice.
- Of course it's hard.

736
01:25:52,959 --> 01:25:57,253
I'll give you two days. That's fair.
Now all their fine points:

737
01:25:57,422 --> 01:26:02,049
Rafe is smarter but he's meaner.
Ruf's stronger but he's dumber.

738
01:26:02,427 --> 01:26:06,924
If the Lord had put them together,
they'd be a perfect man!

739
01:26:07,099 --> 01:26:09,471
Take your pick.

740
01:26:09,643 --> 01:26:14,436
Come out before you make trouble!
Get back with the woman and the boy.

741
01:26:14,607 --> 01:26:17,180
- Wait!
- Come on, boy!

742
01:26:19,695 --> 01:26:22,103
Now then, you! Wake him up.

743
01:26:22,281 --> 01:26:25,698
You! We're gonna keep you here,

744
01:26:25,869 --> 01:26:29,238
and we're just gonna keep
workin' your butt off.

745
01:26:29,414 --> 01:26:34,290
And if you misbehave,
I'm gonna let Rafe there skin you.

746
01:26:35,295 --> 01:26:38,914
And I mean skin, sonny.

747
01:26:39,091 --> 01:26:44,465
He skinned a fella once down in Texas.
A mighty fine job, too.

748
01:29:07,705 --> 01:29:09,782
What the hell?

749
01:29:09,958 --> 01:29:12,247
Go back to sleep.

750
01:29:15,714 --> 01:29:17,920
Are you all right?

751
01:29:21,136 --> 01:29:23,212
Yes.

752
01:29:24,598 --> 01:29:28,762
I don't know. Some way,
I gotta get back to Flatiron.

753
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:37,270
- They'll kill you.
- I got a plan.

754
01:29:37,445 --> 01:29:42,440
Ain't gonna be no party,
you'd have to deal with 'em.

755
01:29:46,997 --> 01:29:52,751
Will... You know what they want
from me tomorrow.

756
01:29:53,962 --> 01:29:56,880
I'll do anything. Anything.

757
01:30:04,807 --> 01:30:08,390
Not now! I have to make supper.

758
01:30:08,561 --> 01:30:11,348
- When?
- In the morning, in there.

759
01:30:11,523 --> 01:30:15,770
In the morning, in there?
Just you and me?

760
01:30:15,944 --> 01:30:17,984
Just you and me.

761
01:30:19,531 --> 01:30:24,442
- When?
- Everybody will be busy in the morning.

762
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:28,321
In the morning? Where?

763
01:30:31,544 --> 01:30:36,005
The lean-to. In the morning.

764
01:30:36,174 --> 01:30:40,337
In the morning, in the lean-to.
I'm gonna be there.

765
01:31:16,716 --> 01:31:19,920
I can dance any one o' ya
down to your knees.

766
01:31:20,095 --> 01:31:22,633
If you don't believe me, gimme a try.

767
01:31:51,086 --> 01:31:53,493
Hey, boy, get your mouth off her!

768
01:33:44,997 --> 01:33:47,619
Did you forget what you told me?

769
01:33:47,792 --> 01:33:50,330
- What...?
- What's the matter?

770
01:33:50,503 --> 01:33:54,667
- Who asked you to come in here?
- You wanna know?

771
01:33:54,841 --> 01:33:57,332
She did. That's who.

772
01:33:57,510 --> 01:34:02,671
You're lyin'. She didn't say that to you,
she told me to come here.

773
01:34:02,849 --> 01:34:09,054
I asked both of you. I wanted to see
who would be the better man.

774
01:34:10,691 --> 01:34:12,933
And she made her decision, see?

775
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:16,775
You've been telling me a lie, girl.

776
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:15,378
There's a woman and a boy in the cabin.

777
01:35:15,551 --> 01:35:18,754
Trouble runs to you
like a calf to its mama.

778
01:35:18,929 --> 01:35:20,637
Blue! What the...

779
01:35:24,268 --> 01:35:27,020
You sure forget your friends in a hurry.

780
01:35:27,188 --> 01:35:32,775
Thought you were from the Flatiron.
So glad to see you, I never looked.

781
01:35:39,368 --> 01:35:42,867
Lord was smilin' down
when he put you here.

782
01:35:43,038 --> 01:35:46,158
- Lord nothin', we come lookin' for you.
- We?

783
01:35:56,719 --> 01:35:59,554
- Dutchy!
- Ja. It's me, all right.

784
01:35:59,722 --> 01:36:03,767
- Doctor in Alfred said we saved his life.
- How?

785
01:36:03,935 --> 01:36:08,597
Leavin' him in the wagon.
It was so cold, his blood wouldn't run.

786
01:36:08,773 --> 01:36:12,024
If we'd kept him warm,
he'd have bled right out.

787
01:36:12,194 --> 01:36:14,685
What the hell happened over there?

788
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:18,447
I need some help. Bad.

789
01:36:37,095 --> 01:36:41,722
How'd you like to get us down
in this wagon? Close to the shack.

790
01:36:41,892 --> 01:36:44,015
Real close.

791
01:36:47,898 --> 01:36:49,938
Load the gun!

792
01:38:09,108 --> 01:38:10,484
HG!

793
01:38:14,572 --> 01:38:18,072
Get away from there! Get away!

794
01:38:35,887 --> 01:38:37,595
Will!

795
01:39:11,674 --> 01:39:16,171
- Gonna tell me about this, Penny?
- How come you fellas are here?

796
01:39:16,971 --> 01:39:19,676
Your compadres come lookin' for you.

797
01:39:19,849 --> 01:39:23,515
I figured you might be
planning something.

798
01:39:23,687 --> 01:39:30,650
Then one of the Lazy Bar Seven hands
said we had cattle scattered all over.

799
01:39:30,819 --> 01:39:34,438
We wondered if anybody
was takin' care of this camp.

800
01:39:34,615 --> 01:39:40,286
- I can see now why we didn't.
- You got it wrong, Alex.

801
01:39:40,454 --> 01:39:42,862
It'll be all right. Don't worry.

802
01:39:44,667 --> 01:39:47,538
Them rawhiders damn near killed me.

803
01:39:47,712 --> 01:39:51,461
Would have done,
if it hadn't been for that lady.

804
01:39:51,633 --> 01:39:53,507
And them?

805
01:39:53,677 --> 01:39:59,798
We come to take him back to that man
Catron, he owes us 50 dollars each.

806
01:39:59,975 --> 01:40:02,264
And them two?

807
01:40:02,436 --> 01:40:07,098
Hell, I couldn't turn 'em out
to winter up here alone.

808
01:40:07,274 --> 01:40:09,979
That must have been some comfort.

809
01:40:10,152 --> 01:40:15,111
There's no call for that.
What would you have done in my place?

810
01:40:15,283 --> 01:40:17,774
Took 'em back down to headquarters.

811
01:40:17,994 --> 01:40:23,534
We'd have found work for 'em till spring,
or till the wagon train comes.

812
01:40:23,708 --> 01:40:25,950
Maybe you thought of that, too.

813
01:40:27,045 --> 01:40:28,789
Reckon I did.

814
01:40:30,382 --> 01:40:33,383
We'll do that right now, then.

815
01:40:54,449 --> 01:40:56,109
What happened?

816
01:40:56,326 --> 01:41:01,403
Alex has got his back arched up.
Can't blame him.

817
01:41:04,418 --> 01:41:06,494
He's sending you down below.

818
01:41:08,547 --> 01:41:11,632
You coming with us?

819
01:41:12,385 --> 01:41:17,011
You want us to go down and wait,
while you work the winter up here?

820
01:41:20,351 --> 01:41:23,269
I ain't stayin' here.

821
01:41:27,359 --> 01:41:30,276
Will we go with you?

822
01:41:31,071 --> 01:41:33,028
Cath...

823
01:41:35,784 --> 01:41:38,904
Shoot, you're still married!

824
01:41:42,082 --> 01:41:46,211
- Pardon?
- You got a husband.

825
01:41:49,799 --> 01:41:52,919
I've never been married, really.

826
01:41:53,094 --> 01:41:58,848
He'd never notice if we never showed up.
Except for the work.

827
01:41:59,017 --> 01:42:04,224
You've been more of a father to Horace
than Reuben ever was.

828
01:42:11,822 --> 01:42:14,823
That's not it, though, is it, Will?

829
01:42:17,870 --> 01:42:20,361
Will. What is it?

830
01:42:21,833 --> 01:42:24,869
It's come on so...

831
01:42:25,044 --> 01:42:27,251
...so quick, like.

832
01:42:30,675 --> 01:42:32,585
Will...

833
01:42:33,678 --> 01:42:38,341
Before I married Reuben,
I had two years to think about it.

834
01:42:38,517 --> 01:42:45,054
All that time never helped a bit. Now,
I've got a few minutes and I'm sure.

835
01:42:47,026 --> 01:42:49,315
I'm absolutely sure.

836
01:42:51,113 --> 01:42:54,233
I'm damn near 50 years old!

837
01:42:57,453 --> 01:42:59,113
Yes.

838
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:04,575
What could we do?

839
01:43:06,338 --> 01:43:11,249
There are lots of homesteads,
all over this land.

840
01:43:11,426 --> 01:43:14,297
Will... Before...

841
01:43:14,471 --> 01:43:18,516
...when we talked,
what did you think we'd do?

842
01:43:22,021 --> 01:43:24,773
I don't know. I...

843
01:43:24,941 --> 01:43:29,354
I never really come
face to face with it, I guess.

844
01:43:32,115 --> 01:43:36,243
Will. Do you love me?

845
01:43:36,411 --> 01:43:39,282
What do I know about love?

846
01:43:39,456 --> 01:43:45,162
Love? I guess you could call it that...
And more.

847
01:43:45,337 --> 01:43:49,038
I never felt like this about nobody.

848
01:43:49,216 --> 01:43:55,006
I want you, and the button,
for my own, but...

849
01:43:57,558 --> 01:43:59,551
But?

850
01:43:59,727 --> 01:44:04,603
It takes a heap of time, years,
to build up a spread.

851
01:44:04,774 --> 01:44:07,526
I don't have them years no more.

852
01:44:07,694 --> 01:44:12,689
Homestead! We'd just be startin' up
with a few measly cows.

853
01:44:12,866 --> 01:44:17,493
Come January, I'd be trying to feed you,
the button, the cattle...

854
01:44:17,663 --> 01:44:22,954
- We don't have to ranch! We can farm.
- I don't know nothin' about farmin'.

855
01:44:23,127 --> 01:44:24,751
I do.

856
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:30,425
Cath, I'm a cow-hand.
Been a cow-hand all my life.

857
01:44:30,593 --> 01:44:34,887
- Scared?
- Damn right. Bad scared.

858
01:44:35,056 --> 01:44:41,676
I told you before,
I lived one way my whole life.

859
01:44:41,855 --> 01:44:45,473
What would I do?

860
01:44:45,651 --> 01:44:52,484
Try to feed you and the boy, on some
measly six-cow ranch? What would I do?

861
01:44:55,286 --> 01:44:57,362
Love us?

862
01:44:58,789 --> 01:45:00,996
Hell...

863
01:45:01,167 --> 01:45:04,618
You don't know
how bad it can be, ranchin'.

864
01:45:05,755 --> 01:45:11,710
Say I got a frostbit foot,
or broke my hand?

865
01:45:11,886 --> 01:45:16,632
Then we're starvin'.
How's love gonna stand up to that?

866
01:45:19,561 --> 01:45:21,768
It's supposed to, isn't it?

867
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:28,436
Yeah.

868
01:45:28,612 --> 01:45:32,028
Come closer with you than I ever will,

869
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:35,284
with anybody.

870
01:45:35,453 --> 01:45:39,451
I seen what it was meant to be like.

871
01:45:40,583 --> 01:45:44,118
But... it's too late, Cath.

872
01:45:46,006 --> 01:45:48,212
Too late for me.

873
01:45:54,264 --> 01:45:57,301
I ain't a good gamble for you.

874
01:46:04,734 --> 01:46:09,941
I wish luck to you, though.
I surely do that.

875
01:46:16,121 --> 01:46:18,576
I love that boy.

876
01:46:42,023 --> 01:46:46,519
- Pick us up them 50 dollars?
- You bet.

877
01:46:46,695 --> 01:46:48,853
I'm quittin', Alex.

878
01:46:49,030 --> 01:46:51,403
I couldn't work here no more.

879
01:46:51,575 --> 01:46:58,372
Any money I got comin' for my time,
give it to Mrs Allen and the boy.

880
01:47:14,224 --> 01:47:17,011
Is he ever comin' back, Ma?

881
01:47:17,185 --> 01:47:19,225
Is he?

882
01:47:28,363 --> 01:47:31,483
Say goodbye, Horace.

883
01:47:32,576 --> 01:47:34,616
Wave goodbye.

884
01:47:48,092 --> 01:47:49,468
Bye, Will.

885
01:47:52,722 --> 01:47:54,845
Bye, Will!

886
01:47:56,518 --> 01:47:57,893
Bye.
