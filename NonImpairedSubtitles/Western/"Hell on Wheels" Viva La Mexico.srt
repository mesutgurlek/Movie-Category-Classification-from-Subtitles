2
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:58,510
Brake! Brake!

3
00:01:13,623 --> 00:01:15,577
What's going on?

4
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,302
Keep your yankee hands
where we can see 'em

5
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:41,386
And no one will get shot!

6
00:01:42,705 --> 00:01:43,972
We want your valuables.

7
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,840
Give me your money, let's go.

8
00:01:45,892 --> 00:01:49,094
Let's go. Empty those pockets.
Let's go.

9
00:01:49,178 --> 00:01:51,062
Come on there.
Don't you hold out on me, now.

10
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,843
Take this.

11
00:01:56,963 --> 00:01:58,737
Damn it, give me that gun!

12
00:01:58,821 --> 00:01:59,887
Damn--
give me that!

13
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,823
What have you got?
Get back there!

14
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,991
Blow the lock!

15
00:02:03,058 --> 00:02:03,992
All right.

16
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:05,727
Don't shoot me.

17
00:02:07,896 --> 00:02:08,896
Whoo!

18
00:02:08,948 --> 00:02:11,833
What you think about that, huh?

19
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,418
Bring that sack in here!

20
00:02:13,502 --> 00:02:15,337
Let's get moving.

21
00:02:15,404 --> 00:02:16,621
Come on!

22
00:02:16,706 --> 00:02:19,007
You'll be all right!
Let's go!

23
00:02:19,074 --> 00:02:20,241
Can you ride?

24
00:02:20,293 --> 00:02:21,843
Yeah.

25
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,461
You on?
Yeah.

26
00:02:23,546 --> 00:02:26,715
All right, go, go, let's go.

27
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:29,517
Come on, Mississippi!

28
00:02:29,585 --> 00:02:31,219
Come on!

29
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,271
Come on, boys!

30
00:03:25,194 --> 00:03:28,863
One more man
on the front line. Let's go!

31
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,433
Where's my money?!
Not again.

32
00:04:24,553 --> 00:04:25,557
Hey, you.

33
00:04:25,677 --> 00:04:26,499
Hey!

34
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:29,816
Why don't you kill the bastard?

35
00:04:32,544 --> 00:04:34,045
All right, get back to work!

36
00:04:34,096 --> 00:04:35,480
Go to hell, Schmidt!

37
00:04:35,547 --> 00:04:38,182
Get back to work, you bastards!

38
00:04:43,989 --> 00:04:45,740
Ain't you gonna do something?

39
00:04:45,824 --> 00:04:49,027
Not my job.

40
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:55,950
What exactly is your job?

41
00:04:56,035 --> 00:04:58,953
You'll see.

42
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:09,053
Graders are averaging less
than 2,000 feet per day.

43
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:12,383
And last week only
1,200 rails were spiked.

44
00:05:12,434 --> 00:05:14,919
1,800 ties laid.

45
00:05:16,355 --> 00:05:18,556
It's simply
not acceptable.

46
00:05:18,607 --> 00:05:20,692
Have you talked to
Mr. Schmidt about all this?

47
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,562
Yes. He tipped his hat
at me and looked coy.

48
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:28,199
I considered wiping the grin off
his face with the back of my hand.

49
00:05:33,622 --> 00:05:35,790
But I thought better of it.

50
00:05:35,874 --> 00:05:37,375
Good.

51
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:41,713
Lily, you must remember
we males

52
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,333
have very fragile egos.

53
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:48,786
Especially when it comes to
dealing with a strong woman.

54
00:05:48,837 --> 00:05:51,556
Hmm.
You poor things.

55
00:05:51,623 --> 00:05:53,558
Mm.

56
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,226
Well, today is payday.

57
00:05:55,293 --> 00:05:56,460
Tomorrow will be better.

58
00:05:56,512 --> 00:05:59,263
Wouldn't hold my
breath, Mr. Durant.

59
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:01,816
Payroll train's
been robbed again.

60
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,318
Damn it!

61
00:06:03,402 --> 00:06:06,821
Thom, now is the time.
Send word to Fort Kearny.

62
00:06:06,905 --> 00:06:08,690
We need protection.

63
00:06:08,774 --> 00:06:11,359
We can't. If our enemies
in Washington knew

64
00:06:11,443 --> 00:06:13,978
we can't protect
our own payroll...

65
00:06:16,865 --> 00:06:18,282
Mr. Ferguson.

66
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:21,652
It seems we'll be needing
your services again.

67
00:06:21,704 --> 00:06:24,321
Happy to oblige, sir.

68
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,165
What in the hell is that?

69
00:06:34,216 --> 00:06:35,266
This here?

70
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,385
200s worth
of Yankee bank notes.

71
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:39,604
That's your cut, Bohannon.

72
00:06:39,671 --> 00:06:42,690
I thought the idea was...

73
00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:45,560
We save our take
for the colony for Mexico.

74
00:06:45,644 --> 00:06:47,445
General Shelby and Magruder's
already down there.

75
00:06:47,512 --> 00:06:50,114
We're going to Mexico,
I assure you.

76
00:06:50,182 --> 00:06:52,516
I told you, these boys,
they don't get it.

77
00:06:52,568 --> 00:06:55,620
We're gonna need
this money for...

78
00:06:55,687 --> 00:06:57,321
Buying land, putting in crops,

79
00:06:57,373 --> 00:06:59,040
cattle, I don't know.

80
00:06:59,124 --> 00:07:00,691
Look, if we're gonna do this,

81
00:07:00,743 --> 00:07:02,160
we're gonna do it right.

82
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:05,213
I call the shots here, not you.

83
00:07:05,297 --> 00:07:09,217
I'm just asking for...

84
00:07:09,301 --> 00:07:11,135
A little contribution.

85
00:07:11,203 --> 00:07:14,639
Then you can keep calling the shots.
How about that?

86
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:29,020
You worry too much, Bohannon.

87
00:07:29,071 --> 00:07:30,855
Heh heh heh heh.

88
00:07:30,906 --> 00:07:33,357
More coffee?
We won last night.

89
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:36,494
We deserve a chance to whoop
it up a little, right, boys?

90
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:37,829
That's right!

91
00:07:37,896 --> 00:07:39,697
Viva LA Mexico.
Viva LA Mexico.

92
00:07:39,748 --> 00:07:42,233
Viva LA Mexico.

93
00:07:42,284 --> 00:07:43,701
Here you go, doc.

94
00:07:43,752 --> 00:07:45,736
Put that in the kitty.

95
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:47,004
Another contribution, Cullen?

96
00:07:47,072 --> 00:07:49,173
Yeah.

97
00:07:49,241 --> 00:07:51,676
How's Tommy doing?

98
00:07:51,743 --> 00:07:54,128
He's dead.

99
00:07:59,318 --> 00:08:01,719
Yeah.

100
00:08:01,787 --> 00:08:04,689
Let's take a look
at that shoulder.

101
00:08:04,756 --> 00:08:06,474
Come on.

102
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,428
I seem to remember

103
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,867
pulling buckshot out of
your rear end once before.

104
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:18,903
I must have patched you up

105
00:08:18,954 --> 00:08:22,457
more than any other kid
in meridian.

106
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,165
Seems like a lifetime ago,
doesn't it?

107
00:08:33,785 --> 00:08:36,637
Well, it was.

108
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:40,892
Hey, you know, Cullen,

109
00:08:40,976 --> 00:08:45,062
I had mixed feelings
about you joining up with us

110
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,298
when we ran into you
down in meridian.

111
00:08:47,349 --> 00:08:49,433
Doc...

112
00:08:49,485 --> 00:08:52,803
You don't need to worry
about me, all right?

113
00:08:52,855 --> 00:08:57,742
I knew what I was getting into.

114
00:08:57,809 --> 00:08:59,310
Hey.

115
00:09:03,165 --> 00:09:05,500
To a new start

116
00:09:05,584 --> 00:09:08,703
down in old Mexico.

117
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,494
Amen to that.

118
00:09:17,546 --> 00:09:22,433
And all them pretty senoritas.

119
00:09:31,176 --> 00:09:33,361
I'd like to talk to you
about the love of Christ.

120
00:09:33,445 --> 00:09:35,313
Brothers and sisters...

121
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,866
Be firm.

122
00:09:41,036 --> 00:09:42,954
Be watchful.

123
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:45,189
Stand firm in your faith.

124
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,692
Act like men.

125
00:09:48,744 --> 00:09:50,545
Be strong.

126
00:09:52,364 --> 00:09:53,965
As Jesus turned,

127
00:09:54,032 --> 00:09:58,052
and seeing her, he said,

128
00:09:58,136 --> 00:10:00,338
"Take heart, daughter,

129
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:02,557
our faith
has made you well."

130
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:06,377
And the woman was made well.

131
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:09,981
Buy some property in the
fastest-growing town in the territory.

132
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:11,816
Right, chief.

133
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:13,401
Start a business.

134
00:10:13,485 --> 00:10:15,519
Build a homestead.

135
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:17,572
The finest tent...

136
00:10:17,656 --> 00:10:18,990
Right here, sir.

137
00:10:19,057 --> 00:10:21,075
Consider yourself
the proud owner

138
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,327
of a prime piece
of railroad real estate.

139
00:10:27,732 --> 00:10:29,750
Step right up!

140
00:10:29,835 --> 00:10:32,870
Fine property,
waiting to be had.

141
00:10:32,921 --> 00:10:34,088
Lots for sale!
Lots for sale!

142
00:10:34,172 --> 00:10:37,875
What?
Mick.

143
00:10:37,926 --> 00:10:40,744
Shouldn't you be getting on with
that other business of yours?

144
00:10:40,796 --> 00:10:42,430
What other business?

145
00:10:44,082 --> 00:10:45,683
I don't much care, brother,

146
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,635
as long as you get on with it.

147
00:10:53,108 --> 00:10:56,110
Right.

148
00:10:56,194 --> 00:10:58,479
Miss Ruth.

149
00:10:59,781 --> 00:11:01,782
What can I do for you today?

150
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:05,286
It's about the rent,
I'm afraid.

151
00:11:08,273 --> 00:11:09,490
Late again?

152
00:11:09,574 --> 00:11:11,075
It's father.
He's not well.

153
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:13,411
And if he's not well,
he can't preach.

154
00:11:13,462 --> 00:11:15,830
And if he can't preach, there's
no collection money coming in.

155
00:11:15,914 --> 00:11:18,132
I'm sympathetic
to your plight, miss Ruth,

156
00:11:18,216 --> 00:11:21,135
but, uh, there's only
so much I can do.

157
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:24,088
I'm but a humble employee
of the railroad.

158
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:27,291
I'm afraid I don't know
what to do.

159
00:11:29,294 --> 00:11:32,963
Maybe we could
discuss this at dinner.

160
00:11:33,015 --> 00:11:35,399
With my father there,
of course.

161
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:39,303
I was thinking maybe
just the two of us.

162
00:11:39,354 --> 00:11:43,307
Mr. McGinnes, what sort of
girl do you think I am?

163
00:11:46,328 --> 00:11:49,914
I'll do my best
to have you the rent soon.

164
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:54,618
You have my word.

165
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,705
Yes.

166
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:18,526
Mr. Gundersen.

167
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:24,315
Ah. Mit Herredomme...

168
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:26,117
What happened to him?

169
00:12:26,184 --> 00:12:30,154
Ah, stabbed in the eye
it would appear.

170
00:12:30,205 --> 00:12:33,824
Another victim of the
chaos that presides here.

171
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,460
Bandits rob your trains,

172
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:37,962
murderers run your streets,

173
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:42,049
work has slowed to a--
to a crawl.

174
00:12:42,134 --> 00:12:45,636
You needn't remind me
of my own business, Gundersen.

175
00:12:45,703 --> 00:12:49,640
Sir, I have worked for you

176
00:12:49,707 --> 00:12:51,058
since before New York.

177
00:12:51,143 --> 00:12:55,513
I've always been faithful
and diligent, hmm?

178
00:12:55,564 --> 00:12:58,065
Let me help you.

179
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,552
I appreciate it.

180
00:13:01,603 --> 00:13:05,222
But since those Irish boys
tarred and feathered you

181
00:13:05,273 --> 00:13:08,859
and ran you out of town
on a rail...

182
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,747
Embrace this new job,
Gundersen.

183
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,399
Lowly and noisome
though it may be,

184
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:22,072
you provide an invaluable
service to the community.

185
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,183
Community.

186
00:13:33,635 --> 00:13:35,770
Community.

187
00:13:35,854 --> 00:13:37,688
♪ Hurrah, hurrah

188
00:13:37,755 --> 00:13:39,557
♪ for southern rights, hurrah

189
00:13:39,624 --> 00:13:41,525
♪ hurrah for
the Bonnie blue flag ♪

190
00:13:41,593 --> 00:13:42,893
♪ that bears a single star

191
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,567
Think they would have
learned their damn lesson.

192
00:13:49,618 --> 00:13:51,202
Especially after
general Sherman

193
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:53,704
had that little
barbecue of his.

194
00:13:59,995 --> 00:14:02,963
Just ignore 'em, Cullen.

195
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:08,169
I can't.

196
00:14:16,761 --> 00:14:19,463
How you boys don'?

197
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:24,635
Ohh!

198
00:14:24,686 --> 00:14:26,803
Aah!

199
00:14:34,696 --> 00:14:36,697
Come here, boy.

200
00:14:49,377 --> 00:14:51,846
You gonna feel that tomorrow.

201
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:57,218
Them Yankee farm boys are gonna
feel it a whole lot worse.

202
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:02,857
Ahh.

203
00:15:02,941 --> 00:15:06,843
Your father had
a penchant for spirits

204
00:15:06,895 --> 00:15:08,479
and a good fight.

205
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,866
Like father like son, huh?

206
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,201
I said a good fight.

207
00:15:14,286 --> 00:15:16,853
Tell me, Cullen,

208
00:15:16,905 --> 00:15:18,956
what did you gain in there?

209
00:15:19,023 --> 00:15:21,692
You teach those Yankee
boys a lesson, did you?

210
00:15:21,743 --> 00:15:23,577
Something like that, yeah.

211
00:15:23,662 --> 00:15:26,547
It's you who needs the lesson.

212
00:15:26,631 --> 00:15:28,916
You are better than
them damn fools in there.

213
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,302
If they's fools, what you
don' ridin' with 'em?

214
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:33,870
Well, sad as it is, right now,

215
00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:37,641
those boys are the closest
thing to family I got.

216
00:15:40,262 --> 00:15:43,063
They dug up my family, doc.

217
00:15:54,225 --> 00:15:56,911
Carpetbaggers,

218
00:15:56,995 --> 00:15:58,529
they tore up plenty of graves

219
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,531
in our hometowns
looking for loot.

220
00:16:00,582 --> 00:16:04,201
They dug up my boy.

221
00:16:04,252 --> 00:16:06,837
My Mary.

222
00:16:11,676 --> 00:16:14,345
What kind of man does that?

223
00:17:20,475 --> 00:17:22,229
Elam?

224
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,765
In the flesh.

225
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:28,350
Why are you here?

226
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:30,653
Just passing through.

227
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:35,574
You still working
for Mr. Durant?

228
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:38,777
I'm on the job right now.

229
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,616
I guess you got
what you wanted, then.

230
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,626
Hello, Mr. Ferguson.

231
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:58,764
It's a surprise to see you
again, sir.

232
00:17:58,849 --> 00:18:01,934
What brings you
to our fair town?

233
00:18:02,018 --> 00:18:06,021
He's on railroad business
for Mr. Durant.

234
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:09,424
Ah. I, too,
work for Mr. Durant.

235
00:18:09,476 --> 00:18:13,195
He appointed me
station agent here.

236
00:18:13,263 --> 00:18:15,865
Congratulations.

237
00:18:15,932 --> 00:18:18,367
To both of you.

238
00:18:19,452 --> 00:18:22,204
Would you like to join us
for supper?

239
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:28,043
Well, maybe
some other time, then.

240
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:33,716
Yeah.

241
00:18:33,783 --> 00:18:35,968
Maybe some other time.

242
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:56,655
Wake up!

243
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,574
Get up!

244
00:18:58,641 --> 00:19:00,309
Supply train
leavin' in 5 minutes!

245
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,611
Ain't all of you
ain't got a job.

246
00:19:02,662 --> 00:19:05,981
Get up, you bastards!

247
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,705
Penny is dead!

248
00:19:15,709 --> 00:19:18,493
Ginny?
What is it?

249
00:19:28,838 --> 00:19:32,174
Get back to work.
There's men waitin'.

250
00:19:56,216 --> 00:19:59,418
Ohh...

251
00:20:43,013 --> 00:20:45,580
Such a terrible thing.

252
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:47,933
Truly it is, brother.

253
00:20:48,018 --> 00:20:50,352
Tragic.

254
00:20:51,805 --> 00:20:53,689
But this could be
the opportunity

255
00:20:53,756 --> 00:20:55,757
we've been looking for.

256
00:21:04,951 --> 00:21:08,904
You ain't gonna
believe this, boys.

257
00:21:08,955 --> 00:21:12,274
There's a nigger guard
in the payroll car.

258
00:21:12,325 --> 00:21:15,377
Let me take point, captain.
Shoot that buck dead.

259
00:21:15,445 --> 00:21:18,947
Let me see him.

260
00:21:23,286 --> 00:21:28,640
I've been the first man
through the door all along.

261
00:21:28,725 --> 00:21:32,127
I think I've earned the right
to take him down.

262
00:21:32,178 --> 00:21:35,180
All right, Bohannon,
you got it.

263
00:21:49,612 --> 00:21:52,865
No, don't.

264
00:21:59,122 --> 00:22:02,174
I don't know why they bother
me with these things.

265
00:22:02,258 --> 00:22:03,825
Thomas, what is it?

266
00:22:03,877 --> 00:22:07,679
It seems a woman
has been murdered.

267
00:22:07,764 --> 00:22:11,016
A first for
our little community.

268
00:22:11,101 --> 00:22:13,435
She was just a whore,
but still...

269
00:22:13,503 --> 00:22:16,021
Do they know who killed her?

270
00:22:16,106 --> 00:22:19,892
Certainly one of our employees.

271
00:22:22,312 --> 00:22:27,783
Lily, you don't have to
concern yourself with this.

272
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:30,119
Thomas, this man
needs to be found.

273
00:22:30,186 --> 00:22:32,321
He will be punished.

274
00:22:32,372 --> 00:22:34,289
I'm afraid nobody's
going to care very much

275
00:22:34,357 --> 00:22:36,024
about the killing
of a prostitute.

276
00:22:36,075 --> 00:22:38,660
Thomas, you hang
horse thieves here.

277
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:41,663
Are you saying horses are more
valuable than these women?

278
00:22:41,714 --> 00:22:45,250
Sad to say, but yes.
Yes, they are.

279
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,870
You don't mean that.

280
00:22:48,922 --> 00:22:51,056
Lily, she chose
a dangerous profession.

281
00:22:51,141 --> 00:22:55,227
With choices come consequences.

282
00:22:55,311 --> 00:23:00,065
Let's eat our
breakfast, shall we?

283
00:23:05,738 --> 00:23:07,439
Now!

284
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,944
Hyah!

285
00:23:19,752 --> 00:23:22,337
Hyah!

286
00:23:22,405 --> 00:23:25,174
Hyah!

287
00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:32,714
All right,
this here's a stickup!

288
00:23:32,765 --> 00:23:34,716
All right, everybody,
wallet, watch, jewelry,

289
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:37,853
put it in the bag right now.

290
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,438
Come on, now.
Don't be foolish.

291
00:23:39,522 --> 00:23:41,356
Open up!

292
00:23:41,424 --> 00:23:42,924
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

293
00:23:42,976 --> 00:23:44,610
Open the damn door!

294
00:23:44,694 --> 00:23:45,927
Bohannon?

295
00:23:45,979 --> 00:23:47,863
Damn right. Open up.

296
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,951
Son, you want to sit down?

297
00:23:54,904 --> 00:23:57,122
What the hell you don' here?

298
00:23:57,207 --> 00:24:00,108
Trying to keep you
from getting yourself killed.

299
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,710
Get that gun out of my face
and give me the payroll.

300
00:24:01,777 --> 00:24:03,278
You hand that money over
I can't.

301
00:24:03,329 --> 00:24:04,580
Or I'll kill you my damn self.

302
00:24:04,631 --> 00:24:06,381
Go on, then.

303
00:24:06,449 --> 00:24:08,417
Pull the trigger.

304
00:24:08,468 --> 00:24:11,286
What the hell's going on in there?

305
00:24:12,955 --> 00:24:15,724
You stupid son of a...

306
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,978
Aim high.

307
00:24:20,063 --> 00:24:22,814
Keep shooting.

308
00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:24,733
Right now!
Put it in the bag.

309
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,818
He's got the drop on me!

310
00:24:26,903 --> 00:24:28,153
Come on! We gotta
get off this train!

311
00:24:28,238 --> 00:24:30,355
Come on.

312
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,661
Uhh!

313
00:24:35,745 --> 00:24:39,197
Let's get outta here!

314
00:24:41,317 --> 00:24:42,984
Come on, boys.
Let's ride!

315
00:24:43,036 --> 00:24:45,153
Hyah! Hyah!

316
00:24:57,748 --> 00:24:59,866
Come in.

317
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:02,035
Eh...Tor Gundersen, ma'am.

318
00:25:02,086 --> 00:25:04,971
Here to empty your Jerry pot.

319
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,424
Thank you, Mr. Gundersen.

320
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:09,926
Not necessary, ma'am.

321
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:12,596
It's my job.
We all must do our jobs, huh?

322
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:18,151
Yes, but...
I imagine it's hard with...

323
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:19,486
Considering--

324
00:25:19,553 --> 00:25:20,887
how far I've fallen.

325
00:25:20,938 --> 00:25:23,690
Look h...how far
you rose up.

326
00:25:23,741 --> 00:25:26,359
Hmm? Mm.

327
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,744
Aye.

328
00:25:27,828 --> 00:25:30,864
We all do what we must
to carry on.

329
00:25:30,915 --> 00:25:32,415
Hmm.

330
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:38,404
Mr. Gundersen.
The woman, um...

331
00:25:38,456 --> 00:25:40,006
The one they killed...

332
00:25:40,074 --> 00:25:42,175
The whore?

333
00:25:42,243 --> 00:25:44,127
What--what will happen
to her?

334
00:25:44,212 --> 00:25:48,181
She'll have a whore's grave.

335
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:03,813
See that she gets
a proper burial.

336
00:26:05,366 --> 00:26:07,450
Ah...

337
00:26:09,103 --> 00:26:14,791
The reverend and I will--
will bury her 6 feet down, eh?

338
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:16,910
Like a proper lady.

339
00:26:16,961 --> 00:26:19,546
Thank you.

340
00:26:19,613 --> 00:26:20,997
Mm.

341
00:26:22,116 --> 00:26:23,500
Have a good day.

342
00:26:32,459 --> 00:26:34,627
Good morning, father.

343
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,431
I'm preparing--

344
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:40,984
For Sunday's sermon.

345
00:26:41,068 --> 00:26:43,570
Matthew 7:13.

346
00:26:45,072 --> 00:26:48,308
You sure you're up to it?

347
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:52,028
I am, Ruth.

348
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,253
Then I suppose you won't
be wanting this today.

349
00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:10,013
I know what you're doing.

350
00:27:10,097 --> 00:27:12,048
And what is that?

351
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:17,337
You--heh heh-- you don't
believe in me anymore.

352
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:24,277
Of course I do.

353
00:27:26,314 --> 00:27:30,700
Then we--we don't need--

354
00:27:30,785 --> 00:27:33,853
we don't need this.

355
00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:36,406
Praise Jesus.

356
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,209
It's wonderful.

357
00:27:40,795 --> 00:27:43,963
I'll pour it out, then.

358
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,036
Y-you can't.

359
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:53,973
I--I'll have one last drink.

360
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,957
Ahh...

361
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:36,099
Let's go to Mexico, boys.

362
00:28:36,183 --> 00:28:37,550
Right now.
Whoa.

363
00:28:37,618 --> 00:28:40,653
Slow down there, son.

364
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:44,190
We'll take a paddle steamer
to Louisiana.

365
00:28:44,258 --> 00:28:46,259
Texas-New Orleans railroad
from there to Galveston.

366
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,895
Hell, it ain't but a 300-mile
ride to Mexico from there.

367
00:28:48,963 --> 00:28:50,763
That's a good idea.

368
00:28:50,815 --> 00:28:53,366
Right after we take down
another train.

369
00:28:53,434 --> 00:28:57,487
We got enough money.

370
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:59,772
Besides, they're expecting us.

371
00:28:59,824 --> 00:29:02,575
The guard on that last train
was waiting for us.

372
00:29:02,626 --> 00:29:05,378
You scared, Bohannon?

373
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:07,714
Is that it?

374
00:29:11,051 --> 00:29:14,954
You're treading
on some skinny ice, son.

375
00:29:17,475 --> 00:29:20,460
You want to do this,
Mississippi?

376
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:31,070
Why didn't you draw down
on that darkie?

377
00:29:33,574 --> 00:29:36,693
Just the way
it played out, I guess.

378
00:29:41,982 --> 00:29:43,917
All right.

379
00:29:43,984 --> 00:29:46,786
One more train.

380
00:29:46,837 --> 00:29:49,255
Then we go to Mexico.

381
00:29:54,628 --> 00:29:57,764
Cullen Bohannon is robbing my
trains and you didn't kill him?

382
00:29:57,831 --> 00:30:01,601
You hired me to protect your
payroll and that's what I done.

383
00:30:01,685 --> 00:30:03,836
Yes, you did at that.

384
00:30:03,888 --> 00:30:05,638
Maybe I could do more
for you, Mr. Durant.

385
00:30:05,689 --> 00:30:07,140
More?

386
00:30:07,191 --> 00:30:10,360
This town's goin'
to hell in a handbasket.

387
00:30:10,444 --> 00:30:11,778
Your point is?

388
00:30:11,845 --> 00:30:14,847
I'm the man
that could fix things.

389
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:18,735
I have no doubt you are up
to the job, Mr. Ferguson.

390
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:20,853
But it's not as simple
as all that.

391
00:30:20,905 --> 00:30:23,623
Maybe if I was
a few shades lighter?

392
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:27,026
I won't lie to you--yes.

393
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:29,879
I can do it.

394
00:30:29,964 --> 00:30:32,865
All I need is a chance.

395
00:30:34,718 --> 00:30:37,470
Let me think about it.

396
00:30:37,538 --> 00:30:40,723
Appreciate that.

397
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:49,025
Bohannon.

398
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,717
I should have known.

399
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:56,222
Another brick on
his road to hell.

400
00:31:06,102 --> 00:31:08,038
The man did this
would be dead already

401
00:31:08,142 --> 00:31:10,777
if the Swede
was still running things.

402
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:12,070
I miss him.

403
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,070
The Swede put a thumpin'
on you, Nell.

404
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,994
Hell, that was just business.

405
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,402
You think I don't beat on my
girls when they hold out on me?

406
00:31:18,453 --> 00:31:22,456
That man ran this shithole
of a town like a fine watch.

407
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,408
Well, it's
your lucky day, Nell.

408
00:31:24,459 --> 00:31:26,276
'Cause that's why
me and Mickey are here.

409
00:31:26,328 --> 00:31:28,946
How the hell are you two
skinny chaps

410
00:31:28,997 --> 00:31:31,298
gonna protect my knocking shop?

411
00:31:31,383 --> 00:31:32,633
Give us a chance.

412
00:31:32,717 --> 00:31:34,752
What have you got to lose?

413
00:31:34,803 --> 00:31:36,637
We're in, boyo.

414
00:31:36,721 --> 00:31:39,640
Same deal as the Swede--
10% of the take,

415
00:31:39,724 --> 00:31:41,342
after expenses.

416
00:31:41,426 --> 00:31:42,593
That's great.

417
00:31:42,644 --> 00:31:44,228
There's one small catch.

418
00:31:44,295 --> 00:31:45,479
You have to kill that man
that did her dollymop.

419
00:31:45,563 --> 00:31:47,564
What?

420
00:31:49,234 --> 00:31:50,901
I ain't no killer.

421
00:31:50,969 --> 00:31:53,637
Mick, that's what you said
in Boston.

422
00:31:53,688 --> 00:31:56,740
But that was different.

423
00:31:56,808 --> 00:31:59,994
Things...got out of hand.

424
00:32:02,831 --> 00:32:05,032
I ain't a killer.

425
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:24,468
Cullen, you need to get on
this horse

426
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:28,472
and ride away from here
as fast as you can.

427
00:32:28,523 --> 00:32:32,676
Them Alabama boys are none too
happy with you right about now.

428
00:32:32,727 --> 00:32:35,112
Doc...

429
00:32:39,484 --> 00:32:42,236
If you'll excuse me,
I got a train to rob.

430
00:32:52,247 --> 00:32:55,699
Cullen, this ain't
gonna end well.

431
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,535
It rarely does.

432

Watches in the bag.

463
00:36:14,365 --> 00:36:16,399
I know you got a watch.
Don't give me that.

464
00:36:16,451 --> 00:36:19,920
You know, man it smell
like Yankee in here, don't it?

465
00:36:20,004 --> 00:36:21,738
Ma'am, I need you to put
that purse in this bag.

466
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:25,408
Take the ring off your finger!

467
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,760
Hurry up!

468
00:36:26,844 --> 00:36:28,011
I'm gonna put a hole
in your boy's head

469
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,347
if you don't give me that ring.

470
00:36:30,414 --> 00:36:31,715
Hurry up!

471
00:36:31,766 --> 00:36:33,884
Hurry up! Try harder!

472
00:36:33,935 --> 00:36:35,936
You want a dead child
in your lap?

473
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,222
I will kill this Yankee spawn.

474
00:36:38,273 --> 00:36:40,057
Take that ring off your finger!

475
00:36:40,108 --> 00:36:41,591
Get that ring off your finger!

476
00:36:41,643 --> 00:36:43,110
Do you want this boy to die?!

477
00:36:43,194 --> 00:36:45,529
You better stand down, son.

478
00:36:45,596 --> 00:36:47,931
Last chance.

479
00:36:49,934 --> 00:36:53,120
No. It's yours.

480
00:37:04,448 --> 00:37:05,966
Hey.

481
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,784
Shit.

482
00:37:15,265 --> 00:37:17,283
They're watching us.

483
00:37:18,985 --> 00:37:21,036
I can feel it.

484
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:24,408
After what happened
to you and Robert,

485
00:37:24,528 --> 00:37:28,244
I can understand your unease.

486
00:37:28,295 --> 00:37:30,731
We surveyed this area.

487
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:33,731
The Sioux believe the land
across that river

488
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:34,981
is sacred...

489
00:37:36,266 --> 00:37:38,807
Where the earth touches heaven.

490
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:44,593
Robert wanted to avoid it.

491
00:37:44,644 --> 00:37:48,264
What do you think?

492
00:37:48,315 --> 00:37:53,819
My husband was rarely wrong
on these matters.

493
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:57,656
I know they're over there
waiting for us.

494
00:37:57,741 --> 00:37:59,474
We can't ignore them.

495
00:37:59,526 --> 00:38:02,328
But they will be
the least of our troubles

496
00:38:02,412 --> 00:38:05,698
if we don't get
this railroad under control.

497
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,464
Unless you got a bee
in your throat,

498
00:38:23,584 --> 00:38:27,002
best cease that hum sound.

499
00:38:29,773 --> 00:38:32,775
A happy man's got a right
to hum, all right?

500
00:38:32,842 --> 00:38:37,062
Son, you're getting set
to be hanged.

501
00:38:38,481 --> 00:38:43,152
Nah, they won't hang me.

502
00:38:43,203 --> 00:38:45,788
Shoot me, most likely.

503
00:38:53,863 --> 00:38:55,197
Ha ha ha ha ha!

504
00:38:55,248 --> 00:38:58,200
♪ Take me home
to the land of cotton ♪

505
00:38:58,251 --> 00:39:01,637
♪ old times there
are not forgotten ♪

506
00:39:01,704 --> 00:39:05,174
♪ look away, look away

507
00:39:05,225 --> 00:39:06,981
♪ look away...

508
00:39:07,101 --> 00:39:08,715
♪ Dixieland

509
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:14,717
Shut up.

510
00:39:24,094 --> 00:39:26,512
I don't...

511
00:39:26,596 --> 00:39:29,648
I don't know what to say
about this.

512
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:33,068
Whore. Hmm?

513
00:39:34,988 --> 00:39:40,242
Well, it was a whore who...

514
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:45,247
Bathed the feet of Jesus
with--with her hair.

515
00:39:46,866 --> 00:39:49,368
Yeah. Amen.

516
00:39:56,126 --> 00:39:58,160
Huh?

517
00:40:01,765 --> 00:40:03,665
Yah.

518
00:40:03,717 --> 00:40:06,685
Uh...

519
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:14,310
Father, accept this whore
into the ground

520
00:40:14,361 --> 00:40:17,780
so that her corruption
may be completed.

521
00:40:17,847 --> 00:40:21,784
May her soul
be eternally forgotten.

522
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:28,190
May we be cleansed
of her memory.

523
00:40:28,258 --> 00:40:30,367
Yah.

524
00:40:30,487 --> 00:40:34,880
These things in your name.
Humbly.

525
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:39,218
Amen.

526
00:40:39,302 --> 00:40:42,371
Amen.

527
00:40:44,257 --> 00:40:47,209
Dig! Dig.

528
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,644
New graves, sir.

529
00:40:48,711 --> 00:40:53,015
Many new graves.

530
00:40:53,066 --> 00:40:54,817
We shall plant our--

531
00:40:54,884 --> 00:40:58,854
our strange crop,

532
00:40:58,905 --> 00:41:01,023
and the lord...

533
00:41:01,074 --> 00:41:02,825
The lord...

534
00:41:02,892 --> 00:41:08,230
will pour forth
his bounty upon us.

535
00:42:09,792 --> 00:42:12,561
Hey, Johnny Reb!

536
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:17,632
Time to wake up!

537
00:42:17,684 --> 00:42:20,602
You better start
singin' "Dixie."

538
00:42:20,653 --> 00:42:23,572
'Cause you're next!

539
00:42:25,575 --> 00:42:27,743
Aim...

540
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:29,495
Fire!

541
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:30,913
Aah!

542
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:06,740
