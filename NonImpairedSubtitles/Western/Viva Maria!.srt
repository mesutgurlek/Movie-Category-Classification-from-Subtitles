1
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,114
She was only a little girl

2
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:36,561
When her Irish father

3
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:41,998
Gave her dynamite

4
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:46,938
To blow up the British

5
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:52,304
It's Christmas all over London

6
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:56,476
The little girl didn't tremble

7
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,146
Her father's hiding in the dark

8
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:06,014
Criminal or lover of justice

9
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:15,091
What a dreadful life
What a destiny for a child

10
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:19,867
She should have never left Dublin

11
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:27,610
Will the fierce rock of Gibraltar

12
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:32,647
Undergo the same fate?

13
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:37,147
What does she have in her mouth?

14
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,720
Isn't it a cord of dynamite?

15
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:48,093
The Irish girl has grown up

16
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,762
She has become pretty

17
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,772
But why this slaughter?

18
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,503
The madness of Anglophobia

19
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:08,017
They reached America

20
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:12,157
to escape their oppressors

21
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:18,594
Against the British Empire

22
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:23,625
They carry on their fight

23
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:29,171
But fanatics will never

24
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:33,075
have the last word

25
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,910
No, fanatics will never

26
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:43,715
have the last word

27
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,855
Open fire.

28
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,601
Hello, old boy.

29
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,477
Did you see that young boy on the way?

30
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,283
Not a sight, not a sight.

31
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,347
Keep your eyes skinned,
he may turn up anywhere.

32
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:42,189
Watch out, he might be coming on the train.

33
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,970
James! James!

34
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,740
James, don't leave me. Listen to me, James.

35
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,777
If you leave me, I'II... Don't go.

36
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,812
I love you, I love you.

37
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,084
I love you. Don't leave me.
Don't leave me. James!

38
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,132
My world is finished.

39
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:16,783
Janine!

40
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:57,260
Go. You're much too young
for this sort of thing.

41
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,026
- But, Mother...
- Be quiet. Do as you're told.

42
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,359
Marie.

43
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:07,390
You shouldn't shut yourself up
in there all alone.

44
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,899
Why don't you share my caravan?

45
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,394
You're very kind, Rodolfo...

46
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:15,065
but I've got to face this by myself.

47
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,899
All right, fellows, let's get on with it.

48
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:16,952
More.

49
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,796
I told you to stay away from that window.

50
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,177
- Was she your sister?
- No.

51
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,077
She was my partner.

52
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,245
Are you French?

53
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,152
English.

54
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,590
I'm Irish.

55
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,697
I was born in Dublin.

56
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,824
In the central prison.

57
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,560
I had to obey and I did.

58
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,965
Blew it all up:

59
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,065
The bridge, the soldiers...

60
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,108
and my father.

61
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,243
They always wind up like that.

62
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,175
- I'm afraid it runs in the family.
- Runs in the family?

63
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,782
You see this?

64
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,792
My people have been fighting
the English for a very long time.

65
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,991
My great-grandfather died at Waterloo.

66
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,661
But he was on the French side.

67
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,567
His three sons were shot for treason
by the English...

68
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,935
in front of the cathedral at Cork.

69
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,474
My mother was French.

70
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,841
She died two years after I was born,
in Glasgow...

71
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,448
in the year they sank the Livingstone
with my Uncle Mike.

72
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:46,814
Remember?

73
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:51,555
If they'd waited 10 minutes,
they could've got the Prince of Wales, too.

74
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,956
The Prince of Wales.

75
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,786
His beard smelled of eau de cologne.

76
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,327
- He is a friend of yours?
- No.

77
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,098
In Paris, he once came backstage, walked
right up to me and he gave me a kiss.

78
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:08,102
I was already a star and only 15.

79
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,707
Look.

80
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,843
That's when I tried drama.

81
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,504
I did all the classics:

82
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,709
Romeo and Juliet, Othello, East Lynnet.

83
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,514
Now I just sing.

84
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,283
Nothing's like music hall.

85
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,855
It's the greatest training you can get.

86
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:36,098
- Is acting an interesting life?
- Of course, it's the best.

87
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,103
If you like to travel.

88
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,707
Music hall is beautiful.

89
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,675
You don't happen to dance?

90
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,784
Did you ever try to sing?

91
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,212
Of course, in the choir.

92
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,887
One day, I tried to use powder.

93
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,760
Papa grabbed the puff and slapped me
on both cheeks.

94
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,458
No more powder.

95
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,768
We use lots of makeup.

96
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,000
Kills stage fright.

97
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,604
If you paint it on thick enough,
you don't feel scared.

98
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:21,269
- Scared of what?
- All those people out there.

99
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,807
The men who stare.

100
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,881
Well, I'm not afraid of men. You'll see.

101
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,580
Do you know any?

102
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:32,815
I guess not.

103
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,865
How frightful not to be able...

104
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,595
to get a decent cup of tea in this country.

105
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:49,774
My dear Johnson, if the water isn't good,
what can you expect of the tea?

106
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:06,453
Lace it with a bit of brandy.
That'll cheer it up.

107
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,160
- Passport, please.
- Yes.

108
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,596
We're looking for a terrorist.

109
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,931
A young chap.
Haven't seen anybody, have you?

110
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,237
Good gracious, no, not a soul.

111
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,690
Don't wake her up.

112
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,327
What's happening?

113
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:57,368
Relax. We've left the British Empire behind.

114
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:04,938
- Who is that girl?
- Who is that Englishman?

115
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:09,308
Rodolfo, come here
and meet my new partner.

116
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,818
Oh, that's right.
I don't even know your name.

117
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,823
- Marie Fitzgerald O'Malley.
- Marie?

118
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,317
Mary?

119
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,327
I'm not Mary. Marie.

120
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,123
Mary and Mary.

121
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,393
That's splendid.

122
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:08,923
You could try a little harder.

123
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,827
Help me!

124
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,340
My God, they are so vulgar.

125
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:03,554
What's the house like tonight?

126
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,522
Oh, as usual.

127
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:08,555
They're not too bad. Could be worse.

128
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:09,651
Go on, once more:

129
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:12,526
And being drunk on too much champagne

130
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,794
Discovering this gallant heaven

131
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,028
- Two minutes, girls.
- Already?

132
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,097
- Darn!
- What is it?

133
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,903
I can't remember how it begins.

134
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,809
We sang of the sweetness of the tropics.

135
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,770
We sang of Venice and its gondolas.

136
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,508
We sang of the British grass.

137
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:40,949
But there is nothing like Paris.

138
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:04,266
We sang of the sweetness of the tropics

139
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:08,472
We sang of Venice and its gondolas

140
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,844
We sang of the British grass

141
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:17,145
But there's nothing like Paris

142
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,554
- You all right?
- Guess so.

143
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,718
It's such a stupid song.

144
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:26,897
Pretty white stockings and black garters

145
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:30,228
Pretty coquettes with high boots

146
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:35,829
Sweet darlings in frilly lace

147
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:39,838
This is Paris

148
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:43,378
This is Paris

149
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,282
- I have a problem.
- Shut up and sing.

150
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,419
We sang of Geneva and its mountains

151
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:03,127
We sang of Verona and its lovers

152
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:07,965
We sang of the guitars of Spain

153
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:11,403
But Paris will always win

154
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:15,070
Fleeting glimpses of women

155
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:19,378
Suzon, Fanchon, Lisette, or Nini

156
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:23,417
Elegant ladies or housemaids

157
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:42,300
- What'll I do now?
- Well, do the same thing.

158
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:46,877
In every corner of our old Paris

159
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:50,914
From the Eiffel Tower to the Opera

160
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:55,281
From the Moulin Rouge
to Boulogne and Notre Dame

161
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,783
There's always a heart beating

162
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:03,353
Laundress or granny

163
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:09,390
Bejeweled ladies

164
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:15,496
Seamstress and heiress, too

165
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:19,909
This is Paris

166
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:24,305
This is Paris

167
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:41,462
If you come from Norway or China

168
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:46,866
From the Transvaal or Montenegro

169
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:51,074
Whether you come from Egypt or Argentina

170
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:56,747
You'll feel at home on the Trocadero

171
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:35,885
Like being drunk on too much champagne

172
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:42,692
Discovering this gallant heaven

173
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:49,833
In love there is always a winner

174
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:54,500
Because Paris will always be Paris

175
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:59,542
Because Paris will always be Paris

176
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:30,006
This will revolutionize show business.

177
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,637
If Papa could see me now.

178
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:39,879
Go get some clothes on,
I'll take you to the ball.

179
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:22,252
I don't know how to dance, I'm sorry.

180
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,632
I'd like a drink.

181
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,280
So that's liquor?

182
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,791
I like it.

183
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:09,596
You little scamp.

184
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:12,040
But, Mother, I'm 17 and a half.

185
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,841
Drunk at your age.
You've plenty of time for that later.

186
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,184
What is Rodolfo doing?

187
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:27,088
He's inventing the perfect weapon,
a gun with a crooking barrel...

188
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,887
so he can shoot around corners.

189
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,723
It's an obsession.

190
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:34,387
What a pity.

191
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,758
He's kind of nice for an Englishman.

192
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,956
Werther, it's our waltz.

193
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,624
Ja, our waltz.

194
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,252
What did he say?

195
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,720
He spoke to me of love.

196
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:33,584
I might've known.

197
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,586
I'm not sure what love is.

198
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,891
But I'm dying to be educated.

199
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,694
Love is marvelous.

200
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,391
Look at Madame Diogène.

201
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:48,595
Werther, I feel like I'm floating on air.

202
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,945
Pleasant dreams.

203
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,716
Aren't you girls going to bed?

204
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,656
Listen, one month ago in Porto Visto...

205
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:10,387
Janine, poor Janine...

206
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:15,058
showed me a man standing on a balcony...

207
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:18,301
who was devouring my every move.

208
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:21,563
He was Spanish, but he acted French.

209
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:25,808
At my curtain call,
he tore the flower from his lapel...

210
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:29,277
threw it at my feet, then left without a word.

211
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,177
You'll never believe it...

212
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:38,822
but this went on after every performance
for one whole week.

213
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,422
- Was he handsome?
- In a way.

214
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:46,054
He was more distinguished.

215
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:47,528
All man.

216
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,458
Hard to resist.

217
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:06,072
So the last night, I picked up his flower
and threw it back to him.

218
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:07,776
He understood.

219
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:12,084
He took me to supper. He was very correct
and gallant in all things...

220
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:14,252
a little awkward.

221
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,557
Go on.

222
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:23,364
We had to leave
by the next morning at dawn.

223
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,500
When I left, he was still asleep.

224
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:32,638
- I didn't even wake him.
- Why didn't you stay with him?

225
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:35,301
I hardly knew him. Are you mad?

226
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:02,134
That's how it is. That's show business.

227
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,605
Here today, gone tomorrow.

228
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:15,650
Still, if I ever do meet the man of my life...

229
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:18,922
I'm sure I'll know him at first sight.

230
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,114
What do you take me for?

231
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:17,242
Marie isn't back yet.

232
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,010
Mary? No.

233
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,061
Come on, come on.

234
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,331
Good morning.

235
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,711
I'm bushed.

236
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,483
You were right.

237
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,556
Love is too marvelous for words.

238
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:16,085
You left my life for no reason

239
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,919
You left my sight for no reason

240
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:23,923
In the fountain

241
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:30,466
In the fountain where the peacock slept

242
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,783
In the fountain where the peacock slept

243
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:39,113
You can chose between

244
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:42,052
two legs or two eyes

245
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,552
One must always have two

246
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,961
to seek a fortune

247
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:53,162
But blonde or brunette

248
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:56,237
In Paris they are better

249
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:59,303
One equals two

250
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:02,573
And two makes only one

251
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,516
Ah! Women
Parisian women

252
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:19,423
I multiply one

253
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:21,396
I multiply two

254
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:25,424
It's unfortunate
that they are such a problem

255
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:28,968
Ten times or a hundred times
It's too dangerous

256
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,104
God have mercy

257
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,903
Get rid of them both

258
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:37,578
Ah! Women
Parisian women

259
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:48,753
Holding a grudge

260
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,951
won't make you happy

261
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:54,827
Say goodbye

262
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:58,459
Because two is one too much

263
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:02,035
There's only one head left

264
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:04,639
Ah, no, there are two

265
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:07,433
Every one

266
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:11,174
will find his one

267
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,805
Lost a glove

268
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:14,872
A run in my stocking

269
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:18,743
My petticoats are in rags

270
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:23,745
Make no mistake, this stripping onstage...

271
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,182
doesn't help this wardrobe.

272
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:30,954
It's incredible.

273
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,757
The fashions have changed again in Paris.

274
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:39,531
- You don't care, do you?
- Not a whit.

275
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,372
I suppose you're right at that.

276
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:53,014
You are quite happy as you are?

277
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,814
Quite happy. You're not?

278
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:58,320
Me, happy? I don't know.

279
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:01,223
Do you understand? I'm bored.

280
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:04,154
You can't call these rubes a real public.

281
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:05,889
Country bumpkins.

282
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:07,957
What's the matter?

283
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:09,862
You're getting homesick?

284
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:50,605
Dirty blackguards.

285
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:51,902
The brutes.

286
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:13,152
Good shot, indeed!

287
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:28,378
Forgive me, please. I had to do something.

288
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:52,132
Ladies, what an unexpected pleasure.

289
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,538
And what unexpected marksmanship.

290
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:31,732
Welcome, Señor Florès.

291
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:50,020
Do we know each other?

292
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,754
My name is Florès.

293
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:54,626
I spoke to you one night.

294
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:57,727
When? Where?

295
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:01,466
Doesn't matter. It meant nothing to you.

296
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:38,002
All around me, I could see only misery...

297
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:41,435
injustice, and brutality.

298
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:44,804
And so I left my village.

299
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,413
I rode though the countryside.

300
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,253
I spoke to the villagers, and they listened.

301
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,346
Some of them joined me.

302
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:56,225
We had but a few weapons among us.

303
00:49:56,893 --> 00:50:00,556
Most of them were captured or killed.

304
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:05,598
For two months,
I have been running from Rodriguez.

305
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:09,933
With a price on my head,
I know what to expect.

306
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:14,672
But what's it all for?

307
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,806
The revolution.

308
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:31,254
Well, what are you going to do with us?

309
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,920
Señor Rodriguez will decide.

310
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:37,398
Tomorrow, he will let you know.

311
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:04,024
Sleep, now. The sandman has passed.

312
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:13,159
You still smoking?

313
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,683
You're wasting your time with 12-caliber.

314
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,726
The casing's too short.

315
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:41,096
Try upping it to 30.
You'll increase your range.

316
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:18,412
Rodriguez!

317
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,941
They took both girls away.

318
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:21,374
What for?

319
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:26,882
With a man like Rodriguez,
we must expect anything.

320
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,668
Oh, it's the new Vickers.

321
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:58,481
Not quite, Mademoiselle.

322
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:01,880
It's the Skyton-Babbit, 1907.

323
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:04,109
The latest model.

324
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:13,687
I see that you are interested in guns.

325
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:16,732
Enough to be able to shoot my men.

326
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:19,759
Do you know who you are dealing with?

327
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:22,669
I have electricity. Padre.

328
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:29,236
I am the only one
within a radius of 50 miles.

329
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,072
Look.

330
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:06,507
Good.

331
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,320
I'm not a brute.

332
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:21,225
I am very modern.

333
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,668
I love art...

334
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:28,630
especially the School of Paris.

335
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,276
My little Parisians.

336
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:37,675
Now I'll teach you a little game.

337
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:10,878
That music...

338
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:14,612
The Lady in White.

339
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:17,319
What does it mean?

340
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:20,117
That means they are going to die...

341
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:23,024
but before they die...

342
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:52,505
Grant them eternal rest, O Lord...

343
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,542
and may everlasting light shine upon them.

344
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:56,694
Good.

345
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,138
Come here.

346
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:01,641
Come here.

347
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:12,142
Ah, you have certainly
messed that up, my son.

348
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,057
Look out!

349
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:05,655
I'm going to die. Take me back to my village.

350
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:31,483
What are we going to do
when we do get to the other side?

351
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:34,315
We told you already.

352
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:36,449
We are going to take Florès home.

353
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:39,289
For the moment, we've two objectives:

354
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:42,123
To give Rodriguez and his men the slip...

355
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:49,367
and to keep ourselves fed.

356
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,818
Shit! Notre Dame!

357
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,241
- You'll be home in a few hours.
- Maria...

358
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,085
No, don't speak.

359
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:16,613
- Maria, I am dying.
- Don't say that, please.

360
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:19,354
No, listen to me, Maria.

361
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:22,395
Continue with my cause when I'm dead.

362
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:26,258
- Swear to me you'll go on fighting.
- Fighting, me?

363
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:28,860
- Florès, how could I?
- Go on, swear.

364
01:08:31,207 --> 01:08:32,572
Yes.

365
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:34,170
I swear.

366
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:41,508
I swear it.

367
01:08:49,391 --> 01:08:50,824
There it is.

368
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:44,270
Hurry. Quick.

369
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,324
The doctor is not home.

370
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,994
- They have all gone.
- That is strange.

371
01:09:59,094 --> 01:10:00,994
The village is completely deserted.

372
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,304
Rodolfo!

373
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:22,345
He's getting worse. What can we do?

374
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:28,188
Ave Maria

375
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:33,261
Long live the rosary

376
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:38,432
Long live Saint Dominic

377
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:43,137
That he founded

378
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:47,136
Ave Maria

379
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:49,575
Well, there are your villagers.

380
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:53,871
He has a family here. He will speak to them.

381
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:06,789
Mama.

382
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:11,229
Dolores.

383
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:13,967
What are you doing here, Domingo?

384
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:21,272
Did you come to see your wife?

385
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,377
Your mother?

386
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:25,470
Your children?

387
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:30,214
Or did you forget that you left them here...

388
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:32,382
left them alone...

389
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,386
to follow your hero Florès...

390
01:11:35,557 --> 01:11:39,254
like a dog, loyal and stupid.

391
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:40,993
Get out!

392
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:43,426
Get out and do not come back.

393
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:45,598
All of you.

394
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:48,868
There is no place for you here.

395
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:54,471
All of you followed Florès...

396
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:57,510
down the path of crime and revolution.

397
01:11:58,347 --> 01:12:00,178
Now go back to him...

398
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:02,607
wherever he is hiding...

399
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:05,886
and tell him never to return again.

400
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:08,483
Florès was alive.

401
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:11,759
I loved him.

402
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:18,595
Florès is dead.

403
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:20,425
I mourn him.

404
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:31,939
I am not here to revenge one man...

405
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:35,212
but to bring a nation justice.

406
01:12:36,118 --> 01:12:37,847
What is she up to?

407
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,818
It's her big scene.

408
01:12:44,326 --> 01:12:46,089
Florès is dead.

409
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:50,324
His last noble thoughts were for you.

410
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:52,860
These will I now undertake...

411
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:55,370
to faithfully transmit.

412
01:12:57,306 --> 01:12:59,001
Yet what do I see?

413
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:02,874
A flock of lowly sheep...

414
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:05,778
who cringe and dare not raise their heads.

415
01:13:08,584 --> 01:13:10,211
Oh, judgment...

416
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:13,552
thou art fled to brutish beasts.

417
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:17,323
Alas, have all men then lost their reason?

418
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:19,923
Shakespeare, Julius Caesar.

419
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:22,053
Act 3, Scene 2.

420
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:25,892
Are you not exploited, degraded, whipped?

421
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:28,833
Yet you say thank you...

422
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:31,370
and you bow to your oppressors.

423
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:35,006
Rise...

424
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:38,672
and freedom will answer you.

425
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:41,875
Stand up and let the mountains ring
with your anger.

426
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:44,418
Always hate, hate and more hate.

427
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:48,284
You speak like Florès, you will end like him.

428
01:13:52,327 --> 01:13:56,024
Is there any man here so base
that he is willingly a slave?

429
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,962
Let that man now speak...

430
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:03,127
for him I have offended.

431
01:14:07,242 --> 01:14:08,937
I'm waiting for an answer.

432
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,203
She was very good.

433
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:45,200
Congratulations.

434
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:46,864
Quite a show.

435
01:15:49,778 --> 01:15:52,338
Everybody thought you were sublime.

436
01:15:53,916 --> 01:15:56,043
Madame Diogène was about to cry.

437
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:02,587
All I felt for you was shame.

438
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:06,419
I've done as Florès requested.

439
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:08,827
Don't you dare speak of Florès.

440
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:24,675
So what do you expect to do?

441
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:26,771
I have sworn to carry on the revolution.

442
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:28,406
The revolution?

443
01:16:30,285 --> 01:16:31,809
You're a fool.

444
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:33,349
Perhaps.

445
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:36,290
And how? With who?

446
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:37,723
With them.

447
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:44,821
But stop and think.
You are only courting trouble.

448
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:47,027
I've already given my word.

449
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:51,529
Well, don't count on me.

450
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:42,843
Give me your lighter.

451
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:45,916
She doesn't have a chance.

452
01:19:28,663 --> 01:19:30,290
Climb up there and cover me.

453
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:31,696
All right.

454
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:37,938
Don't move! Stay where you are.

455
01:19:43,178 --> 01:19:45,009
Shoot anything that moves.

456
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:48,106
You others keep cover. I'll take care of this.

457
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:28,222
Thank you, Marie.

458
01:24:30,465 --> 01:24:32,524
The pleasure was all mine.

459
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:46,973
Well, it looks to me
as if we've got ourselves into a revolution.

460
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:50,384
What did you say? It's a revolution?

461
01:24:51,052 --> 01:24:52,849
It is now.

462
01:25:24,919 --> 01:25:27,251
Take me to the Father Superior.

463
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:32,255
The Father Superior.

464
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:42,097
- Domine benedictu.
- Padre!

465
01:25:50,111 --> 01:25:52,875
- What happened, my son?
- Maria.

466
01:25:55,016 --> 01:25:56,210
Maria?

467
01:25:56,651 --> 01:26:00,451
No. Maria and Maria. Two.

468
01:26:00,555 --> 01:26:03,524
- The revolution.
- Two?

469
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:29,367
The revolution?

470
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:32,040
Led by two women?

471
01:27:58,506 --> 01:28:01,634
To arms, citizens, form your battalions.

472
01:28:01,709 --> 01:28:05,736
March! March!
Before an impure blood floods our fields.

473
01:28:15,456 --> 01:28:16,889
This is our infirmary.

474
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:42,747
We have no intention
of attacking the United States.

475
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:48,284
On the contrary, we respect your country...

476
01:28:48,356 --> 01:28:50,051
liberal and modern.

477
01:29:02,770 --> 01:29:06,570
However, your government has to realize...

478
01:29:06,808 --> 01:29:10,073
that here we are still in the Middle Ages.

479
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:13,912
Are you aware
that the whole nation of San Miguel...

480
01:29:13,981 --> 01:29:18,748
- still belongs to 14 families?
- Then you are against private property?

481
01:29:19,821 --> 01:29:22,381
Private property is highway robbery.

482
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:33,557
We won't give up our fight
until the dictator is eliminated.

483
01:29:39,507 --> 01:29:40,804
Our army.

484
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:43,510
Sit over there, please.

485
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:52,883
The viaduct at Barharen. Interesting.

486
01:29:55,923 --> 01:29:57,356
And then what?

487
01:29:57,425 --> 01:30:00,121
I also blew up the prison in Palmares...

488
01:30:00,695 --> 01:30:02,856
the bridge at Los Andos...

489
01:30:03,297 --> 01:30:05,458
the cathedral in Chicacao...

490
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:07,892
the mines at Totonicapan.

491
01:30:10,104 --> 01:30:12,732
Our objective is now the capital.

492
01:30:29,557 --> 01:30:31,889
They have blown up my statue.

493
01:30:33,327 --> 01:30:34,988
Send out our special armored train.

494
01:30:36,631 --> 01:30:38,826
You mean the train of death?

495
01:30:39,367 --> 01:30:40,356
Yes.

496
01:32:50,898 --> 01:32:52,058
What?

497
01:32:54,001 --> 01:32:55,901
You're a fool.

498
01:32:57,305 --> 01:33:00,570
All is not lost. Our fight has just begun.

499
01:33:53,694 --> 01:33:58,529
THE LIBERATOR

500
01:35:11,172 --> 01:35:12,571
THE LADIES OF PARIS

501
01:35:40,034 --> 01:35:42,400
Now they're performing miracles.

502
01:35:46,474 --> 01:35:47,873
Sacrilege!

503
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:02,222
Padre, what'll I do now?

504
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:06,552
This affair no longer concerns you.

505
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:09,019
Leave it to me.

506
01:36:24,211 --> 01:36:25,872
It's a message from Pablo.

507
01:36:25,946 --> 01:36:28,437
He will meet us up north, with 600 guns.

508
01:36:28,516 --> 01:36:29,949
And if all goes well...

509
01:36:30,017 --> 01:36:33,077
tomorrow, at the break of dawn,
all of us will attack San Miguel.

510
01:36:55,242 --> 01:36:59,269
- Can I help you, Padre?
- You may conduct me to Maria and Maria.

511
01:37:24,972 --> 01:37:27,702
We're alone, as you requested.

512
01:37:27,775 --> 01:37:30,471
- What do you want?
- We know who you are.

513
01:37:30,544 --> 01:37:34,105
- You hold the power to...
- I'm the servant of the Lord.

514
01:37:34,248 --> 01:37:35,545
But you...

515
01:37:35,616 --> 01:37:37,641
you profaned our sacred rites.

516
01:37:37,718 --> 01:37:40,846
Shrines are raised in your honor
by the peasants.

517
01:37:40,921 --> 01:37:43,355
Are not the two of you
worshiped like saints?

518
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:45,949
- They want revolution.
- No.

519
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:47,952
They want chaos...

520
01:37:48,028 --> 01:37:49,586
and violence...

521
01:37:50,397 --> 01:37:51,830
and scandal.

522
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:05,344
Show your hand. What do you want?

523
01:38:07,414 --> 01:38:09,211
My task is difficult.

524
01:38:09,316 --> 01:38:11,546
Who knows? God may be on your side.

525
01:38:11,619 --> 01:38:14,679
- Do you doubt it?
- No man is ever sure.

526
01:38:18,759 --> 01:38:21,023
He sometimes appears to us...

527
01:38:22,096 --> 01:38:23,927
just when we least expect.

528
01:38:31,405 --> 01:38:34,772
We'll bring down San Miguel tomorrow,
whatever the cost.

529
01:38:34,842 --> 01:38:36,241
Is that so?

530
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:49,683
Help us to see the light,
oh, Lord, lest we err.

531
01:38:51,392 --> 01:38:54,327
Padre, what exactly are you getting at?

532
01:39:02,002 --> 01:39:04,436
Reach for heaven, my daughters.

533
01:39:43,811 --> 01:39:44,800
Damn!

534
01:39:50,517 --> 01:39:51,677
We must warn Pablo.

535
01:40:49,643 --> 01:40:51,941
We do not wish to do you harm.

536
01:40:52,513 --> 01:40:56,074
If you'll just sign the paper
in which you recognize your errors...

537
01:40:56,150 --> 01:40:59,244
we shall put it on the walls
of the churches...

538
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,681
and order shall be restored.

539
01:41:03,157 --> 01:41:06,718
- But then you must leave the country.
- No! No! No!

540
01:41:30,551 --> 01:41:34,009
Pablo, they have been taken prisoner.
We must attack.

541
01:43:33,373 --> 01:43:36,934
Come, come! Hurry, my children.

542
01:43:37,077 --> 01:43:38,544
Hurry, quickly.

543
01:44:20,687 --> 01:44:22,086
Oh, I am sorry.

544
01:44:22,155 --> 01:44:25,215
Nobody has used any
of this equipment in ages.

545
01:45:17,044 --> 01:45:19,979
Go shoot those two women at once.

546
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:37,062
No. I protest.

547
01:45:37,531 --> 01:45:39,795
They're the property of the church.

548
01:46:28,415 --> 01:46:30,406
Now we'll see if it works.

549
01:48:38,178 --> 01:48:43,115
SAN MIGUEL NATIONAL BANK

550
01:48:54,728 --> 01:48:56,355
Take cover, men!

551
01:50:26,319 --> 01:50:27,718
Are you afraid?

552
01:50:28,788 --> 01:50:30,551
A little, yes.

553
01:50:33,293 --> 01:50:34,726
Ready.

554
01:50:38,064 --> 01:50:39,554
Aim.

555
01:50:40,667 --> 01:50:41,861
Fire!

556
01:50:48,975 --> 01:50:50,408
Are you dead?

557
01:50:50,710 --> 01:50:52,769
No, you?

558
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:55,038
I'll kill you myself.

559
01:51:03,456 --> 01:51:05,151
So sorry, girls.

560
01:51:05,659 --> 01:51:07,684
We were almost too late.

561
01:52:40,553 --> 01:52:42,214
We've done it.

562
01:52:42,288 --> 01:52:44,848
Florès is avenged. Satisfied now?

563
01:52:45,458 --> 01:52:46,686
I just feel tired.

564
01:53:02,709 --> 01:53:04,074
I'm happy.

565
01:53:04,611 --> 01:53:06,579
So happy.

566
01:53:54,594 --> 01:53:56,084
Ah, women.

567
01:55:19,379 --> 01:55:21,506
THEY RETURNED TO EUROPE

568
01:55:21,581 --> 01:55:25,347
FROM THEN ON, EVERY NIGHT...

569
01:55:27,353 --> 01:55:30,584
On the other side of the ocean

570
01:55:30,657 --> 01:55:33,751
The two young women meet

571
01:55:33,826 --> 01:55:36,386
In the jungle of the tropics

572
01:55:40,533 --> 01:55:43,297
Together they share
thousands of adventures

573
01:55:43,536 --> 01:55:46,471
Strange and very dangerous

574
01:55:46,873 --> 01:55:49,865
Over there, over there

575
01:55:51,244 --> 01:55:55,544
The first one was dark

576
01:55:55,615 --> 01:55:59,346
And her name was Maria

577
01:55:59,752 --> 01:56:02,983
And the second one was blonde

578
01:56:03,122 --> 01:56:07,559
and her name was also

579
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:09,694
Maria
