Oh, many of my countrymen
are afraid of whites.

339

That's what I tell my kids about you.

342
00:30:46,674 --> 00:30:49,408
There are superstitious fools
among both our peoples.

343
00:30:50,077 --> 00:30:53,613
They attribute our fates to Cai
Shen riding his black tiger,

was in a sideshow tent.

380
00:35:14,366 --> 00:35:16,534
Mr. P.T. Barnum had a whole family of them.

They're mysterious and wise, industrious.

Beautiful in their way.

Oh, you can hire them, admire them,

At the rate we're going,

396
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,742
we'll have ceded the Weber Canyon
coal fields team before year's end.

That is a problem for this railroad.

399
00:36:20,822 --> 00:36:23,524
Durant's resourceful but reckless.

400
00:36:24,058 --> 00:36:26,460
He'll bring the entire U.P.
enterprise down on his head
