1
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:19,816
So this is what you boys think
I want for a birthday present, huh?

2
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:23,219
Well, like it says, boss,
she's the "toast of the Stockton waterfront. "

3
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,280
Uh-huh.

4
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,191
She's really somethin'.

5
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:30,252
Yeah.

6
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,197
The, uh, drinks are on us.

7
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:36,429
I sure appreciate this boys,
but I gotta meet Gene's train in a half hour.

8
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:40,098
Well, then let's get inside, boss.
Time's a-wastin'.

9
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:43,540
It's really very thoughtful of you boys,
but... drinks are on me!

10
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,578
Come on! Git!

11
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,112
- I'll tell you what. You go with these two boys.
- Aww!

12
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,351
I'll look around a while.
Be with you in a minute.

13
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,451
Come on.
It's party time.

14
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,864
Wanna to buy me a drink?

15
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:17,706
I will if you're Barbary Red,
the "toast of the Stockton waterfront. "

16
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:22,612
<i>She's not, but why don't you
buy her a drink anyway?</i>

17
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,099
<i>Well, now.</i>

18
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:51,769
You're just like the boys said.
You're much better than a birthday cake.

19
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:55,804
- Happy birthday, cowboy.
- Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:55,882 --> 00:02:00,785
- Girls, we're having a birthday party.
- Clint, a party!

21
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,982
- Which way?
- This way.

22
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,566
Send in a round of drinks
and see that we're not disturbed.

23
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,629
We're having a birthday party.

24
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,325
Come on, boys.
Here.

25
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,320
Here's to you, boss.

26
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,628
<i>Play us something else.
Come on, Dolly. Let's dance.</i>

27
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,843
What's the matter with you?
Come on. Get up off that-

28
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,210
Hey. What-

29
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,426
Why fight it? Just relax-

30
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,557
<i>relax-relax.</i>

31
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,520
- Well, I can't imagine why they aren't here yet.
- Maybe the train was late.

32
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,930
<i>Shh! Here they are. Light the candles.</i>

33
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:32,404
- That's one- I got two-
- Oh! Ooh, ooh, ooh! Stick to your own side!

34
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:40,603
- Where's Nick?
- I don't know. He wasn't at the station when my train came in.

35
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,148
Why didn't you wait for him?
You were supposed to make sure he got here.

36
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:47,050
- I did. I waited an hour.
- Maybe somebody bought him a birthday drink or something.

37
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,715
Oh, that's right. The boys were gonna
buy him a drink. He's probably with them.

38
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,350
<i>- Well, where'd they go?
- Oh, it could be any number of places.</i>

39
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:57,590
Well, it's not Nick's fault.
After all, he didn't know about the party.

40
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,258
If we blame anyone
it should be that, um-

41
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:05,293
<i>What's her name, Heath?
Uh, Barbary Red?</i>

42
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:08,829
<i>Nothing gets by you, does it?</i>

43
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,570
<i>- Who's she?
Polite ladies wouldn't even mention her name.</i>

44
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,374
<i>I'll try and restrain myself in the future.</i>

45
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:18,042
Well, I hope Nick can
tear himself away soon.

46
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:22,053
I think I'll go into town and find him-
bring him home for a piece of cake anyway.

47
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,259
Well, happy birthday,
Nick, wherever you are.

48
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,084
It's kind of quiet around here,
isn't it?

49
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,188
I'd always heard this was supposed
to be an exciting place.

50
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,860
Well, it's still early.
What'll it be?

51
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,028
- Is your boss around?
- Maybe.

52
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:40,214
- Hello, Barbara.
- Mr. Barkley.

53
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,751
Dolly.

54
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,923
Dolly, give him whatever he wants...

55
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:48,057
and make sure the glass is clean.

56
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,729
Mr. Barkley doesn't like
to get his fingers dirty.

57
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:56,104
Uh, I'll have a little cognac, please-

58
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:59,508
if you'll join me.

59
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:05,017
We have three drinks here:
beer, whiskey and gin.

60
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,518
Well, in that case, I'll have whiskey.

61
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,578
One whiskey.

62
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,318
Do you always make it a practice
to check up on old clients?

63
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:20,058
Now, Barbara,
I want to be your friend, really.

64
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:23,226
It's a little late for that, isn't it?

65
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:28,137
On account of you, I spent 180 days
in the house of correction, as they call it.

66
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:31,802
<i>Well, I-</i>

67
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:35,006
Now, there wasn't very much
I could do about that, was there?

68
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,676
Wasn't there?
The judge was an old friend of your family.

69
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,912
<i>You could have
fixed it up with him.</i>

70
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,148
That is not the way.

71
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,582
What do you want?

72
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,993
All right.

73
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:56,433
I want you to know that I'm sincerely sorry
about the house of correction.

74
00:08:56,502 --> 00:09:00,598
<i>- I wish I could've helped you.
- Do you really think you could've gotten me off?</i>

75
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,164
If you were innocent.

76
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:07,042
<i>What difference does it make?
You went your way, I went mine.</i>

77
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:10,810
What brings a fancy lawyer
like you to a saloon like this?

78
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,478
You want me to be honest?
You.

79
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:19,617
<i>Yeah, I've thought about you a great deal
since you walked out of my office that day.</i>

80
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,092
There were a lot of things
we didn't get a chance to say.

81
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:30,025
I... just wish we could have
gotten to know each other as...

82
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:33,401
well, man and woman
instead of client and counselor.

83
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:37,932
<i>And when I heard that you
were here in Stockton, I-</i>

84
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,535
Huh!
Well, here I am.

85
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:45,482
Get to know one another?
How would we do that, Mr. Barkley?

86
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,678
First by calling meJarrod...

87
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,914
then secondly by having lunch with me.

88
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,116
And then?

89
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,591
Well, now, I wouldn't be
much of a lawyer...

90
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,527
if I told you all my strategy,
would I?

91
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,760
All right, Jarrod. I'll have lunch with you.

92
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,825
<i>- Good!
- But on two conditions.</i>

93
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:09,034
- Name 'em.
- Well, we don't talk about my case. That's over.

94
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:13,408
Agreed. You served your sentence.
And I'm sure you wouldn't be foolish enough...

95
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,277
to go back into the shanghai racket,
would you?

96
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:20,752
I never admitted I was in
the shanghai business to begin with.

97
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,516
- Remember?
- I remember.

98
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,681
What's the second condition?

99
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,092
<i>- I want to pick the place.
- Anywhere you say.</i>

100
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:36,101
Well, how about... the Barkley Ranch?

101
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,429
<i>And you can inform your mother...</i>

102
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:44,966
<i>that I would like
a formal invitation in writing.</i>

103
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:49,913
Well, that is how it's done
in your part of town, isn't it?

104
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,973
Sometimes.

105
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,145
Good evening, Jarrod.

106
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,266
<i>Jarrod.</i>

107
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,015
Nick?

108
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,180
No sign of him anywhere in town.

109
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,852
Heath...

110
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:38,727
it's just a suspicion, but I-
I think Nick has been shanghaied.

111
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,323
- Shanghaied?
- Shh!

112
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,836
- Is Mother asleep?
- She's with Audra.

113
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:49,136
Barbary Red was a client of mine in San Francisco.

114
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,972
She used to work for a notorious crimp
named Jack Thatcher.

115
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,978
- "Crimp"?
- A crimp, Gene...

116
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,174
is a man who delivers live bodies
to ships that need crews.

117
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,377
- You think Nick and the men are already on a ship?
- I don't know.

118
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,422
All I know is that Nick isn't here
and the men aren't in the bunkhouse...

119
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:09,189
and Barbary Red once spent six months in jail
for enticing men to sea against their will.

120
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,388
There's a good chance she's
still in the same business.

121
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,694
But Stockton?
We're just a river port.

122
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:17,224
That doesn't make any difference.
They could be short of men.

123
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,294
<i>When that happens,
they'll sail with anything they can get.</i>

124
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:22,465
- And they never come back with the same crew.
- What do you mean?

125
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,510
<i>He means we may never see Nick again.</i>

126
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,908
There are only two ways
of escape from those ships.

127
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:37,683
<i>Desertion, which makes it
almost impossible to get back, or...</i>

128
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,459
death at sea.

129
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,197
Am I exaggerating, Jarrod?

130
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,324
No.

131
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,426
Why are we just standing here?
Let's go get the sheriff.

132
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,268
Oh, no, Audra.
I've seen this happen in San Francisco.

133
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,934
<i>I mean, if the sheriff goes to Barbary Red
and asks questions...</i>

134
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,467
<i>- she and her cohorts will get rid of the evidence.
- I don't understand.</i>

135
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,879
Nick, Hap and the others-
They're the only evidence against 'em.

136
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,749
- Well, if the law can't help-
- If Nick isn't back by morning...

137
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,288
we'll just have to help ourselves.

138
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,723
<i>You know the Sailor's Paradise Hotel.
It's on the waterfront.</i>

139
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,852
- I know the place.
- Well, they don't know you.

140
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,920
So I want you to check in there in the morning
and find out anything you can.

141
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,989
<i>Gene, you go to
the harbor master's office.</i>

142
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,967
<i>You get me a complete list
of all incoming and outgoing ships.</i>

143
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:28,496
It'll be my job to find out
whatever I can from Barbary Red.

144
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,475
I've invited her
here to lunch tomorrow.

145
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:35,742
<i>She'll come, but only if she gets
a written invitation from you.</i>

146
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,344
Jarrod, do we have enough time?

147
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:42,353
I'm not sure we have any time at all.

148
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,496
You all right?

149
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,561
Hap?

150
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,267
Where are we?

151
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:49,310
- By the river.
- Some birthday party.

152
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,352
Come on.

153
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,561
You all right?

154
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:18,541
<i>Belay that, mates.!</i>

155
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,552
You want to damage the goods?
This way.

156
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:48,903
Got a match, mate?

157
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:02,390
- Anything?
- Not yet.

158
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,452
Much obliged.

159
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,275
Did you really check
that last shipment of barrels?

160
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,338
You know, they're charging-

161
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,607
We'll check it later.

162
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:35,516
Good morning.

163
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,585
Uh-

164
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:44,463
I hope you like cold lobster
with a very dry white wine.

165
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:51,976
"The pleasure of your company"-
"Luncheon today, Victoria Barkley. "

166
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:56,481
And if the cook is in very good form,
a chocolate soufflé.

167
00:16:56,548 --> 00:17:00,780
- You're not joking, are you?
- Jarrod Barkley rarely jokes.

168
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:06,489
Come on now.
You think I'm a crimp.

169
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,924
I never called you a "crimp. "

170
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:12,930
I said, "think," and that is
what you think, isn't it?

171
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,228
That's what you thought
when you dropped my case.

172
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,896
Barbara, I dropped your case
because you wanted me to bribe a judge.

173
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:24,272
I said, I didn't want
to talk about that.

174
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:27,608
Look.
I run a waterfront bar.

175
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,513
That's not against the law,
is it, Counselor?

176
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,574
Absolutely not.

177
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,248
I'll pick you up at noon.

178
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,418
No.

179
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,483
I don't want to be "picked up. "

180
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,086
I hate that expression.

181
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,325
I'll ride out alone.

182
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,027
Alone?

183
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,570
I've got my passport, haven't I?

184
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,919
- Anything?
- There's three ships sailing at dawn.

185
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:20,692
All right. Now, you watch these two.
They're bound for the Orient.

186
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,725
I tell ya, we oughta start at one end
of that port and search every ship.

187
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:29,103
Gene, no captain is gonna let us aboard
a ship with crew of shanghaied sailors.

188
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:31,301
You're a lawyer.
Can't you get the sheriff or the judge...

189
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,367
to issue some kind of search warrant?

190
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,642
And take a chance that they'd dump Nick
into the river before we could get to him?

191
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:42,415
Jarrod, there's another way. Let me go down
to Barbary Red's and get myself shanghaied.

192
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:45,218
- No, Heath.
- But at least we'd know where Nick is.

193
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,485
The only think we'd know for sure
is that you'd both been shanghaied.

194
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:52,258
- You could follow me.
- These people are good at this. They've been at it a long time.

195
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,732
<i>You think they'rejust gonna drag you out
the front door and make a public announcement?</i>

196
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,565
<i>Believe me, we might lose both of you.</i>

197
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,765
Now, we may have to take that gamble,
but not yet.

198
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,742
Just give me a little more time.

199
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,954
Red, my love.

200
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,557
Jack, why didn't you let me know
you were in there?

201
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,832
I thought it'd be a pleasant surprise.

202
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:37,899
Well, since when do I have
to have an invitation to me own place?

203
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,476
Ohh!

204
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,989
You're a sweet-smellin' woman, Red.

205
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,929
I was out to the cold-storage house this morning.
There are only three fish on ice.

206
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:03,457
- It was a slow night. It was the best I could do.
- You're gonna have to try harder.

207
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,628
I've got three captains
waiting on crews.

208
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,332
You've got six other places
up and down the river.

209
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:12,935
- Are they delivering any better than me?
- No, but you're special, Red.

210
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:16,845
You always were,
ever since the first time I laid eyes on ya.

211
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,713
Hey, where are you goin'
dressed like that?

212
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,916
I've been invited to lunch
by a prominent local family.

213
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:32,763
"A prominent local family. "
What's his name?

214
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:36,597
<i>- And during lunch,
what are you going to talk about?</i>

215
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:41,134
<i>Let's see-
the price of a barrel of whiskey...</i>

216
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:46,041
or, um, the time I found you
hustlin' drinks in San Francisco.

217
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,848
Aw, Red.

218
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:56,047
Maybe old Jack's not the handsomest man
in the world, or the richest... yet.

219
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,783
But we haven't done too badly,
have we, love?

220
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,789
Oh, oh, I got somethin' for you.

221
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,533
This'll make you forget
that prominent local family.

222
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,739
What's he got that
old Jack can't give you?

223
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,147
Go ahead. Take it out.

224
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,748
Go on. Put it on.

225
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,897
Oh, Jack! Eh-

226
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:45,495
W-What's the matter?
Don't you like the color?

227
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,596
I-I- I could take it-

228
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,665
take it back.

229
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,241
I like the color.

230
00:21:55,314 --> 00:22:00,217
And I don't see how you can expect us to sit
and make polite conversation with that woman!

231
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:04,949
"That woman," Audra, knows where Nick is.
We don't.

232
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:11,525
Well, what do you talk about
with somebody like Barbary Red?

233
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:16,056
She's undoubtedly a lot more worried
about what she's going to say to you.

234
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,529
She's here.

235
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,830
<i>J'yah!</i>

236
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,708
Jarrod, she's driving away.

237
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,839
- Oh, go get her, Jarrod! Hurry!
- No, no.

238
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,619
No, it won't work here.
I can see that.

239
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,020
Then what are we going to do?

240
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:19,686
Well, if she won't
come into our world...

241
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,792
I've got to go back to hers.

242
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,409
Come in.

243
00:23:57,035 --> 00:24:01,995
I couldn't make it for lunch.
Something came up.

244
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:04,064
Liar.

245
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,385
You were afraid to come in the house,
weren't you?

246
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,855
Mm-hmm.

247
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:25,795
Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'll give you another chance.

248
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,855
Have dinner with me.

249
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,126
<i>Not at your house.</i>

250
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:36,834
Oh, no, no. We'll go out to
the best restaurant in Stockton.

251
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,746
You know, I want to prove
something to you-

252
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,475
about where you belong, Barbara.

253
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,898
I keep expecting to be
thrown out of here any minute-

254
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:07,132
have them send me back
to the saloon where I belong.

255
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,869
Barbara, nobody's gonna
throw you out of here.

256
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:15,936
You belong here...

257
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,005
if you want to.

258
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,883
Well, tonight, maybe, with you.

259
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:27,823
Just this once, for a laugh.

260
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:34,529
I know who I am.
I run a saloon.

261
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:39,127
It may not be much to you,
but I'm not doing so bad.

262
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,271
But it is bad.

263
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:46,208
As your friend, I can tell you,
it's worse than bad.

264
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,644
- You don't understand.
- Yes, I do.

265
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:52,911
Now, look, Barbara. I'm not the sheriff.
You don't have to pretend it's just a saloon.

266
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:56,385
- I've heard otherwise.
- All right.

267
00:25:56,454 --> 00:26:00,788
So a couple of cowboys get themselves
liquored up and they disappear.

268
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:05,091
So it's my fault?
Just like San Francisco?

269
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:07,154
Couple of cowboys disappeared?

270
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:12,169
<i>I'm saying if- if they disappear.</i>

271
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,797
Listen, the waterfront's a tough place.

272
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:20,004
Cowboys, sailors-
They get boozed up. I entertain them.

273
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,241
If they fall off the dock,
they better know how to swim.

274
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:30,451
Now tell me.
What do you want from me?

275
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:38,086
I want you to feel
that the next time...

276
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,825
you can step out of your carriage...

277
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,959
come into my house...

278
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:47,004
and be treated like
the beautiful woman you really are.

279
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,936
I have to go.

280
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:57,004
- Barbara-
- Now. Please.

281
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:05,889
Well, we had a beautiful dinner,
a lovely talk-

282
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:09,324
- And?
- Nothing.

283
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:12,158
You're still certain she's involved?

284
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,698
Yes, yes, I am.
Only-

285
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,757
Only what?

286
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,826
Oh, nothing.

287
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,463
She's a beautiful woman.

288
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,371
Isn't she.

289
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:32,075
And you wish you weren't
involved in this filthy mess, hmm?

290
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,348
Oh, I don't know.
All this lying to her, this pretending. I-

291
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:40,414
<i>I can't help but feel dirty about it.</i>

292
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:45,327
- They're moving some men to a ship.
- When?

293
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:49,094
Later. I don't know what ship or where,
but I know it'll be tonight.

294
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,261
Come on, come on. Anybody ever put up
a fight to get out of this place?

295
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,306
It won't do you no good, mates.

296
00:27:55,373 --> 00:28:00,174
I've been shanghaied twice now,
and I never heard of anybody breaking free.

297
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,406
The crimps knows their business...

298
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,641
or they wouldn't be in it so long.

299
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:07,276
<i>So you just give it all up, right?
Give it all up!</i>

300
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,962
Get over there!

301
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,165
I said, get down!

302
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,234
All right now.
Who's first?

303
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:36,439
<i>You'll be signin' aboard
the schooner Halcyon...</i>

304
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:38,641
bound for Pedian through Sunder Strait.

305
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,686
<i>A tropical voyage
to a South Sea paradise.</i>

306
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,313
And you expect us just to sign on, huh?

307
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:48,951
Oh, we can't put you aboard
without your signature...

308
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,120
or at least your mark.

309
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,130
Why, that would be illegal.

310
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,766
Sign the book.

311
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:02,963
Hey, hey.

312
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:36,440
Don't be a hero, lad.
Sign.

313
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:40,069
<i>The trip'll be educational,
and the work'll make a man of ya.</i>

314
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:42,136
Like them?

315
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:46,673
Well, they've learned their lessons well.
Like I say, the trip is educational.

316
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,618
Stand up.

317
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:02,322
Give him his first lesson.

318
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,238
Don't!

319
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:21,208
He's dead!

320
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:25,712
He's dead!

321
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,817
Stay there!

322
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:46,911
Well, are you ready
to sign now, cowboy?

323
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,047
Well, congratulations, lads.

324
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:30,451
You've signed on under the hardest man
that ever commanded a ship.

325
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:33,649
That'd be Bully Bob Waterman.

326
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:37,058
<i>You guessed it, lad.</i>

327
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:40,825
Well, bon voyage.

328
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,396
<i>Waterman.</i>

329
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,843
Waterman.

330
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,049
Would that be
Captain Robert Waterman?

331
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:10,652
The same.
No crueler captain on the seven seas.

332
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:12,821
Twelve lashes from a cat-o'-nine...

333
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:16,128
raises 108 welts on a bare back.

334
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,135
Bully Bob uses it every single day.

335
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,194
I've met the man...

336
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:25,041
at a party...

337
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,100
in my home.

338
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:31,509
You think he'd help us?

339
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:34,016
Well, we're not out to sea yet.

340
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,888
<i>Go away.</i>

341
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:50,860
- Jarrod.
- Barbara.

342
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:53,495
I've got something I want to say.

343
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:56,563
- Jarrod, you can't stay.
- It's been on my mind ever since dinner.

344
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,474
- It won't keep.
- Jarrod, I'm expecting someone.

345
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:02,104
Well, whoever it is,
he'll just have to wait.

346
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,115
I thought we said good night.

347
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,117
That's just the point, Barbara.

348
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:09,745
I want it to stay good night
and not good-bye.

349
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:13,018
You're gonna have to make a choice-
right now, tonight.

350
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:15,059
A choice?

351
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:19,085
A choice between this life here
or a life in my part of town.

352
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,599
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Listen to me.

353
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,227
I'm asking you to give it up-
all of it.

354
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:29,933
<i>And I'm not talking aboutjust this saloon-
I mean, the crimping.</i>

355
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,101
Let me go!

356
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,111
The shanghaiing, Barbara.
And don't bother to lie to me about it.

357
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:38,205
You practically admitted that three cowboys
were shanghaied out of this place last night.

358
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:41,809
- You're in it up to your neck!
- Jarrod, please, you've got to get out of here.

359
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:44,184
I told you, I was expecting someone.

360
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:48,715
Give it up, Barbara.
You're better than this- believe me, you are.

361
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,784
<i>Walk away.</i>

362
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:55,765
<i>If you don't, there'll never be
a chance for us- together.</i>

363
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,927
And I want that chance.

364
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,484
You can start tonight.

365
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,988
Let those men go now.

366
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,982
I can't do that.

367
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,051
Then tell me where they are.

368
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:33,296
Well, I don't believe
I've had the pleasure.

369
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:43,103
Jarrod Barkley.

370
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:46,241
Jack Thatcher.
You a friend of Red's?

371
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:52,081
The lady and I were just about to leave.
Weren't we, Barbara?

372
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,147
<i>Oh, were we, Barbara?</i>

373
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:56,216
Pete, Ben.

374
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,730
I think you'd better go, Jarrod.

375
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:09,699
Barbara, this is your last chance.
Make the right choice.

376
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:17,677
If you shanghai him,
Jack, we're through.

377
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,739
I mean it, Jack.

378
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,945
Dump him in the alley.

379
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,286
Here.

380
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,329
You're going back to San Francisco
with me tonight...

381
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:40,234
just as soon as I hand
Waterman his crew.

382
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,205
<i>- Jack, I want to quit.
- Quit, huh?</i>

383
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,675
For him, that fancy pants,
that Barkley?

384
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,110
You stupid-
What has he been tellin' ya?

385
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:52,172
And what kind of a fool
are you to believe him? He's-

386
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,582
Barkley.

387
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:00,120
Barkley.
That name is familiar.

388
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:03,183
Who is he, and what does he wa-

389
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:06,788
- Does he know about our operation here?
- No.

390
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:11,392
Are you sure? Tell me fast.
And if you're lyin' to me, I'm-

391
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:14,063
I'm just trying to make friends
in the right part of town.

392
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:17,665
That's what you want me to do, isn't it?
Butter up the right people?

393
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:21,610
Well, I pray that
you're not lyin' to me...

394
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,772
<i>Barbara.</i>

395
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:38,884
Jarrod, you went about this all wrong.
You should have come to me in the first place.

396
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:41,796
Steve, while we're standing here talking,
Nick may be shipped to heaven knows where.

397
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:45,063
- That's what I mean. If you'd come to me sooner-
- My son's life is at stake.

398
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:48,128
We did what we thought was best,
and we'll do it the same way again.

399
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,004
Steve, you're just wasting time.

400
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,536
Now, do you still want
to go through with it?

401
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:59,708
<i>- Steve, for the love of-
- All right.</i>

402
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:03,015
<i>I said the plan has a chance of working.
Now I've got to tell you-</i>

403
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:08,184
I also think Heath has a chance
of winding up dead if it doesn't.

404
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,250
I'll take that chance.

405
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:15,632
I'll round up some deputies.

406
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,808
This'll give you a little head start.

407
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,629
Bartender, gimme a drink.

408
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:59,733
I'm a seagoin' wolf,
and it's my night to howl.

409
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,301
No, no, no.
Whiskey, whiskey.

410
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:11,211
To the brim.
Come on. Fill it up.

411
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,214
Much obliged.

412
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:19,227
Just leave the bottle here.

413
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:29,937
We have a likely fish downstairs.

414
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:31,998
Shall we hook him?

415
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:36,945
Waterman'll take all we bring. He needs a full crew.

416
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,989
What'll it be?

417
00:38:56,067 --> 00:39:01,369
- Well, anything, as long as it ain't water.
- Oh, it won't be water.

418
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:20,212
Hey, pretty lady.
Let's dance a little jig here, huh?

419
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,369
Get out of here, mate, now.

420
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:46,507
- Come on, honey bee.
- Now, while you-

421
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,414
All right.
If you don't wanna dance...

422
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,479
- let's have a drink.
- Have a drink.

423
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,820
<i>Yeah.</i>

424
00:39:54,892 --> 00:40:00,387
What's- Ooh, buddy, buddy!

425
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,328
Come on, mate.
Get ahold of yourself.

426
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:09,533
Oh, you are the prettiest thing
I have ever seen.

427
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:18,342
Well, why don't you have a drink?

428
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:24,878
Ooh.
Is there a place on this train...

429
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:28,220
where a fella might... lay down?

430
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:35,864
<i>Ahh, this way to the sleepin'car, mate.</i>

431
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,448
All right.
Let's go, Red.

432
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:06,891
I want you where I can
keep an eye on you.

433
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:45,525
All right, you men.
Up on your feet.

434
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:48,629
Captain Waterman wants
to look over his new crew.

435
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:52,335
It's him, Bully Bob.
If you know him, now's your chance.

436
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,275
Good evening, men.
I hope you're all well.

437
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,546
Captain Waterman, I'm Nick Barkley.

438
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:14,257
Let this man out. I want to talk to him.

439
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:38,477
- This is most unfortunate, Barkley.
- Straighten it out, Captain.

440
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,354
- Oh, I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.
- Nothing?

441
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:45,156
My men and I were shanghaied.
One of them was killed.

442
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,220
Ship's articles.

443
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:59,239
"Nick Barkley. "
Is that your signature?

444
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:02,404
We were forced to sign.
One man was beaten to death because he didn't.

445
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:08,008
Now, that's not true, Captain.
They all signed of their own free will.

446
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:13,216
<i>- Was someone beaten?
- No. A man deserted, but I don't think we'll ever see him again.</i>

447
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:16,418
He wouldn't want to face a court-martial
for desertion, would he, Captain?

448
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:19,792
Barkley, you're under my command.

449
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:23,765
Your very life for the next two years
is in my hands.

450
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:28,794
From now on, you will not speak to me without
my prior permission. Is that understood?

451
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:31,705
Lock him up.
We sail at dawn.

452
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:51,180
The money's all there, I assure you.
I'm an honest man.

453
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:55,385
We're all honest, Captain,
and we stay honest by not trustin' anybody.

454
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:57,450
<i>Count that.</i>

455
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:08,734
Hey! Now, just where do
you think you're going?

456
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,570
Back to town.
I'm finished with this business!

457
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:13,803
Oh, you're finished, are ya?

458
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:18,041
Well, then I should have taken care
of your boyfriend after all, huh?

459
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,583
And I thought
I'd smartened you up some.

460
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:24,018
<i>You didn't really think
I'd let you go, did ya?</i>

461
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:27,888
And if you ran, you must've known
I'd come after you, didn't ya?

462
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:43,229
Keep a close eye on her
and make sure she doesn't go anywhere.

463
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,372
<i>Is it all there?</i>

464
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:52,609
<i>All right. Let's get them out
and get 'em in the wagon.</i>

465
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:58,784
All right.
Line up against the wall.

466
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:03,356
We're goin' for a little ride.

467
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,960
Uh, pick him up.

468
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:22,643
Hold it! Now you call out there...

469
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:26,444
and you tell him to open that door,
or I'm gonna blow your head off.

470
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:31,509
Tell 'im!
Or I'll blow you apart.

471
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,056
Open up! We're comin' out!

472
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,590
You haven't got a chance!

473
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:12,691
Red! Run it back here!

474
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:22,730
- You tricked me! How could you do that to me?
- My brother's in there!

475
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:25,036
Oh, everything you said-
You're a liar!

476
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,606
Hyah!

477
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:39,579
Jack!

478
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:57,163
You used me.

479
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:02,811
All my life men have used me.

480
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:41,109
- Get 'em all. One more.
- Ah! One here.

481
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:45,382
Well, I hope you got another cake around,
because I plan to eat all this by myself.

482
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:49,482
- Oh, no, you don't. We all get our share.
- I'll have a big piece...

483
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:51,789
- with that big flower on it.
- All right.

484
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,887
<i>- I get the flower.
- Here we go.</i>

485
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:56,489
<i>- All right.
- That big enough for ya?</i>

486
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,898
<i>- Fancy. We used to-
- How's that?</i>

487
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:02,200
<i>- Come on. Put it in, put it in.
- Wow, look at that.</i>

488
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:06,472
- Mine.
- Ah.

489
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:12,874
You going to town?

490
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,010
Well, I- I thought
I might drop by the jail.

491
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:18,077
Well, you think she'll see you?

492
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:21,215
I don't know,
but she's gonna need a good lawyer.

493
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:25,288
Well, she'll have the best there is.
