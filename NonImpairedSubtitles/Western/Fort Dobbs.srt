1
00:01:30,765 --> 00:01:32,265
Looking for somebody?

2
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:35,001
Yeah.

3
00:01:35,602 --> 00:01:36,607
Johanson?

4
00:01:37,308 --> 00:01:38,385
Where is he?

5
00:01:38,686 --> 00:01:39,660
Why?

6
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:44,156
I'm gonna kill him.

7
00:01:44,157 --> 00:01:45,743
Not in Largo.

8
00:01:46,844 --> 00:01:48,705
Keeping the law in this town is my job

9
00:01:48,706 --> 00:01:50,720
and I intend to do it, 
no matter what.

10
00:01:53,483 --> 00:01:54,983
I remember that.

11
00:01:55,484 --> 00:01:56,935
You better had,

12
00:01:57,336 --> 00:01:59,535
I'd hate to have to hang you.

13
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,920
See that sheriff?

14
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:12,834
Now I see it.

15
00:05:15,035 --> 00:05:15,965
There's trouble.

16
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,593
The Comanches with war paint will 
tore this territory wide open.

17
00:05:19,594 --> 00:05:20,985
Without splitting...

18
00:05:21,486 --> 00:05:22,323
So?

19
00:05:22,324 --> 00:05:24,460
Well, how long are we 
gonna keep after him?

20
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:25,756
Till we get him.

21
00:05:26,457 --> 00:05:27,995
Or they do.

22
00:08:44,996 --> 00:08:45,863
Sheriff...

23
00:08:54,164 --> 00:08:55,671
It's like they did this to him.

24
00:08:55,772 --> 00:08:57,277
I'm glad they did.

25
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,182
Come on, let's get out of here.

26
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:42,916
Mama...

27
00:12:43,517 --> 00:12:44,795
Mama...

28
00:13:45,796 --> 00:13:46,695
Mama...

29
00:13:48,296 --> 00:13:49,109
Ma...

30
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,657
Are you all right?

31
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:07,741
I think so.

32
00:14:08,942 --> 00:14:10,419
I'm Mrs. Grey

33
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,843
This here is my son, Chad.

34
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:15,520
I shot you.

35
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:20,893
He says he caught trying to 
take one of our a horses.

36
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:30,647
Well?

37
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,178
The boy is right.

38
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:35,664
You see, you see I told you.

39
00:14:36,365 --> 00:14:37,974
- The horses...
- Chad.

40
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:40,533
I lost my horse someways back.

41
00:14:41,334 --> 00:14:43,386
A man on foot is not worth much 
in this country.

42
00:14:43,687 --> 00:14:46,734
You could have asked for
the loan of a horse.

43
00:14:47,435 --> 00:14:50,406
Yes ma'am, it seems 
I made a mistake.

44
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:52,789
If you ask me, I think
we ought to hang him,

45
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,296
Just wait until dad comes back,
he'll know what to do.

46
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:59,048
That'll be enough Chad, now put the 
gun down, and go grain the animals.

47
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:01,157
- But ma...
- Do like I say.

48
00:15:02,058 --> 00:15:03,051
Yes, ma.

49
00:15:04,352 --> 00:15:05,855
Where is your husband?

50
00:15:05,856 --> 00:15:08,433
In Largo, he'll be back today.

51
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,167
He won't be here.

52
00:15:11,392 --> 00:15:12,835
What do you mean?

53
00:15:13,036 --> 00:15:15,108
The hills are crawling with Comanches.

54
00:15:15,109 --> 00:15:16,878
The most likely he has been cut off

55
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,531
and he's forted up somewhere.

56
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:21,450
But he wouldn't leave us 
out here alone.

57
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:23,609
Not if he had a choice.

58
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,534
Mind if I take my gun?

59
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:29,932
Go right ahead.

60
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:36,154
If I were you, Ms. Grey, I would get 
out of here while you still got time.

61
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:38,997
A few days will put you in Fort Dobbs.

62
00:15:38,998 --> 00:15:40,510
You'll be safe there.

63
00:15:42,111 --> 00:15:43,585
I can't do that.

64
00:15:44,786 --> 00:15:46,842
It's the only thing you can do.

65
00:15:48,843 --> 00:15:50,381
Look mister...

66
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,278
Davis.

67
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,572
Gar Davis.

68
00:15:53,573 --> 00:15:57,789
Mr. Davis, I know this ranch 
don't look like much,

69
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,837
but it is all we have.

70
00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:02,625
What about the boy?

71
00:16:03,226 --> 00:16:05,830
Kind of young to die for
a broken down house 

72
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,497
and a plain barn, isn't he?

73
00:16:08,998 --> 00:16:10,490
I'd think you would understand.

74
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:14,133
I understand Indians,

75
00:16:14,134 --> 00:16:16,393
it will be over quick
with the youngster.

76
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:19,227
But you're a handsome woman, Mrs. Grey,

77
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:23,358
- they'd take you alive.
- I don't scare easy, Mr. Davis.

78
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:28,108
I hope not.

79
00:16:28,109 --> 00:16:31,315
'Cause there's a Comanches war party 
over the corral watching every

80
00:16:31,316 --> 00:16:32,432
move we make.

81
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:46,088
Start walking at the house 
like nothing was wrong.

82
00:16:47,436 --> 00:16:48,906
Do like I tell you.

83
00:17:03,507 --> 00:17:04,799
Look, ma.

84
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,348
That did it.

85
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:43,656
Easy on these shells,
They'll be here for a while.

86
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:45,792
What are you gonna do?

87
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:48,931
I think the only thing we can do

88
00:18:48,932 --> 00:18:50,482
is try to hold out until dark.

89
00:18:50,983 --> 00:18:53,476
If we can keep them until then, 
we've got a chance.

90
00:18:53,477 --> 00:18:57,960
If we can get a hand on those horses 
before they, we make a break for it.

91
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,922
I'm scared, Mr. Davis.

92
00:19:06,471 --> 00:19:08,637
Yes ma'am, so am I.

93
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:34,983
You'll sit there until the morning 
feeling sorry for yourself, Mrs. Grey?

94
00:24:34,984 --> 00:24:36,491
The Comanches will like that.

95
00:24:39,192 --> 00:24:41,709
Haven't you ever lost anything, Mr. Davis?

96
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,424
Yes, ma'am.

97
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,480
But I learned not to look back.

98
00:25:14,381 --> 00:25:15,877
Is something wrong?

99
00:25:18,378 --> 00:25:20,447
We could get caught in 
that open, that will be.

100
00:25:20,448 --> 00:25:22,394
You and the boy wait here.

101
00:26:05,095 --> 00:26:05,851
Comanches!

102
00:26:05,852 --> 00:26:07,222
It looks like the whole nation.

103
00:26:08,623 --> 00:26:10,622
Let's circle them high around.

104
00:26:11,323 --> 00:26:12,729
No, Mr. Davis.

105
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,354
We're going back.

106
00:26:14,755 --> 00:26:15,598
Back?

107
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,931
We're only two days out of Largo,

108
00:26:18,132 --> 00:26:20,631
you can take us there 
as well as to Dobbs.

109
00:26:21,232 --> 00:26:22,748
I can't do that.

110
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:25,006
You mean you won't.

111
00:26:26,006 --> 00:26:27,430
I mean I can't.

112
00:26:29,531 --> 00:26:31,971
- My husband is...
- Come to Fort Dobbs, Ms. Grey.

113
00:27:22,072 --> 00:27:25,096
I take the boy on the cross 
and then come back after you.

114
00:27:25,097 --> 00:27:27,787
I can get across without your help.

115
00:27:29,255 --> 00:27:32,980
Maybe you can, maybe you can't.
But you wait here like I told you.

116
00:27:52,981 --> 00:27:55,098
Hold, I told you to wait.

117
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,311
Feeling better?

118
00:31:05,712 --> 00:31:06,712
Yes.

119
00:31:08,528 --> 00:31:11,276
I... I'm sorry, Mr. Davis.

120
00:31:11,277 --> 00:31:13,558
I acted like a fool.

121
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,044
Yes, ma'am, you did.

122
00:31:17,045 --> 00:31:18,836
After all you've done 
for Chad and me,

123
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:20,851
I never even thanked you

124
00:31:22,752 --> 00:31:24,323
We're not at Dobbs yet.

125
00:31:28,524 --> 00:31:31,587
- Mr. Davis...
- Yes, ma'am.

126
00:31:33,088 --> 00:31:35,523
Why wouldn't you take us back to Largo?

127
00:31:38,824 --> 00:31:40,121
If troubles go on,

128
00:31:40,122 --> 00:31:41,979
your husband can pick you 
up at the fort.

129
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,117
I'm not talking about my husband, 
I'm talking about you.

130
00:31:47,818 --> 00:31:49,991
You are running away from 
something, aren't you?

131
00:31:50,292 --> 00:31:52,804
You were running away 
that night back at the ranch

132
00:31:52,805 --> 00:31:54,793
when you tried to take 
away one of our horses.

133
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:56,292
Why?

134
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:01,294
I'm obliged for your
concern, Mrs. Grey.

135
00:32:03,795 --> 00:32:06,221
But it's none of my business, huh?

136
00:32:07,522 --> 00:32:09,770
Some things are better left alone.

137
00:32:12,271 --> 00:32:13,281
I see.

138
00:32:14,382 --> 00:32:16,425
No, ma'am, you don't.

139
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:16,789
My husband,
you killed him.

140
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,303
What are you talking about?

141
00:33:18,504 --> 00:33:19,799
This!

142
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,121
I took this of a dead man.

143
00:33:24,122 --> 00:33:25,812
After you shot him in the back.

144
00:33:26,913 --> 00:33:29,357
That's you knew why 
he wasn't coming home.

145
00:33:29,358 --> 00:33:31,398
That's why you wouldn't 
take us to Largo.

146
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:33,096
And that's why running away.

147
00:33:33,497 --> 00:33:34,552
Gimme that!

148
00:33:36,253 --> 00:33:37,275
Now listen to me!

149
00:33:37,276 --> 00:33:38,229
Listen to me!

150
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,877
I had a posse on my tail,

151
00:33:39,878 --> 00:33:41,058
they were even to hang me.

152
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:43,397
I traded coats with a dead man
who that was thrown off.

153
00:33:43,798 --> 00:33:45,280
If it was your husband,
I am sorry.

154
00:33:45,281 --> 00:33:47,151
But it was the only way I had.

155
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:49,641
You're lying, you killed him. 
You killed.

156
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:04,313
Mr. Davis.

157
00:35:04,714 --> 00:35:06,739
It's all right, I see him.

158
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,692
Who you know, Gar Davis.

159
00:35:17,693 --> 00:35:20,863
Hello Clett, you're lost?

160
00:35:20,864 --> 00:35:24,215
You ought to know me better than that,
I always know where I'm going.

161
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:28,151
Boy, you got yourself on some 
lonesome ground, aren't you?

162
00:35:30,252 --> 00:35:31,816
I like that though.

163
00:35:32,117 --> 00:35:34,130
It quiets me down.

164
00:35:34,731 --> 00:35:36,231
You're still killing, Clett?

165
00:35:36,732 --> 00:35:38,151
I'm alive.

166
00:35:38,552 --> 00:35:39,627
Are you?

167
00:35:40,028 --> 00:35:41,520
Much as you are.

168
00:35:41,521 --> 00:35:45,334
I've come though Largo when that 
sheriff there bought a new horse.

169
00:35:46,035 --> 00:35:48,082
He said he left him in some canyon

170
00:35:48,183 --> 00:35:49,657
With a hole in his back.

171
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:51,468
That he said.

172
00:35:51,969 --> 00:35:53,423
When I heard that
it kind of touched me.

173
00:35:54,024 --> 00:35:56,048
And went to the saloon and
got me some drinks over it.

174
00:35:56,049 --> 00:35:58,046
Grieving or celebrating?

175
00:35:58,947 --> 00:35:59,944
Both.

176
00:36:01,045 --> 00:36:02,514
That's yours?

177
00:36:08,815 --> 00:36:10,880
The Comanches overrun her ranch

178
00:36:10,881 --> 00:36:12,768
I'm taking her and the boy to Dobbs.

179
00:36:13,769 --> 00:36:15,830
You are taking a long
way around, ain't you?

180
00:36:16,531 --> 00:36:18,144
Not that I blame you,

181
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:21,708
she's a fine looking woman.

182
00:36:24,009 --> 00:36:26,071
You are doing all right
for a dead man, ain't you?

183
00:36:29,306 --> 00:36:30,701
Good morning, ma'am.

184
00:36:31,902 --> 00:36:32,992
Good morning.

185
00:36:33,993 --> 00:36:36,613
From what I understand, you are 
going to Fort Dobbs.

186
00:36:38,114 --> 00:36:40,447
I'm heading that way myself, and...

187
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:44,057
I'd be real happy if I
ride along with your ways.

188
00:36:44,637 --> 00:36:47,108
I'm getting real tired 
talking to them mules.

189
00:36:47,709 --> 00:36:50,072
...You're a friend of Mr. Davis?

190
00:36:52,073 --> 00:36:53,606
No, he is not.

191
00:36:54,407 --> 00:36:55,864
Let's back that.

192
00:36:55,865 --> 00:36:58,425
I think you best be
moving along, Clett.

193
00:36:58,426 --> 00:37:00,193
I'm talking to the lady.

194
00:37:00,194 --> 00:37:01,702
And I'm talking to you.

195
00:37:01,703 --> 00:37:04,430
Anything you got to do, 
do it elsewhere.

196
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,678
We're all heading for the same place.

197
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:08,884
I don't see no harm in
sticking together.

198
00:37:10,885 --> 00:37:12,929
An extra gun might come in handy.

199
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,168
Not your gun.

200
00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:19,350
Maybe you don't want us 
to get to Fort Dobbs?

201
00:37:19,851 --> 00:37:23,292
Could it be you're afraid they might 
find out what happened in Largo?

202
00:37:46,293 --> 00:37:47,893
She know, right?

203
00:37:49,453 --> 00:37:50,932
She thinks she does.

204
00:37:51,533 --> 00:37:54,632
If she tells them soldiers at 
the Fort you ain't dead...

205
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:57,332
It might go kind of 
tough on you, huh?

206
00:37:57,933 --> 00:38:01,026
I set out to take them to Dobbs and 
that's what I full intend to do.

207
00:38:02,327 --> 00:38:03,785
You're a nick.

208
00:38:03,786 --> 00:38:05,946
You're sure you don't want 
me going with you?

209
00:38:06,547 --> 00:38:07,732
Real sure.

210
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:09,502
It suit yourself.

211
00:38:09,903 --> 00:38:12,365
Like I said, we're all 
going to the same place.

212
00:38:14,266 --> 00:38:15,736
I'll be seeing you, Gar.

213
00:38:16,037 --> 00:38:17,547
Come on, Joby.

214
00:38:19,848 --> 00:38:21,733
Very pleased to have met you, ma'am.

215
00:38:36,234 --> 00:38:40,246
If you got any ideas of using that rifle, 
Ms. Grey, you better forget them.

216
00:38:41,247 --> 00:38:44,029
Kill me and you and the boy 
will never get to Dobbs.

217
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,516
- Mr. Davis! 
- Yeah?

218
00:38:58,617 --> 00:39:01,460
I'm sorry I shot you and 
called you a horse thief.

219
00:39:01,461 --> 00:39:02,858
That's all right.

220
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:04,832
No, I mean...

221
00:39:05,733 --> 00:39:09,242
My dad says a man should never
say words against anybody,

222
00:39:09,843 --> 00:39:11,960
unless he knows all the facts.

223
00:39:16,361 --> 00:39:19,705
He says that sometimes 
things look one way

224
00:39:19,706 --> 00:39:22,217
and turn out to be all 
together something else.

225
00:39:23,418 --> 00:39:25,896
If he'd caught you
stealing that horse...

226
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,195
Why are we stopping?

227
00:39:28,796 --> 00:39:29,944
Your mother.

228
00:39:29,945 --> 00:39:31,595
She's falling behind.

229
00:39:35,296 --> 00:39:38,223
She walks good, but she 
ain't much on a horse.

230
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:41,764
How much longer we got to go, Mr. Davis?

231
00:39:41,765 --> 00:39:45,171
Oh, we ought to be in Dobbs
some time tomorrow.

232
00:39:45,172 --> 00:39:47,495
My dad, he's gonna meet 
us there, ain't he?

233
00:39:49,496 --> 00:39:50,551
Ain't he?

234
00:39:50,852 --> 00:39:52,324
That depends.

235
00:39:53,325 --> 00:39:54,598
No, it don't.

236
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:56,122
He will get through.

237
00:39:56,123 --> 00:39:58,433
It takes more than a few 
Indians to stop my dad.

238
00:39:58,434 --> 00:39:59,676
You wait and see.

239
00:40:03,377 --> 00:40:04,141
Chad!

240
00:40:04,642 --> 00:40:05,698
Yes, sir.

241
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:17,266
A while back before I ran into 
you and your mother, I...

242
00:40:17,567 --> 00:40:19,504
...found a man.

243
00:40:19,505 --> 00:40:22,387
He had been ambushed and 
had an arrow in his back.

244
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:28,065
Yes, sir?

245
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,157
You go riding up over that 
ridge without looking first

246
00:40:32,158 --> 00:40:33,970
the same thing could happen to you.

247
00:40:33,971 --> 00:40:35,661
Now, go back and ride
with your mother.

248
00:40:35,662 --> 00:40:37,683
- But...
- Just do like I tell you.

249
00:41:52,884 --> 00:41:54,332
What is it?

250
00:41:55,233 --> 00:41:57,271
Stay alert on your horses.

251
00:42:00,022 --> 00:42:02,519
If I make it across the flats 
to those rocks,

252
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,193
you and the boy come across.

253
00:42:04,194 --> 00:42:07,724
And if I don't...
You see that long peek,

254
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,491
ride for it and don't stop 
until you come to the river.

255
00:42:10,492 --> 00:42:14,283
It'll take you a couple of days out of 
the way, but runs on down to Dobbs.

256
00:42:15,184 --> 00:42:17,898
You're thinking to leave us, Mr. Davis?

257
00:42:21,399 --> 00:42:23,007
I've thought about it.

258
00:42:23,793 --> 00:42:24,827
But I can't.

259
00:42:25,093 --> 00:42:28,595
I keep thinking how you'd be looking
after the Comanches get through with you.

260
00:46:42,596 --> 00:46:44,569
I told you an extra gun
might come in handy.

261
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:07,153
- I' told you to ride for the river.
- I only thought I...

262
00:47:07,188 --> 00:47:09,734
I'd appreciate if you don't 
think at all, Ms. Grey.

263
00:47:10,535 --> 00:47:12,547
It won't happen again.

264
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:15,692
Well, I'd like a good argument 
as much as the next fellow, but

265
00:47:15,693 --> 00:47:17,178
I think we ought to get up 
to this higher ground

266
00:47:17,179 --> 00:47:19,558
in case of them Comanches 
is gonna try again, huh?

267
00:47:20,959 --> 00:47:22,176
Hey, son...

268
00:47:22,677 --> 00:47:25,265
Let's go catch Mr. Davis's 
horse for him.

269
00:47:25,266 --> 00:47:26,177
Yes, sir.

270
00:48:19,978 --> 00:48:22,204
Here you are, ma, I'm 
gonna go help Mr. Davis.

271
00:48:22,205 --> 00:48:23,319
All right, son.

272
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,292
You have a good little boy, Mrs. Grey.

273
00:48:28,693 --> 00:48:29,507
Yes.

274
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:33,508
You sure make good coffee, ma'am.

275
00:48:34,209 --> 00:48:35,059
Thank you.

276
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,530
You know I always did say if I had 
to take up with a woman she's...

277
00:48:38,531 --> 00:48:41,019
got to be good cook first, and 
then be good looking second.

278
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,213
But I never did have 
much good luck with women.

279
00:48:45,314 --> 00:48:49,863
Well, I ran with a few of them
now and then, but nothing serious.

280
00:48:52,064 --> 00:48:54,139
Up until that time down in Bigsby,

281
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,028
about a half year ago.

282
00:48:58,567 --> 00:49:00,985
There was a girl who claimed 
right out she wanted to marry me,

283
00:49:01,799 --> 00:49:03,284
and told everybody.

284
00:49:03,985 --> 00:49:05,474
Everybody except her husband.

285
00:49:10,475 --> 00:49:13,498
Well, it came about that close or he'd 
hit me in the back with a shotgun.

286
00:49:14,499 --> 00:49:16,948
It makes me shiver, 
every time I think about it.

287
00:49:18,049 --> 00:49:19,579
It taught me once lesson, though.

288
00:49:20,414 --> 00:49:22,497
You always check the brand first,

289
00:49:25,498 --> 00:49:28,889
That way you'll know if you run 
somebody's else's stock, you see?

290
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:33,679
- Would you like a little more coffee?
- Yes, ma'am.

291
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,991
How long have you known Mr. Davis?

292
00:49:37,992 --> 00:49:39,969
Oh, a long time.

293
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:43,618
You know Mrs. Grey, it might 
sound kind of silly to you,

294
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:47,590
but I've been thinking and I've 
made up my mind about something.

295
00:49:50,891 --> 00:49:54,166
I'm gonna keep looking for a woman 
and she's gonna be just like you.

296
00:49:55,467 --> 00:49:56,974
Same color hair,

297
00:49:58,623 --> 00:50:00,132
same kind of eyes,

298
00:50:02,133 --> 00:50:05,142
all, all the same thing all.

299
00:50:06,443 --> 00:50:08,406
But I ought to have look pretty far

300
00:50:08,407 --> 00:50:10,339
to find one near as handsome.

301
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:16,864
Oh, it troubles me alright, but when 
I get my heart set on something...

302
00:50:17,365 --> 00:50:19,287
Say, like a good bredded horse,

303
00:50:20,888 --> 00:50:24,424
I just know that I don't live with 
myself if I don't get my hands on it.

304
00:50:26,025 --> 00:50:28,069
It is not only what pleases me,

305
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:31,038
you know what I mean Mrs. Grey?

306
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:35,135
You're gonna talk all day, Clett?

307
00:50:35,136 --> 00:50:36,883
Somebody ought to be standing guard.

308
00:50:36,884 --> 00:50:37,865
You are right.

309
00:50:38,866 --> 00:50:40,401
Who is? You start, huh?

310
00:50:45,202 --> 00:50:47,235
You've never seen one of 
them before, have you?

311
00:50:47,636 --> 00:50:49,305
It's a new Henry.

312
00:50:53,206 --> 00:50:55,171
15 shells and one in the chamber.

313
00:50:55,972 --> 00:50:58,013
Brass framing, ready to fire,

314
00:50:58,014 --> 00:50:59,882
"Gordon Sonny" and shoot always.

315
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:03,049
And the mules are carrying 
100 more just like this.

316
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:05,650
I figure I'd sell them in Santa Fe

317
00:51:05,651 --> 00:51:08,241
over to the Comanches, up there
they will bring up a piece of money.

318
00:51:08,442 --> 00:51:09,939
If I get through.

319
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,420
- And if you don't?
- Well, I'll make it.

320
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,687
One way or the other, huh?

321
00:51:15,688 --> 00:51:16,896
You're meaning what?

322
00:51:16,897 --> 00:51:19,279
The Comanches pay gold for 
the rifles, don't they?

323
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,671
You think I do things like that?

324
00:51:21,672 --> 00:51:23,335
I know you would.

325
00:51:35,036 --> 00:51:37,568
Yes, sometimes I don't like him.

326
00:51:37,569 --> 00:51:39,049
I hate him.

327
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:41,853
You do?

328
00:51:42,654 --> 00:51:44,173
He killed my husband.

329
00:52:54,174 --> 00:52:55,154
Mrs. Grey?

330
00:52:58,055 --> 00:52:59,490
I couldn't sleep.

331
00:52:59,791 --> 00:53:01,212
That's is good, I'm glad.

332
00:53:04,013 --> 00:53:06,054
You know, it makes 
some lonesome night.

333
00:53:07,655 --> 00:53:09,106
It's a shame, isn't it?

334
00:53:09,407 --> 00:53:11,976
This country isn't safe 
when it is dark.

335
00:53:16,377 --> 00:53:17,317
Mrs. Grey?

336
00:53:17,518 --> 00:53:18,329
Huh?

337
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:22,011
Your husband, how come
he stood up to Gar?

338
00:53:24,012 --> 00:53:26,815
He didn't.
He shot him in the back.

339
00:53:27,816 --> 00:53:30,895
This man got to have a pretty good 
reason to shoot him in the back.

340
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:35,017
You were that reason, Mrs. Grey?

341
00:53:37,418 --> 00:53:38,167
No.

342
00:53:38,668 --> 00:53:39,882
You are traveling with him.

343
00:53:41,883 --> 00:53:43,440
I had no choice.

344
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,134
You have now.

345
00:53:51,176 --> 00:53:53,215
We could be in Dobbs this morning.

346
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:58,398
You mean you take us there?

347
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:03,194
That depends, ma'am.

348
00:54:05,695 --> 00:54:08,855
A man can do an awful lot 
of things for a woman like you.

349
00:54:15,456 --> 00:54:16,915
What are you doing?

350
00:54:23,316 --> 00:54:25,845
Gar has already done 
one man in the back.

351
00:54:26,246 --> 00:54:29,053
You don't think I'm gonna take a chance 
something like that happen to me,

352
00:54:29,054 --> 00:54:30,877
unless you're willing to give 
me something in return, do you?

353
00:54:34,778 --> 00:54:36,242
Turn her loose, Clett.

354
00:54:41,943 --> 00:54:44,769
It might be better all around
if you just pack up and move on.

355
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:46,087
Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

356
00:54:49,788 --> 00:54:52,273
That way you would have her
all yourself every night.

357
00:54:52,674 --> 00:54:54,757
Is that why you killed her husband?

358
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:00,337
Get up.

359
00:55:05,338 --> 00:55:07,419
I ain't gonna quarrel you, Gar...

360
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:16,996
Not at all. You can have her.

361
00:55:26,697 --> 00:55:29,262
He said he was gonna 
take us to Fort Dobbs.

362
00:55:31,663 --> 00:55:34,722
I got to make sure that 
Chad and I get there.

363
00:55:35,323 --> 00:55:37,355
You can't wait to 
turn me in, can you?

364
00:55:37,656 --> 00:55:40,695
Why didn't you have Clett
shoot me in the back?

365
00:55:42,196 --> 00:55:44,219
Like you shot my husband, huh?

366
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,676
I left a man dead man 
in Largo, Mrs. Grey...

367
00:55:54,377 --> 00:55:56,250
But I didn't kill your husband.

368
00:56:03,051 --> 00:56:04,130
Hey, Gar!

369
00:56:05,131 --> 00:56:06,600
There's gonna be a next time.

370
00:56:31,201 --> 00:56:32,103
Chad!

371
00:56:37,604 --> 00:56:38,500
Chad.

372
00:56:47,301 --> 00:56:48,102
Chad!

373
00:56:53,703 --> 00:56:54,566
Chad...

374
00:56:54,967 --> 00:56:57,023
He can't be far, he's on foot.

375
00:56:59,824 --> 00:57:01,893
He must have heard us last night.

376
00:57:02,394 --> 00:57:03,444
Yes, ma'am.

377
00:57:07,345 --> 00:57:08,845
What are you gonna do?

378
00:57:09,446 --> 00:57:13,841
He's been lying to, Mrs Grey, but
finally I'm gonna tell him the truth.

379
00:57:14,592 --> 00:57:18,069
How do you tell a boy 
you killed his father?

380
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:24,887
How do you tell a woman 
you didn't?

381
00:58:36,488 --> 00:58:37,316
Chad?

382
00:58:39,317 --> 00:58:41,339
Just let me be.

383
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:51,030
- Listen to me there's something I didn't...
- My dad is dead. You killed him!

384
00:58:51,931 --> 00:58:53,417
You're wrong, Chad.

385
00:58:53,418 --> 00:58:54,955
Wrong was I was not 
telling you the truth.

386
00:58:54,956 --> 00:58:56,242
Go away.

387
00:58:56,243 --> 00:58:57,733
Not until you know how it was.

388
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:01,428
The man I was telling you about, 
the one that the Comanches ambushed,

389
00:59:01,429 --> 00:59:02,994
was your father.

390
00:59:04,395 --> 00:59:06,415
My dad could take care of himself.

391
00:59:06,416 --> 00:59:08,265
He could have got through.

392
00:59:08,266 --> 00:59:09,429
He died trying.

393
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:10,739
You killed him.

394
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:12,202
He was dead when I found him.

395
00:59:12,237 --> 00:59:15,442
Dead because he didn't want to 
leave you and your mother alone.

396
00:59:16,243 --> 00:59:17,286
You're lying.

397
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:21,853
I heard what my ma said. 
You shot him.

398
00:59:22,954 --> 00:59:23,879
Why?

399
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,880
I didn't kill your father, Chad.
I am telling you the truth, boy.

400
00:59:26,881 --> 00:59:28,734
I don't believe you.

401
00:59:33,535 --> 00:59:35,551
All right, have it your way.

402
00:59:35,552 --> 00:59:38,450
But that's no reason to run off and 
leave your mother like you did.

403
00:59:39,551 --> 00:59:41,894
When we get to Fort Dobbs,
who's gonna take care of her?

404
00:59:41,895 --> 00:59:47,697
I will, I will take care 
of her, but I don't need you.

405
00:59:47,698 --> 00:59:50,786
I hate you and I'm gonna
keep on hating you.

406
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:54,076
And someday I'm gonna kill you.

407
00:59:54,077 --> 00:59:56,884
Just like you did to my dad.

408
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:58,938
In the back.

409
01:00:56,539 --> 01:00:59,104
Mrs. Grey, we'd move out
any time you finished eating.

410
01:01:02,305 --> 01:01:03,793
We're finished.

411
01:01:45,294 --> 01:01:46,865
You'll make it alone from here.

412
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:49,022
Where are you going?

413
01:01:49,023 --> 01:01:52,319
I told you that. They likely waiting 
for me when I got there.

414
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,062
They wouldn't have to know.

415
01:01:55,663 --> 01:01:57,233
I'll tell them.

416
01:02:04,534 --> 01:02:05,967
Take care of your mother.

417
01:02:06,868 --> 01:02:08,355
Goodbye, Ms. Grey.

418
01:02:09,656 --> 01:02:10,603
Goodbye.

419
01:02:11,704 --> 01:02:12,569
Chad?

420
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:41,362
Give me the gun, Chad.

421
01:02:42,263 --> 01:02:43,893
Do you believe him?

422
01:02:44,394 --> 01:02:46,432
I believe what your father said.

423
01:02:47,233 --> 01:02:49,244
Sometimes things can 
look one way,

424
01:02:49,245 --> 01:02:52,334
and turn out to be 
all together something else.

425
01:02:55,335 --> 01:02:56,915
Give me the gun.

426
01:03:36,816 --> 01:03:37,639
Hello!

427
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,310
I'm Mrs. Grey,

428
01:03:40,311 --> 01:03:42,771
the Comanches burned our house.

429
01:05:54,772 --> 01:05:56,342
Get Chad inside.

430
01:06:06,661 --> 01:06:07,835
Get on the wall!

431
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:00,758
Who's in charge here?

432
01:07:01,159 --> 01:07:01,990
I am.

433
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:11,047
Hello, Gar.

434
01:07:12,448 --> 01:07:14,540
I heard you were dead on 
the bottom of that canyon.

435
01:07:14,541 --> 01:07:16,159
It seems it was wrong.

436
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:21,308
How soon they are 
gonna try us again?

437
01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:25,784
There is no telling, they've
got everything in their way.

438
01:07:25,785 --> 01:07:29,070
They won't be in any hurry 
to get it over with.

439
01:07:30,625 --> 01:07:32,619
We thought we would be safe here.

440
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:36,076
We started from Largo with 
15 wagons. The whole town.

441
01:07:37,377 --> 01:07:38,846
That's all that's left.

442
01:07:40,947 --> 01:07:43,999
You'd think they've had 
enough killing by now.

443
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,828
What are we gonna do?

444
01:07:49,229 --> 01:07:50,743
The only thing we can do...

445
01:07:52,344 --> 01:07:54,372
Bury the dead and wait.

446
01:07:57,773 --> 01:07:58,626
Gar...

447
01:07:59,627 --> 01:08:01,169
Just for the record,

448
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:03,267
if we get out of here...

449
01:08:03,868 --> 01:08:05,340
you're going back with me.

450
01:08:45,041 --> 01:08:46,543
Really quiet, aren't they?

451
01:08:47,344 --> 01:08:48,459
Too quiet.

452
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:17,498
Mrs. Grey?

453
01:09:18,099 --> 01:09:18,969
Yes.

454
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:21,782
Gar told me about your husband.

455
01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:26,547
He told you?

456
01:09:27,048 --> 01:09:28,262
Yes, ma'am.

457
01:09:29,663 --> 01:09:31,576
He said us how you thought he did it.

458
01:09:32,777 --> 01:09:35,202
A Comanche arrow killed 
your husband, Mrs. Grey.

459
01:09:36,203 --> 01:09:38,790
Gar traded clothes with him 
to keep him from hanging.

460
01:09:44,791 --> 01:09:47,342
What about the dead man in Largo?

461
01:09:47,843 --> 01:09:49,322
That's all together different.

462
01:09:50,623 --> 01:09:53,822
When Gar Davis first came to Largo
he was making his way with a gun.

463
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:57,624
For four years he was either
in trouble or in jail,

464
01:09:57,625 --> 01:09:58,679
and mostly both.

465
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,960
Then he met a woman.

466
01:10:02,261 --> 01:10:04,308
Talk had it they were 
gonna get married.

467
01:10:05,809 --> 01:10:07,841
Gar even went to work,

468
01:10:07,842 --> 01:10:09,369
outside the town.

469
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:12,335
At the end of the week
he'd coming to be with her.

470
01:10:14,136 --> 01:10:16,741
But in between, well...

471
01:10:17,042 --> 01:10:19,542
She didn't act like
a woman intended.

472
01:10:20,243 --> 01:10:22,548
There were those who told her that 
she was gonna get herself in trouble,

473
01:10:22,549 --> 01:10:24,359
carrying on behind Gar's back.

474
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,417
Taking up with this man, 
and then the next.

475
01:10:26,918 --> 01:10:28,311
But she wouldn't listen.

476
01:10:29,312 --> 01:10:30,861
One night she got herself hurt.

477
01:10:30,862 --> 01:10:33,031
The fellow she was running 
with had been drinking.

478
01:10:33,032 --> 01:10:36,152
He got mean, he beat her so
she could hardly walk.

479
01:10:36,953 --> 01:10:39,299
When Gar found out about it 
she lied to him,

480
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:40,885
just as she's been doing all along.

481
01:10:41,486 --> 01:10:44,479
She told him how the fellow had no 
call to do what he had done to her.

482
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,151
Gar believed her.

483
01:10:46,552 --> 01:10:48,033
He swore he'd kill him.

484
01:10:48,834 --> 01:10:50,901
I could have stooped him, Ms. Grey,

485
01:10:52,202 --> 01:10:55,109
but how do you tell a man 
that his woman is no good.

486
01:10:58,510 --> 01:11:00,018
How do you tell a man?

487
01:12:21,619 --> 01:12:22,666
Mr. Davis.

488
01:12:23,867 --> 01:12:24,818
Yes, ma'am?

489
01:12:24,819 --> 01:12:27,597
The sheriff told me 
what happened in Largo.

490
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:30,016
Did he?

491
01:12:31,117 --> 01:12:33,189
You must have loved her very much.

492
01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:37,243
I've been wrong all along, 
and I'm sorry.

493
01:12:38,844 --> 01:12:40,871
There's something the sheriff 
didn't tell you.

494
01:12:40,872 --> 01:12:43,097
That man, the one I killed,

495
01:12:43,698 --> 01:12:46,183
before he died he told me
how it was with her.

496
01:12:46,784 --> 01:12:49,317
I was the only one in 
Largo who didn't know.

497
01:12:50,418 --> 01:12:51,889
She was no good.

498
01:12:51,890 --> 01:12:55,068
The trouble is that I had to 
kill a man to find that out.

499
01:12:55,269 --> 01:12:56,725
What are you gonna do?

500
01:12:57,426 --> 01:13:00,439
That night, alone, if can I get
to Santa Fe and get help.

501
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,548
But they'll kill you.

502
01:13:03,449 --> 01:13:04,564
I'll try.

503
01:13:06,365 --> 01:13:08,371
Please don't do it.

504
01:13:11,072 --> 01:13:13,063
It's the only thing I can do.

505
01:13:14,664 --> 01:13:17,168
I thought it over.
It's the only chance we got.

506
01:13:17,169 --> 01:13:18,869
He is right, Ms. Grey.

507
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:20,350
Are you gonna let him go?

508
01:13:20,351 --> 01:13:22,462
Anybody can get through the dark.

509
01:13:22,463 --> 01:13:25,497
Fetch up a couple of wagons, 
and send them out empty.

510
01:13:25,698 --> 01:13:28,208
We can make them think we're 
trying to make a run for it.

511
01:13:28,209 --> 01:13:31,033
Maybe they'll keep them busy enough
to get me across that open ground.

512
01:13:31,725 --> 01:13:32,518
Right.

513
01:13:38,119 --> 01:13:39,005
Gar...

514
01:13:39,906 --> 01:13:41,094
Yes, ma'am?

515
01:13:42,495 --> 01:13:43,728
Be careful.

516
01:13:45,528 --> 01:13:46,718
I plan to.

517
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:11,907
Mr. Davis?

518
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:13,929
Good luck.

519
01:14:16,830 --> 01:14:18,301
Thanks, Chad.

520
01:14:22,002 --> 01:14:23,446
Are you ready?

521
01:14:24,047 --> 01:14:25,529
Ready as I'll ever be.

522
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:28,559
And Sheriff, just for 
that record of yours...

523
01:14:29,174 --> 01:14:32,680
The day I went looking for Johanson I 
didn't plan on killing him like I said,

524
01:14:34,481 --> 01:14:37,106
I just figured on beating 
him like he did to her.

525
01:14:37,107 --> 01:14:42,613
There was a gun on the table between us 
and he went for it, I had no choice.

526
01:14:43,214 --> 01:14:44,690
Don't keep us waiting.

527
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:49,625
Open them up!

528
01:14:59,426 --> 01:15:00,860
Move them out!

529
01:16:44,861 --> 01:16:46,217
You're looking for me?

530
01:16:49,918 --> 01:16:52,973
You could yourself be killed 
sneaking on a man that way.

531
01:16:54,974 --> 01:16:56,427
Where's that woman?

532
01:16:56,428 --> 01:16:58,211
I left her in Dobbs.

533
01:16:58,212 --> 01:16:59,960
And why did you do that for?

534
01:16:59,961 --> 01:17:03,090
Half the people in Largo are 
forted up there, they need help.

535
01:17:03,091 --> 01:17:05,202
What's the matter of 
all them soldiers?

536
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:07,350
The Comanches overrun them 
before we got there.

537
01:17:08,551 --> 01:17:10,622
They sent you out, huh?

538
01:17:12,623 --> 01:17:15,442
What are they trying to do?
Save themselves of the trouble hang you?

539
01:17:16,543 --> 01:17:20,587
I was going to Santa Fe, now that 
I found you, I won't have to.

540
01:17:21,388 --> 01:17:23,470
One more man ain't gonna do any good.

541
01:17:23,471 --> 01:17:25,382
I'm not talking about one man.

542
01:17:25,983 --> 01:17:27,967
I'm talking about these guns.

543
01:17:31,968 --> 01:17:34,040
They ain't for sale right now.

544
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:35,288
I ain't buying.

545
01:17:35,789 --> 01:17:37,783
It sounds like you 
want to take them.

546
01:17:37,784 --> 01:17:39,557
If I have to.

547
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:45,243
Gar, you got real lucky back there.

548
01:17:46,244 --> 01:17:49,381
Because I've got me a rule, 
I never fight a man over a woman,

549
01:17:50,382 --> 01:17:51,846
I think it ain't worth it.

550
01:17:53,447 --> 01:17:55,572
But these Henrys are something else.

551
01:17:55,573 --> 01:17:58,737
The Comanches are gonna be 
hitting Dobbs real quick.

552
01:17:58,738 --> 01:18:01,432
If we start now we can 
still be back in time.

553
01:18:02,333 --> 01:18:04,365
There's a lot of women 
and children there.

554
01:18:09,266 --> 01:18:11,879
I guess you don't understand, do you?

555
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:15,362
It's everything I got
wrapped up in them rifles.

556
01:18:16,563 --> 01:18:19,589
I'm gonna sell them in Santa Fe 
and I'm gonna ride out there rich.

557
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:23,811
Than I'm gonna keep clean out of 
this territory for a bit long.

558
01:18:25,012 --> 01:18:28,890
Now look Gar, there ain't no sense in
this going against each other like this.

559
01:18:30,191 --> 01:18:34,198
If it wasn't for me, you'd be dead back there
in that canyon where the Comanches jumped you.

560
01:18:34,199 --> 01:18:35,561
You remember that, don't you?

561
01:18:35,562 --> 01:18:37,163
Yeah, I remember.

562
01:18:37,564 --> 01:18:39,080
I figured you would.

563
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:41,530
Now, you know you're on the run
the same as I am.

564
01:18:42,231 --> 01:18:44,238
Why don't we just ride along together?

565
01:18:47,439 --> 01:18:49,528
I'm getting tired of 
being out here all alone.

566
01:18:50,529 --> 01:18:52,072
Give me a hand, Clett.

567
01:18:53,073 --> 01:18:56,541
Do you think if you save them back there
in Dobbs is gonna make any difference?

568
01:18:56,542 --> 01:19:00,105
They ain't got not use for the likes 
like you and me. They never will either.

569
01:19:03,206 --> 01:19:05,049
I'm taking the guns.

570
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:06,761
You wouldn't try it.

571
01:19:07,262 --> 01:19:09,336
It looks like there's no other way.

572
01:20:15,337 --> 01:20:17,162
What are they waiting for?

573
01:20:18,663 --> 01:20:20,682
They'll be along.

574
01:20:50,083 --> 01:20:51,526
Feeling better, Willy?

575
01:20:51,527 --> 01:20:53,534
- I'll be all right.
- Good.

576
01:20:57,235 --> 01:20:59,187
You men get back to the wall.

577
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:03,212
It won't do any good sheriff, there
ain't enough of us to hold on.

578
01:21:03,213 --> 01:21:06,236
If they clobber us like last time, 
they'll overrun us for sure.

579
01:21:06,237 --> 01:21:07,838
There just ain't enough of us, sheriff.

580
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:11,698
Yes, may I say we sent 
the wrong man for help.

581
01:21:11,699 --> 01:21:13,551
Like it or not, he's still running.

582
01:21:15,252 --> 01:21:16,707
You got a gun.

583
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:18,754
Nobody asked me.

584
01:21:18,755 --> 01:21:20,403
Nobody asked him either.

585
01:21:21,504 --> 01:21:23,587
Now get back up and
stay on the wall.

586
01:21:24,488 --> 01:21:26,129
Or give your guns to the women.

587
01:21:50,930 --> 01:21:52,400
There you are.

588
01:21:52,401 --> 01:21:53,283
Thank you, ma'am.

589
01:21:53,784 --> 01:21:54,861
Mrs. Grey?

590
01:21:56,162 --> 01:21:58,224
You'll be safer inside.

591
01:22:01,225 --> 01:22:02,708
Do you think he got through?

592
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:03,668
I hope so.

593
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:04,809
Sheriff...

594
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:21,332
Get on in with the boy, Mrs. Grey,

595
01:22:21,333 --> 01:22:23,301
You women get on inside the house.

596
01:22:23,302 --> 01:22:24,968
The men back on the wall!

597
01:25:18,969 --> 01:25:20,500
Open the gate!

598
01:27:13,201 --> 01:27:14,666
They had enough.

599
01:27:29,867 --> 01:27:31,396
Can I help?

600
01:27:31,897 --> 01:27:33,192
Yes, please.

601
01:27:34,693 --> 01:27:38,243
Well, they'll all be back 
in Largo in a few days.

602
01:27:38,244 --> 01:27:39,649
Yes, ma'am.

603
01:27:41,050 --> 01:27:42,452
What about yourself?

604
01:27:43,753 --> 01:27:45,228
I figure to go on to Santa Fe.

605
01:27:46,029 --> 01:27:47,515
I've been talking to the sheriff,

606
01:27:47,516 --> 01:27:50,234
and he said these two horses 
should bring in enough money for

607
01:27:50,235 --> 01:27:51,638
a coach pay to St. Louis.

608
01:27:52,839 --> 01:27:56,504
My family is there and 
they'll take care of us.

609
01:27:57,305 --> 01:27:58,448
I see.

610
01:28:00,449 --> 01:28:03,283
I wanna thank you for everything 
you've done for us.

611
01:28:06,784 --> 01:28:07,843
Mrs. Grey...

612
01:28:09,544 --> 01:28:11,435
I've been thinking it...

613
01:28:17,236 --> 01:28:20,423
That's your horse I'm riding,
you ought to take him along with you.

614
01:28:22,624 --> 01:28:25,596
I hope we can manage without him.

615
01:28:28,597 --> 01:28:30,067
Goodbye, madam.

616
01:28:32,868 --> 01:28:33,708
Goodbye.

617
01:28:42,009 --> 01:28:44,809
I understand Mrs. Grey and the 
boy are going on to Santa Fe.

618
01:28:44,810 --> 01:28:49,171
I don't suppose anybody would mind much if
you'd be riding along and see if they got there.

619
01:28:49,772 --> 01:28:52,035
Please, Mr. Davis?

620
01:28:52,436 --> 01:28:54,466
We've come this far together.

621
01:28:56,467 --> 01:28:57,299
Well?

622
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:00,532
You're forgetting something, 
aren't you sheriff?

623
01:29:01,733 --> 01:29:02,628
Yeah.

624
01:29:06,029 --> 01:29:08,043
All right, we're moving out!
