15
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,880

They are crazy.
-Here they are. That is fight.

32
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,080
He wanted them to do no harm.

00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:35,240
Not bad. If my head higher
had sat, there was now "in a hole.

34
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,920
Why are you hiding?

35
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,600
I'm Prospector. A gang
has stolen my horse. Poor me.

36
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,560
After they were gone,
I heard gunshots.

37
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:47,160
Oh yeah?
-Yes, over there.

You have a good set of eyes
in your head.

47
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,320
If I had a gold mine, I would
also have eyes in my butt.

48
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:31,160
Here.
Go ahead.

The Coma Chen

They are bad.
Burn all white people.

00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,560
No, Kipko. That is not true.
Alsje chief, I know that.

72
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,840
Some are friendly.
They do not die.

73
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,640
All whites are bad
and they should all die.

74
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,600
Tuwan says no.

75
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:49,240
We must discover why
our friends on bison hunting.

76
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,480
They are our bison. That is
in a signed paper.

77
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,480

00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:29,600
She is a lean beetie ...

81
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:32,520
Hey, moetie that.

82
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,120

83
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:48,360
How do you like that?
Where is my prize, sir?

84
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,120
I want the 1st prize.

00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,520

00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,480
Love you still.
Come on, get out.

87
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:02,760
I believe you can not count.
Come on, give her the prize.

88
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,240
Stay out of this.

89
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,200
That had you not to do.

90
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,640
Put me down, put me down.

91
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:29,480
Three times.
-Yes, and without cheating.

92
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,040

-Thank you!

94
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,400

-O, Uncle Ben.

95
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,520

She said that you were dead.
-lkke not hear.

97
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:47,000
What do you think of my niece?

98
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,200
Well, I think its not so skinny.

99
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,480
What have you gotten big,
Toby.

100
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,640
The city is committed trob opje.

101
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,520
I'm right help.
-If you look too.

102
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,200
Sir, you are legally
now guilty of mistreatment.

103
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,000
I think he deserves a kiss.
-Judith, right.

104
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,520
For her, I dug 2jaar
in the mountains. And I've geboft.

105
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,000
You mean ...
-Yes, at Devil head.

106
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,000
At the foot of the mountain.

107
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,560
Enough for a dowry.

108
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:25,720
Only alsje uncle's claim
submitted on time ...

109
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:28,680
voorbiipraat and not his mouth.

110
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,720
Uncle, who is this man?
-I do not know.

111
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,200
Since I am still behind.

112
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,720
I'd like a cold beer.

113
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,880
Hey, I'd like a beer.

114
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,960
Only when the Twilight incident.
Miss Molly that has so determined.

115
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:00,400
Can I perhaps
what music?

116
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,400
Listen, there is now
no music.

117
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,200
There he is.

118
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,640
You do spunky. You scratch now.
We are closed.

119
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,400
I would not zatlappen.
Listen, was scratched.

120
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,400
How are you, Molly?
-Johnny.

121
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,680
How you doing, honey?
That is a long-ago.

122
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:43,840
Where have you been?
-Yon.

123
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:47,600
And soon vert rack again.
You're nothing changed.

124
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:51,200
One door in
and the other door.

125
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:55,600
Who heeftje slain brother now?
-No idea, I still search ...

126
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:59,000
but the court seems
want to speak.

127
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,600
You know Molly, you are
to the day younger.

128
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,400
Chen have Coma
Mac Hara's slain son.

129
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,040
Who were there?
-A couple of strangers.

130
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,440
They reported it now before the courts.
-They 're actually seen.

131
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:25,120
How it happened, does not matter.
It's done.

132
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,960
That attack surprised me.
What was the purpose?

133
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:32,360
They had no purpose.
Ikjuist say that, Judge.

134
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,120
Seventy Indians started
just to shoot.

135
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,640
Are you sure?
-Yes, of course.

136
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,200
Sir, Indians never fall
without reason.

137
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,400
Moreover surprised 't me
you're away.

138
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,720
You are right, right.

139
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,320
That is very strange.

140
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:55,680
It is the good Chen Coma
Since it Convention.

141
00:16:55,879 --> 00:17:00,080
You can then just as well say
that they have robbed the train.

142
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:02,200
What do you say now?

143
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,520
The train with wage lists
was robbed at St Creek.

144
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,880
The passengers also?
-Yes, but I would send aid.

145
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:13,320
Toby, this is the man to whom I
had requested.

146
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,600
You know what you should do.
Go to the sherim.

147
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,080
Good stranger,
my assistant will arrange everything.

148
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,720
_jk, a Comanche.
-Come on, we seize him.

149
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,040
Those bloody red skins too.

150
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,760
Fuck this town.
Get out.

151
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,720
You, murderer.

152
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,960
Murderer, I kill you.
Give me your weapon.

153
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,800
But he was unarmed.
Let him speak.

154
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,680
Day, Tuwan.

155
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:45,600
Murder by getting your son
not returned.

156
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:49,720
You do not know how it is to keep your son
to be murdered.

157
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,920
He is innocent.
I am for him.

158
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,920
Are you satisfied now?

159
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:13,800
Are you satisfied now?

160
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,000
Welcome to Mason City.
It says' Welcome '.

161
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,240
Maki-motehs son
believed those words.

162
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,320
You have an unarmed
man killed.

163
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,760
"The tenth anniversary
City of Mason. "

164
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,200
This will allow you el! Birthday
are never experience.

165
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:02,640
Come inside.
-Are you alone, right?

166
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:06,720
Ah Johnny, I understand
that you wanted to remain incognito.

167
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,160
Hi, Dick.
-Good to see you.

168
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:13,240
Unfortunately, we have now
trouble.

169
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,160
Problems search me.
I'm looking really no problems.

170
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,400
I had the murder of that poor
kid but can occur.

171
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,360
Would you be the case with the Indians
can soothe?

172
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,480
You know them through and through.

173
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,280
Would you oveMregen?
-No, right.

174
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,880
I am not here for.
Why would you see me?

175
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:38,160
I know where Jeremy Sanders is.
-Jeremy?

176
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:40,960
That has my brother
not murdered.

177
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,240
That thought the rest, but I do not.

178
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,920
There 's a premium on his head.
A very big.

179
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,080
The government is searching for him all 3jaar.
They see him as the perpetrator.

180
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:56,720
Jeremy was practically family.

181
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,200
Find him
and go talk to him.

182
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,400
Well. Where is he?
-That will tell ikje now.

183
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:09,040
There is already 3 years' n hermit
on the Grizzly Mountain.

184
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,200
An Indian tree
has recognized him.

185
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,440
That is our man: Jeremy.

186
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,560
From now on I will win.
I'm broke.

187
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,840
You have a lot of money
of me winning.

188
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,000
This is perhaps sufficient.

189
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,800
Can I see?
-Of course.

190
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,720
Shuffling the cards than you
again?

191
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,400
This should not be found.
There's still mud on.

192
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,480
Yes, those golden eggs
are given fresh today.

193
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,680
Where is the chicken in these eggs?
-Here.

194
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,760
That you would like to see, HC?

195
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:05,960
This is the man I've seen.

196
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:13,160
How do you know so sure?
He seems not even to Jeremy.

197
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,240
I have seen his face.
He is.

198
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:22,040
Well. Judge
we begin morgenòchtend.

199
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,760
Yes, Schneider?
-The corpse of the Indian is gone.

200
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,120
Wait here.
Come on.

201
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:36,040
Where the corpse was, is now this stuff
like a kind of card.

202
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,320
Indians who are really mad.

203
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,040
Maki-moteh has his son
fetched.

204
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,200
The funeral will take exactly
three days.

205
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,920
And then?
-Then there will be war.

206
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:10,360
Unless you are the offender
brings to the chief.

207
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,040
What should I do?

208
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,680
Start at the bison poachers who
IOGEN on the Comanche attack.

209
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,040
But Bob Mac Hara
has been shot dead.

210
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,640
From the front or rear?
-MaaM that?

211
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:28,840
Help us with this case.
-No, right.

212
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,280
Schneider, more than this.

213
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:42,560
If something happens, I go to.

214
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:45,480
lndianen have my mom
and 3 brothers slain.

215
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,400
I've still only Uncle Ben.
-And me.

216
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,120
That is liefvan you,
But you can not even shoot.

217
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:56,800
I can still learn?
That be_ijfel-I.

218
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,160
You can learn sewing,
Like Webartikelen ...

219
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:02,880
but to shoot
talent is needed.

220
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:05,520
However, I can tell, though.

221
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,120
Silence again.

222
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:09,120
What is it?

223
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,520
No movement.

224
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,320
Goodbye, Judge.

225
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:24,880
Watch out.

226
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,560
Thank you, young lady.
-You 're welcome.

227
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:41,400
That is number one bison hunter.
Want to bet?

228
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,480
What is wrong?

229
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,800
I heard a shot.

230
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,400
You're right.

231
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:55,000
But why he wanted you
murder?

232
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,200
Maybe did my face
him, or something.

233
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,400
And the other?
-Will we arrest him?

234
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:05,200
For just as it ends like this.

235
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,440
Tom? Williams?
Bring him to the sherim.

236
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,800
Say that I come out.

237
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,160
Folks, go back home
and forget this.

238
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:16,360
Zoieb vergeetje not.

239
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,120
Good night.
-You also judge.

240
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:23,400
Good night, kids.
-I 'm coming.

241
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,480
Nothing.
You go to bed where you belong.

242
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,320
If they had been in bed,
was now dead.

243
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:34,760
That is true, young man.
So thanks again, jumrouw.

244
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,360
Why not show your thanks
clearer what?

245
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:42,600
What should I do that, ju_rouw?

246
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,120
You are a man
and I am a girl.

247
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,920
Judith, though.

248
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,800
You remind me of somebody.

249
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,400
What did they look?
O, she was just as nice as u.

250
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,200
Toby.
-That you still want him?

251
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,680
Listen, if someone you coast,
I am.

252
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,640
You know not.
He is a real man.

253
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,560
You are a book worm.

254
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:22,560
Toby again, this shooting
has established consequences.

255
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,600
Hello, Ben.
-Good evening.

256
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,080
Get out of here.
You've just killed someone.

257
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:45,040
He deserved the death
because he was a criminal.

258
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,440
Criminals must stiff you.

259
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,880
From whom is this correct
Opinion?

260
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:53,120
My name is O'Neal.
Jack O'Neal.

261
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:56,160
My company wants here 'n branch
settle.

262
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,960
What makes your company?

263
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:02,120
Weapons and machinery.
-What a combination.

264
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:05,200
Destruction and construction.

265
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,120
Moetjij not go to court?
That can-tomorrow too.

266
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:11,720
It also said the overnight flight.

267
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,600
These are all gentlemen, you know.
-Men, did you say?

268
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,640
Hey, gotta see that again.

269
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,360
Put your money down, mister.

270
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:28,160
You're a cheat.
-Toby.

271
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:32,040
Hebje that is not needed.

272
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,680
S what I saw ...

273
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:43,360
Here we go again.

274
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,800
Guys, stop.
Kappen, I said.

275
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,680
Help.
-Come.

276
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,920
_jk go.

277
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:32,400
Fast. Stand up.
-Judith, beware.

278
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,640
Everybody out.

279
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:19,160
The champion.

280
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:25,000
That fell against HC?
-For 's book worm was' t it.

281
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,240
Please.
That is free.

282
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,240
Hello, young man. You fight well,
but please note on your chin.

283
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,560
I wish you best give some tips.
-I 'm do without. Thank you.

284
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,600
Uncle Ben.

285
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,320
Uncle Ben.

286
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:33,200
They have 't gold
and the card stolen.

287
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,720
Did he 's recognized?

288
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,640
Was it an Indian?
-No.

289
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,800
Toby ...
-Yes, Ben?

290
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,760
Soon it is up to you ...

291
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,920
Why so nervous?
-I 'm not.

292
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,360
That's a sign.
Manitou does not want ikje initiated.

293
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:25,320
That is not Manitou.
-The pass is there. You can find him so.

294
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:29,200
Hey, come back.

295
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,160
Hurry. Come on.

296
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,000
Calm down. Ho, kid.
Come here.

297
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,520
Come on, kid.

298
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,200
What a onhangst, HC?

299
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,440
Jeremy.

300
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,920
Jeremy.

301
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,080
Jeremy, I know you there
within it.

302
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,800
Get out. Leave me alone.
Been scratched.

303
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,480
Jeremy, put the gun down.

304
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,480
Be not afraid.
I am. Johnny Garden.

305
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,440
Hold on,
maaM you scared my horse.

306
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,800
Why Do you believe me?
I'm Johnny Garden.

307
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,160
That is what you say.
Johnny is my buddy.

308
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,280
And if his voice sounds not.
And now opgerot. Get out.

309
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,080
You stubborn donkey. I tell you anyway
I'm Johnny Garden.

310
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,400
Prove it then.

311
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,800
Johnny was from 300 meters
from the heart 'n bait shooting.

312
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,520
Oh, you ...

313
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:15,640
Well, then.
Come on, kid.

314
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,320
I'm ready.

315
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,920
Johnny.
-Yes, whom do you expect?

316
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,720
Hello, Johnny.
I am.

317
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,760
My god, old man.

Look, that's better. So I know
Wobble my old again.

322
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:32,640
Thanks, Johnny.

323
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:37,360
Sorry old man, that thing
I have nothing to do.

324
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:41,280
But after the murder of my brother
's money away and you, too.

325
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,480
So when the state thought
datjij something to do with it.

326
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:53,040
Dachtjij that?
Dachtjij that it was me?

327
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:57,320
Come on, say.
You know better.

328
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:00,400
But why are you when
disappeared?

329
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:04,960
I would not go away,
but I was Estimated.

330
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,440
I fell faint in the bushes
and when I return bij_am ...

331
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:16,440
said the sheriff:
I want him dead or alive.

332
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:19,160
He thought I
the killer was.

333
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,360
They would not believe me anyway
So I raaMe in panic.

334
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:27,880
And when I go here.
Poor-old Wobble.

335
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,480
Al diejaren on your own
for nieb.

336
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:36,880
Toe old man, tell me
Who has killed my brother.

337
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:39,720
I really do not know that.

338
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,440
You've seen yet
how he looked?

339
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:46,480
I do not know anymore.
They were all masked.

340
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:50,000
I therefore do not recognize.

341
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:53,000
I really do not know.
I'm sorry.

342
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:55,040
I know it.

343
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,200
Then I'm back to square one
and I still know nothing.

344
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,760
I swore
that I would avenge my brother.

345
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,280
Now I will have my word
break.

346
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,760
No, do not.
We start immediately.

347
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,120
Why? Now?
Yes.

348
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,360
Now hebje me
to the affairs.

349
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,640
That is true, old man.
Without you I am nothing.

350
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,520
Are you really?
-Of course.

351
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,800
Jii is my talisman.

352
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,960
Come on.
-Wait a minute.

353
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:32,360
First, my hat and gun yet.

354
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:36,280
But her take longer than expected.
-No?

355
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,360
Sure Hand. Hey, Sure Hand ...

356
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,640
I just remember something.
-What then?

357
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:56,240
They were masked, but
I have 'a name heard.

358
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,360
Which name?
-I forgot.

359
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:02,520
Do not be silly. Which name?
-Listen, that name was ...

360
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,880
What was that name?

361
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:16,720
They called someone
the general.

362
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,320
A General, HC?

363
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:23,200
Sure Hand, why this man wanted
murder me?

364
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,480
Perhaps he wanted not
that you would betray his name.

365
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:30,520
Yes, of course.
That's a good point.

366
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:34,720
Say, if I go metjou ...

367
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,800
and they see that I am still alive
try it again.

368
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,680
Yes, but not maakje pressure.
I note opje.

369
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,280
On second thoughts
my cave like me actually.

370
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:54,240
I like living here.
I'll stay here. I am not them.

371
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,760
Wobble.

372
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,600
Had you thought Wobble
IAF was?

373
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,400
What? Who said that?
Listen, I'm happy here.

374
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,440
I would really love to help you ...

375
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:10,680
but your one horse
We can not both contribute.

376
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,680
I'm sorry.
But understand it, HC?

377
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,080
Look what it says?

378
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,720
Oh, there is a horse.

379
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:25,480
, In the saddle.
Crazy guy.

380
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:42,160
I am a super spoorzoeker.
These are Comanche Trace.

381
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,640
Coma Chen, HC?
Come on, tell more.

382
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,040
There is also little to tell.

383
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:51,200
There is someone.

384
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,040
I feel that my water.

385
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,120
How do you know it?
-Well, I'm afraid.

386
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,480
Look, I beef altogether.
-That says nothing. You always tremble.

387
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:05,600
But you are right.
We are viewed.

388
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,480
Where is he?
-Oh, you do not need.

389
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:13,080
Winnetou Okay, come now
appear.

390
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:24,000
I knew that my friend the tracks
my horse would recognize.

391
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:26,440
Comanche Trace, HC?
-Oh ...

392
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:28,440
You come for the drums.

393
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:34,080
Maki-moteh collect aid
for a war against the whites.

394
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,240
We must stop them.
I was going to Maki-moteh.

395
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,160
Listen, there are now whites
in the camp of Maki-moteh.

396
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,600
She promised him 100 guns
for a piece of barren land.

397
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,280
You know how that whites are called?
-No.

398
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,120
But the oldest of the _ee
General was mentioned.

399
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:00,280
Maybe he will.
-I told you I would regulate it.

400
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,960
Good old Wobble.
My talisman. Come on.

401
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:12,560
And, Toby?
-This is more fun than the office.

402
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,880
What begins' t Comanche Country?
We are al -

403
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:20,680
Before we go stroomopwaarb,
equip us. Good?

404
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,600
I got hungry and we are only
after dark at Devil head.

405
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,600
Hopefully we find route
the killer remains.

406
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,800
I want that card back.
-And if he does not want to give?

407
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,800
We need him dead.
That murderers deserve.

408
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
No Judith, even murderers
deserve a fair trial.

409
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:40,800
You were great.
I had never thought of that.

410
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,160
Why do not you shot?
-Because he can not lap.

411
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:48,400
What do we do with him?

412
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:53,280
You would really have to question
: what do they do with us?

413
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,800
Fast.

414
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,800
Come, bukje.
She let them dry in the sun.

415
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,080
That is bad. I once three days
led to some doubt.

416
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,880
Liar,
that means nobody vol.

417
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,360
Now I think about it, can
days have been included.

418
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,960
What should we do?

419
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:51,280
We have to swim there
and liberate them.

420
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:00,480
What is it?
-Eh, I can not swim.

421
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:02,800
Come on.

422
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:06,240
You, stupid ...

423
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,040
Wait here.

424
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,280
Forgive me, Judith.
It's all my fault.

425
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,880
I never got to Haj
take.

426
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:25,080
It is not iouw debt, Toby.

427
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,800
You have to blame me,
because now we are ...

428
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,240
perhaps killed.

429
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:48,000
Come on, hurry up.

430
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,400
Whatever happens,
you need to know ...

431
00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:00,040
I altiid you've taken.

432
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:04,520
Toby O,
I love you, too.

433
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,520
No matter what happens.

434
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:23,920
We are not yet dead.

435
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:28,640
Hey, you. Get your head.
I want him to talk.

436
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,320
He will get him.
Go to the chief.

437
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,760
Zieje what I see?

438
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:46,000
Do not come up.

439
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,280
They can not play.
Resistance is useless.

440
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,200
It can not face turned away.
Our rope is too strong.

441
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,920
Thank you.
-Take the boat.

442
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:10,360
And you?
-I 'm so. Haastje.

443
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:12,240
Wobble, get the horses.

444
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:09,360
If I 's chief released
He Iaat me finish?

445
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:11,760
I give you my word.

446
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,200
Speak.

447
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:22,640
They say it's Maki-moteh
son wants revenge with a war.

448
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,440
That is true.
-To the death of a man ...

449
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:27,640
many tribal members die.

450
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:32,520
So be it.
-And just because it is your son?

451
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,920
If I bring you the offender ...

452
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:38,480
Then there will be peace,
Old Hand Sure.

453
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:41,200
Can you?
-I will bring you the man.

454
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,520
If you're not back
for the drums silence ...

455
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:47,280
we will attack.

456
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,960
I will do my best.

457
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:52,080
Time is running out. Remember that.
-I know.

458
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,800
This is only a real man.

459
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,800
Moetjeje not dress
for he is?

460
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,040
My clothes are still wet, and I want
see how he reacts to me.

461
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:18,400
He will laugh as he introduces you
ant hill that looks lie.

462
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:20,240
Please.

463
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:31,720
Sure Hand, you were great.

464
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,320
Forget it.
What do you still here?

465
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:38,840
We are looking for my Uncle Bens
and his killer.

466
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:43,160
You never find my Bens
in them days. This is madness.

467
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,760
This is no place for a girl.
-I know.

468
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,960
That moetie say to her.

469
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:52,840
Hey, Wobble.
-Here I am.

470
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:55,840
Well done.
Fine. Are good, HC?

471
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:03,960
Stop.

472
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:07,040
Wait here a minute.

473
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,000
Is there any news?

474
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:19,880
Poor nieum:
Fort Brighton send soldiers.

475
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:24,200
Maki-moteh will you be in debt
and then there will be war.

476
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,160
The cavalry is
always a bad time.

477
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,320
Can you stop them?
-I will do my best.

478
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:32,760
Winnetou has more
nieu_.

479
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,000
General who you want,
Here is nearby.

480
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:39,320
The Coma Chen have
100 guns from him purchased.

481
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:44,920
He sits in the old post office.
Two hours drive to 't west.

482
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,360
I look forward to all three years that
meeting.

483
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,040
BedanM, old friend.

484
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:53,480
Winnetou is pleased
that he could help.

485
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:07,000
Fort Brighton has soldiers
sent.

486
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:09,280
Someone should stop them.

487
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:13,400
Why look at me?
-You have to do. Go soon.

488
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:17,120
Say you do that to me
to come?

489
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,360
It's a male job.
You can find it sometimes too dangerous?

490
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:22,960
Well, I do it.

491
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:28,040
General Brown say on my behalf
that he pulls back its soldiers.

492
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:30,320
Do not worry, I do.
Fine.

493
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:32,680
He has no weapon.
-Wobble?

494
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,680
Come on.
-What? My arms?

495
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:40,560
Thank you.

496
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,320
Be careful.
-I 'm so.

497
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,640
Will he care of yourself fit?

498
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,640
Come on, we are going to the General
search by the post office.

499
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,760
Well, you know.
Really?

500
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,800
I told you:
With me there Lum it.

501
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,920
Would anybody be?
-You must.

502
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:26,560
My nose says that there
chicken soup on the fire state.

503
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,360
The coast is clear.

504
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,200
You scared me.

505
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,960
We thought this house
was uninhabited.

506
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:03,480
Come on.
I'm pleased with the company.

507
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:05,880
The best is lonely.

508
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:08,760
Do you live here alone?
-Most of the time.

509
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,000
My husband is opjacht.
-Check this out, Johnny.

510
00:53:12,199 --> 00:53:15,160
My friend has quite hungry.

511
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:20,960
Stay still eat.
-Please. You can 't miss it?

512
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:25,280
I always make too much for
the case my husband comes home.

513
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:29,000
Where can I find the signs?
-Here.

514
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:33,320
I am eager.

515
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:37,080
Have you recently
seen strangers?

516
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,760
We are looking for a friend.

517
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,120
No, I've been over 'n month
nobody seen.

518
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:50,360
Strange. I thought outside
to see fresh tracks.

519
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:55,600
Right. That is crazy, because I have
nobody has seen weeks.

520
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,200
The soup looks good,
hc Wobble?

521
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,560
So can I 'm not create.

522
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:11,120
We were still only, you said?
All-forgotten.

523
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:15,800
My father is sick upstairs.
He is crippled.

524
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,240
Eat more reassured.
I look just what he wants. See you soon.

525
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:23,720
She is very gashrij, HC?

526
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,000
Would it really her father ZiiN?

527
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:29,080
For a lame
he makes a lot of tracks.

528
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,520
What is this a delicious soup.

529
00:54:31,719 --> 00:54:34,200
If you schranst,
you get abdominal pain.

530
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,960
Who knows when we again
Iekker eat.

531
00:54:37,159 --> 00:54:40,200
Is it that big?
-Yes, you doetje job well.

532
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,800
The next step, you know.
-Yes, Jim. The bottle of wine.

533
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,600
When they sleep, I care
that they never get up.

534
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:52,640
You can not force me to him
to murder. That is common.

535
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:56,000
But Della, this is all
for you.

536
00:54:56,199 --> 00:54:58,920
I don 't alone
if we get out here.

537
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,920
I nevertheless promised hebje
that we here?

538
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:05,360
Well Jim,
I will do what you say.

539
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,400
Everything good?
-Yes, sure.

540
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,800
He wanted to know
who was there.

541
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,400
That chicken soup was delicious.
Can I still 'n portion?

542
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:23,960
Go ahead.
But it was rattlesnake soup.

543
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:27,640
That is my specialty.
You to fine him was nice.

544
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,480
Rattlesnake ...

545
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:33,480
Hey pal, have some soup?

546
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:36,400
No, thank you so.

547
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:38,520
My belly rattle quite.

548
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:43,280
Come on, a little bit. Here.
-No, no.

549
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,720
I want celebrating your arrival
with a bottle of wine.

550
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:51,360
What a gashrijheid.
Now refurbished on my belly.

551
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:54,320
Well, cheers.
-Shame Wobble. Ladies first.

552
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:57,080
Relax, soon to become drunk.

553
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,800
No, never Wobble
drunk.

554
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,440
Thank you. Good wine.
Rattlesnake soup. Unbelievable.

555
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:14,960
It works really well.

556
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,600
Wobble what are you doing
on the ground?

557
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:39,680
Wobble, you're drunk.

558
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:43,480
Nothing thereof. I'm just tired.
-Moe, HC?

559
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:48,800
Do you have a room where my friend
can sleep? He is tired.

560
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,200
That way.
-The rattlesnake.

561
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,120
Excuse me.

562
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:03,280
I'm so sober ...

563
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,560
as it can.

564
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:11,160
Rattlesnake soup, HC?

565
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,800
Killing your friend always chairs?
-Excuse me.

566
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,960
The wine was certainly very strong.
So I know him not at all.

567
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:25,040
Mr. Garden, I ...

568
00:57:25,239 --> 00:57:29,200
I do not know what to do with me
going on ...

569
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:36,280
Here we go again.
That was me the wine did.

570
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:46,200
Wobble, sliding once again.

571
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,800
Rattlesnake soup ...

572
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:07,880
Tell me, what was in that wine?
-What a stupid question, Sure Hand.

573
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:10,920
Go on, go in again.

574
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,320
Keep moving.

575
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,360
Jim.

576
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:20,440
Jim?

577
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,000
Jim, come on down.
It is governed.

578
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:34,240
For the security Blijfjij
but here.

579
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:37,960
Jim ...
-No panic.

580
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:42,400
The General gives us
$ 2000 for our work.

581
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:45,560
So there it is.
What a beautiful sight.

582
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,040
I make him in his sleep.

583
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:53,080
If I murder him go,
I can 't do better now.

584
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,600
Now you are the person
who has not killed me.

585
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:11,480
I hebje wine data. Your
must have been drinking.

586
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:14,320
I actually drink
only beer and whiskey.

587
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:18,120
Doeje hands but slowly
up.

588
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:51,720
I do not shoot at women.
-As you get sorry.

589
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,200
You would want You to me
was murdered. Filthy pig.

590
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,800
I kill you slowly
and I will enjoy your suffering.

591
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,960
Do eerstje hands
but it 's up.

592
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:10,040
What is that noise?

593
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:14,800
How can I sleep well
with all that geknal around me?

594
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,000
Fort Brighton is there?

595
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:36,880
What should you do?
-Are you nothing.

596
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:40,880
Isn 't that way?
-You need something polite questions.

597
01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:42,800
It is that way.

598
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,960
Come with us.
We go to the general.

599
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:49,160
I got a important message
for General Brown.

600
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:50,800
Come, then we go.

601
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,000
Squadrons, halt.

602
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:07,600
That did hurry.
-Yes, quite.

603
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,400
It is a white and
with others. A woman.

604
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,800
Is my message is not on_angen?
-What message?

605
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,160
Who are you?
I Sure Hand-hot.

606
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:24,640
Right. I've heard of you.
-I bring you quickly up to date.

607
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,120
Should this Fort Brighton
proposals?

608
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,080
Dirty dogs.

609
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:54,240
You are here
in the labyrinth of death.

610
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:58,440
Foryou comes only from
alsje the road well.

611
01:01:58,639 --> 01:02:02,320
The General is waiting inside of you.
-Get inside, you.

612
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:18,280
92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99.
Exactly 100.

613
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,040
Why hide your card
for me?

614
01:02:25,239 --> 01:02:27,480
Let 's see where Ben took gold.

615
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:32,080
Look, Joe.
Turn not such a tone with me.

616
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,760
I'm the boss here,
So you do what I say.

617
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,240
Wii still share everything?

618
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:42,000
You can even view the map.
-I am done talking.

619
01:02:42,199 --> 01:02:45,680
General, General. ..
-What is it?

620
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:48,640
The boys have a strange
brought.

621
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:54,000
On whose authority is he here?
-He was abducted on Pofters warrant.

622
01:02:54,199 --> 01:02:58,360
Who is the boss? Potter or I?
Wind-you do not like.

623
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,680
This guy had a message for
General Brown.

624
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,840
Since you supposedly
General re ...

625
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:10,000
I was a lieutenant in 's army
of the confederation.

626
01:03:10,199 --> 01:03:11,840
Come and get out.

627
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:20,360
Where is Pofter now?
-That 's hand Surefire back to Old.

628
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:25,240
Then he must be careful.
But let 's op. He is a hard.

629
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,640
Oh, I kenjou.
-That 's correct.

630
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:35,720
You work with Judge Edwards
in Mason City.

631
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,440
By chance I am his assistant.

632
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:42,920
You had a message of Sure Hand
for General Brown.

633
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:48,120
What was that message?
-I say nothing more.

634
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:52,760
You sense, but knot in your ears
I'm the boss here.

635
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:57,880
You have a half hour waiting period. As
you want to talk to you and that is down ...

636
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:00,800
but you call a guard.
Guard?

637
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,960
How are you, young man?

638
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:46,160
Besefje that you do
no chance?

639
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:51,160
Time is running out.
Would you tell me something?

640
01:04:52,599 --> 01:04:55,080
Fine, ste_je then.

641
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:02,640
Too bad that you
on the wrong side.

642
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,960
If 't Indian army field
enters ...

643
01:06:17,159 --> 01:06:19,760
is not to prevent a war.

644
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:24,320
But I must Chen Coma
to watch them in action.

645
01:06:24,519 --> 01:06:27,000
You bet
that they will do so.

646
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:29,840
I got my orders.
-Toe, captain.

647
01:06:30,039 --> 01:06:33,320
Sometimes it eerzamer
to 'n order not to perform.

648
01:06:33,519 --> 01:06:36,320
What would you do in miin position?

649
01:06:36,519 --> 01:06:38,280
Do you know the Valley of Skeleften?

650
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,560
No. Maybe my tree.
Boniah, come here.

651
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:45,720
Is it reliable?
One hundred-percent.

652
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:48,200
Boniah, this man he wants to speak.

653
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,120
Boniah? So called hunters
in Coma Chen.

654
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:54,840
Are you a Comanche?
-No, a Pueblo.

655
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:57,000
I've always lived here.

656
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,880
Ken JII the Valley of the Skeletons?

657
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:03,560
Yes, on the edge of the area
Coma of Chen.

658
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,160
He knows what it is.
-Good, Boniah. You can go.

659
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,560
You go over there and watch.

660
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,680
Whatever you do,
In no case open fire.

661
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:16,160
If your men stay calm,
this battle is won.

662
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:19,920
Well, I do what you want.
But if it goes wrong ...

663
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:22,160
I come before the firing squad.

664
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:26,320
Please adhere to my friend and she?
Thank you.

665
01:07:26,519 --> 01:07:30,120
You stay here.
I am looking for Toby.

666
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:34,840
Find him, please.
It is my fault that he is here.

667
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,120
Quietly, I bring him back.

668
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,600
Really, I still prefer cutting
my tongue off.

669
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:56,240
Explain why you agree Caucasian
brothers hate.

670
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:01,320
It was a trifle.
I cheated at 't play poker ...

671
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:05,000
and when I had 's army from.
-Maki-moteh snaptje.

672
01:08:05,199 --> 01:08:07,120
The horses are loaded.

673
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:12,000
If you keep your word, you get
one tenth of Devil head.

674
01:08:12,199 --> 01:08:14,200
It is yours.
Take it.

675
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:19,800
Toe, inwards again.

676
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:39,760
A nice commodity.
-I hope you 're right.

677
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,520
What do you mean?
-There is still a problem.

678
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,800
Soon is it is not gold.

679
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,440
Listen, I was a lieutenant.
I can read the map.

680
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,920
Four eyes see more than that.

681
01:08:52,119 --> 01:08:57,000
Well, I've Maki-motehs son
Estimated different from 100 meters.

682
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:08,600
Did you hear that? He is the offender.
-You heard it too.

683
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:13,040
My words have
much authority among the Indians ...

684
01:09:13,239 --> 01:09:16,960
but in a rechbzaal be
only whites believed.

685
01:09:17,159 --> 01:09:19,760
You can 't post
find?

686
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:22,600
Sure Hand I say it
where the General is.

687
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:26,000
Tuwan say that he has slain.
-What are you gonna do?

688
01:09:26,199 --> 01:09:28,520
I'll follow the killer.

689
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:31,640
Sure Hand must be quick,
because at dawn ...

690
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:36,160
silence the drums of death.
-I will be blazing fast.

691
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:39,160
Wait a minute.
I have no horse.

692
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,000
Look.

693
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:46,680
The horse is best for you.

694
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,000
Sure Hand.

695
01:10:20,199 --> 01:10:23,240
What doejij there?
-I am in the water cases.

696
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:26,840
There is but one waterpoel
and you fall in it.

697
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:31,320
Why are you not 't Fort?
-Listen, I've discovered something.

698
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,720
What then?
-The General Tuwan killed.

699
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:37,960
Can you prove that?
-He seized on there.

700
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:40,800
Well done.
That should Maki-moteh know.

701
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,520
And the general then?
-That we find later.

702
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:48,560
I wait for three years,
So three hours there may still be at.

703
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,360
There they are with their new
guns.

704
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:22,280
What do you know?
-The Squadrons attracts a fight.

705
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:24,160
They wait for Maki-moteh.

706
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:25,680
Where are they?

707
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:29,000
Their goal was
the Valley of Skeleften ...

708
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:32,360
So I got them to the Valley
Gil brought the Lost.

709
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:36,720
Good. They will not
Maki-motehs escape revenge.

710
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:39,160
We must warn them.
Come on.

711
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:56,160
Where is that gold?
-That I am not saying.

712
01:11:56,359 --> 01:11:59,760
We want to see that map.
Where is it gold? Speak.

713
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:02,960
There, in exactly crucifixion.
-Look out.

714
01:12:03,159 --> 01:12:07,360
Are you crazy?
-No, I did everything in their hands.

715
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:12,040
That map is now in my head.
There should be nothing over me.

716
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:17,640
Avoid that I become sick, give
me to eat me and my gun alone.

717
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:21,800
Your fear that I 's secret
take in my grave ...

718
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,560
is the best life insurance
I can wish.

719
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,440
My dishonor onblag
they may regret.

720
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,880
Wobble Oh, thank God
he is back.

721
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:37,520
Not bad.
-Toby.

722
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,800
Where is your tree?
-No idea.

723
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
It is a traitor.
He is now in Maki-moteh.

724
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:50,520
I have them shoot traitor.
Otherwise, I do okay.

725
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:56,240
How are you doing, old man?

726
01:12:56,439 --> 01:13:00,200
I want to go back to my cave.
Since I had to be maintained.

727
01:13:00,399 --> 01:13:02,240
This valley was still your idea?

728
01:13:02,439 --> 01:13:05,720
I said the Valley Skeletons of.
Not the Lost Gil.

729
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:09,640
Do you have the killer?
-No, but I know where he is.

730
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:13,280
Say that but against Maki-moteh.
Easy-General.

731
01:13:13,479 --> 01:13:17,800
What? If the Coma Chen us
here are surprised we lost.

732
01:13:19,319 --> 01:13:21,880
Unfortunately, they surprised us all.
Look.

733
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:27,800
Mlm on, old man.

734
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,880
That is the martial.
If I still alive.

735
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:33,640
Not give up, captain.

736
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,520
I will see what I can do.
Good luck.

737
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:41,400
No, you stay here to
to protect these people.

738
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:45,080
Hear Blazer ...

739
01:13:45,279 --> 01:13:47,440
bladder "alarm".
Come on.

740
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,600
Maki-moteh Yes, you're right.

741
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:12,920
It would be murder.
They have no chance.

742
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,720
Road weapons.

743
01:14:18,399 --> 01:14:21,240
Old Hand Has Sure nieu_
Maki-moteh for?

744
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:25,360
Chief, I am a traitor
execute.

745
01:14:58,399 --> 01:15:02,720
I do not like traitors
or they just white or red.

746
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:07,400
Boniah was useful, but weak.
Sure Hand has acted properly.

747
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,320
And? Did you killer
by Maki al-motehs son?

748
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:15,240
No, but I know who he is,
and also where he is.

749
01:15:15,439 --> 01:15:20,040
The drums of death remain silent.
My warriors want to fight.

750
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:24,160
Who is the killer?
-It 's your arms supplier.

751
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:26,560
It is the general.
-Not true.

752
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,120
I never lie.

753
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:31,720
You tried to hebtje
the murderer of your son.

754
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,520
Hii was not.

755
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:36,600
You're no friend,
but a traitor.

756
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,520
If whites in emergency screening,
they always lie. I am now.

757
01:16:03,039 --> 01:16:05,880
Maki-moteh want to Winnetou
Iuisteren?

758
01:16:06,079 --> 01:16:10,760
Winnetou is a white friend.
He will die with the rest.

759
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,840
That makes for moteh-Maki.

760
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:16,120
What awaits Maki-moteh
still on?

761
01:16:16,319 --> 01:16:18,680
Would he like revenge ...

762
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:23,560
that he is the difference between
good and evil no longer see?

763
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,800
Why shoot Maki-moteh not?

764
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,960
That he never dum.

765
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:31,160
Winnetou take too much risk.
-I know why.

766
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:33,640
Friendship is everything for him.

767
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:37,800
Schietje why not?
Maki-moteh is sometimes cowardly?

768
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:10,840
Maki-motehs hand trembles.
So I will give the order.

769
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:14,600
Listen, Chen Coma ...

770
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,920
I am here.

771
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,880
Hurry.

772
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:36,720
Questions jullieje off
why Winnetou still alive?

773
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:40,480
The General wanted more
than a piece Devil head.

774
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:44,280
He gafjullie loose flodders
and hoped opjullie death.

775
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:48,920
Then he would very Devil Skop
beziften, including the gold mine.

776
01:17:49,119 --> 01:17:51,840
Yes, he has the map
in his head.

777
01:17:52,039 --> 01:17:56,480
Winnetou has come for you
to prove that this is true.

778
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:01,320
I thank Manitou
I'm not too late.

779
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,320
I am pleased with your arrival.
I am sorry.

780
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:07,200
Then enter the heart of swab.

781
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,680
Maki-motehs grief maaMe
him blind. He embarrassed.

782
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:31,200
That does not.
To err is human.

783
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:37,760
Chief,
I got a nice idea.

784
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:41,040
Let your men and loose
flodders shooting.

785
01:18:41,239 --> 01:18:44,160
Then shoot 's army in the air.
-Simple.

786
01:18:44,359 --> 01:18:47,200
If the soldiers then
lie ...

787
01:18:47,399 --> 01:18:52,040
the crooks will definitely
the 'similar' to rob.

788
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:54,440
Then we tackle them.
-Good idea.

789
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,600
Have fun.

790
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,960
I have an appointment now
with the general.

791
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:03,040
Winnetou is doin 'it.

792
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:06,360
No, I am waiting here for three iaar on.

793
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,640
This is a family matter.
Do you understand?

794
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:10,760
Listen to my advice.

795
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:15,240
Take 't path along the river
and barring the secret exit.

796
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:18,600
Thanks, Winnetou.
Sure Hand ...

797
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:23,480
Doin 'Can I come?
Yes. You're practically family.

798
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:25,120
Goodbye.

799
01:19:25,319 --> 01:19:26,760
Come on.

800
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:03,240
That sounds like me music
in the ears.

801
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:08,520
Go there. Who is still alive, make
you. Then the mine of us.

802
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,160
I am not going. That is too risky.

803
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:15,320
Like a lost ball hits me,
the gold mine is nowhere to be found.

804
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,760
You're right.
It is a lot better ...

805
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,440
if someone you bewaaM.

806
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:24,160
Mike, Blacky ...

807
01:20:24,359 --> 01:20:28,960
monitor our good friend
and leave him alone. Understood?

808
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:34,240
Maakje not worry, Joe.
We will 'm not offend her.

809
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:43,800
After you, General.

810
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:31,560
Liiken who rob, guys.

811
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:43,880
Grab what you can tackle.

812
01:21:57,479 --> 01:21:59,360
Let your arms fall.

813
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:07,640
Hands opje head.

814
01:22:09,039 --> 01:22:12,120
Listen well, a joke
and it is over.

815
01:22:12,319 --> 01:22:16,560
Come on, give me a reason to
fire, that is because I love.

816
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,240
Your turn.

817
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,920
Here you are arrested.

818
01:22:23,119 --> 01:22:26,280
How did you let the General
escape?

819
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:29,160
Well, hebjii as lucky.

820
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:42,000
Sergeant, who on_apen men
and buoy them.

821
01:22:42,199 --> 01:22:44,360
Collect the weapons.

822
01:22:48,119 --> 01:22:50,440
Mii shoot would be foolish.

823
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:54,320
That we need gold
man with a lot of parts.

824
01:22:58,079 --> 01:23:01,560
Put away those weapons
and tell me where Satan is Skop.

825
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,280
What do you mean?
-We are with his three.

826
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:07,200
If we share, we can
quiet lifestyles.

827
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:09,360
So that mean you.

828
01:23:18,319 --> 01:23:20,680
Now we divide it among ...

829
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,440
That never?

830
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:27,080
Right? General?
Sorry, Blacky. Now it 's mine.

831
01:23:37,319 --> 01:23:40,760
Who would still life, denkje?
-The General.

832
01:23:42,319 --> 01:23:44,680
I take that side.
You stay here.

833
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,360
And if he comes out then ...

834
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:51,400
I may not doin 'it?
-No, you stay here.

835

You stupid idiots.

838
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,000
Not so fast.

839
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:26,600
Get your arms out.

840
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,920
Very slowly.
High in the air.

841
01:24:29,119 --> 01:24:31,840
Throw it away.
Come on.

842
01:24:32,039 --> 01:24:33,840

01:24:52,399 --> 01:24:55,360
Only I know where it lies.
-Interesting.

849
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,720
Let me live, then we share it.

850
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:01,480
I do not kill you. I am not dead
unarmed people.

851

No mister, you'll hang.
Hang out.

Old man, I'm afraid

863
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:19,640
He is too smart for us.

01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:38,000
Teach me too 's shooting
without focus.

01:26:38,199 --> 01:26:40,720
Without touching me, of course.

01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:42,280
Blood ...

867
01:26:47,319 --> 01:26:50,400
You okay?
-Am I dead?

868

No idea,
