with his heart
on his sleeve.

his feelings.

their feelings
on all occasions.

Well, thas

privilege.

83

Artists should show
their feelings, too.

And if he's going
to be a painter,

85
00:05:29,854 --> 00:05:31,652
he's got
to feel about things.

86
00:05:31,717 --> 00:05:34,060
Yes. If he felt
that way,

87
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,409
he felt that way.

88
00:05:35,474 --> 00:05:38,235
We'll have to make
the best of our
disappointments.

old... parson.

165
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:17,960
I've learned not
to argue with him.

166
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,369
I can't afford to

167
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,282
if i expect to marry
one of his daughters.

168
00:09:22,347 --> 00:09:25,164
If you're trying
to drink yourself
out of lovesickness,

169
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:26,574
we've got some rum

170
00:09:26,638 --> 00:09:30,449
that will burn the knots
out of a pine plank.

171
00:09:30,514 --> 00:09:31,858
Bring it in.

172
00:09:31,923 --> 00:09:33,810
I wouldn't
drink any more.

173
00:09:33,876 --> 00:09:35,252
Why shouldn't i drink?

174
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:37,301
Browne said all painters
are drunkards.

175
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:39,094
The old hypocrite
wouldn't care

176
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,015
if he thought
they'd be rich.

177
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,417
Money and power...
thas all he
cares about,

178
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,858
hobnobbing
with rich scoundrels

179
00:09:44,923 --> 00:09:47,259
that put poor woodsmen
like hunk in jail.

180
00:09:47,324 --> 00:09:49,180
Hunk got himself
in jail

181
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:51,070
for talking against
wiseman clagett.

182
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:53,504
It was hunk's own fault
for talking.

183
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,386
It was clages fault
for deserving to be
talked against.

184
00:09:56,451 --> 00:09:57,507
Oh, claptrap.

185
00:09:57,572 --> 00:09:58,787
Claptrap?

186
00:09:58,853 --> 00:10:01,510
Wiseman clages
the biggest thief
in this province.

187
00:10:01,574 --> 00:10:02,950
Shh. Not so loud.

188
00:10:03,015 --> 00:10:05,800
Oh, i mustn't talk,
or i'll get put
in jail?

189
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:07,241
I wouldn't
be surprised.

190
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,315
Clagett can steal
100,000 acres of land
from this province,

191
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,556
but nobody
must talk about it.

192
00:10:12,622 --> 00:10:15,439
And he's hand-in-glove
with that indian agent,
sir william johnson.

193
00:10:15,504 --> 00:10:18,161
They let men like hunk
clear the land

194
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:20,082
and risk being scalped
by indians,

195
00:10:20,147 --> 00:10:22,836
then take it away
from them.

196
00:10:22,901 --> 00:10:24,277
Be quiet, langdon.

197
00:10:24,342 --> 00:10:27,062
They'd steal the pennies
off a dead man's eyes,

198
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:28,984
but elizabeth's father
wouldn't care.

199
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:30,873
Well, gentlemen...

200
00:10:33,852 --> 00:10:36,638
to what are we indebted
for this pleasure,
mr. Clagett?

201
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:37,790
Mr. Livermore,

202
00:10:37,856 --> 00:10:40,512
i find you
in dangerous company.

203
00:10:40,577 --> 00:10:41,921
You may withdraw.

204
00:10:41,986 --> 00:10:43,875
Langdon towne
is my guest.

205
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:45,315
If you're here to say
something to him,

206
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,236
say it to me also.

207
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:48,678
You wish
to defend libels

208
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:50,086
against his majesty's
representatives?

209
00:10:50,152 --> 00:10:51,239
Certainly not.

210
00:10:51,304 --> 00:10:53,160
Then you've
no business here.

211
00:10:53,225 --> 00:10:55,081
I bid you
good evening.

212
00:10:55,147 --> 00:10:56,490
Packer, open the door

213
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:59,373
and give mr. Livermore
any necessary
assistance.

214
00:10:59,438 --> 00:11:00,782
Get out!

215
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,970
Now, sir, do you wish
to make a statement?

216
00:11:06,034 --> 00:11:08,018
Why should i make
any statement?

217
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,804
You've made yourself liable
to very dangerous charges.

218
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,246
You've slandered me,

219
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,615
libeled that good man
sir william johnson,

220
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,376
repeated shameful rumors,
lies, calumnies.

221
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:18,681
I'd never
repeat calumnies
about innocent men.

222
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:20,155
Whas that you said?

223
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,012
I don't believe
they're lies.

224
00:11:22,077 --> 00:11:23,197
Langdon, no.

225
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,606
He's dangerously
intoxicated,

226
00:11:24,671 --> 00:11:27,488
a threat to the safety
of the community.

227
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,890
Take him aboard
the battleship
in the harbor.

228
00:11:29,954 --> 00:11:31,363
You can't
shanghai me!

229
00:11:31,427 --> 00:11:34,212
I demand that
word be taken
to my family.

230
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,486
Raving from
the effects of drink.

231
00:11:36,551 --> 00:11:37,606
Raving.

232
00:11:37,672 --> 00:11:40,008
Who's the one raving,
packer or clagett?

233
00:11:40,073 --> 00:11:41,449
Take them both!

234
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:43,371
Langdon, you're
in bad company...

235
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,676
the lowest scoundrels
in portsmouth.

236
00:11:49,424 --> 00:11:50,896
Why, you...

237
00:11:55,283 --> 00:11:57,780
[hunk marriner]
Out the window,
langdon!

238
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:02,071
Take to the woods
and keep going.

239
00:12:02,136 --> 00:12:03,544
Oh, your excellency!

240
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,074
They went that way!
That way!

241
00:12:11,487 --> 00:12:13,984
¶ some talk
of alexander ¶

242

247
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:25,095
see any redcoats?

248
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,465
No, but there's
a fella inside

249
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,457
in some
green outfit.

250
00:12:28,523 --> 00:12:30,859
54's a lot of miles
without no rum.

251
00:12:30,925 --> 00:12:32,332
Shall we risk it?

252
00:12:32,397 --> 00:12:34,285
¶ and such great names

253

00:12:41,298 --> 00:12:42,258
here, you.

258
00:12:42,323 --> 00:12:43,827
Whas the matter?

259
00:12:43,892 --> 00:12:45,813
We ain't busted
no laws.

260
00:12:45,878 --> 00:12:47,478
You can sing,
can't you?

261
00:12:47,543 --> 00:12:48,952
We haven't
got time.

262
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:50,873
No? Why'd you
come in here?

263
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:51,834
Rum.

264
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:53,242
Where you headed for?

265
00:12:53,308 --> 00:12:54,395
West.

266
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,277
Makes no difference
when a man gets west.

267
00:12:57,342 --> 00:12:59,998
Help me get this indian
on his feet,

268
00:13:00,063 --> 00:13:01,408
i'll buy you rum.

269
00:13:01,472 --> 00:13:02,880
This indian
wants to sing.

270
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:04,801
We can't seem
to suit him,

271
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,243
so he's dissatisfied.

272
00:13:06,308 --> 00:13:07,651
Whenever
he's dissatisfied,

273
00:13:07,717 --> 00:13:09,765
he won't drink
anything but rum.

274
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,647
Unless we get him
to drink beer
so he'll get sick,

275
00:13:12,713 --> 00:13:15,498
he won't be fit to travel,
and he's got to travel.

276
00:13:15,563 --> 00:13:16,971
We'll sing some beer
into him.

277
00:13:17,036 --> 00:13:19,661
All right.
Give us the pitch.

278
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:23,214
¶ drink to me only ¶

00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,566
Your sweet what?

296
00:14:20,631 --> 00:14:22,006
Your his sweet brother.

297
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:24,377
Don't worry.
He won't kiss you.

298
00:14:24,441 --> 00:14:27,482
These indians haven't
learned that yet.

299
00:14:29,437 --> 00:14:31,293
He's climbing
a mountain now.

300
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:33,694
When he gets
to the top,

301
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:36,288
he'll fall off
the other side.

302
00:14:38,915 --> 00:14:41,348
There he goes,
into the valley.

303
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:42,821
When he comes to,

304
00:14:42,886 --> 00:14:44,742
he'll be sober enough
to travel.

305
00:14:44,808 --> 00:14:46,183
Gentlemen, i'm obliged.

306
00:14:46,248 --> 00:14:47,624
I need that indian.

307
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:48,745
What for?

308
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:50,346
Bring some hot water,

309
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:51,786
rum, sugar, and butter.

310
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:53,067
Tout suite.

311
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:55,757
I owe these gentlemen
something special
and permanent.

312
00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:57,710
Where'd you say
you're going?

313
00:14:57,775 --> 00:14:59,151
I didn't say,

314
00:14:59,217 --> 00:15:01,041
but we're going
to albany.

315
00:15:01,106 --> 00:15:02,995
You're taking
a roundabout way.

316
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,877
Aren't you afraid
of getting lost
in the woods?

317
00:15:05,942 --> 00:15:08,117
Not with the maps
he makes.

318
00:15:08,183 --> 00:15:09,527
You make maps?

319
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:11,960
You can go anyplace
with his maps.

320
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:14,298
I've always been
interested in maps.

321
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:17,179
Ever since i've been
a little boy, i...

322
00:15:17,245 --> 00:15:19,005
"langdon towne.
Harvard college."

323
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,143
Hmm. Quite an eye
for detail.

324
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,033
Ah. Thank you,
flint.

325
00:15:24,098 --> 00:15:26,434
Cold rum is just
a temporary drink.

326
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,316
Ill wear off
in a day or two,

327
00:15:29,381 --> 00:15:31,718
but hot rum
will last you

328
00:15:31,782 --> 00:15:35,080
as long
as a coonskin cap.

329
00:15:35,145 --> 00:15:38,058
Whas, uh,
whas this map?

330
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:40,779
Oh, thas
the northwest passage.

331
00:15:40,844 --> 00:15:43,917
What do you know about
the northwest passage?

332
00:15:43,983 --> 00:15:44,687
All they know
at harvard.

333
00:15:44,752 --> 00:15:46,320
All they know
at harvard.

334
00:15:46,386 --> 00:15:48,081
Where'd you
hear about it?

335
00:15:48,146 --> 00:15:49,490
Oh, tall tales,

336
00:15:49,555 --> 00:15:51,347
trappers' stories.

337
00:15:52,725 --> 00:15:55,543
Whas a harvard fella
like you aim to do
in albany?

338
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:58,424
We aim to join
dutch traders
and go west.

339
00:15:58,489 --> 00:15:59,609
What for?

340
00:15:59,674 --> 00:16:01,050
Well, paint indians.

341
00:16:01,114 --> 00:16:02,011
Indians?

342
00:16:02,075 --> 00:16:03,099
Paint indians?

343
00:16:03,164 --> 00:16:06,012
As long as we got...
long as we're going,

344
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,247
i could paint them
as they really are.

345
00:16:09,313 --> 00:16:12,802
Smart fella like you...
can make maps,
drink rum.

346
00:16:12,867 --> 00:16:15,652
I'm surprised
you're not in the army.

347
00:16:15,717 --> 00:16:18,694
I'd be
more surprised if i was.

348
00:16:18,758 --> 00:16:21,063
Well, you never
can tell nowadays

349
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:22,824
whall
surprise a man next.

350
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,482
We've got enough sense
not to join the army.

351
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:28,364
We don't aim to dig ditches
and chop down trees

352
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:31,087
and get shot at
in a red coat

353
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:33,969
that stands out
like a house on fire.

354
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:36,370
Might as well
be back in jail.

355
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:37,811
Well, maybe
you're right.

356
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:39,252
Maybe what
you're saying

357
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:41,141
is just plain
common sense.

358
00:16:41,206 --> 00:16:43,575
Anyway, i wouldn't
recommend the british.

359
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:45,944
Maybe those dutch
up in albany

360
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:48,345
might just suit you.

361
00:16:48,411 --> 00:16:50,010
Here's to them.

362
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:55,103
[Gasp]

363
00:16:55,168 --> 00:16:57,473
Makes me want
to shoot a panther.

364
00:16:57,537 --> 00:16:59,426
Two or three
drinks of this,

365
00:16:59,491 --> 00:17:01,828
you won't have to
shoot the panther.

366
00:17:01,892 --> 00:17:04,709
Just walk up to him,
kiss him once,

367
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:08,455
and put him
in your bag,
all limp.

368
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,409
[Snoring]

[Fife and drums
playing]

370
00:17:41,055 --> 00:17:43,551
What the heck
was that?

371
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,185
On your feet.

372
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,138
Come on,
on your feet.

373
00:17:47,203 --> 00:17:49,283
John, take
that shirt off.

374
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:50,436
We're military.

375
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:51,877
Where are we?

376
00:17:51,942 --> 00:17:52,997
Crown point.

377
00:17:53,062 --> 00:17:55,335
Get over
with the scouts.

378
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,161
Kankaba sick indian.

379
00:17:57,226 --> 00:18:00,331
Kankaba so, so sick.

380
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:01,804
Of course you're sick.

381
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:03,725
I've never
seen an indian

382
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,544
need a coat of paint
worse than you do.

383
00:18:06,608 --> 00:18:07,824
Where are my maps?

384
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:10,545
Major rogers took care
of them for you.

385
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:11,826
Major rogers?

386
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:13,940
The indian fighter?

387
00:18:14,005 --> 00:18:15,509
Say,

388
00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:18,359
is he the fella that mixed
that panther juice?

389
00:18:18,424 --> 00:18:21,306
He brought you here
with that indian scout.

390
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,188
That indian got drunk
and went over the hill.

391
00:18:24,252 --> 00:18:26,557
If you let
one indian get away,

392
00:18:26,621 --> 00:18:27,998
they'll all get away.

393
00:18:28,063 --> 00:18:31,008
So major rogers went
after that indian
hisself.

394
00:18:31,072 --> 00:18:32,481
The smartest
indian alive

395
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:35,203
can't think half as much
like an indian

396
00:18:35,267 --> 00:18:36,611
as major rogers can.

397
00:18:36,677 --> 00:18:39,365
We're going to albany,
and i want those maps.

398
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,581
All right.

399
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,810
Come along, and we'll
get them for you.

400
00:18:46,187 --> 00:18:47,979
Rogers thinks
we're drunk enough

401
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:49,932
to join those redcoats,
he's crazy.

402
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:51,822
You mean
them clay dolls?

403
00:18:51,887 --> 00:18:54,256
No. Major rogers
ain't no redcoat.

404
00:18:54,321 --> 00:18:56,625
Haven't you heard
of rogers' rangers?

405
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:59,027
They fight indians mostly,
don't they?

406
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:00,179
Indians? Hah!

407
00:19:00,244 --> 00:19:01,620
They do everything
mostly.

408
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:03,702
Look over there.

409
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,592
Mcneil, where
do you think

410
00:19:05,656 --> 00:19:07,545
major rogers
will take us?

411
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,843
One man's guess is as
good as another's.

412
00:19:10,908 --> 00:19:12,636
Well, here we are.

413
00:19:18,337 --> 00:19:19,681
Wait outside,
sergeant.

414
00:19:19,746 --> 00:19:21,025
Yes, sir.

415
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,515
Good morning, gentlemen.

416
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:27,591
Anything more i can
do for you, command me.

417
00:19:27,655 --> 00:19:30,440
You can return my maps
and sketchbook

418
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:32,490
and explain
why we're here.

419
00:19:32,554 --> 00:19:34,955
I owed you both
a good turn.

420
00:19:35,021 --> 00:19:38,381
Is no good turn
i can make out.

421
00:19:40,272 --> 00:19:42,609
Don't you know
we're fighting a war?

422
00:19:42,673 --> 00:19:44,497
The woods
are full of indians

423
00:19:44,562 --> 00:19:46,291
who'd enjoy
using your hair

424
00:19:46,355 --> 00:19:48,693
to make their girls
look up to them.

425
00:19:48,758 --> 00:19:51,575
I see you've left
a girl at home.

426
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,425
It wouldn't be right
for you to go home
without your hair.

427
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,659
There are no hostile indians
between here and albany.

428
00:19:57,724 --> 00:19:59,068
Well,
suppose there aren't.

429
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:01,437
I need a man
who can make maps.

430
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:02,878
I need him bad.

431
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,800
If you'd join
my rangers

432
00:20:04,864 --> 00:20:07,745
and make a map for me
now and then,

433
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,564
i'd show you
all the indians
you could paint.

434
00:20:10,628 --> 00:20:13,413
Of course, my rangers
are a pretty rough lot,

435
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,815
maybe too rough
for an educated man.

436
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,288
He ain't that educated,

437
00:20:17,353 --> 00:20:19,689
and we can take care
of ourselves.

438
00:20:19,755 --> 00:20:21,579
Then you'll take
to my rangers

439
00:20:21,644 --> 00:20:23,372
like a duck
to water.

440
00:20:23,437 --> 00:20:24,813
They wear
fancy uniforms

441
00:20:24,878 --> 00:20:26,734
and eat like
major generals.

442
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,135
Sometimes there's
quite a spell
between meals,

443
00:20:29,201 --> 00:20:31,378
but that only
whets your appetite.

444
00:20:31,443 --> 00:20:34,260
Now and then
they have to kill
an indian or two.

445
00:20:34,325 --> 00:20:36,661
I want to paint
live indians.

446
00:20:36,726 --> 00:20:39,063
All right. When you
see an indian,

447
00:20:39,128 --> 00:20:41,913
you paint him alive
as long as you
feel safe.

448
00:20:41,977 --> 00:20:43,866
When he gets
too close,

449
00:20:43,931 --> 00:20:45,275
let him have it

450
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,677
and then finish him
with a hatchet.

451
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:50,078
Well, thas just
plain common sense.

452
00:20:50,143 --> 00:20:51,551
We're going out
tonight

453
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:52,991
and in whaleboats.

454
00:20:53,057 --> 00:20:55,874
You won't even
have to walk
to start with,

455
00:20:55,939 --> 00:20:58,660
just a pleasure boat
ride on the lake.

456
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:01,094
You can come along
as mapmaker

457
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,496
in boat number one
with me.

458
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,904
How about it?

459
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,305
Good. We'll endeavor
to teach you things

460
00:21:07,371 --> 00:21:08,970
that harvard college
overlooked.

461
00:21:12,846 --> 00:21:14,382
Your orders, major.

462
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:17,265
I presume
you've planned
your movement.

463
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:21,684
We go up the lake
far as we can
with the boats.

464
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:23,989
The enemy will be
watching the lake,

465
00:21:24,054 --> 00:21:26,871
but we'll row by night
and hide by day.

466
00:21:26,936 --> 00:21:29,721
When we leave the boats,
we'll take our chances.

467
00:21:29,786 --> 00:21:31,354
If we move fast

468
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:33,755
we can do whas
got to be done.

469
00:21:33,821 --> 00:21:35,197
Sir william johnson

470
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,599
thinks you ought
to wait until spring.

471
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,520
General amherst, they
expect me next spring.

472
00:21:39,585 --> 00:21:41,889
Thas why i want
to move now.

473
00:21:41,955 --> 00:21:44,291
As his majesty's
superintendent
of indian affairs,

474
00:21:44,357 --> 00:21:46,117
i speak
with some authority.

475
00:21:46,182 --> 00:21:49,670
In my opinion,
you haven't a chance now.

476
00:21:49,735 --> 00:21:50,887
General amherst,

477
00:21:50,952 --> 00:21:53,769
speaking for my men
and for myself,

478
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:56,107
those red hellions
up there

479
00:21:56,172 --> 00:21:59,662
have come down and hacked
and murdered us,

480
00:21:59,727 --> 00:22:02,063
burned our homes,
stolen women,

481
00:22:02,128 --> 00:22:03,536
brained babies,
scalped stragglers,

482
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:08,308
and roasted officers
over slow fires
for five years.

483
00:22:08,373 --> 00:22:10,517
If you were
in our place,

484
00:22:10,582 --> 00:22:11,958
what would you do?

485
00:22:12,022 --> 00:22:14,359
By jove, i'd go
after them.

486
00:22:14,424 --> 00:22:15,768
Thank you, sir.

487
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,401
Well, then,
inspection.

488
00:22:19,707 --> 00:22:22,526
I've made it appear
the usual thing

489
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,600
in case enemy spies
are watching the fort.

490
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:32,132
Prepare
for inspection!

491
00:22:32,196 --> 00:22:34,373
Present your firearms!

492
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,496
Your scouts seem
anxious enough

493
00:22:39,562 --> 00:22:42,090
to hit the trail.

494
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,100
Where did these mohawks
come from, sir?

495
00:23:07,165 --> 00:23:09,341
Sir william's
offered them as scouts.

496
00:23:09,406 --> 00:23:12,255
Are they scouting for me
or for sir william?

497
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,657
Do you imply
my mohawks
aren't loyal?

498
00:23:14,721 --> 00:23:16,097
They're loyal to you,

499
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:18,467
and you and i
have never agreed

500
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:20,869
upon the best way
to deal with indians.

501
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:23,430
Is crown policy.
Take them along.

502
00:23:23,495 --> 00:23:24,775
Yes, sir.

503
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:28,266
Mr. Ritchie, my compliments
to the command.

504
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:29,803
Dismissed.

505
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:32,877
Dismiss the battalion.

506
00:23:32,942 --> 00:23:35,279
Colors,
right wheel!

507
00:23:35,343 --> 00:23:37,776
Shoulder
your firearms!

508
00:23:40,307 --> 00:23:42,835
To the right,
face!

509
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,781
Forward harch!

510
00:23:45,847 --> 00:23:47,223
Number three company,

511
00:23:47,287 --> 00:23:49,015
to the left, face!

512
00:23:49,081 --> 00:23:52,634
My compliments
to your men, major.

513
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:53,755
Dismissed.

514
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,061
I shall be sorry
to lose them.

515
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,950
We'll be back
in october.

516
00:23:58,015 --> 00:23:59,423
When do you start?

517
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,825
When the last glow
of the sun

518
00:24:01,889 --> 00:24:03,938
has left
the western sky.

519
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:10,310
Rangers.

520
00:24:23,216 --> 00:24:24,592
Number six boat.

521
00:24:24,657 --> 00:24:26,289
Number four boat.

522
00:24:26,354 --> 00:24:27,602
Number six.

523
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:28,563
Number seven.

524
00:24:28,628 --> 00:24:29,651
Number seven.

525
00:24:29,716 --> 00:24:30,868
Come on,
number seven.

526
00:24:30,933 --> 00:24:32,276
Where we going?

527
00:24:32,342 --> 00:24:34,711
Think the major tells
before starting out?

528
00:24:34,776 --> 00:24:36,088
He ain't a fool.

529
00:24:36,153 --> 00:24:37,530
We're in
number one boat.

530
00:24:37,594 --> 00:24:39,643
There it is.
Get in.

531
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:45,598
Take your places, men.

532
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,512
Number 13
filled and ready.

533
00:24:48,577 --> 00:24:50,433
Number 16
filled and ready.

534
00:24:50,498 --> 00:24:52,323
Number 14
filled and ready.

535
00:24:52,388 --> 00:24:54,244
Number 12
filled and ready.

536
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:56,198
Number 10
filled and ready.

537
00:24:56,263 --> 00:24:58,087
Number one
filled and ready.

538
00:24:58,153 --> 00:25:00,040
Anybody dead
in number 17?

539
00:25:00,105 --> 00:25:01,482
Maybe they
aren't going.

540
00:25:01,547 --> 00:25:03,370
Number 17
filled and ready.

541
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,324
All right.
Send them off.

542
00:25:05,389 --> 00:25:07,085
Push off, men.

543
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,686
Up oars, men.

544
00:25:19,158 --> 00:25:20,407
Buttonmould bay.

545
00:25:51,436 --> 00:25:53,004
Turn in here.

546
00:25:54,222 --> 00:25:56,814
Captain, you'll
post sentries
on the ridge.

547
00:25:56,879 --> 00:25:58,255
Four to watch

548
00:25:58,321 --> 00:26:00,177
and two to sleep
by turn.

549
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:02,547
No fires, no cooking,
no smoking.

550
00:26:02,612 --> 00:26:04,820
Have the men
get some sleep.

551
00:26:04,886 --> 00:26:06,773
We won't move
till dark.

552
00:26:34,281 --> 00:26:36,490
Does anyone know
where we're going?

553
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:37,963
Hard to say, son.

554
00:26:38,027 --> 00:26:39,243
Suogataw.

555
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:40,652
Where's that?

556
00:26:40,717 --> 00:26:44,142
Is as good a name
for nowheres as any.

557
00:26:44,207 --> 00:26:46,063
Webster got a letter
yesterday.

558
00:26:46,129 --> 00:26:47,506
His wife died.

559
00:26:47,571 --> 00:26:50,388
He's not feeling
very good.

560
00:26:50,453 --> 00:26:52,789
Oh, thas too bad.

561
00:26:52,854 --> 00:26:55,670
Yes, i suppose a man
does get attached
to a woman

562
00:26:55,736 --> 00:26:58,745
after he's lived with her
a few years.

563
00:27:00,379 --> 00:27:01,723
Where'd you come from?

564
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,259
Portsmouth.

565
00:27:03,325 --> 00:27:06,718
Is funny i never
seen you before.

566
00:27:06,783 --> 00:27:08,961
I was born
in portsmouth.

567
00:27:09,025 --> 00:27:10,849
I been away
to harvard college.

568
00:27:10,915 --> 00:27:11,874
Harvard?

569
00:27:11,939 --> 00:27:14,275
No wonder
you don't
sound right.

570
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,838
How'd you
come to join
the rangers?

571
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:17,990
Wiseman clagett.

572
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:19,495
Who?

573
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,897
That skunk clagett,
you know him?

574
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:25,515
He tried to put me
in jail.

575
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,468
Then when you go home,

576
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:29,870
some of us better
go with you.

577
00:27:29,935 --> 00:27:31,279
If clagett says anything,

578
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:33,457
we'll take his jail
to pieces,

579
00:27:33,522 --> 00:27:35,378
just to give him
the idea.

580
00:27:35,443 --> 00:27:36,851
Yeah.
You say when.

581
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:40,309
These fellas aren't
so bad, after all.

582
00:27:43,545 --> 00:27:45,624
Towne. Major wants you.

583
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,444
Got buzzards bay there?

584
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,239
We'll make it tonight.

585
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:57,281
That isn't
very far, sir.

586
00:27:57,346 --> 00:28:00,291
Better to take your time
going 10 miles
and make it

587
00:28:00,356 --> 00:28:02,660
than it is
trying to go 30

588
00:28:02,725 --> 00:28:05,062
is such a hurry
that you don't.

589
00:28:05,127 --> 00:28:08,104
These frenchmen pop out
of the water like frogs.

590
00:28:12,844 --> 00:28:15,181
Want to paint
some indians?

591
00:28:15,247 --> 00:28:17,583
I don't see
any indians, major.

592
00:28:17,648 --> 00:28:19,280
Then you'd better
keep looking.

593
00:28:19,344 --> 00:28:22,129
If they see you first,
you'll lay where
they leave you.

594
00:28:22,195 --> 00:28:24,211
We don't stop
for funerals.

595
00:28:32,505 --> 00:28:35,322
Just what did they
teach you at harvard

596
00:28:35,387 --> 00:28:37,756
about
a northwest passage?

597
00:28:37,822 --> 00:28:39,646
Why, how
the early explorers

598
00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:42,047
looked for
a shortcut by water

599
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,520
through america
to japan,

600
00:28:43,585 --> 00:28:44,961
but they all failed.

601
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:47,458
Of course. There
is no shortcut.

602
00:28:47,524 --> 00:28:50,373
The only true route
to the western ocean

603
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,870
will be found by men
who break trails

604
00:28:52,935 --> 00:28:54,183
and fight indians.

605
00:28:54,248 --> 00:28:56,969
Thas my aim when
all this is over.

606
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:58,858
There.
Now you can see

607
00:28:58,924 --> 00:29:01,197
what the enemy
looks like.

608
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,392
Are those frenchmen?

609
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:20,986
They look like
toy soldiers.

610
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:23,996
They see our boats,
you'll find out
different.

611
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:33,058
Get down, men.

612
00:29:33,122 --> 00:29:35,459
Keep your fingers
on your triggers.

613
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,925
Don't fire unless
they see us.

614
00:30:01,814 --> 00:30:04,278
Ah-ah-ah...

615
00:30:05,497 --> 00:30:06,905
[muffled sneeze]

616
00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:18,528
Better get some sleep.

617
00:30:18,594 --> 00:30:19,970
Yes, sir.

618
00:30:22,468 --> 00:30:24,325
Don't you
ever sleep?

619
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,469
Uh-huh, sometimes.

620
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:33,259
On your feet.

621
00:30:33,324 --> 00:30:35,116
Come on, men.
Come on.

622
00:30:35,181 --> 00:30:37,037
We're moving out.

623
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:38,927
Muffle your oars
and oarlocks.

624
00:30:38,991 --> 00:30:41,552
Come on, towne,
get up.

625
00:30:41,618 --> 00:30:43,025
On your feet.

626
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,466
Muffle oars
and oarlocks.

627
00:30:44,531 --> 00:30:46,387
Muffle that oar
tight, jesse,

628
00:30:46,452 --> 00:30:48,277
so the leather
doesn't slip.

629
00:30:48,342 --> 00:30:50,166
Can't have
any squeaks
tonight.

630
00:30:50,231 --> 00:30:52,600
We're slipping
by the french,
eh, major?

631
00:30:52,665 --> 00:30:54,041
They're camped
ahead somewheres.

632
00:30:54,106 --> 00:30:55,450
The lake's as narrow

633
00:30:55,515 --> 00:30:57,884
as the neck
of a gin bottle.

634
00:30:57,949 --> 00:31:00,765
We've got to sneak by
without the rattle
of a button.

635
00:31:00,831 --> 00:31:03,006
We mustn't even
hear ourselves breathe.

636
00:31:03,072 --> 00:31:05,408
Put some grease
on that leather.

637
00:31:05,474 --> 00:31:06,529
Yes, major.

638
00:31:06,594 --> 00:31:07,970
Wrap wool around that.

639
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:09,603
Leather against leather
squeaks.

640
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,248
We can
breathe easy now.

641
00:31:41,081 --> 00:31:42,490
We're safe.

642
00:31:42,554 --> 00:31:43,899
Safe?

643
00:31:43,963 --> 00:31:44,891
Yeah.

644
00:31:44,956 --> 00:31:47,004

I don't know.

There were frenchmen

we passed last night.

662

There must be more frenchmen
ahead of us.

just went out to
take a good sleep.

We can move

and you had to
get around him

and you were going to need
your boats again bad,

693
00:34:22,631 --> 00:34:24,359
what would you do?

694
00:34:27,082 --> 00:34:30,380

the boats with me
over that hill.

Keep a report of this,

as great warriors.

00:38:16,007 --> 00:38:17,415
They've come
a long journey

713
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:19,976
from their homes
in the mohawk valley,

714
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:21,385
and we, their friends,

thought they had come
to raise their hatchets

716

for the great king
their father.

We trusted them to find
the french's hiding place.

718
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,255
They returned saying
they'd seen nothing,

719
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:32,688
yet three french war boats
were in the way,

720
00:38:32,754 --> 00:38:34,130
enough to kill us all.

understand
there is time
make war

and time
not make war.

728

This is not time
make war.

Ohh.

00:38:58,947 --> 00:39:01,284
Well, now we understand
why sir william johnson

731
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:03,686
sent our brothers
the mohawks to join us.

732
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,087
He sent them
to drink our rum,

733
00:39:06,152 --> 00:39:07,560
eat our food,
and do nothing.

734
00:39:07,626 --> 00:39:09,417
Since they won't
obey orders,

735
00:39:09,482 --> 00:39:11,338
they must return
to crown point.

736
00:39:11,404 --> 00:39:13,644
If they tell the real reason
they came back,

737
00:39:13,709 --> 00:39:16,045
general amherst
might have them shot,

738
00:39:16,111 --> 00:39:17,999
so they'll say
they became sick.

739
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:20,401
It may seem remarkable
that all of the mohawks

740
00:39:20,467 --> 00:39:21,682
became sick.

741
00:39:21,747 --> 00:39:24,084
They may be called old women
for doing so.

742
00:39:24,149 --> 00:39:26,036
Better to be called
old women

743
00:39:26,102 --> 00:39:27,094
than to be shot.

744
00:39:27,158 --> 00:39:29,527
They will return at once
by land.

745
00:39:29,592 --> 00:39:30,456

746

half as good
as a weasel,

749
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:43,105
they'd be

maintain discipline.

discipline's gone,
everything's gone.

captain butterfield,
you're going back.

788
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:07,738
Report to general amherst
that you got sick, too.

789
00:41:07,804 --> 00:41:11,100
You're sick,
and so is every man
with a powder burn

790
00:41:11,165 --> 00:41:13,342
who goes back
with you.

791
00:41:13,407 --> 00:41:14,783

792
00:41:18,819 --> 00:41:22,627
captain williams,
i'm putting you in charge
of all these sick men.

793
00:41:22,693 --> 00:41:24,037
You'll start
back at once.

794
00:41:24,101 --> 00:41:26,470
Major, i'd like
to say a word.

795
00:41:26,535 --> 00:41:27,430
Say it.

796
00:41:27,496 --> 00:41:28,840
Counting the mohawks,

797
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,794
you're sending back
40 men.

798
00:41:30,859 --> 00:41:32,684
Thas 20%
of your command.

799
00:41:32,748 --> 00:41:35,085
You can't afford
to lose that many,
major.

800
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,077
Couldn't you...

801
00:41:36,142 --> 00:41:37,487
reconsider
those orders?

802
00:41:37,551 --> 00:41:40,368
I can still see
out of one eye.

803
00:41:40,433 --> 00:41:41,809
Captain williams,
you're going back

804
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,722
because you're in
no condition to go on,

805
00:41:44,788 --> 00:41:47,124
but most of you
are going back

806
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:49,014
because you can't
maintain discipline.

807
00:41:49,078 --> 00:41:51,416
I'd make this expedition
with 50 men.

808
00:41:51,481 --> 00:41:52,889
Yes, with 10 men.

809
00:41:52,954 --> 00:41:54,810
I'd do more
with those 10

810
00:41:54,876 --> 00:41:57,660
than i could with 200
who didn't obey orders.

811
00:41:57,725 --> 00:42:00,061
All the men
in this detachment
are rangers.

812
00:42:00,127 --> 00:42:01,535
Do you understand?

813
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,416
They're not englishmen
or highlanders or irishmen.

814
00:42:04,482 --> 00:42:05,377
They're rangers.

815
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:07,715
And if i find
two men leading together

816
00:42:07,779 --> 00:42:09,123
as americans or englishmen,

817
00:42:09,189 --> 00:42:11,076
by heavens,
i'll send them back

818
00:42:11,142 --> 00:42:13,479
if we're within 20 feet
of where we're going.

819
00:42:13,544 --> 00:42:14,407
Dismissed.

820
00:42:14,473 --> 00:42:15,880
Injured men
fall in there.

821
00:42:15,946 --> 00:42:18,282
The rest of us
will push on.

822
00:42:18,347 --> 00:42:21,164
We can't risk
being bottled up
in a little stream.

823
00:42:21,228 --> 00:42:22,125
Fall in!

824
00:42:22,189 --> 00:42:24,238
Follow me to the boats!

825
00:43:01,257 --> 00:43:02,568
Any orders, sir?

826
00:43:02,634 --> 00:43:04,490
Have them
cover the boats well.

827
00:43:04,555 --> 00:43:05,610
Yes, sir.

828
00:43:07,116 --> 00:43:08,172
Well, captain,

829
00:43:08,237 --> 00:43:11,534
this is as far as we can go
with the boats.

830
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,935
Have every man
fill his meal bag.

831
00:43:14,001 --> 00:43:16,817
Assemble all ranks
at the base of split rock

832
00:43:16,883 --> 00:43:18,259
in full marching kit.

833
00:43:18,323 --> 00:43:19,379
Very good, sir.

834
00:43:19,444 --> 00:43:20,533
Captain jacobs, kankaba.

835
00:43:33,214 --> 00:43:35,006
Men, you've followed me
faithfully

836
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:36,447
and without questions,

837
00:43:36,512 --> 00:43:37,887
and i appreciate it.

838
00:43:37,953 --> 00:43:39,809
Now the time has come

839
00:43:39,874 --> 00:43:42,212
for you to know
where we're going,

840
00:43:42,277 --> 00:43:45,285
although some of you
probably have already guessed.

841
00:43:47,303 --> 00:43:48,680
Here's general amherst

842
00:43:48,745 --> 00:43:50,633
and our forces
at crown point.

843
00:43:50,698 --> 00:43:53,035
Here's lake champlain
and missisquoi bay

844
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:54,443
where we are now.

845
00:43:54,509 --> 00:43:57,325
Up here is
the st. Lawrence river

846
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:58,286
and canada.

847
00:43:58,351 --> 00:43:59,694
And right there

848
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,064
is the spot
we're headed for...

849
00:44:02,129 --> 00:44:04,050
the abanochi indians
at st. Francis.

850
00:44:04,116 --> 00:44:06,964
Thas where
we wanted to go, major.

851
00:44:07,029 --> 00:44:09,846
I don't have to tell you
who the abanochis are.

852
00:44:09,911 --> 00:44:12,215
Most of you have lost
folks and friends

853
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,136
in indian raids
since '57.

854
00:44:14,202 --> 00:44:16,570
You'll find their scalps
at st. Francis.

855
00:44:16,635 --> 00:44:18,972
Some of you men
fought in the battle

856
00:44:19,036 --> 00:44:20,348
on snowshoes last year.

857
00:44:20,413 --> 00:44:21,789
Ask joe turner.

858
00:44:21,855 --> 00:44:23,711
He was there.
He'll tell you.

859
00:44:23,776 --> 00:44:25,600
They captured lieutenants
crofton and phillips

860
00:44:25,665 --> 00:44:27,073
and 20 other rangers.

861
00:44:27,139 --> 00:44:28,483
Lieutenant crofton's
brother is here.

862
00:44:28,547 --> 00:44:31,365
He can tell you
what happened to them.

863
00:44:31,429 --> 00:44:32,357
Yes, major.

864
00:44:32,422 --> 00:44:34,054
I can tell you.

865
00:44:35,561 --> 00:44:37,416
Phillips had
a strip of skin

866
00:44:37,482 --> 00:44:38,857
torn upward
from his stomach.

867
00:44:38,922 --> 00:44:41,643
They hung him
from a tree
while still alive.

868
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:44,045
They chopped his men up
with hatchets

869
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:46,798
and threw the pieces
into the pine.

870
00:44:46,863 --> 00:44:49,201
They tore
my brother's arms
out of him.

871
00:44:49,266 --> 00:44:52,563
They chopped
the ends of his ribs
away from his backbone

872
00:44:52,628 --> 00:44:56,565
and pried them
out through his skin
one by one.

873
00:44:56,631 --> 00:44:58,935
Thas what happened
to crofton and phillips.

874
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,476
But they were soldiers.
Tey had to take their chances.

875
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,201
But your folks
on the border farms,

876
00:45:04,266 --> 00:45:05,512
they weren't
fighting anybody.

877
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,399
They were clearing woods
and plowing

878
00:45:07,464 --> 00:45:08,870
and raising children,

879
00:45:08,935 --> 00:45:11,236
trying to make
a home of it.

880
00:45:11,301 --> 00:45:12,707
And then one night,

881
00:45:12,772 --> 00:45:15,297
abanochi tomahawks
at the door.

882
00:45:15,361 --> 00:45:18,334
If it was over quick,
they were lucky.

883
00:45:19,263 --> 00:45:21,053
Now, if there's
any man here

884
00:45:21,117 --> 00:45:22,971
who doesn't want
to follow me

885
00:45:23,036 --> 00:45:24,378
against these indians,

886
00:45:24,442 --> 00:45:26,488
he can step out now.

887
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:30,165
Destroy that map.

888
00:45:30,231 --> 00:45:33,012
We'll leave provisions here
for our return.

889
00:45:33,076 --> 00:45:35,442
Take two indians
and watch the boats.

890
00:45:35,506 --> 00:45:38,320
If the french find them,
notify me quickly.

891
00:45:38,384 --> 00:45:40,717
Well, men, you won't have
any boats to row,

892
00:45:40,783 --> 00:45:43,116
and you won't have any time
to sit down.

893
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:45,035
You won't be bothered
with blisters

894
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:46,953
where you got them now.

895
00:45:47,017 --> 00:45:48,392
We're going
through the swamps

896
00:45:48,457 --> 00:45:50,758
so we won't leave
any tracks.

897
00:45:50,823 --> 00:45:51,750
Number one squad!

898
00:45:51,814 --> 00:45:53,635
Till we're out
of the bog,

899
00:45:53,701 --> 00:45:55,042
we'll march three abreast.

900
00:45:55,107 --> 00:45:56,929
Straighten that line!

901
00:45:56,994 --> 00:45:59,359
We'll stop every hour
to save straggling.

902
00:45:59,425 --> 00:46:01,245
We can't afford
to lose anybody

903
00:46:01,311 --> 00:46:02,716
on this trip.

904
00:46:02,782 --> 00:46:03,644
All set?

905
00:46:03,709 --> 00:46:04,635
Yeah!
Yeah!

906
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,787
Forward!

907
00:46:39,074 --> 00:46:41,087
We'll go north
all afternoon.

908
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:45,436
Should strike some
shallow water by evening.

909
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:56,372
Mosquitoes
don't bite you,
do they?

910
00:46:56,437 --> 00:46:57,332
Nope.

911
00:46:57,396 --> 00:47:00,209
You put something on
to keep them off?

912
00:47:00,274 --> 00:47:01,616
Rancid bear's grease.

913
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,717
They hate the stink
worse than i do.

914
00:47:09,036 --> 00:47:09,930
Thanks.

915
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:11,561
I'll keep
the mosquitoes.

916
00:47:27,901 --> 00:47:30,522
Get off that dry land.

917
00:47:30,587 --> 00:47:31,737
No tracks.

918
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:43,984
Where does he get
that energy?

919
00:47:44,048 --> 00:47:46,894
Don't you wish
you were like him?

920
00:47:46,959 --> 00:47:47,853
Heck no.

921
00:47:47,918 --> 00:47:49,963
I'd rather
be like me.

922
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:30,092
Captain ogden?

923
00:48:32,045 --> 00:48:33,290
Captain ogden.

924
00:48:36,681 --> 00:48:38,726
Travel north
by northeast today.

925
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:43,970
I don't see any reason to
dillydally here any longer.

926
00:48:44,035 --> 00:48:45,409
Very good, sir.

927
00:48:45,474 --> 00:48:48,863
Tell the men
we'll eat breakfast
on the move.

928
00:48:50,334 --> 00:48:51,229
Come on.

929
00:48:51,293 --> 00:48:52,667
Hit the trail.

930
00:48:52,733 --> 00:48:54,234
We'll eat
on the march.

931
00:48:54,299 --> 00:48:55,897
Come on, men.

932
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:58,647
Ohh.

933
00:49:01,398 --> 00:49:03,731
I've slept in
a lot of worse places,

934
00:49:03,796 --> 00:49:05,171
but right now,

935
00:49:05,235 --> 00:49:08,207
i can't recall
just where they was.

936
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:14,443
All right, men!
On your feet!

937
00:49:14,508 --> 00:49:16,585
Get that column formed!

938
00:49:40,216 --> 00:49:42,102
Come on.
Keep moving, men.

939
00:49:42,167 --> 00:49:44,916
Too bad this bog
isn't rum and eggnog.

940
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:47,986
We'd all be mellow
as horse apples.

941
00:49:51,376 --> 00:49:53,230
Here.
Save that stuff, man.

942
00:49:53,294 --> 00:49:55,628
Learn to keep going
on a mouthful a day.

943
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:57,034
Yes, sir, major.

944
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,218
Keep going.

945
00:50:03,207 --> 00:50:05,349
Break your leg,
webster?

946
00:50:05,413 --> 00:50:07,171
Yeah, in two places.

947
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:10,081
Rest here a while?

948
00:50:10,146 --> 00:50:11,488
Thought i would.

949
00:50:11,553 --> 00:50:13,854
Well, you'll want
some tobacco.

950
00:50:15,677 --> 00:50:17,308
Won't need all that,
major.

951
00:50:17,372 --> 00:50:19,226
Oh, you better
keep it, anyway.

952
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:20,697
Good luck, webster.

953
00:50:20,761 --> 00:50:23,095
Get a redskin for me,
won't you?

954
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,534
Better than that, major.

955
00:50:24,598 --> 00:50:26,453
I've got her loaded
with buckshot.

956
00:50:26,517 --> 00:50:28,051
That's the spirit,
webster.

957
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:37,068
You can't
leave a man behind
like this.

958
00:50:38,572 --> 00:50:39,946
Webster knew
what would happen

959
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:41,417
if he couldn't
keep up.

960
00:50:41,482 --> 00:50:44,230
And he understands
that you'd like
to help him, too,

961
00:50:44,296 --> 00:50:45,670
that we all would.

962
00:50:45,735 --> 00:50:48,548
He understands the same
as i would myself.

963
00:50:48,613 --> 00:50:49,507
Keep going.

964
00:50:49,572 --> 00:50:51,138
Keep going, men.

965
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:21,866
We'll rest here
a while.

966
00:51:21,931 --> 00:51:23,976
I've sent jacobs
on ahead.

967
00:51:25,288 --> 00:51:28,613
Should be near
the st. Francis river.

968
00:51:28,678 --> 00:51:30,691
Have the men fall out.

969
00:51:30,756 --> 00:51:32,131
Fall out, men!

970
00:51:32,195 --> 00:51:33,761
Fall out!
Fall out!

971
00:51:49,238 --> 00:51:52,051
Ain't you sick of
sausage and cornmeal?

972
00:51:52,116 --> 00:51:53,618
No, can't say i am,

973
00:51:53,683 --> 00:51:55,569
seeing this is
all we got.

974
00:51:55,633 --> 00:51:58,447
Now, if i had been led
to expect roast turkey,

975
00:51:58,511 --> 00:52:00,845
i'd be sick of
sausage and cornmeal,

976
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,083
but not otherwise.

977
00:52:03,147 --> 00:52:04,010
[Splash]

978
00:52:04,075 --> 00:52:04,969
Major!

979
00:52:05,034 --> 00:52:06,504
Major rogers!

980
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:08,135
Kankaba!

981
00:52:12,261 --> 00:52:13,155
Major!

982
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,114
The boats!

983
00:52:14,179 --> 00:52:15,074
The boats!

984
00:52:15,139 --> 00:52:16,513
What about the boats?

985
00:52:16,577 --> 00:52:18,111
The french
found our boats!

986
00:52:19,423 --> 00:52:20,350
Quiet.

987
00:52:20,414 --> 00:52:21,757
Captain ogden,
wait a minute.

988
00:52:21,822 --> 00:52:23,228
This concerns
all of us.

989
00:52:23,292 --> 00:52:24,666
When did
it happen?

990
00:52:24,731 --> 00:52:26,106
Sundown,
three suns ago.

991
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:28,024
How many french
and indians?

992
00:52:28,088 --> 00:52:28,984
Maybe 500.

993
00:52:29,048 --> 00:52:30,614
500? 500?
500? 500?

994
00:52:39,504 --> 00:52:41,837
Well, men, the french think
they've trapped us.

995
00:52:41,903 --> 00:52:43,788
They think
they've cut us off

996
00:52:43,853 --> 00:52:46,186
and that this is the end
of rogers' rangers.

997
00:52:46,251 --> 00:52:49,064
They've been trying
for five years
to wipe us out.

998
00:52:49,129 --> 00:52:51,462
Now they think
they'll have our scalps.

999
00:52:51,527 --> 00:52:52,869
They're probably
counting the money.

1000
00:52:52,934 --> 00:52:55,299
1,000 pounds
for my head alone.

1001
00:52:55,364 --> 00:52:57,985
They want us pretty bad,
the french do.

1002
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,895
Want to know how i feel,
i'll tell you.

1003
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,293
We've always done things
they thought were impossible,

1004
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:06,171
and i don't propose
to stop now.

1005
00:53:06,236 --> 00:53:07,259
No!
No!

1006
00:53:07,323 --> 00:53:08,729
They think they've got us.

1007
00:53:08,794 --> 00:53:11,127
They think
we're as good as dead.

1008
00:53:11,192 --> 00:53:13,525
They haven't got me,
and they haven't got you.

1009
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:14,964
Not yet, they haven't.

1010
00:53:15,029 --> 00:53:16,883
I don't think
they ever will,

1011
00:53:16,948 --> 00:53:21,167
if we continue to fight
as we have in the past.

1012
00:53:21,233 --> 00:53:22,638
Get out your maps.

1013
00:53:22,704 --> 00:53:23,598
Yes, sir.

1014
00:53:23,663 --> 00:53:24,749
Lieutenant mcmullen...

1015
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,013
that's a bad knee,
lieutenant.

1016
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:36,452
You'll never make it.

1017
00:53:36,517 --> 00:53:38,850
There's
nothing the matter
with my knee.

1018
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:40,289
Good.

1019
00:53:40,354 --> 00:53:43,039
I'm sending you
back to crown point
with a message.

1020
00:53:43,104 --> 00:53:45,533
Remember this map
is a big inverted "v."

1021
00:53:45,598 --> 00:53:47,484
We're going up
to st. Francis.

1022
00:53:47,549 --> 00:53:49,626
Then we'll start down
past lake memphremagog.

1023
00:53:49,691 --> 00:53:52,280
Tell general amherst
to send food for 150 men

1024
00:53:52,345 --> 00:53:53,751
to old fort wentworth

1025
00:53:53,815 --> 00:53:56,117
or where it was
if it's fallen down.

1026
00:53:56,182 --> 00:53:57,556
Circle around the french,

1027
00:53:57,621 --> 00:54:00,913
even if you have to make
a 50-mile detour.

1028
00:54:00,979 --> 00:54:02,320
They'll be following us.

1029
00:54:02,385 --> 00:54:04,270
Take keely and wilson
with you.

1030
00:54:04,336 --> 00:54:06,189
They're too sick
to go on.

1031
00:54:06,254 --> 00:54:09,067
Don't tell them the message
unless you have to.

1032
00:54:09,132 --> 00:54:10,985
If the french take you,

1033
00:54:11,051 --> 00:54:13,863
don't let them know
how we plan to get back

1034
00:54:13,928 --> 00:54:15,303
no matter what they do.

1035
00:54:15,368 --> 00:54:16,709
You've got to get through.

1036
00:54:16,775 --> 00:54:19,619
Provisions for 150 men
at fort wentworth.

1037
00:54:19,684 --> 00:54:21,506
You're coming back
the eastern leg

1038
00:54:21,571 --> 00:54:22,977
past lake memphremagog.

1039
00:54:23,042 --> 00:54:23,903
That's right.

1040
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,855
That's how
we'll come back

1041
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,709
if we come back.

1042
00:54:27,774 --> 00:54:29,596
Good luck.

1043
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:30,587
Goodbye, major.

1044
00:54:30,652 --> 00:54:32,505
Keely! Wilson!

1045
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,615
We're moving!

1046
00:54:35,416 --> 00:54:36,822
Big river.

1047
00:54:36,887 --> 00:54:38,741
That'll be
the st. Francis.

1048
00:54:38,805 --> 00:54:41,619
Tell captain ogden
to have the men fall in.

1049
00:54:41,683 --> 00:54:43,057
We'll cross at once.

1050
00:54:43,122 --> 00:54:44,177
Yes, sir.

1051
00:54:47,439 --> 00:54:48,813
Forward, men!

1052
00:54:48,878 --> 00:54:50,348
Forward!

1053
00:55:19,446 --> 00:55:22,387
We ought to be about
15 miles above town.

1054
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:24,722
How many rafts
shall we make, sir?

1055
00:55:24,787 --> 00:55:26,640
We got no time
for rafts.

1056
00:55:26,705 --> 00:55:28,559
Have the men
plug their muskets.

1057
00:55:28,624 --> 00:55:29,966
We'll wade it.

1058
00:55:30,031 --> 00:55:31,916
How can we wade that?

1059
00:55:31,981 --> 00:55:32,843
Well...

1060
00:55:32,909 --> 00:55:34,314
you could,
couldn't you,

1061
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,712
if you had
a good stout chain

1062
00:55:36,777 --> 00:55:38,631
stretched across
to hang on to?

1063
00:55:38,696 --> 00:55:41,061
Sure, major,
but we ain't got
no chain.

1064
00:55:41,126 --> 00:55:42,468
Well,
we'll make one.

1065
00:55:42,533 --> 00:55:45,346
We'll make
a human chain,
man by man.

1066
00:55:45,411 --> 00:55:48,223
I don't know
that it's ever
been done before,

1067
00:55:48,289 --> 00:55:51,101
but that's no reason
why it can't be.

1068
00:55:51,166 --> 00:55:53,020
I'll see
what it's like.

1069
00:55:53,085 --> 00:55:54,938
Now, ain't he a caution?

1070
00:55:55,003 --> 00:55:56,857
We ferry boats
over a hill

1071
00:55:56,922 --> 00:55:58,265
where a panther
couldn't crawl.

1072
00:55:58,329 --> 00:56:00,662
Now we make a chain
across a river

1073
00:56:00,727 --> 00:56:02,677
where a fish
couldn't swim.

1074
00:56:15,148 --> 00:56:16,042
All right.

1075
00:56:16,107 --> 00:56:17,961
Take your indians
downstream.

1076
00:56:18,026 --> 00:56:20,328
If anybody drowns,
get them.

1077
00:56:20,392 --> 00:56:21,798
Can't have any bodies

1078
00:56:21,863 --> 00:56:24,804
floating down
the st. Francis
to give warning.

1079
00:56:30,049 --> 00:56:31,327
Ogden!
Yes, sir!

1080
00:56:31,392 --> 00:56:32,894
Pick your best men.

1081
00:56:38,587 --> 00:56:40,313
Come on, men!

1082
00:56:40,377 --> 00:56:42,038
Grab a hand!

1083
00:56:56,749 --> 00:57:00,137
Take a good hold, men.
Now, don't let go.

1084
00:58:00,796 --> 00:58:02,202
How about you, towne?

1085
00:58:02,266 --> 00:58:05,272
Do you feel husky enough
to be the first man over?

1086
00:58:05,337 --> 00:58:06,903
Yes, sir.

1087
00:58:10,133 --> 00:58:12,434
When you get
on the other side,

1088
00:58:12,499 --> 00:58:14,864
get out your notebook
and keep count.

1089
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:30,340
Yes, sir.

1090
00:58:31,621 --> 00:58:33,986
Keep your feet, men!

1091
00:59:25,115 --> 00:59:27,609
Get that man!

1092
00:59:43,183 --> 00:59:45,259
Fill it in, men!
Fill in that break!

1093
01:00:00,481 --> 01:00:02,303
Come on.
We got to keep moving.

1094
01:00:02,368 --> 01:00:03,741
It's boyle. He's sick.

1095
01:00:03,806 --> 01:00:05,532
I'll go and get him.

1096
01:00:05,597 --> 01:00:07,259
Stay where you are.

1097
01:00:07,323 --> 01:00:09,178
We'll have to leave him.

1098
01:00:09,242 --> 01:00:11,288
Boyle, keep traveling east,

1099
01:00:11,353 --> 01:00:13,941
try to keep out of
the way of the french.

1100
01:00:14,007 --> 01:00:16,404
They'll be following us.

1101
01:00:16,469 --> 01:00:17,459
Good luck!

1102
01:00:17,524 --> 01:00:19,345
Come on, avery.

1103
01:00:19,411 --> 01:00:21,072
We've got to keep moving.

1104
01:00:27,565 --> 01:00:28,971
When you get across,

1105
01:00:29,035 --> 01:00:31,560
tell the men
to pull us over.

1106
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:25,183
Well done, major.

1107
01:01:25,249 --> 01:01:26,463
Well done, major.

1108
01:01:26,528 --> 01:01:27,901
Nice work,
major.

1109
01:01:27,966 --> 01:01:29,820
Shall we bury
the dead, sir?

1110
01:01:29,885 --> 01:01:32,698
No time for funerals.
Hide them in the bushes.

1111
01:01:32,763 --> 01:01:33,657
Yes, sir.

1112
01:01:33,722 --> 01:01:35,575
What do you make of it?

1113
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,494
142... 5 are
without muskets.

1114
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:38,902
Not bad.
Could be worse.

1115
01:01:38,966 --> 01:01:41,811
I could take quebec
with 142 men like these.

1116
01:01:41,876 --> 01:01:44,689
Now draw your loads
and reload with buckshot.

1117
01:01:44,754 --> 01:01:46,607
We're heading
for st. Francis.

1118

[Shouting]

1119
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:55,497
Forward, march!

Let's see now.

1123
01:02:28,336 --> 01:02:30,191
Bayonet...

1124
01:02:30,255 --> 01:02:32,557

01:02:34,572 --> 01:02:36,905
hatchet, and...

1127
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:40,039
i've been saving this here

can't smell us.

Lucky thing
for the dogs.

1160
01:04:24,601 --> 01:04:26,166
We're to
wipe out this town,

Don't kill
our own indians
or the white captives.

1164

going to do.

to escape this way.

the river road
above the village.

was so well-trained

that it kept
firing and reloading
all by itself.

1288
01:17:17,229 --> 01:17:19,562
Tell them if they ever
send their warriors

1289
01:17:19,627 --> 01:17:21,481
to take the scalps
of our people,

1290
01:17:21,546 --> 01:17:23,176
i'll have no mercy
next time.

1291
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,798
[Speaking mohawk]

1292
01:17:25,862 --> 01:17:27,172
We attacked at 5:17.

1293
01:17:27,237 --> 01:17:29,571
It's 6:10 now,
and we're still here.

1294
01:17:29,636 --> 01:17:31,968
Assemble the men.
We've got to get moving.

1295
01:17:32,034 --> 01:17:33,887
Where's towne?
Have you seen towne?

1296
01:17:33,952 --> 01:17:35,806
Langdon towne!

1297
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:38,204
Take two men
and burn the fort.

1298
01:17:38,269 --> 01:17:39,643
Slim!

1299
01:17:39,708 --> 01:17:41,561
You can't use
all those moccasins.

1300
01:17:41,626 --> 01:17:43,704
I'll keep them
for you.

1301
01:17:43,769 --> 01:17:45,462
Langdon!

1302
01:17:45,528 --> 01:17:47,125
Langdon!

1303
01:17:48,981 --> 01:17:51,347
Crofton, have you
seen langdon towne?

1304
01:17:51,411 --> 01:17:52,753
No!

1305
01:18:00,333 --> 01:18:01,994
Langdon!

1306
01:18:02,059 --> 01:18:03,977
Langdon!

1307
01:18:10,404 --> 01:18:12,962
Langdon.

1308
01:18:13,026 --> 01:18:15,616
I let him
see me first.

1309
01:18:15,681 --> 01:18:17,982
How does it feel, son?

1310
01:18:18,047 --> 01:18:20,381
Well, sort of like...

1311
01:18:20,445 --> 01:18:23,610
i spilled
hot soup on myself.

1312
01:18:27,128 --> 01:18:28,981
We got to travel.

1313
01:18:29,047 --> 01:18:30,484
Come on.

1314
01:18:30,549 --> 01:18:32,787
Ow!

1315
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:40,205
Put your weight
on me now.

1316
01:18:44,491 --> 01:18:47,879
We won't say
nothing to the major
about this.

1317
01:18:49,959 --> 01:18:51,333
Come in here!

1318
01:18:51,397 --> 01:18:54,594
All right!
Get them in the boats!

1319
01:18:58,848 --> 01:19:01,117
We're ready
to go, major.

1320
01:19:01,182 --> 01:19:03,515
Don't any of
these red hellions

1321
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:04,955
have man-sized feet?

1322
01:19:05,019 --> 01:19:06,393
Lieutenant avery!

1323
01:19:06,458 --> 01:19:07,832
Captain ogden!

1324
01:19:07,897 --> 01:19:10,486
All right.
Shove off.

1325
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:17,425
When we get
on the other side,

1326
01:19:17,489 --> 01:19:19,823
i'll build
a stretcher for you.

1327
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:22,989
Be careful of him.
He's pretty bad wounded.

1328
01:19:24,077 --> 01:19:26,666
I'll be
right behind you,
langdon.

1329
01:19:41,887 --> 01:19:44,220
Assemble all the men
over here.

1330
01:19:44,286 --> 01:19:45,627
Line them up,
sergeant.

1331
01:19:45,692 --> 01:19:47,098
Here we go.

1332
01:19:47,163 --> 01:19:48,026
Line up!

1333
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:49,017
Captain's orders!

1334
01:19:49,082 --> 01:19:49,976
Over here!

1335
01:19:50,041 --> 01:19:53,110
[Shouting]

1336
01:19:53,175 --> 01:19:55,444
Get out of the water!
Out of those canoes!

1337
01:19:55,508 --> 01:19:56,403
Out! Out!

1338
01:19:56,468 --> 01:19:58,002
Out of those canoes!

1339
01:20:06,828 --> 01:20:08,171
Hurry up, men.

1340
01:20:08,235 --> 01:20:10,121
Join your companies
and report at once.

1341
01:20:10,186 --> 01:20:11,656
Assemble over here.

1342
01:20:20,674 --> 01:20:22,527
How many men missing?

1343
01:20:22,592 --> 01:20:23,486
Seven, sir.

1344
01:20:23,551 --> 01:20:25,117
Two.

1345
01:20:25,183 --> 01:20:26,108
Three, sir.

1346
01:20:26,173 --> 01:20:27,068
Four.

1347
01:20:27,133 --> 01:20:28,283
16.

1348
01:20:28,348 --> 01:20:29,722
It might be worse.

1349
01:20:29,787 --> 01:20:31,321
Towne's wounded.

1350
01:20:31,386 --> 01:20:34,038
He's lying there, sir.

1351
01:20:39,476 --> 01:20:41,233
Now pay attention.

1352
01:20:41,298 --> 01:20:44,111
Pretty soon
there'll be 500 frenchmen
and indians back here

1353
01:20:44,176 --> 01:20:46,925
looking for
their silverware
and sunday britches.

1354
01:20:46,990 --> 01:20:48,427
[Laughter]

1355
01:20:48,493 --> 01:20:50,314
We've got to
keep ahead of them,

1356
01:20:50,379 --> 01:20:52,745
and we've got
to get to food.

1357
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:55,622
How do you aim
to get us back, major?

1358
01:20:55,688 --> 01:20:57,541
Go any way
but that swamp again.

1359
01:20:57,606 --> 01:20:59,939
Then we'll strike out
for lake memphremagog.

1360
01:21:00,004 --> 01:21:01,986
Then we'll go
to old fort wentworth
and food.

1361
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:04,863
Did you say food?
How far is it, major?

1362
01:21:04,928 --> 01:21:08,572
We ought to be able
to step into the lake
in 10 days.

1363
01:21:08,637 --> 01:21:11,418
You can
rest your stomachs
all the way.

1364
01:21:11,483 --> 01:21:15,287
When we get there,
maybe we can stop
to hunt and fish.

1365
01:21:15,352 --> 01:21:17,142
Salmon, trout,
and deer steaks.

1366
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:19,061
Will that suit everybody?

1367
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:20,020
Oh, yeah.

1368
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:21,939
All right.
Before we start,

1369
01:21:22,003 --> 01:21:24,336
every man eat
a handful of corn.

1370
01:21:24,401 --> 01:21:25,776
That's a banquet.

1371
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:29,357
What do you think
the french will eat
at st. Francis?

1372
01:21:29,421 --> 01:21:32,170
Nothing but roast indians.

1373
01:21:32,236 --> 01:21:34,409
All right, ogden!
Start them south!

1374
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:36,328
Right...

1375
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:37,766
face!

1376
01:21:37,831 --> 01:21:39,205
Right face!

1377
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:40,644
Right face!

1378
01:21:40,709 --> 01:21:41,572
Right face!

1379
01:21:41,636 --> 01:21:42,883
Forward!

1380
01:21:42,947 --> 01:21:43,809
Forward!

1381
01:21:43,874 --> 01:21:44,801
Forward!

1382
01:21:44,865 --> 01:21:45,760
Forward!

1383
01:21:45,825 --> 01:21:46,943
March!

1384
01:21:48,223 --> 01:21:49,597
Didn't you
hear assembly?

1385
01:21:49,662 --> 01:21:51,036
Join your company,
marriner.

1386
01:21:51,101 --> 01:21:51,995
Langdon's wounded.

1387
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:53,434
I'll look after him.

1388
01:21:53,499 --> 01:21:55,033
I ain't going
to leave him.

1389
01:21:55,098 --> 01:21:57,911
Another word
and i'll have you shot.

1390
01:21:57,976 --> 01:21:59,542
Join your company.

1391
01:22:03,091 --> 01:22:04,690
Yes, sir.

1392
01:22:06,449 --> 01:22:08,271
Don't give up, son.

1393
01:22:14,284 --> 01:22:16,329
Are you hurt bad?

1394
01:22:17,705 --> 01:22:21,893
That's the first thing
i've had in my stomach
in days.

1395
01:22:21,958 --> 01:22:23,971
Oh!

1396
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:28,320
Can you walk?

1397
01:22:29,632 --> 01:22:31,006
You know my orders.

1398
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:33,884
I can't let the men
carry extra burdens.

1399
01:22:33,948 --> 01:22:36,473
Have you tried to walk?

1400
01:22:38,265 --> 01:22:42,006
How do you know
you can't walk
unless you've tried?

1401
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:44,436
You know,
when people want to
badly enough,

1402
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,354
they do
all sorts of things

1403
01:22:46,419 --> 01:22:48,273
they didn't know
they could do.

1404
01:22:48,337 --> 01:22:50,159
What's a little piece
of lead

1405
01:22:50,224 --> 01:22:53,037
to a great big
husky fellow like you?

1406
01:22:53,102 --> 01:22:54,988
Say...

1407
01:22:55,052 --> 01:22:57,866
you've got
a sweetheart at home,
ain't you?

1408
01:22:57,930 --> 01:23:00,743
Well, now,
what are you
going to do,

1409
01:23:00,808 --> 01:23:02,182
lie here and rot

1410
01:23:02,247 --> 01:23:04,100
and let
some other fellow

1411
01:23:04,166 --> 01:23:05,540
take her away from you?

1412
01:23:05,604 --> 01:23:06,467
Hmm?

1413
01:23:06,532 --> 01:23:09,377
Where's that book
of yours?

1414
01:23:09,441 --> 01:23:10,815
Let's see.

1415
01:23:10,881 --> 01:23:14,109
Didn't i see the picture
of a pretty girl in here?

1416
01:23:14,174 --> 01:23:17,083
Why, sure i did.

1417
01:23:20,409 --> 01:23:22,358
My, my, my.

1418
01:23:24,054 --> 01:23:27,027
Do you think i'd lie here
like a newborn calf

1419
01:23:27,092 --> 01:23:29,425
if i had
a girl like that?

1420
01:23:29,490 --> 01:23:31,568
Not me.

1421
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:36,172
Is she really
as pretty as that?

1422
01:23:36,237 --> 01:23:38,283
Prettier.

1423
01:23:39,115 --> 01:23:41,225
Come on.

1424
01:23:41,289 --> 01:23:43,047
Come on!

1425
01:23:46,757 --> 01:23:50,081
Now, i'll
help you this far
but no farther.

1426
01:23:50,146 --> 01:23:53,951
A ranger puts
his left foot forward.

1427
01:23:55,423 --> 01:23:57,915
Now your right.

1428
01:23:57,981 --> 01:23:59,674
That's the spirit.

1429
01:23:59,739 --> 01:24:01,081
Left!

1430
01:24:01,146 --> 01:24:02,999

01:24:04,919 --> 01:24:06,261
Right!

1433
01:24:06,327 --> 01:24:08,052
Left!

1434
01:24:08,117 --> 01:24:09,075
Here, you!

1435
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:11,601
Whatever your name is,
come over here!

1436
01:24:11,666 --> 01:24:13,520
Bring that
little indian boy.

1437
01:24:13,585 --> 01:24:14,447
Right!

1438
01:24:14,512 --> 01:24:15,438
Left!

1439
01:24:15,503 --> 01:24:16,397
Right!

1440
01:24:16,463 --> 01:24:18,796
Your name is billy.
Get over here.

1441
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:20,682
Give this soldier
a little support

1442
01:24:20,747 --> 01:24:22,153
until that blood
stops running.

1443
01:24:22,218 --> 01:24:23,593
That's it. Left!

1444
01:24:23,657 --> 01:24:24,552
Right!

1445
01:24:24,616 --> 01:24:25,959
In a few days,

1446
01:24:26,023 --> 01:24:28,389
you'll lick any man
in the outfit.

1447
01:24:28,453 --> 01:24:29,827
Left! Right!

1448
01:24:29,892 --> 01:24:32,226
I'll see you
at sundown, harvard.

1449
01:24:32,290 --> 01:24:33,185
Left!

1450
01:24:33,249 --> 01:24:34,432
Right!

1451
01:24:52,435 --> 01:24:54,257
Keep on your feet,
turner.

1452
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:55,728
They're all you've got

1453
01:24:55,793 --> 01:24:57,838
between you and bread
and molasses.

1454
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:02,442
I'm glad
you can't see yourself
in those beads, mcneal.

1455
01:25:02,508 --> 01:25:04,809
Ha ha ha!

1456
01:25:06,345 --> 01:25:09,093
What have you got in
that knapsack, crofton?

1457
01:25:09,158 --> 01:25:10,533
Souvenir.

1458
01:25:10,598 --> 01:25:12,930
You better throw it away
if it's heavy.

1459
01:25:12,995 --> 01:25:14,817
It's not heavy.
It's light.

1460
01:25:14,882 --> 01:25:16,448
Ha ha ha!

1461
01:25:25,882 --> 01:25:27,767
Rangers...

1462
01:25:27,832 --> 01:25:29,110
fall out!

1463
01:25:29,176 --> 01:25:30,677
Make camp!

1464
01:25:30,742 --> 01:25:32,819
Marriner! Beacham!

1465
01:25:35,954 --> 01:25:37,584
Yes, sir.

1466
01:25:47,433 --> 01:25:48,808
Come on, son.

1467
01:25:48,872 --> 01:25:50,342
How are you feeling?

1468
01:25:50,407 --> 01:25:52,260
I'm all right.

1469
01:25:52,326 --> 01:25:53,220
Ah!

1470
01:25:53,285 --> 01:25:54,659
I'm first-rate.

1471
01:25:54,724 --> 01:25:56,162
That's good.

1472
01:25:56,227 --> 01:25:58,848
Don't you think
you better sit down?

1473
01:25:58,913 --> 01:26:01,566
No, i better not.

1474
01:26:01,631 --> 01:26:03,260
If i sat down,

1475
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:07,065
it might be pretty hard
to get up again.

1476
01:26:07,131 --> 01:26:09,623
No, i'd better not.

1477
01:26:12,406 --> 01:26:16,179
You sure ought to be glad
that hole isn't in you.

1478
01:26:16,243 --> 01:26:17,905
I guess you're right.

1479
01:26:17,970 --> 01:26:20,495
But that's as nice
a place for a hole

1480
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:23,341
as i could think of
if i thought all day...

1481
01:26:23,406 --> 01:26:25,739
if you have to
have a hole.

1482
01:26:25,804 --> 01:26:27,690
How far have we come?

1483
01:26:27,754 --> 01:26:31,047
Oh, about 15 miles,
as near as i can figure.

1484
01:26:31,112 --> 01:26:32,966
It's almost sundown,
isn't it?

1485
01:26:33,031 --> 01:26:33,925
Yeah.

1486
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:36,803
Jesse and me will
take you into camp.

1487
01:26:36,868 --> 01:26:39,201
You go with the women
where you belong.

1488
01:26:39,266 --> 01:26:40,640
I'm fixing his bandage.

1489
01:26:40,705 --> 01:26:42,079
I'll tend to that.

1490
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:44,080
Go on!
Do like i tell you.

1491
01:26:44,081 --> 01:26:46,481
Go on! Get out of here!
No! Leave me alone!

1492
01:26:51,834 --> 01:26:53,179
Here, you mink.

1493
01:26:53,244 --> 01:26:55,421
Don't you start
raising cain with these men

1494
01:26:55,485 --> 01:26:57,790
or i'll turn you loose
in the woods.

1495
01:26:57,854 --> 01:26:58,782
Soldier.

1496
01:26:58,848 --> 01:27:00,704
Go ahead.
Turn me loose.

1497
01:27:00,769 --> 01:27:02,817
I didn't ask
to come, did i?

1498
01:27:02,882 --> 01:27:05,315
Turn me loose,
why don't you?

1499
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:10,215
Some of us
could carry him, sir.

1500
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:13,128
Got a couple of poles i can
fasten a blanket between.

1501
01:27:13,194 --> 01:27:14,570
Like a hammock.

1502
01:27:14,635 --> 01:27:15,979
I won't do it.

1503
01:27:16,044 --> 01:27:17,900
I'm all right,
i tell you.

1504
01:27:17,965 --> 01:27:20,782
As long as i can
stay on my feet.

1505
01:27:20,848 --> 01:27:22,735
He's right.
If we carried him,

1506
01:27:22,801 --> 01:27:24,657
he'd be like
a baby for weeks.

1507
01:27:24,722 --> 01:27:27,539
If you can go
15 miles today
with that hole in you,

1508
01:27:27,604 --> 01:27:28,980
you can go anywhere.

1509
01:27:29,045 --> 01:27:31,381
How far is it
to lake memphremagog?

1510
01:27:31,447 --> 01:27:32,790
It's about...
ask her.

1511
01:27:32,856 --> 01:27:36,377
It looks like
she's going to
take care of you.

1512
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:40,796
Harvard,
i'm proud of you.

1513
01:27:56,873 --> 01:27:58,729
You've been eating
too much.

1514
01:27:58,794 --> 01:28:02,027
How much of that corn
have you eaten today?

1515
01:28:02,093 --> 01:28:03,469
I had two handsful.

1516
01:28:03,533 --> 01:28:04,910
I got pretty hungry.

1517
01:28:04,975 --> 01:28:07,151
Guess i must be
feeling better.

1518
01:28:07,217 --> 01:28:09,073
Well, you can't have it.

1519
01:28:09,138 --> 01:28:12,371
You'll walk 10 days
on 1 handful a day.

1520
01:28:12,436 --> 01:28:14,773
You're not going
to get more now.

1521
01:28:14,838 --> 01:28:17,527
Are we almost
to memphremagog?

1522
01:28:17,591 --> 01:28:20,505
Ask that big moose
up ahead.

1523
01:28:20,569 --> 01:28:23,515
There's the lake,
boys!

1524
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:26,557
Memphremagog,
plenty of fish there!

1525
01:28:26,622 --> 01:28:28,254
We're going to eat!

1526
01:28:28,319 --> 01:28:29,408
Food!

1527
01:28:31,714 --> 01:28:33,090
There's the lake.

1528
01:28:33,155 --> 01:28:34,115
This way!

1529
01:28:34,179 --> 01:28:36,485
Wait. Where do you
think you're going?

1530
01:28:36,549 --> 01:28:38,054
A mess of trout
for supper.

1531
01:28:38,118 --> 01:28:39,527
A mess of french lead

1532
01:28:39,591 --> 01:28:41,384
and hatchets for supper,
more likely.

1533
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:43,049
What's the matter
with you men?

1534
01:28:43,114 --> 01:28:46,411
But, major,
you said when we
reached the lake,

1535
01:28:46,476 --> 01:28:49,261
we could stop
to hunt and fish.

1536
01:28:49,327 --> 01:28:51,118
Sure you did.
Yeah.

1537
01:28:51,184 --> 01:28:52,560
Put yourselves
in the shoes

1538
01:28:52,625 --> 01:28:54,930
of that french commander
that found our boats.

1539
01:28:54,995 --> 01:28:58,580
If he's guessed
we came to memphremagog,
he came here, too.

1540
01:28:58,645 --> 01:29:00,982
I'm going down
with the indians to look.

1541
01:29:01,047 --> 01:29:03,544
The rest of you,
stay here

1542
01:29:03,608 --> 01:29:04,889
until i get back.

1543
01:29:04,954 --> 01:29:06,618
Major, my men are
mighty hungry.

1544
01:29:06,682 --> 01:29:08,667
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.

1545
01:29:08,732 --> 01:29:10,109
They've got corn,
haven't they?

1546
01:29:10,173 --> 01:29:12,510
Captain jacobs,
kankaba.

1547
01:29:24,648 --> 01:29:25,992
If you fellas
were smart,

1548
01:29:26,056 --> 01:29:28,105
you wouldn't
have to eat corn.

1549
01:29:35,567 --> 01:29:37,584
Hey, there.
Hey, there.

1550
01:29:37,649 --> 01:29:39,057
Don't take the red one.

1551
01:29:39,122 --> 01:29:40,690
I'm saving that
for dessert.

1552
01:29:43,157 --> 01:29:44,725
Where's the food?

1553
01:29:46,904 --> 01:29:49,560
Didn't we make it?

1554
01:29:49,625 --> 01:29:52,923
Langdon, you're just
in time for a little corn

1555
01:29:52,988 --> 01:29:55,453
with the rest
of us roosters.

1556
01:30:16,045 --> 01:30:19,022
See the patch
in that moccasin?

1557
01:30:19,087 --> 01:30:20,943
That moccasin
belonged to webster,

1558
01:30:21,008 --> 01:30:23,536
the man we left
in the swamp.

1559
01:30:23,602 --> 01:30:25,426
Same french indian
who killed webster.

1560
01:30:25,491 --> 01:30:27,251
They come here, too.

1561
01:30:27,317 --> 01:30:28,885
Mmm.

1562
01:30:30,039 --> 01:30:32,375
You can't expect
the men to keep going

1563
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:34,745
day in and day out
without food.

1564
01:30:34,810 --> 01:30:36,218
A few grains of corn

1565
01:30:36,283 --> 01:30:38,107
won't keep their bodies
in condition.

1566
01:30:38,172 --> 01:30:40,477
You said when we got
to lake memphremagog,

1567
01:30:40,542 --> 01:30:41,886
we could hunt and fish.

1568
01:30:41,951 --> 01:30:43,327
We've been talking
things over.

1569
01:30:43,392 --> 01:30:45,152
If we can't hunt here,

1570
01:30:45,218 --> 01:30:47,522
we think we should hold
an officers' council

1571
01:30:47,587 --> 01:30:51,269
and take a vote on what's
the best thing to do.

1572
01:30:51,334 --> 01:30:54,086
That's regulations,
if you want to do it
that way.

1573
01:30:54,152 --> 01:30:57,577
I vote to get to wentworth
as soon as we can.

1574
01:30:57,642 --> 01:30:59,755
But, major, my men
are starving.

1575
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:02,157
If we don't find
something to eat,

1576
01:31:02,221 --> 01:31:03,566
we won't go
anyplace.

1577
01:31:03,631 --> 01:31:04,558
That's right.

1578
01:31:04,623 --> 01:31:06,479
What do you want to do?

1579
01:31:06,545 --> 01:31:08,882
Stay here and fish
and get roasted alive?

1580
01:31:08,946 --> 01:31:12,243
No, sir,
but the men feel
they'll be all right

1581
01:31:12,309 --> 01:31:15,030
if they
could split up
into hunting parties

1582
01:31:15,095 --> 01:31:16,503
and look for game.

1583
01:31:16,568 --> 01:31:17,943
That's what
my detachment thinks.

1584
01:31:18,009 --> 01:31:20,345
We could hunt,
then join up together again

1585
01:31:20,411 --> 01:31:22,203
and meet
anyplace you say.

1586
01:31:22,268 --> 01:31:23,900
[Major rogers]
Your men grumbling, too?

1587
01:31:23,965 --> 01:31:26,782
Not grumbling,
they just want
a little food.

1588
01:31:26,847 --> 01:31:28,704
Game's as scarce
as hen's teeth.

1589
01:31:28,768 --> 01:31:31,586
Gone out
of the woods,
i guess.

1590
01:31:31,650 --> 01:31:33,507
A big party
like this

1591
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:35,300
will drive away
what's left.

1592
01:31:35,365 --> 01:31:37,638
Captain ogden,
what's your idea?

1593
01:31:37,703 --> 01:31:41,000
Well, sir, it's pretty hard
to drive hungry men,

1594
01:31:41,065 --> 01:31:45,035
but i think
we'd be better off
if we stick together.

1595
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:46,540
[Men jeer]

1596
01:31:46,606 --> 01:31:47,949
Now, wait a minute.

1597
01:31:48,014 --> 01:31:49,775
I agree with ogden.

1598
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,215
We're all pretty hungry,

1599
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:54,097
but a hungry man
can go on

1600
01:31:54,162 --> 01:31:56,499
a lot longer
than he thinks he can

1601
01:31:56,565 --> 01:31:57,940
if he keeps his courage.

1602
01:31:58,005 --> 01:31:59,830
You know,
i'm pretty hungry myself,

1603
01:31:59,895 --> 01:32:01,783
but it's better
to be hungry

1604
01:32:01,848 --> 01:32:04,185
than to be cut up alive
with hatchets.

1605
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:06,586
We'll be safe when we get
to wentworth.

1606
01:32:06,651 --> 01:32:09,724
That's only 100 miles
from here,
as the crow flies.

1607
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:12,479
But, major,
we ain't crows.

1608
01:32:12,544 --> 01:32:13,919
Wait a minute.

1609
01:32:13,985 --> 01:32:16,290
You know,
this is tricky country.

1610
01:32:16,354 --> 01:32:19,364
It would be
a mighty easy place

1611
01:32:19,428 --> 01:32:21,894
for a small party
to get ambushed in.

1612
01:32:21,958 --> 01:32:23,334
We'd better vote,
major.

1613
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:24,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

1614
01:32:24,744 --> 01:32:27,369
All right, we'll vote.

1615
01:32:29,035 --> 01:32:29,931
Aye.
Aye.

1616
01:32:29,996 --> 01:32:30,892
Aye.
Aye.

1617
01:32:30,956 --> 01:32:32,910
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.

1618
01:32:38,835 --> 01:32:40,403
Well, that settles it.

1619
01:32:43,318 --> 01:32:45,847
We'll split up
into four parties.

1620
01:32:47,801 --> 01:32:49,625
All detachments
will meet here

1621
01:32:49,690 --> 01:32:52,315
at eagle mountain.

1622
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:55,197
I'll have maps for you
before you leave.

1623
01:32:55,263 --> 01:32:58,079
And don't miss me
at eagle mountain

1624
01:32:58,145 --> 01:33:01,057
because you'll
never find wentworth
by yourselves.

1625
01:33:01,123 --> 01:33:03,460
All right,
get ready to go.

1626
01:33:03,524 --> 01:33:05,733
Number one company,
form over here.

1627
01:33:05,797 --> 01:33:07,655
Number two company,
form over here.

1628
01:33:07,719 --> 01:33:09,063
Number three company,
over here.

1629
01:33:09,129 --> 01:33:10,216
Sergeant mcnott.

1630
01:33:10,281 --> 01:33:11,177
Yes, sir.

1631
01:33:11,242 --> 01:33:12,617
Send the white women

1632
01:33:12,683 --> 01:33:14,059
with captain jacobs,
sergeant clark,

1633
01:33:14,124 --> 01:33:15,980
and half
of our scouts

1634
01:33:16,045 --> 01:33:18,029
straight
across to crown point.

1635
01:33:18,094 --> 01:33:18,958
Sergeant clark.

1636
01:33:19,023 --> 01:33:20,303
Yes, sir.

1637
01:33:22,866 --> 01:33:24,242
If them french
and injuns

1638
01:33:24,307 --> 01:33:26,644
would lend me
a boat and bait,

1639
01:33:26,709 --> 01:33:28,533
i'd go catch me a trout.

1640
01:33:28,598 --> 01:33:29,910
You ain't hungry,
are you?

1641
01:33:29,975 --> 01:33:31,479
I'd rather not
discuss it.

1642
01:33:31,544 --> 01:33:32,920
You won't starve.

1643
01:33:32,986 --> 01:33:34,938
I'll see to that.

1644
01:33:35,003 --> 01:33:37,948
Say, if you got food,
fetch it out.

1645
01:33:38,013 --> 01:33:40,189
No. You ain't
hungry enough yet.

1646
01:33:46,851 --> 01:33:48,099
Ha ha ha.

1647
01:33:51,527 --> 01:33:53,095
What's the matter
with crofton?

1648
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:54,728
I don't know, sir.

1649
01:34:05,264 --> 01:34:06,352
Crofton!

1650
01:34:08,563 --> 01:34:09,939
No, no, no, no!

1651
01:34:10,004 --> 01:34:11,860
That's mine!
That's mine!

1652
01:34:15,319 --> 01:34:17,368
I'll kill you.
I'll kill you,

1653
01:34:17,433 --> 01:34:19,450
and i'll eat
your head, too.

1654
01:34:25,471 --> 01:34:26,335
Crofton.

1655
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:28,192
No, no, no, rogers!

1656
01:34:28,257 --> 01:34:30,818
No, no, no!

1657
01:34:33,157 --> 01:34:34,821
Aah!

1658
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:02,777
What did he have
in that sack?

1659
01:35:02,842 --> 01:35:05,371
The head of
an abanochi indian.

1660
01:35:13,537 --> 01:35:15,201
I'm sending you
with farrington.

1661
01:35:15,267 --> 01:35:16,450
Why, sir?

1662
01:35:16,515 --> 01:35:18,788
Because you've
got an education
and farrington hasn't.

1663
01:35:18,853 --> 01:35:20,261
A man with an education

1664
01:35:20,326 --> 01:35:22,503
isn't apt to get discouraged
and quit

1665
01:35:22,567 --> 01:35:23,943
as quickly as one without.

1666
01:35:24,009 --> 01:35:25,865
Don't worry.
You've got one advantage

1667
01:35:25,930 --> 01:35:28,459
over the rest.
They just want to
stay alive,

1668
01:35:28,524 --> 01:35:31,085
but you want to stay alive
and paint pictures.

1669
01:35:31,150 --> 01:35:33,486
It's pretty hard
to destroy a man

1670
01:35:33,551 --> 01:35:35,664
who's got
a real incentive to live.

1671
01:35:35,729 --> 01:35:36,624
Yes, sir.

1672
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:38,546
Give one of those maps

1673
01:35:38,611 --> 01:35:40,916
to each
of the detachment commanders

1674
01:35:40,981 --> 01:35:42,741
and tell them, above all,

1675
01:35:42,806 --> 01:35:44,118
to watch out
for ambush.

1676
01:35:44,183 --> 01:35:45,783
I'll tell them, sir.

1677
01:35:48,538 --> 01:35:51,515
We'll make a ranger
out of you yet.

1678
01:36:17,167 --> 01:36:18,062
Major.

1679
01:36:18,128 --> 01:36:19,151
Well?

1680
01:36:19,216 --> 01:36:22,193
I'd like to go
and look after
langdon towne.

1681
01:36:22,258 --> 01:36:23,602
You can
help towne more

1682
01:36:23,667 --> 01:36:25,075
by fighting off
the french

1683
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:26,773
than by trying
to look after him

1684
01:36:26,837 --> 01:36:28,470
when he can look
after himself.

1685
01:36:28,535 --> 01:36:29,430
You're right.

1686
01:36:29,496 --> 01:36:31,479
But i'd hate
to be a man

1687
01:36:31,545 --> 01:36:33,561
and always be
as right as you are.

1688
01:36:33,626 --> 01:36:35,003
I'm not a man now.

1689
01:36:35,068 --> 01:36:36,828
I'm a soldier
in command of men.

1690
01:36:36,892 --> 01:36:40,126
If you ever meet me
when i'm just a man,

1691
01:36:40,191 --> 01:36:42,624
you may have to use
a little charity.

1692
01:36:42,689 --> 01:36:44,257
I'm sorry, major.

1693
01:36:44,322 --> 01:36:46,658
We'll meet towne
and everybody
at eagle mountain.

1694
01:36:46,724 --> 01:36:47,908
Thank you.

1695
01:37:02,928 --> 01:37:04,496
Let's get
those lizards.

1696
01:37:17,401 --> 01:37:18,778
Water's hot, major.

1697
01:37:18,843 --> 01:37:20,443
Good.

1698
01:37:22,525 --> 01:37:24,990
What have you got
to put in it?

1699
01:37:25,055 --> 01:37:26,015
Four hawks,

1700
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:27,360
five squirrels,

1701
01:37:27,425 --> 01:37:28,705
eight frogs,

1702
01:37:28,769 --> 01:37:29,697
three
partridges,

1703
01:37:29,763 --> 01:37:31,491
a wood sparrow,

1704
01:37:31,555 --> 01:37:33,413
a blue gingky,
27 lizards,

1705
01:37:33,477 --> 01:37:35,366
and a hat full
of minnows.

1706
01:37:35,431 --> 01:37:37,703
Well, it won't taste
like roast goose,

1707
01:37:37,768 --> 01:37:40,105
but it will take
the hunger cramps away.

1708
01:37:40,170 --> 01:37:42,539
Ogden, we're ready
for that rock tripe.

1709
01:37:42,604 --> 01:37:44,876
It will kill the taste
of the lizards.

1710
01:37:44,942 --> 01:37:46,061
Yes, sir.

1711
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:12,928
Come on,
dump them in, men.

1712
01:38:12,994 --> 01:38:15,842
There's more
hungry rangers
on the way.

1713
01:38:15,907 --> 01:38:18,788
Jesse, you can
have my share
of the stew.

1714
01:38:18,854 --> 01:38:20,934
Ain't you
feeling well, son?

1715
01:38:20,999 --> 01:38:23,144
I don't want it.

1716
01:38:23,209 --> 01:38:24,840
I'm going home.

1717
01:38:25,802 --> 01:38:28,139
Home? What are you
talking about?

1718
01:38:28,204 --> 01:38:31,310
I'm going home
for supper...

1719
01:38:31,374 --> 01:38:32,302
in concord.

1720
01:38:32,368 --> 01:38:35,345
Where do you
think concord is?

1721
01:38:36,467 --> 01:38:38,963
Right over there.

1722
01:38:39,028 --> 01:38:39,988
Look, avery.

1723
01:38:40,053 --> 01:38:41,013
Right over there!

1724
01:38:41,077 --> 01:38:41,974
Avery!

1725
01:38:42,038 --> 01:38:43,606
Let him go.

1726
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:47,129
You can't catch him,

1727
01:38:47,193 --> 01:38:48,858
and i
won't shoot him.

1728
01:38:52,317 --> 01:38:54,494
Where do you
think he'll land?

1729
01:38:54,559 --> 01:38:56,896
Right in the middle
of those hills.

1730
01:38:56,961 --> 01:38:59,714
Maybe next summer,
somebody will find
a leather hair ribbon

1731
01:38:59,779 --> 01:39:01,155
and be christian
enough

1732
01:39:01,220 --> 01:39:03,717
to bury whatever
they find with it.

1733
01:39:04,998 --> 01:39:06,855
Don't swallow
those bones, men.

1734
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:08,264
If you're stomach's
empty,

1735
01:39:08,329 --> 01:39:10,217
they'll cut
right through you.

1736
01:39:10,283 --> 01:39:12,620
Be at fort wentworth
before long.

1737
01:39:12,684 --> 01:39:14,541
We'll get some real food.

1738
01:39:14,605 --> 01:39:16,173
Be careful, now, men.

1739
01:39:21,619 --> 01:39:23,187
Just a little bit.

1740
01:39:24,757 --> 01:39:27,093
I know it's
not chicken broth,

1741
01:39:27,158 --> 01:39:29,975
but get it down
and keep it down.

1742
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:32,794
Whatever it tastes like,
boys, it's food.

1743
01:39:32,858 --> 01:39:34,235
Hold your nose, son.

1744
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:37,597
Your stomach will never
know the difference.

1745
01:39:37,662 --> 01:39:40,159
It will get you
to wentworth.

1746
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:42,241
Yo, rangers!

1747
01:39:42,305 --> 01:39:45,090
Yo, rangers!

1748
01:39:53,578 --> 01:39:54,953
Grant's detachment, sir.

1749
01:39:55,018 --> 01:39:56,362
Where are the rest?

1750
01:39:56,427 --> 01:39:57,803
Captured.
We shot a moose.

1751
01:39:57,869 --> 01:40:00,109
We were hungry enough
to eat it raw,

1752
01:40:00,174 --> 01:40:02,543
but mcneal started
yelling about stopping
to cook it.

1753
01:40:02,608 --> 01:40:05,393
I guess the french
heard our shot.

1754
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:08,275
They made us carry it
back to camp.

1755
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:10,196
Then they tied us up

1756
01:40:10,262 --> 01:40:11,926
until they
started killing...

1757
01:40:13,079 --> 01:40:15,032
[major rogers]
Go on.

1758
01:40:15,097 --> 01:40:18,874
Well, they gave us
a bone apiece to gnaw on,

1759
01:40:18,940 --> 01:40:22,909
but mcneal here
sawed his thongs
in two in the night,

1760
01:40:22,974 --> 01:40:24,830
and he let me loose, too.

1761
01:40:24,896 --> 01:40:26,272
Good work,
mcneal.

1762
01:40:26,337 --> 01:40:27,329
Yes, sir.

1763
01:40:27,394 --> 01:40:28,289
Skunk!

1764
01:40:28,354 --> 01:40:29,506
Aah!

1765
01:40:29,571 --> 01:40:31,907
If you'd eaten
that moose raw,

1766
01:40:31,973 --> 01:40:33,413
we'd have something
inside us!

1767
01:40:33,477 --> 01:40:34,854
Come on!
Stop that!

1768
01:40:34,919 --> 01:40:36,775
Rangers don't
act like that!

1769
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:38,088
Get up!

1770
01:40:38,153 --> 01:40:39,209
Get up!

1771
01:40:39,274 --> 01:40:41,675
Beats all how
many people there are

1772
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:44,877
that don't know enough
to thank god
they're still alive!

1773
01:40:48,625 --> 01:40:50,481
See anything
of dunbar's men

1774
01:40:50,546 --> 01:40:52,627
or farrington
or towne?

1775
01:40:52,691 --> 01:40:54,740
No, sir,
not a thing.

1776
01:40:56,342 --> 01:40:59,191
Eat some of that stew.
You'll feel better.

1777
01:40:59,257 --> 01:41:00,888
Yes, sir.
Come on.

1778
01:41:05,789 --> 01:41:08,157
I wonder what
kind of food

1779
01:41:08,222 --> 01:41:10,143
amherst
has sent to
fort wentworth.

1780
01:41:10,208 --> 01:41:14,466
I don't know, but i wished
he sent old cap huff

1781
01:41:14,531 --> 01:41:16,676
from studely's tavern
back in portsmouth.

1782
01:41:16,741 --> 01:41:19,526
He's a friend of mine
and langdon towne's.

1783
01:41:19,590 --> 01:41:21,448
He'd bring
them big sausages

1784
01:41:21,512 --> 01:41:23,401
and hams
cured almost black,

1785
01:41:23,466 --> 01:41:25,290
chocolate cakes
and ripe cheeses

1786
01:41:25,355 --> 01:41:27,756
and cigars
from the sugar islands.

1787
01:41:27,821 --> 01:41:28,781
Yeah.

1788
01:41:28,845 --> 01:41:32,143
That pale brown rum
that makes a man feel

1789
01:41:32,208 --> 01:41:35,025
like he was half moose,
half panther

1790
01:41:35,090 --> 01:41:36,658
in a touch
of an earthquake.

1791
01:41:36,724 --> 01:41:40,020
You know what we used
to call them minnows

1792
01:41:40,085 --> 01:41:42,902
like we threw
in the stew last night?

1793
01:41:42,968 --> 01:41:45,657
Little stinkpins.

1794
01:41:45,722 --> 01:41:47,514
Aw...

1795
01:41:47,579 --> 01:41:49,916
you always spoil
everything.

1796
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:01,508
Rogers' rangers!

1797
01:42:07,432 --> 01:42:09,032
Farrington's
detachment, sir.

1798
01:42:09,097 --> 01:42:11,176
Glad to see you,
captain.

1799
01:42:14,539 --> 01:42:15,883
Carry on,
men.

1800
01:42:15,948 --> 01:42:17,100
Carry on.

1801
01:42:18,446 --> 01:42:19,533
Where's
towne?

1802
01:42:19,598 --> 01:42:22,383
He went back
to see that dunbar
didn't get lost.

1803
01:42:22,448 --> 01:42:23,792
Didn't you wait
for him?

1804
01:42:23,857 --> 01:42:26,321
We waited 12 hours.
Had these men
to think of.

1805
01:42:26,386 --> 01:42:27,313
Yeah, but...

1806
01:42:27,378 --> 01:42:29,555
that's quite right.
Give him some food.

1807
01:42:29,620 --> 01:42:31,699
Yes, sir.
Come along, captain.

1808
01:42:35,895 --> 01:42:36,822
Marriner.

1809
01:42:36,888 --> 01:42:39,224
You want to look
for towne,

1810
01:42:39,288 --> 01:42:40,729
your duty's
done here.

1811
01:42:40,794 --> 01:42:43,482
Thank you, sir.
I'll get my musket.

1812
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:46,940
Major rogers!

1813
01:42:47,005 --> 01:42:49,309
Ranger towne!

1814
01:42:50,110 --> 01:42:51,038
Langdon!

1815
01:42:51,103 --> 01:42:54,368
How are you, son?

1816
01:42:54,433 --> 01:42:56,001
I was worried
about you.

1817
01:43:08,616 --> 01:43:11,434
Glad to see you,
my boy.

1818
01:43:11,498 --> 01:43:13,610
Where's dunbar?

1819
01:43:13,675 --> 01:43:15,531
Ambushed.

1820
01:43:15,596 --> 01:43:16,972
I saw what happened,

1821
01:43:17,037 --> 01:43:19,341
but i couldn't help him.

1822
01:43:19,407 --> 01:43:21,231
When they cut up dunbar,

1823
01:43:21,295 --> 01:43:23,920
he was still alive
and screaming.

1824
01:43:23,985 --> 01:43:25,713
Any of them
get away?

1825
01:43:25,778 --> 01:43:26,673
No.

1826
01:43:26,739 --> 01:43:28,690
They killed them all.

1827
01:43:30,452 --> 01:43:32,340
They were playing ball...

1828
01:43:32,406 --> 01:43:33,813
with their heads.

1829
01:43:33,879 --> 01:43:35,926
Playing ball
with their heads?

1830
01:43:40,346 --> 01:43:42,714
You men better dry
your blankets.

1831
01:43:42,779 --> 01:43:44,155
If the weather
changes,

1832
01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:46,620
we might have
a little trouble.

1833
01:43:46,685 --> 01:43:49,757
We might have
a little trouble.

1834
01:43:49,823 --> 01:43:52,832
<i>We might have
a little trouble.</i>

1835
01:43:52,896 --> 01:43:55,713
I don't know
but what is right.

1836
01:43:55,778 --> 01:43:57,346
Come on, son.

1837
01:44:00,036 --> 01:44:03,333
Towne, you can take over
the orderly book again.

1838
01:44:03,398 --> 01:44:05,734
When did you
make these pictures?

1839
01:44:05,799 --> 01:44:08,136
On the way
to st. Francis...

1840
01:44:08,201 --> 01:44:09,993
about 100 years ago.

1841
01:44:11,275 --> 01:44:12,938
Mcnott.

1842
01:44:13,004 --> 01:44:14,668
Kankaba.

1843
01:44:14,732 --> 01:44:17,133
Mmm. I can smell him.

1844
01:44:17,198 --> 01:44:19,150
Major robert rogers.

1845
01:44:19,215 --> 01:44:20,494
No flattery either.

1846
01:44:20,559 --> 01:44:22,927
My boy,
you're quite an artist.

1847
01:44:22,993 --> 01:44:25,777
Oh, here's the lady again.
Who is she anyway?

1848
01:44:25,843 --> 01:44:28,082
She lives
in portsmouth.

1849
01:44:28,147 --> 01:44:29,491
By jove,
she is beautiful.

1850
01:44:29,556 --> 01:44:31,924
Make a man
swallow his tobacco

1851
01:44:31,989 --> 01:44:33,365
just to look at her.

1852
01:44:33,431 --> 01:44:34,774
She's proud, though.
Ambitious.

1853
01:44:34,839 --> 01:44:36,247
She knows
what she wants,

1854
01:44:36,312 --> 01:44:38,360
and she's
going to get it.

1855
01:44:46,301 --> 01:44:49,086
Well, men,
we've come all this way,

1856
01:44:49,151 --> 01:44:51,519
and there's still 50
of us left.

1857
01:44:51,584 --> 01:44:54,241
That's 50 more than
general amherst expects.

1858
01:44:54,306 --> 01:44:57,122
Now on we go
to fort wentworth.

1859
01:44:57,187 --> 01:44:58,563
Only three days away,

1860
01:44:58,628 --> 01:45:01,444
then all the things
we've dreamed about...

1861
01:45:01,509 --> 01:45:02,405
roasted beef,

1862
01:45:02,470 --> 01:45:03,846
ham, bacon,

1863
01:45:03,911 --> 01:45:05,350
chocolate, coffee,

1864
01:45:05,416 --> 01:45:08,168
and plenty
of hot buttered rum.

1865
01:45:08,233 --> 01:45:09,097
Does that sound good?

1866
01:45:09,162 --> 01:45:10,665
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

1867
01:45:10,731 --> 01:45:11,818
Then form ranks.

1868
01:45:11,883 --> 01:45:14,027
Number one company,
on your feet.

1869
01:45:14,092 --> 01:45:15,948
Number two company,
fall in.

1870
01:45:16,013 --> 01:45:17,069
Fall in.

1871
01:45:17,134 --> 01:45:18,990
Hurry it along.

1872
01:45:20,207 --> 01:45:21,487
Forward!

1873
01:45:29,717 --> 01:45:31,349
Right, left.

1874
01:45:31,414 --> 01:45:32,918
Right, left.

1875
01:45:32,983 --> 01:45:34,326
Right, left.

1876
01:45:34,391 --> 01:45:35,831
Right, left.

1877
01:45:35,896 --> 01:45:37,464
Right, left.

1878
01:45:37,529 --> 01:45:39,225
Right, left.

1879
01:45:39,290 --> 01:45:40,921
Right, left.

1880
01:45:40,987 --> 01:45:42,971
Right, left.

1881
01:45:43,036 --> 01:45:44,667
Right...

1882
01:45:44,733 --> 01:45:45,692
left.

1883
01:45:45,757 --> 01:45:46,813
Right.

1884
01:45:46,878 --> 01:45:48,382
We'll get...

1885
01:45:48,447 --> 01:45:50,367
army rations...

1886
01:45:50,431 --> 01:45:51,616
coffee, sugar...

1887
01:45:51,681 --> 01:45:53,568
come on, men, keep moving.

1888
01:45:53,634 --> 01:45:55,650
Stay on your feet, men.

1889
01:45:55,715 --> 01:45:58,787
Come on, men, come on.
Keep moving, men.

1890
01:45:58,853 --> 01:46:00,965
Stay on your feet, men.

1891
01:46:01,030 --> 01:46:03,558
Come on, keep moving.
Keep moving.

1892
01:46:03,623 --> 01:46:05,383
Keep moving.
We're almost there.

1893
01:46:05,448 --> 01:46:07,111
Right, left.

1894
01:46:07,177 --> 01:46:08,776
Right, right.

1895
01:46:08,842 --> 01:46:10,442
Left, right, left.

1896
01:46:10,506 --> 01:46:12,074
Shut up!

1897
01:46:12,140 --> 01:46:14,156
Left, right.

1898
01:46:14,221 --> 01:46:16,205
Left, right.

1899
01:46:17,519 --> 01:46:18,990
1, 2.

1900
01:46:19,055 --> 01:46:20,527
1, 2.

1901
01:46:20,592 --> 01:46:21,968
1, 2.

1902
01:46:22,033 --> 01:46:23,440
We're almost there.

1903
01:46:23,506 --> 01:46:25,042
1, 2.

1904
01:46:25,106 --> 01:46:26,226
1, 2.

1905
01:46:26,291 --> 01:46:27,186
Wentworth!

1906
01:46:27,252 --> 01:46:28,499
Fort wentworth!

1907
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:37,689
There she is, men,

1908
01:46:37,753 --> 01:46:39,737
just as i told you.

1909
01:46:39,803 --> 01:46:42,939
Only two miles more,
then food.

1910
01:46:43,004 --> 01:46:45,949
Come on, now.
Quick on your feet.

1911
01:46:46,014 --> 01:46:47,678
No falling behind,
men.

1912
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:51,808
[Bang]

1913
01:46:54,275 --> 01:46:55,650
[Bang]

1914
01:46:55,715 --> 01:46:57,507
Fort, it's rogers!

1915
01:46:57,572 --> 01:47:00,613
Put it on the table.
We're all ready.

1916
01:47:00,678 --> 01:47:04,871
Come on, redcoats,
bring out the roast beef!

1917
01:47:06,825 --> 01:47:07,913
[Cough]

1918
01:47:09,002 --> 01:47:10,410
[Bang]

1919
01:47:14,605 --> 01:47:17,294
It's rogers!

1920
01:47:17,359 --> 01:47:19,502
Fort wentworth,
it's rogers!

1921
01:47:19,568 --> 01:47:21,488
Rogers' rangers!

1922
01:47:22,674 --> 01:47:24,113
Fort wentworth...

1923
01:47:26,260 --> 01:47:28,340
fort, it's rogers.

1924
01:47:29,429 --> 01:47:32,182
Rogers' rangers,
back from st. Francis!

1925
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:36,568
Where is everyone?

1926
01:47:36,633 --> 01:47:40,186
Fort... fort,
it's rogers!

1927
01:47:40,251 --> 01:47:42,555
Rogers' rangers from...

1928
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:44,765
hey, we're back.

1929
01:48:14,605 --> 01:48:16,014
Almost there.

1930
01:48:16,078 --> 01:48:19,183
I never thought
we would eat again.

1931
01:48:19,248 --> 01:48:21,584
Hope there will be
some steak.

1932
01:48:21,649 --> 01:48:23,921
I'll take gravy.

1933
01:48:35,993 --> 01:48:38,041
Rangers...

1934
01:48:38,107 --> 01:48:39,482
attention.

1935
01:48:41,693 --> 01:48:44,188
Come on, men, fall in.

1936
01:48:44,254 --> 01:48:47,070
Press it up,
press it up here.

1937
01:48:47,135 --> 01:48:48,607
Listen up.

1938
01:48:48,672 --> 01:48:50,143
Forward.

1939
01:48:50,209 --> 01:48:51,360
March.

1940
01:48:57,380 --> 01:48:59,204
Steady, men.

1941
01:48:59,270 --> 01:49:00,390
Take care.

1942
01:49:01,895 --> 01:49:03,015
Steady.

1943
01:49:04,360 --> 01:49:06,024
Take care, men.

1944
01:49:09,227 --> 01:49:12,172
Rangers...

1945
01:49:12,236 --> 01:49:13,964
halt.

1946

Left face.

1947
01:49:14,990 --> 01:49:20,048
Quarter arms.

1948
01:49:20,113 --> 01:49:21,969
The first thing
we've got to do

1949
01:49:22,034 --> 01:49:23,890
is get this fort in shape

1950
01:49:23,955 --> 01:49:25,299
for amherst and his men

1951
01:49:25,364 --> 01:49:26,899
when they arrive
with the food.

1952
01:49:26,964 --> 01:49:29,076
Farrington's men
will clean up the grounds.

1953
01:49:29,142 --> 01:49:31,222
Rogers' men will look
for roots and fish.

1954
01:49:31,287 --> 01:49:33,975
Lots of roots here.
Good to eat, too.

1955
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:36,761
Marriner, take some men
and burn this litter.

1956
01:49:36,826 --> 01:49:38,875
Fall out
and get to work.

1957
01:49:41,149 --> 01:49:42,972
You heard the order,
men.

1958
01:49:43,037 --> 01:49:44,509
Get to work.

1959
01:49:44,574 --> 01:49:46,911
Major, in the name of god,
let them rest.

1960
01:49:46,975 --> 01:49:48,319
Let them die!

1961
01:49:48,384 --> 01:49:50,785
We've lived on your promises
long enough!

1962
01:49:50,850 --> 01:49:53,122
We can't stand
anymore!

1963
01:49:54,532 --> 01:49:55,908
They're right, major.

1964
01:49:55,972 --> 01:49:57,764
We won't do it.

1965
01:49:58,982 --> 01:49:59,877
Get up.

1966
01:49:59,943 --> 01:50:02,279
Get up
and start your fires.

1967
01:50:02,343 --> 01:50:05,128
Fires and warm shelter,
that's something, isn't it?

1968
01:50:05,193 --> 01:50:07,305
Get up.
Stand on your feet

1969
01:50:07,371 --> 01:50:09,226
and do what's to be done.

1970
01:50:09,292 --> 01:50:10,635
You're going
to act like rangers.

1971
01:50:10,700 --> 01:50:12,589
They'll be here
with the food.

1972
01:50:12,653 --> 01:50:14,989
I've never promised
you anything
that you didn't get.

1973
01:50:15,055 --> 01:50:19,376
Until they get here,
you've got to make
this place fit to live in.

1974
01:50:19,441 --> 01:50:23,218
Why? Because you're not fit
to go on any farther,

1975
01:50:23,283 --> 01:50:24,659
and when that happens,

1976
01:50:24,724 --> 01:50:28,501
you've got to stop
and live here where you are.

1977
01:50:28,566 --> 01:50:32,087
You know, you could be
a lot worse off.

1978
01:50:32,152 --> 01:50:34,392
Towne...
towne's an educated man.

1979
01:50:34,457 --> 01:50:36,825
Wasn't there somebody
in the bible

1980
01:50:36,890 --> 01:50:39,707
who went without
any food for 40 days?

1981
01:50:39,772 --> 01:50:41,276
40 days?

1982
01:50:41,341 --> 01:50:44,125
I think there was
someone in the bible

1983
01:50:44,191 --> 01:50:46,078
who fasted for 40 days.

1984
01:50:46,143 --> 01:50:48,032
Uh, moses, i think.

1985
01:50:48,096 --> 01:50:50,849
There. Do you hear
what towne says?

1986
01:50:50,914 --> 01:50:54,723
Moses went without
the slightest taste
of food for 40 days.

1987
01:50:54,788 --> 01:50:57,125
He didn't have
any good cooked roots.

1988
01:50:57,189 --> 01:51:00,102
He didn't have
a single bite,
did he, towne?

1989
01:51:00,167 --> 01:51:02,695
No, not a thing.
No food, no water.

1990
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:04,649
There. Do you hear that?

1991
01:51:04,714 --> 01:51:06,570
No food and no water.

1992
01:51:06,635 --> 01:51:09,195
Look at the water
we've got.

1993
01:51:09,260 --> 01:51:10,635
Good, clean, fresh water.

1994
01:51:10,700 --> 01:51:13,485
What do you suppose moses
would have given

1995
01:51:13,550 --> 01:51:14,958
for a mug of it,

1996
01:51:15,023 --> 01:51:17,359
let alone buckets-full
like we've got?

1997
01:51:17,424 --> 01:51:18,800
Instead of lying here,

1998
01:51:18,865 --> 01:51:20,240
doing nothing, giving up,

1999
01:51:20,306 --> 01:51:23,155
we should be giving thanks
for what we've got.

2000

2001

i'm not much
of a hand at prayer,

2002
01:51:27,062 --> 01:51:30,358
but maybe i can remember
a few bible verses

2003
01:51:30,423 --> 01:51:32,279
that i've
always believe in

2004
01:51:32,344 --> 01:51:34,392

2089
01:57:37,181 --> 01:57:39,357
by the great
western ocean itself.

2090
01:57:39,422 --> 01:57:42,623
You're going to find a way
across this continent,

2091
01:57:42,688 --> 01:57:44,064
a northwest passage.

2092
01:57:44,129 --> 01:57:46,753
You'll see hardwood groves
like cathedrals,

2093
01:57:46,819 --> 01:57:49,859
corn stalks
as tall as elms,

2094
01:57:49,924 --> 01:57:51,780
rivers packed
with salmon trout,

2095
01:57:51,845 --> 01:57:53,221
and grass so high

2096
01:57:53,286 --> 01:57:56,102
the cows stand
knee-deep in it

2097
01:57:56,168 --> 01:57:57,767
and give nothing
but cream.

2098
01:58:00,137 --> 01:58:02,026
Just think
of all the lands

2099
01:58:02,090 --> 01:58:04,427
and the peoples
you're going to see,

2100
01:58:04,492 --> 01:58:06,348
and all
at the king's expense.

2101
01:58:06,413 --> 01:58:07,789
Just think of it.

2102
01:58:07,853 --> 01:58:10,670
A trip any man would give
his soul to make,

2103
01:58:10,735 --> 01:58:13,071
and you're going
to get it all free.

2104
01:58:13,136 --> 01:58:14,961
Oh, i forgot to tell you,

2105
01:58:15,026 --> 01:58:17,298
you won't have any boats
to row.

2106
01:58:17,362 --> 01:58:19,891
All you have to do
is just walk along

2107
01:58:19,956 --> 01:58:20,947
through ottawas,

2108
01:58:21,013 --> 01:58:22,453
chipewyans, wyandots,

2109
01:58:22,517 --> 01:58:24,214
miamis, sauks,

2110
01:58:24,279 --> 01:58:26,903
shawnees, sioux.

2111
01:58:26,968 --> 01:58:29,304
Well, i'll sort them
all out to you

2112
01:58:29,369 --> 01:58:30,905
when we get to them.

2113
01:58:30,970 --> 01:58:32,890
Rangers, attention!

2114
01:58:32,955 --> 01:58:35,963
Left step, march.

2115
01:58:36,029 --> 01:58:38,813
Forward, march.

2116
01:58:38,879 --> 01:58:40,959
[Band plays]

2117
01:58:47,587 --> 01:58:49,763
Ain't you going?

2118
01:58:51,621 --> 01:58:52,837
I've been.

2119
01:58:55,591 --> 01:58:56,967
All your life, langdon,

2120
01:58:57,032 --> 01:59:00,009
are you going to be sorry
you didn't go?

2121
01:59:00,073 --> 01:59:01,930
No. I've made
my choice,

2122
01:59:01,994 --> 01:59:03,370
but before i'm done,

2123
01:59:03,436 --> 01:59:05,068
his face
will look down

2124
01:59:05,132 --> 01:59:07,469
from
the art galleries
of the world

2125
01:59:07,534 --> 01:59:09,390
on the history
he's made...

2126
01:59:09,455 --> 01:59:11,471
the history
he's going to make.

2127
01:59:13,553 --> 01:59:15,601
Eyes left!

2128
01:59:23,158 --> 01:59:24,502
Too bad
your sweetheart

2129
01:59:24,567 --> 01:59:26,871
won't let you
out of her sight.

2130
01:59:26,936 --> 01:59:28,248
She's not holding
me back.

2131
01:59:28,313 --> 01:59:30,202
Yes, she is.
She wants you

2132
01:59:30,266 --> 01:59:32,827
to stay at home.
Isn't that right?

2133
01:59:32,891 --> 01:59:35,292
No. I don't want him
to stay at home.

2134
01:59:35,357 --> 01:59:36,732
We're going to london.

2135
01:59:36,798 --> 01:59:37,693
London?

2136
01:59:37,758 --> 01:59:40,382
Yes. I want him
to be a great painter.

2137
01:59:40,448 --> 01:59:43,200
There you are. I told you
she was ambitious.

2138
01:59:43,265 --> 01:59:45,537
You'll never end up
an amateur mapmaker

2139
01:59:45,602 --> 01:59:48,899
who gets himself shot
every time he looks
at an indian.

2140
01:59:48,964 --> 01:59:51,781
This passage you hope
to find, major.

2141
01:59:51,845 --> 01:59:53,254
Is there such a thing?

2142
01:59:53,318 --> 01:59:56,135
There's bound to be.
Before i'm done,
i'll load a canoe

2143
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:58,536
with the goods
of japan and end

2144
01:59:58,602 --> 02:00:01,193
by coming down
the hudson river
to new york.

2145
02:00:06,926 --> 02:00:09,006
I'll see you at sundown,
harvard.

2146
02:00:26,905 --> 02:00:28,633
Is there, langdon?

2147
02:00:28,697 --> 02:00:31,386
Is there
a northwest passage?

2148
02:00:31,451 --> 02:00:32,667
Who knows?

2149
02:00:32,732 --> 02:00:34,140
It's every man's dream

2150
02:00:34,204 --> 02:00:37,501
to find a short route
to his heart's desire.

2151
02:00:37,566 --> 02:00:40,863
If the major
dreams long enough,
he'll find it.

2152
02:00:40,928 --> 02:00:42,688
Will we hear
from him?

2153
02:00:42,753 --> 02:00:44,097
Hear from him?

2154
02:00:44,162 --> 02:00:46,979
Every time we look
across a river,

2155
02:00:47,044 --> 02:00:48,452
we'll hear his voice,

2156
02:00:48,516 --> 02:00:50,725
calling us
through the wind.

2157
02:00:50,789 --> 02:00:53,158
But he'll be within us,
elizabeth,

2158
02:00:53,223 --> 02:00:56,776
no matter where we are
or he may be...

2159
02:00:56,841 --> 02:00:59,369
for that man
will never die.
