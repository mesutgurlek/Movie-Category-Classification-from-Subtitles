THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

163

164

166
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:45,992
LOOK AT ME.

167
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,596
IF I HELD YOU UP,
WOULD YOU GIVE ME
YOUR MONEY?

168
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:54,134
WELL...WELL,

LOOK TOO GOOD

169
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,569
WHEN HE FIRST
STARTED, EITHER.

170
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,271
WAIT.

171
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:01,541
BUT, CHICO,
I CAN'T EVEN RIDE.

172

YOU SAW ME FALL OFF
THAT--THAT HORSE.

173
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:05,078
WELL, EVERYONE CAN
HAVE AN ACCIDENT.

174
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:06,546
THAT WAS NO ACCIDENT.

175
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:08,581
I'VE BEEN FALLING OFF
THAT HORSE EVER SINCE
I GOT HIM.

176
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,050
I--I'M AFRAID OF HIM.

177
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,652
I'M AFRAID OF FIGHTS AND--
AND LOUD NOISES AND--

178
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,721
WELL, I'M PRACTICALLY
AFRAID OF EVERYTHING.

179
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,424
NEARLY EVERYBODY
IS AFRAID OF
NEARLY EVERYTHING.

180
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,326
ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS NOT TO SHOW IT.

181
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,996
HA HA!
YEAH, THAT WAS
YOUR FATHER'S.

182
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,597
AW, IT'S NO USE,
CHICO.

183
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:25,865
WAIT, WAIT.

184
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,835
HERE.

185
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,870
YOUR FATHER'S
SOMBRERO.

186
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,472
OH, YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR TIME.

187
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:33,840
AY, WHAT
A DIFFERENCE.

188
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,842
ALREADY YOU LOOK
TWICE AS BIG.

189
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,877
SURE. LOOK AT YOURSELF
IN THE GLASS.

190
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,145
GO ON, LOOK.

191
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,151
OH, YOU LOOK
JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER.

192
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:48,822
IF I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS YOU,
I WOULD THINK IT WAS HIM.

193
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,024
YOU WERE BORN
TO BE A BANDIT.

194
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,029
YOU KNOW,
I READ A LOT OF BOOKS
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY

195
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,933
ABOUT BANDITS
LIKE ROBIN HOOD
AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

196
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,901
MUST BE A RATHER
EXCITING LIFE.

197
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,103
AHA!

198
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,305
YOU READ BOOKS
ABOUT THE BANDITS?

199
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,507
THEN YOU KNOW
PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING.

200
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,642
AND WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW,
I WILL SHOW YOU.

201
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,278
YOU GONNA BE RICH AND FAMOUS
LIKE YOUR FATHER.

202
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,614
THEN I WILL BE HAPPY,
THE MEN WILL BE HAPPY,

203
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:18,184
AND EVERYONE WILL KNOW
THE KISSING BANDIT
IS RIDING AGAIN.

204
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,554
UH-HUH.

205
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,657
CHICO, WHY DID
THEY CALL MY FATHER
THE KISSING BANDIT?

206
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,360
OH, EVERY BANDIT CHIEF
GOT A TRADEMARK.

207
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:30,497
AFTER EVERY ROBBERY,
YOUR FATHER USED
TO KISS THE WOMEN,

208
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,598
LIKE YOU GONNA DO.

209
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,501
HEH HEH!
THAT WAS HIS TRADEMARK.

210
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,603
YOU MEAN HE KISSED WOMEN
HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW?

211
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,505
SURE.
WOMEN HE WASN'T
INTRODUCED TO?

212
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,373
OH, BUT YOU
GONNA LIKE IT.

213
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,175
OH, NO, I WON'T.

214
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,711
WHY, IN BOSTON,
YOU DON'T EVEN KISS
WOMEN YOU DO KNOW--

215
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:46,212
NOT UNTIL YOU'RE
ENGAGED TO THEM.

216
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,614
AH, BUT WAIT.

217
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:49,215
KISSING IS THE BEST
PART OF THE JOB,

218
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:52,252
BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA,
ALL THE WOMEN ARE BEAUTIFUL.

219
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,889
WE GOT NOTHING BUT
BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.

220
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,132
Woman: TERESA,
THE CARRIAGE
IS WAITING,

221
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,834
AND YOUR AUNT IS
GETTING NERVOUS.

222
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,169
OH, THANK YOU, SISTER.

223
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:17,177
TERESA,
ARE YOU SAD ABOUT
LEAVING THE SCHOOL?

224
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,478
HMM.

225
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:19,746
WELL,

00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,381

259
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,955
IT IS GOOD IDEA,
CHICO,

260
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,557
PUTTING HIM UP THERE
OUT OF THE WAY.

261
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:18,925
AY, IT'S GOOD.

262
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:21,094
I NEVER THOUGHT
HE WOULD GIVE IN
SO EASY.

263
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:24,264
WELL, IT'S WHAT HE
THINKS A BANDIT CHIEF
SHOULD LOOK LIKE--

264
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,467
A MAN ON A WHITE HORSE
WAY UP IN THE CLOUDS...

265
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,602
WHERE HE'S NICE AND SAFE.

266
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,071
I TOLD HIM
WHEN THE COACH STOPS,

267
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,405
TO COME DOWN
THE BACK WAY.

268
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,240
THAT WILL TAKE
A LONG TIME.

269
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,009
BY THEN
THE HOLDUP IS FINISHED,

270
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:37,977
SO HE CAN KISS THE WOMEN
WHO ARE AROUND.

271
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,046
IT'S A NICE, GOOD PLAN.

272
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,915
YOU TOLD HIM HE'S
GOT TO KISS, EH?

273

OH, I MADE HIM SWEAR.

00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:22,082
BUT YOU SAID
HE WAS NICE-LOOKING.

469
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:24,351
DID I? WELL, UH...

470
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,419
IT ISN'T AS THOUGH
I SAW HIS FACE,
YOU SEE.

471
00:26:26,486 --> 00:26:28,154
UH, HE WORE A MASK.

472
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:31,124
BUT YOU SAID
HE DIDN'T WEAR A MASK.

473
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:34,327
OH, WELL,
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING.

GO TO YOUR ROOM

478

ANY MORE ABOUT A KISSING BANDIT.

THERE IS NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE
A LITTLE TALK WITH YOU.

EXCUSE ME,
YOUR EXCELLENCY,

485
00:27:05,992 --> 00:27:07,494
BUT YOU'RE CALLING ME
MAJOR GOMEZ

486
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,596
WHEN EVERYBODY KNOWS
I'M COLONEL GOMEZ.

00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:11,131
OH, NO.
NOT ANYMORE.

488
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:13,400
NOT AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
THIS AFTERNOON.

489
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,201
YOU ARE DEMOTED.

490
00:27:15,268 --> 00:27:16,269
WHY?

491
00:27:16,336 --> 00:27:18,171
BECAUSE YOU ARE IN
TERRIBLE TROUBLE.

492
00:27:18,238 --> 00:27:19,606
AM I?

493
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:22,909
MM-HMM.
A NEW TAX COLLECTOR IS
ON HIS WAY FROM SPAIN.

494
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:24,344
HE'LL BE HERE
ANY DAY NOW.

495
00:27:24,411 --> 00:27:26,179
BUT WE NEVER HAD
ANY TROUBLE WITH
TAX COLLECTORS.

496
00:27:26,246 --> 00:27:29,049
THEY COME FOR THE TAXES,
THEY DON'T GET THEM,
THEY GO BACK TO SPAIN.

497
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:30,617
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

498
00:27:30,684 --> 00:27:32,218
YES, BUT THIS TIME
THE KING HAS SENT

499
00:27:32,285 --> 00:27:34,120
HIS RIGHT-HAND MAN
COUNT BELMONTE,

500
00:27:34,187 --> 00:27:37,891
AND COUNT BELMONTE'S ORDERS
ARE TO BRING BACK

501
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:40,460
EITHER THE TAX MONEY
OR MY HEAD.

502
00:27:40,527 --> 00:27:43,329
BUT, GOVERNOR,
IF IT'S THE TAX
MONEY OR YOUR HEAD,

503
00:27:43,396 --> 00:27:44,898
HOW AM I IN TROUBLE?

504
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:47,033
NOT THAT I WOULDN'T BE
VERY SORRY, OF COURSE.

505
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,771
YOU'LL BE SORRY BECAUSE
WITH COUNT BELMONTE IS
A CERTAIN GENERAL TORRO

506
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:55,241
WHO IS THE HEAD
OF HIS MAJESTY'S
SECRET POLICE.

507
00:27:55,308 --> 00:27:58,078
AND GENERAL TORRO IS
COMING HERE TO SEE

508
00:27:58,144 --> 00:28:01,014
HOW MUCH LAW AND ORDER
THERE IS IN CALIFORNIA.

509
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:03,183
AND THERE ISN'T ANY--

510
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:07,420
NO LAW, NO ORDER,
JUST PLENTY OF BANDITS.

511
00:28:07,487 --> 00:28:08,855
THAT'S PRETTY
TERRIBLE.

512
00:28:08,922 --> 00:28:11,624
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
GENERAL TORRO IS
GOING TO WITH YOU

513
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:15,662
IF HE GETS HERE
BEFORE YOU CAPTURE
THE KISSING BANDIT?

514
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:17,464
HE'S GOING TO TAKE YOU
BACK TO SPAIN

515
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,700
AND PUT YOU IN A LITTLE,
DARK DUNGEON...

WITH RATS.

517
00:28:22,736 --> 00:28:24,337
THEN ONE DAY A MAN

ANY TROUBLE WITH

NO.

522
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:32,712

I'D BETTER GO ALONG NOW.

ANY MORE OF IT.

ALL RIGHT?

00:28:44,524 --> 00:28:45,792
DID SHE TELL YOU
EVERYTHING?

530
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:47,193
OF COURSE
SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

531
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,795

SHE TOLD ME

AND, UH, MUSICIANS,
GO OVER THIS...

00:56:27,721 --> 00:56:29,923
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU ARE ALL RIGHT
WHERE YOU ARE.

00:56:29,989 --> 00:56:33,960
AND DON'T FORGET, NOW,
PLAY LOUD AND LONG.

943
00:56:36,096 --> 00:56:37,931
NOT LONG. SHORT!

944
00:56:37,997 --> 00:56:39,866
AND I SAY SHORT,
I MEAN--

YOU ARE DEMOTED!

947
00:56:42,335 --> 00:56:43,670
WELL, WHY?
WHAT DID I DO NOW?

948
00:56:43,737 --> 00:56:46,473
NOTHING.
THAT'S FOR NOTHING,
LIEUTENANT GOMEZ.

949
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:51,444
IS THAT RIGHT,

950
00:56:51,511 --> 00:56:53,813
THEY'RE COMING.
THEY'RE COMING!

951
00:57:01,855 --> 00:57:03,123

KNOW HOW TO ACT.

00:57:12,065 --> 00:57:13,400
THEY WON'T BE FOOLED.

955
00:57:13,466 --> 00:57:15,735
THEY'LL TAKE ONE LOOK
AT ME AND SHOOT.

HOW GENTLEMEN ACT.

I'VE SEEN MANY OF
THEM IN THE HOTELS
WHERE I HAVE WORKED.

IT'S A SALUTE
IN OUR HONOR.

00:57:35,922 --> 00:57:37,357
IN OUR FACES!

IT MAY BE DYING.

967
00:57:48,501 --> 00:57:50,303
THIS IS A VERY
CHARMING ROOM.

968
00:57:52,339 --> 00:57:53,606
Jose: AND NOW,

UH, TERESA, UH...

DON'T YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY TO OUR GUESTS?

00:58:35,815 --> 00:58:37,450
Chico: B-BUT
SHE DON'T NEED TO.

981

THANK YOU, UH...

IT'S A GREAT HONOR TO MEET YOU,

DON'T YOU, DEAR? HMM?

985
00:58:52,932 --> 00:58:54,501
IT'S A GREAT HONOR.

986
00:58:54,567 --> 00:58:57,804
UH, PERHAPS THE SENORITA
HAD IMAGINED ME AS BEING
QUITE DIFFERENT.

987
00:58:57,871 --> 00:58:59,472
Jose: VERY DIFFERENT.

988
00:58:59,539 --> 00:59:02,809
AND THE DIFFERENCE IS
VERY PLEASANT,

ISN'T IT, DARLING?

990

TO HAVE YOU
UNDER MY ROOF.

1004
00:59:45,985 --> 00:59:48,088
WHAT WAS THAT?

1005
00:59:48,154 --> 00:59:49,289
OH, A JOKE.

1006
00:59:51,925 --> 00:59:53,593
A FAMILY JOKE.

1007
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:54,861
A VERY
FUNNY ONE.

1008
00:59:54,928 --> 00:59:56,696
Chico:
IF THE JOKE IS FINISHED,

1009
00:59:56,763 --> 00:59:59,065
YOU CAN TELL US
WHERE THE TAX MONEY IS, HUH?

1010
00:59:59,132 --> 01:00:00,300
NO.

1011
01:00:00,367 --> 01:00:01,801
NO?

1012

RIGHT AFTER
YOU HAVE ARRIVED,

1015

WHEN YOU ARE TIRED
AND WEARY FROM
YOUR JOURNEY.

1016
01:00:09,376 --> 01:00:10,610
CERTAINLY NOT.

1017
01:00:10,677 --> 01:00:13,413

ENTERTAINED.

FINE. FINE.

1027
01:01:22,282 --> 01:01:24,451
NOW WE CAN GO
AND GET THE TAXES, HUH?

1028
01:01:24,517 --> 01:01:27,320
TERESA, WHY DON'T
WE SHOW OUR GUESTS
THE REST OF THE HACIENDA?

1029
01:01:27,387 --> 01:01:28,555
WONDERFUL IDEA.

1030
01:01:28,621 --> 01:01:30,056
WHY DON'T YOU
SHOW THEM AROUND

1031

THE PARTERRE,
TERESA, SLOWLY?

1032
01:01:32,192 --> 01:01:34,894
I MEAN,
SO THEY CAN SEE
ALL THE FLOWERS.

1033
01:01:34,961 --> 01:01:36,563
Ricardo: YES,
WHY DON'T YOU, SENORITA?

1034
01:01:36,629 --> 01:01:37,897
WELL, I THINK
AUNT ISABELLA

1035
01:01:37,964 --> 01:01:39,299
BETTER COME
ALONG, TOO.

1036
01:01:39,366 --> 01:01:41,234
SHE KNOWS THE
LATIN NAMES OF
ALL THE FLOWERS,

1037
01:01:41,301 --> 01:01:42,335
DON'T YOU,
AUNT ISABELLA?

1038
01:01:42,402 --> 01:01:43,903
B-BUT'S SHE'S THE--

1039
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:45,405
COME ALONG,
GENERAL TORRO.

1040
01:01:45,472 --> 01:01:46,906
I AM COMING
RIGHT BACK.

1041
01:01:46,973 --> 01:01:48,942
HOW MANY FLOWERS
CAN THERE BE?

1042
01:01:59,019 --> 01:02:00,420
YOUR EXCELLENCY.

1043
01:02:00,487 --> 01:02:02,589
YOUR EXCELLENCY,
I'M VERY SUSPICIOUS
ABOUT SOMETHING,

1044
01:02:02,655 --> 01:02:05,692
AND IT'S ONE
OF YOUR GUESTS--
THAT GENERAL TORRO.

1045
01:02:05,759 --> 01:02:07,694
I HAVE A VERY
DEFINITE FEELING

1046
01:02:07,761 --> 01:02:09,462
I'VE SEEN HIM
SOMEWHERE BEFORE.

1047
01:02:09,529 --> 01:02:10,864
WHAT?

1048
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:12,766
OF COURSE,
I DON'T SUPPOSE

1049
01:02:12,832 --> 01:02:15,268
I COULD HAVE
SEEN HIM ANYWHERE,
COULD I?

1050
01:02:15,335 --> 01:02:19,272
AFTER ALL, WITH ME
IN CALIFORNIA
AND HIM IN SPAIN...

1051
01:02:19,339 --> 01:02:21,975
STILL, IT DOES SEEM
TO ME THAT I'VE SEEN
THAT FACE SOMEWHERE.

1052
01:02:22,042 --> 01:02:23,943
GOMEZ...

1053
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:26,212
WELL, I GUESS
I COULDN'T
HAVE SEEN IT

1054
01:02:26,279 --> 01:02:28,481
ANYWHERE
AFTER ALL, NO.

1055
01:02:28,548 --> 01:02:30,116
WELL, EXCUSE ME.

1056
01:02:30,183 --> 01:02:32,052
MAYBE THIS
OTHER FELLOW
WAS A RELATIVE.

1057
01:02:32,118 --> 01:02:33,386
SEEMS FUNNY
TO HAVE RELATIVES

1058
01:02:33,453 --> 01:02:35,321
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
LIKE THAT, THOUGH.

1059
01:02:35,388 --> 01:02:36,790
Isabella:
OH, GENERAL TORRO,

1060
01:02:36,856 --> 01:02:39,292
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW WONDERFUL IT IS
FOR A WOMAN LIKE ME--

1061
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,328
HERE IN THE WILDS
OF THIS TERRIBLE
CALIFORNIA--

1062
01:02:42,395 --> 01:02:43,897
TO MEET A MAN LIKE YOU.

1063
01:02:43,963 --> 01:02:45,398
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH CALIFORNIA?

1064
01:02:45,465 --> 01:02:48,401
OH, THE MEN HERE
HAVE NO CONVERSATION.

1065
01:02:48,468 --> 01:02:51,071
BUT YOU,
FRESH FROM SPAIN,

1066
01:02:51,137 --> 01:02:53,239
MUST KNOW ALL
THE LATEST GOSSIP.

1067
01:02:53,306 --> 01:02:56,276
TELL ME,
WHAT'S NEW IN MADRID?

1068
01:02:56,343 --> 01:02:58,678
MADRID? UH...

1069
01:02:58,745 --> 01:03:01,247
OH, THE MEN
ARE CHASING THE WOMEN,

1070
01:03:01,314 --> 01:03:04,017
THE WOMEN
ARE CHASING THE MEN
THE SAME AS ALL OVER.

1071
01:03:04,084 --> 01:03:06,953
AH, BUT THEY DO IT
DIFFERENTLY IN SPAIN.

1072
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:08,355
THEY DO? HOW?

1073
01:03:08,421 --> 01:03:10,023
Isabella:
AH, GENERAL.

1074
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:12,359
WHEN THE KING TOLD ME
I MUST COME TO CALIFORNIA,

1075
01:03:12,425 --> 01:03:14,527
I THOUGHT, "HOW DREARY.
HOW VERY DULL.

1076
01:03:14,594 --> 01:03:16,796
A LAND OF PEASANTS
AND PEONS."

1077
01:03:16,863 --> 01:03:18,031
STOP IT.

1078
01:03:18,098 --> 01:03:19,366
YOU CAN JUST
STOP BEING

1079
01:03:19,432 --> 01:03:20,934
COUNT BELMONTE
RIGHT NOW.

1080
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:22,869
DO YOU THINK
I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE,

1081
01:03:22,936 --> 01:03:25,805
YOU, YOU...
BANDIT, YOU?

1082
01:03:25,872 --> 01:03:27,273
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

1083
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:28,975
DID YOU COME
TO ROB MY FATHER,
IS THAT IT?

1084
01:03:29,042 --> 01:03:30,043
NO, NO.

1085
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:32,045
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE
GOING TO TELL ME

1086
01:03:32,112 --> 01:03:33,980
THAT YOU CAME HERE
JUST TO SEE ME.

1087
01:03:34,047 --> 01:03:35,915
WELL, YES.

1088
01:03:37,217 --> 01:03:38,551
OH, WHAT NONSENSE.

1089
01:03:38,618 --> 01:03:40,387
YOU HAD ME
IN YOUR POWER ONCE,

1090
01:03:40,453 --> 01:03:42,389
AND YOU--
YOU DIDN'T...

1091
01:03:42,455 --> 01:03:45,492
YOU MEAN...
I DIDN'T KISS YOU.

1092
01:03:45,558 --> 01:03:47,660
WHY DIDN'T YOU?

1093
01:03:47,727 --> 01:03:49,396
OH, ANYONE BUT YOU,
SENORITA.

1094
01:03:49,462 --> 01:03:51,197
YOU WERE SO LOVELY,
I JUST COULDN'T.

1095

YOU'D BETTER LEAVE

MY FATHER.

YOU HAVEN'T MET

NEEDS A WOMAN

OH, THAT'S SO TRUE.

1257

A LOVELY LADY
TO ENCOURAGE HIM,

IT'S PERFECTLY HORRIBLE

WELL, I DON'T.

THAT MARRIAGES SHOULD
NOT BE ARRANGED,

1274
01:13:22,535 --> 01:13:24,237
BUT SHOULD BE FOR LOVE.

01:23:22,602 --> 01:23:23,937
YOU'VE GOT COBWEBS
ON YOU!

1400
01:23:24,004 --> 01:23:26,439
BELIEVE ME,
THAT'S ALL I GOT ON ME.

1401
01:23:26,506 --> 01:23:29,776
THAT ROBBER,
THAT FINE GOVERNOR
OF CALIFORNIA--

1402
01:23:29,843 --> 01:23:32,078
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I FOUND
IN THE TREASURY?

1403
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:36,049
12 STINKING PESOS!

1404
01:23:36,116 --> 01:23:38,418
AND BELIEVE ME,
THEY LOOK HOMEMADE!

1405
01:23:41,021 --> 01:23:42,989
COME ON. NOW WE
GOTTA LEAVE HERE
FOR SURE!

1406
01:23:43,056 --> 01:23:44,224
WONDERFUL!

1407
01:23:44,290 --> 01:23:45,892
ONLY I'D LIKE TO
WAIT FOR TERESA.

1408
01:23:45,959 --> 01:23:47,527
OH, CHICO, I HOPE
SHE GOES WITH US.

1409
01:23:47,594 --> 01:23:49,129
WHY DO YOU WANT HER
TO GO WITH US?

1410
01:23:49,195 --> 01:23:50,797
YOU'VE HAD
ENOUGH TIME
TO KISS HER.

1411
01:23:50,864 --> 01:23:53,400
BUT I'M IN LOVE WITH HER.
I WANT TO MARRY HER.

1412
01:23:53,466 --> 01:23:54,868
I WANT HER
FOR A LIFETIME.

1413
01:23:54,934 --> 01:23:56,603
A LI...

1414
01:23:56,670 --> 01:23:57,871
LIFETIME?

1415
01:23:59,739 --> 01:24:02,342
OH, THAT'S--
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

1416
01:24:02,409 --> 01:24:04,778
THEN THERE'S ONLY
ONE THING TO DO.

1417
01:24:04,844 --> 01:24:06,179
GET ON YOUR HORSE,

1418
01:24:06,246 --> 01:24:08,615
RIDE AWAY FROM HERE,
NEVER SEE HER NO MORE.

1419
01:24:08,682 --> 01:24:10,450
OH, I COULDN'T DO THAT!

1420
01:24:10,517 --> 01:24:12,786
THEN I DON'T THINK
YOU LOVE HER TOO MUCH.

1421
01:24:12,852 --> 01:24:14,721
I--I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1422
01:24:21,928 --> 01:24:24,464
LITTLE ONE, IT'S TIME
TO REMEMBER SOMETHING.

1423
01:24:24,531 --> 01:24:26,199
YOU ARE A BANDIT!

1424
01:24:26,266 --> 01:24:27,867
AND THAT IS WHAT
YOU DECIDED TO BE, NO?

1425
01:24:27,934 --> 01:24:30,370
YES, BUT THERE'S
NOTHING THAT SAYS

1426
01:24:30,437 --> 01:24:32,205
A BANDIT CAN'T HAVE
A WIFE, CHICO.

1427
01:24:32,272 --> 01:24:34,307
WHY, IN ALL THE BOOKS
I'VE READ, IT JUST--

1428
01:24:34,374 --> 01:24:35,675
BOOKS!

1429
01:24:35,742 --> 01:24:38,378
THIS IS NOT A BOOK,
 RICARDO MIO.

1430
01:24:38,445 --> 01:24:40,380
THIS IS NOT A DREAM
YOU ARE DREAMING.

1431
01:24:40,447 --> 01:24:42,816
BUT THIS IS
YOUR LIFE NOW.

1432
01:24:42,882 --> 01:24:44,884
A BANDIT'S LIFE--

1433
01:24:44,951 --> 01:24:48,321
HARD, SOMETIMES
VERY SHORT.

1434
01:24:48,388 --> 01:24:50,457
BUT THERE ARE ALSO
GOOD THINGS IN
A BANDIT'S LIFE--

1435
01:24:50,523 --> 01:24:53,827
UH, FREEDOM,
EXCITEMENT,
AND ADVENTURE.

1436
01:24:53,893 --> 01:24:55,762
SURE, FOR YOU.

1437
01:24:55,829 --> 01:24:59,399
BUT FOR A GENTLE
YOUNG GIRL LIKE TERESA

1438
01:24:59,466 --> 01:25:02,335
TO SPEND HER LIFE
HIDING, RUNNING AWAY,

1439
01:25:02,402 --> 01:25:03,436
IN DANGER...

1440
01:25:03,503 --> 01:25:05,905
IS THAT WHAT
YOU WANT FOR HER?

1441
01:25:05,972 --> 01:25:07,707
NO, NO.
OF COURSE NOT.

1442
01:25:07,774 --> 01:25:09,109
SURE NOT.

1443
01:25:10,744 --> 01:25:11,778
IT'S FUNNY.

1444
01:25:13,246 --> 01:25:14,748
BECAUSE I'M A BANDIT CHIEF,

1445
01:25:14,814 --> 01:25:16,583
I WAS ABLE TO WIN
MY HEROINE.

1446
01:25:16,649 --> 01:25:18,351
AND BECAUSE
I'M A BANDIT CHIEF,

1447
01:25:18,418 --> 01:25:19,619
I HAVE TO GIVE HER UP.

1448
01:25:22,155 --> 01:25:24,190
I REALIZE I HAVE
NO RIGHT TO HER, CHICO.

1449
01:25:24,257 --> 01:25:25,792
LET'S GO.

1450

[APPLAUSE]

1476
01:27:59,612 --> 01:28:01,581
LITTLE ONE, COME ON.
LET US GET OUT.

1477
01:28:03,183 --> 01:28:04,718
Isabella:
GENERAL TORRO,
THIS IS THE MOMENT

1478
01:28:04,784 --> 01:28:06,319
FOR WHICH I'VE BEEN
WAITING AND WAITING.

1479
01:28:06,386 --> 01:28:07,320
BUT WE GOT BUSINESS--

1480
01:28:07,387 --> 01:28:08,555
LET US DANCE.

1481
01:28:08,621 --> 01:28:10,256
BUT I DON'T DANCE
TOO GOOD.

1482
01:28:12,892 --> 01:28:14,494
DARLING!

1483
01:28:14,561 --> 01:28:15,895
TERESA, I--

1484
01:28:15,962 --> 01:28:17,997
WHAT I WANTED
TO SAY WAS THAT

1485
01:28:18,064 --> 01:28:20,900
I'LL GO AWAY
WITH YOU NOW.

1486
01:28:20,967 --> 01:28:22,502
THAT IS, IF YOU
STILL WANT ME TO.

1487
01:28:22,569 --> 01:28:25,405
TERESA, UH...

1488
01:28:25,472 --> 01:28:28,041
I'M A BANDIT, AND MAYBE
YOU OUGHT TO REALIZE--

1489
01:28:28,108 --> 01:28:29,843
I WOULDN'T HAVE YOU
ANY OTHER WAY.

1490
01:28:29,909 --> 01:28:31,211
SHALL WE GO?

1491
01:28:34,047 --> 01:28:37,917
UH, TERESA,
WOULD YOU DANCE WITH ME,
JUST THIS ONCE?

1492
01:28:39,419 --> 01:28:40,854
ALL RIGHT.

1493
01:29:05,211 --> 01:29:06,379
AH, GENERAL,

1494
01:29:06,446 --> 01:29:08,481
YOUR DANCING IS
JUST LIKE YOU ARE--

1495
01:29:08,548 --> 01:29:09,649
COMPLICATED.

1496
01:29:09,716 --> 01:29:11,051
YES, I THINK SO.

1497
01:29:17,457 --> 01:29:18,992
HELLO.
HOW ARE YOU?

1498
01:29:19,059 --> 01:29:20,927
I KNOW THAT FACE FROM--

1499
01:29:27,233 --> 01:29:28,435
AIEE!

1500
01:29:29,569 --> 01:29:31,738
Man: STOP! STOP!

1501
01:29:31,805 --> 01:29:33,840
STOP EVERYTHING,
IN THE KING'S NAME!

1502
01:29:33,907 --> 01:29:35,709
I AM COUNT BELMONTE.

1503
01:29:35,775 --> 01:29:37,777
GUARDS, THOSE TWO MEN
ARE IMPOSTORS. SEIZE THEM!

1504
01:29:40,246 --> 01:29:41,614
WHERE IS THE GOVERNOR?

1505
01:29:41,681 --> 01:29:43,049
WHERE IS THE GOVERNOR?

1506
01:29:43,116 --> 01:29:44,918
WHERE IS THE GOVERNOR,
I SAY?

1507
01:29:44,984 --> 01:29:47,420
I-I'M DON JOSE,
THE GOVERNOR.

1508
01:29:47,487 --> 01:29:49,622
YOU'VE MADE A MISTAKE
THAT MAY COST YOU
YOUR HEAD.

1509
01:29:51,224 --> 01:29:54,427
YOU'RE JUST
WHAT I EXPECTED
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

1510
01:29:54,494 --> 01:29:58,098
SEND ALL THESE PEOPLE HOME--
EVERYBODY. GET RID OF THEM.

1511
01:29:58,164 --> 01:29:59,566
BRING THOSE TWO MEN HERE!

1512
01:30:02,769 --> 01:30:04,437
LOOK AT THIS MAN,
GOVERNOR.

1513
01:30:04,504 --> 01:30:06,706
THIS, YOU FOOL,
IS THE MAN KNOWN AS
THE KISSING BANDIT;

1514
01:30:06,773 --> 01:30:08,375
THE OTHER,
HIS CHIEF ACCOMPLICE.

1515
01:30:08,441 --> 01:30:11,011
GUARDS, TAKE THEM AWAY!
THROW THEM IN CHAINS!

1516
01:30:11,077 --> 01:30:13,079
HAVE A GALLOWS BUILT!
HANG THEM!

1517
01:30:16,449 --> 01:30:17,717
OH, COUNT BELMONTE,
PLEASE.

1518
01:30:17,784 --> 01:30:19,486
YOU CAN'T HANG THEM.
YOU JUST CAN'T!

1519
01:30:19,552 --> 01:30:20,653
AND WHO IS THIS?

1520
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:22,722
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER TERESA.

1521
01:30:22,789 --> 01:30:25,525
SHE IS VERY PLEASED TO WELCOME
YOUR EXCELLENCY.

1522
01:30:25,592 --> 01:30:28,228
IF THE SENORITA
WOULD HONOR ME

1523
01:30:28,294 --> 01:30:29,796
WITH HER PRESENCE
FOR A WHILE,

1524
01:30:29,863 --> 01:30:32,499
I MIGHT BE INCLINED
TO FEEL MORE KINDLY
TOWARD HER FATHER

1525
01:30:32,565 --> 01:30:34,901
AND THIS ENTIRE,
DISGRACEFUL SITUATION.

1526
01:30:34,968 --> 01:30:37,671
OH, SH-SHE WOULD
BE DELIGHTED.

1527
01:30:37,737 --> 01:30:39,406
WOULDN'T YOU, DEAR?

1528
01:30:39,472 --> 01:30:41,274
SHE WOULD BE
DELIGHTED.

1529
01:30:43,476 --> 01:30:45,278
Belmonte:
HANG THE BANDITS AT DAWN.

1530
01:30:48,481 --> 01:30:49,983
AHEM. GREETINGS,
GENTLEMEN.

1531
01:30:50,050 --> 01:30:52,419
Chico: WHAT ARE YOU
SO HAPPY ABOUT?

1532
01:30:52,485 --> 01:30:54,087
WELL, I'VE BEEN
DEMOTED TO PRIVATE.

1533
01:30:54,154 --> 01:30:55,922
NOW, THAT MAY SOUND
BAD TO YOU,

1534
01:30:55,989 --> 01:30:58,191
BUT I JUST FOUND OUT
THAT PRIVATES ARE
THE ONLY ONES

1535
01:30:58,258 --> 01:30:59,526
THE GOVERNOR
CAN AFFORD TO PAY.

1536
01:30:59,592 --> 01:31:01,194
SO NOW,
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

1537
01:31:01,261 --> 01:31:03,363
I'M GETTING MONEY
FOR BEING IN THE ARMY.

1538
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:05,832
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT
FOR YOUR LAST SUPPER?

1539
01:31:05,899 --> 01:31:07,867
I DON'T WANT
NOTHING.

1540
01:31:07,934 --> 01:31:09,436
BUT WHAT DO
YOU WANT, GOMEZ?

1541
01:31:09,502 --> 01:31:11,938
BECAUSE MAYBE
THIS IS YOUR
LAST SUPPER, TOO.

1542
01:31:12,005 --> 01:31:14,808
YOU'RE IN PRETTY
MUCH HOT WATER,
AREN'T YOU?

1543
01:31:14,874 --> 01:31:17,310
I AM? AGAIN?

1544
01:31:17,377 --> 01:31:19,045
DON'T YOU THINK SO?

1545
01:31:19,112 --> 01:31:21,881
WHY, NO.
WHAT HAVE I DONE NOW?

1546
01:31:21,948 --> 01:31:24,551
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE KING IS GONNA SAY

1547
01:31:24,617 --> 01:31:26,386
WHEN HE FINDS OUT
YOU THREW ME,

1548
01:31:26,453 --> 01:31:28,388
THE CHIEF OF POLICE,
IN JAIL?

1549
01:31:28,455 --> 01:31:30,123
AND ME--
COUNT BELMONTE?

1550
01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:32,158
BUT YOU'RE NOT.
YOU'RE JUST IMPERSONATING
THESE PEOPLE, THAT'S ALL.

1551
01:31:32,225 --> 01:31:33,393
WHO SAID THAT?

1552
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:34,494
OH, EVERYBODY'S
TALKING ABOUT IT.

1553
01:31:34,561 --> 01:31:35,895
DON'T BELIEVE IT.

1554
01:31:35,962 --> 01:31:38,398
BUT YOU'RE NOT GENERAL TORRO
AND COUNT BELMONTE, ARE YOU?

1555
01:31:38,465 --> 01:31:39,899
WEREN'T WE
INTRODUCED TO YOU

1556
01:31:39,966 --> 01:31:41,801
BY THE GOVERNOR AS
BELMONTE AND TORRO?

1557
01:31:41,868 --> 01:31:43,970
DO YOU THINK
THE GOVERNOR
WOULD LIE TO YOU?

1558
01:31:44,037 --> 01:31:46,906
THAT'S A TERRIBLE
THING TO SAY ABOUT
THE GOVERNOR.

1559
01:31:46,973 --> 01:31:48,408
I DON'T LIKE YOUR
ATTITUDE, GOMEZ.

1560
01:31:48,475 --> 01:31:50,143
I'D BE MORE CAREFUL
IF I WERE YOU.

1561
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:52,812
PLEASE,
PUT DOWN THE KEYS.
THEY MAKE ME NERVOUS.

1562
01:31:52,879 --> 01:31:54,914
EVERYTHING WAS
ALL CLEAR TO ME UNTIL
A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

1563
01:31:54,981 --> 01:31:56,616
WELL, LISTEN TO ME,
AND WE'LL CLEAR IT
ALL UP FOR YOU.

1564
01:31:56,683 --> 01:31:58,084
IT'S ALL VERY SIMPLE.

1565
01:31:58,151 --> 01:31:59,853
IT'S REALLY
NOT DIFFICULT TO
UNDERSTAND AT ALL.

1566
01:31:59,919 --> 01:32:01,354
WE TAKE CARE OF
EVERYTHING.

1567
01:32:01,421 --> 01:32:02,856
WHEN WE FIRST
GOT HERE, YOU SEE...

1568
01:32:02,922 --> 01:32:04,557
YOU'LL HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

1569
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:08,361
NOW, DON'T GO
NOPLACE.

1570
01:32:08,428 --> 01:32:10,897
Gomez: LOOK, THE GOVERNOR
WON'T LIKE THIS AT ALL.

1571
01:32:20,607 --> 01:32:22,308
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
GO ON, GO ON!

1572
01:32:22,375 --> 01:32:23,476
LOOK!

1573
01:32:28,481 --> 01:32:30,884
SHE SHOULDN'T BE ALONE
WITH A MAN LIKE HIM!

1574
01:32:30,950 --> 01:32:33,486
BUT IT'S NOT OUR
BUSINESS. GO ON!

1575
01:32:36,122 --> 01:32:37,524
THIS IS MY BUSINESS!

1576
01:32:37,590 --> 01:32:39,759
Chico: AIEE!

1577
01:32:48,802 --> 01:32:51,404
THAT'LL TEACH YOU
TO STAY AWAY FROM MY GIRL.

1578
01:32:51,471 --> 01:32:53,406
AND YOU OUGHT TO BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELF!

1579
01:32:53,473 --> 01:32:56,509
Belmonte: TORRO! DON JOSE!
CALL OUT THE GUARDS!

1580
01:32:56,576 --> 01:32:59,212
TORRO! TORRO!

1581
01:33:02,148 --> 01:33:04,184
STAY OUT
OF THIS, CHICO.
THIS IS MY AFFAIR.

1582
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:06,553
TORRO, DRAW YOUR SWORD
AND CUT THESE MEN TO RIBBONS!

1583
01:33:10,423 --> 01:33:13,493
YOU STAY OUT,
AND THEY STAY OUT!

1584
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:15,528
TERESA, YOU'D BETTER
GO INSIDE.

1585
01:33:15,595 --> 01:33:17,297
THIS IS NO PLACE
FOR A LADY.

1586
01:33:17,364 --> 01:33:19,299
VERY WELL, RICARDO.

1587
01:33:19,366 --> 01:33:20,867
NOW, ARE YOU READY?

1588
01:33:20,934 --> 01:33:23,470
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS!
I DON'T FIGHT PEASANTS!

1589
01:33:23,536 --> 01:33:24,738
PUT UP YOUR FISTS!

1590
01:33:26,873 --> 01:33:28,074
HOW UNFAIR!

1591
01:33:31,978 --> 01:33:33,380
HOLD IT! STOP IT!

1592
01:33:33,446 --> 01:33:35,015
I THOUGHT
THEY WERE IN JAIL!

1593
01:33:37,684 --> 01:33:39,819
YOU DON'T WANT TO
HELP COUNT BELMONTE.

1594
01:33:39,886 --> 01:33:42,222
WELL, I...NO.

1595
01:33:42,288 --> 01:33:44,891
BUT I SHOULDN'T HELP
A MAN WHO IS A BANDIT.

1596
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:47,160
IT'LL BE MUCH BETTER
IF HE WINS.

1597
01:33:47,227 --> 01:33:49,329
WELL, I-I...

1598
01:33:49,396 --> 01:33:50,730
AH, GENERAL.

1599
01:33:50,797 --> 01:33:53,099
I MEAN...
MR. BANDIT.

1600
01:33:56,903 --> 01:33:59,039
BUT EVEN IF
RICARDO WINS,

1601
01:33:59,105 --> 01:34:00,407
HE'S STILL
A BANDIT.

1602
01:34:00,473 --> 01:34:02,008
SURELY YOU CAN
PARDON HIM,
CAN'T YOU?

1603
01:34:02,075 --> 01:34:03,376
YOU'RE THE GOVERNOR,
AREN'T YOU?

1604
01:34:07,647 --> 01:34:10,417
THAT STILL LEAVES
THE PROBLEM OF BELMONTE.

1605
01:34:10,483 --> 01:34:13,186
YOU COULD ORDER HIM
OUT OF THE TERRITORY,
COULDN'T YOU?

1606
01:34:13,253 --> 01:34:15,021
HE GOES BACK
WITHOUT THE TAXES,

1607
01:34:15,088 --> 01:34:16,690
ALFONSO WILL
CUT OFF HIS HEAD.

1608
01:34:16,756 --> 01:34:17,757
WHAT ARE YOU
WORRIED ABOUT?

1609
01:34:27,534 --> 01:34:28,568
AIEE!

1610
01:34:29,936 --> 01:34:31,538
WHY DON'T YOU
APPOINT SOMEONE

1611
01:34:31,604 --> 01:34:33,139
TO COLLECT THE MONEY
FOR YOU?

1612
01:34:33,206 --> 01:34:35,075
WHOM?

1613
01:34:35,141 --> 01:34:38,478
YOU HAVE A MAN
RIGHT OVER HERE WHO
HAS MORE EXPERIENCE

1614
01:34:38,545 --> 01:34:41,715
COLLECTING MONEY
THAN ANYONE ELSE
IN CALIFORNIA.

1615
01:34:41,781 --> 01:34:43,049
I DON'T WANT
THE JOB.

1616
01:34:43,116 --> 01:34:44,551
THERE'LL BE
A COMMISSION.

1617
01:34:44,617 --> 01:34:45,985
THEN MAYBE
I'LL TAKE IT.

1618
01:34:46,052 --> 01:34:47,220
YOU'RE HIRED.

1619
01:34:47,287 --> 01:34:48,455
THERE'S MY MAN
TO HELP YOU.

1620
01:34:48,521 --> 01:34:50,323
I DON'T WANT
YOUR MAN.
I GOT MY OWN.

1621
01:34:50,390 --> 01:34:51,424
IT'S A DEAL.

1622
01:35:14,647 --> 01:35:15,815
WELL, JOSE,

1623
01:35:15,882 --> 01:35:17,450
YOU ARE
THE GOVERNOR,
AREN'T YOU?

1624
01:35:22,322 --> 01:35:25,859
BELMONTE, GET OUT
OF CALIFORNIA!

1625
01:35:25,925 --> 01:35:27,360
I'M THE GOVERNOR!

1626
01:35:27,427 --> 01:35:29,329
FINE, LITTLE ONE.

1627
01:35:29,396 --> 01:35:31,765
Torro: COME ON.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

1628
01:35:31,831 --> 01:35:36,002
THIS CALIFORNIA CLIMATE
DON'T AGREE WITH YOU, EITHER.

1629
01:35:36,069 --> 01:35:39,339
Isabella: I THINK
YOU'LL FIND TERESA
WAITING FOR YOU INSIDE.

1630
01:35:39,406 --> 01:35:41,941
THANK YOU,
DONA ISABELLA,
BUT I CAN'T STAY.

1631
01:35:42,008 --> 01:35:43,443
IF SHE CARED
FOR ME AT ALL,

1632
01:35:43,510 --> 01:35:45,111
IT WAS BECAUSE
I WAS A BANDIT.

1633
01:35:45,178 --> 01:35:46,946
I'M NO LONGER
A BANDIT.

1634
01:35:47,013 --> 01:35:49,949
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'M GOING UP TO PACK.

1635
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:51,785
RUN AFTER HIM,
CHICO.

1636
01:35:51,851 --> 01:35:53,286
MAKE HIM
CHANGE HIS MIND.

1637
01:35:53,353 --> 01:35:55,555
AFTER ALL, YOU'VE BEEN
OUTLAWS TOGETHER.

1638
01:35:55,622 --> 01:35:57,657
WHY NOT IN-LAWS
TOGETHER?

1639
01:35:57,724 --> 01:35:58,758
YE-YEAH.

1640
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:01,094
TOGETHER?

1641
01:36:04,631 --> 01:36:06,332
Y-YOU CANNOT DO IT,
LITTLE ONE.

1642
01:36:06,399 --> 01:36:07,834
YOU CANNOT GO AWAY.

1643
01:36:07,901 --> 01:36:09,135
I'M SORRY, CHICO.

1644
01:36:09,202 --> 01:36:11,171
I'M GOING
BACK TO BOSTON.
I MADE UP MY MIND.

1645
01:36:11,237 --> 01:36:12,605
PLEASE, RICARDO.

1646
01:36:14,374 --> 01:36:17,243
GO DOWNSTAIRS
AND TALK TO
TERESA FIRST.

1647
01:36:17,310 --> 01:36:19,112
NO, CHICO.
IT'S ALL OVER WITH.

1648
01:36:19,179 --> 01:36:22,349
THEN THINK OF ME.
I'M IN TERRIBLE TROUBLE.

1649
01:36:22,415 --> 01:36:24,918
I CANNOT FACE IT ALONE!

1650
01:36:24,984 --> 01:36:27,420
IT'S THAT--
THAT ISABELLA.

1651
01:36:27,487 --> 01:36:30,423
I AM AFRAID
I AM ENGAGED.

1652
01:36:30,490 --> 01:36:32,692
OH, IT'S...
FINE NEWS, CHICO.

1653
01:36:32,759 --> 01:36:33,860
I DON'T KNOW.

1654
01:36:33,927 --> 01:36:35,095
CONGRATULATIONS.

1655
01:36:35,161 --> 01:36:37,597
FOR ME, THERE'S
NOTHING, I GUESS--

1656
01:36:37,664 --> 01:36:40,400
NO MORE ADVENTURE,
NO MORE ROMANCE...

1657
01:36:40,467 --> 01:36:47,073
Teresa:
^^ IF YOU'LL STILL KISS ME ^^

1658
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:55,682
^^ I HOPE YOU'LL RETURN HERE
SOME DAY ^^

1659
01:36:55,749 --> 01:37:02,789

MY DREAMS, DEAR ^^

1660
01:37:02,856 --> 01:37:04,391
^^ PLEASE GIVE THEM BACK... ^^

1661
01:37:04,457 --> 01:37:07,761
TERESA, YOU DON'T
SEEM TO UNDERSTAND!

1662
01:37:07,827 --> 01:37:10,897
^^ SOME WAY ^^

1663
01:37:10,964 --> 01:37:19,072
^^ IF YOU TAKE MY MIDNIGHT ^^

1664
01:37:19,139 --> 01:37:24,244
^^ PLEASE BRING IT BACK
WITH THE DAWN... ^^

1665
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:26,179
THERE'S SOMETHING
I MUST TELL YOU!

1666
01:37:26,246 --> 01:37:34,154
^^ BUT IF YOU STEAL
MY HEART, DEAR ^^

1667
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:41,861
^^ I'LL KNOW IT'S GONE ^^

1668
01:37:41,928 --> 01:37:48,768
^^ FOREVER GONE ^^

1669
01:37:50,403 --> 01:37:52,539
TERESA, LOOK,
I'VE GOT TO MAKE
THIS CLEAR TO YOU.

1670
01:37:52,605 --> 01:37:54,207
I AM NOT A BANDIT.

1671
01:37:54,274 --> 01:37:55,975
MY FATHER WAS
THE KISSING BANDIT.

1672
01:37:56,042 --> 01:37:57,610
I WAS NEVER A BANDIT.

1673
01:37:57,677 --> 01:38:00,347
I COULDN'T BE A BANDIT
IN A MILLION YEARS.

1674
01:38:00,413 --> 01:38:03,483
I-I DIDN'T INHERIT
ONE SINGLE THING
FROM MY FATHER--

1675
01:38:03,550 --> 01:38:07,420
NOT ONE SINGLE THING.

1676
01:38:11,758 --> 01:38:12,959
AIEE!

1677
01:38:16,396 --> 01:38:17,931
MMM...

1678
01:38:26,406 --> 01:38:27,607
OR DID I?
