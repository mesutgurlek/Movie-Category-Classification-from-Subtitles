1
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,256
Anita!

2
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:35,561
Coming.

3
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:38,002
Ready? Open the door!

4
00:00:40,342 --> 00:00:44,803
Oh, I've been saving up
for you for a long time!

5
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:57,387
Come on, honey!

6
00:00:57,495 --> 00:01:00,021
I'm a-waiting!

7
00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:04,899
Happy birthday, Colonel.

8
00:01:08,275 --> 00:01:10,573
Oh, darlin', darlin'.

9
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:16,643
Let's raise the flag
on the flagpole today, huh?

10
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:20,346
You know the rules.
No sidearms upstairs.

11
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:22,890
Birthday kiss. Yeah.

12
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:25,824
Take off your coat and stay awhile.

13
00:01:25,995 --> 00:01:28,260
Come on, darlin'.

14
00:01:28,365 --> 00:01:30,196
- A toast.
- A toast?

15
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:32,358
- A toast.
- Yeah, give me a drink. Sure.

16
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:35,998
Oh, you're such a pig.

17
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:39,704
Ah, yeah! Oink, oink, oink!

18
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:43,543
- You're one of the best.
- One year better and one year older.

19
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:48,947
Now, darlin',
what do you say, huh?

20
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:52,356
We're here to have a good time.
Come on! Come on!

21
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:56,964
I'll grab you, all right!

22
00:01:57,133 --> 00:01:59,033
Come here, you. Here I go.

23
00:02:01,303 --> 00:02:05,570
- Whoo.
- That kiss now.

24
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,905
- You don't want to do business with me, Colonel.
- I want that kiss!

25
00:02:21,227 --> 00:02:23,388
Where you goin'?

26
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:29,999
- There they go again.
- What the hell's goin' on?

27
00:02:51,529 --> 00:02:54,363
God-fearin' citizens of this fine town...

28
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:57,798
...ain't it about time we stop lettin'...

29
00:02:57,903 --> 00:03:01,601
...the sad morality
of a pernicious few sinners...

30
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:04,073
...bring shame upon us all?

31
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:07,943
Time to put a stop to the drinkin'...

32
00:03:08,115 --> 00:03:10,208
- Yeah!
- And the gamblin'...

33
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,447
And the whorin'...

34
00:03:13,555 --> 00:03:15,853
...right under our very noses.

35
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,120
Hey, preacher. You come up here.

36
00:03:18,228 --> 00:03:20,287
We think we might could
change your mind.

37
00:03:33,178 --> 00:03:35,943
Man's entitled to a drink
every once in a while.

38
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,583
My father, he'd have his drink
on Saturday nights.

39
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:42,348
Worked hard all week long.
There's nothing wrong with that.

40
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,047
They say it says in the Bible...

41
00:04:01,077 --> 00:04:03,069
You had two already.

42
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,377
Whoa! Hold on there! Where are you going?
We didn't finish yet.

43
00:04:06,484 --> 00:04:09,511
- You've had too much to drink.
- I ain't got my birthday kiss yet.

44
00:04:09,621 --> 00:04:11,919
You're gonna plant it
right here, honey.

45
00:04:12,057 --> 00:04:16,358
You... Come on now.
I'm gonna take you to...

46
00:04:19,465 --> 00:04:22,060
- It's all right. Come on.
- Come on, darlin'...

47
00:04:23,904 --> 00:04:26,135
- That's the one I wanted.
- Oh, boy.

48
00:04:28,243 --> 00:04:31,041
- You stay away from me.
- No, whore!

49
00:04:31,212 --> 00:04:33,306
Cody! Cody!

50
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:36,180
- Help me!
- Damn whore!

51
00:04:39,056 --> 00:04:41,616
Now keep your hands off her, Colonel.

52
00:04:41,758 --> 00:04:46,787
I paid for a goddamn birthday kiss!
I'm gonna get one!

53
00:04:46,898 --> 00:04:50,665
You touch her again, you're a dead man.

54
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:14,393
She shot him!

55
00:05:14,497 --> 00:05:17,763
The whore shot the colonel!
Get her!

56
00:05:17,868 --> 00:05:20,166
Harlot! Get her!

57
00:05:20,304 --> 00:05:24,571
She shot the colonel! She shot him!
Get her! Get her!

58
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,223
You okay?

59
00:06:17,838 --> 00:06:21,434
The good Lord sayeth
an eye for an eye, a life for a life.

60
00:06:21,576 --> 00:06:23,976
Lord, let this jezebel
be damned to death!

61
00:06:24,112 --> 00:06:27,480
Harlot, you cannot escape
the wrath of our Lord!

62
00:06:27,616 --> 00:06:30,210
I accuse you ofharlotry.

63
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:33,754
I accuse you of destroying
the sanctity of marriage.

64
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:37,690
I accuse you ofbringing sin
and disease to this town.

65
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:41,457
You have blackened the sun
and bloodied the moon!

66
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:45,058
- String her up.
- I accuse you of having a scorpion between your legs...

67
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:49,471
...that destroys man's covenant with God!

68
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,703
Cleanse yourself with death!

69
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,109
Free yourself from
your sinful enslavement!

70
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:55,910
Just get on with it.

71
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,483
And let us pray.

72
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:01,180
O God...

73
00:07:01,323 --> 00:07:03,223
Jesus has said...

74
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:05,985
...every tree is known by its fruits.

75
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:10,155
This woman has
brought forth bad fruit.

76
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:13,100
And we pray unto you today, Lord,
to bless us...

77
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,704
- As we rid our fair community of this woman.
- Hyah! Hyah!

78
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:18,365
This abomination.
This scarlet temptress...

79
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,273
- who is ruining our town.
- Get out of the way!

80
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:24,041
I say unto her, the day of wrath is at hand.

81
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:28,953
Seems more like a lifetime
than three years.

82
00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:31,893
I'm not exactly...

83
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,460
...your blushing bride anymore.

84
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:41,398
I know you don't
hold it against me, but I do.

85
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:47,106
At least I never let
another man kiss me.

86
00:08:55,122 --> 00:08:57,216
I'll always have you in my heart.

87
00:08:58,526 --> 00:09:00,653
If nothing else, at least that's sacred.

88
00:09:00,762 --> 00:09:04,529
Let's go. If we don't put ground between us
and Echo City, we won't be going anywhere.

89
00:09:17,215 --> 00:09:21,619
Hey there. We're with the Pinkerton
Detective Agency. Wonder if you could help us.

90
00:09:21,754 --> 00:09:25,247
We're looking for
a Miss Mathilda Clayborne.

91
00:09:25,392 --> 00:09:27,519
That's her in the buggy.

92
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:29,788
Thank you.

93
00:09:29,896 --> 00:09:32,058
But they...
They are way the hell...

94
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,498
...out of my jurisdiction
by now, Mrs. Clayborne.

95
00:09:34,669 --> 00:09:38,936
If you were anything more than a pile of
manure with a badge on it...

96
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,134
...my colonel might still be alive.

97
00:09:41,243 --> 00:09:44,077
Well, I didn't put no gun
to your mister's head...

98
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:46,340
...and make him jump that whore!

99
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:48,281
Bitch.

100
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:54,818
We came as soon as we got the wire, ma'am.
Sorry about your husband.

101
00:09:54,926 --> 00:10:00,297
You're wasting time. I'm hiring you because
what passes for the law around here...

102
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,731
...won't leave this jurisdiction.

103
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:07,000
I want that filthy harlot killed
or brought back to me, no matter what.

104
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,640
I had these drawn up.

105
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,476
That's just a taste of what you'll get
when you bring her back.

106
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,248
Sonny, you want to get our mounts off
the horsecar back of the train.

107
00:10:21,356 --> 00:10:23,222
- Yes, sir.
- Don't you worry, ma'am.

108
00:10:23,393 --> 00:10:27,854
You just point us which way they went.
We'll track 'em all right.

109
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:16,247
Okay. Lift it. Higher.

110
00:11:17,856 --> 00:11:19,586
Okay. Ease it down.

111
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:22,886
That should do it.

112
00:11:28,102 --> 00:11:29,592
Cody!

113
00:11:29,737 --> 00:11:32,468
The wagon!

114
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:35,769
You all right, sweet pea?

115
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:43,654
Well, might as well eat this too.

116
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:47,460
Yeah. You can't tell
the one meat from the other.

117
00:12:47,595 --> 00:12:51,362
Yeah, just like men.

118
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:55,962
So, are we gonna find
another saloon somewhere?

119
00:12:57,007 --> 00:12:58,599
I'm finished with that.

120
00:12:58,742 --> 00:13:01,108
So am I.

121
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:08,014
What have you got there?
Is that a stock certificate?

122
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:13,385
It's a homesteader's claim to 640 acres
in the Oregon Territory.

123
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:17,054
- Jim and I had it together. It's what we came out west for.
- What's it worth?

124
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:21,566
A lot of hard work, and then what you gotta
farm unless the bank takes it away.

125
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:23,329
We were gonna start a sawmill.

126
00:13:24,772 --> 00:13:26,001
A sawmill?

127
00:13:26,107 --> 00:13:28,598
Yeah. All the settling out here now...

128
00:13:28,743 --> 00:13:31,508
...means more schools and saloons,
churches, houses.

129
00:13:31,681 --> 00:13:36,209
- That means lumber.
- Now how come you never told us about this before?

130
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:38,753
I don't know. I...

131
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:41,449
I didn't know how I was gonna do it
all by myself.

132
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:45,926
What I mean to say is I'd like it if...

133
00:13:46,064 --> 00:13:47,929
...you-all would go in with me.

134
00:13:48,099 --> 00:13:50,568
Together we could do it.
We could run a business.

135
00:13:50,703 --> 00:13:52,534
A sawmill?

136
00:13:52,705 --> 00:13:56,039
We sold our bodies.
Why can't we sell some wood?

137
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:03,417
Might as well cook that thing some
more. Ain't gonna hurt to burn it none.

138
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,382
I suppose not.

139
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,715
Takes money.

140
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,856
Building a sawmill takes money.

141
00:14:12,996 --> 00:14:15,328
I know. I'm probably just dreaming...

142
00:14:15,465 --> 00:14:17,832
...but it's the closest thing
to a plan we've got.

143
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:20,436
Well, it could be I got some.

144
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:25,507
In Agua Dulce.
Been wiring it there for years.

145
00:14:25,643 --> 00:14:27,634
Over $12,000 now.

146
00:14:27,746 --> 00:14:29,612
Wha... Tw...

147
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:32,616
What are you saying?

148
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:35,220
I'm saying sawmill.

149
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,390
Why the hell not?

150
00:14:42,797 --> 00:14:46,495
Yeah. Why the hell not?

151
00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:57,644
A sawmill.

152
00:15:03,622 --> 00:15:06,682
Well, as long as I don't have to
get any splinters in my fingers.

153
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:08,384
Oh, Eileen.

154
00:15:12,465 --> 00:15:14,593
This stuff's... Raunchy.

155
00:15:14,735 --> 00:15:17,602
That's why they call it rotgut.

156
00:15:17,805 --> 00:15:21,003
Oh, it hits you quick.

157
00:15:33,824 --> 00:15:36,190
Maybe a day old.

158
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:38,625
They was pullin' a wagon.

159
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:41,425
If it don't rain, won't be hard
picking 'em up.

160
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:36,962
Morning, ma'am.

161
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:40,624
Now don't go firing that thing.
I just want to show you something.

162
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:49,269
I must say the likeness
doesn't do you justice.

163
00:16:56,787 --> 00:17:00,189
Yeah. That's me all right.

164
00:17:00,325 --> 00:17:02,623
Uh, my name's McCoy. Joshua McCoy.

165
00:17:02,761 --> 00:17:05,287
Where are you headed, Mr. McCoy?

166
00:17:05,464 --> 00:17:07,625
I'm a prospector, see.

167
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:11,295
These hills are too picked-over.
I... Thought I'd make my way up north.

168
00:17:11,471 --> 00:17:13,996
I've seen prospectors.
You don't look like a prospector.

169
00:17:14,174 --> 00:17:17,770
Oh, I am. Truly am.

170
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:22,816
I'm countin' on making a big strike soon.
Soon as I get some things taken care of.

171
00:17:23,018 --> 00:17:27,615
Now you wouldn't be thinking this reward
here would be part of your stake, would you?

172
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:33,622
No, ma'am. I'm just riding
in the same direction as you.

173
00:17:36,534 --> 00:17:39,766
All right. Put on your hat
and be on your way, Mr. McCoy.

174
00:17:41,173 --> 00:17:43,038
Only if you put your clothes on.

175
00:17:46,846 --> 00:17:49,407
- Get movin'.
- Ma'am.

176
00:17:53,787 --> 00:17:57,622
One more thing. They put Pinkertons
on your trail. You best keep movin'.

177
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:04,865
Pack everything on horseback.
We're leaving the wagon.

178
00:18:05,034 --> 00:18:06,832
What about all our things?

179
00:18:07,037 --> 00:18:09,665
Leave 'em. We gotta be
in Agua Dulce by tomorrow.

180
00:18:42,011 --> 00:18:44,206
- Yes. May I help you?
- Yeah.

181
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:47,347
I want to buy a dress.

182
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:50,748
Um, just what kind of dress
did you have in mind?

183
00:18:50,888 --> 00:18:54,017
One of them ready-to-wear kind
like you see in that Sears catalog.

184
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:58,358
I really think a woman like you would be
happier shopping someplace else.

185
00:19:05,305 --> 00:19:08,706
Hyah! Come on. Hyah!

186
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:42,211
Morning, ma'am.

187
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,624
Good day, Mr. Landaker.

188
00:19:59,702 --> 00:20:02,399
- I believe you dropped this, madam.
- Oh, why, thank you, sir.

189
00:20:02,572 --> 00:20:06,235
- My pleasure.
- I'm new here. If it wouldn't be too much trouble...

190
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,242
...could you suggest a respectable place...

191
00:20:08,446 --> 00:20:11,643
...where I might have a meal
and a decent libation?

192
00:20:11,783 --> 00:20:14,776
Now, I just might know of such a place.

193
00:20:19,225 --> 00:20:21,819
How dare you cast
such lewd and salacious aspersions...

194
00:20:21,995 --> 00:20:25,432
...upon my person.

195
00:20:25,566 --> 00:20:27,898
But that might be interesting.

196
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:30,129
Eileen, you don't gotta
whore yourself...

197
00:20:30,238 --> 00:20:32,331
...at the first old fart that comes along.

198
00:20:34,242 --> 00:20:36,609
- Silly child.
- Tramps, the both of you!

199
00:20:36,746 --> 00:20:39,112
Ah, Lilly!

200
00:20:39,248 --> 00:20:41,979
Can't you tell I...
I was just trying to get somethin'...

201
00:20:42,186 --> 00:20:44,017
...passable to eat.

202
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:46,621
Oh, yeah? And I'm Wyatt Earp.

203
00:20:46,757 --> 00:20:48,749
Can I have a kiss, Wyatt Earp?

204
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,728
- Don't you pucker up to me, Eileen.
- Come on. Come on.

205
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:03,973
Eileen.

206
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:19,124
Uh, well.

207
00:21:19,262 --> 00:21:21,526
How can I help you, madam?

208
00:21:21,665 --> 00:21:24,156
I would like to close out my account.

209
00:21:24,335 --> 00:21:27,601
Uh... Pardon me.
I... I don't believe I know you.

210
00:21:27,739 --> 00:21:29,570
You... You have an account with us?

211
00:21:29,774 --> 00:21:35,475
Oh, yes. I set it up six years ago,
and I've been wiring deposits ever since.

212
00:21:35,648 --> 00:21:37,843
Miss Anna Lee Zamora.

213
00:21:37,984 --> 00:21:40,078
Please come in, Miss Zamora.

214
00:21:40,187 --> 00:21:42,815
- Thank you.
- Just have a seat right over there.

215
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:46,850
Now then, uh...

216
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:50,192
...if you don't mind, could I just, uh, take
a look at your bankbook?

217
00:21:52,401 --> 00:21:54,232
Oh, I'm afraid
there's a bit of a problem.

218
00:21:54,436 --> 00:21:56,871
You see, we had a fire.

219
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,474
And it was terrible. I... I just...

220
00:21:59,643 --> 00:22:02,078
Well, I really can't say.

221
00:22:02,213 --> 00:22:06,616
Uh... I do recall signing
something some time ago.

222
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:09,880
You must have my signature
on file somewhere.

223
00:22:09,988 --> 00:22:13,048
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

224
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,776
Let's go in here.

225
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,676
- We're with the Pinkerton Detective Ag...
- I can see that.

226
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:36,216
We're following a harlot
name of Cody Zamora.

227
00:22:36,353 --> 00:22:39,379
She killed a fella up in Colorado Territory.

228
00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:42,789
- She's riding with a bunch of other whores.
- Yep. These are some bad girls.

229
00:22:42,927 --> 00:22:45,555
This one rode in this morning
with three others.

230
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:49,792
It's, uh, very unusual
to carry an account like this.

231
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:53,737
And, uh, there's
considerable funds in your account.

232
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,534
$12,432, I believe.

233
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:01,205
- Why, yes. A little more with the interest.
- How lovely.

234
00:23:01,382 --> 00:23:03,179
- Cody!
- Hold on.

235
00:23:03,384 --> 00:23:05,478
- Not now.
- You gotta listen to me. Excuse me.

236
00:23:05,587 --> 00:23:07,714
- See here, young lady.
- This is my sister.

237
00:23:09,992 --> 00:23:11,790
- Pinkertons!
- Lilly, get!

238
00:23:11,995 --> 00:23:13,826
She belongs to you, does she?

239
00:23:15,231 --> 00:23:17,097
It's all right, Jenkins.

240
00:23:17,301 --> 00:23:20,327
- It's all right.
- Yes, sir.

241
00:23:23,074 --> 00:23:26,100
I am so sorry.

242
00:23:27,212 --> 00:23:29,738
Oh. My sister, she's a little...

243
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,058
Nita, those Pinkertons. They're here.

244
00:23:44,499 --> 00:23:46,365
Come on.

245
00:23:53,143 --> 00:23:54,940
Here you go.

246
00:24:01,452 --> 00:24:04,047
Cody. Cody. The Pinkertons are comin'...

247
00:24:04,222 --> 00:24:06,247
Wrong, darlin'. The Pinkertons are here.

248
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:10,485
Miss Zamora, if you'd come with me.

249
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:15,496
- Get her.
- Come on.

250
00:24:16,704 --> 00:24:18,501
Get off of me!

251
00:24:18,706 --> 00:24:21,141
Cody!

252
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,155
Get up.

253
00:24:38,229 --> 00:24:40,094
Drop the gun.

254
00:24:40,298 --> 00:24:42,494
Drop it.

255
00:24:43,736 --> 00:24:46,000
You too.

256
00:24:46,138 --> 00:24:48,003
Move it!

257
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:51,405
Inside!

258
00:24:51,544 --> 00:24:53,341
- Move!
- Aw, hell.

259
00:24:53,546 --> 00:24:55,606
That's far enough, fat man.

260
00:25:00,622 --> 00:25:02,487
- Come on.
- Yes, sir.

261
00:25:02,691 --> 00:25:04,818
Come on! Come on!

262
00:25:04,926 --> 00:25:07,418
Get in there. Get in there.
You heard him.

263
00:25:07,597 --> 00:25:09,064
Cody?

264
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:14,600
Well, kiss my sister's black cat's ass!

265
00:25:14,738 --> 00:25:17,469
What the hell are you doing here?

266
00:25:17,675 --> 00:25:20,803
- I'm making a withdrawal.
- So are we, darlin'.

267
00:25:20,945 --> 00:25:23,073
How much you taking out?

268
00:25:25,217 --> 00:25:28,381
Well, give the lady her money, fat man.

269
00:25:29,923 --> 00:25:31,948
Move it!

270
00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:40,497
Thanks, Kid.

271
00:25:40,702 --> 00:25:42,363
For old times.

272
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:44,403
Boss.

273
00:25:44,606 --> 00:25:47,303
We've got it all. Let's ride.

274
00:25:47,477 --> 00:25:49,274
Come on.

275
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,758
Let's go.

276
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:08,997
Let's get out ofhere now!

277
00:26:26,122 --> 00:26:29,819
- Ah. Hold. Hold.
- Eileen, get your behind on that horse.

278
00:26:29,993 --> 00:26:32,224
What the hell you think
I'm trying to do?

279
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:47,944
You know where to find me, darlin'.

280
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,384
You son of a bitch!

281
00:26:54,723 --> 00:26:56,782
- Shit!
- Eileen, come on!

282
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,858
Stop!

283
00:27:16,314 --> 00:27:18,408
Cody!

284
00:27:18,517 --> 00:27:21,281
Come here.
Come here, you tramp.

285
00:27:24,691 --> 00:27:27,182
- Get your hands off me!
- You're up to somethin', you little tart.

286
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,522
- Damn it!
- Stand still!

287
00:27:31,165 --> 00:27:33,429
You. William Tucker.

288
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:36,969
- I'm deputizing you.
- I gotta get on back to my place.

289
00:27:37,105 --> 00:27:41,543
Well, I gotta form a posse
and get after them stinkin' Jarretts.

290
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:44,339
Now you put that down
and take her over and lock her up.

291
00:27:44,514 --> 00:27:46,745
You think you can do that, Deputy?

292
00:27:46,884 --> 00:27:49,614
- I heard you twice the first time.
- Well, then, goddamn it, do it!

293
00:27:51,957 --> 00:27:54,118
And then get yourself fixed up.

294
00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:56,489
Yeah, all right, boss.

295
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:05,195
All right.
Who's gonna volunteer for the posse?

296
00:28:05,372 --> 00:28:08,899
Come on. We gotta get 'em
before they cross the river.

297
00:28:09,077 --> 00:28:12,535
- I'll go, Marshal.
- Damn stranger's the only one of you with guts?

298
00:28:12,714 --> 00:28:15,115
It's your damn money they stole.

299
00:28:15,284 --> 00:28:17,149
You just gonna stand there
and take it?

300
00:28:20,422 --> 00:28:22,288
All right. That's better.

301
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,824
Let's mount up.

302
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:27,123
You feel like a big man?

303
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,357
I feel like my damn shoulder hurts.

304
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,299
Why don't you sit down? Act like a lady.

305
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:35,132
Tucker, watch her.
I'm going to the damn doctor.

306
00:29:04,975 --> 00:29:07,638
William.

307
00:29:07,845 --> 00:29:12,009
- Yes, ma'am.
- Come closer. Please.

308
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:25,829
- Do I look like a criminal?
- No, ma'am.

309
00:29:25,966 --> 00:29:29,197
I ain't no bank robber.

310
00:29:29,336 --> 00:29:31,202
I ain't no deputy.

311
00:29:31,406 --> 00:29:33,533
Why don't you just let me go?

312
00:29:36,379 --> 00:29:39,041
I'd like to. I really would.

313
00:29:41,385 --> 00:29:43,182
But I can't.

314
00:29:47,492 --> 00:29:49,517
I'm sorry.

315
00:30:16,626 --> 00:30:20,357
Ma'am, you shouldn't
oughta carry on like that.

316
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,458
Oh, God. For heaven's sake.

317
00:30:24,568 --> 00:30:27,436
Now, you see, when the marshal gets back,
he'll straighten everything out.

318
00:30:41,355 --> 00:30:43,346
We ain't gonna follow 'em?

319
00:30:43,457 --> 00:30:45,255
We ain't the law over there.

320
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,325
We go back.

321
00:30:58,141 --> 00:31:00,234
Are we gonna get her out?

322
00:31:01,913 --> 00:31:04,643
- Are we gonna get Eileen?
- How are we gonna do that?

323
00:31:04,849 --> 00:31:08,308
I don't know, but we got you out
when they were gonna lynch you.

324
00:31:08,487 --> 00:31:10,148
Well, now, that was lucky.

325
00:31:10,322 --> 00:31:13,815
Look, I don't let
my friends get hung.

326
00:31:13,993 --> 00:31:16,018
I want her out just as much as you.

327
00:31:16,129 --> 00:31:17,926
They're not gonna hang her.

328
00:31:18,131 --> 00:31:21,192
- So rest easy.
- Do nothin'?

329
00:31:22,469 --> 00:31:24,961
- Shit.
- I'm goin' to Kid Jarrett.

330
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:29,201
- I figure he's our best chance.
- Kid Jarrett's our best chance?

331
00:31:29,311 --> 00:31:31,803
That son of a bitch
was nothing but trouble to you.

332
00:31:31,981 --> 00:31:36,180
- That was a long time ago.
- Yeah, and this morning all he did was steal our money.

333
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,982
That's Kid's way of inviting me
to come over and see him.

334
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,417
Hell of an invitation.

335
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:46,588
Look. You don't know him. He's bored.

336
00:31:46,731 --> 00:31:50,600
He'll give us back our money and spring
Eileen from jail just for the hell of it.

337
00:31:50,803 --> 00:31:53,295
You're rating yourself
awful high, Cody.

338
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:58,337
I ran with that gang.
I know what I'm doin'.

339
00:31:58,511 --> 00:32:00,912
- Where the hell you goin'?
- With you to Kid Jarrett's.

340
00:32:01,082 --> 00:32:03,482
You don't go anywhere near Jarrett's.
Do you understand me?

341
00:32:03,651 --> 00:32:05,517
I'm goin' with ya, Cody.

342
00:32:05,721 --> 00:32:07,518
I'm warnin' you. You stay put.

343
00:32:08,991 --> 00:32:11,984
You don't do what I tell you,
you're both out.

344
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:26,440
Hey.

345
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,013
New Orleans. My daddy had a big house...

346
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,947
...in the Quarter.

347
00:32:33,153 --> 00:32:35,553
That's the French Quarter.

348
00:32:35,722 --> 00:32:37,747
Parlez français?

349
00:32:37,858 --> 00:32:39,554
Excuse me?

350
00:32:39,761 --> 00:32:42,286
It's French.

351
00:32:42,463 --> 00:32:44,454
It's the language
of love, you know.

352
00:32:44,566 --> 00:32:47,933
Oh, I didn't know the language of love
had words, ma'am.

353
00:32:48,103 --> 00:32:49,968
Oh, my, yes.

354
00:32:50,172 --> 00:32:52,232
I could teach you.

355
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:54,070
Huh?

356
00:32:54,277 --> 00:32:56,439
French. I could teach you French.

357
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,447
Oh. Of course.

358
00:33:02,454 --> 00:33:04,115
So you're a rancher.

359
00:33:04,323 --> 00:33:06,450
I got a couple dozen
head of longhorns.

360
00:33:06,591 --> 00:33:08,890
- Cattle rancher.
- Yes, ma'am.

361
00:33:09,962 --> 00:33:11,759
Nearby?

362
00:33:11,964 --> 00:33:15,298
Why, yes. Actually, about 16 miles
out on North Road.

363
00:33:15,436 --> 00:33:18,633
- It's a beautiful piece ofland.
- Huh.

364
00:33:18,772 --> 00:33:20,968
It's called the Circle Bar "T."

365
00:33:21,109 --> 00:33:23,543
Circle Bar "T."

366
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,544
- Yes, ma'am.
- That's a nice name.

367
00:33:34,891 --> 00:33:36,757
Rico!

368
00:33:41,766 --> 00:33:44,497
You can no come here, señorita.

369
00:33:53,113 --> 00:33:54,979
Cody Zamora.

370
00:33:55,182 --> 00:33:57,548
Cody Zamora.

371
00:33:57,685 --> 00:34:00,712
Bueno.

372
00:34:13,604 --> 00:34:15,469
Déme su pistola.

373
00:34:22,748 --> 00:34:26,548
¡Hola, señorita!
You here to keep the boys happy?

374
00:34:51,348 --> 00:34:53,714
It's been a long time, Cody.

375
00:34:55,186 --> 00:34:57,052
It's been a long time, Frank.

376
00:34:57,255 --> 00:34:58,882
Yeah.

377
00:35:16,344 --> 00:35:18,710
Kid said you were back in Texas.

378
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,746
Did he tell you he stole my money?

379
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,942
- He said you'd be comin',
- Damn right.

380
00:35:24,053 --> 00:35:27,080
That money is our stake for a new start
in the Oregon Territory.

381
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,021
Yours and whose, darlin'?

382
00:35:29,226 --> 00:35:32,321
Me and some friends. One of us got
a homesteader's claim.

383
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,522
Oregon.

384
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:38,069
- I ran that once.
- Now why didn't I see you at the bank?

385
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:42,937
I got what I need right here.

386
00:35:43,076 --> 00:35:45,840
Mucha tequila.

387
00:35:46,045 --> 00:35:48,104
Muchas bonitas.

388
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:50,979
Well, Kid's still hungry.

389
00:35:51,185 --> 00:35:55,680
Yeah. Thinks he can make a bigger name
for himself than his old man.

390
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:58,850
Always did want what I had...

391
00:35:58,994 --> 00:36:00,792
...didn't he?

392
00:36:00,997 --> 00:36:03,363
Well, look who's here.

393
00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:08,531
We got us some
talkin' to do, Kid.

394
00:36:08,705 --> 00:36:11,071
Let's talk.

395
00:36:14,212 --> 00:36:16,077
I'll see you around, Frank.

396
00:36:26,526 --> 00:36:29,394
Playing with the big guns now, Kid?

397
00:36:29,597 --> 00:36:33,192
- You know I always did like
playing with things. - Mm-hmm.

398
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:37,634
You're taking trains too, I see.

399
00:36:37,773 --> 00:36:43,007
Military shipment. Selling
U.S. Army guns to Juarez.

400
00:36:43,146 --> 00:36:45,707
It's funny what you can find out
when you're running pinoche...

401
00:36:45,883 --> 00:36:48,750
...to the army colonels
over at Fort Clark, right, Jack?

402
00:36:51,523 --> 00:36:54,390
By Friday, I'll be
up to my ass in Mexican gold.

403
00:36:54,593 --> 00:36:57,222
I'll bet you will.

404
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:05,503
Vete.
Vete!

405
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:17,081
- So what's on your mind?
- You invited me.

406
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:20,621
- Well, didn't you want to come?
- For the old days.

407
00:37:20,757 --> 00:37:24,454
Remember when we went riding
with that bunch down to Tucson...

408
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:26,527
...running those guns into Durango?

409
00:37:26,731 --> 00:37:30,292
- You remember that?
- We had us some times, didn't we?

410
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:42,207
You lying bitch.

411
00:37:46,186 --> 00:37:48,051
You just come here for your money.

412
00:37:48,255 --> 00:37:49,917
Oh, now, what's
the difference, Kid?

413
00:37:50,091 --> 00:37:53,185
You're gonna be up to your ass
in Mexican gold by Friday, right?

414
00:37:53,328 --> 00:37:56,992
That's right. What's 10,000
one way or the other?

415
00:37:57,166 --> 00:38:02,264
$12,432. Why don't you just give it to me,
and I'll be on my way.

416
00:38:05,342 --> 00:38:09,211
Look, I was only playing with ya.
You can have your money.

417
00:38:17,691 --> 00:38:19,556
Keep the change.

418
00:38:22,295 --> 00:38:24,696
Thanks, Kid.

419
00:38:24,865 --> 00:38:29,132
What makes you think Oregon is
gonna be any different, hmm?

420
00:38:30,605 --> 00:38:33,472
A new start for an old whore.

421
00:38:36,212 --> 00:38:40,239
Why don't you just say it, Kid?
You're still sore at me for running out.

422
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:44,753
Sore? Now, why would
I be sore? Hmm?

423
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:51,060
Because you run out on me in the middle of
the night without saying a word? Hmm?

424
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,527
I'll see you around.

425
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:09,678
She ain't coming back.

426
00:39:09,885 --> 00:39:13,753
- She is so.
- I'm going to get Eileen. Are you with me or not?

427
00:39:15,425 --> 00:39:18,292
- When Cody comes back and we're not here...
- Don't worry about it.

428
00:39:18,495 --> 00:39:21,363
She'll wait.

429
00:39:21,565 --> 00:39:22,623
Lilly.

430
00:40:04,248 --> 00:40:06,809
Don't hurt me.

431
00:40:06,985 --> 00:40:09,545
There's no chance of that.

432
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,427
Electric chair? If you ask me...

433
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,971
...it'd be a hell of a lot cheaper
just to hang 'em.

434
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:29,840
- That way, you can use
the rope over and over again.

435
00:40:30,046 --> 00:40:32,913
- What's that?
- Huh?

436
00:40:33,115 --> 00:40:35,209
There. That's that whore.

437
00:40:37,454 --> 00:40:40,150
That ain't her. You're drunk.

438
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:42,451
- She's been beaten.
- Here.

439
00:40:42,594 --> 00:40:44,459
- Can you help her?
- Here.

440
00:40:46,164 --> 00:40:50,033
Her back.

441
00:40:50,236 --> 00:40:52,637
Her back was beaten.

442
00:41:00,348 --> 00:41:04,581
Aw, hell. Why we gotta walk all the way
the hell down here for?

443
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,848
Because she's in one of
these tents. I seen her.

444
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,858
You ain't seen her.
I say we go right across the street...

445
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,324
...and get our bell ropes pulled.

446
00:41:13,463 --> 00:41:15,864
I thought we were off duty.

447
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:18,593
We ain't ever off duty.

448
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:22,103
Psst. Hey, fellas.

449
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,708
You those fellas
after that whore from Echo City?

450
00:41:24,876 --> 00:41:27,675
What's it to ya?

451
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,041
You seen her?

452
00:41:30,182 --> 00:41:35,644
Well, now, it depends.
That poster talked about a reward?

453
00:41:37,457 --> 00:41:39,688
Well, could be there's
a real big reward.

454
00:41:39,827 --> 00:41:42,887
- Could be I know where that whore is right now.
- Where'd that be?

455
00:41:44,266 --> 00:41:45,130
Where'd that reward be?

456
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:50,096
$500 wired to you when we get her.

457
00:41:51,574 --> 00:41:54,270
My word as a Peckerton Ditinctive.

458
00:42:02,688 --> 00:42:05,122
$500 is more than I'm used to.

459
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,558
All right. I seen that whore Cody riding
up river not an hour ago.

460
00:42:11,698 --> 00:42:15,294
- Well, hell, why didn't you do something?
- She's with Kid Jarrett.

461
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:17,960
Are you sure it were Kid Jarrett?

462
00:42:18,138 --> 00:42:21,939
Sure enough. I'd of done something too,
but I ain't no Peckerton Ditinctive.

463
00:42:22,143 --> 00:42:26,581
Hell, Cody Zamora and Kid Jarrett.

464
00:42:44,136 --> 00:42:46,400
Powerful...

465
00:42:46,538 --> 00:42:50,669
...gunpowder heal wound.

466
00:43:02,657 --> 00:43:04,922
Okay. Okay.

467
00:43:14,505 --> 00:43:18,306
You'll be all right.
You'll be all right.

468
00:43:23,582 --> 00:43:26,312
- Tucker.
- Yeah, what do you want, Earl?

469
00:43:26,485 --> 00:43:28,351
Get out here, Tucker.

470
00:43:36,164 --> 00:43:39,623
- What are you doing?
- Interrogating the prisoner.

471
00:43:39,802 --> 00:43:43,238
Well, you ain't trained for that.
I'll take over.

472
00:43:43,372 --> 00:43:45,534
I'm making some
real good headway there, Earl.

473
00:43:45,675 --> 00:43:47,802
Your ranch is waiting on you, boy.

474
00:43:47,911 --> 00:43:51,177
I expect that can wait
a good while longer.

475
00:43:51,315 --> 00:43:54,512
Now, I been talking to her.
She ain't no bank robber.

476
00:43:57,255 --> 00:44:00,713
In fact, she's a real fine lady
from New Orleans.

477
00:44:00,892 --> 00:44:04,385
Tucker, you go home now.

478
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:08,828
Um, I'm turning myself in.

479
00:44:09,002 --> 00:44:13,269
- Say what?
- I was with the gang that robbed the bank.

480
00:44:13,408 --> 00:44:15,740
Oh, I can't take it anymore.

481
00:44:15,877 --> 00:44:18,437
Maybe you oughta sit down.

482
00:44:20,216 --> 00:44:22,047
Eileen.

483
00:44:24,888 --> 00:44:27,755
- It's about damn time.
- Here. Tie this on.

484
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:39,933
Y'all don't know how hard
it is being hunted.

485
00:44:40,072 --> 00:44:43,804
Men wanting you everywhere you go.

486
00:44:43,977 --> 00:44:46,002
I just wanna be safe.

487
00:44:48,015 --> 00:44:51,451
What are you doing standin' here?
Go and question the prisoner, son.

488
00:44:59,795 --> 00:45:01,160
- William.
- Yes.

489
00:45:01,297 --> 00:45:04,357
- How would you like to kiss me?
- Excuse me?

490
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:08,131
First, they hurt me right there.

491
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,866
- Mmm.
- And then...

492
00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:17,545
- They hurt me right there.
- Mm-mm-mm-mm.

493
00:45:19,218 --> 00:45:23,246
Ma'am, those may be severe injuries,
but I don't see any marks.

494
00:45:23,356 --> 00:45:26,723
Perhaps if you just
move it up a little bit.

495
00:45:47,284 --> 00:45:50,412
- Oh!
- Shit.

496
00:45:50,554 --> 00:45:52,716
Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.

497
00:45:54,426 --> 00:45:57,191
- I've got more injuries.
- Show me later.

498
00:45:58,864 --> 00:46:02,163
Gettin' me out in the middle of something...

499
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:10,067
Here's your chance to be a big hero
to someone in real trouble.

500
00:46:10,178 --> 00:46:13,306
I swear, on my honor
as a Southern lady.

501
00:46:13,414 --> 00:46:15,144
Get out of my way.

502
00:46:15,351 --> 00:46:17,785
Hang on.

503
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,584
I didn't have anything to do with that
robbery. You're just gonna have to believe me.

504
00:46:21,758 --> 00:46:24,886
- Move!
- Please, William.

505
00:46:24,995 --> 00:46:27,430
- I don't know why
I believe you, but I do.

506
00:46:27,565 --> 00:46:30,432
- You're doing the right thing.
- Yeah, sure.

507
00:46:30,635 --> 00:46:34,367
- Come on. Get out.
- And you know what? For your own good.

508
00:46:34,539 --> 00:46:37,668
- Wait! Wait! Hang on now!
- You're just gonna have to wait in there.

509
00:46:37,777 --> 00:46:40,268
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you, William.

510
00:46:40,446 --> 00:46:42,779
You tell 'em that we held
a gun to your head.

511
00:46:42,916 --> 00:46:45,578
- Eileen, come on.
- Let's go. You take care, William.

512
00:46:51,126 --> 00:46:52,991
Let's get the hell out of here.

513
00:46:53,194 --> 00:46:55,925
Come on. They was tryin'
to make me eat beans.

514
00:47:09,814 --> 00:47:11,680
Hold up. Hold up.

515
00:47:14,219 --> 00:47:16,653
- It's Cody's horse.
- See if you can find her.

516
00:47:16,789 --> 00:47:19,350
- We'll be at the Circle Bar "T." Sixteen miles...
- Okay.

517
00:47:19,526 --> 00:47:21,391
- Up the road next to Turtle Creek.
- Got it.

518
00:47:21,594 --> 00:47:23,392
Let's go.

519
00:47:30,772 --> 00:47:34,504
Don't worry, mister. Wife be okay.

520
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:38,780
Thank you.

521
00:47:45,422 --> 00:47:48,688
Well, Mr. McCoy.

522
00:47:50,261 --> 00:47:54,392
You seem to be my lucky penny.

523
00:47:54,533 --> 00:48:00,268
It weren't no accident I was in Echo City
or that I tracked you here.

524
00:48:02,409 --> 00:48:04,674
Word was you had a history
with the Jarretts.

525
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:19,862
I told you I was a prospector.
That's all true.

526
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:22,727
I'm on my way to the Klondike.
I got a claim there.

527
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,334
It could be worth a fortune in gold...

528
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:28,871
...but first I've got an old score
to settle with Frank Jarrett.

529
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:32,273
He jumped my father's claim,
then he killed him...

530
00:48:32,412 --> 00:48:35,176
...and my ma was done
like-like you was.

531
00:48:39,253 --> 00:48:41,983
She lived on a couple years.

532
00:48:46,261 --> 00:48:49,322
I swore on her grave
I'd live to see Frank Jarrett die.

533
00:48:52,701 --> 00:48:56,763
So you figured that Jarrett's whore
might lead you back to him.

534
00:48:56,873 --> 00:48:58,670
Yes, ma'am.

535
00:49:01,245 --> 00:49:03,736
That was the truth of it.

536
00:49:11,624 --> 00:49:14,491
I didn't get our money.

537
00:49:43,995 --> 00:49:46,556
Circle Bar "T," all right.

538
00:49:46,732 --> 00:49:51,294
- This is big.
- Ha! This ain't so big.

539
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:55,202
This used to all be free-range.

540
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:59,107
Law of the land was the cattle could go
where they pleased.

541
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,077
You see that barbed wire?

542
00:50:01,282 --> 00:50:03,547
That gave small ranchers like Tucker
a chance to get started...

543
00:50:03,685 --> 00:50:06,848
...without being overrun by
the cattle from the big outfits.

544
00:50:06,989 --> 00:50:11,120
You know, folks say the West
was conquered by the railroad.

545
00:50:11,227 --> 00:50:16,359
Uh-uh. My daddy says
it was conquered by barbed wire.

546
00:50:16,467 --> 00:50:22,031
Well, you sure know a lot about this for
a fine Southern lady from New Orleans.

547
00:50:22,207 --> 00:50:25,643
Ah, Lilly,
I ain't from New Orleans.

548
00:50:25,777 --> 00:50:28,212
I'd like to have been.

549
00:50:28,347 --> 00:50:33,217
I grew up on an east Texas grub ranch
not much different from this one.

550
00:50:34,855 --> 00:50:37,289
Well, I don't know much
about grub ranches...

551
00:50:37,424 --> 00:50:40,986
...but this sure looks nice to me, Eileen.

552
00:50:41,162 --> 00:50:43,723
It's got possibilities.

553
00:50:51,374 --> 00:50:56,506
Well, ain't this sweet?

554
00:50:56,647 --> 00:51:00,208
Little boy's gonna rob
an army choo-choo.

555
00:51:00,384 --> 00:51:04,822
Gonna get hisself
a big, new toy gun, huh?

556
00:51:04,957 --> 00:51:09,258
That gun's gonna make me rich, old man.

557
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:47,031
Oh, hi, William.
I hope you don't mind.

558
00:51:47,207 --> 00:51:50,267
I kind of helped myself
to a few things.

559
00:51:53,414 --> 00:51:57,441
I- I-I've made a really nice stew.

560
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,765
I wouldn't go in there if I was you.

561
00:52:16,608 --> 00:52:20,704
Our friend's restin' in your bed.

562
00:52:20,812 --> 00:52:24,180
Sure is nice of you
to let us stay here, Mr. Tucker.

563
00:52:24,316 --> 00:52:27,184
Most kind.
Now, wouldn't you like some stew?

564
00:52:27,387 --> 00:52:30,254
- I've made some pies.
- Sure smells good.

565
00:52:30,457 --> 00:52:33,188
Hi. Joshua McCoy.

566
00:52:33,361 --> 00:52:35,921
You got a real nice
spread here, William.

567
00:52:36,097 --> 00:52:38,658
That's just great.

568
00:52:40,569 --> 00:52:43,003
That's just great.

569
00:52:43,138 --> 00:52:47,007
Why don't y'all just
make yourselves at home?

570
00:53:09,303 --> 00:53:13,764
I been alone out here goin'
on a couple of years...

571
00:53:13,942 --> 00:53:16,035
...since my family died.

572
00:53:16,144 --> 00:53:19,979
I reckon you're the first company
I've had out here.

573
00:53:20,182 --> 00:53:24,449
I guess I wouldn't
be much of a man...

574
00:53:24,588 --> 00:53:27,716
...if I wasn't at least hospitable.

575
00:53:33,097 --> 00:53:35,224
Welcome to my home.

576
00:54:07,437 --> 00:54:12,307
The population of the United States
is over 63 million people now.

577
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,647
Well, they sure ain't here.

578
00:54:17,783 --> 00:54:20,115
I better let you get some rest.

579
00:54:20,252 --> 00:54:21,880
No, you can stay.

580
00:54:24,591 --> 00:54:28,323
Well, I suppose
I don't wanna be alone.

581
00:54:29,831 --> 00:54:34,963
That's funny?

582
00:54:36,004 --> 00:54:38,438
Funnier than you know.

583
00:54:45,416 --> 00:54:47,281
I suppose I'd like to stay.

584
00:55:20,123 --> 00:55:22,990
May I have the pleasure of a dance?

585
00:55:24,628 --> 00:55:26,494
Oh, I don't know.

586
00:55:26,697 --> 00:55:29,564
Come on. You're not gonna
turn me down, are you?

587
00:55:29,767 --> 00:55:34,034
Well, I don't... I don't
do a lot of dancin' out here.

588
00:55:34,139 --> 00:55:37,405
I feel kind of silly.

589
00:56:28,403 --> 00:56:31,531
You boys are making me very angry.

590
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:35,077
Now, let's not be shy,
and do what I told you.

591
00:56:36,779 --> 00:56:39,374
That's it.

592
00:56:39,516 --> 00:56:41,347
You boys are gonna be famous.

593
00:56:41,518 --> 00:56:44,248
Tell your grandchildren you got
held up by Kid Jarrett.

594
00:56:55,201 --> 00:56:58,103
- Here, I'll get it.
- Don't look so sad, boys.

595
00:56:58,271 --> 00:57:00,865
You look good in your drawers.

596
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:05,971
You fools be careful with that thing!

597
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,982
That's precious cargo we've got there.

598
00:57:12,454 --> 00:57:15,049
Shit! It's okay, boss.

599
00:57:42,924 --> 00:57:44,653
Hyah! Giddap!

600
00:57:57,841 --> 00:57:59,867
Now.

601
00:58:06,285 --> 00:58:07,877
Up in the hills!

602
00:58:30,446 --> 00:58:33,745
What are you doin', Jack?
Get this wagon out of here.

603
00:58:33,883 --> 00:58:37,342
Okay, Boss.
Come on! Giddap!

604
00:58:47,133 --> 00:58:50,830
- Where are you goin', Jack?
- Aah!

605
00:58:51,003 --> 00:58:55,202
Roberto! Come back here and fight!

606
00:58:55,308 --> 00:58:57,539
Yuma! Roberto!

607
00:58:57,645 --> 00:59:00,705
You yellow dogs! Get back here!

608
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,612
Oh, damn!

609
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:32,284
Ned! Ned!
Ned, where you goin'?

610
00:59:37,124 --> 00:59:39,252
Anita!

611
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,464
Get your yellow asses
back here, you cowards!

612
00:59:48,237 --> 00:59:50,263
Oh, God.

613
00:59:50,373 --> 00:59:53,206
- Can you get up?
- Yeah.

614
01:00:25,615 --> 01:00:29,712
You dumb ass! Ain't nothin' but Cody
and a bunch of women!

615
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:31,617
Ha! Better go find your toy, sonny.

616
01:00:57,018 --> 01:00:59,613
Where do you think you're goin'?

617
01:00:59,788 --> 01:01:02,518
Put me down, you asshole!

618
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:10,065
Name of the man
that's killin' ya is Joshua McCoy.

619
01:01:10,234 --> 01:01:12,998
Don't mean spit to me, boy.

620
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:16,072
Josh, they got Lilly. Kid's got Lilly.

621
01:01:16,241 --> 01:01:21,236
- Cody.
- Bring him along. We'll trade him for Lilly.

622
01:01:36,764 --> 01:01:39,063
I'm sorry, boss.
What happened to Jack?

623
01:01:39,168 --> 01:01:42,296
You won't be seeing him no more.
What about you, Ned?

624
01:01:42,404 --> 01:01:47,001
Tried my best, boss. Almost got
my ass shot off. Lost my damn hat too.

625
01:01:47,143 --> 01:01:49,977
- Where's Frank?
- They got him and they got the guns...

626
01:01:50,147 --> 01:01:52,877
...but we got this so we're
gonna make a little trade.

627
01:01:56,822 --> 01:02:00,155
I seen one of these once
at the armory in Cheyenne.

628
01:02:00,292 --> 01:02:03,421
God, it's heavy.

629
01:02:03,529 --> 01:02:06,191
We trade Frank for Lilly.
When we get her...

630
01:02:06,367 --> 01:02:09,461
...we give Kid this toy
and get our money back.

631
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:13,473
- This is not a toy.
- Let's get to work.

632
01:02:13,641 --> 01:02:16,405
I can't believe we're even thinking
about doing this.

633
01:02:16,578 --> 01:02:19,946
I can't stand to think of her there with
those dirty, disgusting men.

634
01:02:20,082 --> 01:02:23,108
Only reason she's there is we went
running off after Kid in the first place.

635
01:02:23,219 --> 01:02:25,450
Are you saying this is my fault?

636
01:02:25,555 --> 01:02:28,251
All you care about is revenge on Kid.

637
01:02:28,425 --> 01:02:31,020
You went with us, Anita.
You came along.

638
01:02:31,162 --> 01:02:33,756
I never should've gone.
None of us ever should've gone.

639
01:02:33,898 --> 01:02:37,027
None of this ever should've happened.
I shouldn't of let anything happen.

640
01:02:37,136 --> 01:02:40,697
- We have no choice. We have to get Lilly.
- I know!

641
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,468
- Nita.
- Let her go.

642
01:02:43,643 --> 01:02:45,543
Nita!

643
01:02:55,123 --> 01:02:59,026
Nita! Nita!

644
01:03:02,131 --> 01:03:06,694
Can I have some of that water, please?
Mighty thirsty.

645
01:03:19,251 --> 01:03:21,049
Thank you.

646
01:03:25,826 --> 01:03:28,660
Couldn't help but overhearing
about that land.

647
01:03:31,132 --> 01:03:33,499
In Oregon, ain't it?

648
01:03:36,672 --> 01:03:40,769
Grand territory, Oregon.
Spent a couple of years there once.

649
01:03:40,877 --> 01:03:43,141
Lot of rain. Lot oflaws.

650
01:03:43,246 --> 01:03:45,374
Don't like either.

651
01:03:45,483 --> 01:03:48,043
Why are you talking to me?

652
01:03:48,185 --> 01:03:50,780
Cody told me about your plans.

653
01:03:52,157 --> 01:03:53,749
Sounds sweet.

654
01:03:55,862 --> 01:04:01,358
It's just that I've never heard of no
single miss holding a claim for land...

655
01:04:01,502 --> 01:04:04,096
...in Oregon, that is.

656
01:04:06,673 --> 01:04:10,041
Well, just because you haven't heard of it
doesn't mean it can't happen.

657
01:04:10,178 --> 01:04:12,544
Suppose not.

658
01:04:27,732 --> 01:04:31,863
- Where is she off to?
- She's just riding off some steam.

659
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:34,404
She sure picked a good time
to pitch a fit.

660
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:37,101
If it were her in trouble, Lilly'd be
the first one to be there.

661
01:04:38,912 --> 01:04:41,746
What's your name?

662
01:04:41,916 --> 01:04:46,046
- Lilly.
- Just Lilly?

663
01:04:46,153 --> 01:04:50,648
- Lilly's enough.
- Yeah, if you answer to it.

664
01:04:50,792 --> 01:04:53,227
That depends on who's askin'.

665
01:04:55,498 --> 01:05:00,334
You don't look much like a parlor house
girl in those pants and boots.

666
01:05:02,573 --> 01:05:04,565
What's your family name?

667
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:13,517
- Laronette.
- Laronette?

668
01:05:13,686 --> 01:05:18,351
I knowed a Roy Laronette. Seen him in
a Wild West show over in Del Rio.

669
01:05:18,525 --> 01:05:21,552
- Best trick rider I ever seed.
- Is that a fact?

670
01:05:21,662 --> 01:05:26,964
Well, how'd the daughter of a trick
rider wind up working in a parlor house?

671
01:05:27,068 --> 01:05:31,665
He died... And the show
died with him.

672
01:05:33,242 --> 01:05:35,574
It came up to me to pay off his debts.

673
01:05:35,712 --> 01:05:40,912
Oh. Well, ain't you
daddy's sweet little girl?

674
01:05:46,791 --> 01:05:50,228
- Sit her down.
- Sit down!

675
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:52,797
We got a real hellcat here.

676
01:05:52,932 --> 01:05:55,230
May take some time breakin'her in...

677
01:05:57,571 --> 01:06:00,597
...but it's gonna be a lot of fun doin' it.

678
01:06:16,426 --> 01:06:19,726
This claim of yours
seems proper enough, young lady.

679
01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:21,730
Why worry your little head?

680
01:06:21,899 --> 01:06:24,094
Your husband seems to have
these matters well in hand.

681
01:06:25,537 --> 01:06:28,597
What if my husband is deceased?

682
01:06:45,026 --> 01:06:47,723
Ma'am, I don't quite know
how to tell you this, but...

683
01:06:47,897 --> 01:06:49,762
Tell me what?

684
01:06:49,932 --> 01:06:52,366
Well, your claim's worthless
without your husband alive.

685
01:06:55,639 --> 01:06:58,938
See for yourself. Uh, second paragraph.

686
01:07:04,983 --> 01:07:07,281
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but it's the law.

687
01:07:07,386 --> 01:07:11,289
- Surely you understand that.
- Yes, I understand that.

688
01:07:13,126 --> 01:07:18,724
I was worthless until I married,
so now I guess I'm worthless as a widow.

689
01:07:18,866 --> 01:07:20,993
Funny. I had some value as a whore.

690
01:07:23,238 --> 01:07:25,968
- Did I shock you?
- Well, no, ma'am, I...

691
01:07:26,141 --> 01:07:31,136
You expect me to cry all over your big desk?
Well, to hell with that.

692
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:34,843
If your laws don't include me, well,
then, they just don't apply to me either.

693
01:07:34,985 --> 01:07:38,887
Ma'am, that'll still be
six bits for my services.

694
01:07:48,467 --> 01:07:52,097
Keep the change, you sawed-off fart.

695
01:08:05,521 --> 01:08:07,751
Don't let him play with you.

696
01:08:07,856 --> 01:08:10,451
Well, looky here.

697
01:08:10,593 --> 01:08:14,257
My little whore finally
found herself a pretty boy.

698
01:08:14,431 --> 01:08:17,025
Keep talkin'. That's all you can do.

699
01:08:17,168 --> 01:08:19,899
There was a time I did a hell of
a lot more than talk to you.

700
01:08:20,071 --> 01:08:23,370
You know where I found her?

701
01:08:23,475 --> 01:08:26,741
She was scrubbin' floors
in a parlor house.

702
01:08:26,846 --> 01:08:29,713
Wasn't more than 14.

703
01:08:34,855 --> 01:08:37,654
She weren't contrary
like that back then.

704
01:08:37,826 --> 01:08:39,657
No, sirree.

705
01:08:39,828 --> 01:08:43,424
Got her real excited
being with a bunch of bandits.

706
01:08:43,566 --> 01:08:47,866
My God, how she'd open up to me.

707
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:51,099
How she carried on.

708
01:08:51,208 --> 01:08:55,509
Then you. Look at you.
A lovesick pretty boy.

709
01:08:55,613 --> 01:09:00,210
Now after all these years
of wantin'to kill me...

710
01:09:00,352 --> 01:09:03,788
She won't let ya.

711
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:09,525
Nothing's changed.

712
01:09:09,629 --> 01:09:13,430
You're dead. I just ain't killed ya yet.

713
01:10:07,463 --> 01:10:11,195
Hey, pretty boy! Come over here.

714
01:10:11,368 --> 01:10:13,393
Come on over here.
I got somethin' to tell ya.

715
01:10:27,487 --> 01:10:31,150
Yeah, you look just like your ma.

716
01:10:31,325 --> 01:10:33,760
Real pretty.

717
01:10:36,331 --> 01:10:38,926
Beautiful piece
of a woman, your ma.

718
01:10:41,203 --> 01:10:44,833
Evangaline. Am I right?

719
01:10:51,182 --> 01:10:53,309
Josh!

720
01:10:58,056 --> 01:11:01,356
What happened?

721
01:11:03,796 --> 01:11:06,391
He tried to escape. I shot him.

722
01:11:19,315 --> 01:11:22,751
Did you shoot him before or after
you untied him?

723
01:11:27,691 --> 01:11:29,592
I said...

724
01:11:29,761 --> 01:11:34,061
...did you shoot him before
or after you untied him?

725
01:11:36,602 --> 01:11:38,399
He brought it on himself.

726
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:41,472
He was playing you,
and you couldn't rein yourself in...

727
01:11:41,641 --> 01:11:45,236
...and now we can't
trade him for Lilly.

728
01:11:45,412 --> 01:11:47,711
Get the hell out of my sight.

729
01:11:47,815 --> 01:11:50,113
Keep ridin' till you hit the Klondike.

730
01:12:47,384 --> 01:12:49,182
Nita!

731
01:12:53,959 --> 01:12:55,791
Sweet pea, where have you been?

732
01:12:55,995 --> 01:13:00,398
- The claim's no good.
- What?

733
01:13:00,566 --> 01:13:05,197
I went to a lawyer's office in town. He said
the claim's no good without Jim alive.

734
01:13:19,422 --> 01:13:23,188
- Let's go get Lilly.
- Come on.

735
01:13:23,393 --> 01:13:25,191
What are you lookin' at?

736
01:13:25,396 --> 01:13:28,058
Pigs.

737
01:13:28,266 --> 01:13:30,462
You know, you're gonna be
around here a while, girl.

738
01:13:30,602 --> 01:13:33,036
You better be a little more friendly-like
and get to know everybody.

739
01:13:33,205 --> 01:13:34,866
Over here is Rico.

740
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:39,007
This here is Ned.

741
01:13:40,146 --> 01:13:42,012
Roberto.

742
01:13:44,585 --> 01:13:48,147
This here's Yuma.
Me and Yuma go back a long ways.

743
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:51,918
- Isn't that right, partner?
- Long ways, Kid.

744
01:13:52,093 --> 01:13:56,428
Go inside and get one of Cody's
old dresses out of my trunk.

745
01:13:56,566 --> 01:13:57,828
Right away.

746
01:14:07,545 --> 01:14:09,639
Have a drink.

747
01:14:11,951 --> 01:14:13,316
Drink!

748
01:14:29,571 --> 01:14:34,066
The more I think about it, it might
be nice having you around here.

749
01:14:34,244 --> 01:14:37,111
Let those whores keep the old buzzard.

750
01:14:37,313 --> 01:14:39,976
- Hey, boss.
- Not that one. The red one.

751
01:14:50,796 --> 01:14:52,593
Get up.

752
01:14:54,333 --> 01:14:56,131
Get up!

753
01:15:03,177 --> 01:15:04,906
Take your clothes off.

754
01:15:35,315 --> 01:15:37,784
Get in here.

755
01:15:55,906 --> 01:15:58,967
- Damn it, boss!
- You keep your ass in there!

756
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:00,907
Least let us watch.

757
01:16:05,184 --> 01:16:06,981
Put it on.

758
01:17:12,395 --> 01:17:17,493
Ned. She's all yours.

759
01:17:35,155 --> 01:17:37,420
Hello, girlie.

760
01:17:40,195 --> 01:17:44,656
What do you say old Ned unties you,
and we can have some fun, huh?

761
01:17:44,834 --> 01:17:47,530
You better kill me first...

762
01:17:47,737 --> 01:17:51,332
'cause the only way
I'd lay with you is if I was dead.

763
01:18:26,449 --> 01:18:29,112
It's Josh.

764
01:18:29,286 --> 01:18:32,847
- Look again.
- Lilly? Oh, Lilly.

765
01:18:33,023 --> 01:18:36,152
- Lilly, I've been so worried about you.
- You should've seen it.

766
01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:39,787
It was crazy. Bombs going off everywhere.
Josh came in, attacked Kid's place.

767
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:43,833
Got me out of there. I was riding out.

768
01:18:44,036 --> 01:18:47,097
- I looked behind me, but he wasn't there.
- Where is he?

769
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:49,765
I think they got him.

770
01:20:59,962 --> 01:21:02,226
Where's the old man?

771
01:21:02,365 --> 01:21:04,027
Dead.

772
01:21:04,201 --> 01:21:07,898
Well, that is a shame.

773
01:21:08,105 --> 01:21:09,869
What are you gonna do now?

774
01:21:10,075 --> 01:21:13,340
- Where's McCoy?
- Oh, him.

775
01:21:15,414 --> 01:21:19,680
He's here, but I wouldn't
worry about him.

776
01:21:19,819 --> 01:21:23,881
He ain't dead... Yet.

777
01:21:26,394 --> 01:21:30,490
- I'll buy him.
- You ain't got enough money to buy him from me, darlin'.

778
01:21:30,631 --> 01:21:33,192
Well, now, you don't have
a Gatling gun, do ya?

779
01:21:33,368 --> 01:21:36,201
That is true. That is true.

780
01:21:41,811 --> 01:21:45,441
- Just show me the gun.
- Show me McCoy.

781
01:21:46,617 --> 01:21:48,482
Tráelo!

782
01:21:55,528 --> 01:22:00,193
I've shown you mine.
You show me yours.

783
01:22:07,842 --> 01:22:12,576
Can I offer you ladies a drink?

784
01:22:18,989 --> 01:22:20,479
Go get it.

785
01:22:24,695 --> 01:22:26,822
Kid!

786
01:22:39,312 --> 01:22:42,146
- Now, hurry up.
- Yeah, boss!

787
01:22:46,188 --> 01:22:47,985
Come on.

788
01:23:04,742 --> 01:23:07,176
Open that up! Let's see
what we got there.

789
01:23:11,550 --> 01:23:14,383
Hey, Lilly, welcome back.

790
01:23:21,195 --> 01:23:22,924
Yes. Yes.

791
01:23:27,903 --> 01:23:30,963
You want him?

792
01:23:33,743 --> 01:23:35,506
Take him.

793
01:23:46,758 --> 01:23:48,521
Josh.

794
01:24:11,987 --> 01:24:14,456
Josh.

795
01:24:22,833 --> 01:24:27,464
Oh, that's real sweet...
comin'from a heartless whore.

796
01:24:35,349 --> 01:24:37,112
That's what you came for.

797
01:24:37,318 --> 01:24:40,685
Now get your ass outta here.

798
01:24:49,665 --> 01:24:51,929
Cody. Let's go.

799
01:25:14,027 --> 01:25:16,223
Girlie.

800
01:25:16,364 --> 01:25:19,390
You come back
and see old Ned, you hear?

801
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:22,868
We'll finish what we got started.

802
01:25:25,774 --> 01:25:29,506
Lilly.

803
01:26:01,150 --> 01:26:02,742
Cover me!

804
01:26:22,641 --> 01:26:24,872
Lilly!

805
01:26:50,173 --> 01:26:52,768
Cody! Here! Be careful! Here!

806
01:28:10,768 --> 01:28:13,567
Just foolin'.

807
01:28:15,106 --> 01:28:18,838
You don't think I'd shoot you
in the back, do you, darlin'?

808
01:28:19,011 --> 01:28:22,879
I'm even out of bullets. I got no bullets.

809
01:28:41,136 --> 01:28:45,506
Pick it up. Put it in. Die like a man.

810
01:29:08,269 --> 01:29:10,568
You are a dumb whore.

811
01:31:32,237 --> 01:31:34,069
Looks like you could use some help.

812
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:36,538
Yeah, I reckon I could.

813
01:31:44,251 --> 01:31:46,015
You all set to go?

814
01:31:47,522 --> 01:31:49,319
I guess.

815
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:02,672
I'd sure be mite pleased
if you decided to stay on...

816
01:32:05,577 --> 01:32:07,477
...share this place.

817
01:32:13,586 --> 01:32:17,318
Oh. Well...

818
01:32:17,491 --> 01:32:19,926
William...

819
01:32:20,061 --> 01:32:22,188
I think there's something
I need to tell you.

820
01:32:22,296 --> 01:32:25,733
I know all about that.

821
01:32:25,868 --> 01:32:28,462
It's all in the past.
It don't matter to me none...

822
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:30,729
- So you don't have...
- I'm no lady from New Orleans.

823
01:32:30,839 --> 01:32:35,573
My daddy was a poor rancher.
Nearly worked himself to death...

824
01:32:35,778 --> 01:32:38,270
...till the bank came and took it all away.

825
01:32:38,415 --> 01:32:40,713
I told myself...

826
01:32:42,453 --> 01:32:44,888
I'd get away from
that damn dirt pile...

827
01:32:45,023 --> 01:32:48,424
...and marry me a rich gentleman.

828
01:32:51,998 --> 01:32:54,433
I was so stupid.

829
01:32:54,601 --> 01:32:59,004
All I ever got was a...
couple of fancy dresses...

830
01:33:00,542 --> 01:33:02,669
...and a broken heart.

831
01:33:05,179 --> 01:33:09,947
I got this land. I ain't got no money.

832
01:33:12,055 --> 01:33:14,182
But I swear...

833
01:33:15,225 --> 01:33:17,056
I'll never break your heart.

834
01:33:33,279 --> 01:33:35,111
- Oh! Geez! That's my arm.
- Sorry.

835
01:33:37,451 --> 01:33:40,045
It's your share. You earned it.

836
01:33:40,188 --> 01:33:42,486
Consider it a wedding present.

837
01:33:42,591 --> 01:33:45,321
I got everything I need right here...

838
01:33:45,493 --> 01:33:47,792
...but I'll take it.

839
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:52,768
Well, the rest of it's here...

840
01:33:52,903 --> 01:33:56,634
...all except the $12,432,
which belongs to us.

841
01:33:59,010 --> 01:34:02,605
You should stay. When that money
gets back to Agua Dulce...

842
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:05,477
I expect y'all are gonna be
big heroes in these parts.

843
01:34:05,684 --> 01:34:09,280
We ain't heroes.

844
01:34:10,957 --> 01:34:13,619
Well, it's time to go.

845
01:34:13,793 --> 01:34:16,524
There's a gold mine in the Klondike
waitin' on some hard work.

846
01:34:16,697 --> 01:34:18,597
That's a long way.

847
01:34:20,902 --> 01:34:23,302
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye, sweet pea.

848
01:34:27,276 --> 01:34:29,972
See you. Take good care of her.

849
01:34:30,146 --> 01:34:33,241
She's two handfuls,
but I'm gonna hang on.

850
01:34:39,491 --> 01:34:41,083
Eileen.

851
01:34:45,665 --> 01:34:49,966
- Hey, you'll see her again.
- It ain't likely.

852
01:34:51,838 --> 01:34:54,102
Love you.

853
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:00,477
Let's ride.

854
01:35:10,694 --> 01:35:14,961
Oh, Lilly, I love you all the way
to the moon and back.

855
01:35:15,066 --> 01:35:17,660
That's not gonna change.

856
01:35:52,677 --> 01:35:55,111
She killed a fella
up in Colorado Territory.

857
01:35:55,246 --> 01:35:58,842
Sorry, son. The only female I seen in
the last month is that mare over there...

858
01:35:59,017 --> 01:36:01,884
...and she's starting
to look pretty good to me, ain't she?

859
01:36:02,054 --> 01:36:03,784
Yeah.

860
01:36:03,957 --> 01:36:06,391
Hey, what's that
you're drinkin' there?

861
01:36:06,526 --> 01:36:09,428
- Tennessee sippin' whiskey.
- Come on.
