SHOOT A MAN HE SUSPECTED
IN THE MURDERS?

94
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,167

 <i>WOULD HE</i>
 <i>CIRCULATE MY OPTIMISM?</i>

TURN OF MIND.

FROM THE LOOK OF HIM,

113
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:54,000
THINK THAT DOC'S BEEN WRONG
ONCE OR TWICE IN HIS LIFE?

MAYBE ONCE
OR TWICE.

THAT'S YOUR END,
RIGHT THERE.

305
00:19:08,934 --> 00:19:10,868
WEIGHED TO THE OUNCE.

306
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:15,434
MY PROBLEM WAS WE DIDN'T
CLEAR THIS WITH YOU.

307
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:18,834
 <i>AND YOU KNOW</i>
 <i>HOW YOU GET, AL.</i>

THAT YOURSELF.

309
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:24,734
BUT MY PROBLEM
WAS BRINGING UP
THE SUBJECT.

310
00:19:24,734 --> 00:19:26,501
BUT, UH...

311

YOU KNOW WHY I GET
HOW I GET?

313
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:36,200
YOU WANNA SEE OVER THE JOB,
YOU DON'T LIKE LOOSE ENDS.

314
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,901

315
00:19:37,901 --> 00:19:39,901
THINGS DONE HALF-ASS,

316
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:41,701
BAGS OF SHIT
LEFT TO HOLD.

317
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:44,167
THERE'S NO LOOSE ENDS,
I'LL GUARANTEE YOU.

318
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:46,534
'CAUSE I GOT A WHOLE

323
00:19:57,701 --> 00:20:00,000
I'M SAYING THAT'S
PRETTY HARD TO BELIEVE.

324
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,367
I BELIEVE YOU,

00:20:05,734 --> 00:20:08,968
IS IT TALKING?
CAN IT SPEAK ENGLISH?

327
00:20:08,968 --> 00:20:12,167
WHEN WE WAS SEEING TO 'EM,

00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:22,334
IF YOU KNEW
THE FUCKING PROBLEM.

331
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:25,467
WHEN IT COMES
THE SQUAREHEAD'S TIME,

337
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,501

00:35:59,133 --> 00:36:02,334
NO LAW
OR ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT.

607
00:36:02,334 --> 00:36:04,400
YOU GOTTA WATCH
A MAN A WHILE

608
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
TILL YOU SEE WHAT
HIS WORD COUNTS FOR.

609
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,400
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME COMPANY?

610
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,100
NO.

611
00:36:11,901 --> 00:36:14,968
SAY WE VALUE THE LOT
AT 1,000,

612
00:36:14,968 --> 00:36:18,267
YOU BOYS GIVE ME 500
AND WHATEVER YOU SHOULD
PUT THAT TENT TO

613
00:36:18,267 --> 00:36:20,934
BETWEEN NOW
AND THE FIRST SNOW.
I'M IN FOR HALF THE NET.

614
00:36:20,934 --> 00:36:23,934
COME OCTOBER,
WE FINISH THE DEAL KNOWING
EACH OTHER BETTER.

615
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:27,601
SETH WON'T ACCEPT IT,
MR. SWEARENGEN.

616
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:29,334
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
HIS PROXY.

617
00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:30,801
JUST UP TO A POINT.

618
00:36:30,801 --> 00:36:33,067
SEE, THAT AIN'T
MY SENSE OF PROXY.

619
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:35,100
THAT'S WHAT I'D WANT
THESE FEW MONTHS FOR

620
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,767
TILL WE AGREED
WHAT THINGS MEANT.

621
00:36:36,767 --> 00:36:39,801
I'M TELLING YOU,
WE'RE A HARDWARE OPERATION.

622
00:36:39,801 --> 00:36:41,501
YOU HEARD MY OFFER.

623
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:56,300
HE DIDN'T WANNA DRINK
AND HE DIDN'T WANNA FUCK.

624
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,934
ANYONE OR JUST YOU?

625
00:36:59,834 --> 00:37:02,934
WE PAY 500 NOW.
HE GETS 50% OF OUR NET
TILL THE FIRST SNOW.

626
00:37:02,934 --> 00:37:05,334
- THEN WE BUY OUT THE REST
OF HIS INTEREST.
- NO.

627
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:07,634
IT'S A GREAT LOCATION.
HE WANTS TO BE SURE

628
00:37:07,634 --> 00:37:09,801
WE DON'T TURN TO GAMBLING
OR THAT HICKOK'S WITH US.

629
00:37:09,801 --> 00:37:12,434
- I WON'T BE PARTNERS.
- WE WOULDN'T BE AFTER
OCTOBER.

630
00:37:12,434 --> 00:37:15,467
I WON'T BE PARTNERS.

631
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:17,801
TRIXIE.

632
00:37:17,801 --> 00:37:20,200
SEE, YOU GOT TRIXIE
ALL DISTRESSED.

633
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,167
- SHE WANTED
TO GIVE YOU A RIDE.
- 1,000, NOW!

634
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:25,100
IF ANYONE IN THAT TENT
OR THE BUILDING WE PUT UP

635
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,934
TURNS A PLAYING CARD,
OR POURS A DRINK,

636
00:37:26,934 --> 00:37:30,567
OR OFFERS A WOMAN'S
SERVICES, YOU GET TITLE BACK
AND KEEP OUR MONEY.

637
00:37:30,567 --> 00:37:34,200
WHAT MAKES YOU TALK TO ME
IN THAT TONE OF VOICE?

638
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,567
I'M MAKING
A COUNTER-OFFER.

639
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:39,000
YOU COME INTO CAMP,
RENT MY LOT,

TO SELL YOU THE LOT,

643
00:37:45,501 --> 00:37:48,868
PUT YOU IN BUSINESS
WITHOUT ASKING WHO YOU ARE

644
00:37:48,868 --> 00:37:51,634
OR WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE?

645
00:37:51,634 --> 00:37:53,634
FAR AS WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE STREET

646
00:37:53,634 --> 00:37:55,534
WITH BILL HICKOK
BEING INVOLVED,

647
00:37:55,534 --> 00:37:57,634
THAT WAS A TURN
OF EVENTS.

648
00:37:57,634 --> 00:37:59,234
A WHAT?

649
00:37:59,234 --> 00:38:01,901
IT WAS A TURN
OF EVENTS.

650
00:38:01,901 --> 00:38:03,901
OH, A TURN OF EVENTS.

651
00:38:03,901 --> 00:38:06,467
YOUR PARTNER CALLS
IT A COINCIDENCE.

652
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:09,234
SO WHAT WITH THIS COINCIDENCE
AND TURN OF EVENTS

653
00:38:09,234 --> 00:38:11,901
STARING ME IN THE FACE
AND FIVE OTHER THINGS

654
00:38:11,901 --> 00:38:14,300
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE PAYING
ATTENTION TO,

655
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,300
I STILL MAKE YOU
A SENSIBLE PROPOSAL

656
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,567
AND YOU ANSWER
BY INSULTING ME
IN MY OWN JOINT.

657
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:19,968
SETH DIDN'T MEAN
TO INSULT YOU.

658
00:38:19,968 --> 00:38:21,801
YOU DON'T KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT THIS.

659
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:23,968
YOU WEREN'T HERE,
YOU DON'T HAVE
HIS PROXY.

660
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,000
SO DO WHATEVER YOU PEOPLE
DO WHEN YOU'RE NOT RUNNING
YOUR MOUTHS OFF

661
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,534
OR CHEATING PEOPLE OUT
OF WHAT THEY EARN BY
CHRISTIAN WORK.

662
00:38:29,534 --> 00:38:32,567
- YOU DON'T WANNA
BE TALKING THAT WAY.
- DON'T TELL ME HOW TO TALK

663
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:34,701
IN MY OWN FUCKING
PLACE!

664
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:38,334
AND HERE'S MY COUNTER-OFFER
TO YOUR COUNTER-OFFER.

665
00:38:38,334 --> 00:38:41,334
GO FUCK YOURSELF!

666
00:38:43,067 --> 00:38:44,801
COME HERE, SETH.

667
00:38:48,501 --> 00:38:50,334
Sol:
SETH.

668
00:38:50,334 --> 00:38:52,667
GET HIM AWAY
FROM ME.

669
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:54,934
MISTER.

670
00:38:54,934 --> 00:38:58,300
THE BEST BATH
AND BLOWJOB YOU EVER HAD'S

671
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,234
NOT 12 STEPS
UP THEM STAIRS.

672
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,968
Trixie:
 <i>MISTER!</i>

673
00:39:12,801 --> 00:39:14,834
Brom:
 <i>I MAY AS WELL</i>
 <i>CONFIDE IN YOU, ALMA.</i>

674
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:16,467
OF COURSE.

675
00:39:16,467 --> 00:39:18,601
I'M BEGINNING TO FEEL
WE'VE BEEN DUPED.

676
00:39:18,601 --> 00:39:20,534
 <i>OUR GOLD CLAIM</i>
 <i>MAY BE WORTHLESS.</i>

677
00:39:20,534 --> 00:39:23,000
I'M BEGINNING
TO THINK THAT EVEN

678
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,601
SWEARENGEN'S
NAME SHOULD BE ADDED
TO THE CONSPIRATORS' LIST.

679
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:29,334
- HOW DISAPPOINTED
YOU MUST BE.
- I KNOW.

680
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:31,901
I TOLD YOU I'D BELIEVED
I'D FOUND A FRIEND IN AL.

681
00:39:31,901 --> 00:39:33,801
AS I NOW LOOK BACK,

682
00:39:33,801 --> 00:39:36,501
AL NOT ONLY PRESIDED
THE SALE,

683
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:39,167
HE FACILITATED
MY INVOLVEMENT
AT EVERY TURN.

684
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:41,834
WELL, I SUPPOSE
A COMMUNITY SUCH AS THIS

685
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:45,501
ATTRACTS A CERTAIN
KIND OF MAN.

686
00:39:45,501 --> 00:39:50,501
I'VE MENTIONED TO YOU
EXCHANGING HELLOS

687
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:52,968
WITH WILD BILL HICKOK
IN THE HOTEL HALLWAY?

688
00:39:52,968 --> 00:39:56,033
YES, YOU SAID HE SEEMED
VERY FRIENDLY.

689
00:39:56,033 --> 00:39:59,434
VERY FRIENDLY.
IN THE HALLWAY AND ON
THE STAIRS.

690
00:39:59,434 --> 00:40:03,367
DO YOU SUPPOSE
WE MIGHT ENLIST HIM
TO OUR CAUSE?

691
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:07,200
DO YOU THINK THAT THAT'S
THE SORT OF THING HE DOES?

692
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,968
FOR A FEE, A PERCENTAGE
OF THE MONIES RECOVERED,

693
00:40:10,968 --> 00:40:13,601
I'D SAY THAT'S
EXACTLY HIS LINE.

694
00:40:13,601 --> 00:40:15,601
HMM.

695
00:40:15,601 --> 00:40:19,601
I MAY WELL INCLUDE
THE NAME OF AL SWEARENGEN

696
00:40:19,601 --> 00:40:21,334
WHEN WILD BILL
AND I CONFER.

697
00:40:21,334 --> 00:40:24,567
Sol:
THIS CAMP IS
A GOING CONCERN.

698
00:40:24,567 --> 00:40:26,534
WE COULD SECURE
OUR FUTURES HERE.

699
00:40:26,534 --> 00:40:29,067
- HARDWARE COULD
JUST BE A START.
- CAMP NEEDS A BANK.

700
00:40:29,067 --> 00:40:32,000
CAMP ALSO NEEDS A BANK
IS EXACTLY RIGHT.

701

SETH.

702
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:36,834
IF YOU SEE ALL
THESE POSSIBILITIES

703
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,934
WHY GET SIDETRACKED
BY THAT SALOON-KEEPER?

704
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:41,767
WE JUST WANNA
BUY HIS LOT.

705
00:40:41,767 --> 00:40:43,634
WHAT ABOUT WHAT
HE CALLED YOU?

706
00:40:43,634 --> 00:40:45,567
I BEEN CALLED
WORSE BY BETTER.

707
00:40:47,868 --> 00:40:50,567
GET IT IN WRITING
FROM THAT SON
OF A BITCH.

708
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:52,601
WE BUY THE OTHER HALF
IN OCTOBER.

709
00:40:52,601 --> 00:40:55,501
- JUST LEAVE IT TO ME.

BILL AND ME DIDN'T
MAKE IT TO YOUR TENT TODAY.

HIS EXPRESS PURPOSE
COMING TO THIS CAMP.

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,234
MAKE A STAKE
FOR HIS NEW WIFE.

HIS IDEA.

718
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:27,634
DON'T SUGGEST
BUYING A SHOVEL
OR A SIFTING CRADLE.

719
00:41:27,634 --> 00:41:28,834
HUH-UH.

LOOK OUT FOR YOURSELF.

HE DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO THAT.

730

 <i>YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?</i>

731
