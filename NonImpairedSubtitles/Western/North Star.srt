1
00:04:28,673 --> 00:04:30,152
Where is Hudson Saanteek?

2
00:04:36,673 --> 00:04:39,824
You have to leave.
You're not supposed to be here.

3
00:04:39,993 --> 00:04:41,312
Not now.

4
00:04:41,473 --> 00:04:42,986
- Please.
- Oh.

5
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:47,103
Don't buy yourself trouble.
I want the man that signed the claim.

6
00:04:47,273 --> 00:04:50,948
Nobody has a claim.
This is a sacred place.

7
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,949
Ask him again, Smiley.

8
00:04:56,393 --> 00:05:00,830
- Jesus, mountain's solid gold.
- So where is he?

9
00:05:00,993 --> 00:05:02,984
Just leave us alone.

10
00:05:03,153 --> 00:05:07,271
This is our grandfather.
We're saying our goodbyes.

11
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:34,185
There. I'll ask you again.

12
00:05:36,313 --> 00:05:38,144
Where is Hudson Saanteek?

13
00:05:46,473 --> 00:05:50,022
- What are you doing here? Get out!
- Hudson!

14
00:05:51,553 --> 00:05:53,384
Don't let him get away.

15
00:05:57,513 --> 00:05:59,629
- Where is he?
- Up there.

16
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:05,706
Come on, this way.

17
00:06:30,193 --> 00:06:31,751
Kill the son of a bitch.

18
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,471
Over there.

19
00:07:31,473 --> 00:07:33,384
Yeehaw!

20
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:35,591
Got him.

21
00:07:46,393 --> 00:07:48,668
- You got him, huh?
- Yeah.

22
00:07:50,473 --> 00:07:54,022
Let's get back to Nome.
I'll buy youse all a nice warm hooker.

23
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,271
Easy.

24
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:00,701
Papa?

25
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,306
Son.

26
00:09:02,473 --> 00:09:03,792
- You've grown.
- You're home.

27
00:09:26,313 --> 00:09:29,623
- Morning, Miss Sarah.
- Good morning.

28
00:09:41,193 --> 00:09:44,105
- I'll take her, Miss Sarah.
- Thank you. 

29
00:09:49,313 --> 00:09:51,781
- Mama.
- What is it?

30
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:55,871
Bjorn.

31
00:09:57,993 --> 00:09:59,585
It's so good to see you.

32
00:09:59,753 --> 00:10:01,345
Hannah.

33
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,142
Can you believe it?

34
00:10:17,153 --> 00:10:18,506
What is it?

35
00:10:19,913 --> 00:10:21,824
This winter,
you'll have a room of your own.

36
00:10:21,993 --> 00:10:24,063
Close your eyes.

37
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:31,743
Can you feel how warm? 
It's gold.

38
00:10:32,393 --> 00:10:34,111
Sold, the Kosoktok mine...

39
00:10:34,273 --> 00:10:35,262
to this lucky man...

40
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:38,549
for $250.

41
00:10:38,713 --> 00:10:41,352
Next up, the North Star Falls.

42
00:10:41,753 --> 00:10:46,622
"Former owner, Hudson Saanteek, deceased."

43
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:51,264
The bidding will start at $200.
Do I hear $200?

44
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:53,867
- Two hundred dollars.
- Two hundred dollars, I have bid.

45
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:56,388
- Do I hear 225?
- Two-twenty-five.

46
00:10:56,553 --> 00:10:59,113
- Two-twenty-five, the man down front.
- Two-fifty.

47
00:10:59,273 --> 00:11:00,547
Three hundred.

48
00:11:00,713 --> 00:11:03,307
- Three-twenty-five.
- Three-twenty-five bid.

49
00:11:03,473 --> 00:11:05,350
Do I hear $400?

50
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:14,832
I don't. No...

51
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:19,623
- Four hundred dollars.
- Four-twenty-five.

52
00:11:20,993 --> 00:11:21,982
Four-fifty.

53
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:25,190
I have bid 450, a man at the back.

54
00:11:26,593 --> 00:11:29,824
- Going once...
- One thousand.

55
00:11:30,793 --> 00:11:33,626
One thousand dollars is the bid.

56
00:11:34,273 --> 00:11:35,911
Going once.

57
00:11:36,313 --> 00:11:37,871
Going twice.

58
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:43,903
Sold to Mr. Sean McLennon,
new owner of the North Star claim.

59
00:11:46,393 --> 00:11:49,305
I'm, uh, very sorry about that.

60
00:11:49,473 --> 00:11:52,192
It seems I've edged you out
by just a smidgen.

61
00:11:55,353 --> 00:11:57,105
Mr. Hanson.

62
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:08,187
Bjorn, wait for us.

63
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,390
- Come on, hurry up.
- Come on, Jesper.

64
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:26,662
I want to claim a stake.

65
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,346
You mean, stake a claim?

66
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,551
Yes. That.

67
00:12:38,153 --> 00:12:41,111
- Name?
- Bjorn Svenson.

68
00:12:44,913 --> 00:12:46,869
Where's this claim at?

69
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:54,792
Here.

70
00:12:55,473 --> 00:12:56,542
Proof of citizenship?

71
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:02,031
- I'm Swedish.
- I'm sorry, Mr., uh, "Svenson."

72
00:13:02,193 --> 00:13:05,981
Unless you're an American citizen,
I have to deny your claim.

73
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:09,629
What? I-- I don't...

74
00:13:10,153 --> 00:13:13,509
- What do you mean?
- According to the Miner's Association...

75
00:13:13,673 --> 00:13:17,188
foreigners can no longer stake claims
on American land.

76
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:19,422
But it's my claim.

77
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,750
I've been digging for eight months.
That's why I came here.

78
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:26,591
I'm sorry, it's not my rule.

79
00:13:30,873 --> 00:13:32,022
Give me my map.

80
00:13:32,193 --> 00:13:35,549
I'm sorry, it is now the property of
the North American Miner's Association.

81
00:13:36,593 --> 00:13:40,222
- Give me my map.
- Mr. Svenson.

82
00:13:41,673 --> 00:13:43,743
- Don't you jump my claim.
- Bjorn.

83
00:13:51,273 --> 00:13:55,152
Hey. Hey. What's going on here?

84
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:59,312
They said,
foreigners can't make claims here.

85
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:00,588
- They stole my map.
- Who?

86
00:14:00,753 --> 00:14:02,664
- Who?
- He.

87
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,063
That's against the law.

88
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:08,823
We're only following
Miner's Association rules, Lindberg.

89
00:14:08,993 --> 00:14:12,349
If you wanna complain,
you know where to go.

90
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:15,103
All right, come on.

91
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:37,148
- Where's McLennon?
- Who?

92
00:14:37,313 --> 00:14:40,350
- The owner, your boss.
- Oh, McLennon.

93
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,424
I haven't seen him.

94
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:45,344
Where's McLennon?

95
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:50,666
Yes? Gentlemen, can I help you?

96
00:14:51,753 --> 00:14:54,267
How dare you deny these men
their claims?

97
00:14:55,593 --> 00:14:58,187
Oh, I see, you, um--
You think this is a claims office.

98
00:14:58,353 --> 00:14:59,468
It's true. This is a bar.

99
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:02,227
This man was denied his claim
because he was not a citizen.

100
00:15:02,393 --> 00:15:05,191
After eight months of digging.
Do you think that's just?

101
00:15:05,953 --> 00:15:09,343
Well, according to the
Miner's Association, yes, it is just.

102
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,630
You are the Miner's Association.

103
00:15:13,553 --> 00:15:15,748
Yes, that's true. 
I am the president.

104
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:18,622
And as the president,
it is my duty to inform you...

105
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,865
we are about to a meeting 
which will declare all foreign claims...

106
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:24,228
- void and illegal.
- No, no, you can't do that.

107
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,346
You can't do this.
What's the matter with you?

108
00:15:27,513 --> 00:15:28,502
What?

109
00:15:28,673 --> 00:15:31,745
Without their claims these men
will freeze to death on the beaches.

110
00:15:32,513 --> 00:15:34,151
Nobody asked them to come to Nome.

111
00:15:34,313 --> 00:15:36,031
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's right. 

112
00:15:36,193 --> 00:15:37,865
Move, go home.

113
00:15:42,113 --> 00:15:43,102
No.

114
00:15:43,273 --> 00:15:45,833
Have you seen a man freeze to death,
Mr. McLennon?

115
00:15:45,993 --> 00:15:48,871
A frozen man,
or the actual freezing process?

116
00:15:50,793 --> 00:15:52,112
No, I don't.

117
00:15:52,273 --> 00:15:55,470
Because the actual freezing process 
is quite something to see.

118
00:15:55,633 --> 00:15:57,749
The body's natural instinct
is to fall asleep...

119
00:15:57,913 --> 00:15:59,266
but, anyway...

120
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:03,832
first, uh, the joints and the tendons
contract into little knots...

121
00:16:03,993 --> 00:16:06,461
and then your extremities...

122
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:10,023
you, know, your nose,
your fingers, your sex organs...

123
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:16,188
they get frostbitten and fall off.

124
00:16:16,353 --> 00:16:19,231
Then your breathing shuts off
and you asphyxiate, it's terrible.

125
00:16:19,393 --> 00:16:21,668
Do you expect these men will stand by...

126
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,666
and watch this happen to their wives
and children, do you?

127
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,347
- I expect these men to go home.
- We ain't going home.

128
00:16:27,513 --> 00:16:28,866
We are up front with you.

129
00:16:29,513 --> 00:16:32,232
May the words of a fellow Scot--

130
00:16:32,393 --> 00:16:35,385
I, of course, was born here.

131
00:16:35,753 --> 00:16:37,345
But a Mr. Macbeth said:

132
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:42,633
"When our actions do not,
our fears do make us traitors."

133
00:16:43,593 --> 00:16:45,231
I have no fear to tell the truth...

134
00:16:45,393 --> 00:16:48,624
which is that I don't care
if you people freeze to death.

135
00:16:48,793 --> 00:16:51,307
Because as far as I am concerned,
you're trespassing.

136
00:16:51,473 --> 00:16:52,952
This is disgusting.

137
00:16:54,273 --> 00:16:56,070
Damn you. How dare you?

138
00:16:56,793 --> 00:17:00,672
You are stealing from the people
to whom this country belongs.

139
00:17:01,073 --> 00:17:04,110
So you see? 
It's either your lives or ours.

140
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,992
Well, that's not a hard decision 
to make, is it?

141
00:17:08,273 --> 00:17:11,868
- You son of a bitch.
- Reno. Smiley.

142
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:15,907
No.

143
00:17:18,953 --> 00:17:23,390
If you going to take my claim,
you'll have to kill me like all the others.

144
00:17:23,873 --> 00:17:25,511
And why not do it now?

145
00:17:26,673 --> 00:17:29,141
Come on, get them out of here.
Get these guys out.

146
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,112
Get him.

147
00:17:32,673 --> 00:17:34,026
Get out, now.

148
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:36,351
Hey, you, get up.

149
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:40,552
- Come on. You heard me.
- No, I didn't.

150
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:44,392
Here we go.

151
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:48,703
Goddamn. Goddamn, I'll kill you.

152
00:17:48,873 --> 00:17:51,228
- Hey, hey, you.
- Get him out of here.

153
00:17:53,193 --> 00:17:56,708
Get him, come on.
Get him out. Get him out.

154
00:17:58,673 --> 00:18:01,062
McLennon. Go home.

155
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:13,069
- Go home.
- Just leave. 

156
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,662
You dogs.

157
00:18:45,713 --> 00:18:47,590
Hey. Halt.

158
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:50,392
- What the hell's happening?
- These men are stealing from us.

159
00:18:50,553 --> 00:18:52,384
They're thieves.

160
00:18:59,913 --> 00:19:04,065
- Well, that's better.
- McLennon, what's happening here?

161
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:08,112
These foreigners came into my saloon
and started tearing the place apart.

162
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:11,549
- Liar. You started this.
- Let's have some order here.

163
00:19:11,713 --> 00:19:14,386
Order? You call this order?

164
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:18,626
- He's planning to take over all our claims.
- Take it easy.

165
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:21,148
He's starting a war.

166
00:19:21,313 --> 00:19:24,385
- Look, I'll handle this.
- You will?

167
00:19:29,593 --> 00:19:33,142
You may own the town, McLennon,
but you don't own me.

168
00:19:39,273 --> 00:19:40,991
We'll be back, McLennon.

169
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:47,470
Don't fight, Bjorn.
Come on. Come on, let's go. Go.

170
00:19:54,113 --> 00:19:55,751
McLennon.

171
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:59,270
I'm gonna have to report this
to Colonel Johnson.

172
00:20:00,553 --> 00:20:02,464
A barroom brawl?

173
00:20:02,793 --> 00:20:07,548
It seems like a local matter to me, but
if it's a little too big for you, sheriff...

174
00:20:07,713 --> 00:20:11,262
McLennon,
I'm not gonna have violence here.

175
00:20:12,273 --> 00:20:16,312
These foreigners, they ain't gonna stand by 
and watch you wipe out their claims.

176
00:20:16,473 --> 00:20:20,830
And between you and me,
Congress ain't gonna approve it either.

177
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,192
And there's talk about an audit
of the Claims Office.

178
00:20:24,353 --> 00:20:27,425
I'm sorry, Sean,
I gonna have to report this.

179
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:31,066
Well...

180
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:33,349
Sheriff, I guess you gotta do
what you gotta do.

181
00:20:39,353 --> 00:20:42,311
Reno, Smiley, come on,
we got work to do.

182
00:21:07,273 --> 00:21:08,911
<i>You brought the white man here.</i>

183
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,270
They killed my grandfather 
because of you.

184
00:21:14,713 --> 00:21:16,465
I'm sorry.

185
00:21:17,993 --> 00:21:19,426
But I had nothing to do with it.

186
00:21:20,193 --> 00:21:23,344
- Why did you steal our cave?
- I didn't steal anything.

187
00:21:23,513 --> 00:21:26,152
Why do they say it's yours then? Why?

188
00:21:26,313 --> 00:21:29,544
- I claimed it to protect it.
- You claimed it for the gold.

189
00:21:33,513 --> 00:21:37,188
As long as I have this,
the cave is still yours.

190
00:21:37,353 --> 00:21:39,548
We don't need you
to protect what's ours.

191
00:21:39,713 --> 00:21:41,544
You can't protect yourself from them.

192
00:21:41,993 --> 00:21:47,590
I know these men. They crave gold.
To them, it's just another mountain.

193
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:56,230
Sooner or later, they would have come
to find and destroy it.

194
00:21:57,353 --> 00:22:01,869
And you are half of one of them.
And you will destroy us.

195
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:17,950
How do you know?

196
00:22:44,993 --> 00:22:46,790
Besides...

197
00:22:47,273 --> 00:22:48,911
they think I'm dead.

198
00:23:07,313 --> 00:23:09,190
Goodbye, uncle.

199
00:23:58,273 --> 00:24:02,505
<i>"Normann Olsen, deceased.

00:24:52,753 --> 00:24:54,266
Damn.

206
00:25:10,273 --> 00:25:12,309
What is it, Smiley?

207
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,429
We got a problem.

208
00:25:18,953 --> 00:25:20,784
Not now.

209
00:25:23,113 --> 00:25:25,069
A big problem.

210
00:25:32,273 --> 00:25:34,628
- Sean, what the--?
- Big time gunfighter, huh?

211
00:25:34,793 --> 00:25:37,182
- What do you want?
- Just some broken-down bum.

212
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:39,232
Get out.

213
00:25:39,393 --> 00:25:41,668
Get out, now. Now.

214
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:48,631
He's dead, huh?

215
00:25:50,353 --> 00:25:51,422
The guy's dead?

216
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:55,108
Hey, I saw the Indian. 
He's alive.

217
00:25:55,753 --> 00:25:59,302
I bought that mine because I thought
you could do something besides this.

218
00:25:59,473 --> 00:26:00,747
Now, I'm in deep shit.

219
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:02,308
Deep shit.

220
00:26:03,273 --> 00:26:06,151
I want that half-breed dead.

221
00:26:07,273 --> 00:26:08,911
You're a bum.

222
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:18,949
I thought you shot him.

223
00:26:19,713 --> 00:26:22,625
Hey, maybe I missed. I, uh--

224
00:26:25,353 --> 00:26:28,231
Square piece of garbage.

225
00:26:44,073 --> 00:26:45,984
My Sarah.

226
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,711

and sing them loud
even in the dead of night."

<i>Twelfth Night.</i>

00:27:06,713 --> 00:27:09,466
"Shout your name

00:27:09,633 --> 00:27:13,421
and make the babbling gossip of the air
cry out, "Olivia!"

234
00:27:13,793 --> 00:27:17,502
O, you should not rest
between the elements of the air and earth...

235
00:27:17,673 --> 00:27:19,903
but you should pity me."

236
00:27:27,393 --> 00:27:29,953
No way he's still in town.

237
00:27:30,113 --> 00:27:33,583
I'll go back and burn down
the whole goddamn Indian village.

Goddamn, I killed that Indian.

242
00:28:33,513 --> 00:28:35,071
You've gone too far, McLennon.

243
00:28:35,793 --> 00:28:37,863
You want the cave?

244
00:28:38,033 --> 00:28:39,625
Deal with me.

245
00:28:40,073 --> 00:28:42,712
Leave the Indians alone.

246
00:28:42,953 --> 00:28:44,705
You got that?

247
00:28:46,273 --> 00:28:48,707
They have nothing to do with it.

248
00:28:48,873 --> 00:28:51,751
It's just between you and me.

249
00:28:51,913 --> 00:28:53,232
Get away from him.

250
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,988
Get out! Get out!

251
00:29:01,393 --> 00:29:03,543

00:29:07,273 --> 00:29:09,833
Reno! Someone--

253
00:29:14,633 --> 00:29:18,148
Quick, help!
Quick, someone's attacked Sean.

254
00:29:22,593 --> 00:29:24,311
Stay here.

255
00:29:34,593 --> 00:29:35,787
Help, Smiley, quick!

256
00:29:36,633 --> 00:29:39,101
Help me, help! Get off.

257
00:29:39,273 --> 00:29:41,184
- Don't move.
- Reno, please!

258
00:29:41,353 --> 00:29:44,982
- Put your guns down, I'll kill her.
- Reno! Reno!

259
00:29:45,553 --> 00:29:48,386
Let me go. Stop!

260
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:52,671
Get off me. They'll kill you.
Will you get off?

261
00:29:54,433 --> 00:29:56,025
- What's going on?
- You gotta help me.

262
00:29:56,193 --> 00:29:59,947
- What are you doing with her?
- What are you doing? That's my sled.

263
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:06,147
Help! Help!

264
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:10,949
- Stop, don't shoot!
- Sean, help!

265
00:30:11,113 --> 00:30:12,592
No.

266
00:30:16,593 --> 00:30:19,107
Sean!

267
00:30:19,273 --> 00:30:21,628
Get the sleds ready
and get the goddamn tracker.

268
00:30:21,793 --> 00:30:23,863
- You mean, the Indian?
- Yeah, the Indian.

269
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:33,186
Make sure Sean's sled's ready.

270
00:30:34,153 --> 00:30:36,906
- You forming a posse?
- No, going fishing.

271
00:30:37,073 --> 00:30:38,426
Don't forget his rifle.

272
00:30:39,313 --> 00:30:42,908
- Of course we're forming a posse.
- Any money in it?

273
00:30:43,073 --> 00:30:44,552
You two help get the girl back...

274
00:30:44,713 --> 00:30:47,466
I'll make sure you never look 
at another mine.

275
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,502
All right.

276
00:30:49,673 --> 00:30:52,949
- You can't go alone.
- Hey, Annie. Annie, we're gonna be rich.

277
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:55,622
Stay down.

278
00:30:57,753 --> 00:31:00,221
Please, someone help!

279
00:31:00,393 --> 00:31:02,987
- Help, somebody, help!
- Shut up.

280
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,666
- Stop!
- Stay down.

281
00:31:12,793 --> 00:31:14,784
- Hold on, McLennon.
- You're late, aren't you?

282
00:31:14,953 --> 00:31:17,387
You know, a posse ain't legal
without the law behind it.

283
00:31:17,553 --> 00:31:18,952
Stay and do your job.

284
00:31:19,913 --> 00:31:23,508
- Hyah, hyah, hyah.
- Hyah, hyah.

285
00:31:34,233 --> 00:31:36,747
- Come on, let's go.
- I'm coming.

286
00:31:53,793 --> 00:31:56,512
Halt! Stop!

287
00:31:58,313 --> 00:31:59,302
Come back!

288
00:32:01,873 --> 00:32:03,147
Smoke!

289
00:32:11,273 --> 00:32:13,229
Come back!

290
00:32:13,393 --> 00:32:16,112
Help! Help!

291
00:32:23,993 --> 00:32:25,949
Where are you running to?

292
00:32:26,793 --> 00:32:27,942
There's nowhere to go.

293
00:32:28,673 --> 00:32:32,382
Give me your hand. 
Give me your hand.

294
00:32:32,553 --> 00:32:34,111
I won't hurt you.

295
00:32:47,073 --> 00:32:49,029
Hold on to me.

296
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,867
Go, go!

297
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,385
Come on! Hyah! Hyah!

298
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,022
Stop!

299
00:33:18,473 --> 00:33:21,863
- Please, sir.
- Hey, hang on.

300
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,910
Please, hang on.

301
00:33:24,233 --> 00:33:26,110
Oh, God. Please.

302
00:33:26,273 --> 00:33:28,662
I'll take you to someplace warm.

303
00:34:22,633 --> 00:34:24,749
What's going on?

304
00:34:25,033 --> 00:34:27,945
The girl jumped out, 
she ran down there.

305
00:34:28,113 --> 00:34:30,547
He brought her back, then continued.

306
00:34:30,713 --> 00:34:33,989
- I can't wait to kill that Indian.
- He's not an Indian, he's a half-breed.

307
00:34:34,153 --> 00:34:37,429
- What's the difference?
- Let's go.

308
00:35:03,593 --> 00:35:06,585
- We don't want you here.
- Help me.

309
00:35:08,553 --> 00:35:10,350
- You bring nothing but trouble.
- Leave me alone!

310
00:35:10,513 --> 00:35:11,531
White man's trouble.

311
00:35:12,393 --> 00:35:15,544
- Help me.
- You bring death. 

312
00:35:41,993 --> 00:35:44,587
Don't worry, she'll take care of you.

313
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,790
White men.

314
00:37:36,553 --> 00:37:39,829
- We have to go.
- Don't touch me.

315
00:37:39,993 --> 00:37:42,302
If you stay here, 
they will kill everyone.

316
00:37:42,473 --> 00:37:44,623
- Let's go, come on.
- Don't touch me.

317
00:37:44,793 --> 00:37:46,351
Let's go.

318
00:37:48,873 --> 00:37:49,862
Let me go.

319
00:37:51,913 --> 00:37:53,710
- Come on.
- No, no!

320
00:37:53,873 --> 00:37:55,272
- Quick.
- Yap-yap-yap.

321
00:38:59,113 --> 00:39:01,024
- He says he didn't--
- I know what he said.

322
00:39:04,033 --> 00:39:05,671
I can see it in his lying face.

323
00:39:07,633 --> 00:39:08,861
Go look for tracks.

324
00:39:51,073 --> 00:39:54,748
I found tracks.
We go while they're still fresh.

325
00:40:23,193 --> 00:40:26,151
Hey, wake up.

326
00:40:26,313 --> 00:40:28,224
Wake up!

327
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:30,509
Stop!

328
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:39,585
Wake up!

329
00:40:39,753 --> 00:40:41,869
Wake up!

330
00:40:43,753 --> 00:40:48,065
Don't sleep. 
Wake up, wake up! Hyah!

331
00:40:48,233 --> 00:40:51,464
Hyah, yap-yap, yap-yap.

332
00:44:10,753 --> 00:44:13,506
I just hate this goddamn snow.

333
00:44:18,433 --> 00:44:19,912
Christ.

334
00:44:24,993 --> 00:44:28,429
You mean all this time
we've been chasing an empty sled?

335
00:44:29,353 --> 00:44:33,028
He's been dragging us along
behind a goddamn empty sled.

336
00:44:34,233 --> 00:44:36,383
I should have known,
you goddamn Indian.

337
00:44:36,553 --> 00:44:39,431
What are you trying to do, kill us?

338
00:44:42,553 --> 00:44:44,748
- I'll kill him, I'Il--
- Smiley, take it easy.

339
00:44:44,913 --> 00:44:46,665
Come on.

340
00:44:47,113 --> 00:44:51,072
No, we shouldn't trust him.
I'm gonna kill the son of a bitch.

341
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:53,303
I'm gonna shoot his red ass off.

342
00:44:54,433 --> 00:44:56,389
You're gonna shoot him, eh?

343
00:44:56,553 --> 00:44:58,464
The same way you shot the half-breed?

344
00:44:58,633 --> 00:45:01,101
Come on, Reno. 
He's just an Indian.

345
00:45:01,273 --> 00:45:05,391
Go ahead, half-wit.
I bet he drops you right here.

346
00:45:06,033 --> 00:45:08,866
I thought we were business partners,
I thought we were friends.

347
00:45:09,033 --> 00:45:12,025
Friends? You shitbreath.

348
00:45:12,473 --> 00:45:14,270
I'll kill you for that, Reno.

349
00:45:14,433 --> 00:45:17,152
- I'll kill you for that.
- So shoot, goddamn it.

350
00:45:17,873 --> 00:45:20,706
Shoot! You killed the half-breed,
we wouldn't be here.

351
00:45:20,873 --> 00:45:23,433
Go ahead, shoot everybody.
I'm looking forward to hell.

352
00:45:26,553 --> 00:45:28,589
He's just an Indian.

353
00:45:30,273 --> 00:45:33,151
What's wrong with you?
He's just an Indian.

354
00:45:34,473 --> 00:45:37,465
Goddamn it. Goddamn them.

355
00:45:37,633 --> 00:45:41,831
Goddamn that dog.

356
00:45:41,993 --> 00:45:44,268
Goddamn that dog.

357
00:45:44,433 --> 00:45:46,628
- Goddamn Indian.
- He's crazy.

358
00:45:46,793 --> 00:45:49,910
I'll kill them. Everything.

359
00:45:50,633 --> 00:45:52,544
Goddamn.

360
00:45:52,713 --> 00:45:54,271
Goddamn.

361
00:46:06,633 --> 00:46:09,625
Nobody dies until I tell them to die.

362
00:46:35,513 --> 00:46:36,502
You should eat.

363
00:46:38,193 --> 00:46:39,831
Please?

364
00:46:50,673 --> 00:46:54,143
- I didn't mean to harm anyone.
- Well, you did.

365
00:46:57,353 --> 00:46:59,344
I had no choice.

366
00:47:00,553 --> 00:47:02,111
They were trying to kill me.

367
00:47:06,353 --> 00:47:09,390
- You tried to kill Sean.
- No, I didn't.

368
00:47:09,553 --> 00:47:11,225
Yes, you did.

369
00:47:12,673 --> 00:47:15,028
I tried to talk to him.

370
00:47:16,913 --> 00:47:18,983
With a knife to his throat?

371
00:47:20,193 --> 00:47:23,105
I told him to stay away
from the North Star.

372
00:47:28,193 --> 00:47:30,263
The North Star?

373
00:47:32,753 --> 00:47:33,981
Well, that's his.

374
00:47:35,273 --> 00:47:39,471
- It doesn't belong to him.
- Yes, it does. He bought it.

375
00:47:42,433 --> 00:47:43,752
Because the owner died?

376
00:47:45,233 --> 00:47:46,632
Exactly.

377
00:47:48,993 --> 00:47:50,585
Well, I am the owner.

378
00:47:51,753 --> 00:47:53,983
Do I look dead to you?

379
00:48:00,073 --> 00:48:02,143
The North Star belongs 
to those Indians...

380
00:48:02,313 --> 00:48:05,430
who gave you warm clothing
when you were freezing.

381
00:48:05,593 --> 00:48:09,188
I filed a claim 
to protect them from McLennon.

382
00:49:05,913 --> 00:49:08,302
I'm Henry Pruett Johnson.

383
00:49:08,473 --> 00:49:11,271
Colonel of the United States Army,
Fort Michael.

384
00:49:11,753 --> 00:49:15,871
Military commander
for the territory of Alaska.

385
00:49:16,993 --> 00:49:21,509
As of this moment,
the town of Nome is under martial law.

386
00:49:26,193 --> 00:49:28,912
So you see, it's not that simple.

387
00:49:31,033 --> 00:49:34,423
- I'm sorry, but I don't believe you.
- What?

388
00:49:34,593 --> 00:49:37,903
I mean, Sean isn't like that.
He cares for me.

389
00:49:39,313 --> 00:49:40,712
He's not what you think.

390
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,992
You haven't listened to anything.

391
00:49:45,033 --> 00:49:47,991
You don't understand
why I'm doing this.

392
00:49:48,153 --> 00:49:50,269
No, you're right, I don't.

393
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:54,583
- I don't think you're being honest.
- Honest?

394
00:49:54,753 --> 00:49:57,062
What do you know about me?

395
00:50:02,113 --> 00:50:05,389
You just think of me
as a half-breed and a thief.

396
00:50:05,553 --> 00:50:07,271
No, I don't.

397
00:50:07,553 --> 00:50:11,512
I mean, what are you hoping to prove
from all this?

398
00:50:12,113 --> 00:50:15,992
That cave is sacred, like a church.

399
00:50:16,153 --> 00:50:19,065
And McLennon's men defiled it.

400
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:22,703
They killed an old man
who was like a father to me.

401
00:50:22,873 --> 00:50:25,671
And I could do nothing to stop them.

402
00:50:27,393 --> 00:50:28,621
That man had my respect...

403
00:50:28,793 --> 00:50:32,388
because he taught me as a child
about right and wrong.

404
00:50:32,553 --> 00:50:34,748
And if I can save that cave...

405
00:50:35,553 --> 00:50:39,751
then I can be honest with myself
about who I am.

406
00:50:53,273 --> 00:50:54,262
What are you gonna do?

407
00:50:58,033 --> 00:51:02,629
- Look, I'll talk to Sean--
- Sean, he'll be here sooner or later.

408
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:04,431
And do his best to kill me.

409
00:51:07,433 --> 00:51:09,469
Do you understand that?

410
00:51:09,993 --> 00:51:13,190
You don't know him.
Look, he'll listen to me.

411
00:51:17,193 --> 00:51:19,661
Why are you trying to help me?

412
00:51:23,153 --> 00:51:26,031
You could have let me die out there
and you didn't.

413
00:51:27,033 --> 00:51:29,149
We'll leave tomorrow.

414
00:51:29,593 --> 00:51:31,743
Before they get here.

415
00:51:32,353 --> 00:51:33,866
Where to?

416
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:36,391
Nome.

417
00:51:41,153 --> 00:51:46,625
Sean McLennon, owns 10, now 11
of the richest strikes on Anvil Creek...

418
00:51:46,793 --> 00:51:49,387
and he didn't file the original claim
on one of them.

419
00:51:50,753 --> 00:51:54,826
Nothing wrong with transferring a claim.
Happens all the time.

420
00:51:55,753 --> 00:52:00,429
The original owners of McLennon's transfers 
are all dead.

421
00:52:02,313 --> 00:52:04,873
Here. And here.

422
00:52:14,793 --> 00:52:16,351
Here, this Indian.

423
00:52:16,513 --> 00:52:19,903
Eyewitnesses saw him alive,
here in town.

424
00:52:20,273 --> 00:52:23,185
That makes things a little 
more slippery now, doesn't it?

425
00:52:23,353 --> 00:52:25,662
I'd say a lot more.

426
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:31,789
Well, you best find him, 
and the girl.

427
00:52:33,713 --> 00:52:36,227
- Well, now, this matter really--
- Sheriff.

428
00:52:36,393 --> 00:52:38,623
Take three of my men
and go after that posse.

429
00:52:39,313 --> 00:52:41,349
Inform them of the martial law decree.

430
00:52:41,993 --> 00:52:44,712
And order them
to return to Nome immediately.

431
00:53:36,793 --> 00:53:37,942
- Get up, get up.
- Hmm?

432
00:53:38,113 --> 00:53:40,581
- Why?
- Get dressed, they're here.

433
00:54:28,953 --> 00:54:29,942
No!

434
00:54:32,873 --> 00:54:34,226
Sean.

435
00:54:41,993 --> 00:54:44,223
Sean, listen. 
You have to listen to me.

436
00:54:45,353 --> 00:54:46,627
You have to--

437
00:54:46,793 --> 00:54:49,910
- Kill him.
- No!

438
00:54:50,513 --> 00:54:51,866
No!

439
00:54:53,633 --> 00:54:55,146
Tell them to stop, please.

440
00:54:59,113 --> 00:55:00,990
No, Sean, you can't.
You mustn't shoot him.

441
00:55:01,153 --> 00:55:02,472
No, Sean, please.

442
00:55:03,273 --> 00:55:05,992
Stop it! Stop, stop shooting.

443
00:55:06,153 --> 00:55:08,064
Please, please, stop it!

444
00:55:14,313 --> 00:55:15,302
Out of the way.

445
00:55:20,993 --> 00:55:21,982
Blow him up.

446
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:32,068
Sean, please. 
He didn't mean any harm.

447
00:55:32,233 --> 00:55:35,987
He just wants to talk to you.
He told me.

448
00:55:40,353 --> 00:55:42,071
What are you wearing?

449
00:55:42,393 --> 00:55:44,224
What did you do with him?

450
00:55:45,193 --> 00:55:49,471
You fucking whore. You whore!

451
00:55:52,233 --> 00:55:56,067
I don't know what you're thinking.
How can you say that to me?

452
00:56:39,273 --> 00:56:42,470
Gwill! Gwill!

453
00:56:46,633 --> 00:56:49,431
Oh, no. Jesus Christ.

454
00:56:58,473 --> 00:56:59,462
He's getting away.

455
00:57:02,473 --> 00:57:05,146
Kill him! Put the dogs on him.

456
00:57:13,073 --> 00:57:17,191
Please, please, Sean. I don't know
what's wrong with you. Please, please.

457
00:57:18,593 --> 00:57:22,029
Please. Please, Sean,
just take me back to Nome, please.

458
00:57:23,113 --> 00:57:25,343
Please, Sean.
Just take me back to Nome, please.

459
00:57:25,513 --> 00:57:29,222
- Take me back to Nome, please.
- Let me take her back.

460
00:57:29,393 --> 00:57:30,826
Please.

461
00:57:32,713 --> 00:57:33,987
What?

462
00:57:34,153 --> 00:57:37,828
I'll take her back. 
She'll freeze out here.

463
00:57:40,633 --> 00:57:44,023
I mean, I gotta take
Gwill's body back, anyway.

464
00:57:46,353 --> 00:57:48,389
I mean, a posse 
ain't no place for a woman.

465
00:57:51,793 --> 00:57:53,511
All right?

466
00:57:55,913 --> 00:57:57,312
Yeah.

467
00:57:58,993 --> 00:58:00,790
Yeah, that's great.

468
00:58:02,073 --> 00:58:03,631
Why don--

469
00:58:04,153 --> 00:58:07,111
Why don't you take her back 
to your sled and you keep her--

470
00:58:07,273 --> 00:58:08,991
You keep her warm.

471
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:12,384
Maybe you like to fuck her like that
half-breed, would you like that?

472
00:58:12,553 --> 00:58:14,305
Let's finish what we came to do.

473
00:58:14,953 --> 00:58:16,432
You're right.

474
00:58:29,393 --> 00:58:31,190
Run.

475
00:58:32,873 --> 00:58:35,751
Run out there to die
or I'll kill you here?

476
00:58:38,513 --> 00:58:41,186
I didn't come out here 
to kill any woman.

477
01:00:11,153 --> 01:00:14,145
- Hey, what's that over there?
- That's a hell of a fire.

478
01:01:03,433 --> 01:01:04,991
It's one of McLennon's boys.

479
01:01:05,713 --> 01:01:08,227
Somebody shot him
in the back of the head.

480
01:01:08,393 --> 01:01:11,430
- How old you think this fire is?
- A couple hours at most. 

481
01:01:12,033 --> 01:01:15,230
Whoever did this, sergeant, can't be far.
Come on. Hyah! 

482
01:01:21,753 --> 01:01:23,152
Wait!

483
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:25,622
Wait, please! Stop!

484
01:02:10,513 --> 01:02:12,185
Hyah.

485
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:14,389
Hyah.

486
01:02:30,793 --> 01:02:32,226
Go on.

487
01:02:32,793 --> 01:02:34,749
Go on, come on.

488
01:02:56,393 --> 01:02:58,145
Go on.

489
01:03:49,673 --> 01:03:52,233
We'll leave the horses here,
follow up on foot.

490
01:05:00,753 --> 01:05:02,709
That bastard.

491
01:05:02,873 --> 01:05:04,192
That bastard.

492
01:05:25,553 --> 01:05:27,430
It goes to the end of the canyon.

493
01:05:27,593 --> 01:05:29,311
Well, that's good.

494
01:05:29,473 --> 01:05:33,386
That's the only way out.
Let's get there first.

495
01:05:50,953 --> 01:05:53,547
Ah. McLennon.

496
01:05:53,713 --> 01:05:56,625
Well, well, Lamont.

497
01:05:56,793 --> 01:05:59,353
What a pleasant surprise
to find you out here like this...

498
01:05:59,513 --> 01:06:02,710
in the middle of all this natural beauty.

499
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:06,471
Boys?

500
01:06:08,833 --> 01:06:12,303
What happened back there at the cabin?

501
01:06:14,633 --> 01:06:16,828
You found old Pete, huh?

502
01:06:18,633 --> 01:06:22,148
Goddamn half-breed,
he shot him right in the face.

503
01:06:22,313 --> 01:06:24,269
The half-breed shot him in the face?

504
01:06:24,433 --> 01:06:25,946
He, um...

505
01:06:26,113 --> 01:06:29,901
He ran out and old Pete went to grab him,
and bang, right in the face.

506
01:06:31,993 --> 01:06:33,631
Where's Sarah?

507
01:06:33,793 --> 01:06:35,192
Sarah, well...

508
01:06:35,353 --> 01:06:37,423
We're out looking for them now.

509
01:06:37,593 --> 01:06:41,506
McLennon, Nome is under martial law
right now.

510
01:06:41,673 --> 01:06:44,551
Martial law, is that right? 

511
01:06:44,713 --> 01:06:46,305
- Yup.
- Really?

512
01:06:46,473 --> 01:06:49,067
Ah. Well, well, well.

513
01:06:49,233 --> 01:06:51,793
Well, we'll be getting back there
as soon as we find them.

514
01:06:51,953 --> 01:06:53,909
Seeing as how you boys
will all be there...

515
01:06:54,073 --> 01:06:58,146
seeing that it's nice and safe
and martial and all.

516
01:06:59,513 --> 01:07:03,062
I'm sorry, McLennon,
but I'm taking over from here.

517
01:07:03,233 --> 01:07:05,986
And I'm ordering you and your men
to go back to Nome.

518
01:07:06,153 --> 01:07:09,748
You just tell us which direction
the half-breed went.

519
01:07:09,913 --> 01:07:12,666
- I'd rather not.
- No, I'm the law around here, McLennon.

520
01:07:12,833 --> 01:07:14,425
Not you.

521
01:07:14,593 --> 01:07:16,743
Yeah, Lamont.

522
01:07:16,913 --> 01:07:19,473
You're right. You are the law.

523
01:07:23,593 --> 01:07:26,426
The man is right, he is the law.

524
01:07:27,033 --> 01:07:29,183
- Look out!
- Hey, what the hell? 

525
01:07:47,113 --> 01:07:48,944
- Please.
- All right.

526
01:07:51,433 --> 01:07:53,469
Let's get to the dogs.

527
01:09:03,433 --> 01:09:05,503
What is it, Tonga?

528
01:09:09,513 --> 01:09:10,992
Very good.

529
01:09:11,993 --> 01:09:17,226
You can see things, track,
command dogs.

530
01:09:22,073 --> 01:09:24,189
Speak English.

531
01:09:25,993 --> 01:09:28,553
You understand what I say.

532
01:09:28,713 --> 01:09:30,988
You didn't need me here.

533
01:09:31,153 --> 01:09:34,623
You're a half-breed, just like him,
aren't you?

534
01:09:37,953 --> 01:09:39,989
Who was it, your mother?

535
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:45,551
Your father?

536
01:09:50,313 --> 01:09:52,622
I won't tell anyone.

537
01:10:11,073 --> 01:10:12,188
No, you won't.

538
01:10:30,233 --> 01:10:32,827
- Afraid of a wolf?
- No.

539
01:10:33,633 --> 01:10:35,908
But that half-breed's watching us.

540
01:10:41,713 --> 01:10:43,783
That half-breed killed him.

541
01:10:44,633 --> 01:10:49,149
- That's right, that half-breed killed him.
- Smiley, get the dogs ready.

542
01:10:49,313 --> 01:10:51,747
Smiley, get the dogs ready.

543
01:10:56,913 --> 01:10:58,824
You killed him, didn't you?

544
01:11:03,313 --> 01:11:06,146
I just said the half-breed killed him.

545
01:11:06,313 --> 01:11:08,827
- You saw him?
- Yeah, sure.

546
01:11:08,993 --> 01:11:11,985
Oh, something's funny in there, Sean.

547
01:11:12,153 --> 01:11:14,303
Where'd you think you were taking us?

548
01:11:15,753 --> 01:11:19,428
- What, are you starting to question me?
- It's time I go back.

549
01:11:21,873 --> 01:11:25,786
Half the mine is yours. 
You put your feet up for the rest of your life.

550
01:11:25,953 --> 01:11:27,909
Don't you think that's a little late?

551
01:11:28,073 --> 01:11:29,791
I'm going home.

552
01:11:30,793 --> 01:11:33,182
Don't ever touch me again.

553
01:11:39,273 --> 01:11:41,184
I'm coming apart.

554
01:11:43,753 --> 01:11:45,823
You can't leave without me, you know.

555
01:11:47,393 --> 01:11:49,588
You're the only friend I got.

556
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:52,550
You gotta trust me.

557
01:11:54,353 --> 01:11:55,866
We'll go.

558
01:14:52,753 --> 01:14:55,426
And in deciding this issue...

559
01:14:55,593 --> 01:14:59,381
the Miner's Association declares
all foreign claims void and illegal...

560
01:15:03,753 --> 01:15:08,702
and open to restaking by the citizens
of this frontier gem we call Nome.

561
01:15:08,873 --> 01:15:11,433
Americans. God's children.

562
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:19,262
And in so doing,
we rid ourselves of these scavengers...

563
01:15:20,673 --> 01:15:22,709
that have cost me so very much.

564
01:15:25,633 --> 01:15:27,146
The life...

565
01:15:28,713 --> 01:15:32,626
of a woman that I loved very deeply.

566
01:15:34,873 --> 01:15:36,226
Killed by a savage.

567
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:41,550
And the lives of my trusted friends...

568
01:15:41,713 --> 01:15:44,147
who bravely tried to help me save her.

569
01:15:55,433 --> 01:15:59,585
And here in Nome, your oasis...

570
01:16:00,953 --> 01:16:04,502
among you, right here,
there are savages.

571
01:16:04,673 --> 01:16:07,790
Some are red, some are harder to spot.

572
01:16:07,953 --> 01:16:11,628
But they all want the same thing,
and you know what that is, don't you?

573
01:16:13,313 --> 01:16:16,385
What do you have that they want?
And when will they try to take it?

574
01:16:17,113 --> 01:16:19,263
Maybe tonight.

575
01:16:19,433 --> 01:16:21,025
Maybe next week...

576
01:16:21,193 --> 01:16:23,753
maybe next month, but one night,
when you're sleeping...

577
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:26,473
they'll come take what's yours,
because you're alone.

578
01:16:27,513 --> 01:16:30,311
But from this day forward,
you are not alone.

579
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:33,062
We are not alone.

580
01:16:38,193 --> 01:16:40,104
Macbeth said:

581
01:16:40,713 --> 01:16:42,066
"When our actions do not...

582
01:16:43,233 --> 01:16:47,021
our fears, we will fight against..."

583
01:16:48,553 --> 01:16:50,783
- What?
- Sean McLennon.

584
01:16:50,953 --> 01:16:53,831
You're under arrest
for the murder of Sheriff Lamont...

585
01:16:53,993 --> 01:16:56,029
Deputies Ross and Graves...

586
01:16:56,193 --> 01:16:58,582
and three soldiers
of the United States Army.

587
01:16:59,433 --> 01:17:02,743
- What are you talking about?
- We have an eyewitness.

588
01:17:11,913 --> 01:17:14,632
The Indians saved her life
and brought her here.

589
01:17:14,793 --> 01:17:16,749
Take him away.

590
01:17:32,393 --> 01:17:33,746
Citizens of Nome.

591
01:17:35,113 --> 01:17:37,149
Citizens of Nome.

592
01:17:41,273 --> 01:17:42,308
People of Nome.

593
01:17:42,473 --> 01:17:46,307
I'm also here to inform you
that meetings such as these...

594
01:17:46,473 --> 01:17:48,509
with obvious intent to cause disorder...

595
01:17:48,673 --> 01:17:50,789
It's all over.

596
01:17:51,353 --> 01:17:54,231
- Thank you.
- Get yourself some rest.

597
01:17:55,473 --> 01:18:01,105
Congress has declared that all claims,
past, present and future...

598
01:18:01,273 --> 01:18:05,664
by all miners, American and foreign,
will be honored.

599
01:18:20,713 --> 01:18:23,432
- Can I have my own room now?
- Of course you can.

600
01:18:23,593 --> 01:18:26,312
You can have anything you want.

601
01:18:26,953 --> 01:18:30,912
- Where is McLennon?
- He's in jail.

602
01:19:09,073 --> 01:19:10,745
I wanted to say goodbye.

603
01:19:15,113 --> 01:19:17,343
So did I.

604
01:19:36,593 --> 01:19:38,311
- What's going on here?
- Haven't you heard?

605
01:19:38,473 --> 01:19:41,670
The whole bloody beach
is covered with gold.

606
01:20:36,873 --> 01:20:41,025
<i>My ancestors taught me
you cannot own the land...</i>

607
01:20:41,193 --> 01:20:43,707
<i>you can only respect it.</i>

608
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:46,789
<i>This is what I fought for.</i>

609
01:20:47,393 --> 01:20:50,271
<i>And what I will always believe.</i>
