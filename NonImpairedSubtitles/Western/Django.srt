1
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:49,200
We whip wild animals
when they try to rebel.

2
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,500
That way you'll learn
not to escape again.

3
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,700
Hold this.

4
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,100
You know what this cross means,
don't you? Huh? You Mexican bitch!

5
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,500
The fire will clean away your sins!

6
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,500
Hey, you!
What cemetery do you come from?

7
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,000
lf you came here to bury
these scoundrels...

8
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,900
...hurry up, and get it done quietly.

9
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,300
l'd rather talk.

10
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,900
From the way you're talking,
it looks like you're in a damn hurry...

11
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,300
...to end up in the casket
you're dragging behind you.

12
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Maybe.

13
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,600
Are you from the North?

14
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,900
l fought for the North.

15
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,600
We don't like those who fought
for the North. This is the South.

16
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,600
l can see that, my brother. l know.

17
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,100
Enough! Forget about this gravedigger.

18
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,500
Let's take care of the woman now.

19
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,700
Taking it out on women
doesn't look good.

20
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,500
What did you say?

21
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,300
lt doesn't matter.

22
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,000
What matters is that
you're about to die.

23
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,800
My name is Django.

24
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,200
As long as you stay with me,
nobody will harm you.

25
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
You wouldn't make it very far.

26
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,900
Besides, it's not yet time
to cross that bridge.

27
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,400
For now, my path goes in
the opposite direction.

28
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,100
What's your name?

29
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,300
Maria.

30
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,700
Let's go to the town.

31
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,200
Get me a bed for the girl.

32
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,100
Anything for you, stranger.
But the girl...

33
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,300
No, she can't stay here.

34
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,600
And there are no more rooms,
they are all taken.

35
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Go and see for yourself.

36
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,000
The key to your room.
Give it to me, come on.

37
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,600
Don't worry.
l'll pay for the inconvenience.

38
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,700
l hope that's enough.

39
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,900
Oh, well, thank you!
Look at this!

40
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,200
Go to sleep. You've had
quite an eventful day.

41
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,100
The room is upstairs,
at the end of the hall.

42
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,000
Tomorrow morning
the girl has to leave.

43
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,800
No later than tomorrow morning,
l'm sorry. Understood?

44
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,800
There's no need to hurry my friend.

45
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,500
Bring me something to eat.

46
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,400
Here.

47
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,800
lf you work in the casket business,
you chose well.

48
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,000
There is a lot of work around here.

49
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,600
So far, l've met only a few customers.

50
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:56,800
The damn war between the Mexicans
and Major Jackson's soldiers...

51
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,400
...reduced the town to this,
as you can see.

52
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,600
A dead town.

53
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,100
And your women?
Do they sleep with the ghosts?

54
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:13,700
We manage, a bit with the Mexicans,
and a bit with the Major's men.

55
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,000
We want to be at peace
with everybody.

56
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,300
Without being unfair, right?

57
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,300
Well, there is kind of an agreement...
This is a neutral place...

58
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,800
We try very hard to stay alive.

59
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,500
You are new to this place,
young man...

60
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,400
You don't know Major Jackson...

61
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,700
You don't know him, do you?

62
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,200
Stop trying to figure out who l know,
old man.

63
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,900
Don't you want to offer me a drink?

64
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,600
You know, it takes guts to
travel with that girl.

65
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,800
lt means having to face both
the racists and the Mexicans.

66
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,300
l like having to face people.

67
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,800
Oh, really? Well, so much the better.

68
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:25,500
You know, my colleagues are
afraid of the casket.

69
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,400
lt doesn't scare me.
lt's just like any other job.

70
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,300
ls someone in there?

71
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Someone by the name of Django.

72
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,500
Good day, brother Jonathan.

73
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:12,200
This is all l was able to scrape together
for this month's share.

74
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Business isn't going well.

75
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,000
ln that case it'll be better
if you talk about this to the Major.

76
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
l'm getting a dress to change into.

77
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,800
You know, the Major's men
should be here soon.

78
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,900
Maybe he'll come here himself.

79
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,900
The Major doesn't like the color green.
He goes crazy for red.

80
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
Here.

81
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,400
l'll change here.
l'm used to my mirror.

82
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,500
Don't be down. Maybe, if you are nice
to the Major, you can save yourself.

83
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,500
Why don't you dress yourself in red?
Of course, listen to me.

84
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,600
Dress in red, and you'll be safe.

85
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,100
The Major isn't after you.
lt's the Mexicans he can't stand.

86
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,000
He says it's their skin color
that bothers him.

87
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,500
Well, you're really asking for it.
You could have stayed with us.

88
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,000
You wanted to run away and...

89
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,500
...ended up in the hands of Jackson's
worst enemies, the Mexicans.

90
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,700
Why did you run away from them
as well? But, what do you want?

91
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,700
l don't know.

92
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,800
What do you mean, you don't know?
Listen, are you trying to pull my leg?

93
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,200
They'll get rid of your man for sure.

94
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,200
Too bad, he's such
a good-looking fellow.

95
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,900
A deck of cards, please.

96
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,800
He wants a deck of cards.

97
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,600
You like to play with the dead guy,
don't you?

98
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,800
lf you listen to me,
you'll be able to save yourself.

99
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,300
Make yourself as beautiful as possible.

100
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,500
No, thank you. lt wouldn't help.

101
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:03,600
Damn, that's Jackson having fun.

102
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:09,700
Some Mexican must have refused
to pay. And so, they let him run...

103
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,500
Terrible!

104
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Go ahead!

105
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,700
Another one.

106
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,300
l'm bored now. You take care of it.

107
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,500
An interesting guy has arrived in town.

108
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,200
They'll be coming here,
and they'll want to have fun.

109
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,900
Come. Lock yourself in,
and don't move.

110
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,100
Major Jackson and his men are coming.
Run, go upstairs.

111
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,600
Good day, Mr. Jackson.

112
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,900
Welcome! Make yourself at home.

113
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,900
Come with me.

114
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,700
Unfortunately, it's not all of it, but,
as soon as l am able to...

115
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,100
l believe you, Nathaniel, l believe you.

116
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,200
A coward never lies,
l know that very well...

117
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,000
...especially when they pay
for their protection.

118
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,200
You'll pay me your share at the fort
when we get there in a week.

119
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,000
ln a week? As you wish.
Thank you, Major, thank you.

120
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,700
Hey, you, come upstairs with me.

121
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,500
l don't want to.

122
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Come on, let's go.

123
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,500
l don't want to. You can't buy me.

124
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,600
lf you don't want to go with him,
you come with me.

125
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,300
She told you she doesn't want to go.

126
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,100
Let her go.

127
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
Stop it!

128
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,300
Send away all the girls, Nathaniel.

129
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,800
Let's go girls, go upstairs. You, too.

130
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Man, not again.

131
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,900
A man must be very brave
to talk this way to Ringo.

132
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,100
Brave, or crazy.

133
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,300
Just like the dirty Yankee, who killed
five of my men down at the river.

134
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,400
That must have been some man.

135
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,200
Five men at one time?
That's a job done only by specialists.

136
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,200
The man also took a woman with him.

137
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,200
A harlot who was sold to the Mexicans.

138
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,700
One who betrayed our race.

139
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:31,400
The war is over, and these things
aren't that way anymore.

140
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:37,700
l am sorry to contradict you,
but my war never ends, my friend.

141
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,600
You're smart to drag a casket
behind you.

142
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,700
That way you'll be treated with respect.
You'll be buried.

143
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,400
Usually we put the Northern scoundrels
out as poison for the vultures.

144
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:54,300
l wasn't aware that this racial matter
would also involve the poor vultures.

145
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,900
l thought it concerned
only the Southern pigs.

146
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,900
Men, let's proceed.

147
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,700
We've done enough talking for today.

148
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,600
There is one more bullet.

149
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,500
But, that would be too easy.

150
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,800
How many more men do you have...

151
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,800
...pig?

152
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,300
l asked, how many more men?

153
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,300
Forty.

154
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:50,100
Good, you pig. Next time let
all forty of them come with you.

155
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,700
lt will be more fun.

156
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,000
l'll be here waiting for you.

157
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,900
Rest assured. We'll return.

158
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,600
You can put things back in order.
But don't use my casket.

159
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,100
l am taking a blanket.

160
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
Thank you.

161
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
For what?

162
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,400
For what you have done for me.

163
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,400
l didn't do it for you.

164
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,600
Well, then, thank you even if
you didn't do it for me.

165
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,400
You thank too much. Who knows if
it was a good thing that l saved you?

166
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,100
l thank you because, even if
it was just for a few moments...

167
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,300
...you made me feel what it was like
to have a man at my side...

168
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,900
...who would protect me...

169
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,800
...who would love me.

170
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,200
Then we have to make sure that
the illusion is complete.

171
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Brief, but complete.

172
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,200
Why did you let Major Jackson go?

173
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,200
He'll return with his 40 men
and he will kill us all.

174
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,000
Unfortunately, l know him too well.

175
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,300
What are you afraid of, old man?
You pay to be protected by him.

176
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,900
l pay so that l won't be killed like
those he deems inferior...

177
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
...because of their darker skins.

178
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,900
The sun, too, darkens the skin.

179
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Yes, but Jackson and his men
don't want to admit that.

180
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,600
They have something like a religion.

181
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,600
Did you see the red caps they wear?
They are fanatics!

182
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,900
Sometimes, it's necessary to eliminate
the fanatics, the crazy ones...

183
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,000
...for the common good.

184
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,900
l know, but you can't do it alone.

185
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,900
l am not alone.

186
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,300
Leave. Take the girl with you
and go far away.

187
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,800
You worry too much, old man.
lt could ruin your health.

188
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,700
Quickly, before Jackson arrives.

189
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:17,000
Go! You could try to get to the swamp
and escape to the other side of it.

190
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,500
lt's better if you go back inside.
My plans have not changed.

191
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,500
lf he finds you here, he'll blame us, too!
He'll kill us.

192
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,200
There is nothing to be afraid of,
old man. l told you...

193
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,400
l am not alone.

194
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:17,000
Nathaniel, if you'd go to the Mexicans,
maybe those two would be saved.

195
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:21,200
Great, but l wouldn't make it there alive
nor would l make it to the cemetery.

196
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:31,100
With all those hooded men gathering
there in town, l have to be honest...

197
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:35,800
...l am sorry, but l am forced to hope
they'll do him in right away.

198
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,100
He'll suffer less, and l will lose
less customers.

199
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,100
Mother of God!

200
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,600
lt's over, old man. You won't have to
pay anymore to stay alive.

201
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,600
Did you kill them all?

202
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,800
Almost all of them.

203
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,200
Don't worry. You'll still have
the Mexicans as your customers.

204
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,500
Get rid of those dead guys now.

205
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,900
Hmm, and where can l put them?
We'll have to open another cemetery.

206
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,100
Cemeteries are a good investment
in this area...

207
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,400
...if you can get paid in advance.

208
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,300
And Major Jackson?
ls he dead as well?

209
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,400
No, l let him go.

210
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,300
Why?

211
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,400
Because it wasn't his time yet.
l need him alive for now.

212
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,800
lf they had only told me that l would
end up as a gravedigger...

213
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,700
...and that without any pay.

214
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,400
Well, it's better being above
the ground than under it.

215
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,400
Was this someone you knew?

216
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,800
Someone who was a part of my life.

217
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,500
Probably the only one
that really mattered.

218
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,100
Did Jackson's men kill her?

219
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,700
They killed her.

220
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,600
And where were you at the time?

221
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,900
Far away...

222
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,300
...way too far away, old man.

223
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,300
This damn woman is sin made flesh.

224
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,400
lt's her who caused that pool of blood
in the town.

225
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,500
Yes, that's true.
Because of you we'll have to leave.

226
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,800
Men won't come to this town anymore.
We'll starve to death!

227
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,900
Don't be silly! Maria has nothing to do
with what happened. lt's all nonsense!

228
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,400
No, it's the truth!
Smash her, destroy her...

229
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,200
...if you don't want that creep
to hurt you again.

230
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,800
Leave her alone!
What has she done to you?

231
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,700
Why are you tormenting her?

232
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,100
Screw off, you bitch!

233
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,700
Don't be stupid!
She's the responsible one!

234
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,200
You slut!

235
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,300
l'll show you!

236
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,300
The Mexicans are coming!

237
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,300
You tried to run, didn't you?
But, you didn't make it in time, huh?

238
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,300
You are Jackson's damn spy!

239
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,600
You tell them what you see
and what you hear...

240
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,700
...because you have big ears.

241
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,900
We know what to do with big ears.

242
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,000
Right, muchachos?

243
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,600
No, no!

244
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,200
Amigo!

245
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,600
Hey, Yankee!

246
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,600
l thought there were no more bastards
left in the town.

247
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,600
Are you Hugo's men?

248
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,900
Wait!

249
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:12,200
lt's better to take them to the General.
He might want them alive.

250
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,000
Maria, escaping from us was
a dangerous thing to do.

251
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,500
l could punish you for what you did.

252
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,700
What would you say if l cut off
one of your beautiful ears?

253
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,800
You had no right to keep me prisoner!

254
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,400
l had the right that every man has with
all the women he likes!

255
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:37,400
You know, Hugo, you're talking just like
one of Jackson's racists.

256
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
You tart!

257
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,400
Listen Maria,
l don't take this from anyone.

258
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,000
Don't forget that you are half lncan
and half Mexican.

259
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,100
Don't let me remember
the one half l hate.

260
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,300
Look who's here.

261
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,400
The most clever Gringo
of the entire frontier.

262
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:08,300
Hombre! lt has been so long since
l last saw your dirty face!

263
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,000
This is Django.

264
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,900
A deserter, thief, loner,
and more than a friend!

265
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,000
Now we are even.

266
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,200
Calm down, Ricardo!

267
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,700
l owe Django a lot!

268
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,700
Just for having saved your life once
in prison. And also for the woman.

269
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,100
l brought her back to you, Hugo.

270
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,700
She is in good condition.
Take her back.

271
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,400
She is not my woman.
She is just one woman.

272
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,400
l'm thirsty. We have to
celebrate our meeting!

273
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:52,300
To your health, Django!
To the death of Jackson's pigs!

274
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,100
Long live the revolution!

275
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,800
To your death, Jackson!

276
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,800
Those pigs aren't here anymore.
He killed them all.

277
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,400
You were able to kill
all those bastards yourself?

278
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,600
That's impossible!
How did you do that, Django?

279
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,000
lt wasn't very difficult.

280
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,800
lf you had been in my place,
you would have done the same.

281
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,800
Of course.

282
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:27,200
But my men are tired.
They would all want to go home.

283
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:31,500
But in Mexico the government
is waiting for us.

284
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,800
And we don't have enough weapons
to fight against them.

285
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,500
Of course.

286
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,500
But l could help you, Hugo.

287
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,000
How?

288
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:09,600
Look at that!

289
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,700
Oh, Mother of God!

290
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,200
This toy is worth 150 guns.

291
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,100
That's the way l exterminated
the Major's men.

292
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,600
What type of weapon is this?

293
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,400
Get out of the way, men.
You could get hurt.

294
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,400
No! Don't do it, Django! l beg you!

295
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,500
These are the kind of weapons
l would need!

296
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,800
With ten of these it would be easy
to go back to Mexico. Right, Hugo?

297
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,100
Where are the other nine?

298
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,600
They are in Pecos waiting
to be bought.

299
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,000
l know the man who sells them.

300
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:16,800
Thank you for the information, Django.
But our revolution is a poor one.

301
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,100
lf you are poor, you have to
try to become rich.

302
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,900
That's the only way you can win.

303
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,900
Did you come here to pull my leg?

304
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:30,700
No, l came here to help you
and to get help.

305
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,200
Well, explain yourself!

306
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,600
At the fort there is gold for you
and for me.

307
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,300
The fort is very far from the border.

308
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,300
l can't return to Mexico...

309
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:55,900
...at least not until l have
the 10 machineguns.

310
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:01,200
Plus, those brutes of the government
have far more men than us.

311
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,200
Every Saturday Nathaniel takes his
carriage with women over the border...

312
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:09,900
...and he visits the men at the fort.

313
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,200
lsn't that true, old man?

314
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,500
Yeah, yeah.

315
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,200
Explain yourself better, Django.

316
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:25,600
This week Jackson will go to the fort
as well, to set his foot in Mexico.

317
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,000
That's why l kept him alive.

318
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,600
l want the gold more than
l want his death.

319
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,900
And that gold will be ours!
Understood?

320
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,200
Understood!

321
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,800
But how?

322
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,900
lt will be difficult, that's for sure.

323
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,800
But with the help of my toy
it will also be fun.

324
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,800
The women have arrived!

325
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,500
Finally, they have arrived!
lt's about time!

326
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,500
The women are here! The women!

327
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,400
Let's go, women!

328
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,900
Come on, step down!
Let them step out.

329
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,000
There they are, great!

330
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,500
Let's go! Over there!

331
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,000
Pigs!

332
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,000
Cowards!

333
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Let's go!

334
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,800
Come on! Charge!

335
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,600
Let's go, Ricardo!

336
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,800
Horses, let's go!

337
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,300
The machinegun is stuck!

338
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,500
Come on, horses!

339
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,400
No, oh no!

340
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,800
When we get to the border,
we'll get to the other side!

341
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,700
Well, let's go then!

342
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,900
Come on. Why don't you
go after them?

343
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,000
We have to stop. Otherwise,
we'll enter American territory.

344
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:29,300
Hooray! General Hugo has arrived!

345
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:51,400
Men! We are back! lt was a great trip!

346
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:57,100
Django's strike was
a complete success!

347
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,600
With the gold we'll buy the weapons!

348
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,300
We'll go back to Mexico.

349
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,100
We'll win the revolution!

350
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,300
We will win the revolution!

351
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,800
You see Hugo, we made it.

352
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,400
Oh, yes!

353
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:18,300
All that's left is to divide the gold
and say goodbye.

354
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,600
Give me my share.

355
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:25,300
Just like that? Do you really
want to leave just now?

356
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:33,400
Well, l have nothing more to do
in this town.

357
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,400
What do you mean, "nothing more,"
my brother?

358
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,700
Together we'll make
great things happen!

359
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,700
l'll make you lieutenant
of my revolution!

360
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:49,400
You already have many lieutenants,
and l only want what's due me.

361
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,400
Are you kidding?

362
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,600
You'll get double, double,
you understand?

363
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,500
Once l am in power.

364
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:06,900
Hugo...

365
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,700
l want my gold.

366
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:16,600
Oh man, you're obsessed.
Nobody will take your gold.

367
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,800
Don't you trust me?

368
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,900
He doesn't trust me.

369
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:30,200
You know, we'll keep your gold
in a safe place.

370
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,400
Let me show you where.

371
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,900
There we are. Even if it's just one door,
there are many guards.

372
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:52,600
The gold for our revolution
will be well guarded.

373
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,300
No one will be able to take it away.

374
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:23,500
lt's a pile of gold,
but in the form of powder.

375
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,600
Take this. Drink.

376
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:49,800
No.

377
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,900
What's the matter, tart?

378
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,500
Are you in a bad mood because
the American doesn't care about you?

379
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,700
Come on, let me comfort you!

380
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,800
Damn you!

381
00:56:58,900 --> 00:56:59,900
Ricardo!

382
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,300
Leave Maria alone.

383
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,900
And you would give her to that bastard
American! lt's better if l take her!

384
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,900
l decide who will take her!

385
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:33,900
You bastard!

386
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:18,200
Thank you, Django. You saved my life
once more. l won't forget it.

387
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,900
Look at Maria. Look at her.

388
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,500
She can't take her eyes off you.

389
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,600
Take her! My gift to you.

390
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,800
You spend a wonderful night.

391
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,800
Thanks. But she's not my type.

392
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,800
l prefer her.

393
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:50,300
You see, Maria?
The Gringo prefers the dark one!

394
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:58,300
Don't be hurt. Come and drink with us!
This is a great night!

395
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:03,300
Come on, muchachos!
Tequila for everyone!

396
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,200
Get undressed.

397
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Go on, undress yourself.

398
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,700
Don't pay attention to what l'm doing.

399
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,500
Look!

400
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,200
- My goodness!
- Yeah!

401
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:12,700
Look!

402
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,400
lsn't she beautiful?

403
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,600
Just a minute!

404
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,900
Look! The horses are fleeing!

405
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:30,900
You have to take me with you, Django!

406
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,500
All right, as you wish.

407
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,500
Hurry up, Django, hurry!

408
01:08:58,700 --> 01:08:59,500
Watch out!

409
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:20,600
Prepare the men, Miguel.
Let's go hunting!

410
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,700
Take the carriage. Go through the
valley, and you'll get to the pass.

411
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,900
You'll be safe there.

412
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:44,800
And you?

413
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,100
lt's time for me to cross that bridge.

414
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:55,100
l waited a life, an entire life,
waiting to bury Django in this casket.

415
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:59,100
The gold will help me
make it disappear forever.

416
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:02,300
Let go of that gold, Django!
What do you care about it?

417
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:09,100
We'll start a new life together.
l'll help you forget.

418
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,100
l love you, Django.

419
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:21,400
l left love behind many years ago.

420
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:25,400
Now it rests under a cross
in the cemetery in Tombstone.

421
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:30,500
lf l bring you with me, you'd risk
ending up the same way.

422
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:35,700
And, maybe you wouldn't
make me forget.

423
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:02,400
Django!

424
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,600
Oh, Django!

425
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:02,300
Now that we meet again, Django...

426
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:05,400
Where is the gold?

427
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,600
The mud swallowed it.

428
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:18,800
A horse stumbles, a casket slips...

429
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:21,100
lt's fate, General.

430
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:32,300
lt certainly won't be the lost gold,
amigo, that will change my fate.

431
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:38,200
We'll go back to Mexico anyway, right?
The decision has already been made.

432
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,700
Now we are even, Django.

433
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:46,300
You saved my life two times, and
l did the same, back then and now.

434
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:52,000
l won't kill you. We don't kill thieves,
not even when they betray a friend.

435
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:57,400
We punish thieves in a different way.
Right, Miguel?

436
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:08,600
This is for our revolution!
And this is for the gold you stole!

437
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:09,600
Damn you!

438
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,400
You damned scoundrel! Thief!

439
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,700
You disgusting coward!

440
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:36,900
lt's your turn, men.

441
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,100
No matter how good a gunman is,
he still needs his hands, right, Django!

442
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:04,000
Pray that Jackson doesn't find you.
lt would be embarrassing for you.

443
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:08,800
Goodbye now, Django. My men and l
will go back to Mexico...

444
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:13,000
...to win or to die. Let's go, fellows!

445
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:19,400
Bye, bye, Django!
We'll meet again in hell!

446
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:21,500
Let's go!

447
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:43,700
You madman!

448
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,900
Help her, Nathaniel.

449
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:55,700
l believe she can still be saved.

450
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:02,600
Alright. l will do my best.
But you should leave, don't stay here.

451
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:05,100
Jackson will come back here
any moment.

452
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:11,100
Django, leave! Save yourself,
run away before it's too late.

453
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:13,100
Don't worry about me.

454
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:18,600
There is one more thing l have to do.
l have to kill Jackson.

455
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:24,000
That's the only way for this town
and me to have a life again.

456
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,200
lt's no good to keep running away.

457
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:34,100
You have to stop and
fight to the very end.

458
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,600
l understood that when l was
squeezing your hand tightly...

459
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:41,600
...while the casket was going down
in the savannah.

460
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:45,900
lf l should fail, then at least l tried...

461
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,100
...to get my life back.

462
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:55,300
Django, your... your hands.

463
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:59,500
My hands will still be able to serve me.

464
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:07,400
Nathaniel, hide Maria, and tell Jackson
that l'll wait for him...

465
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:11,100
...at the crosses of the
Tombstone cemetery...

466
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:16,600
...because his time has come.

467
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:03,300
Django is waiting for you at the crosses
of the Tombstone cemetery.

468
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:07,800
But there is nothing for you to fear.
They broke his hands.

469
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:34,700
You thought you had won,
right, Django?

470
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:38,800
lnstead, here l am, to fight my war...

471
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,600
