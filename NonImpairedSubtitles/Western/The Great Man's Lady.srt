1
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,591
<i>Every day for 35 years
she's been
sitting down there</i>

2
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,962
in that
infernal rocking chair
right under my nose.

3
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:50,491
Hannah Hoyt, Hannah Sempler,
whatever her right name is.

4
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:54,899
Rocking and smiling
and keeping the truth about
Ethan Hoyt all to herself.

5
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:58,375
And now,
today of all days,
Ethan Hoyt Day.

6
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:01,678
The day they are
dedicating his statue
in the city square.

7
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,739
She has to hide inside
the house somewhere

8
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,546
<i>and pretend she doesn't know
it's any different
from 10,000 other days.</i>

9
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:11,821
What is it?

10
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,655
Eastern reporters, huh?
On the square, huh?

11
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,560
Call off
my bloodhounds.

12
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,722
<i>Who's watching
the back of the house?</i>

13
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:19,822
Burns.

14
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,367
Tell him to hop over
to the square.

15
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:25,495
<i>Eastern reporters, hmm?
They're up to something.</i>

16
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,535
Hello?

17
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:31,801
Yes.

18
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,536
No.

19
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,013
No. Not a sign of life.

20
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,175
You bet.
Yeah, right away.

21
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:41,611
<i>Who's watching
the front of the house?</i>

22
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:42,712
Pierce.

23
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,121
Tell him not to let
those Eastern reporters
out of his sight.

24
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,125
<i>I bet the old lady's
going to talk.</i>

25
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,323
Hello?

26
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,466
Depth bomb.

27
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,100
Yeah, this is Pierce.

28
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,297
<i>Yeah, I've been
watching all morning.</i>

29
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,604
No, just a few
glasses of beer.

30
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,908
<i>I'm practically there.</i>

31
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,350
All clear.

32
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,559
And so, my friends,
it is only fitting and proper

33
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,896
that we celebrate
the anniversary

34
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,028
of the birth
of a great American.

35
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,903
A man who founded
this great city of ours.

36
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,602
<i>Who served unselfishly
in our country's
halls of Congress.</i>

37
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,841
A man who died here

38
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:45,050
with the shining armor
of his ideals untarnished.

39
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,348
<i>That's Froman of the AP
over there near Forbes.</i>

40
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,992
<i>That's Paula Wales
from Washington.</i>

41
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,389
<i>The other guy's Quentin
of The New York Times.</i>

42
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,690
united in peace...

43
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,293
<i>You know, they're
not here for buttons.</i>

44
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,997
<i>The chief was right.
I'll bet she's gonna talk.</i>

45
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:11,472
to a man
who devoted the last 30 years
of his colorful life

46
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:15,976
to an unselfish fight
for the weak
against the powerful.

47
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:20,182
Even at the expense
of his own personal fortune.

48
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,946
My friends,
I give you a great man,

49
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,752
a great American,

50
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,729
Senator Ethan Hoyt.

51
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,354
<i>Hannah Sempler's.</i>

52
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:57,946
<i>Miss Sempler's, please.</i>

53
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,821
<i>The Sempler woman's home.</i>

54
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,554
<i>Miss Hannah Sempler's house.</i>

55
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,562
Follow them.

56
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,324
Hey, wait for me.

57
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,261
This is my cab.

58
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,634
Be a sport,
share it.

59
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,933
Where are you going?

60
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,166
<i>Miss Hannah Sempler's.</i>

61
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,766
<i>Shake. The whole world's
going there.</i>

62
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,251
All right, Forbes.
Bring up the artillery.

63
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,623
<i>Well, that's one way.</i>

64
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,321
<i>I say, old boy,
that's a little unsporting.</i>

65
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,556
If you want a story,
you get it.

66
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,689
<i>She's not just news
anymore, she's history.</i>

67
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,202
<i>Tell the old lady
she's got guests.
Impatient guests.</i>

68
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,743
Oh, the old boy himself.

69
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,396
To what do I owe
this peculiar honor
may I ask?

70
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,296
<i>That's fine.
Hold it, Mrs. Hoyt.</i>

71
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,136
My name is
Hannah Sempler.

72
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,644
May I ask
why you intrude here?

73
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,243
Well?

74
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,555
<i>Miss Sempler,
I'd like to apologize
for all of us</i>

75
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,421
for our rudeness
in breaking in
like this.

76
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:42,655
Very well, you may go.

77
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,526
The fact is, Miss Sempler,
forget our rudeness.

78
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,566
<i>It's the public
who's broken in.</i>

79
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,533
The public who has
the right to know.

80
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,593
<i>The public, in who's eyes
Ethan Hoyt has grown</i>

81
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,639
to the size
of a national hero.

82
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:57,198
The public, sir?
You are the public?

83
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,641
Miss Sempler,
you misunderstand.

84
00:07:58,711 --> 00:07:59,973
We come here
humbly as it were,

85
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,809
seeking the answer
to a great human enigma.

86
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:02,870
A matter of history.

87
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:03,973
Were you married
to Ethan Hoyt?

88
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,108
Why did he die
in your home?

89
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,173
Was his real wife there?

90
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,549
You and he had any children?
Where are they?

91
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,554
Your claims, if true,
would make him a bigamist.

92
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,557
We ask you
to prove these claims
in the public interest.

93
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,786
The public, sir?

94
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,126
<i>You aren't the public.</i>

95
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,161
The public is made up of
millions of private homes
like mine.

96
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,298
In our homes,
we draw inspiration

97
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,701
from the memory
of our great men.

98
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,801
Like Senator Hoyt.

99
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,639
You seek to destroy
that memory.

100
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,902
You break in here
with cameras
and threats...

101
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,243
If that thing
goes off again...

102
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,914
You seek nothing
but scandal.

103
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,352
<i>You'll find none here.</i>

104
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,682
I bid you good day.

105
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:49,091
<i>She can't prove a thing.
Because her story is nothing
but a pack of lies.</i>

106
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,561
<i>She's just an old windbag
trying to crash the limelight.</i>

107
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,031
Stop it! Stop it.
Leave her alone.

108
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,560
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

109
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:58,968
Whether her story
is true or not,

110
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,404
what right have you got
to persecute her like this?

111
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:06,207
<i>Can't you see
she's helpless
and all alone?</i>

112
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,611
<i>She's a very old lady.</i>

113
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,426
<i>Yes, it's true.
I am old. Very old.</i>

114
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,795
<i>But I've made no claims,
I've told no lies.</i>

115
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,302
Whatever I know is a matter
of my own private history.

116
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:35,605
I am content to remain silent
the rest of
my few days on Earth.

117
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:38,875
That is all.

118
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,188
Well, you came
with the rest of them.

119
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,065
What are you
waiting for?

120
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,898
Because...
Because I...

121
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,405
Yes, I know.
Got a public, too?

122
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,968
Not yet.

123
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,509
<i>Of course not.
You're just a child.</i>

124
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,977
<i>But I will have.
I'm a biographer.</i>

125
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:15,838
A what?

126
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,440
<i>I'm writing on the life
of Senator Ethan Hoyt.</i>

127
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,575
Ah!

128
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,950
Nice job.

129
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,421
You like your work?

130
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,982
I think
he was one of the most...
Well, the most wonderful...

131
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,322
So do I.

132
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,524
Guess I ought to
know about that.

133
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,227
Then you have to help me.
Please, Miss Sempler.

134
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,829
<i>I've spent three years
writing my book.
All the money I could raise.</i>

135
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,669
<i>I've got to know
what part you played,
were you married to him...</i>

136
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,334
All sorts of things.

137
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,241
My book is worthless
without your help.

138
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,247
<i>That's why
I had to see you.</i>

139
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,715
Look away, girl.
Look all you like.

140
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,578
<i>There's nothing much to see.</i>

141
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,386
Just a hundred years
of memories.

142
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,620
Some good, some bad.

143
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:03,320
I ought to have been
buried years ago.

144
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,391
But you know, I...

145
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,499
<i>I can't really say that.</i>

146
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:11,195
<i>I'd like to live
to be 200 years old.</i>

147
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,040
<i>Then you and I'd
both be old ladies</i>

148
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,169
and we could
compare notes.

149
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:23,108
That is, if you had
any to compare.

150
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,045
Now, you run along
and leave me alone.

151
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,988
<i>You come back
in a hundred years
and I'll talk to you.</i>

152
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,185
You go along now.

153
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:57,674
Hmm.

154
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,319
One of the meanest things
about growing old.

155
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:09,260
You forget how important
everything seems
to young people.

156
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,127
Hey, girl.

157
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,638
Scat. Go on.

158
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,474
<i>I'm all right.
I'll go now.</i>

159
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,009
Nothing of the sort.

160
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,672
Listen, I have something
very special upstairs.

161
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,246
Twenty-year-old stuff.

162
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,807
Now, come on.

163
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,882
<i>We'll have our own drink
to Senator Hoyt.</i>

164
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,223
Over here.
Now you give me a hand.

165
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,052
<i>That's a girl.</i>

166
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,731
<i>I'm as wiry
as the devil,
mind you,</i>

167
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,268
but a climb
gets me down.

168
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,163
<i>That's a girl.</i>

169
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,972
You know, girl,

170
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,017
you need more gumption
and spirit.

171
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,782
<i>Yes, that's what
you need.</i>

172
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:12,681
Oh!

173
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,994
<i>Where'd you say
you learned about
Ethan Hoyt?</i>

174
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,657
Books.

175
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:26,435
<i>You'll never learn
a man out of books.</i>

176
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,267
Or a woman either.

177
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,205
Books.

178
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,216
Psst.

179
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,485
Ah, yes, girl.
Men were different
in those days.

180
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,919
Men like Ethan.

181
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,794
A drink in one hand,

182
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,964
and luck in the other.

183
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,564
Open the door, girl.

184
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,737
There was a band
playing in his heart

185
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,446
and the devil
in his eyes.

186
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,348
And I...

187
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:21,354
I was a very young lady
in a stuffy
Philadelphia house.

188
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:27,527
In the year 1848.

189
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,397
Well, I must say.

190
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:34,489
<i>What's the matter?</i>

191
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,034
Making a public spectacle
of yourself.

192
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,091
Mama says...

193
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,331
<i>Oh, don't be stuffy.
Did you see
how he smiled?</i>

194
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,271
A gentleman
would never
have dared.

195
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,365
You mean, like
my Mr. Cadwallader?

196
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,431
Mama says...

197
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,603
<i>Because I dare say
he's never smiled
in his whole life.</i>

198
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,807
But I almost died laughing
when he proposed to me.

199
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,179
<i>"Miss Sempler, I...</i>

200
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,783
<i>"I have the great honor
to address myself
to your favor.</i>

201
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,343
<i>"I am quite willing
to overlook the fact</i>

202
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,821
<i>"that you have grown up
without a mother</i>

203
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,051
<i>"to instruct you
in the duties
of a proper wife.</i>

204
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,185
<i>"But your father and I
are thoroughly agreed
that..."</i>

205
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,230
<i>That's not right
and proper.
What's not?</i>

206
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,322
<i>Making fun of the man
you're betrothed to marry.</i>

207
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,799
<i>Oh, rats!
He's really betrothed
to my father.</i>

208
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:10,892
Hannah Sempler...

209
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,528
Well, they made
the agreement, not I.

210
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:13,628
Parents know better.

211
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,230
How do I look?
I think he likes me.

212
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,672
Who?
Ethan Hoyt, of course.

213
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,266
<i>Hannah Sempler!
Well, he smiled,
didn't he?</i>

214
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,574
He always smiles.
Every time I see him,
he smiles.

215
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,772
<i>That's because
he's a ne'er-do-well.</i>

216
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,508
A what?
It means he lives
with the Indians...

217
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:24,571
Mama says...

218
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,708
...and smells dreadful
like a buffalo.

219
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:26,773
Prove it.

220
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:27,876
He makes his clothes
from dead animals.

221
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,113
<i>Oh, that isn't buffalo.</i>

222
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,212
<i>It's all the same.</i>

223
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,747
Well, then I think buffalos
must smell lovely,

224
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,152
like the fresh air
and the sun.

225
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,694
Where are you going?
Downstairs.

226
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:38,855
<i>But you can't.
Why not?</i>

227
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,398
<i>He's down there.</i>

228
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,263
<i>That's why I'm going.</i>

229
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,865
Where are you going, honey?
Downstairs.

230
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:46,996
<i>Don't you go
in the library.</i>

231
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,130
Why not?

232
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,142
<i>There's a big private
confabulation in there.</i>

233
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,846
But, Delilah,
I need a book.

234
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,280
You gonna need two books
when your father
catch you eavesdropping.

235
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,750
<i>And they ain't going to be
in your hands neither.</i>

236
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,286
<i>Don't you go.</i>

237
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:07,653
Gentlemen, I wish
I had the power to make
you see it with my own eyes.

238
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,058
Two great rivers
coming together
like an arrow.

239
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,255
Like a sign
from the Almighty,
gentlemen.

240
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,856
Pointing out
the natural site
of a great new city.

241
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,400
And the public buildings,
gentlemen,

242
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,163
all grouped around
a great square

243
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,296
filled with fountains
and trees.

244
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,839
And behind
the city, a hill.

245
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:26,071
And on the hill, homes.
Homes, gentlemen.
Filled with light and air.

246
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,238
And the country
itself...

247
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,312
Oh, if I only
had the power.

248
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,516
A virgin land,
like a poem.

249
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,791
Like a young maiden,
just awaking
from a long sleep.

250
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:48,297
As beautiful and as lovely
as an unexpected smile.

251
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,132
<i>I'm sorry, Father.
I thought you might
like some brandy.</i>

252
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,439
Miss Sempler.
Mr. Cadwallader.

253
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,742
My daughter, Hannah,
Mr. Hoyt.

254
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:07,507
Miss Hannah.

255
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,577
Mr. Cadwallader is betrothed
to my daughter.

256
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,083
I see.

257
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,152
Leave the room,
Hannah.

258
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,625
Yes, Father.

259
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,654
<i>To your health.
I'm sure
you'll be very happy.</i>

260
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:37,976
<i>Leave the room at once, miss.
We've had enough
of your childish pranks.</i>

261
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,449
Yes, Father.

262
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,990
You were saying, Mr. Hoyt?

263
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,083
Oh.

264
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,924
Yes, I was saying...

265
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,964
Well, the truth
of the matter is,
Mr. Sempler,

266
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,398
I need your help.
Money and supplies.

267
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,129
You have a branch
in St. Louis

268
00:18:58,203 --> 00:18:59,727
and I came to you
because... Well...

269
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,172
Because no other business firm
would carry your risk.

270
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,510
Because you knew my father,
Mr. Sempler.

271
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,103
Yes, and I had great respect
for his judgment.
Great respect.

272
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,648
<i>That's why I have
listened to you.</i>

273
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,014
<i>I've named the city for him.
Hoyt City.</i>

274
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,712
He was a man
of great vision.

275
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,185
Exactly.

276
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:19,156
Enough vision to say no
to a venture like this.

277
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,452
Exactly.

278
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,417
Well, then you mean...

279
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,859
I mean no.

280
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,029
<i>But there's talk
of a railroad.</i>

281
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,693
<i>Don't you wild men realize
what you're doing?</i>

282
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,429
Talk of expanding
the country.

283
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:36,065
<i>All you're expanding
is the national debt.
Larger army, more taxes.</i>

284
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,366
<i>The country's large enough
as it is.</i>

285
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:45,706
Well, you listen to me
Mr. Sempler.
You too, Mr. Cadwallader.

286
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,351
<i>This country's
going to be bigger.
A whale of a lot bigger, too.</i>

287
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:52,788
There are
2,000 miles of America
out beyond the Mississippi.

288
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,088
Land and riches
beyond belief.

289
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,854
<i>And it's not going to belong
to men like you.
Men who won't take a risk.</i>

290
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,024
<i>It's going to belong to men
that aren't afraid.</i>

291
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,363
Men with luck in one hand
and risk in the other.

292
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,298
<i>Oh, you're so right.
You're so absolutely right.</i>

293
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,470
Excuse me, please.

294
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,482
<i>You think
he's really going to...</i>

295
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,025
I do, indeed.

296
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,021
Then you really
believe in...

297
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:34,031
<i>She's a very headstrong
young girl, Mr. Hoyt.</i>

298
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:39,401
And I suppose
after your marriage
you really intend to...

299
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,200
Oh, yes, indeed.

300
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,366
It helps maintain
the home.

301
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,075
Of course,
out where I come from...

302
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,872
You have women
out West?

303
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,572
Oh, yes. Some.

304
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,615
Yes, but mostly
Indian squaws,
I presume.

305
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:53,116
Mostly.
Only the Indians
have them.

306
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,516
<i>I've heard otherwise.</i>

307
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,316
<i>Well, don't let me
influence you.</i>

308
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,254
Exactly. I thought so.

309
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,254
I suppose that you...

310
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,658
Rope them.

311
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:04,718
You what?

312
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,060
Rope them, Mr. Cadwallader,
and brand them with hot irons

313
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,430
and hang them
on forked sticks
over a hot fire.

314
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:10,559
Who?

315
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,501
Cows, Mr. Cadwallader.

316
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,403
Oh, I thought
we were talking
about women.

317
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,035
Women?

318
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:24,480
<i>Why, if we had women
like you have back here,
we'd treat them like queens.</i>

319
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:29,182
<i>Mr. Hoyt, I'd ask you
to remain
for supper, only...</i>

320
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:30,243
I understand.

321
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,721
Now, just
one thing more.

322
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,189
About the matter of risk.

323
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,783
<i>I don't want you to go away
with the wrong impression.</i>

324
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,261
A good safe risk
is another story.

325
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,531
We take risks
every day.

326
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,067
<i>Why, right this very year
it's a fair risk</i>

327
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,434
<i>that we'll make
only 10% profit
instead of 12.</i>

328
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:47,733
Exactly.

329
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:49,969
<i>That's all right,
gentlemen.</i>

330
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,101
I think you both
lost something.

331
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,805
My odds are all or nothing.
Good night.

332
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,079
I done
warned you,
honey lamb.

333
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,084
What?
About the books.

334
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,143
Appears like to me
you need
the whole library.

335
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,245
<i>Oh, that.
It didn't hurt.</i>

336
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,814
Then what you
standing up for, child?

337
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:10,183
Delilah.

338
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,752
Yes, honey?

339
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,195
Were you
ever engaged?

340
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,789
<i>I ain't telling.</i>

341
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:18,427
<i>I mean, engaged,
it's not like
being married, is it?</i>

342
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:19,862
Sakes, no, child.

343
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:22,839
Engaged is maybe.
And married is done done.

344
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:26,536
<i>Then if a girl got married
she'd have to
let him kiss her?</i>

345
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:29,307
Who kiss who?
What all this nonsense?

346
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:32,282
Mr. Cadwallader.

347
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,579
That little Cadwallader
been trying to fun around?

348
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:35,847
Oh, of course not, Delilah.

349
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,014
Then what for
you worrying?

350
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,625
<i>You don't fool
Delilah none, honey.</i>

351
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,721
<i>Oh, Delilah,
I'm in love.</i>

352
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:49,029
Foolishment.

353
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,293
Were you ever in love?

354
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,770
<i>I ain't telling.</i>

355
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,307
<i>You're the
"ain't telling-est"
person.</i>

356
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,436
<i>Ain't telling
is ain't fooling.
You're just a child.</i>

357
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,079
No, Delilah, not now.

358
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,079
<i>I'm in love. I...</i>

359
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,513
Fum-de-diddle.
Get in bed.

360
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,560
Good night,
sugar lamb.

361
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:05,806
Please go away.

362
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,435
In the morning.

363
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:08,672
For goodness sake.

364
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,806
<i>I mean,
I'm going for good.</i>

365
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:11,906
Oh!

366
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,647
<i>But you'll wake everyone.
Father...</i>

367
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,949
<i>I warn you.
I'll wake the dead.</i>

368
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,654
Are you mad?

369
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,519
Stark, staring mad.

370
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,849
I believe you are.

371
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:23,986
Then come down here.

372
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,154
<i>Oh, I can't.</i>

373
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,198
<i>Then I'll come up there.</i>

374
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,097
Oh, no, no.

375
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,134
Oh!

376
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:08,566
<i>It's...</i>

377
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,041
<i>It's night.</i>

378
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,908
Mmm-hmm.

379
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:19,843
<i>It's</i>

380
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:22,542
quiet.

381
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:25,746
Awfully quiet.

382
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,457
Uh-huh.

383
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:36,928
<i>But it's...
It's public.</i>

384
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,694
Awfully public.

385
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,534
Uh-huh.

386
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:46,335
Well...

387
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,409
Well, sir?

388
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,249
Well, then.

389
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:49,806
They say a full moon
makes people
do strange things.

390
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,273
Yeah, I guess so.

391
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,743
<i>Like it's not me here,
not really.</i>

392
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:56,912
<i>I think we'd
better go back.</i>

393
00:26:57,482 --> 00:26:58,847
Do you
feel strange, too?

394
00:26:58,917 --> 00:26:59,975
Uh-huh.

395
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:02,042
<i>You're afraid
of something.</i>

396
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,644
Uh-huh.
Of what?

397
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:05,346
<i>I don't know.</i>

398
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:06,617
Indians?

399
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:07,680
<i>No, there aren't any.</i>

400
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,953
I know, but pretend.

401
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,051
Pretend what?

402
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,653
That there are Indians.
There really are. Listen.

403
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,403
How do you
stalk them?

404
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,997
Do what?
Stalk, you know,
like hunting.

405
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,676
Well, different ways.

406
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,143
Show me one.

407
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,140
Go on.

408
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:34,579
Well...

409
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:43,387
Go on.

410
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,505
<i>That's fine.</i>

411
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,112
<i>Get down.
They're coming.</i>

412
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,881
For goodness sake.

413
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,959
<i>You shouldn't
be here.</i>

414
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,255
Well, of all things.

415
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:18,852
I mean...
Go on.

416
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,622
You know what I mean.

417
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,257
<i>I can't imagine.</i>

418
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:23,595
I love you.

419
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:24,692
Indeed.

420
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:26,168
Believe me.

421
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,361
Maybe.

422
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,772
<i>Oh, but you have to.
I'm going away.</i>

423
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:32,909
You love me?

424
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:35,501
Maybe.

425
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,707
Oh, please,
you know you do.

426
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,940
Oh, Ethan, yes.

427
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,219
<i>You don't smell
like a buffalo.</i>

428
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,085
Well, not exactly.

429
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,088
<i>You're crying.</i>

430
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:57,927
Here.

431
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:04,635
May I keep it?

432
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:05,767
Yes.

433
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,505
To take with me?

434
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,206
Something of you.

435
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,179
Oh, Ethan.

436
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,214
Take me with you, too.

437
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,288
Storm a-coming.

438
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:30,323
For the good Lord
strikes asunder what man
would join, yea verily.

439
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:34,002
<i>I can't find
the place.</i>

440
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,973
<i>Just read the high spots.
Rain's almost here.</i>

441
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:43,446
Maybe I can do it
without the book!

442
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,908
Do you take this woman
to be your
lawful wedded wife?

443
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:48,077
I do.

444
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,484
And do you...

445
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:54,657
...take this man to be
your lawful wedded husband
till death doth you part?

446
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:55,818
I do.

447
00:29:56,127 --> 00:30:00,860
Then let no one put asunder
whom God hath joined.
I pronounce you man and wife.

448
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:15,475
<i>Plain one's two bits,
pretty one, a dollar.</i>

449
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,879
Of course, the only difference
is the flowers and things.

450
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:20,315
<i>I'll take
the plain one,
please.</i>

451
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:21,941
Flowers fade, anyway.

452
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,681
Yes, flowers fade.

453
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,816
Name?

454
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,255
Ethan Hoyt.

455
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,876
<i>All right. Let's go.</i>

456
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:57,020
<i>Come on.
We've got to
find shelter.</i>

457
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,483
Forgot to
kiss the bride.

458
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:05,093
<i>"Forever," the man said.</i>

459
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,063
<i>That's right, forever.</i>

460
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:28,252
This looks like a good place
to camp for the night.

461
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,287
<i>But, Ethan, it's only
three more miles.</i>

462
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:32,949
<i>Look, Hannah.
There's something
I've got to tell you.</i>

463
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,048
<i>Won't it wait?</i>

464
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,855
Well, I mean,
you take the morning.
Things look brighter.

465
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:38,054
What do you mean?

466
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:39,653
<i>Hoyt City.
Oh, don't worry about that.</i>

467
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:43,223
The way I feel right now
Hoyt City will look
like Philadelphia almost.

468
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,064
<i>That's what I mean.
You mean, it won't.</i>

469
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:46,694
<i>Well, not exactly...
Well, I don't expect it to.</i>

470
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:48,739
But just imagine.
A real bed to sleep in.

471
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:50,797
People, lights,
hot water
and clean clothes.

472
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:51,933
I know, Hannah,
but...

473
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,034
A home on the hill
overlooking the city.

474
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,773
A public square
filled with fountains
and trees.

475
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,872
What kind of trees, Ethan?

476
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,438
Well...

477
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,576
<i>Oh, don't tell me.
I like surprises.</i>

478
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:02,745
<i>That's fine.</i>

479
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,185
Hoyt City.

480
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,954
<i>Oh, I can't wait.
Come on, Ethan.</i>

481
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,103
Well, here we are.

482
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:39,955
Everything
has to start
somewhere.

483
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:45,896
<i>I'm sorry, Hannah.
I wanted to tell you.</i>

484
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,226
I know how it
must have sounded,

485
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,391
<i>like I'm just
a plain liar.</i>

486
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,660
A great city
can grow here.

487
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,997
You really think so?

488
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:54,663
<i>We'll build it, Ethan,
you and I.</i>

489
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:55,728
You bet we will.

490
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:56,899
People will help us.

491
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,136
<i>That's how I meant it,
what it can really be like.</i>

492
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,668
A city glittering in the sun
with towers
like silver and gold.

493
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:03,805
And people, Ethan.

494
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:06,372
Thousands of people
building something
all new and shiny.

495
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:07,577
Just like you said.

496
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,950
<i>It wasn't
all talk either.
Look.</i>

497
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,756
<i>That's where
we're going to live.
There's a start.</i>

498
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,330
Hoyt City is nothing
but a jumping-off point
for the gold fields.

499
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:26,529
But if the railroad
came here...

500
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:29,664
My dear Mr. Hoyt,
railroads cost money.

501
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,498
Can you raise any?

502
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,168
No.
So, you see...

503
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:34,871
<i>Yeah, but I'll get
the money somewhere.</i>

504
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,880
<i>I'm afraid
that's not enough.</i>

505
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,643
Then what do you want?

506
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:39,978
Hoyt City.

507
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,712
A fair share of it.

508
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,755
Say three-quarters
of the land.

509
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:46,584
<i>But you can't.
It's mine.</i>

510
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:49,854
<i>Sit down, Mr. Hoyt.
You're in no position
to argue.</i>

511
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,230
Now play fair with us.
Take my advice.

512
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:01,128
Three-quarters
or nothing.

513
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:02,363
<i>No, I can't.</i>

514
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,498
Why not?

515
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,901
Indians?

516
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,469
My wife.
Rabbits again
for dinner.

517
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,600
<i>Look here, Hoyt.
You'll make money
on this deal.</i>

518
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,500
<i>My wife won't
listen to it.</i>

519
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,670
<i>Well, what's that
got to do with business?</i>

520
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,974
She owns half.

521
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:44,878
Then get her
to see it our way.

522
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,814
<i>It's to
her own advantage.</i>

523
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,078
Now listen, Hoyt.

524
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:51,952
I happen to know her father.
Fine man.
Fine Philadelphia home.

525
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:54,320
<i>What's she becoming
out here?</i>

526
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,087
A crack shot,
among other things.

527
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,525
She deserves better.

528
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,062
Give her back
what she had.

529
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:03,032
A real home, clothes,
social position
like my wife and daughter.

530
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,496
Get her to
sign over the land.

531
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:12,339
<i>You don't want her to
turn into one of these
prairie women, do you, Hoyt?</i>

532
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,646
Hannah, this is
Mr. Frisbee.

533
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,511
Howdy.

534
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:26,747
Got to clean these
here rabbits, Ethan.

535
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:31,318
Uh, Mr. Frisbee
wants you to sign this
little paper, dear.

536
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:35,255
Uh, let the
rabbits wait, dear.

537
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:36,625
This is important.

538
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:39,499
<i>Nothing ain't important
as vittles, Ethan.</i>

539
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,066
You see?

540
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:45,337
Please, dear.
Stop this foolishness.

541
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,109
<i>It's just a matter
of signature.</i>

542
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,373
<i>It's a land transfer,
Hannah.</i>

543
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,712
You mean
you want me to
sign it, Ethan?

544
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,249
Yes.

545
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:05,329
But I forgot
how to write.

546
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,896
Well, here.
Just make your mark
on the paper there.

547
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:12,426
Oh.

548
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,095
There you are.
Hannah.

549
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,470
Well, I must say.
Scat!

550
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,065
Go on. Get out.

551
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:25,446
Get out and stay out,
you miserable, little, sneaky,
little, stuffy, little...

552
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,881
You rabbit!

553
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,282
<i>Now he'll never
come back.</i>

554
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,861
You mean
you really wanted me
to sign it, Ethan?

555
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,795
<i>It's not a matter
of what we want.
It's a matter of fact.</i>

556
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,854
<i>Hoyt City's a failure.</i>

557
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:42,922
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

558
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,467
<i>Don't believe what?
That you can
change like this.</i>

559
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,661
Give up so easily.

560
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,704
<i>But it's not me, it's...</i>

561
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,628
Look.

562
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,334
<i>Oh, I don't mind.</i>

563
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,334
I want to fill it
with diamonds and gold.

564
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:55,709
Ethan.
Yes?

565
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,270
I had a dream.

566
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:58,337
So did I.

567
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,815
No, I mean
a dream about gold.

568
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,284
Oh, maybe it sounds silly,
but I really did.

569
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:05,151
A misty sort of dream
about a mountain of gold.

570
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,623
A black mountain
with a sunny peak,

571
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:10,419
like a beckoning finger
in the sky.

572
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:11,552
But I thought
you said...

573
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:12,755
<i>I've changed my mind.</i>

574
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,422
<i>You mean we'll go?
Tomorrow.</i>

575
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:15,624
Hannah.
But, Ethan.

576
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,758
<i>Yes?
We'll come back.</i>

577
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,825
With our pockets bulging.
Gold flowers for your hair.

578
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,098
<i>No, I mean to Hoyt City.
To finish what we've begun.</i>

579
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:22,230
You bet we will.

580
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:27,141
<i>We'll come back and lick
Dawson and Frisbee and the
whole Western Railroad crowd.</i>

581
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:28,469
<i>I'm off.</i>

582
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:29,740
Where?

583
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,915
Down to see the boys.
Get things organized.

584
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,096
<i>What's up?
We're off.</i>

585
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,794
Where for?
California.

586
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,400
How much gold
you need, Ethan?

587
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,907
Fifty, maybe
a hundred thousand.

588
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:00,068
Dawson and the railroad gang
got millions.

589
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:01,441
Then make it a million.

590
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:02,774
Million-dollar Hoyt.

591
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,371
A mountain of gold, boys.

592
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,378
Well, it takes money
to get there.

593
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,080
How much you got?

594
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,554
$100.

595
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,549
Right over here, friends.
Try your luck
with Steely Edwards.

596
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,753
Turn your dollar
into 100.

597
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:20,262
Turn your 100
into 1,000.

598
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,356
How much did
you say you had?

599
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:23,991
Got $100.

600
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,298
<i>Here's your chance.</i>

601
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:29,163
I got to get home, boys.

602
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,037
Get things organized.

603
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:34,043
<i>We could use that $1,000
he's talking about.</i>

604
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,544
Turn your 1,000
into a million.

605
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:36,671
<i>You can't lose
without trying.</i>

606
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,715
<i>It's all in the cards
three-card monte,
gentlemen.</i>

607
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,114
I want your money.

608
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:42,982
<i>The game's crooked,
the cards are fixed.
You can't win.</i>

609
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,681
<i>But who's got the money?</i>

610
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:48,156
I take no bets from widows,
paupers, orphans or cripples.

611
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:50,056
<i>Now, who's got the money
to bet on the ace?</i>

612
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:52,027
The winning card,
the ace of hearts.

613
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:53,825
Watch closely,
the hand is quicker
than the eye.

614
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:56,332
<i>And you're beaten
before you start.</i>

615
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,028
<i>Come, come, gentlemen.
Who's got the money?</i>

616
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:00,764
I got $100.

617
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:03,832
Eye on the ace, friend.
Watch closely.

618
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,804
Here it is.
Now here. Here.

619
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,770
And now where?

620
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:18,186
<i>I told you,
you can't win, friend.</i>

621
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:22,915
Try it again.

622
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,453
For what stakes?

623
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:28,757
My horse.

624
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,630
Eye on the ace,
friend. Watch it closely.

625
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,171
Here it is.
Now, here, here.

626
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:37,104
Now where?

627
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,698
Two horses.

628
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,134
Two cows.

629
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:17,173
Six pigs.

630
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:18,980
Chickens.

631
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:20,448
Hannah Hoyt.

632
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,392
<i>I wasn't counting
on you, madam.</i>

633
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:37,696
But I assure you after
I get the animals bedded
down for the night...

634
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,827
<i>I didn't come here
to talk nonsense.</i>

635
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:41,667
You better be careful.
That thing might go off.

636
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,331
It might.

637
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,068
<i>You're a very
frightening young lady.</i>

638
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:46,905
I want everything back.

639
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:48,001
But a very lovely one.

640
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:49,102
You heard what I said.

641
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,545
Naturally.

642
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,138
<i>But that's contrary
to the sport.</i>

643
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:54,047
Sport? You call it sport
to cheat a man.

644
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,210
To take advantage
when he...

645
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,548
He was only
slightly, madam.

646
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,054
<i>As a matter of fact,
I'm drunk, too.</i>

647
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:02,954
Completely intoxicated
by the mere sight of
the loveliest little assassin

648
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,892
that ever had designs
on my heart.

649
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,725
<i>Stop that silly talk
or I'll shoot.</i>

650
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,490
I believe you might.

651
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,228
Then do as I say.

652
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:14,103
<i>Madam, you're welcome
to the animals.
But as for the money...</i>

653
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,468
I want that, too.
We need it.

654
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:18,599
<i>It's all we have in the world.
It means we can go away.</i>

655
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:23,079
<i>I'll tell you what.
I won't give you the money,
but I'll play you for it.</i>

656
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,647
Against what?

657
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:28,912
A kiss.
Just a little one.

658
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:35,189
<i>Otherwise,
you'll have to
shoot me, I guess.</i>

659
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,057
You deal.

660
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,432
<i>I'm on the wrong side
of the table this time.</i>

661
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:31,941
Wow.

662
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:54,660
Hannah.

663
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:55,796
Yes?

664
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,971
<i>Aren't you gonna
say something?</i>

665
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:04,137
<i>Supper's almost ready.
Better wash your hands.</i>

666
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:08,247
<i>No, I mean,
aren't you gonna say
something about...</i>

667
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:12,245
No.

668
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,527
Eat your supper, Ethan.

669
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,394
<i>There's a lot of work to do
if we're going
to be leaving tomorrow.</i>

670
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,978
We were as young as you
in those days.

671
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:37,673
All three of us.

672
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:41,746
Ethan and I
and Steely Edwards.

673
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,321
He tagged after me
for eight long years.

674
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:49,216
The gambler?

675
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,555
The man.

676
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,960
He was the other man
in my life.

677
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:55,095
<i>"Gambler."</i>

678
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:00,265
<i>Things don't turn out
the way you expect.</i>

679
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:04,396
<i>Just like we thought
we'd find that mountain
of gold</i>

680
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:07,206
and come right back here
to Hoyt City.

681
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:09,541
But Senator Hoyt
discovered silver.

682
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:12,343
<i>In a way he did
and in a way he didn't.</i>

683
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,181
But that was
after eight years.

684
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:20,090
Eight wonderful,
terrible years.

685
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:24,359
Wandering up and down
the whole Pacific Coast,

686
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:26,396
wherever there was
a mountain.

687
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:31,462
Wonderful times,
when Ethan and I
were alone.

688
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:36,536
Terrible times
when he was away.

689
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,078
Every time he came home

690
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,339
there was Steely Edwards.

691
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:48,143
You mean
you and Steely Edwards?

692
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:50,118
Hold your horses, girl.

693
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:55,889
<i>I don't deny
there were moments.</i>

694
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,052
Hmm.

695
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:02,955
There was something
pretty nice about Steely.

696
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:08,803
<i>But that's as far as it went.
I loved Ethan too much.</i>

697
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:16,240
That was when Ethan
was in the Washoe Mountains,
a place called Virginia City.

698
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,873
Yes, I was running
a boarding house
in Sacramento and...

699
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:41,663
I bought two tickets
for the concert.

700
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,400
<i>I can't go, Steely,
but thanks.</i>

701
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:44,907
<i>That's what
you always say.</i>

702
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:46,602
By this time
you ought to know
what I mean.

703
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:48,668
<i>I don't know.
All I know is...</i>

704
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,304
Do me a favor.
Anything.

705
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,041
Go down to the faro house
and leave me alone.

706
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:54,812
<i>Thought you said
you didn't like gambling.</i>

707
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:56,785
<i>I don't call it
working for a living.</i>

708
00:45:56,854 --> 00:46:00,312
Thanks. I suppose Ethan
never gambled in his life.

709
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,620
<i>He's got nothing
to do with it.</i>

710
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:04,917
<i>That's just
the point.</i>

711
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:08,362
<i>For eight years he hasn't
had anything to do
with anything but himself.</i>

712
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,195
Except when
he comes home
for a bath or a...

713
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,198
Oh, Steely,
forgive me.

714
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:21,567
<i>It's just that...
I'm not quite myself.</i>

715
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:25,445
<i>You see, Ethan and I,
we're going to
have a baby.</i>

716
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:30,552
Take your hands
off my wife.

717
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,111
Ethan!

718
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:35,018
Steely, please go.

719
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:38,161
Not till
we settle this
once and for all.

720
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:39,286
<i>That's all right
with me.</i>

721
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:40,728
Ethan, please.

722
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:41,822
Every time
I come home...

723
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:43,230
<i>You don't know
what you're saying!</i>

724
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,291
I know
what I see.

725
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:48,227
I never
carry a gun,
friend.

726
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:52,207
Lucky for you.
Get out and stay out.

727
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:55,604
Go on, Steely.
Go on now, please.

728
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,133
Ethan,
come eat something.

729
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:18,725
In the morning.

730
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:21,503
<i>I can't help
wondering.</i>

731
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:23,270
About what?

732
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:24,968
Steely.

733
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:27,668
You know better.

734
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:29,976
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

735
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:35,508
<i>But there's
something else.</i>

736
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:37,219
Will it keep?

737
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:38,849
Mmm-hmm.

738
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:44,319
<i>Well, then save it
till morning, will you?
I'm tired. Dog tired.</i>

739
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:53,062
Got a spare bed for a miner
down on his luck, Mrs. Hoyt?

740
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:54,364
Mmm-hmm.

741
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,071
Fine.

742
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:00,374
Nothing?

743
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:02,309
Same old story.

744
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:05,904
<i>A little gold,
but you can't get it out
of that blue stuff.</i>

745
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:08,110
Sticky-as-pitch
blue stuff.

746
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:11,713
<i>Some people
claim it's silver,
but they're crazy.</i>

747
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,289
It just gets in the way.

748
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:17,326
<i>Oh, look out.
It's all over my boots.</i>

749
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:22,128
Strange country
up there,
Virginia City.

750
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:26,292
A black hill called
the Sun Mountain.

751
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:31,029
Like a beckoning
finger in the sky.

752
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:33,676
Sun Mountain.

753
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,924
Like a beckoning finger
in the sky.

754
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:56,364
<i>Great Scott! It's silver!
Literally solid!
lt'll run $5,000 a ton.</i>

755
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:58,699
<i>We're rich.</i>

756
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:02,232
<i>We're rich!
We're rich!</i>

757
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:05,439
<i>We're rich!</i>

758
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:06,999
Who is rich?
Steely!

759
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:08,510
<i>Your humble servant.
Who's rich?</i>

760
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:11,638
<i>It's Ethan that's rich!
On his boots,
silver, gobs of it!</i>

761
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:14,775
Big feet
but a small mind.

762
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:16,949
Steely, lend me
some money.

763
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,009
Why?

764
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:19,521
You know why.
For him?

765
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:20,954
<i>For me.
I'll pay it all back.</i>

766
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:24,016
<i>Every cent
from the Hoyt House.
I'll cook, I'll scrub.</i>

767
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:26,426
<i>Oh, Steely,
I'll pay it all back.</i>

768
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:28,086
<i>You mean
you're going to
stay here?</i>

769
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:29,223
Yes.

770
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:31,026
<i>And he'll let you stay?</i>

771
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:33,433
<i>He doesn't know about me.
I couldn't tell him, not now.</i>

772
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:37,735
<i>Then he wouldn't go.
Not if he knew.
You wouldn't go, Steely.</i>

773
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:39,898
No.

774
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,069
<i>Oh, don't you see?</i>

775
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,975
<i>It's his big chance.
It's what
he's been looking for.</i>

776
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:45,480
Grubbing and digging
his way through the mountains
for eight years.

777
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:48,643
<i>He's got to go, Steely!
Alone.</i>

778
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:58,522
You know, if some woman
felt like that about me,

779
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:04,534
and her name was Hannah...

780
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:05,795
Steely.

781
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,496
Oh, Steely!

782
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:15,035
Silver! Solid silver,
I tell you! Richest ore
I ever saw in my life.

783
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:16,977
Silver! Silver!

784
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:18,036
Who found it?

785
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:19,912
Ethan Hoyt.
His wife!

786
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:22,847
Silver! Silver! Silver!

787
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:38,727
Ethan!
Huh?

788
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:40,360
Ethan, wake up!
Hmm, what is it?

789
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:42,701
Silver.
That blue stuff
on your boots!

790
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:43,797
Solid silver!

791
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:47,970
Oh, Ethan, hurry.

792
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:54,343
Here, get out
the back way. Hurry!

793
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:57,049
<i>What's that?
Money to buy mines.</i>

794
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:58,849
Money to buy...
Where did you get it?

795
00:50:58,922 --> 00:50:59,946
<i>Hurry, don't argue.</i>

796
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:01,012
<i>Where'd you get it?</i>

797
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:02,581
Steely Edwards.

798
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:03,683
<i>That's what I thought.</i>

799
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:08,929
<i>You're coming with me.</i>

800
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:10,330
No.
Why not?

801
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,526
<i>I can't.
Why not?</i>

802
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:12,693
<i>I can't
tell you, Ethan.</i>

803
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:15,294
<i>Oh, you can't tell me, huh?
Or maybe I can guess.
Look at me.</i>

804
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:16,361
Yes, Ethan.

805
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,771
Straight in my eyes.
Yes.

806
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:19,240
<i>You can't tell me?
No.</i>

807
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:20,298
Then I know.

808
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:22,436
<i>Oh, Ethan, please.
You can't go like this
thinking what you do.</i>

809
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:23,979
Well, what else
am I to think, Hannah?

810
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:27,480
Ethan, you have to go.

811
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:28,711
Answer me.

812
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:29,774
Oh.

813
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:34,957
<i>All right, I'll go.</i>

814
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:43,889
<i>But I'll never come back.</i>

815
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:46,495
Good luck, Ethan.

816
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,337
<i>Why don't you go, too?</i>

817
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:30,478
Like all the others,
over the next hill?

818
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:39,382
<i>Because I've already
come over that hill, Hannah.</i>

819
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:45,155
This is all I want.

820
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:09,549
Looks like everybody is
getting out of Sacramento
as fast as they can.

821
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:12,144
<i>They're all going down
to the boat, Mr. Steely.</i>

822
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:15,658
You better throw away
this horse and get back
to San Francisco.

823
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:19,456
<i>Maybe you're right.
Go on back and
save my place on the boat.</i>

824
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:36,270
<i>Armor's Diggings,
Salmon Flats, Placerville
and Carson City!</i>

825
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:39,975
Connections for
the Washoe stage, Cold Hill
and Virginia City!

826
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,985
<i>Last stage out of
Sacramento, mister.
The flood's coming.</i>

827
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:46,819
Do you connect
with the stage
for Virginia City?

828
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,653
Yeah, at Carson City.
Get in.

829
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:56,722
Not for myself.

830
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:02,099
For a lady
and two small babies,
for Virginia City.

831
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,815
<i>Steely Edwards,
you're a Godsend!</i>

832
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:50,819
Had no idea
it was this bad.

833
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:52,718
Here, take the babies.
Help us down to the boat.

834
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:53,778
Boat?

835
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:55,381
<i>Yes, we're going
to San Francisco.</i>

836
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:58,587
<i>What's the matter?</i>

837
00:54:58,895 --> 00:54:59,919
Nothing.

838
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:03,056
Well, come along.
You always said you wanted
to take me on a trip.

839
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,101
<i>If you wait any longer,
it'll be too late. Come on.</i>

840
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:09,229
<i>It's been too late.
Ever since the first time
I met you, Hannah.</i>

841
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,968
What do you mean?

842
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:14,442
<i>You're not going
to San Francisco.</i>

843
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:16,575
<i>You're going
to Virginia City.</i>

844
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,546
<i>Oh, no, Steely.
No, I can't.</i>

845
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:19,843
Why not?

846
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:23,019
<i>Well, I've never
heard from him.</i>

847
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:26,752
<i>Look, Hannah, you love him,
that's all that matters.</i>

848
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,991
<i>All your life
you've swallowed your pride
and gone back to him.</i>

849
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,118
You can do it again.

850
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:34,490
All aboard.

851
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:48,035
Oh, I almost forgot.

852
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:51,537
I got something
for Mary.

853
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:54,605
Oh!

854
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,049
I got Ethan a horse.

855
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:57,108
A what?

856
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,621
<i>It's on rockers.
Little one.
It's up on the roof.</i>

857
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,247
Oh, Steely!

858
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:02,916
All aboard.

859
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:26,748
Whoa!

860
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:32,748
Giddyup!

861
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,925
My sweet babies.

862
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:58,203
You know, if they
were alive today,

863
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:02,040
<i>they'd be 76 years old.</i>

864
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,949
My children, 76.

865
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:13,480
Goodness, I must be
the oldest woman
in the world.

866
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:16,351
Mrs. Hoyt.

867
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:17,654
Hmm?

868
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,524
<i>Perhaps you're tired.</i>

869
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:22,126
Steely thought
I was dead, too.

870
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:26,435
<i>That's why he went up
to Virginia City.</i>

871
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:32,935
<i>One snowy night
way back in 1860</i>

872
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:35,706
<i>or '61...</i>

873
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,089
Whiskey.

874
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,825
Leave the bottle.

875
00:58:58,835 --> 00:58:59,824
Look out.

876
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:07,965
Save your money, stranger.
Have another bottle on me.

877
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,945
When Ethan Hoyt
buys drinks,
he buys them all.

878
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:12,003
That right, boys?

879
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:13,070
<i>That's right, Ethan.</i>

880
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:14,138
Million-dollar Hoyt!

881
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:18,347
A mountain of silver
and Ethan Hoyt on top.
You hear that, stranger?

882
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:21,518
A mountain of silver
and Ethan Hoyt on...

883
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:44,941
Stop where you are.

884
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:49,383
Take your hand
out of your pocket.

885
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:54,683
You know
I never carry a gun.

886
00:59:56,893 --> 00:59:58,520
Drop that bottle.

887
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,832
I only came to
tell you something.

888
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:07,431
Then start talking.

889
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,432
<i>It's about Hannah.</i>

890
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:15,667
What about her?

891
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:19,346
<i>She's dead.</i>

892
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:42,731
He killed my wife.

893
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:48,709
<i>That's what he did.
My wife, Hannah.</i>

894
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:31,109
<i>I know now what you meant
when you said,
"Come back in 100 years."</i>

895
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:38,994
A hundred years
of greatness,
heartbreak, sorrow.

896
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:43,960
<i>Only in spots, girl.
That's the way life goes.</i>

897
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,533
You get used to it
after a while.

898
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:00,443
Hello, Martha.
Hello, John. How are you?

899
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:01,505
Glad to see you.

900
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:02,573
<i>Oh, there's Mary.</i>

901
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:05,348
<i>Be with you
in a minute.
The lady's bag.</i>

902
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:09,949
<i>That's it.
One more bag.</i>

903
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:40,149
I thought
you were dead.

904
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:45,879
I am.

905
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:52,284
<i>Ethan thinks
we're both dead.</i>

906
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:54,189
Ethan?

907
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:56,729
He shot me.

908
01:03:58,201 --> 01:03:59,600
Where is he?

909
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:03,462
He went back
to Hoyt City.

910
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:11,309
<i>Hannah, he's married.
He married again.</i>

911
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:25,721
To whom?

912
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:29,289
A girl named
Martha Dawson.

913
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:34,027
Hmm.

914
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:40,236
<i>It's all my fault, Hannah.
I sent you on that stage.</i>

915
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:42,267
I wanted to go.

916
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:47,313
<i>I'll win some money.
I'll send you back east.</i>

917
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:48,574
No.

918
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:53,151
<i>But, Hannah,
he doesn't know
you're alive.</i>

919
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:55,949
Better this way.

920
01:04:57,193 --> 01:05:00,287
<i>I can't stop him now.
He's doing what he wanted.</i>

921
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:05,132
What I want him to do.
To build a great city.
To be a great man.

922
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:09,032
He will be, Steely.

923
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:12,964
<i>I can't stand in his way.</i>

924
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:17,071
<i>Hannah, you can't
do this to yourself.</i>

925
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:19,538
<i>I don't matter.</i>

926
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,314
But if my babies...

927
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,124
I buried them, Hannah.

928
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:39,861
Where?

929
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:41,797
Where...

930
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,864
Where little angels sleep.

931
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:11,832
<i>Then we're all dead
for him. All four of us.</i>

932
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:14,325
<i>That's how
it was meant to be.</i>

933
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:18,899
Steely.

934
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,033
Yes?

935
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:23,473
<i>That's the boat
to San Francisco.</i>

936
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:29,849
You said it was
too late one time.

937
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:35,079
<i>Now it's too late
for anything else.</i>

938
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:58,175
One of our very finest
show places, sir.

939
01:06:58,247 --> 01:07:00,772
Just as modern
as 1868 itself.

940
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,216
A credit to the city
of San Francisco, sir.

941
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:04,843
Erected by
Mr. Steely Edwards.

942
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,353
Save your oratory
for the Senate.

943
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:07,889
For the Senate.

944
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:11,222
You say the woman
who calls herself
Hannah Hoyt works here?

945
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:12,317
<i>That's right,
Mr. Sempler.</i>

946
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:15,554
Well, come along.

947
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:17,622
No, let me
handle this,
please.

948
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:18,689
And why?

949
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:20,133
<i>Because if Steely Edwards
knows what you're after,</i>

950
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,432
<i>you'll never get
past the door.</i>

951
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:34,308
Come right in, gentlemen.
Try your luck
with Steely Edwards.

952
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,044
Friends of mine, Steely.
From the east.

953
01:07:36,118 --> 01:07:39,212
<i>They're interested in seeing
your establishment.</i>

954
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:42,816
Delighted to
show you around,
Senator.

955
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:48,626
<i>You know, gentlemen,
it's a peculiar thing.</i>

956
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:52,126
<i>But the more I tell people
that the game is crooked
and they can't win,</i>

957
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:53,634
the more they seem
to enjoy losing.

958
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:58,433
Of course we let them
win once in a while.
But they lose it right back.

959
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:02,307
<i>If it isn't faro,
it's hazard or three-card
monte or roulette.</i>

960
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:05,805
Fascinating game,
roulette.

961
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:09,276
<i>You can't lose
without trying, gentlemen.
Why not test your luck?</i>

962
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:10,648
Delighted.

963
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:14,314
The special table
with the most beautiful
croupier in the business.

964
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:17,359
<i>She'll help you lose
your money with
the greatest of pleasure.</i>

965
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,291
<i>But she won't help you
spend any of it.</i>

966
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:21,418
No more bets,
gentlemen.

967
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:22,794
Keep your eye
on the little ball.

968
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:26,164
<i>Don't expect miracles,
gentlemen.
Lose with a smile.</i>

969
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:30,270
Excuse me, sir. Hannah?

970
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:35,107
Father.

971
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:44,783
Is there some place
we can talk?

972
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:47,851
Steely, take my place,
please.

973
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:54,023
All bets down, please.
All bets down.

974
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:59,127
<i>Forgive this clutter.
It's Steely's office.</i>

975
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:02,068
I straighten it up
myself every day,
but you know how men are.

976
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,264
Oh, tell me
all about yourself.

977
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:05,534
About sweet old Delilah
and Bettina and Persis, too.

978
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:07,735
I bet you married one of them.
Which one, Mr. Cadwallader?

979
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:10,643
<i>"Mama says."
I mean Bettina.</i>

980
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,205
<i>Father, I'm so glad
to see you.</i>

981
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:14,806
<i>Now stop it, Hannah.
There's a time and place
for everything.</i>

982
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:17,409
I came here
with a business proposition,
nothing more.

983
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:18,510
A what?

984
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:21,852
<i>Everyone thinks you're dead.
So did I, until today.</i>

985
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:24,625
I want you to
remain dead, legally.

986
01:09:25,261 --> 01:09:26,421
But I...

987
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:28,825
<i>I don't know
what you mean, Father.</i>

988
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:30,456
You still call yourself
Hannah Hoyt?

989
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:31,591
Yes.

990
01:09:32,034 --> 01:09:35,834
<i>I don't suppose
you're married to this
Steely Edwards fellow?</i>

991
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:39,532
<i>I'm married to Ethan Hoyt.</i>

992
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:42,441
<i>But he's married to
J.B. Dawson's daughter.</i>

993
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:45,077
I know it.

994
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:49,072
He has a fine reputation.
Fine home.
Two fine children.

995
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:51,308
Two children?

996
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:55,016
So I want you to
change your name and go away.
Far away somewhere.

997
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:57,320
<i>I'll make it
worth your while.</i>

998
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:04,758
It means
everything to me.
Everything.

999
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:09,928
<i>Then if you won't do it
for me, do it for Ethan.
You owe it to him, Hannah.</i>

1000
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:13,701
He got nothing
but wild ideas
from you and failure.

1001
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:15,243
<i>He's come a long way
without you.</i>

1002
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:18,109
The least breath of scandal
would ruin him.

1003
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:20,410
Dawson and I need him
in Congress.

1004
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:23,178
<i>He's running against
a hothead from Hoyt City.</i>

1005
01:10:23,252 --> 01:10:25,584
A dreamer who thinks
that building Hoyt City

1006
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:28,384
is more important
than building a railroad.

1007
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:30,857
<i>Why, great Scott,
if Ethan's not elected,</i>

1008
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:32,860
I hate to think what
it would mean for all of us!

1009
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:34,190
Please go.

1010
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:35,662
I might have known.

1011
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:37,062
Get out.

1012
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:38,121
For the last time...

1013
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,191
Get out of here!
Get out!

1014
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:02,951
The house wins, gentlemen.
The house always wins.

1015
01:11:06,228 --> 01:11:07,752
<i>What's the matter?</i>

1016
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:10,321
<i>I'm going back
to Hoyt City, Steely.</i>

1017
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,768
No more bets, gentlemen.

1018
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:15,329
Ethan?

1019
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:21,673
Double O.

1020
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:24,977
<i>The game is
against you, gentlemen.
You can't win.</i>

1021
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:27,511
Better luck
next time.

1022
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:34,822
Better luck yourself,
Steely Edwards.

1023
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:45,826
<i>My friend Ethan Hoyt
says that if he's not elected,</i>

1024
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:49,359
the Western Railroad Company
will change its plans

1025
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:52,305
and cross the river
10 miles south of here.

1026
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:55,076
This is a threat, folks.

1027
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:58,407
Ethan Hoyt never
used to talk like this.

1028
01:11:58,781 --> 01:12:01,409
He used to say
like all the rest of us,

1029
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:05,417
<i>"Give us the railroad
on fair terms
or we'll build one ourselves."</i>

1030
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:09,184
<i>Now he tells us,
"Boys, give the
Western Railroad</i>

1031
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:14,093
<i>"three-quarters of everything
in sight, or we'll ruin you
and your city forever."</i>

1032
01:12:14,363 --> 01:12:17,298
Oh, if I only had
the silver tongue
of Ethan Hoyt...

1033
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:20,335
I object to that last remark
as a mean and
unprincipled slander!

1034
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:21,960
I meant no slander, sir.

1035
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:26,599
<i>If the word "silver" bothers
your conscience in any way,
suppose I say "golden."</i>

1036
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:29,974
<i>If I had a golden voice
like Ethan Hoyt's,</i>

1037
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:32,711
I would use it
to tell the truth.

1038
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:35,809
I would use it
to speak for all of us.

1039
01:12:36,318 --> 01:12:41,017
<i>We're the little people,
but we're trying
to build something big.</i>

1040
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:46,053
Ethan Hoyt.

1041
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:58,967
Friends, I beg your indulgence
for just a few final remarks

1042
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:02,772
in reply to
my old friend and rival
for Congress, Hank Allen,

1043
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:06,071
who reminds me of a dog
I had when I was a boy.

1044
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:07,849
<i>The dog's name
was Hank, too.</i>

1045
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:13,615
Well, one day Hank...
The dog, mind you.

1046
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:19,327
One day
Hank caught a squirrel
all by himself.

1047
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:21,226
It was a pretty miserable
little old squirrel,

1048
01:13:21,296 --> 01:13:23,025
but it was a squirrel
just the same,

1049
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:24,429
and I needed
a piece of its fur

1050
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,730
to finish a hunting cap
I was making myself.

1051
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:29,464
That poor squirrel
was no good at all to Hank

1052
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:31,699
<i>because he didn't know
what to do with it.</i>

1053
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:34,572
<i>But do you think
he'd let me have it?
No, sir.</i>

1054
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:38,238
He just growled and barked
and kept it all to himself,

1055
01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:41,476
till it was no good
to anybody,
not even himself.

1056
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:46,180
<i>That's what Hank Allen
is trying to do.</i>

1057
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:52,119
I founded this town.
I and others.

1058
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:55,986
But the time has come
when we must face the facts.

1059
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:58,931
Hoyt City is nothing
but a jumping-off place
for nowhere.

1060
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:01,492
The railroad would put
Hoyt City on the map.

1061
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:03,060
I came back here
a month ago

1062
01:14:03,138 --> 01:14:07,575
to live in the same
little cabin I built here
21 years ago in 1847.

1063
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:10,210
I am one of yourselves.

1064
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:16,081
<i>True enough, I own
a great deal of land here.
I don't deny it.</i>

1065
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:20,687
But most of this land
I shall have to deed over to
the railroad, the same as you.

1066
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:24,590
I shall be poorer, not richer.
Hank Allen to the contrary.

1067
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:32,590
My friends, I take my stand
for the Western Railroad
Company and progress.

1068
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:56,758
And now for Mr. Frisbee.

1069
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:04,329
As for you Ethan Hoyt,

1070
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:10,904
guilty conscience, huh?

1071
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:15,407
No wonder you thought
you saw her
there in the crowd.

1072
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:20,808
<i>Hank Allen was right.
"Silver-tongue Hoyt."</i>

1073
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,306
Remember
the moonlight, Ethan?

1074
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:20,602
Hannah.

1075
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:23,404
What a strange,
lovely night.

1076
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,975
And we rode away,
you and I.

1077
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:30,780
All the wide, bright way
to the Pacific sea.

1078
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:34,787
Then it was really you
this afternoon.

1079
01:16:34,856 --> 01:16:35,914
Yes.

1080
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:38,653
<i>Yes, I didn't die.</i>

1081
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:41,925
I was bringing you
our babies.

1082
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:45,293
They were as tiny
as kittens.

1083
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:48,465
Little twin kittens.

1084
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:53,065
Steely found them
after the flood.
He thought I was dead, too.

1085
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:57,269
And after he came back
from Virginia City, he...

1086
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:01,478
He told me about you.

1087
01:17:04,419 --> 01:17:06,512
And then I went away
with him.

1088
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:09,284
Oh, God.
Forgive me, Hannah.
Forgive me.

1089
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:14,853
<i>I failed you.
I've always failed you.</i>

1090
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:20,090
Oh!

1091
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:23,203
Oh, my goodness, Ethan.

1092
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:29,441
Get up off the ground.
There are no Indians
to stalk around here.

1093
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:33,137
I remember.
And then I...

1094
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:36,878
And then I went away with you
for 12 glorious years.

1095
01:17:51,233 --> 01:17:55,363
<i>It's chilly.
Come inside, Ethan.</i>

1096
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,480
Light your candle
again, Ethan.

1097
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:13,947
<i>I'm like
a blind man, Hannah.
A man in the dark.</i>

1098
01:18:14,389 --> 01:18:16,289
<i>That's why
I came back.</i>

1099
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:34,706
<i>You'll see again, Ethan.
You'll see
what Hank Allen sees.</i>

1100
01:18:34,776 --> 01:18:38,007
What you yourself
used to see better
than any man on Earth.

1101
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:42,540
A fine, bright world.
We started
to build it once.

1102
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:47,486
<i>But it's not as simple
as all that, Hannah.
I've changed.</i>

1103
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:52,757
I came back here alone
and tried to build
what we dreamed together.

1104
01:18:52,828 --> 01:18:55,729
You and I.
But it was no good
alone, Hannah.

1105
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:58,231
The heart was
gone out of me.

1106
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:01,565
<i>Oh, I don't want to make
any excuses, not anymore.</i>

1107
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:04,501
I guess I just took
the easiest way.

1108
01:19:04,973 --> 01:19:09,706
<i>Just like I've always done,
except when you've been around
to keep me straight.</i>

1109
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:13,843
<i>I'm in this thing
just as deep
as the rest of them.</i>

1110
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:17,282
Corrupting judges
and legislators
to get what we want.

1111
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:19,813
Money is a great
power, Hannah.

1112
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:23,221
And my money is tied up with
the Western Railroad Company.

1113
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:26,852
So, you see,
if I fight Dawson
and those people,

1114
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:28,919
<i>I'd really be
fighting myself.</i>

1115
01:19:28,997 --> 01:19:31,659
<i>But that's right.
That's what you must do.</i>

1116
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:34,167
<i>Then you've got
to help me, Hannah.</i>

1117
01:19:35,303 --> 01:19:38,761
<i>I can't do it alone.
Without you
I've been lost.</i>

1118
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:42,604
<i>You're not alone, Ethan.
You have a family.</i>

1119
01:19:42,677 --> 01:19:46,044
Yes, a little boy
and a little girl.

1120
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:52,315
<i>But there's
you, too, Hannah.</i>

1121
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:54,445
<i>I'm all mixed up.</i>

1122
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:57,754
<i>No, you're not.
I've divorced you.</i>

1123
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:00,252
When?

1124
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:02,057
Before I came here.

1125
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:07,832
<i>Not because I don't love you,
because I always will.</i>

1126
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:12,968
But because our marriage
was the only weapon
they could use against you.

1127
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:14,065
<i>But I can't
let you do this.</i>

1128
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:16,201
<i>You've got to
do it, Ethan.</i>

1129
01:20:16,578 --> 01:20:19,274
Speak for all the things
we dreamed together.

1130
01:20:19,347 --> 01:20:20,780
Speak for the truth
and fight for it.

1131
01:20:20,849 --> 01:20:22,646
Speak for
all the people to hear.

1132
01:20:22,717 --> 01:20:25,151
Help them to
build something
fine and free.

1133
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:29,122
A country that
your little boy and girl,

1134
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:34,089
that all our children
will be proud
to inherit and live in.

1135
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:35,894
<i>I'll do it.</i>

1136
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:40,334
I know you will, Ethan.

1137
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:42,836
If only we were
beginning all over.

1138
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:47,438
Spring never comes
again, Ethan.

1139
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:52,207
<i>Perhaps in the Indian summer
we'll meet once more.</i>

1140
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:55,309
Now, go.

1141
01:20:57,052 --> 01:20:58,383
Go, Ethan.

1142
01:21:00,622 --> 01:21:02,385
<i>And don't look back.</i>

1143
01:21:30,819 --> 01:21:32,446
Good luck, Ethan.

1144
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:38,890
And so he rode away
on his horse.

1145
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:41,721
Just like he rode
into my life on one.

1146
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:44,829
Right straight down
that hill.

1147
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,391
Well, where there
used to be a hill.

1148
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:51,903
He rode down it
into greatness
and glory. Yeah.

1149
01:21:52,874 --> 01:21:56,241
The other man in my life
turned out pretty well, too.

1150
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:58,670
Poor old Steely.

1151
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:02,746
I guess I must be
the only person
in the whole world

1152
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:04,785
who really
remembers him.

1153
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:11,487
He died the same year
as Ethan, in 1906,
in the San Francisco fire.

1154
01:22:13,028 --> 01:22:17,431
He died the way
he always lived.
Helping other people.

1155
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:21,796
Help me down
the steps, girl.

1156
01:22:23,805 --> 01:22:26,774
I get a bit creaky
at night, it seems.

1157
01:22:29,844 --> 01:22:31,311
Do you mind
if I say something?

1158
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:33,313
No. Speak ahead, girl.

1159
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:39,811
I think the wrong person
is on that horse
in the square.

1160
01:22:41,156 --> 01:22:42,885
It ought to be you.

1161
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:46,655
Oh. Nonsense!

1162
01:22:47,028 --> 01:22:51,795
<i>Girl, I'm nobody.
Just an old lady
who talks too much.</i>

1163
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:55,059
Fum-de-diddle.
What was I saying now?

1164
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:57,862
Mmm... Oh, yes.

1165
01:22:57,939 --> 01:23:03,343
I wanted you to know how
men like Ethan climb a long,
hard road to greatness.

1166
01:23:03,945 --> 01:23:08,006
They need help, mind you,
and then all of a sudden,
there they are.

1167
01:23:08,249 --> 01:23:10,217
Up there on their own.

1168
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:14,051
<i>You see, Ethan's light
never went out again.</i>

1169
01:23:14,789 --> 01:23:18,657
He used it like a torch
against all the dark,
unscrupulous things

1170
01:23:18,727 --> 01:23:21,423
that men like Dawson
and Frisbee do.

1171
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:25,028
He used it like a beacon
to give men hope,

1172
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:27,867
men building
a place of their own.

1173
01:23:28,503 --> 01:23:34,135
Hoyt City and
a thousand other places
all over the 48 states.

1174
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:37,810
<i>Yes. That's what
he did, girl.</i>

1175
01:23:41,816 --> 01:23:43,784
And he did it
all alone.

1176
01:23:58,533 --> 01:23:59,659
Taxi!

1177
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:10,471
I never saw him again
until he came back home
to die in 1906.

1178
01:24:11,946 --> 01:24:15,780
Then he was all alone
again in the world,
like I was,

1179
01:24:16,985 --> 01:24:21,115
and he came back here
to die,
a bright spring day.

1180
01:24:21,356 --> 01:24:27,818
<i>His truth is marching on</i>

1181
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:35,569
<i>Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!</i>

1182
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:43,677
<i>Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!</i>

1183
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:51,852
<i>Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!</i>

1184
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:59,226
<i>His truth is marching on</i>

1185
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:07,362
<i>Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!</i>

1186
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:10,063
Come out of that.

1187
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:13,669
<i>Haven't the likes
of you newspaper cubs
any shame at all?</i>

1188
01:25:13,741 --> 01:25:15,675
Oh, let me go, Murphy.
I want the news.

1189
01:25:15,743 --> 01:25:18,576
<i>Is the senator dead?
What's he doing
in Hannah Sempler's house?</i>

1190
01:25:18,646 --> 01:25:20,841
The public must know.
I want to get
at the bottom of things.

1191
01:25:20,915 --> 01:25:23,907
<i>The bottom of it, is it?
Sure, and I'll be glad
to help you along.</i>

1192
01:25:23,985 --> 01:25:26,112
Come on,
get along with you.

1193
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:30,413
And let a great gentleman
die in his own proper time
as he likes.

1194
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:35,656
Hannah.

1195
01:25:37,532 --> 01:25:38,897
<i>How'd I do?</i>

1196
01:25:39,234 --> 01:25:42,465
Fine, Ethan. Fine.

1197
01:25:45,673 --> 01:25:47,664
You gave me
the strength.

1198
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:50,235
And the courage.

1199
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:00,647
But you did it
alone, Ethan.

1200
01:26:01,422 --> 01:26:02,684
All alone.

1201
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:06,792
No, Hannah.
Not alone.

1202
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:12,898
You were with me
every step of the way.

1203
01:26:14,636 --> 01:26:15,694
I...

1204
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:19,468
I wanted you to
be proud of me.

1205
01:26:21,142 --> 01:26:23,133
I am proud of you, Ethan.

1206
01:26:24,646 --> 01:26:28,878
Prouder than a cat
with a dozen kittens.

1207
01:26:32,554 --> 01:26:33,748
Hannah?

1208
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,054
Yes, Ethan.

1209
01:26:38,059 --> 01:26:39,720
Come closer, girl.

1210
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:07,417
Just...
Just one thing more.

1211
01:27:11,593 --> 01:27:12,787
A kiss.

1212
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:36,950
And now, there he is.
Up there on his horse.

1213
01:27:40,154 --> 01:27:42,918
And nobody is ever
going to change it.

1214
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:46,082
He stirs the heart
like a challenge.

1215
01:27:46,361 --> 01:27:49,819
<i>That's it.
That's what
he always did.</i>

1216
01:27:51,566 --> 01:27:54,467
Wherever
there were people
trampled by life,

1217
01:27:55,203 --> 01:27:59,037
wherever men
wanted to rise up in all
the bright glory of hope,

1218
01:28:00,308 --> 01:28:01,969
he lifted them up.

1219
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:08,004
He still does.
He always will.

1220
01:28:16,257 --> 01:28:18,919
I...

1221
01:28:21,095 --> 01:28:24,963
<i>I'm kissing
my biography goodbye.</i>

1222
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:32,268
Now run along.

1223
01:28:33,274 --> 01:28:35,970
<i>You've got 100 years
of your own to live,</i>

1224
01:28:37,011 --> 01:28:38,410
if you can take it.

1225
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:40,879
<i>But I'd better
help you home.</i>

1226
01:28:41,015 --> 01:28:45,816
<i>Oh, listen, girl, I've been
getting home on my own
since Abe Lincoln died.</i>

1227
01:28:46,721 --> 01:28:49,815
But thank you
just the same.

1228
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:52,490
Run along.

1229
01:29:40,508 --> 01:29:42,032
Forever, Ethan.

1230
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:46,203
Now no one can change it.

1231
01:29:49,083 --> 01:29:50,311
Forever.
