1
00:03:24,857 --> 00:03:27,226
Horse run trash
like that over by accident...

2
00:03:27,315 --> 00:03:28,689
there ain't a white man on earth...

3
00:03:28,773 --> 00:03:31,557
gonna stand up against roping us up,
now is there?

4
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:35,557
- John Brown would have.
- Come the fuck from over there, now.

5
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:39,510
- Sheriff got a kid?
- And a wife.

6
00:03:39,604 --> 00:03:42,270
I sold him the plot
they built their house on.

7
00:03:46,478 --> 00:03:47,674
Jesus.

8
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,299
Mrs Bullock!

9
00:04:13,431 --> 00:04:17,471
Put that tub of guts on the sled.
Take him to Joanie Stubbs!

10
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,631
Every day since I've been in this camp...

11
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,836
white folks shot
and stabbing on each other...

12
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:31,676
still walking around to do their business.

13
00:04:31,761 --> 00:04:33,218
Maybe we could, too.

14
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:36,667
Now, the onliest violence we meant...

15
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:41,340
was to that stallion's prick
and then to turn an honest dollar.

16
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:52,539
- Closed!
- Well, when you re-the-fuck-open...

17
00:04:52,632 --> 00:04:55,878
note Jane Cannary
extending stay in camp...

18
00:04:55,964 --> 00:04:57,836
asking you to turn out her horse.

19
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,545
I'll note it down.

20
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,332
- Short Nigger General in there?
- No!

21
00:05:03,754 --> 00:05:06,954
How about that stud
he brought into camp...

22
00:05:07,212 --> 00:05:09,914
with his cock hanging past his hocks?

23
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:12,203
He ain't here.

24
00:05:12,503 --> 00:05:14,907
Congratulations being closed!

25
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,827
There goes no one associating me
with that horse.

26
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:28,663
I ain't begging them for mercy.
I hadn't ought have to do that.

27
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:38,745
- Jesus Christ, Hostetler.
- It's my fucking choice.

28
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:40,537
I ain't begged, and I ain't starting.

29
00:05:40,622 --> 00:05:44,864
Now, I'm gonna break your fucking arm
if you don't let go of that gun!

30
00:05:45,121 --> 00:05:47,740
Let's ride for six hours, Hostetler.

31
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:50,945
Ain't no harm in that.
You won't have to beg me once.

32
00:05:51,037 --> 00:05:54,366
Hell, if you still want to do it,
I'll shoot you.

33
00:05:54,994 --> 00:05:57,317
If it come to that, I'd do it myself.

34
00:05:57,661 --> 00:06:01,700
He's definitely alive
'cause being lifted into the cabin...

35
00:06:01,785 --> 00:06:04,984
he give a moan out
and blood come from his mouth.

36
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:08,986
- I told you the state of affairs.
- As of 15 minutes ago.

37
00:06:09,075 --> 00:06:12,156
Run back to the doc's cabin, Johnny!
See the boy again.

38
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:13,271
Shut up.

39
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:15,984
Maybe since you saw him,
he's changed...

40
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:18,740
or the half his chest stove-in
may have healed.

41
00:06:18,823 --> 00:06:22,686
- Or his poor broken head.
- Shut up or I'll throw you out.

42
00:06:25,114 --> 00:06:28,692
Sign these documents
and leave unharmed.

43
00:06:29,613 --> 00:06:33,688
I can't trust that, Mr Swearengen,
being that it's not to your interests.

44
00:06:33,778 --> 00:06:35,235
That applies to you most...

45
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,187
fucking sitting in that chair,
distracting my fucking thinking.

46
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:41,228
If I have to come over there,
I'll cut your fucking throat for you...

47
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,475
pen yet put to paper, or not.

48
00:06:52,108 --> 00:06:54,264
Half-smart fucking cunt.

49
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:00,227
- Bring me Adams' fucking shadow.
- Fucking Hawkeye.

50
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,178
- That poor boy.
- What do you want?

51
00:07:06,897 --> 00:07:10,641
The Sheriff's tragic preoccupation
is also inopportune.

52
00:07:11,646 --> 00:07:13,802
Commissioner Jarry
returns to Deadwood.

53
00:07:14,104 --> 00:07:15,561
How do you know?

54
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,596
Believing that Blasanov
had borrowed my acacia gum...

55
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:21,807
and as Blasanov
was no longer present...

56
00:07:21,894 --> 00:07:23,801
as I canvassed his desk
for the missing gum...

57
00:07:23,894 --> 00:07:26,014
I came across the information
by accident.

58
00:07:26,102 --> 00:07:27,891
- Telegram from Jarry.
- From Crook City.

59
00:07:27,976 --> 00:07:30,013
- To whose attention?
- To the separate attentions...

60
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:32,340
of Messieurs Wolcott and Tolliver.

61
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,009
Ironic, Al, isn't it...

62
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,884
that having turned my newspaper
to partisan purpose...

63
00:07:36,975 --> 00:07:40,007
and in the name of the camp's welfare,
within the day...

64
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:44,637
in the name of that good,
I progress to betraying without regret...

65
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,420
the sanctity of private communications?

66
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:48,544
Oh, well.

67
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,797
We come to know the truth of our
actions only in the protractions of time.

68
00:07:52,888 --> 00:07:56,383
- When's the cocksucker arrive?
- Next coach, his message said.

69
00:07:56,971 --> 00:08:01,046
Unless he's being of aid to Bullock,
bring the Jew up here, too.

70
00:08:01,136 --> 00:08:03,210
Do you think the rumours we floated
in The Pioneer...

71
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:04,760
are what prompt
the commissioner's return?

72
00:08:04,844 --> 00:08:05,874
Yes.

73
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:09,250
And that wishing to pre-empt
Montana and Wyoming...

74
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:12,134
he means to secure us
for Yankton and Dakota.

75
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:14,706
And to sweeten the deal we'll strike...

76
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,833
these interests we've fabricated
must be given face.

77
00:08:17,925 --> 00:08:21,704
And thus,
the uncharted journey continues.

78
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:23,499
Merrick, please.

79
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,960
As we'll be more often
in each other's company...

80
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:29,662
when given to utterance of that type,
consider drinking.

81
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:38,372
They congregate
outside Cochran's cabin.

82
00:08:39,712 --> 00:08:42,200
They've taken the child there.

83
00:08:45,045 --> 00:08:46,869
Well, I wish him well.

84
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,204
Shit!

85
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:57,874
Where's Hawkeye?

86
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,743
I see, Dan, with the world off its axis...

87
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,373
I'm no more to you than a room clerk.

88
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,863
Hawkeye, E.B.,
is he here or fucking not?

89
00:09:04,957 --> 00:09:06,782
Not. For three days.

90
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:10,991
Will you have a shine?
Leave your shoes while you eat.

91
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:13,995
You see Hawkeye,
you grab him and bring him to me.

92
00:09:14,914 --> 00:09:17,828
If you'll leave your dirty clothes,
I'll see to them.

93
00:09:18,788 --> 00:09:22,863
- Did you fucking hear me? Hawkeye!
- Yes.

94
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,786
A broken heart does not impair hearing!

95
00:09:31,286 --> 00:09:33,856
Did they get that fat bastard
to Joanie's?

96
00:09:33,952 --> 00:09:36,487
Did her ladyship take him in?

97
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,487
Ain't towed him halfway yet, boss,
Leon and Con.

98
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:42,106
We got to get a better sled.

99
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,569
Less the sled's hold-up than Con's.

100
00:09:45,158 --> 00:09:47,195
Says he threw a rupture.

101
00:09:50,782 --> 00:09:53,317
You go back to that fucking circus act...

102
00:09:53,531 --> 00:09:55,687
and tell him to get Mose Manuel
to Joanie's...

103
00:09:55,781 --> 00:09:58,861
or a rupture won't be a tickle
to the pain I'll throw at him later.

104
00:10:04,862 --> 00:10:07,978
- Commissioner.
- Where will I find Sheriff Bullock?

105
00:10:08,445 --> 00:10:11,892
His boy had an accident.
He's with him at the doc's.

106
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,186
- Where is the doc's?
- Oh, don't be a fool.

107
00:10:15,527 --> 00:10:18,690
Yankton's interests force imposition
on Bullock's privacy...

108
00:10:18,776 --> 00:10:20,352
as I think, Mr Wolcott,
do your employer's.

109
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:23,890
You'll get a pistol-whipping
and not learn a fucking thing.

110
00:10:23,984 --> 00:10:27,893
These injuries mortal
to earn such commendable deference?

111
00:10:27,983 --> 00:10:29,807
Mortal's how I'd be betting.

112
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:33,892
Of course that casts a different light.
Very sad for the Sheriff and his son.

113
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,642
Can that paper man be made sensible?

114
00:10:37,731 --> 00:10:41,889
The article's a plant from Swearengen,
if that's what you'd want to ask Merrick.

115
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,682
That's the beginning
of what I want to ask.

116
00:10:44,855 --> 00:10:46,395
Don't take much,
does it, Commissioner...

117
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,268
to get your balls tucked up?

118
00:10:48,354 --> 00:10:51,470
They are very sensitive
to changes in weather.

119
00:10:51,895 --> 00:10:53,885
You feel one coming on?

120
00:10:59,102 --> 00:11:01,768
I am a sinner
who does not expect forgiveness.

121
00:11:02,684 --> 00:11:04,721
But I am not a government official.

122
00:11:28,013 --> 00:11:31,378
- AI wants to see you at the Gem.
- When I can.

123
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,626
- No, he didn't say nothing about...
- I'm saying.

124
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,464
- You're saying what?
- When I can.

125
00:11:38,636 --> 00:11:40,543
Are you getting fucking smart with me?

126
00:11:40,635 --> 00:11:41,832
'Cause I'll lift you up in the air...

127
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:43,549
and carry you before
the whole goddamn camp...

128
00:11:43,635 --> 00:11:46,301
like a fucking turtle
with its legs wiggling.

129
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,880
You go on and wait. Hey! Hey, Adams.

130
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:05,459
- Where's Hawkeye?
- I don't know. What did he do?

131
00:12:05,547 --> 00:12:07,786
- AI's looking for him.
- For what?

132
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,337
You're about to take
a goddamn beating...

133
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:12,502
for every fucking time I've been asked,
"What for?" already today.

134
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,416
Any chance Al wanted Hawkeye
to ask him where I was?

135
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,290
I got to take a shit.

136
00:12:20,378 --> 00:12:22,368
- Put it off.
- Won't be put off.

137
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,783
Besides, it ain't the kind
that takes that long.

138
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,499
I'm waiting.
I ain't going back empty-handed.

139
00:12:26,585 --> 00:12:28,658
Fine, fuck it. Just keep your distance.

140
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,247
Just 'cause I'm looking for a bottle...

141
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:35,248
I might have misplaced
during my drinking days...

142
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,743
does not mean if I find a bottle...

143
00:12:42,332 --> 00:12:44,902
that I'm going to fucking drink it.

144
00:12:46,206 --> 00:12:47,698
Jesus Christ!

145
00:12:50,622 --> 00:12:54,069
You... You know whose horse it was?

146
00:12:57,037 --> 00:12:59,193
"Whose horse it was," what?

147
00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:33,486
- You don't bandage him.
- Mr Bullock...

148
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:38,315
your frame or mine couldn't withstand
a stampeding like that...

149
00:13:38,404 --> 00:13:42,065
never mind the unstable one of a boy
of William's years.

150
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:46,100
Further, his brain has been hurt
to an extent...

151
00:13:46,194 --> 00:13:49,357
indicated by the loss
of control of his eyes.

152
00:13:49,444 --> 00:13:52,394
His eye movements
are no longer coordinated.

153
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,561
Might it be of some comfort,
his mother talking to him...

154
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:05,764
for him to hear her voice?

155
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,057
It might well.

156
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:15,222
His father's, too.

157
00:14:32,643 --> 00:14:37,762
Tell your wife that it won't hurt him
to put a cloth to his brow.

158
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:46,639
Just stand there?

159
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:49,634
No, build yourself a fucking shrine.

160
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,674
No, I mean, should I knock
and let Doc know I'm there...

161
00:14:52,765 --> 00:14:54,968
and then stand the fuck outside?

162
00:14:55,431 --> 00:14:58,712
- Yeah, do that.
- Thanks, Trixie.

163
00:15:01,554 --> 00:15:04,338
The cocksucker upstairs
sends his retriever out to collect me...

164
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:06,384
with instructions
I'm to wait till summoned.

165
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,212
I suppose then
you should sit the fuck down.

166
00:15:08,303 --> 00:15:09,879
And I come, too...

167
00:15:09,969 --> 00:15:13,251
and find you like you never left
this place to learn your numbers.

168
00:15:13,344 --> 00:15:15,879
Did you teaching me make me
accountable for my whereabouts...

169
00:15:15,968 --> 00:15:17,212
the rest of my fucking days?

170
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:19,126
If he wants me,
he can fucking come find me.

171
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,959
Why not wait
and find out what he wants?

172
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:22,757
Why don't you tell me yourself?

173
00:15:22,842 --> 00:15:26,787
- Because I don't know that, Mr Star.
- Other events have a claim to attention.

174
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:28,423
He knows about other events.

175
00:15:28,508 --> 00:15:31,789
- Ain't you his fucking lapdog, Trixie?
- I ain't nobody's fucking lapdog.

176
00:15:31,882 --> 00:15:33,588
Hard to think even of you
coming to learn numbers...

177
00:15:33,673 --> 00:15:35,829
without its being to his purpose.

178
00:15:36,214 --> 00:15:38,916
Any more to that fucking thought?

179
00:15:42,338 --> 00:15:44,210
I'll have a fucking drink.

180
00:15:44,296 --> 00:15:47,459
Have the horse's piss.
It's on fucking special.

181
00:15:49,004 --> 00:15:52,748
If you couldn't be of use,
he wouldn't have sent for you.

182
00:15:57,252 --> 00:15:59,538
I wish I could help you more.

183
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,119
I've been walking for two hours.

184
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:04,993
I'm starting to think
that place is a fucking mirage.

185
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:12,039
Let me take a turn.

186
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,578
Maybe I better not.

187
00:16:19,164 --> 00:16:21,996
- He asked to see Hawkeye first.
- This is Adams!

188
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,201
I know who the fuck it is!

189
00:16:24,622 --> 00:16:27,453
So just shut the fuck up and sit down.

190
00:16:36,244 --> 00:16:39,988
How do you lay claim
to a passable mind while ignoring...

191
00:16:40,077 --> 00:16:44,283
if I'd wanted to do you in, my inviting
the Sheriff up here to witness?

192
00:16:44,368 --> 00:16:47,946
By not putting it beyond your
own mind's quality, Mr Swearengen...

193
00:16:48,034 --> 00:16:50,107
to have enacted the incident
in the thoroughfare...

194
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,356
which then drew the Sheriff away.

195
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:03,066
Have you come to murder me, Silas?

196
00:17:05,072 --> 00:17:07,062
I wouldn't turn down the chance.

197
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:35,685
Even swayed at last by my manly
composure, you sign in a false hand.

198
00:17:37,316 --> 00:17:39,804
Mightn't this be my true hand...

199
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:42,849
and my hand to the hotel register, false?

200
00:18:09,976 --> 00:18:12,050
Wish I had five like you.

201
00:18:27,598 --> 00:18:29,718
I expect that puts you up.

202
00:18:46,136 --> 00:18:49,133
Last thing required
at a child's sickbed...

203
00:18:49,218 --> 00:18:52,797
unlubricated drunk,
sweating and fucking vomiting.

204
00:18:53,176 --> 00:18:55,842
And I ain't one for blood, is my worry.

205
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:05,162
I may be worse hurting than him.

206
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,040
In whose keeping
would the horse have been?

207
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:17,080
Whose oversight would have let him
loose and not have seen him pursued?

208
00:19:17,213 --> 00:19:20,412
Every answer lay at the livery.

209
00:19:20,712 --> 00:19:24,408
I propose we put in towards
a white satin comforter...

210
00:19:24,503 --> 00:19:27,335
to be presented to
the injured boy's mother.

211
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:31,199
"Back in three hours,"
scrawled in nigger...

212
00:19:31,294 --> 00:19:33,698
on a sign pinned to the door.

213
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:39,452
I wish I'd have caught them leaving.

214
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,743
Torn-up fucking back and all.

215
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:48,904
Wish I'd have seen them run,
the pure fucking niggerness of it.

216
00:19:49,082 --> 00:19:50,574
Here's Tom.

217
00:20:02,746 --> 00:20:05,150
Take that fucking thing outside.

218
00:20:06,787 --> 00:20:09,950
Outside with it,
leaned somewhere out of sight.

219
00:20:26,949 --> 00:20:31,191
On behalf of all of us,
just to say we're sorry.

220
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:34,062
Thank you.

221
00:20:34,156 --> 00:20:37,687
Tom Nuttall
bears no more responsibility...

222
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:40,150
in any fucking way...

223
00:20:41,488 --> 00:20:45,232
to the hurt,
to the Sheriff's boy than I do...

224
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:49,978
as an innocent,
fucking, helpful bystander!

225
00:20:51,111 --> 00:20:53,481
Jungle fucking niggers!

226
00:20:57,068 --> 00:21:01,725
Before his present troubles and whilst
you pursued your preferred activities...

227
00:21:01,818 --> 00:21:02,931
your partner Bullock...

228
00:21:03,026 --> 00:21:06,437
joined in a campaign
to which I hope you will now subscribe.

229
00:21:06,525 --> 00:21:09,143
What do you mean
"my preferred activities"?

230
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:12,479
A reference to your people's penchant
for money-getting.

231
00:21:12,565 --> 00:21:13,809
A poor attempt at wit.

232
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:16,351
- I don't find those funny.
- I apologise.

233
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,347
If you want my help, don't insult me.

234
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:21,390
Jesus Christ, show me
the secret grip that proves my regret...

235
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,471
and let's be about our fucking business.

236
00:21:23,563 --> 00:21:28,303
Will you salt Adams
with expertise about Helena's politics...

237
00:21:28,396 --> 00:21:31,642
and Butte's,
to be taken by this cunt commissioner...

238
00:21:31,728 --> 00:21:33,802
as samplings of a vein of familiarity...

239
00:21:33,895 --> 00:21:37,509
so rich, wide and deep, as to leave
this commissioner in no doubt...

240
00:21:37,602 --> 00:21:40,802
that Montana, stiff-pricked,
courted Adams...

241
00:21:41,102 --> 00:21:44,467
as Deadwood's representative,
so strenuously towards annexation...

242
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,054
it forced him to flee,
lest he say, "Yes, yes, take us now."

243
00:21:48,142 --> 00:21:50,808
And yield the virtue of the camp
on the spot?

244
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,755
Yeah, I'll school him.

245
00:22:22,177 --> 00:22:24,795
Does William Bullock
continue unchanged?

246
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:29,292
As to Ellsworth's proposal of marriage,
which way do you incline?

247
00:22:29,592 --> 00:22:31,878
Do you take us in
from on high then, Trixie...

248
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:34,964
- and are you privy to all our secrets?
- Which way?

249
00:22:36,674 --> 00:22:41,046
The prospect of Ellsworth,
in the role of father, delights me.

250
00:22:41,132 --> 00:22:45,622
If it's fucking him gives you pause,
he'd never make you.

251
00:22:45,714 --> 00:22:49,659
What gives me pause,
having had the experience...

252
00:22:49,963 --> 00:22:52,914
is the prospect of marriage without love.

253
00:22:53,088 --> 00:22:56,997
Yeah, but when it came to cases,
you took that fucking leap.

254
00:22:57,878 --> 00:23:00,117
Ellsworth waits on your answer.

255
00:23:01,961 --> 00:23:04,579
Whatever you await before giving it.

256
00:23:10,584 --> 00:23:11,958
Bye-bye.

257
00:23:24,456 --> 00:23:26,861
Names and places, Star, as instructed...

258
00:23:26,956 --> 00:23:29,325
leaving it to us as to their deployment.

259
00:23:29,414 --> 00:23:31,819
Butte's got Montana's gold.

260
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:36,536
Being territorial seat,
Helena might well romance us...

261
00:23:36,621 --> 00:23:38,694
for balance against Butte.

262
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,530
Clark and Daly are the two
strongest men in the territory.

263
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:45,993
Both from Butte?

264
00:23:46,285 --> 00:23:47,991
Both from gold exclusive?

265
00:23:48,202 --> 00:23:51,981
Clark started in mercantile,
but he's strong in gold now.

266
00:23:52,743 --> 00:23:56,736
- Any chance they might combine?
- No. They fucking hate each other!

267
00:23:56,825 --> 00:23:58,483
Who's the later arrival?

268
00:23:58,575 --> 00:24:02,235
Daly, from Salt Lake,
with Comstock money behind him.

269
00:24:02,324 --> 00:24:05,654
Backed with Comstock money, you'd
consider his connection to Hearst?

270
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,145
What do we know of Clark's ways?

271
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:12,437
- Clark or Daly?
- Clark, Star! We can't chance Daly.

272
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,065
I don't know Clark's ways
or Daly's, either.

273
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:17,228
I'm not from fucking Butte, remember?

274
00:24:17,321 --> 00:24:19,774
I wonder if Clark's ever been to Helena.

275
00:24:19,862 --> 00:24:24,151
Yeah, he's been to Helena.
I fucking ate with him once, all right?

276
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:31,310
Don't tell me you might recall
what type appetite he exhibited...

277
00:24:31,402 --> 00:24:32,894
or his preference as to food.

278
00:24:32,985 --> 00:24:36,184
Don't tell me we might be
fucking getting somewhere.

279
00:24:36,526 --> 00:24:37,556
All right.

280
00:24:44,732 --> 00:24:47,516
- Murder me, someone!
- Quiet.

281
00:25:23,933 --> 00:25:28,589
We slide these under the sled,
lever the cocksucker vertical...

282
00:25:28,682 --> 00:25:32,177
tilt him further forward
and drop him on the sofa.

283
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:36,128
Why not just run at him
from across the room...

284
00:25:36,556 --> 00:25:39,091
and stab him with all three pitchforks?

285
00:25:41,596 --> 00:25:45,175
- Ain't you gonna cut?
- I have other patients.

286
00:25:45,262 --> 00:25:50,084
I choose not to undertake a futile
and exhaustive procedure.

287
00:25:51,261 --> 00:25:56,048
Guessing through the fat where
his heart is, bullet's lodged too close.

288
00:25:57,385 --> 00:25:59,754
I'm still in fucking discomfort, Doc.

289
00:26:00,718 --> 00:26:02,791
Nurse him, he's herniated.

290
00:26:11,174 --> 00:26:13,840
He's the cardsharp told me about Bill.

291
00:26:13,923 --> 00:26:18,414
I'd punch that cocksucker in the balls,
before I'd cup them for comfort.

292
00:26:21,838 --> 00:26:23,912
All right, slim.

293
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,410
- Hey, Joanie?
- No chance, Leon.

294
00:26:43,251 --> 00:26:47,196
The doctor says that the cloth
to his brow may comfort William.

295
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:50,700
And being spoken to.

296
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:58,039
If I had kept him in Michigan...

297
00:27:05,372 --> 00:27:06,402
Yes.

298
00:27:08,704 --> 00:27:10,778
I want to take him home.

299
00:27:12,995 --> 00:27:15,364
Doc says better he's not moved.

300
00:27:17,494 --> 00:27:19,449
There's no better about it.

301
00:27:23,868 --> 00:27:25,147
Is there?

302
00:27:36,491 --> 00:27:39,109
What does the doctor tell us to say?

303
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:54,987
Mr Merrick, might we have a word?

304
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:58,435
You and I, Commissioner Jarry,
have nothing whatever to discuss!

305
00:27:58,528 --> 00:28:00,518
Seek your conversations elsewhere!

306
00:28:17,982 --> 00:28:21,561
I hope that will achieve
what the party adjoining us intends.

307
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,934
Thank you.

308
00:28:25,106 --> 00:28:27,890
- So what the fuck do you want with us?
- Shut up.

309
00:28:27,981 --> 00:28:30,647
I hope that even in the gravest
of outcomes...

310
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:34,805
the Sheriff's crisis could produce
the blessing of our reconciliation.

311
00:28:34,938 --> 00:28:37,342
- I'm listening.
- Well, then shame the fuck on you!

312
00:28:37,437 --> 00:28:40,719
Gentlemen, we are men of experience.

313
00:28:41,228 --> 00:28:45,884
Self-interest is immutable,
but its dictates vary daily.

314
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:48,720
You talk like you take it up the ass.

315
00:28:48,976 --> 00:28:51,927
I do not, my friend Adams,
take it up the ass.

316
00:28:52,018 --> 00:28:53,640
Don't call me your fucking friend!

317
00:28:53,726 --> 00:28:58,346
But I suspect those that do, consider
that they advance their own interests.

318
00:28:58,433 --> 00:29:02,639
Like them, shall we not pursue
that which gratifies us mutually?

319
00:29:02,724 --> 00:29:04,051
If you'd calm the fuck down.

320
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,924
I'm the one he insulted.
I've got pride, if you fucking don't.

321
00:29:07,015 --> 00:29:09,218
I've got pride,
I just know when to fucking swallow it.

322
00:29:09,306 --> 00:29:10,549
Maybe you take it up the ass!

323
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:13,305
Jesus fucking Christ,
must I make you leave the room?

324
00:29:13,388 --> 00:29:14,418
Gentlemen.

325
00:29:20,304 --> 00:29:21,926
Tell him what Bullock had you doing.

326
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:28,083
Tell him what you were doing...

327
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:30,176
in Montana.

328
00:30:16,376 --> 00:30:20,037
Any turn here,
come get me at the Chez Ami.

329
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:23,656
- Sure, Doc.
- I'm gonna be operating on a whale.

330
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,329
It strains credulity.

331
00:30:36,331 --> 00:30:37,906
The imagination balks.

332
00:30:37,997 --> 00:30:40,663
I sit here, right,
and he calls me a fucking liar?

333
00:30:40,746 --> 00:30:43,151
No one is calling you a liar, Mr Adams.

334
00:30:43,246 --> 00:30:45,947
In fact, I'm sure even you
would agree, the idea...

335
00:30:46,037 --> 00:30:49,283
of a man conducting the business
of his territory...

336
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:52,486
- from the back room of a restaurant...
- The Stonehouse!

337
00:30:53,202 --> 00:30:54,481
The Stonehouse...

338
00:30:54,577 --> 00:30:57,491
offering a bounty
for the allegiance of others...

339
00:30:57,576 --> 00:30:59,780
while wearing a bag over his head.

340
00:30:59,868 --> 00:31:02,735
I won't pretend
it didn't strike me strange.

341
00:31:02,825 --> 00:31:07,067
Maintaining anonymity, clearly,
while forming an impression of Adams.

342
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:11,189
The mind imagines
other paths to the purpose.

343
00:31:11,282 --> 00:31:14,896
I'm giving less and less a fuck
of what you strain and balk at, too.

344
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:18,022
Apart from what the bag
bespeaks of the wearer...

345
00:31:18,114 --> 00:31:21,396
what concerns me
is their offer for your support.

346
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:24,860
Ask me what ought to concern us,
is the offer fucking real?

347
00:31:24,946 --> 00:31:28,856
We turn the camp toward Montana,
$50,000 ain't unreasonable.

348
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,192
Though anyone can bandy numbers.

349
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:34,145
What's unreasonable
is fucking Bullock's quote on his cut.

350
00:31:34,236 --> 00:31:39,106
Clark would have the 50, but was
the man really speaking for Clark?

351
00:31:39,651 --> 00:31:41,938
Consider another alternative.

352
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:44,852
What if it was Clark who was speaking?

353
00:31:48,608 --> 00:31:52,815
Why would a representative of Clark,
unknown to Adams...

354
00:31:52,899 --> 00:31:55,565
therefore unrecognisable,
never to meet him again...

355
00:31:55,648 --> 00:32:00,186
- conceal his identity beneath a bag?
- Maybe he had open sores.

356
00:32:00,772 --> 00:32:04,019
Clark knew you would be able
to recognise him from photographs...

357
00:32:04,105 --> 00:32:07,351
or at least it was a risk
he might not want to take.

358
00:32:13,978 --> 00:32:15,257
Anyways.

359
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:20,391
If Deadwood could grant an interval
before answering Montana's offer...

360
00:32:20,477 --> 00:32:25,429
I will convey my impressions to Yankton
and learn whether they wish to counter.

361
00:32:25,684 --> 00:32:29,428
I have no objection.
Though I speak only for myself.

362
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,593
Mr Swearengen, you are far too modest.

363
00:32:35,516 --> 00:32:37,056
Gentlemen.

364
00:32:47,055 --> 00:32:48,512
What just happened?

365
00:32:49,388 --> 00:32:54,258
We knocked the cocksucker up.
And soon he will find himself delivering.

366
00:32:54,345 --> 00:32:56,252
- The 50?
- Elections.

367
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:06,084
- I wonder how that boy is doing.
- Ain't my department.

368
00:33:11,592 --> 00:33:14,459
You could put yourself to more distance.

369
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,496
I'm scared to go off in the dark.

370
00:33:18,382 --> 00:33:20,372
I can't piss when I'm scared.

371
00:33:24,631 --> 00:33:26,917
What about Oregon, Hostetler?

372
00:33:28,547 --> 00:33:30,372
You could be my apprentice.

373
00:33:31,588 --> 00:33:35,000
Carry love notes
from pot-gut shitheads...

374
00:33:35,087 --> 00:33:38,417
to those fat-ass women
that they keep on the side.

375
00:33:43,794 --> 00:33:47,573
I'm gonna catch that son of a bitch
and take him back to camp.

376
00:33:49,584 --> 00:33:52,203
That could bring about some killing.

377
00:33:52,917 --> 00:33:56,199
Kill the horse, that's on them.
I guess it's their right.

378
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:59,036
But they ain't gonna get to kill me.

379
00:33:59,124 --> 00:34:00,368
'Cause when it comes to them cases...

380
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:02,199
you'll blow your own fucking head off.

381
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,162
And once you've cheated
those white cocksuckers...

382
00:34:04,248 --> 00:34:07,032
won't they just roll around
and gnash their teeth?

383
00:34:07,123 --> 00:34:09,160
What do you mean cheat?

384
00:34:09,622 --> 00:34:11,992
"God damn, Hostetler beat us.

385
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,912
"He done come out victorious
with his fucking head blowed off."

386
00:34:14,996 --> 00:34:18,859
I ain't never cheated
no white cocksucker in my life.

387
00:34:20,245 --> 00:34:22,911
For that matter, no nigger, either.

388
00:34:23,744 --> 00:34:26,363
They ain't hung you yet, Hostetler.

389
00:34:27,327 --> 00:34:29,862
And maybe
they won't even get the chance.

390
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:33,984
But they sure have made you
crazy with pride.

391
00:34:41,658 --> 00:34:44,441
A man that did go back to tell his part...

392
00:34:45,865 --> 00:34:48,732
and brought the horse
that he set loose...

393
00:34:49,115 --> 00:34:51,898
to them that he caused to suffer...

394
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,984
paid respect
for the pain that he couldn't fix.

395
00:34:59,904 --> 00:35:02,771
Now if and it, it happened...

396
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,357
that they forgive him...

397
00:35:07,403 --> 00:35:11,893
so he didn't have to do to hisself
what he wouldn't let be done to him...

398
00:35:14,818 --> 00:35:19,024
well then, I guard,
that man might think...

399
00:35:20,733 --> 00:35:22,107
setting forth afterwards...

400
00:35:22,191 --> 00:35:25,105
with whatever fucking loudmouth
went along with him...

401
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:31,680
that if he made it to Oregon alive...

402
00:35:41,896 --> 00:35:44,514
the two of them might open a livery.

403
00:35:52,394 --> 00:35:54,964
Then let's find that fucking horse.

404
00:36:04,641 --> 00:36:08,421
- Back among friends.
- With what increase in knowledge?

405
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:11,419
Mr Merrick proved reticent...

406
00:36:11,515 --> 00:36:13,505
so I made a call to the Gem Saloon...

407
00:36:13,598 --> 00:36:16,168
where Swearengen
and that young cutthroat, Adams...

408
00:36:16,264 --> 00:36:20,092
Yankton's young cutthroat times past,
if memory don't deceive.

409
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:23,261
Adams, as it happens,
had just returned from Helena.

410
00:36:23,388 --> 00:36:26,220
He was sent there by Swearengen
in order to hear from Montana...

411
00:36:26,304 --> 00:36:28,543
and offer to annex this camp.

412
00:36:28,678 --> 00:36:33,003
It emerges further that, pretensions
to holiness notwithstanding...

413
00:36:33,094 --> 00:36:36,127
your Sheriff Bullock
is the courtship's go-between.

414
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,253
There's all kind of sense in that.

415
00:36:38,343 --> 00:36:39,622
Bullock bedding down
with Swearengen...

416
00:36:39,718 --> 00:36:41,589
being as they just
nearly killed each other.

417
00:36:41,676 --> 00:36:44,626
Might not greed and enmity in Bullock...

418
00:36:44,717 --> 00:36:46,458
be served by passing on
to Swearengen...

419
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,955
an overture beneficial
to Bullock's pocket...

420
00:36:49,049 --> 00:36:52,959
requiring of Swearengen
the demeaning business of filling it?

421
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:56,078
What did
the Helena conversations produce?

422
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:59,620
An offer of $50,000
for Swearengen to back Montana.

423
00:37:00,422 --> 00:37:04,083
He's losing his belly for the grift.
I'd have said they offered 100.

424
00:37:04,172 --> 00:37:07,204
Impossible, certainly,
to know what offer was made...

425
00:37:07,296 --> 00:37:10,791
and if made, would be honoured
by Montana in the act.

426
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:12,454
Will they entertain other offers?

427
00:37:12,545 --> 00:37:16,372
That Swearengen traffics in bribes,
I testify to firsthand.

428
00:37:19,627 --> 00:37:23,951
That your employer is a man of means,
you have amply demonstrated.

429
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:27,198
Swearengen putting himself
up for auction...

430
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:30,704
as he has not hitherto without
the stipulation of local appointments...

431
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:33,326
is the development of consequence.

432
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:37,195
Let the Montana offer be real,
or a fraud of his concoction...

433
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,576
Swearengen is certainly real.

434
00:37:40,581 --> 00:37:45,570
Your employer will have to decide
whether he wants to pay Swearengen...

435
00:37:45,747 --> 00:37:48,579
and not quibble over
his pumping the price.

436
00:37:48,829 --> 00:37:52,574
And let those who are dismayed over
the enlistment of Swearengen...

437
00:37:52,662 --> 00:37:57,117
recall that combat makes comrades,
and be resigned.

438
00:37:58,036 --> 00:38:01,152
Biggest fish I ever seen
landed, Commissioner.

439
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,615
Did I say that resigned enough?

440
00:38:03,702 --> 00:38:06,071
Had Swearengen word of Bullock's boy?

441
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:09,987
It's surprising which comrades
will show up sentimental.

442
00:38:36,987 --> 00:38:41,857
Trixie asked me to thank you for finding
her error in numbers this afternoon.

443
00:38:50,151 --> 00:38:52,935
Ducks have landed
on the Spearfish pond.

444
00:38:55,691 --> 00:38:58,772
Father's eager
to hear you sound your calls.

445
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:05,644
Hear you calling them in.

446
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,591
I'm proud of the calls you've made.

447
00:39:21,686 --> 00:39:25,016
I've much enjoyed
showing you how to make them.

448
00:39:25,394 --> 00:39:27,929
Now you make them better than I do.

449
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:35,256
Thank you for caring for your mother...

450
00:39:37,183 --> 00:39:39,885
at times when I'm away.

451
00:39:41,433 --> 00:39:44,264
It's a comfort to know you are with her.

452
00:39:46,223 --> 00:39:49,919
I am much pleased
now that we all can be together.

453
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,795
I am so much pleased, William.

454
00:39:54,805 --> 00:39:56,428
As is your father.

455
00:40:01,637 --> 00:40:03,177
All the ducks...

456
00:40:05,386 --> 00:40:07,044
and your garden...

457
00:40:08,552 --> 00:40:12,296
helping your mother,
and that we love you.

458
00:40:17,467 --> 00:40:19,292
Rest now, William.

459
00:40:20,633 --> 00:40:23,915
We'll rest and rise together.

460
00:40:33,756 --> 00:40:36,291
Account for yourself, Richardson.

461
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:41,373
I'm praying for the Sheriff's boy.

462
00:40:41,921 --> 00:40:44,325
To the god of antlers and hooves?

463
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:47,583
It protected Mrs Garret
when she walked alone at night.

464
00:40:49,794 --> 00:40:52,827
I'm asking it to bless his journey.

465
00:40:54,002 --> 00:40:57,449
Pray away then, moron,
for all the harm you will do.

466
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,368
But leave off when the guests ascend.

467
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:17,937
Why ain't you among the circumcised?

468
00:42:21,985 --> 00:42:24,473
The day saw advances, Trixie.

469
00:42:26,317 --> 00:42:27,975
None miraculous.

470
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:33,064
Where's the gimp?

471
00:42:35,857 --> 00:42:38,013
On watch outside Cochran's.

472
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,930
Why not stand with her?

473
00:43:08,517 --> 00:43:13,422
Oh, no. Gimp. Can't hold the cup.

474
00:44:26,877 --> 00:44:30,076
The hoof hits just one inch to the right...

475
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:34,078
the boy's pain is gone,
they don't have to watch him suffer.

476
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:37,243
I doubt he's omniscient.

477
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:40,159
I know he's myopic.

478
00:44:40,374 --> 00:44:43,953
Why don't you concentrate
on the fucking task at hand?

479
00:44:45,207 --> 00:44:46,486
Go on.

480
00:44:49,164 --> 00:44:50,538
Hold this.

481
00:44:52,455 --> 00:44:57,028
Now, we may not be able to find
the bullet...

482
00:44:57,121 --> 00:44:59,490
in and amongst the adipose tissue.

483
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:03,074
Or, finding it,
we mayn't be able to remove it.

484
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:07,158
Or, removing it, to avoid killing him.

485
00:45:09,285 --> 00:45:12,899
I guess we could give it a fucking whirl.

486
00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:25,571
My name is Cramed.

487
00:45:25,657 --> 00:45:28,441
I've heard a boy is trampled
and like to die.

488
00:45:28,532 --> 00:45:30,273
You look familiar.

489
00:45:30,364 --> 00:45:33,315
I came last year to hustle dice,
took sick with plague.

490
00:45:33,406 --> 00:45:37,150
- I minister now in Lead.
- How's the new racket pay?

491
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:46,231
Knowing this camp's without a minister,
I come to be on call to the family.

492
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,270
Shall I ask elsewhere
or will you tell me their name?

493
00:45:49,361 --> 00:45:50,640
Bullock.

494
00:45:51,069 --> 00:45:54,564
- Their boy is at Cochran's cabin.
- Thank you.

495
00:45:56,484 --> 00:45:59,814
- $2 a room, if you're staying over.
- I may.

496
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,190
50 cents off for clergy.

497
00:46:02,275 --> 00:46:05,356
$6 extra if they set up
for dice in the room.

498
00:46:08,482 --> 00:46:12,973
Avoid looking left as you exit
if idolatry offends you.

499
00:46:57,431 --> 00:46:59,504
Good evening, Richardson.

500
00:47:01,472 --> 00:47:03,960
I will take the air very briefly.

501
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:09,210
I've left my door ajar indicating my trust
for you, which you've well earned...

502
00:47:09,553 --> 00:47:12,337
in days past, escorting me so reliably.

503
00:47:13,094 --> 00:47:15,464
Will you stand in the hallway above...

504
00:47:15,552 --> 00:47:19,047
so that you may answer
if Sofia wakes and calls out?

505
00:47:23,176 --> 00:47:28,164
"Your mother is just away, Sofia,
very, very soon to return...

506
00:47:28,758 --> 00:47:31,542
- "and all is well."
- Yes, ma'am.

507
00:47:35,965 --> 00:47:40,835
Perhaps without going inside,
as this might frighten her.
