1
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,937
Take a good look at him.
He's the bad guy.

2
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:24,775
And Joe Jarrett--that's me--
and Zack Thomas, we 're the good guys.

3
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:26,485
Let's go!

4
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,924
T ell the driver to stop!
T ell him to surrender.

5
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:54,114
I' m with the railroad. T ell him
I demand he gives up the money.

6
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:58,577
- Our lives are worth more than money!
- Did you mention money?

7
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:02,789
There's $100,000
on this stagecoach.

8
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,793
$100,000? I'm glad
I'm fighting for a worthy cause.

9
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,132
- I hate to waste ammunition.
- You' re not a railroad man, are you?

10
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,468
I' m anybody's man,
mostly my own.

11
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,483
Get ready.

12
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,583
Swing out!
Move up on the outside.

13
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,180
The other window.

14
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:35,466
"T o Jonas Ansel,
for 20 years'...

15
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,926
...unwavering loyalty.

16
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:43,724
Thaddeus Markham, President,
T exas lnterstate Railroad. "

17
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,897
It chimes.

18
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,030
Look out!

19
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,199
Get out of there!

20
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,792
Keep after them!

21
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,266
Hold it!

22
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,311
They're picking us off
like flies.

23
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,985
Whoa up there,
you jugheads! Whoa!

24
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:42,073
Hold on down there.
I'll get them under control.

25
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:48,705
Whoa!

26
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,125
- What about Zack Thomas?
- That's him driving the stage.

27
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:57,965
Burden said to get
Zack Thomas and the money.

28
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:05,805
- So?
- So I was just wondering.

29
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,267
Well, stop wondering.

30
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:16,608
- Anybody else just wondering?
- Nope. Not me, boss.

31
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,154
I' m going back to Galveston.

32
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,080
I'll have this
under control in a minute.

33
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:33,916
Yeah, you do that.

34
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,973
Hang on to your hat, Ansel.
Here we go!

35
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:08,696
They tried to tell me the meek
would inherit the earth.

36
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,287
IKinda awkward, me having
the drop on you, huh?

37
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,874
Hold that!

38
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:31,553
Back off!

39
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:40,354
- Where's the little man in there?
- Ansel? He was took dead.

40
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,607
This can't be his money.
He was so anxious to give it away.

41
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:47,820
- He's just a railroad agent.
- T ransporting for the railroad.

42
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,988
They overcharged me for years.
This can be a rebate.

43
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,618
- He left that as a little remembrance?
- The scarf?

44
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,830
It was his dying wish.
He insisted.

45
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,376
He insisted you take
the watch too?

46
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:08,757
You wouldn't believe it.
That fellow was all heart.

47
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,175
It chimes.

48
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:15,013
Start loading.
Paper money first.

49
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:25,856
Don't pout. Just fill the bag.
Hurry it up.

50
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,569
It's gonna be easy to spend.

51
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,030
Don't forget all the sacks.

52
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,574
The Good Book says:

53
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,787
" Cheaters never prosper.
Square-shooters always win."

54
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,249
Come on. Lay it up here.

55
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:48,422
Change the literature. What you' re
reading ain't doing you good.

56
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,092
They said that before
I burned down the Sunday school.

57
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,054
- Anything else, master?
- Unhitch me a horse.

58
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,766
- Now.
- Yes, sir.

59
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:08,858
Looks like money. Feels like money.
Sounds like money.

60
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:12,154
- It's a lovely sound.
- Pity it ain't all gold.

61
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:15,407
You'd pleasure yourself
to death listening to it.

62
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,076
I figure you got a name, boy.

63
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,788
Thomas. Zachariah Thomas.
And you?

64
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:27,127
- I'll find out sooner or later.
- Jarrett. Joe Jarrett.

65
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:35,259
Well, Joe, I think there's
something you should know.

66
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,389
This ain't railroad money.
It's investment money.

67
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:43,769
You see, there's a man over
in Galveston's got an idea.

68
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,897
So the president of the railroad
financed him.

69
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:51,693
You saying he smooth-talked Markham
out of $100,000?

70
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,278
Yep. Me.

71
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,073
- You?
- Me.

72
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:01,537
- I think I underrated you.
- I think you did, Joe.

73
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:07,876
You' re just slow in catching on.
But I'm beginning to like you, Joe.

74
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:12,088
- I might cut you in.
- Don't talk me out of this loot.

75
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:17,594
- l' m not a soft-hearted president.
- I want to talk you into something.

76
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:23,099
- Now this here's a lot of money.
- Ordinarily $100,000 would be...

77
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:28,312
...enough for two, but not me.
You see, I was born greedy.

78
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:34,403
If my plan works,
we'll get a half a million a year.

79
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,322
- Thank you, Zack.
- Now you wanna buy in?

80
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,825
I'll quit while I'm ahead.

81
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,955
Nothing personal, mind you.
I'm beginning to like you too.

82
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:51,961
A man who tries to con you
with a gun on him can't be bad.

83
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:57,633
Like you just said,
I guess you underrated me, Joe.

84
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,305
I'll tell you why I didn't
go for your proposition, Zack.

85
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:06,018
You don't have the proper
respect for a man's money.

86
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:08,978
I appreciate your
thinking about it.

87
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,063
Zachariah, rest easy.

88
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:15,319
I'm gonna put this here
money to good use.

89
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:20,026
Zachariah, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

90
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,906
I was gonna give you a break.

91
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:28,117
I' m starting to change the rules,
Zachariah.

92
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,914
Why you dirty....
You no-good son of a....

93
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,546
What's the matter?

94
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:57,813
You need a rifle if you wanna
play this game, Joe.

95
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:05,364
Sorry, Joe. I still
can't hear you.

96
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,431
Zack, you' re calling
the rules. What you want?

97
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:36,394
I can hear you better now, Joe.
Throw those guns down.

98
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,357
Both of them.
Yours and mine.

99
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:43,986
Walk to me with your
hands up where I can see them.

100
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:46,362
Both hands.

101
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:58,083
That's right, Joe.
IKeep walking towards me.

102
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,544
That's fine.

103
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:32,200
Hot day for a stroll,
ain't it, Joe?

104
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,871
They tell me them boots
ain't built for walking.

105
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,042
They ain't exactly
house slippers.

106
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:47,007
- I thought you'd never get here.
- I've been thinking it over.

107
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,135
Now, mind you,
l' m not saying yes, but...

108
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:56,141
...you know, I wanna talk about
that business proposition.

109
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,813
Forget it. They don't build riverboats
big enough for the two of us.

110
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,483
Riverboat?

111
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,944
I'm gonna take the horses.

112
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,198
What about me?

113
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:18,663
IKnow what the lnjun said when asked
why he rode and the squaw walked?

114
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,707
He said,
"She got no ' hoss.' "

115
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:27,339
T ake the horses and walk to
the money. I'll be right behind you.

116
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,841
If that's what he said
he was a smart lndian.

117
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:36,473
Start with the guns
and the carpetbag.

118
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:40,185
Why not?
It looks like it's your money.

119
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:49,652
You're agreeable for a man about
to lose $100,000.

120
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,155
Easy come, easy go.

121
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,704
- Sure is hot.
- It's gonna get hotter too.

122
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:04,125
- Along noon, it will be a scorcher.
- For you. Drop it.

123
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:12,466
Come on, Zack. That's it.
Now back off.

124
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,348
You shouldn't play aces
in another man's game.

125
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:23,061
How about those horses?
You can't ride all of them.

126
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:26,939
This is a set
and I wouldn't want to break it up.

127
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:31,528
You were right about those boots.
They ain't made for walking.

128
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,910
And like the lndian said,
"You ain't got no ' hoss. ' "

129
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:41,497
So long, Zachariah.

130
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,623
Careful of sunstroke.

131
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:46,043
It gets hot this time of day.

132
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:48,961
Serves me right for trusting
that miserable....

133
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:38,594
Young ladies
and young gentlemen.

134
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:40,596
One of you is naughty.

135
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:45,060
I felt something hit my,
my... person.

136
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:47,103
I' m going to turn my back...

137
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:50,399
...and I want the owner
of that insidious instrument...

138
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:52,901
...to place it
on the ground behind me.

139
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,945
Remember, young ladies
and gentlemen...

140
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:59,408
...I' m putting
you on your honor.

141
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:13,045
Well, l' m waiting.

142
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,299
We don't have all day.

143
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:49,373
I' m glad to know that
there is honor amongst you.

144
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:53,879
- " Honor, in the final analysis..."
- "... is all that man has."

145
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,214
Joseph.

146
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:02,803
- Joseph Jarrett!
- Won't you change your quotes?

147
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:07,559
- Put me down.
- Not until you let me have a big kiss.

148
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,520
What have you been doing?

149
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:17,568
After I left here I got out
of law school. Drifted some.

150
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:21,281
Practiced a little.
Spent a couple years in the war.

151
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:25,868
On the wrong side, naturally.
Then I came right back here.

152
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:29,288
Poor Mr. Lantern.
He died, you know.

153
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:33,084
Since then, we haven't been able
to meet the mortgage.

154
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:37,588
- Well, how much is it?
- It's a great deal of money.

155
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:41,926
Much more than you make
practicing law in a year.

156
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:45,846
Well now, would it be
more than that?

157
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:48,475
You made all that
practicing law?

158
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:52,145
Not exactly. I invested
a little in transportation.

159
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:55,691
Stagecoach lines
and railroads, you know.

160
00:21:55,941 --> 00:22:00,863
You put it all in a stagecoach line?
That's risky. Be careful.

161
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:05,533
Just the other day, the stage
was robbed and people were killed.

162
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:11,206
- Somebody got away with $100,000.
- Yeah, I heard that.

163
00:22:11,457 --> 00:22:16,378
The local authorities,
do they know who did it? No.

164
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:21,216
You haven't even thanked me
for the money.

165
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:26,470
I'll thank you, just as soon as
you get out of those clothes.

166
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:30,851
In that outfit,
you'll be nabbed for sure.

167
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:37,189
No smiling Joe Jarrett, no ma 'am.
I'm heading for Galveston.

168
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:43,405
There 's bigger thieves than me
running every bank in town.

169
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:46,992
It's Mr. Burden! Mr. Burden!

170
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:54,333
- Don't go away, Mr. Burden!
- Please wait! Mr. Burden!

171
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:09,306
Mr. Burden, could we talk to you?
We sure would aspire to talk to you.

172
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:13,017
- You know that we're both widows.
- As a banker...

173
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:18,606
...I am proud to serve the widows
of this community and the orphans.

174
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:21,401
It is my sacred
trust to protect...

175
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:25,197
...the savings
that mean so much to your future.

176
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:29,117
The boarding house
has been losing money.

177
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,786
We thought
a clean coat of paint...

178
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:35,916
- ... would help business and--
- We'd like to borrow $100.00.

179
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,669
Nothing would delight me more.

180
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:42,005
- Bless you, Mr. Burden.
- But...

181
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:47,718
...if I loan money to widows,
they might be late with the payments.

182
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:49,054
Mightn't they?

183
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,642
You wouldn't want a sensitive
man like myself...

184
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:57,521
...to foreclose
on poor widows and orphans...

185
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:01,357
...and throw them out into
the streets, now would you?

186
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:04,027
Of course not, Mr. Burden.

187
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:06,570
I knew you'd see it my way.

188
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:11,033
- Good morning, ladies!
- Good morning, Mr. Burden!

189
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:12,786
He's absolutely right.

190
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,955
- We've been thoughtless.
- And he put it so nicely.

191
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:21,795
- It's worse than war.
- What war? There you are.

192
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:28,509
Please, I know you' re upset.
Give me time.

193
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,351
Gentlemen.

194
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:41,607
Please.

195
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:45,736
- Heart attacks he gives me.
- He has to be destroyed.

196
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:53,702
Gentlemen,
Williams was right.

197
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:59,373
This is a war.
The war between us and Zack Thomas.

198
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:05,880
Beg my pardon. Crab Orleans.
T asty, but too rich.

199
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:13,095
Burden, we'll all thank you for
your report on Zack Thomas.

200
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:14,973
Yes, and about time.

201
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:21,395
Yes. Of course.

202
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:27,069
Well, they say
he got away with the money.

203
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,945
That's regrettable.

204
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:33,658
You'll have to fight for your
lives, your business lives.

205
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,246
I suggest $5,000 apiece
to the war chest.

206
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:41,457
- $5,000? I could buy a mountain--
- Gentlemen.

207
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,295
Gentlemen!

208
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:50,175
We wanted an open town
and we got it with Zack Thomas.

209
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,511
And a black day it was.

210
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:58,225
My store caters to the homespun
desires of the Galveston housewife.

211
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:03,896
I've been paying a part of my income
to this Thomas for nearly three years.

212
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:07,067
I never liked it
and I like it even less.

213
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:11,320
I agree Zack has been taking
his job too seriously.

214
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:16,201
I realized that when he said my bank
was like a gambling house...

215
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:21,790
...and demanded a piece
of the action. Now he has to go.

216
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:27,713
With capital, he'll call the tune.
He'll drive us out of business.

217
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,924
- Marie.
- Oui, madame.

218
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:36,180
- Wash and air this in that order.
- Oui, madame.

219
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:40,726
And try to stay out
of Mr. Thomas' way.

220
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:43,979
- He doesn't like too much help.
- Oui, madame.

221
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:47,482
- And neither do l.
- Oui, madame.

222
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:56,783
"Joe Jarrett.

223
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:01,205
Wanted for 16 counts of
larceny, embezzlement...

224
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:06,042
...grand theft, fraud
and disorderly conduct. "

225
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:08,337
Not bad.

226
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:14,050
A shave, a bath.
Quite handsome, actually.

227
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,929
" Disorderly conduct."

228
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:20,640
Elya.

229
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:25,478
- Did you find that circular?
- Yes, and don't roar.

230
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:30,441
Stop mooning over that cheap
four-flusher's picture. Bring it here.

231
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:31,944
Coming, dear.

232
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,614
" Coming, dear."
T ell me, Susie, Fifi...

233
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:39,743
...what does that mean in woman's
talk? T en, five minutes?

234
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,911
A little higher, please.

235
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:44,456
- No, no more.
- Oui, Monsieur Thomas.

236
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:47,334
So, it means,
" Oui, Monsieur Thomas."

237
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,002
Oui, Monsieur Thomas.

238
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:53,506
Nothing like a straight answer
to make a fellow feel secure.

239
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:01,432
I feel like there's
a conspiracy going on.

240
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:05,476
Not against me. That I could handle.
This is more devious.

241
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:11,107
Every damn thing I want is done
one second before I want it done.

242
00:28:11,275 --> 00:28:15,612
But Mr. Thomas, we just do
what Madame Carlson tells us to.

243
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:17,406
Of course. Of course.

244
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:21,076
- I hope you enjoyed the rubdown today.
- lt was exciting.

245
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:24,204
I hope I didn't make
your shower too hot.

246
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:28,375
I doubt if you could make anything
too hot for Mr. Thomas, dear.

247
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,711
Pretty sure of yourself,
aren't you?

248
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:34,422
Of course. Am I not indispensable?

249
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:35,799
Well, l....

250
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:40,720
Girls that giggle are not for you.
When they stop giggling...

251
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:42,680
...I fire them.

252
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,099
Yes, I noticed
quite a turnover.

253
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,522
You have to get older before you
get girls as young as that.

254
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:53,901
How about a week or so?
That'll be fine.

255
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:58,197
Out, all of you. And try not to trip
over your own feet.

256
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:02,659
- Mr. Thomas' shoes need a brush-up.
- Oui, madame.

257
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:06,955
Five thousand dollars.
You want to take my blood too?

258
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,790
Here's my contribution.

259
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:14,837
Gentlemen, thank you.
Thank you, gentlemen. It is--

260
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,852
Excuse me, gentlemen.

261
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:33,981
Just leave your money on the table.
It's a bank. It should be safe.

262
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,067
Amuse yourselves.

263
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:37,652
Have an apple.

264
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:58,549
Matson, I asked you always
to meet me at my house.

265
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:07,390
You were supposed to get rid
of Zack and bring me the money.

266
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:08,557
You did neither.

267
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:11,561
Can you give me a reason
why I should pay you?

268
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:16,607
I lost six of my best men.
That's six good reasons.

269
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:19,610
There was no need
to lose those men.

270
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,948
Perhaps you just handled it badly.

271
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,116
When we planned it...

272
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:29,036
...nobody said a thing about a
sharpshooter on that stage.

273
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:34,208
That's right. We didn't know that.
He might have been hired by Zack.

274
00:30:34,418 --> 00:30:37,421
It don't matter now.
Six men are dead, ain't they?

275
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,928
Now you pay me all of it.

276
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,808
Matson, remove your hand!

277
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:52,019
That's a Chinese silk shirt!

278
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:55,772
I'll pay you.

279
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:10,745
Harvey, you should've hired me
instead of passing me up for Zack.

280
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:14,498
Now you'll have to hire me
to put a bullet in his brain.

281
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:19,129
I'm telling you now,
the day I deliver his body...

282
00:31:19,337 --> 00:31:22,340
...I'm gonna want
a lot more money than this.

283
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:31,432
And just as a bonus,
l' m gonna want Zack Thomas' job.

284
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,691
Like this, you've got...

285
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,945
...me and all this and T exas too.

286
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:46,030
Just a touch.
You know how I like them.

287
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:50,536
- Don't say, " Oui, Monsieur Thomas."
- Oui, Monsieur Thomas.

288
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:55,499
I apologize for the intrusion,
Madame Carlson.

289
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:59,795
This brute has forced me to wait
in the hall and it's important.

290
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:02,338
- Should I throw him out?
- Throw me out!

291
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:05,299
Remember, I'm the president
of the bank...

292
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:08,512
- ... where your employer does business!
- I remember.

293
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:11,682
- Want me to throw him out?
- No, show him this.

294
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:14,058
Sure, boss. Here.

295
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:17,603
I'll be waiting for you
in the bedroom.

296
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:20,399
Won't take long.
I'll be right there.

297
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:27,989
You figure it's the same fellow
on the coach?

298
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:31,534
- The one that got away with the money?
- That's him.

299
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:36,540
Why did you let him get away with it?
I mean, $100,000.

300
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:40,376
He gave me a story about
not having had a hot meal.

301
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:44,714
Beside, what are you so
concerned about? It's my $100,000.

302
00:32:51,805 --> 00:32:53,098
She want something?

303
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:56,226
I don't think you fit the bill, Harv.

304
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:06,444
Here, boss.

305
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,739
I think madame wants a shine.

306
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:13,827
What are you gonna do
about that $100,000?

307
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,039
If you were a young fellow full
of beans with $100,000...

308
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:19,624
...where would you go?

309
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:22,961
How should I know?
I loathe beans.

310
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:27,883
I figure Jarrett would head
for some wide-open town.

311
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,551
Like right here in Galveston.

312
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:34,597
When he does, we'll be waiting
for him. Me and the boys.

313
00:33:34,807 --> 00:33:38,267
This picture's buried in my head
solid, like a rock.

314
00:33:40,312 --> 00:33:43,230
That'll be all, Fifi.
Thank you very much.

315
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,194
- Don't say, " Oui, Monsieur Thomas."
- Oui, Monsieur Thomas.

316
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:49,655
Shut up, Fifi.

317
00:33:54,243 --> 00:33:58,038
Ready for a little workout now?
We'll go a couple of rounds.

318
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:00,499
Let's forget it for today, Chad.

319
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:03,627
Forget it? But how you gonna relax?

320
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:06,088
I'll think of something.

321
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:09,466
I'll see you later
at the office.

322
00:34:09,924 --> 00:34:11,427
Sure, boss.

323
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,890
Oh, here.

324
00:34:18,516 --> 00:34:20,018
Thanks, boss.

325
00:34:21,394 --> 00:34:24,397
What about the riverboat?
Have you foreclosed yet?

326
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:27,359
I can't. The note's not due
for a few weeks.

327
00:34:27,568 --> 00:34:31,405
You know, something tells me
you' re not too happy with me.

328
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:35,659
Me? Zack, how can you say
such a thing?

329
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:37,952
Oh, it's not too hard.

330
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:42,040
There was something peculiar
about the stagecoach incident.

331
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:46,879
What I mean to say is that the bandits
seemed rather well-informed.

332
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:48,839
Zack, what're you saying?

333
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:52,675
What I'm saying is,
if anything happens to me...

334
00:34:52,885 --> 00:34:57,638
...there's a brief of notes on you
and your friends. Understand that?

335
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:01,226
Zack, that means you don't trust me.

336
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:07,023
On the contrary, I trust you
as much as you trust me.

337
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,914
Nice to have seen you, Mr. Burden.

338
00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:27,585
Nice to have seen you.

339
00:35:32,465 --> 00:35:35,927
You know, she's right.
She is indispensable.

340
00:35:40,932 --> 00:35:42,893
Strawberry!

341
00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:50,524
Hey, take a look.

342
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,906
Yeah, how lucky!

343
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:08,250
He's a doll.

344
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:14,925
When did he get to town?

345
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:23,140
Are you sure that's him?

346
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:26,061
It's him, I tell you.

347
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:29,605
All right.

348
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:32,609
Come on, let's go!

349
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:34,777
Let's get him.

350
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:55,507
Here we are, sir.
The Congress Hotel.

351
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:02,972
- Are you sure that's him?
- Yeah, l' m sure.

352
00:37:03,182 --> 00:37:04,183
All right.

353
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:09,186
If I can be of any assistance--

354
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:14,191
- l' m Prince George, at your service.
- Well, stick around. I may need you.

355
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:15,944
Thank you, sir.

356
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:17,528
- Thank you, sir.
- The bag.

357
00:37:17,738 --> 00:37:20,156
It's about time.
I've been waiting for you.

358
00:37:20,448 --> 00:37:22,825
It's good to feel wanted.
Who are you?

359
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:24,368
They call me Angel.

360
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:27,747
That's not as important
as who you are, Mr. Jarrett.

361
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:33,169
- You got my name. What do you want?
- T o save your life. For a price.

362
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:34,713
How much?

363
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:37,715
We'll discuss it later.
You, Max and me.

364
00:37:45,057 --> 00:37:47,516
They want what's in that carpetbag.

365
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:49,311
It's not in there.

366
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:53,732
- How honest are you, and who's Max?
- Do you have time to doubt me or Max?

367
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:55,650
I'll get them for you.

368
00:37:55,858 --> 00:37:58,612
You got a point.
Deposit this in the bank.

369
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:01,782
- Bank?
- The money's in the lining.

370
00:38:05,076 --> 00:38:08,038
Will you wait a minute?
I'll tell you when.

371
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:15,129
Here, my good man. Hold this.

372
00:38:15,337 --> 00:38:17,381
I'm not your good man. He is!

373
00:38:31,812 --> 00:38:34,688
Gentlemen, please.

374
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:42,948
Why, you ruffians!

375
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:58,881
Son, consider yourself temporized.

376
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:27,867
Ain't no money in this bag.
It's empty!

377
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:32,371
- What do you mean? If you' re lying--
- You want to take a look? Go ahead!

378
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,584
The little guy. Angel.

379
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:39,420
The money must've been
in Jarrett's coat. Why that--

380
00:39:39,712 --> 00:39:41,298
I'll get that--

381
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:47,219
- You and that rig of yours for sale?
- We' re for hire, Mr. Jarrett.

382
00:39:50,474 --> 00:39:52,475
Maybe you'll make a gentleman of me.

383
00:39:52,683 --> 00:39:55,145
- lt would be a pleasure.
- Get the bag.

384
00:39:58,315 --> 00:40:00,733
You say this fellow
Jarrett is a lawyer?

385
00:40:00,943 --> 00:40:03,779
Yes, but none of us
are perfect, Mr. Burden.

386
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:06,447
He seems mighty sure of himself.

387
00:40:06,657 --> 00:40:10,993
You' re certain he didn't--
Good morning, Mr. Wallace.

388
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,580
You' re certain he didn't mention
any government affiliations?

389
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:19,043
There are some things that Mr. Jarrett
doesn't discuss with me.

390
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:23,714
You, Mr. Thomas and your partners
have nothing to worry about.

391
00:40:23,882 --> 00:40:25,842
- Right?
- Of course not!

392
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:29,805
Our books are always open
for examination.

393
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:32,890
The people at Galveston
Savings and T rust...

394
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:35,519
...are always pleased
to welcome a depositor.

395
00:40:35,685 --> 00:40:37,354
Yes, I figured as much.

396
00:40:37,562 --> 00:40:41,399
It's a beautiful day.
There's a smell of money in the--

397
00:40:41,817 --> 00:40:45,988
There's a smell of money
in the air today!

398
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:53,579
Adieu, Mr. Burden. Adieu.

399
00:40:56,957 --> 00:41:01,001
Someday, little man,
I'll make you a little man.

400
00:41:07,717 --> 00:41:09,761
$1982.63.

401
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:14,015
- Now, your percentage of that--
- Just totals. I'll figure percentages.

402
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:16,600
As you wish, Mr. Thomas.
Of course.

403
00:41:17,935 --> 00:41:20,521
Roulette, $1538.

404
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:23,983
$1500?
What happened there?

405
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:26,736
There was trouble
with one of the wheels.

406
00:41:27,028 --> 00:41:29,281
You're gonna have to speak up, Alfred.

407
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:31,532
If you don't speak any louder...

408
00:41:31,741 --> 00:41:35,329
...I might suspect that you' re
knocking down on me.

409
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:38,998
Of course, Mr. Thomas.
I'll speak loud. I'll speak real loud.

410
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:40,875
You see this laryngitis--

411
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:45,380
You'll have to speak louder.

412
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:52,971
By the way, Mr. Thomas, these books
are in a terribly disoriented state.

413
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:58,017
Some of the men make their reports
on Wednesdays, some on Thursdays.

414
00:41:58,227 --> 00:42:03,148
By the time I get the figures
and put them in the book, the system--

415
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:05,608
It's just a little off, Alfred.

416
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:10,112
- What'd you say about the roulette?
- Nothing, Mr. Thomas.

417
00:42:10,321 --> 00:42:12,656
- Beat it, Alfred.
- But the figures--

418
00:42:12,824 --> 00:42:15,994
Leave the book here.
You got the bag.

419
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:19,747
- Nice going, Chad.
- Thanks, boss. Yeah, I got it.

420
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:21,541
Some of it.

421
00:42:23,544 --> 00:42:24,710
Some of it?

422
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:27,464
It's empty, boss.

423
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:30,592
It's empty, all right.

424
00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:33,971
The law of averages
caught up with you.

425
00:42:34,179 --> 00:42:38,142
- You just made an accurate statement.
- Thanks, boss.

426
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:39,685
Did you search him?

427
00:42:39,852 --> 00:42:43,479
Well, no, come to think of it.
The little guy, Angel...

428
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:46,108
- ... ran off with his pockets.
- Pockets?

429
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:48,026
I mean, with his coat.

430
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:52,572
Come in.

431
00:42:57,785 --> 00:43:00,371
I've got some news
that'll interest you...

432
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:03,499
...about a deposit that was made
in my bank.

433
00:43:04,418 --> 00:43:06,168
A large deposit.

434
00:43:06,419 --> 00:43:08,380
He's smarter than I thought.

435
00:43:08,547 --> 00:43:10,883
It's only for $75,000, though.

436
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:14,094
What do you think he did
with the other $25,000?

437
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,553
How do I know?

438
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:19,808
All I know is it's my money.
What do you propose to do about it?

439
00:43:20,267 --> 00:43:23,479
As I see it, as a banker...

440
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:26,188
...the money was deposited
quite legally.

441
00:43:26,397 --> 00:43:29,525
It is impossible for you or me...

442
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:33,071
...to lay a finger on it
without legal action.

443
00:43:33,237 --> 00:43:37,784
You understand, naturally,
that such action would freeze it.

444
00:43:38,743 --> 00:43:43,623
You must also understand that anything
I can do for you personally...

445
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:45,876
...I would be happy to do.

446
00:43:46,335 --> 00:43:48,712
Naturally, Harvey, naturally.

447
00:43:49,086 --> 00:43:53,549
But tell me, how long do you think
this money will be frozen?

448
00:43:54,176 --> 00:43:58,471
I wouldn't say the whole process
would take more than one or...

449
00:43:58,763 --> 00:44:00,724
...two years.

450
00:44:03,102 --> 00:44:06,229
Forget about it.
I'll handle it myself, directly.

451
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:08,273
- Where's he staying?
- The Congress.

452
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:12,026
T ell him I'll see him in 1/2 hour
at Orlando's. I'm buying.

453
00:44:12,236 --> 00:44:13,903
Sure, boss.

454
00:44:17,366 --> 00:44:20,201
- Buying what?
- Lunch.

455
00:44:25,873 --> 00:44:27,292
Suppose he ain't hungry?

456
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:32,713
T ell him it's where the women
are young and the bourbon is aged.

457
00:44:32,922 --> 00:44:36,427
- He'll be there.
- Yeah, boss.

458
00:44:39,637 --> 00:44:43,599
Zack, how are you
gonna get that money back?

459
00:44:45,142 --> 00:44:48,480
Harvey, my boy,
I wouldn't be too concerned.

460
00:44:48,689 --> 00:44:50,606
I'll figure a way out.

461
00:44:56,446 --> 00:45:00,659
- Right, but it's $500 short.
- That's my fee for saving your life.

462
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:04,121
$500? A life comes cheap around here.

463
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:07,874
Well, for you I made a special price.

464
00:45:08,082 --> 00:45:13,171
Yes siree, and that includes
fixing your coat.

465
00:45:14,672 --> 00:45:18,843
The minute I saw you, I said
to myself, "Angel, my boy..."

466
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:22,347
"... now he just might
be the boy to do it."

467
00:45:22,514 --> 00:45:23,973
Do what?

468
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:27,311
Cut Zack Thomas
and his crowd down to size.

469
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:31,063
I traded my suit of armor in
for a bank book, right?

470
00:45:31,272 --> 00:45:35,443
If you want someone to champion
your cause, you got the wrong man.

471
00:45:35,652 --> 00:45:37,612
What about the riverboat?

472
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:42,033
They don 't build riverboats
big enough for the two of us.

473
00:45:42,241 --> 00:45:45,829
- Riverboat?
- Max is in trouble. Big trouble.

474
00:45:45,996 --> 00:45:49,208
I figure a man like you,
who doesn't scare so easy--

475
00:45:49,498 --> 00:45:50,833
Going someplace?

476
00:45:53,629 --> 00:45:54,754
Going someplace?

477
00:45:55,296 --> 00:45:57,716
The fight's over. You lost.
Beat it.

478
00:45:58,008 --> 00:45:59,593
Yeah, you' re right.

479
00:46:03,387 --> 00:46:07,100
- That's the way to handle them, boss.
- Oh, I forgot.

480
00:46:07,308 --> 00:46:10,645
Mr. Thomas wants you
at Orlando's in 1/2 hour.

481
00:46:10,854 --> 00:46:13,899
- What's Orlando's?
- It's a restaurant. First-class.

482
00:46:14,106 --> 00:46:15,650
Why meet him there?

483
00:46:15,818 --> 00:46:18,946
The boss has eaten there
every day for four years.

484
00:46:19,236 --> 00:46:21,198
I don't think he'll change now.

485
00:46:21,405 --> 00:46:25,326
Tell him I'll be there in 15
minutes. If he wants to see me...

486
00:46:25,534 --> 00:46:27,204
...he'll do the same thing.

487
00:46:28,371 --> 00:46:29,705
Yeah, Mr. Jarrett.

488
00:46:35,127 --> 00:46:36,546
How did you like that?

489
00:46:36,754 --> 00:46:40,050
With your head and my muscle,
we could run this town.

490
00:46:40,259 --> 00:46:42,386
Now you're talking my language.

491
00:47:58,794 --> 00:48:02,674
I told you, you couldn't come in!
Mr. Harvey's having his--

492
00:48:04,842 --> 00:48:07,638
I told him not to come in,
Master Harvey.

493
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:09,597
Get out.

494
00:48:13,894 --> 00:48:15,979
Did Jarrett deposit the money?

495
00:48:16,854 --> 00:48:19,231
Yes, but it doesn't
make a difference.

496
00:48:19,398 --> 00:48:21,652
It makes a difference to me.

497
00:48:22,194 --> 00:48:25,364
- Now I can kill Zack Thomas.
- No, Matson.

498
00:48:25,531 --> 00:48:29,535
It'll incriminate me, all of us.
We'll go to jail.

499
00:48:29,993 --> 00:48:32,703
Please.
He told me he left a dossier.

500
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:36,082
- I'm fed up to here with Zack Thomas.
- Matson!

501
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:38,167
Please, Matson.

502
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:44,257
We'll see, Harvey, we'll see.
But I ain't making no promises.

503
00:48:45,884 --> 00:48:50,429
In that case,
I feel obliged to warn Zack.

504
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:54,850
No, you won't warn Zack, Harvey.

505
00:48:55,434 --> 00:48:57,270
Because if you do...

506
00:48:57,478 --> 00:49:00,524
...I' m gonna put a bullet
right into that belly!

507
00:49:01,732 --> 00:49:05,696
I know you' re afraid
of spending a long time in jail.

508
00:49:06,404 --> 00:49:11,325
But it's a whole lot better
than spending a long time dying.

509
00:49:20,544 --> 00:49:22,837
Aren't you gonna eat your sandwich?

510
00:49:27,676 --> 00:49:30,721
- Well?
- How can I eat at a time like this?

511
00:49:32,264 --> 00:49:36,769
So long, Harv.
Remember, it's a long time dying.

512
00:49:55,327 --> 00:49:56,454
Shut up!

513
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:11,218
- Good day, Madame Elya.
- Good afternoon, Chester.

514
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:15,807
Mr. Thomas is inside waiting.

515
00:50:25,816 --> 00:50:28,194
- Good afternoon, madame.
- Good afternoon.

516
00:50:28,404 --> 00:50:32,324
How charming you look. How wonderful.
What a charming dress!

517
00:50:32,532 --> 00:50:33,825
My dear.

518
00:50:35,242 --> 00:50:38,539
- I came as soon as--
- We'll have two Zachariah specials.

519
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:41,290
- I'll order lunch later.
- Yes, Mr. Thomas.

520
00:50:41,499 --> 00:50:44,960
I came as soon as I got your message.
But next time...

521
00:50:45,169 --> 00:50:47,046
...do give me some more time.

522
00:50:47,254 --> 00:50:49,548
I loathe to get dressed in a hurry.

523
00:50:49,716 --> 00:50:52,552
You couldn't be more beautiful
if you took three hours.

524
00:50:52,844 --> 00:50:54,972
That's a compliment, I take it.

525
00:50:55,846 --> 00:50:59,517
Now, darling, tell me,
what is so important?

526
00:51:00,185 --> 00:51:01,937
Jarrett's in town.

527
00:51:04,564 --> 00:51:06,524
The man from the wanted poster?

528
00:51:08,943 --> 00:51:11,028
He'll be along in a few minutes.

529
00:51:11,737 --> 00:51:13,407
Elya, honey, I was wondering--

530
00:51:13,614 --> 00:51:17,161
- Your drinks, Mr. Thomas.
- Thank you, Fred.

531
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:24,834
T o your health, darling.

532
00:51:30,214 --> 00:51:34,718
- Elya, honey, I was wondering if you--
- What were you wondering, Zack?

533
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:39,140
When you get that tone
and call me " honey, Elya"...

534
00:51:39,348 --> 00:51:41,517
...you' re usually after something.

535
00:51:41,684 --> 00:51:45,062
You are the most suspicious woman.

536
00:51:45,604 --> 00:51:48,108
I was wondering
if you'd be nice to him.

537
00:51:48,482 --> 00:51:49,735
Nice?

538
00:51:50,568 --> 00:51:52,029
How nice?

539
00:51:52,571 --> 00:51:55,949
About $75,000
worth of nice.

540
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:07,127
Tell me, darling,
this fellow Jarrett....

541
00:52:07,669 --> 00:52:09,546
Is he at least attractive?

542
00:52:09,755 --> 00:52:13,799
From the picture you couldn't tell
what he looked like.

543
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:17,178
He needed a shave.

544
00:52:17,638 --> 00:52:20,974
He couldn't look much better
even with a shave.

545
00:52:21,183 --> 00:52:23,726
He probably has jowls
that hang to there.

546
00:52:24,103 --> 00:52:25,437
T alk about bags...

547
00:52:25,604 --> 00:52:29,358
...I bet he has satchels like
steamer trunks under here.

548
00:52:32,276 --> 00:52:34,238
Does sound funny, doesn't it?

549
00:52:34,654 --> 00:52:37,616
You'll never know, darling.

550
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:40,828
Through laughing?
Let me in on the joke.

551
00:52:42,495 --> 00:52:46,458
I give you a hint, Zack.
In my country, we have a saying:

552
00:52:46,624 --> 00:52:51,587
"A secret whispered in a coffeehouse
is as confidential as a headline."

553
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:56,468
Don't look at me so strangely, Zack.
Laugh, please.

554
00:52:56,635 --> 00:52:58,178
I don't think it's funny.

555
00:52:59,012 --> 00:53:02,975
My darling, this is no time
to lose your sense of humor.

556
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:06,978
I've never known a problem that
Zack Thomas couldn't handle.

557
00:53:07,145 --> 00:53:09,355
- No thanks, Fritz.
- Thank you, sir.

558
00:53:10,898 --> 00:53:15,446
As I was saying, dear,
life is much, much too short to....

559
00:53:20,991 --> 00:53:24,412
- You?
- Not me. Him.

560
00:53:37,008 --> 00:53:39,093
That's an awful fall he took.

561
00:53:40,178 --> 00:53:42,514
I suppose you think
I should thank you.

562
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,681
Look out, Zack!

563
00:53:47,019 --> 00:53:50,271
Fancy place for target practice.
Anybody we know?

564
00:53:50,479 --> 00:53:52,399
Only too well.

565
00:53:58,029 --> 00:54:02,117
If you ain't out of Galveston
by sundown, you'll be real dead.

566
00:54:03,034 --> 00:54:04,244
Get him out of here.

567
00:54:04,453 --> 00:54:07,289
You heard Mr. Thomas.
Get him out of here.

568
00:54:08,874 --> 00:54:12,002
Imagine a thing like that
in a place like this.

569
00:54:17,089 --> 00:54:20,093
What a mistake.
You should've shot his gun hand.

570
00:54:20,302 --> 00:54:24,222
Won't make any difference.
Shoot it off, I'll still get you.

571
00:54:24,388 --> 00:54:26,934
Shoot out my eyes,
I'll still find you!

572
00:54:27,142 --> 00:54:30,270
Put a bullet in my heart,
I'll make a deal with the devil!

573
00:54:30,436 --> 00:54:33,899
I'll trade for enough time
to come back and kill you!

574
00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:35,275
You hear me?

575
00:54:35,484 --> 00:54:38,404
- I'm going to kill you!
- Remember to stay out.

576
00:54:39,154 --> 00:54:41,572
Isn't it awful?

577
00:54:43,908 --> 00:54:45,743
He's loud, isn't he?

578
00:54:47,536 --> 00:54:50,248
If you ever need a friend...

579
00:54:50,498 --> 00:54:53,042
...I wouldn't count on
that character.

580
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:57,963
He had a darling bead centered
in the middle of your forehead.

581
00:54:58,173 --> 00:55:03,552
If he'd missed me an inch either way,
we'd be at your darling funeral.

582
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:07,057
- Okay, that makes us even.
- Not quite.

583
00:55:07,266 --> 00:55:10,394
Still a little matter of $100,000.

584
00:55:10,602 --> 00:55:12,437
Yeah, now I remember.

585
00:55:12,645 --> 00:55:16,023
If you'd remembered to be slower
you'd be a bit richer.

586
00:55:17,525 --> 00:55:20,779
Yeah, I gotta remember that
for the next time.

587
00:55:21,822 --> 00:55:24,865
Charming. Just charming.

588
00:55:25,074 --> 00:55:27,119
Very grateful, this friend of yours.

589
00:55:27,327 --> 00:55:31,206
Oh, yes. I thought you knew.
And very generous too.

590
00:55:31,414 --> 00:55:33,375
Thanks for recognizing me.

591
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:35,669
You knew he was there
all the time?

592
00:55:35,876 --> 00:55:40,632
- l' m sorry, Zack. I couldn't resist.
- l' m glad you didn't.

593
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:45,304
- Would you like to join us?
- Gentlemen, excuse me.

594
00:55:45,469 --> 00:55:48,806
I don't feel quite up to
a chatty little lunch.

595
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:53,437
- You have things to talk about.
- That's right, we have.

596
00:55:54,479 --> 00:55:58,441
I'm sorry I can't lend a hand
at the moment. Perhaps later.

597
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:00,818
In fact, it will be a pleasure.

598
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:04,447
- Goodbye, my dear.
- Au revoir, gentlemen.

599
00:56:07,324 --> 00:56:08,951
Good afternoon.

600
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:16,000
- Let's get down to business.
- I drink much better standing.

601
00:56:16,208 --> 00:56:20,297
- Lead on. I'll follow.
- You'll understand if I get my hat?

602
00:56:20,505 --> 00:56:23,383
You won't need it,
but I'll understand.

603
00:56:27,262 --> 00:56:29,598
- Brandy.
- Yes, Mr. Thomas.

604
00:56:29,805 --> 00:56:34,645
Mr. Jarrett, how many states
would you say you' re wanted in?

605
00:56:34,853 --> 00:56:39,816
- How many states are there?
- I could get you a pardon in T exas.

606
00:56:40,025 --> 00:56:42,903
- For how much?
- $100,000.

607
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:48,240
I give you $100,000,
and you'll get me a pardon?

608
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:51,660
In most states,
I could buy a pardon for $5000...

609
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:55,666
- ... as well as a governor.
- You' re thinking of Rhode lsland.

610
00:56:55,873 --> 00:56:59,878
This here's T exas.
And here, your life goes with it.

611
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:04,966
Now, I'd be no good to you dead.
The money would go to my heirs.

612
00:57:05,174 --> 00:57:06,551
Wife?

613
00:57:06,718 --> 00:57:11,848
Well, not exactly. It's like
an old friend. A good friend.

614
00:57:12,056 --> 00:57:16,353
- And, well, then there are the kids.
- lKids?

615
00:57:16,895 --> 00:57:19,522
All 25 of them.

616
00:57:21,899 --> 00:57:23,569
Twenty-five?

617
00:57:25,277 --> 00:57:28,197
You must have
the fastest horse in T exas.

618
00:57:28,406 --> 00:57:31,493
Have more of this
to keep your strength up.

619
00:57:38,959 --> 00:57:42,545
- Zack!
- I was just coming to see you.

620
00:57:42,753 --> 00:57:45,589
- I know, but please, l--
- This is Jarrett.

621
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,427
This is Joe Jarrett?

622
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:55,100
Why, drinking like friends.
Zack, may I see you in private?

623
00:57:55,266 --> 00:58:00,605
That's fine. I was on my way to draw
out some of my money from your bank.

624
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:08,029
- Matson tried to kill me.
- I had nothing to do with it.

625
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:12,283
- I swear on my sacred word of honor.
- On your what?

626
00:58:12,491 --> 00:58:15,537
I believed you about that dossier...

627
00:58:15,746 --> 00:58:18,332
...and I have loyalty to my board.

628
00:58:18,706 --> 00:58:21,625
I don't know what Matson was thinking.

629
00:58:21,834 --> 00:58:24,296
I told him this was no time to--

630
00:58:24,462 --> 00:58:26,715
I'm not putting a bullet...

631
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:30,176
...in your big fat head
because I might need you.

632
00:58:31,178 --> 00:58:33,972
But I may not need you for long.

633
00:58:38,977 --> 00:58:41,021
Sweet blackberries!

634
00:58:42,856 --> 00:58:44,065
Shrimp!

635
00:58:44,565 --> 00:58:45,734
Clams!

636
00:58:48,362 --> 00:58:52,449
Get your crawfish
right off the shrimp boat!

637
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:57,620
Strawberries!

638
00:59:17,015 --> 00:59:18,975
How does it look to you?

639
00:59:19,183 --> 00:59:24,146
Man, if somebody's looking
for splinters, this is the place.

640
00:59:24,356 --> 00:59:28,317
There's something about
that old boat, Mr. Jarrett.

641
00:59:35,826 --> 00:59:39,955
I won't believe it until
I see Noah come off of that deck.

642
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:43,666
This is really a fine boat.
A little paint...

643
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:48,129
- ... to fix her up and she'd be ready--
- Ready to fall apart.

644
00:59:48,629 --> 00:59:51,048
You should announce yourself.

645
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,344
If I gave a real loud yell...

646
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:58,181
...the vibration would cause
this tub to collapse.

647
00:59:59,725 --> 01:00:01,018
You better duck.

648
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:07,690
- The hat isn't worth anything.
- lt means money in the bank.

649
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:11,068
I've never ducked
from anybody in my life.

650
01:00:11,236 --> 01:00:14,865
Do that again,
I'll shoot through your water line.

651
01:00:15,073 --> 01:00:18,994
- Duck! You don't know Max.
- The unknown don't scare me.

652
01:00:19,201 --> 01:00:22,830
Christopher Columbus' blood
flows through my veins.

653
01:00:31,506 --> 01:00:33,926
Are you all right, Mr. Jarrett?

654
01:00:35,761 --> 01:00:39,013
I remembered
Christopher couldn't swim.

655
01:00:39,221 --> 01:00:41,349
Don't worry, I'll get you out.

656
01:00:43,392 --> 01:00:45,227
Max, hold it!

657
01:00:45,437 --> 01:00:50,399
Angel, throw him that life preserver.
We'll get you out in a jiffy.

658
01:00:50,609 --> 01:00:53,946
I wanted to wait until Saturday
to take a bath.

659
01:00:54,153 --> 01:00:55,531
Here!

660
01:01:00,035 --> 01:01:04,789
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- You trying to save me or sink me?

661
01:01:05,831 --> 01:01:08,209
Over your head. That's it.

662
01:01:08,667 --> 01:01:10,337
Here, George!

663
01:01:12,422 --> 01:01:13,923
Hold onto this belt.

664
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:19,555
You' re doing fine.
You' re just a bit wet, that's all.

665
01:01:19,763 --> 01:01:23,684
Fine Southern hospitality.
Invite me to buy a boat...

666
01:01:23,892 --> 01:01:26,019
...and you try to drown me.

667
01:01:26,227 --> 01:01:28,647
Right, you' re looking great.

668
01:01:28,855 --> 01:01:32,400
Just a little wet, that's all.
There you are.

669
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:39,866
Come down here to help a friend.
What do they do? They--

670
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:44,412
- It's still a fine boat.
- l' m sorry, Max didn't mean nothing.

671
01:01:45,204 --> 01:01:48,791
When Max does mean something,
I hope l' m not around.

672
01:01:49,751 --> 01:01:53,838
Wait till you meet Max, though.
Oh, you' re gonna--

673
01:02:06,809 --> 01:02:09,186
Boy, oh, boy!

674
01:02:15,027 --> 01:02:18,989
Max, meet Mr. Jarrett.
Mr. Jarrett, Maxine Richter.

675
01:02:21,366 --> 01:02:22,326
Howdy, ma'am.

676
01:02:32,084 --> 01:02:36,339
An unwritten law of the sea says
I must make you welcome.

677
01:02:36,632 --> 01:02:39,510
- Come aboard.
- Yes, ma'am.

678
01:02:40,176 --> 01:02:43,554
The firing must have been
a 21 -gun salute.

679
01:02:43,722 --> 01:02:47,224
By the way, which unwritten law
do I come under?

680
01:02:47,434 --> 01:02:50,229
The law of hospitality
to a man overboard.

681
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:52,229
I'm not overboard yet.

682
01:02:52,438 --> 01:02:56,985
Not quite yet, but I will admit
just a little push might do it.

683
01:02:57,236 --> 01:03:00,321
- Max.
- Why do you come here?

684
01:03:01,113 --> 01:03:05,327
- He wants to help you, Miss Maxie.
- By looking at me that way?

685
01:03:05,951 --> 01:03:08,913
Well, don't let
the inflamed eyes fool you.

686
01:03:09,121 --> 01:03:12,125
I always look like that
when I go swimming.

687
01:03:13,961 --> 01:03:18,966
Max is as gentle as a kitten,
when you get to know her.

688
01:03:20,299 --> 01:03:25,513
Being welcomed, can I get out from
under the rifle and into dry clothes?

689
01:03:28,058 --> 01:03:31,437
Come inside. You can
change in my cabin.

690
01:03:35,773 --> 01:03:40,028
- What? It's an unwritten law.
- An unwritten law.

691
01:03:41,113 --> 01:03:43,615
That's right.
Unwritten law.

692
01:03:49,328 --> 01:03:52,332
- My glass is empty.
- Coming, Joe.

693
01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:55,085
Who belongs to
this kimono?

694
01:03:55,334 --> 01:03:57,504
- My husband.
- Your husband?

695
01:03:57,713 --> 01:04:00,924
He was shot dead in
a poker game last year.

696
01:04:01,091 --> 01:04:02,134
T oo bad.

697
01:04:03,384 --> 01:04:07,973
- A professional gambler?
- Not professional enough, apparently.

698
01:04:08,181 --> 01:04:14,146
Now you're looking for somebody to
provide you with security. Right?

699
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:19,359
The boat is my security.
I'm looking for a deal.

700
01:04:19,651 --> 01:04:23,738
If somebody wanted to fix it up
as a casino, for instance...

701
01:04:23,946 --> 01:04:28,493
...I would be interested
in any proposition.

702
01:04:29,536 --> 01:04:33,623
I like the service here.
I could make you a proposition.

703
01:04:33,831 --> 01:04:34,791
Good.

704
01:04:35,334 --> 01:04:39,963
- I have a couple of questions for you.
- You go right ahead.

705
01:04:40,171 --> 01:04:44,842
I want to be totally clear. I have no
complaints about the hospitality.

706
01:04:45,092 --> 01:04:50,349
- You have been pleased?
- Yes. It was a pleasure being aboard.

707
01:04:50,724 --> 01:04:54,645
But I was just wondering about
a few little details.

708
01:04:54,853 --> 01:04:57,897
Why did you take
those shots at me?

709
01:04:58,063 --> 01:05:02,444
The men here think a European woman
is available, just like so.

710
01:05:02,818 --> 01:05:07,324
But the shots were a warning.
I can be approached...

711
01:05:07,531 --> 01:05:12,453
- ... but on my own terms.
- I see. Courtship, European-style.

712
01:05:12,953 --> 01:05:16,416
I like it,
except the first few minutes.

713
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:20,294
I wasn't trying to hit you. It was...

714
01:05:20,795 --> 01:05:23,465
...how you say,
a come-along.

715
01:05:23,881 --> 01:05:28,552
- " Come-along "? A come-on?
- A come-on.

716
01:05:28,844 --> 01:05:34,226
A 30-caliber come-on. What was with
the crockery and the slap in the face?

717
01:05:34,434 --> 01:05:37,520
Is that more
of that maidenly resistance?

718
01:05:37,728 --> 01:05:41,607
No. That was for the benefit
of the hired help.

719
01:05:41,857 --> 01:05:46,655
- A girl's got her reputation.
- Not my reputation, yours.

720
01:05:46,904 --> 01:05:51,575
Those two will serve you better
if they think you are masterful.

721
01:05:51,742 --> 01:05:53,619
I think I'm being used.

722
01:05:54,329 --> 01:05:59,251
No. You're not being used,
you're being served.

723
01:05:59,501 --> 01:06:01,210
I'm being served?

724
01:06:01,418 --> 01:06:07,133
But why me? Why was I elected?
Why not Zachary Thomas, for instance?

725
01:06:07,342 --> 01:06:12,930
I was giving him the come-along too.
Then Angel told me you got the money.

726
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:17,143
Fortunately, I like honesty in a
partner. All right, honey.

727
01:06:17,351 --> 01:06:20,397
I'll throw in the money.
Have it fixed up.

728
01:06:20,647 --> 01:06:22,815
We'll be equal partners.

729
01:06:23,023 --> 01:06:27,278
- Equal partners will not work.
- I don't take orders too good.

730
01:06:27,486 --> 01:06:31,825
But I do. You will give the orders.
You will be the master.

731
01:06:32,034 --> 01:06:34,161
I give the orders?

732
01:06:34,411 --> 01:06:37,748
All right. Make that new.
Go on. Another drink.

733
01:06:38,081 --> 01:06:39,124
Yes, sir.

734
01:06:40,833 --> 01:06:43,754
What I don't understand
about European women is...

735
01:06:43,961 --> 01:06:46,173
...why you want me to be
lord and master when l...

736
01:06:46,423 --> 01:06:50,636
- ... offered you a partnership?
- It's my training, Joe.

737
01:06:50,844 --> 01:06:53,930
How things should be
between a man and a woman.

738
01:06:54,305 --> 01:06:58,393
A man as a partner, I don't
understand. But a master....

739
01:06:58,809 --> 01:07:02,938
A master,
him I know how to handle.

740
01:07:03,189 --> 01:07:06,735
Don't go away, Max.
I just thought of another order.

741
01:07:12,449 --> 01:07:17,162
- We' re in business.
- Maybe we' re in business.

742
01:08:56,762 --> 01:08:59,598
I never saw a
lady barber before.

743
01:08:59,805 --> 01:09:04,019
- Are there barber schools for ladies?
- No, I learned as a girl.

744
01:09:04,269 --> 01:09:07,898
I remember Mama went after Papa
with a razor a few times.

745
01:09:08,105 --> 01:09:11,401
Zack, why are you letting them
fix up that old tub?

746
01:09:11,610 --> 01:09:15,030
Why would a lady of your breeding
and background...

747
01:09:15,239 --> 01:09:18,116
- ... want to be a barber?
- The money.

748
01:09:18,325 --> 01:09:21,745
At the moment it's all
under his name in your bank.

749
01:09:21,953 --> 01:09:24,747
- How am I gonna get ahold of it?
- Breeding is acquired.

750
01:09:24,957 --> 01:09:26,000
By legal action.

751
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:29,960
- Being a barber gives you breeding?
- But that would take time.

752
01:09:30,128 --> 01:09:33,589
I thought I'd try to
sabotage his effort to renovate.

753
01:09:33,799 --> 01:09:37,009
Do you think
this fellow would discourage easily?

754
01:09:37,219 --> 01:09:38,220
No.

755
01:09:38,428 --> 01:09:42,599
When we're done, they'll
be glad to sell the boat for $7.12.

756
01:09:45,143 --> 01:09:49,063
- All right, next. Name?
- Mancini. Pete Mancini.

757
01:09:49,271 --> 01:09:55,153
Pete Mancini.
All right, next.

758
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,571
- Name?
- Fred Welsh.

759
01:09:57,863 --> 01:10:00,576
In the saloon, Mancini.
Max'll give you the uniform.

760
01:10:00,783 --> 01:10:03,661
- No guns.
- What if there's any trouble?

761
01:10:03,828 --> 01:10:07,832
Clubs, hammers, fists, feet.
Anything but guns. Now move it.

762
01:10:08,166 --> 01:10:11,044
- Next.
- Five more men, Mr. Jarrett.

763
01:10:11,253 --> 01:10:14,214
- All right, bring 'em on down.
- Come on.

764
01:10:17,342 --> 01:10:21,764
No. You must look as though
you were born to it.

765
01:10:21,972 --> 01:10:26,685
I was born to an alcoholic daddy
who liked all the dollies.

766
01:10:26,851 --> 01:10:28,520
I figure Daddy was right.

767
01:10:29,354 --> 01:10:34,942
Go find your alcohol and your dollies
somewhere else. Now get out!

768
01:10:35,151 --> 01:10:36,151
All right.

769
01:10:38,697 --> 01:10:41,157
What would
your daddy say to that?

770
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:43,701
Why you....

771
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:47,998
Joe!

772
01:10:58,382 --> 01:11:00,384
All right,
get rid of him.

773
01:11:00,594 --> 01:11:05,557
Tell Zack I got his message
and I'll deliver his reply personally.

774
01:11:05,808 --> 01:11:07,810
Oh, men!

775
01:11:08,226 --> 01:11:12,522
Anybody else with comments
on what they like or not?

776
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:17,026
- Can I see you for a moment?
- Sure. Why not?

777
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,799
Why are you going ashore
to see Zack Thomas?

778
01:11:39,006 --> 01:11:42,509
Every square inch
of paint we scraped around here...

779
01:11:42,718 --> 01:11:45,598
...Zack feels like it's coming
off his hide.

780
01:11:45,763 --> 01:11:47,807
He sent him to start trouble.

781
01:11:48,016 --> 01:11:51,312
He sends one stupid little
man to slow us down?

782
01:11:54,563 --> 01:11:57,149
He paid that man
to insult me...

783
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:01,445
...so you'd go into Zack's
territory with that red in your eye.

784
01:12:02,156 --> 01:12:04,241
If that was his plan,
it worked.

785
01:12:04,448 --> 01:12:09,038
Do you have any reason to think
I admire Zack Thomas?

786
01:12:09,245 --> 01:12:11,205
You gave him
the old come-along.

787
01:12:11,415 --> 01:12:16,460
I heard you been shooting a lot of
ammunition to flirt with Casanova.

788
01:12:17,212 --> 01:12:19,213
Don't shoot at him again.

789
01:12:19,381 --> 01:12:25,386
If you raise the rifle at other men,
I'll break it over your pretty skull.

790
01:12:25,596 --> 01:12:29,932
Joe, there is
no reason to be jealous.

791
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:36,772
All right, so I gave Zack Thomas
a little come-along.

792
01:12:39,234 --> 01:12:43,529
But, Joe, I didn't
let him come aboard.

793
01:13:05,968 --> 01:13:09,973
- Good afternoon, Mrs. T rowbridge.
- Good afternoon, Williams.

794
01:13:17,356 --> 01:13:20,233
- Good afternoon, Madame T rowbridge.
- Good afternoon.

795
01:13:20,442 --> 01:13:23,861
- Madame Elya will be with you soon.
- Thank you.

796
01:13:26,156 --> 01:13:29,701
Isn't it lucky?
Now we both got fellows.

797
01:13:30,744 --> 01:13:32,036
Of our own.

798
01:13:33,037 --> 01:13:35,541
- Shall we
- Yes, we shall.

799
01:13:37,542 --> 01:13:40,461
It's showtime, Mr. Jarrett.

800
01:13:40,919 --> 01:13:45,968
- I could've outfitted an army by now.
- Not this kind of army, Boss.

801
01:13:51,472 --> 01:13:53,975
We are ready, monsieur.

802
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:59,898
- That is gorgeous.
- Would you care to sit here?

803
01:14:00,107 --> 01:14:01,231
Beautiful.

804
01:14:06,113 --> 01:14:07,446
How do you like it?

805
01:14:08,155 --> 01:14:12,326
Just ease it across the hips a
little and bring up the neckline.

806
01:14:12,995 --> 01:14:16,831
I understand how it is
when one contemplates marriage.

807
01:14:17,915 --> 01:14:22,086
Marriage? Marriage is
for married people.

808
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:27,383
Now that you're serious,
you're already acting like a husband.

809
01:14:27,758 --> 01:14:32,306
I am definitely not a husband
and I never intend to become one.

810
01:14:32,513 --> 01:14:37,685
Marriage has nothing to do with it.
It's all right if she wants to go--

811
01:14:37,894 --> 01:14:40,105
In the altogether, Joe?

812
01:14:40,354 --> 01:14:42,107
Put it any way you want--

813
01:14:42,316 --> 01:14:45,693
If you show them everything,
they may not come back.

814
01:14:46,735 --> 01:14:48,489
That's part of it.

815
01:14:48,654 --> 01:14:53,660
- Good afternoon, Zack.
- Elya, you look absolutely charming.

816
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:58,706
You've succeeded
in gilding the lily.

817
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:02,334
And that's
some lily-gilding.

818
01:15:02,628 --> 01:15:07,841
If you will excuse me, I have
so many other lilies to gild.

819
01:15:12,471 --> 01:15:14,598
- May l, Bill?
- Yes, sir.

820
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:20,145
- When are you planning to open?
- When the workmen are finished.

821
01:15:20,312 --> 01:15:24,231
That's too bad.
We hardly know each other.

822
01:15:24,483 --> 01:15:30,404
There's hardly been time with all
your other interests and... activities.

823
01:15:30,656 --> 01:15:35,576
That's true. We've all been
very busy in our own little way.

824
01:15:37,037 --> 01:15:42,375
Madame. Joe.
May the best man win.

825
01:15:42,793 --> 01:15:46,797
- So far there's no contest.
- So far.

826
01:15:47,213 --> 01:15:49,840
- The game isn't over yet.
- Right.

827
01:15:50,174 --> 01:15:53,802
I hear the northwest
docks might be condemned.

828
01:15:54,011 --> 01:15:55,681
What does he mean, Joe?

829
01:15:57,515 --> 01:16:01,769
He means our customers can't
cross the docks to get to the boat.

830
01:16:02,562 --> 01:16:06,775
- Not cross the docks?
- And it's a shame, too, isn't it?

831
01:16:06,982 --> 01:16:09,568
After spending all of
that nice money.

832
01:16:09,778 --> 01:16:15,199
- But there are other docks.
- Yes, there are other docks.

833
01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:19,079
But they're all controlled by
Mr. Harvey Burden. Right?

834
01:16:19,495 --> 01:16:22,540
Your grasp of the
situation is precise.

835
01:16:24,292 --> 01:16:28,337
T oo bad because there isn't
another berth in Galveston.

836
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:36,847
- I think you might be interested.
- Thank you, Bill.

837
01:16:44,730 --> 01:16:47,816
You'll excuse me.
See you later, darling.

838
01:16:48,023 --> 01:16:50,027
Yes, of course.

839
01:16:51,903 --> 01:16:55,240
- Shall we?
- We shall.

840
01:16:56,365 --> 01:16:58,951
Boss, take a look.

841
01:17:06,585 --> 01:17:10,421
" Consigned and insured by
Mr. Zack Thomas."

842
01:17:10,797 --> 01:17:13,549
So it's an insurance job?

843
01:17:14,216 --> 01:17:17,845
Find out if there are any survivors.

844
01:17:18,055 --> 01:17:23,684
- lt says that all are lost.
- lf l' m right, there's one survivor.

845
01:17:23,894 --> 01:17:26,812
The one who got paid
to pull the plug.

846
01:17:27,022 --> 01:17:31,151
- You go find him.
- Leave it to me. I'll find him.

847
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:50,210
One gross lot lavender smelling salts,
500--

848
01:17:50,379 --> 01:17:52,047
Ladies' saloon?

849
01:17:52,381 --> 01:17:56,926
That's a mistake. It should have
been "salon," not "saloon."

850
01:17:57,177 --> 01:17:58,637
I' m not so sure.

851
01:17:58,804 --> 01:18:02,349
With these prices,
it'd be cheaper to drink.

852
01:18:02,556 --> 01:18:07,020
Do me a favor, Max? Will you get me
some coffee? Black. Strong.

853
01:18:07,229 --> 01:18:08,689
- Joe?
- Yeah?

854
01:18:08,896 --> 01:18:13,860
- How do you like my new neglige?
- It's fine. You look good in anything.

855
01:18:14,068 --> 01:18:17,279
Max, will you get me
the coffee please?

856
01:18:17,573 --> 01:18:21,867
The galley's so far away
and the fire is probably out.

857
01:18:22,076 --> 01:18:26,580
- I have some brandy in my cabin.
- Yes, sure.

858
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:31,169
I want coffee.
She wants brandy.

859
01:18:33,171 --> 01:18:36,258
Women. You can see
right through them!

860
01:18:37,926 --> 01:18:41,303
I didn't remodel a boat,
I bought a fleet!

861
01:18:42,681 --> 01:18:46,268
Do you mind spending money
for things you really want?

862
01:18:46,475 --> 01:18:50,981
Not if it's something
I really want. What's money?

863
01:18:51,188 --> 01:18:57,196
I'm glad you feel that way. Men who
worry about little things bore me.

864
01:18:59,530 --> 01:19:00,866
Brandy?

865
01:19:07,122 --> 01:19:10,834
Perhaps you prefer
to have something else?

866
01:19:12,252 --> 01:19:16,048
Oh, no, this is fine.
No, it's fine.

867
01:19:16,339 --> 01:19:22,179
Oh, poor Joe,
you were so thirsty.

868
01:19:26,392 --> 01:19:28,684
You didn't notice what l' m wearing.

869
01:19:28,894 --> 01:19:31,688
- You' re wearing something?
- lf you don't like it--

870
01:19:31,854 --> 01:19:34,649
No. Dear, there's
a draft out there.

871
01:19:34,857 --> 01:19:38,445
You can sit down here.
You can catch a cold.

872
01:19:39,695 --> 01:19:45,202
- I like men who worry about me.
- Don't worry. I' m a great worrier.

873
01:19:45,409 --> 01:19:48,205
Sometimes I worry
for months on end.

874
01:19:49,206 --> 01:19:53,877
After this afternoon, you might think
my gown is too revealing.

875
01:19:55,336 --> 01:19:57,963
Do you think my gown
is too revealing?

876
01:19:58,173 --> 01:20:02,468
No. T oo many clothes, you get
overheated. It's unhealthy.

877
01:20:02,677 --> 01:20:07,099
But earlier, at Madame Elya's,
you said they were too revealing.

878
01:20:07,306 --> 01:20:09,892
Oh, I must have been crazy.

879
01:20:10,102 --> 01:20:13,479
Perhaps you feel like most
American men do.

880
01:20:15,147 --> 01:20:18,569
I don't feel any less.
I guarantee you that.

881
01:20:18,776 --> 01:20:24,741
Most American men pretend to dislike
in public what they prefer in private.

882
01:20:25,616 --> 01:20:31,498
I'm not into crowds. But if you
want audience, you go to a saloon.

883
01:20:34,626 --> 01:20:37,419
How do you feel
about marriage, Joe?

884
01:20:38,171 --> 01:20:40,673
Fine, but
who'd have us?

885
01:20:44,844 --> 01:20:48,766
Oh, no, Max. You' re not
thinking about marriage?

886
01:20:50,684 --> 01:20:55,439
Of course not. Why should l
think about marriage?

887
01:20:55,646 --> 01:21:00,777
That's why I like you, Max. You got
brains. You think like a man.

888
01:21:01,068 --> 01:21:06,282
I'm glad, Joe. Then it doesn't
bother you that I'm a woman?

889
01:21:06,492 --> 01:21:12,371
With what you got on, I'd be in
trouble if you were a man.

890
01:21:12,581 --> 01:21:17,126
After the boat opens and you're a
success, what'll you do then, Joe?

891
01:21:17,335 --> 01:21:21,297
- Count money.
- lt can't be very much fun alone.

892
01:21:21,506 --> 01:21:24,341
There'd be you and me.

893
01:21:24,508 --> 01:21:29,013
- Just the two of us?
- You' re talking about a crowd again.

894
01:21:29,221 --> 01:21:32,308
It might be less
drafty in my cabin, Joe.

895
01:21:32,518 --> 01:21:37,147
- I'll go close the windows.
- The windows are already closed.

896
01:21:37,354 --> 01:21:42,234
- I'll go open them. It's healthier.
- Will you do it for me, Joe?

897
01:21:42,444 --> 01:21:47,699
- Open the windows in my cabin?
- Oh, come on, Max.

898
01:21:48,407 --> 01:21:52,495
If I go to that cabin,
we know what's gonna happen.

899
01:21:52,703 --> 01:21:55,832
You'll be thinking
about marriage again.

900
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:58,043
But I think like a man, Joe.

901
01:21:58,250 --> 01:22:01,336
- You said so.
- You don't look like a man.

902
01:22:01,545 --> 01:22:04,925
- Please, Joe.
- No.

903
01:22:05,132 --> 01:22:08,595
- Joe, please?
- No!

904
01:22:09,178 --> 01:22:10,846
Please, Joe.

905
01:22:21,857 --> 01:22:27,865
I'll be in here, Joe.
I'll wait for you.

906
01:22:29,408 --> 01:22:32,077
- Please, Joe.
- No.

907
01:22:34,412 --> 01:22:35,871
Joe, please.

908
01:22:38,291 --> 01:22:40,794
Why should I be strong?

909
01:22:41,001 --> 01:22:47,009
I found him! Me, Angel.
The sole survivor of the Spindrift.

910
01:22:47,467 --> 01:22:52,389
- The Spindrift?.
- Come. I'll take you to him. Let's go!

911
01:22:52,596 --> 01:22:55,224
- Well, you' re coming?
- l' m coming.

912
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:58,062
Oh, men!

913
01:22:59,228 --> 01:23:03,108
- What was that?
- The wind.

914
01:23:03,566 --> 01:23:06,445
There's a hell of a storm coming up.

915
01:23:09,238 --> 01:23:13,243
- Hey, then what's that?
- The storm's getting worse.

916
01:23:19,165 --> 01:23:22,710
Mr. Burden hired me
to scuttle the Spindrift.

917
01:23:22,919 --> 01:23:27,799
- Burden? With or without cotton?
- Without.

918
01:23:28,465 --> 01:23:33,721
Burden made a deal with
a broker, insured the cotton...

919
01:23:33,931 --> 01:23:37,850
...then we left it on the dock
and sailed out empty.

920
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:43,647
Couple of days later I scuttled
the boat. Came back here.

921
01:23:44,732 --> 01:23:46,443
T o collect from Burden.

922
01:23:47,944 --> 01:23:53,949
I collected all right.
A full load in the guts.

923
01:23:56,786 --> 01:23:59,665
I better get him
out of here, Mr. Jarrett.

924
01:23:59,830 --> 01:24:03,710
He won't be much of a witness
without that hole plugged up.

925
01:24:03,876 --> 01:24:07,171
Looks like our witness
just ran out on us.

926
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:13,137
As far as anyone knows
he's still alive and ready to talk.

927
01:24:23,605 --> 01:24:24,813
Where are they?

928
01:24:25,023 --> 01:24:28,110
- ln your office.
- My office? Why my office?

929
01:24:28,318 --> 01:24:31,405
They said it'd be all right.

930
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:45,668
Come right in. Make yourself at
home. We've been waiting for you.

931
01:24:45,877 --> 01:24:48,130
So I see.

932
01:24:49,922 --> 01:24:53,509
Real cozy place
you got here, Mr. Burden.

933
01:24:56,554 --> 01:25:02,561
Sit down, Mr. Burden.
Mr. Jarrett wishes to talk to you.

934
01:25:09,233 --> 01:25:13,237
Last night we talked with
the owner of that hat.

935
01:25:18,075 --> 01:25:21,704
You couldn't have.
There weren't any survivors.

936
01:25:23,205 --> 01:25:27,376
- Crew's all dead.
- All dead? Not this one.

937
01:25:27,586 --> 01:25:31,005
He's on his way to north T exas,
where he'll be safe.

938
01:25:31,214 --> 01:25:35,134
If you want us to send for him
and bring him back--

939
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:48,940
I don't understand you, Harvey.
He just plain blackmailed you.

940
01:25:49,650 --> 01:25:52,110
Why did you sign the lease?

941
01:25:52,277 --> 01:25:57,156
Zack, please. I told you I signed
impulsively to... to protect you.

942
01:25:57,366 --> 01:26:01,662
- I was afraid they would hang you.
- Hang me?

943
01:26:01,869 --> 01:26:06,333
Don't be ridiculous! I wouldn't
touch a false insurance claim.

944
01:26:06,582 --> 01:26:11,086
Let alone scuttle a ship
and murder 35 men!

945
01:26:11,253 --> 01:26:14,757
- What gave you the idea he had a case?
- I don't know.

946
01:26:14,924 --> 01:26:19,428
What're we gonna do
about Jarrett and his gambling boat?

947
01:26:19,637 --> 01:26:25,142
You don't leave me much choice.
He now has the dock rights.

948
01:26:25,477 --> 01:26:29,189
But don't worry.
Opening night will be closing night.

949
01:26:29,564 --> 01:26:31,358
I hope so.

950
01:26:32,692 --> 01:26:38,115
I sometimes feel I don't have the
intestinal fortitude for this job.

951
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:42,745
I think guts is the word, Harv.
What you don't have is guts.

952
01:26:45,538 --> 01:26:47,291
That could well be.

953
01:26:52,294 --> 01:26:56,300
I expect to see you
and the missis at the opening.

954
01:26:57,843 --> 01:27:02,431
We wouldn't want Jarrett to think
we forgot our manners, would we?

955
01:27:03,931 --> 01:27:06,434
No, I guess not.

956
01:27:09,855 --> 01:27:12,858
Good morning,
Madame Carlson.

957
01:27:13,774 --> 01:27:15,569
What's bothering him?

958
01:27:16,069 --> 01:27:20,030
Harvey's not thrilled
about going to the opening.

959
01:27:20,741 --> 01:27:24,243
You're not allowing them
to open that ridiculous boat?

960
01:27:24,453 --> 01:27:28,414
Them or they may be just
a lot brighter than all of us.

961
01:27:28,624 --> 01:27:32,042
And another thing.
You are going to the opening.

962
01:27:32,252 --> 01:27:36,171
Don't bother to ask any questions,
because I want you to go.

963
01:27:37,382 --> 01:27:42,805
- Any other questions?
- No other questions.

964
01:27:43,345 --> 01:27:44,348
Zack!

965
01:27:46,850 --> 01:27:51,228
- I love you.
- Sure you do, sweetheart.

966
01:27:51,438 --> 01:27:56,025
- And I love you too.
- I didn't mean it that way.

967
01:27:56,483 --> 01:28:01,739
- No? How did you mean it?
- I want to get married.

968
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:06,494
- ls that all?
- ls there more?

969
01:28:07,079 --> 01:28:10,539
Frankly, there's much more.

970
01:28:11,666 --> 01:28:14,961
Like the question
of your happiness.

971
01:28:15,169 --> 01:28:19,381
Right now you're well
taken care of. Secure.

972
01:28:19,591 --> 01:28:22,093
But suppose I said yes.

973
01:28:22,761 --> 01:28:25,805
And then I went
out there and they--

974
01:28:26,015 --> 01:28:30,728
Let me put it this way. A gambler's
not a very good insurance risk.

975
01:28:30,935 --> 01:28:35,273
And the people who disturb me
most at funerals are the women.

976
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,650
Especially widows.

977
01:28:38,818 --> 01:28:44,825
But the sight of you in sackcloth is
something more than I bargained for.

978
01:28:45,449 --> 01:28:50,288
Then you do love me? Please quit.
Before they kill you.

979
01:28:51,624 --> 01:28:57,129
If they do, you'll be busy whipping up
a mourning outfit and forget about me.

980
01:28:57,337 --> 01:29:00,673
- Zack!
- What?

981
01:29:01,215 --> 01:29:02,426
Kiss me?

982
01:29:03,969 --> 01:29:07,346
IKissing you is always
a pleasure, darling.

983
01:29:12,143 --> 01:29:14,896
There she is. All done.

984
01:29:15,104 --> 01:29:20,694
I think she looks pretty damn good.
She looks beautiful.

985
01:29:22,321 --> 01:29:27,158
Joseph, I'm really proud of you.
You did a wonderful job.

986
01:29:27,367 --> 01:29:31,205
Our boat. It looks fantastic.

987
01:29:31,412 --> 01:29:37,294
Not me, Max, us. All of us
made our boat look fantastic.

988
01:29:37,836 --> 01:29:41,590
- Want me to try, Mr. Jarrett?
- Let her blow!

989
01:29:52,224 --> 01:29:53,851
Lower to the left.

990
01:29:55,187 --> 01:29:57,896
- All right?
- Perfect. Now nail it on.

991
01:30:01,777 --> 01:30:03,946
Gentlemen, please be our guest.

992
01:30:11,577 --> 01:30:15,206
I name you La Maison Rouge.

993
01:30:15,416 --> 01:30:20,212
Here is to all of you hardworking
gentlemen who made this possible.

994
01:30:20,377 --> 01:30:23,131
If you have any wages
burning a hole...

995
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:26,259
...in your pocket,
you know where to go.

996
01:30:26,468 --> 01:30:30,930
- Captain, who pays the two dollars?
- What two dollars?

997
01:30:31,098 --> 01:30:32,848
Easy with the picture.

998
01:30:33,058 --> 01:30:37,186
Be serious, we gotta find out
who this picture belongs to.

999
01:30:39,188 --> 01:30:41,357
You must be Miss Maxine.

1000
01:30:41,525 --> 01:30:44,401
The storage company
sent us to deliver your picture.

1001
01:30:44,569 --> 01:30:49,783
- What makes you so sure it's hers?
- It's her all right.

1002
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:53,202
Are you kidding?
Come take a look.

1003
01:30:57,624 --> 01:31:00,501
You guys recede.

1004
01:31:01,585 --> 01:31:06,425
- She really posed for that?
- Yes, that's me.

1005
01:31:06,633 --> 01:31:07,634
Yeah.

1006
01:31:07,842 --> 01:31:13,556
- I wonder if he did it from memory.
- Yeah, that's her.

1007
01:31:13,724 --> 01:31:16,435
- I wish my wife looked like that.
- Yeah.

1008
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:21,355
This was all my husband left me.
He was a connoisseur of art.

1009
01:31:21,565 --> 01:31:24,693
Shame he didn't leave you
clothes to go with it.

1010
01:31:26,110 --> 01:31:30,616
- Who pays the two dollars?
- As soon as you hang it over the bar.

1011
01:31:30,781 --> 01:31:34,827
- Up the gangplank, to the starboard.
- Yes, ma'am.

1012
01:31:34,994 --> 01:31:39,458
- Starboard is to the right.
- That's where l' m going.

1013
01:31:39,624 --> 01:31:42,419
When I say go,
we'll point to the right.

1014
01:31:42,586 --> 01:31:44,463
Go!

1015
01:31:46,548 --> 01:31:50,593
I'll do it so even you can understand.
Now go!

1016
01:31:52,429 --> 01:31:54,431
- Curly Joe.
- What?

1017
01:31:54,638 --> 01:31:56,642
- He's a nitwit.
- He's stupid.

1018
01:31:56,807 --> 01:32:01,188
Now when I say "go" we'll all
point to the right. Go!

1019
01:32:01,396 --> 01:32:03,357
Now he's stupid.

1020
01:32:03,564 --> 01:32:07,486
Captain, help me out? I' m
dealing with two mental midgets.

1021
01:32:07,653 --> 01:32:11,782
When I say "go" we'll all point
to the right. Go!

1022
01:32:13,616 --> 01:32:15,995
- Go!
- There they are!

1023
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:18,162
There they are!

1024
01:32:18,329 --> 01:32:20,331
Now wait a minute.

1025
01:32:20,831 --> 01:32:22,333
Stop beating up on me!

1026
01:32:22,542 --> 01:32:25,961
Leave her alone.
She reminds me of my mother.

1027
01:32:26,171 --> 01:32:27,756
We didn't mean any harm.

1028
01:32:29,673 --> 01:32:32,594
- I told you.
- You never had a mother.

1029
01:32:32,802 --> 01:32:35,639
- Shame on you.
- Remind me to have you stuffed.

1030
01:32:35,846 --> 01:32:38,809
That picture is a disgrace
to Galveston.

1031
01:32:39,016 --> 01:32:41,520
You won't hang
that disgraceful picture.

1032
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:46,273
Get your mother
out of here, Whistler!

1033
01:32:50,569 --> 01:32:52,071
Get her in that chair.

1034
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:54,575
T ake it easy.
She'll be all right.

1035
01:32:54,782 --> 01:32:58,120
- Don't worry, Mildred.
- ls she all right?

1036
01:33:00,329 --> 01:33:03,583
- These wheelchairs are dangerous.
- Are you all right?

1037
01:33:03,792 --> 01:33:06,003
Yes. You'll be all right.

1038
01:33:08,379 --> 01:33:09,713
Just a minute.

1039
01:33:09,922 --> 01:33:14,969
You struck one of the toughest men
from T exas. T ell her, T ex.

1040
01:33:15,178 --> 01:33:18,139
- Oh, did l?
- Maybe you don't understand.

1041
01:33:18,348 --> 01:33:22,728
He's the toughest man
from T exas. Give her an adjective.

1042
01:33:23,729 --> 01:33:25,147
Wait a minute.

1043
01:33:32,653 --> 01:33:35,741
It couldn't be better
if we planned it.

1044
01:33:35,906 --> 01:33:39,745
- How so?
- It's the oldest military tactic.

1045
01:33:39,912 --> 01:33:43,457
IKeep the enemy fighting
among themselves.

1046
01:33:43,664 --> 01:33:47,169
Let them fight. Let them beat
each other to a pulp.

1047
01:33:47,376 --> 01:33:52,883
Then we'll move in on Mr. Jarrett
and Mr. Thomas with 200 men.

1048
01:33:53,215 --> 01:33:54,759
Fresh men.

1049
01:33:56,761 --> 01:34:01,225
And here's the man
I've taken care of...

1050
01:34:01,432 --> 01:34:05,395
...and nurtured to be the leader
of our gladiators.

1051
01:34:05,603 --> 01:34:10,067
Gentlemen, an old friend of yours.

1052
01:34:19,241 --> 01:34:21,120
Why, it's Matson.

1053
01:34:24,956 --> 01:34:28,459
That's right, gentlemen. Mr. Matson.

1054
01:34:29,211 --> 01:34:30,796
Wonder when he got back.

1055
01:34:31,004 --> 01:34:34,381
- He looks fully recovered.
- He sure does.

1056
01:34:34,591 --> 01:34:39,595
- Can he still use his gun hand?
- Matson, tell the gentlemen...

1057
01:34:39,970 --> 01:34:43,851
...how carefully we planned
our skirmish.

1058
01:34:44,059 --> 01:34:47,311
What signal do I give
when l' m on the boat...

1059
01:34:47,479 --> 01:34:50,065
...and you' re waiting
with your men?

1060
01:34:51,650 --> 01:34:54,945
Jarrett will use the boat whistle
when Zack attacks...

1061
01:34:55,110 --> 01:34:59,281
...and when you want me,
just double that signal.

1062
01:34:59,449 --> 01:35:00,825
Simple.

1063
01:35:01,826 --> 01:35:06,290
This may just prove to be one
of the bloodiest arenas in history.

1064
01:35:16,006 --> 01:35:19,593
Gentlemen, tonight's opening
would not be possible...

1065
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,513
...without your help.

1066
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:26,268
IKeep in mind this is La Maison Rouge
not the Last Chance Saloon...

1067
01:35:26,434 --> 01:35:29,729
...and this will be a memorable night
for Galveston...

1068
01:35:29,896 --> 01:35:35,401
...and a profitable one for us.
Be on your best behavior.

1069
01:35:35,569 --> 01:35:38,946
It's very simple.
When in doubt, just smile.

1070
01:35:39,114 --> 01:35:41,742
If you' re in doubt,
call on Renee.

1071
01:35:41,909 --> 01:35:46,245
Renee has been appointed maitre
d'htel. That means " headwaiter."

1072
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:48,457
You all know what to do.

1073
01:35:48,624 --> 01:35:51,835
Mr. Jarrett would like to say
a few words.

1074
01:35:52,001 --> 01:35:57,673
Remember one thing. No rough stuff
unless you hear the whistle.

1075
01:35:57,883 --> 01:36:01,220
If it looks like trouble
with uninvited visitors...

1076
01:36:01,385 --> 01:36:04,555
...Angel will give two blasts
on the pipe. Right?

1077
01:36:05,724 --> 01:36:07,977
- Right.
- Then you go all out.

1078
01:36:08,142 --> 01:36:10,853
We must catch them
at the dock.

1079
01:36:11,021 --> 01:36:14,524
Have you got that straight?
Good luck to all of us.

1080
01:36:17,903 --> 01:36:22,032
Wait for the customers?
Do you really think there will be any?

1081
01:36:22,366 --> 01:36:25,536
If nothing else brings them out,
that dress will.

1082
01:36:25,910 --> 01:36:29,206
- You like it?
- Sure. I paid for it!

1083
01:36:29,373 --> 01:36:31,499
They're coming, Mr. Jarrett!

1084
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:35,878
All right, men. Places.

1085
01:36:37,005 --> 01:36:39,675
I guess we all understand that?

1086
01:36:53,146 --> 01:36:54,898
Look at all them pigeons.

1087
01:36:55,064 --> 01:36:58,026
Don't shoot until the green
on their money shows.

1088
01:36:58,275 --> 01:37:00,487
- Here we go, Prince George.
- Yes, sir!

1089
01:37:00,654 --> 01:37:02,821
All right, the show is on.

1090
01:37:04,616 --> 01:37:06,869
Isn't this wonderful, Henry?

1091
01:37:24,176 --> 01:37:26,638
This Jarrett's a clever fellow.!

1092
01:37:33,644 --> 01:37:36,982
So that's the notorious
Maxine Richter.

1093
01:37:37,149 --> 01:37:38,816
Max, to her friends.

1094
01:38:05,509 --> 01:38:10,474
Do you think Zack Thomas will let
Jarrett get away with it?

1095
01:38:23,277 --> 01:38:28,533
I see we are honored by some
of the oldest families in Galveston.

1096
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:30,828
And by some
of the youngest wives.

1097
01:38:42,297 --> 01:38:46,133
Mr. and Mrs. Winthrop T rowbridge.

1098
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,814
Mr. and Mrs. Harvey Burden!

1099
01:39:09,408 --> 01:39:11,869
- Good evening.
- Mr. Jarrett.

1100
01:39:12,036 --> 01:39:15,830
It's a pleasure to welcome
you both.

1101
01:39:15,998 --> 01:39:20,836
- Mr. Burden.
- We' re having more fun.

1102
01:39:21,253 --> 01:39:24,755
Very gratifying.
Very gratifying indeed.

1103
01:39:34,598 --> 01:39:38,479
Come along, Evelyn.
I see some friends.

1104
01:39:41,648 --> 01:39:42,815
Deal, deal, deal.

1105
01:39:43,066 --> 01:39:44,483
Pay 18.

1106
01:39:45,777 --> 01:39:48,112
Thank you.

1107
01:39:49,948 --> 01:39:54,077
- Credit these to my account.
- Yes, Mr. Godfrey.

1108
01:39:54,244 --> 01:39:57,622
Ladies, shall we?
How about that?

1109
01:40:01,918 --> 01:40:04,378
That's right, Arthur Godfrey.

1110
01:40:16,975 --> 01:40:20,104
Presenting Madame Elya Carlson!

1111
01:40:20,436 --> 01:40:23,857
- Stop staring, William.
- Who's staring?

1112
01:40:25,691 --> 01:40:29,737
What an entrance. Look at those
diamonds. They look real.

1113
01:40:30,155 --> 01:40:33,283
- Quite a sight, Max?
- lf you like the type.

1114
01:40:33,449 --> 01:40:35,660
Oh, it takes all kinds--

1115
01:40:36,661 --> 01:40:40,247
If Elya's here, then Zachariah
can't be far behind.

1116
01:40:41,458 --> 01:40:42,584
Hey, Boss.

1117
01:40:42,751 --> 01:40:43,917
Boss.

1118
01:40:45,670 --> 01:40:49,256
They' re here, they' re here.
Well, come on.

1119
01:40:54,012 --> 01:40:58,057
Mr. and Mrs. Jacques Byrnes.

1120
01:41:12,739 --> 01:41:16,367
- You be ready when I tell you.
- You bet.

1121
01:41:18,620 --> 01:41:20,871
Maestro, please.

1122
01:41:21,623 --> 01:41:25,167
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please?

1123
01:41:26,003 --> 01:41:29,047
Miss Maxine will say a few words.

1124
01:41:38,055 --> 01:41:42,894
Ladies and gentlemen, some visitors
are about to drop in unexpectedly.

1125
01:41:43,187 --> 01:41:48,148
Mr. Jarrett will meet them on the dock
and explain that we are full.

1126
01:41:48,316 --> 01:41:52,988
It might take some convincing.
But no one here will be harmed.

1127
01:41:53,488 --> 01:41:55,990
In the meantime, have fun.

1128
01:41:56,158 --> 01:41:59,118
We have spared no expense to make
La Maison Rouge...

1129
01:41:59,286 --> 01:42:01,914
...your pleasure home away from home.

1130
01:42:02,414 --> 01:42:06,750
And if you'll just continue to enjoy
yourself...

1131
01:42:06,917 --> 01:42:10,339
...Mr. Jarrett will rejoin us shortly.

1132
01:42:10,756 --> 01:42:15,302
Please, be our guests, drink up.
Maestro.

1133
01:42:22,892 --> 01:42:24,353
Men, let's go.

1134
01:42:37,241 --> 01:42:40,536
Come on. Hustle it up.
Everybody, let's go.

1135
01:43:03,976 --> 01:43:06,437
Oh, it's Zack Thomas.

1136
01:43:08,146 --> 01:43:10,148
Men, get into position.

1137
01:43:10,314 --> 01:43:14,945
- I hope Jarrett knows what he's doing.
- Just like we planned it.

1138
01:43:15,152 --> 01:43:17,696
Shape up, boys. Shape up.

1139
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:23,704
Don't start anything
unless Mr. Jarrett says so.

1140
01:43:25,996 --> 01:43:28,542
Good evening.
You have a reservation?

1141
01:43:28,959 --> 01:43:33,253
This boat was my idea.
We' re taking over as of now.

1142
01:43:33,921 --> 01:43:37,885
This is opening night.
By the time your men and my men...

1143
01:43:38,050 --> 01:43:41,637
...figure out who's taking over,
nothing will be left.

1144
01:43:41,847 --> 01:43:45,058
If the boat is wrecked
and a customer gets hurt....

1145
01:43:45,726 --> 01:43:49,813
You mean there'll be no more gold
mine. What do you suggest?

1146
01:43:49,979 --> 01:43:53,649
I don't like to louse up
a new sporting jacket, but...

1147
01:43:53,816 --> 01:43:58,404
...maybe you and I could settle
this between us. Winner take all.

1148
01:43:58,572 --> 01:44:02,409
I got more men.
You' re trying to even up the odds.

1149
01:44:02,910 --> 01:44:07,747
Maybe you were man enough
to bet on yourself for a change.

1150
01:44:09,332 --> 01:44:10,833
Want to show off, huh?

1151
01:44:12,669 --> 01:44:14,044
And you don't, huh?

1152
01:44:15,923 --> 01:44:17,798
Well, how about it?

1153
01:44:26,057 --> 01:44:28,352
Don't look for no favors, Joe.

1154
01:44:31,145 --> 01:44:35,734
- Don't let him get away with that!
- That's just not cricket.

1155
01:44:36,483 --> 01:44:39,528
I said, don't look for no favors.

1156
01:44:39,695 --> 01:44:44,200
The one who's on his feet
when this is over wins it all.

1157
01:44:44,409 --> 01:44:48,370
Everything? Gift-wrapped,
everything. Winner take all.

1158
01:44:48,537 --> 01:44:52,334
Everybody out of it.
Just Zack and me.

1159
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:54,293
Everybody out.

1160
01:44:54,461 --> 01:44:57,379
All of you.
And you too, and you too.

1161
01:45:37,545 --> 01:45:38,755
Hold it!

1162
01:45:39,882 --> 01:45:42,843
Stay here until we hear
that whistle.

1163
01:45:43,259 --> 01:45:46,096
You three, and you three,
stay with me.

1164
01:45:56,523 --> 01:45:59,109
Wait a minute!
You heard what he said.

1165
01:45:59,316 --> 01:46:03,445
We'll wait and see
who'll come out upright!

1166
01:46:04,197 --> 01:46:07,074
- What did you say?
- I said upright!

1167
01:46:23,299 --> 01:46:24,635
Hold it.

1168
01:46:25,636 --> 01:46:26,969
Hold, hold.

1169
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:32,725
That dirty rat Burden!

1170
01:46:33,225 --> 01:46:38,022
I know why he wouldn't give you
access to this dock!

1171
01:46:38,190 --> 01:46:43,152
He let the Spindrift sail empty
and then scuttled it.

1172
01:46:43,362 --> 01:46:46,115
He probably intends
to sell me my own cotton.

1173
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:49,201
Nice reliable fellow
to do business with.

1174
01:46:49,366 --> 01:46:55,164
I won't hand you Galveston on a silver
platter. You'll have to take it.

1175
01:46:55,332 --> 01:46:59,710
- Come on in, Max.
- I won't go for that old joke.

1176
01:46:59,877 --> 01:47:04,465
No, Zack.
I really didn't think you would.

1177
01:47:04,632 --> 01:47:07,844
Now, this fight has rules.

1178
01:47:08,093 --> 01:47:10,846
I'm here to break the rules.

1179
01:47:11,014 --> 01:47:12,974
Why not?
You got the gun.

1180
01:47:19,646 --> 01:47:21,231
All right, let's go.

1181
01:47:22,691 --> 01:47:26,029
Remember!
Zack Thomas belongs to me.

1182
01:47:32,618 --> 01:47:34,371
Well, if I have to die...

1183
01:47:34,580 --> 01:47:38,541
...I prefer being killed by the hand
of a beautiful woman.

1184
01:47:38,708 --> 01:47:43,087
If you're not careful, my darling,
you might have your wish.

1185
01:47:43,255 --> 01:47:44,506
Honey!

1186
01:47:45,882 --> 01:47:47,383
Not yet.

1187
01:47:52,181 --> 01:47:55,434
Grown men acting like
little schoolboys.

1188
01:47:57,268 --> 01:48:01,732
I suggest you both become partners
in everything, including cotton.

1189
01:48:01,897 --> 01:48:03,899
I don't like partners.

1190
01:48:04,192 --> 01:48:06,361
Hey, boss!
They're coming.

1191
01:48:06,527 --> 01:48:08,989
Harvey Burden's men.
Matson is leading them!

1192
01:48:09,154 --> 01:48:10,197
How many?

1193
01:48:10,365 --> 01:48:13,367
- About a couple of thousand.
- How many?

1194
01:48:13,784 --> 01:48:15,494
At least 200.

1195
01:48:17,496 --> 01:48:18,832
Partners?

1196
01:48:21,877 --> 01:48:24,295
- Partners.
- Welcome, partner.

1197
01:48:24,837 --> 01:48:26,422
Partners.

1198
01:48:32,971 --> 01:48:34,764
All right, listen to me.

1199
01:48:34,932 --> 01:48:39,477
Jarrett and I are partners.
That puts us all together.

1200
01:48:39,645 --> 01:48:42,604
Let's deploy and protect the boat.

1201
01:48:54,950 --> 01:48:57,578
Come on, ladies.
Andiamo, andiamo.

1202
01:49:01,458 --> 01:49:03,459
What's the matter with you?

1203
01:49:04,376 --> 01:49:08,631
You heard him. You and I'll
fight together now, Chad.

1204
01:49:08,799 --> 01:49:11,969
- Against who?
- Against them, that's who!

1205
01:49:12,176 --> 01:49:15,304
That don't seem right,
fighting together. Why?

1206
01:49:15,471 --> 01:49:18,851
Why? Because they are the bad guys,
that's why!

1207
01:49:19,016 --> 01:49:23,771
- Ain't we the bad guys?
- No, we're the good guys!

1208
01:49:24,730 --> 01:49:26,191
Let's go!

1209
01:49:36,577 --> 01:49:40,496
- l' m frightened, Sam.
- We'll stay and see the fun.

1210
01:49:40,664 --> 01:49:43,541
Ladies, everything'll turn out fine.

1211
01:49:43,708 --> 01:49:45,626
He's got an army with him.

1212
01:49:49,713 --> 01:49:52,466
Don't be afraid
to use them torches.

1213
01:49:53,176 --> 01:49:57,680
- This'll be some bonfire.
- Get set, men. Get ready, come on.

1214
01:50:01,060 --> 01:50:02,978
All right, let's go.

1215
01:50:04,437 --> 01:50:06,648
Don't let those rats
on the boat.

1216
01:50:06,815 --> 01:50:11,235
Watch the torches,
they may try to burn it down.

1217
01:50:11,568 --> 01:50:13,989
All right, let's get them.

1218
01:50:27,586 --> 01:50:29,461
My eyes!

1219
01:50:42,643 --> 01:50:44,269
Keep them off the boat!

1220
01:50:44,602 --> 01:50:46,771
I'll take care of them, boss.

1221
01:50:48,605 --> 01:50:50,900
You ain't taking care of me.

1222
01:51:03,371 --> 01:51:05,915
- Looking for somebody?
- Matson...

1223
01:51:06,083 --> 01:51:10,337
...I feel better
when I know what he's doing.

1224
01:51:10,711 --> 01:51:11,712
Me too!

1225
01:51:17,552 --> 01:51:19,638
Get that daring young man.

1226
01:51:35,821 --> 01:51:37,864
- Seen Matson?
- Not yet.

1227
01:51:46,163 --> 01:51:50,292
I've been thinking.
You' re liable to blow Burden up, too.

1228
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:54,131
He wants this boat blown up.
I can't help it if he's on board.

1229
01:51:54,296 --> 01:51:55,422
Don't think.

1230
01:51:57,925 --> 01:52:00,094
Wait for me,
you understand?

1231
01:52:45,766 --> 01:52:48,517
It's Matson.
Up there on the wheel.

1232
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:11,082
All right, Mr. Matson.
It's your deal.

1233
01:53:44,199 --> 01:53:46,118
Looks like the water's on fire.

1234
01:53:46,618 --> 01:53:49,955
Because he's arranging
that deal with the devil.

1235
01:53:50,121 --> 01:53:52,916
I'm laying eight to five
he doesn't make it back.

1236
01:53:57,378 --> 01:53:59,463
Come along with us,
Mr. Burden.

1237
01:53:59,630 --> 01:54:02,426
The U.S. Marshal
would like to see you.

1238
01:54:02,633 --> 01:54:05,470
Some misunderstanding
about the Spindrift.

1239
01:54:05,637 --> 01:54:07,598
Probably nothing at all.

1240
01:54:08,889 --> 01:54:13,144
- Harv!
- Don't call me "Harv"!

1241
01:54:13,937 --> 01:54:16,230
Ready.

1242
01:54:19,817 --> 01:54:22,821
You're going to treasure
this picture.

1243
01:54:22,987 --> 01:54:28,452
And you' re lucky to have married
two such lovely, innocent girls.

1244
01:54:35,792 --> 01:54:39,211
- Don't tell me how to spell!
- I was only trying to help.

1245
01:54:39,379 --> 01:54:41,465
I know how to spell!

1246
01:54:42,214 --> 01:54:44,467
With four for T exas in the mood...

1247
01:54:44,676 --> 01:54:47,511
...they'll have themselves
a real fine brood.

1248
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:50,975
- Like me?
- Yes, like you.

1249
01:54:51,140 --> 01:54:54,645
Good guys always get married
and live happily ever after.

1250
01:54:54,810 --> 01:54:59,733
If it don 't turn out too good,
Zack and me figure we can light out.

1251
01:54:59,898 --> 01:55:02,693
And, oh yeah,
this is the end.
