1
00:02:20,005 --> 00:02:22,383
Get off the streets!
They're coming!

2
00:02:25,886 --> 00:02:28,286
I see them, Miss Jessie.
They're here.

3
00:03:17,312 --> 00:03:19,362
- Abe.
- Take care of the horses.

4
00:03:32,453 --> 00:03:36,999
Where are the men to stop them?
Where are the men to help Thomson?

5
00:03:39,418 --> 00:03:41,918
I'd like to see them
all burn in hell.

6
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:10,532
Thomson!

7
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:14,286
Thomson, come out of there.

8
00:04:16,205 --> 00:04:19,374
Roy, want me to go with you?

9
00:04:23,545 --> 00:04:24,588
No, thanks.

10
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:28,966
This town may not need a deputy,
but it sure needs a fireman.

11
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:33,931
I'm here to talk about my man.
It's death, murder.

12
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:37,039
You've murdered too many
good men, Thomson.

13
00:04:37,226 --> 00:04:41,021
Come out into the street.
Or are you a coward?

14
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,290
A back-shooting coward
who won't face me!

15
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:03,437
Going for a ride,
sheriff?

16
00:06:07,357 --> 00:06:09,484
Come on, let's give him a hand.

17
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:14,489
That's a boy, good boy.

18
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,743
Oh, Sheriff.

19
00:06:18,994 --> 00:06:22,944
Come on, you're all dirty.
You've got to practice your mounting.

20
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:27,002
Look, here's a present for you.
Come on, get him up.

21
00:06:28,754 --> 00:06:31,214
Let's give him a guard of honour.

22
00:07:15,842 --> 00:07:19,095
I'm old.
Much too old.

23
00:07:21,723 --> 00:07:25,393
Warlock beats me.
Got to get out of this town.

24
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:29,439
- Got to get out.
- Too late.

25
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,609
Too late for us all.

26
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:03,014
- Come on, Curley.
- I can't find Johnny.

27
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:09,938
Where's my horse...?

28
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:13,608
Johnny!

29
00:08:14,651 --> 00:08:18,405
- Wake up, Johnny.
- No, let me sleep.

30
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,908
You're a fine example
of a big brother.

31
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:25,203
- I want to feel good...
- Yeah, sure. Come on.

32
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,872
Attaboy, Billy, help me.

33
00:08:29,082 --> 00:08:32,376
- Help me to feel good.
- I can't figure you, Johnny.

34
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:34,127
I swear I can't figure you.

35
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:38,508
Pony Benner!
Come on, let's go, Pony.

36
00:08:40,635 --> 00:08:44,347
- Hurry up, I've got to go.
- If you'll just give me time.

37
00:08:44,681 --> 00:08:47,392
It'll do no good.
You're the ugliest.

38
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,772
Come on.

39
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:56,234
Look what he did.

40
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,528
Look what he did.

41
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:04,784
Come on, Pony, let's go.

42
00:09:35,857 --> 00:09:38,485
Johnny!
We've got to go.

43
00:10:02,091 --> 00:10:04,594
Thomson didn't stand a prayer,
did he?

44
00:10:06,596 --> 00:10:08,555
- Did he, Abe?
- Johnny, you're drunk.

45
00:10:08,556 --> 00:10:12,769
Were Cade and Benner supposed to
shoot him before or after he drew?

46
00:10:13,353 --> 00:10:17,503
They had orders to shoot only if
there was interference from outside.

47
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:22,028
From who? No man in Warlock
would dare come against you.

48
00:10:22,195 --> 00:10:25,989
No? There's getting to be a lot more.
New ones all the time.

49
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,784
I've got to keep letting them
know I was here first.

50
00:10:28,785 --> 00:10:32,162
How long does that give you
the right to run things your way?

51
00:10:32,163 --> 00:10:34,999
- As long as I want.
- Yeah...

52
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,337
All I'm saying is,
when you stand to win,

53
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,714
you've got to be able
to stand to lose too.

54
00:10:42,715 --> 00:10:45,815
The time has come to take up arms
in our defence.

55
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:49,430
Last night was the fourth time
in a month.

56
00:10:49,597 --> 00:10:52,147
Driven to cover by them
murdering cowboys.

57
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,852
We put our faith in Thomson
and he ran.

58
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:56,469
While everyone else hid.

59
00:10:57,105 --> 00:11:00,655
An excellent point, Miss Jessie.
It's time to stop hiding.

60
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:05,042
We've got them outnumbered 5 to 1.
We've got to fight them with arms.

61
00:11:05,113 --> 00:11:07,072
At the risk of losing our own lives?

62
00:11:07,073 --> 00:11:10,223
I have ore I have to deliver
from my silver mines.

63
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:13,788
Yet my miners are terrorised,
my wagons wrecked.

64
00:11:13,955 --> 00:11:17,582
We can't let this anarchism, murder
and violence destroy Warlock,

65
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,483
even at the risk of our lives.

66
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:22,129
I say we arm ourselves
and stand and fight.

67
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,464
That's the only way
and you all know it.

68
00:11:24,465 --> 00:11:27,343
Wrong, wrong, wrong.
All wrong.

69
00:11:27,844 --> 00:11:31,594
You're using anarchy and murder
to prevent anarchy and murder.

70
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:34,016
You're doing the same thing
as McQuown.

71
00:11:34,017 --> 00:11:37,812
- What's the alternative, Judge?
- Law and order.

72
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:41,148
There is one other way,
we can hire our own marshal.

73
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:43,817
- Lots of towns have done it.
- We can't hire a marshal.

74
00:11:43,818 --> 00:11:47,739
There's no such position here,
we're not legally a town.

75
00:11:48,448 --> 00:11:52,117
He'd be just as much a marshal
as you are ajudge, Mr. Holloway.

76
00:11:52,118 --> 00:11:56,748
On acceptance, as you put it. You'd
act for the citizens of Warlock.

77
00:11:56,914 --> 00:11:59,764
The only way to handle this
is the legal way.

78
00:12:00,293 --> 00:12:02,086
Send for Sheriff Keller.

79
00:12:02,253 --> 00:12:04,463
What'll he do?
Send another Thomson?

80
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:06,299
Keller's 50 miles away.

81
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:10,766
He might as well be a thousand,
for all the times he comes down here.

82
00:12:11,262 --> 00:12:13,222
I say we try our own marshal.

83
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:21,064
This looks like a happy gathering.
Something we should know about?

84
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:25,485
Just foolish committee talk.
Something I can do for you?

85
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,406
With all this foolish committee talk,
half the stores in town are closed.

86
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,243
It is supply day at San Pablo,
Mr. Richardson.

87
00:12:35,369 --> 00:12:39,749
Let's see, a half dozen
sacks of flour...

88
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,966
Give me a few minutes, Curley,
and I'll be open.

89
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:47,965
Yes, sir, Mr. Richardson.

90
00:12:48,674 --> 00:12:52,135
We wouldn't think of breaking up
such an important meeting.

91
00:12:52,136 --> 00:12:55,223
I tell you what,
we'll wait outside.

92
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:57,517
Pony, Johnny and me.

93
00:13:19,622 --> 00:13:21,165
Benner killed our barber.

94
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,941
An hour ago, we were all
very indignant about that.

95
00:13:24,961 --> 00:13:29,006
Yet, there he stood,
and none of us did anything.

96
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,100
All right, Henry.
You've made your point.

97
00:13:33,135 --> 00:13:35,387
But who are you going to get
for your marshal?

98
00:13:35,388 --> 00:13:37,765
I have a man in mind.
Clay Blaisdell.

99
00:13:37,932 --> 00:13:40,141
Serving at present
as marshal in Port James.

100
00:13:40,142 --> 00:13:44,105
You mean, vigilante, gambler,
gunman.

101
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:47,400
I'm sure we've all
heard about him.

102
00:13:48,109 --> 00:13:51,659
There's even been a book
written about him by Kalib Bane.

103
00:13:52,154 --> 00:13:55,704
Mr. Bane attributes all manner
of courage to Mr. Blaisdell.

104
00:13:56,617 --> 00:13:59,828
He presented him with a pair of
gold Colts for his brave deeds.

105
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:02,206
I saw Blaisdell once,
in Port James.

106
00:14:02,707 --> 00:14:05,250
The day after he killed
big Ben Nicholson.

107
00:14:05,251 --> 00:14:10,381
Nicholson was a bad one.
Blaisdell deserved those colts.

108
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:17,263
Is this superhuman going to
subdue the savage beast

109
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,280
by the pure power of his eye,

110
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,440
or the menace of his six shooter,
or simply by his reputation?

111
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:25,419
None of those, Miss Jessie.

112
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:29,071
Blaisdell's only hope in Warlock
is to be lead-proof.

113
00:14:56,218 --> 00:14:57,720
There she is, Clay.

114
00:14:59,263 --> 00:15:00,514
Warlock.

115
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:03,232
A pretty enough town.

116
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:06,187
Better than some I've seen.

117
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:11,525
- Just for a short stay.
- We'll find out.

118
00:15:20,493 --> 00:15:22,870
They're coming!
They're coming!

119
00:15:24,872 --> 00:15:26,624
I saw them!
They're coming!

120
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,919
I saw them!
They're coming!

121
00:15:33,506 --> 00:15:35,173
Well, Jessie.
There he comes,

122
00:15:35,174 --> 00:15:39,261
gold handled Colts and all.
This is a real beginning for Warlock.

123
00:16:07,915 --> 00:16:10,709
- He's here.
- And I'm going.

124
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:14,505
- I've sold out to Morgan.
- I guess you have.

125
00:16:15,756 --> 00:16:18,133
I wonder if we all have.

126
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:28,726
Morning, Mr. Blaisdell.

127
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:31,856
Blaisdell,
I'm Judge Holloway.

128
00:16:32,565 --> 00:16:36,652
- I didn't know Warlock had ajudge.
- On acceptance only.

129
00:16:36,944 --> 00:16:41,448
Same way you're a marshal.
I want to get a good look at you.

130
00:16:42,074 --> 00:16:45,369
- They say you're a decent man.
- I thank you.

131
00:16:45,536 --> 00:16:47,328
But it's not enough to be decent

132
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:51,458
where you have to kill men
and judge which men to kill,

133
00:16:52,126 --> 00:16:53,669
the word is the law.

134
00:16:54,628 --> 00:16:57,828
I guess I'll be the law, Judge,
on your acceptance.

135
00:16:58,048 --> 00:17:01,302
Not on mine.
I don't accept you.

136
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:06,056
Any man who's got himself set
over others

137
00:17:06,265 --> 00:17:09,018
and isn't responsible
to something bigger

138
00:17:09,184 --> 00:17:11,269
- Is a murdering swine.
- Shut up, Judge.

139
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,896
There's something bigger than
all men, and that's the law!

140
00:17:13,897 --> 00:17:15,691
Do you hear me? The law!

141
00:17:16,442 --> 00:17:19,695
- A nice welcome.
- Better than some I've seen.

142
00:17:24,825 --> 00:17:27,375
As I understand it,
I have full authority

143
00:17:28,203 --> 00:17:30,371
accountable to you,
the citizens' committee.

144
00:17:30,372 --> 00:17:34,293
- Yes, accountable to us.
- That's what I said, Mr. Petrix.

145
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:39,380
I'll carry out my duties in ways
best fitted to the job,

146
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:41,383
the aim being public safety.

147
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,969
Peace and safety,
that's our aim.

148
00:17:44,678 --> 00:17:48,348
You won't be surprised then,
if I have to post men out of town.

149
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:51,559
As a last resort, in the case
of real trouble makers,

150
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,937
they'll be informed they come
into town at the risk of their lives.

151
00:17:54,938 --> 00:17:58,988
I suggest you start by posting
every one of the San Pablo cowboys.

152
00:17:59,318 --> 00:18:02,218
Just a minute, Buck.
All those boys ain't bad.

153
00:18:02,404 --> 00:18:05,504
I like Curley Burne and Billy Gannon,
among others.

154
00:18:05,532 --> 00:18:06,866
It's McQuown and Benner...

155
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:11,080
Mr. Skinner and Mr. Slavin,
you'll let that be my choice.

156
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:15,041
There are one or two real trouble
makers. If I give you their names...

157
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:17,460
He's not your private marshal,
Mr. McDonald.

158
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:20,839
Also my choice,
Mr. McDonald.

159
00:18:21,006 --> 00:18:22,841
One other thing.

160
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:26,219
Some of the town folk have been
wondering about Mr. Morgan

161
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,620
whether he'll have any
official status.

162
00:18:29,014 --> 00:18:30,057
May I see that?

163
00:18:37,523 --> 00:18:39,023
Tom Morgan is my friend.

164
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:41,466
We've been friends
for over ten years.

165
00:18:42,986 --> 00:18:47,336
I've never known him commit an evil
act. You'll have to take my word.

166
00:18:47,574 --> 00:18:51,912
I started working for him as a faro
dealer. I still do on occasion.

167
00:18:52,121 --> 00:18:55,207
- Faro dealer?
- Yes.

168
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,835
We're partners.

169
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,382
The 400 dollars I get from you
would hardly pay for my ammunition.

170
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:08,850
Fortunately, as a faro dealer, I'm
an attraction. Things work out well.

171
00:19:09,138 --> 00:19:11,639
I presume by that you mean
that people come

172
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,940
hoping to see you
shoot someone dead.

173
00:19:14,143 --> 00:19:17,693
- You don't approve of me, Miss...
- Marlow. Jessie Marlow.

174
00:19:17,729 --> 00:19:20,629
It really doesn't matter.
I'm in the minority.

175
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:23,819
You won't be in the minority
very long.

176
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:26,594
People generally begin to resent me.

177
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:29,797
I don't mind,
it's part of the job.

178
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:32,675
- I let me assure you...
- It will happen.

179
00:19:33,704 --> 00:19:36,854
I come here as your salvation
on a very high wage.

180
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:41,378
I establish order,
ride roughshod over offenders.

181
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:45,721
At first, you're pleased because
there's less trouble.

182
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:48,308
Then, a strange thing happens.

183
00:19:48,802 --> 00:19:52,848
You begin to feel I'm too powerful,
you begin to fear me.

184
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:55,684
Not me,
but what I am.

185
00:19:56,226 --> 00:20:00,326
When that happens, we'll have had
full satisfaction from one another

186
00:20:01,023 --> 00:20:02,690
and it'll be time for me to leave.

187
00:20:02,691 --> 00:20:06,641
You speak as though from experience.
Has this happened many times?

188
00:20:07,946 --> 00:20:09,946
Yes, ma'am.
In a lot of towns.

189
00:20:10,949 --> 00:20:12,826
Clay, aren't you finished yet?

190
00:20:14,202 --> 00:20:16,913
- Come on up.
- Excuse me.

191
00:20:18,498 --> 00:20:20,048
We might as well adjourn.

192
00:20:24,588 --> 00:20:27,938
They can't hold guns,
but they sure can hold meetings.

193
00:20:29,092 --> 00:20:30,302
What's that?

194
00:20:31,595 --> 00:20:34,181
The black rattle snake
of Port James.

195
00:20:35,432 --> 00:20:37,309
That's a very poetic image.

196
00:20:40,187 --> 00:20:42,537
Come on, I'll show you
your quarters.

197
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:46,652
Murch, start cleaning up
downstairs.

198
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:47,819
All right.

199
00:20:49,363 --> 00:20:52,824
Well?
This'll fix up fine.

200
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,786
First, we get rid
of all this trash.

201
00:20:55,952 --> 00:20:59,956
Look, we each have a bedroom.
I'll fix this up real fancy.

202
00:21:00,248 --> 00:21:01,548
Don't work too hard.

203
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:05,933
There's only one bunch of gangsters,
the McQuowns. Won't take too long.

204
00:21:06,588 --> 00:21:10,509
These aren't just tuners
like up in Port James.

205
00:21:11,593 --> 00:21:13,177
I hear this is a bad bunch.

206
00:21:13,178 --> 00:21:15,878
In any case, let's drink
to the next town.

207
00:21:16,139 --> 00:21:20,018
To this one, first, and a successful
meeting with the McQuowns.

208
00:21:20,352 --> 00:21:21,752
The sooner, the better.

209
00:22:12,487 --> 00:22:13,780
Get back to work.

210
00:22:43,768 --> 00:22:45,618
- Evening.
- It is, isn't it?

211
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:49,149
Some of McQuown's boys
just came in.

212
00:22:50,191 --> 00:22:53,028
Is that so?
McQuown come himself?

213
00:22:53,194 --> 00:22:56,615
Not yet. I've been doing
a little investigating.

214
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,995
See that big fella?
That's Jack Cade.

215
00:23:02,162 --> 00:23:05,247
Number two to McQuown.
Next to him is Chet Haggin.

216
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:08,348
The little sneaky one on the right
is Pony Benner.

217
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,379
Jack Cade is supposed to be
the meanest.

218
00:23:12,422 --> 00:23:15,925
- I see you added something.
- I wondered when you'd notice.

219
00:23:15,926 --> 00:23:19,876
She came in the last batch from
San Francisco, with those drapes.

220
00:23:20,013 --> 00:23:24,413
I held out because I didn't know if
you were big enough to handle her.

221
00:23:24,601 --> 00:23:27,771
Very pretty.
I wonder if McQuown's coming in.

222
00:23:27,979 --> 00:23:31,629
Don't worry about McQuown.
He'll never come up against you.

223
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:35,433
His style is to play with
a backshooter. Watch out for Cade.

224
00:23:36,363 --> 00:23:37,663
You said that before.

225
00:23:38,615 --> 00:23:40,866
Want me to handle
some of the action?

226
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:44,667
I'll play it my way, Morgan.
See if they don't have to too.

227
00:23:46,122 --> 00:23:48,832
It'll help to put on
your gold handled pair.

228
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,877
There'll be a lot disappointed
if they don't see them flash.

229
00:23:51,878 --> 00:23:54,714
They're for Sundays.
This is a work day.

230
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,633
See you downstairs.

231
00:23:58,051 --> 00:24:00,637
- I'm ready.
- All right.

232
00:24:00,804 --> 00:24:03,354
Let's have a drink
in the French Palace.

233
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,309
Maybe that marshal
will join us.

234
00:24:08,645 --> 00:24:11,230
- Let's go get him.
- Take it easy, Billy.

235
00:24:11,231 --> 00:24:12,899
Let's go, Johnny.

236
00:24:14,818 --> 00:24:16,986
Murch, they're coming.

237
00:24:17,987 --> 00:24:20,531
Watch for backshooters.
Anyone moves, you let go.

238
00:24:20,532 --> 00:24:22,616
With this?
It'll mash half the place.

239
00:24:22,617 --> 00:24:26,617
Anyone moves on Clay's back, let go.
I don't care who you mash.

240
00:24:26,621 --> 00:24:27,664
All right.

241
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:32,307
- What will Blaisdell say?
- Nothing, if he's dead.

242
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:46,391
Evening, Mr. McQuown.
Gentlemen, the place is yours.

243
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:50,228
- Nice place.
- Thank you.

244
00:24:50,437 --> 00:24:52,438
A drink for Mr. McQuown
and his friends.

245
00:24:52,439 --> 00:24:55,733
- Hope you enjoy yourselves.
- We will.

246
00:25:19,757 --> 00:25:22,968
Blaisdell will be half way back
to Port James by now.

247
00:25:22,969 --> 00:25:27,432
- Don't you wish it, Pony?
- This is a different breed of horse.

248
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:30,643
This will be a real good one.

249
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:34,647
Hey Billy, maybe you, me,
Curley and Chet

250
00:25:34,814 --> 00:25:36,691
can have a game of cards.

251
00:26:19,984 --> 00:26:21,110
Whisky.

252
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:51,015
Mr. Marshal.

253
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:59,273
I wonder,
could I make a little complaint.

254
00:27:00,817 --> 00:27:04,404
I guess it's up to me.

255
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:06,196
There's just been a heap
of fussing about it,

256
00:27:06,197 --> 00:27:09,909
but it seems like folks have
gone and left it up to me.

257
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:14,580
It's them gold handles of yours,
Marshal.

258
00:27:16,582 --> 00:27:21,754
I hope you ain't wearing them.
They're awfully hard on a man's eye.

259
00:27:24,424 --> 00:27:27,969
I'm just speaking for myself.

260
00:27:29,887 --> 00:27:33,687
I'd hate to get a case of eye strain
from them gold handles.

261
00:27:33,766 --> 00:27:36,352
They're so bright
in the sun and all...

262
00:27:38,354 --> 00:27:42,275
A man just ain't much use
without his eyes.

263
00:27:43,901 --> 00:27:47,901
And I hear there've been an awful
lot strained in Warlock lately.

264
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,090
You could close your eyes.

265
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:56,164
I'd just look foolish.

266
00:27:56,581 --> 00:28:01,711
I'd bump all over the place, trying
to get around with my eyes closed.

267
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,258
Marshal, por favor,
couldn't you just

268
00:28:07,425 --> 00:28:12,388
not polish the handles so bright
rubbing on them, like they say?

269
00:28:14,182 --> 00:28:18,519
I guess I might do that,
if things felt right in town here.

270
00:28:22,273 --> 00:28:23,524
Marshal,

271
00:28:25,776 --> 00:28:29,238
what if somebody painted
them handles black for you?

272
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:32,783
That might do...

273
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,680
But, who's to do it?

274
00:29:11,197 --> 00:29:12,240
McQuown.

275
00:29:14,742 --> 00:29:15,785
McQuown.

276
00:29:24,585 --> 00:29:28,485
McQuown, my name's Blaisdell,
I'm hired to keep the peace here.

277
00:29:28,673 --> 00:29:32,323
I'm going to lay down two things
and back up all the way.

278
00:29:32,468 --> 00:29:33,818
The first one's this.

279
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:38,520
Any man starts a shooting scrape,
I'll kill, unless he kills me first.

280
00:29:40,726 --> 00:29:44,226
Number two is what the citizen's
committee has agreed to.

281
00:29:44,772 --> 00:29:48,572
If a man makes trouble, he'll
see himself posted out of town.

282
00:29:49,652 --> 00:29:52,402
It's what some towns call
a white affidavit.

283
00:29:53,572 --> 00:29:58,244
It's backed by me. Any man posted
comes in, comes in against me.

284
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:02,929
That's all I've got to say,
McQuown.

285
00:30:14,176 --> 00:30:15,177
Blaisdell!

286
00:30:19,724 --> 00:30:22,024
- Go for your arm, Blaisdell.
- Billy!

287
00:30:26,564 --> 00:30:29,191
- Go along, son.
- Let's go, Billy.

288
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,908
That wasn't so hard.

289
00:31:19,325 --> 00:31:21,125
I thought they'd never leave.

290
00:31:25,873 --> 00:31:30,419
You dirty yellow,
I'll cut that stinking...

291
00:31:30,586 --> 00:31:31,712
Stop it!

292
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:38,177
- Stop it!
- One day, I'll shoot that hand off.

293
00:31:38,636 --> 00:31:40,221
Stop it, Johnny.

294
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,640
Let's not stand around
squalling at each other.

295
00:31:43,641 --> 00:31:46,976
I knew about Cade, now I know about
you. You're both backshooters.

296
00:31:46,977 --> 00:31:49,979
That's enough.
It's bad enough we're running back

297
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,690
- Our tails between our legs
- I just want to make it plain.

298
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:53,901
Shut up, Johnny.

299
00:31:54,818 --> 00:31:56,237
Shut up.

300
00:32:10,084 --> 00:32:11,234
You coming, Johnny?

301
00:32:13,671 --> 00:32:14,755
No, Billy.

302
00:32:16,632 --> 00:32:18,759
I guess I'll be staying in town.

303
00:33:13,063 --> 00:33:16,150
- Afternoon, Mr. Gannon.
- Hello, Mr. Morgan.

304
00:33:16,775 --> 00:33:19,653
Seems like you and me
are social pariahs.

305
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,420
What do you mean?

306
00:33:22,448 --> 00:33:25,848
We're the only two in town
not invited to the wedding.

307
00:33:26,702 --> 00:33:30,539
- Yeah...
- Me, because I'm a no good gambler.

308
00:33:31,665 --> 00:33:34,585
You, because you're a no good
San Pabloite.

309
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:38,505
I'm not a San Pabloite,
not anymore.

310
00:33:39,715 --> 00:33:43,915
It's a pity they don't believe you.
Just as they don't believe me.

311
00:33:52,728 --> 00:33:56,273
- Weddings.
- You don't like them?

312
00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:01,069
Mr. Gannon,
we pretend to be free men.

313
00:34:01,904 --> 00:34:05,404
Yet, when conventionality
spreads herself out fold by fold,

314
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,120
we eagerly approach pretty misses
that bind us to domesticity.

315
00:34:11,413 --> 00:34:14,458
You read that in a book somewhere?

316
00:34:16,043 --> 00:34:17,961
I think I just made it up.

317
00:34:20,172 --> 00:34:24,635
What I'm trying to say is that
civilisation is stalking Warlock.

318
00:34:24,885 --> 00:34:26,303
Mr. Morgan.

319
00:34:27,387 --> 00:34:30,933
I'm Fen Jiggs.
Ed Hamilton sent me from Port James.

320
00:34:32,684 --> 00:34:33,685
Come inside.

321
00:34:44,988 --> 00:34:48,032
Maybe you gentlemen feel
things have improved in Warlock.

322
00:34:48,033 --> 00:34:50,868
- Maybe your safety is improved.
- It certainly has.

323
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:54,373
Not one drop of bloodshed
since the marshal took over.

324
00:34:54,581 --> 00:34:58,501
It ain't the same outside, I lost
a thousand stock in two months.

325
00:34:58,502 --> 00:35:02,547
I ain't holding McQuown responsible,
but he's shifting a lot of cattle.

326
00:35:02,548 --> 00:35:05,398
It's not only rustling,
there are road agents.

327
00:35:05,592 --> 00:35:08,345
I told my drivers
not to resist a hold up.

328
00:35:08,762 --> 00:35:11,098
I carry no shipments
of any value.

329
00:35:11,682 --> 00:35:14,892
Today's the last bank shipment,
I don't count on it getting through.

330
00:35:14,893 --> 00:35:17,395
I'm making no accusations,
but if I were marshal

331
00:35:17,396 --> 00:35:20,565
I'd get after a couple
of boys named Benner and Friendly.

332
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:21,732
What would you do with them?

333
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:26,905
Take them before ajury of trembling
fools that would let them off?

334
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,702
- Allow me, Miss Marlow.
- Thank you.

335
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:40,877
- May I join you?
- Of course.

336
00:35:42,587 --> 00:35:46,133
I enjoyed your playing
and your singing.

337
00:35:46,466 --> 00:35:49,553
- Thank you.
- You have a sensitive touch.

338
00:35:50,345 --> 00:35:52,145
My mother played the melodeon.

339
00:35:54,933 --> 00:35:57,936
Even killers and gunmen
have mothers, Miss Marlow.

340
00:35:58,228 --> 00:36:01,398
- And you loved and respected her.
- Yes, ma'am.

341
00:36:06,653 --> 00:36:07,779
Mr. Blaisdell.

342
00:36:09,823 --> 00:36:13,273
- I think I owe you an apology.
- What for, Miss Marlow?

343
00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:18,540
Dr. Wagner told me what you did
against McQuown and his men.

344
00:36:19,416 --> 00:36:22,418
You've done what nobody else
even came close to doing,

345
00:36:22,419 --> 00:36:23,711
without firing a shot.

346
00:36:23,712 --> 00:36:28,012
I did it only to convince you I'm not
the wickedest man in the west.

347
00:36:29,676 --> 00:36:32,596
I respect that,
and I admire you for it.

348
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,558
My father hated violence.

349
00:36:37,184 --> 00:36:39,811
- He opened the mines, didn't he?
- Yes.

350
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:45,481
Anyway, Mr. Blaisdell,
will you accept my apology?

351
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,150
You see? It's happening.

352
00:36:47,903 --> 00:36:51,447
I warned you about that in
my first meeting with the committee.

353
00:36:51,448 --> 00:36:54,198
People changing their minds
about me, I mean.

354
00:36:54,367 --> 00:36:56,786
You said people would fear
and resent you.

355
00:36:56,787 --> 00:36:59,331
People that liked
and wanted me would,

356
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:01,781
people that disliked me
would...

357
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,586
Change, Miss Marlow,
it's inevitable.

358
00:37:05,587 --> 00:37:09,049
- But it goes both ways.
- Does that worry you?

359
00:37:09,508 --> 00:37:13,261
No, not at all.
It has compensations.

360
00:37:20,644 --> 00:37:23,104
- How many on the stage?
- Three.

361
00:37:24,064 --> 00:37:27,214
Her, him and the one
from the bank in Bright City.

362
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:32,259
There must be money in the box...
She could be in danger of a hold up.

363
00:37:32,697 --> 00:37:36,117
You better leave now.
And tell Ed thanks.

364
00:37:36,326 --> 00:37:37,701
I wasn't planning on going.

365
00:37:37,702 --> 00:37:41,402
Get a fresh horse at the stable,
tell them you work for me.

366
00:37:41,915 --> 00:37:42,958
Thanks, Morgan.

367
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:46,908
- Ed said you'd be pleased to hear.
- I am pleased.

368
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,597
Murch, have my horse saddled.

369
00:39:32,901 --> 00:39:33,985
Here it comes.

370
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,702
Reach!
Put that down.

371
00:40:31,543 --> 00:40:32,710
Box down.

372
00:40:39,926 --> 00:40:42,076
Let's see what the passengers have.

373
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,970
Calhoun!

374
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:31,686
Friendly!

375
00:42:12,727 --> 00:42:16,147
- Get the doc?
- Henry.

376
00:42:16,356 --> 00:42:19,776
- Get the doctor!
- Get the doctor!

377
00:42:30,036 --> 00:42:32,871
- What happened?
- Threw down on us on the road.

378
00:42:32,872 --> 00:42:36,042
Shot a passenger.
The team took off.

379
00:42:36,209 --> 00:42:38,086
One of them was Pony Benner.

380
00:42:38,252 --> 00:42:41,202
One was Pony Benner,
the other was Billy Gannon.

381
00:42:46,928 --> 00:42:49,096
If we ride to hit the river,
we can get them.

382
00:42:49,097 --> 00:42:51,181
Marshal, deputise me
and I'm your man.

383
00:42:51,182 --> 00:42:54,601
- I'll ride with you, marshal.
- Jack, get some horses ready.

384
00:42:54,602 --> 00:42:57,602
- There were two of them?
- Only Benner and Bill.

385
00:42:57,647 --> 00:42:59,023
There were three.

386
00:43:03,403 --> 00:43:08,157
- I only saw two.
- There was one up on the ridge.

387
00:43:08,533 --> 00:43:11,833
- The one that killed the big fella?
- What big fella?

388
00:43:12,537 --> 00:43:15,790
My friend's name was Nicholson,
Bob Nicholson.

389
00:43:16,207 --> 00:43:18,501
A brother to Ben Nicholson
of Texas.

390
00:43:20,837 --> 00:43:24,037
We had to let him lay
when the team took off wild.

391
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,925
- I'd like to go with you.
- Didn't you hear, Gannon?

392
00:43:26,926 --> 00:43:30,476
- One of them was your brother.
- I said I'd like to go.

393
00:43:30,555 --> 00:43:32,222
Ride out after the passenger.

394
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:35,473
- I'd rather not.
- Somebody has to, I'm asking you.

395
00:43:42,441 --> 00:43:45,641
Well, boys, let's go see
what San Pablo looks like.

396
00:43:56,706 --> 00:43:59,458
Welcome to Warlock, Miss...

397
00:44:50,176 --> 00:44:52,876
So you couldn't get along
without me, Lily?

398
00:44:57,224 --> 00:45:00,769
- You could've told me you were coming.
- Didn't you know?

399
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:04,231
- I'd have had a brass band out.
- Didn't you?

400
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:06,484
Didn't you?

401
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:25,451
Won't you come into my parlour?

402
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,765
Remind you of home, Lily?

403
00:45:35,054 --> 00:45:37,890
I was on the stage
when it was held up.

404
00:45:38,057 --> 00:45:42,937
- That must've been exciting.
- A man was killed.

405
00:45:43,104 --> 00:45:46,504
So I heard. Somebody said
he looked like a high roller.

406
00:45:46,565 --> 00:45:51,529
- He wasn't with you, was he, Lily?
- It was Ben Nicholson's brother.

407
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:58,890
I went more than 5000 miles
looking for Ben Nicholson's brother.

408
00:46:01,497 --> 00:46:02,665
Lily, Lily...

409
00:46:04,583 --> 00:46:06,627
How you run to those Nicholsons.

410
00:46:07,586 --> 00:46:09,736
Haven't you had enough
of killing?

411
00:46:10,464 --> 00:46:13,759
Not till I see Blaisdell
shot dead.

412
00:46:13,926 --> 00:46:17,426
Wherever he goes, I'll follow him
and see him shot down.

413
00:46:19,014 --> 00:46:21,714
For taking away the only
chance I ever had,

414
00:46:22,643 --> 00:46:25,393
and killing the only decent man
I ever knew.

415
00:46:25,938 --> 00:46:29,066
You have decent mixed up.

416
00:46:30,568 --> 00:46:34,418
There is one decent man,
but hell has turned you loose on him.

417
00:46:35,197 --> 00:46:37,247
Ben Nicholson
was a cheap gunman.

418
00:46:37,741 --> 00:46:40,791
He came after Clay, called him up
and drew first.

419
00:46:40,911 --> 00:46:42,746
You put Clay up to it.

420
00:46:43,998 --> 00:46:47,498
If you believe that,
you should get somebody to shoot me.

421
00:46:47,626 --> 00:46:51,839
There'd be no satisfaction
for me in that.

422
00:46:52,882 --> 00:46:57,469
You don't care about yourself,
but you do care about Clay.

423
00:46:59,013 --> 00:47:01,313
And when he'd dead
and in the dust,

424
00:47:01,348 --> 00:47:03,998
I'll look at you over his body
and laugh.

425
00:47:05,477 --> 00:47:07,438
Lily, Lily, Lily...

426
00:47:08,856 --> 00:47:10,506
You'd better leave Warlock.

427
00:47:11,108 --> 00:47:12,568
You'd like me to go.

428
00:47:14,904 --> 00:47:16,904
You'd give a lot, wouldn't you?

429
00:47:19,158 --> 00:47:22,658
I'd give a lot more to have you
come back to me, Lily.

430
00:47:22,703 --> 00:47:23,954
For what?

431
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:28,830
So you can send me back to work
whenever you run short of money?

432
00:47:31,003 --> 00:47:33,653
I thought you did it
because you loved me.

433
00:47:37,968 --> 00:47:41,764
How could I have ever?
You cripple!

434
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:00,866
The marshal's back.
The marshal's back.

435
00:48:12,586 --> 00:48:14,170
Mike, you and Slater
take him inside.

436
00:48:14,171 --> 00:48:16,757
They've got Pony Benner,
the killer.

437
00:48:16,924 --> 00:48:19,224
- Trouble?
- No, they came like lambs.

438
00:48:19,385 --> 00:48:22,388
McQuown spouted scripture
about truth and justice.

439
00:48:22,805 --> 00:48:26,349
He's already on his way
to make sure he gets the right jury.

440
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:29,060
That's out of our hands.
I sent Sam Brown for the sheriff.

441
00:48:29,061 --> 00:48:32,271
- Let's hang them, marshal.
- Let's save the sheriff a trip.

442
00:48:32,272 --> 00:48:35,191
- Yeah, marshal, let's hang them.
- Yeah, hang 'em.

443
00:48:35,192 --> 00:48:36,901
- Hang 'em.
- Hang 'em, marshal, right now.

444
00:48:36,902 --> 00:48:40,902
Guard them till the sheriff arrives.
Use as many men as you need.

445
00:48:53,836 --> 00:48:56,686
Get out of here.
This isn't an assembly hall.

446
00:48:59,091 --> 00:49:00,551
Let's hang them now!

447
00:49:11,103 --> 00:49:16,066
- I expect they mean to make trouble.
- I don't think so.

448
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:19,059
Just the same,
we better stay here.

449
00:49:20,571 --> 00:49:21,921
You better go, Gannon.

450
00:49:22,197 --> 00:49:26,535
- I just want to talk to my brother.
- I had nothing to do with it.

451
00:49:27,327 --> 00:49:29,745
You're better with a Winchester
than with your mouth, Calhoun.

452
00:49:29,746 --> 00:49:32,666
I wasn't even there.
Go on, tell him.

453
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:40,466
- They'll be trouble down there.
- Sounds like it.

454
00:49:41,091 --> 00:49:45,262
- Saw someone today to shock a man.
- Yeah.

455
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:49,391
- You seen her?
- Yeah.

456
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,813
People I'd rather see in Warlock
than Lily.

457
00:50:01,612 --> 00:50:06,700
The passenger they shot
was Ben Nicholson's brother.

458
00:50:07,618 --> 00:50:09,578
Came after me, I guess.

459
00:50:09,786 --> 00:50:13,707
Looks like them bad boys
did you a favour.

460
00:50:14,666 --> 00:50:17,960
I never could figure that
Ben Nicholson gunning for me.

461
00:50:17,961 --> 00:50:21,714
He'd settled down, there was even
talk of him and Lily getting married.

462
00:50:21,715 --> 00:50:24,801
There was talk of
a lot of men and Lily.

463
00:50:25,219 --> 00:50:27,220
Ben Nicholson
was a man with pride.

464
00:50:27,221 --> 00:50:30,721
He had to be top man,
so he tried you out, that's all.

465
00:50:31,016 --> 00:50:32,434
Is that all?

466
00:50:32,976 --> 00:50:35,826
He had a reputation,
but he wasn't that kind.

467
00:50:36,813 --> 00:50:40,232
I'd hate to think there was no reason
for me to kill Ben Nicholson.

468
00:50:40,233 --> 00:50:43,583
He was on the prowl for you.
He came gunning for you.

469
00:50:43,654 --> 00:50:46,156
Now, his brother comes after you.

470
00:50:49,409 --> 00:50:52,329
- Is it that simple?
- Clay, it's that simple.

471
00:51:12,641 --> 00:51:14,476
Hold it! Hold it!

472
00:51:15,102 --> 00:51:17,521
Get out of here before I shoot.

473
00:51:17,688 --> 00:51:19,981
- You can't stop us.
- You'll see if I don't.

474
00:51:19,982 --> 00:51:23,317
If you think a bunch of drunks
are going to bust this jail,

475
00:51:23,318 --> 00:51:25,418
you're mistaken.
Get out of here!

476
00:51:25,821 --> 00:51:27,446
We'll tromp you down,
Slavin.

477
00:51:27,447 --> 00:51:29,448
What's Johnny Gannon doing here?
He's one of them.

478
00:51:29,449 --> 00:51:30,784
I said, get.

479
00:51:50,887 --> 00:51:53,724
- Need another man?
- We surely do, Clay.

480
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:56,434
We're taking those road agents
out to hang, Blaisdell.

481
00:51:56,435 --> 00:52:00,020
You ain't gonna stop us.
We'll tromp you down like the rest.

482
00:52:00,021 --> 00:52:01,898
Come and tromp me, Fitz.

483
00:52:03,608 --> 00:52:04,901
Come here.

484
00:52:08,321 --> 00:52:09,865
Come here.

485
00:52:13,326 --> 00:52:16,496
- This ain't your pudding, marshal.
- Come here.

486
00:52:23,253 --> 00:52:25,754
You've done McQuown's work tonight,
Blaisdell.

487
00:52:25,755 --> 00:52:29,092
If you've anything to say,
say it, or go home.

488
00:52:31,761 --> 00:52:33,680
All of you, go home.

489
00:52:38,768 --> 00:52:40,437
And while you're doing it,

490
00:52:41,271 --> 00:52:45,421
think how being in a lynch mob
is a low a thing as a man can do.

491
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,156
Thank you, marshal.
Thank you kindly.

492
00:52:51,907 --> 00:52:54,910
I have to thank you.
It was my job.

493
00:53:00,207 --> 00:53:02,375
There's a man.

494
00:53:03,293 --> 00:53:06,962
Why don't you bring his boots and
we'll kiss them like he wants?

495
00:53:06,963 --> 00:53:10,592
Like you all do.
Bring us his boots!

496
00:53:13,887 --> 00:53:16,223
He just saved your life,
Billy.

497
00:53:19,059 --> 00:53:20,936
I wonder why.

498
00:53:35,742 --> 00:53:38,953
Mr. Richardson, you'll see that
any witnesses against him

499
00:53:38,954 --> 00:53:40,705
get to the trial.

500
00:53:40,872 --> 00:53:42,957
A lot of good that'll do,
sheriff.

501
00:53:42,958 --> 00:53:46,418
If you thought that, why didn't
you let the mob have him?

502
00:53:46,419 --> 00:53:48,919
We don't do things that way
in Warlock.

503
00:53:49,714 --> 00:53:51,299
Oh, we don't?

504
00:53:54,678 --> 00:53:58,473
I hear you get paid 400 a month,
Mr. Blaisdell.

505
00:54:00,058 --> 00:54:02,108
You and Morgan
are quite a team.

506
00:54:03,687 --> 00:54:06,398
I hear you have silk sheets
from China.

507
00:54:07,315 --> 00:54:09,733
I get a hundred a month
for being legal sheriff.

508
00:54:09,734 --> 00:54:12,234
Plus rheumatism
from sleeping cold nights.

509
00:54:15,991 --> 00:54:19,452
Mr. Blaisdell,
I've read a lot about you.

510
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,580
The way I figure, you operate outside
the law, same as those cowboys.

511
00:54:23,581 --> 00:54:27,711
What law?
When do you come down here?

512
00:54:27,877 --> 00:54:29,920
Why aren't we supplied
with enough deputies?

513
00:54:29,921 --> 00:54:33,842
Job's open. You can have
all the deputies you want.

514
00:54:34,009 --> 00:54:36,302
Well, you want the job, Buck?

515
00:54:37,262 --> 00:54:40,432
For what? 40 dollars a month
and a free pine box.

516
00:54:42,308 --> 00:54:43,309
How about you?

517
00:54:44,185 --> 00:54:46,395
You want to try doing it legal
for once?

518
00:54:46,396 --> 00:54:50,346
Sorry, sheriff. The principle
appeals to me, but the pay doesn't.

519
00:54:54,487 --> 00:54:56,865
Any man here ready to be deputy?

520
00:54:57,031 --> 00:54:59,533
Or is everyone in Warlock
chicken-livered?

521
00:54:59,534 --> 00:55:01,411
Or too greedy?

522
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:04,538
You want law in this town,
I offer you law.

523
00:55:04,539 --> 00:55:07,739
Just don't come whining to me
when there's trouble.

524
00:55:08,168 --> 00:55:12,518
And watch yourselves, hiring outside
gunmen who make a living by killing.

525
00:55:14,299 --> 00:55:16,092
Anybody?

526
00:55:17,927 --> 00:55:19,345
All right, then.

527
00:55:21,514 --> 00:55:25,769
- I'll take the job.
- You, Johnny Gannon?

528
00:55:27,479 --> 00:55:29,189
If you think I can do it.

529
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:40,700
Sure you can do it, Johnny.
Sure you can.

530
00:55:40,867 --> 00:55:42,202
Come inside.

531
00:55:51,753 --> 00:55:53,421
Keller, you can't do this.

532
00:55:53,588 --> 00:55:55,838
- Why can't I?
- He's one of them.

533
00:55:56,633 --> 00:55:59,135
I've known Johnny Gannon
all his life.

534
00:55:59,302 --> 00:56:01,303
He seems to have been
a good boy.

535
00:56:01,304 --> 00:56:04,640
Maybe a little wild,
but you can't condemn a man for that.

536
00:56:04,641 --> 00:56:08,341
Further, you can't condemn a man
for his brother or friends.

537
00:56:08,603 --> 00:56:11,653
What's more, he volunteered
when no one else did.

538
00:56:11,689 --> 00:56:14,274
So I'm making him
the new deputy of Warlock.

539
00:56:14,275 --> 00:56:16,318
And he'll be there
till I remove him.

540
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,488
Or he's carried out.

541
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:22,659
You know you're putting him up
against Blaisdell?

542
00:56:22,867 --> 00:56:25,036
Against any law breakers.

543
00:56:25,203 --> 00:56:27,603
You understand that,
don't you, Johnny?

544
00:56:27,997 --> 00:56:30,124
- I understand.
- Fine.

545
00:56:31,751 --> 00:56:33,378
Adiós, gentlemen.

546
00:56:36,047 --> 00:56:39,717
Looks like law's coming back
to Warlock.

547
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:43,179
But for how long, Judge?

548
00:57:11,916 --> 00:57:13,209
Miss Dollar,

549
00:57:14,544 --> 00:57:17,088
I just saw you coming up here.

550
00:57:17,255 --> 00:57:20,842
- You're the new deputy?
- Yes, my name's John Gannon.

551
00:57:21,134 --> 00:57:25,263
I thought I might ask you
a few questions.

552
00:57:28,516 --> 00:57:31,519
Those boys were let off, you know.
Acquitted.

553
00:57:31,728 --> 00:57:33,311
Isn't that what everyone expected?

554
00:57:33,312 --> 00:57:37,262
Yes, ma'am, but I'd like to know
who killed your Mr. Nicholson.

555
00:57:37,316 --> 00:57:39,277
He wasn't mine.

556
00:57:41,112 --> 00:57:45,908
You said there was a third man,
a shot came from behind some rocks.

557
00:57:46,075 --> 00:57:49,275
So it did. But what's the difference?
They got off.

558
00:57:49,287 --> 00:57:51,705
Yes, ma'am,
but I'd still like to know.

559
00:57:51,706 --> 00:57:55,506
Of course, your brother was
one of them. They're your friends.

560
00:57:56,127 --> 00:57:58,796
I'm not one of them, Miss Dollar.

561
00:57:58,963 --> 00:58:01,882
Suppose I tell you I know
who killed him, what would you do?

562
00:58:01,883 --> 00:58:04,844
I'd go after him.
Do you know?

563
00:58:05,887 --> 00:58:09,937
No, there's very little I know.
I'm a woman, I only feel things.

564
00:58:10,391 --> 00:58:13,491
You're a deputy and you want
answers to questions.

565
00:58:13,561 --> 00:58:15,812
- I tell you it doesn't matter.
- It does matter.

566
00:58:15,813 --> 00:58:18,566
The citizen's committee
is meeting right now.

567
00:58:18,733 --> 00:58:22,820
And those men from San Pablo
will be posted out of town.

568
00:58:23,154 --> 00:58:26,554
- By Clay Blaisdell?
- Yes. And if they didn't do it...

569
00:58:26,657 --> 00:58:29,007
Your brother's just a boy,
isn't he?

570
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:31,537
He's nineteen.

571
00:58:32,789 --> 00:58:35,249
No, he's not a boy.

572
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,920
But that's not really
why I care.

573
00:58:39,086 --> 00:58:40,546
- No?
- No, ma'am.

574
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:45,802
I'm the deputy sheriff,
and if Clay Blaisdell goes after him,

575
00:58:47,261 --> 00:58:51,516
I believe it's my job
to keep the law.

576
00:58:53,935 --> 00:58:57,104
- You'd go against Blaisdell?
- If I have to.

577
00:59:00,566 --> 00:59:03,861
I'm not a boy either,
Miss Dollar.

578
00:59:08,157 --> 00:59:09,659
Mr. Gannon...

579
00:59:15,164 --> 00:59:17,166
I'm sorry.

580
00:59:20,586 --> 00:59:22,255
I've rented a house.

581
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:25,591
I rented it off Mr. Petrix and...

582
00:59:25,967 --> 00:59:29,345
some boys are dropping
my trunks round this afternoon.

583
00:59:30,513 --> 00:59:32,763
I wonder if you'd help me
move in?

584
00:59:34,684 --> 00:59:38,229
Sure.
I'd like to help.

585
00:59:38,396 --> 00:59:39,938
- Around five.
- All right.

586
00:59:39,939 --> 00:59:42,589
- I'll try and cook supper for us.
- Fine.

587
00:59:44,402 --> 00:59:46,696
You don't have to look
so worried.

588
00:59:46,862 --> 00:59:48,447
I can cook.

589
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:26,986
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

590
01:00:27,194 --> 01:00:29,594
I thought you'd come
dressed for work.

591
01:00:29,739 --> 01:00:33,534
You said work and supper,
so I wasn't sure.

592
01:00:33,701 --> 01:00:36,579
- So I did. Come in.
- Thanks.

593
01:00:41,083 --> 01:00:42,835
It's a nice place.

594
01:00:43,127 --> 01:00:45,795
There'll be no supper
till all the work's done.

595
01:00:45,796 --> 01:00:48,465
All right.
What would you like me to do first?

596
01:00:48,466 --> 01:00:50,884
You can start by putting
those trunks in my bedroom.

597
01:00:50,885 --> 01:00:52,511
Yes, ma'am.

598
01:01:12,114 --> 01:01:14,364
That smells mighty good,
Miss Dollar.

599
01:01:14,825 --> 01:01:18,120
- Corn bread, meat and greens.
- Fine.

600
01:01:19,246 --> 01:01:21,581
Guess there's not many men
in Warlock

601
01:01:21,582 --> 01:01:23,482
eating home cooked food tonight.

602
01:01:24,543 --> 01:01:27,505
- Keep working, deputy.
- Yes, ma'am.

603
01:01:31,467 --> 01:01:33,094
Mighty good.

604
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,308
You didn't finish your greens,
Mr. Gannon.

605
01:01:40,893 --> 01:01:45,648
- My mother used to say that.
- It's a thing women say.

606
01:01:46,023 --> 01:01:49,443
- Where is she?
- She's dead, Miss Dollar.

607
01:01:50,194 --> 01:01:53,030
Lily. Just Lily.

608
01:01:54,949 --> 01:01:59,870
She died about nineteen years ago
in Nebraska.

609
01:02:01,705 --> 01:02:05,000
- And you father?
- The Apaches killed him.

610
01:02:05,167 --> 01:02:07,628
That was in the early days
out here.

611
01:02:07,795 --> 01:02:11,674
And Blaisdell's going to kill
your brother and the others.

612
01:02:12,508 --> 01:02:16,428
- If they come into town.
- You know they'll come in.

613
01:02:18,389 --> 01:02:23,477
You knew Blaisdell back in
Port James, didn't you?

614
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:27,606
Long before Port James.
I knew Morgan.

615
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:30,340
If you knew Morgan,
you knew Blaisdell.

616
01:02:31,193 --> 01:02:33,237
He dealt faro for Morgan.

617
01:02:33,404 --> 01:02:36,454
People knew him as a killer
right from the start.

618
01:02:37,491 --> 01:02:39,742
He was a colonel in the army
at 21.

619
01:02:39,743 --> 01:02:44,123
He never quit being a colonel.
All he knows is killing.

620
01:02:46,208 --> 01:02:48,308
What sort of man
is this McQuown?

621
01:02:49,003 --> 01:02:52,553
Worse than he ought to be
and getting worse all the time.

622
01:02:53,132 --> 01:02:56,635
- I used to think highly of him.
- But you left,

623
01:02:56,969 --> 01:02:58,619
and your brother stayed on.

624
01:03:00,389 --> 01:03:03,851
That's right.
I left.

625
01:03:04,768 --> 01:03:08,689
- Why?
- Oh, a lot of reasons.

626
01:03:09,231 --> 01:03:11,191
What reasons?

627
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:17,615
I never told anybody this before,
but...

628
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:22,994
About 10 months ago, some Mexicans
were supposed to have been massacred

629
01:03:22,995 --> 01:03:25,789
by Apaches
in Rattlesnake Canyon,

630
01:03:25,998 --> 01:03:28,448
at least, everybody said
it was Apaches.

631
01:03:29,084 --> 01:03:30,419
But it wasn't?

632
01:03:32,504 --> 01:03:36,175
No... No it wasn't.

633
01:03:39,762 --> 01:03:44,975
You see, we'd rustled more than
a thousand head at Haciendo Puerto

634
01:03:45,601 --> 01:03:49,730
across the border, but those
Mexicans trailed us back here.

635
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:55,819
So one night, a bunch of us stripped,
smeared ourselves with mud

636
01:03:55,986 --> 01:03:58,447
and boxed them up
in Rattlesnake Canyon.

637
01:03:59,865 --> 01:04:04,244
We killed them all.
37 of them.

638
01:04:06,705 --> 01:04:08,332
37...

639
01:04:10,709 --> 01:04:15,005
I don't know,
it was kind of like a dream.

640
01:04:16,215 --> 01:04:20,469
I'll never forget laying there,
sweating, covered with mud, waiting.

641
01:04:21,845 --> 01:04:23,972
It was so quiet

642
01:04:25,057 --> 01:04:27,351
and then, they came.

643
01:04:27,851 --> 01:04:31,021
Abe gave the signal,
we all started to fire.

644
01:04:33,315 --> 01:04:34,691
It was just awful.

645
01:04:35,734 --> 01:04:38,904
I don't think they got off
a single shot.

646
01:04:40,322 --> 01:04:44,034
All around me, Abe and the rest
were screaming like Apaches

647
01:04:44,409 --> 01:04:48,497
firing into the canyon till
there wasn't anybody left to shoot.

648
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,004
I say it was like a dream,
but it wasn't, it was real.

649
01:04:57,714 --> 01:05:00,092
It happened that way.

650
01:05:47,598 --> 01:05:51,018
- Good afternoon, Miss Jessie.
- I was just out riding...

651
01:05:51,184 --> 01:05:53,186
on my way to Medusa Mine

652
01:05:53,353 --> 01:05:56,815
and I heard the shots.
I had no idea it was you.

653
01:06:02,321 --> 01:06:06,325
- My, it's hot today.
- Yes, ma'am, it certainly is.

654
01:06:06,491 --> 01:06:09,828
- Not as hot as yesterday though.
- No, not nearly.

655
01:06:11,121 --> 01:06:15,500
I heard Buck Slavin say
he thought today was hotter.

656
01:06:16,835 --> 01:06:21,965
- Matter of opinion, I guess.
- Of course, a matter of opinion.

657
01:06:28,263 --> 01:06:30,848
Would you happen to have
some water in that canteen?

658
01:06:30,849 --> 01:06:34,770
- The heat makes one terribly thirsty.
- Yes, ma'am, I do.

659
01:06:41,568 --> 01:06:44,868
That's all right, I can drink
right from the canteen.

660
01:06:49,576 --> 01:06:53,538
- You were out riding, you said.
- On my way to Medusa mine.

661
01:06:54,748 --> 01:06:57,898
That mountain water sure
makes one feel much cooler.

662
01:06:58,043 --> 01:07:00,545
Yes, ma'am, it generally does.

663
01:07:01,463 --> 01:07:05,467
What are you doing out here?
Not shooting at bad men?

664
01:07:06,009 --> 01:07:08,845
- No, practising.
- Practising?

665
01:07:09,304 --> 01:07:13,433
Yes, ma'am. Just as you practice
the piano, I practice the Colt.

666
01:07:14,768 --> 01:07:17,968
The stakes are different,
but the reason's the same.

667
01:07:21,483 --> 01:07:24,194
What should we talk about now,
Miss Jessie?

668
01:07:25,904 --> 01:07:28,404
The men you posted
are coming into town.

669
01:07:29,032 --> 01:07:31,075
Thank you for warning me,
but I've already heard.

670
01:07:31,076 --> 01:07:33,036
Why does it have to happen?

671
01:07:33,745 --> 01:07:36,445
Why do these things always end
in bloodshed?

672
01:07:36,581 --> 01:07:38,667
That's how things are.

673
01:07:38,834 --> 01:07:41,484
That's why I was hired,
why you hired me.

674
01:07:43,296 --> 01:07:45,549
So, they'll come into town

675
01:07:45,757 --> 01:07:49,594
- And you'll shoot them dog dead?
- Or them me.

676
01:07:53,431 --> 01:07:55,225
Or them you.

677
01:07:58,228 --> 01:08:01,648
Understand, Miss Jessie,
I enjoy being marshal.

678
01:08:02,649 --> 01:08:05,025
I'm a simple man,
good only with Colts.

679
01:08:05,026 --> 01:08:07,696
It's all I am,
handy with Colts.

680
01:08:07,946 --> 01:08:12,367
Besides, being marshal's a habit.
Habits are hard to break.

681
01:08:12,701 --> 01:08:14,786
I know about habits.

682
01:08:16,538 --> 01:08:19,456
Before my father died he was sick
for nine years

683
01:08:19,457 --> 01:08:21,501
and I nursed him all that time.

684
01:08:22,127 --> 01:08:24,671
Guess I have the nursing habit.

685
01:08:24,838 --> 01:08:27,632
That summer,
there was a typhoid epidemic

686
01:08:27,799 --> 01:08:30,302
and I turned the house
into a hospital.

687
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:33,555
There were the injured
miners...

688
01:08:34,598 --> 01:08:36,808
It's strange...

689
01:08:37,142 --> 01:08:39,268
When I came to Warlock,
a very young girl

690
01:08:39,269 --> 01:08:42,522
I had dreams that someday,
I'd be someone.

691
01:08:42,981 --> 01:08:45,581
My father kept telling me
I'd be someone.

692
01:08:45,609 --> 01:08:48,819
You're someone, Miss Jessie.
You're the miners' angel.

693
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:51,281
Don't say that.
I hate being an angel.

694
01:08:51,448 --> 01:08:52,616
Miss Jessie.

695
01:08:52,782 --> 01:08:57,282
If you had whisky in that canteen,
you'd see how much of an angel I am.

696
01:08:57,662 --> 01:08:59,789
Have you ever tasted whisky?

697
01:08:59,915 --> 01:09:03,460
- Many times.
- How many?

698
01:09:06,713 --> 01:09:07,881
Once.

699
01:09:26,066 --> 01:09:29,152
- I wanted you to do that.
- I know.

700
01:09:30,195 --> 01:09:33,823
- I came out here to find you.
- I know.

701
01:09:34,407 --> 01:09:35,992
Is that dreadful of me?

702
01:09:37,869 --> 01:09:39,162
Dreadful.

703
01:10:07,315 --> 01:10:09,317
It's cooked just right,
Jessie.

704
01:10:09,484 --> 01:10:12,486
It takes a while
to get used to a man's tastes.

705
01:10:12,487 --> 01:10:15,322
My father used to like his meat
barely scorched.

706
01:10:15,323 --> 01:10:17,617
Chicken fried,
that's the only way.

707
01:10:20,161 --> 01:10:21,246
Clay...

708
01:10:22,247 --> 01:10:24,916
Why must those cowboys
come into town?

709
01:10:25,083 --> 01:10:28,628
They've been declared guilty
of being road agents.

710
01:10:29,212 --> 01:10:32,298
If they stay out,
yellow bellies besides.

711
01:10:32,882 --> 01:10:35,844
If they come in,
they'll think they're heroes

712
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:37,387
proving their innocent.

713
01:10:37,554 --> 01:10:39,848
Striking a blow for freedom, too.

714
01:10:40,348 --> 01:10:42,598
Men have died for that
many a time.

715
01:10:44,602 --> 01:10:46,271
I'll fix your eggs.

716
01:10:53,486 --> 01:10:56,406
Morning, miss.
Is the marshal available?

717
01:10:56,781 --> 01:11:00,535
Will you inform him there are three
murdering cowboys in town?

718
01:11:00,702 --> 01:11:04,663
- Come in, Morgan. Have a coffee.
- No, thank you. There isn't time.

719
01:11:04,664 --> 01:11:07,414
- Where are they?
- Down at the Lucky Dollar.

720
01:11:07,792 --> 01:11:09,543
I better go see what they want.

721
01:11:09,544 --> 01:11:12,588
- You haven't had your breakfast.
- Just as well, miss.

722
01:11:12,589 --> 01:11:16,389
If he takes a stomach wound,
it's better if he hasn't eaten.

723
01:11:17,051 --> 01:11:19,251
Keep the coffee hot,
I'll be back.

724
01:11:19,304 --> 01:11:20,388
Clay...

725
01:11:22,599 --> 01:11:25,727
- I'll make you a fresh breakfast.
- Thank you.

726
01:11:28,605 --> 01:11:31,690
I think we're going to see a finish
of the McQuowns this morning.

727
01:11:31,691 --> 01:11:33,985
Yeah, then we can move on.

728
01:11:34,485 --> 01:11:35,653
Where to?

729
01:11:35,904 --> 01:11:38,280
A fellow dropped in last night
from Palfrie City.

730
01:11:38,281 --> 01:11:42,285
Sounds like it's made for us,
booming with a gold strike,

731
01:11:42,452 --> 01:11:44,078
we ought to take a look.

732
01:11:44,537 --> 01:11:47,937
- I don't think so. Not this time.
- What do you mean?

733
01:11:48,541 --> 01:11:51,085
Jessie and I
are going to get married.

734
01:11:51,461 --> 01:11:53,463
Yeah?
When?

735
01:11:54,005 --> 01:11:57,455
In a couple of weeks,
as soon as I can get a preacher.

736
01:11:57,967 --> 01:12:00,802
I guess I'll be going to Palfrie City
alone...

737
01:12:00,803 --> 01:12:02,137
Why do you have to go?

738
01:12:02,138 --> 01:12:04,182
It's the way it's always been.

739
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:06,350
You do ajob,
you move on to the next.

740
01:12:06,351 --> 01:12:08,353
This time, it's different.

741
01:12:08,645 --> 01:12:10,188
Blaisdell, reach.

742
01:12:12,941 --> 01:12:14,941
It's a bad morning for thinking.

743
01:12:16,402 --> 01:12:19,197
Thinking of weddings
could lead to a funeral.

744
01:12:20,114 --> 01:12:23,159
- Shall we, marshal?
- Thank you, Mr. Morgan.

745
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:31,501
- We're with you, marshal.
- Good luck.

746
01:12:36,339 --> 01:12:37,889
If I can help, marshal...

747
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:05,535
Deputy!

748
01:13:20,091 --> 01:13:23,427
- Marshal, let me try to talk to them.
- What good would it do?

749
01:13:23,428 --> 01:13:25,762
- One of them is my brother.
- We're wasting time.

750
01:13:25,763 --> 01:13:28,432
- We have to move now, Clay.
- It's my fight, deputy.

751
01:13:28,433 --> 01:13:30,983
- They called me out.
- Yes, I know that.

752
01:13:33,521 --> 01:13:36,649
- All right, go ahead.
- Thanks.

753
01:13:42,363 --> 01:13:44,463
You're throwing in with us, Jonny?

754
01:13:44,615 --> 01:13:49,620
- Billy, you can't do this.
- You're a weasel, like Calhoun.

755
01:13:49,871 --> 01:13:51,913
Blaisdell saved you
from that lynch mob

756
01:13:51,914 --> 01:13:55,167
and he could've killed you
that night in the French Palace.

757
01:13:55,168 --> 01:13:57,085
There's no need for this,
no reason.

758
01:13:57,086 --> 01:13:59,671
There's reason enough,
to stand up and be a man.

759
01:13:59,672 --> 01:14:02,632
This is a free territory, and while
gunmen like Blaisdell...

760
01:14:02,633 --> 01:14:05,218
You're talking Abe's foolishness.
He'll kill you.

761
01:14:05,219 --> 01:14:06,804
I'm not scared of him.

762
01:14:07,597 --> 01:14:09,182
Are you, Johnny?

763
01:14:09,348 --> 01:14:12,435
I'm scared of dying,
just like any man,

764
01:14:12,935 --> 01:14:14,854
and so are you, Billy.

765
01:14:18,065 --> 01:14:21,402
I just want to know
what you're going to do.

766
01:14:21,944 --> 01:14:24,196
Are you going to back me,
or Blaisdell?

767
01:14:24,197 --> 01:14:26,997
I won't back him,
because you're my brother.

768
01:14:27,575 --> 01:14:30,325
And I won't back you,
because you're wrong.

769
01:14:32,914 --> 01:14:35,333
Pony said it'd be no use.

770
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:44,800
Come one, Blaisdell!

771
01:14:45,301 --> 01:14:46,928
Billy, don't!

772
01:15:24,423 --> 01:15:25,966
You don't have to fight me.

773
01:15:25,967 --> 01:15:28,719
You and your partners,
just ride out.

774
01:15:32,014 --> 01:15:33,064
Go for your gun.

775
01:15:34,058 --> 01:15:37,186
Don't make me kill you, boys.
Clear on out.

776
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:40,481
Go for your gun!

777
01:15:50,074 --> 01:15:51,158
Oh, no...

778
01:15:52,493 --> 01:15:54,036
Billy, Billy...

779
01:16:04,714 --> 01:16:06,172
I had nothing to do with it...

780
01:16:06,173 --> 01:16:09,301
Start shooting,
or get out of town.

781
01:16:09,927 --> 01:16:12,971
I could've killed you,
if they hadn't done that.

782
01:16:12,972 --> 01:16:14,682
We only wanted to talk.

783
01:16:15,975 --> 01:16:18,351
Mr. Richardson,
we only wanted to talk.

784
01:16:18,352 --> 01:16:19,562
Friendly...

785
01:16:45,796 --> 01:16:47,173
Three hits.

786
01:16:47,298 --> 01:16:51,298
One through the throat, two not
a finger apart, through the heart.

787
01:16:51,469 --> 01:16:55,222
I must be losing my touch.
All three were chest aimed.

788
01:17:01,937 --> 01:17:04,023
Clay, you've been hit.

789
01:17:04,190 --> 01:17:07,067
Is that true,
what Friendly said?

790
01:17:07,234 --> 01:17:11,405
You saw it, Mr. Petrix.
Did it look like they came to talk?

791
01:17:12,364 --> 01:17:16,952
- Let's have nurse fix that up.
- I'll take it to Miss Jessie's.

792
01:17:17,328 --> 01:17:20,078
Doc will fix it
while I finish my breakfast.

793
01:17:23,083 --> 01:17:25,085
You gotta...
You gotta...

794
01:17:25,252 --> 01:17:27,922
You gotta tell everybody, Johnny.

795
01:17:28,088 --> 01:17:29,465
Yes, Billy.

796
01:17:29,632 --> 01:17:32,885
- I didn't know.
- Yes, Billy.

797
01:17:40,142 --> 01:17:41,602
Billy...

798
01:17:44,146 --> 01:17:47,107
Billy, Billy, Billy...

799
01:17:49,235 --> 01:17:50,527
Billy...

800
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,378
- Evening, Mr. Marshal.
- Are you McQuown's messenger boy?

801
01:18:08,379 --> 01:18:10,923
No, sir.
This poster is my work.

802
01:18:11,632 --> 01:18:14,384
Excellent lettering and spelling,
don't you think?

803
01:18:14,385 --> 01:18:16,345
But not your idea, I hope.

804
01:18:16,512 --> 01:18:19,312
No. I have to give Abe
full credit for that.

805
01:18:20,683 --> 01:18:25,729
Chief of regulators. That's a fancy
title. Did you think that up?

806
01:18:25,896 --> 01:18:28,482
No, sir.
Once again, Abe gets the credit.

807
01:18:28,816 --> 01:18:33,362
He said that if Warlock
could appoint a marshal

808
01:18:33,529 --> 01:18:34,947
outside the law,

809
01:18:35,114 --> 01:18:38,114
then somebody could appoint
a chief of regulators.

810
01:18:38,242 --> 01:18:40,244
And who would that someone be?

811
01:18:40,452 --> 01:18:43,705
That's be the Cowboys' Council
for the Protection of San Pablo.

812
01:18:43,706 --> 01:18:45,374
I made that title up.

813
01:18:45,666 --> 01:18:48,585
You know, this could get to be
quite a thing.

814
01:18:48,919 --> 01:18:50,712
The town of Warlock
appoints a marshal

815
01:18:50,713 --> 01:18:53,382
he kills a whole bunch
of us cowboys

816
01:18:53,549 --> 01:18:55,217
and we appoint regulators

817
01:18:55,384 --> 01:18:57,011
and we kill you

818
01:18:57,177 --> 01:19:00,221
and the town gets another marshal
who kills more cowboys

819
01:19:00,222 --> 01:19:01,849
and we appoint...

820
01:19:02,433 --> 01:19:06,437
Well, you can see how it'd go
back and forth for all time.

821
01:19:06,603 --> 01:19:09,314
It'd be like looking
into two mirrors,

822
01:19:09,481 --> 01:19:10,733
put face to face.

823
01:19:11,942 --> 01:19:15,946
Marshal,
I've got so many of these.

824
01:19:16,155 --> 01:19:19,355
I wonder if you'd like to have one,
as a keepsake.

825
01:19:20,367 --> 01:19:21,577
Thank you.

826
01:19:23,245 --> 01:19:24,872
For your collection.

827
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,420
Clay...

828
01:19:32,588 --> 01:19:34,338
You've seen the poster, huh?

829
01:19:34,631 --> 01:19:36,883
You take the buggy, Jessie.
I'll stay and talk to Tom.

830
01:19:36,884 --> 01:19:38,552
All right, Clay.

831
01:19:39,136 --> 01:19:41,346
Maybe you better stay
and find out

832
01:19:41,555 --> 01:19:43,389
what it's like being married
to a marshal.

833
01:19:43,390 --> 01:19:46,350
If he doesn't handle this right,
he'll be a dead man.

834
01:19:46,351 --> 01:19:49,438
I'm sure Clay can handle
almost anything.

835
01:19:49,646 --> 01:19:52,399
An army.
An army's coming in.

836
01:19:52,566 --> 01:19:55,616
This isn't just a test,
like when we first came.

837
01:19:55,652 --> 01:19:58,602
This is a war, ma'am,
a war they have to win.

838
01:19:58,697 --> 01:20:01,047
Fifteen or twenty men
against two men.

839
01:20:02,117 --> 01:20:06,267
If you're worried about the numbers,
maybe I better handle it alone.

840
01:20:10,584 --> 01:20:12,252
Maybe I will, Clay.

841
01:20:15,589 --> 01:20:19,468
Maybe you better go
to Palfrie City alone.

842
01:20:25,682 --> 01:20:28,810
All right, Clay.
Maybe I will.

843
01:20:31,688 --> 01:20:35,609
Miss, maybe you'd like to take
a Colt in his defence.

844
01:20:42,658 --> 01:20:43,992
Blaisdell...

845
01:20:47,538 --> 01:20:50,916
I just want to tell you
that this is my job.

846
01:20:51,083 --> 01:20:54,920
- To keep the peace.
- How do you propose to do that?

847
01:20:55,087 --> 01:20:57,587
I'll tell McQuown
he's not to come in.

848
01:20:59,049 --> 01:21:00,676
He'll come in all right

849
01:21:01,301 --> 01:21:05,847
and, when he does,
you're not going to fight my fight.

850
01:21:06,348 --> 01:21:11,395
I guess I'll have to. This is
the law's business, not yours.

851
01:21:16,024 --> 01:21:18,235
Nor yours, Mr. Morgan.

852
01:21:19,569 --> 01:21:22,698
Looks like our problem
is solved, Morgan.

853
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:24,741
The law's taking over.

854
01:21:28,829 --> 01:21:31,540
- You can't mean that.
- Why not?

855
01:21:32,124 --> 01:21:35,418
Let's see if Warlock is grown up
enough to take care of itself.

856
01:21:35,419 --> 01:21:39,339
Clay, if you're not the marshal,
you're nothing.

857
01:21:40,299 --> 01:21:41,883
Maybe it's time.

858
01:21:42,801 --> 01:21:45,137
Maybe we've run out of towns.

859
01:22:14,124 --> 01:22:16,084
Boys, we have a visitor.

860
01:22:20,297 --> 01:22:23,508
If it isn't Johnny Gannon,
come back to San Pablo.

861
01:22:24,509 --> 01:22:28,137
Come in, Johnny. Don't stand there
like you mightn't be welcome.

862
01:22:28,138 --> 01:22:32,038
It's bad manners coming out here
with that star hanging on you.

863
01:22:32,225 --> 01:22:34,436
- Whisky, Johnny?
- No, thanks.

864
01:22:34,936 --> 01:22:36,286
Didn't come to drink.

865
01:22:37,522 --> 01:22:41,109
I came to tell you
not to come into town, Abe.

866
01:22:43,278 --> 01:22:45,989
- Blaisdell sent you out here.
- No.

867
01:22:47,032 --> 01:22:49,701
- Who's the message from then?
- From me.

868
01:22:51,536 --> 01:22:52,621
You.

869
01:22:53,830 --> 01:22:55,123
You're telling us.

870
01:22:55,332 --> 01:22:58,418
I'm the deputy, Abe,
and I'm telling you.

871
01:23:00,086 --> 01:23:02,631
- You are posting us.
- Nobody's posted.

872
01:23:04,257 --> 01:23:08,970
But no wild bunch of "regulators"
is coming in to make trouble.

873
01:23:09,471 --> 01:23:11,640
Let me rip that star off him, Abe.

874
01:23:14,434 --> 01:23:18,396
- That's the way it is, then, Johnny?
- That's the way it is.

875
01:23:28,490 --> 01:23:32,409
What do you mean coming ton my place
telling me I'm not to go in there?

876
01:23:32,410 --> 01:23:36,623
Look out, Abe, I rode out with him.
Johnny's getting mad.

877
01:23:36,831 --> 01:23:42,045
Blaisdell will cut us down one by one
unless we go in there together.

878
01:23:42,212 --> 01:23:44,797
That'd be a thing
I'd be bound to stop too.

879
01:23:44,798 --> 01:23:48,301
Yeah. Like you stopped him
from cutting Billy down.

880
01:23:48,468 --> 01:23:52,847
That was a fair fight, Abe.
At least, from Blaisdell's side.

881
01:23:53,306 --> 01:23:57,006
Billy came in to kill him.
Calhoun was set to backshoot him.

882
01:23:58,311 --> 01:24:00,711
- That's a lie.
- No, it's the truth.

883
01:24:01,231 --> 01:24:05,781
I talked to Billy before the fight
and I'd swear it in any court of law.

884
01:24:06,987 --> 01:24:07,988
Yeah,

885
01:24:08,822 --> 01:24:10,407
you'll swear all right,

886
01:24:11,241 --> 01:24:15,241
but, you'll swear Billy said
he only wanted to talk to Blaisdell.

887
01:24:15,745 --> 01:24:17,080
Swear it.

888
01:24:17,831 --> 01:24:20,292
Swear it here and now

889
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:23,250
or I'll see your dirty, lying soul
in hell.

890
01:24:24,421 --> 01:24:26,464
I guess I won't, Abe.

891
01:24:30,969 --> 01:24:32,069
- Swear it.
- No.

892
01:24:32,178 --> 01:24:34,428
- Swear it, or I'll kill you.
- No.

893
01:24:36,141 --> 01:24:37,766
Go on, hit in.
Cut him up.

894
01:24:37,767 --> 01:24:39,144
- Say it.
- No.

895
01:24:39,311 --> 01:24:40,645
Say it!

896
01:25:01,708 --> 01:25:03,908
Move, Johnny,
and I'll cut it off.

897
01:25:04,711 --> 01:25:06,254
Don't move, Johnny.

898
01:25:08,298 --> 01:25:09,591
- Swear it.
- No.

899
01:25:09,799 --> 01:25:12,719
Abe, this isn't doing any good.

900
01:25:13,094 --> 01:25:14,679
Hold off, Abe.

901
01:25:14,846 --> 01:25:17,696
Swear it, Johnny,
or I swear I will kill you.

902
01:25:17,974 --> 01:25:22,019
You better kill me, if you want
to take your regulators into Warlock.

903
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:24,230
Otherwise, I'll stop you.

904
01:25:25,231 --> 01:25:28,901
I'd sure like to see him try
to stop us, wouldn't you, Abe?

905
01:25:28,902 --> 01:25:30,695
I'd like to see that, Abe.

906
01:25:32,238 --> 01:25:34,240
Stop us, then.

907
01:25:41,289 --> 01:25:42,916
We'll be in tomorrow.

908
01:25:46,294 --> 01:25:49,644
Give it to him.
He can't do anything with it, anyway.

909
01:26:08,191 --> 01:26:09,734
I've warned you.

910
01:26:10,568 --> 01:26:12,278
Don't come into Warlock.

911
01:26:35,552 --> 01:26:36,970
Johnny...

912
01:26:38,596 --> 01:26:40,890
I'm the law, Curley.

913
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:44,102
I'm the law.

914
01:26:55,864 --> 01:26:57,240
I'm alone.

915
01:27:02,161 --> 01:27:03,496
They coming in?

916
01:27:04,831 --> 01:27:06,916
Yes, near sundown.

917
01:27:07,667 --> 01:27:10,717
Cade says he's going to kill you
himself, Johnny.

918
01:27:11,588 --> 01:27:14,549
- I thought I saw...
- It's all right, Buck.

919
01:27:16,092 --> 01:27:19,512
Why did you come in, Curley?
Abe's gonna be mad.

920
01:27:21,931 --> 01:27:25,631
I thought that if you knew
they weren't coming till sundown,

921
01:27:26,519 --> 01:27:29,813
maybe you've got business
in Bright City or something.

922
01:27:29,814 --> 01:27:32,614
I'm staying here.
Go back and tell him that.

923
01:27:32,734 --> 01:27:35,569
- That hand, against Abe and Cade?
- I'm staying.

924
01:27:35,570 --> 01:27:39,574
- My, but you're brave...
- Go back and tell them I'm here.

925
01:27:43,536 --> 01:27:45,663
You're a fool, Johnny.

926
01:27:46,831 --> 01:27:48,249
Curley...

927
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:53,129
Cade gonna be doing
his usual backshooting?

928
01:27:55,089 --> 01:27:57,592
The least you'll get
is a fair fight.

929
01:27:58,509 --> 01:28:01,179
- I promise.
- Then, tell them.

930
01:28:03,348 --> 01:28:05,683
It'll be a waste of time.

931
01:28:07,018 --> 01:28:09,228
I'll stay around town and wait.

932
01:28:16,402 --> 01:28:20,031
This hand won't hold much,
especially not a Colt.

933
01:28:22,950 --> 01:28:28,164
Well, I guess I've got time
for some sleep.

934
01:28:28,831 --> 01:28:31,376
So you'll be clear-eyed
when you die.

935
01:28:32,418 --> 01:28:35,838
Doc, maybe you could give me
some laudanum for later.

936
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:42,190
- Six drops in a glass of water.
- You're against McQuown and Blaisdell.

937
01:28:42,303 --> 01:28:44,353
You'll be killed,
you know that!

938
01:28:52,855 --> 01:28:54,232
Yes, come in.

939
01:28:55,233 --> 01:28:57,333
A lady to see you,
Mr. Blaisdell.

940
01:29:00,822 --> 01:29:02,156
Come in, Lily.

941
01:29:06,202 --> 01:29:09,413
I came to ask you for something,
a favour.

942
01:29:10,331 --> 01:29:12,834
I want Gannon for Ben Nicholson.

943
01:29:14,710 --> 01:29:17,755
- You owe me this, Clay.
- I owe nothing.

944
01:29:17,964 --> 01:29:20,814
Ben Nicholson came after me.
He called me out.

945
01:29:21,008 --> 01:29:24,758
Don't you know he went to see Morgan
first? Morgan sent him.

946
01:29:24,762 --> 01:29:26,139
I don't believe that.

947
01:29:29,767 --> 01:29:33,437
It's not important any more.
I don't care about that.

948
01:29:34,939 --> 01:29:37,942
I don't even care
about Ben Nicholson anymore.

949
01:29:39,485 --> 01:29:42,154
I only want an end
to this killing.

950
01:29:44,323 --> 01:29:47,994
I hated you
and wanted you killed,

951
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:50,060
but I don't want that anymore.

952
01:29:50,413 --> 01:29:52,039
Clay, I was wondering...

953
01:29:53,833 --> 01:29:57,169
Well, well, well...
Hello, Lily.

954
01:29:58,170 --> 01:30:01,299
What's she going to do,
shoot you or poison you?

955
01:30:06,345 --> 01:30:09,473
- What did she want?
- She's worried about Gannon.

956
01:30:09,765 --> 01:30:11,100
Is that all?

957
01:30:11,267 --> 01:30:13,019
- Morgan...
- Yeah?

958
01:30:14,061 --> 01:30:16,961
Did you talk to Ben Nicholson
the day he died?

959
01:30:17,023 --> 01:30:19,723
What would I have to do
with Ben Nicholson?

960
01:30:21,777 --> 01:30:24,777
- What did you tell him?
- None of your business.

961
01:30:25,239 --> 01:30:29,117
Come here again and talk to Clay
behind my back, and I'll kill you.

962
01:30:29,118 --> 01:30:32,997
I'll kill anybody who's dangerous
to Clay, even you, Lily.

963
01:30:34,582 --> 01:30:37,084
Tom, why do you do this?

964
01:30:38,919 --> 01:30:43,924
He's the only person who looked at me
and didn't see a cripple.

965
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,344
Get out of here.

966
01:30:48,888 --> 01:30:51,888
Better say a prayer
for the soul of your deputy.

967
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,821
Not too bad, huh?

968
01:31:06,614 --> 01:31:08,074
Not too good, either.

969
01:31:09,325 --> 01:31:12,620
I never was very fast,
but I can shoot well enough.

970
01:31:12,995 --> 01:31:15,195
Well enough
may not be good enough.

971
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:18,918
Afternoon, deputy.

972
01:31:19,752 --> 01:31:21,420
Hello, Mr. Blaisdell.

973
01:31:22,296 --> 01:31:24,547
Guess I'll be getting
some early supper.

974
01:31:24,548 --> 01:31:28,051
Blaisdell, if you've come to offer
us help, we don't want it.

975
01:31:28,052 --> 01:31:31,722
We? Hadn't you better let Gannon
decide that?

976
01:31:31,889 --> 01:31:35,475
Don't you understand that as long as
you're here there'll be killing?

977
01:31:35,476 --> 01:31:37,269
You're a target.

978
01:31:37,478 --> 01:31:40,898
They must come after you.
Let us alone, Blaisdell.

979
01:31:41,065 --> 01:31:43,067
Come on, judge. Come on.

980
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:57,540
- Mind if I sit?
- Go ahead.

981
01:32:06,924 --> 01:32:09,301
- How's your hand?
- It's all right.

982
01:32:18,644 --> 01:32:20,994
I remember when I first
killed a man.

983
01:32:21,856 --> 01:32:24,441
It was clear
and had to be done.

984
01:32:25,484 --> 01:32:29,446
I went home afterwards
and puked my insides out.

985
01:32:31,657 --> 01:32:33,826
I remember how clear it was.

986
01:32:35,411 --> 01:32:40,291
Afterwards, nothing was ever
clear again, except for one thing,

987
01:32:42,376 --> 01:32:46,088
to hold strictly to the rules,
only the rules matter.

988
01:32:48,215 --> 01:32:51,135
Hold onto them
like walking on eggs.

989
01:32:51,969 --> 01:32:55,764
So you know you've fought
as fair and as best you could.

990
01:32:58,809 --> 01:33:03,022
But there are things
to watch for, in yourself.

991
01:33:04,982 --> 01:33:06,775
Don't be too fast.

992
01:33:07,484 --> 01:33:11,284
When there are people after you,
you know it, you're worrying,

993
01:33:12,573 --> 01:33:13,991
then, you think...

994
01:33:14,783 --> 01:33:18,037
if I don't get drawn first,
and them killed first...

995
01:33:23,709 --> 01:33:25,336
Know what I mean?

996
01:33:28,339 --> 01:33:29,590
I know.

997
01:33:34,345 --> 01:33:36,595
Can you draw
with that hand, deputy?

998
01:33:38,307 --> 01:33:39,642
I can.

999
01:33:45,064 --> 01:33:46,523
Let's see you draw.

1000
01:34:11,090 --> 01:34:13,840
This evening,
there'll be a lot against you.

1001
01:34:14,968 --> 01:34:19,640
I'd be honoured
if you'd accept my offer to help,

1002
01:34:19,807 --> 01:34:21,684
just to back you up.

1003
01:34:22,309 --> 01:34:26,359
Mr. Blaisdell, I'd like your help
more than anything in the world,

1004
01:34:26,939 --> 01:34:29,775
but it's time this town
stood on its own.

1005
01:34:31,276 --> 01:34:32,319
Who knows?

1006
01:34:32,528 --> 01:34:36,990
Maybe the people of Warlock
will help by backing the law.

1007
01:34:37,157 --> 01:34:39,034
I wouldn't count on that.

1008
01:34:40,327 --> 01:34:45,165
But I'll be there to back you.
Will you come and have a whisky?

1009
01:34:46,458 --> 01:34:48,627
No, thanks. Maybe later.

1010
01:34:49,586 --> 01:34:52,756
Right now, I've got things to do.

1011
01:35:02,516 --> 01:35:05,269
Sure is noisy out there today.

1012
01:35:05,811 --> 01:35:08,361
Little boys waiting
for the circus parade.

1013
01:35:08,439 --> 01:35:09,773
How.

1014
01:35:10,524 --> 01:35:11,733
How.

1015
01:35:17,448 --> 01:35:20,534
Lily is sure gone on that deputy.

1016
01:35:21,243 --> 01:35:25,622
- Pity she won't have him long.
- Unless we take a hand.

1017
01:35:27,416 --> 01:35:28,876
Meaning what?

1018
01:35:30,752 --> 01:35:32,880
Remember that time in Gran Fort,

1019
01:35:33,213 --> 01:35:36,550
those strangers had us in a hotel
with a guard?

1020
01:35:37,217 --> 01:35:42,139
Lily splashed a can of kerosene,
came running up all on fire.

1021
01:35:42,890 --> 01:35:44,975
She sure got us out of that one.

1022
01:35:47,311 --> 01:35:49,479
I think we owe her one,
Morgan.

1023
01:35:53,025 --> 01:35:56,028
That's funny,
that's very funny.

1024
01:35:56,278 --> 01:35:58,529
You've practically give up marshal
in this town.

1025
01:35:58,530 --> 01:36:01,824
The only way for you to be important
is for Gannon to die.

1026
01:36:01,825 --> 01:36:06,375
Now you want to back Gannon, so he'll
be the hero and you'll be nothing?

1027
01:36:07,039 --> 01:36:10,739
- That's very funny.
- I'm not playing king of the mountain.

1028
01:36:10,876 --> 01:36:13,336
It's not a question
of who's top or bottom.

1029
01:36:13,337 --> 01:36:16,047
It's this town holding together
against McQuown.

1030
01:36:16,048 --> 01:36:19,592
- I'm a citizen of this town...
- If you want to play second fiddle,

1031
01:36:19,593 --> 01:36:21,553
don't expect me to back you.

1032
01:36:22,596 --> 01:36:25,446
I've never asked for your help
before, Morgan.

1033
01:36:26,642 --> 01:36:29,942
Clay, how do you think
you've stayed alive this long?

1034
01:36:39,029 --> 01:36:40,572
They're here, Morgan.

1035
01:36:50,707 --> 01:36:53,357
You're not going out there
to save Gannon.

1036
01:36:53,543 --> 01:36:56,643
After he's dead,
they'll beg you to protect them.

1037
01:36:56,964 --> 01:36:59,466
Just sit down and wait, Clay.

1038
01:37:21,238 --> 01:37:22,948
Blaisdell was right.

1039
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:25,826
He said I'd put too much on you.

1040
01:37:26,493 --> 01:37:29,413
- They're here.
- You put nothing on me.

1041
01:37:29,579 --> 01:37:32,582
It's just a time and a place
for a showdown.

1042
01:37:32,749 --> 01:37:36,149
You haven't a chance unless
you let Blaisdell help you.

1043
01:37:36,211 --> 01:37:37,671
No, judge.

1044
01:37:38,004 --> 01:37:42,007
If a deputy's worth anything, he
can't hole up when there's trouble.

1045
01:37:42,008 --> 01:37:47,013
You're nothing to me, just a badge
and an office, that's all.

1046
01:37:47,389 --> 01:37:49,989
Get yourself killed.
You're nothing to me.

1047
01:39:20,273 --> 01:39:23,173
Abe, I'll give you five minutes
to leave town.

1048
01:39:31,910 --> 01:39:35,497
Johnny, go for your gun,
you yellow-livered coward.

1049
01:39:35,956 --> 01:39:37,165
Go on!

1050
01:39:42,170 --> 01:39:43,672
- Hold it.
- Hold it.

1051
01:39:43,838 --> 01:39:46,675
- Drop your gun.
- Take it easy, Joe.

1052
01:40:36,182 --> 01:40:37,767
I promised you, Johnny.

1053
01:40:38,351 --> 01:40:40,478
I promised you a fair fight.

1054
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:46,443
You regulators
are all under arrest!

1055
01:40:47,485 --> 01:40:52,198
Brown, you, Bush, Mosby,

1056
01:40:52,991 --> 01:40:56,491
you're deputised to take them
into Bright City for trial.

1057
01:40:59,247 --> 01:41:02,397
Now, we'll see how far
the law can go in Warlock.

1058
01:41:09,132 --> 01:41:12,426
- You gambled and lost, Morgan.
- At least you're alive.

1059
01:41:12,427 --> 01:41:13,720
Am I?

1060
01:41:13,887 --> 01:41:16,472
Think they'd have backed you,
like they did Gannon?

1061
01:41:16,473 --> 01:41:18,891
They pay you half hoping
to see you killed.

1062
01:41:18,892 --> 01:41:21,895
Wouldn't it be better
to go down decently?

1063
01:41:22,061 --> 01:41:24,271
Isn't that what
you've always said?

1064
01:41:24,272 --> 01:41:26,565
- I've kept you from it many a time.
- Like now?

1065
01:41:26,566 --> 01:41:30,466
- Hiding in a room with a gun on me?
- No, like in Port James.

1066
01:41:30,570 --> 01:41:32,905
It was me that got
the drop on them.

1067
01:41:32,906 --> 01:41:34,991
And the Ellersons, me again.

1068
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:38,285
And Calhoun, ready to backhoot you,
who saved your life? Me.

1069
01:41:38,286 --> 01:41:41,536
- And Bob Nicholson at the stage?
- And Bob Nicholson.

1070
01:41:44,792 --> 01:41:46,669
And Ben Nicholson, too.

1071
01:41:50,965 --> 01:41:52,634
Lily was telling the truth.

1072
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,900
You used me to get back
at Lily.

1073
01:41:55,011 --> 01:41:57,180
Lily had nothing to do with it...

1074
01:41:57,347 --> 01:42:00,557
Morgan, you're telling me things
to make me kill you.

1075
01:42:00,558 --> 01:42:02,935
I'm going to Jessie's.
I'll send for my things.

1076
01:42:02,936 --> 01:42:05,230
We'll talk later.

1077
01:42:05,522 --> 01:42:07,481
Clay, you've got to face Gannon.

1078
01:42:07,482 --> 01:42:10,651
- Let him know you're in charge.
- Gannon's in charge. I'm resigning.

1079
01:42:10,652 --> 01:42:12,277
Or would you have me kill him too
because of Lily?

1080
01:42:12,278 --> 01:42:15,615
- That's not why I did those things.
- No, then why?

1081
01:42:15,823 --> 01:42:20,328
- Why? Was it for me or you?
- Not for me. You're my friend.

1082
01:42:20,495 --> 01:42:23,080
- The only friend I ever had, Clay.
- It's finished, Morgan.

1083
01:42:23,081 --> 01:42:26,981
Clay! You won't face Gannon
because you're yellow clean through.

1084
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:29,712
Has Jessie made you like that?

1085
01:42:30,463 --> 01:42:33,013
Clay, I'm not the cripple here,
you are.

1086
01:42:33,174 --> 01:42:35,468
If you don't kill Gannon,
I will.

1087
01:42:35,635 --> 01:42:37,387
I swear I will!

1088
01:42:43,810 --> 01:42:45,603
Murch... Murch!

1089
01:42:46,854 --> 01:42:48,439
Bring me some whisky.

1090
01:43:23,141 --> 01:43:25,241
"Tomorrow and tomorrow
and tomorrow

1091
01:43:26,978 --> 01:43:29,188
creeps in this petty pace...

1092
01:43:30,606 --> 01:43:32,316
from day to day...

1093
01:43:36,988 --> 01:43:39,949
to the last syllable
of recorded time."

1094
01:43:54,589 --> 01:43:56,466
Murch, give me your Colts.

1095
01:43:57,633 --> 01:44:00,933
- You're been drinking...
- I said give me your Colts.

1096
01:44:19,363 --> 01:44:22,700
I'm the black rattlesnake
of the whole territory.

1097
01:44:23,367 --> 01:44:25,787
I'll kill anything that moves.

1098
01:44:26,204 --> 01:44:28,331
Just sit still, or die.

1099
01:44:29,707 --> 01:44:33,503
And, if you move,
you crawl.

1100
01:44:43,471 --> 01:44:44,889
Who wants to die?

1101
01:44:45,473 --> 01:44:49,323
I got lightening in both hands,
I'm just spoiling for a fight.

1102
01:44:53,981 --> 01:44:56,150
I'll kill anything that moves!

1103
01:45:00,446 --> 01:45:05,159
I've killed 45 men, and tonight
I'm going to run up that score.

1104
01:45:11,249 --> 01:45:13,459
Where's that brave deputy?

1105
01:45:14,627 --> 01:45:16,712
That great cowboy killer.

1106
01:45:17,630 --> 01:45:19,180
What's he doing?
Hiding?

1107
01:45:21,050 --> 01:45:22,343
Gannon!

1108
01:45:28,558 --> 01:45:32,520
I'm the all time
champion cowboy killer!

1109
01:45:40,194 --> 01:45:42,344
Sorry, deputy,
drop it right there.

1110
01:45:44,907 --> 01:45:47,702
- Get inside the cage.
- What is this?

1111
01:45:47,868 --> 01:45:51,580
- Inside.
- What do you think you're doing?

1112
01:45:52,498 --> 01:45:55,948
You're a brave man,
but Tom Morgan is my responsibility.

1113
01:45:59,922 --> 01:46:01,173
Gannon!

1114
01:46:01,799 --> 01:46:04,510
Crawl out of your hole,
you yellow-belly.

1115
01:46:05,052 --> 01:46:07,013
I'll run you out of town.

1116
01:46:10,850 --> 01:46:13,686
Gannon,
do I have to come in after you?

1117
01:46:13,894 --> 01:46:15,354
Morgan!

1118
01:46:18,065 --> 01:46:19,400
Morgan.

1119
01:46:27,241 --> 01:46:28,659
Hello, Clay.

1120
01:46:37,877 --> 01:46:40,421
- Let me kill him, Clay.
- No, Morgan.

1121
01:46:40,713 --> 01:46:43,257
Why? Because you think
you owe Lily?

1122
01:46:43,424 --> 01:46:46,927
This isn't a game you can cheat
and make a fraud of.

1123
01:46:47,094 --> 01:46:49,794
I'm going to have to
run you out of town.

1124
01:46:56,062 --> 01:46:57,897
Then, I won.

1125
01:46:58,439 --> 01:47:02,651
Clay, you run me out of town,
I'll go like a lamb.

1126
01:47:04,028 --> 01:47:07,782
You'll be a hero again.
That's all I want.

1127
01:47:09,742 --> 01:47:12,286
- I've won.
- All right, you've won.

1128
01:47:12,953 --> 01:47:15,789
We'll play this out till the end,
just as you wanted.

1129
01:47:15,790 --> 01:47:18,250
I'm telling you to leave town.

1130
01:47:19,084 --> 01:47:20,377
All right.

1131
01:47:21,295 --> 01:47:24,172
- I'll see you in Palfrie City.
- No, you won't.

1132
01:47:24,173 --> 01:47:27,051
- You'll be there.
- No, Morgan.

1133
01:47:31,847 --> 01:47:33,599
I'll be waiting for you.

1134
01:47:35,017 --> 01:47:37,061
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1135
01:47:37,561 --> 01:47:39,647
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1136
01:48:02,461 --> 01:48:06,507
- I'll tell you something, Clay.
- What is it, Morgan?

1137
01:48:08,092 --> 01:48:12,012
I'm better than you.
I've always been better.

1138
01:48:14,139 --> 01:48:18,519
I can beat you, Clay.
You hit it.

1139
01:48:20,187 --> 01:48:22,147
And you better hit it fast.

1140
01:48:33,409 --> 01:48:35,119
I won, Clay.

1141
01:48:36,203 --> 01:48:37,454
I won.

1142
01:48:53,053 --> 01:48:55,222
Get your hands off him.

1143
01:49:52,029 --> 01:49:53,530
Say something.

1144
01:49:57,159 --> 01:49:58,702
Say something!

1145
01:50:03,248 --> 01:50:06,627
- He'd have killed somebody.
- He broke my arm.

1146
01:50:07,252 --> 01:50:10,002
- He was after trouble.
- What are you worth?

1147
01:50:10,964 --> 01:50:13,264
He was out to kill somebody,
marshal.

1148
01:50:14,009 --> 01:50:16,970
- Who? You?
- Might've been me.

1149
01:50:18,013 --> 01:50:21,141
- What are you worth?
- The Lord delivers.

1150
01:50:24,019 --> 01:50:25,229
Judge me.

1151
01:50:27,022 --> 01:50:29,650
You judged him, judge me now.

1152
01:50:31,443 --> 01:50:32,903
Judge me.

1153
01:50:34,613 --> 01:50:36,198
What will you do?

1154
01:50:36,406 --> 01:50:38,826
Kill all of us for your pain?

1155
01:50:50,212 --> 01:50:53,632
I've had too much of you.
Crawl for it.

1156
01:50:54,466 --> 01:50:57,636
Crawl past him.
He was a man, not all talk.

1157
01:51:13,610 --> 01:51:15,237
Take your hats off.

1158
01:51:18,198 --> 01:51:19,825
Take your hats off!

1159
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:24,037
Now, you can sing.

1160
01:51:29,543 --> 01:51:31,169
Sing!

1161
01:52:04,661 --> 01:52:06,163
Stand back.

1162
01:52:30,771 --> 01:52:32,481
Johnny, he'll kill you.

1163
01:52:43,241 --> 01:52:44,826
Stand back, deputy.

1164
01:52:47,037 --> 01:52:48,997
Sorry, Blaisdell, it's time.

1165
01:52:49,206 --> 01:52:51,500
- Time?
- You can't stay here.

1166
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,503
Trouble and death follow you.
Warlock's had enough of both.

1167
01:52:55,504 --> 01:52:58,131
- Are you running me out of town?
- No.

1168
01:52:58,340 --> 01:53:01,175
I'm just saying I'll have to
arrest you in the morning,

1169
01:53:01,176 --> 01:53:03,094
so I'm asking you to get out
before.

1170
01:53:03,095 --> 01:53:06,055
Nobody tells me that.
I come and go as I please.

1171
01:53:06,056 --> 01:53:10,352
No longer, Mr. Blaisdell.
I'll have to come after you.

1172
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:12,604
Come shooting, if you do.

1173
01:53:12,979 --> 01:53:15,148
- I'll do that.
- You'll have to.

1174
01:53:59,484 --> 01:54:03,697
I told Blaisdell
he's to get out of town by morning.

1175
01:54:05,532 --> 01:54:06,867
I heard.

1176
01:54:08,410 --> 01:54:10,078
And is he going?

1177
01:54:12,289 --> 01:54:13,498
No.

1178
01:54:40,066 --> 01:54:44,279
What do you want?
Your whole life in one night?

1179
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:53,330
Johnny.

1180
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:26,696
Clay.

1181
01:55:28,406 --> 01:55:30,283
I've been looking for you.

1182
01:55:31,451 --> 01:55:33,551
Have you been here
all this time?

1183
01:55:34,329 --> 01:55:39,042
- Jessie, why did he do it?
- I don't know.

1184
01:55:42,128 --> 01:55:45,882
- Clay, what are you going to do?
- Yesterday...

1185
01:55:47,967 --> 01:55:52,389
Was it only yesterday? I told him
he was nothing without me.

1186
01:55:54,307 --> 01:55:56,476
Maybe I'm nothing
without him.

1187
01:55:56,976 --> 01:55:58,686
That's foolish.

1188
01:56:00,772 --> 01:56:05,025
We had a council meeting and everyone
agreed that if you wanted to stay

1189
01:56:05,026 --> 01:56:07,986
we could go to the deputy,
I'm sure there'd be no problem.

1190
01:56:07,987 --> 01:56:10,115
What would I do here?

1191
01:56:11,241 --> 01:56:13,159
Stay with me, as we planned.

1192
01:56:13,326 --> 01:56:16,663
- What would I do?
- I don't know.

1193
01:56:17,747 --> 01:56:20,797
Whatever you planned on doing
before this happened.

1194
01:56:21,584 --> 01:56:23,795
I never saw past this morning.

1195
01:56:24,462 --> 01:56:26,881
I suppose I figured
Morgan and I...

1196
01:56:28,925 --> 01:56:30,176
What now?

1197
01:56:31,803 --> 01:56:36,182
Shall I clerk in Richardson's store?
Sell needles to old ladies?

1198
01:56:36,850 --> 01:56:39,700
Should I take over McQuown's
and nurse calves?

1199
01:56:40,436 --> 01:56:43,106
Become a miner
and live in darkness?

1200
01:56:44,482 --> 01:56:47,682
If you loved me,
none of these things would be bad.

1201
01:56:49,154 --> 01:56:50,738
Jessie, come with me.

1202
01:56:51,197 --> 01:56:54,747
We'll go to Palfrie City.
I can become the marshal there.

1203
01:56:54,868 --> 01:56:57,996
- To another town, and another...
- Why not?

1204
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:02,082
It's the way I've lived,
it's the way I'll always live.

1205
01:57:02,083 --> 01:57:03,960
Times are changing, sure,

1206
01:57:04,127 --> 01:57:06,962
but there'll be enough towns
to last my lifetime.

1207
01:57:06,963 --> 01:57:10,300
I'm not Morgan.
I can't back you.

1208
01:57:10,675 --> 01:57:13,595
I can't even hold a Colt,
much less fire one.

1209
01:57:13,761 --> 01:57:16,723
Who'll kill the backshooters
in Palfrie City?

1210
01:57:21,519 --> 01:57:23,969
Maybe I'll have to find
another Morgan.

1211
01:57:43,833 --> 01:57:44,918
Morning.

1212
01:58:02,101 --> 01:58:06,981
There's the key,
the judge has got the other one.

1213
01:58:16,449 --> 01:58:17,909
Take care of it.

1214
01:58:21,287 --> 01:58:25,708
People are out.
Funny how they find out about things.

1215
01:58:27,085 --> 01:58:28,378
Yeah...

1216
01:58:32,799 --> 01:58:34,050
Well...

1217
01:58:35,718 --> 01:58:39,222
- I guess it's about time.
- Chilly out.

1218
01:58:41,557 --> 01:58:42,809
Yeah.
