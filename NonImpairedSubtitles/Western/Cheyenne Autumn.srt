1
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,057
<i>The beginning of a day.</i>

2
00:03:39,702 --> 00:03:43,866
<i>September 7th, 1878.</i>

3
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:48,935
<i>It dawned like any other day</i>
<i>on the Cheyenne reservation...</i>

4
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:53,014
<i>... in that vast barren land</i>
<i>in the American Southwest...</i>

5
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:56,583
<i>... which was then called</i>
<i>Indian Territory.</i>

6
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:22,532
<i>But this wasn't just</i>
<i>another day to the Cheyenne.</i>

7
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,539
<i>Far from their homeland...</i>

8
00:05:24,707 --> 00:05:28,473
<i>... as out of place in this desert</i>
<i>as eagles in a cage...</i>

9
00:05:28,644 --> 00:05:32,341
<i>... their three great chiefs</i>
<i>prayed over the sacred bundle...</i>

10
00:05:32,515 --> 00:05:34,710
<i>... that at last,</i>
<i>the promises made to them...</i>

11
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:37,717
<i>... when the white man sent them here</i>
<i>more than a year ago...</i>

12
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:39,878
<i>... would today be honored.</i>

13
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:43,617
<i>The promises that had led them</i>
<i>to give up their own way of life...</i>

14
00:05:43,793 --> 00:05:50,289
<i>... in their own green and fertile country,</i>
<i>1500 miles to the north.</i>

15
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:45,512
- Good morning, Wichowsky.
- Troops all present or accounted for, sir.

16
00:06:45,688 --> 00:06:47,485
Thank you.

17
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,456
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

18
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:27,993
Can I steal some of your coffee?

19
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:31,327
- Help yourself.
- Thanks.

20
00:07:34,337 --> 00:07:35,770
Any news?

21
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:38,270
Here comes another name now.

22
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:41,873
- Senator.
- Great.

23
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:45,275
Looks like we're gonna be up
to our ears in congressmen.

24
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:47,973
Well, the more the better.

25
00:07:48,317 --> 00:07:53,152
I wish every bigwig in Washington
could see this place.

26
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:12,073
Deborah, they're here already.

27
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:57,843
Lord knows when
the Congressional Committee will arrive.

28
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:01,718
I don't blame them for being early.

29
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:05,054
You and I know what this means
to them, uncle.

30
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:21,239
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J...

31
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:26,712
...K., L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S,
T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

32
00:09:26,882 --> 00:09:29,282
Wonderful.
Come help me set the table.

33
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,249
Attention!

34
00:09:38,427 --> 00:09:40,952
- Scott.
- Good morning, sir.

35
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:43,059
- Sergeant.
- Good morning, sir.

36
00:09:43,232 --> 00:09:45,132
- Archer.
- Good morning, sir.

37
00:09:50,973 --> 00:09:53,942
- Indians, huh?
- Yep.

38
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,738
Any word
from the Congressional Party?

39
00:09:56,912 --> 00:09:59,881
They haven't left Fort Scott yet.

40
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,545
Well, let me know. Keep me advised.

41
00:10:02,718 --> 00:10:04,379
Yes, sir.

42
00:10:05,788 --> 00:10:08,586
Wichowsky, put the men at ease.

43
00:10:08,758 --> 00:10:10,783
Let them smoke...

44
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:17,092
...if they've got anything to smoke,
which I doubt.

45
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:19,200
At ease!

46
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,302
You're ready to smoke!

47
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:28,909
- Good morning, friend Thomas.
- Good morning, friend Deborah.

48
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:32,971
Well, now, where have you been
hiding that dress?

49
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:36,050
That's pretty stylish for a Quaker.

50
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:38,512
I made it just for this great day.

51
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:40,315
It's mighty pretty.

52
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:42,650
Do you know when they'll arrive?

53
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:45,259
Well, you can't expect speed
from congressmen...

54
00:10:45,428 --> 00:10:48,920
...but they ought to be here
any minute now.

55
00:10:49,098 --> 00:10:51,931
Well, I'd offer to help you,
but I can see you don't need it.

56
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:53,398
Oh, don't I, now?

57
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:57,494
Well, the leg on the senator's chair
seems to be stuck.

58
00:10:57,673 --> 00:10:59,538
Senator, huh?

59
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:02,439
Well, let's see what's wrong.

60
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:11,744
There we are.

61
00:11:13,322 --> 00:11:15,984
All neat and tidy for the senator.

62
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,417
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Anytime.

63
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:41,072
Friend Deborah,
where do you want the senator's chair?

64
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,343
I think I'll put him
at the head of the table.

65
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,146
He'd like that.

66
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:32,693
Plumtree, go down the road.

67
00:12:32,868 --> 00:12:35,666
Let us know when those gentlemen
from the East arrive.

68
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,959
<i>Hour after hour</i>
<i>they waited under the hot sun.</i>

69
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:03,155
<i>Waited for the moment</i>
<i>when their prayer would be answered.</i>

70
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:07,098
<i>When the white chiefs from Washington</i>
<i>would see for themselves...</i>

71
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:09,829
<i>... how the Cheyenne</i>
<i>had been forgotten.</i>

72
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,092
- Archer!
- Yes, sir.

73
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:42,669
When is that blasted party
coming anyway?

74
00:13:42,838 --> 00:13:46,399
- I don't know, sir.
- You don't know, sir.

75
00:13:49,144 --> 00:13:50,634
- Hey, you.
- Sir.

76
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:52,678
Any news on that party
from the East yet?

77
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:54,372
No. No, sir. Nothing since 11:30.

78
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,541
Eleven-thirty?

79
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:02,155
- Do you realize it's 5:30 now?
- Yes, sir.

80
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,601
Archer, see what he wants.

81
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:31,607
Plumtree.

82
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:36,274
I ain't a-getting paid for thinking, sir
but I don't think them folks is a-coming.

83
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,022
Just came in from Fort Reno, sir.

84
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,134
I'll be damned!

85
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:58,672
"Congressional Committee delayed
by bumpy roads and dust storms.

86
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:05,303
Decided to return to Reno in order
to rest up for the Officers' Ball tonight."

87
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:08,509
You mean
they're not coming here at all?

88
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:26,729
How long do they expect me to wait
to build some barracks out here?

89
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:30,235
Archer, I'm going to Fort Reno,
see to it.

90
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,901
Friend major, please...

91
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:38,069
...will you tell them about the medicine
and the food the Indians need?

92
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,681
And all the things
that were promised?

93
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:44,981
Uncle, you must make him listen.

94
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,282
How can I?

95
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:50,721
You know what he thinks of Quakers.

96
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:52,827
You've been here from the beginning.

97
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:57,432
You've watched them die of smallpox
and measles and malaria.

98
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,592
You've watched them starve.
Haven't you anything to say?

99
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,633
Nothing that you can't say better.

100
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:34,968
Major Braden!

101
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:38,935
I'm asking you to plead for justice.

102
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:41,042
I'm asking you to make them realize...

103
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,804
...that over a thousand Cheyenne
were brought here...

104
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:47,676
...and only 286 are left alive.

105
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:55,484
Miss Wright, my responsibility to the Indians
is only to guard them.

106
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:58,421
When you have reached my age,
you will have realized...

107
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:01,427
...that it pays to stick
to your own knitting.

108
00:18:01,597 --> 00:18:04,589
That's exactly what I intend to do.

109
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,045
Dull Knife! Little Wolf!

110
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:38,096
What happened today
changes nothing.

111
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:40,667
The Indian Bureau
is still pledged to provide you...

112
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:43,600
...with adequate clothing and rations.

113
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:46,969
You are still pledged
to abide by the law.

114
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,867
Remember that.

115
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:55,679
We are asked to remember much.

116
00:18:56,752 --> 00:19:01,553
The white man remembers nothing.

117
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:08,961
You spoke the truth for us.

118
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:14,969
This we will not forget.

119
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:20,366
But there will be no more school.

120
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:22,340
Oh, no.

121
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:24,741
Oh, no, please don't do that
to the children.

122
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:28,007
The white man's words are lies!

123
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:34,747
It is better that our children
not learn them.

124
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,217
It is not the words,
but who speaks them.

125
00:19:39,394 --> 00:19:42,363
Has speaking white men's words
made you a liar?

126
00:19:42,531 --> 00:19:45,762
Our words were learned long ago.

127
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:49,198
When some white men
still spoke truth.

128
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,563
<i>And so began, what to most people...</i>

129
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:24,729
<i>... must seem to be</i>
<i>only a footnote in history.</i>

130
00:20:46,061 --> 00:20:47,585
It ain't in my department, sir...

131
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:52,393
...but looks to me
like them kids is a-playing hooky.

132
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:28,392
You're gonna be pretty lonesome,
friend School Teacher.

133
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,595
No scholars.

134
00:21:31,273 --> 00:21:33,070
They'll come.

135
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:34,765
When?

136
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:18,944
Spanish Woman!

137
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:36,728
Friend Deborah, leave this place.

138
00:22:36,905 --> 00:22:40,170
Friend Thomas, you know
I came here to carry out a task.

139
00:22:40,342 --> 00:22:41,809
I can't leave now.

140
00:22:41,977 --> 00:22:43,740
Bunking in this schoolhouse
won't help.

141
00:22:43,912 --> 00:22:47,313
It will show them
that I'm on their side.

142
00:22:47,482 --> 00:22:50,417
Not unless you can change color.

143
00:22:51,253 --> 00:22:54,120
You know what they call whites?

144
00:22:55,757 --> 00:22:57,622
- And <i>veho</i> means "spider"!
- Means "spider"!

145
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,158
That's right.

146
00:22:59,327 --> 00:23:02,558
- That's what they think of all of us.
- And why shouldn't they?

147
00:23:02,731 --> 00:23:05,529
How many Cheyennes have you fought?
How many have you killed?

148
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,466
Deborah, look, will you take
the blinders off just for once?

149
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:14,302
You claim no self-respecting Quaker
could fall in love with a soldier...

150
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,274
...but you've fallen in love
with a whole tribe of them.

151
00:23:17,446 --> 00:23:18,811
Have you ever seen a Cheyenne?

152
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,948
- Of course, I have.
- No, you haven't!

153
00:23:21,116 --> 00:23:25,815
All you've seen is reservation Indians,
looking pitiful as fish out of water.

154
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:29,718
But give them a chance, they're
the greatest fighters in the world.

155
00:23:31,426 --> 00:23:33,690
Will you listen to me?

156
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:37,723
It takes a blue coat to make
a white man a soldier.

157
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:42,131
But a Cheyenne is a soldier
from the first slap on his bottom.

158
00:23:42,304 --> 00:23:46,536
War is his life.
He's fierce, he's smart.

159
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:49,199
And he's meaner than sin.

160
00:23:49,978 --> 00:23:56,042
Possibly you can only think of the past,
but I'm here to think about the future.

161
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:05,582
All right.

162
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,027
You think of the future.

163
00:24:20,942 --> 00:24:22,569
Want some help?

164
00:24:22,744 --> 00:24:24,644
I'll manage.

165
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:33,050
Better keep that lamp lit tonight.

166
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:45,923
And if anything happens,
ring the bell.

167
00:27:32,534 --> 00:27:34,161
- Little Wolf.
- Yes?

168
00:27:34,336 --> 00:27:37,271
- What's happened?
- This is not the place for you.

169
00:28:26,921 --> 00:28:28,286
Spanish Woman...

170
00:28:30,158 --> 00:28:32,023
...where are they going?

171
00:28:32,193 --> 00:28:34,423
- Home.
- Home?

172
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:38,591
What you call Yellowstone country.

173
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,266
What about the children?

174
00:28:43,037 --> 00:28:44,334
They are Cheyenne.

175
00:28:45,373 --> 00:28:46,931
But who will care for them?

176
00:28:47,275 --> 00:28:49,709
We will do what we can.

177
00:28:49,878 --> 00:28:51,277
They are Cheyenne.

178
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:12,357
Dull Knife, the old chief
is much too sick.

179
00:29:12,534 --> 00:29:14,468
He'll never make such a trip.
Let...

180
00:29:14,636 --> 00:29:17,230
If he lives to ride
even a mile closer to home...

181
00:29:17,405 --> 00:29:19,566
...he will die as a man should.

182
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:21,641
There will be no more dying
in this place.

183
00:30:34,782 --> 00:30:36,579
They've skipped.

184
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:40,011
Thank God.

185
00:30:40,188 --> 00:30:42,019
What the hell do you mean by that?

186
00:30:42,624 --> 00:30:45,457
I've waited since I was 10 years old
for this chance.

187
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:46,855
Then you're a damned idiot.

188
00:30:47,028 --> 00:30:49,155
I want D Troop ready
and mounted in 10 minutes.

189
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,628
E Troop and wagons to follow
under your command.

190
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:53,699
No artillery. Plumtree!

191
00:30:53,868 --> 00:30:55,768
- Come here!
- Yes, sir!

192
00:33:27,889 --> 00:33:30,585
E Troop and train reporting, sir.

193
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:33,259
You brought the wagons
along too fast, Mr. Scott.

194
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,453
Draft animals can't stand it.

195
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,461
They can rest up tonight.

196
00:33:37,632 --> 00:33:39,463
They can?

197
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:43,125
Well, that's an assumption
you had no right to make.

198
00:33:43,304 --> 00:33:45,204
We're gonna keep moving.

199
00:33:45,373 --> 00:33:47,841
That's fine with me, sir.

200
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,074
- Scott, tell me something.
- Sir?

201
00:33:51,245 --> 00:33:53,941
What put the blood in your eye?

202
00:33:54,148 --> 00:33:55,672
It's just a private matter, sir.

203
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:59,445
Nothing that affects
an officer's conduct is private.

204
00:34:01,889 --> 00:34:06,417
My father died
in the Fetterman Massacre back in '66.

205
00:34:07,261 --> 00:34:10,788
Mother and I were at the fort
when they brought his body in.

206
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:14,494
I was only 10 years old.

207
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,897
Until that time,
I never wanted to be a soldier.

208
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:21,007
Well, that doesn't give you
a personal license to kill Indians.

209
00:34:21,175 --> 00:34:23,143
The job of this Army
is to keep the peace.

210
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,006
I understand, sir.

211
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,908
You do, huh?

212
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:28,844
Well, just make sure you understand...

213
00:34:29,016 --> 00:34:32,247
...these Cheyenne broke no law
when they left the Agency.

214
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,911
And they won't
unless they cross the river.

215
00:34:35,123 --> 00:34:37,387
So if you provoke trouble...

216
00:34:37,558 --> 00:34:40,425
...I’ll see that you lose
those shoulder straps...

217
00:34:40,595 --> 00:34:43,530
...if I have to tear them off myself.

218
00:34:44,031 --> 00:34:45,726
Understood?

219
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,232
Understood, sir.

220
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,371
Mr. Scott!

221
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,308
Sir?

222
00:35:03,751 --> 00:35:05,685
I knew your father.

223
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:08,822
- Guide on!
- Sir.

224
00:35:26,641 --> 00:35:29,166
Troop, halt!

225
00:35:55,837 --> 00:35:58,101
Prepare to dismount!

226
00:35:58,306 --> 00:36:01,400
Prepare to dismount!

227
00:36:02,643 --> 00:36:05,578
Dismount!

228
00:36:20,027 --> 00:36:22,518
- Sir!
- Yes.

229
00:36:22,697 --> 00:36:24,562
Are you going to let them jump
the reservation right bef?

230
00:36:24,732 --> 00:36:26,563
They haven't jumped the reservation.

231
00:36:26,734 --> 00:36:28,964
They haven't crossed the river yet.

232
00:36:29,136 --> 00:36:33,232
- Sir, I most respectfully object to...
- Put it in writing.

233
00:36:33,407 --> 00:36:35,807
Join your troop, mister.

234
00:37:04,272 --> 00:37:05,899
Sir.

235
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,704
No. No, thanks.

236
00:38:46,207 --> 00:38:48,539
Spanish Woman, what's happening?

237
00:38:49,477 --> 00:38:51,342
I think war.

238
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:54,245
Spanish Woman, speak to Dull Knife.

239
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,712
He'll listen to you.

240
00:38:57,551 --> 00:38:59,644
I can do nothing.

241
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,549
Nothing.

242
00:39:29,683 --> 00:39:31,708
- School teacher.
- Little Wolf, you promised...

243
00:39:31,886 --> 00:39:34,787
Take the children, join the others.

244
00:40:55,402 --> 00:40:58,496
Troop, halt!

245
00:40:58,672 --> 00:41:02,108
Troop, halt!

246
00:41:14,855 --> 00:41:16,880
- Plumtree.
- Sir?

247
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:19,688
I don't like the look of it.

248
00:41:20,494 --> 00:41:22,553
Take a look up that canyon.

249
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,721
- Yes, sir.
- Jones, you cover him.

250
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:30,169
Jones!

251
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:32,938
Name's Smith, sir.

252
00:41:33,107 --> 00:41:36,304
Oh, well, go on up with him. Go on!

253
00:42:28,362 --> 00:42:29,886
- All right?
- Yes, sir.

254
00:42:30,064 --> 00:42:33,124
But that canyon there
is plumb full of Indians.

255
00:42:33,334 --> 00:42:37,634
- On ride into line! Yo!
- Hey, Smitty, wait a minute.

256
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,797
On ride into line! Yo!

257
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,740
You've got a lot to explain
to a court martial, Archer.

258
00:43:23,917 --> 00:43:25,475
Sergeant...

259
00:43:28,122 --> 00:43:29,453
Cannon's ready?

260
00:43:29,623 --> 00:43:31,887
Forward on the double!

261
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:35,256
Cannon forward on the double!

262
00:43:35,496 --> 00:43:37,361
Prepare to dismount!

263
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:40,591
- Prepare to dismount!
- Dismount!

264
00:43:40,801 --> 00:43:42,826
Now!

265
00:43:46,907 --> 00:43:48,738
Motion!

266
00:43:53,781 --> 00:43:56,409
All soldiers to the rear!

267
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:58,584
All soldiers to the rear!

268
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,044
Stop!

269
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,458
- Major, I've got to tell you...
- Go back to your troop.

270
00:44:13,634 --> 00:44:16,159
...the majority of those people
are women and children!

271
00:44:16,337 --> 00:44:19,465
- Maybe 50 or 60 warriors.
- Archer, you're under arrest.

272
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,632
Number one gun, fire!

273
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:25,540
Number two gun, fire!

274
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,401
Fire number one.

275
00:44:48,669 --> 00:44:50,227
Fire.

276
00:46:04,111 --> 00:46:06,204
Cease firing!

277
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,075
Where's the major?

278
00:46:17,257 --> 00:46:19,452
- Is he?
- Yes, sir.

279
00:47:05,873 --> 00:47:11,607
They're angry because my son fired
the first shot.

280
00:47:15,849 --> 00:47:19,376
Does it ever matter
who fires the first shot?

281
00:47:30,731 --> 00:47:32,392
Those dirty, murdering...

282
00:47:32,566 --> 00:47:34,591
- The major's dead, sir.
- Pick up the horses.

283
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:36,736
- I said, the major's dead, sir!
- Shut up!

284
00:47:36,904 --> 00:47:38,269
Aren't you gonna give them a?

285
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:41,305
Plumtree, Brown,
get the horses off the wagons.

286
00:47:41,508 --> 00:47:42,497
- Yes, sir.
- Yo.

287
00:47:47,047 --> 00:47:50,483
- Name's Smith, sir.
- All right, get to work!

288
00:48:27,254 --> 00:48:30,621
My son says,
"The soldiers do not follow."

289
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:34,783
Dull Knife, you know the soldiers
will have to follow us.

290
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:38,726
Have you thought what will happen
to your wife and son?

291
00:48:38,899 --> 00:48:40,992
There will be war.

292
00:48:41,902 --> 00:48:45,929
- Little Wolf.
- These are my wives.

293
00:48:46,106 --> 00:48:49,200
I pray the young one
will give me sons.

294
00:48:49,476 --> 00:48:55,278
But I want them to be born where I
and all my people before me were born.

295
00:48:55,582 --> 00:48:58,676
Even a dog can go where he likes...

296
00:48:58,885 --> 00:49:01,115
...but not a Cheyenne.

297
00:49:03,957 --> 00:49:06,425
You may go where you like.

298
00:50:10,057 --> 00:50:11,820
No.

299
00:50:14,628 --> 00:50:16,289
No.

300
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,927
No.

301
00:50:32,713 --> 00:50:33,941
But...

302
00:53:05,165 --> 00:53:07,326
<i>The report</i>
<i>from the Army's field telegrapher...</i>

303
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,901
<i>... to headquarters in Omaha listed</i>
<i>only nine casualties incurred...</i>

304
00:53:11,071 --> 00:53:15,371
<i>... in the troop's first encounter</i>
<i>with the homeward-bound Cheyenne.</i>

305
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,240
<i>But by the time it came off</i>
<i>the press in Kansas City...</i>

306
00:53:21,414 --> 00:53:24,975
<i>... somehow it had</i>
<i>mysteriously grown to 29.</i>

307
00:53:29,923 --> 00:53:34,121
<i>And suddenly it expanded</i>
<i>to 59, 69, 109...</i>

308
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:38,697
<i>... when the news reached</i>
<i>the tiny hamlets of the Western Plains.</i>

309
00:53:39,933 --> 00:53:44,097
<i>Meanwhile, the Army was frantically</i>
<i>deploying troops along the 1200 miles...</i>

310
00:53:44,271 --> 00:53:48,105
<i>... that still lay between the Cheyenne</i>
<i>and their homeland.</i>

311
00:53:51,378 --> 00:53:54,745
<i>The railroads they had to cross</i>
<i>were patrolled.</i>

312
00:53:55,916 --> 00:53:58,043
<i>River crossings watched.</i>

313
00:53:59,753 --> 00:54:02,881
<i>The alarm was spreading</i>
<i>through the West.</i>

314
00:54:03,056 --> 00:54:06,514
<i>Settlers crossing the plains</i>
<i>demanded Army escorts.</i>

315
00:54:06,726 --> 00:54:10,526
<i>Or they rushed frantically</i>
<i>to the safety of Army posts.</i>

316
00:54:10,697 --> 00:54:14,098
<i>No one asked how many Indians</i>
<i>had escaped.</i>

317
00:54:14,301 --> 00:54:16,929
<i>The word Cheyenne was enough.</i>

318
00:54:17,103 --> 00:54:21,665
<i>And in Washington heated words</i>
<i>echoed through the Halls of Congress.</i>

319
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:23,934
<i>The Department of the Interior</i>
<i>was crowded...</i>

320
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:28,274
<i>... with western railroad tycoons,</i>
<i>mine owners and land speculators.</i>

321
00:54:28,481 --> 00:54:33,043
<i>All such people to whom Indian scares</i>
<i>meant lost dollars.</i>

322
00:54:33,219 --> 00:54:36,017
<i>While the generals came</i>
<i>to fix the blame on Carl Schurz...</i>

323
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:38,589
<i>... the Secretary of the Interior.</i>

324
00:54:38,792 --> 00:54:42,853
<i>In his misguided effort to eliminate</i>
<i>corruption in the Indian Bureau...</i>

325
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:46,055
<i>... it was Mr. Schurz who had brought</i>
<i>in the Quakers.</i>

326
00:54:46,232 --> 00:54:48,393
<i>And to the Army</i>
<i>it was obviously the Quakers...</i>

327
00:54:48,568 --> 00:54:50,832
<i>... who had encouraged</i>
<i>the Cheyenne to rebel.</i>

328
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:57,306
<i>In all the land there was not one voice</i>
<i>raised in behalf of the Cheyenne until...</i>

329
00:54:57,477 --> 00:55:01,038
In <i>The Sun,</i> the <i>Times, Chronicle.</i>

330
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:04,672
Take your pick. They're all saying
the same things we're saying:

331
00:55:04,851 --> 00:55:06,876
"Bloodthirsty savages on the loose.

332
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:10,784
Burning, killing,
violating beautiful white women!"

333
00:55:10,957 --> 00:55:12,822
It's not news anymore.

334
00:55:13,026 --> 00:55:14,687
We're gonna take a different tack.

335
00:55:14,861 --> 00:55:20,128
From now on, we're going to grieve
for the noble red man.

336
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:22,097
We'll sell more paper that way.

337
00:55:22,302 --> 00:55:24,896
Now, see to it!

338
00:55:31,811 --> 00:55:34,780
<i>But by now any rumor</i>
<i>could be believed.</i>

339
00:55:34,948 --> 00:55:39,578
<i>Because suddenly the news</i>
<i>from the West had stopped.</i>

340
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:43,385
<i>The Cheyenne and their pursuers</i>
<i>had disappeared into the emptiness...</i>

341
00:55:43,556 --> 00:55:47,083
<i>... and silence</i>
<i>of the thinly populated continent.</i>

342
00:55:57,971 --> 00:56:01,463
- Mr. Secretary.
- Come in. Come in.

343
00:56:01,641 --> 00:56:04,439
Good afternoon, Mr. Secretary.

344
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,476
Now, no matter
what you may have heard...

345
00:56:06,646 --> 00:56:09,945
We assure you there's nothing personal
about our proposed legislation.

346
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:12,744
The entire Senate
has the greatest respect for you...

347
00:56:12,919 --> 00:56:14,511
...you know that.

348
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:19,316
But all I know is that you're trying
to snatch the Indian Bureau away...

349
00:56:19,492 --> 00:56:22,723
...from my department
and hand it over to the Army.

350
00:56:23,596 --> 00:56:25,530
Mr. Senator?

351
00:56:25,698 --> 00:56:27,928
Have you ever seen a Cheyenne?

352
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:30,534
An Arapaho? Any Indian?

353
00:56:31,104 --> 00:56:34,471
Have you ever been west
of the Mississippi River?

354
00:56:34,674 --> 00:56:36,733
- What are driving at, sir?
- Well, just this.

355
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:40,505
Why are three eastern senators
suddenly so concerned about Indians?

356
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,944
Well, it's strictly
a matter of economy.

357
00:56:43,116 --> 00:56:45,050
The Army has to be out there anyway.

358
00:56:45,218 --> 00:56:47,550
Oh, so that's all it is.

359
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,655
I was afraid perhaps that some
of the dollar patriots...

360
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:54,021
...who are sleeping on my doorstep
might have been sleeping on yours.

361
00:56:54,194 --> 00:56:56,594
Sir, are you questioning
our honesty of purpose?

362
00:56:56,763 --> 00:56:59,493
No more than I question theirs.

363
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:02,066
Their honest purpose
is to grab every acre of land...

364
00:57:02,235 --> 00:57:03,998
...the Indians once thought
they owned.

365
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,694
You can't say that's Army policy.

366
00:57:05,872 --> 00:57:08,170
Well, I can say it amounts
to the same thing.

367
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:12,539
The smaller the reservations,
the easier they are to guard.

368
00:57:12,712 --> 00:57:14,475
You let the Army have its way...

369
00:57:14,647 --> 00:57:17,810
...and they'll end up the size
of postage stamps.

370
00:57:17,984 --> 00:57:19,849
Exactly what the land-grabbers want.

371
00:57:20,053 --> 00:57:21,918
We'll be late
for that committee meeting.

372
00:57:22,088 --> 00:57:25,683
- Excuse us, Mr. Secretary.
- Oh, Henry.

373
00:57:29,429 --> 00:57:32,330
You and I fought together
at Gettysburg...

374
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:37,234
...yet you'd never even seen
a Negro slave.

375
00:57:37,904 --> 00:57:39,735
All you ever knew...

376
00:57:39,906 --> 00:57:43,899
...is that they were human beings
with the rights of human beings.

377
00:57:44,911 --> 00:57:46,879
And it was worth an arm to you.

378
00:57:50,016 --> 00:57:55,477
Carl, I'll stall this legislation, but unless
those Cheyenne are found soon...

379
00:57:55,655 --> 00:57:59,557
...or if you make one false move,
God help you.

380
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,385
God help me.

381
00:58:32,225 --> 00:58:33,453
Leave us.

382
00:58:33,626 --> 00:58:38,086
When Little Wolf speaks <i>veho</i> words
they are for my ears alone.

383
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,106
This I say:

384
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,376
We have always thought as one.

385
00:58:56,182 --> 00:58:59,879
Never has the thickness
of a straw come between us.

386
00:59:00,053 --> 00:59:01,884
We still think as one.

387
00:59:02,989 --> 00:59:04,854
As war chief...

388
00:59:05,525 --> 00:59:08,892
...I may raise my hand only
against the enemy.

389
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:12,188
We still think as one.

390
00:59:21,274 --> 00:59:26,871
That is why
I must sleep with no wife...

391
00:59:27,447 --> 00:59:31,975
...saving all my strength for a fight
against the soldiers.

392
00:59:33,753 --> 00:59:35,653
But your son...

393
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:40,383
...tries to steal my youngest wife.

394
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,619
This cannot be.

395
00:59:43,029 --> 00:59:45,224
He is of my blood.

396
00:59:46,399 --> 00:59:48,230
And my blood has never been bad.

397
00:59:48,401 --> 00:59:50,562
He is of your blood...

398
00:59:51,271 --> 00:59:53,330
...but he is not you.

399
01:01:42,548 --> 01:01:44,607
Troop, halt!

400
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:47,378
Troop, halt!

401
01:01:47,553 --> 01:01:49,282
Sergeant.

402
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:51,286
Mr. Scott.

403
01:01:52,392 --> 01:01:54,155
Unlimber the guns!

404
01:01:54,761 --> 01:01:56,786
If we attack,
I think we're in for a beating.

405
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,863
- Here's what I want...
- Their backs are to the wall!

406
01:01:59,031 --> 01:02:01,522
And a lot of flat land to cross
before we get there.

407
01:02:01,701 --> 01:02:03,760
I'd rather force them to attack us.

408
01:02:03,936 --> 01:02:06,700
- Well, they ain't done nothing foolish yet.
- I know.

409
01:02:06,906 --> 01:02:09,340
- Take D Troop, get on their flanks.
- Sir.

410
01:02:09,509 --> 01:02:13,172
Mr. Scott, dismount half of E Troop
to protect the guns and wagons.

411
01:02:13,346 --> 01:02:15,940
Then you move out with the rest
to cover the right flank.

412
01:02:16,115 --> 01:02:17,810
Yes, sir.

413
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,884
And remember, Mr. Scott...

414
01:02:20,052 --> 01:02:24,751
...the trick to being brave
is not to be too brave.

415
01:02:24,924 --> 01:02:27,620
- Any questions?
- No questions, sir.

416
01:02:27,794 --> 01:02:29,227
Right.

417
01:02:29,395 --> 01:02:32,694
Plumtree, Murphy, take the point!

418
01:02:32,865 --> 01:02:35,595
Take the point. Yo!

419
01:03:40,867 --> 01:03:42,960
A little faster on there, come on.

420
01:03:43,135 --> 01:03:44,932
Hurry up there.

421
01:03:46,672 --> 01:03:47,934
You all right?

422
01:03:48,774 --> 01:03:51,641
Well, yes, sir.

423
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,048
On left, to the line.

424
01:04:03,823 --> 01:04:08,157
Forward at the walk. Yo!

425
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,899
Walk trot!

426
01:04:23,476 --> 01:04:27,469
- What in the hell is that kid doing?
- As you were.

427
01:04:28,915 --> 01:04:31,042
What the hell is he doing?

428
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:33,684
Canter!

429
01:04:49,402 --> 01:04:52,894
Company, charge!

430
01:05:18,631 --> 01:05:20,690
Mr. Scott!

431
01:05:26,906 --> 01:05:28,999
Scott!

432
01:05:29,875 --> 01:05:31,206
Damn you!

433
01:05:40,553 --> 01:05:42,919
Front left, into line!

434
01:05:43,089 --> 01:05:44,989
Yo!

435
01:05:51,897 --> 01:05:53,990
Prepare to dismount.

436
01:07:16,415 --> 01:07:18,383
- Get the guns out!
- They're at the wagons.

437
01:07:18,551 --> 01:07:20,644
- Get the guns. Move!
- Yes, sir.

438
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,850
- Come on, move it.
- Come on.

439
01:07:24,023 --> 01:07:25,752
- Get them out of there.
- Let's go.

440
01:07:25,925 --> 01:07:28,689
Come on. Come on.
Get out of there.

441
01:07:56,856 --> 01:07:59,324
Mr. Scott!

442
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:04,125
- I told you to cover that flank.
- I'm sorry, sir.

443
01:08:04,296 --> 01:08:07,356
From now on, you don't scratch
till I itch, is that clear?

444
01:08:07,533 --> 01:08:09,125
Yes, sir.

445
01:08:13,038 --> 01:08:15,233
Plumtree, Thompson.

446
01:08:19,245 --> 01:08:21,145
Here, let me help.

447
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:28,881
Sir...

448
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,814
<i>Despite the Indian scare,</i>
<i>an occasional cattle herd...</i>

449
01:09:03,989 --> 01:09:06,219
<i>... still came up the Chisholm Trail</i>
<i>from Texas...</i>

450
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:09,327
<i>... to the railhead</i>
<i>in Dodge City, Kansas.</i>

451
01:09:09,495 --> 01:09:11,258
<i>Sometimes the hungry Cheyenne...</i>

452
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:14,194
<i>... were able to pick up</i>
<i>a few stray cows.</i>

453
01:09:14,366 --> 01:09:19,326
<i>And sometimes they even begged</i>
<i>for charity from the tough trailhands.</i>

454
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:42,723
Yo, there.

455
01:09:53,639 --> 01:09:55,903
Jessie, Homer, Shug.
Come here. Come here.

456
01:09:56,075 --> 01:09:58,202
Hey, come on. Come here.

457
01:09:58,844 --> 01:10:02,371
Slow down.

458
01:10:09,188 --> 01:10:12,783
Lookit there.
Real blanket-head Injuns.

459
01:10:49,261 --> 01:10:51,627
I sure would like to have me
that little paint.

460
01:10:51,797 --> 01:10:55,460
And I sure would like
to kill me an Injun.

461
01:10:55,634 --> 01:10:59,627
Can't you gut-eaters
talk any Texican?

462
01:10:59,805 --> 01:11:03,707
Yes, sir. I'd sure love
to kill me an Injun.

463
01:11:03,876 --> 01:11:05,901
I dare you, Homer.

464
01:11:06,078 --> 01:11:09,172
- You dare me?
- I dare you.

465
01:12:08,173 --> 01:12:12,542
I always wanted
to kill me an Injun.

466
01:12:12,711 --> 01:12:14,508
All them old-timers back home...

467
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:17,945
...a- hoorahing about
how many scalps they've took.

468
01:12:18,117 --> 01:12:21,848
Jessie, that's one of them there,
one of them there Cheyenne.

469
01:12:22,021 --> 01:12:24,285
We better skedaddle
and get that herd out of here.

470
01:12:24,456 --> 01:12:28,449
- Let's go.
- Not till I get my scalp, we won't.

471
01:13:26,618 --> 01:13:30,577
G-O-O-D. Good.
