from the outside.

they weren't high enough
to hold you in.

That's right.

11
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:56,875
I have a story here.
Wrote it myself.

12
00:02:57,295 --> 00:02:58,503
It's about me.

13
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:00,773
I think it might
interest people.

14
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,130
Well, I'd like to read
your story, but...
There's no hurry.

15
00:03:04,737 --> 00:03:06,839
I'm leaving town
on the afternoon train.

16

a book of it,
I'd be much obliged.

Not when a man's

Sometimes, it seems like
he enjoys it,
whipping and praying.

Seems like the time
has to come when a man

Law books!

There's no more law in Texas.

Only Yankee law!
It won't always be that way.

I'm tired of waiting.

80

There's a million
head of cattle in Texas,

belonging to nobody
because of the war.

83

A man just has to
round up a few cattle

and brand them
and drive them
to the railroad.

these mavericks.

or $300 for an outfit
and a good cow pony.

00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:31,018
I can raise it.

the only thing
you can do, Wes.

157
00:10:43,271 --> 00:10:45,156
Now that you're a lawyer,
how would you figure
that one out?

158
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,200
Well, I...

159
00:10:47,456 --> 00:10:49,209
Don't forget the kitty, boys.

160
00:10:50,715 --> 00:10:51,923
I'll take one.

161
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:03,617
I'll buy two and check.

162
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,016
It'll cost you 50 to play.

163
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,629
I got three kings.
They're no good.

164
00:11:16,462 --> 00:11:17,801
I got a flush.

165
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:20,831
You gave me four clubs
going in

166
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:22,393
and you just gave me
this one.

167
00:11:23,713 --> 00:11:25,118
Where'd you get that card?

168
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:26,743
You gave it to me.

169
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:29,202
I gave you a heart!
Why, you...

170
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:34,500
Wes. Look out.
Drop it, Marv!

171
00:11:35,692 --> 00:11:37,118
Put your hands up.

172
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:41,303
You all saw it.
He drew first.

173
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:43,100
Get out quick, Wes.
He's got three brothers.

174
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:44,627
They won't ask
who drew first.

175
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:46,226
Put my money
in my hat, Rosie.

176
00:11:48,853 --> 00:11:50,225
Keep your hands up!

177
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:52,716
Put it in
my saddlebag.

178
00:11:53,517 --> 00:11:55,619
First man out this door
gets shot!

179
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:57,599
Stay put till
you hear me ride!

180
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:06,540
Wes, look out!

181
00:12:08,722 --> 00:12:10,247
Take care of yourself, Rosie.

182
00:12:10,927 --> 00:12:12,811
Take care of yourself,

There he goes, down the road.

Line up against the bar.
All of you.

188
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:48,618

Murder in the first degree.

That means he's real dead.</i>

What's the name of the man
who shot him?

191
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,719
Name? Oh, my name is Marv.
Everybody calls me Marv.

192
00:12:54,787 --> 00:12:56,345
I've been tending
bar here for...
Not your name.

193
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:57,659
The name of the man
who did the shooting.

194
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,382
Hey, mister...
I mean, Lieutenant.

195
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:01,520
I don't think he saw it.
He couldn't see that far.

196
00:13:01,591 --> 00:13:04,074
You seem to see plenty
around here. You see it?

197
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,821
No, no, but he did.

198
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,970
Did you see the shooting?

199
00:13:08,044 --> 00:13:09,351
I see nothing.

200
00:13:09,418 --> 00:13:12,674
Ain't seen my wife
in a week.
What time is it?

201
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,256
Everybody's gone blind
and dumb around here
at the same time.

you ain't gonna need

It's Wes Hardin.

Well, hello, Wes.
Step down. Come on in.

218
00:13:59,762 --> 00:14:01,799
Maybe I shouldn't.
I'm in trouble.

219
00:14:02,062 --> 00:14:04,164
Well, if you're in trouble,
you've come
to the right house.

Step down, come on in

Howdy, Aunt Em.

Morning, Wes.
Jim. Joe.

225
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:18,130
Wes.
Sit down, Wes.
Have some breakfast.

226
00:14:20,654 --> 00:14:22,179
What kind of trouble
you in, Wes?

227
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:25,695
I shot Gus Hanley.

228
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:28,862
Gus Hanley?
You killed him?

229
00:14:29,312 --> 00:14:30,487
Holy smoke!

230
00:14:30,557 --> 00:14:32,724
You started up
with that brood,
you should have got them all!

231
00:14:32,793 --> 00:14:35,123
He'll get his chance at
the rest of them as soon as
they come a-running.

232
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:37,902
Especially Dirk.
He's cut five notches
already.

233
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:39,013
Wes, what I say is...

234
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,155
You don't say nothing
till you're spoken to.

235
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:42,751
There's something else.

236
00:14:43,303 --> 00:14:46,048
I think maybe I shot
a couple of Yankees
getting out of town.

237
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,416
Yankees!

238
00:14:47,616 --> 00:14:49,107
What are you
trying to do, boy?

239
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,803
Start the war
all over again?

240
00:14:50,874 --> 00:14:53,423
JOE:
The Yankees don't count.
But the Hanleys do.

241
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:55,788
Does your pa
know about all this?

242
00:14:55,857 --> 00:14:57,643
I expect he's heard
about it by now.

243
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,378
JOHN:
Joe, go saddle a horse
and go on over to Bonham

244
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:03,615
and tell old Jehovah
that Wes is with us.

245
00:15:03,684 --> 00:15:06,200
John, that ain't a nice way
to talk about your brother.

246
00:15:06,464 --> 00:15:07,639
Half-brother!

247
00:15:08,347 --> 00:15:09,654
Pa don't have to know
where I am.

248
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:11,727
I expect he don't care.

249
00:15:11,798 --> 00:15:13,802
I cut loose from him
before all this.

250
00:15:13,874 --> 00:15:15,562
Joe, do as I say.

251
00:15:15,823 --> 00:15:18,851
Keep off the roads.
There'll be patrols
out looking for Wes.

252
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,880
Joe, when you see Jane,
tell her not to worry.

253
00:15:23,937 --> 00:15:25,820
Tell her I'll be back for her
like I said.

254
00:15:25,948 --> 00:15:29,140
You ain't going to Bonham,
not for a long time,
unless it's in a box.

255
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,408
When I'm ready
I'm going back for Jane.

256
00:15:31,603 --> 00:15:32,975
We got plans, Uncle John.

257
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:36,709
Don't matter
about the Hanleys
or the Yankees or Pa.

258
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:39,844
Well, let the Yankees
look for you.
Let them all look

259
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:41,407
'cause we won't be here.

260
00:15:41,762 --> 00:15:44,408
We'll be trailing a herd
to Abilene,
and you'll be with us.

261
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:45,718
So, you're ready
to make a drive?

262
00:15:45,786 --> 00:15:47,954
We can be ready
tomorrow morning.
Can't we, boys?

263
00:15:48,023 --> 00:15:50,256
We can be ready sooner
than that if you say so, Pa.

264
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:52,587
Joe?
Sure, Pa,
we'll be ready.

265
00:15:53,006 --> 00:15:55,207
Good. Get back
as soon as you can.

266
00:15:55,275 --> 00:15:57,954
Hey, Wes, what about Gus?
Did he draw first?

267
00:15:58,661 --> 00:15:59,674
You beat him, huh?

268
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,062
Well, what do you think?
He's here, ain't he?

269
00:16:15,751 --> 00:16:17,820
The fastest horse in Texas.
Yes, sir.

Hi.

271
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:21,846
Well, if it ain't
old Wes Hardin
sitting out here big as life

272
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,440
with half of Texas
looking for him.

273
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:25,397
You're a real
unpopular boy.

274
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:27,824
Got the three Hanley brothers
looking for him
in one direction,

275
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,033
promising to shoot him
on sight,

276
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:31,173
got half the Yankee Army
looking for him
in the other direction,

277
00:16:31,244 --> 00:16:32,355
making the same promise.

278
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:33,733
Hey, Zeke.

279
00:16:34,055 --> 00:16:35,841
That's a real good-Iooking
pony you got.

280
00:16:36,451 --> 00:16:37,529
Must have cost you plenty.

281
00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:39,125
Nah, didn't cost
me nothing.

282
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,951
That fool Yankee Major
down at the fort,

283
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:43,665
he confiscated this horse
from a ranch
up near Nacogdoches

284
00:16:43,734 --> 00:16:45,487
and all I done
was confiscate him back.

285
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:46,568
You mean you stole him?

286
00:16:46,737 --> 00:16:48,643
Well, no, not exactly.

287
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:52,606
You see, the Major wanted
to play a little poker with
old Zeke, so I obliged him.

288
00:16:52,807 --> 00:16:54,745
He got more cards
off the bottom
than he did off the top

289
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:56,474
and I got Rondo,

Hello, Zeke.
Oh, howdy, Joe.

292
00:16:59,163 --> 00:17:00,655
Got the road brand
on the last of them, Pa.

293
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:01,774

whenever you are.

294

Well, let's stop talking.
Take them to Abilene, boys.

295
00:17:04,211 --> 00:17:05,386
Run them along, Gyp.

296
00:17:05,456 --> 00:17:07,363
Jim, send one of the boys
back for the wagon.

old Chick Noonan.
Wonder what he wants.

JOHN:
Probably looking for a place
to bury his money.

300
00:17:48,263 --> 00:17:50,049
Hi, John. Hi, Wes.

301
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,678
What are you doing
on the trail?

302
00:17:51,744 --> 00:17:53,628
Trying to pick up
a little stray business?

303
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:56,176
I pick up business
anyplace I can find it.

304
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:57,967
Business was good
in Abilene.

305
00:17:58,037 --> 00:18:01,294
I had a special embalming
and burying job
on The Durango Kid.

306
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,851
And if I do say so myself,

307
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:05,474
when he was laid out,
his own wife
didn't even know him.

308

asleep in the parlor.

(CHICK LAUGHS)

310
00:18:11,486 --> 00:18:13,555
Been any recent deaths
in Bonham?

311
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:17,043
No, not that I know of.

312
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,724
Not to change
the subject, John,

313
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:22,689
did you ever buy
that new black suit
you said you was going to?

314
00:18:22,955 --> 00:18:24,446
No. Why?

315
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:27,902
You never can tell.
They come in handy sometimes.

(CHICK CONTINUES LAUGHING)

317
00:18:38,448 --> 00:18:40,746
Yes, sir, Rosie,
I've buried them in Abilene

318
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:42,788
and I've buried them
in Santa Fe

319
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:44,708
and I've buried them
in old Mexico,

320
00:18:44,773 --> 00:18:48,540
but I always like
to get back to Bonham
to take care of my friends.

321
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:50,990
Sorry I missed planting
Gus Hanley.

322
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,459
And to think, Rosie,
only three days ago,

323
00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:56,238
I was as close
to Wes Hardin as I am
to you right now.

324
00:18:56,305 --> 00:18:57,797
Chick, you're getting
too sentimental. Now...

325
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,046
Where did you see
Wes Hardin?

326
00:18:59,116 --> 00:19:03,549
Why, four or five days ago,
out on the trail to Abilene.

327
00:19:04,418 --> 00:19:06,171
He's with
the Clements' outfit.

328
00:19:11,574 --> 00:19:13,164
Poor Wes Hardin.

329
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:16,389
I wonder if he's got
a black suit.

330
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:19,038
Then what do you do?

331
00:19:19,113 --> 00:19:21,922
Well, then I give him
a real nice hand.

332
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,000
And then what?

333
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:25,491
Well, then I give myself
a little bit better hand.

334
00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:27,959
Yes, that's how come
I'm riding Rondo.

335
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:30,734
What do you do, son?

336
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,612
I'll open for $200.

337
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,347
Two hundred! Why,
there ain't that much money
in the whole State of Texas.

338
00:19:37,418 --> 00:19:39,553
Yes, there is, Zeke.
Right in my saddle bag.

339
00:19:40,324 --> 00:19:41,337
I'll get it.

340
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:44,122
No, no, no need.
I only got me but $20.

341
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:47,570
You got Rondo.

342
00:19:53,103 --> 00:19:54,693
You've got yourself
a bet, son.

343
00:19:56,616 --> 00:19:58,043
How many cards you want?

344
00:19:58,181 --> 00:19:59,194
Two.

345
00:20:04,123 --> 00:20:06,868
Well, I guess
I'll only need one.

Well, looks like a showdown,
Wes. What you got?

348
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:21,301
Four aces! What...
I never gave you no aces.

349
00:20:21,564 --> 00:20:23,764
Yes, you did, Zeke.
You gave me two on the deal.

to a ringtail baboon!

I'm through playing cards.
My luck's against me.

355
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:39,549
Your luck's all right, Zeke.
You just need
to practice up a little.

356
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,104
Well, I just need
a new deck!

Not yet.

I hear they're due here
this afternoon.

hang out in here?

Well, we're just about
official headquarters
for all the Texas outfits.

in the morning,
it's kind of quiet.

Hey, Charlie.

367

Run over to
Marshall Hickok's office.

368
00:21:29,191 --> 00:21:31,424
Tell him Dirk Hanley
and his brothers
are in town.

369
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:32,918
You tell him yourself.

I ain't messing
with Dirk Hanley
or any of his kin.

First thing we get
into Abilene, I'm gonna
get me a nice cold beer.

Then I'm gonna get me
one of them nice, great,
big 25-cent steaks.

Then I'm gonna jump into

I'm gonna do is

the French dressmaker,

379
00:22:07,748 --> 00:22:11,288
and buy Jane the fanciest
wedding dress ever been seen
in Texas.

Long white veil
and big plumes.

holds out, you can buy
a half-interest in the bank.

over there, John,

to get into a poker game.

a fancy wedding dress.

All satin and lace.
Cost almost $300.

Well, what will I tell him?

I got no quarrel
with Dirk Hanley.

Tell him I'm not coming.

waiting outside if he wants
to come and see me.

that dress has to
be ready in one hour.

it's gonna be

Jane, get into
some decent clothes.

557

Hear me out.

The Yankees are leaving,
more every day.
The curfew has been lifted.

561
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,065
The only charge that will
be brought is the murder
of Gus Hanley.

562
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:46,282
It wasn't murder.

He drew first!

564
00:32:48,941 --> 00:32:51,109
Then you'll get off,
if you have
a fair trial.

565
00:32:52,615 --> 00:32:55,032
I'm going to send

I'll take up the gun

Foster and Pratt down
from Dallas.

572
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:19,632
Of course, my boy,
that's gonna cost
a good deal of money.

573
00:33:20,151 --> 00:33:21,839
More money than you have,
I'm afraid.

574
00:33:22,036 --> 00:33:23,081
How much, Judge?

575
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,638
How much you got?

576
00:33:26,828 --> 00:33:28,319
I got $1,200.

577
00:33:30,054 --> 00:33:33,660
Well, you're at least
$700 or maybe $800 shy.

578
00:33:34,207 --> 00:33:35,830
I'm very sorry,
my boy,

579
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,960
but the scales of justice
hang in a very
delicate balance.

580
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:42,286
There's nothing like money
to tilt it our way.

581
00:33:42,928 --> 00:33:45,574
Now, you be at Sheriff Webb's
office Monday morning.

582
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:48,287
We'll be waiting there
for you. Good day.

583
00:33:49,637 --> 00:33:51,161
There goes our farm, Jane.

584
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:53,940
And he's not even sure
he can get me a fair trial.

585
00:33:54,076 --> 00:33:56,144
You got to raise
more money, Wes,
to make sure.

586
00:33:56,248 --> 00:33:57,490
You got any ideas?

587
00:33:57,557 --> 00:33:59,790
I got one.
I don't know
if it's any good.

588
00:34:00,337 --> 00:34:02,276
That horse of yours,
you said he was fast?

589
00:34:02,861 --> 00:34:05,191
They're holding some races
over in Collin County
this week.

590
00:34:05,257 --> 00:34:09,048

know about Rondo.
If you're lucky...

591
00:34:09,122 --> 00:34:10,647
I don't think
you should go, Wes.

592
00:34:10,975 --> 00:34:14,546
There'll be drinking,
painted women, gambling.

593
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:16,971
And there'll be trouble.

594
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:26,433
Wes.

595
00:34:28,353 --> 00:34:29,334
Please don't go.

596
00:34:29,407 --> 00:34:30,778
I'm not looking
for any trouble, Jane.

597
00:34:31,706 --> 00:34:34,091
The way you wear that gun,
you won't have to look for it.

598
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:35,534
You'd be safer here.

599
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:38,443
All right, I'll go
without my gun.

600
00:34:39,342 --> 00:34:41,672
I'll ask Uncle John
and the boys to come along.

601
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,745
There won't be
any trouble.

602
00:34:44,965 --> 00:34:46,620
I'm sorry to keep
picking on you.

603
00:34:47,233 --> 00:34:49,051
I know you've had to
give up all your money,

604
00:34:49,308 --> 00:34:50,767
all your plans, because of me.

605
00:34:50,937 --> 00:34:52,145
We need that money, Jane.

606
00:34:53,493 --> 00:34:56,586
And when I get back, Sunday,
I want you to be wearing
that wedding dress.

607
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:12,462

00:35:19,337 --> 00:35:21,057
All right, line
those horses up here, boys.

612
00:35:21,126 --> 00:35:23,489
Get in line,
a straight line.
MAN 2: Yes, sir.

613
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,590
Turn them around,
get in a straight line.

614
00:35:25,725 --> 00:35:28,022
We're not gonna start this race
until all of them are
in a straight line.

615
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,943
Get those horses in a line.
I won't start this race till
the horses... Clem, get back!

616
00:35:32,019 --> 00:35:33,391
Get set, go!

00:36:04,569 --> 00:36:06,094
Come on, Wes! Wes!

620
00:36:09,937 --> 00:36:11,015
Wes!

(LAUGHING)

622
00:36:12,141 --> 00:36:14,787
Judge, how much
is in the pot
for the winner?

623
00:36:14,856 --> 00:36:15,902
How much, Charlie?

624
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:19,351
Let's see.
That's $385.

625
00:36:20,638 --> 00:36:23,219
Aw, and to think
I had to lose that horse
in a crooked deal.

626
00:36:27,825 --> 00:36:30,091
Don't forget, folks,
all bets will
be paid off

627
00:36:30,158 --> 00:36:32,358
at Jack Martin's saloon
after the last race.

628
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:37,088
Hey, you! I'll bet you $500
against the $385 you can't
outrun my buckskin.

629
00:36:37,984 --> 00:36:39,094
You got yourself a bet.

630
00:36:39,389 --> 00:36:40,336
So have you.

631
00:36:40,412 --> 00:36:42,677
Gyp, cool him out.

632
00:36:44,341 --> 00:36:47,881
Hey, Wes, $385
is a lot of money.
You better be...

633
00:36:47,951 --> 00:36:49,290
Put up your money, mister.

634
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,791
Easy come, easy go.

635
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:56,670
Wes, have a drink
on the hearse?

636
00:36:56,735 --> 00:36:57,682
Thanks, Chick.

637
00:37:00,026 --> 00:37:01,071
Hey, Wes.

638
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,278
Well, Rosie.

639
00:37:04,531 --> 00:37:05,903
You come up here
by yourself?

640
00:37:05,968 --> 00:37:08,865
No. No, quite a few of us
came up from Bonham today.
Oh, yeah?

641
00:37:08,939 --> 00:37:10,877
Including Ike Hanley
and Sheriff Webb.

642
00:37:11,591 --> 00:37:13,311
That's why Chick Noonan
brought along his hearse.

643
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:15,316
Aw, Sheriff Webb's got
no cause to make trouble.

644
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:18,136
But Ike Hanley has,
and you're walking around
without a gun.

645
00:37:18,746 --> 00:37:22,285
Ah, you're wrong, Rosie.
I'm going back to Bonham
and give myself up,

646
00:37:22,419 --> 00:37:24,303
after I get married
to Jane on Sunday.

647
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,615
Yes, you're gonna buy a farm
and settle down
and raise horses, huh?

648
00:37:29,096 --> 00:37:32,255
That's right, but there'll
always be a place
at the table for you.

649
00:37:32,545 --> 00:37:36,281
You'll make a fine farmer.
And you'll make Jane
very happy,

650
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,509
wondering every day
when you're gonna
get killed.

651
00:37:38,871 --> 00:37:39,851
Don't worry about it.

652
00:37:40,788 --> 00:37:42,857
I don't know why
I should care about you.

653
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:44,866
Why do you?

654
00:37:46,314 --> 00:37:48,699
Maybe it's because
you and me are both
the same kind.

655
00:37:49,029 --> 00:37:52,318
Living high on the hog today
because we don't believe
tomorrow's gonna come.

656
00:37:54,204 --> 00:37:56,306
All right, Preacher's Boy,
have it your way.

657
00:37:57,846 --> 00:37:59,120
Goodbye, Rosie.

658
00:38:05,065 --> 00:38:06,012
Wes.

659
00:38:07,526 --> 00:38:08,506
Yeah?

660
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:09,946
Take care of yourself.

661
00:38:10,974 --> 00:38:12,020
I aim to, Rosie.

662
00:38:17,427 --> 00:38:18,374
Who's that peacock?

663
00:38:18,737 --> 00:38:20,556
That's Rosie McCoy,
a friend of mine.

664
00:38:20,622 --> 00:38:21,603
Where's she from?

665
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:25,030
Bonham. She works
for the Hanleys.

666
00:38:25,797 --> 00:38:27,354
You say she's
a friend of yours?

667
00:38:27,522 --> 00:38:29,754
The best friend I have,
excepting you.

668
00:38:32,538 --> 00:38:34,226
Hey, what's going on
there, mister?

669
00:38:34,295 --> 00:38:35,340
Just shedding
a little weight.

670
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:38,125
Well, then, I guess we'll
shed a little weight, too.
Take her off, Gyp.

671
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,197
Hey, mister, if you're
gonna ride bareback,

672
00:38:40,268 --> 00:38:41,858
you better put some glue on
the seat of your britches.

673
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,130
I'll be all right.
You better get some for him.

674
00:38:44,421 --> 00:38:46,457
He can ride frontward,
backward, sideways,

675
00:38:46,529 --> 00:38:48,282
standing up
and without a bridle.

676
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,776
What's going on here?

677
00:38:49,851 --> 00:38:51,409
This feller fancies
himself a rider.

678
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,778
Yeah, wants to ride
without a saddle.

679
00:38:53,844 --> 00:38:55,303
Oh.
It's all right by me.

680
00:38:55,378 --> 00:38:57,099
Fancy feller, huh?
Yeah.

681
00:38:58,093 --> 00:38:59,040
Okay.

682
00:39:01,288 --> 00:39:02,235
Yeah.

683
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:04,704
Here. Here's a hundred
and a quarter.
How much money you got?

684
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,261
Hundred and a quarter.
On Rondo.

let's get them up
to the starting line.

00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:10,769
Get them
even, boys.

687
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:14,288
I want them even.

We'll get it, anyway.

I tell you I can't
go through with it, Ike.

I've known that boy
all his life.

What you mean is
you're scared.

704
00:40:20,734 --> 00:40:23,218
Why not?
He's the fastest draw
in Texas.

705
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,694
But he ain't looking
for trouble from you.

Now just handle it
the way I told you.

Yeah.

708
00:40:27,857 --> 00:40:29,796
Suppose he doesn't try
to resist arrest?

Here's $500
that says he does.

wearing a gun.

You're under arrest
for killing Gus Hanley.

You're a bit out of
your territory,
ain't you, Charlie?

00:41:53,693 --> 00:41:55,893
It's legal.
I'm making a lawful arrest.

John, you keep out of this.

Keep your hands
where I can see them.

There's no sense in
your arresting me today,
Charlie.

You must've talked
to Judge Ames.
Ike knows about it.

Never mind the talk.

for any trouble here,

I'm not turning myself in
till Monday, like I agreed.

And I'm keeping my word.

you're going?

I'm going back to Bonham,
like I said.

That's the first place
they'll look for you.

I'm going home
to get Jane.

746

Aw, Wes, why don't you
stop talking like a fool?

747
00:42:52,471 --> 00:42:53,843
You ain't going back
to get nobody.

748
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:56,326
You're heading right for
the Rio Grande, right now.
Ain't that so, John?

749
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,372
Well, if he says he's
going back for Jane,
he's going back.

750
00:42:58,445 --> 00:43:00,328
And I'm going with him
to see that he gets there.

751

It's only a short piece,
Uncle John.
I can make it myself.

752
00:43:03,108 --> 00:43:05,079
Boys, go on back
to the ranch.

753
00:43:06,176 --> 00:43:08,789
And if a posse comes along,
keep them talking
as long as you can

754
00:43:08,922 --> 00:43:11,667
and then send them
on the wrong road.
You understand?

Wes, you're hurt!
I'm all right.

What happened?
Charlie Webb tried
to shoot me down.

757
00:43:36,107 --> 00:43:37,185
Ike Hanley put him
up to it.

758
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,643
I told him I'd turn myself
in after the wedding
like I promised,

759
00:43:40,803 --> 00:43:41,750
but he wouldn't listen.

760
00:43:41,857 --> 00:43:42,870
So you killed him?

761
00:43:42,944 --> 00:43:45,808
Yes, I killed him
and Ike Hanley, too.

posse of them
after me right now.

765
00:43:54,379 --> 00:43:57,505
But don't start
praying for my
eternal soul, not yet.

766
00:43:57,989 --> 00:44:00,603
I'm getting out of here,
clear out of Texas,

767
00:44:00,673 --> 00:44:01,686
Jane and me.

768
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,830
We'll get that farm, Jane,
just like I promised you.
Then we'II...

769
00:44:06,903 --> 00:44:09,451
Sure, I know, the place
with the white painted fence,
the green grass

770
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:10,949
and the water
all year round.

771
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,842
I don't believe that
anymore, Wes.

772
00:44:12,908 --> 00:44:14,596
I don't think
you believe it.

773
00:44:14,664 --> 00:44:17,475
No. You'll never have
that place. Not now.

774
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,903
You'll never have more than
six feet of ground.
Jane, listen.

775
00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:21,306
Because you'll never
stop killing.

776
00:44:21,373 --> 00:44:23,377
I never killed a man
except in self-defense.

777
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,004
Why did you kill
Gus Hanley?

778
00:44:25,111 --> 00:44:27,692
I told you! He tried
to kill me first!
And Dirk Hanley?

779
00:44:27,858 --> 00:44:29,165
He came looking for me.

780
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,144
Jane, we haven't got time.

781
00:44:31,212 --> 00:44:33,151
Uncle John's waiting
on the other side
of the crick.

782
00:44:33,224 --> 00:44:37,211
What are you trying to prove?
That you're above the laws
of man and God?

783
00:44:38,399 --> 00:44:41,264
Not God, not his laws.

784
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:43,570
Your laws, your whip.

785
00:44:44,533 --> 00:44:46,319
But you never
made me crawl.

786
00:44:46,386 --> 00:44:48,520
I was never afraid
of you or any man.

787
00:44:48,589 --> 00:44:50,822
No, you're not afraid
of anyone so long
as you have a gun,

788
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:52,033
so long as you can kill!

789
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:53,474
You talk like him.

790
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:55,545
If you'd come away
with me when I wanted,
if he hadn't interfered,

791
00:44:55,618 --> 00:44:56,859
there wouldn't have been
any more killing.

792
00:44:56,927 --> 00:45:01,230
There'll always be more, Wes,
because you'll always have
to prove you're not afraid.

793
00:45:01,304 --> 00:45:02,676
You'll always have
to kill to prove it.

794
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:03,950
Ah, you're talking crazy.

795
00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:05,675
How do you feel
when you kill?

796
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:08,357
Do you feel bad
or do you feel good?

797
00:45:08,554 --> 00:45:11,484
Do you feel good, Wes?
Tell me. Tell me!

798
00:45:16,158 --> 00:45:17,618
I stayed too long.

799
00:45:18,203 --> 00:45:19,542
JENKINS: Wes Hardin.

800
00:45:20,088 --> 00:45:21,395
Don't open that door.

801
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:25,605
What would you do?
Shoot me down, too?

802
00:45:27,178 --> 00:45:28,257
Who is it?

803
00:45:28,328 --> 00:45:30,235
Bud Jenkins.
I'm the Marshall.

804
00:45:31,076 --> 00:45:34,332
Sheriff Webb's been killed.
We've got a posse
around the place.

805
00:45:34,781 --> 00:45:36,785
We want Wes Hardin to come out
or we're coming in after him.

806
00:45:37,497 --> 00:45:39,403
Get away
from the door.

807
00:45:42,928 --> 00:45:44,485
Don't, Wes. Don't.

808
00:45:51,713 --> 00:45:53,880
Put up your hands,
Hardin, and come toward us.

809
00:45:54,204 --> 00:45:55,543
I'm staying right here.

810
00:45:56,409 --> 00:45:59,088
I killed Ike Hanley
and Charlie Webb
in self-defense

811
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:00,169
and you all know it.

812
00:46:00,721 --> 00:46:03,465
You killed
an officer of the law during
the performance of his duty.

813
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:05,218
You killed him
while resisting arrest.

814
00:46:09,506 --> 00:46:10,452
What are you gonna do, Wes?

815
00:46:10,528 --> 00:46:12,380
If they catch me,
they'll string me up
without a prayer.

816
00:46:12,445 --> 00:46:13,425
I'll try to make
the crick.

817
00:46:13,499 --> 00:46:15,252
I'll cover for you.

818
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:19,399
Go on upstairs, Joe.
I'll try and make it
through the back door.

819
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,747
Pa! Pa!

820
00:47:57,031 --> 00:47:57,978
(HOOTING)

821
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,470
(HOOTING)

822
00:48:12,044 --> 00:48:13,536
(HOOTING)

823
00:48:18,339 --> 00:48:19,863
I heard the shots, Wes.

824
00:48:19,936 --> 00:48:24,151
Sure looks like
you stopped some of them.
Let's get over here.

825
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:32,261
If I tied you on the saddle,
you'd bleed to death
before we went a mile.

826
00:48:35,237 --> 00:48:37,306
Over here. That's it.

827
00:48:37,537 --> 00:48:38,484
(GRUNTS)

828
00:48:39,901 --> 00:48:41,840
Get down there. There.

829
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:52,572
Here's his horse.

830
00:49:04,977 --> 00:49:08,833
I'll be right back
as soon as I can, Wes.
You'll be all right, boy.

831
00:49:12,612 --> 00:49:16,381
Tell Jane I'm all right.

832
00:49:29,191 --> 00:49:32,568
He's not around here.
He must've taken to the hills.

833
00:50:47,328 --> 00:50:48,275
(GROANS)

834
00:51:10,295 --> 00:51:12,658
Hang on, Wes,
this is gonna bite.

835
00:51:26,588 --> 00:51:27,535
Where are we?

836
00:51:27,898 --> 00:51:29,933
We're in the Territory
heading for Kansas.

837
00:51:31,123 --> 00:51:32,070
No.

838
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,204
No, we're going to Bonham.

839
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:39,195
I told Jane
I was coming back for her.

840
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:40,958
You can't go back
to Bonham, Wes.

841
00:51:42,816 --> 00:51:44,668
I told you I was
going back to get her.

842
00:51:44,733 --> 00:51:46,389
No, Wes, no.
There's no need
for you to go back.

843
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:49,098
Jane's dead.

844
00:51:53,453 --> 00:51:54,858
They killed her.

845
00:51:57,254 --> 00:52:01,110
They couldn't get me
so they killed her.

846
00:52:01,185 --> 00:52:03,602
Yeah, and if you go back,
they'll get you.

847
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,057
(THUNDER ROLLING)

848
00:53:00,824 --> 00:53:02,229
Morning, gentlemen.
Good morning, Captain.

849
00:53:02,294 --> 00:53:03,720
Sorry to keep you waiting.

850
00:53:03,795 --> 00:53:05,831
Captain, our readers
want to know how,
in actual practice,

851
00:53:05,903 --> 00:53:07,809
the Rangers can succeed
in enforcing the law

852
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,790
where the present
sheriffs and marshals fail.

853
00:53:09,865 --> 00:53:11,270
Well, in a practical sense,

854
00:53:11,335 --> 00:53:15,550
the importance of a police
agency like the Rangers
can best be illustrated

855
00:53:15,615 --> 00:53:16,857
by this man Wes Hardin.

856
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:20,881
This notorious killer
has escaped apprehension
for six years

857
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:23,215
simply by hopping
from county to county.

858
00:53:23,473 --> 00:53:26,729
But with the Rangers,
they can pursue him anywhere
on a statewide basis

859
00:53:27,051 --> 00:53:29,120
and, with a little help
from the Governor's Office,

860
00:53:29,192 --> 00:53:32,830
can go beyond the boundaries
of Texas and bring this man
to justice.

861
00:53:33,504 --> 00:53:34,615
Yes, Duncan?

862
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:45,163
Gentlemen, you can tell
your readers we'll bring in
Wes Hardin.

863
00:53:45,228 --> 00:53:47,232
(CHUCKLES)
Sure, Captain, but when?

864
00:53:47,304 --> 00:53:49,756
When? They'll read about it
in the papers.

865
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:56,812
Rosie?

866
00:53:58,453 --> 00:53:59,400
Rosie.

867
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:09,053
What is it?
Where's my boot?
I can't find my boot.

868
00:54:12,348 --> 00:54:13,328
Here it is.

869
00:54:13,402 --> 00:54:15,123
Maybe you better hang it on
your watch chain.

870
00:54:15,192 --> 00:54:16,564
Yeah. Guess I'll have to.

871
00:54:17,715 --> 00:54:20,100
Going out to look
for a card game?
Mmm-hmm.

872
00:54:20,175 --> 00:54:22,375
Saloon on the corner
seems lively enough.

873
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:23,971
Where's my money?

874
00:54:31,132 --> 00:54:33,136
Pretty thin bankroll.
Yeah.

875
00:54:33,911 --> 00:54:35,915
Well, it won't always
be like this, honey.

876
00:54:36,498 --> 00:54:38,600
Running all the time,
living with riffraff.

877
00:54:38,671 --> 00:54:40,555
Rich in the morning,
poor at night.

878
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,788
Someday were gonna
have that farm.
Sure, Wes, the farm.

879
00:54:43,399 --> 00:54:45,152
With green grass
and white painted house

880
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:46,940
and water that runs
all year round.

881
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:50,930
You wouldn't take
that farm if somebody
put it in your lap

882
00:54:51,097 --> 00:54:52,273
tied up in ribbons.

883
00:54:52,439 --> 00:54:53,549
Why wouldn't I?

884
00:54:54,132 --> 00:54:56,811
How many times have you
had enough to buy a farm
twice over?

885
00:54:57,135 --> 00:54:59,683
We had $3,000 in Waco.

886
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:02,139
And there was
a time in Houston
when you were 8,000 ahead.

887
00:55:02,406 --> 00:55:04,094
But did you ever even
look at a farm, Wes?

888
00:55:04,163 --> 00:55:05,176
What are you trying to say?

889
00:55:08,027 --> 00:55:10,544
I'm trying to say
I don't like
your fancy dream.

890
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:14,510
You hang on to it because
it makes you feel better than
the gamblers, the riffraff.

891
00:55:15,535 --> 00:55:17,190
Maybe even better than me.

892
00:55:17,931 --> 00:55:19,358
And I don't want you
to feel better than me, Wes,

893
00:55:20,231 --> 00:55:22,943
'cause I love you
the way you are,
the way you really are.

894
00:55:23,809 --> 00:55:25,909
One of these days,
I'm gonna surprise you, Rosie.

895
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:29,174
I'm gonna win me
a wagonload of money.
Then we'll settle down.

896
00:55:29,686 --> 00:55:31,723
Might even do it tonight.
Feeling lucky.

897
00:55:32,273 --> 00:55:34,212
Good. You might win enough
to pay for dinner.

898
00:55:34,797 --> 00:55:35,875
And if I don't?

899
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:39,899
We'll eat anyway.

900
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:42,782
Grandma, what would
I do without you?

901
00:55:44,221 --> 00:55:45,168
(SCREAMS)

902
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:47,660
Oh! Why, you pig.

903
00:55:47,735 --> 00:55:48,682
I'll be back for supper.

904
00:55:56,456 --> 00:55:57,981
When did
Mr. Swain check in?

905
00:55:58,053 --> 00:55:59,262
Last night.
Thank you.

906
00:56:04,154 --> 00:56:05,362
Who was the nosy Parker?

907
00:56:05,432 --> 00:56:07,795
From the sound of him,
I'd say he came from Texas.

908
00:56:08,083 --> 00:56:09,096
What did he want to know?

909
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:11,022
All about you
and your brother.

910
00:56:12,045 --> 00:56:13,701
He's probably
a business friend
of my brother's.

911
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:16,548
Then your brother
must be doing business
with the Texas Rangers.

912
00:56:16,613 --> 00:56:18,432
I saw a star
under his coat.

913
00:56:25,717 --> 00:56:28,048
Raise 200.
I'll call.

914
00:56:28,113 --> 00:56:30,825
Wes. Oh, Wes,
a man just stole
my diamond ring.

915
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,381
He's still at the hotel.
Hurry, before he gets away.

916
00:56:34,247 --> 00:56:35,194
Sorry, gentlemen.

917
00:56:35,717 --> 00:56:38,939
I hate to leave
in the middle of a game,
especially when I'm ahead.

918
00:56:39,454 --> 00:56:42,166
Oh, wait a minute,
I've got three kings.

919
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,920
I'm sorry, three aces.

920
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:47,246
Wes, Wes, never mind
the money. My ring. My ring.

921
00:56:47,887 --> 00:56:49,226
I'll be back, gentlemen.

922
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:57,746
What is it?

923
00:56:57,821 --> 00:56:59,379
Wes, the Rangers,
they're here!

924
00:56:59,451 --> 00:57:00,855
What would the Rangers
be doing in Kansas?

925
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,371
I don't know, but there's
one of them at the hotel
looking for you.

926
00:57:07,661 --> 00:57:10,307
Get out of here, Rosie.
There's gonna be
some shooting.

927
00:57:10,631 --> 00:57:11,612
No, Wes, no.

928
00:57:11,687 --> 00:57:13,091
Go back to the hotel.

929
00:58:46,529 --> 00:58:47,803
What is it, Rosie?

930
00:58:49,181 --> 00:58:51,860
All the time we've been here
and you won't even bother
to unpack.

931
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:53,967
Or hang up the curtains.

932
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,183
Complaining about
your housekeeper again?

933
00:58:58,253 --> 00:58:59,200
Yes.

934
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:02,882
Listen, Wes,
I was born on a farm.

935
00:59:03,811 --> 00:59:05,880
My father marched away
from a farm,

936
00:59:05,951 --> 00:59:07,890
tall and brave in
a fine new uniform.

937
00:59:08,699 --> 00:59:09,646
I never saw him again.

938
00:59:10,967 --> 00:59:14,028
My mother died on a farm,
giving birth to his son.

939
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,740
I saw plenty of farms
after that, too.

940
00:59:16,813 --> 00:59:18,850
People sweating and digging
their lives away.

941
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:22,909
I saw them slaving so they
could save up a few pennies
for that rainy day.

942
00:59:23,488 --> 00:59:26,037
It never rains, Wes,
it pours.

943
00:59:26,205 --> 00:59:27,729
It doesn't have
to be that way.

944
00:59:28,089 --> 00:59:29,363
Well, that's
how it is.

945
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:33,449
If the weather doesn't get
you, the grasshoppers do,
the taxes or the mortgage.

946
00:59:33,935 --> 00:59:36,386
Or the State of Alabama
starts a war with
the State of Georgia,

947
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:39,299
and you get killed
by some fool bullet
meant for a general.

948
00:59:39,524 --> 00:59:42,618
So you never hope
and you never plan because
someday you might get hurt?

949
00:59:42,815 --> 00:59:43,926
If that's the way
you want to say it.

950
00:59:43,998 --> 00:59:45,522
Well, I know a card game, too.

951
00:59:46,426 --> 00:59:48,724
I know that
if you want to win,
you've got to take a chance.

952
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:50,129
You gotta add something
to the pot.

953
00:59:50,195 --> 00:59:52,874
Yeah, but you can't win,
Wes, if you're holding
my kind of cards.

954
00:59:52,942 --> 00:59:53,922
How do you mean?

955
00:59:53,997 --> 00:59:55,456
I mean you, Wes.

956
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:58,306
Now you have to sweat
from sunup to sundown
every day for a year

957
00:59:58,372 --> 01:00:00,921
to earn $1,000,
if you're lucky.

958
01:00:00,992 --> 01:00:02,876
You used to be
the kind of man who would
sit in a card game

959
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,847
and win that much money
in one night.

960
01:00:06,423 --> 01:00:07,795
Haven't you been
thinking about that, Wes?

961
01:00:07,861 --> 01:00:10,823
Sure, I've thought
all about that,
but this farm is what I want.

962
01:00:10,896 --> 01:00:13,412
Yeah, yeah,
you want it now.
It's new, it's a toy.

963
01:00:13,483 --> 01:00:16,063
And when you get tired of it,
you're gonna wander into town,
pick up a hand,

964
01:00:16,134 --> 01:00:17,658
and have to shoot your way
out of town again.

965
01:00:17,795 --> 01:00:19,734
A man can change, can't he?

966
01:00:20,926 --> 01:00:22,865
Prove it to me, Wes.
Prove it.

967
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:28,138
Because you got no right
to ask me to change

968
01:00:28,624 --> 01:00:29,899
until you can prove it.

969
01:00:40,188 --> 01:00:41,135
Rosie!

970
01:00:43,575 --> 01:00:45,742
Rosie! Come here, quick.

971
01:00:50,411 --> 01:00:52,098
What is it?

972
01:00:52,167 --> 01:00:53,114
Wes.

973
01:00:54,882 --> 01:00:55,829
What is it?

974
01:00:58,045 --> 01:00:58,992
(GASPS)

975
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:12,991
Come in, Parson.
Come in. Come in.

976
01:01:17,564 --> 01:01:18,936
PARSON: Is this the bride?

977
01:01:23,026 --> 01:01:24,169
WES: It sure is.

978
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,463
My, what a pretty dress.
And such a lovely bride!

979
01:01:40,373 --> 01:01:44,522
"Dearly beloved, we are
gathered together here
in the sight of God..."

980
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,094
No trace of Hardin since
you let him get away
from you in Kansas City?

981
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:49,658
No, sir,
and I don't think
he's in Texas.

982
01:01:49,731 --> 01:01:50,678
Why?

983
01:01:50,754 --> 01:01:52,660
Well, these recent killings
don't fit his pattern.

984
01:01:52,734 --> 01:01:54,999
He's never been
a thief or a bandit
or a bully.

985
01:01:55,386 --> 01:01:58,131
I think the local officers
just charge every unsolved
shooting to Hardin.

986
01:01:58,644 --> 01:02:00,681
He's a killer all right,
but he's brave and...

987
01:02:00,752 --> 01:02:04,868
John Wesley Hardin has made
the name of Texas stink
in the nostrils of justice,

988
01:02:05,225 --> 01:02:08,067
and I want him brought in
here no matter where he is.

989
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:09,238
Yes, sir.

990
01:02:09,474 --> 01:02:11,259
His brother and uncle
still live up near Bonham,
don't they?

991
01:02:11,326 --> 01:02:12,273
Yes, sir.

992
01:02:12,349 --> 01:02:14,963
Well, he's bound to get
in touch with them or drop in
on them sooner or later.

993
01:02:15,032 --> 01:02:18,092
Yes, sir. We have a man
staked out, checking every
move and watching the mail.

994
01:02:18,258 --> 01:02:19,717
I'd like to take a run
down there myself, sir.

995
01:02:20,048 --> 01:02:23,205
Good. Don't get
too fond of him, Duncan.

996
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:24,707
If you want
to sing his praises,

997
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:27,323
we'll give you a chance
to recite a eulogy
over his grave

998
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:28,765
after we hang him.

999
01:02:29,215 --> 01:02:30,391
Yes, sir.
That's all.

1000
01:02:31,004 --> 01:02:32,595
Yes, sir.
We'll bring him in, sir.

1001
01:02:33,081 --> 01:02:35,793
All right, bring him in alive,
if you can.

1002
01:02:37,776 --> 01:02:38,952
(CHICKENS CLUCKING)

1003
01:02:42,664 --> 01:02:45,049
Hi, honey.
I'm hungrier than a bear.

1004
01:02:45,124 --> 01:02:46,975
Well, you ought to be.
Your food's been
waiting an hour.

1005
01:02:47,105 --> 01:02:48,509
Now it's all cold.

1006
01:02:48,573 --> 01:02:49,554
Well, I'm sorry.

1007
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:51,955
The buckskin mare's
been having a little trouble.

1008
01:02:52,024 --> 01:02:54,703
And your corn pudding's
all burned.

1009
01:02:54,772 --> 01:02:57,636
I always promised myself
I'd never try to
tie you down,

1010
01:02:57,806 --> 01:02:59,809
tell you when to come
and when to go.

1011
01:02:59,881 --> 01:03:01,667
I act like
a nagging old wife!

1012
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:04,793
Well, now, what's the matter?

1013
01:03:04,993 --> 01:03:06,899
The corn pudding's
not that important.

1014
01:03:07,357 --> 01:03:08,762
The mare's about
to have her foal.

1015
01:03:10,296 --> 01:03:13,009
Well, horses aren't
the only thing born
on a farm, Wes Hardin.

1016
01:03:16,558 --> 01:03:17,799
Rosie!

1017
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:20,929
You mean you? Us?

1018
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:23,615
If it'd been a mare,
you'd have known
weeks ago.

1019
01:03:26,332 --> 01:03:27,857
Wes! Wes!

1020
01:03:28,217 --> 01:03:29,872
Wes! Wes.

1021
01:03:54,922 --> 01:03:58,179
"...and we expect the baby
around the end of October.

1022
01:03:58,245 --> 01:04:02,013
"I am sure it will be a boy
and I'm going to name him
after you."

Since when is
the Good Lord letting on

1025
01:04:06,806 --> 01:04:09,104
whether it's boys
or girls coming into
this world?

farm here

and Joe could come for
a visit sometime soon."

1028
01:04:17,156 --> 01:04:18,844
Maybe we could, Pa.

1029
01:04:19,775 --> 01:04:22,193
Maybe next winter
after the boy is born.

1030
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:27,982
I'll be back
day after tomorrow, Rosie.

1031
01:04:28,657 --> 01:04:30,475
Will you be all right?
Sure, Wes.

1032
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:35,577
Oh, Wes...

1033
01:04:35,651 --> 01:04:37,471
Aw, there won't be
any trouble, Rosie.

1034
01:04:38,112 --> 01:04:39,452
I've been to
horse auctions before.

1035
01:04:39,518 --> 01:04:41,903
No. No, no,
it's not that, Wes.

1036
01:04:42,616 --> 01:04:45,426
It's something I've been
wanting to say to you
for a long time.

1037
01:04:47,152 --> 01:04:49,700
You remember
when I was being stubborn,

1038
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:51,905
when I said I didn't think
you could ever change any?

1039
01:04:52,167 --> 01:04:53,114
Yeah?

1040
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:55,038
Well, I was wrong.

1041
01:04:55,202 --> 01:04:57,620
I know what's
happened to me.

1042
01:04:57,693 --> 01:05:00,471
Nothing's gonna
change me back to the way
I was, Wes, nothing.

1043
01:05:02,454 --> 01:05:04,871
I guess all a person needs
is half a chance.

1044
01:05:05,745 --> 01:05:08,706
I feel safe here, Wes,
and settled.

1045
01:05:09,257 --> 01:05:12,155
And I don't care if I never
see to the other side
of the next mountain

because this is
where I want to be,

Sure, honey.

I always heard women
get nervous and fidgety
around this time.

1049
01:05:21,621 --> 01:05:24,234
They get their heads
full of queer ideas.

1050

Well, you go
right on talking.

He took the day off
for himself. I'm filling in
for him, Wes.

Put your hands up, Hardin.
You're under arrest.

01:06:56,527 --> 01:06:58,051
Get his gun?
He hasn't got one.

1067
01:06:58,572 --> 01:07:00,424
All right, take him along.

1068
01:07:17,419 --> 01:07:18,943
John Wesley Hardin,

1069
01:07:19,273 --> 01:07:23,357
the jury having found you
guilty of the murder
of Sheriff Charles Webb,

1070
01:07:23,553 --> 01:07:26,451
it now becomes my duty
to pronounce sentence.

1071
01:07:26,524 --> 01:07:29,999
Frankly, there's no doubt
in my mind as to what
punishment you deserve,

1072
01:07:31,252 --> 01:07:35,303
but this court, jealously
guarding the traditions
of American justice,

1073
01:07:35,787 --> 01:07:39,937
refuses to sentence you in
accordance with the demands
of popular opinion.

1074
01:07:40,962 --> 01:07:43,380
And, again, we refuse
to sentence you
for other crimes

1075
01:07:43,455 --> 01:07:45,872
which you are alleged
to have committed,

1076
01:07:46,202 --> 01:07:47,793
but for which you
have not been tried.

1077
01:07:50,002 --> 01:07:53,031
In the matter of the murder
of Sheriff Webb,

1078
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:56,195
the prosecution has failed
to bring forth any witnesses

1079
01:07:56,392 --> 01:07:59,551
who saw the actual
commission of this
particular crime.

1080
01:07:59,938 --> 01:08:02,355
Some of the alleged
witnesses are dead.

1081
01:08:02,430 --> 01:08:04,314
Others have failed
to come forward.

1082
01:08:05,912 --> 01:08:08,492
Therefore, it is the sentence
of this court,

1083
01:08:09,616 --> 01:08:12,514
that you be confined
at hard labor

1084
01:08:13,099 --> 01:08:16,225
for a period of 25 years
in the State Prison
at Huntsville.

1085
01:08:16,294 --> 01:08:17,633
WOMAN: Twenty-five years
in the State Prison!

1086
01:08:17,699 --> 01:08:18,941
(PEOPLE MURMURING)

1087
01:08:19,073 --> 01:08:20,859
(JUDGE BANGING GAVEL)

1088
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:27,151
Has the prisoner
anything to say?

1089
01:08:30,604 --> 01:08:32,031
Yes, I have, Your Honor.

1090
01:08:34,215 --> 01:08:37,471
If you and the jury
weren't afraid of
public opinion,

1091
01:08:38,878 --> 01:08:40,915
I never would have
been convicted

1092
01:08:41,818 --> 01:08:45,128
because I shot Charlie Webb
in self-defense
and you all know it.

1093
01:08:47,152 --> 01:08:48,611
Maybe I did wrong,

1094
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:51,045
maybe I deserve
to be punished,

1095
01:08:52,327 --> 01:08:53,602
but I'm not a murderer.

1096
01:08:54,979 --> 01:08:57,527
I never killed a man
who didn't try
to kill me first.

1097
01:08:59,099 --> 01:09:00,275
Take him away.

1098
01:09:13,347 --> 01:09:16,309
Keep the place, Rosie,
no matter what.

1099
01:09:16,542 --> 01:09:18,262
I will, Wes.
I promise.

1100
01:09:21,109 --> 01:09:22,667
The little fellow, Rosie,

1101
01:09:23,697 --> 01:09:25,255
tell him.
Tell him I never...

1102
01:09:25,325 --> 01:09:27,656
I will, Wes.
I will.

1103
01:09:27,722 --> 01:09:30,717

1116
01:10:29,056 --> 01:10:30,363
What's keeping you?

1117
01:10:31,451 --> 01:10:34,544
I was reading a story,
Amy, a true story.

1118
01:10:35,092 --> 01:10:36,432
What kind of a story is it?

1119
01:10:37,393 --> 01:10:38,917
I don't know yet, Amy,

1120
01:10:39,246 --> 01:10:42,208
because I don't rightly
know how this story
is going to end.

1121
01:11:41,666 --> 01:11:42,612
Wes!

1122
01:11:43,775 --> 01:11:44,722

01:11:47,671 --> 01:11:48,617
Wes!

1125
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:00,791
Why didn't you tell us
you were coming?

1126
01:12:02,335 --> 01:12:03,925
I wanted to come home
this way, Rosie.

1127
01:12:06,295 --> 01:12:10,216
Kind of like I was just
coming back from that
horse auction at Pensacola,

1128
01:12:11,087 --> 01:12:12,611
a long time ago.

1129
01:12:15,943 --> 01:12:17,347
The place looks fine, Rosie.

1130
01:12:19,521 --> 01:12:20,893
You're looking so pretty.

1131
01:12:22,076 --> 01:12:23,186
Prettier than I remembered.

1132
01:12:27,091 --> 01:12:28,746
Dreamt of you, Rosie,

1133
01:12:29,582 --> 01:12:32,066
every night and every day
for all these years.

1134
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,873
I dreamed of you
for so hard that

1135
01:12:36,323 --> 01:12:38,905
I couldn't rightly
remember what you
looked like anymore.

1136
01:12:40,029 --> 01:12:42,326
I nearly went crazy
trying to draw a picture
of you in my mind.

1137
01:12:42,392 --> 01:12:45,735
I know, Wes. I know.
A woman dreams, too.

1138
01:12:55,522 --> 01:12:59,409
We tried to keep
the place together, Wes.
We got some good horses.

1139
01:13:02,741 --> 01:13:07,305
We whitewashed the stables
every spring and we tried
to get the house painted.

1140
01:13:13,506 --> 01:13:14,846
Is that him?

1141
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:18,033
Yes.

1142
01:13:20,438 --> 01:13:22,093
What sort of a boy
is he, Rosie?

1143
01:13:23,409 --> 01:13:27,232
John's almost a man now.
He's worked like one
since he was 12.

1144
01:13:29,735 --> 01:13:32,480
He's been waiting
a long time for this day.

1145
01:13:34,367 --> 01:13:35,770
We both have.

1146
01:13:58,485 --> 01:13:59,791
Hello, Son.

1147
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:03,105
You must be...

1148
01:14:03,659 --> 01:14:04,606
Yep.

1149
01:14:06,279 --> 01:14:10,582
Your ma said you were
grown-up, but I didn't
expect to see a man.

1150
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:14,454
Ma says if I keep on growing,
I'll be as tall as you.

1151
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:18,121
You're strong, too.

1152
01:14:18,993 --> 01:14:20,550
You've worked hard,
haven't you, Son?

1153
01:14:21,389 --> 01:14:23,110
I don't mind working.

1154
01:14:23,945 --> 01:14:28,759
Well, now that there's two
of us, maybe you'll have time
for some fun once in a while.

1155
01:14:32,505 --> 01:14:35,467
Nice pony. Is he yours?

1156
01:14:35,636 --> 01:14:37,520
I guess he's
rightly yours, now.

1157
01:14:38,288 --> 01:14:39,660
Well, you worked
the place, Son.

1158
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:43,423
I figure everything here
belongs as much to you
as to...

1159
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:46,938
You ought to
remember this, Pa.
It's yours.

1160
01:14:47,648 --> 01:14:51,731
Sometimes people come
out here asking to see it.
I keep it loaded, too.

1161
01:14:54,036 --> 01:14:55,942
Is this how you
used to do it, Pa?

1162
01:14:57,295 --> 01:14:59,266
How come you never put
any notches on your gun?

1163
01:15:42,688 --> 01:15:44,659
John, did you see
your father?

1164
01:15:45,051 --> 01:15:46,609
Where are you going?

1165
01:15:55,147 --> 01:15:59,166
Wes. What is it?
What's wrong?
What did you say to him?

1166
01:15:59,236 --> 01:16:01,751
I hit him, Rosie.
I hit him.

1167
01:16:03,004 --> 01:16:04,213
Why? Why?

1168
01:16:05,081 --> 01:16:06,485
That gun!

1169
01:16:08,435 --> 01:16:10,852
He put it on
and it was me, 20 years ago.

1170
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:13,474
Thinking I could
lick the world with a gun!

1171
01:16:14,792 --> 01:16:16,197
I went crazy and I hit him.

1172
01:16:16,262 --> 01:16:18,940
It'll be all right, Wes.
You'll explain it to him.
It'll be all right.

1173
01:16:19,009 --> 01:16:22,319
I don't think it will, Rosie.
He'll be out
looking for trouble.

1174
01:16:22,491 --> 01:16:24,015
Don't say that.
He's a good boy.

1175
01:16:24,088 --> 01:16:25,514
He'll be out
looking for trouble!

1176
01:16:25,589 --> 01:16:27,147
What do you mean?

1177
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,864
It's happened before.
It's happened to me.
I remember.

1178
01:16:29,934 --> 01:16:31,905
My pa and me!

1179
01:16:31,979 --> 01:16:34,397
I'm going after him.
I'm gonna bring him home.

1180
01:16:40,092 --> 01:16:41,878
Hello, John.
What can I do for you?

1181
01:16:41,945 --> 01:16:43,088
Whisky.

1182
01:16:43,542 --> 01:16:45,959
I didn't know
you'd started drinking.

1183
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:48,455
You seen your Pa?

1184
01:16:48,558 --> 01:16:51,335
The boys said they seen him
coming through town
a little while ago.

1185
01:16:51,402 --> 01:16:54,179
Look, I came in here
for a drink, not to answer
a lot of dumb questions.

1186
01:16:54,244 --> 01:16:56,029
All right, all right.

1187
01:16:56,096 --> 01:16:58,035
Whisky. What makes you
so tough today, Hardin?

1188
01:16:58,109 --> 01:16:59,830
'Cause your old man is home?

1189
01:16:59,962 --> 01:17:01,520
Figures the old man will
back him up.

1190
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:02,995
Why don't you shut up!

1191
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:05,641
Think you're man enough?
Why don't you make me
shut up?

1192
01:17:05,712 --> 01:17:08,773
Maybe he'll show us
his pa's famous trick of
carrying a gun under his vest

1193
01:17:08,843 --> 01:17:10,727
so he can shoot
a man in the back
when he ain't looking.

1194
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:13,819
You better go on home, son.
No sense in starting
anything with him.

1195
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:16,536
You know... You know,
if I was Wes Hardin,

1196
01:17:16,605 --> 01:17:19,415
and came home from the pen
after 16 years,
first thing I'd do

1197
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:23,052
is un-limber my six-gun
and start banging away
at the nearest target.

1198
01:17:23,122 --> 01:17:24,265
(LAUGHS)

1199
01:17:24,336 --> 01:17:28,519
Especially if I was coming
home to a swell-Iooking
woman like Mrs. Hardin.

1200
01:17:28,584 --> 01:17:30,469
Easy, Son, easy.

1201
01:17:30,565 --> 01:17:32,350
You stay out of this.
It's my fight.

1202
01:17:32,417 --> 01:17:34,203
There's not gonna
be any fight.

1203
01:17:35,101 --> 01:17:37,170
Here's his gun. Keep it.

1204
01:17:38,423 --> 01:17:41,647
All right,
the boy's not armed now,
and neither am I,

1205
01:17:42,576 --> 01:17:45,702
so see that you don't
shoot off anything
but your mouth.

1206
01:17:45,771 --> 01:17:48,930
I'll take care of you
another time
with a horse-whip. Come on.

1207
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:50,075
I ain't afraid
of you, Hardin,

1208
01:17:50,147 --> 01:17:52,598
even if you have got a gun
under your coat,
so draw and fire.

1209
01:17:55,993 --> 01:17:57,932
What did I tell you?
Didn't you see him reach?

1210
01:17:58,005 --> 01:17:59,018
Give me my gun!

1211
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,997
No. Don't give it
to him.

1212
01:18:01,232 --> 01:18:03,116
Somebody get Doc Barker.

1213
01:18:06,184 --> 01:18:07,675
I thought you said
he had a gun.

1214
01:18:08,227 --> 01:18:10,612
He reached, I tell you.
You all saw it.

1215
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,278
He was wearing a gun under arm
when he killed Webb.

1216
01:18:12,349 --> 01:18:13,492
Don't try anything.

1217
01:18:13,563 --> 01:18:14,935
(ALL YELLING)

1218
01:18:17,747 --> 01:18:18,728
I'll get him for this.

1219
01:18:18,833 --> 01:18:22,755
No, you're not gonna live
the way I lived

1220
01:18:23,018 --> 01:18:25,567
and end up like this
on a dirty floor.

1221
01:18:26,276 --> 01:18:29,816
It'd be my fault, Son.
Don't you understand?

1222
01:18:31,131 --> 01:18:32,275
Leave it alone.

1223
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:36,399
He'll get his,
but you leave it alone.

1224
01:18:37,617 --> 01:18:38,859
Swear it to me.

1225
01:18:39,565 --> 01:18:41,602
I swear it, Pa.
I swear it.

1226
01:18:43,782 --> 01:18:46,842
Keep him quiet for a couple
of weeks, Mrs. Hardin,
and he'll be all right.

1227
01:18:46,912 --> 01:18:48,697
I'll come out and have
another look at him
this evening.

1228
01:18:48,765 --> 01:18:50,105
Thank you, Doctor.

1229
01:18:50,171 --> 01:18:51,575
Now, John,
you drive real slow.

1230
01:18:51,641 --> 01:18:52,915
Sure, Ma.

1231
01:18:53,206 --> 01:18:57,258
Remember the last time
we rode in a wagon, Rosie?
A long time ago.

1232
01:18:57,454 --> 01:19:00,068
Yeah, but this time
is different, Wes.

1233
01:19:00,138 --> 01:19:01,696
This time we know
where we're going.

1234
01:19:02,596 --> 01:19:03,577
John?

1235
01:19:03,652 --> 01:19:04,762
Yes, Pa?

1236
01:19:04,833 --> 01:19:06,292
Let's go home.
