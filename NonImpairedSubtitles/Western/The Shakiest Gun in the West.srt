1
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,886
<i>He's corny as corn bread
seedy as grain</i>

2
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:29,122
<i>He came out west
on a northbound train</i>

3
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,959
<i>The crooks die laughing
but they're deadjust the same</i>

4
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,432
<i>He's the shakiest gun in the West</i>

5
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,469
<i>Yeah</i>

6
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,801
<i>He's the shakiest gun in the West</i>

7
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,933
<i>He's got a phony pony
that was made in Japan</i>

8
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,807
<i>He rides in the saddle
like an elevator man</i>

9
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,973
<i>He's an underfoot tenderfoot
king of the mess</i>

10
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,677
<i>He's the shakiest gun in the West</i>

11
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:53,651
<i>Yeah</i>

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,245
<i>He's the shakiest gun in the West</i>

13
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:58,950
<i>But he stands for right</i>

14
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:01,858
<i>Both day and night</i>

15
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:06,592
<i>He may lose the battle for a while</i>

16
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:10,602
<i>But he'll win the fight</i>

17
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,798
<i>He's a humdinger
a western swinger</i>

18
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:17,240
<i>But he has a little trouble
with his trigger finger</i>

19
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,143
<i>When he takes aim
it's anybody's guess</i>

20
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,738
<i>He's the shakiest gun in the West</i>

21
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,750
<i>Yeah</i>

22
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,719
<i>He's the shakiest gun in the West</i>

23
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:31,188
<i>He's a dude done over
you can see at a glance</i>

24
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,522
<i>His boots are shiny
and so are his pants</i>

25
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,188
<i>He's got hair in his eye
and a gleam on his chest</i>

26
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,925
<i>He's the shakiest gun in the West</i>

27
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,990
<i>Yeah</i>

28
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,332
<i>He's the shakiest gun in the West</i>

29
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:47,032
<i>But he stands for right</i>

30
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,201
<i>Both day and night</i>

31
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:54,940
<i>He may lose the battle for a while</i>

32
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:57,983
<i>But he'll win the fight</i>

33
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,781
<i>Yeah, he stands for right</i>

34
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,550
<i>Both day and night</i>

35
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:10,629
<i>Oh, help.! Help.! Help.!</i>

36
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,666
Help! Ohhh!

37
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:17,635
Help! Help!

38
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:22,472
Madam, madam,
please be patient.

39
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,909
After all, this is the final
examination for these dental students.

40
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,107
It's important
that you cooperate.

41
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:33,380
Now, stay in your chair
and try to relax.

42
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,921
Golly Ned, Mother!

43
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,924
<i>Relax. Up we go.</i>

44
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:47,723
All right.

45
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,896
You just sit down there.
There we go.

46
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:56,601
All righty, Miss Stevenson.
Now, first things first.

47
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:01,340
Now we're just gonna take a little
look-see at your general dental condition.

48
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,281
Sort of get
the lay of the land.

49
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,377
You know? Okay.
All righty, open your mouth.

50
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:14,693
No, no, you see, if, uh...

51
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:18,060
if you don't open your mouth,
then I can't see anything.

52
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,157
See? That's the way
that works.

53
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:25,864
Uh, come on now, Miss Stevenson.
Seriously. Open your mouth.

54
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,204
Open up.
Come on, come on.

55
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:32,767
I'll help you here. I'll get
that... There. Open that...

56
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,747
How're you doing, Heywood? Fine. Fine.

57
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,624
Dr. Friedlander?

58
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,961
What seems to be
the trouble, Heywood?

59
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,100
Complete closure
of the oral cavity, eh?

60
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,105
She won't open her mouth.

61
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,437
Watch me carefully.

62
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:05,671
Well, Miss Stevenson,
don't we look lovely today.

63
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,077
But we have a toothache,
haven't we?

64
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:12,106
A tooth saved is a silver dollar
in the bank of health.

65
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,710
Now, open your mouth, dear.

66
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,757
Op... Open wide.

67
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:27,422
Are we going to open up
that mouth?

68
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,861
Open that rotten
little mouth!

69
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,372
You're in my way, Heywood.
You're in my way!

70
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,543
I can't...
I can't get loose.

71
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,645
Wait 'til I get...

72
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,423
Get me out of here!

73
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,200
You're on your own
from here on, Heywood.

74
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:06,204
If you don't get that mouth
open and get that tooth fixed,

75
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:09,366
you don't graduate.
Mm-hmm.

76
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,424
Now, Miss Stevenson,

77
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:30,360
I realize that this is hardly the
time or place to bring this up,

78
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,389
but, uh, I'd like very much
to see you socially sometime.

79
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,664
Oh! Well, I, uh...
There!

80
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,570
Everything going
okay, Heywood?

81
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:46,134
Fine. Uh-huh. Fine.

82
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,813
Mm-hmm.

83
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:49,131
All right, make way
for the mother of a dentist.

84
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:53,502
The mother ofJesse W. Heywood,
valedictorian.

85
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,640
I'm her best friend.

86
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,727
Uh, Dr. Friedlander,

87
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:23,098
faculty, students...

88
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,104
and parents.

89
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,409
As we, uh, stand
on the threshold...

90
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,973
<i>Louder.! As we stand on
the threshold of graduation,</i>

91
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,486
we may get the feeling
that this is the end.

92
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,628
<i>This is really the beginning...
Louder.!</i>

93
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,095
This is really the beginning...

94
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:55,565
of stepping out into new horizons:

95
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,570
north, south, east...

96
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,664
and... west.

97
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,600
Speaking of west,
that is the direc...

98
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,146
that is the direction
that I personally am going to.

99
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,944
<i>Why did I choose the West?</i>

100
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:16,785
Because the West is a place
where few, if any, dentists have trod.

101
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:19,324
So I am going to trod there.

102
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:24,824
Why, Jesse? Why?

103
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,866
Well, Mom,
the West needs dentists.

104
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,732
I mean, teeth are fallin' out
right and left out there.

105
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:33,931
Teeth are falling out
in Philadelphia too.

106
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:38,875
Yeah, but Philadelphia is overrun
with dentists. There must be seven!

107
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:43,177
Gratitude! Gratitude!
Some nice gratitude!

108
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:47,379
But all the plans,
all the nice surprises.

109
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:51,355
Your Uncle George was going to give
you an office over the harness shop...

110
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,085
for $3.00 a month.

111
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:56,185
And Celia's Leonard
was going to give you...

112
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,924
four rolls of wallpaper.

113
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,432
Blue ducks.

114
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,832
Fifty cents a foot!
Wholesale!

115
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,837
Oh, Jesse!

116
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,135
Jesse, Jesse, Jesse!

117
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:11,836
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom.

118
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:15,813
If he were mine, I'd know what
to do. Put him across my knee.

119
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:18,145
Butt out!
I'm family!

120
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,447
You're not family!
I'm your aunt!

121
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,579
You're not a real aunt. Just my
mother's best friend. Oh, yeah?

122
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:24,816
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah?

123
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,223
How's it going, Heywood? Fine. Fine.

124
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:39,465
Those half-naked savages
must have colds all the time.

125
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,904
Oh, Ma, that's
an old wives' tale.

126
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,943
Your average Indian's
the healthiest person in the world.

127
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:48,174
But, Jesse, dear, it stands
to reason... Uh, Ma, Ma, Ma!

128
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,545
Call me "Doctor."

129
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:53,312
Oh, excuse me,
is this car 24?

130
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,786
Uh, all the way down, mack.
Thank you.

131
00:10:55,855 --> 00:11:00,690
But, Doctor, you've always been
such a delicate little boy.

132
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,456
You've got such touchy sinuses.

133
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,327
You've always had your
father's delicate sinuses.

134
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,924
Aw, Ma!
Now don't "aw" me.

135
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,765
It was your father's
sinuses that killed him.

136
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,203
He was run over
by a beer wagon!

137
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:17,709
He was blowing his nose
in the middle of the street.

138
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,575
Well, I'm not going to cry.

139
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,580
Good for you, Ma.

140
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:25,811
I promised myself
I wouldn't cry.

141
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,819
Attagirl.

142
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,321
If you don't believe me,
ask Celia.

143
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,415
I said, "Celia, I'm not
going to cry at the station."

144
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:36,928
And you've always
kept your word, Ma.

145
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,658
Uh, is this car 24?

146
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:43,327
Uh, back that way.
Huh. Well...

147
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,371
I'll bet you think
I'm crying right now.

148
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,274
You promised yourself
you wouldn't. And I'm not!

149
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:54,312
<i>That's 'cause
you're strong, Ma.</i>

150
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,281
Just think, Ma.

151
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,283
Gettin' ready to head west.

152
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,047
In two days, I'll be in Ohio.

153
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,453
In one week, I'll be in St. Louis.

154
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:07,549
And in two months,
California!

155
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:10,322
What an age we live in.

156
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,763
Things are moving too fast.

157
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,202
Excuse me, bunky.
Is this about it?

158
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,573
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Thank you. Thank you.

159
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,612
Well, Ma...

160
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,679
Oh! Oh, uh...

161
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,054
Ma, you got something
for the porter? Got a nickel?

162
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,093
A nickel?

163
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:48,092
Uh, n-no charge.

164
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,971
Ma, what's that?

165
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:57,065
Well, it got your Uncle Metcalf
safely through the Civil War.

166
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,543
Here, you may need it.

167
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,477
Well, gee, Ma,
that's kind of nifty.

168
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,950
Wear it in good health.

169
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,078
<i>Board.!</i>

170
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:14,892
Well, Ma, I guess this is it.

171
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,555
Good-bye, dear.

172
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,759
Write me as soon
as you get to the West.

173
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,802
I will, Ma.

174
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,878
Don't look back, Ma.

175
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,938
Goin' out west, partner?

176
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,338
Sure am, partner.

177
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,160
<i>Naka washa.</i>

178
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:03,501
Well...
thank you, dear lady.

179
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,966
Oh, uh, thank you,
dear lady.

180
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,837
Mmm!

181
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,577
That's good!
What is that?

182
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:22,018
Wana tonka.
Wana tonka?

183
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,055
Lizard roll.

184
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:39,070
Rest stop! Rest stop!

185
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:00,687
All right, everybody out
of that stage. Come on!

186
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,797
Come on!

187
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,558
<i>Come on, let's go.!</i>

188
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,867
And you up there,
throw down that strongbox!

189
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,512
<i>Hold it, driver.!</i>

190
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,060
Go ahead!

191
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,139
Whoa! Whoa!

192
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,140
What happened, Arthur?

193
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:27,008
Two men held us up out on the Willow
Creek Road. They got the strongbox.

194
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,639
All right.
Come on, men. Let's go.

195
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,559
I just love this kind
of stuff. Oh, come on!

196
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:55,240
Fred, got a passenger for ya
on the through stage.

197
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,468
Be sure he gets on it.

198
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:27,401
Hot digs!
Come to 2,200 apiece.

199
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,310
<i>You know something, Penny?
This is the first time...</i>

200
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:37,940
I ever had this much money
at one time in my whole life.

201
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:41,213
There's plenty more
where that came from, Pop.

202
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:45,086
I got two stagecoaches lined up
next week. A hundred miles apart.

203
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:48,422
Hold it, Penny. Count me out. What?

204
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:51,520
That's right. This was my last job.

205
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:57,001
After 30 years of rustling cattle
and holding up banks, I'm packing it in.

206
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:00,505
This'll be easy pickin's, Pop.

207
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,302
No. I'm gonna take
this here money...

208
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,935
and fulfill my lifelong ambition.

209
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,945
What's that, Pop?

210
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:11,813
Go to Boston and open up
a little dress shop.

211
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,944
A dress shop?

212
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,750
Well, wait a minute, Penny.

213
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,986
Just 'cause I'm rough and dirty
and don't wear underwear,

214
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,926
don't mean that I ain't artistic.

215
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,955
All the years we've been together,
I never heard you mention that once.

216
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:33,437
Well, I reckon it would sound kind of
funny in front of the other gentlemen.

217
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:37,032
Well, if that's
the way you want it.

218
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:41,205
At least we can ride together
as far as Hole in the Wall.

219
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,483
A dress shop?
Hold it, Penny!

220
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,383
What is it?

221
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:52,651
Sounds like maybe 10 or 15 horses.

222
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:56,125
Nice posse size.
Let's get outta here.

223
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:30,692
Whoa! Whoa! Penny, there
ain't but one thing to do.

224
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:33,629
They're gainin' on us.
We gotta split up.

225
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,758
You follow
that stream there.

226
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:39,133
I'll head north and try to
draw 'em off. Good luck, honey.

227
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,138
Don't get caught, Pop.
Remember your dress shop.

228
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:58,117
Yeah, it looks like one of'em.

229
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,353
I just love this kind of stuff.

230
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,519
Let's go.

231
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:57,975
I just hate this kind of
stuff! Grab her, Floyd!

232
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,109
Where?
Where?

233
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:04,451
I don't know about grabbin'
women! I ain't married!

234
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:07,788
Where's that federal
marshal? He's on his way over.

235
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,793
You've got no right!

236
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:13,888
You've got no right holding
a defenseless woman prisoner!

237
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:24,806
Now simmer down!
You just simmer down, Penny.

238
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:27,868
Marshal Bates here
wants to talk to you.

239
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:30,540
Miss Cushings,
I've got a proposition for you.

240
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,310
Not interested!

241
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:36,411
Better hear me out.
This paper's a full pardon.

242
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:40,584
You dang fool! The marshal wants you
to work for the federal government.

243
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,787
It's a trick!
I just love this kind of stuff!

244
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:47,354
No, it's no trick.
Now listen to me carefully.

245
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:51,368
Somebody's been smuggling guns
to some renegade Comanche Indians.

246
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:53,370
What's that got to do with me?

247
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:55,736
<i>We need your help
to find out who it is.</i>

248
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:59,004
The marshal wants you to work
as an undercover agent.

249
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:01,170
<i>We've already lost two men.</i>

250
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:04,977
We figure they won't be suspicious
of a woman posin' as a homesteader.

251
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,616
Well, what do you think, Penny?

252
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,088
I don't know.

253
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:15,524
We got enough on you
to send you away for 300 years.

254
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:20,596
Ya ninny! He wants
to give you a pardon!

255
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:23,065
Here, read this.

256
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:30,072
Is it a real pardon?

257
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:33,077
It's got the governor's
signature on it.

258
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,506
You got yourself a deal.

259
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,813
Hey, this is
pretty excitin'.

260
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,912
You mind if
I tell everybody?

261
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:47,481
You do and I'll shoot you...
right in the mouth.

262
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,048
Excuse me, sir.

263
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,552
Could you tell me where I could buy
a wagon and a good team of horses?

264
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,213
Yep. Right across
the street there.

265
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,690
Abel Swanson will sell you
anything you want.

266
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,489
But watch him.
He's real slick.

267
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,496
He'll cheat you
if he gets a chance.

268
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:29,000
Yeah? Well, he'll have to get up
pretty early in the morning...

269
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:32,195
to pull the wool
overJesse W. Heywood's eyes.

270
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,238
Much obliged.

271
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,536
Love your hat!

272
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,456
Mr. Swanson?

273
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:55,118
Oh. Howdy.

274
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:58,993
I'd like to see Mr. Swanson about
gettin' a good rig and a team.

275
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:05,363
Well, I don't know
anything about that.

276
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,600
And you can tell him that just
because I'm from out of town,

277
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,972
<i>that don't mean I don't
know what it's all about.!</i>

278
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,816
Good day, sir. Abel Swanson,
proprietor, at your service.

279
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:30,885
Dr. Jesse W. Heywood,
dentist, Philadelphia.

280
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:35,331
Ah, a professional man! What a pleasure
to do business with a man of science!

281
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,029
Wong, our house is honored
by the presence of a physician.

282
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:53,413
Wong reveres knowledge.
We are at your service.

283
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,476
Uh, well...

284
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,489
I want to get a rig
and a couple of good strong horses.

285
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,491
And I'll pay nothin'
but a fair price.

286
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,551
It's a pleasure to do business
with a discerning man.

287
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:06,722
Now, everything you need
is right over here.

288
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,562
There's a potbellied stove,
wrought iron skillet,

289
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:12,398
twenty pounds of flour,
one axe, two extra handles.

290
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:16,600
Now, let's see. A stove, $7.50; skillet,
$4.20; flour, $8.50; $9.75 for an axe.

291
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:19,974
Add that up,
will you, Wong?

292
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:26,409
That comes to $47, even.
Now for the wagon...

293
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,611
Wait a minute.
Hold it. Hold it!

294
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:32,088
Forty-seven dollars?
The stove was $7.50.

295
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:36,355
The skillet was $4.20.
That's $11.70. Then you have...

296
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,056
<i>Have you ever been in the Orient, sir? Huh?</i>

297
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,997
Have you ever been
in the Orient?

298
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,001
No, I never have.

299
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:47,061
<i>That's amazing.
Simply amazing.</i>

300
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:50,904
Wong, observe the analytical mind
of the trained scientist.

301
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:53,911
Skilled in the arts of mathematics,
physics, chemistry.

302
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:58,143
<i>Able to understand the machinations
of the Oriental calculating abacus.</i>

303
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:02,084
Run over those figures
for him again, Wong.

304
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,547
Yeah. That's $47, all right.

305
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,493
Extraordinary mind.
You, sir, are amazing.

306
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:13,998
Now, let's put you into a wagon.
Right this way.

307
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,033
Okay.

308
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,863
You are indeed
a fortunate man!

309
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,202
This is your lucky day!

310
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,833
The wagon you are beholding...
soon to be yours...

311
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:27,377
is the only one of its kind
west of the Mississippi.

312
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:29,379
How much is it?
Built of the finest oak.

313
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:32,280
Once owned by one of the
great pioneers of our west,

314
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,410
the late Sir Lincoln Boone.

315
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:50,859
I know this is no time
to bring this up, but how much is it?

316
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:54,302
Excuse me. I'll let it go
for a hundred dollars.

317
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:57,364
How much? One hundred and fifty dollars.

318
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,774
Now that seems
kind of expensive to me!

319
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:03,905
Expensive? Too expensive
for a vehicle worthy of transporting...

320
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:06,280
one of the great scientific minds
of our day?

321
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,342
Sir, this wagon befits you.

322
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:13,414
Wong, let us not forget. Our house is
honored by the presence of a physician.

323
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:19,021
Uh, well... Now wait a...
That's enough. I, uh...

324
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:21,964
Now listen, I think 150 will be okay. Sold!

325
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:25,525
Wong, add that up.
Forty-seven and 150.

326
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:30,605
That comes to $232.55.

327
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,166
$232.55?

328
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,212
That is correct.

329
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,841
Well, figures don't lie.

330
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,818
That's an even $250
with the territory tax.

331
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,013
And that'll be cash,
of course.

332
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:49,152
Territory tax?

333
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:53,459
<i>Gracias. It was a pleasure doing
business with you, sir. Chop-chop!</i>

334
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:56,261
Uh, I'll see you.
Oh, wait a minute!

335
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:59,303
I-I almost forgot.
Well, what about the horses?

336
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:03,602
Why, surely you jest. There hasn't been
a horse for sale in over three weeks.

337
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,337
Wait a second!
If you didn't have any horses for sale,

338
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,346
how come you sold me
that wagon and all that stuff?

339
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,247
We just like to keep busy.
You have no right to...

340
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:16,310
What time do you have, sir?
Huh? Oh, 5:30.

341
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:19,515
We're closed. Well...
Now just wait a minute!

342
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,958
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Why, you...

343
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:26,190
How am I gonna get out west
if I don't have any horses?

344
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:29,358
You... You cheaters! Cheaters!

345
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:33,370
Abacus cadabacus!

346
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,571
Mr. Huggins?
That's right.

347
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,775
Penelope Cushings.
Won't you come in?

348
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,249
What can I do for you,
Miss Cushings?

349
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:26,688
First, I must warn you, I'm
not taking on any new clients.

350
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:29,226
I expect to be
leaving town shortly.

351
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:32,354
The moon is on the wane.

352
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,364
You?

353
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,957
You were looking
for a woman, weren't you?

354
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:40,698
Well, yes, but you're...
Well, not like you.

355
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:44,264
Expecting someone
a bit more horsey?

356
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,276
Sort of.

357
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:50,508
Well, I'm what they came up with,
so let's get down to business.

358
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:54,348
We're to take the wagon train to San
Miguel with you posing as my wife.

359
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,354
Oh?
Strictly federal business.

360
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:00,220
Once there,
we get in touch with Will Banks.

361
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:03,727
<i>You've got a rig?
Waiting out in the staging area.</i>

362
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:06,821
Any notion as to how the rifles
are getting to the Indians?

363
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:10,800
Nope. There could even be some
on the wagon train we're taking.

364
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:16,032
Well, now, do you have everything
you need? Yes, I think so.

365
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:19,599
Good. We'll leave
day after tomorrow at sunup.

366
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:22,202
Strictly federal business?

367
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,407
Strictly.

368
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:26,541
Done and done.

369
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:05,914
That's Sam Huggins, the lawyer.

370
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:09,687
Who did it? Shots came from across
the street. This fellow staggered in.

371
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,628
- Did anybody call a doctor?
- Doc Gifford's out of town.

372
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,894
Wait a minute. There's a doctor
right here in the hotel.

373
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:21,728
Dr. Jesse W. Heywood.
Room three.

374
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:24,240
Come on, Lyle!
Ernie, come on!

375
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:42,217
Hurry it up!
He don't answer.

376
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:49,365
Darn you, Lyle!
Dr. Heywood!

377
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:52,062
Dr. Heywood!
Wake up! Wake up!

378
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,331
<i>Let's go up there.!</i>

379
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:57,670
We're coming! Dr. Heywood,
Dr. Heywood! Please, wake up!

380
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:01,234
Doctor, we have an
emergency in the lobby.

381
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:04,543
Hmm. Emergency.

382
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:15,449
Hmm? Yeah.
I'm awake. I'm awake.

383
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:27,162
All right, everybody.
Stand back. Give this man air.

384
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:30,207
He's probably got
a badly impacted wisdom tooth.

385
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,572
You fool!
Here's the trouble.

386
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:51,285
Hey, you sure handled that
nice last night, Doc.

387
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:03,496
Uh... morning!

388
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:17,852
Uh, look, I hope I didn't give
the hotel a bad name by fainting.

389
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:20,550
I mean, I feel bad about that.
Makes me feel terrible.

390
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,458
Your shoe's untied.

391
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:26,554
Oh, yeah. Thank you.
Well, I'll just, uh...

392
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:29,794
I'll, uh, tie it over here.

393
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:38,074
Oh, uh... uh, ma'am?

394
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:41,703
Ma'am? Wa...
Wait just...

395
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:44,247
Just... wa...

396
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:51,313
Uh, ma'am!
Oh, ma'am!

397
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:54,381
Uh, ma'am.
Excuse me, ma'am.

398
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:57,860
I just wanted to express
my deepest sympathy...

399
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,090
and to apologize for, uh...

400
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:02,962
well, what happened
to me there last night.

401
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:06,333
See, actually I'm a dentist.
See, I'm not a doctor.

402
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:09,066
And, well, when I see
something like that,

403
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,438
I just sort of go all fuzzy.

404
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:16,071
What's a tender ninny like you
doing out here in the first place?

405
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:20,543
Uh, ma'am, uh...

406
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:24,748
Now I realize that that may have
come about as a result of your grief.

407
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:28,087
But I don't like to be
called a tender ninny.

408
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:31,720
Tender ninny!

409
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:36,358
Okay. All right.
Now, all right.

410
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:40,598
I'm gonna tell you something.
I'm in teeth!

411
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:45,574
And I came out here all the way from Philadelphia
single-handed to fight oral ignorance!

412
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,736
And I intend to go
further west!

413
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,712
West is that way.

414
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,408
West! And I'm gonna
find me a couple of horses,

415
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,509
and I'm leaving on
the next wagon train out!

416
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:58,020
Now what do you think
about that?

417
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:02,685
Um, are you going to take your
tree and your dog along with you?

418
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,345
<i>I'm sorry about your
husband passin'on, ma'am,</i>

419
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:24,506
but rules are rules
and I gotta stick to 'em.

420
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,551
No women alone
on the wagon train.

421
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:30,553
Uh, look, Mr. Welsh, I have
got to get on this wagon train.

422
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:32,782
No single women.
Company rules.

423
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,553
Well, I've got to find some way.

424
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:40,086
The only thing I can recommend is you find
yourself a husband by 5:00 tomorrow mornin'.

425
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:41,893
A husband?
Mm-hmm.

426
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:46,460
All you need is somethin'
wearin' pants goin' that way.

427
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,007
Uh, west is that...

428
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:54,144
way.

429
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:45,828
Oh!

430
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:49,195
Hello, Dentist.

431
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,963
Hello!

432
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,903
Uh... it's you!

433
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:58,430
Aren't you going
to ask me to come in?

434
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:03,208
Huh? Oh... Oh, sure!
Yeah! Come in, come in.

435
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:12,415
Oh, uh...
I like to keep my hand in.

436
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,694
I'm sorry to bother you like this,

437
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:24,224
but I have a terrible toothache.

438
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,570
Is it in your mouth?
Oh, yeah.

439
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,573
It would be, wouldn't it?

440
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:34,133
Sure. Well, you just
sit right down there,

441
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:36,679
and we'll just take care of it.

442
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:39,215
I probably should have
made an appointment.

443
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:41,547
I realize how busy you must be.

444
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,520
Oh, golly, heck!
There's always...

445
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:47,853
always room for an emerg...

446
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:50,325
emergency.

447
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:00,760
Uh...

448
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,535
I'll just, uh...

449
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:07,441
Wait a min... Uh, well...

450
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:14,446
I'll tell you what. Could you
just, uh... open your mouth?

451
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:43,280
Uh... l... I need my mirror.

452
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:45,315
Oh.

453
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,482
That's okay.

454
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,488
I'll get, uh...
get something else here.

455
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,462
Oh, do you know something?
Hmm?

456
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:03,989
When you turned away,
I noticed your profile.

457
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,970
It's really very attractive.

458
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:11,701
My profile?

459
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,643
Well...

460
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,081
Huh?

461
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:22,779
Oh, your hands!
Oh, they're lovely!

462
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:25,219
The hands of a surgeon.

463
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:29,783
Yeah, well, my ha...

464
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,929
Well, uh...

465
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:41,031
hands have always
run in my family.

466
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:45,102
Do you know what I think?

467
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,110
Uh-uh.

468
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,942
I think you're very nice.

469
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:52,107
Do you know what I think?

470
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,117
What?

471
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,449
I think I might faint.

472
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,953
Ohhh.

473
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,626
How did a wonderful
professional man like you...

474
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:12,533
escape marriage
all these years?

475
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:17,734
Well, uh, I've always felt I was
a little too thin for marriage.

476
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,742
Ohhh.

477
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:24,474
And besides, m-my main mission
in life right now i-i-is to go west.

478
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,910
How strange fate is!

479
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:32,080
I, too, am alone
and going west.

480
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,785
And suddenly,
out of the blue sky,

481
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,727
I meet you.

482
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,932
A big...

483
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,833
tall...

484
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,837
handsome...

485
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,964
man!

486
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,871
Now, wait a minute!
J-Just wait a minute!

487
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:00,109
I-I don't even know you.

488
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,709
I'm crazy about you.
Isn't that enough?

489
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:06,779
<i>Now then, the witnesses there, Mrs.
Longbaugh and Slosh White, are 25 cents each,</i>

490
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,291
payable immediately
following the ceremony.

491
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,885
Fine. Speed it up.
The wagon train leaves in an hour.

492
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:13,896
This is so sudden,
Miss Cushings.

493
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:17,422
I mean, you just don't fix a tooth
one minute and get married the next.

494
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:20,493
The song is 50 cents extra.
Would you like the song?

495
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,300
Yes. Fine, fine.

496
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:27,237
Oh, promise me
that someday...

497
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,074
Let's go, Reverend!

498
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:31,080
During the music?
Yes!

499
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:33,742
Well, all right.

500
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:36,183
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here...

501
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:38,312
Now wait a minute!
Hold it!

502
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,483
I can't get married
without telling my mother.

503
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,926
There isn't any time. We've
got to catch the wagon train,

504
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:47,156
uh, uh, uh...

505
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,426
Jesse.
Jesse.

506
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,094
My mother will just
never forgive me for this.

507
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:56,367
We are assembled here in the presence
of God to join together this man...

508
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,136
Now wa... We're strangers.
You know that, don't you?

509
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,541
<i>I'd at least like you
to meet my mother.</i>

510
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,773
Speed it up, Reverend.

511
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:06,816
He has instructed those who have
entered into this relationship, etc.

512
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:09,409
That's not Episcopalian!

513
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:11,545
By the authority invested
in me by the Church,

514
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,988
I declare that you, Penelope,
and, uh, you, uh...

515
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,390
Jesse.

516
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,894
And you, Jesse,
are hereby man and wife.

517
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:21,693
Attaboy, Reverend!
Now, just hold it!

518
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:26,134
I don't feel at all that this is
actually... I mean, the whole... the thing...

519
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:28,171
Mm-hmm.

520
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:41,144
We'd better hurry if we want
to catch that wagon train.

521
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,725
Well, well, well. You did it,
ma'am. What's the new name?

522
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:52,455
Dr. and Mrs. Jesse W.
Heywood. You ready to go?

523
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:54,463
Wagons west!

524
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:56,761
That's the ticket. Just pull up
behind that last wagon.

525
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,302
Right.

526
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,395
Nice going.

527
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,930
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just so darned excited.

528
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:11,447
Mr. and Mrs. Hiram Remington. Atlanta.

529
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:15,042
Dr. and Mrs. Jesse W.
Heywood. Philadelphia.

530
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:23,882
Dr. and Mrs. Jesse W.
Heywood. Philadelphia.

531
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:28,898
Reverend Zachary Gant and my
loyal minion, Matthew Basch!

532
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,594
Nice couple.

533
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:35,400
Fix this crate. What are you
trying to do, get us thrown in jail?

534
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:38,771
Aww, a "purty" little thing
like that and a derby dude,

535
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,310
they ain't likely
to be federal men.

536
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:43,608
We can't trust anybody.

537
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,115
Now remember that!
Come on, fix it!

538
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:54,247
Where's Willie?

539
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:56,258
Beats me.

540
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:59,090
Willie! Willie!

541
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:01,757
Here, Ma.

542
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:05,700
I told you to do that
before we left!

543
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,472
Oh, boy!

544
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,373
Keep your eye
on the road.

545
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:18,475
I just can't believe it.

546
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,347
Tonight's our wedding night.

547
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:29,386
In a few hours,
we'll stop...

548
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,758
make camp...

549
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:35,128
have a little supper...

550
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,827
then beddy-bye.

551
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,544
I was in the same boat
as you 35 years ago.

552
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,546
Is that right?

553
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,549
I'll never forget my wedding
night as long as I live.

554
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,847
I'll bet.
I cried like a baby.

555
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,392
<i>Willie.!</i>

556
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,860
<i>Almost done, Ma.</i>

557
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:51,297
Penelope?

558
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:54,572
Penelope?

559
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,670
<i>What do you want?</i>

560
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:59,716
Are you beddy-bye?

561
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:02,581
<i>I suppose so.</i>

562
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:10,989
Guard duty, Dr. Heywood.

563
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:13,529
You're kidding!

564
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,616
A coyote.

565
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:07,543
Hoot owl.

566
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,522
Aaah!
Scare ya?

567
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:21,530
Heck no! You kiddin'?

568
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:25,534
I come to relieve you, Doc. I reckon you
got some chores you want to fulfill, huh?

569
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:28,127
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Thanks. Good luck.

570
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:49,925
I'm back.

571
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:21,917
You're soft.

572
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:46,476
Come on, you little dickins!
I'll find you!

573
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:54,620
Come on now! Come on now!
Wh-Where ar... are you?

574
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:15,210
Penny!
What are you doing?

575
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:17,007
That you, Willie?

576
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:21,951
What are you doing
wandering around? Shut up!

577
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:27,523
<i>What's going on here?</i>

578
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:34,553
I couldn't sleep,
so I decided to take a walk.

579
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:36,758
That's all.

580
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:41,270
Well, you'd be lonesome, too,
if your husband were on guard duty.

581
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:43,670
It's our wedding night.

582
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:51,503
Lovers' quarrel, that's all.
All right, back to bed.

583
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:56,908
Gosh, honey, I didn't realize
you missed me so much.

584
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:01,257
I wonder what she's up to.

585
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:04,418
Don't you get it, Zack?
She's got the sweets on me.

586
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:07,190
I have the same trouble
every place I go.

587
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:10,665
Women just come runnin' after me,
wantin' to kiss me on the mouth.

588
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:41,255
<i>Everybody up.! Everybody up.!</i>

589
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:13,586
Indians! Indians!

590
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:17,252
Hyah!

591
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:28,203
What'll we do?

592
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:30,933
Take cover and start
using that six-gun!

593
00:54:58,528 --> 00:54:59,460
<i>They're Winchesters.</i>

594
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:01,463
The Heywood wagon.
It ain't with us.

595
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:04,193
Remington! Tyler!
Some of you men, let's go!

596
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:16,344
<i>Get back here, you idiot.!</i>

597
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:39,429
<i>Bang.</i>

598
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:50,378
Are you all right?
Uh-huh. Yeah. Fine.

599
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:52,472
Uh, I didn't know
you could shoot like that.

600
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,449
Huh, I didn't know it myself!

601
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:12,360
Who'd have believed it?

602
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:14,335
That Doc's a gutty little cuss.

603
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:33,680
Which one's Doc Heywood?
Right there.

604
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:35,691
There he is! Hey! Doc!

605
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:51,073
The greatest!
Attaboy, Doc!

606
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:54,133
To Doc Heywood,
Indian fighter!

607
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:59,212
Say, Doc, tell us just how
you killed all them Indians.

608
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:01,216
<i>Give him a chance to clear
the dust out ofhis throat.</i>

609
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:03,218
<i>Come on, Doc.
Drink up.!</i>

610
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:07,222
Oh. Well.

611
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:09,190
Hmm.

612
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:20,660
It doesn't pay to drink
too fast when you're thirsty.

613
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:22,637
That was good, though.
Was good.

614
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:30,173
<i>Say, Doc, now we hear tell that you
fell far behind the main wagon train.</i>

615
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:32,146
<i>How did that happen?</i>

616
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:37,052
Well, I'll tell you.

617
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,554
That was on purpose.

618
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:42,648
There was a reason for that.

619
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:46,183
You see, it was
all part of the plan.

620
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:48,662
It was all
part of the plan!

621
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:54,460
As I said,
it was all part of the plan.

622
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:58,803
See, I'd been spotting their signs
for quite a while.

623
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:03,312
He was a-spottin'
their signs!

624
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:06,610
One, maybe two months.

625
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:10,278
And then a plan began
a-formulatin' in my mind.

626
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:13,254
Then a plan began
a-formulatin' in his mind!

627
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:19,827
I figured I'd lay back a ways
and draw 'em off the main body.

628
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:25,663
That was to give the wagon train
a chance to get away.

629
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:28,636
Chance to get away! You
wanna let me tell this, fella?

630
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:37,508
See, there's one thing you gotta
keep in mind about Indians.

631
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:41,016
Them Indians is ten times
as scared as you are...

632
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:46,547
Didn't mean to scare
Indian fighter.

633
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:50,923
You character. One of ours.

634
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:59,360
I wonder.
What?

635
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:03,337
If that skinny little Philadelphia
jasper could be a federal agent.

636
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,705
He sure looks like
a dentist to me.

637
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:10,769
How would you know?

638
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:13,611
You ain't never seen
a dentist in your life.

639
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:17,685
No need to poke fun
at my only weak point.

640
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:27,529
I don't know what
you're talking about, lady.

641
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:29,861
I'm a roofer.
Been a roofer all my life.

642
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:32,231
Don't know nothing
about the federal government.

643
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:36,238
Sam Huggins would be talking
to you now, but they shot him.

644
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:40,107
Get in the wagon.

645
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:14,504
I knew it!
That whole dentist outfit was a dodge.

646
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:17,171
Look at those clothes.
He's a gunny for sure.

647
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:41,767
Yep, Matthew. That's our man.
We've gotta get rid of him.

648
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:43,772
How you gonna do it?

649
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,435
Simple. I'll have you pick a fight
with him. Gun him down in the street.

650
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:51,640
Now, wait a minute, Reverend.
I ain't gonna tangle with him.

651
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:54,239
What's the matter?
'Fraid he'll kill you?

652
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:57,218
That's part of it. The main
thing is if he nicks me,

653
01:00:57,286 --> 01:01:00,255
why, the scar
will just ruin my looks.

654
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:23,144
I'll get a professional.

655
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:27,180
I hear that Arnold the Kid's in town.

656
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,684
Good!

657
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:33,210
Heck, you're always better off
with a specialist, anyway.

658
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:35,223
Yeah?

659
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:38,590
Well, I'll sure know where to look
if I ever need a coward.

660
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,561
Yep.

661
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:48,535
Arnold, kill Heywood,
I'll give you $600.

662
01:01:51,274 --> 01:01:55,233
All right.
I'll give you $850.

663
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:00,239
<i>All right.
I'll give you $ 1,000.</i>

664
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,676
They told me this outfit
was an original.

665
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,678
Get out of my way.

666
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,680
What?

667
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:34,546
You heard me.
Get out of my way!

668
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:38,346
Well, now. Just who
do you think you are?

669
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:41,689
Arnold the Kid.

670
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:47,519
Doc the Heywood.

671
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:50,599
That name don't scare you?

672
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:57,829
It scares me this much.

673
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:24,024
All right, Mr. Kid.

674
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,125
Now you've gone
just a little bit too far.

675
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:28,170
You're really asking for it.

676
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:31,306
Make your play!

677
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:34,400
I'll make my play.
I'll make my play.

678
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,750
Ippity-doo, kanaba dip,

679
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:44,946
double dare,
knock off the chip!

680
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:46,955
Now, what's this all about?

681
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:49,856
You wanna know what that's all about?
I'll tell you what that's all about.

682
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:53,054
You knock off that chip
and you'll see what it's all about.

683
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:05,198
Uh-huh. Okay.
All right.

684
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:07,538
Okay. I'm gonna tell you
something right now.

685
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:10,704
You just happen to know what I did?
Do you happen to know what I did?

686
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,714
Well, I'll tell you what I did!

687
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:16,115
I killed twelve Indians
and two horses in one fight.

688
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:18,915
Now, how do you like
those bananas?

689
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:25,084
Pass the word to clear the street.

690
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:27,561
I'll meet you here in half an hour.

691
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:34,468
Wear your gun.

692
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:03,562
Hey, I think you might have
something with that Minister Gant.

693
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:05,965
They checked on him back East,
and he ain't no Pentecostal.

694
01:05:06,035 --> 01:05:07,969
And he sure ain't no Mormon.

695
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:11,529
<i>They couldn't find one persuasion
that ever heard tell ofhim.</i>

696
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:14,804
Those Bible boxes
were sure long and heavy.

697
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:18,005
Hey, maybe you and your husband
could scout around the church.

698
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,014
See what's in them boxes.

699
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:23,313
Forget my husband.

700
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:27,550
He's just some Philadelphia jay
I got tied up with to get me out here.

701
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:30,091
The sooner I get rid of him,
the better.

702
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:32,787
Appears to me like
he could be of some help.

703
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:34,989
I hear he's pretty good
with a six-gun.

704
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:24,879
What's going on?

705
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:27,177
That's Heywood
out there practicing.

706
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:29,183
I heard two shots.

707
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:32,980
That means, uh,
he's got four to go.

708
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:32,778
That's six. Call him out.

709
01:07:39,922 --> 01:07:42,152
Heywood!

710
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:46,427
Did you want me for something?

711
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:50,659
It's been exactly a half hour.

712
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:53,395
Mm-hmm.

713
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:28,796
Heywood, I'm even gonna
let you draw first.

714
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:32,407
Thank you.

715
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:46,216
Oooh! Aah!

716
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:54,091
A seven-shooter?

717
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:09,977
Hey! Great! Attaboy!

718
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:15,182
What'd you do that for?

719
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:17,412
I thought you wanted
to get rid of that jay.

720
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:23,124
I don't know.
Something just come over me.

721
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:29,125
Great work, Doc.
You showed them.

722
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:32,099
Atta way, Doc.
Boy, you sure are something.

723
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:37,366
Excuse me.
Excuse me, fellas. Excuse me.

724
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:40,340
Uh, Penny!
Penny!

725
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:43,105
Did you hear about it?
I heard.

726
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,670
'Bout the only thing that saved me
was the old killer instinct.

727
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:47,682
Uh-huh.

728
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:51,311
What about supper? I've got
something to do. I'll see you later.

729
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:54,015
But I ain't seen you all day. Doc
Heywood! The sheriff wants you!

730
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:56,023
Who? The sheriff wants to see you.

731
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:58,525
Just a minute, son. Penny,
look... He says it's important!

732
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:03,861
Well, all right. Where are you
gonna be later? I'll be around.

733
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:06,265
Yeah.

734
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:09,099
Darn women. So excitable.

735
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:13,474
<i>Whenever you're ready, Leonard.</i>

736
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,510
Hold it like that now.

737
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:17,773
That's dandy.

738
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:20,144
Thank you.

739
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:22,684
There. That'll be
a real nice picture for us.

740
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:26,118
The man who got Arnold the Kid. Well.

741
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:28,122
I guess we don't need this anymore.

742
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:30,750
Oh, say. Can I have that? I'd kind
of like to keep it for a souvenir.

743
01:10:30,826 --> 01:10:32,760
Sure, Doc.
Help yourself.

744
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:35,592
Leonard, get that picture
developed as soon as you can.

745
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:37,598
Here, you want me
to give you a hand with this?

746
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:39,600
<i>Yes, please.</i>

747
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:53,177
There we are.

748
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:55,183
Oh. Excuse me.

749
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:09,722
Uh, have you seen
this "ladiola"?

750
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:12,699
<i>Ah, s, si.!
Senora dentista. Aqui.</i>

751
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:14,702
<i>The church?
Aqui.</i>

752
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:16,931
<i>Gracias, senor.</i>

753
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,181
Penny!

754
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:33,448
Hold it!
What's the matter?

755
01:11:33,522 --> 01:11:35,956
Thought I heard
something.

756
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:39,153
<i>Penny!</i>

757
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:09,290
Oooh! Aah!

758
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:29,877
<i>Penny!
Shut up.!</i>

759
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:41,618
Penny!
Keep it quiet!

760
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:45,626
I've been looking
all over town for you.

761
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:48,254
What do you want?

762
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:50,560
Is that you?

763
01:12:50,632 --> 01:12:52,566
Yes, that's me.

764
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:55,034
I'll explain one of these days,
but not right now.

765
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:58,973
I can't believe this!
I just can't...

766
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:01,874
You mean you're a thief? A cattle
rustler? What's this all about?

767
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:05,539
I'll explain it later. Right now
I'm on government business.

768
01:13:05,614 --> 01:13:08,674
Like what? Like stealing rifles
from a nice church?

769
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:10,742
Shhh!

770
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:14,553
It's her. She's the agent. Let's get her.

771
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:17,922
No. Not now. Let's wait till
Doc Heywood ain't here.

772
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:19,927
Come on. Out.

773
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:22,930
It's really none of your business.
Now, let's get out of here.

774
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:32,335
Government business? What kind of
government business? Hold your voice down!

775
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:34,842
But I don't get it.
One minute you're a bank robber,

776
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:36,844
the next minute
you're working for the government.

777
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:39,972
All right. It's true.

778
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:42,573
I am Bad Penny Cushings.

779
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:45,745
But the government said they'd clean
up my record if I did this job for them.

780
01:13:45,821 --> 01:13:47,755
What job?

781
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:49,757
I can't tell you any more.

782
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:56,363
Now, look. I don't know
if you realize it,

783
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,957
but our marriage
is getting pretty shaky.

784
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:01,002
Now, I want to know
what's going on.

785
01:14:01,069 --> 01:14:03,003
All right.

786
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:05,471
Now, can I count on you to
keep this quiet? Of course!

787
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:08,169
Hold your voice down.
Of course.

788
01:14:08,243 --> 01:14:10,177
The government
promised me amnesty...

789
01:14:10,245 --> 01:14:13,510
if I found out who's
smuggling rifles to the Indians.

790
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:15,607
It's Gant and Basch!

791
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:17,675
Gant and Basch?

792
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:19,983
The minister and
his loyal minion?

793
01:14:20,055 --> 01:14:22,990
He's no minister.
And he's no minion.

794
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:38,705
I don't know, Penny.
Everything's just moving too fast.

795
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:41,334
First you came to me
with a toothache; we got married;

796
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:44,402
we got on the wagon train;
bang, bang, bang; hurray, hurray.

797
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,813
Then I found out you're a crook. Then you're
not a crook, you're working with the government.

798
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:50,283
Everything's just moving too fast.

799
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:53,321
<i>Poor little dude.
You're tired, aren't you?</i>

800
01:14:53,388 --> 01:14:55,322
Mm-hmm.

801
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:58,689
<i>Well, I think the best thing to do
is to go to bed.</i>

802
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,694
Huh?

803
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:04,357
<i>I said I think the best thing to do
is to go to bed.</i>

804
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:07,835
Are you changing?

805
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,303
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

806
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,874
I'll just change
in the closet.

807
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:05,793
You can't sleep like that!
Those spurs'll kill me!

808
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:08,159
I've got to get to Fort Tyler
to get the military.

809
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:11,290
But you said...
I mean, I thought that we...

810
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:13,300
Fort Tyler?

811
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:17,464
Don't you understand? If the Indians get
those rifles, they'll wipe out this town.

812
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:19,837
Oh. Yeah.

813
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:23,639
Yeah, well, I better come with you.
I'm pretty handy with a gun, you know.

814
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:27,910
I'm afraid not, dentist. You couldn't
hit a bleeding elephant in the snow.

815
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:29,917
Are you kiddin'?

816
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:33,148
Twelve Indians, two horses
and Arnold the Kid.

817
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:35,155
Look, you might
as well know.

818
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:37,623
I shot the Indians
from inside the wagon.

819
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:40,161
And Arnold the Kid
from the window.

820
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:43,697
What?

821
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:46,165
You mean, I didn't...

822
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:49,726
I mean, none of those...

823
01:16:49,805 --> 01:16:52,740
Nobody?
Nobody.

824
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:00,678
I'm sorry to have
to tell you that, dentist.

825
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:03,081
But I wouldn't want you
to come with me.

826
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:05,085
You might get hurt.

827
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:08,622
Are you coming back?

828
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:11,955
I'm afraid not.
But...

829
01:17:12,027 --> 01:17:14,518
But you're my wife.

830
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:17,990
That was just to get
on the wagon train.

831
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:23,771
I'm sorry.

832
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:33,113
<i>Vaya con Dios, amigo.</i>

833
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:39,453
<i>Gracias.</i>

834
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:48,829
There he is! Hey!

835
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:04,345
Attaboy!
All the way down!

836
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:11,685
Hold it, please.
Just a minute.

837
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:18,290
Uh, there's something that l...

838
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,294
I have to tell you.

839
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:22,296
Come on, Doc.
Speak up.

840
01:18:28,403 --> 01:18:30,337
No. No more.

841
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:37,142
Now, I don't want you to think
that I'm not grateful for the drinks,

842
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:41,046
and for your all being
so nice and everything.

843
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:45,553
But, uh, well, I'm just
gonna tell you straight out.

844
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:54,092
Doc the Heywood,
the well-known Indian fighter,

845
01:18:54,162 --> 01:18:56,630
is a fake.

846
01:18:57,766 --> 01:19:01,167
It's true! It is absolutely true!

847
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:05,263
Just as long as I'm standing here,
right here, right now. It's the truth.

848
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:07,535
Well, Doc, somebody
killed them dozen Indians.

849
01:19:07,609 --> 01:19:09,543
Now, who killed 'em?

850
01:19:10,712 --> 01:19:12,805
My wife.

851
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:15,873
<i>Just a second.!</i>

852
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:18,784
Just a second.
Hold 'er up.

853
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:22,415
You got the Kid because
we all seen it. Right!

854
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:26,621
You got him... zang! With one
shot while you was a-fallin' down!

855
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:28,629
That's right!
Clean shot!

856
01:19:28,697 --> 01:19:30,631
My wife got him
from a window.

857
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:34,965
I wasted all my shots like a
darned dumbbell! Don't you remember?

858
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:39,997
I shot two at the can,

859
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:42,373
two at the sign,

860
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:44,469
one at the skillet...

861
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:49,007
and one in the pants.

862
01:19:51,419 --> 01:19:53,580
All right now!
Hold it! Hold it!

863
01:19:53,655 --> 01:19:57,056
I was watchin' the whole thing.
Now, let's see. There was, uh,

864
01:19:57,125 --> 01:20:00,219
there was two at the can,

865
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:02,456
two at the sign,

866
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:06,126
one at the skillet...

867
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:08,431
and one in the pants.

868
01:20:08,503 --> 01:20:10,630
Two in the can,

869
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:13,970
two at the sign,
one at the skillet...

870
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:17,375
and one in the pants.

871
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:55,138
Oh! Oh!
Help! Aaah!

872
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:58,652
Failure, failure, failure.

873
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:02,087
failure, failure,
failure, failure.

874
01:21:02,157 --> 01:21:05,285
That's the story
of my life, you know.

875
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:10,229
Two things have always
been my downfall.

876
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:14,496
I have always been...

877
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:17,663
the most failure
of anybody,

878
01:21:17,739 --> 01:21:21,175
and I'm too thin.

879
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:23,734
I don't think you're too thin.

880
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:27,441
It's all bloat.

881
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:31,076
Bloated thin failure!
That's me!

882
01:21:31,152 --> 01:21:33,882
I think you're wonderful.

883
01:21:33,955 --> 01:21:36,549
I just love a man
that can't make his...

884
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:38,559
mark in life.

885
01:21:40,762 --> 01:21:45,790
Penny, hmm. Penny, she's
really somethin', you know that?

886
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:48,563
Mmm-mm.
Mmm.

887
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:50,571
And she used me.

888
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:54,336
And she... she tricked me.

889
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:57,173
She made me think...

890
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:59,213
that she loved me.

891
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:01,613
Aww.

892
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:05,552
I should've known better.

893
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:10,190
Nobody ever loved me.

894
01:22:12,027 --> 01:22:16,828
Did you know I had to take my own
cousin to the graduation dance?

895
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:19,924
Awww.

896
01:22:22,137 --> 01:22:24,298
I threw up on her dress.

897
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:28,809
You are really my kind of guy.

898
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:42,185
I got on a romance track.

899
01:22:42,257 --> 01:22:45,192
Then I got
on a gunslinger's track.

900
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:49,563
I gotta get back
on that dentist's track.

901
01:22:52,767 --> 01:22:55,235
Go ahead. Laugh!

902
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:57,999
Laugh all you like.

903
01:22:58,073 --> 01:23:00,132
I'm not a failure.

904
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:02,699
I'm a dentist!

905
01:23:02,777 --> 01:23:05,541
A real dentist.

906
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:09,777
And I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

907
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:14,914
I'm gonna spread dental health
through the West like a plague!

908
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:19,626
Come on. I wanna close up.

909
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:28,769
Good night, Doc.

910
01:23:33,942 --> 01:23:37,878
Brush your dentist twice a day.
Visit your toothbrush once a year.

911
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:58,355
Hyah!

912
01:23:58,433 --> 01:24:01,197
<i>Penny.!</i>

913
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:03,203
Penny!

914
01:24:07,442 --> 01:24:09,376
Penny! Pen...

915
01:24:56,324 --> 01:24:58,258
Water.

916
01:25:19,747 --> 01:25:24,151
Uh!

917
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:35,290
Water. Water.

918
01:25:35,363 --> 01:25:38,025
I gotta have water. l...

919
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:08,795
Water. I gotta have water.

920
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:26,470
Uh! Air! I gotta have air!

921
01:26:26,548 --> 01:26:28,482
Air!

922
01:29:14,082 --> 01:29:16,016
Penny! Penny!

923
01:29:18,086 --> 01:29:21,021
<i>Watay. Watay.!</i>

924
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:28,295
<i>Watay.</i>

925
01:29:38,106 --> 01:29:41,337
<i>Watay. Watay.</i>

926
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:46,046
<i>Watay.</i>

927
01:29:51,185 --> 01:29:53,119
How many did we give out?

928
01:29:53,187 --> 01:29:56,054
That tallies 181.

929
01:30:05,333 --> 01:30:07,801
That girl. I think I know her.

930
01:30:07,869 --> 01:30:09,803
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

931
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:12,465
Isn't that
Laughing Deer's daughter?

932
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:16,306
No. The Deer girl
married White Antelope.

933
01:30:16,377 --> 01:30:20,438
Rotten Buffalo's cousin? Ohhh!

934
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:29,356
<i>Ah wan no.</i>

935
01:30:40,902 --> 01:30:44,303
<i>Ah wan no.</i>

936
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:49,933
<i>Watay.</i>

937
01:30:51,879 --> 01:30:53,813
<i>Watay?</i>

938
01:31:47,535 --> 01:31:51,335
<i>Ah. Ah. Watay?</i>

939
01:31:51,405 --> 01:31:53,839
<i>Watay?
Uh-huh watay.!</i>

940
01:32:02,216 --> 01:32:04,946
Dentist, you're crazy!
Are you all right?

941
01:32:05,019 --> 01:32:08,318
Except for these bindings.
They're killing my hands.

942
01:32:08,389 --> 01:32:11,722
I figure the best time to get out
is after they all get a little drunker.

943
01:32:11,792 --> 01:32:13,726
You know something?

944
01:32:13,794 --> 01:32:16,354
You're a lot spunkier
than I thought you were.

945
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:18,864
I get that
from my mother.

946
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:28,574
<i>Sat tey wahn ney.!</i>

947
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:36,612
He's crazy about me.

948
01:32:36,684 --> 01:32:38,618
<i>Sat tey wahn ney.!</i>

949
01:32:38,686 --> 01:32:40,711
Looks like we're going dancing.

950
01:34:38,439 --> 01:34:42,307
Here. We're gonna need
this when we make our break.

951
01:34:42,376 --> 01:34:44,310
Be careful.

952
01:34:58,893 --> 01:35:01,987
Put me down!

953
01:35:27,354 --> 01:35:29,288
Reverend.
Minion.

954
01:35:30,357 --> 01:35:34,225
Well, now.
If it ain't Doc Heywood,

955
01:35:34,295 --> 01:35:36,786
gunfighter.

956
01:35:40,301 --> 01:35:42,929
Phony gunfighter.

957
01:35:44,805 --> 01:35:48,605
Say, Doc. How 'bout us
havin' a real gunfight, huh?

958
01:35:48,676 --> 01:35:53,136
And to make it even, it'll be just you
against me and the good Reverend here.

959
01:35:53,214 --> 01:35:56,581
Now, uh, what do you
think about that?

960
01:35:57,818 --> 01:36:00,150
You wanna know
what I think about that?

961
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:03,156
Well, I'll just show you
what I think about that.

962
01:36:07,061 --> 01:36:09,996
Well.

963
01:36:23,577 --> 01:36:25,807
Put it on, Heywood.

964
01:36:51,605 --> 01:36:53,596
Anytime you're ready,
Heywood.

965
01:37:05,886 --> 01:37:07,820
We've got horses right back
there, Penny. Let's go.

966
01:37:07,888 --> 01:37:10,516
<i>Let me go!
Jesse's out there.</i>

967
01:37:10,591 --> 01:37:12,525
Oh, Jesse!

968
01:37:14,829 --> 01:37:16,763
Let's go.

969
01:37:41,055 --> 01:37:43,421
<i>Watay?</i>

970
01:37:51,232 --> 01:37:53,359
Rider coming in!

971
01:38:03,644 --> 01:38:05,578
Get ready.
They're comin'!

972
01:38:05,646 --> 01:38:09,673
Get the women and the kids back into
the church. Get back in the church!

973
01:38:21,996 --> 01:38:25,727
Well, they're sure takin'
their sweet time about it.

974
01:38:25,799 --> 01:38:27,733
Devils!
Hold it.

975
01:38:35,609 --> 01:38:37,440
What the...

976
01:38:40,681 --> 01:38:44,117
Doc Heywood's with 'em.
He sure is.

977
01:38:44,184 --> 01:38:46,584
Open up, boys.
Everything's under control.

978
01:38:49,623 --> 01:38:51,557
Jesse! You're alive!

979
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:53,559
Yeah! I know.

980
01:38:56,730 --> 01:39:00,427
Take my friend Black Eagle
and fix him up with a big rare steak!

981
01:39:04,605 --> 01:39:07,938
Adjustments are free up to 60 days.
After that, it's a dollar a visit.

982
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:14,413
I'm so glad you're back.

983
01:39:14,481 --> 01:39:16,415
Me too!

984
01:39:34,601 --> 01:39:36,535
Oh, come on, now.

985
01:39:36,603 --> 01:39:39,766
Come... Come on!
Wait a minute! Wait...
