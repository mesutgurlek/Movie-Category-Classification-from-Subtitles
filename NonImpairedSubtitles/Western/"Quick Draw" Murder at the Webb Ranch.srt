1
00:00:04,625 --> 00:00:08,394
I am so sorry for your loss, Mrs. Webb.

2
00:00:08,395 --> 00:00:12,398
To know that just a day ago, this...

3
00:00:12,399 --> 00:00:16,302
bag of blood and guts
was walking around

4
00:00:16,303 --> 00:00:18,337
and feeding chickens and...

5
00:00:18,338 --> 00:00:20,473
hugging you, and...

6
00:00:20,474 --> 00:00:23,476
This must be very difficult.

7
00:00:23,477 --> 00:00:25,211
And I want you to know,

8
00:00:25,212 --> 00:00:29,115
uh, heh, I attended Harvard University.

9
00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:31,651
I studied Criminology and Forensics.

10
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:36,056
I graduated number 327 in my class.

11
00:00:36,356 --> 00:00:40,359
And I will use everything I learned

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,362
to determine how he died,

13
00:00:43,363 --> 00:00:46,265
where he died,
because don't assume this is it,

14
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:49,602
and most importantly,
who did it and why they did it

15
00:00:49,603 --> 00:00:52,405
- and where they were when they did it.
- I know what happened.

16
00:00:52,406 --> 00:00:54,607
I can tell you what happened.

17
00:00:54,608 --> 00:00:58,377
And I can tell that you think
you know what happened.

18
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:01,647
Well, she knows what happened. She
know... She can tell us what happened.

19
00:01:01,648 --> 00:01:05,451
I don't want to know what she thinks
"she saw" happen.

20
00:01:05,452 --> 00:01:09,990
I want science to tell me
what actually happened.

21
00:01:10,057 --> 00:01:12,258
That's why I went to Harvard.
Not to just ask me:

22
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:14,594
"What happened? What happened?
What...?" No!

23
00:01:14,595 --> 00:01:18,531
We don't know. She might be crazy.
She might be an idiot.

24
00:01:18,532 --> 00:01:21,300
My husband is dead
and you're calling me an idiot!

25
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:24,036
We don't even know
that this is your husband yet.

26
00:01:24,037 --> 00:01:27,173
- It is my husband!
- So you say!

27
00:01:27,174 --> 00:01:30,076
Now let me see, okay?

28
00:01:30,077 --> 00:01:32,445
Now, we don't even know if it's a man.

29
00:01:32,446 --> 00:01:35,015
So let's check that out first.

30
00:01:35,082 --> 00:01:36,783
Okay, that's a man.

31
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,618
That's... That's definitely a man.

32
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:42,955
And I think we're gonna have to say
that he is in fact definitely dead.

33
00:01:42,956 --> 00:01:45,558
Especially with this...
Oh, the hand just came off.

34
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:48,661
That just came right off. See that?

35
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,035
All right, so I'm gonna go
with my presentation now.

36
00:01:56,036 --> 00:01:58,404
This man... He has a penis.

37
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:00,573
Who was married... He has a ring.

38
00:02:00,574 --> 00:02:04,377
Was dragged, I'm gonna guess
by the drag pattern,

39
00:02:04,378 --> 00:02:06,579
from that house, which we will
have to go over and canvass.

40
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,414
- We'll see who lives there.
- It's my house.

41
00:02:08,415 --> 00:02:10,449
- Good, okay, this is...
- It's a nice house.

42
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:14,420
And then he was tied up
and left out here in the wilderness

43
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:17,490
and was devoured
by some wild creature.

44
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:20,159
I'm gonna go with,
based on these tracks,

45
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,928
coyotes.

46
00:02:22,963 --> 00:02:25,131
And you can tell by the maggot.

47
00:02:25,132 --> 00:02:26,666
Do you see this maggot here?

48
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:28,267
You see that?

49
00:02:28,268 --> 00:02:32,138
That's a second pupae stage. That means
it's been about a day and a half.

50
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:34,407
If I had a watch,
I would pronounce him dead right now.

51
00:02:34,408 --> 00:02:36,643
His feet are gone.

52
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,078
I'm now ready to hear

53
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:41,047
your eyewitness account.

54
00:02:44,217 --> 00:02:47,019
Cole Younger and his gang
came out to the ranch

55
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,654
and Cole and I were...

56
00:02:48,655 --> 00:02:51,491
- having relations.
- Sexual relations.

57
00:02:51,892 --> 00:02:53,926
- Yes.
- Okay.

58
00:02:53,927 --> 00:02:55,061
See, that's important.

59
00:02:55,062 --> 00:02:57,129
And my husband came home
in the middle of it.

60
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,466
And so him and his gang
dragged my husband out to this tree

61
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:03,536
and they tied him to it,
and then they set the dogs on him.

62
00:03:03,537 --> 00:03:06,405
That's exactly what I said.

63
00:03:06,406 --> 00:03:09,342
- Exactly.
- It is. He got it pretty much right on.

64
00:03:09,343 --> 00:03:11,544
That's... That's Harvard.

65
00:03:12,446 --> 00:03:14,647
Great Bend has had how many sheriffs?

66
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:17,316
- Five. Well, six with you.
- Okay.

67
00:03:17,317 --> 00:03:19,218
And of the five,

68
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:21,554
- what happened to all of them?
- They all died.

69
00:03:21,555 --> 00:03:23,122
- They all died. Okay.
- Yeah.

70
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:24,657
And of natural causes?

71
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:27,460
No, unnatural causes, all.

72
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:29,562
So all five sheriffs were murdered,

73
00:03:29,563 --> 00:03:32,298
and yet you were their deputy
and you survived.

74
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:34,634
- Yeah.
- Okay... Um...

75
00:03:34,635 --> 00:03:37,103
Can you guess my next question?

76
00:03:44,011 --> 00:03:46,412
Oh, hello, Miss Shaw.

77
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:48,180
Sheriff Hoyle, you're back again.

78
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:51,050
- Yeah!
- Wanna go upstairs for intercourse?

79
00:03:51,051 --> 00:03:54,387
No. Well, maybe later.
I'll have one of your drink specials.

80
00:03:54,388 --> 00:03:56,623
Give me the whiskey skin.

81
00:03:57,424 --> 00:03:59,759
Thank you.

82
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,061
Tangy, right?

83
00:04:04,231 --> 00:04:07,634
It's... It's good to wet my whistle,
and, uh...

84
00:04:08,035 --> 00:04:10,936
replenish my constitution after

85
00:04:10,937 --> 00:04:13,606
this heinous murder scene I was, uh...

86
00:04:13,607 --> 00:04:16,208
Oh, yeah. I heard about that murder.
Up at the Webb place.

87
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:19,045
Yeah, yeah, Mr. Webb met with

88
00:04:19,046 --> 00:04:21,514
- a unseemly death.
- Oh, wow.

89
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:23,582
But as a lawman,
this is the kind of thing that I...

90
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,551
- You must see it every day.
- All the time.

91
00:04:25,552 --> 00:04:29,121
I mean, this was the first actual,
you know,

92
00:04:29,122 --> 00:04:32,458
dead body that I've... That I've seen

93
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:34,928
that wasn't in an autopsy class, so...

94
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:38,031
Would you excuse me for a second?

95
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:50,242
- What's that?
- Oh, I had to change

96
00:04:50,243 --> 00:04:53,045
the Sheriff Death Pool.
Everybody in town has odds

97
00:04:53,046 --> 00:04:54,680
on how long you're gonna make it.

98
00:04:54,681 --> 00:04:57,316
The whole town? Everybody here
is betting on when I'm gonna die?

99
00:04:57,317 --> 00:04:59,885
- Yup.
- Excuse me, everybody?

100
00:04:59,886 --> 00:05:02,254
Could I have your attention, please?

101
00:05:02,255 --> 00:05:05,024
I have just learned
about the Sheriff Death Pool

102
00:05:05,025 --> 00:05:09,995
and I just want to share,
if I may, my opinion of it.

103
00:05:09,996 --> 00:05:12,431
I find it very hurtful.

104
00:05:12,432 --> 00:05:16,569
I mean, this is a human being that
came all the way out here to help who?

105
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,972
You! Help you.

106
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:21,674
And how do you repay me?

107
00:05:21,675 --> 00:05:25,344
You know what?
I think I've had enough of my whiskey...

108
00:05:25,345 --> 00:05:27,346
- skin.
- Are you sure?

109
00:05:27,347 --> 00:05:29,915
Yes! And the rest of you,

110
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:33,052
you can forget about the barbecue
at my place on Sunday.

111
00:05:33,053 --> 00:05:35,054
No one was coming to your barbecue.

112
00:05:35,055 --> 00:05:39,058
There were a lot of maybes.
A lot of maybes!

113
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:42,094
Miss Shaw, I will see you at 8 a.m.

114
00:05:42,095 --> 00:05:44,030
for my morning intercourse.

115
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:49,167
All right, Mr. Shank, now...

116
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:51,803
What we have here is a murder victim.

117
00:05:51,804 --> 00:05:55,140
Or at least that's what we're...
We're going with so far.

118
00:05:55,141 --> 00:05:58,077
This is Mr. Webb.

119
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:01,713
And according to evidence
gathered on the scene,

120
00:06:01,714 --> 00:06:03,982
he was murdered by Cole Younger.

121
00:06:03,983 --> 00:06:05,884
Good, so we should put him in a box,

122
00:06:05,885 --> 00:06:07,786
put it in the ground, call it a day.

123
00:06:07,787 --> 00:06:09,621
No, no. That's, see...

124
00:06:09,622 --> 00:06:13,725
Maybe I haven't... I don't know if you know
this, but I attended Harvard University.

125
00:06:13,726 --> 00:06:15,894
- I heard.
- Okay, you did? All right.

126
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:18,497
And there I studied

127
00:06:18,498 --> 00:06:20,932
Criminal Science. Forensics.

128
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:23,001
Criminology. Phrenology.

129
00:06:23,002 --> 00:06:25,771
You don't know any of these things.
These are like, "What? What?"

130
00:06:25,772 --> 00:06:27,439
- Autopsy.
- Okay.

131
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,808
This is going to affect your life deeply.

132
00:06:29,809 --> 00:06:32,878
You are no longer the undertaker
of Great Bend, Kansas.

133
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:35,047
You are now the medical examiner.

134
00:06:35,048 --> 00:06:36,682
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes!

135
00:06:36,683 --> 00:06:39,785
I like being the undertaker.
It's a very good fit.

136
00:06:39,786 --> 00:06:42,054
I'm telling you, when you tell people
you're an undertaker,

137
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:44,756
you don't see this, but as they walk away,
they're all, like, "Ugh."

138
00:06:44,757 --> 00:06:47,993
- Really?
- Yes, you're with dead people all the time.

139
00:06:47,994 --> 00:06:51,063
But a medical examiner. Oh, Mr. Shank.

140
00:06:51,064 --> 00:06:53,365
People like medical examiners.

141
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:56,134
- Women too?
- Yes. Yes.

142
00:06:56,135 --> 00:06:57,869
- Well, tell me how to do it.
- Okay.

143
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,138
Now do you see this bulbous area
right here?

144
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:02,107
- See that thing I'm pushing on?
- Yes, I do.

145
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:05,110
You can't really see it. Just put
your finger there. Do you feel that?

146
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:08,113
That's... Wait. No, that's a testicle
that got pushed up.

147
00:07:08,114 --> 00:07:10,549
- Right there. You feel that?
- Yeah, that feels different.

148
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,685
Okay, that's the stomach,
and we can fish around with a...

149
00:07:13,686 --> 00:07:17,723
Uh-oh. Everybody, get happy!

150
00:07:17,724 --> 00:07:19,791
- I found something.
- Don't.

151
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:22,995
Okay, this is not gross. This is gold.

152
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:28,467
- Oh!
- Okay. Just what I thought.

153
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:30,469
This is a Ben Davis apple.

154
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,704
Ring any bells, deputy?

155
00:07:32,705 --> 00:07:34,840
- Don't ask me...
- Abilene Railroad

156
00:07:34,841 --> 00:07:39,778
was recently robbed, and a shipment
of Ben Davis apples were stolen.

157
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:42,714
The deputy and I tracked it
to an abandoned ranch

158
00:07:42,715 --> 00:07:45,684
and we found some Ben Davis apples.

159
00:07:45,685 --> 00:07:49,755
Now I'm thinking, no,
that abandoned ranch is where...

160
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:52,557
Cole Younger is hiding out!

161
00:07:52,558 --> 00:07:55,894
Wait, I... I missed a step.
How does Cole Younger...?

162
00:07:55,895 --> 00:07:57,596
- Get an apple in his stomach?
- Yeah.

163
00:07:57,597 --> 00:08:00,132
All right. Mr. Webb was tied to the tree.

164
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:01,733
And the wolves are eating.

165
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:04,970
"Aah!" He's screaming, right?
What is he doing? "Aah!"

166
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:06,571
How do you shut him up?

167
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:09,641
You shove something in his mouth.
What's in your pocket?

168
00:08:09,642 --> 00:08:11,910
- A Ben Davis apple.
- Ben Davis apple. I'm telling you.

169
00:08:11,911 --> 00:08:14,813
That abandoned ranch
was Cole Younger's hideout.

170
00:08:14,814 --> 00:08:16,782
That's where we're gonna find him.
Okay.

171
00:08:16,783 --> 00:08:18,984
Mr. Shank, I wanna leave the body here.

172
00:08:18,985 --> 00:08:21,486
This is evidence,
I'm gonna need it later for the trial.

173
00:08:21,487 --> 00:08:24,489
Well, I can't. I need to move the body
before tonight.

174
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,558
I'm having an open house.

175
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:29,094
You're the only undertaker in town.
Why would you have an open house?

176
00:08:29,095 --> 00:08:31,430
Trying to inspire people to pre-register.

177
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:34,066
Okay, put a sheet over it or something.
Save it.

178
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,135
When I think about it,
sheriff, I think maybe...

179
00:08:45,136 --> 00:08:49,906
Maybe you should be the posse
and I should go guard the widow Webb.

180
00:08:49,907 --> 00:08:52,442
Are you just wanting to have sex
with the widow Webb?

181
00:08:52,443 --> 00:08:55,712
Yeah, she's a real... A WILF.

182
00:08:55,713 --> 00:08:58,315
- A WILF?
- A widow I'd like to fornicate with.

183
00:08:58,316 --> 00:09:00,250
- I messed that up.
- The W at the end is silent?

184
00:09:00,251 --> 00:09:02,452
- Yeah, I threw another...
- No, no, it'll work.

185
00:09:02,453 --> 00:09:07,124
Eli, there is nothing more I'd like to see
than you and the widow Webb having sex.

186
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:10,727
The point is is that I'm gonna need help
taking down Cole Younger.

187
00:09:10,728 --> 00:09:15,098
Now, I know you're probably concerned
because we don't have a posse.

188
00:09:15,099 --> 00:09:18,735
But I'm telling you,
with my Harvard-trained techniques

189
00:09:18,736 --> 00:09:23,140
in guerrilla strategy, we can slip in
and take them all out.

190
00:09:23,141 --> 00:09:26,143
See, I was gonna ask
if that was the ears on the wall.

191
00:09:26,144 --> 00:09:28,211
Yes! Yes, you noticed.

192
00:09:28,212 --> 00:09:32,382
- I did.
- These are anthropometry ear drawings.

193
00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:36,153
By exploring certain facial features, we,

194
00:09:36,154 --> 00:09:37,921
the men of science,

195
00:09:37,922 --> 00:09:41,291
can decide whether somebody
is inclined to be a criminal

196
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:43,894
- or a citizen.
- How would you know with me?

197
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:48,231
There's a brow feature that you have
that shows some...

198
00:09:48,232 --> 00:09:51,268
That you're probably criminally inclined.

199
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:53,470
I'm not sure that I'm comfortable

200
00:09:53,471 --> 00:09:57,073
with me riding out with you
with the possibility that at any moment,

201
00:09:57,074 --> 00:09:59,376
I might murder you
or become criminally insane.

202
00:09:59,377 --> 00:10:02,312
I'll risk it. No matter how
our brows are shaped,

203
00:10:02,313 --> 00:10:04,681
- we still have free will.
- Okay.

204
00:10:04,682 --> 00:10:06,416
Let's go kill a whole lot
of human beings.

205
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:09,286
- Yeah, let's do that.
- All right!

206
00:10:09,287 --> 00:10:13,156
That's the thing about Cole Younger,
though, is he wears a mask.

207
00:10:13,157 --> 00:10:16,326
I know, I've heard, I've heard.
I've seen pictures and accounts.

208
00:10:16,327 --> 00:10:20,197
They say you can see the dark parts
of your soul inside of his mask.

209
00:10:20,198 --> 00:10:21,865
No, you can't.

210
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:24,267
It's possible that he is a demon

211
00:10:24,268 --> 00:10:26,770
created at the earth's onset.

212
00:10:26,771 --> 00:10:28,839
- What?
- Or something else.

213
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,107
Maybe he just doesn't want people
to know who he is.

214
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:33,577
You ever think about that?

215
00:10:39,183 --> 00:10:41,184
Wah, wah, wah.

216
00:10:41,185 --> 00:10:43,086
- There we go, Vernon.
- Okay.

217
00:10:43,087 --> 00:10:46,256
- Cough it up.
- It seemed like a solid bet at the time.

218
00:10:46,257 --> 00:10:49,125
You always think your bets are solid,
but they never quite are.

219
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:50,694
Well this one was. I mean,

220
00:10:50,695 --> 00:10:53,129
he practically hurt himself
putting on his holster this morning.

221
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,199
- Oh. Yeah, I suppose.
- I'm gonna go again.

222
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,936
Tuesday or Wednesday.

223
00:10:59,103 --> 00:11:01,872
Look, Vernon, I'm gonna give you
some inside information.

224
00:11:01,873 --> 00:11:04,875
- Okay.
- Hoyle is out there now.

225
00:11:04,876 --> 00:11:07,210
Looking for Cole Younger.

226
00:11:07,211 --> 00:11:09,946
- You know that?
- You've talked me into it.

227
00:11:09,947 --> 00:11:12,148
Let's do two... Let's do two on...

228
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:14,952
- Give me two on Tuesday.
- Okay, good.

229
00:11:15,953 --> 00:11:18,288
I feel confident.

230
00:11:25,897 --> 00:11:27,598
Okay.

231
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,968
- Okay, there it is. There it is.
- I see it.

232
00:11:31,969 --> 00:11:33,470
That's where
we found the apples, right?

233
00:11:33,471 --> 00:11:35,472
- Right.
- Okay. So.

234
00:11:35,473 --> 00:11:38,208
Once we get ourselves gathered,

235
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:40,677
we're gonna go in there
and we're gonna take them out, okay?

236
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:42,379
When we're both in position,
if I go like this:

237
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,681
It means, "Look at what I'm looking at."

238
00:11:44,682 --> 00:11:46,683
- Maybe we should get a posse.
- What?

239
00:11:46,684 --> 00:11:49,319
I'm not riding three days back,
try to get a posse,

240
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,690
then three days...
Everything out here is three days' ride.

241
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:57,027
It's like, I'm so chafed. I will show
you later. I'll take my pants off.

242
00:11:57,028 --> 00:11:59,362
You will see, because I have eczema.

243
00:11:59,363 --> 00:12:01,698
And it just exacerbates it.

244
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:04,801
I understand where you're coming from,
I'm just saying there's two of us

245
00:12:04,802 --> 00:12:07,337
- and probably more of them.
- I know you're nervous.

246
00:12:07,338 --> 00:12:09,973
I know. Look, I'm nervous for you.

247
00:12:09,974 --> 00:12:12,075
- I'm nervous for me.
- But we have this.

248
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:13,811
We have the art of surprise.

249
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,713
Jesus. Watch out!

250
00:12:16,714 --> 00:12:18,682
- Oh!
- Those are guns!

251
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,851
Jesus Christ.

252
00:12:21,752 --> 00:12:25,656
We've been ambushed. All right, I couldn't
see how many there were, could you?

253
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,391
God! What are you...?

254
00:12:28,392 --> 00:12:31,428
Eli, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

255
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:34,431
Come here, come here.
Okay, okay, get down.

256
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:36,066
Who taught you how to shoot like that?

257
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:38,101
Well, I just know it naturally.

258
00:12:38,102 --> 00:12:41,004
You're not hitting anything.
You line up the little metal... Aah.

259
00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:43,707
The metal thing.
See the little thing on the end here?

260
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:47,711
You line that up between,
you don't just shoot willy-nilly.

261
00:12:47,912 --> 00:12:50,113
- I got this, okay?
- You got what?

262
00:12:50,114 --> 00:12:51,448
Yeah, I'm taking care of it.

263
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:53,817
I got a B-plus at the Harvard Gun Club.

264
00:12:53,818 --> 00:12:55,419
Oh, sheriff.

265
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:10,900
You got a B-plus?

266
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:14,204
Yeah, well, it's Harvard, so a B-plus is

267
00:13:14,205 --> 00:13:16,940
hard to get, okay?

268
00:13:16,941 --> 00:13:20,043
- Who got the A's?
- Oh, Laozi, he was this

269
00:13:20,044 --> 00:13:22,212
Chinese boy.

270
00:13:22,213 --> 00:13:24,314
They start them really early.

271
00:13:24,315 --> 00:13:27,350
Shot his mother's earlobe off
when he was like 2.

272
00:13:27,351 --> 00:13:29,085
Brutal.

273
00:13:29,086 --> 00:13:30,453
- It's very... What?
- One more!

274
00:13:30,454 --> 00:13:32,689
- A fellow over there!
- Hold it!

275
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,058
I surrender! I surrender!

276
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:38,428
Okay, put your gun down. Put it down.

277
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:41,164
Wait, that's too close.
Put it a little bit...

278
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:43,133
All right... Wait! Don't touch it!
Don't touch it!

279
00:13:43,134 --> 00:13:46,169
- I'm not touching it.
- Okay, you move away from the gun, then.

280
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,937
Kick it away from you
before you move away.

281
00:13:47,938 --> 00:13:50,206
I'll have to approach the gun
to kick it away. Is that...?

282
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,675
Okay! Approach the gun!
Don't pick it up!

283
00:13:52,676 --> 00:13:54,911
Don't even look at it! Who is he?

284
00:13:54,912 --> 00:13:57,213
This is Ephraim Younger,
it's Cole's brother.

285
00:13:57,214 --> 00:14:00,617
- Hey, Ephraim, it's Eli.
- Oh, hey, Eli.

286
00:14:00,684 --> 00:14:02,218
- Eli.
- Yeah.

287
00:14:02,219 --> 00:14:05,388
- Come to the river. Slow and easy like.
- All right.

288
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:07,757
- Watch out.
- Oh, this... This is not...

289
00:14:07,758 --> 00:14:10,727
- There's no path there.
- I wouldn't go there. There's snakes.

290
00:14:10,728 --> 00:14:13,296
- I'm gonna come around this way.
- Yes! Take the path.

291
00:14:13,297 --> 00:14:14,898
Watch out for ticks.

292
00:14:26,475 --> 00:14:28,944
Oof.

293
00:14:28,977 --> 00:14:32,146
- Sorry, Vernon.
- Are you really?

294
00:14:32,147 --> 00:14:34,082
A little bit.

295
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,451
I have not had a run this bad since...

296
00:14:36,452 --> 00:14:39,287
- Since the last sheriff.
- Since the last time we did it.

297
00:14:39,288 --> 00:14:42,023
Let me ask you
just a point of clarification.

298
00:14:42,024 --> 00:14:45,193
If he were to get bit

299
00:14:45,194 --> 00:14:47,528
- by something or stung by something,
- Mm-hm.

300
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:52,333
But it takes a period of time
for the venom to kick in and kill him,

301
00:14:52,334 --> 00:14:55,603
- is the winning...?
- No it's actual TOD, time of death.

302
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:58,206
Not TO... Not time of bite.

303
00:14:58,207 --> 00:15:02,310
I just needed to check. Let's do 10 on...

304
00:15:02,311 --> 00:15:04,245
- So?
- Ten on Friday.

305
00:15:04,246 --> 00:15:05,546
- Yup, yup, yup.
- All right?

306
00:15:05,547 --> 00:15:07,648
I feel like I'm getting better at this,
don't you?

307
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:09,818
I think so, Vernon.

308
00:15:10,986 --> 00:15:13,555
She seems not genuine.

309
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:17,158
Ephraim, where is your brother?
That's what I'd like to know.

310
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:19,427
He was out robbing a stage, Hoyle.

311
00:15:19,428 --> 00:15:20,595
What, just by himself?

312
00:15:20,596 --> 00:15:22,663
Yeah, sometimes he don't need backup.

313
00:15:22,664 --> 00:15:25,199
- Cole's his own army.
- Wait.

314
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,301
Sometimes he says, "Hey, everybody,

315
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:30,238
I'll be back in a little bit.
I'm gonna go rob a stagecoach."

316
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:33,341
No, he leaves a note. It's
common courtesy, Hoyle, to leave a note.

317
00:15:33,342 --> 00:15:35,209
I leave notes.

318
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,511
- Hey, Hoyle.
- Yeah?

319
00:15:36,512 --> 00:15:38,980
- My brother's gonna kill you.
- Oh, my God.

320
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:42,016
Do you like having insides?
Because those are gonna be outsides.

321
00:15:42,017 --> 00:15:45,553
You know, Ephraim,
you've been saying the same thing

322
00:15:45,554 --> 00:15:47,722
over and over.

323
00:15:49,558 --> 00:15:51,492
One whiskey skin.

324
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:54,228
You sure you should be drinking
on the job, Hoyle?

325
00:15:54,229 --> 00:15:57,098
I'll just have a sip. I just...
I wanted to come in

326
00:15:57,099 --> 00:15:58,699
and, you know, talk a bit.

327
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,284
I really appreciate
what you've done for this town.

328
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,670
- Really?
- No.

329
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:05,606
Listen, I think you're doing
a real dumb thing here.

330
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:08,209
Putting Ephraim Younger in jail.

331
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,511
He was involved in a crime
and he will do his time.

332
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:13,448
You know who's gonna be
doing their time now? Everyone.

333
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:17,285
Because Cole Younger is
a bad, bad boy.

334
00:16:17,286 --> 00:16:19,687
I mean, we're talking a real curly wolf.

335
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:23,491
He's gonna bust him out, kill you,
probably kill a few other people.

336
00:16:23,492 --> 00:16:28,362
And then he is gonna take me upstairs
and bed me with such force

337
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:31,532
and such gusto that you'll
probably feel it in your grave.

338
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:34,569
So you should probably enjoy that drink.

339
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,205
Well, if today's my last day,

340
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:40,041
then may I propose something.

341
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:43,444
If I survive, how would you like to

342
00:16:43,445 --> 00:16:46,214
go out on a date with me? Off the clock.

343
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:49,451
You know, just the two of us.
Just, you know, people.

344
00:16:49,485 --> 00:16:53,154
Maybe go up, take a picnic
up to the hanging tree.

345
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:56,624
- Are you trying to dicker with me, Hoyle?
- What does that mean, dicker?

346
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,327
- Are you trying to barter services with me?
- No!

347
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:01,162
Because I don't barter,
it's strictly money.

348
00:17:01,163 --> 00:17:03,397
No, no, I don't want...
I don't wanna have sex.

349
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:06,434
- Mm-hm.
- I would very much like to get to know

350
00:17:06,435 --> 00:17:08,202
not just the vagina,

351
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:10,538
but the heart and the brain

352
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:13,174
- of you.
- I have been with a lot of men, Hoyle.

353
00:17:13,175 --> 00:17:15,376
You are the most like a woman

354
00:17:15,377 --> 00:17:18,480
- I have ever been with.
- I'll take that as a compliment.

355
00:17:20,215 --> 00:17:24,919
Sheriff, Cole Younger's outside
and he's calling for you.

356
00:17:25,687 --> 00:17:27,455
Okay, thank you, deputy.

357
00:17:27,456 --> 00:17:29,991
I'll take care of this by myself.

358
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,494
Nice talking to you, Hoyle.

359
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:35,530
Miss Shaw, you just get ready
for that picnic.

360
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:25,980
You're gonna die, sheriff!
My brother's gonna kill you!

361
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:29,684
And then he's gonna kill you
a second time, just so you're dead.

362
00:18:30,285 --> 00:18:31,719
Cole Younger,

363
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,757
you're under arrest
for the murder of Joshua Webb.

364
00:18:37,092 --> 00:18:40,127
I don't think so, Hoyle.

365
00:18:40,128 --> 00:18:42,497
Boys!

366
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:47,395
That's it, Cole.

367
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:49,664
You're coming with me.

368
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:52,233
Not today, Hoyle.

369
00:19:55,103 --> 00:19:56,871
Hoyle!

370
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:25,666
Lord's miracle,
he made it through the night.

371
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:28,436
- Sunday morning.
- How convenient

372
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:31,105
that Hoyle looks
like he's gonna die today.

373
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:33,207
- On your day.
- What's that mean?

374
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,509
I know you rigged this
so that he would die today

375
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,545
just so you could win
your money, money, money.

376
00:20:37,546 --> 00:20:40,181
Anything could happen today,
that's not my responsibility.

377
00:20:40,182 --> 00:20:43,350
- A wound could get infected, or...
- Oh, oh, nice move.

378
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:47,018
I understand he could die, but I don't
understand why he didn't die yester...

379
00:20:48,056 --> 00:20:49,490
Am I gonna die?

380
00:20:49,491 --> 00:20:51,092
- Yes.
- Yeah.

381
00:20:51,093 --> 00:20:53,394
- Pretty sure.
- Probably.

382
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:56,130
But, really, best shot
we've had as a sheriff.

383
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:58,999
- Really impressive.
- Really impressive. We were all...

384
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,435
- "Wow." That's what we thought.
- Nobody expected it.

385
00:21:01,436 --> 00:21:05,539
What, just because I can point a firearm,
now suddenly you respect me?

386
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,209
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

387
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:12,379
Did the doctor from Dodge City
come in and operate on me?

388
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:16,651
You... We had Vernon
take care of you best he could.

389
00:21:17,285 --> 00:21:19,954
But you don't know anything
about doctoring.

390
00:21:19,955 --> 00:21:23,257
I know a lot more now
than I did about six hours ago.

391
00:21:23,258 --> 00:21:25,192
Did you get the bullet out of my gut?

392
00:21:25,193 --> 00:21:28,162
Couldn't find it. Looked everywhere.

393
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:30,464
What?
I did... One thing did come out.

394
00:21:30,465 --> 00:21:33,100
- I don't know what it is. Looks like a...
- What is that?

395
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:36,003
Like, almost like a turnip, but squishier.

396
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:38,239
Did you get the bullet
out of my shoulder?

397
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,474
Did not know there was one there.

398
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:43,611
I was shot in front of everybody.
Didn't you see me get shot in the shoulder?

399
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:47,581
To be honest, when things get stressful,
I tend to go a little blank

400
00:21:47,582 --> 00:21:49,350
and panic.

401
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,952
So there's a bullet in my shoulder
and a bullet in my stomach.

402
00:21:51,953 --> 00:21:55,689
Basically, you did nothing but take out part
of something and put it in a Mason jar.

403
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,993
- Some swings and some misses.
- All right.

404
00:21:59,127 --> 00:22:01,495
Did Cole bust his brother Ephraim out?

405
00:22:01,496 --> 00:22:02,730
- Yup.
- Yes.

406
00:22:02,731 --> 00:22:06,034
- Got him out.
- Did anyone see which way they went?

407
00:22:06,635 --> 00:22:08,169
- No.
- No.

408
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,372
- Nobody paid attention?
- Why are you so worried about this?

409
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:13,641
I mean, you're halfway out the door,
Hoyle.

410
00:22:13,642 --> 00:22:16,677
This, today's your day, I'm afraid.

411
00:22:16,678 --> 00:22:18,612
No, I'm gonna recover

412
00:22:18,613 --> 00:22:21,649
and I'm gonna get Cole. Eli.

413
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,151
- Eli. We're gonna find Cole
- Yeah?

414
00:22:24,152 --> 00:22:26,621
And we are gonna get
that son of a bitch.

415
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:30,024
It's good to have a positive attitude.

416
00:22:30,025 --> 00:22:32,526
Aah! God.

417
00:22:32,527 --> 00:22:34,762
I think you ripped my stitch.
