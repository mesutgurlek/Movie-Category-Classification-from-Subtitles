1
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,560
Three...

2
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,327
...on the hour...

3
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,739
...every hour.

4
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:36,941
Until somebody talks.

5
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,173
Where is Victorio?

6
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:58,361
Number three, then. That boy.

7
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,621
Hold your fire!

8
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,739
Order your men to lay
down their weapons.

9
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,397
I'm Captain Orrin Draper
of the Texas Rangers.

10
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,041
And my commission is
legal and it runs in...

11
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:23,842
In Texas. This is federal land
under military protection, captain.

12
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:29,147
And as such, I am arresting you and
your men for trespassing and murder.

13
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,717
Murder?

14
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,949
Now lay down your weapons.

15
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:49,072
You let me tell you something
about murder, blue boy.

16
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,737
In less than a week, Victorio
and his renegade Mescaleros...

17
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,278
...burned down nine
rancheros all along Big Bend.

18
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,112
They didn't leave nothing
alive, chick nor child.

19
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:01,310
Now, my men and me, we been
tracking that band for over a month.

20
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:04,081
And the trail led straight here.

21
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:09,089
Your so-called federal land and
your so-called military protection.

22
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,865
Which one of these do you take
for the great Apache war chief?

23
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,829
Texas?

24
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,265
Victorio's here.

25
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:23,341
And 400 mile of his stinking
trail has led me here.

26
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:27,175
And they know he's here, holed
up in some canyon or cave.

27
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:28,973
They ain't saying nothing.

28
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,708
Reservation Indians!

29
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,317
Sergeant Ruth.

30
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,283
Front and center.

31
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,756
Ask the boy what he knows.

32
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,999
Boy says he don't know nothing.

33
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,901
You ain't gonna take that
Injun brat's word, are you?

34
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,507
Even a nigger can't be that stupid.

35
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,907
Corporal Lloyd, Corporal Boyer.

36
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,150
First sergeant?

37
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,087
Let's get these prisoners
ready for transport.

38
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:18,026
All right, I want you all to mount up
and extend your wrists over your pommels.

39
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:26,167
- Get on the horse!
- Corporal Christy.

40
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,510
- First sergeant.
- Corporal...

41
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,646
...the first sergeant intends
to send a detachment out...

42
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:38,443
...to complete a thorough
search of the reservation.

43
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,416
For that...

44
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:43,919
...the first sergeant
requires a sergeant.

45
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:48,925
You think you can hold on to these for
more than a few months this time, sergeant?

46
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,563
Well, I always think so, Wyatt.

47
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:54,524
- That's the hell of it.
- Take half of the muster.

48
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,032
See if you can flush Victorio out.

49
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,298
- And shag that calf home to his mama.
- I got him, Wyatt.

50
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,637
If Victorio's come this deep
into New Mexico territory...

51
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,871
...there has to be a reason.
Richer pickings in Texas.

52
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,516
Easier to jump to Mexico.

53
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,877
You be careful out there.

54
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,313
Don't make me come
looking for them stripes.

55
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,354
You take your own advice, Wyatt.

56
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,789
I ain't the one going
picnicking with rattlesnakes.

57
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,355
First squad on me.

58
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,298
What kind of soldiers are you?

59
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,297
Buffalo soldiers, sergeant!

60
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,095
What kind of a soldier is that?

61
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,568
The best damn kind there is!

62
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,229
Prove it.

63
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:41,639
- Corporal Boyer.
- First squad on me at a trot. Move out.

64
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,238
These are no longer
the colored barracks.

65
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,500
Have the Negro troops
move their belongings...

66
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,144
...across the parade grounds
and set up their tents.

67
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,711
Yes, sir.

68
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:51,713
When I say clean, I mean
plenty of hot water and lye!

69
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,717
I want those barrack bunks
kerosened and tallowed for bugs!

70
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,115
Yes, sir.

71
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:59,348
The second's used to a
certain level of hygiene.

72
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,994
My men expect it.

73
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,629
That'd be John Horse.

74
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,424
Pike's scout. Half black,
half Seminole Indian.

75
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,399
Swamp nigger.

76
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:18,107
Sorry for putting you out
on the streets, Benjamin.

77
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:22,373
I imagine you've been ranked out of
a few post commands in your time, sir.

78
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:26,143
More than a few, if memory serves.

79
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,617
I was in Philadelphia recently.
Just before this posting, actually.

80
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,158
I had memory of your father.

81
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,022
My father.

82
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:41,059
Theo Grierson didn't have much
give to him, and that's a fact.

83
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:45,260
It hurt him to think of you
throwing your life away like this.

84
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,968
One word, Benjamin, and I'll have
you out of this self-imposed exile...

85
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:56,376
...and commanding a real cavalry regiment
within a month of our capturing Victorio.

86
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,881
I volunteered for command
of the 10th, General Pike...

87
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,248
...because I believe
in our Negro troops.

88
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,890
H troop coming in.

89
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,050
Well...

90
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,787
...if that is your belief, sir...

91
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,864
...then this belief will finish you.

92
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:17,833
This experiment with the
coloreds is doomed to failure.

93
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,630
It's been 17 years, sir.

94
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,569
And a waste of time.

95
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,849
Troop...

96
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,284
...dismount!

97
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,887
See to the horses, Sergeant Ruth.

98
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,925
That would be Wyatt, yes?

99
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,587
First Sergeant Washington
Wyatt. Yes, sir.

100
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,099
You've written him up for
meritorious commendation often enough.

101
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,861
With good reason.

102
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,597
He's the best damn
soldier I ever served with.

103
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:58,967
Posting our company near the
latrines. Kicked out of our own beds.

104
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:03,172
Digging holes and shoveling dirt. What
the hell's going on with our barracks?

105
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,283
Watch it, Eddie.

106
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:10,912
Suck those eyes back in your skull,
Tockes, or I'll knock them out full.

107
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,287
- What about the Rangers, sir?
- I'm going to file charges on them.

108
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,760
Secure them here.

109
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,767
I've got a report to make.

110
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,974
And while leaving Sergeant Christy to
continue searching the reservation...

111
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,775
...I brought Draper and his
men back to stand trial, sir.

112
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,145
Stand at ease, sergeant.

113
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,717
That was a fine report. Fine.

114
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,584
Sir, the first sergeant
thanks the general, sir.

115
00:13:55,935 --> 00:14:00,235
Sergeant, besides rescuing
Apaches from Texas Rangers...

116
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:04,900
...I assume you had some other reason
for being on the Mescalero Reservation.

117
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,567
Yes, sir.

118
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,407
On routine patrol, H Troop...

119
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:13,746
...cut trail heading up from the
southeast onto reservation land.

120
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,945
Victorio has kin on the reservation.

121
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:21,889
Now, isn't that exactly what
the Texas Rangers did, sergeant?

122
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,722
No, sir.

123
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,729
H Troop committed no murders, sir.

124
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,267
For those of you
who don't know yet...

125
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,834
...John Horse is my personal scout.

126
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,497
I requested his services
for several reasons.

127
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,165
Stand at ease, sergeant.

128
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:43,077
Not the least being his familiarity with
the Arizona and New Mexico territories.

129
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,513
This last week or so,
Horse has been scouting...

130
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,983
...reports of activity along
the Arizona-New Mexico border.

131
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,143
Mr. Horse.

132
00:14:55,928 --> 00:15:00,558
The Mimbreno Apaches have
left the Arizona reservation...

133
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,667
...because of Nana's vision.

134
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,633
Another vision yet.
Witch doctors, general.

135
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,998
Old fools smearing themselves
with horse dung and corn meal.

136
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:12,769
Praying to the great sky father
to make the white eyes go away.

137
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,879
In Nana's vision...

138
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:22,646
...the Mimbreno joined with
Victorio's Mescaleros...

139
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,622
...to form an army.

140
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,951
The Mimbreno and the
Mescaleros hate each other.

141
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,151
It goes back so far
they don't even know why.

142
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,759
Despite that, they're
willing to band together...

143
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,298
...to drive the whites out
of the Apachería forever.

144
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,429
You see the problem, gentlemen.

145
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,630
If H Troop did track Victorio
onto the Mescalero reservation...

146
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:44,799
...he and Nana are within
spitting distance of each other.

147
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,008
Except I'm not going
to let that happen.

148
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:57,246
I pray you didn't let Victorio
slip through your fingers, sergeant.

149
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:01,120
Just for the sake
of two Apache brats.

150
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:05,655
Sergeant, you're dismissed.

151
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,128
Joju.

152
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,898
You're late, sergeant.

153
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,936
I was with my mount.

154
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:51,270
He wants to pick a fight
with some of the new mounts.

155
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,773
You did good, Sergeant Ruth.

156
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,479
I did what needed doing.

157
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:08,388
I don't like it much,
I don't mind saying.

158
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,927
Put out of our own barracks without
so much as a thank you, kiss my ass.

159
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,662
Wait till Christy finds out. When he
gets back, no telling what he'll do.

160
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,069
Sergeant Christy will do as
ordered. Same as you. Same as me.

161
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,073
Yeah, well...

162
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,515
- Colonel Grierson won't stand for it.
- Same as Colonel Grierson.

163
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,650
Sergeant of the guard!
Sergeant of the guard!

164
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,857
Sergeant Ruth, assemble the men.

165
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,220
Get up! Get up!

166
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:46,092
Riders! Riders coming hard!

167
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,869
William, you all right?

168
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,707
Hell, I'm dead.

169
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,443
I'm just too damn tired to
lay on down and admit it.

170
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,755
We had us a running gunfight
up to that last 10 miles.

171
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,816
- That son of a bitch Draper, he was right.
- Victorio?

172
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:17,189
He out there. We drew him out of
his hiding hole but we lost him...

173
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:20,661
...at the foot of the
Guadalupes. He just disappeared.

174
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,030
Got out ahead of us. Ain't no way
no living man could have done that.

175
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,171
Get out ahead of us
like that and flank us.

176
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,499
Then picked at us
all the way in here.

177
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,539
I mean, he picked at us all the way.

178
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,366
Victorio.

179
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,671
Son of a bitch.

180
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:40,181
From Mesa Caliente it seemed
Victorio managed to outflank...

181
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:43,116
And outmaneuver you, sergeant.

182
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,223
Taking the high ground...

183
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,886
...firing at will upon your men.

184
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,724
- Isn't that how it happened?
- Sir, we couldn't even...

185
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:56,265
General, Sergeant Christy isn't
an hour out of the infirmary.

186
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,062
It might be a good idea if he sat.

187
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,671
No, sir. Thank you, sir.
The sergeant is fine, sir.

188
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,704
Then the sergeant is a liar.

189
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:07,139
Gentlemen, Victorio has
been allowed to escape...

190
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:11,146
...and is once more free to
find and ally himself with Nana.

191
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,752
Tomorrow, C Troop will leave
Fort Craig and not return...

192
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,754
...until Victorio is
either dead or in chains.

193
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,915
I don't care which.

194
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,691
No doubt the 10th is a fine regiment.

195
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:28,526
But even you would have to admit that
H Troop comes in shy on leadership.

196
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,224
General, I'm sorry, I have to...

197
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:32,768
No reflection on Sergeants
Wyatt and Christy.

198
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:37,272
They're not trained to command.
Their kind relays orders.

199
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:38,875
They don't give them.

200
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,108
As the general says, sir.

201
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:50,316
Robert, I want you to
take command of H troop.

202
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,453
And back up C troop in the field.

203
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,499
Command niggers?

204
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,901
General, you're asking me
to throw away my career.

205
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,833
Good God, general,
we can't have that.

206
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,964
What would Bobby do without his fancy
uniform and his little toy sword?

207
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,210
You're out of line, Calhoun.

208
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,573
Out of line, but volunteering.

209
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,475
I'll take H troop, general.

210
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,808
I wonder what your late
father would think...

211
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,044
...about your serving
with field niggers.

212
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,452
Are you interested in my father's
opinion as a slave owner...

213
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:30,061
...colonel in the Army of Northern
Virginia or major in the Union Army, major?

214
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,596
The only interest I have in a traitor
is the date and place of his death.

215
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:36,928
July 2nd, 1863.
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

216
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,002
Perhaps you've heard of it.

217
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,369
Sir.

218
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,772
As the 10th's regimental CO, I'd hope
this would meet with your approval, sir.

219
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,278
Sir?

220
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,779
I have to wonder.

221
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:01,290
Does anyone in this room
remember who the real enemy is?

222
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,631
Schubert, Sergeant Wyatt.

223
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:19,532
<i>You are rest, gentle peace</i>

224
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,729
<i>You are longing And what calms it</i>

225
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,514
I never wanted the Army.

226
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,342
Did I ever tell you that?

227
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:36,615
No?

228
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,415
Well, it's true.

229
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,988
Horses, blue wool.

230
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,628
I don't know which I hate more.

231
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,588
And you, sergeant?

232
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,100
Do you want the Army?

233
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,497
Is this what you and your fellows...

234
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:54,798
...bargained for with
your newfound freedom?

235
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:58,442
Sir, it's not my place to say.

236
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:03,775
Speak up, man. You hold the rank of
first sergeant in the United States Army.

237
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,076
You have the right to an opinion.

238
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,316
I chose the Army, sir.

239
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,018
With all due respect...

240
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:15,318
...my men are scheduled
for target practice.

241
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,661
With your permission.

242
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:24,765
Ruth! Lloyd! Sea! Firing range, now!

243
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,790
Right forward!

244
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,689
Choose right!

245
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:25,796
March!

246
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:36,539
Company, move!

247
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,843
Company, left!

248
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,408
Company, ho!

249
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,296
Why'd the general turn them loose?

250
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:01,591
They murdered them boys, and Pike's
thanking them with fresh horses.

251
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,633
Because they aren't Apaches.
Because they kill Apaches.

252
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,395
Because they're white.

253
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:09,301
And we are at attention, sergeant.

254
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,949
My, my. C Troop.

255
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,486
- Don't they look fine?
- Yep.

256
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,417
- Good enough to eat.
- Hey, now, that's a fact.

257
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:25,954
Just look at old Tockes there.

258
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,991
I think he could polish
off a dozen all by himself.

259
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,458
And don't big Christy
look pretty today?

260
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,825
All patched up with his
spit and baling wire.

261
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,729
And ready to ride and still
looking for some lost soul...

262
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:39,700
...to tag behind that
mule wagon with a shovel.

263
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:43,839
You and your brother got plans for
the next 100 miles or so, Boyer?

264
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,721
Keep your troops
back, Captain Calhoun.

265
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:02,826
Parade regulations. Colored
companies 15 yards behind white.

266
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,400
Prepare to dismount.

267
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,636
- Dismount.
- Dismount.

268
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,476
First sergeant.

269
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,984
What the hell are you
doing, first sergeant?

270
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:32,247
Colored soldiers not supposed to
ride through town with fanfare.

271
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,722
Regulations, captain.

272
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,958
That is not military, first sergeant.

273
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:40,822
It's not for the first
sergeant to say, sir.

274
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,970
Mesa Caliente.

275
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:59,610
This is where Victorio turned
the tables on Christy and H troop.

276
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,315
It's as good a place as any to
split up, cut the Mescaleros trail.

277
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:06,719
I'll take C company south,
captain. You and Wyatt ride north.

278
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:09,519
We'll have to find
something, someone that way.

279
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:12,853
Trot...

280
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,726
...forward.

281
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:18,001
Trot forward!

282
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:17,654
- Troop, halt.
- Why are we stopping, sergeant?

283
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,632
Up ahead, in the rocks. Riflemen.

284
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,599
They're watching us.

285
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:29,798
Could be a feint. Pull us
off Victorio's real trail.

286
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:33,506
There ain't but one way to find
out. Leader, Thomas, Hobley, Wages!

287
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:34,906
- Yes, sir.
- On me.

288
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,514
- Yes, sir.
- Giddap.

289
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,300
They just disappeared.

290
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,091
Fall back! Fall back! Take cover!

291
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,660
Fall back. We're
surrounded. Take cover.

292
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:02,498
Go! Come on! Go! Go!

293
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,782
I'm cut!

294
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:25,283
Come on! Come on!

295
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,093
What are you doing, Eddie?

296
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:38,068
What the hell you gaping at, boy?
Get back to your own business!

297
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,089
Come on, come on, come on.

298
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:38,852
William?

299
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,359
Christy?

300
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,598
- Joju?
- Wyatt?

301
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,202
Right here, Joju.

302
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,664
Right here. Right
here, I'm here. Come on.

303
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,708
- Wyatt?
- Damn.

304
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,540
Son of a bitches.

305
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:57,306
They took my eye. They
took my eye. The good one.

306
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,660
Captain?

307
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,539
Damn!

308
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:32,645
And I was such a pretty thing.

309
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,748
You hit, captain?

310
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,249
You take a bullet?

311
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,983
My back.

312
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,525
My back.

313
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:01,541
My family never owned a slave.

314
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:07,511
Don't tell Major
Carr. Break his heart.

315
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,096
Hold... Hold still.

316
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,599
Come on, come on. Hold still.

317
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:04,208
Oh, I got it. That's it. Hold
still, hold still, hold still.

318
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,237
That's it. That's it.

319
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,545
You know what you're doing, son?

320
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:15,948
Oh, yes, sir. My
granddaddy taught me this.

321
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,350
Fixed all them scars on his back.

322
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:21,424
First sergeant. I need your help.

323
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,617
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

324
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,024
What's wrong with your brother, Carl?

325
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,300
What is it, Andrew?

326
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,394
Don't know.

327
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:36,402
Got ants crawling underneath my skin.

328
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,635
Eating at my vitals.

329
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,513
He doesn't have a fever, sergeant.

330
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:46,946
They're eating me from
the inside out, Carl.

331
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,746
What is it, sergeant?

332
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,587
It's poison.

333
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,951
Poisoned you with them arrows, son.

334
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:00,964
First sergeant?

335
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:03,727
He done it to us again.

336
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:07,166
Victorio. He left behind just enough
shooters to keep us holed up...

337
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:09,898
...while the rest of them
backtracked out of there.

338
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:13,532
- Backtracked?
- Look, we can't let go like this, Wyatt.

339
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,804
I mean to turn Victorio
over to Pike myself...

340
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,642
...and invite him to kiss my
big, black, untrained behind.

341
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:20,784
Give me Tockes, Corporal
Sea and one other.

342
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,388
In the morning, we'll make our way
back, climb up over that crest line...

343
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:27,854
...and sneak up behind them waiting
on us in them rocks as we go.

344
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:31,085
- Hell of a climb, William. You sure?
- I'm sure.

345
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:33,355
I'd rather die doing it
than get picked off...

346
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:35,897
...like cans on a fence.
- Me too.

347
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,467
Get it done then, in the morning.

348
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,842
Hold up. Hold up.

349
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,593
Put down them rifles.

350
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,754
Now.

351
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,134
Tockes, cover me.

352
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:16,999
Corporal Sea, watch them now.

353
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:21,302
- Get over!
- Get down now. You understand me?

354
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:27,314
Told you to put down
that rifle, didn't I?

355
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,919
Lord help us. Sergeant, it's a woman.

356
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,993
She's a damn murdering Apache...

357
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:40,221
...and she'd cut your throat
as soon as look at you.

358
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:41,956
Where is he?

359
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:47,968
Which one of you sons
of bitches took my eye?

360
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,267
Andrew, come on, now. Come on.

361
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:54,707
Come on, now. Andrew, come on, now.

362
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:58,812
Rider approaching, sergeant.

363
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,019
That's the general's scout.

364
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:05,213
You gonna hold on, you hear me?

365
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,847
You gonna hold on, Andrew. Come on.

366
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,632
Carr picked up Victorio's
trail to the south...

367
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,895
...but lost it once
they forded the Gila.

368
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,006
He wants you to come about and...

369
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,792
I been spit on before.

370
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:59,832
- What she say?
- She promised to cut my heart out...

371
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,638
...first chance she got.

372
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,541
Damn.

373
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:25,859
Congratulations, sergeant...

374
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,767
...you've captured Nana.

375
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,341
They killed my brother.

376
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,217
Andy, come on, now.

377
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:08,074
Nana, the great Apache
prophet and wizard.

378
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:12,244
Major Carr will be
sorely disappointed.

379
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:16,316
He wanted Merlin or a charlatan.

380
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,820
Something flamboyant, even if a fake.

381
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,820
What do you think of him, sergeant?

382
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:29,592
I think he's the most
alone man on this earth.

383
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:32,600
Alone? Nana?

384
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:36,672
With the U.S. Army at his throat
and the Apache nation at his feet?

385
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:39,401
Half himself buried...

386
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:43,638
...and the other half left to wander.

387
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,842
Looking for what's dead and gone...

388
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,009
...and it's him.

389
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:02,065
Being a ex-slave in
Mississippi's bad as it gets.

390
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,201
You're colored, new freed.

391
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:09,529
I did what all the
Mississippis couldn't.

392
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:13,766
To prove something
Carr and the general...

393
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:16,242
...would never believe anyway.

394
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:19,573
I will dwell in the
house of the Lord forever.

395
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,482
I killed Andy Boyer.

396
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,215
Amen.

397
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:28,051
And I might as well killed Carl too.

398
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:30,190
Soldiers die, sergeant.

399
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:33,893
- For something.
- You captured the one man...

400
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:39,400
...who had the power to turn a murdering
renegade like Victorio into a holy crusader.

401
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:43,006
You. Not Carr. Not the general.

402
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:44,971
And it brings you...

403
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:47,970
What?

404
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:54,911
Seven dead men.

405
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:03,290
It's brought me seven
dead men, colonel.

406
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:36,216
Y'all heard how we lost
Victorio at the Gila.

407
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:38,384
Yeah, we lost him.

408
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:41,716
But we didn't stop.

409
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,484
No, we crossed the Gila.

410
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:46,960
We followed it south for
miles, then north, backtracking.

411
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:49,696
Looking for signs of Victorio.

412
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,398
Any signs.

413
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:57,640
We found them. We found lots of them.

414
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:01,144
We just couldn't find Victorio.

415
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,844
Maybe if there had
been a few more of us.

416
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:06,380
How's that make you
feel, first sergeant?

417
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:11,018
Knowing you might've been the difference
between life and death for these men?

418
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,057
You got nothing to say?

419
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:18,820
Sir, first sergeant has made a
full report to the post commander.

420
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:24,534
Said report was accepted complete
and without prejudice, sir.

421
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,846
One of these days, Mr. Wyatt...

422
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:40,679
...you're not gonna be able to
hide behind Army regulations.

423
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,240
Have you anything to add...

424
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:09,311
...to Major Carr's
report, Army scout Horse?

425
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,473
I may remember things different.

426
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,749
- How different?
- Not so urgent.

427
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:20,115
Carr knew when he sent
me to find H Troop...

428
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:25,353
...it'd take three days for Calhoun
to join up with him at the Gila.

429
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:28,396
If I found him right off.

430
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:32,900
Whatever Major Carr found
at those homesteads...

431
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:36,506
...was long done before
I could even get back.

432
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:43,173
Anything to add to your
earlier report, sergeant...

433
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,611
...in light of what
Major Carr has said here?

434
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:47,614
No, sir.

435
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:50,020
Lacking proper leadership skills...

436
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,587
...I relied on my
limited field experience.

437
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:56,825
I believed then and I believe now
that the mission was best served...

438
00:44:57,127 --> 00:45:01,291
...by seeing Nana back to Fort
Craig and properly secured.

439
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:14,572
Now, Major Carr...

440
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:18,038
...had every right to
expect reinforcement...

441
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:22,948
...from another troop commander,
another officer. But then...

442
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:28,924
...the first sergeant
isn't an officer.

443
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:34,693
- Are you, sergeant?
- No, sir.

444
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,833
Of course, Captain Calhoun's death...

445
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,061
...placed the sergeant in a position
he readily admits was just too...

446
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,798
It was just too complicated
for him to handle.

447
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:45,839
Upon further
consideration, I accept...

448
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:48,409
...that Sgt. Wyatt acted
to the best of his ability.

449
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,373
You are out of line, Major Carr!

450
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:52,742
Step carefully, Colonel Grierson.

451
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,144
You step carefully!

452
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:57,082
You are dangerously
close to insubordination!

453
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,984
Draw upon your charges! I will
no longer sit in silence...

454
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:01,886
...while you and your fice terrier...

455
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:05,222
- I resent this, general!
...chew at this man! My men!

456
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:10,230
For God's sakes! Have you
forgotten who brought you Nana?

457
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:19,065
You are absolutely right, colonel.

458
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:23,437
What matters is that I have Nana...

459
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:27,550
...the soul of the Apache uprising.

460
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:32,280
But Victorio is still the heart...

461
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,890
...and Victorio is still free...

462
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:38,585
...and I want him. I want him dead!

463
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:42,562
Before I have to look at
another mutilated white man!

464
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:45,793
Am I making myself clear?

465
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,872
God, will he never shut up?

466
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:14,588
What sort of trick was that, anyway?

467
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:19,027
Dragging dead folk out like that?

468
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:22,204
Just for folks to gawk and stare.

469
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:24,966
It's a shame and a pity.

470
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,303
That's what my mama would say.

471
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:31,880
Shoot. Your mama never had
words for what Carr did today...

472
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:34,040
...and you be glad of it.

473
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:38,245
I'd kill anybody who'd try to
do my brother Andy that way.

474
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:42,154
Toss his body out
like he's an animal.

475
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:45,150
He's just trying to stir things up.

476
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:48,630
I mean, look how he
baited the sergeant.

477
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:54,237
Yeah. Yeah, and Grierson
never said a word.

478
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,696
Colonel Grierson wasn't there.

479
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:02,835
He wasn't gonna say nothing
nohow. Pike's in charge now.

480
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:07,040
Grierson's about as
useless as tits on a boar.

481
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:11,478
One more word out of you, Tockes, and
I'm gonna put the chains on you myself.

482
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,261
Something I can do for you, scout?

483
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:29,804
Thought maybe you
might like to thank me.

484
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:35,203
- Thank you?
- For going on record against Carr.

485
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,909
Damn, are you such a stupid nigger?

486
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:42,413
Maybe.

487
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:49,321
Why don't you tell me what
kind of nigger you think I am...

488
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,759
...'breed.

489
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,921
If Grierson and I
hadn't backed you...

490
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:59,326
...Carr would've managed to
get you drawn up on charges.

491
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:04,463
I asked you to tell me what
kind of nigger you think I am.

492
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:07,735
I don't understand you.

493
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:11,905
I don't understand who you are.

494
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,750
I'm a first sergeant in
the United States Army.

495
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:20,052
Army?

496
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:24,224
Army bares you no love.

497
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:28,522
None of you. They endure you.

498
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:33,331
They'll endure you...

499
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:37,872
...until they've wiped all
the tribes from the slate...

500
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:41,242
...with our blood.

501
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:52,044
You have no pride, first sergeant.

502
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:56,388
You have no pride.

503
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:06,362
One thing's for sure, scout...

504
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:11,503
...I didn't leave it in a bowl
on the floor next to Pike's boots.

505
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:19,944
Lights out.

506
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,196
Now maybe you'll shut up!

507
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:49,197
- Come on, now.
- Dang, Roseman...

508
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:51,391
...you look like you
died and gone to heaven.

509
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:53,593
It weren't no accident
Jesus was a carpenter.

510
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:55,931
What kind of notch you
done chopped in here?

511
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:57,664
It's a dovetailed finger joint.

512
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,138
Well, it ain't dovetailing.

513
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,470
It's cut right. Ain't my
fault it ain't fitting.

514
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:05,172
Well, if it don't fit, this log ain't
no good for nothing but firewood.

515
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:08,374
Wyatt, this thing ain't
gonna stay up here by itself.

516
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:10,247
Wyatt!

517
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,752
Next time you ride your
horse out from under you...

518
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:14,891
...I’m gonna leave
your butt in the desert.

519
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,251
What you looking at, old fool?

520
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:20,828
Young fool, I guess.

521
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:33,233
I was just going to
send for you, sergeant.

522
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:37,369
Well, step up. Don't
tell me you've gone shy.

523
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:42,012
There's been news. Good
or bad, it's your call.

524
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:44,312
Horse has been out
scouting the last two days.

525
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:46,853
He thinks he may have
cut two separate trails.

526
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:50,550
Victorio's Mescaleros
and Nana's Mimbrenos.

527
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:54,288
While we've been here acting like the
Apache Wars were all but finished...

528
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:58,833
...the Mimbrenos have actually made
it into the heart of the territory.

529
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:03,063
From what I saw and
pieced together...

530
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:09,402
...both armies intend to link up at one
of the watering holes along this route.

531
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,342
They have to.

532
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:15,245
There's no other way to cross some
of that desert and get out alive.

533
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:19,684
All we have to do is figure out
which one and get there first.

534
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:22,654
I was going to send for you,
sergeant, because I intend...

535
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,521
...to give this mission to H Troop.

536
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:30,031
I know Major Carr's report cast
a pall over the capture of Nana...

537
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,600
...through no fault of your own.

538
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:36,199
I'd imagine you and your colored
troops would appreciate a chance...

539
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:39,706
...to set the record
straight. For good and all.

540
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,572
I'll be in command, Wyatt.

541
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:48,012
It's been a while since you
and I took the field together.

542
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:51,676
H Troop will be ready to take
the field, dawn tomorrow, sir.

543
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:56,616
Andy's dead.

544
00:54:57,761 --> 00:55:00,696
You think Pike or
Grierson even cares?

545
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,230
Even noticed that a face was missing?

546
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:10,403
What, you think they lose sleep over
every white face missing from roll call?

547
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:14,805
Boy, now, I want to live
in the world you come from.

548
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:18,077
Yeah, they didn't
even know he was dead.

549
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:20,606
Didn't even know he was here.

550
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:23,014
See, that's what kills a body.

551
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:25,749
We're not soldiers, we're sponges...

552
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:28,948
...going around soaking up
the blood and the guts...

553
00:55:29,392 --> 00:55:31,121
...and for what?

554
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:36,496
Until I joined this here Army,
I didn't even know me no Indians.

555
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:39,032
Never even cared to meet one.

556
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:41,236
Now I've killed a dozen...

557
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:43,133
...and I have to wonder why.

558
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:46,434
Because some white boy with
gold braid on his arm...

559
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:49,806
...tells us to, that's
why, and we let them.

560
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:53,779
Everyone of us gave them the right
to tell us what to do, when to do it.

561
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:57,517
We might as well be back on the
block, the mess we made of this thing.

562
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:00,520
Well, everybody got something to say.

563
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:02,986
How about you, Wesley?

564
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:05,889
You feeling misunderstood these days?

565
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:08,087
I like the Army.

566
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:12,325
It ain't a bad place to be
when you slow and to the point.

567
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:15,130
Somebody tell you what
to do and you do it.

568
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:16,602
And the food pretty good.

569
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:22,200
Lord have mercy, boy. What's
the matter with you, son?

570
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:30,377
Nana's Mimbrenos are still looking
to join with Victorio's Mescaleros.

571
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:33,816
Tomorrow this troop
goes after Victorio.

572
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:38,817
We don't come back until he's
captured or dead. Or we are.

573
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:09,055
Bringing Nana and
his children along...

574
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:11,455
I don't know, are you
sure that's a good idea?

575
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:13,823
Best protection we got, colonel.

576
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:15,862
Most Apache riflemen
would think twice...

577
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:18,364
...before taking a chance
at hitting the old man.

578
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:21,333
I'd carry him in my
pocket if I could.

579
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:13,482
Victorio's here.

580
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:18,154
Power meant to warn us off.

581
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,925
Here's where Horse first cut track.

582
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:24,089
Now we know Victorio
is partial to this area.

583
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:28,203
It's easy for him to skedaddle down
into Mexico first sign of a blue coat.

584
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:33,570
These watering holes run
20 miles all through here.

585
00:58:33,743 --> 00:58:37,304
So we'll cut trailside along here...

586
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:39,973
...flank him, come around...

587
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:44,950
...and beat him to the water hole.
Whichever water hole. That'd be the plan.

588
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:48,852
We cannot outmarch the Apaches.

589
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,289
We don't travel like that.

590
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:54,825
We could try, sir. We could try.

591
00:58:57,634 --> 00:59:00,102
Troops forward! Troops
forward! They shot the colonel!

592
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:03,933
Half muster to the left!
Rally on the colonel!

593
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:09,106
They've shot the colonel!
Rally on the colonel!

594
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:11,770
Rally on the colonel!
Free the sergeant!

595
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:13,176
All dismount!

596
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:17,080
Take that hill! Come
on, get up that hill!

597
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:20,479
Advance the ridge!

598
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:22,355
Advance the ridge!

599
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:33,731
- There's nobody here!
- Damn!

600
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:44,374
How is he?

601
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:48,081
Wyatt, come here.

602
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:55,281
Sergeant...

603
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:58,716
...I’m relinquishing
command of the troop to you.

604
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:02,061
Washington...

605
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:06,160
...I don't know if I'm
gonna live an hour or a week.

606
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:09,066
It doesn't matter.

607
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:12,770
- It matters.
- No. The mission matters.

608
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:17,775
This regiment, H Troop, they matter.

609
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:22,751
If we fail in this, men like Pike...

610
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:27,822
...will use it to force men
like you out of the Army.

611
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:29,722
We...

612
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:34,194
You can't let that happen.

613
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:40,860
We've come so... So far.

614
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:49,377
Always knew what you tried
to do for us, colonel.

615
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:57,542
Take him home.

616
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:15,764
Maybe that's the direction
we all should be heading.

617
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:18,702
You can leave whenever
you choose, scout.

618
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:20,433
What about us, sergeant?

619
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:23,704
Are we any less than Grierson,
left to be picked off, one by one?

620
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,816
Fighting men. We have more in
common with them than we dare admit.

621
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:30,617
Found a conscience, have you?

622
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:34,755
No telling where you'll
find one these days.

623
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:36,956
Don't cross me, scout.

624
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:40,186
I'm a free man, Wyatt.

625
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:45,692
I come and go at my pleasure...

626
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:48,166
...for my reasons.

627
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:51,596
Can you say the same?

628
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:22,663
Any man without the balls to follow
me after Victorio, fall out now.

629
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:26,540
You and the scout can catch up
with the detail, head back to post.

630
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:29,443
But any man stays...

631
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:34,042
...stays from here on out
and keeps his mouth shut.

632
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:37,881
Any man deserts on my watch,
I'll put a bullet in his head.

633
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:39,885
And any man talks mutiny...

634
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:42,786
...I'll rip him apart
with my bare hands.

635
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,056
Is that understood?

636
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:58,734
All right, Wyatt.

637
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:01,066
You're the man.

638
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:03,239
What now?

639
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:06,975
Take the girl, Corporal Tockes.

640
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:11,644
Come on, girl! Shut up! Shut up!

641
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:12,981
Do what I do, corporal.

642
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:15,254
You wanna help the
girl? This old man?

643
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:18,222
You translate exactly what I
say, word for word, you hear me?

644
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,134
- Weapon ready, corporal?
- Weapon ready, sergeant.

645
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:34,508
I'm running out of time. I'm gonna
ask you once. Corporal Tockes...

646
01:03:34,677 --> 01:03:36,474
...if this man
refuses to answer me...

647
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,308
...you will shoot the girl
in the back of her head.

648
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:46,352
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Old man, where is Victorio?

649
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,322
- I said, shut up!
- Corporal Tockes, shoot the girl!

650
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,461
- You can't!
- Sarge, you sure?

651
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:54,653
- Sure, I'm sure!
- Come on!

652
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,162
Shut up! Shut up!

653
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:57,993
Give me that!

654
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:03,733
The watering holes!

655
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:05,430
I know that, old man! Which one?

656
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:10,839
Rattlesnake Springs!

657
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:22,714
Victorio is making for Rattlesnake
Springs to meet with the Mimbrenos.

658
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:25,884
Our job's simple: Be there first.

659
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:28,530
That's 50 miles more
than we got water for.

660
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,290
We have our orders, William!

661
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:32,195
I thought you was
in charge, sergeant.

662
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:34,165
I am!

663
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:15,542
There is something you're
gonna need to see, Wyatt.

664
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,888
The Rangers.

665
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:56,675
Kill me.

666
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,181
For the love of God, man.

667
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:05,324
Kill me.

668
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,000
Shoot him, Tockes.

669
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,586
- Troop, ho!
- Troop, ho!

670
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:15,128
- Bivouac here for the night, sergeant.
- Troop...

671
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:16,730
...dismount!

672
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:23,037
Joju's been shot!
Everybody down! Dismount!

673
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:26,002
Wyatt!

674
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:28,370
That's the last bullet
I'll take for you, Wyatt.

675
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:29,909
All right, all right, Joju.

676
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,512
Get those horses out of here.

677
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,012
- Get these horses out of here!
- Move those horses!

678
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:36,117
Get him off the horse! Dismount!

679
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:39,020
Single sniper over
here, to the right.

680
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:40,815
Over to your right.

681
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:43,021
Get the horses out of here!

682
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,552
Scout, you're following me up.

683
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:53,367
Horse, you're coming with me.

684
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:56,562
I don't mean to come back and
find you gone, and my men too.

685
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,687
Cover us, Tockes.

686
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:09,939
Scout!

687
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:45,417
Oh, my God!

688
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:48,890
Oh, my God! We did it.

689
01:12:49,064 --> 01:12:51,498
We outsmarted the
damn freaking Apache.

690
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:53,658
They're still about
a couple hours away.

691
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:56,393
From what?

692
01:12:56,572 --> 01:12:59,132
See that ridge behind us?

693
01:12:59,641 --> 01:13:01,700
That sits right above
Rattlesnake Springs.

694
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:04,243
And that's where we gotta
be in less than an hour.

695
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,115
Corporal Sea...

696
01:13:09,284 --> 01:13:13,118
...I want all four platoons up to the edge
of that ridge above Rattlesnake Springs.

697
01:13:13,288 --> 01:13:15,256
Nobody stays back with the horses.

698
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:21,090
Wyatt, if we have to retreat, we
won't have any mounts, any supplies.

699
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:22,992
We ain't got no way back, damn it.

700
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:25,292
Victorio has a hundred warriors.

701
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:27,901
You can pretty much
rule out retreat, Tockes.

702
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:31,004
Corporal, pick ten
men from your platoon.

703
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:35,405
I want the mouth of that canyon
sealed as soon as Victorio's inside.

704
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:39,912
All right, sergeant.

705
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:25,958
Yeah! Water, here we come!

706
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:49,247
Tockes, get their attention.

707
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:50,646
Troopers, attention!

708
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:52,778
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

709
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:55,549
Help the wounded and
get those canteens full.

710
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:58,090
I want this place
swept clear of tracks...

711
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,524
...and everybody on
that ridge in 15 minutes.

712
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:10,223
Never think they might do that.

713
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:12,297
Play splash and such.

714
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:27,773
This is it. Let's move.

715
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:34,278
Drop your weapons.

716
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:35,956
Do not fire, do not fire.

717
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:41,625
Drop your weapons now!

718
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:44,531
I said, drop it!

719
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:48,636
Put your weapons down. Drop them now.

720
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:14,729
Scout, tell them we want to talk.

721
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:38,148
I want to speak to Victorio.

722
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,220
The war chief, Victorio.

723
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:53,797
This is Victorio, sergeant.

724
01:18:11,987 --> 01:18:14,012
Victorio, the man...

725
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:17,022
...not the myth.

726
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:39,908
We named you Buffalo
Soldiers, for your hair.

727
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:44,609
It was a good naming. You
are much like the buffalo.

728
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:49,280
On the move, you stop for
nothing. A good naming, I think.

729
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:53,622
I think so too. We
made it for our own.

730
01:18:56,465 --> 01:19:00,196
When an enemy praises an
enemy, the smart man listens.

731
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:09,735
I've come for you,
Victorio. You know that.

732
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:19,249
Are you a slave?

733
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:27,260
No, I am not a slave.

734
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:34,460
You were a slave.

735
01:19:35,036 --> 01:19:36,765
Yes, I was.

736
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:44,369
Why do you fight for those
who were your masters...

737
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:47,174
...Washington Wyatt?

738
01:19:47,349 --> 01:19:50,512
Sir, you are surrounded.

739
01:19:50,685 --> 01:19:53,950
We hold the high ground.
You cannot escape.

740
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:59,126
I am offering you a
means of surrender.

741
01:20:00,395 --> 01:20:01,862
We will fight you.

742
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:05,095
And fight for our dead.

743
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:08,530
We will not be slaves like you.

744
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:12,503
I wish to save as many
of you here as possible.

745
01:20:12,674 --> 01:20:16,303
I cannot promise much
for yourself or...

746
01:20:17,946 --> 01:20:21,313
Why? Why do you murder my people...

747
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:24,281
...for those who made
you less than cattle?

748
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:27,684
Please.

749
01:20:28,924 --> 01:20:31,154
You have children here.

750
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:34,295
Old people. Lay down your weapons.

751
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:46,130
Believe this, then.

752
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:51,510
Come tomorrow's sun...

753
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:58,116
...I will kill every man,
woman and child in this canyon.

754
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:01,686
And it will be on your head.

755
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:07,654
Tell him that.

756
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:47,126
<i>Though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death...</i>

757
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:50,897
<i>... I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.</i>

758
01:21:51,873 --> 01:21:56,333
<i>Thou preparest a table before
me in the presence of my enemies.</i>

759
01:21:57,479 --> 01:22:02,075
Thou anointeth my head with
oil. My cup runneth over.

760
01:23:56,331 --> 01:23:57,889
We can't do this.

761
01:23:58,566 --> 01:24:00,557
Wyatt.

762
01:24:02,137 --> 01:24:04,162
We can't do this.

763
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:06,536
They're nothing.

764
01:24:08,076 --> 01:24:11,705
Hungry, starving...

765
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:13,871
...dying where they stand.

766
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:17,576
Then I'm doing them a favor.
Putting them out of their misery.

767
01:24:17,919 --> 01:24:20,080
How can you do this, Wyatt?

768
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:22,746
How can you live with this?

769
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:26,856
It'll be on your soul, Wyatt.

770
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:35,196
Pick your target.

771
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:08,067
I will fire the first shot.

772
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:11,803
On my shot, commence firing.

773
01:25:26,354 --> 01:25:29,881
Lord, have mercy.

774
01:26:22,143 --> 01:26:24,475
Army scout Horse.

775
01:26:26,814 --> 01:26:29,078
How far is it to the Mexican border?

776
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:10,881
Victorio. Mexico.

777
01:27:49,397 --> 01:27:52,423
I will deliver the following report:

778
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:55,899
We could not hold Victorio.

779
01:27:56,070 --> 01:28:00,530
He fought through our
barricades, taking Nana with him.

780
01:28:00,708 --> 01:28:05,509
We regret their escape, but with
food and water running low...

781
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:08,410
...believed it best
to return to post.

782
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:12,485
We will pursue at a later date.

783
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,483
Is that not correct, gentlemen?

784
01:28:15,657 --> 01:28:17,716
Yes, sir!

785
01:28:30,905 --> 01:28:36,502
You do not use the word
"sir" for the first sergeant.

786
01:28:37,178 --> 01:28:38,736
You only...

787
01:28:39,447 --> 01:28:40,914
...salute.

788
01:29:15,383 --> 01:29:17,578
It's the Fourth of July, sergeant.

789
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:30,429
