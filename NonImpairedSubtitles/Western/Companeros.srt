1
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,200
I'm sorry, penguin...

2
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,700
...but if you insist I'm going to have
to put a hole in your head.

3
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,940
And I'll have to choose
another target...

4
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,520
...there's already a cave
in place of your brain.

5
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:07,690
When we first met, the hole in
Vasco's head was even deeper.

6
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,770
At that time, he was
just a poor man.

7
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,700
One of the many wretched souls
living in Mexico when...

8
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,200
...Porfirio Diaz...

9
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,930
...was trying any thing to win the
presidency for the fifth time.

10
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,510
And his tactics weren't
always the friendliest.

11
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,250
- Who are you voting for?
- Porfirio Diaz.

12
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,310
Ricardo Vuelta.

13
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,990
- Who are you voting for?
- I vote against Diaz.

14
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,740
Take him to the wall!

15
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,330
Dad!

16
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,180
Platoon! Load arms!

17
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,470
Aim!

18
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,940
Fire!

19
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,750
And who are you voting for?

20
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,230
Who could a guy
like me vote for?

21
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:25,730
You didn't answer my question.
Who are you voting for?

22
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,100
Are you deaf or what?

23
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,770
I'm sorry, general?

24
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,540
I want to know who you're
voting for. You worm!

25
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,480
Answer me!

26
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,060
Long live Mexico!

27
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,250
Long live our revolution!

28
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,030
Long live our Xantos!

29
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,020
Long live our Xantos!

30
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,100
Who is the brave one that
started the rebellion?

31
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,220
Good job, son.
What's your name?

32
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,190
they call me Vasco, because
I always where this hat.

33
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,230
And since my parents
were Basque...

34
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,440
...my father used to clean public
toilets in Spain.

35
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,710
He came here with big ideas.

36
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,970
He wanted to introduce the
idea of pay toilets to Mexico.

37
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:15,340
But he enjo yed hookers so much
he spent his very last penny...

38
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,980
...and became a janitor
at the San Bernardino toilets.

39
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,920
You know San Bernardino
pretty well?

40
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,460
Pretty well? Of course,
I was born there.

41
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,580
Very good, Vasco.

42
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:32,570
Be the leader of my men.
they are brave people.

43
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,440
Lead them to the attack!
Conquer San Bernardino!

44
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,410
Destro y the Regulares!
Annihilate thexantistas!

45
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,410
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes, to you!

46
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,700
I now appoint you my lieutenant
and commander with full powers!

47
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,110
To Vasco!

48
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,110
Long live Mexico!

49
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,280
Long live the revolution!

50
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,690
Long live Vasco!

51
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,130
Vasco didn't know it yet, but
for a dangerous new job...

52
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,940
...Mongo would always
appoint a new lieutenant.

53
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,230
The General would always arrive
when everything was over.

54
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,380
And that also happened
at San Bernardino...

55
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,340
...where the conquerors were busy
celebrating their victory...

56
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,580
...it was at that point, I arrived.

57
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,610
Don't move, compañero!
Why are you dressed like that?

58
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,520
What side are you on?
Where do you think you're going?

59
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,390
What are you doing with
that wagon? What's in there?

60
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,990
Why are you asking so many
questions? Let's just kill him!

61
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,630
Your friend is right, compañero.

62
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,440
When you're about to die,
you don't ask so many questions.

63
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,070
Good job, Vasco!
It's all for the glory of Mexico!

64
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,780
- Good job Vasco!
- Who is she?

65
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,080
Why are you so pissed?

66
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,620
Do you like the way I shoot?

67
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,990
Do you like the way I shoot?

68
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,960
Are you one of them?
Then I'll need to search you.

69
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,860
Yes! Go ahead and search her!

70
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,370
Bravo, Vasco!

71
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,420
Forgive me. I'm sorry.

72
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,740
Come on, shoot that little pig!

73
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:26,950
He y, look! There's a
penguin in San Bernardino!

74
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,230
Let's see if the
penguin likes bananas.

75
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,370
Come, here. Come on, come on.

76
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,730
Come to daddy.
Take this nice banana.

77
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,610
Ex cuse me, would you please tell
me who threw this banana peel?

78
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,950
- I did, why?
- Oh, it was you?

79
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,800
This for is you. Take it.

80
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,540
- For me?
- Pretend you won a bet.

81
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,280
Please, can you tell me
which is the best hotel in town?

82
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:13,560
The best hotel in town?
Well, that's the only one.

83
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,100
It smells like piss,
but you'll get used to it.

84
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,540
Thanks. You're a real gentleman.
I'm very grateful to you.

85
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,510
No problem, no problem at all, sir.
God bless you. God bless you.

86
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,520
No problem, no problem at all.

87
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,320
Vasco, why do you think
he gave you that dollar?

88
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,050
Because the jerk was scared.

89
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:22,660
I'm looking for General Mongo.
Where I can find him, please?

90
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:27,570
General Mongo's busy
conducting a revolution.

91
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,040
Didn't you notice?

92
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:34,410
I did hear a few shots and
see a few dead bodies but...

93
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:39,310
...I thought it was
the typical local folklore.

94
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:45,090
I'd like to have your best room,
and a hot bath, please.

95
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:51,190
We only have one, and it's taken by
that gentleman, over there.

96
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,670
He must be important,
that gentleman, over there.

97
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:08,210
Yes, he's one of General Mongo's
officers, the strongest.

98
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,510
- What's his name?
- Who?

99
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:18,480
- Him. The strongest one.
- Pepito. Pepito Tigrero.

100
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,320
Pepito.

101
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:32,030
Pepito Tigrero. Here we are!

102
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,900
Now the room is free, prepare
a nice little bath for me.

103
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,500
And where's Pepito Tigrero
going to stay?

104
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,800
At the hospital.

105
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,040
Please forgive me.

106
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,610
Your mother is a prostitute,
your father's a crook and...

107
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,620
...your grandfather is a man
with avery broad buttocks.

108
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,350
What did you say?

109
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:01,560
I'll explain. Your mother's a whore,
your father's a damn thief...

110
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:05,230
...and your grandfather's
a notorious fag.

111
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,860
How dare you?

112
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,570
I generously spared your sister.

113
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:28,980
Now you know me. Tell General
Mongo the Swede is here.

114
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,260
Nice to see you again, miss.

115
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:12,970
Although, I'd rather entertain
beautiful girls in private.

116
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:25,540
Since the conversation is dying out,
I'm going to relax a little.

117
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,550
I hope this won't bother you.

118
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,790
Or maybe there's
something I can do for you?

119
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,050
You can join our side.

120
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,160
Why should I do that?

121
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,900
Because we are on the
side of the reason.

122
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,900
It is not always a good reason.

123
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:54,470
We, thexantistas, are fighting
for justice and freedom.

124
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,140
Ours is a just cause.

125
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,680
I heard that in every
country I sold guns in.

126
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,840
You must not sell
the weapons to Mongo.

127
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,320
- He's a bandit.
- That's why he pays well.

128
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:10,450
You're like all the other strangers,
despicable and merciless.

129
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,560
Let's not exaggerate. To me,
it's only a question of price.

130
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:20,000
If you make a better offer,
the arms are yours.

131
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,660
We're mainly students.

132
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,830
And we are fighting to defend the
poor people. We are not rich.

133
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,410
Students or bandits, to me it
doesn't make any difference.

134
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,380
Send your leader to me.

135
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,480
If he offers more than Mongo,
we might be close to an agreement.

136
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,050
Our leader is a prisoner
of the Gringos.

137
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,580
A prisoner? What do you mean?

138
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,890
While Madero, Villa, and Zapata
were fighting against Diaz...

139
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,630
...we, who are followers of
Professor Xantos...

140
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,330
...started our own revolution
in these territories.

141
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,570
But when Mongo and his bandits
arrived, our leader left...

142
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,670
...for the U.S.A., in seeking help for
our cause, the cause...

143
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,870
...of freedom and justice.
Okay, that's pretty clear.

144
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,680
And what happened after that?

145
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,340
America knew that if
the Professor returned...

146
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,890
...their interest in the Mexican
oil wells would be lost.

147
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:15,890
Pretending to protect him,
they locked him up at Fort Yuma.

148
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,920
He's been there for
six months now.

149
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,160
No way, nothing's
going to wake him up.

150
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,390
The penguin hits pretty hard, huh?

151
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,500
If he's that strong, I don't think he
gave you that dollar out of fear.

152
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,330
Vasco!

153
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,880
they killed two of our men,
down at the station.

154
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,240
they say the Gringo did it.

155
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,340
Let's go.

156
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,340
He y, something's going
on down at the square!

157
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,350
Come on, out through the window.

158
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:55,100
Quick! If they find you
here, we're in trouble!

159
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,500
Look over there!
Somebody's running away!

160
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,570
Long livexantos!

161
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:13,310
Working for free usually
brings me bad luck. Come on.

162
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,480
He shouted, "Long livexantos!",
before he fell.

163
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,850
they were coming out
of the penguin's room.

164
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,320
I'm getting nervous.

165
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:11,370
Get out of the bed or
it'll turn into your coffin.

166
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,440
If you're nervous because of your
interest in the girl, be my guest.

167
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,950
You know very well why I'm here.

168
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:25,120
You're plotting to
help thexantistas.

169
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,220
If in Mexico, what
I'm doing, is called plotting...

170
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:32,850
Stop wasting time, Vasco.
He's a Xantista. Let's kill him now!

171
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,960
Yes, let's kill him! Shut up!

172
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:43,660
You are accused of killing two
of our men, down at the station.

173
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,340
Are you denying that?

174
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,910
If you understood the Latin saying,
"Mors tuavita mea"...

175
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:56,360
...you would understand
why I did it.

176
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:00,660
But I guess you did not attend
any courses in Humanities.

177
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,070
So you better go
call General Mongo.

178
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:06,470
He's a good friend of mine and
I'm sure he's waiting for me.

179
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:10,540
What's waiting for you is
something else, you'll see.

180
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,700
- Take him away.
- Move!

181
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,480
- See you later.
- Move fast!

182
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,250
Yes, I'll see you later.
Don't worry.

183
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,170
Mexicans aren't good
enough for you?

184
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:48,410
But I've got a special treatment
for those of your kind.

185
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:58,720
Penguin, what was that thing about
"morsel two and vita mea"?

186
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,760
Tell me again. I forgot about it.

187
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,300
I'd like to explain to you that,
as a foreign citizen...

188
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,430
...I'm entitled to the protection
of my Country's ambassador.

189
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,940
- But I guess there's no point to it.
- You're right.

190
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,140
That's what I thought.

191
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,770
And the General? Did he arrive?

192
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:23,050
No, but the time has
arrived for you to die.

193
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,380
You're making a big mistake.

194
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,820
I told you, the General's my
friend. He's the one who called me.

195
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,950
When the General is away,
I'm the one in charge here.

196
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,550
You'll see what a nice trick
I've prepared for you.

197
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,090
Anyhow, listen to me...

198
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,570
...if you tell me why
you gave me this dollar...

199
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:46,610
...I'll make sure you die instantly.
I won't let you suffer.

200
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:51,340
You don't want to know.
You'll feel too bad.

201
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:55,370
You're going to feel
a lot worse, I promise you.

202
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,250
You start as soon
as I raise my hand!

203
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,050
My hands are busy.
Send someone to rub my nose.

204
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,700
People of Mexico!

205
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:21,870
You're about to witness the
squashing of the head...

206
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,300
...of this son of a penguin!

207
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:33,740
- For General Mongo, charge!
- Let's go!

208
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,900
Get rid of that old jalopy!
Get it out!

209
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,200
Get it out!

210
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:55,260
How dare you insult your
General's car! You piece of shit!

211
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,530
You are demoted,
you son of a bitch!

212
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,050
You're lucky I'm only removing
your rank and not your head!

213
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,580
Get out of my way and
don't come back!

214
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,710
- Out of my way, I said!
- Of course, General.

215
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,650
Of course, of course.
I'm leaving right now.

216
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,420
Where is the Swede?

217
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:15,150
I'm going to hang you all if you
don't bring him to me alive, now!

218
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,490
Mongo, my friend, you don't
know how much I missed you.

219
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:29,930
By San Bernardino, to me your
life is worth less than garbage.

220
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,710
Diaz's government is a cesspool.

221
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:37,680
And I don't give a damn about
thexantista's high ideals.

222
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,410
I expect something better
from the revolution.

223
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,120
I want a large sum of money.

224
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,060
And since the money is
locked in a Swedish safe...

225
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,260
...it takes a Swede to open it,
a son of a bitch like you.

226
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,920
I do share your noble
ideals, General.

227
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,470
But why do you need
a safe to get rich?

228
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:03,100
You have the whole city to loot.
Just sell that statue.

229
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,110
It's ancient and worth
a lot of dough.

230
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,700
You're crazy!

231
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:11,050
No Mexican would dare put
a hand on that holy relic.

232
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,350
No. You're going to help
me get a hold of the money.

233
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,220
I'll tell them we need it to buy
your arms, and we'll share it.

234
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:24,350
I'll give you a third of the loot
and I'll be gone with the rest of it.

235
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:34,170
You'll be the alibi to fool
them all. How does that sound?

236
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,880
Very ingenious.

237
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:43,610
What's going on? What are
they doing, those idiots?

238
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:52,150
You're acting like animals!
Stop firing! It won't help!

239
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:59,600
This damn safe contains all
the riches of our nation.

240
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:05,600
But my men were never
able to open it.

241
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,670
If you want to be paid
for your arms, you open it.

242
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,170
You do know how, don't you?

243
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,200
Well?

244
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:53,450
It's a Svenson, wheel model.
Reinforced, triple German steel.

245
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,950
It's got a special
combination lock.

246
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,620
It weighs more than two tons.
God himself couldn't open it.

247
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:03,130
The only way is to
know the combination.

248
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:06,220
There must be some
manager or clerk who knows it.

249
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,770
Or did you kill them all?

250
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:12,740
All ex cept for one,
Professor Xantos. He's in Yuma now.

251
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:15,900
But, how can we possibly
bring him back here?

252
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,880
It's not impossible.

253
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,940
I'll take care of it.

254
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:26,690
I'll go to Yuma. And I'll bring
Xantos back to San Bernardino.

255
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,650
Of course! How wonderful!

256
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,320
With that money, we're on
our way to a glorious victory!

257
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Thank you, Swede. Thank you in
behalf of our beloved fatherland.

258
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,070
You're welcome. We'll split the
treasure my way. Half and half.

259
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,880
Three shares for me,
one for you.

260
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:57,820
Take it or leave it General.
Do you agree?

261
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,580
Rest assure that we trust you
unconditionally. Go then!

262
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:04,350
Go! Come back with our enemy!

263
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:08,620
- General Mongo. General Mongo!
- I n you we trust.

264
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,930
Sorry for intruding.

265
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,230
May I?

266
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:20,370
I may be just a piece of crap.
But what about you?

267
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,610
You're going to trust some one
who killed two of our men?

268
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,870
What if he's a spy?

269
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,640
He's right, Mongo!

270
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,110
What else can we do then?

271
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:36,080
As a foreigner, he's the only
one who can cross the border.

272
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,920
Any Mexican would be stopped.

273
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:42,450
Not a Mexican accompanied by
a citizen of a neutral country.

274
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,400
Why don't you come with me?

275
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,690
You can keep an e ye on me,
and help me too.

276
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,790
Right!

277
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:52,000
I won't be your servant!
I will not serve a stupid penguin!

278
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,600
I understand. You're scared.

279
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:04,880
He y, calm down.
Calm down both of you.

280
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:11,620
Come on, Vasco. The Swede
didn't mean to offend you.

281
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:18,130
Besides, you called him a
penguin. Now you're even.

282
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,970
If you really want to
fight with him...

283
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,200
...you guys can always do that
when you get back.

284
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:29,030
I'm offering you the opportunity
to earn back your former rank...

285
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,130
...and all the privileges that
go with that rank.

286
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:36,240
Go with him. Help him out.

287
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,850
Never take your e yes off him.

288
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,420
And bring us that bastard, Xantos!

289
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,680
I'm asking you to do it
for your General...

290
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,260
...for your compañeros...

291
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,740
...for our revolution.

292
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,510
- If you insist, okay.
- Long live the revolution!

293
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,110
Doesn't heat like this kill penguins?

294
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,710
Well, it certainly isn't comfortable.

295
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:07,300
Now you can tell me
why you gave me this dollar.

296
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,840
I don't think this is quite
the right moment.

297
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,620
Good morning, Lieutenant.

298
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,720
Who are you?
Where are you going?

299
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,190
My name is Yodlaf Peterson.

300
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:37,260
I'm a Swedish citizen, going to
Hermosillo to get a train to the U.S.

301
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,630
Here's my passport.

302
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,070
Who's he?

303
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,610
He's my servant.

304
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,050
Go ahead, Sergeant.

305
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,980
This is an operational area.

306
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,680
We must photograph and register
everyone who's undocumented.

307
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:00,120
- We're at your disposal.
- Oh, no. It's just for him.

308
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,220
A good system of control.

309
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,860
Okay, Vasco. Let them
take your photograph.

310
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,100
- Take what?
- All right, dismount! Now!

311
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,640
Yes, you. Come on, dismount!

312
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:20,110
Have a little patience, Lieutenant.
He's just an ignorant peasant.

313
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:27,450
Come on, Vasco. It's easy.
Just stand in front of the platoon.

314
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,850
Sure. Sure, sure.

315
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,220
A bit more to your right.

316
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,580
Move to your left. A little more...

317
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:40,220
...still more, more. A little more.

318
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:43,330
There, that's it. Now, don't move.

319
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,800
Ready?

320
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:49,330
One. Two. Three.

321
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,890
You're an idiot!

322
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,530
A widow?

323
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,790
It must be sad for you to
always travel and sleep alone.

324
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:42,860
I'm not alone.
I'm traveling with these.

325
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,960
Your late husband's?

326
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,040
No, they're mine. Stay where
you are and keep your hands up.

327
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,510
- We won't hurt anybody.
- If they don't ask for it!

328
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,080
Nobody move!

329
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,580
Have we arrived?

330
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,290
No, it's a robbery.

331
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,720
We had no other
way of getting money.

332
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,260
But we don't want it for ourselves.

333
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,730
We're not bandits.

334
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,360
We are revolutionaries

335
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,400
And we're fighting for our
country's freedom.

336
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,940
Long live freedom!

337
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:26,140
For a revolutionary, and even
a bitch, but she's not bad looking

338
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,480
What should we do
with those two?

339
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:31,380
The Swedish one, there.
He helped us once.

340
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,650
But the other is one of
Mongo's lieutenants.

341
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,620
- We better shoot him!
- No! Let's hang him instead.

342
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:42,930
No. Professor Xantos
taught us not to use violence.

343
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,760
Killing this bandit without a trial
would just put us on his level.

344
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:52,430
Of course, she's right. The lady is
right, my friends. No violence!

345
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,240
Shut up!

346
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:00,080
Careful. Don't make me
regret being generous.

347
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:06,350
Stop him! Stop him!
He's stealing the train!

348
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:33,080
Penguin! Wait for me!

349
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,890
Penguin!

350
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:00,430
Let's go kill! Compañeros!

351
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,310
Let's go!

352
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:09,480
Let's go to Yuma!
To Yuma! Help me.

353
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:18,160
You son of a bitch!

354
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:41,170
He y John, listen to this.

355
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,950
An unknown Mexican escaped
after brutally murdering eight men.

356
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:49,250
With the help of Yodlaf
Petersen, a Swedish citizen.

357
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,920
There's a reward of 2000 pesos
for the capture of these two men.

358
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:58,060
they were last seen heading for
Texas aboard the train they stole.

359
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,830
What did you say the
Swede's name was?

360
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:08,510
The Swede, Yodlaf Peterson.
Why, do you know him?

361
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:15,450
Do we know him, Marshall?

362
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:23,860
We know him extremely well.

363
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,610
Marshall will signal the
arrival of the train.

364
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,870
Come out, John.

365
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,670
I saw Marshall flying
around over here.

366
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,640
And wherever you go, he goes.

367
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:02,780
Yodlaf! What a nice surprise.

368
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:07,350
- Good to see you again, John.
- The pleasure is all mine.

369
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,460
I never thought you'd get down
off that cross I nailed you to.

370
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,200
But I did, see?

371
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:20,240
John and I got into
serious trouble in Cuba.

372
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:25,310
We sold some defective
merchandise to the rebels.

373
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,310
To save my own life, I had
to blame everything on him.

374
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,290
John, how did you
get out of that mess?

375
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:39,850
I owe it all to Marshall.

376
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,950
He's the only one
that didn't abandon me.

377
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:49,700
He freed me from the nail that
was pinning my flesh to the tree.

378
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:53,710
How? Did he pull the
nail out with his beak?

379
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:59,840
No, he ate my hand off. Look.

380
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:10,950
Well, these things happen.

381
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,360
It was good seeing you again, John.
But I must go now.

382
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,190
You aren't going anywhere.

383
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:20,560
He's yours.

384
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,260
That's enough.

385
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:52,120
they want you dead or alive.

386
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,940
And since I have a choice,
naturally, I favor...

387
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:59,910
...the first solution.

388
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:02,600
You won't hold it against me,
will you?

389
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,910
No. I can take a joke.

390
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:13,650
You stay here and
keep him company...

391
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,630
...up until the final moment, Marshall.

392
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:05,300
Pretty hot, huh?

393
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,910
Vasco, shoot that damn animal!

394
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:22,250
You made him mad. You're a
penguin, you should understand...

395
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,790
...he gets pissed off if
you treat him like that.

396
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,660
Sooner or later...

397
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,520
...every son of a bitch
comes to a brutal end.

398
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,300
Get me down from here!

399
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:38,170
Calm down, calm down.

400
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:44,200
Die in peace. Don't worry.

401
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,040
I will always keep this
as a reminder of you.

402
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:57,720
Damn heat!

403
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:00,330
What about the revolution?

404
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:07,060
What happened to your ideals?
And to your mission with Mongo?

405
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,660
- You want some?
- No, thanks.

406
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:16,880
Xantos! We have to take him to
San Bernardino to open the safe.

407
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:20,210
The Revolution needs
that money, compañero.

408
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,620
You can't get the Professor
out of Fort Yuma by yourself.

409
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:26,310
Help me down, Vasco.

410
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:29,520
Help me down!
I can't take it anymore!

411
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:32,060
Okay, okay. But...

412
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,690
...first...

413
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,400
...you have to swear...

414
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:45,100
...by San Bernardino...

415
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:49,380
...that this is the last time
you'll try to fool me.

416
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:54,180
I swear, by any Saint you want.

417
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,620
Don't go anywhere.

418
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,230
Are you a Catholic?

419
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:08,760
Of course I'm a Catholic.

420
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,960
Quick! Hurry up!

421
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:21,040
Oh, God! Oh, God!

422
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,940
What the hell are you doing?

423
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:27,500
I havevertigo! I'm afraid!
I can't do it! Oh, God!

424
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:29,710
What do you mean,
you havevertigo?

425
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:32,680
Come on, hurry up!
The rope is choking me!

426
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:37,690
I fooled you, huh?

427
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:41,760
Vertigo? Me?

428
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:50,210
Watch this. The hell
with vertigo. Look at this.

429
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,660
Good job, compañero.

430
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:05,090
If you ever come to Sweden,
I'll introduce you to my sister.

431
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:13,330
Beautiful e yes, blue like the sky,
like only you have.

432
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:22,180
Penguin, you're not dead!
Are you? Don't joke!

433
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,180
What about the
revolution? Penguin!

434
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:28,390
Penguin, the blood is
going to my head.

435
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,980
Everything is black! Penguin, help!

436
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,620
The pawn moves, and checkmate.

437
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:41,760
You see, Mr. Rosenbloom?

438
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:47,860
I n chess, even the weakest piece
can win over the stronger pieces.

439
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,530
When one has principles,
every thing is possible.

440
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:55,050
- We appreciate your principles.
- And we're here to help you.

441
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:59,280
We're ready to invest a great
deal of money in your cause.

442
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:04,580
Human nature has often surprised
me with its sudden generosity.

443
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:09,260
But experience has taught me the
rich never lend to the poor...

444
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,230
...without expecting
something in return.

445
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:15,730
We want nothing more
than a guarantee...

446
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:20,500
...that we'll continue to have
what we've always had until now.

447
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:25,510
Recognition of our rights by any new
government coming into power.

448
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:27,200
What do you mean?

449
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:31,580
Sign the ninety-nine year contract
granting us the oil rights...

450
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:35,950
...and we'll help you return to Mexico
and win your revolution.

451
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,320
We have the means to do it.

452
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,630
The Mexican revolution needs
nobody's help to triumph.

453
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,990
Now get out of here!

454
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,870
Your tactics are disgusting.
You make me sick to my stomache.

455
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:30,810
Seventeen. Black.

456
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:37,010
How do you play that?

457
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:42,680
Bet on a number. If it lands on it,
you win thirty-six times your wager.

458
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:44,880
Really?

459
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:46,750
Try it.

460
00:50:57,670 --> 00:50:59,330
That looks good.

461
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:03,570
- Thirteen, red.
- There, there.

462
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,850
- Can I play any number I want?
- Take your choice.

463
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:24,230
- Ninety-nine.
- You can't bet on ninety-nine!

464
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,200
You told me I can
play any number I want!

465
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:38,210
I want ninety-nine, if you don't
play it, I'll shoot you in the ass.

466
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:41,140
But ninety-nine doesn't exist.

467
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:43,140
Didn't you tell me any
number I want?

468
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,940
Please, tell him that
number doesn't exist.

469
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,810
I'll give you a different
number, compañero.

470
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:51,290
The lucky one will win.

471
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,720
There are two of us, right?

472
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:56,860
Then let's bet on number two.

473
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:07,000
But if we lose you tell me why
you gave me that dollar, okay?

474
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:08,330
Right.

475
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:17,040
- What the hell did you say?
- A few magic words to help us.

476
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:22,450
Thirty-three. Black.

477
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:24,250
Sorry for you guys.

478
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:29,330
And I'm sorry for you, buddy.

479
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:33,060
Yeah, this matter could lead
to mortal displeasure.

480
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:43,860
I made a mistake. How stupid of me!
The winning number is two.

481
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:48,310
This is your lucky day.
Let's see. One, two, three...

482
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:51,540
- Thirty-six. Thirty-six dollars.
- Of course.

483
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,690
Gentlemen, the tables
are closed now.

484
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:56,580
Besides, there's suddenly
something wrong with my nose!

485
00:52:56,690 --> 00:53:02,250
I better go take care of it.
Good afternoon, good afternoon.

486
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:05,760
Next time we'll bet on ninety-nine
so we'll win more money.

487
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:08,730
Maybe.

488
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:14,100
That money belongs
to me, sweetie.

489
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:19,240
I n Dallas, you said you needed
it for you Aunt's funeral.

490
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:23,410
I n San Antonio you had to get your
horse out of hock. I n Wichita...

491
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:29,750
Wichita was the best night
ever. Unforgettable!

492
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,830
I'm getting nervous.

493
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:42,560
Compañero, let me introduce
you to Zaira, wonderful Zaira...

494
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:46,930
...amazing Zaira. The only blonde
I know who's blond all over.

495
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:50,630
You're the only Swede I've ever met.
Hopefully, you'll be the last.

496
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:54,470
If I were you, young man,
I'd be keeping better company.

497
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:58,210
This is your chance
for a new experience!

498
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,950
And your moment of glory,
you Latin stud.

499
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:04,650
Ex cuse me, isn't
she your woman?

500
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:07,990
Yes, but these sort of things
we Swedes don't care about.

501
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:13,330
Zaira, I'm going to a meeting.
Keep this young stud with you.

502
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:17,370
This is one chance you don't want
to let slip through your fingers.

503
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:18,990
Leave it to me.

504
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:30,310
You think you can resist me?

505
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,780
I can try.

506
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:39,690
Xantos is very famous.

507
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:44,960
The U.S. has to release him soon
to avoid an international scandal.

508
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,730
If he returns safely to Mexico,
and wins the revolution...

509
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:54,070
...we'll lose our oil concessions.

510
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:57,660
It's a risk we can't afford, John.
We can't let that happen.

511
00:54:57,810 --> 00:54:59,300
You know the fee.

512
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:00,710
Ten thousand dollars...

513
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,980
...to be paid when
the job is done.

514
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,450
But we've brought you a little
pleasure as an advance.

515
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:21,590
avery welcome gift.

516
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:23,960
The job will be done.

517
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,200
John, the Swede is gone!
Someone must've released him.

518
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:34,700
Marshall, you're getting old!

519
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:49,390
- She's blonde everywhere!
- What happened?

520
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:52,390
It was too much of
a shock, I guess.

521
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:57,460
You better take him away. I have
to get to the Fort on time tonight.

522
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:01,470
The Commandant has
invited me to his birthday party.

523
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:06,810
Me and my girls. We are to get in
after dark and out before daylight.

524
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:10,680
To protect the reputation and
prestige of the U.S. Army.

525
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:14,480
I'll help you protect
the prestige of the U.S. Army.

526
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:19,120
He y, what's going on
in your mind, Swede?

527
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:31,330
Sergeant! He y, Sergeant!

528
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,470
Out of the way!

529
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:41,570
- Ah, you're here.
- Good evening, Sergeant.

530
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:46,750
- Same bunch as usual?
- Yes, same as usual.

531
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:50,210
I've never seen her before.

532
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:54,280
That's right. Of course,
I forgot. She's a new one.

533
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:59,160
Let's not waste time. I'll let you try
her when you come see us.

534
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,770
All right, I'll count on it.

535
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:05,270
Open the gate!

536
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:21,480
Squad, attention! Left, face!
Get in step, forward, march!

537
00:57:31,730 --> 00:57:33,360
Here they are.

538
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:36,860
Very well. Finally!

539
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:41,600
Welcome to the Fort, Miss Zaira.
More beautiful than ever.

540
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,370
And you, Captain,
are as gallant as ever.

541
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:51,710
What are you gaping at?
Back to your barracks. Go to bed!

542
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:54,080
Clear theyard, go on!

543
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:56,410
Happy Birthday!

544
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,910
Hurray! Congratulations! Cheers!

545
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:09,390
Jimmy, I understand you have a
very important guest at the Fort.

546
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:11,620
Who, Professor Xantos?

547
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:16,930
He's upstairs. He's an old bookworm,
and not interested in young women

548
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:29,410
Fire! Fire! Hurry, sound the alarm!

549
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,810
Alarm! Hurry up! Get the buckets!

550
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,660
Start forming a chain!
Bring the horses out!

551
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:47,900
Over there, move! Faster! Faster!

552
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,670
Get all of the horses
out of the stalls!

553
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:56,650
Faster, faster!

554
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:03,580
Ex cuse me, sir but we're on fire.

555
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,250
Yes, we sure are, dearie.

556
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:07,350
You don't understand,
the Fort's burning down!

557
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:10,020
- What?
- Fire! It's spreading like crazy!

558
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:12,570
Send for theyuma City
Fire Department, hurry!

559
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:16,530
Attention! Everybody listen!
The fort is on fire!

560
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,370
Evacuate the building. Get out, hurry!
Hurry! Get out, get out!

561
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,100
The alarm! The alarm!

562
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:25,800
The alarm! The alarm!

563
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:32,550
Fire! Fire! The fort is on fire!
Get the water wagons, now!

564
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:35,490
We've got one hell
of a blaze out there!

565
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:46,420
Penguin!

566
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,690
Go to the tank.

567
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:00,370
Zaira!

568
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:04,600
- Where is he?
- Upstairs.

569
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:09,410
- What about the Professor?
- I'll take care of him.

570
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,610
Get outside and
help the others. Hurry!

571
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:16,350
- Wait! Who are you?
- There's no time for explanations.

572
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,300
Your people are waiting
for you, they need you.

573
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:38,850
You must get out of here.

574
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:43,040
I will return to my country legally,
not like an escaped convict...

575
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:46,280
...but like a man who wins
his freedom without violence.

576
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:48,860
Sometimes you have to
use violence, Professor.

577
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:54,860
No! Give me just one case
where violence is necessary.

578
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:57,760
This one.

579
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:08,780
What happened? Where's
the water? Damn it!

580
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,400
I'll fill up the tank, Sergeant!

581
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:16,450
Okay, but hurry up! Move on!
Faster! Let's fight this fire!

582
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:20,210
Go, horse! Move, move!

583
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:34,000
Vasco, come here! Take him.

584
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,230
He weighs a ton.

585
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:47,350
Stuff him all the way in.
Keep stuffing. Keep stuffing.

586
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:55,290
Only women like you are
good for something. Thanks.

587
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:57,480
Come on, horse. Move it!

588
01:03:57,590 --> 01:03:59,030
He y, wait!

589
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,060
Bye, blondie!

590
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:09,870
Things are going our way.

591
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:13,530
Now It'll be easier to get Xantos.

592
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:07,860
How do you feel, Professor?

593
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:16,630
I think he's mute. He hasn't said
a word since we left the Fort.

594
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:27,740
Professor, why are those idiots
so anxious to get killed for you?

595
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,750
What the hell do you tell them?

596
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:39,620
Tell us what you tell them,
and see how we react.

597
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:49,530
I bet the poor mute
man is also deaf.

598
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:54,070
No, he can hear and speak.
Just not quite the way you do.
