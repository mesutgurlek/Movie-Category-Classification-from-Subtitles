[ Kisses ]

165
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:03,661
Your folks get in all right?

166
00:13:03,771 --> 00:13:06,501
[ Sighs ]
They're actually already here.

167
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:08,041
I'm late?

168
00:13:08,142 --> 00:13:10,872
And I'm the wife who didn't make supper?

169
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:13,004
Your ma's gonna have
something to say about that.

170
00:13:13,114 --> 00:13:15,082
[ Clark ]
Oh, she'll be fine. Don't worry about her.

171
00:13:15,183 --> 00:13:17,879
- You all washed up?
- Yes, ma'am. Pa made me.

172
00:13:17,986 --> 00:13:20,250
Then what are we waiting on?
Let's go eat.

173
00:13:20,355 --> 00:13:22,915
- So, how was your first day?
- I enjoy working with Sarah.

174
00:13:23,024 --> 00:13:25,288
- Yeah?
- You know she's a widow.

175
00:13:25,393 --> 00:13:26,519
Yeah.

176
00:13:26,628 --> 00:13:29,256
- You know Ben's a widower.
- Mm-hmm?

177
00:13:29,364 --> 00:13:32,231
- Yeah, he has two kids too.
- Mm-hmm.

178
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,267
Ellen, don't get any ideas.

179
00:13:34,369 --> 00:13:36,132
Well, hello, Lloyd.

180
00:13:36,237 --> 00:13:38,535
Ellen. Oh! So good to see you.

181
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,608
- It is so good to see you.
- [ Chuckles ]

182
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,608
Look at you.

183
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,110
- How was your trip in?
- Oh, not bad. Not bad at all.

184
00:13:45,213 --> 00:13:49,309
I do have to admit though.
The old back does need a good night's rest.

185
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,220
Irene, it is so wonderful to see you.

186
00:13:56,324 --> 00:13:57,552
Ellen.

187
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:00,059
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- I understand you're working.

188
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:01,958
I am. Today was my first day.

189
00:14:02,063 --> 00:14:04,657
You know, in my time,
a woman really wouldn't...

190
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:07,394
- Mwah!
- Oh, my! [ Laughs ]

191
00:14:07,502 --> 00:14:09,470
- Stop.
- What do you say we eat?

192
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,697
- Just go sit down.
- [ Chuckling ]

193
00:14:17,211 --> 00:14:19,441
Are you sure you're gonna be okay
staying in town?

194
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:22,880
Oh, my, yes.
We don't wanna impose.

195
00:14:22,984 --> 00:14:24,781
[ Gasps ]

196
00:14:24,886 --> 00:14:28,049
I almost forgot.
I brought you something.

197
00:14:29,223 --> 00:14:31,123
I'll be here in the morning.

198
00:14:31,225 --> 00:14:33,955
- No, Pa, you don't have to do that.
- Now, look, look...

199
00:14:34,062 --> 00:14:37,361
I've been around long enough to know
that if the wife has to take a job...

200
00:14:37,465 --> 00:14:40,059
things aren't going as
well as they could be.

201
00:14:41,803 --> 00:14:44,567
- 8:00?
- I'll be here.

202
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,134
There.

203
00:14:47,241 --> 00:14:49,971
She's beautiful, Grandma. I love her.

204
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:52,808
- Thank you.
- Oh, good. I'm so glad.

205
00:14:52,914 --> 00:14:55,178
- Look, Mom.
- She's lovely.

206
00:14:55,283 --> 00:14:58,309
Thank you. I made her special for you.

207
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:01,616
I will keep her with me always.
Thank you so much, Grandma.

208
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,016
Oh!

209
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,025
Pa, look what Grandma made for me.

210
00:15:06,127 --> 00:15:09,995
- I see that. What's her name gonna be?
- I don't know. I just got her.

211

[ All Laughing ]

212
00:15:13,067 --> 00:15:16,127
Come on. We better get going.
It's a long way into town.

- Mm.
- Mm.

216
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,098
Just give me a little bit more time.

00:15:52,206 --> 00:15:54,071
I'm so tired.

218
00:15:54,175 --> 00:15:56,075
I'd let you sleep as long as you'd like...

00:15:56,177 --> 00:15:58,236
but as soon as l do,
the rooster you hate so much...

[ Crowing ]

223
00:16:07,155 --> 00:16:09,680
One of these days, you're gonna come back
from working in the field...

224
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,316
and you're gonna find
that rooster's your supper.

[ Both Laughing ]

226
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:18,124
Just give me a little more time to sleep.

- I'm so tired.
- Okay.

we'll wake you when we come back.

- Go back to sleep.
- Mmm.

232
00:16:41,756 --> 00:16:45,590
Son, why didn't you tell us
you were having trouble with the land?

233
00:16:45,693 --> 00:16:48,127
A man's gotta stand on his own.

234
00:16:48,229 --> 00:16:50,254
I didn't wanna come begging for help.

235
00:16:50,364 --> 00:16:53,959
Yep, a man does have to go off and...

236
00:16:54,068 --> 00:16:56,866
find his way, make his own life.

237
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:59,633
But he shouldn't forget where he come from.

238
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,072
I didn't want you to think
l couldn't take care of my family.

Son, l would never.

240
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:09,277
- So, how long has this well been dry anyway?
- It's been a spell.

241
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:13,319
Just had enough for the garden
and the animals from the creek.

242
00:17:13,421 --> 00:17:16,913
But... it's been
barely enough to sustain us.

243
00:17:17,024 --> 00:17:20,425
Well, have you tried
digging a little deeper into the well?

244
00:17:22,096 --> 00:17:25,122
Yes, sir, but... l hit rock.

Yeah, well, l noticed you, uh...

246
00:17:28,603 --> 00:17:31,766
you dug another one out in the field
in front of the house.

- Yes, sir, same problem.
- Well, l think l may know of a way...

248
00:17:35,343 --> 00:17:39,143
to get you some water without having
to dig wells all over creation.

249
00:17:40,681 --> 00:17:43,673
Your old man knows a thing or two
about dealing with a drought.

What do you think, hmm?

Oh, it's beautiful.

You are truly an artist.

- Can l ask you something, Sarah?
- Certainly.

255
00:18:02,803 --> 00:18:06,830
- Your husband, he passed on a couple of years back.
- Yes.

256
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:09,068
He's still in your heart?

257
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:13,444
He will always be in my heart.

258
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:17,017
What l meant was...

259
00:18:17,118 --> 00:18:19,678
do you ever see yourself
with somebody else?

260
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:21,778
Remarrying, l mean?

261
00:18:22,957 --> 00:18:25,118
At first l didn't.

262
00:18:25,226 --> 00:18:28,195
No, the pain was so strong.

263
00:18:28,296 --> 00:18:30,730
I couldn't imagine a time...

264
00:18:30,831 --> 00:18:34,267
when l could be open to someone else.

265
00:18:34,368 --> 00:18:37,997
But time has a way of changing things
without you knowing.

266
00:18:38,105 --> 00:18:41,666
[ Laughs ]
it took some time, but, uh...

267
00:18:41,776 --> 00:18:45,678
l think the Lord has allowed
my aching heart to heal.

Ben Graham lost his wife.

He's a good man, a good father.

270
00:18:55,923 --> 00:18:59,689
And he is a rather
handsome man, l must say.

271
00:19:03,264 --> 00:19:07,496
So you said your well is,
what, about 25 feet?

272
00:19:07,601 --> 00:19:11,002
Well, l was able to dig five more,
but then l ended up hitting rock.

273
00:19:11,105 --> 00:19:14,541
All right, so that's about 30.

274
00:19:14,642 --> 00:19:20,103
I figure, uh, this land
being more elevated like it is...

275
00:19:20,214 --> 00:19:22,910
we'll have to go down about 40, 45 feet...

00:19:23,017 --> 00:19:25,076
in order to even have a
hope of hittin' water.

That deep, huh?

- Yeah?

Well, then you make her stay home

That other people can get sick too?

She's a little girl,

- ls she still upset?
- Of course.

She wants to help her mother

You shouldn't be taxing

won't let you see her, huh?

They won't let me do anything.

about you gettin' sick, pumpkin.

- Pa's in there all the time.
- I know.

But that's what your pa is here for.

to collect our things and check out.

[ Sighs ] Ma, will you take
Missy inside for a minute?

Everything all right?

642
00:47:52,992 --> 00:47:54,687
Just take her inside.

643
00:47:55,594 --> 00:47:57,061
Yes, dear.

644
00:47:58,964 --> 00:48:03,298
Now- [ Sighs ]
l know this is a difficult time.

645
00:48:03,402 --> 00:48:08,305
But, uh, this is rather a discreet matter.

646
00:48:08,407 --> 00:48:10,637
I'm his pa.

647
00:48:10,743 --> 00:48:13,075
Whatever you need to say,
you can say it in front of me.

648
00:48:13,179 --> 00:48:15,647
All right.

649
00:48:15,748 --> 00:48:18,046
Now, you're well aware
that you went for some time...

650
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:20,812
without making a payment on your loan.

651
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,947
Then Mrs. Davis took a job in town
and you were able to make one payment.

652
00:48:26,058 --> 00:48:28,686
Now, with her passing...

653

l need to know how you intend
to repay your debt.

My wife passed only days ago,
and you're gonna come to me with this?

655

I cannot let this continue...

how the bank will be repaid.

Now, quite frankly...

be able to make even the next payment...

659

- Yeah, that's true enough.

But I'm more interested
in what that banker said.

671

I mean, you told us that
you had money problems, but...

to pay back that money, plain and simple.

Plus, l know you and Ma
are struggling to get by too.

Yeah, that's the truth.

678

You know that if we had the money we'd be
giving it to you straightaway.

- What were you thinking?
- I was just trying to help.

To help? Burning the house...

But it was my fault.
I was the one that left her.

Yeah, she's fine.
But you got me to thinking...

1115
01:23:10,307 --> 01:23:13,868
the people we love can be
taken from us at any time.

1116

You and l, we-
we know that better than most.

I suppose we do.

taking things slow, but, um...

What is it?

Uh- Ben, l was not expecting this.

1127
01:23:42,506 --> 01:23:45,270
Neither was l.
