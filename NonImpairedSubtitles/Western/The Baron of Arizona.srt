1
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:21,468
Gentlemen,
to the state of Arizona.

2
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,474
( All )
To Arizona.

3
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,579
That's good, Governor.

4
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,445
The state of Arizona.

5
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,486
I kind of like the sound of it.

6
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:37,215
I'm glad I lived to see this day.

7
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,917
- Mr. Griff?
- No, thank you, Governor.

8
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:43,325
- Mmm. Choice Havanas.
- I'll smoke this one.

9
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,659
Well, you must have something
very special there.

10
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:48,632
- Very special.
- Are you writing any more books,John?

11
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:52,728
No. That was just
a sideline with me.

12
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,536
I've been working with
the Department of Interior all these years.

13
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,112
A friend of mine gave me this cigar.

14
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,549
A celebration for him too.

15
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,619
His 30th wedding anniversary.

16
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:12,855
Gentlemen,
I'd like to propose a toast...

17
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,856
to a real lover of Arizona --

18
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,964
to my friend...

19
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:23,035
James Addison Reavis.

20
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,567
The man who called himself
the Baron of Arizona?

21
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:35,137
Yes. He will always be a part
of the Arizona legend.

22
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,579
Were it not for him,
perhaps you gentlemen...

23
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,746
would not have formed your senatorial
committee on statehood...

24
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,755
as fervidly as you did.

25
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,121
Oh, yes.
I remember that cheap swindler.

26
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:51,095
Swindler? Yes.

27
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,097
But cheap?

28
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,999
Oh, there was nothing cheap
aboutJames Reavis.

29
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:02,301
You only remember what you read
in the papers, Mr. Reynolds.

30
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,400
But I don't understand, Mr. Griff.
Uh, he's your friend?

31
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,411
<i>Yes.</i>

32
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,481
I always thought
you were bitter enemies.

33
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,880
On the contrary, Governor...

34
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,920
it was a challenge
to have such a man as an adversary.

35
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:19,789
He put up a most magnificent fight
against the government.

36
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:23,123
What on earth made him dream up
such a fantastic swindle?

37
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,562
Ambition.

38
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:32,402
Wasn't he a clerk
in the Santa Fe land office at one time?

39
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,405
Yes, he was...

40
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:37,806
and it infuriated him
that ignorant people inherited land...

41
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,347
because the United States
recognized Spanish grants.

42
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,817
So he decided to steal Arizona
with forged documents.

43
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,945
<i>( Man ) Didn't he spend many years</i>
<i>perfecting his plan?</i>

44
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:53,025
<i>Yes. Many years.</i>

45
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,687
He studied ancient records
and learned to forge them.

46
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,821
He studied languages.

47
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:02,389
He adopted the manners
of a gentleman of culture...

48
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:06,131
knowing all these things
were necessary to his scheme.

49
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:11,568
He created a man
called Miguel de Peralta...

50
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,146
the first Baron of Arizona.

51
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:19,075
He was now ready
to put his plan in motion.

52
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,317
One rainy night in 1 872...

53
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,392

Yes!

59
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,549

Mmm.

Uh, would you like a good Havana?

72
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,101
- I do not smoke.
- Oh.

73
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:46,103
Mr. Alvarez, uh...

74
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,174
the government of the United States
is a very fair government.

75
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,266
You know that.

76
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:55,313
It recognizes Spanish titles
to land grants.

77
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,213
- Do you know what a land grant is?
- Yes.

78
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:03,149
Well, it seems that back in 1 7 48...

79
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:07,056
the King of Spain
gave to Miguel de Peralta...

80
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,458
a grant of land in America.

81
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,463
- Did you ever hear of Peralta?
- No.

82
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,556
He was the first Baron of Arizona.

83
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:17,067
Baron? In America?

84
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,537
Yes. And according to the laws
of this country...

85
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,303
his direct descendant
is the rightful heir to the Peralta grant.

86
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,537
The heir?

87
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,911
( Chuckling )
Oh, yes. That means that the person...

88
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,916
related to him today...

89
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,918

90
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,917
What has this to do with Sofia?

91
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,722
Her real name is Sofia de Peralta.

92

-<i>( Thunder Rumbling )</i>
- <i>Here are the papers to prove it.</i>

Read it.

96
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,620
I do not read.

97
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:16,525
Well, according to these papers,
she is the last of the Peraltas.

- Ah.
- I make family for Sofia too.

Yes. But he was happy for the child.

New Year's in the Painted Desert.

162
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,199
Christmas in the Gila Valley.

163
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,673
And Thanksgiving
in the Pine Timber.

164
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,745
And the Grand Canyon --

165
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:02,643
the Grand Canyon
will be your play yard.

166
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:06,514
That's a real birthday present, Sofia,
from the United States.

167
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,884
Over 1 1 3,000 square miles --
as large as Italy--

168
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,825
and it's all yours --

169
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:18,021
every mile, every foot, every inch.

170
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:23,130
I promise you this birthright, Sofia.

171
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,600
Are you going away for a long time?

172
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:31,074
There are many important documents
to gather so that you can inherit all this.

173
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,145
Can't you do it here?

174
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,213
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

175
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,282
Then I do not want it!

176
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,751
What did Aristotle say of dignity?

177
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,622
He said, ''Dignity consists...

178
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:52,527
not in possessing honors,
but in deserving them.''

179
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:56,465
- And?
- And I shall try to deserve them.

180
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,902
Good. You and I must never
lose our bearings, Sofia...

181
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,235
not even for an instant.

182
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,770
- ( Crying )
- You must have dignity. Only peasants cry.

183
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,906
I know, but I want to go with you!
I want to go with you!

184
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,382
I want to go with you!
( Crying )

185
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,049
- I want to go with you!
- You are Sofia de Peralta, Baroness of Arizona.

186
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,182
Say it!

187
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:24,092
( Crying )
I -- I am Sofia de Peralta...

188
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,994
Baroness of Arizona.

189
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,400
<i>( Griff Narrating ) He then</i>
<i>established evidence of Sofia's birth...</i>

190
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,406
<i>and falsified records...</i>

191
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:39,875
<i>creating for her an entire family</i>
<i>of noble blood</i>--

192
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:43,642
<i>the family of one Miguel de Peralta.</i>

193
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:46,809
<i>And before the ink</i>
<i>certifying them was dry...</i>

194
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:50,150
<i>he falsified the existence</i>
<i>ofher parents...</i>

195
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:54,454
<i>and carefully arranged</i>
<i>to have them properly laid to rest.</i>

196
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:18,377
<i>Having provided Sofia</i>
<i>with the necessary ancestry...</i>

197
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:22,386
<i>he sailed for Spain</i>
<i>to complete his worldwide forgery.</i>

198
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:34,893
<i>He had only one more act to perform</i>--

199
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,901
<i>falsification of</i>
<i>the original land grant book...</i>

200
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,130
<i>of Ferdinand VI...</i>

201
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,935
<i>which was in</i>
<i>the well-guarded archives</i>--

202
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:46,944
<i>the biblioteca</i>
<i>in the monastery of Alcántara.</i>

203
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,666
- The Father Guardian will see you now.
- Oh, thank you, Brother.

204
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,878
- Have you come for a short visit?
- I have come to stay.

205
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:08,025
Oh, uh, forgive me, Father.

206
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,755
I mean I -- I would like
to stay very much.

207
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,162
Hmm. But why have you
chosen our order?

208
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:19,866
Well, I have made careful survey, Father,
and from the little I know of your order...

209
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,940
I feel very much attracted to it.

210
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,940
There is much to prove
before you can join our order.

211
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:30,072
<i>After all,you must admit</i>
<i>we know nothing about you.</i>

212
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:34,949
Charity commands us
to accept you on your face value...

213
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:39,354
but for practical purposes,
you will have sufficient time to prove yourself.

214
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,926
By the time you are through
with your novitiate...

215
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,995
we will know more about you.

216
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:56,340
Oh, Brother Anthony,
welcome to the library of Alcántara.

217
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,240
I'm Brother Gregory, the custodian.
May I assist you?

218
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,312
Oh, thank you, Brother Gregory.

219
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,472
This is our scriptorium...

220
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,449
where we study
and do most of our spiritual work.

221
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,386
It's very interesting.

222
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:12,924
We have a fine collection of books
which you will enjoy.

223
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,494
The scribe room...

224
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:21,464
where our experts copy
and illuminate manuscripts.

225
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,127
The illumination is magnificent.

226
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,136
And the calligraphy!

227
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,677
The repair room...

228
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,713
where we strengthen
and sew bindings.

229
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,942
- Is this for sewing the bindings?
- Yes, that's right.

230
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,781
- And the, uh, press?
- Yes, the press.

231
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,758
Uh, those are cakes of ink.

232
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,760
Yes, we make our own ink...

233
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:53,093
and have not changed the formula
in five centuries.

234
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,135
And this is our biblioteca.

235
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,968
This is where we preserve
our ancient books...

236
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,204
and, uh, priceless records.

237
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,780
Oh.
( Chuckles )

238
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,442
You are surprised
to find them chained?

239
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,451
I can understand.

240
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,522
But to remove a book
is strictly forbidden.

241
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:20,421
- But surely no one would dare.
- Well, who knows?

242
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:24,485
Once a rare book collector
acted rather strangely in this cell...

243
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:27,087
and we were compelled to summon
the civil police from Seville...

244
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,895
to investigate him.

245
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,266
The Mazarin Bible...

246
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:36,432
the first work of Gutenberg
printed in 1 450.

247
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:40,273
- I thought it was in two volumes.
- You're right, Brother Anthony.

248
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:43,348
Christopher Columbus's son
borrowed the second volume...

249
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,882
and, uh, never returned it.

250
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,884
( Chuckles )

251
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:51,922
The books and, uh, records
are listed.

252
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,152
- You're welcome at all times.
- Thank you, Brother Gregory.

253
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,078
( Chain Rattling )

254
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:10,462
<i>( Griff Narrating ) He lost no time</i>
<i>stealing ammonia from the infirmary...</i>

255
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,697
<i>and milk and meal</i>
<i>from the kitchen.</i>

256
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:17,104
<i>He mixed a solution</i>
<i>and tried it out.</i>

257
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:20,178
<i>He had to make sure</i>
<i>he could remove the ink.</i>

258
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:38,693
<i>He rubbed the surface of the page</i>
<i>with pumice...</i>

259
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,027
<i>to smooth the irritated grain.</i>

260
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,438
<i>That night he gathered his equipment</i>
<i>and hurried to the biblioteca...</i>

261
00:21:56,548 --> 00:22:01,008
<i>to forge the Peralta grant</i>
<i>in the 1 7 48 volume.</i>

262
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,006
( Grunts )

263
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,906
<i>This was his first major catastrophe.</i>

264
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,240
But he never admitted defeat.

265
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:04,941
For months he practiced
ancient penmanship.

266
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,814
For months he made attempts
to enter the biblioteca...

267
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,149
while the others were asleep.

268
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,223
But he failed.

269
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,325
One day, however...

270
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:18,396
he conceived a simple
but most effective plan...

271
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:22,797
<i>of gaining entry into the biblioteca</i>
<i>where he could work.</i>

272
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:27,167
<i>In his cell, he deliberately left</i>
<i>a sample ofhis penmanship.</i>

273
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:31,901
<i>( Bell Tolling )</i>

274
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:54,523
- Brother Anthony, did you write this?
- Yes, Father.

275
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,932
I'm assigning you to the library
to assist Brother Gregory.

276
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:01,335
- I prefer field work.
- You've been here three years.

277
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,409
You're a hard worker,
but your talent would be wasted.

278
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:07,945
- But, Father, I --
- I suggest you go to the library.

279
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,980
Yes, Father.

280
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:32,534
And this is our biblioteca...

281
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,970
where we preserve our ancient books
and priceless records.

282
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:39,568
- To remove one of the books --
- Brother Anthony.

283
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:43,307
Yes, Father.
The books and documents are listed.

284
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,609
Will you get the land grant records
of 1 7 48, please?

285
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:17,348
Yes, the binding must be repaired.

286
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:20,009
I wonder what condition
the other copy is in.

287
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,988
No, you may keep the keys.

288
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,423
Brother Gregory is ill,
but will be well tomorrow.

289
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,792
You are custodian
of the library for tonight.

290
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:35,458
When Brother Paul has finished repairing
the binding, be sure to return the book.

291
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,933
Yes, Father Guardian.
Oh, Father Guardian.

292
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,004
Yes?

293
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:43,472
Is there another copy
of such a valuable book?

294
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:46,942
The 1 7 50 volume.
It was written here.

295
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,104
But the Marqués de Santella has it.

296
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,978
He is secretary to the king.

297
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,051
Are you ill?

298
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,955
No, Father.

299
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,049
I was just thinking of the book.

300
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,095
<i>I understand your concern</i>
<i>for ancient documents...</i>

301
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,096
but do not despair.

302
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:10,167
They're well preserved
in his castle near Madrid.

303
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:38,481
Oh, I came here to the archive...

304
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:42,048
to seek peace within myself, Father.

305
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,219
You are tempted to run away.

306
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,466
I am not for this kind of life, Father.

307
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,136
Others have been tempted too.

308
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:56,933
Meditate.

309
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,010
We shall talk tomorrow.

310
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,849
( Sighs )

311
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:33,637
You know how it is, Father.
There are so many reports, so many complaints.

312
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:36,942
<i>But in your case, we came</i>
<i>just as soon as we were notified.</i>

313
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,677
I'm glad you came today. I --

314
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,946

<i>Brother Anthony.!</i>

317
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,012
Brother Anthony!

318
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,475
I did not think he would run away.

319
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:18,522
Run away? The wagon.
He has taken our horses and wagon.

320
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:22,024
- We'll bring them back.
- That's not the way.

321
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:25,153
He would not speak to me
for fear I would inspire him to stay.

322
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,993
Yes, he did appear frightened.

323
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,033
As I was telling you, Father...

324
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:33,104
your complaints
finally brought official action.

325
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:36,139
Tomorrow all holes
in the mountain roads will be filled...

326
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,209
even those beyond the Roman Bridge.

<i>( Man Laughing )</i>

329
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,162
Some wine, Father.

330
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:38,861
Your horse is dead, Father,
your wagon firewood.

331
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,803
I found you -- me, Rita.

332
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:44,534
I'm not a monk, Rita.

333
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,336
To escape police,
I had to wear this robe.

334
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,508
Who are you?

335
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:55,814
A wanderer, like Cain,
looking for a woman of my own.

336
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,653
( All Laughing )

337
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:06,855
I tell you, she was beautiful...

338
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:10,526
but I told her that a Spanish promise
is like a Spanish pepper.

339
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,603
It burns whoever tastes it.

340
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,940
- Here's a hat.
- Oh, thank you, Angie.

341
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,008
- And here's a coat.
- Ah.

342
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:20,475
- I think this will fit you.
- Ah, thanks.

343
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:23,445
What's the matter? Aren't you gonna
finish the stew I made for you?

344
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:27,780
- Oh, certainly, Angie. It's excellent.
- It's your horses.

345
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:35,386
Two years ago in Madrid
I was dining with royalty one night.

346
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:37,984
One of them said
that no amount of washing...

347
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,792
could turn a gypsy white.

348
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,995
- <i>I accused him of insulting the gypsies.</i>
- <i>You said that to a nobleman?</i>

349
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:48,368
I spit in his face
and received 20 lashes on my back.

350
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:51,374
That pig of a nobleman
was the Marqués de Santella.

351
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,603
Santella? Secretary to the king?

352
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:56,612
He's a pig.
He prays every night to the devil.

353
00:31:56,714 --> 00:32:00,480
- He's rich.
- I know, and I have a plan.

354
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:04,453
In his house is much gold.
I know exactly where it is hidden.

355
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:08,013
But I need help,
and we can all share in that great wealth.

356
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:11,220
- It's too dangerous.
- She is right.

357
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,991
A thief never takes chances.
We can get that gold.

358
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,999
- Then why do you need us?
- I told you, I have a plan.

359
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,696
As it is, they chase us like dogs
from one province to another.

360
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,898
<i>Madrid.!</i>

361
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:27,239
The marqués would order
half of Spain to hunt us down.

362
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:30,007
Does a girl make decisions for you?

363
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,674
She has a man's shrewdness.

364
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,412
A shrewd woman would know
when to trust a man.

365
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,216
Well, why should we trust you?

366
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:43,022
We don't know who you really are
or... where you come from.

367
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,763
Tomorrow you leave our camp!

368
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,993
I told you to leave tomorrow!

369
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,428
Take me with you.
I want to go with you.

370
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:27,537
I will not be in the way.
I will be good to you.

371
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:31,767
I will be very friendly.

372
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,969
- Perhaps.
- You will take me?

373
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:36,171
Yes.

374
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,374
Yes, I can see you
in Paris, London, America...

375
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:42,817
everybody bowing to you,
treating you like a lady.

376
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,286
( Chuckles )
But you'll marry one of your own...

377
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,688
and have many dirty-faced children.

378
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:50,886
No, no, no, no, no.

379
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:55,728
But you can't leave your people, Rita.
They depend on you. They listen to you.

380
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,733
I hate them.

381
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:07,636
Oh, Rita, you're like
a rich curtain before a doorway...

382
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:10,976
of wild, wonderful miracles.

383
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,050
There is no longer a curtain.

384
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,855
Each band is a sin...

385
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,120
and I want to confess them
all to you.

386
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:25,184
You make it very hard to refuse.

387
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:28,732
I've known many women, but with you
it's different. With you I'm afraid.

388
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:33,497
Is it true what you said?
That no washing will turn a gypsy white?

389
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,504
It takes money.

390
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:41,934
It's all yours. Money I've saved,
stolen, hidden from the others.

391
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:44,071
I hate living in the woods
like an animal...

392
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:46,548
people spitting at me
and treating me like a mongrel.

393
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:49,245
- It's not enough for what we both want.
- Then we shall get more.

394
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:52,686
The Marqués de Santella
has much gold.

395
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,816
Enough to dress you in fine gowns
and take you far away from here.

396
00:34:55,927 --> 00:35:00,193
Anything! Anything you say!
Only promise you'll take me with you.

397
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:11,366
I don't understand Rita.

398
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,376
Last night...

399
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:18,943
she said it was too dangerous
to go to Madrid.

400
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,054
Today she says we go to Madrid.

401
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:28,057
Mm-hmm.

402
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:32,486
I don't like
this moving around all the time!

403
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,929
It makes me feel like a vagabond.

Where is the tall gypsy?
The one with the lovely beard.

406
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,988
Ah, Marquesa,
I see a rich, fat man in your life.

407
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,184
My husband is not a fat man.

408
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,318
The Marqués de Santella
is a handsome man.

409

Oh, yes, Marquesa, he is beautiful.

410
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,430
It was because of me
that he permitted this party.

411
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:13,936
Unless you bring me the tall gypsy at once,
I'll have you driven off.

412
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:17,839
No, wait. I thought I saw him
go into the house.

413
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,467
No. He's in the woods...

414
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:22,637
making a love potion for you.

415
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,043
- I think he's in the house.
- No.

416
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,618
He's waiting for you in the woods.
He told me.

What are you doing here?

418
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:23,136
The gypsy girl told me
that you would be here.

419
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,334
She lied. She's jealous.

420
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,343
And so am I.

421
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:30,676
Last night you promised you'd spend
every moment with me tonight.

422
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:32,681
We must be cautious.
Your husband.

423
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:36,082
I love my husband,
but I'm bored with him...

424
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:39,088
and his musty, old books.

425
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,715
Only a fool would waste his time
on old books...

426
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:44,624

young woman to love.

Please, don't leave with the others.

Stay here in Madrid

a woman as wife when he loves her.

- Don't you believe that I love her?
- I do not mean it that way.

00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,593
Call the lucky little mother.

469
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:33,096
Call her.

470
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:35,859
<i>Sofia.</i>

471
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:37,866
<i>Sofia.</i>

472
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:57,279
Well, aren't you happy to see me?

473
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,921
I cannot see you for the tears.

474
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:15,702
Are my cheeks <i>fl</i>ushed?
You can't see in the dark.

475
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,774
I'm so excited.

476
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:22,137
Did you notice my necklace?
You sent it from Mexico.

477
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:25,443
- And the comb -- do you remember?
- From Sevilla.

478
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:28,677
The one I like best is --
is the music box from --

479
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:31,880
From, uh, Madrid.
( Chuckles )

480
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,618
Sofia, how does it feel
to be a woman of dignity...

481
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:38,695
and -- and beauty?

482
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:41,697
Why don't you ask
how it feels to be lonely?

483
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:44,063
You too?

484
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,966
All my life, I've known two men<i>:</i>

485
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:50,234
the one who came out of the rain
in the long black cape...

486
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,536
the other one
who is always in my dreams.

487
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:56,443
Sofia...

488
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,947
am I too old for your affections?

489
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:00,949
Too old?

490
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,314
I am grateful to have learned
in all my travels...

491
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,481
what so few women ever learn<i>:</i>

492
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,491
how to recognize love.

493
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:13,026
I could never explain why...

494
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,496
but...

495
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,432
it would fill my heart
if you would become my wife.

496
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:25,569
Oh, I've --
I've wanted it this way...

497
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:28,144
ever since I realized what I wanted.

498
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:36,815
Oh, Sofia, Sofia.

499
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:41,655
I have know many, many women...

500
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,560
but with you...

501
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,567
I'm afraid.

502
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,007
Hey, that's a pretty fancy carriage.

503
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:08,710
Well, now we'll see
what a baron looks like.

504
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:52,386
<i>( Knocking )</i>

505
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,396
<i>( Man )</i>
<i>Come in.</i>

506
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:07,138
- I am the Baron of Arizona.
- Howdy, Baron.

507
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:09,144
I'm Miller, Surveyor General.

508
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:12,841
Oh, may I present, Mr. Miller, my wife,
the Baroness Sofia de Peralta-Reavis.

509
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,009
How do you do, Baroness? Um --

510
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,522
We wish to claim full recognition
of the Peralta land grant.

511
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:24,990
<i>There's, uh, been quite a lot of excitement</i>
<i>in town since your man told us you were coming.</i>

512
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:27,928
Royalty is something new in Arizona.

513
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:32,230
Our agents have collected the necessary
copies of all certified documents.

514
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,703
The royal decree
signed by Ferdinand VI.

515
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:38,274
<i>The history of the Peraltas.</i>

516
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,275
<i>The petition.</i>

517
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:48,818
Are you sure the metes and bounds
i-in this location are, uh --

518
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:52,514
- I am.
- But there must be some mistake.

519
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,591
Why, this grant, uh --

520
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:59,459
Why, i-it takes in practically
the entire territory of Arizona.

521
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:01,463
It does take in the territory.

522
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:06,002
It also includes all mineral rights,
all rivers...

523
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:08,071
<i>all grazing ground.</i>

524
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:12,370
I'd advise you to investigate
this claim at once, Mr. Miller...

525
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:14,637
for you are living on our land.

526
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:17,145
Good day, sir.

527
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:32,796
<i>( Clicking Continues )</i>

528
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:40,199
According to your records of 1 7 50...

529
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:43,000
a stone marker would prove
a definite location.

530
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:46,076
And evidence that Peralta
actually took possession.

531
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,303
Well, maybe.

532
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,347
This is pretty wild country
around here.

533
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:53,575
There is no stone.

534
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:55,811
If you say so, Mr. Miller.

535
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,888
<i>Mr. Miller.! Mr. Miller.! Mr. Miller.!</i>

536
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:35,014
Peralta. Peralta. Peralta!

537
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,593
This man Reavis
claims to own everything...

538
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:40,458
from the smallest shack
to the capitol in Prescott!

539
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:43,692
If the land belongs to him,
the sooner the people know it, the better.

540
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,065
Why? So they'll be saved court costs?

541
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:49,606
Mr. Secretary, we're whipped.

542
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,514
Gentlemen...

543
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:03,518
because of the Peralta grant...

544
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,747
the New Mexico-Arizona boundary...

545
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:07,824
has just been altered.

546
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:13,061
Congress has refused
the territory of New Mexico...

547
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:17,099
admission as a state to the union...

548
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:20,637
until the Reavis bounds
are clarified by us.

549
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:28,643
Well, Griff, what about
the signatures on these documents?

550
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:30,679
This is a good Havana...

551
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:34,376
but very often a fine wrapper
conceals inferior tobacco.

552
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:37,078
You're the greatest expert
in the country.

553
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:45,020
Are these papers forged?

554
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,373
I think so.
Now, now, now, don't get excited.

555
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:08,447
Why should a land office clerk
finance a child's education...

556
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,146
when he could have bought the grant
from her for a few dollars...

557
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:13,723
and claimed it for himself?

558
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:16,486
- Why did he marry her?
- Well, why?

559
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:19,824
To protect himself.

560
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,228
As long as a true Spaniard
inherits the land...

561
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:24,960
he knows the government
will not violate the treaty.

562
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:38,244
Gentlemen,
it has the stench of swindle.

563
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:40,441
The signatures on these papers
appear authentic...

564
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:43,519
but they're still only copies.

565
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,748
Well, Griff, what do you suggest?

566
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:51,727
To examine the original source
upon which this claim is founded --

567
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:55,059
in the monastery
of Alcántara in Spain.

568
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:08,169
- <i>( Knocking )</i>
- <i>Come in.</i>

569
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:11,806
- Sir, the president of--
- <i>I am occupied.</i>

570
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:16,418
Not too occupied to see Gunther
of Southern Railroad.

571
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,420
<i>( Door Closes )</i>

572
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:20,490
Say!

573
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:24,794
Well!

574
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:29,898
I've sent word to you more than once
to come to my office.

575
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,332
Your manners
are as impossible, sir...

576
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:36,600
as your chances
to continue operating in Arizona.

577
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:42,373
Say!

578
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,947
What do you know about that?

579
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:53,084
You're not going into the railroad business
too, are you? Now, see here, Reavis --

580
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,090
- Baron.
- Baron. I want you --

581
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:58,684
Your lawyer told you that I hold
the threat of stopping, by injunction...

582
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:01,093
all railroads trespassing our land.

583
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:03,257
He advised you to capitulate.

584
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:05,267
- It's interesting, isn't it?
- Yes.

585
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,599
Since I don't want to impede progress...

586
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:11,196
- I'm permitting you to advance me $50,000.
- Fifty thousand?

587
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:15,005
As a first installment
for an immediate quitclaim deed.

588
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:18,013
Just the amount I was going
to offer you for my right-of-way.

589
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:21,278
Well, in that case I shall remove you
from the trespassers list.

590
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,649
Thank you, Baron.
Thank you.

591
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:29,891
Oh, Baron...

592
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:33,258
how about buying an interest
in some of your mineral rights?

593
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,888
How much of an interest?

594
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:38,365
Oh, a hundred thousand
as a starter.

595
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:40,936
That's not a very interesting start.

596
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,972
Uh, Mr. Gunther...

597
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:49,068
I understand that you own
that magnificent mansion outside of Phoenix.

598
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:51,670
That's right.

599
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:55,183
Well, now that would be
a very interesting down payment...

600
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:57,753
on some of my mineral rights.

601
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:05,059
Baron, you've got yourself a house.

602
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:13,031
I'm a landowner.
We all are.

603
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:16,401
- We want to know where we stand.
- In my private office without an appointment.

604
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:20,499
Just a moment. Let's not have any violence,
at least not till I get my story.

605
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:24,205
I'm McCleary of the <i>New York World.</i> If you
don't mind answering a few questions, Baron.

606
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:27,681
Is it true you're collecting thousands of dollars
in revenues, rents and royalties...

607
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:30,685
even before your claim
has been recognized in any court?

608
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:32,846
Would a railroad advance me a penny...

609
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:35,857
if there were a question
regarding the validity of my claim?

610
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:38,519
( Laughs )
Not if I know those railroads.

611
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:41,222
This is Gunther of Southern Railroad.

612
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:45,062
Mr. Gunther, are you paying me
for right-of-way through my land?

613
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:47,966
Well, uh, yes.

614
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:53,334
Why don't you wait till the government
recognizes his claim officially, Mr. Gunther?

615
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:56,344
And be forced to pay him
an impossible figure?

616
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,846
That would be
poor business foresight.

617
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:01,008
If I were you, men...

618
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,678
I would settle right now
for what he demands.

619
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,881
Why don't all of you gentlemen
listen to the railroad man?

620
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,958
That's why he's so rich.

621
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:13,228
Baron, my publisher, Mr. Pulitzer,
wants me to write you up...

622
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,958
as the man
who changed geography.

623

- This is only the beginning.
- This is sufficient for me.

My dear, I --

626
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:41,824
I've just bought
a private railroad car for us.

627
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:44,826
We'll go all over our territory
sometime next month.

Oh, let's not go anywhere for a long time.

Anything you say, my dear.

631
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:01,137
Is it unladylike for a baroness to --

632
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:04,577
to shout to everyone
that she loves her husband?

633
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:08,139
Never mind everyone.
Just shout it to me.

00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:05,539
- Well, I did it.
- You sure nobody was home?

00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:08,543
- No, nobody was home.
- Tom.

636
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:12,206
- It's wrong.
- He's just a lot of fancy words.

637

That little explosion'll
scare him right out of town.

Don't worry, Carrie.
We ain't gonna lose our home.

- I oughta turn you in to the sheriff.
- Pa!

He can't take the law into his own hands.

641
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:26,727
It ain't up to him to scare the baron outta here.
It's up to the government.

Hank, nothing'll stop me from tangling with you
if you get in my way.

You just got a room in town, that's all.
You got nothing to lose.

Not a very pleasant one, sir.

I am prepared for
a thorough investigation of all documents.

But I don't appreciate
the inference of falsification of papers.

did you go to

Yes, Mr. Griff, I did.

And that is where
her father and mother are buried?

927
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:57,310
I'm sorry.
You know how it is.

928
01:16:57,412 --> 01:16:59,141
Right.

929
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:02,648
<i>( Griff)</i>
<i>Unfortunately, this case is gonna take time.</i>

930
01:17:07,255 --> 01:17:10,247
Reavis knows I know
he forged the documents.

931
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:13,260
He also knows
it will be difficult to prove it.

932
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:15,330
Very difficult.

933
01:17:16,565 --> 01:17:20,296
<i>But what I don't like about this</i>
<i>is the feeling of mob justice.</i>

934
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:22,836
<i>That means people will be killed.</i>

935
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:29,709
You remember once before...

936
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:32,780
we walked like this
near my little adobe shack, huh?

937
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:35,281
- ( Chuckles ) Mm-hmm.
- Long time ago.

938
01:17:35,384 --> 01:17:37,579
And you remember that night?

939
01:17:37,686 --> 01:17:40,587
For months it did not rain in Phoenix.

940
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:43,988
It was so dry,
one could not even spit.

941
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:47,186
And then it rained --
a miracle.

942
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:51,197
Then you knock on the door--
a great miracle.

943
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:55,702
The rain brought life to the earth.
You brought life to Sofia.

944
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:59,605
But it is not your fault...

945
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:01,938
people call you a fake...

946
01:18:02,044 --> 01:18:05,445
'cause that miracle in the rain
was one big lie.

947
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:07,515
What are you talking about?

948
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:14,053
I, uh -- I know all the time
Sofia is not a Peralta.

949
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:16,317
- What?
- It is true.

950
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:19,485
But I checked with everyone.
They said she was abandoned with you.

951
01:18:19,594 --> 01:18:24,657
- They all said she was illegitimate.
- No. She did have her mother and father.

952
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:28,065
But there was a reason
why I could not let anyone know this.

953
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:30,400
What reason?

954
01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:33,099
She has Indian blood in her.

955
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:36,507
I promised her people before they die
I tell no one.

956
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,916
So she will be
like other girls, you know.

957
01:18:42,017 --> 01:18:45,043
It make it easier for Sofia
when she grow up...

958
01:18:45,153 --> 01:18:47,053
when she get married.

959
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:50,647
I promised them
I take good care of Sofia.

960
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:55,128
She will eat good and learn
and be a fine woman.

961
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:57,198
But I am poor.

962
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:03,833
And always Sofia, she has nothing
but the pigs and the mud.

963
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:06,032
Nothing.

964
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:08,609
And then you came...

965
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:10,610
and I made my plan.

966
01:19:10,712 --> 01:19:13,180
- You made a plan?
- Yes.

967
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:18,446
But I did not think it would mean
fights and shootings and lynchings...

968
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:20,453
and taking land from people.

969
01:19:20,555 --> 01:19:22,455
I did not think this.

970
01:19:22,557 --> 01:19:25,458
I think it would mean
good chance for Sofia...

971
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,790
to have everything
I could not give her.

972
01:19:27,896 --> 01:19:29,887
So I lie!

973
01:19:29,998 --> 01:19:33,695
I do not say
you have found the wrong child.

974
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:35,929
I say nothing.

975
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:38,062
Ohh. I do not sleep.

976
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:40,641
I -- I'm sick inside.

977
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:43,267
But all the time I say to myself...

978
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:47,280
''Pepito, this is good for Sofia.''

979
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:49,543
Oh, but now I know it's wrong.

980
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:51,551
It's wrong.

981
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:55,214
It is because of me that Mr. Griff say
your writing on the paper is false.

982
01:19:55,323 --> 01:19:58,884
It is because of me
he say Sofia is not a Peralta.

983
01:19:58,994 --> 01:20:00,894
He is a smart man.

984
01:20:00,996 --> 01:20:03,965
I will go to him
and make a stop to all this.

985
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:07,694
I will make a stop
to people getting hurt.

986
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,964
I will tell him it is not you...

987
01:20:10,071 --> 01:20:13,097
but <i>me</i> who is the fake.

988
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:15,403
Well, I'm --

989
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:20,714
I'm sorry for what I did to you...

990
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:22,784
my friend.

991
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:35,530
You're leaving, hmm?

992
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:37,598
<i>( Reavis )</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

993
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:40,725
Pepito told me about myself.

994
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:42,736
Did he?

995
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,738
Is that why you're going away?

996
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,740
No.

997
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:49,538
Then it's because of what I am.

998
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:52,613
- That's not why I'm leaving.
- Then what is it?

999
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:56,617
I'm a fake.

1000
01:20:57,919 --> 01:21:00,820
Pepito told me
you had blamed yourself for his fraud.

1001
01:21:00,922 --> 01:21:03,823
- Did he say that?
- Yes.

1002
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:05,893
You don't understand.

1003
01:21:07,128 --> 01:21:09,028
He had a reason for lying.

1004
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:11,030
It was for you.

1005
01:21:11,132 --> 01:21:14,226
I have no reason.
It's for myself.

1006
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:19,366
Your eyes look sick.
You've been crying.

1007
01:21:19,474 --> 01:21:22,375
I don't want you to feel guilty
because of me.

1008
01:21:22,477 --> 01:21:25,105
Oh, good heavens, Sofia.

1009
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:29,582
I spent years developing your mind,
and yet you're unable to --

1010
01:21:29,684 --> 01:21:32,016
to grasp what I'm saying.

1011
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,384
I tell you, I'm a forger.

1012
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:37,925
The whole scheme is one big fraud.

1013
01:21:38,026 --> 01:21:40,324
There never has been a Peralta.

1014
01:21:40,428 --> 01:21:45,491
I created the family out of my own mind
and faked it with ink in the records.

1015
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:50,333
<i>I married you because it was part of my scheme,</i>
<i>not because I loved you.</i>

1016
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:57,004
Well, I'm ready for your contempt...

1017
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:59,080
and your disgust.

1018
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:03,277
Take a good look at me.

1019
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:06,718
Take a good look at your husband.

1020
01:22:06,821 --> 01:22:09,119
Now you know why I'm leaving.

1021
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:12,751
I don't want you to go.

1022
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:19,592
Sofia, look, we have over $500,000.
We can go to Europe. They'll never find us.

1023
01:22:19,701 --> 01:22:22,602
Let's not have any illusions,James.
We're guilty, both of us.

1024
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:25,605
You may go.
I'll take the money back to the people.

1025
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:27,607
Now y<i>ou're</i> having illusions.

1026
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:29,609
I am Mrs.James Reavis...

1027
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:33,545
and one of us must have the dignity
to accept punishment.

1028
01:22:33,648 --> 01:22:36,879
One of us must have the dignity
to recognize love.

1029
01:22:36,985 --> 01:22:40,182
I'll always love you.
Nothing can change that.

1030
01:22:41,823 --> 01:22:43,723
You still want me?

1031
01:22:43,825 --> 01:22:46,726
I'll want you until the day I die.

1032
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:49,729
It is not death,
it is dying that alarms me.

1033
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:54,291
It is not your crime,
it's your weakness that alarms me.

1034
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:03,678
Arizona.

1035
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:07,348
Seems so small.

1036
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:11,744
You suddenly seem so great.

1037
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:16,623
Now I know what I was looking for--

1038
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:21,329
a woman who would love me
for what I am.

1039
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:27,167
No man can live without that.

1040
01:23:29,037 --> 01:23:31,335
No man can ask for more.

1041
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:39,171
- This will make you feel better, dear.
- Thank you.

1042
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,248
None for me, Loma.

1043
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:56,553
Mrs. Reavis.

1044
01:23:56,664 --> 01:23:58,825
- You sent for me?
- Yes, Mr. Griff.

1045
01:23:58,933 --> 01:24:01,834
I, uh --
I have a statement to make.

1046
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:06,396
Strangely enough, I was on my way to see you
when Mr. Alvarez came to my office.

1047
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:08,408
Oh.

1048
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:11,479
Mr. Griff, you were right.

1049
01:24:12,647 --> 01:24:17,482
My claim is a bad cigar
wrapped in a rich Spanish leaf.

1050
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:21,088
I am guilty of the criminal act
of forgery...

1051
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:25,319
with intent to defraud
the government of the United States.

1052
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:29,955
My wife is innocent of any part
in the conspiracy.

1053
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:34,764
And Loma Morales
and Pepito Alvarez...

1054
01:24:34,869 --> 01:24:37,929
believed my story of her ancestry.

1055
01:24:38,039 --> 01:24:39,939
They are blameless.

1056
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:42,168
That's very interesting, Mr. Reavis.

1057
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:45,679
Excuse me a moment.

1058
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:49,884
Troy.

1059
01:25:02,297 --> 01:25:04,265
Your Honor.

1060
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:07,994
Ladies, will you please be seated?

1061
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:10,003
What is this?

1062
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:14,007
The court of private land grant claims
is now in session.

1063
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:17,010
- What?
- This is quite an occasion, Mr. Reavis.

1064
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:19,342
One of historical significance.

1065
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:21,847
This federal court has been
granted the permission...

1066
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,851
to sit wherever
and whenever it wants...

1067
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:28,980
and we've decided to hold court
here in your home...

1068
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:32,287
to avoid a mob riot
in a public hearing.

1069
01:25:32,393 --> 01:25:35,157
Mr. Reavis, we have legal proof...

1070
01:25:35,263 --> 01:25:38,664
that will indict, convict and sentence you
to the penitentiary.

1071
01:25:38,766 --> 01:25:42,497
Proof?
My forgery is <i>fl</i>awless.

1072
01:25:45,507 --> 01:25:47,475
Remember this?

1073
01:25:49,677 --> 01:25:53,238
The 1 7 48 volume
of the Spanish land grants.

1074
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:57,842
<i>( Griff) I must admit this is the finest</i>
<i>example of forgery I've ever seen.</i>

1075
01:25:59,521 --> 01:26:02,422
Now, we had the ink
on this page analyzed.

1076
01:26:02,524 --> 01:26:04,788
It contains the tannin acid of oak.

1077
01:26:04,893 --> 01:26:07,794
No, that's impossible.
I made that ink myself.

1078
01:26:07,896 --> 01:26:11,297
And the monks haven't
changed their formula for over 500 years.

1079
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:15,631
A monk named Brother Paul came
to Alcántara from the north of Spain.

1080
01:26:15,737 --> 01:26:17,637
He brought his own ink.

1081
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:21,505
Every word on this page
was written by him with his own ink...

1082
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:26,376
except this account of the grant awarded
to Peralta by King Ferdinand of Spain.

1083
01:26:26,481 --> 01:26:29,382
This was written with ink
which had no oak.

1084
01:26:29,484 --> 01:26:33,545
<i>You used the ink made in the south</i>
<i>when you forged this page.</i>

1085
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,987
You didn't need my confession, did you?

1086
01:26:37,091 --> 01:26:39,059
No, not now.

1087
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:47,164
Will it be a -- a long prison term?

1088
01:26:47,268 --> 01:26:50,669
It's according to how much money
you return to the landowners.

1089
01:26:50,772 --> 01:26:53,172
The lavish manner
in which you spent the money...

1090
01:26:53,274 --> 01:26:56,175
will determine the years
of your imprisonment.

1091
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:58,245
There's all the money.

1092
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:02,376
I'm tired.
I need a rest.

1093
01:27:02,483 --> 01:27:05,816
Father Guardian
told me to meditate.

1094
01:27:07,121 --> 01:27:09,112
I should have listened to him
that night.

1095
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:11,192
The court cannot guarantee the rest...

1096
01:27:11,292 --> 01:27:14,853
but you'll have sufficient time
to meditate.

1097
01:27:14,963 --> 01:27:18,865
Well, I will help you gather up
all my records and receipts and papers.

1098
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:21,936
You'll need them.
They're at my office.

1099
01:27:22,036 --> 01:27:26,939
Mr. Alvarez,
I'm going to request leniency for you.

1100
01:27:28,042 --> 01:27:32,172
Frankly, Your Honor, I don't see
criminal intent in his conspiracy...

1101
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:35,249
just ignorant devotion
and sentiment.

1102
01:27:37,151 --> 01:27:39,119
Are you ready?

1103
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:48,488
Loma...

1104
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:52,327
I've never thanked you
for all you've done for Sofia...

1105
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:54,458
the in<i>fl</i>uence you've had on her.

1106
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:58,138
I'm --

1107
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:02,076
I'm grateful.

1108
01:28:03,811 --> 01:28:06,780
-<i>( Gavel Bangs )</i>
-<i>(Judge ) Court is now adjourned.</i>

1109
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:14,586
- Are you ready, Mr. Griff?
- Yes.

1110
01:28:33,207 --> 01:28:35,607
By the way, Mr. Reavis...

1111
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:37,678
did you read my book?

1112
01:28:39,947 --> 01:28:41,915
It was my bible.

1113
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:48,384
The land in Arizona
don't belong to no baron!

1114
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:51,890
It belongs to you and me!
We paid for it!

1115
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:56,259
We paid for it with money,
and we paid for it with our hard work!

1116
01:28:56,364 --> 01:28:58,764
Now, maybe these government men
mean all right...

1117
01:28:58,866 --> 01:29:01,426
but I'm sayin'
it takes 'em too long to act!

1118
01:29:01,536 --> 01:29:03,629
We gotta do somethin' now!

1119
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:12,074
There's only one thing about this case
I can't understand.

1120
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:14,080
What's that?

1121
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:19,142
After devoting so many years to this scheme,
what made you confess?

1122
01:29:23,558 --> 01:29:25,719
I fell in love with my wife.

1123
01:29:33,434 --> 01:29:35,402
Get that sign down!

The Baron is comin'!

1126
01:30:16,811 --> 01:30:19,712
Joe, I don't like this quiet.

1127
01:30:19,814 --> 01:30:21,941
Yeah.

1128
01:30:22,049 --> 01:30:26,577
Funny. I never seen this square so empty
this time of night.

Ask the government man.
He'll tell you.

1143
01:34:10,778 --> 01:34:14,976
That's why he was with me --
to question me, to save your property.

1144
01:34:15,082 --> 01:34:16,982
You know the law.

1145
01:34:17,084 --> 01:34:20,076
Tell 'em what'll happen if they hang me.
Tell 'em what'll happen to their land!

Hang me, and you hang your ranches
and farms and shops and mines.

Hang me, and you'll never give Griff

What do I have to do
to pound it into your thick skulls?

1153

Hang me, and you hang
