1
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:58,672
Any officers in the Kowloon Bay area?

2
00:02:58,974 --> 00:02:59,736
Yes

3
00:02:59,942 --> 00:03:01,034
We've got a reported suicide
in Hoi Bun Road

4
00:03:01,243 --> 00:03:01,766
Go check it out

5
00:03:01,944 --> 00:03:02,740
Roger that. Out

6
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:08,872
Sir, did you call the police?

7
00:03:09,085 --> 00:03:10,143
Yes, up there...

8
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,078
You take down the information

9
00:03:12,288 --> 00:03:13,152
I'll go check it out

10
00:03:13,956 --> 00:03:15,287
May I see your I.D. please?

11
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,186
Okay

12
00:04:55,424 --> 00:05:00,259
Be careful! It's everywhere!

13
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:25,444
His pulse is weak. We need to do
a blood transfusion

14
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:58,681
Doctor

15
00:06:15,204 --> 00:06:16,398
Find out what's wrong with her

16
00:06:16,605 --> 00:06:17,503
Yes

17
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:24,937
The blood bank is out of AB negative

18
00:06:25,147 --> 00:06:26,478
Find some more donors! Okay

19
00:06:41,363 --> 00:06:42,853
Tell them to come here at once

20
00:06:43,632 --> 00:06:44,599
Excuse me

21
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,798
Wait a moment

22
00:06:46,735 --> 00:06:48,794
Did you manage to

23
00:06:49,004 --> 00:06:49,936
save that couple?

24
00:06:50,172 --> 00:06:52,231
Which ones? What are their names?

25
00:06:54,376 --> 00:06:55,843
I don't know their names

26
00:06:56,045 --> 00:06:57,774
Look, I just brought them in

27
00:06:59,515 --> 00:07:01,881
I'm sorry. I'll call you back

28
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:03,084
Thanks, bye

29
00:07:07,222 --> 00:07:09,417
The one who jumped off
the building died

30
00:07:09,692 --> 00:07:12,820
The couple who cut themselves
are still in the ER

31
00:07:14,263 --> 00:07:16,458
Have you found any
AB Negative donors?

32
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:17,757
They're critical!

33
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,059
I know. There are two donors
on the way

34
00:07:20,302 --> 00:07:22,361
I'm AB Negative too.
I can donate

35
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:24,332
Can you? Great!

36
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:25,904
Walk along the red line to Block D

37
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:27,540
the blood bank

38
00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:28,640
Our nurse will meet you there

39
00:07:28,877 --> 00:07:29,809
Okay. Let's go!

40
00:07:33,616 --> 00:07:34,810
Yes, Block D, transfusion room

41
00:07:35,084 --> 00:07:37,484
A police officer is coming
to give blood

42
00:09:16,785 --> 00:09:17,649
Miss

43
00:09:18,854 --> 00:09:19,821
Miss

44
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:21,989
You won't feel a thing

45
00:09:22,191 --> 00:09:23,283
Okay

46
00:11:06,161 --> 00:11:07,685
His pupils are responding

47
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,120
He's still unconscious

48
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:12,157
What about the girl?

49
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:15,036
She's in a coma

50
00:11:16,338 --> 00:11:17,635
She has cancer anyway

51
00:11:17,873 --> 00:11:18,862
I don't think she can make it

52
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:23,637
Certified dead at 2:45 a. M

53
00:11:27,082 --> 00:11:28,310
Check again!

54
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:35,988
Prepare her

55
00:12:07,122 --> 00:12:07,986
Have a drink

56
00:12:08,557 --> 00:12:10,184
No thanks, I've got some water

57
00:12:13,095 --> 00:12:14,084
Thanks, nurse

58
00:12:15,163 --> 00:12:16,095
Thanks

59
00:12:22,471 --> 00:12:23,699
Hi. Hi

60
00:12:24,406 --> 00:12:26,840
Office, who did we save?

61
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:28,440
A couple

62
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,040
They attempted suicide

63
00:12:32,581 --> 00:12:33,707
I hope they make it

64
00:12:37,886 --> 00:12:39,285
You're working on a Sunday?

65
00:12:40,188 --> 00:12:42,679
I'm an architect.
I have to survey sites

66
00:12:42,925 --> 00:12:43,857
Here's my name card

67
00:12:46,695 --> 00:12:48,060
As we've the same rare blood types

68
00:12:48,297 --> 00:12:49,025
if anything happens...

69
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:50,424
We can help each other

70
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:53,400
Miss, I'm Eric

71
00:12:56,939 --> 00:12:58,907
I'm a Catholic

72
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,705
Sorry. I don't have a name-card.
I'm Joy

73
00:13:04,012 --> 00:13:06,071
J-O-Y

74
00:13:06,415 --> 00:13:07,746
A happy name!

75
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:08,848
Really?

76
00:13:09,518 --> 00:13:10,712
Sir, what's your name?

77
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:13,351
Sam Ka Lok. You can call me Lok

78
00:13:21,396 --> 00:13:23,159
What's happening?
Are they going to be okay?

79
00:13:23,765 --> 00:13:25,756
The man is in a coma

80
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:28,595
And the girl is dead

81
00:13:31,606 --> 00:13:33,198
Nurse, how's my daughter?

82
00:13:33,442 --> 00:13:34,773
Are you her immediate family?

83
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:35,874
Yes, I'm her father

84
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:37,100
I'm her mom

85
00:13:37,412 --> 00:13:39,812
We tried our best

86
00:13:40,082 --> 00:13:41,777
I'm sorry, but she didn't make it

87
00:13:43,618 --> 00:13:45,779
The nurse will help you make

88
00:13:46,088 --> 00:13:46,884
the necessary arrangements

89
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:48,247
I'm sorry

90
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:33,161
Lets open it up to check

91
00:14:33,268 --> 00:14:35,236
Calm down

92
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:41,576
Undo the bandages

93
00:14:41,943 --> 00:14:43,604
You shouldn't go over there.
Stay here

94
00:14:43,812 --> 00:14:45,211
Calm down

95
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,708
My daughter...

96
00:14:46,748 --> 00:14:47,737
Calm down...

97
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,050
My daughter...

98
00:14:51,153 --> 00:14:52,711
Madam, calm down

99
00:14:54,523 --> 00:14:56,081
My daughter is still alive...

100
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:57,790
Calm down

101
00:15:00,762 --> 00:15:02,423
My daughter is still alive...

102
00:15:03,832 --> 00:15:06,062
Calm down and I'll go and check

103
00:15:07,235 --> 00:15:08,634
Doctor

104
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:10,331
Tell her family that she's dead

105
00:15:10,572 --> 00:15:11,766
Tell them

106
00:15:16,678 --> 00:15:19,112
It was only a reflex action

107
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:22,617
Your daughter is dead.
Please calm down

108
00:15:50,112 --> 00:15:51,739
Lucky the man survived

109
00:15:51,947 --> 00:15:52,914
I hope he's all right

110
00:15:53,115 --> 00:15:54,377
I think he'll be okay

111
00:16:02,491 --> 00:16:04,186
I'm waiting for a police car
to pick me up. And you?

112
00:16:04,793 --> 00:16:05,987
There's a taxi

113
00:16:26,281 --> 00:16:27,441
You go first

114
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:31,313
Do I know you?

115
00:16:33,188 --> 00:16:35,918
I don't think so. What is it?

116
00:16:37,592 --> 00:16:39,025
Did you see it?

117
00:16:39,394 --> 00:16:40,827
What?

118
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:44,597
The girl looked at us

119
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:26,700
What are you doing?

120
00:17:30,845 --> 00:17:34,008
Master Sam, you'd better
move out of here soon!

121
00:17:34,249 --> 00:17:36,809
I'm scared coming
all the way up here

122
00:17:37,018 --> 00:17:39,248
You're the only ones
left in the building

123
00:17:39,487 --> 00:17:40,818
Not the only ones!

124
00:17:41,122 --> 00:17:44,614
What about the Taoist temple
over there!

125
00:17:46,928 --> 00:17:48,293
Isn't that kind of spooky?

126
00:17:48,964 --> 00:17:51,159
No, not at all

127
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:52,331
I... Come in!

128
00:17:52,734 --> 00:17:53,530
I'm scared. I'll go now

129
00:17:53,735 --> 00:17:54,759
Don't move

130
00:18:28,536 --> 00:18:29,434
Dad

131
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:30,903
Oh, you're back

132
00:18:31,106 --> 00:18:31,936
Mrs. Chan

133
00:18:32,574 --> 00:18:33,472
Don't move

134
00:18:33,675 --> 00:18:35,040
Lok, how are you?

135
00:18:35,277 --> 00:18:36,301
You're looking better every time
I see you

136
00:18:36,544 --> 00:18:38,273
When will you bring
your girlfriend home?

137
00:18:38,446 --> 00:18:39,504
Soon...

138
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:43,081
A good-looking guy like you
can't be shy!

139
00:18:43,285 --> 00:18:45,082
The girls will think you're boring!

140
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:47,915
Dad, don't talk about me to everyone!

141
00:18:48,123 --> 00:18:50,250
It's all right. You know Mrs. Chan!

142
00:18:50,492 --> 00:18:51,891
I mentioned it on purpose

143
00:18:52,127 --> 00:18:54,027
So she can help find you a girlfriend

144
00:18:54,596 --> 00:18:56,655
Good, finished. Take a look!

145
00:18:57,232 --> 00:18:57,960
Perfect!

146
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,155
Right!

147
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:00,858
I'll show you something!

148
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:01,797
Is that your son?

149
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:04,471
I won't show you my girlfriend

150
00:19:04,673 --> 00:19:05,970
What's she like? Cute?

151
00:19:06,441 --> 00:19:09,342
Don't you get scared
looking at dead people, Lok?

152
00:19:09,577 --> 00:19:11,101
It’s just a job

153
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,042
Look at him. He's so handsome
in his uniform!

154
00:19:17,986 --> 00:19:21,046
Another blackout! What a dump!

155
00:19:40,442 --> 00:19:41,966
Be careful

156
00:19:42,644 --> 00:19:44,578
I think we have to fix the fuse

157
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:46,110
Why bother? Just move

158
00:19:46,314 --> 00:19:47,281
Master Sam, I'm leaving

159
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:48,816
So soon?

160
00:19:49,117 --> 00:19:51,176
Another one from another angle

161
00:19:51,386 --> 00:19:52,546
Have you got enough? Yes

162
00:19:52,854 --> 00:19:54,082
I'll see you soon

163
00:21:11,866 --> 00:21:14,266
Still here? Everyone's gone

164
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:17,433
I'll be leaving soon.
What about you?

165
00:21:18,006 --> 00:21:19,234
Work, work and more work!

166
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:23,173
Are you okay?

167
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:25,311
Yes

168
00:21:25,847 --> 00:21:29,749
How can you give blood
when you're so weak yourself?

169
00:21:30,318 --> 00:21:31,546
I just want to help people

170
00:21:31,853 --> 00:21:32,842
Help?

171
00:21:34,088 --> 00:21:36,613
You helped the wrong person

172
00:21:36,825 --> 00:21:37,757
Look!

173
00:21:38,126 --> 00:21:40,890
The man is in a coma and
the woman is dead

174
00:21:41,162 --> 00:21:42,993
You split them up!

175
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:48,401
Let them die if they want to,
for God's sake!

176
00:22:01,316 --> 00:22:02,214
What is it?

177
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:04,111
Nothing

178
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,250
I'll finish up here

179
00:27:02,283 --> 00:27:04,251
Mr. So, can you tell us anything else?

180
00:27:05,486 --> 00:27:08,319
What happened just now?
What did you see?

181
00:27:10,658 --> 00:27:11,682
Mr. So?

182
00:27:48,696 --> 00:27:50,288
Mr. So, that'll be $40

183
00:27:51,265 --> 00:27:52,732
What about the camera?

184
00:27:54,035 --> 00:27:57,698
We've checked it.
The flash is all right

185
00:27:57,905 --> 00:27:59,167
Did you drop it?

186
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:01,204
We've checked it

187
00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:02,273
It's okay now

188
00:28:07,181 --> 00:28:07,977
Thanks

189
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:41,538
Father

190
00:29:56,791 --> 00:29:58,520
I've never seen this person before

191
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,821
But ever since I gave blood

192
00:30:01,062 --> 00:30:02,188
she's been following me

193
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:06,423
It's all right. Don't worry

194
00:30:08,736 --> 00:30:10,567
You just wanted to help

195
00:30:10,905 --> 00:30:12,202
She won't hurt you

196
00:30:20,514 --> 00:30:22,209
You haven't slept for the whole night

197
00:30:22,483 --> 00:30:23,609
You must be tired

198
00:30:23,884 --> 00:30:25,647
Take a rest here

199
00:32:07,388 --> 00:32:09,982
The donors who gave blood
last night saved his life

200
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:20,895
Does he have a girlfriend?

201
00:32:24,705 --> 00:32:25,831
You show him the way

202
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:38,381
The girl you're looking for
is in the second bed

203
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:45,991
Thanks. I'll be fine

204
00:33:07,314 --> 00:33:09,179
You don't belong here

205
00:33:15,222 --> 00:33:16,348
Our Father who art in heaven

206
00:33:17,191 --> 00:33:19,182
Hallowed be thy name

207
00:33:21,061 --> 00:33:22,824
Thy kingdom come

208
00:33:23,197 --> 00:33:25,665
Thy will be done

209
00:33:25,866 --> 00:33:27,163
Our Earth as it is in heaven

210
00:33:27,434 --> 00:33:29,629
Give us this day our daily bread

211
00:33:29,937 --> 00:33:36,809
And forgive us our trespasses

212
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:17,551
Why did you split us apart?

213
00:34:18,786 --> 00:34:20,276
I would have stayed with Jack

214
00:34:20,487 --> 00:34:21,818
but they separated us

215
00:34:22,056 --> 00:34:23,387
They must bring Jack to me!

216
00:34:23,624 --> 00:34:25,114
They must!

217
00:37:05,786 --> 00:37:06,753
Hello?

218
00:37:08,322 --> 00:37:09,346
Yes

219
00:37:11,425 --> 00:37:13,620
He is our principal

220
00:37:23,871 --> 00:37:26,965
Father... What's happened?

221
00:37:34,381 --> 00:37:35,746
He's dead!

222
00:38:34,274 --> 00:38:36,401
A mourner has arrived!

223
00:38:39,012 --> 00:38:40,912
Please stop

224
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,811
One bow

225
00:38:47,654 --> 00:38:49,713
Two bows

226
00:38:52,459 --> 00:38:54,518
Last bow

227
00:39:00,067 --> 00:39:02,297
Family bow

228
00:39:08,141 --> 00:39:10,405
Please burn your incense

229
00:40:09,436 --> 00:40:11,495
Did you have a dream?

230
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,533
The east wind blows

231
00:40:45,806 --> 00:40:47,535
The altar is raised

232
00:40:47,808 --> 00:40:49,799
The east wind blows from the hell

233
00:40:50,077 --> 00:40:53,513
Miss Yau Yin Ping

234
00:40:53,714 --> 00:40:56,774
Leave hell and fly to heaven!

235
00:41:25,846 --> 00:41:28,838
Leave hell and fly to heaven!

236
00:41:38,425 --> 00:41:39,687
Stand up

237
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,925
Stand there

238
00:41:44,898 --> 00:41:46,456
Take your sister's spirit tablet

239
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:48,794
Go in there and

240
00:41:49,002 --> 00:41:51,197
See what your sister wants

241
00:41:58,612 --> 00:41:59,874
Are you okay?

242
00:42:20,834 --> 00:42:22,825
Ask your sister to tell you

243
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,560
What she wants

244
00:42:24,871 --> 00:42:25,929
Ask her to tell you

245
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:28,639
Otherwise, we can't help her

246
00:42:31,178 --> 00:42:32,076
Get away!

247
00:42:33,513 --> 00:42:35,071
Leave me alone! Eric!

248
00:42:36,983 --> 00:42:37,745
Eric

249
00:43:22,763 --> 00:43:24,128
Are you okay?

250
00:43:25,065 --> 00:43:26,032
I'm fine

251
00:43:26,433 --> 00:43:27,764
Do you want to see a doctor?

252
00:43:28,735 --> 00:43:29,667
There's no need

253
00:43:36,243 --> 00:43:37,437
I don't understand

254
00:43:39,312 --> 00:43:42,042
The master only wants to
save this woman from hell

255
00:43:42,415 --> 00:43:44,406
I don't know why she doesn't
want to leave

256
00:43:51,091 --> 00:43:53,218
Dying isn't so bad

257
00:43:54,161 --> 00:43:57,528
Everyone has their own worries

258
00:44:14,147 --> 00:44:16,012
What kind of disease do you have?

259
00:44:38,205 --> 00:44:39,604
Mental illness

260
00:44:41,074 --> 00:44:42,735
I had a nervous breakdown

261
00:44:45,412 --> 00:44:47,346
On my 7th birthday

262
00:44:47,848 --> 00:44:50,009
My mom bought me a cake

263
00:44:50,884 --> 00:44:52,317
I was very happy

264
00:44:52,652 --> 00:44:55,450
They sang me a birthday song

265
00:44:55,989 --> 00:45:05,796
Happy birthday to you...

266
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:17,137
Then mom killed dad

267
00:45:21,047 --> 00:45:24,847
She cut me a slice of the cake

268
00:45:25,151 --> 00:45:28,018
The cake was covered with blood

269
00:45:30,156 --> 00:45:36,618
And yet it was so sweet and delicious" '

270
00:45:37,163 --> 00:45:39,028
Why did you mom kill your dad?

271
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,669
Mom told me...

272
00:45:43,937 --> 00:45:45,529
I killed your dad...

273
00:45:46,873 --> 00:45:48,864
Because I love him

274
00:45:54,147 --> 00:45:57,981
My mom had nervous breakdown

275
00:46:01,087 --> 00:46:04,022
She had nervous breakdown...

276
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,218
Do you hate your mom?

277
00:46:08,428 --> 00:46:09,452
I don't hate her

278
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:12,222
She loves me

279
00:46:21,942 --> 00:46:23,466
I hate her!

280
00:46:25,378 --> 00:46:27,369
She shouldn't have killed my dad!

281
00:46:28,181 --> 00:46:29,239
She shouldn't have killed him!

282
00:46:33,019 --> 00:46:34,316
She shouldn't have killed him!

283
00:46:41,728 --> 00:46:44,720
The doctor says my mom had
a nervous breakdown

284
00:46:46,032 --> 00:46:48,057
She is still in the hospital

285
00:46:51,972 --> 00:46:54,202
I've been there too

286
00:46:56,509 --> 00:46:59,034
My doctor says it's in my genes

287
00:47:01,381 --> 00:47:05,784
No-one knows when it will recur

288
00:47:09,622 --> 00:47:11,920
And so I have to keep
taking medicine

289
00:47:21,368 --> 00:47:23,359
At least you're okay now

290
00:47:27,407 --> 00:47:30,035
Tell me, do I know you?

291
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,538
Please tell me!

292
00:47:32,245 --> 00:47:34,941
I can't tell what's real from
what's imaginary

293
00:47:35,215 --> 00:47:36,477
Tell me whether I know you!

294
00:47:36,783 --> 00:47:37,681
Tell me please

295
00:47:37,784 --> 00:47:38,842
Of course you do

296
00:47:39,085 --> 00:47:40,052
Why else would I be here

297
00:47:40,353 --> 00:47:41,445
listening to you all this time?

298
00:47:41,988 --> 00:47:43,012
Right?

299
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:12,041
Miss Yip, Doctor Liu is here

300
00:49:15,782 --> 00:49:19,149
Who is he? Don't let just anyone
in here!

301
00:49:19,486 --> 00:49:21,818
Sir, I'm sorry.
Please wait outside

302
00:49:22,055 --> 00:49:23,044
The patient needs a check up

303
00:49:23,289 --> 00:49:24,187
I'll be waiting for you

304
00:49:28,628 --> 00:49:31,426
OK, wait outside, please

305
00:49:36,803 --> 00:49:38,134
Are you all right?

306
00:49:39,806 --> 00:49:40,830
Did you take your medication?

307
00:49:44,244 --> 00:49:45,438
Yes

308
00:49:46,112 --> 00:49:47,340
You should be all right

309
00:49:48,381 --> 00:49:50,872
if you keep taking your medicine

310
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,515
What is it?
I still have other patients to see

311
00:50:10,703 --> 00:50:12,261
Who's having the tea?

312
00:50:39,399 --> 00:50:40,388
Hello?

313
00:51:14,334 --> 00:51:16,495
Before he lost consciousness

314
00:51:16,736 --> 00:51:18,135
He called out your names

315
00:51:18,371 --> 00:51:20,066
But we didn't know how to reach you

316
00:51:20,273 --> 00:51:21,865
Then the nurse checked
the donor records

317
00:51:22,108 --> 00:51:24,941
And we realized that
you gave blood together

318
00:51:25,545 --> 00:51:27,206
Can I see my friend?

319
00:53:08,648 --> 00:53:09,706
Joy

320
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:20,151
Pills... Have you got any pills?

321
00:53:20,593 --> 00:53:24,552
Pills...

322
00:53:34,273 --> 00:53:36,002
I don't know what your relationship is

323
00:53:36,609 --> 00:53:38,372
I think you'd better
not see her any more

324
00:53:38,644 --> 00:53:39,611
Why?

325
00:53:42,081 --> 00:53:43,446
Don't you know she's insane?

326
00:53:43,649 --> 00:53:44,513
I know

327
00:53:45,551 --> 00:53:46,347
Don't you know

328
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:48,211
she could seriously injure someone?

329
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:55,659
So what?

330
00:56:03,523 --> 00:56:04,888
Hey! What are you doing?

331
00:56:33,085 --> 00:56:34,382
Have a glass of water

332
00:56:35,588 --> 00:56:38,148
Please save me, I didn't do it!

333
00:56:38,357 --> 00:56:38,880
Calm down

334
00:56:39,125 --> 00:56:40,092
Believe me, I didn't do it!

335
00:56:40,293 --> 00:56:41,851
I believe you, I believe you!

336
00:56:52,238 --> 00:56:55,230
Please give us a moment

337
00:56:55,474 --> 00:56:56,304
Excuse me

338
00:56:57,476 --> 00:56:58,408
Calm down

339
00:56:58,644 --> 00:57:00,305
It's alright. Don't worry

340
00:57:06,852 --> 00:57:08,046
Joy is possessed by demons

341
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:12,655
Bullshit!

342
00:57:19,098 --> 00:57:20,224
Are you all right?

343
00:57:33,913 --> 00:57:36,882
Be a good girl.
Finish your statement

344
00:57:37,249 --> 00:57:40,013
Don't worry.
The patient will be all right

345
00:57:47,126 --> 00:57:48,252
Finish the statement

346
00:57:53,265 --> 00:57:54,425
What's your name?

347
00:57:58,838 --> 00:58:00,362
Yip Tze Man

348
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,807
Where do you live?

349
00:58:06,078 --> 00:58:07,841
Kowloon City

350
00:58:34,206 --> 00:58:35,002
What do you do?

351
00:58:35,207 --> 00:58:36,367
Stop it!

352
00:58:36,575 --> 00:58:37,507
Go inside

353
00:58:45,551 --> 00:58:47,382
Don't you know she's insane?

354
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,553
She had a nervous breakdown

355
00:58:50,022 --> 00:58:51,046
She's lost touch with reality

356
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:53,155
She doesn't know what she's doing

357
00:58:53,426 --> 00:58:55,360
Is this what you called
demonic possession?

358
00:59:00,933 --> 00:59:02,594
You haven't done anything
to help her!

359
00:59:02,835 --> 00:59:06,236
Cut it out. I'm her doctor

360
00:59:06,672 --> 00:59:08,367
I know what's best for my patient

361
00:59:08,641 --> 00:59:10,074
I don't want her to hurt

362
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:11,673
herself or anyone else

363
00:59:12,978 --> 00:59:15,105
Sending her to the hospital
is the best way

364
00:59:17,783 --> 00:59:19,273
Can you help her?

365
00:59:21,954 --> 00:59:23,785
You're still on duty.
Are you crazy?

366
01:00:09,702 --> 01:00:10,794
Don't come in!

367
01:00:15,107 --> 01:00:18,042
The master left a message for you

368
01:00:18,277 --> 01:00:19,471
The man has become zombie and

369
01:00:19,678 --> 01:00:20,804
the woman is a vengeful spirit

370
01:00:23,949 --> 01:00:26,315
So now you have to pay for it

371
01:00:28,988 --> 01:00:30,819
The ghost wants you

372
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:33,388
to kill her boyfriend

373
01:00:33,793 --> 01:00:35,886
That's the only way
you can save your friend

374
01:00:41,567 --> 01:00:44,331
Don't worry. It's all right

375
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:47,198
Mom is here. It's all right

376
01:00:47,439 --> 01:00:50,067
Don't be afraid...

377
01:01:31,217 --> 01:01:33,651
Lok, you have to help me.
Kill him!

378
01:02:22,735 --> 01:02:24,794
Stand up...

379
01:02:26,772 --> 01:02:27,864
Be good

380
01:02:50,729 --> 01:02:51,593
Paul! Fancy seeing you here!

381
01:02:51,797 --> 01:02:52,889
Yes, I'm checking on Joy

382
01:02:53,132 --> 01:02:54,121
See you around

383
01:02:55,834 --> 01:02:57,927
Be careful what you say

384
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:00,600
I don't want anyone
to know about us

385
01:03:02,508 --> 01:03:06,308
I am the only person
who can keep you out of jail

386
01:03:14,253 --> 01:03:15,413
Understand?

387
01:03:20,025 --> 01:03:21,253
You're crazy!

388
01:03:26,732 --> 01:03:28,199
Yes, I'm crazy

389
01:03:29,902 --> 01:03:31,927
I could kill someone and
still not go to jail...

390
01:03:42,881 --> 01:03:45,076
This woman has
a severe psychotic condition

391
01:03:45,351 --> 01:03:46,579
She claims she always sees ghosts

392
01:03:47,086 --> 01:03:48,053
What should I do?

393
01:03:48,854 --> 01:03:51,186
Joy, how do you feel?

394
01:03:51,523 --> 01:03:54,185
Let us help you

395
01:03:59,665 --> 01:04:03,032
Joy, we can't help you
if you're like this

396
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,479
Joy, you say you can see ghosts

397
01:04:16,715 --> 01:04:18,580
Can you tell us what they look like?

398
01:04:24,023 --> 01:04:25,923
It's an open and shut case.
We don't need to any more tests

399
01:04:27,893 --> 01:04:29,383
Are you looking for me?

400
01:04:37,069 --> 01:04:38,696
I'm Yau Yin Ping

401
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:45,574
You won't understand
how a woman feels

402
01:04:45,811 --> 01:04:46,539
Someone enduring an incurable disease

403
01:04:46,812 --> 01:04:48,245
who wanted to die

404
01:04:48,514 --> 01:04:49,879
Together with her lover

405
01:04:52,484 --> 01:04:54,714
I didn't want to leave alone

406
01:04:55,687 --> 01:04:58,417
I wanted Jack to die with me

407
01:05:00,726 --> 01:05:03,160
That's why I cut myself so deep

408
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:07,098
I can't be without him

409
01:05:12,471 --> 01:05:14,803
The three of you saved his life

410
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,770
Listen to me.
No one can help them

411
01:05:17,009 --> 01:05:19,569
Whoever helps them has to die!

412
01:06:32,184 --> 01:06:33,310
Lok!

413
01:06:48,734 --> 01:06:49,666
The patient is gone!

414
01:06:49,868 --> 01:06:52,837
Get him! Hurry...

415
01:06:54,039 --> 01:06:56,633
Sit down! Sit...

416
01:07:14,359 --> 01:07:15,951
Give him the beads

417
01:07:28,173 --> 01:07:29,367
Lok

418
01:07:32,978 --> 01:07:34,104
Lok!

419
01:07:38,884 --> 01:07:39,942
Master

420
01:07:40,185 --> 01:07:42,619
you know what will happen

421
01:07:43,121 --> 01:07:44,486
Why help them?

422
01:07:45,691 --> 01:07:48,683
Just because we know
what destiny holds for us

423
01:07:48,894 --> 01:07:51,488
Doesn't mean we can escape it

424
01:07:51,797 --> 01:07:52,559
Whether or not they can be saved

425
01:07:52,864 --> 01:07:54,297
depends on their destiny

426
01:08:01,106 --> 01:08:04,200
That ghost really loves
her boyfriend too much

427
01:08:04,443 --> 01:08:06,377
We can only save the woman

428
01:08:06,612 --> 01:08:08,307
I hope she will leave your son alone

429
01:08:51,657 --> 01:08:53,124
Master, someone's moving the corpse!

430
01:10:20,512 --> 01:10:23,777
Joy, help me!

431
01:10:24,249 --> 01:10:25,978
Kill Jack for me!

432
01:10:26,351 --> 01:10:28,285
We love each other

433
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:30,019
He wants to die

434
01:10:30,255 --> 01:10:32,086
because he wants to be with me!

435
01:10:38,830 --> 01:10:40,821
Lok!

436
01:10:41,633 --> 01:10:42,827
Master!

437
01:10:43,602 --> 01:10:45,502
Joy, you understand

438
01:10:45,871 --> 01:10:47,532
Do you remember
when you were young

439
01:10:47,739 --> 01:10:49,604
Your mom killed your dad
the same way

440
01:10:50,008 --> 01:10:51,475
Because she loved your dad?

441
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:53,678
She didn't want your dad
to leave you

442
01:10:54,846 --> 01:10:56,177
Love him...

443
01:10:57,616 --> 01:10:59,550
Lok... what are you doing?

444
01:10:59,751 --> 01:11:01,912
Lok, what is it?

445
01:11:02,187 --> 01:11:05,588
Joy, this is love. You know it

446
01:11:06,725 --> 01:11:10,718
No, my mom shouldn't have
killed my dad!

447
01:11:11,496 --> 01:11:13,760
Why is this happening?

448
01:11:13,999 --> 01:11:16,729
Master... save him! Master...

449
01:11:17,169 --> 01:11:20,104
Help me... kill him

450
01:11:22,908 --> 01:11:26,901
Joy, you shouldn't try and
protect him

451
01:11:27,612 --> 01:11:29,102
You'll regret it

452
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:53,660
What are you doing?

453
01:11:54,473 --> 01:11:56,703
Why did you break the string of beads?

454
01:12:41,152 --> 01:12:42,380
Lok...

455
01:12:43,989 --> 01:12:47,925
Don't be afraid. Dad is here

456
01:13:03,108 --> 01:13:05,269
My son didn't hurt anybody!

457
01:13:06,344 --> 01:13:08,505
He always tries to help people

458
01:13:09,114 --> 01:13:11,173
Why are you doing this to him?

459
01:13:11,883 --> 01:13:13,248
He's my only son!

460
01:13:13,518 --> 01:13:14,985
Let him go!

461
01:13:15,687 --> 01:13:17,678
If you want to take a life, take mine!

462
01:13:18,323 --> 01:13:22,316
Just let him go, please!

463
01:13:33,004 --> 01:13:37,941
Take my life...

464
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:40,510
Let him go

465
01:13:45,417 --> 01:13:46,679
Lok...

466
01:13:46,918 --> 01:13:48,476
No...

467
01:13:48,853 --> 01:13:50,081
Lok, are you still here?

468
01:13:50,322 --> 01:13:51,949
Open the door, Lok!

469
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:53,288
Uncle, I'm Joy, open up!

470
01:13:53,558 --> 01:13:54,286
No... Run...

471
01:13:54,526 --> 01:13:55,493
Let me see Lok!

472
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:57,521
Don't touch my son...

473
01:13:57,896 --> 01:13:59,955
I'm not a ghost. I'm Joy!

474
01:14:04,469 --> 01:14:06,801
Go! Get out!

475
01:14:07,038 --> 01:14:08,528
Don't you dare touch my son!

476
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:12,632
Go... what should we do?

477
01:14:19,351 --> 01:14:22,616
Go in. Don't be afraid.
Dad is here

478
01:14:33,298 --> 01:14:34,526
Lok

479
01:14:35,634 --> 01:14:37,568
Lok, open up!

480
01:14:37,836 --> 01:14:39,531
Lok...

481
01:15:05,964 --> 01:15:08,592
Help... is anybody here? Help...

482
01:15:09,067 --> 01:15:10,466
Help! Anyone here?

483
01:15:10,702 --> 01:15:12,761
Anyone here? Help... anyone?

484
01:15:13,438 --> 01:15:16,896
Anyone?

485
01:15:17,142 --> 01:15:18,404
Help!

486
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:20,507
Anyone? Help...

487
01:15:54,979 --> 01:15:59,006
Lok...

488
01:16:08,927 --> 01:16:10,189
Lok

489
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:19,359
Lok...

490
01:16:44,429 --> 01:16:45,327
Miss!

491
01:17:00,678 --> 01:17:01,736
Joy...

492
01:17:04,516 --> 01:17:05,778
Joy...

493
01:17:17,595 --> 01:17:26,401
Joy...

494
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:47,490
We love each other

495
01:17:50,829 --> 01:17:52,296
Joy, help me!

496
01:17:53,064 --> 01:17:55,089
Your mom killed your dad
the same way

497
01:17:55,934 --> 01:17:57,162
I'm Yau Yin Ping

498
01:17:59,037 --> 01:18:00,937
Kill Jack for me!

499
01:18:01,639 --> 01:18:03,300
Joy, no!

500
01:18:04,542 --> 01:18:05,839
Help me!

501
01:18:07,445 --> 01:18:09,640
I know my illness can't be cured

502
01:18:09,848 --> 01:18:11,577
So this is the only way
we can come together

503
01:18:11,816 --> 01:18:13,579
We love each other

504
01:18:16,721 --> 01:18:18,746
We just want together!

505
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:21,085
The girl looked at us

506
01:18:23,161 --> 01:18:24,287
Joy

507
01:18:33,271 --> 01:18:36,035
Joy, help me, please!

508
01:18:37,108 --> 01:18:39,008
Help me, please!

509
01:18:49,988 --> 01:18:52,252
Help...

510
01:18:52,690 --> 01:18:54,624
Open up...

511
01:18:59,964 --> 01:19:02,228
Open up!

512
01:21:03,554 --> 01:21:05,545
I'm here to kill him for you

513
01:21:05,857 --> 01:21:07,290
Let go of Joy!

514
01:21:43,161 --> 01:21:44,492
I've been certified insane

515
01:21:45,730 --> 01:21:47,664
If I kill someone,
I don't have to go to jail

516
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:55,177
Do I know you?

517
01:24:59,023 --> 01:25:00,149
Of course

518
01:25:11,002 --> 01:25:12,299
Think...

519
01:25:19,176 --> 01:25:21,337
We donated blood together that night

520
01:25:26,417 --> 01:25:27,645
Do I know you?

521
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,010
I don't think I've seen you before

522
01:25:31,822 --> 01:25:33,221
Tell me if I know you

523
01:25:33,457 --> 01:25:34,253
Please tell me

524
01:25:34,525 --> 01:25:35,651
Of course you do

525
01:25:35,893 --> 01:25:38,327
Why else would I be here
listening to you all this time?

526
01:25:38,729 --> 01:25:39,718
Right?

527
01:25:54,145 --> 01:25:56,943
Lok...

528
01:25:57,248 --> 01:25:58,306
Lok!

529
01:25:59,183 --> 01:26:00,309
Lok!

530
01:26:22,039 --> 01:26:24,132
Which school did you go to?

531
01:26:36,887 --> 01:26:38,582
Where do you live?

532
01:26:51,369 --> 01:26:55,806
My name's Joy. What's yours?

533
01:27:03,047 --> 01:27:04,412
What did you see?

534
01:27:06,083 --> 01:27:08,415
I going upstairs to work

535
01:27:09,053 --> 01:27:11,248
I saw a woman come in

536
01:27:13,124 --> 01:27:15,149
A woman? Was she alone?

537
01:27:15,426 --> 01:27:17,087
She told me that
she was following a man

538
01:27:17,361 --> 01:27:18,385
Did you see him?

539
01:27:19,663 --> 01:27:22,757
No, she was alone

540
01:27:25,269 --> 01:27:26,600
Are you sure?

541
01:27:30,775 --> 01:27:32,436
She was all by herself

542
01:27:40,751 --> 01:27:41,479
Miss!
