1
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,626
Dolan? Dolan!

2
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,801
- Sorry about that bump.
- Bump? What bump?

3
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:35,507
Now you're awake, you gonna come
up here and trail me or not?

4
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,914
I'm a passenger, not a driver.

5
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,295
Jump!

6
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:08,399
Huh, took you long enough
to get him.

7
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,909
Didn't. He moves like an Apache.

8
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,605
- You must be getting old.
- Must be.

9
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,308
- Let's see the damage
- I've had worse.

10
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,408
Shut up and lean back.

11
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,849
Tie this thing, will ya?

12
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,788
How do you figure it, Ben?
Why the bushwhack?

13
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:27,020
That's it, ask fool questions
while I bleed to death.

14
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,655
Well, he didn't try to kill us.
Mean anything to you?

15
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,791
Means you're figurin'
on buryin' me here.

16
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:40,762
Get that coach up on its four
legs and get me-

17
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,033
I hope you've fainted,
but I doubt it.

18
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,229
Who is it?

19
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,595
It's Claire, Mr. Flood.

20
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:20,139
Hi!

21
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:23,012
I told you to be here
when I got back.

22
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,210
Don't be mad.
Look what I bought.

23
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,378
The latest thing from the east.

24
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,320
Sorry, I wanted to surprise you.

25
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,518
When I say do
something, you do it.

26
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:36,050
- I thought-
- I'll say when to think.

27
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:39,087
I just wanted to look
especially nice for you.

28
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,293
That's all it was, Mr. Flood.

29
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,360
I swear.

30
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,871
All right, Claire, honey.

31
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,272
How you gonna look especially
nice if you cry, huh?

32
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:53,039
I wouldn't ever do anything
against you, Mr. Flood.

33
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,013
That's the honest truth.

34
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,708
What'd you buy, honey?

35
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,011
Can I show you?

36
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,213
If it's something
to put on, put it on.

37
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,187
- Mr. Flood?
- Yarbrough.

38
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:09,752
Glad you're back.
We run into a little trouble.

39
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,423
Go on.

40
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:17,732
This mornin', one
of the new men, Toby Wheelock,

41
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,295
started roughing up
that storekeeper, McGivern.

42
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,499
That's your job.

43
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,305
I know, but sometimes
them young fellas

44
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,574
is always tryin'
to make a name for themselves.

45
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,103
How bad is McGivern?

46
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,116
It ain't McGivern,
it's Wheelock.

47
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,914
That storekeeper killed
him with a pitchfork.

48
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,285
McGivern knew Wheelock
was one of my men.

49
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:41,485
Now that puppy-dog deputy's
tryin' to take hisself serious.

50
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,791
Says he's gonna
hold McGivern for trial.

51
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,460
That's good enough.
He's entitled to a fair trial.

52
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,770
- Whatever you say, Mr. Flood.
- That's the law.

53
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:57,504
How long will it take you to
round up a jury?

54
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,977
Oh, 10, 15 minutes.

55
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,870
Make that a half-hour.

56
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:04,177
Right, Mr. Flood.

57
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,952
Jace! You see anything?

58
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:17,288
I swear, I just don't know
what got into me.

59
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,733
Stupid, that's what I am,
just plain stupid.

60
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,826
No argument from me.

61
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,148
I was just mindin'
my own business...

62
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,819
and he comes in,
he starts shovin' me around.

63
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,591
Like a fool, I...
I lose my temper and-

64
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,071
Here they come.

65
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,812
I should've left town after
the sheriff got bushwhacked.

66
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,479
But you didn't, Jace.
Remember that, you didn't.

67
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:12,382
Just wishin', Charlie,
that's all.

68
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:15,615
Open up, Jace.
I want McGivern.

69
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,818
He's my prisoner,
Mr. Flood. Nobody gets him.

70
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,088
You're proteCTing
a murderer, Jace.

71
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:24,221
That's my job.
He gets a fair trial.

72
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,891
Good. The town's
gonna try him right now.

73
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,196
No, sir. The 1st of the month,
when the circuit judge comes.

74
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,728
That's fair enough.

75
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:39,604
I mean... Well, a week or so
won't make too much difference.

76
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,237
Will it, Mr. Flood?

77
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:45,614
Hear that, Jace?
McGivern's got friends out here.

78
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:48,051
Sure. But I gotta
wait for the judge.

79
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:52,483
You've got exaCTly one minute
to open that door, Deputy,

80
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,619
or Ned will drop this package
down that chimney...

81
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,129
and open it for you.

82
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,901
50 seconds.

83
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:14,811
40 seconds.

84
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,218
30 seconds.

85
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:25,822
Jace! Give me a gun
and let me out!

86
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,225
20 seconds.

87
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:33,630
Can't, Charlie. I'll do my best,
I promise you that.

88
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,524
10 seconds.

89
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:48,006
You pointin'
that Winchester at me, sonny?

90
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,641
I'm orderin' you
to leave, Mr. Flood.

91
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,616
You drop that gun
and get out of my way now.

92
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,522
If your men kill me,
I'll take you with me.

93
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:10,293
Then we'll both be dead.
Your choice, sonny.

94
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,300
You make it.

95
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:29,147
Looks like this tin is a little
too heavy for you, sonny.

96
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,790
All right,
that's enough.

97
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,030
Folks, a town without
a duly-eleCTed sheriff...

98
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,935
becomes a lawless town.

99
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:48,337
I propose we eleCT
a sheriff right now.

100
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,604
I nominate Jess Torrey.

101
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:54,579
- Simms, you wanna second it?
- Yeah, I second it.

102
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,012
Good. Any other nominations?

103
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,582
Ryan?

104
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,053
You wanna nominate anybody?

105
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,058
You're a man that usually
has something to say.

106
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,320
Got any suggestions?

107
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:13,325
You?

108
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,266
Well, it looks like
it's unanimous there, Jess.

109
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:19,237
Congratulations. Do a good job.

110
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:22,468
I aim to Mr. Flood.
Startin' now.

111
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,306
Yarbrough, Simms.
I'm deputizin' you.

112
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,869
Murderer in there wants a trial.

113
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,746
All right, let's pick a jury.

114
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,548
Johnson, Ramirez...

115
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:42,184
No. No! NO!!

116
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:45,220
The law says you gotta
give me a trial!

117
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,700
McGIVERN: Jace! Jace!

118
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:52,636
For God's sake,
stop 'em! Stop 'em!

119
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,137
Jace!

120
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:01,110
All right.
This man killed Toby Wheelock.

121
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,478
In self defence.

122
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:06,349
A man's got a right to defend
himself and his property.

123
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,376
Sheriff.
Jury?

124
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,717
Guilty!

125
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:14,192
No! Jace! I told you, I was
just tryin' to defend myself!

126
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,217
Jace! Somebody help me!

127
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,333
Turn him loose!

128
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:31,776
Now, Molly, honey,
a hangin's no place for you.

129
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,472
There won't be a hangin'.

130
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,776
Jury says there will.
It's all legal.

131
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,742
Tell your men
to turn McGivern loose.

132
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:43,346
You're interrupting
justice, Molly.

133
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,153
Not one more step.
Now, turn him loose.

134
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:50,886
Oh!

135
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,023
Feels just like
old times, honey.

136
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,060
Let me go!

137
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,096
Ooh! Let go!

138
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,641
Get on with it.
SIMMS: Right, Mr. Flood.

139
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,165
Boys?

140
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,152
Whoa.

141
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,713
Yee-hoo hoo hoo!

142
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,071
Hey, friend?
Yeah?

143
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,444
Where's the Lang & Hickman
stage office?

144
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:16,573
Huh?

145
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,850
Do you know where
the Lang stage office is?

146
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,252
Down that street, goin' south.

147
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,280
Much obliged.

148
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,751
I'm sure glad
to see you, Mr. Hickman.

149
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:06,288
My name's Dolan. Hickman's
been shot. Get a doCTor.

150
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,768
Oh... Well, how bad is he?

151
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,203
- Get a doCTor.
- Oh, yeah.

152
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:16,935
The top of the stairs,
the room to your right!

153
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:24,407
HICKMAN: Uhh... Oww!

154
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,450
He'll need some tendin', Molly.

155
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,955
I'll take care of him.

156
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,015
Lots of beef broth with barley.

157
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,917
That's one dollar, Mr. Dolan.

158
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,656
She'll pay it.

159
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:40,494
I have some money downstairs.

160
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:44,593
Tell me, doc. Do you have
many hangin's in this town?

161
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:45,660
Can't say.

162
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,901
The fella strung up
in the plaza, what'd he do?

163
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:52,536
I wouldn't know.
He oughta be up in a week or so.

164
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:56,378
Hope so. D'you always
leave them dangling overnight?

165
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,973
Never noticed.

166
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,713
Any particular reason
you never noticed?

167
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:04,314
Yes, Mr. Dolan.
My wife and children.

168
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,990
Oh, Ben.

169
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,996
You've been had.

170
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,239
Thanks for coming, Dan.

171
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:25,437
Not at all, Molly. Don't you
worry, he'll be all right.

172
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:15,923
I helped myself to a cup
of coffee. Hope you don't mind.

173
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:19,761
- How long since you ate?
- This morning, King City.

174
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,292
I've got some cold ham.

175
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,063
Thank you, that'd be fine.

176
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,764
Good.

177
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,468
I'm sorry about Mr. Hickman.

178
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,340
Ah, those things happen.

179
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,345
I know who did it.

180
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,869
Looks good.

181
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:38,075
Don't you want to know?

182
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,609
- Not particularly.
- Oh.

183
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:46,556
Ma'am, do you know what you do
when you walk into a bad bar

184
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:49,584
and the hairs
behind your neck stick up?

185
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,223
Get your drink, pay for it,
turn around and walk out.

186
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,298
And this is a bad bar?

187
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,001
Yes, ma'am.
Jericho is a bad bar.

188
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:07,044
As soon as Ben's up to it,
him and me'll be leavin'.

189
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,206
But he shot Mr. Hickman.

190
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,648
He's been shot before.

191
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,852
All right, if it'll
make you feel better, who?

192
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,517
Flood. Alex Flood.

193
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,959
- Is he in Jericho?
- Do you know him?

194
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,259
Yeah, I heard of him.

195
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,697
Why did you
write Ben that letter?

196
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:31,499
I knew his reputation
as a marshal before he retired.

197
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,368
Ben's past sixty.

198
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:36,772
He didn't decide to retire,
they retired him.

199
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,833
- I didn't know that.
- True.

200
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,141
But I never lied to him.

201
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,172
I told him the line
was in trouble.

202
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,646
He didn't tell you?

203
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,380
Not a word.

204
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,889
Oh.

205
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,086
Sure knew your man, though.
Tell Ben there's trouble...

206
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,618
and he's 20 years younger.
He couldn't wait to get here.

207
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:01,394
Did he mention
he had an ex-deputy with him?

208
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:02,832
Yeah.

209
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,859
So you figured I'd come along...

210
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,872
and you'd get two
for the price of one.

211
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,136
Yes, I thought of that.

212
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:11,836
Thank you, ma'am.

213
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,677
Mr. Dolan, when we pick up
the passengers...

214
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,376
at the relay station,
we'll be back in business.

215
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,749
How? Piggyback?

216
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,653
We'll patch up the coach
and start Monday.

217
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:24,986
We can do it.

218
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:31,226
I've got $400 invested in that
coach. That's as far as I go.

219
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,891
No sense throwing
good money after bad.

220
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:37,060
I'm a gambler,
I play the percentages.

221
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,536
And I don't like the odds.

222
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,597
Then there's nothing
more I can say.

223
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,233
No, ma'am.

224
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,449
What happened to your husband?

225
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,577
Husbands.
I've been widowed twice.

226
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,053
They die in bed?

227
00:20:56,088 --> 00:21:00,081
My first got hit by a stray
bullet in a drunken gunfight.

228
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,094
Frank got his head
kicked in by a colt,

229
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,459
out in the corral.

230
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:08,490
Your husbands don't seem
to have much luck.

231
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,558
They thought different.

232
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,331
They say so?

233
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,464
I know so.

234
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,133
Been a widow very long?

235
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,737
Not long enough
for it to bother me.

236
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,712
So don't let it bother you.

237
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,647
I wasn't going to.

238
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,309
Any more questions?

239
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,840
Yes.

240
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:32,015
Where do I sleep?

241
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:35,390
The spare room's
to the left. The bed's made.

242
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,418
Thank you. Good night.

243
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,598
Mr. Dolan?

244
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,623
Good night, Miss Lang.

245
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,035
How you feelin'?

246
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,844
Hmph. Lousy barley.

247
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,440
Man can't eat this slop,

248
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,474
'lessen he can wash it down.

249
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,421
I'll see what I can do.

250
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:17,028
Howdy. False rumor, Jess.

251
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,833
We heard Molly's
new partner was shot.

252
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:22,203
You heard right.
Ben Hickman, he's upstairs.

253
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,641
The old marshal? One of
the greats in his time, Jess.

254
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,939
Still better than most.

255
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:29,970
- A good friend of yours?
- Sort of partners.

256
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,381
- My name's Dolan.
- Oh, I'm Flood.

257
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,250
This is Sheriff Torrey.

258
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,350
Molly's in town.

259
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,858
Looking for a wheel
for that coach.

260
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,964
- Back watchers?
- Deputies.

261
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:54,529
Jess always keeps 'em handy.
How many you got, Jess?

262
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,507
14, Mr. Flood.

263
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,374
We need 'em to keep the peace.

264
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:00,901
No guns allowed in town.

265
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,355
You lookin' for something?

266
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,326
- Whiskey.
- Not there. Try the cupboard.

267
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:23,965
No, on the right. Second shelf.

268
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:28,102
Thanks.

269
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:33,134
Want me to question
the old man now, Mr. Flood?

270
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:36,443
I don't know. Dolan?
How's the Marshal feeling?

271
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:37,948
Good enough.

272
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,918
Well, ask him if he's up
to answering some questions.

273
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,283
Sure.

274
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,825
Ben.

275
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,696
The sheriff's downstairs.
Wanna see him?

276
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,201
Why, sure. Why not?

277
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:59,465
What the hell you call that?

278
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:02,405
That's no drink. Give me
my regular three fingers.

279
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,375
You want it or not?

280
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,706
You're rattlesnake-mean, Dolan.

281
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:13,081
The sheriff's with a friend
of Mrs. Lang's named Flood.

282
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,713
- You owe me two fingers.
- She mention him to you?

283
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:19,724
I never talked to her
before this morning..

284
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:23,922
- You didn't answer me.
- You didn't give me my drink!

285
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,095
HICKMAN: Her comin' home.

286
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:43,946
Did you give her the money
to buy a new wheel?

287
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,109
She got us a new wheel?

288
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,849
Get out, Flood.

289
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,018
- That's no way to talk.
- I said get out.

290
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,290
And take your hangman with you.

291
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,856
I think this batch of cookies
has too much vanilla in, honey.

292
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,560
Mr. Dolan, kick him out.

293
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:05,866
Never step in between close
friends or argue with the law.

294
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:08,168
You can't blame her
for being excited, Dolan.

295
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:10,504
Longest run
of tough luck I ever saw.

296
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,737
And Molly,
you just say the word,

297
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:15,610
I'll have you
a new coach for that run.

298
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:16,944
That's a nice offer.

299
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:20,680
For 51% of the line?
Go to hell, Flood.

300
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,914
I'll be rolling
on schedule without you.

301
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:26,856
I hope so, Molly, I really do.
But the way your luck's been.

302
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:29,622
My only bad luck
is you're not dead yet.

303
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:30,821
Miss Lang.

304
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,457
You have a sick man upstairs.
At least take care of him.

305
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,797
Do I go along, Mr. Flood?

306
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,303
He's fit.

307
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,931
"Do I go along, Mr. Flood?"

308
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,498
"Do I go on breathing,
Mr. Flood?"

309
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,841
"Do I go on living, Mr. Flood?"

310
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:50,211
Feisty, but loveable.
Sit down, Dolan.

311
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,684
Thanks, but...

312
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,180
I like the view
better over here.

313
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,125
Of course. Have one.

314
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,923
All right.

315
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,362
You swing a lot of weight
around here.

316
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:10,334
Only 51% of everything I touch.
Except the Lang Stage Line.

317
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:11,960
Lang & Hickman.

318
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,664
Oh, the paint'll wear off.

319
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,902
Hickman's deputy
in Santa Fe, weren't you?

320
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,034
Used to be.

321
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:21,739
40 a month, every month
you're alive to colleCT it.

322
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,543
Is that why you quit Abeline?

323
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:27,416
Oh, I got 50 a month.
Now I got a town, Dolan.

324
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,521
Town, cattle,
part of a mine, territory...

325
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:35,086
It brought me entertainment
and I stayed to take my profits.

326
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:37,686
It's tamed?

327
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:40,289
I don't think you'll
hear any complaints.

328
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:41,765
With one exception.

329
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:45,195
Don't you think
she can be tamed?

330
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:47,101
Hadn't thought about it.

331
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,936
No? After sleeping under
the same roof?

332
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:57,574
- It's a big roof.
- Small town, Dolan.

333
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,982
I tell you what,
the hotel's full up-

334
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,986
- Your hotel.
- Only 51%.

335
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,988
I'll tell 'em
you're comin' over...

336
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,320
and they'll fix somethin'
special for you.

337
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:07,450
Real thoughtful.

338
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,651
Ex-lawman to ex-lawman,
it's my pleasure.

339
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,060
Mr. Flood?

340
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:14,759
Seems the old man didn't
see the bushwhacker.

341
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,596
But he said maybe he did.

342
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:21,405
Ex-lawman to ex-lawman,
I wouldn't recognise him...

343
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:24,567
if I was sitting
in the same room with him.

344
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,941
But you know something,
Flood? You're right.

345
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,413
A little too much vanilla
in those cookies.

346
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:37,182
Dolan, when you get in town
you look me up, huh?

347
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,053
Ace Deuce Palace.

348
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:40,174
GIRL: Try your luck?

349
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,378
Maybe later.

350
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,566
I'll take three.

351
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:19,188
Just looked over your 51%.

352
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,122
Very nice.

353
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,285
Hotel says you didn't show.

354
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:24,318
Couldn't.
Ben worried about his health.

355
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,922
Oh, when Hickman worries,
you worry?

356
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,126
Used to be the other way round.

357
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:31,691
Like to sit in?

358
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:34,603
Uh-uh. Buy you a drink instead.

359
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:38,439
Uh-uh. My place,
I'll do the buying.

360
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:40,501
I was hopin' you'd say that.

361
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:43,742
What's that "uh-uh" mean?

362
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,047
I don't like the odds.
banana nose deals sliders.

363
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,618
Sure?

364
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:52,145
It's my business to be sure.

365
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:54,822
Harv!

366
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,622
Yes? What?

367
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:04,769
Table Five, Joey Ross.
He's all thumbs. Fire him.

368
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,499
- Fire him?
- Yeah, fire him.

369
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,737
Yes, sir.

370
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:14,438
Have you found out yet
who ambushed you?

371
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:18,313
Injuns? Hold-up crew?

372
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,146
I figure Indians,

373
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,949
or somebody with just
about as much know-how.

374
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,818
Ever do any Injun fightin'?

375
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:25,845
Little.

376
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:29,959
You know, I was thinkin',
you walk like an Indian.

377
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,930
Lived with them
a long time back.

378
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,598
May I?

379
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:43,129
Certainly, Claire. Have a drink.

380
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,801
Thank you, Mr. Flood.

381
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,470
This is Dolan.

382
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,672
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dolan.

383
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,442
Likewise, Miss Claire.

384
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,676
You like my friend, honey?

385
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:55,117
Do you want me to like him?

386
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:58,850
No. Dolan knows I share
nothing with nobody.

387
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,223
'Cept whiskey and cookies.

388
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,453
Joan?

389
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:10,362
Would you like to
meet a girl, Mr. Dolan?

390
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:15,466
Thank you, ma'am.
I'll let you know if I do.

391
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:16,837
Here's to fun and-

392
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,400
You hear
what he's sayin', Curly?

393
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:20,638
Hand it over.

394
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,771
And who's gonna make me?

395
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:25,044
Just obeyin' orders.
You gotta check it.

396
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,517
- This gun stays.
- Hey, big man.

397
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,788
The law says no guns.

398
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,120
You the law?

399
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:37,058
No, I am.

400
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:39,290
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

401
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,389
Well, I don't see no badge.

402
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:46,392
I don't need no badge, bigmouth.
It's up there on the ledge.

403
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,201
He levellin', Curly?

404
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,236
He's levellin'.

405
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:59,978
OK, friend, you win.

406
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:03,181
All of 'em, mister.
Under the coat.

407
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,553
Sure, why in the hell not?

408
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,956
- You.
- Clean.

409
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:10,290
The knife inside your boot.

410
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:12,729
Flood!

411
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:43,716
Harv?

412
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,328
Ditch him.

413
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:48,992
Boys! Get him out of here.

414
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,430
The louse cut you.

415
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,199
Go get me another jacket,
will you, honey?

416
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:57,139
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Grey jacket.

417
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,541
Thanks for the yell, Dolan.

418
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,070
Old habit.

419
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:07,278
Man's back's a tender spot.

420
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,183
You did all right.

421
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,245
Is that why you didn't step in?

422
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:14,452
Steppin' in's a habit I outgrew.

423
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,323
Smart.

424
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:20,195
Helps a man
stay alive a long time.

425
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:24,532
Phil?

426
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:28,027
Lock him up. We'll hang him
after the trial.

427
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:34,470
Jericho's a law-abidin'
town, Dolan.

428
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,208
Here's to law and order.

429
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:59,567
Good morning.

430
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:03,300
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

431
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:07,569
What would you like
for breakfast?

432
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:11,673
Same as Ben. His plate's so
clean, I can't tell what it was.

433
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,206
Just ham and eggs.

434
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,679
Ben, he goes for home cooking.

435
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,080
You don't?

436
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:21,180
No, ma'am.

437
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:26,252
It's Frank Ryan and his boy,
they have the general store.

438
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,128
They're good friends of mine.

439
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,827
They'd like to meet you.

440
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:33,202
I won't be around long
enough to make friends.

441
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,400
We can beat him, Mr. Dolan.
Believe me, we can.

442
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:43,039
You can't.
I saw the town last night.

443
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,379
Monday, Ben and me'll be gone.

444
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,850
Oh. Ben say so?

445
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:49,910
He will when he hears the count.

446
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:52,422
And I
can go to the devil?

447
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:56,086
Or to Flood. All you have
to do is say the word.

448
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,186
I have. The word is never.

449
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:00,454
It wasn't always.

450
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:06,200
No, not when he first came here
to do a job that needed doing.

451
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:08,501
Stopped all the killings
and stealing.

452
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:11,235
Everybody in this town
looked up to him.

453
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,039
We were mistaken.
Me most of all.

454
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:18,310
49% of something is better
than 100% of nothing.

455
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:19,816
No.

456
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,682
Your choice.

457
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:27,947
If I get help, six men
or more, good men,

458
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:30,051
then will you stay on?

459
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:31,254
Merchants?

460
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,695
We're gonna have a meeting
at Ryan's place.

461
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:36,461
Sheep against wolves.
Talk sense.

462
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,093
You have two choices,

463
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,071
give Flood what he wants
or pack up and move.

464
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:44,802
Everything inside your head
are odds, percentages!

465
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:47,709
You know Flood shot Ben,
but that doesn't matter!

466
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:50,339
You don't like
the odds, so you run!

467
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:53,316
You aren't much
of a man, Mr. Dolan.

468
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:55,242
Miss Lang,

469
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,181
you're burning breakfast.

470
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,019
Oh, damn!

471
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:05,926
Just as well.

472
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:09,228
A man who gets attached to home
cooking can't think straight.

473
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,962
I'll eat breakfast in town.

474
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,560
Mr. Dolan?

475
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,436
Hold off telling Ben
till after the meeting.

476
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:18,465
Give me a chance
to change the odds.

477
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,167
I'm sorry, Miss Lang.

478
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:35,385
Why won't Pa
let me stay up tonight?

479
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:39,362
Your Pa has his reasons.
Now don't you ask again, hear?

480
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,305
Come back to try your luck?

481
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:57,837
Yes, ma'am.

482
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,214
- Pass over for five.
- Without me.

483
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,617
- Call.
- Two, five and ten.

484
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,018
Fold.

485
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:07,385
Pass.

486
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:08,483
Call.

487
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,824
- Cards?
- One.

488
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,021
Dealer takes one.

489
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,827
- Better odds tonight?
- Much.

490
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:17,299
Bet ten.

491
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,997
Call.

492
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:21,231
Kings and treys.

493
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:22,762
Beats jacks and nines.

494
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:25,275
Looks like you know
your business, Dolan.

495
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:26,708
It's a living.

496
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:28,672
Carl?

497
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,013
Yes, Mr. Flood?

498
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:35,109
How much you got
in your bank, Dolan?

499
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:37,177
$462.

500
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:40,315
Bring me $462 out of petty cash.

501
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:42,019
Yes, sir.

502
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:50,923
Out.

503
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,299
Five five.

504
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:53,132
Fold.

505
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,603
Buy you a drink?

506
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,732
No, thanks. Never drink
when I'm working.

507
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,366
Your deal, Mr. Flood.

508
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,413
Didn't expeCT to see you
here tonight, Dolan.

509
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,142
Why not?

510
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:07,480
Figured you'd be
tied up in a meeting.

511
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:11,818
55. What meetin'?

512
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:13,118
Call.

513
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:17,992
Raise 10. Secret meetin'.
Ryan's house, ten o'clock.

514
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,633
Call or raise.

515
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,337
Don't know any Ryans.

516
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:38,746
How much longer do you
intend to wait, Molly?

517
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,774
Miller's usually ahead of time.

518
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:56,666
It's nothing.
I'm sure Miller'll be here soon.

519
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:58,362
Maybe he ain't comin'.

520
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:01,098
Likely he ain't.
His wife's dead set against it.

521
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:04,835
I don't want this to take
any more time than it has to.

522
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,740
So let's get started.

523
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,736
You talk, Dolan.

524
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,872
Right, but softly.

525
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,550
20.

526
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:23,017
I'm feelin' charitable,
in a small way. Raise you 20.

527
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:33,898
Down the street. Ryan's store.

528
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:35,565
Alterations.

529
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:39,835
It's been raised.

530
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:43,141
You callin' or foldin'?

531
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,474
Callin'.

532
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,543
40 more.

533
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,748
Confidence.

534
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:02,924
40... and 60.

535
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:10,263
Go.

536
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:12,632
Two.

537
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:16,936
Same.

538
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,781
That's a nice-lookin' watch.

539
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,884
Runs a few minutes fast.

540
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:34,865
How much you got there?

541
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:37,060
$646.

542
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,763
That's the bet.

543
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,044
Sounds to me like
the meeting's adjourned.

544
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:59,447
That's 646 to you, Dolan.

545
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:04,727
She's all right. Things that
belong to me never get damaged.

546
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:07,887
You callin' my hand?

547
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:17,172
I'd never face myself
if I didn't.

548
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,073
Your call.

549
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,907
- Three of a kind.
- Same.

550
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:22,935
Tens.

551
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,038
Queens.

552
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:29,447
Can't win 'em all.

553
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,949
Your turn to buy.

554
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,856
I'm glad you won, Dolan.

555
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:43,025
That'll give you and the old
marshal travellin' money.

556
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:44,796
And the sooner the better.

557
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:48,293
Or first thing I know,
you and me are liable to...

558
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,772
wind up being friends.

559
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,010
Miss Lang?

560
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:43,224
Are you all right?

561
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:48,488
Go ahead and cry.
You got a right.

562
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:51,023
The last thing I need
is your advice.

563
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:59,798
Easy, it'll knock
you on your ear.

564
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,261
It's my ear.

565
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:19,383
Yarbrough and Simms
really had a great time.

566
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:22,051
They dragged us
out of the house.

567
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:24,151
Aggie Ryan fought like a tiger.

568
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,856
They blew her home to bits.

569
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:32,328
Years of scrimping and saving,
everything they owned.

570
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:36,028
Do you know that...?

571
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:39,375
Ah, you wouldn't.

572
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,837
Maybe I would.

573
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,243
The hell, you would.

574
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:51,585
They made us stand there
while they took Ryan...

575
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:55,285
and in front of his wife and
son, beat him and beat him...

576
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:57,054
and beat him.

577
00:44:57,094 --> 00:45:00,188
First one, then the other.
Laughing all the time.

578
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:03,293
I'm sorry it happened.

579
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,358
Hooray for being sorry.

580
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:09,068
Mr. Dolan, you stink.

581
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:12,542
Go ahead, get it off your chest.

582
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:13,668
Damn right.

583
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:18,876
I've got some things I wanna say
to you, Mr. Dolan. Just a few.

584
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,351
I'm not in any hurry.

585
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:25,045
You can't wait to hightail it
out of Flood's sight.

586
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:26,056
Right.

587
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:29,457
You've got a yellow streak
down your back this wide.

588
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:34,555
- This wide?
- Right.

589
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:36,998
That's what I said.

590
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:42,199
I just don't understand you,
Mr. Dolan. Ben, I understand.

591
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:46,835
Frank and Aggie Ryan.
People all over the world.

592
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:51,712
Even a louse
like Alex Flood I understand.

593
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:55,583
You really are
a stinker, Mr. Dolan.

594
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,201
I know what you're thinking.

595
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:14,898
"I told you so. "
That's what you're thinking.

596
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,764
Sheep.

597
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:24,035
Wolves against sheep.

598
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:29,075
Go on. Why don't you tell
me how right you were?

599
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:34,791
I just don't
understand you, Mr. Dolan.

600
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:40,855
Ben, Aggie, Frank Ryan,
I understand.

601
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:43,924
People all over the world
I understand.

602
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,596
Even Alex Flood.

603
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:53,008
Mr. Dolan, you are a bastard.

604
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:54,601
Mm-hm.

605
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:57,903
I'm going to bed.

606
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:35,111
I'm gonna kiss you.

607
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:42,985
You didn't have to do that.

608
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:03,072
Just can't figure you, Dolan.

609
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,573
Just can't figure you.

610
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:32,873
- Mr. Dolan?
- Mmm?

611
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,846
Somebody oughta
put dynamite down your chimney.

612
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:35,838
Good morning. I'm sorry
I'm late getting started.

613
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:38,238
You and Ben must be starved.

614
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:40,709
Ham steaks and fried
potatoes all round.

615
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:45,537
Get me a jug of that
bacon grease, will you?

616
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:54,654
I could do with
some more firewood,

617
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:56,818
if you're up to chopping it.

618
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:01,621
Any time.

619
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:10,266
Mr. Dolan, if you can't handle
whiskey, you shouldn't drink it.

620
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:15,776
Who put who to bed last night?

621
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:19,308
Hmm?

622
00:50:57,788 --> 00:50:59,187
Oh!

623
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,281
We'll have your breakfast
going soon.

624
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:03,451
No hurry.

625
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:07,089
- Rough night?
- Yeah.

626
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,534
Dolan told me you're pulling out
when you're strong enough.

627
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,766
Thanks for offering
to leave the coach.

628
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:19,275
Don't thank me,
that was Dolan's idea.

629
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:24,211
Kind of a hard fellow
to figure out, ain't he?

630
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,112
Yes, he is.

631
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:28,242
What would you do,
if you were him?

632
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:30,815
That's even harder to figure.

633
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:32,913
Miss Lang?

634
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:36,756
You know something?
I wish I was ten years younger.

635
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:38,818
So do I, Mr. Hickman.

636
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:52,436
Thanks, I'll have breakfast
ready in no time.

637
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:56,207
No, thanks. Think I'll go
into town, get some whiskey.

638
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:58,714
Ben'll be wanting
his three fingers.

639
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:00,113
And we're fresh out.

640
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,482
Comes from having
a drunk in the house.

641
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:04,419
Two.

642
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,391
Visitors.

643
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:19,834
Hired killers.

644
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,861
Badge gives them the license.

645
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:24,864
Mrs. Lang!

646
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:32,670
About this coach. Got some
things I wanna tell you.

647
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:34,684
You mean ordered to tell me.

648
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:36,049
Yeah, that's right.

649
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:38,611
I've been looking forward to it.

650
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:42,386
This paper here says you ain't
paid your bills or the bank.

651
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:43,915
They'll be paid.

652
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:46,829
Hey, get away from that coach.

653
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:50,026
Some coach!
Sure is torn up inside.

654
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:51,795
Don't touch it!

655
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:55,100
- Sure is flimsy, ain't it?
- Leave it alone!

656
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:59,131
You wanna bet I can't
tear this off with one hand?

657
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,041
You wanna bet you don't?

658
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:05,343
You interfering
with the law, Dolan?

659
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:09,011
Uh-uh. I wouldn't think of it.

660
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:11,384
Just proteCTing
private property.

661
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,281
That coach is mine.

662
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:16,656
That's not what this paper says.

663
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,093
Read it yourself.

664
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:21,120
Drop your gun belts.

665
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:26,466
Any time.

666
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:29,537
I never hurry a man
who wants to die.

667
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:32,597
You won't get out
of town alive, Dolan.

668
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:37,409
My problem. Yours is gettin'
out of here. Now, drop it.

669
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:38,505
You too, Yarbrough.

670
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:44,143
Come on.

671
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:59,564
Now, throw 'em
in the horse trough.

672
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,571
You must be crazy, Dolan.

673
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:12,912
You know who we work for.

674
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:14,382
Mm-hm.

675
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:18,146
It's your turn, Dolan.

676
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:20,847
Throw the gun in the trough.

677
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:25,319
Just a little more tightening's
all she'll need.

678
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:40,167
Ahh!

679
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,875
Agh!

680
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:44,693
Ahh!

681
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:47,630
Urgh!

682
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:40,249
Ride him, Mr. Flood! Yahoo!

683
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:46,355
C'mon! Ride 'em, there!

684
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,794
Nice riding, Mr. Flood!

685
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:57,898
Sure likes to jump.
Nasty enough to be mine.

686
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:00,136
Don't look like
she'll stay busted.

687
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:02,872
Well, we'll go round
and round again.

688
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:05,904
And I hope he likes
it same as me.

689
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:31,804
Whoa!

690
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:36,538
You said last night,

691
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:39,343
nothing that belongs
to you ever gets damaged.

692
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:41,405
That's right.

693
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,427
You forgot to tell your men.

694
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,397
What'd you use on 'em?

695
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:03,268
Single tree.

696
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:05,570
Oh... Where's Simms?

697
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:08,270
I don't know.
Probably at the doCTor's.

698
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:11,939
That man was a deputy.

699
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:16,308
The way I look at it,
a man starts choking a woman...

700
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:19,116
is lookin' to go
to hell in a hurry.

701
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:21,180
All I did was oblige him.

702
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,715
Same as you do, Mr. Flood.

703
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:29,893
Well, the problem is
you're you and I'm me.

704
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:31,457
Different privileges.

705
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:34,599
Majority rules.

706
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:37,469
Why don't you clear out?

707
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:39,668
Can't wait to,
soon as Ben's fit.

708
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:41,142
He's fit enough.

709
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:45,011
Why don't you just leave the way
you came in, in this coach?

710
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:47,676
Tomorrow.
About nine or ten o'clock.

711
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:49,184
Whatever's best.

712
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:51,778
Nine o'clock. It's earlier.

713
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,651
You want me to take him with me?

714
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,432
You killed him, you bury him.

715
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,166
Oh, and Dolan?

716
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:13,335
One minute after nine
and I'll hang you.

717
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:17,644
Yah! Yee-ah!

718
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:30,883
Ahh, no question
about it, Dolan.

719
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:35,591
You gotta pull out like he said,
or he'll hang you for sure.

720
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:39,898
A sick man like me, even
Flood'll give me a day or two.

721
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:42,837
No, Dolan, too much
light hurts my eyes.

722
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:45,306
I figured you'd
ride out with me now.

723
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:48,902
Ahh, I wish to God I could.

724
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:52,073
But I'll meet up with
you wherever you say.

725
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:54,174
- Waco.
- All right.

726
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:59,177
Ooh... I could sure use three
fingers to kill this pain.

727
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:00,746
It's that bad, huh?

728
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:02,519
Uh... It comes and goes.

729
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:05,220
No, don't touch... You can't-

730
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,989
I ain't leavin' and I ain't
meetin' up with you.

731
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:12,695
You gave me your word!

732
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:15,727
I know I did.
But I gotta break it.

733
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:18,502
And nothin' you say
will change my mind.

734
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:22,443
Come Monday, that coach is gonna
do what it's supposed to do.

735
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:26,346
- It'll pull out on schedule.
- Stop talking like a fool.

736
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:29,874
If you wanna commit suicide,
get in bed and shoot yourself.

737
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:32,444
At least you'll die comfortable.

738
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:35,548
I came because you asked me.
Now I'm askin' you to leave.

739
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:38,551
You owe me that much, Ben.

740
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:39,925
More.

741
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:44,422
Much more.
But I owe myself too.

742
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:48,403
Any man has to have a reason
to get up in the morning.

743
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:52,465
That's very touching.
We'll put it on your tombstone.

744
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:53,668
"Here lies Ben Hickman,

745
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,110
who needed a reason
to get up in the morning. "

746
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:59,740
What's the matter with you?
Can't you admit you're too old?

747
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:02,608
This isn't Tucson 15 years ago,
this is Jericho.

748
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:06,713
You're 63, in a town full
of guns. Those are the faCTs.

749
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:08,951
You're thinking with this
instead of this.

750
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:11,721
That's when they bury you.
And you know it!

751
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,928
Now, get your gear
and let's get out of here.

752
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:26,638
So long, Dolan.

753
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:29,307
Nothin' but the best to you.

754
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:27,118
We're obliged to you, Mr. Dolan.

755
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:11,734
I never thought
I'd see you again.

756
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:13,605
What are the odds?

757
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:16,874
- You got a glass?
- Got three of 'em.

758
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:20,371
I told Molly we'd be needin'
'em when you got back.

759
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:23,908
Molly! Molly?

760
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:27,586
See?

761
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:31,992
I told you, never argue with the
best friend of a best friend.

762
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:43,466
You know he'll hang you, Dolan?

763
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:44,973
Probably.

764
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:48,067
- Over my dead body.
- Most likely.

765
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,476
Your friend Ryan, will he fight?

766
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:52,879
Oh, he'd die trying.

767
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:56,612
That brings the odds way down.
Only 10 to 1.

768
01:05:58,054 --> 01:06:00,614
Jace. He was aCTing sheriff...

769
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:03,056
until he tried
to stop a lynching.

770
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:04,719
Anybody else?

771
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,126
Nobody that I can think of.

772
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:09,825
Four guns makes it 9 to 1.

773
01:06:09,865 --> 01:06:12,595
8 to 1, you forgot me.

774
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:15,763
Yes, sir.
Just ten years younger.

775
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:47,425
HICKMAN: Ho!

776
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:52,700
Well, I see you're eight minutes
ahead of a rope, huh?

777
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:55,575
To bad we never
got together, Marshal.

778
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:58,273
From what I've been hearing,
it's my pleasure.

779
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:02,045
You got yourself a pretty
hard partner, Dolan.

780
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:05,178
There's still time
to buy you a last drink.

781
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:08,384
Only minutes ahead of a rope
makes swallowing too tough.

782
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:11,450
Maybe we'll run
into each other again some day.

783
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:14,986
You run into me again, you
still won't like the odds.

784
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:17,261
Certain plans I've made
don't include you.

785
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:19,426
We understand each other?

786
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:20,594
Majority rules.

787
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:40,417
Why'd you have to say I was
63 in front of Mrs. Lang?

788
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:42,890
-64, come August.
- Huh.

789
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:45,917
Yah! Yah!

790
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:48,953
Cheer up. We'll be
at Flood's herd pretty soon.

791
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:51,523
You're still not
too old to rustle.

792
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:57,965
Molly, why don't
you simmer down?

793
01:07:58,007 --> 01:07:59,702
Why don't you get out?

794
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:03,109
Now, wait. I came here
real nice, hat in hand-

795
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:04,840
I'm not interested.

796
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:08,913
Molly, I have to treat
everybody the same here.

797
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:12,284
You don't really think
I care about this place?

798
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:15,620
All I want is you, dear.

799
01:08:15,658 --> 01:08:18,718
- For better or worse.
- That's all over, Flood.

800
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,888
It used to be Alex, honey.

801
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,693
You used to be different.

802
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:26,462
Different? A hired gunslinger?

803
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:28,902
No, a lawman, proud of his job.

804
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,771
How can you be proud
on 50 a month?

805
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:34,742
- Is that what you want?
- I did.

806
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:35,869
But not now?

807
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:39,074
- That's right.
- Well, let's find out.

808
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:49,291
Well, you didn't help much.

809
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:51,054
You turn my stomach.

810
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:55,288
- Dolan?
- Is that what you think?

811
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:56,992
I'm asking you.

812
01:08:57,032 --> 01:09:00,001
That's why you ran
him out of town.

813
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:03,937
I didn't like him living under
the same roof with you.

814
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,873
Not just under the same roof.

815
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:08,376
And I loved every minute of it!

816
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:12,844
Ohh...

817
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:22,214
- That's for lying.
- Am I lying?

818
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:28,059
Did he or didn't he?

819
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:29,724
You'll never know.

820
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:31,858
You lousy tramp!

821
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:38,129
Yes or no?

822
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:45,247
If you want that stage
to roll, come see me.

823
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:48,011
Only don't walk, crawl!

824
01:10:03,132 --> 01:10:06,124
Yah! Yah!

825
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:29,716
You like for me to shave you,
don't you, Mr Flood?

826
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:31,658
Among other things I like, yes.

827
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:34,219
Can I ask you
something, Mr Flood?

828
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:35,730
Barber's privilege.

829
01:10:35,764 --> 01:10:37,356
Did she ever shave you?

830
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:40,732
I changed my mind.
I don't like you to shave.

831
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:42,828
I'm sorry.

832
01:10:42,871 --> 01:10:44,031
Who is it?

833
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:45,938
Jess Torrey, Mr Flood.

834
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:47,772
Come in.

835
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:52,106
- Please, Mr Flood, don't-
- Shut up!

836
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:55,009
What's the trouble?

837
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:59,783
50 head are missing from
your south range, Mr Flood.

838
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:02,416
- When?
- Hour or so ago.

839
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:05,427
I just sent six men
out to track 'em.

840
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:07,520
You know, it sure don't figure.

841
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:11,294
Who'd be crazy enough to
run off any of your cattle?

842
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:13,801
Sure makes a man
wonder, doesn't it?

843
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:26,447
HICKMAN: I count six.

844
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:27,972
That's a start.

845
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:33,185
You make a fine cup
of coffee, Mrs Lang.

846
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:36,885
Thanks. I've got some
hard tack, too. Like some?

847
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:38,358
Mmm, yeah!

848
01:11:47,503 --> 01:11:49,130
- Molly.
- Dolan.

849
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:51,867
Torrey sent six men
after the cattle.

850
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:53,397
We saw them.

851
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:55,570
Who did that?

852
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,347
Flood.

853
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:03,184
It's not important.

854
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:05,315
It is to me.

855
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:13,293
Howdy, Ryan.
How are ya?

856
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:16,025
You're Marshal Hickman.
I heard about you-

857
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:20,024
Don't say it. Even if you
heard about me from your daddy.

858
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:21,468
No, sir. I won't.

859
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:25,064
- Glad you're here, Deputy.
- Ex-deputy.

860
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:27,337
Talk like that upsets me, son.

861
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:31,005
A man puts himself down,
sounds to me like an amateur.

862
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:33,014
Probably fights like one.

863
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:36,017
Difference between
an amateur and a professional,

864
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:39,919
professional figures out a way
to cut the odds before he moves.

865
01:12:39,955 --> 01:12:41,946
Now, me and Dolan,
we're professionals,

866
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:44,686
that's why you
and Ryan here are lucky.

867
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:48,254
You're about to become the
beneficiaries of our experience.

868
01:12:48,297 --> 01:12:49,924
Right, Dolan?

869
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:51,398
Right.

870
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:54,027
One of Marshal Hickman's
shorter leCTures.

871
01:12:54,069 --> 01:12:55,764
I'll fight, Mr Hickman.

872
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:57,999
How much dynamite you got, Ryan?

873
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,871
Plenty.

874
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:05,670
Jace, you and Ben hit
the main ranch house.

875
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:08,581
- Ryan-
- Flood owes me a house.

876
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:11,547
All right, Ryan.

877
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:15,079
That leaves you the granary.
I'll take care of the mine.

878
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:19,057
All right. Let's move.

879
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:22,361
Hey, Dolan?

880
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,729
What about me?

881
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:26,826
- You go home.
- Damned, if I will!

882
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:31,238
But first, douse the fire. I can
smell that coffee for a mile.

883
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:51,960
Can I get you somethin'
to eat, Mr Flood?

884
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:53,393
Eh?

885
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:56,364
- Can I get you-
- No, no, no.

886
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:59,663
There oughta be some word
on my cattle by now.

887
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:01,396
I'll go check.

888
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:34,934
Any word?

889
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,801
No, not yet, Mr Flood.

890
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:40,240
But I said they'd better not
come back without your cattle...

891
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:42,539
so I'm sure-

892
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:44,569
Sounded like dynamite!

893
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:58,050
That's not far off.

894
01:14:58,093 --> 01:15:00,027
ExaCTly one mile.

895
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:01,757
Your granary.

896
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:04,095
That first one
was my ranch house.

897
01:15:04,132 --> 01:15:07,101
What the hell's going on here?

898
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:09,535
They're workin' me
over in a circle.

899
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:14,668
Start north with the cattle,
ranch is east, granary south...

900
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:16,678
so next is west.

901
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:18,407
The mine.

902
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:22,611
I want a dozen men
in five minutes. Come on!

903
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:30,609
Come on!

904
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:08,414
Listen.

905
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:10,118
Someone's back!

906
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:13,184
I told you there was
nothing to worry about.

907
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:14,695
Probably want a drink.

908
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:17,494
It's Jace.

909
01:17:17,532 --> 01:17:18,863
You all right, Jace?

910
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,391
Scared, but I'm used to that.

911
01:17:21,436 --> 01:17:22,562
No Dolan?

912
01:17:22,604 --> 01:17:24,367
Nope.

913
01:17:25,774 --> 01:17:28,504
This is gettin'
to look like a wake.

914
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:32,206
I think I'll
stretch out upstairs.

915
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:34,647
Doesn't look too good, does it?

916
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:37,243
He's not worried,
why should we be?

917
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:47,884
- Got his horse.
- He's there.

918
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:53,317
There he is.

919
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:08,839
Dolan! It's hangin' time!

920
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:12,507
He's trapped.

921
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:14,777
We'll go down after him.

922
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:37,359
Suppose Dolan doesn't make it?

923
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:40,027
He will. Relax.

924
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:42,935
Yeah, like you?
How come you didn't sleep?

925
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:44,598
I wasn't tired.

926
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:47,835
It's Dolan.

927
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:04,617
We haven't got much time,
it'll be daylight soon.

928
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:07,059
- Drink up.
- Thanks.

929
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:09,723
Took you long enough
for a simple job.

930
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:10,992
Worried about me?

931
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:13,023
Me? Not a fraCTion.

932
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:17,471
Mr Hickman? Do you always put
black queens on black kings?

933
01:21:17,505 --> 01:21:19,370
Sure. I cheat.

934
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:22,571
And win.

935
01:21:22,611 --> 01:21:26,069
Congratulations. All right,
Jace, give me the run down.

936
01:21:26,114 --> 01:21:29,413
11 men left in town,
counting Simms.

937
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:31,612
Three patrolling,
two at the jail.

938
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:40,654
This where I check
my gun, gentlemen?

939
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:42,822
Joe'll take it, pop.

940
01:21:50,105 --> 01:21:53,666
- Are you jokin'?
- Do I look like it?

941
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:57,371
All right.
Peel 'em off. Hurry up.

942
01:21:57,812 --> 01:22:01,873
...quietly at the bar,
I look over my shoulder-

943
01:22:02,183 --> 01:22:05,448
I just wanna drink.
Some other time.

944
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:08,718
I don't want another time.
Mister, we got laws-

945
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:11,055
All right, what's goin' on-

946
01:22:13,862 --> 01:22:16,057
Now, turn around easy.

947
01:22:22,137 --> 01:22:24,196
Very good.

948
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:25,831
Anytime.

949
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:32,075
There's no sign of 'em.

950
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:33,808
They couldn't
have gotten far.

951
01:22:33,848 --> 01:22:37,113
- Yeah. Where's Phillips?
- Well, he's right back-

952
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:38,176
Phillips?

953
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:42,556
We're short one man
and one horse.

954
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:44,854
Let's get back to town.

955
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:19,292
Wait here. If we don't
come out, you're on your own.

956
01:23:25,934 --> 01:23:27,265
Uh!

957
01:23:27,535 --> 01:23:29,526
He said to wait here.

958
01:23:50,658 --> 01:23:52,387
Try it again.

959
01:24:09,577 --> 01:24:11,602
The set-up's like you said.

960
01:24:11,646 --> 01:24:14,706
Good. Remember, don't move
until you get to 40.

961
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:18,185
Look who's teaching
me how to suck eggs.

962
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:21,382
Difference between a
professional and an amateur.

963
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:27,250
1... 2... 3... 4... 5...

964
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:52,416
Johnny!

965
01:25:24,385 --> 01:25:26,512
Hey, grandpa! Turn in that gun!

966
01:25:27,655 --> 01:25:28,121
Hey!

967
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:52,930
This belongs to you.

968
01:26:54,309 --> 01:26:55,469
Thanks.

969
01:26:58,646 --> 01:27:01,206
Go ahead, Sheriff.
Give 'em hell.

970
01:27:02,684 --> 01:27:05,949
Just stay where
you are, all of you.

971
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:09,650
I got things to say,
and you best listen.

972
01:27:09,691 --> 01:27:13,787
You just got up off the floor
and you're stayin' up.

973
01:27:13,828 --> 01:27:16,991
We been livin'
on our knees long enough.

974
01:27:18,299 --> 01:27:20,494
Damn you! Look at me!

975
01:27:21,502 --> 01:27:24,903
We've been given a chance
to take back our town.

976
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:27,772
Now, who's gonna stand up
and take that chance?

977
01:27:32,447 --> 01:27:34,574
You figure to start
us off, Miller?

978
01:27:36,651 --> 01:27:38,812
- Count me in.
- Me too.

979
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:41,985
- I'll go along.
- So will I.

980
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:45,482
Ryan.

981
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:52,228
You go to the Ace Deuce
and wait'll it's over.

982
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:57,201
All right.

983
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:03,608
Ryan? Can you get a team
and hitch this buckboard?

984
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:05,579
Sure. Right away.

985
01:28:20,194 --> 01:28:21,991
We're all set.

986
01:28:26,501 --> 01:28:28,594
These men are willing to fight.

987
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:30,467
Better than I expeCTed.

988
01:28:30,505 --> 01:28:34,168
Sir, I've changed my mind.
I've got think of my family.

989
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:36,733
- You wanna go home?
- Sure do.

990
01:28:36,778 --> 01:28:38,439
Get.

991
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:43,440
All right, you two
boys come with me.

992
01:28:44,452 --> 01:28:47,853
You, you, get
in the wagon. Jace?

993
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:50,517
Get this rig ready
to block the street.

994
01:28:50,558 --> 01:28:52,219
Right.

995
01:28:54,529 --> 01:28:56,224
Get up on that roof.

996
01:28:57,498 --> 01:29:00,092
Take the middle window
in the hardware store.

997
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:13,306
You all set?

998
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:17,007
I'll tell you when.

999
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:08,432
Evening, Mr Flood.

1000
01:30:17,845 --> 01:30:19,506
Quiet enough.

1001
01:30:20,515 --> 01:30:22,244
Yeah. Let's split up.

1002
01:30:22,283 --> 01:30:24,649
Meet you in front of the hotel.

1003
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:26,585
All right, Mr Flood.

1004
01:31:26,747 --> 01:31:30,877
Mr Flood! Go back!
It's a trap! Go back!

1005
01:31:31,719 --> 01:31:33,050
Yah!

1006
01:31:33,421 --> 01:31:34,683
Yah!

1007
01:33:02,443 --> 01:33:04,377
Ben! Get back!

1008
01:33:20,127 --> 01:33:23,096
I- I...

1009
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:25,155
I... fought for you...

1010
01:33:31,505 --> 01:33:33,769
Hold 'em high!

1011
01:33:33,808 --> 01:33:36,368
- Off your horse!
- Step down.

1012
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:37,468
Come on!

1013
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:45,051
Give me that real easy.

1014
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:49,713
Dolan! It's all over!
We're the-

1015
01:34:04,672 --> 01:34:06,503
Hyah! Hyah!

1016
01:41:16,670 --> 01:41:17,432
Flood!

1017
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:43,928
Dolan...

1018
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:50,837
Don't take less than... 51%.

1019
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:24,593
Hold me

1020
01:42:24,638 --> 01:42:27,937
Now and forever

1021
01:42:27,975 --> 01:42:34,972
And say that we never will part

1022
01:42:35,015 --> 01:42:39,349
My darling, hold me

1023
01:42:39,386 --> 01:42:43,049
Always be tender

1024
01:42:43,090 --> 01:42:50,826
And I will surrender my heart

1025
01:42:50,864 --> 01:42:58,236
Your love is a wondrous thing

1026
01:42:58,272 --> 01:43:05,610
Like the sound
of springtime calling

1027
01:43:05,646 --> 01:43:09,582
Hold me

1028
01:43:09,616 --> 01:43:13,074
End now my sorrows

1029
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:20,959
And make these
tomorrows seem bright

1030
01:43:20,994 --> 01:43:26,660
Tell me that you love me tonight
