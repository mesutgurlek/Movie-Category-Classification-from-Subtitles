1
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,210
McDonald!

2
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:48,690
War party out. Ulzana's gone out.

3
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,570
Ulzana and some others
are out on a raid!

4
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:55,490
Ulzana...

5
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:02,810
Corporal! Get that horse.
Walk him around!

6
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,490
All hell's going to break loose!

7
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,290
Ulzana's going out.

8
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,330
No, I'm not at all anxious to send
a large force after Ulzana

9
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,570
and an unknown number of warriors.

10
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,210
It's embarrassing when the Indian
agent has to guess how many went out.

11
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:43,770
It can't be large party, sir.
They may just trail south to Mexico.

12
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,890
Come in!

13
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,090
Mclntosh is here, sir.
- Send him in.

14
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,890
Morning, Mclntosh.
- Morning, Major.

15
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,411
We had a break at the reservation.
- I heard Ulzana's gone.

16
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,130
His name was mentioned.
- How many more?

17
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,091
Mr. Steegmeyer was uncertain.
He thought maybe 6 or 7.

18
00:05:05,491 --> 00:05:07,490
Hardly a war party.

19
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,251
Coffee hot?
- Help yourself.

20
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,291
Apache war parties come in all sizes.

21
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:18,971
There's the kind with 100 braves,
and the kind with one.

22
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:23,970
Has Major posted the homesteaders?
- As stated in garrison regulations.

23
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,130
How many riders?
- Two.

24
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,091
One riding the north loop,
the other the west.

25
00:05:29,491 --> 00:05:32,971
And how many mounts?
- Captain Gates saw to the details.

26
00:05:35,011 --> 00:05:37,930
How many horses
did you give them, Charlie?

27
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:42,730
One mount each, as specified...
- In garrison regulations.

28
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,771
I know.

29
00:05:46,131 --> 00:05:49,251
Who did you send?
- Mulkearn and Horowitz.

30
00:05:49,651 --> 00:05:54,851
A recruit? - He was duty gallop.
- When did they go?

31
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:57,530
Ten o'clock. They should
be back by late afternoon.

32
00:05:57,931 --> 00:05:59,771
Unless they bring
some of the homesteaders with them.

33
00:06:00,371 --> 00:06:03,491
Their orders didn't specify escort.
- I see.

34
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:08,090
You'd better get up to the agency.
See if you can get more information.

35
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:12,890
Alright. How many troopers
is the major planning to pull out?

36
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:18,531
That's a decision I'll make when
I know the hostile force's strength.

37
00:06:18,931 --> 00:06:21,131
And their probable intention.

38
00:06:21,532 --> 00:06:26,571
Their probable intention is to burn,
maim, torture, rape and murder.

39
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:31,771
Tell Agent Steegmeyer, I want
to know who the guilty parties are.

40
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:34,811
They can't slink back
and escape the consequences again.

41
00:06:35,652 --> 00:06:38,812
It'll take me a couple of hours.
By the time I get back,

42
00:06:39,212 --> 00:06:42,652
and we go out on this trail,
Ulzana will have had over 4 hours.

43
00:06:43,091 --> 00:06:46,571
I will not put a force in the field
in ignorance, Mr. Mclntosh.

44
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:51,091
I just want to be sure
we are going after them.

45
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:55,571
"Any band of hostiles
leaving a US Indian agency

46
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:57,732
will be pursued and apprehended."

47
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:04,491
What we have to determine
is how many of them there are,

48
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,012
and whether they are hostile.

49
00:07:07,411 --> 00:07:12,092
Well, the first is open to question.
The second you can bet money on.

50
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:22,412
He's very forthright.

51
00:07:23,851 --> 00:07:27,172
He's a willful, opinionated man
with a contempt for all discipline,

52
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,972
either moral or military.

53
00:07:30,372 --> 00:07:32,572
He's a good scout
and he knows Apaches,

54
00:07:32,972 --> 00:07:35,771
which I may freely confess,
is more than I do.

55
00:07:36,772 --> 00:07:39,252
Will these two
tell us anything, Ke-Ni-Tay?

56
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:43,171
These two not like you.
He not listen to the words.

57
00:07:43,571 --> 00:07:46,812
Old Nachito, he not like any man.

58
00:07:50,772 --> 00:07:53,252
Ask them what they think of Ulzana.

59
00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:57,532
Ask them, is he a great war chief?

60
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:00,372
Is he wiser than Nana?

61
00:08:04,412 --> 00:08:06,692
Braver than Chato?

62
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:14,092
Is he more cruel than Victorio?

63
00:08:15,492 --> 00:08:18,692
Ask them, does he make his wives
happy in the night?

64
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:23,892
Ask them what they think.

65
00:08:26,893 --> 00:08:28,332
Ask them.

66
00:08:54,332 --> 00:08:57,252
You must have been disappointed,
Lieutenant,

67
00:08:57,652 --> 00:09:00,852
when your orders directed you
to Fort Lowell.

68
00:09:01,252 --> 00:09:04,613
Oh no, sir,
I wanted to see active service.

69
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:10,972
Your father is a man of the cloth?
- Yes, sir.

70
00:09:11,372 --> 00:09:14,252
Is he not a little troubled,

71
00:09:14,652 --> 00:09:18,693
that your vocation differs
so radically from his?

72
00:09:19,572 --> 00:09:24,412
Well sir, my father believes
one can be a Christian and a soldier.

73
00:09:24,812 --> 00:09:26,493
Perhaps.

74
00:09:27,773 --> 00:09:32,492
However, I doubt the Apache Indian
would see Jesus Christ as a leader.

75
00:09:32,892 --> 00:09:36,773
Well sir, my father believes
that it's a lack of Christian feeling

76
00:09:37,173 --> 00:09:40,413
towards the Indian that's
the root of our problems with them.

77
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,933
From a pulpit in Philadelphia,
that's an easy mistake to make.

78
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,413
Sir, I think if they had a chance...
- Lieutenant.

79
00:09:47,813 --> 00:09:51,293
You will take this patrol
in place of Captain Gates.

80
00:09:51,693 --> 00:09:52,772
Sir?

81
00:09:53,173 --> 00:09:56,693
You may have the chance to test
some of your father's theories.

82
00:09:58,413 --> 00:10:00,453
Thank you very much, sir.

83
00:10:00,853 --> 00:10:03,613
Don't thank me.
I'm not giving you a present.

84
00:10:04,013 --> 00:10:07,413
You will leave as soon as
Mr. Mclntosh returns. - Yes, sir.

85
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:13,373
You know what General Sheridan said
of this country, Lieutenant?

86
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:17,013
No, sir. - He said,
if he owned Hell and Arizona,

87
00:10:17,413 --> 00:10:19,653
he'd live in Hell
and rent out Arizona.

88
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,533
I think he said that about Texas, sir.

89
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:26,533
Maybe. But he meant Arizona.

90
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:29,493
Yes, sir.

91
00:10:40,693 --> 00:10:42,693
They're finished.

92
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:48,493
Half of what they say is lies,
the other half ain't true.

93
00:10:49,934 --> 00:10:52,414
Tell them
they speak like true Apaches.

94
00:10:52,814 --> 00:10:56,814
And that I'm glad they didn't go out.

95
00:11:03,894 --> 00:11:06,814
Tell them I'll speak
to the major about the beef.

96
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:22,574
What about it, Mclntosh?
The old man tell you anything?

97
00:11:24,693 --> 00:11:27,133
Old man told me they're getting
short weight on beef, Dutch.

98
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:30,774
What Indian you know wouldn't?
Check my scales any time.

99
00:11:31,174 --> 00:11:32,574
And I'm not Dutch!

100
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:36,974
Well, you look Dutch to me.
I don't give a damn for your scales.

101
00:11:37,374 --> 00:11:40,733
I'm just saying the ones left behind
are wondering if they should have

102
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:45,814
gone too. - What am I meant to do?
Give them extra rations?

103
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:48,254
Just don't water the beef
before you weigh them.

104
00:11:48,654 --> 00:11:51,654
You'd be surprised how many steaks
are in 2 gallons of river water.

105
00:11:52,054 --> 00:11:55,054
Listen, Mclntosh.
Don't tell me how to run my business!

106
00:11:55,454 --> 00:11:57,334
This is my store, not yours!

107
00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:28,575
Please! Please God!

108
00:12:28,975 --> 00:12:33,614
Please help!
In the name of God! Spare me, please!

109
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:36,255
Spare me!

110
00:12:37,895 --> 00:12:41,974
We'll come out right behind you.
Will they send somebody to meet us?

111
00:12:42,374 --> 00:12:46,054
I can't say about that, mister.
I was only told to raise the alarm.

112
00:12:46,454 --> 00:12:50,294
I got 3 kids and a pregnant wife.
I need somebody to bring me in.

113
00:12:50,694 --> 00:12:52,575
Don't anybody care
what happens to us?

114
00:12:53,014 --> 00:12:55,934
I'm sure they do,
they just don't have enough men.

115
00:12:57,895 --> 00:13:01,055
I've got to get going.
I've got another holding to raise.

116
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:05,494
Good luck to you, Mr. Ginsford.
- Good luck, trooper.

117
00:13:20,095 --> 00:13:24,215
Now, now, Abbie.
Not so the girls notice.

118
00:13:25,374 --> 00:13:27,775
Get yourselves ready.

119
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:32,774
We're going to the Fort to see
if any packages have come for us.

120
00:13:33,295 --> 00:13:35,295
Get yourselves dressed.

121
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:40,054
Come on!
Come on girls, get yourselves ready.

122
00:13:40,455 --> 00:13:44,295
We're going to the Fort now to see
if any packages have come for us.

123
00:13:44,695 --> 00:13:46,655
Better get the rest
of our things together, son.

124
00:13:53,295 --> 00:13:55,135
Any sign of the gallopers?

125
00:13:55,895 --> 00:13:58,895
No, they're coming in
with the homesteaders, I guess.

126
00:14:00,735 --> 00:14:01,735
I guess.

127
00:14:02,135 --> 00:14:04,215
You will follow the hostiles until

128
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:08,296
A, they are defeated,
killed, or captured, or

129
00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:11,295
B, they return to the reservation
whereupon you will arrest them, or

130
00:14:11,695 --> 00:14:16,775
C, they cross the international line
into Mexico where the mission ceases.

131
00:14:17,175 --> 00:14:18,335
Clear, Lieutenant?

132
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:21,775
Yes, sir.
- Have any questions? - No, sir.

133
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:23,656
Very well. Carry on.

134
00:14:24,336 --> 00:14:25,815
Lieutenant?
- Yes, sir.

135
00:14:26,215 --> 00:14:29,696
Mr. Mclntosh rides with you
in an advisory capacity. - Yes, sir.

136
00:14:30,096 --> 00:14:33,975
Concerning the trailing of hostiles
and information on the terrain,

137
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,255
you'd be well advised
to heed his advice.

138
00:14:37,655 --> 00:14:42,095
However, in matters purely military,
never forget you command this detail.

139
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:44,056
Of course, sir. Thank you, sir.

140
00:14:45,576 --> 00:14:47,135
So, Harry.

141
00:14:48,135 --> 00:14:51,135
You're eager to be off, I suppose?
- Yes, sir.

142
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:56,895
I strongly advised Major Cartwright
to give you this command.

143
00:14:57,295 --> 00:14:59,696
Thank you, Captain.
- No need to thank me, Harry.

144
00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:05,056
Prepare to mount! Mount!
- Good luck, Lieutenant.

145
00:15:14,776 --> 00:15:16,696
Turn to the left.

146
00:15:21,816 --> 00:15:23,736
Forward! At a walk!

147
00:15:27,455 --> 00:15:29,296
Turn right!

148
00:15:53,936 --> 00:15:56,536
Steady!

149
00:16:06,656 --> 00:16:08,936
It's not for me to tell you,

150
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:13,496
but it'd be better if you came back
with us. It'd give us two guns.

151
00:16:13,896 --> 00:16:19,017
Yeah, yeah. And when I came back,
what would be left, huh?

152
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:22,736
I got stock and I got crops.

153
00:16:23,136 --> 00:16:28,296
And I ain't leaving them
for no drunk fellow to burn down.

154
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:32,417
Then I got nothing,
like when I'm fresh landed.

155
00:16:33,216 --> 00:16:35,337
Look out on that!

156
00:16:35,737 --> 00:16:38,816
That be a good farm some day.

157
00:16:39,216 --> 00:16:41,976
And I don't leave that
for no drunk fellow, no sir.

158
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,816
Billy! Get on with your mama.

159
00:16:45,216 --> 00:16:46,456
Go on. Go on!

160
00:16:46,857 --> 00:16:48,536
Gee, Pa, can't I stay?

161
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:52,697
Do like I tell you.

162
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:57,296
Get up! Go on, get up!
You take care of your mama, right?

163
00:16:57,697 --> 00:16:59,536
I wish you luck, Mr. Rukeyser.

164
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,296
Thank you.

165
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:06,616
You look to yourself, Willy!

166
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:09,096
I, er...

167
00:17:10,777 --> 00:17:14,937
I get to that door fixing,
so you don't curse them so much.

168
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:28,576
Hup! Hup! Get going there!

169
00:17:29,936 --> 00:17:33,897
Have a good trip now.
Say hello to the fellows at the Fort.

170
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:35,457
Here, Jeff!

171
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,337
Come on!

172
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:41,937
That's my boy.
That's my good boy.

173
00:17:49,137 --> 00:17:52,497
Wouldn't it have been simpler to pick
up the trail at the reservation?

174
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:56,217
There's all ways of
doing things, sir, I guess.

175
00:18:10,577 --> 00:18:13,057
They caught trail there, sir!

176
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,937
Stand by to dismount!

177
00:18:20,337 --> 00:18:22,417
Dismount!
- Dismount!

178
00:18:24,857 --> 00:18:27,617
It's them alright.
Moving steady, but not fast.

179
00:18:28,017 --> 00:18:31,498
How long ago? - Early this morning.
They're way up ahead.

180
00:18:31,898 --> 00:18:36,217
The only thing that slows them down
is how much killing they do.

181
00:18:37,297 --> 00:18:40,897
By their line of march,
which homesteads are likely to be hit?

182
00:18:41,297 --> 00:18:44,457
If they trail south, they'll kill
whatever crosses their path.

183
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,217
Otherwise where they please.

184
00:18:47,138 --> 00:18:50,018
Can we let them know
we're pressing them?

185
00:18:50,418 --> 00:18:53,298
They know we're coming.
There's no sense to hurrying.

186
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:58,378
Mr. Mclntosh, I think hurrying
is exactly what we should do.

187
00:19:01,577 --> 00:19:06,738
A horse will run so far, so fast,
for so long, and then he'll lie down.

188
00:19:07,138 --> 00:19:11,098
An Apache puts a fire under his belly
and gets him back up on his feet.

189
00:19:11,498 --> 00:19:16,578
When the horse dies, he gets off,
eats a bit of it and steals another.

190
00:19:19,218 --> 00:19:22,178
I just don't like
to think of people unprotected.

191
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:26,818
Yes, well it's best not to.

192
00:19:27,738 --> 00:19:29,338
Alright, Sergeant.

193
00:19:29,738 --> 00:19:33,258
Forward at a walk!

194
00:20:05,898 --> 00:20:07,258
Oh God!

195
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,738
Mama! Indians!

196
00:20:13,738 --> 00:20:15,258
Soldier!

197
00:20:16,898 --> 00:20:18,619
Don't leave me!

198
00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:21,659
Don't leave me!

199
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:26,138
Thank you.

200
00:20:26,898 --> 00:20:27,858
Thank you.

201
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:31,298
Get on!

202
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:35,619
Come on, boy, jump!

203
00:21:17,498 --> 00:21:18,899
Ma! No!

204
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,501
Hey Jeff!

205
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,900
Hey boy!

206
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,460
I'll get you, close up!

207
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:34,220
Alright you drunk fellows,
you come after me.

208
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:38,781
I teetotal you pretty damn quick.

209
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,340
You hear me?

210
00:24:49,381 --> 00:24:54,181
Ain't nice, cleaning up after Apaches.
- Why did they spare the boy?

211
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,020
Spare him what?
- Well, why didn't they kill him?

212
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:01,661
Just a whim, Lieutenant.

213
00:25:02,061 --> 00:25:04,621
Apaches got lots of whims.

214
00:25:12,421 --> 00:25:15,141
At least they didn't rape the woman.

215
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:17,821
She was already dead.

216
00:25:32,621 --> 00:25:34,341
Ke-Ni-Tay reckons
Horowitz shot the woman

217
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:37,541
and fled with the boy.
When they got his horse,

218
00:25:37,941 --> 00:25:39,621
he killed himself.

219
00:25:40,381 --> 00:25:41,701
Good man, that Horowitz.

220
00:25:43,821 --> 00:25:46,861
I'll have to send
a detail back with the boy.

221
00:25:48,821 --> 00:25:50,381
What is Ulzana planning?

222
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:54,181
He's going on. A few men
will be safe as 20 going back.

223
00:25:55,261 --> 00:25:56,261
A few men?

224
00:25:56,661 --> 00:26:02,101
If we run into Ulzana, Lieutenant,
we'll need all the men we got.

225
00:26:03,621 --> 00:26:07,341
Sergeant. - Sir.
- Send two men back with the wagon.

226
00:26:08,421 --> 00:26:11,981
You got anybody particular in mind?
- No, you pick them.

227
00:26:12,382 --> 00:26:14,341
Sir!
- Roberts,

228
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:17,862
Winfield, fall out!
Escort this wagon back to the Fort.

229
00:26:18,262 --> 00:26:22,102
Move them out, Sergeant.
- Troops! Prepare to mount!

230
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:24,261
Mount!

231
00:26:31,142 --> 00:26:33,502
Forward at a walk!

232
00:26:52,102 --> 00:26:53,222
No.

233
00:26:53,622 --> 00:26:57,702
They don't get in my house.
No drunk fellow getting me!

234
00:27:05,142 --> 00:27:09,622
You won't get this farm away from me.
No you don't!

235
00:27:13,822 --> 00:27:15,422
Nobody frightens Rukeyser.

236
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,022
Nobody!

237
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:30,942
No!

238
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,623
Alright, I'm ready for you!

239
00:27:50,022 --> 00:27:52,062
Come on!

240
00:27:56,623 --> 00:27:57,703
You hear me?

241
00:27:59,223 --> 00:28:02,062
Come on, show your face!

242
00:28:36,903 --> 00:28:37,983
God!

243
00:28:39,383 --> 00:28:40,503
God!

244
00:28:43,463 --> 00:28:45,943
You take all the praise

245
00:28:46,343 --> 00:28:48,063
and all the glory.

246
00:28:49,023 --> 00:28:53,183
You take all the praise
and all the glory.

247
00:29:26,743 --> 00:29:29,703
Halt! - Dismount them here.
- Prepare to dismount!

248
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:32,943
Dismount!

249
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:50,744
Is he in there?

250
00:29:53,943 --> 00:29:54,943
No.

251
00:29:55,743 --> 00:29:56,823
Mclntosh!

252
00:30:19,023 --> 00:30:20,983
Oh my God!

253
00:30:23,664 --> 00:30:26,544
Fire's about 2 hours,
maybe an hour and a half old.

254
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,344
They'd have watched him for a while.
They're close.

255
00:30:30,744 --> 00:30:34,024
What's that in his mouth?
- A dog's tail.

256
00:30:34,704 --> 00:30:37,344
Why?
- Apaches got a sense of humor.

257
00:30:38,824 --> 00:30:42,784
Nothing you'd recognize.
They just find some things funny.

258
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:59,824
Suit me,
if I never saw another Apache again.

259
00:31:07,303 --> 00:31:10,824
I was out after Nana in '81
with Lieutenant Gilpoil.

260
00:31:11,224 --> 00:31:12,824
I was a corporal then.

261
00:31:13,224 --> 00:31:16,864
We rode for 3 weeks. We never saw
one of those murdering bastards.

262
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:23,064
He's probably up
in them hills right now,

263
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:28,064
feeding on Rukseyer's dog
and thinking he's made a good start.

264
00:31:31,705 --> 00:31:35,104
Tomorrow we're going to ride.
- Right. Good night Mclntosh.

265
00:31:35,504 --> 00:31:37,584
Good night.
- Good night.

266
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:42,424
Post double pickets on the stock
and put pickets on perimeter guard.

267
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:47,344
Reveille at first light and prepare
to move out by half the hour.

268
00:31:51,985 --> 00:31:53,505
Ke-Ni-Tay...

269
00:31:53,905 --> 00:31:57,424
I want to ask you something.
- Alright, turn it off!

270
00:31:57,824 --> 00:32:00,304
Let's get some sleep.

271
00:32:04,264 --> 00:32:06,785
Why are your people like that?

272
00:32:09,584 --> 00:32:11,904
Why are they so cruel?

273
00:32:14,745 --> 00:32:15,825
Why?

274
00:32:17,105 --> 00:32:19,705
It's how they are.

275
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,705
But why?

276
00:32:22,904 --> 00:32:25,305
It's how they are.

277
00:32:25,705 --> 00:32:27,824
They have always been like that.

278
00:32:29,265 --> 00:32:30,864
Are you like that?

279
00:32:32,385 --> 00:32:34,824
Would you kill a man like that?

280
00:32:36,505 --> 00:32:37,465
Yes.

281
00:32:38,104 --> 00:32:39,105
Why?

282
00:32:40,984 --> 00:32:43,665
To take the power.

283
00:32:45,265 --> 00:32:47,505
Each man that die,

284
00:32:48,585 --> 00:32:50,505
the man that kill him,

285
00:32:50,905 --> 00:32:52,905
take his power.

286
00:32:54,785 --> 00:32:57,825
Man give up his power
when he dies.

287
00:33:00,665 --> 00:33:03,345
Like fire give heat.

288
00:33:05,345 --> 00:33:08,145
Fire that burn a long time,

289
00:33:09,145 --> 00:33:10,785
many can have heat.

290
00:33:11,385 --> 00:33:15,585
You mean,
you torture a man for hours,

291
00:33:17,185 --> 00:33:21,505
and you get power from watching
some poor creature suffering?

292
00:33:23,065 --> 00:33:25,505
What kind of power is that?

293
00:33:26,825 --> 00:33:29,145
Here in this land

294
00:33:29,545 --> 00:33:31,905
man must have power.

295
00:33:35,105 --> 00:33:36,985
You not know about power.

296
00:33:38,065 --> 00:33:39,905
I want to know.

297
00:33:40,505 --> 00:33:41,905
I want to understand.

298
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:49,585
Ulzana is a long time in the agency.

299
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:54,025
His power very thin.

300
00:33:56,506 --> 00:34:00,626
Smells in his nose
are old smell of the agency.

301
00:34:01,026 --> 00:34:02,505
Old smell.

302
00:34:03,786 --> 00:34:05,905
Smell of woman,

303
00:34:06,305 --> 00:34:08,466
smell of dog,

304
00:34:08,866 --> 00:34:10,985
smell of children,

305
00:34:13,946 --> 00:34:16,986
man with old smell in his nose,

306
00:34:17,386 --> 00:34:19,546
is an old man.

307
00:34:21,105 --> 00:34:23,906
Ulzana came for new smell.

308
00:34:24,786 --> 00:34:26,546
Pony running,

309
00:34:26,946 --> 00:34:28,586
the smell of burning,

310
00:34:28,986 --> 00:34:32,706
the smell of bullet for power.

311
00:34:35,505 --> 00:34:38,706
Soldier pack with a wagon, no power.

312
00:34:40,386 --> 00:34:43,465
Woman, no power. No pleasure.

313
00:34:45,906 --> 00:34:47,746
Why didn't they kill the boy?

314
00:34:52,746 --> 00:34:55,586
Man cannot take power from boy.

315
00:34:56,466 --> 00:34:57,666
Only from man.

316
00:35:03,746 --> 00:35:05,706
Then Ulzana will want to kill many.

317
00:35:08,786 --> 00:35:10,666
Many.

318
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,507
Do you hate Apaches, Mr. Mclntosh?

319
00:36:01,227 --> 00:36:02,226
No.

320
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,227
Well, I do.

321
00:36:07,586 --> 00:36:10,907
Well, it might not make
you happy, Lieutenant,

322
00:36:11,907 --> 00:36:16,667
but it sure won't make you lonesome.
Most white folks here feel the same.

323
00:36:18,227 --> 00:36:19,827
Why don't you feel that way?

324
00:36:21,907 --> 00:36:24,826
Lt'd be like hating the desert
because there ain't no water on it.

325
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:28,067
It's enough
that I'm just plenty scared of them.

326
00:37:22,587 --> 00:37:24,147
Troops, halt!

327
00:37:34,187 --> 00:37:36,067
Ever eat dog, Lieutenant?

328
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:40,108
No, can't say I have.
- Tasty enough if you get it young.

329
00:37:42,347 --> 00:37:45,787
Where do you think they're headed?
- Ke-Ni-Tay?

330
00:37:46,907 --> 00:37:49,028
They'll go where it's hard to follow.

331
00:37:49,428 --> 00:37:52,588
Where will they fight us?
- He don't mean to fight you nowhere.

332
00:37:54,307 --> 00:37:55,907
He only means to kill you.

333
00:38:02,428 --> 00:38:03,747
You know Ulzana?

334
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:07,747
His wife my wife's sister.

335
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:09,947
Sisters?

336
00:38:12,227 --> 00:38:13,907
His wife ugly.

337
00:38:16,148 --> 00:38:17,627
My wife not so ugly.

338
00:39:09,228 --> 00:39:11,388
Detail, halt!

339
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,428
Damn him!

340
00:39:13,828 --> 00:39:16,108
What's he up to, Ke-Ni-Tay?

341
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:20,508
Ulzana wants to make you run now.

342
00:39:21,148 --> 00:39:23,068
He wants us to kill some horses.

343
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:26,508
You know how soldiers walk?

344
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:31,229
Apache walk better than soldiers.

345
00:39:32,228 --> 00:39:34,668
Troops, at a walk!

346
00:39:44,588 --> 00:39:47,908
Going to be like this
all the way, Sergeant?

347
00:41:47,469 --> 00:41:49,429
Halt, troops! Halt!

348
00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:59,310
How long?
- Sunrise or a little later.

349
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:06,509
Lieutenant, a horse apple dries out
at a certain rate.

350
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,830
This one's pretty solid.

351
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:12,630
Ke-Ni-Tay figures on four,
maybe five hours. - What do you think?

352
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:18,709
I ain't about to argue with no Apache
about horseshit. He's the expert.

353
00:42:21,469 --> 00:42:25,510
Well, we're not gaining on him.
- Only way to gain is push

354
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,950
the horses till they get the staggers,
then catch up on foot.

355
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:31,349
Ulzana would like that just fine!

356
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:34,909
I sure don't want to be on foot
around any horse-backing Apaches!

357
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:38,869
Well, what's the point, Mr. Mclntosh,
if we can't close the gap?

358
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,029
Remember the rules, Lieutenant.

359
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:44,870
First one to make
a mistake gets to burying some people.

360
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:54,310
How long are you out from the East?
- East?

361
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:57,710
The academy.
- Oh, about six months.

362
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:01,670
Well, they'd sure all be proud
if they could see you now.

363
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:17,310
Alright, Sergeant. Bring them on.
- At a walk!

364
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,631
Halt!

365
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,471
What's wrong?

366
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:48,310
We got a problem, Lieutenant.
- What sort of a problem?

367
00:43:49,231 --> 00:43:52,351
Well, Ke-Ni-Tay thinks
the horses are running without riders,

368
00:43:52,751 --> 00:43:55,631
except for two.
A lead horse and an end horse.

369
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:04,350
You mean they're behind us?
- That's right. A way back.

370
00:44:06,631 --> 00:44:07,711
Is he sure?

371
00:44:10,351 --> 00:44:13,631
He's pretty sure.
Signs show ponies running light.

372
00:44:14,711 --> 00:44:18,911
I suppose he'll try an ambush.
- No, I don't think so, Lieutenant.

373
00:44:20,191 --> 00:44:22,831
He wants to get us into the hills.

374
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:26,591
Make us keep coming
while he circles round behind.

375
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:31,951
His ponies are going to be
a lot fresher than ours.

376
00:44:32,351 --> 00:44:35,551
And if we go chasing them, there's
a good chance of becoming infantry.

377
00:44:36,711 --> 00:44:37,991
But if we don't,

378
00:44:39,351 --> 00:44:42,751
he gets ahead of us.
Either way, he's smiling.

379
00:44:44,911 --> 00:44:48,711
Sounds like he has us.
- Well, like I said, Lieutenant,

380
00:44:49,711 --> 00:44:52,551
first one to make a mistake
gets to digging in the ground.

381
00:44:53,951 --> 00:44:56,711
What he's up to is pretty bright.

382
00:45:01,111 --> 00:45:03,871
Just might be we can outfox him.
- How?

383
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:08,151
By getting to his horses
before he does.

384
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,912
That's us.

385
00:45:29,231 --> 00:45:30,471
That's their horses.

386
00:45:31,631 --> 00:45:35,271
Somewhere along that line,
they'll double back to pick up Ulzana.

387
00:45:35,672 --> 00:45:37,432
Ulzana's here.

388
00:45:37,832 --> 00:45:39,311
Question is,

389
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,991
did he drop off to the right,
or to the left?

390
00:45:45,311 --> 00:45:46,951
The other question is,

391
00:45:47,832 --> 00:45:51,432
how wide a circle are
those ponies making to the right,

392
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,752
or to the left,

393
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:58,272
on their way back to Ulzana.
- Can you pick up

394
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,911
their trail in the night?
- In broken country, no,

395
00:46:02,311 --> 00:46:04,511
but with 9 ponies running straight,

396
00:46:04,911 --> 00:46:06,551
it should be possible,
if the moon is up.

397
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,232
How shall we divide the troops?

398
00:46:15,552 --> 00:46:19,431
Send me and a galloper that way and
Ke-Ti-Nay and a galloper this way.

399
00:46:20,271 --> 00:46:24,511
Either one of us cut trail, we'll send
the galloper to pick you up.

400
00:46:24,912 --> 00:46:28,752
Alright, you'd better get started.
Who do you want for gallopers?

401
00:46:29,152 --> 00:46:31,832
No preference,
so long as they don't talk too much.

402
00:46:52,912 --> 00:46:56,232
Pickets checked and at their posts.
- Good, Sergeant.

403
00:46:56,632 --> 00:46:59,632
You impressed upon them
the need for constant alert?

404
00:47:00,032 --> 00:47:05,233
I wouldn't figure that's necessary.
I reckon Rukeyser did that good.

405
00:47:08,793 --> 00:47:12,392
That the Bible you're reading, sir?
- Yes.

406
00:47:13,832 --> 00:47:17,112
A gift from my father
on my last trip home.

407
00:47:17,512 --> 00:47:20,713
My father's a minister.
- So I heard tell, sir.

408
00:47:23,313 --> 00:47:25,752
I wish I could ask him
about the Apache.

409
00:47:26,952 --> 00:47:28,032
What, sir?

410
00:47:32,152 --> 00:47:35,113
Why do they do these terrible things?

411
00:47:35,913 --> 00:47:37,552
I mean,

412
00:47:38,512 --> 00:47:43,593
after all, they are men
made in God's image like ourselves.

413
00:47:45,872 --> 00:47:51,632
It seems to me that an eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth is the part

414
00:47:52,032 --> 00:47:54,273
that matters to the Apache.

415
00:47:54,672 --> 00:47:59,673
And that's the way to treat them.
- Well, Christ taught us another way.

416
00:48:02,032 --> 00:48:04,073
Yes, he did, sir.

417
00:48:07,473 --> 00:48:11,112
But Christ never fetched no
infant child out of a cactus tree

418
00:48:11,512 --> 00:48:15,593
and then waited for two hours
until it died to bury it, did he?

419
00:48:17,552 --> 00:48:19,753
No.
- I did.

420
00:48:26,433 --> 00:48:31,153
Ain't nobody going to tell me to turn
the other cheek to no Apache, sir.

421
00:49:14,073 --> 00:49:16,233
They crossed behind us.

422
00:49:16,634 --> 00:49:19,393
You ride for the lieutenant,
bring him back to pick up the trail.

423
00:49:19,993 --> 00:49:22,833
Tell him to come awful quick
and follow it all the way.

424
00:51:54,834 --> 00:51:57,515
Right turn!

425
00:52:07,755 --> 00:52:10,314
Morning, Lieutenant.
Glad you got here.

426
00:52:10,714 --> 00:52:13,194
What happened?
- I caught up with their ponies.

427
00:52:14,515 --> 00:52:17,235
How many were there?
- About 9. - Hostiles, I mean.

428
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:18,715
Two.

429
00:52:19,115 --> 00:52:22,715
There's one of them, dead.
Other one's hit, though.

430
00:52:23,115 --> 00:52:26,754
He laid up for a while
beyond that rise and then moved on.

431
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:29,515
Sergeant!
Check for signs behind that rise.

432
00:52:30,075 --> 00:52:32,915
Hayle. Buckley. Follow me.

433
00:52:33,315 --> 00:52:36,395
Troops! Prepare to dismount!

434
00:52:36,795 --> 00:52:38,435
Dismount!

435
00:52:41,675 --> 00:52:45,676
So they're on foot? - It's a good way
to describe men without horses.

436
00:52:48,275 --> 00:52:50,515
We should pursue them immediately.

437
00:52:50,915 --> 00:52:55,715
Ulzana's going to be tough to spot.
We'd better wait for Ke-Ni-Tay.

438
00:52:59,715 --> 00:53:03,315
I thought you could follow
a trail as well as any Apache.

439
00:53:03,715 --> 00:53:05,995
Well, you thought wrong, Lieutenant.

440
00:53:07,915 --> 00:53:10,356
Mr. Mclntosh, I want to press on.

441
00:53:11,915 --> 00:53:15,315
You're the one who gives the orders.
Just saying my say.

442
00:53:16,116 --> 00:53:17,356
He was there, sir.

443
00:53:18,755 --> 00:53:21,436
He's gone now. You hit him, alright.

444
00:53:22,956 --> 00:53:25,716
Can you follow the trail, Sergeant?

445
00:53:27,835 --> 00:53:30,275
I figure I could, sir,
unless he runs out of blood.

446
00:53:31,316 --> 00:53:33,956
Okay, take one man and go after him.
We'll catch up with you.

447
00:53:40,956 --> 00:53:43,116
Lieutenant! Ain't worth the trouble.

448
00:53:44,476 --> 00:53:49,235
No chance of him getting to Ulzana.
He'll crawl away and die someplace.

449
00:53:50,356 --> 00:53:52,676
He may not die.

450
00:53:53,076 --> 00:53:56,676
I recall you saying that
Apache war parties come in all sizes,

451
00:53:57,076 --> 00:54:00,156
some with 100 warriors, some with 1.
- So I did.

452
00:54:00,556 --> 00:54:05,956
Since we have to wait for Ke-Ni-Tay,
I suggest we use the time well.

453
00:54:06,355 --> 00:54:07,356
Sergeant!

454
00:54:07,756 --> 00:54:08,955
Yes, sir.

455
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:15,876
Miller!

456
00:54:16,276 --> 00:54:19,556
Yes, Sergeant!
- Fall out. You're with me.

457
00:54:19,996 --> 00:54:23,276
Corporal! Post sentries.
- Yes, sir.

458
00:54:24,076 --> 00:54:25,796
Sentries, out!

459
00:55:14,796 --> 00:55:16,677
Now! Come on!
- Cut him!

460
00:55:17,077 --> 00:55:19,957
Cut him!
- That's the way!

461
00:55:21,516 --> 00:55:22,997
Cut it out!

462
00:55:23,397 --> 00:55:24,956
Cut it clean out!

463
00:55:25,356 --> 00:55:27,156
Dirty Apache dog!

464
00:55:28,197 --> 00:55:29,437
What's going on?

465
00:55:30,436 --> 00:55:33,517
He's got a trooper's side-gun, sir.
- It's Ulzana's son.

466
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:36,037
They cut up Horowitz pretty bad.

467
00:55:37,117 --> 00:55:39,677
It spooks the Apaches
when they do this to their dead.

468
00:55:40,077 --> 00:55:43,876
I want that boy buried,
you understand?

469
00:55:44,276 --> 00:55:46,317
Bury him!

470
00:56:25,397 --> 00:56:27,477
What's wrong, Lieutenant?

471
00:56:29,517 --> 00:56:31,517
Is that Ulzana's son?

472
00:56:32,997 --> 00:56:36,037
So I believe.
- So you believe.

473
00:56:38,157 --> 00:56:41,237
Why wasn't I told
that Ulzana's son was one of them?

474
00:56:43,117 --> 00:56:45,637
Would it have made a difference
if you'd known?

475
00:56:46,037 --> 00:56:49,877
It might have made me feel
I was the officer in command.

476
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:57,957
That's fair enough, Lieutenant.
I was wrong not to mention it.

477
00:56:58,357 --> 00:57:03,238
Well, killing I expect, Mr. Mclntosh,
but mutilation and torture,

478
00:57:03,637 --> 00:57:07,238
I cannot accept that as readily as
you seem to be able to.

479
00:57:07,638 --> 00:57:10,757
What bothers you, Lieutenant,

480
00:57:11,157 --> 00:57:14,717
is you don't like to think
of white men behaving like Indians.

481
00:57:15,117 --> 00:57:18,117
Kind of confuses the issue, don't it?

482
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:24,918
Rider coming in.

483
00:57:28,797 --> 00:57:32,637
Ke-Ni-Tay and the galloper.
All we need is your hunting party.

484
00:57:33,038 --> 00:57:35,038
We'll be on our ways.

485
00:57:48,957 --> 00:57:53,477
Ke-Ni-Tay thinks Ulzana will head
for water and then try to find horses.

486
00:57:53,878 --> 00:57:57,238
I might have made
those deductions myself.

487
00:57:57,918 --> 00:58:03,278
We're a horse short, Lieutenant.
- Ke-Ni-Tay will give you his.

488
00:58:03,678 --> 00:58:07,918
Apaches walk better
than soldiers, remember?

489
00:58:10,357 --> 00:58:14,278
Corporal, take care of
Mr. Mclntosh's gear. - Yes, sir!

490
00:58:14,678 --> 00:58:18,198
To the left! Forward walk!

491
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:27,878
I've got your horse.

492
00:59:21,718 --> 00:59:24,158
Rider coming in, sir.

493
00:59:25,558 --> 00:59:26,879
It's Sergeant Burns.

494
00:59:27,279 --> 00:59:28,919
Detail halt!

495
00:59:35,678 --> 00:59:38,278
Report, Sergeant.

496
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:41,519
Trooper Miller is dead from wounds,

497
00:59:43,078 --> 00:59:44,079
sir.

498
00:59:45,438 --> 00:59:46,518
And the hostile?

499
00:59:49,759 --> 00:59:50,758
Dead,

500
00:59:53,079 --> 00:59:54,079
sir.

501
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:01,399
I want a full report at next camp.
- There ain't a whole lot more, sir.

502
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:05,239
Not unless you want to know
how Miller felt about dying.

503
01:00:10,279 --> 01:00:12,559
Bring them on, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

504
01:00:12,959 --> 01:00:15,159
Forward at a walk!

505
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:39,319
We had a trail, Lieutenant,
but it's gone.

506
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,159
Or nigh impossible
to follow on these rocks.

507
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,399
I want to catch up with him.

508
01:00:45,399 --> 01:00:49,079
Horses are almost broken down.
They need rest and feed.

509
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:51,199
Ulzana needs horses.

510
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:56,119
There's hardly a dozen around here.
- Are you telling me we're winning?

511
01:00:56,399 --> 01:01:01,080
I'm trying to tell you,
Ulzana can't lead a war party on foot.

512
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,919
He has to steal...
- More horses, I know.

513
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,439
Sergeant! Where's the next homestead?

514
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:11,839
The Riordans', sir. It's about
5 miles along those foothills.

515
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:13,479
They got good water.

516
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:14,920
Any horses?

517
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:18,520
They might have 1 or 2,
I don't know for sure.

518
01:01:20,759 --> 01:01:25,640
Can this man be trusted to pick up
the trail if we leave him behind?

519
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,279
I trust him.

520
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:39,520
Right, we'll make for the homestead.
He can meet us there.

521
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,480
Sweet Jesus!

522
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,400
Leave that body where it is!
- It needs burying.

523
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:29,441
I want the Apache scout to do that.
- Damn it, you're not making sense!

524
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,561
Now look, Mr. Mclntosh. That used
to be a white man, like yourself.

525
01:02:33,961 --> 01:02:37,401
A white man! I think
you're not making any sense.

526
01:02:41,081 --> 01:02:42,640
Mr. Mclntosh!

527
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:50,760
Get me the blanket!
- Coming up.

528
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,320
Get that medical kit over here.
- Cut her loose, she's not dead.

529
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,321
Easy with her.

530
01:03:13,601 --> 01:03:16,120
How is she?
- About the same.

531
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,921
Are Apaches just as cruel
to their own women?

532
01:03:25,921 --> 01:03:27,401
Ain't much of a life.

533
01:03:31,721 --> 01:03:33,920
You live
with an Indian woman, don't you?

534
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,321
That's right.

535
01:03:37,801 --> 01:03:39,160
Why?

536
01:03:41,801 --> 01:03:44,201
That's the goddamndest question!

537
01:03:48,921 --> 01:03:52,881
I understand your sympathy for them.
- Sympathy?

538
01:03:54,721 --> 01:03:56,481
Living with the woman.

539
01:04:04,361 --> 01:04:07,961
You'd be well-advised
to stop hating and start thinking.

540
01:04:08,361 --> 01:04:11,521
You ain't doing too well up till now.

541
01:04:13,361 --> 01:04:16,521
Ke-Ni-Tay,
I want to speak with you.

542
01:04:39,521 --> 01:04:42,401
What is Ulzana going to do now?

543
01:04:44,441 --> 01:04:47,122
Ulzana think of his son now.

544
01:04:47,521 --> 01:04:50,481
In him, there is only to kill

545
01:04:51,242 --> 01:04:53,681
and the place where his son was.

546
01:04:54,921 --> 01:04:58,001
It takes many dead
to fill that place.

547
01:04:58,922 --> 01:05:00,121
What are his plans?

548
01:05:01,922 --> 01:05:06,042
Ulzana take two horses from here.
He need more.

549
01:05:06,442 --> 01:05:10,162
If he not get them,
his men go back to the agency.

550
01:05:10,562 --> 01:05:12,522
Apache not soldier.

551
01:05:12,922 --> 01:05:15,522
Apache not sign paper to fight.

552
01:05:15,922 --> 01:05:18,162
Only fight when it's good.

553
01:05:19,401 --> 01:05:21,442
Are you telling me,
that the raid's over?

554
01:05:22,922 --> 01:05:27,602
Ulzana must given
good power, many horse,

555
01:05:28,442 --> 01:05:31,081
or the raid is finished.

556
01:05:31,682 --> 01:05:35,442
How does he plan to get
this power and these horses?

557
01:05:36,882 --> 01:05:38,522
From you.

558
01:05:38,922 --> 01:05:43,961
He mean to kill you
and take all your horse.

559
01:05:45,362 --> 01:05:49,682
How? Attack us in force?
- What will you do about Mrs. Riordan?

560
01:05:51,042 --> 01:05:56,122
She'll be escorted back to the Fort.
- How many men are you going to send?

561
01:05:57,121 --> 01:05:58,402
Six, with Sergeant Burns.

562
01:06:00,522 --> 01:06:04,162
You'll split your force.
- Well, I have no alternative.

563
01:06:05,682 --> 01:06:07,082
You don't?

564
01:06:08,282 --> 01:06:10,362
What do you mean? Mrs. Riordan...

565
01:06:10,762 --> 01:06:12,682
has to go back to Fort Lowell.

566
01:06:13,082 --> 01:06:17,762
Apaches normally rape
women prisoners to death.

567
01:06:18,162 --> 01:06:21,882
Why did they spare Mrs. Riordan?
- Maybe they thought she was dead.

568
01:06:23,122 --> 01:06:25,363
Ulzana leave woman for you to find.

569
01:06:25,762 --> 01:06:29,682
He know you send her back.
He attack the soldier you send.

570
01:06:30,482 --> 01:06:34,602
The problem with fighting the Apaches
is predicting what they'll do next.

571
01:06:35,002 --> 01:06:36,842
When you know that, you've a chance.

572
01:06:37,963 --> 01:06:41,003
We force Ulzana to attack
and then we counter-attack.

573
01:06:41,762 --> 01:06:44,522
So we strengthen the detail.
- Or weaken it.

574
01:06:44,922 --> 01:06:48,523
You've got to give them the odds
if you want to coax them out.

575
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:51,683
I see that.

576
01:06:52,682 --> 01:06:57,283
It'll be very dangerous
for the escort and Mrs. Riordan.

577
01:06:57,682 --> 01:07:02,002
And Mrs. Riordan. It's fish
or cut bait. But you'd be wise

578
01:07:02,403 --> 01:07:04,802
to listen to what Ke-Ni-Tay said.

579
01:07:05,202 --> 01:07:07,603
Ulzana's bucks will be tired
from roaming in them mountains,

580
01:07:08,042 --> 01:07:12,602
with nothing to eat but berries.
Pretty soon they'll be thinking of

581
01:07:13,002 --> 01:07:14,963
agency beef
and laying up with their wives.

582
01:07:15,762 --> 01:07:19,083
Mrs. Riordan!
- I want to wash.

583
01:07:19,483 --> 01:07:20,923
I have to wash it off!

584
01:07:22,722 --> 01:07:27,843
Mrs. Riordan! - I want to wash.
Please, I want to wash.

585
01:07:34,003 --> 01:07:36,243
I have to wash it off!

586
01:07:39,042 --> 01:07:40,923
It won't come off.

587
01:07:43,923 --> 01:07:46,363
It won't come off.

588
01:08:05,043 --> 01:08:06,043
God damn!

589
01:08:11,363 --> 01:08:15,003
Let me be! Let me be!

590
01:08:17,723 --> 01:08:19,403
Damned Indians.

591
01:08:19,803 --> 01:08:22,764
Peter wanted to die.

592
01:08:23,523 --> 01:08:26,803
Oh God. How he wanted to die.

593
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:29,883
I can assure you, Mrs. Riordan,
that everything will be done...

594
01:08:34,083 --> 01:08:37,883
Why do they do that? - Hell, they
don't treat their women much better.

595
01:08:38,483 --> 01:08:41,523
Alright, if you need anything,
just call. Somebody will hear you.

596
01:08:41,923 --> 01:08:45,964
Lad, if they come back,

597
01:08:46,963 --> 01:08:50,283
promise me
you won't let them take me?

598
01:08:50,683 --> 01:08:53,204
I don't want you to worry.
- Promise me.

599
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:58,043
Promise me!
- I promise.

600
01:09:02,244 --> 01:09:03,764
Thank you.

601
01:09:19,723 --> 01:09:22,043
That poor woman's almost crazy.

602
01:09:24,484 --> 01:09:26,964
Imagine watching
her husband die like that?

603
01:09:27,844 --> 01:09:31,564
I hate to expose her
to further danger tomorrow.

604
01:09:33,163 --> 01:09:37,124
I suppose there's no other way.
- Not if you want Ulzana.

605
01:09:38,204 --> 01:09:40,563
I do, Mr. Mclntosh.

606
01:09:41,724 --> 01:09:43,284
I want him!

607
01:10:04,604 --> 01:10:09,124
You'll be safe with this escort,
Mrs. Riordan. It's a good road back.

608
01:10:09,524 --> 01:10:13,924
I hope to meet you in Fort Lowell
under happier circumstances.

609
01:10:15,764 --> 01:10:18,524
Sergeant, take them on.

610
01:10:24,004 --> 01:10:27,924
You'll have to make it look good.
Ulzana will watch to make sure

611
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:31,524
you take his bait,
before he takes ours.

612
01:10:32,125 --> 01:10:33,325
I understand.

613
01:10:35,324 --> 01:10:38,084
Good luck.
- And to you.

614
01:11:24,804 --> 01:11:25,845
Come right.

615
01:11:26,245 --> 01:11:27,765
Halt!

616
01:12:17,726 --> 01:12:19,325
Detail halt!

617
01:12:20,845 --> 01:12:22,325
Dismount!

618
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:35,126
I thought you're going
to let them pull us out?

619
01:12:35,525 --> 01:12:40,525
If we follow them all the way,
it'd be too far to help Mr. Mclntosh.

620
01:12:40,926 --> 01:12:44,726
If we turn back too soon,
it'd warn them and won't attack.

621
01:12:45,126 --> 01:12:46,646
The right time is crucial.

622
01:12:49,205 --> 01:12:50,965
Apache's calling you up, sir.

623
01:12:58,405 --> 01:13:02,286
What is it?
- Ulzana want to take you up there.

624
01:13:03,206 --> 01:13:06,165
Mountain of fire. His mind is clear.

625
01:13:06,926 --> 01:13:08,966
Then we must go.
- No!

626
01:13:09,365 --> 01:13:11,525
Where he takes you, you can't go.

627
01:13:11,926 --> 01:13:16,166
If you will go,
you not ride back to help Mclntosh.

628
01:13:16,966 --> 01:13:22,206
Yes, but it's too early to ride back
and they're watching what we do.

629
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:25,406
Isn't that so? How many are watching?

630
01:13:26,406 --> 01:13:28,286
One man see as many as ten.

631
01:13:29,526 --> 01:13:33,006
Can we find him and kill him?
- You cannot.

632
01:13:33,406 --> 01:13:35,966
But Ke-Ni-Tay can?

633
01:13:36,726 --> 01:13:38,646
But will he?

634
01:13:39,046 --> 01:13:42,925
Ke-Ni-Tay sign paper.
Ke-Ni-Tay soldier.

635
01:13:44,845 --> 01:13:48,166
Alright, find him and kill him.

636
01:13:50,006 --> 01:13:51,646
Give me your long glass.

637
01:14:00,846 --> 01:14:03,526
When you see it make a light,

638
01:14:04,727 --> 01:14:05,926
like this,

639
01:14:07,126 --> 01:14:10,846
then you must ride back to Mclntosh.
- Alright.

640
01:14:16,806 --> 01:14:18,886
Corporal, call the men out.

641
01:14:19,286 --> 01:14:20,606
Yes, sir.

642
01:14:54,367 --> 01:14:57,607
We're going through Dog Canyon, right?
- That's right.

643
01:14:58,006 --> 01:15:00,927
You're expecting them to jump us?
- Could happen.

644
01:15:01,327 --> 01:15:04,446
You're not fooling me, Mclntosh.
It's supposed to happen.

645
01:15:04,846 --> 01:15:09,646
And then Lieutenant DeBuin's supposed
to just ride up and save us, right?

646
01:15:10,046 --> 01:15:12,127
Something like that.

647
01:15:12,526 --> 01:15:14,327
Hm. "Something like that."

648
01:15:15,847 --> 01:15:20,647
You're putting a lot of trust
in a man with no idea.

649
01:15:21,047 --> 01:15:23,087
How do you figure they'll hit us?

650
01:15:23,486 --> 01:15:27,046
Well, it don't seem likely.
These horses they're after,

651
01:15:27,446 --> 01:15:32,127
you keep them tucked away.
If the worst comes to it, shoot them.

652
01:15:34,327 --> 01:15:36,127
Shoot them?
- Shoot them.

653
01:15:36,527 --> 01:15:39,327
The army don't like
sergeants shooting their horses.

654
01:15:39,727 --> 01:15:44,807
Maybe so, but they'd like it less
if 7 Apaches ride them off.

655
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:47,207
Right, I'll pass the word.

656
01:15:47,607 --> 01:15:51,567
Not so it bothers her.
- Right.

657
01:15:51,967 --> 01:15:54,048
Wagon out.

658
01:15:57,287 --> 01:15:59,007
Keep your eyes open.

659
01:16:05,407 --> 01:16:08,007
How long do you figure he'll take?

660
01:16:09,007 --> 01:16:10,607
I don't know.

661
01:16:11,007 --> 01:16:16,727
Should we trust that Apache, sir?
- I don't think we have much choice.

662
01:16:28,367 --> 01:16:30,887
There! Halfway up the cliff!

663
01:16:31,287 --> 01:16:33,248
See it?
- That's it. Found him!

664
01:16:33,648 --> 01:16:36,047
Let's go, come on.

665
01:16:36,447 --> 01:16:37,768
Let's move.

666
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:47,967
Come on.

667
01:18:11,808 --> 01:18:14,889
Can we go through fast?
- Let's set a while.

668
01:18:15,288 --> 01:18:17,769
Set a while? - Got to give Ke-Ni-Tay
time to flush the lookout.

669
01:18:19,689 --> 01:18:20,848
Dismount!

670
01:18:22,688 --> 01:18:25,248
Rest your horses!

671
01:20:46,929 --> 01:20:48,009
God damn!

672
01:20:55,610 --> 01:20:57,450
Get those horses!

673
01:21:01,609 --> 01:21:05,090
The horses. Don't let them get away!
- Come on.

674
01:21:06,730 --> 01:21:08,169
They're on both sides.

675
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:21,329
Let's get the hell out of here! - No!
Get off your horses and walk them.

676
01:21:21,730 --> 01:21:23,930
Use them as a shield.

677
01:21:24,610 --> 01:21:27,170
Stay behind your horses!

678
01:22:00,490 --> 01:22:04,890
Don't break off!
Stay down! Stay together!

679
01:22:28,811 --> 01:22:30,610
The wagon. Get the wagon.

680
01:22:34,251 --> 01:22:37,931
Into the rocks! Under the damn rocks!

681
01:23:35,691 --> 01:23:38,611
Help me, Sergeant! I'm hurt bad.

682
01:23:39,011 --> 01:23:41,691
Help me!
- Come on, grab a hold.

683
01:23:48,772 --> 01:23:49,811
Come on.

684
01:24:08,051 --> 01:24:09,052
Mclntosh!

685
01:24:10,051 --> 01:24:11,451
I'm coming in.

686
01:24:27,172 --> 01:24:31,851
He's hit. Would you look after him?
- It ain't so bad. Don't bother her.

687
01:24:42,092 --> 01:24:47,132
Somebody shoot me, please!
Somebody shoot me up.

688
01:24:47,612 --> 01:24:53,172
In the name of sweet Jesus!
Somebody shoot me off!

689
01:24:59,732 --> 01:25:01,532
Where the hell is that lieutenant?

690
01:25:04,412 --> 01:25:06,652
What do we do now?

691
01:25:19,572 --> 01:25:21,732
Forward at a gallop.

692
01:25:35,492 --> 01:25:39,452
You alright? - Oh sweet mother Mary.
- What day is it?

693
01:25:39,852 --> 01:25:40,852
What?

694
01:25:44,012 --> 01:25:45,452
What day is it?

695
01:25:46,212 --> 01:25:47,332
Wednesday.

696
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:53,132
Sure don't look like Wednesday.

697
01:26:15,052 --> 01:26:16,292
Wednesday...

698
01:28:22,733 --> 01:28:27,653
The wagon, sir. Somebody's moving.
- What? - By the wagon.

699
01:28:29,693 --> 01:28:31,814
Prepare to dismount!

700
01:28:32,214 --> 01:28:33,293
Dismount!

701
01:28:37,294 --> 01:28:40,454
Frederickson, look after Mrs. Riordan.
- Jack, take care of the horses.

702
01:28:40,854 --> 01:28:42,934
I'll help you ma'am.
- Smithers. Johnson. Lend a hand.

703
01:28:43,334 --> 01:28:44,774
We came as fast as we could.

704
01:28:45,174 --> 01:28:48,734
Ulzana ran out
as soon as he heard your music.

705
01:28:50,133 --> 01:28:53,454
We wanted you to know we were coming.
- The trick was

706
01:28:53,853 --> 01:28:55,734
not to let Ulzana know.

707
01:29:00,734 --> 01:29:02,454
Careful with him.

708
01:29:09,734 --> 01:29:11,654
Set him easy.

709
01:29:15,534 --> 01:29:20,054
Alright, bring some bed tarps here
and make a shelter.

710
01:29:20,454 --> 01:29:22,614
Move that wagon out.

711
01:29:31,014 --> 01:29:33,134
All these men!

712
01:29:36,934 --> 01:29:38,134
If only I'd...

713
01:29:38,535 --> 01:29:42,974
Don't start iffing, man.
You made your pick. Live with it.

714
01:29:46,734 --> 01:29:48,854
Hell, Lieutenant,

715
01:29:49,734 --> 01:29:51,254
there ain't none of us right.

716
01:29:57,654 --> 01:30:02,214
Wouldn't say no to a smoke though.
- I've got the makings. - Good Boy.

717
01:30:08,255 --> 01:30:12,535
Corporal, get those Apaches buried.
- Buried, sir?

718
01:30:13,814 --> 01:30:16,014
Bury them.
- Yes, sir?

719
01:30:18,214 --> 01:30:22,135
Graves detail.
- Don't suppose making cigarettes

720
01:30:23,935 --> 01:30:27,335
is one of
your accomplishments, Lieutenant?

721
01:30:27,735 --> 01:30:29,815
No, sorry.

722
01:30:31,855 --> 01:30:33,775
Never mind.

723
01:30:35,375 --> 01:30:36,895
You'll learn.

724
01:33:20,536 --> 01:33:22,056
That'll be Ke-Ni-Tay.

725
01:33:23,656 --> 01:33:26,856
It's time
we were getting you on the wagon.

726
01:33:27,256 --> 01:33:29,056
Only cause me a lot of suffering.

727
01:33:30,376 --> 01:33:32,257
Well, you can't stay here.

728
01:33:32,657 --> 01:33:36,456
It'd be two days
before we got back. You'd die.

729
01:33:37,737 --> 01:33:40,296
Hell, Lieutenant,
I'm going to die anyway.

730
01:33:41,177 --> 01:33:45,456
Not if we get you to the surgeon.
- You won't get me to the surgeon.

731
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:47,897
You might not get me to that wagon.

732
01:33:50,736 --> 01:33:51,896
What about your...

733
01:33:52,456 --> 01:33:53,937
My burial?

734
01:33:55,456 --> 01:33:58,857
Being another one of those
black markers back at the Fort

735
01:33:59,257 --> 01:34:00,856
don't have much appeal for me.

736
01:34:03,217 --> 01:34:05,857
I'll leave a detail behind.
- The hell you will.

737
01:34:07,337 --> 01:34:11,136
I ain't passing the time of day
with no bunch of gravediggers.

738
01:34:11,536 --> 01:34:15,297
Now goddammit, Lieutenant, let me sit.

739
01:34:17,416 --> 01:34:19,137
It's not Christian.

740
01:34:21,497 --> 01:34:24,497
That's right, Lieutenant, it's not.

741
01:34:24,897 --> 01:34:26,817
Rider coming in!

742
01:34:31,256 --> 01:34:33,697
You're right. It's Ke-Ni-Tay.

743
01:35:08,817 --> 01:35:10,697
We're about ready to move, sir.

744
01:35:14,497 --> 01:35:17,657
Mr. Mclntosh will be staying behind
at his own request.

745
01:35:18,698 --> 01:35:21,537
Yes, sir. What about Ulzana?

746
01:35:22,818 --> 01:35:23,897
Bury him.

747
01:35:24,297 --> 01:35:27,217
They'd most like to see the body,
or at least the head.

748
01:35:27,618 --> 01:35:31,458
They'll see my report.
- Yes, sir. I'll see to it, sir.

749
01:35:31,858 --> 01:35:32,857
No.

750
01:35:33,737 --> 01:35:36,217
I see to it.

751
01:35:37,218 --> 01:35:38,777
Alright, Corporal.

752
01:35:42,818 --> 01:35:44,498
Mr. Mclntosh.

753
01:35:46,697 --> 01:35:48,137
Mr. DeBuin.

754
01:35:56,857 --> 01:35:58,298
Scout!

755
01:36:02,057 --> 01:36:03,577
Mount up!

756
01:36:03,977 --> 01:36:06,177
Prepare to mount!

757
01:36:06,578 --> 01:36:08,137
Mount!

758
01:36:31,778 --> 01:36:33,738
Ready to move out, Corporal?
- Yes, sir.

759
01:36:36,258 --> 01:36:38,098
Let's move them out!

760
01:36:38,498 --> 01:36:40,378
Forwards at a walk!
