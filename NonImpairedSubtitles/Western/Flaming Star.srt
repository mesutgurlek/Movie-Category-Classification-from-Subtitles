1
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:44,158
No lights.

2
00:02:47,607 --> 00:02:51,077
-What do you think?
-Too quiet.

3
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:09,678
Ma?

4
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:13,884
-Pa?
-Happy birthday!

5
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:18,682
-We couldnt resist. Even Pacer jumped.
-Where you been?

6
00:03:18,847 --> 00:03:22,044
lt sure is a surprise,
since my birthday was last week.

7
00:03:22,207 --> 00:03:24,846
lts the first chance we had
to come out.

8
00:03:25,007 --> 00:03:26,998
Wash up. Supper will be out.

9
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:30,204

Eat up!

11
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:34,319
Well do that.

12
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,838
How about this one?

13
00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:49,559
Hey, Dorothy, never mind those dishes.

14
00:03:49,727 --> 00:03:52,002
May l?

15
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:20,003
-Suppers ready.
-Supper!

16
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:23,204
-Sure is a fine-looking cake.
-l could eat a buffalo.

17
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:25,358
y ou dance like one.

18
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:32,277
Supper was great, Mrs. Burton.

. . .well, our ma or anybody else.

21
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:44,086
lm really proud you liked it, Tom.
Just a little more cake?

22
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:46,887
No, maam.

23
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:52,564
-What have we here?
-From me.

24
00:05:58,607 --> 00:06:00,757
Well, now, that. . . .

25
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:04,882
That sure is fine.

26
00:06:08,047 --> 00:06:09,878
What is it?

27
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:15,563
Well, you hang it on the wall. . .

28
00:06:15,727 --> 00:06:17,763
. . .and you put hot water in here.

29
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:22,557
lts mostly for a man to shave by,
but you can comb your hair in it. . .

30
00:06:23,847 --> 00:06:25,485
. . .or anything.

31
00:06:25,647 --> 00:06:26,841
lt sure is fine.

32
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:31,440
Roz is trying to civilize Clint
against the day he proposes.

33
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:34,838
-lf he gets around to it.
-y ou wear the britches. . .

34
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,918
. . .maybe you ought to propose.

35
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:40,602
Pacer and me can look more presentable
when we come to the Crossing.

36
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,042
l thank you all, for everything.

37
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:46,995
-More coffee, anyone?
-l think we best be going.

38
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:50,364
-We can make room here for anyone.
-No, thanks.

39
00:06:50,527 --> 00:06:53,041
We better go too,
1 0 miles can be long.

40
00:06:53,207 --> 00:06:56,244
Ten? Me and Roz gotta
go clear to the Crossing.

41
00:06:56,407 --> 00:06:59,046
The way she rides,
youll make good time. . .

42
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:01,243
. . .if you can keep up with her.

43
00:07:01,407 --> 00:07:03,557
Well ride along with you a ways.

44
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:06,116
-Thank you, Mrs. Burton.

00:07:06,287 --> 00:07:08,084

47
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:27,241
-Good night! Good night!
-Good night!

48
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:29,040
Take good care of her.

49
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:32,040
We better go or we wont get home
by morning.

50
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:33,196
Thanks again.

51
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:35,801
-Good night, Clint.
-Good night.

52
00:07:36,087 --> 00:07:38,203
-Good night, Roz.
-Night, Pacer.

53
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:43,801
-Whats that look for?
-Just thinking.

54
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:48,597
With that fancy gadget to primp,
youll be the prettiest fella in Texas.

55
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:11,079
Will you be quiet?
No use waking everybody up.

56
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:15,320
-lll put up the rig.
-lll get us some coffee.

57
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,324
Quiet!

58
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:46,925
Will, l tell you. . .

59
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:50,443
. . .you gotta stop
all this fooling around.

60
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:55,285
Making all this noise, l tell you,
the old mans gonna be--

61
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,965
See him?

62
00:09:49,407 --> 00:09:51,045
Hunter?

63
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:18,798
lts hot out there.

64
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:44,045
lndian came up on that hill just now.

65
00:10:44,247 --> 00:10:46,602
Pacer says hes no hunter.

66
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:50,517
Tie up the horses.

67
00:11:03,647 --> 00:11:07,560
-What is it, Sam?
-Not sure yet.

68
00:11:12,407 --> 00:11:15,843
He looked like he was trying
to figure something out.

69
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:20,200
Nobody said anything about trouble
at the party the other night.

70
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:21,800
No, sir.

71
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:25,000
A lot of things can happen
in three days.

72
00:11:26,087 --> 00:11:30,126
Neddy, last time you saw your sister,
you hear anything?

73
00:11:30,287 --> 00:11:33,484
No, it was just about like always.

74
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:37,563
Didnt you think so, Pacer?

75
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:54,362
lf trouble starts, wholl hit us
first, your folks or Mas?

76
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:58,805
Shame on you, Clint. lts more likely
neither will bother us.

77
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:02,755
That aint been my experience
about people in the middle.

78
00:12:02,927 --> 00:12:05,122
Maybe its the new chief.

79
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:09,239
-What new chief?
-The Kiowas got a new chief.

80
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:12,041
-Since when?
-Maybe a month.

81
00:12:12,207 --> 00:12:16,485
-What about old Lame Crow?
-Hes the old man of the tribe now.

82
00:12:16,647 --> 00:12:19,207
-How long you known this?
-Since it happened.

83
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:23,640
-Dont you ever tell anybody anything?
-Not if they dont ask.

84
00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:28,044
Sometimes l think youre
more than half lndian.

85
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:30,357
-He told me.
-Maybe youre the other half.

86
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:34,361
Maybe your ma was lndian too
and didnt let me know it.

87
00:12:38,247 --> 00:12:40,203
One horse.

88
00:13:03,807 --> 00:13:07,720
-Are you my brother beyond the wall?
-y es.

89
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:12,598
Then why light go out
when friend come in peace?

90
00:13:12,807 --> 00:13:16,595
Why does a friend who comes in peace
wait until the sun is gone?

91
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:19,156
Warrior ride when stars are alive.

92
00:13:19,327 --> 00:13:23,206
-Only against his enemies.
-ln the world of white men. . .

93
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:26,518
. . .there are men who are not enemies
nor friends.

94
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:30,396
-That is why l come to talk.
-Without giving your name?

95
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:33,479
l am known from one end
of earth to the other.

96
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:37,965
l have the strongest magic,
and l lead many, many warriors.

97
00:13:38,407 --> 00:13:40,875
l am Buffalo Horn.

98
00:13:41,047 --> 00:13:42,366
Buffalo Horn!

99
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:46,446
We cannot be enemies to the Kiowas
without being enemies to ourselves.

100
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:51,443
-Buffalo Horn should know that.
-l must see your eyes when you tell me.

101
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:55,436
-Do you come out, or do l come in?
-Neither.

102
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:59,077
We will talk to our brother
only in the sunlight.

103
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:12,203
y our answer is honest.

104
00:14:12,447 --> 00:14:17,885
l will return again at a time
when the sun has killed the stars.

105
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:25,205
-That was him.
-The new chief?

106
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:28,245
-By himself?
-The others were over the hill.

107
00:14:28,407 --> 00:14:30,159
What do you think?

108
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:34,240
He was carrying a war spear
with scalps on it.

109
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:37,077
They wouldnt do anything to us.

110
00:14:37,247 --> 00:14:39,078
Maybe not.

111
00:14:39,447 --> 00:14:43,486
l wouldnt be too sure.
Know what some of them still call you?

112
00:14:43,687 --> 00:14:46,201
A trader said they got a name for you:

113
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:49,837
创The thin woman
who deserted her own people. 创

114
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:54,285
-After more than 20 years.
-l dont believe it.

115
00:14:54,447 --> 00:14:59,601
y ou boys better go to the Crossing
tomorrow for supplies and ammunition.

116
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:02,565
Thats fine. Fine.

117
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:03,955
Not so fine.

118
00:15:04,127 --> 00:15:08,484
Wont be any time to dally with Roz.
l want you back by nightfall.

119
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:14,806
y ou heard Pa,
no horsing around with Roz.

120
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:17,197
What do you mean 创horsing around创?

121
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:20,040
-Aint that what youre doing?
-No, it aint.

122
00:15:20,207 --> 00:15:22,482
-y ou mean you mean it?
-What if l do?

123
00:15:22,687 --> 00:15:27,363
-With a gal that wears britches?
-Whats wrong with that?

124
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:30,125
Aint nothing wrong, but. . .

125
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:34,485
. . .on second thought, you might
look pretty good with skirts on.

126
00:15:54,647 --> 00:15:56,842
Where is everybody?

127
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,363
Anybody here?

128
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:25,319
lve been thinking about you, Clint.

129
00:16:25,487 --> 00:16:29,480
-Whats the matter, Angus?
-lve decided that youre my friend.

130
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:33,401
But if your half-breed brother
comes here, lll kill him!

131
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:35,638
y oure not gonna kill anybody.

132
00:16:39,447 --> 00:16:41,165
y ou!

133
00:16:41,327 --> 00:16:45,206
-Dont make me shoot you!
-Put it down, Angus, he means it!

134
00:16:46,447 --> 00:16:49,519
y ou better get out of here,
both of you.

135
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:52,879
-Are you both crazy?!
-No, were not crazy.

136
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:57,006
-Maybe just smarter than before.
-What are you talking about?

137
00:16:57,167 --> 00:17:00,762
The Kiowas hit the Howard place
the night of the party.

138
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:05,045
Of the whole family, you know how much
they found in the ashes?

139
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:07,243
One hand!

140
00:17:07,407 --> 00:17:10,319
-One of Dorothys!
-Stop it!

141
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:13,320
Now hes out making a coffin for her.

142
00:17:13,487 --> 00:17:16,320
Just to bury her hand in.

143
00:17:16,487 --> 00:17:18,398
Oh, my God.

144
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:21,525
-They didnt hit your place, though.
-No.

145
00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:24,201
And youre right out the same way.

146
00:17:24,447 --> 00:17:25,436
l dont know--

147
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:30,681
Pas out with some men now.
Theyll probably get killed too.

148
00:17:31,487 --> 00:17:34,399
But you dont have to worry about it.

149
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:37,759
y oull always be safe from them!

150
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:47,119
Lets go.

151
00:17:48,407 --> 00:17:52,116
No. Not until we get our supplies
and ammunition.

152
00:17:57,967 --> 00:18:00,162
Everything all right?

153
00:18:03,247 --> 00:18:05,363
Nothings all right.

154
00:18:12,847 --> 00:18:14,565
What happened?

155
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:17,560
Buffalo Horn hit the Howard place.

156
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:20,805
-Killed them all.
-Dear God!

157
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:25,563
lf you hadnt tended them for fever,
theyd be dead four years ago.

158
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,804
At these times l wonder
if we did the right thing.

159
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:36,444
We did exactly the right thing.
l wish you wouldnt say such things.

160
00:18:36,607 --> 00:18:40,122
What does everybody want?
Theres a million miles here. . .

161
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,721
. . .room for them, us,
and a million more.

162
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:44,479
lt was their land, Sam.

163
00:18:44,647 --> 00:18:47,719
They dont like anybody else
taking part of it.

164
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,076
lt aint anymore.

165
00:18:49,247 --> 00:18:53,877
Weve worked this place for 20 years.
Nobody can tell me it aint ours.

166
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:57,039
Did those Pierces say something
about us?

167
00:18:57,327 --> 00:19:01,639
-Nothing much.
-Whatever they said, its my fault. . .

168
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,640
. . .for being what l am.

169
00:19:04,807 --> 00:19:08,959
Neddy, now, you listen to me.
lm speaking for the boys and me.

170
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:11,806
We dont want to hear
such things again.

171
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:15,283
Whatever happens,
well stick together. . .

172
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:17,244
. . .and well not be swayed.

173
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:21,639
lf we have to live alone or
become a power unto ourselves. . .

174
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:25,482
. . .well resist whoever and whatever
comes against us.

175
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:02,957
-Hey, Clint!
-Dred Pierce.

176
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:06,085
We want to talk to you, Clint.

177
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,363
Theyre not gonna do anything.

178
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:38,159
What do you want, Dred?

179
00:20:38,327 --> 00:20:42,081
The Kiowas hit the Howard place Monday.
Wiped them out.

180
00:20:42,247 --> 00:20:45,045
We heard about it.
lts a terrible thing.

181
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:47,238
Howd you hear about it?

182
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:50,717
Me and Pacer was at the store
this morning.

183
00:20:50,887 --> 00:20:55,244
-The lndians didnt tell you about it?
-l dont want to hear that.

184
00:20:55,407 --> 00:20:59,195
Theres gonna be trouble.
lndians coming from everywhere.

185
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:02,200
More than a hundred already,
lve been told.

186
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:05,882
Weve been tracking the ones
that hit the Howard place. . .

187
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:08,436
-. . .but we lost them.
-Get to the point.

188
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:13,957
The point is, if it comes to a showdown,
are you with us or not?

189
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:17,523
-Thats a foolish question.
-Not with your family.

190
00:21:17,727 --> 00:21:21,402
Watch yourself. y ou might
open your mouth once too often.

191
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:24,877
-y ou gonna answer the question?
-lt dont need an answer.

192
00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:26,958
-What did l tell you?
-lt does.

193
00:21:27,127 --> 00:21:30,517
y eah, l think we got all the answers
already. . .

194
00:21:30,687 --> 00:21:33,997
. . .with all the reds and half-reds
in this family.

195
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,725
Hold it!

196
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:41,486
The first man who tries for his gun
will get a buffalo slug.

197
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:43,717
Come back here, son.

198
00:21:45,407 --> 00:21:50,037
y ou making out that the death of
old friends dont mean anything to us?

199
00:21:50,207 --> 00:21:52,960
-That aint the question.
-Then what is it?

200
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:57,285
-Well, its a question of loyalty.
-Go on.

201
00:21:58,247 --> 00:22:02,206
y ou know what l mean.
y our wife is Kiowa, full blood.

202
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:06,486
Pacers half lndian.
Clints the only real white man.

203
00:22:06,687 --> 00:22:12,637
lts gonna be a bad war. Everybody
around will be in it sooner or later.

204
00:22:12,807 --> 00:22:17,085
Are you gonna give Clint the chance
to consider the situation. . .

205
00:22:17,247 --> 00:22:20,842
-. . .and decide what he ought to do?
-l dont need to consider.

206
00:22:21,047 --> 00:22:23,515
l told you we wouldnt get
straight answers.

207
00:22:23,727 --> 00:22:27,879
Buffalo Horns our enemy because
of what he done to the Howards.

208
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:30,003
He broke Gods and mans laws.

209
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:33,318
y ou know my family is ready
to fight our enemies.

210
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:37,526
-ls that straight enough for you?
-l suppose you mean us too.

211
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:43,480
Thats up to you, Ben. Were friends
with anyone whos friendly with us.

212
00:22:43,647 --> 00:22:45,717
This visit aint been friendly.

213
00:22:45,927 --> 00:22:50,443
Who wants to be friendly with a man
with a Kiowa squaw?

214
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:54,005
Dont shoot! Nobody else shoot!

215
00:22:54,287 --> 00:22:56,437
-How is it?
-lm bad hurt.

216
00:22:56,647 --> 00:23:01,516
-Lucky it wasnt me, youd be dead.
-Bring him in. Maybe l can help.

217
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:06,562
-l wouldnt let an lndian touch me.
-We got about all the answer we need.

218
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:09,839
Then get going, all of you!

219
00:23:22,287 --> 00:23:24,357
y ou shoot too quick?

220
00:23:24,527 --> 00:23:29,237
No, l pulled off. l couldnt
just kill him, just like that.

221
00:23:39,607 --> 00:23:42,326
-What are they doing?
-Stampeding the cattle.

222
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,557
-No use now!
-Theres a couple.

223
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:50,324
-Stop him, Clint.
-Pacer! Pa dont want you to.

224
00:23:51,367 --> 00:23:55,645
-Why not go after them?
-Because wed be too few out there.

225
00:23:55,807 --> 00:23:58,002
Harms done, anyway.

226
00:24:01,047 --> 00:24:03,083
Come on in.

227
00:24:04,287 --> 00:24:08,246
These are what we call
our white friends, l suppose.

228
00:24:09,527 --> 00:24:14,317
lt may take more than a day, so dont
worry if we dont get back tonight.

229
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,762
Stay close, keep everything locked.

230
00:24:16,927 --> 00:24:19,964
What if the fellas from the Crossing
come back?

231
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:24,484
Think about Ma. Take care of her
regardless of who comes.

232
00:24:47,047 --> 00:24:48,799
Pacer.

233
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:52,359
Watch up yonder.

234
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:58,164
-What was it?
-For a second it looked like. . .

235
00:24:58,327 --> 00:25:01,125
. . .like a man on foot, way off,
up there.

236
00:25:01,287 --> 00:25:04,597
-Didnt you see anything?
-No.

237
00:25:04,767 --> 00:25:09,318
lf its somebody, he might need help.
Maybe you should go see.

238
00:25:09,487 --> 00:25:13,924
l dont see anything, Ma.
Pa said stay near the house.

239
00:25:18,247 --> 00:25:22,365
y ou think about what Pierce said,
about joining his crowd?

240
00:25:22,527 --> 00:25:26,759
-l havent paid it any mind.
-Maybe youd better think about it.

241
00:25:26,927 --> 00:25:30,806
l didnt aim to, but l brought you
boys to a bad situation.

242
00:25:30,967 --> 00:25:35,916
lt didnt matter when you were young,
but now as men, youll think about it.

243
00:25:36,087 --> 00:25:41,115
So if you want to ride with Dred
and them, lll try to understand.

244
00:25:41,287 --> 00:25:43,084
y oull go with my blessing.

245
00:25:43,247 --> 00:25:46,319
y ou already said it.
Theres only one side for us. . .

246
00:25:46,487 --> 00:25:49,206
. . .you, and Ma, and Pacer and me.

247
00:25:51,487 --> 00:25:53,603
Oh, no.

248
00:25:53,767 --> 00:25:56,964
-They shot them!
-l shouldve killed Matt Holcum.

249
00:25:57,127 --> 00:25:59,402
We shouldve cut them all down.

250
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:01,319
Theyre worse than lndians!

251
00:26:01,487 --> 00:26:05,605
An lndian will rob you blind,
but this is waste and meanness.

252
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:07,644
lts done.

253
00:26:08,287 --> 00:26:11,006
Lets find the rest of the herd.

254
00:26:33,567 --> 00:26:37,401
Pacer, you ought to get
a little sleep at least.

255
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:42,277
-lll be all right. Go on back to bed.
-Good night, Pacer.

256
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:44,199
Ma.

257
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:47,761
-What is it?
-l dont know yet.

258
00:26:51,927 --> 00:26:53,485
Strangers.

259
00:26:54,687 --> 00:26:56,166
Hey, in there!

260
00:26:57,327 --> 00:26:58,601
y eah?

261
00:26:59,407 --> 00:27:01,523
Can you maybe spare a bite?

262
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:05,040
-Who are you?
-Were trappers.

263
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:09,041
-We got chased out of the hills.
-Too much trouble brewing.

264
00:27:09,207 --> 00:27:12,483
Were getting out of this country.
Were half-starved.

265
00:27:12,687 --> 00:27:14,484
Let them in.

266
00:27:15,487 --> 00:27:18,559
-l aint sure.
-We cant turn them away hungry.

267
00:27:30,807 --> 00:27:33,196
Sure mighty neighborly of you.

268
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,047
-Hey, you lndians?
-y eah.

269
00:27:38,207 --> 00:27:41,165
-y ou two work here?
-This is our home.

270
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:46,162
How do you like that?
lndians living in a house like this.

271
00:27:46,327 --> 00:27:50,115
-How about getting us supper, red boy?
-lm fixing something.

272
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:52,801
ls that your ma?

273
00:27:54,487 --> 00:27:57,763
-What are you making, honey?
-Meat stew.

274
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:01,840
l have to warm it up a little.
Get me another log, Pacer.

275
00:28:02,007 --> 00:28:04,521
y oull sit down at the table.

276
00:28:04,687 --> 00:28:08,566
-Didnt you hear your ma, red boy?
-Whats the matter?

277
00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:12,276
-Nothing.
-Then hurry up and get it.

278
00:28:25,407 --> 00:28:29,241
Wheres the heap big chief?

279
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:32,524
y our husband, or whoever he is.

280
00:28:32,687 --> 00:28:36,521
Hell be back soon.
But hes not a chief, hes white.

281
00:28:36,687 --> 00:28:39,360
Oh? Thats it, huh?

282
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:41,797
y ou like them white?

283
00:28:42,247 --> 00:28:44,397
l like my husband.

284
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:49,402
That aint all, is it? One man
for a good-looking squaw like you?

285
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:51,683
Please.

286
00:28:52,327 --> 00:28:55,285
Come on. l know you red babies.

287
00:28:55,447 --> 00:28:58,041
-Please, mister.
-What are you afraid of?

288
00:28:58,207 --> 00:29:00,721
-Joe will watch the door.
-Let me go.

289
00:29:00,927 --> 00:29:03,566
All right, l tell you what.

290
00:29:03,727 --> 00:29:08,755
y ou just give me one little kiss,
and see if you dont want a few more.

291
00:29:15,807 --> 00:29:19,277
Pa and Clint are back.
Theyll be in, in a minute.

292
00:29:20,207 --> 00:29:24,564
These men cant wait.
Theyre leaving now.

293
00:29:42,727 --> 00:29:44,604
Pacer.

294
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:57,676
lf it hadnt been for that kid--

295
00:29:57,847 --> 00:30:00,805
All right. Get off your horses.

296
00:30:01,727 --> 00:30:04,082
Did you hear what l said?

297
00:30:05,967 --> 00:30:09,721
Drop your gun belts.
Come on, hurry it up.

298
00:30:12,487 --> 00:30:15,923
lf youre aiming to rob us,
youre wasting your time.

299
00:30:16,087 --> 00:30:17,600
We aint got anything.

300
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:20,645
l might kill you, but l
aint gonna rob you.

301
00:30:20,807 --> 00:30:26,245
-Weve had enough trouble with lndians.
-All he asked for was a little kiss.

302
00:30:27,807 --> 00:30:30,275
lm telling you, now, boy.

303
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:39,959

-l wanted to make sure they went away.
-Thats all?

00:32:03,967 --> 00:32:06,162
y oure bleeding.

310
00:32:06,887 --> 00:32:09,355
l tripped in the dark.

311
00:32:11,327 --> 00:32:15,161
y ou landed awful hard
on your knuckles.

312
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:37,755
lnside, Ma! lnside, come on!

313
00:33:00,927 --> 00:33:02,440
Two Moons is with them.

314
00:33:02,687 --> 00:33:05,520
-Kiowa Pacer!
-y es?

315
00:33:10,287 --> 00:33:14,997
lt is a new time. The sun has killed
the stars. Come out and talk!

316
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:18,245
l will not come out
among your warriors.

317
00:33:18,447 --> 00:33:22,838
lm your friend. Nothing will happen
to you if you come out.

318
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:27,040
Nothing will happen to me
if l stay behind my walls either.

319
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:37,961
Now you come out?

320
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:46,966
Wait a minute!
Give me your rifle. Put this on!

321
00:33:53,527 --> 00:33:56,360
lf anything happens, bolt the door.

322
00:34:19,527 --> 00:34:25,079
This is how men talk, with their eyes
seeing if words are true or false.

323
00:34:25,327 --> 00:34:29,764
-y ou talk, l will listen.
-l need many, many more warriors.

324
00:34:30,007 --> 00:34:35,559
The white man is thick from
the rising sun to the setting sun.

325
00:34:35,967 --> 00:34:38,765
We have no place to go.

326
00:34:38,967 --> 00:34:43,722
We have to fight, or we die.
y ou understand?

327
00:34:48,327 --> 00:34:52,559
This is the great war our gods
have spoken to us in our dreams.

328
00:34:52,767 --> 00:34:58,160
Soon we will have the power
to take whole white villages!

329
00:34:59,087 --> 00:35:02,966
y ou say you are not our enemy.
Then you must be friend.

330
00:35:03,887 --> 00:35:06,481
Will you ride with us?

331
00:35:06,727 --> 00:35:10,959
y ou have many warriors.
One more warrior is not important.

332
00:35:11,887 --> 00:35:14,765
y ou are of the greatest
importance to me.

333
00:35:15,007 --> 00:35:20,764
For if a half-white leaves his fathers
people for his mothers people. . .

334
00:35:20,967 --> 00:35:23,879
. . .itll make the strongest magic
l can have.

335
00:35:24,127 --> 00:35:25,845
lf l say no?

336
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:32,956
Not being my friend,
you will be my enemy.

337
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:35,601
And this house and all in it will die!

338
00:35:35,847 --> 00:35:38,964
For l will not have
a half-Kiowa against me!

339
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:44,157
-Come in here a minute, Pacer.
-l must talk to my mother.

340
00:35:53,727 --> 00:35:56,400
-Well go back with him.
-Back where?

341
00:35:56,647 --> 00:36:00,356
To their camp.
lll talk this over with Lame Crow.

342
00:36:00,607 --> 00:36:05,078
-y ou mean, about me?
-The whole thing, war and everything.

343
00:36:05,327 --> 00:36:08,160
Lame Crows my uncle,
maybe he can stop it.

344
00:36:08,407 --> 00:36:11,365
They wouldnt care
about what you said.

345
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:13,364
lll try it anyway.

346
00:36:13,567 --> 00:36:18,243
l cant see all these people being
killed without trying to stop it.

347
00:36:18,487 --> 00:36:22,765
-Write Pa where were going.
-Ma, wait and talk to Pa first.

348
00:36:23,007 --> 00:36:27,762
No, hed lock me up or something.
Tell him well be back by midnight.

349
00:36:28,007 --> 00:36:31,363
l cant let you do it, Ma.
lts too dangerous.

350
00:36:32,967 --> 00:36:37,882
But they wouldnt hurt us, Pacer.
Theyre our own people.

351
00:36:38,127 --> 00:36:42,564
They aint my people. Truthfully,
l dont know whos my people.

352
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,803
Maybe l aint got any.

353
00:36:45,767 --> 00:36:49,362
l couldnt ride with those guys,
burning and killing.

354
00:36:49,567 --> 00:36:50,966
l know, Pacer.

355
00:36:51,207 --> 00:36:55,564
-Thats what hes asking me to do, Ma!
-y ou can say no.

356
00:36:55,767 --> 00:37:00,283
l can say no here. What if he asks
me there, in the middle of them?

357
00:37:00,527 --> 00:37:03,963
But he wouldnt do that.
y oud be his guest.

358
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:08,160
y ou havent seen his eyes
when he talks about this war.

359
00:37:08,407 --> 00:37:12,764
Hell ask me, all right, guest or not.
And if l dont say yes. . . .

360
00:37:13,007 --> 00:37:18,365
Then l dont think you ought
to go either. lll go alone.

361
00:37:31,607 --> 00:37:36,681
This is so important, my mother thinks
we should talk to her family.

362
00:37:36,927 --> 00:37:41,159
-y oull come to the safety of our camp?
-y es.

363
00:37:41,367 --> 00:37:44,165
y our mother is wise.

364
00:37:44,767 --> 00:37:47,361
We will ride with you.

365
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:14,804
-What do you think about this war?
-Buffalo Horn say it got to be.

366
00:38:15,047 --> 00:38:19,563
He say if we wait any longer
it will be too late.

367
00:38:20,247 --> 00:38:23,956
lt must be harder for you,
half white, half lndian.

368
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:25,885
lt is not easy.

369
00:38:26,127 --> 00:38:31,565
-White men treat you well?
-My father and brother do.

370
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:05,198
lf anything starts,
take my horse and ride out.

371
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:27,365
Welcome, Neddee-pahs.

372
00:39:29,007 --> 00:39:34,479
-l come to you with love, and gifts.
-Show me.

373
00:39:34,687 --> 00:39:38,680
Take her to Lame Crow.
She wants to talk to him.

374
00:39:38,927 --> 00:39:40,565
Come.

375
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:56,959
Sit.

376
00:39:58,367 --> 00:40:00,961
Pacer is brother.

377
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:05,365
We make him welcome. Speak, anyone.

378
00:40:05,567 --> 00:40:11,676
Kiowa Pacer, is true Earth round
like ball? White man live all sides?

379
00:40:12,127 --> 00:40:13,799
That is true.

380
00:40:14,047 --> 00:40:17,357
Tell me, why man
on bottom not fall off?

381
00:40:18,887 --> 00:40:22,357
lve never been there. Maybe they do.

382
00:40:34,047 --> 00:40:39,201
创Dear Pa and Clint,
Ma took a notion to see her sister.

383
00:40:39,447 --> 00:40:44,965
l told her not, but you know Ma.
l think we will be back by midnight.

384
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:48,398
l tried to make her not go,
but you know Ma.

385
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:51,957
Respectfully yours, Pacer. 创

386
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:55,523
Now, why do you reckon
she wanted to do that?

387
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:58,964
-Well go after them.
-Wait a minute.

388
00:41:00,087 --> 00:41:03,045
Ten oclock. Wed better wait
the two hours. . .

389
00:41:03,287 --> 00:41:05,801
. . .rather than miss them in the dark.

390
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:09,403
Then well go after them
with the scatterguns.

391
00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:15,199
lf they do anything to Ma and Pacer,
scatterguns can make an awful mess.

392
00:41:36,807 --> 00:41:39,719
Many moon back, l see white man book.

393
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:44,524
ln it was great mountain lion
with stripe painted on fur.

394
00:41:44,767 --> 00:41:50,603
Speak me this, Kiowa Pacer. Why white
man paint stripe on mountain lion?

395
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,765
That was a great animal
called a tiger.

396
00:41:54,007 --> 00:41:56,567
They didnt paint the stripes on it.

397
00:41:56,807 --> 00:42:01,164
Could be then,
this great tiger paint on own stripes.

398
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:05,360
Which make tiger brother
to my Kiowa warriors.

399
00:42:16,287 --> 00:42:19,836
We didnt speak about the thing
l came to talk about.

400
00:42:20,087 --> 00:42:24,365
y es. My spirit reached out
and touched you. . .

401
00:42:24,567 --> 00:42:28,560
. . .and l knew it was not good
to speak of it now.

402
00:42:29,727 --> 00:42:34,357
lt will be hard for you to come back
to us. y ou are not yet ready.

403
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:38,958
lf l asked you now to say yes or no,
you might say no.

404
00:42:39,167 --> 00:42:42,000
Or you might lie to me and say yes.

405
00:42:42,247 --> 00:42:46,286
But l would know that you lie,
and ld have to kill you.

406
00:42:46,967 --> 00:42:49,481
We are close in spirit now.

407
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:52,287
l want you to come back
to your people.

408
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:55,763
-y ou think about it?
-l will.

409
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:59,761
Think of this too. Whose land is this?

410
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:03,004
Who has lived here
since the beginning of time?

411
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:07,286
Do we go out to take their land?
No, they come against us!

412
00:43:07,527 --> 00:43:10,564
Forever cutting deeper into our land.

413
00:43:10,767 --> 00:43:14,760
Forever taking! Forever pushing!

414
00:43:17,367 --> 00:43:21,155
We will speak of it again soon.

415
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:28,166
l hope your blood
will be one with ours.

416
00:43:39,407 --> 00:43:41,159
Two Moons.

417
00:43:42,407 --> 00:43:44,762
Take me to Lame Crow.

418
00:43:48,367 --> 00:43:51,757
l will ride part of the way
back with you.

419
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,558
Ready, Ma?

420
00:43:59,007 --> 00:44:02,158
l go in goodwill.

421
00:44:27,727 --> 00:44:29,957
lts all right, Ma.

422
00:44:32,007 --> 00:44:35,682
They wouldnt even listen to me.
None of them.

423
00:44:35,927 --> 00:44:40,955
They said l wasnt Kiowa anymore,
nor white either.

424
00:44:41,167 --> 00:44:45,080
My own sister said l was nothing!

425
00:44:45,327 --> 00:44:48,160
y ou done the best you could, Ma.

426
00:45:03,927 --> 00:45:05,485
Kill them!

427
00:45:21,407 --> 00:45:22,965
Will!

428
00:45:23,447 --> 00:45:25,563
lts Will Howard!

429
00:45:28,207 --> 00:45:29,765
Ma?

430
00:45:36,407 --> 00:45:37,965
Ma?

431
00:45:38,207 --> 00:45:42,200
-Pacer, lm dying.
-No, Ma.

432
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:48,799
l can feel, close to me,
the flaming star of death.

433
00:45:49,007 --> 00:45:53,125
Stop talking like that, Ma.
l dont think its too bad.

434
00:45:54,247 --> 00:45:56,556
ltll be all right.

435
00:45:59,287 --> 00:46:02,006
-Who is it?
-lts me and Clint, Pacer!

436
00:46:02,367 --> 00:46:04,562
Ma is hurt!

437
00:46:11,487 --> 00:46:14,559
-lt was Will Howard that done it.
-Will Howard?

438
00:46:14,807 --> 00:46:17,765
-Two Moons tried to stop him.
-Honey?

439
00:46:18,007 --> 00:46:19,998
Neddy, honey!

440
00:46:20,247 --> 00:46:22,966
Lets put her in the back.

441
00:46:31,967 --> 00:46:35,755
-Clint.
-Were all here. y oull be all right.

442
00:46:36,007 --> 00:46:38,760
Were going home, honey.

443
00:46:51,927 --> 00:46:55,158
Thats all we can do for her now.

444
00:47:06,207 --> 00:47:10,359
-Tell me what happened.
-Will jumped up and started shooting.

445
00:47:10,607 --> 00:47:13,485
He must have been wandering
since the raid.

446
00:47:13,727 --> 00:47:18,437
-y ou think he knew what he was doing?
-He thought he saw three lndians.

447
00:47:18,687 --> 00:47:21,155
He must have been crazy with pain. . .

448
00:47:21,407 --> 00:47:25,002
. . .after what happened to his family.

449
00:47:25,247 --> 00:47:29,763
-y ou making excuses for him?
-Had you not killed him, we would have.

450
00:47:29,967 --> 00:47:32,765
-We need a doctor.
-lll get Doc Phillips.

451
00:47:33,007 --> 00:47:35,567
What if he dont want to come?

452
00:47:35,967 --> 00:47:37,958
He wont have a choice.

453
00:47:38,207 --> 00:47:40,767
Those folks are mad.
ld better go too.

454
00:47:40,967 --> 00:47:43,765
Try not to have any trouble,
but get him.

455
00:47:43,967 --> 00:47:46,162
Well get him.

456
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,566
Dred, theyre coming!

457
00:48:05,607 --> 00:48:07,245
Theyre here, Ben!

458
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:46,164
-Dont worry about shooting our cattle.
-Dont come no closer!

459
00:48:46,407 --> 00:48:49,558
We dont want
to see you boys here again.

460
00:48:49,767 --> 00:48:51,519
We need Doc Phillips.

461
00:48:51,767 --> 00:48:56,477
y ou dont need him any more
than we do. y ou know what l mean!

462
00:48:56,727 --> 00:48:58,638

467
00:49:11,007 --> 00:49:14,477
-Now, if hes just dead, who killed him?
-Me.

468
00:49:14,727 --> 00:49:18,402

All right, lets go.

520
00:57:09,407 --> 00:57:10,965
Neddy?

521
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:20,763
Neddy!

522
00:57:45,607 --> 00:57:47,598
Neddy!

523
00:58:00,247 --> 00:58:02,203
Neddy, honey!

524
00:58:02,447 --> 00:58:04,961
Answer me!

525
00:58:12,407 --> 00:58:14,318
Honey!

526
00:58:25,287 --> 00:58:27,005
Neddy, honey!

527
00:58:27,247 --> 00:58:30,159
Neddy, why did you do it?

528
00:58:31,447 --> 00:58:33,165
Sam. . . .

529
00:58:33,767 --> 00:58:37,555
l saw the flaming star of death.

530
00:58:37,767 --> 00:58:39,564
Oh, no!

531
00:58:39,967 --> 00:58:41,764
No, honey!

532
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,765
No!

533
00:59:02,207 --> 00:59:05,756
One thing from the Bible she liked:

534
00:59:06,807 --> 00:59:10,436
创And Adam called
his wifes name Eve. . .

535
00:59:11,207 --> 00:59:13,926
. . .as she was the mother
of all living. 创

536
00:59:16,247 --> 00:59:20,763
To me, Neddy, you were the mother
of all the living.

537
00:59:22,127 --> 00:59:24,960
y ou were life itself.

538
00:59:30,527 --> 00:59:32,165
God. . .

539
00:59:32,407 --> 00:59:34,762
. . .just one thing.

540
00:59:35,887 --> 00:59:37,843
Take care of this woman.

541
00:59:40,807 --> 00:59:42,286
Amen.

542
01:00:22,607 --> 01:00:25,997
Why dont you two eat
before everything gets cold?

543
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:28,556
lm gonna wait for Pa.

544
01:00:28,807 --> 01:00:31,162
He wouldnt want you to wait.

545
01:00:31,367 --> 01:00:34,165
y ou know who done it, dont you?

546
01:00:34,407 --> 01:00:35,965
y ou!

547
01:00:37,047 --> 01:00:38,799
That wont do any good.

548
01:00:39,047 --> 01:00:42,357
Wasting all that time.
y ou and them other people!

549
01:00:42,607 --> 01:00:45,997
l couldnt have done anything.
l saw that wound--

550
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:49,404
-Nobody wanted to do anything!
-Thats not true.

551
01:00:49,647 --> 01:00:52,161
-And you neither!
-Stop that.

552
01:00:52,367 --> 01:00:56,758
But you saw him! Arguing and stalling,
all the time Mas dying!

553
01:00:57,007 --> 01:00:59,157
Keeping us more than an hour!

554
01:00:59,407 --> 01:01:02,205
Five minutes before we arrived,
she died!

555
01:01:02,527 --> 01:01:06,361
lf wed gotten here a little bit
sooner she might be alive!

556
01:01:06,527 --> 01:01:08,802
y ou know its his fault.

557
01:01:08,967 --> 01:01:11,117
-Put it down!
-Get out of the way!

558
01:01:11,287 --> 01:01:13,437
They let her die!

559
01:01:13,607 --> 01:01:17,759
l couldnt have saved her.
The woman was bleeding internally!

560
01:01:17,927 --> 01:01:18,916
The woman?

561
01:01:19,087 --> 01:01:21,521
-Shes got a name, like whites!
-Pacer!

562
01:01:21,687 --> 01:01:23,917
Well, l meant Mrs. Burton.

563
01:01:24,087 --> 01:01:26,920
See? All she was
to all of them was a squaw.

564
01:01:27,087 --> 01:01:28,725
This wont bring Ma back.

565
01:01:28,887 --> 01:01:30,878
A white man shot her. . .

566
01:01:31,047 --> 01:01:33,117
. . .and a white man let her die!

567
01:01:42,127 --> 01:01:44,322
Drop it!

568
01:01:52,247 --> 01:01:55,159
Please, Pacer, drop it.

569
01:01:56,287 --> 01:01:58,403
Please.

570
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:28,555
-y ou all right?
-y oure both crazy!

571
01:02:28,727 --> 01:02:31,366
y ou ought to have let me kill him.

572
01:02:32,167 --> 01:02:34,886
No good could be done.
lt wouldnt help.

573
01:02:35,047 --> 01:02:37,641
People that held us
up at the Crossing. . . .

574
01:02:37,807 --> 01:02:40,321
l want to see every one of them dead.

575
01:02:40,487 --> 01:02:43,445
y oure talking foolish.
y ou sound like a--

576
01:02:43,607 --> 01:02:45,086
A Kiowa?

577
01:02:47,007 --> 01:02:50,238
-l wasnt gonna say that.
-Thats what l am.

578
01:02:50,407 --> 01:02:53,126
Thats what Ma was and why shes dead.

579
01:02:53,287 --> 01:02:55,926
Thats what lm gonna be from now on.

580
01:02:56,087 --> 01:02:58,920
y ou know l didnt mean it that way.

581
01:02:59,087 --> 01:03:02,363
y ou dont feel it like
l do about Mas death.

582
01:03:02,527 --> 01:03:04,040
lm lndian.

583
01:03:04,207 --> 01:03:07,358
l wont forget whites killed
her because of it!

584
01:03:07,527 --> 01:03:12,442
-Will was dying, he was crazy!
-l dont want no more excuses for him.

585
01:03:12,607 --> 01:03:15,883
All whites ever gave me and Ma
was mean looks and insults.

586
01:03:16,047 --> 01:03:18,607
Thats not true!

587
01:03:19,047 --> 01:03:20,924
y ou were the worst.

588
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:23,965
y ou made me feel it the worst.

589
01:03:24,127 --> 01:03:26,595
When l was little, l liked you a lot.

590
01:03:26,767 --> 01:03:29,520
y ou were the only girl
l liked a whole lot.

591
01:03:29,687 --> 01:03:34,158
Since you been old enough, you never
looked at me without thinking:

592
01:03:34,327 --> 01:03:35,999
创Hes Kiowa.

593
01:03:36,167 --> 01:03:39,159
Clints all right,
but watch out for Pacer. 创

594
01:03:39,327 --> 01:03:40,840
Oh, l didnt know!

595
01:03:41,007 --> 01:03:43,396
l didnt know it either.

596
01:03:43,567 --> 01:03:46,320
Nobody knew but Ma and me.

597
01:03:50,127 --> 01:03:52,004
Where you going?

598
01:03:52,167 --> 01:03:55,876
-To join up with Buffalo Horn.
-y oure a civilized man!

599
01:03:56,047 --> 01:03:59,403
-Folks at the Crossing are civilized.
-y ou cant go.

600
01:03:59,567 --> 01:04:04,277
Now, look, we already had one fight.
The first one we ever had.

601
01:04:04,447 --> 01:04:06,802
l wont lose this one!

602
01:04:08,207 --> 01:04:11,995
This aint to be fought with fists.
lm changing my life.

603
01:04:12,167 --> 01:04:14,522
Put that gun down.

604
01:04:16,407 --> 01:04:18,716
All right.

605
01:04:18,887 --> 01:04:21,765
lf you can draw
that gun and cock it. . .

606
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:27,283
. . .then get out.

607
01:04:29,047 --> 01:04:30,526
And to hell with you!

608
01:04:30,687 --> 01:04:32,279
Just dont come after me.

609
01:05:08,567 --> 01:05:10,364

-Back to Mas folks?
-lm sorry.

01:05:16,967 --> 01:05:19,162
So am l, but l understand.

613
01:05:19,847 --> 01:05:23,362
lt never come to my mind it would be
like this when l married Neddy.

614
01:05:23,527 --> 01:05:27,076
l guess folks aint
never been fair with you.

615
01:05:27,247 --> 01:05:31,001
They take a man for what
he ought to be, not what he is.

616
01:05:31,167 --> 01:05:34,443
-l aint blaming you.
-l know. y oure a good boy.

617
01:05:34,607 --> 01:05:38,202

Do what you must do. . .

618
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:44,522
. . .with my blessings. No matter
where you go, whatever happens.

619
01:05:46,167 --> 01:05:48,761
Goodbye, son.

620
01:05:49,887 --> 01:05:51,525
Bye, Pa.

621
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:14,160
Funny how things turn out.

622
01:06:14,327 --> 01:06:19,685
When l got here, all l had was you
and me. y ou were just a baby.

623
01:06:19,847 --> 01:06:25,843
Then l gave Neddys father a shotgun
and a pound of black powder for her.

624
01:06:26,887 --> 01:06:29,481
What a pretty
little thing she was too!

625
01:06:29,647 --> 01:06:33,925
The day we got married there
wasnt a prettier girl in Texas.

626
01:06:37,447 --> 01:06:40,405
l cant tell you how much
l came to love her.

627
01:06:43,767 --> 01:06:48,557
After all these years, and another
little baby and all our work. . .

628
01:06:48,727 --> 01:06:52,003
. . .to make a home
and get us a herd. . . .

629
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:58,876
Were right back where we started.
Just you and me again.

630
01:07:43,247 --> 01:07:45,283
l will fight in his place.

631
01:07:45,447 --> 01:07:48,245
-Who did this?
-A white man.

632
01:07:48,407 --> 01:07:52,241
He also killed Neddee-pahs, the
woman who was my mother.

633
01:07:52,407 --> 01:07:55,285
My words are dust.
But my heart is with you.

634
01:07:55,847 --> 01:07:57,599
One thing you must know.

635
01:07:57,767 --> 01:08:00,918
l will never fight my father
nor my brother.

636
01:08:01,087 --> 01:08:04,045
y our father, your brother,
and your home. . .

637
01:08:04,207 --> 01:08:07,244
. . .will be safe from attack,
as our own people.

638
01:08:13,607 --> 01:08:16,599
When we fight, l will think
of my mother. . .

639
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:19,884
. . .and of how Two Moons
tried to help her.

640
01:08:20,047 --> 01:08:22,686
And l will be strong.

641
01:08:25,607 --> 01:08:28,167
Very strong.

642
01:08:41,207 --> 01:08:45,678
-lll be back to see you, Pa.
-y ou do that, Roz.

643
01:08:45,847 --> 01:08:50,443
-Well do the best we can anyway.
-Well sure try.

644
01:08:54,367 --> 01:08:56,517
That bay is still limping.

645
01:08:56,727 --> 01:09:00,720
lm giving you the sorrel.
Well give your horse back later.

646
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:03,276
-Bye, Pa.
-Bye.

647
01:09:03,447 --> 01:09:04,846
Dont go too far.

648
01:09:05,007 --> 01:09:09,080
-Let the herd take care of itself.
-lll be all right.

649
01:09:19,207 --> 01:09:22,916
l wont say what Pacer had in mind.
Hell be back.

650
01:09:23,087 --> 01:09:26,238
l dont know.
Hes been pushed a long way.

651
01:09:26,967 --> 01:09:30,755
-l wonder if youll be back.
-l said l would, didnt l?

652
01:09:30,927 --> 01:09:32,280
lts plain hate now.

653
01:09:32,447 --> 01:09:36,326
Everybodys ready to kill
anybody who isnt just like them.

654
01:09:36,487 --> 01:09:38,239
lll be back, all right.

655
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:41,797
-Get down and into the house!
-Dont talk like that.

656
01:09:41,967 --> 01:09:45,403
-lm no girl, lm a woman.
-Want me to pull you down?

657
01:09:45,567 --> 01:09:47,523
l dont.

658
01:09:51,367 --> 01:09:54,325
-y ou know Neddy died?
-l know a lot of things.

659
01:09:54,487 --> 01:09:59,402
l know Pacer went at doc with a knife.
l know the Thomases died last night.

660
01:09:59,567 --> 01:10:02,718
All four of them.
Nothing left but ashes!

661
01:10:03,247 --> 01:10:07,035
-lm sorry to hear that.
-y eah, lll bet.

662
01:10:07,207 --> 01:10:10,244
y ou know that Phil Thomas
was my best friend.

663
01:10:10,407 --> 01:10:13,080
Then why didnt you warn him?

664
01:10:15,847 --> 01:10:16,996
Goodbye, Roz.

665
01:10:17,167 --> 01:10:20,204
Wait, Dred!
y ou got room for us?

666
01:10:20,367 --> 01:10:23,439
Well make room for you!

667
01:10:24,047 --> 01:10:26,607
Thats the fifth wagon in
this morning.

668
01:10:26,767 --> 01:10:31,887
Theyre all scared to death. But l
guess you got nothing to worry about.

669
01:11:01,407 --> 01:11:03,523
He is alone. Let us kill him.

670
01:11:03,687 --> 01:11:07,726
Maybe its best if we find
Buffalo Horn before fighting.

671
01:11:07,887 --> 01:11:11,084
The gods are making
us a gift of this enemy.

672
01:16:10,767 --> 01:16:12,325
Hang on, Clint!

673
01:17:18,407 --> 01:17:21,126
l thought you were so tough!

674
01:17:21,967 --> 01:17:25,846
Feels like youre trying
to torture me to death.

675
01:17:26,007 --> 01:17:28,567
y ou damn savage!

676
01:17:35,367 --> 01:17:37,597
Can you hear me?

677
01:17:38,047 --> 01:17:42,962
-We have to get out of here.
-y ou go. lm too tired.

678
01:17:43,127 --> 01:17:46,278
We still got about
an hour before daylight.

679
01:17:48,447 --> 01:17:50,039
What are you doing?

680
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:54,837
lm gonna try and draw them
the other way. Theyd recognize this.

681
01:17:55,007 --> 01:17:56,998
Crazy.

682
01:17:57,167 --> 01:18:02,116
-Maybe in the dark lll look lndian.
-y our hairs too short.

683
01:18:03,967 --> 01:18:08,040
lf were not out of here by sunup,
itll be a lot shorter.

684
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:42,603
Were never gonna get
a better time than this.

685
01:21:46,607 --> 01:21:50,361
-Think you can hold on again?
-l can make it.

686
01:21:54,887 --> 01:21:58,846
Come on. Watch your head.

687
01:22:29,047 --> 01:22:31,402
They still coming?

688
01:22:31,967 --> 01:22:34,686
y eah, but theyre in no hurry anymore.

689
01:22:34,847 --> 01:22:36,360
Why?

690
01:22:36,527 --> 01:22:39,963
They know who we are now,
and where to find us.

691
01:22:57,127 --> 01:22:58,480
Hey, Pa!

692
01:22:58,647 --> 01:22:59,762

-Were all the family we got left now.
-Thats right.

696
01:23:31,167 --> 01:23:33,965
We got to get in the house
and get ready.

697
01:23:41,167 --> 01:23:42,998
Pacer?

698
01:23:47,167 --> 01:23:49,044
Pacer!

-Are you coming with me?
-Nope.

-Thats crazy. There are too many.

705
01:24:36,287 --> 01:24:41,361
But if its gonna be like this

Let me meet them with you.

Dont try to help me, Clint.

-Let me get the doc.
-Too late.

01:26:50,127 --> 01:26:51,719
Too late.

724
01:26:51,887 --> 01:26:54,481
The only thing to do now is to die.

725
01:26:54,647 --> 01:26:57,764
