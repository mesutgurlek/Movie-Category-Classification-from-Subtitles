it's better not to fight,

330
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:47,213
and other times...
You must fight the ones you love.

331
00:29:01,394 --> 00:29:03,325
When I saw what you were wearing...

332
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:08,372
When I saw what you had
prepared for your brother,

333
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:12,571
I hoped that you would return to me.

334
00:29:24,248 --> 00:29:26,473
But now, I see in your eyes...

335
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,688
You are becoming your own man.

336
00:29:36,026 --> 00:29:42,197
And so today, I mourn for one son,
Pawnee killer.

337
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:51,206
And I mourn the loss
of my other son, Black Moon...

338
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,091
Which hurts me so much more.

339
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,402
[Men yelling throughout]

340
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,943
That's it boys, almost there!

341
00:30:31,045 --> 00:30:34,583
This is it right here!
This is your marker!

342
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:37,335
We're gonna make it.

343
00:30:37,551 --> 00:30:38,712
Now put your backs into it.

344
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,786
Pick it up, boys!

345
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:51,308
I want them next two rails
laid in the next 5 minutes.

346
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,601
Pick up the pace.

347
00:30:57,813 --> 00:31:01,568
We run out of flanges again,
I'll skin the runner alive!

348
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:04,196
Hold the spike with
it. Hold the spike.

349
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,448
Well, jeez!

350
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:10,202
3, 2, 1.

352
00:31:16,387 --> 00:31:18,043
Break time's over.
Back to work.

353
00:31:18,289 --> 00:31:20,796
Don't bloody look at it, sink!

[Indistinct shouting]

355
00:31:23,194 --> 00:31:25,383
Nail crew, just get 'em nailed in!

356
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:26,968
Clean-up crew, finish it.

357
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,094
1, 2, 3!

358
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,833
That's it.
Back into it.

[Train whistle blows]

360
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,504
Almost there!

361
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,986
You embarrass me now, boys,
and I'll skin the lot of ya.

362
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,490
Let's go!

Hold! Down.

366

Last one, boys!
Last one.

367

Durant:
Mr. Bohannon!

368
00:32:50,608 --> 00:32:51,928
May I?

369
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,273
Ahh.

370
00:33:09,126 --> 00:33:11,281
Ah.
[Crowd cheering]

00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,075
[Laughs]

372
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:24,502
Congratulations.

373

Congratulations.
[Indistinct]

374
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:39,362
Congratulations.

[Cheering and applause]

{pub}Ruth?

377
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,940
I'm sorry.

378
00:34:35,942 --> 00:34:37,701
You were waiting for me?

379
00:34:37,977 --> 00:34:40,278
Every night.

380
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,335
Joseph, are you hurt?

381
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,920
No.

382
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,264
I killed him, Ruth.

383
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,435
[Crying]

384
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,445
I killed my own brother.

[Indistinct chatter]

390
00:36:41,226 --> 00:36:42,668
Excuse me, sir?

391
00:36:42,793 --> 00:36:44,204
Yeah?

392
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:47,664
Oh. Pardon me, ma'am.

393
00:36:47,899 --> 00:36:50,276
What will you be having?

394
00:36:50,401 --> 00:36:53,278
Well, um...
Champagne, perhaps?

395
00:36:53,403 --> 00:36:55,905
Uh... ahem. What?

396
00:36:57,741 --> 00:37:01,094
Um... how about a glass of Sherry?

397
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,955
I love a good Sherry.

398
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,959
Ah. Brandy.

399
00:37:07,084 --> 00:37:08,126
Fine.

400
00:37:08,251 --> 00:37:10,461
Brandy would be fine.

401
00:37:10,586 --> 00:37:12,772
It's on me.

402
00:37:13,923 --> 00:37:15,967
May I?

403
00:37:16,092 --> 00:37:17,759
By all means.

404
00:37:21,764 --> 00:37:23,598
Thank you.

405
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,837
Not good?

406
00:37:32,274 --> 00:37:36,552
Uh... I've had better.

407
00:37:36,677 --> 00:37:38,923
Ahh. Yeah.

408
00:37:41,115 --> 00:37:43,893
Well, you did it.
40 miles.

409
00:37:44,018 --> 00:37:46,306
You said you would, and you did.

410
00:37:46,586 --> 00:37:48,521
First time in my life.

411
00:37:49,523 --> 00:37:50,833
Failed as a tobacco farmer,

412
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:52,668
lost a war...

413
00:37:52,793 --> 00:37:54,469
Now I'm a railroad man.

414
00:37:54,594 --> 00:37:57,692
Maybe third time's the charm, huh?

415
00:37:57,964 --> 00:38:00,695
Maybe.

416
00:38:03,202 --> 00:38:05,241
That first night we met, uh...

417
00:38:05,407 --> 00:38:09,874
You told me I had no idea who you was
or what you was capable of, and...

418
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,087
You was right.

419
00:38:14,212 --> 00:38:16,920
Ha ha.

420
00:38:17,149 --> 00:38:20,660
I thought you were some
spoiled limey brat.

421
00:38:20,785 --> 00:38:21,758
Uh.

422
00:38:21,987 --> 00:38:25,803
Yeah, I guess I got you wrong, huh?

423
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:30,994
Well, what do you think
of me now, Mr. Bohannon?

424
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:43,696
Mrs. Bell!
Mr. Bohannon!

425
00:38:43,862 --> 00:38:45,083
Ahem.

426
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:47,283
Doing a little celebrating?

427
00:38:47,449 --> 00:38:50,021
Well, you both deserve it.

428
00:38:50,146 --> 00:38:53,191
What you did today was historic.

429
00:38:53,316 --> 00:38:54,692
Thank you, Thomas.

430
00:38:54,817 --> 00:38:56,167
Will you join us?

431
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:59,097
I would love to, but, um...

432
00:38:59,222 --> 00:39:01,565
There are a few issues outstanding

433
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,883
that I need to discuss
with my foreman.

434
00:39:08,697 --> 00:39:10,531
Excuse me.

435
00:39:39,326 --> 00:39:40,993
Black Moon.

436
00:39:42,062 --> 00:39:43,638
You in here?

437
00:39:43,763 --> 00:39:45,664
Black Moon?

438
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,045
You made me a pledge.

439
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:56,436
You told me you would win this
war called the Union Pacific.

440
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:58,552
Today, you won a major battle.

441
00:39:58,677 --> 00:40:00,221
You're a man of your word.

442
00:40:00,346 --> 00:40:02,556
Thank you, sir.

443
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:07,238
I wanted to both congratulate
you and offer you a bonus.

444
00:40:07,404 --> 00:40:11,898
Oh. I don't need any more money, sir.

445
00:40:12,023 --> 00:40:15,468
It's not that kind
of bonus, Mr. Bohannon.

446
00:40:15,593 --> 00:40:20,752
It's much more valuable than money.

447
00:40:20,997 --> 00:40:22,837
Information.

448
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:29,427
Oh, you... you're Lieutenant Griggs
from the Calvary.

449
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,013
I heard about you.
Yeah?

450
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:36,620
Well, I heard Black Moon
was livin' in here.

451
00:40:36,745 --> 00:40:39,914
You feel that Joseph led you astray?

452
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:44,984
He needs to be made accountable.

453
00:40:45,221 --> 00:40:49,633
You know, the Swede has been,
shall we say,

454
00:40:49,758 --> 00:40:51,449
focused on you for some time.

455
00:40:51,694 --> 00:40:53,826
Like a hound got the scent.

456
00:40:56,098 --> 00:40:58,808
He just sent a wire

457
00:40:58,933 --> 00:41:02,645
to the federal marshals
in Washington, D.C.

458
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:04,128
Claims he has evidence

459
00:41:04,372 --> 00:41:07,423
linking you to
several murders back east.

460
00:41:10,311 --> 00:41:11,487
You a family man, Lieutenant?

461
00:41:11,612 --> 00:41:15,973
Do you have a wife and children?

462
00:41:16,217 --> 00:41:21,121
I mean, what if...
If someone, uh...

463
00:41:21,728 --> 00:41:25,650
Killed your son and scalped
your daughter and raped your wife?

464
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,819
Would you stand idly by?

465
00:41:29,569 --> 00:41:31,823
They'll be coming to arrest you.

466
00:41:39,172 --> 00:41:42,333
You telling me all this 'cause
you want me to run, Mr. Durant?

467
00:41:44,476 --> 00:41:48,089
I'm giving you a chance
to save yourself, Bohannon.

468
00:42:03,494 --> 00:42:05,271
I don't know, could you... could you...

469
00:42:05,396 --> 00:42:07,400
Find it in your heart to forgive him?

470
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,362
Is he here?

471
00:42:12,935 --> 00:42:14,365
Not now?

472
00:42:16,706 --> 00:42:18,536
Sure, I'll forgive him.

473
00:42:18,775 --> 00:42:21,777
Right after I kill him.

474
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:28,125
We're... we're all held accountable...

475
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,547
You know, one way or another.
