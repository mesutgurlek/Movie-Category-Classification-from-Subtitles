00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:06,033
Hello. I'm James Michener.

2
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:11,608
And those peaks are part
of a majestic mountain range
we call the Rockies.

3
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:15,945
<i>Granite giants that have been</i>
<i>a part of this land forever,</i>

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,213
<i>that symbolize our nation's</i>
<i>strength and freedom.</i>

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,889
I suppose my primary reason
for writing the book
<i>Centennial</i>

6
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,893
was to ask us, you and me,

7
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:32,523
if we're aware of
what's happening right now
to this land we love,

8
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,859
this earth
we depend upon for life.

9
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,364
It's a novel, of course,

10
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:41,703
and its characters
and scenes are imaginary.

11
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,437
<i>But there were French trappers</i>
<i>from Canada,</i>

12
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:47,810
<i>like the man who called</i>
<i>himself Pasquinel.</i>

13
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:53,681
<i>There were mountain men</i>
<i>from Scotland like the man</i>
<i>named Alexander McKeag.</i>

14
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:58,815
<i>There was a silversmith</i>
<i>in St. Louis like</i>
<i>Hermann Bockweiss,</i>

15
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:03,020
<i>an Army officer</i>
<i>like Maxwell Mercy,</i>

16
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:06,395
<i>a militia commander like</i>
<i>Frank Skimmerhorn,</i>

17
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:09,833
<i>a Texas trail boss</i>
<i>like R.J. Poteet,</i>

18
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:15,532
<i>and certain background</i>
<i>incidents and characters</i>
<i>are real.</i>

19
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:18,839
<i>In the 1820s and '30s,</i>
<i>the mountain men did hold</i>

20
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,812
<i>an annual rendezvous</i>
<i>in the Rockies.</i>

21
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:26,579
<i>In 1851, there was</i>
<i>a great convocation</i>
<i>at Fort Laramie</i>

22
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:31,249
<i>that saw 10,000 Indians</i>
<i>gather to approve a treaty</i>
<i>with our government.</i>

23
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,128
<i>In 1864, there was a massacre</i>

24
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:39,927
<i>that is to this day</i>
<i>one of our nation's</i>
<i>greatest tragedies.</i>

25
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:45,968
<i>And the same decade</i>
<i>did see the great longhorn</i>
<i>trail drives north from Texas.</i>

26
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:50,503
<i>The cattle would bring</i>
<i>a need for a town.</i>

27
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,410
<i>A town like the one</i>
<i>I call Centennial.</i>

28
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,008
<i>This is the story</i>
<i>of that town.</i>

29
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,948
It's a big story

30
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:02,579
about the people who helped
make this country what it is,

31
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:05,520
and the land that makes
the people what they are.

32
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,787
And it's a story about time.

33
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:11,456
<i>Not just as a record,</i>
<i>but also a reminder.</i>

34
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:15,228
<i>A reminder that during</i>
<i>the few years allotted</i>
<i>to each of us,</i>

35
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,701
<i>we are the guardians</i>
<i>of the earth.</i>

36
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,964
<i>We are, at once,</i>
<i>the custodians</i>
<i>of our heritage,</i>

37
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,639
<i>and the caretakers</i>
<i>of our future.</i>

38
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:29,005
<i>Stay with us for</i>
<i>the great adventure</i>
<i>of the American West.</i>

39
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,700
<i>NARRATOR: When the Earth</i>
<i>was already ancient,</i>

40
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,970
<i>of an age</i>
<i>incomprehensible to man,</i>

41
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,209
<i>an event of basic importance</i>
<i>occurred in the area</i>

42
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,715
<i>which would later be</i>
<i>known as Colorado.</i>

43
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:16,317
<i>One billion, seven hundred</i>
<i>million years ago,</i>

44
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,758
<i>an irresistible power broke</i>
<i>through the crust of the Earth</i>
<i>to form a basement rock.</i>

45
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,256
<i>That rock would endure</i>
<i>to this very day.</i>

46
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,821
<i>Upon it would be built</i>
<i>the subsequent mountains.</i>

47
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,300
<i>Across it would</i>
<i>wander the rivers.</i>

48
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,572
<i>Brawling, undisciplined,</i>
<i>violent arteries of life</i>

49
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,905
<i>that are part of an endless</i>
<i>cycle of building up</i>
<i>and tearing down,</i>

50
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,971
<i>of stripping away old deposits</i>

51
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,342
<i>and laying down new rock,</i>

52
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,150
<i>using the same material</i>
<i>again and again.</i>

53
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,512
<i>By the year 15,000 B.C.,</i>
<i>the major characteristics</i>

54
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:55,584
<i>of the land around</i>
<i>what was to become Centennial</i>
<i>were fairly well determined.</i>

55
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:00,128
<i>Some miles northwest</i>
<i>was a chalk cliff,</i>

56
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,134
<i>beds of limestone infinitely</i>
<i>older than the Rockies.</i>

57
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:07,405
<i>To the west and slightly</i>
<i>to the south was</i>
<i>a gemlike mountain valley</i>

58
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:11,375
<i>where nuggets of gold had</i>
<i>been raked from the crevices</i>
<i>of the rocks by a glacier</i>

59
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,077
<i>and hidden</i>
<i>at the bottom of a stream.</i>

60
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,672
<i>Another special place</i>
<i>was on the western bank</i>

61
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:20,241
<i>of a wandering, muddy stream</i>
<i>where Centennial was to be.</i>

62
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,153
<i>A small underwater cave that</i>
<i>might never have been found</i>

63
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:27,556
<i>except for a murder</i>
<i>committed over 11,000 years</i>
<i>after its creation.</i>

64
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,658
<i>And finally</i>
<i>there is the river.</i>

65
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,597
<i>A sad, bewildered</i>
<i>nothing of a river,</i>

66
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,063
<i>a sand bottom of</i>
<i>wandering afterthought.</i>

67
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,364
<i>Its name is as flat</i>
<i>as its appearance.</i>

68
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,534
<i>The South Platte.</i>

69
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,771
<i>Yet for a while</i>
<i>it was the highway of empire.</i>

70
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,006
<i>It was the course</i>
<i>of stirring adventure</i>

71
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,709
<i>and the means whereby</i>
<i>the adventurers lived.</i>

72
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,585
<i>And so the stage is set,</i>

73
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,486
<i>the land has become</i>
<i>a home for living things.</i>

74
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,990
<i>One of the most loveable</i>
<i>and stubborn of all creatures</i>

75
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,526
<i>came to thrive</i>
<i>in the streams of Colorado.</i>

76
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:06,691
<i>One of the most deadly</i>
<i>and terrifying took refuge</i>
<i>in its rocky sanctuaries.</i>

77
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,863
<i>The horse returned to</i>
<i>the vast plains that were</i>
<i>its place of origin.</i>

78
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,934
<i>And a version of the bison</i>
<i>trekked from Asia</i>

79
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,907
<i>to roam the area that would</i>
<i>one day be Centennial.</i>

80
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,204
<i>This shaggy beast would</i>
<i>become the center of culture</i>
<i>for the American Indian,</i>

81
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:26,177
<i>a nomadic people</i>
<i>that migrated from Asia</i>
<i>12,000 years ago</i>

82
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,982
<i>and stayed to develop</i>
<i>a primitive social order</i>

83
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,250
<i>and a deep appreciation</i>
<i>of the land.</i>

84
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,621
<i>In the year 1756,</i>

85
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:41,156
<i>a sliver group of a tribe,</i>
<i>who referred to themselves</i>
<i>only as Our People,</i>

86
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,099
<i>faced a major crisis.</i>

87
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,603
<i>The Indians surrounding them</i>
<i>had horses,</i>

88
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:49,664
<i>making them more mobile</i>
<i>in their hunting</i>
<i>and more powerful in war.</i>

89
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,683
<i>War between the various tribes</i>
<i>on the plains was</i>

90
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:02,243
<i>a kind of dangerous game</i>
<i>that seldom resulted in death.</i>

91
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,057
<i>What was important</i>
<i>was a display of courage.</i>

92
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,059
<i>Bravery was shown by</i>
<i>touching or striking an enemy</i>
<i>with hand or weapon,</i>

93
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,890
<i>a practice later to be</i>
<i>known as counting coup.</i>

94
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:17,969
<i>But the bravest act of all</i>

95
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:21,302
<i>was for a warrior</i>
<i>to stake himself out</i>
<i>to face his enemy.</i>

96
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,043
<i>Held to the ground</i>
<i>by bison thongs</i>
<i>and his own pledge</i>

97
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,443
<i>to fight so long as</i>
<i>his strength lasted.</i>

98
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:31,683
<i>Because of its bold disdain</i>
<i>for the enemy,</i>

99
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,618
<i>this act would</i>
<i>almost certainly end</i>
<i>in the warrior's death</i>

100
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,884
<i>and was practiced only under</i>

And if you survive

Wolves that run

and snakes that strike
from me to you

to pump their poison.

This is a man

this is their most
sacred possession.

They believe that the pipe
gives them a communion
with the spirit world.

When they exhale the smoke,
they see it as
a breath of prayer.

Most of them married
and maybe none of them
as strong as that one.

384

At any rate, if I were
a cautious man, I would not
have come to this country.

And if I were not a romantic,
I would not have had
such a lovely daughter.

Why would anyone want
a house larger than this?

And that Pasquinel,

he should take an axe and
chop three or four inches
off her legs.

It is fine to be tall.
If I were tall,
I would rule the world.

But since I'm not,
I am satisfied to rule

three Pawnee.

456
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:02,582
I killed three thieves.

457
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:05,287
And if your braves
attack me now, I kill you.

458
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,425
Two guns.

00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,589
For me?

460
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:13,465
One for the man
who said he was my friend.

461
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:16,163
Which man
speaks to me now?

462

I sorry we fight last year.

463
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,100
This year we be friends.

464
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:32,754

Get the other gun.

465

she's his brother.

at the wrong damn time.

made their eyes believe,
but not their ears, too.

485
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:03,971
Sorry.

486
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:07,039

The brothers speak
different tongues.

487
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:11,713

and the Cheyenne brothers?

488

The Pawnee
and the Arapaho? No.

489

They speak the tongues
of different tribes.

490
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,293
Brothers speak
the same tongue.

491
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,293
He said different tribes
speak different tongues.

492
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:28,361
Since we don't speak
the same tongue,
we cannot be brothers.

493
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:29,769
He lies.

494
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,265
He said...
I speak that much
in any language.

495
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:34,105
No, no.
You're the one who lied

496
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,642
when you told me
I could pass in peace
last year.

497
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:40,182
I carry the arrow
of a coward in my back.

498
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,808
A Pawnee arrow.

499
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,453
Now we are brothers.
This is true.

500
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:48,486
We are brothers like
the Arikara are brothers
to the Pawnee.

501
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:50,458
Different,
but from the same family.

502
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:53,553
Now, I know you didn't
send your braves
to kill me last year.

503
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:56,929
That is why I came back
in friendship as I promised.

504
00:48:57,301 --> 00:49:00,270
And I brought this
to prove my friendship.

505
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:06,037
After we smoke it,
I will teach you
how to shoot a gun.

506
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:09,838
We'll bring you
more guns next year
if you keep your word.

507
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:13,576
I understand about family
like the Arikara and Pawnee.

508
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:17,949
I glad you understand
about last year.

509
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,080
You can travel in Pawnee land.

510
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:24,551
But for every
five pelts you take,
you must give me two.

511
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:25,750
One.

512
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:28,263
Last year you said one.
It is still one.

513
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:32,028
But we will take
your pelts to St. Louis,

514
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:34,434
get more goods
then you can get on the river.
We?

515
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:36,903
Unless you have
a better offer.

516
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,575
Him word good?
Same as you?

517
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,010
Same as me.

518
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:47,739
Maybe I keep him here.
Make sure you come back
from St. Louis.

we come back together.

521
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,626
Because I am Pasquinel.

525
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:17,205
Oh, a year.

526
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,350
Didn't take you long
to get caught.

527
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:21,941
I was about
to escape.

528
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,577
I could see that.

529
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:26,019
Bringing the Indian along
on the leash as a guide,
were you?

530
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:27,579
I would have
gotten away.

531
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:30,788
Then I apologize for
spoiling your plans.

532
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:33,022
No.

533
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:36,298
No. I owe you my thanks
for saying what you did

534
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,766
without kenning
anything about me.

535
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:41,870
And I think
you should ken

536
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,339
I've killed a man.

(LAUGHING)

538
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:24,637
How do you ken
you'll see the men
who took your pelts?

539
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:26,614
They went
to the Mandans.

540
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:28,514
They should return now.

541
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,416
Never without an answer,
are you?

542
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:32,114
Nor you a question.

543
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:35,750
We camp here
three, four days.

544
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:37,088
No more.

PASQUINEL: I hope so.

547
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:50,233
When I told you
what I'd done.

548
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:52,804
And now you want
to tell me again.

549
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:54,969
It is a hard thing
to live with.

550
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:58,109
I've never told
anyone before.

551
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,439

I left the Highlands.

556

Had to leave, actually.

557
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:16,591
You see, he was a laird,
and a tyrant he was,

558
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,657
sinful as the devil himself.

559
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:21,597
He thought because he owned
the land, he owned the people
who worked it, too.

560
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:24,231
He thought he could
do with them whatever
he willed.

561
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,909
Never bothered me
that much, but...

562
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:31,544
My sister.

563
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,612
Well, if you're a wee bit
of a lass like her,

564
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:37,949
a man like that
is a hard thing, I suppose.

565
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,386
She never told me before,
mind you, what...

566
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:45,556
What he'd tried to do to her
when he'd come on her alone
a time or two.

567
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:49,722
When I found him with her,

568
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,399
saw how he was hurting her
and how she was crying...

569
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,037
Well, I just could not
help myself.

570
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:57,130
I had to get him
away from her.

571
00:52:57,207 --> 00:53:00,506
And when he unsheathed
his sword, I lashed out
with my walking stick,

572
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:04,809
a big, knotted thing it was,
and I caught him full force
on the side of the head.

573
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:12,416
And he... He just lay there.

574
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,515
And Meg, she was
crying even harder.

575
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:20,426
Dear God, it was
such an awful sight to see.

576
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:27,335
And then I had to leave

577
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:30,036
because I knew
what would happen
if they found me.

578
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:32,506
Him being a lord and me
just a woodsman's son.

579
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:37,503
I was sorry for doing it,

580
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:41,607
and sorry for having
to leave my home

581
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:45,844
and my family.

582
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,956

I did the right thing.

583

01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:16,667
A whole war party?

938
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:21,072
Nine braves were stealing
peltries from a pirogue
called the <i>Sainte-Geneviève.</i>

939
01:26:22,143 --> 01:26:24,509
The <i>Genevieve.</i> I heard tell
another boat picked her up.

940
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:26,069
All the men
had been massacred.

941
01:26:26,147 --> 01:26:28,980
The Pawnee were
already lifting scalps
when I saw him

942
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:31,314
right in the middle
attacking them all.

943
01:26:31,386 --> 01:26:34,321
I dropped three
from long range
with my rifle,

944
01:26:34,489 --> 01:26:37,049
but he was right in the middle
with just his knife.

945
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:39,823
Hand to hand?

946
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:42,087
By the time I tried to
reload for the fourth,

947
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:43,721
he had killed the last one.

948
01:26:43,798 --> 01:26:47,131
<i>Regardez.</i>
A tomahawk right there.

949
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:51,537
And still he continued
fighting with only one hand.

950
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:55,267
I was wondering
why you partnered up.

951
01:26:55,343 --> 01:26:57,777
I guess that tells
the whole story.

01:47:53,767 --> 01:47:54,859
We can take them.

1244
01:47:55,602 --> 01:47:57,627
We're here for lodge poles,
not scalps.

1245
01:47:58,205 --> 01:48:01,766
Is that the man
who raided the Comanche
for horses talking?

1246
01:48:01,842 --> 01:48:03,309
A man of many coups?

1247
01:48:03,376 --> 01:48:07,176
It is a man who lived
long enough to tell
the stories himself.

1248

We'll wait here
in the shadows
until they leave,

someone to look up to.

But there is nothing
I can teach the Indian

Why is that?

1298

Because he lives
with nature.

1299

He's been taught
to become a part of nature.

I did. But an Indian wouldn't.

1313

He has no clocks
because he sees no need
to schedule his life.

1314
01:51:53,573 --> 01:51:56,303
And he does not believe that
what a man does in a day

01:51:56,376 --> 01:51:58,936
by so many hours
is a real measure
of his worth.

No, no.
He does what he does.

It takes as long as it takes,

better than the Indian.

You may be forgetting
one thing, my son.

They are heathens.

1322

They build no churches,

they write no sacred books,

1324
01:52:25,739 --> 01:52:28,970
but everything about
the Indians centers
around his religion.

1325
01:52:29,042 --> 01:52:30,600
A pagan religion.

1326

It's just I don't suppose
I should be telling others

to tell her first.

He takes a bit of that
from time to time.

1397
01:56:35,588 --> 01:56:39,718
Then we move to the left,
through youth,

1398
01:56:41,227 --> 01:56:43,286
toward the sunset in the west.

1399
01:56:45,031 --> 01:56:49,161
And night falls
as we draw close
to the cold north,

1400
01:56:49,235 --> 01:56:51,135
where the white hairs are.

1401
01:56:51,838 --> 01:56:57,037
To show us that all life is
night and day, good and bad.

1402
01:56:57,910 --> 01:57:00,470
Father, I know.

1403
01:57:01,848 --> 01:57:06,182
If we live on,
we find the source of light
to the east,

1404
01:57:07,387 --> 01:57:11,187
and with it
we find understanding.

1405
01:57:12,291 --> 01:57:18,287
The understanding that
teaches us now to prepare
for the end of life.

1406
01:57:19,132 --> 01:57:23,000
Then we return
to where we began.

1407
01:57:25,171 --> 01:57:27,696
Giving back our life
to all life,

1408
01:57:28,875 --> 01:57:33,175
our flesh to
where it started from.

1409
01:57:33,946 --> 01:57:35,277
Think about this.

1410
01:57:36,783 --> 01:57:42,517
And the more you think
about it, the more meaning
you'll find in it.

1411
01:57:45,058 --> 01:57:46,218

1412
01:58:08,781 --> 01:58:10,578

1413

1414
01:58:13,719 --> 01:58:15,050

1415
01:58:15,955 --> 01:58:18,651
Make certain this old man
keeps working.

1416
01:58:18,891 --> 01:58:20,984
I'm going
to make him a god.

1417
01:58:21,227 --> 01:58:23,991
God Bockweiss, who makes
his silver pipes in heaven

1418
01:58:24,063 --> 01:58:25,997
but only for Pasquinel.

1419
01:58:26,399 --> 01:58:28,060
I will be working.

1420
01:58:31,170 --> 01:58:32,501
Come back.

1421
01:58:32,839 --> 01:58:34,238
I always come back.

<i>Bonjour, mon ami.</i>

1423
01:58:51,357 --> 01:58:53,587
It looks like
a great year for beaver.

1424
01:58:54,327 --> 01:58:56,158
Are you all right?

1425
01:58:57,663 --> 01:59:00,257
I did not think
I would feel this way.

1426
01:59:00,399 --> 01:59:02,867
I think that is natural.

1427
01:59:04,770 --> 01:59:08,365
Especially now,
since you're going
to be a grandfather.

1428
01:59:08,441 --> 01:59:09,874
What? What?

1429
01:59:12,445 --> 01:59:14,072
That's wonderful.

1430
01:59:16,516 --> 01:59:18,484
BOCKWEISS: Does he know?

1431
01:59:19,185 --> 01:59:21,210
I could not tell him.
Lise.

1432
01:59:21,521 --> 01:59:23,011
I want him back.

1433
01:59:23,089 --> 01:59:25,080
He should not be going.

1434
01:59:25,158 --> 01:59:27,251
He will always be going.
Do you not know that, Papa?

1435
01:59:27,326 --> 01:59:28,987
If he has a family...

1436
01:59:29,095 --> 01:59:30,494
He'll always be going.

1437
01:59:30,563 --> 01:59:32,895
That is what he is,
what he does.

1438
01:59:33,533 --> 01:59:35,228
I do not want
to change that.

1439
01:59:36,135 --> 01:59:37,898
I've heard there were others
who have tried.

1440
01:59:37,970 --> 01:59:40,336
Those are unfounded rumors.
They are lies.

1441
01:59:41,007 --> 01:59:42,235
Perhaps.

1442
01:59:42,808 --> 01:59:45,106
All I know is that I love him

1443
01:59:46,078 --> 01:59:48,012
and I want him
to know how much.

1444
01:59:49,849 --> 01:59:52,784
If he comes back and sees
I did not try to stop him,

1445
01:59:52,852 --> 01:59:54,843
I think he will know.

1446
01:59:54,921 --> 01:59:56,582
I want you to know

1447
01:59:57,557 --> 02:00:01,186
I do not understand
that kind of thinking.

1448
02:00:03,262 --> 02:00:07,028
Maybe we only understand
what we want to understand,
huh, Papa?

I used to watch your mother
on mornings like this.

You're even more beautiful
than she was then.

No, this is my work.

why we named you

(CHUCKLING)
Many times.

1458
02:01:29,348 --> 02:01:31,509
We were in the north,
following the bison.

1459
02:01:32,218 --> 02:01:36,245
A Dakota trader
brought out a splendid
basket made by a Cree.

1460
02:01:37,156 --> 02:01:40,922
It looked like it was woven,
but it was made of clay.
And your mother loved it.

1461
02:01:40,993 --> 02:01:42,984
She wanted it
above all other things.

1462
02:01:44,263 --> 02:01:46,356
Father, I know the story.

1463
02:01:46,432 --> 02:01:47,899
You must not forget it.

1464
02:01:48,501 --> 02:01:51,095
You must not forget
that I bought that basket

1465
02:01:51,170 --> 02:01:53,331
for your mother
with a bison robe.

1466
02:01:53,406 --> 02:01:56,204
A robe she'd worked on
for many months
to make it soft.

1467
02:01:56,275 --> 02:01:57,572
It was a good robe,

1468
02:01:57,643 --> 02:01:59,372
and I traded it
for the basket.

1469
02:02:00,279 --> 02:02:03,840
The clay basket
your mother loved so much
and for which you're named.

1470
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:07,311
Father...
And all the other stories,
too.

1471
02:02:07,386 --> 02:02:10,150
The ones your mother
painted on the robe for me,

1472
02:02:10,523 --> 02:02:12,923
the ones we told you
about our life together,

1473
02:02:13,859 --> 02:02:16,657
about the wild duck that
lived in the cottonwoods,

1474
02:02:17,496 --> 02:02:20,226
and the tame elk that stayed
in the camp in the north,

1475
02:02:20,900 --> 02:02:22,527
and all the other stories.

1476
02:02:22,802 --> 02:02:24,997
You must not forget them,
or they will die.

1477
02:02:26,906 --> 02:02:29,101
Father, where's Mother?

1478
02:02:30,142 --> 02:02:31,734
I've looked for her.

1479
02:02:31,811 --> 02:02:33,438
She's gone to be alone.

1480
02:02:35,348 --> 02:02:36,440
Why?

1481
02:02:37,183 --> 02:02:38,445
To think.

1482
02:02:38,718 --> 02:02:40,151
To make herself ready.

1483
02:02:42,521 --> 02:02:43,749
Oh, no.

1484
02:02:45,524 --> 02:02:48,493
That's why you told me
again about the dance, too,
isn't it?

1485
02:02:48,561 --> 02:02:50,119
You are my child.

1486

You must remember
everything,

1487

or your children
will never know
how it was with us.

Let the young men go.

1491
02:03:04,877 --> 02:03:06,970
The young men are
afraid of the Pawnee.

1492
02:03:08,347 --> 02:03:10,110
You can't go.

1493

The girl may be dead.
Why should you die, too?

1494
02:03:12,952 --> 02:03:14,385
We must know.

1495
02:03:14,453 --> 02:03:16,853
And the Pawnee must know
that Our People will not

1496
02:03:16,922 --> 02:03:18,480
let them do
such things to us.

must come for us all.

about the white man Pasquinel.

as well as I know mine.

and no end.

Is he good?

He is all good.

1513
02:04:46,145 --> 02:04:48,375
Then why do we fight
other men?

1514
02:04:49,148 --> 02:04:51,582
Because there is

02:11:07,292 --> 02:11:09,089
so his spirit
won't have to walk.

1555
02:11:11,096 --> 02:11:12,927
The stake and the thongs.

1556
02:11:13,765 --> 02:11:15,198
He died in combat,

1557
02:11:16,635 --> 02:11:18,762
as brave a death
as possible.

1558
02:11:20,639 --> 02:11:22,869
McKEAG: And it just
stays up there like that?

1559
02:11:23,408 --> 02:11:25,376
Nature will claim it
in time.

1560
02:11:26,278 --> 02:11:27,939
As she does everything.

1561
02:11:53,505 --> 02:11:54,733
Mother.

1562
02:12:00,312 --> 02:12:01,506
Mother.

1563
02:12:04,082 --> 02:12:05,174
Mother?

1564
02:12:15,661 --> 02:12:16,855
Mother.

1565
02:12:17,963 --> 02:12:19,897
You don't have to
stay out here.

1566
02:12:21,566 --> 02:12:22,726
It must be.

1567
02:12:22,801 --> 02:12:25,326
There's room on my robe
in your brother's tepee.

1568
02:12:26,004 --> 02:12:29,599
He did not ask me in,
and it's not
your right to ask.

1569
02:12:30,142 --> 02:12:32,167
He won't want you
to stay out here.

1570
02:12:32,244 --> 02:12:34,007
He has no choice.

1571
02:12:34,546 --> 02:12:35,672
I do.

1572
02:12:36,315 --> 02:12:38,545
And I'm staying with you
wherever you are.

1573
02:12:38,984 --> 02:12:40,315
No, sweet one.

1574
02:12:41,053 --> 02:12:43,021
You have a life to live.

1575
02:12:43,388 --> 02:12:45,049
And mine is over.

1576
02:12:46,992 --> 02:12:50,758
He didn't have to
kill himself that way.

1577
02:12:51,897 --> 02:12:54,127
He didn't have to
leave you like this.

1578
02:12:56,868 --> 02:12:58,301
We talked.

1579
02:12:59,972 --> 02:13:01,906
I knew what would come.

1580
02:13:02,774 --> 02:13:04,639
It was this way
for my mother, too.

1581
02:13:04,710 --> 02:13:05,972
But why?

1582
02:13:06,311 --> 02:13:07,938
It makes no sense.

1583
02:13:08,013 --> 02:13:11,380
Does it make more sense
for us to grow old

1584
02:13:12,117 --> 02:13:14,642
and burden those who need
their strength to survive?

1585
02:13:16,888 --> 02:13:18,879
I can't leave you.

1586
02:13:19,291 --> 02:13:20,952
I won't leave you.

1587
02:13:21,126 --> 02:13:24,391
You must stay warm
and you must stay well.

1588
02:13:25,530 --> 02:13:26,929
And when the white man
comes,

1589
02:13:26,999 --> 02:13:29,126
you must go with him
as your father said.

1590
02:13:30,335 --> 02:13:32,599
And you must
have his children,

1591
02:13:33,705 --> 02:13:36,230
and you must remember
all the stories

1592
02:13:37,209 --> 02:13:39,143
so they will know
who they are.

1593
02:13:42,781 --> 02:13:44,772
You remember who you are.

1594
02:13:46,485 --> 02:13:49,477
You are the daughter
of a very brave man.

1595
02:13:51,023 --> 02:13:53,082
A man of many coups.

1596
02:13:54,259 --> 02:13:55,749
He was a fool.

1597
02:13:59,197 --> 02:14:00,926
He was what I said.

1598
02:14:01,867 --> 02:14:06,099
And what you will say
to your children
and they to theirs.

1599
02:14:09,374 --> 02:14:10,807
In that way,

1600
02:14:11,209 --> 02:14:13,177
he will go on living

1601
02:14:13,912 --> 02:14:16,745
and bring meaning
to their lives as well.

1602
02:14:19,418 --> 02:14:21,352
That's all
we can ever do.

1603
02:14:22,821 --> 02:14:24,152
Any of us.

1604
02:14:36,701 --> 02:14:38,225
(SOBBING) Yes, Mother.

1605
02:14:38,303 --> 02:14:39,429
Yes.

1606
02:14:50,048 --> 02:14:51,982
Rude Water dead.

1607
02:14:52,751 --> 02:14:54,116
Dead? How?

1608
02:14:54,920 --> 02:14:56,581
Arapaho make war.

1609
02:14:56,688 --> 02:14:59,213
Big devil Lame Beaver
stake self out,

1610
02:14:59,291 --> 02:15:00,690
shoot Rude Water.

1611
02:15:00,892 --> 02:15:03,360
Lame Beaver?
What happened to him?

1612
02:15:03,762 --> 02:15:04,922
We kill him.

1613
02:15:04,996 --> 02:15:08,659
But his medicine strong.
He count many coup
before he died.

1614
02:15:09,267 --> 02:15:10,825
That scaffold by the river.

1615
02:15:10,902 --> 02:15:12,199
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1616
02:15:12,504 --> 02:15:13,937
(IN ENGLISH)
How long ago this fight?

1617
02:15:14,005 --> 02:15:15,632
Just before snow.

1618
02:15:16,108 --> 02:15:17,370
Not long.

1619
02:15:17,709 --> 02:15:19,267
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1620
02:15:22,547 --> 02:15:24,344
(IN ENGLISH)
We should have
started earlier.

1621
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:27,112
You think you could've
stopped them?
I could've tried.

1622
02:15:27,185 --> 02:15:29,380
You give Lame Beaver gun?

1623
02:15:31,490 --> 02:15:33,219
I trade gun for beaver.

1624
02:15:33,291 --> 02:15:35,020
Same as Rude Water.

1625
02:15:35,193 --> 02:15:37,354
You trade yellow bullets, too?

1626
02:15:37,896 --> 02:15:39,420
Yellow bullets?

1627
02:15:39,598 --> 02:15:43,864
Only reason Lame Beaver
kill Rude Water.

1628
02:15:47,072 --> 02:15:48,232
Well, that looks like...

1629
02:15:49,040 --> 02:15:50,268
It is.

1630
02:15:58,550 --> 02:15:59,915
(IN ARAPAHO) Mother.

1631
02:16:02,888 --> 02:16:04,048
Mother?

1632
02:16:06,992 --> 02:16:08,186
Mother?

1633
02:16:09,294 --> 02:16:10,454
(IN ARAPAHO) Mother?

1634
02:16:10,529 --> 02:16:11,621
(IN ARAPAHO)
Go back.

1635
02:16:12,230 --> 02:16:13,288
Back.

1636
02:17:05,550 --> 02:17:06,778
<i>Bonjour, mon ami.</i>

1637
02:17:06,851 --> 02:17:08,751
Another long night
for you, too, huh?

1638
02:17:12,424 --> 02:17:13,789
Sweet savior.

1639
02:17:16,861 --> 02:17:17,953
Damn.

1640
02:17:30,275 --> 02:17:31,799
It's Blue Leaf.

1641
02:17:33,712 --> 02:17:35,577
How could that happen?

1642
02:17:36,147 --> 02:17:37,546
What's she doing out here?

1643
02:17:37,616 --> 02:17:40,244
She is no longer
the wife of a warrior.

1644
02:17:41,353 --> 02:17:43,787
She has no right
to a tepee of her own.

1645
02:17:44,556 --> 02:17:46,319
What?
It's their law.

1646
02:17:47,125 --> 02:17:49,923
Without a son or a brother
willing to take her in,

1647
02:17:49,995 --> 02:17:51,587
she has no home.

1648
02:17:52,030 --> 02:17:54,658
She is allowed to keep
is what she has on her back.

1649
02:17:54,733 --> 02:17:56,132
That's bloody inhuman!

1650
02:17:56,201 --> 02:17:57,862
She knew
it would happen.

1651
02:17:57,936 --> 02:17:59,460
What about her daughter?

1652
02:18:00,839 --> 02:18:03,637
<i>Oui,</i> the girl,
she would know.

1653
02:18:03,708 --> 02:18:06,006
Know?
About the gold.
Where her father found it.

1654
02:18:06,077 --> 02:18:08,409
That's not what I meant.
I meant what did
they do to her?

1655
02:18:08,480 --> 02:18:12,416
She is young and strong,
she'll bear the grandchildren
of a great warrior.

1656
02:18:13,084 --> 02:18:14,813
She'll have plenty of men
after her.

1657
02:18:14,886 --> 02:18:16,877
She could even have
a husband already.

1658
02:18:23,228 --> 02:18:24,855
What should we do with her?

1659
02:18:25,530 --> 02:18:26,690
Leave her.

1660
02:18:27,265 --> 02:18:30,166
They will lay her to rest with
her sewing kit and awl cases

1661
02:18:30,235 --> 02:18:32,294
like they did him
with the weapons.

1662
02:18:33,104 --> 02:18:35,231
Let's find the girl.
What's her name?

1663
02:18:35,940 --> 02:18:38,408
Clay Basket.
<i>Oui,</i> Clay Basket.

1664
02:18:51,256 --> 02:18:53,281
She is with my father now.

1665
02:18:55,560 --> 02:18:56,925
It is good.

1666
02:19:00,532 --> 02:19:01,726
And you?

1667
02:19:03,234 --> 02:19:04,861
You're all right?

1668
02:19:07,339 --> 02:19:08,465
Aye.

1669
02:19:08,973 --> 02:19:10,406
Clay Basket,

1670
02:19:10,642 --> 02:19:12,837
I gave your father
the gun.

1671
02:19:13,478 --> 02:19:15,002
Do you know
where he got
his bullets?

1672
02:19:15,080 --> 02:19:16,411
Pasquinel.

1673
02:19:16,715 --> 02:19:17,943
Ask her.

1674
02:19:20,051 --> 02:19:23,578
(IN ARAPAHO) Do you know
where your father got
the bullets for his gun?

1675
02:19:25,657 --> 02:19:27,022
(IN ARAPAHO) Bullets?

1676
02:19:27,325 --> 02:19:28,314
Aye.

1677
02:19:28,393 --> 02:19:30,156
Where? Ask her where.

1678
02:19:30,895 --> 02:19:32,055
(IN ENGLISH) I make.

1679
02:19:33,465 --> 02:19:34,955
You? You made the bullets?

1680
02:19:36,468 --> 02:19:37,492
(IN ARAPAHO) Bullets.

1681
02:19:37,569 --> 02:19:39,332
(IN ENGLISH)
Aye. I make bullets.

1682
02:19:39,404 --> 02:19:40,530
The yellow ones?

1683
02:19:41,072 --> 02:19:42,835
Yellow?
Like these.

1684
02:19:47,345 --> 02:19:49,575
No.
But they came
from the gun.

1685
02:19:50,248 --> 02:19:51,977
My father's gun?
<i>Oui.</i>

1686
02:19:52,050 --> 02:19:54,712
They came
from your father's gun.
Where did he get them?

1687
02:19:55,987 --> 02:19:57,215
I not see.

1688
02:19:58,289 --> 02:20:01,156
I not know.
But he say to me...

1689
02:20:01,226 --> 02:20:02,659
<i>Oui?</i> He said?

1690
02:20:04,796 --> 02:20:08,027
(SPEAKING ARAPAHO)

1691
02:20:08,733 --> 02:20:10,325
He just told her
how much it meant to him

1692
02:20:10,402 --> 02:20:12,131
and to the tribe for you
to give him the gun.

1693
02:20:12,203 --> 02:20:13,568
That's all?

1694
02:20:14,839 --> 02:20:16,500
(IN ARAPAHO)
That's all
he said to you?

1695
02:20:17,675 --> 02:20:19,643
He told me
you would come back.

1696
02:20:20,311 --> 02:20:22,006
(IN ENGLISH)
He told her we'd come back.

1697
02:20:25,383 --> 02:20:28,375
And when you did,
he wanted me to go with you,
if it pleases you, Pasquinel.

1698
02:20:28,453 --> 02:20:29,613
What?

1699
02:20:32,023 --> 02:20:36,016
He told me it would
make him proud if I would
belong to Pasquinel.

1700
02:20:38,563 --> 02:20:40,053
What did she say?

1701
02:20:44,068 --> 02:20:45,262
McKeag?

1702
02:20:48,573 --> 02:20:51,337
He told her
he wanted her
to go with you.

1703
02:20:52,544 --> 02:20:53,806
<i>Avec moi?</i>

1704
02:20:54,345 --> 02:20:55,778
To be your wife.

1705
02:20:57,248 --> 02:20:59,239
Pasquinel, I wonder...

1706
02:20:59,751 --> 02:21:01,184
I mean,
since you're already...

1707
02:21:01,252 --> 02:21:02,583
I mean,
since there's no way...

1708
02:21:02,654 --> 02:21:05,248
<i>Mon ami,</i> I don't think
you understood what she said.

1709
02:21:05,323 --> 02:21:07,723
Her father told her
to go with me.

1710
02:21:08,059 --> 02:21:10,653
He know I would
take care of her.
I heard.

1711
02:21:10,728 --> 02:21:13,629
But Bockweiss
asked you first...
Bockweiss is in St. Louis.

1712
02:21:13,698 --> 02:21:15,325
What about Lise?

1713
02:21:15,867 --> 02:21:18,859
He'll take care of her.
He will always
take care of her.

1714
02:21:24,042 --> 02:21:26,840
Tell her I am proud
to have her for my wife.

1715
02:21:26,911 --> 02:21:28,776
For the gold,
you mean.

1716
02:21:29,080 --> 02:21:31,275
That's it, isn't it?
The gold.

1717
02:21:31,749 --> 02:21:33,717
You think she knows
where it is.

1718
02:21:39,524 --> 02:21:40,786
Tell her.

1719
02:21:53,004 --> 02:21:55,404
(IN ARAPAHO) Pasquinel,
he doesn't want me?

1720
02:21:58,843 --> 02:22:02,335
Pasquinel says
you make him proud.

1721
02:22:08,786 --> 02:22:10,219
Red Beard?

1722
02:22:10,288 --> 02:22:11,380
Aye?

1723
02:22:12,724 --> 02:22:15,192
(IN ENGLISH)
Arm good?

1724
02:22:20,131 --> 02:22:21,928
Aye. My arm is fine.

1725
02:22:36,114 --> 02:22:37,945
<i>NARRATOR: The Indians said,</i>

1726
02:22:38,016 --> 02:22:40,712
<i>"Pasquinel,</i>
<i>he can be trusted. "

1727
02:22:41,886 --> 02:22:45,117
<i>It came to be</i>
<i>a passport of safety for</i>
<i>the</i> coureur de bois

1728
02:22:45,189 --> 02:22:46,918
<i>and his partner</i>
<i>Alexander McKeag.</i>

1729
02:22:48,259 --> 02:22:52,218
<i>But McKeag began to wonder</i>
<i>how much the Indians had</i>

1730
02:22:52,997 --> 02:22:55,158
<i>Had they confused</i>

1731
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:57,524
<i>Still, the young Scot</i>
<i>could not leave</i>

1732
02:22:57,602 --> 02:22:59,729

1733

1734
02:23:02,874 --> 02:23:05,308
<i>He only knew</i>
<i>one thing for certain.</i>

1735
02:23:05,743 --> 02:23:07,404
<i>It would be a hard winter.</i>
