1
00:01:46,327 --> 00:01:47,594
one of the most thrilling

2
00:01:47,595 --> 00:01:50,496
and surely one of the most
dangerous rodeo events--

3
00:01:50,497 --> 00:01:53,365
cowboys riding
the wild brahma bulls.

4
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:56,569
unlike the bucking horse
used in rodeos

5
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,438
who will try to prevent

6
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,672
stepping on
or kicking a rider,

7
00:01:59,673 --> 00:02:02,141
the brahma bull will
purposely stomp a contestant

8
00:02:02,142 --> 00:02:03,409
with his sharp hoofs

9
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,310
or rip the rider
with his horns,

10
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:08,247
oftentimes causing
fatal injuries.

11
00:02:08,248 --> 00:02:09,916
the brahma bulls
you see here

12
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:12,084
are well-known for
their mean dispositions

13
00:02:12,085 --> 00:02:13,552
and are particularly
treacherous

14
00:02:13,553 --> 00:02:15,421
because they're
the only type bull

15
00:02:15,422 --> 00:02:17,957
that will charge a man
with their eyes open.

16
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,159
that's why you'll
never see a brahma bull

17
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,928
in the ring
with a matador.

18
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:26,131
the first bull rider today,
one of the all-time greats,

19
00:02:27,534 --> 00:02:29,900
Jeff McCloud, Bandera, Texas.

20
00:02:30,703 --> 00:02:33,772
Jeff's coming out
on a bull called razor,

21
00:02:33,773 --> 00:02:36,107
'cause he's given
a lot of cowboys

22
00:02:36,108 --> 00:02:37,308
a close shave.

23
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:40,610
contestants ride the bull
holding onto a loose rope,

24
00:02:40,913 --> 00:02:42,380
sometimes
called a bullrope,

25
00:02:42,381 --> 00:02:44,149
the other hand
free in the air.

26
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,385
should the cowboy touch
the bull with his free hand

27
00:02:47,386 --> 00:02:49,053
anytime during
his eight-second ride,

28
00:02:49,054 --> 00:02:50,421
he will be disqualified.

29
00:02:50,422 --> 00:02:53,390
keep your eyes
on chute number 1.

30
00:02:56,061 --> 00:02:58,495
take him out!

31
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:30,059
thanks to the alertness
of our rodeo clowns.

32
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,294
he may be
shaken up a bit,

33
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,430
but he's walked away from
tougher spills than this.

34
00:03:35,765 --> 00:03:38,634
now take a look
over at chute number 2.

35
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,536
shorty west
from blackton, idaho,

36
00:03:41,904 --> 00:03:44,639
on a bull
called round trip.

37
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:50,244
shorty must have bought
a one-way ticket.

38
00:07:43,102 --> 00:07:45,136
all right,
you under there,

39
00:07:45,137 --> 00:07:47,872
back out
nice and slow.

40
00:07:53,613 --> 00:07:56,781
what are you doing
crawling around under my house?

41
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,150
I didn't think
nobody lived here.

42
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:00,351
somebody lives here.

43
00:08:00,352 --> 00:08:03,287
what are you doing
crawling under there?

44
00:08:03,355 --> 00:08:06,156
I was looking for something
I thought I'd lost.

45
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:10,126
I used to save my money
in this tobacco can

46
00:08:10,263 --> 00:08:12,897
when I was a kid
and my folks lived here.

47
00:08:12,898 --> 00:08:15,899
with my 2 nickels
in it after 20 years.

48
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:18,935
2 nickels was a load
of money to me then.

49
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:22,172
you connie mccloud's boy?

50
00:08:22,173 --> 00:08:23,740
I'm Jeff mccloud.

51
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:26,276
I'm jeremiah watrus.

52
00:08:26,577 --> 00:08:28,378
howdy.

53
00:08:29,447 --> 00:08:32,281
there's some coffee
in the house.

54
00:08:32,684 --> 00:08:35,218
come on in and sit.

55
00:08:37,788 --> 00:08:41,388
- did you know my old man?
- not personal.

56
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:43,660
well, the place
ain't changed much.

57
00:08:43,661 --> 00:08:45,795
I bought it
at a tax auction.

58
00:08:45,796 --> 00:08:48,031
got it at my own price.

59
00:08:48,032 --> 00:08:50,499
now I know why.

60
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,070
could have had more fun throwing my money
out the window.

61
00:08:56,973 --> 00:08:59,941
it ain't changed much
in here, either.

62
00:09:00,143 --> 00:09:04,244
- wash up if you've a mind to.
- I washed this morning.

63
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:19,128
I was born
in this room.

64
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:21,429
that ain't much
to brag about.

65
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,997
where you from
these days?

66
00:09:22,998 --> 00:09:25,633
oh, I move around a lot.

67
00:09:30,939 --> 00:09:32,707
I can't get over it.

68
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,575
in 20 years,
you'd think it'd change.

69
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:37,378
some things
never do.

70
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:38,880
but there's
been changes.

71
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:40,748
sun's got
a little hotter,

72
00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:43,450
a little more
earth's blowed away,

73
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:44,851
a little less water.

74
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:48,953
that's about all the changes.
what made you come back?

75
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:50,891
I don't know.

76
00:09:50,892 --> 00:09:53,126
I always thought someday
I'd make enough money

77
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:56,928
to settle down
on the old place, run a few head.

78
00:09:56,732 --> 00:09:59,266
- you got the money?
- I had it...once.

79
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,868
- what happened?
- I got kind of sidetracked.

80
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:04,137
women?

81
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:06,939
no. no, women
don't sidetrack me.

82
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,840
something else.

83
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,942
I'll be 62 come march.

84
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,977
maybe if I was married,
I might fix the place,

85
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,848
or if I had kids.

86
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,550
it is kind of lonely.

87
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:20,484
I like a place
that's lonely, private.

88
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,122
you been married?

89
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,991
I figure it this way...

90
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,993
marriage, it's lonely,
but it ain't private.

91
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,996
you got
anything you own?

92
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,201
what I started out with,

93
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:37,968
a strong back
and a weak mind.

94
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,138
a shack,
some rocky ground,

95
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,508
a spavined horse,
and a busted windmill...

96
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,244
that's all I got.

97
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,213
that's still
more than me.

98
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,815
yeah, but
you ain't 62 yet.

99
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,383
you a thinking man?

100
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:55,019
oh, I can get in
out of the rain,

101
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,919
that's about all.

102
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,955
me, I'm a thinking man.
this is what I think.

103
00:10:59,023 --> 00:11:00,725
one of the things
that's wrong

104
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:03,461
is that all the books
and rules on success

105
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,630
is written
by successful men.

106
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,163
that's wrong. fellas like you and me'd
get a lot more help

107
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:13,336
if those books was written by failures.
that would make sense.

108
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,309
that cowhand from
the jackhammer ranch,

109
00:11:20,745 --> 00:11:22,347
him and his wife
play games.

110
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,113
is that bad?

111
00:11:24,114 --> 00:11:26,215
reckon today they'll
want to remodel this kitchen.

112
00:11:26,216 --> 00:11:29,451
about the only thing
around here they ain't fixed over.

113
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:30,521
in their mind's eye,
of course.

114
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:32,922
do it regular
every sunday...

115
00:11:32,923 --> 00:11:34,791
come prowling around
with calf eyes,

116
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:37,526
saying
how much they'd like to buy the place.

117
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:40,096
you don't need
no urging to sell, do you?

118
00:11:40,097 --> 00:11:41,563
moon talk.

119
00:11:41,564 --> 00:11:44,499
where's a ranch hand
going to get $5,000?

120
00:11:44,768 --> 00:11:46,169
well, I'll be
getting on.

121
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,704
figure to make
abilene by sundown.

122
00:11:48,705 --> 00:11:50,639
set still.

123
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,441
sometimes they're
right amusing.

124
00:11:54,243 --> 00:11:56,645
no. I better
hit the road.

125
00:11:56,646 --> 00:11:58,146
kind of disappointing,
I guess.

126
00:11:58,147 --> 00:12:00,282
man coming back
to his home place,

127
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:01,549
find it like this.

128
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,019
kind of like
visiting a graveyard.

129
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,687
yeah, something
like that.

130
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:07,355
well, good luck.

131
00:12:15,464 --> 00:12:17,632
I hope we didn't
interrupt nothing.

132
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:18,499
fella
was born here.

133
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,735
wanted to see
how the place looked after 20-odd years.

134
00:12:22,204 --> 00:12:25,205
scared us. thought
maybe he was a buyer.

135
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,807
him?

136
00:12:25,808 --> 00:12:28,542
them mcclouds
is the most shiftless family

137
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,944
ever hit
these parts.

138
00:12:29,945 --> 00:12:31,212
he couldn't
buy nothing.

139
00:12:31,213 --> 00:12:32,946
mccloud!
that's who that is!

140
00:12:32,947 --> 00:12:33,980
Jeff mccloud!

141
00:12:33,981 --> 00:12:35,182
<i>you know him?</i>

142
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:37,251
leave him alone, Wes.

143
00:12:37,252 --> 00:12:39,152
he's the world
saddle bronc champ,

144
00:12:39,153 --> 00:12:41,054
the first man ever
to ride zombie.

145
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:04,577
I was at
the cheyenne rodeo

146
00:13:04,578 --> 00:13:06,545
the year you won
the all-around.

147
00:13:06,546 --> 00:13:08,914
how big is this ranch
you ride for?

148
00:13:08,915 --> 00:13:10,015
oh, big enough.

149
00:13:10,016 --> 00:13:12,084
that's the year you
rode zombie, right?

150
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:14,052
think they can
use another hand?

151
00:13:14,053 --> 00:13:15,855
I'm sure rig
will take you on.

152
00:13:15,856 --> 00:13:18,923
I wouldn't get my hopes up
too high, mr. mccloud.

153
00:13:18,992 --> 00:13:19,491
why not?

154
00:13:19,492 --> 00:13:20,725
lots of foremen
on the big spreads

155
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:23,061
won't give
rodeo cowboys jobs.

156
00:13:23,062 --> 00:13:25,130
figures they're
all saddle tramps.

157
00:13:25,131 --> 00:13:26,531
don't they have
rodeos around here?

158
00:13:26,532 --> 00:13:29,501
I ride
in one every year at the county fair.

159
00:13:29,502 --> 00:13:31,403
won $40 last year.

160
00:13:31,404 --> 00:13:33,872
$40? must be a big show.

161
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:36,540
40 or 100, I don't
like to see him rodeo.

162
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,409
you know,
the year I was champ,

163
00:13:39,544 --> 00:13:42,078
I won over $25,000.

164
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:46,249
easy come, easy go.

165
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:14,043
I'll take Jeff
over to see rig.

166
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:17,046
you think
you can roust up another lamb chop?

167
00:14:17,047 --> 00:14:18,113
I think so.

168
00:14:18,114 --> 00:14:19,816
we usually eat early
on sunday,

169
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,284
but can you hold out
until 5:00, 5:30?

170
00:14:22,285 --> 00:14:25,086
for lamb chops?
sure, I can.

171
00:15:01,923 --> 00:15:04,057
we'll have a lab report
in the morning, rig.

172
00:15:04,058 --> 00:15:06,294
in the meantime,
keep the calf in quarantine

173
00:15:06,295 --> 00:15:08,629
until we find out
about this.

174
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,098
put him in that
middle stall, boys.

175
00:15:14,903 --> 00:15:17,670
picked this fella up
at jeremiah's place.

176
00:15:17,671 --> 00:15:19,272
he's hunting for a job.

177
00:15:19,273 --> 00:15:20,540
name's
Jeff mccloud.

178
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,775
what outfit did you
work for last,

179
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:24,011
and why'd you quit?

180
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:26,179
I been rodeoing
the last few years.

181
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,748
had a brahma bull
set on me.

182
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:31,450
sorry.
I can't use you.

183
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:36,321
look, if you're thinking
I'm a rodeo tramp, you got me wrong.

184
00:15:36,624 --> 00:15:38,557
I've hired rodeo
cowboys before.

185
00:15:38,558 --> 00:15:41,693
they're always practicing their tricks
and roughing up the stock.

186
00:15:42,229 --> 00:15:45,396
when you need them most,
they're taking off for fort worth or cheyenne.

187
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:48,500
if you want
some recommendations, I can get them for you.

188
00:15:49,169 --> 00:15:50,369
what ranches
you work for?

189
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,371
I worked the lazy w
and vern jackson's place

190
00:15:53,773 --> 00:15:54,907
up in the panhandle.

191
00:15:54,908 --> 00:15:57,676
managers of both places
will vouch for me.

192
00:15:57,677 --> 00:15:59,277
how are you
with horses?

193
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:01,546
can you break colts
without making broncs out of them?

194
00:16:01,515 --> 00:16:03,449
I got a special calling
for horses,

195
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:06,351
like some get the call
to be a preacher.

196
00:16:06,352 --> 00:16:09,320
I can make them
do anything but talk mexican.

197
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:12,423
one of my best cowboys
is sick with arthritis.

198
00:16:12,724 --> 00:16:14,459
what'll you work for?

199
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,227
oh, 140.

200
00:16:16,228 --> 00:16:18,729
120's the best
I can do.

201
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,064
you got yourself a hand.

202
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:22,500
I might
as well tell you

203
00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:25,469
we got
some strict rules on this place.

204
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,971
we don't
run our cattle

205
00:16:26,972 --> 00:16:28,839
'cause it
takes the fat off.

206
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,607
we don't rope them
unless we have to.

207
00:16:30,608 --> 00:16:34,543
we got good blooded stuff here.
we can't sell them with broken legs.

208
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,681
I'll show you
the bunkhouse.

209
00:16:40,485 --> 00:16:42,319
I'll meet you
at the corral

210
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,321
and help you
pick out a string of ponies.

211
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,201
hey, Jeff, you've
been around a lot.

212
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:01,570
you figure
your old place

213
00:17:01,571 --> 00:17:02,938
is worth $5,000?

214
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,675
I'm a bad one to ask
about money matters.

215
00:17:05,676 --> 00:17:07,643
the only way
I could tell

216
00:17:07,644 --> 00:17:09,645
how much a thing
was worth

217
00:17:09,646 --> 00:17:11,614
was by how bad
I wanted it.

218
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,516
this is a nice
little layout.

219
00:17:13,517 --> 00:17:16,350
what did you have to do
to get it?

220
00:17:16,386 --> 00:17:17,052
get married.

221
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:19,121
louise and me
waited six months

222
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:21,223
until a married
cowboy quit.

223
00:17:21,224 --> 00:17:22,324
we got $1,100 saved up.

224
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:25,260
we're going to buy
jeremiah's place and stock it.

225
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:26,728
call it the w-l,
right?

226
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:27,996
that's
the general idea.

227
00:17:27,997 --> 00:17:29,531
as soon as we
get the money.

228
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:32,633
$1,100 is pretty good
for 2 years of marriage.

229
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:35,269
yeah. who
does the saving?

230
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,505
oh, she's
the banker.

231
00:17:36,506 --> 00:17:38,573
I just hand her
my pay.

232
00:17:38,574 --> 00:17:39,774
ain't it surprising

233
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:42,576
how romantic women
can get about money?

234
00:17:42,777 --> 00:17:44,178
Wes tells me

235
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:47,114
you once made $3,000
in one day rodeoing.

236
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,185
and threw it all away.

237
00:17:51,186 --> 00:17:54,254
I didn't throw it away.
it just sort of floated.

238
00:17:54,822 --> 00:17:57,558
that's pretty stupid...
breaking all your bones,

239
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,693
then letting
the money go.

240
00:17:59,694 --> 00:18:02,694
some things you don't do
for the cash, there is in it.

241
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,831
some things you
do for the buzz.

242
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,734
one minute
on a crazy horse.

243
00:18:07,735 --> 00:18:10,937
a minute? 10 seconds
can make it feel like a lifetime.

244
00:18:11,605 --> 00:18:13,606
and wind up
with a snapped neck.

245
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:14,774
or a dislocated
collarbone

246
00:18:14,775 --> 00:18:17,710
or have your brains
shook loose by a bronc.

247
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:22,180
I've come
out of those chutes a lot of times,

248
00:18:22,716 --> 00:18:24,884
heard the crowd
hollering,

249
00:18:24,885 --> 00:18:26,252
a horse or a bull

250
00:18:26,253 --> 00:18:28,755
jumping and twisting
underneath you.

251
00:18:28,756 --> 00:18:31,589
I always felt
the same thing.

252
00:18:32,058 --> 00:18:33,558
for a little bit,
you're a lot more

253
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:36,195
than you are
just walking down the street

254
00:18:36,196 --> 00:18:37,696
or eating
or sleeping.

255
00:18:37,697 --> 00:18:38,863
maybe it's something

256
00:18:38,864 --> 00:18:41,366
you can't
explain to a woman.

257
00:18:42,234 --> 00:18:44,770
'cause it's a different
kind of buzz.

258
00:18:44,771 --> 00:18:47,172
thanks again
for the supper.

259
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:48,540
it's been a long time

260
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,441
since I had a supper
that good.

261
00:18:50,442 --> 00:18:51,743
that's one of the reasons

262
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:54,678
they were standing in line
to marry her.

263
00:19:11,162 --> 00:19:13,030
I guess
a lot of people ask

264
00:19:13,031 --> 00:19:15,265
what's the best horse
you ever rode.

265
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:16,934
yeah,
a lot of people.

266
00:19:16,935 --> 00:19:18,068
was it zombie?

267
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:20,137
I draw two-step
one time

268
00:19:20,138 --> 00:19:21,305
and got bucked off.

269
00:19:21,306 --> 00:19:24,240
she was good, but I
mark zombie better.

270
00:19:25,643 --> 00:19:27,277
was you ever scared?

271
00:19:27,278 --> 00:19:28,278
rodeoing?

272
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:30,846
yeah, of getting hurt.

273
00:19:30,881 --> 00:19:32,382
well, I've been scared,

274
00:19:32,383 --> 00:19:34,651
and I've been not scared.

275
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:35,785
why did you quit?

276
00:19:35,786 --> 00:19:38,754
well, I busted the last
three ribs I had.

277
00:19:39,156 --> 00:19:42,290
I still wouldn't have quit
if I hadn't caved in.

278
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,694
you been rodeoing
a long time.

279
00:19:45,695 --> 00:19:46,996
yeah, 18 years.

280
00:19:46,997 --> 00:19:49,732
won the national
when I was 17.

281
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:52,867
I started
cutting wild horses when I was 13.

282
00:19:53,237 --> 00:19:54,537
I wasn't but 14.

283
00:19:54,338 --> 00:19:56,972
they paid me
10 cents a head.

284
00:19:56,973 --> 00:19:57,739
that's what I got.

285
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,941
a fella's bankroll
could get fat in a hurry rodeoing.

286
00:20:02,745 --> 00:20:04,880
chicken today,
feathers tomorrow.

287
00:20:04,881 --> 00:20:07,382
not if he
played it smart

288
00:20:07,383 --> 00:20:09,184
when he
had the chicken.

289
00:20:09,185 --> 00:20:11,486
you stay with those
lamp chops, man.

290
00:20:11,487 --> 00:20:12,921
she cooks them good.

291
00:20:12,922 --> 00:20:14,356
I hate to mention this,

292
00:20:14,357 --> 00:20:16,024
but you're a working man.

293
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:17,392
you are, too, now.

294
00:20:17,393 --> 00:20:18,993
about time
to hit the sack.

295
00:20:18,994 --> 00:20:19,861
we just ate.

296
00:20:19,862 --> 00:20:22,063
we ate late.
4:30 comes early.

297
00:20:22,064 --> 00:20:23,064
4:30?

298
00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:26,033
I forgot people
get up at 4:30.

299
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:27,267
well, good night.

300
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:28,102
good night.

301
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:29,671
sure enjoyed
that supper.

302
00:20:46,354 --> 00:20:48,955
chow time!
come and get it!

303
00:22:05,697 --> 00:22:08,131
you got a lot
of horse in chico.

304
00:22:08,132 --> 00:22:10,566
yeah. working
off of him's no work.

305
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:13,535
came out of king ranch
quarter horse stock.

306
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:16,006
raised him from a colt.

307
00:22:16,007 --> 00:22:17,274
know any better?

308
00:22:17,275 --> 00:22:19,509
oh, I used to
a long time ago.

309
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,611
horse like him's
worth $2,000-3,000.

310
00:22:21,612 --> 00:22:22,679
you could sell him

311
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,482
and help pay for
that ranch you want.

312
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:27,983
aim to have both.

313
00:22:30,421 --> 00:22:33,021
show you something else.

314
00:22:39,496 --> 00:22:40,796
"calf roping, $50.

315
00:22:40,797 --> 00:22:42,031
bareback, 25.
bronc riding"...

316
00:22:42,032 --> 00:22:45,067
your wife know
about you spending all this money

317
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:46,168
on the rodeo?

318
00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:48,304
I'll tell her
if I make out all right

319
00:22:48,305 --> 00:22:50,339
next month at san angelo.

320
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,140
you couldn't win
hamburger money

321
00:22:52,141 --> 00:22:53,642
against
top professionals.

322
00:22:53,643 --> 00:22:56,110
not right away.
I know that.

323
00:22:56,111 --> 00:22:57,579
but I learn fast.

324
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,081
you're a pretty
sharp article.

325
00:23:00,082 --> 00:23:01,682
you are for a fact.

326
00:23:01,683 --> 00:23:04,718
you've had one thing in
the back of your mind.

327
00:23:05,054 --> 00:23:07,488
I don't figure I've
done anything wrong.

328
00:23:07,489 --> 00:23:09,657
I thought if I
could get you hired,

329
00:23:09,658 --> 00:23:11,292
maybe you'd help me some.

330
00:23:11,293 --> 00:23:12,826
at the rate louise
and me are going,

331
00:23:12,827 --> 00:23:15,962
it'll take us 15 more years
to get jeremiah's place.

332
00:23:16,498 --> 00:23:19,266
my wife's got more
patience than I have.

333
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:22,401
don't figure we'll ever
own a place of our own,

334
00:23:22,904 --> 00:23:25,239
less'n we find
some shortcut.

335
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,873
I know what I want,

336
00:23:26,874 --> 00:23:29,742
and it won't
take no 15 years.

337
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:18,755
you take $125 out
of the bank last week?

338
00:24:20,925 --> 00:24:22,759
that's right. I...

339
00:24:24,195 --> 00:24:25,763
forgot to mention it.

340
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:28,832
well, I sort of been trying
to get around to it.

341
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:33,170
what was it for?

342
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,905
oh, I sent it
to san angelo.

343
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,711
entry fees in the rodeo.

344
00:24:44,782 --> 00:24:46,916
that's something else
you forgot to mention.

345
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:49,918
oh, I was going to
tell you when it was over.

346
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:52,122
I wanted to surprise you.

347
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:55,290
surprise me with
what...a broken leg, a broken neck?

348
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,426
look, I'm good.

349
00:24:57,427 --> 00:24:59,395
Jeff knows.
he's been teaching me.

350
00:24:59,396 --> 00:25:01,564
Jeff mccloud,
that great has-been.

351
00:25:01,565 --> 00:25:02,765
what's rig
going to think

352
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:05,401
about one of his hands
taking a vacation?

353
00:25:05,402 --> 00:25:07,103
he knows I'm going
to san angelo.

354
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:10,272
if he hears you've
been in a rodeo, he'll fire you.

355
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:13,441
the minute it looks like
a guy's losing his job,

356
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:15,210
his wife gets panicky.

357
00:25:15,211 --> 00:25:18,147
that's why I didn't
tell you about the money.

358
00:25:18,148 --> 00:25:19,882
look, buster, nobody's
getting panicky.

359
00:25:19,883 --> 00:25:22,750
I'm just trying
to keep us straight.

360
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:25,921
and stop
kidding yourself.

361
00:25:25,922 --> 00:25:26,721
you ain't the only guy

362
00:25:26,722 --> 00:25:29,524
who tried to take me
from behind that counter

363
00:25:29,525 --> 00:25:31,593
and set me up
in business.

364
00:25:31,594 --> 00:25:33,062
you ain't the biggest,

365
00:25:33,063 --> 00:25:34,596
you ain't the strongest,

366
00:25:34,597 --> 00:25:35,997
you ain't the richest,

367
00:25:35,998 --> 00:25:38,066
and you ain't
the prettiest,

368
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:39,534
but you're the only one

369
00:25:39,535 --> 00:25:41,102
who wanted
what I wanted...

370
00:25:41,103 --> 00:25:42,871
a decent steady life.

371
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:51,178
I love you more than
anything in the world,

372
00:25:51,446 --> 00:25:53,114
but I want
to get my place.

373
00:25:53,115 --> 00:25:56,183
I want to toss a rope
over my own cow just once.

374
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,053
you're a grown man, Wes.

375
00:26:00,054 --> 00:26:02,289
you do what you like.

376
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,691
I aim to.

377
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:07,860
I'm going to san angelo.

378
00:26:28,515 --> 00:26:29,916
"joe burgess,
petey mendoza,

379
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:32,485
jim barney,
red logan, jack nemo."

380
00:26:32,486 --> 00:26:34,220
that's a pretty
good lineup.

381
00:26:34,221 --> 00:26:37,255
hey, you draw high voltage
in the saddle bronc.

382
00:26:37,657 --> 00:26:38,690
I know that horse.

383
00:26:38,691 --> 00:26:41,759
"bald eagle, blackout,
raw deal, billy the kid."

384
00:26:42,528 --> 00:26:43,929
that's al dawson's stock.

385
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,564
ain't that
al dawson's stock?

386
00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:48,500
something wrong
with the stock?

387
00:26:48,501 --> 00:26:51,602
no. I just never knew him
to work this far south.

388
00:26:52,372 --> 00:26:53,639
I know your horse,
though.

389
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,807
I won the day money
on him at st. joe and denver.

390
00:27:00,947 --> 00:27:02,147
hey, nemo!

391
00:27:02,148 --> 00:27:03,381
well, what do you know?

392
00:27:03,382 --> 00:27:04,115
who's the dude?

393
00:27:04,116 --> 00:27:06,784
what are you,
a lightning rod salesman?

394
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:09,887
hear you been
dirt farming lately.

395
00:27:09,888 --> 00:27:10,655
pretty near.

396
00:27:10,656 --> 00:27:13,158
Wes Merritt,
meet red logan and jack nemo.

397
00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:16,593
didn't see your name
on the entry list.

398
00:27:16,828 --> 00:27:17,762
I'm just here
with Wes.

399
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:20,097
Wes getting
his feet wet today.

400
00:27:39,817 --> 00:27:42,318
welcome to san angelo's
annual rodeo.

401
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:45,387
starting this great
western celebration,

402
00:27:46,023 --> 00:27:47,056
we proudly present

403
00:27:47,057 --> 00:27:50,325
our very colorful grand
entry of riders and horses

404
00:27:50,494 --> 00:27:53,161
in the serpentine ride.

405
00:28:34,102 --> 00:28:36,270
next will be
saddle bronc riding.

406
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:39,206
our first rider this
afternoon is slim avery,

407
00:28:39,207 --> 00:28:41,941
who hails
from reno, nevada.

408
00:28:54,389 --> 00:28:56,423
I'd like to call
your attention

409
00:28:56,424 --> 00:28:57,891
to the two men
on horseback.

410
00:28:57,892 --> 00:28:59,059
they are our pickup men

411
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,127
who, immediately
after the whistle sounds,

412
00:29:01,128 --> 00:29:02,595
take the rider
off the bucking horse

413
00:29:02,596 --> 00:29:04,764
and transfer him safely
to the ground.

414
00:29:04,765 --> 00:29:07,733
we draw your attention
to chute number 1,

415
00:29:07,835 --> 00:29:10,103
where Wes Merritt
of big springs, texas,

416
00:29:10,104 --> 00:29:11,837
is coming out
on high voltage.

417
00:29:11,838 --> 00:29:14,607
I can't tell you much
about Wes Merritt, folks.

418
00:29:14,608 --> 00:29:17,009
he's a newcomer
to the circuit.

419
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,144
an old friend of ours,
Jeff mccloud,

420
00:29:19,145 --> 00:29:20,513
is traveling
with Wes Merritt,

421
00:29:20,514 --> 00:29:22,948
teaching him the tricks
of the trade.

422
00:29:22,949 --> 00:29:26,050
so let's watch
this boy Merritt closely.

423
00:29:26,753 --> 00:29:29,121
that's too much rein.

424
00:29:29,122 --> 00:29:31,223
shut up, will you?
hey, red.

425
00:29:31,224 --> 00:29:33,458
what are we
hung on here?

426
00:29:34,293 --> 00:29:36,595
pass Wes Merritt!

427
00:29:36,596 --> 00:29:39,197
we move along now
to Pete mendoza

428
00:29:39,198 --> 00:29:40,998
from santa fe,
new mexico,

429
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:43,735
who's riding a horse
called april fool

430
00:29:43,736 --> 00:29:46,337
out of chute number 18.

431
00:29:48,173 --> 00:29:51,074
he's giving him
a ride, folks!

432
00:29:56,115 --> 00:29:58,515
now, like I said,
right here.

433
00:30:01,153 --> 00:30:03,754
forget about the crowd
now. just relax.

434
00:30:03,755 --> 00:30:06,189
don't fight him.
work with him.

435
00:30:07,426 --> 00:30:10,192
it's like dancing
with a girl,

436
00:30:10,194 --> 00:30:11,795
only you let him lead.

437
00:30:11,796 --> 00:30:14,030
we move now
to chute number 1...

438
00:30:14,031 --> 00:30:16,199
Wes Merritt coming out
on high voltage.

439
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,768
ok, let me have him!

440
00:30:17,769 --> 00:30:20,335
get after him,
Wes!

441
00:30:26,277 --> 00:30:28,843
stay with him,
Wes!

442
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,215
good timing.

443
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:36,084
you know, he can
rope a little, too.

444
00:30:42,492 --> 00:30:45,593
this boy will be a familiar
face on the circuit

445
00:30:45,862 --> 00:30:47,062
from now on.

446
00:30:47,063 --> 00:30:47,762
I rode him!

447
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:51,032
you might have
rode him right into some day money, too.

448
00:31:05,147 --> 00:31:07,482
next on our program
is calf roping,

449
00:31:07,483 --> 00:31:09,017
an event against time.

450
00:31:09,018 --> 00:31:10,784
Wes Merritt
of big springs, texas,

451
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,853
who you just saw make
a fine saddle bronc ride,

452
00:31:14,323 --> 00:31:17,290
is going to try his skill
in calf roping.

453
00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:41,448
Wes Merritt's time
is 14.2...

454
00:31:41,982 --> 00:31:44,883
which is good time
in any man's rodeo.

455
00:31:44,885 --> 00:31:46,085
our next calf roper

456
00:31:45,886 --> 00:31:48,821
is craig dunlap
of logan, utah.

457
00:32:04,704 --> 00:32:06,039
sing hallelujah,
honey!

458
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,006
I won two day moneys!

459
00:32:07,007 --> 00:32:10,408
I could have gone
for the average, too, but I got bucked off.

460
00:32:11,077 --> 00:32:12,378
did you get hurt?

461
00:32:12,379 --> 00:32:14,179
no, I bounced.
smell it, honey.

462
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,715
don't it smell sweeter
than all the roses?

463
00:32:16,716 --> 00:32:19,384
$410. that's more
than 2 months' wages.

464
00:32:19,385 --> 00:32:21,319
and I made it
in two minutes.

465
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,388
there's more where
that come from.

466
00:32:23,389 --> 00:32:25,623
as long as you
didn't get hurt.

467
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:28,658
I wasn't even scratched.
I told you, I bounced.

468
00:32:30,196 --> 00:32:33,064
I told rig we're
moving out tomorrow.

469
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,033
moving out?

470
00:32:36,968 --> 00:32:39,503
I'm going to rodeo.

471
00:32:40,573 --> 00:32:43,306
let me get this
straight.

472
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:44,775
you quit?

473
00:32:44,776 --> 00:32:45,577
we're leaving
here?

474
00:32:45,578 --> 00:32:47,879
Jeff and me figured it
out on the way back.

475
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,781
everything he knows
about rodeoing, he'll teach me.

476
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:52,249
he'll help us
get someplace.

477
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,386
how did mr. mccloud
become an expert on getting someplace?

478
00:32:55,387 --> 00:32:58,588
he took the same
shortcut you're planning to take.

479
00:32:58,623 --> 00:33:01,258
where did he wind up
18 years later?

480
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:03,327
you got him
all wrong, honey.

481
00:33:03,328 --> 00:33:05,261
he's doing me
a big favor.

482
00:33:05,262 --> 00:33:06,863
we'll split
the money we win.

483
00:33:06,864 --> 00:33:08,297
what's he
going to win?

484
00:33:08,298 --> 00:33:10,433
split what you
win, you mean.

485
00:33:10,434 --> 00:33:11,701
big-hearted
mccloud.

486
00:33:11,702 --> 00:33:14,336
if he could still ride,
would he share it with you?

487
00:33:14,406 --> 00:33:16,639
that ain't the point.

488
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,342
$400 for 2 minutes'
work, that's the...

489
00:33:19,343 --> 00:33:22,511
if it was that easy,
every rodeo hand would be rich.

490
00:33:23,379 --> 00:33:24,412
I want that ranch.

491
00:33:24,413 --> 00:33:28,515
so do I, but what
good's the ranch going to be if you're crippled?

492
00:33:29,585 --> 00:33:32,453
you got to have
as much guts as me.

493
00:33:32,488 --> 00:33:34,923
how much money
can we save on what I make?

494
00:33:34,924 --> 00:33:37,959
I'll be bent over double
before we save $5,000.

495
00:33:38,027 --> 00:33:40,362
my old man
spent his whole life

496
00:33:40,363 --> 00:33:41,629
working for somebody else.

497
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:45,565
all he left behind was a big grocery bill
and a worn-out saddle.

498
00:33:46,402 --> 00:33:47,469
well, that ain't for me.

499
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:50,504
I know what I want,
and I know how to get it.

500
00:33:51,607 --> 00:33:54,075
Jeff mccloud's
our big chance to do it!

501
00:33:54,076 --> 00:33:57,243
you think mccloud's
a pretty great guy, don't you?

502
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:29,441
I want you to do
something for me.

503
00:34:29,877 --> 00:34:31,210
if I can, sure.

504
00:34:31,211 --> 00:34:34,346
get this rodeoing
idea out of my husband's head.

505
00:34:34,415 --> 00:34:36,482
well, that's
a pretty large order.

506
00:34:36,483 --> 00:34:38,984
you put the idea
into his head,

507
00:34:38,985 --> 00:34:40,720
you can get it out.

508
00:34:40,721 --> 00:34:41,220
can I?

509
00:34:40,821 --> 00:34:43,855
that 400 bucks he won
really touched him off.

510
00:34:43,924 --> 00:34:46,858
he thinks he can do
that good every day.

511
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,795
you know he can't.
you know he was lucky.

512
00:34:50,163 --> 00:34:52,864
he's got his mind
made up.

513
00:34:54,501 --> 00:34:57,003
we've been doing good,
real good.

514
00:34:57,004 --> 00:34:59,538
don't let him
throw it all away.

515
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:00,705
he'll listen to you.

516
00:35:00,706 --> 00:35:03,674
look, this rodeoing's
his idea, not mine.

517
00:35:04,677 --> 00:35:05,911
then don't
go with him.

518
00:35:05,912 --> 00:35:07,846
if you don't go,
he won't go.

519
00:35:07,847 --> 00:35:10,415
he's only trying to get
something he wants.

520
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:13,250
I want it, too,
but not that way,

521
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:15,186
not rodeoing.

522
00:35:15,187 --> 00:35:17,322
how else is a cowhand
going to get it?

523
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:20,557
the only way a cowhand
can make real dough is rodeoing.

524
00:35:21,193 --> 00:35:24,161
Wes is good. he'll make
a potful of money.

525
00:35:25,797 --> 00:35:27,131
of which
you'll take half.

526
00:35:27,132 --> 00:35:30,133
it'll still
leave him more than he'll make here

527
00:35:30,134 --> 00:35:31,836
if he works all his life.

528
00:35:31,837 --> 00:35:34,771
I just want to see
one guy in this world

529
00:35:35,173 --> 00:35:36,774
get what he wants,
that's all.

530
00:35:36,775 --> 00:35:40,076
a pretty good deal
for you, wasn't it, latching on to Wes?

531
00:35:44,615 --> 00:35:47,016
latching on?

532
00:35:48,319 --> 00:35:51,320
they tell me Wes found you
in a tamale joint.

533
00:35:54,492 --> 00:35:57,860
they tell me anything's
better than working in a tamale joint,

534
00:35:58,963 --> 00:36:01,396
even marriage.

535
00:36:04,068 --> 00:36:06,969
I'm going to explain
something to you.

536
00:36:07,237 --> 00:36:09,972
my folks
were fruit pickers.

537
00:36:10,574 --> 00:36:11,940
my pa was a drifter.

538
00:36:11,941 --> 00:36:14,110
I grew up
in tents and camps.

539
00:36:14,111 --> 00:36:17,278
I never knew what
a pair of silk stockings was like

540
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,615
until I was 19.

541
00:36:19,616 --> 00:36:21,016
we never had
a house.

542
00:36:21,017 --> 00:36:22,951
got so
I was always jealous

543
00:36:22,952 --> 00:36:25,087
of people
who lived in houses

544
00:36:25,088 --> 00:36:26,555
and stayed
in one place

545
00:36:26,556 --> 00:36:27,856
and had somebody
to love.

546
00:36:27,857 --> 00:36:30,725
that's all I could
ever think about.

547
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,261
I picked Wes out
to marry,

548
00:36:33,262 --> 00:36:35,730
and I picked him
real slow

549
00:36:35,731 --> 00:36:37,198
and real careful.

550
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:38,466
and I didn't
pick him

551
00:36:38,467 --> 00:36:40,568
for the wild horses
he could ride

552
00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:42,937
or gold belt buckles
he might win.

553
00:36:42,938 --> 00:36:46,006
but if he
still wants to go in the morning,

554
00:36:46,274 --> 00:36:47,675
I'm going with him,

555
00:36:47,676 --> 00:36:49,143
because
there's one thing

556
00:36:49,144 --> 00:36:51,211
I'm not going
to let you do,

557
00:36:51,212 --> 00:36:54,447
and that's turn him
into a saddle tramp like yourself.

558
00:37:04,992 --> 00:37:07,393
redheads...

559
00:37:07,795 --> 00:37:09,663
what gives a guy
the idea

560
00:37:09,664 --> 00:37:12,465
that redheads
are any different?

561
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:15,968
all they got
is bad tempers.

562
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,115
Wes?

563
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:37,156
like I said,

564
00:37:37,157 --> 00:37:40,224
as soon as we
get the ranch money together,

565
00:37:40,727 --> 00:37:41,661
I quit.

566
00:37:41,662 --> 00:37:43,028
is it a deal?

567
00:37:43,029 --> 00:37:45,429
it's a deal.

568
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:29,471
well, what are
we waiting for?

569
00:39:49,284 --> 00:39:51,750
come on, chico.

570
00:40:06,433 --> 00:40:09,167
the barns
are over that way.

571
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,121
and 20.

572
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:30,322
10 more.

573
00:40:30,323 --> 00:40:32,790
let's go ahead.

574
00:40:52,344 --> 00:40:53,277
10 bucks.

575
00:40:53,278 --> 00:40:54,746
that's a bet.

576
00:40:54,747 --> 00:40:56,446
10 more for me.

577
00:40:59,617 --> 00:41:01,585
craps.

578
00:41:01,586 --> 00:41:02,920
that cleans me out.

579
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:05,688
how about loaning me
50 bucks?

580
00:41:06,691 --> 00:41:07,791
sorry. not today,
burgess.

581
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:10,959
what's the matter,
you scared you won't get it back?

582
00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:13,930
gracie said nobody
should loan you no more money.

583
00:41:13,931 --> 00:41:16,700
who you shooting craps
with, me or my wife?

584
00:41:16,701 --> 00:41:18,201
I got to get
some shut-eye.

585
00:41:18,202 --> 00:41:19,636
I'm roping
this afternoon.

586
00:41:19,637 --> 00:41:22,404
one thing I hate
is a tightwad.

587
00:41:22,907 --> 00:41:25,340
I'm quitting.

588
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,448
that's the last thing
you're about to do.

589
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:38,454
I'll cut that money
loose!

590
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:39,722
hey, hey,
take it easy.

591
00:41:39,723 --> 00:41:42,824
hey, you're
kicking up a lot of dust, cowboy.

592
00:41:42,926 --> 00:41:45,027
today just ain't
your lucky day.

593
00:41:45,028 --> 00:41:47,729
you try the dice
tomorrow.

594
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:52,067
it ain't the dice.

595
00:41:52,068 --> 00:41:55,169
thanks. he's been hitting
the bottle pretty hard.

596
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,306
a man shouldn't
shoot crap

597
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:58,740
if he can't
stand to lose.

598
00:41:58,741 --> 00:42:01,842
ain't that. he got gored
with a brahma in cheyenne.

599
00:42:03,879 --> 00:42:06,680
a horn caught him
in the cheek.

600
00:42:06,749 --> 00:42:09,683
I wasn't going to use it
unless I had to.

601
00:42:10,185 --> 00:42:13,186
think I'll lay down
a while before the show.

602
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,989
you're mccloud,
ain't you?

603
00:42:15,925 --> 00:42:17,558
glad to see you.

604
00:42:18,593 --> 00:42:20,061
well,
come on, Wes.

605
00:42:20,062 --> 00:42:21,895
we better
grain chico.

606
00:42:21,896 --> 00:42:22,696
you hungry?

607
00:42:22,697 --> 00:42:25,399
no. that's a terrible
scar he had.

608
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,100
yeah. brahmas
are pretty spooky.

609
00:42:27,101 --> 00:42:30,136
a bronco will shake you
loose and then leave you,

610
00:42:30,137 --> 00:42:32,773
but a bull will keep
right after you.

611
00:42:32,774 --> 00:42:35,642
they're mean,
keep on getting meaner,

612
00:42:35,643 --> 00:42:37,010
but the bulls that fight,

613
00:42:37,011 --> 00:42:38,678
that's what
people pay to see.

614
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:41,848
a cup of coffee
and a half-pound of raw hamburger!

615
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:45,185
coffee don't
float a hammer, I ain't drinking it!

616
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,120
rusty!

617
00:42:48,121 --> 00:42:50,022
either you're
getting heavier,

618
00:42:50,023 --> 00:42:51,123
or I'm getting weaker.

619
00:42:51,124 --> 00:42:54,158
once on the other side,
like in the good book.

620
00:42:54,762 --> 00:42:57,829
figured they ground you up
for dog food long ago.

621
00:42:58,298 --> 00:43:01,165
no. the dogs took
one bite and quit.

622
00:43:01,201 --> 00:43:01,968
hiya, book.

623
00:43:01,969 --> 00:43:04,103
I knowed you couldn't
stay away.

624
00:43:04,104 --> 00:43:07,171
he says in cheyenne,
"that's all. I'm washed up."

625
00:43:07,407 --> 00:43:09,708
this old crow bait's
going to be washed up

626
00:43:09,709 --> 00:43:11,676
when he's holding flowers
on that fancy shirt

627
00:43:11,677 --> 00:43:14,513
and the rodeo band's
playing soft and sweet.

628
00:43:14,514 --> 00:43:15,847
my name's booker davis.

629
00:43:15,848 --> 00:43:18,149
this here filly here
is my daughter rusty.

630
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:21,019
hello, rusty.
I'm Wes Merritt, Jeff's partner.

631
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,755
partner? man,
sew up your pockets.

632
00:43:23,756 --> 00:43:26,589
you're new, ain't you?
got 2 bits?

633
00:43:28,527 --> 00:43:31,194
ok, let him
have a look.

634
00:43:33,765 --> 00:43:36,699
you ever see anything
like that before?

635
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:41,339
sure is
the worst-looking leg I've ever seen.

636
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,574
20 years rodeoing
done that.

637
00:43:43,575 --> 00:43:44,742
leg busted nine times,

638
00:43:44,743 --> 00:43:47,311
kneecap, five,
and the ankle, four.

639
00:43:47,312 --> 00:43:50,413
booker's got
the most busted leg in the world.

640
00:43:50,548 --> 00:43:51,515
nobody'll ever beat it,

641
00:43:51,516 --> 00:43:53,951
'less they jump off
a new york skyscraper.

642
00:43:53,952 --> 00:43:55,385
last time
booker broke it,

643
00:43:55,386 --> 00:43:57,554
doctors wanted
to cut it off.

644
00:43:57,555 --> 00:43:59,056
it was up in denver.

645
00:43:59,057 --> 00:44:00,457
he got
some crutches

646
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:02,058
and headed
for new mexico.

647
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:05,160
a big blizzard come up.
had to pull into a motel.

648
00:44:05,996 --> 00:44:07,730
had no sooner got in bed

649
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:10,199
than my leg started
hurting pretty bad.

650
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,168
finally, I pushed my bed
over to the window

651
00:44:13,537 --> 00:44:14,636
and stuck my leg out.

652
00:44:14,637 --> 00:44:17,672
soon the leg froze up,
and the pain went away.

653
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:20,009
next morning,
I thawed it out

654
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:21,944
and drove on
to santa fe.

655
00:44:21,945 --> 00:44:24,080
I won four firsts
that day.

656
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:26,449
get the griddle hot.
put some coffee on.

657
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:29,184
we got to feed
these fellers.

658
00:44:30,687 --> 00:44:33,855
old book used to be
one of the best bronc riders.

659
00:44:34,724 --> 00:44:36,391
what happened?

660
00:44:36,392 --> 00:44:39,227
punchy. bronc shook
his brains loose.

661
00:44:39,228 --> 00:44:42,063
he's head wrangler
for dawson now.

662
00:44:53,642 --> 00:44:54,342
who pulled in?

663
00:44:54,343 --> 00:44:57,544
I don't know, but
they've been through a lot of mud.

664
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,747
sure have.

665
00:45:05,553 --> 00:45:06,988
nice-looking filly.

666
00:45:06,989 --> 00:45:09,655
yeah. well
quartered up.

667
00:45:10,225 --> 00:45:11,725
looks fast.

668
00:45:11,726 --> 00:45:13,594
depends on the track.

669
00:45:13,595 --> 00:45:16,362
it depends on
the jockey, too.

670
00:45:22,202 --> 00:45:24,570
get lost.

671
00:45:24,606 --> 00:45:25,438
howdy.

672
00:45:25,439 --> 00:45:27,907
morning, ma'am.

673
00:45:53,299 --> 00:45:55,100
is there
a ladies' room around?

674
00:45:55,101 --> 00:45:58,202
honey, there ain't
no ladies' room around here.

675
00:45:59,372 --> 00:46:01,773
in fact, there
ain't no ladies.

676
00:46:01,774 --> 00:46:04,708
if you want
to wash up, right there.

677
00:46:05,077 --> 00:46:06,744
all the comforts.

678
00:46:08,013 --> 00:46:09,914
how much did you lose?

679
00:46:09,915 --> 00:46:11,583
ain't none
of your business.

680
00:46:11,584 --> 00:46:14,317
last time out,
you won $45

681
00:46:14,553 --> 00:46:17,055
and lost 52 that night
playing poker.

682
00:46:17,056 --> 00:46:20,123
now look at you...
drunk, dirty, and scared.

683
00:46:21,093 --> 00:46:23,360
scared?
scared of what?

684
00:46:23,361 --> 00:46:24,628
nothing.

685
00:46:24,629 --> 00:46:27,464
don't you ever
tell me I'm scared.

686
00:46:31,269 --> 00:46:33,303
come on back
to the trailer

687
00:46:33,304 --> 00:46:35,938
and get me
some coffee.

688
00:46:53,691 --> 00:46:55,758
your husband
going to rodeo?

689
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,261
bull riding?

690
00:47:00,097 --> 00:47:03,131
well, don't let him.
don't let him ever start.

691
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,467
if he rides one,
he'll keep on riding.

692
00:47:06,536 --> 00:47:07,569
the day will come

693
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:09,671
when a bull will
stomp and gore him.

694
00:47:09,672 --> 00:47:12,673
then he'll have to
show he ain't scared,

695
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:14,610
but he is.

696
00:47:14,611 --> 00:47:16,678
he'll start drinking
to hide it...

697
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:18,647
a pint of whiskey,
two pints,

698
00:47:18,648 --> 00:47:20,649
play cards, craps,
anything...

699
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:22,584
to hide how
frightened he is.

700
00:47:22,585 --> 00:47:25,053
every time you hear
that loudspeaker

701
00:47:25,054 --> 00:47:26,454
announcing
they're coming out,

702
00:47:26,455 --> 00:47:29,590
you know
he's going to be there drunk and scared.

703
00:47:30,492 --> 00:47:33,360
your heart
will stop inside you.

704
00:47:34,897 --> 00:47:36,264
so don't let him.

705
00:47:44,406 --> 00:47:45,906
you just get in?

706
00:47:45,907 --> 00:47:46,940
yeah. drove all night.

707
00:47:46,941 --> 00:47:49,909
husband's bedding down
his horse, I guess.

708
00:47:58,686 --> 00:48:01,921
this spigot's
closest I've been to water for 24 hours.

709
00:48:02,523 --> 00:48:05,558
come to my trailer.
have a hot cup of coffee.

710
00:48:05,593 --> 00:48:08,494
I'm rosemary maddox.
I do trick riding.

711
00:48:09,597 --> 00:48:10,463
louise Merritt.

712
00:48:10,464 --> 00:48:13,265
coffee sounds
like a good idea.

713
00:48:15,302 --> 00:48:18,503
Merritt...don't think
I know any rider named Merritt.

714
00:48:19,206 --> 00:48:20,873
this is
our first time up.

715
00:48:20,874 --> 00:48:23,076
oh. know any
rodeo people?

716
00:48:23,077 --> 00:48:24,710
just one...
Jeff mccloud.

717
00:48:24,711 --> 00:48:27,579
mccloud? you don't
look like somebody

718
00:48:27,914 --> 00:48:29,381
who'd know
Jeff mccloud.

719
00:48:29,382 --> 00:48:30,882
thanks for
the compliment.

720
00:48:30,883 --> 00:48:32,218
he's my husband's
partner.

721
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:33,852
we're traveling
together.

722
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:38,757
hey, is this yours?

723
00:48:38,758 --> 00:48:41,492
the man said so
when he signed the receipt.

724
00:48:41,493 --> 00:48:43,994
do you like it?

725
00:48:46,032 --> 00:48:47,498
looks like a hotel.

726
00:48:47,499 --> 00:48:49,934
it is a hotel.

727
00:48:51,837 --> 00:48:53,571
where'd you
pick up Jeff?

728
00:48:53,572 --> 00:48:56,640
texas. only
you might say he picked us up.

729
00:48:57,243 --> 00:48:58,643
married long?

730
00:48:58,644 --> 00:48:59,744
two years.

731
00:48:59,745 --> 00:49:01,011
recommend it?

732
00:49:01,012 --> 00:49:03,147
it's what
I always wanted.

733
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:06,149
don't you get
bored stiff keeping house?

734
00:49:06,417 --> 00:49:09,085
no. I like
keeping house.

735
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:12,623
cooking's all right,
if you got to cook.

736
00:49:12,624 --> 00:49:15,658
me, I like
fried shrimp somebody else fried.

737
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:18,462
the shower's
working... real hot water.

738
00:49:18,463 --> 00:49:20,197
have one while
the coffee perks.

739
00:49:20,198 --> 00:49:22,132
thanks a lot.
I sure could use one.

740
00:49:22,133 --> 00:49:25,167
there's a robe
hanging up there somewhere.

741
00:49:26,871 --> 00:49:28,238
do you like Jeff?

742
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:31,073
no more than
any other sidewinder.

743
00:49:32,109 --> 00:49:34,576
anybody up?

744
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:37,546
I didn't know
you had company.

745
00:49:37,547 --> 00:49:40,282
louise Merritt,
ginny logan.

746
00:49:41,118 --> 00:49:44,219
hi. you drove in
with Jeff mccloud, didn't you?

747
00:49:44,621 --> 00:49:47,455
he's darling,
isn't he, rosemary?

748
00:49:48,124 --> 00:49:51,259
red thinks the sun
rises and sets on Jeff mccloud.

749
00:49:52,028 --> 00:49:53,028
red's my husband.

750
00:49:53,029 --> 00:49:55,797
he's the craziest
man I know.

751
00:49:57,667 --> 00:49:58,367
my husband.

752
00:49:58,368 --> 00:50:00,903
ain't he
the craziest man you ever met?

753
00:50:00,904 --> 00:50:03,671
I wanted something,
but what?

754
00:50:04,607 --> 00:50:05,374
sugar.

755
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:06,974
sugar?
ain't it crazy

756
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:09,611
the way
I forget things?

757
00:50:09,612 --> 00:50:12,713
are you going
to sit with us in the grandstand?

758
00:50:13,649 --> 00:50:15,817
us wives always
sit together.

759
00:50:15,818 --> 00:50:16,918
I suppose so.

760
00:50:16,919 --> 00:50:19,787
why, when red's
on a bull or bronc,

761
00:50:19,922 --> 00:50:22,156
I get so excited,
I scream.

762
00:50:22,157 --> 00:50:24,590
I just scream.

763
00:50:26,661 --> 00:50:29,662
I'm three trailers down
toward the stables.

764
00:50:30,299 --> 00:50:33,033
uh, just follow
the horses.

765
00:50:33,034 --> 00:50:35,601
well, see y'all later.

766
00:50:37,406 --> 00:50:40,139
Jeff ever make
a pass at you?

767
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:45,510
don't get mad, honey.
I only asked.

768
00:50:47,114 --> 00:50:48,348
you're pretty.

769
00:50:48,349 --> 00:50:51,084
that's enough
to make him try.

770
00:50:51,085 --> 00:50:52,219
for three years,

771
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:55,120
all Jeff mccloud
had to do was whistle,

772
00:50:55,989 --> 00:50:57,990
and I'd come running.

773
00:50:57,991 --> 00:50:59,192
what happened?

774
00:50:59,193 --> 00:51:02,193
he stopped whistling,
and I stopped running.

775
00:51:03,731 --> 00:51:06,131
well, make yourself
at home.

776
00:51:06,132 --> 00:51:07,633
I'll be back.

777
00:51:07,634 --> 00:51:10,068
thanks a lot.

778
00:51:29,756 --> 00:51:32,457
if you're looking
for rosemary, she's gone out.

779
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:34,926
I wasn't looking
for rosemary.

780
00:51:34,927 --> 00:51:37,228
I was looking
for al dawson.

781
00:51:37,229 --> 00:51:39,597
he's the stock contractor
on this show.

782
00:51:39,598 --> 00:51:42,665
booker tells me he takes
his morning coffee here.

783
00:51:43,969 --> 00:51:46,703
must be
an expensive brand.

784
00:51:47,339 --> 00:51:49,307
maybe it works
in reverse.

785
00:51:49,308 --> 00:51:51,976
how do you want it,
hot or cold?

786
00:51:51,977 --> 00:51:54,378
as long
as it's clean.

787
00:51:54,379 --> 00:51:57,113
hot this way,
cold that way.

788
00:51:57,282 --> 00:51:59,717
anytime your plumbing
don't work,

789
00:51:59,718 --> 00:52:02,052
just call mccloud.

790
00:52:02,053 --> 00:52:03,487
is Wes all right?

791
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:06,957
he's over at booker's,
resting.

792
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:08,625
got a big day
coming up.

793
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,627
hey, you're real little
with your shoes off.

794
00:52:11,729 --> 00:52:14,597
you're real little
with your shoes on.

795
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:15,598
rosemary's tall.

796
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:16,699
she's
more your type.

797
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,635
rosemary's nice,
but little's nice, too.

798
00:52:20,905 --> 00:52:23,238
outside.

799
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,608
hasta luego.

800
00:52:30,713 --> 00:52:31,547
that's spanish for

801
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:34,482
"if the shower don't work,
call mccloud."

802
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:46,728
you need any help?

803
00:52:46,729 --> 00:52:48,430
this ain't
the first time

804
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:49,865
I've been away
from home.

805
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:52,300
I haven't been
run over yet.

806
00:52:52,301 --> 00:52:54,902
well, if you need me,
I'm here.

807
00:52:54,903 --> 00:52:57,338
I'll whistle.

808
00:53:44,784 --> 00:53:47,219
good morning.

809
00:53:48,155 --> 00:53:50,323
well, good morning.

810
00:53:50,324 --> 00:53:51,324
howdy, al.

811
00:53:51,325 --> 00:53:52,157
hi, Jeff.

812
00:53:52,158 --> 00:53:53,626
what you doing here?

813
00:53:53,627 --> 00:53:55,728
oh, just having
a little coffee.

814
00:53:55,729 --> 00:53:57,195
thought you
quit rodeoing.

815
00:53:57,196 --> 00:54:00,031
no. I changed my mind.
coffee, al?

816
00:54:00,634 --> 00:54:03,101
no. I had mine.

817
00:54:09,009 --> 00:54:10,308
I understand, uh,

818
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:13,111
rosemary's
trick riding with you.

819
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,081
I plan to follow
your circuit myself this season, al.

820
00:54:21,521 --> 00:54:23,121
I'm hazing
for Wes Merritt.

821
00:54:23,122 --> 00:54:26,123
oh, yeah. he rode for me
down in san angelo.

822
00:54:26,892 --> 00:54:28,559
I'll need a horse.

823
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,861
I'll sell you one.

824
00:54:29,862 --> 00:54:32,395
who's in the shower?

825
00:54:33,932 --> 00:54:35,099
lady.

826
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,833
mccloud!

827
00:54:36,834 --> 00:54:38,235
yeah?

828
00:54:38,236 --> 00:54:39,670
throw me a towel.

829
00:54:39,671 --> 00:54:42,071
I'll get it.

830
00:54:43,508 --> 00:54:45,941
over there.

831
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:05,260
what on...
hey! hey!

832
00:55:06,497 --> 00:55:09,030
that ain't rosemary!

833
00:55:09,265 --> 00:55:11,866
no, that ain't rosemary.

834
00:55:28,218 --> 00:55:30,385
not a good horse
in the bunch.

835
00:55:30,386 --> 00:55:32,354
they wouldn't
do to cut a steer.

836
00:55:32,355 --> 00:55:33,689
that's what I mean.

837
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:35,757
bunch of hammerheads
and stiff-legs,

838
00:55:35,758 --> 00:55:37,959
but they pay off
with a crowd.

839
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,628
how about
these brahmas?

840
00:55:42,832 --> 00:55:43,865
they're monsters.

841
00:55:43,866 --> 00:55:46,399
they sure look mean.

842
00:55:59,681 --> 00:56:01,849
how about
something to eat?

843
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:02,950
I ain't hungry.

844
00:56:02,951 --> 00:56:05,985
no, neither was I on
my first big-time rodeo.

845
00:56:07,055 --> 00:56:09,521
I ain't scared.

846
00:56:13,927 --> 00:56:15,629
I don't know
what it is.

847
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:17,930
you've seen people,
you've seen horses,

848
00:56:17,931 --> 00:56:19,466
and you've
seen a calf.

849
00:56:19,467 --> 00:56:20,900
maybe it's just
you're scared

850
00:56:20,901 --> 00:56:23,637
of making like
a fool in front of the crowd,

851
00:56:23,638 --> 00:56:26,838
even though you
know you'll never see them again.

852
00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:41,320
what you signing up for?

853
00:56:41,321 --> 00:56:42,755
saddle broncs,
bareback,

854
00:56:42,756 --> 00:56:44,156
calf roping,
and bulldogging.

855
00:56:44,157 --> 00:56:46,692
the toughest broncs
is always them

856
00:56:46,693 --> 00:56:48,460
you rode
some other place.

857
00:56:48,461 --> 00:56:51,428
cowboys ain't tough
like they used to be.

858
00:56:51,698 --> 00:56:53,598
two years ago
in phoenix,

859
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:56,168
a steer kicked me
in the eye.

860
00:56:56,169 --> 00:56:58,904
I covered my face
with my hands.

861
00:56:58,905 --> 00:57:01,673
old john anderson says,
"are you hurt, book?"

862
00:57:01,674 --> 00:57:03,374
I says, "I believe so."

863
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:05,410
took my hands
off my face.

864
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:06,844
old john fainted
plumb away.

865
00:57:06,845 --> 00:57:09,347
another cowboy
come running up to me.

866
00:57:09,348 --> 00:57:10,948
I said,
"something's dangling.

867
00:57:10,949 --> 00:57:12,917
I believe it's my eye."

868
00:57:12,918 --> 00:57:15,019
he said,
"well, it sure is."

869
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:16,887
so he got me a doctor.

870
00:57:16,888 --> 00:57:18,422
took 17 stitches
around my eye.

871
00:57:18,423 --> 00:57:21,590
next day I won first prize
in the saddle bronc riding.

872
00:57:23,028 --> 00:57:24,761
now ain't that
a windy?

873
00:57:24,762 --> 00:57:27,431
hoot Martin told me
that same story.

874
00:57:27,432 --> 00:57:28,699
that's where I heard it.

875
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:31,600
could I talk to you
in private, Jeff?

876
00:57:32,203 --> 00:57:34,503
yeah.

877
00:57:34,706 --> 00:57:37,073
couldn't borrow
a couple of bucks, could I?

878
00:57:37,074 --> 00:57:40,175
I know I ain't
paid back what I got in cheyenne.

879
00:57:40,945 --> 00:57:42,278
don't worry about it,

880
00:57:42,279 --> 00:57:43,679
as long as
you're keeping books.

881
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,316
I'm keeping books,
right up to the penny.

882
00:57:46,317 --> 00:57:48,751
I'll settle with you
one day.

883
00:57:48,752 --> 00:57:50,619
chico's faster
than these horses.

884
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:53,589
judging
a horse is like judging a woman.

885
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:56,525
you can't tell
by their head or their mane.

886
00:57:56,526 --> 00:57:59,027
I knowed a girl,
had a pretty face,

887
00:57:59,028 --> 00:58:00,429
but she
was so bowlegged,

888
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:02,865
a hog could run
between her legs

889
00:58:02,866 --> 00:58:05,668
and never graze
neither one of them.

890
00:58:11,774 --> 00:58:13,575
if it ain't
my wandering cowboy.

891
00:58:13,576 --> 00:58:14,809
how you been?

892
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:15,610
I can't complain.

893
00:58:15,611 --> 00:58:18,579
I want you to meet
Wes Merritt, my partner.

894
00:58:20,383 --> 00:58:20,948
jim-bob tyler.

895
00:58:20,949 --> 00:58:23,251
if you don't
pay your association dues,

896
00:58:23,252 --> 00:58:25,186
he headlocks you.
he's a director.

897
00:58:25,187 --> 00:58:27,655
I hear you cooled
off high voltage in san angelo.

898
00:58:27,656 --> 00:58:30,324
he'll cool off a lot
before he's through.

899
00:58:30,325 --> 00:58:32,393
ain't you doing
any riding?

900
00:58:32,394 --> 00:58:33,660
no. I'm just along to see

901
00:58:33,661 --> 00:58:36,297
that Wes don't get
on a horse backwards.

902
00:58:36,298 --> 00:58:38,165
might do
a little hazing later.

903
00:58:38,166 --> 00:58:39,966
saddle bronc,
bareback, bulldogging,

904
00:58:39,967 --> 00:58:40,667
and calf roping?

905
00:58:40,668 --> 00:58:41,902
sounds like
a full day's work.

906
00:58:41,903 --> 00:58:42,870
no bull riding?

907
00:58:42,871 --> 00:58:45,373
I got to get him
home in one piece.

908
00:58:45,374 --> 00:58:48,341
I can ride anything
anybody else can.

909
00:58:48,576 --> 00:58:50,110
just like all rookies.

910
00:58:50,111 --> 00:58:52,879
he's too big
for his britches.

911
00:58:55,049 --> 00:58:58,284
once again, it's la fiesta
de los vaqueros time

912
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:00,420
in tucson, arizona,

913
00:59:00,421 --> 00:59:02,688
and our flag bearers
are leading

914
00:59:02,689 --> 00:59:05,258
this very colorful
grand entry parade.

915
00:59:05,259 --> 00:59:07,092
starting the action
this afternoon

916
00:59:07,093 --> 00:59:10,094
is one of the oldest
of our contest events...

917
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:12,532
the saddle bronc riding.

918
00:59:12,533 --> 00:59:13,766
let's go to chute 5,

919
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:15,835
where mickey clayborne
from peekskill, new york,

920
00:59:15,836 --> 00:59:19,003
is getting ready to
come out on double-cross.

921
00:59:38,391 --> 00:59:40,492
is that bob in a sling?

922
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:41,626
sure looks like it.

923
00:59:41,627 --> 00:59:44,128
he's promised not to ride if his arm hurt.

924
00:59:44,129 --> 00:59:45,964
that's the second time sky high's refused.

925
00:59:45,965 --> 00:59:49,099
can't understand why dawson keeps him in the string.

926
00:59:49,435 --> 00:59:51,035
having trouble
with sky high,

927
00:59:51,036 --> 00:59:53,571
so we'll move
to our next contestant...

928
00:59:53,572 --> 00:59:55,139
Wes Merritt
of big springs, texas,

929
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:58,241
riding devil dancer
out of chute number 3.

930
01:00:08,086 --> 01:00:09,753
now you can
see how a man

931
01:00:09,754 --> 01:00:12,755
can stand and sit
at the same time

932
01:00:13,257 --> 01:00:15,892
while riding a bronc.

933
01:00:22,367 --> 01:00:24,100
an event requiring
skill and teamwork

934
01:00:24,101 --> 01:00:27,303
between horse and rider
is next on our program...

935
01:00:27,671 --> 01:00:28,505
calf roping.

936
01:00:28,506 --> 01:00:29,873
see you later, honey.

937
01:00:29,874 --> 01:00:32,475
calf roping
is an everyday part

938
01:00:32,476 --> 01:00:33,376
of a cowboy's life.

939
01:00:33,377 --> 01:00:35,077
when a cowboy  sees a sick calf

940
01:00:35,078 --> 01:00:36,045
or an unbranded calf,

941
01:00:36,046 --> 01:00:39,314
he relies on two things  to catch the little fella...

942
01:00:39,516 --> 01:00:40,916
his rope and his horse.

943
01:00:40,917 --> 01:00:42,751
our first roper
this afternoon

944
01:00:42,752 --> 01:00:45,820
will be buster burgess
of butte, montana.

945
01:01:10,779 --> 01:01:12,212
buster tied his calf

946
01:01:12,213 --> 01:01:15,315
in the excellent time
of 14 seconds flat.

947
01:01:15,751 --> 01:01:17,217
that's second-best
so far.

948
01:01:17,218 --> 01:01:20,286
he ought to wind up
in the day money, grace.

949
01:01:22,223 --> 01:01:25,125
the next man to rope
is Wes Merritt

950
01:01:25,126 --> 01:01:27,760
of big springs, texas.

951
01:01:40,741 --> 01:01:42,408
he's going to try again.

952
01:01:42,409 --> 01:01:45,545
the rules say that Wes
is allowed two loops.

953
01:02:02,963 --> 01:02:05,997
time for Wes Merritt
is 21.4 seconds.

954
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,833
cheer up, louise.

955
01:02:07,834 --> 01:02:10,635
it happens to
the best of them.

956
01:02:11,972 --> 01:02:13,973
our next event
is bulldogging,

957
01:02:13,974 --> 01:02:15,273
a favorite
among rodeo fans

958
01:02:15,274 --> 01:02:18,342
because of its spectacular
and dangerous action.

959
01:02:42,001 --> 01:02:44,634
burgess' time, 11.2.

960
01:02:46,238 --> 01:02:49,172
30 feet's a pretty
long score, ain't it?

961
01:02:49,274 --> 01:02:51,975
yeah. the steer's got
a big head start.

962
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:52,843
when chico overtakes him,

963
01:02:52,844 --> 01:02:54,911
you'll be going
30 miles an hour.

964
01:02:54,912 --> 01:02:56,747
I thought
you'd like to know,

965
01:02:56,748 --> 01:02:59,682
this steer set up
on me last go around.

966
01:02:59,751 --> 01:03:01,217
thanks, slim.
get down early.

967
01:03:01,218 --> 01:03:03,319
you might override
and miss him.

968
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,522
our next bulldogger
is Wes Merritt

969
01:03:05,523 --> 01:03:07,823
of big springs, texas.

970
01:03:07,824 --> 01:03:10,492
let's get
the job done.

971
01:03:15,032 --> 01:03:16,132
hazing for Wes Merritt

972
01:03:16,133 --> 01:03:19,233
is a familiar name
and face to rodeo fans,

973
01:03:19,436 --> 01:03:21,936
Jeff mccloud.

974
01:03:26,977 --> 01:03:29,544
let's make it good.

975
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,967
reckon he's
in mexico by now.

976
01:03:55,437 --> 01:03:56,370
now you can see

977
01:03:56,371 --> 01:03:58,539
how dangerous
this contest really is.

978
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:00,608
it's quite
a jolt to the dogger

979
01:04:00,609 --> 01:04:03,776
when he grabs dirt instead
of a steer's horns.

980
01:04:06,481 --> 01:04:09,550
action moves once again
to the bucking chutes.

981
01:04:09,551 --> 01:04:12,086
our first event...
wild brahma bull riding.

982
01:04:12,087 --> 01:04:13,721
in the interest
of public safety,

983
01:04:13,722 --> 01:04:16,889
we ask all spectators
seated in the front rows

984
01:04:16,925 --> 01:04:18,859
and folks standing
along the fence

985
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:20,827
not to wave anything
at these bulls

986
01:04:20,828 --> 01:04:22,229
to attract
their attention.

987
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:23,930
brahma bulls
have been known

988
01:04:23,931 --> 01:04:27,100
to jump an 8-foot fence
from a standing start.

989
01:04:27,368 --> 01:04:29,936
these four-legged packages
of dynamite

990
01:04:29,937 --> 01:04:32,871
are not exactly
household pets.

991
01:04:37,878 --> 01:04:38,945
ready?

992
01:04:38,946 --> 01:04:42,013
you were smart
not to sign up for these bangs.

993
01:04:42,382 --> 01:04:44,316
I did sign up.

994
01:04:44,317 --> 01:04:46,452
did you ever
ride a brahma?

995
01:04:46,453 --> 01:04:48,721
a lot of horses.
no bulls.

996
01:04:48,722 --> 01:04:50,922
who'd you draw?

997
01:04:50,923 --> 01:04:52,324
yo-yo.

998
01:04:52,325 --> 01:04:53,626
hey, boys,

999
01:04:53,627 --> 01:04:55,193
this fella
drawed yo-yo.

1000
01:04:55,194 --> 01:04:57,962
he's never rode
a bull before.

1001
01:04:59,832 --> 01:05:01,399
bad bull, huh?

1002
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,568
only been rode
once in his life.

1003
01:05:03,569 --> 01:05:06,703
red, tell him
what yo-yo done to stubby johnson.

1004
01:05:07,106 --> 01:05:09,874
he threw stubby
halfway across new mexico.

1005
01:05:09,875 --> 01:05:11,209
then he run him down

1006
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:14,145
and near gored
and stomped him to death.

1007
01:05:14,247 --> 01:05:15,446
he's kind of mean.

1008
01:05:15,447 --> 01:05:18,249
arnold barry
on spitfire.

1009
01:05:30,528 --> 01:05:31,962
look,
when you get throwed,

1010
01:05:31,963 --> 01:05:34,631
let the clowns
take care of him.

1011
01:05:34,632 --> 01:05:35,565
just lay still.

1012
01:05:35,566 --> 01:05:38,467
that bull's liable
to eat you up alive.

1013
01:05:38,803 --> 01:05:40,470
maybe
I won't get throwed.

1014
01:05:40,471 --> 01:05:43,506
that's one thing you
don't have to worry about.

1015
01:05:43,708 --> 01:05:45,542
you'll get throwed,
all right.

1016
01:05:45,543 --> 01:05:48,111
next rider in
this action-packed event

1017
01:05:48,112 --> 01:05:50,681
is chuck peterson
from calgary, canada,

1018
01:05:50,682 --> 01:05:53,615
riding a bull
called night life.

1019
01:06:15,205 --> 01:06:18,239
let's give our rodeo clowns
a big hand

1020
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:21,242
for their daring
and skill.

1021
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:23,312
buster burgess
of butte, montana,

1022
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:24,979
is coming out
of chute 5

1023
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:27,249
on a bull named
time bomb.

1024
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,950
burgess can go
anytime now.

1025
01:06:51,873 --> 01:06:54,874
first aid
to the arena immediately.

1026
01:06:57,211 --> 01:06:58,412
don't touch him, boys.

1027
01:06:58,413 --> 01:07:01,180
wait till
the doc gets here.

1028
01:07:14,395 --> 01:07:17,297
cliff roberts
of alexander, louisiana,

1029
01:07:17,298 --> 01:07:20,031
will ride spring fever.

1030
01:07:43,756 --> 01:07:45,324
that was a rough one,

1031
01:07:45,325 --> 01:07:48,125
bull wetting
his horn like that.

1032
01:07:50,663 --> 01:07:53,597
good thing you're
not riding any bulls.

1033
01:07:54,233 --> 01:07:56,533
I am.

1034
01:07:56,668 --> 01:07:57,501
you what?

1035
01:07:57,502 --> 01:07:59,905
I went back
and signed up.

1036
01:07:59,906 --> 01:08:01,572
why?

1037
01:08:01,573 --> 01:08:04,174
I ain't wearing diapers.

1038
01:08:05,577 --> 01:08:07,945
you take things
the wrong way, Wes.

1039
01:08:07,946 --> 01:08:09,847
I'm in this business
to make money.

1040
01:08:09,848 --> 01:08:12,616
the more
events I enter, the more I make.

1041
01:08:12,617 --> 01:08:14,284
if an accident
scares me,

1042
01:08:14,285 --> 01:08:15,586
I'll find out
right now.

1043
01:08:15,587 --> 01:08:18,255
you're substituting
guts for good judgment.

1044
01:08:18,256 --> 01:08:20,122
am I?

1045
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:27,731
he is riding
a bull called yo-yo.

1046
01:08:27,732 --> 01:08:29,599
yo-yo's a very
famous bull.

1047
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,236
he's never been rode
to the limit.

1048
01:08:32,237 --> 01:08:33,470
you draw yo-yo?

1049
01:08:33,471 --> 01:08:34,604
you know about him?

1050
01:08:34,605 --> 01:08:36,573
sometimes he spins,
sometimes he doesn't.

1051
01:08:36,574 --> 01:08:39,575
if he unloads you,
don't do like burgess did.

1052
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:41,143
you just freeze.

1053
01:08:41,144 --> 01:08:43,912
let the clowns
handle the bull.

1054
01:08:44,715 --> 01:08:47,082
good luck.

1055
01:08:48,986 --> 01:08:50,686
remember
what I told you.

1056
01:08:50,687 --> 01:08:53,122
take a dive.
ain't no disgrace.

1057
01:08:53,123 --> 01:08:54,090
are you kidding?

1058
01:08:54,091 --> 01:08:55,458
never was a bull
that couldn't be rode.

1059
01:08:55,459 --> 01:08:57,593
never was a cowboy that
couldn't be throwed.

1060
01:08:57,594 --> 01:09:00,462
eat a little dirt
if you have to.

1061
01:09:08,404 --> 01:09:09,404
here's a flash, folks.

1062
01:09:09,405 --> 01:09:12,639
Wes Merritt's riding
the first bull of his career.

1063
01:09:12,775 --> 01:09:15,476
I'm not going
to let him.

1064
01:09:16,845 --> 01:09:17,512
sorry, lady.

1065
01:09:17,513 --> 01:09:20,314
he's not going
to ride that bull.

1066
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:34,127
let me have him!

1067
01:09:42,137 --> 01:09:44,670
give it to him, Wes!

1068
01:09:54,214 --> 01:09:55,248
come on, let's go.

1069
01:09:55,249 --> 01:09:57,083
you've just seen
history made.

1070
01:09:57,084 --> 01:10:00,119
Wes Merritt rode yo-yo
to the finish.

1071
01:10:06,393 --> 01:10:09,328
I should have listened
to you and booker.

1072
01:10:10,063 --> 01:10:11,397
how'd I get out here?

1073
01:10:11,398 --> 01:10:13,065
you rode him, man.

1074
01:10:14,701 --> 01:10:16,869
that's the way
to make money...

1075
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:18,470
while
you're asleep.

1076
01:10:18,471 --> 01:10:20,538
you rode yo-yo
to a standstill.

1077
01:10:20,539 --> 01:10:22,174
first day
on the circuit,

1078
01:10:22,175 --> 01:10:23,875
and you're
a big man.

1079
01:10:23,876 --> 01:10:26,843
- who, me?
- sure, you.

1080
01:10:29,415 --> 01:10:31,048
nice going, Wes.

1081
01:10:31,717 --> 01:10:33,452
I rode him, honey.
I rode him.

1082
01:10:33,453 --> 01:10:36,553
what's the matter?
you're shaking like a leaf.

1083
01:10:36,589 --> 01:10:40,489
I never want to go
through that again.

1084
01:11:03,915 --> 01:11:06,383
a new
world's record... 10 seconds flat.

1085
01:11:06,384 --> 01:11:09,318
you busted me.
that's against the rules.

1086
01:11:22,766 --> 01:11:24,299
come on, cowboy.

1087
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,035
show us how
you rode yo-yo.

1088
01:11:26,036 --> 01:11:27,236
I'm pretty beat...

1089
01:11:27,237 --> 01:11:29,638
don't be like that,
Wes. come on.

1090
01:11:29,639 --> 01:11:32,606
in such cases,
the thing to do is this.

1091
01:11:35,012 --> 01:11:37,945
get a beer and cool
that loud mouth off.

1092
01:11:39,282 --> 01:11:41,149
one little ride, Wes.

1093
01:11:41,150 --> 01:11:43,652
beat it.
he's got a horse.

1094
01:11:43,653 --> 01:11:46,053
come here.

1095
01:11:46,789 --> 01:11:49,189
right here.

1096
01:11:50,292 --> 01:11:51,192
Wes Merritt.

1097
01:11:51,193 --> 01:11:53,127
sure, Wes.
nice going today.

1098
01:11:53,128 --> 01:11:54,595
Wes Merritt.

1099
01:11:54,596 --> 01:11:56,931
$879.14.

1100
01:11:57,366 --> 01:11:58,800
check or cash?

1101
01:11:58,801 --> 01:11:59,668
cash!

1102
01:11:59,669 --> 01:12:00,368
hi, everybody.

1103
01:12:00,369 --> 01:12:03,170
I hope you saved
a little for me.

1104
01:12:03,372 --> 01:12:06,173
I've got gasoline
money coming.

1105
01:12:06,691 --> 01:12:09,093
man, where's
this rodeoing been all my life?

1106
01:12:09,094 --> 01:12:12,261
there'll be a lot
of days when you come up empty.

1107
01:12:13,032 --> 01:12:15,198
I've got
$439.57 coming.

1108
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:17,835
I don't know much
about reading and writing,

1109
01:12:17,836 --> 01:12:20,470
but I've got
an aptness for figures.

1110
01:12:20,471 --> 01:12:21,972
he gets half, remember?

1111
01:12:21,973 --> 01:12:23,241
I won't let him
forget.

1112
01:12:25,009 --> 01:12:26,543
I owe you
the change.

1113
01:12:26,544 --> 01:12:27,577
I'll owe you.

1114
01:12:27,578 --> 01:12:30,712
come on, champ.
winner has to buy the drinks.

1115
01:12:31,148 --> 01:12:33,750
we'll bring him back
in great shape.

1116
01:12:33,751 --> 01:12:36,553
hey, you a pretty
good drinker?

1117
01:12:36,554 --> 01:12:37,186
how's that?

1118
01:12:37,187 --> 01:12:39,823
I never saw you drink.
just asking.

1119
01:12:39,824 --> 01:12:41,624
he's got to work
in the morning.

1120
01:12:41,625 --> 01:12:44,626
there are a few things
he can do by himself.

1121
01:12:45,195 --> 01:12:47,030
if you want a drink,
take it.

1122
01:12:47,031 --> 01:12:49,431
if he can't,
ring the bell.

1123
01:12:49,432 --> 01:12:50,133
cut it out.

1124
01:12:50,134 --> 01:12:53,135
people will think
you don't like each other.

1125
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:08,649
tell them about
the wild horse stampede.

1126
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:11,653
I couldn't count them.
part-wild horse myself.

1127
01:13:11,654 --> 01:13:13,788
never been curried
below the knees.

1128
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:16,857
never been curried
above the neck, either.

1129
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:18,059
you said it,

1130
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,260
but I come
by my wildness natural.

1131
01:13:20,261 --> 01:13:23,296
once, my ma was loping
across the great plains

1132
01:13:23,532 --> 01:13:24,965
on a paint horse.

1133
01:13:24,966 --> 01:13:26,367
kiowas was after her.

1134
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:28,169
she was about
ready to foal.

1135
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:31,104
suddenly, she got a pain
in her stomach.

1136
01:13:31,239 --> 01:13:34,108
she got off the horse,
and I was born.

1137
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:35,943
while I was being born,

1138
01:13:35,944 --> 01:13:38,478
the paint horse
had a colt.

1139
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:39,613
the kiowas
was closing in.

1140
01:13:39,614 --> 01:13:42,249
she jumped on the horse,
I jumped on the colt,

1141
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:44,984
and I've been riding
horses ever since.

1142
01:13:44,985 --> 01:13:47,887
you been riding
a lot of bulls, too.

1143
01:14:28,628 --> 01:14:31,528
how about a little
drop for me, sugar?

1144
01:14:32,298 --> 01:14:35,132
you just pour it
till it runs over.

1145
01:14:40,673 --> 01:14:43,641
I'm going to put
my brand on you, sugar.

1146
01:14:51,583 --> 01:14:53,951
that's my brand, sugar.

1147
01:14:53,952 --> 01:14:56,486
you catch on fast.

1148
01:14:58,223 --> 01:15:01,258
hi. al, I'd like you
to meet louise Merritt.

1149
01:15:01,826 --> 01:15:04,428
oh. we sort of
met before.

1150
01:15:04,429 --> 01:15:05,529
somebody got a lid?

1151
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:08,531
looks like this place
is going to boil over.

1152
01:15:14,072 --> 01:15:16,839
hey, grace.
burgess all right?

1153
01:15:22,246 --> 01:15:24,780
you poor dumb fools.

1154
01:15:25,583 --> 01:15:26,849
kidding yourselves.

1155
01:15:26,850 --> 01:15:28,885
calling this
a sport!

1156
01:15:28,886 --> 01:15:31,953
a bunch of
crazy men paying for the privilege

1157
01:15:32,423 --> 01:15:34,490
of getting
yourselves killed.

1158
01:15:34,491 --> 01:15:36,893
my husband did it

1159
01:15:36,894 --> 01:15:39,628
with $25
of borrowed money.

1160
01:16:08,190 --> 01:16:08,790
relax, baby.

1161
01:16:08,791 --> 01:16:11,658
we'll take care
of the hitching-up.

1162
01:16:13,262 --> 01:16:14,562
oh, my aching head.

1163
01:16:14,563 --> 01:16:17,331
we'll take care
of that, too.

1164
01:16:20,385 --> 01:16:22,786
right here.

1165
01:16:31,029 --> 01:16:33,395
this way.

1166
01:16:44,041 --> 01:16:46,709
he don't
drink too good.

1167
01:16:49,246 --> 01:16:51,581
he's going to have
a balloon head.

1168
01:16:51,582 --> 01:16:53,316
maybe he won't
be able to rodeo.

1169
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:55,819
I don't care
if he never rodeos again.

1170
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:58,454
still want
that ranch, don't you?

1171
01:17:00,524 --> 01:17:02,458
I had what I wanted.

1172
01:17:02,859 --> 01:17:05,460
that little 2 x 4 cabin?

1173
01:17:05,695 --> 01:17:08,595
- happiness.
- for you, maybe.

1174
01:17:09,431 --> 01:17:11,665
- how about him? maybe he wasn't happy.
- he was until you came.

1175
01:17:10,967 --> 01:17:13,801
if he'd stuck
to the jackhammer...

1176
01:17:16,072 --> 01:17:17,973
lady, the world's
full of prizes.

1177
01:17:17,974 --> 01:17:20,942
every fella likes
to take a shot at them.

1178
01:17:21,643 --> 01:17:23,111
if he misses, fine.

1179
01:17:23,112 --> 01:17:25,313
but at least he tried.

1180
01:17:25,314 --> 01:17:27,681
you tried.

1181
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:29,517
what did you win?

1182
01:17:30,518 --> 01:17:32,420
I made a thousand
bartenders rich in my time.

1183
01:17:32,421 --> 01:17:35,622
I've thrown away
the down payment for a dozen spreads

1184
01:17:36,692 --> 01:17:37,925
over a crap table.

1185
01:17:37,926 --> 01:17:40,761
I had 18 great years
all by myself.

1186
01:17:41,229 --> 01:17:43,529
Wes has got you.

1187
01:17:44,530 --> 01:17:47,465
if I'd had somebody like you,
it might have been a different.

1188
01:17:48,269 --> 01:17:50,003
what would it
have changed?

1189
01:17:50,072 --> 01:17:53,472
maybe nothing. maybe everything.

1190
01:17:58,746 --> 01:18:01,714
you don't believe me
a little bit, do you?

1191
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:06,118
I never met a man
who didn't do a little lying.

1192
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:09,288
you can believe what
you want to about me,

1193
01:18:09,489 --> 01:18:11,324
but you're
keeping the books.

1194
01:18:11,325 --> 01:18:13,559
they ain't lying.

1195
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,160
Wes is doing real good.

1196
01:18:17,230 --> 01:18:19,131
getting his brains
kicked out,

1197
01:18:19,132 --> 01:18:20,600
that's how good
he's doing.

1198
01:18:20,601 --> 01:18:23,500
he's trying to do it
all in one season.

1199
01:18:23,703 --> 01:18:25,871
the big ones
are coming up now...

1200
01:18:25,872 --> 01:18:27,339
livermore, salinas,
cheyenne, pendleton.

1201
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:29,874
we ought to get
together on this.

1202
01:18:29,875 --> 01:18:31,076
we could be friends.

1203
01:18:31,077 --> 01:18:33,312
I haven't got
so many friends.

1204
01:18:33,313 --> 01:18:35,447
I could do
with one more.

1205
01:18:35,448 --> 01:18:37,349
let me give you
some advice.

1206
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:39,551
when you sit down
to a big dinner,

1207
01:18:39,552 --> 01:18:41,085
just loosen your belt.

1208
01:18:41,086 --> 01:18:43,587
more fun that way.

1209
01:18:45,825 --> 01:18:48,059
thanks for the hitch-up.

1210
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:48,860
ok, Jeff.

1211
01:18:48,861 --> 01:18:51,494
see you
in livermore.

1212
01:19:00,839 --> 01:19:02,173
he minds you well.

1213
01:19:02,324 --> 01:19:04,192
horses are
a lot like women.

1214
01:19:04,193 --> 01:19:07,059
they mind you a
little bit for love,

1215
01:19:07,061 --> 01:19:08,796
but a lot more
from fear.

1216
01:19:08,797 --> 01:19:12,731
it's easier to get
a horse afraid of you than a woman.

1217
01:19:13,568 --> 01:19:15,968
where's Wes?

1218
01:19:16,437 --> 01:19:18,838
no telling.

1219
01:19:30,617 --> 01:19:32,552
hey, anybody in there?

1220
01:19:32,553 --> 01:19:33,986
come on in.

1221
01:19:35,422 --> 01:19:36,589
are you all right?

1222
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:39,357
grace gave me
a cup of coffee.

1223
01:19:39,459 --> 01:19:41,993
sure needed it.

1224
01:19:43,263 --> 01:19:46,231
I'm sorry about how
I acted at the hotel.

1225
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:47,933
all these years,

1226
01:19:47,934 --> 01:19:50,336
waiting for something
to happen to buster,

1227
01:19:50,337 --> 01:19:52,904
telling myself
I wouldn't blow my top,

1228
01:19:52,905 --> 01:19:55,206
training myself not to.

1229
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:57,676
then it does happen,
and...

1230
01:19:57,677 --> 01:19:59,177
well, it was like

1231
01:19:59,178 --> 01:20:00,879
I never
told myself nothing

1232
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,481
or never
practiced at all.

1233
01:20:03,482 --> 01:20:05,149
couldn't help it.

1234
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:07,852
this is all
I got to show

1235
01:20:08,153 --> 01:20:10,888
for 15 years
of married life.

1236
01:20:12,591 --> 01:20:15,025
it's not much.

1237
01:20:16,095 --> 01:20:19,129
get out of this
while the getting's good.

1238
01:20:19,163 --> 01:20:22,065
rodeoing will make
an old woman of you

1239
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:24,517
before your time.

1240
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:27,587
well, let me get
my things together,

1241
01:20:27,822 --> 01:20:30,590
and you can
have the trailer.

1242
01:20:32,193 --> 01:20:34,694
I bought this rig.

1243
01:20:39,033 --> 01:20:39,733
you what?

1244
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:42,668
we have to have
a place to sleep, honey.

1245
01:20:43,704 --> 01:20:46,505
besides, grace
needed the money.

1246
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:39,580
you send the entry fees
to pendleton?

1247
01:22:39,715 --> 01:22:42,183
yes, I did.

1248
01:22:48,358 --> 01:22:51,425
why ain't you dressed yet?
it's almost showtime.

1249
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:53,595
I'm tired, Wes.

1250
01:22:53,596 --> 01:22:54,996
I'll stay here.

1251
01:22:54,997 --> 01:22:56,531
what's the matter,
honey?

1252
01:22:56,532 --> 01:22:57,866
nothing's the matter.

1253
01:22:57,867 --> 01:23:00,167
it's just
that after cheyenne...

1254
01:23:00,168 --> 01:23:01,002
aw, cheyenne.

1255
01:23:01,003 --> 01:23:03,271
that bull
was spooky, that's all.

1256
01:23:03,272 --> 01:23:06,406
I can't sit
in that grandstand and watch anymore.

1257
01:23:06,541 --> 01:23:08,742
I'll be here
when you come back.

1258
01:23:08,743 --> 01:23:10,244
look how excited
ginny gets

1259
01:23:10,245 --> 01:23:12,846
when red's coming out
of the chute.

1260
01:23:12,847 --> 01:23:14,014
she don't worry him.

1261
01:23:14,015 --> 01:23:15,449
ginny ain't
the worrying type.

1262
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:18,451
now, honey, nothing's
going to happen to me.

1263
01:23:18,686 --> 01:23:20,053
I'm dumb, and I'm lucky.

1264
01:23:20,054 --> 01:23:22,022
come out
to the show tonight,

1265
01:23:22,023 --> 01:23:23,590
and afterwards
we'll celebrate.

1266
01:23:23,591 --> 01:23:26,293
you been spending
an awful lot of money.

1267
01:23:26,294 --> 01:23:28,561
we've got the money
to spend

1268
01:23:28,562 --> 01:23:31,064
for the first time
in our lives.

1269
01:23:31,065 --> 01:23:33,600
all week long, you been
yapping about money.

1270
01:23:33,601 --> 01:23:36,136
don't make me
sound like a nag.

1271
01:23:36,137 --> 01:23:37,770
well, then stop worrying.

1272
01:23:37,771 --> 01:23:39,705
you get me riled up.

1273
01:23:39,706 --> 01:23:41,273
I'm all in one piece.

1274
01:23:41,274 --> 01:23:44,075
that's how
I want you to stay.

1275
01:23:48,882 --> 01:23:51,250
you better go.
you'll be late.

1276
01:23:51,251 --> 01:23:54,152
if you still want to
go out afterwards,

1277
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:55,720
all right, we'll go.

1278
01:23:55,721 --> 01:23:57,089
that's more like it.

1279
01:23:57,090 --> 01:23:59,358
starting off
with red clauson

1280
01:23:59,359 --> 01:24:00,559
from kearney, nebraska,

1281
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,328
on a horse called
politician.

1282
01:24:04,196 --> 01:24:05,964
they've got this one
named right.

1283
01:24:05,965 --> 01:24:09,133
he don't seem able to
figure where he's going.

1284
01:24:14,941 --> 01:24:17,142
now out of chute number 2,

1285
01:24:17,143 --> 01:24:20,144
Wes Merritt,
from big springs, texas,

1286
01:24:20,646 --> 01:24:23,546
on a horse called
acey-deucy.

1287
01:24:24,083 --> 01:24:26,083
he's already
won more prize money

1288
01:24:26,084 --> 01:24:28,085
in his first year
of competition

1289
01:24:28,086 --> 01:24:30,287
than any other
newcomer to rodeo

1290
01:24:30,288 --> 01:24:32,889
that I can remember.

1291
01:24:34,793 --> 01:24:36,160
outside!

1292
01:24:40,966 --> 01:24:43,100
Wes is in trouble!

1293
01:24:43,101 --> 01:24:45,469
watch it!

1294
01:24:45,470 --> 01:24:48,437
somebody give
that cowboy a hand!

1295
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:51,140
that was a rough one.

1296
01:24:51,141 --> 01:24:52,275
he's a lucky cowboy

1297
01:24:52,276 --> 01:24:55,378
to be walking away
from a spill like that.

1298
01:24:55,713 --> 01:24:57,814
and now,
ladies and gentlemen,

1299
01:24:57,815 --> 01:24:59,983
we go to chute number 7

1300
01:24:59,984 --> 01:25:03,151
for walt matthews
coming out on ride away.

1301
01:26:08,816 --> 01:26:11,349
that's a pretty sky.

1302
01:26:11,753 --> 01:26:13,720
leg giving you
trouble, book?

1303
01:26:13,721 --> 01:26:16,789
either my boot's too little,
or my leg's too big.

1304
01:26:19,426 --> 01:26:20,726
seen Wes?

1305
01:26:20,727 --> 01:26:22,062
no.

1306
01:26:22,063 --> 01:26:24,697
how long you think
he'll last?

1307
01:26:24,698 --> 01:26:27,766
he'll be
around long enough to buy some cows.

1308
01:26:27,901 --> 01:26:29,702
cows. wind pudding
and air sauce.

1309
01:26:29,703 --> 01:26:31,670
he won't buy no cows.

1310
01:26:31,671 --> 01:26:32,472
he won't?

1311
01:26:32,473 --> 01:26:35,373
town shoes, a fancy car,
and bourbon...

1312
01:26:35,476 --> 01:26:38,109
that's all he'll ever buy.

1313
01:26:39,145 --> 01:26:41,046
all right, booker,
quit grandstanding.

1314
01:26:41,047 --> 01:26:43,181
what do you got to say?

1315
01:26:43,182 --> 01:26:46,050
the boys been saying
you've changed.

1316
01:26:46,652 --> 01:26:48,853
yeah. my whiskers
got longer.

1317
01:26:48,854 --> 01:26:51,888
you're waiting around
for something to happen.

1318
01:26:52,158 --> 01:26:54,058
you're reading
the tea leaves.

1319
01:26:54,059 --> 01:26:55,860
what's going to happen?

1320
01:26:55,861 --> 01:26:57,161
I don't know,

1321
01:26:57,162 --> 01:26:58,396
but I'll tell you,

1322
01:26:58,397 --> 01:26:59,664
there's only two things

1323
01:26:59,665 --> 01:27:02,566
ever kept you
in one place for long...

1324
01:27:06,739 --> 01:27:09,339
a crap game or a woman.

1325
01:27:13,711 --> 01:27:14,812
I ain't seen you

1326
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:17,580
with a pair of dice
for weeks.

1327
01:27:28,126 --> 01:27:29,693
is Wes here?

1328
01:27:29,694 --> 01:27:30,560
not yet.

1329
01:27:30,561 --> 01:27:32,029
probably looking
at chico.

1330
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:33,596
something wrong
with chico?

1331
01:27:33,597 --> 01:27:36,198
he's got a little colic.

1332
01:27:36,433 --> 01:27:37,567
what's cooking?

1333
01:27:37,568 --> 01:27:39,001
what'll you have?

1334
01:27:39,002 --> 01:27:40,570
what are you offering?

1335
01:27:40,571 --> 01:27:42,071
to you? pot roast.

1336
01:27:42,072 --> 01:27:43,540
I like pot roast.

1337
01:27:43,541 --> 01:27:44,974
and potato pancakes?

1338
01:27:44,975 --> 01:27:46,008
I like potato pancakes.

1339
01:27:46,009 --> 01:27:48,578
you brought good cooking
to the trailer camps.

1340
01:27:48,579 --> 01:27:51,513
be fine with me
when I take it out, too.

1341
01:27:52,082 --> 01:27:55,016
well, we got enough
money for the ranch.

1342
01:27:56,987 --> 01:27:58,453
4,100.

1343
01:27:58,454 --> 01:27:59,855
4,100? you need 5,000.

1344
01:27:59,856 --> 01:28:02,590
you don't know
that jeremiah.

1345
01:28:02,692 --> 01:28:05,360
you don't know
jeremiah.

1346
01:28:14,804 --> 01:28:17,872
you really want him
off the circuit, don't you?

1347
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:19,307
don't you?

1348
01:28:19,308 --> 01:28:21,642
I want whatever you want.

1349
01:28:24,446 --> 01:28:26,847
hey, look who's back
in pendleton.

1350
01:28:26,848 --> 01:28:29,417
she's having
a big party tonight.

1351
01:28:29,418 --> 01:28:30,418
we're all invited.

1352
01:28:30,419 --> 01:28:33,420
what do you want, doll,
some more branding?

1353
01:28:34,456 --> 01:28:36,391
hey, babs! hey!

1354
01:28:36,392 --> 01:28:39,358
well, I'll square things
with her later.

1355
01:28:43,899 --> 01:28:46,565
I got a surprise
for you.

1356
01:28:50,071 --> 01:28:52,039
whose idea
was this, yours?

1357
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:54,341
I thought
you'd be pleased.

1358
01:28:54,342 --> 01:28:55,342
with what?

1359
01:28:55,343 --> 01:28:56,476
I ain't in no hurry

1360
01:28:56,477 --> 01:28:59,478
to go back scratching
a living dirt farming.

1361
01:28:59,747 --> 01:29:01,114
what's wrong
with this life?

1362
01:29:01,115 --> 01:29:03,982
steak for dinner,
money in the bank.

1363
01:29:04,384 --> 01:29:05,619
you got what you wanted.

1364
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:08,621
somebody ask you
to stick your nose in this?

1365
01:29:09,022 --> 01:29:11,858
fella always said
I had a big nose.

1366
01:29:11,859 --> 01:29:14,860
I thought that's what
we were rodeoing for.

1367
01:29:14,894 --> 01:29:17,895
let's go back where we
can breathe clean air.

1368
01:29:18,398 --> 01:29:20,399
there's nothing wrong
with this air.

1369
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:22,568
all I smell's
the money I win.

1370
01:29:22,569 --> 01:29:24,336
you like
how it smells.

1371
01:29:24,337 --> 01:29:25,438
you don't?

1372
01:29:25,439 --> 01:29:26,472
it stinks!

1373
01:29:26,473 --> 01:29:27,205
when I found you,

1374
01:29:27,206 --> 01:29:30,441
you couldn't put
4 quarters together to make a dollar.

1375
01:29:30,610 --> 01:29:33,178
who had the ambition,
you or me?

1376
01:29:34,147 --> 01:29:35,981
that's right, me.

1377
01:29:35,982 --> 01:29:38,815
I'm sick
of this yap, yap, yap.

1378
01:29:40,586 --> 01:29:41,819
and one thing more...

1379
01:29:41,820 --> 01:29:44,721
I'm getting fed up
with you freeloading

1380
01:29:44,757 --> 01:29:47,291
on the money I win.

1381
01:29:56,567 --> 01:29:59,469
sounds like
a declaration of war.

1382
01:30:01,139 --> 01:30:02,173
well, it leaves us

1383
01:30:02,174 --> 01:30:04,608
that much more
of the pot roast to eat.

1384
01:30:04,609 --> 01:30:07,643
he'll go to that party
and get drunk, won't he?

1385
01:30:08,246 --> 01:30:11,314
he's not just going there
to count the bottles.

1386
01:30:11,983 --> 01:30:14,685
why don't you
just take it easy,

1387
01:30:14,686 --> 01:30:15,885
and I'll wait table?

1388
01:30:15,886 --> 01:30:18,887
I'm supposed to sit
here, waiting for him

1389
01:30:18,990 --> 01:30:21,357
to come staggering
through that door.

1390
01:30:21,358 --> 01:30:24,359
then I'm supposed to
put my arms around him,

1391
01:30:24,728 --> 01:30:26,129
make him black coffee,

1392
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:28,764
stick an ice bag
on his head,

1393
01:30:28,765 --> 01:30:30,266
take off his boots,

1394
01:30:30,267 --> 01:30:32,368
and put him to bed.

1395
01:30:32,369 --> 01:30:35,036
the pot roast is real good.

1396
01:30:35,405 --> 01:30:36,806
I'm no fun.

1397
01:30:36,807 --> 01:30:37,873
that blond dame

1398
01:30:37,874 --> 01:30:40,842
with her dress cut down
to her kneecaps...

1399
01:30:40,877 --> 01:30:42,945
she's fun.

1400
01:30:42,946 --> 01:30:45,113
yeah.

1401
01:30:45,114 --> 01:30:46,581
well, she's something.

1402
01:30:46,582 --> 01:30:49,518
well, I'm through saving
his pennies for him.

1403
01:30:49,519 --> 01:30:52,387
I'm through washing his
socks and his shirts.

1404
01:30:52,388 --> 01:30:54,556
I'm through
worrying about him

1405
01:30:54,557 --> 01:30:56,458
and cleaning up
after him.

1406
01:30:56,459 --> 01:30:58,460
he ain't 2 years old,

1407
01:30:58,461 --> 01:31:00,194
and I ain't his mother.

1408
01:31:00,195 --> 01:31:03,096
ever think you might,
uh, fall in love

1409
01:31:04,166 --> 01:31:06,700
with somebody else?

1410
01:31:09,404 --> 01:31:10,338
just asked.

1411
01:31:10,339 --> 01:31:13,139
it happens
every day of the week.

1412
01:31:13,208 --> 01:31:16,142
men! I'd like to fry 'em
all in deep fat!

1413
01:31:23,752 --> 01:31:24,985
what you
looking for?

1414
01:31:24,986 --> 01:31:27,588
my one decent pair
of silk stockings

1415
01:31:27,589 --> 01:31:30,356
to go with
my one decent dress.

1416
01:31:30,625 --> 01:31:32,993
say, you don't
happen to own

1417
01:31:32,994 --> 01:31:35,862
any of that black
lingerie, do you?

1418
01:31:36,497 --> 01:31:38,765
no.

1419
01:31:38,833 --> 01:31:41,633
by the way,
where are we going?

1420
01:31:43,937 --> 01:31:46,206
I'm going to the party.

1421
01:31:46,207 --> 01:31:48,575
Wes is kind of mean.

1422
01:31:48,576 --> 01:31:51,009
well, so am I.

1423
01:31:51,879 --> 01:31:54,780
why don't you just
eat this nice supper

1424
01:31:55,148 --> 01:31:56,515
and wait it out?

1425
01:31:56,516 --> 01:31:58,984
I'm tired of being
a good little wife

1426
01:31:58,985 --> 01:32:00,552
who waits things out.

1427
01:32:00,553 --> 01:32:01,653
oh, he'll be back.

1428
01:32:01,654 --> 01:32:04,323
he might be drunk,
but he'll be back.

1429
01:32:04,324 --> 01:32:06,958
last time, I booted
that blonde.

1430
01:32:06,959 --> 01:32:08,193
this time,
she's going to...

1431
01:32:08,194 --> 01:32:10,929
sure must be nice
to have a wife

1432
01:32:10,930 --> 01:32:13,664
that gets that mad
about you.

1433
01:32:13,766 --> 01:32:16,401
you make a good pot roast.

1434
01:32:18,871 --> 01:32:21,138
wow!

1435
01:32:26,245 --> 01:32:29,313
you may not need that
black lingerie after all.

1436
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:37,020
who'll stir the gravy

1437
01:32:37,021 --> 01:32:39,357
when I'm gone,
darlin' baby

1438
01:32:39,358 --> 01:32:42,359
who'll stir the gravy
when I'm gone

1439
01:32:42,994 --> 01:32:45,563
when I'm gone to my long,
lonesome home

1440
01:32:45,564 --> 01:32:48,431
I'm so thirsty,
I could drink water.

1441
01:32:48,767 --> 01:32:50,700
don't you ever pass out?

1442
01:32:50,701 --> 01:32:52,102
oh, liquor
don't bother me.

1443
01:32:52,103 --> 01:32:53,236
I'm going
to where the climate

1444
01:32:53,237 --> 01:32:55,505
he's going to teach her
how to sing.

1445
01:32:55,506 --> 01:32:58,241
I bet she could
learn real good, too.

1446
01:32:58,242 --> 01:33:01,278
when I'm gone to
my long, lonesome home

1447
01:33:01,279 --> 01:33:03,045
hi, Jeff. jump in.

1448
01:33:03,046 --> 01:33:04,046
hi, louise.

1449
01:33:04,047 --> 01:33:05,081
hi, ginny.

1450
01:33:05,082 --> 01:33:07,116
hi. hello, alice.

1451
01:33:07,117 --> 01:33:08,084
howdy, booker.

1452
01:33:08,085 --> 01:33:11,319
who'll hoe the corn when
I'm gone, darlin' baby

1453
01:33:12,489 --> 01:33:14,190
who'll hoe the corn

1454
01:33:14,191 --> 01:33:15,257
glad you showed up.

1455
01:33:15,258 --> 01:33:17,994
ain't you going
to kiss the bride?

1456
01:33:17,995 --> 01:33:19,495
who's the lucky girl?

1457
01:33:19,496 --> 01:33:20,196
me.

1458
01:33:20,197 --> 01:33:23,231
rosemary and al got hitched
about an hour ago.

1459
01:33:24,134 --> 01:33:24,800
really, al?

1460
01:33:24,801 --> 01:33:27,436
I got the papers
and everything.

1461
01:33:27,437 --> 01:33:28,937
how about
a real kiss now?

1462
01:33:28,938 --> 01:33:30,772
better talk
to your husband about that.

1463
01:33:30,773 --> 01:33:33,941
go ahead. you kiss
a man's bride, it means goodbye.

1464
01:33:34,878 --> 01:33:37,344
goodbye, honey.

1465
01:33:39,315 --> 01:33:40,182
hi, louise.

1466
01:33:40,183 --> 01:33:43,118
I'm goin' to where
the chilly winds

1467
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:45,086
don't blow,
darlin' baby...

1468
01:33:45,087 --> 01:33:47,888
come on.
have a drink with us.

1469
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:50,192
any gin left?

1470
01:33:50,193 --> 01:33:50,858
sure, Wes.

1471
01:33:50,859 --> 01:33:53,593
don't save it, man.
pour it.

1472
01:33:56,798 --> 01:33:59,600
who's going to be
champion bull rider this year?

1473
01:33:59,601 --> 01:34:00,635
why, you, honey.

1474
01:34:03,604 --> 01:34:04,872
who can
bronc-ride longer,

1475
01:34:04,873 --> 01:34:08,107
bulldog better,
calf-rope quicker than any man here?

1476
01:34:08,176 --> 01:34:09,210
you, honey.

1477
01:34:09,211 --> 01:34:10,044
thanks.

1478
01:34:10,045 --> 01:34:11,278
hey, you drinking?

1479
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:13,914
why, sure.
it's a party, isn't it?

1480
01:34:13,915 --> 01:34:16,283
here, honey.
wipe it off.

1481
01:34:16,284 --> 01:34:16,850
what?

1482
01:34:16,851 --> 01:34:18,919
you got something
on your face.

1483
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:20,987
let me, honey.

1484
01:34:20,988 --> 01:34:24,057
that's some dress
she's wearing, ain't it, louise?

1485
01:34:24,058 --> 01:34:25,358
yeah. I can't tell

1486
01:34:25,359 --> 01:34:27,827
whether she's outside
trying to get in

1487
01:34:27,828 --> 01:34:30,096
or inside
trying to get out.

1488
01:34:30,097 --> 01:34:33,131
I'll finish the repair work.
you hold this.

1489
01:34:33,633 --> 01:34:36,634
I'll bet babs thinks
you're pretty cute,

1490
01:34:37,538 --> 01:34:38,637
don't you, honey?

1491
01:34:38,638 --> 01:34:39,505
well, he is.

1492
01:34:39,506 --> 01:34:42,408
yeah, that's what he is,
all right. cute.

1493
01:34:42,409 --> 01:34:44,877
I got
a real cute husband.

1494
01:34:44,878 --> 01:34:46,946
I'll bet
babs is crazy about

1495
01:34:46,947 --> 01:34:48,180
other people's husbands.

1496
01:34:48,181 --> 01:34:48,881
who, babs?

1497
01:34:48,882 --> 01:34:51,616
oh, she's been
married twice.

1498
01:34:51,718 --> 01:34:53,385
legally?

1499
01:34:53,386 --> 01:34:55,120
there we are.
that's better.

1500
01:34:55,121 --> 01:34:58,089
now you look almost like
the man I married.

1501
01:34:59,025 --> 01:35:00,625
thank you, sugar,

1502
01:35:00,626 --> 01:35:02,494
but I can't let
every little blonde

1503
01:35:02,495 --> 01:35:04,729
kiss him just
because he's cute.

1504
01:35:04,730 --> 01:35:06,130
why not lock him up?

1505
01:35:06,131 --> 01:35:07,832
I wish I could,
but he's grown-up,

1506
01:35:07,833 --> 01:35:09,801
and he's making
a lot of money.

1507
01:35:09,802 --> 01:35:12,636
but I ought to
do something, sugar.

1508
01:35:12,638 --> 01:35:14,105
that's your problem,
honey.

1509
01:35:14,106 --> 01:35:15,172
of course it is.

1510
01:35:15,173 --> 01:35:17,975
do you think
this is a good idea?

1511
01:35:19,411 --> 01:35:20,644
look at me!

1512
01:35:20,645 --> 01:35:23,780
you look
just like a faucet. doesn't she, Wes?

1513
01:35:23,881 --> 01:35:26,749
why did you come,
to start a fight?

1514
01:35:26,751 --> 01:35:27,751
to stop you
from making

1515
01:35:27,752 --> 01:35:30,621
a bigger fool
out of yourself than you are.

1516
01:35:30,622 --> 01:35:32,222
thanks for telling me.

1517
01:35:32,223 --> 01:35:33,223
get going!

1518
01:35:33,224 --> 01:35:34,492
go on, get out!

1519
01:35:34,493 --> 01:35:35,692
this is my party!

1520
01:35:35,693 --> 01:35:38,427
I'll call
the manager! aah!

1521
01:35:39,430 --> 01:35:41,564
well, it's been
a lovely party,

1522
01:35:41,565 --> 01:35:43,900
and I've had
a lovely time.

1523
01:35:46,203 --> 01:35:49,038
this lady
just kicked us out.

1524
01:35:52,543 --> 01:35:53,709
all right, cowboy.

1525
01:35:53,710 --> 01:35:55,778
claim second money.
come on.

1526
01:35:55,779 --> 01:35:57,013
I told you once before.

1527
01:35:57,014 --> 01:35:59,948
stop sticking your nose
in my business.

1528
01:36:01,384 --> 01:36:04,418
well, I picked him real
slow and real careful.

1529
01:36:04,554 --> 01:36:07,421
I got married
for a home. I got one.

1530
01:36:07,590 --> 01:36:09,658
I wanted to get away
from working...

1531
01:36:09,659 --> 01:36:11,760
he just kissed
a little blonde.

1532
01:36:11,761 --> 01:36:12,761
it don't mean anything.

1533
01:36:12,762 --> 01:36:14,663
it won't look so terrible
tomorrow morning.

1534
01:36:14,664 --> 01:36:17,199
I wouldn't see him
tomorrow morning or any morning.

1535
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:20,335
when he sobers up,
he'll say, "honey, I'm sorry,"

1536
01:36:21,203 --> 01:36:22,804
and you'll forgive him.

1537
01:36:22,805 --> 01:36:23,672
I won't.

1538
01:36:23,673 --> 01:36:24,438
sure, you will.

1539
01:36:24,439 --> 01:36:27,342
that's a wife's profession...
forgiving her husband.

1540
01:36:27,343 --> 01:36:29,510
please help me.

1541
01:36:30,212 --> 01:36:33,246
get him away from here.
it's his only chance.

1542
01:36:33,649 --> 01:36:34,849
it's my only chance.

1543
01:36:34,850 --> 01:36:37,985
he puts on his own pants.
he buttons his own shirt.

1544
01:36:38,654 --> 01:36:41,621
if he does that,
he can run his own life.

1545
01:36:42,257 --> 01:36:43,023
but he doesn't.

1546
01:36:43,924 --> 01:36:47,025
either you beat the money,
or the money beats you.

1547
01:36:47,962 --> 01:36:50,896
that's all
you care about... the money.

1548
01:36:51,065 --> 01:36:52,465
when you're
finished with Wes,

1549
01:36:52,466 --> 01:36:54,801
you'll get yourself
another cowhand.

1550
01:36:54,802 --> 01:36:56,736
you're only thinking
of the money.

1551
01:36:56,737 --> 01:36:59,438
just a minute.
let me tell you something.

1552
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:02,307
when Wes asked me
to come into this,

1553
01:37:02,375 --> 01:37:03,442
maybe I told myself

1554
01:37:03,443 --> 01:37:06,311
that the money
was making up my mind,

1555
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:07,346
but it wasn't.

1556
01:37:07,347 --> 01:37:08,547
I was lying to myself.

1557
01:37:08,548 --> 01:37:11,716
the only thing that kept me
stringing along was you.

1558
01:37:13,886 --> 01:37:15,320
hope's a funny thing.

1559
01:37:15,321 --> 01:37:16,555
you can have it

1560
01:37:16,556 --> 01:37:19,424
even though there
ain't no reason for it.

1561
01:37:19,425 --> 01:37:22,359
you can tell me
to shut up and move on,

1562
01:37:22,962 --> 01:37:24,296
like anybody
at your door

1563
01:37:24,297 --> 01:37:27,132
trying to sell you
something you don't want.

1564
01:37:27,133 --> 01:37:28,566
I'm just
waiting to hear

1565
01:37:28,567 --> 01:37:31,535
what the lady
of the house has to say.

1566
01:37:38,944 --> 01:37:41,812
don't let Wes end up
the way you did.

1567
01:37:42,981 --> 01:37:45,949
you mean a washed-up,
beat-up bronc rider.

1568
01:37:46,651 --> 01:37:48,085
I didn't mean that.

1569
01:37:48,086 --> 01:37:49,520
all I meant was...

1570
01:37:49,521 --> 01:37:52,322
don't let him
wind up crippled.

1571
01:37:52,824 --> 01:37:55,991
that's all you
really care about is Wes, isn't it?

1572
01:38:05,069 --> 01:38:08,038
it's funny
how the people you never figure

1573
01:38:08,039 --> 01:38:09,739
ought to be together
always are.

1574
01:38:09,740 --> 01:38:12,842
all right, mrs. Merritt,
I'll go back and tell him.

1575
01:38:13,845 --> 01:38:16,812
I made my pitch.
the lady just didn't buy.

1576
01:38:16,813 --> 01:38:19,848
we'll come back here
after we close the joint.

1577
01:38:23,253 --> 01:38:26,088
I do think I ought
to kiss you just once

1578
01:38:26,089 --> 01:38:28,790
for all the times
I won't.

1579
01:38:33,730 --> 01:38:35,297
ain't that pretty,

1580
01:38:35,298 --> 01:38:38,266
out here in the corridor
playing post office?

1581
01:38:38,267 --> 01:38:40,869
somebody's going
to get real fed up with you

1582
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:43,838
and beat your
head in with a rake handle.

1583
01:38:43,839 --> 01:38:44,873
your friend?

1584
01:38:45,375 --> 01:38:47,742
be the first thing
you've done on your own

1585
01:38:47,743 --> 01:38:48,710
since I knew you.

1586
01:38:48,711 --> 01:38:51,646
you've just been dragging
your foot in my stirrup.

1587
01:38:51,647 --> 01:38:53,181
you got
anything to say,

1588
01:38:53,182 --> 01:38:54,281
say it
at the stables.

1589
01:38:54,282 --> 01:38:56,718
playing me for a sucker.
taking half my dough.

1590
01:38:56,719 --> 01:38:59,653
why? because
you ain't got guts to ride yourself.

1591
01:38:59,654 --> 01:39:02,923
all that fancy talk
about being through with rodeoeoing.

1592
01:39:03,658 --> 01:39:04,658
you'll never be through

1593
01:39:04,659 --> 01:39:07,395
as long as you ride
somebody else's shoulders.

1594
01:39:07,396 --> 01:39:08,028
you're yellow!

1595
01:39:08,029 --> 01:39:11,063
you ain't got guts enough
to ride a dead mule.

1596
01:39:14,636 --> 01:39:17,203
you bounce real good.

1597
01:39:22,711 --> 01:39:25,745
bronc riders.
I never met a bronc rider yet

1598
01:39:25,746 --> 01:39:27,647
that wasn't
a wild man.

1599
01:39:27,648 --> 01:39:29,682
but if they
weren't wild men,

1600
01:39:29,683 --> 01:39:31,418
they wouldn't
be bronc riders.

1601
01:39:31,419 --> 01:39:33,885
you still sure?

1602
01:39:35,021 --> 01:39:37,523
ginny, you keep an eye
on mrs. Merritt.

1603
01:39:37,524 --> 01:39:40,426
she'll need a place
to sleep tonight.

1604
01:39:42,496 --> 01:39:45,497
remember once a party
in butte, montana.

1605
01:39:45,531 --> 01:39:46,132
big hotel.

1606
01:39:46,133 --> 01:39:48,901
fella's wife
kissed another fella,

1607
01:39:48,902 --> 01:39:51,402
and this fella...

1608
01:40:05,251 --> 01:40:07,285
once again,
it's my pleasure

1609
01:40:07,286 --> 01:40:08,186
to describe to you

1610
01:40:08,187 --> 01:40:10,756
an outstanding event
in the world of sports...

1611
01:40:10,757 --> 01:40:12,323
the annual
pendleton roundup.

1612
01:40:12,324 --> 01:40:13,591
passing before us now,

1613
01:40:13,592 --> 01:40:15,927
an exciting display
of old glory,

1614
01:40:15,928 --> 01:40:18,663
followed by our friends
the yumatella indians.

1615
01:40:18,664 --> 01:40:20,465
adding more color
to this review,

1616
01:40:20,466 --> 01:40:23,268
the serpentine ride
by the cowboy contestants

1617
01:40:23,269 --> 01:40:25,102
in the center
of the arena.

1618
01:40:42,853 --> 01:40:44,788
what do you say,
bobby?

1619
01:40:44,789 --> 01:40:46,423
you sweetening up
the kitty?

1620
01:40:46,424 --> 01:40:47,791
get off his back.

1621
01:40:47,792 --> 01:40:49,326
you might ride
for second.

1622
01:40:49,327 --> 01:40:51,927
well, I'm just kidding.

1623
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,400
what do you think
you're doing?

1624
01:40:58,401 --> 01:41:00,003
what's it look like?

1625
01:41:00,004 --> 01:41:01,137
signing up, huh?

1626
01:41:01,138 --> 01:41:03,807
calf roping, steer
tying, bulldogging,

1627
01:41:03,808 --> 01:41:04,673
bareback,
and saddle bronc.

1628
01:41:04,674 --> 01:41:07,608
everything
but ladies' trick riding.

1629
01:41:08,845 --> 01:41:11,380
I owe you
$350 entry fee.

1630
01:41:11,381 --> 01:41:12,215
just a minute, Jeff.

1631
01:41:12,216 --> 01:41:15,416
you letting
this ruckus with Wes get under your skin.

1632
01:41:16,118 --> 01:41:17,386
that's my business,
gentlemen.

1633
01:41:17,387 --> 01:41:18,454
let's talk this over.

1634
01:41:18,455 --> 01:41:21,622
take that money
and hand me one of those numbers.

1635
01:41:34,337 --> 01:41:36,003
you out
of your head?

1636
01:41:36,004 --> 01:41:37,672
you ain't
rodeoed all season.

1637
01:41:37,673 --> 01:41:39,640
you're
in no condition to compete.

1638
01:41:39,641 --> 01:41:42,443
the only thing
you've got to worry about

1639
01:41:42,444 --> 01:41:45,211
is keeping
those chutes loaded.

1640
01:42:17,677 --> 01:42:19,913
wouldn't let
nobody use them but you.

1641
01:42:19,914 --> 01:42:22,848
won the average
four years at calgary with them.

1642
01:42:22,849 --> 01:42:26,051
set a record
they been shooting at for 20 years...9.3.

1643
01:42:27,187 --> 01:42:29,555
I'll be satisfied
with 14 flat.

1644
01:42:29,556 --> 01:42:32,024
I hear you've signed up
for four events.

1645
01:42:32,025 --> 01:42:34,527
quit yapping.
ain't nobody in your class.

1646
01:42:34,528 --> 01:42:37,195
now we're going to see
some records broke.

1647
01:42:37,196 --> 01:42:39,564
but you ain't
competed all year.

1648
01:42:39,565 --> 01:42:42,499
honey, I got told
two things yesterday.

1649
01:42:43,736 --> 01:42:47,004
one was to keep my nose
out of other people's business.

1650
01:42:47,573 --> 01:42:50,507
that's pretty good advice
all around.

1651
01:43:01,854 --> 01:43:03,121
our first contestant
in calf roping

1652
01:43:03,122 --> 01:43:05,824
will be Jeff mccloud
of bandera, texas.

1653
01:43:05,825 --> 01:43:06,958
Jeff's making
his first appearance

1654
01:43:06,959 --> 01:43:09,961
after a year's layoff
because of a leg injury.

1655
01:43:09,962 --> 01:43:12,963
I'm sure rodeo contestants
and rodeo fans alike

1656
01:43:12,964 --> 01:43:16,166
are happy to welcome Jeff
back to competition.

1657
01:43:32,183 --> 01:43:34,217
guess he's
a little overanxious,

1658
01:43:34,218 --> 01:43:37,319
but he's going to try
for a second throw.

1659
01:43:59,942 --> 01:44:01,943
you're going away.

1660
01:44:01,944 --> 01:44:03,812
because of Wes?

1661
01:44:03,813 --> 01:44:05,814
no, honey,
because of me.

1662
01:44:05,815 --> 01:44:07,916
did you hear about Jeff?

1663
01:44:07,917 --> 01:44:09,485
no. did he leave?

1664
01:44:09,486 --> 01:44:10,819
I wish he had.

1665
01:44:10,820 --> 01:44:12,286
he's going
to rodeo today.

1666
01:44:12,287 --> 01:44:13,955
he signed up
for four events.

1667
01:44:13,956 --> 01:44:16,758
no matter
what booker says, he ain't in shape.

1668
01:44:16,759 --> 01:44:18,592
everybody knows it
but Jeff.

1669
01:44:18,593 --> 01:44:21,594
they say
he's just doing it to show Wes.

1670
01:44:23,332 --> 01:44:24,965
no, that isn't it.

1671
01:44:24,966 --> 01:44:27,934
maybe it's because
he needs the day money.

1672
01:44:28,637 --> 01:44:31,271
that isn't it,
either.

1673
01:44:31,473 --> 01:44:32,840
where is he?

1674
01:44:32,841 --> 01:44:34,742
over at the chutes.

1675
01:44:34,743 --> 01:44:37,744
Wes Merritt
of big springs, texas.

1676
01:44:51,059 --> 01:44:54,126
the time for Wes Merritt
is 21.4 seconds.

1677
01:44:54,895 --> 01:44:58,096
it looks like Jeff mccloud
is going all the way.

1678
01:44:58,265 --> 01:45:01,132
he's next up
in bulldogging,

1679
01:45:01,168 --> 01:45:03,402
and he's chosen
for his hazer

1680
01:45:03,403 --> 01:45:04,570
a lifelong friend

1681
01:45:04,571 --> 01:45:07,639
and old-time rodeo great
of past years,

1682
01:45:08,008 --> 01:45:09,242
booker davis.

1683
01:45:09,243 --> 01:45:10,309
man be in trouble

1684
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:12,178
if he front-holds
a steer this big.

1685
01:45:12,179 --> 01:45:15,180
I reckon I'll throw him
with a half nelson.

1686
01:45:15,315 --> 01:45:18,083
have him in shape
to throw him right.

1687
01:45:18,084 --> 01:45:21,085
if I have to,
I'll bump him in your lap.

1688
01:45:37,303 --> 01:45:40,170
Jeff's time...
11.6 seconds.

1689
01:45:44,142 --> 01:45:46,176
sure bedded him down
in a hurry.

1690
01:45:46,177 --> 01:45:48,546
that's good enough
for day money.

1691
01:45:48,547 --> 01:45:51,482
you had him in there
all the way for me.

1692
01:45:52,618 --> 01:45:53,550
to the chutes now

1693
01:45:53,551 --> 01:45:54,719
for the saddle bronc
riding.

1694
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:55,686
our first contestant,

1695
01:45:55,687 --> 01:45:58,687
bob elliott
of newhall, california.

1696
01:46:04,062 --> 01:46:05,895
next out, Wes Merritt.

1697
01:46:05,896 --> 01:46:07,130
Wes will try his hand

1698
01:46:07,131 --> 01:46:10,333
on one of al dawson's
top broncs...black widow.

1699
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:31,053
over to chute 8,
where Pete fox

1700
01:46:31,054 --> 01:46:32,688
from rapid city,
south dakota,

1701
01:46:32,689 --> 01:46:35,557
is coming out
on war paint.

1702
01:46:40,564 --> 01:46:41,697
looks like war paint

1703
01:46:41,698 --> 01:46:43,932
is really
on the warpath today.

1704
01:46:43,933 --> 01:46:46,500
tough break, Pete.

1705
01:46:50,439 --> 01:46:53,574
I think red
just stayed out too late last night.

1706
01:46:54,710 --> 01:46:57,345
oh, he did
pretty good.

1707
01:46:57,480 --> 01:47:00,314
hear you entered in
the saddle bronc riding.

1708
01:47:00,315 --> 01:47:01,783
well, you heard right.

1709
01:47:01,784 --> 01:47:03,451
picked a tough horse.

1710
01:47:03,452 --> 01:47:06,320
I remember saying
the same thing to Wes.

1711
01:47:06,321 --> 01:47:08,122
I can handle
anything he can.

1712
01:47:08,123 --> 01:47:11,091
everybody knows Wes
ain't in your class.

1713
01:47:11,593 --> 01:47:12,894
everybody but me.

1714
01:47:12,895 --> 01:47:13,928
now to chute number 6,

1715
01:47:13,929 --> 01:47:15,762
where Jeff mccloud
of bandera, texas,

1716
01:47:15,763 --> 01:47:18,432
the former saddle bronc
champion of the world,

1717
01:47:18,433 --> 01:47:21,601
will come out on a horse
called lightning rod.

1718
01:47:40,821 --> 01:47:43,389
all right. let me out.

1719
01:47:56,670 --> 01:47:59,004
look at that cowboy stick!

1720
01:47:59,005 --> 01:48:01,505
a great ride.

1721
01:48:05,011 --> 01:48:06,412
he's the best.

1722
01:48:06,413 --> 01:48:08,946
he's much of a man.

1723
01:48:10,350 --> 01:48:11,217
our pickup men

1724
01:48:11,218 --> 01:48:14,352
seem to be having trouble
getting to Jeff.

1725
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:17,656
Jeff mccloud
is in trouble.

1726
01:48:20,325 --> 01:48:23,460
and he's got his foot
caught in the stirrup.

1727
01:48:43,014 --> 01:48:46,282
at chute 2, craig bentley
of salinas, california,

1728
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:49,452
is coming out
on the drifter.

1729
01:49:01,865 --> 01:49:03,866
in here, boys.

1730
01:49:03,867 --> 01:49:05,401
out of chute number 2,

1731
01:49:05,402 --> 01:49:08,369
Wes Merritt,
big springs, texas.

1732
01:49:14,778 --> 01:49:17,578
come on, Wes.
you're next out.

1733
01:49:35,464 --> 01:49:38,232
what were you
trying to prove?

1734
01:49:43,305 --> 01:49:45,540
I used to make
my own money.

1735
01:49:45,541 --> 01:49:48,542
I used buy my own whiskey,
take my own falls.

1736
01:49:49,978 --> 01:49:53,046
a fella just likes to know
if he can still do it.

1737
01:49:55,050 --> 01:49:58,051
isn't one man enough
for you to worry about?

1738
01:49:58,987 --> 01:50:00,821
he ain't bad hurt.

1739
01:50:00,822 --> 01:50:02,622
he's showing
how tough he is.

1740
01:50:02,623 --> 01:50:04,892
broken rib. that's nothing.
I remember...

1741
01:50:04,893 --> 01:50:06,527
I told you
to lay still.

1742
01:50:07,695 --> 01:50:10,629
that rib's
sticking through his lung.

1743
01:50:12,132 --> 01:50:15,133
you're nothing
but a no-good, washed-out,

1744
01:50:15,470 --> 01:50:17,136
beat-up bronc rider.

1745
01:50:17,137 --> 01:50:19,972
all you know is
how to bust a gut.

1746
01:50:20,407 --> 01:50:21,941
the more bones
you break,

1747
01:50:21,942 --> 01:50:24,744
the bigger man
you think you are.

1748
01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:37,155
broken bones,
broken bottles, broken everything.

1749
01:50:38,358 --> 01:50:41,393
there never was a bronc
that couldn't be rode.

1750
01:50:42,996 --> 01:50:46,097
there never was a cowboy
that couldn't be throwed.

1751
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:49,600
guys like me
last forever.

1752
01:51:23,901 --> 01:51:26,336
where's Jeff?

1753
01:51:27,071 --> 01:51:29,439
he's dead.

1754
01:51:35,847 --> 01:51:38,214

1758
01:52:01,905 --> 01:52:04,939

two extra hands, could you?

1759
01:52:11,614 --> 01:52:14,015
sure, booker.

1760
01:52:15,017 --> 01:52:17,985
