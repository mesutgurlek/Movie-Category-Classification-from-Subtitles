1
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,200
Jeremiah !
Jeremiah Pit !

2
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,100
Hello Sir Captain!
Do you need anything?

3
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,000
What do you mean "sir captain"?
What do you want to say with that?

4
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,100
You don't recognize me? I am..
Yes... sure...

5
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,100
We have met at "El Passo",
7-8 years ago if I'm not wrong.

6
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,100
The time is passing and there are
so many things happening.

7
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,800
People can not remember everything.

8
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,100
Do you want to drink something sir captain?

9
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,700
Where are you going?

10
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,100
To the South.

11
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,700
Is there any village nearby where
I can spend the night?

12
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,100
There is Mimbres, less than
an hour from here.

13
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,400
But there are no hotels
for one like you sir.

14
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,800
Mimbres...

15
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,400
I have met someone who
stayed at Mimbres.

16
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,900
I think his name is Brown.
Montgomery Brown.

17
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,400
But he is called Ringo.
Do you know him?

18
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Montgomery Brown.

19
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,100
Of course I know him!

20
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,500
But he is not back sir captain!
He went to the war and never came back!

21
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,600
Who knows what happened to him?

22
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,000
He has not returned yet?
If I am not wrong, he was married.

23
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Maybe the wife would love...

24
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,100
...to talk to someone who has
met her husband.

25
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,000
Who knows, maybe she will permit me to
stay over night at her house.

26
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,700
As long as there are no hotels
in Mimbres.

27
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,600
Brown's wife's name is Hally,
isn't it?

28
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,300
Who are they?
Why they wanted to kill me?

29
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,100
They are Paco Fuentes's men.

30
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,000
He and his brothers came to Mimbres
since they discovered gold in the lake.

31
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
They say it is Mexican land and
no one wants to contradict them.

32
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,700
What happened to Hally?

33
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Peace!

34
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,200
I need your herbs to cure
a friend of mine.

35
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,200
You said you need it for a friend.

36
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,100
It is not allowed to enter with dogs,
Americans or beggers.

37
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,200
There's a man on the street.
He might need help.

38
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,900
He doesn't need help.
- He needs a mortician (corpse puller).

39
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,900
Hey, you! Where are you coming from?
- An Indian? From the mountains sir!

40
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,900
Are you looking for a job?
Not today, today I have eaten.

41
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,300
What are you, an American,
Indian or Mexican ?

42
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,700
How could he know?

43
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,400
So many people entered his house,
even his mother doesn't know what he is!

44
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,600
Welcome to Mimbers, my friend!

45
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,700
What kind of work do you want, my friend?

46
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
To have enough to live but
not to get too tired.

47
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,800
Then go to Fuentes.
They are in Brown's house.

48
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,900
Now they are the owners.
They command now.

49
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,300
If you know how to kill,
they will hire you at once.

50
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,300
But I don't know how to shoot Sheriff!
- Then learn!

51
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,700
You must learn to handle a gun if
you want to survive here!

52
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,900
Just an advise you need to remember!

53
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,300
But you have lived long,
even without a gun!

54
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,500
My case is totally different,
I am not a Mexican.

55
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,300
I am an American, an inferior race.

56
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,900
And we, the inferior races,
we can survive even if we have no gun.

57
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,100
What are you looking for?

58
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,700
Some job.

59
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,700
The Sherriff told me to ask
the Fuentes' brothers.

60
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,400
Ask for a job?
You changed your mind so fast?

61
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,400
No, I did not change my mind...
I just got hungry!

62
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,600
So you are hungry?

63
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,000
Eat then!

64
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,900
Eat, eat!

65
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,400
Hey Hobo! Go now!
I want to see no Hobo here!

66
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,700
My name is "do not forget me"
or Myossothis, for friends.

67
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,300
Last night I thought they will die
so I kept a watch on them all night.

68
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,400
Now they are ok.
Do you like flowers?

69
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,400
I have created this species.
Brown roses.

70
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,200
It's the name of the masters from Mimbres...
once upon a time.

71
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,300
I owe them everything,
and Mrs Hally let me take care of them.

72
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,700
Are you passing by here?
Yes, but will stay for a little while.

73
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,500
Just for a little while?
At Mimbres?

74
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,600
You like flowers and you walk in
Mimbers without a pistol?

75
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,100
I think you are crazy.
Where do you want to stay?

76
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,400
You can help me if I don't find
something else.

77
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,200
There's nothing good at Mimbres.
You could help me. There's always something to do.

78
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,200
You remind me of someone…
This is what happen with strangers.

79
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,700
They always looking like someone but
no one looks like them.

80
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,300
Look at these flowers! I can't leave them for
two minutes, they start to lay down.

81
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,600
They need company
I will tell you a story...

82
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,900
Good bye!

83
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,200
Hello sir Myosothis !
Hello, Rosita !

84
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,400
Look, your rose awaits you!

85
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,300
What a nice man!

86
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,800
Who are you?

87
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,300
I have never seen you before.

88
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,900
I'm Myosothis'  cousin...
I came this morning.

89
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,400
A distant relative...

90
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,300
Come visit me.
I'd like to foretell your future.

91
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,000
I'll tell about the beautiful present you live in and
I will tell you about your future too.

92
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,700
What do you want more from life?

93
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,900
Now I know who you remind me of!

94
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
My uncle, Alfonso.

95
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You look familiar...
- You mean what, we're relatives?

96
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,600
Come on in! I'll explain to you later.
- Excuse me!

97
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,800
I am sorry, but I have to make
a nice funeral crown.

98
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,400
For the judge that they killed.
Someone has to remember him.

99
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,500
Good night!

100
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,700
Help me! I need to make a nice funeral crown
for an important man.

101
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,100
He was killed by people
who wanted to be important.

102
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,300
Ok boss!

103
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,900
I'll forgive your sins in the name of
Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

104
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,300
Bravo !

105
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
But you haven't written anything on the crown.

106
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
Put it there.

107
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,800
May God be with you

108
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,400
Don't go anywhere!

109
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,900
That's it!

110
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,800
I know you have found a job.

111
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,200
I told you about the Fuentes brothers, but
you chose to be Myosothis' slave.

112
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,700
You can't tell you have a lot of imagination.

113
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,700
I'm new in this town and
I could make a mistake.

114
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,400
Nobody likes to die, Sherriff.

115
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,500
But one who is afraid of death
could die little by little many times.

116
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,800
And one who is not afraid of death,
dies only once.

117
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,600
I'm not armed!
You can't shoot at a man who doesen't have a gun.

118
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,800
How does the story begin?

119
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,300
Somebody found gold in the river.

120
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,700
Then everybody came to know.
You know how it is when it is about gold.

121
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,200
Men are coming from far away,
These men have come from Mexico.

122
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,100
Anyway it is near.

123
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,800
Why nobody told nothing?
Because they are scared. Don't you know what fear is?

124
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,900
Of course! they are scared.
That's it for now.

125
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,200
But before the Mexicans came,
why no one fought back?

126
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,200
Who knows?
All the young men were at the war.

127
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,200
The war is over and no one's back yet
not even the people who announced it.

128
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,500
They're waiting at the entry point of
the village to kill them one by one .

129
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,900
Only the old people were at Mimbres
and only a few of them could fight back.

130
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,300
The first it was the senator Brown
and the last one was the judge Barnes.

131
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,800
You've seen how they all ended up.

132
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,400
They killed senator Brown?

133
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,100
They said he died of heart attack.

134
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,200
But you are always hurt when you have
a bullet in your heart.

135
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,100
Poor senator...
At least his son would have come back.

136
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,400
Maybe it's better he had not returned.

137
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Maybe it's better this way.

138
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,100
Why do you say so?

139
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,500
He was married, and its better for a
a husband, not to see some things.

140
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,000
Good night!

141
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,200
My dear, I told you not to get far
from the carriage.

142
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,900
Yes, mama.

143
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,300
No body offers to drink?

144
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,400
Don't you want to make love?

145
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,600
It is an offer...

146
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
If a man doesen't want to make love,

147
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,900
It means that either he has just
made it or he is in love.

148
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,800
Let's see…

149
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,200
Let's see, who you are in love with.

150
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,300
The cards never lie.
They are not like men.

151
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,800
Esteban, that man has insulted me.

152
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,800
Estaban, wait!
What do you want to do with a dead man?

153
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,900
If you kill him,
we cannot have fun anymore.

154
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:38,300
A man can be killed only once.
But you can have fun with him everyday.

155
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,583
The Sherriff helped me bring you here.

156
00:34:09,696 --> 00:34:13,537
Myosothis would have got a heart attack
if he had seen you like this.

157
00:34:14,984 --> 00:34:21,244
You are a strange man. Esteban almost killed you,
but you were not afraid.

158
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,159
You were not scared at all.

159
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:27,092
I don't like people who don't get scared.

160
00:34:28,502 --> 00:34:30,960
You are not scared, you get kicked
and you wear a gun under the shirt.

161
00:34:34,617 --> 00:34:39,001
I'd like to fortell your future.

162
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,224
Your gun is in the drawer.
You can take it if you want to.

163
00:34:42,224 --> 00:34:48,267
Sleep here, take the gun in the morning.
Need not make love if you don't want to.

164
00:35:34,926 --> 00:35:38,366
Finally, I see you again!
Where the hell you slept last night?

165
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:46,293
In a drain? Why?
I'll explain you later.

166
00:35:46,766 --> 00:35:49,153
But that dead man?
Who is that dead man?

167
00:35:50,766 --> 00:35:55,645
Don't you know? He is Montgomery Brown.
He is Ringo. The senator's son. He is back.

168
00:35:56,452 --> 00:35:58,358
Ok. move it.
We have work to do.

169
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,355
Paco Fuentes wants many flowers
for the funeral!

170
00:36:08,400 --> 00:37:12,390
Captain, Montgomery Brown
died for his country.

171
00:38:01,474 --> 00:38:09,300
Montgomery Brown is dead.
It is over now with him.

172
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,400
He may rest in peace,
as we may live.

173
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:36,272
As the gospel said, we burn in land
and in land we return.

174
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,670
Thank you Myosothis!
These are wonderful flowers.

175
00:41:08,455 --> 00:41:10,667
I'm glad that you like them, my dear!

176
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,741
I'm happy with you and Myosothis.
You've done a good job.

177
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:25,700
You and your assistance may stay
for the party at the villa tonight.

178
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:05,300
Father, I need you.
I want you to marry us this Sunday.

179
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,400
Poor captain Brown couldn't be
saved from death.

180
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,800
We have no reason to delay the wedding.
we've waited long enough.

181
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,500
Isn't it, my dear?

182
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:49,940
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

183
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:56,900
7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.

184
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,500
Who are you?
And what are you doing here?

185
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,250
Hally!
Hally, where are you?

186
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:53,000
The guests want to see you my dear,
and I want you to stand next to me.

187
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,600
I can't stay away from you.

188
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,400
Let's go.

189
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:45,400
Paco did you send somebody to the office?
To the office? No!

190
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:49,300
Maybe he is a curious guest!
I don't like curious people!

191
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,200
Let's see!

192
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,700
If I were in your shoes,
I would not run away.

193
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,900
Wait, my friend!

194
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:28,900
Look what our gardener does!
You decided to get rich so fast?

195
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:13,600
Once they used to cut right hand of the thieves.
We have to respect the old traditions.

196
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:22,300
But today it's a holy day so I've
decided to forgive you.

197
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,100
Welcome to my house!

198
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,800
I want to sort flowers for the church...

199
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
...it is Sunday after 3 days.

200
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:34,700
Is he in the house?
Of course, he is in the house!

201
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,400
What's my daughter's name?
- Elizabeth, as your mother's name.

202
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I had to leave her home,
I am allowed to get away with her.

203
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:47,300
You have to take her tonight, I'll wait for you
with the horses at the cemetery.

204
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Before they realize that you are gone,
we will be already far from here.

205
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:53,800
You want to run away?

206
00:51:57,350 --> 00:52:00,000
All that I've had for all these years,
was it unseless?

207
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,500
Useless?
Why?

208
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,500
You've waited for me.
We can live together again.

209
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:10,000
Everybody in the village has waited,
they all have to live again too.

210
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,550
They are dead already.
The fear has killed them.

211
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,675
That's not true. They are not dead.

212
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,900
They will die if you abandoned them.

213
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:23,800
Listen Hally, count the mexicans. How many are there?
How many are in the house?

214
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,800
What can I do about myself?
Look! What they have done to me?

215
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,199
You never ever asked me this whole time,
if between me and Paco… ?

216
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,600
What does it matter?
- It matters to me!

217
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,900
I want you to know...
Now you know!

218
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,990
You said at the cemetery?
Tonight?

219
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,800
Not tonight.

220
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:58,700
First I have to get myself prepared.
Myosothis will tell you when?

221
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,990
You came to see me,
or get your future told?

222
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,200
How many questions for a fortune teller…

223
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,700
Past or future?
- I know my past.

224
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:26,200
How ironic! How things can change
in just couple of days.

225
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,900
Has my future changed?
- No, you have changed!

226
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,000
A man who has no fear, has no hope.

227
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,500
One who hopes, can hope an interesting tomorrow.

228
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:45,300
Who has hope, has fear too. See?
Now you are scared.

229
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,200
Just a moment please!

230
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:09,500
I have not told you your future yet.
- It doesent matter, I know it already.

231
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,400
I've earned some money these days and
I would like to earn some more.

232
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,000
It didn't go so well for you, grand father.

233
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,300
No shit!
You've cheated!

234
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,100
Excuse me?

235
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:14,400
I can see very clearly.
You are a damn cheater!

236
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,400
Have I heard well grand father?
-You heard very well!

237
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:22,900
If this two men weren't cheaters and thieves as
you are, they would confess...

238
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,500
Why don't you arrest them, Sheriff?

239
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:32,000
Its not allowed to cheat in this village.

240
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,000
You represent the inferiors here.

241
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,000
But perhaps this means nothing
to a person like you.

242
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,200
Isn't it Carson?

243
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,700
I got it!
You want me to take care of this.

244
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,700
In the name of our Sheriff, the inferior,
I will arrest you!

245
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,440
See Sheriff, its not that difficult,
you only need to want this!

246
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,500
I can help you if you want them
to be put in jail.

247
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:13,500
Who are you?
I'll explain this later Sheriff.

248
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Montgomery Brown...

249
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:27,600
Esteban will not come tonight.

250
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,300
Will you stay?

251
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,700
The Sheriff has arrested him.

252
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:37,500
He cheated with cards and
the Sheriff  has put him in jail.

253
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Myosothis helped him.

254
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
When Paco will find out, he will take care of
the Sheriff and Myosothis.

255
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,200
He need not know that.

256
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:53,500
Tell Juan and someone from the group.

257
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,700
It will be enough for them to be there and
convince the Sheriff to let them go.

258
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:05,700
It won't be so hard for you to convince
Esteban to get over this.

259
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,800
Poor Sheriff and poor Myosothis!

260
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,600
I wouldn't like if anything bad
happens to them.

261
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:18,660
When Paco Fuentes finds out about it...
- he will take a revenge.

262
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,400
You will have to take care if
you don't want to be killed.

263
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,000
Do you have any idea how many
brothers Fuentes have?

264
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:29,300
I will repost ,very well!
- And you must repost as well.

265
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,000
Very good! Who is the 3rd one, Myosothis?
Ok, he will repost as well. So what?

266
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,600
This is crazy.
I know!

267
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:41,500
What are you looking for?

268
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:47,500
Dynamite!
You have it?

269
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,200
It belongs to judge Barnes,
isn't it?

270
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,600
You need to change the atmosphere
in this office, Sherriff.

271
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,300
Sheriff, come, come out!

272
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,900
What a bravery, Sheriff!

273
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,500
I pray that Esteban won't get
mad at you.

274
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,600
Let him be free now.
- I'm sorry for you.

275
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,600
There's nothing more to do, my friends.

276
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:09,800
Esteban will stay in the jail till
the judgement day. Is it clear?

277
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,700
We have to to burry them.
- Not now, Myosothis, later on.

278
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,900
But…
- I'll explain it to you later.

279
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,700
What are you doing?

280
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,800
What's that?
Dynamite!

281
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:19,200
Wait!

282
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:26,700
With your permission, let me give you my
regards to you for the wedding.

283
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,800
The church is ready, and this is
for decorating the house.

284
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,700
Take care of your friend,
don't steal anything.

285
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,800
Oh, I forgot…
Esteban and the others will stay in the village.

286
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,750
They will organise a party for you.

287
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,000
Let's hurry up!

288
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
We wil have them at the door.

289
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,000
Flowers at the entrance will
always make you feel good.

290
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,600
We will put others inside.

291
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:18,800
Im sorry sir Paco…!

292
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,400
It's about the whole family.
It's a delicate case.

293
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:24,150
If you want, we can cancel
the ceremony till tomorrow.

294
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,000
I don't cancel anything!

295
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:59,100
Don't move from here, ok?
You promise me. Please…Ok!

296
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:49,500
Hello!

297
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:53,200
Hey You! What are you doing with that cartridge box?

298
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:02,000
We are here to celebrate
Sir Francisco Fuentes's wedding.

299
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:03,500
Our noble bracing.

300
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:10,600
With Hally Fitzgerald, the widow of
captain Montgomery Brown.

301
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,200
Esteban !
Esteban !

302
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,800
Rosita, finally!
Get us out of here!

303
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:58,000
Francisco Fuentes, do you take Hally Fitzgerald
to be your wife?

304
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,800
As per the norms of Romano-Catholic church?

305
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:04,400
Yes.

306
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,500
Hally Fitzgerald, do you want to take
Francisco Fuentes to be your husband?

307
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:14,900
As per the norms of Romano-Catholic church?

308
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:21,900
Elizabeth is waiting for you, my dear.

309
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:32,000
I pronounce you now man and wife…

310
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,400
I am back, Paco Fuentes!

311
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,300
I am back!

312
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:00,500
I am back!

313
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,200
I am back!

314
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,500
The horses!
They are gone!

315
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,800
Hally !
Hally !

316
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,200
Why did you do that?
You didn't have to… you promised me that… !

317
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:18,600
Let's go!

318
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:23,500
He died only because of me.

319
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,700
We all can be wrong. We all can be...

320
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:06,400
You don't have to be scared any more.
Now you can choose.

321
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,900
You can fight to live or to die.

322
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,600
What can we do?

323
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,000
Take the guns and I'll let you know.

324
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Hello!
Hi!

325
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:07,500
Move it!

326
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,300
Come!

327
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,700
Let's go upstair!
Ok, sir!

328
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,900
Don't call me sir,
call me dad.

329
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:12,800
What do you mean father?
Elizabeth will let you know later on.

330
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:14,700
Ok, dad!

331
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,800
May I help you, dad?

332
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:25,600
Nice shot dad!

333
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,800
Play with this now,
and stay hiding.

334
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,400
Whatever happens, just don't move!

335
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:42,200
Sure dad, otherwise they will catch me
and then you can't do nothing.

336
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:43,500
Am I right?
