You've already lost

117

I don't want to risk another.

118
00:08:42,766 --> 00:08:44,534
I don't have a man in this house.

119

Then let's get to it.

125

Mr. Parcher's lived

this country could throw at him.

You stay close and mind him.

128
00:09:14,432 --> 00:09:16,932
You'll be fine.

No.

Good.

137
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:01,609
I wonder

138
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:03,977
what kind of weapon
makes a wound like that.

139

<i>No scalping knife I know of.</i>

140
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,351
<i>Maybe some kind of chisel.</i>

141
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:46,050
That gun only fires twice.

142
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:50,355
He would have had
to have reloaded it

143

if he wanted to kill everybody.

144
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:57,963
Any Christian woman would
prefer dying to capture.

145
00:10:57,965 --> 00:11:01,549
Mr. Williams had time to reload

146
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:04,335
because his wife gave it to him.

147
00:11:04,337 --> 00:11:07,688
If it came to that,

148
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,457
I hope you'd be strong enough

149
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:12,025
to take care of your mother.

150
00:11:30,594 --> 00:11:33,996
I suppose a wild buffalo
could have done this.

151
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:40,754
Looks like you've found yourself
a hole in the ground there, will.

152

That and four corpses

How long have the
Indians had them?

160
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:00,556
Near a day now.

161
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:03,225
Mm, well,

162
00:12:03,227 --> 00:12:05,727
that's more than enough time for
those women to have been...

Yes, so why aren't
