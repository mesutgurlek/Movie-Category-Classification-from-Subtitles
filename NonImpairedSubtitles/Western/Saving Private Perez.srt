1
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,466
What do you want?

2
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,162
Ma...

3
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:17,538
You aren't my son.

4
00:04:19,206 --> 00:04:22,265
You haven't been my son for a long time.

5
00:04:33,782 --> 00:04:35,544
Why are you here, Ma?

6
00:04:36,518 --> 00:04:38,213
You don't deserve this.

7
00:04:39,786 --> 00:04:44,915
l'd rather rot in here
than live among real rats.

8
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:56,922
And my brother?

9
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:59,792
Where's Juan?

10
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:05,060
-They can't find him.
-What?

11
00:05:06,203 --> 00:05:07,932
They don't know anything.

12
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,368
They won't tell me anything.

13
00:05:11,973 --> 00:05:15,430
Why did he become a soldier?
Why did you let him go, Ma?

14
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,170
How long has he been missing, Ma?

15
00:05:39,158 --> 00:05:43,490
Everybody says you're
the most powerful man in Mexico.

16
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:46,928
They say you're unstoppable.

17
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:49,460
lf that's true,

18
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,190
and if you want my forgiveness,

19
00:05:55,702 --> 00:05:58,329
there's only one thing you can do,

20
00:06:00,338 --> 00:06:02,066
Julian Perez.

21
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,137
Anything, just ask.

22
00:06:15,582 --> 00:06:17,845
Bring my Juan back.

23
00:06:20,885 --> 00:06:22,078
Alive.

24
00:06:26,722 --> 00:06:32,521
SAVlNG PRlVATE PEREZ

25
00:07:28,928 --> 00:07:30,020
Well,

26
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:32,457
first of all,

27
00:07:33,864 --> 00:07:35,957
where the hell is lraq?

28
00:07:40,035 --> 00:07:42,195
Julian, gentlemen...

29
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:52,703
lraq, its neighboring countries
Kuwait, Turkey,

30
00:07:52,877 --> 00:07:55,071
Saudi Arabia and lran.

31
00:07:55,245 --> 00:07:57,678
Russia and Afghanistan are up north.

32
00:07:57,813 --> 00:08:00,372
Even before the Gulf War,
lraq was considered one

33
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:02,472
of the most dangerous areas in the world.

34
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:03,982
Eladio, get to the point, man.

35
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:08,247
Forget the history lesson,
and let's get down to business.

36
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:19,853
This is the area where
Private Juan Perez was last seen.

37
00:08:20,094 --> 00:08:24,085
His squad was hit by a car bomb, occurring

38
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:27,197
at 1500 hrs on May 1 2th, 2003.

39
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:30,495
The American Army
has classified Private Perez

40
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:32,591
as missing in action.

41
00:08:41,675 --> 00:08:42,972
Okay.

42
00:08:43,642 --> 00:08:44,939
Here's the deal.

43
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:49,674
l'm gonna need you to assemble
a small team of men

44
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,738
to get me in and
out of there quickly and safely.

45
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:57,013
l don't care who they are
or how you find them.

46
00:08:58,319 --> 00:09:00,479
l want those names by tomorrow.

47
00:09:19,732 --> 00:09:20,721
Julian...

48
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,129
With all due respect,
what you're planning is suicide.

49
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:28,660
Diving into a war when
we have one going on here, at home.

50
00:09:28,738 --> 00:09:32,605
Benito Garcia is teaming up with
the guys from the South to attack us.

51
00:09:32,908 --> 00:09:35,034
Plus, there's the DEA and FBl to consider.

52
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:38,238
lt's the worst possible time
to try something like this,

53
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,143
assuming your brother is still alive.

54
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:45,580
Juan is alive, Eladio.

55
00:09:46,216 --> 00:09:47,944
He has to be.

56
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:51,709
l must bring him back.

57
00:09:52,153 --> 00:09:54,677
l can't ignore my duty to my family,

58
00:09:56,356 --> 00:09:57,687
to my mom.

59
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:03,694
Arrange a meeting with Benito Garcia
to buy us some time.

60
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:07,856
l need you to take care of my family.

61
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,787
What else?

62
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:14,956
Tell me!

63
00:10:15,868 --> 00:10:18,802
We found a bomb under your car today.

64
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:23,367
Thankfully, we found it
before your son got in.

65
00:10:52,392 --> 00:10:56,088
-Didn't you have dinner?
-Yeah, but l got hungry again.

66
00:10:57,628 --> 00:10:58,993
How was your game?

67
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:03,022
Remember, it's not only
about swinging hard,

68
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:05,629
but guessing what the pitcher is thinking.

69
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:08,234
Did you shower?

70
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,131
Did you pray for Mommy?

71
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,628
-Yes.
-Good.

72
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:16,264
Are you taking me to school tomorrow?

73
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,500
No.

74
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,641
You're gonna stay here for a couple days.

75
00:11:20,843 --> 00:11:22,833
A tutor will come to teach you.

76
00:11:23,545 --> 00:11:26,570
-l'll be away for a few days.
-Where are you going?

77
00:11:27,214 --> 00:11:28,305
l'm taking a trip.

78
00:11:29,048 --> 00:11:31,311
But l'm bringing back a surprise for you.

79
00:11:31,383 --> 00:11:32,645
What is it?

80
00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:35,044
You won't even believe it.

81
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:40,354
Promise me you'll be safe.

82
00:11:41,223 --> 00:11:44,622
-When l'm not home...
-l'm the man of the house.

83
00:11:45,526 --> 00:11:46,720
That's it.

84
00:12:14,044 --> 00:12:15,840
Look me in the eye.

85
00:12:20,248 --> 00:12:23,181
No one knows this business as well as l do.

86
00:12:23,883 --> 00:12:26,976
l paid a lot for your loyalty.

87
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,815
You know that l take care of my people.

88
00:12:33,824 --> 00:12:36,189
l protect them from any threat.

89
00:12:38,793 --> 00:12:41,886
And you endangered my son!

90
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:43,951
Don Julian!

91
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,254
l'd never hurt your son. l...

92
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,858
l swear, l...

93
00:12:55,003 --> 00:12:57,129
There's only one thing l'll do for you.

94
00:13:00,807 --> 00:13:02,865
l'll make it quick.

95
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:27,213
l have a message from Don Artemio:

96
00:13:27,858 --> 00:13:29,621
Sincere condolences.

97
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:34,259
He wants you to know
we'll take care of the funeral.

98
00:13:36,597 --> 00:13:38,427
For you and your kids.

99
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:43,293
My husband is dead
because of that dirty money.

100
00:13:49,172 --> 00:13:50,604
Listen, lady,

101
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:53,568
if you want to see your husband so badly,

102
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:58,307
we'll gladly send you and
your boys to heaven with him.

103
00:14:20,191 --> 00:14:21,419
Julian!

104
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,189
Julian!

105
00:15:39,108 --> 00:15:41,769
Everyone knows Antonio
''The Cannibal'' Hernandez,

106
00:15:41,843 --> 00:15:43,867
one of our most loyal man.

107
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:45,707
Good choice, but no.

108
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,311
He's too hot-headed.

109
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:51,582
He can't keep his cool when needed.

110
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,344
This mission isn't for him.

111
00:15:55,652 --> 00:15:56,641
Next.

112
00:16:00,555 --> 00:16:02,785
We all remember Chema Diaz.

113
00:16:02,857 --> 00:16:04,619
He is not a youngster anymore,

114
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:08,459
but he's an experienced fighter.

115
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:12,087
He was in Vietnam and the cartel wars.

116
00:16:13,397 --> 00:16:16,627
Chema's health is in excellent condition,

117
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:18,962
and he's the best strategist we had.

118
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:24,429
He's retired and he lives
in his manor in Beverly Hills.

119
00:16:25,438 --> 00:16:27,429
Here's a snack for the road, Daddy.

120
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:33,539
Why would they bother
you this late at night?

121
00:16:34,978 --> 00:16:36,968
l'll only be gone a few days.

122
00:16:37,846 --> 00:16:40,370
l need some fresh air, don't you think?

123
00:16:46,852 --> 00:16:48,443
l can't say no.

124
00:16:50,288 --> 00:16:52,084
lt's a matter of honor.

125
00:16:52,956 --> 00:16:54,252
Something good.

126
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:58,056
You'll be proud of me.

127
00:16:59,526 --> 00:17:01,686
l don't need you to do anything.

128
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:04,324
l'm not asking you to save the world.

129
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:25,398
Not bad.

130
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:27,535
Not bad.

131
00:17:27,878 --> 00:17:30,277
-Who else?
-Rosalio Mendoza.

132
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:33,410
A top student from the Air Force Academy

133
00:17:34,082 --> 00:17:38,141
and responsible for most
of the Colombia-Cancun deliveries.

134
00:17:38,551 --> 00:17:40,485
There's no radar that can detect him.

135
00:17:40,953 --> 00:17:45,218
He's a trustworthy man,
and a very important link

136
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:47,756
between the USA and our organization.

137
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,426
Cheers!

138
00:18:33,787 --> 00:18:36,414
Where are your manners, man?

139
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:40,280
You trying to ruin my goddaughter's party?

140
00:18:40,925 --> 00:18:43,757
Tell me who sent you
or l'll kill you where you stand.

141
00:18:47,296 --> 00:18:48,421
Very good.

142
00:18:49,364 --> 00:18:50,421
Very good.

143
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:51,855
Not bad.

144
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:53,690
Next.

145
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:02,964
Our next man is held at Las Animas
Maximum Security Facility.

146
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:06,000
He's facing trial for several murders.

147
00:19:07,475 --> 00:19:09,772
Juventino ''Pumita'' Rodriguez
will be extradited...

148
00:19:10,811 --> 00:19:13,802
Eladio, l'm not in the mood for jokes!

149
00:19:14,647 --> 00:19:17,672
That guy's killed more people,
but he almost killed me too!

150
00:19:17,749 --> 00:19:19,875
l still have a bullet in my ass!

151
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,843
Plus, he's with Benito Garcia!
l only want to see that guy dead.

152
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:27,580
Actually, we sent a hit squad,
but he managed to escape.

153
00:19:28,355 --> 00:19:32,119
Julian, even if he's from the enemy cartel,

154
00:19:32,224 --> 00:19:35,715
he has all the skills
required for this mission.

155
00:19:36,127 --> 00:19:39,721
He's cold-blooded, has military training,

156
00:19:40,063 --> 00:19:43,929
he can improvise and has a deadly aim.

157
00:20:03,845 --> 00:20:06,210
l was gonna die anyway.

158
00:20:07,848 --> 00:20:11,282
But l'd rather you kill me than the gringos.

159
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,547
You're already dead, Pumita.

160
00:20:14,485 --> 00:20:16,316
You're dead to your people

161
00:20:18,354 --> 00:20:19,877
and dead to the Americans.

162
00:20:21,757 --> 00:20:24,020
You're a breathing corpse.

163
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:27,318
But Julian Perez has an offer for you.

164
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,952
An offer of life.

165
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,929
When they said you'd be heading
to the big leagues,

166
00:20:34,998 --> 00:20:36,726
they weren't exaggerating.

167
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:40,665
We need your skills in a very special place.

168
00:20:40,735 --> 00:20:42,031
You do?

169
00:20:44,004 --> 00:20:45,300
Where?

170
00:20:47,072 --> 00:20:48,266
lraq.

171
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:24,558
They say no man lasts till the end.

172
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:31,290
That the pain kills them
before the poison does.

173
00:21:34,136 --> 00:21:37,865
lf l give you this antidote
in less than 60 seconds,

174
00:21:38,906 --> 00:21:41,032
there might be hope for you.

175
00:21:42,308 --> 00:21:43,797
Look, Pumita,

176
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:46,842
this is like a game show.

177
00:21:46,944 --> 00:21:49,776
And you get to choose one of two prizes.

178
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,242
You can either visit
the wonders of the Middle East,

179
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,047
or we'll see if you can fly.

180
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,452
Fine.

181
00:22:16,129 --> 00:22:17,892
We'll see what we can do.

182
00:22:24,402 --> 00:22:25,732
Even with Pumita,

183
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,766
we need one more man.

184
00:22:30,005 --> 00:22:31,266
I know where to find him.

185
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:59,384
l see you're as feisty as ever, Carmelo.

186
00:24:12,404 --> 00:24:13,392
No.

187
00:24:14,372 --> 00:24:15,861
l've changed.

188
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,136
But you've always known
how to bring out the worst in people.

189
00:24:25,212 --> 00:24:27,202
l heard about Amelia.

190
00:24:28,047 --> 00:24:29,446
l'm sorry.

191
00:24:34,018 --> 00:24:35,110
Cancer.

192
00:24:37,387 --> 00:24:39,320
lt's been almost four years.

193
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:46,283
Carmelo,

194
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:48,683
l need your help.

195
00:24:53,463 --> 00:24:55,259
lt's not what you think.

196
00:24:56,632 --> 00:24:58,724
Nothing good comes from you.

197
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:03,031
You're still my best friend.

198
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,969
We aren't those kids anymore.

199
00:25:09,073 --> 00:25:11,132
Pain has torn us apart.

200
00:25:12,976 --> 00:25:14,533
This is my land.

201
00:25:15,077 --> 00:25:16,635
lt's best you leave.

202
00:25:22,249 --> 00:25:24,580
Juan is missing in lraq.

203
00:25:40,694 --> 00:25:44,527
Someone will have to take care
of my lot while l'm not here.

204
00:25:45,997 --> 00:25:48,897
They'll have to replant what you've ruined.

205
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,364
We'll move to the Syrian border

206
00:25:58,739 --> 00:26:01,605
and we'll enter lraq from there.

207
00:26:02,307 --> 00:26:03,672
Where the hell is lraq?

208
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:07,173
Everyone knows that, Carmelo!

209
00:26:07,477 --> 00:26:11,572
lt's right next to Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia, Spain, and Holland!

210
00:26:11,814 --> 00:26:15,249
-Plus, we're taking maps!
-With all due respect, Don Julian,

211
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:21,716
l think it's important to have
a local contact there, because

212
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,786
according to our strategy,
we have to move fast.

213
00:26:24,855 --> 00:26:27,652
Not to worry, Chema.
That's been taken care of.

214
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:31,290
Okay, fellows, as you all know,

215
00:26:31,893 --> 00:26:36,055
what you'll be paid
is much more than in four lifetimes.

216
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:38,786
lf any of you doesn't return,

217
00:26:45,302 --> 00:26:47,428
the money will go to whoever you want,

218
00:26:47,703 --> 00:26:51,331
you'll have a funeral fit for a king,
with your own soundtrack and everything.

219
00:26:53,273 --> 00:26:56,503
One more thing: The code word
for this mission,

220
00:26:57,709 --> 00:27:01,269
our call sign, our battle cry

221
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,267
will be

222
00:27:08,883 --> 00:27:10,043
''Tomato.''

223
00:28:22,898 --> 00:28:25,195
Look at that beauty.

224
00:28:30,702 --> 00:28:32,430
Chill out, Carmelo.

225
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,437
lt's easier to fall off a horse than a plane.

226
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,597
Well, l don't like horses either.

227
00:29:53,789 --> 00:29:57,656
-Freeze!
-Don't move or we'll shoot!

228
00:29:57,725 --> 00:29:59,783
What do you want here?

229
00:30:06,864 --> 00:30:10,799
-This wasn't part of the plan, was it?
-Stay calm, everyone.

230
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,863
Let me talk to them.

231
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:20,404
ldentify yourselves!
You have no idea what you have done!

232
00:30:20,473 --> 00:30:22,167
Speak up, or l'll have you all executed!

233
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:35,881
My friends are awfully absent-minded.

234
00:30:36,383 --> 00:30:40,215
-lt's their first time in Turkey.
-Who the hell are you?

235
00:30:43,754 --> 00:30:45,346
Look here,

236
00:30:45,588 --> 00:30:47,112
you idiot.

237
00:30:53,828 --> 00:30:55,317
Understood?

238
00:30:55,762 --> 00:30:59,958
Or do you want to know who l really am?

239
00:31:00,698 --> 00:31:01,926
You scum!

240
00:31:04,334 --> 00:31:05,994
Let's go!

241
00:31:10,005 --> 00:31:13,769
Welcome, my friends! Sasha Baginski.

242
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,380
Look, Carmelo!
Look, look!

243
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:34,115
To your right, Don Julian, please.

244
00:32:36,993 --> 00:32:38,221
No problem.

245
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:26,883
Here's what you asked me for.

246
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:28,456
Your weapons.

247
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,060
-Stand still!
-Go off.

248
00:33:36,698 --> 00:33:41,065
-How will we get out of here?
-We'll travel in the traditional way.

249
00:35:20,365 --> 00:35:21,353
So?

250
00:35:22,466 --> 00:35:24,456
Do you regret what you did?

251
00:35:25,168 --> 00:35:26,157
No.

252
00:35:26,502 --> 00:35:28,662
Ah, kid.

253
00:35:43,612 --> 00:35:46,546
l was also a kid when l killed my first.

254
00:35:47,549 --> 00:35:49,038
You know what they say.

255
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:53,550
''The first step is the hardest.'' But then...

256
00:36:01,024 --> 00:36:03,014
Why go to the USA?

257
00:36:03,926 --> 00:36:05,916
You'll be a nobody there.

258
00:36:06,928 --> 00:36:09,122
You already had a good start here.

259
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:13,057
We all need a family

260
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:15,223
to survive.

261
00:36:17,201 --> 00:36:19,465
Plus, your mom and brother

262
00:36:20,203 --> 00:36:22,500
will have someone to protect them.

263
00:36:22,771 --> 00:36:25,238
That's why we're men, right?

264
00:36:26,107 --> 00:36:28,074
To protect what we love.

265
00:36:33,379 --> 00:36:36,108
There's something special about you, boy.

266
00:36:37,047 --> 00:36:39,810
l would hate to kill you...

267
00:36:41,217 --> 00:36:42,513
Because here,

268
00:36:43,485 --> 00:36:45,145
you're either with us

269
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:47,945
or you're gone.

270
00:37:04,031 --> 00:37:05,019
This bullet

271
00:37:06,032 --> 00:37:07,623
was for you.

272
00:37:19,274 --> 00:37:20,571
Morning!

273
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,242
Good morning, Chacha.

274
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,278
No, it's ''Sasha.''

275
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,876
Good morning, Mexicans!

276
00:37:36,252 --> 00:37:38,446
Just a little, l'm pretty sick.

277
00:37:41,488 --> 00:37:43,853
And your friend with the long hair?

278
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,020
What's this?

279
00:37:56,932 --> 00:38:00,331
Babooshka's recipe. My grandmother.

280
00:38:05,503 --> 00:38:07,300
lt tastes a little different.

281
00:38:07,372 --> 00:38:08,736
Give me some Tabasco.

282
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:22,171
l would have appreciated a dish
like this in Afghanistan.

283
00:38:22,247 --> 00:38:23,236
Here!

284
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:32,684
Here they come.

285
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,903
Thanks, Julian.

286
00:39:06,076 --> 00:39:08,566
This is a great gift.

287
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,570
Don't mention it.

288
00:39:15,615 --> 00:39:18,276
A great partner like you deserves the best.

289
00:39:21,285 --> 00:39:23,344
l heard you entered new markets.

290
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,878
What could l do?

291
00:39:25,522 --> 00:39:29,547
lt's easier to sell weapons
than a glass of water around here.

292
00:39:30,992 --> 00:39:34,585
Thanks to my business vision
we have one chance

293
00:39:34,927 --> 00:39:36,622
to save your brother.

294
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:41,125
However, l have to tell you
that this one chance

295
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:44,428
is very slim.

296
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,742
Hey, kitty cat!

297
00:40:05,847 --> 00:40:07,576
Nice tattoo!

298
00:40:16,255 --> 00:40:18,449
There are some safe roads.

299
00:40:18,756 --> 00:40:19,744
Here

300
00:40:20,257 --> 00:40:22,247
and near the Tigris River.

301
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:26,026
Or was it on the other side? Here.

302
00:40:30,563 --> 00:40:32,258
A small group of men

303
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:34,821
in a single car

304
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:37,426
will not look suspicious.

305
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,535
-What are we waiting for?
-Calm down.

306
00:40:40,937 --> 00:40:43,837
Do you want to just get to lraq and get killed

307
00:40:44,405 --> 00:40:46,929
or get there and save your brother?

308
00:40:47,207 --> 00:40:50,767
A great rescue is done with a cool head.

309
00:40:51,477 --> 00:40:53,034
And at the moment,

310
00:40:53,711 --> 00:40:57,510
-our blood is boiling.
-l know, l know.

311
00:40:57,781 --> 00:41:00,544
But now it's my own blood that calls to me.

312
00:41:01,016 --> 00:41:04,143
You're going to need
the best backup there is.

313
00:41:04,885 --> 00:41:06,681
Sasha!

314
00:41:11,056 --> 00:41:12,147
Sasha.

315
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:19,820
He's my best man.
He'll help you and go with you.

316
00:41:25,465 --> 00:41:27,864
This is not a standard mission.

317
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,130
We may not come back.

318
00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:34,236
l'll be with you till the end, Don Julian.

319
00:41:34,938 --> 00:41:38,373
We just received a message.
lt's from your people in Mexico.

320
00:41:39,341 --> 00:41:42,002
Julian, this was recorded three days ago.

321
00:41:42,909 --> 00:41:44,570
This is good news.

322
00:41:45,145 --> 00:41:46,441
Your brother is alive.

323
00:41:47,413 --> 00:41:50,245
Bad news is, the rebels who appear here

324
00:41:50,515 --> 00:41:52,414
belong to a radical group.

325
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,449
Their policy.; No policies.

326
00:41:56,618 --> 00:42:00,246
I'll send you all the info
over the satellite phone.

327
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:11,316
Pumita...

328
00:42:13,596 --> 00:42:15,860
How does it feel to be above ground again?

329
00:42:17,131 --> 00:42:20,998
How does it feel to leave
the retirement home?

330
00:42:22,668 --> 00:42:27,001
When l look at you, l see a brat,
looking for something to steal.

331
00:42:27,905 --> 00:42:31,897
Hiding under a car so no one sees you cry.

332
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:36,101
One day you found a gun,
and suddenly, you felt like a man.

333
00:42:45,283 --> 00:42:47,273
Nobody cares about you, Pumita.

334
00:42:47,384 --> 00:42:49,783
They only dig you up to hire you

335
00:42:50,553 --> 00:42:51,952
or kill you, am l right?

336
00:42:53,254 --> 00:42:55,653
You're lucky l pity you.

337
00:42:56,256 --> 00:43:00,385
lt'd be a waste to use a bullet
on an old man like you.

338
00:43:02,728 --> 00:43:04,627
No matter how cocky you are,

339
00:43:06,529 --> 00:43:09,224
you'll always be that screwed up little punk.

340
00:43:51,392 --> 00:43:52,381
A drink

341
00:43:52,693 --> 00:43:55,388
of Mexican power and energy.

342
00:43:55,461 --> 00:43:56,791
-Hear, hear.
-Cheers.

343
00:44:13,005 --> 00:44:14,131
Comrade...

344
00:44:14,707 --> 00:44:19,802
You're a very strong, brave, and
good-looking man. You'll make it.

345
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:21,333
Good luck.

346
00:44:22,311 --> 00:44:23,369
Likewise.

347
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,064
You serious?

348
00:45:09,642 --> 00:45:10,631
What?

349
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:14,934
Just look at the color.

350
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:20,808
l won't discuss matters
of night camouflage with you.

351
00:45:21,483 --> 00:45:23,746
You do know we're arriving by day, right?

352
00:45:51,502 --> 00:45:53,094
That's a pretty song.

353
00:46:00,808 --> 00:46:02,035
Hey, Chacha.

354
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:06,239
ls this the safest road?

355
00:46:06,946 --> 00:46:08,970
Of course it is.

356
00:46:10,647 --> 00:46:12,342
lt's the safest road.

357
00:46:13,916 --> 00:46:16,475
lt's a map to avoid land mines.

358
00:46:52,541 --> 00:46:53,974
Keep trying.

359
00:46:55,243 --> 00:46:57,506
Don Eladio, a call for you.

360
00:47:08,818 --> 00:47:12,810
-Good morning, Secretary.
-I have to talk to your boss.

361
00:47:13,321 --> 00:47:17,722
Julian is busy, but rest assured,
delivery times remain as planned.

362
00:47:18,158 --> 00:47:19,886
I didn't make myself clear.

363
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:23,657
I heard you guys are up to something funny.

364
00:47:24,395 --> 00:47:26,885
We heard about certain secret meetings

365
00:47:27,697 --> 00:47:29,527
with Benito Garcia.

366
00:47:29,999 --> 00:47:32,967
Tell me, what are they offering you?

367
00:47:33,867 --> 00:47:36,528
No! Two shipments to New York

368
00:47:36,669 --> 00:47:39,228
and three to Miami,
not the other way around!

369
00:47:39,304 --> 00:47:41,238
Right. Hey, listen.

370
00:47:41,306 --> 00:47:42,567
What?

371
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,369
Get the hell out, Doc. Now!

372
00:47:46,009 --> 00:47:49,034
Nothing. Well, learn how to listen, damn it!

373
00:47:49,878 --> 00:47:50,866
Fine.

374
00:47:51,078 --> 00:47:52,477
BENlTO GARClA'S MANOR

375
00:47:52,647 --> 00:47:54,614
What's up, dear Giorgio?

376
00:47:56,615 --> 00:47:58,139
You're good at that.

377
00:47:58,449 --> 00:47:59,882
You're a wizard, man!

378
00:48:00,718 --> 00:48:03,345
But you've been painting that for 6 months.

379
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,354
Hurry up! You practically live here.

380
00:48:07,322 --> 00:48:08,687
What's up, George?

381
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,020
lt's really pretty!

382
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,384
Let's see.

383
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:22,061
When does it spin?

384
00:48:23,966 --> 00:48:25,126
Where's the water?

385
00:48:25,367 --> 00:48:26,856
The fountain doesn't work.

386
00:48:28,203 --> 00:48:30,636
What do you mean ''complicated''? Gringo!

387
00:48:32,505 --> 00:48:34,995
l want my world spinning by tomorrow!

388
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:36,334
Got it?

389
00:48:42,245 --> 00:48:43,541
l can't believe it.

390
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,315
All that begging to negotiate
a truce, and Julian sends his butler.

391
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:51,074
Don Benito.

392
00:48:59,856 --> 00:49:02,086
Don Julian sends his regards

393
00:49:02,325 --> 00:49:05,724
and regrets not being able
to attend this urgent meeting.

394
00:49:08,761 --> 00:49:12,059
l am fully authorized to make
any deal on his behalf.

395
00:49:13,031 --> 00:49:15,521
And what could possibly
be more important than this?

396
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,167
A family emergency.

397
00:49:35,945 --> 00:49:40,005
KARBALA, lRAQ

398
00:49:49,688 --> 00:49:51,416
Don't get distracted, Pumita.

399
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:54,453
l don't want to get killed
because of your nerves.

400
00:50:01,996 --> 00:50:04,691
The contact is waiting for us there.

401
00:50:23,709 --> 00:50:24,903
What?

402
00:50:25,044 --> 00:50:26,067
No idea.

403
00:51:55,735 --> 00:51:58,862
l'm your contact! l'm your contact!

404
00:51:59,571 --> 00:52:02,300
Don Julian! This man is our contact!

405
00:52:02,707 --> 00:52:08,302
We're sorry. You'll understand
that we're under some stress.

406
00:52:10,078 --> 00:52:14,604
There's a town near An Najaf.

407
00:52:14,914 --> 00:52:18,440
The Americans destroyed
everything with bombs from above.

408
00:52:18,516 --> 00:52:20,881
The Americans destroyed
everything with bombs.

409
00:52:21,285 --> 00:52:23,115
They don't suspect that this is

410
00:52:23,186 --> 00:52:28,816
where the resistance keeps
their hostages, including soldiers.

411
00:52:29,824 --> 00:52:32,951
They don't suspect that this is
where the resistance keeps

412
00:52:33,026 --> 00:52:35,994
their hostages, including soldiers.

413
00:52:36,061 --> 00:52:37,425
So they have my brother!

414
00:52:37,495 --> 00:52:43,090
-ls this soldier there?
-No, no, l've never been there

415
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:49,932
and l don't know who is there.
lf he's not dead, maybe he's there.

416
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:55,529
lf your brother is alive, chances are
that we will find him there.

417
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:58,835
l want facts, not just ''chances''!

418
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:00,466
This isn't what we agreed!

419
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:03,769
We need real, reliable information!

420
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:09,311
We're in lraq!
You won't get any better information!

421
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:12,716
l'm a professional, not like
this big-nosed moron

422
00:53:12,785 --> 00:53:15,218
who prefers to punch me for no reason.

423
00:53:16,286 --> 00:53:20,016
He says his information
is as reliable as possible,

424
00:53:20,156 --> 00:53:23,215
and he does not like you
very much, to tell the truth.

425
00:53:24,625 --> 00:53:25,887
Where's my money?

426
00:53:28,328 --> 00:53:31,490
First you insult me
and now you won't pay me!

427
00:53:34,866 --> 00:53:36,264
-We must pay him!
-Here!

428
00:53:38,401 --> 00:53:40,460
Easy... Easy!

429
00:54:23,563 --> 00:54:26,554
Our position is compromised!
We must leave!

430
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:44,967
Get him!

431
00:54:49,246 --> 00:54:50,235
Carmelo!

432
00:54:55,117 --> 00:54:57,516
-lt's safer this way! This way!
-Let's go!

433
00:55:24,936 --> 00:55:27,403
Drop your weapons!

434
00:55:27,471 --> 00:55:29,132
Drop them now!

435
00:55:29,206 --> 00:55:33,038
We aren't with the Americans!
We come in peace!

436
00:55:33,808 --> 00:55:35,638
We're on a rescue mission!

437
00:55:36,043 --> 00:55:38,738
No one is ''neutral'' here! This is a firefight!

438
00:55:38,811 --> 00:55:39,971
They saved me and my mom!

439
00:56:00,792 --> 00:56:03,954
Hey, wetback! Burritos for everyone!

440
00:56:09,164 --> 00:56:11,222
You're not a boy anymore.

441
00:56:12,967 --> 00:56:15,764
And you're not just a hired gun.

442
00:56:16,768 --> 00:56:18,429
Now you're the boss.

443
00:56:19,637 --> 00:56:20,797
Congratulations.

444
00:56:22,906 --> 00:56:24,669
l came to take you to Mexico.

445
00:56:25,407 --> 00:56:26,897
So you'll live well.

446
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:30,436
You're my family,
l want to give you the best.

447
00:56:31,945 --> 00:56:34,037
You know that can't be, Julian.

448
00:56:35,281 --> 00:56:37,248
Mom and l left Mexico

449
00:56:38,283 --> 00:56:40,477
because we don't want to be like you.

450
00:56:42,185 --> 00:56:43,914
We can't be like you.

451
00:56:44,686 --> 00:56:46,210
Nobody will hurt you.

452
00:56:47,622 --> 00:56:49,283
Everybody respects me now.

453
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:51,414
No, Julian.

454
00:56:52,192 --> 00:56:54,216
People don't respect you.

455
00:56:55,394 --> 00:56:56,690
They fear you.

456
00:56:57,262 --> 00:57:00,321
And that's never the same thing.

457
00:57:03,533 --> 00:57:05,762
Do you think the gringos respect you?

458
00:57:06,867 --> 00:57:09,699
Aren't you ashamed
to be dressed like that? Huh?

459
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:12,031
You and l are brothers,

460
00:57:12,172 --> 00:57:14,332
but we'll never be the same!

461
00:57:16,774 --> 00:57:18,400
You call this life?

462
00:57:18,942 --> 00:57:20,932
And you call that life?

463
00:57:21,377 --> 00:57:24,868
Stop it, Julian. Stop it. For Ma's sake.

464
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,439
Let us live in peace.

465
00:57:32,951 --> 00:57:33,940
Carmelo.

466
00:58:11,876 --> 00:58:13,275
You feeling better?

467
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:27,280
Every passing minute, is a minute less
for my brother's life.

468
00:58:29,354 --> 00:58:30,911
Don't worry, Don Julian.

469
00:58:32,523 --> 00:58:34,649
We'll find him, no matter what.

470
00:58:35,491 --> 00:58:38,050
l've been in many situations like this one.

471
00:58:38,293 --> 00:58:41,318
Vietcong, November 1969.

472
00:58:41,528 --> 00:58:45,395
There was not one or two,
but seven soldiers surrounding me.

473
00:58:45,664 --> 00:58:47,528
How did you survive?

474
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:53,332
They tortured me and left me for dead.

475
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,991
Tomatoes!

476
01:02:53,189 --> 01:02:57,181
-Stop, thieves!
-You damn thieves!

477
01:02:57,959 --> 01:03:01,951
-Dirty thieves!
-Let the earth swallow them up!

478
01:03:04,163 --> 01:03:06,562
Not a word of this in Mexico!

479
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:11,689
Cover your face, you'll give us up.

480
01:03:13,369 --> 01:03:16,201
How long 'til we cross the city, Chacha?

481
01:03:16,471 --> 01:03:18,665
Depends on the Americans.

482
01:03:28,378 --> 01:03:31,006
We have a little problem.

483
01:04:08,638 --> 01:04:09,627
This way!

484
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:26,215
DANGER
FLAMMABLE

485
01:05:49,736 --> 01:05:51,032
What was that?

486
01:05:52,104 --> 01:05:53,764
We're in a tunnel,

487
01:05:54,372 --> 01:05:56,305
the acoustics play jokes.

488
01:05:57,241 --> 01:05:59,105
l don't like these jokes.

489
01:06:31,496 --> 01:06:32,757
You okay, Julian?

490
01:06:38,834 --> 01:06:40,994
Run!

491
01:09:07,496 --> 01:09:09,292
A beer,

492
01:09:09,597 --> 01:09:11,393
really cold,

493
01:09:11,865 --> 01:09:14,332
in an ice bucket.

494
01:09:19,436 --> 01:09:21,835
Hit the dirt, Tomatoes!

495
01:09:34,013 --> 01:09:36,378
-Let's follow it!
-Hide yourselves!

496
01:09:41,118 --> 01:09:42,175
Don't move!

497
01:10:13,004 --> 01:10:14,198
Follow him!

498
01:10:46,426 --> 01:10:47,950
Freeze motherf...

499
01:11:00,535 --> 01:11:02,729
There's something fishy going on here.

500
01:11:02,869 --> 01:11:05,860
-What are they saying, Chacha?
-Nothing useful.

501
01:11:06,172 --> 01:11:08,537
But as Chema says,
there's something weird.

502
01:11:08,707 --> 01:11:11,971
What are two old guys doing
in the middle of the desert, alone?

503
01:11:12,176 --> 01:11:14,473
Yeah, two really nice old guys.

504
01:11:15,278 --> 01:11:17,609
Keep working on the satellite phone.

505
01:11:41,527 --> 01:11:43,722
Don Julian! lt's working!

506
01:11:45,097 --> 01:11:47,326
-Let's see.
-The battery won't last long.

507
01:11:47,965 --> 01:11:49,431
Tomato One here!

508
01:11:49,599 --> 01:11:51,464
Are you okay, Julian?

509
01:11:54,403 --> 01:11:56,563
I've got information for you.

510
01:11:56,871 --> 01:11:59,805
I've got new information for you
about your brother.

511
01:11:59,873 --> 01:12:04,205
Julian, there's no time to lose, do you copy?

512
01:12:04,542 --> 01:12:07,271
You only have a few hours, do you copy?

513
01:12:07,444 --> 01:12:11,345
Copy, Eladio. l copy.
We made contact with some rebels.

514
01:12:11,547 --> 01:12:14,310
They said they're gonna kill
my brother at sunset! Over!

515
01:12:14,448 --> 01:12:17,575
...you can find Juan in Karbala.

516
01:12:17,884 --> 01:12:20,750
-What?
-They'll kill them at sunset...

517
01:12:21,553 --> 01:12:23,611
Do you copy? Julian?

518
01:12:31,426 --> 01:12:33,189
At least we know something new.

519
01:12:33,394 --> 01:12:36,089
Yeah, but now we have
to find out how to get there!

520
01:12:42,933 --> 01:12:46,868
My grandpa used to say it's important
to know where you're going.

521
01:12:48,137 --> 01:12:49,661
Once you know that

522
01:12:50,772 --> 01:12:52,763
everything falls into place.

523
01:12:56,942 --> 01:12:58,807
Your grandpa was right.

524
01:13:10,985 --> 01:13:13,509
I've got information. Do you copy?

525
01:13:31,598 --> 01:13:33,827
What's this? Who took the weapons?

526
01:13:34,033 --> 01:13:36,330
Speak up! What happened?

527
01:13:46,607 --> 01:13:49,074
Honestly, l never would have imagined that

528
01:13:49,643 --> 01:13:52,839
hot peppers would work better
than electric shocks for interrogating.

529
01:14:18,595 --> 01:14:21,757
KARBALA, lRAQ

530
01:14:51,082 --> 01:14:52,276
Who are you?

531
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:53,611
Chicken, chicken.

532
01:14:53,684 --> 01:14:54,810
Show yourself!

533
01:14:55,085 --> 01:14:56,278
Chicken, chicken.

534
01:14:58,787 --> 01:14:59,879
Tomatoes!

535
01:15:06,559 --> 01:15:07,820
Speak now!

536
01:15:08,126 --> 01:15:09,990
-Speak now!
-Don't you dare!

537
01:15:14,664 --> 01:15:15,652
Come on!

538
01:15:15,731 --> 01:15:18,665
Where are the prisoners?

539
01:15:20,101 --> 01:15:23,762
You only have one chance! Where are they?

540
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:25,667
They're in the basement!

541
01:15:25,738 --> 01:15:27,170
They're in the basement!

542
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:31,409
There's only one thing you can do,

543
01:17:33,586 --> 01:17:35,052
Julian Perez.

544
01:17:37,256 --> 01:17:39,450
Bring my Juan back.

545
01:17:42,359 --> 01:17:43,586
Alive.

546
01:17:45,061 --> 01:17:46,322
Alive.

547
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:48,887
Alive.

548
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:29,222
Julian?

549
01:21:07,757 --> 01:21:10,088
Do you copy? Yuri!

550
01:21:11,526 --> 01:21:12,890
What about them?

551
01:21:13,561 --> 01:21:15,619
We can't leave them here.

552
01:21:15,695 --> 01:21:16,684
Watch out!

553
01:21:20,832 --> 01:21:21,821
Don Julian!

554
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:25,234
l finally reached Yuri!

555
01:21:25,569 --> 01:21:27,229
We must leave at once!

556
01:22:29,809 --> 01:22:31,868
Yuri will meet us there!

557
01:23:32,383 --> 01:23:33,940
Julian!

558
01:23:43,423 --> 01:23:47,483
-Why doesn't the Russian shoot?
-lt's all fake... Chinese gifts!

559
01:23:59,867 --> 01:24:02,232
We have to go back for Julian and Juan!

560
01:24:02,535 --> 01:24:06,129
We only have one chance!
lf we don't make it, we'll all die!

561
01:24:06,205 --> 01:24:07,694
l don't want to die!

562
01:24:32,387 --> 01:24:33,376
Go, go, go!

563
01:28:04,657 --> 01:28:07,591
We made it! l knew it!

564
01:28:27,638 --> 01:28:29,400
When we arrive at my house,

565
01:28:31,774 --> 01:28:33,469
we'll have a barbecue.

566
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:35,401
A good one!

567
01:28:35,744 --> 01:28:38,644
My daughter is a really good cook.

568
01:28:43,048 --> 01:28:44,948
We did it.

569
01:30:12,472 --> 01:30:16,134
of the year or the decade.
Today, confidential sources

570
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:18,402
confirmed the presence of an armed unit

571
01:30:18,476 --> 01:30:21,501
made up of Mexican gunmen that infiltrated

572
01:30:21,611 --> 01:30:25,773
the military front of Karbala,
a highly dangerous war zone in Iraq,

573
01:30:25,847 --> 01:30:29,543
to rescue a Mexican soldier
originally presumed dead.

574
01:30:29,817 --> 01:30:32,979
During this rescue mission,
this elite unit of ''Mexicans'' freed

575
01:30:33,052 --> 01:30:37,578
dozens of prisoners of war
and shifted popular opinion

576
01:30:37,655 --> 01:30:40,885
as to who truly possesses
the most powerful army in the world.

577
01:30:40,990 --> 01:30:43,583
The Mexican President,
who is now in the Netherlands

578
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:46,786
has not made any comments.

579
01:30:46,861 --> 01:30:50,761
This event happened
at a bad moment during his term

580
01:30:51,263 --> 01:30:54,823
because one of his Cabinet
members was arrested today

581
01:30:54,899 --> 01:30:58,061
for criminal links with the Garcia cartel.

582
01:30:58,235 --> 01:31:02,431
Garcia brothers were arrested while
preparing an ambush on a rival gang.

583
01:31:02,571 --> 01:31:06,438
Evidence shows that this unit
operated completely autonomously

584
01:31:06,507 --> 01:31:10,532
without any clear ties to any
of the international participants

585
01:31:10,609 --> 01:31:12,702
of the military struggle.

586
01:31:12,811 --> 01:31:16,142
But there is no doubt, they are Mexicans.

587
01:31:16,413 --> 01:31:19,677
TURKEY, lSTANBUL

588
01:31:33,157 --> 01:31:34,317
To Juan Perez,

589
01:31:35,291 --> 01:31:38,157
who will be home very soon.

590
01:31:42,563 --> 01:31:43,893
To Julian.

591
01:31:45,065 --> 01:31:46,429
To Chema.

592
01:32:04,911 --> 01:32:06,605
For a new life.

593
01:32:07,813 --> 01:32:09,609
Thanks a lot.

594
01:32:14,117 --> 01:32:15,583
Good luck, gorgeous.

595
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:31,827
Are you sure about this?

596
01:32:33,396 --> 01:32:35,989
l think this is a good place to start over.

597
01:32:41,301 --> 01:32:42,324
Take care.

598
01:33:08,184 --> 01:33:10,674
I'll tell you a story

599
01:33:11,453 --> 01:33:16,218
about a man who traveled
from the other side of the sea.

600
01:33:17,391 --> 01:33:20,621
He traveled along with five brave men

601
01:33:21,159 --> 01:33:25,026
to rescue his brother

602
01:33:25,696 --> 01:33:29,392
from a hellish war.

603
01:33:30,165 --> 01:33:32,655
There is no greater power

604
01:33:35,001 --> 01:33:37,265
than the one felt

605
01:33:37,803 --> 01:33:40,067
by family blood.

606
01:36:53,862 --> 01:36:56,762
Julian Perez died three
months later in an ambush.

607
01:36:56,831 --> 01:37:00,766
His mother and brother are
living now somewhere in Mexico.
