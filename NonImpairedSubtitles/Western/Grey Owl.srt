1
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,500
Come in.

2
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,400
Excuse me, sir.
You won't know me.

3
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,700
Cyrus Finney,
<i>North Bay Nugget.</i>

4
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,100
Um, that's a newspaper.

5
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,600
<i>Three minutes, Mr. Grey Owl.</i>

6
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,700
This won't take a moment.

7
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,100
I'm trying to trace a fellow
by the name of Archie Belaney.

8
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,900
Mm-hmm.

9
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,900
Do you know him?

10
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,600
Yes, I know him.

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,800
-What took you so long?
-I had to be sure.

12
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,400
What do you want to know?

13
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,900
Whatever you want
to tell me.

14
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,900
Not much to tell.

15
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,900
He was just a kid with a dream
of livin' in the wilderness.

16
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,800
<i>And no one suspected,</i>

17
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,100
<i>even when you were working</i>
<i>as a guide?</i>

18
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,900
-<i>See anything?</i>
-Sh-sh-sh-sh.

19
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Aw, geez...

20
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,300
Did I get him?

21
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,800
I got him. Didn't I, Archie?

22
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,600
Well, Mr. Champlin,

23
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
he sure is dead.

24
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,900
You're real good
at what you do, Archie.

25
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,800
You know what?
So am I.

26
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm sure you are,
Mr. Champlin.

27
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,200
I own a paper mill
and a printing business...

28
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,300
and a couple
of book-publishing firms.

29
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,400
I am a rich man, Archie.

30
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,000
-<i>Wouldn't you like to be rich?</i>
-Why would I want to be rich?

31
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,100
<i>What you do is,</i>
<i>you write a book:</i>

32
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,200
<i>An Indian's Life</i>
<i>in the Forest.</i>

33
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,000
Same as your magazine pieces, only
longer. That would make you famous.

34
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,500
Hmm.

35
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,800
Being famous doesn't
interest me, Mr. Champlin.

36
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,100
<i>You know how hungry</i>
<i>people are out there...</i>

37
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,000
for your world?

38
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,000
The authentic voice
from the wilderness.

39
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,000
-<i>Congratulations, Harry.</i> Tres bien.
-<i>I haven't seen you in a while.</i>

40
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,500
Couldn't make it last year...
too busy.

41
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Here's to <i>my</i> first bear.

42
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,200
-<i>You want bear, you want Archie.</i>
-Salud, mon ami.

43
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,500
Here's a little something
to remember me by.

44
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,800
Here you are.
Archie Grey Owl.

45
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,700
Your <i>guide</i> wrote this?

46
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,000
"The still hunt is an art
perfected by the Indian,

47
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,300
"who has learned from childhood
to move like a shadow,

48
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,800
"his actions smooth as oil,
his senses set to a hair trigger;

49
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,400
<i>for the forest is argus-eyed."</i>

50
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,100
This is an Indian,
writing in a magazine?

51
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,200
You want to know something?

52
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,700
I'm not here just to hunt bear.

53
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,300
This fellow could be
a gold mine.

54
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,800
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Something for the dancers?

55
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,000
Thank you very much, sir. Good evening.
Something for the dancers?

56
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,400
-Thank you, sir.
-Oh, I never pay till I see the goods.

57
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,200
How do I know if this war dance
of yours is authentic?

58
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,100
The more you pay,
the more authentic it gets.

59
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,300
-Terrific! Well done, boys.
-<i>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

60
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,300
We call that
"The Dance of the Dead Men."

61
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,200
When the dance is done
and the drums fall silent,

62
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,300
we hurl ourselves
upon the hated white man...

63
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,800
<i>and we kill.</i>

64
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,100
But that costs extra.

65
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,200
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
mesdames et messieurs,

66
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,000
I hope you've enjoyed
our little show.

67
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,100
<i>May I welcome you to dinner?</i>

68
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,200
<i>I read what you wrote</i>
<i>in that magazine.</i>

69
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,900
<i>You can write.</i>
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

70
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,000
You can read.
I'm impressed.

71
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,600
You booked today?

72
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,800
<i>You want to go huntin'?</i>

73
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,100
No. I want to learn
about my people.

74
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,000
-Who's your people?
-Mohawk... Iroquois Confederacy.

75
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,000
First Mohawk I seen
dressed like that.

76
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,200
Then you've never been in
downtown Val d'Or on a Saturday night.

77
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,700
Two bucks for the day.

78
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,600
Maybe something at the end
to show your appreciation.

79
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,500
<i>Oh, I can't pay you.</i>

80
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,200
So why should I take you?

81
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,100
-Men always do what I want.
-<i>Sure.</i>

82
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,600
Men jump in the lake
for just one of your smiles, right?

83
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,400
Right.

84
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,400
<i>Be back in an hour.</i>

85
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,900
Jump in the lake and
I'll give you 50 cents... right now!

86
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,900
You got it, Pony!

87
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Hmm.

88
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,200
-The world of your ancestors.
-My ancestors wouldn't have done that.

89
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,600
But that's not
where we're going, is it?

90
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,100
No. Up ahead.

91
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,800
Bear Island... Ojibwa village.
See how our people live.

92
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,500
-<i>Your village?</i>
-<i>Could say that.</i>

93
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,900
<i>Chief kind of adopted me</i>
<i>a long time ago.</i>

94
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
<i>Can I meet him?</i>

95
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,600
He'll think you're my woman,
and I brought you for him to inspect.

96
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,700
Then we can inspect each other.

97
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,200
He's up here.
I'll lead the way.

98
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,300
This what you wanted?

99
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,400
It's not what I expected.

100
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,800
It's a hard life they have here.

101
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,400
Shh. Hey.

102
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,400
<i>Hey!</i>

103
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,400
You young devil!
Where've you been for so long?

104
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,400
Oh, earning a living.
Good to see you.

105
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,200
Oh, Ned.

106
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,400
My young brother.

107
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,200
Hello, Ned.
Some dancing.

108
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,200
-Who is this you bring to see me?
-Mmm...

109
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,600
My name is Gertrude Bernard.

110
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Chief Pete Misabi.

111
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,900
-I'm honored, Father.
-<i>Lovely. Very lovely.</i>

112
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,700
She's your wife?

113
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,800
No, no, no.
Just a friend.

114
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,000
<i>When the time is right,</i>
<i>you tell him...</i>

115
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,800
he bring you to me,
and I make the wedding.

116
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,200
Uh, Pete,
no one's marrying anybody.

117
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,300
-He's kinda old, you think?
-Well, he does look kind of old.

118
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,000
Well, with the life he leads,
what do you expect?

119
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,400
He's a great hunter, great trapper.
He'll provide well for you.

120
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,600
You think he's the kind of man
a girl can rely on?

121
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,000
That I cannot say.
He's a wanderer, you know.

122
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That's why I gave him his name:
Wa-Sha-Quon-Asin... Grey Owl...

123
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,600
he who walks by night.

124
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,600
-Can you manage?
-Yeah, sure.

125
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,300
Are you really called
Gertrude?

126
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,800
You think I'd make up
a name like that?

127
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,500
So what do they call you?
Gertie?

128
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,600
Do I look like a Gertie?

129
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,600
I wouldn't know.

130
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,400
I'm called Pony,
my father's pet name for me.

131
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,700
-<i>Don't ask me why.</i>
-Hmm. I won't.

132
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,500
How about a good-bye kiss,
to show my appreciation?

133
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,600
<i>Sure.</i>

134
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,300
-That was it?
-Takes two to kiss.

135
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,300
Hmm?

136
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,100
See you around,
Archie Grey Owl.

137
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,100
Ned, come on.
Get a move on.

138
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,000
There's a wind comin' up.
I want to get back before dark.

139
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,900
<i>I can only stay here</i>
<i>five minutes.</i>

140
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,800
<i>Hey, you!</i>
<i>Don't I know you?</i>

141
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,700
-Do me a favor. Where am I?
-You're in Elk River.

142
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,000
What the hell am I doin'
in Elk River?

143
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,500
-It's as far as the railroad goes.
-<i>Oh, end of the line, eh?</i>

144
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,100
-Yup, end of the line.
-<i>Hurry it up, you guys!</i>

145
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,700
-<i>Friend of yours?</i>
-Never seen him before in my life.

146
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,100
Are you the fella
they call Archie Grey Owl?

147
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,400
That's me.

148
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,400
I'm Jim Bernard,
Pony's father.

149
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
What can I do for you?

150
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,600
Well, sir,

151
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,000
Pony's been offered a job
in Montreal.

152
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,100
<i>She's supposed to start</i>
<i>next week.</i>

153
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,600
-Sounds good.
-<i>But she says she's not going.</i>

154
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,600
Got this Indian bug.

155
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,400
-Wants to live like her ancestors.
-<i>Hmm.</i>

156
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,800
It's all moonshine.

157
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,400
Can't turn back the clock.
That life's over.

158
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,900
-Nobody lives in the forest anymore.
-I do.

159
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,400
How the hell
do you survive up there?

160
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,300
Oh, I don't need that much.

161
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,900
The forest looks after me.

162
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,200
Brave talk.

163
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,900
-Got my daughter all fired up.
-She wouldn't last a week.

164
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,600
Then why is she planning
on goin' up north with you?

165
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,000
Oh, I never said that.

166
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,400
What Pony wants, Pony gets.

167
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,600
Of course, you could always strike camp
and go before she knew it.

168
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,100
Then you'd be gone.

169
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Yeah.

170
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,100
Yeah.

171
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,800
Archie!

172
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,700
She told me you said I could bring her.

173
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,200
Are you out of your bloody mind?
What am I gonna do with her out here?

174
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,100
-Hell, I thought you'd want her here.
-Don't think!

175
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,500
Just take her back with you
in the morning. Get her outta here.

176
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,600
-Sure, Archie, if that's what you want.
-That's what I want.

177
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,700
-You're goin' back with Ned.
-No.

178
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,800
<i>I didn't invite you here. I don't</i>
<i>want you here. I'm telling you to go.</i>

179
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,000
-<i>I'm telling you I won't.</i>
-I don't have time to nursemaid you.

180
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,700
-Fine. Don't.
-<i>Then you'll die.</i>

181
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,200
-So I die.
-I mean it!

182
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,600
You don't know
what life's like here.

183
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,000
It's hard, and it's dangerous.
Tell her, Ned.

184
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,900
Sure is hard and dangerous.

185
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,700
-This is no life for a woman.
-<i>I'm not going.</i>

186
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,600
So either you tie me up
and have Ned carry me back,

187
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,900
or I stay right here.

188
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
<i>What are you doing?</i>

189
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,100
Making a torch.

190
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,600
What for?

191
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,300
Huntin'.

192
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,900
-Can I come?
-No.

193
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,100
<i>If you don't like it,</i>
<i>you don't have to watch.</i>

194
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,200
I'm okay.

195
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,400
My people were hunters once.

196
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,300
-Do you have a Mohawk name?
-<i>Yes.</i>

197
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,300
I'm named after
my great-grandmother, Anahareo.

198
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,300
How come you're called Archie?

199
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,200
I'm a half-breed.

200
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,200
How else do you think I got these
blue eyes? My mother was Scottish.

201
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,600
I didn't know that.

202
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,500
You have a problem with that?

203
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,500
-<i>No. No problem.</i>
-That's all right then.

204
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,900
-You want some?
-Huh?

205
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,700
Yeah, okay.

206
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,300
You ever been married, Archie?

207
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,400
<i>Twice.</i>

208
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,300
-What happened?
-<i>Oh, nothing.</i>

209
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,300
We spent some time together...

210
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,400
and moved on.

211
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,900
<i>Why get married if you know</i>
<i>you're going to leave?</i>

212
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,500
Why get married if you know
you're gonna stay?

213
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,900
That's the old way...

214
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
marry when the time comes
to part,

215
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,600
like a warrior going to war,

216
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,900
a hunter leaving
on a long journey.

217
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Just put it down there.
Thank you.

218
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,500
That way you keep
a piece of each other forever.

219
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,600
I love it when you tell me
about the old ways.

220
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,900
<i>How do you know</i>
<i>I'm not just making it up?</i>

221
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,300
I know when you're faking it.

222
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,300
Oh?

223
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,600
Like when?

224
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,000
When you grunt at me like you
don't want me around,

225
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,700
and I know you do.

226
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,600
This used to be a beaver dam.

227
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,600
Some stinking white men,
call themselves trappers,

228
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,800
been using dynamite
in my territory.

229
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,500
No Indians would do this.

230
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,700
We don't take the kittens.

231
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,000
We don't destroy the lodges.

232
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,400
Soon there'll be no beaver left.

233
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,300
-How much further?
-A good way yet.

234
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,300
I'm getting cold.

235
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,400
We'll go across the lake.
It'll get us back before dark.

236
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,800
<i>Snow's coming.</i>
<i>Spread your weight, slide.</i>

237
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,400
-Don't get too near now, okay?
-<i>Okay.</i>

238
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,800
Whatever you do, don't stop.
May be some soft spots.

239
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,200
<i>You're going too fast.</i>

240
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,400
I can't keep up.

241
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,400
Will you wait?

242
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,900
Archie!

243
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,900
<i>I can't go on!</i>
<i>I have to rest!</i>

244
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,300
Archie!

245
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,600
-Don't move!
-Archie!

246
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,900
Don't move!
You'll make the hole bigger!

247
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,100
Don't move! Don't move!

248
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,100
Help me!

249
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:04,400
-Don't move. Stay still.
-Help me.

250
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,300
Look at me.
Look at me, Pony.

251
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,800
<i>Don't struggle.</i>
<i>Don't struggle!</i>

252
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,100
Stay right here.
Stay with me, Pony.

253
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,700
Grab this belt. Grab this belt.

254
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,200
<i>Pony, hold on.</i>
<i>Don't move.</i>

255
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,600
Grab it! Come on.

256
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,500
-Pony. Pony.
-I can't.

257
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,800
<i>I can't feel my legs.</i>

258
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,500
<i>I can't feel my legs.</i>

259
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,400
Come on. That's it. You're free.

260
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,300
Come on. You're gonna be...

261
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,200
-Help me! Come on!
-Come on.

262
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,400
Shh. Shh.

263
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,500
Hold this. Come on.

264
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,800
<i>Come on! Stay with me!</i>

265
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,700
-<i>I can't. I can't get up!</i>
-Get up. Get up, Pony!

266
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,100
-Get up! Get up.
-I can't!

267
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,600
Pony, get up.
Come on, Pony, please.

268
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,000
Come on.

269
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,900
Walk!

270
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,100
Don't stop or you're gonna lock up!
Come on, run!

271
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,300
Run! Get up!

272
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,700
Get up! Get up!

273
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,200
Get up! Get up!

274
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,800
Get up.
Run. Run. Run!

275
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,100
Pony, keep moving.
Keep moving, Pony.

276
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,800
-Get up! Get up! Get up, Pony!
-I can't!

277
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,900
You're gonna freeze. Keep moving.

278
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,700
I'm so sorry.
Pony, don't die on me.

279
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,600
Don't...

280
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,200
Pony.

281
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,100
Pony, I'm such a fool.

282
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,100
There we go, Pony.

283
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,000
There we go.

284
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,100
Stay warm.

285
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,100
Stay warm.

286
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,800
<i>Nenemoosha.</i>
<i>Nenemoosha.</i>

287
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,500
-Archie?
-Right here.

288
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,700
I guess I'm not
as tough as I thought.

289
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,700
You did fine.

290
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,700
You're still alive.

291
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,900
You were stroking me.

292
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Trying to get you warm.

293
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,300
I liked that.

294
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,300
I like that too.

295
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,600
I swore I wouldn't.

296
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,400
Why not?

297
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,100
I don't know.

298
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,900
You're afraid
I'll fall in love with you.

299
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:05,100
Don't worry.
I can look after myself.

300
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,000
I guess I've always been alone.

301
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,100
But it's okay,
me being here now.

302
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,400
-Isn't it?
-Yes.

303
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,900
Better than okay.

304
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
If we can make
each other happy, Archie,

305
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,500
let's do it.

306
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,700
It's not as if
it's so easy to find.

307
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,300
Yeah.

308
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
What was that word
you called me?

309
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,800
Some Indian word.

310
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,800
<i>Nenemoosha.</i>

311
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,500
What's that?

312
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,000
It's just a word.

313
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,400
I like it.

314
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,300
What's that?

315
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
What?

316
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,400
That.

317
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,000
<i>It's called a dream-catcher.</i>

318
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,800
<i>What's it for?</i>

319
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,100
<i>You hang 'em up for babies,</i>

320
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
<i>newly-married couples.</i>

321
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,900
<i>Bad dreams get caught</i>
<i>in the web,</i>

322
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,900
<i>good dreams go through.</i>

323
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,100
-Do Mohawks have dream-catchers?
-<i>Sure.</i>

324
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,900
And all I have is a Mohawk name.

325
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,600
I need more.

326
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,500
Best of all, beaver.

327
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,100
<i>So few left,</i>
<i>they fetch good money.</i>

328
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,400
But the season's over.
You said.

329
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,400
What's here won't even
pay off my loan.

330
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,800
We have to live too, you know?

331
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,400
There's no guarantee
anyone will buy my book.

332
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,100
Why won't you let me
read what you're writing?

333
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
It's not done yet.

334
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,400
Am I in it?

335
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,400
Why would you be in it?

336
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,500
If I was writing a book,
you'd be in it.

337
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,700
Yes.

338
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,900
You're in it.

339
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,700
<i>Laid a trap here this morning.</i>

340
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,200
Bit of luck,
got us another beaver pelt.

341
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,300
The one up in the dam there.

342
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,900
That's it. This side.

343
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,700
See what we've got here.

344
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,700
-Ah, bitch!
-What is it?

345
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,800
-Trap and chain broke free.
-The beaver got away?

346
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,500
No, it'll be down there
with the trap.

347
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,300
Ten bucks shot to hell.
Aw, damn!

348
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,700
Come on. Come on.

349
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,500
Ahmik.
<i>Beaver kittens.</i>

350
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,200
<i>Where is their mother?</i>

351
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,500
She's down there in your trap,
isn't she?

352
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
She's drowned, isn't she?

353
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Most likely.

354
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,500
-<i>How are they going to live without her?</i>
-They're not.

355
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,300
They aren't weaned.
They'll slowly starve to death.

356
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,400
<i>Archie, no.</i>

357
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,500
Don't look.

358
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,200
Never... Never do that again!

359
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,200
You'll get yourself shot.

360
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,100
Shh.

361
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,100
Don't worry.

362
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,900
Nobody's going to hurt you.

363
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,000
Come on. Come on.

364
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,400
Come on, baby.

365
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,400
Come on.

366
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,200
They don't want it.

367
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,700
Why would they?

368
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,900
You're not their mother.

369
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,600
Can't you even look at them?

370
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,700
What for?

371
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,800
I'm a trapper.

372
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,400
Remember?

373
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,000
I'm not trying
to get at you, Archie.

374
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,700
You said it yourself...
soon there'll be no beaver left.

375
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,400
We can't just leave them to die.

376
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,000
Everything dies.

377
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:57,400
Flies get eaten by fish, fish get eaten
by otters, otters get eaten by wolves.

378
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,900
<i>I've seen a bear kill a wolf</i>...
<i>rip out its guts to eat.</i>

379
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,400
I've seen men kill bears,

380
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,700
and I've seen a man
three weeks dead covered in flies.

381
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,300
Kill a deer for meat...
I understand that.

382
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,700
Kill beaver to make yourself a coat
so you don't freeze to death...

383
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,800
I understand that.

384
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,300
<i>But killing as a trade,</i>
<i>to make money?</i>

385
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,300
You're better than that, Archie.

386
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,700
Forest Indians have
always been trappers.

387
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,600
-<i>Did they always trap animals for trade?</i>
-Sure.

388
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,000
<i>Archie, that's not true,</i>
<i>and you know it.</i>

389
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:42,000
The old Indian way was
you killed only what you needed.

390
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,000
It was the white traders
who taught us to kill for money.

391
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:49,400
We never even had money
before the white man came.

392
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,600
You're a woman.
You're town-raised.

393
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,600
You wouldn't understand.

394
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,300
Whatever you say, Archie.

395
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,800
Go back to sleep.

396
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,800
I don't believe this.

397
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,200
He likes you, Archie.

398
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,100
Well, I don't like him.

399
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:54,700
-Then put him back on the floor.
-Mmm.

400
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,900
I don't think he knows
you don't like him.

401
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,800
You better make it clearer.

402
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,700
Get lost, fuzzy face.

403
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,700
That's telling him.

404
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,200
Archie. Archie!

405
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,800
-<i>Yeah?</i>
-I can't find one of the micks.

406
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,700
-<i>He'll be around somewhere.</i>
-It isn't.

407
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,100
I've got one,
but where is the other?

408
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,800
Mick, mick.

409
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,300
Mick, mick.
Mick!

410
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,700
Come on.

411
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,800
Mick. Mick.

412
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,100
-Mick, mick. Mick.
-<i>Pony.</i>

413
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:57,200
-How far could it have got?
-Oh, quite a way.

414
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,800
-Can't you track it or something?
-<i>In snow, maybe.</i>

415
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,400
Now it could be anywhere.

416
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,900
Might it get as far
as the trapline?

417
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,800
No. No way.

418
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,000
Oh, God.

419
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,800
No!

420
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,200
No.

421
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,800
I'm sorry.
Oh, dear Jesus, I'm so sorry.

422
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,300
Archie, I found him.
He came back.

423
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,600
-<i>They're playing in the cabin.</i>
-You found him?

424
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,000
What happened?

425
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,600
You thought it was...

426
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,000
Oh, yes.

427
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,200
Oh, Archie.

428
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,500
I've quit.

429
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,900
I know.

430
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,800
No more trapping.

431
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,900
I love you, Archie.

432
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,500
You all set?
Sure you got everything?

433
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,500
I'm sure.

434
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,000
All right.

435
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,500
You said they hang them up for babies
and newly-married couples?

436
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,300
That's right.

437
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:30,800
What happens when you aren't
a baby anymore or a new-married?

438
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,900
I guess you handle
your own dreams.

439
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,300
Hear you got a girl.

440
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,700
News travels.

441
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:44,600
-<i>Good winter?</i>
-<i>You tell me, Gus.</i>

442
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,900
So where'd you find these?
Out Abitibi way?

443
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,100
Hey, squaw man,
I'm talkin' to ya.

444
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,100
-You have a problem?
-<i>Yeah, I have a problem.</i>

445
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,100
Some thievin' redskin's been
trappin' our territory.

446
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:09,000
-<i>Now, where'd you find these pelts?</i>
-Seventy-two.

447
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Hey, squaw man,
don't turn your back on me.

448
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:20,000
Hey, boy, step out.

449
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,600
<i>You've been raiding</i>
<i>our traplines?</i>

450
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,300
No Indian does that to m...

451
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,100
You boys better leave.

452
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,800
Be seein' <i>you</i> around.

453
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,200
Ignorant savage
shake in shoes.

454
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,800
So, uh, Archie,

455
00:49:54,900 --> 00:50:00,200
by my tally,
you tally up 290.

456
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,900
<i>You owe me another 20.</i>

457
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,000
Do me a favor, Gus.

458
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,400
Make it $20 and the postage
for my book, okay?

459
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,400
<i>Sure.</i>

460
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,000
They're the bastards
that've been poaching my traplines,

461
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,800
wipin' out the beaver.

462
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:24,200
Poison, dynamite...
it's all the same to them.

463
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,000
You take care of yourself
up there, okay?

464
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:34,200
-That's it. Step right up, please.
-<i>Pony.</i>

465
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,400
Pony.

466
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,400
<i>Thank you very much.</i>
<i>You'll have to hurry now.</i>

467
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:43,700
-You didn't get enough for the pelts?
-<i>Couldn't even clear the debt.</i>

468
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,400
A whole winter's work.

469
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,100
-Still 20 bucks down. Sorry.
-There's a pile in there to the right.

470
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,300
<i>Stack it right inside there.</i>

471
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,700
-I don't know what we do now.
-<i>There ya go.</i>

472
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:02,600
Come along now.
Step up, please.

473
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,100
<i>You like to move up now.</i>

474
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,000
I do.

475
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,600
-Feathers?
-Why not?

476
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,500
Most Indians are like my dad...
ashamed of what they are.

477
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:19,000
Put a feather in their hair, you're
saying, "I'm Indian and proud of it."

478
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:22,200
<i>I know that what brings</i>
<i>you good people to Wabikon Lodge...</i>

479
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,700
<i>is not only the fine cuisine.</i>

480
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,100
<i>Or the friendly service.</i>

481
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,900
The man who's going
to speak to you...

482
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:34,900
is an Ojibwa Indian who's lived
all his life in these forests.

483
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,000
I can't do this.

484
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,200
-He's paying cash. Think of the money.
-<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

485
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,700
Mesdames et messieurs.

486
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,600
<i>He's also the guide</i>
<i>who wrote those terrific articles...</i>

487
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,800
<i>in</i> Forest <i>and</i> Outdoors.

488
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,600
<i>Pretty good, aren't they?</i>

489
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,400
Just talk the way you write.

490
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:56,100
<i>So, ladies and gentlemen,</i> mesdames
et messieurs, <i>I give you Grey Owl.</i>

491
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,600
Thank you.

492
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,900
I've not done too much
speakin' in public before.

493
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,600
To tell the truth, I feel like
the snake that swallowed the icicle.

494
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:29,200
<i>Oh, look!</i>

495
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,600
Hello, you two.
You come to help me out?

496
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,100
These little fellas
live with us.

497
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,400
We call them the micks.

498
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,400
The Ojibwa name for beaver is <i>ahmik,</i>
"little talking brother."

499
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,000
And they do talk too.

500
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,300
Can you say "hi" to everyone?

501
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,400
Beavers are family-minded,
you know.

502
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:06,800
A beaver pair will stay together
for life, just like us... some of us.

503
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,400
<i>We're not planning on</i>
<i>holding on to these kittens too long.</i>

504
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,500
<i>As soon as they've grown,</i>
<i>we'll let them go back into the wild,</i>

505
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,500
have some babies of their own.

506
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,800
The fact is...

507
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,300
I used to trap beaver.

508
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,500
But a few weeks ago I quit.
Never thought I would.

509
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,000
<i>Now I know it's wrong.</i>
<i>They're almost extinct.</i>

510
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,900
Too many trappers,
not enough beaver.

511
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,800
When the beaver have gone
from the north...

512
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:44,100
Maybe you don't know, but these little
fellas make the north the way it is.

513
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,500
They build their dams,
make their ponds...

514
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,400
<i>where the moose feed,</i>
<i>the muskrats, the waterfowl.</i>

515
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,600
Come the spring, they open up
their dams, let the meltwater run...

516
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:57,000
and you've got an irrigation system
a thousand miles wide.

517
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:01,600
Take away the beaver,
and you break the chain.

518
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,600
So I'm speakin' up
for the beaver now.

519
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,800
If we don't watch out,

520
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,900
there'll just be
another extinct species.

521
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:16,600
<i>I guess I feel it</i>
<i>more than most because...</i>

522
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,700
well, people like me are pretty much
an extinct species too.

523
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,400
I can guess you can
get along without me,

524
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,700
but these little fellas... the world
would be a poorer place without them.

525
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,500
What do you have to say?

526
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,700
Never ask me to do that again.

527
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,300
You were great, Archie.
You really got to them.

528
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,200
How 'bout a curtain call?

529
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,800
<i>Thank you.</i>

530
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:18,900
<i>It's wild country,</i>
<i>way north of the Saskatchewan River.</i>

531
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,400
<i>We build you a cabin</i>
<i>just the way you want it,</i>

532
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:24,300
and the National Parks Department
pays you a monthly salary.

533
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,300
-National park?
-Yeah.

534
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:31,100
All 3,000 square miles of it.

535
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,300
Why would I want to go there?

536
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,900
<i>You want to save the beaver?</i>

537
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,500
<i>You could do just that.</i>

538
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:43,000
Establish a colony...
no danger, trapping's forbidden.

539
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
<i>Jim wants the same as you, Archie...</i>

540
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,800
to save the beaver
before it's too late.

541
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,700
We need to get
the public on our side.

542
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:54,200
We need politicians to vote
funds for the parks.

543
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:57,000
And you could
really help us, Archie.

544
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:00,800
<i>And you'd be free to write.</i>

545
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,800
What's the problem?

546
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,800
It's made for you.

547
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:11,100
You know why I love
the forest?

548
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,800
I love the forest because it's
the last place men aren't in charge.

549
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,600
The last wilderness.

550
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,700
Why would I want to be
a park keeper?

551
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,200
Excuse me.

552
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,700
My name is Finney,
Cyrus Finney.

553
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,100
I was very taken by what Grey Owl
had to say this afternoon.

554
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,900
You obviously know him quite well.
Would you mind if I join you?

555
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,400
Did you know
he played piano?

556
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,800
I've heard him play.
Gimme that.

557
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,400
Where'd he learn that?
I mean, what else can he do?

558
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:34,200
Why doesn't he
tell me anything?

559
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:39,200
I've known Archie since I was four,
when my father adopted him.

560
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,000
I'd do anything for him,

561
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,700
but I'll never understand him,
even after all those years.

562
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,900
<i>Watch out.</i>

563
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,800
So he'll never
tell me anything.

564
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,600
Maybe not, but I'll tell you
two things:

565
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:55,200
Archie's past belongs
to him and only him,

566
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:59,100
and you... well, you've lasted longer
than any others.

567
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:03,200
<i>Night, Dave.</i>
<i>See ya in the mornin'.</i>

568
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,200
<i>Take it easy, Charlie.</i>

569
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,100
<i>Come on, hurry up.</i>

570
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:15,300
<i>Hey, Archie!</i>
<i>It's me, Sim Hancock.</i>

571
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,200
-Hey, Archie, it's that drunk again.
-Hey, wait a minute!

572
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,100
-Hey, it's me!
-What's happened to this place?

573
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:25,300
-Never used to be full of bums.
-I know it's you, ya bastard!

574
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,200
-<i>Remember me, Archie?</i>
-Where's Pony?

575
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,600
<i>I'll see ya, Charlie!</i>

576
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:32,300
You may have gone native,
but I know you!

577
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,200
-<i>I know it's you!</i>
-Go find Pony. Find her now, Ned.

578
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,200
It's time to get out of this place.
Tell her we're leaving.

579
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,600
Lake Ajawaan.
