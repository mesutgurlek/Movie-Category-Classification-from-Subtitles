1
00:01:51,057 --> 00:01:53,787
<i>Yes, sir, that's where
the sun takes his shoes off,</i>

2
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,956
<i>puts his feet up on the high Sierras,
and says, "Here's where I set down:"</i>

3
00:02:05,338 --> 00:02:06,965
<i>When the lord
finished this job,</i>

4
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,668
<i>he took a long look
and quit creatin':</i>

5
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:13,042
<i>Said, "From now on,
I'd just be repeatin' myself: "</i>

6
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:21,248
<i>Gee,
them trees is so big,</i>

7
00:02:21,321 --> 00:02:24,722
<i>you can carve yourself a Presbyterian
church out of any one of them:</i>

8
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:29,319
<i>Yeah, with enough wood left over for
a synagogue and a Baptist mission:</i>

9
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,303
<i>The soil is so rich,</i>

10
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:42,000
<i>one night a padre left his
spade standing up in the ground,</i>

11
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:45,909
<i>the next morning, there was
growing from the handle, apricots!</i>

12
00:02:54,554 --> 00:02:57,284
<i>Takes two men and a boy to see
clear to the top of them hills:</i>

13
00:02:57,357 --> 00:02:59,416
<i>A lady eagle
once tried to fly over:</i>

14
00:02:59,493 --> 00:03:03,020
<i>She got her tail caught and
couldn't lay an egg for a week:</i>

15
00:03:31,024 --> 00:03:33,356
<i>This place has got
everything but population:</i>

16
00:03:33,426 --> 00:03:35,951
<i>Sister, pack up
your washboard:</i>

17
00:04:32,586 --> 00:04:33,985
That's mine.

18
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:49,834
Come on now,
throw her out of here!

19
00:04:49,903 --> 00:04:51,871
We don't want
the likes of her with us.

20
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:52,996
Here's your belongings!

21
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:54,062
Keep going.

22
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:58,471
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

23
00:04:58,712 --> 00:04:59,974
Get going.

24
00:05:00,046 --> 00:05:01,980
Come on, Lil.
I'll give you a hand.

25
00:05:02,048 --> 00:05:03,777
Get her out of here!

26
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:08,179
Let's get over to the stage. It's
heading east in about ten minutes.

27
00:05:08,254 --> 00:05:09,380
East?
That's where I came from!

28
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:12,687
We don't care where you came
from or where you go, just get!

29
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,226
Come on, Lil.

30
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:18,758
Go on, keep going!

31
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:20,657
Who's the boss of
this wagon train?

32
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:22,090
I am.

33
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,268
How about a lift
to California?

34
00:05:26,773 --> 00:05:27,762
Not a chance.

35
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:32,278
Ah, Mr. Trumbo, if there's room for all
of us, there's room for one more of us.

36
00:05:32,345 --> 00:05:35,940
If this girl wants to go to California,
she can ride in my wagon, and welcome.

37
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:39,281
Then you'll be traveling with
wickedness and mortal sin, mister.

38
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:43,345
I'm warning you, cards ain't
the only thing she cheats at.

39
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:44,412
That's right.

40
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:46,425
I'm glad indeed to see
that you good women

41
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:49,018
are dead set against
wickedness and mortal sin.

42
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:51,495
Now, if she was at all pretty,
there'd be something to worry about,

43
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:53,395
but she doesn't
look pretty to me.

44
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:56,924
Fabian, I think I've got something to
say about that, and I say she doesn't go.

45
00:05:57,003 --> 00:05:58,994
She can pay her way, if
that's what you're a-thinkin'.

46
00:05:59,072 --> 00:06:00,403
That isn't what
I'm thinking.

47
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:01,997
Then what are
you thinking?

48
00:06:02,075 --> 00:06:03,940
For $1000 cash on delivery,

49
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,638
I've guaranteed to lay this outfit
down in California, all of a piece.

50
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:08,544
There'll be troubles enough.

51
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:11,243
Who are you afraid of?
Me or yourself?

52
00:06:11,818 --> 00:06:13,615
I don't care what kind of
baggage we carry,

53
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:16,247
only I don't want the boys
fighting over it.

54
00:06:16,322 --> 00:06:18,552
You say there's trouble
ahead of us, Mr. Trumbo.

55
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,217
Now, these good women know

56
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:22,853
it's help from divine providence
we'll be needing there.

57
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:24,658
And by doing
one good deed now,

58
00:06:24,731 --> 00:06:26,289
we'll have providence
on our side.

59
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:29,995
We should give help where help is needed.
Isn't that what the good book says?

60
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,471
I'm with you, Mr. Fabian. A small
investment in the almighty now

61
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,065
is liable to pay off big
later on, when we need it.

62
00:06:36,142 --> 00:06:38,633
Then it's all settled and she
comes with us, Mr. Trumbo.

63
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:40,805
It's your outfit, Fabian.
I just work here.

64
00:06:42,482 --> 00:06:47,215
Hey you, missy. Don't get no ideas you're
a-comin' 'cause we want you. We don't.

65
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:50,313
You're only comin' because
Mr. Fabian says so, see?

66
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,914
Come on, child.

67
00:07:17,217 --> 00:07:19,515
My turn, Mr. Trumbo!
No, it's mine, isn't it?

68
00:07:19,586 --> 00:07:21,417
Yeah, it's your turn with
the saddle, Johnny.

69
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:22,477
Thanks, Mr. Trumbo.

70
00:07:22,655 --> 00:07:24,589
Joe, you take care of his
feed, huh? What about me?

71
00:07:24,657 --> 00:07:27,023
It'll be your turn tomorrow night,
and maybe I'll even let you ride him.

72
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:28,856
Thanks, Mr. Trumbo!

73
00:07:29,028 --> 00:07:30,154
Bob.

74
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:37,058
Hey, Reb.
Yeah?

75
00:07:37,137 --> 00:07:39,002
Better check this rim,
or you'll be on three wheels.

76
00:07:39,072 --> 00:07:40,699
Sure will, Johnny.

77
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:46,244
Why, hello, Elwyn. That's an
awful lot of gun you've got there.

78
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:47,540
This is Indian
country, isn't it?

79
00:07:47,614 --> 00:07:48,706
Yeah, well don't plug me!

80
00:07:48,782 --> 00:07:50,807
Aw, it isn't even
loaded yet. Look.

81
00:07:52,118 --> 00:07:53,107
Whoa! Pick yourself up.

82
00:07:54,254 --> 00:07:57,052
Doggone your hide, Elwyn! Now
you've been and woke the baby.

83
00:07:57,123 --> 00:07:59,683
Aw, don't be too hard on him, Mrs.
Brown. We need a lot of men like him.

84
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,784
Oh, come on, get your gun.

85
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:08,734
You sent for us, Johnny?
Oh, yes, Abe.

86
00:08:08,802 --> 00:08:10,736
You and Whitey better get
around to your sections

87
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:12,066
and warn 'em to
go easy on the water.

88
00:08:12,138 --> 00:08:13,799
The next two days
is a long dry haul.

89
00:08:13,873 --> 00:08:15,602
Right away, Johnny.

90
00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:28,252
What do you think you're
doing? That's water.

91
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:30,319
I thought it was molasses.

92
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,119
And where do you think
we get it, whistle for it?

93
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:34,990
That's two days rations there,
and you're washing your hair in it.

94
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:38,360
I ought to make you drink it.
How am I supposed to keep clean?

95
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:40,763
Stay dirty,
like the rest of us.

96
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,904
How're your grapes, Grandpa?
Are your cuttings dry?

97
00:08:49,976 --> 00:08:52,274
Yeah, dry,
they're pitifully dry.

98
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:55,848
Mr. Trumbo, I heard you
talking to Miss Lily.

99
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:58,549
Am I right in thinking you
were a little harsh with her?

100
00:08:58,618 --> 00:09:02,577
I'm harsh with everybody, I've got to be.
The soft ones don't make it to California.

101
00:09:02,655 --> 00:09:05,624
Maybe you think it's easy hauling
you farmers over the trail.

102
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:07,387
I'd rather ride herd
on some buffalo.

103
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,088
Then why did you hire
yourself out as a guide?

104
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:12,461
I often wondered that about
you. You're not the type.

105
00:09:12,532 --> 00:09:14,659
Maybe I like to keep moving.

106
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:16,666
You know
Missouri at all?

107
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:17,998
Yeah, I've been
through it.

108
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:20,835
I had a vineyard there once.
It's good earth.

109
00:09:20,907 --> 00:09:22,772
Great earth, fine earth.

110
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:24,571
If you like it so well,
why'd you leave it?

111
00:09:24,644 --> 00:09:29,877
Because I want the sun, the sun of
California. Not for meself, for me grapes.

112
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:34,477
They catch the sun and save it,
and then they let loose the warmth

113
00:09:34,554 --> 00:09:37,250
in the heart of man when
he drinks the wine they make.

114
00:09:37,323 --> 00:09:40,486
Don't look much like grapes to me.
They look like a bunch of dead sticks.

115
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,688
From those dead sticks
I've seen many a miracle rise.

116
00:09:43,763 --> 00:09:47,722
Every spring in my vineyard, I've seen
them bursting out into glorious life,

117
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,825
and I'll see it again,
please God, in California.

118
00:09:49,903 --> 00:09:51,200
You're not in California yet.

119
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:54,934
Well, with God's help and
yours, we'll be there one day.

120
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:58,876
From these dead sticks there'll be
thousands of acres of grape vines,

121
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:01,937
covering the hills like
a great green blessing.

122
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:05,079
Well, well. Slick and shiny
as a new saddle.

123
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:06,743
Where are you going,
Pennock, to a dance?

124
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:10,186
At our present rate of travel,
I'd say nobody was going anywhere.

125
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:14,556
Look, for the past 17 days, we've been
crawling across this empty desolation.

126
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:16,254
How much longer
is it going to take?

127
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:20,459
Well, I figure it's now about
7:00. With good luck, no bad storms,

128
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:23,798
no Indian attacks,
no sick folks or sick stock,

129
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,395
well, I should think we'd be
in California before snow flies.

130
00:10:26,472 --> 00:10:27,837
I'm serious.
So am I.

131
00:10:27,907 --> 00:10:30,205
We're all in a hurry to
get where we're going.

132
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:34,770
Mr. Pennock as well as the rest of us.
Though perhaps his reasons are different.

133
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:37,315
You don't look like a farming
man, Mr. Pennock.

134
00:10:37,383 --> 00:10:39,908
Sometimes I wonder
why you're here at all.

135
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:40,975
I'm here on business.

136
00:10:41,054 --> 00:10:44,046
Business? Well, that
covers a lot of ground.

137
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:48,088
I suppose there'll be more of your kind
following the farmers to California.

138
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:50,493
It'll be the next state
in the Union, God willing.

139
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:52,895
In these dangerous times,
Mr. Fabian,

140
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:55,867
I wouldn't be so sure there'll be
a Union left for California to join.

141
00:10:55,935 --> 00:10:59,200
We don't need that kind of talk,
Mr. Pennock. Not on this train.

142
00:10:59,272 --> 00:11:01,399
Only a fool would say these
are not dangerous times.

143
00:11:01,474 --> 00:11:02,941
A little grease on
your tongue, Pennock.

144
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:05,705
Keep out of this, mule skinner.
What do you know about politics?

145
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:08,372
Why, nothing, Pennock.
Nothing at all.

146
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:12,382
We've got people with this outfit from
Ohio and Kentucky, Wisconsin and Georgia,

147
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:14,818
and from states
both North and South.

148
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:17,287
And they're getting
along fine, understand?

149
00:11:17,357 --> 00:11:18,756
So if you have any more of
that talk in you,

150
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:20,656
you'd better
say it to yourself.

151
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:24,322
When we get to California, you can all
tear your hearts out, for all I care.

152
00:11:24,397 --> 00:11:26,558
Me, I'll be having
a long drink.

153
00:11:26,632 --> 00:11:31,035
But until then, I'm telling you, keep
your mouth shut and your nose clean.

154
00:11:42,382 --> 00:11:47,445
<i>Oh, I should have stood
in Massachusetts</i>

155
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,183
<i>Massachusetts, Massachusetts</i>

156
00:11:51,257 --> 00:11:54,886
<i>M, A, Massachusetts</i>

157
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:58,727
<i>Roll along and roll along
and roll and go</i>

158
00:11:58,798 --> 00:12:02,165
<i>Oh, away out West</i>

159
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:03,930
<i>Away out West</i>

160
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:07,666
<i>Beyond the great unknowns</i>

161
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,834
<i>The buzzards crave my liver</i>

162
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:15,006
<i>The coyotes are
out for my bones</i>

163
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:18,744
<i>If it hadn't been
for the bloomin' law</i>

164
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:22,310
<i>and a wench with
a delicate ear</i>

165
00:12:22,388 --> 00:12:25,983
<i>I wouldn't have had
to leave the States</i>

166
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:28,960
<i>to be a pioneer:::</i>

167
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:43,466
Huh!

168
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:01,956
You better take care
of your eyes.

169
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:03,689
You'll go blind trying to
read in that light.

170
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:04,957
Aw, no.

171
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:11,061
You want to listen to this for a bit
and forget about those women out there?

172
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:16,098
"A land of wheat
and barley and vineyards,

173
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:20,202
"wherein fig trees and
pomegranates and olive yards grow.

174
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,645
"A land of oil and honey,

175
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:27,743
"where without any want, thou shall eat thy
bread and enjoy abundance of all things. "

176
00:13:28,654 --> 00:13:30,281
Somebody else going
to California?

177
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:32,790
No, this was
thousands of years ago.

178
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:34,850
They were
the children of Israel,

179
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:39,057
and God was leading them over the
River Jordan to the Promised Land.

180
00:13:39,298 --> 00:13:41,289
They're mighty pretty words.

181
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:44,825
Pretty words, pretty names.
I know lots of names.

182
00:13:45,705 --> 00:13:50,142
Natchez, Memphis, Savannah, Biloxi,
New Orleans. They're pretty names.

183
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:54,441
But they're places that
can break your heart, too.

184
00:13:54,981 --> 00:13:56,710
None of them had room
for Lily Bishop.

185
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:58,814
California will
have room for you.

186
00:14:00,086 --> 00:14:02,213
I'll find a place somewhere.

187
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:05,682
And nobody can throw me out.
Nobody.

188
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:11,825
I'm grateful to you for taking
me along to the Promised Land.

189
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:12,920
What did you call it?

190
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:17,032
The book calls it Canaan,
but we call it California.

191
00:14:18,037 --> 00:14:20,972
Now mind what I say,
don't let them hurt you.

192
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:23,800
Now go to sleep,
child, go to sleep.

193
00:14:24,177 --> 00:14:25,166
Yeah, sure.

194
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:27,872
They didn't hurt.

195
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:30,213
They can't.

196
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:33,441
Goodnight.
Goodnight, child.

197
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,753
Whoa!

198
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:17,318
It's good to see the
soldiers out here. Sure is.

199
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:20,957
Lily, Abe baked some cornbread last night,
I'll bet they'd sure like some of it.

200
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:22,500
I'll ask 'em.

201
00:15:23,102 --> 00:15:24,694
Howdy.
Hey.

202
00:15:25,304 --> 00:15:26,293
Where's your guide?

203
00:15:26,372 --> 00:15:28,340
He went ahead to
scout around a bit.

204
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:30,102
Trumbo back yet? Ain't
seen him, Michael.

205
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:32,804
Well, maybe you can tell me.
How's the water hole at Salt Lick?

206
00:15:32,878 --> 00:15:36,075
A horse could be up to his knees in
it when we left, it was that deep.

207
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:39,083
Good. Trumbo you say
his name was? Trumbo.

208
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:41,346
That's an unusual name. He
wouldn't have a brother, would he?

209
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,047
Never spoke to me
of any brother.

210
00:15:43,122 --> 00:15:47,286
I knew a lieutenant by that name once.
Campaigned with him. Good soldier, too.

211
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,694
Not the kind you'd expect to become
a deserter. Well, keep to the trail.

212
00:15:57,303 --> 00:15:58,736
Still taking nourishment, huh?

213
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:01,500
There's no hardship can
kill the life that's in them.

214
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:03,041
I feel I ought to
take off me hat

215
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:05,509
to these little dead sticks,
as you once called them.

216
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:08,069
Yeah, they still look
like it to me.

217
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:10,212
Johnny, we never
mentioned such things,

218
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:11,807
but have you any
brothers at all?

219
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:12,976
No.

220
00:16:13,052 --> 00:16:16,954
And if it isn't too nosy on my
part, were you ever in the army?

221
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:19,918
What makes you ask that?

222
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:23,985
Just an old man maundering about the
things that are none of his business.

223
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,463
Look, you hired me to take you
to California, didn't you?

224
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:27,521
I did.

225
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,589
I'll take you there.

226
00:16:28,968 --> 00:16:30,435
But if you've got any
questions to ask,

227
00:16:30,503 --> 00:16:32,368
you should've asked them
before you hired me.

228
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:34,406
No questions, Johnny.
No questions.

229
00:16:34,473 --> 00:16:35,462
Good.

230
00:16:41,547 --> 00:16:43,208
Should have stood in Michigan.

231
00:16:43,282 --> 00:16:44,681
Me, too.
I pass.

232
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,274
See you, Lil.
Three jacks.

233
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:47,717
That wins.

234
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:48,776
Fellas, I'm blue.

235
00:16:48,854 --> 00:16:50,549
Still got your pants,
haven't you?

236
00:16:50,623 --> 00:16:53,922
Yes, but I'd hate to go home
to the missus without 'em.

237
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:55,654
Want to take
his place, Trumbo?

238
00:16:55,728 --> 00:16:57,559
Not me.
Saving your money, huh?

239
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,030
Johnny ain't saving his money,
he ain't got it yet.

240
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:02,624
Come on, Johnny.
Maybe you can break her luck.

241
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:04,067
Maybe he can, maybe he can't.

242
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:07,230
Perhaps Mr. Trumbo prefers
some simpler pastime.

243
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:10,398
You can tame her, Johnny.

244
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:14,042
What'll it be this time, boys?
Half a dollar too steep?

245
00:17:14,113 --> 00:17:16,638
Abe, looks like
it might get excitin'.

246
00:17:16,716 --> 00:17:18,809
Too excitin' for me, Pokey.

247
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:26,023
Pass blind.
I'll bet a dollar.

248
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,553
I pass.

249
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:30,492
Got a dollar, Trumbo?

250
00:17:31,664 --> 00:17:32,653
Raise it a dollar.

251
00:17:32,732 --> 00:17:33,721
I'll play out.

252
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:34,925
Pass.

253
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:37,794
Well, it's just you and me.

254
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,363
Your dollar and three more.

255
00:17:49,181 --> 00:17:52,207
That's enough for me.
You're expensive company, Lil.

256
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:53,308
Too hot for me.

257
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:55,616
Still want to climb those
golden stairs, Trumbo?

258
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:57,679
Looks like he's
fallin' down 'em!

259
00:17:57,757 --> 00:17:58,746
I'll raise you five.

260
00:17:58,824 --> 00:17:59,813
I'll call you.

261
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:02,455
Straight.

262
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:05,152
Full house.

263
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:06,220
That does it.

264
00:18:11,937 --> 00:18:14,906
They're not marked, if that's what
you're thinking. But look at them anyway.

265
00:18:14,974 --> 00:18:16,908
A little something you learned
at your mother's knee, huh?

266
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:18,034
No, my father's.

267
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,806
He was a gambler, played
the Mississippi riverboats.

268
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,442
He always used to say, "It's your cheat
who's most afraid of being cheated. "

269
00:18:26,218 --> 00:18:27,810
Better stay on your horse
after this, Trumbo.

270
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:30,913
It makes you look a lot more
important than you really are.

271
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,254
Another thing my
father told me.

272
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:36,317
Always leave a man
burying money. Here.

273
00:18:46,705 --> 00:18:47,967
What do you want?

274
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,270
Came to give you back
your burying money.

275
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:53,776
I need any favors from you,
I'll ask for them.

276
00:18:53,846 --> 00:18:56,440
Aren't you afraid that people
will see you? Come in.

277
00:18:57,616 --> 00:18:58,913
Sit down.

278
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:04,648
Took you a long time to
make up your mind, didn't it?

279
00:19:04,723 --> 00:19:06,088
What do you mean,
make up my mind?

280
00:19:06,158 --> 00:19:07,955
Why don't you admit that
back in Pawnee Flat

281
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:10,825
there was something
else you were afraid of?

282
00:19:10,896 --> 00:19:12,830
You know, for a woman,
you're pretty smart.

283
00:19:12,898 --> 00:19:15,093
I am smart. Too smart.

284
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:18,568
I know too much. A woman
gets tired knowing too much.

285
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:22,063
Sometimes she likes
to be surprised.

286
00:19:23,442 --> 00:19:25,069
Like this, maybe?

287
00:19:33,118 --> 00:19:35,609
That was what you wanted,
wasn't it?

288
00:19:35,688 --> 00:19:38,486
Well, that's exactly what
you're not going to get.

289
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:41,890
Oh, so now you're
paying me off, huh?

290
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:44,088
You sat like judgment
on your horse.

291
00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:46,461
What did you think when I was
on my hands in the dust?

292
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:48,932
I can tell you what you
thought. I know what you thought.

293
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:50,161
You didn't wait
for any proof.

294
00:19:50,236 --> 00:19:53,728
No, no, you knew. You
knew just by looking at me.

295
00:19:53,806 --> 00:19:56,366
But you're not a
hard man to figure.

296
00:19:56,442 --> 00:19:59,468
All these weeks when you were trying
to shame me, trying to break my heart,

297
00:19:59,545 --> 00:20:02,105
that was your way
of making love to me.

298
00:20:02,181 --> 00:20:04,081
Then you come in here and
expect me to fall in your arms

299
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:06,947
and be thankful for
the favor you're doing me.

300
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:11,683
You may think you're pretty high and
mighty, Trumbo, but let me tell you this.

301
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:15,725
If I live long enough,
and I will,

302
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:19,692
I'm going to pull you down off
that fancy horse of yours

303
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:22,393
and shove your face
in the muck.

304
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:24,826
So help me.

305
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:30,965
Trumbo, Trumbo!

306
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:32,738
Trumbo!
Where is Trumbo?

307
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:33,800
Trumbo?

308
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,245
You better go, Trumbo.

309
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:37,441
Trumbo!

310
00:20:37,516 --> 00:20:38,608
Trumbo!

311
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,114
Here he comes now.

312
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:44,513
What's all
the hollering about?

313
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,353
They've struck it rich
in California. Gold!

314
00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:47,585
These men just
brought the news.

315
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,423
Gold!
That's right, gold.

316
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:51,087
Where? Somewhere's out of Sacramento.

317
00:20:51,163 --> 00:20:52,596
Place called Sutter's Mill.

318
00:20:52,665 --> 00:20:55,361
They're always finding gold in
California, but nobody ever saw it.

319
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:57,299
Well, it's straight this time.

320
00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:00,031
Well, we're headed for California. If
you like, you can string along with us.

321
00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:01,265
No thanks, mister.

322
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,070
We'll take a bed for the night and
something to eat, and thank you for it.

323
00:21:04,143 --> 00:21:05,667
But we ain't waitin'
for no wagon wheels.

324
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:08,838
We aim to get to California
while there's still standing room.

325
00:21:08,914 --> 00:21:10,279
As you like.

326
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:13,978
I'll lend you a blanket, partner.
Just tell me some more about that gold.

327
00:21:14,053 --> 00:21:15,748
Gold in California.

328
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:17,982
Oh, Johnny, that's news
I don't like to hear.

329
00:21:18,057 --> 00:21:19,490
But it's big news,
Grandpa.

330
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:20,547
Gold, I hate the word.

331
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:23,457
It'll bring us nothing
but murder and greed.

332
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:26,828
They steal it out of the ground,
they steal it from one another.

333
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:30,062
It's a curse on us that
those men brought us the news.

334
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:33,195
Look what it's done already. Look
at their faces, look at their eyes.

335
00:21:46,752 --> 00:21:49,312
<i>This is your big chance, Paddy,
but it won't do you no good</i>

336
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:51,117
<i>if everybody gets
there before you:</i>

337
00:22:01,033 --> 00:22:03,024
<i>The whole world is gonna
be knowin' about this soon:</i>

338
00:22:03,102 --> 00:22:05,229
<i>That's too many
people to suit me:</i>

339
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:14,505
Jessie, use your brains
and stay with the train!

340
00:23:14,573 --> 00:23:17,542
Get away from here, Trumbo.
All right, have it your way!

341
00:23:20,713 --> 00:23:22,613
Better another month on the
trail than leave that here, Slim.

342
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:23,841
You'll need that plow.

343
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:27,352
I'll buy me a new one in
California. Gold plated, too.

344
00:23:35,828 --> 00:23:37,318
You leaving Fabian's wagon?

345
00:23:37,396 --> 00:23:41,560
I am. Nobody's going to
get to California ahead of me.

346
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:44,124
Lil, I suppose you've got
plenty of reasons to hate me,

347
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:46,967
but I don't want to see
anything happen to you.

348
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,234
And this wagon train breaking
up, it's liable to be dangerous.

349
00:23:49,308 --> 00:23:51,276
I'll take my chances.

350
00:23:51,343 --> 00:23:54,403
Before you go, there's
something I'd like to say.

351
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,880
About last night, I mean, I...

352
00:23:56,949 --> 00:24:00,510
Speak up, Trumbo. I might begin to
think you're not sure of yourself.

353
00:24:00,586 --> 00:24:03,316
Well, about hitting you,
I'm sorry.

354
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:05,654
I'm trying to apologize.

355
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:08,784
We're ready to go, Lil.
Is that all you've got?

356
00:24:09,428 --> 00:24:11,191
You going with him?

357
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:14,232
Yeah, is there anything
to say about it?

358
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,322
No.

359
00:24:15,968 --> 00:24:18,198
Except I almost
made a mistake.

360
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:35,544
Whoa! Whoa!

361
00:24:37,222 --> 00:24:39,247
Just a minute, Pennock...

362
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:52,259
Ah, the murdering gold. Look around
you, look at all they've thrown away.

363
00:24:52,704 --> 00:24:57,368
Plows, books,
furniture of all kinds.

364
00:24:58,877 --> 00:25:04,110
Stoves, spinning wheels, and all the
tools they need to build a home. Huh.

365
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:07,383
Galloping after gold,
they are. What good is it?

366
00:25:07,452 --> 00:25:10,649
Ah, the lasting thing is planting
the ground, making things grow

367
00:25:10,722 --> 00:25:15,216
generation after generation. That's
lasting, and there's contentment in it.

368
00:25:15,561 --> 00:25:19,327
Easy, rest easy, now. It's that
little bone in there, I think.

369
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:22,731
It'll not be better tomorrow or the
day after. That'll take time to mend.

370
00:25:22,801 --> 00:25:25,964
Seven hundred miles of God's empty
wilderness between us and California,

371
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:27,938
and this had to happen.

372
00:25:28,106 --> 00:25:30,438
I'm sorry, Gramps, looks like
I'll be holding you back.

373
00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:31,737
I'm in no hurry.

374
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,107
The earth and the sun
and the soil

375
00:25:33,178 --> 00:25:34,975
will still be there
when we get there, Johnny.

376
00:25:35,047 --> 00:25:37,845
Yeah, but not the gold,
Grandpa, not the gold.

377
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:40,714
And what about my $1000? Who's going
to pay that? What am I gonna do?

378
00:25:40,786 --> 00:25:44,085
You take it easy till we're
ready to hit the trail again.

379
00:25:44,156 --> 00:25:46,989
I'm in charge now,
and those are my orders.

380
00:25:53,532 --> 00:25:56,262
Well, Johnny,
we're on our way. Hup, hup!

381
00:26:39,978 --> 00:26:41,502
Whoa.

382
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,845
Now, Johnny, you can get a bath and
a drink. I'll look after your horse.

383
00:26:44,917 --> 00:26:47,181
I'll help you unhitch, Grandpa,
and you better come with me.

384
00:26:47,252 --> 00:26:49,447
No, no, there's a little
friend here I have to consult.

385
00:26:49,521 --> 00:26:50,749
Thought you didn't
like liquor.

386
00:26:50,822 --> 00:26:52,881
This isn't liquor,
this is brandy.

387
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:55,950
Made from the grapes
themselves. Here, try it.

388
00:26:56,261 --> 00:26:59,128
The golden elixir,
the life for all men.

389
00:27:00,365 --> 00:27:01,957
Life?
That's a mortal enemy.

390
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:04,559
I forgot you were
only a growing boy.

391
00:27:06,438 --> 00:27:09,464
Johnny, if you come back and find me
talking, I'll be talking to meself.

392
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:11,634
Just put me
to bed peacefully.

393
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:14,235
Go on and enjoy yourself.
Go on!

394
00:27:41,974 --> 00:27:44,738
So, you made it, Trumbo.
Where's Lily?

395
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,778
Haven't you seen her?
No.

396
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,906
You will, Trumbo.

397
00:27:50,282 --> 00:27:51,544
You will.

398
00:27:52,084 --> 00:27:54,109
I'm asking you,
where is she?

399
00:27:54,186 --> 00:27:56,347
You can't get her off
your mind, can you?

400
00:27:56,421 --> 00:27:58,218
There's a lot of things
I can't get off my mind,

401
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,451
but I'm taking 'em
one at a time.

402
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:05,428
You know, Trumbo, if ever you grow up, you'll
learn that a woman is like a poker game.

403
00:28:05,497 --> 00:28:07,465
What you take in one hand,
you drop in the next.

404
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:09,466
You were never in this game.

405
00:28:09,534 --> 00:28:13,265
I thought I was, for a while,
but I lost to a heavier bid.

406
00:28:13,338 --> 00:28:15,306
What do you mean by that?

407
00:28:15,374 --> 00:28:18,434
If you want a drink,
you better order it now.

408
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:21,579
Our entertainer doesn't like
drinks served while she's singing.

409
00:28:21,646 --> 00:28:23,045
Whiskey.
Whiskey.

410
00:28:23,115 --> 00:28:24,548
Same for me.

411
00:28:31,723 --> 00:28:34,351
<i>Who runs the cleanest
gambling house?</i>

412
00:28:34,426 --> 00:28:36,792
<i>Too-rye, too-rye,
fa-da-linka-dye-do</i>

413
00:28:36,862 --> 00:28:40,059
<i>Who runs the cleanest
gambling house?</i>

414
00:28:41,633 --> 00:28:43,999
<i>Who runs the cleanest
gambling house?</i>

415
00:28:44,069 --> 00:28:45,093
<i>Come in like a lion</i>

416
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,535
<i>Leave clean as a mouse</i>

417
00:28:46,605 --> 00:28:48,732
<i>Lily-I, Lily-I-Oh</i>

418
00:28:49,908 --> 00:28:52,604
<i>The mining man,

419
00:28:52,677 --> 00:28:54,838
<i>Too-rye, too-rye,

420
00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:57,404
<i>The mining man,
he digs for gold</i>

421
00:28:57,482 --> 00:28:58,847
<i>Dig!</i>

422
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:02,017
<i>The mining man,
he digs for gold</i>

423
00:29:02,087 --> 00:29:04,749
<i>But it winds up here
in my billfold</i>

424
00:29:04,823 --> 00:29:09,089
<i>Lily-I, Lily-I-Oh, oh,
oh, Lily-I, Lily-I-Oh</i>

425
00:29:10,695 --> 00:29:13,255
<i>A lumberjack,

<i>Too-rye, too-rye,

427
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:19,467
<i>The lumberjack,

428
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:23,007
<i>The lumberjack,

429
00:29:23,075 --> 00:29:25,339
<i>The lumber's his,
but the jack is mine</i>

430
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:30,473
<i>Lily-I, Lily-I-Oh, oh,

00:29:31,349 --> 00:29:34,011
<i>A respectable girl,

432
00:29:34,086 --> 00:29:36,316
<i>Too-rye, too-rye,

434
00:29:38,924 --> 00:29:39,913
<i>Ugh!</i>

435
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:43,527
<i>A respectable girl,
she marries soon</i>

436
00:29:43,595 --> 00:29:46,189
<i>But the groom comes here
for his honeymoon</i>

437
00:29:46,264 --> 00:29:51,133
<i>Lily-I, Lily-I-Oh, oh,
oh, Lily-I, Lily-I-Oh</i>

438
00:29:55,073 --> 00:29:58,440
Wonderful, Lily.
Wonderful as usual.

439
00:30:06,218 --> 00:30:07,480
Singin' pretty, ain't she?

440
00:30:07,552 --> 00:30:08,541
That she is.

441
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:12,190
Sit down, Pike.
Mr. Pike, Mr. Trumbo.

442
00:30:12,424 --> 00:30:14,619
Howdy.
Sailor, huh?

443
00:30:14,693 --> 00:30:17,184
Ain't no stinkin'
scurvy landlubber.

444
00:30:19,164 --> 00:30:23,726
Pike, one of these days, someone's just
naturally going to spit in your eye.

445
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:26,303
Doggone my britches,
Johnny Trumbo!

446
00:30:26,371 --> 00:30:27,895
Whitey! So you
made it, huh?

447
00:30:27,973 --> 00:30:29,497
Yeah, but a lot
of 'em didn't.

448
00:30:29,574 --> 00:30:31,474
You strike it rich yet?

449
00:30:31,543 --> 00:30:32,567
Strike it rich?

450
00:30:32,644 --> 00:30:35,010
Ask that thievin' gouger. He
can tell you better than me.

451
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,106
Go ahead and ask them, Johnny.
Him and his Captain Coffin!

452
00:30:38,183 --> 00:30:39,377
Watch your lip, farmer.

453
00:30:39,451 --> 00:30:40,440
Not no more, I won't.

454
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:43,818
Likely, I'll get my teeth bashed
in, but not afore I spoke my piece.

455
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:45,481
Come on, Whitey.

456
00:30:47,492 --> 00:30:49,722
I ain't makin' out
good at all, Johnny.

457
00:30:49,794 --> 00:30:52,194
I come out west expecting
to find a free country,

458
00:30:52,264 --> 00:30:54,357
and instead I find
a shark named Coffin,

459
00:30:54,432 --> 00:30:56,491
squeezin' the lifeblood
out of the place.

460
00:30:56,568 --> 00:30:59,401
To work my claim,
I gotta buy water from Coffin.

461
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:04,033
I thought water belonged to God almighty,
but no, you gotta pay for every drop.

462
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:08,546
I gotta buy Coffin's vittles at Coffin's
prices. I gotta buy my tools off him.

463
00:31:08,613 --> 00:31:11,548
$100 for one little shovel.
Shut up.

464
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,016
Because I got a wife and kids
back east, I do all this.

465
00:31:14,085 --> 00:31:18,112
I go into debt up to my ears to Coffin,
let him take the shirt off of my back!

466
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,124
Shut up.
He's talking to me.

467
00:31:20,192 --> 00:31:24,185
Day before yesterday, my claim
starts to pay out. Pay out good.

468
00:31:24,596 --> 00:31:28,589
Right then, Coffin and his gang jumps
it, says they're foreclosing for debt.

469
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:31,261
Drive me off of the place
with pick handles!

470
00:31:32,637 --> 00:31:33,626
You!

471
00:31:57,429 --> 00:31:58,760
What's the damage this time?

472
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,627
Just a chair and a table.

473
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:03,862
Sorry, Miss Lily. I'm beginning to think
you're too expensive to have around.

474
00:32:03,935 --> 00:32:05,766
It takes a long time
to get furniture out here.

475
00:32:05,837 --> 00:32:07,964
Lily, an old acquaintance,

476
00:32:10,008 --> 00:32:12,101
slightly in need of repair.

477
00:32:12,377 --> 00:32:14,208
Shall I throw him out?

478
00:32:15,614 --> 00:32:18,014
No. Bring him back here.

479
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:38,358
I'm glad to see
you're still living.

480
00:32:42,707 --> 00:32:46,234
Well, I suppose I should thank
you for taking care of me.

481
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:50,041
I told you once before
how I felt about you.

482
00:32:50,115 --> 00:32:52,913
Nothing's happened
to make any difference.

483
00:32:53,218 --> 00:32:55,083
Or have you forgotten?

484
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:58,616
No, I haven't forgotten, Lil.

485
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:02,718
But I'm just beginning
to understand something.

486
00:33:03,461 --> 00:33:07,420
No woman can go around hating a
man the way you say you hate me.

487
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,526
Not unless there's
something else on her mind.

488
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:15,036
Babble on, Mr. Trumbo.

489
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:17,998
But this I'll tell you.

490
00:33:18,543 --> 00:33:20,602
If you ever so much as
set foot in here again,

491
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:23,739
I'll have a better man
than Pike throw you out.

492
00:33:23,948 --> 00:33:27,145
You talk awful big,
like maybe you own the place.

493
00:33:29,254 --> 00:33:30,380
I do.

494
00:33:31,556 --> 00:33:34,081
Maybe I shouldn't ask
how you got it.

495
00:33:35,393 --> 00:33:37,418
How do you think I got it?

496
00:33:39,764 --> 00:33:42,358
What I'm thinkin'
you wouldn't like.

497
00:33:44,369 --> 00:33:47,202
Yeah, nothing too good for
our Lil. Straight out of China.

498
00:33:47,272 --> 00:33:50,833
He must be quite a man to
stake you to a layout like this.

499
00:33:52,243 --> 00:33:53,676
Ah, a brig.

500
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:56,411
Nice shear.

501
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:59,210
For a mule skinner, you seem
to know a lot about ships.

502
00:33:59,284 --> 00:34:02,845
My father was first mate on
a whaler. Yeah, she's pretty.

503
00:34:03,555 --> 00:34:06,251
Congo Queen,
Pharaoh Coffin, Master.

504
00:34:06,324 --> 00:34:10,124
Coffin, now there's a name I
keep hearing. Whitey, he said it.

505
00:34:10,328 --> 00:34:13,764
Pharaoh Coffin. There's an
echo in my mind some place.

506
00:34:14,065 --> 00:34:16,329
Congo Queen?

507
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:17,663
I've got it!

508
00:34:17,736 --> 00:34:21,638
Sure, she's pretty, pretty as a
picture. Fast, too. She had to be.

509
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,707
Now I understand everything.

510
00:34:23,775 --> 00:34:25,902
Something amuse
you, friend?

511
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:31,475
No, don't tell me.

512
00:34:31,549 --> 00:34:34,109
I've never laid eyes on you
before, nor you on me.

513
00:34:34,185 --> 00:34:37,211
But I'll bet you a dollar to one of
your brass buttons that you're Coffin.

514
00:34:37,288 --> 00:34:38,619
Captain Pharaoh Coffin.

515
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:42,922
And I lay a dollar to what's left of your
manners that you're Mr. Jonathan Trumbo.

516
00:34:42,994 --> 00:34:44,086
Ah, Pike told you.

517
00:34:44,162 --> 00:34:45,390
No, Pennock.

518
00:34:45,463 --> 00:34:48,159
Well, you're a long ways from
Africa, Captain, and the slave trade.

519
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:49,791
Only fools stayed in
the African trade.

520
00:34:49,868 --> 00:34:51,301
Why should I crowd my ship
with live cargo

521
00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:53,360
when I can get more for a
shovel than I can for a Black?

522
00:34:53,438 --> 00:34:55,736
Or by running helpless little men
off their claims with pick handles.

523
00:34:55,807 --> 00:35:00,073
These are fast-moving times, friend.
Helpless little men have no place in them.

524
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:03,512
This is an odd place, though, to find
a man who remembers the old Congo Queen.

525
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:05,606
Fine ship. Fine name.

526
00:35:05,683 --> 00:35:08,379
I remember her. Not for her name,
though, but for the blood on her decks

527
00:35:08,453 --> 00:35:10,648
and the smell of the slaves
rotting in the hold.

528
00:35:10,722 --> 00:35:11,916
She was a floating graveyard,

529
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:14,288
and when you walked along the streets,
people crossed to the other side.

530
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:17,089
They said you had
the stink of death about you.

531
00:35:17,162 --> 00:35:18,686
Well, you might have washed
it out of your clothes,

532
00:35:18,763 --> 00:35:21,527
but it'll take more than soap and
water to wash it out of your mind.

533
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,191
Your tongue's outrunning
your safety, friend.

534
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:26,465
No court would try you, Captain, because
no one would hold that a Black was a man.

535
00:35:26,538 --> 00:35:28,028
He was an animal,
which you beat and chained,

536
00:35:28,106 --> 00:35:30,199
and all he had to offer up
against you was a prayer.

537
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:31,742
Bilge, Mr. Trumbo. Bilge.

538
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,675
Most men love
the chains they wear.

539
00:35:33,778 --> 00:35:35,541
They need a master the way
they need their mothers.

540
00:35:35,613 --> 00:35:37,012
I've heard such talk
from pulpits.

541
00:35:37,081 --> 00:35:39,140
"The meek shall
inherit the earth. "

542
00:35:39,217 --> 00:35:41,685
No, Mr. Trumbo. The earth belongs
to the men who make the law.

543
00:35:41,753 --> 00:35:44,813
And the law belongs to
the men who can lay it down.

544
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:48,381
You know, Coffin, for all your ways, I've
heard it said that you're a scared man.

545
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,554
Scared that one day a bolt would
break or a chain would give,

546
00:35:51,629 --> 00:35:54,154
and the Blacks would come
swarming up over your quarterdeck.

547
00:35:54,232 --> 00:35:57,258
They said you kept the keys
to the hatches in your pocket.

548
00:35:57,335 --> 00:36:00,327
But have you kept the key
to hold over your mind?

549
00:36:00,405 --> 00:36:02,805
What do you dream about
at night, Captain?

550
00:36:02,874 --> 00:36:06,037
Maybe you still hear the drag
of the chains below decks,

551
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,738
the chanting of the slaves
over their dead.

552
00:36:08,813 --> 00:36:11,611
That's the truth of it,
isn't it, Captain?

553
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:17,410
In Pharaoh City, the truth
has a price on its head.

554
00:36:18,423 --> 00:36:21,483
You don't speak it
unless you're armed,

555
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:25,996
nor intrude into another man's dreams unless
you're prepared to pay for the intrusion.

556
00:36:26,064 --> 00:36:30,000
Save your advice for those who'll
take it at the end of pick handles!

557
00:36:30,068 --> 00:36:34,164
And I had you wrong, Lily. You don't
care about anybody but Lily Bishop.

558
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:36,969
I had you right the first time
I saw you up in Pawnee Flat,

559
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:40,568
when you were lying in the dirt and I
took you for what they said you were.

560
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:43,136
Who said the wages
of sin are death?

561
00:36:43,915 --> 00:36:47,112
Looks like in Pharaoh City
they come pretty high.

562
00:36:50,622 --> 00:36:51,953
Why did you do that?

563
00:36:52,023 --> 00:36:53,752
Better leave, Mr. Trumbo.

564
00:36:54,692 --> 00:36:57,217
Why did you do it?
Why did you do it?

565
00:36:57,662 --> 00:37:00,597
Because I knew you'd
cry over him afterwards.

566
00:37:13,611 --> 00:37:15,272
Looks like she's
petering out, Whitey.

567
00:37:15,346 --> 00:37:17,337
Yeah. Maybe if we staked
a new claim.

568
00:37:17,415 --> 00:37:19,383
All we've got here
is Coffin's leavings.

569
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,749
There must be easier ways of making
a living without dying of pneumonia.

570
00:37:24,656 --> 00:37:26,715
What's that?
Somebody fellin' a tree.

571
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:30,860
Coffin's at it again,
damming up the creek!

572
00:37:44,042 --> 00:37:45,942
You got no right to
dam up this creek.

573
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:48,376
Now, ain't no use
gettin' ornery, boys.

574
00:37:48,446 --> 00:37:50,812
Water is water, and mighty
precious it is, too.

575
00:37:50,882 --> 00:37:53,214
And this here stream, above,
below, and in the middle

576
00:37:53,284 --> 00:37:56,617
happens to be the sole and
peculiar property of Captain Coffin.

577
00:37:56,688 --> 00:37:59,248
Now, it ain't the Captain's
practice to give water away.

578
00:37:59,324 --> 00:38:03,283
But like always, he's willing to share
it with them that is willing to pay.

579
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:05,591
Now, I ask you, what could
be fairer than that?

580
00:38:05,663 --> 00:38:07,392
I thought this was
God's country.

581
00:38:07,465 --> 00:38:08,727
Not no more, it ain't.

582
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,327
What's Coffin aimin' to do, grab
up the whole country of California?

583
00:38:12,403 --> 00:38:14,428
Maybe you're righter
than you know, brother.

584
00:38:14,505 --> 00:38:18,100
You let 'em get by with this, in a month
you'll be crawling to Coffin for a handout.

585
00:38:18,176 --> 00:38:21,270
That's just what I was
thinking. Look out, boys!

586
00:38:37,195 --> 00:38:40,255
Not now, Johnny. Better
let 'em take this trick.

587
00:38:43,201 --> 00:38:45,066
All right, who's next?

588
00:38:45,837 --> 00:38:48,704
Come on, Johnny.
Let's get out of here.

589
00:38:48,773 --> 00:38:50,206
That's right, come on.

590
00:38:53,511 --> 00:38:55,274
$288.

591
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:58,042
Keep it in a safe place, partner.
I'll be around to buy it back.

592
00:38:58,116 --> 00:39:00,107
Well, Clem, I see your
claim's paying off.

593
00:39:00,184 --> 00:39:02,277
Right off the river bottom.

594
00:39:02,387 --> 00:39:03,411
Fourteen ounces.

595
00:39:03,488 --> 00:39:05,513
$224.

596
00:39:10,061 --> 00:39:11,119
Eleven ounces.

597
00:39:11,195 --> 00:39:13,288
$176.

598
00:39:22,707 --> 00:39:24,231
The game is open,
place your bets.

599
00:39:24,308 --> 00:39:25,297
What's the limit?

600
00:39:25,376 --> 00:39:26,400
$40.

601
00:39:26,477 --> 00:39:27,705
Five is soda.

602
00:39:27,779 --> 00:39:29,144
Copper that ten,
will you?

603
00:39:30,748 --> 00:39:33,546
Just a minute. I thought I
told you to stay out of here.

604
00:39:33,618 --> 00:39:36,143
This is business. I don't
want any business from you.

605
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,415
What's the matter,
you scared?

606
00:39:39,457 --> 00:39:41,618
What have you got that
I should be scared of?

607
00:39:41,693 --> 00:39:43,627
Wouldn't be my luck,
would it?

608
00:39:44,962 --> 00:39:47,055
Get up, Mike. I'll take it.

609
00:39:48,366 --> 00:39:50,732
All right, boys.
Place your bets.

610
00:39:50,802 --> 00:39:54,101
This time, Trumbo, there won't
be any burying money.

611
00:40:27,905 --> 00:40:29,395
You win again.

612
00:40:30,608 --> 00:40:32,007
Let it ride.

613
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:41,916
The limit.

614
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:45,150
The limit's raised.

615
00:40:59,036 --> 00:41:00,025
What has she got left?

616
00:41:00,104 --> 00:41:01,093
Four stacks.

617
00:41:01,506 --> 00:41:03,701
All right,
four stacks it is.

618
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:06,008
On the lady.

619
00:41:06,444 --> 00:41:08,674
That all right with you?
Anything you say.

620
00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:16,486
Four, three, ten.

621
00:41:17,722 --> 00:41:20,020
<i>Queen wins.
That's luck for you!</i>

622
00:41:21,692 --> 00:41:23,387
Pay him off, Mike.
The game's closed.

623
00:41:23,461 --> 00:41:25,122
You busted, Lil?
Looks like it.

624
00:41:25,196 --> 00:41:28,927
Just a minute, Lil. I got an
idea, a sporting proposition.

625
00:41:29,433 --> 00:41:31,867
I'll cut you.
This against the whole place.

626
00:41:31,936 --> 00:41:34,302
Everything or nothing, high
card wins. What do you say?

627
00:41:34,372 --> 00:41:37,170
Better not do it, Lil.
He's lucky tonight.

628
00:41:37,575 --> 00:41:40,476
Once you said you weren't
afraid of anything I've got.

629
00:41:40,545 --> 00:41:44,072
Well, I've got this, and it
says you've lost your nerve.

630
00:41:45,483 --> 00:41:47,246
Pack of cards, Mike.

631
00:41:48,686 --> 00:41:50,153
Shuffle them.

632
00:41:53,925 --> 00:41:56,189
Always want to check them,
don't you?

633
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,249
Always.

634
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:03,522
You cut.

635
00:42:06,137 --> 00:42:08,867
Four of diamonds.
You got a chance, Lil.

636
00:42:11,576 --> 00:42:12,838
Go ahead.

637
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:21,277
Two of spades.

638
00:42:21,352 --> 00:42:23,377
Well, looks like I'm
the new proprietor.

639
00:42:24,288 --> 00:42:26,347
Eddie, turn everything over to
him. It's all in order, isn't it?

640
00:42:26,424 --> 00:42:29,951
Yes, Miss Lily, except for tonight.
Some sharper slipped this over on us.

641
00:42:30,027 --> 00:42:32,018
Dirt and lead instead of gold.

642
00:42:32,096 --> 00:42:34,758
Well, that's a fool trick
for anyone to do.

643
00:42:34,832 --> 00:42:36,163
Yes.

644
00:42:36,234 --> 00:42:37,895
A man can get
shot for that.

645
00:42:37,969 --> 00:42:40,267
Not if he gets
away with it, Lil.

646
00:42:40,338 --> 00:42:42,135
Well, drinks on the house,
everybody!

647
00:42:42,206 --> 00:42:43,264
Come on, Clem!

648
00:42:55,286 --> 00:42:58,949
Mr. Trumbo, this is Mr. Gunce.
Says he can paint.

649
00:42:59,023 --> 00:43:01,389
Yeah, what does he paint?
Names on shaving mugs.

650
00:43:01,459 --> 00:43:02,687
In a town full of beards?

651
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,751
Mugs is only a sideline.
I'm the undertaker.

652
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:06,888
Well, could you paint
a sign for out front?

653
00:43:06,964 --> 00:43:08,329
Yep. Plain or fancy?

654
00:43:08,399 --> 00:43:10,196
Just big.
"The Admission Day Saloon. "

655
00:43:10,268 --> 00:43:14,204
Admission Day? Me paint a thing
like that? I don't know, Mr. Trumbo.

656
00:43:14,272 --> 00:43:17,332
California joining the Union's getting
to be fighting words around here.

657
00:43:17,408 --> 00:43:19,035
Some mighty important
people against it.

658
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,271
I'm a business man, I got
my customers to consider.

659
00:43:21,345 --> 00:43:22,972
Why should you worry?
They're all dead, aren't they?

660
00:43:23,047 --> 00:43:25,106
Hmm. Yeah, I never
thought of that.

661
00:43:25,182 --> 00:43:26,581
You know, I never
looked at it that way.

662
00:43:26,651 --> 00:43:29,814
Come on, Gunce, I'll show
you what the boss wants.

663
00:43:29,887 --> 00:43:31,252
Mr. Trumbo.

664
00:43:34,659 --> 00:43:35,683
What's this?

665
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,990
A quit claim deed.
Eddie will show you the books.

666
00:43:38,062 --> 00:43:39,927
You don't have to leave.
You can work here, you know.

667
00:43:39,997 --> 00:43:40,986
Don't do me
any favors.

668
00:43:41,065 --> 00:43:43,033
I'm not.
I need a singer.

669
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,965
Maybe you can get a big piece
of Coffin's money back.

670
00:43:45,036 --> 00:43:47,027
It wasn't Coffin's money.

671
00:43:48,172 --> 00:43:50,231
Then, whose was it?
Mine.

672
00:43:50,308 --> 00:43:54,176
I bought this place from Coffin with
what it took me five years to save.

673
00:43:54,245 --> 00:43:55,678
But that's my
business, not yours.

674
00:43:55,746 --> 00:43:57,737
All right, Lil, if that's
the way you feel.

675
00:43:57,815 --> 00:44:00,045
That's exactly the way I feel.

676
00:44:10,795 --> 00:44:14,390
Mike, wrap up a thousand, chase
after Lil, and see that she gets it.

677
00:44:14,465 --> 00:44:15,693
Burying money.

678
00:44:15,766 --> 00:44:17,791
Won't need no burying money
where she's going.

679
00:44:17,868 --> 00:44:19,768
Why not?
Coffin's place.

680
00:44:24,408 --> 00:44:25,670
Hey, you.

681
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:30,212
Captain's compliments. If you ain't too
busy with these here newly acquired premises,

682
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:33,375
<i>he'd take it kindly if you'd
step down to the hacienda:</i>

683
00:44:33,451 --> 00:44:35,248
He'd like to have a bit
of a word with you.

684
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:36,911
He would, would he?

685
00:44:36,988 --> 00:44:38,979
Want a drink?
Make it rum.

686
00:44:53,571 --> 00:44:55,300
On the house, Pike.

687
00:44:57,842 --> 00:44:59,139
Why would you be
giving me a drink?

688
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:01,474
You got a nice,
kind face.

689
00:45:01,545 --> 00:45:04,013
You had a jug in your hand. Why didn't
you smack me over the head with it?

690
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:05,810
You ever hear of
bullfrogs in a pond?

691
00:45:05,883 --> 00:45:09,842
Well, some sing big, some sing
small. You, I can't even hear you.

692
00:45:10,321 --> 00:45:13,882
Go on, run along to your
Captain. Tell him I'll be there.

693
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:43,309
Come in, Trumbo. Come in.

694
00:45:44,088 --> 00:45:46,249
The Captain's ready
to see you.

695
00:45:46,323 --> 00:45:48,018
Oh, of course,
you two know each other.

696
00:45:48,092 --> 00:45:51,687
Let that bird alone, Pennock.
Let him alone.

697
00:45:51,762 --> 00:45:54,128
Pleasure to see you're prompt,
Mr. Trumbo.

698
00:45:54,198 --> 00:45:57,099
For fun or for fight, I always
like to get there early.

699
00:45:57,168 --> 00:45:58,795
Which do you
expect this time?

700
00:45:59,203 --> 00:46:00,192
You tell me.

701
00:46:01,472 --> 00:46:05,374
When I invited you here, I must admit,
I didn't expect you'd do me the honor.

702
00:46:05,443 --> 00:46:06,910
I appreciate it.

703
00:46:06,977 --> 00:46:09,343
It's just curiosity, Captain.
I'd heard about this place,

704
00:46:09,413 --> 00:46:10,937
but I never would've
believed it.

705
00:46:11,015 --> 00:46:13,210
I hear you took over
the Golden Lily last night.

706
00:46:13,284 --> 00:46:16,481
I like a man who takes what he
wants, doesn't ask too many questions.

707
00:46:16,554 --> 00:46:17,953
I like to see
him get ahead.

708
00:46:18,022 --> 00:46:19,580
Yeah, but not too
far ahead, huh?

709
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:24,719
I have a good piece of
this country in my hands.

710
00:46:24,795 --> 00:46:27,992
You'd be very foolish
to think that I'd let it go.

711
00:46:28,899 --> 00:46:29,991
What's on your
mind, Coffin?

712
00:46:30,067 --> 00:46:31,261
I'll put it two
ways, friend.

713
00:46:31,335 --> 00:46:33,895
I'll buy the Golden Lily at a
fair price, and you can leave town.

714
00:46:33,971 --> 00:46:36,906
Or you can stay here and go along
with me. Know what that means?

715
00:46:36,974 --> 00:46:38,965
I'm doing all right alone.
Saloon keeper?

716
00:46:39,043 --> 00:46:41,375
Any fool can line his pockets
with silver dollars.

717
00:46:41,445 --> 00:46:43,936
Lift your eyes above
your whiskey bottles.

718
00:46:58,796 --> 00:47:01,026
I could possess this country,

719
00:47:01,098 --> 00:47:03,259
this California and all
the power that goes with it,

720
00:47:03,334 --> 00:47:05,734
if I had a handful
of men like you.

721
00:47:10,074 --> 00:47:12,304
No deal. You may not
know it, Mr. Trumbo,

722
00:47:12,376 --> 00:47:15,072
but you've just made
a very dangerous decision.

723
00:47:15,146 --> 00:47:19,412
You may not know it, Captain, but from this
minute on, I'm going to start crowding you.

724
00:47:19,483 --> 00:47:24,147
I'm going to keep on crowding you till
I've pushed you right into the Pacific.

725
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:29,885
Keep on playing, Lily.
Keep on playing.

726
00:47:41,539 --> 00:47:44,269
Blast you, Pennock,
leave that bird alone!

727
00:47:46,577 --> 00:47:47,805
What was that?

728
00:47:47,878 --> 00:47:49,175
The clock, Captain.

729
00:47:51,348 --> 00:47:52,872
Just the clock.

730
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:03,449
I never found another island like
that in all the southern seas.

731
00:48:03,527 --> 00:48:06,052
Such tranquility,
such a paradise.

732
00:48:07,565 --> 00:48:10,659
Yes, a man could well
forget himself there.

733
00:48:10,768 --> 00:48:12,258
Why didn't you stay?

734
00:48:12,336 --> 00:48:14,270
That horizon's
too narrow for me.

735
00:48:14,338 --> 00:48:15,362
Elvira!

736
00:48:18,909 --> 00:48:23,346
No, the only reason I'd ever go there
again would be to take you with me.

737
00:48:30,654 --> 00:48:34,988
Did you hear what I said, Lily?
I'd like to take you there someday.

738
00:48:36,327 --> 00:48:38,488
I've been everywhere
else, why not?

739
00:48:38,562 --> 00:48:39,551
No, no.

740
00:48:40,164 --> 00:48:42,462
I mean as my wife.

741
00:48:45,603 --> 00:48:47,366
You really mean
that, don't you?

742
00:48:47,438 --> 00:48:48,837
Ever since I first saw you.

743
00:48:49,773 --> 00:48:52,003
Does that seem strange to you?

744
00:48:56,247 --> 00:48:58,977
All my life, I've wanted
to be just that.

745
00:48:59,883 --> 00:49:01,145
A wife.

746
00:49:02,253 --> 00:49:03,743
Does that seem
strange to you?

747
00:49:03,821 --> 00:49:07,552
No. I have no illusions
that you love me.

748
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:09,718
I believe we can be
happy together.

749
00:49:09,793 --> 00:49:10,987
Let's put the past behind us.

750
00:49:11,061 --> 00:49:13,859
I know what they say about me,
slaver, all the rest of it.

751
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:17,731
Everything I did, I did because
I had to. Nobody ever helped me.

752
00:49:17,801 --> 00:49:19,996
Son of a drunken sail-rigger.

753
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:24,336
I took more beatings before I was
12 than any felon does in a lifetime.

754
00:49:24,408 --> 00:49:28,538
Ran away, slept under walls
like a rat, till one day

755
00:49:29,747 --> 00:49:32,841
I saw a Captain step from
his ship to the shore.

756
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:35,684
Bright buttons
gleaming in the sun.

757
00:49:36,253 --> 00:49:39,416
Giving orders like a giant,
like a king.

758
00:49:41,025 --> 00:49:43,459
And I became
the master of a ship.

759
00:49:43,527 --> 00:49:47,258
Now I'm master of a town,
dirty, stinking place that it is.

760
00:49:47,331 --> 00:49:50,823
And tomorrow I'll be master of a
country, yes, even all California.

761
00:49:50,901 --> 00:49:53,028
When that happens,
I want you...

762
00:49:53,103 --> 00:49:55,537
Well, you're not even
listening to what I'm saying.

763
00:49:55,606 --> 00:49:58,803
You've other thoughts
in your eyes. You...

764
00:49:58,876 --> 00:50:01,242
You're thinking of
somebody else.

765
00:50:02,313 --> 00:50:03,803
Yes, I am.
Who?

766
00:50:05,082 --> 00:50:06,549
A little boy.

767
00:50:07,484 --> 00:50:10,282
I was trying to picture
you like you said.

768
00:50:11,655 --> 00:50:13,953
I'm beginning to
understand you.

769
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:16,253
Lily...

770
00:50:26,603 --> 00:50:29,197
Goodnight Mike.
Goodnight, Mr. Trumbo.

771
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:45,812
All right, Trumbo, don't
bother to put those away.

772
00:50:45,889 --> 00:50:49,347
This is your last night in
Pharaoh City. Come over here.

773
00:50:49,927 --> 00:50:52,259
You heard what
the Captain said.

774
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,258
Here's a quit claim deed
for the Golden Lily.

775
00:51:00,337 --> 00:51:02,464
There's a pen. Sign it.

776
00:51:16,653 --> 00:51:18,314
Stop it, get away.

777
00:51:19,957 --> 00:51:21,948
It's regrettable that a man
has to be taught these lessons,

778
00:51:22,025 --> 00:51:24,220
but sometimes it's necessary.

779
00:51:29,299 --> 00:51:31,665
He's tied good
and fast, Captain.

780
00:52:16,246 --> 00:52:20,342
Hammerin', hammerin'. Sure a lot
of buildin' going on around here.

781
00:52:20,417 --> 00:52:24,217
Church, new houses, a school. I tell
you, Whitey, it's getting so civilized

782
00:52:24,288 --> 00:52:26,188
they'll soon tell you
where to spit.

783
00:52:26,256 --> 00:52:30,317
Yes, sir, Pokey, never thought I'd see
a church being put up in Pharaoh City.

784
00:52:30,394 --> 00:52:32,191
Here comes the stage.

785
00:52:37,267 --> 00:52:40,361
Warren, you see that everything gets
off all right. I'll find out where we go.

786
00:52:40,437 --> 00:52:41,563
Howdy, Joe.
Howdy.

787
00:52:41,638 --> 00:52:44,664
<i>You there, we're looking for
Captain Coffin's hacienda:</i>

788
00:52:44,741 --> 00:52:47,209
Mister, you're the seventeenth
party to ask me that today.

789
00:52:47,277 --> 00:52:49,211
What's going on there,
a barbecue or something?

790
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,304
Come, come, man, pull
yourself together. Where is it?

791
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:54,441
Well, if you point that there
belly of yours south-by-southeast

792
00:52:54,518 --> 00:52:57,214
and keeps a-followin' it and
don't fall down no gopher holes,

793
00:52:57,287 --> 00:53:01,690
I reckon you'll get there. Mighty
fancy looking man, ain't he, Whitey?

794
00:53:37,227 --> 00:53:39,627
Always thought there was nothing
but grizzlies and Indians out here,

795
00:53:39,696 --> 00:53:43,393
but I swear I've never seen so many
beautiful women. Where do they all come from?

796
00:53:43,467 --> 00:53:46,664
This is a big country, Creel. It's
taken some of them days to get here.

797
00:53:46,737 --> 00:53:48,364
Captain, I haven't seen
Tomlin yet.

798
00:53:48,438 --> 00:53:51,134
I'm informed that Mr. Tomlin
met with an unfortunate accident

799
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:53,073
on his way from Santa Barbara. Bandits?

800
00:53:53,143 --> 00:53:56,340
No Senator, he talked
too loud and too long.

801
00:53:56,513 --> 00:53:57,502
Excuse me.

802
00:54:03,987 --> 00:54:05,852
<i>Don Luis.
Seor Coffin.</i>

803
00:54:07,124 --> 00:54:09,786
I'd like a word with you, at
your convenience, of course.

804
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,384
At the conclusion
of this dance, sir.

805
00:54:11,461 --> 00:54:12,450
Thank you.

806
00:54:25,509 --> 00:54:27,841
Music won't help
you now, me boy.

807
00:54:35,586 --> 00:54:39,249
Johnny. Johnny, come
in! It's good to see you.

808
00:54:39,323 --> 00:54:42,156
How are you, Grandpa? Bring
him some coffee. Sit down.

809
00:54:42,225 --> 00:54:43,487
We were wondering
what happened to you.

810
00:54:43,594 --> 00:54:46,358
It wasn't like you to sell out
and run off without tellin' nobody.

811
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:48,022
I didn't sell out,
I was run out.

812
00:54:48,131 --> 00:54:51,123
Captain Coffin. Did a pretty
good job, too. Almost perfect.

813
00:54:51,201 --> 00:54:52,532
You've been gone
six weeks now.

814
00:54:52,603 --> 00:54:54,764
Well, I wasn't in the best
of health when I left here.

815
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:57,432
If it hadn't been for a couple
of Mexicans, I'd have cashed in.

816
00:54:57,507 --> 00:54:58,906
They packed me 100 miles
to a mission,

817
00:54:58,976 --> 00:55:00,773
<i>hoping the padres
could cheat the devil.</i>

818
00:55:00,844 --> 00:55:02,368
Well, they did.

819
00:55:02,646 --> 00:55:04,637
Whitey, where's your gun?

820
00:55:06,717 --> 00:55:08,378
What do you
want it for?

821
00:55:08,518 --> 00:55:09,678
Don't do it,
Johnny.

822
00:55:09,753 --> 00:55:11,311
It'll do you no good
to kill Coffin.

823
00:55:11,388 --> 00:55:13,117
Men like Coffin are like
weeds in the fields,

824
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:16,284
you have to dig 'em up by the
roots. Can't do that with a gun.

825
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,055
There'll be law and order
around here soon.

826
00:55:18,128 --> 00:55:20,358
There's talk already of
a convention in Monterey

827
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:22,830
to make California another
state in the Union.

828
00:55:22,899 --> 00:55:25,993
When that happens, the law will
take care of men like Coffin.

829
00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:27,593
Sorry, Grandpa.

830
00:55:28,805 --> 00:55:30,705
I can't wait that long.

831
00:55:33,677 --> 00:55:35,611
This proclamation, gentlemen,
I'm sure you've all seen.

832
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,510
It's been posted
all over California.

833
00:55:37,581 --> 00:55:40,141
General Riley, Washington's
latest gift to California,

834
00:55:40,217 --> 00:55:44,119
has designated September 1st for a convention
to be held at Colton Hall, Monterey.

835
00:55:44,187 --> 00:55:46,451
In the hands of the delegates of
this convention will rest the decision

836
00:55:46,523 --> 00:55:49,048
as to whether or not
California is to become a state.

837
00:55:49,126 --> 00:55:52,220
As you all know, I intend to
be a delegate myself.

838
00:55:52,295 --> 00:55:54,456
Even so, the convention
may go against us,

839
00:55:54,531 --> 00:55:58,023
and it is to consider this possibility
that we're meeting here tonight.

840
00:55:58,101 --> 00:55:59,534
<i>What is Seor Coffin
proposing?</i>

841
00:55:59,603 --> 00:56:01,093
Immediate preparation
for the armed seizure

842
00:56:01,171 --> 00:56:02,832
of the centers of power
in California.

843
00:56:02,906 --> 00:56:05,272
Isn't that rushing things
a little too fast, Captain?

844
00:56:05,342 --> 00:56:07,936
Too fast, Mr. Barrett? Nothing
can be further from the fact.

845
00:56:08,011 --> 00:56:10,377
The whole country is rushing
toward armed conflict.

846
00:56:10,447 --> 00:56:14,247
And when that time comes, my friends,
a strong and independent California

847
00:56:14,317 --> 00:56:17,411
may effect decisively
the outcome of that conflict.

848
00:56:17,487 --> 00:56:19,182
Sir, I, too, would like
California to be

849
00:56:19,256 --> 00:56:21,588
a great and glorious
independent country.

850
00:56:21,658 --> 00:56:24,627
And yet, if the people
should be against it, I...

851
00:56:24,695 --> 00:56:26,788
I would be a fool
to fight them.

852
00:56:26,863 --> 00:56:30,731
Much blood has already been spilled
on this beautiful ground. Too much.

853
00:56:30,801 --> 00:56:35,738
The Senator, it seems, is asking a great
deal of us. What can we expect from him?

854
00:56:35,806 --> 00:56:39,173
Yes, if we are going to take the country
by force, what do we do about weapons?

855
00:56:39,242 --> 00:56:40,869
Powder and shot
don't grow on trees.

856
00:56:41,011 --> 00:56:42,911
No, Mr. Willoughby,
they do not.

857
00:56:42,979 --> 00:56:45,413
Before we adjourn tonight, I think
I can promise you ample evidence

858
00:56:45,482 --> 00:56:47,746
of Senator Creel's good faith.

859
00:58:24,714 --> 00:58:25,738
Who are you?

860
00:58:25,816 --> 00:58:28,512
Well, I suppose
you could call me a guest.

861
00:58:28,585 --> 00:58:29,950
Please do not
tell the Captain.

862
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:31,009
Tell him what?

863
00:58:31,121 --> 00:58:34,215
I am not supposed to be here.
He keeps the chapel locked.

864
00:58:34,324 --> 00:58:35,348
Why?

865
00:58:35,425 --> 00:58:37,893
That must be him now!

866
00:58:39,996 --> 00:58:41,861
Follow me, gentlemen.

867
00:58:43,233 --> 00:58:46,396
Perhaps you'll find
these precincts overly pious,

868
00:58:46,469 --> 00:58:48,960
but I assure you,
they're practical.

869
00:58:54,244 --> 00:58:55,506
Well, there you are,
gentlemen.

870
00:58:55,579 --> 00:58:57,012
Guns and ammunition galore.

871
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,308
Fancy place
for an armory, Coffin.

872
00:58:58,381 --> 00:59:00,611
Even Mr. Willoughby could
hardly wish for more.

873
00:59:00,684 --> 00:59:02,879
Good heavens, no.
Enough to equip a regiment.

874
00:59:02,953 --> 00:59:05,148
And we ran 'em in, every one
of them, didn't we, Pennock?

875
00:59:05,222 --> 00:59:06,314
Right under
Colonel Stuart's nose.

876
00:59:06,389 --> 00:59:08,016
Stuart?
Is he back in California?

877
00:59:08,091 --> 00:59:09,490
He's encamped
not far from here.

878
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:10,890
You don't suppose
he's got wind of this?

879
00:59:10,961 --> 00:59:13,589
If I know Stuart, he's too busy
with his own political career.

880
00:59:13,663 --> 00:59:15,528
These are really very good
guns. Indeed, they are.

881
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,863
Seems to me, Coffin, you've
got all your eggs in one basket.

882
00:59:17,934 --> 00:59:20,494
Why not pass them around, get them
out of here? We will, in due time.

883
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:24,563
Come on, gentlemen. I think we've had
enough proof of Senator Creel's good faith.

884
00:59:51,067 --> 00:59:52,500
Why does he have
these guns here?

885
00:59:52,569 --> 00:59:55,504
<i>I do not know, seor,
but no good can come of it.</i>

886
00:59:58,975 --> 01:00:01,034
What do you think
he is thinking

887
01:00:01,111 --> 01:00:04,308
that his house should be made
into a hiding place for rifles?

888
01:00:04,381 --> 01:00:07,407
I take it you don't like
Coffin, either. Why?

889
01:00:07,517 --> 01:00:10,714
Is it right that a woman should
have to steal a key to pray?

890
01:00:10,787 --> 01:00:12,049
No, it isn't right.

891
01:00:12,122 --> 01:00:14,386
And maybe that's all
going to be changed.

892
01:00:16,226 --> 01:00:17,887
<i>Be careful, seor:</i>

893
01:00:18,595 --> 01:00:20,961
You are only one man
against many.

894
01:00:21,031 --> 01:00:23,329
You just forget
you ever saw me.

895
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:34,838
<i>Look away, look away</i>

896
01:00:35,712 --> 01:00:41,048
<i>Said I to my heart, said I</i>

897
01:00:41,651 --> 01:00:45,610
<i>Never trust yourself
with a summer sky</i>

898
01:00:45,822 --> 01:00:51,124
<i>A rambling arm,
a roving eye</i>

899
01:00:51,194 --> 01:00:57,155
<i>Every summer kiss
brings an autumn sigh</i>

900
01:00:58,134 --> 01:01:04,232
<i>Said I to my heart, said I</i>

901
01:01:04,908 --> 01:01:10,540
<i>Look away, there's trouble</i>

902
01:01:10,613 --> 01:01:15,107
<i>A stranger has come to town</i>

903
01:01:15,485 --> 01:01:20,946
<i>Look away, big trouble</i>

904
01:01:21,524 --> 01:01:24,652
<i>His eyes are too soft</i>

905
01:01:24,728 --> 01:01:30,530
<i>and brown, brown, brown</i>

906
01:01:31,768 --> 01:01:36,330
<i>Oh, does he think to win you
with song and sigh?</i>

907
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:41,667
<i>With rambling arm,
and roving eye?</i>

908
01:01:41,778 --> 01:01:44,144
<i>Does he think you'll smile</i>

909
01:01:44,214 --> 01:01:49,880
<i>and away you'll fly?</i>

910
01:01:50,286 --> 01:01:54,279
<i>Said I to my heart,</i>

911
01:01:54,524 --> 01:01:58,824
<i>Said I</i>

912
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:05,161
<i>Goodbye, said my heart</i>

913
01:02:06,603 --> 01:02:11,597
<i>Goodbye</i>

914
01:03:05,428 --> 01:03:07,396
What are you doing here?

915
01:03:07,697 --> 01:03:10,689
<i>Thought I'd like to see
one of Coffin's fiestas:</i>

916
01:03:10,767 --> 01:03:13,327
You know this isn't
a safe place for you.

917
01:03:13,403 --> 01:03:14,870
Since when have you cared?

918
01:03:15,572 --> 01:03:16,596
I don't.

919
01:03:16,673 --> 01:03:17,935
Then why warn me?

920
01:03:18,007 --> 01:03:20,498
I haven't changed.
Why should you?

921
01:03:21,444 --> 01:03:24,174
Perhaps it's because
I'm not afraid anymore.

922
01:03:24,247 --> 01:03:26,112
Of you, of anything.

923
01:03:26,249 --> 01:03:28,308
Perhaps it's because
for the first time in my life

924
01:03:28,384 --> 01:03:30,579
I've got something
I've always wanted.

925
01:03:30,653 --> 01:03:32,143
What would that be?

926
01:03:32,922 --> 01:03:35,117
I'm going to marry
Pharaoh Coffin.

927
01:03:37,393 --> 01:03:38,860
You don't love him.

928
01:03:39,462 --> 01:03:40,451
He knows it.

929
01:03:43,433 --> 01:03:45,560
You wouldn't understand,
would you?

930
01:03:46,002 --> 01:03:48,994
That a woman can sometimes
manage without love.

931
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:52,735
Providing the price
is all right.

932
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:55,840
A month ago I would have
hated you for that.

933
01:03:56,546 --> 01:03:58,480
Now it doesn't matter.

934
01:03:58,648 --> 01:04:01,412
I could even tell you
I could have liked you.

935
01:04:01,751 --> 01:04:03,241
The way you were
with the kids on the trail,

936
01:04:03,319 --> 01:04:05,344
the way you are
with Fabian.

937
01:04:05,655 --> 01:04:07,145
You talk hard,

938
01:04:07,824 --> 01:04:10,486
but underneath you're human
like everybody else.

939
01:04:12,328 --> 01:04:16,492
Why didn't you ever show that side to
me instead of always trying to hurt me?

940
01:04:16,933 --> 01:04:18,730
Why do you tell me now?

941
01:04:19,502 --> 01:04:20,935
Because it's too late.

942
01:04:22,505 --> 01:04:23,995
Too late, Trumbo.

943
01:04:24,507 --> 01:04:26,407
Lily...
Please go.

944
01:04:26,476 --> 01:04:28,706
You were right about me
trying to hurt you.

945
01:04:28,778 --> 01:04:31,770
I wanted to, I guess.
Don't ask my why.

946
01:04:31,848 --> 01:04:33,611
Maybe I wanted to even up
with a lot of other women.

947
01:04:33,683 --> 01:04:35,378
Please go before you're seen.

948
01:04:35,451 --> 01:04:38,386
And I'm gonna hurt you again,
worse than ever.

949
01:04:39,022 --> 01:04:41,013
And I'm gonna be sorry for it.

950
01:04:41,457 --> 01:04:42,890
You can't hurt me.

951
01:04:43,293 --> 01:04:45,887
That's one thing
I've promised myself.

952
01:04:46,429 --> 01:04:48,624
You can't hurt me ever again.

953
01:04:49,465 --> 01:04:52,093
I came here tonight
to kill Pharaoh Coffin,

954
01:04:53,069 --> 01:04:55,629
but I'm not going to,
not tonight.

955
01:04:56,406 --> 01:04:57,771
I found out enough
about your Captain

956
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,365
to make me want to
find out a little more.

957
01:05:01,177 --> 01:05:04,078
But I'll come back, Lil,
and when I do,

958
01:05:04,147 --> 01:05:05,239
nothing's gonna save him.

959
01:05:05,315 --> 01:05:06,612
No, you mustn't.

960
01:05:09,018 --> 01:05:11,452
Even if I loved you,
you couldn't stop me now.

961
01:05:12,922 --> 01:05:15,823
Afterwards, you can
go on hating me again.

962
01:06:06,576 --> 01:06:08,976
Lily, it's you.
I'm glad you came.

963
01:06:09,379 --> 01:06:11,506
My guests kept me so busy.

964
01:06:12,081 --> 01:06:14,413
But I missed you.

965
01:06:16,452 --> 01:06:18,784
I need you.

966
01:06:19,789 --> 01:06:22,485
You must never leave me
for so long again.

967
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,520
I won't leave you, Pharaoh.

968
01:06:26,729 --> 01:06:28,993
What's the matter?
You seem unhappy.

969
01:06:31,534 --> 01:06:33,832
No, I'm not.

970
01:06:33,903 --> 01:06:37,100
But just now, when you were
dancing, your eyes were smiling.

971
01:06:37,674 --> 01:06:39,005
But now...

972
01:06:41,811 --> 01:06:43,574
They will be again.

973
01:06:44,647 --> 01:06:47,810
In all my life, I never want
to cause you a moment's sadness.

974
01:06:48,451 --> 01:06:50,112
If only I could...

975
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,097
What was that?

976
01:07:06,369 --> 01:07:08,667
Only the wind stirring
the branches, Pharaoh.

977
01:07:09,806 --> 01:07:11,000
Just the wind.

978
01:07:21,351 --> 01:07:23,319
You know, for a moment
it sounded

979
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:26,313
just like naked feet

980
01:07:27,824 --> 01:07:30,156
shuffling across the deck.

981
01:07:46,676 --> 01:07:48,610
Well, who are you?
What do you want?

982
01:07:48,878 --> 01:07:50,903
Could I speak to you
alone, sir? No, you may not.

983
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,743
Speak your piece
and get out.

984
01:07:53,316 --> 01:07:55,113
Oh, it's you.

985
01:07:55,651 --> 01:07:57,949
Captain Odlum, Sergeant,
close the door.

986
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,484
All right, Trumbo.

987
01:08:05,561 --> 01:08:07,552
I don't know what
brought you here,

988
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:09,063
but you know how the army
treats desertion.

989
01:08:09,132 --> 01:08:10,599
I know, sir.

990
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:12,156
Consider yourself
under close arrest.

991
01:08:12,235 --> 01:08:13,497
I didn't wake you up
in the middle of the night

992
01:08:13,569 --> 01:08:15,161
to put myself
in the guardhouse.

993
01:08:15,238 --> 01:08:16,330
What else do you expect?

994
01:08:16,406 --> 01:08:17,964
I'd like to make a deal.

995
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,598
A deal? You've got
nothing to trade.

996
01:08:19,742 --> 01:08:21,801
Ever hear of
Captain Pharaoh Coffin?

997
01:08:21,878 --> 01:08:23,368
The man who is running for
the Monterey convention?

998
01:08:23,446 --> 01:08:25,107
That's not all
he's running for.

999
01:08:25,181 --> 01:08:28,617
What if I said he's setting himself up
for taking over the whole of California?

1000
01:08:28,684 --> 01:08:30,242
I'd say either he was crazy
or you were.

1001
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:33,254
Not if you saw the rifles he's been
running in, enough to start a small war.

1002
01:08:33,322 --> 01:08:34,789
Can't hang a man for having
a few rifles.

1003
01:08:34,857 --> 01:08:36,222
Is that all the evidence
you got?

1004
01:08:36,292 --> 01:08:38,624
That, and some rumors
and a hunch.

1005
01:08:38,694 --> 01:08:40,161
If I wrote down every rumor
a fella gets around here,

1006
01:08:40,229 --> 01:08:41,787
I'd need half
the United States Army.

1007
01:08:41,864 --> 01:08:44,094
You make a deal with me and you
won't need the United States Army.

1008
01:08:44,167 --> 01:08:48,160
Confound it, Trumbo! The United States
Army doesn't make deals with deserters.

1009
01:08:48,237 --> 01:08:49,761
You come in here with
some cock-and-bull story...

1010
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:50,828
I beg your pardon, sir,

1011
01:08:50,907 --> 01:08:52,374
it's not
a cock-and-bull story.

1012
01:08:52,442 --> 01:08:53,704
No?

1013
01:08:53,776 --> 01:08:55,243
You help me wipe out
my court martial,

1014
01:08:55,311 --> 01:08:57,336
and I'll take Coffin
off your hands.

1015
01:08:57,613 --> 01:08:59,240
How? Kill him?

1016
01:08:59,315 --> 01:09:00,612
Something like that.

1017
01:09:01,684 --> 01:09:04,278
That way of settling disputes
is over, Trumbo.

1018
01:09:04,353 --> 01:09:07,880
This is the day of potbellies, frock
coats, politicians, conventions.

1019
01:09:08,891 --> 01:09:11,553
If you want to kill this man,
kill him politically.

1020
01:09:11,661 --> 01:09:14,391
Run somebody against him and
break his back at the polls.

1021
01:09:15,064 --> 01:09:17,658
Now, do you know anybody
that's really respected?

1022
01:09:17,867 --> 01:09:19,300
Integrity? Honesty?

1023
01:09:19,368 --> 01:09:21,268
Yes, I know somebody
like that.

1024
01:09:21,537 --> 01:09:23,198
Michael Fabian, a farmer.

1025
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:26,206
But what if it doesn't break
Coffin's back?

1026
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:29,337
Tell you what I'll do, Trumbo.

1027
01:09:30,179 --> 01:09:32,579
I'll take responsibility
for you myself.

1028
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:35,141
I'll give you your freedom
for 90 days.

1029
01:09:35,218 --> 01:09:36,947
That's till after
the Monterey convention.

1030
01:09:37,286 --> 01:09:39,117
Then you report back here
and you face court martial.

1031
01:09:39,188 --> 01:09:42,487
If you don't, you won't get
two years, you'll get 20.

1032
01:09:42,959 --> 01:09:43,948
Yes, sir.

1033
01:09:44,494 --> 01:09:47,691
Uh, Trumbo, one thing
always interested me.

1034
01:09:47,997 --> 01:09:50,090
That woman at
Fort Marcy,

1035
01:09:50,566 --> 01:09:52,500
just who was chasing who?

1036
01:09:52,869 --> 01:09:54,336
It's your guess, sir.

1037
01:09:54,437 --> 01:09:56,064
Hardly worth
deserting for.

1038
01:09:56,506 --> 01:09:58,701
It's either that
or shoot the husband.

1039
01:09:58,841 --> 01:10:00,172
Anything else, sir?

1040
01:10:00,676 --> 01:10:01,973
You have 90 days.

1041
01:10:02,912 --> 01:10:04,140
Thank you, sir.

1042
01:10:09,452 --> 01:10:10,749
Do you think
he's gonna do it?

1043
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:12,082
He's got to.

1044
01:10:15,358 --> 01:10:17,417
Well, Michael,
what's the word?

1045
01:10:18,961 --> 01:10:20,929
By the way,
whose idea was this?

1046
01:10:21,297 --> 01:10:23,527
Mine.
Oh, it was, huh?

1047
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:26,363
If we let Coffin get to Monterey without
putting up a man to run against him,

1048
01:10:26,435 --> 01:10:28,335
we deserve everything
he hands us.

1049
01:10:28,671 --> 01:10:29,797
You've been yelling
for a school,

1050
01:10:29,872 --> 01:10:31,669
you even got 'em
building a courthouse.

1051
01:10:31,741 --> 01:10:33,936
What are you going to do,
let Coffin sit in it?

1052
01:10:34,277 --> 01:10:35,642
I don't know, boys.

1053
01:10:35,711 --> 01:10:37,372
I'm not one for being
a politician.

1054
01:10:37,446 --> 01:10:40,244
I'm just an ordinary man
with dirt on me hands.

1055
01:10:40,316 --> 01:10:43,843
Well, maybe it's about time some
ordinary folks took a hold around here.

1056
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,548
And what about me vines?
I've got things growing here.

1057
01:10:46,622 --> 01:10:49,056
Who'll take care of them? They
need care. Who will give it to them?

1058
01:10:49,225 --> 01:10:51,193
Don't worry about
your grapes, Michael.

1059
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:52,420
They'll be worked.

1060
01:10:52,695 --> 01:10:55,220
Well, boys, you've run me
clean out of argument.

1061
01:10:55,431 --> 01:10:57,695
I can see meself
making speeches.

1062
01:10:57,767 --> 01:11:00,292
But I tell you, I'm not going
round kissing any babies.

1063
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:02,801
Don't worry about
kissing no babies.

1064
01:11:02,872 --> 01:11:05,102
You just stand for office.
We'll see that you get elected.

1065
01:12:15,845 --> 01:12:16,903
Well?

1066
01:12:16,979 --> 01:12:18,742
You lost, Captain. How bad?

1067
01:12:18,814 --> 01:12:20,406
You're scuppered,
sunk.

1068
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:22,845
Thanks to your friend,
Trumbo.

1069
01:12:23,019 --> 01:12:25,078
So Fabian goes
to Monterey.

1070
01:12:25,154 --> 01:12:26,985
That's bad for you,
isn't it, Pharaoh?

1071
01:12:27,056 --> 01:12:28,489
Troublesome, perhaps.

1072
01:12:28,557 --> 01:12:30,650
Even more so for Mr. Fabian.

1073
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:33,260
Why don't you continue
playing, Lily?

1074
01:12:46,542 --> 01:12:48,134
<i>P- E-N-sylvania</i>

1075
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:52,943
<i>Roll on and roll on
and roll and go:</i>

1076
01:12:53,082 --> 01:12:56,108
Hurray!
Fabian for Monterey!

1077
01:12:56,185 --> 01:12:57,345
We better let him
get some sleep

1078
01:12:57,420 --> 01:12:58,478
or he'll never get
to Monterey.

1079
01:12:58,554 --> 01:13:00,112
Good night, fellas.
Thanks for everything.

1080
01:13:00,189 --> 01:13:01,281
Congratulations again!

1081
01:13:01,357 --> 01:13:03,120
Good night! So long!

1082
01:13:03,192 --> 01:13:04,659
Get some sleep.

1083
01:13:09,865 --> 01:13:11,025
Michael.

1084
01:13:11,701 --> 01:13:12,793
Lily, what are you doing here?

1085
01:13:12,868 --> 01:13:15,166
I'm asking you not to
go to Monterey. Why not?

1086
01:13:15,237 --> 01:13:16,363
I'm afraid for you.

1087
01:13:16,439 --> 01:13:18,270
Don't you see? This whole
thing is Trumbo's idea.

1088
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:20,103
He's using you
to pay off a grudge.

1089
01:13:20,176 --> 01:13:21,165
What are you talking about?

1090
01:13:21,243 --> 01:13:22,574
You don't know how to fight
the way they fight.

1091
01:13:22,645 --> 01:13:24,943
There's no telling what might
happen when the cards are down.

1092
01:13:25,014 --> 01:13:26,982
The cards are down.
I know.

1093
01:13:27,049 --> 01:13:28,949
That's why I'm asking you
not to go.

1094
01:13:29,018 --> 01:13:31,885
A man can't keep out of danger
by hiding under the bed.

1095
01:13:31,954 --> 01:13:33,546
Sit down, child.

1096
01:13:34,323 --> 01:13:36,052
This is a big new country,

1097
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:38,787
and the people came here
to get gold, most of them.

1098
01:13:38,861 --> 01:13:41,830
But now they've started
farming and raising families,

1099
01:13:42,131 --> 01:13:44,793
and you can no more keep them
from making California a state

1100
01:13:44,867 --> 01:13:46,858
than you can keep
the sun from shining.

1101
01:13:46,936 --> 01:13:48,164
Because they're ordinary folk,

1102
01:13:48,237 --> 01:13:51,866
and ordinary folk are kind of
stubborn about important questions.

1103
01:13:51,941 --> 01:13:53,636
Don't be afraid for me.

1104
01:13:53,843 --> 01:13:56,004
I wish you wouldn't
go, Michael.

1105
01:13:56,078 --> 01:13:59,605
I've been elected to go to
Monterey, and to Monterey I'll go.

1106
01:14:06,856 --> 01:14:08,824
Well, Michael, you sure got
Coffin a-sweating.

1107
01:14:08,891 --> 01:14:10,381
We're not out
of the woods yet.

1108
01:14:10,459 --> 01:14:11,448
We'll see tomorrow.

1109
01:14:11,527 --> 01:14:14,621
Yeah, your speech will have
to be a powerful heap of words.

1110
01:14:16,432 --> 01:14:17,956
Here you are.
Thanks, Abe.

1111
01:14:20,002 --> 01:14:21,230
Johnny.

1112
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:25,805
See you later, Creel.

1113
01:14:25,875 --> 01:14:27,001
Sorry to be so late.

1114
01:14:27,076 --> 01:14:28,338
Things going badly,
Pharaoh?

1115
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:29,434
I'll know better
after tomorrow.

1116
01:14:29,512 --> 01:14:31,571
Your friend, Fabian,
is going to speak.

1117
01:14:31,647 --> 01:14:32,875
I'd like to be there.

1118
01:14:32,948 --> 01:14:36,042
You know, Lily, sometimes I
wonder whose side you're really on.

1119
01:14:38,687 --> 01:14:40,848
What have you got
in the box?

1120
01:14:41,524 --> 01:14:43,151
My wedding dress.

1121
01:15:06,382 --> 01:15:07,576
Whiskey.

1122
01:15:15,925 --> 01:15:17,392
<i>You're Seor Trumbo.</i>

1123
01:15:17,693 --> 01:15:18,955
Yeah. Who are you?

1124
01:15:19,061 --> 01:15:20,153
It is of no consequence.

1125
01:15:20,229 --> 01:15:21,958
<i>You're a friend of
Seor Fabian's, are you not?</i>

1126
01:15:22,031 --> 01:15:23,521
What about it?

1127
01:15:24,133 --> 01:15:25,293
<i>Seor:::</i>

1128
01:15:26,101 --> 01:15:27,625
As you may have observed,
I'm a little drunk.

1129
01:15:27,703 --> 01:15:29,933
It's not a habit,
I assure you.

1130
01:15:30,005 --> 01:15:32,132
Sometimes a man has thoughts.

1131
01:15:32,708 --> 01:15:35,108
<i>I'm Don Luis
Rivera y Hernandez.</i>

1132
01:15:35,177 --> 01:15:37,475
In California,
that is an honorable name.

1133
01:15:37,613 --> 01:15:39,911
With honor,
a man should be more careful.

1134
01:15:39,982 --> 01:15:40,971
Do you agree?

1135
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:42,039
I wouldn't know.

1136
01:15:42,751 --> 01:15:44,844
Your friend Fabian
speaks tomorrow.

1137
01:15:45,154 --> 01:15:46,143
You got any objections?

1138
01:15:46,455 --> 01:15:47,444
Don't let him.

1139
01:15:48,123 --> 01:15:49,613
If you have any influence
with your friend,

1140
01:15:49,692 --> 01:15:52,991
<i>take him away from Monterey
at once, seor: At once!</i>

1141
01:15:53,062 --> 01:15:54,120
Why?

1142
01:15:55,164 --> 01:15:57,826
I do not like to see a man
killed in cold blood.

1143
01:16:00,069 --> 01:16:01,263
Thanks.

1144
01:16:13,716 --> 01:16:15,650
<i>Pour one for me, too,
Don Luis.</i>

1145
01:16:16,685 --> 01:16:19,119
I'm going to drink
to your health.

1146
01:16:22,925 --> 01:16:24,222
Ahoy.

1147
01:17:18,547 --> 01:17:20,947
Better be hurrying over
to the hall, Johnny.

1148
01:17:21,317 --> 01:17:23,478
You're not going to the hall,
you're going home.

1149
01:17:23,552 --> 01:17:24,541
Home?

1150
01:17:24,887 --> 01:17:26,445
I got something to tell you.

1151
01:17:26,522 --> 01:17:27,614
You're in trouble.

1152
01:17:27,856 --> 01:17:30,586
I've been in trouble ever
since I became a politician.

1153
01:17:30,893 --> 01:17:33,361
They're gonna try
and kill you, Grandpa.

1154
01:17:33,529 --> 01:17:35,554
Who told you that?
A drunk.

1155
01:17:35,798 --> 01:17:37,789
And you'd be worrying about
the word of a drunk.

1156
01:17:37,967 --> 01:17:40,458
Yes, well, he's dead
for telling me.

1157
01:17:40,736 --> 01:17:41,930
And there's something else
you better know.

1158
01:17:42,004 --> 01:17:43,471
It is I who got
you into this.

1159
01:17:43,539 --> 01:17:45,632
I didn't give a bent nickel
for what you were fighting for.

1160
01:17:45,708 --> 01:17:48,541
I wanted to fix Coffin, and
this was one way of doing it.

1161
01:17:49,144 --> 01:17:50,611
That's why I got you
to run against him.

1162
01:17:50,713 --> 01:17:53,546
Sure. I knew that the day you
brought the boys to see me.

1163
01:17:53,682 --> 01:17:55,707
All the same,
I'm glad you told me.

1164
01:17:55,784 --> 01:17:56,773
You still going?

1165
01:17:56,852 --> 01:17:58,149
Yeah, I'm going.

1166
01:17:58,220 --> 01:17:59,847
It's that important to you?

1167
01:18:00,022 --> 01:18:01,546
Not just to me, Johnny.

1168
01:18:01,657 --> 01:18:03,648
You forget the folks
who voted for me.

1169
01:18:03,726 --> 01:18:04,818
They want a decent government,

1170
01:18:04,893 --> 01:18:07,691
and they kind of thought that
I'd help them to get it.

1171
01:18:07,763 --> 01:18:10,527
They had faith in me. I've
got to keep faith with them.

1172
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:12,965
You should understand that,
Johnny.

1173
01:18:15,337 --> 01:18:16,599
I think I do.

1174
01:18:19,341 --> 01:18:20,899
Well, if it's
that important to you,

1175
01:18:21,043 --> 01:18:23,034
it ought to be
that important to me.

1176
01:18:24,713 --> 01:18:25,702
Let's go.

1177
01:18:27,549 --> 01:18:28,777
I ask you,

1178
01:18:28,951 --> 01:18:31,010
why are certain delegates
in this hall

1179
01:18:31,086 --> 01:18:34,249
so insistent on rushing
California into statehood?

1180
01:18:34,323 --> 01:18:35,847
How can we even discuss it

1181
01:18:35,924 --> 01:18:39,325
when there are so many problems
requiring long and careful study?

1182
01:18:39,395 --> 01:18:41,329
The boundary question,
for one.

1183
01:18:41,397 --> 01:18:44,423
I say this whole measure is
ill-considered and premature.

1184
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:47,168
Statehood now can only make
California a pawn

1185
01:18:47,236 --> 01:18:51,332
in the conflict already threatening
to separate the rest of the country.

1186
01:18:52,941 --> 01:18:54,704
Order! Order!

1187
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:56,834
If this measure is passed,

1188
01:18:57,179 --> 01:19:00,273
it is inevitable that those
favoring an independent empire,

1189
01:19:00,349 --> 01:19:01,941
a republic of California,

1190
01:19:02,051 --> 01:19:04,246
they must either
separate themselves from it

1191
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:06,810
or contest the decision
by force of arms!

1192
01:19:09,591 --> 01:19:11,525
Gentlemen, order!

1193
01:19:11,994 --> 01:19:13,188
Mr. Fabian.

1194
01:19:18,867 --> 01:19:20,767
Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen.

1195
01:19:21,136 --> 01:19:23,104
Talk, talk, talk.

1196
01:19:23,739 --> 01:19:26,299
For five weeks now, there's been
nothing but talk in this hall.

1197
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:29,105
Well, I suppose that's what
a convention is for, talk.

1198
01:19:29,311 --> 01:19:32,144
But a minute or two ago,
Mr. Willoughby was talking

1199
01:19:32,281 --> 01:19:34,306
and he made
a slip of the tongue.

1200
01:19:34,383 --> 01:19:35,407
Ah, more than that.

1201
01:19:35,484 --> 01:19:37,884
Mr. Willoughby let the cat
out of the bag.

1202
01:19:37,986 --> 01:19:39,886
And a clawing, screeching
cat it was,

1203
01:19:39,955 --> 01:19:41,889
and a very thin bag he was in.

1204
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:47,021
Independent empire,
said Mr. Willoughby,

1205
01:19:47,096 --> 01:19:49,758
and then made off
it was a slip of the tongue.

1206
01:19:50,299 --> 01:19:51,789
Ah, it was more than that.

1207
01:19:52,267 --> 01:19:53,996
Independent empire.

1208
01:19:54,736 --> 01:19:56,397
That's the scheme they have,

1209
01:19:56,738 --> 01:19:58,672
the scheme to wreck
this convention

1210
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:00,708
and wreck the future
of California.

1211
01:20:04,313 --> 01:20:05,974
Order!

1212
01:20:06,048 --> 01:20:07,174
Now, I'm a simple farmer.

1213
01:20:07,249 --> 01:20:09,979
What I know is the sun, the
soil, how to make grapes grow.

1214
01:20:10,052 --> 01:20:11,849
I'm not a politician.

1215
01:20:11,954 --> 01:20:14,980
But I know who's in that scheme
for an independent empire.

1216
01:20:15,057 --> 01:20:18,549
And if a simple farmer knows, you
all know, every man jack of you knows.

1217
01:20:18,694 --> 01:20:20,662
And the men in
that terrible scheme

1218
01:20:20,729 --> 01:20:23,664
aren't here to tell you what
the people of California want.

1219
01:20:24,032 --> 01:20:26,432
They're here to tell you
what one man wants.

1220
01:20:27,636 --> 01:20:29,331
You all know who he is.

1221
01:20:29,404 --> 01:20:31,031
Captain Pharaoh Coffin.

1222
01:20:32,441 --> 01:20:33,533
Order!

1223
01:20:33,609 --> 01:20:36,476
That man wants to run
California all for himself,

1224
01:20:36,545 --> 01:20:37,978
but it's us who settled it.

1225
01:20:38,046 --> 01:20:40,879
And it's a land for the people
like all the United States.

1226
01:20:40,949 --> 01:20:44,612
We want to make it a state, not
an empire run by Captain Coffin.

1227
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:47,912
That man's trying to get his
way by bossing this convention.

1228
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:51,221
Next, he'll try it with guns
and wholesale murder.

1229
01:20:51,393 --> 01:20:53,918
Now, I say that's
nothing but treason.

1230
01:20:54,129 --> 01:20:56,097
Here we are, men from
every state in the Union.

1231
01:20:56,165 --> 01:20:58,759
We're farmers and millionaires
and everything else.

1232
01:20:59,034 --> 01:21:02,026
What we want California to be
is what she should be,

1233
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:06,371
another state in what I believe
to be the greatest land on earth.

1234
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,940
Gentlemen, there'll be
a ten minute recess.

1235
01:21:17,386 --> 01:21:18,910
Keep me well covered.

1236
01:21:25,894 --> 01:21:27,361
That was real good!

1237
01:21:31,099 --> 01:21:32,396
Look out!

1238
01:21:45,447 --> 01:21:46,675
Dead.

1239
01:21:46,748 --> 01:21:48,045
He didn't
have a chance.

1240
01:21:49,918 --> 01:21:51,715
Pick him up.

1241
01:21:55,157 --> 01:21:56,784
He was the finest man
I ever knew.

1242
01:22:02,998 --> 01:22:05,990
Nothing but
cold-blooded murder.

1243
01:22:06,868 --> 01:22:09,860
You gotta have some law and
order around here, all right.

1244
01:22:12,307 --> 01:22:14,070
That was
a bad move, Coffin.

1245
01:22:14,142 --> 01:22:16,076
I've nothing left
but powder and shot.

1246
01:22:16,144 --> 01:22:18,374
Not for me.
Me either.

1247
01:22:18,447 --> 01:22:22,042
Personally, I'm going to be on that
stage when it leaves this afternoon.

1248
01:22:22,684 --> 01:22:24,618
Anybody care to join me?

1249
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:43,967
Well, is he here?

1250
01:22:44,139 --> 01:22:45,697
<i>Si, seor,
he is in the chapel.</i>

1251
01:22:45,774 --> 01:22:47,105
Get Miss Lily at once.

1252
01:22:47,175 --> 01:22:48,164
<i>Si, seor:</i>

1253
01:22:49,177 --> 01:22:50,371
Hurry!

1254
01:22:54,616 --> 01:22:56,208
<i>Oh, good morning, Padre:</i>

1255
01:22:56,285 --> 01:22:58,276
You brought your beads,
your things?

1256
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:00,388
What is it you wish of me?

1257
01:23:00,622 --> 01:23:01,611
A wedding.

1258
01:23:01,723 --> 01:23:03,657
The young lady
will be here presently.

1259
01:23:03,725 --> 01:23:05,283
I want you to marry us.

1260
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,349
A wedding?

1261
01:23:06,695 --> 01:23:09,027
And those armed men
are the wedding guests?

1262
01:23:10,599 --> 01:23:12,726
This is more than
a wedding, little man.

1263
01:23:13,101 --> 01:23:15,592
This is a coronation.
I should have got a bishop,

1264
01:23:15,671 --> 01:23:17,332
but you'll do. You'll do.

1265
01:23:17,406 --> 01:23:19,601
I cannot perform
such a ceremony.

1266
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:21,433
What?

1267
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:23,034
There'll be no ceremony.

1268
01:23:23,211 --> 01:23:25,702
<i>Seor Coffin,
you are a man of blood.</i>

1269
01:23:25,847 --> 01:23:29,180
You cannot use the holy church
as you would your chapel.

1270
01:23:29,251 --> 01:23:31,651
Your church,
you and your mumbling breed.

1271
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:34,416
I'll tear out every root
you have in California.

1272
01:23:34,489 --> 01:23:36,821
Your hands cannot
reach deep enough.

1273
01:23:36,892 --> 01:23:39,884
I'll be using your missions
for pigsties, I...

1274
01:23:42,898 --> 01:23:44,627
Where is Miss Lily?

1275
01:23:45,434 --> 01:23:46,992
You heard me, come here.

1276
01:23:49,671 --> 01:23:51,229
Where is Miss Lily?

1277
01:23:51,406 --> 01:23:53,601
Her bed has not been slept in.

1278
01:23:53,675 --> 01:23:54,903
She's gone.

1279
01:24:00,549 --> 01:24:01,846
It's a lie.

1280
01:24:03,618 --> 01:24:04,676
You knew.

1281
01:24:05,387 --> 01:24:07,082
Since last night.

1282
01:24:07,255 --> 01:24:08,517
I helped her.

1283
01:24:11,293 --> 01:24:13,454
Get out, both of you.
Get out.

1284
01:24:17,899 --> 01:24:19,196
Get out!

1285
01:24:36,818 --> 01:24:38,080
Captain.

1286
01:24:39,821 --> 01:24:41,220
Captain.

1287
01:24:46,962 --> 01:24:48,452
It's me, Pike, Captain.

1288
01:24:48,697 --> 01:24:49,925
I got to have a word with you.

1289
01:24:49,998 --> 01:24:52,091
Why haven't you gone?
I gave you my orders.

1290
01:24:52,167 --> 01:24:54,761
Supposin' Fabian ain't back
from Monterey, yet.

1291
01:24:56,204 --> 01:24:57,671
He'll be back.

1292
01:25:00,442 --> 01:25:03,605
If he isn't, there are plenty
of others to dispose of.

1293
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:07,178
Remember,
he's the most important.

1294
01:25:08,183 --> 01:25:09,980
Have done with him.

1295
01:25:11,119 --> 01:25:12,984
And I want no blunders.

1296
01:25:14,823 --> 01:25:16,518
But, Lily,
I can't run away now.

1297
01:25:16,591 --> 01:25:17,853
Michael, you don't seem
to understand.

1298
01:25:17,926 --> 01:25:20,486
You don't know what
Pharaoh Coffin is capable of.

1299
01:25:20,562 --> 01:25:22,359
If I leave with you
and let him have his way,

1300
01:25:22,431 --> 01:25:24,126
I can never come back,
nor can you.

1301
01:25:24,199 --> 01:25:26,599
You know that.
I'm not coming back.

1302
01:25:26,735 --> 01:25:28,965
Once I thought California
would be big enough for me.

1303
01:25:29,037 --> 01:25:30,129
It isn't.

1304
01:25:30,205 --> 01:25:31,729
Everything I've touched,

1305
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:34,608
it's as if it had
a curse on it.

1306
01:25:34,676 --> 01:25:35,938
Even you.

1307
01:25:36,311 --> 01:25:39,007
Oh, Michael, come away
before something happens.

1308
01:25:39,648 --> 01:25:41,047
What's this?

1309
01:25:45,921 --> 01:25:46,910
Hey! Hey!

1310
01:26:53,688 --> 01:26:55,485
I tried to tell him.

1311
01:26:55,790 --> 01:26:57,781
He wouldn't listen to me.

1312
01:26:58,593 --> 01:27:00,117
I was too late.

1313
01:27:03,832 --> 01:27:05,527
We were all too late.

1314
01:27:06,501 --> 01:27:08,298
Better lift him to his cabin.

1315
01:27:54,916 --> 01:27:55,940
Well?

1316
01:27:56,017 --> 01:27:58,485
Well, your orders have been
carried out, Captain.

1317
01:27:58,553 --> 01:27:59,884
Including Fabian?

1318
01:27:59,955 --> 01:28:00,979
We done him in proper.

1319
01:28:01,056 --> 01:28:03,854
He'll make no more speeches
where he's at.

1320
01:28:06,728 --> 01:28:08,389
You came back, Lily.

1321
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,360
Yes, Pharaoh.

1322
01:28:14,369 --> 01:28:15,700
I came back.

1323
01:28:22,877 --> 01:28:24,777
You blundering swine.

1324
01:28:25,647 --> 01:28:27,308
Get out of my sight!

1325
01:28:34,556 --> 01:28:35,853
Lily.

1326
01:28:36,458 --> 01:28:37,550
Lily.

1327
01:28:39,194 --> 01:28:41,594
We're going into town.
Get moving.

1328
01:28:56,344 --> 01:28:58,505
Close the gate!

1329
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,135
Spread out! Spread out!

1330
01:29:27,409 --> 01:29:29,900
Tom, see that every man who
has a rifle uses it now.

1331
01:29:29,978 --> 01:29:31,878
Pick off anyone that shows
his nose over that wall.

1332
01:29:31,946 --> 01:29:33,243
We got to keep it
well covered.

1333
01:29:33,314 --> 01:29:34,679
I'll keep them
all shooting.

1334
01:29:34,749 --> 01:29:36,546
We'll never make it now.
They got the gate shut.

1335
01:29:36,618 --> 01:29:37,812
We've thought of that.

1336
01:29:37,886 --> 01:29:38,944
Frank?
Yeah!

1337
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:40,078
You got it?
I sure have.

1338
01:29:40,155 --> 01:29:41,486
Let me have it.

1339
01:29:54,335 --> 01:29:56,860
Keep us covered!
Come on, Frank, let's go!

1340
01:30:51,192 --> 01:30:54,320
Hey, Frank, Bob!
Come on!

1341
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:08,167
All right,
stick to the walls!

1342
01:31:08,343 --> 01:31:11,039
All right! Wheel it in!

1343
01:31:55,023 --> 01:31:56,354
They've forced the gates,
Captain.

1344
01:31:56,424 --> 01:31:57,789
We're done for, scuppered.

1345
01:31:57,892 --> 01:31:59,359
But I have a pair of horses
by the side patio.

1346
01:31:59,427 --> 01:32:00,985
There might still be time
to make a run for it.

1347
01:32:01,062 --> 01:32:02,552
More water, Elvira.

1348
01:32:03,097 --> 01:32:04,428
We're alone, Pike.

1349
01:32:04,499 --> 01:32:07,525
Stark, Barrett, Willoughby walked
out on me, saved their skins.

1350
01:32:07,602 --> 01:32:11,333
Come on, come on. We'll ride
out of here, get back to the sea.

1351
01:32:13,241 --> 01:32:14,936
Who was it who struck her?

1352
01:32:16,244 --> 01:32:17,802
You must hear me, Captain.

1353
01:32:17,879 --> 01:32:20,109
It's off now or we're dead, both of us.

1354
01:32:21,783 --> 01:32:23,842
It was you who struck her.

1355
01:32:24,252 --> 01:32:25,844
You struck her, Pike.

1356
01:32:27,655 --> 01:32:28,986
Now get out.

1357
01:32:30,191 --> 01:32:31,453
Get out!

1358
01:32:32,627 --> 01:32:34,060
Aye, aye, sir.

1359
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:33,306
What do you say, Bosun?

1360
01:34:33,548 --> 01:34:35,243
How goes the night?

1361
01:34:35,683 --> 01:34:37,207
Where's Pike, eh?

1362
01:34:38,753 --> 01:34:39,742
Pike?

1363
01:34:40,722 --> 01:34:41,711
Pike!

1364
01:34:42,457 --> 01:34:43,651
Pike!

1365
01:34:46,561 --> 01:34:47,721
Hmm.

1366
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:50,554
You betrayed me, huh?

1367
01:34:51,632 --> 01:34:52,963
Took the keys,

1368
01:34:54,102 --> 01:34:55,933
unlocked the chains,

1369
01:34:56,771 --> 01:34:59,205
and set those
Black slaves free,

1370
01:34:59,941 --> 01:35:01,374
hoping they'd help you.

1371
01:35:02,377 --> 01:35:03,708
Help you...

1372
01:35:09,017 --> 01:35:10,382
Where is the sun?

1373
01:35:11,753 --> 01:35:13,277
Where's the sun?

1374
01:35:14,689 --> 01:35:17,419
How can I see a Black
against the dark?

1375
01:35:19,427 --> 01:35:22,055
Only hear them.

1376
01:35:23,431 --> 01:35:24,830
Hear them.

1377
01:35:26,634 --> 01:35:27,931
Pike.

1378
01:35:28,002 --> 01:35:29,799
Pike. Pike! Pike!

1379
01:35:32,974 --> 01:35:35,238
Yes, I know you hate me.

1380
01:35:35,443 --> 01:35:38,879
I took you out of Africa
and the stinking fever.

1381
01:35:39,147 --> 01:35:42,310
I put you in chains, yes.
Yes, but you struck her.

1382
01:35:43,985 --> 01:35:47,819
And now you want to kill
the master, eh?

1383
01:35:47,889 --> 01:35:49,789
Well, you fool!

1384
01:35:51,192 --> 01:35:53,854
What'll you do when the wash
ships over the guns?

1385
01:35:54,529 --> 01:35:57,362
What'll you do when the mast
goes by the board?

1386
01:35:58,266 --> 01:36:01,633
What'll you do when
the night comes down?

1387
01:36:02,136 --> 01:36:05,128
Pike! Pike! Pike!

1388
01:36:06,774 --> 01:36:08,105
Oh!

1389
01:36:08,943 --> 01:36:10,467
So it's you.

1390
01:36:11,746 --> 01:36:13,304
You are going to die.

1391
01:36:30,965 --> 01:36:34,924
I remember these vines when they
were just a bunch of dead sticks.

1392
01:36:35,002 --> 01:36:39,302
You know, it's as if I was
seeing them for the first time,

1393
01:36:40,341 --> 01:36:42,536
the way Michael
always saw them.

1394
01:36:43,144 --> 01:36:45,908
Yes, he saw a lot of
things most folks missed.

1395
01:36:49,117 --> 01:36:50,778
Well, this is goodbye, Lily.

1396
01:36:52,353 --> 01:36:53,945
Where are you off to, Trumbo?

1397
01:36:54,021 --> 01:36:56,285
Got a date with the army,
remember?

1398
01:36:56,991 --> 01:36:58,891
How long does it mean?

1399
01:36:58,993 --> 01:37:00,255
A year.

1400
01:37:00,628 --> 01:37:02,061
Two, maybe.

1401
01:37:03,531 --> 01:37:04,862
Trumbo...

1402
01:37:09,036 --> 01:37:11,197
You'll come back, won't you?

1403
01:37:11,439 --> 01:37:13,031
Where'll you be?

1404
01:37:13,474 --> 01:37:16,204
Right here, waiting.
