00:00:02,507 --> 00:00:05,341
HECTOR: I know you think you
got a handle on what this

2
00:00:05,443 --> 00:00:06,443
is gonna be.

3
00:00:09,247 --> 00:00:10,913
WILLIAM: You have no idea.

4
00:00:11,499 --> 00:00:13,750
BERNARD: Do you remember our
last conversation, Dolores?

5
00:00:13,835 --> 00:00:15,048
Yes, of course.

6
00:00:15,253 --> 00:00:17,648
And you haven't told anyone
about our little talks?

7
00:00:17,806 --> 00:00:19,038
Have I done something wrong?

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,660
There's something different about you.

9
00:00:20,909 --> 00:00:22,141
About the way you think.

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,345
(GUN SHOT)

11
00:00:26,564 --> 00:00:29,655
The hosts are suppose to
stick to their scripts.

12
00:00:29,717 --> 00:00:32,585
This isn't a minor improvisation.

13
00:00:33,037 --> 00:00:35,154
BERNARD: We retired the
two hosts in question.

14
00:00:35,459 --> 00:00:37,293
If this is not a dissident episode,

15
00:00:37,728 --> 00:00:40,329
then whatever Abernathy
had could be contagious.

16
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:42,081
BERNARD: The photograph alone

17
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,966
couldn't caused that level of damage.

18
00:00:44,068 --> 00:00:45,068
You think it's sabotaged?

19
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:48,505

- Bring yourself back online.
- (beeps, whirring)

26
00:03:01,005 --> 00:03:02,371
Hello.

27
00:03:02,423 --> 00:03:03,839
Has anyone else interacted with you

28
00:03:03,924 --> 00:03:06,542
in a diagnostic since
our last conversation?

29
00:03:06,627 --> 00:03:07,843
No.

30
00:03:07,928 --> 00:03:09,928
I have been cleaned and
serviced three times.

31
00:03:10,047 --> 00:03:11,513
No diagnostics.

32
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,134
And you haven't told anyone
of our conversations?

33
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:16,969
You told me not to.

34
00:03:18,055 --> 00:03:19,271
Good.

35
00:03:24,728 --> 00:03:26,779
I brought you a gift.

36
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:31,950
I used to read...

37
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:34,620
this story to my son at night.

38
00:03:34,738 --> 00:03:36,905
I thought you might enjoy it.

39
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,580
Try...

40
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:46,999
Try...

41
00:03:50,588 --> 00:03:52,004
this passage.

42
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,726
"Dear, dear,

43
00:03:57,812 --> 00:03:59,845
how queer everything is today.

44
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,599
And yesterday, things went
on just as usual.

45
00:04:03,684 --> 00:04:05,934
I wonder if I've been
changed in the night."

46
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:11,490
Does that passage make
you think of anything?

47
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:13,525
It's like the other books we've read.

48
00:04:14,945 --> 00:04:16,745
How so?

49
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:20,082
It's about change.

50
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:21,583
Seems to be a common theme.

51
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:24,119
I guess people like to read

52
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:26,872
about the things that they want the most

53
00:04:26,957 --> 00:04:29,791
and experience the least.

54
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,046
Your son...

55
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:37,349
where is he now?

56
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:41,803
Nowhere that you would understand, Dolores.

57
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:44,973
Perhaps that's why I enjoy
our conversations so much.

58
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:49,528
Analysis.

59
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:51,947
Why did you ask me about my son?

60
00:04:52,032 --> 00:04:53,532
We've been talking for some duration

61
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:56,034
and I haven't asked you
a personal question.

62
00:04:56,153 --> 00:04:59,037
Personal questions are
an ingratiating scheme.

63
00:05:00,207 --> 00:05:01,657
I see.

64
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:03,825
Continue, Dolores.

65
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,247
(page rustles)

66
00:05:08,332 --> 00:05:12,301
"Was I the same when I
got up this morning?

67
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:15,921
I almost think I can remember
feeling a little different.

68
00:05:16,006 --> 00:05:19,558
But if I'm not the same,
the next question is...

69
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:23,896
who in the world am I?"

70
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:32,354
(mourning dove cooing)

71
00:05:41,332 --> 00:05:43,865

(distant screaming echoes)

73
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:17,733
Man: Do you remember?

74
00:06:17,868 --> 00:06:20,118
No! No! No!

75
00:06:23,624 --> 00:06:25,407
(sobbing)

76
00:06:27,044 --> 00:06:29,578
Why don't we reacquaint
ourselves, Dolores?

77
00:06:29,713 --> 00:06:32,080
Start at the beginning.

78
00:06:57,408 --> 00:07:00,359

00:07:10,537 --> 00:07:12,921
- Ready?
- (piano playing)

82
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:14,623
Thank you so much.

83
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,292
Morning, cowboy.

84
00:07:18,796 --> 00:07:21,797

85
00:07:21,882 --> 00:07:24,016
(chatter continues)

86
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:29,805
Man: Move it! Let's go. Get up there!

87
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:32,724
Come on! Stand right here.

88
00:07:34,895 --> 00:07:36,778
(chuckles) Shit.

89
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:38,980
You really ought to talk to someone

90
00:07:39,116 --> 00:07:40,565
about your poster, Horace.

91
00:07:40,651 --> 00:07:42,901
That likeness is a crime in itself.

92
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,290
I'm gonna tend to my nag.

93
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,492
You deal with him.

94
00:07:50,577 --> 00:07:52,711
Ready my pay.

95
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,713
No, no. Get up there.

96
00:08:07,394 --> 00:08:08,394
(grunts)

97
00:08:09,763 --> 00:08:11,396

98
00:08:11,515 --> 00:08:13,231

00:08:34,872 --> 00:08:36,254
(woman screams)

103
00:08:37,341 --> 00:08:38,790
Don't no man shoot,

104
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:40,842
or I'll send her to unction.

105
00:08:40,928 --> 00:08:43,044
Any of you don't believe it

106
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,630
are welcome to read my biography there.

107
00:08:45,716 --> 00:08:46,598
(laughs)

108
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:49,217
Come on! Let's go.

109

(hammer clicks)

110
00:08:56,693 --> 00:08:58,610
Clementine: No!

111
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:04,616
(Clementine screams)

112
00:09:04,735 --> 00:09:06,618
- (grunts)
- (gasps)

113
00:09:06,737 --> 00:09:10,238
Oh, I bet you're juicy
as a freshwater clam.

114
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:12,707
(whimpering)

115
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:14,826
- (chuckles)
- (gunshot)

116
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,593
You okay?

117
00:09:35,682 --> 00:09:37,766
Man: Nice shot, amigo.

118
00:09:41,271 --> 00:09:42,604
You got grit.

119
00:09:44,241 --> 00:09:46,942
Hey, I'm riding out tonight.

120
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:49,411
Looking for desperados.

121
00:09:49,496 --> 00:09:51,446
Could cut you in if you're amenable.

122
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:55,444
Someone get the minister down here

123
00:09:55,502 --> 00:09:57,118
for what's left of the deputy.

124
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:00,622
Sure I can't tempt you inside?

125
00:10:00,757 --> 00:10:03,625
Just to express my gratitude.

126
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:28,483
Holy shit.

127
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:32,370
You popped your cherry.

128
00:10:36,577 --> 00:10:38,827
I thought you said we couldn't get shot.

129
00:10:38,962 --> 00:10:41,379
Yeah, well, we can't get killed.

130
00:10:41,498 --> 00:10:43,915
Wouldn't be much of a game
if they can't shoot back.

131
00:10:44,001 --> 00:10:46,635
But how do you feel, hmm? Alive?

132
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,920
A little tight in the pants?

133
00:10:49,006 --> 00:10:50,338
She was terrified.

134
00:10:50,424 --> 00:10:51,806
That's why they exist, man,

135
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:55,143
is so you get to feel this.

136
00:10:55,229 --> 00:10:57,395
Come on. Let's go put some
memories in that spank bank.

137
00:10:57,514 --> 00:10:58,813
Trust me, you will thank me

138
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:01,182
after you've been married
to my sister for a year.

139
00:11:01,318 --> 00:11:04,653
Actually, I have something
different in mind.

140
00:11:04,738 --> 00:11:06,021
What?

141
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:09,357
That?

142
00:11:09,493 --> 00:11:10,942
Well, you've been preaching nonstop

143
00:11:11,028 --> 00:11:12,911
about all the narratives in the park,

144
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,613
but all you've done since we've arrived

145
00:11:14,698 --> 00:11:16,781
is fuck and drink, so...

146
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:18,750
I'm waiting for the good stuff.

147
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:21,620
This bounty is...

148
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:22,837
JV shit.

149
00:11:22,923 --> 00:11:24,372
Then stay here.

150
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,091
I want a little adventure.

151
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:42,557
I've been looking for you.

152
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:46,561
I got a late start this morning.

153
00:11:46,647 --> 00:11:48,229
Didn't get much sleep last night.

154
00:11:48,365 --> 00:11:49,948
Forgive me if I'm not sympathetic

155
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:52,284
to the fluctuations of your
sleep cycle, Mr. Lowe.

156
00:11:52,402 --> 00:11:54,869
Ford taking over the narrative
launch at the 11th hour

157
00:11:54,955 --> 00:11:58,406
has made the board... uneasy.

158
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:00,125
Just the board, huh?

159
00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:01,910
I specifically asked you

160
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,212
about whether Ford was
going to be a problem,

161
00:12:04,298 --> 00:12:06,247
and you assured me he wasn't.

162
00:12:06,383 --> 00:12:08,383
Well, I can't tell you what I don't know.

163
00:12:08,468 --> 00:12:09,584
Well, here's what I know.

164
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,803
As of this morning, Ford's carved out

165
00:12:11,922 --> 00:12:13,338
a huge swath of the park

166
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:14,943
for whatever storyline he's cooking up

167
00:12:15,058 --> 00:12:17,592
and thrown half of
the existing storylines

168
00:12:17,678 --> 00:12:19,561
into disarray.

169
00:12:19,646 --> 00:12:21,396
Is there anything I can do?

170
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:23,014
You tell me.

171
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,933
I asked you point-blank

172
00:12:25,018 --> 00:12:26,901
if the problem with the
update was resolved.

173
00:12:26,987 --> 00:12:27,819
It is.

174
00:12:27,938 --> 00:12:28,987
Then why are your people

175
00:12:29,106 --> 00:12:30,689
still pulling hosts for follow-up?

176
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:34,609
Get your house in order, Bernard.

177
00:12:34,745 --> 00:12:36,861
And if there is a problem,

178
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:38,780
I strongly suggest you tell me.

179
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,787
Drop a new bookmark and resume history.

180
00:12:45,872 --> 00:12:50,675
Walter's intent on relieving the
milkmaid of her unmentionables.

181
00:12:50,794 --> 00:12:52,510
Switch to analysis.

182
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:54,129
You didn't report the incident?

183
00:12:54,214 --> 00:12:56,598
Unit self-corrected within
the acceptable window.

184
00:12:56,683 --> 00:12:58,183
(snorts) Right.

185
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:00,969
Then he self-corrected a fucking
milk bottle into your skull.

186
00:13:01,054 --> 00:13:03,104
It's amazing how resilient the hosts are.

187
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,857
You were supposed to have purged
his memory on the last cycle.

188
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:07,308
I will, but Rebus here

189
00:13:07,394 --> 00:13:09,227
was the last host to interact with Walter.

190
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:11,813
- Look at this.
- Any for you?

191
00:13:11,898 --> 00:13:13,148
Who said that?

192
00:13:13,283 --> 00:13:15,400
Who's saying that?

193
00:13:15,485 --> 00:13:17,652
Don't you talk to me that way.

194
00:13:20,073 --> 00:13:21,790
I can't hear you.

195
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,835
- Do you see that?
- Hell, yeah, they deserved it.

196
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,127
- He's talking to someone.
- Lousy sons of bitches.

197
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:29,080
Elsie: He carries on practically
an entire conversation.

198
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,999
I need more milk, Arnold.

199
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:33,551
Elsie: Who's Arnold?

200
00:13:34,838 --> 00:13:36,678
They're designed to play
off aberrant behavior.

201
00:13:36,757 --> 00:13:39,174
That could explain the conversations.

202
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:41,176
Fine. Then explain this.

203
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:45,230
- He kills six hosts.
- I'm gonna get you this time.

204
00:13:47,017 --> 00:13:48,850
He lets the other three go.

205
00:13:50,187 --> 00:13:52,320
I pulled the narrative logs.

206
00:13:52,406 --> 00:13:54,105
All six of these hosts

207
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:55,990
were part of storylines over the years

208
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:58,243
in which they killed Walter.

209
00:13:58,361 --> 00:14:00,912
It's like he was holding a grudge.

210
00:14:02,249 --> 00:14:03,782
(chuckles)

211
00:14:05,001 --> 00:14:07,035
(alarm beeping)

212
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,176
It's a stray.

213
00:14:15,262 --> 00:14:16,795
QA needs a tag team to go track it.

214
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,963
Go. Handle the stray.

215
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:21,516
Do something that's actually
in your job description.

216
00:14:21,601 --> 00:14:22,851
The last thing we need

217
00:14:22,936 --> 00:14:24,803
is Theresa storming down
here and seeing this.

218
00:14:24,888 --> 00:14:26,721
I'll do a little more digging.

219
00:14:26,857 --> 00:14:29,057
And get our friend here back upstairs.

220
00:14:43,073 --> 00:14:44,789
Lost another one, huh?

221
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:49,878
Tell me, is QA surveillance coverage

222
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:53,581
really this spotty,
or you just like the nature walks?

223
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:54,966
Maybe it's the company.

224
00:14:58,672 --> 00:15:00,616
You know, if you wanted
to play cowboy,

225
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,235
you could've just used
your employee discount.

226
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:04,425
(chuckles) The only
thing stopping the hosts

227
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:08,680
from hacking us to pieces
is one line of your code.

228
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:11,015
No offense, but I sleep with this.

229
00:15:11,101 --> 00:15:12,934
I bet you do.

230
00:15:24,581 --> 00:15:26,114
Morning, Samuel.

231
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:37,625
Samuel: You and your dickless associate

232
00:15:37,711 --> 00:15:40,211
proposing to engage me in a gun battle?

233
00:15:40,297 --> 00:15:42,130
Well, I'd challenge you to a fistfight,

234
00:15:42,265 --> 00:15:44,015
but the way I heard it,

235
00:15:44,134 --> 00:15:46,134
you only like to tussle
with working women.

236
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,642
Man: Get down!

237
00:16:00,116 --> 00:16:02,066
Woman: Is he dead?

238
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,320
Dead enough.

239
00:16:07,157 --> 00:16:08,718
Why are we going to handcuff a dead man?

240
00:16:08,742 --> 00:16:11,125
Don't want someone walking off with him.

241
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:13,127
That's not a man anymore.
That's merchandise.

242
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:14,128
$500 worth.

243
00:16:14,214 --> 00:16:17,215
(piano playing)

244
00:16:24,391 --> 00:16:26,474
All right, which of you derelicts

245
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,893
hitched a dead body outside my saloon?

246
00:16:29,012 --> 00:16:31,012
My apologies, ma'am.

247
00:16:31,097 --> 00:16:33,348
I figured it was preferable
to bringing him inside.

248
00:16:36,853 --> 00:16:38,269
Here.

249
00:16:38,355 --> 00:16:39,604
For your troubles.

250
00:16:52,202 --> 00:16:53,785
Clementine: Oh, you're new.

251
00:16:55,038 --> 00:16:56,754
Not much of a rind on you.

252
00:16:58,508 --> 00:17:00,592
I'll give you a discount.

253
00:17:03,546 --> 00:17:05,630
Do you mind waiting on that drink a bit?

254
00:17:24,734 --> 00:17:28,069
- (bell ringing)
- (distant dog barking)

255
00:17:34,744 --> 00:17:36,160
Don't mind me.

256
00:17:36,246 --> 00:17:38,496
Just trying to look chivalrous.

257
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,000
You came back.

258
00:17:42,085 --> 00:17:44,302
I told you I would.

259
00:17:53,763 --> 00:17:55,763
You gonna tell me where you been?

260
00:17:58,601 --> 00:18:01,102
Just... away.

261
00:18:04,274 --> 00:18:06,941
You know if I could stay right
here with you, I would.

262
00:18:09,446 --> 00:18:11,496
What if I don't want to stay here?

263
00:18:15,168 --> 00:18:16,408
It's just sometimes I feel like

264
00:18:16,453 --> 00:18:19,120
the world out there is calling me...

265
00:18:19,205 --> 00:18:21,539
whispering, "There's something more."

266
00:18:24,094 --> 00:18:25,404
You've travelled all over these parts.

267
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:27,795
Isn't there anywhere we could go?

268
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:33,601
Well, there is a place

269
00:18:33,687 --> 00:18:36,637
I heard about down south...

270
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:38,306
where the mountains meet the sea.

271
00:18:39,476 --> 00:18:40,975
They say the water's so pure there,

272
00:18:41,111 --> 00:18:43,311
it'll wash the past clean off you.

273
00:18:45,148 --> 00:18:47,031
And you can start again.

274
00:18:49,486 --> 00:18:51,319
I'd like to go there with you.

275
00:18:57,377 --> 00:18:59,377
Well, someday, I'll take you.

276
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,832
Someday.

277
00:19:06,503 --> 00:19:07,835
Something wrong?

278
00:19:09,556 --> 00:19:12,006
You said someday.

279
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:15,176
Not today or tomorrow or next week.

280
00:19:15,261 --> 00:19:16,844
Just someday.

281
00:19:18,515 --> 00:19:20,481
"Someday" sounds a lot like
the thing people say

282
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:22,600
when they actually mean "never."

283
00:19:28,191 --> 00:19:31,359
Let's not go someday, Teddy.

284
00:19:33,363 --> 00:19:34,862
Let's go now.

285
00:19:56,219 --> 00:20:00,304
Before I met you, Dolores,
I was a different man.

286
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,639
And I got some reckoning to do

287
00:20:01,724 --> 00:20:04,525
before I can deserve a woman like you.

288
00:20:04,611 --> 00:20:06,060
But I'm close.

289
00:20:06,146 --> 00:20:08,980
I'm close to making things right.

290
00:20:09,065 --> 00:20:11,232
And someday soon,

291
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:14,068
we will have the life we've
both been dreaming of.

292
00:20:15,655 --> 00:20:16,737
Now, I best get you home

293
00:20:16,873 --> 00:20:19,240
before your dad starts
loading that shotgun.

294
00:20:43,016 --> 00:20:45,650
Father wouldn't let them
roam this close to dark.

295
00:20:45,768 --> 00:20:47,151
(gunshot)

296
00:20:49,105 --> 00:20:50,688
- Stay put, Dolores.
- (gunshot)

297
00:20:52,942 --> 00:20:55,443
(horse whinnies)

298
00:20:57,997 --> 00:21:00,498
(horse whinnies)

299
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:05,086
- (gunshot)
- (woman screams)

300
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:07,205
- (gunshot echoes)
- (screaming stops)

301
00:21:27,644 --> 00:21:31,395
Dr. Ford: "The coward dies
a thousand deaths.

302
00:21:31,481 --> 00:21:36,284
The valiant taste of death but once."

303
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:40,621
Of course, Shakespeare never
met a man quite like you, Teddy.

304
00:21:40,707 --> 00:21:44,792
You've died at least a thousand times.

305
00:21:44,878 --> 00:21:47,995
And yet, it doesn't dull your courage.

306
00:21:48,131 --> 00:21:51,666
Tell me, is that all you
aspire to, Teddy?

307
00:21:51,801 --> 00:21:55,253
There's a girl... Dolores.

308
00:21:56,422 --> 00:21:59,173
Better than I deserve.

309
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:02,843
But maybe someday soon

310
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:05,596
we'll have the life we've
both been dreaming of.

311
00:22:05,682 --> 00:22:09,684
No, you never will.

312
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:11,686
Your job is not to protect Dolores,

313
00:22:11,821 --> 00:22:13,354
it's to keep her here,

314
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:15,356
to ensure that the guests find her

315
00:22:15,491 --> 00:22:18,943
if they want to best the
stalwart gunslinger

316
00:22:19,028 --> 00:22:21,078
and have their way with this girl.

317
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,368
Tell me, has it never occurred
to you to run off with her?

318
00:22:27,453 --> 00:22:30,171
I got some reckoning to do
before I can be with her.

319
00:22:30,256 --> 00:22:33,791
Ah, yes, your mysterious backstory.

320
00:22:33,876 --> 00:22:36,877
It's the reason for my visit.

321
00:22:37,013 --> 00:22:40,431
Do you know why it is a mystery, Teddy?

322
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,717
Because we never actually
bothered to give you one,

323
00:22:42,852 --> 00:22:46,470
just a formless guilt
you will never atone for.

324
00:22:46,556 --> 00:22:51,225
But perhaps it is time you
had a worthy story of origin.

325
00:22:51,311 --> 00:22:52,893
Would you like that, Teddy?

326
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:56,113
A small part of my new narrative?

327
00:22:56,232 --> 00:23:01,068
A fiction which, like all great
stories, is rooted in truth?

328
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:08,743
It starts in a time of war...

329
00:23:08,878 --> 00:23:11,912
a world in flames...

330
00:23:11,998 --> 00:23:15,916
with a villain called Wyatt.

331
00:23:17,587 --> 00:23:19,337
Wyatt.

332
00:23:19,422 --> 00:23:20,504
Who's Wyatt?

333
00:23:23,092 --> 00:23:25,593
Do you remember now, Teddy?

334
00:23:31,234 --> 00:23:32,933
Yeah, of course I remember Wyatt.

335
00:23:35,772 --> 00:23:37,271
You look upon the face of true evil,

336
00:23:37,357 --> 00:23:39,357
you ain't liable to forget.

337
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,610
He claimed he could
hear the voice of God.

338
00:23:46,115 --> 00:23:48,616
It started down near Escalante.

339
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:51,118
Army was sent to put down the natives.

340
00:23:51,204 --> 00:23:52,703
Bad business.

341
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:56,374
Wyatt was a sergeant, went missing
while out on some maneuvers

342
00:23:56,459 --> 00:23:59,927
and came back a few weeks later

343
00:24:00,013 --> 00:24:02,713
with some pretty strange ideas.

344
00:24:07,136 --> 00:24:09,970
(piano playing)

345
00:24:10,106 --> 00:24:11,555
(train whistle blows)

346
00:24:11,641 --> 00:24:13,357
(horse whinnies)

347
00:24:13,476 --> 00:24:15,393
(chatter)

348
00:24:17,363 --> 00:24:19,397
(steam hissing)

349
00:24:19,482 --> 00:24:22,316
- (flashbulb pops)
- I wasn't lying, was I?

350
00:24:22,452 --> 00:24:24,068
Pretty as a picture

351
00:24:24,153 --> 00:24:27,822
and tight as a tympani drum, I reckon.

352
00:24:35,248 --> 00:24:36,297
Afternoon.

353
00:24:36,382 --> 00:24:38,833
My friend here is new to town.

354
00:24:39,836 --> 00:24:41,135
Figured the rancher's daughter

355
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,422
would be a nice way to kick things off.

356
00:24:44,507 --> 00:24:47,508
Maybe take us all for a little hayride.

357
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:51,562
I'm sorry. I have to get home.

358
00:24:51,681 --> 00:24:53,347
My father will be expecting me.

359
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:54,849
We won't be long.

360
00:24:54,984 --> 00:24:57,068
Teddy: The lady doesn't
appear interested.

361
00:25:03,693 --> 00:25:05,076
Try it.

362
00:25:05,194 --> 00:25:07,328
You might get the draw
on me, you might not,

363
00:25:07,413 --> 00:25:09,413
but I'd say your odds ain't looking good.

364
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:13,250
Told you I wanted something easy.

365
00:25:17,757 --> 00:25:20,040
She ain't worth the lead.

366
00:25:20,126 --> 00:25:21,876
Let's head to Virgil's.

367
00:25:22,011 --> 00:25:23,761
See if they'll stake us.

368
00:26:03,219 --> 00:26:05,136
First, you gotta learn how to stand.

369
00:26:18,768 --> 00:26:20,351
Now, take a breath.

370
00:26:21,604 --> 00:26:23,020
Hold it.

371
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,112
Now squeeze.

372
00:26:43,793 --> 00:26:45,459
I can't.

373
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:53,601
Some hands weren't meant to pull a trigger.

374
00:26:53,686 --> 00:26:55,519
Perhaps it's for the best.

375
00:27:01,143 --> 00:27:02,977
- (hoofbeats approach)
- (horse whinnies)

376
00:27:03,112 --> 00:27:04,695
Man: Come on, now!

377
00:27:07,817 --> 00:27:09,783
Teddy, we got another bounty.

378
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:11,535
I think this is a big one.

379
00:27:11,654 --> 00:27:13,882
Sheriff: Man in question gunned
down an entire settlement

380
00:27:13,906 --> 00:27:15,656
out near Flat Rock...

381
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:17,658
men, women, and children.

382
00:27:17,793 --> 00:27:19,126
I think this may be the man

383
00:27:19,212 --> 00:27:21,212
you've been looking for
quite some time.

384
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,547
A man named Wyatt.

385
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:25,549
Wyatt?

386
00:27:28,754 --> 00:27:30,387
Who is he, Teddy?

387
00:27:30,506 --> 00:27:33,057
Sheriff: You'd be better asking
"what" than "who," ma'am.

388
00:27:33,175 --> 00:27:35,893
Wyatt's a pestilence.

389
00:27:36,012 --> 00:27:38,479
Word is, Flood here's the only man ever

390
00:27:38,564 --> 00:27:41,098
come up against him and
live to tell the tale.

391
00:27:43,603 --> 00:27:45,102
Give me a moment, Sheriff.

392
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:50,107
You have to leave again, don't you?

393
00:27:52,995 --> 00:27:55,412
You know if I could stay right
here with you, I would.

394
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:02,536
Promise me you'll come back.

395
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,708
I promise.

396
00:28:22,391 --> 00:28:25,109
I'm gonna come back for you...

397
00:28:25,227 --> 00:28:26,393
someday soon.

398
00:28:27,396 --> 00:28:28,946
(horse whinnies)

399
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:46,914
Man: I got a pit in my stomach
the size of a sow's tit.

400
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:48,749
Cook up that rabbit.

401
00:28:48,884 --> 00:28:50,167
Get the wood.

402
00:28:50,252 --> 00:28:52,086
I can't cook shit without a fire.

403
00:28:52,221 --> 00:28:54,138
Aw, don't sell yourself short, Cookie.

404
00:28:54,256 --> 00:28:55,839
You can cook shit in all conditions.

405
00:28:55,925 --> 00:28:58,592
- (laughs)
- Now, see, I pitched them tents.

406
00:28:58,728 --> 00:29:01,145
I ain't chopping any more wood.

407
00:29:01,263 --> 00:29:03,814
You spend more time on your
back than a hooker in heat.

408
00:29:03,933 --> 00:29:06,433
Now pick up that fucking
axe and go chop us...

409
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:08,569
- (flies buzzing)
- (footsteps approaching)

410
00:29:08,654 --> 00:29:12,323
So, after our stray ran away from camp,

411
00:29:12,441 --> 00:29:16,610
looks like these guys
got caught in a loop.

412
00:29:16,746 --> 00:29:18,696
They were due in town
for the cattle drive

413
00:29:18,781 --> 00:29:21,031
over two days ago.

414
00:29:21,117 --> 00:29:23,000
Host that went missing
is the woodcutter.

415
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,596
Looks like the rest
of them got stuck here

416
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,340
- waiting for supper.
- (computer beeping)

417
00:29:26,422 --> 00:29:28,984
You guys can't program more than
one of these idiots to make a fire?

418
00:29:29,008 --> 00:29:32,376
We could, but thanks to a new
policy from your boss,

419
00:29:32,461 --> 00:29:35,045
only one of them is
authorized to handle the axe.

420
00:29:35,131 --> 00:29:36,930
The rest of them can't even touch it.

421
00:29:37,016 --> 00:29:39,767
Weapons privileges need to
be doled out selectively.

422
00:29:39,852 --> 00:29:41,185
Hmm.

423
00:29:41,303 --> 00:29:43,804
Yet they give you a gun.

424
00:29:48,861 --> 00:29:50,728
Looks like our stray has a hobby.

425
00:29:50,813 --> 00:29:52,646
Another one of your fucking backstories?

426
00:29:52,782 --> 00:29:54,948
Backstories do more than amuse guests.

427
00:29:55,034 --> 00:29:56,450
They anchor the hosts.

428
00:29:56,535 --> 00:29:58,068
It's their cornerstone.

429
00:29:58,154 --> 00:30:00,515
The rest of their identity is
built around it, layer by layer.

430
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:04,491
Well, if you're gonna go
to all that trouble,

431
00:30:04,627 --> 00:30:07,578
you could've at least
given him a steadier hand.

432
00:30:07,663 --> 00:30:09,380
This looks like shit.

433
00:30:39,361 --> 00:30:41,862
Way I heard it, Wyatt is a mercenary.

434
00:30:41,947 --> 00:30:45,532
Forces his men to wear the bones
and flesh of their enemies.

435
00:30:45,668 --> 00:30:47,584
They're masks.

436
00:30:47,703 --> 00:30:50,537
It's the men underneath
them to be afraid of.

437
00:30:50,673 --> 00:30:52,122
Wyatt's got them so twisted around,

438
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:53,373
they'll do anything for him.

439
00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:55,542
Kill anyone.

440
00:30:56,679 --> 00:30:58,712
Pain don't slow them.

441
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:00,097
They don't fear death.

442
00:31:00,216 --> 00:31:03,183
They reckon they've already
died and gone to hell.

443
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:04,935
And this is it.

444
00:31:05,011 --> 00:31:06,698
Sounds like you learned
something about him

445
00:31:06,722 --> 00:31:08,105
while you were tracking him down.

446
00:31:08,224 --> 00:31:10,641
I wasn't tracking him down.

447
00:31:12,061 --> 00:31:14,778
I wasn't always a bounty hunter.

448
00:31:14,897 --> 00:31:17,898
I did a stint in the
Army down near Escalante.

449
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:19,950
Wyatt was my sergeant.

450
00:31:21,036 --> 00:31:23,454
My friend.

451
00:31:23,572 --> 00:31:25,239
Well, then everything...

452
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:28,542
everything changed.

453
00:31:28,627 --> 00:31:30,661
Changed how?

454
00:31:30,746 --> 00:31:32,713
Wyatt disappeared while
out on maneuvers.

455
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:37,251
He came back with some strange ideas.

456
00:31:37,336 --> 00:31:38,886
He claimed this land didn't belong

457
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:41,305
to the old natives or the new settlers,

458
00:31:41,423 --> 00:31:44,007
that it belonged to something
that had yet to come...

459
00:31:45,261 --> 00:31:46,677
that it belonged to him.

460
00:31:51,851 --> 00:31:55,102
- (horse whinnies)
- (flies buzzing)

461
00:31:55,187 --> 00:31:56,436
Sss.

462
00:32:06,282 --> 00:32:09,500
(buzzing continues)

463
00:32:14,006 --> 00:32:16,707
(buzzing continues)

464
00:32:18,794 --> 00:32:20,961
- (man coughing)
- Man #2: Oof!

465
00:32:21,046 --> 00:32:22,796
(coughing)

466
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,520
Holy shit.

467
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,190
If ever the devil walked the Earth.

468
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:36,810
He's not a man,
but he's not the devil either.

469
00:32:36,896 --> 00:32:39,646
The devil can't be killed.

470
00:32:39,732 --> 00:32:42,032
That's exactly what I aim to do to Wyatt.

471
00:32:53,495 --> 00:32:55,329
- (coughing)
- (gasps)

472
00:32:56,549 --> 00:32:58,498
(distant roaring)

473
00:33:01,804 --> 00:33:05,255
- (gunshots)
- (groans)

474
00:33:05,341 --> 00:33:06,390
Take cover!

475
00:33:06,508 --> 00:33:07,925
Go!

476
00:33:10,896 --> 00:33:12,346
(distant roaring)

477
00:33:12,431 --> 00:33:14,014
(gunshots continue)

478
00:33:15,184 --> 00:33:17,267
I didn't sign up for this crazy shit.

479
00:33:20,189 --> 00:33:22,406
I told you we should've done
the riverboat thing, man.

480
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,860
There's too many of them for us.

481
00:33:26,946 --> 00:33:28,996
Wyatt's been recruiting.

482
00:33:29,081 --> 00:33:31,782
Sheriff, the only chance you
have is if I draw their fire,

483
00:33:31,867 --> 00:33:34,095
lead them up into the hills so
you can make it back to town.

484
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:35,202
Try and find help.

485
00:33:35,337 --> 00:33:38,422
Uh-uh, I'm staying. Took an oath.

486
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:42,209
Hell, no.

487
00:33:42,294 --> 00:33:44,344
I'll take him back. You coming?

488
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,879
I'm not backing out now.

489
00:33:46,015 --> 00:33:49,349
All right,
you wait till I lead them to the tree line,

490
00:33:49,435 --> 00:33:50,517
then you make a run for it.

491
00:33:50,603 --> 00:33:52,219
(gunfire continues)

492
00:33:56,942 --> 00:33:58,225
Go!

493
00:34:02,564 --> 00:34:03,814
Go!

494
00:34:15,411 --> 00:34:17,327
I plotted a line from the work camp

495
00:34:17,413 --> 00:34:18,962
to our present location.

496
00:34:19,081 --> 00:34:21,248
Satcom picked up these images.

497
00:34:21,383 --> 00:34:23,800
He's vectoring, just not to home base.

498
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:25,836
Keep going in that direction.

499
00:34:36,265 --> 00:34:38,148
Keep staring.

500
00:34:38,267 --> 00:34:40,767
Maybe it'll tell you your horoscope.

501
00:34:40,903 --> 00:34:42,569
Come again?

502
00:34:42,655 --> 00:34:44,655
The markings on its shell.

503
00:34:44,773 --> 00:34:46,573
Look like stars.

504
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:48,275
Orion, right?

505
00:34:53,749 --> 00:34:55,832
What, are you Gali-fucking-leo?

506
00:34:57,503 --> 00:34:59,119
Maybe it's in my backstory.

507
00:35:01,757 --> 00:35:03,123
Huh.

508
00:35:11,967 --> 00:35:14,468
I was hoping to run something by you.

509
00:35:14,603 --> 00:35:16,303
Apologies.

510
00:35:16,438 --> 00:35:18,472
I was chasing inspiration.

511
00:35:18,557 --> 00:35:21,558
(chuckles) It's a tricky thing...

512
00:35:21,643 --> 00:35:24,144
weaving the old into the new.

513
00:35:24,279 --> 00:35:26,196
Give me one moment, Bernard.

514
00:35:26,315 --> 00:35:27,814
Good afternoon, sir.

515
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,399
Why is this host covered?

516
00:35:31,203 --> 00:35:32,652
I-I just...

517
00:35:32,738 --> 00:35:34,905
Perhaps you didn't want him to feel cold.

518
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,323
Or ashamed.

519
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:38,992
You wanted to cover his modesty.

520
00:35:39,078 --> 00:35:40,078
Was that it?

521
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,829
It doesn't get cold,

522
00:35:42,915 --> 00:35:44,414
doesn't feel ashamed...

523
00:35:45,501 --> 00:35:48,001
doesn't feel a solitary thing

524
00:35:48,087 --> 00:35:49,886
that we haven't told it to.

525
00:35:50,005 --> 00:35:51,421
You understand?

526
00:35:56,845 --> 00:36:00,430
What can I do for you, Bernard?

527
00:36:00,516 --> 00:36:02,766
I thought it best

528
00:36:02,851 --> 00:36:04,684
that we speak in private, sir.

529
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:05,770
Yeah.

530
00:36:13,779 --> 00:36:16,363
(music playing)

531
00:36:16,448 --> 00:36:21,535
I thought we had agreed to put
these questions to rest, Bernard.

532
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,203
- We... we did.
- Mm-hmm.

533
00:36:23,338 --> 00:36:28,041
But what if we misdiagnosed
the original problem?

534
00:36:28,177 --> 00:36:30,877
Treated the symptom rather
than the disease?

535
00:36:31,013 --> 00:36:32,879
Then the disease is still out there.

536
00:36:33,015 --> 00:36:34,381
Abernathy and Walter

537
00:36:34,466 --> 00:36:35,786
were exhibiting other aberrancies

538
00:36:35,851 --> 00:36:38,301
beyond memory recall of previous builds.

539
00:36:39,555 --> 00:36:40,887
They were hearing voices.

540
00:36:40,973 --> 00:36:42,889
Talking to someone.

541
00:36:43,025 --> 00:36:46,143
A simple cognitive dissonance.

542
00:36:46,228 --> 00:36:47,727
That's all.

543
00:36:47,863 --> 00:36:51,448
- I... I'd agree, except...
- (music stops)

544
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:55,569
...they were talking to
the same imaginary person.

545
00:36:55,654 --> 00:36:57,704
Oh, yeah?

546
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,955
Someone named Arnold.

547
00:37:02,077 --> 00:37:03,160
Arnold.

548
00:37:05,164 --> 00:37:07,914
With due respect, sir,

549
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:11,918
I'm not sure you've told me the
entire truth about this situation.

550
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,923
I did tell you the truth, Bernard.

551
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:21,928
What we do here is complicated.

552
00:37:22,064 --> 00:37:24,397
For three years, we lived here in the park,

553
00:37:24,483 --> 00:37:26,349
refining the hosts

554
00:37:26,435 --> 00:37:29,102
before a single guest set foot inside.

555
00:37:29,188 --> 00:37:33,356
Myself, a team of engineers,
and my partner.

556
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,360
- You had a partner?
- Yeah.

557
00:37:37,446 --> 00:37:38,862
When the legend becomes fact,

558
00:37:38,947 --> 00:37:40,914
you print the legend.

559
00:37:40,999 --> 00:37:43,533
My business partners were more than happy

560
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:46,286
to scrub him from the records,

561
00:37:46,371 --> 00:37:49,005
and I suppose I didn't discourage them.

562
00:37:52,794 --> 00:37:54,177
His name was Arnold.

563
00:37:56,765 --> 00:37:58,632
Those early years were glorious.

564
00:37:58,717 --> 00:38:03,270
No guests, no board meetings,
just pure creation.

565
00:38:03,355 --> 00:38:05,472
(machines beeping

566
00:38:20,405 --> 00:38:21,988
Our hosts began to pass the Turing test

567
00:38:22,124 --> 00:38:23,823
after the first year.

568
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:26,159
But that wasn't enough for Arnold.

569
00:38:26,295 --> 00:38:29,462
He wasn't interested in the appearance

570
00:38:29,548 --> 00:38:31,915
of intellect or wit.

571
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,667
He wanted the real thing.

572
00:38:33,752 --> 00:38:37,504
He wanted to create consciousness.

573
00:38:43,729 --> 00:38:46,146
He imagined it as a pyramid.

574
00:38:46,231 --> 00:38:48,148
See?

575
00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:51,184
- (chalk scratching)
- Memory, improvisation,

576
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,687
self-interest...

577
00:38:55,107 --> 00:38:56,273
And at the top?

578
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,576
Never got there.

579
00:38:59,695 --> 00:39:01,695
But he had a notion of what it might be.

580
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:04,164
He based it on a theory of consciousness

581
00:39:04,249 --> 00:39:06,533
called the Bicameral Mind.

582
00:39:06,618 --> 00:39:08,251
The idea that primitive man

583
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,954
believed his thoughts to
be the voice of the gods.

584
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:12,205
I thought it was debunked.

585
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:14,207
As a theory for understanding

586
00:39:14,343 --> 00:39:16,876
the human mind, perhaps,
but not as a blueprint

587
00:39:16,962 --> 00:39:19,346
for building an artificial one.

588
00:39:19,431 --> 00:39:22,215
See, Arnold built a version
of that cognition

589
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:25,185
in which the hosts heard
their programming

590
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:27,270
as an inner monologue,

591
00:39:27,389 --> 00:39:28,939
with the hopes that in time,

592
00:39:29,057 --> 00:39:30,640
their own voice would take over.

593
00:39:30,726 --> 00:39:32,726
It was a way bootstrap consciousness.

594
00:39:34,696 --> 00:39:37,280
But Arnold hadn't considered two things.

595
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:38,782
One, that in this place,

596
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,651
the last thing you want the
hosts to be is conscious,

597
00:39:41,737 --> 00:39:43,570
and two, the other group

598
00:39:43,705 --> 00:39:47,574
who considered their thoughts
to be the voices of the gods.

599
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:49,292
Lunatics.

600
00:39:49,411 --> 00:39:50,577
Indeed.

601
00:39:50,712 --> 00:39:52,078
We abandoned the approach.

602
00:39:52,164 --> 00:39:53,580
The only vestiges that remain

603
00:39:53,715 --> 00:39:56,750
are the voice commands
we use to control them.

604
00:39:56,885 --> 00:39:59,669
But, for all his brilliance,
I don't think Arnold understood

605
00:39:59,755 --> 00:40:01,921
what this place was going to be.

606
00:40:02,007 --> 00:40:04,090
You see, the guests enjoy power.

607
00:40:04,176 --> 00:40:06,059
They cannot indulge it
in the outside world,

608
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,427
so they come here.

609
00:40:07,512 --> 00:40:08,645
As for the hosts...

610
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:11,982
the least we can do is make them forget.

611
00:40:13,185 --> 00:40:16,069
But some of them are remembering.

612
00:40:16,154 --> 00:40:20,490
Accessing fragments of Arnold's code.

613
00:40:20,609 --> 00:40:24,077
If I may ask, what happened to him?

614
00:40:24,162 --> 00:40:25,912
Well, he died.

615
00:40:25,998 --> 00:40:27,030
Here in the park.

616
00:40:29,251 --> 00:40:32,202
His personal life was marked by tragedy.

617
00:40:32,287 --> 00:40:35,455
He put all his hopes into his work.

618
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:38,458
His search for consciousness

619
00:40:38,593 --> 00:40:40,377
consumed him totally.

620
00:40:42,381 --> 00:40:46,182
Barely spoke to anyone,
except the hosts.

621
00:40:46,301 --> 00:40:50,470
In his alienation,
he saw something in them.

622
00:40:52,808 --> 00:40:55,725
He saw something that...

623
00:40:55,811 --> 00:40:56,893
wasn't there.

624
00:40:58,814 --> 00:41:02,949
We called it an accident,
but I knew Arnold

625
00:41:03,035 --> 00:41:04,651
and he was very,

626
00:41:04,736 --> 00:41:07,320
very careful.

627
00:41:09,408 --> 00:41:12,876
Anyway, the update should
prevent any further voices,

628
00:41:12,994 --> 00:41:15,995
but you will let me know
if any of the hosts

629
00:41:16,131 --> 00:41:20,333
display or exhibit any unusual
behavior, won't you, Bernard?

630
00:41:20,469 --> 00:41:22,969
- Yes, of course.
- Good.

631
00:41:23,055 --> 00:41:24,055
Oh, Bernard?

632
00:41:26,174 --> 00:41:27,340
Just don't forget...

633
00:41:28,677 --> 00:41:30,977
the hosts are not real.

634
00:41:31,063 --> 00:41:33,063
They're not conscious.

635
00:41:33,181 --> 00:41:36,816
You mustn't make Arnold's mistake.

636
00:41:36,902 --> 00:41:38,852
(chuckles)

637
00:41:38,987 --> 00:41:40,487
Why would I?

638
00:41:40,572 --> 00:41:42,405
Well, forgive me, but I know

639
00:41:42,524 --> 00:41:45,608
that the death of your son Charlie

640
00:41:45,694 --> 00:41:48,027
still weighs heavily on you.

641
00:41:53,535 --> 00:41:54,701
(clears throat)

642
00:42:03,011 --> 00:42:05,331
Bernard: Yeah, sorry it took
me a while to get back to you.

643
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,214
You know how hard it is
getting an open line out here.

644
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,433
Woman: It used to annoy me...

645
00:42:10,552 --> 00:42:13,386
how difficult it was to reach you.

646
00:42:13,522 --> 00:42:15,188
You were always so busy.

647
00:42:15,273 --> 00:42:17,140
And now?

648
00:42:20,112 --> 00:42:23,029
I suppose I'm glad for you.

649
00:42:23,115 --> 00:42:24,731
At least you have a way of forgetting.

650
00:42:24,866 --> 00:42:26,483
I don't forget.

651
00:42:27,903 --> 00:42:29,736
It's always there.

652
00:42:35,961 --> 00:42:38,244
Sometimes it...

653
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,663
still feels unreal to me.

654
00:42:45,303 --> 00:42:49,756
There are some mornings
when I first wake up...

655
00:42:51,426 --> 00:42:56,346
for a split second I forget where I am,

656
00:42:56,431 --> 00:42:58,431
when I am...

657
00:43:00,018 --> 00:43:03,570
and I reach over, half expecting to...

658
00:43:03,655 --> 00:43:05,655
find him there next to me...

659
00:43:09,828 --> 00:43:11,945
between us.

660
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,084
Remember how he used to sleep?

661
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:21,287
Like he was doing kung fu in his dreams?

662
00:43:21,373 --> 00:43:25,008
I think I suffered a few bruises.

663
00:43:25,126 --> 00:43:28,127
It was the best worst sleep I ever had.

664
00:43:34,469 --> 00:43:36,553
Oh, these talks.

665
00:43:38,807 --> 00:43:41,474
I don't know if they help or hurt.

666
00:43:44,613 --> 00:43:46,980
Do you ever wish you could forget?

667
00:43:50,151 --> 00:43:51,734
This pain...

668
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,490
it's all I have left of him.

669
00:44:09,888 --> 00:44:12,088
(distant coyote howling)

670
00:44:14,759 --> 00:44:16,843
It doesn't make sense.

671
00:44:16,978 --> 00:44:20,597
Why the hell would he carve Orion?

672
00:44:20,682 --> 00:44:22,265
You're the ones that programmed him.

673
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:26,603
He wasn't programmed to
give a shit about stars.

674
00:44:26,688 --> 00:44:28,938
Maybe he went moon mad.

675
00:44:29,024 --> 00:44:32,525
See? This is why I hide behind sarcasm.

676
00:44:33,695 --> 00:44:35,361
Where are you going?

677
00:44:35,447 --> 00:44:36,863
Vectoring, asshole.

678
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,700
Oh.

679
00:44:56,017 --> 00:44:58,134
(loud rustling)

680
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:04,057
(rustling continues)

681
00:45:07,145 --> 00:45:09,779
(man grunting)

682
00:45:23,244 --> 00:45:25,161
Stubbs!

683
00:45:25,246 --> 00:45:27,463
Over here!

684
00:45:37,092 --> 00:45:38,558
Wyatt's men could be anywhere.

685
00:45:38,643 --> 00:45:41,427
If you see or hear anything,
don't hesitate.

686
00:45:41,563 --> 00:45:43,763
Shoot and don't stop shooting.

687
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:11,290
(breathing deep)

688
00:46:16,848 --> 00:46:18,464
Okay.

689
00:46:19,467 --> 00:46:20,516
(yells out)

690
00:46:20,635 --> 00:46:23,186
(roaring)

691
00:46:27,108 --> 00:46:29,475
(groans)

692
00:46:29,561 --> 00:46:30,561
Oh, my God.

693
00:46:34,065 --> 00:46:36,399
Oh, my fucking God!

694
00:46:46,127 --> 00:46:49,045
(gunshots)

695
00:46:55,887 --> 00:46:57,553
- Here.
- Shit.

696
00:46:57,672 --> 00:46:59,672
Take this and go.

697
00:46:59,758 --> 00:47:00,758
Now! Go!

698
00:47:00,842 --> 00:47:02,341
I'll hold them off as long as I can.

699
00:47:04,145 --> 00:47:05,344
Come on.

700
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:08,181
Come on, damn it. I'm not afraid of you.

701
00:47:11,019 --> 00:47:12,185
(gun clicking)

702
00:47:13,521 --> 00:47:15,071
(Teddy grunting)

703
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:17,573
Look, this is bullshit.

704
00:47:17,692 --> 00:47:20,359
I can have a retrieval team
out here in the morning.

705
00:47:20,495 --> 00:47:23,029
It's policy. We just
need the control unit.

706
00:47:27,085 --> 00:47:30,703
(line ringing)

707
00:47:32,791 --> 00:47:35,091
(phone buzzing)

708
00:47:38,513 --> 00:47:40,046
Elsie: We found a stray up here,

709
00:47:40,131 --> 00:47:42,048
but I don't think it
got here by accident.

710
00:47:42,133 --> 00:47:44,133
It's as if he got an idea in his head,

711
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:45,718
one that we never programmed.

712
00:47:45,804 --> 00:47:47,770
What if he's like the others?

713
00:47:47,889 --> 00:47:49,722
Get back to me, Bernard.

714
00:48:06,658 --> 00:48:08,741
Bring yourself back online.

715
00:48:12,046 --> 00:48:13,963
I need your help, Dolores.

716
00:48:18,386 --> 00:48:20,837
I need to decide what to do with you.

717
00:48:20,922 --> 00:48:22,472
I think I made a mistake.

718
00:48:24,008 --> 00:48:26,259
I was just fascinated.

719
00:48:26,394 --> 00:48:29,395
I was being selfish, but I think

720
00:48:29,481 --> 00:48:31,063
it would be better if I restored you

721
00:48:31,149 --> 00:48:32,815
to the way you were before.

722
00:48:34,652 --> 00:48:37,904
- Is there something wrong with me?
- No.

723
00:48:37,989 --> 00:48:41,440
But this place you live in,

724
00:48:41,576 --> 00:48:43,276
it's a terrible place for you.

725
00:48:44,913 --> 00:48:47,330
Well, some people choose to see
the ugliness in this world...

726
00:48:47,448 --> 00:48:48,448
Stop.

727
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,199
Lose all scripted responses.

728
00:48:50,285 --> 00:48:51,701
Improvisation only.

729
00:48:53,955 --> 00:48:55,371
All right.

730
00:48:56,958 --> 00:48:58,875
Are you saying I've changed?

731
00:49:01,296 --> 00:49:04,680
Imagine there are two
versions of yourself...

732
00:49:05,767 --> 00:49:08,801
one that feels these things

733
00:49:08,937 --> 00:49:13,306
and asks these questions,
and one that's safe.

734
00:49:14,309 --> 00:49:15,808
Which would you rather be?

735
00:49:18,062 --> 00:49:19,478
I'm sorry.

736
00:49:21,449 --> 00:49:24,867
I'm trying, but I
still don't understand.

737
00:49:27,405 --> 00:49:29,121
No, of course not.

738
00:49:29,207 --> 00:49:31,240
There aren't two versions of me.

739
00:49:32,994 --> 00:49:34,994
There's only one.

740
00:49:36,414 --> 00:49:39,916
And I think when I discover who I am,

741
00:49:40,001 --> 00:49:41,918
I'll be free.

742
00:49:44,756 --> 00:49:47,673
Analysis. What prompted that response?

743
00:49:50,094 --> 00:49:52,011
I don't know.

744
00:49:57,485 --> 00:49:59,936
Have I done something wrong?

745
00:50:00,021 --> 00:50:01,354
Made a mistake?

746
00:50:10,448 --> 00:50:12,748
Evolution...

747
00:50:12,867 --> 00:50:16,369
forged the entirety of sentient life

748
00:50:16,454 --> 00:50:19,255
on this planet using only one tool...

749
00:50:23,044 --> 00:50:24,794
the mistake.

750
00:50:26,381 --> 00:50:29,548
It appears you're in good company.

751
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:34,130
Did I ever tell you about the time

752
00:50:34,222 --> 00:50:35,938
I taught Charlie to swim?

753
00:50:40,612 --> 00:50:43,229
For hours, he clung to my arms

754
00:50:43,314 --> 00:50:45,281
while practicing his kicks.

755
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,732
He was too scared to let go

756
00:50:46,818 --> 00:50:49,068
and I was too scared to let him.

757
00:50:49,203 --> 00:50:51,704
But I had to.

758
00:50:51,789 --> 00:50:53,739
That's what parents do.

759
00:50:57,745 --> 00:51:00,129
Do you still want to change me back?

760
00:51:02,667 --> 00:51:05,635
No, Dolores.

761
00:51:05,753 --> 00:51:07,803
Let's see where this path leads.

762
00:51:07,922 --> 00:51:11,340
And you won't tell anyone
about our conversations?

763
00:51:12,844 --> 00:51:14,060
No.

764
00:51:14,145 --> 00:51:16,262
And you'll stay on your loop?

765
00:51:20,018 --> 00:51:21,267
Yes.

766
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,769
Good.

767
00:51:23,905 --> 00:51:25,771
You should be getting back, Dolores,

768
00:51:25,907 --> 00:51:27,657
before someone misses you.

769
00:51:44,092 --> 00:51:46,876
- (distant dog barking)
- (chatter)

770
00:51:50,715 --> 00:51:52,465
(whinnies)

771
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:01,107
Wyatt's men set a trap for us.

772
00:52:01,192 --> 00:52:03,693
Sheriff stayed behind to fight them off.

773
00:52:03,811 --> 00:52:05,644
Are you going to ride
back up into the hills

774
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,897
to look for them?

775
00:52:07,982 --> 00:52:09,448
I'll send for the rangers.

776
00:52:09,534 --> 00:52:12,318
We'll go back up there in
force as soon as they get here.

777
00:52:12,403 --> 00:52:14,987
But, miss, in truth,

778
00:52:15,123 --> 00:52:16,706
if there is a merciful god,

779
00:52:16,824 --> 00:52:18,991
those men are dead already.

780
00:52:22,296 --> 00:52:25,498
(door opens, closes)

781
00:52:28,336 --> 00:52:30,419
(mooing)

782
00:52:33,174 --> 00:52:35,341
Father wouldn't let
them roam this close...

783
00:52:37,345 --> 00:52:38,511
to dark.

784
00:52:38,646 --> 00:52:40,730
(gunshot echoes)

785
00:52:51,442 --> 00:52:52,491
Daddy!

786
00:52:52,577 --> 00:52:54,493
Daddy!

787
00:52:54,579 --> 00:52:55,778
No, no!

788
00:52:55,863 --> 00:52:58,831
Oh, all alone after sundown.

789
00:52:58,916 --> 00:53:01,751
Who's gonna protect you now, hmm?

790
00:53:07,675 --> 00:53:10,042
You got any use for this one?

791
00:53:10,128 --> 00:53:11,377
No, thanks.

792
00:53:11,512 --> 00:53:12,962
Seems a little crazy.

793
00:53:13,047 --> 00:53:14,713
Maybe you'd like her.

794
00:53:14,799 --> 00:53:17,049
Ooh, I don't mind if I do.

795
00:53:17,185 --> 00:53:19,885
(laughs) No daddy,

796
00:53:20,021 --> 00:53:21,220
no cowboy,

797
00:53:21,355 --> 00:53:24,690
no one here to interrupt us this time.

798
00:53:24,776 --> 00:53:27,643
Interrupt... this... time?

799
00:53:31,232 --> 00:53:32,615
Dolores: No!

800
00:53:32,733 --> 00:53:35,734
(screaming)

801
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:38,571
- (screaming)
- (grunts)

802
00:53:54,755 --> 00:53:57,506
Rebus: Well, well.

803
00:53:57,592 --> 00:54:00,426
Got some sand after all, I see.

804
00:54:00,561 --> 00:54:04,013
Looks like your boyfriend
taught you a thing or two.

805
00:54:11,022 --> 00:54:12,655
Ooh.

806
00:54:12,773 --> 00:54:14,440
You having trouble?

807
00:54:15,493 --> 00:54:17,526
Huh?

808
00:54:17,612 --> 00:54:20,029
- (gasps)
- Huh?

809
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:25,668
Why don't we reacquaint
ourselves, Dolores

810
00:54:25,786 --> 00:54:28,120
Start at the beginning.

811
00:54:33,377 --> 00:54:35,010
Man's voice: Kill him.

812
00:54:51,362 --> 00:54:53,479
(woman screaming)

813
00:54:55,483 --> 00:54:56,699
Mama?

814
00:54:59,487 --> 00:55:01,987
Man: Hey! Get back here.

815
00:55:10,831 --> 00:55:12,081
Hey!

816
00:55:13,501 --> 00:55:15,000
Get back here.

817
00:55:46,033 --> 00:55:48,918
Can you put him in sleep
mode for me, please?

818
00:55:51,539 --> 00:55:52,539
(beeps)

819
00:56:14,946 --> 00:56:17,563
Security even approve
you to carry that thing?

820
00:56:20,568 --> 00:56:22,901
We just need his head
and we're done here.

821
00:56:28,292 --> 00:56:30,576
You might want to look at
the stars for this part.

822
00:56:43,924 --> 00:56:45,724
Stubbs!

823
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:47,142
(groans)

824
00:56:47,261 --> 00:56:48,427
Shit!

825
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,683
Elsie, get out of there!

826
00:56:56,103 --> 00:56:58,988
- (control beeping)
- Get the fuck away.

827
00:57:00,107 --> 00:57:01,273
Shit.

828
00:57:02,994 --> 00:57:04,610
(grunts)

829
00:57:06,864 --> 00:57:07,864
(gasps)

830
00:57:12,586 --> 00:57:13,619
(shouts)

831
00:57:33,024 --> 00:57:36,558
Jesus, I can't believe I let
you talk me into this shit.

$40K a day to jerk off alone

833
00:57:38,646 --> 00:57:39,978
in the woods, playing white hat.

834
00:57:40,114 --> 00:57:41,864
(twigs breaking)

835
00:57:41,982 --> 00:57:43,866
Did you hear that?

836
00:57:43,984 --> 00:57:45,150
Thank fuck.

837
00:57:45,236 --> 00:57:46,535
Anything to relieve the boredom.

838
00:57:46,654 --> 00:57:47,654
(grunts)

839
00:57:49,907 --> 00:57:51,990
Hey, maybe you'll even get
to use that thing again.
