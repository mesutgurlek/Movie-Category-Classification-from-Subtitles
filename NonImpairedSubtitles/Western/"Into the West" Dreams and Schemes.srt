American River

4
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,400
Looks good on the back of a horse.

5
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,200
It's the indian in him.

6
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,400
You should not have
traded cows for the pony.

7
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,800
We have so little.

8
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,600
Well, we'll get by.

9
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:36,200
Don't worry.

10
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,800
Look at him.

11
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,600
Ma, did you see me?

12
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
My son has his father's spirit.

13
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,100
Too much, I think.

14
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,500
"The mohican now found an opportunity to
make a powerful thrust with his knife."

15
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,200
"Magua suddenly relinquished his grasp "

16
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:08,600
and fell backward without motion
and seemingly without life."

17
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,200
Now go to bed.

18
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,300
Just a little more?

19
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,100
It's late.

20
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,000
Please, uncle jethro?

21
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,000
All right, a little more.

22
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,200
"Well done for the delawares."

23
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,500
"Victory to the mohicans", cried hawkeye.

24
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,100
Once more elevating the butt
of the long and fatal rifle.

25
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,500
It's time to teach them to read.

26
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,100
They like the telling.

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,100
It was the same when I was a girl and
we listened to grandfather's stories.

28
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,100
They're sure curious, like their father.

29
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,000
Jacob was always thirsting
after something new.

30
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,500
He loved this book.

31
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,200
It is good you tell them book stories.

32
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,000
It's time I bought 'em some new ones.

33
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Afternoon.

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,900
Afternoon.

35
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,400
I'm sure hopin' you folks can steer
me in the direction of the digs.

36
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,400
I seem to have got myself plumb lost.

37
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,600
Digs?

38
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,700
Ain't you heard?

39
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,200
San francisco's gone crazy.

40
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,433
Fella up there's showin'
off gold from sutter's

41
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:18,300
mill right up here on the american river.

42
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,100
Gold?

43
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,500
Somebody's joshin' you.

44
00:04:20,535 --> 00:04:21,400
No, it's the truth, mister.

45
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:22,500
You must be hungry.

46
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,365
Stay. Eat supper with us.

47
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,500
Thank you kindly, ma'am,
but I best be on my way.

48
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,200
There'll be plenty more on
my tail, I can tell you that.

49
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,400
It'll be picked clean in no time.

50
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,700
Could it be true?

51
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,100
Maybe.

52
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,000
San Francisco

53
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,900
Excuse me, I'm here to see Mr. Matthers

54
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,300
I've heard nothin', margaret.

55
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,300
Damn it, man, did you hire me a team?

56
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:13,600
You simmer down.

57
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,800
Is there no one who's met
a virginia wheelwright?

58
00:05:15,835 --> 00:05:17,565
No men who served with fremont?

59
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,500
I ask everyone who comes through,
margaret, just like I told you I would.

60
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,300
Hands off! That wagon's mine!

61
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,300
You're wasting my time, girl, and yours.

62
00:05:25,335 --> 00:05:26,000
Best let it go.

63
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:27,000
I can'T.

64
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,500
It's my father.

Upper Klamath Lake
Oregon Territory

66
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,200
Captain, these aren't the
indians that killed your men.

67
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,900
Those are modoc people, these are klamath.

68
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,700
Stand away from that prisoner, mr. Wheeler.

69
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,000
This chastisement will serve as
fair warning to all renegade tribes.

70
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,900
I joined the army to open up new lands,

71
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,500
but by opening them, we
had changed them forever.

72
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,400
I'd had my bellyful of soldiering
and paid too high a price for it,

73
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,600
in my heart and in my soul.

74
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
My family, or so I thought then,

75
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,100
was forever lost to me.

76
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,565
Jethro had taken my place,

77
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,200
and they had lived in their rightful peace.

78
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,369
Once I had found that peace myself in the

79
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,500
solitude of the mountains
and hoped I would again.

80
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,200
I don't know.

81
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,500
I think I heard someone say
they were looking for gold.

82
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,300
Really?

83
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,100
Prospector: What's that?

84
00:07:42,135 --> 00:07:43,000
What is that?

85
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,100
Jake.

86
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:24,800
Jake.

87
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,300
Jake.

88
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Jake, hey, look!

89
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
All right, all right!

90
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,000
10...

91
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,500
20...

92
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,600
25...

93
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,900
don't pass me by so easily, friend.

94
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
For only a fraction of an ounce of gold,

95
00:08:59,235 --> 00:09:01,200
yours can be the secret of vitality.

96
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,200
Fancy a poke?

97
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,100
Sorry?

98
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,900
Only $5.00.Worth every penny.

99
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,000
Decided to try your hand?

100
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,900
Yeah, maybe.

101
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,000
Some here's made enough
for 2 lifetimes already.

102
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,500

106
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,000
$397.17.

107
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,900
Just like that.

108
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,600
I'll be wishing you luck, jethro.

109
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:34,800
You just...

110
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,000
pulled that out of the water?

111
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,000
Think on the lord's word, brothers.

112
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,300
What shall it profit a
man to gain the world,

113
00:09:40,335 --> 00:09:42,100
but lose his own soul?

114
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,600
Move along, preacher.

115
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,700
Take your doxology work someplace else.

116
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,100
You're scarin' away all the gold.

117
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,965
You, brother, turn back now.

118
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,900
Turn back before the wages of
sin exact their fearful toll.

119
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,500
It's none of my business, reverend, but...

120
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,500
if the good lord didn't want a man to profit
from all those rocks he put in the ground,

121
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:02,500
why'd he put 'em there?

You ask me 'cause I know everybody.

Step aside, sir, please.

I have business with your officer.

Well,

144
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,100
listen to that, huh?

This little gal's got business, huh?

146
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,700
Back to your work, private.

147
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,800
Can I help you, miss?

148
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,000
Are there any men here who
served with captain fremont?

Muleskinner?

Yes, ma'am.

159
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,500
Now, I'll do for you,

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,500
No.

00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,800
Please...

164
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,600
It's all right.

00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,500
It's all right.

You have to listen to me.

168
00:14:33,235 --> 00:14:34,100
You have to leave here.

169
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,000
You have to leave here immediately.

You have to trust me.

171

You must leave.

00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,300
This one appears to be in your size.

173
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,700
It's too pretty.

Thank you, mr. Biggs.

You're very kind.

00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,200
You must allow me to make
your portrait sometime.

I couldn'T.

183

Oh, I think you could.

It's not very big.

185
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,900
If you knew what you were talking about
you'd know that's probably worth about $30.

186
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,800
You have found more of this?

187
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,600
Not yet, but I will.

188
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,600
Can I hold it?

189
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,500
Sure you can.

190
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,000
You've never seen anything like it.

191
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,400
Hundreds of them in the river pulling
out a fortune without even trying.

192
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,300
It's nature's bounty, and it's
right there for the taking.

193
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,700
It cannot be so easy.

194
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,600
I'm telling you it's just sitting
there in the water waiting to be found,

195
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,500
and I'm, by god, gonna find it.

No, no, a man can always do better,

and that's just what I mean to do.

200

You could fix wheels again.

201
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,600
I'm no wheelwright, and neither was jacob.

202

You know that.

203
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,300
Your brother would not
care about such things.

204
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,400
Hell, he could be in the middle of some
stream right now making his fortune.

205
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,900
He sure ain't here.

It will be cold tonight.

207

Please bring in the wood.

208

not gonna want for anything.

You gotta get yourself one of these.

00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:40,900
This is my claim!

333
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,700
This is my claim!

334
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,900
Well, it's mine now!

335
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,100
You've had your turn!

336
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,165
Go on now!

337
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,700
Go back to the boat!

338
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,000
You've had your turn!

339
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Go back!

340
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,600
It's my claim now!

341
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,465
Sons of bitches.

342
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
They won't be coming back.

343
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,400
It's my claim now.

344
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,200
Hey, can you spare some
dust so I can get a drink?

345
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,200
Jarrett?

346
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,700
What happened to you?

347
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,700
Just down on my luck.

348
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,100
It'll turn.

349
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,100
I thought you headed up river.

350
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,000
I did, just didn't tap in.

351
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,100
Could you stake me for a drink?

352
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,100
Heh! I'll pay you back when I hit it.

353
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,600
I dreamed a dream the other night

354
00:30:56,635 --> 00:30:58,117
that everything was still

355
00:30:58,152 --> 00:30:59,726
I dreamed that I was carrying

356
00:30:59,761 --> 00:31:01,300
my laundry on down the hill

357
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,200
a piece slipped out and I fell down

358
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,800
now I drag my liver

359
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,800
oh, I'll wash my long johns

360
00:31:06,835 --> 00:31:08,800
in the icy river ....

361
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,100
hey, jethro.

362
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,000
What?

363
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,700
Come here.

364
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:13,800
ok

365
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,500
We're rich.

366
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,300
We're rich.

367
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,300
We're stinking--

368
00:31:31,335 --> 00:31:32,000
shut up!

369
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,900
You want 'em to kill us?

370
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,600
Get your coat quick!

371
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,700
Get my coat off.

372
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,400
Come on.

373
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,100
Come on!

374
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,000
Is it real?

375
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,700
Will you look at that.

376
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,000
How much gold do you think's there?

377
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,300
It's a big vein.

378
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
I'd say a quarter, maybe a third.

379
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:17,600
Maybe a half?

380
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,100
You must take it from here quickly.

381
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,400
We've gotta get this assayed.

382
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,000
The river's up.

383
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,300
We'll go downstream to sacramento.

384
00:32:25,335 --> 00:32:26,300
There's banks there.

385
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,400
We'll set out at dawn.

386
00:32:27,435 --> 00:32:28,200
We gotta move fast.

387
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,452
We'll take jake with us to cover
our backs until we reach the river.

388
00:32:30,487 --> 00:32:30,700
No

389
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,400
he is a boy.

390
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,600
Well, he's old enough to
make sure we keep what's ours.

391
00:32:34,635 --> 00:32:35,265
This is not his doing.

392
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,500
Do not make him part of it!

393
00:32:36,535 --> 00:32:37,700
You never were for this.

394
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,965
Even now you're not happy about it.

395
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,800
I know I'm not jacob, but I tried to
do my best. No one ever asked you to be!

396
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,700
I've made mistakes.

397
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,465
All right, I've made mistakes.

398
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,500
I know that, but things
are gonna be different now.

399
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,100
All right?

400
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,700
if you were white, you'd know that
having that rock means everything.

401
00:32:52,735 --> 00:32:54,300
It means everything I ever promised you.

402
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,400
Please.

403
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,100
Please give me a chance to prove it.

404
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,500
Please, I'll show you.

405
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,100
Please.

406
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,700
Please.

407
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,800
I will pack food for you.

408
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,500
Thank you.

409
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,445
Think I'll buy me a grand
city house with servants

410
00:33:26,446 --> 00:33:29,500
to wait on me like those
plantations back home.

411
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,500
What about you, jethro?

412
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,700
What are you gonna do with your half?

413
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,900
"Half".

414
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,800
What are you talking about "half?"

415
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,900
That was my claim.

416
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,100
Oh, you'll get your reward,
but you ain't getting half.

417
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,600
I'd say your take is a quarter.

418
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,600
I found it.

419
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,600
Mm-hmm.

420
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,365
I found it!

421
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,200
You owe me half, you son of a bitch!

422
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,300
You being family, I'll make it a third.

423
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Take it or leave it.

424
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,600
Now sit down and have a drink.

425
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,800
I found it.

426
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,900
Jethro: David!

427
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,900
David!

428
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,700
David!

429
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,300
Unh!

430
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,400
Aah!

431
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,500
Let go!

432
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,100
Let...

433
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,100
go!

434
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,700
Argh!

435
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,600
One year later

436
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,797
San Francisco

437
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,000
Ethan: 4...

438
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,300
5...

439
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,600
6...

440
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,500
7...

441
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,800
8...

442
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:10,900
9...

443
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,600
And we're done.

444
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,865
Thank you very much.

445
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,600
My assistant should have this
portrait ready for you momentarily.

446
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,600
Margaret?

447
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,100
I'll just be a moment.

448
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,800
Like this perhaps?

449
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,600
I think so.

450
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,512
I was so young,

451
00:40:33,694 --> 00:40:35,200
but I still see that face sometimes.

452
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,100
Well, we'll get one of these pictures
engraved and post it everywhere.

453
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:42,800
Margaret...

454
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,800
when are you going to
introduce me to your mother?

455
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,300
You're not ashamed of me, are you?

456
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,600
Ashamed?

457
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,400
I mean, after all, I am a foreigner.

458
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,200
That's not it.

459
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,600
Then what?

460
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,000
There are things about me
that you don't know, ethan.

461
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,700
Then tell me.

462
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,200
I'm not pure white.

463
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,900
My mother is lakota.

464
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,400
Out here, none of that matters.

465
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,900
Out here, everyone has a clean slate.

466
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,500
Hey, boy, more coffee.

467
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,200
Yes, sir.

468
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,200
Next.

469
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,600
30 cents.

470
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,300
I want something back.

471
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,500
Ok.

472
00:42:04,178 --> 00:42:05,047
Keep moving.

473
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,400
Please.

474
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,000
Leave her be.

475
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,200
All right.

476
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,600
Just saying hello.

477
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,600
More food.

478
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:15,900
More bread.

479
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,400
Hurry.

480
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,400
Margaret: Mother?

481
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,000
Oh!

482
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,000
I clean the white men's clothes.

483
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,700
I feed those who are hungry.

484
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,700
More and more they come.

485
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,400
They pay me with the gold that
stole away jethro's spirit.

486
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,000
Some I keep to make our lives better.

487
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,500
Some I give back to the
earth as an offering.

488
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,200
Surely you can afford to leave now.

489
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,400
I will never leave this place.

490
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,200
Why not?

491
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,100
The spirits spoke to me in a dream.

492
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,200
They told me that one day your
father would return to this place.

493
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,700
The spirits.

494
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,600
Dreams.

495
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,467
[Speaking lakota language]

496
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,800
[Speaking lakota language]

497
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,300
The ways of our people must
change or they will die.

498
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,200
That is what I have
learned in san francisco.

499
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,200
I see you hold my daughter in your heart,

500
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,200
ethan biggs, but the new
ways are not always better.

501
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,500
No, I make no such claim.

502
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,865
But, yes, it's true.

503
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,500
I do hold your daughter in my heart.

504
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,100
So it is with my own husband.

505
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,100
Even when I was wife to his brother,

506
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,700
I was bound to him alone.

507
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,000
If wakan tanka blesses you with such a bond,

508
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,700
there is nothing that can destroy it.

509
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,900
Those whom god hath joined together,

510

The white father in the
place called washington

513
00:44:26,036 --> 00:44:31,100
sent word that all the nations of the
plains should gather to hear his words.

From all directions,

522
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,765
many nations came to the great smoke to show

523
00:45:10,766 --> 00:45:14,000
their desire to live at
peace with the whites.

524
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,600
The lakota called it the
council at long meadows,

525
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,700
and our friends the cheyenne
called it the horse creek treaty.

526
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:27,500
To the whites, it was the
treaty of fort laramie.

527
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,729
"Article 5: The aforesaid
indian nations "do hereby

528
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:35,800
recognize and acknowledge the
following tracts of country,"

529
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,700
included within the metes and
boundaries hereinafter designated...

530
00:45:39,735 --> 00:45:44,000
the broken hand who
spoke for the white father

531
00:45:44,001 --> 00:45:48,300
divided the earth among the nations
as if he were the creator himself.

532
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,000
He gave each nation land they already owned.

533
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,143
The white father then told the nations
to live in peace with one another

534
00:45:57,988 --> 00:46:01,500
and to allow the wagons of the
whites to pass through without harm.

535
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,100
For that,

536
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,500
he would give us cattle
to eat and fine things,

537
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,400
but for any wrong the people did,

538
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,000
the people would make payment.

Conquering bear, a cow was taken from a
wagon train that passed by this village,

670
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,600
and I demand that you return
this cow and turn over the thief.

They're not gonna give you this man.

688
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,700
They give you something for the cow.

689
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:34,300
Tell them the man who took this
cow will go to the stockade.

690
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,000
He must turn this man over to me now.

He wants to sit and smoke with you.

697
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:58,400
The united states army does
not bargain with thieves.

698
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,000
Ready on those guns.

699
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,600
It's just a cow, lieutenant.

700
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,400
Ready those guns, or I'll have you
in the stockade for insubordination.

701
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,465
Conquering bear, you are
hereby ordered by the U.S.

Army to hand over this cow
thief or suffer the consequences.

705
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:20,800
Will he give me this man?

706
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:22,500
No.

707
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:24,900
[Speaking lakota language]

708
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:47,600
Fire.

709
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:48,200
Sir?

710
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,300
Fire, damn you!

711
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:56,600
Fire!

712
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,700

Old indian: The people's pain was
deep and their anger beyond control.

715
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:27,300
The white man had shown
himself to be without honor.

716
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:31,600
The treaty of long
meadows was to be no more.

717
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,527
The wrath of the white father
in washington rained down

718
01:02:38,562 --> 01:02:42,400
and became a flood that
could not be stopped.

719
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:47,800
Everything seemed to be disappearing
into a great hole in the earth.

720
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,800
The vision of growling
bear was coming to pass.

721
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,700
Loved by the buffalo was afraid.

Jacob: The west is a
place not a way to live.

724
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:11,767
Others would come to these lands seeking
to escape the growing darkness back east,

725
01:03:11,802 --> 01:03:12,951
Lawrence, Kansas Territory

726
01:03:12,986 --> 01:03:14,100
but the shadows would follow them,

727
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,800
as they did uncle benjamin's
son, samson,and his family,

728
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:22,500
the next wheelers to set their wagons
toward the promise of the setting sun.

729
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,100
It's done, pa, just like
you said it would be.

730
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:26,365
Lincoln elected president.

731
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,800
South carolina to secede from the union.

732
01:03:28,835 --> 01:03:31,200
This wheel could use a rim, jeremiah.

733
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:32,200
Yes, sir.

734
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,800
I measured it out for you.

735
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:39,300
Like i was saying, sir, if there's
work, I'm looking to get hired on.

736
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,100
I been pounding iron a long time now.

737
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,600
I even had me my own shop on
the plantation where I was born.

738
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,600
Now, I done fixed wheels, shod horses.

739
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,900
I even turned me some real nice
french quarter banisters, too.

740
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:52,800
Mm-hmm.

741
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,500
I been freed by my master,
and I got papers to prove it.

742
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,650
If it's food you need--

743
01:03:57,685 --> 01:03:58,700
with all due respect, sir,

744
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,600
I'll be working harder
and faster than 2 men,

745
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:02,900
and I don't expect much,

746
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,500
just some place to lay my
head when the day's done.

747
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:08,000
He could have the room at
the back of the shop, pa.

748
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,500
I'll work for nothing till you see
I ain't lying about what I can do.

749
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:15,600
What's your name?

750
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:17,400
Henry.

751
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:18,700
Henry foster, sir.

752
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:23,100
My sons, aaron and jeremiah.

753
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,700
Shake hands, boys.

754
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,141
The lord did not intend for these western

755
01:04:29,142 --> 01:04:31,700
lands to be cursed with
the scourge of slavery.

756
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:36,300
Virginia may be lost, but we must
endeavor to make sure kansas stays free.

757
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,300
Samson wheeler.

758
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:42,900
You'll work for wages.

759
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,500
I won't have it any other way.

760
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:46,000
Yes, sir.

761
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,100
Thank you, sir.

762
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:47,800
Thank you.

763
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,600
All right then, henry, let's get to work.

764
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:52,700
Yes, sir.

765
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:59,500
Mr. Lincoln has made a proposal to span
the country with a telegraph and a railroad.

766
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,500
A most righteous enterprise.

767
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,400
Do you think there will be war?

768
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,500
Men driven to extremes
are capable of anything,

769
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:13,200
but war and hatred only
breed more war and hatred.

770
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:16,300
Things will go hard on our
people back in wheelerton.

771
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:18,850
Well, let those that would
make war look to their

772
01:05:18,851 --> 01:05:21,300
consciences for forgiveness
and love as we have to ours.

773
01:05:21,335 --> 01:05:22,700
Why isn't clara helping you?

774
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,900
Oh, I do hate to pull her from her sewing.

775
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:30,500
The girl will never learn to make a home if
you allow her to avoid her responsibilities.

776
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I believe she is called to
a higher purpose, samson.

777
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:37,259
Someday, women in new orleans or atlanta or

778
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:40,700
perhaps even new york
will be wearing her gowns.

779
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,300
Frivolities.

780
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:45,300
Sheer frivolities.

781
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,300
Come in.

782
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:55,400
Clara, your mother requires
your help for supper.

783
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:57,800
Papa, look at this. Isn't it beautiful?

784
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,400
It isn't done yet, but...

785
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:02,500
do you like it?

786
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,100
It's quite beautiful.

787
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,000
It is, isn't it?

788
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,600
You know, clara,

789
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,900
your mother might appreciate a new dress.

790
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:17,000
For material.

791
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,200
I know just what to buy.

792
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,200
Thank you, papa!

793
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:26,900
I'll make her the best dress in lawrence.

794
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:27,700
Yes, you will.

795
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:33,412
There are those on our
borders who seek to deter us

796
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:37,100
from the great cause
which we have made our own.

797
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:44,300
I speak of the murderous bushwhackers who
refer to themselves as quantrill's raiders!

798
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:51,800
I say to you today we will defend our homes,

799
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,400
and we will defend our beliefs,

800
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:58,671
and we will not shy from blood

801
01:06:59,339 --> 01:07:04,682
until every godless
slave-holding citizen of

802
01:07:04,683 --> 01:07:10,500
missouri is cast into a
burning pit of hellfire!

803
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:24,800
Mr. Lane, why don't you save your guff for
all those blue-bellied yankees back east,

804
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:29,300
you and all your jayhawkin' kansas trash?

805
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:33,571
We're not gonna stand
for you comin' around here

806
01:07:33,572 --> 01:07:36,500
and dictatin' to us with
your nigger worshippin'.

807
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:38,400
You talk about hellfire, mr. Lane?

808
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,900
Well, I reckon we're gonna make things
hot enough around here for ya real soon,

809
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,100
and that is a fact, sir.

810
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,500
I seen your faces, and I'm gonna kill y'all.

811
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,200
I'm gonna murder every last one
of ya, and I'm gonna like it!

812
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:00,700
Hyah!

813
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:14,100
John brown's body lies
a-mouldering in his grave

814
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:19,700
john brown's body lies
a-mouldering in his grave

815
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:25,100
john brown's body lies
a-mouldering in his grave

816
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:29,600
his soul is marching on...

817
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,700
Nevada Territory

818
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:34,500
jacob: The pay was $100 a month,

819
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,000
and the distance was 2,000
miles from st. Joe, missouri

820
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,100
to sacramento, california.

821
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:46,270
The ad read, "wanted: Young,
skinny, wiry fellows not over 18.

822
01:08:46,965 --> 01:08:50,400
"Must be experienced riders
willing to risk their failing.

823
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,100
Orphans preferred.

824
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:54,200
Not many were orphans,

825
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,100
but like my son, abe wheeler,

826
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:59,400
they were all hungry for
freedom and a taste of adventure.

827
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:01,700
And they weren't long finding it.

828
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:08,800
Any sign of indians?

829
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,000
Well, not until just now.

830
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:13,700
Careful.

831
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,600
Abe wheeler here has seen the back of
every station from, what, st.  Louis

832
01:09:17,635 --> 01:09:19,100
clear to sacramento?

833
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,200
And more than once, too.

834
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:20,900
Is that so?

835
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,100
Well, I rode me 60 miles today.

836
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:25,600
How many miles you make?

837
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,500
Of course, I done better.

838
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:36,500
I do my talking in the saddle.

839
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:46,400
Well, you got yourself a race, abe.

840
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:47,900
Yeah!

841
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:02,539
California

842
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:07,954
10 years had passed since I'd
been restored to those I loved.

843
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:11,100
While the country lay
on the verge of disunion,

844
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:14,200
for us that decade was
a time of great healing.

845
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:17,900
Never again would I know
such peace and contentment.

846
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,500
Mother, father, everyone's waiting.

847
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:22,900
Hurry please.

848
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:24,100
Ethan's losing the light.

849
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:34,000
Right, now, mr. Wheeler, could I have you
move a fraction closer to mrs. Wheeler?

850
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,000
And just for the sake
of symmetry, jacob, jr.

851
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:39,800
, Could you please change
places with corn flower?

852
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:42,100
Thank you.

853
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:46,900
All right.

854
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,500
Not a twitch.

855
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,000
And in this time of terrible trial,

856
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:02,240
we ask that you give strength
to mr. Lincoln's soldiers

857
01:12:02,241 --> 01:12:05,400
and keep our son abraham
safe wherever he may be.

858
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:08,300
And bless our lakota family.

859
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:11,200
Bless their wives and bless their children.

860
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:12,600
Amen.

861
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,300
All: Amen.

862
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,300
Let's eat.

863
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:16,600
Potatoes?

864
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:17,300
Certainly.

865
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,300
Now, ethan...

866
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,100
yes, sir.

867
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,200
Tell me the truth.

868
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:25,500
Does margaret treat her man
the same way her mother does me?

869
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,300
Jacob.

870
01:12:26,392 --> 01:12:26,900
No.
It's all right.

871
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Margaret is her mother's daughter
in many respects, mr. Wheeler.

872
01:12:29,035 --> 01:12:31,200
Jacob, pass the potatoes.
Yes, sir.

873
01:12:31,235 --> 01:12:32,100
Yeah, but can she cook?

874
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:36,500
That is a very dangerous question for
me to answer right now, mr. Wheeler.

875
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:37,700
Aren't you eating?

876
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,400
It's time for me to go, pa.

877
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:51,000
There's a war on now, and
california's declared for the union.

878
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,400
It's time I set out on my own.

879
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:05,500
Thought on where you're headed?

880
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:10,000
North, maybe, then east
across the territories.

881
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,700
I'll just let the wind
blow me where it wants to.

882
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:16,700
Well...

883
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:19,600
like you to have my pistol.

884
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:26,800
I'll feel better knowin' you're carrying
a gun that's already done some killin'...

885
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:29,400
and knows what it's about.

886
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,000
Jacob...

887
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:39,900
there are plenty out there who mean
harm, so don't you be afraid to use it.

888
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:42,800
Better that than gettin' killed.

889
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:45,100
You understand me?

890
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:47,100
Yes, sir.

891
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,400
I think it's coming today.

892
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,700
He says it's from new york.

893
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:11,100
Ma'am?

894
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,300
Soldier: Spare a penny?

895
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,000
It's very nice, but no, thank you.

896
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:30,700
Thank you.

897
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:50,800
Man: Quantrill's men did this.

898
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:54,600
All right.

899
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:56,100
Get to work.

900
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:59,700
I reckon I best be movin' on, mr. Wheeler.

901
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:00,400
No.

902
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,900
To give in to such
terror is to admit defeat.

903
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,000
I'll not have any of that kind of talk.

904
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,200
Samson.

905
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,034
Susannah: Such convictions are all well and

906
01:15:24,035 --> 01:15:26,400
good for the boys, but
I worry for clara's sake.

907
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:30,400
At least allow me to send
word to nephew daniel in omaha.

908
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:33,799
I will not have the girl
obliged for her welfare

909
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:37,300
to a man with whom I am
not on friendly terms with,

911
01:15:38,174 --> 01:15:38,987

Great Plains
October, 1861

914
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:01,900
As each year passed, dog
star continued to count.

915
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:05,600
The symbols he drew caused him much pain,

916
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:10,000
but he did not abandon the sacred
trust which had been placed in him.

917
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:16,400
His brother running fox joked that
he saw no difference in the pictures,

01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,500
just more white men every year.

990
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:54,700
I want you and your mama to get out of town,

991
01:24:54,735 --> 01:24:56,500
no matter what you hear,
no matter what you see.

992
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,600
You keep runnin', you promise me?

01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:10,900
Ohh!

Yah, yah!

You and your mother get goin'.

I'll come for you when it's over.

1002
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:29,300

Go on, now.

1006
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:34,700
Git!

1007
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:35,300
Go on!

1008
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:47,300
Man: They're in the barn!

1009
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:50,700
Hurry, mama!

1011
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:55,900
Listen to me and do as I say.

1012
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:58,200
If anything should happen,

1013
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:02,800
I want you to make your way
to cousin daniel in omaha.

1014
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:04,300
He'll take good care of you.

1015
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:05,500
Mama!

1016
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:07,700
All right?

1017
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:08,600
Mama!

1018
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:09,500
All right, now, go.

1019
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:10,765
No!

1020
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:11,700
Clara, go.

1021
01:26:11,735 --> 01:26:12,367
Mama!

1022
01:26:12,402 --> 01:26:13,000
Go!

1023
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:14,100
Run!

1024
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:16,400
Run!

1025
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,100
Burn every house!

1026
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:42,200
Kill every man!

1027
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,200
Kansas must be cleansed,

1028
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,700
and the only way to cleanse it is to kill!

1029
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,900
Aah!

1030
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:51,800
Man: Get over here, right now!

1031
01:26:56,818 --> 01:26:58,641
You three check those houses!

1032
01:26:58,957 --> 01:27:00,503
You three get the church!

1033
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:04,000
If you have to fire, stagger your shots.

1034
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:05,700
Give yourself time to reload.

1035
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:29,500
Go!

1036
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:40,100
Samson!

1037
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:41,500
Susannah?

1038
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:54,600
Papa, no!

1039
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:56,300
Ohh!

1040
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,200
No, no! Aah!

1041
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:58,800
no!

1042
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:59,300
Jacob: Too many found the ravages
of the west to be unendurable.

1043
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:04,900
Yet there were countless others who called
on a courage they never knew they possessed.

1044
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:09,600
Clara wheeler was one of these rare spirits.

1045
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:12,900
She would survive.

1046
