00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,269
I'’LL HELP WITH
THE CIDER PRESSING.

7
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:38,608
( groaning )

8
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:57,544
OUR SOUL IS
BOWED DOWN TO THE DUST.

9
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,665
TELL JOHNNY TO BREW SOME COFFEE,
OPEN SOME PEACHES.

10
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:01,024
- AL KNEW THEY WAS COMIN'’.
- WELL, HE KNEW SOMETHIN'’

11
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,917
I'’D ABOUT DECIDED HE JUST
COULDN'’T SLEEP WITHOUT TRIXIE.

12
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,799
AM I RIGHT IN BELIEVING
THAT I SAW YOU LAST YEAR
IN THE HILLS?

13
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,069
HE AND HIS MEN WOULD REQUIRE
SOME RESUPPLY AND RESPITE.

14
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,886
I'’LL MAKE YOUR FEELINGS KNOWN
TO THE OTHER OPERATORS.

15
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:11,260
I AND MY FELLOW OFFICERS
WOULD BE GRATEFUL NOW
FOR THE USE OF THE BATHHOUSE.

16
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:16,265
MR. BURNS HERE
WILL STEER YOU.

17
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:25,274
THE CAMP WILL
WANT A PARADE.

18
00:05:29,278 --> 00:05:32,498
A PARADE IS ALL RIGHT.

19
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:42,008
UNLESS YOU WANT A GIRL
TO SPONGE YOU WHILE
WE CONVERSE?

20
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:30,056
THOSE ARE THE DAYS
TO MY FUCKING LEFT.

21
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,574
IT CAN'’T BE DONE.

22
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,013
YOUR MOST VICTORIOUS
SMILE.

23
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:07,019
I HOPE YOU

FOR YOUR SERVICE.

24
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:19,866
HI, DOC.

25
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:27,373
THE FUCKIN'’ MAGISTRATE DON'’T

00:08:47,977 --> 00:08:49,312
LETTUCE.

29
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,745
ALL RIGHT.

30
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,137
I MAKE THIS STIPULATION.

31
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:31,020
OF YOUR FUCKING BOOT.

32
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,479
( whispers )
ALL RIGHT.

33
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,879
HERE'’S YOUR GODDAMN BOOT.

00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,386
HELP ME PUT IT ON.

35
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,676
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

36
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:45,287
OH, FUCK YOU, AL!

37
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,663
I'’LL SEND SOMEONE OVER
TO PICK HIM UP.

38
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,893
I MADE JEWEL
A BRACE AND A BOOT.

39
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:22,525
I'’M WORKING ON MY DEPLOYMENTS
AND FLANKING MANEUVERS.

40
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,663
HOW ABOUT THAT OTHER ONE?

41
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,450
TRIXIE'’S FINE.

42
00:12:52,388 --> 00:12:53,856
TRIXIE?

43
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,814
ARE TRYING
TO WASH OUR SHIRTS
IN GODDAMN FECES!

44
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:46,775
IT DEMANDS CAPITAL.
( chuckles )

45
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,472
GENERATING FROM THE INTEREST
ON THE PREVIOUS DEBTS?

46
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,393
ALMA...

47
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,518
YOUR SPIRIT TO UNDERSTAND
IS ALWAYS PAINFUL FOR ME.

48
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:10,859
AFTER YOU GOT ME OUT OF DEBT,
I GOT MYSELF BACK IN.

49
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,031
.
MY DAUGHTER BECOMING
A GARRET RAISED ME IN
THE LENDER'’S ESTIMATION

50
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,456
AND CONSIDERABLY MORE.

51
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,294
ALL RIGHT, DADDY.

52
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,392
I'’LL HAVE THAT IN WRITING
BEFORE I HELP YOU.

53
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,934
AND YOU'’LL
HAVE NO SUCH THING.

54
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,110
GET AWAY FROM HER!

55
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:44,620
WHY, THANK YOU, SIR.

56
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:48,841
( sobbing )

57
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:58,767
PLUS $2 SOME-ODD
FOR MRS. GARRET TO GIVE
THAT GIRL.

58
00:17:07,476 --> 00:17:09,478
( sobbing )

59
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,952
I'’LL GIVE HER
THE MONEY LATER.

60
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,045
SETH.

61
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:54,857
.
I'’M ASKING FOR YOUR HELP

62
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:13,041
THEY LOVE--
TO HAVE THEIR
PICTURES TAKEN.

63
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,519

AT THE STORE?

64
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:47,409
AND BILKING YOU LOSE,
NEEDING TO RUB AGAINST
YOUR BETTERS.

65

00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:20,275
AND WIDEN SUSPICION

68
00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:33,288
I KNOW WHAT'’S
IN THE TILL.

69
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:40,762
WERE YOU BULLIED, MR. BULLOCK,
WHEN YOUNG AND INCAPABLE?

70
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,733
MY OLFACTORIES ARE KEEN

71
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,462
AS TO HER COMPLICITY
IN HER HUSBAND'’S MURDER...

72
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,266
I SUPPOSE YOU'’D BEST

73
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,936
GENTLEMEN,

82
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,724
AT ONCE ATTACKED
FROM ALL FOUR SIDES.

83

THE FUCKING BADGE.

89
00:25:59,174 --> 00:26:01,176
NOT CERTAIN I TAKE
YOUR INFERENCE.

90
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:05,146
.
AND IF I DO,
I'’M NOT SURE I LIKE IT

91
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:15,190
LEAVE IT THERE,
YOU BOUGHT-OUT
SON OF A BITCH.

00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,580
BUT, OF COURSE, YOU'’RE
BUYING FOR FULL-GROWN MEN.

95
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,935
I DON'’T THINK
I KILLED HIM.

96
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,532
NOW, THAT'’S THE MESSAGE
YOU WANT ME TO TAKE UPSTAIRS.

97
00:29:13,868 --> 00:29:17,288
YOU OUGHT TO PIN THAT
ON YOUR CHEST.

98
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,762
YOU JUST TELL HIM.

99
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,109
OR TO MAKE
YOUR FUCKING WAY?!

YOU WISH YOU
COULD AMEND, SETH.

102
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,533
WHAT KIND OF A MAN
HAVE I BECOME, SOL?

103
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,536
I DON'’T KNOW.

104
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,540
THE DAY AIN'’T
FUCKING OVER.

105
00:32:06,374 --> 00:32:08,293
DID I SAY
SOMETHING FUNNY?

106
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:22,223
THAT COCKSUCKER
CLAGETT'’S BAGMAN.

WHY ARE YOU HERE,
MR. BULLOCK?

115

116
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:02,350
AND THE CAMP SHERIFF CAN BE
BOUGHT OFF FOR HALF A CAN
OF BACON GREASE.

117

MAY I HAVE
A WORD, GENERAL?

118
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,006
WE ALL HAVE
BLOODY THOUGHTS.

119
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,935
I QUITE
UNDERSTAND.

120

IF I WERE SHERIFF,
I'’D HAVE YOU HANGED

SEEMS HE WILL.

124
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:17,902
MR. BULLOCK WAS

00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:55,773
TILL HE SOLD ME
TO CY TOLLIVER.

YOU GO WITH MISS STUBBS
FOR DINNER, OKAY?

131
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,782
I'’VE ASKED GENERAL CROOK
TO SEE TO HIS SAFETY.

132
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:38,242
WE'’LL DEAL
WITH THAT THEN.

133
00:39:57,511 --> 00:39:59,980
MARRIED.

134
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,734
YES.

135
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:31,295
IF YOU'’D-- IF YOU WOULD BE
MORE COMFORTABLE BEHIND
THE SCREEN...

136
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:38,636
( whispers )
WOULDN'’T THAT
DEFEAT OUR PURPOSE?

137
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:22,680
( sighs )

138
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:11,896
GIVE YOU TIME
TO MAKE UP WHICH SIDE
YOU'’RE ON, ADAMS.

139
00:42:15,316 --> 00:42:18,319
IF THE COCKSUCKER
WOULD EVER SHOW UP.

140
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:39,640
FOR THAT WHICH I DO,
I ALLOW NOT FOR...

141
00:43:00,527 --> 00:43:03,998
BUT SIN THAT
DWELLETH IN ME.

142
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:13,457
SHUT THE DOOR.

JESUS CHRIST.

144

TO KNOW YOUR-YOUR--
YOUR OMNIPOTENCE?

145
00:44:33,954 --> 00:44:37,424
IT HURTS SO BAD."

148
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,889
DEAL OUT DEATH

150

( choking gasp )

151
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,169

00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:57,824
- WHICH HE'’D BE...
- Al: WHEREVER HIS
ALLEGIANCE MAY LAY.

159
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,303
LIVING AS WE ALL DO
IN DOUBT, PLEASE PROCEED.

160
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,442
WILL NO LONGER
WEIGH UPON YOU.

161
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:10,230
WHAT MAN COULDN'’T
THAT BE SAID ABOUT?

162
00:49:11,732 --> 00:49:14,234
( gagging )

163
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,155
- ( blade slices )
- ( groans )

164
00:49:34,921 --> 00:49:36,890
WHEN YOU TAKE THAT 
FUCKING GUN OFF ME.

165
00:49:44,431 --> 00:49:46,233
BOTH OF THEM.

166
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,198

-( gunshots )
-( bugle playing )

168
00:50:40,654 --> 00:50:43,573
I DON'’T BEGRUDGE HIM
AN UNCOMFORTABLE JOURNEY.

169
00:50:50,163 --> 00:50:52,049
AND AFTER THAT,
HE'’S ON HIS OWN.

170
00:51:05,846 --> 00:51:09,349
OR IS THAT ONE OF
YOUR FUCKING HERESIES?

171
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:18,191
HE PASSED.

172
00:51:26,533 --> 00:51:29,536
WAITED TILL I GOT HIM
OFF THE SLED, HUH?

173
00:51:35,041 --> 00:51:37,043
THANKS FOR
SEEING HIM THROUGH.

174
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:56,696
IS A GOOD WAY TO HEAR
GOD LAUGH.

175
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:13,046
( thumps )

176
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,907
IT'’S BEEN
A BUSY NIGHT.

177
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:56,423
DOC, I'’M GONNA BE 
A FEW MINUTES, HUH?

178
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,926

HIS SHINE, HUH?

179
00:53:08,635 --> 00:53:10,637
NO STIFFNESS
OR NUMBNESS.

180
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,358
UH, LET ME SEE YOU
MOVE AROUND A BIT.

181
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,367
THAT'’LL GIVE YOU
A SHINE.

182
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:38,465
HEY, DOC.
GIVE ME A WHIRL.

183
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:47,891

185
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:16,786
YOU'’D JUST AS SOON
AS SEEN HIM DEAD.

186
00:54:27,547 --> 00:54:30,216
NO.

187
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,981
PRODUCE IT.

188
00:54:53,907 --> 00:54:56,293
I KNOW WHERE IT GOES.

189
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:14,344
( bugle playing )

190
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:21,685

191
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:08,565

192
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:15,488

193
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:31,888
BESIDES
WHATEVER'’S GOING ON
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.

194
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,262
YEAH.

195
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,247
TAKE YOUR TIME.

196
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:30,113
( piano playing )

197
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:01,311
