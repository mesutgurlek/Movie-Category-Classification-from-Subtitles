00:00:16,047 --> 00:00:18,133
<i> Wichita </ i>

3
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:21,302
<i> Wichita </ i>

4
00:00:21,636 --> 00:00:26,349
In the city <i>
Wichita, Kansas </ i>

5
00:00:26,683 --> 00:00:31,312
<i> There was a man of peace </ i>

6
00:00:31,688 --> 00:00:36,276
<i> There was a lot of violence
in Wichita, Kansas </ i>

7
00:00:36,443 --> 00:00:41,406
<i> He told them all
that the killings must stop </ i>

8
00:00:41,614 --> 00:00:46,202
He faced the gun <i>
the worst men in Wichita </ i>

9
00:00:46,786 --> 00:00:51,332
<i> It forced them to lay down their arms </ i>

10
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:56,212
Nobody could play <i>

00:00:56,713 --> 00:01:01,259
<i> And for me,
it is a beautiful town </ i>

00:01:01,718 --> 00:01:05,305

<i> Wichita </ i>

<i> Wichita </ i>

19
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,807
The leader calls you, Ben.

20
00:02:01,236 --> 00:02:02,153
Yes, Mr. Wallace?

21
00:02:02,195 --> 00:02:05,448
There is water there
we spend the night.

22
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,659
It's less than an hour.
We stop soon.

23
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:10,745
It will be like that now.
It must fatten cattle

24
00:02:11,204 --> 00:02:12,122
Good.

25
00:02:53,038 --> 00:02:55,999
What's going on?
Now we work half a day?

26
00:02:56,041 --> 00:03:00,003
Calves have lost a lot of meat.
They have to eat to recover.

27
00:03:00,086 --> 00:03:04,466
- Well, we ride for two months.
- Two more days, it does not matter.

28
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:09,554
There is something, Ben?

29
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:13,892
No, your little brother
is eager to arrive.

30
00:03:14,934 --> 00:03:17,437
I too am a little worried.

31
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:20,357
So do I. Tell her to take
2 or 3 days.

32
00:03:20,398 --> 00:03:22,942
We will show
how to make a city.

33
00:03:39,084 --> 00:03:40,418
What do you think, Ben?

34
00:03:40,877 --> 00:03:42,337
Well, this is not an Indian.

35
00:03:42,796 --> 00:03:45,674
It could be a scout of thieves.
It y 'has a lot around here.

36
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:48,051
He goes to us
and it does not hide.

37
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:52,639
Sure he only wants
eat for free.

38
00:03:52,722 --> 00:03:55,266
Okay, he will eat.
But do not take risks.

39
00:03:56,768 --> 00:03:57,727
Al

40
00:04:02,107 --> 00:04:04,067
Go and investigate this jumper.

41
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:06,820
"Investigate" to what extent?

42
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:08,738
Make sure he is alone.

43
00:04:13,076 --> 00:04:16,830
If there are others who come
behind, we are ready.

44
00:04:44,774 --> 00:04:45,900
Hi

45
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:56,119
My name Earp.
Wyatt Earp.

46
00:04:56,244 --> 00:04:59,122
Go down and take a plate.
Tie your horse.

47
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:00,874
Thank you

48
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:18,099
Seeks some big gun he carries.

49
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,238
Thank you.

50
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,449
I was tired of my kitchen.

51
00:05:52,092 --> 00:05:53,426
My name is Clint Wallace.

52
00:05:53,677 --> 00:05:56,179
I know. I saw
W on your livestock.

53
00:05:56,888 --> 00:05:58,640
And I saw your land grow.

54
00:05:58,682 --> 00:06:00,475
Is that true? When?

55
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:03,728
A few years.
Beautiful region.

56
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:08,358
Quite a piece of artillery
you wear this, my friend.

57
00:06:09,275 --> 00:06:11,236
Yes, I need
in my work.

58
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:14,280
Beautiful revolver.

59
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,909
But that is not appropriate
a Texan.

60
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:20,120
We love them
of normal size.

61
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:24,082
Do not fight against a
Texas bringing this stuff.

62
00:06:24,124 --> 00:06:26,459
It would half an hour
to draw.

63
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:29,587
Recently, I fight
only against the Bison.

64
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,756
And they are not very fast
to draw.

65
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,177
You've been in Wichita?
here we go.

66
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:38,763
No, but I heard that
it is a great city.

67
00:06:38,805 --> 00:06:41,099
It grows rapidly since
there was the railroad.

68
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:44,436
Your herd must be the first.
It will be welcome.

69
00:06:44,477 --> 00:06:48,314
It suits us. How long have
we have seen neither drinks nor women.

70
00:06:48,898 --> 00:06:50,942
There are even those who could
take a bath.

71
00:06:51,526 --> 00:06:54,487
If you are looking for work,
you can come with us.

72
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:57,282
It's always good to have
Using the end of the trip.

73
00:06:57,907 --> 00:06:59,993
Thank you, Mr. Wallace, no.

74
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:02,954
I would arrive in Wichita
before you.

75
00:07:03,496 --> 00:07:05,623
I think I will open
trade there.

76
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:08,835
I hope
you are my customers.

77
00:07:08,877 --> 00:07:11,588
You can be sure,
if you open a bar.

78
00:07:12,005 --> 00:07:13,298
I go to bed.

79
00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:15,008
- Good night.
- Good night.

80
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:18,511
- Breakfast at dawn.
- Thank you.

81
00:07:18,595 --> 00:07:19,763
Ben Thompson.

82
00:07:20,263 --> 00:07:23,516
- Nice to meet you. You're the boss?
- Yes. See you tomorrow.

83
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:30,607
Then you open
trade, eh?

84
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:33,818
- Hunting the buffalo, it must report.
- Yeah.

85
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,865
What is important
is to find savings.

86
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,575
This one looks like one of those
that save.

87
00:07:41,534 --> 00:07:42,869
Bad habit.

88
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:46,581
Yes, very bad.

89
00:08:01,054 --> 00:08:02,722
The saddle bags.

90
00:08:03,473 --> 00:08:05,517
If he wakes up, I type.

91
00:08:57,902 --> 00:09:00,405
Hunting bison is better
than driving the cows.

92
00:09:00,572 --> 00:09:02,824
And hunt the hunters,
is even better.

93
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:06,202
With this, our first trip
Wichita will be ...

94
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:12,000
He woke up.

95
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,960
Yes. And how!

96
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:22,594
Okay, to you now.

97
00:09:30,477 --> 00:09:31,644
You heard.

98
00:09:33,897 --> 00:09:34,981
After you.

99
00:09:35,023 --> 00:09:36,399
Let me, Gyp.

100
00:09:51,122 --> 00:09:52,666
What is happening here?

101
00:09:52,957 --> 00:09:54,417
It's over, Thompson.

102
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:55,877
Two of your men
I wanted to fly,

103
00:09:55,877 --> 00:09:57,879
but I convinced them
to return my money.

104
00:09:57,921 --> 00:10:00,173
- He lies, Ben.
- Wait.

105
00:10:00,757 --> 00:10:02,676
I saw you draw.

106
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:05,553
Whether you right or wrong,
you will not kill my men.

107
00:10:06,846 --> 00:10:07,847
All right.

108
00:10:51,099 --> 00:10:52,517
Well, I'm going.

109
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:55,437
Thank you for your hospitality.

110
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:01,609
Bring something
for cleaning.

111
00:11:22,714 --> 00:11:25,008
It's over, guys.
We return to sleep.

112
00:11:31,348 --> 00:11:32,682
I will be in Wichita.

113
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,185
We!

114
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:46,738
EVERYTHING IS PERMITTED TO WICHITA

115
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,875
EVERYTHING IS PERMITTED TO WICHITA

116
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:08,927
And WINE WOMEN

117
00:12:31,032 --> 00:12:34,202
EVERYTHING IS PERMITTED TO WICHITA

118
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:27,005
- You arrive early, eh, cowboy?
- Yes, ma'am.

119
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:30,300
Like. "Bar and Lounge
Dance Empire. "

120
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:32,302
The most beautiful girls
of the city.

121
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:48,401
Good morning.

122
00:13:48,443 --> 00:13:49,486
Hello.

123
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,869
I finished, Mr. Whiteside.

124
00:13:57,952 --> 00:14:01,456
Good. Get out the "Aes" and "Es"
and bring them to me.

125
00:14:01,498 --> 00:14:04,209
Next, arrange up and go
the ceremony of the station.

126
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:06,419
- And hurry up.
- Yes, sir.

127
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:10,548
I'm sorry.
We do more ads.

128
00:14:10,715 --> 00:14:12,592
We must get out the paper.

129
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:15,303
I just want
find out.

130
00:14:15,345 --> 00:14:17,972
Is there another
team in town?

131
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:21,226
I do not want to leave
the horse in the street.

132
00:14:21,518 --> 00:14:24,020
It's full, eh?
It's been like this for 2 weeks.

133
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:30,235
You're one of those cowboys
that need to grow Wichita?

134
00:14:30,694 --> 00:14:33,363
No, I'm a traveler.

135
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,531
Player?

136
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:37,117
Businessman
if I find business.

137
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,744
Maybe another team?

138
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,915
A living room, that's the case
the most profitable.

139
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:46,835
It's not my department.
I respect the horse ...

140
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:49,045
Leave it behind the shop.

141
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:51,506
Thank you.

142
00:14:52,048 --> 00:14:53,925
- I will pay you.
- No way.

143
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:58,221
You are the first
not wanting to open a salon.

144
00:14:58,638 --> 00:15:00,306
It is a pleasure to help.

145
00:15:00,348 --> 00:15:03,393
- How do I go?
- It will do the trick.

146
00:15:03,393 --> 00:15:07,939
Wait. Pass it by.
It will not be dirtier.

147
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:14,112
Are you still there?

148
00:15:14,154 --> 00:15:17,115
A reporter should be in 1st place.
And do not forget the ads.

149
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:19,701
- You do not come, Mr. Whiteside?
- No.

150
00:15:20,994 --> 00:15:22,412
What's going on?

151
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:25,373
A ceremony.
For the arrival of the railway.

152
00:15:25,498 --> 00:15:29,002
Speeches, local color, even
of speech. Everyone goes there.

153
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:40,388
They are mine, young man?

154
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,015
- Yes, sir.
- Let me see.

155
00:15:44,392 --> 00:15:46,227
Well, I think it's good.

156
00:15:46,394 --> 00:15:49,564
Distributes them to the station and
brings the rest to my office.

157
00:15:49,606 --> 00:15:51,274
I can not, Mr. Black.

158
00:15:51,691 --> 00:15:53,818
I have to cover the event.

159
00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:57,489
- I do not have time to distribute.
- Find the time I pay you.

160
00:15:57,697 --> 00:15:59,449
That's not it, Mr. Black.

161
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:01,701
I work for the newspaper.

162
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:04,954
I was told to you
give it in the station.

163
00:16:05,288 --> 00:16:06,373
And that's all.

164
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,417
Stop. Do not
the devil with me.

165
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:11,086
Let me go.

166
00:16:11,586 --> 00:16:14,089
Let me go, Mr. Black
or I'll kill you.

167
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,173
Excuse me.

168
00:16:17,008 --> 00:16:19,010
I know where
is the station?

169
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:25,183
Yes, sir.
I go there.

170
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:38,738
- Thank you.
- Nothing.

171
00:16:38,947 --> 00:16:41,908
- My name is Wyatt Earp.
- Bat Masterson.

172
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,495
You were brave
to face a gun.

173
00:16:45,745 --> 00:16:48,999
I do not know what got into me,
Mr. Earp. I lost my cool.

174
00:16:49,582 --> 00:16:51,209
It was a mistake.

175
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:53,086
For sure.

176
00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:55,797
But you could not
do otherwise.

177
00:16:58,508 --> 00:16:59,801
It starts.

178
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:33,960
Wichita would be a
point on the road ...

179
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:38,965
... If there had been a man,
I am pleased to present.

180
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:42,844
Ladies and gentlemen, the man who
brought the railroad to Wichita.

181
00:17:43,178 --> 00:17:44,804
Sam McCoy.

182
00:17:48,683 --> 00:17:51,811
I just want to say something
and in a few words.

183
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:54,856
Wichita is the largest and
prosperous city in the West ...

184
00:17:55,023 --> 00:17:58,777
... If anyone remembers
one thing: the cattle!

185
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:00,820
It is a terminus
railway.

186
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:03,490
The point of embarkation
the breeding area.

187
00:18:04,157 --> 00:18:08,828
From here we feed
all the United States.

188
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:14,250
Do not forget it.
It is a city farm.

189
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:16,086
A city for breeders.

190
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:19,756
Here, we will ship
thousands of cows.

191
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,300
Hundreds of cowboys
will come here.

192
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:27,847
This will be our bread every day.
Yours, mine, that of Wichita.

193
00:18:28,181 --> 00:18:30,600
Very well, work!

194
00:18:36,523 --> 00:18:38,024
You have all noticed, Bat?

195
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:39,192
Almost everything.

196
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:42,862
I will interview Mr. McCoy.
See you, Mr. Earp.

197
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:51,955
I'm glad to see there has
effective journalists in Wichita.

198
00:18:51,955 --> 00:18:54,833
Thank you.
I would like your story.

199
00:18:54,874 --> 00:18:55,750
My story?

200
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,545
Where you are, what
you did before, and so on.

201
00:18:58,586 --> 00:19:00,005
Okay, my friend.

202
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:03,466
I have to go to the bank.
Come with us.

203
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:05,593
- We will discuss the way.
- Good.

204
00:19:05,635 --> 00:19:08,972
- Where were you born?
- Born? I was born in Philadelphia.

205
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:24,112
Good morning.
I want to open an account.

206
00:19:24,571 --> 00:19:25,739
Name?

207
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,115
Wyatt Earp.

208
00:19:29,993 --> 00:19:31,453
E-A-R-P.

209
00:19:31,786 --> 00:19:32,829
Address?

210
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,373
General Delivery to Wichita.

211
00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:37,792
Any file you want?

212
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:41,671
Everything except that.
There are 2460 dollars.

213
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:45,300
- All right, John.
- Thanks Sat I'm proud.

214
00:19:45,592 --> 00:19:47,177
Sign here, please.

215
00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:59,272
Everybody quiet!

216
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:01,900
No one moves.

217
00:20:01,941 --> 00:20:03,193
Well, close.

218
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,124
Take the jewelry.

219
00:20:29,594 --> 00:20:31,554
Relax, it's over.

220
00:20:34,307 --> 00:20:37,602
You, the men go out from here.

221
00:20:40,146 --> 00:20:41,940
Come on, move.

222
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:48,947
I owe you a debt of gratitude.
All of us.

223
00:20:48,988 --> 00:20:51,616
We're
grateful.

224
00:20:51,825 --> 00:20:54,411
- I am Sam McCoy.
- I know. I heard your speech.

225
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:57,288
- My name is Wyatt Earp.
- Nice to meet you.

226
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,962
Ladies, I present
Wyatt Earp.

227
00:21:04,004 --> 00:21:06,339
- My wife.
- How are you, Mr. Earp?

228
00:21:06,381 --> 00:21:08,717
- And my daughter Laurie.
- Hi.

229
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,218
It is an honor.

230
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:14,848
- Thank you.
- Nothing, Miss McCoy.

231
00:21:20,186 --> 00:21:22,522
You are here on business?

232
00:21:22,605 --> 00:21:24,816
I would like,
but I do not know what.

233
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:27,819
Well, if you want
work ...

234
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:31,364
... We have a problem
enforce the law. Wichita grew up ...

235
00:21:31,364 --> 00:21:34,951
Thank you, Mr. Mayor, I am
merchant, not police.

236
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,953
In addition, you have a Sheriff.

237
00:21:36,953 --> 00:21:39,622
We would not refuse a
another, especially a man like you.

238
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:43,543
Think about it. I assure you,
together, ...

239
00:21:43,918 --> 00:21:46,004
... We will pay you very well.

240
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:47,047
No, thank you, Mr.

241
00:21:47,255 --> 00:21:50,091
Good. Good luck
what you do.

242
00:21:50,383 --> 00:21:53,970
- Count on me.
- Thank you. Good day.

243
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,806
Your book, Mr.

244
00:21:57,474 --> 00:22:00,226
Thank you.
I was going to lose, right?

245
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,235
A real man. Too bad he did not
accepted the position

246
00:22:09,652 --> 00:22:11,321
He may accept it soon.

247
00:22:11,905 --> 00:22:14,908
This is a lawyer born.

248
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,577
Do not lose sight of.

249
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:38,515
FOREIGN leaked BANDITS

250
00:22:44,604 --> 00:22:47,857
- Good evening.
- Bat, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Whiteside.

251
00:22:48,858 --> 00:22:50,318
What a title!

252
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,071
"Foreign leaked bandits."

253
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:56,408
Masterson loves alliteration.

254
00:22:56,449 --> 00:22:59,244
You should have seen the title
he wanted to.

255
00:22:59,285 --> 00:23:02,831
= "Pistolero Protects Pognon
Felling guilty. "

256
00:23:03,665 --> 00:23:05,417
- A glass?
- No, thank you

257
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,794
I explained to our reporter ...

258
00:23:08,294 --> 00:23:11,047
... There is a difference between
a gunslinger and a gunman

259
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:13,425
How do you know
Am I?

260
00:23:13,466 --> 00:23:15,885
I judge by deeds.

261
00:23:16,052 --> 00:23:20,056
An armed man defending the law.
That's what you did.

262
00:23:20,306 --> 00:23:22,726
Did you like my story?
This is the first.

263
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:27,313
It is well written, but you do not say everything.
You do not say what you did, you.

264
00:23:27,397 --> 00:23:29,524
He is a young very modest.

265
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:34,237
and it is difficult to talk about
himself in third person.

266
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,114
By the way ...

267
00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:40,410
... We talked about you.

268
00:23:40,618 --> 00:23:42,078
It is not the only,
for that matter.

269
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:46,333
If it's for the office of Sheriff,
I'm not interested.

270
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:50,837
We want to know why.
Do not say anything if you do not want.

271
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:55,800
I think there are others who
would work in this career.

272
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,426
Not me.

273
00:23:56,426 --> 00:23:59,095
Frankly, I do
not blame you.

274
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:01,431
It's hard work and thankless.

275
00:24:01,598 --> 00:24:05,977
Yes, in addition to maintaining order,
Sheriff is always a target.

276
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:11,316
Several gunmen dream
to become famous by killing one.

277
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:14,110
Count on me,
Mr. Mayor.

278
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:18,114
But only as a citizen,
not as a man of the law.

279
00:24:18,656 --> 00:24:19,866
Good evening.

280
00:24:23,036 --> 00:24:26,956
It does not seem too much
worry about the danger.

281
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:30,669
Nobody likes you
shoots him.

282
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:34,005
No one fired at the
Sheriff we have.

283
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:37,676
Billy Smith?
You call that a Sheriff?

284
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:39,344
He was all his life.

285
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:43,431
He was fired from all the villages
this side of the Mississippi.

286
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:49,312
How can he take
when these cowboys are crazy here?

287
00:24:49,562 --> 00:24:52,148
I heard he had the chips
Allsworth to it two years ago.

288
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,358
"Chips"?

289
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:57,153
Expression of the West, which means
he was scared to death.

290
00:24:57,946 --> 00:25:00,532
I think I remember.

291
00:25:01,282 --> 00:25:03,785
Cowboys had drunk
started shooting into the crowd

292
00:25:03,785 --> 00:25:05,328
They got rid of Smith.

293
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:10,875
... But put them in a foreign
prison without firing a shot.

294
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,129
And I remember his name.

295
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,715
Wyatt Earp.

296
00:25:17,632 --> 00:25:20,301
What a shame.
This is what we need.

297
00:25:21,845 --> 00:25:24,764
You should have seen how
handles the revolver.

298
00:25:25,473 --> 00:25:28,309
He drew to injure,
not to kill.

299
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,647
He has other qualities,
know how to take apart.

300
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:37,360
He is a man of law,
by vocation.

301
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:39,404
But he refuses to admit it.

302
00:25:39,988 --> 00:25:41,448
What are you talking about?

303
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,243
In Boston, I met a blacksmith
which was the same.

304
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,162
In his case,
was religion.

305
00:25:47,287 --> 00:25:49,622
He was a born preacher.

306
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:51,374
But he resisted.

307
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:55,170
One day the preacher
became ill.

308
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,881
The blacksmith was replaced.

309
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,801
He spent the rest of his life
to serve God.

310
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,387
The best predictor
I've seen.

311
00:26:05,221 --> 00:26:08,350
Serve God and serve the Act,
is not the same.

312
00:26:08,808 --> 00:26:10,310
I do not agree.

313
00:26:10,852 --> 00:26:13,813
Both need
a dedicated man.

314
00:26:14,731 --> 00:26:17,734
You know what I mean
by "dedicated".

315
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:22,781
Go to bed, Arthur.

316
00:26:23,239 --> 00:26:24,240
Bat ...

317
00:26:25,075 --> 00:26:26,576
If I take care of him.

318
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:36,586
You think Wyatt Earp
accept the position?

319
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:39,255
If he does,
is that it's crazy.

320
00:26:39,714 --> 00:26:42,467
If he does not
it will become unlivable here.

321
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:47,597
You saw the cowboys
terrorize a city?

322
00:26:47,889 --> 00:26:48,848
No, sir.

323
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:50,350
I do.

324
00:26:52,018 --> 00:26:53,520
This is the show.

325
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:57,565
They draw on windows,
the lights ...

326
00:26:58,692 --> 00:27:00,110
... Objects ...

327
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,239
One night
they killed my wife.

328
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:09,828
You close, right?

329
00:27:11,538 --> 00:27:12,580
Yes, sir.

330
00:27:52,454 --> 00:27:54,622
Here they come,
those who make history.

331
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:05,383
Here!
It's yours!

332
00:28:22,984 --> 00:28:26,363
The Texans are there
and this city will never be the same.

333
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:30,492
Listen, guys. I do not want
see one sober man.

334
00:28:33,286 --> 00:28:35,538
- It is here, Sam
- Well, Clint.

335
00:28:35,538 --> 00:28:37,707
How long
will you stay in Wichita?

336
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:38,625
There is no rush.

337
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:42,462
The cowboys will not leave that
when they will have more money.

338
00:28:42,712 --> 00:28:44,339
Or when you will
more alcohol.

339
00:28:44,464 --> 00:28:46,925
About alcohol.
I pay the first round.

340
00:28:46,966 --> 00:28:49,177
With pleasure.
I pay the next.

341
00:28:56,518 --> 00:28:59,062
Babylon on the Arkansas River.

342
00:28:59,354 --> 00:29:00,980
Without hanging gardens.

343
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:04,442
You have decided what kind
business you get started?

344
00:29:04,526 --> 00:29:06,027
No, not yet.

345
00:29:06,069 --> 00:29:08,113
There is room for
other bars.

346
00:29:08,238 --> 00:29:13,159
- I saw Bat come with chefs.
- It will be good. He does not drink again.

347
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:17,330
As long as it is with Wallace,
the cowboys leave him alone.

348
00:29:17,414 --> 00:29:19,374
I hope.
It's a good boy.

349
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:22,293
His problem
that he does not know fear.

350
00:29:22,502 --> 00:29:24,838
- And you?
- Yes, I have learned.

351
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,132
No, what you have learned,
is discretion.

352
00:29:27,173 --> 00:29:30,760
Which, according to philosophers,
is the best part of courage.

353
00:29:30,885 --> 00:29:35,098
Maybe. I have never tried
problems deliberately, but ...

354
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,850
... But they are the ones
who you are.

355
00:29:37,267 --> 00:29:39,769
You have a drink
with me, Wyatt?

356
00:29:40,228 --> 00:29:42,814
No, thank you. Good evening.

357
00:29:43,606 --> 00:29:44,941
Yes, that's for sure.

358
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,031
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

359
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,324
I help you?

360
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:56,077
Very kind of you,
it is very heavy.

361
00:29:58,413 --> 00:30:01,708
Well, they are there now.
It's interesting, right?

362
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:03,626
Yes, we can say that.

363
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:07,922
Miss, I do not advise you
to go alone in the streets.

364
00:30:07,964 --> 00:30:10,467
At least
until the start of the cowboys.

365
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:13,678
- You believe that there will be violence?
- Yes, I think.

366
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:32,238
- Thank you.
- It was a pleasure.

367
00:30:34,741 --> 00:30:36,076
Ah, Miss McCoy.

368
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,037
It may be that you hear
shots that night.

369
00:30:39,162 --> 00:30:41,289
Do not worry, your mother and you.

370
00:30:41,498 --> 00:30:44,167
Stay away from windows
and turn off the lights.

371
00:30:44,668 --> 00:30:47,170
I have heard of these
Wild nights in the West,

372
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,047
But I did not think it existed.

373
00:30:49,255 --> 00:30:50,590
If it exists.

374
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,135
It is a concern, is not it?

375
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:56,012
Yes.

376
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:59,974
I have always lived in the West.
I saw many villages like this one.

377
00:31:00,183 --> 00:31:02,310
Violence always affects me.

378
00:31:02,977 --> 00:31:05,021
I should be used.

379
00:31:05,772 --> 00:31:07,774
You are strange.

380
00:31:08,358 --> 00:31:12,070
- You think so?
- Yes, the bank, you were different.

381
00:31:12,362 --> 00:31:14,239
I was born under an unlucky star

382
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,783
It happens all the
time things like that.

383
00:31:18,326 --> 00:31:20,203
You will be careful tonight?

384
00:31:20,996 --> 00:31:23,164
Yes. Thank you.

385
00:31:23,498 --> 00:31:25,959
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

386
00:31:50,025 --> 00:31:51,568
Hey, boy!

387
00:31:52,318 --> 00:31:54,487
- Fill the glass.
- Yes, sir.

388
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:34,402
And voila, Gyp!
I told you that you're swimming.

389
00:32:35,695 --> 00:32:38,281
We Texans,
you can bathe together.

390
00:32:59,969 --> 00:33:02,889
I sold the entire herd.
He leaves tomorrow.

391
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:07,435
I saw several villages ephemeral
but remain Wichita.

392
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,230
- Ha!
- Why do you laugh?

393
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,648
You are drunk.

394
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:14,484
Whiteside, you are
a reporter drunk.

395
00:33:14,943 --> 00:33:18,238
I do not like journalists drunk.

396
00:33:18,822 --> 00:33:20,365
and sober.

397
00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:22,951
And I hate the breeders!

398
00:33:22,993 --> 00:33:26,913
We drink to that.
Wichita and the Wild.

399
00:33:28,957 --> 00:33:31,918
Where were you, kid?
Take a drink.

400
00:33:32,085 --> 00:33:34,879
No, thank you.
Come on, sir.

401
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:43,013
I think he does not like cowboys.

402
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:47,767
Of course, if everyone likes you.
He can not drink like you, that's all.

403
00:33:48,435 --> 00:33:51,062
If I resist alcohol.

404
00:33:51,438 --> 00:33:53,106
Take us at Bar Keno.

405
00:33:55,775 --> 00:33:59,446
Clint, we are too old
to drink all night.

406
00:33:59,696 --> 00:34:01,156
Maybe you're right.

407
00:34:01,197 --> 00:34:05,452
Let's go home.
Mary prepared you a room.

408
00:34:05,493 --> 00:34:09,122
You know, Sam? The Mary
a woman is very hospitable.

409
00:34:13,001 --> 00:34:14,294
How are you, sir?

410
00:34:19,716 --> 00:34:21,551
What time is it, Bat?

411
00:34:25,347 --> 00:34:26,723
20 midnight.

412
00:34:27,015 --> 00:34:28,558
It will soon begin.

413
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:33,855
Do you think they will sow
the mess in Wichita?

414
00:34:33,897 --> 00:34:38,777
Take note of the paper and
all the details as you can.

415
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,244
Gyp!

416
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,622
- Gyp Clemens!
- I arrive.

417
00:34:51,206 --> 00:34:52,582
What is the matter?

418
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:54,959
Taste it.

419
00:34:57,879 --> 00:34:59,464
I like it.

420
00:34:59,589 --> 00:35:02,092
No, it tastes horrible.

421
00:35:06,846 --> 00:35:09,391
You're right. It's disgusting.

422
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:17,691
Alcohol is adulterated, guys!
We need fresh air!

423
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,081
What's going on?

424
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,541
You'll soon find out.

425
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:37,919
Stay inside
until everything is finished.

426
00:36:47,989 --> 00:36:49,783
Make her sit down.
Call a physician.

427
00:36:49,866 --> 00:36:52,577
- There is no doctor in Wichita.
- I know a little.

428
00:36:52,702 --> 00:36:54,537
Bring towels
and water.

429
00:36:55,205 --> 00:36:56,623
It does not matter.

430
00:36:57,707 --> 00:36:59,459
- Well ...
- What, well?

431
00:38:07,068 --> 00:38:08,194
Give me your badge.

432
00:38:08,194 --> 00:38:10,071
You are mad, you do
no time will stand out.

433
00:38:10,113 --> 00:38:11,239
Give it to me!

434
00:38:12,574 --> 00:38:14,492
- You have a gun?
- A gun?

435
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,786
You heard.
I have one. Go get him.

436
00:38:28,381 --> 00:38:29,507
One moment, Wyatt.

437
00:38:30,216 --> 00:38:31,509
Raise your right hand.

438
00:38:32,052 --> 00:38:35,305
Do you swear to defend the law of the United States
and this community?

439
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:38,308
- I swear.
- I called Sheriff of Wichita.

440
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:45,065
It's a dead man.

441
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:53,698
There remain 20.

442
00:38:53,948 --> 00:38:57,035
Others have fallen horse
or left.

443
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:02,165
They will continue until
too tired or hungry to gallop.

444
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,042
Which may last until morning.

445
00:39:04,834 --> 00:39:06,252
Mr. Whiteside, look!

446
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:22,686
Hey, boys!

447
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,021
Look who is!

448
00:39:25,522 --> 00:39:28,149
And he wears a badge brand new!

449
00:39:28,525 --> 00:39:30,652
Hey Gyp! Where are you?

450
00:39:31,152 --> 00:39:32,237
Here.

451
00:39:34,114 --> 00:39:37,200
I have two loads of buckshot
pointed at you.

452
00:39:37,492 --> 00:39:40,745
At this distance, I can remove 5.

453
00:39:40,996 --> 00:39:42,205
What are you playing?

454
00:39:42,372 --> 00:39:46,710
I play to stop.
Tell them to throw their weapons.

455
00:39:51,673 --> 00:39:53,758
You have ten seconds.

456
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:56,177
Un

457
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,096
Two.

458
00:39:58,972 --> 00:40:00,140
Three.

459
00:40:00,974 --> 00:40:02,183
Four.

460
00:40:03,018 --> 00:40:04,394
Five.

461
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:06,229
Six.

462
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,481
Sept.

463
00:40:09,524 --> 00:40:10,442
Eight.

464
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,736
Throw it out, guys,
He was not joking!

465
00:40:15,822 --> 00:40:17,032
Maire.

466
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:20,994
Open the prison,
I stopped.

467
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:26,624
- You make a mistake.
- You will die for it.

468
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:30,295
Take your men in prison.
Let the horses tied.

469
00:40:30,503 --> 00:40:33,381
- Listen ...
- You are all arrested.

470
00:40:34,382 --> 00:40:35,675
Forward.

471
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,853
Listen.

472
00:40:48,104 --> 00:40:49,481
I'll take my gun ...

473
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:52,942
- ... and we will ...
- No. You're under arrest.

474
00:40:52,942 --> 00:40:56,404
Really? So come on,
help yourself a gun.

475
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:58,490
Only in this way
take me to jail.

476
00:40:58,531 --> 00:40:59,616
Bat!

477
00:41:02,577 --> 00:41:04,371
Take this and cover the men.

478
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:07,457
If one of them moves, shoot.
No need to aim.

479
00:41:11,419 --> 00:41:13,088
I do not want to kill you, Clemens.

480
00:41:13,588 --> 00:41:15,298
Now or never.

481
00:41:15,757 --> 00:41:17,759
Turn around and goes to prison.

482
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,376
Keep your gun.

483
00:41:51,584 --> 00:41:52,669
Ah, yes.

484
00:41:56,172 --> 00:41:58,299
- Thank you.
- Nothing.

485
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:05,015
- Good evening, Mr. Mayor.
- Wyatt.

486
00:42:05,932 --> 00:42:09,227
The trial will take place at ten o'clock.
I need your testimony.

487
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:10,270
Good. I'll be there.

488
00:42:10,478 --> 00:42:14,065
- What should I do about them?
- I do not know, it's your job.

489
00:42:14,357 --> 00:42:16,359
I can only condemn
in fines.

490
00:42:16,693 --> 00:42:19,612
Well, do it,
and I will make them leave the city.

491
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:21,948
There are many people
who will not like that.

492
00:42:22,574 --> 00:42:23,908
And you?

493
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:27,245
This may be a bit harsh.

494
00:42:28,997 --> 00:42:31,166
- Good night.
- Good night, Wyatt.

495
00:42:54,481 --> 00:42:55,273
Good morning.

496
00:42:55,357 --> 00:42:57,442
You have enclosed my men?

497
00:42:57,525 --> 00:42:59,152
- Yes.
- For what reason?

498
00:42:59,235 --> 00:43:01,863
- Disturbances of public order.
- "Disturbing public order"?

499
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:05,200
I pay their fines and you make them out.
They have to die of thirst.

500
00:43:05,325 --> 00:43:08,411
Judging will take place at 10 am.
You can pay then.

501
00:43:08,453 --> 00:43:10,497
I pay now
they spent enough time there.

502
00:43:10,497 --> 00:43:12,582
I'm sorry, Mr. Wallace.
In 10 hours.

503
00:43:12,582 --> 00:43:15,543
There are only 3 hours.
See you soon.

504
00:43:16,044 --> 00:43:17,170
Listen!

505
00:43:22,592 --> 00:43:25,345
Maybe you do not understand.
I will speak clearly.

506
00:43:25,595 --> 00:43:28,056
I want them free
for 10 minutes.

507
00:43:28,098 --> 00:43:33,103
If they are not in the street,
we will destroy you with the prison.

508
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:34,979
Of calm.

509
00:43:36,356 --> 00:43:39,359
You will not come,
because you will be in prison.

510
00:43:40,777 --> 00:43:42,737
For threats against an officer of the law.

511
00:43:43,822 --> 00:43:48,535
Tell your friends free.
Judging will take place at 10 am.

512
00:43:48,576 --> 00:43:50,495
You can attend.

513
00:43:50,954 --> 00:43:53,707
I'll kill the first
trying to escape.

514
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,668
Questions?

515
00:43:59,587 --> 00:44:01,673
Well
Questions?

516
00:44:05,218 --> 00:44:07,178
By this, Mr. Wallace.

517
00:44:42,547 --> 00:44:44,674
I do not want more problems,
Mr. Wallace.

518
00:44:49,429 --> 00:44:51,097
Lets through.

519
00:44:53,433 --> 00:44:55,602
You're a dead man.
Thou art conscious?

520
00:45:05,612 --> 00:45:08,406
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. McCoy.

521
00:45:09,449 --> 00:45:11,660
I'm glad you
accepted the job.

522
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,161
What made you change your mind?

523
00:45:13,495 --> 00:45:15,288
Well, several things.

524
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:17,082
I saw you in action
yesterday.

525
00:45:17,082 --> 00:45:20,001
How you
handled these men is admirable

526
00:45:20,043 --> 00:45:21,127
Thank you.

527
00:45:21,419 --> 00:45:22,921
What you do
make them pay fines?

528
00:45:23,213 --> 00:45:25,965
This is the case of the mayor.
The trial will take place at ten o'clock.

529
00:45:26,549 --> 00:45:28,718
If you'll excuse me,
I'll take my breakfast.

530
00:45:29,052 --> 00:45:30,220
Sheriff.

531
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:33,556
You stopped Clint Wallace?

532
00:45:34,182 --> 00:45:35,308
Exact.

533
00:45:35,392 --> 00:45:38,978
Why? It did not take part
disorders of the night.

534
00:45:39,562 --> 00:45:43,400
I stopped to avoid problems.
He wanted to free his men.

535
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:45,026
He was not speaking seriously.

536
00:45:45,235 --> 00:45:47,320
Surely not.
He only wanted to bluff you.

537
00:45:47,404 --> 00:45:52,200
I do not think so. In any case,
I would not risk more violence.

538
00:45:52,701 --> 00:45:53,785
Wyatt.

539
00:45:54,828 --> 00:45:56,746
You do not think of one thing.

540
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:59,833
Wichita depends on these breeders.

541
00:45:59,916 --> 00:46:02,544
Men like Wallace
and cowboys.

542
00:46:03,753 --> 00:46:05,255
They are important to us.

543
00:46:07,215 --> 00:46:11,386
Occasionally, they make noise
but we must make concessions.

544
00:46:11,386 --> 00:46:13,471
I do not agree, McCoy.

545
00:46:13,888 --> 00:46:17,392
Not when there is damage
and the dead.

546
00:46:18,184 --> 00:46:20,020
Somebody died tonight?

547
00:46:20,186 --> 00:46:22,272
- Of the city?
- Yes.

548
00:46:22,522 --> 00:46:23,606
Who?

549
00:46:23,815 --> 00:46:25,817
His name was Michael Jackson.

550
00:46:26,026 --> 00:46:27,902
It was 5 years old.

551
00:46:41,916 --> 00:46:44,127
- And do not come back!
- Who do you take?

552
00:46:44,669 --> 00:46:48,381
I'm the Sheriff and I do not want
see these men here.

553
00:46:48,423 --> 00:46:49,466
Me too?

554
00:46:50,091 --> 00:46:53,553
No, neither you nor those
have fired that night.

555
00:46:55,305 --> 00:46:56,639
Here is your weapons.

556
00:46:59,142 --> 00:47:00,226
Come.

557
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:19,162
Thank you, Bat.

558
00:47:27,587 --> 00:47:29,881
This also applies to residents.

559
00:47:30,298 --> 00:47:31,841
I want to be your assistant.

560
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:35,929
It would take me a year older than you.

561
00:47:37,722 --> 00:47:38,556
Who?

562
00:47:38,932 --> 00:47:42,435
Good question.
I know no one else here.

563
00:47:43,895 --> 00:47:46,731
I'll call some friends.
Meanwhile, ...

564
00:47:46,898 --> 00:47:48,316
... the job is yours.

565
00:47:49,776 --> 00:47:50,902
You know you use this?

566
00:47:51,486 --> 00:47:54,280
I know shoot
but I'm still not fast.

567
00:47:54,364 --> 00:47:55,532
Do not try.

568
00:47:55,615 --> 00:47:59,202
If you must use them as,
you have to fly the first time.

569
00:47:59,285 --> 00:48:00,328
Yes, sir.

570
00:48:00,787 --> 00:48:04,791
Come, I will procure a badge
and we will put up posters everywhere.

571
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:07,919
FIREARMS ARE PROHIBITED
IN THE STREETS OF WICHITA

572
00:48:13,299 --> 00:48:17,470
I believe in what you do, but I
do not know if this is the right solution.

573
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:19,305
However there is no other, Mr. Whiteside.

574
00:48:19,389 --> 00:48:22,684
Unarmed, they can not
is shot. It's that simple.

575
00:48:22,767 --> 00:48:25,937
This measure will not
make you popular.

576
00:48:26,187 --> 00:48:28,940
Without guns, people
are defenseless.

577
00:48:29,524 --> 00:48:31,318
As you watch over their safety.

578
00:48:31,568 --> 00:48:33,945
You know I did not want
of this work.

579
00:48:33,987 --> 00:48:36,072
But you accepted
and you will.

580
00:48:36,156 --> 00:48:37,991
Bat and I are with you.

581
00:48:38,074 --> 00:48:39,159
I read your editorial.

582
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:41,828
It is a consolation to know
we are not alone.

583
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:44,789
A newspaper is a little more
a consolation.

584
00:48:44,873 --> 00:48:48,877
It should guide public opinion,
exert influence.

585
00:48:48,918 --> 00:48:50,962
But it takes time,
Mr. Whiteside.

586
00:48:51,546 --> 00:48:53,631
How long have you, Wyatt?

587
00:48:54,299 --> 00:48:56,634
- What it takes.
- Good.

588
00:48:56,843 --> 00:48:58,345
Take it.

589
00:48:59,054 --> 00:49:00,889
Thank you for your support.
Both of them.

590
00:49:01,014 --> 00:49:03,850
It is a pleasure
and a privilege, Sheriff.

591
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:08,188
I think it will get there
if they leave him alone.

592
00:49:08,229 --> 00:49:11,191
- "They," the cowboys?
- No, citizens.

593
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:16,696
What will happen to Wichita when
it is known that there is a Sheriff crazy?

594
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,574
I can tell you.
It will be a ghost town.

595
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:24,454
No breeder will come to a city
which can not carry weapons.

596
00:49:24,663 --> 00:49:26,998
- We need to ...
- Hi, Doc, John, Andrew.

597
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,877
- Sam, you must do something.
- I know it's why I called.

598
00:49:30,919 --> 00:49:34,422
Andrew, talk to him.
Tell him that he exaggerates.

599
00:49:34,464 --> 00:49:37,050
It is not the type to which
they say how do its job.

600
00:49:37,175 --> 00:49:39,219
It does so in its own way
or it does not.

601
00:49:39,344 --> 00:49:41,471
- I think it's good.
- What do you say?

602
00:49:41,471 --> 00:49:44,349
We need a good sheriff.
You agree.

603
00:49:44,391 --> 00:49:47,644
Sam, we can all be ruined ...

604
00:49:47,727 --> 00:49:49,980
... If you can not stop the Sheriff.

605
00:49:50,689 --> 00:49:55,026
Much money has been invested in this
city into a center of cattle.

606
00:49:55,151 --> 00:49:56,736
And if the farmers do not?

607
00:49:56,736 --> 00:49:59,906
And they will not believe me.
What will become of us?

608
00:50:00,365 --> 00:50:04,661
- What will transport your train?
- Doc, it's not as bad.

609
00:50:04,786 --> 00:50:06,079
Not yet, anyway.

610
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:08,498
Here's what we will do.

611
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,209
We will invite the Sheriff
a ceremony.

612
00:50:11,376 --> 00:50:14,295
We will explain the situation.

613
00:50:14,379 --> 00:50:16,631
Maybe he did not understand.

614
00:50:16,798 --> 00:50:19,175
It's a good idea, Sat

615
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:21,136
And if it does not work?

616
00:50:21,845 --> 00:50:23,179
It gets rid of him.

617
00:50:23,638 --> 00:50:27,142
Andrew was recruited,
Andrew return it. That simple.

618
00:50:31,021 --> 00:50:33,606
Even the cake, Sheriff?

619
00:50:33,732 --> 00:50:34,983
No, thank you, ma'am.

620
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:38,320
I thought the country people
had an appetite.

621
00:50:38,445 --> 00:50:41,656
Out of town.
You should see me in a picnic.

622
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:44,951
- I would like.
- Tomorrow, then?

623
00:50:45,035 --> 00:50:49,039
The new Sheriff
do not waste time.

624
00:50:50,332 --> 00:50:54,711
Ladies, we take coffee
while the men are smoking?

625
00:50:59,132 --> 00:51:01,384
Do you like fried chicken?

626
00:51:06,598 --> 00:51:08,266
Let's drink to Wichita.

627
00:51:12,062 --> 00:51:13,271
Although the children.

628
00:51:13,772 --> 00:51:16,316
- Come see the guest.
- Certainly.

629
00:51:16,399 --> 00:51:19,944
It is our pleasure to hear that,
if they are not empty words.

630
00:51:20,153 --> 00:51:22,405
I do not know if I understand you.

631
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:24,991
Listen, we are
business people.

632
00:51:25,241 --> 00:51:26,785
Citizens of Wichita.

633
00:51:27,327 --> 00:51:30,121
We can say that we ...

634
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:34,209
... Represent the city.
Okay?

635
00:51:34,459 --> 00:51:37,837
- Up to a point.
- That is to say?

636
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:41,132
No one can represent
a city ...

637
00:51:41,174 --> 00:51:43,677
... If he was not elected
by citizens.

638
00:51:43,802 --> 00:51:46,763
And the only elected here
Hope is the mayor.

639
00:51:47,889 --> 00:51:51,976
It's true.
Andrew, you should talk to Wichita.

640
00:51:53,895 --> 00:51:55,480
Good idea, Andrew.

641
00:51:59,651 --> 00:52:01,569
Cards on the table, Wyatt.

642
00:52:02,028 --> 00:52:05,949
This group, which is
as a city council

643
00:52:06,366 --> 00:52:09,119
... Believes that your reforms
are too severe.

644
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,246
I see.

645
00:52:11,454 --> 00:52:13,915
I guess it is the prohibition
of weapons.

646
00:52:13,957 --> 00:52:16,376
Of course.
It is a mistake.

647
00:52:16,459 --> 00:52:21,506
Men sometimes freely choose
to leave their guns at home.

648
00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:24,426
But that day has not arrived yet.

649
00:52:24,551 --> 00:52:26,970
In Wichita, if
As Sheriff I would.

650
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:30,223
- It can get better.
- One moment, Doc.

651
00:52:30,807 --> 00:52:32,642
Enervon does not.

652
00:52:33,435 --> 00:52:34,477
Wyatt.

653
00:52:36,021 --> 00:52:38,231
We know you
act in good faith.

654
00:52:38,315 --> 00:52:41,526
Whether your interest in Wichita
is sincere.

655
00:52:43,695 --> 00:52:46,990
It's just that you do not see
the business side, that's all.

656
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:50,577
- You have to recognize it.
- Yes, I admit.

657
00:52:50,618 --> 00:52:55,582
I know that depends Wichita
cattle and cowboys.

658
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:57,417
- It is a growing city.
- No.

659
00:52:57,792 --> 00:52:58,877
That's not it.

660
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,422
She is tall, it grows
and we hope to grow with it.

661
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:06,217
But we need farmers.

662
00:53:06,343 --> 00:53:09,220
Remember that I did not
applied for that position.

663
00:53:09,304 --> 00:53:11,723
You have offered me and I refused.

664
00:53:12,557 --> 00:53:16,061
I changed my mind tonight
and you know why.

665
00:53:17,312 --> 00:53:18,772
Now I am committed.

666
00:53:20,607 --> 00:53:24,027
I will not change in method
and I will not give up.

667
00:53:24,736 --> 00:53:26,112
It will remove me.

668
00:53:29,574 --> 00:53:31,951
As Doc said
there is a time ...

669
00:53:32,702 --> 00:53:35,080
- ... It can be arranged.
- Well, fix it.

670
00:53:36,331 --> 00:53:37,916
Well, Andrew, go ahead.

671
00:53:42,879 --> 00:53:44,005
Sheriff!

672
00:53:51,554 --> 00:53:52,472
Sheriff!

673
00:53:54,182 --> 00:53:55,475
My gun, please.

674
00:53:55,934 --> 00:53:57,227
Who and where, Bat?

675
00:53:57,352 --> 00:53:59,771
Cowboys from those of W
that you stopped yesterday.

676
00:53:59,896 --> 00:54:01,231
They are in the Texas House.

677
00:54:03,692 --> 00:54:04,776
So, Mr. Mayor?

678
00:54:04,818 --> 00:54:06,069
So what, Sheriff?

679
00:54:11,241 --> 00:54:13,451
- Andrew, you have committed ...
- Calm down, calm.

680
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:17,163
Well, Andrew.
it can be done tomorrow.

681
00:54:17,455 --> 00:54:19,582
The Clemens are in town.

682
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:21,668
Although they will be
solve it themselves.

683
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,425
The Sheriff does not seem
want to come.

684
00:54:28,842 --> 00:54:30,468
He will come.

685
00:54:43,106 --> 00:54:45,150
A large W.

686
00:54:48,278 --> 00:54:50,572
- What you gonna do?
- Look at this.

687
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,037
Hands in the air.

688
00:55:01,708 --> 00:55:02,959
Raise them!

689
00:55:07,088 --> 00:55:09,215
I will not bother
to stop this time.

690
00:55:09,424 --> 00:55:11,634
- What was there, Sheriff?
- Shut up!

691
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,554
No one can pay
one hundred dollars.

692
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:18,600
I told you not to return
As I am the Sheriff.

693
00:55:19,434 --> 00:55:21,770
If I see you again here,
I kill you.

694
00:55:21,936 --> 00:55:23,313
Now, get out!

695
00:55:32,197 --> 00:55:33,448
Not now.

696
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:41,581
We will return.

697
00:55:41,623 --> 00:55:44,626
Do not come back. I told you
what would happen.

698
00:55:45,293 --> 00:55:47,337
If you had wanted to kill us,
why you did not.

699
00:55:47,337 --> 00:55:48,213
You have had the opportunity.

700
00:55:48,296 --> 00:55:51,216
I do not want, Gyp.
Do not make me.

701
00:56:05,146 --> 00:56:07,023
It was you who roast the chicken?

702
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:08,775
Of course it's me.

703
00:56:08,858 --> 00:56:11,987
- And the cake too.
- I'm impressed

704
00:56:12,696 --> 00:56:14,406
Well, I do not know why.

705
00:56:14,447 --> 00:56:17,158
The kitchen is made of 90%
by women in that country.

706
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,452
- Who taught you?
- My mother.

707
00:56:19,995 --> 00:56:21,663
It is the habit, you know.

708
00:56:22,872 --> 00:56:25,417
Apparently you're interested
little girls.

709
00:56:26,876 --> 00:56:30,338
It would have interested
if there were more like you.

710
00:56:33,883 --> 00:56:35,677
You do not lose
time, eh, Wyatt?

711
00:56:35,885 --> 00:56:38,513
Before, time did not seem
not important.

712
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,016
Now if and I do not want
lose a minute.

713
00:56:45,228 --> 00:56:46,855
We should leave.

714
00:57:22,057 --> 00:57:28,438
FIREARMS ARE PROHIBITED
IN THE STREETS OF WICHITA

715
00:58:04,057 --> 00:58:05,183
What do you take?

716
00:58:05,642 --> 00:58:06,726
Whiskey.

717
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:16,945
You have not seen the posters?
No revolvers.

718
00:58:17,529 --> 00:58:18,571
We know read.

719
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:33,003
Doc, you expect from gunmen
Grand W?

720
00:58:33,044 --> 00:58:35,046
Yes, for several days,
they arrived?

721
00:58:35,088 --> 00:58:35,547
It seems.

722
00:58:35,547 --> 00:58:39,050
Two types of drive type that does
are not separated from their artillery.

723
00:58:39,759 --> 00:58:40,885
Tell them to enter.

724
00:58:49,936 --> 00:58:51,813
The leader wants to talk.

725
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:54,691
- What?
- I do not know. He is there.

726
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:57,444
- What do we owe you?
- The house calls.

727
00:58:58,403 --> 00:59:01,281
Did you hear?
This place will please us.

728
00:59:08,872 --> 00:59:10,623
Welcome to Wichita.

729
00:59:10,749 --> 00:59:11,958
Doc I'm Black.

730
00:59:14,711 --> 00:59:18,131
You are not in tune with the times,
with guns in this town, huh?

731
00:59:18,381 --> 00:59:19,424
Really?

732
00:59:21,468 --> 00:59:23,553
This is Wallace, Grand W,
sent you?

733
00:59:23,928 --> 00:59:27,349
By the way, my friend.
You wanted to see us here.

734
00:59:28,975 --> 00:59:30,060
That's good.

735
00:59:31,019 --> 00:59:34,147
I pay 1000 dollars
to do a job.

736
00:59:35,106 --> 00:59:37,359
It will use that.

737
00:59:38,401 --> 00:59:39,653
Are you interested?

738
00:59:41,696 --> 00:59:42,989
It interests us.

739
00:59:44,074 --> 00:59:45,492
I thought.

740
00:59:45,575 --> 00:59:47,202
You have drawn attention.

741
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:50,830
If the Sheriff sees you, you will remove the
before you can use them.

742
00:59:52,165 --> 00:59:53,500
I doubt it.

743
00:59:55,043 --> 00:59:56,294
Here's the money.

744
00:59:57,462 --> 00:59:59,422
I will give
when it's done.

745
01:00:00,965 --> 01:00:03,718
Do not think that I try
to teach you your job ...

746
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,096
... But I know better the situation.

747
01:00:06,221 --> 01:00:07,222
Go ahead.

748
01:00:07,889 --> 01:00:09,224
First, ...

749
01:00:09,432 --> 01:00:11,559
... One of you must remain hidden.

750
01:00:42,882 --> 01:00:45,802
- Sam, please.
- I'm sorry, honey.

751
01:00:46,302 --> 01:00:49,055
I have to stop this before
it goes too far.

752
01:00:49,431 --> 01:00:50,724
But why?

753
01:00:51,099 --> 01:00:53,601
Why can not you
resolve your differences ...

754
01:00:53,643 --> 01:00:56,855
... without involving Laurie?
She likes him.

755
01:00:56,896 --> 01:00:59,232
They are all against him,
not just me.

756
01:00:59,691 --> 01:01:01,860
It can not end
only one way

757
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:04,237
I do not want Laurie
either side of him at that time.

758
01:01:05,071 --> 01:01:06,197
The do you want?

759
01:01:11,494 --> 01:01:15,081
- Hi, Dad. We ...
- Between, Laurie. We'll talk later.

760
01:01:16,916 --> 01:01:18,460
- But, Dad ...
- I beg you.

761
01:01:22,005 --> 01:01:24,549
- Good evening, Wyatt.
- Goodbye, Laurie.

762
01:01:32,182 --> 01:01:34,684
I ask
not to see my daughter.

763
01:01:35,727 --> 01:01:37,812
You understand why, right?

764
01:01:38,438 --> 01:01:40,565
- Yes, I understand.
- Sheriff!

765
01:01:41,232 --> 01:01:43,526
- There is a gunslinger.
- Who is it?

766
01:01:43,568 --> 01:01:46,446
I do not know, but it is a revolver.
He saw the posters.

767
01:01:46,446 --> 01:01:47,489
Is he alone?

768
01:01:47,572 --> 01:01:49,574
Yes. He sits and drinks.

769
01:01:49,658 --> 01:01:51,660
All right.
Excuse me.

770
01:02:07,717 --> 01:02:08,843
It happens.

771
01:02:33,493 --> 01:02:34,661
Hi, Wyatt.

772
01:02:34,828 --> 01:02:37,414
Morgan. So you,
the great gunslinger?

773
01:02:38,206 --> 01:02:40,000
<i> - Where is Jim?
- Hi, Wyatt. </ I>

774
01:02:40,041 --> 01:02:43,044
I bring you a good customer.
You know him?

775
01:02:43,169 --> 01:02:45,296
Yes, I know.
What did he do?

776
01:02:45,338 --> 01:02:47,298
He has offered $ 1000
to kill you.

777
01:02:49,676 --> 01:02:53,471
If they are friends to you,
tell them that the joke is over.

778
01:02:53,847 --> 01:02:55,181
I have never seen.

779
01:02:55,223 --> 01:02:57,892
I believe you, Doc,
but they are not friends.

780
01:02:57,934 --> 01:02:59,185
They are my brothers.

781
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,189
Very clever.

782
01:03:04,107 --> 01:03:07,986
- Well, you already know my position.
- Here, you run out of position.

783
01:03:08,194 --> 01:03:09,946
You have one hour
to leave Wichita.

784
01:03:10,363 --> 01:03:13,074
- Help him for luggage.
- Certainly.

785
01:03:28,131 --> 01:03:29,132
Goodbye.

786
01:03:30,258 --> 01:03:32,844
Tell your brother that I will return.

787
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:35,930
In your place I will not.
Never.

788
01:03:54,908 --> 01:03:56,326
Well, let's go.

789
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:58,453
We can reach
the dark.

790
01:03:58,703 --> 01:04:00,622
And if Earp is not in the street?

791
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:03,917
It will be. It is a round
looking for problems.

792
01:04:04,042 --> 01:04:06,169
It will be on the street
or the newspaper.

793
01:04:06,878 --> 01:04:09,297
Perhaps tonight
there or elsewhere.

794
01:04:09,589 --> 01:04:11,174
Then we come back tomorrow.

795
01:04:12,008 --> 01:04:15,303
Remember, we will cross
the city slowly.

796
01:04:15,387 --> 01:04:17,514
It will be too dark to
that we recognize.

797
01:04:17,681 --> 01:04:20,308
If we do not see,
we return to the other side.

798
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:24,813
Let's go.

799
01:04:51,214 --> 01:04:54,259
- Hello, Miss McCoy.
- Hello. The Sheriff and there?

800
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:56,678
- Yes, I'll call.
- Thank you.

801
01:05:02,517 --> 01:05:05,145
Ah, Sheriff,
I would pick you up.

802
01:05:11,901 --> 01:05:14,321
Good evening. I went home.

803
01:05:14,446 --> 01:05:16,781
I know. Dad called you.

804
01:05:17,991 --> 01:05:20,160
Wyatt, what there was
between you two?

805
01:05:20,327 --> 01:05:21,536
It does not tell you?

806
01:05:22,787 --> 01:05:24,873
He only said
not to see you.

807
01:05:25,915 --> 01:05:26,958
Why?

808
01:05:27,083 --> 01:05:30,045
A difference of opinion
of Wichita.

809
01:05:30,754 --> 01:05:32,339
This is an explanation rather short.

810
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:36,301
It's long to explain
and I do not have time.

811
01:05:39,888 --> 01:05:40,930
Wyatt ...

812
01:05:41,514 --> 01:05:43,850
... which of you is right?

813
01:05:43,975 --> 01:05:46,645
This is not to be right,
but what is right.

814
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:52,776
Promise me that there will
no problems.

815
01:05:53,985 --> 01:05:55,570
I beg you,
Promise me.

816
01:05:56,863 --> 01:05:59,240
Come, I'll ride.

817
01:06:21,638 --> 01:06:23,765
- Hi, Andrew.
- Hello, Mary.

818
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:26,226
Give me your hat.

819
01:06:26,393 --> 01:06:30,397
Leave him a hand.
I will not stay long.

820
01:06:30,981 --> 01:06:32,774
What will happen, Andrew?

821
01:06:33,066 --> 01:06:37,654
I've never seen so irritated Sat
as against the Sheriff.

822
01:06:38,029 --> 01:06:41,366
- Why he hates so much?
- It is not hatred.

823
01:06:41,533 --> 01:06:43,034
It's not as simple.

824
01:06:44,661 --> 01:06:45,954
It is there.

825
01:06:54,004 --> 01:06:55,338
Good evening, Sat

826
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:57,048
Good evening, Andrew.

827
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:01,094
And your Sheriff?

828
01:07:01,594 --> 01:07:02,929
It happens.

829
01:07:05,223 --> 01:07:07,058
You know why I called you, right?

830
01:07:07,642 --> 01:07:09,060
Yes, Sam, I know.

831
01:07:10,145 --> 01:07:11,896
So you know what you do.

832
01:07:12,856 --> 01:07:15,150
- Yes, I know.
- Good.

833
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,529
Sit down, Andrew.

834
01:07:22,615 --> 01:07:24,576
Tell him to take his brothers
with him.

835
01:07:24,993 --> 01:07:27,162
I want them out by tomorrow morning.

836
01:07:28,121 --> 01:07:29,372
No, Sat

837
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:33,501
- What?
- I can not.

838
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:36,421
I see.

839
01:07:38,923 --> 01:07:41,384
We will also need
of a new mayor!

840
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:46,222
It's possible. Perhaps the citizens
are in agreement.

841
01:07:46,389 --> 01:07:47,891
You can be sure.

842
01:07:48,433 --> 01:07:49,809
Well, we'll see.

843
01:07:50,101 --> 01:07:52,520
It is 7 or 8 months
for the elections.

844
01:07:52,979 --> 01:07:55,690
You have time to look
another candidate.

845
01:07:55,857 --> 01:07:58,068
We will make special elections.
It is I who am the mayor.

846
01:07:58,109 --> 01:08:00,862
I was the only candidate, Sat

847
01:08:01,071 --> 01:08:03,198
I do not even need
program.

848
01:08:03,657 --> 01:08:05,033
Now I have one.

849
01:08:05,742 --> 01:08:06,993
The law and order.

850
01:08:11,831 --> 01:08:13,333
Good evening, Sheriff.

851
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:15,877
You wanted me to talk about Black Doc?

852
01:08:15,877 --> 01:08:18,171
Yes. How can you believe ... ?

853
01:08:18,171 --> 01:08:22,008
I did not have to be accountable
for expelling Doc Black in Wichita.

854
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:24,427
- Listen ...
- I've heard enough.

855
01:08:24,469 --> 01:08:26,513
I have a job to do
and I will.

856
01:08:26,638 --> 01:08:30,684
I will enforce the law and I will deal
my way those who violate.

857
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:33,561
- You understand.
- I'm not Black Doc.

858
01:08:34,396 --> 01:08:36,022
You can not threaten me.

859
01:08:36,064 --> 01:08:41,903
You are an ordinary citizen,
no special privilege.

860
01:08:41,945 --> 01:08:43,113
I see.

861
01:08:43,738 --> 01:08:46,324
Well, next time
I go out

862
01:08:46,783 --> 01:08:48,243
... I would have a gun.

863
01:08:49,786 --> 01:08:51,329
I'll wait.

864
01:08:54,749 --> 01:08:56,084
Sorry, Laurie.

865
01:09:01,881 --> 01:09:03,049
Sheriff, please.

866
01:09:03,508 --> 01:09:05,218
There is no other way?

867
01:09:06,094 --> 01:09:07,512
I'm afraid not, ma'am.

868
01:09:13,184 --> 01:09:14,352
There he is!

869
01:09:23,445 --> 01:09:24,487
Sam!

870
01:09:29,409 --> 01:09:30,702
Bring the horses.

871
01:09:33,121 --> 01:09:34,581
- Mary!
- Mom!

872
01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:37,000
Mary!

873
01:10:31,179 --> 01:10:32,472
Yes, three horses.

874
01:11:00,417 --> 01:11:03,545
- Come on, do not stop.
- What is your problem?

875
01:12:05,398 --> 01:12:06,816
Pull Wyatt Earp.

876
01:12:07,359 --> 01:12:09,611
Without it, others do not count.

877
01:12:56,032 --> 01:12:58,868
We need fresh horses
to continue.

878
01:12:58,910 --> 01:13:01,287
Do not worry.
It will be another day.

879
01:13:05,625 --> 01:13:08,128
- How are you, Jim?
- It does not matter. It is in the shoulder.

880
01:13:08,169 --> 01:13:11,548
Back to Wichita
to wait for those of W. Grand

881
01:13:11,548 --> 01:13:12,549
Do you think they will?

882
01:13:12,632 --> 01:13:15,010
They will come, yes.
We killed two of their men.

883
01:13:42,329 --> 01:13:43,538
Hello, Sheriff.

884
01:13:45,332 --> 01:13:47,459
How will Miss McCoy and his father?

885
01:13:52,005 --> 01:13:53,256
Hello, Wyatt.

886
01:13:59,054 --> 01:14:01,431
Miss Laurie,
I bring you breakfast?

887
01:14:01,473 --> 01:14:02,932
No, thank you, William.

888
01:14:04,351 --> 01:14:07,354
Laurie, I can do
something?

889
01:14:07,562 --> 01:14:10,774
No. But thank you for coming.

890
01:14:11,733 --> 01:14:13,026
I'm sorry.

891
01:14:15,195 --> 01:14:18,698
Wyatt! She has never
hurt anyone!

892
01:14:18,907 --> 01:14:21,076
I know, I know.

893
01:14:26,831 --> 01:14:29,584
- You come back?
- Yes.

894
01:14:30,251 --> 01:14:34,005
You must be tired and hungry.
I'll cook.

895
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:35,173
Thank you.

896
01:14:35,256 --> 01:14:37,634
But I want to talk with your father.

897
01:14:38,802 --> 01:14:40,387
He does not want to see anybody.

898
01:14:40,929 --> 01:14:43,640
It is with my mother
since last night.

899
01:14:44,557 --> 01:14:46,726
I have to say can wait.

900
01:14:46,851 --> 01:14:49,646
It will make furious
but it might do him good.

901
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:51,356
Maybe.

902
01:14:52,148 --> 01:14:53,692
It has to do with that shot?

903
01:14:53,817 --> 01:14:56,778
Yes. We had two.
The third escaped.

904
01:14:57,696 --> 01:14:59,864
This is where someone
your father's trust.

905
01:15:00,573 --> 01:15:02,742
- Who?
- Black Doc.

906
01:15:03,952 --> 01:15:06,329
But it was our friend!

907
01:15:06,413 --> 01:15:07,706
I know.

908
01:15:11,292 --> 01:15:12,794
It is not complete,
is not it?

909
01:15:12,877 --> 01:15:14,129
No, not yet.

910
01:15:14,129 --> 01:15:16,965
Now you know why
your father does not want to be seen.

911
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:19,384
Too many people I shoot.

912
01:15:20,844 --> 01:15:23,596
- But you will not give up.
- No.

913
01:15:24,723 --> 01:15:29,227
Never give up. Not as
things like that happen.

914
01:15:30,228 --> 01:15:32,439
It might take me a lifetime.

915
01:15:33,148 --> 01:15:36,609
And mine.
Because I will be with you.

916
01:15:39,321 --> 01:15:41,781
Come. I bring you your breakfast.

917
01:15:45,618 --> 01:15:47,579
They started shooting at us
when he saw us.

918
01:15:48,288 --> 01:15:51,333
They did not given
the opportunity to travel.

919
01:15:53,376 --> 01:15:55,086
Sure my brother is dead?

920
01:15:57,047 --> 01:15:59,466
Sure. And the other.

921
01:15:59,758 --> 01:16:01,885
They have put their more than ten bullets.

922
01:16:03,928 --> 01:16:04,971
I go to Wichita.

923
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:06,806
Anyone would come?

924
01:16:09,809 --> 01:16:12,646
Chief, he killed two of us.

925
01:16:12,729 --> 01:16:16,399
He was murdered.
You will let him get away?

926
01:16:17,859 --> 01:16:18,860
No.

927
01:16:18,985 --> 01:16:20,111
We are going with you.

928
01:17:41,609 --> 01:17:43,028
It's me they want.

929
01:17:52,537 --> 01:17:54,414
Take your men,
Wallace.

930
01:17:56,666 --> 01:17:59,461
What are you doing, Sam?
Two of my men died.

931
01:17:59,461 --> 01:18:01,171
We want those who killed them.

932
01:18:02,172 --> 01:18:04,215
Your men have killed my wife.

933
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:09,262
Sam, I do not know.

934
01:18:09,304 --> 01:18:10,680
Where is Doc Black?

935
01:18:11,556 --> 01:18:12,932
He did not come with us.

936
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,437
U-turn. We're going.

937
01:18:19,606 --> 01:18:22,776
- Well, Gyp.
- I came to kill a man.

938
01:18:22,817 --> 01:18:25,070
Forget it.
Your brother got what he deserved.

939
01:18:27,822 --> 01:18:29,074
Although the children.

940
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:40,794
Do not shoot to wound.
Or it is you who die and that's me.

941
01:18:40,919 --> 01:18:42,087
I know, Gyp.

942
01:18:42,712 --> 01:18:43,838
I'm sorry.

943
01:19:11,157 --> 01:19:12,617
Thank you, Mr. McCoy.

944
01:19:15,745 --> 01:19:17,247
We can shake hands?

945
01:19:17,956 --> 01:19:18,999
Of course.

946
01:19:49,571 --> 01:19:50,613
The bride and groom are coming!

947
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:22,145
I did everything that he does
not work in Dodge City.

948
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:24,939
Dodge is twice as bad
that Wichita.

949
01:20:25,148 --> 01:20:26,858
Not for him.

950
01:20:26,941 --> 01:20:29,611
And even if it were,
he must go.

951
01:20:30,028 --> 01:20:31,988
Yes, I guess so.

952
01:20:32,072 --> 01:20:34,157
Paps

953
01:20:34,532 --> 01:20:39,287
<i> he had a daughter
and he married her </ i>

954
01:20:39,829 --> 01:20:43,917
<i> she said of love
to his great fame </ i>

955
01:20:44,459 --> 01:20:49,047
<i> nobody plays
with the Sheriff of Wichita </ i>

956
01:20:49,506 --> 01:20:53,802
<i> and me
it is a beautiful town </ i>

957
01:20:54,386 --> 01:20:58,348
<i> there in Wichita </ i>

958
01:20:58,682 --> 01:21:03,311
<i> prevailing law and order </ i>

959
01:21:03,812 --> 01:21:08,358
Take me <i> Wichita </ i>

960
01:21:08,650 --> 01:21:14,239
<i> let me ride
on the trail of Wichita </ i>
