<i>Go ahead.
Dixon'll hear the shot.</i>

153

him and that Indian will have their guns...

stickin' through
both them windows.

155
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,655
Chances are, they'll
take you both back to Apache Wells...

156
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,494
<i>turn you over
to Ben Lattimore.</i>

157

<i>Or, then again,
theyjust might shoot you-</i>

158
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:42,704
Be done with it.

159
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,704
Don't let 'em
bluff ya, Jeb.

160
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,713
<i>I never bluff, sonny.</i>

161
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,978
I like life
just as much as you do.

162
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,219
Now why don't you just
give me that gun and let me load it?

163
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:12,567
We had a chance, and you-
you passed it up!

164
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,664
Now, now, now. There'll be-
There'll be others.

165
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:26,248
Why, you
old buzzard, you!

166
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:31,813
I don't like ridin' on rough roads
with loaded shotguns.

167
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,849
Sometimes they just
go off by themselves.

168
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:41,729
So I'll just keep ol' Betsy
pointed at you two...

169
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,734
in case that happens.

170
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,072
Now they were here yesterday,
but they're not here today.

171
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,415
Why?

172
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:05,479
Could it be that somebody might have
warned the marshal that I was coming?

173
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,722
Yup. Telegraph key.

174
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,856
Now he didn't take 'em
outta town on horseback...

175
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,991
so he must've used
the stage.

176
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,195
What stage, mister?

177
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:22,970
Well, now, I ain't at liberty to tell you
anything, Mr. Lattimore.

178
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,509
Now come on, now.
Put that thing away.

179
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:32,482
Unless I'm misinformed, you never shot
an unarmed man before.

180
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:35,850
Well, I never had any
cause to until now.

181
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,481
[Sighs]
Well, the marshal's my friend.

182
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,889
He told me not
to tell you anything.

183
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,427
Now if that's cause
for killin', go ahead.

184
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,861
Well, say I had shown up
unexpectedly.

185
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,263
Would you have helped
him stand me off?

186
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,632
Not me or anybody else.

187
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:55,434
We don't care how Jeb
and Johnny Sims die, just so they die.

188
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,737
Well, they got a lot
of friends in the territory...

189
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,800
friends that might help
them if they had a chance.

190
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,847
Now if I don't kill them,
they just may not die.

191
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:06,111
Well, now, I'll tell ya, their friends ain't
gonna get 'em outta territorial prison.

192
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:09,483
- [Laughs]
- Well, thanks.

193
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:13,285
- Did I say anything for you to thank me for?
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

194
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:16,521
Now, do you know of anybody around
here that's got a good horse for sale?

195
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:21,658
Mine's just about had it, and it's a long,
long ride to the territorial prison-

196
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,600
even if you know
the shortcut.

197
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,266
Let's get outta here, Dix.

198
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:07,538
That's my old man
over there, Marshal.

199
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,654
Horses gone. Old man dead.
Indian boys gone.

200
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,893
- You think they killed him?
- No. Good boys.

201
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,958
Take a look around
while I get a shovel.

202
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:34,369
- Too bad.
- He was a no-good old drunk.

203
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:39,638
- So? Leave him to buzzards.
- You don't do that to your old man, Piute.

204
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:45,105
Somebody please
help me down.

205
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:48,675
You stay where you are, ma'am.
We may have to get outta here in a hurry.

206
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,717
Any signs to tell ya
who might've done it?

207
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,386
No. Looks like they
wanted the horses.

208
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,952
Or maybe they didn't
want us to have 'em.

209
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,123
Dix, I know how you feel
about your old man...

210
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,190
but we gotta get outta here
fast, son.

211
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,259
I'm buryin' him,
and that's that.

212
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,166
Lady, I told you
to stay put.

213
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,712
Them that done this
might still be around.

214
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:17,407
Oh, dear. I didn't
think of that.

215
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:20,883
Since I'm down, I might as well
stay down, hmm?

216

- What on earth for?

217
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,324
Women have been known
to carry Derringers.

218
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:30,987
Hey, old man. You'd better search her,
she might have one in her bustle.

219
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:34,862
I have a good mind
to slap your impertinent face.

220
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:38,767
You stay away from them.
They kill women.

221
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:43,797
I wish now I'd stayed in Apache Wells
and turned them over to Ben Lattimore.

222
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,145
Much shooting. Much blood.
Many tracks.

223
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:01,022
White men's tracks.
I think Indian boys dead.

224
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,617
If you want,
I find bodies.

225
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:07,791
No. I just wanna plant the old man

Sorry, folks. You're gonna have to
walk for a while.

Otherwise, we'll never
make it up this grade.

242

for horses. Everybody walk.

I wish I could, ma'am,
but nobody lives there anymore.

When the gold ran out,
everybody pulled up stakes...

00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,778
I'm saving your lives
by taking them off the wagon.

302
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:19,322
Will you let us
get rollin'?

303
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,655
I've got a tired team here
and I got no place to go but back.

304
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,719
Come on along with us.
We can use your guns.

305
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:28,265
No, there's no use
talking to him.

306
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:31,790
He's so full of hate,
nothing else matters to him.

307
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:35,805
Let him go, Marshal.
He wants his blood, let him have it.

308
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:39,832
<i>He's beyond decency,
beyond reason.</i>

309
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:47,549
All right. The killing can wait.
Turn the wagon around. I'll ride with ya.

310
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:01,093
Come on, miss.
We got no more time to waste.

311
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:03,998
Too bad. Gunfighter's way
much better.

312
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:07,663
Maybe shotgun
go off by mistake, huh, Chief?

313
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:10,070
Both barrels.

314
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,507
Get aboard, you
bloodthirsty savage.

315
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,349
Stop up ahead up there.

316
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,304
Hold up there.

317
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:30,818
You know, nobody's been over
that road to Calico in a dog's age.

318
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:34,585
Why should they be?
Town's been dead for 40 years.

319
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,820
There's still plenty water,
feed and shelter up there.

320
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:39,192
I say it's a good place
to hole up.

321
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:43,256
I don't think that road back to Apache Wells
is going to be particularly safe tonight...

322
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,461
not with a team
that can barely walk.

323
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,771
What you suddenly
interested in us for, Ben?

324
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,308
I thought all you wanted to do
was to kill my prisoners.

325
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,401
That's still
the only interest I have...

326
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:56,844
but I still say
let's hole up in Calico.

327
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,944
What do you think, Dix?

328
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,646
Well, if I'm gonna get shot at,
I'd just as soon be inside.

329
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,689
There's nothing
to hide behind up here.

330
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,690
And he's right about the horses.
They're beat.

331
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:12,854
Well, I wish you'd thought of it
instead of Lattimore.

332
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,763
I've never seen a gunfighter
you could trust.

333
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,960
Nobody's asking you
to trust me.

334
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:20,503
I'm here
for only one reason.

335
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,869
Taken me a long time
to catch up with those two...

336
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,874
and I don't intend
to let them get away.

337
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:29,078
Well, maybe
what you're suggesting...

338
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:32,741
is just what those men who blew up
the bridge want us to do.

339
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,149
Maybe we're walkin'
right into a trap.

340
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:38,154
Traps are easy to see
in the daylight.

341
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:42,886
Besides, maybe, uh- maybe you've got
something here they don't expect- me.

342
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,329
You make the difference?

343
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:49,332
[Chuckles]
Why don't you ask your prisoners?

344
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:53,595
Turn me loose
and give me a gun...

345
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:57,163
and you'll be looking at the man
who killed Ben Lattimore.

346
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,379
I might just do that,
sonny.

347
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,471
One way or the other.

348
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:06,675
Won't make any difference
to the world.

349
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,115
All right, Dix.
Let's take this man's advice.

You never listen to me.

- Well, we'll talk about that later.
- Later?

Yak, yak, yak. Will you get her
out of here, Marshal?

bad enough...

to a gabby old woman.

You take it, ma'am.

I ought to be indignant,

00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,750
you have to be
suspicious of everybody.

it was ridiculous.

He's a worried man.

stay alive.

603
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:39,660
Well, if we threw out
our guns, maybe he will.

604
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:41,828
And then
it's up the rope we go.

605
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:46,998
I'm comin' out.

606
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:07,824
You'll have to go in
and get him, Lattimore.

607
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:09,831
He's a stubborn boy.

608

<i>[Johnny]
Nobody's hangin'me, gunfighter.</i>

609
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:16,897
When I die, it'll be
with a gun in my hand.

610
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,907
<i>[Ben]
That suits me.</i>

611
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:22,411
This afternoon you were gonna
turn me loose and shoot it out.

612
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:26,878
<i>- Still willing to?
- If that's what you want.</i>

613
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:30,876
I'll, uh-
I'll need a gun belt.

614
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:35,421
Ben, please.
Don't do it, Ben.

615
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:37,425
You'll have to
come and get it.

616
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:40,826
First, those guns you're packin'-
Pitch 'em out on the bar. Come on!

617
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,950
Where is it?

618
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:04,418
Over there on the chair.

619
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:13,695
This'll do just fine.

620
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:16,323
There's your gun.

621
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:38,752
Ben, he's only a kid.
You can't. It's murder.

622
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:41,756
Oh, he's a few weeks
older than he was...

623
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:44,156
when he killed my sister.

624
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:57,139
You're a plain
damned fool, Johnny.

625
01:07:59,008 --> 01:08:00,999
Yeah? Watch.

626

<i>[Sniffling, Crying]</i>

629
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:53,921
I walked out once.
I wouldn't have walked out again.

630
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:56,624
How was I to know it?

631
01:08:56,699 --> 01:08:59,167
There's a lot more blood
on my hands tonight.

632
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:02,870
There's blood on mine too.

635
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:18,546
Cheer up, Johnny.
They ain't hanged us. Not yet.

636
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:20,851
You think
more friends come?

637
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:22,891
You can't never tell.

638
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:27,292
Better not. Blow guts
out left hand same as right.

639
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:35,098
Ben, I don't make
mistakes very often...

640
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:38,629
but when I do,
they are beauties.

641
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:41,574
I was wrong about you.

642
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:45,910
If I'd have handed over the keys
to the jail to you in Apache Wells...

643
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:48,609
none of this would've
ever happened.

644
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:51,312
I don't think you would have
handed me the keys.

Piute, you keep
that shotgun cocked...

649
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:11,735
and pointed
in the right direction.

650
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:24,275
You take care of this.
