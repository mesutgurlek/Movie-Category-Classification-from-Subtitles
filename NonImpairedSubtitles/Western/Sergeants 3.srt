00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:00,751
I'm worried sick about her, myself.
I don't know what to do. She's really sick.

320
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:02,503
The vet been here, yet?

321
00:50:03,295 --> 00:50:07,466
Yeah. He said maybe it's some weeds
that she ate on the parade ground

322
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:11,261
and now she's got poison wind,
but that don't seem right

323
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:15,265
because I remember
she ate a whole field full of weeds once

324
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:18,560
and never acted like this.
I don't think the vet knows what to do.

325
00:50:29,655 --> 00:50:33,158
- An old Sioux remedy.
- A Sioux remedy?

326
00:50:33,492 --> 00:50:38,288
Herbs, mixed by the dark of the moon
by six medicine men.

327
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:41,166
Now, that ain't gonna hurt her none, is it?

328
00:50:41,959 --> 00:50:44,711
You know I wouldn't hurt Cephie.

329
00:50:54,054 --> 00:50:56,390
That's all you use? Just that little bit, huh?

330
00:50:57,057 --> 00:51:00,978
No, that's all you need.
You see, this is very strong.

331
00:51:01,436 --> 00:51:05,065
A little bit goes a long way.

Good girl, Cephie.

and join in?

338
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:08,063
so they can go through
the Manual of Arms?

339

or anything else?

Well, Sergeant, now that your party
is off to a good start,

I believe Mrs. Collingwood and I will leave.

- Won't you stay, sir?
- I think you'll have a better time

349
00:54:06,455 --> 00:54:08,916
- if we leave.
- Go ahead and dance. Enjoy yourselves.

two fellas? Couple of wallflowers?

Yeah, for old...

- Beautiful party, Miss Amelia.
- Oh, thank you.

Lovely party, Miss Amelia.

Well, thank you,
but we've got a great deal on our minds.

365

You know, about the expedition
that's coming up and all those things.

366
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:51,583
Well, you sure are lucky, Larry.
This is gonna be a rough one.

367
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:53,210
- Yes.
- Worse than the last one?

368
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:55,546
- By all means, yes.
- (GASPS) Larry told me all about that.

- We certainly are.

373
00:55:05,264 --> 00:55:07,724
But, you know, Miss Amelia,
I think he's absolutely right.

374
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:10,561
He should get out of this.
After all, he's an educated man

375
00:55:10,644 --> 00:55:12,229
who can look forward to better things.

376

I mean, he's not at all like Chip and I,
you know?

and hardships.

378

on old Larry, don't you think so?

379
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:26,201
Mike, I'm so glad to hear you say that.
And you're so right, isn't he, Larry?

380
00:55:27,202 --> 00:55:28,662
Well, dear? Isn't he?

381
00:55:28,745 --> 00:55:31,582
He's probably thinking about that cozy
little home you're going to have.

having understanding friends like this.

- Yes, very nice party.

391
00:56:05,073 --> 00:56:08,702
You see, Mike and me,
we've been meaning to talk to you.

392
00:56:09,578 --> 00:56:10,871
Talk to me?

393
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:15,125
- Sure. You see, you're staff and...
- We're horse barn.

And, you know,
we don't get a chance to see each other.

And I figure since we're gonna
be comrades, you know, together...

- True, Sergeant, true.

did you tell him about our secret?

You see, a few of the fellas,
we got together, we chipped in,

404
00:56:48,659 --> 00:56:54,665
and we took up a collection. We, sort of,
got some fine drinking whiskey.

472
01:02:38,258 --> 01:02:40,219
He had a gastric attack.

473
01:02:41,553 --> 01:02:42,554
Gastric attack?

474
01:02:43,514 --> 01:02:45,849
Sorry, ma'am
but he's got to report at once.

475
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:55,067
Larry? What is it? What does it mean?

476
01:02:55,317 --> 01:02:56,944
It means my two wonderful friends,

477
01:02:57,027 --> 01:02:59,196
my pals, can't seem to get along
without me.

01:02:59,279 --> 01:03:00,864
You're gonna have to go
on the expedition?

479
01:03:00,948 --> 01:03:03,325
- That's right.
- Oh, Larry.

480
01:03:03,575 --> 01:03:05,285
I knew they'd figure a way.

481
01:03:05,369 --> 01:03:09,540
- Do you mean Mike and Chip did this?
- Nobody else.

482
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:12,000
Well, Larry, that's outrageous!

483
01:03:12,042 --> 01:03:14,461
Well, dear, can't you do something
about it? Talk to someone.

484
01:03:14,545 --> 01:03:16,672
- Talk to the Colonel.
- That wouldn't do any...

485
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:21,635
Maybe it would.

486
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,097
Amelia,

487
01:03:26,098 --> 01:03:29,017
would you mind being in a town,
alone, with 36 men?

488
01:03:32,104 --> 01:03:35,524
No, Larry. Not if you're there.

489
01:03:35,941 --> 01:03:37,776
I'll be there.

490

Oh, Larry!

495

- I'm so glad to see you.
- I thought the days would never go by.

01:04:43,008 --> 01:04:45,010
- Ain't that cute?
- It's sickening.

Welcome to Medicine Bend.

It was a rough ride.

Gonna be a long night.

You just gonna stand around
and let her take him away like that?

No, no, no, no.
I've been looking all over for you.

to tell you.

- It's about the Wanagí Wacipi.

- Yeah?

- Get out of here, I've got work to do.

Work? Wait till you hear what I
gotta tell you, you'll forget about work.

- You know what?
- I know where they hang out.

we jump on our horses,

we ride out there and we creep in,
we grab them.

No more Ghost Dancers. No leaders.

No chain of command. No medicine man.
No Ghost Dancers. How about that?

Now, look, when we get this guy,

we bring him back here, right?
And we put him under heavy guard.

to the good old Colonel.

Come on, Mike, I'm serious.
Where's your patriotism?

559
01:10:17,843 --> 01:10:18,886
- Patriotism?
- Yeah.

560

Where did you get this cock-and-bull...

561

- You had help.
- Yeah, Jonah.

562
01:10:28,228 --> 01:10:30,397
- Jonah?
- And Caleb.

- Caleb?
- Yeah, they're friends.

564
01:10:33,901 --> 01:10:37,029
And Caleb is half Sioux.
And he's got a lot of cousins

565
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:39,740
up in the north country, you know?
They hunt and fish and trap

566
01:10:39,781 --> 01:10:42,951
and do everything. And one of his cousins
was telling Caleb that

567
01:10:43,035 --> 01:10:45,454
he saw all these guys
up in the high places, you know?

568
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:49,708
With the lights going and the yelling
and screaming. That's how he found out.

569
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:52,169
- And you believed it?
- Sure, I believed it.

570
01:10:52,211 --> 01:10:55,964
- You believe this stupid, idiotic rumor?
- Sure, I do.

571
01:10:56,798 --> 01:10:59,801
You mean, we just go, and we grab them,
and we bring them back,

01:10:59,927 --> 01:11:01,386
and we get the medals?

573
01:11:03,222 --> 01:11:06,183
Do you remember what the Colonel said
before we left the fort?

574
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:09,812
- What did he say?
- He said, "This is to be a garrison only."

575
01:11:09,937 --> 01:11:13,232
No fights, no sorties and no exceptions.

576
01:11:13,315 --> 01:11:15,275
Mike, this is an emergency!

577
01:11:15,818 --> 01:11:19,279
Look, go to bed.
Sleep it off and forget about it.

578
01:11:19,363 --> 01:11:20,405
That's an order.

579
01:11:22,157 --> 01:11:25,953
- It's an order?
- That's an order!

You may out-rank me a little bit
with all these here little fancy doo-dads,

but you're still nothing
but a lousy non-com.

582

- I'm in command.
- Well, don't give me that command stuff.

583
01:11:34,586 --> 01:11:37,381
You listen to me, Mike. If you don't do
anything about this, I'm going to,

584
01:11:37,422 --> 01:11:39,633
and there's nothing you can do to stop me.

585
01:11:40,342 --> 01:11:43,720
- I can put you in jail!
- Jail?

586
01:11:43,887 --> 01:11:44,972
- In jail!
- For what?

587
01:11:45,055 --> 01:11:46,682
Insubordination.

588
01:11:46,723 --> 01:11:48,475
- You really mean it, don't you?
- I mean it!

589
01:11:48,559 --> 01:11:51,061
- Insubordination?
- Insubordination!

590
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:52,521
Okay.

591

You got to get me out of here.

We'll go up
and get the Ghost Dancers ourselves,

604

and when we do, I'll out-rank him.

605
01:13:03,217 --> 01:13:04,551
Then will the Colonel let me enlist?

606
01:13:04,635 --> 01:13:07,054
Sure he will, sure he will.

607

We've got strict orders about you, Sarge.

- We've heard all about you, Sarge.

- We've been warned about you, Sarge.
- No, all you have to do is...

- Just...

What are you doing with that mule?

626
01:14:16,582 --> 01:14:19,585
Cephie and I, we're gonna get you
out of here. Now, you just back off.

627
01:14:19,668 --> 01:14:22,004
- Wait a minute.
- Back off, Sergeant Chip.

628
01:14:22,087 --> 01:14:23,380
We going to get you out, now you back off.

629

- I said back off.

633
01:14:35,767 --> 01:14:37,978
Get up there, higher now!
Come on back here.

634
01:14:44,359 --> 01:14:46,403
Nice one, Cephie. Let's get harder now.

635
01:14:46,737 --> 01:14:48,238
Got to get the Sergeant Chip out of there.

636

652
01:15:42,376 --> 01:15:43,710
Over here.

653
01:15:48,882 --> 01:15:50,926
Sergeant Chip, Caleb's got the gun,

654
01:15:50,968 --> 01:15:53,303
and the horses, your gun belt,
food and water and everything

655
01:15:53,387 --> 01:15:56,348
and two horses in the draw.
Come on, we got to get out of here.

01:16:03,856 --> 01:16:07,943
- The jail fell down?
- That's right, Mike.

658
01:16:08,026 --> 01:16:11,947
He's telling the truth, Chip is gone.

659
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:13,824
Why, that drunk!

660
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,702
- Do we pursue him?
- Bring him back?

661
01:16:16,785 --> 01:16:20,372
No, forget about it. If he's looking for the
Ghost Dancers, maybe he'll find them.

662
01:16:20,455 --> 01:16:22,416
They'll know what to do with him.

663
01:16:22,499 --> 01:16:23,750
Okay, on your way.

664
01:16:23,834 --> 01:16:25,752
You too, civilian.

665
01:16:50,027 --> 01:16:51,695
That's it. Hold it.

Oh, yeah.

670
01:17:32,528 --> 01:17:35,697
Well, how much farther we got to go?
This is the real end of nothing.

671
01:17:35,781 --> 01:17:37,950
Soldiers never come
this far along the river.

672
01:17:37,991 --> 01:17:40,202
Only, maybe, a few white trappers.

- Unknown country.
- It sure is.

674
01:17:44,665 --> 01:17:49,127
In the old days, many hunting
Sioux lived along the river.

675
01:17:49,211 --> 01:17:51,839
There is a high place
where the Sioux worshipped.

676
01:17:51,922 --> 01:17:54,925
- Well, that's what we're looking for, right?
- We'll find it.

677
01:17:54,967 --> 01:17:57,511
- Right?
- Right.

678
01:17:58,637 --> 01:18:02,141
What are we hanging around here for?
Let's get out.

679
01:18:11,316 --> 01:18:12,818
Come on, Cephie.

680
01:18:30,043 --> 01:18:31,879
We got to cross this thing?

681
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,714
Trappers and Sioux use it.

682
01:18:49,104 --> 01:18:51,023
Is this thing safe?

683
01:18:51,064 --> 01:18:53,192
It's been here 125 years.

684
01:18:57,029 --> 01:19:02,201
Jonah, you stay here with the horses.
Caleb and I will cross over and take a look.

685
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:05,287
- But Sergeant Chip...
- What is it?

686
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:07,831
Well, you remember what you said,

687
01:19:07,915 --> 01:19:10,501
that maybe the Colonel will let me enlist.

688
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:13,378
He won't let me do nothing if
you leave me here with the horses.

689
01:19:14,338 --> 01:19:16,048
Well, Caleb knows the way.
Now, what's the matter with you?

690
01:19:16,131 --> 01:19:17,758
You want to get us lost?

691
01:19:17,799 --> 01:19:20,969
Well, I know the way, too. Caleb told me.

692
01:19:21,053 --> 01:19:24,932
And besides, you promised me.

693
01:19:25,474 --> 01:19:28,685
What could I have promised you?
I didn't know what we were getting into.

694
01:19:28,769 --> 01:19:32,064
Now that sure is going
to mess everything up.

695
01:19:34,733 --> 01:19:38,487
Caleb, you think we could
find the way okay?

696
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:42,032
Yes, Sergeant.
Just follow the trail, you can't miss it.

697
01:19:43,617 --> 01:19:47,079
- All right, you're elected. Come on.
- Thanks, Sergeant.

698
01:19:52,626 --> 01:19:55,045
I'm right behind you, Sarge.

699

01:28:03,367 --> 01:28:06,161
- They got him.
- Who got him?

785
01:28:06,203 --> 01:28:10,582
The Ghost Dancers. They got him there,
and there's a whole bunch of them.

786
01:28:10,624 --> 01:28:11,875
I'll tell you something.
The only reason I got out

787
01:28:11,959 --> 01:28:14,378
was because of this here, and the mask.

788

They're going to kill him, Sergeant.

789

We'd better get moving, Mike,
so we can get him out of there.

Can you find your way back there again?

792

- Yes, Sergeant Mike.
- Get two horses ready.

793
01:28:23,762 --> 01:28:24,847
Yes, sir.

794
01:28:24,888 --> 01:28:27,141
- And get out of those silly clothes.
- Yes, Sergeant.

795
01:28:31,687 --> 01:28:34,648
Mike, you taking a detail?

796
01:28:34,731 --> 01:28:37,734
Detail?
The Colonel would throw the book at me.

797

Well, I'm going with you.

798

You trying to crawl back in the army,
Sergeant? We don't need you.

799

811
01:29:59,024 --> 01:30:00,734
Well, Chip's in trouble.
I got to help Mike find him.

812
01:30:00,818 --> 01:30:02,444

Of course, real live Indians.
What are you driving at?

816
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:12,704
Nothing. Just thinking about
Sergeant Boswell's gastric attack.

817
01:30:12,788 --> 01:30:16,750
- What has Sergeant Boswell's gastric...
- In a word, trickery.

818
01:30:16,792 --> 01:30:17,793
Trickery?

for one single minute that it is,

after all the things he's done to you.

after coming all the way out here?

If you would just listen.

No, I won't listen. You listen to me, Larry.

to come all the way out here.

don't get started back this morning...

Well, if you have to go looking for Chip...

Larry, if you go after Chip,
then that's the end for us.

- That's the kind of a man you want.
- What do you mean?

so sure about the trouble?

you want a mouse, and I'm not...

These men, who through their daring
and valiant action

972
01:50:43,435 --> 01:50:46,355
were able to warn this command
of an ambush

and thereby turn a possible annihilation
into a victory.
