1
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:18,666
This is my country,
This is where I was born.

2
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:22,629
The first 9 years of life
I spent in this Indian village

3
00:01:22,963 --> 00:01:26,467
with many of my mother's people, but
most important with my father.

4
00:01:28,177 --> 00:01:31,682
This man is my father.
This is like I knew him best.

5
00:01:32,808 --> 00:01:36,562
My Dad wasn't just one man named
Flint Mitchell he was a breed of men,

6
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:39,816
mountain man who lived
and died in America.

7
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,905
He use to tell me about these
men he knew

8
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,268
Men who walked the Indian trails and blaze
new one's for no men been ever before.

9
00:01:48,785 --> 00:01:50,704
Man who found lakes,
rivers and meadows,

10
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,124
Man who found paths to the west
and the western seas,

11
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,637
Who roamed Prairies and mountains and plateaus
that are now states ,

12
00:01:58,464 --> 00:02:01,100
Man who search for beaver
and found glory

13
00:02:02,343 --> 00:02:05,305
Man who died un named
and found immortality.

14
00:02:09,268 --> 00:02:11,229
My father always began story
by

15
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:13,815
telling me about meeting place
of the mountaineers,

16
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:17,027
This is where they met every July
after year of caraping in the Rockies.

17
00:02:17,778 --> 00:02:20,490
Here they cashed in their furries
caught up on their drinking,

18
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:24,620
In the fighting, in the gambling in the fun.
And the girls.

19
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:27,804
They lived hard and they played hard

20
00:02:30,794 --> 00:02:33,764
Winner is the man who gets the
most shoots on his mark in a minute.

21
00:02:35,064 --> 00:02:37,064
Ready
fire

22
00:02:38,678 --> 00:02:40,305
Shooting competetion was
not for marksmanship

23
00:02:41,056 --> 00:02:43,509
The competetion was for speed.
speed of reloading,

24
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:45,603
which was not easy
thing in those days

25
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:48,523
Powder and ball cap and,
ramp rod.

26
00:02:50,985 --> 00:02:54,664
A man's life of a mountain man's life
didn't always dependes on his hitting the target,

27
00:02:54,864 --> 00:02:57,759
depended on how fast he could get ready
for the next shot.

28
00:02:58,202 --> 00:03:00,204
If by accident he miss the first time,

29
00:03:00,663 --> 00:03:02,840
He have to be sure
he had a second chance.

30
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:08,943
Mr. Chennault, this gathering
is a unique in my experience.

31
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:10,607
Where they all come from?

32
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:13,003
Captain Lyon,they come from
beyond the maps.

33
00:03:14,096 --> 00:03:18,017
One of the strangers took my
My father's friends was Captain Lyon,

34
00:03:18,184 --> 00:03:20,729
He was a Scottish man, a veteran
of Waterloo.

35
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,142
He came to the Rockies with a double barrel gun
a whole suit of armor,

36
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,071
and a man who would paint pictures
of all that he saw

37
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,815
So that the captain would ever had
a record of his adventures.

38
00:03:33,494 --> 00:03:36,498
Yes, with pleasure.
But put him on now.

39
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:43,256
"Outside? Too bad.

40
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,552
- Mr. Chennault.
- No, no you does not drink.

41
00:03:52,892 --> 00:03:55,312
- Please Mr. Chennault.
- No.

42
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:58,524
You owe me money.
Do you have money to pay me?

43
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:02,445
- He knows I have nothing.
- Of course.

44
00:04:02,946 --> 00:04:06,367
Sorry. Forget it. I am
trader, I do charity.

45
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:08,661
What a unkind.
Among French ...

46
00:04:09,036 --> 00:04:12,040
All I ask is a cup,
What it costs?

- Yes, all: Pie Black, Nez Perce ...

52
00:04:51,128 --> 00:04:53,798

Do not forget, Mr. Chennault,

55
00:05:00,556 --> 00:05:02,142
That once i was a rich and influential man .

56
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:06,930
You might use him, Captain.
I could show you some good shooting.

57
00:05:07,231 --> 00:05:09,734
- Thank you, sir.
- What's your name?

58
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:15,998
Pierre Alphonse Marie Joseph Victorof Promusenne,
the Framboise.but you may call me Pierre

59
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:22,207
- Have a drink, Pierre.
- Oh, Captain.

60
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:48,230
This perticular summer my father was
buying horses and recruiting

61
00:05:48,364 --> 00:05:50,741
The best men to go with him to
the Blackfoot territory

62
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:55,230
A new and  rich country my father have to explore.
it was a lot of Beavers to be hang

63
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:57,166
And lots of beavers meant lots of money.

64
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,123
Have you see any better horses place captain

65
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:03,175
I find these very happy

66
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:07,470
This lady's name was Kamiah,

67
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,889
She was a full blooded Black foot Indian.

68
00:06:10,265 --> 00:06:13,227
She was proud, strong
and beautiful.

69
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:17,607
She's not a snake girl.
These Nez Perce bring her up mighty strict.

70
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:20,485
Oh well,
its only a small investment.

71
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:25,299
Hi
Hi

72
00:06:27,073 --> 00:06:28,073
Compliments of the season

73
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:36,689
Oh no,no,no
this some mistake

74
00:06:38,048 --> 00:06:40,134
Seven stars, willow ...

75
00:06:44,183 --> 00:06:45,183
I told you captain.

76
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:47,935
I am So, sorry,i beg your pardon
I had no idea.

77
00:06:57,613 --> 00:07:01,234
She wants to know, are you buying horses
to trade for a wife.

78
00:07:04,872 --> 00:07:05,872
No,

79
00:07:11,976 --> 00:07:13,076
Do you have a wife already

80
00:07:14,926 --> 00:07:15,926
No

81
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,122
She says it is foolish for a man who
can buy so many horses not to have a wife.

82
00:07:28,008 --> 00:07:29,408
Tell her about a pony of her's

83
00:07:38,787 --> 00:07:40,581
She says pony
goes where she goes.

84
00:07:43,845 --> 00:07:44,845
Go now.

85
00:07:57,132 --> 00:07:58,632
Look,Recain

86
00:08:08,142 --> 00:08:09,142
We missed you

87
00:08:12,244 --> 00:08:15,072
Recain was a Scotch man
who was the old trading partner of my father.

88
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:16,916
But Recain was now living
with the Blackfoot indians.

89
00:08:18,251 --> 00:08:21,638
He was tired of the hunting and killing
and he liked the Indians the way they lived.

90
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:26,052
Recain was a man with the strong heart
and strong convictions.

91
00:08:28,263 --> 00:08:31,267
Captain, this's an old friend of mine:
the Recain.

92
00:08:31,934 --> 00:08:34,729
- Recain? How Argyll?
- No, of McGregor.

93
00:08:36,022 --> 00:08:38,767
I've some whiskey i think you'll like.
"Mr. Chennault?

94
00:08:39,401 --> 00:08:40,401
Want to join us?

95
00:08:49,038 --> 00:08:52,125
- You too, Pierre.
- Me? Yes, thank you.

96
00:09:31,881 --> 00:09:34,551
- You don't like do that.
- No, I never did.

97
00:09:34,884 --> 00:09:37,930
- Gowie, do you think i can learn to blow this thing?
- No, that's not learning, its the gift.

98
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:41,517
There's nothing like the pipes for
war.i remember Waterloo.

99
00:09:42,018 --> 00:09:43,895
I been looking for another
moment like it ever since.

100
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:47,483
- Maybe in this Blackfoot country.
- Maybe.

101
00:09:49,193 --> 00:09:52,197
I've a notion this adventure of yours
will take all the money you have got.

102
00:09:52,823 --> 00:09:56,076
- I hate to see you lose everthing you saved
i've saved for this.

103
00:09:56,702 --> 00:10:00,165
I wish you take the money and live the
life where you born too in Kentucky.

104
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:01,539
Oh,i am not rich that yet.

105
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,587
I am going to the Nez Perce.
Have a good whiskey, Captain.

106
00:10:08,402 --> 00:10:09,402
What does he wants from Nez Perce?

107
00:10:10,385 --> 00:10:12,805
He's making a trade with looking glass
for girl's on pony.

108
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:16,643
- Recain? he's going to marry her?
- No, no.

109
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:19,785
He's going to take her back
to her own people

110
00:10:21,524 --> 00:10:24,277
- What you say! Black Is a Foot!
- What I tell you.

111
00:10:24,444 --> 00:10:26,655
- But listen ...
- No way.

112
00:10:26,822 --> 00:10:28,490
Wait a minute, Wait a minute.

113
00:10:28,907 --> 00:10:32,954
I beg you pardon,i was explaining to him She is not Black foot,
she can not be, she is the old looking glass daughter.

114
00:10:33,663 --> 00:10:36,842
No,no,no looking glass steal her from the
as black foot when she was a little girl.

115
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:39,253
- It's that simple.
- you sure that?

116
00:10:39,795 --> 00:10:43,466
Her grandfather is Bear Ghost,
black foot medicine cheif.

117
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:46,971
He all the time wants to get his granddaughter back
he ask Recain to come down and buy her.

118
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:51,059
Ghost Bear "? and he's the big medicine man
of the Blackfeet tribe.

119
00:10:51,768 --> 00:10:54,021
And this Iron
he's just a young war chief.

120
00:10:56,565 --> 00:10:58,985
And Ghost Bear is the big man
in that beaver country .

121
00:11:02,114 --> 00:11:03,908
Go and Tell Dick to get everything out
we got to trade.

122
00:11:04,325 --> 00:11:06,703
Flint you can't do that.
You can not just go and buy the girl.

123
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,880
Why can't i?

124
00:11:07,954 --> 00:11:10,165
There's one thing for Recain
take her back to her own people.

125
00:11:10,457 --> 00:11:13,669
But looking glass won't trade her to you
No,he will expect you to marries her.

126
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:15,807
I would've except to my seft

127
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:21,345
She can't do to me any harm.
and she might do me lot of goog.

128
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:28,753
Tell looking glass

129
00:11:48,304 --> 00:11:50,304
Looking glass's hut is on the ground.

130
00:11:50,922 --> 00:11:53,634
He loves his black foot daughter
he would be very sad without her.

131
00:11:54,301 --> 00:11:56,721
- How much more is that going to cost?
-you make him steepy bribe.,

132
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,517
She's a sun and moon to him.

133
00:12:00,658 --> 00:12:02,358
Well tell him that my heart is on the ground

134
00:12:02,478 --> 00:12:06,065
Because i can not give him the sun
and the moon to take the place of his black foot daughter.

135
00:12:07,108 --> 00:12:09,695
But as much as Recain his offered
I've offered more.

136
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,363
But trade is a trade.

137
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,425
His heart is bleeding.
Recain is his friend

138
00:12:28,926 --> 00:12:31,587
The mountain is his friend,
he can not give his daughter to both.

139
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:35,288
Well make up his mind between this thing.

140
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:39,981
It is not like the chief of the Nez Perce that will have
to sun go down on thinking what the matter is this.

141
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:53,539
Recain says that if looking glass
will returns his daughter to our black foot grandfather,

142
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:58,493
he Recain will try to make peace between the
Blackfeet and Nez peirce good thing for both

143
00:12:58,962 --> 00:13:02,049
Well tell looking glass if Recain
is a man of his word. he must do what he says .

144
00:13:10,643 --> 00:13:12,561
Looking glass think that peace
is very good thing,

145
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:17,225
but he's an old man and very poor and he
have many greedy relatives.

146
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,433
Go get it.

147
00:13:46,102 --> 00:13:50,065
Tell him King George's captain brought this
warrior's medicine, all the way from the land of his fathers

148
00:13:50,772 --> 00:13:52,672
Its very old and very strong

149

It is not affraid of arrows
and it is good against relatives.

150
00:14:46,596 --> 00:14:47,796
He will speak to his daughtr.

151
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:57,020
He can not give it to you
unless she say yes.

152
00:14:57,645 --> 00:15:00,774
If she says that she will marry to you,
then they may ready.

153
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,445
When you enter,

160
00:15:52,544 --> 00:15:54,255
You know i came down to
take her back to her own people.

161

I'll take her back my self. they want
a make trade for her ,i'll trade.

162
00:15:59,094 --> 00:16:02,390
She won't do you any good. you never
get in that country again.

163
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,320
No,
doesn't it anything matter to you?

164
00:16:08,226 --> 00:16:10,026
Yes.Trafic

165
00:16:22,038 --> 00:16:24,249
The four couples
forward and back ...

166
00:16:27,461 --> 00:16:29,046
Say hello to the girls
before you go.

167
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:34,887
Make it spin.
Ahead, across and back.

168
00:16:35,513 --> 00:16:37,598
Repeat and return
to the previous position.

169
00:16:41,979 --> 00:16:46,150
Back to you, the prettiest.
Repeat the same step and a walk.

170
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,662
Make her turn with pace and swing,
make her turn and returns to the circle.

171
00:17:06,716 --> 00:17:08,552
Eight hands up and round.

172
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,930
Still round and round
never let go.

173
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:15,143
Leave your old lady
to make her a trade.

174
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,563
Take the new
and tries to kiss her ...

175
00:17:36,627 --> 00:17:38,212
into the trap beavers
look at you dancing.

176
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:43,552
The groom in the center. Takes
a glass of Mountain Dew,

177
00:17:59,488 --> 00:18:01,240
Shake hands with this beauty.

178
00:18:01,407 --> 00:18:03,576
Find your companion
and come back to the ring.

179
00:18:22,474 --> 00:18:24,393
Beg your pardon sir,
is this a private fight?

180
00:18:24,852 --> 00:18:26,562
- No, help your self.
- Thank you, sir.

181
00:20:48,565 --> 00:20:51,652
- Entrez, to lattaque.
- What did he say?

182
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,197
Come, fear nothing.
Entrez, a l'attaque.

183
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,637
Entrez, a l'attaque.

184
00:21:39,835 --> 00:21:42,380
Lord! Enough!

185
00:22:02,142 --> 00:22:03,142
What she said?

186
00:22:02,695 --> 00:22:04,740
- She said?
- you're drunk.

187
00:22:05,928 --> 00:22:06,928
And by God you're drunk.

188
00:22:20,091 --> 00:22:22,553
-Hey hell you're sclaping me.
- Yes

189
00:22:27,267 --> 00:22:28,852
- It's cold.
- Yes

190
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:41,581
What's that?
Perfume.

191
00:22:42,284 --> 00:22:45,372
- You put that stuff on me?
- No, I drink it.

192
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:53,047
Mr. Flint, you know
all about the mountain,

193
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,093
but you know nothing
about the women. not yet.

194
00:22:56,552 --> 00:22:58,304
But you will learn ... maybe.

195
00:23:43,473 --> 00:23:44,473
What's the matter?

196
00:24:10,223 --> 00:24:14,395
Trappers HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
HERE THE 4TH JULY NEXT YEAR

197
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:18,858
RUN FOR THE VOICE
Chennault MOUNTAINS

198
00:24:28,745 --> 00:24:33,198
That was called the brigade
this thin brow line of 30 people and 75 of animals.

199
00:24:33,918 --> 00:24:38,006
They were spare horses and pack mules
loaded with traps, food,clothing

200
00:24:38,173 --> 00:24:41,177
ammunition. regular
cargo included courage.

201
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:41,374
These thin trees were the 1: boundry
of the Blackfoot tcountry.

202
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,254
Explorers went forward
to look and learn and die.

203
00:25:52,614 --> 00:25:53,614
Let's get out of here.

204
00:25:53,847 --> 00:25:55,474
- What about Luke?
- 10 minute no good for luke.

205
00:26:06,737 --> 00:26:09,491
This young Blackfoot Prince
was named Iron Shirt.

206
00:26:10,158 --> 00:26:13,829
They him trappers like my father were
intruders and enemies to be hunted and killed.

207
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:17,166
Iron Shirt have the idea
that this was his country,

208
00:26:17,417 --> 00:26:19,169
and he wanted it kept that way.

209
00:26:23,335 --> 00:26:25,035
We will have a  good big fight
you know.

210
00:26:26,928 --> 00:26:30,599
Clear. we
This Iron Shirt he will jump us sure.

211
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:35,939
I know you long time

212
00:26:36,898 --> 00:26:39,944
This is first time you stop and think
why do you fight Blackfeet.

213
00:26:47,661 --> 00:26:49,831
Your women maybe she
make back for you.

214
00:26:50,123 --> 00:26:52,417
Shut up,doubles
the guard tonight.

215
00:26:54,044 --> 00:26:56,088
I'll made up my mind What i am
going to do, I'll tell you.

216
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:35,135
Ask Kamiah if she knows
another path into the Blackfoot country.

217
00:27:35,468 --> 00:27:38,889
Not the big north war road, but a quick way
a small parties might use.

218
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:54,408
When the Nez Perce stolen
her ,

219
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:57,620
from her people They bring her over mountain
very fast.

220
00:27:58,334 --> 00:27:59,734
Does she think,she can take us over.

221
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:12,058
If you want to go
she will take you.

222
00:28:13,764 --> 00:28:15,934
We want to go.
Let's go tell Du Nord.

223
00:28:16,267 --> 00:28:18,395
- I'm staying here.
- No, come on.

224
00:29:50,505 --> 00:29:52,507
Dad use to tell me that
he was all for glad

225
00:29:52,883 --> 00:29:55,302
That he only have to make
that trip over the mountains once.

226
00:29:56,804 --> 00:29:59,265
They were forced day marches
through trackers timber.

227
00:29:59,641 --> 00:30:02,227
hot,dry days
and bitter cold nights.

228
00:30:03,395 --> 00:30:05,314
Montana had not been named yet.
no Idaho

229
00:30:06,816 --> 00:30:09,736
These men had only the faith that
this wilderness would end,

230
00:30:09,903 --> 00:30:11,488
But the next mountain would be
the last one to be cross,

231
00:30:12,782 --> 00:30:15,910
and then the green pleasant
valleys would appeared at last.

232
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:19,331
But always there seems to be another range
to cross,

233
00:30:20,165 --> 00:30:23,211
and another. And ever
higher and colder.

234
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:51,453
- What is that mule carried?
- Two sets of traps.

235
00:32:17,306 --> 00:32:21,185
These stars. i could reach up
and touch them with my hand.

236
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,996
It was a snow drift
but the heart beat no one knew.

237
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,834
If the horses get through?
No one knew.

238
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:45,548
They going forward  seem doubtful,
but going backward seemed impossible.

239
00:33:55,047 --> 00:33:57,050
Her people call it
"In light of the mountain."

240
00:34:25,292 --> 00:34:29,213
She say: "Here I was born,
this is my country. "

241
00:34:29,672 --> 00:34:33,593
The sun that gave it to my people.
gave them the earth, sky and water.

242
00:34:34,433 --> 00:34:35,633
I never saw anything like it.

243
00:34:36,681 --> 00:34:39,058
The best beaver country in the world.

244
00:35:52,062 --> 00:35:53,856
Some day i'll
lot pull you good .

245
00:36:07,122 --> 00:36:10,084
Their arms were strong, and their axes
were sharp and timber abundant .

246
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,381
Soon they built a stockade
strong, tall and white.

247
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,635
They lived trapped.

248
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:20,888
Here the skins were stretched, dried
and packaged.

249
00:36:30,024 --> 00:36:33,529
- So you've made the picture going?
- Yes sir, but the meaning is unkown to me.

250
00:36:34,113 --> 00:36:36,699
- Blue Grass.
- It's I was born there.

251
00:36:37,825 --> 00:36:41,020
Who,which it to be a sort of family history,
it begins with a coat of arms.

252
00:36:41,663 --> 00:36:44,458
Your husband's bear:
Blue Grass.

253
00:36:46,085 --> 00:36:48,088
And yours, bear.
there.

254
00:36:57,557 --> 00:37:00,060
The bear, the bear is her grandfather.

255
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,620
Ask her if she remember her grandfather?

256
00:37:06,068 --> 00:37:08,153
Ask Kamiah
if she remembers her grandfather.

257
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,796
They call him Bear Ghost because old
man grizzly gave him much power,made him very wise

258
00:37:26,258 --> 00:37:27,844
Ask if her if she knows
where is he now.

259
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,732
In this time of era he go to
hotsprings in Three hills .

260
00:37:44,989 --> 00:37:49,077
She wants to know does your grandfather go
to hot springs

261
00:37:49,244 --> 00:37:51,080
this time of era
in Blue Grass?

262
00:37:51,247 --> 00:37:55,293
My grandfather? No.
the indians killed him in Virginia.

263
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:01,759
Well,i must be getting my beauty sleep.
Come on Gowie.

264
00:38:11,646 --> 00:38:14,650
Tell Kamiah that I'll to go up in the morning.
we're gone for two nights may be.

265
00:38:29,469 --> 00:38:30,469
here is your elk's teeth.

266
00:38:31,378 --> 00:38:33,047
You can Play with these
while I'm gone.

267
00:38:37,802 --> 00:38:40,514
No, you will stay right here
and keep your shirt ont.

268
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:56,783
For next few days, my father
hunted for beavers with Du Nord one of our best tracker

269
00:38:57,784 --> 00:39:01,513
Dad was busy, tracking beavers but at the same
Time he kept looking around for any signs

270
00:39:01,597 --> 00:39:05,252
to see if the Indians were looking for him
in a same way as he was looking for beavers.

271
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,940
What's scared you little fellows?

272
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:47,018
Trees lie over they fall

273
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,596
And men
were buried where they died.

274
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:54,102
Du Nord, fathr's companion, was buried
with arrows still in his back.

275
00:40:32,856 --> 00:40:34,859
"Run?
No, I can't run.

276
00:40:37,153 --> 00:40:39,489
Saying run for your life had
a meaning in those days.

277
00:40:40,157 --> 00:40:42,493
If you get out ran Blackfeet than you
did have your the life.

278
00:40:43,703 --> 00:40:46,540
But that's all you had to face
the mountains, and wolves.

279
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,368
Iron Shirt  had every reason
to believe that the forest

280
00:43:36,701 --> 00:43:38,662
or wolves had killed
my father.

281
00:43:39,413 --> 00:43:41,540
And so he decided to strike
at the fort.

282
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:45,921
The first step was to steal as many of
the horses that he could get away with.

283
00:44:05,694 --> 00:44:07,780
Hadn't i fool
didn't even got a shot.

284
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:18,919
-It was Iron Shirt.
- Yes

285
00:44:19,836 --> 00:44:23,090
Horses gone!
Blackfoot.

286
00:44:29,473 --> 00:44:31,642
Mother got mad,
Indian mad.

287
00:44:38,817 --> 00:44:41,320
She's gone to tell her grandfather
to get the horses.

288
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:42,950
Now i've got to tell the boss.

289
00:44:45,784 --> 00:44:48,412
My father was not only escaped
the Indians, but he escaped the wolves.

290
00:44:49,029 --> 00:44:50,529
When he came home he heard the news.

291
00:44:51,207 --> 00:44:53,043
The loss of horses
bothered him,

292
00:44:53,152 --> 00:44:55,838
but my mother running out
really broke the axe.

293
00:45:25,745 --> 00:45:26,845
I'm going in.

294
00:45:27,042 --> 00:45:28,919
- You'll need these, sir.
- Come on.

295
00:46:33,266 --> 00:46:34,266
What he say?

296
00:46:35,947 --> 00:46:36,947
What he say?

297
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:40,922
He can see that you are her husband.
No doubt.

298
00:47:10,332 --> 00:47:13,419
My father told me that for the
first time he saw these Indians

299
00:47:13,586 --> 00:47:17,215
as he has never seen them before:
as People with homes,

300
00:47:17,757 --> 00:47:19,468
traditions
and ways of their own.

301
00:47:20,427 --> 00:47:24,314
suddenly they were no longer savages.
They were people who laughed,loved and dreamed.

302
00:47:31,758 --> 00:47:34,694
He said the last Star has killed
a buffalo. It invites us to a feast.

303
00:47:42,495 --> 00:47:44,623
He says that Iron Shirt has bringing new horses
in tomorrow morning .

304
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:52,382
Tell Bear Ghost
that I am obliged to him.

305
00:48:02,561 --> 00:48:06,607
When Bear Ghost was young he thought only
of war killing his enemies taking their horses.

306
00:48:11,196 --> 00:48:14,492
Their sons were born they became
strong young men. They pleased his eyes.

307
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:24,170
But they all killed in war.
one bye one.

308
00:48:30,678 --> 00:48:34,057
And longed to see his granddaughter
before his eyes close,on earth and sky.

309
00:48:47,143 --> 00:48:48,143
His people have a say

310
00:48:49,492 --> 00:48:52,287
Not found his
happiness without women. "

311
00:49:02,675 --> 00:49:04,844
Iron Shirt have
three good reasons for being mad.

312
00:49:05,261 --> 00:49:06,971
1. Flint Mitchel
was still alive.

313
00:49:07,681 --> 00:49:10,893
2, He was a guest of
Bear Ghost , the chief.

314
00:49:11,143 --> 00:49:15,906
3.And may be the most important:
iron shirt was going to have to get back those horses.

315
00:49:17,108 --> 00:49:20,696
- What did he say?
- There is blood on the ground between you.

316
00:49:23,575 --> 00:49:25,327
Tell him he talks like a crazy dog,
soldier.

317
00:49:26,061 --> 00:49:28,664
If he would shake my hand
it is out to him. If not ...

318
00:50:09,463 --> 00:50:13,050
- He will go back now.
- Tell Bear ghost he has made my heart warm,

319
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,596
but my tp will not be warm
untill he is come to visit us .

320
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:36,996
When Recain returns from
his hunt,Bear Ghost

321
00:50:37,163 --> 00:50:40,542
will ride with Recain to visit
his granddaughter and her husband.

322
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:02,401
He says may you go safe
while travelling far.

323
00:51:03,277 --> 00:51:07,240
May you both live long and love
each other,we will all meet and happy again.

324
00:51:52,211 --> 00:51:54,171
What is mika kah?

325
00:51:59,094 --> 00:52:00,929
- Where were you born?
- In kentucky ...

326
00:52:04,233 --> 00:52:05,633
I was born In kentucky

327
00:52:06,811 --> 00:52:09,940
In the Blue Grass. In the country
where the grass is blue.

328
00:52:11,066 --> 00:52:14,654
- Blue Grass?
- Blue Grass.

329
00:52:17,783 --> 00:52:21,204
- Blue Grass.
- That's it.well i've to go now.

330
00:52:26,357 --> 00:52:28,657
Come here
You want the teeth

331
00:52:30,089 --> 00:52:34,261
Pidgeons there are not enough riffels and traps
to get you all the trinkets you want.

332
00:52:53,118 --> 00:52:54,118
Oh good morning madam

333
00:53:00,501 --> 00:53:02,169
Would you mind testing my stew?

334
00:53:26,365 --> 00:53:29,953
Oh..I see.
You cook, I paint.

335
00:53:30,647 --> 00:53:31,747
Blue grass,Blue grass

336
00:53:33,832 --> 00:53:35,709
My words ?
you speak English?

337
00:53:40,157 --> 00:53:43,302
They helping hunt for Elk
Dad took with him Roy Du Nord,

338
00:53:43,844 --> 00:53:46,681
Who was brother of Baptiste
who had been killed few days before.

339
00:53:47,473 --> 00:53:49,935
Roy wanted to see where
his brother have been buried.

340
00:53:50,168 --> 00:53:53,522
Having seen the grave
he made his own private promise of revenge.

341
00:53:56,059 --> 00:53:58,570
You made a best shot to
pay on that Elk i ever saw

342
00:54:02,479 --> 00:54:03,579
Do you mind if i keep the teeth.

343
00:54:05,265 --> 00:54:06,265
For the women?

344
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:33,940
Winner is comming.

345
00:54:38,076 --> 00:54:40,704
- Snow soon.
-plenty of snow.

346
00:54:40,904 --> 00:54:44,792
We will have to move winter quarters pretty quick.
Your grandfather have told me of a good place.

347
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:47,545
May be we could talk him and spending
winter with us.

348
00:54:55,597 --> 00:54:58,725
"North? No.no
they aren't going north they're going south.

349
00:55:05,442 --> 00:55:07,528
Oh, when they go north again?

350
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:28,219
What? A boy, a son?

351
00:55:34,685 --> 00:55:36,687
Hear hear,put that down,
let's somebody else do that.

352
00:55:41,068 --> 00:55:43,738
Well,that's the way you feell,
its your work, its your work.

353
00:55:47,158 --> 00:55:50,329
- Mr. flynt Bear Ghost  sending us signals.
- What does he say?

354
00:55:55,293 --> 00:55:58,046
He will meet you
when the sun is highest in the sky.

355
00:56:00,049 --> 00:56:03,261
- Fine,Tell him we have great news.
- Yes, sir.

356
00:56:15,259 --> 00:56:18,559
get out my red coat Dick,yes sir
we won't do any more trapping today to north.

357
00:56:18,755 --> 00:56:21,700
We will put on a parade.
let me have all the men spare from camp.

358
00:56:30,193 --> 00:56:31,962
I'll give this Bear Ghost
to myself .

359
00:57:51,766 --> 00:57:55,770
Tell Bear Ghost my heart is warm
because he is come to visit his grandaugher and her husband.

360
00:57:56,006 --> 00:57:57,006
I meet him with a gift

361
00:58:42,408 --> 00:58:43,408
Take him back to the fort.

362
00:59:02,141 --> 00:59:04,519
Just a few months before, my father
was worried only about

363
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:07,189
What this might have meant and terms
of Beavers skins.

364
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:09,810
But now there was something more

365
00:59:11,903 --> 00:59:13,947
He was looking at the man who was died.

366
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:16,701
And this man
had been his friend.

367
00:59:17,794 --> 00:59:20,914
-There's anything i can do?
- Not now.

368
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:30,181
You know Iron Shirt is Chief now.
i know

369
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:12,392
We will spend the winter here.
Iron Shirt is their cheif now. that means trouble.

370
01:00:14,178 --> 01:00:15,178
Snow is comming pretty soon,

371
01:00:16,815 --> 01:00:19,609
That will keep him quiet
but don't count on it.

372
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:21,987
Don't go out alone,
we'll have the parties..

373
01:00:22,712 --> 01:00:24,412
We're going to get that spring Beaver.

374
01:00:24,899 --> 01:00:27,660
And when Iron Shirt shows up
we will be ready for it.

375
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:32,082
- Richardson. you take over place
of Du nard. "Yes, sir.

376
01:01:30,235 --> 01:01:33,364
My father often told me
that that  December 25.

377
01:01:33,781 --> 01:01:37,953
was the first time it ever been
aware of Christmas ,and what it really meant.

378
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:35,897
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

379
01:03:31,046 --> 01:03:33,675
Hurray for the summer session.

380
01:03:36,052 --> 01:03:37,638
And the rum!

381
01:03:39,407 --> 01:03:40,407
Pack him up

382
01:03:41,549 --> 01:03:42,849
Let the birgade fight order today.

383
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:45,814
Sign a big war party,
across the fort at center.

384
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:50,987
Let's pack, guys.

385
01:05:28,687 --> 01:05:32,775
You're full of magic.the
one woman in the world for me.

386
01:05:35,873 --> 01:05:36,873
I love you pigeon

387
01:05:38,216 --> 01:05:41,577
May be I did not know when I found you,
but I know it know.

388
01:05:44,114 --> 01:05:46,375
You can't understand
what I'm trying to tell you.

389
01:05:48,085 --> 01:05:52,257
And I don't understand very much
you say. Someday, may be.

390
01:06:05,999 --> 01:06:09,569
And now the brigade was on the way
back.back to assembly point.

391
01:06:10,421 --> 01:06:13,282
And now pack mules with heavy with
furs.

392
01:06:14,984 --> 01:06:19,456
It was my first trip to roundtabo
but i was hardly old enough to aware of it.

393
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:13,588
Indians.

394
01:08:15,246 --> 01:08:16,246
Indians.

395
01:14:21,433 --> 01:14:24,119
Its all right little chip.
all right.

396
01:14:33,338 --> 01:14:37,427
Kamiah
1830 WIFE OF MITCHELL FLINT

397
01:15:04,817 --> 01:15:05,817
You push on with us now.

398
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,299
The old looking glass will have
a woman to look after the young.

399
01:15:11,235 --> 01:15:13,803
She wanted to be
with her own people.

400
01:15:23,449 --> 01:15:27,737
Here, sir. some sugar for a little 
boy. very good food.

401
01:15:34,038 --> 01:15:35,038
I go with you.

402
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,708
No, not this time, Pierre.

403
01:16:09,787 --> 01:16:13,640
And so we went away from that place
where my mother left,just my father and i

404
01:16:14,685 --> 01:16:18,214
He belonged to the indian country now
with heart and soul.

405
01:16:19,941 --> 01:16:22,636
Now he helped open the west
for new trappers,

406
01:16:22,753 --> 01:16:24,972
For the men who loved
the country as he did,

407
01:16:25,173 --> 01:16:27,892
New outposts and civilization
new understanding.

408
01:16:29,052 --> 01:16:32,481
He wanted me to with him, but as
grew up he began to bother his consiousness

409
01:16:32,665 --> 01:16:35,151
I was not getting into schooling.
he wanted me to have

410
01:16:35,627 --> 01:16:38,697
He didn't realize,as i do now,
that no schooling of body and charactor

411
01:16:39,197 --> 01:16:41,784
could eaqual
those early years with him in wilderness.

412
01:16:42,318 --> 01:16:45,079
He taught me things that you
don't learned in school.

413
01:16:46,031 --> 01:16:48,959
And yet he felt that
I should be going back to east

414
01:16:49,168 --> 01:16:52,922
To prepare my self for some sort of what
he called a respectable life.

415
01:17:05,013 --> 01:17:06,513
A sound of that door closing.

416
01:17:08,607 --> 01:17:10,652
was like a door
closing on my life.

417
01:17:23,459 --> 01:17:25,586
My pony was fast
and I knew how to ride it.

418
01:17:26,754 --> 01:17:28,465
Dad looked at me and smiled.

419
01:17:37,843 --> 01:17:40,729
He agreed that my learning and
 doing could wait untill next year.

420
01:17:41,581 --> 01:17:44,150
Each year before year i was able to
 talk him out of it.

421
01:17:44,209 --> 01:17:46,987
And those years
were the happiest of my life

422
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:50,950
because i was old enough to then
to know my father, to understand it.

423
01:17:51,492 --> 01:17:54,079
and have him tell me 
what I have told you.

424
01:17:55,247 --> 01:17:57,207
His story is more than
story ,

425
01:17:57,658 --> 01:17:59,794
It is the story of
the mountain man,

426
01:18:00,628 --> 01:18:04,508
of the giants who walked
the west and became part of out history.
