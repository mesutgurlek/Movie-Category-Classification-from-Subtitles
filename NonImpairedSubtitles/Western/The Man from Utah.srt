1
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,400
Martial...I was just gonna apply for a job.

2
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,500
Its all right son. My deputy just gone down
there with all the men we need.

3
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,200
What's all the trouble, Martial ?

4
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,700
Who is he ?

5
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,300
Boys, get that man. I want him.

6
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,300
Wait a minute. I will get him.

7
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,300
Watch this fella.

8
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:21,465
Well Martial, I guess you got me ...
but I was not mixed up with that gang

9
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,829
...I was trying to help you.
-You darn fool.. I noted.

10
00:06:26,014 --> 00:06:27,702
I just wanted to talk to you
when you lead out.

11
00:06:28,675 --> 00:06:31,725
I got a job for you
and it ain't fighting fire with others.

12
00:06:33,116 --> 00:06:37,001
Say, I been looking for a fellow
that can shoot, ride like you for months.

13
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:41,047
Think I am going to let you get away ?
No Sire...

14
00:06:42,393 --> 00:06:43,714
Take a look at this.

15
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:03,323
-What's wrong with that ?
-Nothing maybe ..

16
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:09,338
it might be funny to me that every time
this gang organizes Rodeo

17
00:07:10,002 --> 00:07:11,807
...their own men win all the first prizes.

18
00:07:12,896 --> 00:07:15,851
Once it begins to look like an outsider
was going to win, he gets sick..

19
00:07:16,693 --> 00:07:18,058
two or three has even died from it.

20
00:07:18,808 --> 00:07:21,568
-cannot arrest them for that, Martial.
-no, maybe not.

21
00:07:22,213 --> 00:07:25,865
... but its mighty peculiar ...
that when all these outsiders fall

22
00:07:26,135 --> 00:07:30,745
fall off from them tough horses suffering
from snakebites. I tell you it ain't natural.

23
00:07:32,011 --> 00:07:33,547
what do you want me to do, get snake bit ?

24
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:38,952
No, my idea is for you to trail over there
and sign up for the Rodeo.

25
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:42,905
I will come along after
and do some private investigating.

26
00:07:43,518 --> 00:07:45,102
...while you work in on the gang.

27
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,797
cause you don't have to know me
when we get there.

28
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:50,906
-what do you say to that son ?
-sounds great to me.

29
00:07:51,697 --> 00:07:53,184
-when do we start ?
-right away.

30
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,650
this game is getting pretty hot for us.

31
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:03,630
If we are tiring the law to figure out
something crooked with this whole Rodeo business

32
00:08:03,948 --> 00:08:06,630
they will start investigating.
Now I will decide when we make our next clean up

33
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:08,505
right here in Dalton.
head for the border...

34
00:08:08,505 --> 00:08:09,449
before something happens

35
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:13,427
we will stick up the next stage of the mine
grab the rodeo receipt, and clear out.

36
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:17,967
you are right spike. they acted mighty suspicious
when that fella died over the boulder

37
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:20,259
-when do we start ?
-Tomorrow.

38
00:08:20,976 --> 00:08:24,872
Dolores will board the stage, down at sagebrush
and give you boys a high sign when the money is aboard

39
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,855
women passengers as a stage crew
ain't liable to fight much anyhow

40
00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:04,483
.well, well Cramer.
meet my new deputy John Weston.

41
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,583
I want you to paddle west with the shortcut trail

42
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,539
the one that leads to Dalton.

43
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:16,617
save him a whole days journey, if he
had to go on the way over the desert.

44
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:19,596
give him a horse. I will see
that another is sent to you.

45
00:09:20,205 --> 00:09:22,153
-sure thing.
-you better get going then, right now.

46
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,516
the trail starts outside the corral,
cant get off of it.

47
00:10:57,383 --> 00:10:59,811
then you go 14 miles
straight through the mountain

48
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,543
that will drop you right out of the timber
on the main stage road that leads to Dalton.

49
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:33,165
Howdy Miss Carter,
going home for the big round up ?

50
00:11:33,547 --> 00:11:36,767
-Oh yes! I promised Dad that I will be there.
-I bet, he will be mighty glad to see you.

51
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,732
I will be glad to see him too.

52
00:11:47,772 --> 00:11:54,658
-Pardon me. Do you mind if I sit on this side?
-Well, certainly not. Its quiet alright.

53
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,351
looks like we are getting some help
from back there.

54
00:15:40,235 --> 00:15:43,657
you sure got us out of the jam,
that time stranger. nice riding.

55
00:15:45,371 --> 00:15:47,213
you don't happen to be going
to the Dalton Rodeo... do you ?

56
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:51,552
-Yes I am.
- Well tie your horse on behind and ride in with us.

57
00:15:52,402 --> 00:15:53,463
thanks, I will do that.

58
00:16:20,228 --> 00:16:22,619
that was very fine of you
to come to our rescue.. Mr.. ....

59
00:16:23,369 --> 00:16:25,482
Weston Mam.
John Weston from Utah.

60
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:27,636
I came over for the rodeo ...

61
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:30,971
...I saw your distress signal
from the top of the ridge..

62
00:16:31,668 --> 00:16:34,921
when I saw all those men riding behind,
I thought I better come down and investigate.

63
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:37,372
-My distress signal ?
-it was mine.

64
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:39,907
I saw the men coming and waved for help.

65
00:16:40,894 --> 00:16:44,093
that was kind of an unusual place
to expect help, wasn't it ?

66
00:16:44,594 --> 00:16:48,110
-I saw you on the ridge.
-Oh, I see.

67
00:16:52,973 --> 00:16:56,676
-Are you going to Dalton mam ?
-Yes, I am Margaret Carter.

68
00:16:57,347 --> 00:16:58,350
...my father is Judge Carter.

69
00:16:58,645 --> 00:17:00,038
president of the county news bank of Dalton...

70
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:03,022
I want you to meet him when we get there.
he will want to thank you too.

71
00:17:03,461 --> 00:17:05,943
You see the bank had a
large shipment of money on this stage.

72
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:15,982
Yeah. there were about 50 of them.
but this fella from Utah comes along single-handed

73
00:17:16,481 --> 00:17:20,236
and knocks them all off the horses.
I have never seen such riding.

74
00:17:21,092 --> 00:17:22,485
can you tell me where I can find Weston ?

75
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:25,738
-Just went in the bank there, Mr. Carter.
-Thank You.

76
00:17:31,545 --> 00:17:33,265
Hello Miss. Carter.

77
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:36,547
This is Mr. Weston.. the man who
saved us from the bandits.

78
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:38,536
Mr. Weston. my father ...Judge Carter.

79
00:17:39,055 --> 00:17:42,192
mighty fine piece of work, young man.
I hope you are staying in Dalton.

80
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,379
-Yes. I am going to enter the rodeo.
-that's fine.

81
00:17:46,054 --> 00:17:49,042
Drop into my office after you get settled.
I like to have a talk with you.

82
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:50,791
thank you, I will be glad to.

83
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:03,975
-you cant blame me if your men
cant take care of him.

84
00:18:04,461 --> 00:18:07,114
she is right. just out-smarted you that's all.
I don't like the looks of it.

85
00:18:07,656 --> 00:18:09,793
he came up behind us and
took the boys off there horses.

86
00:18:10,249 --> 00:18:11,930
he said he will enter the rodeo.

87
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:15,257
-we are going to have to take care of him.
he is liable to spoil our plans.

88
00:18:20,591 --> 00:18:23,592
-hey, young man.
-hello Judge.

89
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:25,617
-come in.
- thank you.

90
00:18:26,226 --> 00:18:27,659
Miss Carter !
- How do you do ?

91
00:18:34,244 --> 00:18:38,246
as justice of the peace of this township,
I have been doing a little investigating.

92
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:42,974
and it appears to me that this rodeo gang
ain't just not exactly on the level.

93
00:18:43,991 --> 00:18:47,928
if it ain't, we are going to need all the good men
we can get on the side of law and order.

94
00:18:49,043 --> 00:18:52,547
it would be mighty disastrous son,
if anything happens to this rodeo.

95
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:55,700
nearly all the money in this valley
is tied up in it.

96
00:18:56,215 --> 00:18:58,060
... so we just got to keep it honest.

97
00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:00,809
you mean to say that these people
have tied up all the money in the valley

98
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:03,151
on a proposition put on by outsiders ?

99
00:19:03,624 --> 00:19:05,080
yes, every cent.

100
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:08,272
they think that it will bring people
and prosperity to Dalton.

101
00:19:09,068 --> 00:19:11,053
and they are all mighty proud of this little valley.

102
00:19:12,264 --> 00:19:14,444
that's why I am offering you
the job of Deputy Sheriff.

103
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:21,737
I figure, that with a man like you representing us
they wont dare to pull any of their tricks.

104
00:19:22,503 --> 00:19:26,104
well, I appreciate your confidence in me Judge,
but I couldn't accept.

105
00:19:26,763 --> 00:19:30,459
it will interfere with my plans.
- plans ! what plans ?

106
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:38,288
My plans to enter the rodeo, tomorrow.
- Oh ! I see. Well I am sorry young man...

107
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:42,390
so am I judge.
Good day Miss Carter.

108
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:52,294
- I am afraid I was talking to the wrong man.
- I think he is nice.

109
00:21:23,757 --> 00:21:25,332
Ladies and Gentlemen !

110
00:21:26,187 --> 00:21:30,694
it gives me great pleasure to announce
the first annual Dalton rally roundup.

111
00:21:31,565 --> 00:21:32,850
two days of Bronc riding

112
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:36,273
... consisting of riding, roping 
and horsemanship

113
00:21:37,114 --> 00:21:40,644
featuring Dynamite,
the only unridden horse in the play

114
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,364
better be careful son.

115
00:21:43,243 --> 00:21:45,384
many of them have lost their lives
making up with this thing.

116
00:21:46,228 --> 00:21:47,854
Oh, I don't think they will try anything today.

117
00:21:48,587 --> 00:21:50,627
by tomorrow, I may have this thing
figured out for you

118
00:21:51,027 --> 00:21:53,478
I hope so,
but I still say you ought to be careful.

119
00:22:05,514 --> 00:22:07,029
next on the program,
ladies and gentlemen ..

120
00:22:07,362 --> 00:22:08,710
will be the trick roping contest.

121
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:10,799
featuring Jack Hollister.

122
00:22:36,931 --> 00:22:40,120
the next event ladies and gentlemen
will be the roman standing race.

123
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:07,281
next ladies and gentlemen we introduce the world-renowned holder of all championships

124
00:23:08,118 --> 00:23:11,748
...Cheyenne Kent and the cub roping contest.
let her go !

125
00:23:42,978 --> 00:23:47,869
new record in this contest, ladies and gentlemen..
Kent's time was 15 seconds flat.

126
00:24:22,286 --> 00:24:24,969
its a brave try
but Kent's record still stands.

127
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:30,914
however we have a dark horse with us today.
A man from Utah will try his luck.

128
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:32,706
let him loose !

129
00:24:57,011 --> 00:24:58,450
a new world record, ladies and gentlemen!

130
00:24:59,103 --> 00:25:02,879
the man from Utah rode and tied his cub
in 14 seconds flat.

131
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,242
that one got away!

132
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,399
...better luck next time...

133
00:25:41,469 --> 00:25:46,208
that's 3 events taken in a day, the one
from Utah ! he looks like holding to me.

134
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,241
yeah! we got to do something about it.

135
00:25:48,863 --> 00:25:50,878
I don't want to pull anything too rough
unless we have to.

136
00:25:51,623 --> 00:25:54,366
Kent, you take the boys up into the cabin
and Dolores will get him up there.

137
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:56,743
just work over him gently.

138
00:25:57,453 --> 00:26:00,332
leave that for us.

139
00:26:33,495 --> 00:26:35,262
-are you ready ?
-let her loose.

140
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:57,467
Dolores, the young girl that you met on the stage
was in the gang from the beginning.

141
00:26:58,105 --> 00:27:00,074
play up to her
and see what you can find out.

142
00:27:00,904 --> 00:27:02,423
I will meet you in the saloon tonight.

143
00:27:33,996 --> 00:27:36,151
that concludes today's event,
ladies and gentlemen.

144
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:39,136
Don't forget, tomorrow is the big day.

145
00:27:45,535 --> 00:27:50,576
-Oh, you were wonderful.
-thanks Miss. that means lot coming from you.

146
00:27:52,961 --> 00:27:55,798
I like you to come to the house for dinner tonight.
I told father that

147
00:27:56,202 --> 00:27:59,434
maybe you can get you to reconsider the offer.
we need somebody like you.

148
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:03,278
Oh, Mr. Weston. It was wonderful
the way you win today.

149
00:28:04,121 --> 00:28:07,725
my brother is a big Rodeo star also.
and he would like to meet you.

150
00:28:08,247 --> 00:28:11,286
..wont you come now ?
- well .... I ....

151
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:19,926
Yes.

152
00:28:21,095 --> 00:28:23,161
goodbye Miss. Carter!
I will see you tomorrow.

153
00:28:36,792 --> 00:28:39,384
-here they come Kent !
-you boys get out at the back.

154
00:28:48,949 --> 00:28:50,418
this is my brother, Cheyenne Kent.

155
00:28:51,293 --> 00:28:53,795
-how do you do Kent.
-pleased that you have accepted our hospitality.

156
00:28:54,702 --> 00:28:58,671
-sit down, Dolores will fix us a drink.
-thanks.

157
00:28:59,859 --> 00:29:02,000
I must say that I watched your show today
and thought you were great.

158
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:04,505
well you did some mighty fine work yourself.

159
00:29:07,884 --> 00:29:09,991
-full on !
-no thanks. I don't drink

160
00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:17,729
well, here's looking at you !

161
00:29:30,867 --> 00:29:36,368
well Weston, tomorrow is the big day
now that you would ride in with us.

162
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:12,478
he got away !

163
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:20,336
we have to go tell Boss about this.
and he will be plenty sore.

164
00:30:29,942 --> 00:30:32,514
hey sheriff, the gang just jumped me
up at the Spanish woman's house.

165
00:30:33,703 --> 00:30:35,877
I got a hunch that if you go up there,
you can pick up some of the gang

166
00:30:36,196 --> 00:30:38,214
that were mixed up at the
stage coach hold up yesterday.

167
00:30:38,854 --> 00:30:41,801
yeah ? well you don't get look to me
like that you have been in any fight

168
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,722
you don't get me out of here
on no wild goose chase either.

169
00:30:45,298 --> 00:30:47,138
I am staying right here to guard this money.

170
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:51,390
-suit yourself.
-oh Utah! I got some prize money for you..

171
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,516
-that's a lot of money there judge ?
-yeah. we are doing pretty well.

172
00:31:02,537 --> 00:31:05,009
taken in 8.000 dollars today,
and expecting more tomorrow.

173
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:08,285
we will have close to 30.000 dollars
in this bank, by tomorrow night.

174
00:31:08,944 --> 00:31:11,833
30.000 dollars,
- you are taking an awful chance, aren't you ?

175
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,240
I am still guarding this bank, young fellow.

176
00:31:16,021 --> 00:31:19,660
pardon me Sheriff !
thanks judge.

177
00:31:24,118 --> 00:31:25,262
hello Miss Carter !

178
00:31:44,225 --> 00:31:49,425
Hey Buddy ! ain't you the whooper snapper
that won most of the events out there today ?

179
00:31:50,014 --> 00:31:52,008
-I wont appraise it that way.
-sit down.

180
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:56,660
hey, you look like the young fellow
that won the belt at Cheyenne, last summer.

181
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:58,412
no that was my grand dad.

182
00:31:59,392 --> 00:32:03,418
I have been nosing around. seems to me
that we will have to give this fellow Burton.

183
00:32:04,384 --> 00:32:07,164
after what you have done today,
he will probably be glad knowing you.

184
00:32:08,258 --> 00:32:11,423
get on the bar and make a bet on yourself
you lookie up.

185
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:13,275
well alright!

186
00:32:15,213 --> 00:32:16,700
if you cant fix him off,
then I have to buy him off.

187
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,008
if you are wrong with your work
I will use my brain.

188
00:32:19,768 --> 00:32:22,853
that boy put it over on you twice.
fine bunch you are.

189
00:32:25,142 --> 00:32:26,932
guess who is just talk out there.
he just came in.

190
00:32:27,449 --> 00:32:29,326
-fine, I will take care of him right now.

191
00:32:34,685 --> 00:32:36,733
-what it will be ?
-wanna place a bet?

192
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:40,330
a 1000 dollars, on Weston to win.

193
00:32:48,848 --> 00:32:49,912
he is on 1:2. favor.

194
00:32:50,757 --> 00:32:52,828
that's right
but its an easy 500.

195
00:32:53,536 --> 00:32:57,176
Beg pardon ! you are Weston aren't you ?
my name is Burton ...

196
00:32:57,699 --> 00:32:58,745
...I am head of the rodeo committee.

197
00:32:59,463 --> 00:33:02,056
-I would like to talk to you privately.
-certainly Burton.

198
00:33:11,826 --> 00:33:14,964
I want to apologize for the little over incident
that my boys had with you.

199
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,862
they thought you were somebody else.
they found out their mistake and they are sure sorry.

200
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:24,037
...I would like to have you meet them.
fact is I like to have you join up with us Weston.

201
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:28,177
you will never get into the big money in this game
unless you play with a gang.

202
00:33:28,851 --> 00:33:32,510
I guess you know what I mean.
- well it sounds good to me.

203
00:33:33,416 --> 00:33:34,934
I have always heard
that you have to be on the inside

204
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:37,761
...to be anything.
what's your proposition?

205
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:41,037
just this, right now you are 1 to 2 in favor.

206
00:33:41,804 --> 00:33:44,649
that means you are going to win
on a 1000 dollars bet, 500 dollars.

207
00:33:45,681 --> 00:33:49,152
seems for you to do is to let me
place 2000 for you on Kent's 2:1.

208
00:33:49,971 --> 00:33:55,443
and if you should be off form tomorrow
and Kent wins,

209
00:33:56,684 --> 00:33:58,407
you stand to make 4.000 dollars.

210
00:33:59,484 --> 00:34:03,616
now that's a lot better than 500 dollars isn't it ?
- I am glad that you are right.

211
00:34:04,112 --> 00:34:05,944
that's fine, I am glad that you can see it our way.

212
00:34:07,231 --> 00:34:09,071
come into the back room.
I want you to meet some of the boys.

213
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:20,895
boys, Weston here is going to join up with us.
I want you all to treat him right.

214
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:25,005
- Weston meet Cheyenne Kent.
- I think we have met before.

215
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:27,395
-signore Weston,

216
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:30,524
we will see a lot of each other,
now that we are friends.

217
00:34:31,245 --> 00:34:33,787
I am kind of agreeing at this racket,

218
00:34:34,275 --> 00:34:37,760
I suppose there are a lot of things
over this rodeo business that you can tell me.

219
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:41,985
-well Boys, see you later.
so long Burton. -so long.

220
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,141
-well just make that 2.000 on Weston.

221
00:35:12,707 --> 00:35:16,019
see boys, it just takes a bit of brains
to handle a guy like that.

222
00:35:17,022 --> 00:35:19,148
yeah.. how do you know
that he wont cross yourselves ?

223
00:35:19,512 --> 00:35:21,153
well, if he does
then we can still get him with the needle.

224
00:35:21,778 --> 00:35:23,193
we are cleaning up all this after this one anyhow.

225
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,411
-what did you make out son?
-you had the right hunch Martial.

226
00:35:31,008 --> 00:35:33,667
Burton is the brains in the gang alright.

227
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:36,077
I placed the bet like you told me ...

228
00:35:38,341 --> 00:35:40,105
he made me a proposition to join them outfit.

229
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:43,172
-did you accept ?
-sure, I accepted.

230
00:35:45,647 --> 00:35:48,769
he took me right in to introduce me
to the rest of the gang. I met them all.

231
00:35:51,408 --> 00:35:55,314
Burton told me that he place 2.000 dollar bet
on Cheyenne Kent for me.

232
00:35:56,486 --> 00:36:01,869
and if I should lose the event that
I was entered in, I stand to win 4000 dollars.

233
00:36:03,247 --> 00:36:06,845
so I don't think that we have much to worry
about them, till I start to winning.

234
00:36:07,994 --> 00:36:10,106
and then it may be too late for them
to get organized.

235
00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:15,504
I don't know son.
strikes me, you better be mighty careful.

236
00:36:16,727 --> 00:36:17,987
remember what happened to them
the other fellas.

237
00:36:19,185 --> 00:36:21,410
this gang tough bunch
when somebody crosses them.

238
00:36:22,731 --> 00:36:24,361
I don't want to see you
take down with snakebite.

239
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:30,001
you get anything out of the Spanish woman ?
-no, she wouldn't talk much.

240
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:34,648
she took me up to that shack on the hill
and introduced me to Cheyenne Kent.

241
00:36:36,004 --> 00:36:37,502
she said, he was her brother.

242
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,348
and before I can get into
some understanding..

243
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:45,942
the whole gang jumped me and I had to
curve myself up fast and walking.

244
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,710
I didn't get you into this job
to get yourself killed.

245
00:36:49,569 --> 00:36:52,272
-you got any ideas how they
work the snakebite proposition ?

246
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:57,039
not yet, but figuring from their past performances
I  cant do much till the bronc riding.

247
00:36:57,693 --> 00:37:01,670
that's one of the last events tomorrow.
so I will have till the end to figure it out.

248
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:07,827
and besides its going to take them sometime
to get wise that I am not gonna lose this rodeo.

249
00:37:08,902 --> 00:37:14,688
- never forgive myself if anything happens to you.
- nothings gonna happen

250
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,808
-come on lets turn in.
-tomorrow is the big day.

251
00:37:37,194 --> 00:37:40,947
I want to announce in time that the high man
from yesterday's events was the man from Utah.

252
00:37:41,784 --> 00:37:43,480
...Cheyenne Kent is the runner up.

253
00:37:43,893 --> 00:37:45,139
and it looks like a close race.

254
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:49,035
in the events for today, the contestants
will contest

255
00:37:49,606 --> 00:37:53,966
riding, roping and bull dogging, ending in a
thrilling demonstration of horsemanship.

256
00:37:54,418 --> 00:37:58,952
and both the man from Utah and 
Cheyenne Kent will try their luck on Dynamite.

257
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,047
may the best man win !

258
00:38:03,669 --> 00:38:05,420
and for the first time
ladies and gentlemen..

259
00:38:06,106 --> 00:38:10,225
...you will see the Indians from
the Daltons reservation... Zaenìte

260
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,172
let her go.

261
00:38:43,145 --> 00:38:44,907
they are sure going to give it to you today.

262
00:38:46,005 --> 00:38:47,211
do you think you got it doped out..

263
00:38:47,831 --> 00:38:49,991
I don't know for certain, 
but I gotta good hunch

264
00:38:50,492 --> 00:38:53,866
- you better not take any chances.
- its the only way to get the dope on them

265
00:38:54,567 --> 00:38:56,029
say, you got that snakebite medicine.

266
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:59,791
- sure, plenty of them.
- that's what I will try

267
00:39:00,355 --> 00:39:01,823
here take this out there with the needle.

268
00:39:03,868 --> 00:39:06,211
what are you thinking about son ?

269
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:11,997
on my mind, I think I got this thing figured out.
come on I am on the next event.

270
00:39:14,074 --> 00:39:19,605
next is the bull dogging ladies and gentlemen
watch closely, this is going to be good

271
00:41:07,873 --> 00:41:11,363
Cheyenne Kent will try to keep bulldogging record.
let her go.

272
00:41:28,932 --> 00:41:31,433
his time was 13 second, the best so far.

273
00:41:32,748 --> 00:41:34,755
John Weston, the man from Utah is next up.

274
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,030
I got to leave Mergeree.
the receipts are in by now.

275
00:41:40,632 --> 00:41:42,022
I have got to take them over
and put it in the vault.

276
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,424
that was another one
from the man from Utah folks.

277
00:42:08,314 --> 00:42:12,266
he beat the best time by 2 seconds.
or 11 seconds flat.

278
00:42:17,946 --> 00:42:19,341
we got to stop that guy right now.

279
00:42:20,223 --> 00:42:21,787
if he wins the bronc riding we are licked.

280
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:25,114
when that double crosser comes up 
for the bronc, you boys get the needle.

281
00:42:25,506 --> 00:42:27,163
and make it strong ..
and now get going.

282
00:42:53,825 --> 00:42:56,960
ladies and gentlemen Cheyenne Kent
will attempt to ride Dynamite.

283
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,162
unridden for 3 years.
let her go.

284
00:43:52,741 --> 00:43:54,973
- everything all fixed up for me boys ?
-its all yours !

285
00:43:56,205 --> 00:43:58,819
maybe I better sit into one saddle myself
to make sure.

286
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,737
you will find everything alright.

287
00:44:04,568 --> 00:44:08,554
ladies and gentlemen, the man from Utah
will try his luck on Dynamite.

288
00:44:09,804 --> 00:44:10,746
ride him cowboy !

289
00:44:13,045 --> 00:44:14,763
just a minute.

290
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:48,931
let him loose.

291
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,431
man from Utah on Dynamite !

292
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,980
that guy is wise. he found out about the needle
and now he is riding the bronc.

293
00:45:10,985 --> 00:45:13,030
we better get moving. we clear out the bank
and get over the line.

294
00:45:13,872 --> 00:45:15,736
-what about me ?
-that's for you to figure out.

295
00:45:47,772 --> 00:45:50,694
he rode him ladies and gentlemen.
he rode him ! what a ride.

296
00:46:04,134 --> 00:46:05,839
-Senor Weston !
-what's the matter ?

297
00:46:06,527 --> 00:46:09,026
Barton and his boys are holding up the bank
and they have left us behind.

298
00:47:13,222 --> 00:47:15,177
-put up your hands !
- well sheriff.. I ...

299
00:47:16,211 --> 00:47:18,893
robbery and murder eh ?
well you didn't get away with it.

300
00:47:19,648 --> 00:47:22,583
I thought you acted kind of suspicious last night 
when you were looking over that money 

301
00:47:23,154 --> 00:47:25,222
...and tried to get me out of there.
-but.. Sheriff !

302
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:26,730
save your breath young fellow.

303
00:47:41,404 --> 00:47:43,560
just a minute sheriff...

304
00:47:45,121 --> 00:47:47,911
...I am United States martial
that young fella was working for me.

305
00:47:49,092 --> 00:47:52,488
we were after a gang of rodeo crooks
and you almost let the biggest one getaway.

306
00:47:53,155 --> 00:47:55,252
now I gotta organize a posse
and go after him.

307
00:50:13,045 --> 00:50:14,867
nice work son, come on boys
take him out.

308
00:50:16,816 --> 00:50:18,191
boy you got them red handed.

309
00:50:18,752 --> 00:50:23,315
that's not all, here's enough evidence that can
send that gang up for murder.

310
00:50:25,251 --> 00:50:28,369
whenever anyone interfered with their rodeo plans
they stuck one of these needles.

311
00:50:29,205 --> 00:50:30,836
dipped in snake venom in the saddle.

312
00:50:31,755 --> 00:50:35,197
that's how the men died and 
why we couldn't prove any of them....

313
00:50:35,901 --> 00:50:40,692
...I knew there was a mystery about this bunch.
by jolly, it took you to figure it out.

314
00:50:43,726 --> 00:50:46,728
well you see Miss Margaret, its like this,
he had to play up to that gal

315
00:50:47,229 --> 00:50:48,530
...so he can get in with the gang.

316
00:50:49,903 --> 00:50:52,917
well, in that case I will have to forgive him.

317
00:50:54,605 --> 00:50:56,955
say young fella, 
how about the deputy sheriff job ?

318
00:50:57,923 --> 00:50:59,542
sorry judge, but I cant accept.

319
00:51:00,638 --> 00:51:04,421
-it will interfere with my plans
-plans .. what are you planning now ?

320
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:09,519
well dad, he promised to stay away
from these beautiful seneoritas...

321
00:51:10,094 --> 00:51:13,221
...and we got to plan our honeymoon.

322
00:51:18,221 --> 00:51:20,097
so long judge.
