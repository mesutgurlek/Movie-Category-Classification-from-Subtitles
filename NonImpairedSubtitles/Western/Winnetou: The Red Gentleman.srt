1
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:37,167
Winnetou, the noble Apache Chief,
rides relentlessly on his sworn mission...

2
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:42,208
to keep peace between his people
and the white settlers.

3
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:46,042
The advance of the white man into the
Indian hunting grounds created tension

4
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:50,875
on both sides. Winnetou rides to persuade
the chiefs of the North-Western tribes,

5
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:56,667
to prevent occasional uprisings against
the white man from developing into a war.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,167
A war that could mean
the destruction of all the Indian nation.

7
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,958
Mini ta schiha nintropan.

8
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:20,250
Ana hokesche muni.

9
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,958
Neha teka nintropan.

10
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:37,042
Kekaha tschekak ometan.
Unami sche loka.

11
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:39,875
Sehina mota.

12
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,292
Teleschoma tahini?

13
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:48,167
The Apache makes poor speech
with the Assiniboins.

14
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,500
Have you ever learned how to speak the
English language, heard in these parts?

15
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:58,792
We are fighting with the pale settlers.
Some of us know their language, though.

16
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:02,917
Tell me what you're called.
- Ribanna.

17
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,875
I am Winnetou.
- Winnetou?

18
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,333
Ribanna is hurt. She will ride my horse.
- Ribanna does not feel pain.

19
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:20,583
The Assiniboins are clearly courageous
if their warriors are like their women.

20
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,500
Ribanna can walk! Put me down!
- No.

21
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,958
Heta kahii!

22
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,500
These are my tribe's men.
Ascha kahe!

23
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:40,292
Hetet scha akulenkha Ribanna.
- Winnetou schoma mota.

24
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,375
Kale mina thin Ribanna.
- Ahe!

25
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,833
Ahi akita Apacheschana Assiniboins?

26
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:58,083
The Apache cannot speak our tongue.
But we share the speech of the white man.

27
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:02,458
Then I command him to say why an Apache is
in the hunting grounds of the Assiniboins.

28
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,667
To speak peace with your Chief,
Tah-Sha-Tunga.

29
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,083
Kitepa. Kitepa!

30
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,333
Enk aton!

31
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:08,958
Enem scha petra.
- Kih lo ka tahe, Ribanna?

32
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,375
The noble Apache Chief
saved my life today.

33
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:15,667
I was attacked by a bear
who wounded me.

34
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,833
Tah-Sha-Tunga's thanks.
You look to my daughter's safety.

35
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:26,875
If Winnetou should ever ask me
for anything, it is his.

36
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:35,167
Don't let them burn at the stake.
Let those men go. -I kamo nek sin!

37
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,583
Why should these men be your friends?
- They are not.

38
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:47,458
I beg this only to aid the cause of peace.
- Winnetou, will you follow?

39
00:08:00,042 --> 00:08:04,208
Did you hear that? Winnetou might help us.
There may be a chance.

40
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:11,167
White settlers invade my hunting grounds.
I can't tolerate their ruthless invasions.

41
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,667
I and my tribe have sworn
to burn at the stake every white man...

42
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:20,417
who falls into our hands.
Winnetou talks of peace.

43
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,667
In the name of our people I ask:
Is it we who have broken it?

44
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:30,583
I can consider only one thing:
all those who will die.

45
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:34,833
Our death is far less shaming
than to allow this to happen.

46
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:39,292
We can fight. But who looks after
your families if your warriors die?

47
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,958
What happens if we don't win?

48
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:49,292
No. To be alive, not merely to die,

49
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:54,542
and to stay at peace,
that is what Manitou decrees.

50
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:59,083
Winnetou's words scorch me as fire does.
Give us your idea.

51
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,958
I come to see you up here
because I feel the tribes here

52
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:09,333
in the Northern area
should work together with us in the South.

53
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:13,958
Winnetou will meet with Old Shatterhand,
a white man. Pay him respect.

54
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,625
He and Winnetou and Tah-Sha-Tunga
will ride to Fort Niobara.

55
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,833
The head of each tribe will join us there
in talks with the white man,

56
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:29,542
and see what can be done
about ending our hostilities.

57
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:39,500
Winnetou has not satisfied all the doubts
that lie in Tah-Sha-Tunga's breast.

58
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,875
Ribanna owes her life to your courage.
- When peace is in question,

59
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:48,583
one woman's life must not matter.
My father will freely decide:

60
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:51,000
war or peace.

61
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,625
It takes them so long. What's going on?
- Nothing for us to do. They're coming!

62
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:20,792
Do you realise just what awaits you?
- Yes.

63
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,583
Who are you?
- Lieutenant Merril, from Fort Niobara.

64
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:33,833
Isn't that the name of the man
who represents your government here?

65
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:38,083
That is a fact.
Colonel Frederik Merril, my father.

66
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:42,875
You are free! Please deliver a message
to your father: At the next full moon,

67
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,375
all our chiefs will meet at Fort Niobara
to plan how we may preserve our peace.

68
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,375
Thanks.

69
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:20,292
Now, Winnetou must grant a request
Tah-Sha-Tunga makes him.

70
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:24,500
That he stay here as our guest.
And when that day arrives,

71
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,708
we shall ride to Fort Niobara together.

72
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,958
Bob! Ronny!
- Yes?

73
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,708
What's that up there?
- I don't know.

74
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:10,125
It's unusual, because I know we're in
the vicinity of a tribe named the Poncas.

75
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,292
Shimu nahii?

76
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:22,083
We come in peace! We're friends!
- Tell us what you want with the Poncas!

77
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:26,292
Where's Blue Water Lake?
We lost our way.

78
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:30,542
Do not come any closer!
- You could put us on the right trail.

79
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:35,625
Don't come any closer!
- But if you put us on the right trail,

80
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:39,458
you'll be a barrel full of whisky richer.

81
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:10,000
You mad men!
You'll pay for this! Take my word!

82
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:14,333
Are you crazy?
Slaughtering Indians for no reason at all!

83
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:18,583
The only good ones are dead ones.
- I've dealt with cut-throats before,

84
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:22,208
who go around murdering people.
- Get moving. Get going!

85
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:30,333
We'll see you on the gallows.
- You give my regards to the Colonel.

86
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:33,458
If you get there.
- Okay.

87
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:36,875
Bill! Joe! Matt! Avery!

88
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:11,958
If grass don't grow and the goose
don't cry, why it ain't July!

89
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:16,208
If I blast a rat and he don't die,
it's a filthy lie!

90
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:21,667
I'll be alright.
- The cavalry unarmed in this region?

91
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,917
Since we were captured by Indians.
- Poncas?

92
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,167
No, Assiniboins.
The Chief of the Apaches... - Winnetou?

93
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:35,750
You'll be alright. Go and bandage it.
Yes. If it hadn't been for Winnetou,

94
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:40,167
we would have lost a lot more
than just our guns. - You're right.

95
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:45,083
Do you know who attacked you?
- I've no idea. They were part of

96
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:49,792
a gang of men that destroyed
a Ponca settlement. - Why?

97
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:54,500
I don't know. I shall deliver a message
with a peace proposal to Colonel Merril.

98
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:59,375
With those criminals, we might as well forget about peace.

99
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:04,083
There wasn't much the3 of us could do against that gang. - Leave it to me.

100
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:08,375
You're unarmed. My friend's a good shot. He'll get you to the Fort.

101
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:12,625
We're off to the Fort. I'm ready to go it. Fastest gun here

102
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,958
and raring to show it! Right here's the best and the only prairie poet.

103
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:22,125
I'm very glad to meet you. Would you mind, Sir, telling me your name?

104
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,792
They call me Old Shatterhand.

105
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:38,708
There! Ribanna is on the target! Why isn't Winnetou pleased?

106
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:44,042
Winnetou prefers that Ribanna not play with dangerous weapons.

107
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,875
Ribanna has shot arrows since she was a child.

108
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:52,792
She tries to take the place of the son, her father never had.

109
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,125
Ribanna!

110
00:18:57,417 --> 00:19:02,208
Winnetou asks for pardon. - Ribanna must see her father now.

111
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:04,875
Won't she stay?

112
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:10,542
Why didn't Ribanna mention to me she was the only child of the Chief?

113
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:14,875
Assiniboins say, if a girl talks too much, she will always live alone.

114
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,042
No man shall want her.

115
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:23,792
You shall not live alone, I know.

116
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,042
Ischoma. - Schoma anahii.

117
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:44,375
When we are threatened with danger, this cave is our refuge.

118
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:49,167
It is known only by Assiniboins. Winnetou is the only stranger

119
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,833
who knows it. - Is Winnetou a stranger?

120
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:57,083
Ribanna will answer Winnetou's question, if he waits right here.

121
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:13,208
Ribanna was speaking with her mouth, but not with her heart!

122
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:16,625
Winnetou is not a stranger.

123
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:24,000
And what would Ribanna say if she did speak with her heart?

124
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:28,542
What does Winnetou's heart say?
- Ribanna.

125
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:35,583
Winnetou.

126
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,083
Hands up!

127
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,958
Fine thing. Look at that hat, now.

128
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:02,833
Castlepool! - Old Shatterhand!

129
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:07,125
Well, what are you doing out here? - School's out, so here I am.

130
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:11,375
Collecting butterflies again this summer? - Oh, last year's hobby!

131
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:16,208
With the Papilio Polymnestor Parinda I completed my collection.

132
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:20,375
Something new has captured my interest. - What are you collecting this time?

133
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:24,250
Adventure, Sir. To a professor, adventure is glamour.

134
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:28,583
You sure did pick something different. I wish you lots of luck.

135
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:33,125
I am prepared to join forces with you. Adventure follows you. May I come?

136
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:38,500
It's ok. I'm after 2 dangerous criminals. They went off in that direction.

137
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:42,875
No, that's not where they rode off. They obliterated their tracks

138
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:46,583
to throw you off the trail. I myself watched them.

139
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,083
Come, Beauty! Come, come!

140
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:54,958
We'll seek that pair of criminals. - Alright. I'll take you with me.

141
00:22:56,125 --> 00:23:00,500
But I warn you. The 2 men I'm looking for belong to a dangerous gang of criminals.

142
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:03,708
That's sensational! Let's hop to and begin!

143
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:35,042
Boss! Boss, listen. We... -1 know. Lucas told me about it.

144
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:39,792
Did you get those soldiers? - No. We was ambushed.

145
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:44,000
What? You let them get away free? Do you realise the implications?

146
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:48,292
Must have been 20 or 30 gunmen. We're lucky to be here.

147
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:52,667
Take 10 men to Decama. There are soldiers around there.

148
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:57,167
Find out what's happening at Fort Niobara. I want every information you can get.

149
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:01,500
I want you to find out about everything! Anyone follow you? - No.

150
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:06,000
No one at all. We laid a false trail.
- We'll see.

151
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:27,417
I wonder what's up.

152
00:24:50,292 --> 00:24:54,750
Well? What are you standing around for?
Go on! Get to work!

153
00:24:54,833 --> 00:25:00,167
Do you want us to all go up in flames? How many times have I told you: no smoking?

154
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:12,333
Hey! What do you two want here, huh? Where are you from?

155
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:16,875
From the East. - Heading West, huh?

156
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:20,375
Obviously. - Don't use them words to me!

157
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:22,542
Take it easy, Carter.

158
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,542
Seems we've got ourselves a couple of visitors.

159
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:31,833
Are you the boss around here? - Yes, I am. And I don't like

160
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:36,583
strangers on my oil fields. What do you want? - Oil, please.

161
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:40,958
You want oil! Perhaps you're not aware of the fact that all the oil here

162
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:45,208
belongs to me. - Congratulations, Sir. It's for my lamp.

163
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:48,417
It makes reading a pleasure. - Is he trying to be funny?

164
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,208
No. We've come a long way. We'd like to buy supplies from your store.

165
00:25:53,292 --> 00:25:58,083
Well, you can't buy anything. I'll make you a trade, though.

166
00:25:58,167 --> 00:26:01,292
I like that horse. - So do I.

167
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:06,500
Here's my offer: You give me your horse,

168
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:10,208
and in exchange you'll get merchandise from my store worth 100 dollars.

169
00:26:10,292 --> 00:26:14,917
No, thank you, Mr Forrester, because... - Ok, 200 dollars. But that includes

170
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,167
the saddle and the 2 rifles. -1 won't part with my horse.

171
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:25,958
300 dollars for your two horses. Saddle, harness and weapons.

172
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:29,667
Now, look, Mister. You go too far. - Take it, or leave it.

173
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:39,042
You'd better take it. Bud Forrester always gets what he wants.

174
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:45,917
That's unfair! 100 of you against 2 of us. - Be quiet, Castlepool.

175
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:49,917
Go ahead.

176
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:53,083
Take him.

177
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,750
Stand back! And don't shoot!

178
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,458
I suni, Hatatitla. I suni.

179
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:13,958
Did you hear that? Hatatitla! That's Old Shatterhand's horse.

180
00:27:14,042 --> 00:27:17,167
So sorry. My horse doesn't like you.

181
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:22,458
Take the weapons to the barracks. See that the horses are locked up.

182
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:24,625
Then give me the key.

183
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:30,500
Come on! - Something smells around here.

184
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:36,792
I don't notice it. -1 didn't notice it before you came.

185
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:39,750
Get that smile off your face!

186
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:42,333
Stop that!

187
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:47,417
Stop it, you hear? - We'd better get rid of them.

188
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,625
No. We have to find a reason first. After all, they're white men, not Indians.

189
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:56,375
But that's easy. They won't get out of here. We'll put them to work tomorrow.

190
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,792
Old Shatterhand.

191
00:28:01,792 --> 00:28:05,958
Go in to the store. I must talk to you right away.

192
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:33,250
We were hired in Decama. Forrester supplies the oil there.

193
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:38,042
He promises commission and good lodgings, and broke his word. - He is a cad.

194
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:42,292
Folk say he has the oil concession for the whole valley.

195
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:46,542
Forrester has a claim on Indian territory? - Yeah.

196
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:52,042
The Poncas were supposed to go to Dakota. But not one of them has moved out of here.

197
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:56,292
And Forrester and his gang raise the Ponca village to the ground.

198
00:28:56,958 --> 00:29:01,750
Now I understand everything. - Forrester's a murderer.

199
00:29:02,292 --> 00:29:06,458
How many are you? - Over 60. And we're anxious to fight.

200
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:11,208
Forrester took our guns. They're locked out there with 2 day and 2 night guards.

201
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:16,000
Can you trust the driver of the oil wagon?
- This is him.

202
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:21,208
Good. We'll try to get the weapons as soon as it gets dark. With any luck,

203
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:25,792
we'll strike tonight. - Tonight? Something special is indicated.

204
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:28,875
I'll take these 2. It's a charge!

205
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:41,250
We made it, lads. As you can see, back at the fort, one, two, three!

206
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:46,042
The sun is sinking, out of sight. I'll do the same, and bid you goodnight!

207
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,417
It's Merril, Bob and Ronny.

208
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:58,958
Hey, Bruce! - Sure is good to see you three.

209
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:03,333
We were certain the Indians got you. - They almost did. It was very close.

210
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:06,542
Your father was worried about you.
Let's go!

211
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:26,500
Is the Colonel in his office? - Yes, Sir.

212
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:35,583
Lieutenant Merril, reporting in with his patrol. All present and accounted for.

213
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:40,083
Good, Lieutenant Merril. I'll expect a report in the morning. Good to see you!

214
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:44,125
Dad!

215
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:49,625
Thank the Lord you're back. We were all so worried.

216
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:52,333
Susan! - You're back!

217
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,292
Robert!

218
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:58,792
You're really here! - Like the bad penny, Susan.

219
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:03,542
You're brother's come back to you. Now, will you please dry your tears?

220
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:07,917
The Assiniboins tied us to stakes. They were preparing to burn us alive.

221
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,208
Thank heaven for Winnetou. - The Chief of the Apaches?

222
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:16,917
He saved us. I promised to bring along this message.

223
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,250
Winnetou convinced all the tribal elders to meet with you about a peace treaty.

224
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:25,500
So the reprisal I ordered did some good.
- You're mistaken.

225
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:29,417
You don't understand how much bitterness that caused among the Indians.

226
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:34,042
If you treated them just as you should, they'd do whatever you say.

227
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:39,000
You still take the part of the Indians. They resist the march of progress for...

228
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:43,542
You always put the blame on the Indians. Yet, I owe my life to an Indian.

229
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:48,333
But only a few hours later, I have to watch white men destroy an Indian village.

230
00:31:48,417 --> 00:31:52,500
Who did it? -1 don't know. There is someone who does.

231
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:18,542
My gun. - Right!

232
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:29,292
Give a hand.

233
00:33:29,917 --> 00:33:34,083
We've got them all. Get plenty of ammunition.

234
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:41,333
I hope nobody saw us. I have a feeling it went too smoothly.

235
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:45,792
These guns will have to be distributed among us. But no one must see us. Clark!

236
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:52,333
When the weapons are handed out, you will go and ring the alarm. - Right.

237
00:33:52,417 --> 00:33:54,792
And, then what? - You take...

238
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:57,958
Alright! Hands up! - Weren't you taught to knock

239
00:33:58,042 --> 00:34:01,167
before you enter a room? - You, too!

240
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,250
Higher!

241
00:34:06,542 --> 00:34:09,833
Old Shatterhand. The great big hero.

242
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:17,292
The protector of the Indians. - And you slaughtered the Poncas!

243
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:21,583
I hid oil here, and they interfered with my operation.

244
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:25,792
You're a swindler, Forrester. A swindler and a murderer!

245
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:31,875
I make my own laws. One of them is that, whoever preaches rebellion to my men,

246
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:37,333
will be hanged. And this man did worse. Right?

247
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:18,500
Come on! Get up!

248
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:23,708
On your horses!

249
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,417
In to the store! Get your rifles, you hear?

250
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:39,000
Stop him!

251
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:17,458
Alright! Get that dynamite out! - Here goes!

252
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:27,667
Get back! It's coming towards us!

253
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:15,208
Now they've got what they deserve!

254
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,708
Everything's going to the devil. - It was the only way. I had no choice.

255
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:37,417
We'll build New Venango again.

256
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:07,708
Castlepool!

257
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:30,250
Winnetou.

258
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:09,292
Where has my brother gone? - The smoke still covers the valley.

259
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:13,542
I observed more than 50 men. - What are they doing?

260
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:16,708
They extinguished the fire.

261
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:20,750
One of them wore a black leather jacket. - That was Forrester.

262
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:25,000
We mustn't lose him. I'll stay here, and you go and get some help.

263
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:29,333
No. Peace must come first. After that, we'll find Forrester and punish him.

264
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:33,583
I would like first that you ride to Fort Niobara. - When?

265
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:38,875
We leave at once. We go to the Assiniboins.
I promised the chief

266
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:42,125
we would ride together with him. - What do we do about Castlepool?

267
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:46,583
He bids you goodbye. A thousand thanks for the collector's item.

268
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:50,833
I had the best time. - Where are you aiming to head for now?

269
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,167
For the next adventure, I should see Mr Forrester, and solve that problem.

270
00:39:55,375 --> 00:40:01,042
I appreciate your wanting to. But it might be your last adventure.

271
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:05,417
Thanks! I think it will be Laramie, then. There's a lot of bad doings there!

272
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,708
If you'd listen to me, the one place you'd stay away from is New Venango.

273
00:40:09,792 --> 00:40:14,833
Old Castlepool has got the hang of this part of the world. He knows the answers!

274
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:54,750
Yeah!

275
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:17,708
Welcome to New Venango! - What are you doing, playing with toys?

276
00:41:17,792 --> 00:41:22,250
If you don't stop, I'll call the Sheriff! And I mean it! - Quiet!

277
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:26,500
What's all the noise about? Who's that?
Bring him here!

278
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:36,083
What were you looking for up there? - Raspberries, Sir. Wild raspberries.

279
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:40,875
Seems to me, I remember you. Of course! You came here with Old Shatterhand,

280
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:45,875
and began all that excitement. The fire didn't kill you? - No, sorry.

281
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:50,125
Thank goodness, that is. - Tell me, where's your friend now?

282
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,792
I don't know, Sir. - You really don't know?

283
00:41:52,875 --> 00:41:55,958
Definitely not! - Too bad. You'll have to stay here

284
00:41:56,042 --> 00:42:00,125
until you can remember. Tie him to that pole,

285
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:03,333
so the sun can warm his brain a little.
Come on!

286
00:42:13,292 --> 00:42:15,375
That's her, there.

287
00:42:20,792 --> 00:42:23,792
Ashameha mehe! Kitepa!

288
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,667
This is Ribanna.

289
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:03,833
In a few days, I'm going to marry her.

290
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:08,208
I wanted Old Shatterhand to know. You're our friend, part of the family.

291
00:43:18,292 --> 00:43:21,417
Colonel? I beg to state my opinion, Sir.

292
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:25,833
It's too soon to be disturbed too much. - What do you mean? It's written here:

293
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:31,208
"The President is gravely concerned over the possibility of any new situation causing

294
00:43:31,292 --> 00:43:36,083
an Indian war. We must prevent war, no matter what the cost."

295
00:43:36,292 --> 00:43:41,125
Prevent! But how? Nobody can tell us how to do that.

296
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:45,375
There's no one who can make the Indians forget the Ponca village incident.

297
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:51,583
Perhaps, my dear Sir, you can advise us.

298
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:56,792
I say the problem is: How can we convince the people

299
00:43:56,875 --> 00:44:01,042
we lied to for so long, that this time we mean it?

300
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:04,250
I must say, you're brutally frank. - But, it's true.

301
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:08,958
We moved into the Indian's territory.
It wasn't ours.

302
00:44:09,042 --> 00:44:13,250
But that's ancient history. Those stories are over.

303
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:17,542
They don't agree with the facts. - But they still hold true, Sir.

304
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:23,000
The Indians began to offend themselves when you drove them out of their land.

305
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:26,292
Thanks very much for your advice.

306
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:30,542
But if you'd seen the mutilated victims of the Cheyennes,

307
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:34,042
you wouldn't feel so sorry for those poor redskins.

308
00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:40,208
I was under the impression that we were trying to find a peaceful solution.

309
00:44:40,292 --> 00:44:44,875
Of course. As a soldier, I carry out the orders issued to me.

310
00:44:44,958 --> 00:44:47,042
They're coming!

311
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:25,583
For a long time only our weapons spoke. But now, we heed the call of peace.

312
00:46:26,167 --> 00:46:30,333
We have sent messengers to the East, to report out desire for friendship.

313
00:46:30,417 --> 00:46:34,542
Our great leader in Washington speaks to you through my mouth.

314
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:38,292
We received Winnetou's message and we felt great joy

315
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:42,542
that so many powerful and famous chiefs have gathered here. And I know,

316
00:46:42,625 --> 00:46:47,125
today is a great chance for all Americans to secure the lasting peace we need.

317
00:46:48,417 --> 00:46:51,792
In this momentous, historic hour, I salute you all.

318
00:46:52,917 --> 00:46:57,458
I salute the brave warriors of the Assiniboins, of the Mandan,

319
00:46:58,167 --> 00:47:00,208
Pawnee and Chippewa,

320
00:47:00,292 --> 00:47:03,208
the Osages, Sioux and Navajos.

321
00:47:04,417 --> 00:47:07,000
Of the Schoschones, Crow and Dakota.

322
00:47:08,917 --> 00:47:13,167
That is the greeting I am delegated to bring from the President in Washington.

323
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:14,833
Pashi Ponca!

324
00:47:18,792 --> 00:47:23,042
There's the last one. That man's a Ponca. - Now, things will be different.

325
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:36,958
We salute the government in Washington, and those of you here.

326
00:47:37,042 --> 00:47:41,708
We must bury our differences. Our country is big enough for all of us,

327
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:46,083
if we respect each other and live together in peace.

328
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:50,417
There have been wrongs on both sides. - When there is property damage,

329
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,625
we do make it up. - How do white men value...

330
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:57,875
lives of 2 times 100 warriors, women and children of my village?

331
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:01,083
They were brutally slain by pale faces.

332
00:48:01,917 --> 00:48:07,250
No more than I put on our white settlers, whom the Cheyennes destroyed at Newcomb.

333
00:48:08,542 --> 00:48:09,583
War!

334
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:11,917
Kill!

335
00:48:13,417 --> 00:48:14,542
Kill!

336
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:16,458
Death! -War!

337
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:25,583
Outrages committed by criminals are not our responsibility!

338
00:48:25,917 --> 00:48:27,250
Dako!

339
00:48:27,333 --> 00:48:31,500
Where's the man to guarantee us that it will not happen again?

340
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:37,000
I, Old Shatterhand! Here's my word. Once the peace treaty has been signed,

341
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:40,667
Winnetou and I will track down these men,

342
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:44,042
and see they're brought to justice. -1 believe you.

343
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:48,750
Still you cannot do it single-handed. The soldiers must keep the law.

344
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:56,292
Peace will always be broken, because white men despise us.

345
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:58,542
Death.

346
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:00,833
Yes, kill! -War!

347
00:49:00,917 --> 00:49:02,167
War!

348
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:05,375
Then still the weapons do the talking!
- No.

349
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:11,833
Aren't you tired of war and death? - We do not fear death.

350
00:49:11,917 --> 00:49:15,167
No more peace! We must war!
- Kill!

351
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:16,292
Kill!

352
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:22,250
You cannot make a decision in rage. We come asking for peace.

353
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:27,708
You know the Indian. He's known to keep his oath.

354
00:49:28,292 --> 00:49:31,500
Can that be said of the white men?

355
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:35,750
Who of you will guarantee peace? -1! I'll guarantee it.

356
00:49:37,042 --> 00:49:41,208
Because I believe that the white man and the Indians must live together in peace.

357
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:45,500
You must realise, there are men like us, sympathetic to your people.

358
00:49:45,833 --> 00:49:50,000
But as in all races, there are honourable men and men who do evil.

359
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:54,208
In other words: All men are equal.

360
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:57,625
Lieutenant Merril! I command you, be silent!

361
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:05,167
No, Father! You're wrong in the things you say of us. That we hate you.

362
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:09,458
That we are not your friends. I shall soon prove that we are friends.

363
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:15,125
Here's how it can happen. Allow a wedding that will unite all our people.

364
00:50:15,625 --> 00:50:19,958
Join Ribanna, daughter of the Chief of the Assiniboins, and me!

365
00:50:23,792 --> 00:50:26,917
It's up to you. I beg to marry your daughter!

366
00:50:43,417 --> 00:50:49,042
You must be aware that, by doing this, you'll be through in the army.

367
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:53,292
If I can manage to bring us peace here, that's all that matters.

368
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:58,542
When Ribanna shall move into house of white man, peace shall be sealed.

369
00:51:32,042 --> 00:51:33,083
Winnetou!

370
00:51:38,667 --> 00:51:42,833
What is it? -1 didn't think my heart could break.

371
00:51:43,042 --> 00:51:48,417
The Gods are cruel to us. The unfairest thing is, that I must bring you this news.

372
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:03,292
Shoma kateh!

373
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:08,417
Was ha manoka! Nuhu shunishie!

374
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,583
I can't!

375
00:52:10,792 --> 00:52:14,958
Let's run away. To me, you're all that matters. I'll never marry that man!

376
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:19,750
No, Ribanna. - I'll get my horse!

377
00:52:20,833 --> 00:52:23,833
Nu scha mahini Ribanna waha!

378
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:28,500
Have the noble Apache and Ribanna yet spoken? - We did.

379
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:30,500
She understands.

380
00:52:31,417 --> 00:52:36,375
She knows that our fate and the path our people choose,

381
00:52:36,458 --> 00:52:40,792
depend on this marriage. The choices between war and peace,

382
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:44,500
life and destruction. You must obey.

383
00:52:52,875 --> 00:52:56,250
Ribanna and Winnetou respect peace.
Somehow,

384
00:52:56,333 --> 00:53:00,500
I'm not sure if such an uncertain truce can be worth what we're doing.

385
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:10,292
Winnetou must try to forget. You'll help me.

386
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:14,542
We've got an awful lot to do. - We'll start on Forrester!

387
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:20,167
What did you say? Peace! - Everybody's talking about it.

388
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:28,750
Colonel Merril negotiated with the chiefs. The worst news is that his son,

389
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:33,000
Lieutenant Merril, is going to marry a chief's daughter.

390
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:40,917
Jenson! Carter! I want you over here right away! And all the other men!

391
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,125
Right away, Boss. - This way! Come on!

392
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:51,083
They're going to have a peace treaty with the redskins at Fort Niobara.

393
00:53:51,167 --> 00:53:55,333
You know what that means? - We sure do, Boss!

394
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,792
By the time we wait for those dirty Indians to leave their land,

395
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:05,417
the Blue Coats will be after us. We must do something about it!

396
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:10,958
We'll spoil the plans of the peacemakers. I know exactly how to get the land.

397
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,958
I shall read from Ephesians:

398
00:54:17,125 --> 00:54:21,292
You have taken my heart with your eyes, give me a place in your heart.

399
00:54:21,417 --> 00:54:26,667
He that loves his wife, loves himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh.

400
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:29,875
But nourishes and cherishes it, even as the law of the church.

401
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:33,875
For we are members of his body, of his flesh and of his bones. Amen.

402
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:37,833
So come unto the Lord. And be prepared.

403
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:52,333
Robert Merril, will you take this woman, Ribanna, as your wedded wife?

404
00:54:52,417 --> 00:54:55,500
Yes, I will. - And you, Ribanna?

405
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:59,750
Will you take this man, Robert Merril, for your wedded husband?

406
00:54:59,833 --> 00:55:02,042
Yes, I will.

407
00:55:02,125 --> 00:55:06,292
By virtue of the authority vested in me, I pronounce you man and wife.

408
00:55:07,125 --> 00:55:12,833
Your union will be a shining example, and will help bring us a life of peace.

409
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:44,042
The man tied to the pole is Castlepool. He said he was going to Laramie.

410
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:48,417
The fool! He didn't listen. - If my brother will watch out for me,

411
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:52,125
Winnetou will release him. - There is only one guard,

412
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:56,417
and very few horses. - Forrester's not here, I'm certain.

413
00:55:56,625 --> 00:56:00,792
What's he up to now? - Castlepool will know where he went.

414
00:56:12,667 --> 00:56:14,208
It fits!

415
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:59,333
Hey! If you want my hat, the price has gone up. It's 6 dollars!

416
00:56:59,417 --> 00:57:03,958
But you ain't going nowhere. - It would fit you fine if it were square,

417
00:57:04,042 --> 00:57:07,667
like your fat head. - I'll shut your trap, quick!

418
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:41,583
Oh, Suzanna, don't you cry for me!

419
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:51,083
Well, how's our fine gentleman? Isn't it time you went to sleep?

420
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:54,208
Sweet dreams, your Highness. - Goodnight, my Lord.

421
00:58:12,667 --> 00:58:14,208
6 dollars!

422
00:58:25,958 --> 00:58:29,708
Who's that? Hey! What's going on? - Something's going on outside!

423
00:58:32,042 --> 00:58:34,125
There they are!

424
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:53,333
Forrester went to Grey Stone Canyon with his men to hold up a wagon train,

425
00:58:53,417 --> 00:58:58,083
and then blame the Indians. - We must get to the wagons immediately.

426
00:58:58,375 --> 00:59:02,542
It's a full days ride to Grey Stone Canyon, but we have to warn them. Come on!

427
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:38,917
Halt! - Halt!

428
00:59:44,375 --> 00:59:47,500
It's alright, folks! - They aren't Indians!

429
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:05,792
Follow me!

430
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:56,667
You'll never get out of here alive! So why don't you give up?

431
01:01:56,750 --> 01:02:00,917
We'll come out! And you'll pay for murdering those innocent people.

432
01:02:01,542 --> 01:02:05,708
You're wrong. One of my men is at Fort Niobara right now.

433
01:02:05,792 --> 01:02:09,958
He's reporting as the only "survivor" of an Indian attack on a wagon train.

434
01:02:11,042 --> 01:02:14,958
There'll be 3 more victims!
You!

435
01:02:15,708 --> 01:02:19,875
He's the lone survivor of a wagon train. All the others were killed.

436
01:02:20,958 --> 01:02:24,083
They were Assiniboins. Assiniboins!

437
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:32,875
What do you mean, Assiniboins?

438
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:37,583
They murdered Mama. They showed no mercy at all.

439
01:02:38,917 --> 01:02:42,958
My mother, my children, everybody!

440
01:02:45,667 --> 01:02:50,667
You've got to have courage, or try to. The thing you've been through is terrible.

441
01:02:50,792 --> 01:02:54,958
Please go and make him comfortable. What is your name?

442
01:02:55,042 --> 01:02:57,958
Lucas, Sir. David Lucas.

443
01:02:58,042 --> 01:03:02,292
I want you to see that this man is offered every consideration.

444
01:03:02,375 --> 01:03:06,667
We will serve to help him forget. Put him over in my orderly's tent.

445
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:09,833
See that he gets some rest. - Yes, Sir.

446
01:03:09,917 --> 01:03:11,375
Alright, now.

447
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:14,042
Captain Bruce! - Yes, Sir?

448
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:19,042
Ride to Grey Stone Canyon with 10 men. Report to me, immediately upon return.

449
01:03:19,125 --> 01:03:23,333
I want to know if what this man tells about is fact.

450
01:03:23,417 --> 01:03:27,583
And, shoot to kill every last Assiniboin you can locate and destroy.

451
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:33,500
Sir, we number only 24 soldiers.

452
01:03:33,792 --> 01:03:37,958
It is better to wait until Lt. Jackson returns from the field with his men.

453
01:03:38,125 --> 01:03:40,667
Very well. Wait until tonight.

454
01:03:42,208 --> 01:03:46,708
Not to be trusted a minute, those Indians. And I've always known it.

455
01:03:46,792 --> 01:03:51,250
They talk of peace, law and justice! But as soon as our backs are turned,

456
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:55,917
they start to betray us! Now it's my turn! I order my soldiers not to show any mercy.

457
01:03:56,750 --> 01:04:00,875
I am a soldier. And I must follow the orders I'm given.

458
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:05,250
I shouldn't reveal this to you. But, you're my friend, and I had to.

459
01:04:05,333 --> 01:04:09,625
I thought you could to do something. - Where is this so-called "survivor"?

460
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:14,167
In the orderly's tent. Be careful. - Don't worry. And, thanks, Tom.

461
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:17,375
You've been a mighty good friend.
- Good luck.

462
01:04:18,417 --> 01:04:21,500
Ribanna! -1 must clear the Assiniboins.

463
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:25,708
They didn't do it! - Where are you going?
To see my father.

464
01:04:25,792 --> 01:04:30,500
We go together. I know it wasn't your father who broke the peace.

465
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:34,583
We must get at the truth together! - What can we do?

466
01:04:34,667 --> 01:04:39,500
Double the guards! If there's anything suspicious, sound the alarm!

467
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:43,833
Pack everything up, including ammunition and rifles.

468
01:04:43,917 --> 01:04:48,083
Put all of it on the horses. Oh, yes... Some strong rope and a tent.

469
01:04:48,167 --> 01:04:52,333
If anybody asks, let them believe that we're on an overnight hunting trip.

470
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,625
First that "survivor" has to be contacted.

471
01:05:15,292 --> 01:05:17,375
Here they come.

472
01:05:33,667 --> 01:05:40,125
They adopted that from the Middle Ages! - One shot alone, won't help. But...

473
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:05,917
Those cowards! - Don't you think we'd be better give up?

474
01:06:06,042 --> 01:06:10,250
We've lost 16 men. - They know we raided the wagon train.

475
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:14,583
We can't let them get away. - They're safe in that position.

476
01:06:14,667 --> 01:06:18,833
Say they hold out until the soldiers come? - Your warnings will drive me crazy.

477
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:22,750
I'm going to try some other plan.
Let's go!

478
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:28,458
Forrester knows what he's in for. He won't dare quit.

479
01:06:28,542 --> 01:06:31,875
We have to try to distract him, so we can get to the lake.

480
01:06:31,958 --> 01:06:36,208
That body has a lasso. I could make good use out of it.

481
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:40,875
They've got 3 colts and 3 rifles, too. - My friend reads my thoughts.

482
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:46,542
Go in there and rest.

483
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:16,042
Not a sound. You make one move, you're going to be dead.

484
01:07:16,125 --> 01:07:19,250
Turn over and put your hands behind you!
Go on!

485
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:27,750
Beats me where you get these ideas, Boss!

486
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:31,375
Go get the powder! - Some gadget!

487
01:07:31,458 --> 01:07:32,958
Take cover!

488
01:07:42,542 --> 01:07:44,083
Alright! Now!

489
01:07:48,583 --> 01:07:50,167
Take this.

490
01:07:53,458 --> 01:07:55,542
Here's the powder, here.

491
01:07:57,583 --> 01:07:58,625
Ready!

492
01:08:01,667 --> 01:08:02,708
There!

493
01:08:09,792 --> 01:08:11,125
Hit it!

494
01:08:29,417 --> 01:08:33,042
What is it? - Look at that! That's our men!

495
01:08:35,917 --> 01:08:40,250
Why are you standing around? What's wrong? - They've gone. They're not here!

496
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:43,458
Are you crazy? They were shooting at us from there.

497
01:08:46,625 --> 01:08:50,792
They took our dead men, and fastened ropes to the triggers of their rifles and colts.

498
01:08:51,792 --> 01:08:54,125
Let's see. - Hey, Red!

499
01:08:54,208 --> 01:08:58,375
There's more of that rope around the lake! - They fooled us for sure, damn it!

500
01:08:58,458 --> 01:09:03,458
While we were busy making that catapult, they got away and pulled these strings.

501
01:09:03,542 --> 01:09:05,667
Let's search the lake.

502
01:09:07,958 --> 01:09:09,000
Hurry!

503
01:09:15,042 --> 01:09:19,458
They're not here! The shore is there, so we couldn't have missed them!

504
01:09:19,542 --> 01:09:24,708
They couldn't go far. Take half the men. You start searching along the canyon.

505
01:09:24,792 --> 01:09:29,375
I'll search this direction! - Right! Come on, boys! Follow me!

506
01:09:45,542 --> 01:09:48,542
Schane makela nem sche ika.

507
01:09:49,792 --> 01:09:53,500
Kesche namoschi loka schi tuma. - Schuma mota!

508
01:09:53,583 --> 01:09:57,750
My warriors say, a quick death would be too easy.

509
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,792
But my son speaks against this. - You will be given a fair trial.

510
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:08,750
We'll use him as a hostage.

511
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:11,750
Like ste squaw mine kaschu.

512
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:14,958
Та schi ma ahtili noha. - Mohana!

513
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:19,958
When the tents have been packed,
we will go.

514
01:10:36,583 --> 01:10:40,958
Have courage. I know you would join me to hunt these murderers.

515
01:10:41,042 --> 01:10:45,792
Remember this: remain alive and together.
If not, there's war.

516
01:10:45,875 --> 01:10:50,500
Only peace can bring the Indian his freedom. Schetaha loka.

517
01:10:50,583 --> 01:10:52,667
Schetaha mahini.

518
01:11:17,458 --> 01:11:18,625
Halt!

519
01:11:23,625 --> 01:11:26,625
Hey! It's Old Shatterhand!

520
01:11:28,625 --> 01:11:32,792
We just came back from Grey Stone Canyon. - The place we were going to investigate

521
01:11:32,958 --> 01:11:38,083
the wagon train the Assiniboins got. - It was Forrester and his bandits.

522
01:11:38,167 --> 01:11:42,333
It was Forrester! -1 can put you on their tracks.

523
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:45,583
Winnetou won't let them out of his sight.

524
01:11:45,875 --> 01:11:48,875
We didn't know about Forrester.

525
01:11:57,208 --> 01:12:00,333
Any luck? - No, Boss. We rode for 3 hours...

526
01:12:00,458 --> 01:12:04,625
and looked everywhere. They disappeared!
- Those dirty dogs.

527
01:12:05,083 --> 01:12:06,625
What's next?

528
01:12:06,792 --> 01:12:11,083
We've got to get supplies and ammunition.
- And the wounded?

529
01:12:11,167 --> 01:12:15,333
They stay right here. They're useless. What are you standing around there for?

530
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:19,667
Go on! Get on your horses! - Our horses are tired. We've got to...

531
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:23,875
We're going to Vernango! The soldiers could be here any minute. If we're not...

532
01:12:23,958 --> 01:12:27,583
in Blackwood before dawn, we haven't got a chance!

533
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:54,917
Kehii taschu! - Kishi ma tera!

534
01:12:56,625 --> 01:13:01,583
Lorom shalera! Kose nikatuma Forrester! - Nomesha tschhi Venango makela Forrester!

535
01:13:04,167 --> 01:13:08,333
My scout reports that Forrester is not in Vernango. Where is he?

536
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:13,417
No answer? Then we shall go to the fox's lair and wait.

537
01:13:13,667 --> 01:13:18,125
And if he does not return by break of day, you shall die! Tse kischi pteh schoma!

538
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:21,333
Kahii ta Venango!

539
01:14:11,042 --> 01:14:15,208
Come out, holding your hands high. Or we'll set you on fire!

540
01:15:35,583 --> 01:15:38,708
That's enough! We're going! Come on!

541
01:15:38,792 --> 01:15:42,958
Hey! Get up, you! - Look over there! Someone's coming!

542
01:15:47,083 --> 01:15:50,208
Why, it's Lucas! - Lucas!

543
01:15:50,667 --> 01:15:55,542
It didn't work! The Assiniboins are laying in wait at Vernango.

544
01:16:03,542 --> 01:16:08,167
If we don't go to Vernango, and they search for you, they'll find our tracks.

545
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:12,417
Then, we'll have them both on our necks. - What about going to Mexico?

546
01:16:13,458 --> 01:16:17,625
We'd never get there. It's 14 days hard riding!

547
01:16:17,917 --> 01:16:22,083
And we've got a 4 hour lead at the most. - That's enough to get to the Assiniboins.

548
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:27,667
What's that? Why should we head up there?
- Two hostages.

549
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:33,708
One, Robert Merril. And Ribanna, daughter of the chief of the Assiniboins!

550
01:16:35,208 --> 01:16:39,333
Say that again. -1 was blindfolded.

551
01:16:39,417 --> 01:16:43,708
The sun was low and in the west. My right ear is sunburnt,

552
01:16:43,792 --> 01:16:48,917
so we were heading south, I'm sure. From the village,

553
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,375
I counted 820steps. Must have a hideout, I think. Let's look for a cave.

554
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:58,333
They're coming back! - Nomi Ta-Sha-Tunga!

555
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,167
They look like Forrester's men. I'm sure they haven't seen us yet.

556
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:25,375
Go on! Hurry! - Nomi Ta-Sha-Tunga!

557
01:17:33,125 --> 01:17:34,417
806...

558
01:17:36,083 --> 01:17:37,958
807...

559
01:17:39,667 --> 01:17:41,542
808...

560
01:17:42,458 --> 01:17:46,208
Look over there! We've found the cave!

561
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,375
They've discovered the cave! They may becoming in here to hide.

562
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:07,583
We'll have to go further. - Tehine шока tinungi! Kitepa!

563
01:18:28,625 --> 01:18:32,792
You're trapped, Merril! - Come on out! And the woman, too!

564
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:36,375
And come on out, or you're finished!

565
01:18:41,542 --> 01:18:45,792
Is there any other way out of here? - The cliff entrance, but it's slippery.

566
01:18:45,875 --> 01:18:48,583
Nobody could ever reach it. It's too smooth.

567
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:50,292
Come on!

568
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:25,000
Tell them to be quiet when the men pass. If they make a single sound...

569
01:19:25,333 --> 01:19:27,750
Leschana hoka nischuni!

570
01:19:32,875 --> 01:19:36,000
Hey, Boss, look! - They must be here. Come on!

571
01:20:08,167 --> 01:20:10,250
There they are! Shoot!

572
01:20:23,917 --> 01:20:24,958
Come on!

573
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:36,792
Robert!

574
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:38,667
Robert!

575
01:20:47,583 --> 01:20:49,792
It's the army.

576
01:20:58,250 --> 01:20:59,583
Take cover!

577
01:21:03,917 --> 01:21:08,083
Carter! See if you can find another exit. Come on! Keep going!

578
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:27,625
Forrester's men, I'm sure. -1 know what we're going to do about it.

579
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:30,000
Asihescha ti kumana!

580
01:21:40,875 --> 01:21:42,958
Give up, now, Forrester!

581
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:47,542
We've got the cave surrounded, and you're in trouble!

582
01:21:47,625 --> 01:21:52,542
We guarantee you a fair trial. We demand that you come out right now!

583
01:21:53,917 --> 01:21:56,000
Alright! We're coming!

584
01:21:57,917 --> 01:22:02,083
Merril and his wife! - Look! I'm the man who makes demands!

585
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:07,042
I demand freedom for myself and my men as far as the Mexican border!

586
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:11,250
You'll return the horses to us. Give us plenty of ammunition!

587
01:22:11,333 --> 01:22:15,625
I want a 2 week supply of provisions, placed on that rock over there.

588
01:22:15,708 --> 01:22:18,292
All of you stay out of range.

589
01:22:18,375 --> 01:22:22,542
If you meet my demands, we'll set the hostages free at the border.

590
01:22:22,625 --> 01:22:27,875
But if you don't, we'll shoot them! - We'll stall for time.

591
01:22:29,042 --> 01:22:31,625
It's the only thing we can do.

592
01:22:32,833 --> 01:22:38,167
Hear me. Everything's on your side. We have to go along with you.

593
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:43,125
But our pack-horses were left down below. We need an hour time to get them up here

594
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:47,667
and hand them over to you. - An hour, then. But not a minute longer!

595
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:51,875
And if any of your men start shooting, they'll be the ones to suffer!

596
01:22:51,958 --> 01:22:56,125
Guard the entrance with 10 men! - Right! Come on! Step to it!

597
01:22:57,167 --> 01:23:01,833
You listen to me, now! Nobody is going to be shooting, unless I order them.

598
01:23:05,708 --> 01:23:10,042
Take them further in and tie them up.
- Boss! Boss!

599
01:23:10,125 --> 01:23:14,958
Down this passage is a small opening. But you need a rope to get out.

600
01:23:15,042 --> 01:23:17,125
J want to see it.

601
01:23:19,292 --> 01:23:21,375
Hand me that rope!

602
01:23:31,833 --> 01:23:33,917
You two come with us!

603
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:39,708
Here!

604
01:23:40,208 --> 01:23:41,250
Up there!

605
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,375
It's at least 40feet. You're right. No chance without a rope.

606
01:23:47,458 --> 01:23:50,583
I wonder if you can get in from the outside.

607
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:55,667
You stay here. If you hear anything, sound the alarm. - Yeah, Boss.

608
01:24:02,792 --> 01:24:07,375
After we cross the border, what do we do with the hostages? - Kill them.

609
01:24:07,458 --> 01:24:11,667
Somebody will help us. Try to hold on. - Ribanna has great trust.

610
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:16,542
She knows Old Shatterhand. 3 times she heard the mountain dog call.

611
01:24:16,625 --> 01:24:18,625
Ribanna knows Winnetou is very near.

612
01:24:40,917 --> 01:24:44,042
I don't see nothing down there.

613
01:24:44,167 --> 01:24:46,250
Is it an hour yet?

614
01:24:47,542 --> 01:24:49,625
27 minutes to go.

615
01:25:21,708 --> 01:25:23,792
Boss! It's Tah-Sha-Tunga!

616
01:25:25,875 --> 01:25:26,917
Over there.

617
01:25:36,583 --> 01:25:39,917
From the very start, I wasn't satisfied with this.

618
01:25:41,375 --> 01:25:45,542
Now I'm satisfied, do you hear? - How much time now?

619
01:25:48,042 --> 01:25:49,083
None.

620
01:25:51,375 --> 01:25:53,958
Alright, over there! Time's up!

621
01:25:55,167 --> 01:26:00,458
The chief says they're having trouble getting up with the pack-horses.

622
01:26:00,542 --> 01:26:03,667
One's lame. Give us 10 more minutes!

623
01:26:04,083 --> 01:26:07,208
You can't make a fool of me!

624
01:26:07,375 --> 01:26:11,542
If the horses aren't up in 2 minutes, I'll have the woman's tongues cut out!

625
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:17,417
He's not human. He's the devil. - Tell your soldiers to get ready.

626
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:21,083
If worst comes to worst, we'll have to attack.

627
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,708
41... 42... 43...

628
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:22,458
44... 45... 46...

629
01:27:23,417 --> 01:27:26,125
47... 48... 49...

630
01:27:26,667 --> 01:27:29,375
50... 51... 52...

631
01:27:29,958 --> 01:27:32,667
53... 54... 55...

632
01:27:33,542 --> 01:27:36,250
56... 57... 58...

633
01:27:36,625 --> 01:27:39,292
59... . 60! Your time's up!

634
01:27:39,375 --> 01:27:44,583
I'll have them bring the prisoners here, so you can see what we do to them! Go.

635
01:27:50,667 --> 01:27:53,083
Ribanna! Ribanna!

636
01:27:56,125 --> 01:27:59,958
He's here at last! Ribanna was sure of it. - Whose voice is that?

637
01:28:00,042 --> 01:28:01,917
Winnetou!

638
01:28:02,125 --> 01:28:03,833
Aya!

639
01:28:33,458 --> 01:28:34,500
Chase them!

640
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:39,042
Into the cave!

641
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:07,542
Take cover!

642
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:26,875
Castlepool, hold your gun down!
- Up!

643
01:29:40,042 --> 01:29:43,167
Thank you. Let's find Forrester, now.
- We can't!

644
01:29:43,292 --> 01:29:46,417
Forrester must be left to the Assinaboions.

645
01:30:31,875 --> 01:30:34,208
Tihe kusan oloka? - Lo!

646
01:30:49,625 --> 01:30:50,667
There!

647
01:32:22,708 --> 01:32:27,958
I'm thankful to you. I spent a good summer out here.

648
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:31,167
And, now what do you plan to do?
- Oh...

649
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:36,458
I'll be teaching at my university. And then, I'll begin a new collection.
