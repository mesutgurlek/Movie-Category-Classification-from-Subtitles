1
00:01:49,623 --> 00:01:52,217
There ain't nothin' steady
about a woman, Stokes.

2
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:55,352
Their minds is as changeable
as the moon.

3
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:59,331
Yeah. And there's
always a man in it.

4
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,867
Man in the moon,Juke,
get it?

5
00:02:01,935 --> 00:02:05,268
No. My Pearl ain't like that.

6
00:02:05,338 --> 00:02:08,398
You and Pearl figure on
holy matrimony?

7
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:11,672
She don't like my whiskers. Then
why don't you whack them off?

8
00:02:11,745 --> 00:02:15,875
Oh, Pearl wants me to,
but I keep thinkin' about Samson.

9
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:18,645
You mean Samson,
the little tailor in Albuquerque?

10
00:02:18,718 --> 00:02:21,949
No, you heathen.
Samson was a king.

11
00:02:22,022 --> 00:02:26,516
Lived in Egypt or " Afrikee" or
someplace like that. Well, what about him?

12
00:02:26,593 --> 00:02:29,323
Well, he had a mane and whiskers
just like mine.

13
00:02:29,396 --> 00:02:31,387
Strongest fella you ever seen.

14
00:02:31,465 --> 00:02:35,026
Pushed buildings over
with his bare hands. Yes, sir.

15
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:37,661
He had a gal, too,
named Delilah.

16
00:02:37,737 --> 00:02:41,104
Didn't she like whiskers either?
No, sir.

17
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:46,737
Snuck in one night, clipped Samson
slicker than a frog's belly.

18
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:51,147
After that he was so durn weak,
couldn't even break a toothpick.

19
00:02:55,388 --> 00:02:57,856
You're an awfully sweet little girl,
Miss Myrtle,

20
00:02:57,924 --> 00:03:00,586
and it won't be long before
you meet your daddy in Albuquerque.

21
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,494
Oh, Mr. Cole, you're so funny.
Isn't he, Miss Wallace?

22
00:03:04,564 --> 00:03:06,794
Yes, honey, very amusing,

23
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:09,563
Amusing? He's funny.
Isn't he, Mr. Martin?

24
00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:14,039
Very funny. Yes, sir, he's a
regular circus. Certainly is.

25
00:03:14,107 --> 00:03:16,200
Thank you, ma'am, ladies.
I aim to please.

26
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:19,302
You know, Miss Myrtle, if I was
gonna see the man I love most,

27
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:22,507
I'd try to get some sleep so's to look
fresh and pretty when he meets me.

28
00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:26,712
My daddy don't care how I look,
just so I get there.

29
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:31,289
Shouldn't wonder, ma'am, if the same
advice wouldn't work for you too.

30
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:35,385
<i>You haven't closed your eyes since we
left the railroad. I'm fine, thank you.</i>

31
00:03:38,064 --> 00:03:40,259
Whoa!

32
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:46,502
All right, come out a-jumpin' and reach
for nothin' but sky. Everybody but the kid.

33
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:48,564
Throw your guns overboard
and come down out of there.

34
00:03:48,642 --> 00:03:52,009
We ain't got no gun and we
ain't got no box. Get down!

35
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:56,907
All right, everybody, line up!
And don't anybody try anything!

36
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:59,247
Come on, get over there!

37
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,116
Well, missy, what have
you got there? Nothing.

38
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:03,485
I'll have a look at that satchel.
No!

39
00:04:03,557 --> 00:04:07,391
Boy, I got the tiger by the tail!
A tiger by the tail!

40
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,952
Fine way to make a livin',
robbin' women. Shut up!

41
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:14,125
You're next. That's not
my money. It's collections.

42
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,259
It belongs to-
Shut up!

43
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:49,766
Whoa, horses! Whoa!

44
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:07,515
Whoa! Whoa!

45
00:05:07,587 --> 00:05:10,488
Come on, boy!

46
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:23,260
Come on, Mr. Cole! Come on!
Whoa, horses! Whoa!

47
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:39,308
Whoa!

48
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:42,978
Whoa!

49
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:55,935
Myrtle?
Oh, Mr. Cole, you were elegant!

50
00:05:56,002 --> 00:05:59,961
I bet this old coach had
a mighty scared little passenger.

51
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,702
I was at first, but I ain't now.

52
00:06:02,776 --> 00:06:05,768
All right, you get back inside and
we'll pick up Miss Celia and the others.

53
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:09,406
No, sir.
I wanna ride up there with you.

54
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:11,473
All right, up we go.

55
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:34,603
<i>Here comes the stage!</i>

56
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:48,613
Where you goin',Juke?

57
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:07,833
Where's the Sheriff?
We've been robbed! Sheriff!

58
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:14,379
Help you down?

59
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:17,041
Myrtle! Honey!
Daddy!

60
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:19,745
<i>Look here, let me through here.</i>

61
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:22,219
Celia. Oh, you're good. Oh, Ted.

62
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:24,552
Let me look at you.
How's my kid sister?

63
00:07:24,624 --> 00:07:27,058
Ted. Dear, what's the matter?

64
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:29,561
Did you hear what the driver said?
We were held up.

65
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:32,928
Did they get the money?
Our $10,000, Ted. All of it.

66
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:36,093
Ten thousand dollars?

67
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:39,428
<i>Mr. Cole?</i>

68
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:43,175
What is it, honey?

69
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:46,007
I told Daddy how
you knocked a bandit down...

70
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,947
and caught the runaway
and saved my life.

71
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:52,177
I'm mighty obliged to you,
mister.

72
00:07:52,252 --> 00:07:56,348
If you ever need a friend in Albuquerque,
you got one. Thanks. I'll remember that.

73
00:07:56,422 --> 00:08:01,416
Durn funny, Sheriff. First stage holdup
in months. Why'd they pick on my run?

74
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:04,361
I wasn't carryin' nothin',
not even a gun rider.

75
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,398
Why'd they kill that
poor fella in there?

76
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:09,833
Keep quiet,Juke. Now who were
the passengers in this coach?

77
00:08:09,903 --> 00:08:15,341
Well, I was drivin'. There was
that lady and this fella here,

78
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:18,434
the little gal and that big
fella over there and the dead man.

79
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:22,447
All right, the rest of you scatter.
Go on! Go on about your business!

80
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:29,488
You look intelligent, mister. I'm the sheriff,
and I'd like to know what happened out there.

81
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:34,220
Five men held up the stage, a man was
killed and this lady here lost $10,000.

82
00:08:34,294 --> 00:08:36,319
What's she carryin' that
kind of money around for?

83
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:40,958
I wouldn't think that concerned you or me. If I were
wearing that badge, I'd get a posse and go after them.

84
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:43,298
I didn't ask you
how to run my office.

85
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:46,668
And if you want to stay in this town,
you'd better let me run it.

86
00:08:46,739 --> 00:08:49,765
Hank! Get a couple of men,
take care of this body.

87
00:08:49,843 --> 00:08:52,903
And round up my deputies
and have them meet me here.

88
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:56,471
Remember what I said
about needin' a friend.

89
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:59,040
Good-bye, Mr. Cole.
Good-bye, Myrtle.

90
00:09:03,556 --> 00:09:05,820
I'm sorry about all that money.
Thank you.

91
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:09,328
Mr. Cole, I want you to meet my
brother, Ted Wallace. Mr. Wallace.

92
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:11,795
We've all got a lot to be
grateful to you for, Mr. Cole.

93
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:16,199
Your sister has the name wrong. It's
Cole Armin. I'm here to work for my uncle.

94
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:20,431
John Armin?
Yeah. That's right.

95
00:09:31,684 --> 00:09:35,085
What's the matter with those folks?
You'd think I had smallpox.

96
00:09:35,154 --> 00:09:39,750
Son, I'd rather have smallpox
than the name of Armin in this town.

97
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:52,671
Go on, keep talking.

98
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:55,503
All right, Mr. Armin,
here it is.

99
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:59,807
There's a crowd of men gathering at the jail right
now, yelling their heads off, demanding action.

100
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:02,677
That coach brought a dead body in.
That's murder!

101
00:10:04,117 --> 00:10:09,145
All right. I ordered Matt Wayne
to get that Wallace girl's $10,000.

102
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:12,783
If carrying out that order involved
a killing, that was part of his job.

103
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:17,796
Well, I could cover up the robbery,
but killing, that's something else.

104
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:21,493
Take the outraged citizens
on a horseback tour, Linton.

105
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:26,396
And, Murkil.
Murkil. Murkil!

106
00:10:36,516 --> 00:10:39,883
Get Wayne and his men out of town.
You got it?

107
00:10:40,954 --> 00:10:43,013
Got it.

108
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:47,789
I'm tellin' you the boss is busy and don't
want to be disturbed. Now go on and sit down.

109
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,125
I'm telling you again
I want to see him.

110
00:10:51,197 --> 00:10:55,327
What's all the racket? Ah, this
office boy says I can't seeJohn Armin.

111
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:58,029
You're lookin' at him.

112
00:10:58,104 --> 00:11:00,299
Why, you're notJohn Armin
by 30 years.

113
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:02,238
Have you ever seen him?

114
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:05,141
Yeah, a long time ago.
How do you know I ain't him?

115
00:11:05,211 --> 00:11:07,475
By the size of your ears.

116
00:11:07,547 --> 00:11:10,141
<i>That's gonna get you
thrown out on yours. Murkil!</i>

117
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:15,811
Who are you?
I came to seeJohn Armin.

118
00:11:15,888 --> 00:11:18,015
I'm John Armin.
What do you want?

119
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:21,754
I'm here to take that job you
offered me. What's your name?

120
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:25,195
I was wonderin' when somebody'd
get around to that. I'm Cole Armin.

121
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:28,700
Welcome, Cole.
Welcome to Albuquerque.

122
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:31,794
Get going, Murkil.
This is Ed Linton, our sheriff.

123
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:35,398
Yes. I met him down at the jail. I thought
you were gettin' up a posse, Sheriff.

124
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:38,774
I gave you some good advice down there.
If you're smart, you'll take it.

125
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:43,009
That's why he's here, Cole. Wants to
borrow some of my men to go with him.

126
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:46,779
You know, in Texas,
if the law don't move fast enough,

127
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:50,254
a rope and a tree is the payoff for
robbin' women and cold-blooded shootin'.

128
00:11:50,323 --> 00:11:55,124
I'd be glad to go along, Sheriff. Now you
stay here, Cole. We've got some talking to do.

129
00:11:55,194 --> 00:11:59,096
Get what men you need from the yard,
Linton. Better get going.

130
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,135
<i>Come on in, nephew.
We've got to have a little talk.</i>

131
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:11,107
Just sit down and make
yourself comfortable. Thanks.

132
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:13,509
<i>Quite a place you got here.</i>

133
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:17,743
Uh-huh. Well, how do you think
you're gonna like your new job?

134
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:20,115
I can answer that when
I find out what the job is.

135
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:24,953
Well, I wouldn't send to Texas
for a mule skinner, Cole.

136
00:12:25,024 --> 00:12:27,891
You're stepping in
to a manager's job.

137
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,827
Manager?
Yeah. Help yourself.

138
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:33,127
I've got a big enterprise here.

139
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:37,260
A transportation outfit that hauls
most of the ore down from the mines.

140
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:39,736
I've done the spade work...

141
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:44,334
and the money's rolling in-
big money- but I'm getting tired.

142
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,640
You aim to let me run all that?

143
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:48,680
Soon as you learn the ropes.

144
00:12:48,748 --> 00:12:53,185
Now the teamster is the toughest man
alive, respects nobody he can lick.

145
00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:56,415
And that covers a lot of territory.

146
00:12:56,489 --> 00:13:00,653
<i>It takes plenty of brains and brawn
to handle them. Sounds interesting,</i>

147
00:13:00,726 --> 00:13:02,921
And we have to fight
for contracts too.

148
00:13:02,995 --> 00:13:08,661
<i>That's where everything goes, no
holds barred. Why did you pick me?</i>

149
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:11,669
Because you're an Armin.
Oh.

150
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:14,069
And with another Armin
in the saddle,

151
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:19,942
I can see my empire spreading beyond the
borders of the Territory of New Mexico.

152
00:13:20,012 --> 00:13:23,140
When do I start?
You've already started.

153
00:13:23,216 --> 00:13:25,309
But you'll wanna clean up
a little, I guess. Uh-huh.

154
00:13:25,384 --> 00:13:27,443
Get a room in my hotel,
then come back here.

155
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,616
Thanks. Thanks, UncleJohn.
I'll try to measure up to all that.

156
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:13,528
Now I want you to hit
the Rio Grande bottoms south of town.

157
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:15,726
Spread out and comb the timber, Harry.

158
00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:18,031
All right, Sheriff.
Here we go, men.

159
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:11,013
<i>¶¶</i>

160
00:15:18,064 --> 00:15:21,898
<i>¶¶</i>

161
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:03,203
Hi, old-timer.
Hi.

162
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,405
I didn't know
you were a drinking man.

163
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:10,040
Ordinarily I ain't,
but right now I'm desperate.

164
00:16:10,116 --> 00:16:15,452
Mr. Armin, there comes a time in life
when a man just has to have a drink.

165
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:20,754
You're lookin' at a man seekin'
courage, comfort and confidence.

166
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:23,989
You'll never find it in there.
I'm gonna keep on lookin'.

167
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:29,296
I've been humbled, humiliated,
disgraced and discombobulated, Mr. Armin.

168
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:34,404
Cole's the name. Howdy,
Cole. Mine's Juke.

169
00:16:34,473 --> 00:16:37,169
Howdy,Juke.
What's eating you?

170
00:16:37,243 --> 00:16:40,974
Pearl- fairest of the fair
in all Albuquerque...

171
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:43,277
and the best durn barber
in the territory.

172
00:16:43,349 --> 00:16:45,681
Oh. Lady barber?

173
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:49,118
I called her that once. She run
me down the street with a razor.

174
00:16:49,188 --> 00:16:52,749
She says
she's a tonsorial artist.

175
00:16:52,825 --> 00:16:55,589
Kind of high-toned, huh?
High-toned? Swell-headed.

176
00:16:55,661 --> 00:16:58,789
Has been ever since
she shaved the governor last year.

177
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:01,958
She'd really be tough on you
if she ever shaved the president.

178
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:05,561
Cole, that woman's tried to shave me
every day for nine years.

179
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:07,799
Says I ain't doin'
her business no good.

180
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:10,239
If everybody was like me,
she'd starve to death,

181
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,822
Everybody plays.
On double-O.

182
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:37,100
<i>So this is what's holdin' you up?</i>

183
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:41,799
I told you before that the boss said
for you and your men to get out of town.

184
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:44,843
All right.
Jackson, cash these in.

185
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,935
We're headin' north
to White Spring Canyon.

186
00:17:47,012 --> 00:17:49,572
<i>Make your bets, gents. All right,
everybody plays. All put down together.</i>

187
00:17:51,684 --> 00:17:54,551
Everything goes on number 12.
On number 12.

188
00:18:23,315 --> 00:18:26,443
You gettin' the same idea I am?
Yeah.

189
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:36,087
<i>Number 12.
Yahoo! I won!</i>

190
00:18:36,162 --> 00:18:40,189
<i>I got the tiger by the tail!</i>

191
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:42,632
Seems to me
we've heard that before.

192
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:44,692
We have.

193
00:18:51,877 --> 00:18:56,541
Come on, pay up.
I got the tiger by the tail!

194
00:18:56,615 --> 00:18:58,606
Come on, fella,
we're gonna have a talk.

195
00:18:58,684 --> 00:19:01,551
Speak your piece.
I'm stayin' right where I am.

196
00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:07,020
That's a nasty cut.
Kind of fresh too.

197
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:09,720
Hold it, mister.

198
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:14,122
Get back there, all of you!
You too!

199
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:20,036
This is private and personal between
my friend and that scorpion there.

200
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:25,168
If living means anything to you, you
got a lot of talking to do. Let go of me!

201
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:28,372
<i>Come on, there!
Come on, let me through there!</i>

202
00:19:28,447 --> 00:19:32,474
Open up! That scorpion's gonna have
a little talk with my partner...

203
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:36,248
or he ain't gonna twist
no more tiger's tail.

204
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:52,201
Well, it didn't take you long.

205
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:55,399
I want Miss Wallace's $10,000.

206
00:19:55,474 --> 00:19:57,669
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.

207
00:19:57,743 --> 00:20:00,234
The money your thugs took off
of that girl on the stagecoach.

208
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:03,213
<i>Oh, you know about that?
Yes.</i>

209
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:07,378
Supposing they did? The Wallaces
are our competitors, Cole.

210
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:10,945
And you'd rob a woman,
kill an innocent man to destroy them?

211
00:20:11,023 --> 00:20:14,584
The law of self-preservation
applies to business too.

212
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,855
The competition
has got to be strangled.

213
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:21,593
<i>So the end justifies the means?
That's not important.</i>

214
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:24,397
Life is cheap out here.

215
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,531
The money itself had
no value to me... as money.

216
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:33,738
But don't you see, Cole? It would have
set Wallace up as a dangerous threat to us.

217
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:37,805
I'm building a big business here
that'll be yours someday.

218
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:43,651
<i>Wallace's 10,000 got in my way,
so I removed it.</i>

219
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:46,316
Now I understand why our name
is poison in Albuquerque.

220
00:20:46,392 --> 00:20:51,591
You're too emotional,just like
your father. That's why he died poor.

221
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:53,928
Never mind that.
I want that girl's money.

222
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,230
I don't stand for threats, Cole.

223
00:20:57,303 --> 00:21:01,637
And if you got any ideas of calling on
the law, it'll be your word against mine.

224
00:21:01,707 --> 00:21:04,073
What about the word
of your hired killer?

225
00:21:08,948 --> 00:21:13,908
- He won't talk.
- If he don't want to shake hands with sudden death, he'll talk.

226
00:21:13,986 --> 00:21:17,854
There's a mob with a rope looking for you.
You want to talk to them or to the law?

227
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:22,654
Take him to the sheriff,Juke.
Tell him I said to lock him up.

228
00:21:22,728 --> 00:21:27,756
I wish Pearl was here to see what a
useful citizen I've turned out to be.

229
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,767
Come on, get movin'.

230
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:32,736
Let's you and I have
another little talk, eh, Cole?

231
00:21:34,873 --> 00:21:36,807
Do you want to save
any of these, Ted?

232
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:41,812
No, burn 'em all up. I don't want to save a scrap of
anything to remind me of this place or anybody in it.

233
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:51,545
How do you suppose Mr. Armin knew
I was bringing the money?

234
00:21:51,624 --> 00:21:53,922
He's got connections
all over this territory.

235
00:21:53,993 --> 00:21:57,258
And his nephew being on the same stage
wasn't just a coincidence.

236
00:21:57,329 --> 00:22:01,231
Just because his name is Cole Armin
doesn't convict him with me.

237
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,530
Look...

238
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:08,062
instead of using the money we have left to
go home, couldn't we make a fresh start here?

239
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,007
What with? The only start we
can make, honey, is back home,

240
00:22:11,076 --> 00:22:13,010
or go to work forJohn Armin.

241
00:22:13,078 --> 00:22:16,479
Armin! Armin! Armin!
That's all I've heard since I got here.

242
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:20,245
Albuquerque could grow into a big city
someday, and you could grow with it.

243
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:23,584
It's the fear of his power that's strangling
you and everybody else in this town.

244
00:22:23,656 --> 00:22:26,318
I not gonna stand by
and watch you quit.

245
00:22:29,461 --> 00:22:31,656
Is this the Wallace Freighting Company?

246
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,961
Ted! It was
the Wallace Freighting Company.

247
00:22:35,034 --> 00:22:38,026
You've got nothing to say
that we want to hear. Get out!

248
00:22:38,103 --> 00:22:40,037
Miss Celia, I don't want to fight
any more today.

249
00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:42,471
<i>Will you ask your brother
to sit down and listen?</i>

250
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:43,872
Sit down, Ted.

251
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:50,004
I came here thinking you might
need some help. What kind of help?

252
00:22:50,082 --> 00:22:54,018
<i>I could learn to drive mules. Is this
another one of your uncle's schemes?</i>

253
00:22:54,086 --> 00:22:56,782
Well, I just came from him,
but he didn't send me.

254
00:22:56,855 --> 00:23:01,189
I'm interested in this town and its possibilities.
Matter of fact, I'm looking for a job.

255
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,820
You heard what my sister said.
We're out of business.

256
00:23:03,896 --> 00:23:05,921
Maybe this will put you
back in business.

257
00:23:08,534 --> 00:23:12,595
Our money. How did you
- You'll find it all there.

258
00:23:12,671 --> 00:23:17,870
I don't know how to thank you. I can tell you
how, by selling me an interest in your company.

259
00:23:17,943 --> 00:23:22,846
You mean you want to be
partners with us? I reckon.

260
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:26,009
Mister, you've made a deal.

261
00:23:26,085 --> 00:23:28,349
The Wallace-Armin Freighting Company.

262
00:23:56,615 --> 00:23:59,049
Sheriff! Sheriff!

263
00:24:01,787 --> 00:24:05,245
Jackson, I'm not going to
tell you again. Stop that noise.

264
00:24:05,324 --> 00:24:07,258
I ain't started makin' noise yet.

265
00:24:07,326 --> 00:24:10,295
When I do, everyone will hear me,
including the United States Marshal.

266
00:24:10,362 --> 00:24:15,766
You can tell Armin and tell him this-
I ain't aimin' to go to no gallows alone.

267
00:24:21,507 --> 00:24:26,467
<i>Walking from here to Chicago and back doesn't do my
carpet any good. Besides, it doesn't solve anything.</i>

268
00:24:26,545 --> 00:24:30,504
What am I gonna do about thatJackson?
How am I gonna keep him quiet?

269
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:35,076
So you got a prisoner who threatens to make
trouble. I think we can handle that situation.

270
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:43,253
What about them lamps burning
all night in the Wallace office,

271
00:24:43,328 --> 00:24:46,092
their stockade bustin'
with mules and new equipment?

272
00:24:46,165 --> 00:24:49,601
I tell you there's somethin' goin'
on over there. Oh, I know all that.

273
00:24:49,668 --> 00:24:52,262
What I want to know is,
what do they got in the fire?

274
00:24:52,337 --> 00:24:56,740
What their contacts are? What their bids
are? I want a report from the inside.

275
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,401
How you gonna get it?

276
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:04,438
The party who's gonna attend to that
is on the way here now-

277
00:25:04,516 --> 00:25:06,711
so stop worrying...

278
00:25:06,785 --> 00:25:08,776
and get off my desk!

279
00:25:12,157 --> 00:25:16,150
¶¶

280
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:23,231
<i>¶ Gonna run all night ¶</i>

281
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:25,463
¶ Gonna run all day ¶

282
00:25:25,537 --> 00:25:27,664
¶ Bet my money on a bob-tailed nag ¶

283
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:30,435
¶ Somebody bet on the bay ¶¶

284
00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:32,443
Hey, wait a minute!

285
00:25:32,511 --> 00:25:35,878
What are you tryin' to do, scald me
tender enough to pick my pin feathers?

286
00:25:35,948 --> 00:25:38,610
Listen, you, you're having
supper with nice folks...

287
00:25:38,684 --> 00:25:40,743
and you don't to want to
smell like a mule, do you?

288
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:43,720
Well, I ain't aimin' to stay
after vittles anyhow.

289
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:47,850
I gotta meet Pearl when she closes
her Tonsorial Parlor. Yeah.

290
00:25:50,329 --> 00:25:53,059
What are you lookin' at me
like that for?

291
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:56,259
Juke, there's a sheriff looking
for you somewhere. Where? Where?

292
00:25:56,335 --> 00:25:59,270
Ah, what'd you say that for?

293
00:25:59,338 --> 00:26:04,469
Nobody'd hide behind that foliage you're wearin'
unless he was playing hooky from somebody's jail.

294
00:26:04,543 --> 00:26:07,011
Now ain't that a nice thing to say.

295
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:11,675
Here I agree to work with you fellas,
take you into my home and-

296
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:16,653
Say, how do I know how many sheriffs
is chasin' you around the country?

297
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:22,492
I'm gettin' that look again.
What does it mean this time?

298
00:26:22,561 --> 00:26:24,324
This time it means
I'm gonna cut your hair.

299
00:26:24,396 --> 00:26:27,888
No, sir! You ain't gonna
do no such a durn thing now!

300
00:26:27,966 --> 00:26:30,764
Stay away from me with them
sheep shears. Go on now.

301
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:33,964
Hey, who's this
awful-looking character? Huh?

302
00:26:35,173 --> 00:26:39,576
Character? Why, doggone it, that's
me without my whiskers. Yeah.

303
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:51,111
Cole, this is gonna be a secret
just twixt you and me, huh?

304
00:27:13,078 --> 00:27:15,137
<i>You fellas ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.</i>

305
00:27:15,213 --> 00:27:18,910
That costs plenty of money. Oh, I don't
know what you fellas are worrying about.

306
00:27:18,984 --> 00:27:24,923
You got wagons, mules, men, money enough
for wages and feed till you get goin'.

307
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:29,984
I guess that ought to show John Armin you mean
business, eh, Cole? I reckon you're right,Juke.

308
00:27:30,062 --> 00:27:34,294
But I'm just realizing how much I gotta
learn about this ore-freighting business.

309
00:27:34,366 --> 00:27:36,664
Ted, where is that Half-High mine
you're talking about?

310
00:27:36,735 --> 00:27:38,669
It's a lot easier to show you
on the map. Come on.

311
00:27:38,737 --> 00:27:41,729
That'll give you a better idea.
Uh-huh.

312
00:27:43,241 --> 00:27:45,175
Now this is the road to the mine. Yeah.

313
00:27:45,243 --> 00:27:47,871
<i>It's the only way up.</i>

314
00:27:47,946 --> 00:27:50,176
That looks like
a tough place to get to.

315
00:27:50,248 --> 00:27:53,046
Oh, gettin' up ain't the problem.
It's gettin' down with 10-mule wagons.

316
00:27:53,118 --> 00:27:56,178
Yep. Well, that's the only way
you can make it pay,

317
00:27:56,254 --> 00:27:59,781
Those big wagons with trailers on that
steep and narrow road? Sure looks dangerous.

318
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:03,225
Oh, of course it's dangerous, but
if Armin can do it, you can. Armin?

319
00:28:03,295 --> 00:28:06,696
He's got Huggins, the owner, by the throat.
Nobody else in town would touch the haul.

320
00:28:06,765 --> 00:28:09,700
So he gets his own price. Can't
we underbid him and make it pay?

321
00:28:09,768 --> 00:28:11,702
Enough to keep us goin',
that's about all.

322
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:15,934
<i>But if we can save money for Huggins,
other owners will line up on our side.</i>

323
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:20,570
<i>Why, it seems like to me
we ought to pay Mr. Huggins a visit.</i>

324
00:28:20,645 --> 00:28:24,376
Listen, you men, you come and eat this
supper right now or I'll feed it to the mules.

325
00:28:24,449 --> 00:28:28,112
Yeah, go on. Get over there.
Go on, go on. You too. You too.

326
00:28:28,186 --> 00:28:30,279
You fellas ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.

327
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:33,586
Here Miss Celia's been slavin'
over a hot stove all day...

328
00:28:33,658 --> 00:28:36,388
mixin' fancy vittles
for you galoots.

329
00:28:36,461 --> 00:28:38,395
Ah, quiet,Juke.
You talk too much.

330
00:28:38,463 --> 00:28:40,397
That's his association
with Damon and Pythias.

331
00:28:40,465 --> 00:28:43,730
Hey, wait a minute. If that road isn't
wide enough for two wagons to pass,

332
00:28:43,802 --> 00:28:47,169
what do you do when you meet one
coming down? You don't pass anybody.

333
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:52,267
You see, there's a flag on top that's raised
as a warning if somebody's comin' down.

334
00:28:52,344 --> 00:28:55,211
We do the same thing
at the bottom if we're goin' up.

335
00:28:57,282 --> 00:28:59,409
Eat your supper, boys!

336
00:29:06,024 --> 00:29:08,925
Evenin', Sheriff.
Wait a minute, Harvey.

337
00:29:08,994 --> 00:29:11,792
Leave it here. I'll take
it in to him. Suits me.

338
00:29:11,863 --> 00:29:14,889
ThatJackson don't look none too tame to
me anyway. He needs a lot of watchin'.

339
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:17,992
Yeah. Good night, Sheriff.
Good night.

340
00:29:42,928 --> 00:29:44,919
Here's your supper,Jackson.

341
00:29:47,265 --> 00:29:51,395
Now listen, when I leave,
I'm gonna forget to lock you in.

342
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,665
That door's open.
There's a horse waitin' for you.

343
00:29:53,738 --> 00:29:56,571
You get aboard
and out of Albuquerque, fast.

344
00:29:56,641 --> 00:29:59,474
Well, you must of
got my message to Armin.

345
00:29:59,544 --> 00:30:03,776
When I come back in five minutes, I
don't wanna find anybody here, understand?

346
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,384
What's the matter, Sheriff?
What happened?

347
00:31:14,452 --> 00:31:18,013
You can see, can't you? This fella
Jackson broke out of jail and I shot him.

348
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:23,083
I reckon trouble's over for him, but it
might just be startin' for some folks.

349
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:25,356
What do you mean by that?

350
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:29,457
Nothing. Only sometimes
dead men leave ghosts behind 'em.

351
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:36,798
That's an awfully good supper,
Miss Celia. I'm glad you enjoyed it.

352
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:40,276
Uh-oh. I'm warning you now. You can't
hold me responsible for any casualties.

353
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:42,279
This is my first experience
in an apron.

354
00:31:42,347 --> 00:31:44,941
Uh-uh!
Huh? Oh.

355
00:31:45,016 --> 00:31:47,007
You're doing fine.

356
00:31:48,253 --> 00:31:52,189
Uh-oh.
I think I spoke too soon.

357
00:31:52,257 --> 00:31:55,784
Well, at least this is one
less dish to dry. I'm sorry.

358
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,988
It was Ted's fault.
He said you could do anything.

359
00:31:59,064 --> 00:32:03,626
Hmm. You know, that, uh,
brother of yours is all right.

360
00:32:03,702 --> 00:32:05,761
He's all the family I have left.

361
00:32:05,837 --> 00:32:08,897
When Ted came out West
and got started in this business,

362
00:32:08,974 --> 00:32:11,408
I sold the home back East
and joined him.

363
00:32:11,476 --> 00:32:13,967
I reckon he found
the goin' pretty tough.

364
00:32:14,045 --> 00:32:16,343
He found your uncle
running the whole town.

365
00:32:16,414 --> 00:32:19,247
Riding herd on the
little fella, huh? Yes.

366
00:32:19,317 --> 00:32:23,083
I hope you won't be sorry
you joined us against him.

367
00:32:23,154 --> 00:32:27,420
There's a fella in jail I'm figurin' on
takin' the jingle out of my uncle's spurs.

368
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:30,120
I'm sticking to my deal, Celia.

369
00:32:30,195 --> 00:32:32,595
I thought you'd feel like that, Cole.

370
00:32:43,241 --> 00:32:46,642
Cole? Cole?
Where is everybody here?

371
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:52,112
The sheriff just shotJackson
makin' a getaway on a horse. What?

372
00:32:52,183 --> 00:32:55,414
Yeah. I'm afraid your uncle's
spurs are still jingling.

373
00:33:01,493 --> 00:33:03,427
Now I agree with Ted here.

374
00:33:03,495 --> 00:33:08,228
We have the equipment and drivers and can guarantee
the delivery of paying loads to the mill...

375
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,791
at a price attractive to you
and profitable to us.

376
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:13,770
Experience is more important
than equipment, Mr. Armin.

377
00:33:13,838 --> 00:33:17,774
When a wagon train leaves our mine,
we've got to know it'll get to the mill.

378
00:33:17,842 --> 00:33:20,470
I can answer for that.
I drove the haul for Walton.

379
00:33:20,545 --> 00:33:25,039
I know every foot and every hazard.
And now we've gotJuke with us. Yes, sir.

380
00:33:25,116 --> 00:33:30,076
Ted'll be on the lead wagon. I'll be
right behind him with Damon and Pythias.

381
00:33:30,155 --> 00:33:35,787
Why, I could make that run
with a piano on the back of every mule,

382
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,351
pail of water in each hand
and another on my head.

383
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:41,524
Mr. Clark, what about a deal?

384
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:45,501
Well, now wait a minute. Mr. Huggins,
our manager, feels you're new here.

385
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:48,539
He wants me to show you what
you're headin' into. Come here.

386
00:33:48,606 --> 00:33:50,870
I saw it.
I rode up here, you know.

387
00:33:58,783 --> 00:34:01,809
What's that mine up there?
Angel's Roost.

388
00:34:01,886 --> 00:34:05,151
Angel's Roost, huh? But I wouldn't
get too ambitious, Mr. Armin.

389
00:34:05,223 --> 00:34:07,191
It's the richest strike
in New Mexico,

390
00:34:07,258 --> 00:34:10,352
but the road up there
is just plain murder.

391
00:34:11,363 --> 00:34:15,094
<i>Who's got that contract?
Nobody. They're afraid to try it.</i>

392
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:17,600
Why'd you work the property
if you couldn't get the ore down?

393
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:20,263
Well, Huggins had a deal
with John Armin.

394
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:25,002
<i>He agreed if we sunk a shaft he'd get
the ore to the mill. What happened?</i>

395
00:34:25,076 --> 00:34:27,874
Well, we like to broke our company
digging in up there.

396
00:34:27,946 --> 00:34:30,210
And when we were ready to go,
Armin welshed.

397
00:34:30,281 --> 00:34:32,977
<i>Tried to hold us up
on the hauling price.</i>

398
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:36,077
<i>I reckon he figured on breaking us
then takin'it over himself.</i>

399
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:16,920
Howdy, lady.
Welcome to Albuquerque.

400
00:35:16,995 --> 00:35:19,156
Thank you.

401
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,630
Could you tell me
whereJohn Armin's office is?

402
00:35:21,699 --> 00:35:24,566
Straight down the street. Monarch
Building. You can't miss it.

403
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:57,190
Bed 'em down,Juke. I'll put the contracts
in the safe. I'll tell Celia the good news.

404
00:35:57,268 --> 00:36:00,237
<i>Tell her to put the coffee pot on.
Right.</i>

405
00:36:12,016 --> 00:36:14,007
<i>Put 'em up.</i>

406
00:36:16,955 --> 00:36:19,423
Get over here and open up this
safe. There's no money in it.

407
00:36:19,491 --> 00:36:21,482
Open it up!

408
00:36:29,234 --> 00:36:31,225
Well!

409
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,138
Cole! Cole!

410
00:36:41,513 --> 00:36:44,175
What happened? Where was
that shot? The office.

411
00:36:46,851 --> 00:36:48,785
What's the shooting, Ted?

412
00:36:48,853 --> 00:36:51,686
A hold-up man jumped me when this young
lady came in and started blazing away.

413
00:36:51,756 --> 00:36:53,690
Where's the body?
Just went through that door.

414
00:36:53,758 --> 00:36:57,250
We can't have no bodies runnin'
around loose in Albuquerque.

415
00:37:00,899 --> 00:37:04,665
I'm afraid I'm not a very good
shot. Good or bad, it was timely.

416
00:37:04,736 --> 00:37:08,137
You always carry a gun, lady?
It came in handy tonight.

417
00:37:08,206 --> 00:37:10,174
Just happen to be
passing by?

418
00:37:10,241 --> 00:37:15,645
Yes. I only arrived in Albuquerque today.
I'm looking for work. I'm Letty Tyler.

419
00:37:15,713 --> 00:37:17,647
Work? What kind of work?

420
00:37:17,715 --> 00:37:21,515
Oh, bookkeeping,
correspondence, payroll.

421
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:23,781
I think I could make myself
generally useful.

422
00:37:23,855 --> 00:37:27,848
We'll need some help, Cole. Now that we've got
the Huggins's contract, we expect to get others.

423
00:37:27,926 --> 00:37:31,657
We're certainly grateful to you, Miss Tyler,
though I'm afraid we couldn't pay you much at first.

424
00:37:31,729 --> 00:37:34,425
Well, I'm sure I could make out
on whatever you could afford.

425
00:37:34,499 --> 00:37:37,935
Well, what do you say, boys? It's all
right with me. What do you say, Cole?

426
00:37:38,002 --> 00:37:41,165
I'm just a junior partner.
Whatever the seniors decide.

427
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:43,935
Then you can start in the morning.
We'll be busy with the Half-High haul.

428
00:37:44,008 --> 00:37:46,442
So, Celia, you can sort of acquaint
her with things until we get back.

429
00:37:46,511 --> 00:37:51,039
Fine. I was about to make some coffee.
Won't you join us? Thank you. I'd love to.

430
00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:55,079
Lock up the Huggins's contract,
will you, Cole? It's on the safe.

431
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:28,878
I had him opening the safe
when the gal walked in.

432
00:38:28,953 --> 00:38:32,616
<i>Your idea worked out
just like you said, Mr. Armin.</i>

433
00:38:40,465 --> 00:38:43,025
Well, I got the job.
Did you find out anything?

434
00:38:43,101 --> 00:38:45,035
Yes. They're nice people.

435
00:38:45,103 --> 00:38:48,903
I wasn't asking about their social
qualities. What are they up to?

436
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:53,376
They've got a contract. The first haul
comes off in the morning- the Half-High mine.

437
00:38:57,348 --> 00:39:00,442
I want to congratulate the both of you
on a job well done.

438
00:39:00,518 --> 00:39:02,486
Sit down, Miss Tyler.

439
00:39:02,553 --> 00:39:06,990
I can see now that our association is
going to be quite profitable to both of us.

440
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:33,943
Looks all right,Juke.
There's no flag showing on top.

441
00:39:34,018 --> 00:39:35,952
Well, that gives us the right-of-way.

442
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,181
What are we waitin' for?
Let's get goin'.

443
00:40:53,097 --> 00:40:55,588
What are you doin'
on this road, Murkil?

444
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:58,032
Hi, Wallace.
Funny place to meet up, ain't it?

445
00:40:58,102 --> 00:41:02,869
<i>You didn't raise no flag on the top. That
gives us the right-of-way. Flag or no flag,</i>

446
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,841
<i>the right-of-way belongs to anybody
that can take it. Put down that gun.</i>

447
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:15,142
And the other one too.

448
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:19,048
I guess you had things
figured about right, Cole.

449
00:41:19,123 --> 00:41:21,057
Figured?

450
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:25,824
You didn't think your boss was the only
Armin in town that could figure, did you?

451
00:41:25,897 --> 00:41:28,127
Both of you get down
and unhitch those horses.

452
00:41:42,146 --> 00:41:44,876
The bookkeeper's job doesn't
include janitor work, Letty.

453
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:47,281
Oh, I'm just sort of
clearing the decks for action.

454
00:41:47,351 --> 00:41:49,842
Ted won't know the place
all cleaned up.

455
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:51,912
You think they'll get that ore
down safely today?

456
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:55,152
Ted and Juke are the best drivers in
the territory. They'll bring it down.

457
00:41:55,226 --> 00:41:59,026
Oh, I'm sure they will. I haven't
seen Cole Armin today. He go along?

458
00:41:59,096 --> 00:42:02,691
Oh, no. He doesn't drive.
He had some other business.

459
00:42:02,767 --> 00:42:06,259
Probably lining up some new
contracts, huh? Probably.

460
00:42:08,206 --> 00:42:10,140
He's awfully nice, isn't he?

461
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:14,508
<i>Seems to be.
Handsome too.</i>

462
00:42:21,485 --> 00:42:24,249
They made it, Letty!
They made it!

463
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,331
<i>Hey, Murkil, helpin' Wallace
bring the ore in?</i>

464
00:42:41,505 --> 00:42:44,565
<i>That's the funniest thing I ever did see.</i>

465
00:42:44,642 --> 00:42:46,576
<i>Did you have a nice trip, Murkil?</i>

466
00:42:46,644 --> 00:42:49,511
<i>They oughta build a monument to you!</i>

467
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:53,482
<i>This town is sure proud of you,
I'll say that!</i>

468
00:44:04,956 --> 00:44:08,323
What's that for? They call
this a wishing well, don't they?

469
00:44:08,392 --> 00:44:11,122
Well, I'm buying a wish
for a dollar.

470
00:44:11,195 --> 00:44:14,289
And if I ask your wish and you tell it,
then it won't come true.

471
00:44:14,365 --> 00:44:16,629
That's part of the legend,
too, isn't it? Reckon.

472
00:44:16,701 --> 00:44:19,795
Mind if I ask you something else?

473
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:21,895
Not if you keep
looking at that dollar.

474
00:44:23,474 --> 00:44:25,772
Think you're gonna
like Albuquerque?

475
00:44:25,843 --> 00:44:27,834
Reckon.
I'm glad.

476
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:33,578
I'm glad for a lot of things that have
happened to me lately. Before Albuquerque?

477
00:44:33,651 --> 00:44:36,085
Keep looking at that dollar.

478
00:44:36,153 --> 00:44:42,058
You know, Celia, sometimes a single face or person
will change the whole way of a man's living and-

479
00:44:45,596 --> 00:44:49,794
and he starts wishing for things
that never occurred to him before.

480
00:44:49,867 --> 00:44:53,667
If your wishes and wants are real
enough, they'll come in search of you.

481
00:44:53,738 --> 00:44:57,196
I wish I could believe that.

482
00:44:57,274 --> 00:45:00,937
Sometimes a man has to ask
for what he wants.

483
00:45:01,012 --> 00:45:03,276
Tell me about Texas.

484
00:45:03,347 --> 00:45:07,716
Well, there's an awful lot of it
and lonely sometimes.

485
00:45:07,785 --> 00:45:11,346
Funny part is,
I never knew how lonely.

486
00:45:11,422 --> 00:45:13,390
Keep watching that dollar.

487
00:45:15,126 --> 00:45:17,458
When did you find out
it was lonely?

488
00:45:17,528 --> 00:45:20,463
In El Paso, when you stepped
into that stagecoach.

489
00:45:21,532 --> 00:45:23,864
And I found out
something else too-

490
00:45:23,934 --> 00:45:27,927
that I needed someone
to share this business of living.

491
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,704
Oh, why don't you ask me, Cole?

492
00:45:36,614 --> 00:45:40,209
<i>You're pretty good with that whip.</i>

493
00:45:40,284 --> 00:45:44,721
A real expert could wrap it around a man's
throat at 20 feet, strangle him to death.

494
00:45:44,789 --> 00:45:47,724
That could be a dangerous
weapon. That's right.

495
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:50,727
I can certainly think of more pleasant
things to talk about. Thank you.

496
00:45:50,795 --> 00:45:52,888
Like what?

497
00:45:52,963 --> 00:45:55,158
Tell me, Ted,
how did Cole know...

498
00:45:55,232 --> 00:45:57,996
that Armin's men were going to stop
you yesterday on the Half-High ride?

499
00:45:58,069 --> 00:46:01,664
Oh, he didn't know. You see, Cole
used to ride with the Texas Rangers.

500
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:03,832
They had a rule:
whenever they expected trouble,

501
00:46:03,908 --> 00:46:07,002
they'd send a scout ahead
before they'd expose their whole troop.

502
00:46:07,078 --> 00:46:09,012
He borrowed that idea
from them.

503
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,674
Pretty smart thinking.
Oh, he's a smart fella.

504
00:46:11,749 --> 00:46:13,683
We're sure lucky
we got him.

505
00:46:13,751 --> 00:46:16,481
We got big plans
for spreading out.

506
00:46:16,554 --> 00:46:18,488
Uh, spreading out?

507
00:46:18,556 --> 00:46:21,024
Well, you're practically
one of the firm-

508
00:46:21,092 --> 00:46:23,356
I guess there's no harm
in telling you.

509
00:46:23,427 --> 00:46:27,363
But if I have my way, we're going
after the Angel's Roost contract.

510
00:46:27,431 --> 00:46:30,366
Your way?
Well, Cole's afraid-

511
00:46:30,434 --> 00:46:33,699
that is, he's afraid for the animals,
men and equipment.

512
00:46:33,771 --> 00:46:37,366
But I'll be driving that lead wagon,
and I know I can bring 'em through.

513
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:40,433
I'll be pulling for you, Ted.
Then how can I lose?

514
00:46:58,129 --> 00:47:00,290
<i>Buenos dias, amigo.
Buenos dias.</i>

515
00:47:05,035 --> 00:47:07,230
Juke, what in the world
are you dressed like that for?

516
00:47:07,304 --> 00:47:10,068
Aw, it's an idea of Pearl's.

517
00:47:10,141 --> 00:47:12,473
She said she wouldn't go to
the shindig at the mission...

518
00:47:12,543 --> 00:47:15,034
unless I got all rigged up like this.

519
00:47:15,112 --> 00:47:17,512
I'm supposed to be a " trooby-door. "

520
00:47:17,581 --> 00:47:20,744
<i>Troubadour.
Yeah, trooby-door.</i>

521
00:47:20,818 --> 00:47:23,787
Somebody blew it up-
the Half-High mine!

522
00:47:23,854 --> 00:47:27,017
The Half-High mine-
somebody blew it up!

523
00:47:27,091 --> 00:47:30,026
Tell Pearl I couldn't wait.
Hyah! Get outta the way!

524
00:47:30,094 --> 00:47:32,858
Get outta the way, folks!
Hyah! Get outta the way!

525
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:34,921
Giddyap!

526
00:47:45,276 --> 00:47:47,267
<i>Move it! Hyah!</i>

527
00:47:52,783 --> 00:47:54,774
Cole! Ted!

528
00:47:57,521 --> 00:47:59,455
Welcome to the family.

529
00:47:59,523 --> 00:48:01,388
That's the best news I've
heard in years. Thanks.

530
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:04,154
I hope you'll be awfully happy.
Thanks. I'm sure we will be.

531
00:48:04,228 --> 00:48:06,526
<i>Cole!</i>

532
00:48:06,597 --> 00:48:08,656
Cole! Ted!

533
00:48:11,435 --> 00:48:14,029
The Half-High's been blowed up!
What?

534
00:48:14,104 --> 00:48:16,231
<i>Half-High?
Mm.</i>

535
00:48:17,775 --> 00:48:20,972
What's next, Cole?
Angel's Roost.

536
00:48:36,627 --> 00:48:38,891
Young fella,
what you propose is impossible.

537
00:48:38,963 --> 00:48:43,024
But, Mr. Huggins, your loss of the Half-High
mine might put us out of business too.

538
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,364
That's why we're forced
to tackle Angel's Roost.

539
00:48:45,436 --> 00:48:49,429
Twenty ton of ore slipping and sliding
in that shale on a narrow road...

540
00:48:49,506 --> 00:48:52,771
with only a prayer between you
and a drop of 5,000 feet?

541
00:48:52,843 --> 00:48:55,209
No, you'd never make it.
It's a road, isn't it?

542
00:48:55,279 --> 00:48:58,680
Not one that'll hold a 20-ton load
in that shale with 12 mules.

543
00:48:58,749 --> 00:49:02,913
<i>Walton tried it and lost wagons,
mules and men. We still wanna try it.</i>

544
00:49:02,987 --> 00:49:05,114
Have you got that kind
of equipment and drivers?

545
00:49:05,189 --> 00:49:07,157
<i>Give us a week. We'll have
'em. You can count on it.</i>

546
00:49:07,224 --> 00:49:11,661
Just a minute. It'll have to be
10 wagons. Nothing less will pay.

547
00:49:11,729 --> 00:49:14,323
Ten wagons?
Yup. If you come through,

548
00:49:14,398 --> 00:49:16,696
there'll be a contract
waiting for you at the mill.

549
00:49:16,767 --> 00:49:18,701
But I still think
you're crazy to try it.

550
00:49:18,769 --> 00:49:22,705
Mr. Huggins, your people have extensive
holdings all over this territory.

551
00:49:22,773 --> 00:49:27,710
Now, if we make good on this haul, we'll expect you
to give us a chance at the rest of your business.

552
00:49:27,778 --> 00:49:30,042
Just have that mill ready
a week from today.

553
00:49:30,114 --> 00:49:32,878
It'll be ready.
Here's a warning.

554
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:37,387
Just between us, we're not satisfied
that Half-High explosion was an accident.

555
00:49:37,454 --> 00:49:40,048
Neither are we.
Come on, Ted.

556
00:49:40,124 --> 00:49:42,524
Good luck, boys. Thank
you. See you at the mine.

557
00:49:42,593 --> 00:49:43,685
Yeah.

558
00:49:47,197 --> 00:49:50,496
Hope we didn't bite off more than we
can chew. Aw, we got plenty of time.

559
00:50:02,313 --> 00:50:05,510
Is it bad, Ted?
It's my leg.

560
00:50:12,222 --> 00:50:15,385
Let me through here.
What's going on? Who shot him?

561
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:17,723
The man who shot him is dead.

562
00:50:17,795 --> 00:50:21,891
And you can tellJohn Armin that anyone else he
sends after us can expect the same treatment.

563
00:50:21,965 --> 00:50:24,365
What's John Armin
gotta do with it?

564
00:50:24,435 --> 00:50:27,768
You oughta know that better than any man
in Albuquerque. You're working for him.

565
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:31,604
That's pretty wild talk.
That's not talk. It's a warning.

566
00:50:31,675 --> 00:50:33,609
The next move
Armin makes against us,

567
00:50:33,677 --> 00:50:37,443
we'll wipe him out if it means killing every one
of this thugs and burning his place to the ground.

568
00:50:37,514 --> 00:50:39,846
Warren,
help me to get him home.

569
00:50:42,653 --> 00:50:45,918
I don't want any more protests
from you, Miss Tyler.

570
00:50:45,989 --> 00:50:50,926
Any consequences that follow your job,
I'll back you up.

571
00:50:50,994 --> 00:50:54,122
But, in case
you get any righteous ideas,

572
00:50:54,198 --> 00:50:58,100
<i>you're a criminal accessory
to anything that happens.</i>

573
00:50:58,168 --> 00:51:00,261
<i>Don't forget that.</i>

574
00:51:00,337 --> 00:51:04,034
Any scruples I might have had went on
the bargain counter when I took this job,

575
00:51:04,108 --> 00:51:06,576
but you can count me out
of any more murder plans.

576
00:51:06,643 --> 00:51:10,875
I give the orders here.
I make the conditions.

577
00:51:10,948 --> 00:51:13,883
You've got your instructions.
Carry them out.

578
00:51:15,386 --> 00:51:17,320
I'm still working for you.

579
00:51:23,627 --> 00:51:28,724
So, my nephew threatens
to burn me out of business.

580
00:51:28,799 --> 00:51:31,632
Hmm. Yes.

581
00:51:35,472 --> 00:51:38,066
<i>Is he gonna be all right,
Doctor?</i>

582
00:51:38,142 --> 00:51:41,236
You needn't expect him to be on
his feet for a couple of months yet.

583
00:51:41,311 --> 00:51:43,905
That bullet split the femur
right through.

584
00:51:43,981 --> 00:51:46,916
Mm. Split the what?

585
00:51:46,984 --> 00:51:49,782
<i>The femur- the thigh bone.</i>

586
00:51:49,853 --> 00:51:51,912
Right now,
he's sufferin' from shock.

587
00:51:51,989 --> 00:51:54,924
Needs rest, plenty of it.

588
00:51:54,992 --> 00:51:57,256
That means no talking.

589
00:51:57,327 --> 00:51:59,659
I'll look in again
in the morning.

590
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:02,528
I guess that finishes us
for the Angel's Roost contract.

591
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:06,695
Now, why does it? Huh. To listen to him talk,
you'd think he's the only driver in New Mexico.

592
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:08,965
Yeah.
Look, Ted.

593
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:10,973
You can run the business
right from here.

594
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:14,374
Juke can get all the drivers and
we'll still make that run on schedule.

595
00:52:14,445 --> 00:52:16,675
Make it ahead of schedule.

596
00:52:16,747 --> 00:52:18,806
<i>Juke,you stay here and help Celia.</i>

597
00:52:18,882 --> 00:52:20,816
<i>Where you going?</i>

598
00:52:20,884 --> 00:52:22,943
I've got some private business
to attend to.

599
00:53:22,212 --> 00:53:24,203
Won't you come in?

600
00:53:28,485 --> 00:53:31,079
<i>Well, what can I do for you?</i>

601
00:53:31,154 --> 00:53:34,089
I just picked these up
atJohn Armin's place.

602
00:53:34,157 --> 00:53:37,558
Was I supposed to find them
or are you getting careless?

603
00:53:37,628 --> 00:53:39,960
That's one you'll have to
figure out for yourself.

604
00:53:50,974 --> 00:53:53,272
What's that for?

605
00:53:53,343 --> 00:53:55,334
I was just figuring.

606
00:53:55,412 --> 00:54:00,577
You must've needed the job bad to fire blank
cartridges at a hired bandit in a fake holdup.

607
00:54:00,651 --> 00:54:05,611
I needed a job bad. I didn't say
a job. I said that particular job.

608
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:08,624
You have it all worked out,
haven't you?

609
00:54:08,692 --> 00:54:12,992
It wasn't hard to work out, Letty. Finding
your gloves tied the whole thing together.

610
00:54:13,063 --> 00:54:15,429
Very clever.
Wait a minute.

611
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,591
Was that bullet in Ted's leg
part of your deal with Armin?

612
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:23,333
I had nothing to do with that. You
mean you didn't actually fire the shot.

613
00:54:23,407 --> 00:54:26,342
IfTed knew
you were behind the shooting,

614
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:29,004
I reckon it would hurt him more
than the bullet did.

615
00:54:30,447 --> 00:54:32,210
What- What do you
mean by that?

616
00:54:32,282 --> 00:54:34,307
He's in love with you, Letty.

617
00:55:27,604 --> 00:55:30,038
Cole Armin,
I arrest you for arson.

618
00:55:30,107 --> 00:55:33,201
Arrest me?
Wait a minute. What is this?

619
00:55:33,276 --> 00:55:35,767
Who made that complaint?
John Armin.

620
00:55:35,846 --> 00:55:37,780
You had it all ready,
didn't you?

621
00:55:37,848 --> 00:55:40,373
The whole town heard you
threatening to burn him out.

622
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:42,748
Come on.

623
00:55:54,064 --> 00:55:57,227
Morning, Fred.
Sit down, Dave.

624
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,495
<i>Hello, Mr. Cole!</i>

625
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:04,400
Stand up, Cole Armin.

626
00:56:07,411 --> 00:56:13,179
Now, Cole, you've testified that you
were not in the vicinity of the fire,

627
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:16,151
yet you refuse to tell us
where you were.

628
00:56:17,254 --> 00:56:19,916
<i>Now,you realize, of course,
if you have an alibi...</i>

629
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:22,823
<i>supported by a reputable citizen...</i>

630
00:56:22,893 --> 00:56:25,361
<i>it'll have a distinct bearing
on your case.</i>

631
00:56:25,429 --> 00:56:27,659
I have have nothing to add
to my testimony, Your Honor.

632
00:56:29,266 --> 00:56:32,030
Tell him where you was, Cole!
Go ahead! Tell him!

633
00:56:32,102 --> 00:56:34,036
You keep quiet,Juke!

634
00:56:34,104 --> 00:56:36,937
One more remark outta you,
and I'll hold you in contempt of court.

635
00:56:37,007 --> 00:56:41,341
But he's being stubborner
than a jug-headed mule.

636
00:56:45,882 --> 00:56:48,077
Sit down,Juke.

637
00:56:51,288 --> 00:56:53,620
Tell him, Daddy.
Go ahead and tell him!

638
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:56,056
Uh, wait a minute, Fred.

639
00:56:56,126 --> 00:56:58,458
Myrtle here told me something
I think you oughta know.

640
00:56:58,528 --> 00:57:02,965
Well, if it concerns this case,
why, bring her on up here, Dave.

641
00:57:03,033 --> 00:57:05,900
Come on, honey.

642
00:57:09,573 --> 00:57:12,337
<i>Order. Order.</i>

643
00:57:13,643 --> 00:57:16,168
Go ahead, Myrtle.
Tell him just what you told me.

644
00:57:16,246 --> 00:57:18,214
Now, go ahead and talk,
honey.

645
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:22,012
Well, Mr. Your Honor,

646
00:57:22,085 --> 00:57:25,020
when my daddy
ran to the fire last night,

647
00:57:25,088 --> 00:57:29,525
I was scared to be alone, so I went
to the window to look at the fire...

648
00:57:29,593 --> 00:57:32,994
and saw Mr. Cole running out
of the house across the street.

649
00:57:33,063 --> 00:57:36,430
And, uh
- Now, Myrtle, do you know who lives across the street?

650
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,833
Her-
I mean, Miss Letty.

651
00:57:45,876 --> 00:57:49,039
<i>Are you sure that
that was the man you saw?</i>

652
00:57:49,112 --> 00:57:51,205
I'm pretty sure.

653
00:57:51,281 --> 00:57:53,909
It was dark,
but he was tall like him.

654
00:57:53,984 --> 00:57:55,918
Yes, I'm pretty sure.

655
00:57:56,987 --> 00:57:59,717
Well, that's, uh,
a little irregular.

656
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:02,122
Now, honey,
you have to be positive.

657
00:58:02,192 --> 00:58:05,992
Your Honor,
the defendant is my nephew.

658
00:58:06,062 --> 00:58:11,329
And think we all feel he should be
given every chance to clear himself.

659
00:58:11,401 --> 00:58:13,528
Very possible
I have been mistaken.

660
00:58:14,604 --> 00:58:17,505
<i>If such is the case,
now is the time to correct it.</i>

661
00:58:17,574 --> 00:58:20,839
Why not call Miss Tyler
to the stand?

662
00:58:20,911 --> 00:58:25,678
If she substantiates this testimony,
I'll gladly withdraw my complaint.

663
00:58:27,584 --> 00:58:29,609
Miss Tyler,
will you take the stand?

664
00:58:33,256 --> 00:58:35,850
I can say if from here,Judge.

665
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:40,886
Cole Armin... was in my house
with me last night.

666
00:58:55,745 --> 00:58:58,407
<i>Case dismissed.</i>

667
00:58:58,481 --> 00:59:01,143
<i>John Armin,</i>

668
00:59:01,218 --> 00:59:05,814
you've used my courtroom
to air a private family squabble-

669
00:59:05,889 --> 00:59:08,858
for what reason,
I don't know and I don't care.

670
00:59:08,925 --> 00:59:11,860
<i>But I'm going to see
that it doesn't happen again.</i>

671
00:59:12,929 --> 00:59:17,662
Cole Armin, from today's testimony
of your wild threats,

672
00:59:17,734 --> 00:59:21,226
<i>I'm compelled to curb
your evident appetite for trouble.</i>

673
00:59:21,304 --> 00:59:24,171
Now, to protect you gentlemen
from each other,

674
00:59:24,241 --> 00:59:28,337
I hereby order a peace bond
executed over each of you...

675
00:59:28,411 --> 00:59:30,675
in the amount of $5,000.

676
00:59:30,747 --> 00:59:33,910
Sheriff, carry out that order.

677
00:59:33,984 --> 00:59:36,578
<i>Court adjourned!</i>

678
00:59:54,337 --> 00:59:59,206
Celia. I- I reckon
I owe you an explanation.

679
00:59:59,276 --> 01:00:02,939
I'm not interested in details, Cole.
You owe me nothing.

680
01:00:07,117 --> 01:00:11,213
All right, Armin. You're in my custody
until the bail bond's furnished.

681
01:00:13,123 --> 01:00:15,557
It was right neighborly of you
to come see me, honey,

682
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:17,718
but, uh, you better
run along home now.

683
01:00:17,794 --> 01:00:19,887
Ajail's no place for a lady.

684
01:00:19,963 --> 01:00:23,626
It is too, if that lady's best friend
is locked up inside.

685
01:00:25,135 --> 01:00:27,069
But I gotta stay here
until they let me out.

686
01:00:27,137 --> 01:00:28,968
Oh, no, you don't.

687
01:00:45,822 --> 01:00:49,758
Here you are.
I got Clara all saddled and waiting.

688
01:00:49,826 --> 01:00:53,455
She's watered and fed and can
travel four days without sleep.

689
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:56,988
Now, get to work. I'll
keep watch while you saw.

690
01:00:57,067 --> 01:01:00,468
But that would be against the law
and we've gotta respect the law.

691
01:01:00,537 --> 01:01:03,904
All right. I'm gonna stand here
until they let you out...

692
01:01:03,974 --> 01:01:07,205
if I have to stand
till I'm a little old lady in a shawl.

693
01:01:07,277 --> 01:01:09,802
I'll be a-sittin' here
a- knittin' and a-waitin'.

694
01:01:22,225 --> 01:01:24,159
Hello, Mr. Juke.
Hello.

695
01:01:26,229 --> 01:01:28,891
Oh, there you are.
You come down here, young lady.

696
01:01:28,965 --> 01:01:32,162
I want to have a talk with you. Don't
you know your pappy's lookin' for you?

697
01:01:32,235 --> 01:01:34,169
You better skedaddle home.

698
01:01:34,237 --> 01:01:36,797
No, sir.
Not until Mr. Cole gets out.

699
01:01:36,873 --> 01:01:39,899
Well, he's getting out.
I got the papers from the judge.

700
01:01:39,976 --> 01:01:42,069
The sheriff's going in
to turn him loose.

701
01:01:42,145 --> 01:01:46,582
You'd better go in and keep an eye on him,
Mr. Juke. I don't trust that old sheriff.

702
01:01:46,649 --> 01:01:50,380
Aw, don't you worry none about
him, honey. I'll take care of him.

703
01:01:50,453 --> 01:01:52,421
Run along now,
Heh heh heh.

704
01:01:52,489 --> 01:01:54,855
Good-bye, Mr. Cole!

705
01:01:54,924 --> 01:01:58,223
Come on, Clara. Reckon Mr. Cole
won't be needin' us now.

706
01:02:04,934 --> 01:02:07,528
Come on.
Juke just bailed you out.

707
01:02:07,604 --> 01:02:10,095
I'm warning you, better keep a
checkrein on that temper of yours.

708
01:02:10,173 --> 01:02:12,698
Never mind the blabber. Give him
his gun and we'll get out of here.

709
01:02:12,776 --> 01:02:16,712
Where'd that bond money come from?
It was sort of a community affair.

710
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:20,876
Huh? Ted, Celia, Dave, Pearl
- we all had a hand in it.

711
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:23,714
We? Yeah. Borrowed
some money on my mules.

712
01:02:24,788 --> 01:02:28,724
Not Damon and Pythias? Well, we had
to get you out of jail, didn't we?

713
01:02:28,792 --> 01:02:30,726
Well, I sure wanna
thank all of you.

714
01:02:30,794 --> 01:02:33,228
Good way to prove that
is to get outta town.

715
01:02:33,296 --> 01:02:35,764
Otherwise your friends
will lose $5,000.

716
01:02:35,832 --> 01:02:37,766
'Course, it isn't your money.

717
01:02:37,834 --> 01:02:39,893
Never mind.
Come on.

718
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:51,176
Well, I guess we won
the first round, Cole.

719
01:02:51,247 --> 01:02:53,579
You know,Juke,
it don't take a smart man...

720
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:56,084
to figure that my uncle's
getting a bear trap ready for me.

721
01:02:56,152 --> 01:02:58,245
All you gotta do
is stay awake, son.

722
01:02:59,355 --> 01:03:04,349
A man's only got so many fights to win, so many
dreams to dream, so much loving and hating to do,

723
01:03:04,427 --> 01:03:06,361
and usually old age
catches up with him...

724
01:03:06,429 --> 01:03:08,363
before he can correct
any mistakes he's made.

725
01:03:08,431 --> 01:03:12,868
What are you gettin' that? My biggest
mistake, old-timer, was ever leaving Texas.

726
01:03:12,936 --> 01:03:15,598
Aw, you can't say that, Cole, now.

727
01:03:18,208 --> 01:03:20,199
Eating time for the patient.

728
01:03:21,277 --> 01:03:25,213
Is that all I get? Food and medicine
are measured out in doses for invalids.

729
01:03:25,281 --> 01:03:27,215
Yes, but I wasn't
shot in the stomach.

730
01:03:27,283 --> 01:03:31,242
If you'd taken one step farther down,
you would have been. You were lucky.

731
01:03:32,322 --> 01:03:36,554
You know, bullets aren't the only
thing that can tear you apart.

732
01:03:36,626 --> 01:03:38,787
Disappointment in people
can smash you too.

733
01:03:40,196 --> 01:03:42,323
You're in love with Letty,
aren't you?

734
01:03:42,398 --> 01:03:46,732
I was. I guess we both
picked the wrong person.

735
01:03:46,803 --> 01:03:49,533
<i>We have realities to face, Ted.</i>

736
01:03:49,606 --> 01:03:52,404
Good news, folks.
Well, I finally got all the drivers.

737
01:03:52,475 --> 01:03:55,967
I had to pay 'em double when they heared
it was Angel's Roost, but I got 'em.

738
01:03:56,045 --> 01:03:57,979
We start the big climb
at sunrise.

739
01:03:58,047 --> 01:03:59,981
What about Cole?
Did you get him out of jail?

740
01:04:00,049 --> 01:04:03,780
He's out, all right.
Out of town, probably.

741
01:04:04,854 --> 01:04:06,788
<i>Out of town?
Yeah.</i>

742
01:04:06,856 --> 01:04:09,620
He said it'd be better for all hands
if he lit out.

743
01:04:09,692 --> 01:04:11,626
<i>Made a lot of mistakes here,
he said.</i>

744
01:04:11,694 --> 01:04:14,185
Goin' back to Texas,
I reckon.

745
01:04:25,275 --> 01:04:27,607
Somethin's gotta be done about this.

746
01:04:40,456 --> 01:04:41,650
Oh, Myrtle.

747
01:04:46,396 --> 01:04:48,728
<i>Myrtle.</i>

748
01:04:56,339 --> 01:05:00,002
So the big Texas hero
is crawlin' outta town.

749
01:05:01,578 --> 01:05:03,944
I don't aim to fall into
any ofJohn Armin's traps.

750
01:05:04,013 --> 01:05:07,847
I reckon Celia Wallace
would like to see you turnin' tail.

751
01:05:07,917 --> 01:05:11,375
But don't you worry. I'll be
callin' on her after you're gone.

752
01:05:19,262 --> 01:05:21,253
<i>Get up and fight.</i>

753
01:07:28,925 --> 01:07:34,192
Oh, man. If that's the way they fight
in Texas, I'm staying in Albuquerque.

754
01:07:36,265 --> 01:07:38,199
<i>As I was saying, Miss Tyler,</i>

755
01:07:38,267 --> 01:07:40,861
<i>you were brought here
for a special purpose...</i>

756
01:07:40,937 --> 01:07:42,871
<i>and you failed completely.</i>

757
01:07:42,939 --> 01:07:45,533
<i>I don't think there's anything more
to say to you...</i>

758
01:07:45,608 --> 01:07:48,873
except that here's your ticket
on the next stage.

759
01:07:48,945 --> 01:07:50,879
The sheriff will see you
to the depot.

760
01:07:52,215 --> 01:07:56,049
<i>I can find the way. I want to make
sure that you get there safely.</i>

761
01:07:56,119 --> 01:07:57,711
I don't need any protection.

762
01:07:57,787 --> 01:08:02,190
You'll need a lot of it if you're
in this town after that stage leaves.

763
01:08:02,258 --> 01:08:06,524
Come on, sister. I'll bet this isn't the
first time you were escorted out of town.

764
01:08:06,596 --> 01:08:08,530
Take you hands off me!

765
01:08:11,401 --> 01:08:14,837
He busted his peace bond. From the
looks of you, that isn't all he busted.

766
01:08:14,904 --> 01:08:17,737
Hold the jokes, Linton.
Go on, Murkil.

767
01:08:17,807 --> 01:08:20,742
Well, you-you told me
to pick a fight with him. I did.

768
01:08:21,811 --> 01:08:24,075
All right, Sheriff.
It's your move.

769
01:08:24,147 --> 01:08:28,311
I'll seeJudge Martin and get a
warrant for him for attempted murder.

770
01:08:28,384 --> 01:08:31,717
<i>That'll hold him in jail without bail
just as long as I wanna keep him there.</i>

771
01:08:31,788 --> 01:08:33,847
Until you get tired of feeding him,

772
01:08:33,923 --> 01:08:37,552
then leave the jail door open and
shoot him off his horse getting away.

773
01:08:37,627 --> 01:08:40,289
I changed my mind, gentlemen.
I'm not leaving Albuquerque.

774
01:08:40,363 --> 01:08:43,560
I'd advise you
to change your mind back again.

775
01:08:43,633 --> 01:08:46,193
No, you're going to change yours.

776
01:08:46,269 --> 01:08:49,067
If you arrest Cole Armin
and declare his peace bond forfeited,

777
01:08:49,138 --> 01:08:51,333
I'll let out a yell
that'll be heard in Washington.

778
01:08:51,407 --> 01:08:54,342
And I have plenty to yell about,
including my own part in it.

779
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:57,846
You're fixin' for a spell
in jail, aren't you, lady?

780
01:08:57,914 --> 01:08:59,848
I'll have company.

781
01:09:02,385 --> 01:09:04,546
<i>Murkil!</i>

782
01:09:12,495 --> 01:09:14,429
You ain't gonna let her
get away with that, are you?

783
01:09:14,497 --> 01:09:17,022
<i>Yeah. You're the boss.
What are you gonna do?</i>

784
01:09:17,099 --> 01:09:20,432
Life in jail...
if we can't stop her.

785
01:09:21,971 --> 01:09:24,064
You got more than her to stop.

786
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:26,836
That Wallace outfit's gonna try
the Angel's Roost run tomorrow...

787
01:09:26,909 --> 01:09:29,309
and they got the toughest hombres
in New Mexico driving.

788
01:09:29,378 --> 01:09:31,312
They ain't gonna stop at nothin'.

789
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:33,678
So they're gonna
try for the high one, huh?

790
01:09:33,749 --> 01:09:37,617
<i>It's suicide. He might
make it. He's an Armin.</i>

791
01:09:37,687 --> 01:09:41,453
Yes. He might.

792
01:09:41,524 --> 01:09:43,458
Get word to Matt Wayne.

793
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:10,546
But there ain't no sense
in you leaving, Cole.

794
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:13,885
The Wallaces need you,
and they're mighty fine folks.

795
01:10:13,956 --> 01:10:15,890
That's why I'm leaving.

796
01:10:15,958 --> 01:10:17,892
Yes, but you don't have to.

797
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:21,396
I'll have more witnesses than you can
get into Fred Martin's courtroom...

798
01:10:21,464 --> 01:10:23,398
that you was nettled
into that fight.

799
01:10:23,466 --> 01:10:25,559
Now, wait a minute, Dave.
It isn't that fight.

800
01:10:25,635 --> 01:10:27,865
I'd still be under bond,
and next time...

801
01:10:27,937 --> 01:10:29,871
I'd kill Murkil
and maybe Armin.

802
01:10:29,939 --> 01:10:33,238
<i>Hey, mister! We're shoving off
for El Paso. You coming with us?</i>

803
01:10:36,646 --> 01:10:38,807
Good-bye, old-timer.

804
01:10:41,484 --> 01:10:45,147
Good-bye, Mr. Cole. I feel awful.

805
01:10:46,355 --> 01:10:48,846
<i>Cole! Cole Armin!
So long, Dave.</i>

806
01:10:48,925 --> 01:10:51,860
Cole! Wait up there! Wait!

807
01:10:51,928 --> 01:10:54,021
Hold that coach, driver! Cole!

808
01:10:56,666 --> 01:10:59,226
Cole, I mean, you ain't going
no place. What's all this?

809
01:10:59,302 --> 01:11:02,362
Ask Letty.
Don't ask me how or why,

810
01:11:02,438 --> 01:11:05,737
but there'll be no further actions
by the sheriff on that peace bond.

811
01:11:05,808 --> 01:11:07,742
What's that?
You heared her.

812
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:10,711
Look, fella. I'm pulling out.
You leaving?

813
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:13,146
No, he ain't! Git a gettin'.
Come on, son.

814
01:11:13,215 --> 01:11:15,445
<i>Hyah! Hep! Hep!</i>

815
01:11:21,123 --> 01:11:23,887
<i>Hey! Giddyap!
Good luck, Cole.</i>

816
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:27,293
I'm bettin' on you.
I hope you win, Dave.

817
01:11:27,363 --> 01:11:31,231
I gotta. I'm gonna send Myrtle
to college with those winnings.

818
01:12:17,613 --> 01:12:19,604
All right, folks,
here's some easy money!

819
01:12:19,682 --> 01:12:23,209
Murkil's laying 10-to-1 that
Wallace's outfit don't make the run!

820
01:12:23,285 --> 01:12:25,549
<i>I'll bet $ 10 they do
make it! It's a bet.</i>

821
01:12:25,621 --> 01:12:28,715
Here you are.
I'll take 100 of that.

822
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:32,283
All right. I'll bet you 2-to-1
they don't even get up there.

823
01:12:32,361 --> 01:12:34,295
I'll take that too.

824
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:40,897
All right. Alice.
Put me in for 20.

825
01:12:50,813 --> 01:12:53,577
<i>I'll bet you 20 they don't
get down. 10-to-1 they don't.</i>

826
01:13:01,323 --> 01:13:03,917
<i>I'd give a $ 1,000
to be on that lead wagon.</i>

827
01:13:08,731 --> 01:13:10,858
Juke will bring 'em through.

828
01:13:10,933 --> 01:13:13,197
Why didn't you go down to
the gate and wish 'em luck?

829
01:13:13,269 --> 01:13:15,703
Somehow it didn't mean as much
as I thought it would.

830
01:13:15,771 --> 01:13:19,468
Well, after all, you know, Cole
wouldn't have been much help.

831
01:13:19,542 --> 01:13:23,239
He can't drive. It was his being
here that made the difference.

832
01:13:23,312 --> 01:13:26,372
I'd feel better
if he was with them.

833
01:13:26,449 --> 01:13:28,417
<i>Yes. I know, Sis.</i>

834
01:13:30,119 --> 01:13:34,647
Strange, isn't it, how one person can
become so important in your life...

835
01:13:34,724 --> 01:13:37,420
that without them
nothing seems to matter.

836
01:13:37,493 --> 01:13:39,518
<i>It is strange.</i>

837
01:13:41,497 --> 01:13:43,431
We oughta be ashamed.

838
01:13:43,499 --> 01:13:47,401
Thinking of ourselves when men and
animals are risking their lives for us.

839
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:51,236
It's gonna take a lot of courage
and luck to bring those wagons down.

840
01:13:51,307 --> 01:13:54,242
All we can do is wait
and hope for the best.

841
01:14:03,919 --> 01:14:06,581
Maybe a little prayer
from this end will help them...

842
01:14:06,655 --> 01:14:08,646
and us.

843
01:14:28,944 --> 01:14:31,708
Stop running! Hup!

844
01:14:45,294 --> 01:14:47,228
When is the next stage for Santa Fe?

845
01:14:47,296 --> 01:14:51,062
If it's on time, it's due here
in two hours and 15 minutes.

846
01:15:09,451 --> 01:15:12,648
Well, that means more trouble.
Trouble?

847
01:15:12,721 --> 01:15:16,680
It's Matt Wayne and his men. It's no secret
here in town that they'reJohn Armin's gunmen.

848
01:15:36,111 --> 01:15:38,773
Hold 'em here, Andy.
I'll see what the old man wants.

849
01:15:54,964 --> 01:15:57,558
What do you want here?
I wanna see Ted.

850
01:15:57,633 --> 01:15:59,897
Matt Wayne and his men
just rode up to Armin's place.

851
01:15:59,969 --> 01:16:03,336
Right now they're probably getting instructions
to smash your outfit and Cole Armin too.

852
01:16:03,405 --> 01:16:07,432
Cole Armin's on his way to Texas. He
started for Texas, butJuke and I stopped him.

853
01:16:07,509 --> 01:16:10,672
He's up there now helping to bring
your wagons down from the Angel's Roost.

854
01:16:10,746 --> 01:16:14,341
- Do you expect us to believe that?
- You will when you hear the rest.

855
01:16:14,416 --> 01:16:19,683
You were wrong about Cole, Celia. He guessed that
I was working for his uncle, and he was right.

856
01:16:19,755 --> 01:16:23,714
John Armin brought you to Albuquerque
to get information about our plans?

857
01:16:23,792 --> 01:16:28,855
<i>Yes. Cole suspected me and that's why he
came to my house the night of the fire.</i>

858
01:16:28,931 --> 01:16:32,059
Oh, you don't know
what it means to hear that, Letty.

859
01:16:32,134 --> 01:16:34,068
Where are you going, Sis?

860
01:16:34,136 --> 01:16:37,799
It's time somebody in this family
starting thinking about Cole.

861
01:16:39,608 --> 01:16:43,374
You must've had a pretty good reason
for changing over to our side, Letty.

862
01:16:43,445 --> 01:16:46,209
I did.

863
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:49,974
I'll tell you when I have more time.

864
01:16:52,554 --> 01:16:55,114
Now, boys,
we're in for a tough job.

865
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:58,091
Y'all know what's ahead of you.
Remember what I told you.

866
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:01,425
If the shale starts slippin'
or you get in any trouble,

867
01:17:01,497 --> 01:17:04,989
cut the animals loose and jump-
let the wagons go over.

868
01:17:05,067 --> 01:17:07,331
You understand?
Sure,Juke. We understand.

869
01:17:07,403 --> 01:17:10,566
All right. Get up on your wagons.
I'll give the order to start.

870
01:17:10,639 --> 01:17:13,005
All right, boys.
Come on. Let's get going.

871
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:16,776
I wanna wish both you boys
a lot of luck. We'll need it.

872
01:17:16,845 --> 01:17:20,042
<i>Here we go, Cole.
Albuquerque or bust.</i>

873
01:17:20,115 --> 01:17:22,174
Good luck,Juke. I hope
you make it. Make it?

874
01:17:22,251 --> 01:17:25,743
Shucks, I can make that ride
standing on my head.

875
01:17:25,821 --> 01:17:28,517
Juke, one of your riders has run out.
Huh? Which one?

876
01:17:28,590 --> 01:17:32,117
Jim Rough. Tearin' out for town on a
horse. Must've had one here waitin' for him.

877
01:17:32,194 --> 01:17:36,187
Doggone it. I was scared of that feller,
but he's all there was left.

878
01:17:36,265 --> 01:17:38,426
Armin hired every driver in town.

879
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,764
Armin probably hired him too.

880
01:17:40,836 --> 01:17:42,770
Too bad.
I guess that hangs you up.

881
01:17:42,838 --> 01:17:45,363
The agreement with Huggins
was 10 wagons or no deal.

882
01:17:46,942 --> 01:17:48,933
Tell Huggins
it'll be 10 wagons.

883
01:17:51,013 --> 01:17:53,379
H- Hey! Wait a minute, Cole.
Wait a minute!

884
01:17:53,449 --> 01:17:55,713
Who's gonna drive Rough's
wagon? I'm gonna try it.

885
01:17:55,784 --> 01:18:01,222
Listen, this ain't no Wells Fargo four-up
stagecoach on a flat Texas prairie. This is-

886
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:04,316
This is a 12-mule hitch on a bad
mountain road. I know, I know.

887
01:18:04,393 --> 01:18:08,659
I'm scared to let you try it. Listen, to tell
you the truth, I'm twice as scared as you are.

888
01:18:08,731 --> 01:18:11,291
But standing here arguing isn't
getting that ore down to the mill.

889
01:18:11,367 --> 01:18:13,392
Get on your wagon,Juke.

890
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,092
Now, mark this, Wayne.

891
01:18:40,162 --> 01:18:42,687
If they every get down from that run,
it means-

892
01:18:42,765 --> 01:18:44,858
Is there any chance
they won't make it?

893
01:18:44,933 --> 01:18:47,527
There's a good chance
they won't make it.

894
01:18:47,603 --> 01:18:49,696
What do you want
with him and his men?

895
01:18:49,772 --> 01:18:53,868
To play safe on the off chance
that they might make it.

896
01:18:53,942 --> 01:18:58,038
I want this Wallace outfit destroyed,
wiped out permanently...

897
01:18:58,113 --> 01:19:01,048
to show Albuquerque
that I'm still running it.

898
01:19:01,116 --> 01:19:03,812
You know what to do!
Now, get out, both of you!

899
01:19:15,564 --> 01:19:18,362
<i>¶¶</i>

900
01:19:18,434 --> 01:19:20,834
Hup, Damon.
Hey thar, Pythias.

901
01:19:20,903 --> 01:19:22,894
Whoa. Hey.

902
01:19:37,986 --> 01:19:39,977
Hey!

903
01:20:16,258 --> 01:20:18,317
Ho!

904
01:20:24,967 --> 01:20:29,495
Hey! Hold 'em back there, Cole!
Hold 'em back, Cole!

905
01:20:29,571 --> 01:20:31,664
Hey,Juke!

906
01:20:34,443 --> 01:20:37,310
Hyah! Damon, come on!
Hup! Damon, Pythias!

907
01:20:40,716 --> 01:20:42,775
Come on, boys!

908
01:20:46,255 --> 01:20:49,156
Stop 'em, Cole! Stop 'em!

909
01:20:49,224 --> 01:20:52,682
I can't! Keep going,Juke!

910
01:20:52,761 --> 01:20:57,164
Hyah, boys! Hyah!

911
01:21:01,270 --> 01:21:02,828
Ho!

912
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,305
Hold 'em! Hold 'em, Cole!

913
01:21:17,553 --> 01:21:19,919
Hyah, boys!

914
01:21:31,333 --> 01:21:33,893
Stop 'em, Cole!

915
01:21:47,115 --> 01:21:48,912
Ho!

916
01:22:05,067 --> 01:22:06,398
Ho!

917
01:22:12,674 --> 01:22:14,574
Ho!

918
01:22:32,294 --> 01:22:34,888
<i>Doggone it, Cole!
I told you ya couldn't drive.</i>

919
01:22:34,963 --> 01:22:36,897
What's the matter?
The brake snapped on me.

920
01:22:36,965 --> 01:22:40,059
You mean you come down through
all that shale with no brake? Yeah.

921
01:22:40,135 --> 01:22:42,399
Why, the man ain't living
that can do it.

922
01:22:42,471 --> 01:22:44,405
I'm not sure I am living.

923
01:22:44,473 --> 01:22:47,567
Mm. I thought we was both goners,
us and the mules,

924
01:22:47,643 --> 01:22:49,907
when you come
barreling down on us there.

925
01:22:49,978 --> 01:22:52,242
Take a look at that.

926
01:22:52,314 --> 01:22:55,408
Why, that weren't broke. It was
sawed! That's what I'm talking about.

927
01:22:55,484 --> 01:22:57,918
Come on. We got some business
in Albuquerque. No, you don't.

928
01:22:57,986 --> 01:23:01,353
You get up on that lead wagon.
I'm gonna keep my eye on you.

929
01:23:01,423 --> 01:23:04,517
Now you makin' me feel
a lot better. Thanks, pappy.

930
01:23:04,593 --> 01:23:08,085
Yeah. Pappy? Hmm.

931
01:23:09,765 --> 01:23:11,733
What's going on, Harvey?
Everybody's leaving town.

932
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:14,701
Well, can you blame 'em?
Matt Wayne and his men are back.

933
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:17,204
Better get your kids
and head for home.

934
01:23:17,272 --> 01:23:19,797
Maybe you're right.

935
01:23:25,781 --> 01:23:28,443
Remember,
no shootin' till the sheriff fires.

936
01:24:03,151 --> 01:24:05,847
What is it, Celia? You look
scared. I am, Cole. Terribly.

937
01:24:05,921 --> 01:24:08,014
Is it Ted? Anything happen to him. No.

938
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:10,024
<i>What's a matter now?
Why'd we stop?</i>

939
01:24:10,092 --> 01:24:12,890
The town's alive with Matt Wayne
and his men. They're waiting for you.

940
01:24:12,961 --> 01:24:15,225
It's wholesale murder, Cole,
if you take a step farther.

941
01:24:15,297 --> 01:24:17,561
We're obliged to you
for the warning, Celia,

942
01:24:17,632 --> 01:24:20,294
but I reckon we can handle any
trouble that comes along, eh,Juke?

943
01:24:20,369 --> 01:24:25,204
"The words of his mouth were smoother
than butter, but war was in his heart. "

944
01:24:25,273 --> 01:24:26,865
That's from the good book.

945
01:24:26,942 --> 01:24:31,436
Now, if you folks will excuse me, I'll
have the men gird their loins for battle.

946
01:24:34,282 --> 01:24:36,773
I didn't figure you aimed
to put yourself out for me anymore.

947
01:24:36,852 --> 01:24:40,219
Well, thanks to Letty
I'm seeing things clearly again.

948
01:24:40,288 --> 01:24:42,222
Uh-huh.
Listen, Cole,

949
01:24:42,290 --> 01:24:44,383
bringing the ore in
isn't important now.

950
01:24:44,459 --> 01:24:47,485
Your life is... to me.

951
01:24:47,562 --> 01:24:49,553
Thanks, Celia.

952
01:24:51,633 --> 01:24:53,760
You run along home now
by the side roads.

953
01:24:53,835 --> 01:24:55,826
And if by chance you should
see Preacher Murray,

954
01:24:55,904 --> 01:24:58,429
tell him he's gonna have
a couple of customers.

955
01:24:58,507 --> 01:25:01,237
I will. Giddyap.
Take care of yourself, Cole! Giddyap!

956
01:25:01,309 --> 01:25:03,334
<i>I got a good reason to now!</i>

957
01:26:03,071 --> 01:26:05,335
Looks like the Armin Empire
is going to war.

958
01:26:07,742 --> 01:26:09,676
You're right, Miss Tyler.

959
01:26:09,744 --> 01:26:12,406
Now you'll see what happens
to people who oppose me.

960
01:26:13,915 --> 01:26:17,248
The first sound of fire out there,
you'll get a bullet in your back.

961
01:26:18,253 --> 01:26:20,983
A gun with blank cartridges
doesn't frighten me.

962
01:26:21,056 --> 01:26:23,047
<i>Blank cartridges?</i>

963
01:26:25,861 --> 01:26:28,193
Are you gonna get your men
off that street?

964
01:26:28,263 --> 01:26:31,061
I'm not changing my orders.

965
01:28:58,780 --> 01:29:01,874
They get you, old-timer?
Aw,just nicked me.

966
01:29:06,121 --> 01:29:10,217
Hey. Walton got here with the
cavalry just in time, didn't he?

967
01:29:16,064 --> 01:29:18,259
Mr. Armin! Mr. Armin!

968
01:29:43,258 --> 01:29:45,522
Wait a minute, Pearl.
What now?

969
01:29:45,593 --> 01:29:48,357
If I'm gonna make
the supreme sacrifice,

970
01:29:48,430 --> 01:29:52,196
I'll be dagblasted
if I want the whole town watchin'.

971
01:29:52,267 --> 01:29:54,292
Pull down that curtain.
