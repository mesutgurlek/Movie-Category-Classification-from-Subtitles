1
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,994
Thanks, Ma.

2
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,759
Who are they, Pa?

3
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,428
Get inside, John.

4
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,598
He's hurt. Let us in.

5
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,592
- I'll tendto him.
- I'll tell the sheriff.

6
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,638
The Cheaters' Gang is over with.
This time you lose.

7
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,440
- Cheaters never lose. Never!
- Get out.

8
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,955
Kill them!
It'll make for a nice memory!

9
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,312
- Get your Colt.
- Never! Don't do it!

10
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,957
Go, Molly!

11
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,589
You were lucky, John Luke.

12
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,798
You dodged the Cheaters' Gang.

13
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,353
And no one ever dodges a Cheater.

14
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,114
Believe me, you're...
very lucky, John Luke!

15
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,354
You beat death!

16
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,350
You're lucky! You're...

17
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,070
You're... Lucky Luke!

18
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,639
Got it already.

19
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,913
Got it already.

20
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,792
''American Hero''...

21
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,554
Got it already.

22
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,988
Lucky Luke!

23
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,912
Captain Mac Straggle, 20th Cavalry.

24
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,278
Colonel Mac Straggle has a message
from the President of the USA.

25
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,393
Thank the President
for checking in on me...

26
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,795
but I'm on vacation.

27
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,393
He says he's on vaca...

28
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,559
There's no vacation
for heroes of the West.

29
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,079
Kid, I know your father well.

30
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,276
He knows I stick to my guns.

31
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,834
He says I stick...

32
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,798
I'm going to tease pike
out of the Klondike.

33
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,794
Tell the President
I have an extra rod.

34
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,634
You can tell him yourself,
boy scout!

35
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,389
We lead in 2 states
and are neck and neck in the others.

36
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,073
I won't lose the election!

37
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,914
This transcontinental railroad
is the answer.

38
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,319
With the coasts linked,

39
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,155
America will exist.

40
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,278
Shortly, sir.
The New York-San Francisco line

41
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,272
will connect in Golden City
in 3 months.

42
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,949
That's too long.

43
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,432
We have to finish
before the elections next month.

44
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,154
The tracks will join...
in Daisy Town.

45
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,873
- Daisy Town?
-That's crazy!

46
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,390
-Too dangerous.
- We should burn it down!

47
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,874
Destroy Daisy Town!

48
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,679
Whoever harms my pretty Daisy
answers to me.

49
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,548
Don't get him wrong.

50
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,592
The Daisy Town
which Luke remembers

51
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,353
was heaven on Earth.

52
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,431
Mr. Maurice Austin Cooper,

53
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,829
Governor of Utah!

54
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,628
President...

55
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,790
gentlemen...

56
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,880
Pardon my being sentimental, but...

57
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,559
I'm recalling how

58
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,399
on July 2, 1831 ,

59
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,914
I came from Ireland

60
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,311
on the same boat as his father.

61
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,236
The Lukes tilled
the red soil of Daisy Town,

62
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,233
where our cattle grazed in peace.

63
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,953
But nowadays...

64
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,112
the area is infested

65
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,998
with desperados and Indians.

66
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,710
You know me, Winston.

67
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,429
If I were you...

68
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,233
But you're not. Not yet.

69
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,629
Let me finish this term

70
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,273
and maybe even another.

71
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,276
Here, Cooper.

72
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,312
In 3 weeks I'll drive in this spike
to inaugurate the last section.

73
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,109
- Mr. President, don't do it!
- It's insane.

74
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,397
I want Mr. Luke to establish order
in Daisy Town.

75
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,958
Do you accept this mission?

76
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,789
Yep.

77
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,399
How long will it take
to establish order?

78
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,837
48 hours.

79
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,029
Cigarette, anyone?

80
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,196
Still not smoking?

81
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,993
I have an Apatchi.

82
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,510
Still not smoking!

83
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,358
He quit!

84
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,474
Take care, Coop.

85
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,673
You're not obliged
to go back to Daisy Town.

86
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,714
That place is full of ghosts
for you.

87
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,993
I'll speak to the President.

88
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,999
I gave him my word.

89
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,150
Think it over.

90
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,193
I'm not made for thinking.

91
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,430
It's him, Miss! Lucky Luke!

92
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,119
That's enough kids.

93
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,793
Stay here. Be good.

94
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,876
Here!

95
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,354
I love you!

96
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,798
You're too lucky, Lucky Luke!

97
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,428
Way too lucky!

98
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,314
You're lucky, John Luke.

99
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,959
Very lucky!

100
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,591
You dodged the Cheaters'Gang.

101
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,550
You're lucky. You're...

102
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,629
Lucky Luke!

103
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,797
BIRTHPLACE OF LUCKY LUKE

104
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,476
Boots, size 54.

105
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,432
Andfor the horse?

106
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,230
Rain coming.

107
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,709
Up, you maggots!
And in single file!

108
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,720
You never get sick
of filling up jails?

109
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,635
Lucky Luke,
the man who never killed anyone.

110
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,998
You never got over
seeing your parents die.

111
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,270
That cod-face of yours
got a name?

112
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,750
Pat Poker.

113
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,353
Welcome to my town.

114
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,670
Missed.

115
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,311
Alas, you're unwelcome in mine.

116
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,148
How did you do
the 5-dollar bill trick?

117
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,631
Lousy.

118
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,154
Leave my office.

119
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,915
Daisy Town bodes ill for sheriffs.

120
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,471
The soil is red with their blood.

121
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,591
Before it gets red with yours,

122
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,832
bet on black
and get lost before nightfall.

123
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,236
Expect a gift from me tomorrow.

124
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,599
You alright with death?

125
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,793
Tomorrow I clean house.

126
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,351
John!

127
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,595
It's Flimsey.

128
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:25,956
Remember?

129
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,875
Down here, John.

130
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,149
In the barrel.

131
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,275
Flimsey?

132
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,513
Flimsey the bug!

133
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,869
What the heck?

134
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,794
We're glad to see you!

135
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,149
- Get out.
- You crazy?

136
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,519
Want them to kill me?

137
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,672
Tell everyone it's over now.

138
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,552
Time to come out of hiding.

139
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,950
Poker won't let his gang go to jail.

140
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,395
He hired a bad-ass bandit
to smoke you.

141
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,993
Who's the fat vat?

142
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,195
My wife.

143
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,158
No one's getting smoked, ma'am.
Pleasedto meet you.

144
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,517
Billy the Kid City! End of the line!
Time to die!

145
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,953
Billy the Kid's in town!

146
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,519
I'm worth 5000 dollars!

147
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,188
Good lolly, Mr. Billy!

148
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,916
Not Mister.

149
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,715
Just Billy.

150
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,157
Billy the Kid. Like you.

151
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,355
So long, Lilly.

152
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,877
Don't share with your brother!

153
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,355
Thanks for the ride!

154
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,592
Bam! Got the old hag!

155
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,193
Don't move, you hear?

156
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,555
You neither!

157
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,835
Don't move!

158
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,469
The boss is waiting.

159
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,358
Drop the gun, Q-Tip.

160
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,950
Start walking and keep them up.

161
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,555
So?

162
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,599
Got my money, wizard?

163
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,192
Andthe bird's unharmed.

164
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,316
So?

165
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,073
How much did your hen
drop from its ass?

166
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,112
- 15,000.
- Billy the Kid...

167
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,995
kill Lucky Luke for 15,000 dollars?

168
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,469
You're right.

169
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,710
10,000.

170
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,912
Lucky Luke sent me to reform school
when I was 7.

171
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,471
And I'd done nothing wrong.

172
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,513
I thought you'd killed your parents.

173
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,995
Exactly.

174
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,313
I'd done nothing wrong.

175
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,553
So I came to kill Lucky Luke
for personal reasons.

176
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,070
I'll pick up my money
once he's dead.

177
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,269
You offendatedme
by implying I could be bought.

178
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,476
And get me some cherry juice!

179
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,874
Next time, I want cherry juice!

180
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,197
He's coming! Barber Street!

181
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,550
Gentlemen?

182
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,596
I assume you know the way to jail.

183
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,636
Yep...

184
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,871
Sometimes life can get prickly.

185
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,275
Fourteen...

186
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,789
Pistol Pete.

187
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,995
Go on...

188
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,430
Fifteen...

189
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,119
RattlesnakeJoe.

190
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,111
So, Hank, what's up with you?

191
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,317
Goldie.

192
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,795
Digger's daughter?

193
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,149
Pregnant with our 6th.

194
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,952
You're not lonesome, cowboy.

195
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,350
Stop by sometime!

196
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,234
Next time, bud.

197
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,313
Won't be no next time.

198
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,395
I like you, Billy.
Don't make me hurt you.

199
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,189
Pretty lousy last words...
for a guy of your stature.

200
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,313
Out of luck.

201
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,188
Farewell, Lucky Luke.

202
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,669
This is my snack.

203
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,155
It's my snack! It doesn't count.

204
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,396
Farewell, Lucky Luke.

205
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,118
That's your water gun.

206
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,110
Nope.

207
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,196
Yeah.

208
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,629
I don't get it.

209
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,036
It worked in front of the mirror!

210
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,554
Poop! What's wrong?

211
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,076
Shut your traps, retards!

212
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,553
You're out of luck. So long.

213
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,835
He killed me!

214
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,035
I'm cold.

215
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,829
I'm hot.

216
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,910
Give me a snuggle...

217
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,832
I'm a monkey's uncle!

218
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,316
His bullets hit mine!

219
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,638
Banana-chocolate.

220
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,628
I wasn't hit.

221
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,435
I wasn't hit.

222
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,914
I'm not dead!

223
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,988
It hurts. It stings.

224
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,030
It stings a little.

225
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,793
You missedthe coach.

226
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,355
In the meantime,
I'll read you a story.

227
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,754
I don't want to go!

228
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,468
Tomorrow...

229
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,712
Luke will grow his blade of grass...
six feet under.

230
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,469
It's between us now.

231
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,955
Hey, guys!

232
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,554
Barrels in the buff!

233
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,193
This saloon is for denizens
of Daisy Town.

234
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,912
So pay for your last whiskies.

235
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,598
Hear that, friends?
Time to pack up and leave.

236
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,915
No! Stay put, you idiots!

237
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,396
Bet on 1 7, Lucky Luke.

238
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,189
16 sheriffs await you
at the cemetery.

239
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,589
Chips down.

240
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,474
No more bets.

241
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,394
Seventeen.

242
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,796
Black, odd and pray to God.

243
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,077
He rode off into the smoldering sky

244
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,750
He went off and let our kisses die

245
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,719
He left me
with just two eyes to cry

246
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,554
My lonesome cowboy...

247
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,599
shot my heart

248
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,989
like a bullet from his peacemaker

249
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,950
Thanks, Sam.

250
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,430
Rode in on his horse,
used all his force

251
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,794
Took me for a ride

252
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,239
Took his Belle with pride

253
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,560
My lonesome cowboy shot my heart

254
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,997
like a bullet from his peacemaker

255
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,156
I await my lover, await my hero

256
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,996
so that he and I
can start again from zero

257
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,915
Abullet for Belle

258
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,717
or ring your death knell

259
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,071
Abullet for Belle

260
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,074
or Belle will blast a bullet

261
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,038
into your heart

262
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,391
No, Pat!

263
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,798
Losing hand, Poker.

264
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,355
That hurts.

265
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,397
It's too late to fight.

266
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,113
Like my watch?

267
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,591
Lucky Luke.

268
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,477
The man who never killed anyone.

269
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,712
Killing has its good sides.

270
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,676
There's before the kill, and after.

271
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,238
It's in your head, your skin,
your bones.

272
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,634
It leaves traces.

273
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,999
And memories.

274
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,598
What will you do now?

275
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,869
Shoot the chandelier
to knock me out?

276
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,879
Poor little hero...
who never killed anyone.

277
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,709
Outside!

278
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,595
Get lost!

279
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,394
He's dead.

280
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,277
LUKE KILLS

281
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,354
I'll never kill anyone.

282
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,674
Never!

283
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,037
You never got over
seeing your parents killed.

284
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,999
You're not obliged
to go back to Daisy Town.

285
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,479
He's dead!

286
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,439
Killing has its good sides.
Alright with death?

287
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,795
Don't do it!

288
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,950
Outside!

289
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,870
Cowboy! Aren't you overdoing it?

290
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,680
Use your head.
No trains come by here.

291
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,595
Come on, kid. Let's go home.

292
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,393
Was that you who...?

293
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,077
Go on.

294
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,792
Do it again.

295
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,951
Are you done yet?

296
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,949
You talk!

297
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,277
You talk! Damn, he talks!

298
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,314
Okay, I got it.
I can talk. No news to me.

299
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,438
Now climb on me
and let's get going. Okay?

300
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,159
My name is John Luke.

301
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,868
I'm pacing around
and my horse can talk.

302
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,517
You done? Start smoking again!

303
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,835
I'm losing it.

304
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,068
Don't sit back down!

305
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,349
We have work, Lulu!

306
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,995
Have you forgotten?

307
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,550
The train, the President,
the mission, Daisy Town...

308
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,268
Your horse and only friend,
JollyJumper.

309
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,192
That true, unsung hero...
hidden under your butt.

310
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,113
- Have you forgotten or...
- Will you shut up?

311
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,033
What's ''shut up'' in Horse?

312
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,233
In Horse?
In Horse it goes like this...

313
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,478
We don't say it often
because it's a bit long.

314
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,552
Why didn't you talk to me before?

315
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,189
You never laid on the tracks before.

316
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,679
You know, Jolly...

317
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,117
- You're my only friend.
- True.

318
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,910
I'd have been nothing without you.

319
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,388
True too.

320
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,275
Yeah...

321
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,036
You got that right.

322
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,598
Eleanor... Eleanor's in love!

323
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,513
Too cute, Johnny-Johnny.

324
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,354
I don't love you, Eleanor.
I love no one!

325
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,751
He's hurt. Let us in.

326
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,876
I'll tend to him.

327
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,190
- I'll tell the sheriff.
- Don't do that.

328
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,352
The Cheaters Gang is over with.
This time you lose.

329
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,238
Cheaters never lose.

330
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,471
Kill him.
Make for a nice memory.

331
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,996
- Get your Colt.
- Never! Don't do it!

332
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,551
I swear, Coop.
I always thought I was doing good.

333
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,837
In fact I was seeking revenge.

334
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,918
You were seeking justice.

335
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,994
The West wouldn't be the West
without you.

336
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,114
You're Lucky Luke...

337
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,234
Astar in our flag.

338
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,039
I killed a man.

339
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,550
You rid the West of a scoundrel.

340
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,598
And life goes on.

341
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,079
As Governor,
I shouldtell you to continue.

342
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,398
But if I weren't afraid
of betrayingAmerica,

343
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,237
I'd tell you this death
is the chance of your life.

344
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,236
Anew life,
without guns, without violence.

345
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,797
In any case, a train
will soon run coast to coast.

346
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,313
Cities will take over
the great outdoors.

347
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,031
It's the end of our world, John.

348
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,751
All these farmers, these families...

349
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,513
They count on me.

350
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,676
- Who'll defend them?
-They'll find someone else.

351
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,070
Trust me. Change your life
before it's too late.

352
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,553
I'm here for you.

353
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,117
You realize what you're doing?

354
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,793
No, cowboy, not your Colt!

355
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,591
You realize what you're doing?

356
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,110
Do you realize?
You can't hang it up for good!

357
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,396
Cowboy... You're Lucky Luke!

358
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,029
KILLED BY LUCKY LUKE

359
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,791
I foundthat in the dust.

360
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,639
That's why I'm here, Sam.

361
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,148
For Daisy and her kids.

362
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,199
You have 280 years to go.

363
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,070
Geezer! Give us two cherry juices.

364
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,837
Your jail is full of drafts.

365
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,754
And soon your body will be,
Lucky Luke.

366
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,277
Have a lolly. I'll be a minute.

367
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,388
Thanks, Lucky.

368
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,549
You're the best triggers
in the county.

369
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,713
This town needs a sheriff.

370
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,510
Doesn't anyone want a clean slate?

371
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,079
To stop being a loner?

372
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,193
Being on the run?

373
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,558
To be respected and loved?

374
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,870
I don't know... to start a family.

375
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,552
Haven't we all dreamt of it?

376
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,354
Where's your Colt?

377
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,709
He has no gun!

378
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,110
Kill him!

379
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,755
You sent me to jail!

380
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,113
- Our fate is for us to decide.
- My fate wasn't 15 years in jail.

381
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,708
Kill him nice and slow!

382
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,078
Go on, you retards!

383
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,348
This will keep your mouth shut!

384
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,629
Nineteen...

385
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,676
Twenty.

386
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,229
Thanks, gentlemen.

387
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:20,990
I'm Billy the Kid!

388
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,749
And I'll ridthe West of Lucky Luke!

389
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,396
Out of my way, bowling ball!

390
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,995
Beautiful.

391
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,433
If any of you hyenas touches him,
you won't see the sun set.

392
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,071
Calamity!

393
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,916
Jane...

394
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,392
Hats off for a lady!
Lily-livered, snot-nosed lowlifes!

395
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,630
1 against 100.

396
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,829
You think you really got a chance,

397
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,594
Calamity Jane?

398
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,315
Two...

399
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,033
against 100.

400
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,630
Jesse James...

401
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,951
''To be great...

402
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,431
''is not to stir...

403
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,759
''without great...

404
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,713
''argument!''

405
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,069
Hamlet.

406
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,471
Act IV, scene 4.

407
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,993
Is what I hear true?

408
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,516
You hung up your Colt, Luke?

409
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,354
Jesse...

410
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,993
''The evil...

411
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,231
''men do...

412
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,437

413
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,199
''The good, O the good...

414
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,035
''is oft interred...

415
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,197
''with their bones.''

416
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,999
Julius Caesar.

417
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,312
Act III, scene 3.

418
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,672
Luke is a legend.

419
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,876
He deserves to die in a duel.

420
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,276
And I won't let anyone

421
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,916
kill him, besides me.

422
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,912
I don't like your reason.

423
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,918
But my choices are limited.

424
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,435
You're deputy sheriff, JesseJames.

425
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,151
Where are you taking my Lucky?

426
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,951
And why a duel? Let's kill him now!

427
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,597
What matters is not
the blood spilled, but the ink.

428
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,959
In 100 years,
kids will read in history books

429
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,879
thatJesseJames,
the greatest outlaw ever,

430
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,394
killed Luke in a duel.

431
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,074
That's how it is.

432
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,118
Load of crap,
your greatest outlaw routine.

433
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,831
I'm the greatest outlaw ever!

434
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:48,197
I should kill Lucky Luke!
And I will kill Lucky Luke!

435
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,509
Give me that!

436
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,839
And in 100 years,

437
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,235
kids will read

438
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,909
that the Kid
was the greatest outlaw ever!

439
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,594
Billy the Kid,
the greatest outlaw ever,

440
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,995
killed Lucky Luke.

441
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,719
And Jesse James!

442
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,988
Catchy, isn't it?

443
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,629
Find another one.

444
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,070
I need your carriage, Doc.
Move.

445
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,396
I'll watch him.
Watch over the town.

446
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,030
You have 48 hours
to walk tall in your boots, Luke.

447
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,395
Become a legend again.

448
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,195
From hitherto forward, I'm sheriff.
Everyone in the saloon!

449
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,956
Hot cocoa for everyone.

450
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,152
And if you don't drink it,

451
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,709
straight to jail. That clear?

452
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,594
There's one left.

453
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,479
Is someone not thirsty?

454
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,390
That's better.

455
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,910
- What do we do?
- Put bad guys in jail.

456
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,749
Why?

457
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,956
To protect Lucky Luke. Get it?

458
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,595
Because he has no gun?

459
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,075
- Because I'm killing him.
- No, I am!

460
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,958
Where can we get badges?

461
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,555
- In the sheriff's office.
- So let's go there.

462
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,154
I'm a poor lonesome cowboy,

463
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,550
and a long, long way from home...

464
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,271
Let's get you comfortable.

465
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,513
Take off these pants.

466
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,158
I'll take care of that.

467
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,270
He needs the help of a real woman.

468
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,351
Let's see if I'm real or not.

469
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,435
Sweetie-pie!

470
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,873
I'll keep guard.

471
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,794
I'm dead.

472
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,238
You're the angel
of lonesome cowboys.

473
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,033
Good night, Jolly.

474
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,955
What the hell?

475
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,879
I'm sorry.
I thought you were my horse.

476
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,670
- Force of habit.
- Sorry.

477
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,359
It's called water, cowboy.

478
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,434
Feel any better?

479
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,835
Nothing to see here.

480
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:55,910
What are you doing?

481
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,429
Removing your boots.

482
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,557
What for?

483
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,591
It's better.

484
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,554
Boots never come off!

485
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,153
Relax, tenderfoot.

486
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,234
Nails like that
keep you on your toes.

487
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,473
They'll skin your hide.

488
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,678
At least it'll be clean.

489
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,273
Got any dreams?

490
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,433
To walk on the moon.

491
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,319
Walk on the moon?

492
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,269
Why not?

493
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,713
Some man will do it
before I even see Paris.

494
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,438
Traveling is my dream.

495
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,914
For it to come true.
An old family custom.

496
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,151
Thanks.

497
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,070
Never say thanks.

498
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,475
Never!

499
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,234
Had any adventures?

500
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,589
Yeah, lots.

501
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,069
I'm Lucky Luke.

502
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,276
''Lucky Luke vs. the Daltons''...

503
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,794
I meant...

504
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,669
adventures...

505
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,828
in love.

506
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,276
Hold on.

507
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:41,876
What?

508
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,153
We squashed a snail.

509
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,515
Like my dad's hand.

510
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,313
The hand of a farmer.

511
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,274
Damn!

512
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,834
Farming is a pain.

513
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,758
This is no life for you.

514
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,069
Look at yourself.

515
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,398
You've even lost your luck.

516
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,598
You've become unlucky, Luke.

517
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,270
You're right.

518
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,797
You hit the nail on the head.

519
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,516
You okay, man?

520
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,068
Want some more?

521
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:20,995
Dumb ass!

522
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,428
Night, man.

523
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,109
Thanks.

524
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,758
Don't even try to change.

525
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,913
Some hero!

526
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:52,592
Goodnight!

527
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,188
I love you Belle. You're so soft.

528
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,989
So pretty.

529
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,913
But so damn hairy!

530
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,070
I love you Belle. You're so pretty.

531
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,232
Chill out, Lulu! Cowboy, wake up!

532
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,631
- Come closer.
- He's petting me!

533
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,916
- What is this?
- No touching!

534
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,832
Are you out of your mind?

535
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,270
Sorry, man! Come back!

536
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,789
Come back, Jolly!

537
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,878
BARE HAND LUKE

538
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,078
Bad guys: 84
Good guys: 41

539
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,517
Billy, we said no killing.

540
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,955
It wasn't me. I didn't kill him!

541
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,475
It wasn't me!

542
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,153
He's telling the truth.

543
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,392
McGriddle died of fright
just before the gunfight.

544
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:09,829
You see?

545
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,393
Okay... Jail.

546
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,115
- Jail!
- I just told them.

547
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,550
Oh yeah.

548
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,593
Sorry, Phil Defer.

549
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,792
Where is Luke?

550
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,039
You'll have to kill
Billy and Jesse first.

551
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,909
67 customers,
that makes 8200 dollars.

552
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,718
So long, sheriffs.

553
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,153
Honest money...

554
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,437
If the Daltons ever found out,

555
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,000
we'd be like a joke
on a lollypop stick.

556
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,999
Us! The baddest bandits in the West!

557
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,952
His blade of grass is stronger
than a cigarette!

558
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,954
What if the cowboy
is taking us for a ride?

559
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,997
What if he's tryingto escape?

560
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,433
No one can escape his fate, Billy.

561
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,709
Luke will take up arms again.

562
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,234
Fate tells me he'll take up arms...

563
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,833
starting right now!

564
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,038
''How poor they are,

565
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,430
those bereft of patience.''

566
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,548
Hamlet...

567
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:28,630
Act...

568
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,912
I'm sick of your ham!
I've eaten it for 3 days!

569
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,150
I already shot a teacher
because I hated her rhymes!

570
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,153
Yeah, keep on laughing!

571
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,153
It's the redhead
they'll read about instead.

572
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,789
I'll make history
and I'm starting now!

573
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,198
Damned right, flea-bite!

574
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,352
Jesse James.
Act I, scene 1 .

575
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,594
You okay, Jesse?

576
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,075
Night falls fast on El Paso...

577
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,355
This grass ain't made for smoking.

578
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,755
Sure ain't.

579
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:12,993
- Don't be stupid, Defer.
- You owe me for 5 years in prison!

580
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,628
You stand no prayer

581
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,276
with Phil Defer!

582
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,709
Don't move!

583
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,593
I'll be fine...

584
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,679
Sure, you will be.
It's a shoulder wound.

585
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,750
I'll have your lambkins
up and walking.

586
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,588
I'm sorry.

587
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,119
Never say sorry.

588
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,469
Cowboy!

589
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,669
Lucky Luke!

590
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,639
Where are you off to?

591
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,199
Saying bye to a pal.

592
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,753
- You want to leave?
- Yes. The two of us.

593
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,949
I won't follow you to kingdom come!

594
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,599
It's not that far.

595
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,149
I know a lake, with a log cabin.

596
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,072
Fish and clovers...

597
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:57,551
Jolly loves clovers.
Agood place to raise horses.

598
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,549
And kids.

599
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,835
Kids?

600
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,636
I meant to tell you some day...

601
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:09,479
I think it's about time...
to get married.

602
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:11,629
And have kids.

603
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,029
Thanks, I...

604
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,715
It may not mean much to you, man...

605
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,712
But Belle's the girl for me.

606
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,791
And don't feel
you have to come along.

607
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,397
First of all: I'm not a man.

608
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,996
Second: your saloon dancer
isn't worth a coyote fart!

609
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,952
Don't tell me you thought...

610
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,111
What?

611
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,828
Sorry, man... Calamity.
I apologize.

612
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,596
I'm not saying
you can't settle down.

613
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,432
It's that... You understand!

614
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,436
You need a girl who's a legend too.

615
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:43,829
Agirl...

616
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:44,990
like you!

617
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,914
Exactly.
I wasn't meant to be a legend.

618
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,275
Me neither.

619
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,910
I usedto want to run
a Ladies Saloon.

620
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,479
Drink tea.

621
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,630
Bake cakes...

622
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,233
It's my right!

623
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:00,235
You barely know her!
How do you know she loves you?

624
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,392
How do I know?
She risked her life for me!

625
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,879
Risked her life?

626
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:11,108
What do you think I do?
Sit around plucking my raccoon?

627
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,517
I'll tear every bone
from his stinking carcass,

628
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,672
use his ribs for a ladder
and piss on his face!

629
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:18,756
Son of a hyena!

630
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,638
Strange guy, that gal.

631
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,790
Mr. Cooper
is waiting in the sun room.

632
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,632
Thanks. Can you feedJolly?

633
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,518
It's taken care of, Mr. Luke.

634
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,877
Very nice. Fit for a horse!

635
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:56,836
Come in, John.

636
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,269
Coop...

637
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,518
How is she doing?

638
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:12,195
You know already?

639
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:15,750
In the West
news travels fast as a bullet.

640
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,669
I can't surprise you.

641
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:24,310
Have you forgotten
I think faster than my shadow?

642
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:27,433
Goose deuce,
codfish flush, ace-in-the-sole.

643
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:31,670
That.

644
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:32,989
Very well, sir.

645
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:34,991
Open it.

646
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,428
You set sail from Baltimore
in a week.

647
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,317
First stop, Dublin.

648
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,077
You can meet your cousins.

649
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,195
I didn't intend to go so far.

650
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:58,035
Without your gun,
how will you protect your wife?

651
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,149
You've sent half the country
to jail.

652
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,192
You'll never be safe here.

653
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,589
If I were you, I'd move to France.

654
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,394
Or Belgium.

655
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,039
You could do a show.

656
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,556
Or sell your sketches,
if you still can draw.

657
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,913
Take the tickets.

658
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,040
You can't live in the West
without a gun.

659
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,599
If he'd understoodthis,

660
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,996
your father
would have done the same.

661
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:32,195
I owe you one.

662
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,233
Be happy with your wife.
Have lots of kids.

663
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:36,869
That's enough for me.

664
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,592
I'll miss you, John.

665
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:30,669
''He that ceases to be a friend
never was one.''

666
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:32,876
Act III, scene 4. Othello.

667
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,349
Shakespeare.

668
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,953
You left this
on your parents' gravestone.

669
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,599
I want what I'm owed.

670
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,799
Aduel, to fuel the history books.

671
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,553
Forget it, Jesse.

672
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,393
You know it's over.

673
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,758
Get your gun
or I'll widen her a-hole.

674
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,635
I mean the hole in her arm.

675
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,797
''A'' as in arm. You understood.

676
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,955
The hole in her arm. Her arm-hole.

677
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,633
I'll make it bigger.

678
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,436
I'll give her another a-hole.
Asecond one. Bigger.

679
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,232
I see why you need Shakespeare.

680
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,188
Get your Colt.

681
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,993
You know that I won't.

682
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,190
You have no reason to shoot Belle.

683
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,155
It's raining.

684
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:36,636
Yep.

685
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:38,959
You're still in the West.

686
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,357
To lay down the law,
you have to carry a gun.

687
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,349
Pick up your Colt.

688
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:47,715
Or die.

689
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,432
If I end up with lead in me,

690
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,158
at least it'll be from you.

691
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:55,915
No, John!

692
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,390
Say farewell to your cowboy, lady.

693
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,234
No way, José!

694
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,272
You sure shut up the poet!

695
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,353
Finally a fair duel!

696
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,311
Give him a gun!

697
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,958
''Give him a gun!''

698
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,554
Want a gun?

699
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,235
- Don't get wet.
- No more games, Billy.

700
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,997
You stole my childhood, Luke.

701
01:07:58,520 --> 01:07:59,635
I'll steal your old age.

702
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:01,634
With your Colt.

703
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,554
Blanks...

704
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:19,637
Wait!

705
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,718
You said
you'd never shoot your gun again!

706
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,519
It's not mine.

707
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,159
Hold on, Lulu!

708
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,153
It was just a joke!

709
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,276
To impair you.
No, to scare you!

710
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,233
- Who put in blanks?
- No one.

711
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,118
- Who?
- No one!

712
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:40,712
I've had my eyes on your gun
since Jesse took it from the grave!

713
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:25,832
I had no choice.
It was that or be killed.

714
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:46,158
Poker promised me
I could leave with you.

715
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,518
John, please forgive me!

716
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,348
We'll have a family... kids...

717
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:58,597
The boat's waitingfor us!

718
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,672
John, don't go, please!

719
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:04,713
Stop calling me John.
I'm Lucky Luke!

720
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,875
Holy guacamole!
What's going on?

721
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,749
- Sorry, Sam.
- Lucky Luke!

722
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,155
Your gun!

723
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,156
You alone?

724
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,109
The bandits left at dawn.

725
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:45,272
The others are at the station,
waiting for the President.

726
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:46,955
The train...

727
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,039
It's over 4 hours late now.

728
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,875
The President...

729
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,830
Right. The tracks were wiped clean.

730
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,913
The arrows smell of sequoia sap
and whiskey.

731
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,876
They want to frame the Indians.

732
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,239
Poker to a tee!

733
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,150
You were right.

734
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,269
Saloon dancers
aren't worth a coyote fart!

735
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,879
You're a real pal.

736
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,433
The President pardoned me once.

737
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,479
I owe him one.

738
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:09,514
Wait for me!

739
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:11,639
I want to come too!

740
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,992
History is me!

741
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,988
- What's that horse?
- It's a rental.

742
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,032
I promisedto return it
to its owner

743
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,193
before I shot him!

744
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:29,508
Where are we going?

745
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,157
There's nothing this way.

746
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,676
Except sure-fire death.

747
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:38,711
Yep.

748
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,953
''He who dies this year
is all square

749
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:44,309
with next year!''

750
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,115
Hot diggity dead dog!

751
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,551
I'll be a monkey's uncle!

752
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,114
It's a mirage.

753
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:32,116
It was hidden behind a mirage.

754
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,112
Aone-armed bandit!

755
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:41,159
Looks more like a gigantic
slot machine...

756
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,592
Aone-armed bandit, that is.

757
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,675
How do we get in?

758
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,672
Looks like your luck's back.

759
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:26,392
Billy, Jesse, try the back.
I'll try the front.

760
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:29,438
Exactly what I had planned.

761
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:33,554
But I don't like
getting orders from you.

762
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:42,476
Want a boost?

763
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,429
Thanks, man.

764
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:08,949
''To be...

765
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,078
''or not to be.

766
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,152
''That is the question.''

767
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,911
I was good, huh? I acted well!

768
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,674
You're an outlaw, not an actor.
Let's go.

769
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:25,953
I'm not an actor?

770
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,428
Say that again.

771
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:30,592
You're an actor.
An amazing actor, Jesse.

772
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,792
Best actor in the West.

773
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,228
You're Sarah Bernhardt,
only hairier.

774
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:41,872
You're a shitty actor!

775
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,308
What do I do? Watch the ponies?

776
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,399
I'll play solitaire.

777
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:20,114
Two cards.

778
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,873
Lucky Luke vs. Pat Poker.

779
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:34,431
Doesn't it feel like déjà vu
from another life?

780
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,034
I'm all in.

781
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:38,713
Careful, President.

782
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:40,875
Your life's at stake.

783
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:42,309
Set him free or...

784
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:44,429
Or what?

785
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,229
You'll kill me?

786
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:47,515
You've forgotten.

787
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,399
I'm already dead.

788
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:51,439
That's magic!

789
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,430
Poker... I think I've won.

790
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,989
I call you.

791
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:59,632
Straight flush, hearts.

792
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,275
Good going!

793
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,673
Full house.

794
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,872
Aces high.

795
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:10,717
Pathetic.

796
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:14,676
Kill them!

797
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:18,193
I'm counting on Luke
and his lucky star.

798
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,552
It better be a shooting star.

799
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:29,669
Hey, girls!

800
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,118
Billy, trying to look taller?

801
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,277
At least I don't walk on my coat!

802
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,750
- Done reloading?
- Relax. I have 2 guns.

803
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:51,395
Those morons
won't even see us come in.

804
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:52,516
One, two...

805
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:53,471
Five!

806
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,394
You're right, Billy.
They all fell for it.

807
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,589
The stage door's always in the back.

808
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,716
You ugly mugs...

809
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,433
no more slugs?

810
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:16,750
Quad aces, Poker.

811
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,356
In a dead end,
nothing like a friend.

812
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,436
That's us!

813
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,796
Kill the President!

814
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:46,788
Jesse, the President!

815
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:56,991
You okay?

816
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:59,276
''My will is my body's gardener.''

817
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:01,679
Othello. Act I, scene 3.

818
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,598
Kill the President!

819
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,359
Behind you, Caca!

820
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,432
Stop calling me Caca!

821
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:23,748
Thanks, Kyky!

822
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:24,910
Kill the President!

823
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:33,076
It's not my fault!

824
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,118
I swear on the life of...

825
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,469
On whose life?

826
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:41,595
On Belle's life, how's that?
Honestly, it should do.

827
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,229
On Belle's life...

828
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,034
You wait here.

829
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,395
Watch out, John!

830
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,829
Why didn't you take that boat, John?

831
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:33,675
Coop?

832
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,678
You can't be behindthis!

833
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,199
You should have left!

834
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,270
How could you? This is crazy!

835
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:01,869
I'll be President!

836
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:03,628
Agreat President!

837
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:45,516
I knew no bullet could kill you!

838
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,709
I had to destroy you from within!

839
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:54,910
From within!

840
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,269
I knew it! I knew it!

841
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:40,189
I knew killing a man would kill you!

842
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:44,436
I knew it!

843
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:58,150
Give up, Cooper.

844
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,916
- You've lost.
- Remember, John.

845
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:04,598
Cheaters never lose... Never!

846
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,758
The Cheaters' Gang.

847
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:08,838
You were one of them.

848
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:13,309
It's you.

849
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,313
You killed my parents.

850
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:17,429
It's you.

851
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:35,954
Your father...

852
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,072
was a brother to me.

853
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,038
Until he met that...

854
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,038
that filthy Indian squaw!

855
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:45,271
Who became your mother.

856
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:49,437
He wanted to turn us in.

857
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:54,318
He left me no choice.

858
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:57,913
Like you, today.

859
01:26:58,160 --> 01:26:59,798
Don't deceive yourself.

860
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:01,749
I won't think twice.

861
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:03,632
I didn't hesitate either...

862
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:07,956
To kill your mother...
to kill your father.

863
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:09,395
So do it, John.

864
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:10,749
Kill me!

865
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:13,518
Kill me if you're a man.

866
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:19,873
I can draw,

867
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,669
sing... collect medals...

868
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:25,710
I can even speak a little Horse.

869
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:29,748
But I can't kill.

870
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,079
Farewell then!

871
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:06,032
You had it all built backwards.

872
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,756
Everything but the ''C''
on your hat.

873
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:17,988
The hat...

874
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:43,270
500 feet, John.

875
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:46,754
Fantastic!

876
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:54,948
Here, John.

877
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:57,039
Try this now.

878
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,274
With this...

879
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,392
you'll be a man.

880
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:04,636
Squeeze... tight!

881
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,553
The badge looked good on you.

882
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:35,155
But it made holes in my outfit, sir.

883
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:36,753
The cripple meant me!

884
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,036
The United States
needs men like you,

885
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,713
courageous and honest.

886
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:44,469
I don't like this.
What flavor is it?

887
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:47,473
The flavor
of a change of profession.

888
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:50,951
Gentlemen, I can offer you
150 dollars pay

889
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:55,273
and no job security,
but the prestige of the badge.

890
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:58,876
Like you, my face belongs on posters,
my name in books.

891
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:02,351
Me too.
But my name in bigger letters.

892
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,552
In that case, gentlemen...

893
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,750
I suggest you be
as far away as possible

894
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,718
when these cigars go out.

895
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:13,270
''Mercy is not strained.
It drops from heaven

896
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:16,398
''as a gentle rain.
It blesses him that gives

897
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:18,119
''and him that takes.''

898
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:21,158
The Merchant of Venice. Act IV.

899
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:22,435
Scene 1 .

900
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:24,834
Beginner's luck.

901
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:26,236
Lolly, Pops?

902
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,755
There they are! Goddamn scumbags!

903
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,630
- Game of poker?
- Get in!

904
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:43,390
10 blind, andflush beats straight!

905
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:44,629
Shut up!

906
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,359
Shut up, you oldfart!

907
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:48,670
Shut up, you very oldfart!

908
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,035
I knew it!

909
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:59,717
Go to hell! Filthy lout!

910
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:09,633
I swear I didn't know.

911
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:13,395
Poker said you'd change.
I wantedto give you a family.

912
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,638
-To give us a chance.
- Achance for what?

913
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:20,192
When you put in the blanks,
we hadn't even met.

914
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:24,956
I always loved you, Johnny Johnny.

915
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:36,796
Eleanor! Eleanor's in love!

916
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:39,675
Someday I'll marry you,
Johnny Johnny.

917
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:42,873
I don't love you, Eleanor!
I love no one!

918
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,554
Eleanor?

919
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:52,879
But you were so...

920
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:57,068
I was awful with you. I'm sorry.

921
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,433
I'm leaving, John.

922
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:02,958
Paris, London, Rome...
My dream awaits me.

923
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:05,948
I wish you the best.

924
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:08,639
An old family custom.

925
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:16,548
They're kissing!

926
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:19,233
I'll always love you.

927
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,039
Save your death for me, Luke Lucky.
Jesse James, end of Act I.

928
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:37,433
But it'll be me
who smokes your hide!

929
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:39,750
Lollypop?

930
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:44,875
Farewell, Lucky Luke.
Or rather...

931
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:46,839
See you around!

932
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:49,514
Real friends, huh?

933
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:52,430
We're all wild brats
of the Wild West.

934
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:55,035
Your steam horse
won't change a thing.

935
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,318
My dear friends,

936
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,599
dear friends of Daisy Town...

937
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:14,031
What have you done with my gifts?

938
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:17,875
On Judgment Day
one of us can hold his head high.

939
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:20,953
Thanks to him... your town is free!

940
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,795
The railroad
will span the United States.

941
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:28,634
And I'm alive to see it happen!

942
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:33,598
Thank you... Lucky.

943
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:34,670
Don't mention it.

944
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:35,875
So...

945
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:39,273
So I solemnly do bestow upon him

946
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:41,678
the Hero's Star.

947
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:45,039
The twenty-first of our great flag.

948
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,911
Where is he?

949
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:51,152
He has that medal already.
I'll hang it over my bar.

950
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:52,719
It's tea time!

951
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:54,428
Drinks for everyone!

952
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:57,353
Earl Grey, Indian Breakfast,
Ceylan and cookies!

953
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,159
There's whisky too.

954
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:06,075
Miss, do you need a pianist
in your tea room?

955
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:08,834
Maybe I do.
Can you make cookies?

956
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:10,513
I do wicked apple strudel.

957
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:13,320
Change your clothes
and call meJane.

958
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:34,515
Can't you finish the song someday?

959
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:35,431
Yep.

960
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:36,396
Go ahead!

961
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,638
Let's not start bickering now!

962
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,950
I don't know how the song ends.

963
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:43,031
I'll tell you how it goes.

964
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:45,999
I got a gorgeous, handsome horsey!

965
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,069
- Know that part?
- No, I don't.

966
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,469
Yes, you do.

967
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:51,757
Then I have
another possibility.

968
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,959
The real hero
is the mustang...

969
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:57,714
Whose hum-hum
goes bang-bang!

970
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:59,712
I have an idea.
Just shut up.

971
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:02,029
Excellent.

972
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:05,109
Like the man says:
me hero, you horse.

973
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:24,754
Enjoy the scenery.

974
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:30,839
Look at that sunset.

975
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:32,433
It's pretty pretty.

976
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:37,474
By golly, Jolly!

977
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:39,235
Jolly?

978
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:46,556
- Try to act jolly, Jolly.
- Okay.

979
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:52,514
Hey!

980
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:57,076
My name's Lucky Luke.
I quit smoking in 1983.

981
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:59,231
I'm much better now.
