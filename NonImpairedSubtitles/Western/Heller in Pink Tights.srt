1
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:01,255
- Go on, William!
- Yes, sir.

2
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,767
After them, Sheriff!

3
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:16,801
Come on!

4
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,107
After them!

5
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,016
They're coming closer, William!

6
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:41,998
Let them out!

7
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,545
What are you doing? Keep after them.
They're getting away.

8
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,909
They got away.

9
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:04,379
That there writ ain't no good
west of Nebraska, Mr. Hodges.

10
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,391
"Speak the speech."

11
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,687
"Speak the speech, I pray you,
as I pronounced it to you...

12
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:55,660
"trippingly on the tongue; but if you
mouth it, as many of your players do...

13
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,536
- "I hed as lief..."
- Not "hed." "Had."

14
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,197
- "I had."
- Head, had.

15
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:03,674
"...had as lief
the town crier spoke my lines."

16
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,536
What are they up to now, baby?

17
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,386
They're just rehearsing, Mama.

18
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,045
So he's forgiven her.

19
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,684
This is the third time that she's gone off
on a buying spree...

20
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,287
picked herself out a whole new wardrobe
and charged it to Healy.

21
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,159
So we have to skip town.

22
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,997
Doesn't he know that if the law
ever catches up with us, he'll lose his show?

23
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:35,105
My clothes can't stand
another horserace with a sheriff.

24
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,638
It's Angie's fault.
She'll be the ruination of us all.

25
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,407
- She is fun, Mama.
- She's a flirt.

26
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,242
And a teaser.

27
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:49,114
- What's a teaser, Mama?
- Never you mind, baby. You're too innocent.

28
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:53,856
She just looks at a man,
and right away he starts...

29
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:57,685
scraping sand with both feet.
Look at Tom Healy.

30
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,324
He doesn't know
whether he's coming or going.

31
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,396
Thinking she'll marry him.

32
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,001
Why should he marry her
when they already go to...

33
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,299
Tut-tut.

34
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,297
He'll never have any peace
until he does marry her.

35
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,842
And he knows it.

36
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,441
And neither will she.

37
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,907
Do you think that
she'll give up her freedom?

38
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,384
No, sirree...

39
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:23,086
she won't give up her freedom.
She's too full of the dickens.

40
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,788
One of these days she's gonna be caught.
Just watch and see.

41
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,455
She is going to be caught,
and it'll be the ruination of us all.

42
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,771
How do you do?

43
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,714
Mr. Montague.

44
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,719
When I was a young actor,
I used to worry about my voice holding out.

45
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,189
- Now it's my kidneys.
- Oh, ladies?

46
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,124
Mrs. Hathaway.

47
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,863
Miss Southby.

48
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,203
- Baby, pull your skirt down.
- Yes, Mama.

49
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,829
Miss Rossini.

50
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,255
Allow me.

51
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,321
- I'm Pierce. You Healy?
- At your service.

52
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:14,195
The Great Healy Dramatic
and Concert Company's arrived...

53
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,326
to entertain, amaze, and amuse.

54
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,970
- You'd better.
- May I present our players?

55
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,600
- Miss Della Southby.
- Della, the unapproachable.

56
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,041
Our charming soubrette.

57
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,672
Known far and wide, Mr. Pierce,
as the leading child actress on the stage.

58
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,978
And Mrs. Lorna Hathaway, the divine.

59
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,540
What's her changes?

60
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,052
Flute-playing and bird calls.

61
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,615
And Mr. Manfred Montague.

62
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,349
Master of villainy and 26 dialects.

63
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,221
And last, but far from least...

64
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:46,322
direct from her performance before the
crowned heads of Europe, her native land...

65
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,495
and famed for her feats of prestidigitation,
Miss Angela Rossini.

66
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,504
Now you're talking, Healy.

67
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,812
A well-dressed man like you, Mr. Pierce...

68
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,180
you need a flower for your buttonhole.

69
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,976
Very clever. Now, little lady...

70
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:11,421
if you'd like to see the theater,
I have the best theater in Cheyenne.

71
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,858
Our town has got 22 of them,
but my theater is the very best.

72
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:19,064
Mr. Pierce, you have someone
to take our pictures.

73
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,792
How sweet of you.

74
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,898
Look, Tom, a photographer.

75
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,368
Places, everyone.

76
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,136
What are you doing? I'm taking a picture.
You're in the way.

77
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,875
All right, boys, lift them up.

78
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,438
All together.
Get a good hold, don't let them slip.

79
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,038
- They're sure heavy, ain't they?
- It's all that lead in them.

80
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,087
I've got to get this
before they stiffen up too much.

81
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,623
How were they killed?

82
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,023
Killed in a gunfight. This way, folks.

83
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:50,721
Mabry!

84
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,867
I'll take your gun now, Mabry.

85
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,116
For a minute there I thought
we were gonna have a dead sheriff.

86
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:16,143
Professional killer. Folks, follow me.
The theater's right up this way.

87
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,022
Lock him up, Sheriff.

88
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,824
- You got to lock him up.
- I got no grounds, Santis.

89
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,735
- He made them draw.
- That ain't enough, you know that.

90
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,535
You'll get this back
when you leave town, Mabry.

91
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,372
Who's paying you, Mabry?

92
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,070
Who wants the three of us dead?

93
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,648
De Leon?

94
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,916
That's who it is, ain't it?

95
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,114
Because we won't sell out to him.

96
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,954
Well, it's our claim.
He ain't got no right to our claim.

97
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,029
And he don't run Cheyenne
like he does Bonanza.

98
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,928
We got the law on our side here.

99
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,797
Yes, sir, you sure have.
You got it right here on your side.

100
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,803
- Save the boards, we might need 'em again.
- Who tied these knots?

101
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:09,034
You better hope it does you
more good than it did them.

102
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,842
Got the latest equipment
straight from Chicago.

103
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,749
I've got this whole setup
for the people who want action back here.

104
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,482
That is, if they ain't getting it on the stage.

105
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,285
Fine bar you have here, too.

106
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,882
It's genuine mahogany.

107
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,360
I've got your contracts up in my office.
They're all made out.

108
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,521
Yes, sir, a fine piece of old mahogany.

109
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,626
You see, we consider this engagement
as we would New York or Philadelphia.

110
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:41,696
The Healy Company, Mr. Pierce, has
the same high standards of performance.

111
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,901
My throat is so dry.

112
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,907
The stage is right out that way.

113
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,503
- There you are, my dear.
- Thank you, dearie.

114
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,846
It's this accursed dust.

115
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,649
Recovered, Mrs. Hathaway?

116
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,882
Toute recovered, Mr. Montague.

117
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,122
Baby.

118
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,494
Miss Rossini.

119
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,663
Yes?

120
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,368
You can come up here, too.
I'd like to show you my office.

121
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,967
Thank you very much.

122
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:26,180
- Now, it ain't very big, but it's cozy.
- It's lovely.

123
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,221
Nothing to read there, Healy.
Same deal I give all the shows.

124
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:30,778
- I think that...
- Now.

125
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,889
Look right through this window
and you can see the actors.

126
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,087
You have a charming proscenium,
Mr. Pierce.

127
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,425
Over here.

128
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:42,400
Look this way and I can see my dealers.

129
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,936
Keeps them on their toes,
knowing I can see them.

130
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:48,838
Yes, very clever. Mr. Pierce, my
understanding was we were to split 70-30.

131
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,172
- You have it 30-70.
- Same numbers.

132
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:54,235
- Yes, but in the wrong place.
- I'll fix it later.

133
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,338
You said you have some house scenery?

134
00:11:56,415 --> 00:12:00,215
- Sure. Loads of it. Right through there.
- I'd like to see it.

135
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,415
After you, Miss Rossini.

136
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,217
I'll come along.
I want to look at your lovely pictures.

137
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:11,992
I've got everything. Everything from
center-door fancy to kitchen and woods.

138
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,052
- "Whether 'tis nobler in the mind..."
- All right.

139
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,822
Folks, there's no dressing rooms,
so you'll dress in the hotel.

140
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,728
It's right through this door here.

141
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,824
It's the best hotel in Cheyenne.

142
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,485
Mabry, I wanna talk to you.

143
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:13,723
You back, Santis?

144
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,718
Mabry, how much you want
to leave me alone?

145
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:21,032
You got Jensen and Slote.
Me, I'm the only one that's left.

146
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,729
I ain't going up for that claim.
You can tell De Leon he can keep it all...

147
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,238
like he wants. Me, I'm running.
Ain't that enough?

148
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,796
- What more does he want?
- Ask him.

149
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,865
I'm asking you. I'm begging you.

150
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,137
Don't beg.

151
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,310
You ain't no dog.

152
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,544
You're a man. Don't beg.

153
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,057
Tom!

154
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,927
- Yes, Angie?
- Don't leave me.

155
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:02,166
Wait a minute. Nobody's leaving you.

156
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,676
Is that for something you did
or something you're going to do?

157
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,277
For nothing.

158
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,048
For you.

159
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,355
- Angie.
- Yes?

160
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,324
Angie, now you know that we're broke.

161
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:31,896
If we don't make it here,
I don't know what we'll do. So, Angie...

162
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:36,730
- Angie, please, no tricks?
- But what could I do?

163
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,505
Angie, no monkey business, huh?

164
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:55,657
Signed, Mabry. Let me read this back to you,
Mr. Mabry. It goes to Mr. De Leon...

165
00:14:56,128 --> 00:15:00,497
- Miners Exchange, Bonanza. Is that right?
- That's right.

166
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,838
A wire from Cheyenne, Mr. De Leon.
From Mabry.

167
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:18,609
Says he's filled two of the orders and thinks
he can deliver the third right quick.

168
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,411
Get ready the money
you're going to owe him for the job.

169
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,785
I sure wouldn't mind
some of what he's gonna get.

170
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:27,622
You will never be a businessman, Goober.
You part with money much too easily.

171
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,093
To owe is one thing, to pay is quite another.

172
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,356
Giddap.

173
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,291
What's he mean by that?

174
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:36,100
I ain't sure, but I'm glad I ain't Mabry.

175
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:46,005
You look lovely, honey.
Lorna, aren't you two ready yet?

176
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,945
- Yes, Tom.
- You're holding up the rehearsal, baby.

177
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:52,915
You know, you still look pretty good.
Honey, get ready.

178
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,152
We're rehearsing. Come on. Music.

179
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,902
I fear you not and laugh at your anger.

180
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,440
For I have proved my courage in battle.

181
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,568
- A vile seducer outrages...
- What's that?

182
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:56,441
- What's what?
- What did he just say?

183
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,377
"A vile seducer."

184
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,316
That's what I thought he said.

185
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:04,015
What kind of a show
are you giving here, anyway?

186
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,182
This is a comic opera, Mr. Pierce.

187
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:09,294
La Belle Hélène.
You know, the story of Helen of Troy?

188
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,420
It's one of our big, big successes.

189
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,089
You see, in this I play Paris.

190
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,326
He's a son of the king of Troy, and he's...

191
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,767
- The handsomest man in the world.
- Him?

192
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,897
- Yes.
- Of course, I wear heavy makeup.

193
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,698
What part do you play?

194
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,471
I play Hélène. The most beautiful woman.

195
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,078
That I can believe.

196
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,912
And this is my husband.

197
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,616
- You married?
- No. In the play.

198
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:36,687
But I'm not in love with my husband.
I am, how do you say, flighty?

199
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,219
And besides, he is much older than I am.

200
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:43,318
Always wanting me to behave myself
and to do what he thinks is good for me.

201
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,660
But I'm young and very beautiful,
and do only what I enjoy.

202
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,925
Nope. It won't go in Cheyenne.

203
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,766
- No?
- But this is a classic, Mr. Pierce.

204
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,399
What's so classy about her running around
with you instead of her husband?

205
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,501
But he is so much nicer,
and he lets me do what I want.

206
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:03,275
Last month, the mayor's wife started
running around with a young stud like him...

207
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:06,408
and the mayor shot him stone dead.
There wasn't a man in town...

208
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:09,784
that didn't shake his hand for doing it,
even the sheriff.

209
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:14,087
No, Healy, you can't get away with
making fun out of marriage in Cheyenne.

210
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,591
But it's all right to kill people in Cheyenne?

211
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,392
Mr. Pierce, why don't you wait
until you see the show...

212
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,956
with the pretty costumes
and the orchestra playing...

213
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,662
And the customers leaving?
Chew up a little scenery...

214
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:27,364
that's what they want around here:
Blood and thunder.

215
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,772
If all you got is this fiddle-faddle,
you can pack up and keep going.

216
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,208
I don't want you.

217
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,270
You're losing your charm, baby.

218
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:38,743
Well, Doc?

219
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:42,078
All right, we'll rehearse later.

220
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,370
Tom?

221
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:10,838
- Hi, Angie. Look.
- What?

222
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:15,449
That's what goes here in Cheyenne,
cheap acrobats.

223
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:23,259
Since we can't do La Belle Hélène,
we should do...

224
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,323
Mazeppa.

225
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,796
That has a lot of blood and thunder,
and a man on a wild horse.

226
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:32,166
- You mean a dummy filled with straw.
- The horse is real.

227
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:34,933
But they see real horses out here
all the time.

228
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,738
We should do Mazeppa...

229
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,201
but I'll do the ride.

230
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,878
- You play a man?
- I play a man.

231
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,575
- Come on, it's dangerous.
- Why?

232
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,312
They'd have to tie you on the horse,
he might throw you.

233
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,911
- We would be a big success.
- Not if you were hurt.

234
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,980
You worry too much.
About me, about the show...

235
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,621
Somebody has to worry.

236
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,692
You know, the wolves are at our door.

237
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:03,197
We don't satisfy Pierce, we don't eat.

238
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,160
We'll eat the wolves.

239
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,936
Pierce is a big fool.

240
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,741
- But he owns the theater.
- He should own a stable.

241
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,377
You should own this theater.

242
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,407
It should be the Healy Theater.

243
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,284
The Healy Company and the Healy Theater.

244
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,980
That's a lot of Healy.

245
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,250
You'd put on all the best plays.

246
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,957
You'd be very successful.

247
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,824
- And what would you be?
- The star.

248
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:38,926
And people would come all the way
from San Francisco to see me do...

249
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,165
the wild horse ride from Mazeppa.

250
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:49,012
Tom, I was just trying to help, you know.

251
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,115
That helps.

252
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:04,522
You know, Angie,
I've been knocking around for a long time.

253
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,959
It'd be nice to settle down...

254
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,902
and maybe you and me...

255
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:17,965
Tom, you're getting too serious now.

256
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,742
Well, now, you...

257
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:27,845
You come out here
and you say you want to help.

258
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,882
You know how I feel.

259
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,547
A little help here, a little help there...

260
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,684
and right away we are married.

261
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,389
Look, you haven't been asked yet.

262
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,671
Why are you so angry?
Because I tell you the truth?

263
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:53,341
Listen, you do so much for me.
No one has ever done so much.

264
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:57,337
- And now that I want to help you...
- Look, you want to help?

265
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,316
- Of course I do.
- Go and put on a kimono.

266
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,917
You get me so mixed up,
I don't know which one to put on.

267
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:14,725
The red one.

268
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,169
Sometimes I don't know what you want.

269
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,340
I want everything.

270
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,343
You want too much.

271
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,845
Angie, why don't you go
and get some sleep?

272
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:36,012
We have a big day tomorrow,
trying to decide what to do.

273
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,886
You might have to start practicing
on that horse.

274
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:48,790
Love and honor unite around my wishes.

275
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:53,460
Still, the extraordinary emotion
of Olinska haunt me...

276
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,803
her disturbed looks,
her eyes moist with tears.

277
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,940
For what is her hand without her heart?

278
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,610
Who art thou?

279
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,075
Thy rival.

280
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:06,984
What is thy will, thou brash intruder?

281
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,554
- Thy death.
- Coward.

282
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,880
If our arms were equal...

283
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:16,587
They are so. Behold, I wear no armor.

284
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,395
Aim at my heart.

285
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:22,565
It has now no defense but courage.
And this good sword.

286
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,263
Have at thee now.

287
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,285
I yield.

288
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,623
- I am revenged.
- Guard.

289
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:54,531
Great Heavens! The Palatine assassinated.

290
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,994
My rival.

291
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,364
Vengeance!

292
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,405
You shall obtain it,
and whoever the murderer may prove...

293
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:01,996
it will be terrible.

294
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:06,066
That is my assassin.

295
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,447
Remove the mantle that conceals the wretch.

296
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:11,607
No.

297
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:18,379
Mazeppa, Prince of Tartary!

298
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,084
Kill him!

299
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:22,852
No!

300
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:25,591
Stand back! Back, Olinska.

301
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:29,500
He shall suffer the penalty
inflicted on rebel slaves.

302
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:32,466
Bring forth the fiery, untamed horse.

303
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,869
Tie that vile Tartar on his back
and turn him loose.

304
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,506
Strip him of his clothes.

305
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,977
Then, let the murderer
be borne through sands...

306
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,414
and rocks and wilds...

307
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,682
till thirst and hunger, and scorching suns...

308
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,718
kill him piecemeal!

309
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,299
Where is the fiery, untamed steed?

310
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,504
Oh, my father!
Pardon for him who loves your daughter!

311
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:16,138
Unworthy girl. All the power on earth
cannot assuage my vengeance!

312
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:17,340
Dearest father.

313
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:20,942
- Dearest child, thou canst do nothing.
- In mercy, hear me.

314
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:24,620
Plead not for me, Olinska. Perish as I may...

315
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,719
it is sufficient glory that I die for thee!

316
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,352
Now launch the traitor forth!

317
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:41,663
And let the story of his fate
strike terror throughout Poland!

318
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,400
Down!

319
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,806
Angie, are you all right?

320
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:27,618
You were more scared than I was.

321
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,483
I was scared for the horse.

322
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,419
Listen to them. They like it.

323
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:34,549
Like it? They love it! Come on, let's go!

324
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:20,928
Look, everybody. Change quick.
We'll start the second act in 10 minutes.

325
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,303
There they are.

326
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:23,601
It's Hodges.

327
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,972
Thought you got away, didn't you?
Slap that plaster on them, Sheriff.

328
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,571
- Stop that woman.
- Sorry, I got a writ of attachment.

329
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,583
- It's not legal here.
- It's legal, all right.

330
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,278
I got it right here in Cheyenne.

331
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:38,049
- Will you please go and change?
- No, you're not getting out of my sight.

332
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:41,650
They're just going to the hotel, Mr. Hodges.
Now, Angie.

333
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:45,156
Excuse me.

334
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:50,364
A man claims you actors ordered a load
of dresses and skipped without paying.

335
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:53,029
- They ain't actors, they're crooks.
- What are you?

336
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:57,006
If I'd come to your room,
you would've given me the dresses free.

337
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,305
Mr. Pierce, thank goodness you are here.

338
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,845
What are you standing around for?
You got a second act.

339
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:04,006
Got to close the show, Sam.
Man here's got a writ.

340
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:07,017
- I don't care. He can't close my show.
- You want to start a riot?

341
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:09,383
Listen to the audience.
They'll tear the place down.

342
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:12,287
- We've got to finish our performance.
- Don't pay them no mind.

343
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,291
- I know this bunch.
- Where could we go?

344
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,055
- We are helpless.
- Here, little lady.

345
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:18,789
Thank you.

346
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,661
You see what I mean?
See that look in her eye?

347
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,462
You'll get your money in the morning.

348
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,763
Wait just a minute.

349
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,396
You can come back in the morning
with that paper, Ed.

350
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:30,339
- Can't, Sam.
- You're running for election again, ain't you?

351
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:33,536
- Next month.
- How many votes this out-of-town fella got?

352
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:37,076
I'll be back in the morning, Healy.
You be here.

353
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:40,879
They're gonna finish the performance.
Better have that money in the morning.

354
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:43,147
Upon my word, Mr. Pierce. Oh, Angie.

355
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:45,683
Thank you, Mr. Pierce.

356
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,952
Come on in, let's see the show. You too, Ed.

357
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,152
Fine show, Sam.

358
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:52,526
- That's my policy. Always the best.
- Fine show, Sam.

359
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:02,135
You are a kind man, Mr. Pierce.

360
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,905
- Thank you.
- I only try to help people.

361
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,534
You need any more help,
you know where to find me.

362
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,409
In your charming little office?

363
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,346
I'm there 24 hours a day.

364
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:12,980
You are kind.

365
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:22,192
Then the safe fell off the elevator
and Pat went up and down.

366
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,421
And then he fell kaplunk on the sidewalk.

367
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:28,193
Mike looked down and he said,
"Glory be, is it dead he is?"

368
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,463
- Doc.
- And he says, "Pat, speak to me, and..."

369
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:34,801
- Doc, have you seen Angie?
- No, I haven't seen her.

370
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,864
You got something figured out?

371
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:38,832
Not yet.

372
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,177
And then he said,
"Why should I speak to you?"

373
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,411
Meet Miss Della Southby.

374
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:50,411
Della, the unapproachable.
For only 50¢, for one half of $1...

375
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:52,752
you can visit. Oh, you fortunate man.

376
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:55,657
For 50 cents,
you get a picture of Miss Della.

377
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:02,967
For only 50 cents apiece,
and the very special price of $2...

378
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:04,467
- Lorna.
- What?

379
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,201
- Where's Angie?
- Have you lost her again?

380
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:12,107
Why, we haven't seen her anywhere,
Mr. Healy.

381
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,672
Haven't you seen her anywhere, baby?

382
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,445
You look at him like that again,
I'll smack you.

383
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,346
- I was only being polite.
- I'll take three.

384
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:22,352
Why don't you take Miss Della
right into your home?

385
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:27,016
She'll keep you so comfy on those cold
and Ionely nights on the range.

386
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:28,251
Good night.

387
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,056
You go back to the hotel now
and get your sleep.

388
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,489
Remember, you're not
a young man anymore.

389
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,192
I'm as young as I feel.

390
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:40,095
You look as charming in that dress
as I knew you would.

391
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,500
Thanks to you.

392
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,408
- Our troubles are gone.
- What do you mean?

393
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:51,943
Mr. Pierce has taken over the money
we owed that silly fat man.

394
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,711
Mr. Pierce is taking...

395
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:07,892
Tell me, what do you mean,
"Mr. Pierce has taken over"?

396
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:11,364
He took over what we owe for the dresses.
Now we owe him the money.

397
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:12,698
He likes us?

398
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:16,570
- He does it for business.
- Did you put up some security?

399
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,038
What could I put up?

400
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,702
I don't know.

401
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,612
We are a great success
and he wants to keep us here, that's all.

402
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:26,673
How much time is he giving you?

403
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,910
In a week, two weeks, we'll make enough...

404
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:31,979
Didn't you promise to, you know, meet him?

405
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,147
- That's later tonight.
- That's tonight?

406
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,819
- Yes, but I'll put him off.
- Oh, Angie.

407
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:44,291
Doc. Mr. Montague.

408
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:47,361
But he's easy to handle, that type.
He's so sure of himself.

409
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:48,837
What's the do?

410
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,671
We're shooting the moon.
Get the other two started, huh?

411
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,870
Just when my kidneys were settling down.

412
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:56,573
But we don't have to go.
We can pay him back in a week.

413
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,310
He won't wait a week.
This type doesn't wait at all.

414
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,284
These men are wild out here.

415
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,413
They are?

416
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:06,480
You do your pitch with Doc.
I'll see you in your room later.

417
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,991
But I'll take care. I promise you.

418
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:17,323
- I did it so we could stay.
- I know why you did it.

419
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,700
We are such a success here,
for the first time.

420
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,036
- We'll be a success someplace else.
- I make things bad for you.

421
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,870
Not ever bad.

422
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,471
Impossible, sometimes, but never bad.

423
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:31,276
I know why you're doing this, too.
Why you give up what you want.

424
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,374
I'm just trying to hold the show together.

425
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,284
- No, because you watch out for me.
- So? Is that bad?

426
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:37,616
No, never bad.

427
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:39,790
Wrong, sometimes...

428
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,353
but never bad.

429
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:49,863
You do your pitch with Doc.
I'll see you in your room later.

430
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,437
Carte de v/s/te.

431
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:55,938
We're shooting the moon.

432
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:59,170
Take the kid and make your exit
and meet me at the hotel.

433
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,274
- Thank you.
- 50 cents, gentlemen.

434
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,874
Sam, do you still want me
to keep an eye on them?

435
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,919
Nah, they ain't skipping town.

436
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,855
Not tonight, they ain't.

437
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:15,381
- You can't ever be sure with actors.
- I can be sure.

438
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,394
I'm real sure about tonight.

439
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,295
Artistic poses by Miss Angela Rossini.

440
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,297
Nothing here, nothing there. Allez- oop.

441
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,002
$1, please.

442
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:36,376
The same poses that have stirred the hearts
of the red-blooded American males...

443
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:39,382
from the great Atlantic to the blue Pacific.

444
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:49,856
$1, please.
$1 for these lively, spicy portraits.

445
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:52,987
Thank you. $1 to set
the blood tingling through your veins.

446
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:55,089
Thank you. Who wants Angela Rossini?

447
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:59,227
Take her beauty home with you tonight.
Thank you. Who wants Angela Rossini?

448
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,742
I'm going out this way.
You follow in a little while.

449
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,403
We haven't made enough money.

450
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:12,074
I'm going to see if I can make some more
so we can stay here.

451
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,675
Whatever you do, don't lose what we got.

452
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,996
I don't know why I play this darned game.
I can't win for losing.

453
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,804
- Can anyone play in this game?
- We don't have women, ma'am.

454
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:42,903
I would love to so much.
I've just learned it and it is so amusing.

455
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:47,679
Let her sit in, Tom.
Give us the best-Iooking game in town.

456
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,811
How sweet of you. Thank you.

457
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:52,916
- May I sit down?
- Yes, ma'am.

458
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:02,432
You sure had them whooping and hollering.

459
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,931
Mighty slick ride you made up there.

460
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,805
Jacks or better to open.
You know what that means, lady?

461
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,401
Well, I think so.

462
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,341
It's open.

463
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:20,946
- Cards, lady.
- Three?

464
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:23,553
- Two.
- Three for me.

465
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:26,721
Dealer takes two.

466
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:29,189
Anybody here can't afford to lose $10?

467
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,890
May I put in another $10?

468
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,834
You can put in as much as you got
there on the table, lady.

469
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,336
Just $10 for now.

470
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,070
- I'm out.
- I'll call.

471
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,043
- Not me.
- I'm out.

472
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:50,378
Is this good? Three tens?

473
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:53,115
That's good enough.

474
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,414
I like this game so much.

475
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:02,552
Hiya, Doc. Where's Angie? Is she coming?

476
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:04,219
She's right behind me.

477
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,562
- Mama?
- What, baby?

478
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,293
I can't put any more on.

479
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,060
Then carry them, darling.
It's more ladylike, anyway.

480
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:14,661
Now, remember, we're just out for a stroll.

481
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,768
Parasol.

482
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:25,977
Mother first.

483
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:30,913
$100. And $100 more.

484
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,021
Too much for me.

485
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,351
$200. And $200 more.

486
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,121
But that's all I've got. You are not allowed...

487
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,758
Table stakes, Mabry. You can't raise more
than she's got showing.

488
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,594
- That's too bad.
- Wait.

489
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:49,504
I would like to bet more, if you would.

490
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,940
Well, there it is.

491
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,512
- What're you gonna put up against it?
- Me.

492
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:03,046
You're mighty sure you're gonna win.

493
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,513
Will you take the bet?

494
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,152
All I can lose is money.

495
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:10,058
What've you got?

496
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:15,088
Four sevens.

497
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,607
Four jacks.

498
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:32,107
I hate to leave, gentlemen,
but I really have to go.

499
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,775
I'll pay you tomorrow.

500
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,145
I generally collect right after I win a pot.

501
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:38,745
- Later. Not now.
- Now.

502
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,083
Mabry!

503
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:44,157
Santis, he hasn't got a gun.

504
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,366
Turn around, Mabry.

505
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,530
I ain't gonna shoot you in the back.

506
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,665
You wait for me up in your room.

507
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,940
Sheriff!

508
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:11,082
All right, keep them back.
Stay back. Keep away.

509
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:16,288
- Mabry, this time you're not gonna get...
- He drawed on me, Sheriff.

510
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,523
- Ask any one of the boys.
- That's right, Sheriff.

511
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:21,687
I tried to stop him.

512
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:25,634
Are you gonna let him get away
with shooting up my place?

513
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,604
- You want to swear out a complaint?
- I got an engagement.

514
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:31,039
- Wait a minute.
- I've got an engagement.

515
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,938
I'll swear out a complaint:
Disturbing the peace.

516
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:35,478
Come on, Mabry.

517
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,477
All you'll do is march me down
to that judge and he's got to let me go.

518
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,074
Come on, Mabry.

519
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:15,150
Honey, I'm sorry I'm late,
but that fool sheriff...

520
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,450
Here I am, little lady.

521
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,524
What's going on in here?

522
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:07,167
- They've skipped.
- They sure ain't here.

523
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,570
I knew I never should have
put them in that room.

524
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,076
Never give actors a room with a balcony.
Don't even give them a window.

525
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,271
You mean they went out over here?

526
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,709
They'll do it every time.

527
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:20,749
And after all I done for that little lady.

528
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:30,958
I was just coming about some alterations
on Miss Rossini's dress.

529
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:34,794
I know what you was coming for,
but you're too late. They've skipped.

530
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:39,268
Why don't you go after them?
They're probably headed for Bonanza.

531
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,695
If I don't get them, the Indians will.

532
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:45,868
Passel of them just jumped the reservation.
Burning and killing all over the place.

533
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,605
- It's your money.
- No, it's not. Our deal is off.

534
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:51,614
- You guaranteed what they owed me.
- Show it to me in writing.

535
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:54,014
- I got witnesses.
- Not in this town, you ain't.

536
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:56,917
I'll take you to court.
You'll have a different tone before...

537
00:40:56,987 --> 00:41:00,081
- I'm waiting, Hodges!
- Is that so? Well, you...

538
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:36,091
I have a job for you.
Mabry's on his way back.

539
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:40,055
If he gets here,
it will cost me a great deal of money.

540
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,598
I don't want him to get here.

541
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,629
There is no sense
looking all over the country for him.

542
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,568
He has to come over the ridge road.

543
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,902
So pick a good spot and stay there...

544
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:51,906
until he comes.

545
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:54,873
All of us?

546
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,912
I hope it will be enough.
Mabry's worth six of you.

547
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:00,579
So don't give him a chance.

548
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:25,003
- Mama, did we get somewhere?
- How should I know?

549
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,109
Where's the rest of the wire?

550
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:30,947
Give me a hand with this pole.

551
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:36,544
How many more we gotta do today?

552
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,383
Keep it in line, now!

553
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,684
- Excuse me.
- What's all this?

554
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,623
The Healy Dramatic Company, sir.

555
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,456
- Show people?
- Yes, sir.

556
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:47,288
Gotta pay these men double wages
to get them out here...

557
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:49,229
and they can't even set a pole straight.

558
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,827
Excuse me, sir, is there any water
around here? We're running pretty dry.

559
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,371
- Just over that ridge there's a stream.
- Thank you.

560
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:58,966
- I see the storm pulled your wire down.
- Injuns pulled it down.

561
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:01,207
Come on, get your back into it!

562
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:02,768
Indians, around here?

563
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,481
Raiding up and down the line.

564
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:10,351
They say the cavalry's driven them up north.
That's what they say.

565
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,885
You mean these are dangerous Indians?

566
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:16,491
I ain't got these bluecoats along
just for company.

567
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:20,352
Where are they going?

568
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,426
Howdy, ma'am.

569
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,560
- Hey, lady, where'd you come from?
- Watch out.

570
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:34,507
What a surprise.

571
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:39,145
Gentlemen, Miss Della Southby.

572
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,049
Come on, baby.

573
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:44,849
Gentlemen, how would you like
to take Miss Della home with you?

574
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:48,514
For 50¢, for just one half of $1...

575
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:50,557
you may have a picture.

576
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:56,895
Mister, we're headed for Bonanza.
Surely that's safe? That's to the south.

577
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:59,092
Safe as any place in this country.

578
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:01,569
Mister, would you get
those females out of here?

579
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,006
It's hard enough putting up this wire
with the Injuns around.

580
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:10,812
- Just trying to help you.
- Carte de v/s/te, anyone?

581
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:19,213
Goodbye, boys. Come to see our show
the next time you're in town.

582
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,019
Mama, a man!

583
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,586
- Where?
- Over there.

584
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,424
- Doc!
- Yes, Lorna?

585
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:03,125
We got company.

586
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,830
- What?
- Look what's coming.

587
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:17,780
- Turn it on, Ted! They're after us again.
- Is it the sheriff?

588
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:20,874
Let's not stay to find out.
Give it all you've got.

589
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,382
Come on, you damn nags!

590
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:26,446
Hold on, baby. We're off again.

591
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,368
Ted, let them out.

592
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:41,597
- He's gaining!
- He's gaining, Ted!

593
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,655
He's gone, Mama.

594
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:05,991
He's gone. I think maybe we lost him.

595
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:14,727
- See him?
- No, I haven't seen him anywhere.

596
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,974
- Anybody home?
- Mabry.

597
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:31,946
- What are you doing out here?
- Scared you, didn't I?

598
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:33,649
We thought you were the sheriff.

599
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:36,750
He's still in Cheyenne,
figuring out where I got that other gun.

600
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,317
- What gun?
- Never mind.

601
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:40,727
- Where are you folks going?
- Bonanza.

602
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,057
Ain't that a caution? So am I.

603
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,391
- No.
- Mind if I ride along?

604
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,698
Gets kind of Ionesome riding all by yourself.

605
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:53,936
This is rough country, you never know
when you can use an extra hand.

606
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:56,479
- That might not be a...
- Tom.

607
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,976
I would like to talk with you for a moment.

608
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:02,610
- Excuse me a moment.
- I got nothing but time.

609
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:07,316
- Pretty country, ain't it?
- Don't it ever end?

610
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:12,086
Tom, why do we need him?
You have a map, you know the way.

611
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:15,393
- Just in case we run into trouble.
- What kind of trouble?

612
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:18,558
He's just going to ride along with us,
just another hand...

613
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:20,034
He is a killer.

614
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:22,903
He could kill us all in our sleep.

615
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:25,373
Angie, this man kills for money.
You have money?

616
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:26,534
No.

617
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:30,940
- Mabry. You're welcome to come along.
- Thank you kindly.

618
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,743
Ted! Let's move on.

619
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:04,443
You can make camp over there.
There's plenty of water for the horses.

620
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:07,972
I'm gonna scout around a little bit.
I might not be back till sunup.

621
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,952
Mabry. Any special reason?

622
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,546
Don't build the fires too high.

623
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:37,472
- Don't drag the costume, baby.
- Yes, Mama.

624
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,276
Mama has to wear it.

625
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:44,076
This rain certainly didn't do us any good.
This armor's a soggy mess.

626
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,017
You're doing a good job, Doc.

627
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:50,253
- Mr. Healy, I put your breakfast over there.
- Thank you, Della.

628
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:53,924
- Is Mabry back yet?
- No, not yet.

629
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:55,328
Good.

630
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:58,831
Listen, everybody. Don't go too far away.

631
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:02,827
- I'm gonna look around.
- Where would I go?

632
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:36,104
- Hello.
- Who are they, Mama?

633
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,138
They're Indians.

634
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:44,836
Maybe they live around here someplace.
Do you live around here?

635
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:06,163
You speakee English?

636
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,944
- Why, they're hungry.
- I'll fix you something to eat.

637
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,484
- Tom!
- We've got visitors. Come on.

638
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:32,655
Hello.

639
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:38,434
Will you all start moving over
towards the wagons?

640
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:40,265
Tom, I think they're hungry.

641
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:43,170
- Why, Tom? Come on.
- Just shut up and do as I say.

642
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:04,154
What did you do?

643
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,593
- They just wanted food!
- You killed them!

644
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:09,658
Maybe I ought to let them kill you.

645
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,695
Like they killed some soldier to get this.

646
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:21,969
We better move fast. The one who got away
will be back with his friends.

647
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:24,878
I figure these three for a scouting party.

648
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:26,848
Ted and Bill, where are they?

649
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:29,919
- Our drivers.
- Ted! Bill!

650
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:42,358
Mama?

651
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:47,397
Don't look, baby.

652
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:53,833
Guess we'll have to bury them.

653
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:56,572
No time for that. I'll get the horses.

654
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,541
But to leave them like this, it...

655
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,749
They don't know the difference.

656
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:11,455
We'll have to leave the wagons.
Just take what's important.

657
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:13,961
- Come on, everybody.
- Come, baby.

658
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:17,493
Doc, will you come on? Come on.

659
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:30,446
- Lorna, come on. Let's go.
- Mama.

660
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:38,377
Hey, perk up, pop.

661
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:39,989
- Hey, Healy.
- Yeah?

662
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:42,889
Better get moving. I'll go on ahead.

663
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:46,261
- Yeah, I'll send them along.
- Okay.

664
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:50,630
- Come on, Mama.
- Your costumes, baby. All your best parts.

665
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,726
Little Eva, Fanchon the Cricket,
and Mother's Helper.

666
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:57,000
Oh, Mama, throw them away.
I'm 20 years old.

667
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:01,406
- Well, I am.
- Lorna, come on, let's go.

668
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:03,309
- No.
- Come on, baby.

669
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,314
- Leave me here.
- Let's not make a scene.

670
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:07,350
- Leave me to the Indians.
- Get on your horse.

671
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:09,248
What does it matter? I'm dead already.

672
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:11,879
- My child just killed me.
- Come on, get up there, Lorna.

673
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:14,947
- Oh, baby.
- After all I've done for that girl.

674
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,191
- After all I've done for you.
- Get on!

675
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:21,196
- You know I gave up my career for her?
- Yes, I know, baby.

676
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:23,164
And she's only 16.

677
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,593
That's all she is. Everybody knows that.

678
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:27,899
- I was a baby myself when I had her.
- I know.

679
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:30,371
- Hold on to the saddle, baby.
- Della! Wait for me.

680
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,806
Angie, can you please take this?

681
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:08,121
Let's rest up.

682
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:11,398
Over there.

683
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:32,710
Why do you stay with us?
Why don't you go when you can?

684
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:35,484
I got to protect my property, ain't I?

685
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:41,395
How are your kidneys, Doc?

686
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:48,830
- Easy, Doc.
- Thanks, Healy.

687
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:52,605
- Snoogie.
- Yes, dear.

688
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:56,076
- I'll help you, Mama.
- If you would, please, Mr. Healy.

689
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:58,205
Of course, Mrs. Hathaway.

690
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:02,451
- Stretch your pretty legs.
- Thank you.

691
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:04,350
Mama, don't be mad.

692
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:17,257
- Did you see anything, Mabry?
- No sign of them.

693
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:21,334
But that don't mean anything.
We just have to keep moving.

694
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:24,974
Mabry, according to my map...

695
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:29,478
there's a mission on the way to Bonanza.

696
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:33,915
That's a long pull over rough country.
Right over that mountain.

697
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:36,379
You got snow, you got wind.

698
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:40,685
You got trails where you take
one wrong step and you're over the edge.

699
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:44,591
Look, Mabry. If you don't want
to come along, you don't have to.

700
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:47,789
You've done a lot for us.
I don't want you to feel you have to stay.

701
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:49,388
I don't mind.

702
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:53,397
I was raised to do good,
and I like to do it whenever I can.

703
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:55,805
No, I'll stay with you.

704
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:43,043
- You feel better, Doc?
- Ain't as strong as I used to be, Tom.

705
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,087
Take it easy and rest.

706
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:49,990
He better be ready to move soon.
We can't sit here too much longer.

707
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:53,517
- They can't go on like this. The women...
- I'm thinking of the women.

708
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:56,030
Them Injuns are riding without their squaws.

709
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:59,193
You keep watch.
I'm going to nose around a little bit.

710
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:03,069
And remember, if they come, you're
shooting downhill, so aim at their knees.

711
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:07,075
- Get me some branches for a fire, will you?
- What about the smoke?

712
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:10,510
We got to take that chance.
It's too cold without a fire.

713
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:14,778
Course, there's other ways of keeping warm,
but they ain't proper.

714
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:20,012
I wouldn't care if it was proper or not,
with somebody like him.

715
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:21,351
Mama.

716
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:25,053
Baby, that's a very attractive man.
Isn't he, Angie?

717
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:16,575
You look like you didn't sleep so good
last night.

718
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:18,637
I slept fine, thank you.

719
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,942
Mabry, we're in the middle
of a lot of trouble out here.

720
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,285
You know, snow and Indians,
a lot of trouble.

721
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,289
Don't make any more.

722
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,817
- I'm here to help you, Healy.
- We're very grateful.

723
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:37,264
But if I'm too much trouble for you,
all you gotta do is say "git." I'll go.

724
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:38,994
We need you, you know that.

725
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:42,902
I ain't a man to look for trouble,
but I don't run from it.

726
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:47,439
I usually run from it, but not always.

727
01:00:58,421 --> 01:01:01,322
I can't figure it.
He should have been here long ago.

728
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:03,882
You know what?
I think he's coming over the mountain.

729
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,919
- Through all that snow?
- There's Indians loose, maybe he had to.

730
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:10,722
He ain't coming this way, that's for sure.

731
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:14,027
You three wait here another couple of days,
then head on back.

732
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:16,298
I'm heading for the mountain.

733
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:18,665
You going up against Mabry alone?

734
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:21,366
He ain't looking for me, I'm looking for him.

735
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:24,538
Besides, I can spot that horse of his
a mile away.

736
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:27,879
Mr. Mabry ain't never gonna know
who shot him dead.

737
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:53,471
Hey, Doc. That sun feels good, huh?
Good on the old bones?

738
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:57,306
It feels good to be warm,
I can tell you that.

739
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:01,146
Lorna! No more snow. We're almost there.

740
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:04,584
- How about Indians?
- No more Indians.

741
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:11,419
Thank you, Mabry.

742
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:14,055
The pleasure's mine, ma'am.

743
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:17,226
Here, Della, let me help you.

744
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:20,427
You know what?
You're as pretty as the morning.

745
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,031
Thank you, Mr. Healy.

746
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:27,099
- Aren't you old enough to call me Tom?
- Why, yes, Tom.

747
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:33,376
- You've done it again, Tom.
- Yes, Angie, we've done it again.

748
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:36,680
- If that mission's where you say it is.
- Maps don't lie, Mabry.

749
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,017
Yeah, but people do.
And they make the maps.

750
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:41,648
You'd better start brushing up
on your lines, Angie.

751
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:44,557
We'll be on the stage before you know it.
Come on.

752
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:49,163
Would you get me some water, Angie?
I'm all dried out.

753
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:51,496
I'll bring you some champagne.

754
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:59,737
- I'd be privileged to help you with that.
- Tom will help me. Tom?

755
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:02,801
- You scared to go down with me?
- I'm frightened only of Indians.

756
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:06,280
There ain't no Indians around here,
I told you that.

757
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:09,147
- You scared I might collect my bet?
- What bet?

758
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:10,742
What are you talking about?

759
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:14,415
- I played poker with him and lost.
- When did you play poker with him?

760
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:16,856
I'll tell you later.
Right now, we are in danger.

761
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:19,690
- Ain't no danger here.
- You stay out of this, Mabry.

762
01:03:19,762 --> 01:03:23,254
- You'll get your money.
- It ain't money that she lost.

763
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:27,068
What did you lose?

764
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:31,333
- Tom, we are in a country of wild...
- What did you bet that you lost?

765
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:35,040
Myself.

766
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:38,145
But I had four sevens.

767
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,314
Tom, I would have told you.

768
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:50,222
- How much was in the pot?
- $800, $900.

769
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:54,695
Against her?

770
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:58,661
- Well, you got her cheap.
- Tom.

771
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:01,861
What do you want me to do, win you back?

772
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,866
I'm a very poor poker player.

773
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:07,774
- It was only a game with...
- I'm too old for games.

774
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:19,353
He'll get over it. He always does.

775
01:05:20,483 --> 01:05:23,384
Is it time, Mabry? Have you stopped waiting?

776
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:27,585
You look so sure of yourself.

777
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:29,917
Why?

778
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:34,856
Because you know what I am.
You do, don't you? Better than he does.

779
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:37,490
And I know you.

780
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:41,635
We're alike, the two of us.
All we care about is what we want.

781
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,702
They could have found us.

782
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:32,616
Drop it!

783
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:44,496
You thought it was me.
Why? Why are you doing this?

784
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:47,125
Who sent you, Gallagher?

785
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:53,499
Who sent you? You wouldn't have
tried this yourself, not on me.

786
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:56,977
- Who's paying you?
- Nobody!

787
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:59,340
Well, who are they after? De Leon?

788
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:03,012
They're trying to get me
so they can get to him?

789
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:09,490
Who's dumb enough?
Who thinks they could take us?

790
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:12,391
Mabry, I'll help you. Stay out of Bonanza.

791
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:14,554
- I'm taking you there.
- No!

792
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,501
- Tom, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

793
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:23,402
When I saw you falling on the ground,
I thought you...

794
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:24,962
It's nothing.

795
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:29,537
But you are hurt. Let me help you.

796
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,304
I can take care of it.

797
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:33,815
Who's paying you?

798
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:37,946
Mabry, I'll help you.

799
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:44,993
Who sent you?

800
01:07:47,163 --> 01:07:49,324
De Leon sent me to kill you.

801
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:53,467
- You're not getting off that easy.
- I'm telling you.

802
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:55,731
I did a job for him and I'm gonna collect.

803
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:58,672
You'll never collect. He owes you too much.

804
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:02,802
He don't wanna pay you, Mabry.
You know what he's like.

805
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:05,905
I'm telling you the truth.

806
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:12,177
Get out of here.

807
01:08:13,322 --> 01:08:14,880
You mean that?

808
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:16,617
But not back to Bonanza.

809
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:20,526
I can't go back, Mabry, after missing you.
He'd string me up.

810
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:23,326
I don't want him to know you missed me.

811
01:08:30,339 --> 01:08:34,639
If he's hurt bad, you better get him
to the mission. It's just over the hill.

812
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:40,240
Over the hill? We're saved.

813
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:42,940
Tom, we're saved.

814
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:50,583
Mabry. Here.

815
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:54,285
I wouldn't know how to use it anyway.

816
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:51,543
Get the agent.

817
01:09:57,826 --> 01:09:59,760
My name is Healy, sir...

818
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:02,797
manager of the Healy Dramatic
and Concert Company.

819
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,459
We've had a bit of a hard going,
as you can see.

820
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:08,935
If you'd be kind enough
to assist the ladies...

821
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:13,335
He's dead. I know it, he's dead.

822
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:15,741
Put him on the bed in my office.

823
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:18,677
Easy, boys. He's hit in the leg.

824
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:33,052
Would you like me to get you something?
Some water, something to eat?

825
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:34,595
No, thank you.

826
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:37,763
You slept a long time, you were so tired.

827
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:41,695
- You feeling better?
- Fine.

828
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:45,896
The doctor said you would be
walking around in a week.

829
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:51,179
- You all comfortable where they've put you?
- Yes, I'm fine.

830
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:55,684
Better than sleeping out on those rocks,
or all cramped up in that wagon.

831
01:10:56,919 --> 01:11:00,355
- Not better than the wagon.
- The wagon wasn't much.

832
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:03,758
Every time it rained, we all went swimming.

833
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:08,757
To tell you the truth,
when I saw them burning...

834
01:11:10,566 --> 01:11:12,158
I was relieved.

835
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:19,874
I've been talking to the agent.
He's going to buy the horses.

836
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,578
You're breaking up the company?

837
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:31,513
It wasn't much of a company.

838
01:11:32,154 --> 01:11:36,557
Kind of foolish,
when you come right down to it.

839
01:11:36,892 --> 01:11:41,488
- Tom, listen to me. I'm sorry l...
- There's nothing to be sorry about.

840
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:44,293
- I wish l...
- There's nothing to wish for.

841
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:47,802
"Everything happens for the best,"
that's my new motto.

842
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:53,174
We weren't getting anywhere. We were
just wasting time. It's good we found it out.

843
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:56,808
Saves everybody a lot of time.

844
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:01,541
After a while,
time is the most important thing.

845
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:04,609
- Oh, Tom, you...
- Angie, there's nothing to say.

846
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:09,122
- Oh, he means nothing.
- No lies.

847
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:11,523
No more lies.

848
01:12:11,627 --> 01:12:15,290
It's easy for you to say that
because it's easy for you to tell the truth.

849
01:12:15,364 --> 01:12:17,628
It has never been easy for me.

850
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:21,561
What you want to do, you do.

851
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:26,136
I want to tell you the truth.

852
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:30,276
I don't think you know
what the truth is anymore.

853
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:32,371
I want to...

854
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:35,506
That's what the truth is to you:

855
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:37,308
What you want.

856
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:45,658
You tell the Doc where you're going to be.

857
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:49,793
When we sell the horses,
I'll send you your share.

858
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:23,061
What are you gonna do now?

859
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:26,065
What I've always done:
Get a job somewhere.

860
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,999
What you need is a stake, not just a job.

861
01:13:29,104 --> 01:13:32,562
Enough to get you to San Francisco,
get you some pretty clothes.

862
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:34,666
I know where you can get that stake.

863
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:37,007
Is there someone even you can't kill?

864
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:39,671
You got no call talking to me like that.

865
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:42,615
If I didn't kill some of them Indians,
you wouldn't be here.

866
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:46,142
I'm sorry. You're right, Mabry.
You did so much for us.

867
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:49,950
Then don't go treating me like dirt.
You ain't no better than me.

868
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:52,322
I'm worse, Mabry. Much worse.

869
01:13:53,629 --> 01:13:57,565
What do I do to get this,
what did you call it, stake?

870
01:13:57,633 --> 01:14:00,761
There's a fellow named De Leon
who owes me $5,000.

871
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:02,837
For killing those men in Cheyenne?

872
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:06,602
Yeah, he wanted them killed,
and he was paying good for it.

873
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:09,940
Now he wants you killed,
so he won't have to pay you.

874
01:14:10,212 --> 01:14:11,372
That's right.

875
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:14,814
I must admit, it's a way to save money.

876
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:18,145
I want you to get that $5,000 for me.

877
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:20,486
With a gun?

878
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:23,420
No, with a note from me,
telling him to give it to you.

879
01:14:23,492 --> 01:14:26,655
Sure, and he will give it to me just like that?

880
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:29,959
He's what they call a respectable man,
Mr. De Leon.

881
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:35,032
They'd run him out of town if they knew
he was going around having people killed.

882
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:37,128
They might even hang him.

883
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:41,901
With what I know on him,
he'll give you that money.

884
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:44,309
And then?

885
01:14:45,047 --> 01:14:47,515
- Then he'll have you trailed.
- To you.

886
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:49,546
But you ain't coming to me.

887
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:53,384
You're staying right there in Bonanza.
I'm coming to you.

888
01:14:54,556 --> 01:14:55,682
When?

889
01:14:56,725 --> 01:14:59,592
I don't know when, but you'll hear from me.

890
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:02,493
There's $500 of it for you.

891
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:04,628
Just for holding it?

892
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:06,934
Just for you.

893
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,536
You said you would give me a note.

894
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:18,341
Yeah. I ain't got such a good hand.
Think you could write it out for me?

895
01:15:18,413 --> 01:15:21,211
I mean I can't write it out so good.

896
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:25,610
No, sir, I can't write at all.

897
01:15:26,755 --> 01:15:29,280
I can't read and I can't write none.

898
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:32,122
But that don't mean I'm dirt.

899
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:37,259
You are not dirt.

900
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:48,968
Maybe with all that money,
we could go to San Francisco. On a train.

901
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:52,876
We'd have a high old time
with all that money.

902
01:15:55,517 --> 01:15:57,314
What shall I write?

903
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:04,058
We'll be in Bonanza in a couple of weeks.
Will you be there?

904
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:06,594
He's finished with me at last.

905
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:09,654
He'll get over it. I've lived long enough
to know that much.

906
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:12,427
Whatever it is, they always get over it.

907
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:14,469
You wait for me till I get in Bonanza.

908
01:16:14,536 --> 01:16:17,630
We'll persuade the natives there
to part with some of their gold.

909
01:16:17,706 --> 01:16:21,472
And what a time we'll have,
just you and me. Champagne all around.

910
01:16:21,543 --> 01:16:23,602
You take care of yourself.

911
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:27,540
- I'll miss you.
- I'll miss you, too, Angie.

912
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:35,282
- You'll be hearing from me.
- I'll be there.

913
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:37,587
You be careful. Real careful.

914
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,287
De Leon ain't no Sam Pierce.

915
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:45,163
- He'd just as soon kill you as look at you.
- Not the way he'll look at me.

916
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:46,666
Come on, go!

917
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:15,593
Come in.

918
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:24,771
I brought you some hot soup, Tom.

919
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:26,438
Thank you.

920
01:17:26,908 --> 01:17:29,775
You must get your strength back, you know.

921
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:33,472
- Why?
- Oh, you!

922
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:36,985
Let me do that.

923
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:39,987
You're still too weak, you'll cut yourself.

924
01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:43,781
- Have you ever used one of those before?
- No, but I'll learn.

925
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:45,850
I'm a very fast learner.

926
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:50,526
Do you know I learned the whole part
of Mazeppa in just one week?

927
01:17:50,966 --> 01:17:52,490
- You did?
- Yes.

928
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:57,464
And La Belle Hélène.
I learned all of Hélène in no time at all.

929
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:01,599
You learned those parts?

930
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:05,479
In case of emergency.

931
01:18:05,947 --> 01:18:08,142
I knew how unreliable she was.

932
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:11,150
Let's be fair, Della.
She never missed a performance.

933
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:13,687
But the way she played them.

934
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:16,689
I mean, there was simply no excuse for it...

935
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:19,283
playing opposite an actor like you.

936
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:24,661
I've had a lot of experience.

937
01:18:26,735 --> 01:18:30,569
I'd give anything to play
opposite an actor like you.

938
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:37,473
You know, Della,
you've changed in the last few weeks.

939
01:18:40,015 --> 01:18:42,040
You've kind of grown up.

940
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:48,251
Of course, you are a little young
for those parts, but maybe...

941
01:18:48,323 --> 01:18:50,814
I'm not as young as Mama says I am.

942
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:55,830
Or as you think I am, Tom.

943
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:00,598
I'm 20 years old.

944
01:19:04,206 --> 01:19:05,537
I'm 43.

945
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:09,641
- Oh, you don't look it.
- Well, I feel it.

946
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:13,472
Look, Della, thank you for the soup
and the close shave.

947
01:19:13,882 --> 01:19:16,851
Somebody has to play those parts,
and she's not here.

948
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:21,514
Della, there are no parts, there are no plays
and there's no Healy Company.

949
01:19:40,842 --> 01:19:43,777
Hotel's right over there, ma'am.
Nice clean rooms.

950
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:47,942
Thank you.

951
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:11,466
I'm just in, and I'd like to have
something very, very pretty.

952
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:18,008
No need to explain, dearie. You need
a dress, we'll see that you get one.

953
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:19,671
Here they are.

954
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:22,444
Come in the parlor
and we'll get you all fitted up.

955
01:20:22,517 --> 01:20:26,044
Take your spoon out of your cup
while you drink, Gladys.

956
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:31,955
- What'd you say you were, dearie?
- An actress.

957
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:34,222
Yeah. We're all actresses, ain't we?

958
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:39,731
I loan this tête-à-tête chair to
the opera house every time there's a show.

959
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:41,831
What a lovely room.

960
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:43,937
I try to keep it homey.

961
01:20:44,139 --> 01:20:46,403
Let's see. No, that's too big.

962
01:20:47,108 --> 01:20:48,803
That's no good.

963
01:20:49,611 --> 01:20:51,602
Oh, this is a nice one.

964
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,813
I think a tuck here and there...
Get me my sewing basket, Edna.

965
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:58,079
- Yes, ma'am.
- This is a beautiful dress.

966
01:20:58,153 --> 01:21:02,613
I made this dress for a dear, sweet girl.
Passed away from the pneumonia.

967
01:21:02,924 --> 01:21:05,188
Never did know her right name.

968
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:07,256
And she said to me...

969
01:21:07,395 --> 01:21:09,590
Her very last words, she said:

970
01:21:09,664 --> 01:21:12,462
"Mrs. Haddock, when I'm gone...

971
01:21:12,767 --> 01:21:16,134
"give this dress to one of the other girls,
you hear?"

972
01:21:16,438 --> 01:21:18,099
She was Southern, poor child.

973
01:21:18,173 --> 01:21:21,836
And you're the first girl that's come along
that was the right size.

974
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:24,105
I won't be able to pay you right away, but...

975
01:21:24,179 --> 01:21:28,343
Don't worry about that. Just make
some man pay, that's all I ask.

976
01:21:29,117 --> 01:21:33,451
For this purpose, a furnace was added
with a capacity of 30 tons a day...

977
01:21:33,521 --> 01:21:37,389
using two blowers, one crusher,
and a steam engine of 40 horsepower.

978
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:40,656
Additional profit from this operation
is expected to approach...

979
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:43,061
20% of the total investment.

980
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:47,525
It is also recommended that
the shipment of ore, coke, and bullion...

981
01:21:47,602 --> 01:21:51,129
be entirely taken over
by the De Leon Transport Company...

982
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:55,006
since this will ensure a marked saving
in the transportation costs.

983
01:21:55,176 --> 01:21:56,700
- In my office.
- Yes, sir.

984
01:21:56,778 --> 01:21:59,941
The advantages are economic,
and not without savings to the company.

985
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:03,917
Gentlemen. We'll have to continue
the meeting some other time, I'm sorry.

986
01:22:03,985 --> 01:22:06,010
- Perfectly all right.
- An important matter.

987
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:08,715
I must give it my immediate attention.

988
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:11,650
- My apologies, Mayor.
- Goodbye.

989
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:35,907
- How do I know this is true?
- You don't.

990
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:42,650
You've seen Mabry? He's alive?

991
01:22:43,024 --> 01:22:45,822
That man you sent,
what was his name, Gallagher?

992
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:49,829
It's a pity, a young man like that
to have such bad eyesight.

993
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:53,328
- Who are you?
- Does it matter?

994
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:57,633
Is this your family?
How sweet. The boys look just like you.

995
01:22:57,706 --> 01:23:00,004
I could have you arrested, you know.

996
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:03,374
Thrown into jail for trying to blackmail me.
That's a serious crime.

997
01:23:03,445 --> 01:23:07,939
So is murder.
In some places, even more serious.

998
01:23:08,216 --> 01:23:10,582
That depends
on who the murderer is, Miss...

999
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:13,883
Rossini.
May I have the money, Mr. De Leon?

1000
01:23:14,689 --> 01:23:16,680
You are very sure I'll give it to you.

1001
01:23:16,758 --> 01:23:19,886
Mabry said you were a clever man.
And a rich one.

1002
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:24,227
For a clever and rich man to save $5,000
and lose everything...

1003
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:27,932
it's, how do you say, a false saving?

1004
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:31,903
- You, too, are clever.
- Yeah. But not rich.

1005
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:33,600
- You could be.
- Yes, I know.

1006
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:37,270
All I would have to do is tell you
where Mabry is and what he plans to do.

1007
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:39,040
He'll never be missed.

1008
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:43,210
And whatever he's offered you,
I can offer a girl like you more.

1009
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:47,449
- Much more.
- But you don't know the kind of girl I am.

1010
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:50,320
But what does a girl like you want,
Miss Rossini?

1011
01:23:50,392 --> 01:23:53,156
Money. Mabry's money.

1012
01:23:53,995 --> 01:23:56,828
You see, you don't know the kind I am.

1013
01:23:56,898 --> 01:23:59,731
You think I'm clever, but I'm really not.

1014
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:02,299
The money, Mr. De Leon, please.

1015
01:24:04,272 --> 01:24:06,934
- It's in the other office.
- I'll wait.

1016
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:18,747
Goober.

1017
01:24:20,588 --> 01:24:23,716
There's a girl in my office.
She'll be leaving in a few minutes.

1018
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:28,286
Get downstairs with Joe and follow her.
Don't let her out of your sight.

1019
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:30,627
- Just watch her, that's all?
- That's enough.

1020
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:33,166
- She's going to meet Mabry.
- Mabry?

1021
01:24:33,301 --> 01:24:36,759
- I thought he was...
- Just do as I tell you. Now, go on.

1022
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:45,136
Thank you.

1023
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:48,782
- Aren't you going to count it?
- We trust you, Mr. De Leon.

1024
01:24:49,551 --> 01:24:52,418
How did Mabry ever find someone like you?

1025
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:55,652
It must have been his lucky day. Bye.

1026
01:25:45,006 --> 01:25:48,772
- Don't forget your curlers, baby.
- I won't be needing them anymore, Mama.

1027
01:25:48,843 --> 01:25:51,403
But, baby,
we're going to be among people again.

1028
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:55,472
- I like my hair this way.
- Baby, it makes you look so old.

1029
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:57,711
Call me Della, Mama,
that's what you named me.

1030
01:25:57,785 --> 01:26:01,084
I'm 20 years old.
Next month I'm going to be 21.

1031
01:26:02,357 --> 01:26:04,552
The end of next month.

1032
01:26:06,394 --> 01:26:08,862
- Goodbye, pop.
- The wagon's ready, Doc.

1033
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:11,655
Goodbye. And thanks for everything.

1034
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:14,361
Well, Mabry, I...

1035
01:26:15,236 --> 01:26:18,205
If you ever want to see a show, look us up.

1036
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:22,466
Whatever else happened,
you did save our lives.

1037
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:24,076
I want to thank you for that.

1038
01:26:24,145 --> 01:26:27,842
Maybe sometime I'll be in your neck
of the woods, and you can save my life.

1039
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:30,009
You know, I probably would.

1040
01:26:34,622 --> 01:26:36,522
Well, folks, we're here.

1041
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:39,754
Doc, you'll have your drink in a few minutes.

1042
01:26:46,501 --> 01:26:49,334
Driver! Stop!

1043
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:53,532
Tom, look.

1044
01:26:57,245 --> 01:26:59,679
Well, I've got to give her credit.

1045
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:03,984
- Don't be so quick about it.
- She got you a theater, Snoogie.

1046
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:06,953
Come, Lorna, I'm not the only Healy.
It's a common name.

1047
01:27:07,021 --> 01:27:09,649
- Let's go inside, Mama.
- Yes, Della.

1048
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:21,199
No, that doesn't work.

1049
01:27:21,469 --> 01:27:23,437
Let's try something else.

1050
01:27:23,504 --> 01:27:27,440
Here. This carpet. Just put it on.

1051
01:27:30,678 --> 01:27:34,808
Let's get ready.
Come on, let's start with the first act.

1052
01:27:34,882 --> 01:27:39,182
You in the middle, over here.
Where's the other boy? Come on. There.

1053
01:27:39,887 --> 01:27:40,979
All right.

1054
01:27:41,055 --> 01:27:44,218
"My pretty girl has left her nest
so early this morning."

1055
01:27:45,693 --> 01:27:49,254
- Angela.
- It sure is good to see you again, Angie.

1056
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:52,265
I didn't think we'd ever see you.

1057
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:54,795
You naughty thing, you.

1058
01:27:56,738 --> 01:27:58,797
Now, where are the dressing rooms?

1059
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:02,104
- Just back there. You'll find it.
- Thank you.

1060
01:28:16,591 --> 01:28:19,856
- Where'd you get the money?
- I stole it from Mabry.

1061
01:28:20,094 --> 01:28:22,528
Does he know it yet?

1062
01:28:23,665 --> 01:28:27,726
There is nothing he can do.
It's your theater, in your name.

1063
01:28:29,437 --> 01:28:33,237
Did you think you could just give me this
and I would take it?

1064
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:35,503
Even the way you think...

1065
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:38,170
did you really think I would take it?

1066
01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:44,209
Not really. I just hoped.

1067
01:28:44,285 --> 01:28:47,982
I wanted to do something for you.
Something nice.

1068
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:52,049
So you...
I don't know, you could think of me as...

1069
01:28:52,694 --> 01:28:53,991
You see?

1070
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:58,265
I only think of myself.
You're lucky to be rid of me.

1071
01:28:58,966 --> 01:29:03,130
But the theater is yours,
and I'll go whenever you want me to.

1072
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:09,174
- What are you rehearsing? Is that Mazeppa?
- Yeah.

1073
01:29:09,577 --> 01:29:10,874
It's staged all wrong.

1074
01:29:10,945 --> 01:29:14,506
Everything is wrong. I'm trying
to make costumes from I don't know what...

1075
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:16,709
old rags and carpets.

1076
01:29:16,784 --> 01:29:18,718
And these people have no experience.

1077
01:29:18,786 --> 01:29:21,949
They can't act
and I don't know how to tell them.

1078
01:29:23,024 --> 01:29:25,219
The horses didn't bring
as much as I'd hoped.

1079
01:29:25,293 --> 01:29:26,658
I don't want anything.

1080
01:29:26,728 --> 01:29:30,391
Doc and the girls can't go
to San Francisco without a new wardrobe.

1081
01:29:30,665 --> 01:29:33,600
No manager would look at them,
you know that.

1082
01:29:34,736 --> 01:29:37,466
I'll stage Mazeppa for you and play it...

1083
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:40,701
until I can make enough money
to pay back what I owe.

1084
01:29:41,242 --> 01:29:44,575
- You can play your part, if you like.
- I'd like to.

1085
01:29:45,079 --> 01:29:49,038
- That's the only reason I'm staying.
- I understand. I know.

1086
01:29:51,152 --> 01:29:55,145
Everybody take your places. We'll pick up
the rehearsal where we left off.

1087
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:59,749
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mr. Healy.

1088
01:30:01,362 --> 01:30:03,330
"Why, how is it my pretty bird..."

1089
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:06,026
"Has left her nest so early this morning?"

1090
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:07,192
Ladies.

1091
01:30:07,268 --> 01:30:10,431
"Those downcast eyes
and colorless cheeks assure me...

1092
01:30:10,505 --> 01:30:12,700
"she has passed a sleepless night."

1093
01:30:13,141 --> 01:30:16,304
- "I am deeply to be pitied."
- "Pitied?"

1094
01:30:17,812 --> 01:30:21,373
"You to be pitied?
When there's news of nothing else..."

1095
01:30:22,784 --> 01:30:25,218
...throughout the castle except the news
of your approaching marriage...

1096
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:27,686
to the young nobleman so rich, so elegant.

1097
01:30:27,755 --> 01:30:30,121
Those nuptials can never take place.

1098
01:30:30,491 --> 01:30:33,983
My heart, my soul,
each energy of my existence...

1099
01:30:34,228 --> 01:30:37,163
all is Casimir's.

1100
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:41,967
Casimir's! Heavens! That friendless youth.

1101
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:09,591
Someone approaches. 'Tis he. 'Tis Casimir.

1102
01:31:10,164 --> 01:31:12,632
Good heavens, how agitated.

1103
01:31:13,501 --> 01:31:15,196
Noble lady.

1104
01:31:16,204 --> 01:31:20,538
Oh, speak without reserve, Casimir.
My second mother here knows all.

1105
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:24,077
Before her, then, pronounce my fate.

1106
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:26,113
- Oh, your fate.
- Yes.

1107
01:31:26,447 --> 01:31:30,406
On you and on this moment,
depend the destinies of my life.

1108
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:34,182
Like the show?
It's too bad you can't see the rest of it.

1109
01:31:34,255 --> 01:31:36,189
Gets mighty exciting later on.

1110
01:32:08,155 --> 01:32:10,316
Adieu, my love.

1111
01:32:13,094 --> 01:32:15,426
- Hello.
- I ain't got much time.

1112
01:32:15,496 --> 01:32:18,932
Old De Leon's got his boys watching
this place. Did you get that money?

1113
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,662
- You're a real gooder.
- I have something to tell you.

1114
01:32:21,736 --> 01:32:24,933
- Just tell me where that money is.
- I spent it.

1115
01:32:25,006 --> 01:32:26,268
Hello, Mabry.

1116
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:29,901
How many times do I have to tell you
not to move on my lines?

1117
01:32:29,977 --> 01:32:33,913
- But you always told me...
- On other actors', Della, not on Mother's.

1118
01:32:34,782 --> 01:32:39,276
Listen, I was lucky to get it. Everyone said
it's worth much more than $5,000.

1119
01:32:39,353 --> 01:32:40,980
And I'll pay you back every cent.

1120
01:32:41,055 --> 01:32:43,615
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm going onstage.

1121
01:32:43,691 --> 01:32:45,955
- You ain't going nowhere.
- What do you mean?

1122
01:32:46,027 --> 01:32:48,222
What are you standing around for?
You're on next.

1123
01:32:48,296 --> 01:32:49,820
You stay out of this, Healy.

1124
01:32:49,897 --> 01:32:51,990
Keep your business with him
out of the theater.

1125
01:32:52,066 --> 01:32:54,500
- Go play your part.
- I said stay out of it.

1126
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:58,300
When my cue comes, I will be onstage.
And we'll talk after the show.

1127
01:32:58,372 --> 01:33:00,840
You and me'll talk right now.

1128
01:33:00,942 --> 01:33:03,638
You trying to make a fool out of me.
I don't like that.

1129
01:33:03,711 --> 01:33:04,973
I'm only trying to explain.

1130
01:33:05,046 --> 01:33:07,640
- There's your cue. Go on.
- Don't give me no trouble.

1131
01:33:07,715 --> 01:33:09,546
You come on over here. I wanna talk.

1132
01:33:09,617 --> 01:33:12,142
You let her go. She has to go on the stage.

1133
01:33:12,653 --> 01:33:15,622
Mabry. Please don't.

1134
01:33:52,326 --> 01:33:56,524
These amateurs are the curse of my life.
You get on the stage. Run.

1135
01:33:59,467 --> 01:34:01,697
I'm gonna kill you, Healy.

1136
01:34:04,005 --> 01:34:05,302
I demand an...

1137
01:34:05,373 --> 01:34:08,604
I demand an explanation.
There's a man in our dressing room.

1138
01:34:08,676 --> 01:34:10,268
And he's drunk.

1139
01:34:12,279 --> 01:34:13,871
That your room?

1140
01:34:19,687 --> 01:34:21,518
Hold it, Joe.

1141
01:34:32,633 --> 01:34:34,498
They got any other ways in here?

1142
01:34:34,568 --> 01:34:36,195
- Who's after you?
- De Leon.

1143
01:34:36,270 --> 01:34:38,670
He missed me once,
but he'll make sure this time.

1144
01:34:38,739 --> 01:34:41,071
Lock the door
on the other side of the stage.

1145
01:34:41,142 --> 01:34:42,803
You come with me.

1146
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:52,418
Come here. Can you see them out there?

1147
01:34:52,687 --> 01:34:55,952
Count, with the utmost joy
I shall attend thee.

1148
01:34:56,023 --> 01:34:57,718
- They're out there.
- All right.

1149
01:34:57,792 --> 01:35:02,024
You stay here and don't try anything.
I don't want you spoiling my show.

1150
01:35:02,329 --> 01:35:05,787
My esteemed Count Castellan.

1151
01:35:05,866 --> 01:35:10,235
Only pressing matters of state could have
kept me from your presence.

1152
01:35:10,304 --> 01:35:13,068
It was my wish, my fair Olinska...

1153
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:16,769
to present to thee my homage,
but ancient custom does not permit...

1154
01:35:16,844 --> 01:35:20,075
a Palatine of Poland
to offer his vows in person...

1155
01:35:20,147 --> 01:35:22,172
till after a solemn ceremony.

1156
01:35:22,883 --> 01:35:25,943
The Countess's coronet must be presented
to the intended...

1157
01:35:26,020 --> 01:35:29,979
and she returns her ring in exchange.

1158
01:35:31,125 --> 01:35:34,652
From that moment,
she is his affianced bride.

1159
01:35:35,496 --> 01:35:39,990
My envoy this day will come
on this very important mission.

1160
01:35:41,368 --> 01:35:44,496
Good night, my sweet Olinska.

1161
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:47,465
- Who art thou?
- Thy rival.

1162
01:35:47,541 --> 01:35:49,372
Have at thee.

1163
01:35:57,618 --> 01:36:02,385
That is my assassin.

1164
01:36:04,859 --> 01:36:07,794
Remove the mantle that conceals the wretch.

1165
01:36:08,996 --> 01:36:13,399
- Healy.
- Take it easy. Just enjoy the show.

1166
01:36:14,935 --> 01:36:16,334
- Back, Olinska.
- No!

1167
01:36:16,403 --> 01:36:19,429
He shall suffer the punishments inflicted
on rebel slaves.

1168
01:36:19,507 --> 01:36:23,500
I'm getting out of here. You listen to me.
There's an old mine just north of town.

1169
01:36:23,577 --> 01:36:26,910
- I can wait there for you till morning.
- I can't get the money by then.

1170
01:36:26,981 --> 01:36:28,243
- Mabry.
- In a minute.

1171
01:36:28,315 --> 01:36:32,149
Look, you're in my neck of the woods.
You want me to save your life?

1172
01:36:32,219 --> 01:36:33,413
Then come on.

1173
01:36:34,088 --> 01:36:35,885
I'll be waiting for you.

1174
01:36:45,366 --> 01:36:47,834
Now, launch the traitor forth!

1175
01:37:02,383 --> 01:37:03,748
It's Mabry!

1176
01:37:11,759 --> 01:37:14,557
Well, he made it. He got a...

1177
01:37:26,807 --> 01:37:29,742
- Don't be too long, Mama.
- I won't, Della.

1178
01:37:30,444 --> 01:37:33,470
- Snoogie, come have supper with us.
- Later.

1179
01:37:34,348 --> 01:37:37,943
Snoogie, forget her or don't forget her,
but we can settle down now.

1180
01:37:38,018 --> 01:37:40,452
- We've got a theater.
- All right, come on, Mama.

1181
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:42,819
- Are you coming, Tom?
- I'll meet you later.

1182
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:44,152
Let's go, Mama.

1183
01:37:44,225 --> 01:37:47,160
You can't say we didn't open with a bang.

1184
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,380
I'm sorry I took so long.

1185
01:38:17,458 --> 01:38:21,724
First to find that silly man, and then
to get him to open that silly bank.

1186
01:38:22,596 --> 01:38:24,086
And that ride.

1187
01:38:24,465 --> 01:38:26,626
I thought I would never find Mabry.

1188
01:38:26,867 --> 01:38:30,598
But I had to give him back his $5,000.
He helped us so much.

1189
01:38:30,971 --> 01:38:33,531
I didn't want him to think
I would cheat him.

1190
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:36,266
You got $5,000?

1191
01:38:36,343 --> 01:38:39,938
- That was all I owed him.
- In the middle of the night?

1192
01:38:41,115 --> 01:38:43,549
Some things are easier to get at night.

1193
01:38:43,617 --> 01:38:46,484
And this time I could put up real security.

1194
01:38:48,455 --> 01:38:52,221
- What did you put up?
- The Healy Theater.

1195
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:56,051
The theater? This is in my name.

1196
01:38:56,263 --> 01:38:58,163
I signed your name.

1197
01:39:02,336 --> 01:39:05,305
Mrs. Thomas Healy.

1198
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:09,337
But the man said it was all right.

1199
01:39:09,810 --> 01:39:12,802
He thinks we'll be a big success in Bonanza.

1200
01:39:13,347 --> 01:39:16,316
Of course, we'll have to stay here for a...

1201
01:39:16,984 --> 01:39:18,212
I know.

1202
01:39:19,887 --> 01:39:21,912
I haven't been asked yet.

1203
01:39:27,394 --> 01:39:30,295
- I ask you, Angie.
- Thank you.

1204
01:39:46,347 --> 01:39:48,542
I have to put out the lights.

1205
01:39:49,450 --> 01:39:51,884
But it was wrong of you to hit Mabry.

1206
01:39:51,952 --> 01:39:54,921
- He hit me first.
- That's no excuse.

1207
01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:57,014
It's against your nature.

1208
01:39:57,891 --> 01:40:02,089
And I want a man of your nature, not his.

1209
01:40:06,567 --> 01:40:09,161
- Angie.
- Also, you are much stronger than he is.

1210
01:40:09,236 --> 01:40:11,534
You could have hurt him.
