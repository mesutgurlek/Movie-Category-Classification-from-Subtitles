1
00:00:12,498 --> 00:00:17,937
<b>THE OKLAHOMA KID</b>

2
00:00:18,905 --> 00:00:21,905
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

3
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,782
The gentlemen of the press, Mr.
President.

4
00:00:51,849 --> 00:00:53,517
Good. Let them come in.

5
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:56,319
President Cleveland will
receive you now, gentlemen.

6
00:00:58,288 --> 00:01:01,423
Gentlemen,
I'm at your service.

7
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,491
Mr. Cleveland, we'd like to
know what you're going to do

8
00:01:03,557 --> 00:01:05,092
about the Indian
appropriations bill.

9
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,327
During my previous
term in office,

10
00:01:07,394 --> 00:01:10,330
I was opposed of the opening
of any Oklahoma territory

11
00:01:10,396 --> 00:01:11,831
to white settlement

12
00:01:11,897 --> 00:01:15,333
because I felt the terms
were unfair to the Indians.

13
00:01:15,401 --> 00:01:17,836
The cherokee strip
contains 6 million acres

14
00:01:17,901 --> 00:01:20,838
of the finest
farming land in America.

15
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:23,073
It is our last
free frontier.

16
00:01:23,138 --> 00:01:26,675
It's 180 miles long
and 50 miles wide,

17
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:29,610
but both houses have
now approved the measure,

18
00:01:29,677 --> 00:01:33,346
and since I happen to believe
that the will of the people

19
00:01:33,414 --> 00:01:35,349
is properly expressed
through the congress,

20
00:01:35,415 --> 00:01:39,119
I will sign the bill, and I'm
issuing this proclamation.

21
00:02:02,836 --> 00:02:05,805
That's it, boys. They pay off
the injuns, and we move in!

22
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:30,622
Get that cherokee
silver, Joe. We're in.

23
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:32,090
Right.

24
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:48,035
Who'll sign
for this money?

25
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,503
I will.

26
00:03:05,782 --> 00:03:08,918
Hear that stuff clink
when they set it down?

27
00:03:08,983 --> 00:03:12,386
Yeah. I kind of
like that sound.

28
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:14,622
Good luck.

29
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:56,385
All right, throw down
those guns. Get 'em up.

30
00:03:56,452 --> 00:03:58,555
Now fork over
those moneybags.

31
00:04:09,427 --> 00:04:12,230
Unhook this lead horse.

32
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,903
All right. Come on.

33
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,938
Come on. Get up.

34
00:05:14,676 --> 00:05:16,712
Hey! Hey!

35
00:05:16,777 --> 00:05:19,079
Whip, it's a holdup!

36
00:05:59,842 --> 00:06:01,077
All right,
get cover, boys!

37
00:06:18,223 --> 00:06:20,491
Come here.

38
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,646
I've had time to survey
the whole cherokee strip,

39
00:06:51,714 --> 00:06:53,614
and as most of you know,

40
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:57,017
the section we've chosen
is perfect for a town site.

41
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:00,153
It's flat, and there's
plenty of water.

42
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,856
The Texas cattle trails
run down through here,

43
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:08,059
and the sante fe railroad can build
their line down here from Wichita.

44
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,960
And they will
build it, too.

45
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:13,229
We'll give them a decent town
and decent trade.

46
00:07:13,296 --> 00:07:17,967
All around are thousands of acres
of the richest land in Oklahoma,

47
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:21,536
and it'll all be peopled
by this time tomorrow...

48
00:07:21,602 --> 00:07:24,971
Folks that will need doctors,
lawyers, merchants.

49
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,706
It's a new start
for all of us,

50
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:30,140
but it's going to mean
a lot of hard work,

51
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:33,145
and it's going to mean sticking
together for the common good,

52
00:07:33,212 --> 00:07:37,313
and it's going to mean
getting there first tomorrow.

53
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:39,749
Now, there
may be some trouble

54
00:07:39,816 --> 00:07:42,250
because I've been watched
and trailed by men

55
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:45,386
who probably aim to beat us
to our town site,

56
00:07:45,453 --> 00:07:48,923
but they won't,
for when that shot is fired,

57
00:07:48,988 --> 00:07:51,859
my son and I,
with our fastest riders,

58
00:07:51,926 --> 00:07:54,860
will race across prairies
and stake a claim.

59
00:07:54,927 --> 00:07:57,861
The rest of you can follow
with wagons and camp equipment.

60
00:07:57,929 --> 00:07:59,297
Now, is that clear?

61
00:07:59,364 --> 00:08:00,697
Yeah.

62
00:08:00,764 --> 00:08:03,366
All right, then.
Good luck to everybody.

63
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:05,835
Let's take
a look at that map.

64
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:11,605
John, you know
I envy you.

65
00:08:11,672 --> 00:08:13,907
It's a great plan. I wish
I could be with you.

66
00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:15,775
You will be
later, judge.

67
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:17,276
Pop's counting
on you bringing law

68
00:08:17,342 --> 00:08:18,711
into this territory,
judge.

69
00:08:18,778 --> 00:08:20,212
That's going to
be some job,

70
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:23,213
judging from the scum of the
west I've seen drifting in here.

71
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,549
Won't be too big
a job for you, dad.

72
00:08:25,616 --> 00:08:28,551
You think one poor old judge can make
the whole robber's roost behave?

73
00:08:28,618 --> 00:08:30,052
If anybody can.

74
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,222
Seems I've raised
an optimist, ned.

75
00:08:32,287 --> 00:08:33,521
Come on, John.

76
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:38,725
There'll be a lot of changes
in our lives after tomorrow.

77
00:08:38,793 --> 00:08:41,226
First, you'll be riding
circuit with your father,

78
00:08:41,293 --> 00:08:44,230
and I'll be helping
to start a new town.

79
00:08:44,297 --> 00:08:45,730
Aren't you thrilled?

80
00:08:45,797 --> 00:08:48,731
I would be if it didn't
mean us being separated.

81
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,168
Tulsa will spring up
overnight, ned,

82
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:53,669
and we'll soon be settled there
with father holding court

83
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:55,671
and sending dangerous
outlaws to jail.

84
00:08:55,739 --> 00:08:57,106
I soon as I get there,

85
00:08:57,172 --> 00:09:00,108
I'm going to claim the most
beautiful spot of all for us.

86
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:02,510
Ned,
isn't it wonderful?

87
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,343
A whole new life
ahead of us,

88
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:05,844
a whole new city,

89
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:07,345
and soon
a new state,

90
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,215
and it all
begins tomorrow.

91
00:09:09,281 --> 00:09:12,516
Get your partners
for a dance!

92
00:09:13,617 --> 00:09:15,586
Ned, let's dance.

93
00:09:15,653 --> 00:09:17,888
One more couple
right over there.

94
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:19,322
That's it.

95
00:09:24,425 --> 00:09:26,761
Well, here we go!

96
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:32,865
Salute your partner.

97
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:37,335
Forward dance,
swing on the right.

98
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:40,839
Swing on the left.

99
00:09:42,238 --> 00:09:46,508
Hold the man proud and tall,
and swing him round.

100
00:09:52,446 --> 00:09:57,249
And forward and back,
swing on the right,

101
00:09:57,316 --> 00:09:58,751
now on the left.

102
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:02,386
First lady and last gent,
forward dance.

103
00:10:02,453 --> 00:10:04,588
Do-si-do.

104
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,697
The next lady and the last gent,
forward dance.

105
00:10:15,763 --> 00:10:17,865
Do-si-do.

106
00:10:22,968 --> 00:10:25,637
Now, then...

107
00:10:25,704 --> 00:10:30,406
All join hands
and circle to the center.

108
00:10:30,474 --> 00:10:33,809
Grab right, then left.

109
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:39,982
When you reach your partner,
everybody swing to the right.

110
00:10:41,982 --> 00:10:43,817
Now to the left.

111
00:10:48,488 --> 00:10:51,324
Have...Have you
seen who's here?

112
00:10:52,989 --> 00:10:57,693
Take her to your arms
and swing her all around.

113
00:10:57,761 --> 00:10:59,695
Who's the stranger
with Jane?

114
00:10:59,762 --> 00:11:01,096
I wouldn't know.

115
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:06,867
How'd we get
in here?

116
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,367
Well, I don't know.

117
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:10,870
Beautiful
night, isn't it?

118
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,037
Yes, it is.

119
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:15,039
Just feel that air.
Feel that air. Go on.

120
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,408
What?

121
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:21,012
Feel that air. It's
like velvet, isn't it?

122
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:23,145
What's the matter
with you?

123
00:11:23,212 --> 00:11:24,780
Can we go,
darling?

124
00:11:24,848 --> 00:11:27,783
So soon? Let's
stay a little longer.

125
00:11:27,849 --> 00:11:28,750
Hello, ned.

126
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:29,985
Surprised?

127
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,987
Hardly. I expected you to
show up sooner or later.

128
00:11:33,054 --> 00:11:34,487
You know each other?

129
00:11:34,554 --> 00:11:37,323
Yes, but ned's a very
funny kind of fellow.

130
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,823
Doesn't
like to admit it.

131
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,827
Your father's
waiting for us.

132
00:11:40,893 --> 00:11:43,994
Wait a minute. I haven't thanked
the lady for the dance.

133
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:45,495
Thank you, milady.

134
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:48,699
May I look forward to again being
favored next time we meet?

135
00:11:48,766 --> 00:11:50,133
You're a lunatic.

136
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:52,801
'S crazy.

137
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:54,902
Did ask you
to feel the air?

138
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,737
Why, yes. Who is?

139
00:11:56,803 --> 00:11:58,706
Someone I'd like
to forget.

140
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:02,575
But I told you, we ain't
got no rooms left.

141
00:12:02,642 --> 00:12:03,810
I didn't ask
you that.

142
00:12:03,874 --> 00:12:05,576
I asked you which was the
best room in the house.

143
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:09,314
Number 6, and there's about 18
boomers sleeping in it right now.

144
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,648
But that's our room.

145
00:12:10,714 --> 00:12:12,181
I told you we couldn't
hold nothing, miss.

146
00:12:12,249 --> 00:12:13,683
I told you, you had to
sit in it to keep it.

147
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,283
The town's overrun
with boomers,

148
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,686
and if you ain't there,
they are.

149
00:12:16,753 --> 00:12:18,187
What's this
about our room?

150
00:12:18,254 --> 00:12:19,687
I told you we couldn't
hold nothing.

151
00:12:19,753 --> 00:12:21,688
I'd be glad to let you
have my room, ma'am.

152
00:12:21,756 --> 00:12:23,190
Well, that's
very kind of you.

153
00:12:23,257 --> 00:12:25,358
Thank you, but
we couldn't put you out.

154
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:27,226
Wouldn't be
putting me out.

155
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:29,695
Just a minute. What room
do you think you have?

156
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:32,296
Number 6, and you're
very welcome to it.

157
00:12:32,364 --> 00:12:35,366
See here. I told you who
was in number 6...

158
00:12:35,432 --> 00:12:37,867
About 18 boomers sleeping
on the floor, 3 deep.

159
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:41,070
That's all right. They'd be
glad to do a favor for a lady.

160
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:42,704
That's awfully
generous of you,

161
00:12:42,771 --> 00:12:44,873
but I really don't
know how to thank you.

162
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:47,640
Not another word.
Just leave it to me.

163
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:51,144
Hey, what's
going on here?

164
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,154
Come on, you mavericks!
On your feet!

165
00:13:06,222 --> 00:13:07,289
The land rush is on!
Come on!

166
00:13:07,356 --> 00:13:08,691
They've fired
the starting gun! Come on!

167
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:18,376
'S taking me home
to his house.

168
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,416
The soldiers are all bunched
on the immigrant line,

169
00:14:29,483 --> 00:14:31,317
but on the other side
of the creek,

170
00:14:31,383 --> 00:14:34,319
they begin thinning out to
one soldier every 50 yards.

171
00:14:34,385 --> 00:14:35,353
Two.

172
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,854
We can slip through
there tonight

173
00:14:36,922 --> 00:14:38,823
and be on the inside,
waiting for them.

174
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:40,324
What about this
"sooner" law?

175
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,326
Once we've staked out a claim,
they can't prove a thing.

176
00:14:43,393 --> 00:14:45,328
Well, what are we
waiting for?

177
00:14:45,395 --> 00:14:49,097
We're waiting for the line to
thin out so we can slip through.

178
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,752
Bet $10.

179
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,287
That's brand-new
money.

180
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,788
Where'd you
get it, mister?

181
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,758
Minted it myself
this morning.

182
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:30,793
Well, aces always
beat kings.

183
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:33,397
Whip, I just seen
one of the fellas

184
00:15:33,463 --> 00:15:34,596
that took that
Indian money off us.

185
00:15:34,663 --> 00:15:35,731
Yeah? You sure?

186
00:15:35,798 --> 00:15:37,167
'S playing with a lot
of new-minted money.

187
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:46,405
Play that for me,
will you?

188
00:15:46,472 --> 00:15:47,373
Sure.

189
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,847
Where is?

190
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,582
That little fellow
over there with the piano.

191
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:02,351
<i>Say, do you know, I don't
want to play in your yard?</i>

192
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:03,851
They don't
want that tonight.

193
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,019
Play it.

194
00:16:05,086 --> 00:16:06,520
Not tonight,
brother.

195
00:16:06,587 --> 00:16:07,621
Play it.

196
00:16:07,688 --> 00:16:10,723
Sure, that's
one of my favorites.

197
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,358
Yeah, it would be. You
know who that is?

198
00:16:13,425 --> 00:16:14,359
No.

199
00:16:14,427 --> 00:16:17,961
That's
the Oklahoma kid.

200
00:16:18,028 --> 00:16:19,696
Handley.

201
00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:24,766
Tell that little squirt
over by the piano

202
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,834
I want to see him.

203
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,697
Put it away,
handley.

204
00:17:05,897 --> 00:17:08,398
Kid, I want
to talk to you.

205
00:17:08,466 --> 00:17:09,567
Keep on playing.

206
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:11,402
I said I want
to talk to you.

207
00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:12,869
Well, go ahead
and talk.

208
00:17:12,934 --> 00:17:14,369
My name's
whip mccord.

209
00:17:14,437 --> 00:17:16,338
That mean
anything to you?

210
00:17:16,404 --> 00:17:17,338
How's that?

211
00:17:17,406 --> 00:17:18,740
Mccord.

212
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:21,241
Mccord, mccord,
mccord....

213
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:23,444
I don't like it.
Do you?

214
00:17:27,445 --> 00:17:29,448
I want that
Indian money.

215
00:17:29,514 --> 00:17:31,049
Well, go and get it
from the Indians.

216
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:33,285
Kid, I'm giving you a break
'cause I'm pressed for time.

217
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:35,051
Don't you raise
that bottle at me!

218
00:17:35,118 --> 00:17:36,419
Give me
that bottle!

219
00:17:39,688 --> 00:17:41,357
Go on.
Get over there.

220
00:17:41,423 --> 00:17:42,958
Get over.

221
00:17:43,024 --> 00:17:44,960
That's a boy.

222
00:17:45,027 --> 00:17:46,960
Play, professor.

223
00:18:02,805 --> 00:18:04,906
Hi, sheriff. I'm
glad you got here.

224
00:18:04,974 --> 00:18:07,510
What's it about,
mccord?

225
00:18:07,576 --> 00:18:09,343
You looking for the man
that held up the stagecoach

226
00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:10,844
and got that
Indian money?

227
00:18:10,912 --> 00:18:12,846
Naturally. What's that
got to do with it?

228
00:18:12,913 --> 00:18:14,347
That's him
just left here.

229
00:18:14,414 --> 00:18:16,615
I called him on it,
and started shooting.

230
00:18:16,682 --> 00:18:18,116
How'd you know him?

231
00:18:18,183 --> 00:18:20,618
How else would a man
get new-minted money?

232
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,620
'S been spreading it
all around the joint.

233
00:18:22,688 --> 00:18:24,121
That's right.
We all seen him.

234
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:25,622
Who was?

235
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,056
The Oklahoma kid.

236
00:18:27,122 --> 00:18:28,057
The Oklahoma kid,

237
00:18:28,124 --> 00:18:29,058
yeah.

238
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,126
Let me take a look
at that silver.

239
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,159
I'll show you.

240
00:19:03,249 --> 00:19:04,851
Let's compare
watches, captain.

241
00:19:04,918 --> 00:19:05,852
Here's ned.

242
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:06,852
Hey there!

243
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:09,822
Well,
how are you, judge?

244
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:11,122
Get there first, ned.

245
00:19:11,189 --> 00:19:13,590
We will, and don't be too
long coming to our city.

246
00:19:13,657 --> 00:19:14,859
Get it built first.

247
00:19:14,926 --> 00:19:17,427
It's almost time to sound
the warning signal.

248
00:19:17,493 --> 00:19:18,728
Sound the attention.

249
00:19:22,498 --> 00:19:24,933
Good-bye, ned,
and good luck to you.

250
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:26,702
You're my good luck.

251
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:31,938
Bye!

252
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,406
Come on, ned.

253
00:19:43,412 --> 00:19:46,447
Starting gun goes off
in 5 minutes, boys.

254
00:20:03,028 --> 00:20:04,961
Wait a minute, pop.
Wait a minute.

255
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:06,463
What's your
best whiskey?

256
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:07,932
Kentucky bourbon,
11 years old.

257
00:20:09,531 --> 00:20:11,433
I'll try some of
your bar whiskey.

258
00:20:13,035 --> 00:20:14,468
Want to catch
that stampede?

259
00:20:14,536 --> 00:20:16,469
Go ahead.
I'll hold down the bar.

260
00:20:16,536 --> 00:20:18,939
Thanks. Have a drink
on the house.

261
00:20:20,806 --> 00:20:22,207
Squad, ready.

262
00:20:22,274 --> 00:20:24,110
Squad, fire!

263
00:21:23,952 --> 00:21:25,019
Hello, young fella.

264
00:21:25,086 --> 00:21:27,021
Never got to thank
you for the rooms.

265
00:21:27,088 --> 00:21:28,022
Don't mention it.

266
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:29,023
Where's
the bartender?

267
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,659
Outside watching
the rush, I suppose.

268
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:32,192
It was a great
sight, wasn't it?

269
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:33,794
I don't know.
I didn't see it.

270
00:21:33,861 --> 00:21:36,163
You didn't see it?

271
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:39,031
No. I thought I'd have me a
quiet little drink instead.

272
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:41,700
What'll you have? I'll serve
you. It's on the house.

273
00:21:41,765 --> 00:21:44,535
Here, try some of this
uncut moonshine.

274
00:21:44,601 --> 00:21:46,535
Got some taste to it.
Go ahead.

275
00:21:46,603 --> 00:21:47,737
Thanks.

276
00:21:47,803 --> 00:21:49,638
How come a strong, healthy
young fellow like you

277
00:21:49,705 --> 00:21:52,473
isn't out there up to his
neck in this land rush?

278
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,974
Why? I'm doing
all right.

279
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,476
Those people are going out
there to build a new empire.

280
00:21:56,544 --> 00:21:58,078
Fine.
Let them have it.

281
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,980
You mean to say you've got
no feeling for the country,

282
00:22:01,046 --> 00:22:04,483
no pride in seeing a civilization
carved out of a wilderness?

283
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:06,850
What sort of
an American are you?

284
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:08,486
I like
the country fine.

285
00:22:08,553 --> 00:22:10,987
As for civilization, I've got
nothing in particular against it.

286
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:12,888
I can take it
or leave it alone.

287
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,824
What sort of folks
did you come from?

288
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,493
The most god-fearing,
law-abiding,

289
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:19,993
land-grabbing, empire-building
fellas you ever saw.

290
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,996
Suckers for this land-rush
stuff, too, but not for me.

291
00:22:23,062 --> 00:22:26,098
I crave a nice easygoing
existence, and I've got it.

292
00:22:26,165 --> 00:22:30,001
I see. No responsibility.
No ambition.

293
00:22:30,068 --> 00:22:31,335
None of this get-up-
and-get-it stuff

294
00:22:31,403 --> 00:22:32,970
that regular
folks have.

295
00:22:33,037 --> 00:22:36,739
Exactly, and that's why my folks and
I have been on the outs for years.

296
00:22:36,806 --> 00:22:39,475
You seem like a very
antisocial young man.

297
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:42,476
But I'm not. I'm as
social as a setter pup.

298
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:43,978
I like all kinds
of people,

299
00:22:44,045 --> 00:22:45,479
but I don't take
to this itch

300
00:22:45,545 --> 00:22:47,214
for plowing up
new empires, that's all.

301
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:48,683
But why not?

302
00:22:48,748 --> 00:22:50,917
I'll tell you
why not.

303
00:22:50,984 --> 00:22:52,417
Now, look.

304
00:22:52,484 --> 00:22:55,753
In the first place...

305
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,422
The white people steal the
land from the Indians, right?

306
00:22:58,489 --> 00:22:59,690
They get paid
for it, don't they?

307
00:22:59,757 --> 00:23:01,025
Paid for it?
Yeah.

308
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:02,525
A measly
$1.40 an acre,

309
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:05,026
price agreed to
at the point of a gun.

310
00:23:05,094 --> 00:23:06,429
Then the immigrants
sweat and strain

311
00:23:06,495 --> 00:23:08,430
and break their hearts
carving out a civilization.

312
00:23:08,497 --> 00:23:09,931
Fine. Great.

313
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:12,431
Then when they get it
all pretty and prosperous,

314
00:23:12,498 --> 00:23:15,435
along come the grafters and
land-grabbers and politicians

315
00:23:15,501 --> 00:23:17,435
and with one hand
skim off the cream

316
00:23:17,503 --> 00:23:19,439
and with the other,
scoop up the gravy.

317
00:23:19,505 --> 00:23:20,938
Not for me. Listen.

318
00:23:21,005 --> 00:23:23,940
I learned this about human
nature when I was about so high,

319
00:23:24,006 --> 00:23:26,943
and that is that the strong
take away from the weak,

320
00:23:27,011 --> 00:23:28,978
and the smart take it
away from the strong.

321
00:23:29,044 --> 00:23:31,278
I suppose you never
heard of the law

322
00:23:31,346 --> 00:23:32,915
that protects people's
rights and property.

323
00:23:32,981 --> 00:23:36,450
Yeah, I've heard of it.
I've seen it work, too.

324
00:23:36,517 --> 00:23:37,951
Sometimes,
it's all right.

325
00:23:38,018 --> 00:23:39,952
In the cities,
maybe fine,

326
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:42,488
but here,
you can't trust it.

327
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:43,823
This is the only law
that I know

328
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,191
that's worth a hoot in
this part of the country.

329
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,690
The only law.

330
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,361
This is wasting time.
Come on. Let's have a drink.

331
00:23:54,196 --> 00:23:55,598
Hands up.

332
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,135
Hello, Abe.
Hello, Sam.

333
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,635
Howdy, judge.

334
00:24:02,703 --> 00:24:04,638
Will you kindly remove
those irons, please, sir?

335
00:24:04,705 --> 00:24:06,772
Why, certainly.

336
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,241
Excuse me, son.

337
00:24:08,308 --> 00:24:10,141
This young fellow
a friend of yours?

338
00:24:10,207 --> 00:24:12,642
Well, not exactly. We're just
having a drink together.

339
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,577
'S got some very original
ideas about life.

340
00:24:14,645 --> 00:24:15,847
I wouldn't wonder.

341
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,847
Just keep them up, son.
Don't start any trouble.

342
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,014
Well, what's up?

343
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,249
I'm Abe Collins.

344
00:24:20,315 --> 00:24:20,783
Who?

345
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:21,717
Abe Collins.

346
00:24:21,784 --> 00:24:22,485
Is?

347
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,684
Yes.
'S the sheriff.

348
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,487
Now, look here. You dropped
some new-minted money

349
00:24:25,553 --> 00:24:27,620
last night in a Blackjack
game, didn't you?

350
00:24:27,687 --> 00:24:29,022
That's right.
What of it?

351
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:32,024
Nothing, only it happens to be
part of that Indian consignment

352
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:33,559
stolen from the stage
yesterday evening.

353
00:24:33,626 --> 00:24:36,528
Well, it seems like law
won out, even out here.

354
00:24:36,593 --> 00:24:38,896
We've been waiting a long
time to pick up this boy.

355
00:24:38,963 --> 00:24:40,531
Is that so?

356
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:42,831
Well, 's
an amiable thief.

357
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,533
So pleasant about it all.
Who is?

358
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,235
We don't know his right name,
but throughout the territory,

359
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:49,471
's known as
the Oklahoma kid.

360
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:50,939
All right, kid.

361
00:24:56,608 --> 00:24:57,576
Good morning, ma'am.

362
00:24:57,642 --> 00:24:58,877
Good morning.

363
00:24:58,944 --> 00:25:00,212
Lovely morning.

364
00:25:14,688 --> 00:25:15,923
Father,
what's happened?

365
00:25:15,991 --> 00:25:18,126
Seems that our young friend
is the Oklahoma kid.

366
00:25:28,065 --> 00:25:30,034
Whip,
here they come.

367
00:25:36,004 --> 00:25:37,439
Sorry, gents.

368
00:25:37,506 --> 00:25:40,041
I'm afraid you're trespassing
on private property.

369
00:25:40,108 --> 00:25:41,442
Sooners?

370
00:25:41,508 --> 00:25:43,943
No. We just got here ahead
of you. That's all.

371
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,745
We led the field all the
way, nobody else in sight.

372
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:48,447
We'll have you sited
at the land office.

373
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:49,881
Now keep
your shirt on.

374
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,882
There's no sense
in starting any trouble

375
00:25:51,948 --> 00:25:54,384
when everything can be
settled quiet and peaceful.

376
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:55,352
The only way to
settle this

377
00:25:55,418 --> 00:25:56,853
is for you
to get off our land.

378
00:25:56,919 --> 00:25:58,354
Your land?
Here's our claim stake

379
00:25:58,421 --> 00:26:00,189
sticking right up here
in front of you.

380
00:26:00,255 --> 00:26:01,822
You won't get
away with this.

381
00:26:01,889 --> 00:26:03,324
I think we will.

382
00:26:03,391 --> 00:26:06,127
We've already got a man halfway
back to the claim office.

383
00:26:06,192 --> 00:26:09,496
You're licked, Mr.
Kincaid, and you know it.

384
00:26:09,563 --> 00:26:11,064
Hey, what are
you after?

385
00:26:11,131 --> 00:26:15,301
Nothing much. We just heard you were
figuring on building a town here.

386
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:17,300
That's all right with us.

387
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:19,304
All we want's
a part of it

388
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,371
and the exclusive rights
to any saloons

389
00:26:21,438 --> 00:26:23,373
or gambling houses
the town might need.

390
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:25,874
Who are you?
Where are you from?

391
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,375
Whip mccord
from the panhandle.

392
00:26:27,443 --> 00:26:28,876
What's
your proposition?

393
00:26:28,943 --> 00:26:32,012
You go right ahead and build
your town and attract settlers.

394
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:35,414
So you can take away their
money at faro and roulette?

395
00:26:35,482 --> 00:26:36,883
Yeah, that's the idea.

396
00:26:36,949 --> 00:26:38,885
You take care
of their virtues.

397
00:26:38,951 --> 00:26:40,385
I'll take
care of their vices.

398
00:26:40,452 --> 00:26:41,653
That's simple, ain't it?

399
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,254
We'll fight you through
the courts first.

400
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,889
You aren't going to do
yourself any good in court.

401
00:26:45,955 --> 00:26:47,889
You can't start building
until the title's cleared,

402
00:26:47,957 --> 00:26:50,792
and you know how long
that'll take.

403
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:54,294
Meanwhile, some other town
will be years ahead of you.

404
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:56,596
Anyway, why fight?

405
00:26:56,663 --> 00:26:58,630
What's a few hundred
foot of business frontage

406
00:26:58,697 --> 00:27:01,700
to an empire builder
like you, Mr. Kincaid?

407
00:27:05,703 --> 00:27:07,705
All right.
Pick out your ground.

408
00:27:09,205 --> 00:27:12,942
Right here, and here's a
waiver of right to protest

409
00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:13,976
under the sooner law,

410
00:27:14,042 --> 00:27:16,945
so that everything
will be fair and square.

411
00:29:32,377 --> 00:29:34,446
Hey!

412
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,454
All right, boys.
'S only a floater.

413
00:29:46,521 --> 00:29:47,922
Get on with your play.

414
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,729
Shootings, killings,
robberies,

415
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:01,732
and a mighty orgy of
drunkenness, gambling, and vice

416
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,901
all directly traceable
to mccord's influence.

417
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:07,670
Why, owns our mayor, our
sheriff, and half our deputies.

418
00:30:07,736 --> 00:30:09,405
Yes,
they make arrests,

419
00:30:09,471 --> 00:30:11,406
just enough to save
their faces,

420
00:30:11,473 --> 00:30:14,408
but we can't convict
because, despite my efforts,

421
00:30:14,474 --> 00:30:16,711
juries are bribed and
witnesses intimidated.

422
00:30:16,777 --> 00:30:19,246
I say we need
a showdown.

423
00:30:19,313 --> 00:30:20,913
Either mccord
and his crowd

424
00:30:20,979 --> 00:30:22,582
run this town
or we do.

425
00:30:22,647 --> 00:30:24,149
It's time
to find out.

426
00:30:25,315 --> 00:30:26,750
I know.

427
00:30:26,817 --> 00:30:28,751
I've been wondering how much
longer this could go on,

428
00:30:28,818 --> 00:30:30,920
but we made a mistake
in the first place

429
00:30:30,987 --> 00:30:32,688
in making a deal
with him.

430
00:30:32,755 --> 00:30:34,422
Now, what do you
suggest?

431
00:30:34,489 --> 00:30:37,092
I say we should form
a vigilance committee.

432
00:30:38,494 --> 00:30:41,995
No, no. That would only be
one mob fighting another.

433
00:30:42,062 --> 00:30:44,930
We represent
law and order.

434
00:30:44,998 --> 00:30:48,567
We've got to take control
away from mccord legally.

435
00:30:52,737 --> 00:30:56,373
We've seen these gamblers
and criminals make our city

436
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,675
the nesting place
for all the scum of the west.

437
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:02,843
We've seen vice
and corruption flourish

438
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:05,546
and our officials
do nothing about it.

439
00:31:09,115 --> 00:31:13,251
We've seen murders committed in
our streets and public places

440
00:31:13,318 --> 00:31:15,387
and the murderers
go unpunished.

441
00:31:15,454 --> 00:31:18,455
We can't tolerate
this condition any longer.

442
00:31:18,522 --> 00:31:22,892
It's up to you, men, as voters,
to stop this lawlessness.

443
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:25,393
I ask you to elect me mayor

444
00:31:25,461 --> 00:31:30,064
so I can clean out mccord and his
gang of thieves and murderers.

445
00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:33,066
I ask you to elect
my son sheriff.

446
00:31:36,035 --> 00:31:38,371
All right, boys,
break it up.

447
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,686
Mccord!

448
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,688
Breaking up
a few speeches

449
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:05,824
isn't going
to save you.

450
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,693
In the end, I'll see
that the law gets you,

451
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:11,728
and it won't be just to
run you out of town.

452
00:32:11,795 --> 00:32:13,997
It will be at the
end of a rope.

453
00:32:16,665 --> 00:32:19,534
We ought to do something
about Kincaid, whip.

454
00:32:19,601 --> 00:32:22,703
'S likely to get up the vigilantes
like they did in dodge city.

455
00:32:22,769 --> 00:32:24,036
We'll do
something.

456
00:32:24,103 --> 00:32:26,038
We'll get him on the
end of that rope,

457
00:32:26,104 --> 00:32:27,706
and it'll be
in his own

458
00:32:27,773 --> 00:32:29,407
law-and-order
fashion, too.

459
00:33:29,985 --> 00:33:31,219
What's the matter, Jose?

460
00:33:31,285 --> 00:33:32,120
You don't like music?

461
00:33:32,187 --> 00:33:34,155
You don't like
the music?

462
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:35,489
All right,
come on.

463
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,323
Come on over here
with me.

464
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,325
I'm going to sit
down here.

465
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,859
I'm going
to sing to you.

466
00:33:40,926 --> 00:33:42,528
Come on.
Ho ho ho.

467
00:33:43,928 --> 00:33:45,196
All right.

468
00:33:45,262 --> 00:33:46,598
You don't mind
if I sing, do you?

469
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:12,217
Hey, now.
Once again, now.

470
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,161
How's that? You like it?

471
00:34:29,228 --> 00:34:31,530
All right. Come on.
Everything's all right.

472
00:34:31,597 --> 00:34:34,832
Come on. We're going to get
a nice sleep?

473
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:36,833
We're going to get
a nice rest, aren't we?

474
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,168
That's a good boy.

475
00:34:40,736 --> 00:34:42,171
<i>Callate!</i>

476
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,340
Shut up.

477
00:34:48,176 --> 00:34:50,178
It's Pedro.
It's all right.

478
00:34:56,782 --> 00:34:58,217
You get everything,
Pedro?

479
00:34:58,284 --> 00:34:59,752
<i>- Si, senor.
- Everything.</i>

480
00:35:14,161 --> 00:35:15,462
<i>Here's the dinero,
senor.</i>

481
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:17,765
<i>Gracias, senor.</i>

482
00:35:39,047 --> 00:35:40,047
Pedro...

483
00:35:40,113 --> 00:35:41,481
Pedro, saddle
my horse.

484
00:35:41,549 --> 00:35:42,617
<i>Si, senor.</i>

485
00:35:44,884 --> 00:35:46,152
You go?

486
00:35:46,219 --> 00:35:47,319
<i>Si, manuelita.</i>

487
00:35:47,386 --> 00:35:48,587
You no stay
for dinner?

488
00:35:48,652 --> 00:35:49,754
<i>No, gracias.</i>

489
00:35:49,821 --> 00:35:51,588
You come back soon?

490
00:35:51,655 --> 00:35:53,090
Yes, very soon.

491
00:35:53,157 --> 00:35:56,125
Manuelita, take care of these
things for me, will you?

492
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:06,800
Adios.

493
00:36:06,867 --> 00:36:07,935
- Adios.
- Adios.

494
00:36:32,586 --> 00:36:35,421
Morning, friend. Where's the
jailhouse in this town?

495
00:36:35,488 --> 00:36:36,789
Right up the street.
You can't miss it.

496
00:36:36,855 --> 00:36:38,189
Glad to hear that.

497
00:36:38,257 --> 00:36:39,924
How's that?

498
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,559
Is that where they're
keeping old man Kincaid?

499
00:36:41,626 --> 00:36:43,592
Yep, smack-dab in the
front cell upstairs

500
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,228
where folks
can stare at him.

501
00:36:45,295 --> 00:36:46,096
All right. Thanks.

502
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:47,164
You're a stranger
in town.

503
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,263
That's right.

504
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,732
Seems like I've seen
your face someplace.

505
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,367
Well, I wouldn't
know that.

506
00:36:52,434 --> 00:36:54,236
I've been
a lot of places.

507
00:36:54,302 --> 00:36:55,636
Hyah! Come on!

508
00:36:58,771 --> 00:37:00,072
Holy smoke!

509
00:37:00,139 --> 00:37:01,842
Holy smoke!

510
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:12,082
Now, son, I wouldn't
worry too much.

511
00:37:28,393 --> 00:37:29,660
Who was that?

512
00:37:29,727 --> 00:37:31,328
Why, it was the kid.

513
00:37:31,395 --> 00:37:34,331
Who, the kid? It couldn't be.
Wouldn't dare.

514
00:37:34,398 --> 00:37:35,565
Why, i...

515
00:37:35,632 --> 00:37:37,232
I guess
you're right, ned.

516
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:39,201
I must have been
mistaken.

517
00:37:41,704 --> 00:37:43,272
Now, about the trial.

518
00:37:43,338 --> 00:37:45,705
With judge hardwick on the bench,
there's nothing to alarm us.

519
00:37:45,772 --> 00:37:47,474
Dad, you're covering up.
It was him, wasn't it?

520
00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:50,476
Sheriff, the Oklahoma
kid's in town!

521
00:37:50,544 --> 00:37:51,276
I knew it!

522
00:37:51,342 --> 00:37:52,610
I saw him myself!

523
00:37:52,677 --> 00:37:53,746
Where are you
going, ned?

524
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,213
I think I know
where 'll be.

525
00:37:55,278 --> 00:37:57,014
Wait. Don't do anything
you'll regret.

526
00:38:23,233 --> 00:38:24,635
What are you doing here?

527
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:28,237
Hello, ma'am.

528
00:38:28,304 --> 00:38:30,372
Came here to see you
and talk to you.

529
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:31,907
You shouldn't be
in Tulsa.

530
00:38:31,974 --> 00:38:33,340
The whole town is
plastered with posters

531
00:38:33,407 --> 00:38:34,675
offering a reward
for you.

532
00:38:34,743 --> 00:38:37,676
I saw them... every one an
insult. A measly $500.

533
00:38:37,743 --> 00:38:39,345
Well, you'd better
come inside

534
00:38:39,412 --> 00:38:41,313
before someone tries
to collect it.

535
00:38:50,853 --> 00:38:52,821
Won't you come in?

536
00:38:52,888 --> 00:38:54,890
You're still
as crazy as ever.

537
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,025
Thank you, ma'am.

538
00:38:59,259 --> 00:39:00,227
I...

539
00:39:01,828 --> 00:39:03,095
Very pretty.

540
00:39:03,162 --> 00:39:04,597
This is aunt Maggie.

541
00:39:04,664 --> 00:39:06,265
How do you do,
aunt Maggie?

542
00:39:06,331 --> 00:39:09,601
The hem
got loose, and...

543
00:39:09,668 --> 00:39:10,801
I see.

544
00:39:10,868 --> 00:39:14,438
Well, excuse us,
aunt Maggie?

545
00:39:14,503 --> 00:39:16,440
We'd like
to be alone.

546
00:39:16,505 --> 00:39:17,740
There you are.

547
00:39:20,008 --> 00:39:21,609
Now you can stop
blushing.

548
00:39:21,677 --> 00:39:23,211
Did you say you
wanted to talk to me?

549
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,445
Yes, I did.

550
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:26,613
As a matter of fact, I want
to talk to your father.

551
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,947
Isn't here. I don't know
where I can reach him.

552
00:39:29,014 --> 00:39:31,950
You could help me
if you wanted to.

553
00:39:32,017 --> 00:39:35,152
They tell me that the candidate
for mayor is in jail.

554
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:36,321
Is that why you came?

555
00:39:36,387 --> 00:39:38,488
Yes, strangely
enough, it is.

556
00:39:38,555 --> 00:39:40,322
I don't like to see
anybody in jail.

557
00:39:40,389 --> 00:39:41,924
You can understand
that, can't you?

558
00:39:41,991 --> 00:39:44,160
I never know whether to
take you seriously or not.

559
00:39:44,225 --> 00:39:45,994
I'm absolutely
on the level.

560
00:39:46,062 --> 00:39:47,662
I'd really like
to help him.

561
00:39:47,728 --> 00:39:49,163
It's not going
to hurt anything

562
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,898
if you tell me what you know.
Please.

563
00:39:50,965 --> 00:39:55,434
Well, they say killed
a man, a Mr. bates.

564
00:39:55,501 --> 00:39:57,269
Let's not mind what they say.
What does say?

565
00:39:57,335 --> 00:39:59,170
Says that bates
sent for him.

566
00:39:59,236 --> 00:40:01,839
When arrived at bates'
house, found him dead.

567
00:40:01,906 --> 00:40:05,208
A few moments later, mccord and
some others of his crowd came in.

568
00:40:05,275 --> 00:40:08,610
They've sworn that Kincaid had the
gun in his hand when they entered.

569
00:40:08,676 --> 00:40:09,578
Why?

570
00:40:09,645 --> 00:40:11,079
Because they want him
out of the way.

571
00:40:11,146 --> 00:40:13,849
Thank heaven my father
will be the judge.

572
00:40:13,915 --> 00:40:15,815
Then you don't think they'll be
able to get away with anything?

573
00:40:15,882 --> 00:40:17,250
They most
certainly won't.

574
00:40:17,317 --> 00:40:20,719
Well, that's all
I wanted to know.

575
00:40:20,787 --> 00:40:21,820
'Cause if
you're satisfied...

576
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:23,187
I mean, you and your
father are satisfied

577
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:24,523
the old man didn't
do the killing.

578
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:27,825
Of course didn't.
'S not that kind.

579
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:30,360
My kind?

580
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:33,261
Yes, your kind.

581
00:40:33,328 --> 00:40:35,096
Thank you, ma'am.

582
00:40:35,163 --> 00:40:37,498
Why are you making this
your business, anyway?

583
00:40:37,566 --> 00:40:40,267
Because happens
to be my father.

584
00:40:40,334 --> 00:40:41,535
Your father?

585
00:40:43,437 --> 00:40:48,239
Hey, hey, hey.

586
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:53,977
Go out this way,
through the back door.

587
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,748
Here's a chance
to get yourself 500.

588
00:40:58,815 --> 00:41:00,415
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

589
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:04,052
Jane, I want
to talk to you.

590
00:41:08,321 --> 00:41:09,856
What's the matter,
ned?

591
00:41:09,923 --> 00:41:10,923
Where is?

592
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:11,590
Who?

593
00:41:11,657 --> 00:41:12,592
Sorry, aunt Maggie.

594
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:13,992
I'm looking for
the Oklahoma kid.

595
00:41:14,058 --> 00:41:15,926
I don't know who
you're talking about.

596
00:41:15,993 --> 00:41:17,760
Yes, you do.
You remember him.

597
00:41:17,827 --> 00:41:20,262
Danced with you that
night in cherokee city.

598
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:21,930
Yes, I remember him,
but...

599
00:41:21,998 --> 00:41:23,099
Well, 's here.

600
00:41:23,165 --> 00:41:24,266
In Tulsa?

601
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:25,401
In this house.

602
00:41:31,172 --> 00:41:34,173
Why, it's ridiculous.
Isn't.

603
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,942
Jane, look at me.

604
00:41:37,009 --> 00:41:39,545
I told you
isn't here.

605
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,613
Don't you
believe me?

606
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,582
I'm sorry.

607
00:41:46,182 --> 00:41:50,652
Ned, why didn't you ever tell
me that was your brother?

608
00:41:52,954 --> 00:41:54,256
How did you know that?

609
00:41:54,322 --> 00:41:55,889
I'd rather not say.

610
00:41:55,955 --> 00:41:57,890
<i>Then was here!</i>

611
00:41:57,957 --> 00:41:59,059
Yes, was.

612
00:41:59,124 --> 00:42:00,892
Why did you deny it?

613
00:42:00,959 --> 00:42:03,728
Because was your brother, and
I wanted him to get away.

614
00:42:03,795 --> 00:42:07,064
Are you sure that's the only
reason you wanted him to get away?

615
00:42:07,131 --> 00:42:08,199
Yes.

616
00:42:10,634 --> 00:42:12,235
Where did go?

617
00:42:12,302 --> 00:42:13,904
I don't know.

618
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:16,571
Ned, why didn't you
tell me about him?

619
00:42:16,638 --> 00:42:19,239
It's just that dad and
I don't think of him

620
00:42:19,306 --> 00:42:21,241
as a member of
the family anymore.

621
00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:22,643
Is that bad?

622
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:25,744
Wasn't as a kid.
We were great pals then.

623
00:42:25,811 --> 00:42:29,048
But as grew up,
everything changed.

624
00:42:29,112 --> 00:42:30,915
Got so thought
the law was meant

625
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:32,583
for one thing...
Just to be broken...

626
00:42:32,649 --> 00:42:35,084
So finally dad had
to throw him out.

627
00:42:35,151 --> 00:42:36,620
Why are you
so interested?

628
00:42:36,685 --> 00:42:39,254
I'm not. It's just that
's your brother and...

629
00:42:39,321 --> 00:42:41,756
Jane, you know how
I feel about you.

630
00:42:41,823 --> 00:42:43,392
Of course I do.

631
00:42:43,457 --> 00:42:46,926
I would have spoken sooner, but I
wanted to get myself established first.

632
00:42:46,994 --> 00:42:48,594
Please, ned,
not now.

633
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,363
Jane, will you marry me?

634
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:53,030
Ned, let's not
talk about it now.

635
00:42:53,097 --> 00:42:54,366
Come back later,
tonight.

636
00:42:54,433 --> 00:42:56,700
You are upset
about Jim, aren't you?

637
00:42:56,767 --> 00:42:58,035
Jim?

638
00:42:58,102 --> 00:42:59,369
That's the kid's name.

639
00:42:59,436 --> 00:43:01,537
Perhaps it is,
ned.

640
00:43:01,604 --> 00:43:04,372
I don't know,
but please go.

641
00:43:04,439 --> 00:43:06,174
All right.

642
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,062
Think you ought to
take him up on that.

643
00:43:34,128 --> 00:43:36,063
I thought
I told you to go.

644
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:38,230
And miss all that wonderful
lying you did for me? No.

645
00:43:38,297 --> 00:43:39,566
<i>I wasn't lying
for you.</i>

646
00:43:39,633 --> 00:43:41,300
Now you really are lying,
like a gentleman.

647
00:43:41,367 --> 00:43:43,236
Then it's lucky there's
one gentleman present.

648
00:43:43,302 --> 00:43:45,803
You mean I didn't thank you?
Well, I do thank you.

649
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:48,738
I really think you ought to grab
ned off. Make a great catch.

650
00:43:48,805 --> 00:43:52,841
Sober, serious-minded, industrious...
Law and order himself.

651
00:43:52,909 --> 00:43:54,176
Good-bye, ma'am.

652
00:43:54,243 --> 00:43:55,510
Where are you going?

653
00:43:55,577 --> 00:43:57,012
I'll be around.

654
00:43:57,079 --> 00:43:59,679
I'm going to give your father's
justice a chance to work,

655
00:43:59,746 --> 00:44:01,482
but it had better work.

656
00:44:08,253 --> 00:44:09,354
We haven't got
a case.

657
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,854
I've known this fella
hardwick for years.

658
00:44:10,921 --> 00:44:12,624
You can't get
to him.

659
00:44:12,689 --> 00:44:14,191
Hasn't bothered
us much so far.

660
00:44:14,259 --> 00:44:16,193
That was different. We were getting
people off, not convicting them.

661
00:44:16,258 --> 00:44:17,693
It's easy to fake
a prosecution,

662
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,161
especially when
the witnesses are fixed.

663
00:44:19,227 --> 00:44:22,429
Why not? We own the
jury, don't we?

664
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:24,198
It won't get to the jury.

665
00:44:24,264 --> 00:44:27,199
If we'd used some cleverness in framing
this thing, we might have had a chance,

666
00:44:27,266 --> 00:44:29,468
but with the case we've got,
hardwick will throw us out of court.

667
00:44:29,535 --> 00:44:31,202
Well, then, we'll
get rid of him.

668
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:33,038
Use sense,
whip.

669
00:44:33,105 --> 00:44:34,540
I am.

670
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:38,041
Regardless of hardwick,
Kincaid's going to swing.

671
00:44:38,107 --> 00:44:40,376
We'll start a run
on that bank of his,

672
00:44:40,443 --> 00:44:42,477
and when it goes down,
we'll take it over.

673
00:44:42,545 --> 00:44:45,881
We'll get the rest of those upright
citizens one way or another.

674
00:44:45,948 --> 00:44:49,217
When we end up, this will
be my town, wide-open,

675
00:44:49,284 --> 00:44:52,486
with more money pouring in
than you ever saw before.

676
00:44:52,551 --> 00:44:56,154
In the meantime, we've still
got to worry about hardwick.

677
00:44:56,222 --> 00:44:57,823
Yeah.

678
00:44:57,889 --> 00:44:59,591
How long
have you known him?

679
00:44:59,656 --> 00:45:01,826
10 or 12 years.
'S from Kansas City.

680
00:45:01,893 --> 00:45:03,493
There's nothing on him.
I've tried that before.

681
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:05,161
Has got
any relatives?

682
00:45:05,229 --> 00:45:07,530
Yeah, a brother. Feed
merchant in Kansas City.

683
00:45:07,596 --> 00:45:10,500
All right. We'll get
hardwick out of the way.

684
00:45:10,565 --> 00:45:13,001
You have the trial moved
up a couple of days.

685
00:45:13,066 --> 00:45:14,168
I think
I can do that.

686
00:45:14,234 --> 00:45:15,668
That'll give us
Morgan for the judge.

687
00:45:15,735 --> 00:45:17,838
Doolin, get me a boy
we can trust...

688
00:45:17,904 --> 00:45:19,872
Somebody that isn't
known around here.

689
00:45:19,939 --> 00:45:22,707
All right, come on.
Get moving.

690
00:45:22,775 --> 00:45:24,509
All right, write a
letter to hardwick.

691
00:45:24,576 --> 00:45:26,176
We'll make it look as though
it came from his brother.

692
00:45:26,243 --> 00:45:28,046
I'll have a friend of mine
mail it from Kansas City.

693
00:45:46,725 --> 00:45:48,594
This is bad news,
judge, very bad.

694
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:49,761
I'm extremely sorry.

695
00:45:49,828 --> 00:45:51,762
Well, of course,
I'll leave immediately.

696
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:54,432
I'll catch this morning's
stage for Kansas City.

697
00:45:54,497 --> 00:45:57,899
Yes, I suppose you must,
but what about Kincaid?

698
00:45:57,967 --> 00:45:59,601
I'll have plenty
of time

699
00:45:59,667 --> 00:46:01,602
to get to Kansas City and
back before the trial.

700
00:46:01,669 --> 00:46:03,437
Watch over things while
I'm gone, will you?

701
00:46:03,505 --> 00:46:04,405
Of course.

702
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:11,610
All right, boys.
Everybody up!

703
00:46:11,677 --> 00:46:13,611
It's on the house...
A celebration!

704
00:46:19,515 --> 00:46:22,784
Here's to Mr. Ringo, the
smartest lawyer west of Chicago!

705
00:46:24,686 --> 00:46:28,122
And the trial set up for tomorrow
with judge Morgan presiding.

706
00:46:28,189 --> 00:46:29,891
Hooray
for Mr. Ringo!

707
00:46:42,665 --> 00:46:44,100
This can't be true.

708
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:47,036
I just received a postcard this
morning from uncle Stephen.

709
00:46:47,102 --> 00:46:49,270
'S not dying, and 's
not in Kansas City.

710
00:46:49,337 --> 00:46:50,872
'S in Montreal.

711
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,041
You think
him trick?

712
00:46:53,108 --> 00:46:55,709
Of course it is, to get
father out of town.

713
00:46:55,775 --> 00:46:57,210
When did
the stage leave?

714
00:46:57,277 --> 00:47:00,913
Maybe 4, 5 hours ago.

715
00:47:00,979 --> 00:47:02,881
Get my horse saddled,
quick!

716
00:47:36,472 --> 00:47:37,573
Good morning, ma'am.

717
00:47:37,639 --> 00:47:39,174
Kind of a hot morning
to be riding so fast.

718
00:47:39,241 --> 00:47:40,675
Please don't stop me. I've got
to catch father. The trial...

719
00:47:40,742 --> 00:47:43,178
Just a minute. Get those
words out one at a time

720
00:47:43,245 --> 00:47:44,511
so I can
understand them.

721
00:47:44,578 --> 00:47:45,846
Yes, you should know.

722
00:47:45,913 --> 00:47:47,380
Somebody's tricked father
with this letter.

723
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,914
It must be mccord.

724
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,685
Not a word of it's true. It's
just to get him out of town.

725
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:52,751
Why?

726
00:47:52,816 --> 00:47:54,351
Mccord owns judge Morgan,
that's why.

727
00:47:54,418 --> 00:47:57,254
They've moved the trial up to
tomorrow. Morgan will preside.

728
00:47:57,321 --> 00:47:58,756
And they'll railroad
the old man.

729
00:47:58,823 --> 00:48:01,624
Unless I can bring father
back in time.

730
00:48:01,691 --> 00:48:02,959
Look here, you go on,
get back to town.

731
00:48:03,026 --> 00:48:04,226
Back to town?

732
00:48:04,292 --> 00:48:06,361
Get hold of the old man's
lawyer. Show him that.

733
00:48:06,427 --> 00:48:07,861
Tell him 's got
to delay that trial

734
00:48:07,928 --> 00:48:09,063
if you got to pull a trick out
of the bottom of the bag.

735
00:48:09,129 --> 00:48:10,064
But father...

736
00:48:10,131 --> 00:48:11,565
I'll go after him,
bring him back.

737
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:13,032
I'm kind of handy
at stopping stages.

738
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:17,202
All right. I'm so
glad you saw me.

739
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,070
I see you more often
than you know.

740
00:48:19,137 --> 00:48:20,939
I said I'd be around,
didn't I?

741
00:49:28,688 --> 00:49:31,089
Hello! Hey, wake
up in there!

742
00:49:31,156 --> 00:49:34,458
Hello in there!
Hey, wake up!

743
00:49:34,525 --> 00:49:36,293
Who is it?
What do you want?

744
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,593
- Stage go by here?
- Yeah.

745
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:39,428
- How long ago?
- About two hours.

746
00:49:39,495 --> 00:49:41,095
Put up the gun. I want
a change of horse.

747
00:49:41,162 --> 00:49:42,398
I'm willing
to pay for it.

748
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:55,553
Which...

749
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:05,559
Hyah!

750
00:51:12,897 --> 00:51:14,832
All right, boys.
Throw them down.

751
00:51:14,899 --> 00:51:16,601
The rest of you
can take it easy.

752
00:51:16,668 --> 00:51:18,403
All I want is judge hardwick.
Come on.

753
00:51:21,004 --> 00:51:23,271
Well. You?

754
00:51:23,338 --> 00:51:25,840
Yep. Put them down, judge.
This is no holdup.

755
00:51:25,907 --> 00:51:27,441
Well, what is it,
then?

756
00:51:27,509 --> 00:51:30,010
This may surprise you, but right now
I'm working for law and justice.

757
00:51:30,077 --> 00:51:31,845
Your brother
isn't sick at all.

758
00:51:31,912 --> 00:51:33,414
Mccord sent you that note
to get you out of town.

759
00:51:33,479 --> 00:51:34,714
How did you know
about that note?

760
00:51:34,781 --> 00:51:36,616
- Your daughter told me.
- My daughter?

761
00:51:36,681 --> 00:51:40,418
Yeah. She didn't like the looks of it,
and I did a little investigating.

762
00:51:40,485 --> 00:51:43,619
Mccord has had the trial moved up,
and judge Morgan is presiding.

763
00:51:43,687 --> 00:51:44,922
- Morgan?
- Yeah.

764
00:51:44,988 --> 00:51:46,423
That sounds like him.

765
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:48,157
What's your interest
in this?

766
00:51:48,224 --> 00:51:51,293
My name is Jim Kincaid.

767
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,194
Are you
John Kincaid's son?

768
00:51:53,261 --> 00:51:55,796
Yeah. But this is wasting a
lot of good time. Come on.

769
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,297
Have you got
another mount?

770
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,199
No, but we can pick one up at a
settler's cabin down the road.

771
00:51:59,266 --> 00:52:01,533
All right, boys,
on your way.

772
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,035
Hyah!

773
00:52:03,102 --> 00:52:04,336
Hyah!

774
00:52:14,776 --> 00:52:16,312
Handley,
take the stand.

775
00:52:23,482 --> 00:52:25,084
Raise your right hand.

776
00:52:25,152 --> 00:52:26,685
Do you swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth,

777
00:52:26,752 --> 00:52:28,687
and nothing but the
truth, so help you god?

778
00:52:28,752 --> 00:52:31,021
You say that Mr. bates was
alive when you left the house?

779
00:52:31,088 --> 00:52:34,124
Yes, sir.
Showed us out.

780
00:52:34,191 --> 00:52:35,926
Ned tolley
can tell you that.

781
00:52:35,991 --> 00:52:38,393
Saw bates come to the door
and say good night to us.

782
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,829
I object, your honor, to the
witness testifying that...

783
00:52:40,896 --> 00:52:42,998
Overruled. Proceed.

784
00:52:43,064 --> 00:52:45,733
Mr. tolley saw bates
see you out.

785
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,066
Yes, sir.

786
00:52:47,133 --> 00:52:48,702
What did you do then?

787
00:52:48,769 --> 00:52:51,771
We walked on down
toward the square.

788
00:52:51,837 --> 00:52:52,970
I happened
to turn around

789
00:52:53,037 --> 00:52:55,506
just in time to see Mr.
Kincaid go into the house.

790
00:52:55,573 --> 00:52:56,672
Then?

791
00:52:56,739 --> 00:52:58,674
Well, that kind of
worried us.

792
00:52:58,741 --> 00:53:00,776
We knew Kincaid had
it in for bates...

793
00:53:00,843 --> 00:53:02,879
I object, your honor,
to the witness...

794
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:05,414
Overruled. Proceed.

795
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,381
So we went back.

796
00:53:07,449 --> 00:53:10,118
Just as I got to the
door, I heard a shot.

797
00:53:10,185 --> 00:53:12,019
We busted in and
found Mr. Kincaid

798
00:53:12,085 --> 00:53:14,021
standing in the
center of the room

799
00:53:14,086 --> 00:53:15,854
with a gun
in his hand

800
00:53:15,921 --> 00:53:18,089
and Mr. bates lying
on the floor dead.

801
00:53:26,096 --> 00:53:27,696
What did you
do then?

802
00:53:27,762 --> 00:53:30,197
Naturally, we looked
to see if was dead.

803
00:53:30,264 --> 00:53:31,699
Was.

804
00:53:31,766 --> 00:53:33,868
We took the gun away
from Kincaid

805
00:53:33,934 --> 00:53:35,535
and sent for
the sheriff.

806
00:53:35,602 --> 00:53:37,405
Not ned... the old sheriff,
hartley.

807
00:53:41,206 --> 00:53:46,242
Kincaid came up the steps to
mccord and said to all of us...

808
00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:47,911
Well, anybody could tell you
what said.

809
00:53:47,978 --> 00:53:49,912
I object, your honor, to the
witness testifying that...

810
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,282
Overruled.
Proceed.

811
00:53:52,348 --> 00:53:55,051
Well, said, "I'm going
to get you, mccord,

812
00:53:55,117 --> 00:53:58,652
"and I'm going
to get bates, too.

813
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:01,789
One way or another,
I'm going to get you."

814
00:54:06,958 --> 00:54:11,128
So, gentlemen, if you think the
defendant did shoot and kill Mr. bates,

815
00:54:11,195 --> 00:54:14,598
you can find him guilty
of murder in the first degree.

816
00:54:14,665 --> 00:54:18,468
On the other hand, if you think
did not kill him

817
00:54:18,535 --> 00:54:20,969
and there's any reasonable
doubts in your mind,

818
00:54:21,036 --> 00:54:22,471
you'll find him not guilty.

819
00:54:22,538 --> 00:54:24,638
The jury will retire.

820
00:54:24,705 --> 00:54:29,943
Your honor, I don't think there's
any need for the jury to retire.

821
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:32,011
We can take a vote
right here.

822
00:54:54,094 --> 00:54:55,061
I'm so glad
you're back.

823
00:54:55,128 --> 00:54:56,595
Where's dad?

824
00:54:56,662 --> 00:55:00,364
Stopped at the bank to see Mr.
Martin. Well, what's happened?

825
00:55:00,431 --> 00:55:01,731
Has the trial started?

826
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,967
It's all over.
They found him guilty.

827
00:55:04,033 --> 00:55:05,734
It was the worst kind
of a farce.

828
00:55:05,801 --> 00:55:07,736
They'd hardly let
Mr. Martin speak.

829
00:55:07,802 --> 00:55:11,538
Well, I guess
I'll be moving along.

830
00:55:11,605 --> 00:55:13,073
Don't do
anything foolish.

831
00:55:13,141 --> 00:55:15,408
<i>It seems to me that's just
what I've been doing,</i>

832
00:55:15,474 --> 00:55:17,744
riding around trying to catch
the law by the coattails.

833
00:55:17,811 --> 00:55:19,578
Perhaps dad can get
a new trial.

834
00:55:19,645 --> 00:55:21,746
Perhaps can prove that
this one was illegal.

835
00:55:21,813 --> 00:55:25,249
Perhaps, but you can't expect him
to lean on any of these people.

836
00:55:25,316 --> 00:55:27,417
Jim, think of your father
and how feels.

837
00:55:27,485 --> 00:55:29,453
'S an honorable man.
'S lived with the law.

838
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,787
Yes. I think
's very lucky

839
00:55:30,852 --> 00:55:32,789
to have a no-good son to
see doesn't die by it.

840
00:55:32,856 --> 00:55:34,456
I don't think 'd
get much satisfaction

841
00:55:34,521 --> 00:55:36,123
out of having
your father, the judge,

842
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:37,725
read blackstone
at his burial.

843
00:55:43,697 --> 00:55:44,932
Hyah!

844
00:56:14,586 --> 00:56:16,887
Get them up.

845
00:56:16,954 --> 00:56:19,788
Over here.

846
00:56:19,855 --> 00:56:20,790
All right, out.
Come on.

847
00:56:21,524 --> 00:56:22,292
Is that cell empty?

848
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:25,126
Yeah.

849
00:56:25,193 --> 00:56:26,628
Now, where's
my old man's cell?

850
00:56:26,694 --> 00:56:27,361
Who?

851
00:56:27,428 --> 00:56:29,063
- Kincaid.
- Your father?

852
00:56:29,129 --> 00:56:30,196
Where's his cell?

853
00:56:30,263 --> 00:56:31,196
Upstairs, in front.

854
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:32,332
Get in.

855
00:56:46,942 --> 00:56:48,109
John Kincaid?

856
00:56:48,176 --> 00:56:49,510
Hello! Here!

857
00:56:49,577 --> 00:56:50,311
Hello, pop.

858
00:56:50,378 --> 00:56:52,581
Jim!

859
00:56:52,648 --> 00:56:54,581
Come on, pop. I'm taking
you out of this tin can.

860
00:56:54,647 --> 00:56:55,916
No,
you're not.

861
00:56:55,984 --> 00:56:57,249
Come on,
get into that coat.

862
00:56:57,316 --> 00:56:58,584
I don't need
your help.

863
00:56:58,651 --> 00:56:59,753
Wrong again.

864
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:01,420
If you're going
to depend upon the law,

865
00:57:01,487 --> 00:57:03,089
you're going to wind up
on the end of a rope.

866
00:57:03,154 --> 00:57:05,789
Hey!

867
00:57:05,856 --> 00:57:07,291
Go to the bank
and get the sheriff.

868
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:09,359
The kid is breaking
Kincaid out of jail.

869
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,993
And here's one for you...
The kid is Kincaid's son!

870
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:13,228
What's that?

871
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:14,396
Yeah. Now, get going!

872
00:57:14,463 --> 00:57:18,666
I know you mean well, but there's an issue
in this town you wouldn't understand...

873
00:57:18,733 --> 00:57:20,334
Law or anarchy.

874
00:57:20,401 --> 00:57:23,668
I represent law and order.
You don't. You never have.

875
00:57:23,735 --> 00:57:25,336
I'm not here to argue
right from wrong.

876
00:57:25,403 --> 00:57:27,506
Do I have to hit you over the
head or carry you over my back?

877
00:57:27,571 --> 00:57:29,040
That's the only way you'll
get me to go with you.

878
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:34,243
If I let you take the law in your hands,
it would be an admission of my guilt.

879
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:35,545
You see, Jim,

880
00:57:35,611 --> 00:57:38,213
it isn't only my freedom
that I'm fighting for.

881
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,514
But they've
got you framed!

882
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,550
Sheriff, the kid's
got the keys.

883
00:57:41,615 --> 00:57:44,151
Went upstairs
to the old man's cell.

884
00:57:44,217 --> 00:57:46,586
Come on!
Come on!

885
00:57:48,088 --> 00:57:49,222
So long, pop.

886
00:57:49,288 --> 00:57:50,322
Good luck, son.

887
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:10,603
Locked the deputies
in the cell

888
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:12,438
and went upstairs
to get Kincaid.

889
00:58:12,505 --> 00:58:14,440
What do you think? Kincaid
is the kid's old man!

890
00:58:14,508 --> 00:58:17,109
Say, that makes it easy.
That's a jailbreak.

891
00:58:17,174 --> 00:58:19,245
<i>This time, we'll be
the vigilantes.</i>

892
00:58:25,014 --> 00:58:26,349
Men, come over here!

893
00:58:26,415 --> 00:58:29,717
Come in close!

894
00:58:29,785 --> 00:58:31,586
You all know
the Oklahoma kid?

895
00:58:31,652 --> 00:58:33,154
Yeah!

896
00:58:33,221 --> 00:58:37,256
Well, I just heard that the Oklahoma
kid is old man Kincaid's son.

897
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:40,659
And what's more,
the kid's in town right now,

898
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:42,660
trying to break
his old man out of jail!

899
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:48,332
Old man Kincaid
was convicted of a murder.

900
00:58:48,398 --> 00:58:51,500
A jury made up of you men
said that should hang.

901
00:58:52,667 --> 00:58:54,269
Yes, of course should!

902
00:58:54,336 --> 00:58:57,871
Are you going to stand by and let an
outlaw take a murderer out of jail?

903
00:58:57,938 --> 00:58:59,440
No!

904
00:58:59,507 --> 00:59:02,109
If the law won't
stop him, we will!

905
00:59:02,176 --> 00:59:06,445
Right. And if the law won't hang
Kincaid, then it's up to us!

906
00:59:06,512 --> 00:59:11,416
And if we get the Oklahoma kid,
we'll hang him, too!

907
00:59:11,482 --> 00:59:12,749
Are you with me?

908
00:59:13,918 --> 00:59:15,353
What are we waiting for?
Let's go!

909
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:19,321
Go with them
and keep them hot.

910
00:59:35,033 --> 00:59:36,834
Come on, boys,
for old man Kincaid!

911
00:59:36,901 --> 00:59:38,169
Looks like
a hanging party.

912
00:59:40,103 --> 00:59:42,171
Mccord gang's
in the lead.

913
00:59:47,509 --> 00:59:49,542
Think this will
fit him, boys?

914
00:59:49,609 --> 00:59:51,312
Let's go up and try it
out on old man Kincaid.

915
00:59:52,379 --> 00:59:54,881
They're on their way
to the jail.

916
00:59:54,947 --> 00:59:56,182
Come on, boys!

917
00:59:59,951 --> 01:00:01,785
Come on, where
are those keys?

918
01:00:03,019 --> 01:00:04,021
Come on, boys!

919
01:00:12,627 --> 01:00:14,663
Here is!

920
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:18,731
Where's the kid?

921
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:19,532
I don't know.

922
01:00:19,597 --> 01:00:20,498
Was here,
wasn't?

923
01:00:20,565 --> 01:00:21,133
Yes.

924
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:22,266
Helping you to escape.

925
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:23,500
Wanted me
to go with him.

926
01:00:23,567 --> 01:00:24,769
That's all
I wanted to know.

927
01:00:24,836 --> 01:00:26,236
Listen to me, in
the name of the law!

928
01:00:26,303 --> 01:00:27,269
Shut up!

929
01:01:49,731 --> 01:01:51,467
Hello, Jane.

930
01:01:51,532 --> 01:01:53,134
Do you know where
my old man is?

931
01:01:54,801 --> 01:01:56,804
'S in there.

932
01:01:58,537 --> 01:02:03,308
Jim, they've killed him.

933
01:02:03,375 --> 01:02:04,943
The mob broke
into the jail, and...

934
01:02:31,729 --> 01:02:33,531
Who was it?
Mccord?

935
01:02:33,597 --> 01:02:36,465
No, his gang, but
mccord wasn't there.

936
01:02:36,531 --> 01:02:37,933
Do you know
who was there?

937
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,371
There was doolin, curley,
Indian Joe, and handley.

938
01:02:43,438 --> 01:02:46,740
Doolin, curley,
Indian Joe, and handley.

939
01:02:46,807 --> 01:02:48,575
What are you going
to do about it?

940
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,441
I'm going to the territorial
governor in the morning

941
01:02:50,509 --> 01:02:53,344
and insist put this
town under marshal law.

942
01:02:53,411 --> 01:02:55,812
A little bit late
for that.

943
01:02:55,879 --> 01:02:58,481
Then we'll go after the ringleaders
and bring them to trial.

944
01:02:58,548 --> 01:03:01,850
You better do it fast if you
want to get there ahead of me.

945
01:03:07,722 --> 01:03:09,089
Father stop him.

946
01:03:09,156 --> 01:03:11,324
Stop him!
'Ll be killed.

947
01:03:11,391 --> 01:03:13,225
You couldn't stop
him now, Jane.

948
01:03:13,292 --> 01:03:15,796
I don't know as I want to.

949
01:03:24,701 --> 01:03:25,869
Come on,
get over there.

950
01:03:25,936 --> 01:03:27,070
Over.

951
01:03:30,872 --> 01:03:33,007
Now,
where's mccord?

952
01:03:33,074 --> 01:03:33,941
Ain't here.

953
01:03:34,008 --> 01:03:35,775
And curley,
doolin, and handley?

954
01:03:35,841 --> 01:03:37,209
They ain't here either.

955
01:03:37,277 --> 01:03:38,179
Indian Joe?

956
01:03:43,248 --> 01:03:44,648
Where's mccord?

957
01:03:44,716 --> 01:03:46,082
I don't know, kid.

958
01:03:46,149 --> 01:03:47,317
Who did the hanging?

959
01:03:47,383 --> 01:03:48,586
I don't know, kid.

960
01:03:48,653 --> 01:03:50,386
It was mccord, wasn't it?
Was in on it.

961
01:03:50,453 --> 01:03:52,721
I don't know, I tell you.
I don't know.

962
01:03:52,788 --> 01:03:54,689
All right.
Come on down here.

963
01:04:04,229 --> 01:04:07,198
Now, you can tell mccord
and the rest of his gang,

964
01:04:07,266 --> 01:04:08,699
I'll be calling
on them, too.

965
01:04:20,907 --> 01:04:22,443
Great bunch of quitting rats,
the whole crowd of you.

966
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:23,843
A couple of hundred men,
and the kid walks in

967
01:04:23,909 --> 01:04:27,379
and picks off Indian Joe like
it was a shooting gallery.

968
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:28,847
We didn't have
a chance, boss.

969
01:04:28,914 --> 01:04:32,416
Now, look, get out!

970
01:04:32,483 --> 01:04:34,152
The kid said was going
to get us all, whip.

971
01:04:34,219 --> 01:04:35,152
Named every one of us.

972
01:04:35,218 --> 01:04:36,285
Are you
turning yellow, too?

973
01:04:36,352 --> 01:04:38,254
No, but don't you think
we ought to duck,

974
01:04:38,321 --> 01:04:39,855
at least till
the law gets the kid?

975
01:04:39,922 --> 01:04:41,391
No.
I'm staying here.

976
01:04:41,458 --> 01:04:43,759
This is my town, and nobody's
going to run me out of it.

977
01:04:43,826 --> 01:04:46,461
The kid wants to shoot it
out with me, I'll be here.

978
01:04:46,528 --> 01:04:48,062
How do we stand
legally?

979
01:04:48,128 --> 01:04:49,995
Just like I told you,
you weren't there.

980
01:04:50,062 --> 01:04:52,464
You're all right unless somebody
can prove you started it.

981
01:04:52,531 --> 01:04:54,332
They can't prove that unless
somebody says something.

982
01:04:54,398 --> 01:04:55,400
No.

983
01:04:55,468 --> 01:04:56,669
There ain't nobody
gonna say nothing.

984
01:04:56,736 --> 01:04:58,470
But the boys here are not
in such a good spot.

985
01:04:58,536 --> 01:04:59,705
There was a big
crowd there,

986
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,704
and some of the citizens
must have recognized them.

987
01:05:01,771 --> 01:05:02,772
I'm going to
hit the trail.

988
01:05:02,839 --> 01:05:04,008
Might be best
if they all did.

989
01:05:04,075 --> 01:05:05,474
I don't want any
part of that kid.

990
01:05:05,541 --> 01:05:08,244
I'm with doolin.
I think we better go.

991
01:05:08,311 --> 01:05:11,013
- All right.
- Go ahead, run out.

992
01:05:11,078 --> 01:05:14,615
If anybody talks, you won't
have to worry about the kid.

993
01:05:59,348 --> 01:06:00,681
How far is it
to burden?

994
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:03,584
That's over the Kansas
line about 30 miles.

995
01:06:03,651 --> 01:06:06,119
You figuring on getting
there tonight?

996
01:06:06,185 --> 01:06:07,553
How many horses
you got?

997
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:10,289
None. Just a mule,
and 's lame.

998
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:15,894
Go on. You two better get
out of here. Go on. Go.

999
01:06:20,396 --> 01:06:21,631
Where's doolin
and handley?

1000
01:06:21,697 --> 01:06:23,431
How should
I know?

1001
01:06:23,498 --> 01:06:24,665
You were in on the hanging,
weren't you?

1002
01:06:24,732 --> 01:06:26,634
No. Give me
a chance, kid.

1003
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:29,036
I'll give you the same chance
I gave Indian Joe.

1004
01:06:30,304 --> 01:06:31,438
Go on, reach for it.

1005
01:06:33,806 --> 01:06:36,909
Well, if you don't reach
for it, I can't shoot you.

1006
01:07:26,378 --> 01:07:26,979
What'll it be?

1007
01:07:27,044 --> 01:07:27,479
Whiskey.

1008
01:07:27,546 --> 01:07:28,480
Right.

1009
01:09:55,521 --> 01:09:57,456
Come out
and get me, kid!

1010
01:10:02,458 --> 01:10:03,927
Aha!

1011
01:10:22,974 --> 01:10:25,109
I didn't do it, kid.

1012
01:10:25,175 --> 01:10:28,578
I didn't...It was mccord.

1013
01:10:28,644 --> 01:10:31,813
Mccord...Water...

1014
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:35,183
It was mc...
It was mccord...

1015
01:10:39,119 --> 01:10:41,054
First Indian Joe...

1016
01:10:41,121 --> 01:10:44,724
Then curley.

1017
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:46,691
The list dispatched from
Kansas City simply says

1018
01:10:46,758 --> 01:10:48,760
they found handley's body
in the freight yards

1019
01:10:48,826 --> 01:10:49,860
with the neck broken.

1020
01:10:49,928 --> 01:10:51,460
Yeah, but, judge, you
know as well as I do,

1021
01:10:51,527 --> 01:10:52,629
the kid got him
just the same

1022
01:10:52,695 --> 01:10:54,063
as got curley
and Indian Joe.

1023
01:10:54,131 --> 01:10:55,096
Yes, I know.

1024
01:10:55,163 --> 01:10:56,832
And one of these
days we'll hear that

1025
01:10:56,899 --> 01:10:58,500
doolin has gone
to his reward...

1026
01:10:58,567 --> 01:11:00,167
Whatever that
may amount to...

1027
01:11:00,234 --> 01:11:02,469
And then we'll chalk up
another for the kid.

1028
01:11:02,536 --> 01:11:05,471
Yes, it's a puzzle to know
how to feel. A man's torn.

1029
01:11:05,539 --> 01:11:07,639
One side of him says it's a
frightful thing for a lad

1030
01:11:07,706 --> 01:11:09,941
to be piling up such
a record of bloodshed,

1031
01:11:10,008 --> 01:11:12,176
and the other side of him
says, "go get him, kid.

1032
01:11:12,244 --> 01:11:13,478
Get doolin next."

1033
01:11:21,384 --> 01:11:23,385
If only we could get
evidence against mccord

1034
01:11:23,451 --> 01:11:24,618
and bring him
to trial.

1035
01:11:24,686 --> 01:11:26,655
Martin, you know,
that ned has worked as hard

1036
01:11:26,721 --> 01:11:28,956
as any man possibly could
these past few weeks.

1037
01:11:29,021 --> 01:11:30,524
It's impossible
to get evidence.

1038
01:11:30,591 --> 01:11:33,525
The mccord gang is a closed
corporation of closed mouths.

1039
01:11:33,592 --> 01:11:34,993
If we don't hurry up,

1040
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:37,228
the kid won't leave anybody for
us to get evidence against.

1041
01:11:51,604 --> 01:11:52,772
Jim.

1042
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,075
Hello, Jane.

1043
01:11:54,142 --> 01:11:55,142
Is your father in?

1044
01:11:55,209 --> 01:11:57,278
'S inside
with Mr. Martin.

1045
01:11:59,478 --> 01:12:00,747
I've got something
that'll interest him.

1046
01:12:02,114 --> 01:12:03,348
Jim, you shouldn't
come here.

1047
01:12:03,414 --> 01:12:04,983
Do you realize there's
a price on your head?

1048
01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:06,783
Yeah, yeah. Look, I've
got doolin outside.

1049
01:12:06,849 --> 01:12:07,784
- Doolin?
- Dead or alive?

1050
01:12:07,851 --> 01:12:09,252
A little bit of each.

1051
01:12:09,318 --> 01:12:11,321
But I think may be revived
enough to bring his voice back.

1052
01:12:11,388 --> 01:12:12,854
What did you get
out of him?

1053
01:12:12,921 --> 01:12:15,257
The whole story, and I don't
think I'd like to hear it again,

1054
01:12:15,322 --> 01:12:16,691
so I'll leave him
in your hands.

1055
01:12:16,758 --> 01:12:19,661
Take doolin down to the jail
with ned. I'll be right down.

1056
01:12:19,726 --> 01:12:22,127
Well, in that case,
I'll be going, too.

1057
01:12:22,194 --> 01:12:24,230
Jim, what are you
going to do?

1058
01:12:24,297 --> 01:12:25,763
I've got a date
with mccord.

1059
01:12:25,831 --> 01:12:27,399
Son, I know
just how you feel.

1060
01:12:27,465 --> 01:12:29,699
In that case, you won't hold me
up with a lot of talk, will you?

1061
01:12:29,767 --> 01:12:30,867
Haven't you
done enough?

1062
01:12:30,934 --> 01:12:32,436
I haven't done anything,

1063
01:12:32,503 --> 01:12:35,604
except kill a lot of
coyotes in self-defense,

1064
01:12:35,671 --> 01:12:37,539
if you want to
put it in law talk.

1065
01:12:40,308 --> 01:12:41,542
Please wait.

1066
01:12:41,608 --> 01:12:43,376
It's no use, Jane.

1067
01:12:43,443 --> 01:12:45,912
Would it mean anything to you
if I asked you not to go?

1068
01:12:45,979 --> 01:12:48,181
Don't talk like that.
You and ned are...

1069
01:12:48,248 --> 01:12:49,882
I love you, Jim.

1070
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:51,449
You don't know
what you're saying.

1071
01:12:51,516 --> 01:12:56,921
I'm no kind of a man a woman
could tie her bonnet to. Ned is.

1072
01:12:56,987 --> 01:12:58,654
Women are crazy.

1073
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:00,924
That's why they fall
in love with the wrong men.

1074
01:13:00,991 --> 01:13:04,393
But they do.
Now will you stay?

1075
01:13:04,459 --> 01:13:07,428
No, no. I've started
a job, Jane.

1076
01:13:07,494 --> 01:13:09,795
I've got to finish it.

1077
01:13:09,863 --> 01:13:11,565
It's a small point
of honor

1078
01:13:11,631 --> 01:13:13,933
that maybe a woman
wouldn't understand.

1079
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,235
All right, Jim.
I'll try to understand.

1080
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:19,204
There's only one thing
I want, really,

1081
01:13:19,271 --> 01:13:22,138
and that is for you
to come back safely.

1082
01:13:33,647 --> 01:13:35,183
Give me some of
that water, will you?

1083
01:13:35,249 --> 01:13:38,584
Take it easy, doolin. Tell me one more
thing, then you can have a drink.

1084
01:13:38,651 --> 01:13:41,887
I'll tell you everything,
only give me a drink of water...

1085
01:13:41,953 --> 01:13:43,555
Mccord responsible for
that lynching or not?

1086
01:13:43,621 --> 01:13:44,855
Water, please.

1087
01:13:44,922 --> 01:13:46,624
Mccord responsible
for that lynching?!

1088
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:49,192
Yes, of course was. Was
behind the whole thing.

1089
01:13:49,259 --> 01:13:50,759
Excited
the boys to do it.

1090
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:52,061
That's all
you need, ned.

1091
01:13:52,126 --> 01:13:53,195
Here's our witness.

1092
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:54,363
Give him a drink.

1093
01:13:54,429 --> 01:13:56,897
I'm going down
and arrest mccord.

1094
01:13:56,964 --> 01:13:58,231
Water.

1095
01:14:02,067 --> 01:14:03,002
Whip, I saw the kid.

1096
01:14:03,068 --> 01:14:04,802
Brought doolin
into town.

1097
01:14:04,869 --> 01:14:06,905
'Ll be
coming here next.

1098
01:14:06,972 --> 01:14:09,607
All right, fine.
I'll be glad to see him.

1099
01:14:15,177 --> 01:14:16,578
Now, you two boys
go outside,

1100
01:14:16,646 --> 01:14:19,114
and when the kid shows up,
make sure you draw first.

1101
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:20,682
Make sure your aim
is good.

1102
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:21,616
Leave it to us,
whip.

1103
01:14:21,683 --> 01:14:22,550
We'll watch him.

1104
01:15:04,114 --> 01:15:07,749
Mccord, you're
under arrest.

1105
01:15:07,815 --> 01:15:10,484
Get your hands up
and walk toward me.

1106
01:15:48,045 --> 01:15:48,947
Look out, kid.

1107
01:17:14,776 --> 01:17:16,411
Good work, ned.
Good work.

1108
01:17:16,477 --> 01:17:20,214
Yeah. We make a good team

1109
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,547
when we're working
on the same side.

1110
01:17:22,614 --> 01:17:23,550
Now, don't talk
anymore.

1111
01:17:23,615 --> 01:17:24,617
You're not hurt
much.

1112
01:17:24,684 --> 01:17:26,417
I'll go and scare up
a sawbones. Come on.

1113
01:17:26,484 --> 01:17:28,652
No, wait.
I must tell you now.

1114
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:31,088
I wrote the governor,

1115
01:17:31,155 --> 01:17:34,656
said you'd been working
on the side of the law,

1116
01:17:34,723 --> 01:17:36,358
asked him for
a pardon for...

1117
01:17:36,425 --> 01:17:37,825
Never mind that.
You'll be all right.

1118
01:17:37,892 --> 01:17:39,328
Just get up here,
and I'll get you.

1119
01:17:39,394 --> 01:17:40,429
I'll get you.

1120
01:17:42,197 --> 01:17:43,830
Remember when
we were kids,

1121
01:17:43,897 --> 01:17:45,866
you fell out
of the apple tree?

1122
01:17:45,933 --> 01:17:47,500
I had to carry you home
that time.

1123
01:17:47,566 --> 01:17:49,167
Yeah, sure, ned.
I remember.

1124
01:17:49,235 --> 01:17:50,669
One good turn deserves another.
Come on, now.

1125
01:17:50,736 --> 01:17:52,571
Easy. I'll
get you home.

1126
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,647
I'm sorry, ned.

1127
01:18:06,713 --> 01:18:08,449
We should have gotten
together sooner.

1128
01:18:18,523 --> 01:18:19,691
Where are you
going, Jim?

1129
01:18:19,758 --> 01:18:21,191
Chasing the moon.

1130
01:18:21,258 --> 01:18:24,561
I hear there's a lot of new
territory out Arizona way.

1131
01:18:24,628 --> 01:18:26,428
Oklahoma's
practically new.

1132
01:18:26,495 --> 01:18:27,863
Couldn't you
just stay here?

1133
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:30,664
No, I don't like
the country around here.

1134
01:18:30,731 --> 01:18:31,999
Why, it's
beautiful country.

1135
01:18:32,066 --> 01:18:33,434
I know the scenery's
all right,

1136
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,736
except those
placards.

1137
01:18:35,803 --> 01:18:37,704
Every time I look at one
of those $500 insults,

1138
01:18:37,771 --> 01:18:39,304
I get madder and madder.
Get around!

1139
01:18:39,371 --> 01:18:41,640
But they're coming down.
Father says it.

1140
01:18:41,705 --> 01:18:44,408
Down or not, I'd always
remember where they'd been.

1141
01:18:44,475 --> 01:18:46,177
I understand.

1142
01:18:46,243 --> 01:18:48,911
A new country, a new leaf.

1143
01:18:48,978 --> 01:18:50,447
Me, turn over
a new leaf?

1144
01:18:50,514 --> 01:18:54,350
I'd have to turn over a
whole public library.

1145
01:18:54,416 --> 01:18:56,884
Well, after
you've done all that,

1146
01:18:56,951 --> 01:18:59,787
you think you'll ever,
ever be back this way again?

1147
01:18:59,852 --> 01:19:00,953
Well, maybe,
maybe not.

1148
01:19:01,021 --> 01:19:03,456
It all depends on the
way things turn out.

1149
01:19:03,521 --> 01:19:05,390
Well, good-bye, Jim.

1150
01:19:05,457 --> 01:19:07,291
Good-bye.

1151
01:19:08,893 --> 01:19:12,996
Jim, is Arizona
an awfully big place?

1152
01:19:13,063 --> 01:19:14,830
Yeah, yeah.
So they tell me.

1153
01:19:14,896 --> 01:19:17,332
Then I'll have a hard time
finding you, won't I?

1154
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,834
Look here, Jane, you don't
want to let yourself...

1155
01:19:19,901 --> 01:19:21,769
I just mean if you're empire-building,
it would save time...

1156
01:19:21,836 --> 01:19:23,237
Who said anything about
empire-building?

1157
01:19:23,304 --> 01:19:25,939
I just mean it's a difficult
thing to do by yourself.

1158
01:19:26,005 --> 01:19:28,040
For an empire,
you've got to have people.

1159
01:19:28,107 --> 01:19:29,640
For people, you've
got to have children,

1160
01:19:29,708 --> 01:19:31,041
and for children...

1161
01:19:31,108 --> 01:19:33,944
By authority as judge in the
crying need of this situation...

1162
01:19:34,011 --> 01:19:34,946
Just a minute,
judge, you...

1163
01:19:35,012 --> 01:19:36,545
Jane, do you take
this man to be your...

1164
01:19:36,613 --> 01:19:37,180
Yes, I do, dad.
Yes.

1165
01:19:37,247 --> 01:19:38,148
Just a minute...

1166
01:19:38,213 --> 01:19:39,582
Jim, do you take
this girl to be your...

1167
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:40,716
You don't want to get
yourself into this.

1168
01:19:40,782 --> 01:19:42,684
Takes me, father.
Whether likes it or not.

1169
01:19:42,751 --> 01:19:45,486
Very well, then.
I pronounce you...

1170
01:19:45,553 --> 01:19:46,455
Hold that hat.

1171
01:19:49,388 --> 01:19:50,824
Man and wife.
