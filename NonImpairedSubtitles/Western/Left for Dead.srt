1
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,397
Vengeance.

2
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,639
It is enough to keep you going
through anything-

3
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,869
through fear,

4
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,994
through pain,

5
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,278
through hell itself.

6
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,470
Because until you have
vengeance,

7
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,712
it has you.

8
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,793
And it won't let you go.

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,513
It won't let you live.

10
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,793
It won't even let you die.

11
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,358
You have something for me?

12
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,429
Answer the question,
señorita

13
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,279
Or do I use this ugly edge
on your pretty face?

14
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,156
Take it.

15
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,836
What are you hiding there?

16
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,038
I'm not looking
for trouble.

17
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,718
I'm looking for a man,
that's all.

18
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,355
Well...

19
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,196
look no farther.

20
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,438
I may be a woman,

21
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,870
but I'll be your man,
senorita

22
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,675
No.

23
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,230
You're not him.

24
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,518
You don't want to be,
neither,

25
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,113
'cause when I find him

26
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,078
I'm gonna
blow his balls off.

27
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,676
I came from Hell's Crossing.

28
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,276
They told me
to come this way...

29
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,318
said a Mary Black might be
looking for him too.

30
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,315
I thought I might help.

31
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,756
Mother Mary doesn't need your help.

32
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,278
A taste of what I got in that bundle
might change your mind.

33
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,519
No more, pl-

34
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,719
Take this offering
as communion with her,

35
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,439
Mother Lord.

36
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,789
I can guess what happened
to our two lookouts.

37
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,837
How about you tell
all of us who you are?

38
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,159
Clementine Templeton.

39
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,552
I'm looking for this man-

40
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,197
the same man I hear
y'all are looking for.

41
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,830
Maybe I can help you find
the son of a bitch.

42
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,959
Maybe you can.

43
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,070
So what's Sentenza to you?

44
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,680
Back home, he left a girl,

45
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,910
abandoned her.

46
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,994
Took all her money
and left her

47
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,993
with nothing but his baby
in her stomach.

48
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,118
This is my daughter
Michelle.

49
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,708
Sentenza fucked her,

50
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,837
left her like this.

51
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,315
He raped her?

52
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,033
Love sometimes makes you do things
you don't want to do.

53
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,833
You think what he did
to you was love?

54
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,358
They're on the same trail-

55
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,076
Mary Black,
her followers.

56
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,558
Their path started out
in a town ruled by women-

57
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,994
a way of life
threatened by a man.

58
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,872
Now they're afraid
of where the trail ends-

59
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,274
All of them are worried
that if the ghost stories are true,

60
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,189
the day of reckoning
with Mobius Lockhardt

61
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,396
awaits them.

62
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,795
The name's Rosa Hodge-
Sheriff Hodge to you and everyone else.

63
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,951
I uphold the law
in Hell's Crossing-

64
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,076
Mary's law.

65
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,516
Yeah, a town run by women.

66
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,749
We were through
waiting for men

67
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,513
to give us our rights.

68
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,073
Crack Shot, a fast shot.

69
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,353
One shot- that's all
Dora really needs.

70
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,192
Be glad you ain't
dueling with me.

71
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,476
Any gold you've got
or find, I get.

72
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,994
If you don't make it,
that is.

73
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,918
Name is Olie Almarich.

74
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,239
Lads call me Goldie.
See, I love gold.

75
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,710
I've heard there's a lot
of gold hidden in Amnesty,

76
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,432
scraps from back before
the mine was abandoned.

77
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,800
I intend to claim it all
for me and Mother Mary.

78
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,356
Quite the posse
you got here.

79
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,116
That girl
Sentenza left behind-

80
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,998
is she a relation of yours,

81
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,873
your sister?

82
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,633
How'd you come by
your skills?

83
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,034
My father Eli-

84
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,273
he had a ranch,

85
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,798
a dead Mexican wife
and three little girls.

86
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,875
For most of us
it's a vision.

87
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,759
For me, it was her,

88
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,510
bestowed on me
out of nowhere- Michelle.

89
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,715
Wait, so you're saying
your pregnancy was?

90
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,109
Immaculate.

91
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,793
You'll be lucky to survive one more
night before becoming a mother.

92
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,558
Mother Lord
will keep you well

93
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,278
long enough
to cleanse the sin

94
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,097
and see Blake Sentenza
pay for it.

95
00:08:47,132 --> 00:08:49,634
But, Mama, I don't
want him to pay.

96
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,548
This Sentenza-

97
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,075
he raped you, right?

98
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,359
He led you on

99
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,753
and he left you.

100
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,672
And you don't want him
to pay for it?

101
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,233
I don't want him
to pay for it with his life.

102
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,796
I'd just like him to say
that he still loves me.

103
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,718
What makes you think
he ever did?

104
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,680
Blake could have run away,
but he loves me too much to leave.

105
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,157
Why else would he stay
until a price was put on his head?

106
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,510
Where is it?

107
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,149
Where's the God damn town?

108
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,758
We need him alive.

109
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,634
Well, I figured it's best
to bring him back dead

110
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,592
than not bring him back at all.

111
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,636
A cemetery.
Lost souls, baby.

112
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,435
Just like
the ghost story says.

113
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,152
Amnesty Town.

114
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,350
If you figure
that's safer.

115
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,833
He come this way.

116
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,114
My hand!

117
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,590
Mobius Lockhardt-
a spirit of vengeance

118
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,757
left to roam this world
after death,

119
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,272
thirsty for blood,
hungry for revenge,

120
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,992
just like
the ghost story says.

121
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,189
Let's get the hell
out of here!

122
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,593
Stinking cowards.
Shooting at their own shadows.

123
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,910
Bushwhacking bastard.

124
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,469
Piece of shit shot my paw.

125
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,312
Let's shoot him
in the gut.

126
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,277
It takes days to die
from that.

127
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,674
It wasn't me.
I don't have a gun.

128
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,677
No no no no, please.
Don't, don't.

129
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,589
Please please please.

130
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,554
Don't shoot me, Mobius.
Just trying to take

131
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,196
a piece-of-shit
rapist back to justice.

132
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,075
Seeing as you've gone
so suddenly quiet,

133
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,073
I guess they call you
Blake Sentenza

134
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,350
Yeah.

135
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,678
Yeah, but I didn't
rape that girl.

136
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,912
Very few live
to tell their story

137
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,672
about this camp,

138
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,958
about me.
You could be one of them,

139
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,278
but it means doing
something in exchange.

140
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,554
Great. Great.

141
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,996
Very few get to live.

142
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,793
Deliver a message for me...

143
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,668
...about me.

144
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,077
That's so you don't forget.

145
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,634
Señor Sentenza.

146
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,875
A holy servant once
said to God,

147
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,800
"My life was filled
with pain and suffering

148
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,673
and ended
in horrible tragedy.

149
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,795
I renounce you
and my place in Your kingdom."

150
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,831
And God said
to the servant,

151
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,953
"Then your suffering
shall continue

152
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,109
in the service of Satan
and your reward will be

153
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,595
a place in Amnesty."

154
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,314
And therewith,
Mobius Lockhardt...

155
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,829
...rose from the grave
to serve a new lifetime...

156
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,635
...bringing souls
of the damned to hell.

157
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,393
I didn't rape that girl.

158
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,788
Many people come here
looking for something,

159
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,028
some for gold,

160
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,174
others for a refuge,

161
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:04,709
land, maybe even me.

162
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,754
But all any of them
ever get

163
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,473
is their epitaph.

164
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,553
And now, now they'll be
coming here for you,

165
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,033
Blake Sentenza

166
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,588
You know...

167
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,079
that's my last cigarette.

168
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,073
I don't want
to puff it alone.

169
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,674
Been years,

170
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,708
15 of them
since I last had one.

171
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,439
It's a friendly gesture.

172
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,397
Been 15

173
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,992
since I had
one of those too- a friend.

174
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,554
Most chant Bible at me
and run away.

175
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,311
I know his belly's
torn to pieces,

176
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,398
but he still looks lively.

177
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,750
You can see him twitching.

178
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,751
Takes days to die
from a stomach wound.

179
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,032
I also have a lady.

180
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,759
Left her back east

181
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,071
for the gold rush.

182
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,713
Mine's dead.

183
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,110
Maybe it's time I gave you

184
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,635
a friendly gesture.

185
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,078
This devil hoard was forged
with hellfire.

186
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,389
A Dixie roll.
I've seen the trick.

187
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,756
You catch it,
you twirl it around

188
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,270
and blow me to hell.

189
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,516
Maybe you're already there.

190
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,671
I'm sorry. I was just trying
to be friendly.

191
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,550
I give myself to Lucifer!

192
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,438
This grave was dug today.

193
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,556
We should have burnt it to the ground.

194
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,233
Looks like somebody's
fiancee is trying to scare us.

195
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,988
- Run us the hell off.
- Shh. Listen.

196
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,590
Now we know what happened
to our bounty hunters.

197
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,716
No.
Blake didn't do this.

198
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,792
No, he isn't vicious like this.
He isn't-

199
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,798
Don't get on your knees for him.
Not for him!

200
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,559
Never do that for a man.

201
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,998
Go. Go back. Go.

202
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,996
He's dead.

203
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,712
He killed Sentenza.

204
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,077
I heard the shot.

205
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,874
Blake's dead?

206
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,270
Please save me.

207
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,238
Blake's not dead.
This heathen was

208
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,476
just too scared
to face him again.

209
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,589
Think of this piece of shit
before you fail me.

210
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,109
Give me your gold, cowboy.

211
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,516
Good taste, picking me.

212
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,077
Slim pickings, but you would be
my first stop too.

213
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,396
I chose you because
I know what you're after.

214
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,157
And you know
what I'm after.

215
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,555
You're after him?
Sentenza?

216
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,999
Any gold goes to you,

217
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,878
big payola or otherwise.

218
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,629
I expect the same
in return

219
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,474
if you find
what I'm looking for.

220
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,516
Huh-uh, I'm going this way.

221
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,751
Your ass is mine, Blake.

222
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,759
Been here long enough?

223
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,755
There's only two places
you can be safe

224
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,309
from Mobius Lockhardt-
beyond the graves

225
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,629
and inside this church.

226
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,560
I'm sorry I scared you.
I thought you were one of them.

227
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,359
Know what I came here for?

228
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,159
You came to save me.

229
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,989
All right.

230
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,077
Give me one reason not to.

231
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,674
I just did.

232
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,078
Need another kiss?
Want some more?

233
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,479
You'd better try another reason.

234
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,879
All right.

235
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,198
That's your
wedding dress, right?

236
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,634
Been patching it up.

237
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,993
After what you did,

238
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,870
you and me, I don't think
that can be patched up.

239
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,994
It's about the girl, right?

240
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,715
It's all lies, Clem.

241
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,833
I didn't spend
any time with her,

242
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,519
not even words.

243
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,668
I only love you,

244
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,555
with my eyes,

245
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,829
with my heart.

246
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,074
I'm all yours.

247
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,199
Then where's your ring?

248
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,113
Where's yours?

249
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,673
- Hey hey.
- So where is your ring?

250
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,593
I was just sweet-talking him
so I could bring him out nice and easy.

251
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,869
A punch would do it.

252
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,272
One punch from... you?

253
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,316
Are you prepared
to make good

254
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,994
on your promise
to my little girl, Blake?

255
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,118
You fucking whore.

256
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,473
Each time you say "No"...

257
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,233
we pull the hook.

258
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,028
We'll let you hang until the skin
peels clean off your bones.

259
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,669
Ever seen a man's bones
slide out of his flesh?

260
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,389
Even for you,
I don't know

261
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,596
if I can stand
to watch it happen again.

262
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,112
Lucky I don't have that problem.

263
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,992
You can put it
on my finger now,

264
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,434
like you always said.

265
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,874
Don't let them hurt you
like this, Blake.

266
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,955
You're crazy.
That's because your lover boy

267
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,396
hasn't slipped it on you
or because he slipped it on hers.

268
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,030
That badge don't place you
above nobody.

269
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,154
You're just one of Mary Black's
teet suckers.

270
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,035
We'll see who
a teet sucker is shortly.

271
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,951
You raped my daughter

272
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,640
and you left the mark
of your perversion

273
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:44,870
in her belly, you bastard.

274
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,397
I didn't do it!

275
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,275
If I have to,

276
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,799
I will baptize this baby
in your blood.

277
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,274
Just say "I do"

278
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,349
Say you love me.
Please say it like before,

279
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,954
or they'll make it hurt.

280
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,672
Never said that.
Never felt that.

281
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,758
And nothing can make me.

282
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,234
Nothing?

283
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,232
Are you sure about that?

284
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,235
Clementine.

285
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,715
We believe to do unto others
what is done to us.

286
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,630
- An eye for an eye.
- An eye for an eye.

287
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,109
- A tooth for a tooth.
- A tooth for a tooth.

288
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,309
A rape for a rape.

289
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,116
This your idea of law?

290
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,232
Mary's will is the law.

291
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,273
Spit out the words, Blake,
the ones I want to hear.

292
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,956
Then I'll say the ones
that you want to hear.

293
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,477
Listen, Mary,
all the stories are true

294
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,434
about Mobius.
They are true.

295
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,679
He's just been waiting for us
to come out of the church.

296
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,592
There is no Mobius.

297
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,792
She doesn't have time.

298
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,919
Any gold is mine

299
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,752
and I'm taking
what's mine.

300
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,911
Hiding your gold
wedding ring from me, huh?

301
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,759
I knew you'd want a piece
of what was down this shirt.

302
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,119
This is fool's gold,

303
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,554
like the one Sentenza
gave Michelle.

304
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,719
Clementine Templeton...

305
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,594
Always had trouble dropping
the maiden name, Madre.

306
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,759
...it's a sin for a bride

307
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,359
to share her spouse
with another.

308
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,397
Well, then you'd better
tell your girl

309
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,352
to find another man
to walk that aisle,

310
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,550
'cause I'm hitched
to the one hooked up!

311
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,752
I'll see what I can do
about issuing a divorce.

312
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,393
It's Mobius.

313
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,034
- Michelle.
- Please, no!

314
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,672
- Blake!
- Come!

315
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,759
That's what it feels Like
being the broadside of a barn.

316
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,911
Not a thing can stop him.

317
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,595
You didn't even hit him
with a single slug, crack shot.

318
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,838
Told you it will take
experience.

319
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,359
If anyone can put
the bastard down, I can.

320
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,550
Dirty little lass.

321
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,715
Blake.

322
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,756
Hold on.
Hold on.

323
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,279
Dora, what are you
waiting for?

324
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,038
- You all right?
- Yeah.

325
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,354
We've got to
get out of here.

326
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,594
I don't know if I should
save your neck or stretch it out.

327
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,159
Shoot him, Dora, shoot!

328
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,394
Come on.

329
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,197
Mama, wait wait.

330
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,595
No!

331
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,911
Please, don't shoot.

332
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,670
I'm nothing,
harmless without my gun.

333
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,509
Well, what were you
with them?

334
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,836
Forgotten your past?

335
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,429
Mobius.

336
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,875
Your past hasn't
forgotten you.

337
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,913
It's not fair.

338
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,550
I haven't got my calling yet.
I was supposed to see.

339
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,037
Hell, you are lucky,
sister.

340
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,833
Oh, Lord.

341
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,315
Most don't want
to see it coming.

342
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,875
But since you can't see,

343
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,720
I want you to listen
real close.

344
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,518
Mama, I thought you couldn't
come into this place.

345
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,271
Oh, isn't this just cozy?

346
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,999
Are you okay?

347
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,592
Didn't hear me?

348
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,550
Nobody with the whore
leaves here alive.

349
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,437
So where were you
going, Sheriff?

350
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,873
I can't get used to it,
that sound.

351
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,119
Well, you'd better
get used to it.

352
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,559
I believe I remember you

353
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,434
back in the old days,

354
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,799
still full of
grit and spit, Rosa

355
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,714
But now

356
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,114
I've got something
for you to chew on.

357
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,276
Mother Lord
will show us the way.

358
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,593
I'd rather put my faith

359
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,597
in someone that actually
exists, Madre.

360
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,475
Like that other girl
Blake left behind,

361
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,678
the one you said was
abandoned and pregnant?

362
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,119
What are you
talking about?

363
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,870
I didn't leave
any girl pregnant.

364
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,239
Me.

365
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,993
You're kidding, right?

366
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,714
We tried all those times.

367
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,869
You said that-

368
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,839
I thought
you couldn't carry.

369
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,399
Well, I guess that night
before you left

370
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,033
was the lucky number.

371
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,232
You're not shaped
like you're pregnant.

372
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,069
If what you say is true,

373
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,833
then- then where is
the baby?

374
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,236
Right, where is it?

375
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,279
You lost it, didn't you?

376
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,077
I hadn't heard from Blake,
so I took off for him.

377
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,553
But the fights
slowed me bad.

378
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,235
The worst one came from
some boys in grey dusters.

379
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,239
Grey dusters?

380
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,113
That means-

381
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,553
Those bastards.

382
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,077
The beating sidelined me
for months.

383
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,151
I had aches

384
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,477
in bones I never
even knew existed...

385
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,439
blood dripping
from places

386
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,033
that it shouldn't
have been.

387
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,032
But I survived.

388
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,038
I wanted you
to meet your son, Blake.

389
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,069
I was gonna name him Eli,

390
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,669
after my father.

391
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,639
They deserve to die...

392
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,750
suffer horribly

393
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,639
and then die.

394
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,832
They should all die...

395
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,919
just that way.

396
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,273
They did.

397
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,195
They all did.

398
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,997
If I'd known, I would have came back.
You know that.

399
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,390
What happened to your ring?

400
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,515
I lost it.

401
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,912
After I lost the money you gave me
for the trip to Sonora

402
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,036
You didn't quite make it
to the gold rush.

403
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,993
I had to stop off
in Hell's Crossing

404
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,558
and earn some money
to make it the rest of the way.

405
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,791
It wasn't all
you stopped off for.

406
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,870
No. No! No!

407
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,034
No!

408
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,392
If you wouldn't have forced me
to look for gold,

409
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,395
this never would have happened.

410
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,197
You needed to stand
on your own two feet

411
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,478
instead of stepping on mine
all the time!

412
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,235
I'm sorry you had to pay my debts...

413
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,831
and had to support me.
I'm sorry.

414
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,035
I will always be thankful.

415
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,998
But there's nothing I can do
to change it.

416
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,030
Nothing.

417
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,390
Why her?

418
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,195
I am a man.

419
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,518
We're not built
for just one woman.

420
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,994
That's the problem.

421
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,236
Here, you need me
to fix the problem?

422
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,068
Be careful Clem.

423
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,276
Why her, huh? Why?

424
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,709
She needed me.

425
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,434
I never felt you did.

426
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,154
It was nice, Clem.

427
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,679
She wears dresses.

428
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,748
The only dress you ever wore
is the one you got on now.

429
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,034
And after all...

430
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,395
After all, Clem

431
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,749
I've never loved her.

432
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,790
Then why did you stick
so close to her, huh,

433
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,718
instead of getting away
and coming back to me?

434
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,833
I was waiting for the baby...

435
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,074
...for the baby.

436
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,632
I wanted to take him as
soon as he was delivered.

437
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,951
You've seen her Clem,
she's too weak to raise a child.

438
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:48,676
I just wanted to bring back

439
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,308
something better than gold for you.

440
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,839
That's it.

441
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,598
Found what you're
looking for?

442
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,719
I give up.

443
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,472
I give up.
I'm sorry.

444
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,716
I'm not like the others.
I'm not like Mary.

445
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,755
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

446
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,038
- Want a smoke?
- A friendly gesture?

447
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,511
Yeah, sure sure.

448
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,794
Here.

449
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,518
Mobius.
Mobius.

450
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,839
Is it over?

451
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,994
Is it, Mama?

452
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,794
Here you go.

453
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:41,830
He's gone.

454
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,270
It's my gold!

455
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,354
Hey, everybody,
come out!

456
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,837
Olie killed the ghost!

457
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,432
I stabbed him
in the stomach,

458
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,949
like the legend says.
He's dead.

459
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,475
He's dead!

460
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,079
I don't know.

461
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,273
You don't think he's dead?

462
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,879
No.

463
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,276
You can have this back.

464
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,191
I thought you were dead!

465
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,832
You must really hate me.

466
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,912
I got us into this.

467
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,432
Messed around with Blake
when you swore him off.

468
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,472
I'm not the one
that hates you.

469
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,794
Who are you talking about?

470
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,995
Blake doesn't hate me.

471
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,757
Your father hated you...

472
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,636
for what you
remind him of-

473
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,038
of me.

474
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,029
My father?
I don't have a father.

475
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,992
You said I never had
a father.

476
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,071
You're putting too much
stress on the baby.

477
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,835
That's it.

478
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,239
Remember that time-

479
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,752
that time we went fishing
at Eagle Creek?

480
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:16,631
Yeah.

481
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,795
We used all sorts of bait-

482
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:21,396
bread, sardine, minnow,

483
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,398
but the fish didn't care.

484
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,757
They just let that stuff
float on down the stream.

485
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,918
Just takes
the right bait.

486
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,552
Mary- she's the bait.

487
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,189
And we're the stuff that
floats on down the stream.

488
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,913
My father was a preacher?

489
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,032
He made bad places good,

490
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,760
swore never to leave them
until they were,

491
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,511
even tried to tame

492
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,717
a wild mining town
called Amnesty

493
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,029
with faith

494
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,398
and not with force.

495
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,478
Your father sinned

496
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,717
when he fell in love
with me,

497
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,431
when he made love to me.

498
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,955
He had a wife
waiting at home for him.

499
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,429
And everyone found out

500
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,118
when out of the blue
she turned up in Amnesty.

501
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,789
Mama?

502
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,312
It was in that bad time

503
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,834
that I had a vision.

504
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,353
Mother Lord told me
what I had to do.

505
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,275
I banded
all the women together...

506
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,195
and we put Amnesty
to death.

507
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,991
- Mobius!
- Marisol!

508
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,351
No more, please.

509
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,398
Please, no more.
Please.

510
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,472
Keep what you took from me.

511
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,912
Let's trade.

512
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,955
Mother Lord
show you a way yet?

513
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,834
- What's your plan?
- Mobius can't be stopped,

514
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,751
but Olie showed us
we can slow him down.

515
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,634
- Right.
- I can keep Mobius busy from here

516
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,836
and give you enough time
to get to the bridge and out of here.

517
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,789
Blake...

518
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,356
take this.

519
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,713
Once you reach
the front gates,

520
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,520
be sure to hit Mobius
with enough trigger music

521
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,715
so I can join you.

522
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,879
Mary here will be
going out first.

523
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,193
Why am I to be first?

524
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,912
Blake and Michelle
are going out after you.

525
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,712
She needs his help
getting away.

526
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,754
If I'm covering his ass,

527
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,349
I'm covering hers.

528
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,988
Keeps it all honest,
wouldn't you say?

529
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,716
Coin flips both ways.

530
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,398
You could go first.
I could go last.

531
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,355
Being last means
trusting Blake and me

532
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,678
to help you out
once we're at the gates.

533
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,000
Besides,
you're in a bad way.

534
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,434
You need a puff
of Mother Lord soon enough

535
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,397
or you won't be
no use to anyone.

536
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,518
Are you ready
to carry your bride

537
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,113
across the threshold?

538
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,349
Let's go.

539
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,188
Just in case
we don't make it,

540
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,920
maybe we should all
cleanse our souls.

541
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,992
Anything to confess,
Blake?

542
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,399
He didn't rape me.

543
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,989
Blake didn't do anything.

544
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,355
Well, other than
what I begged him to do.

545
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,590
You slut!

546
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,909
I just thought

547
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,592
if she forced him
to marry me,

548
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,637
it would force him
to love me.

549
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,552
The look
Blake gives you-

550
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,673
he never lent me
a stare like that.

551
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,509
Oh, no,
he's after Mama.

552
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,911
Hey, it's better
that you don't see this.

553
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,233
Whore.

554
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,592
Is it working?

555
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,320
Yeah, it is working.

556
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,113
Go on, Blake, now!

557
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,069
Right.

558
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,551
Now it's time
to let the bait

559
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,954
slip right off the hook.

560
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,554
They screwed you.

561
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,950
You should be
used to that by now.

562
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,235
Can't blame them for putting some
bullets in you.

563
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,955
I sure am glad
they saved

564
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,519
the last ones for me.

565
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,276
I want to hear you beg.

566
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,474
Wait wait wait,
where's Mama?

567
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,631
- I can't leave her.
- Shh.

568
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,989
Keep looking for her
and all you'll see is

569
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,117
the bastard's gun
in your face.

570
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,830
All right?

571
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,113
Don't go too far.

572
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,235
It's hurting me awful!

573
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:23,754
We have to keep moving.

574
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,671
So I see that you're
a whore's daughter.

575
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,636
Don't call her that,
you son of a bitch!

576
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,434
Didn't tell you, did she?

577
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,874
Your mother was a whore,

578
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,236
the biggest one
in this town Amnesty.

579
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:06,590
Every man took a dip
or two or three

580
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,790
in your mom and
your mom's little whores-

581
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,518
Rosa, Cota,

582
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,148
the whole slutty bunch.

583
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,952
Couldn't you
smell it on her?

584
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,477
You never lose that stink,

585
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,478
whore stench.

586
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,518
Some of that smell
rubbed off on you, little girl.

587
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,714
Tempting married men
just like your mom,

588
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,836
just like the whore
you are, huh?

589
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,028
That collar-
my father wore one.

590
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,469
You killed him.

591
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,193
Did you steal it
from him?

592
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,310
Is that his?

593
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,029
Yes,

594
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,471
it belonged to your father.

595
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:19,355
All right. It won't do
much good anyhow.

596
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,070
Think I won't shoot you
because you aren't armed?

597
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:29,000
I think you won't
pull a trigger on a friend,

598
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,316
even if he stands
between you and revenge.

599
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:57,955
There.
Now I don't have a friend

600
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,431
standing between me
and revenge.

601
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,996
His gun!
It hurt him!

602
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,951
Blake, are you all right?

603
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,429
Sometimes the answers
aren't so easy.

604
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,758
How do you think I feel?

605
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,358
You didn't even see
the end.

606
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,759
I wish I could see
anything else,

607
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,713
but those sights are burned
deep into my eyeballs.

608
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,552
I made his wish come true.

609
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,873
I gave him
something else to see.

610
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:04,829
Michelle, that's it.

611
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:05,910
Everything's
gonna be fine.

612
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:26,716
Feels like life

613
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:30,198
is being squeezed
out of me.

614
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,115
We aren't gonna make it
to the front gates.

615
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,273
Hey, try to stand up.

616
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:37,829
Okay, now follow me.

617
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,513
I can't make it.

618
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,236
Just leave me behind.
Oh, God.

619
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:52,910
Keep on yelling
like this

620
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,349
and Mobius won't need eyes
to find us.

621
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,551
Haven't you heard
the stories?

622
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,990
Nobody leaves here alive
unless I let them.

623
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,430
I'm sure as hell
not letting you go

624
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,555
this time.

625
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,352
It hurts!

626
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,077
Shut her up, damn it.
We've got problems.

627
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,391
Shh.
Come on, shh.

628
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,750
Come on, come on, come on.

629
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,348
Breathe breathe breathe.

630
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:30,599
Shh. Shh, breathe.

631
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:46,754
Is my mom dead?

632
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,310
Come on, Clem,

633
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,116
you can tell me.

634
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:54,550
I don't care.

635
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,514
Is it wrong
if I feel like this?

636
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,628
It'd be wrong
if you didn't.

637
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,390
Sounds like
she treated you awful.

638
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,632
Your mom's dead, hon.

639
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:23,631
It's okay.

640
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:27,156
Shh. Shh. Shh.

641
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:30,990
It's okay.

642
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,152
These tears
are not for her.

643
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,749
They're for me.

644
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,234
Because now I won't know

645
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,590
how if feels to have
a mother, you know.

646
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:51,750
I feel like
I'll never know

647
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,478
what it'd be like
to be one.

648
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,312
Maybe it'd be like this.

649
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:13,276
Take this.

650
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:15,073
No, I can't.

651
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,719
He promised
to get me away from here,

652
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,590
out of Hell's Crossing.

653
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,394
I loved him.

654
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:31,589
But he loves you.

655
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,752
Thank you.

656
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:43,990
Oh, God.

657
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:49,673
Take this.

658
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,512
There's about three
sheets left, okay?

659
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,834
Save it for when
you're in the peaks.

660
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,831
Don't waste it all
on the valleys.

661
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:58,788
Shh. Shh.

662
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:03,991
Where's Blake?

663
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,398
Why? Where are you going?
We still have to help Michelle

664
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,752
push that baby out.

665
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,349
How long did it take

666
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,953
for my wife
to bleed to death?

667
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,399
I asked you a question.

668
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:42,436
How long did it take
for her to die?

669
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,352
Do you remember my wife?

670
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,711
I don't know.

671
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,550
Shh. Shh.

672
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:06,270
You'd better polish off
that bald face I gave you.

673
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,673
Maybe we should save it

674
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,592
for the next one,
the next peak.

675
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:13,716
Michelle, honey,

676
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,351
you ain't headed back
to the valley, okay?

677
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,399
Come on.

678
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,231
Quiet down.
Quiet down.

679
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,598
Okay, hold on.

680
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:36,637
Bite down, bite down.
Bite down hard.

681
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,151
Okay, come on, Michelle.
Keep it going.

682
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,953
Are you ready?
Let's start pushing.

683
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:43,157
Start pushing.
Come on, push.

684
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,753
Push hard, come on.

685
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:47,717
Blake, it's time.
Get up the chute.

686
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,313
Come on,
get down at the chute.

687
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,874
No. You go down.
Women are more used to this.

688
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,077
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're the one

689
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,316
that broke the saddle, you stud.
So get your ass down there.

690
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,352
You see anything yet?

691
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,194
Quiet down.
Quiet down, okay?

692
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,671
- I'm here. Quiet down.
- I can see his head.

693
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,036
I'm gonna need
one more big push, okay?

694
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:10,276
Yeah?

695
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,189
Let's go, okay?

696
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,509
One, two, three, go.

697
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,029
I'll get you
nice and pretty

698
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,958
for the next customer.

699
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,792
How can I make him quite?
Mobius will hear us.

700
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,633
Looks like you have
a baby boy.

701
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,508
He kind of looks
like you, Blake.

702
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:47,309
Blake...

703
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,230
take Michelle and the baby.

704
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,235
Take him.

705
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,955
Run out of here.
I can't raise him.

706
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:59,991
You have the time
it takes me

707
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:01,873
to spend nine slugs.

708
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:04,071
Okay?

709
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,395
No Clem.

710
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,229
I don't want to do it.
I can't do it.

711
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:10,954
There must be another way.

712
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,839
Please.
You feel that?

713
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,550
It's my grip, all right?

714
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:17,999
I'm holding you now.

715
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:00,909
This don't seem fair.

716
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,868
Yeah, it don't seem fair.

717
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,039
Was that one of hers?

718
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:10,795
Yeah.

719
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,758
It was her tenth shot.

720
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,232
Now your shooting arm

721
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,159
is just as ugly as mine.

722
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:41,308
Fair would be giving me
one of your shooters.

723
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,676
They call this a Dixie roll.

724
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:16,551
Blake.

725
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:18,476
No. No!

726
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:01,073
You looking for this, hoss?

727
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,359
I never asked anyone
for help,

728
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:07,509
but I asked then.

729
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,917
What good has God
done for me, though?

730
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,029
He gave you another chance.

731
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:14,555
By stranding me in this camp
that I can't leave,

732
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:16,193
with that whore
still alive?

733
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:17,629
After all the corpses
you put in the ground,

734
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,751
no wonder you don't
step in that church.

735
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,394
Everything was
taken away from me, you'll see.

736
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:27,113
So tell me,
what would you do

737
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,157
if the same thing
happened to you?

738
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:32,391
You wouldn't turn this whole world into
one big graveyard?

739
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:33,716
Who do you think that is

740
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,193
lying on the ground
over there?

741
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,119
He's everything to me.

742
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:42,435
And I'm just putting one corpse
in the ground for it- you.

743
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,912
God, I fucking hate you!

744
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:00,715
I renounce you!

745
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,438
I renounce Christ!

746
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:05,912
I give myself to Lucifer!

747
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:15,915
Go on.

748
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,592
There's nothing left to see.

749
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:52,271
Hey hey hey.

750
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:54,839
You didn't believe me.

751
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:56,989
I told you.

752
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:00,314
I just wanted to leave with you.

753
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:05,232
Is there anything else
I can do?

754
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:06,715
Yeah.

755
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,472
Take me to the doctor.

756
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:11,388
To a med?

757
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:13,156
But you're shot bad.

758
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:14,799
I don't think you're gonna
make it there.

759
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,749
Don't worry, baby.

760
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:20,309
The belly

761
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:23,950
is the most painful spot
to take a shot,

762
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:27,074
but it takes days
to die from it.

763
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:50,079
Vengeance.

764
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,318
It is enough to keep
you going through anything-

765
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:53,916
through fear,

766
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:56,070
through pain,

767
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:58,071
through hell itself.

768
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,397
Because until you have
vengeance,

769
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,270
it has you,

770
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,153
and it won't let you go.
