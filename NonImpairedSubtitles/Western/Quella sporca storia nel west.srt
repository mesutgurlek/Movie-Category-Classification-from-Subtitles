1
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,028
Father!

2
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,434
Father!

3
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:27,874
To sleep... to die...
No, to sleep!

4
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,318
Perchance to dream!
There's the rub!

5
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,076
To be, or not to be:
That is the question...

6
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,072
Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to suffer...

7
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,391
The slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune...

8
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,959
Or to take arms against
a sea of troubles...

9
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:58,434
And by opposing end them?
To die, to sleep...

10
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,519
No more!

11
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,196
And by a sleep...

12
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,919
- And by a sleep to say we end...
- Father...

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,753
- Father...
- That's strange...

14
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,476
The ones returning
from war...

15
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,394
...usually have the names
of women on their lips.

16
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,434
This one's got nothing better on
his mind than calling for his father.

17
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,034
Right. And who knows
if he even has a father.

18
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,838
I mean a real father.

19
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,992
Who fosters and protects you,
who gives you a home.

20
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,594
I don't think he has
a father like that.

21
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,592
Otherwise, he wouldn't be sleeping
under the wagon of some performers.

22
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,875
Ah, war only harms.

23
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,996
And you? Have you learned
this damned role already?

24
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,638
I'm rehearsing it
right now!

25
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,792
Listen, if you blow your lines
tonight I'll cut your meals!

26
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,874
Hey!

27
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,913
Soldier.

28
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,919
Wake up.

29
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,119
You've been sleeping
since last evening.

30
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,591
Where are you from?
Who are you?

31
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,591
Don't you want
to tell me?

32
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,232
A secret...

33
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,516
You're strange.

34
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,270
For who would bear the whips
and scorns of time.

35
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,796
The oppressor's wrong,
the proud man's contumely...

36
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,472
The pangs of
despised love...

37
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,039
The pangs of
despised love!

38
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,510
For who would bear the whips
and scorns of time...

39
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,279
Why did he shoot?

40
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,510
I don't get it...
Who are they?

41
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,715
That's Butch Warren, isn't it?

42
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,148
- And what did he want from us?
- Those rogues hardly rode that far...

43
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,196
...just to rob
some poor performers.

44
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,714
Thank God, that soldier
is a good shot!

45
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,472
- Thanks a lot, anyway...
- Look, he's leaving!

46
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,917
Now what?
You're running off?

47
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,554
Hey hero!

48
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,235
JOHNNY HAMLET

49
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,509
Hey.

50
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,475
There... The dream
didn't fool me.

51
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,473
"Willfully murdered".

52
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,229
But who did it?
Who?

53
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,428
Maybe someone
he hated.

54
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,470
Relative of yours?

55
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,274
My father.

56
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,240
All the tears on earth aren't enough
to cry for a man like you.

57
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,597
And me?
Why wasn't I here?

58
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,558
Where was I when
they killed you?

59
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,677
So far away from my home,
from my land... for such a long time.

60
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,914
Defending a flag, a piece
of honorable cloth.

61
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,915
Instead of protecting my father,
my own flesh, my own blood!

62
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,310
Did he call my name
in that very moment?

63
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,636
Like in that dream?

64
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,229
A good man, Hamilton.
A man of honor.

65
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,794
Hey!

66
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,191
Watch out, gravedigger!

67
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,034
If you soil my shoes, I'll make you
clean them with your tongue.

68
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,918
And try not to make
any noise when you dig!

69
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,437
Can't you see, you're disturbing the
pious souls who come here to pray?

70
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,876
Am I right, Ross?

71
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,749
Hey General!

72
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,351
What are you doing here?
Are you looking for a grave?

73
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,476
Huh? Yours?

74
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,149
I have to warn you, my friend
doesn't like uniforms that much.

75
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,198
Am I right, Guild?

76
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,875
Even worse! An uniform like
this one could make me angry...

77
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,428
...like the
red rag to a bull.

78
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,472
Olé, toro!

79
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,639
Hey Guild.

80
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,230
What do you think
about those heros...

81
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,993
...who instead of dying
on the battlefield...

82
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,356
...end up on the cemetery,
draped with medals?

83
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,475
Huh?

84
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,598
Hey you, gravedigger!
Come on, let's go!

85
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,711
Dig a grave...
for this heroic general!

86
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,631
I'll take care...
of the corpse.

87
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,951
Hey! What should we
engrave on the tombstone?

88
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,039
You've laughed three
times already, my friend.

89
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,389
The next laugher
could be your last.

90
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,034
Don't you see that
I'm trembling with fear?

91
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,557
Damn it, I've never
seen you shaking like this!

92
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,715
Get lost, you two!

93
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,829
I don't like talking to someone
who shoots from behind.

94
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,312
You're right, Ross.

95
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,230
My father used to say...

96
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,629
...amateurs never confront
you with the muzzle.

97
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,998
Then get lost quick before I...
get to the professional part.

98
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,478
Very good, yes. Make a nice face.
Hey, no! Not on the grip...

99
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,676
It's more hygienic
on the barrel.

100
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,108
Exactly!
Very good...

101
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,757
Hey you!
Get out!

102
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,229
Can't you see that
they're two good boys?

103
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,633
Too bad...

104
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,036
That was a wine that
could have awoken the dead.

105
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,271
That's what they say.

106
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,675
Until next time,
my friend.

107
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,396
- We'll see each other again.
- Whenever you like.

108
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,552
Thanks, Horaz.

109
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,879
You're welcome, Johnny.

110
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,315
You always show up
in the right moment.

111
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,391
Like back then,
when I was a little boy.

112
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,190
You've become
a man, Johnny.

113
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,316
And you seem
to be alright.

114
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,875
It was about time
for you to come back.

115
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,316
I need your help.

116
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,318
I want to know
who killed my father.

117
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,676
- And you have to tell me.
- I don't know.

118
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,795
I was told,
it was Santana.

119
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,916
That's what they said.
But I...

120
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,513
...I don't know.

121
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,714
They also said your
uncle avenged him.

122
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,872
Santana lies over there.

123
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,878
I wouldn't have even wasted
a grave for a bandit like him.

124
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,553
And my mother?

125
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,557
She suffered.

126
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,397
She's still
on the ranch.

127
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,708
Gertie!

128
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,234
Are you over there?
What are you doing?

129
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,799
I'm there in a minute.

130
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,077
Satisfied with the party?

131
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,639
Ah, good.
You're an outstanding landlady.

132
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,749
What?

133
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,712
No, fool!

134
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,792
Come here!
I command you to!

135
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,758
The wife has to obey the husband!
And if she doesn't listen...

136
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,119
...the husband beats her up!
- No! I obey! I obey!

137
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,237
Oh sweetheart...

138
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,794
Who's there?

139
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,595
Johnny!

140
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,714
Johnny!

141
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,433
Oh Johnny...

142
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,839
Two years...

143
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,478
Two years of
that horrible war.

144
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,989
Why did you
marry my uncle?

145
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,910
Do you know what
happened to your father?

146
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:49,590
When they killed him,
I felt like I had to die of pain.

147
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,797
A short pain.

148
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,553
You didn't let
his bed cool down!

149
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,716
You mustn't talk
to me like this!

150
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,393
That's true.

151
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,630
You're the landlady here.

152
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,791
You're the wife of your
husband's brother.

153
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,794
And you're still...
my mother.

154
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,239
Yes... your mother.

155
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,074
But Johnny, you're
not a little boy anymore.

156
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,916
And I'm a woman.

157
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,152
And so alone.

158
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,118
If your uncle
hadn't been there...

159
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,112
...they would have taken everything away.
Do you understand? Everything!

160
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,637
Sure, sure.

161
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,238
So... uncle Claude
saved everything.

162
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,000
And in exchange,
took everything for himself.

163
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,954
Yes...

164
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,233
- Also the caresses of my mother!
- Johnny!

165
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,796
You're embittered
of pain.

166
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,634
Why don't you want
to understand me?

167
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,917
Your mother is right.

168
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,513
Johnny!
Welcome home.

169
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,479
Johnny!

170
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,711
Hello, Johnny!

171
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,719
For how long have I
been waiting for you?

172
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,712
Too long.

173
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,716
Don't talk now.

174
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,079
Emily...

175
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,553
What are you doing?
Emily!

176
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,279
You shouldn't
have left, Johnny.

177
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,035
You shouldn't
have left me.

178
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,634
But now...

179
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,158
Now I'm here.

180
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,636
And everything will be
the way it used to be.

181
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,908
A lot has happened.
Lots of bad things.

182
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,190
And nothing could be
the way it was.

183
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,349
What do you know?

184
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,829
What can you tell me
about my father?

185
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,874
Don't ask me, Johnny.
I'm begging you.

186
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,314
I don't want to talk about it.
And it's also better for you.

187
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,839
But I have to.

188
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,958
Did you tell your
father that I'm back?

189
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,314
No, Johnny!

190
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,030
I'm also not the same person
I was back then anymore.

191
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,628
- That's enough!
- Johnny!

192
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,835
- Tell me what happened!
- No!

193
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,751
I want to know what
they have done to you!

194
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,796
- Johnny, go!
- Come on, talk!

195
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,279
Tell me who
killed my father!

196
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,920
- Save yourself, Johnny! Go away!
- What do you know? What did you see?

197
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,479
- No, I don't know anything.
- Talk!

198
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,436
I don't know
anything, Johnny!

199
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,192
- Talk!
- Hey General!

200
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,317
Is that the way you treat
the sheriff's daughter?

201
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,555
Her father's
the sheriff now.

202
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,631
And you're asking that girl
too many questions.

203
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,030
How can you demand
that she answers you?

204
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,552
- If she can't answer...
- Go, Johnny.

205
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,315
...somebody else will
answer my questions.

206
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,994
- Is that so?
- Go!

207
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,271
But that wouldn't
be good for you.

208
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,511
Did you see, my lovely?

209
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,715
You've been warned.

210
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,795
These are dangerous acquaintances.
Even for the daughter of the sheriff.

211
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,188
Want some help?

212
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,429
Whoops!

213
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,159
Get up!

214
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,754
Olé!

215
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,115
That's for you!

216
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,556
Come on!
Let's go!

217
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,394
Stop it!

218
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,390
Get lost, you two!

219
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,836
It went well for today.

220
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,717
- Until next time.
- And watch out...

221
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,394
- Next time will be the last time!
- If it's the last time...

222
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,436
...I'd hate to miss it.

223
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,112
Let me know where.

224
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,152
So this must be
the keeper of order.

225
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,231
But he rather calls out
for order than keeping it.

226
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,276
Don't provoke me!

227
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,318
And keep in mind:
I'm representing the law around here.

228
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,518
Well... and the criminals
elected you sheriff.

229
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,875
I don't think there's
someone else in this world...

230
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,678
...who started out
as low as you did...

231
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,990
...and succeeded
in going even lower.

232
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,275
Fine, you'll pay
for that, too.

233
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,271
And when it comes to you, Johnny,
my daughter's already told you...

234
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,078
...that she doesn't want you
around her anymore.

235
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,788
Go away from here,
before it's too late.

236
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,633
- My return seems to bother everybody.
- Well...

237
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,879
Listen...

238
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,751
This might interest you.

239
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,796
I kept it for you.

240
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,914
It lay next to
your father's corpse.

241
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,230
Someone said it's the
signature of his murderer.

242
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,799
Of Santana?

243
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,639
If it belongs to him -
it belongs to him.

244
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,674
Horaz...

245
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,472
I must know...

246
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,312
Must know why Santana
killed my father!

247
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,033
If Santana really did it.

248
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,633
Six times the bull's eye.

249
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,509
You're relying too much
on your skills.

250
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,551
Now your gun is... empty.

251
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,233
And you, Johnny...

252
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,155
...rely too much
on the appearance.

253
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,915
There could always be someone
who's been making precautions.

254
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,475
And it's...
the last shot that counts.

255
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,552
When you expect it
the least...

256
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,916
...you meet someone
who's quicker and smarter.

257
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,548
My father...
must have met someone like that.

258
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,312
Don't you think?

259
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,476
But I doubt that Santana
was quicker than my father.

260
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,439
Even more so:

261
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,995
I refuse to believe it.

262
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,475
And what are you trying
to say by that?

263
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,716
Someone like Santana doesn't
act without an intention.

264
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,192
What reason did he have
to kill my father?

265
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,876
Listen...
This is a very dirty story.

266
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,791
And I wouldn't want to be
the one to tell you.

267
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,711
I want to know.

268
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,748
The war had also
changed your father.

269
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,752
- Come on, keep talking.
- As you wish.

270
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,509
When the south
was about to lose...

271
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,592
...the townsfolk
here in Texas...

272
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,148
...collected a contribution
of 300,000 dollars.

273
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,119
Only your father knew the
transportation route. But instead...

274
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,878
...Santana attacked
the convoy.

275
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,232
Don't you think
that's strange?

276
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,998
Don't stop.

277
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,515
He killed the escort,
but he didn't find any gold.

278
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,068
And then he went
to your father.

279
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,030
Don't spit on his grave!

280
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,391
These are facts.

281
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,675
I don't want to know what kind
of relationship these two had.

282
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,911
But as I heard that Santana
killed your father -

283
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,560
...don't forget that
he was my brother -

284
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,112
...I avenged him!

285
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,397
Santana was a bandit.

286
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,630
And I butchered him
like a dog.

287
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,875
Everybody in this colony who has
a feeling for honor and justice...

288
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,632
...agreed with me.

289
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,310
And what happened
to the 300,000 dollars?

290
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,470
Everbody who knew
is dead.

291
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,073
Santana.

292
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,912
My father.

293
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,990
But this gold is missing.

294
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,120
Well... Whoever did that job,
did a good one.

295
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,792
After all, Horaz, the world's
a less awful place...

296
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,394
...if you look at it
through a glass.

297
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,633
And that's one more reason
for always keeping it full.

298
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,148
Cheers.

299
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,032
My father...

300
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,879
He always lived
a righteous life...

301
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,394
...to finish it with
a disgraceful death.

302
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,790
Nobody chooses...
his death.

303
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,633
The life...
that's what you have to choose.

304
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,154
And it's a difficult choice.

305
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,198
- Landing! We're there!
- Are we stopping here?

306
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,113
Finally!

307
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,792
We'll stay in a guesthouse
for a night!

308
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:32,112
Unload everything and make sure
that you don't beat a drum!

309
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,109
Et voila.

310
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,559
Who are you?

311
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,918
You're dead.

312
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,154
A no-good,
that's what you are!

313
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,117
Couldn't you have dug out
your witty jokes...

314
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,078
...on stage in Denver?

315
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,550
They wouldn't have kicked
us out of the theater then.

316
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,393
- I already sent you packing twice!
- I only do pantomime!

317
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,277
Just get lost with the amateur
who always blows his lines...

318
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,271
...on "to be or not to be"!
- And Ophelia?

319
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,954
She always goes with everybody.
Only in Denver...

320
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,508
...she had to play the
picky one with that judge!

321
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,113
The boos were directed
at her, not on me!

322
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,634
Also on you, windbag,
also on you!

323
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,075
I go to bed alone.

324
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,233
Hey soldier! Who had ever
imagined to meet you here?

325
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,869
Have you gone mad?
You've hurt me!

326
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,916
- Who gave that to you?
- Why? Are you jealous?

327
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,830
- I want to know where you got it from.
- Ah, I don't know. About a month ago.

328
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,992
From a Mexican with a dark voice.
A really handsome man.

329
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,278
- The name!
- I can't remember.

330
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,557
He had a big belt full
of those tiny things.

331
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,313
And then I
ripped some off.

332
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,755
- And if it doesn't go well?
- Come on, what are you afraid of?

333
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,070
Someone who's been buried for
two years doesn't walk around...

334
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,310
...and gives earrings
to actresses.

335
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,392
- Did you hear me, gravedigger?
- But I don't account for it.

336
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,109
If the girl told the truth,
then this grave is empty.

337
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,039
- Empty?
- Come on, dig!

338
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,590
For 100 dollars I'll dig
as far as hell!

339
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:23,309
5 to take them six feet under
and 100 to bring them back.

340
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,000
- We're there.
- Open up.

341
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,032
Stinks even worse than
the other killers' corpses.

342
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,712
Right, Mister?

343
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,150
It's a damn shame, letting
this here rot next to the worms.

344
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,151
That thing is
worth something!

345
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,033
Bury him again.

346
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,234
Johnny.

347
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,991
What are you doing here?

348
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,872
Are you ransacking
the graves?

349
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,870
Why are you watching me?

350
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,309
It appears to me that
you're beginning to overdo it.

351
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,034
You're acting like a jackal.

352
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,752
You're snooping around everywhere
just like a dirty, hungry dog...

353
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,956
...and you insult everyone
with your suspicions.

354
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,031
What the hell
are you looking for?

355
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,918
I wanted to look in the face
of my father's murderer.

356
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,592
In the face!

357
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,315
Do you understand?
In the face!

358
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,989
Johnny!

359
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,718
I did what I could
for your father.

360
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,474
And I couldn't save him.

361
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,190
But if you still
don't believe me...

362
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,874
Shoot!

363
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,317
Don't you think your
mother suffered enough?

364
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,919
Hey Guild.
Look, who's coming.

365
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,035
Jump, donkey! Jump!

366
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,510
Well, was it
of use for you?

367
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,876
Have you been in the cemetery?
What was in the coffin?

368
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,918
Santana.

369
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,312
Nevertheless, I don't believe that two
different Mexicans are running around here...

370
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,233
...collecting and giving
away the same little things.

371
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,876
So then, who's buried there?

372
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,553
Not the murderer of my father.
But he will end up there, too.

373
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,155
Whoever that is.

374
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,188
Hey...

375
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,234
Are you running around
with an empty gun?

376
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,911
I'm loading late...

377
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,510
...but I'm shooting first.

378
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,877
Hey, wake up!

379
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,153
Oh, look...

380
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,515
But these weren't the ones
that belonged to the actress.

381
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,116
They killed her, Horaz.

382
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,518
Obviously, the one who had her
disposed didn't want her to talk.

383
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,959
One witness less.
But he confirmed the suspicion.

384
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,118
And he also made
an even bigger mistake.

385
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,319
He didn't manage
to knock me off.

386
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,236
He tried -
and he'll do it again.

387
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,116
Nobody is perfect
in this world.

388
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,836
You wanted this one?

389
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,799
Yes, his!

390
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,113
Thanks.

391
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,919
Johnny, you must
remember...

392
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,237
...that it once belonged
to a good man.

393
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,594
I know.

394
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,399
Your father only used it
to defend himself.

395
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,712
And to protect us
and our land.

396
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,114
I hope that
you'll do the same.

397
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,279
Johnny, will you
come back?

398
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,119
Will you
promise me that?

399
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,119
Maybe.

400
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,668
I don't know.

401
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,274
Stop!

402
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,194
Pedro!

403
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,232
What are you
looking for, amigo?

404
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,234
- Santana.
- Santana?

405
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,469
Are you chasing
phantoms, hombre?

406
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,074
- Santana is dead.
- No! I don't believe so.

407
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,309
What is it that
you don't believe?

408
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,069
Freeze!

409
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,833
And now you'll accompany
me to the phantom.

410
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,635
There it is.

411
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,359
- Usually he's there, in this house.
- Ah, fine.

412
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,919
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

413
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,150
Santana!

414
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,630
Now I had enough
of these games, boy.

415
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,439
I just let you fool
around with my men...

416
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,636
...because it was
fun for me.

417
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,388
Hey hombre!

418
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,119
- Easy, man!
- Stay calm, Santana.

419
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,874
The young ones are
always impulsive.

420
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,596
You shouldn't lose your head
that easily, understand?

421
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,159
Understand what?

422
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,118
That you robbed
everything?

423
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,636
The life of my father,
the love of my mother, our land!

424
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,633
Sometimes, pain and anger
are very bad advisers.

425
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,155
I've already told you
that the war changed everything.

426
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,994
Johnny...

427
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,955
You have to accept these,
henceforth, final events.

428
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,235
The death
of your father...

429
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,791
...my marriage...

430
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,834
...and my adherence
to this land.

431
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,716
You're blaming me
for this, right?

432
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:49,114
Come on, Johnny, just listen to me.
Try to curb your antipathy.

433
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,519
Life goes on.

434
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,795
Why shouldn't the two
of us become friends?

435
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,233
Don't touch me!

436
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,349
It doesn't help you
to play this dirty comedy.

437
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,758
There's still one thing
I need to know about you.

438
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,513
And it's something that
doesn't interest only me...

439
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,469
- Where did you take the gold?
- What?

440
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,271
Did I mishear something
or did he say "gold"?

441
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,555
Yes!
The gold of the convoy.

442
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,235
What?

443
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,630
I think, I know where
this gold ended up.

444
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,234
Don't believe these
fooleries, Santana.

445
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,675
He's making up stories
to save his skin.

446
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,433
It doesn't make any difference
to kill him here or somewhere else.

447
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,713
You forced me to play
dead for two years.

448
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,836
You said the gold
was missing!

449
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,913
In fact, you know where it is!
I want the gold, the gold!

450
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,039
Let's go!

451
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,555
Of what use is this
fraud to you, Johnny?

452
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,232
If Santana realizes
that you've been lying...

453
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,356
...he's got one more
reason to kill you.

454
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,797
You lied as well.

455
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,552
But the last shot's
the one that counts.

456
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,752
Remember, your coffin
is buried in the cemetery, too!

457
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,638
Ah, you know,
gold wakes up the dead.

458
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,075
I'm revived again!

459
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,713
Let's go, Guild!

460
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:32,949
Stop!

461
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,312
Can you see
something, Ramon?

462
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,914
- Didn't you hear anything?
- Nothing.

463
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,830
Watch out! Everybody down!
On the ground!

464
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,868
Come here, Johnny!

465
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,039
Damn it!

466
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,915
Ross!

467
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,115
Stop shooting!
Go after them!

468
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,590
Hey Guild!
Come! We're off!

469
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,436
Your uncle is strong.

470
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,592
And maybe you revealed
your cards too early.

471
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,151
Now your life isn't worth
that much anymore.

472
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,313
And yours not more
than mine.

473
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,680
I'm sorry.
It's dangerous to be my friend.

474
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,478
I'm too curious.

475
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,230
If I don't count my enemies,
I don't have my peace.

476
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,919
I'm coming with you.

477
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,555
No.

478
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:54,112
That's my business.
And I have to sort it out by myself.

479
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,193
Okay.

480
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,876
We'll see each other
in one way or another.

481
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,713
If not here...

482
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,912
...then up there.
Or down there.

483
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,792
Goodbye, Horaz.

484
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,719
Come on, quick!

485
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,917
Come on, nobody saw you!
Johnny's waiting for you there.

486
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,872
Thanks! That's all.

487
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:51,915
Johnny!

488
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,199
Where are you?

489
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,319
Johnny!

490
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,999
It's me, Emily!

491
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,512
I warned you.

492
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,035
No!

493
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,830
No!
I'm begging you, no!

494
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,958
And you couldn't
keep your mouth shut.

495
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,439
Me, no!

496
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,636
No!
That's not true!

497
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,431
I didn't say anything.
I swear!

498
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,078
- I swear!
- Shut up!

499
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,436
- Believe me! Believe me!
- I believe you.

500
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:38,354
I'm even absolutely sure that you
won't say anything at all anymore.

501
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,395
No!

502
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:13,875
No.

503
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,749
No, I don't want to
part with my son.

504
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,396
- It must be done.
- I don't want to lose him.

505
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,998
You still regard
him as a boy.

506
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,516
Johnny is ungrateful,
a bullhead, up for everything.

507
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:31,115
- Without a touch of understanding.
- He's been away for too long.

508
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,997
Would have been better,
if he'd never gotten back.

509
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,877
He needs help.

510
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,430
Why should I stop
helping him?

511
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,999
You promised me,
with his return...

512
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,877
Because it's not easy.

513
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,872
I'm the man who took
his mother away from him.

514
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,750
And he won't
forgive me that.

515
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,188
Listen.

516
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:55,633
If somebody is in a
hopeless situation...

517
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,234
...he must go
his own way.

518
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:03,397
And the sooner he goes...
the better for everyone.

519
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,070
Gertie...
it's better for everybody.

520
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:16,434
If Johnny leaves me...

521
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,349
If I can't meet
him again...

522
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,997
Forgive me, Claude...

523
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:26,278
But I'll regret it
for my whole life.

524
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,275
What?
What do you want?

525
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,194
That's Johnny's!

526
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:53,071
- But this was the gun of his father.
- Yes, but I gave it to Johnny.

527
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:57,555
- What happened to him? Where is he?
- Where did you find it?

528
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:03,917
- It lay next to my daughter's corpse.
- No! Johnny...

529
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,799
Emily...

530
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,794
No.

531
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,713
Oh no...

532
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,953
No!
That can't be true!

533
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,119
It's absurd,
it's not true!

534
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,070
Oh no...
It's not true...

535
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,880
It is not true...
No...

536
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:44,869
Back again!

537
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,520
Are we going to dig
someone else out?

538
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:51,752
- Half the price, 50 dollars.
- No. This time for 5 dollars.

539
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,832
And you have to dig
the deepest grave of them all.

540
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,036
And on the gravstone
you'll engrave:

541
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,551
"Claude Hamilton.
Murderer of his brother."

542
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:07,474
I'm always on duty.
But for the digging, I need his measures.

543
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,393
Ah, too bad.
She was so young. Poor Emily.

544
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,910
And so beautiful.

545
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:33,912
I knew, he would
come back here.

546
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:37,279
- What are we going to do with him?
- Crucify him.

547
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:40,313
Vamos!
Ride at gallop!

548
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,638
Pull him up!

549
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:41,709
Pull!

550
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,715
Look!

551
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,673
That's Santana!

552
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,755
We better warn Mr. Claude.

553
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:29,995
Barricade the gate!

554
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,992
You there, quick!
Hurry up with the cart!

555
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,396
And you, help us!
Come on!

556
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:38,677
Leave it up there and
get the ammo! Come on!

557
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:45,479
Boss, Joe gave us a signal:
Santana will be here soon!

558
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:46,834
Ah, come here.

559
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:50,193
Listen. Tell the men,
they shouldn't show themselves.

560
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:51,554
Santana!

561
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:55,638
It must happen as fast as lightning.
Understood?

562
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,632
He thinks he'll surprise us.
But instead...

563
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,196
- Let everybody know!
- Alright.

564
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,635
Claude!

565
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,593
What's up, sweetheart?

566
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,869
- What's wrong?
- Santana.

567
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:21,918
You said you killed him to avenge
your brother - my husband.

568
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,711
You lied, he's alive!

569
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,637
Why did you lie?

570
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:30,393
- But Gertie...
- I want to know where Johnny is!

571
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,799
Tell me.

572
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,355
Tell me!

573
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,635
- Gertie, sweetheart...
- What happened to him? Talk!

574
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,073
- I'm begging you!
- Who shot my husband?

575
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:40,232
- I want the truth!
- Listen, put the gun away.

576
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,514
No.

577
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,558
What are you scared of?
Are you afraid of me?

578
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,593
Talk!
Who shot my husband?

579
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,477
- Very funny, stop it!
- Stop this masquerade, Claude!

580
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,198
- You don't scare me!
- What's wrong with you?

581
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,872
- Have you gone insane?
- I want the truth!

582
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,109
Gertie, you will regret...

583
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,349
...what you're doing right now...
- Too late!

584
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:57,318
- I'm already regretting since Johnny...
- Gertie!

585
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,470
Step back, Claude!
Or I'll kill you!

586
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:09,400
We arrived
just in time, boss.

587
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:29,233
Boss! Boss!
Santana is here!

588
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:32,712
To the windows, you two!
Move, knucklehead!

589
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,399
Move!

590
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,836
Attention, he's coming!

591
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,558
Let them come closer!

592
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:59,876
Come on, guys, let's go!
You brave men!

593
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:08,871
Folks, here are 300,000 dollars!
They're ours!

594
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:10,549
Go!

595
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:13,829
Come on!

596
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:16,835
Come on!

597
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,670
- Attention!
- Go!

598
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,638
Back into the house!

599
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,831
Cover the other side!

600
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:11,875
Gertie?

601
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,269
Gertie!

602
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:22,995
Stop!

603
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:40,472
Ramon! Go upstairs!

604
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:40,913
Oh no...

605
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,676
My son didn't do it.

606
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,273
What are you
planning to do here?

607
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,078
It wasn't him.
He loved Emily!

608
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,628
- He didn't kill her!
- He's a murderer!

609
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,112
And he must die.
Up there.

610
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,156
Like all murderers.

611
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:16,878
That's enough, sheriff!

612
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,554
- Leave this woman alone!
- And her son, too.

613
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,519
- What do you want from them?
- I thought, I told you...

614
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,033
...you should
go out of my way!

615
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,270
And I told you
to go to hell.

616
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,270
So leave,
because he's innocent.

617
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,074
What are you waiting for
to free him?

618
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:32,037
Would you like
to take his place?

619
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:34,157
It's reserved for you.

620
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:05,795
Johnny...

621
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,628
Johnny!

622
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:44,553
Claude!
Come on, get out, Claude!

623
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,034
Damn...

624
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,593
Ross, Guild!
Santana is dead.

625
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,516
Now we can
leave as well.

626
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,797
Get the horses
ready, quick.

627
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:54,680
This dirty bastard made it.
But on his own, impossible...

628
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,113
Look for him!

629
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,111
He won't have come far.

630
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,396
What are you doing?
Are you stopping?

631
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:34,390
And what about Claude?

632
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,994
What will he say if he
finds out that we stopped?

633
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:41,596
Where else do you want to look for him?
Someone must have given him a horse.

634
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:44,240
One more reason
to go on, right?

635
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:12,636
What does it help to ride on, anyway -
in the middle of the night?

636
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,631
Yes, yes.
You're right.

637
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:20,274
Ross, I'll have a drink.
Are you coming with me?

638
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:22,669
Let's assume he came here
and he's not alone...

639
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,432
We better
watch out, Guild.

640
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:26,750
But who should have helped him?
His friend?

641
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:28,910
That one's even more
worthless than him.

642
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,118
I'll take a short
look around.

643
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,278
Give me a whiskey.

644
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:50,119
Enjoy every sip.

645
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,952
Because it's the last one.

646
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,113
What are you waiting for?

647
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:05,595
Drink.

648
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:20,995
Ross!

649
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:22,709
Stop!

650
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,671
This fool...

651
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:28,799
Do you want to end up like Guild?
Come here!

652
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,031
Are you looking
for me, Ross?

653
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,072
Damn it...

654
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,154
Claude!

655
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:04,670
300,000 dollars, Claude!

656
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:07,640
Too much for that tiny bit
of life that you have left!

657
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:09,915
And too little for
so many dead people.

658
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:49,993
Damn!

659
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:59,110
And it's all gone with the wind...
Very good!

660
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,837
They're rummaging
the earth...

661
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,911
Rivaling the moles...

662
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,116
They rob themselves...
They hate themselves...

663
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:08,316
They shoot...
They maul themselves...

664
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:11,039
And now, it's all
gone with the wind.

665
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:23,036
Hello folks!
Nice day, isn't it?

666
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:25,395
Yes! Great!

667
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:28,678
- But the wind's not too shabby.
- Ah, you have to be contended.

668
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:31,638
But as long as there's work,
there's enough of everything.

669
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:37,638
It was a day like
this one, Horaz.

670
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:41,156
Do you remember?
You taught me how to ride.

671
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:44,596
And there was this voice coming out of
the house: "Don't lose heart, Johnny!"

672
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:46,875
- Your father.
- "At Gallop!"

673
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,794
"I want to see you run
like the wind."

674
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:51,029
Yes.

675
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,751
Like the wind...

676
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:57,392
Let's go, Johnny.

677
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:02,800
...15 and 16... Fine.

678
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:06,277
And we only have four coffins.
Right, good boy?

679
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,318
We'll have to go on
a lot of tours today!

680
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:12,358
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

681
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:16,314
Hey! Hey!

682
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:17,628
Hey folks!

683
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:21,952
If you clean up another place,
remember me!

684
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:25,715
The best gravdigger in Texas!
The best!

685
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,237
At gallop, Johnny!
Just like the wind!

686
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:33,198
THE END
