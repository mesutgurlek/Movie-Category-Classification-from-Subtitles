blocks of us. And you.

decisions for their kids.

Who the fuck do you think you are?

Someone who gives more
than half a shit about you.

Now are you coming or not?

You just cost me a shit ton of money!

what that man was doing up there?

Did you ask any questions?

00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,623
- Did you sign on a dotted line?
- No!

187
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:28,026
So what made you think there was
anything legit about that place?

188

it's forever. There are ramifications.

189

If you needed money,
you could have just asked me.

190

- Can I have some money?
- That's not the point.

191
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:41,281
- Why not?
- Because I don't have any! God, Jesus!

Jeez, what's his problem?
Is it that time of the month?

There aren't enough

Because I figure you could
use a vacation. I could too.

230

I could take you to

right out and say it.

so now we just gotta sit and wait.

470
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:45,575
- Who were you trying to call?
- Just a friend.

471
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:47,213
Yeah. Right.

472
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,047
- What's it to you?
- Nothing.

473
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:54,051
Just thought maybe you were
trying to call your boyfriend.

474
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:58,522
If you're into guys, that's fine
by me. Just a hunch is all.

475
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:00,157
You know, if you weren't right...

476
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:03,193
It wouldn't make any difference.
I didn't mean it as a slur.

477
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:06,964
Well, Miss Know-it-All,
you're right and you're wrong.

478
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,231
I was trying to call my ex.

479
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:10,667
Good for you.

480
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:13,306
So, are you into girls?
Is that how you can tell?

481
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,873
Now, why would you think that?
Is it cos I carry a gun?

482
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:20,043
- Cos I bust dudes' asses for a day job?
- Women commit crimes too.

483
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:23,313
Is it cos I look in a rear-view
mirror or a side-view mirror

484
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:24,681
more than a compact mirror?

485
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:27,751
Perish the thought. Don't make
it out like it's such a bad thing.

486
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:30,087

Sorry. That was out of line.

492
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,087
I had a thing with a girl once.

493
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:58,320
She was Latina.

494
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:01,061
Her name was Carmen.

495
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:06,227
Didn't feel anything, though.
No chemistry. That's how I knew.

496
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:13,230
And here I am, thinking the tough cookie
had a chocolate chip on her shoulder.

I'd know where and who I was.
