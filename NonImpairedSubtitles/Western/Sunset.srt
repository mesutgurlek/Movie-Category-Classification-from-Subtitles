1
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:42,017
Take her off!

2
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,861
Giddap!

3
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,662
Somebody help me!

4
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,874
Help me!

5
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,522
Tom!

6
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,941
Cut!

7
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,908
- I said cut.
- That was great.

8
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,781
Okay, that's lunch. Half an hour.

9
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,839
- Hi, Tom.
- Alfie.

10
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,262
- Hello, Tom.
- Miss Victoria.

11
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,885
- You look mighty pretty today.
- Thanks. So do you.

12
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,938
Let's go for a walk, Tom.

13
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,981
Randy, bring a couple chairs.

14
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,477
The film's looking very good.

15
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:01,030
Afraid we may have
another big hit on our hands.

16
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,444
- You came here to tell me that?
- No.

17
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:08,706
- How are you, Mr. Alperin?
- I didn't think so.

18
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,580
I just bought a sensational
script called Lawman.

19
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:22,294
About a famous frontier marshal,
Wyatt Earp.

20
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,754
Yeah, I heard of him.

21
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:29,936
"Alperin Films presents Tom Mix,
Hollywood's cowboy...

22
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:33,971
...starring as Wyatt Earp,
the West's famous lawman."

23
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:38,645
- I'll get Earp as technical advisor.
- Now hold on!

24
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,617
I didn't become numero uno at the
box office by playing other people.

25
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:54,204
Tom, this is a very
important project to me.

26
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:57,256
Fox and Chaplin are gambling on sound.

27
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:01,420
I'm betting my bankroll
on you in Lawman.

28
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,672
What if I don't agree?

29
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:14,185
Fact is, I'll be very unappy.

30
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:18,190
And you'll have to sit out
your contract.

31
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:23,271
Whers it up? March '33?
That's four years.

32
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:27,615
What are we saying?
You havert read the script yet.

33
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,995
I may be wrong,
but I'm sure you'll love it.

34
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:41,173
Well, I'll read it.
I'll let you know in the morning.

35
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,046
Fine.
I wanna start shooting next month.

36
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,381
I still have to talk
to the famous marshal.

37
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:50,349
All right, let's get back to work.

38
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:55,762
It should be educational,
working with a real gunfighter.

39
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:59,107
Maybe he'll give you some pointers.

40
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,645
Yeah, I bet he will.

41
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,618
You've got the wrong end
of the horse.

42
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,028
Depends on how you look at it.

43
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:17,996
If you was Tony Jr. Here, you'd think
you got the wrong end of Tom Mix.

44
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,383
Here comes Alfie.

45
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,425
- Bye, Alfie.
- Bye.

46
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:39,140
- Did he say yes?
- No, but he will.

47
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,770
Where's he going?

48
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:15,617
- It's been a pleasure, Mr. Earp.
- Feeling's mutual, George.

49
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:21,953
- Mr. Wyatt Earp?
- That's right. Tom Mix, isn't it?

50
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:24,076
That's right.

51
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,286
Can I give you a lift into town?

52
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:28,706
On your horse?

53
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:32,591
No, Tony Jr. Ain't got
no license plates.

54
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,511
I'm afraid you'll have to ride
in the Duesenberg.

55
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,431
There's a press conference at 2:00.

56
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:48,106
At 3:30, you meet with Mr. Alperin.
At 4, we have a photo session.

57
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,816
Will he have enough time to get
to the radio station by 5:30?

58
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:58,158
If we finish the photos by 4:45.
Do you have clothes that look Western?

59
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,115
We'll get something in wardrobe.

60
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:04,454
You look a like a Texas oil man
instead of a sheriff.

61
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,121
- A marshal.
- Marshal. What's the difference?

62
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,175
Hey, here they come!

63
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,595
Would you ever consider acting?

64
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:20,975
Excuse me.
I'm not gonna like staying here.

65
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:25,641
Then let's find you a place
where you will like staying.

66
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:31,276
Will Alperin be disappointed
if I don't show up for those things?

67
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,439
Yeah. That worry you?

68
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:36,735
I hired on as an advisor,
not a celebrity.

69
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,071
Well, that's it.

70
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:43,036
I lived here before I got famous.
Quiet. Private.

71
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:47,539
- Washed my socks in the sink.
- Think you can get me in?

72
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:51,794
Sure, I own it.
Mi casa es su casa.

73
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:55,793
- You learn Spanish in Cuba?
- You knew I was in Cuba?

74
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:59,091
I read about it in the Sunday paper.

75
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:02,759
- Lf it's in print, it's gotta be true.
- Absolutely.

76
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,765
In the Chicago Tribune
they said you were in the Boer War.

77
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:12,983
- Any photos?
- No, just sketches and engravings.

78
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:16,862
Engravings? Isn't that how
counterfeiters make funny money?

79
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,199
Cue the Earps.

80
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:53,147
- Dialogue!
- You're under arrest.

81
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:05,780
Don't kill me!
I ain't shooting!

82
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,748
The fight's commenced.
Get to fighting or get out.

83
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:33,563
Dialogue, Billy.

84
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:39,116
God, forgive me for all
the bad things I've done.

85
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:42,993
Cut!

86
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:48,405
- We'll do the close- ups after lunch.
- All right, that's lunch.

87
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,701
- Was it okay?
- Okay for me.

88
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:55,580
- Was that really just like it?
- Just like it.

89
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,004
I want to get Tom's close- ups first.

90
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,843
Tom, that was interesting.

91
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:09,009
- Suggestions?
- No. You handle a six-gun pretty good.

92
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:12,557
- Praise from Caesar.
- Can you hit anything?

93
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:17,187
You gotta hit what you shoot at.
I just gotta look good.

94
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,485
Was that really the way it was?

95
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:24,240
- Absolutely. Give or take a lie or two.
- Mr. Earp.

96
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,783
Good morning, Miss Shoemaker.

97
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,245
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.

98
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,285
Honey, I'm gonna propose.

99
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:34,539
If you don't do publicity,
I'll lose my job.

100
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:40,546
I don't want that to happen.
I'll work it out with Mr. Alperin.

101
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:45,548
I know Alfie. He won't talk
until he gets his pound of flesh.

102
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,886
Do you mind if I try anyway?

103
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:54,351
- Okay, Mr. Earp.
- Would you mind making that Wyatt?

104
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,059
Sure, if you make it Nancy.

105
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:00,440
You warm an old mars heart, Nancy.

106
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:05,940
Shame on you, Wyatt, trying to pull
that old man stuff on me.

107
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:11,249
Mr. Earp?
Chief Dibner wants to see you.

108
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,335
- Who?
- Chief of security. I'll take you.

109
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:17,457
No need.
Just point me in the direction.

110
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,214
Go down Main Street.
Last bungalow on the left.

111
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,754
- Sounds easy. Thanks, officer.
- You're welcome.

112
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,211
Hey, Wyatt.

113
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,510
- Where you headed?
- Chief Dibner wants me.

114
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,300
Hold on a minute.

115
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,310
- Make him come to you.
- Why?

116
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:41,397
Because he's a dangerous
son of a bitch.

117
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:45,569
You know what they say about
bearding a lion in his den.

118
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:50,612
Sometimes the same thing applies
to dangerous sons of bitches.

119
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:53,957
You could've made a hell of an actor.

120
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:57,168
Marshalling and acting
arert too far apart.

121
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:02,711
One time, I wasrt packing my six-gun,
and Doc Holliday was drunk.

122
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:06,551
He was roaring he was gonna
shoot my earlobes off.

123
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,928
I went for a hideout gun.

124
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:11,638
Luckily, he thought I had one.

125
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:15,179
- Is that the truth?
- Oh, every word.

126
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:17,853
Give or take a lie or two.

127
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,101
Watch yourself, amigo.

128
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:55,259
It's just a Western.
Some Indians die, big deal.

129
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:58,012
- Watch your step.
- Michael, please!

130
00:14:58,273 --> 00:14:59,388
Hold on.

131
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:03,771
Excuse me, but you're in the way
of some very dedicated drinking.

132
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:05,689
Well, I'm sorry.

133
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:08,355
Hey! What picture are you in?

134
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,153
I'm not.

135
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:14,448
- Well, then who are you?
- Name's Earp.

136
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:15,993
Wyatt Earp?

137
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:20,499
Well, I'm Billy the Kid,
and she's Calamity Jane.

138
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:26,497
Mary Jane Canary was a dear woman,
but she looked like an unmade bed.

139
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,552
- This young lady's much too pretty.
- Thank you, Mr. Earp.

140
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:35,515
Mr. Earp is here.

141
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:42,557
I'm Marvin Dibner.

142
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:45,310
Well, have a seat.

143
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:59,915
Apparently, Mrs. Alperin knows
you're here in Hollywood.

144
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:06,497
Mrs. Alperin would like you
to pay a call on her as a favour.

145
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,090
You know who she is?

146
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,754
Did you ever meet her?

147
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:20,020
- You don't say much, do you, Wyatt?
- No, I don't.

148
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:23,771
Also, it's Mr. Earp.
Or Marshal, or even Earp.

149
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:27,940
Not Wyatt until I tell you.
And while I think of it...

150
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:30,770
...don't ever question me again.

151
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:33,524
Just trying to be friendly.

152
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:36,579
You're trying to stay
ahead of the game.

153
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:40,917
Your boss's wife wants to talk to me,
you want to know why.

154
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:43,747
Probably your boss does too.

155
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:54,462
My job is to get curious about
anything involving Mrs. Alperin.

156
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:58,346
- You know what she wants?
- Why not ask Mrs. Alperin?

157
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,469
What's bothering you?

158
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:04,352
Your bad manners and the fact
you don't hear too good.

159
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:08,558
I told you not to try questioning me.

160
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,187
And I meant it.

161
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:39,056
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Mr. Earp.

162
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:42,310
- Can I help you?
- With what?

163
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,774
First off, don't ever crowd anybody
unless you got a first-class reason.

164
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:56,570
Did you do a lot of time, boy?

165
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,201
- Where?
- Folsom.

166
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:02,247
For what?

167
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:05,747
Armed robbery.

168
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:09,455
Make a move, it'll be
the mistake of your life.

169
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:12,669
- Am I clear?
- Oh, yeah.

170
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:22,095
- Yes, sir?
- Marshal Earp to see Mrs. Alperin.

171
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:24,929
If you'll follow me.

172
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:33,852
I'll inform Mrs. Alperin
that you're here.

173
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,366
Not much like Denver.

174
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:52,796
Mr. Earp, thank you for coming.

175
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,472
- I've hoped to see you again.
- I wanted to hear from you.

176
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:04,432
It wouldn't have been fitting.
I didn't think you'd remember.

177
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:06,768
You've never been forgotten.

178
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:10,771
You are just as I remember.
Perhaps taller.

179
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:14,852
- Is it possible that you grew?
- Not likely.

180
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:18,399
Then there can only be
one explanation.

181
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:20,693
I was wearing high heels.

182
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:25,282
You were. Soft, gray kid
high-button shoes.

183
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:29,124
- How could you remember?
- I undid them.

184
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,170
- The buttons were yellow ivory.
- Whalebone.

185
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,924
That night in Denver,
you said...

186
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:44,930
That if you were ever in trouble,
I'd come.

187
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:50,770
Let's go outside where we won't
be interrupted.

188
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:10,533
Alfie told me you were here,
and everyone else is afraid.

189
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:14,626
- Afraid?
- Of each other. Of...

190
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:16,506
Of your husband?

191
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,592
Yes, I suppose so.

192
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:22,842
They're afraid Alfie might not
want me helped.

193
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:24,842
With your son?

194
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:28,049
I met him today at the studio.

195
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:31,266
- Was he...?
- Drinking? Yes.

196
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:44,326
I received a letter from a woman
I used to know named Candace Girard.

197
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:49,204
She runs a place
called the Candy Store.

198
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:55,163
She says Michael hurt one of her girls
and I suggests I buy her off.

199
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,758
- What was the girl's name?
- Rhonda Lopez. Please see her.

200
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,011
I've no one to turn to.
I'll pay anything.

201
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:08,850
I'm not for hire. I'll do it
for the way you held the roses.

202
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:20,109
Christina Alperirs a very lovely lady
who married the wrong man.

203
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:23,318
Easy to understand.
When she met Alfie...

204
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:26,155
...he didn't want
to take over the world.

205
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:32,746
He was still "The Happy Hobo"
that people laughed at and loved.

206
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:38,835
I'm here to tell you, Wyatt,
when he wanted to be...

207
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:44,420
...he could be the most charming,
considerate...

208
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,349
...giving, funny man.

209
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:51,262
Especially when he wanted something.

210
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:54,688
He sure did want Christina.

211
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:59,816
Arert you hot?

212
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:02,567
It's open.

213
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:08,827
- The press awaits.
- Better get her done, pardner.

214
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:17,957
I explained that you have pressing
engagements and must be done by 6:30.

215
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:20,669
- How did you know that?
- I didn't.

216
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:23,374
Tom's taking me on a tour.

217
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:29,004
Starting with Graumars Chinese
and ending up at the Candy Store.

218
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,993
- Good evening, Mr. Mix.
- Cheryl.

219
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:56,540
Allow me to introduce Mr. Wyatt Earp.

220
00:22:56,793 --> 00:23:00,293
- The real Wyatt Earp?
- Yes, I'm not dead yet.

221
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:01,745
I can see that.

222
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:06,420
Promise not to close us down
like the saloons in Tombstone.

223
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:11,139
- I never closed a saloon in my life.
- Good.

224
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,392
- We know what Tom drinks.
- I'll have...

225
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:21,182
No, let me guess.
A Waterfill and Frazier...

226
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:25,108
...and a cold Dos Equis to chase.

227
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:26,401
Close enough.

228
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:32,114
- How long do you plan to be in town?
- As long as I find it interesting.

229
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:37,246
- We'll do what we can to keep you.
- I think that'd be nice.

230
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,867
- Cheryl.
- Miss Alperin.

231
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:44,128
Victoria Alperin,
Alfie's kid sister, and...

232
00:23:44,383 --> 00:23:46,459
Dutch Kieffer.

233
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:50,966
I'm surprised a marshal
knows the Chicago underworld.

234
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:54,508
East or West, a crook is a crook.

235
00:23:55,602 --> 00:24:00,395
Did Tom tell you that our ladies
all look like famous movie stars?

236
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:03,693
Greta? This is Mr. Wyatt Earp.

237
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:08,570
- It's a pleasure, Mr. Earp.
- My pleasure, Ms. Garbo.

238
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,538
Amazing resemblance.

239
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:20,375
Yes, and besides Greta,
we have Janet Gaynor, Pola Negri...

240
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:22,709
...and the Gish sisters.

241
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:25,419
I forget you're here on business.

242
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:30,217
Mrs. Alperin wanted me to talk
to Candace Girard.

243
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,880
I see. About the girl
that Michael beat up?

244
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:36,802
Yes.

245
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:39,973
You'll find Candace
in the guest cottage.

246
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:44,056
That's where she lives
and sometimes entertains.

247
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:47,852
Use the back door.
Tom knows the way.

248
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:55,784
Will you be here when I get back?

249
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,654
Depends on when you get back.

250
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:02,158
How you doing, pal?

251
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:05,791
Hiya, big boy.

252
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:18,386
Honeysuckle.

253
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:24,394
- You arert what I expected you to be.
- What exactly did you expect?

254
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:28,149
I don't know, exactly.
A little less civilized.

255
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:32,525
You're not exactly what
I expected you to be, either.

256
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:35,700
What exactly did you expect I'd be?

257
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:38,076
Taller, maybe.

258
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:42,829
Candy! It's Tom Mix, honey.

259
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,039
Candy!

260
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:00,181
- Cadillac Eight.
- Recognize it?

261
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:02,179
No.

262
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:05,596
I got a lousy feeling about this.

263
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:09,108
Yeah, I got the same lousy feeling.

264
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:13,447
Candy!

265
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:16,367
Candy?

266
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,329
Oh, shit.

267
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:48,475
- Michael Alperin.
- Yeah, we met. Get the car.

268
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,903
Candy! Open up, it's important.

269
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:58,276
- It's a raid.
- Where's the car?

270
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,943
- Killed her!
- What's going on?

271
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:03,654
- What happened?
- Don't go in there!

272
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:07,914
- No! No!
- Cheryl, come on! Cheryl!

273
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:14,422
Tom! Get your hat and close this door!

274
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:17,173
- Cheryl! Shut up!
- No!

275
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,552
Cheryl! Listen to me!

276
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:22,758
Listen to me! Listen!

277
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:28,396
Get down! Get down!

278
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:35,651
Pull yourself together.
Go in there and keep your mouth shut.

279
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:41,861
Come on, Tom!

280
00:27:47,543 --> 00:27:50,294
- I didn't know you could drive.
- I can't.

281
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:54,923
Hey, look out!

282
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:13,809
Close that door, honey.

283
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:19,778
- Get him undressed.
- Will you tell...?

284
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:21,901
Candy Girard was murdered.

285
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,110
They're looking for Michael.
We gotta keep him here.

286
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:28,247
- He did it?
- I don't think so.

287
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,208
- I killed her.
- He disagrees.

288
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,575
He's drugged.

289
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:36,048
- You mean drunk.
- That too. He's gonna be sick again.

290
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:37,717
Towels!

291
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:40,049
- You sure about her?
- Real sure.

292
00:28:40,304 --> 00:28:43,720
- That's sure enough for me.
- Honey, come on.

293
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:45,558
Wait, wait.

294
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:53,895
- We gotta go. Can you handle this?
- Sure, I'll just pretend he's my ex.

295
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:58,860
- It's gonna be a couple of days.
- I'll manage. I'll call in sick.

296
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:01,819
I'll call you as soon as I get home.

297
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,317
Tom, come on.

298
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:11,533
- What if he decides to leave?
- Where is he going without his pants?

299
00:29:16,882 --> 00:29:18,791
I killed her.

300
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:22,173
God, I hope you're lying.

301
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:55,872
Wyatt.

302
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:22,271
I'm okay.

303
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:25,280
I'm all right.

304
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:32,780
Will you sleep with me?

305
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:36,710
I'm old enough to be your father.

306
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:42,918
You're old enough to be my grandfather.
Now answer the question.

307
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:45,758
Yes.

308
00:30:48,182 --> 00:30:51,432
I just need to be held.

309
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:59,983
At one time or another, we all do.

310
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:12,533
- Why did you tell Cheryl where I was?
- She asked me.

311
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:15,459
I figured if she asked,
you'd tell her.

312
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:17,037
- Was I wrong?
- Nope.

313
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:18,711
Grand girl.

314
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:23,915
A grand 26-year-old girl.
Could've done myself permanent injury.

315
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:28,840
- How many men you killed?
- How many cars you got?

316
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:32,300
- About 16.
- You got more cars.

317
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:34,601
Mr. Mix!

318
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:42,810
Captain Dibner wants you and Mr. Earp
to report to his office.

319
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:49,899
Mr. Mix and Mr. Earp.

320
00:31:56,875 --> 00:32:01,169
Wyatt Earp, Captain Blackwon'th, P.D.
Tom, you know him.

321
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:04,630
Have a seat.

322
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:14,514
You boys were at the Candy Store
last night.

323
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:18,472
- Was we?
- Guess we was.

324
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:23,189
Candace Girard was killed
shortly before you left.

325
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:26,773
- Did you know that, Wyatt?
- Yeah.

326
00:32:27,698 --> 00:32:31,114
- Dib, you got a drink?
- Yes, sir.

327
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:38,491
I'm a tequila man.

328
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:40,952
Waterfill and Frazier.

329
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:48,380
You saw a girl. Cheryl.

330
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:52,629
Gotta hand it to you.
You sure are up on things.

331
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:56,764
We need to talk to her.
She was...

332
00:32:57,186 --> 00:32:59,427
...close with Candy.

333
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:02,598
Real close.

334
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:10,740
Maybe you'd talk at headquarters.

335
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:15,452
So far, you've been telling us things.
Ask questions, you'll get answers.

336
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:18,539
What do you know about Candy's murder?

337
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:20,492
Very little.

338
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:22,909
Practically nothing.

339
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,708
No idea who killed her?

340
00:33:26,507 --> 00:33:30,919
- Could be the man in the black Cadillac.
- What black Cadillac?

341
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:34,470
The one that drove out of the alley.

342
00:33:34,723 --> 00:33:38,388
- Licence number.
- I forget.

343
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:42,637
Yeah, I forget too.

344
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:47,603
Well, if I was you,
I'd damn well try to remember.

345
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:52,031
You'd have trouble remembering
when you get pushed hard.

346
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:57,028
Let me give you an example.
Why did you raid the Candy Store?

347
00:33:57,287 --> 00:34:00,822
It was engaged in the practice
of prostitution.

348
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:03,497
That's illegal here.

349
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:05,033
Come on, captain.

350
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:08,872
Candy's been around a long time.
It's a gold mine.

351
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:13,462
To stay open, she had to be
paying someone a lot of juice.

352
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,765
I don't know. That's not
my department, that's vice.

353
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:22,637
Well, there you go.
That's the way it is in the big city.

354
00:34:22,855 --> 00:34:28,062
Everybody's in another department.
All nice and legal.

355
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:32,945
Tell me, captain. With all those
different departments...

356
00:34:33,198 --> 00:34:37,694
...have you got a department that
looks into crooked cops on the take?

357
00:34:43,709 --> 00:34:45,452
See?

358
00:34:45,794 --> 00:34:48,914
Sometimes you get pushed too hard...

359
00:34:49,173 --> 00:34:51,628
...you got a tendency to forget.

360
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:54,000
Afternoon, Dib.

361
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:59,806
You're not gonna let him
get away with that?

362
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:01,221
No.

363
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,053
What are you gonna do?

364
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:06,727
I don't know...

365
00:35:06,982 --> 00:35:09,769
...but I'm gonna love it.

366
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:12,562
Get out of town, Earp.

367
00:35:15,032 --> 00:35:18,401
- Smile when you say that, pardner.
- Oh, yeah?

368
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:39,718
Cut! That was great.

369
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:42,642
How'd you like it?

370
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:44,684
It was real thrilling...

371
00:35:44,937 --> 00:35:48,187
...but I've never been
in a fight like that.

372
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,105
- And Buffalo Bill didn't kill Injuns.
- You're right.

373
00:35:52,361 --> 00:35:55,445
Bill was good, but not as good
as his publicity.

374
00:35:55,656 --> 00:35:58,360
Like a movie star cowboy I know.

375
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:04,245
I get the feeling you're not
comfortable being a famous movie star.

376
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:10,252
What if I told you when Roosevelt
was charging up San Juan Hill...

377
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:13,077
...I was in Muskogee busting broncs.

378
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,507
I'd say that you and I
are whole lot alike.

379
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,674
Part fact and just enough fiction
to sell newspapers.

380
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:23,636
Nobody's comfortable being anything.

381
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:29,977
I think the trick is to know the fact,
and don't believe the fiction.

382
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:36,519
Tell me about Blackwon'th.

383
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,825
Known as "Dirty Bernie."
Not a nice piece of work.

384
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:45,489
- I think he'd like to kill one of us.
- Which one?

385
00:36:45,747 --> 00:36:46,945
Maybe both.

386
00:36:47,165 --> 00:36:51,294
If it's me, I'm counting on you
to avenge me.

387
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:57,586
- Waterfill and Frazier?
- Oh, no. Too early.

388
00:36:57,843 --> 00:37:01,046
Says you. This morning,
I need some help.

389
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:05,172
Do you know Rhonda Lopez?

390
00:37:05,434 --> 00:37:09,384
- The girl Michael beat up?
- Alleged to have beat up.

391
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:13,015
Met her once or twice.
Can't say I know her.

392
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:14,692
- Tom!
- Where's Michael?

393
00:37:14,943 --> 00:37:17,613
Gone. I tried to stop him
but he left.

394
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:21,908
- In his underwear?
- No, in your pajamas.

395
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:24,076
- What's that?
- Tequila.

396
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:27,827
You know I don't drink tequila.
He called a cab.

397
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,913
I tried to reach you.

398
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:33,079
- What cab company?
- Checkered, I think.

399
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:36,291
- Know where he went?
- No. Can you find out?

400
00:37:36,548 --> 00:37:38,707
Maybe. We gotta be careful.

401
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:42,502
We don't want the cab company
calling the police.

402
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:52,142
What the hell did you run into?

403
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:55,310
Mr. Alperin wants Mr. Earp
to have lunch.

404
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:09,112
I'm sorry we couldn't meet sooner.
I've had meetings all week.

405
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:12,789
Twelve, sometimes 15 hours a day.

406
00:38:13,418 --> 00:38:16,206
Couldrt even have lunch till now.

407
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:18,248
You must enjoy your work.

408
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:21,502
Most of the time
it's a real challenge.

409
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:25,134
Keeps me on my toes. Keeps me young.

410
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:30,723
- Have you seen any of my pictures?
- A few.

411
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:38,108
My biggest problem
is staying in shape.

412
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:43,906
Not like it was when I was an acrobat.

413
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:47,651
These days I have to steal time
just to work out.

414
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:51,826
I've found that a strong,
agile, average man...

415
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:56,287
...can nearly always beat a strong,
clumsy, big man.

416
00:38:56,503 --> 00:38:59,338
Now, you take, for example, Arthur.

417
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:05,420
Remember Arthur, who was unsuccessful
in preventing you from seeing my wife.

418
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:08,633
Please, don't misunderstand me.

419
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:11,808
I'm not opposed to you seeing my wife.

420
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:17,559
I'm opposed to people not doing their
jobs. It was Arthur's job to stop you.

421
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:20,016
Even if he knew I was expected?

422
00:39:20,235 --> 00:39:22,987
But he didn't. That's the point.

423
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:26,815
So the strong, agile, average man...

424
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:29,607
...showed the strong, big, clumsy man.

425
00:39:29,828 --> 00:39:32,615
The error of his ways. Exactly.

426
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:35,868
- He must love his job.
- He has no choice.

427
00:39:36,126 --> 00:39:38,961
He's on parole to me.

428
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:47,966
There is nothing more important than
the welfare and safety of my family.

429
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:52,136
Which brings us to the reason
that you saw my wife.

430
00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:56,479
- She asked you to help Michael.
- Did she tell you that?

431
00:39:56,688 --> 00:40:00,982
I've been told the police suspect
that he murdered Candace.

432
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:05,232
If you really want to help,
get him to turn himself in.

433
00:40:05,489 --> 00:40:06,734
I'll try.

434
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,366
Good.

435
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:10,190
Where is he?

436
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:12,119
Why would I know?

437
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:16,320
You were at the Candy Store.
I presumed you helped him.

438
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:18,748
To hide, to get away?

439
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:23,415
If he did kill Candace Girard,
that would make me an accessory.

440
00:40:23,632 --> 00:40:26,467
I did see another
member of your family.

441
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:31,173
Your sister Victoria
on the arm of Dutch Kieffer.

442
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,141
What is it that you want?

443
00:40:35,561 --> 00:40:38,894
To do whatever I can
to help Christina.

444
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:40,137
Why?

445
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:43,192
Because she asked.

446
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:54,692
That's okay, we've gotta go anyway.

447
00:40:54,955 --> 00:40:56,118
How are you?

448
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:59,451
- Call me.
- And me too.

449
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:03,670
I got a favour to ask you.

450
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:07,332
I want you to tell Dirty Bernie
to lay off Wyatt.

451
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:08,831
He won't listen.

452
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:12,884
You don't want Earp to blow down
Alfie's house of cards.

453
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:14,972
Expose him for what he is.

454
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:18,303
- Just how would he do that?
- Wanna find out?

455
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,896
Turn down my favour.

456
00:41:20,189 --> 00:41:23,640
Pick your ass up out of the chair.
You'll find out.

457
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:25,359
Go ahead, Marvin.

458
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:27,899
Take that chance.

459
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:30,948
- I'll see what I can do.
- Not good enough.

460
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,488
Either do it or don't.

461
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:35,119
Get it?

462
00:41:38,749 --> 00:41:41,370
Have a nice day, Dib.

463
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:52,469
How was your lunch?

464
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:54,423
The man is crazy.

465
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:00,180
Underneath all that happy lovability
and charm is a brutal sadist.

466
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:03,640
- How come nobody spotted it?
- It's been spotted.

467
00:42:03,857 --> 00:42:05,897
Nobody's proven it...

468
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:09,977
...although it's a topic of
conversation in the industry.

469
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:12,149
I've got some bad news.

470
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:15,278
Michael has been
arrested and booked...

471
00:42:15,536 --> 00:42:17,943
...for the murder of Candace Girard.

472
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:21,947
They'll locate the cab driver
who picked him up.

473
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:27,665
- Lf they tie you in, you're in danger.
- We gotta get you out of town.

474
00:42:27,923 --> 00:42:30,628
- Go to the ranch.
- And don't go home.

475
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:33,292
Let me borrow your car.

476
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,012
What's the next move?

477
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:42,096
- What?
- He don't know how to drive.

478
00:42:54,283 --> 00:42:56,240
This time I gotta stop you.

479
00:42:56,451 --> 00:43:00,449
Tell him to go to hell.
I'll talk to the parole board.

480
00:43:00,706 --> 00:43:03,113
- They'll listen to him.
- He's worse.

481
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,955
- Nothing's worse.
- I gotta see her.

482
00:43:06,211 --> 00:43:08,287
Mr. Earp, please come in.

483
00:43:08,505 --> 00:43:11,043
I'll explain to Mr. Alperin.

484
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,585
Tell your boss I pulled a gun on you.

485
00:43:19,683 --> 00:43:22,637
Tom called.
He said you were on your way.

486
00:43:22,895 --> 00:43:25,468
- Tell me about Michael.
- You all right?

487
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:28,609
- Did he do it, Wyatt?
- I don't think so.

488
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:32,942
- Will you help him?
- I'll try.

489
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,488
There's something else.

490
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:38,368
It's not just Michael.

491
00:43:38,577 --> 00:43:40,866
- What is it, Christina?
- Please!

492
00:43:55,636 --> 00:44:00,843
If I knew you were coming to see
Christina I'd have given you a ride.

493
00:44:01,058 --> 00:44:02,849
I asked him to come by.

494
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:06,429
Saved you the trouble of
pulling that gun on Arthur.

495
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:09,850
Darling, shouldn't you be in bed?

496
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:14,064
I'm much better.

497
00:44:14,279 --> 00:44:16,319
Christina took a nasty fall.

498
00:44:16,532 --> 00:44:19,153
Luckily no bones broken, huh?

499
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:24,237
The doctor recommended that she
stay in bed for the next few days.

500
00:44:25,332 --> 00:44:27,657
I know how worried you are.

501
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:31,660
You've simply got to take more
care of yourself.

502
00:44:31,922 --> 00:44:33,001
Now, go on.

503
00:44:33,257 --> 00:44:34,917
Back to bed.

504
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:37,459
I'm sure Mr. Earp will understand.

505
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:41,426
Thank you, Mr. Earp.

506
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:44,472
I'll be up shortly.

507
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:53,439
You know, Mr. Earp...

508
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:56,310
I considered you a good investment...

509
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:00,230
...but lately you've become
more trouble than you're won'th.

510
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:03,026
If anything happens to Christina...

511
00:45:03,245 --> 00:45:07,658
...you're gonna have to come up with
a new definition of trouble.

512
00:45:09,126 --> 00:45:11,795
What am I gonna do for clothes?

513
00:45:12,045 --> 00:45:14,619
We'll get you the clothes you need.

514
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,413
Asunciòn will get you what you need.

515
00:45:17,634 --> 00:45:19,342
- Asunciòn?
- The housekeeper.

516
00:45:19,595 --> 00:45:22,264
- Don't leave, you understand?
- I do.

517
00:45:22,514 --> 00:45:24,306
- This is serious.
- Okay.

518
00:45:24,558 --> 00:45:27,096
Get in.

519
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:28,769
- Filled with gas?
- Yes.

520
00:45:28,979 --> 00:45:31,980
Check to make sure
nobody's following you.

521
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:35,809
This baby could outrun
anything on four wheels.

522
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:39,977
It's hard being in competition
with a horse and 16 cars.

523
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,814
I'd rather be with you than any car.

524
00:45:43,035 --> 00:45:45,277
What about your horse?

525
00:45:45,537 --> 00:45:48,906
- Don't answer that.
- Get her going, George.

526
00:45:51,919 --> 00:45:55,288
- What are you gonna do without me?
- Whatever I can.

527
00:45:55,506 --> 00:45:57,249
Bye.

528
00:46:01,678 --> 00:46:03,920
Candy's my mother.

529
00:46:07,434 --> 00:46:11,847
She thought I looked cute
and provocative in mers clothing.

530
00:46:13,732 --> 00:46:17,267
She knew people would
assume we were lovers.

531
00:46:19,655 --> 00:46:20,935
And...

532
00:46:23,158 --> 00:46:26,242
And I wouldn't have to entertain.

533
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:35,832
I expect that's why Dirty Bernie's
looking for me.

534
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,627
It's Candy's customers.

535
00:46:41,552 --> 00:46:46,048
Various notations on their
lifestyles and preferences.

536
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:50,429
Who is "Hellman, Robert"?

537
00:46:50,936 --> 00:46:52,514
The mayor.

538
00:46:54,565 --> 00:47:00,021
Enough in here to get a lot of
important people in a lot of trouble.

539
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:03,524
You knew about most of these things?

540
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,235
Yes.

541
00:47:09,496 --> 00:47:13,624
According to this,
Michael's a lot like his father.

542
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:15,032
No, not really.

543
00:47:15,294 --> 00:47:19,422
Michael's basically passive
unless he drinks.

544
00:47:20,299 --> 00:47:24,842
But, Alfie...
He enjoys hurting people.

545
00:47:53,749 --> 00:47:56,156
There are some interesting things...

546
00:47:56,376 --> 00:48:01,334
...about Dutch Kieffer and Victoria.

547
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:03,626
Yeah.

548
00:48:04,343 --> 00:48:08,210
She likes women, and he likes to watch.

549
00:48:25,822 --> 00:48:29,488
You're a long way
from Tombstone, marshal.

550
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:39,499
Where can I find Dutch Kieffer?

551
00:48:40,754 --> 00:48:43,672
We//, you cou/d try the Kit Kat C/ub.

552
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:55,140
- There you go.
- Thank you very much, sir.

553
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:20,428
Hi, Tom.

554
00:50:20,687 --> 00:50:23,143
May I take your hat?

555
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:37,531
Who the hell let you in?

556
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:40,455
Ladies.

557
00:50:42,626 --> 00:50:45,295
- The door was open.
- There's a doorbell.

558
00:50:45,504 --> 00:50:47,128
I rang it.

559
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:50,542
- Nobody answered.
- You could've knocked.

560
00:50:51,593 --> 00:50:54,215
How well did you know Candy Girard?

561
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:57,181
What the hell business
is it of yours?

562
00:50:57,391 --> 00:51:01,519
You may not like this, Victoria...

563
00:51:01,728 --> 00:51:04,433
...but I'm making it my business.

564
00:51:05,941 --> 00:51:10,437
My houseman was the Australian
light heavyweight boxing champion.

565
00:51:10,612 --> 00:51:13,530
He'll kick your ass
all the way to Pasadena.

566
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:17,572
- Well, in the meantime...
- There is no "in the meantime."

567
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:22,198
You were there the night
she was murdered.

568
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:24,703
So were you.

569
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,787
So were a lot of people.

570
00:51:27,045 --> 00:51:28,421
So what?

571
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:31,335
You think your nephew killed her?

572
00:51:33,135 --> 00:51:34,843
How the hell do I know?

573
00:51:35,053 --> 00:51:40,130
In case you hadrt noticed,
Michael's a serious lush.

574
00:51:40,392 --> 00:51:43,975
When he's drunk,
he's been known to beat up women.

575
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:50,102
Maybe that's what happened with Candy.
Maybe he lost control and killed her.

576
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,771
Maybe.

577
00:51:52,487 --> 00:51:56,355
As anybody could see,
you're all broken up about it.

578
00:51:56,575 --> 00:51:58,235
Son of a bitch!

579
00:51:58,493 --> 00:52:01,779
Somebody with a real bad temper
killed Candy.

580
00:52:05,334 --> 00:52:08,418
Hurt him. Really hurt him.

581
00:52:08,629 --> 00:52:10,420
I recognize you.

582
00:52:10,631 --> 00:52:13,038
You're Tom Mix, the movie star.

583
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,503
I hear you've
sparred with Jack Dempsey.

584
00:52:16,762 --> 00:52:18,090
Come on, mate.

585
00:52:18,347 --> 00:52:20,672
Let's see what you've learned.

586
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:26,145
- Marquis of Queensberry?
- Yeah, okay. Marquis of Queensberry.

587
00:52:27,105 --> 00:52:28,304
I gotta go look.

588
00:52:28,524 --> 00:52:31,394
- Come on!
- Smash his face in!

589
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:42,661
Damn you!

590
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:45,531
Son of a bitch!

591
00:53:01,682 --> 00:53:05,098
- Marquis of Queensberry?
- Yeah.

592
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:17,480
Compliments of Mr. Jack Dempsey.

593
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:29,375
Ladies.

594
00:53:31,753 --> 00:53:37,340
You wait till I tell my brother!
You'll never work in this town again!

595
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:28,175
The guy is still out cold.

596
00:54:28,393 --> 00:54:29,852
You sure?

597
00:54:30,062 --> 00:54:33,395
Well, I kicked him.
He didn't seem to mind.

598
00:54:33,649 --> 00:54:36,104
He knows it was your Cadillac.

599
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:40,897
He knows you were at the Candy Store
the night Candy was killed.

600
00:54:41,114 --> 00:54:44,068
You better figure out
what to do with him.

601
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:47,155
I know what.
I just havert decided how.

602
00:54:55,087 --> 00:54:56,118
I'll be home.

603
00:54:56,338 --> 00:54:59,090
When you're finished,
call the station.

604
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:01,873
Get the car and then give us a hand.

605
00:55:02,094 --> 00:55:04,252
There's no "us." I'm out of this.

606
00:55:04,513 --> 00:55:06,552
You just give advice, huh?

607
00:55:06,807 --> 00:55:08,266
In this case, right.

608
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:12,010
In this case, wrong.
You're in this up to your badge.

609
00:55:12,271 --> 00:55:16,849
You stop playing, you're gonna
end up in somebody's meat locker.

610
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:22,192
- You can't intimidate me, Dutch.
- The fuck, I can't.

611
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:25,070
- You have a cat?
- Not that big.

612
00:56:30,098 --> 00:56:33,218
Trespassing. Assault.

613
00:56:33,435 --> 00:56:37,303
- That can get you hard time.
- Not if I shoot the witnesses.

614
00:56:37,564 --> 00:56:38,809
I doubt you will.

615
00:56:39,024 --> 00:56:43,353
You had me whipped and tied
like a calf ready to be branded.

616
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,231
Yeah, I did that.

617
00:56:45,489 --> 00:56:47,944
You broke in. I don't know you.

618
00:56:48,283 --> 00:56:50,240
I know who you are, Dutch.

619
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:53,246
If I was some unknown trespasser...

620
00:56:53,497 --> 00:56:58,953
...you'd have called the police
instead of tying me up and leaving me.

621
00:56:59,169 --> 00:57:01,292
That's Captain Blackwon'th.

622
00:57:01,547 --> 00:57:03,338
I know who he is.

623
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:05,583
Then do what you gotta do.

624
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:08,374
I'm gonna call your bluff and walk.

625
00:57:08,637 --> 00:57:11,045
When Captain Blackwon'th recovers...

626
00:57:11,306 --> 00:57:14,510
...I want you to persuade him to
lay off Cheryl.

627
00:57:14,893 --> 00:57:19,105
- I don't have that kind of influence.
- I think you do.

628
00:57:19,356 --> 00:57:21,183
Anyway, you try.

629
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:27,562
Because if Cheryl has any trouble
with Blackwon'th, or you, or anybody...

630
00:57:27,781 --> 00:57:30,865
...the DA is gonna get
a certain black book.

631
00:57:31,118 --> 00:57:33,905
I don't know what
you're talking about.

632
00:57:34,162 --> 00:57:38,575
- You're wasting time again.
- I don't know about any black book.

633
00:57:38,834 --> 00:57:40,245
Drop it!

634
00:57:41,753 --> 00:57:44,209
I'll kill you.

635
00:57:44,506 --> 00:57:46,665
Now, about that, I have influence.

636
00:57:47,217 --> 00:57:50,586
If he doesrt drop it by the time
I count three...

637
00:57:50,846 --> 00:57:52,554
...you kill him.

638
00:57:52,764 --> 00:57:53,927
One.

639
00:57:54,183 --> 00:57:55,677
Two.

640
00:57:59,521 --> 00:58:03,601
Now, what I got here is
a 12-gauge, full-choke shotgun.

641
00:58:03,817 --> 00:58:07,945
Go ahead and count three.
Let's see who gets killed first.

642
00:58:08,155 --> 00:58:10,278
Your call.

643
00:58:17,206 --> 00:58:19,282
Okay, I've made my point.

644
00:58:19,499 --> 00:58:21,658
You can take it or leave it.

645
00:58:21,919 --> 00:58:26,664
- Sorry we're on opposite sides.
- Well, that's usually the case.

646
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:30,708
And if you touch me again,
I'll kill you.

647
00:58:30,928 --> 00:58:33,632
Likewise, Mr. Earp.

648
00:58:34,181 --> 00:58:37,466
In an actor's world,
things arert what they seem.

649
00:58:37,684 --> 00:58:39,594
A pauper is a prince...

650
00:58:39,853 --> 00:58:43,637
...or a shotgun is a mop.

651
00:58:52,157 --> 00:58:54,482
- You'll have to give this up.
- Why?

652
00:58:54,701 --> 00:58:59,696
- You're gonna get yourself killed.
- People have said that for 50 years.

653
00:58:59,915 --> 00:59:02,667
Can we go someplace quiet to talk?

654
00:59:02,876 --> 00:59:04,252
Sure.

655
00:59:27,442 --> 00:59:28,474
Hey, Mix!

656
00:59:28,694 --> 00:59:31,398
Come on! Ho/a, Maria Chiquita.

657
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:35,569
- We dance later, okay, baby?
- Sure, baby.

658
00:59:37,244 --> 00:59:40,161
Tom Mix.

659
00:59:41,415 --> 00:59:43,953
I don't give a damn who he is!

660
00:59:44,209 --> 00:59:47,792
He broke in, he wrecked the place
and he insulted me!

661
00:59:48,046 --> 00:59:51,047
I want his damn legs broken!

662
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:54,550
He practically accused me
of killing Candy!

663
00:59:54,761 --> 00:59:56,671
Look, shut up.

664
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:59,765
Did you hear what I said?

665
01:00:00,017 --> 01:00:03,101
All right, I heard you.

666
01:00:04,605 --> 01:00:06,431
Jesus.

667
01:00:09,735 --> 01:00:11,692
- Hello.
- I'm at El Coyote.

668
01:00:11,945 --> 01:00:14,780
Mix just came in with Earp
and the girl.

669
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:19,735
There are a couple stunt riders here
that think Mix is a phony.

670
01:00:20,078 --> 01:00:23,245
If the price is right
they might prove it.

671
01:00:23,498 --> 01:00:25,787
Let me know what happens later.

672
01:00:26,001 --> 01:00:27,495
Right.

673
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:35,835
Well, are you going to take care
of Mix or do I have to tell Dutch?

674
01:00:46,438 --> 01:00:49,392
What I do is my business.

675
01:00:52,569 --> 01:00:57,564
- You're not gonna tell Dutch anything.
- The hell I'm not.

676
01:00:57,783 --> 01:01:00,155
Except what I want you to tell him.

677
01:01:00,369 --> 01:01:04,616
Otherwise, you're gonna have
two gimpy legs, little sister.

678
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:11,035
You're gonna go home.
You're gonna call the cops.

679
01:01:11,338 --> 01:01:14,956
Tell them that Tom Mix beat you up,
then raped you.

680
01:01:15,175 --> 01:01:18,176
They'll never believe me.

681
01:01:18,554 --> 01:01:20,463
They'll believe you.

682
01:01:20,973 --> 01:01:23,594
I want you to cry a lot...

683
01:01:23,851 --> 01:01:25,808
...and show them the bruises.

684
01:01:26,728 --> 01:01:28,804
Alfie!

685
01:01:37,114 --> 01:01:39,652
And they'll believe you.

686
01:03:22,553 --> 01:03:24,344
Bravo!

687
01:03:27,474 --> 01:03:29,965
Ride her, pardner.

688
01:04:40,214 --> 01:04:41,838
Bravo!

689
01:04:58,482 --> 01:05:01,234
Where did you learn
to dance like that?

690
01:05:01,485 --> 01:05:05,529
I fell in love with a lady
from Buenos Aires who believed...

691
01:05:05,739 --> 01:05:08,657
...a man wasrt a lover
unless he tangoed.

692
01:05:08,867 --> 01:05:11,572
- Not much choice.
- I took lessons.

693
01:05:11,787 --> 01:05:14,492
What was this lady's vocation?

694
01:05:14,706 --> 01:05:16,414
Tango instructor.

695
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:19,709
- Is that the truth?
- Hundred percent.

696
01:05:19,962 --> 01:05:22,001
Give or take a lie or two.

697
01:05:22,256 --> 01:05:24,711
- To honest men.
- And brave women.

698
01:05:24,967 --> 01:05:28,217
And friendships, tried and true.

699
01:05:35,394 --> 01:05:36,425
Hello, boys.

700
01:05:36,645 --> 01:05:40,974
We saw your wagon and thought
we'd tell you right to your face.

701
01:05:41,316 --> 01:05:45,444
- Tell me what?
- You're a half-breed candy ass.

702
01:05:45,654 --> 01:05:47,647
Not exactly a hot bulletin.

703
01:05:47,865 --> 01:05:51,649
That's why we hire fearless stuntmen
like yourselves.

704
01:05:51,869 --> 01:05:54,620
Mosey to the bar
and buy a drink on me.

705
01:05:54,913 --> 01:05:58,413
- We don't want a drink on you.
- We'll buy her a round.

706
01:05:58,709 --> 01:06:02,493
How about it? You want to have
a drink with real men...

707
01:06:02,713 --> 01:06:06,960
...instead of a half-breed candy ass
and his granddaddy?

708
01:06:07,176 --> 01:06:10,509
Before you make two big fools
of yourselves...

709
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:13,294
...I suggest you look under the table.

710
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:14,630
Do what?

711
01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:19,227
I'd do what he says. This here's
Wyatt Earp, famous lawman...

712
01:06:19,438 --> 01:06:25,191
...known to carry a pistol that he may
have snuck out as you picked a fight.

713
01:06:25,444 --> 01:06:27,602
Yeah, right. I know who he is.

714
01:06:27,821 --> 01:06:30,490
He didn't come in packing no hog leg.

715
01:06:30,699 --> 01:06:34,150
- I thought you were looking at my car.
- We wasrt.

716
01:06:34,411 --> 01:06:35,609
Earp or no Earp...

717
01:06:35,871 --> 01:06:39,156
...I bet you don't have a gun
under the table.

718
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:41,622
It's your funeral.

719
01:07:01,647 --> 01:07:06,688
- I'm going to kill you!
- One move and I'll pig-stick you!

720
01:07:06,944 --> 01:07:11,440
Now, take my advice and run,
while you still have your cojones.

721
01:07:17,162 --> 01:07:20,614
Hey, Mix, baby!

722
01:07:33,428 --> 01:07:35,504
Hello, Tom.

723
01:07:35,722 --> 01:07:37,514
Let's take a walk, Dib.

724
01:07:37,724 --> 01:07:39,183
Excuse me, darling.

725
01:07:39,393 --> 01:07:43,141
Me and Marvin got important
business to discuss.

726
01:07:43,397 --> 01:07:45,057
- What the hell...?
- Walk!

727
01:07:45,315 --> 01:07:46,893
- What did I do?
- Can it.

728
01:07:47,109 --> 01:07:49,600
You set me up with those stuntmen.

729
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:52,655
- Tom, l...
- You listen to me, you lying shit.

730
01:07:52,865 --> 01:07:56,150
I asked you for a favour.
Now I'm telling you.

731
01:07:56,368 --> 01:08:00,318
Get Alfie to lay off Wyatt
or the next time this happens...

732
01:08:00,539 --> 01:08:02,531
...l'll drag you down Sunset.

733
01:08:02,749 --> 01:08:06,284
Ain't gonna be enough hide on you
to patch a pinole.

734
01:08:06,461 --> 01:08:08,205
Just counselling the chief.

735
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:14,211
I'm a little more civilized than him,
and I want to get my two cents in.

736
01:08:14,428 --> 01:08:17,429
Give me trouble, I'll kill you,
understand?

737
01:08:17,639 --> 01:08:20,047
- Yes.
- Say it. Convince me.

738
01:08:20,267 --> 01:08:23,802
- Any more trouble, you'll kill me.
- I believe you.

739
01:08:24,021 --> 01:08:28,184
So from now on,
whether you live or die is up to you.

740
01:08:28,442 --> 01:08:32,142
Excuse me.
Can I go to the bathroom?

741
01:08:34,698 --> 01:08:37,154
We gotta get something straight.

742
01:08:37,367 --> 01:08:41,365
I threatened to drag him
and you threatened to kill him.

743
01:08:41,622 --> 01:08:45,489
- I don't like being out-threatened.
- Wort happen again.

744
01:08:45,709 --> 01:08:48,544
Bad as being upstaged.
I'm a movie star.

745
01:08:52,508 --> 01:08:53,836
Why are you here?

746
01:08:54,051 --> 01:08:56,624
You don't come here.
We had an agreement.

747
01:08:56,845 --> 01:08:58,221
Had an agreement.

748
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:00,589
What's that supposed to mean?

749
01:09:00,807 --> 01:09:04,342
Any agreement didn't include
you beating Victoria.

750
01:09:04,561 --> 01:09:06,139
What? What do you...?

751
01:09:06,355 --> 01:09:08,976
- Did Victoria tell you that?
- She did.

752
01:09:09,233 --> 01:09:12,815
She fingered Mix,
but I know what really happened.

753
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:15,442
And how do you know?

754
01:09:15,656 --> 01:09:17,529
A year ago we made a deal.

755
01:09:17,783 --> 01:09:21,781
I don't deal with anyone
I don't know everything about.

756
01:09:21,995 --> 01:09:24,035
I know who and what you are.

757
01:09:24,248 --> 01:09:28,376
I knew a guy like you
when I was starting. Cocky guy.

758
01:09:28,585 --> 01:09:30,459
Wore spats and a derby.

759
01:09:30,963 --> 01:09:33,714
He used to brag about how smart he was.

760
01:09:33,966 --> 01:09:37,216
Till someone shot him in the mouth.

761
01:09:37,886 --> 01:09:40,971
If Mix is arrested,
what happens to his movie?

762
01:09:41,473 --> 01:09:45,601
I'll close down for a few days.
We'll recast.

763
01:09:45,811 --> 01:09:48,053
Tom Mix will be washed up.

764
01:09:48,355 --> 01:09:51,273
Provided he's found guilty.

765
01:09:51,483 --> 01:09:53,725
The press will find him guilty.

766
01:09:53,986 --> 01:09:57,070
Blackwon'th's arresting Mix is okay.

767
01:09:57,322 --> 01:10:00,738
But not until I get
Candy's little black book.

768
01:10:00,951 --> 01:10:03,620
- How will you do that?
- Nancy Shoemaker.

769
01:10:03,829 --> 01:10:06,498
Mix is hiding her up at his ranch.

770
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:13,126
A woman called, but wouldn't
leave her name. She sounded disturbed.

771
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:16,879
- You didn't recognize the voice?
- It was English.

772
01:10:17,092 --> 01:10:20,591
She asked if you could be reached.

773
01:10:20,804 --> 01:10:22,880
I'll get it.

774
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:24,421
Hello.

775
01:10:24,641 --> 01:10:26,433
- Tom.
- Yes?

776
01:10:26,643 --> 01:10:29,134
This is Christina.

777
01:10:30,022 --> 01:10:33,806
Dutch Kieffer knows you've got Nancy
up at the ranch...

778
01:10:41,783 --> 01:10:44,488
Strap on your iron, we're saving Nancy.

779
01:11:00,761 --> 01:11:02,919
This here is my flying buddy!

780
01:11:03,138 --> 01:11:04,882
- Wyatt, Cheryl!
- Hi!

781
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:07,133
What about the funeral?

782
01:11:07,392 --> 01:11:10,678
If you're not back,
take Cheryl to the funeral!

783
01:11:10,938 --> 01:11:13,773
Come on, Wyatt! We gotta go!

784
01:11:20,155 --> 01:11:22,314
- You ever done any flying?
- Nope!

785
01:11:22,533 --> 01:11:24,193
Me neither!

786
01:11:24,451 --> 01:11:27,785
- It's still dark!
- It'll be dawn in 10 minutes!

787
01:11:28,038 --> 01:11:30,659
Fasten your seat belt!

788
01:12:40,068 --> 01:12:42,394
How much further?

789
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:44,190
About 50 miles.

790
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:12,425
Oh, shit!

791
01:13:37,709 --> 01:13:39,951
What do you think you're doing?

792
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:42,875
Mostly trying to stay alive.

793
01:13:43,507 --> 01:13:45,298
Hey, I know you.

794
01:13:45,509 --> 01:13:47,300
- Ain't you...?
- Yeah.

795
01:13:47,553 --> 01:13:49,047
That's Tom Mix.

796
01:13:49,304 --> 01:13:52,590
Wyatt, I want you to meet...
What are your names?

797
01:13:52,808 --> 01:13:55,299
- This is Henry.
- And this is Fred.

798
01:13:55,519 --> 01:13:58,140
I want you to meet Wyatt Earp.

799
01:13:58,397 --> 01:14:00,685
- Wyatt?
- Earp?

800
01:14:00,899 --> 01:14:02,607
Morning, boys.

801
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:05,896
- Where are we?
- Now you're on the Circle C.

802
01:14:06,113 --> 01:14:08,948
About 15 miles southeast
of your spread.

803
01:14:09,157 --> 01:14:13,535
We sure would appreciate the loan
of a couple fast horses.

804
01:14:57,122 --> 01:15:01,072
I'm getting to where I can't
even stay on a horse.

805
01:15:01,919 --> 01:15:03,995
Go on!

806
01:15:27,736 --> 01:15:30,108
Hey, what do you want?

807
01:15:30,364 --> 01:15:32,107
What do you want?

808
01:16:11,822 --> 01:16:16,567
Let go of me, you big bastard!

809
01:16:25,878 --> 01:16:29,827
- You'll be all right?
- I'd feel better if they was a camera.

810
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:32,415
Let's get her done.

811
01:16:34,428 --> 01:16:36,219
Get in the car!

812
01:16:36,471 --> 01:16:39,093
Get in there and shut up!

813
01:16:40,058 --> 01:16:42,431
Spread out!

814
01:17:06,293 --> 01:17:08,914
Get off me!

815
01:17:21,683 --> 01:17:23,343
My God!

816
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:24,971
Wyatt.

817
01:17:25,187 --> 01:17:27,559
Well, you done good, pardner.

818
01:17:27,773 --> 01:17:31,640
Of course, a couple more inches...

819
01:17:38,742 --> 01:17:41,826
To assure the resurrection
to eternal life...

820
01:17:42,037 --> 01:17:44,326
...through the Lord, Jesus Christ...

821
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:48,584
...we commend thee, Almighty God,
our sister, Candace Girard.

822
01:17:48,836 --> 01:17:50,875
We commit her to the ground.

823
01:17:51,088 --> 01:17:55,833
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

824
01:17:56,093 --> 01:17:58,465
- Amen.
- Amen.

825
01:18:01,014 --> 01:18:03,766
Bless you, my child.

826
01:18:05,894 --> 01:18:08,219
Cheryl King?

827
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,511
Yes.

828
01:18:09,773 --> 01:18:13,818
I would've given you this sooner,
but I couldn't find you.

829
01:18:14,069 --> 01:18:15,647
My card.

830
01:18:15,863 --> 01:18:20,026
If you need help, please call.

831
01:18:30,294 --> 01:18:32,333
I'm sorry.

832
01:18:36,133 --> 01:18:40,047
- A man gave me this envelope.
- Open it.

833
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:43,930
You know a Leo Vogel, attorney?

834
01:18:44,183 --> 01:18:45,558
No.

835
01:18:47,394 --> 01:18:49,600
It's a safety deposit box key.

836
01:18:49,813 --> 01:18:52,387
I'm glad you boys finally showed up.

837
01:18:52,649 --> 01:18:55,271
What are you doing here, Blackwon'th?

838
01:18:55,485 --> 01:18:59,020
I'm about to arrest America's
favourite star cowboy...

839
01:18:59,239 --> 01:19:01,564
...for felonious assault and rape.

840
01:19:01,783 --> 01:19:03,859
Unless you try to stop me.

841
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:06,325
And I hope you do.

842
01:19:06,538 --> 01:19:07,617
Rape?

843
01:19:07,873 --> 01:19:10,115
You're kidding. Who did I rape?

844
01:19:10,667 --> 01:19:13,752
You'll find out about
that at the station.

845
01:19:14,004 --> 01:19:16,127
Let's go.

846
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:17,585
I'm primed.

847
01:19:17,799 --> 01:19:19,709
You wanna take him?

848
01:19:19,927 --> 01:19:23,545
I'd like to, but he's not won'th it.

849
01:19:26,934 --> 01:19:29,685
You bit off more than you can chew.

850
01:19:29,895 --> 01:19:32,600
Call my lawyer, Saul Rosenstein.

851
01:19:32,856 --> 01:19:35,727
I'll be all right, honey.
You go with them.

852
01:19:38,529 --> 01:19:42,443
I'd run you and your
lesbo girlfriend out of town...

853
01:19:42,699 --> 01:19:45,819
...but you made some
dangerous enemies here.

854
01:19:46,036 --> 01:19:50,532
I'm looking forward to what's
gonna happen when they catch you.

855
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,289
How's your nose?

856
01:19:55,504 --> 01:19:58,873
Get out of here,
before I forget I'm a lawman.

857
01:19:59,091 --> 01:20:02,092
I don't think you
killed half those men.

858
01:20:02,302 --> 01:20:07,213
And the ones you did kill,
I bet you shot them in the back.

859
01:20:09,977 --> 01:20:13,511
Let's find out, you son of a bitch.
Draw.

860
01:20:20,737 --> 01:20:22,896
My men will cut you to ribbons.

861
01:20:23,365 --> 01:20:27,030
Not before I shoot out your eyes.

862
01:20:35,252 --> 01:20:37,660
Another time.

863
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:52,509
- Would you have killed him?
- No.

864
01:20:52,728 --> 01:20:53,759
Why?

865
01:20:53,979 --> 01:20:56,648
I'm not packing a gun.

866
01:21:02,487 --> 01:21:06,865
- Hey, ain't you Tom Mix?
- I sure am, pardner.

867
01:21:08,076 --> 01:21:11,196
Tom, you need a new sidekick?

868
01:21:19,087 --> 01:21:22,955
- Can I get you anything?
- I don't expect to be here long.

869
01:21:23,133 --> 01:21:25,541
Don't count on it.

870
01:21:26,887 --> 01:21:30,837
- Hello, Michael. How are you, boy?
- Not very well.

871
01:21:31,016 --> 01:21:34,100
- Mind if I ask you a question?
- Yes, I was framed.

872
01:21:34,478 --> 01:21:35,937
Who'd do that?

873
01:21:36,104 --> 01:21:40,434
Whoever got the bartender to drug me,
then had me go to Candy's.

874
01:21:40,651 --> 01:21:43,770
- And you found her dead.
- No.

875
01:21:44,571 --> 01:21:48,023
She said, "Never trust an Alperin,"
then she died.

876
01:21:48,367 --> 01:21:54,737
She was trying to name the killer. She
just didn't have time to be specific.

877
01:21:54,915 --> 01:21:59,292
You can take your pick, though.
I mean, there are four Alperins.

878
01:21:59,461 --> 01:22:04,088
Well, three, if my mother
decides to narrow the field.

879
01:22:04,341 --> 01:22:06,084
What do you mean?

880
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:07,920
You didn't hear?

881
01:22:09,388 --> 01:22:13,220
She's in the hospital.
She's not expected to live.

882
01:22:41,962 --> 01:22:44,797
How much do you think there is?

883
01:22:44,965 --> 01:22:47,041
Maybe this'll help.

884
01:22:59,938 --> 01:23:01,812
"Hi, baby.

885
01:23:01,982 --> 01:23:05,731
The man who gave you this
key is an old friend...

886
01:23:05,903 --> 01:23:08,228
...and a good lawyer.

887
01:23:09,406 --> 01:23:14,649
If you need any help or advice after
you read this, give him a call.

888
01:23:14,828 --> 01:23:18,280
They say that confession
is good for the soul...

889
01:23:18,457 --> 01:23:20,782
...so here goes.

890
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:27,048
On August 11 th, 1916...

891
01:23:27,841 --> 01:23:31,341
...I was a guest aboard
Alfie Alperirs yacht...

892
01:23:31,512 --> 01:23:35,011
...which was returning from Catalina.

893
01:23:35,807 --> 01:23:40,553
I witnessed Alfie Alperin fighting
with his first wife.

894
01:23:41,688 --> 01:23:45,935
Then he hit her,
and pushed her overboard.

895
01:23:47,152 --> 01:23:49,275
When he saw me...

896
01:23:50,572 --> 01:23:53,242
...I was sure he was going to kill me.

897
01:23:53,408 --> 01:23:55,068
Instead...

898
01:23:55,244 --> 01:23:58,992
...he led me to his cabin,
where he beat me...

899
01:23:59,164 --> 01:24:01,121
...and raped me.

900
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:04,458
Afterwards, he said that if I kept
my mouth shut...

901
01:24:04,628 --> 01:24:07,582
...he would set me up in business.

902
01:24:09,007 --> 01:24:12,756
Now, baby, I want you to give this...

903
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:16,546
...give this letter
to the district attorney.

904
01:24:17,266 --> 01:24:19,507
It will protect you."

905
01:24:27,067 --> 01:24:30,234
It's an exciting evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

906
01:24:30,445 --> 01:24:34,823
We expect a gala turnout tonight
of major stars.

907
01:24:34,992 --> 01:24:38,443
Arriving now is Mr. Alfie Alperin.

908
01:24:48,755 --> 01:24:50,878
No statement right now, okay?

909
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:21,694
The press conference is all set.

910
01:25:22,372 --> 01:25:24,164
Any other news?

911
01:25:34,259 --> 01:25:36,133
What's wrong?

912
01:25:37,721 --> 01:25:40,888
Mix and Wyatt are at the hospital.

913
01:25:41,308 --> 01:25:43,514
Can they hurt you?

914
01:25:48,232 --> 01:25:50,604
I better get dressed.

915
01:26:03,705 --> 01:26:08,663
So silly, losing my balance
and falling over like that.

916
01:26:11,088 --> 01:26:13,080
Is that you, Tom?

917
01:26:13,757 --> 01:26:15,631
Yes, Christina.

918
01:26:18,053 --> 01:26:22,181
I saw Michael. He sends his love.

919
01:26:25,435 --> 01:26:29,848
- He didn't kill that girl, did he?
- No.

920
01:26:30,023 --> 01:26:34,685
No, I'm sure Alfie killed her,
just like I'm sure he did this to you.

921
01:26:34,862 --> 01:26:37,103
Why do you protect him?

922
01:26:41,201 --> 01:26:42,993
Because...

923
01:26:44,204 --> 01:26:46,576
...he's not Michael's father.

924
01:26:46,748 --> 01:26:53,118
He promised me that if I married him,
he'd raise Michael as his own son.

925
01:26:54,423 --> 01:26:57,626
I guess for a while he even tried.

926
01:26:57,801 --> 01:27:01,633
But the thought of another man...

927
01:27:03,182 --> 01:27:08,306
Then, when the doctor
told him that we...

928
01:27:09,104 --> 01:27:13,517
That he couldn't have children...

929
01:27:13,692 --> 01:27:16,313
...he grew to hate Michael.

930
01:27:17,487 --> 01:27:20,773
I did everything I could
to protect him.

931
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:25,326
What about Michael's real father?

932
01:27:26,455 --> 01:27:28,032
He never knew.

933
01:27:36,173 --> 01:27:40,171
I don't seem to have had much luck
with my men, have I, Wyatt?

934
01:27:45,432 --> 01:27:47,472
I'm so tired.

935
01:27:48,644 --> 01:27:50,636
Try to rest.

936
01:27:52,689 --> 01:27:55,893
He'll never bother you again, my dear.

937
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:10,403
Welcome to the first annual
Academy Awards.

938
01:28:16,797 --> 01:28:20,841
Before we start handing out
our little statuettes...

939
01:28:21,009 --> 01:28:24,628
...I wanna introduce
an entrepreneur...

940
01:28:24,847 --> 01:28:30,221
...a brilliant clown who retired his
tuxedo coat and baggy pants...

941
01:28:30,435 --> 01:28:34,516
...and is now one of Hollywood's
most successful producers.

942
01:28:34,690 --> 01:28:39,435
Known by millions of his adoring fans
as "The Happy Hobo":

943
01:28:39,611 --> 01:28:42,281
Mr. Alfie Alperin.

944
01:29:03,385 --> 01:29:06,054
- Landmark in Hollywood history.

945
01:29:06,221 --> 01:29:09,388
Arriving now, we can see Tom Mix.

946
01:29:09,558 --> 01:29:13,935
But who's that he's got in the car
with him? It's Wyatt Earp!

947
01:30:33,475 --> 01:30:35,017
Thank you.

948
01:30:39,231 --> 01:30:42,066
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

949
01:30:42,234 --> 01:30:45,021
Thank you for remembering.

950
01:30:48,407 --> 01:30:53,911
Congratulations
to all of us here today...

951
01:30:54,496 --> 01:30:59,538
...for being here to celebrate this
most important event for our industry.

952
01:31:03,172 --> 01:31:05,294
As some of you know...

953
01:31:06,508 --> 01:31:10,838
...my dearest wife, Christina,
is seriously ill in the hospital.

954
01:31:11,013 --> 01:31:17,133
So unfortunately, I'm gonna have to
leave before you honour the winners.

955
01:31:17,311 --> 01:31:21,807
Let me just say this in parting:
Have fun, enjoy yourselves...

956
01:31:21,982 --> 01:31:25,565
...and those who are
working at Alperin, my studio...

957
01:31:25,736 --> 01:31:31,240
... especially the ladies,
don't stay up too late, all right?

958
01:31:31,408 --> 01:31:34,907
Enjoy yourselves. God bless.
Have fun.

959
01:32:06,026 --> 01:32:07,769
Alperin?

960
01:32:09,154 --> 01:32:11,361
I'm taking you in.

961
01:32:11,532 --> 01:32:14,782
How can you do that?
You're not the law here.

962
01:32:14,952 --> 01:32:19,364
No, just a citizen making sure
a murderer doesrt escape.

963
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:21,449
I'll shoot if I have to.

964
01:32:24,753 --> 01:32:26,461
You're insane.

965
01:32:27,798 --> 01:32:32,792
This is Candace Girard's confession.
She saw you murder your first wife.

966
01:32:34,054 --> 01:32:38,348
You're making a scene, Mr. Earp.
Walk with me to the stairs.

967
01:32:38,517 --> 01:32:40,426
If I don't?

968
01:32:40,602 --> 01:32:44,267
I killed Candy.
I've got nothing to lose.

969
01:32:44,439 --> 01:32:47,109
- Victoria.
- Go on, Alfie.

970
01:32:47,568 --> 01:32:49,607
Get out of here, Alfie.

971
01:32:49,945 --> 01:32:52,151
Walk to the stairs.

972
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:05,160
You couldn't have beaten
Candace up like that.

973
01:33:05,335 --> 01:33:09,167
You and Dutch find her
after Alfie got through with her?

974
01:33:09,339 --> 01:33:13,966
- Finish her off with an ice pick?
- And I loved every minute of it.

975
01:33:15,012 --> 01:33:18,879
Hold it right there, Earp.
Get your hands up.

976
01:33:19,933 --> 01:33:23,634
Get away from him, Miss Alperin.
Dib, get his gun.

977
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:33,145
We got a report from Paso Robles.
Four men were killed at Mix's ranch.

978
01:33:33,322 --> 01:33:36,572
- Yep.
- You admit you know about it?

979
01:33:36,742 --> 01:33:40,989
Sure. I killed them. Well, two
of them. Tom got the other two.

980
01:33:43,248 --> 01:33:46,249
- I arrest you for murder.
- Let's go.

981
01:33:46,418 --> 01:33:48,327
Get back!

982
01:33:48,504 --> 01:33:51,255
- What the hell?
- Interesting development.

983
01:33:51,423 --> 01:33:53,546
- Get out of the way.
- He can't.

984
01:33:53,759 --> 01:33:55,218
- What's this?
- Vickie.

985
01:33:55,385 --> 01:33:59,383
- He can hurt Alfie. I won't let him.
- But not like this.

986
01:33:59,556 --> 01:34:02,676
- We'll take care of him.
- She killed Candy.

987
01:34:02,851 --> 01:34:04,891
Alfie has paid you a fortune.

988
01:34:05,062 --> 01:34:08,727
- Just go down the stairs!
- There's too many witnesses.

989
01:34:08,899 --> 01:34:10,773
- Miss Alperin...
- No!

990
01:34:19,618 --> 01:34:23,450
- Victoria!
- No, Dutch. It's gone too far. Go away.

991
01:34:23,997 --> 01:34:26,868
- Oh, Christ.
- You son of a bitch!

992
01:34:29,711 --> 01:34:31,503
No! Dutch!

993
01:34:45,102 --> 01:34:49,396
- Dutch, give me the gun.
- Tom, go get Alfie.

994
01:34:52,067 --> 01:34:53,775
It hurts.

995
01:34:54,444 --> 01:34:56,935
Why did you kill Candy?

996
01:34:58,031 --> 01:35:03,951
She was gonna tell about
what happened on the boat.

997
01:35:04,121 --> 01:35:07,122
I had to protect Alfie.

998
01:35:09,668 --> 01:35:12,752
You don't understand, do you?

999
01:35:14,131 --> 01:35:16,005
Sometimes...

1000
01:35:16,842 --> 01:35:20,092
...bad people like me and Alfie...

1001
01:35:21,263 --> 01:35:24,299
...only have each other.

1002
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:30,392
Daddy. Daddy...

1003
01:36:05,432 --> 01:36:10,390
Go! Don't slow down for anything.
Get me to the boat as fast as you can.

1004
01:36:10,562 --> 01:36:14,145
- Did you hear about Mrs. Alperin?
- No.

1005
01:36:14,316 --> 01:36:17,352
It was on the radio. She died.

1006
01:36:17,528 --> 01:36:19,022
Just step on it!

1007
01:36:29,081 --> 01:36:31,619
I think we're being followed.

1008
01:36:39,132 --> 01:36:41,802
Come on. Can't you shake him?

1009
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:47,469
Just get me to the boat quickly.
It's all I ask.

1010
01:36:47,641 --> 01:36:50,310
You stop this goon behind us...

1011
01:36:50,477 --> 01:36:54,605
...or you're gonna see the inside
of Folsom for a long time.

1012
01:36:54,773 --> 01:36:58,142
Do you hear me, Arthur?
Do you hear me?

1013
01:37:32,311 --> 01:37:35,477
Where are you going?
You passed the boat!

1014
01:37:35,814 --> 01:37:39,515
Hey! Son of a bitch! No! No! No!

1015
01:37:39,818 --> 01:37:40,849
No!

1016
01:38:09,473 --> 01:38:11,679
- Help! Help!
- Shit!

1017
01:38:11,975 --> 01:38:14,466
- I can't swim!
- Hang on, Arthur!

1018
01:38:14,770 --> 01:38:16,809
Help! Help!

1019
01:38:29,284 --> 01:38:30,944
Relax!

1020
01:38:43,298 --> 01:38:45,624
- You okay, Mr. Mix?
- I'm all right.

1021
01:38:45,801 --> 01:38:49,633
- What about Mr. Alperin?
- Better call the police.

1022
01:38:49,805 --> 01:38:52,378
Sorry.
You'd have drowned us both.

1023
01:38:52,558 --> 01:38:55,642
Better to drown.
They'll put me away for life!

1024
01:38:55,811 --> 01:38:58,302
- Think you can walk?
- Yeah.

1025
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:00,224
Then why don't you start?

1026
01:39:00,399 --> 01:39:04,728
Keep walking till you find a place
you want to start a new life.

1027
01:39:04,903 --> 01:39:06,563
You mean it?

1028
01:39:07,948 --> 01:39:12,610
I'm the hero, Arthur.
I always mean what I say.

1029
01:39:12,786 --> 01:39:14,695
Thanks.

1030
01:39:14,872 --> 01:39:18,821
Por nada, amigo. Get going.

1031
01:40:29,279 --> 01:40:31,605
You know something, pardner?

1032
01:40:32,991 --> 01:40:36,775
You're developing a real knack
for upstaging me.

1033
01:41:14,283 --> 01:41:18,779
Some folks would rest
a whole lot easier if you burned this.

1034
01:41:18,954 --> 01:41:22,489
Or I could open up
the Candy Store again.

1035
01:41:22,666 --> 01:41:24,493
That you could.

1036
01:41:26,503 --> 01:41:28,295
Got a match?

1037
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:37,297
All aboard!

1038
01:41:39,391 --> 01:41:41,182
Come back.

1039
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:43,351
You never know.

1040
01:41:48,442 --> 01:41:51,478
Now you take care
of that big guy, will you?

1041
01:41:51,653 --> 01:41:54,773
- I'll miss you.
- And I'll miss you.

1042
01:41:59,077 --> 01:42:00,536
Michael.

1043
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:04,536
I'll tell you like I told your mother
a long time ago.

1044
01:42:04,708 --> 01:42:08,159
If you ever need help,
you know where to find me.

1045
01:42:08,337 --> 01:42:10,045
Yes, sir.

1046
01:42:14,218 --> 01:42:16,009
All aboard!

1047
01:42:24,853 --> 01:42:26,561
So long, pardner.

1048
01:42:27,439 --> 01:42:29,266
Adiós, amigo.

1049
01:46:58,502 --> 01:46:59,332
