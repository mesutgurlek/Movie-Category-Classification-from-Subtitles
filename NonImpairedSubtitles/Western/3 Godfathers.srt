1
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,078
Fill up the canteens, Kid.
And don't forget that big water bag.

2
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,593
All right, Bob.

3
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,630
-Is that the place?
-That's it.

4
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,109
-Where's the bank? At this end of town?
-Me? I don't know.

5
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,553
The last time I was there,
there was nothing...

6
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,517
no bank, no railroad.

7
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,392
There was a little cantina...

8
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,517
and the most beautiful girl
named Josefina, that played the guitar.

9
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,239
We're robbing a bank,
not looking up old friends.

10
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,154
Yes, I know.
But I sure wish we were rustling cows.

11
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,752
-You want to change your mind, too, Kid?
-Not me.

12
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,559
Well, you better think it over.
I hate to take you along.

13
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,029
This is no cinch, like rustling a few cows.

14
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,918
I thought it over, Bob,
and I ain't backing down.

15
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,797
No, sir, I ain't backing down.

16
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,316
Look, Kid, the border's over yonder,
just 60 miles.

17
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,188
Why don't you light out?
We'll join you. Promise you.

18
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,472
I ain't backing down.

19
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,278
Then remember...

20
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,352
all you do is hold the horses. No shooting.

21
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,398
Well, at least the cows,
they don't shoot back.

22
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,154
Mount up.

23
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,551
That's right friendly of them.

24
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,228
I know why I didn't recognize him.

25
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,109
She has changed his name.
She used to call him ''Tarantula.''

26
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,352
You know, a big bug with legs.

27
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,035
''Welcome'' is more neighborly, right, Kid?

28
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,599
Yeah, I guess so.

29
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,555
Yeah, I'm Sweet. Looking for me?

30
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,912
No, neighbor. Just admiring your shingle.

31
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,760
That's a mighty pretty name, B. Sweet.

32
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,435
You fellas come in with that cattle outfit?

33
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,159
No, just riding through. Little business.

34
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,029
Cattle?

35
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,832
Talked about it some.

36
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,512
<i>What happened, man?</i>

37
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,359
<i>Nothing, sir.</i>

38
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,636
Perley, come get your breakfast.

39
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,712
Perley Sweet?
Now, that is a right pretty name!

40
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,157
She just calls me that.

41
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,840
Most everybody calls me Buck.
Buck Sweet.

42
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,832
I didn't know you had company.

43
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,753
Just passing the time of day
with these here cowpokes.

44
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,434
Ma, why don't you fetch us
some coffee out here?

45
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,351
I'd be mighty proud to.

46
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,753
You not only got a pretty name,
Mr. Sweet.

47
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,434
-You got a mighty pretty wife.
-Thank you.

48
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,275
She's a little sprung now, but I'll tell you...

49
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,796
that little woman used to be
the best dancer in this whole territory.

50
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,838
I’ll bet you were
mighty spry yourself, Perley.

51
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,834
I could kick a little.
Why don't you fellas light?

52
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,191
No, we better be moving on.

53
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,918
If you're looking for work...

54
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,992
you'll find most of the cattlemen
down by the bank.

55
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,038
-Where is that?
-Right down the street a piece.

56
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,114
Now, you boys have some hot coffee.
I know you've been riding a long ways.

57
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,191
And I can tell you're from Texas
by your hats.

58
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,748
Yes, ma'am. We're from Texas, all right.

59
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,439
Besides, you're carrying slickers.
Don't rain much in these parts.

60
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,194
Did you come in by the Old Mormon Trail?

61
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,355
-Yes, ma'am, we did.
-Didn't use much water. Got a full bag.

62
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,640
Did you happen to meet up
with my niece and her husband?

63
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,678
They're coming out
by the way of New Jerusalem.

64
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,034
No, ma'am, we didn't.

65
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,395
I don't see
how they could have missed them.

66
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,358
They're coming out by wagon,
and expecting them for Christmas.

67
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,513
Perley went up in the mountains
and cut a big piney tree this morning.

68
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,431
Do you think that he could have missed
the turnoff at Terrapin Tanks?

69
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,557
Be just like him to.
Never knew such a shiftless fella.

70
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,596
Tried everything but preaching.

71
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,355
It don't take much brains to drive a wagon
from New Jerusalem to Welcome.

72
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,193
-If he did, he'd never get here.
-Another cup?

73
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,034
No, thanks.

74
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,635
Say, I bet you put eggshells in
to settle the grounds, like Ma used to do.

75
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,076
-'Course I do. Where you from, son?
-From Abilene.

76
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,999
And what's your name?

77
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,311
My name's William,
but everybody calls me ''The Abilene Kid.''

78
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,038
I bet they called you ''carrot-tops''
when you went to school.

79
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,680
-''Brick-top,'' ma'am.
-They did? Me, too.

80
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,832
Thanks for stopping by, boys.

81
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,309
-Coffee was real nice.
-Mighty nice, ma'am.

82
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,628
<i>Thank you very much, ma 'am.</i>

83
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,029
I’m sure proud
to have made your acquaintance, ma'am.

84
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,553
Thank you, son.

85
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,397
Well, Perley, thanks.

86
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,832
Hope you have
a nice crop of apples this fall....

87
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,234
I’ll be seeing you boys, probably.

88
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,755
I do declare,
but you're a sight for sore eyes!

89
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,559
You kind of
got the advantage of me, ma'am.

90
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,111
I mean all of you. I’m so sick of the East.

91
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,950
For the past two years,
I've been back east in Denver, Colorado...

92
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,190
hobbled up in a boarding school...

93
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,590
till I just love the sight
of anything sitting a horse.

94
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,792
-And that Charro saddle!
-See, Bob?

95
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,308
And what is your lovely name, <i>seòorita?</i>

96
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,234
My name? Lordy, my father's
president of the bank. Tolliver Latham.

97
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,074
-I expect you do business with him.
-We aim to, ma'am.

98
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,632
Ruby, my girl!

99
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,958
Welcome. Welcome to Welcome!

100
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,832
Welcome home, Miss Ruby.

101
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,837
Remember, Kid, you don't do no shooting.

102
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,719
I thought so.

103
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,392
Real desperado type.

104
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,472
Pete, quick, get on your horse!

105
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,355
-Sorry, Miss Crumly.
-Tell me what's the matter.

106
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,670
Little bank robbery. Come on, get going!

107
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,231
Come on, Kid! Step up!

108
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,913
Haul it, Pete!

109
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,993
Get those bandits!
Don't let them get away!

110
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,039
Blast one at 'em, Pete. Hang on, Kid.

111
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,274
Again, Pete.

112
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,999
Pull up, men.

113
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,633
-Gosh, Marshal, you missed them.
-They ain't paying me to kill folks.

114
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,594
Them Texas boys gonna be mighty thirsty
before they get to water.

115
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,433
-Back to the depot, Curly.
-The depot?

116
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,348
Yeah, the depot. The railroad depot.

117
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,075
Giddup.

118
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,033
You hurt bad, Kid?

119
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,790
-No, but I bled like a stuck pig.
-Don't try to talk, Kid.

120
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,916
That Perley character....

121
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,388
You know, he busted that on purpose.

122
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,072
Take a mouthful, Kid.

123
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,959
That's enough.

124
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,640
All right, men, raise your right hand.

125
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,880
As duly appointed Marshal
of the territory of Arizona...

126
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,635
I hereby deputize you
for the sum of $3 a day to find--

127
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,674
-Hey, watch them pack mules, will you?
-I’m doing the best I can.

128
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,594
Come on along, girl.

129
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,478
You unload them pack horses.
Get them on there.

130
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,110
Come on, Curly, I’m late!

131
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,272
-Come on, Curly, get them mules.
-Now, where was l?

132
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,272
Say, Buck, I thought
we were gonna get $5 a day.

133
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,750
I don't spend tax money that easy.
$3 a day and found.

134
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,748
Now, you solemnly swear
to uphold and enforce the law. Say, ''I do.''

135
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,114
-I do.
-Good.

136
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,796
Can I drag it now, Buck?
I’m eight hours late now.

137
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,713
Don't bust your bellyband, Luke.
We'll be aboard.

138
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,916
-Marshal.
-Yes, Mr. Latham?

139
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,876
Shouldn't you deputize more men?

140
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,077
The bank can't risk
letting these desperadoes escape.

141
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,388
Sets a bad example.

142
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,598
I don't want you to fret none, Mr. Latham,
but if it's gonna worry you....

143
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,148
Boys, Mr. Latham here
just put up a reward.

144
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,471
$100, dead or alive,
for every one of them poor fellas.

145
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,519
-Thank you, Mr. Latham !
-You got them for $100.

146
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,318
Thank you, Luke.

147
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,398
Good luck, Marshal!

148
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,311
Give the Kid a swig of water, Pete.

149
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,234
Drink it up, Kid.

150
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,437
Plenty more when we get to
Mojave Tanks. Drink it up!

151
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,432
There she is, fellas.

152
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,437
There she is, Mojave Tanks!

153
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,594
Water, Kid.

154
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,869
Water.

155
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,751
A thousand gallons of it.

156
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,513
You're gonna feel a whole lot better,
a whole lot cooler...

157
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,353
once we wash up that shoulder.
Go ahead, Kid.

158
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,553
Boy! I’m gonna skin me down to the hide...

159
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,909
climb up that ladder,
and dive in that tank, right to the bottom.

160
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,873
Never come up!

161
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,671
<i>Gosh!</i> That a man should have
such a great big thirst like I have...

162
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,195
and only water to quench it with.

163
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,316
<i>Anyway, cheers, friends.</i>

164
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,314
Get down.

165
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,113
Ain't no sign of anything.

166
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,590
But that's no guarantee they ain't around.
You boys keep your eyes open.

167
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,830
-Sure, Buck.
-You mind what I told you, now.

168
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,435
At night, two men stay awake while
one sleeps. They won't rush two of you.

169
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,954
-I’d like to see them try it.
-Just don't get careless.

170
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,315
Ben, I’ll take that deck of cards
in your pocket.

171
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,393
I ain't paying you pitch players
to sit in the shade all day and claim low.

172
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,119
-Shall I drag her, Buck?
-Drag it, Luke.

173
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,679
Drag her, Jake!

174
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,636
<i>Sons of bitches!</i> Let's rush them.

175
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,509
Six-shooters against Winchesters?

176
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,678
I’ve seen enough.

177
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,835
That Perley character.... Tin star.

178
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,548
A lot smarter than I thought.
Well, let's take a look at it.

179
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,597
Up here's where we come from. Welcome.

180
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,351
Railroad winds around and makes a bend
here at Mojave Tanks, where we are now.

181
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,153
Then it moseys off again to the southeast.

182
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,798
Down here's the Mexican border.

183
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,632
-50 miles, I figure.
-60.

184
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,199
How's 60, then?

185
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,990
So that Perley character
starts playing checkers with us.

186
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,868
He figures we'll head this way, and right.
It's the first water.

187
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,397
So he jumps us
and stakes out his deputies. No water.

188
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,234
So he figures our next move
will be up to Apache Wells.

189
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,275
Right.

190
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,238
So he jumps on his freight car
and heads that way.

191
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,675
And he'll be there, setting waiting.

192
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,036
He can keep squatting on his hunkers
from now till Christmas...

193
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,758
'cause we ain't gonna be there.

194
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,673
We're doubling back on our tracks
to Terrapin Tanks.

195
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,672
-But that's up to the north.
-We'll get our water.

196
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,793
We'll hole up in the piney woods
until the Kid feels better.

197
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,315
Then while that marshal's sitting,
getting calluses on his rump...

198
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,231
we'll set out to the east...

199
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,595
jump the tracks there,
and be over the border.

200
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,229
Yes, that's good.
But where are we gonna get some water?

201
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,115
It looks like you and me are gonna chew
a lot of barrelhead cactus...

202
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,838
if we can find any.

203
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,998
Kid gets the canteen.

204
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,597
All right, Kid. Come on.

205
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,633
Get in the saddle.

206
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,033
-What are you doing?
-I’m tired of riding.

207
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,271
Besides, it cost me nothing.
It come with the horse.

208
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,552
Wind's getting hot.

209
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,189
<i>Sí,</i> what they call in my country
a ''Santa Ana''...

210
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,792
from the clouds of dust...

211
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,555
that follow the cavalry
of the illustrious General Santa Ana.

212
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,356
Let's make for that draw!

213
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,838
Kid, are you all right?

214
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,628
My shoulder. It kind of throbs.

215
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,950
-Could I have a little water, Bob? Please?
-Sure, Kid.

216
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,399
Take it slow.

217
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,353
That's enough.

218
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,830
Where did you picket the horses?

219
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,190
I tied the horses right there to the bushes.

220
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,670
But devils must have come in
the middle of the night and let them loose.

221
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,795
<i>My God!</i>

222
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,678
<i>But what have I done to deserve this?</i>

223
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,318
<i>I was always a good person.</i>

224
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,039
<i>That's what happens to me</i>
<i>after my decision to come here...</i>

225
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,270
<i>to this land, with these two fools.</i>

226
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,638
-Shut up!
<i>-What did I do to end up with these idiots?</i>

227
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,914
Looks like we've got to walk a piece.

228
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,877
Well, what are we waiting for?

229
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,669
-Perley Sweet, what are you doing here?
-Hello, Miss Florie.

230
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,514
You seen three men come through here
begging for water?

231
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,795
If I’d seen anything like pants
around here...

232
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,440
they wouldn't have had to beg
for anything.

233
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,719
Come on, Curly,
get that stock off of there, will you?

234
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,270
-We ain't got all day.
-I’m doing the best I can, Marshal!

235
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,512
-Come on, Curly, move!
-Hurry it up, will you?

236
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,194
Wait a minute!
What are you getting excited about?

237
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,874
I’m not excited. Come on, boys.

238
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,270
Fixing to stay here for a while?

239
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,514
Lordy! If this ain't
a Christmas present for me.

240
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,397
A whole passel of men!

241
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,354
-Come on.
-That's right.

242
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,389
-How's Cousin Carrie Lou doing?
-Right pert, Florie. Come on, Curly!

243
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,160
Well, her loss is my gain.

244
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,954
There ain't been a soul around here
to listen to me...

245
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,635
-since my old cat got tired and left.
-I’ll bet it was a tomcat.

246
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,312
Can I drag it now, Buck?

247
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,392
-I’m 16 hours and 29 minutes late.
-Drag it, Luke.

248
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,199
-Get that on there, boys.
-Drag it, Jake.

249
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,948
There she is, men. Water!

250
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,393
Lots of water.

251
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,673
What is it?

252
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,992
You hear anything?

253
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,793
Cover me, Pete.

254
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,037
There's a fine old state of affairs
at the tanks.

255
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,193
-They ain't dry, are they?
-Worse than that.

256
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,671
It’s a tenderfoot wagon.

257
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,752
A man and his woman.
They come from New Jerusalem.

258
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,313
They made the tanks, all right,
but the water was a little low.

259
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,589
Mr. Tenderfoot ain't got sense enough
to dig out the sand...

260
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,672
sit back and wait
for that sump hole to fill up.

261
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,313
No, sir. Besides, he don't take kindly
to using a shovel.

262
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,477
He puts in a stick of dynamite
to start the water running.

263
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,358
-The fool!
-So he stuck in his dynamite.

264
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,559
Only fool's luck
he didn't blow himself up doing it.

265
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,870
-I wish he did.
-But he didn't.

266
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,878
He just put Terrapin Tanks
out of business forever.

267
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,110
He cracked the granite floor
of that sump hole...

268
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,033
and busted down her sides.
The tanks are dry.

269
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,192
And they'll stay dry.

270
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,268
They can have cloudbursts in this country
from now till I get religion...

271
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,432
them tanks will never hold
another drop of water.

272
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,310
Fool tenderfoot's dead, I guess.

273
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,872
But he's gonna keep right on
killing people, just the same.

274
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,712
Men will come here, banking on water.

275
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,109
Five or six years,
there'll be a dozen skeletons...

276
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,111
around them busted tanks.

277
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,713
But that ain't biting me half as hard
as what he went and done next.

278
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,277
He let his stock nose around and lick up
that alkali slop below the tanks.

279
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,953
It drove 'em plain loco.

280
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,033
They took off up the canyon,
hunting water, with him right after them.

281
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,154
That's four days ago. He ain't back yet.

282
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,313
So we don't need to waste no time
speculating on his case...

283
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,231
or feeling sorry for him.

284
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,235
That wouldn't have been so bad...

285
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,039
but he left his woman alone in that wagon.

286
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,756
Yeah, she's there right now.

287
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,389
She had a little water,
so it wasn't so bad till yesterday.

288
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,352
Then it gives out.

289
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,157
Been pretty hard on her, in there all alone.

290
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,550
She's a nice little woman, too.
28 or 30, I’d guess.

291
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,959
Too blasted good for the cuss she married.

292
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,074
But still, that ain't the worst of it.

293
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,114
No, sir.

294
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,232
Not by a long shot.

295
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,709
She's gonna have a baby,
and she's gonna have it now.

296
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,349
I’m a tough bird, an awful tough old bird...

297
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,110
but I’m not going back in there!

298
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,592
Pete, you gotta go.
You gotta do something for her.

299
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,669
You ought to know something
about these cases. You do, don't you?

300
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,558
Wasn't you married to a woman
down on the Río Bravo?

301
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,756
Didn't she have kids for you?

302
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,713
Sure, Bob. Sure, she did.

303
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,912
But, you know....
An Indian woman is different.

304
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,350
<i>God, our lord...</i>

305
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,957
tells them what to do with babies,
how to born them.

306
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,798
But, a <i>gringa....</i>

307
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,875
<i>Poor girl.</i>

308
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,873
Yeah, my sister, she had all the neighbors,
the doctor, nice white sheets, and--

309
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,110
Pete, I’m not passing the buck.

310
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,790
I’m just ruminating for information.

311
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,549
Pete, please....

312
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,159
Who are you?

313
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,354
<i>Seòora...</i>

314
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,110
please do not be afraid of me.

315
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,111
I have come to help you.

316
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,877
Ain't no use there, Kid.

317
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,073
Only water we're gonna get
is right over here.

318
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,794
Barrelhead.

319
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,272
It ain't the best water,
and it will take time.

320
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,157
But I guess we got plenty of time now.

321
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,549
-Yeah, Pete?
-Bob, I’m going to need the water now.

322
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,312
-Give it to him, Kid.
-How is she?

323
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,516
I don't know. It is her first baby.

324
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,558
Come on,
let's get back to squeezing barrelhead.

325
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,671
She wants to see you...

326
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,915
all of us, together.

327
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,993
Did she have....

328
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,309
A boy.

329
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,033
I can't see you.

330
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,599
-You're the one that found me.
-Yes, ma'am.

331
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,758
-What's your name?
-Robert, ma'am.

332
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,073
Robert Hightower.

333
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,551
William Kearney, ma'am.

334
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,679
I’m proud to make
your acquaintance, ma'am.

335
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,229
And you're Pete. Bless you.

336
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,954
<i>Sí, seòora.</i>

337
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,757
<i>Pedro Encarnación Arango</i>
<i>y Roca Fuerte...</i>

338
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,917
<i>at your service, ma 'am.</i>

339
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,672
Will you save my baby?

340
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,556
Yes, ma'am. I’ll save him.

341
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,553
And I will help.

342
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,713
Me, too, ma'am.

343
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,072
Poor little son.

344
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,990
You'll be all alone in the world
when Mother leaves you...

345
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,517
won't you, sweetheart?

346
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,431
And you'll miss me so.

347
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,908
Nobody to tuck you into bed at night.

348
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,309
Nobody to teach you your prayers.

349
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,034
Nobody to kiss the little sore spots...

350
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,550
when you fall and hurt yourself.

351
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,073
Nobody to tell your little secrets to.

352
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,910
I want you, all of you...

353
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,470
to be my baby's godfathers.

354
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,520
You will be, won't you, Bob Hightower?

355
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,678
You will, Bill Kearney? Pedro? Promise me.

356
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,273
I will, ma'am.

357
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,519
Yes, ma'am.

358
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,630
It will be a big honor, <i>seòora.</i>

359
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,519
And his name.

360
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,313
I call him Robert...

361
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,992
William Pedro...

362
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,634
Hightower.

363
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,719
And when he's a fine, big, brave man...

364
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,997
like his godfathers...

365
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,595
you tell him about his mother...

366
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,711
who so wanted to live...

367
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,674
for him.

368
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,756
Lift him up, please.

369
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,638
Let me kiss my baby.

370
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,992
It’s getting dark.

371
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,071
We must be moving on...

372
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,234
Robert William....

373
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,954
All right, Kid, go ahead.

374
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,078
Is that all, Kid?

375
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,675
Them's all the words I know, Bob.

376
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,275
Then, amen.

377
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,588
Yes, sir.

378
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,999
The more I think of that big fella
in the Texas hat...

379
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,152
the more I admire him.
Hurry up there, Curly!

380
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,798
We're hurrying, Buck.

381
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,997
I get him behind bars
eating some of Ma's cooking...

382
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,954
I’m gonna play him a game of chess.
He'd be right good at it, too, I’ll bet.

383
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,157
Pay attention here, you fellas.
Come on, pay attention.

384
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,639
Stock's ready.

385
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:57,072
Now, it stands to reason
that he'd head south for Mojave Tanks.

386
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,914
We should have reached there before
he did, two horses packing three men.

387
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,278
And I don't take him for any tomfool to go
rushing three men that's got Winchesters.

388
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,670
So I figured that his next move...

389
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,992
would be to push right on through here
to Apache Wells, where we are now.

390
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,434
I hate to admit it, but he's outguessed me.

391
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,556
They might have give out
in that sandstorm--

392
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,993
Not that breed of cat.

393
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,640
They could have made for Dobie,
down this way.

394
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,950
No, that's too far.
So's Dos Hermanas, down here.

395
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,598
They must have gone somewhere, Buck.

396
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,592
Yeah, and mighty cute, too.

397
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,673
He's doubled back on his tracks...

398
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,913
and holed up right here at Terrapin Tanks.
That's where we're going.

399
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,309
We ain't gonna waste no time.
Let's go collect him.

400
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,389
All right, Buck.

401
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,631
You fellas keep your eyes open
for strangers. Remember that reward.

402
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,790
-Okay, Buck.
-All right, Buck.

403
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,639
Tell Cousin Carrie Lou
I’ll be dropping in around New Year's...

404
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,711
maybe with a new husband.

405
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,073
Gosh, Buck, we want to go with you!

406
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,311
You'd be a whole lot safer.

407
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,350
First thing, seems to me, we ought to give
Robert William Pedro a bath.

408
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,509
A bath?

409
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:51,513
I wasn't figuring on that at all.
I was thinking about feeding him.

410
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,915
I’m for tubbing him, all right.

411
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,278
Of course, sooner or later,
we've gotta swab him down.

412
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,715
But he's such a little fellow, Bob.

413
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,349
-He won't use much water.
-He'll fit nice into this dishpan.

414
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,673
I was just wishing he could stagger along
for a few days without bathing.

415
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,069
I don't know much about infants...

416
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:13,518
but little Robert boy here
looks clean enough for me.

417
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,158
Didn't you ask his mother nothing?

418
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,310
Do you think I was gonna
drive the lady crazy...

419
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,436
with a bunch of silly questions?

420
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:24,036
In my opinion, gentlemen, taking a bath
is the least of little Robert's troubles.

421
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,350
He's just naturally gotta eat and
wear something better than this towel.

422
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,396
It'll plumb scratch the hide off of him.

423
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,597
When a mother's gonna have a baby,
she fixes up things for him.

424
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,272
Sews clothes real nice...

425
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,828
and knits pretty little kickshaws
and what all.

426
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,952
Maybe there's something for our godson
in that tail box.

427
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,275
She had a heart, this mother.

428
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,629
<i>She made really nice things for her baby.</i>

429
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:55,315
Don't leave me out here all alone!
How long you gonna be?

430
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,918
They don't expect him to walk
in them things.

431
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,797
And he ain't gonna wear that.

432
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,114
Now, this is something.
This is really something.

433
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,633
Canned milk.

434
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,917
That thick stuff ain't fit to squirt in coffee.

435
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:41,272
She wasn't figuring to feed him coffee,
was she?

436
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,277
This is for Pedrito
when he fixes himself up...

437
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,636
and he touches his guitar
under the balcony of a <i>seòorita.</i>

438
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,670
Bob, this is it.
<i>Dr. Meechum on Caring for the Baby.</i>

439
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,632
See what the doctor allows
about bathing a newborn.

440
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,993
Here is a <i>Biblia.</i>

441
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,513
A Bible book.

442
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,356
''Bathing the baby.

443
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,950
''Too much care cannot be exercised...

444
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:20,592
''in performing this most important part
of the baby's....''

445
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,997
There's a word here
I don't like to say in front of a little baby.

446
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,954
Spell it.

447
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:35,792
T-O-I-L-E-T-T-E.

448
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,839
Toi-letty?

449
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,992
What in the blazes is a toi-letty?

450
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,273
It’s a.... Don't you know?

451
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,196
I guess Robert boy ain't got no toi-letty
in his war bag.

452
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:55,231
No, <i>seòores.</i>
Toi-letta, she is not an evil word.

453
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,517
A toi-letta is a little green tin bathtub...

454
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,549
about the size of my arm.
Costs <i>dos pesos.</i>

455
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,235
When we get to town...

456
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:06,596
we round up the best dad-blamed
green toi-letty money can buy.

457
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:10,514
Remember that, Pete. Crack along, Kid.
What's the doc got to say next?

458
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:14,354
''The first bath
should not be administered...

459
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,469
''until the baby is at least a week old.''

460
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,874
If I had a sick polecat,
I wouldn't send for that Doc Meechum.

461
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,992
A week without a bath.

462
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,389
That's all right for a grown boy...

463
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,472
that ain't supposed to bathe
between water holes...

464
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,597
or in town on Saturday night,
sparking his gal.

465
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,518
But a baby!

466
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,239
I’ll lay my silver spurs the doc's wrong.

467
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,754
Come again, Kid.

468
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,710
''Immediately after birth, the nurse...

469
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,309
''should rub the baby's body with olive oil.

470
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:57,635
''Or if olive oil is not available...

471
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,755
''with some clean, pure lard or grease.''

472
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,874
Grease!

473
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,549
-That?
-Sure, grease. Wait a minute.

474
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,075
Grease.

475
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,198
-Who's gonna grease him?
-You. You are boss wrangler.

476
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,878
It don't sound regular, Bob, I’ll admit,
but it's right here in the book.

477
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,190
I ain't convinced nohow.

478
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:42,435
This godson of ours is starting life
slippery enough without greasing him.

479
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,273
-But you got to follow the book, Bob.
-Sure!

480
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,429
Maybe it will prevent Pedrito from chafing
and from getting saddle blisters.

481
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,869
Me and you have always been....
Wouldn't you like--

482
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,632
No, it's all right.

483
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,672
Cut out the Mex lingo around the kid,
will you, Pete?

484
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,910
First thing you know, he'll be talking it.

485
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,675
We got to raise him
with good old American <i>habla,</i> like his ma.

486
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,071
Hand over the pot.
We'll slick him up a mite.

487
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,793
Easy, easy.

488
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,000
-Pull his legs over a little bit.
-Get your finger out!

489
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,479
All right.

490
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:17,239
Bob, you ain't throwing a half hitch
on a pack mule.

491
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,949
There. That will do it.

492
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,356
That kid's dideed, all right,
and dideed to stay.

493
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,153
Cut out that Mexican.

494
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,110
Ain't you feeling good, Kid?

495
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,471
My shoulder kind of throbs.

496
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,998
We'll spare you
a couple of swigs of water in a little bit.

497
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,351
You'll feel a lot better.

498
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,675
You better see
what the doc is dealing next.

499
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,113
Food. Eat.

500
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,950
No, I got it, Pete. I got it right here.

501
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,352
''Feeding the baby.

502
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,879
''The best and surest method...

503
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:10,751
''is the one which nature has provided.''

504
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,599
Say that again.

505
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,757
''The one which nature has provided.''

506
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:19,277
-Well, that's out.
-Here, this is comforting.

507
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,030
This is downright comforting.

508
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:27,031
The doc allows that
there's times when a newborn infant...

509
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,478
won't thrive on
nothing but condensed milk.

510
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,953
-We got some right here.
-Six cans.

511
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,993
Looks like you're going to
get some chow, Robert boy.

512
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,151
All right, Robert William Pedro,
but you're going to get fed.

513
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:46,358
You better get a can of
that condensed milk and some matches--

514
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,476
-Bob!
-Yeah, Kid.

515
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,835
Let me hold him.

516
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:01,557
Gosh, Kid, you think you ought to,
with that arm and all?

517
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,757
Let me hold my godson.
Just for a little while.

518
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,036
Thanks, Bob, for taking me along and all.

519
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,228
That is pretty, what the Kid is singing.

520
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:23,156
It’s what the folks back home
would call a lullaby.

521
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,828
-Pete, what--
-It’s all right!

522
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,757
<i>Okay, Pedrito. It's time to eat.</i>

523
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,109
<i>Go ahead. Come on, man.</i>

524
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:51,157
<i>Take it. It's good for you. Come on.</i>

525
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:11,194
Boy, he hops to it like a drunkard
at a Fourth of July barbecue.

526
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:34,749
A couple hours, and we'll have to
set them up again for little Robert boy.

527
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,990
I’m for moving on now, Bob. Honest, I’m--

528
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,640
Just lie back
and take it easy while you can.

529
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:43,909
That's the last of the gringo-head cactus.
She is finished.

530
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:49,352
I’ve been figuring. There ain't more than
three shots apiece in these six cans.

531
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,674
That's 18 shots. We've used two already.

532
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:56,070
Leaves 16.
That little Pedro has enough for four days.

533
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:59,675
That's right. The Doc says little William
is to get a slug every six hours.

534
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,069
Which doesn't leave much water
for us godfathers.

535
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:05,277
There's always enough for you, Kid.
Here, have one on the house.

536
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,873
I’ve done a heap of ornery things...

537
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,918
but I ain't stealing the water
that belongs to my godson.

538
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,555
Too bad the doc didn't tell us
where to get water in the Arizona desert.

539
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,949
Wrong book for that. Just a minute.

540
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:21,273
Maybe <i>Nuestro Seòor</i> has put here
what to do in the Bible book.

541
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,114
Don't! It’s bad luck!

542
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,636
I can see it all mapped out: where to find
our next water, where to head.

543
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:30,395
Maybe it says we should head back
for Mojave and that reception committee.

544
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,869
Or over to Apache Wells,
where old Perley is sitting.

545
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,394
Don't be too sure
Buck Sweet is twiddling his thumbs.

546
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,596
I think we ought to
get out of here quick, now!

547
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,591
Where? Where, you jughead?

548
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:44,029
North to Cairo? Northeast to Damascus?
Or east to New Jerusalem?

549
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,278
60 miles or more
with the Kid in the shape he's in?

550
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:50,836
And this punk?
Don't give me any more of your Bible talk.

551
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:55,190
I’d have outfoxed that marshal
if they hadn't saddled this kid on us.

552
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,556
Why didn't somebody stop me
before I promised that woman?

553
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,911
I don't want to grow no long white beard
in the Yuma penitentiary.

554
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,878
May my beard grow clear
till it gets down to my foots...

555
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,951
may it get a nest of prison rats...

556
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,235
before I break my promise
to a dying woman!

557
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,835
-Who said I was breaking my promise?
-Why don't you kill the little fellow?

558
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,718
-Feed him to the coyotes!
-Why, you chili-dipping horse thief!

559
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,631
-Horse thief?
-Yes, horse thief!

560
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,950
Stop talking Spanish in front of the kid!

561
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,235
Now you see what you did?
You make cries the baby!

562
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,675
You waked the baby! Don't blame me!

563
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,268
Sure, nothing!

564
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:43,353
It says right here where we're to go,
just like it's told everything about all this.

565
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,398
You fellas don't understand.
You think this is all just chance?

566
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,789
Just accidental,
like us coming here this way?

567
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,275
Finding the mother, helping her....

568
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,311
The infant in the manger.

569
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,870
The star so bright last night.

570
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:02,752
I ain't talking out of no fever sweat,
Bob, honest I ain't.

571
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:05,308
You think we had anything to do
with what's happened?

572
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,992
No, sir, we didn't.

573
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:10,152
No more than you had anything to do
with throwing the book...

574
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:13,357
so it would open in the place
where I’ve been reading.

575
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,795
Where it tells where we're going to next.

576
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,838
-Listen, I’ll read it.
-No, Kid.

577
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:23,557
Go ahead, Kid,
if it makes you feel any better.

578
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,798
''And when the days...

579
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:29,675
''of her purification were accomplished...

580
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,589
''according to the law of Moses...

581
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:36,150
''they lifted up the child
and brought him to Jerusalem...

582
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,555
''to present him to the Lord.''

583
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:42,108
It says Jerusalem right here in the book.

584
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,714
<i>New Jerusalem.</i>

585
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,154
Look, Bob, maybe <i>Nuestro Seòor...</i>

586
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:50,950
he no care very much
what happens to a simple cattle thief.

587
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:54,635
But if I was in a gambling house,
I would play the Kid's number.

588
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,674
You would?

589
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,309
All right, let's get cracking along.

590
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:43,432
Kid, me and Pete will spell each other
carrying the infant.

591
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:47,115
I’m toting my godson my share of the way.
That's part of it.

592
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:49,517
That's in the book, too.

593
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,273
There was three wise men
come from the East, wasn't there?

594
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,954
Three wise men. I’m one of them.

595
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,231
I’m betting on you, Kid.

596
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,715
All right, Pete, which way's Jerusalem?

597
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,592
Why, that way, Bob.

598
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,031
Can't you see the star?

599
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,396
Look, water.

600
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:51,351
-That ain't water, Kid.
-Salt.

601
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:55,390
It’s a salt lake. We got to cross it.

602
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,358
-No.
-Just a little bit, Kid.

603
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:14,116
Don't be a fool, Kid. Drink it.

604
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,991
-You got to.
-No!

605
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,838
He shouldn't have
made me swallow that, Bob.

606
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:53,999
-That's all right.
-You shouldn't have done it, Pete.

607
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,833
Once we're across the flats,
we're through the worst of it.

608
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,113
Here.

609
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,515
-What are you doing?
-It will be easier crossing the sand.

610
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,235
There's plenty of rough country
over there, Kid.

611
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,034
I ain't figuring on going that far.

612
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,318
No, sir.

613
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,519
I ain't figuring on that at all.

614
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:06,748
Take your horses down to the tanks, boys.
Fill up your kegs first.

615
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:10,271
-Sure need it, Marshal.
-They'll drink her dry, Buck.

616
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:14,280
Curly, take a look in that wagon.

617
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,440
Gosh, Buck, there's been a woman here.

618
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,114
Left her dresses all this and that way.

619
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,633
What are they like?

620
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:29,429
One's real nice, sort of faded,
but soft, like silk.

621
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,909
-Is it red?
-Yeah, it's red with a....

622
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:35,318
Has the top got all little white ribbons
all around the rim?

623
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,879
It sure has, Buck.

624
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,471
That was her wedding dress.

625
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,199
Fourth of July.

626
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:48,509
Red and white, carrying a little blue fan.

627
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,919
Come on, Curly.

628
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:22,154
Those fellas have done watered up...

629
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:25,238
and then dynamited our tanks, left us dry.

630
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:30,558
Lot of boys stick up stagecoaches,
and banks, and one thing or another.

631
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,470
But a man that would dynamite
a water hole in this kind of country...

632
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,437
is downright criminal.

633
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,156
-How about giving the stock--
-Can't.

634
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,356
-Can't we just wet our whistle?
-Can't.

635
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:46,229
You heard Mr. Latham when he said $100,
dead or alive.

636
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,190
I’ll add $50 to it. I’d like 'em dead.

637
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,439
It’s time. Water.

638
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:32,034
If I whimper for water, Pete...

639
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,876
don't give it to me. Promise.

640
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,428
-Promise.
-It’s a promise, Kid.

641
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:47,071
137th psalm.

642
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,834
One-three-seven. Read, please.

643
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,275
''By the rivers of Babylon...

644
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,597
''there we sat down...

645
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,318
''yea, and we wept...

646
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,470
''when we remembered Zion.''

647
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:12,910
''We hanged our harps upon the willows.''

648
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:17,317
''If I forget thee, O Jerusalem...

649
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:21,750
''let my right hand forget her cunning.

01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,398
''How shall we sing the Lord's song...

01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,112
''in a strange land?''

652
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:35,516
''Our Father, who art in heaven....''

653
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,399
''Our Father....''

654
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,916
''Now I lay me down to sleep.

655

01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,917

01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,433
''pray the Lord...

''my soul to take.''

660
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:06,031
God bless Mom and Pop...

661
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:09,036
and sister.

662
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:13,035
Make me a good boy.

663
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,388
Amen.

664
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,789
When do we set up the drinks again...

665
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,199
for Robert William?

666
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:05,469
I think about 50 minutes.

667
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:12,479
They're slipping it easy
to the Kid up there.

668
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:14,239
<i>Poor boy.</i>

669
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:18,756
Made him a little boy again.

670
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:50,873
It’s broke.

671
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:52,469
Your leg?

672
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:56,075
-She's busted. I’m ashamed.
-Maybe I can fix it.

673
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:59,675
-Waste time.
-I can make a travois Comanche-style...

674
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,478
-and drag you.
-Waste time.

675
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:04,518
On the other side of the mountain,
New Jerusalem.

676
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:05,999
You will make it.

677
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,389
When does little Pedro eat next?

678
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:12,714
Not for more than two hours.

679
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:22,478
<i>Adiós.</i>

680
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:30,030
Guess I better get moving along.

681
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:40,193
Maybe you better leave me your pistol.

682
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,517
The coyotes, you know?

683
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,672
Yeah, sure, Pete.

684
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,038
Coyotes.

685
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:02,796
I’m sorry I called you
a chili-dipping horse thief back there.

686
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,110
It’s all right.

687
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:14,917
I just remembered what tomorrow is.

688
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:19,593
Merry Christmas.

689
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,311
Merry Christmas, Pete.

690
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:40,793
<i>Our Father...</i>

691
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,472
<i>who art in heaven...</i>

692
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,113
<i>make some space...</i>

693
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:49,473
<i>in your Holy Land...</i>

694
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:52,272
<i>for this poor Pedro.</i>

695
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:35,231
Mount up. Let's get going.

696
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:38,471
''...unto Jerusalem....''

697
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:47,636
''...a donkey tied, and a colt with her:

698
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:52,871
''loose them, and bring them unto me.''

699
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:03,996
A donkey and his colt.

700
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:07,476
You just try stealing a man's burro
in this country!

701
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:10,119
They'd string you.

702
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:40,031
That's it, Kid.

703
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:41,954
Sing it.

704
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:44,718
Sing a lullaby.

705
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:54,635
This is where she ends, godson.

706
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:58,793
This is the end of the trail, little Robert.

707
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,838
<i>So, you break your promise</i>
<i>to a dying woman?</i>

708
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,037
I can't go any further.

709
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:10,429
<i>Of course you can, Bob.</i>
<i>What does the book say?</i>

710
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:13,273
<i>-Follow the book.</i>
<i>-Get up on your knees, you sack of dung!</i>

711
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:17,035
You can't....
You got no right to call me that.

712
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,111
I’m going.

713
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:24,279
But you quit talking Mex
in front of the infant.

714
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:26,672
You quit it, you hear?

715
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:43,794
<i>-You're doing fine, Bob. Just fine.</i>
-Sure I am.

716
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:47,635
<i>Just think of the cantina</i>
<i>in New Jerusalem.</i>

717
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:50,109
Yeah, I’m thinking of it.

718
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,039
<i>A glass of beer.</i>

719
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:56,193
<i>-A big cool, cool glass of beer.</i>
-Yeah.

720
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,953
<i>Five glasses of cool beer.</i>

721
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:03,478
<i>You'll make it.</i>

722
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,432
Sure I will.

723
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:26,434
Merry Christmas, everybody.
Merry Christmas to all.

724
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:30,352
Set 'em up, bartender.

725
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:32,917
Milk for the infant...

726
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:35,800
and a cool, cool beer for me.

727
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:41,474
A baby!

728
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,472
Turn around, Texas.

729
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,238
Turn around and draw.

730
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:40,399
Perley, you old hay shaker.

731
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,119
You got me.

732
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:04,275
Looks like the baby's pappy...

733
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:07,674
is a mighty sick man.

734
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:27,955
Texas, you're about half-smart.
Jury still out, Curly?

735
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:30,918
Yep, still out.
The boss says, ''Come and get it.''

736
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:34,072
I’ll thank you to remember
there's only one boss around here.

737
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:36,993
Yes, sir, and she says, ''Chow's down.''

738
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,795
-Morning, Carrie Lou.
-Morning, Bob. Sit right here.

739
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:42,949
Thank you.

740
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:46,555
Folks at the courthouse said you looked
mighty handsome in those new jeans.

741
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:47,709
Thanks, Carrie Lou.

742
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:50,837
And especially in those boots
with the Lone Star stitched on them.

743
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:52,956
Yeah, they're real comfortable.

744
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:55,430
Hope the batter on this chicken
is to your liking.

745
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:58,671
-Looks good.
-A little syrup for them corn oysters?

746
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:00,796
Corn oysters? I didn't get no corn oysters.

747
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,189
I only had but two ears of sweet corn.

748
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:06,750
All right, seeing what he did
for little Buck.

749
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:08,639
Little Robert.

750
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:12,116
I told you he wouldn't stand for
a name like that for a little Perley.

751
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:15,078
His name
is Robert William Pedro Hightower.

752
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:17,628
Yes, of course it is,
until the court changes it.

753
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:18,675
Ma !

754
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:22,793
Bob, have some coffee, will you?
You ain't eaten much lately.

755
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:25,110
-You off your feed or something?
-I’m worrying.

756
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:26,713
Don't worry about it.

757
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:29,075
Maybe the judge won't give you
the full 20 years.

758
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:32,357
It ain't that.
I could do 20 years standing on my head.

759
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:36,194
I’m worrying since I hefted little Robert
this morning. He's losing weight.

760
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:39,158
It’s only natural for new babies
to lose a little weight, Bob.

761
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:41,913
He didn't lose any when I was nursing him.

762
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:49,150
No. We're giving that little dear
just every care we can.

763
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:51,800
If he were our very own
we couldn't love him more.

764
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:53,950
Ma, don't carry on, now.

765
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:56,950
One thing you can count on,
Bob Hightower...

766
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:59,878
you couldn't find better hands
to leave the little mite in...

767
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:01,029
than Perley's and mine.

768
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:03,190
-That's right, Bob.
-Sure.

769
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:06,433
Maybe. You two being
his uncle and aunt...

770
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,829
sort of distant relations, you might say.

771
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:12,629
See, Ma, I knew he would.
I knew I had you pegged right.

772
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:15,439
Look, you just sign this paper
right there on the ''X,'' see?

773
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,909
Wait up, now. Wait up. What is all this?

774
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,991
The adoption papers, of course.

775
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:22,310
I ain't anxious
to turn my godson to pasture.

776
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:25,039
You just said right there
that we were distant relations.

777
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:26,075
I never.

778
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:29,072
-The jury's coming in, Buck.
-How they look?

779
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,559
They look like a passel of pallbearers.

780
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:41,273
Your Honor, we find the prisoner guilty
according to law...

781
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:45,310
but under exterminating circumstances.

782
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:55,476
Before passing sentence upon you,
Robert Marmaduke Hightower--

783
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:07,508
Now, have you anything you wish to say?

784
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:12,198
No, sir. I guess I ain't.

785
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,029
You ain't?

786
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:16,793
It seems, in this case...

787
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:20,156
we have a mighty fine set
of extenuating circumstances...

788
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:24,991
notably dealing with an infant child
you claim to be your godson.

789
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:26,553
He is my godson.

790
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:31,398
And now we come to the question
of the infant's custodianship.

791
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,479
Who gets him, etc.

792
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:35,710
-Your Honor, if the court pleases--
-Yes, I know.

793
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:37,836
I got your application right here.

794
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:41,637
Prisoner, have you any objection
to the Marshal and Mrs. Sweet...

795
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:43,312
taking this here child?

796
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:47,234
If you mean permanent,
I got plenty of objections...

797
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:50,639
but if it's temporary, that's different...

798
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:55,392
providing, of course, they guarantee
to give him a good education and such.

799
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:59,396
And just what specific do you mean
as ''and such,'' etc.?

800
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:03,353
Teach him good horse sense, respect...

801
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:06,030
say, ''Yes, sir'' when he's spoke to, and....

802
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:09,436
That seems reasonable.
Do you agree, Buck?

803
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:11,672
Sure, Wiley.

804
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,231
But what Ma and me wanted
was to have little Buck permanent.

805
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:18,353
Sure you would,
but you ain't going to get...

806
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:22,035
little Robert William Pedro
permanent, Perley.

807
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:26,759
Now, that's as it may be,
etc. and so forth....

808
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:30,389
Robert Marmaduke Hightower...

809
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:32,950
it is within the power of this here court...

810
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:36,829
to sentence you to a term of 20 years
in the penitentiary.

811
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:38,988
However, this here court...

812
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:42,231
may be willing
to suspend that sentence indefinite...

813
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:45,109
providing you sign this here paper...

814
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:48,033
yielding your godson
to the Marshal and Mrs. Sweet...

815
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:51,749
and furthermore providing
that you never again set foot...

816
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:54,877
in the township of Welcome,
territory of Arizona.

817
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:59,229
You can throw the book at me, Judge.
I ain't gonna do her.

818
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:02,029
I ain't breaking my promise
to a dying woman.

819
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:06,357
That's just what I been waiting for
to hear you say, son.

820
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:10,831
I hereby give you the minimum sentence
under the law:

821
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:12,911
one year and one day.

822
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:16,835
Court's closed, bar's open.
Double bourbon, bartender, if you please.

823
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:03,637
<i>Bye, friend.</i>

824
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:05,711
I’ll be awfully good to little....

825
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,829
Robert William Pedro.

826
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:14,517
-Goodbye, Bob.
-I know you will, Carrie Lou.

827
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:18,354
Goodbye and good luck, boy.
A year in jail will do you real good.

828
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:19,839
Thank you, ma'am.

829
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:22,753
Bye, Bob. Good luck.

830
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:31,836
-Goodbye, Perley, you old hay shaker.
-Goodbye, Bob.

831
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:35,393
Say, kind of look after my deputy,
will you?

832
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:37,630
See he gets started home
from Yuma all right.

833
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:40,234
You know, he's never been away
from Welcome before.

834
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,436
Sure, I’ll take care of him.

835
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:44,432
Put him on the train myself.

836
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:46,192
-Mr. Hightower.
-Miss Latham.

837
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:48,510
I want to thank you
for that Lady Baltimore cake.

838
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:51,717
-I’m mighty glad you liked it.
-It would have been a lot lighter...

839
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:54,234
without that hacksaw you baked in it.

840
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:57,876
Proud to haul you, son.

841
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:01,112
Can I write to you, Mr. Hightower?
Can I call you Bob?

842
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:04,751
I’d be proud for you
to take your pen in hand, Miss Latham.
