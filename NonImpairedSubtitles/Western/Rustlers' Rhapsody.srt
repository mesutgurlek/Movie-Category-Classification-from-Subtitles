3
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,970
This is how evey Rex O'Herlihan
movie ever made always start_.

4
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:53,268
lt was the same evey time.

5
00:00:53,466 --> 00:00:56,035
And they made
52 of them in all

6
00:00:56,233 --> 00:01:00,904
bemeen the years
1938 and 1947.

7
00:01:11,766 --> 00:01:13,734
Sounds like trouble.

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,335
On, Wildfire, on!

9
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:13,904
1947 was the year the lights
sort ofwent out for Rex.

10
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,268
Yeah, he never did
much aner that.

11
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:21,270
Always made me wonder what one
ofthese B Westerns would look like.

12
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:24,468
You know, if they still
made them today.

14
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:51,335
On, Wildfire, on!

15
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:54,700
ln the first place,

16
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,336
the bad guys probably
wouldn't all be such cowards.

17
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:05,936
Rex probably wouldn't
be so damn pemect all the time.

19
00:05:27,266 --> 00:05:29,635
Root's beginning to work.

20
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:39,804
The prairie sun has
Kissed the day g_bye

21
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:43,202
Yeah, it's definitely kicking in now.

22
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:49,339
The wind behind me
Sounds like it may cy

23
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,067
Here we go.

24
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:59,674
Now l hear the lonesome
Whistle of a quail

25
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:03,835
As l ride alone

26
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:07,802
Along the tumbleweed trail

27
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:16,639
The road ahead is as endless
As the one l le_ behind

28
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:23,303
But there are no ties
To hold me down

29
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,904
Because l was born
The drining kind

30
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:32,737
With just a faithful horse
for company

31
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:36,736
And a saddle for my home

32
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:44,402
l ride alone

33
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:51,634
l ride alone

34
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:58,368
- Morning, ma'am.
- Morning.

35
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:22,467
Glass of warm milk, please.

36
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:29,800
Make it a sarsaparilla.

37
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:36,768
ls this one of those
really tough bars?

38
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:44,371
Well, let me have a large glass of warm
gin served with a human hair in it.

39
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:46,801
Coming up.

40
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,335
This here stoy
is about the time

41
00:07:58,533 --> 00:08:01,903
the most wonde_ul and interesting
thing happened to Rex.

42
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,334
He met me.

43
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:06,001
Let me guess.

44
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:09,303
You're new here at Oa_ood
Estates, aren't you, mister?

45
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,102
You buy me a drink,
l'll tell you what's going on.

46
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,735
Bartender, make that two.

47
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:19,934
OK, OK.
Here's what's happening.

48
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:23,135
Most of these people are nobodies.
Forget about them.

49
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,702
That group,
those are the sheepherders.

50
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:29,336
They're the good guys.
Work hard, don't bother nobody.

51
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,568
But they smell God-amul.

52
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:33,400
Must be the sheep.

53
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,970
Makes you wanna kill them
sometimes. Oh, yeah.

54
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:50,869
Now, over here is the sheriff.

55
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:54,903
Obviously a corrupt coward
who takes his orders from the colonel.

56
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,035
- The colonel?
- Yeah, the colonel.

57
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:59,768
The power-mad cattle baron
who really runs the town.

58
00:08:59,966 --> 00:09:01,200
Oh, yeah.

59
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:06,002
Can l have another drink?
l'm the town drunk, you know.

60
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:10,302
- Sure.
- Warm gin!

61
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,767
Hold the hair.

62
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,434
Who's that, over there?

63
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:24,001
That's Miss Tracy.

64
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,336
She solicits drinks,
hooks on the side.

65
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:32,971
But you know, she doesn't actually
go to bed with her customers.

66
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,735
She iust talks dirty to them.

67
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,336
And underneath that e_erior
is a heart of gold.

68
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:41,067
Yeah.

69
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:43,501
How did you know that?

70
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,601
l know.

71
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:51,170
Of course, l don't have
to pay for sex myself.

72
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:01,137
You'll excuse me, won't you?
Hi, wanna know what's going on?

73
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,335
l smell sheep.

74
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:31,269
Bad guys, work for the colonel.

75
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:36,871
Now, there wouldn't happen to be any
sheepherders in here, would there?

76
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:45,167
l'm not wearing a gun.

77
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:51,937
And l'm not going to do anything
that might in any way cause you...

78
00:10:58,266 --> 00:11:00,101
lt's a tough town.

79
00:11:04,866 --> 00:11:07,301
Sory about the table,
saloon owner.

80
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:11,169
That's OK, Blackie.
No problem.

81
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:13,468
Since it's Tuesday,
have a free drink.

82
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,801
- It's on the house.
- Blackie.

83
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,935
You can kill me too,
if you want.

84
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:20,535
But l think it's exactly
this type of thing

85
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:24,503
that drives down property values
here in Oa_ood Estates...

86
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:30,068
That was the town doctor.

87
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:32,968
l'm kidding.
Just some real-estate guy.

88
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:36,301
Sory about that, sheriff.

89
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,303
Well, you certainly don't
have to apologize to me.

90
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,902
These fellows were
driving you crazy.

91
00:11:43,566 --> 00:11:47,269
l swear, sometimes
l don't know how you put up with it.

92
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,669
Anybody else got
anything to say?

93
00:11:50,866 --> 00:11:52,434
l do.

94
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:55,102
l think you're out of order, Blackie.

95
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:58,102
What do you know?
You're just a prostitute!

96
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:01,836
Who sells her body to anyone
with the financial wherewithal...

97
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:03,534
All right!

98
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:06,135
That'll be enough
of that kind of talk.

99
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:13,702
What in the hell are you?

100
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:18,670
Just a stranger passing through.

101
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,803
Where in the hell
did you get that shirt?

102
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,170
How a person dresses is nobody's
business but his or her own.

103
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:35,201
- What?
- You heard me.

104
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:37,801
You know what
you look like to me?

105
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,237
You look like one of those fellas
who's attracted to other men.

106
00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:44,434
This is iust a warning.

107
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,202
lf you or your men draw on me,

108
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,668
l'll shoot each man in the hand.

109
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,968
ln the hand?

110
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:55,600
That's right.

111
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:58,068
Not in the face or the chest?

112
00:12:58,266 --> 00:12:59,500
Nope.

114
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,002
l don't like the idea
of getting shot in the hand.

115
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,268
Then go home, Blackie.

116
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:07,534
- Go home?
- That's right.

117
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:09,767
Go home?

118
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:12,668
Yeah, and see someone
about your hearing.

119
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,001
Draw your gun, prairie faiy.

120
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,367
l never draw first.

121
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:25,169
Well, hell. That's no problem.

122
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:30,602
Well, don't iust stand there, boys.
Get him.

123
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:33,134
Now!

124
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,101
Now we've done it.

125
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,200
All right, you two.

126
00:13:55,566 --> 00:13:57,668
Get your friend
and get out of here.

127
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,101
But he's dead.

128
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:01,767
So what?

129
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,534
Get him out of here.

130
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,368
You ain't heard
the last of this, mister.

131
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:15,067
l know.

132
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:17,067
Believe me, l know.

133
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:29,638
Mister, l never saw shooting
like that in my life.

134
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,268
You're good.

135
00:14:32,766 --> 00:14:34,534
Thanks, partner.

136
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,569
Was that as good for you
as it was for me?

137
00:14:45,366 --> 00:14:46,834
Yeah.

138
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,535
Excuse me.
Excuse me there, stranger.

139
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:00,334
You got a place to stay?

140
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,601
l got a campsite
outside of town.

141
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,269
Why don't you stay
in the hotel?

142
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:07,668
l never stay in town.

143
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:10,134
What's your name anyhow?

144
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:12,935
l'm Rex O'Herlihan,
The Singing Cowboy.

145
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:15,802
- The what?
- The Singing Cowboy!

146
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,503
Oh, well, listen, Mr. O'Herlihan.
You got to be careful

147
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,303
here in Oa_ood Estates.
This is a plenty dangerous town.

148
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,204
High-stakes power plays, murder,
robbey, intrigue, the works.

149
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,802
You think that's funny?
This is the West.

150
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,671
People are arbitrarily shot to pieces
Ieft and right. l mean, it is all so violent!

151
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,701
Where was l?

152
00:15:47,866 --> 00:15:50,068
Oh. ''lt's all so violent.''

153
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:51,500
Oh, yeah.

154
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,301
Yeah, see, this is the West.

155
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,269
- Out in the West...
- l know all about the West.

156
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:59,168
l travel all over it, from town to town.
That's what l do.

157
00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:01,067
Yeah, but see, in this town...

158
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:04,002
This town's no different
than any Western town.

159
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,434
They're all identical.

160
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:06,934
They are?

161
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,368
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

162
00:16:10,566 --> 00:16:13,602
ln evey town there's a bar
like the one we came from.

163
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:16,435
They might not all have
continuous entertainment,

164
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:18,234
but they're basically the same.

165
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:22,670
Sheriffs stereotypical, and so is the
saloon owner with that mustache...

166
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:25,001
Oh, no, no. Those guys are unique.

167
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,535
l'm sory, but l iust
don't believe you.

168
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:33,271
OK, you have a vey pretty, but
somehow asexual, new schoolmarm?

169
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:35,100
Yeah.

170
00:16:35,766 --> 00:16:38,401
ls the blacksmith a friendly guy
who only gets mad

171
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,535
when somebody
burns down his barn?

172
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:41,967
Yeah.

173
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:46,970
ls the editor of the paper an idealist
who hocked eveything for his press?

174
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,534
Damn.

175
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:50,667
See.

176
00:16:51,766 --> 00:16:55,302
Hey, hey, l know one thing that's...

177
00:16:59,566 --> 00:17:02,335
l know one thing
different about Oa_ood Estates.

178
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:06,436
- None of these other towns have...
- Railroad coming through.

179
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:08,500
Holy cow!

180
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:12,602
All Western towns have
the railroad coming through?

181
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,034
Yep.

182
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,435
Wait! Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

183
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:22,604
One last thing. Do all these
towns have a town drunk?

184
00:17:24,933 --> 00:17:26,434
l'm not sure.

185
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,102
Oh, come on.

186
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:32,967
You know.

187
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,167
No, you're the first l ever met.

188
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,635
Oh, well, that's something
at least, isn't it?

189
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,402
Sure is, partner.
You're one of a kind.

190
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:55,303
You ought to...
You ought to travel more.

191
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,134
Get out, see the world.

192
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,201
You know,
the most amazing thing

193
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,036
is that all these other towns
are as violent as this one.

194
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:04,467
Yep.

195
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,667
Hard to believe.

196
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:08,867
Yep. _diós, buckaroo.

197
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:11,001
On, Wildfire, on!

198
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:15,635
for some reason, the bad guy
was always a colonel

199
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,768
who had a beautiful,
young daughter

200
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:22,070
and about 1,OOO head ofcattle
which you'd hear but never see.

201
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,468
Let me iust ask you one question.

202
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,602
There's one thing
l'm most curious about.

203
00:18:37,266 --> 00:18:39,901
Why bring the body here?

204
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:43,002
My God, this is a home.
People live here!

205
00:18:43,866 --> 00:18:46,802
Well, colonel, we didn't
know what to do with him.

206
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,837
Buy him. How about that?
Don't you think that's a good idea?

207
00:18:51,033 --> 00:18:53,034
Oh, yeah. Yes, sir, colonel.

208
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:55,134
Do you think,
when somebody dies,

209
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,202
they place them permanently
on the family couch?

210
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:02,469
- No, sir.
- Gee whiz!

211
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:09,570
Well, l'm sory.
l'm a little upset, that's all.

212
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,436
And the couch is new,
and Blackie was my best man.

213
00:19:13,633 --> 00:19:15,868
Poor Blackie.

214
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,269
Always acting so mean.

215
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:21,367
Always shooting people.

216
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,202
Well, l saw something
a little deeper than that.

217
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:33,468
l saw a man who could feel.

218
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,468
Who could touch.

219
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,768
l think we should go.

220
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,801
You say this stranger
shot Blackie in the back?

221
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,738
Yes. He got eveybody in the bar to say
that we done it. Can you believe that?

222
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,101
Then he's a coward and a liar!

223
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,001
You better take care of him.

224
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:55,300
How do you mean?

225
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,634
Shoot him!

226
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:01,803
End his life, that's what l mean
when l say take care of somebody.

227
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,470
l want you to cut him open,
reach in with your bare hands...

228
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,035
Hi, Daddy, am l interrupting?

229
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:09,734
No.

230
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:13,236
l was iust telling the boys
here how to buy Blackie.

231
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:17,403
Daddy, can l have Wildfire
for my vey, vey own?

232
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:20,002
Please, Daddy.
l'll be careful, l promise.

233
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,369
Wildfire is a lot of horse,
little lady.

234
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:25,200
Oh, Daddy, please!

235
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,769
lf anybody can ride him, l can.

236
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,368
Please, please,
please, please, please.

237
00:20:30,566 --> 00:20:33,135
Well, l guess you're right.
He's yours.

238
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,201
Oh, thank you, Daddy!

239
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,502
Oh, thank you, thank you.

240
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,534
Buy Blackie?

241
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:42,969
Yeah, he's on the couch there, dead.

242
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:47,435
No!

243
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:57,635
You and Blackie dated?

244
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,067
Dated?

245
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:03,269
Oh, Daddy, we did eveything
together. Eveything.

246
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:05,634
Oh, my God.

247
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,035
l knew the real Blackie.

248
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:13,003
Oh, Daddy, he could feel.
He could touch.

249
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,803
Oh, my God!

250
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:18,667
Take care of her, men.

251
00:21:20,266 --> 00:21:24,036
No, not that! Take her
upstairs is what l meant.

253
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,768
Gee whiz!

254
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,469
My dearest mother.

255
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,802
Quiet. Quiet.

256
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:45,970
Send $1 ,OOO

257
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:49,035
for supplies

258
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,301
and travel.

259
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:57,605
Thanking you in advance.

260
00:22:57,799 --> 00:22:59,568
- l am...
- Let's shoot him now.

261
00:22:59,766 --> 00:23:02,802
No. Let's be on the safe side,
wait till he's asleep.

262
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,835
The Singing Cowboy.

263
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:28,667
He's gone.

264
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:32,469
He's not gone, you idiot.
He's somewhere out there in the dark.

265
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,634
He got the drop on us.

266
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:42,767
Howdy, stranger.

267
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,601
Howdy.

268
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:49,470
We're looking for someone
named...Betty.

269
00:23:51,133 --> 00:23:52,801
There's no Betty here.

270
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,468
No Betty here?

271
00:23:55,366 --> 00:23:56,867
Did you hear that, fellas?

272
00:23:57,066 --> 00:23:59,234
l reckon we came
to the wrong campsite.

273
00:23:59,433 --> 00:24:01,034
l reckon you did.

274
00:24:20,466 --> 00:24:22,868
You fellas are making
a big mistake.

275
00:24:24,466 --> 00:24:25,700
How's that?

276
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,302
The way you positioned
yourselves.

277
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,171
When the shooting starts, you're likely
to miss me and hit each other.

278
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:59,969
You think you're real smart,
don't you, fella?

279
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,536
When l see something that's
obviously wrong, l usually speak up.

280
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:07,868
Well, l hope you're good
in arithmetic too

281
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:11,502
because there's only one
of you and there's...five of us.

282
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,669
- Oh, that doesn't matter.
- How do you mean?

283
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,135
Just to be semi-fair,

284
00:25:18,866 --> 00:25:20,767
l'll only use one gun.

285
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,503
Oh, we've got a real smart aleck
on our hands, haven't we, boys?

286
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,468
All you have to do is draw.

287
00:25:30,133 --> 00:25:31,868
What if we don't wanna draw?

288
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:34,034
Now, that would be fine with me.

289
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:36,001
Actually, l'd prefer it.

290
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,870
But we do wanna draw.
Don't we, men?

291
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:44,768
Anytime, boys.

292
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:10,169
You're the only one
l can turn to now, Wildfire.

293
00:26:11,233 --> 00:26:13,001
You're like me.

294
00:26:13,566 --> 00:26:17,236
You're wild and free
and headstrong,

295
00:26:18,266 --> 00:26:20,968
but you love me.

296
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:26,638
That's why l'm the only, only person
in the whole world who can ride you.

297
00:26:28,366 --> 00:26:31,235
- l'm tired of getting shot in the hand.
- Shut up.

298
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:36,204
- What are we gonna tell the colonel?
- Tell him we need help to kill this guy.

299
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:47,435
Who is it?

300
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:53,401
A bunch of your men.

301
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:55,068
Five of them.

302
00:26:55,266 --> 00:26:57,234
l'll be right there, men.

303
00:27:00,466 --> 00:27:02,067
Did you kill him?

304
00:27:03,533 --> 00:27:05,268
No, not exactly.

305
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:06,800
Not exactly?

306
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,270
Well, we tried to kill him, colonel,
but he shot us in the hands.

307
00:27:11,466 --> 00:27:14,569
- In the hands?
- Yeah, it hurts too.

308
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:19,103
l think we ought to talk to the railroad
men about helping us kill this guy.

309
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:21,769
l don't like going
to the railroad for help.

310
00:27:21,966 --> 00:27:24,368
This guy's faster
on the draw than Blackie was.

311
00:27:24,566 --> 00:27:26,668
Yeah, colonel,
and he never misses.

312
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:30,367
J
Well

313
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:34,535
maybe we should
go to the railroad people.

314
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:40,736
Why don't you all come in,
make yourselves comfortable.

315
00:27:40,933 --> 00:27:43,735
- We'll gab about it.
- Well, we can't, colonel.

316
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:48,203
We have to, you know, go to town,
see the doctor about our hands.

317
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,269
- And it's a weeknight.
- Yeah.

318
00:27:51,466 --> 00:27:53,367
Oh, all right, good night!

319
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:57,702
Oh, by the way,
have any of you seen my daughter?

320
00:27:58,433 --> 00:28:00,034
- No.
- No. No, sir, colonel.

321
00:28:02,033 --> 00:28:04,468
She's probably
out riding Wildfire.

322
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,736
There's one little lady
who can take care of herself.

323
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,602
Help! Help!

324
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:14,734
Help!

325
00:28:31,233 --> 00:28:34,703
ln the '60s, they started making
these spaghetti Westerns.

326
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,768
l was always jealous
of these guys

327
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:39,935
because they had better
background music than we did.

328
00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:42,802
They all got to wear
those great raincoats,

329
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,502
even when it was 110
in the shade.

330
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,170
Trouble was, you could hardly
understand anything they said.

332
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,868
Colonel, don't you think

333
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:54,868
you and me ought
to work together?

334
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:58,502
l mean, l know
our men dress differently,

335
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,402
but look what we have
in common.

336
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:04,135
We're both rich.

337
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:07,002
We're both power-mad.

338
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,103
And we're both colonels. Now,
that's got to count for something.

339
00:29:12,966 --> 00:29:14,834
Tell me...

340
00:29:15,433 --> 00:29:18,936
Tell me about this stranger
who shoots men in the hand.

341
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:24,771
Could his presence here
result in an all-out range war?

342
00:29:24,966 --> 00:29:29,970
Well, maybe not a range war exactly,

343
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:32,701
but certainly a lot of killing.

344
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,702
You have my word on that,
a lot of it!

345
00:29:36,866 --> 00:29:38,167
All right.

346
00:29:38,366 --> 00:29:39,600
Count us in.

347
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:41,668
Oh, good, good, good.

348
00:29:42,233 --> 00:29:45,069
Now, the first thing
we have to do

349
00:29:45,266 --> 00:29:47,935
is keep the element
of surprise.

350
00:29:48,133 --> 00:29:51,035
This fancy-shooting fella
has got to be kept

351
00:29:51,233 --> 00:29:54,336
completely in the dark
about what we're doing.

352
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:03,300
Hey, look!

353
00:30:05,866 --> 00:30:07,500
What the...?

354
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:11,001
Somebody pull
the emergency brake!

355
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,268
- Quick!
- No! Don't!

356
00:30:22,733 --> 00:30:24,000
Get the horses!

357
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,302
We can't.
We left them at the station.

358
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,268
Oh, you idiots!

359
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,769
What were we supposed
to do, buy them tickets?

360
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:54,602
Have you got three rifles
with telescopic sights?

361
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,501
Yes.

362
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:19,801
You missed!
How could you miss?

363
00:31:21,066 --> 00:31:24,636
Even with these sights, we got
a target 100 yards away or more.

364
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:27,001
We've never fired
these weapons before!

365
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,970
There's a definite wind factor,
and we've got a problem with the sun!

366
00:31:31,966 --> 00:31:33,600
Just shoot, OK?

367
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:46,269
Well, hell, we're gonna
be here all day.

368
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:15,703
This isn't going
to be easy, is it?

369
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:20,634
On, Wildfire, on!

370
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:25,668
Have you got a light?

371
00:32:25,866 --> 00:32:27,467
Yeah, l got a light.

372
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:30,168
Your butt and my face.

373
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:36,667
Now, wait a minute.

374
00:32:36,866 --> 00:32:38,934
l got a match.

375
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:41,768
Yeah, and it's...
It's not your butt.

376
00:32:41,966 --> 00:32:45,669
lt's... It's my butt!

377
00:32:45,866 --> 00:32:47,300
Yeah, my butt and...

378
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,567
My butt and...

379
00:32:50,766 --> 00:32:53,034
Hi, stranger,
wanna know what's going on?

380
00:32:53,233 --> 00:32:55,268
l'm the town doctor, you fool.

381
00:32:55,466 --> 00:32:59,436
- Oh, yeah. Hi, doc. How's it going?
- Bartender, shot of bourbon.

382
00:32:59,633 --> 00:33:03,069
l didn't recognize you.
You look like you seen a ghost.

383
00:33:03,266 --> 00:33:05,334
l've seen worse than that.

384
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:08,769
- Where's the hair?
- It's in there.

385
00:33:14,733 --> 00:33:18,670
Last night, five men came to me,
all complaining of hand injuries.

386
00:33:18,866 --> 00:33:20,634
Almost identical.

387
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,668
Not more than 20 minutes ago,

388
00:33:22,866 --> 00:33:25,435
three more men came in
with the same wound.

389
00:33:25,633 --> 00:33:28,635
- Is that a coincidence?
- What do you think it is?

390
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:30,367
l can't be sure.

391
00:33:30,566 --> 00:33:32,267
l don't want to start a panic,

392
00:33:32,466 --> 00:33:34,034
but l think...

393
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:38,902
l think it's some kind of bacteria
that splits the skin.

394
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:41,936
Fortunately, so far,
it's just confined to males,

395
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:43,734
but who can tell?

396
00:33:43,933 --> 00:33:46,468
l'm not prepared to fight
this kind of thing.

397
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:49,168
l don't have the tools
or the know-how.

398
00:33:49,366 --> 00:33:51,101
l don't have the drugs!

399
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:54,803
- Will you excuse me, doc?
- Sure.

400
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,634
Just talk?

401
00:33:57,833 --> 00:33:59,601
- That's it?
- That's it.

402
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:02,536
- For $600?
- Yeah.

403
00:34:02,733 --> 00:34:06,002
These are the 1880s,
$600 is a fortune.

404
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,037
Los Angeles real estate is going
for 50 cents an acre. An acre!

405
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:13,102
- l can get a steak for a dime.
- That's wonde_ul.

406
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,502
- Hi, Miss Tracy.
- Hi.

407
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:17,935
Would you excuse me?

408
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,534
OK.

409
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:23,935
- You wanted to see me, Miss Tracy?
- Yes.

410
00:34:24,133 --> 00:34:27,369
You know that stranger
in here yesterday?

411
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:30,468
The one whose trousers
virtually suck to his legs.

412
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:32,134
Yes, ma'am.

413
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:34,234
Where's he hanging out?

414
00:34:34,433 --> 00:34:36,935
You know what l mean, hanging out?

415
00:34:37,133 --> 00:34:40,936
Yeah, yeah, he has a campsite
just outside of town.

416
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:42,767
What's his name?

417
00:34:42,966 --> 00:34:44,734
You know, his handle.

418
00:34:44,933 --> 00:34:47,869
Rex O'Herlihan,
The Singing Cowboy.

419
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:51,469
- The what?
- The Singing Cowboy.

420
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,968
Well, l want him.

421
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,834
l want to...

422
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,169
Tell the mule what happened.
Go on, tell him.

423
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:11,034
lt was something.

424
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:12,634
Really something.

425
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:16,069
Those guys even had
scope rifles too.

426
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:23,101
Yeah, it was incredible.

427
00:35:26,933 --> 00:35:29,802
l knew the whole plan,
but who cares about that?

428
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,670
The thing of it was... The thing
was jumping on top of Wildfire

429
00:35:33,866 --> 00:35:36,268
and those guys hitting the brakes.

430
00:35:39,233 --> 00:35:40,467
Help.

431
00:35:46,166 --> 00:35:48,368
On, Wildfire, on!

432
00:35:54,633 --> 00:35:55,867
Help!

433
00:36:04,533 --> 00:36:07,168
Whoa, whoa.

434
00:36:24,966 --> 00:36:26,534
Where am l?

435
00:36:28,466 --> 00:36:32,303
ln a small village,
just north of Oslo, Nomay.

436
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,334
Really?

437
00:36:35,366 --> 00:36:36,900
No.

438
00:36:37,366 --> 00:36:41,036
Actually, you're a few miles
outside of Oa_ood Estates.

439
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:45,669
Oh, you were teasing me,
weren't you?

440
00:36:46,966 --> 00:36:48,367
Yep.

441
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:50,935
Oh, l like that.

442
00:36:54,533 --> 00:36:54,533
Evey time Rex got close to having
some sort of relationship with a girl,

443
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:58,835
Evey time Rex got close to having
some sort of relationship with a girl,

444
00:36:59,033 --> 00:37:01,935
you could bet something else
would happen.

445
00:37:02,766 --> 00:37:06,736
- Thanks for washing my dress.
- Oh, my pleasure.

446
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:10,403
l never have problems
with ground-in dirt stains.

447
00:37:10,666 --> 00:37:12,968
Blood and chocolate
are the tough ones.

448
00:37:16,866 --> 00:37:19,068
Do you live around here?

449
00:37:19,666 --> 00:37:22,068
Oh, you work around here, then.

450
00:37:22,466 --> 00:37:23,700
You're on vacation.

451
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:26,234
No, not really.

452
00:37:27,633 --> 00:37:30,035
- l wanna thank you...
- You know...

453
00:37:30,266 --> 00:37:31,500
- You go.
- No, you.

454
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:35,470
- No, you.
- Well, what l was gonna say was

455
00:37:36,099 --> 00:37:38,268
it certainly is some horse of yours.

456
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:41,836
Yes! Oh, he's been dragging me
around since last night.

457
00:37:42,033 --> 00:37:44,735
He's an Arabian.
They have great stamina.

458
00:37:44,933 --> 00:37:46,567
Yeah, l know.

459
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,768
His name is Wildfire.

460
00:37:49,366 --> 00:37:52,268
- What?
- His name is Wildfire.

461
00:37:52,466 --> 00:37:55,001
- Are you kidding me?
- No, l don't think so.

462
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:57,168
My horse's name is Wildfire!

463
00:37:57,366 --> 00:37:58,700
- No!
- Yes.

464
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,103
- That's amazing.
- That's an incredible coincidence.

465
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,468
Don't you iust love
the name Wildfire?

466
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:06,768
Yeah, it's the greatest, the best.

467
00:38:06,966 --> 00:38:08,801
Have you got more of that plant?

468
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,802
Oh, yeah, sure,
there's some in the...

469
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,334
What?

470
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:15,835
What is it?

471
00:38:17,866 --> 00:38:20,969
Oh, don't wory about it.
You're just getting paranoid.

472
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,967
Someone's coming.

473
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,470
- l don't hear anything.
- Trust me, someone's coming.

474
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:30,802
Hide in those trees down there
just for a little while.

475
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,102
- Why?
- Well, how does it look?

476
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:38,537
Here you are, a nice girl without
any clothes on, and l'm a good guy.

477
00:38:38,866 --> 00:38:40,234
l'd appreciate it.

478
00:38:40,433 --> 00:38:41,667
All right.

479
00:38:41,866 --> 00:38:45,603
- In the trees?
- Yeah. Just for a couple of minutes.

480
00:38:49,633 --> 00:38:51,901
- What's your name, by the way?
- Rex.

481
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:53,734
Oh, my gosh.

482
00:38:53,933 --> 00:38:56,769
- What?
- My dog's name is Rex.

483
00:39:18,933 --> 00:39:20,467
Hello, Rex.

484
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,168
Hi.

485
00:39:23,566 --> 00:39:25,367
Remember me?

486
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:29,069
Yeah, you're Miss Tracy, the town...

487
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:30,801
Hostess.

488
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:33,035
Yeah. Right.

489
00:39:33,366 --> 00:39:34,600
Howdy, ma'am.

490
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:36,700
Howdy.

491
00:39:39,966 --> 00:39:42,268
Most men l know
only have one gun.

492
00:39:42,466 --> 00:39:43,900
Huh?

493
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:47,302
Oh, sory about that.

494
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:49,534
l'm kind of busy here.

495
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:53,269
l have to feed the fire
and keep the horses maintained.

496
00:39:53,633 --> 00:39:57,269
Come on, Rex, can't you
even offer a girl a drink?

497
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,869
OK. One quick drink.
Why not?

498
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,202
l have a bottle of shery
that my mother sent me.

499
00:40:07,066 --> 00:40:09,468
Hasn't been opened since Christmas.

500
00:40:09,666 --> 00:40:12,201
l don't usually drink myself,
you understand.

501
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:15,202
OK, one little shery...

502
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,567
Well?

503
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:23,669
Oh, Miss Tracy,
you got the wrong guy, really.

504
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:26,368
l'm ready, Rex.

505
00:40:26,566 --> 00:40:28,200
Ready for what?

506
00:40:28,699 --> 00:40:33,271
A nice, long conversation.

507
00:40:33,466 --> 00:40:38,070
Oh, no, no, no, you don't understand.
l can't talk like that.

508
00:40:38,533 --> 00:40:40,134
So sing it.

509
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:42,301
l'd love to, but l...

510
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:44,800
What is it?

511
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,735
Someone's coming.

512
00:40:46,933 --> 00:40:49,802
- Someone's coming?
- Yeah, out there.

513
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,770
- You'd better hide behind that boulder.
- Why?

514
00:40:54,233 --> 00:40:57,603
Why? You're in your undemear,
and l'm... You know.

515
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,435
- l'm a straight shooter.
- Good.

516
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:04,703
Oh, please get behind that boulder.
It won't be long.

517
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:08,203
As a special favor to me.

518
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:10,734
OK.

519
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,868
But you owe me.

520
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,868
Thank you so much.

521
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:36,868
l told you to hide.

522
00:41:37,066 --> 00:41:40,702
- l heard a woman's voice.
- What? No, you didn't. That was...

523
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,636
That's iust some old
hoot owl hooting.

524
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,768
Whose cape is this?

525
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:50,869
Mine. This is iust part of my stuff.

526
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:53,968
lt's cold out here, don't you think?

527
00:41:54,866 --> 00:41:58,069
- Rex, are you OK?
- l'm fine, fine, just fine.

528
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:01,202
Go hide in the trees.
l'll call you when it's safe.

529
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,135
OK.

530
00:42:07,466 --> 00:42:09,467
Oh, what a night!

531
00:42:13,433 --> 00:42:15,968
Hi. Remember me?

532
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:20,470
- Sure, you're the town drunk.
- Yeah.

533
00:42:20,933 --> 00:42:24,303
- How do you like my new outfit?
- It's nice, vey nice.

534
00:42:24,866 --> 00:42:27,535
- So is yours.
- Thank you.

535
00:42:28,533 --> 00:42:31,769
- Mine's a sidekick outfit.
- l know.

536
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,302
And you don't have a sidekick,
am l right?

537
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,001
That's right.

538
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:38,935
Well...

539
00:42:40,633 --> 00:42:42,434
What about me?

540
00:42:42,633 --> 00:42:44,634
Now, look...

541
00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:47,101
- Peter.
- Look, Peter,

542
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,403
l don't have a sidekick.
l ride alone. That's my style.

543
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:52,969
You could use a sidekick,
couldn't you?

544
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:56,702
No, sory, but even my theme song
says l ride alone.

545
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,335
l ride alone

546
00:43:00,533 --> 00:43:02,101
Change it.

547
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,603
- It took me four years to get that right.
- It did?

548
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,603
There's no sidekick opening.
So if you'll excuse me, l have to...

549
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,336
Mr. O'Herlihan, now, look,
l could provide comedy relief.

550
00:43:13,533 --> 00:43:16,135
What's gonna happen to me
in Oa_ood Estates?

551
00:43:16,466 --> 00:43:18,467
l'm iust the town drunk.

552
00:43:18,666 --> 00:43:21,869
l want more than that.
l wanna see the world.

553
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:26,070
- l wanna see other towns at least.
- They're all the same.

554
00:43:26,266 --> 00:43:28,835
But you don't know that for sure.

555
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,668
l do, Peter.

556
00:43:30,866 --> 00:43:35,203
l know lots of things. One thing l know
for sure is l can't have a sidekick,

557
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,101
even if l wanted one.

558
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:39,434
You see,

559
00:43:39,633 --> 00:43:41,801
l know what happens.

560
00:43:42,366 --> 00:43:43,834
l know the future.

561
00:43:44,766 --> 00:43:46,167
What?

562
00:43:46,733 --> 00:43:49,769
Look, please go.

563
00:43:51,766 --> 00:43:53,267
OK.

564
00:43:53,466 --> 00:43:55,000
OK.

565
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:57,768
OK.

566
00:43:57,966 --> 00:44:00,601
l made a fool out of myself again.

567
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,371
l ought to iust go back to the gutter
where l belong.

568
00:44:05,566 --> 00:44:08,435
- What are you doing?
- Getting out of this outfit.

569
00:44:08,633 --> 00:44:10,468
My drunk suit's here in the bag.

570
00:44:10,666 --> 00:44:12,768
Can l have my drink, please?

571
00:44:13,266 --> 00:44:15,801
- Who was that?
- Somebody who wants a drink.

572
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,501
The range is full of them.

573
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:20,468
l dropped the blanket in the dark.

574
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:23,402
That's OK. l'll find it tomorrow.

575
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,801
You gave her a blanket?

576
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,602
l had to nearly rape you
for a lousy shery.

577
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,538
He rides alone? You're the most
un-alone guy l ever met.

578
00:44:33,699 --> 00:44:36,069
Look, l can explain all of this.

579
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,334
Oh, no.

580
00:44:39,733 --> 00:44:41,901
- Now what?
- The sheepherders.

581
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:43,968
The sheepherders!

582
00:44:44,166 --> 00:44:47,969
Oh, Rex, they can't see me here.
l'm the cattle baron's daughter.

583
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:49,867
You are?

584
00:44:50,866 --> 00:44:52,400
Mr. Rex.

585
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:54,501
Over here!

586
00:44:55,099 --> 00:44:56,801
Over here!

587
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:01,134
- Hello.

588
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,268
- Hello.
- Hello.

589
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,670
We're informal tonight.
l wasn't expecting you till tomorrow.

590
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:15,404
- You knew we were coming?
- He knows the future.

591
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,836
Why don't you come on in.
Just grab a seat anmhere.

592
00:45:19,033 --> 00:45:21,001
- Thank you.
- Anmhere you like.

593
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:24,002
Fine, fine. Good, good.

594
00:45:27,533 --> 00:45:30,836
- Mr. Rex, we need your help.
- l know.

595
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:32,668
You do?

596
00:45:33,466 --> 00:45:36,602
Yesterday, in the bar,
they shot my son.

597
00:45:36,933 --> 00:45:39,235
l'm sory, l didn't know
he was your son.

598
00:45:39,433 --> 00:45:43,336
Oh, please, Mr. Rex,
you must help us!

599
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:46,636
- You are our only hope!
- l understand.

600
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:49,502
- Without you, we are doomed!
- l know.

601
00:45:49,699 --> 00:45:53,804
- Doomed, l tell you! Doomed!
- OK, he gets it. OK?

602
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,236
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- Oh, sir.

603
00:45:57,433 --> 00:46:00,869
- Me?
- Yes. Don't wory. l'm gonna help you.

604
00:46:01,066 --> 00:46:05,637
Someone like me always helped you,
is helping you and always will help you.

605
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,270
- What?
- Excuse me, what is this?

606
00:46:11,466 --> 00:46:13,234
lt's iust a root.

607
00:46:14,133 --> 00:46:16,468
From now on,
l'm the town root junkie.

608
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,034
- Sir.
- What?

609
00:46:19,233 --> 00:46:22,836
The cattlemen have ioined forces
with the railroad guys.

610
00:46:24,466 --> 00:46:27,502
lf you scream one more time,
l'll tear your heart out.

611
00:46:28,066 --> 00:46:32,069
Sir, l cannot defeat the cattlemen
and the railroad guys by myself.

612
00:46:32,266 --> 00:46:34,201
l'll need the help
of sheepherders.

613
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:37,903
Oh, no, Mr. Rex, we don't fight.

614
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:39,835
We don't believe in that.

615
00:46:40,033 --> 00:46:44,637
Let the old men who start the wars
fight the wars. That's our motto.

616
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,969
l'll fight them by myself.
It's not a big problem.

617
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:50,500
No, you won't!

618
00:46:50,699 --> 00:46:52,134
l'll fight them with you.

619
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:54,668
- You and me together, Rex.
- No.

620
00:46:54,866 --> 00:46:58,402
Oh, give him a break, Rex.
He wants it so much.

621
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:01,602
- You know what l'm saying?
- Oh, please!

622
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,136
Then let him fight. He wants to fight.
He's a young man.

623
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:07,168
Come on, do something different.

624
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:10,001
l'm the only one here
that knows what's gonna happen.

625
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:13,870
He wants to fight. Let him fight.
He's a young man.

626
00:47:17,866 --> 00:47:21,536
And that's how me and Rex
actually got together.

627
00:47:21,733 --> 00:47:23,968
l'll never forget that next day.

628
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:42,635
At first, he was tying
tD get rid of me.

629
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:44,067
Come on.

630
00:47:44,933 --> 00:47:47,502
You wanna be a sidekick,
Iearn the ropes.

631
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,634
OK, Rex.

632
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:51,234
OK.

633
00:47:55,766 --> 00:47:58,201
Good. Vey good.

634
00:47:58,466 --> 00:47:59,934
Thank you.

635
00:48:00,133 --> 00:48:02,635
Thank you vey much.

636
00:48:25,966 --> 00:48:27,467
OK.

637
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,569
But later, he and l
wrote a song together,

638
00:48:48,766 --> 00:48:53,804
and because l could sing real good,
l started winning him over.

639
00:48:54,566 --> 00:48:57,168
That's great. Great chords.
Let's do it again.

640
00:48:58,966 --> 00:49:03,170
l'll get by

641
00:49:03,366 --> 00:49:07,803
l'll wait until the rivers run dy

642
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,437
lf it takes a million years
Girl, l

643
00:49:12,633 --> 00:49:17,270
Will know a million years
Can't come too soon

644
00:49:17,633 --> 00:49:22,104
Somehow, somewhere

645
00:49:23,033 --> 00:49:27,670
Our eyes will meet
And then and there

646
00:49:27,866 --> 00:49:32,437
The spa_s will set
A magic night on fire

647
00:49:32,633 --> 00:49:42,275
And l'll lasso you the moon

648
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:48,734
That's terrific.

649
00:49:49,733 --> 00:49:51,434
Great!

650
00:49:53,966 --> 00:49:55,967
Come on, we're going for a swim.

651
00:49:56,166 --> 00:49:59,002
- l don't know, Rex.
- Oh, there's nothing to it.

652
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:02,269
- l'm a little nervous.
- It's just water.

653
00:50:15,433 --> 00:50:19,670
l really had no idea what this iob
was all about.

654
00:50:20,466 --> 00:50:22,267
lt's not easy.

655
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,001
l'll tell you, Rex,

656
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:34,705
if it wasn't for these roots,
l bet l'd be sore all over.

657
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,435
Well, time to hit the sack.

658
00:50:39,166 --> 00:50:40,400
Night, Peter.

659
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:42,568
Pleasant dreams, Rex.

660
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,468
Hey, Rex.

661
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:51,435
lt's a silly question, l guess,

662
00:50:51,633 --> 00:50:53,935
but do you really know the future?

663
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,136
- Yes.
- Wanna explain that?

664
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,369
l told you, all those towns
are the same.

665
00:51:06,766 --> 00:51:08,234
J
Well

666
00:51:08,466 --> 00:51:12,636
the same thing keeps happening
in all these towns.

667
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,769
The bad guys, who are usually rich
for some reason,

668
00:51:16,966 --> 00:51:20,769
are always taking advantage of
the good guys, who are usually poor.

669
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:24,335
l ride into town and ioin forces
with the good guys,

670
00:51:24,533 --> 00:51:28,103
defeat the bad guys,
and then l ride out. Over and over.

671
00:51:29,933 --> 00:51:31,601
lt's my karma, l guess.

672
00:51:32,133 --> 00:51:33,367
Your what?

673
00:51:35,966 --> 00:51:39,669
Ty to get some sleep, Peter.
Tomorrow's the big shootout.

674
00:51:40,366 --> 00:51:42,267
OK.

675
00:51:48,633 --> 00:51:50,334
Shootout?

676
00:51:51,666 --> 00:51:55,836
Look, l painted a circle around
Isabel's eye. What do you think?

677
00:51:56,033 --> 00:51:57,534
l think you're weird.

678
00:51:57,733 --> 00:52:01,636
Rex, about this shootout,
what are your plans?

680
00:52:02,699 --> 00:52:07,838
Oh, l don't know. l guess l'll shoot
the guns out of their hands.

681
00:52:10,166 --> 00:52:11,433
J
Well

682
00:52:11,633 --> 00:52:13,935
how many will there be?

683
00:52:14,133 --> 00:52:15,834
l don't know.

684
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:17,401
Don't know?

685
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,502
- l thought you knew the future.
- Oh, in general.

686
00:52:20,699 --> 00:52:22,068
ln general?

687
00:52:22,266 --> 00:52:24,401
No specifics?

688
00:52:25,266 --> 00:52:27,468
Maybe l should buy me
a steel helmet.

689
00:52:27,666 --> 00:52:29,701
You wanted the sidekick iob.

690
00:52:40,266 --> 00:52:41,800
l don't see anybody.

691
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,701
This is it.

692
00:53:02,133 --> 00:53:04,468
Holy mackerel.

693
00:53:11,633 --> 00:53:13,534
l made a mistake.

694
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,501
We can't beat this many men.

695
00:53:17,166 --> 00:53:18,767
Now...?

696
00:53:19,266 --> 00:53:21,101
Now you realize that?

697
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,302
l mean, damn, Rex.

698
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,570
- For a guy who knows the future...
- There's too many of them.

699
00:53:28,766 --> 00:53:32,703
Forty percent chicken out. l didn't
think they'd have a good turnout.

700
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,868
What are we gonna do?

701
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,469
- l'm thinking.
- Good.

702
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:39,900
Good.

703
00:53:40,566 --> 00:53:45,404
Eveyone whose birthday occurs
on an even-numbered day, aim at Rex.

704
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,136
Eveyone with an odd-numbered
birthday, aim at the nerd.

705
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,603
l'll distract them. When l give you
the word, you ride away.

706
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,034
No problem.

707
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,568
Ready, aim...

708
00:53:58,766 --> 00:54:01,235
Let me do it. Let me do it.
l want to do it.

709
00:54:01,433 --> 00:54:02,834
Fine, l don't care.

710
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:04,534
Ready!

711
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:06,934
Aim!

712
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,668
He is vey good.

713
00:55:15,266 --> 00:55:18,168
- Wish my horse could do that.
- Me too.

714
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,835
Let's get out of here.

715
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,601
Take off!

716
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,301
Now!

717
00:55:43,266 --> 00:55:45,501
Don't iust stand there.
After them, men!

718
00:55:46,033 --> 00:55:48,969
We can't go after them.
We're up here on this ridge.

719
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,234
Gee whiz!

720
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,668
You told us to get up here.

721
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,535
We need to talk.

722
00:55:56,733 --> 00:55:59,035
This is really embarrassing.

723
00:56:00,666 --> 00:56:01,900
Go, Isabel!

724
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:05,002
This sort of thing
drove the bad guys crazy.

725
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:09,003
And they did eveything
they could think of tD get rid of us.

726
00:56:13,733 --> 00:56:15,868
Of course, it never worked.

727
00:56:16,066 --> 00:56:19,569
ln the first place, Rex always knew
what they were gonna do

728
00:56:19,766 --> 00:56:21,501
before they did it.

729
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:28,637
Good night, boys.
See you tomorrow.

730
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:34,238
And in the second place, they were
the bad guys, so they couldn't win.

731
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:41,435
- Jud.
- Yes, sir.

732
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:44,201
Throw another fagot on the fire.

733
00:56:47,933 --> 00:56:49,367
What?

734
00:56:49,566 --> 00:56:53,169
Another log.
Throw another log on the fire.

735
00:56:53,366 --> 00:56:55,501
- Yes, sir, right away.
- Damn.

736
00:56:57,466 --> 00:57:00,001
- We know one thing.
- What?

737
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:04,003
Brute force doesn't work.
He always outsmarts us.

738
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:05,434
That's right.

739
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,470
That means we've got to outsmart him.

740
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,768
The problem is,

741
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:17,568
we are bad and he's good,

742
00:57:17,766 --> 00:57:19,934
so he always beats us.

743
00:57:20,133 --> 00:57:22,301
That's the problem.

744
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,168
- Wait a minute.
- What?

745
00:57:27,966 --> 00:57:29,600
That's it.

746
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,168
l've got it!

747
00:57:31,366 --> 00:57:35,069
- Got what?
- A truly great idea!

748
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,936
What the colonel had
was a truly great idea.

749
00:57:45,133 --> 00:57:48,302
All we knew, at the time,
was what usually happened.

750
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:52,437
The bad guys would get a hired gun
and a shootout would follow.

751
00:57:52,633 --> 00:57:55,902
But l could tell
Rex was getting a little edgy.

752
00:57:58,033 --> 00:58:01,803
lt was like he knew something
was going tD happen

753
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,336
that hadn't happened before.

754
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,302
- When is the showdown?
- What?

755
00:58:09,699 --> 00:58:11,802
When is this guy gonna come to town?

756
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,736
Tomorrow. l fight him tomorrow.

757
00:58:15,866 --> 00:58:20,103
Well, what do you wanna do now?
Wanna go swimming or iron shirts?

758
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,701
Swim or shirts?

759
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,568
Go back to camp.
l need some time alone.

760
00:58:25,766 --> 00:58:28,702
- Come on, Rex.
- l need some me time.

761
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,401
''Me time''?

762
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:34,503
Hey, hey, how about
l have the girls out?

763
00:58:34,699 --> 00:58:35,934
No.

764
00:58:36,133 --> 00:58:38,401
- Don't you like girls, Rex?
- Yes!

765
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:41,669
Yes, l like them vey much.

766
00:58:42,033 --> 00:58:44,201
l'll see you tonight, Peter.

767
00:58:44,966 --> 00:58:46,734
So long, Rex.

768
00:58:53,366 --> 00:58:55,234
On, Wildfire, on!

769
00:59:16,966 --> 00:59:19,068
Let's take it on home, Miss Tracy.

770
00:59:23,733 --> 00:59:30,005
l ride alone

771
00:59:31,033 --> 00:59:34,269
l was good that time.
We'll finally get this thing right.

772
00:59:34,466 --> 00:59:36,201
Hi, Rex.

773
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,503
Hey, Rex, how's tricks?
You know, tricks.

774
00:59:42,699 --> 00:59:43,934
What's going on here?

775
00:59:46,233 --> 00:59:47,968
Rex.

776
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,969
- l was lonely.
- You were lonely?

777
00:59:52,266 --> 00:59:55,902
You don't know what lonely is, sport.
May l have my guitar, please?

778
01:00:01,133 --> 01:00:03,835
l don't suppose you know
my mother gave me this

779
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:06,635
and l hold the copyright
on that song.

780
01:00:06,833 --> 01:00:08,334
No, l didn't.

782
01:00:09,133 --> 01:00:12,069
This is my campsite. l live here.

783
01:00:12,266 --> 01:00:13,634
l found the spot.

784
01:00:13,833 --> 01:00:17,069
l'm the one who put the rocks
in a circle to make a fire.

785
01:00:17,266 --> 01:00:21,169
Rex, l am completely out of line,
and it won't ever happen again.

786
01:00:21,633 --> 01:00:24,102
Correct. It won't, Peter.

787
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:31,970
Relax, Rex, we all iust had a root.

788
01:00:32,166 --> 01:00:34,868
You know, root.

789
01:00:35,733 --> 01:00:38,302
Oh, good, my roots!

790
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:41,502
Go ahead, eat them all.
Have a big old time.

791
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,402
But you're gonna have to excuse me.

792
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:48,202
Some of us have a gunfight tomorrow.

793
01:00:51,933 --> 01:00:53,534
Girls,

794
01:00:54,066 --> 01:00:57,302
l think you better get dressed and go.

795
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,635
He's not himself.

796
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,734
Rex.

797
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:12,934
Go home, Peter.

798
01:01:15,966 --> 01:01:17,567
OK.

799
01:01:18,033 --> 01:01:20,402
OK, l'm fired.

800
01:01:21,133 --> 01:01:23,101
l deserve it.

801
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,869
But l iust want to say one thing.

802
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:32,769
l hope you shoot Mr. Barber
in both hands.

803
01:01:33,233 --> 01:01:35,835
- Who?
- Barber.

804
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:38,635
- Bob Barber.
- Bob Barber?

805
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:41,435
That's what the colonel's daughter
called him.

806
01:01:41,633 --> 01:01:44,335
Not Bad Bob Barber?

807
01:01:44,533 --> 01:01:46,434
Bothersome Bob Barber?

808
01:01:46,633 --> 01:01:48,134
Bob ''The Butcher'' Barber?

809
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:50,335
No.

810
01:01:50,933 --> 01:01:53,135
No, iust Bob.

811
01:01:57,666 --> 01:02:00,468
Look, l'll see you later.

812
01:02:02,033 --> 01:02:03,834
lt's been fun.

813
01:02:55,466 --> 01:03:01,538
l can see by your ou_it
That you are a cowboy

814
01:03:01,733 --> 01:03:07,205
You can see by my oumit
l'm a cowboy tDo

815
01:03:28,266 --> 01:03:29,934
Hello, Rex.

816
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,969
Bob? Bob Barber?

817
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,301
Yep.

818
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:46,636
Though some folks call me
Wrangler Bob Barber.

819
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,234
Nice outfit.

820
01:03:50,666 --> 01:03:53,135
Thanks. So is yours.

821
01:03:55,633 --> 01:03:59,269
- Just something l threw together.
- Same here.

822
01:03:59,766 --> 01:04:02,034
You don't wear the same outfit
evey day?

823
01:04:02,233 --> 01:04:05,269
No, that's boring.

824
01:04:07,466 --> 01:04:09,467
Ever face another good guy before?

825
01:04:10,833 --> 01:04:13,902
- No.
- Me neither.

826
01:04:14,466 --> 01:04:16,334
Makes you wonder
what will happen.

827
01:04:16,533 --> 01:04:19,669
l guess the good guy will win,
just like always.

828
01:04:20,333 --> 01:04:23,002
Yep. Except we're both good guys.

829
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:25,902
Then l reckon the most good
good guy will win.

830
01:04:26,666 --> 01:04:30,002
- That's the way l figure too.
- Yep.

831
01:04:53,433 --> 01:04:56,235
You can't beat me, Bob.
You work for the colonels.

832
01:04:56,433 --> 01:04:59,602
That makes me the most good.
l don't see how l can lose.

833
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:03,670
Yeah. But l don't drink whiskey
with hair in it.

834
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:05,601
Me neither. l iust buy it.

835
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,903
l don't have the colonel's daughter,
who's practically a minor,

836
01:05:09,099 --> 01:05:11,602
out to my campsite after dark.

837
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:14,201
That was wrong, l admit...

838
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,604
ln the company of a known prostitute
and a notorious alcoholic.

839
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:23,236
- Yeah, you see, but they...
- True or false?

840
01:05:24,099 --> 01:05:26,435
- True, but...
- There were drugs present?

841
01:05:26,633 --> 01:05:29,168
- Well, you could say that.
- Yes or no?

842
01:05:29,366 --> 01:05:32,635
- Yes! What are you, a lamer?
- Used to be, yeah.

843
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:36,603
Look, l know this all sounds bad...

844
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:40,770
You did all this stuff, and you still
call yourself a good guy?

845
01:05:40,966 --> 01:05:43,368
Yeah. Yeah, you're damn right l do.

846
01:05:44,433 --> 01:05:47,836
- You don't have to curse.
- l'll curse if l want to!

847
01:05:48,033 --> 01:05:50,335
Damn, damn, hell, damn,

848
01:05:50,533 --> 01:05:53,035
tee-tee, do-do.

849
01:05:56,733 --> 01:06:00,536
Hold on, little buckaroos. You can't
be hearing language like that.

850
01:06:00,733 --> 01:06:05,170
Get on back to school, obey your
teachers and study really hard.

851
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,768
Nice going.

852
01:06:07,966 --> 01:06:11,669
l also understand you're 31 , single
and don't even date.

853
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:14,234
- What?
- The colonel told me.

854
01:06:14,433 --> 01:06:16,768
- What are you getting at?
- Nothing.

855
01:06:16,966 --> 01:06:19,668
Except we both know
in order to be a good guy,

856
01:06:19,866 --> 01:06:21,968
you gotta be
a confident heterosexual.

857
01:06:22,166 --> 01:06:25,102
- A what?
- A confident heterosexual.

858
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:29,970
Well, of course l know that.
Let's draw. l'll shoot you in both hands.

859
01:06:30,599 --> 01:06:34,437
OK. Since we're both good guys,
neither of us can draw first.

860
01:06:34,633 --> 01:06:37,502
- l'll count down from five.
- Let's go.

861
01:06:37,933 --> 01:06:40,235
Five, four...

862
01:06:40,433 --> 01:06:44,203
- You said, ''A confident heterosexual''?
- Yes.

863
01:06:45,866 --> 01:06:50,237
- l thought it was iust a heterosexual.
- No, it's a confident heterosexual.

864
01:06:50,433 --> 01:06:52,234
- You're sure?
- l'm sure.

865
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:56,301
l didn't know that.

866
01:06:58,433 --> 01:07:00,735
Don't wory, Rex,
l'm not gonna hurt you.

867
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:03,368
l'll iust shoot the guns
out of your hands.

868
01:07:05,433 --> 01:07:08,836
- Rather you shoot me in the heart.
- You know l can't do that.

869
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,968
Five.

870
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:14,035
- Four.
- Confident.

871
01:07:14,699 --> 01:07:16,268
Three.

872
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:19,568
- Two.
- Wait a minute. Hold it.

873
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:24,334
l can't fight you today.

874
01:07:25,533 --> 01:07:29,737
l'll fight you tomorrow
or maybe Thursday.

875
01:07:29,933 --> 01:07:32,568
Thursday would be good.
l'll see you then.

876
01:07:49,766 --> 01:07:53,202
And Rex backed down,
first time ever.

877
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,769
Right away,
evey_y got down on him.

878
01:07:55,966 --> 01:07:57,534
Coward!

879
01:07:58,033 --> 01:07:59,868
Pervert!

880
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,401
Libertine!

881
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:07,270
You know how people are. They're
probably like this in your hometown.

882
01:08:07,466 --> 01:08:08,934
Freethinker!

883
01:08:09,133 --> 01:08:10,934
Homo!

884
01:08:22,033 --> 01:08:23,601
No!

885
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,835
No! Hey, you!

886
01:08:27,166 --> 01:08:28,800
Never mind.

887
01:08:30,266 --> 01:08:33,736
Hey, you!
You can't talk to my friend like that!

889
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:47,969
Well, what are you gonna do?

890
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:49,834
Where will you go?

891
01:08:50,033 --> 01:08:51,667
l don't know.

892
01:08:52,033 --> 01:08:54,835
l'm certainly not
the good guy anymore.

893
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:58,670
l guess the first thing l'll do
is get some new clothes.

894
01:08:58,866 --> 01:09:01,668
Understated stuff, lots of browns.

895
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:05,535
Then l guess l'll have to sell Wildfire.

896
01:09:05,733 --> 01:09:07,167
What?

897
01:09:07,366 --> 01:09:10,102
l have to. He's too good a horse
for me now.

898
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:13,169
Hey. Hey, Rex.

899
01:09:13,366 --> 01:09:15,534
Let's get the targets
and go practice.

900
01:09:15,733 --> 01:09:20,237
Practice doesn't have anything
to do with it. It's all psychological.

901
01:09:20,433 --> 01:09:23,836
lf you're confident, you win.
If not, you lose. And l'm not.

902
01:09:24,033 --> 01:09:25,300
About what?

903
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,934
About...

904
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:29,534
About...

905
01:09:29,733 --> 01:09:33,269
You know what my life is like.
l'm on the road all the time.

906
01:09:33,466 --> 01:09:38,103
So you know, l kiss the girls,
and then l leave.

907
01:09:38,366 --> 01:09:42,436
That's all l do. l iust kiss them.
It never gets any further than that.

908
01:09:43,133 --> 01:09:46,970
This is 1884. You gotta date
and date and date and date,

909
01:09:47,166 --> 01:09:50,002
and sometimes mary them even,
before they'll...

910
01:09:50,199 --> 01:09:51,768
You know.

911
01:09:53,866 --> 01:09:55,500
Wait a minute.

912
01:09:56,333 --> 01:09:59,903
You mean, you've never...?

913
01:10:00,466 --> 01:10:02,067
Never.

914
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,436
My God, Rex.

915
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,902
You are a good guy.

916
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,101
He wouldn't fight.

917
01:10:14,533 --> 01:10:15,767
He's scared.

918
01:10:15,966 --> 01:10:18,668
lt's a combination of guilt
and insecurity.

919
01:10:18,866 --> 01:10:21,902
lt's obvious that he's not at home
with his sexuality.

920
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:24,735
- What?
- His sexuality.

921
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:27,334
J
Well

922
01:10:27,533 --> 01:10:31,370
that definitely finishes him
as a good guy.

923
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,803
You can't be a good guy and scared.

924
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:37,835
Well, l'm not so sure.

925
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:41,503
l want him taken care of permanently.

926
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:45,003
- Bob, you've got to go out and get him.
- l can't.

927
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:49,436
lf he's backed down, l can't go
after him. It wouldn't be nice.

928
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,635
Then we've got to draw him
back to you.

929
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,334
How?

930
01:10:56,766 --> 01:10:59,368
Do something despicable to him.

931
01:10:59,566 --> 01:11:03,303
Something so rotten
he'll have to come back in.

932
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,768
l can't have a hand in any of that.

933
01:11:06,199 --> 01:11:08,669
Of course, of course.

934
01:11:09,066 --> 01:11:11,768
- Cookie?
- Thanks.

935
01:11:14,366 --> 01:11:16,835
Rex must have known
something was up,

936
01:11:17,033 --> 01:11:20,569
because he took special precautions
with my safety.

937
01:11:20,766 --> 01:11:22,934
But he didn't care about himself.

938
01:11:23,133 --> 01:11:25,969
He even threw away his guns.

939
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:35,736
True to their word, the bad guys
did something despicable.

940
01:11:35,933 --> 01:11:41,571
Something that really made Rex mad
and didn't amuse me much either.

941
01:11:41,766 --> 01:11:43,467
Hey, drunk!

942
01:11:50,633 --> 01:11:52,801
Peter!

943
01:12:59,633 --> 01:13:01,067
On, Wildfire, on!

944
01:13:15,733 --> 01:13:17,568
Oh, good morning, Mr. Rex.

945
01:13:18,433 --> 01:13:20,668
Get your rifle and come with me.

946
01:13:20,899 --> 01:13:23,469
Oh, l'm sory, Mr. Rex.
l cannot do that.

947
01:13:23,666 --> 01:13:26,268
Let the old men who start the wars
fight the wars.

948
01:13:26,466 --> 01:13:30,970
Get your rifle and come with me,
or l'll shoot your wife in the shoulder.

949
01:14:58,766 --> 01:15:00,167
He's coming!

950
01:15:00,366 --> 01:15:01,734
He's coming!

951
01:15:01,933 --> 01:15:03,968
He's coming!

952
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:09,103
- And he's standing in the saddle!
- Standing in the saddle?

953
01:15:18,266 --> 01:15:20,067
lt's not important.

954
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:22,735
lt means nothing.
He's just showing off.

955
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:30,069
lt looks like he's brought
some folks with him.

957
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:20,968
l'm back, Bob.

958
01:16:21,666 --> 01:16:23,200
Morning, Rex.

959
01:16:23,399 --> 01:16:24,634
Nice to see you.

960
01:16:26,699 --> 01:16:28,568
Now!

961
01:16:38,633 --> 01:16:41,302
Just like you said, Rex!

962
01:16:46,133 --> 01:16:48,835
What?! Oh, now,
wait just a minute here.

963
01:16:49,033 --> 01:16:52,669
This really came out of the blue.
We shot that guy yesterday.

964
01:16:52,866 --> 01:16:54,100
- Twice.
- Twice!

965
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:57,736
- With shotguns.
- l mean, come on!

966
01:16:57,933 --> 01:17:02,504
You think Rex O'Herlihan doesn't know
that his sidekick always gets killed?

967
01:17:02,699 --> 01:17:05,002
Why didn't he hire me right away?

968
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:08,169
Why do you think
he made me wear this?

969
01:17:09,233 --> 01:17:14,304
Wake up, you iugheads. He's always
two steps ahead of guys like you.

970
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:19,271
l didn't know about the man on
the roof. l had nothing to do with this.

971
01:17:20,233 --> 01:17:24,337
l don't approve of your actions here.
We're gonna have to talk about it.

972
01:17:25,899 --> 01:17:27,401
l'm tired of talking.

973
01:17:33,699 --> 01:17:35,368
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

974
01:18:02,233 --> 01:18:03,467
Hold your fire!

975
01:18:05,966 --> 01:18:07,667
Hold your fire!

976
01:18:08,199 --> 01:18:11,403
No reason for anybody to get involved
except Bob and me.

977
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,535
Little late, big guy.

978
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,169
All my men are dead.

979
01:18:21,366 --> 01:18:23,901
Evey single one of them.

980
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:27,837
- Who will build the railroad now?
- Forget about the railroad.

981
01:18:28,033 --> 01:18:32,036
Forget the railroad?
That's vey simple for you to say.

982
01:18:32,233 --> 01:18:35,235
- We'll talk later.
- No. We'll talk now!

983
01:18:35,733 --> 01:18:37,835
l think you are overbearing.

984
01:18:38,033 --> 01:18:41,369
And l think he is...boring.

985
01:18:41,566 --> 01:18:45,403
And l wish l had never gotten involved
in any of this.

986
01:18:53,399 --> 01:18:55,468
Well, Rex, you wanna call it off?

987
01:18:56,366 --> 01:18:57,867
No.

988
01:18:58,266 --> 01:19:01,869
You started this. l'm gonna finish it.

989
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:07,302
- Five.
- Still got the same problems.

990
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,869
- Four.
- We could just walk away from it.

991
01:19:10,066 --> 01:19:12,301
- Three.
- Whatever you want.

992
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,401
- Two.
- Violence is no solution.

993
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,134
One.

994
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,768
You're not a good guy at all.

995
01:19:39,966 --> 01:19:41,967
l'm a lamer, you idiot!

996
01:19:52,333 --> 01:19:55,102
Rex. Rex.

997
01:19:55,533 --> 01:19:57,768
You shot him in the head.

998
01:19:57,966 --> 01:20:00,401
How do you feel about that?

999
01:20:01,133 --> 01:20:03,134
l missed his hand.

1000
01:20:04,066 --> 01:20:06,001
Rex. Rex!

1001
01:20:06,366 --> 01:20:08,968
Rex, are you all right?

1002
01:20:09,166 --> 01:20:10,567
Yeah.

1003
01:20:10,766 --> 01:20:13,568
Just let me rest here for a while.

1004
01:20:13,933 --> 01:20:15,768
Let me close my eyes.

1005
01:20:15,966 --> 01:20:17,300
Rex.

1006
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,935
Rex, don't die on me.

1007
01:20:20,199 --> 01:20:22,468
Please, Rex, please!

1008
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:24,834
l'll be all right, Peter.

1009
01:20:25,833 --> 01:20:28,101
Believe me, l know.

1010
01:20:29,966 --> 01:20:31,967
Hot diggity!

1011
01:20:32,166 --> 01:20:36,370
He's gonna be all right, eveybody.
He knows!

1012
01:20:42,366 --> 01:20:44,634
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1013
01:20:48,233 --> 01:20:50,034
Rex?

1014
01:20:51,633 --> 01:20:55,937
l can't help but feel a little responsible
for what's happened here today.

1015
01:20:57,100 --> 01:21:01,838
Would a totally sincere ''sory'' do?

1016
01:21:02,766 --> 01:21:05,068
Well, it's a start, colonel.

1017
01:21:05,266 --> 01:21:06,667
lt's a good start.

1018
01:21:07,833 --> 01:21:09,534
Thanks, Rex.

1019
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,268
- Boy, is he nice.
- Let me through.

1020
01:21:14,466 --> 01:21:16,734
Let me through. l'm a doctor.

1021
01:21:17,866 --> 01:21:21,402
That leg has to come off for sure.
Take him to my office.

1022
01:21:22,133 --> 01:21:24,735
Take it easy, you cow patties.
Don't hurt him!

1023
01:21:24,933 --> 01:21:26,167
- Peter?
- Right here.

1024
01:21:26,366 --> 01:21:28,768
- Get me a root, quick.
- On my way.

1025
01:21:29,166 --> 01:21:30,734
- Peter.
- Yeah, Rex.

1026
01:21:30,933 --> 01:21:33,001
- l need a clean shirt.
- Coming up.

1027
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:37,304
A blue one. The cobalt blue one
with the white suede yokes and cuffs.

1028
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,734
Right, Rex.

1029
01:21:39,033 --> 01:21:41,769
Not the turquoise one
with the white fringe.

1030
01:21:41,966 --> 01:21:43,467
Oh, no, no, no.

1031
01:21:43,666 --> 01:21:45,434
Get out of the way!

1032
01:21:45,699 --> 01:21:49,270
Hey, eveybody,
big party at my house!

1033
01:21:49,466 --> 01:21:53,703
Hey, hey, hey, it's bring your own.
l'm serious, now.

1034
01:21:53,899 --> 01:21:55,601
Bring your own!

1035
01:22:04,533 --> 01:22:06,768
These things always ended
with a party.

1036
01:22:06,966 --> 01:22:09,068
All the main characters
would show up.

1037
01:22:09,266 --> 01:22:10,667
Music would be playing.

1038
01:22:10,866 --> 01:22:14,469
Guys who were supposed to be dead
would be walking around.

1039
01:22:14,666 --> 01:22:16,601
Eveybody had a big old time.

1040
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,736
l'm not gone two minutes,
and you throw a party.

1041
01:22:20,333 --> 01:22:22,268
Peter, listen.

1042
01:22:22,466 --> 01:22:25,769
l'd like you to get the colonels
and the ladies out front.

1043
01:22:25,966 --> 01:22:28,601
Sure. How come?

1044
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,135
To say goodbye.
It's time l was moving on.

1045
01:22:31,333 --> 01:22:34,302
- It's time we were moving on.
- Peter.

1046
01:22:35,566 --> 01:22:38,235
Oa_ood Estates is your home.
You belong here.

1047
01:22:38,433 --> 01:22:42,470
- Baloney! l'm going with you, Rex.
- It's too dangerous.

1048
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:44,534
Rex. Rex, l'll be all right.

1049
01:22:44,733 --> 01:22:47,335
l'll wear my bulletproof vest all the time.
Even when we go swimming.

1050
01:22:47,533 --> 01:22:49,968
Peter, we were lucky this time.

1051
01:22:50,166 --> 01:22:52,201
l can't have your death on my hands.

1052
01:22:52,399 --> 01:22:56,403
l couldn't deal with it,
so please don't make me. OK?

1053
01:22:59,699 --> 01:23:01,535
J
Well

1054
01:23:02,333 --> 01:23:04,101
will you write?

1055
01:23:04,433 --> 01:23:06,735
Sure, of course l will.

1056
01:23:07,966 --> 01:23:09,934
Will you be back?

1057
01:23:10,133 --> 01:23:12,368
Hey, l'm on a circuit, aren't l?

1058
01:23:12,566 --> 01:23:14,367
Yeah.

1059
01:23:14,566 --> 01:23:17,068
OK, l'll meet you out front.

1060
01:23:19,366 --> 01:23:20,934
Yeah.

1061
01:23:21,833 --> 01:23:23,067
OK.

1062
01:23:34,899 --> 01:23:37,602
- So long, colonel.
- So long, Rex.

1063
01:23:45,533 --> 01:23:49,103
So long, silly dresser.
l'm gonna miss you.

1064
01:24:00,633 --> 01:24:04,670
While we were in
the doctor's office together,

1065
01:24:05,533 --> 01:24:07,935
we did more than iust talk.

1066
01:24:09,233 --> 01:24:11,234
l'm getting better.

1067
01:24:20,699 --> 01:24:22,568
Now, is that pe_ect or what?

1069
01:24:32,566 --> 01:24:34,100
Screw it!

1070
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:36,535
l'm going with him!

1071
01:24:39,699 --> 01:24:42,436
_diós, buckaroos!

1072
01:24:43,133 --> 01:24:46,269
- l knew that would happen.
- Oh, Daddy, we all did.

1073
01:24:50,433 --> 01:24:52,101
Rex!
