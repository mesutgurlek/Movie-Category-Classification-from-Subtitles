1
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,829
<i>I'll tell you a story
that's never been told</i>

2
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,429
<i>of raping and killing
and government gold</i>

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,879
<i>The place: Arizona</i>

4
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,791
<i>the year: '84</i>

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,159
<i>Sit back and I'll tell you some more</i>

6
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,875
<i>A 30-year captain just earning his pay</i>

7
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,429
<i>Was moving a shipment of bullion
that day</i>

8
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,670
<i>While men without honour were
waiting to test</i>

9
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,397
<i>the unwritten code of the West</i>

10
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,315
<i>It's the code of the West</i>

11
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,035
<i>You must honour your neighbour</i>

12
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,350
<i>The code of the West</i>

13
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,479
<i>To your own self be true</i>

14
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,630
<i>The code of the West</i>

15
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,479
<i>You must do unto others</i>

16
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,630
<i>Do unto others</i>

17
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,235
<i>before they do it unto you</i>

18
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,590
<i>That's the code of the West</i>

19
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,908
Time to close up the shop, shoemaker.

20
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,836
All right, come on, come on.

21
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,512
In your hole, rabbit.

22
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,435
Men.

23
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,235
Sgt. Foggers, we can't spare any men
to help you because of the war games.

24
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,276
Besides, they'd just attract attention.

25
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,670
You keep a weather eye
and you'll be relieved at first light.

26
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,751
- Now do your duty.
- Sir...

27
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,594
the Army's my home and I would protect
my home with my life.

28
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,791
I got it.

29
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,233
Watch yourself!

30
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,517
That's a lot of gold
for one inside man to guard.

31
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,795
That's a lot of soldier, Corporal.

32
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,996
Well, I still say it's a lot 
of gold, sir.

33
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,753
Firm up, Corporal. We're not civilians.

34
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,628
Giddyup.

35
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,509
- Get out of there.
- Quick, rabbit.

36
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,158
<i>Sweet yellow, sweet yellow</i>

37
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,437
<i>Sweet tangerine gold</i>

38
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,275
<i>You make a man fever
You make a man bold</i>

39
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,353
Okay, boys.
This is where we lose each other.

40
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,510
Why don't we bury
that shoemaker in the shaft?

41
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,070
No, we can't do that.
He's our alibi if things go good.

42
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,034
- He's an alibi?
- Yeah, it's his tunnel.

43
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,509
Yeah, but that don't make me
any less a deserter.

44
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,593
You ain't no deserter.
You're his hostage.

45
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,436
You cannot dispose of my life
like it was a chess piece!

46
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,157
You do everything right
and you've got some hope.

47
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,357
You do anything wrong
and I'll guarantee you pain.

48
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,919
Do you understand pain?

49
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,035
Yes.

50
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,030
- We'll divvy now, huh?
- No.

51
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,193
The gold stays with me until I bury it.

52
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,631
- It does?
- Yeah, it does.

53
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,072
Settle down.
You two are gonna spoil everything.

54
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,038
How do we find you?

55
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,033
We'll meet in Dolores.

56
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,635
I'm gonna take this gold and I'm gonna
bury it and I'm gonna make a map...

57
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,551
and I'm gonna get word to you later.

58
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,153
That's all right with me.

59
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,391
It'll be nice and cool in Dolores
in a couple of weeks. Right, Hilb?

60
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,948
I may get there just a little earlier.

61
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,077
If you do, just don't let me see you.

62
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,910
<i>So the town of Dolores</i>

63
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,152
<i>that morning in May</i>

64
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,390
<i>was in for an infamous day</i>

65
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,877
Damn, we rode her rough.

66
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,428
Yes, sir.

67
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,069
You're not paying attention, Jay.

68
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,552
This game is called
Find the Black Lady.

69
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,193
Where is she?

70
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,994
You're not watching right.
Use those eyes of yours. Here we go.

71
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,518
Pick her out.

72
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,153
Turn it over.

73
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,270
That's the lady right there.
When do the girlies get here?

74
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,796
By golly, you'd have won that one,
soldier, if you'd been playing.

75
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,236
Come on, Jay. Get in here
before he comes and gets me.

76
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,796
I got her this time, Lewt.

77
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,952
Well, let's make this
a little interesting. Say...

78
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,238
for a glass of ice-cold milk?

79
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,109
You're on.

80
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,952
Hot diggity damn!

81
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,192
Jay, what's this?

82
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,239
I thought milk was only $3 a glass.

83
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,434
It was, until the dairy got rustled.

84
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,193
Deal them up.

85
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,911
Look for the lady.

86
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,471
One more time, you hear?

87
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,678
- Mr. Cole.
- Mr. Quinlen.

88
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,678
- Now, did you take my wallet?
- I did.

89
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,997
Been holding that marker of yours so
long the name was getting faint on it.

90
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,679
Mr. Cole, you took too much.

91
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,750
I took too much?
Well, sorry, I only counted it once.

92
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,030
Now, if you'd just give me the $20...

93
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,389
Let's just say
we'll call that interest on your debt.

94
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,152
Let's say we don't!

95
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,794
That's gonna pay for your funeral,
 thief.

96
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,796
Come on, Doc. What the hell?

97
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,475
The next thing you know, we'll be having
a shootout at sundown or something.

98
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,552
You said it. You heard him say it.

99
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,355
Doc.

100
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,838
Hey, Doc, man...

101
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,548
Be there.

102
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,873
You opened your mouth
to the wrong man, Lewt.

103
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,590
He'll cut you pocket-high
as soon as you start to reach.

104
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,477
It does look like I stepped in it a bit,
doesn't it?

105
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,279
Find that lovely black young thing.

106
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,549
Damn!

107
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,035
Well...

108
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,751
I'm closing my little shop, boys.

109
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,551
Hey, come on.
Here, have a drink, come on.

110
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,035
No.

111
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,113
It's not my day.

112
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,590
Come on, gambler.
Let's play again, one more time.

113
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,951
How much you got there?

114
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,430
I got $20 of yours. Give me.

115
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,712
Come on, give me.

116
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,788
$60.

117
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,674
Jay, would you get me about that much
of that good stuff you got down there?

118
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,795
$60.

119
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,871
- Well, what have I got to lose?
- $60.

120
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,515
Are you sure you want to do this?

121
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,793
All right.
Watch for that lovely black thing.

122
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,679
Watch the lady.

123
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,439
Cole! Lewton Cole!

124
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,955
Lucky in cards, unlucky in love.

125
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,272
Is that what you want, boys?

126
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,630
Don't spend it all in one place, now.

127
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,799
Damn it, Cole! Get out here.

128
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,432
Buy the boys a drink.

129
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,992
You're yellow, Cole.

130
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,917
Let's get on with it.

131
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,592
<i>You don't draw with a stranger</i>

132
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,828
<i>if he's faster than you</i>

133
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,314
<i>You've sung your last ditty</i>

134
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,318
<i>you've kissed your last pretty</i>

135
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,315
<i>and played your last hand if you do</i>

136
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,719
<i>When fate is the dealer</i>

137
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,633
<i>you raise or you call</i>

138
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,556
<i>A chance-taking man
plays the cards as they fall</i>

139
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,877
<i>A map worth a killing</i>

140
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,918
<i>is worth tracking down</i>

141
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,755
<i>So off to Integrity town</i>

142
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,757
Right flank! Forward!

143
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,512
The flash powder they use made me all
squinty-eyed. Do you see that picture?

144
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,878
Of course, they didn't do
too much better by old Twostones here.

145
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,436
I sure don't like him.

146
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,397
Then don't vote for him.

147
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,195
Yeah.

148
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,110
Now that Riderra gold robbery
they're talking about here...

149
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,830
if them U.S. Marshals would
take any advice...

150
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,037
they'd look for that there shoemaker
down in Mexico.

151
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,839
Why, that Ortiz government
down there...

152
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,957
they'd make a deal for your teeth
if there was gold in them.

153
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,077
That's about the way
I think about it, too, John.

154
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,794
You did?

155
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,954
I guess we both figured it right, then.

156
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,553
I wish there were some bank robbers
up around here for us to chase after.

157
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,438
You done scared them all away
by bringing them back dead.

158
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,830
Well, that's the way
they wanted them: Dead or alive.

159
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,595
On that last job, though,
you only brought back half the loot.

160
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,029
Half is better than none, ain't it?

161
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,633
Know something, Tippin?
You probably wouldn't believe this...

162
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,756
but I once had a gold robbery
in the works.

163
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,434
- I mean me, I was gonna do it.
- What happened?

164
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,478
I had to give it up
when I was elected sheriff.

165
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,475
Started to believe my own slogans.

166
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,629
But I'm gonna tell you, if this
job wasn't so sweet and soft, why...

167
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,837
I might just elect to follow
the criminal profession.

168
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,070
You'd be real good, too, John.

169
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,833
Much obliged.

170
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,111
Hi, Sheriff. Say,
 I'm looking for a horse.

171
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,634
- I can see that.
- Whose horse you looking for?

172
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,871
Mine was pulled up lame yesterday...

173
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,868
and I'm heading out for a long ride
and looking for a good horse.

174
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,474
I ain't in the horse business, friend.

175
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,114
The best horse in the whole county...

176
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,998
is in a barn over at the other side
of Lone Tree Fork.

177
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,548
Belongs to the Sheriff here.
Ain't that right, John?

178
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,359
If you're talking about old Blue,
he ain't for sale.

179
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,431
Toppy kind, eh? Good rein on him?

180
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,956
Best damn rein in the county.
He ain't for sale, that's all.

181
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,318
See, if he ain't for sale, what that means
is that he ain't gonna sell him to you.

182
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,879
Ain't that right, John?

183
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,473
Good size, too?

184
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,912
He's the tallest, the strongest,
the fastest, and the ain't for sale-est.

185
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,635
Damn.

186
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,713
What the hell?

187
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,633
Say, that there's my "Out to Lunch"
sign and I ain't out to lunch.

188
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,151
In the cell, boys. Come on.

189
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,073
He's the one that's on the
poster outside, ain't that right?

190
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,354
Hold them up now.

191
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,472
Lewton Cole, a criminal.

192
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,676
Ain't that right, John? That's him.

193
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,433
- What's this mean, Cole?
- So I'll know where you're at.

194
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,919
- Where's the keys?
- Wait a minute.

195
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,276
If you think you're gonna lock me
in my own zoo, you're badly mistaken.

196
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,113
A set of keys is a small thing
to die over, don't you think?

197
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,919
- I don't remember where them keys are.
- He does remember.

198
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,709
That's what he meant to say.
They're right over there on the hat rack.

199
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,392
Thank you, Deputy.

200
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,320
Now, you're in a lot of trouble
and I'm warning you...

201
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,075
if you do a thing like this,
I ain't gonna show you no mercy.

202
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,470
Take off your clothes, Sheriff.

203
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,592
- Do what?
- Take off your clothes.

204
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,796
You mean you want for us
to take off everything that we got on?

205
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,279
Down to the last single stitch.

206
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,432
Put them in nice, neat little piles
right there on the floor.

207
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,637
Why are you doing this terrible thing
to me?

208
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,476
- A naked sheriff makes a slow posse.
- Damn!

209
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,272
Top of everything else, Cole, you're
contributing to indecent exposure.

210
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,355
Damn.

211
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,156
Being found locked naked
in your own jail...

212
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,033
in election year...

213
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,437
to be too noisy about it
might be bad politics.

214
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,589
Damn!

215
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,954
Bye-bye.

216
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,274
Damn!

217
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,078
He sure left us bare, ain't that right?

218
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,558
Three more eggs?

219
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,079
Francisco!

220

<i>A yellow-haired woman

221

228
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,038
- Well...
- All right, what are you doing here?

229
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,512
- Putting on my pants.
- What do you want?

230
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,352
I was gonna get on this big black horse
and ride him out of here, but...

231
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,558
Look, I'm not alone.

232
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,275
You mean Francisco?
Sleeping in the shade.

233
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,398
Besides, what's he gonna do?
Challenge me to a duel?

234
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,630
Take a poke at me or something?

235
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,518
I outweigh him.
He might take a shot at me...

236
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,157
but he don't have no gun.

237
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,038
Well, my daddy does.
And he's the sheriff of this county.

238
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,277
Yeah, I know. I seen him.

239
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,515
You must take after your mama.

240
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,310
You're gonna have to take it.

241
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,673
Don't make me.

242
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,472
You gotta cock it to shoot me.

243
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,149
See, now it's on safety.
You gotta pull it all the way back.

244
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,554
Bastard.

245
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,108
Now I had no control over that.

246
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,557
Now, easy now. You're supposed to
wear yourself out loving, not fighting.

247
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,632
No, you can't do it this way.

248
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,636
Slow. Easy.

Francisco! Where's that Mexican?

258
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,069
Francisco! Come on, Pancho,
get up out of there! Come on!

259
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,914
Now get them guns and that tack off of
that mule and get them on Big Blue...

260
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,752
and I want Billee's sorrel, too.

261
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,239
The sorrel is not shod yet.

All right. I'll pick up a
relief horse going south.

<i>- Hey, patrón.
- What?</i>

265
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,712
- Where'd you get these clothes?
- I got them at the undertaker's.

266
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,360
- Go on in there and get Big Blue.
- Daddy, Big Blue's...

267
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,512
No, don't interrupt me now, Billee.
I'm on a case.

268
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,760
You look like a mess.
What happened to you?

269
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,353
- You all right, ain't you?
- No.

270
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,032
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

271
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,669
- I ain't got no time to fool around.
- Wait a minute.

272
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,432
I think he raped me.

273
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,432
Who? Francisco?

274
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,351
- Daddy!
- Well, who then?

275
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,312
He's big and tall...

276
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,472
- and mean and cruel...
- I didn't see nobody coming up the road.

277
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,232
- Where'd he go?
- Right into the desert.

What do you mean, gone?

280
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,794
I tried to tell you he took Blue, too.

281
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,116
No, he ain't gone. He...

282
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,879
He took Blue with him?
He took that horse?

283
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,673
He took that...

284
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,353
Wait a minute.

285
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,635
Was your man wearing a gambler's coat
and a little brown vest?

286
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,714
- Part of the time.
- Yeah. Cole.

287
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,590
That man must hate me personal.

288
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,070
What'd he go out there for? There ain't
nothing in the desert but desert.

289
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,673
That's where he went.

290
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,274
All right, get that gear on that mule.

291
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,753
Take my Big Blue out in that desert.

292
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,230
- Daddy, is that all you care about?
- I'll make it up to you.

00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,471
You gotta remember, a man picks
his pleasure from the nearest tree.

If you weren't my own daughter, I'd...
I mean there's worse things.

295
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,549
He could have killed you. Now that'd
have been worse, wouldn't it? I think.

296
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,677
- You bring him back.
- Yeah, I'll bring him back.

297

315
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,159

318
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,113
There's two waterholes to go.
We're gonna get him at one of them.

319
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,233
You want any?

320
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,791
Well, it ain't too bad.

321
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,676
It ain't gonna get any better
at the next one, either.

322
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,755
<i>Poor tumbleweed stumbling

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,395

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,396
<i>Rest your head on your saddle</i>

329
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,595
Damn.

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,989
<i>Dream of fortune and fame</i>

00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,557
Okay, baby, good boy.

335
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,199
Damn, mule,
I wish you hadn't done that.

336
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,837
Hold still now, mule. 
Damn it, hold still!

337
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,592
Up, show me the goodies.

338
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,832
Morning, Sheriff.

339
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,275
Kind of cold in there, ain't it?

340
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,472
Well, it's a little chilly.
Not too bad, though.

341
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,630
You're going for that gun, are you?
I wish you would go for it.

342
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,392
Please, go for it.

343
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,911
I don't need to now, Sheriff.
I got all of yours.

344
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,869
Damn.

345
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,116
"Property of the U.S. Army."

346
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,156
What's in it? General Grant's head?

347
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,038
If I guess right,
 there's bullion in there.

348
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,878
Riderra robbery?

349
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,749
If it is, there's over 100 pounds
of that fine yellow gold.

350
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,152
- Wait, what are you doing?
- I'm trying to get this thing open.

351
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,595
You just get up out of there.
I'll get it open.

352
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,318
- Come on, Sheriff.
- Now do as I say.

353
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,550
Get up and move on over there.

354
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,030
What the hell, Sheriff. I found it.
I get to open it.

355
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,518
Damn! It's gold!

356
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,796
- Damn, it's heavy, isn't it?
- Oh, my.

357
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,268
Damn!

358
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,151
Why didn't you shoot me a little
while ago with that little gun?

359
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,229
Well, Sheriff, I need protection.

360
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,798
This here gold
needs my protection, too.

361
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,595
Come on, Sheriff.

362
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,955
Oh, no, boy, we're gonna load it
on my horse.

363
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,712
- Your horse?
- Yep.

364
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,198
Yes, of course.

365
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,758
Well, you mind if I put on
my dry britches?

366
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,514
You go and put on some dry britches.

367
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,879
Hey, Cole.

368
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:29,356
What do you reckon the thieves figured
they could get for this gold in Mexico?

369
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,433
What's funny?

370
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,711
I just feel good, that's all, Sheriff.
You don't mind me feeling good, do you?

371
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,437
But in answer
to your little question, Sheriff...

372
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,956
I imagine those thieves...

373
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,117
if they got across the river
without sinking too deep in the sand...

374
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,919
and got by those Mexican bandits...

375
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,952
and they knew how to make a deal
down there...

376
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,191
I imagine those thieves
might get in upwards to...

377
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,118
$100,000.

378
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,393
You reckon?

379
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,948
I reckon.

380
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,071
Now wait a minute there.

381
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,233
Just give me that stingy little gun.
Come on.

382
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,993
How's it look?

383
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,912
Well, Sheriff...

384
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,472
a little touch of gold
always looks good on a man.

385
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,713
I got something
that's gonna look good on you.

386
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,156
- What the hell is this, Sheriff?
- Come on, lock them up.

387
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,590
You don't trust anybody, do you?

388
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,954
- What's so funny?
- Because I feel good...

389
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,918
that's what's so funny.
You don't mind if I feel good, do you?

390
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,956
No, but maybe you shouldn't.
I just might...

391
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,350
- I might sue you for false arrest.
- Go ahead and do it.

392
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,359
Meantime, go on over there
and lend a hand with that gold. Go on.

393
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,560
- I didn't break any law, Sheriff.
- No?

394
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,711
What about stealing my horse?

395
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,394
I needed that horse
to recover the gold.

396
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,756
Locking me in my own jail?

397
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,111
I wanted you behind me.

398
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,838
- Murder?
- Self-defence.

399
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,954
Raping?

400
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,835
Assault with a friendly weapon?

401
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,639
<i>Now, treat a girl tender
she'll preen like a bride</i>

402
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,112
<i>But take her for granted
and she'll come for your hide</i>

403
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:23,511
<i>She'll shoot off your head
if you leave her behind</i>

404
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,468
<i>And you'll lose your natural mind</i>

405
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,279
- Forget about it. Just forget about it.
- A man can dream, can't he?

406
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,669
A man can dream,
but there ain't no use...

407
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,228
'cause even if
they don't stretch your neck...

408
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:44,074
why, you'll probably be wearing
a number into the 20th century.

409
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,550
I got a number for you:

410
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,715
108 pounds of yellow gold
in that saddlebag.

411
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,510
- Are you suggesting that you and l...
- Oh, did I suggest?

412
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:01,394
Show me an honest sheriff
and I'll show you a man without money.

413
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,958
A man with money,
he don't touch the principal.

414
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,673
- He don't?
- No. He lives off the interest...

415
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,829
and there'll be lots of interest.

416
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,716
Maybe he'll subscribe
to a little railroad stock or...

417
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,158
cotton futures...

418
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,150
maybe some corn, tobacco,
sugar, wheat...

419
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,870
all from his ranch...

420
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,872
where he's got a fancy saloon...

421
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,310
and his own private gambling hall
for a watering hole.

422
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,430
<i>And all them sloe-eyed señoritas
just hungering.</i>

423
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,438
After my money.

424
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,313
True, John.

425
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,239
But you'll wear out
before you go broke.

426
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,788
You don't know how saddle-sore I am.

427
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,918
Goddamn mule like to killed me
while Cole was riding on you.

428
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,638
Come on over here.

429
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:28,159
<i>I'm going back,
I'm riding back to Durango</i>

430
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,235
<i>where the sun goes down at noon</i>

431
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,598
<i>Oh, girls in the West are the best</i>

432
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,511
<i>to rest with</i>

433
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,990
<i>Durango, Durango, Durango</i>

434
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,516
Cottonseed cake? You ain't got nothing
in here but cow food.

435
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,670
Just keep digging a little deeper.

436
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,510
I packed in kind of a hurry.

437
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,757
- Well, this ain't much better.
- Good enough for me.

438
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,399
It's kind of pretty out there,
 ain't it?

439
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,439
- That's what it's all about.
- Yeah.

440
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,788
Beautiful.

441
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,555
How come, at your age,
a fellow like you ain't tied down yet?

442
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,791
I was. Once.

443
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,798
What'd you do to her?

444
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,912
I don't know,
just got on separate trains, I guess.

445
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,751
That thing with Billee...

446
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,836
Of course, not being there,
I'll never really know, but...

447
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,797
what was that all about?

448
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,713
Just a hasty love affair.
Nothing got bruised but her pride.

449
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,314
You should've stayed to talk a bit.

450
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,514
I always talk about five minutes
before I run.

451
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,071
You left her upside down.

452
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,908
Don't think on it.
Think about something important like...

453
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,791
getting our gold to Mexico.

454
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,672
Need a light?

455
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,317
<i>Oh, the girls in the West are the best</i>

456
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,999

<i>Durango, Durango</i>

462
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,589
Ever been to Mexico?

463
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,114
Yeah. I had a leg over the border
once or twice.

464
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,792
Yeah, I bet you have.

465
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,876
- Always been wearing that badge?
- No.

466
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,632
We ran cows after that
 big dry-up in '73.

467
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:19,148
It was so dry that year, the bushes
was trailing the dogs around.

468
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,911
Yeah. We had some cattle...

469
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,309
till the government started taxing
public land.

470
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,437
If it ain't the drought,
the hoof-and-mouth, or blackleg...

471
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,909
it's the government
throwing a hook into everything.

472
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,353
It's some damn thing, always.

473
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,874
- You're right there. Look.
- What?

474
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,753
Hold it!

475
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,953
Get down, quick!

476
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,517
Rabbit, get their guns.

477
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,114
Check their vests and coats out good.

478
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,116
That there's only a watch.

479
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,278
- It's only a watch.
- I want it!

480
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,559
You got 50 pounds of gold
and you want a $1 watch?

481
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,239
I want it!

482
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,591
Drop them guns or I'll kill you.

483
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,233
What're you doing now?

484
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,156
What do I always do
when I cock my guns?

485
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,756
You're going to shoot everybody.

486
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,469
That's murder. They might send us back
from Mexico for that.

487
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,000
- He knows everything, that shoemaker.
- What do we care?

488
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,550
We'll be swapping tequilas with Ortiz
at the Presidential Palace.

489
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,514
He killed Quinlen.

490
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,955
You should thank him.
You get a bigger cut.

491
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,554
Now you see how everything works out?

492
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,992
Not that it matters,
but how did you know about Quinlen?

493
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,829
Got time for a long story, Sergeant?

494
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,876
No. Cuff them.

495
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,191
Cuff them, shoemaker. Come on!

496
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,280
- Where is the key?
- It's in the hatband.

497
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,512
- On their ankles.
- On their ankles, shoemaker!

498
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,079
I'll get the gold.

499
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,435
- We'll divvy it.
- Why not?

500
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,632
Turn around, close. Come on!

501
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,273
- Hilb! Tie their hands with this.
- Right.

502
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,959
<i>Sweet yellow, sweet yellow</i>

503
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,952
<i>Sweet tangerine gold</i>

504
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:35,631
<i>You make a man fever
You make a man bold</i>

505
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,073
<i>You're warm like a woman</i>

506
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,958
<i>a treasure to hold</i>

507
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,398
<i>Sweet yellow, sweet tangerine gold</i>

508
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,558
It kind of makes your tongue coat up,
don't it?

509
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,430
Yours is still on the horse.

510
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,752
- What's that?
- My old outfit.

511
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,989
Bye, now.

512
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,279
Our gold?

513
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,917
Shoemaker, get the mule.

514
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,910
We're through with him, ain't we?

515
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,116
Now you think a minute.

516
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,717
We let him go in Mexico.

517
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,119
- Right.
- Right.

518
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,230
As we say in the Cavalry:
Without a horse, a man's afoot.

519
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,199
<i>You make a man fever</i>

520
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,669
<i>You make a man bold</i>

521
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,832
<i>Sweet yellow, sweet tangerine gold</i>

522
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,590
And there was this $20 bill
with a bunch of doodling on it.

523
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,716
I didn't know what it was...

524
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,908
until old Quinlen made it important by
not letting me go without a shootout.

525
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,673
Yeah, so you went
and sneaked off a shot at him.

526
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,150
Never would've met you if I hadn't.
Let's try to get our legs up.

527
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,633
You ran out of town
and let yourself get accused of murder.

528
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,278
What'd you do that for?

529
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,590
I don't know. I guess I was...

530
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,279
I was just in a hurry to see what
this man was so willing to die over.

531
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,393
Let's get up.

532
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,278
The way it will work out,
you're gonna be a hero, I suppose...

533
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,715
and I'm gonna be the town jackass.

534
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,712
Don't worry,
we'll figure out a story for you.

535
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,079
Will you get your damn finger out from
under there so I can get under the knot?

536
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,037
- How's that?
- No.

537
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,312
What're you doing?

538
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,596
- Billee!
- Hello, there.

539
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,351
Well, now, look at that.

540
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,635
That's something
you don't see every day.

541
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,471
Two big men, way out in the middle
of the desert playing grapple-finger.

542
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,994
Hey, you cut out that smart talk
and get over here and cut us loose!

543
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,755
Maybe.

544
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:23,235
You get over here and cut us loose now!
That's an order!

545
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,151
What do you mean by...

546
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,238
And this one's for you.

547
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,958
True love was never rosy.

548
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,316
I wish you hadn't done that.

549
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,470
I hope that makes you feel better.

550
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,950
You get over here
and you cut us loose now.

551
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,837
Look, where you going?

552
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,992
To find me some Indians
or some red fire ants!

553
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,435
Now watch your words.
She's a woman, she might do it.

554
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,909
You're the kid with all the words.
What do I tell her?

555
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,070
- Tell her she's pretty.
- You're pretty, Billee!

556
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,229
You got to be honest, John.

557
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,390
I'm being honest. Now, Billee, really!

558
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,631
You're very good-looking up there
when you're mad that way!

559
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,553
Now, Billee, listen to me.
Now listen, see reason.

560
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,950
Billee, now, I promise you this man,
but I gotta have him first!

561
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,510
Now you see that, don't you? It's a
point of honour, it's my bounden duty!

562
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,749
Listen to me!

563
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,115
Now I know I'm a fool and a sinner,
but I...

564
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,954
It's only your old dad here
you'd be turning loose if you did it.

565
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,550
She's coming, John. You did good.

566
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:32,150
That's fine, Billee. That's my girl.

567
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,676
Now, Cole, have you got
a knife somewhere?

568
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,069
I have. In my pocket, right there.

569
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:42,989
Deeper.

570
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,438
- Now...
- No, I'm not uncut yet.

571
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,589
Give me the knife, Billee.
Here now, just hold onto that gun.

572
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,189
There.

573
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,034
Go ahead, it was worth it.

574
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,116
What's your name, anyway?

575
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,557
Quit fooling around.
Here, give me that gun. Take this.

576
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,551
His name is Lewton Cole.

577
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,237
I thought you knew him.

578
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:35,235
- No, John.
- All right, it's your gun, you do it.

579
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,949
Now don't jerk them reins around
that way...

580
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,998
you'll give that horse a leather mouth.
Now bring him over here.

581
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,640
Come on now, Billee.
Get down off there.

582
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,756
You're not the only one
who'll ride that horse.

583
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,193
Now come on, get off.

584
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:59,395
- Come on down.
- Hey, put me down!

585
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,074
All right, now you just hold on
there a minute.

586
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,910
Get Billee up behind the cantle here.

587
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,117
- Daddy!
- There.

588
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,237
All right, you up behind, Lewt. 
Come on. Up behind there.

589
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,392
All right, I'll try to keep
the animal headed straight.

590
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,429
Where we going, John?

591
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,829
Integrity guards the pass to Mexico,
don't it?

592
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,798
Our best chance is
if they lay over in Integrity.

593
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,189
But what about my rape?

594
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,635
Forget about it. We're after gold.

595
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,516
Billee, this desert at night
really does something to me.

596
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,432
- I should've shot you back there.
- You never would've shot me.

597
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,476
Right in that deep pocket.

598
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,839
What'd you want me to do, anyway,
bring you candies and flowers first?

599
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,514
No, I wanted you to do
 the decent thing.

600
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,113
Which is what?

601
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,310
If you don't know,
what's the use of talking?

602
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,517
- What does that mean?
- Think about it.

603
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,632
Oh, no, we don't want
to start thinking about it.

604
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,871
That takes us too far away
from the point of it all.

605
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,397
- What's that mean?
- Think about it.

606
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,748
<i>Well she thought and he thought</i>

607
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,910
<i>And like it or not</i>

608
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,316
<i>the colder she acted</i>

609
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,834
<i>the warmer he got</i>

610
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,353
Has anybody ever said anything
about your style?

611
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,837
Ain't that awful?

612
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,309
That's your fault, Cole.
If you hadn't been doing...

613
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,709
what you ought not to,
this never would've happened.

614
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,951
Come on, Billee, get out from under him
and let's get going.

615
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,391
The shoemaker goes with me.

616
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,599
You stay here tonight
to protect our flank.

617
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,114
From what?

618
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,359
Now, how do I know?

619
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,398
But I'm not taking any chances,
too many people know about this.

620
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,038
What are we stopping for?

621
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,908
I want to know what's ahead,
and I know the place to find out.

622
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,037
You pick us up at the Mawson Hotel
at 5:00 a.m.

623
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,359
I ain't got no watch.

624
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,512
The first light, then.

625
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,793
And no guns.

626
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,755
- Henry.
- Hey, Lavinia.

627
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,594
- I haven't seen you in quite a while.
- I've been busy.

628
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,433
I can imagine.
I only know what I read in newspapers.

629
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:41,478
- Who's been around?
- Nobody that would interest you.

630
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,869
Looks like you robbed the Army.

631
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,598
- Do I have the house for the night?
- Your credit seems good.

632
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,875
It looks kind of bare in here tonight,
doesn't it?

633
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:56,349
The town council's out
on a gallop with the Sheriff.

634
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,271
- What sheriff?
- Sheriff Copperud.

635
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,112
It has nothing to do with you, honey.

636
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,760
He's out chasing a man
who locked him in his own jail.

637
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,149
And in a very unusual condition.

638
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,672
All right, girls...

639
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,029
present arms!

640
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,631
Damn! What happened?

641
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,711
It's that damn cheap saddle of yours.

642
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,917
All right, come on, pick her up, Cole.
The action's getting away!

643
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,558
Get the hell off my lawn!

644
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,073
Hey, put me down!

645
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,200
There's old Blue tied up by the hotel.

646
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,713
Put me down!

647
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,473
Put her down, or she'll wake up
the whole neighbourhood.

648
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,676
You'll have to tell me
why you named her Billee.

649
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,876
Her ma and me
was trying to make a boy.

650
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,030
Well, you didn't even come close.

651
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,031
We came out ahead, anyway.

652
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:36,038
- Who's riding that big black horse?
- I never watch horses.

653
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,998
- Billee, Constable.
- Seen any sign of my deputy, Tippin?

654
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,672
Tippin is with you and the posse.

655
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,718
That ain't funny, George. Now, who's
Smith and Wesson down here?

656
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,791
Smith's a big fellow.
Wesson's a little one.

657
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,077
They're in 301 upstairs.
Give me the key to 301. Come on.

658
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,348
- All right, now let me have your guns.
- Guns?

659
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,598
Yeah, bang, bang.

660
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,357
I've got one of the two Colts
taken off John Wesley Hardin...

661
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,271
by Cons. John Selman...

662
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,920
after he shot Hardin
behind the right ear...

663
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,833
in the Acme Saloon in El Paso
on a Monday afternoon.

664
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,069
Come on.

665
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,875
This.32 calibre
rimfire Hopkins and Allen...

666
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,996
was almost smuggled in
to Bill Longley...

667
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,640
before they hanged him high,
October 11, 1878...

668
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,517
at Giddings, Lee County, Texas.

669
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,192
- Does it shoot?
- Beautifully.

670
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,636
Thanks very much, George. I'll try
to return it in the same condition.

671
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,756
Get out of the way there, Billee.

672
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,871
- Daddy!
- You stay down here.

673
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:40,551
<i>When a showdown's a-coming</i>

674
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:45,878
<i>When a shootout is due</i>

675
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,998
- I forgot to tell him.
- What?

676
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:51,789
The big and little one checked in,
stayed enough to spruce up, then left.

677
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,393
Where'd they go?

678
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,352
You know...

679
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,314
- Lavinia's.
- Did I mention the scary one?

680
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:08,035
<i>Face up to the danger</i>

681
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,196
<i>Throw a slug in a stranger</i>

682
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:17,558
<i>Before he throws one into you</i>

683
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,840
If they're in there,
they're not going anywhere.

684
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,115
If they are in there,
they've gotta come out.

685
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,792
They're not here.

686
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:43,032
The big one and the little one
are at your old watering hole.

687
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,680
Lavinia's. Except for the scary one.

688
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,435
And George saw him come up here,
but he didn't see him go out.

689
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,831
He's gotta be in there still.

690
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,319
What's this Lavinia's?

691
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,870
- It's just a local...
 It's kind of a club.  - Oh, yeah.

692
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,749
How come George told you
and didn't tell me?

693
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,512
You were in a hurry.

694
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,832
Billee, go down and ask George
for the key to 302.

695
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,708
You go down and ask George
for the key to 302.

696
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,997
Go on down there like you're told
and get that there key.

697
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,714
She sure moves fine though.

698
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,989
- Look.
- Damn it!

699
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,834
How did you and that Army-hating
sergeant get mixed up together?

700
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,030
You would not believe it.

701
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:45,633
They used my shoe shop
to tunnel into the Army warehouse...

702
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,718
and then they kept me as a hostage.

703
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,712
You're a real innocent.

704
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,950
I am getting ideas.

705
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,469
- Don't get reckless, Robert.
- Ben.

706
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,075
Ben. Lavinia.

707
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,029
There's hell of a draft
through that keyhole.

708
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,190
It's giving me a terrible pain
in the eyeball.

709
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,633
- Use your other eye.
- Yeah.

710
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,632
Billee, get your daddy
that chair over there, come on.

711
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:24,155
- Yeah, thank you very much, Lewton.
- You're welcome, John.

712
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,154
- What'd you tell my daddy?
- About what?

713
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,674
You know.

714
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,714
Oh, that. Well, I told him the truth.

715
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,279
You didn't.

716
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:43,710
I did. Go over and ask him.

717
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,873
Go on. Ask him.

718
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,916
Daddy, I want to tell you
what really happened.

719
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,558
Not now.

720
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:02,314
Yes, now!

721
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:06,277
Daddy, don't you care?
Doesn't it mean anything?

722
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,671
You reckon he's still in there?

723
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,598
Well, he's not out here.

724
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,391
What have you done to us?

725
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:22,230
- I believed your eyes, not your words.
- Quiet.

726
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,392
All right, if nobody cares, I don't.

727
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,273
Not now, Cole.

728
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,359
- Ben.
- Yes?

729
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:16,955
I've got an irresistible urge to tell you
how a nice girl like me got into all this.

730
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,437
If it would make you feel better
to talk about it.

731
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,708
This ain't doing no good.
Come on, let's take him.

732
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:35,109
- Go ahead.  - I mean it.
 I'm running out of patience.

733
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,270
You gotta have some first.

734
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,917
Why don't we just wait until we get them
all in one bunch, then make our play?

735
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,073
Maybe you better tell me about that
saloon and living off the interest again.

736
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,829
No time for dreaming now. Besides...

737
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,230
you've got to grow your own dreams.

738
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,871
If you're thinking about giving me
some kind of second card deal...

739
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,871
- Oh, John...
- I wish you wouldn't.

740
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,556
I'm not dealing this hand.

741
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,509
Who is?

742
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:29,314
When we find that out, we'll know
how to play the game, won't we?

743
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:36,038
Better stick your eye back
into that keyhole before that...

744
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:38,839
thing in the next room
sneaks off from us.

745
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:46,510
<i>You gotta do unto others</i>

746
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,190
<i>Do unto others</i>

747
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:53,034
<i>before they do it unto you</i>

748
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,789
Hold these for me, will you?

749
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,313
Fifi La Flame.

750
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,158
Cole!

751
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,631
Watch yourself, mister!

752
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,032
Why didn't you stop him?

753
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,156
- You got my gun.
- I know it.

754
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,313
My gold! They're gonna get my gold!

755
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,913
How do you feel?

756
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:57,668
Reckless!

757
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,468
A man can't even get
a good night's sleep.

758
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:09,275
Hilb!

759
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:13,273
My gold! They're gonna get my gold.

760
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,989
Well, that's it. I got mine.

761
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,874
That's good,
now you can help me get mine.

762
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,349
- Good luck, Cole.
- John.

763
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,554
Hell, this hand isn't over yet, is it?

764
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,518
All right, now listen...

765
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:29,475
there's a front door that way,
back door that way, and some windows.

766
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,517
I've always been rather partial
to front doors myself.

767
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,119
All right.

768
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,548
Go ahead.

769
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,077
No, you don't! That can't be replaced.

770
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:57,438
I hope you realize you have
to buy the rest of this furniture!

771
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,954
Listen, I've always picked up
my own broken glass.

772
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:03,749
I didn't think you'd want to put me out
of business, you put so much into it!

773
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,229
That's right, I'm almost a partner.

774
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,868
Listen, you gotta
talk the Sheriff out of this.

775
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:13,272
I can always talk him into things, but I
don't know if I can talk him out of things.

776
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:21,833
You're almost as anxious
as the first time you came in here!

777
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,753
Don't interrupt me now, Lavinia,
I'm on a case.

778
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:44,992
- Soliciting for the Orphans' Fund again?
- You just stay out of the way.

779
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:49,513
We've got a real live bear in there.
I've just got to smoke him out.

780
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,320
You take yourself awful serious.

781
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,913
People elect serious men
to sheriff for them.

782
01:13:57,240 --> 01:14:00,516
You've got my vote, my money,
and, I thought, my friendship!

783
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,877
What the hell does that mean?

784
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,429
You're about to shoot up
our meal ticket!

785
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,835
It's official business.

786
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,117
I'll get the town council
to pay for any refurbishments.

787
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,476
You're an honest man.

788
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,030
That vase was brought around the Horn!

789
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:39,069
This is a home, not just a house,
you bastards!

790
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,558
Hey, wait a minute!

791
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,231
Let's talk a spell, shall we?

792
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:57,835
Right!

793
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,756
- What do you want to talk about?
- Talk about that there gold.

794
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,751
What's your proposition?

795
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,799
Your life for that gold is
 the proposition.

796
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,068
- Well?
- Well, I'm thinking about it.

797
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,440
You know how hard I had to work
for that gold?

798
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,392
Ain't that terrible, Cole?

799
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:26,155
Why, in another minute,
he'd have us believing he earned it.

800
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,634
John!

801
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,073
Come on out front!

802
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,513
- Where's that thief?
- Behind that water trough out there.

803
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,431
Let's blow the damn thing up.

804
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,517
Now wait a minute.
Now we ain't doing no good here.

805
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:29,870
One of us has to go around the back
and flush him the hell out of there.

806
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:34,078
The other will stay and pick him off.
Somebody's gotta do that, too.

807
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,068
Somebody?

808
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,595
Would you feel better
if I went around back...

809
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:45,831
and flushed him out and
you stayed out here and picked him off?

810
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,639
- Yeah, thanks very much.
- Yeah, all right.

811
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:51,390
- I'll pick him off.
- Do that.

812
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:02,270
<i>While Ben was playing steal the gold
and make your getaway</i>

813
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:09,150
<i>The other three played shoot-'em-up
and turn about's fair play</i>

814
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:15,517
<i>But Ben had tasted painted lips
and heard the siren's song</i>

815
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:21,429
<i>So he could hardly keep
from going wrong</i>

816
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:26,875
<i>It's the code of the West
Heed the word of your sisters</i>

817
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:33,790
<i>The code of the West
Make a left turn from sin</i>

818
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:40,231
<i>The code of the West
Keep an eye on temptation</i>

819
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:44,319
<i>Recite the quotation that says
when Satan calls your name</i>

820
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,995
<i>It doesn't matter how you played
the game 'cause all he cares about</i>

821
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,150
<i>is did you win</i>

822
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,792
Where is he, John?

823
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,270
Behind that there trough.

824
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,318
No, he's not. Where'd he go?

825
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,431
Sergeant, get out of there.

826
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:24,511
- Lf you'll just give me...
- Shut up.

827
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,511
Be quiet, Sergeant.

828
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:28,272
Where's that gold?

829
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:47,192
<i>Now Cole and John and Henry J.
Were feeling mighty sad</i>

830
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,797
Oh, Blue! He'd let anybody ride him.

831
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,873
<i>To think a little sack of gold
could turn a good man bad</i>

832
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:02,676
<i>But when you pit the meek and mild
against the brave and bold</i>

833
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:05,911
<i>The meek inherit all the Army's gold</i>

834
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:10,073
Wait for me!

835
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:15,273
<i>Now in the meantime, Billee girl
was scheming on her own</i>

836
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:23,072
<i>She knew a healthy, sweet young thing
can't live by bread alone</i>

837
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:30,518
<i>To play the tricky game of life
a woman needs a plan</i>

838
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:34,195
<i>To play the game of love
she needs a man</i>

839
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:54,949
There, sir.

840
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,230
Well, what have we here?

841
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:05,198
- Cpl. Blyth.
- Sir.

842
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:11,509
Put Sgt. Foggers, Henry J.,
U.S. Cav., under arrest immediately.

843
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,559
He was supposed to be guarding
the Army's gold.

844
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,835
Sgt. Foggers, Henry J., reporting, sir.

845
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,434
He took me as a hostage
until I got the best of him.

846
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,351
The foreign shoemaker, sir.

847
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,992
- This is just not...
- He did?

848
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,389
Well, it fits. It was his tunnel.

849
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:36,749
Sgt. Foggers, if this is true,
the Army has lost a deserter...

850
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,473
and gained a hero.

851
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,438
- Cpl. Blyth!
- Sir!

852
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:45,355
Arrest Lewton Cole
for the murder of Doc Quinlen.

853
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,477
Captain, sir.

854
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,319
Self-defence.

855
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:53,915
You see, Doc Quinlen found out
that I found out...

856
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,549
that shoemaker and him
was planning that whole gold robbery.

857
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:00,269
I see.

858
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:04,357
I was forced to do it
in order to save the Army's gold.

859
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:07,352
Mr. Cole, if what you say is true,
you're in for a nice reward.

860
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,237
Thank you, Captain.

861
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,799
Honest John...

862
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,717
did all this transpire as my sergeant
and Mr. Cole relate?

863
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,199
Yes, Captain.

864
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:20,353
You might say these men were acting
as my deputies in recovering the gold.

865
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:24,553
No reward for us professionals,
eh, John?

866
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:28,272
Of course you'll get your recognition
come election time.

867
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,471
- Cpl. Blyth!
- Sir.

868
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,993
Arrest the foreigner.

869
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,950
But I am innocent.

870
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,875
I am the only innocent.

871
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:42,992
- They all say that, eh, John?
- Yeah, it's shocking.

872
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:45,676
I was the hostage! L...

873
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,876
Ain't that terrible, Captain?

874
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:52,796
It is hopeless.

875
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:54,789
Hopeless?

876
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:58,518
You're asking me
to doubt appearances?

877
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:03,230
The Army, the law, and professional...

878
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,509
enterprise.

879
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:07,953
- Cpl. Blyth!
- Sir.

880
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:10,759
Haul him away.
Careful, he's a dangerous man.

881
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:16,631
No man hauls Ben Agajanian.

882
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:20,197
I walk free, alone, thank you.

883
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:21,679
First squad.

884
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,194
Foggers!

885
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,753
Henry J., where's the Army's gold?

886
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,349
It's in the saddlebag, sir.

887
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:06,597
Get that shoemaker back here!

888
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:08,511
Get that shoemaker back here!

889
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:15,036
What a pleasure
to see you here, Miss Billee.

890
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,678
Arrest that man.

891
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:21,709
No. It turns out
it was a case of self-defence.

892
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,518
I don't care about that.

893
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:27,275
He forced his affections on me.

894
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:40,189
There's not a court
in the land who would convict...

895
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:42,396
with a ravishing beauty like you
for a witness.

896
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:46,234
And who in the jury wouldn't do
the same thing if given the chance?

897
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,713
Mr. Ben Agajanian...

898
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:55,509
it's my duty to warn you that anything
you say will be held against you. Now...

899
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,397
where's the Army's gold?

900
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:00,035
He must've dropped it
between here and Integrity.

901
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:02,270
He must've dropped it
between here and Integrity.

902
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:04,669
Sgt. Foggers,
take command of your squad.

903
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:05,829
- Cpl. Blyth!
- Sir.

904
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,194
Mount up the men.

905
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:09,914
You must excuse me.
I've got to move the men out.

906
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,276
Now wait a minute.
Where are you going?

907
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,590
I just thought I'd go get
a little drink of water.

908
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:19,069
Yeah, well, I'm just as thirsty
as you are.

909
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:34,114
Ben?

910
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,233
Do you trust me?

911
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:51,075
<i>Now Lewton Cole knew
Billee had some mighty fetching ways</i>

912
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:58,950
<i>Old Ben would tell her everything
and still get 90 days</i>

913
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:09,912
<i>Beneath a rock beside the trail</i>

914
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:13,318
<i>that leads to Mexico</i>

915
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:19,950
<i>You'll find yourself 100 pounds or so</i>

916
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:27,831
<i>It's the code of the West</i>

917
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:31,595
<i>Every girl needs a dowry</i>

918
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,518
Now I've got you, Lewton Cole.

919
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:37,114
<i>The code of the West</i>

920
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:41,992
<i>And it don't matter whose</i>

921
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:47,478
<i>The code of the West</i>

922

<i>She's gotta give plenty</i>

924
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:01,875
<i>to end up with rice in her shoes</i>

925
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:09,790
Hello, there, Billee, honey.

926
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,314
You!

927
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,431
What are you doing here?

928
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,476
Why, I've just come looking after you.

929
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:21,439
You're after the gold.

930
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,317
That, too, but...

931
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,672
what about partners?

932
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,078
What kind of partners?

933
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:34,034
What kind of partners
do you have in mind?

934
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,234
Full-time.

935
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,277
You take me like I am?

936
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:46,516
Lavinia, I thought
you would never get here.

937
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:12,475
<i>Well, Cole had a few other things
left to do</i>

938
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:17,358
<i>He flowered his Stetson</i>

939
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,954
<i>and boarded old Blue</i>

940
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:23,112
Hey! Wait a minute. Where you going?

941
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,034
Durango.

942
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:32,073
That's the way I am. Bye-bye.

943
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:36,272
<i>The rougher you treat them</i>

944
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:39,238
<i>the stronger they grieve</i>

945
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:40,799
You!

946
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:46,271
<i>And the longer they watch</i>

947
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:50,069
<i>when you leave</i>

948
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,914
- Where you going?
- Where you heading?

949
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:58,271
Where the hell is Cole?

950
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:00,796
- I thought he was with you.
- No, he...

951
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:11,792
Hey, shoemaker, you going to tell us
where the gold is?

952
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:16,635
Now, just what's that thing for?

953
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:18,799
Go and get it, Ben.

954
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:29,514
- Where is the Army's gold?
- The shoemaker knows where it is, sir.

955
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:32,669
Where did you put it, Miss Billee?

956
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:44,075
There he is. That's Lewton Cole!

957
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:02,918
<i>Old Mexico is just ahead
So, gambler, move along</i>

958
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:09,995
Maybe we take gold too seriously.

959
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:16,352
<i>There ain't nobody there to care
if you did right or wrong</i>

960
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,950
We don't take gold seriously enough.

961
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,914
<i>You shot a thief, you found some gold</i>

962
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,752
<i>You stole a kiss or two</i>

963
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:30,589
<i>And the world's a better place
because of you</i>

964
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:37,711
<i>The code of the West
When you're drinking tequila</i>

965
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:44,556
<i>The code of the West
Toast the red, white, and blue</i>

966
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:50,912
<i>The code of the West
Be good to your neighbours</i>

967
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:55,750
<i>Your new northern neighbours
Remember they were awful good to you</i>

968
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:03,110
<i>That's the code of the West</i>

969
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,391
<i>That's the code of the West</i>
