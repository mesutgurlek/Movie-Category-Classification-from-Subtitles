1
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,880
Are they wild horses, Dad?

2
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,480
No, they’re not brumbies.

3
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,400
Someone’s gone to a lot of trouble
to put that mob together

4
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,200
You won’t find better anywhere.

5
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,360
It’s the man himself. Jim Craig.

6
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,480
From Snowy River?
That’s Him.

7
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,240
A long way from home.

8
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,840
BOY: I’ll look after him.

9
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,720
JIM: Thanks, son.

10
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,400
You’re cracking on the pace, Jim.
You going back for good?

11
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,080
Yep.
I’ve been away long enough.

12
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,720
Yeah. I suppose so.

13
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,080
But still, you’ll be missed
in these parts, Jim.

14
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,760
Thanks, mate.

15
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,560
Well ...
... I’ve got my stake together now.

16
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,920
Not a bad one, either.

17
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,800
They’re the best I’ve seen.

18
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,560
For thousands of miles.

19
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,320
You going to breed them?

20
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,240
Mmm. Eventually.

21
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,000
See, before I left home,

22
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,120
I let that old wild stallion
and his mob loose again.

23
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,160
And now I’m going to let him
cover these mares.

24
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,680
Big plans.

25
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,000
Spare me that, mate.

26
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,560
Was it Denny that ran down
that stallion, Mr Craig?

27
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,720
Jim.

28
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,920
Yep. That’s him, alright.

29
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,120
About due for a rest, I reckon.

30
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,240
Remember old, um ... Harrison?
He had a daughter, didn’t he?

31
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,640
Jessica.
Right. Right.

32
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,360
Well, I suppose
that’s as good a reason as any

33
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,960
for going home in a hurry.

34
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,000
JIM: What are you after, Seb?

35
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,400
Rabbits? Or something bigger?

36
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,080
Depends.

37
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,680
I thought I’d come up
and see if the place was alright.

38
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,560
Thanks.

39
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,920
Why the rifle?

40
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,360
Insurance.

41
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,080
A few funny things
have been happening up here lately.

42
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,200
Like what?
Cattle and horses spooked.

43
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,800
They must reckon
we’ve been poddy-dodging.

44
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,960
Stealing cattle? Surely not.

45
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,040
Well, no more than usual.

46
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,960
Only as much as you can eat, anyway.

47
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,760
That’s right.
It’s traditional.

48
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,520
No, it’s more likely
some big nobs down below

49
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,040
have finally woken up
to this droughtproof grazing up here

50
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,680
and want to grab a bit.

51
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,040
They’ve been serving us with papers.

52
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,400
What, legal papers?
Oh, I don’t know.

53
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,680
Found a good use for them, though.

54
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,040
Someone took a shot
at your old stallion last week.

55
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,320
What?
He’s alright. Back with his mob.

56
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,320
Who was it?
We don’t know.

57
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,280
It could’ve been anyone
who’s blamed him

58
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,120
for every horse gone missing
over the past 20 years.

59
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,560
That’s just about everybody.

60
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,480
Yeah, well, he’s not
exactly house-trained, is he?

61
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,760
Anyway, now you’re back
for a while ...

62
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,200
Back for good, Seb.

63
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,520
Just one more thing to do.

64
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,960
Hope things go the way
you want them to down there, mate.

65
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,240
Mmm.

66
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,320
Well, let’s get a fire going.

67
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,400
It’s good to have you home!

68
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,280
Jessica!

69
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,440
Mr Simmons tells me
you’ve been riding that colt again.

70
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,800
Now, I employ a jockey to do that.

71
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,240
I know.

72
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,320
But ... I get the faster times.

73
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,960
Is that true?

74
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,560
Where is this great jockey
you begged me to hire, Simmons?

75
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,000
He’s off trying to lose some weight,
Mr Harrison.

76
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,120
I see - he gets fat off my beef,

77
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,640
then I have to pay him while
he tries to lighten his carcass.

78
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,080
Now, listen to me, Simmons.

79
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,000
I want that colt flying
by this weekend.

80
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,880
Do you understand?  Flying!

81
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,080
These are my home grounds.
I intend to win that race!

82
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,880
That’s all.

83
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,640
Get that jockey into condition.

84
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,520
Lousy weather.

85
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,800
Old and cold, Jess.

86
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,040
Old and cold.

87
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,240
I want you to change into something
more feminine before lunch.

88
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,480
We have guests.
Oh? Who?

89
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,920
Patton.

90
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,240
Oh, Mr Patton.
I should have guessed that.

91
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,080
I mean, percentages and
balance sheets and interest rates

92
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,920
make such fascinating conversation.

93
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,440
Oh, his son will be there too.

94
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,640
Well, good.
Alistair should liven things up a bit.

95
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,640
And when you’re running this place,

96
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,880
you’ll be damn glad I made you sit in
on all these business meetings, lady.

97
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,320
Me?
Mmm.

98
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,440
Run the place?

99
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,480
I thought all I had to do was ...

100
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,400
... show a little bit of petticoat

101
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,320
and snare somebody eligible
so he could run it.

102
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,200
Or think he does.
Yeah, like I think I do, right?

103
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,920
Now, listen, Jess. Wear plenty of frills.

104
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,520
If we’re going to keep this place growing,
we’re going to need Mr Patton.

105
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,240
And his loans.

106
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,080
You have a rest, old mate.

107
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,680
Time to teach one of these youngsters
a thing or two, eh?

108
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,520
Well, this is a first-class turnout,
Harrison.

109
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,480
Does you credit.
Thanks ... Patton.

110
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,680
I was talking to some
of the other families just now.

111
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,360
We’re all impressed.
We must see more of you.

112
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,960
Well, I’ll drink to that.

113
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,400
I’ll get it.

114
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,520
I can get my own godda ...

115
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,160
See to Mr Patton’s glass ...

116
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,440
You know, once the bank
has decided to back you -

117
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,960
and I’m sure my directors will see
that is a mere formality -

118
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,840
great things are possible.

119
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,160
Well, I’m looking forward to it.

120
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,320
Mind you, if our ties
extended beyond ... mortgages,

121
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,520
I would say the sky’s the limit.

122
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,840
Well, it’s an interesting
proposition, Patton.

123
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,920
But of course, that’s up to Jessica.

124
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,360
Of course.

125
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,840
Oh, excuse me ...

126
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,360
Uh, Colonel Hawker?

127
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,440
Someone I’d like you to meet.

128
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,560
Harrison, Colonel Hawker, Indian Army.

129
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,640
Well, I’m pleased to meet you, Colonel.

130
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,080
How do you do?

131
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,240
Colonel Hawker
comes down from India every year

132
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,400
and faithfully buys up the best
cavalry horses in the country.

133
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,280
He means his own, of course.

134
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,880
Well, anyway, you’ll be pleased
with this year’s draft.

135
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,440
Despite the poor season,
I could still give you 500.

136
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,680
Good.
New lines coming through strongly.

137
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,120
Excuse me.

138
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,040
Here, you. Look after the gentlemen.

139
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,480
Interesting man.

140
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,600
Has he been here long?

141
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,520
20 years, more or less.

142
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,400
Don’t know a lot about him.

143
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,120
Yankee originally.
Made a bit of money on gold diggings.

144
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,760
Not exactly a first-class background!

145
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,040
Not like us, eh?

146
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,480
No, indeed.

147
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,720
I believe your family came from
the Percys on the Scottish border.

148
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,160
They most certainly did.

149
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,840
Mine were the Monmouths.
Really?

150
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,440
Yes. My lot used to hang your lot.

151
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,920
As cattle thieves.

152
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,720
This, Mr Simmons, is the problem.

153
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,320
HARRISON: Jessica.

154
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,720
You want the horse to win or not?

155
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,760
Let the jockey handle it!

156
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,240
Mr Simmons?

157
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,800
Where is our fat jockey this morning?

158
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,080
Uh ... he took some medicine,
so he had to go to the, um ...

159
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,680
He’ll be back in a minute.

160
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,720
He should stay there,
for all the bloody good he’ll do.

161
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,880
Ah. Miss Harrison.

162
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,960
Mr Patton! Hello.

163
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,040
Excuse me.

164
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,200
Charming girl.

165
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,000
Oh, she has a mind of her own.

166
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,640
The best sort, Harrison.

167
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,280
It’s the high-stepping fillies that
make the best mares, eh?

168
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,920
Harrison.

169
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,360
Father.

170
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,280
Come on, Harrison.
This is going to be worth watching.

171
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,680
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen.

172
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,400
The regimental trophy holder,
Lieutenant Patton,

173
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,440
will now demonstrate
the skill-at-arms course.

174
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,360
Yah!

175
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,480
I’m awfully sorry.

176
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,400
It’s alright. You missed.

177
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,160
I ... take it
you’re looking for the stables?

178
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,920
No. For Jessica Harrison.
Have you seen her?

179
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,520
Er ... well, yes, but ...

180
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,840
Who would be asking for her?
Oh, that was good riding out there.

181
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,600
My name’s Jim Craig.

182
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,800
Oh, the one we’ve heard so much about.

183
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,440
Could be.

184
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,960
You were a bit lucky that day, Craig.

185
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,400
Mainly old stagers there, I hear.

186
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,920
Everyone was invited.

187
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,400
You’re out of your class here, Craig.

188
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,280
HAWKER: Afternoon, Mr Patton.

189
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,720
Sir.

190
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,200
Mr Collins.
Good afternoon, sir.

191
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,640
Harry Hawker.

192
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,280
Jim Craig.

193
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,080
Uh, could you spare me a minute, Jim?

194
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,840
I noticed your horse.
I was coming over for a closer look.

195
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,440
He’s a good type. Learning quickly.

196
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,520
Just the one?

197
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,840
No, I’ve got about 100 of them.

198
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,200
Really?

199
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,880
Uh, will you excuse me, Harry?
It was good to meet you.

200
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,480
And you.

201
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,880
Where the devil is Summer Cloud?

202
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,960
Oh, already out there.

203
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,760
Bit overanxious, eh?

204
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,280
Not a good sign.
Anyway, I wouldn’t fuss about that.

205
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,640
My Highland Laddie’s obviously
got the edge on your fellow.

206
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,800
It’s easy to say, Patton.

207
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,400
I’ve got £100 to back that up, Harrison.

208
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,840
£500.

209
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,960
Done.

210
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,000
Come on!

211
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Damn it! What the hell’s
that bloody jockey doing?!

212
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,200
He’s moving.

213
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,560
He’s moving! Come on!
Come on!

214
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,560
Come on!

215
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,640
You lost.

216
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,520
Thank you.

217
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,800
Good horse, that.

218
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,000
Yeah, I know. I broke him in.

219
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,200
What the devil
do you think you’re doing

220
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,640
out there with professional jockeys?

221
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,080
You might’ve been killed!
The jockey was missing.

222
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,480
Oh, and you just happened
to be available? It’s ...

223
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,920
SIMMONS!

224
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,560
Simmons, where is that bloody jockey?

225
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,240
He’s here, Mr Harrison.

226
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,440
S-somebody locked me in the outhouse!

227
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,040
Simmons ...

228
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,680
You’re sacked.

229
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,680
You’re both sacked.

230
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,120
SIMMONS: Suits me.

231
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,560
Working for you two’s like
being caught in a meat grinder!

232
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,600
Now, I want you
to go in the house and change.

233
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,040
Right now.

234
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,000
Jess?

235
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
Congratulations.

236
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,960
Thanks.

237
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,880
Hello, Jess.

238
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,720
Well, Craig. Been a long time.

239
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,800
G’day, Mr Harrison.

240
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,840
I don’t recall having invited you today.

241
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,920
No, I came to see Jessica.

242
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,920
Perhaps I could come back tomorrow.

243
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,560
Well, you’re not welcome here, Craig.

244
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,720
Today, tomorrow ...

245
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,720
... any time.

246
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,520
Oh.

247
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,320
I’m sorry to hear that.

248
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,000
Tell me, do you still speak
for Jessica too?

249
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,720
I don’t argue with drifters.

250
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,640
Father ... please.

251
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,840
Come with me, Jess.

252
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,600
Jess, I ...

253
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,240
... I know it’s been a long time,

254
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,400
but I’ve got a start for us.

255
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,600
Have you been thinking of me, then?

256
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,680
That’s good.

257
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,120
HARRISON: Jess!

258
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,560
Jessica!

259
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,880
I know you hicks
are slow on the uptake, Craig,

260
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,400
but you’re setting a record.

261
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,960
I don’t know who you think you are,

262
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,480
but you’re not part of this,
so keep your mouth shut.

263
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,800
You’ve been away too long, Craig.

264
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,000
You don’t know who’s part of what.

265
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,600
Change your clothes, Jess.

266
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,120
Get off this property.

267
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,040
Now.

268
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,320
There are better ways
to make your point, Jim.

269
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,360
Ya!

270
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,640
Get up!

271
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,560
I think you’d call that a live prisoner.

272
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,000
It was more than just a loutish display.

273
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,640
It was open contempt for the values
on which this community is based.

274
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,080
Perhaps now you’ll understand

275
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,920
why we must get rid
of that riffraff up there

276
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,360
and acquire the mountain grazing
areas for the benefit of the valley.

277
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,040
It’s easier said than done.

278
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,480
Don’t be too sure.

279
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,400
I aim to have a bill before the House
this session. I’m sure I have your support.

280
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,480
What you’re saying is I support you
or I have problems with the bank.

281
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,920
Is that right, Patton?

282
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,320
Well ... a fraction bold, old man,

283
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,160
but ... I see you get the general drift.

284
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,920
Oh, blimey!
You’re enough to make a saint swear.

285
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,360
No saints around here, Father.

286
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,640
Otherwise, you could do the loaves
and fishes thing with pound notes

287
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,520
and give me something decent to use!

288
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,440
You miserable sinners.

289
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,440
When this is finished
and any of you come to confession,

290
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,520
you’ll be laughing
on the other side of your faces.

291
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,520
When that’s finished,
we’ll be too old to commit sins.

292
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,800
Now, I’ll give you all a fair choice.

293
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,000
Either get on about your business

294
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,480
or contribute to God’s work
with your labour or your cash.

295
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,640
Oh. You must be new around here.

296
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,120
Been away for a while.

297
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,080
But there used to be
only a small mine here.

298
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,680
Yes.

299
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,880
Yes, an old fellow named Spur
grubbed most of his life away here.

300
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:52,680
And after he died, they found it -
50ft from his shaft.

301
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,440
Found what?
The mother lode. 1,000ft down.

302
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,400
Pity they don’t dig as deep
into their pockets.

303
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,800
Jim!

304
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,200
G’day, Seb.
Where the hell have you been?

305
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,520
I’ve been looking for you.
Come have a beer.

306
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,040
SEB: G’day, Mrs Darcy.

307
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,840
Hello, Sebastian.

308
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,840
This is Jim Craig.

309
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,800
Hello, Jim.
Hello.

310
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,680
So it didn’t go too well down there?

311
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,040
I didn’t think
they’d put out the red carpet.

312
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,200
With old Harrison,
it was more like a red rag to a bull.

313
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,960
Well, we all know
they’d like to run us

314
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,640
right out of the High Country.

315
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,080
Mmm.

316
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,320
What are the boys doing about that?

317
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,160
Nothing.

318
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,800
They reckon if you don’t
stir the possum, it won’t bite you.

319
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,280
What CAN we do?

320
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,200
I’m glad to hear
you’re playing the piano again.

321
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,640
It’s been too long.

322
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,640
Do you think, maybe,
you could play some other tune?

323
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,480
It’s not a tune. It’s a sonata.

324
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,720
Well, whatever the hell it is!

325
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,480
You’re pining away over that drifter
Craig. You’re just wasting your time.

326
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,160
Jim ISN’T a drifter.
What else would you call him?

327
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,240
The man disappears into the mountains
for months at a time.

328
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,640
No-one ever sees him
or hears from him.

329
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,520
Whatever he is,
he won’t be back here, Jess.

330
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,160
Now, I thought you accepted that.

331
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,760
You haven’t been
outside this house in days.

332
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,240
Everyone’s been asking for you.
Oh!

333
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,880
I thought this is where you wanted me.

334
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,200
Looking decorative,
waiting for the suitors to call.

335
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,120
One HAS called.

336
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,960
Alistair Patton.

337
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,880
Called every other day,
and I’m running out of excuses.

338
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,560
Then don’t make excuses.
Tell him I won’t see him.

339
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,120
That’s fine with me. Either way.

340
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,000
How you both treated Jim
was disgraceful.

341
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,760
The subject is closed! Now, I am sick
to death of hearing about Jim Craig.

342
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,000
Well, I am not

343
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,000
Craig doesn’t belong here.
He could NEVER belong here. You do.

344
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,160
Oh. And so does Alistair Patton,
I suppose?

345
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,120
Affections are all related
to houses and property, are they not?

346
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,000
God, you can be so aggravating!
Obviously a chip off the old block!

347
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,880
Because I don’t care a hoot in hell
about the Pattons, junior or senior!

348
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,040
And you know it!
Well, neither do I!

349
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,600
Then what the hell
are we arguing about?!

350
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,200
MRS DARCY: Jim?

351
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,000
JIM: Morning.
Are you leaving today?

352
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,000
No. Not Yet.

353
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,560
I want to check into the affairs
of an old friend.

354
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,520
Spur?

355
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,000
You know, I bet he’s still
smiling away to himself up there.

356
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,440
How’s that?

357
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,240
He willed this place
to all the battlers and fossickers

358
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,320
that have ever
grubbed around these hills.

359
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,360
That’s not playing the game by the rules.

360
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,800
Gets worse.

361
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,440
You see, none of these people
work for bosses.

362
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,760
And that’s something
the landed gentry can’t digest.

363
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,000
Well ... long live Eureka Creek.

364
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,400
Excuse me.

365
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,120
I came to talk to you.

366
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,720
Couldn’t believe it
when I saw you again.

367
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,280
It was like an illusion.

368
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,600
I want to know why you were away
for so long, Jim.

369
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,320
I told you. To get a start for us.

370
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,360
Why is accumulating things
so damned important?

371
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,200
Because I’ve seen the lack of it.
And I don’t want that for you.

372
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,080
Things change.

373
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,920
Is there someone else?

374
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,680
They’ve all made plans for me -
with Alistair Patton.

375
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,880
I’m not going through with it.

376
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,120
But I can’t come up here with you.

377
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,640
Why not?

378
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,160
My father.

379
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,360
He needs me now
more than he ever did before.

380
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,320
And ... the Pattons are the most
powerful family in the district.

381
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,880
If we were together,
they would break him.

382
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,840
And then they’d come after you
and everybody up here.

383
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,600
Your own people would turn against you
and I would be the cause.

384
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,960
You’re taking too much
on yourself, Jess.

385
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,240
No. I’ve given this a lot of thought.

386
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,360
It’d drive us apart, Jim.

387
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,680
JESSICA’S VOICE: ``Dear Father,
I have to go and see Jim.

388
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,160
``Please don’t be angry with me.
I must do this my own way.’’

389
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,760
Are you just going to stand there
and let her go?

390
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,360
Would you mind if I ask why?

391
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,640
For a lot of reasons.

392
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,240
Oh, really?

393
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,600
MAN: It’s better all round this way, Jim.

394
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,080
Better for whom, Jake?

395
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,400
Why not just say it straight out?
Better for your own interests.

396
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,960
Oh, and better for Harrison’s
own selfish interests too,

397
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,520
no doubt you’ve been told.

398
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,480
Oh, yes, Jim. He was always very
good at looking after number one.

399
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,840
Just leave things as they are.

400
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,000
Broaden your minds.

401
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,680
Have another beer.

402
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,120
Have two!

403
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,240
Yah! Hah! Hah!

404
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,440
Jess, I’m not going to let you go like this.

405
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,040
We’re not going to mess up our lives
doing what other people think is right.

406
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,760
Listen to me.

407
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,280
You’ve thought of me, your father,
almost everyone else.

408
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,120
Alright.

409
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,440
But what about YOU?

410
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,600
What do YOU want?

411
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,520
I want you.

412
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,640
Alright. You two can head on back.

413
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,760
Let’s go home, Jess.

414
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,080
The time’s passed for that,
Harrison. Let’s talk straight.

415
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,320
Jessica, are you coming with me or not?

416
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,640
Father, please, don’t do this.

417
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,200
Now, you can’t have it both ways.
Not this time, Jess.

418
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,120
Either come with me now ...

419
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,000
... or stay here with him.

420
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,840
Can’t you understand I love you both?

421
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,640
It’s me or him, Jess.

422
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,000
It doesn’t have to be a choice.

423
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,240
Jess?

424
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,600
I want to be with Jim.

425
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,280
Alright.

426
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,680
Alright, stay with him, then.

427
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,920
You’re just like your mother.

428
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,680
Right, Jack.

429
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,000
Having a good time, love?

430
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,520
Well, look who’s here!

431
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,320
MAN: Where’s the bloody silver spoon?

432
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,880
Well, what did Daddy give you
for Christmas this year, mate?

433
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,000
A healthy dislike for dimwits.

434
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,080
I’ll shout for the bar.

435
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,720
What do you want?

436
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,480
What have you got?

437
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,920
Everything.

438
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,880
Well, we’ll start with a rum.

439
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,000
See where we go from there.

440
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,720
I’ve missed you.
Where have you been?

441
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,640
Don’t worry about it.

442
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,160
Just concentrate on what you know best.

443
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,400
Haven’t seen you around for a while.

444
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,000
Looks like I’d better buy a drink.

445
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,360
I might have something for you
that could triple that roll.

446
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,120
I think we could count on bringing down
about 60 foals from those Walers.

447
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,200
And there are eight good
yearling fillies in the brumby mobs.

448
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,840
Harry.

449
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:56,560
HAWKER: They’re good. Very good.
Are they for sale?

450
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,240
30 or 40.
We want to keep most for breeding.

451
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,120
Look, my job is to supply large
numbers of remounts every year,

452
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,560
regardless of conditions.

453
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,000
That’s why I deal with people
like the Pattons.

454
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,040
They’re big suppliers.
They have guaranteed numbers.

455
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,600
So you’re not interested
in small lots, then?

456
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,080
Well, to put it bluntly,
it’s not worth my while.

457
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,720
As good as these are.

458
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,160
Wait a minute.

459
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,880
What if we’re not talking
about small lots?

460
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,520
How about a guaranteed 1 00 a year?

461
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:28,880
Every family up here can turn off six
horses as good as these in a year.

462
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,320
That’ll bring the numbers up.

463
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,640
Yes, but I’m looking for quality.
I want better than stock horses.

464
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,800
Well, the mountain horse
is bred for quality.

465
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,880
You won’t find better doing horses
anywhere.

466
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,920
Well, you’ll need a lot of cooperation.

467
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,680
The people up here
tend to go their own way.

468
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,120
You needn’t worry about that.

469
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,400
Jim’s very good at getting people
to see things his way.

470
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,680
Alright.

471
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,720
I’ll be back in a week.

472
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,320
If you can show me the numbers,
we’ll talk contracts.

473
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,800
Right.

474
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:09,880
Here! Hey!
Giddy-up, now. Whoa!

475
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,360
JIM: Let’s block them up here.
MAN: Hold them.

476
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,880
Righto!

477
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,320
That brown horse, Charlie.
Yeah?

478
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:21,760
And, uh ... the tall bay mare there
should do.

479
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,360
You certainly go for the best.

480
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,840
That’s what I promised him.
Hmm.

481
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,160
Drop them off at the new yards and
I’ll see you next week with a cheque.

482
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,600
Righto.

483
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,440
Altogether, that’s 74.
Great.

484
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,160
We’ll go over to Bryce’s now.

485
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:00,720
Come on, darling. If you fall asleep
there, I’ll never move you.

486
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,560
I never believed

487
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:09,080
I could feel so tired and so happy
at the same time.

488
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,520
You should take it a bit easier.

489
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:18,320
You know, all my life
I’ve been judged by who I am.

490
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,200
Up here, it’s just what I am that matters.

491
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,000
You’ve always had that.

492
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,800
You know how good it feels.

493
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,440
You’ve earned it.

494
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,400
I’ll keep earning it.

495
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,160
Not afraid of a little competition, are we?

496
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,320
He’s a slimy bastard.

497
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,280
He’s got them all
eating out of his hand up there.

498
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,280
That’s the first time
I’ve heard you pay him a compliment.

499
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,200
If you call it that, Collins.

500
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,960
Who’d want to be the leader
of the hairy unwashed?

501
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,480
It’s time we paid him a visit.
Why?

502
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,680
Let him know we’re serious.

503
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:40,400
People like that should not be allowed
to stand in the way of progress.

504
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,400
Have you spoken to your father
about this?

505
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,840
I don’t have to.

506
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,960
A nod’s as good as a wink.

507
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,560
We’re all looking for action, right?

508
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,920
MAN: Yes.

509
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,320
This is stupid and it’s wrong.

510
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,680
Worse, it’ll bounce back on you.

511
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,320
Ask him about his real motive.

512
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:09,200
Like Jessica Harrison.
MAN: Shut up, Collins.

513
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,200
Yellow streak, Collins.

514
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,640
Gutless.

515
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,800
If that’s the way you want it,
I’m waiting.

516
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,480
I’ll save my energies for Craig.

517
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,960
I’ll see you at the Debutante’s Ball.

518
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,000
Whoa!

519
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,280
MAN: What is it?

520
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,080
I heard something.

521
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,000
Settle them down!

522
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,160
There’s nothing here.

523
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,840
Arrgh!

524
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,680
Very funny.

525
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,440
Well, come on, let’s go!

526
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,360
Come on!
You’ve already lost two hours of light.

527
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,240
Did you hear about last night?
No.

528
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,000
Alistair Patton
and a mob of his mates

529
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,520
ran into that stallion of yours.

530
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,000
Oh, yeah?

531
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,640
Young McKay was killed.

532
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,560
We’ll talk to you alone, Jim.

533
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,400
We’ll both hear what you have to say.

534
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,720
You were warned this might happen.

535
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,120
Bringing HER up here.

536
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,000
McKay’s death is a consequence.

537
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,600
How do you figure that?

538
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,320
It was bound to happen.

539
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,320
Now those rich bastards will use it
as another stick to beat us with.

540
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:30,000
You put it all on Jessica?

541
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,160
That’s not right, Jake, and you know it.

542
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,520
We’re being mindful of our families.

543
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,160
She should go back
to where she belongs.

544
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,920
We’re staying here.

545
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:48,000
Well, it’s your problem -
and you fix it on your own.

546
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,920
And you shoot that stallion ...

547
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,200
... or I will.

548
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,840
I liked Jamie McKay.

549
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,560
And such a happy ...
Don’t, Jess.

550
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,680
Now he’s dead.

551
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,120
You mustn’t blame yourself.

552
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:43,960
Can’t you see?
It’s turned out exactly as I said it would.

553
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,520
No.

554
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,800
It’s got nothing to do with US.

555
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,240
They made their own decisions.

556
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,640
Will you stop trying to tell me

557
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,920
that we are not responsible
for OUR own decisions?!

558
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:03,160
If you hadn’t stopped me going home,
this wouldn’t have happened!

559
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,640
Jessica.

560
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,960
I’ll be back in a while, alright?

561
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,040
Do you want to earn some money?

562
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,000
Depends.

563
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,000
100 horses.

564
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,920
Yours ...

565
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,320
... when they’re over the border.

566
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,440
Worth a fortune.

567
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,560
Settling a score, are we?

568
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,040
Does it matter?

569
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,600
Yeah, I prefer straight-out business.

570
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,080
If we start immediately, we can’t fail.

571
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:28,200
I’ll need a token to convince the boys.

572
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,880
Bullshit. You could buy them for a beer.

573
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,360
But ... to show you ...

574
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,640
Done!

575
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,760
How far?
About 10 minutes.

576
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,160
Jess ...

577
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,640
She’s not here, mate.

578
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,200
Where is she?
I don’t know.

579
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,560
When I got here, the place was empty.

580
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,880
Where are you off to?
To find her.

581
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,320
Where?

582
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,760
Back down, I think.

583
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,800
In case I’m wrong and she comes back,
will you stay here for a bit?

584
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:38,000
Sure.
Thanks. See you.

585
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,440
You’ve got to help me with this, Harrison.

586
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,120
Why don’t you go to the police, Patton?
That’s what they’re for.

587
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,680
I don’t want the police mixed up with this.

588
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,240
Uh, you know the country up there.

589
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:20,840
I want you to lead a party
and bring Alistair back.

590
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,040
You mean you want me to stop him
from doing something stupid.

591
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,160
Bring Alistair back

592
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,200
and I’ll make sure that your loan
goes straight through.

593
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:35,520
How is it every conversation with you
sooner or later turns to money?

594
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:37,040
None of this would’ve happened

595
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,600
if you’d been capable
of controlling your daughter!

596
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,960
like some spoiled child.

597
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,720
Your daughter is responsible
for Alistair’s state of mind!

598
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,040
She lied to him. Led him on.
Played the coquette with him.

599
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,200
You know,
you’re a very lucky man, Patton.

600
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:05,360
In another place and not so very
long ago, you’d be dead right now.

601
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:12,760
I’m going to make allowances because
of the worry your son has caused you.

602
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,680
My daughter’s been the only
honest person in this whole affair.

603
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,800
We’re the ones who tried
to twist every advantage out of it.

604
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:31,040
And now, I’ve been patient enough
with you, Mr Patton.

605
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,720
Here’s your loan application ...

606
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,160
... and there’s the door.

607
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,760
You’re finished with the bank.

608
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,360
That’s a different story altogether.

609
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,760
I must love you.

610
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,640
Couldn’t get any further
than Eureka Creek.

611
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,400
Ya!

612
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,600
MAN: Someone get a doctor!

613
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,360
Seb. Are you alright?

614
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,880
Nothing that a bit of horsehair
and green gum sapling won’t fix.

615
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,320
What happened?

616
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:55,480
They were driving away your horses,
mate.

617
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:56,440
What?

618
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,040
They ran straight over the top of me.

619
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:01,600
Who?
I recognised Alistair Patton.

620
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,520
There was a fair mob of them.

621
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:04,960
Get him inside.

622
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,960
MAN: One, two, three.

623
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,400
NOW do we start to fight them?

624
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,560
The scores are even.
One of theirs for one of ours.

625
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,920
That’s your own son!

626
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,080
I’m talking about all our sons.
All our women and kids.

627
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,520
Oh, no!

628
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,040
You can’t let him go alone.

629
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,200
Whoa!

630
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,520
Come on, Den.

631
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:10,320
I need YOU for this one.

632
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,080
Right. Come on, Den.

633
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,200
Get up!

634
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:51,120
Tell them to ease up a bit.

635
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:54,000
Nobody’s going to be troubling us
out here.

636
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,480
Ha!

637
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:06,760
Come on!

638
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,480
Get up!

639
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:48,760
Come on, Den. That’s it.

640
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,040
Whoa, lad.

641
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,840
MAN: That’s Craig.

642
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,920
ALISTAIR:
He’s outsmarted himself up there.

643
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:13,080
There’s no way down.
Hmm. Don’t forget who he is.

644
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,680
HA!

645
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,680
Ha!

646
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,160
You killed him.

647
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:37,280
Maybe.

648
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,680
I want to make sure.

649
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,960
No bloody fear!

650
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,720
Let’s get out of it!

651
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,760
Oh, no.

652
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,320
Not you.

653
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,960
What have I done?

654
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,360
What have I...?

655
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,800
I’m so sorry.

656
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,440
My poor old friend.

657
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,480
Get back! Go on!

658
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,760
Get back!

659
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,320
Whoa, big man.

660
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,600
Whoa.

661
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,600
Yeah, you know me, don’t you?

662
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,960
Now ... I need your help.

663
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,240
That’s it.

664
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:50,800
I’m not going to hurt you.

665
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:53,280
Just stand.

666
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:55,920
That’s it.

667
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,600
I’m going to touch you now.

668
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,480
Come on, you wild old thing.

669
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:14,720
Good.

670
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,680
Good man.

671
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:19,360
Whoa.

672
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,400
Whoa.

673
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,440
Look at this.

674
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,200
Have a look at it.

675
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,680
Just have a look at it. Come on.

676
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,680
It’s alright.

677
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:56,080
Good boy. Good.

678
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,840
Whoa!

679
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,920
Steady. Steady, now.

680
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,200
Steady, now. Steady, now.

681
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:06,800
Just stand.

682
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:09,360
Alright.

683
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:39,760
Oh!

684
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,800
Get back here, you ...

685
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,560
Easy, boy. Easy.

686
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,680
Well, let’s go!

687
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,160
Alright!

688
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:17,560
ALL: Ah!

689
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:57,560
MAN: That’s it!

690
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:13,000
Come on, hurry up.

691
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:24,760
Yeah.

692
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,240
MAN: They’re onto us.

693
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:17,920
There’s hundreds of the bastards.

694
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:22,400
Ya! Get out of here.
MAN: Come on! Come on!

695
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:29,400
Come on. Come on.

696
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:00,080
Downriver!

697
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,200
Wait! Split up!

698
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,200
We’ll get round in front of them.

699
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,240
Let’s get out of here!

700
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:02,600
Get around them!

701
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,880
MAN: Get in there!

702
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,960
MAN: Look out!

703
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,400
Come on!

704
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:04,000
Ya!

705
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,480
Ha!

706
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:28,000
Ya!

707
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:37,440
Arggh!

708
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,880
Ya!

709
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:48,640
Get up!

710
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:01,880
Ooh!

711
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,280
No! No!

712
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,480
It’s alright. Alright.

713
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:38,400
You’re the best, old man.

714
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:42,840
You should be free.

715
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,160
Off you go.

716
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:41,000
It’s alright now, Jess.

717
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:52,040
Thank God.

718
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:58,080
You know,
I really missed you, Jess.

719
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:00,000
I missed you too.

720
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,640
I was wrong.

721
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:05,720
And I was stupid.

722
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,480
I’m sorry.

723
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:12,840
Never heard you
say that before.

724
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:15,120
But you’re here.

725
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:17,720
You’re both here. Nothing else matters.

726
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:31,480
My God.

727
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,520
Well, Bridget Darcy.

728
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:40,040
It must be 15 years.
What ... what the hell are you doing here?

729
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:43,520
Running a respectable hotel.
And it’s more like 20 years.

730
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:45,480
Well, you certainly have changed.

731
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,680
You used to be very shy,
as I remember it.

732
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:49,640
You wouldn’t say boo to a goose.

733
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:52,880
More’s the pity. I might’ve got
a few things straightened out.

734
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:56,840
But unfortunately, young ladies were
required to be submissive in those days.

735
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,680
If we’re going to continue
to have this little talk ...

736
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:02,440
Talk?! Huh! You never
talked to a woman in your life!

737
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:05,960
You’ve just made speeches at them.
I don’t have to listen to this.

738
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,520
You’re darn right!
You can get off the place.

739
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:11,040
And that’s a phrase
I’m sure you know very well.

740
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:18,240
This is a public house, isn’t it?

741
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:21,280
I want a drink before I leave.

742
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:22,800
See the barman.

743
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:25,400
And I’ll buy one for you too ...

744
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:27,920
... Mrs Darcy.

745
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:56,240
We are gathered here ...

746
01:32:56,280 --> 01:33:01,600
We’re gathered here to join
two of our best-loved children ...

747
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:03,560
... in holy wedlock.

748
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:08,040
Will you come down from there, Reilly?!

749
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:11,280
You won’t like it if you get
rained on during the performance.

750
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:14,720
Performance?! It’s a holy sacrament
going on down here, you heathen!

751
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:16,800
Please yourself.

752
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:21,760
And for those of you unacquainted
with the ways of Mother Church,

753
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:23,200
take your hats off!

754
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:26,360
Shh. She’s here.

755
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:13,520
Jessica ... and Jim.

756
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,720
You have come together in this church

757
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:20,480
so that the Lord may seal
and strengthen your love

758
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:25,280
in the presence of the church’s minister
in this community ...
