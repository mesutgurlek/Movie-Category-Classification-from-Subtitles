1
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:17,526
Find any gold in your new mine?

2
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,872
No, no Nothing yet.

3
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:28,677
Yeah, yeah. Four years you've
wasted with nothing to show for it

4
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,969
Hey Sam, Your young man arrive
yet?

5
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:18,983
I'm here but he's late showin' up

6
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,470
Hey, stay under. Don't you see the
rain?

7
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:32,270
What, don't you think me wise
enough to keep my head dry?

8
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:39,680
Too old, that it? Not young enough
to have no sense?

9
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,410
That's it precisely.

10
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,056
Age is no offense.

11
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:52,359
I keep getting older with nothin' to
show for it.

12
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:56,023
The desire is there but no pleasure.

13
00:18:57,002 --> 00:19:01,530
You still got some bite. Tomorrow
we'll get the supplies

14
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:10,905
Yeah yeah, what do l have to fear?
Of age? Of anything?

15
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,814
Soon we'll be . . . . rich.

16
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,525
I hope I can be useful out there.

17
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:34,433
My double crossing partner did
most of the work last time

18
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:38,939
No feeling left in these hands.

19
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:43,342
Perhaps there is one thing that can
arouse your sense of touch

20
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:50,516
Well maybe there is.

21
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:52,619
Perhaps . . . . . . perhaps

22
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:02,138
The path is getting narrower.

23
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:03,503
Very treacherous ahead.

24
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:17,876
Careful, there could be falling rocks

25
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:32,192
Careful, we can't lose any of the
equipment.

26
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:46,680
Clumsy oaf.

27
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:54,322
You're going down there.

28
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:55,959
I can't go down there.

29
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,950
-You dropped it. You get it.
-No! You'll leave me down there.

30
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:00,790
-We need everything.
- No, it's too dangerous.

31
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:09,202
No more talk!

32
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:07,949
-Let him climb back himself.
- are you crazy?

33
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:09,385
Get me out of here!

34
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:04,313
Hurry up, we're losing time.

35
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:10,050
He's shaken up. Just give us a
minute.

36
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:13,151
Tough. We've got to move. Now!
Now!

37
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:34,138
No ones touched it. No one.
