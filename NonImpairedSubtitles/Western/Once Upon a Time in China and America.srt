1
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:09,386
Hey

2
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:11,891
Stop! Hey!

3
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,101
Stop! Mister

4
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:29,574
What is your name?

5
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:30,680
Shit!

6
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:33,541
It means...

7
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,354
...asking for your name

8
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,820
There is a "Shit" man

9
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,223
wanting us to stop

10
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:42,388
But in such remote places,

11
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:43,889
we should not stop...

12
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,221
...for strangers

13
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,297
He may die of thirst

14
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:49,928
if we don't stop for him

15
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,438
Seven, tell him to pull over at once

16
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:53,865
Yes

17
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,567
Master, I've been eating too many
beans and suffer diarrhea from it

18
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,709
If I don't have rice soon,
I'll die too

19
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,976
Stop!

20
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,475
Fai-hong, he can't hear you

21
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,914
What are you doing?

22
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,879
Climbing!

23
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,885
Pal, please stop to save that guy

24
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,086
What kind of talk's it?

25
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,260
What are you doing?

26
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,346
Craziest damn thing I've ever seen

27
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,191
Nothing makes me happier than
saving a life

28
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,326
How about saving yourself first?

29
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:58,868
Much obliged Ma'am,

30
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,997
folks round here call me Billy!

31
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,172
Nice to meet you!

32
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,500
I am Wong Fai-hong!

33
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:06,542
Pleasure!

34
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,439
This is a good chance...

35
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,344
...to practice your English,
come on

36
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,943
Who, what, where, when!

37
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,554
Who, what, where, when!

38
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:18,887
When!

39
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:19,788
When what?

40
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,393
I am Diana

41
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:23,223
Pleasure Ma'am

42
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:24,955
When?

43
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,327
Nothing

44
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:34,335
You know how?

45
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:35,605
I know everything!

46
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,371
See, here is the America,

47
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,074
and right there is where we are,

48
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,703
right there, that's my home town

49
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,676
My folks and I lived back east
for a while

50
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:24,479
But things didn't work out

51
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,309
So we moved out here looking for
a new start

52
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:27,517
You know what I mean?

53
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:29,816
Yeah

54
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:30,754
Yeah! Yeah!

55
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,857
Ma'am

56
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:32,982
Hi

57
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,222
You really understand what he said?

58
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,560
No

59
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,294
I simply pretend that I do

60
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:46,562
Yeah?

61
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:47,396
Yeah!

62
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:48,430
Yeah!

63
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:49,498
Yeah!

64
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:52,406
Yeah!

65
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:53,738
Yeah... Yeah...

66
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:57,810
Cut the bull shit and start eating

67
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,115
It's beans again?

68
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,679
We have to be very lucky to make it
to the America

69
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,555
Ah Sol's clinic...

70
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:10,753
there is also called
Po Chi Lam right?

71
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,664
Exactly under the same name

72
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:21,202
Having to go through this...

73
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,366
...to pay him a visit,

74
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,271
he must be joking

75
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,643
Master, we ain't no need to live
on beans anymore

76
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,080
Where are you going?

77
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,220
How would you like to have
chicken buff for appetizer?

78
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,751
Coffee, tea, or me?

79
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,723
Or me? How do I drink you?

80
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,834
You are such a woodshed

81
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:02,739
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H,

82
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:05,948
I, J, K, L, M, N...

83
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,282
Do you like O?

84
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,157
I like an O!

85
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,159
Now,

86
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,462
don't you ever say that
I have no sense of humour

87
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,481
Thank you Ma'am

88
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,753
I've told you never
talk to strangers

89
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:43,154
Come on

90
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:37,867
Be careful!

91
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:13,574
Daddy!

92
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,641
Go, let's go

93
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,192
No-shadow Kick!

94
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,401
Master, many barbarians here!

95
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:38,426
Protect Aunt Yee

96
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:39,638
Yes!

97
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:53,342
I can manage on my own

98
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,712
Move out

99
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:56,847
Fai-hong, Seven!

100
00:11:58,584 --> 00:11:59,983
The horses are beyond control

101
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,155
Give me a ride!

102
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,913
Yee, I'm here to save you!

103
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,781
Seven!

104
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,019
This is dangerous, go back in

105
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,152
Yes!

106
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:40,517
Hands off my carriage

107
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,052
Where is your Master?
Fai-hong, where are you?

108
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,628
What did you say? I can't hear you
Take care of your back

109
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,229
Watch my kick!

110
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:50,859
I don't need you

111
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:53,496
Out!

112
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:54,430
Sit properly

113
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:19,422
Be care

114
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,257
Hold it tight!

115
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:35,772
Fai-hong...

116
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,710
Fai-hong...

117
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:41,580
Yee...

118
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:42,654
Master

119
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,552
Seven...

120
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:45,882
Yee...

121
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:52,388
Fai...

122
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,103
Fai-hong...

123
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,122
Thank you Billy!

124
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,021
Ma'am!

125
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,529
That's all I have to show for
gratitude from me and my family

126
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:25,994
Go on take it

127
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:27,160
Thanks

128
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,391
It's quality!

129
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,904
Hi, boss, these are clean

130
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:44,544
Let's go!

131
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,280
Hi Lola!

132
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,252
Hi how are you? Lone

133
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,322
I'm fine, thank you

134
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:54,550
Beer

135
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,889
Hello, Dr. So
Hi Susan

136
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:59,653
You've got dark circles
under your eyes

137
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,566
Did you get not enough sleep
last night?

138
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:02,990
OK! I guess

139
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,860
Well! Why don't I come over
to your clinic later

140
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,164
So you can check me up

141
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,439
Sure, sure. Come by anytime!

142
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:13,545
Yes... why don't you come
along with Lola too?

143
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:19,146
I'll buy you a drink!

144
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:19,980
Are you sure?

145
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:20,916
It's alright

146
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,714
OK

147
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:22,821
See you later

148
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,527
No beer for Chinamen

149
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,893
This one's on me

150
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,751
You just passing through?

151
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,189
No

152
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,894
Hello. Mr. Mayor

153
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,387
Out!

154
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,532
I just want to...

155
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,527
Take it easy son, he's the Mayor!

156
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:14,900
Out...
Why are you doing this for...

157
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:16,005
Out

158
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:17,199
Let's go

159
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,272
I am sorry

160
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,848
Problem?

161
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:30,522
Just a little one!

162
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,191
Remember, you ain't Abraham Lincoln

163
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,493
C'mon, let me buy you a drink

164
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,456
No, thanks Sheriff
Abraham Lincoln doesn't drink

165
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,782
No big deal!

166
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,621
The beer in town isn't good enough!

167
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,262
Sit down...

168
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,195
Let me take a look!

169
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:15,096
It hurts
It's alright

170
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,189
Take a seat...

171
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,767
Wait

172
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,307
How's he doing?

173
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,056
Po Chi Lam? What's that mean?

174
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,359
Advertisement!

175
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,526
Dr. So, help!

176
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,567
Dr. So, where are you?

177
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:51,691
Bring them in...

178
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,031
What's happened?

179
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,236
We saved them...

180
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,901
...from the Gold Sand River

181
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,170
They've waken up for a short while,

182
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:02,245
then again lost consciousness

183
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:05,809
Seven!

184
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:07,581
Aunt Yee

185
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:12,448
Ying,

186
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:13,625
Yes, Master!

187
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,657
Go massage his chest

188
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:16,818
By using the technique which
you have just learnt

189
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,330
Doctor... may I massage
this lady for you?

190
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,399
No... I'll help her...

191
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,865
Stop!
What are you guys fighting for?

192
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,232
Let's take turn

193
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:25,768
I'll be the first. Yes...

194
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:26,927
Wait! She is...

195
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:31,202
She is my master's fiancée,

196
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,899
don't you dare trying a finger on her

197
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,506
Let me give you a hand!

198
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:40,118
If you want to kiss somebody,
kiss me!

199
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:41,883
I ain't trying to kiss her

200
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,889
This white bastard actually
wants more!

201
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,623
Shut up

202
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,283
She's awake now

203
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,052
Seven!

204
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,254
Aunt Yee

205
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,123
I am damn hungry

206
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:55,891
Seven!

207
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:57,335
Fai-hong!

208
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:18,951
I have a new son!

209
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,598
This weave is excellent,
we should learn how to do it

210
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:31,862
Father, the great spirit has
blessed me with another son

211
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,593
Where am I?

212
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,163
Stop!

213
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,210
Why do you treat him so badly?

214
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:14,638
His coat is different,

215
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,511
his skin color is different,

216
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,314
his speech is different

217
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,248
His blood is red. Like us

218
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:21,477
My God!

219
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:22,884
But, it will not flow for us

220
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,985
In the end I afraid
we will be bleeding for him

221
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:26,515
No!

222
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,887
Go away

223
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,158
How can you be so rude to a lady?

224
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,378
What is your name? What is your name?
What is your name?

225
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:50,639
What is your name?
What is your name?

226
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,786
"What is your name" means...

227
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,679
...what's your name in Chinese!

228
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,948
What is your name?

229
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,219
Master,
I've been eating too many beans,

230
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,761
if I don't have rice soon,
I'll die too

231
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,903
Watch out! The Red Hair's coming

232
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:35,986
I beg your pardon

233
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:46,593
Wong Fai-hong... Master Wong...

234
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:50,805
Aunt Yee

235
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,809
Aunt Yee,
would you like a cup of tea?

236
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,079
Master Wong

237
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,751
Wong Fai-hong

238
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,553
This is Master's umbrella!

239
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,055
Aunt Yee...

240
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:08,552
Look, this is Master's umbrella

241
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:14,093
Aunt Yee,
shall we have lunch first?

242
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,698
I ain't hungry. You guys go ahead

243
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,072
What are you Chinese doing here?

244
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,166
We are looking for a friend

245
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:24,974
He had an accident up river

246
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,906
Now you know Mayor Barclay...

247
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,776
...doesn't wanna see you
Chinese outside your alley

248
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,876
Would you just pretend
you did not see us?

249
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,615
Sorry. No, I can't do

250
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,414
You bastard,
we are only searching for our friend

251
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:42,826
They treat us Chinese miners
like dogs,

252
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,520
having all kinds of
restrictions on us

253
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:46,358
Yeah!
We are always on the wrong side

254
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,796
Shall we stand together and
overcome him now?

255
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:53,698
No... The sergeant is nice to us
Chinese indeed!

256
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,174
Remember?

257
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,741
He had driven away some white
bastards for us several times

258
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,371
Let's go!

259
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:02,904
Hey!

260
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:03,972
Yes?

261
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:05,375
Remember,

262
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:08,017
no Chinese women allowed here

263
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,248
That's the law

264
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:11,884
I will not forget

265
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,861
Goodbye, Mr Lincoln

266
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:29,003
Don't worry Ma'am
Wong Fei-hong is gonna be just fine

267
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,906
Hey! What are you doing here?

268
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,144
Behave yourself or
I won't give you face

269
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:35,376
What?

270
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,506
"What"? The hell!

271
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,817
What the hell? I like that

272
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:24,720
It's raining dogs and cats,
please go back inside

273
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:29,665
No, Fai-hong won't find us
when he is back

274
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:35,395
Master would be upset
if you fell sick

275
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,937
Exactly, please go back inside

276
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,102
Fai-hong...

277
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:10,568
Yee...

278
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,070
Master...

279
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:13,871
Seven...

280
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:16,080
Yee...

281
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,606
Water topples a boat and

282
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,308
so it floats one

283
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,350
Hardness and softness can grow
or temper with each other

284
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,580
This is the spirit of Tai Chi

285
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:24,881
Reckless movement repels,
stay clam and you stay as one piece

286
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,148
Understand?

287
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,418
OK, show me what you have learnt
from Tai Chi

288
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,117
Yes, Master

289
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,585
Give way...

290
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,249
What are you guys looking at?

291
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,224
It is a woman

292
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:04,285
What's so excited about a woman?

293
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:05,989
Uncle Han, don't you think
you're too old for that?

294
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:07,723
But I can still see well...

295
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:08,866
...with my eyes

296
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,326
Shoot!
We are closed for business today

297
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:13,763
Aunt Yee!

298
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:15,806
Seven, help me to check its texture

299
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:17,772
Yes!

300
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:18,604
Should I add more water?

301
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:21,711
Good! ...Good!...

302
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,623
Sol, what are you eating?

303
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:41,862
This is glue

304
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:44,698
Is it sticky enough?

305
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:45,961
Very!

306
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,274
And you!
Why did you say it tastes good?

307
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,534
I did not! I was only nodding

308
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:54,542
Go post these Lost and

309
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:55,442
Found bills on the street

310
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,676
Yes Ma'am

311
00:26:58,683 --> 00:26:59,411
Let's go, gluey-mouth

312
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:15,162
Post one here

313
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,776
Post one here!

314
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,681
Hey! What the hell you boys think
you're doing here?

315
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,349
Why did you tear...

316
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,323
...our poster away?

317
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:43,588
We're looking for our master!

318
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:45,853
You can't hang those posters here!

319
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:47,431
What did he say?

320
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,929
Nothing... Let's go

321
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:55,163
You hang one more poster,
you're going to jail

322
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,780
Forget about them! Let's go

323
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:07,243
Deputy!

324
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:24,529
Damn!

325
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:25,499
The money

326
00:28:58,837 --> 00:28:59,667
Hey, you are good

327
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:00,965
Thanks partner,

328
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,007
when are you going to teach me

329
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:04,100
What?

330
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,305
This!

331
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:09,278
Can you show me?

332
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,876
You want to learn leg stance?

333
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:13,881
If not you can put up
with the hardship

334
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,387
Like this!

335
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:17,819
Press each of your legs like this
for 4 hours

336
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:22,091
That's all it takes

337
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:23,091
Alright

338
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:24,884
OK boys, you're under arrest,

339
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:26,464
the jail's that way

340
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:29,527
Take it easy partner
I've got everything under control

341
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,227
Yeah, move it

342
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,037
Alright come on

343
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,800
What do they call you son?

344
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:37,603
My name is Billy!

345
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,303
Billy,
interested in being my deputy?

346
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,777
We'll talk after I get my reward

347
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:45,444
Nick

348
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,177
You done yet?

349
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:48,545
God damn Sheriff

350
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:53,090
you made me lose my count
Now I have to start all over again

351
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:55,921
Sheriff, the pay is bad

352
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,391
I've to cut partial of my freedom

353
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,860
I understand!

354
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,988
You can come to work with me
only when there is a trouble

355
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,936
Sheriff, you got yourself a deputy

356
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:09,536
Good, try this on for size

357
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,186
Hi, if you see this man,

358
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,317
we're at the clinic

359
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:35,199
If you see this man,

360
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,130
we're at the clinic

361
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:39,902
How about a drink?

362
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,233
No, thank you

363
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:44,899
When I say drink,

364
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,939
you drink

365
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,437
Hey! Leave him alone

366
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:50,206
You shut up

367
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:03,085
Have another

368
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,470
You are a pretty China doll

369
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,600
Hey lady where are you going?

370
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,841
If you don't want to drink

371
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,478
Then wear it!

372
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:30,919
Stop it stop it stop it...

373
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,654
Aunt Yee! Aunt Yee

374
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:47,071
Now all the boys,
I wouldn't do that if I were you,

375
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:55,707
you wanna fight,
well, you've got one

376
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,625
I ain't looking for no fight

377
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,254
That's good

378
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,559
Now I want a fight!
Seven, teach them a lesson

379
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:13,864
Sure!

380
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:18,162
Why don't we try something different,
pal?

381
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,435
Care for a friendly wager?

382
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:24,506
Now I bet this Chinamen can
wipe you out...

383
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:25,631
...without your guns

384
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,277
And my money is on the Chinamen, pal

385
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:29,379
which one is man enough
to fight him?

386
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:57,200
I win!

387
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,501
No, this is only good for a warm up
since master isn't around

388
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:00,672
Sol, translate for me

389
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:01,809
What?

390
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:03,312
Tell them to fight me all at once

391
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,316
They are the winner
if anyone of them beat me

392
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:06,379
What did he say?

393
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:09,449
He said he wants to fight you all

394
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:11,254
If you win, you can keep the money

395
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,516
AII? Wait a minute,

396
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,122
we might lose!

397
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,054
Seven, he said if...

398
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:18,958
Trust me

399
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,095
Trust me

400
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,232
Sorry! Trust him!

401
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:04,907
I am a happy man

402
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,072
Me too

403
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,644
Aunt Yee, what about you?

404
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,605
Me too

405
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:13,942
Thank you!

406
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,156
How can I enjoy
this beautiful landscape now?

407
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:27,322
Why don't you take me back to...

408
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,729
...where you found me?

409
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,859
Maybe I can remember
where I come from

410
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,734
Only you have no idea
on what I am saying

411
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:44,279
Clothes, how I wish you could talk

412
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,947
Then you would be able to
explain everything

413
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:05,629
Master... America... Setting up
Po Chi Lam... One year anniversary,

414
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:08,894
Sol...

415
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,131
What's this letter about?

416
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,702
Is it by me or for me?

417
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,541
My name is Sol?

418
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:24,118
...and I have a master?

419
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:27,884
I must find him,
he will have the answer

420
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:32,151
Wong Fai!

421
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,398
This name sounds familiar,

422
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,100
I must have known him

423
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:39,965
If I found him,
everything would be explained

424
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:07,195
What can I do for you?

425
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:12,362
I want to marry your daughter!

426
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,604
How dare you insult my sister?

427
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,102
You are the weakest among
all the tribes,

428
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,978
if you don't give me your daughter,

429
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:23,011
I will destroy you all

430
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:27,945
Fierce Eagle!

431
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:33,380
We are not afraid of you,
we will fight you to death!

432
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:44,399
Fierce Eagle!

433
00:36:58,916 --> 00:36:59,814
Please, do not fight!

434
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,278
Hey, don't...

435
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,553
Yellow, please do not fight him

436
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:24,231
Hey...

437
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:39,355
Come on!

438
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,270
Let me try

439
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:35,441
What are you doing?

440
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:46,082
Stop it. Don't!

441
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,258
I'm good, I'm good...

442
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:26,995
I really envy you guys

443
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,866
At least you know where is your root

444
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:33,495
I don't even know where I come from

445
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:35,965
The sunshine's beautiful
on this land

446
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,907
but the sunshine is
more beautiful on our land

447
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,006
But, we were forced to leave our home

448
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:47,543
You don't understand a bit of
what I'm saying

449
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,718
That's fine, at least you are lucky

450
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:54,890
Unlike me, I keep thinking...

451
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:56,449
...where I should be heading

452
00:39:58,195 --> 00:39:59,287
I know,

453
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:02,059
someday I shall return to my land,

454
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:03,927
to my home

455
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,477
For bleeding for our tribe

456
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:22,912
Thank you

457
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:30,654
From now on,
verbal communication is not necessary

458
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,795
Body language is much better, right?

459
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,292
I tried to forget,
but the vision keeps coming back

460
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,230
Damn it!

461
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:14,902
I must learn to let go

462
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:16,902
Yellow!

463
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:24,942
You like it?

464
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:28,716
Take it!

465
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:38,826
Fai-hong, have a smoke!

466
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:44,329
Oh shit!
Aunt Yee is being possessed

467
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,601
Nah, it is not that

468
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:48,702
What's it then?

469
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:52,640
Master's stuff reminds her of him

470
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,811
Master?

471
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:58,177
Though I did not like you to smoke,

472
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:08,349
it isn't my main concern now

473
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:49,432
What is taking him so long
to take a shit?

474
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:51,598
Are you hungry?

475
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:52,691
Take your shit

476
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:03,066
Come on...

477
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,207
Come on...

478
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:12,482
Come on...

479
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:17,919
Come on...

480
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:02,993
I think I've seen him before

481
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:05,764
Let's go

482
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:12,868
Hey! Look what we got here
We got some rich Indians

483
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,709
Hey, I'm talking to you,
stinking red skin

484
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:21,418
Why don't you show me and
my boys one of your war dances?

485
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:23,747
I do not dance for the white man

486
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:40,469
You're dancing now, ain't you?

487
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:49,805
Isn't he Fai-hong?

488
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:47,762
You're a woman?

489
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:54,442
Why are you following us?

490
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,544
I'm looking for him

491
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,071
Fai-hong!

492
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:02,049
Fai-hong? Who is Fai-hong?

493
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:04,075
You are Fai-hong!

494
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:06,281
Am I? Then who are you?

495
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:10,786
I am Yee, Aunt Yee, your fiancée!

496
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:12,195
Since you are my aunt,

497
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:13,954
how can you be my fiancée as well?

498
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:16,228
Yellow?

499
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:19,697
Your name is Yellow?

500
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,531
All the people here call me Yellow

501
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:36,345
You cannot just grab that!

502
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:53,636
A, B, C, D, E...

503
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:58,431
Take it back!

504
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:03,644
She can't do without the ring,

505
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:04,974
why wouldn't she want it?

506
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:16,492
Yellow, that girl knows you,

507
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:18,354
you must follow her

508
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,359
The darker of your inside is
taking over

509
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:26,560
That's why I feel sick?

510
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,064
Absolutely

511
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:30,106
So I must sit under the sun more?

512
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:35,936
Aunt Yee is making a mess
in Po Chi Lam

513
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,714
Everyone in Po Chi Lam tries to
stay away from her

514
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:41,075
And you thought
Master had bad temper?

515
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:44,420
You should check her out now

516
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,617
We haven't seen Chinese women
for ages

517
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:47,757
How is it when Aunt Yee gets mad?

518
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:49,523
Sol...

519
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:51,793
Aunt Yee is making a fuss again

520
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:53,263
What's the fuss this time?

521
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:55,262
She is packing up

522
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,733
Aunt Yee, where do you want to go?

523
00:48:58,201 --> 00:48:58,758
Back to China

524
00:48:59,202 --> 00:48:59,827
China?

525
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:00,904
What?

526
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,064
Prepare a carriage for me,
I am going home

527
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:05,170
Am I clear?

528
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:06,835
Yes, of course

529
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,071
Seven, prepare the carriage

530
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:10,877
Why so?

531
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:15,676
Aunt Yee is having
odd thinking again

532
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:19,320
Take her for a walk
around the block,

533
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:22,185
then tell her she's already home

534
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:25,119
OK, I get it!

535
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:26,954
Aunt Yee, shall we?

536
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:29,258
What are you doing?

537
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:32,599
You really think I am insane?

538
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:35,204
I know how to get back to China

539
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,730
It takes 10 days to reach
San Francisco by carriage,

540
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:39,533
Another six months...

541
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:40,904
...to Hong Kong by ship

542
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:43,239
From there it takes 3 days'
on train to Canton,

543
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:44,641
then again by carriage to Fu Shan

544
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:47,281
Whatever you say will not change
my decision

545
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:52,852
Now will you go prepare
the carriage?

546
00:49:59,062 --> 00:49:59,926
Fine

547
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:02,230
Aunt Yee, we are ready now

548
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:14,608
Seven

549
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,771
Aunt Yee, this way please...

550
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:31,356
Aunt Yee,
I have forgotten my luggage,

551
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:32,392
I must go back

552
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:34,054
Carry it Sol

553
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:42,432
Aunt Yee...

554
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:44,167
Aunt Yee...

555
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:47,799
Aunt Yee...

556
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,035
Aunt Yee, it's master!

557
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,473
Master...

558
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,440
Aunt Yee, Master...

559
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:01,880
May I ask...

560
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:02,687
I accept no explanation from you

561
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,118
Aunt Yee...

562
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,092
I ain't here to explain, I just...

563
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,024
I don't want to hear anything

564
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:12,165
You happen to know someone
called Sol?

565
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,029
Sol?

566
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:16,871
What about Wong Fai?
Does it ring the bell?

567
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:23,343
I go ask her then

568
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:26,846
Master is teasing us, isn't he?

569
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:30,747
No... Master seems to have lost
his memory

570
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,684
Piss off! Leave me alone, would you?

571
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:38,524
You are Aunt Yee right?

572
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:39,617
I am not!

573
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:40,594
Do you know Wong Fai then?

574
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:41,895
Wong... what?

575
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:52,499
Please stop!

576
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:54,603
Aunt Yee

577
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:58,474
I don't give allowance just
because you're a woman

578
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:00,781
What are you doing?

579
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:02,908
Checking your pulse

580
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:07,312
Aunt Yee, Master suffers...

581
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:08,385
...from loss of memory

582
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:09,459
So...

583
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:12,289
He has lost his memory?
What should we do?

584
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:14,130
Let me try

585
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,367
What are you doing?

586
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,633
I want to show you
Wong's super stance,

587
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:25,738
No Shadow Kick

588
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:26,937
Who is Wong Fai-hong?

589
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:28,572
Sure that was you!

590
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:31,072
You are one of the 10 Canton Tigers,
coach of the local militia

591
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:32,714
You live in no. 8,
Sing Nam Street, Fu Shan,

592
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:34,348
you're a doctor

593
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:36,352
You give free treatment to the poor,
and teach Chinese Kung-fu

594
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,452
You are the Master of Po Chi Lam,

595
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:38,646
people's hero,

596
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:40,450
Wong Fai-hong

597
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:42,720
What is 10 Canton Tigers?
And coaching for what?

598
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:44,359
Po Chi Lam?

599
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,189
Free treatment to people?

600
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,387
Kung-fu master?

601
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:48,428
Master of Po Chi Lam,

602
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:49,657
people's hero

603
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,257
Wong Fai-hong?

604
00:52:53,136 --> 00:52:54,034
He is Wong Fai-hong?

605
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,465
Notice that...

606
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:57,834
...we both know this post?

607
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,277
Seven, he forgot who he is

608
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:02,468
Showing him the post has got no use

609
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:12,018
Are you alright?

610
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:13,180
Are you alright, Sol?

611
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,823
Yeah, I'm alright

612
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:16,358
You must help him regain his memory

613
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:22,924
You!

614
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:24,330
Wong Fai-hong,

615
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,834
I, Yim Chun-tung,
will see how good you really are

616
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:49,452
Ha! With my iron cloth martial arts,

617
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:50,490
you can't beat me!

618
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:07,007
Come on!

619
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:15,474
Thicker! Thicker!

620
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,023
Wong Fai-hong,

621
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,657
You should go for my stomach
not my face!

622
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:40,868
Wong Fai-hong,
do you remember Na Lan Yuan Shu?

623
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:44,912
Na Lan Yuan Shu

624
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:54,721
Na Lan Yuan Shu!

625
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:05,225
Quit fooling around

626
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,567
Seven!

627
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:41,300
Follow me!

628
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:51,165
Master,
why are you getting fired up?

629
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,615
Seven, stop fighting with him!

630
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:17,691
Seven!

631
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:19,733
Stop fighting!

632
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:39,979
Fai-hong!

633
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:40,986
Yee!

634
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:43,022
Yee, are you alright?

635
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:43,983
I am fine

636
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:46,587
Seven...

637
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:49,958
I am fine!

638
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:51,924
Seven

639
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:53,100
How did you fall so badly?

640
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:54,600
It wasn't from falling

641
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:57,336
Master, you hit me!

642
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,073
It's okay now, Seven

643
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:02,368
The Master is back!

644
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:13,622
This trip to America...

645
00:58:13,923 --> 00:58:15,083
...is just like a dream

646
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:18,217
I can do with a dream...

647
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:20,790
...with an Indian beauty

648
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,229
What?

649
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:23,833
Only you know the story!

650
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,095
I've just cleaned my face

651
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:31,299
You can give the ring twice,

652
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:31,999
but you can't wash your face twice?

653
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,642
Sure, sure

654
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,110
I can't remember anything

655
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:37,613
I don't understand
what you're talking about

656
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:39,513
Have you thought of that woman?

657
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:40,976
I don't have time
to think about woman

658
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:43,617
Do you miss her?

659
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:45,880
Well, a little bit

660
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,885
You just said
you haven't thought of woman

661
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,157
Thinking and missing are
two different things

662
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,162
If you don't think of her,
how can you miss her?

663
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:55,531
But it's the truth

664
00:58:57,934 --> 00:58:59,026
The truth is I don't want to
talk to you anymore

665
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:04,062
But the one I miss is you

666
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,300
You know...

667
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,843
I can never say
these things out loud

668
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:14,950
The games are about to start. Hurry!

669
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:15,980
Master Wong

670
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:17,313
How's everyone?

671
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:47,211
Master Wong is here, Uncle Lone,
Master Wong is here

672
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:49,010
So?

673
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:50,943
Master Wong doesn't like
people gambling

674
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:52,811
Let's pack it up and gamble later

675
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:54,881
No way,

676
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:56,753
I've just won this game

677
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,052
Hurry up

678
00:59:58,227 --> 01:00:00,092
Master is coming!

679
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:03,822
Have you won?
How much did you bet?

680
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:05,295
I want in

681
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:07,767
Let's gamble together

682
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:08,768
Come on!

683
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:10,601
Master Wong, you too?

684
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,240
Come, let me be the House

685
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:14,908
Come on, come on!

686
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:15,705
Let's have some larger bets

687
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:17,311
Really?

688
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,242
Sure! Bet more!

689
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:23,542
Okay, if Master Wong wants us to,
we'll bet a little

690
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:24,954
Master...

691
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:27,056
Bets down and hands off

692
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:28,020
You've got nowhere...

693
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:28,887
...to spend your money anyway

694
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,118
Why don't you bet it all?

695
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:36,494
Master Wong, you are our hope,

696
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:38,897
you gamble like us,
how can we find a role model?

697
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:40,730
We are not used to seeing
you gambling

698
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:42,564
Master Wong,
why don't you be your normal self?

699
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:43,433
We won't gamble anymore...

700
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:44,866
Today

701
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,274
Get out of here!

702
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:50,106
We understand now

703
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:52,676
People,

704
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:55,417
I thank you all...

705
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:57,686
...for your concern

706
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,090
I have something to say

707
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:05,859
You came a long way...

708
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:08,692
to a foreign place,

709
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:11,458
Po Chi Lam was opened
for this reason

710
01:01:11,634 --> 01:01:14,364
"When they leave home, goods are
worth more and people are worth less"

711
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:17,473
And you should know who you are

712
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,073
I don't hope for good business,
that'll require you being ill

713
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,199
Rather I hope Po Chi Lam...

714
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:23,005
...help you achieve good health,

715
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:24,875
build up a strong body

716
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:27,973
Copy the merits of foreigners and
compensate our short-comings

717
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,209
And shine...

718
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,217
...for the Chinese people

719
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:37,087
Simply put,

720
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,025
you must remember who you are

721
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:43,295
Today, I would like to stop here,

722
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,265
thank you for listening

723
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:52,803
Master Wong, that was a great speech

724
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:53,940
You're too kind...

725
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,436
Let's go...

726
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,204
Sir, take the money,

727
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:00,516
it was hard-earned

728
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:02,779
Master Wong, no more speech please

729
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:03,846
Bye! Bye!

730
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,042
Please excuse me...

731
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,224
Your gold mines dried up

732
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,027
Yeah

733
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:17,888
There's still a little matter of
the $ 150,000 loan,

734
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:19,026
I've discreetly left off the books

735
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:21,732
Your can't even meet the payroll
for your coolies

736
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:26,975
Damn your smell like a pail of dung

737
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:30,506
Here, try some of these

738
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:32,780
Maybe it'll help your breath

739
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:39,382
Put a $ 100,000 is in the safe

740
01:02:39,822 --> 01:02:41,016
I'll take care of everything else

741
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:43,892
What? Another $ 100,000

742
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:45,724
Do as I say

743
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:49,257
Keep your faces covered,

744
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:51,729
I want your identities kept secret

745
01:02:52,568 --> 01:02:53,933
I'd mark pretty face
on every post office and board...

746
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:55,765
besides...

747
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:58,430
...the Mississippi Hell

748
01:02:58,841 --> 01:03:00,331
I want to be famous

749
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:03,075
Shut up!

750
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:08,747
I don't give a damn,
let's just do it

751
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:27,002
Let's do it,
Master Wong won't come this time

752
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:32,468
Why?

753
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:33,736
He is real busy. Come on!

754
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:35,269
I'll be the House
Bet. Bet. Bet

755
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:39,848
It's pay day!

756
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:42,850
Seven,
I'm the 11th child of my family

757
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:46,548
And I was thinking, if you and
I should open a store together,

758
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:49,015
we'll call it 7-11

759
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:55,154
Uncle Han, who is that guy?

760
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:56,823
He is our foreman,

761
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:58,066
and always cheat us

762
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:00,560
So what if you can kick real fast?

763
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:03,138
Don't forget,
this is a world of guns

764
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,764
You can't be as fast as a bullet

765
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:25,424
Have you got the money?

766
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:26,686
Go on and get out of here

767
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:33,367
I thought we had a...

768
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:34,831
Adios

769
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:37,631
Hell, that's too easy,

770
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:38,864
let's find some real excitement

771
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,607
When they start to shoot,
that would be exciting

772
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:36,698
Get back, get out

773
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:49,039
Billy

774
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:50,743
What are you doing?

775
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,204
What do you mean?

776
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:53,982
Yeah, you're alright

777
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:54,912
You alright, Billy?

778
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:12,562
Half a million dollars?

779
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:15,364
"HALF A MILLION ROBBED"

780
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:16,460
What? We only got $ 100,000!

781
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:17,629
What happened to the rest of it?

782
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:20,608
Let's go back and pay the Mayor and
his little town a visit

783
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:23,935
What about Pete?
He isn't gonna to make it

784
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:31,177
Adios, Pete!

785
01:06:52,942 --> 01:06:53,499
Watch out!

786
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:54,334
Master

787
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:57,441
Master Wong

788
01:06:57,747 --> 01:06:58,736
How's everyone?
How are you?

789
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:00,773
Master Wong, is that a new sign?

790
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:01,807
Yes

791
01:07:01,984 --> 01:07:03,076
People,

792
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:04,949
I have something to say today

793
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:08,455
Master, you have something
to say again?

794
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:10,047
Why don't you show us...

795
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:11,091
...some fist dance
instead of a speech?

796
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:11,855
Yeah, come on! Show us

797
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,188
Show us some fist dance! Come on

798
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:15,530
You'll get the chance!

799
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:18,599
Today is the first anniversary of...

800
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:20,392
the American Po Chi Lam

801
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:22,595
First of all,

802
01:07:22,738 --> 01:07:25,366
I would like to thank you all
for taking care of my student Sol

803
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:27,672
Don't mention it,
we are all Chinese!

804
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:30,435
We should help each other,

805
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:31,873
right?

806
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:34,883
People, you've come a long way...

807
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:36,744
to a foreign place

808
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,986
You should co-operate and
take care of each other

809
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:42,724
Po Chi Lam was opened...

810
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:44,554
...for this reason

811
01:07:45,761 --> 01:07:47,729
I don't hope...

812
01:07:47,863 --> 01:07:49,888
...for good business,

813
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,869
that'll require you being ill

814
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:56,162
This is not what I hope for
Instead, I hope that...

815
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:57,534
The American Po Chi Lam...

816
01:07:57,673 --> 01:07:59,368
...would become your club house

817
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:02,201
when you have time,
you can have tea,

818
01:08:02,778 --> 01:08:04,405
chat, and practice Kung-fu here

819
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:07,206
Build up a strong body

820
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:09,444
And come in line...

821
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:10,779
...with Po Chi Lam's spirit

822
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:14,181
Hand in hand
we copy foreigners' merits and

823
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:15,646
compensate our short-comings

824
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:17,715
And shine...

825
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,393
...for the Chinese people

826
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:22,087
That's all

827
01:08:35,978 --> 01:08:38,139
Come in! Refreshment time!

828
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:41,348
Let's go and have some snacks...

829
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:48,785
Master,

830
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,615
I think your speech deserved
some applause

831
01:08:51,594 --> 01:08:54,154
Aunt Yee may come...

832
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:56,557
the timing of Aunt Yee's presence
wasn't right

833
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:58,359
Timing

834
01:08:59,368 --> 01:09:00,096
Timing!

835
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:02,904
Right!

836
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:10,540
Make yourself at home,
there's still more...

837
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:20,116
Welcome... Mr. Mayor,

838
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:22,020
gentlemen, we're pretty surprised

839
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,319
Looks like
you're having a celebration

840
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,124
Get in there men!

841
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:46,406
I reckon you boys have something
to do with the robbery

842
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:47,611
Search the damn place

843
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:50,745
No! It's ridiculous!

844
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:52,285
Quiet!

845
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:54,784
They said we were involved
in the robbery,

846
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:55,891
they want to search this place

847
01:09:57,893 --> 01:09:59,861
No problem, we are innocent!

848
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:01,663
Give way,

849
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:03,021
let the police do their job

850
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:05,200
search this place

851
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:22,810
We've found the money!

852
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:27,414
What? How can it be?

853
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:33,560
Look what we have got here

854
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,559
Arrest every last one
of these Chinese, sons of bitches!

855
01:10:45,207 --> 01:10:48,370
Be careful, Master,
they will shoot!

856
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:54,810
Move!

857
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:56,916
We're innocent,

858
01:10:57,019 --> 01:10:58,145
let us out!

859
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,788
You can't put these people in jail

860
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:02,880
They had nothing to do
with the robbery

861
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:04,550
You don't tell me what I can and
can't do, Billy!

862
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:07,361
Now settle down son

863
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:10,690
Look, I was with Doc Sol and
Seven right before the hold-up

864
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:11,991
They've been framed

865
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:14,469
I don't give a damn if you come up
with a hundred reasons

866
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:16,728
The fact is we found some of
the stolen money...

867
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:17,929
...in Po Chi Lam

868
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,936
If the Chinamen didn't take
the money, who did?

869
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:22,236
Me?

870
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,908
Maybe it was you Billy!

871
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:28,845
No! That's crazy! I shot one of 'em

872
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:30,785
Maybe you were trying to
throw us off

873
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:32,714
Maybe you're working with the gang

874
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:36,656
Easy there, Billy

875
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:39,986
I wont let you do it

876
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:41,889
How are you going to stop me?

877
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:43,093
I'll kill you

878
01:11:57,246 --> 01:11:58,270
Are you alright?

879
01:11:59,114 --> 01:12:00,706
I guess someone was quicker
at that time

880
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:02,682
You're a real friend to the Chinese

881
01:12:03,419 --> 01:12:05,819
Billy! I appreciate you too!

882
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:17,523
Settle down. I said settle down

883
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:28,872
He said he would get
the best deal for us,

884
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:33,441
provided that 7 of us would confess
to the crime,

885
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,547
If we confess do we go jail?

886
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:37,977
You can forget jail,

887
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:39,648
they are going to hang you

888
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:43,316
If you don't confess to the crime,
they're going to hang you all

889
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:44,754
Remember,

890
01:12:44,827 --> 01:12:46,761
they found the money
with you Chinese

891
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:49,795
No, not all the Chinese,

892
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:51,592
only the Po Chi Lam people

893
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:58,866
Uncle Lone is right

894
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:01,438
This is Po Chi Lam's problem,

895
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:02,599
nothing to do with you all

896
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:04,942
Sol, tell the sergeant,

897
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:06,674
can I take all the responsibility?

898
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:10,311
No!

899
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:13,355
You can't confess to the crime alone

900
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:15,523
If you are going to be
the first to confess,

901
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:16,783
I'll be the second

902
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:17,855
Sol!

903
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:19,154
Master my nick name is Seven,

904
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:21,226
if I am not the 3rd one,
I will be the 7th one

905
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:24,159
Fai-hong

906
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:26,297
You all stay here, I'll go alone

907
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:27,695
This is a set up!

908
01:13:28,203 --> 01:13:30,967
Master Wong, you are young
and capable

909
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,274
Your life should be spared for...

910
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:34,966
...the good of we Chinese workers

911
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:37,705
You've nothing to do
with Po Chi Lam,

912
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:39,403
don't get yourself into trouble!

913
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:43,207
Uncle, we are not telling others the
pathetic tales of the Chinese workers

914
01:13:43,886 --> 01:13:46,354
We want to tell the glorious
history of the Chinese workers

915
01:13:48,657 --> 01:13:50,420
I, Wong Fai-hong,
should stand for all of you

916
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,058
Who disagrees?

917
01:13:52,961 --> 01:13:53,757
Come with me

918
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:08,472
Ma'am!

919
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:13,114
Fai-hong

920
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:31,257
It's my fault!

921
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:34,924
I couldn't imagine that,

922
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:37,855
the establishment of Po Chi Lam
in the America a year ago,

923
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:41,902
would pave the way for tragedy

924
01:15:43,105 --> 01:15:45,073
And I dragged Master down too...

925
01:15:46,241 --> 01:15:47,868
Uncle Han, are you afraid?

926
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:55,149
Getting married and working hard,

927
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:59,877
pretending as emperor at home
but working as slave outside...

928
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:03,348
That is my life!

929
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:10,855
Sir, it is our custom,

930
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:13,263
man would die with a full stomach

931
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:14,733
May I feed them?

932
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:26,046
All the prisoners get their
final meal before they're executed

933
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:27,306
What can it hurt?

934
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:43,122
Master Wong

935
01:16:45,467 --> 01:16:47,901
This is all I can do

936
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:58,404
Master Wong,
stuffed dumplings for you

937
01:17:00,582 --> 01:17:01,344
Eat!

938
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:20,527
Master, we all depend on you

939
01:17:21,103 --> 01:17:22,570
Master,
I have full confidence in you

940
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:30,268
I want more!

941
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:39,078
They're waiting!

942
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,094
Go

943
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:53,892
Go away!

944
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:11,778
Why were you not in jail...

945
01:18:12,254 --> 01:18:13,221
...with us?

946
01:18:14,756 --> 01:18:15,848
I didn't do anything

947
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:19,616
I didn't do anything wrong

948
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:25,131
Citizens,

949
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:29,131
as Mayor of this town and
in the name of God

950
01:18:29,905 --> 01:18:33,841
I'm here to witness this fair and
just execution of these men

951
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:37,037
God has decided the day
they are to die

952
01:18:37,913 --> 01:18:40,677
Now I shall decide their hour

953
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:09,105
Escape!

954
01:19:09,177 --> 01:19:10,041
Move everyone

955
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:02,124
Up the way

956
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:26,987
Look out! Sheriff out of the way,
we have to stop him, boys!

957
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:32,721
No! No!

958
01:20:46,808 --> 01:20:49,436
Master Wong, that's the robber
That's the ones who robbed the bank

959
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:53,272
Master, he was the bank robber

960
01:20:54,916 --> 01:20:56,679
I have to get him to clear my name

961
01:20:57,786 --> 01:20:59,151
Sol, save the others first

962
01:22:05,887 --> 01:22:06,854
Master, leave these two to me

963
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:13,723
Mayor Barclay

964
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:18,859
What're the hell you're doing here?

965
01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:20,292
I need the rest of my money

966
01:22:22,337 --> 01:22:24,100
The other Chinese is suspicious
of me

967
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:25,865
I think I should leave town

968
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:28,807
I agree with you, you'd leave town

969
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:46,220
What do you want?

970
01:22:46,328 --> 01:22:47,556
I'm just doing business with you

971
01:22:47,696 --> 01:22:49,789
I want my four hundred thousand

972
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:51,925
That's the bank's money

973
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,695
You told me the job was gonna
a cake walk,

974
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:56,702
but one of my man's been killed

975
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:00,369
Sorry,
I've nothing to do with that

976
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:01,965
It was an accident

977
01:23:03,278 --> 01:23:04,302
I'm sorry too

978
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:26,531
Damn it!

979
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:36,770
Go to hell

980
01:23:44,986 --> 01:23:46,010
What the hell!

981
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,600
You little bastard,
how did you get there?

982
01:24:26,861 --> 01:24:27,555
Shit!

983
01:24:28,596 --> 01:24:29,824
What kind of a man is he?!

984
01:25:37,565 --> 01:25:38,088
This is for you!

985
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:52,037
Go in

986
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:06,724
Plays rough!

987
01:26:07,896 --> 01:26:08,624
I like that

988
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:48,466
You like that

989
01:26:49,437 --> 01:26:50,461
I don't think so

990
01:27:54,902 --> 01:27:55,630
Come on!

991
01:28:58,933 --> 01:29:00,491
Go, get out...

992
01:29:07,075 --> 01:29:39,899
get out...

993
01:29:40,007 --> 01:29:40,803
God damn it!

994
01:29:43,611 --> 01:29:44,873
Where are you?

995
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:49,645
Where are you?

996
01:30:01,262 --> 01:30:02,729
Come on out now,

997
01:30:03,631 --> 01:30:05,599
let's talk about that!

998
01:30:11,572 --> 01:30:12,402
That...

999
01:31:30,585 --> 01:31:31,210
Surrender now!

1000
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:36,786
You still fight?

1001
01:32:13,861 --> 01:32:15,852
What the hell are you?

1002
01:32:34,682 --> 01:32:35,979
Hold it tight!

1003
01:32:38,019 --> 01:32:40,112
Get off me, I don't need your help!

1004
01:32:40,988 --> 01:32:41,682
Come on up!

1005
01:32:41,822 --> 01:32:42,880
Come on up. Look out!

1006
01:33:04,712 --> 01:33:05,838
I need you to prove my innocence

1007
01:33:09,183 --> 01:33:10,150
You're not a human

1008
01:33:11,619 --> 01:33:12,244
Get up!

1009
01:33:26,701 --> 01:33:27,668
Are you alright?

1010
01:33:27,935 --> 01:33:28,959
Why are you guys here?

1011
01:33:29,704 --> 01:33:30,671
Oh, Diana!

1012
01:33:44,318 --> 01:33:45,444
Fai-hong, are you alright?

1013
01:33:45,653 --> 01:33:46,677
Where do you go?

1014
01:33:46,988 --> 01:33:48,250
I get them here to help you!

1015
01:33:48,689 --> 01:33:49,553
Who are they?

1016
01:33:49,857 --> 01:33:50,448
They are...

1017
01:33:50,725 --> 01:33:51,885
Forget it

1018
01:33:51,959 --> 01:33:52,926
People are hurt
Let's go help them

1019
01:34:23,624 --> 01:34:24,283
Seven, get ready for lion dance

1020
01:34:53,354 --> 01:34:54,048
Come here!

1021
01:35:07,168 --> 01:35:08,658
Congratulations, Billy

1022
01:35:09,437 --> 01:35:10,961
I trust you will be a good Mayor

1023
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:13,203
As a new Mayor,

1024
01:35:13,374 --> 01:35:16,502
I proclaim in name of friendship and
understanding that from this day on,

1025
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:20,647
this area of Fort Stockton will be
known as China Town

1026
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:26,787
I know you will be a good leader,

1027
01:35:26,887 --> 01:35:27,546
like Lincoln

1028
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:33,222
Farewell, Yellow

1029
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:34,660
I'm not Yellow

1030
01:35:35,496 --> 01:35:37,020
My name is Wong Fai-hong

1031
01:35:37,364 --> 01:35:38,490
A name is just a name

1032
01:35:39,433 --> 01:35:41,025
You'll always be our brother

1033
01:35:47,174 --> 01:35:48,038
Come on!

1034
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:53,710
Who are they?

1035
01:35:54,014 --> 01:35:55,538
Don't you remember them?

1036
01:36:08,629 --> 01:36:09,653
Everyone...

1037
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:11,163
Master Wong, no more speeches!

1038
01:36:11,298 --> 01:36:12,595
It's time to get going

1039
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:14,094
That's right,
if you miss this train,

1040
01:36:14,301 --> 01:36:15,359
you'll miss the boat as well

1041
01:36:15,569 --> 01:36:16,501
Now go

1042
01:36:17,071 --> 01:36:17,730
Yeah...

1043
01:36:19,206 --> 01:36:19,968
Seven!

1044
01:36:21,108 --> 01:36:22,336
Master,

1045
01:36:22,443 --> 01:36:23,967
didn't you have
a long speech readied?

1046
01:36:24,145 --> 01:36:25,112
How come you finish your speech
so soon?

1047
01:36:29,817 --> 01:36:30,875
Everyone...

1048
01:36:30,918 --> 01:36:32,146
Master Wong, please do go now

1049
01:36:32,286 --> 01:36:32,911
Get on the train

1050
01:36:32,987 --> 01:36:33,817
Let's go!

1051
01:36:33,921 --> 01:36:34,580
See you!

1052
01:36:34,755 --> 01:36:35,722
See you...

1053
01:36:38,893 --> 01:36:39,882
Here she is!

1054
01:36:40,761 --> 01:36:42,456
Master Wong, take care

1055
01:36:44,331 --> 01:36:45,298
How are you doing?

1056
01:36:47,067 --> 01:36:48,329
Who is that woman?

1057
01:36:51,505 --> 01:36:52,904
People say she's Uncle Lone's wife

1058
01:36:53,641 --> 01:36:54,767
Where the hell is it?

1059
01:36:54,909 --> 01:36:55,876
It's far from home!

1060
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:57,741
It's a nice place
It's a nice place!

1061
01:36:57,912 --> 01:36:58,537
Right!

1062
01:36:58,612 --> 01:36:59,840
I am tired!

1063
01:36:59,914 --> 01:37:00,812
I'll need at least 3 days' rest
before I can take care of you

1064
01:37:00,915 --> 01:37:02,109
No problem. As you wish

1065
01:37:02,183 --> 01:37:04,515
Why are they so happy?

1066
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:07,587
Happy!

1067
01:37:07,888 --> 01:37:09,150
No more than 10 people per day,

1068
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:10,518
and I break on the 1st and 15th

1069
01:37:10,624 --> 01:37:14,583
You really don't remember
the Indian woman?

1070
01:37:17,631 --> 01:37:18,859
No, I remember nothing!

1071
01:37:25,906 --> 01:37:26,873
See you!

1072
01:37:29,710 --> 01:37:30,870
No need to see me off, Sol,

1073
01:37:31,178 --> 01:37:32,008
go tend to the store

1074
01:37:32,179 --> 01:37:33,441
Good bye!
