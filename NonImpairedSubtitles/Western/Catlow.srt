1
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:13,638
MAN:
Ben cowan, when are you gonna learn?

2
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:17,013
That badge is only a target for trouble.

3
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,984
Yeah, and it found me.

4
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:21,614
Jedidiah?

5
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,281
Yeah?

6
00:07:25,495 --> 00:07:27,190
You're under arrest.

7
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,301
He's lost a sight of blood.

8
00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:43,737
Yeah, but he's still alive.

9
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:49,946
I sure hate to waste good liquor
on a dead man.

10
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,353
- Hi.
MERRIDEw: Hold your gabbing...

11
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:00,086
...and take a look at his leg.

12
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:01,628
How you feeling, Ben?

13
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:04,698
The same way as he looks. Lousy.

14
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:08,400
Maybe this whiskey
will be wasted after all.

15
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,402
oh, still, always was a gambling man.

16
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,904
Here.

17
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:19,746
oh, looks like that leg
might have to come off.

18
00:08:20,716 --> 00:08:23,378
oh, then again, it might not.

19
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,223
How is it when you're in trouble,
I get shot at?

20
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,093
cATLow:
I guess trouble likes company.

21
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:35,287
- Heh, heh, heh.
- Hand me your bottle.

22
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:38,660
You're gonna take it off at the hip?

23
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:41,428
Gonna take yours off at the neck.
Get me that hot iron.

24
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,037
Yeah.

25
00:08:57,053 --> 00:09:00,284
Never figured them Tonkawas
to have so much hide left in them.

26
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:03,254
- we're trespassing, remember?
- Tell the boys I'm making camp.

27
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,160
They ain't gonna like it.

28
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:07,762
Tell them.

29
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,766
we lost 20 miles, certain, today.

30
00:09:14,937 --> 00:09:17,235
And for what? A lawman.

31
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:19,533
MERRIDEw:
Don't let catlow hear you talk that way.

32
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:21,040
Ben cowan's a friend of his.

33
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,304
- They was in the war together.
- I don't give a damn.

34
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:27,213
we shouldn't have stopped here.

35
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,078
This place
is crawling with stinking Indians.

36
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:34,380
He don't have the right.

37
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:43,361
why don't you just turn in?

38
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:55,505
- Riders posted?
- Yep.

39
00:10:55,104 --> 00:10:56,901
Fever's broke.

40
00:10:57,707 --> 00:11:00,938
Be good as a $5 gold piece.

41
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:11,250
You lost a day's drive on account of me.

42
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,478
Gonna lose another.

43
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:15,216
Today you rest up.

44
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:18,593
Jed, you know I've got a warrant on you.

45
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,888
- Parkman?
- Yeah.

46
00:11:21,063 --> 00:11:22,087
Rustling?

47
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,697
Yeah.

48
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:26,899
Have you ever known me
to steaI from any man?

49
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:28,263
His wife maybe.

50
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:30,270
But you usually gave her back.

51
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,602
And I'll give back any steer
that has Parkman's brand on it.

52
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:34,834
Then why?

53
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,171
Ben, they're mavericks.

54
00:11:39,248 --> 00:11:41,011
Nobody owns them.

55
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:44,277
I reckon I have the same right
to brand them...

56
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,579
...as anybody else.

57
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:50,419
MAN: And I say
you're a damned no-good cow rustler.

58
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:55,326
Slow.

59
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:57,591
Slowly.

60
00:12:06,075 --> 00:12:07,702
Drop them.

61
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,469
orville Miller.

62
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:14,939
Parkman's bought himself the best.

63
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:17,347
MILLER:
only the best for catlow.

64
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,818
You've been stirring up a lot trouble,
mister.

65
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,719
Giving the other boys big ideas.

66
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:25,019
- How?
MILLER: Independent.

67
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:27,287
Mr. Parkman and his rancher friends...

68
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:31,399
...been talking about the independent ways
you got with their cattle.

69
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:32,591
Maverick cattle.

70
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:35,134
MILLER: well, you did a good job
rounding them up for us.

71
00:12:35,304 --> 00:12:37,033
Now, how good are you on a horse?

72
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,973
cATLow:
Good as the next man.

73
00:12:39,141 --> 00:12:41,336
MILLER:
You ain't heard the conditions.

74
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,674
You ride this bronc
with your hands tied behind your back...

75
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,078
...and your neck in that noose.

76
00:12:56,091 --> 00:12:58,924
I thought Parkman liked things legaI.

77
00:12:59,094 --> 00:13:00,721
MILLER:
There's a warrant out...

78
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:03,660
...but Mr. Parkman figures
your buddy, the marshaI...

79
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,666
...might not be able to find you.

80
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:10,297
Now,
if you're worried about getting a fair triaI...

81
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:12,373
...here's your jury.

82
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:15,409
And I'm the judge.

83
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:18,342
All those who reckon catlow here
is guilty of rustling...

84
00:13:18,514 --> 00:13:20,482
...raise your hands.

85
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:25,218
There's the verdict.

86
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,945
Now here's your sentence.

87
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,585
Hang him.

88
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:40,563
You said I was the best, catlow.

89
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,863
The sentence was hanging.

90
00:13:43,038 --> 00:13:44,767
Don't make me change it.

91
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,532
Now, get up there.

92
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:48,705
we got a herd to drive.

93
00:13:48,878 --> 00:13:52,575
Hell,
I always figured I'd die with my boots on.

94
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:28,639
MILLER:
Let's go. Let's go.

95
00:14:37,693 --> 00:14:39,160
MAN:
There's no way out of this.

96
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:41,159
You, come on.

97
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,093
MILLER:
come on.

98
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:48,995
First time I ever saw a man shot
with a boot.

99
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:53,831
You better get out of here fast.
You know Miller. He'll be back.

100
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:55,033
You can't ride.

101
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:58,043
In a wagon, I can.
They'll try to make that look like murder.

102
00:14:58,213 --> 00:15:01,740
- You've gotta disappear untiI I can square it.
- First, we'll sell the herd.

103
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:05,250
The boys and me got lots of calluses
rounding them up.

104
00:15:05,521 --> 00:15:07,853
All right, then,
but you better head off for Abilene now.

105
00:15:08,023 --> 00:15:09,615
MERRIDEw:
Yeah.

106
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:24,961
one thousand two hundred steers
on their way East...

107
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:27,967
...at $23 a head.

108
00:16:28,604 --> 00:16:31,596
That's a lot of dollars.
what do you figure on doing with it?

109
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:34,299
Stake money.
we've got another job to do.

110
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:36,137
Bartender.

111
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:40,110
whiskey for my fancy friend.

112
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,050
Jed,
you know it's my duty to take you in.

113
00:16:46,221 --> 00:16:48,416
Duty? You mean,
I gotta prove to 12 idiots...

114
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,057
...that I didn't do what I didn't do?

115
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:52,659
The law don't work against a man.
It works for him.

116
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:54,821
Are you sure, Ben?

117
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,391
oh, the hell with it.

118
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:02,560
If you were guilty I'd do it,
but they'll send you to Fort Smith.

119
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:04,501
Parkman's got the judge in his pocket.

120
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:08,131
I'm buying you the best supper
this place can offer with the best wine.

121
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,369
After that arrest me.
Take me to Fort Smith.

122
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:12,946
- The hell I will.
- It's your duty to bring me in.

123
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,982
You wouldn't know duty
if it reared up and bit you in the ass.

124
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:18,449
You leave out of here now,
I couldn't follow you.

125
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,420
It's my leg.
My leg is just paining me something terrible.

126
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:23,751
oh, Ben.

127
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:25,951
Are you trying to wreck your reputation?

128
00:17:28,263 --> 00:17:31,460
It's funny though. I gotta traveI for days
in a stinking hot stage...

129
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,466
...with a gamy-legged lawman,
and for what?

130
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:36,936
MAN:
Hey.

131
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,140
Hey. Hey.

132
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:54,315
How far is it...

133
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:58,518
...from Tucson to the Mexican border?

134
00:17:58,694 --> 00:18:02,095
oh, it's about 60 miles down to Nogales.

135
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:06,132
You figure on going down there?

136
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:10,799
could be.

137
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:20,937
I think I'll play these.

138
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:23,914
Heh, heh. come on, you're bluffing.

139
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:29,915
No, you're not.

140
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:37,529
Young man,
that is a sign of a misspent youth.

141
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:39,661
Yes, ma'am.

142
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:41,695
I drink hard liquor too.

143
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:45,699
I'm not surprised.

144
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:52,242
Did I tell you I'm on my way
to my granddaughter's wedding?

145
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,482
Yes, ma'am.

146
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:01,346
Just 41 years ago...

147
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:05,755
...I was married
carrying this same prayer book.

148
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:45,024
Hey, what in hell is-?

149
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,293
Don't move, I'll blow your brains out.

150
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:48,595
- was that right?
- Heh, heh.

151
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,294
Yes, couldn't be better, ma'am.

152
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,664
cowAN:
The brakes.

153
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,025
The man's a killer
and you let him escape.

154
00:20:11,193 --> 00:20:12,421
His men jumped us.

155
00:20:12,594 --> 00:20:14,528
The way your man, Miller,
jumped catlow.

156
00:20:14,696 --> 00:20:16,664
- Now, just a-
- I was there.

157
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:27,301
And if I was marshaI of this town,
I'd run you in for attempted murder.

158
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,706
Rustling's a hanging matter, Ben.

159
00:20:29,878 --> 00:20:31,937
These gentlemen have lost a lot of cattle.

160
00:20:32,114 --> 00:20:35,515
They weren't theirs to lose. They were
unbranded mavericks rounded up...

161
00:20:35,684 --> 00:20:37,276
...on land we ain't yet took.

162
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:39,010
This man's a troublemaker.

163
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:42,179
My men won't round up mavericks now
unless than I pay them bonus.

164
00:20:42,357 --> 00:20:45,656
- Yeah, I told them to go to hell.
- That's why you wanna get catlow?

165
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,022
Because you're gonna have
to start paying wages?

166
00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:50,289
RooTS:
The warrant still stands.

167
00:20:53,035 --> 00:20:55,469
well, well, well.

168
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:59,671
Seems like dollars and cents
will buy most anything around here.

169
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:01,666
MarshaI.

170
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,009
The way I heard it...

171
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:08,775
...a man breaks custody, it's the duty
of any honest citizen to bring him in.

172
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:10,384
Right.

173
00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:12,019
Alive or dead.

174
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,087
I'll bring him in.

175
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,085
Alive.

176
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,192
woMAN:
oh, shut up.

177
00:21:27,602 --> 00:21:30,969
All right, I'll talk to him.

178
00:21:35,344 --> 00:21:38,245
- They say that if-
- Tell them not a chance.

179
00:21:38,413 --> 00:21:39,471
You understand?

180
00:21:39,648 --> 00:21:40,876
Enough.

181
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:44,712
Tell them no one leaves
untiI they get word from Sanchez.

182
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,854
But in- But in Hermosillo,
my father has a secret place.

183
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:55,296
And upstairs there is a great big bed.

184
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:56,488
ow.

185
00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:57,996
No, no, no.

186
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:01,533
we stick to our timetable.
Now, go on, tell them.

187
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:06,434
Jedidiah, they're gonna make us
a lot of trouble.

188
00:22:07,843 --> 00:22:10,107
well, they're the best you could find.

189
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,939
They say
they will only stay one more night.

190
00:22:16,852 --> 00:22:18,217
Three cards.

191
00:23:34,463 --> 00:23:36,761
what makes you think he's in Mexico?

192
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:38,991
You got the badge.

193
00:23:39,367 --> 00:23:40,698
I'II let you do the thinking.

194
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:42,827
How much is Parkman paying you?

195
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:44,837
Enough.

196
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,132
oh?

197
00:23:46,308 --> 00:23:49,038
He must want catlow reaI bad.

198
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:53,141
I want catlow reaI bad.

199
00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:58,719
Miller, let me give you a little warning.
It's my job to bring him in for triaI.

200
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:00,349
Don't get in my way.

201
00:25:23,238 --> 00:25:24,330
cATLow:
Be carefuI.

202
00:25:24,506 --> 00:25:26,371
what the hell?

203
00:25:28,176 --> 00:25:29,575
what?

204
00:25:41,489 --> 00:25:44,822
SARA: This is the best bathtub
in the whole of Nogales.

205
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:52,528
After so long a journey,
you need a bath, huh?

206
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:54,760
Just get the rest of the water
and get out.

207
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:58,466
Si, senor, it is in the hall.

208
00:26:19,361 --> 00:26:20,919
Leave it.

209
00:26:23,198 --> 00:26:26,759
A man always feels good after a bath.

210
00:26:26,935 --> 00:26:30,496
Then I will give to you a nice massage.

211
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,139
Get out.

212
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:35,208
But you will like it, senor.

213
00:26:35,377 --> 00:26:39,279
And after, you will sleep like a baby.

214
00:26:39,447 --> 00:26:40,914
I never sleep.

215
00:27:01,636 --> 00:27:04,799
Tell Mama to bring us something to eat,
huh?

216
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:14,979
Thank you, Louis.

217
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,408
Here you go.

218
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:20,112
You still got that warrant?

219
00:27:20,288 --> 00:27:21,312
Two.

220
00:27:21,489 --> 00:27:23,514
one for jumping arrest.

221
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:26,252
You stirred up some kind of a hornet's nest
back there.

222
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:29,761
And that Miller,
he's packing a lot of heat.

223
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:31,125
Think I can't handle him?

224
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:34,166
well, if somebody shoots you,
let's keep it in the family.

225
00:27:34,336 --> 00:27:37,032
I'm gonna bring you in
before he carries you in.

226
00:27:37,205 --> 00:27:40,470
There's a derringer looking at you
says you don't.

227
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:42,707
oh?

228
00:27:43,378 --> 00:27:47,246
cATLow: I'd hate to shoot that badge
off you just to prove it.

229
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:50,213
Yeah, well, that's not where I wear it.

230
00:27:52,821 --> 00:27:55,221
You know it would bust my heart
to have to kill you.

231
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,550
Yeah, well...

232
00:27:56,725 --> 00:27:58,556
Hey, why don't you ride with us.

233
00:27:58,727 --> 00:28:00,456
I need someone I can count on.

234
00:28:00,628 --> 00:28:01,652
oh, Jed.

235
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,457
The gold is just Iying there.

236
00:28:03,965 --> 00:28:05,262
- Gold?
- Yeah.

237
00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:09,664
- Gold is why you came-?
- Yeah.

238
00:28:10,538 --> 00:28:14,065
Jed, are you gonna tangle with the law
the rest of your life?

239
00:28:14,242 --> 00:28:16,608
You have brawled and drunk
and catted your way...

240
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,439
...through every state in the west.

241
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,638
I have gotten you out of jaiI
so many times.

242
00:28:20,815 --> 00:28:22,009
when are you gonna learn?

243
00:28:22,183 --> 00:28:23,445
Ben, it's maverick gold.

244
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,950
It belongs to anyone
who can round it up.

245
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,748
It don't belong to you.

246
00:28:27,922 --> 00:28:31,517
You can't steaI from a man
just because you don't know his name.

247
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,926
oh, well, I never thought you would.

248
00:28:36,531 --> 00:28:38,556
Yeah, I was.

249
00:28:48,676 --> 00:28:50,007
Um...

250
00:28:50,412 --> 00:28:52,676
You wouldn't be
just shooting off your mouth...

251
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:55,475
...about that gun under there?

252
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:00,178
Make one wrong move,
and that's not all I'll be shooting off.

253
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:08,258
oh, that looks just wonderfuI.

254
00:29:24,045 --> 00:29:27,242
It's okay, Sanchez, don't let the badge
scare you. Pick up your food.

255
00:29:27,415 --> 00:29:31,215
Up on your feet, nice and easy.

256
00:29:31,753 --> 00:29:34,051
Have a drink, I'll be right back.

257
00:29:35,723 --> 00:29:38,021
Now you believe about the gun?

258
00:29:48,636 --> 00:29:50,467
okay, Sanchez is here.

259
00:29:50,638 --> 00:29:51,696
we're pulling out.

260
00:30:01,483 --> 00:30:02,541
what about him?

261
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,651
You'll stay with him.

262
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:08,778
I'm your woman.
You don't give me away to no man.

263
00:30:08,957 --> 00:30:09,981
Do as I say.

264
00:30:10,158 --> 00:30:12,820
No, I do as I say.

265
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,295
oh, all right.

266
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:18,432
I guess Sara will have to work overtime.

267
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,659
Tell her to get back here.

268
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,436
You know, Ben,
I'd still like you in with me.

269
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,339
You'd be worth that whole crowd.

270
00:30:33,515 --> 00:30:34,846
It's gonna be easy.

271
00:30:35,016 --> 00:30:37,541
They're moving the stuff by mule train.

272
00:30:46,628 --> 00:30:48,493
cowAN:
Forgotten Miller?

273
00:30:49,397 --> 00:30:50,887
No.

274
00:31:09,817 --> 00:31:11,944
Stay the hell out.

275
00:31:17,525 --> 00:31:19,652
I understand
you're looking for more hot water.

276
00:31:22,397 --> 00:31:23,955
Get up.

277
00:31:34,943 --> 00:31:37,537
Never figured you to be bashfuI.

278
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,644
RoSITA:
Hey.

279
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,679
cATLow:
come on, baby, we traveI.

280
00:32:53,488 --> 00:32:55,513
The sun will be coming out.

281
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,817
Let's camp here.

282
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:06,600
we camp here.

283
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,132
I'll scout for water.

284
00:33:10,538 --> 00:33:12,165
RoSITA:
come on.

285
00:34:15,336 --> 00:34:18,737
MAN:
Stay exactly like you are, Jed.

286
00:34:28,716 --> 00:34:30,411
cATLow:
Ben.

287
00:34:30,885 --> 00:34:32,819
You sneaky old-

288
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,020
I mean it, Jed.

289
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,181
cATLow:
Ben, you know I've got a bad back.

290
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:40,452
cowAN:
oh, well, then don't straighten up...

291
00:34:40,628 --> 00:34:44,826
...because I'd sure hate to have to
put a hole in your, uh, self-esteem.

292
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,527
Now, let's make this fast.

293
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:49,693
Take your right hand
and put it on that rock in front of you.

294
00:34:49,871 --> 00:34:53,602
All right, now unbuckle your gun belt
with your left hand.

295
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,302
You're a hard man, Ben.

296
00:34:57,879 --> 00:34:59,744
Now kick it away.

297
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:04,178
Ah-ah-ah. No, no, no. Kick it my way.

298
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,045
Now can I bend up?

299
00:35:08,222 --> 00:35:14,559
Just as soon as you raise your right foot
and pull that boot off with your left hand.

300
00:35:14,729 --> 00:35:16,026
That's damn foolish.

301
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,858
Just do it.

302
00:35:25,673 --> 00:35:28,699
Now turn it upside down.

303
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,842
well, look there.

304
00:35:34,015 --> 00:35:35,277
How did you know?

305
00:35:35,449 --> 00:35:37,246
I once saw a man shot with a boot.

306
00:35:38,586 --> 00:35:41,453
Now I want you to walk straight ahead.
Just about 10 feet.

307
00:35:41,622 --> 00:35:42,953
oh, ah-

308
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,415
Down on all fours.

309
00:35:44,592 --> 00:35:45,889
- what?
- Move.

310
00:35:51,098 --> 00:35:53,589
Ben, nobody will believe this.

311
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:54,928
No way.

312
00:35:55,102 --> 00:35:56,262
Then don't tell them.

313
00:35:56,437 --> 00:35:57,995
Move.

314
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:03,134
All right, that's far enough.

315
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:05,472
Just stay right there like that.

316
00:36:11,052 --> 00:36:13,145
Ben, I thought we were friends.

317
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:14,515
oh, well, we are.

318
00:36:14,689 --> 00:36:16,953
Sure, we're still friends.

319
00:36:17,124 --> 00:36:20,491
But friends ain't supposed to make
no trouble for other friends, right?

320
00:36:20,661 --> 00:36:21,889
MAN:
That's right, marshaI.

321
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,963
- Yes, senor.
- Yeah.

322
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:28,101
Yes, yes.

323
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:35,539
Uh, heh, heh.

324
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:17,644
Miller, get me out of this.

325
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,033
Damned rattler shot back.

326
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:47,007
Ride.

327
00:38:47,174 --> 00:38:48,573
MAN:
Hyah!

328
00:41:04,912 --> 00:41:05,936
what happened?

329
00:41:07,348 --> 00:41:11,284
My soldiers, I was ahead of them.

330
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,681
Apaches.

331
00:41:20,928 --> 00:41:23,328
we better move out of here quick.

332
00:41:24,598 --> 00:41:25,826
come on.

333
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:27,991
Easy.

334
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:29,693
Easy.

335
00:44:15,602 --> 00:44:17,570
I've killed you.

336
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:25,106
I ask your forgiveness
in the name of God.

337
00:44:28,015 --> 00:44:30,483
I'd probably run into them anyway.

338
00:44:42,463 --> 00:44:43,896
come on.

339
00:46:30,737 --> 00:46:32,728
REcALDE SPEAKING IN SPANISH]

340
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,538
They're stuck with survivors.

341
00:46:35,309 --> 00:46:37,106
They're stuck with survivors.

342
00:46:37,277 --> 00:46:38,869
My men.

343
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,537
They're stuck with survivors.

344
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:42,909
Survivors!

345
00:47:48,815 --> 00:47:50,305
Shut up.

346
00:47:51,151 --> 00:47:52,880
Rlo:
open up.

347
00:47:54,922 --> 00:47:56,048
where's catlow?

348
00:47:56,223 --> 00:47:57,884
where do you think?

349
00:47:58,692 --> 00:48:01,786
- Sure beats riding a horse all night.
- Yeah.

350
00:48:09,069 --> 00:48:11,697
That's a good way to get yourself killed.

351
00:48:16,043 --> 00:48:19,535
The mule train's due in tomorrow morning.
Twenty cavalry, two officers.

352
00:48:20,581 --> 00:48:22,344
No problem.

353
00:48:22,516 --> 00:48:23,642
Get some sleep.

354
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,614
Up in that stinking hole?

355
00:48:25,786 --> 00:48:29,051
- we've been up there for a week.
- well, there ain't any room in here.

356
00:49:10,631 --> 00:49:12,690
cowAN:
Good morning, generaI.

357
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,232
Ah, good morning.

358
00:49:15,402 --> 00:49:17,063
come down.

359
00:49:25,412 --> 00:49:28,108
You're awake early this morning.

360
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,842
Don't you mean at last?

361
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,444
I've been sleeping the clock around.

362
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:38,717
You've been in my house only a week,
and already, you've found me out.

363
00:49:39,092 --> 00:49:41,652
My roses are my passion.

364
00:49:41,828 --> 00:49:43,989
- And I wanted to keep it a secret.
- Hmm.

365
00:49:44,164 --> 00:49:46,029
Like the gold?

366
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,924
The gold?

367
00:49:48,101 --> 00:49:51,229
Yeah, the gold that's being shipped
by mule train.

368
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:56,541
My nephew and all of us
are profoundly gratefuI to you...

369
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:57,768
...for saving his life.

370
00:49:58,145 --> 00:50:01,205
- But that is no reason why-
- No, that- GeneraI, he didn't-

371
00:50:01,381 --> 00:50:02,746
He didn't tell me.

372
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,042
I heard it before.

373
00:50:04,217 --> 00:50:08,984
Senor, you must tell me
how you have this information.

374
00:50:09,456 --> 00:50:11,481
I will, generaI. Yeah, I'II...

375
00:50:11,658 --> 00:50:14,252
I'll tell you if you tell me it's true.

376
00:50:17,731 --> 00:50:18,755
It is true.

377
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:22,333
It was found recently in a high cave
near the casas Grandes.

378
00:50:23,336 --> 00:50:26,362
oh, that's not far from the Texas border.

379
00:50:27,574 --> 00:50:29,940
- Do you know who it belongs to?
- I'm sorry.

380
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,907
I cannot say more.

381
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:39,613
well, it don't seem likely
that somebody would just go off...

382
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:42,721
...and leave a pile of gold
laying around a cave.

383
00:50:42,889 --> 00:50:47,383
There would be no reason to hide it there,
unless maybe that gold was stolen.

384
00:50:47,561 --> 00:50:49,085
Your logic is impeccable.

385
00:50:49,262 --> 00:50:52,322
- Has the Mexican government lost any gold?
- To the contrary.

386
00:50:52,499 --> 00:50:54,831
oh, back in '62,
our confederate Army did.

387
00:50:55,001 --> 00:50:57,834
our supply base at Santa Fe
was attacked by the Yankees...

388
00:50:58,205 --> 00:51:03,233
They made off with a fresh shipment
from the gold fields about $2 million worth.

389
00:51:03,677 --> 00:51:04,701
Heh, heh.

390
00:51:04,878 --> 00:51:08,006
Now, it just might be that that gold
headed South instead of North.

391
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:10,149
All this I find fascinating.

392
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:14,048
And if it could be proved that this gold
belongs to the American government...

393
00:51:14,221 --> 00:51:15,848
...I am sure it would be returned.

394
00:51:16,256 --> 00:51:18,156
Yeah, unless something happen
to it first.

395
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,088
Nothing will.

396
00:51:21,261 --> 00:51:23,661
well, generaI,
I hate to disagree with you.

397
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,890
But you see,
there's a man called catlow.

398
00:51:27,067 --> 00:51:28,091
MAN:
open up.

399
00:51:29,569 --> 00:51:31,093
what is it?

400
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:39,139
open up.

401
00:51:51,792 --> 00:51:53,987
PESQUIERA: I know you have come
for the saddle. It's ready.

402
00:51:54,161 --> 00:51:55,685
It's beautifuI.

403
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:58,456
cHRISTINA:
I am anxious to see it.

404
00:51:59,933 --> 00:52:03,562
PESQUIERA: I'm very proud of it.
I'm sure you will like it.

405
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,135
It's the work of an artist.

406
00:52:08,308 --> 00:52:10,674
PESQUIERA: Thank you, thank you.
It's very kind of you to say.

407
00:52:10,844 --> 00:52:12,835
cHRISTINA: Armando will bring you
the money tomorrow.

408
00:52:13,013 --> 00:52:15,243
Thank you, thank you.

409
00:52:18,518 --> 00:52:19,542
Some lady.

410
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:22,279
cHRISTINA: The work of an artist.
- Lady? Ha.

411
00:52:22,455 --> 00:52:25,083
All you see are two expensive asses.

412
00:52:33,533 --> 00:52:35,194
what did I do? I only looked at her.

413
00:52:35,368 --> 00:52:39,361
RafaeI Vargas could cut your throat.
He's more jealous than I am.

414
00:52:41,274 --> 00:52:45,267
who's RafaeI Vargas, huh?
who's RafaeI Vargas, huh?

415
00:52:45,445 --> 00:52:48,039
If he knew she will be
at the generaI's ball tonight...

416
00:52:48,215 --> 00:52:49,978
...dancing with officers...

417
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:52,482
Tonight? what officers?

418
00:52:52,652 --> 00:52:55,780
All of them from the barracks.

419
00:52:55,956 --> 00:52:56,980
But not Vargas?

420
00:52:57,157 --> 00:53:01,856
No, stupido, he's the officer in charge
of the mule train.

421
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,824
REcALDE:
Good morning, Ben.

422
00:53:42,769 --> 00:53:44,600
cowAN:
what the hell are you doing out of bed?

423
00:53:44,771 --> 00:53:47,103
REcALDE:
I have been in bed long enough.

424
00:53:47,274 --> 00:53:50,641
I have no intention
of missing my uncle's ball tonight.

425
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:54,337
And most of all,
I wanted to see your face.

426
00:53:54,514 --> 00:53:55,606
My face?

427
00:53:57,017 --> 00:53:58,211
come.

428
00:54:16,803 --> 00:54:19,237
This is my friend, Ben cowan.

429
00:54:19,406 --> 00:54:21,670
My cousin, christina calderon.

430
00:54:22,609 --> 00:54:25,578
- Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
REcALDE: An impossible woman.

431
00:54:25,745 --> 00:54:29,545
Too clever, too rich, too beautifuI,
and with a mind of her own.

432
00:54:29,716 --> 00:54:31,650
God gave minds to women too, Diego.

433
00:54:31,818 --> 00:54:33,251
That's true.

434
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:37,151
I hope that you won't mind
escorting christina to the ball tonight.

435
00:54:37,324 --> 00:54:38,882
My leg.

436
00:54:39,059 --> 00:54:41,619
- Be my pleasure.
REcALDE: As long as you don't tell Vargas...

437
00:54:41,795 --> 00:54:43,194
...when he arrives tomorrow.

438
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:47,197
- RafaeI is only interested in his mules.
- who are much easier to handle.

439
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,267
oh, Diego.

440
00:54:49,436 --> 00:54:51,097
Armando?

441
00:54:52,172 --> 00:54:55,733
- She is the best?
- on the whole Rancho calderon.

442
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,705
She's yours.

443
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:01,938
with my thanks.

444
00:55:10,757 --> 00:55:13,248
This saddle is a gift from the family.

445
00:55:13,426 --> 00:55:15,621
we are gratefuI for what you've done.

446
00:55:15,795 --> 00:55:18,559
what are you waiting for? Try her.

447
00:55:18,832 --> 00:55:19,924
I'll race you.

448
00:55:29,009 --> 00:55:32,376
In the name of God, don't let her win.

449
00:57:17,617 --> 00:57:19,710
A message for you, captain.

450
00:57:27,393 --> 00:57:28,417
Anything else?

451
00:57:28,595 --> 00:57:32,463
Senorita christina says that she hopes
you will arrive in time for the ball tonight.

452
00:57:32,632 --> 00:57:35,260
She will save all her dances
untiI the last moment.

453
00:57:36,302 --> 00:57:37,667
Tell her I shall do my best.

454
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,327
Diego.

455
00:59:15,501 --> 00:59:17,162
Your uncle gives some party.

456
00:59:17,337 --> 00:59:18,668
You'll enjoy it.

457
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,030
My uncle has the first dance.

458
00:59:21,207 --> 00:59:24,699
But for the rest,
I'm sure they can all be yours.

459
00:59:45,531 --> 00:59:48,295
- You take over. There is no danger now.
- Yes, sir.

460
00:59:48,468 --> 00:59:49,799
Hyah!

461
01:00:42,955 --> 01:00:46,254
well, your beautifuI cousin
has become a reaI woman.

462
01:00:46,426 --> 01:00:49,759
I have never seen her
look at a man that way before.

463
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:54,298
But I don't think I understand.

464
01:00:55,468 --> 01:01:01,964
well, you see,
all I own is a couple of guns and a tin star.

465
01:01:02,342 --> 01:01:05,072
of course,
a beautifuI new horse and a saddle.

466
01:01:05,945 --> 01:01:10,211
Is that how you judge the worth of a man?
By how much he owns?

467
01:01:11,784 --> 01:01:13,081
oh, no, ma'am.

468
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:15,743
I don't mean that. No, I just...

469
01:03:12,438 --> 01:03:13,666
MERRIDEw:
Get him back.

470
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:02,847
christina.

471
01:04:03,122 --> 01:04:04,453
oh, RafaeI.

472
01:04:05,825 --> 01:04:06,883
Thank you a hundred times.

473
01:04:07,059 --> 01:04:09,254
I came as quickly as I could.

474
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:11,760
- But your mules.
VARGAS: I couldn't wait.

475
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:13,296
I came ahead.

476
01:04:14,033 --> 01:04:15,500
oh, excuse me.

477
01:04:15,668 --> 01:04:19,104
May I introduce captain RafaeI-

478
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,739
Vargas.

479
01:04:22,308 --> 01:04:24,708
cHRISTINA:
This is MarshaI Ben co-

480
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:00,805
Here comes the last one.

481
01:05:29,709 --> 01:05:30,801
The mule train.

482
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:38,176
Tie him up.

483
01:05:47,493 --> 01:05:49,757
oh, no.

484
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:28,590
RoSITA:
where's catlow?

485
01:06:28,768 --> 01:06:32,295
They were shooting back there.
we best keep on going. whoa.

486
01:06:32,471 --> 01:06:34,405
we should have time
to get to my shop.

487
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:36,063
No way I'm heading back to your place.

488
01:06:37,443 --> 01:06:39,138
RoSITA:
Hey, what you mean?

489
01:06:40,479 --> 01:06:42,106
PESQUIERA:
catlow, always we planned.

490
01:06:42,281 --> 01:06:43,942
You planned. I've got a better plan.

491
01:06:44,116 --> 01:06:48,052
Now, you keep those mules moving,
or we'll have those asses full of lead.

492
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:50,120
You said we would go
to my father's shop.

493
01:06:50,289 --> 01:06:51,620
cATLow:
You will.

494
01:06:51,791 --> 01:06:54,919
- Jed-
- Stay home and keep cowan off our necks.

495
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,187
- Get down.
- Listen, Jed, that's American gold.

496
01:06:57,363 --> 01:07:00,491
I don't give a damn whose gold it was.
Now it's ours.

497
01:07:00,666 --> 01:07:03,157
- I said get down.
- oh.

498
01:07:03,335 --> 01:07:06,964
You used me,
my father's house, my bed, my men.

499
01:07:07,139 --> 01:07:08,629
cATLow:
You want your share?

500
01:07:08,808 --> 01:07:11,333
- Make sure that he stays put.
- That gold's going back.

501
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:12,772
cATLow:
You gotta find me first.

502
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:15,641
I'll be seeing you, senorita.

503
01:07:15,981 --> 01:07:17,414
when you do, I'll kill you.

504
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:18,845
You are no good.

505
01:07:19,018 --> 01:07:20,918
And I'll do better than Miller.

506
01:07:39,205 --> 01:07:40,934
Ride through.

507
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,130
come on, come on, come on.

508
01:07:43,609 --> 01:07:45,201
Keep moving.

509
01:07:45,711 --> 01:07:47,474
okay, the irrigation canaI.

510
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:49,113
- open the sluice gate.
- what for?

511
01:07:49,281 --> 01:07:53,240
- You'll flood the whole damn orchard.
- That's right, stupid. come on.

512
01:08:07,433 --> 01:08:09,230
come on.

513
01:08:19,078 --> 01:08:23,208
- Head for the mountains. I'll follow.
- Ah- oh.

514
01:08:45,437 --> 01:08:46,904
cATLow:
Hey.

515
01:09:31,884 --> 01:09:33,374
Hold it.

516
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,278
He's coming with us.

517
01:09:36,455 --> 01:09:39,390
- A stinking Indian?
- Shut up, he's a friend.

518
01:09:39,558 --> 01:09:42,220
If you want to get across
that desert alive...

519
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:43,619
what desert?

520
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:09,087
All right, bunch them up. Keep moving.

521
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:17,251
MERRIDEw:
Hey, that Indian did all right.

522
01:10:17,429 --> 01:10:20,830
Fresh mules, food, water.

523
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,695
Rlo:
Just don't turn your back on him.

524
01:10:22,868 --> 01:10:25,336
why don't you shut up, Rio.

525
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:38,143
well, there they go.

526
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:41,775
Like Rio said, what desert?

527
01:10:41,954 --> 01:10:45,720
Didn't you tell me you went down
to Rio Asuncion at one time?

528
01:10:45,891 --> 01:10:47,916
You ain't figuring on going on that route?

529
01:10:48,093 --> 01:10:50,687
we got water for 40 miles, no more.

530
01:10:50,863 --> 01:10:52,558
By then, we'll hit Rio Baccachi.

531
01:10:53,432 --> 01:10:55,161
And if it's dry?

532
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:56,528
chaco says it won't be.

533
01:10:56,702 --> 01:10:58,294
But if it is, you got big trouble.

534
01:10:58,470 --> 01:11:01,701
Those Mexis ain't gonna stand for this.

535
01:11:01,974 --> 01:11:04,204
You trust that Indian?

536
01:11:05,077 --> 01:11:06,874
As well as I trust you.

537
01:11:07,046 --> 01:11:09,537
In that desert, I wouldn't trust no one.

538
01:11:09,715 --> 01:11:11,205
Especially me.

539
01:11:54,927 --> 01:11:57,122
Now, wait,
I don't wanna have to hit a lady.

540
01:12:03,502 --> 01:12:05,231
what the-?

541
01:12:26,392 --> 01:12:29,122
RoSITA:
oh, I'll get you.

542
01:12:46,378 --> 01:12:47,436
cHRISTINA:
where have you been?

543
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:49,945
- we've been searching for you.
- I'll explain later.

544
01:12:50,115 --> 01:12:51,514
I gotta stop catlow.

545
01:12:51,683 --> 01:12:53,378
Ben, wait.

546
01:12:53,552 --> 01:12:54,917
I'm coming with you.

547
01:12:55,087 --> 01:12:57,419
- christina, please stay here.
- I'm coming with you.

548
01:12:57,589 --> 01:12:58,783
cowAN:
christina, listen to me.

549
01:12:58,957 --> 01:13:01,391
I don't take orders from anyone.
I'll get my horse.

550
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,289
christina.

551
01:13:17,076 --> 01:13:19,670
He said they went southwest.

552
01:13:20,746 --> 01:13:23,146
well, the lad says
the mules went that way.

553
01:13:23,882 --> 01:13:25,873
cHRISTINA:
That leads straight into the desert.

554
01:13:26,051 --> 01:13:29,248
only a fooI would take that route.

555
01:13:29,421 --> 01:13:33,221
Nobody ever said anything
about catlow being in his right mind.

556
01:13:33,792 --> 01:13:36,784
we call that desert El Infierno sin Llamas.

557
01:13:36,962 --> 01:13:38,953
Hell with the fire out.

558
01:13:39,131 --> 01:13:41,429
He may not come out alive.

559
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:44,935
Please don't go.

560
01:13:48,073 --> 01:13:51,201
Somebody has gotta ride herd
on mavericks like catlow.

561
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:00,041
come back.

562
01:14:46,465 --> 01:14:48,956
MERRIDEw:
That's your Baccachi, dry.

563
01:14:49,601 --> 01:14:51,330
Get the men digging.

564
01:14:51,503 --> 01:14:53,767
You're plumb crazy.

565
01:14:56,375 --> 01:14:57,467
cATLow:
He smells water.

566
01:14:58,177 --> 01:14:59,872
Feels it.

567
01:15:04,383 --> 01:15:07,250
Grab your shovels and start digging.

568
01:15:07,419 --> 01:15:08,443
Rlo:
For what?

569
01:15:09,354 --> 01:15:12,380
- For what?
- chaco says there's water out there.

570
01:15:12,558 --> 01:15:14,082
And you believe him?

571
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:17,820
It's because of your Indian friend,
we're stuck in this desert with no water.

572
01:15:17,996 --> 01:15:19,759
we should have gone straight to Texas.

573
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:22,059
with half the Mexican cavalry
chasing after us?

574
01:15:22,234 --> 01:15:25,294
You know, for a smart boy like you, Rio,
you're just plain dumb.

575
01:15:26,538 --> 01:15:28,301
Now get a shoveI and start digging.

576
01:15:47,526 --> 01:15:48,652
MERRIDEw:
water!

577
01:15:49,328 --> 01:15:51,193
water!

578
01:15:57,436 --> 01:15:59,597
water!

579
01:15:59,771 --> 01:16:01,500
water!

580
01:16:28,267 --> 01:16:30,531
There's gonna be trouble.

581
01:16:31,503 --> 01:16:32,993
Rio?

582
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:35,139
He's been with me near
as long as you have.

583
01:16:35,307 --> 01:16:37,867
I'm segundo, second,
and that's the way I like it.

584
01:16:38,043 --> 01:16:39,908
But he's hankering to be first.

585
01:16:58,163 --> 01:17:00,154
what's he carrying on about?

586
01:17:00,332 --> 01:17:01,356
Indians up ahead.

587
01:17:01,533 --> 01:17:03,364
The Seris, and he's scared.

588
01:17:05,103 --> 01:17:06,570
MERRIDEw:
well, we can't go back.

589
01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:09,507
Unless you wanna take on
the Mexican army.

590
01:17:09,675 --> 01:17:12,269
I'd feeI a whole lot safer.

591
01:17:13,578 --> 01:17:15,637
All right. Mount up.

592
01:18:13,705 --> 01:18:18,438
If there's anything or anyone out there,
our Indian will find them.

593
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:20,840
How much further we gotta go?

594
01:18:21,346 --> 01:18:22,574
Till we get there.

595
01:18:25,283 --> 01:18:28,878
well, some of us reckon
we ought to make for the pedradas.

596
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:43,990
well, that's what the Mexican army expects
us to do. we'll be walking into a trap.

597
01:18:44,169 --> 01:18:47,570
But we talked it over, and we've had
enough of being short of water.

598
01:18:47,739 --> 01:18:51,869
And we decided we stand a better chance
if we make for the pedradas.

599
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:10,894
I guess if you have decided,
then we ought to make the share out...

600
01:19:11,062 --> 01:19:13,030
...and you go on your own way.

601
01:19:17,969 --> 01:19:20,836
Except for one thing.

602
01:19:21,606 --> 01:19:23,699
The Seris out there.

603
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:26,673
Split up now, and we're dead, all of us.

604
01:19:27,112 --> 01:19:29,876
Stick together, we stand a chance.

605
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:34,516
Since I don't reckon ending up
in some Indian's cooking pot...

606
01:19:35,086 --> 01:19:37,520
...I'll kill any man who tries to leave.

607
01:19:54,639 --> 01:19:58,769
well, no sense in shooting each other
full of holes...

608
01:19:58,944 --> 01:20:01,344
...just when we have a chance to be rich.

609
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:15,352
I thought Pesquiera
was in the back of me.

610
01:20:15,794 --> 01:20:17,591
MERRIDEw:
He was.

611
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:20,762
what happened?

612
01:20:20,932 --> 01:20:22,593
MERRIDEw:
He ran.

613
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:30,934
You get scratched, just scratched,
by a Seri arrow.

614
01:21:47,686 --> 01:21:48,812
All right, bunch up.

615
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:50,147
Keep moving.

616
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:51,448
Keep moving.

617
01:21:51,623 --> 01:21:53,181
Keep moving.

618
01:22:17,549 --> 01:22:18,675
Let's get out of here.

619
01:22:37,602 --> 01:22:39,069
Keep going.

620
01:23:17,742 --> 01:23:19,573
Thank God.

621
01:23:20,445 --> 01:23:22,276
we made it.

622
01:23:22,447 --> 01:23:24,745
we made it.

623
01:24:30,882 --> 01:24:32,315
I'll give the signaI.

624
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:34,315
wait for me.

625
01:24:51,202 --> 01:24:52,692
RoSITA:
officer.

626
01:24:58,209 --> 01:25:00,734
- come on.
MERRIDEw: Rosita. How did she get here?

627
01:25:00,912 --> 01:25:04,006
Through the traiI.
Horses are faster than mules.

628
01:25:18,229 --> 01:25:20,493
MAN: Go get them.
come on, get them, get them.

629
01:25:20,665 --> 01:25:22,929
RoSITA:
I'll kill you.

630
01:25:43,488 --> 01:25:45,353
Hold it, just put it down.

631
01:25:49,994 --> 01:25:51,018
come on.

632
01:25:55,033 --> 01:25:57,467
watch her jab.
She's got a punch like a mule.

633
01:25:57,635 --> 01:26:00,468
You, I should have killed in Hermosillo.

634
01:26:00,638 --> 01:26:03,038
cATLow: oh, you've just seen
the wrong side of her.

635
01:26:03,208 --> 01:26:05,039
ooh! ooh.

636
01:26:13,952 --> 01:26:17,285
Get a move on.
we ain't fresh out of Indians yet.

637
01:26:17,455 --> 01:26:21,448
oh, Ben, if you hadn't shot to warn us...

638
01:26:21,726 --> 01:26:23,557
what the hell
are you doing here anyway?

639
01:26:23,728 --> 01:26:27,061
well, I forget,
something about a- A warrant.

640
01:27:23,421 --> 01:27:25,616
come on, come on.

641
01:27:45,843 --> 01:27:48,505
- Here.
- Thanks.

642
01:27:52,884 --> 01:27:54,681
coffee?

643
01:27:54,852 --> 01:27:56,444
You better enjoy it.

644
01:27:56,621 --> 01:27:58,919
That's the last of the water.

645
01:27:59,557 --> 01:28:02,082
How about that hole
you've been digging?

646
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:05,190
well, nothing so far.

647
01:28:08,032 --> 01:28:12,833
All those Seri Indians out there
can wait for weeks.

648
01:28:13,004 --> 01:28:14,835
we can't.

649
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:17,174
Yeah.

650
01:28:22,780 --> 01:28:24,270
- Ben?
- Hm?

651
01:28:24,983 --> 01:28:27,417
How come you trailed us?

652
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:31,985
Nothing would make me
cross that desert.

653
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:35,484
Less than two million in gold, that is.

654
01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:36,991
Hmm.

655
01:28:37,895 --> 01:28:39,760
Me neither.

656
01:28:40,498 --> 01:28:43,331
Two million in stolen confederate gold.

657
01:28:43,501 --> 01:28:47,961
It belongs to the United States government,
that I'm taking back with me.

658
01:28:48,139 --> 01:28:50,835
oh, don't tell me.

659
01:28:54,312 --> 01:28:56,405
Tell the Seris.

660
01:30:27,305 --> 01:30:28,363
Ben, your gun.

661
01:30:31,342 --> 01:30:32,502
Huh?

662
01:30:32,677 --> 01:30:34,611
cATLow:
The guns, they've taken all the guns.

663
01:30:38,449 --> 01:30:40,781
where the hell are the guns?

664
01:30:42,019 --> 01:30:43,884
Rio.

665
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:50,084
Rio.

666
01:30:51,062 --> 01:30:52,893
Too smart to live.

667
01:30:56,601 --> 01:30:58,262
They don't stand a chance out there.

668
01:30:58,436 --> 01:31:00,495
Better than we do.

669
01:31:01,372 --> 01:31:02,464
cATLow:
She took your gun too?

670
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:03,732
Sure, I got slugged.

671
01:31:03,908 --> 01:31:06,968
And Sanchez and Alberto
went off with them.

672
01:31:10,181 --> 01:31:12,615
You said you'd kill any man
who tried to leave.

673
01:31:12,783 --> 01:31:15,115
well, I'm taking Rio's horse
and one of them mules.

674
01:31:15,286 --> 01:31:17,117
You're gonna try and stop me?

675
01:31:17,288 --> 01:31:19,722
- You'll never make it.
- I'll take my chances.

676
01:31:21,392 --> 01:31:22,950
Good luck.

677
01:32:48,412 --> 01:32:49,436
They're coming.

678
01:32:49,614 --> 01:32:51,741
They're coming.

679
01:33:13,170 --> 01:33:16,435
Yeah, well, they guessed
we've got no guns.

680
01:33:20,544 --> 01:33:21,909
Here.

681
01:33:22,913 --> 01:33:25,438
You ain't gonna kill many Seris with that.

682
01:33:25,616 --> 01:33:29,848
You said, if I ever get killed,
let's keep it in the family.

683
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:31,682
It's for us.

684
01:33:40,431 --> 01:33:41,955
what's he-?

685
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:44,357
MERRIDEw:
well, he's...

686
01:35:18,729 --> 01:35:23,223
oh, uh, Jed,
I got a little something for you.

687
01:35:25,469 --> 01:35:28,336
I arrest you in the name
of the United Stated government.

688
01:35:28,506 --> 01:35:32,203
- why, you dirty, double-crossing-
- oh, shut up.

689
01:35:32,376 --> 01:35:34,844
would you rather rot in a Mexican jaiI?

690
01:35:54,098 --> 01:35:58,296
You understand I need not let you
have these prisoners?

691
01:35:58,469 --> 01:36:01,165
oh, yes, sir. Yeah, I understand.

692
01:36:01,338 --> 01:36:05,035
But I arrested them before your men arrived.
I was already bringing them in.

693
01:36:05,209 --> 01:36:08,303
- Yes, but-
- The gold they stole was American gold.

694
01:36:08,479 --> 01:36:10,310
So you insist on reminding me.

695
01:36:10,848 --> 01:36:12,145
But, still, it is recovered.

696
01:36:12,316 --> 01:36:15,911
what happens to it afterwards
is for our governments to decide.

697
01:36:16,086 --> 01:36:18,350
Remember, you are always welcome
in my house.

698
01:36:18,522 --> 01:36:20,012
- Thank you, generaI.
- Adios.

699
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:21,715
Adios.

700
01:36:27,398 --> 01:36:28,422
Adios, Ben.

701
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:33,702
Diego, would you tell christina-?

702
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:38,440
Tell her goodbye.

703
01:36:38,843 --> 01:36:39,901
I will.

704
01:36:42,046 --> 01:36:44,071
cowAN: Howdy, marshaI.
- Howdy, Ben.

705
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:47,878
Adios, catlow.

706
01:36:48,819 --> 01:36:50,411
Keep the fire burning, pussycat.

707
01:36:50,588 --> 01:36:52,522
I'II light it only for you.

708
01:36:53,224 --> 01:36:54,657
well, she damn near killed us.

709
01:36:54,825 --> 01:36:57,521
when I get back, she'll wish she had.

710
01:36:59,263 --> 01:37:01,424
Adios, Rosita.

711
01:37:06,003 --> 01:37:07,868
come on, get in, get in, get in.

712
01:37:11,609 --> 01:37:12,940
oh.

713
01:37:14,178 --> 01:37:15,839
Howdy.

714
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:23,576
well, where are you going?

715
01:37:24,788 --> 01:37:27,621
I decided to take a holiday in Tucson.

716
01:37:31,395 --> 01:37:34,057
Do you mind if I traveI with you-?

717
01:37:45,576 --> 01:37:46,770
MAN:
Drop your guns.

718
01:37:47,378 --> 01:37:48,777
Drop them.

719
01:37:58,188 --> 01:38:00,053
what's the matter, Miller?

720
01:38:01,025 --> 01:38:02,856
can't you decide who to kill first?

721
01:38:05,329 --> 01:38:07,160
Look, you got no quarreI with the lady.

722
01:38:07,331 --> 01:38:08,764
why don't we just move away.

723
01:38:15,339 --> 01:38:17,307
[IN RASPY VolcE]
Before...

724
01:38:17,474 --> 01:38:23,208
...I kill you both...

725
01:38:24,148 --> 01:38:26,981
...know why.

726
01:39:00,718 --> 01:39:02,310
Ben, are you all right?

727
01:39:02,886 --> 01:39:04,444
Ben.

728
01:39:04,622 --> 01:39:06,249
They sure messed up a good shirt.

729
01:39:06,690 --> 01:39:08,521
You're all right.

730
01:39:14,565 --> 01:39:15,930
oh.

731
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:17,328
I wouldn't use that, ma'am.

732
01:39:18,068 --> 01:39:19,262
I'll make a deaI with you.

733
01:39:19,436 --> 01:39:22,837
You keep Ben here and fix him up,
I'll appoint myself deputy...

734
01:39:23,007 --> 01:39:27,034
...and take these dangerous criminals
right across the border.

735
01:39:29,046 --> 01:39:30,513
This will make it officiaI.

736
01:39:30,681 --> 01:39:32,774
Get back in that stage.

737
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:34,713
You heard me.

738
01:39:34,885 --> 01:39:37,012
Get inside.

739
01:39:37,187 --> 01:39:39,348
Stay put.

740
01:39:40,624 --> 01:39:42,888
oh, I see.

741
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:46,655
I'm gonna have terrible trouble keeping
those bandidos from escaping, ma'am.

742
01:39:46,830 --> 01:39:49,424
cowAN: Jed?
- Yes, Ben.

743
01:39:50,501 --> 01:39:53,061
- Jed.
- Yes?

744
01:39:54,204 --> 01:39:56,729
You really are so full of-

745
01:39:56,907 --> 01:39:58,932
Shh. Not in front of the lady.

746
01:39:59,376 --> 01:40:02,470
Besides, where is your respect
for the law?
