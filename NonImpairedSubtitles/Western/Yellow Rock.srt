1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,519
Since the time of my elders,

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,439
when the white man first came upon us,

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,999
we have struggled to survive,

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,439
and live our peaceful ways.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,279
But their shadow cast its curse 
upon our people

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,119
and darkened all our days.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,439
They took our small ones,
and sold them as slaves.

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,679
They took our scalps and
sold them for profit.

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,639
Our heads were severed for more.

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,359
Our hearts were full of sorrow.

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,439
We prayed to the Great Spirit in the sky:

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,519
Do not abandon us.

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,599
Our only reply....

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,839
the sound thundering hooves upon 
the chest of our Mother Earth.

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,279
The sound that was once the Great Buffalo

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,319
is now of only those who 
come to take our lands.

17
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,159
Welcome to Yellow Rock

18
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,799
Gentlemen.

19
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,879
Whisky for all of us.

20
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,359
Leave the bottle.

21
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,039
Thank you, sir.

22
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,879
You remember me?

23
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,359
Yeah, I remember you.

24
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,959
I'm looking for Tom Hanner.
You know where he is?

25
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,119
He's probably drunk somewhere.
He don't come around here no more.

26
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,039
Where is he?

27
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,799
I really don't know.

28
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,759
That's more like it.

29
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,759
Try the church.

30
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,079
- Give me a bottle of whiskey.
- Yes, sir.

31
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,879
That'll be 25 cents.

32
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,279
Dietrich.

33
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,639
Thank you.

34
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,999
I need to talk to you, Tom.

35
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,239
I heard you lost your boy.

36
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,079
I'm sorry to hear that.

37
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,399
My brother and his son went trapping.

38
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,279
They never came back.

39
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,239
Around Falcon's Peak.

40
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,839
That's near the Black Paw territory.

41
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,159
I need you to take me 
and my men out there.

42
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,639
It's the only kin I have, Tom.

43
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,519
And you're the only man
I know who could find them.

44
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,999
They don't take kindly on white men.

45
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,039
I know that.
That's why I need you.

46
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,719
There is $ 20 gold.

47
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,479
And more once we get up there.

48
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,439
Did you found him?

49
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,079
Yeah.

50
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,319
Dietrich!

51
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,959
Look at me, son-of-a-bitch!

52
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,919
I am McKInley's son.

53
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,559
You remember him?

54
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,039
Get up.

55
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,759
Get up!

56
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,719
Tell us or die.

57
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,599
Go get him.

58
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,639
Hanner?

59
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,799
You're in there?

60
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,759
He ain't in there, boss.

61
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,079
Where is he at?

62
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,359
I tried to relieve it.

63
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,039
Take his pulse.

64
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,559
I have to open up 
his leg and make a suture.

65
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,799
Explain it.

66
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,399
Tell her to keep calm.

67
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,439
You have to hold him back.

68
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,479
Hold him down tight.

69
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,679
I have his leg.

70
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,559
Come on!

71
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,799
I'll kill you, son-of-a-bitch!

72
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,639
What the hell are you shooting at?

73
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,999
Hold it. 
There are more of them.

74
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,759
Come on! Come on!

75
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,919
I'm just stepping on ahead.

76
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,599
How about that one, Farley?

77
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,359
Yeah, siree! I got it good.

78
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,319
That ain't even good meat.

79
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,199
Out of the way.

80
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,199
Jack ass.

81
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,359
Indians believe that killing 
a raven is a bad omen.

82
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,479
Doctor, what should we tell her?

83
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,839
Goddamn it, Farley! 
What the hell are you up for?

84
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,199
Have you seen a ghost?

85
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,399
Goddamn, you're a damn jack ass.

86
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,399
Hey, Mr. Dietrich.

87
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,679
You want a little whiskey?

88
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,159
Put that away.

89
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,399
You want some?

90
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,959
- You've seen him, huh?
- I hardly know the man.

91
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,359
They say the ancient ones
work through your hands.

92
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,319
When moon rises,
they're gonna sing for Little Bear,

93
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,959
with the spirit of the gods.

94
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,319
And they want 
you as an honored guest.

95
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,679
I'm the one who's honored.

96
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,799
They give many thanks to you.

97
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,479
Many blessing.

98
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,599
I'll be back before moonrise.

99
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,159
There's a cabin, a few miles out.

100
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,919
At the end of Canyon Creek.
We will stop there.

101
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,319
Why?

102
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,759
This is Black Paw territory.
They know we're here.

103
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,199
Without their permission to pass,
this is as far as we're going.

104
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,959
There's a doctor at that cabin,
she takes care of them.

105
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,279
She'll do the talking for us.

106
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,199
- Can't you do it?
- I'm afraid not, this is the only way.

107
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,999
That's the medicine you need 
to give to your daughter.

108
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,919
You need to give the medicine.

109
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,199
Sarah!

110
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,279
He doesn't understand what I'm saying.

111
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,319
Put ??two spoons.

112
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,039
Wait here, I'll let you know.

113
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,359
Anybody home?

114
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,319
I'm just here to see the doctor.

115
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,719
You're talking to.

116
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,119
Tom Hanner.

117
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,999
You look like hell.

118
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,319
Yeah, it has been a tough year.

119
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,279
That's why I am here to talk about.
I need your help.

120
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,479
How long have they been missing?

121
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,559
About a week now.

122
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,679
It'll take a while to search,
a few days at least

123
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,839
There's no telling what injuries 
we're dealing with.

124
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,519
All I know is that they 
didn't come back

125
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,759
and that sure ain't good
for my brother and his boy.

126
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,439
Then there is no time to waste.

127
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,399
Tom, if you gonna lead through 
the territory,

128
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,199
you're gonna need full consent 
from all the elders.

129
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,879
The doctor better come back 
with the right answer.

130
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,319
Mister, she'll come back with
the only answer that there is.

131
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,959
Hanner.

132
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,359
He doesn't understand our language well.

133
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,959
I tell him why you are here.

134
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,799
We do not know where they are at.

135
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,399
They were trapping near Falcon's Peak.

136
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,799
They could have crossed your
territory by mistake.

137
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,839
I know you have no reason to help us.

138
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,319
But we just mean to find the man and the boy, 
and get of your land as quick as possible.

139
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,959
You seem to speak truth,

140
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,559
but the white man has lied to us before.

141
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,759
Those were dark days for us.

142
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,999
Did you take money from these white men?

143
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,519
Yes.

144
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,679
You take money to save two lives,
there is no honor in this.

145
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,799
You're right.

146
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,639
He says your heart is good,
you speak the truth,

147
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,319
but we must talk alone.

148
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,839
I thought you'd left 
these people by now.

149
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,399
Why? These people needed me, 
that's what mattered.

150
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,879
You're all alone.

151
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,599
No, I was alone back there.

152
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,919
We have permission to 
pass through, tomorrow.

153
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,119
Aces.

154
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,639
Three cowboys.

155
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,799
It's round-up time!

156
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,279
Damn it Roscoe,
that's four hands in a row!

157
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,879
If you weren't so busy drinking, 
you'd better cards to play.

158
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,119
If you don't shut your trap,
I'll shut it for you.

159
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,039
Why do we bring him along with us!

160
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,919
To hell with you, Farley.
You're always cutting on me.

161
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,759
You want to shut my trap, old man?

162
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,359
Then why don't you shut it, shut it!

163
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,719
I'm not gonna warn you again, 
you hear me?

164
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,959
- Do you hear me?
- Yeah.

165
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,999
It smells like shit in here, lady.

166
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,959
That's because you boys need bath.

167
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,999
Don't worry none, 
the horses don't mind.

168
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,399
So what are we gonna do if our 
Indian friends deny our request?

169
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,359
One way or the other, 
we're going up there.

170
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,399
We're giving thanks with 
this sacred necklace.

171
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,559
It's a very powerful gift.

172
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,839
The Great Hunter came down 
from the mountain

173
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,999
and he sees a woman with long red hair.

174
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,959
But he cannot wake her, 
so he takes you two...

175
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,519
to the mouth of the rock
to save you.

176
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,599
Dr. Sarah is a protected one.

177
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,039
Beautiful, isn't it?

178
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,479
Very.

179
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,639
If you can not they'll find,
just make sure you all find your way back.

180
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,479
Thank you, ma'am.

181
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,279
You take good care of the doctor.

182
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,679
She's a strong one all right,
but just in case I'm counting on you.

183
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,839
Don't you worry about that.

184
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,359
I have a good feeling about you.
Don't make me wrong.

185
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,599
Martha.

186
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,039
- Give Totano his aspirin.
- I did, Sarah. I did.

187
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,319
- Do not forget the man with bedsores.
- I know, doc, I know.

188
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,719
I know you hate leaving, 
but we will be fine.

189
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,639
You're the one I'm worried about.

190
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,239
I don't get a good feeling about them.

191
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,639
I mean when you was gone, they 
acted like a bunch of rodnecks.

192
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,439
I got your meaning. 
I'll be careful.

193
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,159
Okay, come on.

194
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,039
Ma'am.

195
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,039
I have to say is awful nice having
a member of the fair sex around of us.

196
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,399
If you stay close,
I'll keep you safe.

197
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,319
I'll do fine by myself.

198
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,279
Oh, I'm sure you'll do.

199
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,559
Stop!

200
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,919
- We can't go in there.
- Why not?

201
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,039
We're close to their sacred burial ground.
If we go in we'll bring the curse.

202
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,999
We have to find another way.

203
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,839
It will cost us another day 
or two at least.

204
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,399
To hell with that, we're going in.
Let's go!

205
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,919
- I don't like this.
- I don't like it either.

206
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,039
It's thin air, huh Roscoe...

207
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,359
Shut up, Billy.

208
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,199
A bunch of dead Indians, huh.

209
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,799
I want you to understand
something, Mr. Dietrich.

210
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,439
That burial ground was sacred to them.

211
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,159
And we desecrated it,
when we walked through.

212
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,119
And I want you to understand,

213
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,519
I don't give a damn 
about these Indians.

214
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,359
All I care about is finding 
my brother and his boy.

215
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,519
Farley, what the hell was that?

216
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,199
Farley, what is going on?
What is this?

217
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,599
Are it the Indians, huh?

218
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,039
It's wolves.

219
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,599
Don't let them get to the horses!

220
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,759
Billy, you see them?

221
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,159
Stay close.

222
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,559
Roscoe!

223
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,519
Let no one away!

224
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,439
They're all around us, god damn it!

225
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,199
He says they're hunting us.

226
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,959
Roscoe!

227
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,839
Don't you stand there, help me!

228
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,839
Get them off!

229
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,399
Hold it.

230
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,799
Help me!

231
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,039
His arm, I think it's broken.

232
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,919
Get me my bag.

233
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,559
Do you think the Indian is right?
It's the curse?

234
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,639
He's praying to the Great Spirit

235
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,959
for forgiveness for crossing 
the sacred land.

236
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,719
We could use it.

237
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,519
I guess we both know we should 
have listened to him last night.

238
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,159
Yeah, you're right about that.

239
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,119
Whiskey is not a cure
for all answering.

240
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,599
I know.

241
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,479
But it helps.

242
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,559
After my wife passed away

243
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,519
it was just me and my boy.

244
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,759
I took him trapping one day.

245
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,399
He was fooling around...

246
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,999
and went chasing after possums.

247
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,119
He fell into a river bed...

248
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,399
Before I knew it...

249
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,999
the river had him...

250
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,039
by the time I got to him...

251
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,959
He was only 8 years old.

252
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,359
I am sorry, Tom. Truly.

253
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,079
You know I...

254
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,479
I look into the face of death 
every single day.

255
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,919
I'd wish I could defeat it, 
but I can't.

256
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,999
I try.

257
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,639
Because a person's fate is not
always in our hands.

258
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,999
- Maybe it's time to be different.
- Maybe.

259
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,959
- I sure hope they'll find that boy.
- Me too.

260
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,799
It seems we're more concerned about
than they are though.

261
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,839
You noticed that too?

262
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,119
You do know Dietrich, don't you?

263
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,519
A bit.

264
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:24,639
But I stay mostly to myself
these days.

265
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,799
Last night they didn't recognize 
the sound of wolves.

266
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,399
But they told they were trappers.

267
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,639
- Dietrich told you that?
- That's right.

268
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,519
- That's horseshit.

269
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,599
Good morning.

270
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,359
I need to talk to Broken Wing.

271
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,759
She has a soft spot for that Indian.

272
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,599
I don't trust him.

273
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,919
- I'm just saying.
- Just saying what?

274
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,439
I'll tell you what Hanner, you mind 
your business and I mind mine.

275
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,679
- Hey, what's he doing?
- It's gonna help you, all right.

276
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,959
- What did he say?
- He said: Now you are "broken wing" too.

277
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,519
God damn Indian! Get, get!
Get him out of here!

278
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,799
Relax.

279
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,039
- I don't want his voodoo around me.
- It's all right.

280
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,719
It's gonna hurt an itch a little, 
so leave it alone.

281
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,239
Here.

282
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,399
That don't get you luck.
That's poison oak.

283
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:30,119
Billy just found a place to water
the horses, back up there ways.

284
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,999
Okay, let's see it.

285
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,479
Hold it right there!

286
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,359
Boss!

287
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,319
Get down of that horse.

288
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,159
I said get down of that horse!

289
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,759
Cobb!

290
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,279
How close are we to Falcon's Peak?

291
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,199
This is Falcon's Peak.

292
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:14,039
You want to find your kin? You go find them.
I ain't helping you. This is horseshit.

293
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,319
What's happening?

294
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,119
Let's go!

295
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,679
McKinley / Johnson
Mining Company

296
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,999
Cobb, get him! Get him!

297
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,319
Don't you move, son-of-a-bitch!

298
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,719
- What the hell is going on?
- What does it look like?

299
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,879
Looks like you're a goddamn liar.

300
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,919
- Tie him up and drag him.
- No.

301
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,959
Don't you touch him!
Don't you touch him!

302
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,039
Damn, god damn you!

303
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,439
You ain't dead yet?

304
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,119
Hey son-of-a-bitch, 
I'm talking to you.

305
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,559
Hey drunkard, you want a drink?

306
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,999
- Look at this.
- Come on, move it down.

307
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,799
Warning!

308
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,799
McKinley / Johnson
Mining Company

309
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,999
Give me a hand.

310
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,599
I got it.

311
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,959
I got it, I got it.

312
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:22,679
Wait up. Watch it!

313
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,879
There, Roscoe.

314
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,439
Hurry up, Roscoe.

315
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,399
Son-of-a-bitch.

316
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,639
- That old man was right.
- Damn!

317
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,119
How much you figure we got here?

318
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,999
More than enough!

319
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,959
Look at this.

320
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:25,359
- I can not believe!
- Have you seen?

321
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,279
This is gold!

322
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,239
Pure gold.

323
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,439
Go.

324
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,199
Let's start get this on the horses.

325
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,119
I ain't leaving.

326
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,319
Come on, move it!

327
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,079
Move it!

328
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,479
Boss!

329
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,319
Boss! That Indian is gone!

330
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,359
Boss, that Indian is gone!

331
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,199
Boss!

332
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,399
That Indian is gone.

333
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:10,279
Damn it! Go find him before 
he brings more back here.

334
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:13,639
We ain't going nowhere until
we work out a split.

335
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,799
There is plenty of gold.

336
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,439
Yeah Farley, with Billy's take,
there is more for all of us.

337
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,839
He has been buried just 15 minutes. 
And you already are taking his cut?

338
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,239
He's dead. He can't use it.

339
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,079
You're wasting time!
Go find that Indian!

340
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,039
What the hell are you doing?

341
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,999
That Indian is gonna have
running us around in circles.

342
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,439
Get him up.

343
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,999
I need him to get me back here.

344
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,159
They never gonna find him.

345
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,439
And he's gonna come back and kill you.

346
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,999
I don't trust Max.

347
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:40,479
If he tries anything, 
it'll be the last thing he does.

348
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,999
Relax Farley, we'll get back to camp.

349
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,919
If he's still to camp,
we'll take Max.

350
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,959
We've gone far enough.

351
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,599
I'm going back for the gold.

352
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,959
Come on, Mr. Hanner.

353
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,439
Me and you here.

354
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,839
Get up!

355
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,679
What?

356
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,279
You want a gun, Hanner?

357
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,159
Get the hell up, Hanner!

358
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,919
You want this?

359
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,959
Here you go.

360
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,039
You want it?

361
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:27,639
What do you want?

362
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,119
I want your blood.

363
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,199
- Where the hell have you been?
- We couldn't find our way back.

364
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:20,479
Where is Hanner?

365
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,039
He's dead.

366
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,919
Where is the gold?

367
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,959
I got as many bags
I can out of there.

368
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,479
Tomorrow morning you can get your 
fat ass in there and get the rest.

369
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:49,679
I can't figure out why they didn't 
come back for that gold.

370
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,359
They never left.

371
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,679
They died here.

372
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,399
They caught the white man's disease.

373
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,039
Shut up.

374
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:12,199
The only one I can't cure, 
the only one the Indians are immune to.

375
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:19,199
The Indians were right.
You got the fever for yellow rock.

376
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,759
- There ain't no such thing.
- Yes, there is!

377
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,879
- There ain't!
- Yes, there is!

378
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,039
There ain't no such thing!

379
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:27,079
- I told you to shut up.
- You shut up!

380
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,439
Let me tell you something.

381
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,919
The Indians say, 
when the white man came,

382
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,879
they opened a wound
in that mountain.

383
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,039
They cut its veins.

384
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,039
And he mountain bled.

385
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:44,679
And the caught the fever.
They were riddled with it.

386
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,119
I see the symptoms.

387
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:50,799
In all of you.

388
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,839
It makes you sweat,

389
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,639
it makes you a headache.

390
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,199
You can't think of anything 
else but the gold.

391
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,599
You feel it?

392
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,439
I see it in all of you.

393
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,519
You're just trying to take 
that gold out of the mountain.

394
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,759
And you won't make it down alive.

395
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,799
You hear me?

396
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,959
You got it the worst.

397
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,959
There is no curing you.

398
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,119
No curing you!

399
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:23,399
Keep your goddamn mouth shut!

400
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,079
You're all gonna die here.

401
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,199
You hear me?

402
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:01,839
Hey, boss.

403
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,399
What she said last night 
about that curse...

404
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,399
You think there is
anything to it?

405
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,839
What the hell are you talking about?

406
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:14,919
The gold...
Why ain't nobody come back for it?

407
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:20,839
Because those jackasses probably got killed 
by the Indians and they left it behind.

408
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,119
Go tend to those horses.

409
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,119
Yes, sir.

410
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,959
You're gonna do what you said?

411
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,759
Just load the gold on, 
and I'll kill them all.

412
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,479
Get your ass up here.

413
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:41,559
Shit!

414
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,879
I need some water.

415
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,519
Can I have some water, please?

416
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,239
Please.

417
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,039
You're limping.

418
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,759
A goddamn horse stepped on my foot.

419
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,839
If you untie me I can help you.
I'll take a look at it.

420
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,919
I can't do that, ma'am.

421
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:49,639
You need to untie me.
Let me go, I didn't do anything.

422
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:54,239
I don't deserve to die.
Roscoe, let me go.

423
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,719
You are not like the other ones.
Let me go.

424
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,239
Get up here.

425
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,439
I'm sorry, boss.

426
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:24,839
I got a horse get away from me.

427
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,879
Never mind the goddamn horse.
Get the rest of those bags.

428
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,039
Yes, sir.

429
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:34,119
I can't load all the stuff
on the horses.

430
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:38,559
What the hell you are doing?
We're wasting time.

431
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,919
If that Indian made it out there alive,
he'll bring the whole goddamn tribe back here.

432
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,079
What are we gonna do about her?

433
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:52,039
Let's use her horse to bring
down more gold.

434
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:01,519
Roscoe, untie her.

435
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,639
You bitch!

436
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,199
Load the horses.

437
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,399
You've caused enough trouble, bitch.

438
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:35,919
Kill him.

439
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,359
I love to.

440
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,399
Shit!

441
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:15,679
Sarah!

442
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:42,439
Name of God! I got it!

443
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,519
I'll get it! I'll get it!

444
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,799
Goddamn, shit... I'll get it!

445
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,879
I got it!

446
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:57,039
I got mine! I got mine!

447
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:22,999
With the gold, I'll pay me
girls, whiskey...

448
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:36,959
I got gold.

449
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:42,039
I got gold...

450
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:44,959
I got gold.

451
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,799
The yellow rock...

452
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:53,559
Not yours.

453
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,119
On that day in 1880

454
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:04,039
our tribe was once again saved
from the greed of the white man.

455
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,399
But that day would not last.

456
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:10,759
For their fever for our
Yellow Rock would not turn.

457
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:15,079
As my great-grandfather,
Angry Wolf said:

458
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:17,479
"They will come as drops in water."

459
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:21,399
"And rain down upon us."

460
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,319
And this they do.

461
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:27,839
I'm called Black Feather, the Raven,

462
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:32,159
Omen of death to our people.

463
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:37,079
I am the last of my tribe.

464
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:41,439
For we are no longer...
