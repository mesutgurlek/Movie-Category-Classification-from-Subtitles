1
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,598
Little heavier in the shoulders?

2
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,276
That's from slinging that
ten pounds sledge.

3
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,270
They all get it.

4
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,035
It's all there.

5
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,229
Do you mind if I look?

6
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,270
It's just that.

7
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,596
I don't know.

8
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,756
I keep my eye on all
that stuff myself.

9
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,831
Deveraux!

10
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,517
Let's go.

11
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,796
Where?

12
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,519
The Governor wants to see you.

13
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,359
I don't want to see him.

14
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,317
I'm thorough here.
- Let's go, partner.

15
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,435
Here's your grub.

16
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,230
Sidewinder.

17
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,516
Thanks.

18
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,990
Good gun.

19
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,515
Nice balance.

20
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,876
Come on over.

21
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,756
Joe Deveraux.

22
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,958
Yes, it'll be just a minute.

23
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,479
The Governor'll see you now.

24
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,310
Good luck, Joe.

25
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,956
Thanks a lot.

26
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,709
Glad you came, Joseph.

27
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,119
I couldn't do anything else.

28
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,469
I wanted to talk to you.

29
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,832
The simplest way was
to bring you here.

30
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,231
Sit down.

31
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,708
You look different, Joseph.

32
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,878
More mature, I guess, and...

33
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,116
...changed.

34
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,709
Three years brings changes.
- You're not interested...

35
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,279
...in what prison did to me.

36
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,475
Yes I am.

37
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,995
I'm very interested.

38
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,239
Barbara still hasn't married.

39
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,919
Anything else?
- Yes, there is.

40
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,713
There's considerably more.

41
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,991
Sit down.

42
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,520
I brought you here to keep
you from being killed.

43
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,312
You can think I'm hypocritical.

44
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,470
But for the respect
I had for your father...

45
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,749
...and your mother...

46
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,315
My mother?

47
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,590
Never mind.

48
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,991
There's been enough violence in
the ranch. I won't have any more.

49
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,674
I won't have any more.

50
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,512
Your brothers are in the next room.

51
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,553
They've a proposition to make you.

52
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,915
A business proposition.

53
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,039
They assure me it's a good one.

54
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,636
I'd like...

55
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,913
I'd advise you to take it.

56
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,630
Come in.

57
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,996
Hello, Joe.

58
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,036
Joe.
- Joe.

59
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,793
I told him and I tell you, Ben.
I'll stand for no trouble.

60
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,552
There won't be any trouble.

61
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,154
We don't want any and...

62
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,028
...l'm sure Joe doesn't.

63
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,032
I'll give you ten minutes.
- Fine.

64
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,548
You look good, Joe.

65
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,390
I'm glad to see it wasn't
too tough on you.

66
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,874
I know it wasn't easy but...

67
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,031
The Governor said you'd a
proposition for me.

68
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,389
He told me to take it.

69
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,313
What? Before you'd even heard it?

70
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,991
Why he should know better than that.

71
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,711
Besides, this is a family
matter, Joe.

72
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,638
We're still your brothers.
- Just tell me the proposition.

73
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,436
All right.

74
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,749
You see, Joe...

75
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,628
...there have been
a lot of changes...

76
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,835
...since you went in.

77
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,233
I can see some of them right here.

78
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,551
What kind of...
- I'll do the talking, Denny.

79
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,436
Sure, Ben.

80
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,879
That's one of the changes.

81
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,913
The other is that we run
the ranch from town now.

82
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,031
It's gotten too big to
operate from home.

83
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,599
What did you do with my mother?

84
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,398
You know, Joe, she doesn't like town.

85
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,073
She went back to her own people,
Joe. That's all she wanted.

86
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,833
Anything else we'd have done it,
just as we will for you, but...

87
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,799
...I think you ought to realize...

88
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,155
...that we've got different
responsibilities now.

89
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,913
Deveraux Ranch isn't just cattle
any more. We've got...

90
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,076
...oil leases, mineral rights...

91
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,032
...and stockholders
we have to protect.

92
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,355
Just tell me the deal.

93
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,913
All right, I'll tell you the deal.

94
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,950
It's Oregon. Brand new territory.

95
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,070
We'll buy you a spread, stock it and
cover your losses for three years.

96
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,070
Or else?

97
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,718
There is no 'or else'.

98
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,036
That's it.

99
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,155
I think that'll get you started.

100
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,554
What if I don't like Oregon?

101
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,793
You'll like it.
- I hear it's real nice country.

102
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,555
We worked it out for you
the best we could, but...

103
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,759
...if there's something else...

104
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,108
There is something else.

105
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,156
Three years.

106
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,468
Three years out of my life.

107
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,871
Three years I spent in
that stinking jail.

108
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,714
Can you give me back those?

109
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,548
No. Not even if I had
them to give you.

110
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,755
I lost mine sweating out chores
for Pa before you ever born.

111
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,876
I'm not crying about them.
I'm just telling you.

112
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,315
You've got our offer and
you've got our money.

113
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,631
The train goes through here at six.
Be on it and the deal stands.

114
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,513
That's not very smart, Joe.

115
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,720
But the rest of the deal stands
if you make that train.

116
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,509
He's real hot, ain't he?

117
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,709
He'll cool down.

118
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,554
When he does, he'll take
the deal. He's too smart.

119
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,798
Ain't that right, Ben?
- I don't know.

120
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,394
Anybody that throws 10,000 dollars
in a spittoon makes me nervous.

121
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,396
Pick it up.

122
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,152
For the price, he'll get
you three and back.

123
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,793
You sure you want that saddle?

124
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,469
Another couple of dollars and
I give you a better one.

125
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,390
What's your hurry?

126
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,511
Ben said find out where he was going.

127
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,229
I know where he's going.

128
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,399
Get on your horse, fellow!

129
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,993
Joseph! It is you.

130
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,316
Hello, Two Moons.

131
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,031
The gods, they smile on us this day.

132
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,549
I guess they do.

133
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,598
You missed me about three inches.

134
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,515
Maybe you're getting old.

135
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,113
If I want to hit you, I hit you.

136
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,793
You come home to stay, Joseph?

137
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,157
I don't know.

138
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,515
Your mother is at the meeting
place of our people.

139
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,591
Is she all right?
- She is the same.

140
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,554
She waits for you.

141
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,235
Yeah.

142
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,911
There's something else
I got to settle first.

143
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,149
You are alone. I have 20 men...
- And have your tribe destroyed?

144
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,077
No.

145
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,036
Where you go?

146
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,428
To the home place.
- Good.

147
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,750
Talk to Running Wolf.
- I'm not talk to anybody.

148
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,875
The Old Man's dead.

149
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,952
Do you listen to that
medicine man too?

150
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,913
At night, I hear wolf calls.
- You always hear wolves.

151
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,196
Pa never let anybody kill
them, you know that.

152
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,354
You want to ride in with me?

153
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,150
Well?

154
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,232
It is fitting you go alone, Joseph.

155
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,953
Superstitious old fool.

156
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,070
Hello, Pa.

157
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,030
I came back.

158
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,915
The old men said you wouldn't
rest easy till I did.

159
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,829
I've heard the medicine men...

160
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,195
...think you're running
the hills with the wolves.

161
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,035
Maybe you are at that.

162
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,395
What should I do, Pa?

163
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,074
Have you a sign for me?
Or are you to let me figure...?

164
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,716
Hold him still.

165
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,551
Just brand him, don't barbecue him.

166
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,549
'¿Cómo está, señor?
- Muy bien, Francisco'.

167
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,270
'Señor' Matt...

168
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,879
...all goes well?
- Yes.

169
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,475
We'll have the other camps
cleaned up by sundown.

170
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,356
Here too.

171
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,988
We'll drive the beef herd
toward home tomorrow.

172
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,714
Take them slow.

173
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,156
They're running off stock
on the east range.

174
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,232
Johnny was riding herd last night.
They shot his horse under him.

175
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,630
He walked and told Two Moons.
- Ben!

176
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,870
Get a horse!

177
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,000
You want I get some boys?
- No, we'll handle it.

178
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,475
Not a sign of them.

179
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,037
They rode in the stream.
You can't tell where they went.

180
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,196
Horse slipped, no?
- Which way, do you think?

181
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:07,951
Let's go.

182
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,188
Two, three...

183
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,193
...four, five, I count, Pa.

184
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,556
Six!

185
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,830
It's Pa!

186
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,876
Get out of here!

187
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,150
Let's go!

188
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,836
Get out of there!

189
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,073
Get up, you're not hurt.

190
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,074
Let this steer loose.

191
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,080
Could you change the brand
without botching it?

192
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,319
I've seen these two before.

193
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,311
We fired them last year.
They're no good.

194
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,991
Well?

195
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,633
We didn't mean nothing, Pa.

196
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,635
Just a couple little old steers.
- Why?

197
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,955
I don't know.

198
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,993
We needed the money, that's why.

199
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,673
Money? But you got money.

200
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,191
If you mean that lousy
40 a month...

201
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,390
Don't ever use that tone to me.
- Pa, we didn't mean nothing.

202
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,832
No, you didn't. You figured you've
steal some cattle and sell them.

203
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,515
Anybody would know that brand,
even though it had been raised.

204
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,713
But you figured nobody...
- Pa, we didn't even think of that.

205
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,909
I don't think you did.

206
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,150
You two together couldn't
have figure that out.

207
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,470
But somebody did?
Who put you up to it?

208
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,150
Nobody.

209
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,151
It doesn't make any difference.
You did it.

210
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,512
Be sure it wouldn't be a secret...

211
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,148
...you had to drag these
two lunkheads in with you.

212
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,196
They no talk.

213
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,237
Let them be. They're not to blame.

214
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,435
Just these two.

215
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,315
What should I do with'em?

216
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,153
They were caught rustling cattle
and changing the brands.

217
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,880
If you notify the Sheriff
the whole state'll know it.

218
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,389
We could hang them or shoot them...
- Cut it, Pa.

219
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,395
He thinks I'm fooling.

220
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,475
Lots of fellows felt that way
until we taught them...

221
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,949
...that you don't steal cattle
from Deveraux Ranch.

222
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,992
But the cattle are as much
yours as they are mine.

223
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,676
And they would have
been yours too, but...

224
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,715
What do you think, Ben?

225
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,799
You don't pay them enough.

226
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,520
Or you either, Ben?
They get the same as you.

227
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,311
If you ask me, I'll tell you, you
get twice what you're worth.

228
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,832
There ain't a man living who can
say that he stole cattle from me...

229
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,672
...but you two mushheads thought...

230
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,312
You wanted them so bad,
take them and get out.

231
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,478
The money you get for them'll keep
you until you can steal more.

232
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,229
But remember this: . .

233
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,833
...don't steal them from here.

234
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,555
We can't let him do this.

235
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,596
Why not?

236
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,390
I warned them they were
only asking for trouble.

237
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,909
Pa, you don't mean this.
They're your own sons.

238
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,154
They're a couple of cheap
tinhorn cattle thieves.

239
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,154
Two men are dead because of them.
- You just can't do it.

240
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,356
I did. Let go, son.

241
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,431
You should have had
all this yesterday.

242
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,315
If I'd been half smart I never
would've let you see it.

243
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,390
I don't know why it is but
every wife thinks...

244
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,394
What are you trying to do, kill me?
- Finish the telling.

245
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,391
Nothing to tell. I just
sent them packing.

246
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,190
Money they said they wanted.
I pay'em, don't I?

247
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,154
They have all they needs on
the ranch, haven't they?

248
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,876
Haven't they?

249
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,516
Perhaps.

250
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,872
But I don't think it
is money they need.

251
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,678
They were stealing cattle to get it.

252
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,389
What is it they do need?

253
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,948
They are not my sons.

254
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,834
It is difficult to say.

255
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,878
I think it is you, my husband.

256
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,995
You have never given them
anything of yourself.

257
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,994
That's a lot of! That kind of talk!

258
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,040
I got a big ranch to run.
The biggest of the country.

259
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,556
Besides, I've built it all
up for'em, haven't I?

260
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,995
Al right, I built it for myself.
But it's theirs when I die.

261
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,999
Suppose I haven't given'em time.

262
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,674
Does that mean they've to grow
up to be cattle thieves?

263
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,790
You are the father.

264
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,559
They want to be part of you.

265
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,311
If you do not give yourself,
they take.

266
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,795
Even if it means stealing
something that is yours.

267
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,350
That's Indian talk, squaw talk.
I don't understand you.

268
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,228
You understand.

269
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,553
That's what makes you angry.

270
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,037
That and because you've sent'em away.

271
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,589
They are your sons.

272
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,911
They're not yours. If Joe had
done a thing like that...

273
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,595
Because they're not, I have tried
to love them as much as my own.

274
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,435
And you have too.

275
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,790
That must take a power. I know
nothing about. But as I say, Joe...

276
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,359
Joe wouldn't do that.

277
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,439
He's my son, yet I don't
know what he would do.

278
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,597
He is yours, and you do not.

279
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,389
Bring them back.
- No!

280
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,993
I sent'em away and that's that.

281
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,795
Let me.

282
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,590
Sore at me?

283
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,670
No.

284
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,231
It's only because
I don't understand.

285
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,473
You didn't get a very good bargain,
my little Princess.

286
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,234
I have never regretted it.

287
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,799
No all these years you haven't?

288
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,113
How have you stayed so beautiful?

289
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,716
Am I?

290
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,590
Still?

291
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,637
You know, the first day I saw you...

292
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,594
...riding that little paint pony...

293
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,118
...with the antelope skin
shirt and the beads...

294
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,912
...and the feather in your hair...

295
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,074
...I though there was nothing
in the world so beautiful.

296
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,039
I didn't know the half.

297
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,316
We have guests for dinner.
- Send them home.

298
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,799
But they're already here.

299
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,793
You go downstairs and pacify them.
- Without you?

300
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,151
What's the matter? Are you afraid?
- No.

301
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,470
They'll bow and smile
and be very polite.

302
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,550
They'd better.

303
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,869
They know that too.

304
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,995
Are you afraid of them?

305
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,230
I'm afraid of no one,
but you my husband.

306
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,790
Princess.

307
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,873
That sounds like it has
a little of the old Irish.

308
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,476
Are you sure you haven't any
Irishman before I came along?

309
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,995
There is no other Irishman
like you, my husband.

310
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,596
Princess.

311
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,715
Did you?
- No!

312
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,150
I...

313
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,270
Please don't.

314
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,796
Matt!

315
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,953
'Señora' Deveraux.

316
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,359
We've been waiting for you.
- Horace, my apologies. Sorry.

317
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,153
Clem, nice to see you.

318
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,033
Where's Grace? Couldn't she come?

319
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,316
It's her back again.
Hasn't been out in a week.

320
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,278
Must be two weeks
since I've seen her.

321
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,797
I haven't met this young lady.
I should never forget it if I had.

322
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,911
Of course you have, uncle Matt.

323
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,508
It's not Barbara!

324
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,190
Why it can't Barbara, when you
went east you were this high.

325
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,874
I was a little taller than that.
Good evening, 'Señora'.

326
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,995
Not very much.

327
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,757
My, if the years had just done
for me what they've done...

328
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,111
You've met my sons.
- Yes, all four of them.

329
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,789
I expected you two would still
be out with the cattle.

330
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,989
I thought they ought to be
here, so I brought them in.

331
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:13,911
I see.

332
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,312
Are they entertaining you properly?

333
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,233
They've been most gallant.
- A fine set of boys, Matt.

334
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,752
Yes, Madame Deveraux taught
them their manners.

335
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,196
If they smack of the range
still, that's my fault.

336
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,874
I think they resemble you
amazingly, Uncle Matt.

337
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,470
So handsome and charming.
- Your manners weren't neglected.

338
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,710
Shall we go in to dinner?
- May I?

339
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,951
Joe.

340
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,709
What about them?

341
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,992
It was tough, but I got'em drunk...
- I'm not talking about that.

342
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,993
You heard what I said'em...
- You were mad, Pa.

343
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,752
I figured once you...
- You figured!

344
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,837
You've more courage that brains.

345
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,718
One of these days...
- Not tonight, Pa.

346
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,154
You got your good shirt on.

347
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,715
Besides, I think I could
lick you anyway.

348
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,039
That'll be the day, son.

349
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,310
Get in there.

350
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,229
Dear, that old heifer
never did come back.

351
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,959
That was in the days before
I had a seat in my pants.

352
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,355
But they were pretty good
days at that, eh Horace?

353
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,512
What are you eating, Uncle Matt?
- These?

354
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,433
They're pickled cactus grapes.

355
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,154
Cactus grapes?
- Yeah.

356
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,993
I don't think I've seen'em.
- They don't have'em in the east.

357
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,158
They're wonderful appetizers, eh Ben?

358
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,149
Yes, If you like them.

359
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,594
They're real good, Barbara.

360
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,710
Try it.

361
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,671
Don't!

362
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,874
It's a Mexican pepper.
It'll burn the roof of your mouth.

363
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,155
One of Pa's funny jokes.

364
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,278
The Mexicans grind them for cayenne.

365
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,954
Is that right, Uncle Matt?

366
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,036
Yes.

367
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,794
They're not that hot though.

368
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,036
Joe has a tendency to
be tender hearted.

369
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,029
But you eat them.

370
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,832
I eat anything that doesn't eat me.

371
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,115
Not bad at all.

372
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,874
Holly smoke!

373
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,476
Not hot?

374
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,630
A little!

375
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,876
A little!

376
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,270
She would deny it if it tore her
mouth off. Quite girl, Horace.

377
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,673
Why I didn't see before her, if
she's been here for a month?

378
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,517
If you came in town often
you might have.

379
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,036
I had to bring her out here.
- He doesn't come to town.

380
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,670
You've to run a ranch from the back
of the horse, not from a chair.

381
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,116
You find out about
mineral rights, though...

382
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,508
...and beef prices.

383
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,479
I get as good a price as
the next man, isn't right, Ben?

384
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,076
No.

385
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,954
I can show you the figures.

386
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,951
The boys are given me a bad time
tonight. Where did you get tem?

387
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,310
I asked them.

388
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,190
Most of them are averaging a 100%
and a half a pound better'n we are.

389
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,475
What should we do?

390
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,676
Open an office in town,
like the rest of them.

391
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,236
Watch Chicago prices and...
- And who would run the office?

392
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,079
What about Ben? He could do it.

393
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,991
I don't know, he hadn't
mentioned it to me.

394
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,991
Now...
- Wait a minute!

395
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,431
Let Ben talk for himself.
Go ahead, Ben.

396
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,669
Mr. Deveraux...

397
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,358
...our friends need more wine.

398
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,508
My apologies, Madam.

399
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,789
And you, Barbara.

400
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,670
'Vino'.

401
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,628
Sometimes the task of
managing four sons, is...

402
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,075
They look like they're able
to take care themselves.

403
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,548
They've been raised to.

404
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,632
Why wouldn't you to let one of
them take over for you in town?

405
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,472
Barbara, I think we should.

406
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,312
Let her alone, she's perfectly right.

407
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,033
Matter of fact, I think that
Ben could take over in town.

408
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,033
That means giving up part of
the control of the ranch to him.

409
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,919
And you don't like that a bit.

410
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,399
And what's more, I won't do it.

411
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,598
I tell myself he's not ready for it.

412
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,399
That's one problem when you
raise a flock of sons.

413
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,632
You must remember when some
man gains your hand in marriage.

414
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,677
Remember to have daughters.
Simpler...

415
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,315
...and much prettier.

416
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,676
I would be better advise in the
choice of who's to be their father.

417
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,311
The pepper was hotter than I thought.

418
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,239
What's that?
- Cold milk.

419
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,356
It's the only thing tha'll
cool that pepper.

420
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,555
They burn like a fire.

421
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,033
I thought my teeth would melt!

422
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,430
Heavens!

423
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,073
Now if the rest of me'd cool off.
- Shall we walk in the patio?

424
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,195
The wind's died down.

425
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,399
You don't have to be afraid.

426
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,036
Now...

427
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,679
...why should I be afraid?

428
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,235
I don't know.

429
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,672
They think that we'd turned
out to be quite a family.

430
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,712
That's way you came
out here, isn't it?

431
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,149
I suppose so.

432
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,192
Well, do we come up
to our reputation.

433
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,714
Your father certainly does.

434
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,070
Does he always act like that?
- Pretty much.

435
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,355
He's a bearcat, ain't he?

436
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,109
He's and old tyrant.

437
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,912
But you're crazy about
him, aren't you?

438
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,156
Why...

439
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,995
...yeah.

440
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,309
Yeah, I guess I am.

441
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,550
You're not afraid of him.
The rest of them are.

442
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,550
I don't know.
- I do.

443
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,190
Ben is, and so are the others. And
so is my father. It's ridiculous.

444
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,316
It was the peppers that
made you jump him.

445
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,630
He's stubborn and spoiled and mean.

446
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,872
You all let him get away with it.
- You like him too, don't you?

447
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,913
They said in town you'd turned
out to be smartest of the lot.

448
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,109
What else did they say?

449
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,711
That you'd inherited all his charm.

450
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,949
But I don't see it.

451
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,236
Look closer.

452
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,355
Was that to maintain
the Deveraux tradition?

453
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,471
No.

454
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,113
Maybe we'd better go back in.

455
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,188
Joe, I want you.

456
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,916
There's something
wrong with the herd.

457
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,038
Mrs. Deveraux'll show you the rooms.
- All right.

458
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,475
Take off that Sunday's clothes.
We're going to work.

459
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,350
Loco weed, maybe?

460
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,319
They'd be all swelled up.
The tongues looks funny though.

461
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,114
They got funny looking tongues
even when they ain't dead.

462
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,709
How may do you think?

463
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,959
Must be thirty eight or forty.

464
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,031
Pa!

465
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,509
This water smells funny.

466
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,437
What?

467
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,235
Tastes funny too.

468
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,474
Like when you was a kid and
one put a penny in your mouth.

469
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,868
Like copper.

470
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,712
They're dumping stuff in this stream.

471
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,711
That may be it. What do
they call that...

472
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,350
Whatever it is. They're dumping it
in my stream. Get your horses.

473
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,351
Where we going?

474
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,795
To the copper works.
Where do you think we're going?

475
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,797
Keep the cattle away
from this stream.

476
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,552
The copper mine!
- What of it?

477
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,756
We haven't slept.
- You didn't think of that...

478
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,798
...when you were in the east
range changing the brand.

479
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,554
All right, rest them.

480
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,710
Good coffee...

481
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,069
...with a stick in it.

482
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,959
What you aiming to do, Pa?

483
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,236
Stop them.

484
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,200
Big outfit.
- So we are. Are you nervous?

485
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,159
Nope. I just thought we might
get smart for once.

486
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:26,991
How?

487
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,389
Get some law in.

488
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,756
Law!
- Get an injunction and stop them.

489
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,751
They're on our land.
- Sure, that's right.

490
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,071
In the mean time we lose four
maybe five hundred head of...

491
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,473
What's the matter with you?

492
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,359
That was a wolf.
- He wasn't doing any harm.

493
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,080
He'll kill a steer.
- Only if he's a hungry.

494
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,231
I've told you...
- How long as he's around...

495
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,152
...a coyote won't come
within 10 miles.

496
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,034
They'll pull down an animal
just to be doing something.

497
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,995
The river's full of it.

498
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,233
It's from the mine all right.

499
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,196
Hold it.

500
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,039
Sorry boys, not today.

501
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,276
I'm Matt Deveraux.
I want to see McAndrews.

502
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,034
Not today. They're paying off
up there. I got my orders.

503
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,472
I don't care what you got.
I'm going up there. Stand aside.

504
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,790
You ain't going through
this gate, don't try...

505
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,354
Better get McAndrews.

506
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,997
Round up the other boys.
- Sure, boss.

507
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,230
Deveraux...

508
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,310
...good to see you.

509
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,111
You don't come here very often.
- I'm here now. I'll tell you why.

510
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,554
I lost forty head of cattle.

511
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,551
That stuff you're pouring
poisoned'em.

512
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,557
Poison!

513
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,676
That doesn't sound right.

514
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,754
A stream's supposed to purify
itself every few yards...

515
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,036
I don't know what a stream
is supposed to do...

516
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,714
...but it's killing my cattle
and want it stopped.

517
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,869
Where you going, boys?

518
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,949
I can see how you might be annoyed.

519
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,873
Tell you what you'd better do.

520
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,674
You keep your herds away from
the stream for a while...

521
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,310
...and I'll write to
the office in Chicago...

522
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,439
...and if they'll stand still for...
- Listen to me.

523
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,319
Don't worry about
writing any letters...

524
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,357
...or about my moving my cattle.

525
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,551
The river is on my land.
You're on my land.

526
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,153
You close this operation down...

527
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,788
...till you clean that stream
or I'll close it for you.

528
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,031
And just how do you
propose to do that?

529
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,188
The first thing I'll do...

530
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,477
...is get an injunction against
you in the Federal Court.

531
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,153
Then I'll get a Deputy
Marshal to enforce it.

532
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,799
That's a fair idea.

533
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,160
If you did that, you'd throw
all these men out of work.

534
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,999
They wouldn't like that.
- You're breaking our hearts.

535
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,590
Another thing.

536
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,918
Remember that the Government's
got contracts for our ore.

537
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,915
You think the court would
give you an injunction?

538
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,920
That's the second time I've wound
up with a busted head.

539
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,719
The first time when I forgot to
check the mineral rights...

540
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,632
...and the second, of course, when...

541
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,315
...I didn't realize that they
wouldn't send a fool in charge.

542
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,394
Coming from you, that's a
very pleasant compliment.

543
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,711
We'll just see who's right.
Now listen to me, you...

544
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,996
...pasty-faced Eastern tinhorn.

545
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,039
You close this operation down or
I'll pull it down around your ears.

546
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,838
I'll be waiting here for you.

547
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,832
You're right about one thing.

548
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,715
The company didn't send
me here to be buffaloed...

549
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,633
...by a loudmouth farmer with a
sqaw for a wife and a half...

550
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,275
Go ahead...

551
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,396
...pull it.

552
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,553
Draw and I'll blow your head off.

553
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,238
Cut it out, Joe. Put it away, Ben.

554
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,914
There's not going to be any
shooting. You've been warned.

555
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,951
Close it down or we'll be back. If I
come back I'll be looking for you.

556
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,117
Let's go.

557
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,598
Stay close to me. Walk slow.

558
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,116
Get them!

559
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,638
We ain't got a chance, Pa.
- Shut up!

560
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,393
Rush them, you fools! Rush them!

561
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,755
Shoot at their feet!

562
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,955
Make for the horses!

563
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,998
Wreck it! Tear it down!

564
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,431
Go!

565
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,438
All here?
- Some hurt, not bad.

566
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,029
Where'd you come from?

567
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,838
I think maybe trouble.
We follow you.

568
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,513
We wait, hear shooting, we come.

569
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,710
All right, go ahead.

570
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,034
They're not going to like that, Pa.
- I'll bet they're not.

571
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,392
They'll think twice before
they dump in my stream.

572
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,199
They won't think twice about
starting legal action.

573
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,233
That's not my worry.
Let Lawton about that.

574
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,795
Ride back to the ranch and tell him.
- Right.

575
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,991
If he's not there, go into
town and find him.

576
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,149
I'll ride in with you.

577
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,833
Me too.
- You're going to ride herd.

578
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,911
We got keep the stock
away from the stream.

579
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,031
Holy crow, don't he ever give up?

580
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,315
What're you doing here?

581
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,468
Looking at your horses.

582
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,630
Isn't it allowed?

583
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,313
You mean you were there with King?

584
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,471
He's a stallion.
He could kick your head.

585
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,153
You sound as if you wished he had.

586
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,235
He happens to know a lady
when he sees one.

587
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,630
Which is more than you can
say for the rest of us.

588
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,309
You're saying it, not me.

589
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,152
Where's Lawton, up at the main house?

590
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,039
No, he went into town with
Dad early this morning.

591
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,030
What about you?

592
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,276
I just didn't feel like
getting up that early.

593
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,597
You didn't figure we might
be riding today, did you?

594
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,155
Well of all the gall.

595
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,837
For your information I've already
asked for someone to drive me in.

596
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,471
Yes.

597
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,118
Might I ask how you
happen to be here?

598
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,156
Me.

599
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,992
Pa wanted me to see Lawton and I...

600
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,391
...just had a feeling that
you might still be here.

601
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,195
And you're, aren't you?

602
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,479
Yes, I'm here.

603
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,430
And you did figure that I might
ride in, didn't you?

604
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,436
Why?

605
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,154
Why did you ride in?

606
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,275
Ma, tell Pa I'll try and make
it back by suppertime.

607
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,554
I've got a feeling your mother
doesn't approve of this.

608
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,109
Or me either.
- Lf she didn't, she'd say so.

609
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,629
She never says anything.

610
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,669
She always seems to know just
what you're thinking.

611
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,672
I thought that too when I was a kid.

612
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,239
It's only because she's Indian.

613
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,473
I'd almost forgotten that.

614
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,431
But everyone call her 'Señora'. Why?

615
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,473
People like to pretend she's
Spanish, thinking it looks better.

616
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,709
Pa likes it.

617
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,354
Pa don't give a rip what they think.
- What do you mean?

618
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,436
You know.

619
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,757
If I did, I wouldn't have asked you.

620
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,796
Well.

621
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,508
Though you've been away...

622
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,513
...you should know that a white man
doesn't marry and Indian...

623
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,113
...even the daughter of a chief.

624
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,510
They call him a sqawman
and his kids breeds.

625
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,310
I'm a half-breed.

626
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,795
All right.

627
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,038
But does anyone call you that?

628
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,633
No since my first day in school.

629
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,833
But it still bothers you.
- No, why should it?

630
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,710
Yeah...

631
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,274
...I guess it does sometimes.

632
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,750
Was your mother really
the daughter of a chief?

633
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,556
He ran this whole territory.

634
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,353
I was named after his father...

635
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,790
...Tuekakas, Chief Joseph.
- I've heard of him.

636
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,916
They didn't want Pa
to marry the Princess.

637
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,390
A wild Irishman with a
few head of cattle...

638
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,834
...and three motherless kids.

639
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,797
The old chiefs were opposed to him.

640
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,597
So?

641
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,711
Pa'd tell it to you with
the trimmings...

642
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,798
...how he, rassled a bear,
and whipped six braves...

643
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,951
...so they allowed him
to marry the Princess.

644
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,396
Wonderful.

645
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,398
I'll bet he did it all too.

646
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,155
What about his family?

647
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,231
I never did hear much about them.

648
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,478
Ellen, his first wife, died right
after they came out here.

649
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,312
Came out from where?
- I don't know.

650
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,676
East, I guess.

651
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,195
His father, a farmer, left Ireland
during the famine.

652
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,555
Dirt farmer or something.

653
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,359
Were kicked by a mule when
Pa was just a pup and...

654
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,109
What're you laughing at?

655
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,755
I thought you were worried
about being an Indian.

656
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,353
You just don't like being Irish.

657
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,836
If I were you I wouldn't
try to rush things.

658
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,436
Let me talk to Deveraux
myself and see if...

659
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,989
There's one of them now.

660
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,994
Yes, so it is.

661
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,549
Isn't that your daughter?

662
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,109
Yes, it is.

663
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,831
You're making too much
out of this, Horace.

664
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,873
They're a little hot under the
collar, but they'll calm down.

665
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,237
Talk to'em nicely and they'll
settle. They want no trouble.

666
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,914
I tell you they're going to
sue you. They're mad, Matt.

667
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,955
You wrecked a building...

668
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,271
...banged up half their crew.
- They killed 40 of my cattle.

669
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,668
What should I do, kiss'em?

670
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,909
I'll pay for the damages,
if they're fair.

671
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,118
And if they put in a sump and
stop polluting my stream.

672
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,350
Going to court is a waste
of their time and mine.

673
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,398
They don't care about that.
They're out to get you.

674
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,915
This is a big company.

675
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,036
They dislike the shooting
in their property.

676
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,633
They'll make an example of you.

677
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,949
Do you think they can?

678
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:14,757
Well.

679
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,191
That depends on what
happens in court.

680
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,958
What lawyers they bring in and...

681
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,758
...who the judge is. You know.

682
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,830
Well...

683
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,917
...you could do something about that.

684
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,308
This is a federal case...

685
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,040
...with eastern lawyers,
the papers will pick it up.

686
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,709
If this was just a...

687
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,440
...local thing, we could handle it.
- Horace...

688
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,713
...I don't know but...

689
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,792
...something sounds sour to me.

690
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,032
You made the wrong move
with the wrong people.

691
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,236
I've mad a lot of wrong
moves, Horace.

692
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,950
You know, it isn't that,
it's you, Horace.

693
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,708
Sometimes you helped,
sometimes you couldn't.

694
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,189
That's all right, but...

695
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,591
...you're not even pretending
now that you want to help me.

696
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,309
You could appoint the judge,
couldn't you, Horace?

697
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,392
I suppose I could.

698
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,313
It couldn't be quite ethical but...
- Never mind about that.

699
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,152
Let's talk about you and me.

700
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,555
You want something.
What is it? What do you want?

701
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,190
I want your son Joe to stay
away from my daughter.

702
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,996
I ought to kill you,
Horace, right now.

703
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,873
No! No!

704
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,551
Not you. After all these years.

705
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,596
Matt!

706
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,709
I don't care what the newspaper
and the town say...

707
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,156
...or the fact that Lawton's wife is
sick every time we ask them.

708
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,390
You!

709
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,314
You never could understand
why I married her.

710
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,316
And you never liked this country
out here, did you, Horace?

711
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,591
That's why you sent
the girl back east.

712
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,119
To get her away from
the dust, the cattle...

713
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,748
...the Indians and the half-breed.
- Matt, don't.

714
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,233
I like the boy, but...

715
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,551
...this is something that's born
and bred in me, I'm 56.

716
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,631
I tried to change but...
- You're 56...

717
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,472
...and you're Governor of the state!

718
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,118
And who made you Governor?
I took you off of a...

719
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,556
...accountant's stool and pulled a
pencil out from behind your ear...

720
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,039
...and made you a politician.

721
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,674
I made you mayor.

722
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,474
I sent you to Congress and
I put you in that chair.

723
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,879
Fifty-six years...

724
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,837
Fifty six, you owe me thirty of them.

725
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,869
You're right, I do.

726
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,792
You've done everything but change me.

727
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,309
I wish you had.

728
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,988
And maybe I will.

729
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,756
Maybe I will. I can still pull that
chair right out from under you.

730
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,315
Maybe I will.

731
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,471
But I'll do something else first.

732
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,029
I'll tell my boy that if he wants
your girl, to take her...

733
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,318
...if he has to pull her out of the
house by the hair of her head.

734
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,150
Dead beat?

735
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,315
I guess so.

736
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,719
I'll show you something.

737
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,670
Go on.

738
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,158
That's wonderful. And cold!
- Comes from away up.

739
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,749
It's beautiful here.

740
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,315
How did you ever find it?

741
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,233
I've known it since I was a kid.

742
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,234
This is where Pa'd his first
powwow with the tribes...

743
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,628
...and saw my mother.

744
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,869
There used to be a stone
that marked the place...

745
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,315
...where the old Indians made
a deal for the land.

746
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,755
I don't come frequently.
- Don't you come here often?

747
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,435
No, it's sort of out of the way.
- Then why did you bring me here?

748
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,510
I don't know. We were
out this way and...

749
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,755
No other reason?

750
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,238
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea.

751
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,439
I just don't understand you.

752
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,392
Four days ago you behaved as if I
were a girl in a dance hall...

753
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,790
...and now...

754
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,992
Four days ago I wasn't
in love with you.

755
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,469
Was it that hard to say?

756
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,756
You don't know about what
you're finding out...

757
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,512
...of what they'll say...
- Yes I do.

758
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,749
Just as your mother did.

759
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,870
Should I go in and talk to him?
- Nope.

760
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,158
Don't you start getting honourable.

761
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,759
I need time to work on him.

762
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,114
Unless you really want to?

763
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,799
I'd rather rassle a bear.

764
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,036
Joe!

765
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,390
Come in here, this concerns you too.

766
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,236
The Mining Company has filed a
claim against us in the Court.

767
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,913
Clem thinks we're in real trouble.

768
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,151
You'll be if they get a
judgment against you.

769
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,635
I don't know if they...
- Then why bother with it?

770
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,030
Because no lawyer guarantees
what a jury'll do.

771
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,795
As I said, if Horace were
appointing the Judge...

772
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,837
He isn't, and I'm not
gonna ask him to.

773
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,877
I still think we've got a good case.
If I didn't I've told you so...

774
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,513
...but I want you to be protected
against any eventuality.

775
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,153
You insure yourself against
accident and death.

776
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,230
No.

777
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,992
What is it, Mr. Lawton?

778
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,160
If he splits the property
between you...

779
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:10,710
...he won't be the sole owner.
- You're wasting your time...

780
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,310
...because he doesn't trust any of
us with more that 40 a month!

781
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,356
Sit down!

782
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,879
What about Ma, couldn't she...?

783
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,275
No, Joseph.

784
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,835
Well...

785
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,314
You see, Joe, it's...

786
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,834
The government doesn't allow
an Indian to hold land.

787
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,356
What about me?

788
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,514
That's different, you can.

789
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:36,355
He won't turn a thing over to us.
- I'll make decisions around here!

790
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,875
Get out of here! I'll think it over.

791
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,870
Joe!

792
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,909
Come here, will you?

793
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,512
There's something I want to ask you.

794
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:53,950
Yes, Pa?

795
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,478
Never mind. It's not important.

796
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:35,719
I take it the death of these 40
cattle was important to you?

797
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,799
The death of one cow is important
to a cattleman, sonny.

798
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,875
Important enough to send
you to the mine...

799
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,315
...where 12 men were injured?

800
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,151
Yep.

801
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,278
You consider 40 cattle more
important than the lives...

802
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,908
...of 12 men occupied in making...
- Objection.

803
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,272
Prosecution is trying...
- Let him go.

804
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,154
I'm willing to answer any questions.

805
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:02,198
That sound like pure
nonsense, sonny...

806
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,354
...but I know the difference
between cattle and people...

807
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,873
...as any man can tell you.

808
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,310
Thank you.

809
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,950
How many head of cattle have you
at this time, Mr. Deveraux?

810
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,038
45,000 or 50,000.

811
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,838
You don't know exactly?

812
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,114
There're the books of my Ranch.
Why don't you look it up?

813
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,394
I don't want to look it up.
I want you to tell me.

814
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,788
Then you'd better change
the tone of your voice, sonny.

815
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,394
Will you ask for a directly answer?
- I already have.

816
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,633
Mr. Van Cleve, unless you have a
a specific reason for pursuing...

817
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,791
...the book...
- I've a specific reason.

818
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,671
The defense has stressed
the importance of 40 animals.

819
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,752
Yet the witness can't tell me...
- Objection.

820
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,915
Prosecution wants to discredit the
witness by indirect examination.

821
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:50,751
Sustained.

822
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,312
Your Honor, I don't understand
this legal hocus-pocus...

823
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,519
...but I'm willing to tell this
fellow about my cattle.

824
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,638
I don't keep any books
in my head but...

825
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,509
...every cow on my Ranch
is important to me.

826
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,513
Important to other people too.

827
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,240
I ship 10,000 head to Kansas
City every year.

828
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,318
My cows goes into every
city in the East.

829
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,916
It feeds over 200,000 people.

830
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,318
That's may line of work, sonny.

831
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,072
We're all very grateful for
this additional information.

832
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:29,837
But could we confine ourselves
to specific answers? Thank you.

833
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,835
You've stated you built up you
ranch over a period of 25 years?

834
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,789
Approximately.

835
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,594
During this time you've had
other disputes over...

836
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,399
...prior claims and water rights?
- Plenty.

837
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,197
Were they settled in court?
- No.

838
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,794
This is the first time
I've ever been to court.

839
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,475
Usually the men I had to deal with...

840
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,916
...were men enough to stand
up and argue it out.

841
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:54,990
I see.

842
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,873
Do you happen to remember the
name of Lucius Hennaberry?

843
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,508
Yes, I remember him.

844
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:03,990
Do you remember shooting
him in White's saloon?

845
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,388
In a fair fight.

846
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,430
Objection.

847
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,439
Your Honor, I can see no reason
for this line of question.

848
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,591
I demand.
- It's an integral part of the case.

849
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,915
If the Court allow me to proceed
I'll so demostrate.

850
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:15,990
Proceed.

851
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,150
Thank you, Sir.

852
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,349
The dispute between you and
Hennaberry was over a water right.

853
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,193
No. Not over water rights
just over water.

854
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,196
Luke said he was going to
water his herd on my ranch.

855
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,069
He didn't.

856
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:35,078
Judging from the results,
that seems obvious.

857
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,992
Water seems to play a important
part in your life.

858
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,513
I don't quite understand this.

859
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:44,038
Seeing as how you came here
on a train, all nice...

860
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,475
...and comfortable like, why,
I can understand that.

861
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,115
But you see, I didn't.

862
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,874
I packed in here with a
wife and three kids.

863
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:54,595
The first year I lost my herd and
the second I lost my wife...

864
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,113
...because there was no water.

865
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,956
Water's important to me like it is
to everybody else in the state.

866
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,151
Without water there'd be no state!

867
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,198
Your Honor, please...
- You asked me, I'll answer.

868
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,674
You can bet your hat water's
important to me...

869
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,871
...as it is to everybody
else in the state.

870
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:15,308
Every drop on my ranch I either
dug for or channeled in.

871
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,314
When you're back on that train
riding out of here...

872
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,391
...over the right of way
that I gave'em...

873
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,516
...think it over.

874
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:27,075
I concede Mr. Deveraux's
contribution to his state...

875
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,039
...but that does not give him
the right to flout the laws...

876
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,355
...of this state.
- Object.

877
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,350
Sustained.

878
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,636
Just keep to direct questioning.

879
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,670
I'm sorry.

880
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:42,550
Do you remember the names
of Charlie Munger...

881
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,518
...Red Dog Johnson,
or Carlos Ramirez?

882
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,556
No.

883
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,556
The incident may be
too trivial to recall.

884
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:54,349
But isn't it true that you summarily
hanged all these men...

885
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,351
...on June...
- They were stealing cattle.

886
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,909
Did you just remind'em?
- I didn't ask'em their names.

887
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:02,277
You just hung them.
- They were thieves.

888
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:03,829
I see.

889
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:09,194
Wasn't Charles Malone
sheriff at that time?

890
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,915
I guess he was.
- Did you try to contact him?

891
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,149
No.
- Why not?

892
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,072
He was 40 miles away and drunk.

893
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:18,597
Do you know this for a fact?
- I knew Charlie Malone.

894
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:22,719
Have you ever, during your
years on Deveraux Ranch...

895
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,350
...called in legal authorities?
- Lf I've needed them...

896
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,909
...l've asked for them.
- Why didn't you ask for 'em...

897
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,832
...two weeks ago?
- It wasn't necessary!

898
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,149
Order! ¡Order!

899
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,590
If there's any more of this,
I'll see you in my chambers.

900
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:41,673
If you can't restrain yourself,
I hold you in contempt.

901
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,156
Proceed.

902
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,434
You say you've asked
for the authorities.

903
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,035
That's right.
- Did you attempt...

904
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,839
...to notify the present
sheriff this time?

905
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,589
No.
- Why not?

906
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,231
I didn't think it was necessary.

907
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,994
You stated that it was
your intention...

908
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:03,277
...to discuss with McAndrews and
arrive at a sensible solution.

909
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,716
Do you still say that
this was your intent?

910
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,075
Yes.
- Then how it happened...

911
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,435
...that 20 minutes after
you arrive at the mine...

912
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,194
...your formal appear
with 30 armed men?

913
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,472
Maybe he thought there
was any trouble.

914
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:18,074
Did he know there was any and
you warned to be there?

915
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,514
No, I did not.

916
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:21,796
I see.

917
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,591
Is it customary on Deveraux Ranch
to proceed without orders?

918
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,228
It isn't customary but...
- Yes, Mr. Deveraux?

919
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:31,712
I didn't have to say anything to him.

920
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,396
I see.

921
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,838
Suppose I didn't believe that.

922
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,912
Suppose I say that you
deliberately caused the trouble...

923
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:43,238
...to bully and force McAndrews
in a opened fight.

924
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,519
Suppose I say to the jury you're
lying, aren't you?

925
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,148
Then I would tell you to get
a gun or leave town...

926
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:54,631
...because when I leave here I'll
chase you until your heels smoke!

927
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,472
Got get'em
- Thatta boy, Matt.

928
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,479
Order! Order!

929
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,871
Mr. Deveraux, I hold you in contempt.

930
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,469
This court will be in
recess for an hour.

931
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,199
One more disturbance...

932
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:11,830
...and the rest of the proceeding
will be made to closed door.

933
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,549
Matt, come on.

934
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,150
That did it. He hasn't got a chance.

935
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,355
What're we going to do?

936
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:23,676
What can we do?

937
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,675
Lawton said they'd to prove
him solely responsible.

938
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,956
He was, wasn't he?
- We were all with him.

939
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,153
I never asked to go.
- Me neither.

940
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:34,869
They'll put him in jail.

941
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,270
Look, Joe...

942
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,513
...l'd do anything to help him...
- So would l, Joe...

943
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,319
...but we can't just say...
- They'd arrest us for perjury.

944
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,230
That's right.

945
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:45,916
Yeah.

946
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:47,795
I'm going to get a smoke.

947
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:48,955
Me, too.

948
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,039
We got to do something, Ben.

949
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,110
Why?

950
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:58,438
They'll put him in jail.
- No.

951
01:01:58,720 --> 01:01:59,436
Not him.

952
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,591
We got to do something,
we owe it to him.

953
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,716
Maybe you do, Joe, but not me.

954
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,395
You heard him up there...

955
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,837
You heard him telling
about his cattle...

956
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,673
...and his wife, and going
it alone with three kids.

957
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:16,192
What do you think we did while
he was building up the state?

958
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,756
I worked 16 hours a day for him
when I was ten years old.

959
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:25,594
And all he ever did was
treat me like a hired hand.

960
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,796
Ben, listen...
- You don't know about that.

961
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,996
You came along later
when things were good.

962
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,391
So you figure you owe him something.

963
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,756
All right, go ahead,
do anything you like.

964
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,839
You're his little pet...

965
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:43,433
...you always were.

966
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,512
It looks bad, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

967
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:00,235
I'm sorry about the judge.
- Yeah, he's tough.

968
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,239
I mean about Dad.

969
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,515
What about him?

970
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,149
Why, about him having
the fight with your father...

971
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:09,551
...and refused to appoint the judge.
- He fought with Pa? What about?

972
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:11,590
Us.

973
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:12,869
Well, was it?

974
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:16,237
I thought he must have told you.

975
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,391
Where are you going?
- I've got to see Lawton!

976
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:29,876
Well?

977
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,832
It's all right. I made
a deal with them.

978
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,590
You'll have to give up
the land the mine is on.

979
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,671
Give up the land!
- Then you'll got to jail.

980
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,193
Look.
- Will you listen to me!

981
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:41,230
All right.

982
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,792
You give'em the title
to the mine...

983
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,912
...and pay the injured men and the
costs on the wrecked building.

984
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,274
We can work that out later.

985
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,274
That wrecked building is worth...
- There's one more thing.

986
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,472
I'm going to put Joe on the stand.

987
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:54,829
Why?
- Somebody...

988
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,149
...must be responsible...

989
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,435
Not Joe!
- Wait a minute!

990
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,277
I just talked to him.
He wants to do it.

991
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,872
He says McAndrews
called him a half-breed.

992
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,391
He says...
- Joe is not going on the stand!

993
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,150
Look, Matt...

994
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,159
This is a deal.
Somebody has to do this.

995
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,272
You just destroyed any
chance you had.

996
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,594
If they convict Joe,
we can appeal it.

997
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,517
If you give up the land,
they won't contest the appeal.

998
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:25,669
The worst that can happen is that
Joe will be held for a few weeks.

999
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,357
I don't like this.
- I don't ask you that!

1000
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:30,590
I'm just asking you to
take some advice!

1001
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,035
The court is now in session.

1002
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,552
Please come to order.

1003
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,830
I'm going to call
the boy to the stand.

1004
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,240
If you say one word
until after the appeal...

1005
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:46,312
...it'll mean at least ten
years behind bars.

1006
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:54,919
Call Joseph Deveraux.

1007
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,636
Defense calls Joseph Deveraux.

1008
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,558
Take the stand, please.

1009
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,435
Do you swear...

1010
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:10,915
...to tell truth...

1011
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,589
...the whole truth...

1012
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,592
...and nothing but the truth?

1013
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,918
We can't do anything more, Pa.
- Get away from me!

1014
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,832
I don't want to talk to any of you!

1015
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,789
Get away from me!

1016
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,914
You are making yourself
ill, my husband.

1017
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,151
Please! This will pass!

1018
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:54,710
Two Moons said Lawton
brought some papers.

1019
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,154
They're here, I will get'em.

1020
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,716
And food.
- No food, just the papers.

1021
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,348
But you must eat.
- I sent Two Moons to look for 'em.

1022
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,391
They're still your sons.

1023
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:10,075
Please send them to me
when the come, 'Señora'.

1024
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,909
You wanted us?

1025
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,239
No, I don't want you.

1026
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,277
I told you to come here. Sit down.

1027
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:37,911
All right.

1028
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,435
What is it, Pa?

1029
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:48,830
Papers.

1030
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,309
Lawton wrote'em.

1031
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,830
It's an agreement to keep
Joe out of jail.

1032
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:57,115
You own the property, so you sign
them. Here you, make your mark.

1033
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:58,994
I can write.

1034
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:02,795
How much, Pa?

1035
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,228
80,000 cash and the mine property.

1036
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:07,396
Sign it!

1037
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:08,671
No.

1038
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,556
Is too much, Pa, get
them to cut it down.

1039
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,395
Why you...?

1040
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:17,993
This is to keep Joe
out of jail. Sign it!

1041
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:19,390
No!

1042
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:22,718
We are not gonna sign it, Pa.

1043
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:27,039
You'll sign these papers
or I'll kill skin the lot of you!

1044
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,998
We decided we're not gonna
sign, it's too much money.

1045
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,470
Joe'll only get 7 or 6 month.
- Sign it!

1046
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:35,994
Take it easy, Pa.

1047
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:39,072
It won't do you any good to
get yourself wound up...

1048
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,150
Get him to bed.

1049
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,479
I'll send for the doctor.

1050
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,273
You, Deveraux!

1051
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:16,509
Come on down.

1052
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,514
You got a visitor...

1053
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:28,955
...a pretty one.

1054
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,599
No.
- Joe, don't give me no trouble.

1055
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:52,116
Joe!

1056
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:53,910
Yeah, it's me.

1057
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:56,237
Get out!

1058
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:59,280
Orders are to stay with prisoner.
- Get out, now!

1059
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,679
Joe, ¿what's the matter?

1060
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,996
What are they doing to you?
- Nothing!

1061
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,879
Nobody's doing anything to me.

1062
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:15,468
I was working and it's hot.

1063
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,553
I don't understand, Joe.
- I'm a convict.

1064
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:23,111
I work and eat here and sleeps
in these stinking clothes.

1065
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,313
My darling...

1066
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:28,799
...as if that could...

1067
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,319
You shouldn't have come here.

1068
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,029
Don't do it again.

1069
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:37,879
Shouldn't have come?

1070
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:39,390
Why not?

1071
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,478
Three years isn't forever, Joe.

1072
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,315
No matter how hard it is, I can...
- It isn't hard.

1073
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,035
It's just being here, and
not being able to get out.

1074
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,549
Is it your father?

1075
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:56,315
He's been sick but he's been...
- I know about it.

1076
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,558
Two Moons has been here. I know
what they're doing to the old man.

1077
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,274
They killing him, just little by
little, day by day...

1078
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,794
...they're tearing him apart.

1079
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,757
While I'm in this...
- Joe, stop it!

1080
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:10,398
Stop thinking about your father and
your brothers and the crazy ranch.

1081
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,756
Forget it, you've got your own life.
- Forget it?

1082
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,717
That's what keeps me going.
- But...

1083
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,314
...it's insane to brood for 3 years.

1084
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:19,195
Joe...

1085
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:20,755
...please...

1086
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,836
...when you get out, we'll go away.

1087
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,798
Just the two of us, any place...
- Stop it!

1088
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,871
You're going to be on the outside,
with people, free to move around.

1089
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,075
I can wait.

1090
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:33,509
Maybe you can.

1091
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:35,759
I'm not so sure about me.

1092
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,110
When I see you...

1093
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:48,829
Now do you understand?

1094
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,913
Don't come here again.

1095
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:10,150
Stay here.

1096
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,468
He's coming.

1097
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:18,269
I know he's coming, but
when? I want him now.

1098
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:19,316
He's here.

1099
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:21,829
Please, my husband...

1100
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,229
...no more quarrels.

1101
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,438
Try to understand him a little.

1102
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:36,516
Hello, Ma.

1103
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:39,391
Pa.

1104
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:44,511
Leave us alone, will you 'Señora'?

1105
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:54,909
Sit down, Ben.

1106
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:56,709
This is all right.

1107
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,993
What's on your mind, Pa?

1108
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,555
The land.

1109
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,878
They tell me you're selling
some to an oil company.

1110
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,310
That's right.

1111
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,276
Why?

1112
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,558
We need the money to operate with.

1113
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,758
To operate that office in town?

1114
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:15,031
Yeah.

1115
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:18,989
Why didn't you tell me?

1116
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:20,949
You wouldn't like it...

1117
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:25,671
...and the Doc says it's
bad for you get riled up.

1118
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,156
Yeah.

1119
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,755
You're real concerned about
my health, aren't you?

1120
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,230
I don't like it. I don't
like selling the land.

1121
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,232
It's good business for the ranch.

1122
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,079
I'm selling it, Pa.

1123
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,593
It's yours to sell.

1124
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:51,910
I spent my life building it for
you and the others, but...

1125
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:58,310
I've been rough on you, Ben,
because you were...

1126
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,069
...the oldest.

1127
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:03,638
I guess I felt I could
expect more from you.

1128
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,468
I never did this before,
but I'm doing it now.

1129
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,278
I'm asking you, Ben.

1130
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,756
Give up this sale, will you?

1131
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:17,511
No.

1132
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,595
It figured.

1133
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,912
I always knew there was something
between us, some way.

1134
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,990
What is it, Ben? What is it?
Joe, maybe, Ben? Joe?

1135
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,751
Because he's smarter
than the rest of you?

1136
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,757
Because he stood up to me when
the rest of you were afraid to?

1137
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,872
You hate Joe, don't you, Ben?

1138
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:46,317
No, I never hated Joe.

1139
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,270
Me, then.

1140
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,033
I'm no trouble to you now.
- No, not now...

1141
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,434
...because you're old
and crippled and sick.

1142
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,639
So now you call me in and ask me
something. You're a little late.

1143
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,395
Did you ask me how I'd like and
Indian stepmother after Ma died?

1144
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:10,189
Or how I liked doing all the chores
and caring for Mike and Denny?

1145
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:14,399
Or how I liked quitting
school to work for you?

1146
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,598
Did you ever in your life...

1147
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:20,996
...ask me how I felt or what
I thought? What I wanted?

1148
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,273
No, you didn't.

1149
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:28,356
So, it's...

1150
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,910
...it's a little late
for asking now, Pa.

1151
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:40,511
But the gate is always open, Ben...

1152
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:44,077
...you could have left. I would
have understood that...

1153
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,639
...I did it myself.

1154
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,235
I always used to think there was...

1155
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:55,358
...too much of me in you
for us to hit it off.

1156
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:58,111
But I know now that was wrong.

1157
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:04,111
There wasn't enough of me in you.
Now I'm telling you again.

1158
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,669
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.

1159
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,913
You're not going to sell any
of the Deveraux Ranch.

1160
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,597
Because I'll stop you, Ben.

1161
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,389
I'll stop you!
- Sit down, Pa.

1162
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,195
You're not telling anybody
anything anymore.

1163
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:23,711
I run Deveraux Ranch
and I run it the way I like.

1164
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:29,558
And right now I'm riding
into town to sign a deal.

1165
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:44,475
'Señora'!

1166
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:46,796
Two Moons!

1167
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,273
Two Moons, get my horse.

1168
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,675
'Señor' Matt, to ride
the horse is death.

1169
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,554
He's right. It will kill
you, my husband.

1170
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:59,673
What difference does it make?

1171
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:02,435
If you die...

1172
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:03,636
...I die.

1173
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,034
'Señora'...

1174
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,068
...this must be done.

1175
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:12,789
You understand?

1176
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,549
Ben!

1177
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:52,830
Ain't that Pa?

1178
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:56,557
Yeah.

1179
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,395
He's trying to head
us off. Come on!

1180
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,197
He's got us, Ben!
- Hold it still!

1181
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:11,516
Mike!

1182
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:26,515
Is he dead, Ben?

1183
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,399
I wonder how long?

1184
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,396
Go on back to the ranch
and get a buckboard.

1185
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,675
Do you wan't that we stay here?
- No, go on back.

1186
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:44,636
Both of you.

1187
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:52,913
I'm sorry it had to be this way, Joe.

1188
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:57,676
No!

1189
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:00,309
No more of this!

1190
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:02,035
You are brothers.

1191
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,316
Joseph.

1192
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:19,356
Ma!

1193
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:25,159
Ma!
- My son! My son!

1194
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,675
You've changed.

1195
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:31,230
Not much.

1196
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,911
What about you? These clothes...

1197
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:35,548
When your father died...

1198
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,274
...I went back to my people.

1199
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:39,394
To die, too, I think.

1200
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:41,999
But I knew I must see you.

1201
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,397
What do you do with the gun?

1202
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:47,870
It's his.

1203
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,593
It's all he had when he started.

1204
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:51,795
I'm starting too.

1205
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,149
That's not a start.

1206
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,435
It is the end.

1207
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,831
To take that is blood.
- They killed him.

1208
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:57,796
Ben did.

1209
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:58,710
Slow death!

1210
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,711
You saw it happen.
You know what they did.

1211
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,632
You're speaking like
a boy, my son...

1212
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:05,993
...and you should already be a man.
- You don't understand.

1213
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:07,229
Listen to me.

1214
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,915
He was my husband for 25 years.

1215
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,910
I loved him more than
anything in the world.

1216
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,917
Perhaps even more than you, Joseph.

1217
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:20,475
I know, Ma.

1218
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:23,831
You think to take up
his gun and his life.

1219
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:28,278
You cannot, Joseph.
It is finished with him.

1220
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:30,593
You must make your own life.

1221
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:32,590
Go away.

1222
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:34,868
Take the girl with you.

1223
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:36,596
Barbara?

1224
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,512
She has come to me may times.

1225
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:40,590
For her, too...

1226
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:42,519
...there can only be one.

1227
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,314
Take her away, Joseph.

1228
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,074
And when you're together...

1229
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:48,231
...you'll now there's not
need for blood...

1230
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:49,870
...nor for him...

1231
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:53,910
...nor for that.

1232
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:57,390
Give it to me.

1233
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:16,355
What about you, Ma?

1234
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:19,830
There is no longer need
for me, my son.

1235
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,073
Keep riding, Joe.

1236
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:39,875
Get going.

1237
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:47,433
There's no need for this, I made
up my mind. I'm pulling out.

1238
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:51,071
You missed your train.
- I' don't need any.

1239
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:53,674
I said I'm leaving.
- I believe you.

1240
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,433
But for how long?

1241
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,238
What do you mean?
- Just that.

1242
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:01,070
I could never be sure when
you might get an idea.

1243
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:04,472
There's always that lance
you threw at my feet that day...

1244
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:06,870
That was an old Comanche sign.
- Sure, I know that.

1245
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,670
You see, I'm mighty superstitious.

1246
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:11,993
I got to thinking about it.

1247
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:15,830
I figured I might not sleep good
nights, worrying about you.

1248
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:20,798
I slept awful good these past years.
- You're crazy, Ben, you...

1249
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:23,359
Take it easy, Joe.

1250
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,598
Just swing off there...

1251
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:28,479
...we'll get up into the hills.

1252
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:29,636
Move!

1253
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:38,314
You won't get away with it.
You could cut your own throat.

1254
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:39,310
May be.

1255
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,911
No sense you worrying
about it though.

1256
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:44,395
What about Denny and Mike?
You can't keep'em quiet.

1257
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:45,909
I sent them into town.

1258
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:49,114
I know better than to let them
in on anything like this.

1259
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,831
I could have saved you
the trouble, Joe.

1260
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:51,152
It's lovely and peaceful here.

1261
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:54,553
Doesn't seem to go with Pa,
somehow, but you can't tell.

1262
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:56,839
