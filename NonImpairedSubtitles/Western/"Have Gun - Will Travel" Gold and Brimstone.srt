1
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,292
Get away!

2
00:00:45,394 --> 00:00:47,294
There ain't no gold up here!

3
00:00:47,396 --> 00:00:49,096
Do you hear me?

4
00:00:49,197 --> 00:00:51,533
I hear you, old man.
But I don't believe you.

5
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,467
I know there's gold up there.

6
00:00:53,569 --> 00:00:56,004
What are we
going to do, son?

7
00:00:56,104 --> 00:00:57,906
You got to figure something.

8
00:00:58,007 --> 00:01:00,207
You was wrong, pa!
Like usual.

9
00:01:00,308 --> 00:01:03,110
You said lucifer's pit
was going to be a bonanza.

10
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:05,079
Please, pa...

11
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,750
Let them have the mine, or
lucifer's pit's gonna be our grave!

12
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:11,619
You got no right to it!
I found it.

13
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,755
I found it!

14
00:01:13,856 --> 00:01:16,958
We found you, old man.

15
00:01:17,059 --> 00:01:19,627
We got the water
and the supplies.

16
00:01:19,728 --> 00:01:21,813
Ain't but one way down.

17
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,390
Pa...

18
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:34,258
Maybe we ought
to call it quits.

19
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,394
No, we'll come out
all right, you'll see.

20
00:01:36,495 --> 00:01:38,095
see?

21
00:01:38,197 --> 00:01:40,264
See what they call
this place?

22
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:43,000
Lucifer's pit.
This is his spread.

23
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:44,669
He'll bring us the luck.

24
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,707
I'll settle for
the devil's luck.

25
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:51,876
I'd sell our souls to satan,

26
00:01:51,977 --> 00:01:54,145
Before I give up.

27
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:06,257
Where you come from?

28
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,327
Came from below, through those
rocks. What are you doing here?

29
00:02:09,428 --> 00:02:12,063
I heard shooting and noise,
thought I could help.

30
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:13,998
I can help people sometimes.

31
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,200
Who are you?

32
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,676
Paladin.
That's right.

33
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,444
No, I don't want
any part of it!

34
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:28,513
We can use all the help
we can get.

35
00:02:28,614 --> 00:02:31,483
I haven't offered you any help.
My help isn't for everyone,

36
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,586
And there's a stiff price.
We'll pay your price.

37
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,654
What do they want?

38
00:02:36,755 --> 00:02:38,823
They're trying to jump
this claim.

39
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:40,992
I found it, it's mine!

40
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:43,194
They can't get away with it!

41
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:45,129
Blast 'em. Scatter 'em.

42
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,533
Halt 'em with brimstone!

43
00:02:48,634 --> 00:02:50,535
Brimstone,
that's what I smell.

44
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:52,670
Yes.

45
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,739
Brimstone and hellfire.

46
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,509
He shall walk among you
under many names.

47
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,311
I told you
the luck would change.

48
00:03:00,412 --> 00:03:03,397
It was the brimstone.
You can smell it!

49
00:03:03,498 --> 00:03:06,200
It was some loose powder,
from a broken shell.

50
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:08,402
We don't want
any help from you!

51
00:03:08,503 --> 00:03:10,822
How do we even know
who you are?

52
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:12,590
I know.

53
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:14,459
I know.

54
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,828
You know.
What do you know?

55
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:18,696
That we starved
all our lives,

56
00:03:18,797 --> 00:03:20,665
Chasing after
your cursed luck!

57
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:22,701
No fancy black devil is going
to jump out of lucifer's pit

58
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,368
To save our necks!

59
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,005
I'm through,
do you hear me?

60
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,774
You do like I say, son.
Like you always done.

61
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:35,346
He heard, he came.
You can't quit me now.

62
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:38,500
We got the luck.
He's here.

63
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:40,701
Well, you tell him, mister.

64
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:44,755
Tell him that you
ain't the devil!

65
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,575
Now why should I
tell him that?

66
00:03:51,763 --> 00:03:54,783
I tell you, there's
three men up there now.

67
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:57,018
Can't be, rudy.

68
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:59,287
I saw them!
I'm sure of that.

69
00:03:59,388 --> 00:04:02,190
I say rush 'em.
And maybe get shot?

70
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,226
No... Look, we can
wait 'em out.

71
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:07,328
We got all the water
and the supplies.

72
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:09,164
They got to be running low.

73
00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:11,199
We got 'em covered.
They can't get away.

74
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,402
Yeah, but how long
we gonna wait?

75
00:04:14,503 --> 00:04:16,470
I want to live
to spend my gold,

76
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:19,540
Even if it takes all the way
'til tomorrow night.

77
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:22,643
Your trouble is you want
to get rich quick.

78
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,413
Look at him.

79
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:26,848
Sleeping.

80
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:29,684
Safe and sound
in his devil's arms.

81
00:04:29,785 --> 00:04:31,753
Do you know how sick
your father is?

82
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,255
How would I know?
I ain't no doctor.

83
00:04:39,394 --> 00:04:42,797
Pa's had this fever
for close to a week now.

84
00:04:42,898 --> 00:04:45,566
It don't mean nothing.
Pa's been poorly for years.

85
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:47,852
You must have found
a very rich strike.

86
00:04:47,953 --> 00:04:50,488
Make him that stubborn,
that excited.

87
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:53,408
That's our mine
and our business.

88
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:56,544
Look, ain't you
figured it out yet?

89
00:04:56,645 --> 00:04:59,247
He's an old fool.
A superstitious old man,

90
00:04:59,348 --> 00:05:01,849
That's chased every rainbow
from sicily to california.

91
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,052
Looking for
his lucky pot of gold.

92
00:05:05,154 --> 00:05:06,887
And I'm a bigger fool.

93
00:05:06,989 --> 00:05:09,591
I've tagged along.

94
00:05:09,691 --> 00:05:11,859
'cause I haven't had
the nerve to leave him.

95
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:15,029
I hate him!

96
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:17,465
I hate him for everything
he is and he ain't.

97
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:20,468
And you're not
very fond of yourself.

98
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:23,438
How long have you been
prospecting for gold?

99
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:25,823
Literally, I mean.

100
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:27,892
Not that long.
Couple of weeks now.

101
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:30,661
We ain't done nothing
for very long.

102
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:35,165
Not even live,
the way things look now.

103
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,070
Where you going?

104
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:42,640
I'm going to take
a look at your mine.

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,469
You two didn't
dig this mine.

106
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:30,705
We found it.
It was abandoned.

107
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:32,674
But it's rich. See?

108
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:34,508
We made a bargain with you.

109
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,528
But only if
we file the claim.

110
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,264
You got any blasting powder?

111
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,199
Yeah.
Get it.

112
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:44,435
Where are your horses?

113
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:46,137
Down there.

114
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:48,539
Tether them as far from
the mine as possible.

115
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,074
What for?

116
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:53,795
You want to file
this claim or not?

117
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:56,514
Then you do exactly
what I tell you.

118
00:07:30,448 --> 00:07:32,183
Here.

119
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:34,585
What are you going to do?

120
00:07:55,023 --> 00:07:56,691
What are you doing?

121
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:59,594
I'm blowing in your mine.
Pa, don't let him!

122
00:07:59,695 --> 00:08:01,529
All right, you want
your mine looted

123
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,582
While we're in town to file
the claim, I won't blow it in.

124
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:06,584
We do what he says.

125
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:08,986
Everything he says.
Sure!

126
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:12,356
<i>Just how are we supposed
to get out of here, vanish?</i>

127
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:14,458
<i>maybe.</i>

128
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:22,350
There's a narrow crevice
behind those rocks.

129
00:08:22,451 --> 00:08:24,452
Leads to the other side.
Your horses can't make it.

130
00:08:24,553 --> 00:08:26,554
We'll have to leave them.
No horses!

131
00:08:26,655 --> 00:08:28,923
Pa's in no condition
to go on foot.

132
00:08:29,024 --> 00:08:31,625
My horse is on
the other side.

133
00:08:31,726 --> 00:08:33,427
Now let's get started.

134
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:36,463
They may change their mind
about waiting you out.

135
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:38,332
We ought to dig
some of that gold first.

136
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:40,501
You got a lot of money
in this sack.

137
00:08:40,602 --> 00:08:42,336
You got at least $2,000.

138
00:08:42,437 --> 00:08:44,171
If you wait to dig some,

139
00:08:44,272 --> 00:08:47,141
They may figure out you
never filed on this claim.

140
00:08:47,242 --> 00:08:49,243
You've got 30 hot miles
to that county seat.

141
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:51,128
If they figure it out,

142
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:52,880
They might just
jump on their horses

143
00:08:52,981 --> 00:08:54,966
And beat you to town.
Maybe.

144
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:57,802
All right.
We're finished waiting.

145
00:08:57,903 --> 00:08:59,603
You may be right.

146
00:08:59,704 --> 00:09:01,672
Now spread out.

147
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:05,742
What do you get
out of all this?

148
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:09,746
If you recall, I mentioned
that I have my price.

149
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:14,885
Come on, old man.

150
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,757
In here.
Down, down!

151
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:25,762
Come on!

152
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:47,784
Come on.

153
00:10:08,457 --> 00:10:10,491
I think we better
rest awhile.

154
00:10:10,592 --> 00:10:12,193
No, I'm all right.

155
00:10:12,294 --> 00:10:14,978
We've got to go
faster than this.

156
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,847
Don't worry about me.

157
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:19,250
They'll catch up with us
for sure at this pace.

158
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:20,951
Pa's right.

159
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:22,219
Maybe.

160
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,388
It's always touching
to see a son respect

161
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:26,324
His father's wishes.

162
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,892
We got to get to
some water somewhere, soon.

163
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:30,812
The next time you go
prospecting for gold,

164
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:32,880
Try an island in
the middle of a lake.

165
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:34,782
We found gold.

166
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:36,483
We found gold!

167
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:38,719
That's good, old man.

168
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,655
Now find water.

169
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:43,758
Come on.

170
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:03,878
Hold up, hold up!

171
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,549
If we even put up a stake,
they couldn't file a claim.

172
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,417
I should have known it.

173
00:11:10,518 --> 00:11:12,452
They can't beat us into town,
that's for certain.

174
00:11:12,554 --> 00:11:14,155
We got their horses.

175
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:16,390
Rudy, you're sure
there were three?

176
00:11:16,491 --> 00:11:18,141
So help me, dirks!

177
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:19,727
Well, there's maybe one horse.

178
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:21,829
Yeah, but probably
not much water.

179
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,898
Good, good.
Blow a man up, will they?

180
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:27,134
I'll set 'em out to fry,
if we catch 'em!

181
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:29,704
We ain't interested
in entertainment.

182
00:11:29,804 --> 00:11:31,772
I'm worried they'll
dump that gold.

183
00:11:31,873 --> 00:11:34,542
It oughta be getting
real heavy about now.

184
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:36,977
That sun beating
down on 'em.

185
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:40,414
Not that old man.
He'll hang onto that gold,

186
00:11:40,598 --> 00:11:43,367
Even if he has
to die for it.

187
00:11:43,468 --> 00:11:45,936
And he will.

188
00:12:11,746 --> 00:12:13,947
Oh, don't bother!

189
00:12:14,048 --> 00:12:16,083
It's dry.

190
00:12:16,184 --> 00:12:19,320
That's a very
astute observation.

191
00:12:33,468 --> 00:12:38,172
That's right.
You sleep, old man.

192
00:12:38,273 --> 00:12:39,640
Sleep.

193
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:46,480
It's getting damp.

194
00:12:46,581 --> 00:12:49,149
Water!
Don't drink it.

195
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,552
it's alkaline.

196
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:53,387
Told you not to bother.

197
00:12:53,488 --> 00:12:55,189
It's got to seep through
two feet of alkaline.

198
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,191
You're surprised
you can't drink it?

199
00:12:57,292 --> 00:12:59,259
What are you doing?

200
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,429
Your father can't stand
another day without water.

201
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,597
So here's where
we make our stand.

202
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,832
There's no water here.

203
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:06,634
There will be,
I promise you.

204
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:09,337
When? How?
Four men will bring it.

205
00:13:09,438 --> 00:13:11,572
Do we have to have a fire?

206
00:13:11,673 --> 00:13:13,941
That smoke'll show
for miles around.

207
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:16,644
You can't ambush
somebody who isn't here.

208
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:18,779
They might miss us.
Are you crazy?

209
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,449
Nobody's going to be stupid
enough to come into those trees.

210
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,218
They'll know it's an ambush. Not in here.

211
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:26,186
We'll leave your father here
out of harm's way.

212
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:27,988
You and I'll be out there.

213
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:31,625
Now get me about four
good-sized tumbleweeds.

214
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,327
And incidentally,

215
00:13:33,428 --> 00:13:35,563
Thank you for
finding this mud.

216
00:13:35,664 --> 00:13:37,365
We're going to need it.

217
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:40,634
There's no cover out there.
Now what are you doing?

218
00:13:43,805 --> 00:13:45,939
"let each soldier
hew down a bough,

219
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,374
"and bear it before him.

220
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:49,693
"and thereby burnham wood
will come to dunsinane."

221
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:50,995
What's that?

222
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:54,798
That, friend,
is shakespeare.

223
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,434
there they are.

224
00:14:14,536 --> 00:14:16,103
I only see two.

225
00:14:16,204 --> 00:14:17,972
You see?
They got another horse.

226
00:14:18,073 --> 00:14:20,340
I told you there
were three of them.

227
00:14:23,745 --> 00:14:26,080
Hey, look.
They're gone.

228
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:30,084
Yeah, tricky.
Keep an eye on 'em.

229
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:32,119
This time we'll
do things my way.

230
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,689
What if they try
and run out again?

231
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,391
On foot? Ha!
I'd like that.

232
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:40,244
You just keep an eye
on that horse, loy.

233
00:14:40,345 --> 00:14:44,064
Without it,
nobody's going nowhere.

234
00:14:50,638 --> 00:14:53,106
Dirks!
Huh?

235
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:55,642
Thought I saw something
moving out there.

236
00:14:55,744 --> 00:14:57,378
Where?

237
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:14,095
There ain't
nothing there now.

238
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:16,947
Maybe I just been
jumping at shadows.

239
00:15:17,015 --> 00:15:18,983
Prairie dogs or something.

240
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,934
Maybe.

241
00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:23,103
They got to try something.

242
00:15:23,204 --> 00:15:26,240
Giving up don't seem
to come natural to 'em.

243
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:03,760
We'll use the wagon
for cover if we have to.

244
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:06,664
Keep your eyes open.
Let's go.

245
00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:12,903
Ahh!

246
00:16:26,784 --> 00:16:31,555
<i>Gino! Gino!</i>

247
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:33,090
<i>Gino!</i>

248
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:35,025
<i>Gino!</i>

249
00:16:38,062 --> 00:16:40,063
Come on, boy!
Come on!

250
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,987
Gino!

251
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:23,691
Gino!

252
00:17:26,227 --> 00:17:29,630
This wound's not serious,
but he's burning with fever.

253
00:17:29,731 --> 00:17:33,000
The gold is gone.
He got away with the gold.

254
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:35,335
Help me get your father
into this wagon.

255
00:17:37,138 --> 00:17:39,506
What...What are you...

256
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:41,875
What are you doing?

257
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,543
What are you doing?!

258
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,013
I'm living up to my part
of the bargain.

259
00:17:46,114 --> 00:17:48,248
No! I won't do it.

260
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:49,850
I won't do it!

261
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:52,920
Take mine.
You can't have gino's.

262
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:54,454
Only mine!

263
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:56,973
I had no right...
Take it.

264
00:17:59,143 --> 00:18:00,644
What's he babbling about?

265
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:03,080
He's trying to renege
on the bargain.

266
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:05,382
He wants to trade his soul
and leave yours out of it.

267
00:18:05,483 --> 00:18:07,418
That's nonsense!
You know it is.

268
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,320
Isn't it?

269
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:37,214
Can't you take it
a little slower?

270
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:39,683
You're hurting
the old buzzard!

271
00:18:39,784 --> 00:18:41,819
We'll never catch up that way.

272
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,854
We got to get him
to a doctor fast,

273
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:46,957
And stop that man from
filing on your claim. Ha!

274
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,195
Ain't there anything
we can do for the old man?

275
00:18:52,296 --> 00:18:54,464
You can pray if
you believe in it.

276
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,846
They're through with him?

277
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:12,315
Yeah. When I find the other
one, I'll send him to you.

278
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,753
According to
the assay office,

279
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,889
That fellow dirks filed a claim
on your mine an hour ago.

280
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,891
I want to find him while
he's still celebrating.

281
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:22,926
Will you go to
the doctor's office,

282
00:19:23,027 --> 00:19:25,379
And take care of your father? Yeah.

283
00:19:54,675 --> 00:19:58,112
Is that mirror
baroque or louis couture?

284
00:19:58,213 --> 00:19:59,480
Huh?

285
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:03,283
How silly of me.
Baroque, of course.

286
00:20:03,384 --> 00:20:05,619
Gentlemen, I might buy.

287
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:10,491
My round's next.
You hit it lucky too?

288
00:20:10,592 --> 00:20:12,426
I'm not sure yet.

289
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:15,129
Bartender, bottled please.

290
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,297
Bottle's a dollar
a shot here.

291
00:20:17,398 --> 00:20:19,032
I'll accept that.

292
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,135
We'll have another round
after this.

293
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:23,103
You owe for four already.

294
00:20:23,204 --> 00:20:25,205
All right, all right!

295
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:27,907
Yours a rich strike?

296
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:34,848
I hear you beat three men
to town to file on this.

297
00:20:34,949 --> 00:20:38,352
Two or three.
What's it to you?

298
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:40,120
I'm the third.

299
00:20:42,857 --> 00:20:44,924
Here.

300
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:47,494
<i>Take a look at your strike.</i>

301
00:20:47,595 --> 00:20:50,697
Take a good look
at your rich strike.

302
00:20:55,303 --> 00:20:57,103
From my mine!

303
00:21:02,977 --> 00:21:06,946
" tis more blessed
to give than receive. "

304
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:09,149
Now you just sign this.

305
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,651
I can't write.

306
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:13,520
Those two gentlemen will be
very happy to witness your mark.

307
00:21:13,621 --> 00:21:16,156
He still owes for eight
drinks. Drinks are on me,

308
00:21:16,257 --> 00:21:18,525
And a bottle apiece
for the witnesses.

309
00:21:18,626 --> 00:21:21,795
Just sign it! You're not
giving anything away.

310
00:21:23,464 --> 00:21:25,031
Thank you very much.

311
00:21:25,132 --> 00:21:27,867
Mr. Dirks, that was
a very kind thing you did,

312
00:21:27,968 --> 00:21:30,237
Shooting that old man.

313
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:38,712
Bartender, you'll find
the sheriff is looking for him.

314
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,215
Let me see that bottle.

315
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,374
Well, there it is.

316
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:08,809
Gentlemen.

317
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,011
You ruined our mine.
It's not exactly your mine.

318
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:12,979
I had the deed
signed over in my name.

319
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,882
Why, you're a crook!

320
00:22:14,982 --> 00:22:16,917
You swindled us.

321
00:22:17,018 --> 00:22:19,753
You were right, gino.
He ain't no devil.

322
00:22:19,854 --> 00:22:22,523
Of all the dirty,
human things to do.

323
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:24,525
Now I haven't
forgotten our bargain.

324
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:26,727
I'll sign the deed
over to you gladly.

325
00:22:26,828 --> 00:22:28,796
But for my price.

326
00:22:30,748 --> 00:22:34,367
I'll take that
small bag of gold.

327
00:22:34,468 --> 00:22:36,770
That's all you want?

328
00:22:45,346 --> 00:22:48,548
Sulfur gas.
Any spark will set it off.

329
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:51,884
Gold ore is often forced to
the surface by sulfur gas.

330
00:22:51,986 --> 00:22:53,753
That smell of brimstone.

331
00:22:53,854 --> 00:22:56,756
That could make you rich.

332
00:23:09,804 --> 00:23:12,772
Now the last man
I showed this to...

333
00:23:12,873 --> 00:23:14,641
He tried to draw on me.

334
00:23:14,742 --> 00:23:16,910
And maybe you'll
want to also.

335
00:23:18,712 --> 00:23:21,381
See, there's no gold
in that mine.

336
00:23:21,482 --> 00:23:23,917
Why, you're a liar!
It's rich.

337
00:23:24,018 --> 00:23:26,153
There is gold
right at the surface.

338
00:23:26,254 --> 00:23:28,688
You found a salted mine.

339
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:32,192
The gold in these pieces
has been cut or milled.

340
00:23:32,293 --> 00:23:34,194
That mine isn't even
rigged for real digging.

341
00:23:34,295 --> 00:23:36,263
And if you weren't
so gold hungry,

342
00:23:36,364 --> 00:23:38,214
You'd have felt it
the most obvious thing.

343
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:42,285
Who ever abandons
a mine full of gold?

344
00:23:42,386 --> 00:23:44,921
You cheated us.
You said we'd be rich.

345
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:46,423
And you will.

346
00:23:46,524 --> 00:23:49,426
The assay office and I
are pleased to inform you

347
00:23:49,527 --> 00:23:52,663
That you are the owners of
a very rich sulfur mine.

348
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,532
Sulfur! There's a lot of money in sulfur.

349
00:23:55,633 --> 00:23:57,935
And a lot of work.
I'd say that mine,

350
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:00,804
In five years,
will pay off very handsomely.

351
00:24:00,905 --> 00:24:03,607
Five years!

352
00:24:13,517 --> 00:24:15,986
Of course, you could
go back to chasing your luck.

353
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,755
Forget all about the sulfur.
That's your affair.

354
00:24:18,856 --> 00:24:21,458
As for me...
This has been

355
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:25,161
A very interesting
and profitable few days.

356
00:24:25,262 --> 00:24:28,599
And I thank you
very much indeed.

357
00:24:35,189 --> 00:24:41,545
 have gun, will travel
reads the card of a man 

358
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:48,184
 a knight without armor
in a savage land 

359
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:54,524
 his fast gun for hire
heeds the calling wind 

360
00:24:54,625 --> 00:25:00,163
 a soldier of fortune
is the man called 

361
00:25:00,264 --> 00:25:04,868
 paladin 

362
00:25:04,969 --> 00:25:11,108
 paladin, paladin,
where do you roam?
