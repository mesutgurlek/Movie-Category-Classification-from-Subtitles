1
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,401
Your land runs a thousand rods
to the left of that big tree...

2
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,403
then it follows the creek.

3
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,405
You keep this paper good.

4
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:28,033
You want to stay with us a spell?

5
00:04:28,109 --> 00:04:30,134
Sure be obliged.

6
00:04:30,845 --> 00:04:32,278
Thank you.

7
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,558
Good luck.

8
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:04,190
Listen to me, you hear?

9
00:08:04,258 --> 00:08:07,557
You people from Louisiana,
ain't ya?

10
00:08:07,628 --> 00:08:10,324
There's plenty of good work for ya
back there...

11
00:08:10,398 --> 00:08:12,332
choppin' cotton, cuttin' cane.

12
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,267
Good jobs with people who know you.

13
00:08:15,336 --> 00:08:17,429
You was born there.
You was raised there.

14
00:08:17,505 --> 00:08:21,874
You don't belong out here.
You couldn't last the winter.

15
00:08:21,942 --> 00:08:24,342
You ain't got no place to live.

16
00:08:24,412 --> 00:08:27,040
No farm tools, no sheep.

17
00:08:27,114 --> 00:08:31,175
So you're gonna turn around
and go home.

18
00:08:32,353 --> 00:08:33,615
Hey, you.

19
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:36,613
Come here.

20
00:08:44,765 --> 00:08:46,198
Where's Buck?

21
00:08:47,968 --> 00:08:51,529
I'm looking for your wagonmaster
name of Buck.

22
00:08:53,507 --> 00:08:54,940
No Buck here.

23
00:08:57,711 --> 00:08:59,645
Don't know nobody named Buck.

24
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:02,648
He's the one that brought you here.

25
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:06,880
So where'd he go? Where'd you hire him,
and where's he stayin'?

26
00:09:06,954 --> 00:09:09,115
He had a name something else.

27
00:09:10,491 --> 00:09:11,924
Ain't no Buck!

28
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,890
Where is Buck?

29
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,335
He's near here, Floyd.

30
00:11:13,113 --> 00:11:16,549
You're gonna go outside,
wave to your old man.

31
00:11:16,617 --> 00:11:21,077
If you holler, I'll kill
everything around here that moves.

32
00:11:21,155 --> 00:11:22,588
Everything.

33
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:32,375
Get them horses! Floyd!

34
00:14:34,314 --> 00:14:35,747
Get goin'!

35
00:17:34,962 --> 00:17:36,395
Howdy do!

36
00:17:41,668 --> 00:17:44,159
- I need a horse.
- I can see that.

37
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:46,330
I'll pay you $20.

38
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:48,340
That's a handsome price.

39
00:17:50,711 --> 00:17:53,305
But I ain't in
the horse-trading business, brother.

40
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,610
I got to travel fast.

41
00:17:55,682 --> 00:17:59,482
I sure do wish I could be
of service to you, but...

42
00:17:59,553 --> 00:18:03,080
- I don't want to have to take him.
- Who says you have to?

43
00:18:04,157 --> 00:18:05,590
Hold it.

44
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,487
Any objection if I get into my drawers?
Or do you need them, too?

45
00:18:35,922 --> 00:18:38,152
Just gettin' my boots, brother.

46
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:58,773
- You're eatin' my rabbit.
- What you doin' out here?

47
00:19:00,213 --> 00:19:02,147
Gettin' into my drawers.

48
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,509
- You gonna take my horse!
- Drop your drawers.

49
00:19:37,584 --> 00:19:39,381
- Wait a minute!
- Drop them!

50
00:19:42,189 --> 00:19:43,679
Damn!

51
00:19:58,271 --> 00:20:00,637
You forgot your coffee!

52
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:43,610
There's two mountains
pointin' up to the sky.

53
00:20:43,683 --> 00:20:47,744
Beyond that there's a valley,
green...

54
00:20:47,821 --> 00:20:49,914
with cool water.

55
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,117
I can see it's there.

56
00:20:52,192 --> 00:20:53,625
Called Colorado.

57
00:20:55,228 --> 00:20:57,321
But don't turn back.

58
00:20:57,397 --> 00:21:00,366
That valley is going to be our home.

59
00:21:09,843 --> 00:21:11,777
We're going on.

60
00:21:21,288 --> 00:21:22,721
All right.

61
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:27,419
Night riders hit Pappy Whitlock
and his people here two weeks ago.

62
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,952
3 days later they burned a wagon train
supposed to meet me at Sulphur Flats.

63
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:32,965
About here.

64
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:35,593
Then they got
the Deep Smith County people...

65
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,637
at the water hole
this side of Clayton.

66
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:42,833
They're headin' this way.
You got to move out tonight.

67
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,056
Mornin', sir.

68
00:23:08,128 --> 00:23:10,392
Could you get me a bottle
of whiskey out here?

69
00:23:10,463 --> 00:23:12,556
You could go inside.

70
00:23:12,632 --> 00:23:17,092
My man, good liquor is best enjoyed
in the open firmament.

71
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:23,899
Anyways, my heart yearneth for the dusky
company of my own emancipated people.

72
00:23:25,512 --> 00:23:27,912
Where are the colored folks
around here, son? Where do you live?

73
00:23:27,981 --> 00:23:31,712
My mammy and the rest
at Mr. Logan's place ten miles out.

74
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:35,721
- Do all the colored live there?
- No, sir. We just passin' through.

75
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,690
We made a crop for Mr. Logan.

76
00:23:38,758 --> 00:23:40,350
Boy!

77
00:23:41,661 --> 00:23:42,889
The whiskey.

78
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,363
Forty cents a bottle,
cash money.

79
00:23:52,939 --> 00:23:54,372
Oh, yeah.

80
00:26:08,842 --> 00:26:12,039
Where'd you get that horse?

81
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,376
That animal was delivered to me
in the wilderness.

82
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,711
Where's the man who rode that horse?

83
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:20,048
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

84
00:26:21,087 --> 00:26:23,487
A man cometh
and a man goeth.

85
00:26:23,556 --> 00:26:26,047
In this trackless wilderness,
who shall know but the Lord?

86
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,889
Don't play with me.

87
00:26:29,362 --> 00:26:32,388
There's nobody back there,
Uncle Beau.

88
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,932
Where's Buck?

89
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,594
- Is his name Buck?
- Where is he?

90
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,743
I'm lookin' for that miserable...

91
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:48,212
no good, lowdown sinner myself.

92
00:26:48,281 --> 00:26:50,977
When I find him, I'll smite him
hip and thigh.

93
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:55,111
- How come you got his horse?
- On account he stole mine.

94
00:26:55,188 --> 00:26:57,122
And left me out there to perish.

95
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,784
He's lyin'.

96
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:02,259
As God is my judge!
I swear on this Bible!

97
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:04,990
What you doin' out here?

98
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:09,660
Just wanderin' as the Lord wills,
spreadin' the word of the gospel.

99
00:27:09,736 --> 00:27:12,330
I'm doin' like you gentlemen.
I'm just fightin' sin.

100
00:27:12,405 --> 00:27:13,667
Hear me.

101
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,608
We want this Buck.
We want him bad.

102
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:22,080
You see him,
you tell us where he is...

103
00:27:23,283 --> 00:27:26,741
there's $500 for you.

104
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:28,480
You remember that?

105
00:27:28,555 --> 00:27:31,752
Five hundred dollars.

106
00:27:31,824 --> 00:27:33,758
That's easy to remember.

107
00:27:35,295 --> 00:27:38,924
I don't suppose for that kind of money
you particular whether he dead or alive.

108
00:27:38,998 --> 00:27:40,488
Either.

109
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:44,560
And if in my search for this sinner,
I finds him...

110
00:27:44,637 --> 00:27:47,162
where do I finds you gentlemen?

111
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,869
Copper Springs.
Ask for Deshay.

112
00:27:50,944 --> 00:27:52,502
Mr. Deshay.

113
00:27:55,315 --> 00:28:00,309
So you a wanderin' preacher
ministering to your people out here?

114
00:28:00,386 --> 00:28:02,377
Yes, sir.

115
00:28:02,455 --> 00:28:06,084
Though they's few and far between,
the need for salvation is everywhere.

116
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,184
Best thing you can tell 'em.

117
00:28:08,261 --> 00:28:12,322
Turn around.
Go back home.

118
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:15,629
"Turn around and go back home."

119
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,824
Young man!

120
00:28:56,376 --> 00:28:59,004
- Pleasant afternoon.
- Yes, sir.

121
00:28:59,078 --> 00:29:01,012
You walk home every day?

122
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,480
No, sir.
I sleeps under the bar.

123
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:05,642
But they finished with the crop
for Mr. Logan...

124
00:29:05,718 --> 00:29:08,084
and they goin' to have
roast pig and chicken.

125
00:29:08,154 --> 00:29:10,418
That a fact?
Who's your preacher?

126
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,287
We ain't got none.

127
00:29:12,358 --> 00:29:14,292
Then who gives thanks to the Lord?

128
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,693
Old Uncle Cudjo.
He's more conjurer than preacher.

129
00:29:17,764 --> 00:29:19,698
That a fact?

130
00:29:19,766 --> 00:29:23,167
May I prevail upon you
to share my beast of burden?

131
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,603
The horse, son.

132
00:29:48,194 --> 00:29:50,253
Who's that with Toby?

133
00:30:11,317 --> 00:30:12,807
Blessings in His name.

134
00:30:12,885 --> 00:30:14,944
I'm the Reverend
Willis Oakes Rutherford...

135
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:18,013
of the high and low order
of the Holiness Persuasion Church.

136
00:30:18,091 --> 00:30:21,857
- Where you from, Reverend?
- Sunflower County, Mississippi, mostly.

137
00:30:21,928 --> 00:30:23,361
Where you headin'?

138
00:30:24,497 --> 00:30:26,988
In the vastness of God's green earth,
there is no corner...

139
00:30:27,066 --> 00:30:29,034
that does not challenge my ministry.

140
00:30:29,102 --> 00:30:31,730
I'm headed there,
and I could be there tomorrow.

141
00:30:31,804 --> 00:30:34,637
Where you from, brother?

142
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:37,801
We all from St. Anne Parish,
Louisiana.

143
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:40,638
My name is Kingston.

144
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:44,114
Pleased to meet you, Brother Kingston.
Well, well.

145
00:30:44,183 --> 00:30:46,447
- Sister.
- Reverend.

146
00:30:47,487 --> 00:30:51,184
- You've come a long way.
- And we goin' further yet.

147
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:56,025
I do admire to meet
a good Christian congregation.

148
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:00,691
Yes.

149
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:04,066
And if you'll permit me...

150
00:31:04,137 --> 00:31:06,071
after a bit of supper...

151
00:31:07,006 --> 00:31:11,033
I would like to offer a prayer
for your safe guidance here...

152
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:14,204
beneath the wonders
of God's creation.

153
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,723
How'd you find me?

154
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,782
I asked your horse.

155
00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:05,463
It's all right.
It ain't nothin'

156
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,833
- What's on your mind?
- My horse, amongst other things.

157
00:32:12,905 --> 00:32:16,068
You get your horse.
What are you doin' 'round here?

158
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,633
Spreading the sweet word
of the gospel.

159
00:32:20,046 --> 00:32:22,037
You a preacher?

160
00:32:22,114 --> 00:32:24,105
The Reverend Willis Oakes Rutherford...

161
00:32:24,183 --> 00:32:27,914
of the high and low order
of the Holiness Persuasion Church.

162
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,119
You can take supper here.
That'll square for the rabbit.

163
00:32:34,193 --> 00:32:37,094
You can rest a while,
and then you move on.

164
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,596
Buck.

165
00:32:45,671 --> 00:32:49,903
Fifty, 60, 70, 80, 90.

166
00:32:49,976 --> 00:32:52,945
Four hundred, 410, 420.

167
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,412
Four mules,
a litter of pigs.

168
00:32:55,481 --> 00:32:58,109
Right on the barrelhead,
fair and square.

169
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,446
That's right.

170
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:07,121
If you folks want to stay and plant
another crop, we'll make the same deal.

171
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:10,026
No. We better be movin' on.

172
00:33:10,096 --> 00:33:12,428
But much obliged to you anyway, sir.

173
00:33:12,498 --> 00:33:13,931
All right.

174
00:35:11,951 --> 00:35:13,976
Which way you ridin',
Preacher?

175
00:35:14,053 --> 00:35:16,749
I've not exactly
settled my mind yet.

176
00:35:16,822 --> 00:35:20,724
You've got three possibilities:
North, south or east.

177
00:35:20,793 --> 00:35:22,727
- What happened to west?
- We goin' west.

178
00:35:22,795 --> 00:35:26,731
There's a lot of room out in the West.
It's not elbow to elbow out that way.

179
00:35:26,799 --> 00:35:29,893
You got your horse.
Don't press your luck.

180
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:32,335
Tell me something, Buck.
What you got against me?

181
00:35:32,405 --> 00:35:36,398
Nothin'. 'Cept it's a fool farmer let
the weasel travel in the chicken coop.

182
00:35:36,475 --> 00:35:38,636
I know an Eastman when I see one.

183
00:35:38,711 --> 00:35:41,612
These people ain't for pickin'.

184
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,809
I told you I ain't no Eastman.
I'm a preacher.

185
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:05,702
On the other hand, you could say it's
a might stuffy out there to the west.

186
00:36:08,441 --> 00:36:10,375
Amen, brother.

187
00:36:12,244 --> 00:36:14,178
Fivefold, amen.

188
00:36:51,283 --> 00:36:53,911
- You double your watch tonight, hear?
- I'll do that.

189
00:36:53,986 --> 00:36:55,954
I'll be back tomorrow
by sundown at the latest.

190
00:36:56,021 --> 00:36:59,149
- You can find water holes on the map?
- Yeah, they're plain.

191
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,931
Indians!

192
00:38:23,008 --> 00:38:25,306
Buck, Indians!

193
00:38:30,716 --> 00:38:33,207
- What are you doing?
- Get off your horse.

194
00:38:33,285 --> 00:38:36,220
- Have you looked behind you recent?
- Get down!

195
00:38:46,398 --> 00:38:48,332
Don't tell me you done took
to prayin'.

196
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,063
Preacher, you do as I say.
Hunker down and keep your mouth shut.

197
00:39:25,471 --> 00:39:27,029
Sweet Jesus.

198
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,278
Lord of mercy, look at that.

199
00:39:35,347 --> 00:39:38,282
If you don't be quiet,
you're gonna be dead.

200
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,650
- Do you have good health?
- Yes.

201
00:39:43,722 --> 00:39:46,213
- Things go well?
- Some things, some days.

202
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,527
What do you want, Sergeant?

203
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,859
I got a wagon train comin' through.

204
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:57,200
Forty head of people,
not including children.

205
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,430
- What kind of people?
- Black.

206
00:39:59,505 --> 00:40:01,439
I want them to get through safe
to the pass...

207
00:40:01,507 --> 00:40:04,601
north of the salt wales
on the west bank of the Pecos.

208
00:40:25,864 --> 00:40:27,798
You have five days to pass.

209
00:40:27,866 --> 00:40:31,233
That's pressing. They've got
sorry horses and worn-out mules.

210
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,066
Five days.

211
00:40:34,873 --> 00:40:36,238
All right.

212
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:38,674
Ten dollars each one.

213
00:40:38,744 --> 00:40:40,678
I was thinking on $6.

214
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,081
Eight.

215
00:40:45,584 --> 00:40:48,382
They've gotta live through the winter,
and they got children.

216
00:40:48,454 --> 00:40:50,445
Tell him children ain't worth eight.

217
00:40:57,463 --> 00:40:58,930
Eight. Children nothing.

218
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:02,934
They gonna need food. I can get by
if I kill three buffalo.

219
00:41:13,412 --> 00:41:15,346
One buffalo.

220
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:44,104
My husband say two buffalo
if you must.

221
00:41:45,344 --> 00:41:46,777
Thank you.

222
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,010
Brother, you're a man of many parts.

223
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,017
How do you know how to dicker
with Indians?

224
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,848
Why were you trackin' me?

225
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,913
Me? Fact is, I got lost.

226
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:36,950
I praise God I found your tracks or I
might've perished here like a heathen.

227
00:44:04,383 --> 00:44:05,816
Toby?

228
00:46:25,557 --> 00:46:27,457
My God!

229
00:46:51,383 --> 00:46:53,317
Okay. It's all right now.

230
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,289
Get me some water.

231
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:16,966
The money's gone.
All $1400.

232
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:20,375
How we gonna live through the winter?
Where we gonna get food and seed?

233
00:47:20,445 --> 00:47:23,380
Ain't no use.
We done been turned around.

234
00:47:25,417 --> 00:47:27,510
Penny. Suzanna.

235
00:47:27,586 --> 00:47:28,917
Tom DeCooper.

236
00:47:28,987 --> 00:47:30,420
Joseph.

237
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,018
Rachel and Toby.

238
00:47:34,092 --> 00:47:35,525
All dead.

239
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:40,922
But the valley is there.

240
00:47:40,999 --> 00:47:43,365
Green and wild.

241
00:47:45,937 --> 00:47:47,370
It's there.

242
00:47:57,949 --> 00:47:59,541
We gonna go on.

243
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,414
You ain't got no supplies, no food.

244
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:07,424
You can't make it
through the winter.

245
00:48:08,627 --> 00:48:11,562
Then we dies in the snow.

246
00:48:16,701 --> 00:48:19,636
No, you ain't gonna die in the snow.

247
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,437
- The old man said we're goin' on?
- Yeah.

248
00:48:26,511 --> 00:48:28,172
Then we're goin'.

249
00:48:28,246 --> 00:48:31,374
But you know we ain't got the money
to pay what we owe you.

250
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,883
Don't matter.

251
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:34,885
You paid for safe passage
through the Indian land.

252
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:37,513
You'll cross north of the salt wales.

253
00:48:37,589 --> 00:48:39,523
You only got five days to pass.

254
00:48:39,591 --> 00:48:43,254
I'll find you somewhere
north of the Pecos.

255
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:51,561
Ain't nothin' left here for you,
Eastman.

256
00:48:51,636 --> 00:48:55,072
You can come or go.
It don't matter.

257
00:49:06,518 --> 00:49:10,113
You ever hear of Copper Springs?
Ten riders, boss named Deshay.

258
00:49:10,188 --> 00:49:11,621
How you know?

259
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:15,057
They catched me with your horse
in a stop called Frenchman's Ford.

260
00:49:15,126 --> 00:49:17,856
They asked a lot of mean questions.
Now I know why.

261
00:49:17,929 --> 00:49:19,794
Copper Springs?

262
00:49:19,865 --> 00:49:21,799
I heard 'em say
they holes up there.

263
00:49:21,867 --> 00:49:24,597
And I remember
every one of them faces.

264
00:50:06,978 --> 00:50:10,414
- Deshay, hold up a minute.
- Ollie, how are things?

265
00:50:10,482 --> 00:50:11,915
I wanna talk to you.

266
00:50:11,983 --> 00:50:13,575
Delighted.

267
00:50:13,652 --> 00:50:15,586
Floyd, get me a bourbon.

268
00:50:17,289 --> 00:50:20,019
You ran into a couple of wagon trains
out yonder.

269
00:50:21,126 --> 00:50:23,356
We just had a little talk
is all.

270
00:50:23,428 --> 00:50:25,362
You listen to me, Deshay.

271
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:28,228
Nobody's gonna be gunned downed,
whipped or burned out in this town...

272
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,666
as long as I have a say so.

273
00:50:30,735 --> 00:50:33,670
That goes for the coloreds
as well as anyone else.

274
00:50:33,738 --> 00:50:37,834
Ollie, I just rode in to pick up my mail
and spend a little time at Esther's.

275
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:40,275
Never mind. I'm tellin' ya.

276
00:50:40,345 --> 00:50:42,870
Those folks can come and go
as they like. That's the law.

277
00:50:44,049 --> 00:50:48,008
Sheriff, you got an official complaint
against me and my boys?

278
00:50:49,788 --> 00:50:52,689
We are bona fide labor recruiters...

279
00:50:52,757 --> 00:50:56,249
employed by the
Delta Planters Association in Louisiana.

280
00:50:56,328 --> 00:51:01,129
There's a whole way of life back there
goin' down the drain.

281
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:03,394
We don't intend to see it
frittered away.

282
00:51:03,468 --> 00:51:07,097
I don't care who you're workin' for.
This ain't Louisiana.

283
00:51:07,172 --> 00:51:09,299
You walk soft in my town.

284
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:16,065
That's them.
Deshay is the one with the hat.

285
00:52:16,141 --> 00:52:18,575
There's only eight of 'em in there.

286
00:52:18,643 --> 00:52:21,544
The other two are in the saloon.

287
00:52:21,613 --> 00:52:24,309
You taking eight of 'em
in one gulp?

288
00:52:24,382 --> 00:52:27,749
Five.
Three of 'em busy upstairs.

289
00:52:27,819 --> 00:52:30,720
They ain't tied down forever.

290
00:52:30,789 --> 00:52:33,053
I just gotta catch 'em off guard.

291
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,751
Let me talk to 'em.

292
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:41,764
You catch 'em off guard.

293
00:52:52,577 --> 00:52:54,408
Blessings on this house!

294
00:52:56,848 --> 00:53:00,841
I am Reverend Willis Oakes Rutherford
of the Holy Persuasion Church.

295
00:53:00,919 --> 00:53:02,318
Get out!

296
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:05,584
You do recollect we've encountered
each other previous.

297
00:53:09,294 --> 00:53:11,694
- It's that old preacher.
- Yes!

298
00:53:11,763 --> 00:53:14,357
I run a selective house.
This ain't a New Orleans crib.

299
00:53:14,432 --> 00:53:15,831
Shut up.

300
00:53:17,168 --> 00:53:18,499
What you want?

301
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:22,301
You do recall there was
a mean old silly...

302
00:53:22,373 --> 00:53:24,898
you was interested in
by the name of Buck.

303
00:53:27,912 --> 00:53:29,846
You know where he is?

304
00:53:29,914 --> 00:53:33,042
They have eyes that see not
until they are open!

305
00:53:33,118 --> 00:53:35,177
Don't trifle with me.

306
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:38,222
I ain't trifling, sir.

307
00:53:38,289 --> 00:53:42,988
But I do seem to remember
that there was a sum mentioned.

308
00:53:43,061 --> 00:53:45,120
$500 to be exact.

309
00:53:45,196 --> 00:53:46,356
Where is he?

310
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:49,764
Yea, though he flees as a shadow,
yet will I lead thee to him...

311
00:53:49,834 --> 00:53:51,563
but for $500.

312
00:53:51,636 --> 00:53:54,230
I ain't gonna bargain with you.

313
00:53:54,305 --> 00:53:58,537
You tell us where he's at,
and maybe we talk money.

314
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:01,135
Get him out!
I've got my reputation.

315
00:54:01,212 --> 00:54:04,773
Thy suffers that woman Jezebel
who calleth herself a prophetess...

316
00:54:04,849 --> 00:54:07,716
to teach and seduce my servants
into fornication.

317
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,981
Revelations, chapter 2.

318
00:54:10,054 --> 00:54:11,954
What is he doing here?

319
00:54:12,023 --> 00:54:13,615
He's preachin'.

320
00:54:13,691 --> 00:54:17,183
That's right, brother, I'm preachin'.
And my text is fornication.

321
00:54:17,262 --> 00:54:21,460
He that committeth fornication sineth
against his own body. Corinthians 1.

322
00:54:21,533 --> 00:54:23,899
That's you, Esther!

323
00:54:23,968 --> 00:54:25,868
"That's you, Esther!"

324
00:54:25,937 --> 00:54:29,395
Fornication!
That's the way to ruination.

325
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:31,601
That's the way
they's taught the nation.

326
00:54:31,676 --> 00:54:32,870
Go, Preacher!

327
00:54:32,944 --> 00:54:36,072
You keep up that fornicatin',
it'll take you to ruination.

328
00:54:39,717 --> 00:54:44,154
This man there he just fornicates.
Yes, sir.

329
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:53,855
He's comin' and he's waitin',
got no time for fornicatin'.

330
00:54:58,269 --> 00:55:00,260
I'm Buck.

331
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:32,332
I put my faith in the Good Book.

332
00:56:47,178 --> 00:56:49,203
Ain't no more than $100 here.

333
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:52,382
I got about $30.

334
00:57:00,725 --> 00:57:04,058
Where's the money?
Where is it?

335
00:57:18,009 --> 00:57:19,806
The money!

336
00:57:21,212 --> 00:57:23,680
I'm talking to you.
Where is it?

337
00:57:23,748 --> 00:57:26,148
Buck, we've got to move!

338
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,990
Come on, Preacher.

339
00:57:40,064 --> 00:57:42,157
Stick to me, Jesus.

340
00:59:11,222 --> 00:59:12,917
Will you hurry up?

341
00:59:25,036 --> 00:59:28,437
Are they gonna track us
through four miles of sheep-dip?

342
00:59:28,506 --> 00:59:32,033
They don't have to. They know where
I've got to go. They've been there.

343
00:59:33,644 --> 00:59:37,637
$157! They drunk up and screwed away
more than $1,000!

344
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:41,284
That's a lot of drinkin'.

345
00:59:43,421 --> 00:59:45,787
And they didn't even have my $500.

346
00:59:46,691 --> 00:59:48,181
What $500?

347
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:52,261
What they was gonna pay me
to deliver you.

348
00:59:56,567 --> 00:59:58,660
Well, I'm here, ain't I?

349
00:59:58,736 --> 01:00:01,136
And they's dead, ain't they?

350
01:00:08,546 --> 01:00:10,673
Yeah.

351
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,736
Jesus!

352
01:01:12,276 --> 01:01:13,709
You all right?

353
01:01:13,778 --> 01:01:16,110
I ran to Aunt Pennybeggers,
and she took me in.

354
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:18,671
- They didn't hurt you none?
- Cuff me on the head, that's all.

355
01:01:18,749 --> 01:01:20,410
That's all.

356
01:01:24,655 --> 01:01:27,351
They hit the Saint Anne Parish people.

357
01:01:27,425 --> 01:01:30,724
They killed some,
and they burned 'em out.

358
01:01:30,795 --> 01:01:33,229
- You better rest.
- I ain't got no time.

359
01:01:33,297 --> 01:01:35,231
I didn't know
if you was alive or dead.

360
01:01:35,299 --> 01:01:37,494
I couldn't come back.
They might've been waitin'.

361
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:39,695
I know, I know.

362
01:01:45,409 --> 01:01:47,502
Horses are in the thicket.

363
01:01:49,947 --> 01:01:52,040
That's Ruth.
Ruth, this is Preacher.

364
01:01:55,853 --> 01:01:58,185
Your servant, ma'am.

365
01:02:00,157 --> 01:02:02,887
Y'all sit down.
I get you something to eat.

366
01:02:19,143 --> 01:02:21,111
Where can we get some horses
around here?

367
01:02:21,178 --> 01:02:23,146
Elias Pennybegger has horses.

368
01:02:23,214 --> 01:02:25,944
We can trust them.
She's my friend.

369
01:02:29,687 --> 01:02:31,484
How many horses?

370
01:02:31,555 --> 01:02:33,580
At least one for you.

371
01:02:34,659 --> 01:02:37,253
You've got to come. They've been
here once, they can come again.

372
01:02:37,328 --> 01:02:41,321
- They still after you?
- Not all of them. Some dead.

373
01:02:41,399 --> 01:02:44,061
Eight to be exact.

374
01:02:45,036 --> 01:02:47,334
We goin' north like we said,
to Canada?

375
01:02:47,405 --> 01:02:52,001
No, we can't.
Not yet.

376
01:02:52,076 --> 01:02:53,771
Why not?

377
01:02:55,413 --> 01:02:57,381
Where we goin'?

378
01:02:57,448 --> 01:03:02,078
You done what you could in this country,
and it all end on fire in a grave.

379
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:04,849
I ain't gonna live in this land no more.
You hear me?

380
01:03:04,922 --> 01:03:10,519
The war ain't changed nothing or nobody.
It's a poison soaked into the ground.

381
01:03:11,562 --> 01:03:15,498
They gonna give us nothing.
Not no 40 acres and no mule.

382
01:03:15,566 --> 01:03:17,625
And not freedom, neither.

383
01:03:17,702 --> 01:03:21,638
It's a poison soaked into the ground.

384
01:03:27,945 --> 01:03:33,042
The time is going. I don't wanna spend
my life washing other people's clothes.

385
01:03:33,117 --> 01:03:36,450
I wanna live somewhere with you, Buck,
like natural people.

386
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,454
I wanna have your children...

387
01:03:38,522 --> 01:03:42,390
and raise them someplace
where there ain't a shadow of slavery.

388
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:48,160
I think about sewing,
making pretty things for my family...

389
01:03:48,232 --> 01:03:50,496
while my hands are still steady.

390
01:03:57,408 --> 01:03:59,603
I wanna go someplace with you, Buck.

391
01:03:59,677 --> 01:04:01,975
I wanna have your children.

392
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:04,139
But I won't have 'em here.

393
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:07,844
I am going somewhere...

394
01:04:10,187 --> 01:04:12,849
They won't have us in Canada...

395
01:04:12,923 --> 01:04:16,654
I'll go to the edge of the ocean
and I'll walks on away from here.

396
01:04:21,432 --> 01:04:24,663
Saint Anne Parish folk...

397
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:32,641
they're heading out there
and they ain't got no food, no seed.

398
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:35,201
And they starve when the winter come.

399
01:04:35,279 --> 01:04:38,510
Buck, honey, you just one man.

400
01:04:38,582 --> 01:04:41,517
But I gave my word.

401
01:04:51,228 --> 01:04:53,560
Eat your food.

402
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:01,536
I'll go see about the horses.

403
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,181
What you studying?

404
01:05:52,423 --> 01:05:54,618
Troubled about all that killing.

405
01:05:58,762 --> 01:06:00,923
I killed men before.

406
01:06:02,266 --> 01:06:05,963
I just don't know which way
to turn no more. I think they beat me.

407
01:06:08,105 --> 01:06:12,098
Couldn't drivers do it in slavery days,
nor the rebels in the war...

408
01:06:12,176 --> 01:06:14,736
but now I think...

409
01:06:14,812 --> 01:06:16,780
they beat me.

410
01:06:19,316 --> 01:06:20,840
You're just tired.

411
01:06:22,219 --> 01:06:27,020
When it's dark, looks like the heart
just gets to hurting sometimes.

412
01:06:28,092 --> 01:06:31,027
You gonna keep on fightin'
best way you can.

413
01:06:31,095 --> 01:06:34,258
Looks like there
just ain't no other way.

414
01:06:35,799 --> 01:06:38,461
I love you, Buck.

415
01:07:09,166 --> 01:07:11,726
Where'd you get them cannons?

416
01:07:13,938 --> 01:07:16,372
Gunsmith in Fort Leavenworth.

417
01:07:17,608 --> 01:07:19,667
Where'd you get that funny Bible?

418
01:07:21,178 --> 01:07:24,045
That my inheritance.

419
01:07:24,114 --> 01:07:26,344
Before the war when I was a boy...

420
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:29,045
my mama and me was sold
to this traveling preacher.

421
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:32,088
I'd fetch for him,
and take up collection.

422
01:07:32,156 --> 01:07:34,716
And when he got drunk,
I'd haul him off to bed.

423
01:07:34,792 --> 01:07:38,319
He traveled in these little towns
preaching sin and hellfire.

424
01:07:38,395 --> 01:07:40,454
And when he got them gals
full of the Holy Spirit...

425
01:07:40,531 --> 01:07:42,692
when they're ready to repent,
he'd jig 'em.

426
01:07:44,301 --> 01:07:46,132
Between while...

427
01:07:46,203 --> 01:07:48,763
he'd take my mama to bed.

428
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:51,069
I'd sleep out with the horse.

429
01:07:52,009 --> 01:07:56,844
By and by, about 16, he sent me
to town for a jug of whiskey.

430
01:07:56,914 --> 01:07:59,109
When I come back, my mama was gone.

431
01:07:59,183 --> 01:08:01,708
He sold her
for a couple hundred dollars.

432
01:08:03,787 --> 01:08:06,483
He got drunk that night,
and he said...

433
01:08:06,557 --> 01:08:09,253
"Boy, put me to bed."

434
01:08:11,328 --> 01:08:15,424
So I lead that man into
the tanning yard by the lime pit.

435
01:08:15,499 --> 01:08:18,059
I put him to bed right there.

436
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:20,831
I hold him under
with a cedar fence rail.

437
01:08:26,543 --> 01:08:28,602
There was no next of kin.

438
01:08:28,679 --> 01:08:31,614
So I got the cart, the horse...

439
01:08:33,183 --> 01:08:36,311
preacher clothes
and this funny Bible.

440
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:41,424
Where are you gonna find that money?

441
01:08:45,029 --> 01:08:47,122
I don't know.

442
01:08:49,266 --> 01:08:53,202
If it was me, I'd look for money
where money's kept.

443
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:56,467
Like in a bank
or an express office.

444
01:08:58,475 --> 01:09:01,171
We gonna walk in the bank
and just take it?

445
01:09:01,245 --> 01:09:03,179
That's right, brother.

446
01:09:04,948 --> 01:09:06,939
And I know just the place...

447
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:11,647
where they ain't got no sheriff,
no deputy, and hardly any menfolk...

448
01:09:11,722 --> 01:09:16,853
'cause they out around the countryside
chasing two poor field hands.

449
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:19,555
You're crazy.

450
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:22,999
Yeah.

451
01:11:04,368 --> 01:11:06,302
What you want, boy?

452
01:11:10,507 --> 01:11:13,169
You make a sound and you're a dead man.

453
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:06,086
We ain't got all day.

454
01:12:14,972 --> 01:12:17,440
What's in the box?

455
01:12:17,507 --> 01:12:20,408
- What's in the box?
- U.S. Government shipment.

456
01:12:22,479 --> 01:12:24,413
Shipment of what?

457
01:12:25,148 --> 01:12:26,240
What?

458
01:12:27,651 --> 01:12:28,913
Gold.

459
01:12:31,455 --> 01:12:32,888
Gold.

460
01:12:34,124 --> 01:12:36,183
Sweet God Almighty, that's gold.

461
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:39,392
Where's the paper money?

462
01:12:39,463 --> 01:12:43,524
There isn't any.
I sent the cash deposit to the bank.

463
01:12:44,935 --> 01:12:46,368
Get off that.

464
01:12:47,404 --> 01:12:51,101
- That's a whole mess of gold.
- You can't carry it on a horse.

465
01:12:52,309 --> 01:12:54,743
Where's the key?
There's got to be a key!

466
01:12:54,811 --> 01:12:57,905
In Texas.
They always send the key separate.

467
01:12:57,981 --> 01:13:01,007
He's telling the truth,
but there's got to be paper money.

468
01:13:01,084 --> 01:13:04,815
I'm gonna ask you for the last time.
Where is that paper money?

469
01:13:05,722 --> 01:13:07,417
I told ya.

470
01:13:07,491 --> 01:13:09,118
At the bank.

471
01:13:09,192 --> 01:13:11,786
I sent it over there.

472
01:13:13,497 --> 01:13:15,465
What do you think?

473
01:13:15,532 --> 01:13:19,992
What the hell? Otherwise
we done wasted the whole morning.

474
01:13:59,609 --> 01:14:01,770
Posse's riding by.
Sheriff's with 'em.

475
01:14:12,255 --> 01:14:14,382
That's it.

476
01:14:14,458 --> 01:14:16,551
Let's get outta here.

477
01:14:20,063 --> 01:14:24,397
- I'm going to that bank.
- It's across from the sheriff's office.

478
01:14:25,702 --> 01:14:27,727
There's a lot of money there.

479
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:31,803
Otherwise we done wasted
the whole morning.

480
01:14:31,875 --> 01:14:33,843
You're the one that's crazy.

481
01:16:54,751 --> 01:16:58,118
- Mornin', Miss Esther. How you feelin'?
- Better, thanks.

482
01:16:59,289 --> 01:17:03,055
Thing like that's not easy to forget,
but life goes on.

483
01:17:03,126 --> 01:17:05,720
- My money good enough for your bank?
- Money's money.

484
01:17:05,795 --> 01:17:07,888
Hard earned, too.

485
01:17:07,964 --> 01:17:10,865
Wages of sin.
Just so as I get three percent of 'em.

486
01:17:12,636 --> 01:17:15,366
Someone stuck me with Ohio banknotes.
Are they any good?

487
01:17:15,438 --> 01:17:18,498
That depends on the solvency
of that particular bank.

488
01:21:23,953 --> 01:21:25,944
They're gonna get away!

489
01:21:26,022 --> 01:21:27,455
Yeah.

490
01:21:29,559 --> 01:21:32,426
You shoot that rifle, boy,
and we're dead!

491
01:21:32,495 --> 01:21:35,259
You gonna quit?

492
01:21:36,166 --> 01:21:38,100
Remember that wagon train you shot up?

493
01:21:38,168 --> 01:21:40,932
- Yeah.
- They never did come back.

494
01:21:41,004 --> 01:21:43,268
I wonder if they're planning
on joining up with 'em.

495
01:22:30,687 --> 01:22:32,814
He say he will not fight them for you.

496
01:22:32,889 --> 01:22:34,584
I understand.

497
01:22:34,657 --> 01:22:37,285
Tell him I just need help
to get through to my people.

498
01:22:42,565 --> 01:22:44,157
They need supplies.

499
01:22:44,234 --> 01:22:49,069
I can pay. Dried meat as much as he
can sell them. Horses, powder and shot.

500
01:22:55,945 --> 01:22:57,378
Five horses.

501
01:22:58,448 --> 01:23:01,849
No powder.
No guns.

502
01:23:05,822 --> 01:23:07,790
Ask him again.

503
01:23:07,857 --> 01:23:10,325
Tell him we're all brothers.

504
01:23:10,393 --> 01:23:13,362
He will not give you guns.
They come too hard.

505
01:23:13,429 --> 01:23:15,488
- Food.
- Dried meat.

506
01:23:17,066 --> 01:23:19,591
Flour. Corn.

507
01:23:19,669 --> 01:23:21,261
Do not ask for more.

508
01:23:21,337 --> 01:23:24,898
He stopped that posse because he gave
his word to let you through safe.

509
01:23:24,974 --> 01:23:26,635
He will do no more.

510
01:23:26,709 --> 01:23:31,043
Ask him again. Tell him they looking
for a land for themselves...

511
01:23:31,114 --> 01:23:33,275
and they'll have to fight their way
to find it...

512
01:23:33,349 --> 01:23:36,341
'cause they can't live
back there no way.

513
01:24:00,677 --> 01:24:04,875
Before the yellow hair, my father,
my grandfather hunted buffalo...

514
01:24:04,948 --> 01:24:07,041
raised pony, and took women
on the land...

515
01:24:07,116 --> 01:24:11,416
where Fox River crosses the grassland
at place of skull.

516
01:24:11,487 --> 01:24:14,456
Now Copper Spring Fort Sheridan.

517
01:24:24,033 --> 01:24:27,230
Now we are here with our backs
against Snow Mountain.

518
01:24:33,743 --> 01:24:38,203
And yellow hair send wagon,
soldier and speaking wire.

519
01:24:44,821 --> 01:24:46,880
Tomorrow we will be like ghosts...

520
01:24:46,956 --> 01:24:50,585
like the spirits that come in dreams
with no earth to walk on.

521
01:24:53,896 --> 01:24:55,830
But we will fight.

522
01:25:05,274 --> 01:25:10,109
We will fight ten tens of years,
and our children's children will fight.

523
01:25:10,179 --> 01:25:13,637
We need our guns, bullets and powder
for our own fight.

524
01:25:15,418 --> 01:25:18,546
Tell him his enemies
are our enemies.

525
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:35,366
He say you black people fought
with that enemy against our people.

526
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,865
I ain't in the army no more.

527
01:25:39,942 --> 01:25:41,933
He knows, Buck.

528
01:25:42,845 --> 01:25:44,676
No guns.

529
01:25:44,747 --> 01:25:46,544
No bullets.

530
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:16,072
Eighteen hundred dollars.
That's your share.

531
01:26:24,887 --> 01:26:29,620
For what we have just received,
we give thanks in Jesus' name. Amen.

532
01:26:32,962 --> 01:26:37,490
I'm goin' back east to Illinois.
And I'm gonna buy me a tent.

533
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:41,094
I'm gonna have the biggest
revival meetin' since King Solomon...

534
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:44,298
preached to his wives
and concubines.

535
01:26:44,373 --> 01:26:45,840
And you, brother...

536
01:26:45,908 --> 01:26:48,206
you got a good woman there.

537
01:26:48,277 --> 01:26:51,508
Take that money and buy yourself
a livin' and do like she want.

538
01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:53,515
Go to Canada.

539
01:26:56,319 --> 01:26:58,344
All right, brother.

540
01:26:58,421 --> 01:27:00,082
One question.

541
01:27:00,156 --> 01:27:02,124
How do I get outta here?

542
01:27:02,191 --> 01:27:03,818
To Illinois?

543
01:27:03,893 --> 01:27:07,693
One or two ways. Back the way we come
and across Kansas.

544
01:27:09,198 --> 01:27:12,531
- There's a posse with a trigger hitch.
- Yes, there is.

545
01:27:12,602 --> 01:27:14,536
What's the other way?

546
01:27:14,604 --> 01:27:17,437
Keep on west across the Pecos
to where I'm going.

547
01:27:17,507 --> 01:27:20,476
Up into the mountains
and north along the Idaho Territory...

548
01:27:20,543 --> 01:27:22,807
and back by the Canadian border.

549
01:27:22,879 --> 01:27:24,813
- How long that take?
- All winter.

550
01:27:24,881 --> 01:27:27,873
All winter. What's my chances
of sneaking past the posse?

551
01:27:29,385 --> 01:27:30,647
Not much.

552
01:27:32,955 --> 01:27:34,923
When I first catched you
eatin' my rabbit...

553
01:27:34,991 --> 01:27:39,553
I should've gotten me a rock, busted you
upside your head and left you for dead.

554
01:28:33,749 --> 01:28:36,650
Scout come in.
That posse did not go back.

555
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:40,155
- They went tracking the wagon train.
- How close are they to the train?

556
01:28:40,223 --> 01:28:42,817
One day ride from the big river.

557
01:28:42,892 --> 01:28:45,554
How long will it take us to catch them
riding straight through?

558
01:28:55,905 --> 01:29:00,308
Maybe two days. He will give you guides
to take you through the high pass.

559
01:29:05,648 --> 01:29:07,980
Remember, they will not fight for you.

560
01:29:09,185 --> 01:29:10,618
I know.

561
01:29:29,639 --> 01:29:31,869
Well, looks like the back door's open.

562
01:29:31,941 --> 01:29:34,671
Figure I can "skeet" on through
and take my chances.

563
01:29:36,879 --> 01:29:42,511
Brother, you done walked more than half
the journey with them Saint Anne folk.

564
01:29:42,585 --> 01:29:46,521
That's all a normal man can do.
What do you wanna die for 'em for?

565
01:30:47,450 --> 01:30:50,010
What happened?
Somebody close the back door?

566
01:31:03,566 --> 01:31:06,126
If they're gonna join up with 'em,
they oughta do it before sundown.

567
01:31:06,202 --> 01:31:08,762
Let's finish off that wagon train.

568
01:31:08,838 --> 01:31:10,772
Ain't broke any laws.

569
01:31:12,208 --> 01:31:17,077
- We gotta turn 'em around.
- What you got against them folks?

570
01:31:17,146 --> 01:31:19,740
You on their side?
You soft in the head for them murderers?

571
01:31:19,815 --> 01:31:21,942
They killed Uncle Bow.
They robbed the bank.

572
01:31:22,018 --> 01:31:24,612
They didn't!
Buck and that preacher did.

573
01:31:24,687 --> 01:31:27,087
That's all we're after.

574
01:31:28,391 --> 01:31:31,554
You don't understand.
I gotta turn them field hands around.

575
01:31:33,162 --> 01:31:37,895
If we leave them fields go fallow now,
we done lost it all.

576
01:31:37,967 --> 01:31:41,960
We gotta keep it goin' like it was,
the way they rightfully belong.

577
01:31:42,038 --> 01:31:45,599
You got 16 white men down there.

578
01:31:45,674 --> 01:31:49,633
Just give me half of 'em,
and I'll finish that job.

579
01:31:50,713 --> 01:31:56,015
As far as I'm concerned, that
wagon train can go anywhere it likes!

580
01:31:59,088 --> 01:32:01,818
You make one move
against those people...

581
01:32:01,891 --> 01:32:06,191
I'll take you back to Copper Springs
tied under the belly of your horse.

582
01:32:27,016 --> 01:32:28,278
Where's Ollie?

583
01:32:28,350 --> 01:32:31,285
Went to cover the pass.
Says you're in charge, Marcus.

584
01:32:31,353 --> 01:32:34,117
Don't let that Buck come through.

585
01:32:34,190 --> 01:32:37,853
- What does he want us to do?
- Take the wagon train.

586
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:43,524
If that's what he said...

587
01:32:43,599 --> 01:32:45,328
let's go!

588
01:33:15,364 --> 01:33:18,265
- You gonna have to take it to 'em.
- What you gonna do?

589
01:33:18,334 --> 01:33:21,064
We can draw them south.
You go with the wagon train.

590
01:33:21,137 --> 01:33:23,628
I'll come to you later.

591
01:34:55,197 --> 01:34:59,031
Get up on top.
Go in front of 'em and cut 'em off.

592
01:38:15,197 --> 01:38:16,459
I run out.
