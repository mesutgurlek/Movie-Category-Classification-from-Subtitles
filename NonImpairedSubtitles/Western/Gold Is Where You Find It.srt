1
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:03,234
1849.

2
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,601
A NATION POURS WEST
IN A MAD FLOOD.

3
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:11,400
GOLD - GOLD IN CALIFORNIA.
GOLD IN THE STREAMS.

4
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:14,701
GOLD AT THE GRASS ROOTS.
GOLD IN THE BLOWING DUST.

5
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:20,267
YELLOW, MALLEABLE, FRIABLE,
SPENDABLE GOLD!

6
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,767
1865.
THE DAYS OF '49 ARE GONE.

7
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:29,400
PICK AND PAN
HAVE GLEANED THE SURFACE,

8
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:32,701
AND THE ADVENTURERS
HAVE MOVED ON TO NEW DIGGINGS.

9
00:01:32,767 --> 00:01:35,267
THE DOORS
OF THEIR DESERTED SHANTIES

10
00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:37,467
SWING IDLE ON BROKEN BOLTS.

11
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:40,968
BUT STILL A WAR-WEARY,
LAND-HUNGRY PEOPLE

12
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:45,667
SWEEPS WESTWARD WHERE A NEW GOLD
IS COME OUT OF CALIFORNIA.

13
00:01:55,267 --> 00:01:58,133
THE PLOWS RIP THE FALLOW LAWN.

14
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,601
FOR THIS IS THE NEW GOLD,

15
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:03,834
THE FLOWING YELLOW GOLD
OF WHEAT.

16
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:12,734
IN '68 THE SEED IS SOWN.

17
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:16,300
ITS ROOTS SUCK
THE DARK RICHNESS BELOW.

18
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:20,133
ITS TOPS STAND GOLDEN
IN A GOLDEN SUNLIGHT,

19
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,400
AND THE GREAT WHEAT EMPIRE
IS BORN.

20
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:25,400
FOR 10 YEARS IT FLOURISHES.

21
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:29,234
THEN AGAIN THE NEWS
FLASHES EASTWARD - GOLD!

22
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,033
GOLD ABOVE THE VALLEY
OF THE SACRAMENTO.

23
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,868
GOLD AND A WAY TO GET AT IT.

24
00:02:33,934 --> 00:02:36,400
AGAIN THE ADVENTURERS
RUSH WESTWARD.

25
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:39,400
BUT THIS TIME,
THEY COME IN PUSHING PULLMANS.

26
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:41,067
NO MORE PICK-AND-PAN SCRATCHING.

27
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:45,367
THIS IS 1877.
THIS IS BEDROCK GOLD.

28
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:48,033
GREAT SQUAT HYDRAULIC MONITORS,

29
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,567
WITH THE PRESSURE
OF THE MELTING SNOWS

30
00:02:50,634 --> 00:02:53,968
OF THE HIGH SIERRAS BEHIND THEM,
RIP THE MOUNTAINS APART.

31
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:55,334
MONEY AND MACHINES -

32
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,000
A NEW MIDAS TEARING APART
THE QUIET HILLS,

33
00:02:58,067 --> 00:03:00,167
LEAVING A RAW WELTER.

34
00:03:00,234 --> 00:03:03,400
GOLD AND YET MORE GOLD.

35
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:20,834
OUT OF A SINGLE SLUICE BOX
IN A SINGLE SPRING

36
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,834
IS SNATCHED A MILLION DOLLARS.

37
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:25,834
GOLD FOR SHIPS AND SCHOOLS
AND CITIES.

38
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:29,167
GOLD FOR GUNS
AND THE SINEWS OF WAR.

39
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:31,501
POURING EASTWARD, IT CHOKES
THE CHANNELS OF COMMERCE.

40
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:34,334
IT TRAVELS THE WEALTH
OF THE WORLD.

41
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,901
AND FOR EVERY
PRECIOUS YELLOW OUNCE,

42
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:40,834
TONS OF MUD, GRAVEL, AND RUBBLE
ARE DUMPED INTO THE STREAMS

43
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:43,634
THAT FEED THE GOLDEN
WHEAT EMPIRE BELOW.

44
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:46,767
THE FLOODS SPREAD.
THE WHEAT RANCHERS PROTEST.

45
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:48,334
BUT UP IN THE MOUNTAINS,

46
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,334
THE MONITORS LASH OUT
THEIR YELLING TONGUES.

47
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,667
WHERE THERE IS GOLD,
MEN ARE GOING TO GET IT.

48
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:57,968
KNEE-DEEP
IN THEIR FLOODED FIELDS,

49
00:03:58,033 --> 00:04:01,367
THE RANCHERS WATCH THEIR GOLDEN
ACRES STRANGLE AND DIE.

50
00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:02,934
DIKES AND LEVIES BREAK

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,100
AND ARE PATIENTLY,
DESPERATELY PLUGGED AGAIN.

52
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:07,934
AND SLOWLY, SULLENLY,

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,467
THEY SET THEMSELVES
FOR THE LONG, BITTER FIGHT

54
00:04:11,534 --> 00:04:13,701
AGAINST THE POWER OF GOLD.

55
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,267
THOSE TWO IN THE MIDDLE!

56
00:04:40,334 --> 00:04:43,133
MUCH OBLIGED.
YES, SIR.

57
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:50,534
HEY, WATCH OUT.

58
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:26,033
HOWDY, SIR. WELCOME TO TENSPOT. YEAH.

59
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:38,033
MR. WHITNEY.
DRUMMER, I TAKE IT?

60
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,767
WELL, YOU CAN TAKE IT STRAIGHT
OR WITH WATER.

61
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:41,100
IT'S A FREE COUNTRY.

62
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:42,434
YOU MIGHT BE
AN EASTERN TOURIST?

63
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:43,868
MIGHT.
WHERE'S THIS ROOM?

64
00:05:43,934 --> 00:05:45,067
THE SECOND FLOOR, FRONT.

65
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:47,067
OH, SAY.
DID YOU SAY YOU WAS A DRUMMER?

66
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:48,767
WELL, NOW, YOU KNOW,
I USED TO DRUM -

67
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:50,501
PLAYED THE BASS DRUM
IN THE TOWN BAND.

68
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:52,234
BUT I LOST IT ONCE
PLAYING FOR A PICNIC.

69
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:08,734
THREE WHISKEYS.

70
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:12,367
THIS STUFF TASTES
LIKE VARNISH.

71
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:14,300
WHY DON'T YOU GET SOME
DECENT WHISKEY?

72
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:16,501
GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE.

73
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:18,901
MR. LANCE, DON'T YOU THINK
YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH?

74
00:06:18,968 --> 00:06:20,801
NOBODY ASKED YOU
WHAT YOU THOUGHT.

75
00:06:20,868 --> 00:06:22,467
ALL I WANT FROM YOU
IS THAT BOTTLE OF RYE,

76
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:23,534
AND I WANT IT QUICK.

77
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:26,033
ALL RIGHT.

78
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,367
YOU'RE FERRIS' BOY,
AREN'T YOU?

79
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:29,033
YEAH, WHAT ABOUT IT?

80
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,601
TAKE IT EASY, LANCE.

81
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:32,334
GO ON HOME. THIS IS NO PLACE
FOR DRUNKEN LITTLE BOYS.

82
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,033
WHY DON'T YOU MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS?

83
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,100
YOU MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

84
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:38,000
TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF ME!

85
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:02,000
ALL RIGHT, BOYS.
THE FIGHT'S OVER.

86
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:03,434
I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM.

87
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:05,534
HERE. HAVE A DRINK.

88
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:26,701
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

89
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:30,167
SOBER AS A JUDGE.

90
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:31,601
WHY DID YOU HIT ME?

91
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:34,701
BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU WERE
TOO YOUNG TO DIE.

92
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:36,200
THANKS.

93
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:37,901
COME ON.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

94
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:39,634
HERE'S YOUR HAT.

95
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,567
HOWDY, MR. LANCE.

96
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:56,400
HOWDY, JOSHUA.

97
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:58,868
COME ON IN, MR. WHITNEY.

98
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:01,868
COME IN, MR. WHITNEY.
THANKS.

99
00:08:01,934 --> 00:08:03,601
HE'S ALL RIGHT.
DOWN, BOY.

100
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:06,133
COME ON.
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.

101
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,801
LET ME TAKE YOUR HAT.

102
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:09,033
THANK YOU.

103
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,334
LANCE, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
WHY - OH.

104
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,367
THIS IS MY SISTER SERENA,
MR. WHITNEY.

105
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:17,734
HELLO.

106
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,234
HOW DO YOU DO?
BUT -

107
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,300
WHY DON'T YOU WIPE YOUR
MOUTH? IT'S ALL OVER APPLE.

108
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:26,267
YOU WAIT. YOU'RE GONNA CATCH IT,
MR. FERRIS.

109
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:27,968
OH, LANCE,
WHAT DID YOU DO TO CZAR?

110
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:29,501
HE CAME HOME
THIS MORNING LAME.

111
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,501
I KNOW. I KNOW.
I'M SORRY.

112
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:34,000
LISTEN, SPRAT, HOW ABOUT TELLING
FATHER WE'RE HERE?

113
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:35,467
TELL HIM I'VE GOT A GUEST.

114
00:08:35,534 --> 00:08:37,601
YOU KNOW, KIND OF HONEY HIM
A LITTLE.

115
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:38,868
THERE'S A SWEET KID.

116
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:41,300
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
HE'S AWFULLY MAD, LANCE.

117
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:42,934
WELL, TRY.

118
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,467
ALL RIGHT. I'LL TRY.

119
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,634
SHE CAN GENERALLY
HANDLE HIM.

120
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:51,968
I HOPE SO.

121
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:54,100
LOOK. DON'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BAR.

122
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,834
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
THANKS.

123
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:01,167
LANCE.
LANCE, HE WANTS YOU.

124
00:09:01,234 --> 00:09:03,501
UH-OH.
THANKS, SPRAT.

125
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:04,834
BE NICE, LANCE.
PLEASE.

126
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:07,000
DON'T WORRY. I'LL BE NICE.
WELL, HERE GOES.

127
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,167
GOOD LUCK.

128
00:09:08,234 --> 00:09:11,033
I'LL NEED IT.

129
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,200
WELL, I HOPE YOUR FATHER

130
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:13,868
WON'T BE TOO HARD ON HIM,
MISS FERRIS.

131
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:16,601
LANCE IS SO TRIFLING
SOMETIMES THAT...

132
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:25,100
HAVE AN APPLE,
MR. WHITNEY.

133
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:27,067
AN APPLE?
YES.

134
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:31,367
OH. OH.
THANKS VERY MUCH.

135
00:09:33,734 --> 00:09:35,067
WHY DO YOU DO THAT?

136
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:36,567
OH, THAT?
HABIT, I GUESS.

137
00:09:36,634 --> 00:09:38,467
BACK HOME IN VERMONT,
WE TEST THEM THAT WAY.

138
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:40,000
YEAH, IT'S CALLED
APPLE-KNOCKING.

139
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:41,567
WELL, HOW CAN YOU TELL?

140
00:09:41,634 --> 00:09:44,634
WELL, IF IT SOUNDS - PLUNK
- LIKE THAT, IT'S MELLOW.

141
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:46,801
BUT IF IT JUST CLINKS,
WHY, IT HASN'T SET YET.

142
00:09:46,868 --> 00:09:48,033
HERE, YOU TRY ONE.

143
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,601
SEE? THEY BOTH PLUNK.

144
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:55,734
I NEVER KNEW THAT.

145
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:57,567
WELL, KIDS, YOU KNOW.

146
00:09:57,634 --> 00:09:59,534
WELL, THAT IS -
THAT IS, VERY YOUNG LADIES -

147
00:09:59,601 --> 00:10:01,334
THEY DON'T GENERALLY BOTHER
ABOUT THESE THINGS.

148
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,067
YOU KNOW, THEY GENERALLY
TAKE THEM AS THEY COME,

149
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:04,400
GREEN OR OTHERWISE.

150
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:06,601
I'M NOT SO YOUNG AS YOU THINK,
MR. WHITNEY. I'M 17.

151
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:07,701
NO.

152
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:08,968
WELL, ALMOST 17.

153
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:10,133
OH.

154
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,133
AND I'VE GOT A 50-ACRE
FRUIT ORCHARD OF MY OWN.

155
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,133
YOU HAVE?

156
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,434
YES, I HAVE.

157
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:16,100
THAT IS,
IT'S ON MY FATHER'S LAND,

158
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,634
AND I USE HIS TEAMS
AND LABOR.

159
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:20,100
BUT I PAID FOR MY OWN TREES,
AND I DO MY OWN PRUNING,

160
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:21,567
AND I RUN
A TWO-HORSE HARROW.

161
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:23,667
YOU DO?

162
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:27,133
PERHAPS YOU TELL ME
WHAT'S SO VERY FUNNY?

163
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,334
WELL, I WILL, NOW,
IF YOU PROMISE NOT TO GET MAD.

164
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,868
PROMISE?
YES.

165
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:33,501
THEY SAY THAT CALIFORNIA
HAS THE SMALLEST STOVES

166
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,968
AND THE BIGGEST LIARS
IN THE UNITED STATES.

167
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:40,133
I THINK LANCE WILL BE BACK
IN A FEW MINUTES.

168
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,400
NOW, PLEASE, MISS FERRIS.

169
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:42,834
YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T GET MAD.
I'M SORRY.

170
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:44,133
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

171
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,734
OH, SURE, I BELIEVE YOU.
50-ACRE ORCHARD.

172
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:48,300
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT?

173
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:50,033
YES,
I'D LIKE IT VERY MUCH.

174
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,701
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SHOW IT TO YOU.

175
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:53,133
50 ACRES, HUH?
LET'S SEE.

176
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,367
THAT OUGHT TO BRING IN
ABOUT A...

177
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:55,601
A 1,000-BUSHEL CROP,
HUH?

178
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:58,267
1,500, MR. WHITNEY,
WHEN THE TREES ARE REALLY SET.

179
00:10:58,334 --> 00:10:59,601
WELL, MAYBE.

180
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:01,767
YOU KNOW, THIS OUGHT TO BE
PRETTY GOOD FRUIT COUNTRY.

181
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:04,100
THESE ARE VERY GOOD APPLES.
WEREN'T GROWN HERE, WERE THEY?

182
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:05,400
NO, THEY WEREN'T.

183
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:06,901
I DIDN'T THINK SO.
THEY NEED SNOW.

184
00:11:06,968 --> 00:11:08,033
NITROGEN GOES IN THE SOIL,

185
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,868
BUT POTASH REALLY GIVES THEM
THEIR FLAVOR.

186
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:13,934
WELL, YOU DO KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT FRUIT, DON'T YOU?

187
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,267
MM-HMM. A LITTLE.

188
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:19,601
MR. WHITNEY.

189
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:21,734
LANCE HAS BEEN TELLING ME
ABOUT YOUR KINDNESS.

190
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:22,801
HAPPY TO MEET YOU, SIR.

191
00:11:22,868 --> 00:11:24,167
PLEASURE, SIR.

192
00:11:24,234 --> 00:11:26,901
FATHER, MR. WHITNEY'S BEEN
TELLING ME ABOUT CALIFORNIA.

193
00:11:26,968 --> 00:11:28,734
HE SAYS WE HAVE
THE SMALLEST STOVES

194
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:32,400
AND THE BIGGEST LIARS
IN THE UNITED STATES.

195
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:35,400
WELL, I NEVER NOTICED
ABOUT THE STOVES.

196
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:38,067
ANYHOW, WE DO HAVE
THE BEST NATIVE BRANDY.

197
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:40,501
DARE SAY WE COULD FIND A USE
FOR SOME.

198
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,167
COME ALONG, MR. WHITNEY.

199
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,901
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.

200
00:11:56,234 --> 00:11:58,667
LANCE TELLS ME YOU'RE
A MINING MAN, MR. WHITNEY.

201
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:01,133
USED TO BE A FARMER,
BUT THEY SENT ME TO SCHOOL,

202
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,033
AND SOMEHOW I CAME OUT
AN ENGINEER.

203
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,367
AND SOMETIMES I THINK THAT'S
GETTING TO BE THE TROUBLE

204
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:08,701
WITH THIS COUNTRY -
TOO MUCH EDUCATION.

205
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:12,200
YOUNG FELLAS LIKE YOU
START DRAWING LINES ON PAPER,

206
00:12:12,267 --> 00:12:14,734
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
THERE'S A SNORTING TIN TEAKETTLE

207
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,167
RUNNING ABOUT ON RAILS,

208
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:18,634
RUSHING PEOPLE FROM ONE PLACE
TO THE OTHER AND BACK AGAIN.

209
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:19,801
SAY IT SAVES TIME.

210
00:12:19,868 --> 00:12:21,901
MAYBE YOU CAN TELL ME,
MR. WHITNEY -

211
00:12:21,968 --> 00:12:23,033
SAVES TIME FOR WHAT?

212
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,200
MORE LINES ON PAPER.

213
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:26,067
AND THEN THE NEXT THING
WE KNOW,

214
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:28,601
THERE'S A MACHINE THEY CALL
A HYDRAULIC MONITOR

215
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:30,434
TEARING A MOUNTAIN
TO PIECES.

216
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:32,167
DON'T LET FATHER
GET STARTED ON SLICKINGS

217
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:33,534
OR WE'LL BE HERE ALL DAY.

218
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:35,267
WELL, I'M SORRY IF THEY'RE
MAKING TROUBLE FOR YOU, SIR.

219
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:37,133
OH, THERE'S NOTHING PERSONAL
IN IT, MR. WHITNEY.

220
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,601
WON'T YOU SIT DOWN?

221
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:41,934
OUR QUARREL ISN'T WITH YOU.
IT'S WITH YOUR BOSSES.

222
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,901
THEY'RE CALLED PIRATES
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

223
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:46,701
WELL, I DON'T THINK
IT'S THEIR FAULT EITHER, SIR.

224
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,267
IT'S A MATTER
OF PUSHING AHEAD.

225
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,000
NO ONE WANTS TO HARM
THE RANCHERS.

226
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:52,267
BUT THE STUFF'S THERE,
AND WE'VE GOT TO GET IT OUT.

227
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:53,901
IF WE DIDN'T,
SOMEONE ELSE WOULD.

228
00:12:53,968 --> 00:12:55,234
IT'S SOMETHING
YOU CAN'T STOP

229
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,334
ANY MORE THAN YOU CAN STOP

230
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,968
FROM PUTTING RAILS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

231
00:12:58,033 --> 00:12:59,133
MATTER OF PROGRESS.

232
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,501
WE'LL STOP IT,
MR. WHITNEY,

233
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:02,133
WHEN THE COURTS
GET AROUND TO IT.

234
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,767
I'M READY, MR. WHITNEY!

235
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:15,934
READY FOR WHAT?

236
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,767
MR. WHITNEY WANTS TO SEE
MY ORCHARD.

237
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:19,434
YOU SAID YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IT,
DIDN'T YOU?

238
00:13:19,501 --> 00:13:21,100
WELL, YES -
JARED'S GOING WITH ME.

239
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,801
WE'VE GOT SOME THINGS
TO TALK OVER.

240
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,534
WELL, I'D LIKE TO SEE IT
VERY MUCH.

241
00:13:24,601 --> 00:13:27,000
GO ON OVER TO YOUR ORCHARDS,
SPRAT, AND LEAVE US ALONE.

242
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:28,167
COME ON, JARED.

243
00:13:28,234 --> 00:13:29,167
WELL,
I'M SORRY, BUT...

244
00:13:29,234 --> 00:13:30,467
IT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.

245
00:13:30,534 --> 00:13:32,300
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE WE COULD
MAKE IT SOME OTHER TIME.

246
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:33,634
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

247
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:35,300
WE'RE IN A HURRY, SPRAT.

248
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:37,033
GOODBYE.

249
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,767
IT'S UP TO YOU, ED.

250
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:34,901
I'LL BET 4 RIGHT
INTO THAT ONE-CARD DRAW.

251
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:36,400
I'M OUT.
I'LL JUST STAY.

252
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:37,467
HEY!

253
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:41,667
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN HERE?

254
00:14:41,734 --> 00:14:43,234
COULDN'T YOU READ THAT SIGN
ON THE GATE?

255
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,701
I DID READ IT.
WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE?

256
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,267
YOU'RE LOOKING
AT THE HEADMAN RIGHT NOW.

257
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:47,501
I'LL RAISE
YOU 4.

258
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:48,767
WELL, IF YOU'RE IN CHARGE,
WHAT'S -

259
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:50,767
NO, WE AIN'T HIRING NOBODY
TODAY, MISTER,

260
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:52,834
SO BE SURE YOU CLOSE THE GATE
ON YOUR WAY OUT.

261
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:54,501
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH THOSE MONITORS?

262
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:55,634
THEY'RE NOT WORKING.

263
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:56,968
SAY, WHO ARE YOU -

264
00:14:57,033 --> 00:14:59,667
CYRUS McCORMICK
ON A TOUR OF INSPECTION?

265
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:01,934
WHITNEY'S THE NAME.
I'M THE NEW SUPERINTENDENT.

266
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,167
SUPERINTENDENT, EH?

267
00:15:04,234 --> 00:15:08,300
I BETTER CLEAN THOSE FLUMES
ON THE NORTH END.

268
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:11,634
"INTRODUCING
MR. JARED WHITNEY."

269
00:15:11,701 --> 00:15:14,601
LOOKS LIKE WE GOT
A WHOLE NEW SUPERINTENDENT.

270
00:15:15,834 --> 00:15:17,234
I BET HE WAS
EVEN TO COLLEGE, BOYS.

271
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,701
ONE OF THEM NEW
DUDE ENGINEERS, HUH?

272
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:21,367
I ASKED YOU A QUESTION.

273
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:23,167
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THOSE MONITORS?

274
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:24,534
YONDER THEY LIE.

275
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:26,501
MAYBE YOU CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEM, WILLIE.

276
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:28,834
MAYBE.
AND THE NAME ISN'T WILLIE.

277
00:15:28,901 --> 00:15:30,934
IT'S WHITNEY -
MR. WHITNEY.

278
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,000
WHY, YOU...

279
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:46,133
IS IT TIGHT?

280
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,133
YES, SIR.

281
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,968
THE BOLTS WERE LOOSE.
YES, SIR.

282
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:51,534
THAT'S WHAT HELD
YOUR PRESSURE BACK.

283
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:56,601
ALL RIGHT! TURN THEM ON!
FULL PRESSURE!

284
00:15:56,667 --> 00:16:00,767
AIM HER HIGH.
WATCH THAT KNOB, NOW.

285
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,901
GIVE A HAND.

286
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:13,400
NOW, LISTEN, MR. MINTON.

287
00:16:13,467 --> 00:16:16,167
THE COMPANY SENT ME DOWN HERE
TO TAKE CHARGE OF THIS MINE

288
00:16:16,234 --> 00:16:17,901
BECAUSE
YOU'RE BEHIND SCHEDULE.

289
00:16:17,968 --> 00:16:19,267
CONSEQUENTLY,
YOU CAN GET YOUR TIME

290
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:20,434
AND GET OUT, OR GO TO WORK.

291
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:21,834
AND THAT GOES
FOR THE REST OF YOU.

292
00:16:27,234 --> 00:16:28,300
WELL, WHAT ABOUT IT?

293
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,567
YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID.
GET BACK TO WORK.

294
00:16:30,634 --> 00:16:31,601
MY, MY.

295
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:38,300
ALL RIGHT, MORE WATER!

296
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:41,234
TAKE IT OFF THE OVERBURDEN
AND HIT IT ON THE GRAVEL!

297
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,701
AND DO IT RIGHT!

298
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:46,601
THE NEW BOSS WILL MAKE YOU
GO TO COLLEGE AND LEARN HOW!

299
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:18,567
LOOK AT THAT -

300
00:18:18,634 --> 00:18:20,767
MUDDYING UP THE RIVERS
WITH THEIR DIRTY MESS,

301
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,767
RUINING OUR FIELDS
WITH THEIR SLICKINGS,

302
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:24,300
SPOILING THE COUNTRY.

303
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:26,234
THE LAW DON'T LET YOU STAND UP
ON A MOUNTAIN

304
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,267
AND FLING MUD IN THE FACE
OF A MAN DOWN BELOW.

305
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:30,100
CALIFORNIA'S A GOLD STATE,
CHRIS -

306
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:31,434
ALWAYS HAS BEEN.

307
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:33,701
THAT HYDRAULICKING CROWD'S
GOT MONEY AND SMART LAWYERS.

308
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:35,367
I TELL YOU,
WE CAN'T STOP THEM.

309
00:18:35,434 --> 00:18:36,767
SMARTEST LAWYERS
IN THE WORLD

310
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:38,767
CAN'T CHANGE WHAT'S RIGHT
AND WHAT'S WRONG.

311
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:39,868
THAT'S WHAT SUTTER SAID.

312
00:18:39,934 --> 00:18:41,801
HE THOUGHT THE LAW WOULD PROTECT
HIS PLANTINGS

313
00:18:41,868 --> 00:18:43,033
AGAINST THE GOLD RUSH.

314
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,167
THAT WAS YEARS AGO, RALPH,
BEFORE ANY LAW WAS OUT HERE.

315
00:18:45,234 --> 00:18:46,567
WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

316
00:18:46,634 --> 00:18:49,067
SUTTER SAW CALIFORNIA FOR WHAT
IT IS AND OUGHT TO BE -

317
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:50,868
THE FINEST PLANTING COUNTRY
ON EARTH.

318
00:18:50,934 --> 00:18:52,033
AND LOOK AT SUTTER NOW.

319
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,734
BROKE AS A JAYBIRD.

320
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:55,467
WHO ASKED YOU,
YOU MEDDLING OLD FOOL?

321
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,300
BRING EVERY HAND ON THE PLACE
DOWN HERE

322
00:18:57,367 --> 00:18:59,033
AND FIX THESE LEVIES
LIKE I TOLD YOU.

323
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,667
YES, SIR, COLONEL.

324
00:19:00,734 --> 00:19:03,534
TIME FOR DINNER, RALPH.
ENOCH, GO PICK UP MISS SERENA.

325
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:04,901
YES, YOUR HONOR.

326
00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:06,067
COME ON, JOSHUA.

327
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:07,801
BETTER TAKE A SEAT
IN THE BACK THERE

328
00:19:07,868 --> 00:19:09,901
WHERE YOU'LL BE SAFE
FROM THE RISING WATER.

329
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:20,434
COME ON, JIM!

330
00:19:24,267 --> 00:19:27,167
WHOA.

331
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:29,067
DINNERTIME, MISS SERENA!

332
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:32,367
YOUR FATHER AND YOUR UNCLE RALPH
HAVE ALREADY GONE AHEAD.

333
00:19:32,434 --> 00:19:34,567
ALL RIGHT, ENOCH!
JUST A MINUTE!

334
00:19:34,634 --> 00:19:37,300
WHOA, JIM!
HO, HO, HO!

335
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:39,300
COME ON.
COME TAKE THE LINES.

336
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:40,834
HOW DOES MY ORCHARD LOOK?

337
00:19:40,901 --> 00:19:43,834
LOOKS SORT OF LIKE YOU DID
THAT AGE - ALL LEGS.

338
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:46,601
WELL, YOU JUST WAIT
AND SEE.

339
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:47,868
IN TWO MORE YEARS,

340
00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:49,400
THEY'LL BE THE BIGGEST TREES
YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

341
00:19:49,467 --> 00:19:52,033
MAYBE SO, IF THEM SLICKINGS
DON'T COVER THEM UP.

342
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,000
GIDDAP.
DOWN, THOR.

343
00:19:54,067 --> 00:20:00,000
OH, I'LL NEVER BE FOOLED
BY A GAL

344
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:03,334
NEVER BE FOOLED BY A GAL

345
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,667
WHEN SHE LOOKS AT YOU
AND WINKS HER EYE

346
00:20:05,734 --> 00:20:07,901
THEN YOU KNOW DARN WELL
IT'S JUST A LIE

347
00:20:07,968 --> 00:20:11,801
I'LL NEVER BE FOOLED
BY A GAL

348
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:21,334
LANCE, YOU SAMPLED THAT BRANDY
PRETTY WELL BEFORE DINNER.

349
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,267
THANKS FOR THE CHECKUP,
AUNT ROSANNE.

350
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:25,267
LANCE, IF I -

351
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:26,734
WELL, THERE NEVER
WAS A FERRIS

352
00:20:26,801 --> 00:20:28,167
WHO COULDN'T
HOLD HIS LIQUOR.

353
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:29,167
I'LL JOIN YOU.

354
00:20:29,234 --> 00:20:31,501
RAMON, THE BRANDY.

355
00:20:32,601 --> 00:20:34,434
DOWN, THOR.
YOU ALREADY BIT HIM ONCE.

356
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:36,801
THAT ANIMAL PETRIFIES ME.
IT ISN'T SAFE AROUND HERE.

357
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:38,501
SERENA CAN USE HIM
IN THE ORCHARD.

358
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:40,167
SHE'LL NEED
SOME PROTECTION THERE.

359
00:20:40,234 --> 00:20:41,767
HA. FOOL ORCHARD.

360
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:44,834
TAKING UP 50 GOOD ACRES OF LAND
TO MESS AROUND WITH FRUIT.

361
00:20:44,901 --> 00:20:47,367
WELL, AT LEAST THEY'LL BE
PEACHES AND PLUMS IN THE HOUSE.

362
00:20:47,434 --> 00:20:49,567
I RECKON YOU'LL BE GLAD ENOUGH
TO EAT THE FRUIT.

363
00:20:49,634 --> 00:20:51,367
I'LL HAVE 1,000 BUSHELS
NEXT YEAR,

364
00:20:51,434 --> 00:20:52,601
AND THEY'LL BRING US $800.

365
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:56,767
YOU'LL SAVE THE FAMILY FORTUNE
AT THE EXPENSE OF YOUR LOOKS.

366
00:20:56,834 --> 00:20:58,033
IT ISN'T WORTH IT, SERENA.

367
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,334
LOOK AT YOUR HANDS.
THEY'RE LIKE WHIP LEATHER.

368
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,200
SHE'S MAKING A FOOL OF HERSELF.
GOES AROUND LIKE A LABORER.

369
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:05,467
HMM. LOOK AT YOU. IF YOU'D
EVEN LOOK LIKE A DECENT LABORER,

370
00:21:05,534 --> 00:21:06,634
INSTEAD OF
A MISERABLE DUDE.

371
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:07,968
IF YOU'D QUIT
LIQUORING UP -

372
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,834
SHUT YOUR HEAD, SPRAT!

373
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,667
LANCEFORD, YOU'LL APOLOGIZE
FOR THAT REMARK.

374
00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:13,067
DO YOU HEAR ME?

375
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:14,200
I BEG YOUR PARDON.

376
00:21:14,267 --> 00:21:16,100
I'M SURE
YOU DIDN'T INTEND IT.

377
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:19,300
AND, SERENA, YOU LEAVE THE TABLE
FOR LOSING YOUR TEMPER.

378
00:21:21,968 --> 00:21:24,634
BUT YOU DO LOOK LIKE A DUDE,
AND YOU DO LIQUOR UP!

379
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,868
SERENA.
AND YOU WON'T WORK.

380
00:21:29,234 --> 00:21:32,567
CHRIS, I DO WISH YOU'D CHAIN UP
THAT AWFUL BEAST.

381
00:21:32,634 --> 00:21:34,767
WHAT'S THE GOOD OF A DOG
LIKE THAT ANYHOW?

382
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:37,133
FOR ONE THING, TO SCARE OFF
THAT MINING RIFFRAFF

383
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,100
IF THEY EVER SET FOOT
ON MY LAND AGAIN.

384
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:40,601
THE TROUBLE WITH YOU,
FATHER,

385
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,901
IS THAT YOU'RE NOT WILLING
TO ACCEPT ADVANCEMENT.

386
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,901
GOLD IS UNDER THE SOIL,
NOT ON TOP OF IT.

387
00:21:44,968 --> 00:21:47,234
FARMING WAS ALL RIGHT
IN ITS DAY.

388
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,200
LANCEFORD, THAT DOG
AT LEAST HAS BREEDING.

389
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,501
IT KNOWS A MINE-MUCKER FROM
A GENTLEMAN EVEN IF YOU DON'T.

390
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:54,133
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO BE, FATHER?

391
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,901
I'M SURE THAT LANCE
ONLY MEANT TO BE -

392
00:21:55,968 --> 00:21:57,634
THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU,
AUNT ROSANNE,

393
00:21:57,701 --> 00:21:59,667
BUT I'LL DO MY OWN EXPLAINING -
IF I HAVE TO.

394
00:21:59,734 --> 00:22:02,567
YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, SIR.

395
00:22:04,634 --> 00:22:06,334
OH, BE FAIR
WITH THE BOY, CHRIS.

396
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,567
YOU CAN'T EXPECT HIM
TO BE A PLASTER SAINT.

397
00:22:08,634 --> 00:22:09,734
ONLY ONE THING BOTHERS ME.

398
00:22:09,801 --> 00:22:11,567
HE'S A LOT LESS INTERESTED
IN THIS RANCH

399
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:13,100
THAN HE IS
IN THAT MINING CROWD.

400
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:15,467
I WOULDN'T MIND HIS KICKING
AROUND WITH HIS OWN CLASS,

401
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,400
BUT THIS SCUM OF THE EARTH
FROM THE MINES.

402
00:22:17,467 --> 00:22:18,801
HOLD ON, CHRIS.

403
00:22:18,868 --> 00:22:21,067
SOME OF THE BIGGEST MEN IN
CALIFORNIA CAME OUT OF MINING.

404
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:23,133
WITH THE IDEALS AND TRADITIONS
OF HIGHWAYMEN.

405
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,801
THAT SAN FRANCISCO
MINING CROWD -

406
00:22:24,868 --> 00:22:25,934
CHRIS, YOU DARE SAY THAT.

407
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,234
WHY -
WHY MY OWN FATHER -

408
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,467
THERE, SWEETHEART.

409
00:22:29,534 --> 00:22:31,400
I'M SURE CHRIS DIDN'T MEAN
YOUR FATHER.

410
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:32,834
OF - OF COURSE NOT.

411
00:22:32,901 --> 00:22:35,834
I NEVER FIGURED YOU'D THINK
I MEANT A MAN LIKE HIM.

412
00:22:35,901 --> 00:22:38,801
WHY, HARRISON McCOOEY, ROSANNE,
YOUR FATHER?

413
00:22:38,868 --> 00:22:41,000
EVERYBODY RESPECTS HIM.

414
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:44,334
THANK YOU, CHRIS.
I SUPPOSE IT WAS SILLY OF ME.

415
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,901
FORGIVE ME.
DON'T BE LATE, DARLING.

416
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:56,334
WELL, I SUPPOSE I'LL BE ACCUSED
NOW OF LOSING MY TEMPER.

417
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,133
HAVE A CIGAR, RALPH.

418
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,400
YOU KNOW, CHRIS,
SERENA TAKES AFTER YOU.

419
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:01,467
SHE'S STUBBORN.

420
00:23:01,534 --> 00:23:03,334
BUT LANCE WAS RIGHT
IN ONE RESPECT.

421
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,567
ABOUT WHAT?

422
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,033
WHEAT'S A THING
OF THE PAST.

423
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,934
THERE'S STUFF IN THE GROUND
OF CALIFORNIA

424
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,801
YOU NEVER PLANTED,
AND IT'LL SWAMP YOU.

425
00:23:09,868 --> 00:23:12,267
WHEREVER THERE'S GOLD, CHRIS,
MEN ARE GOING TO FIND IT.

426
00:23:12,334 --> 00:23:13,501
NOT AGAINST THE LAW.

427
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:15,634
THE DECISION WAS AGAINST THEM
IN THE COURTS LAST YEAR.

428
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:16,834
NOW HOW LONG WILL IT STAND

429
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:18,801
WITH ALL THAT MONEY STACKED UP
AGAINST IT?

430
00:23:18,868 --> 00:23:20,501
HERE, THAT'S NO WAY
TO CUT A CIGAR.

431
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:23,133
IT'S MY WAY.

432
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,567
WHY, 10 YEARS FROM NOW,

433
00:23:24,634 --> 00:23:28,133
THE WHOLE SACRAMENTO VALLEY
WILL BE UNDER MUD AND SLICKINGS.

434
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,334
QUIT MAKING SPEECHES AND TELL ME
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND.

435
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,701
CHRIS, I WANT TO SELL.

436
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:37,701
I'VE DECIDED
TO GET INTO GOLD.

437
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:41,400
YOU'D SELL YOUR LAND?
MY OWN BROTHER?

438
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:42,901
YOU'RE TALKING CRAZY.

439
00:23:42,968 --> 00:23:44,133
IF YOU THINK SO,

440
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,467
MAKE ME AN OFFER FOR MY SHARE
OF BANNOCKBURN.

441
00:23:46,534 --> 00:23:49,133
NOW, LOOK HERE, RALPH.
I USED TO PUT DIAPERS ON YOU.

442
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,767
I'LL DO IT AGAIN IF YOU DON'T
QUIT THIS FOOLISHNESS.

443
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:54,200
WHY, IN 200 YEARS,
NO FERRIS HAS SOLD HIS LAND,

444
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:56,300
EXCEPT TO BUY MORE LAND.

445
00:23:56,367 --> 00:23:59,534
COME ON.
HAVE A BALL OF BRANDY.

446
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:02,033
AND TELL ROSANNE
I MEANT NO OFFENSE.

447
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,968
I'VE ASKED YOU TO MAKE ME
AN OFFER, CHRIS.

448
00:24:06,033 --> 00:24:09,067
WELL, THEN, EVEN THOUGH WHEAT
IS SELLING LOW,

449
00:24:09,133 --> 00:24:13,467
AND JUST TO SHOW YOU HOW WRONG
YOU ARE, $100,000.

450
00:24:13,534 --> 00:24:15,734
IT'S A TRADE.

451
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:18,767
RALPH,
YOU WOULDN'T SELL YOUR LAND.

452
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:20,467
I SAID IT WAS A TRADE.

453
00:24:20,534 --> 00:24:22,133
CASH OF COURSE.

454
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,634
CASH?

455
00:24:24,701 --> 00:24:26,934
I THOUGHT MY CHECK
WOULD BE SUFFICIENT.

456
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,601
STILL, IF YOU INSIST.

457
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,934
CHRIS, DON'T BE SILLY.
OF COURSE YOUR CHECK IS GOOD.

458
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,200
I ONLY WANTED TO GET -

459
00:24:33,267 --> 00:24:35,200
YOU'LL GET YOUR CASH.

460
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:39,100
ALL I ASK IS THAT YOU'LL BE GONE
FROM HERE BY THE MORNING.

461
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:51,701
HI, YOUNGSTER!

462
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,000
WELL, HELLO.

463
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:04,734
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
AREN'T WE ON SPEAKING TERMS?

464
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:06,467
HELLO.

465
00:25:06,534 --> 00:25:07,667
OOH.

466
00:25:07,734 --> 00:25:09,501
WELL, PERHAPS I BETTER COME BACK
SOME OTHER TIME

467
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:12,667
WHEN YOU'RE NOT SO BUSY,
TO SEE YOUR ORCHARD.

468
00:25:12,734 --> 00:25:15,501
OH. SO YOU DID REMEMBER.

469
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:17,133
YEAH.

470
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,334
WELL, NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE,
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT?

471
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,000
LET'S SEE.

472
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:26,234
IT'S GREAT.
YOU'RE DOING A FINE JOB.

473
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,200
BUT YOU TOOK OFF
QUITE A CHUNK, THOUGH.

474
00:25:28,267 --> 00:25:30,334
OH, I DON'T DO IT
ALL MYSELF.

475
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,133
STILL, 50 ACRES.
THAT'S A LOT FOR A MAN.

476
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
OH, I CAN DO IT.

477
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:35,100
IT'S NOT WORK FOR ME.
IT'S FUN.

478
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,534
AH, PRETTY DIRTY FUN.
OH, MAY I HELP YOU?

479
00:25:37,601 --> 00:25:38,667
NO, I CAN USUALLY MANAGE.

480
00:25:38,734 --> 00:25:39,667
OH, JUST ONCE.

481
00:25:39,734 --> 00:25:40,667
ALL RIGHT.

482
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:42,667
I WANT TO
SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

483
00:25:42,734 --> 00:25:44,601
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO SHOW ME?

484
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,033
SOMETHING I THINK
WILL SAVE YOU

485
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,501
A LOT OF TIME
ON YOUR IRRIGATION.

486
00:25:47,567 --> 00:25:49,934
OH, GOOD.
NOW, WATCH THIS.

487
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,667
NOW WE'LL MAKE A TRENCH
BETWEEN THESE TWO TREES.

488
00:25:52,734 --> 00:25:54,801
A TRENCH, EH?
YEAH, CONNECTING THE TWO.

489
00:25:54,868 --> 00:25:57,167
YOU WORK ON THAT END
AND MAKE IT A LITTLE DEEPER.

490
00:25:57,234 --> 00:25:58,400
DEEPER THAN YOUR END.

491
00:25:58,467 --> 00:25:59,400
IF YOU LIKE.

492
00:25:59,467 --> 00:26:01,400
I SEE.
THAT'S THE WAY.

493
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:02,667
WHAT'S THIS GONNA BE FOR?

494
00:26:02,734 --> 00:26:03,834
I'LL SHOW YOU IN A MINUTE.

495
00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:07,367
YEAH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
NOW, HERE. WATCH THIS.

496
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:11,601
WELL!

497
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:14,000
SEE THAT?

498
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,701
WELL!

499
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:20,734
NOW, YOU CAN DO THAT
RIGHT THROUGH THE ORCHARD.

500
00:26:20,801 --> 00:26:22,968
SEE THE TIME
IT'LL SAVE YOU?

501
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:25,701
WHY, THAT'S PERFECTLY
WONDERFUL!

502
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:26,701
SIMPLE, ISN'T IT?

503
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:27,767
I SHOULD SAY IT IS!

504
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:29,167
NOW WE'LL DO IT OVER HERE.

505
00:26:29,234 --> 00:26:31,834
WHY, NOBODY AROUND HERE
HAS EVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

506
00:26:31,901 --> 00:26:33,734
YOU KNOW,
I ALWAYS PRIDED MYSELF

507
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,534
ON KNOWING
ALL ABOUT ORCHARDS,

508
00:26:35,601 --> 00:26:37,501
BUT I SEE I'VE MUCH MORE
TO LEARN.

509
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:38,701
COME TO THINK OF IT,

510
00:26:38,767 --> 00:26:40,167
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANOTHER ORCHARD
IN CALIFORNIA.

511
00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:41,367
BUT I MUST SAY,

512
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,501
THIS IS THE FINEST FRUIT-GROWING
SOIL I EVER SAW.

513
00:26:43,567 --> 00:26:45,033
I'M SO GLAD
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

514
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,901
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T GET ANYBODY
AT THE HOUSE

515
00:26:46,968 --> 00:26:48,067
TO PAY ANY ATTENTION TO IT.

516
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:49,400
THEY JUST LAUGH.

517
00:26:49,467 --> 00:26:51,400
DON'T YOU WORRY.
YOU'LL HAVE THE LAST LAUGH.

518
00:26:51,467 --> 00:26:54,534
MR. WHITNEY,
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS

519
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:57,234
TO TALK TO SOMEBODY WHO REALLY
UNDERSTANDS AND WHO -

520
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,434
WELL, WHO DOESN'T
MAKE FUN OF YOU.

521
00:26:59,501 --> 00:27:01,100
I SUPPOSE
WHEN YOU FIRST MET ME,

522
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:03,667
YOU THOUGHT ME
AN AWFUL SPRAT.

523
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:06,701
I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE.
OH, I'M SORRY.

524
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:08,701
OH, DON'T WORRY.
I'M USED TO DIRT.

525
00:27:08,767 --> 00:27:11,200
BUT DON'T MEN LIKE WOMEN
WHO HAVE NICE WHITE HANDS?

526
00:27:11,267 --> 00:27:12,400
OH, WOMEN, YES,

527
00:27:12,467 --> 00:27:13,801
BUT IT REALLY ISN'T IMPORTANT,
YOUNGSTER.

528
00:27:13,868 --> 00:27:15,167
I'M NOT A YOUNGSTER.

529
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:17,167
THAT'S RIGHT. I FORGOT.
YOU'RE A GROWN WOMAN.

530
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:22,067
LET'S TRY THE NEXT ONE.

531
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,033
812 SACKS,
ALL FROM THE LOWER 40.

532
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,167
"812"...

533
00:28:11,234 --> 00:28:15,167
BEFORE THE SLICKING HIT HER,
IT WAS AT 1,560.

534
00:28:15,234 --> 00:28:17,501
"1,560."

535
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:18,834
THAT WAS TWO YEARS AGO.

536
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:20,367
WELL,
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?

537
00:28:20,434 --> 00:28:22,067
NOW YOU'VE GOT ME
ALL CONFUSED.

538
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:23,367
WELL,
DID YOU FIND MR. LANCE?

539
00:28:23,434 --> 00:28:24,834
UH, HE'S COMING.

540
00:28:24,901 --> 00:28:25,834
WHERE WAS HE?

541
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:27,234
IN THE BED, SOUND ASLEEP.

542
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,534
GET LOADING,
YOU LAZY IGNORAMUS.

543
00:28:29,601 --> 00:28:30,801
YOU BET YOUR LIFE.

544
00:28:30,868 --> 00:28:32,133
412 SACKS.

545
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,334
"400 AND... "

546
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,734
LANCE!

547
00:28:45,234 --> 00:28:48,334
YOU CALL ME, SIR?

548
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,367
11:00 IN THE MORNING,
AND YOU'RE STILL IN YOUR BED.

549
00:28:52,434 --> 00:28:55,701
HAS BEEN OUT HERE
SINCE BEFORE DAYLIGHT.

550
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,400
YOU KNOW WE'RE SHORT
OF HANDS.

551
00:28:57,467 --> 00:28:59,801
MOST OF THE MEN HAVE GONE
TO WORK IN THE MINES.

552
00:28:59,868 --> 00:29:02,234
HARDLY BLAME THEM
FOR WANTING TO EARN MORE MONEY.

553
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,701
BESIDES, THEY LIKE MINING.

554
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:06,501
THEY'RE PROBABLY AS SICK AS
I AM OF WHEAT FIELDS. LANCE.

555
00:29:06,567 --> 00:29:07,801
THIS IS NOTHING NEW, SIR.

556
00:29:07,868 --> 00:29:09,901
YOU KNOW I NEVER INTEND
TO BE A FARMER.

557
00:29:09,968 --> 00:29:12,234
I'D LIKE TO GET AWAY
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

558
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,234
IF YOU COULD LEND ME $400 OR $500. WHAT?

559
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,234
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE
MONEY, SIR. I'LL PAY YOU BACK.

560
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,968
EVERYBODY'S MAKING MONEY
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

561
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:22,834
SAN FRAN- WELL, SIR,
YOU'VE GOT YOUR NERVE.

562
00:29:22,901 --> 00:29:24,834
WHY, YOU CAN ALMOST PICK UP
MONEY IN THE STREETS THERE.

563
00:29:24,901 --> 00:29:26,033
LOOK AT UNCLE RALPH.

564
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,234
WELL, LOOK AT HIM.

565
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,701
SOLD HIS BIRTHRIGHT FOR A MESS
OF MINE STOCK.

566
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:31,000
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

567
00:29:31,067 --> 00:29:33,467
I WANT TO GO SOMEPLACE
WHERE THERE'S SOME LIFE -

568
00:29:33,534 --> 00:29:35,167
SOME FUTURE FOR ME,
THAT'S ALL.

569
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:36,801
FUTURE?

570
00:29:36,868 --> 00:29:38,567
WHY, MY BOY,
ONE DAY THIS WHOLE RANCH

571
00:29:38,634 --> 00:29:40,067
WILL BE YOURS AND SERENA'S.

572
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:42,501
AND BY THAT TIME,
IT WILL BE UNDER 3 FEET OF MUD.

573
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:44,400
ASK ANYBODY.
ASK JARED.

574
00:29:44,467 --> 00:29:46,267
I'M NOT ASKING
ANY YANKEE MINER

575
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:48,033
TO HELP RUN
MY FAMILY AFFAIRS.

576
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,400
JARED'S MY FRIEND, SIR.

577
00:29:49,467 --> 00:29:50,634
OH.

578
00:29:50,701 --> 00:29:52,467
SO HE'S THE ONE
WHO'S BEEN PUTTING IDEAS

579
00:29:52,534 --> 00:29:53,634
OF SAN FRANCISCO
INTO YOUR HEAD.

580
00:29:53,701 --> 00:29:54,868
IT WAS MY OWN IDEA.

581
00:29:54,934 --> 00:29:56,534
AND IF YOU'D ONLY LEND ME
THE MONEY, I'D -

582
00:29:56,601 --> 00:29:59,133
I'M NOT FINANCING ANY WILD-GOOSE
CHASE TO SAN FRANCISCO. BUT, SIR -

583
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,200
AND THAT, LANCE, IS FINAL.

584
00:30:12,634 --> 00:30:13,734
WHOA.

585
00:30:13,801 --> 00:30:14,868
MORNING, MacKENZIE.

586
00:30:14,934 --> 00:30:17,067
FETCHING TO GET YOURSELF
RUN OVER, CHRIS?

587
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:19,200
OH, I WAS THINKING
OF SOMETHING ELSE.

588
00:30:19,267 --> 00:30:21,868
RECKON WE'RE ALL DOING A LOT
OF THINKING THESE DAYS.

589
00:30:21,934 --> 00:30:24,467
LEASTWAYS THIS YEAR,
YOU'VE GOT A CROP TO HARVEST.

590
00:30:24,534 --> 00:30:27,234
MORE THAN I CAN SAY.
MINE'S FLOODED OUT - 600 ACRES.

591
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,901
YOU'RE NOT
THE ONLY ONE, MAC.

592
00:30:28,968 --> 00:30:31,200
NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW
WHERE IT WILL ALL END.

593
00:30:31,267 --> 00:30:33,601
SOMETHING'S GOT TO BE
DONE MIGHTY SOON, CHRIS.

594
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,334
GIDDAP.

595
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:43,901
NOW, WATCH.

596
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:47,067
IF YOU OPEN THE VALVES TOO FAST,
YOU'LL WRECK THE PIPE.

597
00:31:02,467 --> 00:31:04,734
FASCINATING!

598
00:31:04,801 --> 00:31:06,734
WHAT?!

599
00:31:06,801 --> 00:31:09,100
I SAID IT'S FASCINATING!

600
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,501
I CAN'T HEAR YOU!

601
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:11,901
I DON'T BLAME YOU!

602
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:18,033
HEY! EASE UP
ON THAT PRESSURE A LITTLE!

603
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,234
WHAT IS IT, LANCE?

604
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,534
I'VE FORGOTTEN NOW.

605
00:31:20,601 --> 00:31:22,334
HOW CAN ANYONE THINK
WITH THE ROAR OF THOSE CANNONS

606
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,367
SPLITTING
THEIR EARDRUMS?

607
00:31:23,434 --> 00:31:24,434
ANYWAY, IT'S ACTION.

608
00:31:24,501 --> 00:31:26,100
WELL, IF YOU FEEL SO STRONGLY
ABOUT IT,

609
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:27,434
WHY DON'T YOU DO
SOMETHING?

610
00:31:27,501 --> 00:31:29,367
I AM GONNA DO SOMETHING.
I'M ON MY WAY NOW.

611
00:31:29,434 --> 00:31:30,701
WHERE?
TO SAN FRANCISCO.

612
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:31,801
SAN FRANCISCO?

613
00:31:31,868 --> 00:31:33,400
YES, I WANT TO GET AWAY
FROM HERE.

614
00:31:33,467 --> 00:31:34,767
I'M SICK AND TIRED
OF WHEAT.

615
00:31:34,834 --> 00:31:36,200
YOUR FATHER KNOW
YOU'RE GOING?

616
00:31:36,267 --> 00:31:38,367
NO. HE WOULDN'T STAKE ME.
SO I'M GOING ON MY OWN.

617
00:31:38,434 --> 00:31:39,934
BUT JUST WAIT
TILL I LAND THERE.

618
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,701
YEAH. BE SURE YOU LAND
ON BOTH FEET.

619
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:43,667
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO WHEN YOU GET THERE?

620
00:31:43,734 --> 00:31:44,734
I DON'T KNOW YET.

621
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:46,667
UNCLE RALPH WILL GIVE ME
ALL THE HELP I NEED.

622
00:31:46,734 --> 00:31:49,167
UNLESS ONE OF THE YOUNG
LADIES TAKES YOU AT HAND FIRST.

623
00:31:49,234 --> 00:31:50,367
I KNOW ALL ABOUT WOMEN.

624
00:31:50,434 --> 00:31:52,067
SURE, YOU DO,
AND HORSES, TOO.

625
00:31:52,133 --> 00:31:53,667
ELEPHANT.

626
00:31:53,734 --> 00:31:54,901
THERE'S MY TRAIN.
I GOT TO HURRY.

627
00:31:54,968 --> 00:31:56,467
GOODBYE, FELLA.
GOODBYE.

628
00:31:56,534 --> 00:31:58,367
LOOK ME UP WHEN YOU GET IN TOWN,
WON'T YOU?

629
00:31:58,434 --> 00:32:00,000
FIRST THING.
WHERE WILL I FIND YOU?

630
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:01,334
AT THE POODLE DOG BAR.

631
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,467
YOU KNOW,
ME AND JOHN L. SULLIVAN.

632
00:32:03,534 --> 00:32:04,467
GOODBYE, FELLA!

633
00:32:04,534 --> 00:32:07,667
GOODBYE! GOOD LUCK!

634
00:32:07,734 --> 00:32:11,334
HURRY UP, JOSHUA!
WE GOT TO MAKE THAT TRAIN!

635
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,534
WAIT FOR ME, MR. LANCE.

636
00:32:12,601 --> 00:32:14,634
STEP ON RATHER LIGHT
AND NIP MY HEAD OFF.

637
00:32:14,701 --> 00:32:17,834
WHOA. WHOA.

638
00:32:17,901 --> 00:32:19,834
WAIT FOR ME NOW.
WHOA.

639
00:32:19,901 --> 00:32:22,033
COME ON!
COME ON, JOSHUA!

640
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,033
I'M COMING!

641
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:28,701
DOROTHY! GENE!

642
00:33:52,634 --> 00:33:55,067
WELL, I-I SUPPOSE
I SHOULD BE GETTING ALONG.

643
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,400
I'D ASK YOU TO STAY
FOR DINNER,

644
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,133
BUT FATHER
SEEMS TO BE LATE.

645
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,801
OH, THANKS, BUT I -
RAMON?

646
00:33:59,868 --> 00:34:02,300
RAMON, DIDN'T MY FATHER SAY
WHEN HE'D BE BACK?

647
00:34:02,367 --> 00:34:03,400
NO, MISS SERENA.

648
00:34:03,467 --> 00:34:04,601
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

649
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,234
THEY'LL SAVE ME SOME DINNER
AT THE CAMP.

650
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,567
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.
I HOPE SO.

651
00:34:08,634 --> 00:34:11,601
HERE HE COMES NOW.
DON'T GO.

652
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,868
FATHER, I WAS BEGINNING
TO WORRY ABOUT YOU.

653
00:34:13,934 --> 00:34:15,033
SORRY, SERENA.

654
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,067
GOOD EVENING, SIR.

655
00:34:16,133 --> 00:34:17,601
GOOD EVENING,
MR. WHITNEY.

656
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:19,367
FATHER, WHAT'S HAPPENED?
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

657
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:21,701
I JUST LEFT JOHN MacKENZIE.

658
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:24,634
HIS WIFE AND CHILD
WERE KILLED.

659
00:34:24,701 --> 00:34:26,534
MRS. MacKENZIE?

660
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:29,734
AND GENE?

661
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,901
WHERE? HOW?

662
00:34:31,968 --> 00:34:34,467
THE GROUND WASHED
FROM UNDER THEIR HOUSE,

663
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:35,834
AND THE ROOF CAVED IN.

664
00:34:35,901 --> 00:34:38,534
THEY BROUGHT THE BODIES
INTO TOWN.

665
00:34:40,534 --> 00:34:42,801
WHERE'S LANCE?

666
00:34:42,868 --> 00:34:47,601
FATHER, LANCE ISN'T HERE.
HE'S GONE.

667
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:50,334
GONE? WHERE?

668
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,334
TO SAN FRANCISCO.

669
00:34:56,467 --> 00:35:00,300
DON'T WAIT DINNER FOR ME.
YOU TWO GO AHEAD.

670
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:12,033
AND SO I SUGGEST WE FOLLOW
THIS ORDERLY PROCEDURE.

671
00:35:15,801 --> 00:35:17,801
TALK ALL THE LAW
YOU WANT TO, CHRIS.

672
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:19,868
BUT WHEN YOU SPEND
ALMOST A LIFETIME

673
00:35:19,934 --> 00:35:22,334
OF CLEARING A HOMESTEAD
AND PUTTING IN A CROP

674
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,534
AND THE SLICKINGS SPREADS
DOWN OVER IT,

675
00:35:24,601 --> 00:35:27,200
I TELL YOU, YOU FEEL
ALMOST LIKE KILLING SOMEONE.

676
00:35:28,901 --> 00:35:30,167
LISTEN, MEN!

677
00:35:30,234 --> 00:35:32,334
WE WAIT FOR THE COURTS,
AND WHAT'LL HAPPEN?

678
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,434
NOTHING!
NOTHING! NOTHING!

679
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:35,334
THEY GOT LAWYERS AND MONEY
BEHIND THEM.

680
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,567
THEY'LL KEEP PUTTING US OFF
TWO, THREE YEARS -

681
00:35:37,634 --> 00:35:39,400
THEN WHERE ARE YOU?

682
00:35:39,467 --> 00:35:41,901
JIM, IN THE LONG RUN -

683
00:35:41,968 --> 00:35:43,367
THE DEVIL
WITH THE LONG RUN.

684
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:46,400
I'VE WORKED, SAVED,
PAID MY BILLS REGULAR,

685
00:35:46,467 --> 00:35:49,300
AND I DON'T PROPOSE TO GIVE UP
20 YEARS OF HARD WORK

686
00:35:49,367 --> 00:35:50,601
WITHOUT A FIGHT!

687
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:52,601
THIS IS A MATTER
OF LIFE AND DEATH

688
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:54,300
TO YOU, TO ME,
TO ALL OF US!

689
00:35:55,734 --> 00:35:59,000
I CAN'T STAND ANOTHER
HARVEST LIKE THIS LAST ONE,

690
00:35:59,067 --> 00:36:00,567
AND I DON'T INTEND TO!

691
00:36:00,634 --> 00:36:02,234
WAIT A MINUTE!
WAIT A MINUTE!

692
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,067
I'M A MASSACHUSETTS MAN,
AND I BELIEVE IN LAW AND ORDER.

693
00:36:05,133 --> 00:36:06,801
BUT THE ONLY WAY
WE'LL GET LAW THIS TIME

694
00:36:06,868 --> 00:36:08,467
IS THROUGH THE MUZZLE END
OF A RIFLE.

695
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:10,767
I SAY TAKE A GANG UP THERE
WITH GUNS AND CLEAR THEM OUT!

696
00:36:12,501 --> 00:36:15,000
NOW, WAIT. LISTEN TO ME.

697
00:36:15,067 --> 00:36:17,667
I WANT TO SEE THAT RIFFRAFF
DRIVEN OUT OF HERE

698
00:36:17,734 --> 00:36:19,334
AS MUCH AS ANY MAN AMONG YOU.

699
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,300
BUT KILLING AND MOB RULE
NEVER GOT ANYBODY ANYTHING.

700
00:36:22,367 --> 00:36:25,734
WHATEVER WE'VE LOST NOW
IS NOTHING TO WHAT WE'D LOSE

701
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:28,334
BY TAKING THE LAW
INTO OUR OWN HANDS.

702
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,667
THAT WOULD BE PLAIN SUICIDE.

703
00:36:30,734 --> 00:36:32,734
WHAT -

704
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:34,234
WHAT'S THERE TO CHOOSE

705
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,834
BETWEEN SUICIDE
AND MURDER, CHRIS?

706
00:36:37,901 --> 00:36:41,701
WHAT MORE CAN A MAN LOSE
THAN I HAVE?

707
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:45,367
I'VE SEEN MY WHEAT FLOATING
DOWN THE RIVER,

708
00:36:45,434 --> 00:36:49,801
WATCHED MY CATTLE STARVING
TO DEATH IN A CLOVER PASTURE,

709
00:36:49,868 --> 00:36:51,968
AND MY WELL CHOKED UP
WITH MUD.

710
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:54,033
SO HAVE I, MAC.

711
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,534
I KNOW THAT. WE ALL HAVE.

712
00:36:56,601 --> 00:36:58,567
BUT HAVE YOU SEEN YOUR WIFE
AND BABY

713
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:00,300
KILLED IN FRONT
OF YOUR EYES?

714
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:02,234
HAVE YOU HEARD THEM
SCREAM FOR YOU

715
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,534
AND THEN WATCH THEM
BEING CRUSHED TO DEATH

716
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:07,133
UNDER YOUR OWN ROOF
BEFORE YOU COULD GET TO THEM?

717
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,100
HAVE YOU SEEN THAT?

718
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:11,901
WELL, I HAVE.

719
00:37:11,968 --> 00:37:15,200
AND BEFORE GOD I TELL YOU
I'M GOING TO GET THE MURDERERS

720
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:17,767
WHO DID IT
IF I HAVE TO GO UP THERE ALONE!

721
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:20,100
WE'LL GO WITH YOU, MAC.

722
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:24,167
SILENCE! ALL OF YOU!
SIT DOWN A MINUTE!

723
00:37:28,501 --> 00:37:32,601
IF YOU'RE SET TO DO IT THIS WAY,
GO AHEAD.

724
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,467
BUT BEFORE YOU RUSH UP THERE

725
00:37:34,534 --> 00:37:37,334
AND COVER YOURSELVES
WITH BLOOD AND GLORY,

726
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,167
LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE.

727
00:37:40,234 --> 00:37:43,167
NOW, YOU MAY KNOW ME,
EVERYONE OF YOU.

728
00:37:43,234 --> 00:37:45,601
HAVE I EVER LIED TO YOU
OR ADVISED YOU WRONG?

729
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:47,400
NO. NO, YOU HAVEN'T.

730
00:37:47,467 --> 00:37:49,901
MOST OF US CAME OUT HERE
TOGETHER IN '65.

731
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:53,000
WE FOUGHT AND WORKED TOGETHER
TO MAKE THIS VALLEY A HOME

732
00:37:53,067 --> 00:37:55,067
FOR OURSELVES
AND OUR CHILDREN -

733
00:37:55,133 --> 00:37:56,534
YEARS OF WORK.

734
00:37:56,601 --> 00:37:59,767
EVERYTHING ON EARTH, WE OWNED.

735
00:37:59,834 --> 00:38:02,767
AND NOW YOU WANT TO THROW IT
AWAY IN ONE HOTHEADED HOUR,

736
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:04,300
GET YOURSELF SHOT OR HANGED,

737
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:06,567
JUST AS THE LAW ITSELF
IS GETTING READY

738
00:38:06,634 --> 00:38:07,901
TO DRIVE THE MINERS OUT.

739
00:38:07,968 --> 00:38:09,400
IS THAT COMMON SENSE?

740
00:38:11,801 --> 00:38:14,901
YOU MEN ASKED ME HERE
TO HELP YOU ORGANIZE.

741
00:38:14,968 --> 00:38:18,033
ALL RIGHT, I'LL HELP.

742
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,934
I'LL WORK WITH YOU
ANY WAY YOU DECIDE.

743
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,734
BUT TRY IT MY WAY FIRST.
GIVE THE COURTS A CHANCE.

744
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:27,968
IF THEY TURN US DOWN...

745
00:38:28,033 --> 00:38:30,133
I'LL FIGHT WITH YOU.

746
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,934
I'LL LEAD YOU UP THERE.
I PROMISE YOU THAT.

747
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,934
ALL RIGHT, CHRIS.
WE'LL WAIT.

748
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
IS THAT ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU, MEN?

749
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:52,400
I'M WITH YOU, CHRIS.
AND I HOPE WE'RE RIGHT.

750
00:38:52,467 --> 00:38:56,033
BUT THERE'S A TIME ELEMENT
AGAINST US.

751
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,701
THESE MEN WON'T WAIT LONG.

752
00:38:58,767 --> 00:39:00,367
GOOD NIGHT, CHRIS.

753
00:39:00,434 --> 00:39:02,367
GOOD NIGHT, DOC.

754
00:39:21,133 --> 00:39:22,701
DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING?

755
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:25,601
NO. WHAT'S THE MATTER?
ARE YOU NERVOUS?

756
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:27,300
NO.

757
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:28,868
TIRED?

758
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:30,534
NO, I'M NOT TIRED.

759
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,133
WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING
THE MATTER.

760
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,367
I'M WORRIED ABOUT FATHER.

761
00:39:33,434 --> 00:39:35,167
HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BACK
LONG AGO.

762
00:39:35,234 --> 00:39:37,501
OH, PLEASE DON'T WORRY.
HE'LL BE BACK PRESENTLY.

763
00:39:37,567 --> 00:39:39,000
YOU MUSTN'T UPSET
YOURSELF.

764
00:39:39,067 --> 00:39:41,200
I CAN'T FORGET THE LOOK
ON THOSE MEN'S FACES

765
00:39:41,267 --> 00:39:42,934
WHEN THEY CALLED
FOR HIM TONIGHT.

766
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,033
AH, YES. I REMEMBER.

767
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,868
I SAW SOME OF THEM
COMING OUT OF TOWN.

768
00:39:45,934 --> 00:39:47,534
DID THEY SAY ANYTHING
TO YOU?

769
00:39:47,601 --> 00:39:49,334
WELL, NO, NOT OUT LOUD.

770
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,968
JARED, THEY WERE TALKING
ABOUT THE MINE,

771
00:39:52,033 --> 00:39:55,667
ABOUT GOING UP THERE AND -
AND CLEANING IT OUT.

772
00:39:55,734 --> 00:39:58,968
WELL, IF THEY DO, THEY
BETTER COME UP THERE SHOOTING.

773
00:39:59,033 --> 00:40:02,267
OH, SERENA.
WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR TROUBLE.

774
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:04,567
BUT WE'RE NOT RUNNING AWAY
FROM IT, EITHER.

775
00:40:04,634 --> 00:40:06,501
OH, JARED,
EVERYTHING WAS SO RIGHT

776
00:40:06,567 --> 00:40:08,300
THE OTHER DAY
IN THE ORCHARD -

777
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:10,834
WORKING TOGETHER AND HELPING
THE TREES TO GROW.

778
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:12,467
WHY CAN'T IT STAY
THAT WAY?

779
00:40:12,534 --> 00:40:14,634
I'M AFRAID
THERE'S GOING TO BE TROUBLE.

780
00:40:14,701 --> 00:40:16,634
OH, JARED.

781
00:40:16,701 --> 00:40:18,701
POOR DARLING.

782
00:40:25,267 --> 00:40:26,868
WHOSE HORSE IS THAT,
ENOCH?

783
00:40:26,934 --> 00:40:28,934
IT BELONGS
TO MR. WHITNEY.

784
00:40:38,767 --> 00:40:40,033
PROMISE YOU WON'T WORRY?

785
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,200
I PROMISE.

786
00:40:41,267 --> 00:40:43,868
GOOD NIGHT.

787
00:40:46,968 --> 00:40:48,467
GOOD NIGHT.

788
00:40:58,334 --> 00:40:59,634
GOOD EVENING, MR. FERRIS.

789
00:40:59,701 --> 00:41:01,567
MR. WHITNEY,
I'LL HAVE TO ASK YOU

790
00:41:01,634 --> 00:41:03,701
NOT TO COME HERE
TO BANNOCKBURN AGAIN.

791
00:41:03,767 --> 00:41:05,934
WOULD YOU MIND EXPLAINING JUST WHY, SIR?

792
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,100
IF YOU INSIST.

793
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:09,400
I DON'T CARE FOR YOUR ABUSE
OF MY HOSPITALITY.

794
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,801
AND I DON'T CARE FOR THE USE
YOU'RE MAKING OF IT

795
00:41:11,868 --> 00:41:13,567
TO FURTHER YOUR AIMS
WITH SERENA.

796
00:41:13,634 --> 00:41:14,968
I HOPE MY MEANING IS PLAIN.

797
00:41:15,033 --> 00:41:16,734
IT'S PLAIN ENOUGH,
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

798
00:41:16,801 --> 00:41:19,000
I HAVE THE OPPOSITE
IMPRESSION.

799
00:41:19,067 --> 00:41:21,100
FURTHERMORE, SINCE WE'RE
TALKING PLAIN, I'LL TELL YOU

800
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:23,100
THAT I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE
A FORTUNE-HUNTING MINER

801
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:24,300
HANGING AROUND
MY DAUGHTER.

802
00:41:24,367 --> 00:41:26,033
I'VE SEEN ENOUGH OF YOUR KIND
TO LAST ME.

803
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,734
THERE'LL BE
NO FURTHER ASSOCIATION

804
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:29,701
BETWEEN YOURSELF
AND MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY.

805
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:32,367
MR. FERRIS, I DON'T LIKE
YOUR WORD "FORTUNE HUNTER."

806
00:41:32,434 --> 00:41:34,067
I DIDN'T SAY
WHAT I MIGHT HAVE

807
00:41:34,133 --> 00:41:36,000
BECAUSE I LIKE YOU
AND RESPECT YOU,

808
00:41:36,067 --> 00:41:37,934
AND BECAUSE
YOU'RE SERENA'S FATHER.

809
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,267
BUT I WILL SAY THIS NOW -
I LOVE SERENA.

810
00:41:41,334 --> 00:41:43,200
I LOVE HER, AND I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU THINK.

811
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,767
MR. WHITNEY, I'M GIVING YOU
WARNING TO KEEP AWAY FROM HERE

812
00:41:45,834 --> 00:41:47,200
AND TO KEEP AWAY
FROM SERENA.

813
00:41:47,267 --> 00:41:49,868
YOU CAN KEEP ME FROM SEEING
SERENA - FOR A WHILE.

814
00:41:49,934 --> 00:41:51,634
BUT SHE'LL BE OF AGE
BEFORE LONG,

815
00:41:51,701 --> 00:41:54,467
AND THEN YOU AND THIS WHOLE
VALLEY CAN'T KEEP US APART.

816
00:41:54,534 --> 00:41:56,033
GOOD NIGHT, SIR.

817
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:05,400
71,000.
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH, WHITNEY.

818
00:42:05,467 --> 00:42:06,567
I KNOW
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

819
00:42:06,634 --> 00:42:08,367
AND I'VE BEEN YELLING ABOUT IT
FOR MONTHS.

820
00:42:08,434 --> 00:42:10,067
DON'T ANY OF THAT BUNCH
IN SAN FRANCISCO

821
00:42:10,133 --> 00:42:11,534
EVER READ MY REPORTS?

822
00:42:11,601 --> 00:42:13,100
I DON'T KNOW. THEY DON'T
READ MINE HALF THE TIME.

823
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:14,601
IT SEEMS ALL
THEY WANT TO KNOW IS,

824
00:42:14,667 --> 00:42:16,100
WHY AREN'T YOU
SHIPPING OUT MORE?

825
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:17,234
SURE, I'LL SHIP THEM MORE.

826
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,200
JUST GIVE ME A DECENT
WATER PRESSURE UP HERE,

827
00:42:19,267 --> 00:42:21,234
AND I'LL SEND THEM ENOUGH
TO PUT IN THEIR EARS.

828
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,601
I'M NOT BLAMING YOU. I'M JUST
TELLING YOU WHAT THEY SAY.

829
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:25,334
THE WATER'S HERE
IF THEY'D ONLY LISTEN.

830
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,100
I DRAW OUT A DETAILED PLAN
FOR A NEW DAM

831
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:28,601
IN EVERY REPORT
I SENT UP THERE.

832
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:30,234
WELL, I'LL REMIND THEM,
IF YOU WANT.

833
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,000
NO, YOU WON'T.
I'LL TELL THEM MYSELF.

834
00:42:32,067 --> 00:42:33,968
GOING TO TO SAN FRANCISCO
IN THE MORNING.

835
00:42:34,033 --> 00:42:35,968
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

836
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,934
THAT'S THE PUNCH.

837
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,167
POSITIVE.

838
00:43:47,133 --> 00:43:49,400
NO GREATER MARE IN THE COUNTRY
CAN BEAT HER AT SIX FURLONGS.

839
00:43:49,467 --> 00:43:50,801
YOU'RE CRAZY.

840
00:43:50,868 --> 00:43:52,400
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH
THE STANFORD MARE WALKAWAY?

841
00:43:52,467 --> 00:43:53,601
HASN'T GOT A CHANCE.

842
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:55,534
I'M GETTING 3 TO 1
ON BALDWIN'S BAY GELDING.

843
00:43:55,601 --> 00:43:58,200
BEST TOUR THAT EVER COME
TO OAKLAND - BAR NONE.

844
00:43:58,267 --> 00:43:59,467
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

845
00:43:59,534 --> 00:44:01,634
DOWN IN PANAMA THEY'RE THINKING
OF BUILDING A CANAL

846
00:44:01,701 --> 00:44:03,467
FROM THE ATLANTIC
TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN?

847
00:44:03,534 --> 00:44:05,701
TIMES ARE CHANGING.

848
00:44:19,601 --> 00:44:20,901
JARED.
LANCE!

849
00:44:20,968 --> 00:44:23,501
I TOLD YOU YOU'D FIND ME
AT THE POODLE DOG BAR.

850
00:44:23,567 --> 00:44:25,067
THAT'S RIGHT.
I REMEMBER.

851
00:44:25,133 --> 00:44:27,067
BUT, UH,
WHERE'S JOHN L. SULLIVAN?

852
00:44:27,133 --> 00:44:29,501
HE'S RIGHT OVER THERE
IN THE TOP HAT.

853
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,300
HERE, THIS CALLS
FOR A CELEBRATION.

854
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,868
SIT DOWN. FRANK?
YES, SIR.

855
00:44:32,934 --> 00:44:34,501
WOULD YOU BRING
SOME MORE CHAMPAGNE?

856
00:44:34,567 --> 00:44:36,467
OH, NOT THIS EARLY.
WHY NOT?

857
00:44:36,534 --> 00:44:37,634
GO AHEAD, FRANK.

858
00:44:37,701 --> 00:44:39,801
IN SAN FRANCISCO,
THEY DRINK IT FOR BREAKFAST.

859
00:44:39,868 --> 00:44:41,400
HOW DO YOU LIKE SAN FRANCISCO?

860
00:44:41,467 --> 00:44:43,601
I'VE NEVER HAD SUCH A TIME
IN MY LIFE, JARED.

861
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:45,467
WHY, PEOPLE ARE ROLLING
IN GOLD UP HERE.

862
00:44:45,534 --> 00:44:46,567
IT GROWS ON TREES.

863
00:44:46,634 --> 00:44:47,667
YEAH, I KNOW. I KNOW.

864
00:44:47,734 --> 00:44:49,501
WE HAVE TO SHAKE THE TREES
FOR THEM.

865
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:51,601
BUT HOW ABOUT YOU?
ARE YOU UP ON BUSINESS?

866
00:44:51,667 --> 00:44:53,033
YES, I CAME UP
TO SEE MY BOSS.

867
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,000
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO LOCATE
HIM FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS.

868
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,067
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

869
00:44:56,133 --> 00:44:57,901
HARRISON McCOOEY.
EVER HEAR OF HIM?

870
00:44:57,968 --> 00:44:59,567
HARRISON McCOOEY?

871
00:44:59,634 --> 00:45:01,734
AND YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR HIM
FOR THREE DAYS?

872
00:45:01,801 --> 00:45:03,901
OH, YOU KNOW HIM?

873
00:45:03,968 --> 00:45:06,434
DO I KNOW HIM?

874
00:45:09,767 --> 00:45:11,167
OH, HERE THEY COME NOW.

875
00:45:13,234 --> 00:45:17,601
I THOUGHT YOU GIRLS
WOULD NEVER COME BACK.

876
00:45:17,667 --> 00:45:19,334
LANA CRABTREE,
AND SHE'S EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL

877
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,667
OFF THAN SHE IS -

878
00:45:20,734 --> 00:45:22,067
OH.

879
00:45:22,133 --> 00:45:24,367
ROSANNE, THIS IS JARED WHITNEY.
I JUST STUMBLED INTO HIM.

880
00:45:24,434 --> 00:45:25,534
PLEASURE, MA'AM.

881
00:45:25,601 --> 00:45:27,133
NOT THE JARED WHITNEY?

882
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,868
LANCE HAS SPOKEN OF YOU
SO OFTEN.

883
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,901
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SORT OF
A HERO TO HIM.

884
00:45:30,968 --> 00:45:32,901
OH, WELL.
WE'RE OLD FRIENDS.

885
00:45:32,968 --> 00:45:35,033
OH MOLLY, DARLING,
I'M SO SORRY.

886
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,434
MR. WHITNEY, MAY I PRESENT
MISS MOLLY FEATHERSTONE?

887
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:38,434
DELIGHTED.

888
00:45:38,501 --> 00:45:39,868
HOW DO YOU DO?

889
00:45:39,934 --> 00:45:41,200
COME ON, GIRLS.
LET'S SIT DOWN.

890
00:45:41,267 --> 00:45:43,234
JARED'S BEEN IN TOWN THREE DAYS
LOOKING FOR HIS BOSS.

891
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,367
HE'S BEEN SITTING IN HIS OFFICE
FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT,

892
00:45:45,434 --> 00:45:46,567
WAITING FOR HIM
TO COME IN.

893
00:45:46,634 --> 00:45:48,601
WHY, WHO DO YOU THINK
HIS BOSS IS?

894
00:45:48,667 --> 00:45:49,734
I GIVE UP.
WHO?

895
00:45:49,801 --> 00:45:51,601
THE HONORABLE
HARRISON McCOOEY.

896
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:53,133
YES, HE'S MY BOSS,
ALL RIGHT.

897
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,767
I USED TO THINK
HE WAS MINE, TOO.

898
00:45:54,834 --> 00:45:56,901
WHAT? HE'S AUNT ROSANNE'S FATHER.

899
00:45:56,968 --> 00:45:58,300
OH, NOW, I -

900
00:45:58,367 --> 00:45:59,834
BUT YOU'VE COME
TO THE RIGHT PLACE

901
00:45:59,901 --> 00:46:01,133
TO FIND HIM, MR. WHITNEY.

902
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,968
HARRY'S ONE OF THE ORIGINAL
FIXTURES AT THIS BAR.

903
00:46:03,033 --> 00:46:04,133
ISN'T HE, DARLING?

904
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,133
YES.

905
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,334
FATHER'S ON HIS WAY
HERE NOW.

906
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,601
WE'RE ALL DRIVING
TO THE RACES.

907
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:08,901
WHY DON'T YOU COME ALONG
WITH US?

908
00:46:08,968 --> 00:46:10,067
OH, THANKS VERY MUCH,
BUT -

909
00:46:10,133 --> 00:46:11,067
OH, SURE YOU CAN,
JARED.

910
00:46:11,133 --> 00:46:12,200
THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM
FOR US ALL.

911
00:46:12,267 --> 00:46:13,467
WELL, PERHAPS MR. McCOOEY

912
00:46:13,534 --> 00:46:14,934
WOULDN'T LIKE TO MIX
BUSINESS WITH PLEASURE.

913
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,334
THAT'S THE WAY EVERYTHING'S DONE
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

914
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,567
WHOA.

915
00:46:29,968 --> 00:46:32,501
EXACTLY 7 MINUTES FROM THE TOP
OF NOB HILL.

916
00:46:32,567 --> 00:46:34,300
SOME FOOL LUCK
WE GOT HERE AT ALL.

917
00:46:34,367 --> 00:46:36,100
I THINK THAT DESERVES
A DRINK, EH?

918
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:38,601
DON'T YOU THINK ONE IS ENOUGH
AFTER THAT WILD RIDE?

919
00:46:46,467 --> 00:46:48,067
THREE OF MY SPECIAL.

920
00:46:48,133 --> 00:46:50,133
ALL RIGHT, MR. McCOOEY.

921
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,133
OH, HERE'S FATHER NOW.

922
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,167
HI, BOYS.

923
00:46:53,234 --> 00:46:54,334
BETTING ON YOUR HORSE TODAY,
HARRISON.

924
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,901
YOU CAN'T LOSE.

925
00:46:55,968 --> 00:46:57,834
HELLO, GIRLS.
YOU ALL READY?

926
00:46:57,901 --> 00:46:59,334
HELLO, MOLLY.
YOU LOOK LOVELY.

927
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,734
FATHER,
THIS IS JARED WHITNEY.

928
00:47:00,801 --> 00:47:02,067
HE'S AN OLD FRIEND
OF LANCE'S.

929
00:47:02,133 --> 00:47:04,100
HOW DO YOU DO, SIR? HOW
ARE YOU, MR. McCOOEY?

930
00:47:04,167 --> 00:47:06,300
MR. WHITNEY'S BEEN LOOKING
FOR YOU FOR DAYS, FATHER.

931
00:47:06,367 --> 00:47:07,767
NOT LOOKING FOR A JOB,
ARE YOU?

932
00:47:07,834 --> 00:47:09,400
HE'S ALREADY
WORKING FOR YOU.

933
00:47:09,467 --> 00:47:10,634
WORKING FOR ME?
WHERE?

934
00:47:10,701 --> 00:47:12,234
GOLDEN MOON MINE, SIR.
I'M IN CHARGE THERE.

935
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,868
WHITNEY?
OH, OF COURSE. TO BE SURE.

936
00:47:14,934 --> 00:47:16,367
ANYTHING WRONG
AT THE MINE?

937
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:17,968
SOMEBODY DOWN HERE
SEEMS TO THINK SO.

938
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:19,200
I CAN GUESS WHO IT IS.

939
00:47:19,267 --> 00:47:20,834
COME ALONG, DARLING.
WE DON'T WANT TO BE LATE.

940
00:47:20,901 --> 00:47:22,734
MR. CROCKER GAVE ME A TIP
FOR THE FIRST RACE.

941
00:47:22,801 --> 00:47:25,033
MR. WHITNEY, I WANT YOU
TO MEET MY PARTNERS -

942
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,300
FRANK CROUCH, MAJOR WALSH.

943
00:47:26,367 --> 00:47:27,667
HOW DO YOU DO, SIR?

944
00:47:27,734 --> 00:47:29,767
MR. WHITNEY IS SUPERINTENDENT
OF OUR GOLDEN MOON MINE.

945
00:47:29,834 --> 00:47:30,801
OH, IS THAT SO?

946
00:47:30,868 --> 00:47:33,267
AH, THE LIFESAVER.

947
00:47:33,334 --> 00:47:35,701
WHITNEY, YOU'LL HAVE TO GRIND
YOUR AX WITH CROUCH HERE.

948
00:47:35,767 --> 00:47:37,234
HE'S THE ATTORNEY
FOR THE FIRM.

949
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,801
BEST LAWYER WEST
OF THE ROCKIES.

950
00:47:38,868 --> 00:47:40,167
HADN'T WE BETTER
GET STARTED, FATHER?

951
00:47:40,234 --> 00:47:41,267
THE RACES BEGIN SOON.

952
00:47:41,334 --> 00:47:42,934
DRIVE YOU THERE
IN A HALF AN HOUR.

953
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,133
I GUARANTEE IT.

954
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,067
YOU KEEP YOUR EYE
OFF HIM, MOLLY.

955
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:52,300
OH, YOU'RE GONNA
BE SELFISH ABOUT IT?

956
00:47:52,367 --> 00:47:53,567
COME ON.
I'LL PROVE IT.

957
00:47:53,634 --> 00:47:55,834
MR. McCOOEY, REALLY, I HAVE
A LOT TO DO THIS AFTERNOON.

958
00:47:55,901 --> 00:47:57,534
YOU'RE GOING WITH US.
OH, NO, THANK YOU.

959
00:47:57,601 --> 00:47:59,067
OH, SURE YOU ARE.
WE SETTLED THAT.

960
00:47:59,133 --> 00:48:00,400
WHY, OF COURSE
YOU'RE COMING.

961
00:48:00,467 --> 00:48:02,467
BUT, MR. McCOOEY, I CAME HERE
TO TALK BUSINESS WITH YOU.

962
00:48:02,534 --> 00:48:04,400
OH, LET BUSINESS WAIT
FOR THE OFFICE TOMORROW.

963
00:48:04,467 --> 00:48:06,100
COME ON, BOYS,
I GOT THE GREATEST HUNCH

964
00:48:06,167 --> 00:48:07,567
ON THE THIRD RACE
YOU EVER SAW.

965
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:09,501
MRS. FERRIS, I'VE WORKED
FOR YOUR FATHER FOR A YEAR,

966
00:48:09,567 --> 00:48:11,200
BUT NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY
OF MEETING HIM.

967
00:48:11,267 --> 00:48:12,367
THEY SAID HE WAS HARD
TO REACH.

968
00:48:12,434 --> 00:48:13,501
OH, WELL, THAT'S ABSURD.

969
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,968
WE'RE THE FRIENDLIEST FAMILY
IN THE WORLD.

970
00:48:16,434 --> 00:48:19,033
OUR WATER SUPPLY
COMES FROM THE MOUNTAINS,

971
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,968
DOWN THESE RAVINES,
THROUGH THIS NATURAL BASIN,

972
00:48:22,033 --> 00:48:24,868
ALONG ABOUT 3,000 FEET
TO OUR DAM.

973
00:48:24,934 --> 00:48:28,367
HERE AT THE NECK OF THE BASIN,
THE OPENING IS 360 FEET.

974
00:48:28,434 --> 00:48:29,968
NOW, IF YOU THROW A DAM
ACROSS HERE,

975
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:31,133
YOU'LL HAVE A RESERVOIR

976
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,801
CAPABLE OF HOLDING
3 OR 4 MILLION GALLONS.

977
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,534
SOUNDS ALL RIGHT
THE WAY YOU TELL IT,

978
00:48:34,601 --> 00:48:36,367
BUT HOW MUCH WOULD A DAM
LIKE THAT COST?

979
00:48:36,434 --> 00:48:37,968
ROUGHLY A QUARTER
MILLION DOLLARS.

980
00:48:38,033 --> 00:48:39,467
IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION.

981
00:48:39,534 --> 00:48:42,501
THE GOLDEN MOON WOULD NEVER
BE ABLE TO WORK IT OFF.

982
00:48:42,567 --> 00:48:43,667
WHY NOT, MR. FERRIS?

983
00:48:43,734 --> 00:48:45,133
THE INSPIRATION AND SUNSET

984
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,334
GET THEIR WATER
FROM THE SAME SOURCE.

985
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,601
AND IF YOU CONSOLIDATE
THE THREE MINES,

986
00:48:49,667 --> 00:48:50,968
YOU BUILD YOUR DAM,

987
00:48:51,033 --> 00:48:52,868
YOU CAN OPERATE WINTER
AND SUMMER, 24 HOURS A DAY.

988
00:48:52,934 --> 00:48:55,901
YOU SAY THE INSPIRATION
AND THE SUNSET BOTH USE WATER

989
00:48:55,968 --> 00:48:57,267
FROM THE SAME SOURCE
WE DO?

990
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:58,534
THAT'S RIGHT.

991
00:48:58,601 --> 00:49:00,434
WHERE'S OUR PRESENT RESERVOIR? HERE.

992
00:49:00,501 --> 00:49:02,167
I THINK THE IDEA'S
MIGHTY SMART.

993
00:49:02,234 --> 00:49:04,367
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME
IF WE CAN CONSOLIDATE.

994
00:49:04,434 --> 00:49:06,300
IF IT'S GOOD,
WE CAN WORK IT OUT.

995
00:49:06,367 --> 00:49:08,367
WHITNEY, I'M THINKING
YOU'VE BEEN WASTED

996
00:49:08,434 --> 00:49:09,467
OUT THERE IN THE FIELD.

997
00:49:09,534 --> 00:49:11,400
YOU BELONG RIGHT HERE
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

998
00:49:11,467 --> 00:49:13,067
WE'LL FURNISH YOU
WITH AN OFFICE

999
00:49:13,133 --> 00:49:14,734
AND A REASONABLE
EXPENSE ACCOUNT.

1000
00:49:14,801 --> 00:49:16,634
WE NEED BRIGHT FELLOWS
WITH GOOD IDEAS.

1001
00:49:16,701 --> 00:49:18,434
GENTLEMEN,
THE MEETING'S ADJOURNED.

1002
00:49:18,501 --> 00:49:20,067
LET'S ALL GO DOWN
TO THE EXCHANGE

1003
00:49:20,133 --> 00:49:21,634
AND HAVE A DRINK ON IT.

1004
00:49:21,701 --> 00:49:24,834
THE PLAN TO CONSOLIDATE'S
THE BEST THING I'VE HEARD.

1005
00:49:24,901 --> 00:49:26,000
THAT'S A GREAT
SUGGESTION.

1006
00:49:26,067 --> 00:49:27,300
SURE, WE BUILD A DAM

1007
00:49:27,367 --> 00:49:29,133
AND SHUT THOSE OTHER TWO MINES
OFF FROM THE WATER.

1008
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,467
THEN THEY'LL HAVE TO SELL.

1009
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:32,200
WHY DIDN'T WE THINK
OF THAT OURSELVES?

1010
00:49:32,267 --> 00:49:33,434
WE'RE NOT ENGINEERS.

1011
00:49:33,501 --> 00:49:35,167
OH, DON'T MENTION
THIS SQUEEZE-OUT TO WHITNEY.

1012
00:49:35,234 --> 00:49:37,534
HE MIGHTN'T UNDERSTAND
MODERN BUSINESS METHODS

1013
00:49:37,601 --> 00:49:38,701
ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE.

1014
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,400
WILL YOU GET THIS OFF
ON THE NIGHT TRAIN IF POSSIBLE?

1015
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:48,067
YES, SIR.
I'LL TAKE IT DOWN MYSELF.

1016
00:49:48,133 --> 00:49:51,067
THANK YOU.

1017
00:49:56,434 --> 00:49:59,534
I WISH I COULD HELP YOU, MA'AM,
BUT MR. WHITNEY'S GONE.

1018
00:49:59,601 --> 00:50:00,701
HE'S GONE?

1019
00:50:00,767 --> 00:50:02,868
LEFT - QUICKER THAN THAT.
SAN FRANCISCO, I THINK.

1020
00:50:02,934 --> 00:50:04,634
ALTHOUGH HE DIDN'T
TELL ME.

1021
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:07,434
YOU KNOW, HE ALWAYS
WAS KIND OF CLOSEMOUTHED.

1022
00:50:07,501 --> 00:50:09,934
I NEVER DID HAVE MUCH LUCK
GETTING HIM TO TALK.

1023
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,934
WELL, UH, HOW LONG AGO
DID HE LEAVE?

1024
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,267
OH, TWO OR THREE WEEKS AGO,
MAYBE MORE, MAYBE LESS.

1025
00:50:16,334 --> 00:50:18,767
YOU KNOW, THE DAYS, THEY START
TO ROLL INTO ONE ANOTHER,

1026
00:50:18,834 --> 00:50:20,634
AND THEY - THEY GET ME
ALL MIXED UP.

1027
00:50:20,701 --> 00:50:24,067
WELL, UH, THANK YOU.

1028
00:50:24,133 --> 00:50:26,634
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
NOT AT ALL.

1029
00:50:52,367 --> 00:50:53,067
HELLO, SERENA.

1030
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,534
OH, FATHER.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE HERE.

1031
00:50:57,601 --> 00:50:59,801
WELL, I WAS JUST CLEARING UP
A LITTLE BUSINESS.

1032
00:50:59,868 --> 00:51:01,133
IT'S NEARLY DINNERTIME.

1033
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,567
I'D ALMOST FORGOTTEN.

1034
00:51:03,634 --> 00:51:05,234
WHAT'S THE TROUBLE, HONEY?

1035
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,701
OH, NOTHING, FATHER.
NOTHING AT ALL.

1036
00:51:07,767 --> 00:51:10,868
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.
I KNOW.

1037
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:13,701
IT'S THIS WHITNEY FELLOW,
ISN'T IT?

1038
00:51:13,767 --> 00:51:16,200
YOU PROBABLY FOUND OUT
HE'S GONE AWAY.

1039
00:51:16,267 --> 00:51:18,868
DIDN'T YOU?

1040
00:51:18,934 --> 00:51:20,701
YES.

1041
00:51:20,767 --> 00:51:22,767
HE MIGHT AT LEAST
HAVE SAID GOODBYE.

1042
00:51:22,834 --> 00:51:24,901
OH, WELL,
YOU KNOW THESE MINING MEN -

1043
00:51:24,968 --> 00:51:26,767
HERE TODAY
AND GONE TOMORROW.

1044
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:29,234
YOU CAN'T DEPEND MUCH
ON ANY ONE OF THEM.

1045
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,734
SIT DOWN, SERENA.

1046
00:51:31,801 --> 00:51:34,701
NOW, MY DEAR, I KNOW HOW
EMBARRASSING IT IS FOR YOU

1047
00:51:34,767 --> 00:51:36,601
TO DISCUSS THIS MATTER.

1048
00:51:36,667 --> 00:51:39,767
WELL, IT'S EQUALLY AWKWARD
FOR ME.

1049
00:51:39,834 --> 00:51:42,767
I'D FAR SOONER HAVE YOU TALK
ABOUT THIS IDEA OF YOURS

1050
00:51:42,834 --> 00:51:45,667
OF GROWING FRUIT IN CALIFORNIA.

1051
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,701
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU CARED SO MUCH
FOR THE FELLOW.

1052
00:51:50,767 --> 00:51:55,467
SERENA, YOU CAN'T BE IN LOVE
WITH A YANKEE MINE-MUCKER.

1053
00:51:55,534 --> 00:51:57,133
I AM.

1054
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,167
BUT IT'S RIDICULOUS!

1055
00:52:01,501 --> 00:52:02,901
WELL, IN THE FIRST PLACE,

1056
00:52:02,968 --> 00:52:04,968
YOU'RE NOTHING
BUT A LITTLE GIRL.

1057
00:52:05,033 --> 00:52:07,634
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
BEING IN LOVE ANYWAY?

1058
00:52:07,701 --> 00:52:10,067
LISTEN, HONEY.
I KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU.

1059
00:52:10,133 --> 00:52:12,434
I COULDN'T HAVE A MINING MAN
IN THE -

1060
00:52:14,868 --> 00:52:17,400
YOU SENT HIM AWAY.

1061
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,868
HOW COULD I HAVE SENT HIM AWAY?

1062
00:52:19,934 --> 00:52:22,434
THE MAN'S A FREE AGENT,
ISN'T HE?

1063
00:52:22,501 --> 00:52:24,601
WELL, THEN,
WHAT DID YOU MEAN?

1064
00:52:24,667 --> 00:52:27,801
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN AS MUCH OF LIFE
AS I HAVE, MY DEAR,

1065
00:52:27,868 --> 00:52:29,267
OR OF MEN LIKE WHITNEY.

1066
00:52:29,334 --> 00:52:30,634
YOU'LL GET OVER THIS.

1067
00:52:30,701 --> 00:52:32,567
FATHER, I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED,

1068
00:52:32,634 --> 00:52:34,100
WHAT MADE HIM GO
LIKE THAT!

1069
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:36,400
WELL, I SORT OF
TRADED WITH HIM.

1070
00:52:36,467 --> 00:52:37,434
TRADED?

1071
00:52:37,501 --> 00:52:39,067
FOR HIM TO GET OUT
AND TO STAY OUT.

1072
00:52:39,133 --> 00:52:41,901
HE WOULDN'T DO A THING
LIKE THAT.

1073
00:52:41,968 --> 00:52:44,400
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

1074
00:52:44,467 --> 00:52:47,968
SERENA, I WANT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND -

1075
00:52:48,033 --> 00:52:51,734
DINNER, SIR.
MR. FERRIS.

1076
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:55,133
YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, FATHER.

1077
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,234
SELL 700 SUNSET.

1078
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,734
YES, SIR.

1079
00:53:47,801 --> 00:53:49,934
BUY THE SHARE OF GOLDEN MOON
THAT'S OFFERED. ALL RIGHT.

1080

LITTLE ROOM.

1094
00:55:09,501 --> 00:55:10,901
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

1095
00:55:10,968 --> 00:55:12,868
WE WEREN'T EXPECTING YOU, AND
WE'RE REALLY QUITE CROWDED -

1096
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:14,634
WHAT? - WITH LANCE AND -
MOY, YOU MAY GO.

1097
00:55:14,701 --> 00:55:16,667
I'LL TAKE CARE OF MISS
SERENA. YES, MA'AM.

1098
00:55:16,734 --> 00:55:17,968
OH, AND BRING HER
A COOL DRINK.

1099
00:55:18,033 --> 00:55:19,868
SHE MUST BE VERY FATIGUED
AFTER HER LONG JOURNEY.

1100
00:55:19,934 --> 00:55:21,300
YES, MA'AM.

1101
00:55:21,367 --> 00:55:23,701
MY DEAR, WHEREVER DID
YOU GET ALL THESE DRESSES?

1102
00:55:23,767 --> 00:55:25,567
OH, I HAD THEM MADE
IN TENSPOT. WHY?

1103
00:55:25,634 --> 00:55:27,801
WELL, THEY'RE RATHER PRETTY
FOR THE COUNTRY,

1104
00:55:27,868 --> 00:55:30,634
BUT THEY'RE NOT QUITE WHAT
WE'RE WEARING IN TOWN THIS YEAR.

1105
00:55:30,701 --> 00:55:31,934
OH.

1106
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,634
YES. YES,
THAT'S RATHER PRETTY.

1107
00:55:33,701 --> 00:55:35,501
BUT, UH, I THINK
WE CAN IMPROVE IT.

1108
00:55:35,567 --> 00:55:37,767
OH, AUNT ROSANNE, I HOPE
I'M NOT INCONVENIENCING YOU.

1109
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,901
I SHOULD HAVE LET YOU KNOW
I WAS COMING OF COURSE,

1110
00:55:39,968 --> 00:55:41,801
BUT I-I DIDN'T DECIDE
TILL THE LAST MINUTE.

1111
00:55:41,868 --> 00:55:43,534
MY DEAR,
WE LOVE HAVING YOU.

1112
00:55:43,601 --> 00:55:45,300
OH, THANK YOU,
AUNT ROSANNE.

1113
00:55:45,367 --> 00:55:47,834
I REALLY CAME BECAUSE -
WELL, FOR ONE THING,

1114
00:55:47,901 --> 00:55:50,467
I WANTED TO TALK
TO UNCLE RALPH ABOUT FATHER.

1115
00:55:50,534 --> 00:55:52,133
YOU'LL PROBABLY SEE HIM
ON THURSDAY NIGHT.

1116
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,367
WE'RE ENTERTAINING IN HONOR
OF GENERAL GRANT.

1117
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:55,634
OH, THAT REMINDS ME.

1118
00:55:55,701 --> 00:55:57,467
WE MUST DO SOMETHING
ABOUT FINDING AN ESCORT FOR YOU.

1119
00:55:57,534 --> 00:55:59,100
LET ME SEE -
THERE'S THE POPE BOY -

1120
00:55:59,167 --> 00:56:00,767
PLEASE DON'T BOTHER,
AUNT ROSANNE.

1121
00:56:00,834 --> 00:56:02,234
I DON'T NEED ANYBODY,
REALLY.

1122
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,367
MY DEAR, YOU CAN'T GO RUNNING
AROUND TOWN ALONE.

1123
00:56:04,434 --> 00:56:05,801
THIS ISN'T TENSPOT,
YOU KNOW.

1124
00:56:05,868 --> 00:56:07,968
AND, SERENA, DEAR,
YOU'RE NOT A CHILD ANY LONGER.

1125
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:11,167
FORGIVE ME.

1126
00:56:14,167 --> 00:56:15,934
MORNING, WONG.

1127
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,100
GOOD MORNING,
MR. WHITNEY.

1128
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:20,434
HELLO, JARED.

1129
00:56:20,501 --> 00:56:23,434
HELLO, THERE.

1130
00:56:23,501 --> 00:56:25,601
FLOWERS AGAIN.

1131
00:56:25,667 --> 00:56:28,234
JARED, DIDN'T I TELL YOU
YOU WEREN'T TO DO THIS ANYMORE?

1132
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,901
OH, THEY'RE LOVELY.
HOW SWEET OF YOU.

1133
00:56:30,968 --> 00:56:32,901
OH!
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

1134
00:56:40,701 --> 00:56:44,133
SERENA, COME DOWN,
DARLING.

1135
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,767
YOU KNOW JARED WHITNEY,
DON'T YOU?

1136
00:56:45,834 --> 00:56:46,934
OF COURSE YOU DO.

1137
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,901
LANCE TOLD ME HOW YOU TEASED HER
ABOUT THE APPLES.

1138
00:56:48,968 --> 00:56:51,434
THEY WERE APPLES, WEREN'T THEY,
DARLING? I CAN NEVER REMEMBER.

1139
00:56:51,501 --> 00:56:54,267
SERENA, I HAD NO IDEA.
WHEN DID YOU GET HERE?

1140
00:56:54,334 --> 00:56:55,367
JUST AN HOUR AGO.

1141
00:56:55,434 --> 00:56:56,901
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
SHE WAS HERE?

1142
00:56:56,968 --> 00:56:58,734
I- I DIDN'T REMEMBER
THAT YOU KNEW EACH OTHER.

1143
00:56:58,801 --> 00:57:01,067
OH, AREN'T THEY RAVISHING?
HE JUST SPOILS ME TO DEATH.

1144
00:57:01,133 --> 00:57:04,300
DARLING, TELL HIM HOW NICE HE IS
WHILE I PUT THEM IN WATER.

1145
00:57:04,367 --> 00:57:06,667
SERENA, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU WERE COMING?

1146
00:57:06,734 --> 00:57:08,501
I WOULD HAVE MET YOU
AT THE TRAIN.

1147
00:57:08,567 --> 00:57:09,968
I DIDN'T KNOW.

1148
00:57:10,033 --> 00:57:12,534
WELL, I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW HAPPY
I AM THAT YOU'RE HERE.

1149
00:57:12,601 --> 00:57:14,868
THERE'S SO MUCH TO ASK YOU
AND TO TELL YOU AND -

1150
00:57:14,934 --> 00:57:16,534
WELL, IT'S -
IT'S BEEN SO LONG.

1151
00:57:16,601 --> 00:57:18,000
JARED?

1152
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:20,400
HAVE WONG OPEN A BOTTLE
OF CHAMPAGNE, WILL YOU?

1153
00:57:20,467 --> 00:57:22,767
Listen, Serena, I've simply
got to see you alone.

1154
00:57:22,834 --> 00:57:23,934
But Aunt Rosanne.

1155
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,834
Never mind Aunt Rosanne.
Let's get out of here.

1156
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,167
JARED?

1157
00:57:27,234 --> 00:57:29,200
Hurry up! Quick!

1158
00:57:29,267 --> 00:57:35,267
JARED?

1159
00:57:44,834 --> 00:57:46,801
IT'S A DIFFERENT LIFE,
SERENA,

1160
00:57:46,868 --> 00:57:49,567
BUT IT'S FUN AND CRAMMED
FULL OF EXCITEMENT.

1161
00:57:49,634 --> 00:57:52,100
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I SOMETIMES MISS THE MINE

1162
00:57:52,167 --> 00:57:54,767
AND THE REAL WORK
OF GETTING THE GOLD OUT.

1163
00:57:54,834 --> 00:57:56,267
I'VE MISSED YOU,
TOO, SERENA.

1164
00:57:56,334 --> 00:57:59,634
HAVE YOU, JARED?
ARE YOU SURE?

1165
00:57:59,701 --> 00:58:01,067
WHY DO YOU ASK THAT?

1166
00:58:01,133 --> 00:58:02,968
BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT HAPPENED,

1167
00:58:03,033 --> 00:58:05,067
WHY YOU LEFT
WITHOUT A WORD.

1168
00:58:05,133 --> 00:58:06,434
I WANTED TO SEE YOU.

1169
00:58:06,501 --> 00:58:08,968
I TRIED, BUT I COULDN'T.
IT WASN'T ALLOWED.

1170
00:58:09,033 --> 00:58:10,901
YOU SEE,
IT'S HARD TO SAY. I -

1171
00:58:10,968 --> 00:58:12,767
I UNDERSTAND.

1172
00:58:12,834 --> 00:58:15,133
BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE EXPLAINED.
YOU COULD HAVE WRITTEN.

1173
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,767
BUT I DID.
DIDN'T YOU GET MY LETTERS?

1174
00:58:17,834 --> 00:58:19,434
NO.

1175
00:58:19,501 --> 00:58:20,534
OH.

1176
00:58:20,601 --> 00:58:22,767
WELL,
IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW.

1177
00:58:22,834 --> 00:58:26,300
SERENA, EVER SINCE OUR LAST
NIGHT AT BANNOCKBURN,

1178
00:58:26,367 --> 00:58:30,400
I FOUND OUT SOMETHING I
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN LONG BEFORE.

1179
00:58:30,467 --> 00:58:32,234
I LOVE YOU.

1180
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,234
I'VE KNOWN IT
FOR A LONG TIME.

1181
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,968
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS,
ISN'T IT?

1182
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:00,767
MR. AND MRS. PAUL.

1183
00:59:04,567 --> 00:59:07,701
MR. AND MRS. HUNTINGTON.

1184
00:59:11,434 --> 00:59:14,067
MR. AND MRS DRUCKER.

1185
00:59:25,367 --> 00:59:27,567
THESE WOMEN
OF THE BLACK TROUPE COMPANY

1186
00:59:27,634 --> 00:59:28,934
ARE UTTERLY SHAMELESS.

1187
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,267
THEY ACTUALLY WEAR TIGHTS -
THEY'RE SO REVEALING.

1188
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:33,200
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THESE NEW INVENTIONS.

1189
00:59:33,267 --> 00:59:35,801
A FELLOW BY THE NAME OF BELL
CALLS THE THING A TELEPHONE.

1190
00:59:41,467 --> 00:59:44,434
THE HONORABLE
GEORGE HEARST.

1191
00:59:48,267 --> 00:59:50,367
SENATOR HEARST,
WE'RE DELIGHTED.

1192
00:59:50,434 --> 00:59:53,601
MRS. FERRIS, YOU'RE JUST
AS CHARMING TONIGHT AS EVER.

1193
00:59:53,667 --> 00:59:55,434
YOU'RE SUCH A FLATTERER,
SENATOR.

1194
00:59:55,534 --> 00:59:57,000
GEORGE,
GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

1195
01:00:16,968 --> 01:00:18,300
JARED?

1196
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:27,000
JARED, I'VE BEEN SEARCHING
EVERYWHERE FOR YOU.

1197
01:00:27,067 --> 01:00:30,234
COME ALONG. I HAVE SOME
IMPORTANT PEOPLE YOU SHOULD MEET.

1198
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:32,968
SENATOR HEARST,
MAY I PRESENT MR. WHITNEY?

1199
01:00:33,033 --> 01:00:34,601
HOW DO YOU DO?
SENATOR.

1200
01:00:34,667 --> 01:00:37,234
MR. WHITNEY'S IN CHARGE
OF OUR NEW MINE AT TENSPOT.

1201
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,501
OH, REALLY? I HEAR YOU'VE HIT
A RICH FIELD UP THERE.

1202
01:00:40,567 --> 01:00:41,934
WE THINK SO, SIR.

1203
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,834
WELL, WHEN YOU FIND ANYTHING YOU
THINK'S GOLD, THROW IT AWAY.

1204
01:00:45,901 --> 01:00:48,300
WHEN YOU FIND GOLD,
YOU'LL KNOW IT.

1205
01:00:49,667 --> 01:00:51,868
EXCUSE US.
CERTAINLY.

1206
01:00:51,934 --> 01:00:53,701
HOW'S ALL THE FAMILY,
GEORGE?

1207
01:00:53,767 --> 01:00:55,267
OH, FINE, FINE.

1208
01:00:55,334 --> 01:00:56,367
ONLY I'M A LITTLE WORRIED

1209
01:00:56,434 --> 01:00:57,901
ABOUT THAT BOY OF MINE -
WILLIE.

1210
01:00:57,968 --> 01:00:59,534
HE'S GOT AN IDEA
THAT HE WANTS TO GO

1211
01:00:59,601 --> 01:01:00,901
INTO THE NEWSPAPER
BUSINESS.

1212
01:01:00,968 --> 01:01:02,400
HE WANTS US TO BUY
THE EXAMINER.

1213
01:01:02,467 --> 01:01:04,300
YOU FIGURE HE CAN
MAKE ANY MONEY OUT OF IT?

1214
01:01:04,367 --> 01:01:06,968
I DOUBT IT. THERE'S NO
REAL MONEY IN NEWSPAPERS.

1215
01:01:07,033 --> 01:01:08,934
I'M INCLINED TO AGREE
WITH YOU.

1216
01:01:12,467 --> 01:01:14,067
OH, AUNT ROSANNE.

1217
01:01:14,133 --> 01:01:16,234
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH
FOR THIS LOVELY DRESS.

1218
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,400
DO I LOOK ALL RIGHT?

1219
01:01:17,467 --> 01:01:19,033
DARLING, YOU'RE LOVELY,
OF COURSE,

1220
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,467
BUT YOUR HAIR, IT'S RATHER
PROVINCIAL, DON'T YOU THINK?

1221
01:01:21,534 --> 01:01:22,934
SHALL I GO BACK AND CHANGE IT?

1222
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,400
OH, NO, YOU HAVEN'T TIME.
YOU'VE BEEN FUSSING FOR HOURS.

1223
01:01:25,467 --> 01:01:27,300
AND, SERENA,
PLEASE DON'T CALL ME "AUNT."

1224
01:01:27,367 --> 01:01:29,200
CALL ME ROSANNE,
THE WAY LANCE DOES.

1225
01:01:29,267 --> 01:01:31,601
ANOTHER THING, SERENA -
STOP THROWING YOURSELF AT JARED.

1226
01:01:31,667 --> 01:01:34,100
HE'S IN LOVE WITH ANOTHER WOMAN,
ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS.

1227
01:01:34,167 --> 01:01:37,167
ROSANNE, GENERAL GRANT.

1228
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:47,367
GENERAL ULYSSES S. GRANT.

1229
01:01:55,234 --> 01:01:58,100
MRS. FERRIS.
MR. FERRIS.

1230
01:01:58,167 --> 01:01:59,534
GENERAL,
IT'S A GREAT HONOR.

1231
01:01:59,601 --> 01:02:01,033
DELIGHTED TO BE HERE,
I'M SURE.

1232
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:02,667
GENERAL,
THIS IS INDEED A PLEASURE.

1233
01:02:02,734 --> 01:02:03,834
THANK YOU, MRS. FERRIS.

1234
01:02:03,901 --> 01:02:05,968
MAY WE PRESENT YOU TO SOME
OF OUR FRIENDS, GENERAL?

1235
01:02:06,033 --> 01:02:07,467
I'D BE GLAD TO MEET THEM.

1236
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:20,968
GOOD EVENING, SIR.

1237
01:02:21,033 --> 01:02:23,267
GOOD EVENING.
I MUST SEE MR. FERRIS.

1238
01:02:23,334 --> 01:02:24,467
YES, JUST A MOMENT, SIR.

1239
01:02:24,534 --> 01:02:25,501
HELLO, MR. CROUCH.

1240
01:02:25,567 --> 01:02:27,367
HELLO, LANCE.
WHERE'S YOUR UNCLE?

1241
01:02:27,467 --> 01:02:29,634
I'VE GOT TO SEE HIM.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

1242
01:02:29,701 --> 01:02:31,968
WELL, COME WITH ME.
I'LL TAKE YOU TO HIM.

1243
01:02:39,167 --> 01:02:40,968
RALPH?
YES?

1244
01:02:41,033 --> 01:02:43,167
AH, CROUCH, GLAD YOU COULD COME.
HAVE A DRINK.

1245
01:02:43,234 --> 01:02:44,334
LATER.

1246
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,501
SOMETHING WRONG?

1247
01:02:46,567 --> 01:02:48,100
YEAH.

1248
01:02:48,167 --> 01:02:49,200
WHAT IS IT?

1249
01:02:49,267 --> 01:02:52,501
LOOK AT THIS.

1250
01:02:52,567 --> 01:02:54,067
"GOLDEN MOON CASE MOVED UP

1251
01:02:54,133 --> 01:02:56,968
FOR IMMEDIATE HEARING
IN FEDERAL COURT."

1252
01:02:57,033 --> 01:02:58,701
OH, THAT'S BAD.

1253
01:02:58,767 --> 01:03:03,734
LANCE?
YES.

1254
01:03:03,801 --> 01:03:06,100
YOU JOIN US THERE, TOO.
I'LL NEED YOU.

1255
01:03:09,767 --> 01:03:11,767
AND THE BANKERS BACK EAST
WERE TELLING ME

1256
01:03:11,834 --> 01:03:13,501
ABOUT A YOUNG FELLOW
NAMED EDISON

1257
01:03:13,567 --> 01:03:15,767
WHO WAS TRYING TO INTEREST THEM
IN A NEW LIGHT

1258
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:18,067
THAT LOOKED LIKE A RED-HOT
HAIRPIN IN A BOTTLE.

1259
01:03:20,667 --> 01:03:23,467
HARRY,
MEET ME IN THE LIBRARY.

1260
01:03:25,901 --> 01:03:28,634
UNCLE RALPH.

1261
01:03:28,701 --> 01:03:30,801
I- I DON'T MEAN TO DISTURB YOU,
UNCLE RALPH,

1262
01:03:30,868 --> 01:03:33,300
BUT YOU'RE SO BUSY I NEVER GET
A CHANCE TO SEE YOU.

1263
01:03:33,367 --> 01:03:35,467
WELL, WHAT IS IT, SERENA?
WHAT'S SO URGENT?

1264
01:03:35,534 --> 01:03:37,467
IT'S ABOUT FATHER.
HE'S ALMOST DESPERATE.

1265
01:03:37,534 --> 01:03:39,133
UNLESS YOU HELP HIM,
UNCLE RALPH,

1266
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,234
WE'LL LOSE BANNOCKBURN.

1267
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,200
LISTEN, CHILD,
THE LOSS OF BANNOCKBURN

1268
01:03:42,267 --> 01:03:43,601
IS ONLY A DROP
IN THE BUCKET

1269
01:03:43,667 --> 01:03:45,601
COMPARED TO THE MILLIONS
WE STAND TO LOSE

1270
01:03:45,667 --> 01:03:47,834
IF THAT BULLHEADED FATHER
OF YOURS HAS HIS WAY.

1271
01:03:47,901 --> 01:03:49,100
FINE TIME TO ASK MY HELP.

1272
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:51,567
FATHER DIDN'T KNOW MY REASON
FOR COMING HERE.

1273
01:03:51,634 --> 01:03:54,234
WELL,
RALPH, WHAT IS IT?

1274
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,267
SORRY, DARLING.
I CAN'T DISCUSS IT NOW.

1275
01:03:56,334 --> 01:03:58,467
ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.
IN MY STUDY.

1276
01:04:05,334 --> 01:04:06,767
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1277
01:04:06,834 --> 01:04:08,100
NOTHING.

1278
01:04:08,167 --> 01:04:10,167
HOW ABOUT A DANCE,
SPRAT?

1279
01:04:16,234 --> 01:04:18,667
SIT DOWN, GENTLEMEN.

1280
01:04:18,734 --> 01:04:22,501
WELL,
WHAT'S THE COMMOTION?

1281
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:24,834
SOMEONE IN SACRAMENTO
SLIPPED UP ON US. WHAT?

1282
01:04:24,901 --> 01:04:26,434
THE FEDERAL COURT'S
GOING TO HEAR

1283
01:04:26,501 --> 01:04:27,901
THE RANCHERS' CASE
ON THE 2nd.

1284
01:04:27,968 --> 01:04:28,901
THAT'S WEDNESDAY.

1285
01:04:28,968 --> 01:04:30,400
EXACTLY.
YOU HAVE FOUR DAYS.

1286
01:04:30,467 --> 01:04:32,067
HOW DID THEY GET AWAY
WITH A THING LIKE THAT?

1287
01:04:32,133 --> 01:04:33,734
THAT CROWD AT BANNOCKBURN
MUST BE DESPERATE.

1288
01:04:33,801 --> 01:04:34,767
THEY'LL TAKE ANY CHANCE.

1289
01:04:34,834 --> 01:04:36,234
WHAT WILL THAT MEAN
TO THE MARKET?

1290
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,033
IT'LL BE OFF FOR A
WHILE, BUT IT CAN'T LAST.

1291
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:39,634
YOU BETTER SCUTTLE UP
TO SACRAMENTO

1292
01:04:39,701 --> 01:04:41,300
THE FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING, CROUCH.

1293
01:04:41,367 --> 01:04:42,601
I CAN START TONIGHT.

1294
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:44,100
WELL, THAT'S BETTER.
YOU GO WITH HIM, WHITNEY.

1295
01:04:44,167 --> 01:04:47,000
HE'LL NEED YOUR HELP
IN PREPARING OUR CASE.

1296
01:04:47,067 --> 01:04:48,868
WELL, GO AHEAD.
GET STARTED.

1297
01:04:48,934 --> 01:04:50,133
THERE'S A TRAIN AT 11:40.

1298
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,801
IF YOU HURRY,
YOU CAN CATCH IT.

1299
01:04:51,868 --> 01:04:52,901
THAT'S GOOD.

1300
01:04:52,968 --> 01:04:54,167
IN THE MEANTIME,

1301
01:04:54,234 --> 01:04:56,100
WE'LL SEND UP ORDERS
TO BARRICADE THE MINE

1302
01:04:56,167 --> 01:04:57,467
AGAINST ANY HOT-HEADED FOOLS

1303
01:04:57,534 --> 01:04:59,334
THAT MIGHT TRY
TO JUMP THE GUN ON US.

1304
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,601
WE'LL OBLIGE THOSE RANCHERS
COURT OR NO COURT.

1305
01:05:01,667 --> 01:05:03,300
NOW, LISTEN.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE'LL DO.

1306
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:06,901
PARDON ME, LANCE.

1307
01:05:06,968 --> 01:05:08,567
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO SERENA.
DO YOU MIND?

1308
01:05:08,634 --> 01:05:11,467
I DON'T MIND.
AND I'M SURE SHE DOESN'T.

1309
01:05:14,234 --> 01:05:16,667
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1310
01:05:16,734 --> 01:05:19,033
I WANT TO SAY GOODBYE TO
YOU QUICKLY. YOU'RE LEAVING?

1311
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:21,367
WELL, JUST FOR A FEW DAYS.
I'VE GOT TO GO TO SACRAMENTO.

1312
01:05:21,434 --> 01:05:23,000
JARED, IS THERE
GOING TO BE TROUBLE?

1313
01:05:23,067 --> 01:05:24,634
TROUBLE?
WHY SHOULD THERE BE TROUBLE?

1314
01:05:24,701 --> 01:05:25,701
PLEASE TELL ME THE TRUTH.

1315
01:05:25,767 --> 01:05:27,234
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

1316
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:29,167
I MEAN, WE'VE GOT A BUSINESS,
AND WE NEED TO PROTECT IT.

1317
01:05:29,234 --> 01:05:30,901
OH, AND THIS IS WHAT YOU MEANT
AT BANNOCKBURN

1318
01:05:30,968 --> 01:05:33,033
WHEN YOU SAID IF THEY COME UP,
THEY BETTER COME SHOOTING?

1319
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,400
OH, IT WOULDN'T GO AS FAR
AS THAT.

1320
01:05:34,467 --> 01:05:35,834
PLEASE BELIEVE ME.
I KNOW THESE MEN.

1321
01:05:35,901 --> 01:05:39,067
JARED, I'VE TRIED TO SEE IT
YOUR WAY.

1322
01:05:39,133 --> 01:05:41,868
I WANTED TO.
BUT I CAN'T.

1323
01:05:41,934 --> 01:05:43,267
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT MY FATHER

1324
01:05:43,334 --> 01:05:45,667
AND ALL THE PEOPLE I'VE KNOWN
SINCE I WAS A CHILD ARE WRONG.

1325
01:05:45,734 --> 01:05:47,267
THEY'RE HONEST,
HARDWORKING PEOPLE,

1326
01:05:47,334 --> 01:05:48,734
AND ALL THEY WANT
IS THEIR LAND.

1327
01:05:48,801 --> 01:05:50,834
WHAT DO THESE MEN WANT?
MONEY AND MORE MONEY.

1328
01:05:50,901 --> 01:05:52,601
AND THEY DON'T CARE
HOW THEY GET IT.

1329
01:05:52,667 --> 01:05:53,801
THEY'RE WRONG, JARED.

1330
01:05:53,868 --> 01:05:55,901
AND IF YOU STAY WITH THEM,
YOU'LL BE WRONG, TOO.

1331
01:05:55,968 --> 01:05:58,734
OH, DARLING. YOU'RE TAKING
THIS THING MUCH TOO SERIOUSLY.

1332
01:05:58,801 --> 01:05:59,834
NO, I'M NOT.

1333
01:05:59,901 --> 01:06:02,000
I CAME UP FROM THE VALLEY
JUST A FEW DAYS AGO,

1334
01:06:02,067 --> 01:06:03,567
AND I KNOW
HOW THOSE MEN FEEL.

1335
01:06:03,634 --> 01:06:05,501
IF YOU PUSH THEM TOO FAR,
THEY'LL FIGHT,

1336
01:06:05,567 --> 01:06:06,901
AND THERE'LL
BE MEN KILLED.

1337
01:06:06,968 --> 01:06:08,801
AND YOU'LL HAVE THAT
ON YOUR CONSCIENCE

1338
01:06:08,868 --> 01:06:10,200
ALL THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE.

1339
01:06:10,267 --> 01:06:11,767
NO, DARLING,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1340
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:13,400
THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE
ANY KILLING.

1341
01:06:13,467 --> 01:06:15,901
IF YOU GO ON
WITH THOSE MEN, JARED,

1342
01:06:15,968 --> 01:06:18,601
THERE'LL NEVER
BE ANY HAPPINESS FOR US.

1343
01:06:18,667 --> 01:06:20,400
CAN'T I MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND

1344
01:06:20,467 --> 01:06:22,968
THAT IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY?
MY JOB?

1345
01:06:23,033 --> 01:06:26,100
I BEG YOUR PARDON.
WE'VE GOT TO HURRY, WHITNEY.

1346
01:06:26,167 --> 01:06:28,467
ALL RIGHT.

1347
01:06:28,534 --> 01:06:30,701
I'M SORRY, DARLING.

1348
01:06:35,067 --> 01:06:37,701
WE JUST GOT TIME
TO MAKE IT.

1349
01:06:46,501 --> 01:06:50,434
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHAT IS IT, SPRAT?

1350
01:06:50,501 --> 01:06:52,234
I'M GOING BACK HOME,
LANCE.

1351
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,834
I CAN'T STAY HERE ANY LONGER.
I JUST CAN'T.

1352
01:06:54,901 --> 01:06:56,133
SURE, IF YOU WANT TO.

1353
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,567
I'M SICK OF THIS PLACE
AND THESE PEOPLE.

1354
01:06:58,634 --> 01:07:01,534
THEY'RE NOT REAL, LANCE.
THEY'RE NOT OUR KIND.

1355
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:03,534
DID SOMEBODY HURT YOU,
HONEY?

1356
01:07:03,601 --> 01:07:06,033
WELL, THEN,
WHAT IS THE TROUBLE?

1357
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:10,567
I'M GOING BACK TO FATHER
BECAUSE HE NEEDS ME.

1358
01:07:10,634 --> 01:07:14,000
UNCLE RALPH AND JARED AND ALL
THE OTHERS ARE FIGHTING HIM.

1359
01:07:14,067 --> 01:07:17,167
YOU SEE, LANCE, YOU AND I
HAVE ALWAYS QUARRELED

1360
01:07:17,234 --> 01:07:18,400
WITH FATHER BECAUSE -

1361
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:20,400
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T SEE THINGS
THE WAY WE DID.

1362
01:07:20,467 --> 01:07:22,267
BUT HE'S STANDING UP
FOR SOMETHING

1363
01:07:22,334 --> 01:07:23,834
THAT HE KNOWS IS RIGHT,

1364
01:07:23,901 --> 01:07:26,701
AND IT'S NOT IN OUR BLOOD
TO LET HIM FIGHT IT OUT ALONE.

1365
01:07:26,767 --> 01:07:27,934
I'M GOING BACK TO HIM.

1366
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,701
THERE'S A TRAIN
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.

1367
01:07:29,767 --> 01:07:30,968
I'LL GET A CARRIAGE -

1368
01:07:31,033 --> 01:07:32,868
NEVER MIND.
I CAN MAKE IT MYSELF.

1369
01:07:32,934 --> 01:07:35,901
DIDN'T YOU ALWAYS SAY
WE FERRISES STAND TOGETHER?

1370
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:38,234
LANCE.

1371
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:40,400
AND I GUESS
WE STILL DO, SPRAT.

1372
01:07:50,033 --> 01:07:54,968
THIS HEARING WILL DECIDE
A GREAT ISSUE.

1373
01:07:56,501 --> 01:07:57,934
PROCEED.

1374
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,467
YOUR HONOR,
I'D LIKE FOR MR. FERRIS

1375
01:08:00,534 --> 01:08:02,434
TO CLOSE OUR CASE
IN THIS HEARING,

1376
01:08:02,501 --> 01:08:04,167
SPEAKING HIS MIND
FOR US ALL.

1377
01:08:08,467 --> 01:08:11,501
JUDGE CLAYBURN, WHAT ELSE
CAN YOU NEED TO KNOW?

1378
01:08:11,567 --> 01:08:13,133
YOU'VE HEARD BOTH SIDES.

1379
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,901
TO THEM, THIS INJUNCTION
WE'RE ASKING FOR

1380
01:08:15,968 --> 01:08:19,667
IS ONLY A MATTER OF DIVIDENDS,
A LITTLE GOLD, MORE OR LESS.

1381
01:08:19,734 --> 01:08:22,834
BUT TO US RANCHERS,
IT MEANS LIFE OR DEATH.

1382
01:08:22,901 --> 01:08:24,467
OUR LAND IS ALL WE'VE GOT.

1383
01:08:24,534 --> 01:08:28,000
WE BOUGHT IT TO MAKE HOMES
FOR OURSELVES AND OUR CHILDREN.

1384
01:08:28,067 --> 01:08:30,434
BETWEEN US,
WE'VE CLEARED 100,000 ACRES

1385
01:08:30,501 --> 01:08:33,634
THAT ONCE WAS WASTELAND,
SCRUB, AND DESERT.

1386
01:08:33,701 --> 01:08:35,701
ON IT, WE RAISED WHEAT -

1387
01:08:35,767 --> 01:08:37,901
10 MILLION BUSHELS A YEAR,

1388
01:08:37,968 --> 01:08:39,534
AND IT GOES OUT
TO FEED THE WORLD,

1389
01:08:39,601 --> 01:08:41,334
EVEN TO FRANCE AND ENGLAND.

1390
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,801
EACH YEAR, A MILLION MEN,
WOMEN, AND CHILDREN

1391
01:08:43,868 --> 01:08:46,033
DEPEND ON US
FOR THEIR DAILY BREAD.

1392
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:48,901
WE HAVE ONLY ONE QUESTION
TO ASK -

1393
01:08:48,968 --> 01:08:51,334
DOES THE LAW OF THIS COUNTRY
GIVE ONE MAN THE RIGHT

1394
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,400
TO RUIN ANOTHER MAN'S LAND,

1395
01:08:53,467 --> 01:08:56,234
TO STAND ON A MOUNTAIN
AND THROW MUD IN HIS FACE?

1396
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,901
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE MINERS
ARE DOING TO US,

1397
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,567
AND THAT'S WHY
WE'VE COME TO YOU,

1398
01:09:00,634 --> 01:09:02,501
BECAUSE WE TRUST IN THE LAW,

1399
01:09:02,567 --> 01:09:04,634
AND WE TRUST A COURT
ACTING UNDER IT

1400
01:09:04,701 --> 01:09:07,400
AS WE TRUST IN GOD HIMSELF.

1401
01:09:09,634 --> 01:09:11,868
YOUR HONOR, I'M GLAD
WE FINALLY FOUND SOMEBODY

1402
01:09:11,934 --> 01:09:14,400
WHO COULD ADD UP THE COMPLAINTS
OF THESE GENTLEMEN,

1403
01:09:14,467 --> 01:09:16,868
SOMEONE WHO COULD
SPEAK HIS MIND FOR ALL OF THEM.

1404
01:09:16,934 --> 01:09:18,367
NOW WE KNOW
WHERE WE STAND.

1405
01:09:18,434 --> 01:09:20,567
NOW MAYBE WE CAN GET DOWN
TO CASES.

1406
01:09:20,634 --> 01:09:23,734
MR. FERRIS, YOU SAY THAT YOU
AND YOUR MEN BOUGHT THIS LAND.

1407
01:09:23,801 --> 01:09:25,167
YES, SIR. WE DID.

1408
01:09:25,234 --> 01:09:27,634
YOU PAID THE SPANIARDS $8
AN ACRE FOR IT, DIDN'T YOU?

1409
01:09:27,701 --> 01:09:29,534
BUT, YOUR HONOR,
THIS MORNING IN COURT,

1410
01:09:29,601 --> 01:09:31,501
HE PLACES A VALUE OF $800 AN ACRE ON IT.

1411
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:34,100
NOW, THAT'S QUITE A NEAT
LITTLE PROFIT, DON'T YOU THINK?

1412
01:09:34,167 --> 01:09:36,167
WHEAT ALONE'S WORTH THAT.

1413
01:09:36,234 --> 01:09:37,934
OH, YES. WHEAT.
OF COURSE.

1414
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,300
I FORGET YOU FEED A MILLION
PEOPLE IN FRANCE AND ENGLAND.

1415
01:09:41,367 --> 01:09:43,701
BUT OUR GOLD FEEDS 10 MILLION
TO YOUR ONE,

1416
01:09:43,767 --> 01:09:45,734
AND THEY ARE
10 MILLION AMERICANS.

1417
01:09:45,801 --> 01:09:48,200
NOW, YOU FARMERS HAVE BEEN
STUCK UP THERE

1418
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:49,667
IN YOUR HILLS SINCE 1867.

1419
01:09:49,734 --> 01:09:52,000
YOU DON'T KNOW
AND YOU DON'T CARE

1420
01:09:52,067 --> 01:09:54,033
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE REST
OF THIS COUNTRY.

1421
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:56,167
GREAT CITIES LIKE CHICAGO
AND NEW YORK,

1422
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:59,367
RAILROADS LIKE THE CENTRAL
PACIFIC, SHIPS, MACHINERY -

1423
01:09:59,434 --> 01:10:01,300
ALL OF IT BUILT WITH GOLD.

1424
01:10:01,367 --> 01:10:03,133
BUT WHAT DO YOU CARE
ABOUT PROGRESS?

1425
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,067
YOU'VE GOT A PIECE OF LAND.

1426
01:10:05,133 --> 01:10:08,901
AND GOLD - MONEY - THE VERY
LIFEBLOOD OF THIS COUNTRY -

1427
01:10:08,968 --> 01:10:10,334
THAT MUST WAIT,

1428
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,334
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN
A LITTLE DAMAGE DONE

1429
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,467
TO A FEW BUSHELS OF WHEAT.

1430
01:10:13,534 --> 01:10:16,100
MR. FERRIS, YOU SAY
THAT YOU AND YOUR MEN

1431
01:10:16,167 --> 01:10:18,767
HAVE RECLAIMED 100,000 ACRES
OF WASTELAND,

1432
01:10:18,834 --> 01:10:21,634
BUT I SAY TO YOU
GOLD HAS RECLAIMED A NATION,

1433
01:10:21,701 --> 01:10:24,467
KEPT THIS COUNTRY GOING
THROUGH THE CIVIL WAR

1434
01:10:24,534 --> 01:10:25,868
AND WON IT IN THE END.

1435
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:28,934
YOUR HONOR, IF YOU CUT OFF
THIS GOLD SUPPLY FROM AMERICA,

1436
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,901
YOU'RE CUTTING OFF
HER VERY LIFE,

1437
01:10:30,968 --> 01:10:33,567
JUST AS SURE AS IF YOU CHOKED
A WOMAN'S THROAT

1438
01:10:33,634 --> 01:10:35,934
BETWEEN YOUR HANDS.

1439
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,734
AND THAT RESPONSIBILITY
IS YOURS.

1440
01:10:43,467 --> 01:10:47,200
I WILL TAKE THIS MATTER
UNDER CONSIDERATION.

1441
01:10:47,267 --> 01:10:50,801
I WILL SUBMIT MY DECISION
TO BOTH PARTIES WITHIN 24 HOURS.

1442
01:10:50,868 --> 01:10:53,734
COURT IS ADJOURNED.

1443
01:11:19,968 --> 01:11:22,567
IT'S SACRAMENTO.

1444
01:11:25,767 --> 01:11:28,434
"CHRISTOPHER FERRIS,

1445
01:11:28,501 --> 01:11:32,000
"TENSPOT, CALIFORNIA.

1446
01:11:32,067 --> 01:11:37,133
"SACRAMENTO VALLEY FARMERS

1447
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:41,067
ARE GRANTED INJUNCTION... "

1448
01:11:44,901 --> 01:11:48,200
"GOLDEN MOON MINE.

1449
01:11:48,267 --> 01:11:51,567
JUDGE CLAYBURN."

1450
01:11:51,634 --> 01:11:53,234
WE'VE DONE IT!

1451
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,601
WELL?

1452
01:12:20,667 --> 01:12:22,033
GENTLEMEN,
WE'VE LOST THE SUIT.

1453
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,400
IMPOSSIBLE.

1454
01:12:23,467 --> 01:12:25,167
HYDRAULICKING'S BEEN JUDGED
A PUBLIC NUISANCE.

1455
01:12:25,234 --> 01:12:26,634
WHAT USED TO BE A CIVIL SUIT
FOR DAMAGES

1456
01:12:26,701 --> 01:12:27,734
IS NOW A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

1457
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:29,734
PUT IT IN PLAIN LANGUAGE.
WHAT'S IT MEAN?

1458
01:12:29,801 --> 01:12:30,901
IT MEANS IF WE KEEP ON,

1459
01:12:30,968 --> 01:12:32,701
WE'RE BUCKING
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

1460
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:34,167
YOUR BROTHER'S TAKEN OUT
AN INJUNCTION

1461
01:12:34,234 --> 01:12:35,367
AGAINST
THE GOLDEN MOON MINE.

1462
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:36,667
THEY HAVEN'T HAD TIME
TO SERVE IT.

1463
01:12:36,734 --> 01:12:38,133
NO, AND THEY'RE NOT
GOING TO SERVE IT.

1464
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,634
IF THEY WANT A FIGHT,
THEY'RE GOING TO GET IT.

1465
01:12:39,701 --> 01:12:41,100
WHITNEY, YOU GET UP THERE
AND HOLD THEM OFF,

1466
01:12:41,167 --> 01:12:42,400
EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO SHOOT.

1467
01:12:42,467 --> 01:12:44,334
CAN'T DO IT, McCOOEY.
IT WOULD MEAN OPEN WAR.

1468
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,734
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
IT'S WAR.

1469
01:12:45,801 --> 01:12:47,567
BUT YOU DEFEND THAT MINE
AT ANY COST.

1470
01:12:47,634 --> 01:12:49,467
HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT
WHAT THE COST WILL BE?

1471
01:12:49,534 --> 01:12:50,834
DON'T BE A FOOL,
WHITNEY.

1472
01:12:50,901 --> 01:12:53,100
A FEW MEN MIGHT GET HURT,
OF COURSE. WE CAN'T HELP THAT.

1473
01:12:53,167 --> 01:12:55,400
IT ISN'T A MATTER OF A FEW MEN.
I KNOW THOSE RANCHERS.

1474
01:12:55,467 --> 01:12:56,901
THERE'LL BE 300 OF THEM
UP THERE

1475
01:12:56,968 --> 01:12:58,701
AT THAT BARRICADE
IF YOU REFUSE SERVICE.

1476
01:12:58,767 --> 01:13:00,033
THAT ISN'T A FIGHT.
IT'S A MASSACRE.

1477
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:01,367
CALL IT ANYTHING YOU LIKE.

1478
01:13:01,434 --> 01:13:03,834
WE'RE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT
SERVICE, AND THAT'S FINAL.

1479
01:13:03,901 --> 01:13:06,234
IN THREE MONTHS, WE'LL HAVE
THAT DECISION REVERSED.

1480
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:09,000
IN THE MEANTIME, THE GOLDEN
MOON'S GOING RIGHT ON OPERATING

1481
01:13:09,067 --> 01:13:11,334
IF WE HAVE TO BLAST OUT
EVERY RANCHER IN THE VALLEY.

1482
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,434
NOW, LISTEN, McCOOEY.

1483
01:13:12,501 --> 01:13:14,200
HYDRAULICKING IS OVER,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

1484
01:13:14,267 --> 01:13:15,801
THAT'S FOR US TO DECIDE,
WHITNEY.

1485
01:13:15,868 --> 01:13:17,367
NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME,
ALL OF YOU.

1486
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:19,567
I STRUNG WITH YOU AS LONG
AS YOU WERE ACTING LEGALLY.

1487
01:13:19,634 --> 01:13:21,567
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO REBELLING
AGAINST THE LAW

1488
01:13:21,634 --> 01:13:23,467
AND PLANNING WHOLESALE MURDER,
I'M THROUGH!

1489
01:13:23,534 --> 01:13:24,701
AND ANOTHER THING -

1490
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:26,467
AS LONG AS I'M IN CHARGE
OF THE GOLDEN MOON MINE,

1491
01:13:26,534 --> 01:13:27,467
THEY'LL BE NO KILLING.

1492
01:13:27,534 --> 01:13:28,901
AND YOU CAN TAKE IT
OR LEAVE IT.

1493
01:13:28,968 --> 01:13:31,767
GENTLEMEN, WHEN YOU WANT TO
REACH ME, I'LL BE AT THE MINE.

1494
01:13:34,267 --> 01:13:36,367
I WAS AFRAID
WE COULDN'T TRUST HIM.

1495
01:13:36,434 --> 01:13:39,434
DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHITNEY.
I'VE MADE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.

1496
01:13:41,367 --> 01:13:44,334
MR. MINTON.

1497
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,667
GENTLEMEN, THIS IS MR. MINTON,
OUR FOREMAN.

1498
01:13:46,734 --> 01:13:48,033
HOW ARE YOU?

1499
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:49,067
HOW DO YOU DO,
GENTLEMEN?

1500
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:52,100
HAVE A CHAIR.
THANKS.

1501
01:13:52,167 --> 01:13:55,767
WELL,
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

1502
01:14:16,434 --> 01:14:18,367
GET THE REST
OF THOSE RIFLES.

1503
01:14:18,434 --> 01:14:20,734
TAKE AS MANY AS YOU CAN
AND FILL UP YOUR POCKETS.

1504
01:14:20,801 --> 01:14:22,200
GROGAN, YOU KNOW HOW
TO USE THAT THING?

1505
01:14:22,267 --> 01:14:25,067
SURE. BUT I'D FIRST LIKE TO KNOW
WHY I'M USING IT?

1506
01:14:25,133 --> 01:14:27,267
TO KEEP YOUR THICK HEAD
IN ONE PIECE.

1507
01:14:27,334 --> 01:14:29,167
ALL RIGHT. COME ON.

1508
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:34,367
OH, HE'S HAD TIME ENOUGH
TO GET UP THERE

1509
01:14:34,434 --> 01:14:35,434
AND BACK TWICE OVER.

1510
01:14:35,501 --> 01:14:36,968
MAYBE HE'S NEVER
COMING BACK.

1511
01:14:37,033 --> 01:14:38,033
MUST HAVE GOT COLD FEET,

1512
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:39,767
JUST LIKE THE LAST TIME
HE COME HERE

1513
01:14:39,868 --> 01:14:41,000
AND SERVED THE INJUNCTION.

1514
01:14:41,067 --> 01:14:42,234
IF I HAD MY WAY,

1515
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:43,868
WE WOULDN'T WAIT
FOR A FEDERAL INJUNCTION.

1516
01:14:43,934 --> 01:14:45,067
WE'D GO UP THERE
OURSELVES.

1517
01:14:45,133 --> 01:14:46,434
MAC, WE SAID WE'D WAIT.

1518
01:14:46,501 --> 01:14:48,601
BESIDES, THERE'S NO SENSE
IN ALL OF US GOING UP THERE.

1519
01:14:48,667 --> 01:14:50,267
THEY MIGHT TAKE IT
THE WRONG WAY.

1520
01:14:50,334 --> 01:14:52,901
HERE HE COMES!

1521
01:14:59,667 --> 01:15:01,734
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

1522
01:15:04,467 --> 01:15:06,100
WHAT HAPPENED?

1523
01:15:08,634 --> 01:15:09,834
WHAT HAPPENED?

1524
01:15:09,901 --> 01:15:11,834
I WOULDN'T GET MIXED
UP IN A THING LIKE THIS

1525
01:15:11,901 --> 01:15:13,334
FOR ALL THE MONEY
IN THE WORLD.

1526
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:14,567
AS A RULE IT'S EASY.

1527
01:15:14,634 --> 01:15:16,634
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
GIVE THE MAN HIS PAPERS.

1528
01:15:16,701 --> 01:15:18,834
BUT THESE MINERS -
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE LAW.

1529
01:15:18,901 --> 01:15:21,267
THEY'VE GOT BARRICADES,
AND THEY'VE GOT MEN WITH GUNS,

1530
01:15:21,334 --> 01:15:23,534
AND THEY INTEND TO USE
THEM. ARE YOU SCARED?

1531
01:15:23,601 --> 01:15:25,868
WELL, WHY SHOULD I GO UP THERE
AND LET THEM KILL ME?

1532
01:15:25,934 --> 01:15:27,467
I HAVE A WIFE
AND THREE CHILDREN.

1533
01:15:27,534 --> 01:15:29,667
AND IF YOU RANCHERS
WANT THIS INJUNCTION SERVED,

1534
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:31,300
YOU'LL HAVE TO SERVE IT
YOURSELVES.

1535
01:15:31,367 --> 01:15:33,067
HERE. LET ME HAVE IT.
I'LL SERVE IT.

1536
01:15:33,133 --> 01:15:35,767
MY JOB AS MUCH AS YOURS, LANCE.
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

1537
01:15:35,834 --> 01:15:37,300
MINE TOO, MAC.

1538
01:15:44,367 --> 01:15:46,868
OPEN THE GATE!
IT'S MR. WHITNEY!

1539
01:16:00,033 --> 01:16:03,067
DO YOU EXPECT THE UNITES STATES
ARMY TO ATTACK?

1540
01:16:03,133 --> 01:16:04,901
WE AIN'T AIMING
FOR NO ONE TO SNEAK IN

1541
01:16:04,968 --> 01:16:06,400
AND GIVE US
A SURPRISE PARTY.

1542
01:16:06,467 --> 01:16:08,501
YOUR HIDES WILL BE SAFE.
YOU BET THEY WILL.

1543
01:16:08,567 --> 01:16:10,000
I MEANT WHAT I SAID,
HARRIS.

1544
01:16:10,067 --> 01:16:11,934
THE FIRST MOTHER SON OF YOU
WHO STARTS ANY TROUBLE

1545
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,667
WITH THESE VALLEY PEOPLE
WILL ANSWER TO ME.

1546
01:16:13,734 --> 01:16:15,000
JUST REMEMBER THAT.
ALL RIGHT.

1547
01:16:44,234 --> 01:16:46,801
ALL RIGHT!
STRETCH OUT ALONG DOWN THERE!

1548
01:16:46,868 --> 01:16:48,133
COME ON! GET IN THERE!

1549
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,334
HEY, YOU TWO! FILL IN DOWN THERE
ALONG THE LINE!

1550
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,667
MINTON!

1551
01:16:51,734 --> 01:16:52,834
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1552
01:16:52,901 --> 01:16:54,334
WHO TOLD YOU TO ISSUE
THOSE GUNS?

1553
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,300
I GOT MY ORDERS THE SAME PLACE
YOU GOT YOURS.

1554
01:16:56,367 --> 01:16:58,334
YOU KEEP OUT OF THIS, WHITNEY.
YOU BEEN FIRED.

1555
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,501
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1556
01:16:59,567 --> 01:17:01,300
HEY!

1557
01:17:01,367 --> 01:17:03,868
ALL OF YOU,
DROP THOSE GUNS!

1558
01:17:03,934 --> 01:17:05,634
YOU GET YOUR TIME
AND GET OUT.

1559
01:17:05,701 --> 01:17:07,434
THIS MINE IS BEING CLOSED
BY A FEDERAL LAW.

1560
01:17:07,501 --> 01:17:09,801
IT AIN'T CLOSED YET, WHITNEY,
AND IT AIN'T GONNA BE CLOSED.

1561
01:17:09,868 --> 01:17:11,934
THIS MINE WILL KEEP RIGHT
ON OPERATING, LAW OR NO LAW.

1562
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,701
IF ANYBODY LEAVES HERE,
IT'S GONNA BE YOU!

1563
01:17:13,767 --> 01:17:16,033
THERE'S YOUR DISCHARGE,
MISTER!

1564
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:18,767
TELL THOSE MEN
TO KEEP THEIR EYES OPEN!

1565
01:17:27,467 --> 01:17:29,868
SOME OF THE RANCHERS
ARE COMING UP THE ROAD, BOYS.

1566
01:17:29,934 --> 01:17:33,200
YOU SURE ARE COMING
TO THE RIGHT SHOP, OLD-TIMERS!

1567
01:17:33,267 --> 01:17:36,767
OLD MAN FERRIS' KID -
HE'S PROBABLY DRUNK AGAIN.

1568
01:17:41,467 --> 01:17:44,267
STOP IF YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU!

1569
01:17:44,334 --> 01:17:45,400
WHERE'S JARED WHITNEY?

1570
01:17:45,467 --> 01:17:46,968
HE AIN'T SEEING
NOBODY TODAY.

1571
01:17:47,033 --> 01:17:48,200
WELL, WE'RE GONNA SEE HIM,

1572
01:17:48,267 --> 01:17:49,901
AND WE'RE NOT LEAVING
TILL WE DO.

1573
01:17:49,968 --> 01:17:52,634
I'VE GOT A GREETING
FROM THE FEDERAL COURT FOR YOU.

1574
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:55,934
HEY! DROP THOSE GUNS!
OPEN THAT GATE!

1575
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,601
TURN AROUND AND GET GOING!

1576
01:18:09,434 --> 01:18:10,901
STOP, LANCE! HE'LL KILL YOU!

1577
01:18:22,634 --> 01:18:24,467
LANCE.

1578
01:18:34,367 --> 01:18:36,167
KEEP BACK!

1579
01:19:14,734 --> 01:19:16,133
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO LANCE?

1580
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,801
DON'T BLAME WHITNEY, BOYS.
IT WASN'T HIS FAULT.

1581
01:19:28,133 --> 01:19:29,801
THE BOY NEVER HAD
A CHANCE, CHRIS.

1582
01:19:29,868 --> 01:19:31,300
WHITNEY RAN DOWN
TO WARN US,

1583
01:19:31,367 --> 01:19:33,334
BUT THEY FIRED
BEFORE HE COULD REACH US.

1584
01:19:41,667 --> 01:19:44,501
BRING HIM INTO THE LIBRARY
AND PUT HIM ON THE COUCH.

1585
01:19:49,334 --> 01:19:51,167
THERE.

1586
01:20:13,167 --> 01:20:16,601
SPRAT.

1587
01:20:16,667 --> 01:20:17,767
I...

1588
01:20:17,834 --> 01:20:19,434
I WOULDN'T
TRY TO TALK, SON.

1589
01:20:19,501 --> 01:20:22,801
I'VE GOT TO.

1590
01:20:22,868 --> 01:20:26,300
IT WASN'T JARED'S FAULT.

1591
01:20:26,367 --> 01:20:31,701
HE TRIED TO TELL ME,
BUT... I WOULDN'T LISTEN.

1592
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:37,634
HANG ON, BOY.
US FERRISES DON'T QUIT.

1593
01:21:25,801 --> 01:21:30,133
GATHER YOUR MEN TOGETHER,
MacKENZIE, AND GET YOUR GUNS.

1594
01:21:57,367 --> 01:21:58,868
JARED -

1595
01:21:58,934 --> 01:22:01,634
WHY DID THEY SEND HIM,
SERENA - A KID LIKE THAT?

1596
01:22:01,701 --> 01:22:03,767
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME
FOR ANYONE ELSE.

1597
01:22:03,834 --> 01:22:05,634
WHOEVER WENT UP
WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.

1598
01:22:05,701 --> 01:22:08,367
AND NOW FATHER AND THE OTHERS
ARE GOING. NO. THEY CAN'T.

1599
01:22:08,434 --> 01:22:10,033
AND THEY'LL KILL
AND BE KILLED,

1600
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:12,567
AND EVERY HOME IN THIS VALLEY
WILL BE LIKE THIS ONE.

1601
01:22:12,634 --> 01:22:14,467
WELL, THEY CAN'T!
THEY MUSTN'T!

1602
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,400
COME ON.

1603
01:22:32,467 --> 01:22:33,801
GIDDAP!

1604
01:22:33,868 --> 01:22:36,367
MISTER,
MY FEET SURE IS HURTING.

1605
01:22:36,434 --> 01:22:39,767
AFTER THE FIGHT, MAYBE THEY
NEVER WILL BOTHER YOU AGAIN.

1606
01:22:45,267 --> 01:22:47,868
HERE THEY COME, WIDE OPEN.

1607
01:22:47,934 --> 01:22:50,534
WHEN THEY GET WITHIN RANGE, PICK
OFF EVERY LIVING SON OF THEM.

1608
01:22:50,601 --> 01:22:52,300
I'M GOING OVER
TO THE NORTH BARRICADE.

1609
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:55,033
EDDIE, YOU AND JOE
COME WITH ME.

1610
01:22:58,267 --> 01:22:59,868
HALT.

1611
01:22:59,934 --> 01:23:02,467
JIM.

1612
01:23:02,534 --> 01:23:04,934
WE'RE DIVIDING THE FORCE
INTO THREE PARTS -

1613
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,334
ONE TO SPREAD UP ON EACH SIDE OF
THE RAVINE TO COVER THE FLANKS.

1614
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,667
THE MAIN BODY HERE
FOR A FRONTAL ATTACK.

1615
01:23:10,734 --> 01:23:13,667
ED, YOU LEAD ONE FORCE -
30 MEN UP THAT SIDE.

1616
01:23:13,734 --> 01:23:15,901
JIM, YOU TAKE THE SAME NUMBER
OF MEN UP THERE.

1617
01:23:15,968 --> 01:23:16,934
AND KEEP UNDERCOVER.

1618
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,834
WAIT!

1619
01:23:18,901 --> 01:23:20,400
WHEN THE MINERS START SHOOTING,

1620
01:23:20,467 --> 01:23:22,100
KEEP THEM BUSY
WITH A RUNNING FIRE

1621
01:23:22,167 --> 01:23:23,534
WHILE WE GO UP THE HILL.

1622
01:23:23,601 --> 01:23:27,501
AND IF WE DON'T GET UP,
YOU KEEP TRYING UNTIL YOU DO.

1623
01:23:27,567 --> 01:23:30,667
START UP.

1624
01:23:36,968 --> 01:23:39,467
THIS HERE'S EXACTLY
THE SAME SITUATION

1625
01:23:39,534 --> 01:23:41,667
WE HAD AT GETTYSBURG,
REMEMBER?

1626
01:23:41,734 --> 01:23:45,534
JOHN ON CEMETERY RIDGE.
LOUISIANA BOYS ON THE LEFT.

1627
01:23:45,601 --> 01:23:46,767
LONGSTREET ON THE RIGHT.

1628
01:23:46,834 --> 01:23:48,667
AND US -
WE MAKE PICKETT'S CHARGE.

1629
01:23:48,734 --> 01:23:50,934
I HOPE WE HAVE BETTER LUCK
THIS TIME, ENOCH.

1630
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,701
PSHAW.
ME AND LULA BELLE HERE -

1631
01:23:52,767 --> 01:23:54,467
WE'LL STILL BE
THE FUSSINGS UP.

1632
01:23:54,534 --> 01:23:55,901
NO, ENOCH, YOU STAY BEHIND.

1633
01:23:55,968 --> 01:23:58,467
NEED A GOOD MAN TO TAKE CARE
OF THE HORSES.

1634
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:10,734
WELL, WE'LL WIN, JUST LIKE
WE WON AT CHICKAMAUGA.

1635
01:24:10,801 --> 01:24:12,634
YOU BOYS ALL WON?

1636
01:24:12,701 --> 01:24:15,767
WELL, IF WE HADN'T, YOU WOULDN'T
BE RUNNING AROUND LOOSE.

1637
01:24:15,834 --> 01:24:16,934
COME ON, BOYS!

1638
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,801
LET'S GET THESE HORSES
UNDER COVER!

1639
01:24:18,868 --> 01:24:20,667
COME ON!

1640
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:25,801
THEY'RE COMING UP
IN THREE DIRECTIONS.

1641
01:24:25,868 --> 01:24:27,033
THERE'S A BUNCH IN THE MIDDLE

1642
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:28,567
AND A BUNCH SNEAKING UP
EACH SIDE.

1643
01:24:28,634 --> 01:24:31,667
GET READY, MEN.
THE PARTY'S ABOUT TO BEGIN.

1644
01:25:00,801 --> 01:25:03,434
FELLAS, WAIT!

1645
01:25:03,501 --> 01:25:05,033
THERE'S ANOTHER WAY IN THERE,
A BETTER WAY.

1646
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:06,567
PLEASE BELIEVE ME
THAT THIS IS SUICIDE.

1647
01:25:08,667 --> 01:25:09,801
JUST GIVE ME 30 MINUTES,

1648
01:25:09,868 --> 01:25:11,300
AND GET YOUR MEN OUT
OF THIS RAVINE AT ONCE.

1649
01:25:11,367 --> 01:25:12,434
THAT'S ALL I ASK.

1650
01:25:19,234 --> 01:25:21,501
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I'M WITH YOU,
MR. FERRIS?

1651
01:25:21,567 --> 01:25:23,367
PLEASE BELIEVE ME
WHEN I TELL YOU

1652
01:25:23,434 --> 01:25:25,167
THAT LANCE
WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

1653
01:25:29,067 --> 01:25:30,400
WE'LL WAIT.

1654
01:25:35,734 --> 01:25:39,400
GET UP IN THOSE HILLS
AND KEEP UNDERCOVER, MEN!

1655
01:25:43,601 --> 01:25:45,667
WONDER WHAT
THEY'RE WAITING FOR.

1656
01:25:45,734 --> 01:25:47,901
MAYBE THEY WANT
A PERSONAL INVITE.

1657
01:25:47,968 --> 01:25:49,133
I'LL GIVE THEM ONE.

1658
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:50,167
NO, DON'T SHOOT.

1659
01:25:50,234 --> 01:25:51,601
YOU'LL LIABLE
TO SCARE THEM AWAY,

1660
01:25:51,667 --> 01:25:52,934
AND WE'LL MISS
ALL THE FUN.

1661
01:26:15,834 --> 01:26:18,734
I CAN'T STAND THIS WAITING
ANY LONGER, CHRIS.

1662
01:26:18,801 --> 01:26:19,934
LET'S GET MOVING.

1663
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,234
I SAID WE'D WAIT.

1664
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:24,567
HEY, SLAG,
THERE GOES WHITNEY.

1665
01:26:24,634 --> 01:26:26,033
WONDER WHAT HE'S DOING
UP THERE.

1666
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:28,334
HE'S GOT A BUNDLE OF DYNAMITE
AND HE'S HEADED FOR THE DAM.

1667
01:26:34,534 --> 01:26:38,000
THERE'S THE SIGNAL!

1668
01:26:42,067 --> 01:26:44,133
WAIT, MEN, WAIT!

1669
01:26:49,567 --> 01:26:52,000
YOU GOT HIM THAT TIME.

1670
01:26:52,067 --> 01:26:56,634
GET TO THE BARRICADE!
I GOT TO MAKE SURE I GOT HIM!

1671
01:28:29,167 --> 01:28:31,834
ENOCH, THE HORSES -
CUT THEM LOOSE!

1672
01:28:43,734 --> 01:28:46,801
THE WATER! GET OUT OF HERE, MEN!
THE DAM'S BREAKING!

1673
01:30:55,901 --> 01:30:58,701
IN THE CASE OF
THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY FARMERS

1674
01:30:58,767 --> 01:31:00,567
vs. THE GOLDEN MOON
MINING SYNDICATE,

1675
01:31:00,634 --> 01:31:03,300
SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA
DENIES THE APPEAL

1676
01:31:03,367 --> 01:31:04,601
OF THE DEFENSE.

1677
01:31:06,334 --> 01:31:08,734
COURT FULLY REALIZES
THAT ITS DECISION

1678
01:31:08,801 --> 01:31:10,601
IS OF FAR-REACHING IMPORTANCE,

1679
01:31:10,667 --> 01:31:13,701
NOT ONLY TO THIS STATE,
BUT TO THE ENTIRE NATION.

1680
01:31:13,767 --> 01:31:15,267
FROM THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE HEARD,

1681
01:31:15,334 --> 01:31:18,000
IT IS CLEARLY ESTABLISHED
THAT THE DEBRIS FROM THE MINES

1682
01:31:18,067 --> 01:31:20,434
HAS CHOKED THE RIVERS
AND SPREAD OVER THE VALLEY,

1683
01:31:20,501 --> 01:31:22,033
DESTROYING THOUSANDS OF ACRES

1684
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:24,567
AND COVERING A FRUITFUL LAND
WITH BARRENNESS.

1685
01:31:24,634 --> 01:31:26,000
NO SYSTEM OF LAW ON EARTH

1686
01:31:26,067 --> 01:31:28,834
TOLERATES THE USE OF ONE MAN'S
PROPERTY IN THIS WAY,

1687
01:31:28,901 --> 01:31:31,234
SO AS TO DESTROY THE PROPERTY
OF ANOTHER.

1688
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,400
UNQUESTIONABLY,
THE ACTS OF THE DEFENDANT

1689
01:31:39,467 --> 01:31:40,968
CONSTITUTE A PUBLIC NUISANCE,

1690
01:31:41,033 --> 01:31:43,601
AND AS SUCH THEY ARE UNLAWFUL
IN THEIR INCEPTION

1691
01:31:43,667 --> 01:31:44,968
AND IN THEIR CONTINUANCE.

1692
01:31:45,033 --> 01:31:47,767
THEREFORE, THE SUPREME COURT
CONFIRMS THE DECISION

1693
01:31:47,834 --> 01:31:48,968
OF THE LOWER COURT

1694
01:31:49,033 --> 01:31:52,534
AND GRANTS THE PLAINTIFFS
THE RELIEF AS CLAIMED.

1695
01:31:52,601 --> 01:31:55,434
WE ORDER THAT THE DECREE
BE SO ENTERED.

1696
01:31:57,167 --> 01:32:01,767
LET THIS ALSO BE RECORDED
FOR THE FUTURE.

1697
01:32:01,834 --> 01:32:04,934
THE CLAIM OF THE DEFENDANT
MAY BE TRUE -

1698
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,834
THAT GOLD IS THE BLOOD
OF THE NATION -

1699
01:32:06,901 --> 01:32:10,601
BUT THE EARTH IS ITS HEART
AND ITS SOUL.

1700
01:32:10,667 --> 01:32:14,234
THE LAND IS FOR THE PEOPLE.
IT DOESN'T CHANGE.

1701
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:18,400
ITS FRUITS ARE MORE PRECIOUS
AND INEXHAUSTIBLE.

1702
01:32:18,467 --> 01:32:23,067
AND, GOD WILLING, MAY IT
CONTINUE TO SURVIVE ITS SPOILS.

1703
01:32:23,133 --> 01:32:28,133
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER GOLD
HERE, A GOLD WE COULD NEVER SEE.

1704
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:31,968
SOMEDAY, ORCHARDS
WILL COVER THIS VALLEY,

1705
01:32:32,033 --> 01:32:34,601
THE ONE BEYOND,
AND THE ONE BEYOND THAT,

1706
01:32:34,667 --> 01:32:36,434
CLEAR DOWN TO THE OCEAN.

1707
01:32:36,501 --> 01:32:40,601
AND THERE'LL BE LONG ROWS OF
TREES AS FAR AS A MAN CAN SEE,

1708
01:32:40,667 --> 01:32:43,667
ALL GOLD AND GREEN
AND HEAVILY LADEN WITH PRUNES

1709
01:32:43,734 --> 01:32:46,868
AND GRAPE VINEYARDS
IN THE HILLS.

1710
01:32:46,934 --> 01:32:48,968
AND SOMEDAY, SOMEHOW,

1711
01:32:49,033 --> 01:32:51,033
THEY'RE GOING TO SHIP IT
ACROSS THE CONTINENT

1712
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:52,901
TO ALL THE WORLD.

1713
01:32:52,968 --> 01:32:55,868
THAT'S THE FUTURE
OF CALIFORNIA -

1714
01:32:55,934 --> 01:32:57,868
NOT GOLD.

1715
01:32:57,934 --> 01:33:00,667
AND IT WILL BE OUR FUTURE,
TOO, JARED.

1716
01:33:00,734 --> 01:33:04,167
ISN'T THAT SOMETHING TO LIVE
AND WORK FOR?
