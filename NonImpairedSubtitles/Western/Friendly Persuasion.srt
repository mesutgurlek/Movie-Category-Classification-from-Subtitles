1
00:02:20,857 --> 00:02:22,592
<i>This is Samantha...</i>

2
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,161
<i>... my mother's pet goose.</i>

3
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:26,529
<i>Mama loves her...</i>

4
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:28,865
<i>... just like one of the family.</i>

5
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:31,701
<i>But I hate that bird.</i>

6
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:33,136
<i>And she hates me.</i>

7
00:02:33,136 --> 00:02:35,505
<i>She's mean and sneaky.</i>

8
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:38,708
<i>And full of tricks.</i>

9
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:41,077
<i>It seems every First Day morning...</i>

10
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,146
<i>... when we're ready to go to Meeting...</i>

11
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:47,139
<i>... and I got on</i>
<i>my best Sunday clothes...</i>

12
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:13,799
Samantha!

13
00:04:00,456 --> 00:04:02,258
Thee old hisser!

14
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:06,251
I'll blow thee up with a cannon!

15
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:10,822
Some day I'll drown thee,
thee old squawker!

16
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,203
Little Jess!
What is thee saying, child?

17
00:04:14,203 --> 00:04:16,306
Samantha tried to bite my legs off.

18
00:04:16,306 --> 00:04:18,908
Next time, I'll throw her down the well.

19
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:21,311
Here, Samantha.

20
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:22,645
See, Little Jess?

21
00:04:22,645 --> 00:04:25,581
Speak to her kindly.
She'll not bite thee.

22
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:27,750
She's a pure pet, Samantha is.

23
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,486
She's a snake on stilts!

24
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:33,556
I'll put her on the chopping block
and chop her head off.

25
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:34,924
Hush, hush!

26
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:37,760
Let's have no more talk of killing.

27
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,753
Run upstairs now and fetch thy brother
and sister. We'll be late for Meeting.

28
00:04:56,946 --> 00:04:58,614
Blackberry pie?

29
00:04:58,614 --> 00:05:00,450
Yes, blackberry pie.

30
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,820
No need to stick thy finger in it
to find out. No dilly-dallying!

31
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,813
Go fetch Mattie and Josh.

32
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:12,985
Well...

33
00:05:13,496 --> 00:05:17,489
...perhaps.

34
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:21,270
Well!

35
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,263
This afternoon?

36
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:32,537
All right!

37
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,619
What's thee talking to thyself for?

38
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:38,955
I'm not talking to myself.

39
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:40,990
Who's thee talking to then?

40
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,959
I don't see nobody.

41
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,361
Thee knows what happens
to eavesdroppers?

42
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:49,354
Their ears get long as a hound dog's!

43
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,468
Mama says to hurry.

44
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:55,471
I am, but I have to finish
my toilet-tee.

45
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:56,773
What's a toilet-tee?

46
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,942
Thee wouldn't know about it
because thee doesn't wash.

47
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:03,880
Please leave my boudoir.

48
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,883
"Please leave my boudoir."

49
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:10,876
Does thee...

50
00:06:11,654 --> 00:06:15,647
Does thee think I'm pretty?

51
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:25,101
Thee's not ugly.

52
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:27,670
I guess thee's pretty...

53
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,440
...for a girl.

54
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,642
Well, thank thee!

55
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:36,635
Thee's welcome.

56
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:48,424
Powie! I got Jeff Davis!

57
00:06:48,424 --> 00:06:50,660
Powie! I got old Stonewall Jackson!

58
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,653
Powie! I got old Little Jess Birdwell!

59
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,467
Meet the real Stonewall Jackson...

60
00:06:57,467 --> 00:07:00,403
...and thee won't feel so feisty.
Get up.

61
00:07:00,403 --> 00:07:02,872
What would thee do
if thee met Old Stonewall?

62
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:05,007
Mama said not to talk about the war.

63
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,009
Mama said for thee to hurry up.

64
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,079
She's the preacher.
Meeting can't start till she's there.

65
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,072
And anyway, Caleb Cope and me
are riding our horses to Meeting.

66
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:22,058
Thee old long arms!

67
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:24,026
Look! Pa's warming up Red Rover.

68
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:28,019
Where?

69
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,878
How a horse can look so fast
and move so slow beats me.

70
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:01,464
Thee can hitch him up, Enoch.

71
00:08:01,464 --> 00:08:05,457
You got him nice and warm this morning.

72
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:09,005
Whoa, Mildred!

73
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:10,740
Hello there.

74
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,733
Guess I'm lost.
Must have got on the wrong road.

75
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:18,080
My! Quite a looker, that horse.

76
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,582
He's a looker, all right.

77
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:23,419
Maybe you can help me. I'm trying
to find that Methodist church.

78
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,223
Thy first turn's at the crossroads.
Bear right for three miles.

79
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:29,225
Is thee preaching there this morning?

80
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:31,060
- Who's preaching there?
- Thee?

81
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,162
- Who?
- Thee.

82
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:35,932
Me?

83
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,935
That's a dandy!
Son, I'm not a man of the cloth.

84
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,536
I sell organs.

85
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:44,173
Now, what in thunderation is all this
thee-ing and thou-ing about?

86
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:46,209
Bible talk to honor the Sabbath?

87
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:49,545
No, we talk that way weekdays too.

88
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:52,114
Excuse me, but it sounds mighty queer.

89
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,583
Who's "we"?

90
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,151
Quakers.

91
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:58,221
Quakers! Have you folks
got a church around here?

92
00:08:58,221 --> 00:09:02,214
Yes, we call it a Meeting House.
It's just beyond the Methodist Church.

93
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:05,728
Hast thou an organ in thine
Meeting House, friend?

94
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:07,730
We don't hold with music playing.

95
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,066
What, no organ?

96
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:12,735
Dear me! Why, a church
without an organ...

97
00:09:12,735 --> 00:09:15,204
...is like a tree without a bird.

98
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:17,773
Wait till I talk
to that minister of yours.

99
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:21,766
He'll never be content
until he buys an organ.

100
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:23,913
I wish thee luck with the preacher.

101
00:09:23,913 --> 00:09:27,717
That's three miles over, take
the main road, turn right. I got it.

102
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:28,918
Thank you.

103
00:09:28,918 --> 00:09:30,286
Thee.

104
00:09:30,286 --> 00:09:32,989
Get up!

105
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,523
Now look, Mildred...

106
00:09:34,523 --> 00:09:37,126
...there is a horse!

107
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:41,119
- I'm going by Caleb's, Pa.
- All right, son.

108
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:47,937
Red Rover, that man
paid thee a compliment.

109
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:51,930
If he only knew.

110
00:09:55,244 --> 00:09:57,813
Listen, Red, just don't slow down...

111
00:09:57,813 --> 00:10:01,284
...when thee hears Sam Jordan
coming behind us...

112
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:04,320
...and, by sugar, we'll stay
out in front today.

113
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,313
- Thee say something, Jess?
- I was just soothing Red Rover.

114
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:12,161
If thee talked as much to the Almighty
as thee does to that horse...

115
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:15,531
...thee might stand more squarely
in the light.

116
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,234
Sounds like thy sermon's
already begun, Eliza.

117
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:21,570
Why, Jess!
I thought thee liked my preaching.

118
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,563
Now, Eliza, thee has the prettiest
pulpit voice I ever heard.

119
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:27,943
And thee says the truest words.

120
00:10:27,943 --> 00:10:31,936
Especially during Silent Meeting?

121
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:37,642
And this morning,
thee looks like a girl.

122
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,889
Where's Little Jess? Mattie!

123
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,882
I'm coming, Mama.

124
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:51,556
Made the stockade in the nick of time.

125
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:02,311
- Goodbye, folks.
- Goodbye, Enoch.

126
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:03,813
Good luck, Mr. Birdwell.

127
00:11:03,813 --> 00:11:07,116
Why does Enoch wish thee good luck
every First Day morning?

128
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:11,109
I guess it's because he...
He wishes me luck!

129
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,673
Hey, Papa, look!

130
00:12:17,353 --> 00:12:19,889
It's thy friend, Sam Jordon, Jess.

131
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:23,882
No need to look. I can feel him.

132
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,996
Gard's with him!

133
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,966
Mattie, Little Jess, stop craning
thy necks at the Jordans.

134
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:32,701
It isn't seemly.

135
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:36,694
Yes, Mama.

136
00:12:37,473 --> 00:12:41,466
Sure are a-coming.

137
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,749
Thee's not urging thy horse?

138
00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:50,742
Not urging. Just encouraging a mite.

139
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:17,713
Come on, Red Rover!

140
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:21,706
Sit down!

141
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,028
Come on, Prince!

142
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:37,021
Come on, lazybones!

143
00:13:43,372 --> 00:13:47,365
Come on, Prince! Good boy!

144
00:13:49,311 --> 00:13:53,304
What's gotten into thee?

145
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:06,484
Morning, Mattie.

146
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:15,226
Morning, Eliza.
Good morning, Jess.

147
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:26,337
- Come on, Papa!
- Come on, Prince!

148
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:30,920
Come back, come back!

149
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,987
Mama!

150
00:14:31,987 --> 00:14:35,391
Little Jess, let go!

151
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:39,384
Come on, Prince!

152
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,326
Gard winked at Mattie.

153
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:46,295
He did not!

154
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:47,863
I saw him.

155
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:51,856
Gard wouldn't do such a vulgar thing!

156
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:06,048
I hope nobody saw us.

157
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,585
Me too.

158
00:16:09,585 --> 00:16:13,578
I want to come to Meeting with nothing
in my heart but peace and love.

159
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:28,960
Thee gives me a pain.

160
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,688
<i>One eternal day</i>

161
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:30,259
<i>There, God the Son</i>
<i>Forever reigns</i>

162
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:33,362
<i>And scatters night away</i>

163
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,832
<i>Filled with delight</i>
<i>My raptured soul</i>

164
00:18:36,832 --> 00:18:40,335
<i>Would here no longer stay</i>

165
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:43,572
<i>Though Jordan's waves around me roll</i>

166
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:47,565
<i>Fearless I'd launch away</i>

167
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:15,838
Last week...

168
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:19,341
...I had my 80th birthday.

169
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:23,334
And I'd like to bear witness
to <i>Proverbs.</i>

170
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,681
First chapter...

171
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:29,184
...33rd verse.

172
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:31,720
"Who so harkeneth unto Me...

173
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,755
...shall dwell safely...

174
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:37,748
...and shall be quiet
from fear of evil."

175
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:43,354
Amen, Emma. Amen.

176
00:19:56,645 --> 00:20:00,215
I ask the prayers of everyone here
to help me be less worldly...

177
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:03,118
...less concerned about my appearance...

178
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,753
...to mind my tongue...

179
00:20:04,753 --> 00:20:08,746
...and especially have the strength
not to wear earrings.

180
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,763
I've never spoken in Meeting before...

181
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:18,600
...but I feel so happy this morning
I'd like to share my happiness...

182
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,436
...with everyone in the whole world.

183
00:20:21,436 --> 00:20:25,429
And to thank our Heavenly Father.

184
00:20:35,717 --> 00:20:39,710
God is love!

185
00:21:18,927 --> 00:21:22,920
- Is this it?
- Yes, sir.

186
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:03,438
Won't thee come in, friend?

187
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:05,273
Thank you.

188
00:22:05,273 --> 00:22:07,709
You're the minister of this meeting?

189
00:22:07,709 --> 00:22:11,702
I am. One of them.

190
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:27,529
My name is Major Harvey.

191
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:31,522
- Won't thee sit down, friend?
- Thank you, no.

192
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,993
I've had the duty placed upon me of
speaking to you Quakers about the war.

193
00:22:37,005 --> 00:22:39,374
It is a matter much on our minds...

194
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:40,876
...and in our prayers.

195
00:22:40,876 --> 00:22:43,612
But your men don't fight in it.

196
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,480
Some have.

197
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,749
But you do not encourage them.

198
00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:51,086
We do not encourage them.

199
00:22:51,086 --> 00:22:55,079
Ma'am, the Union has endured
two years of bloody civil war.

200
00:22:55,323 --> 00:22:59,316
Thousands have given their lives in
battle to free our country from slavery.

201
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:03,999
We are opposed to slavery.

202
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:07,992
But we do not believe it right
to kill one man to free another.

203
00:23:10,872 --> 00:23:14,865
Ma'am, it's not going to be a question
of fighting for freedom or a principle...

204
00:23:15,844 --> 00:23:19,837
...but of protecting our own towns,
our own homes, from attack.

205
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:32,383
Would you men stand by while others
die to protect you?

206
00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:48,376
You look like a boy who could give a
good account of himself.

207
00:23:48,376 --> 00:23:50,445
I've been tempted to fight.

208
00:23:50,445 --> 00:23:54,438
I guess the Good Lord knows why.

209
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:59,421
I mean, sometimes I get the
sinful wish to get into a scrap.

210
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:03,125
So I got to watch myself
closer than most people.

211
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:05,427
So I'll just stay away from the war.

212
00:24:05,427 --> 00:24:09,420
Because if I ever got into it,
I'd be a goner.

213
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,871
And you, son?

214
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:19,864
Are you ready to put up with looting
and killing without lifting a finger?

215
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:25,803
Are you afraid to fight?

216
00:24:26,748 --> 00:24:30,741
I don't know.

217
00:24:31,486 --> 00:24:34,556
Here, at last, is an honest answer.

218
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,558
I don't wish to offend...

219
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,551
...but how many of you are hiding
behind your church to save your skins?

220
00:24:42,797 --> 00:24:45,700
Is it right to let others fight for you?

221
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,693
To protect your lives and your property?

222
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:53,842
Why don't you speak up?

223
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:56,778
I'll speak up.

224
00:24:56,778 --> 00:25:00,771
Nothing could ever induce me
to bear arms against my fellow man.

225
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,451
Burn my house!

226
00:25:03,451 --> 00:25:07,444
Destroy my crops! Attack my family!

227
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:11,749
And I declare to all...

228
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:16,086
...especially to thee, Josh Birdwell,
wavering in thy convictions...

229
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:19,467
...nothing can move me to violence!

230
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:23,460
Nothing!

231
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:29,099
It seems Friend Purdy has already
been moved to considerable violence.

232
00:25:30,545 --> 00:25:34,015
I misdoubt any of us here
could say with surety...

233
00:25:34,015 --> 00:25:38,008
...what we would do in case of attack.

234
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,613
I have my doubts as to the strength
of thy convictions too.

235
00:25:44,492 --> 00:25:48,485
I have my own doubts.

236
00:25:50,198 --> 00:25:53,201
I've often asked myself...

237
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:57,194
...what I would do if I saw
my family endangered...

238
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,832
...my wife and children threatened.

239
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:06,915
If the test comes, all I can say is...

240
00:26:06,915 --> 00:26:10,908
...I hope and pray I can be an
instrument of the Lord.

241
00:26:11,286 --> 00:26:15,290
That test is coming.

242
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,593
It may well be so, friend.

243
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:22,063
Let us pray that the will of God
be revealed to us...

244
00:26:22,063 --> 00:26:26,056
...and we be given the strength
and grace to follow His will.

245
00:26:36,978 --> 00:26:39,147
Lord...

246
00:26:39,147 --> 00:26:43,140
...let Thy children partake of Thy love
and the love of all men...

247
00:26:43,218 --> 00:26:47,211
...rendering not evil for evil,
nor violence for violence done.

248
00:26:48,657 --> 00:26:52,027
Let swords be changed into
ploughshares...

249
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,963
...and spears into pruning hooks...

250
00:26:54,963 --> 00:26:58,956
...and children of peace
learn war no more...

251
00:26:59,634 --> 00:27:03,627
...forever.

252
00:28:26,087 --> 00:28:29,324
Eliza, what does thee like about
that shifty-eyed bird?

253
00:28:29,324 --> 00:28:32,227
Why, Jess!

254
00:28:32,227 --> 00:28:35,096
She marches along so lordly-like.

255
00:28:35,096 --> 00:28:39,089
Marched real lordly through two pecks
of young strawberries this morning.

256
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,152
- Hello, Gard.
- Hello, Josh.

257
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,354
- You home on leave?
- Got a week's furlough.

258
00:28:59,354 --> 00:29:03,347
Hello, Little Jess, Mrs. Birdwell.

259
00:29:03,858 --> 00:29:07,851
Hello, Mr. Birdwell.

260
00:29:08,263 --> 00:29:11,833
I came over to apologize about
that little brush last Sunday.

261
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,001
It wasn't my idea.

262
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,269
We know that.

263
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:18,262
Jess is going to get a nice slow horse
that doesn't have any racing ideas.

264
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:24,412
Did thee shoot any rebs?

265
00:29:24,412 --> 00:29:26,314
What are they like?

266
00:29:26,314 --> 00:29:29,184
They're just people like us.

267
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,752
But did thee shoot any?

268
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,687
Let's have no more talk of war...

269
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,255
...and killing.

270
00:29:34,255 --> 00:29:35,690
I'm sorry, ma'am.

271
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,294
- Come in and set.
- Thank you.

272
00:29:39,294 --> 00:29:41,463
You folks going to the fair?

273
00:29:41,463 --> 00:29:44,032
I used to like the fair...

274
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,434
...but it's come to be
no place for us.

275
00:29:46,434 --> 00:29:48,303
They've got some fine exhibits.

276
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:51,139
Needlework, livestock, poultry.

277
00:29:51,139 --> 00:29:52,807
And geese.

278
00:29:52,807 --> 00:29:56,511
Eliza, it might be just the place
to pick us up a nice slow horse.

279
00:29:56,511 --> 00:30:00,504
Thee go, Jess. The fair's come to have
so many sideshows, freaks, dancing...

280
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:04,219
Dancing?
What does thee know about dancing?

281
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,454
She knows a thing or two.

282
00:30:06,454 --> 00:30:09,290
Did Mama ever dance?

283
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:11,493
That was 20 years ago.

284
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:13,495
Twenty years exactly, come October.

285
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:14,963
I was courting her.

286
00:30:14,963 --> 00:30:16,931
But did Mama dance?

287
00:30:16,931 --> 00:30:19,133
No, child.

288
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:23,126
She was tempted to lift a foot,
but she married me instead.

289
00:30:23,338 --> 00:30:25,740
Did thee propose then and there?

290
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,742
Dinner's ready.
Stay and eat with us?

291
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:30,545
Thank you, ma'am.
I'd be pleased to.

292
00:30:30,545 --> 00:30:32,313
What about the fair?

293
00:30:32,313 --> 00:30:34,949
- Come on, Josh, Jess.
- Can we go, Papa?

294
00:30:34,949 --> 00:30:38,486
There's no point in putting temptation
in the children's paths.

295
00:30:38,486 --> 00:30:39,787
We'd resist it.

296
00:30:39,787 --> 00:30:42,257
We'd resist it as well as thee did.

297
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,558
Why can't we go?

298
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:47,551
She'll never let us go.
Mama's so straight-laced!

299
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:55,859
Maybe I can loosen up a few laces.

300
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:36,578
Isn't it ghastly, ladies and gentlemen?

301
00:31:36,578 --> 00:31:38,279
Isn't it horrible?

302
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:41,115
This shining blade,
with the razor-edged blade...

303
00:31:41,115 --> 00:31:43,918
...will pass through his mouth,
through his throat...

304
00:31:43,918 --> 00:31:46,854
...into his very vitals!

305
00:31:46,854 --> 00:31:49,123
And here we have Flame-o...

306
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:50,892
...the Human Volcano!

307
00:31:50,892 --> 00:31:54,095
Do not deprive your children
of this educational act.

308
00:31:54,095 --> 00:31:56,130
Let's get away from here.

309
00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:00,123
- I promised Caleb I'd meet him.
- Mattie, look at the quilting with me.

310
00:32:00,568 --> 00:32:04,561
Thee wants to see quilts, Josh wants to
meet Caleb, and I want to see livestock.

311
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,108
Let's meet...

312
00:32:07,108 --> 00:32:11,101
...over here by the harvesting machine
in one hour.

313
00:32:11,145 --> 00:32:13,548
Thee stay with me.

314
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:14,616
Oh, Josh.

315
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:18,609
There's a rock exhibit I think
thee and Caleb might find edifying.

316
00:32:18,953 --> 00:32:21,556
- Rocks?
- Come along.

317
00:32:21,556 --> 00:32:23,558
I'm hungry. I want some candy.

318
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:26,628
Thee's had thy breakfast. Come along.

319
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:29,631
I'm thirsty.

320
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:33,624
You shoot that squirrel down
three times, you get a beautiful prize.

321
00:32:33,668 --> 00:32:35,236
It's a hit!

322
00:32:35,236 --> 00:32:36,337
How's that?

323
00:32:36,337 --> 00:32:37,405
Got him.

324
00:32:37,405 --> 00:32:38,640
Howdy, Mr. Birdwell.

325
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,043
Say, you're an old squirrel-shooter.
I'll treat you.

326
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:45,580
Give that man a rifle.
Another marksman here.

327
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,149
That squirrel sits so still
he makes me nervous.

328
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:50,518
Never mind the comments, just hit...

329
00:32:50,518 --> 00:32:54,389
He did hit the squirrel!

330
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,490
Where's Mattie?

331
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,625
They're over by the quilting booth.

332
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,260
See you later.

333
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,294
Thanks, Gard.

334
00:33:00,294 --> 00:33:02,697
Folks, the man's about to shoot...

335
00:33:02,697 --> 00:33:06,690
He hit it again!

336
00:33:20,148 --> 00:33:24,141
Thee wait right here.

337
00:33:56,617 --> 00:34:00,588
You won yourself one of these
beautiful prizes here.

338
00:34:00,588 --> 00:34:02,457
One of these beautiful pri...

339
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:06,060
One of these beautiful prizes.
Them prizes was made and manufactured...

340
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:09,097
...by Pierre of Paris, France.
You heard of him?

341
00:34:09,097 --> 00:34:13,090
I ain't either. The man's having a
hard time to make up his mind here.

342
00:34:15,002 --> 00:34:16,270
For Eliza?

343
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,672
- No, thanks.
- Wait!

344
00:34:17,672 --> 00:34:21,008
You won it fair and square.
I insist you take them, friend.

345
00:34:21,008 --> 00:34:24,045
There! Pair of garters
for your wife to wear!

346
00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:27,782
Or your sweetheart!

347
00:34:27,782 --> 00:34:30,518
Just as soon as you get out of mourning.

348
00:34:30,518 --> 00:34:34,511
Come on.
I want to show you something.

349
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:41,462
How about a demonstration?

350
00:34:41,462 --> 00:34:43,197
I'd just be delighted.

351
00:34:43,197 --> 00:34:45,566
Delighted. Step right in, gentlemen.

352
00:34:45,566 --> 00:34:48,169
Nothing would please me more.

353
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:52,162
Low bridge.

354
00:34:59,213 --> 00:35:01,582
Well, Mr. Birdwell, come right in.

355
00:35:01,582 --> 00:35:05,319
Gentlemen, welcome to my organatorium.
Just make yourself at home.

356
00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:08,389
A temple of temptations,
full of instruments of the devil.

357
00:35:08,389 --> 00:35:12,382
Gentlemen, I'd like you to take
a look at this magnificent instrument.

358
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,529
Now, isn't that a beauty?

359
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:18,522
Just as smooth as silk,
and as fine as frog's hair.

360
00:35:25,506 --> 00:35:29,499
I'll pay two to one if you guess
the shell which contains the pea.

361
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,414
Take your chin off the board.
You'll tip it.

362
00:35:33,414 --> 00:35:36,117
As you see, there's nothing here,
nothing here.

363
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:38,653
The pea's there,
and I put the shell over it.

364
00:35:38,653 --> 00:35:42,646
Now, we move the shells.
Watch very closely.

365
00:35:46,627 --> 00:35:50,620
Now where is the elusive little pea?

366
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:06,247
Boy...

367
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:10,240
...will you go away?

368
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,588
Forty-eight reeds,
plus the tuba miraballis.

369
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,690
How many stops?

370
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,758
So you know organs!

371
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:20,595
It has eight stops
and this vox humana.

372
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,831
Cries like a baby, sighs like a woman.

373
00:36:23,831 --> 00:36:27,435
I'm partial to music, but I'm a Quaker
and they're against music.

374
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,536
The Quaker!

375
00:36:28,536 --> 00:36:31,606
Why, certainly I remember distinctly.

376
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,475
Thee, thy, thou...
Of course.

377
00:36:34,475 --> 00:36:37,912
But I want you to know, sir,
I honor your prejudices...

378
00:36:37,912 --> 00:36:39,247
...convictions.

379
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:40,748
Boys, let me tell you...

380
00:36:40,748 --> 00:36:44,552
...there are two kinds of music just the
same as there are two kinds of women:

381
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:47,221
The uplifting kind and the...

382
00:36:47,221 --> 00:36:48,389
Now, here.

383
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:50,691
You take the banjo. Now, there.

384
00:36:50,691 --> 00:36:54,684
There is an instrument that stirs up
a man's worst passions.

385
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:18,319
Speech!

386
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:22,312
Speech, ma'am!

387
00:37:29,864 --> 00:37:31,866
Thank thee kindly.

388
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:35,859
Watch very closely. We go again.

389
00:37:37,972 --> 00:37:40,908
<i>Beware of the owl</i>
<i>Who's waiting to howl</i>

390
00:37:40,908 --> 00:37:44,901
<i>Especially beware of the crow</i>

391
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:49,450
<i>Of the...</i>

392
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:53,443
<i>... crow</i>

393
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:00,828
Oh, fellows!

394
00:38:00,828 --> 00:38:03,464
By George! That was wonderful!

395
00:38:03,464 --> 00:38:05,800
This is that rare silver process.

396
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,793
You see the fine workmanship of
Professor Grady. He is the foremost...

397
00:38:10,404 --> 00:38:14,397
Now where is the little pea?

398
00:38:26,454 --> 00:38:30,447
Thank you, madam. Thank you!
Everything's back to normal now.

399
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,777
Now, just a minute.
Place your fingers there. That's it.

400
00:38:49,777 --> 00:38:53,714
Now pump.

401
00:38:53,714 --> 00:38:55,816
Wonderful!

402
00:38:55,816 --> 00:38:58,886
Why, Friend Birdwell,
you've got a real touch.

403
00:38:58,886 --> 00:39:02,879
A real, natural-born touch.

404
00:39:04,992 --> 00:39:07,828
Ice-cold lemonade here!

405
00:39:07,828 --> 00:39:11,821
Who'll have a cold drink?

406
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,772
Has thee forgotten thyself?

407
00:39:51,772 --> 00:39:53,707
I'm to blame.

408
00:39:53,707 --> 00:39:55,876
Mattie didn't want to dance.
I made her.

409
00:39:55,876 --> 00:39:57,878
Let's look for thy father.

410
00:39:57,878 --> 00:40:00,514
It's my last day of furlough.

411
00:40:00,514 --> 00:40:04,507
I mean, I was hoping that Mattie
could stay with me for a while.

412
00:40:04,952 --> 00:40:08,945
Gardiner, thy duties as a soldier
and Mattie's as a Quaker lie far apart.

413
00:40:11,058 --> 00:40:12,593
God bless thee, Gard.

414
00:40:12,593 --> 00:40:15,863
Come along.

415
00:40:15,863 --> 00:40:19,856
Goodbye.

416
00:40:25,973 --> 00:40:28,943
That's a mighty fine fight.
A mighty fine fight!

417
00:40:28,943 --> 00:40:30,411
Here's your coat.

418
00:40:30,411 --> 00:40:33,547
All right, men. Now's your chance
to get the Billy Goat.

419
00:40:33,547 --> 00:40:36,383
Who'd like to give me a silver dollar?
Is there one man...

420
00:40:36,383 --> 00:40:38,886
Caleb Cope!
He can throw the Billy Goat!

421
00:40:38,886 --> 00:40:40,621
- Which one is that?
- There.

422
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:42,389
You mean the Quaker man here?

423
00:40:42,389 --> 00:40:46,382
Come on in here, Quaker man!

424
00:40:50,498 --> 00:40:51,932
Thee shouldn't fight.

425
00:40:51,932 --> 00:40:55,436
This ain't fighting.
This is just friendly wrestling.

426
00:40:55,436 --> 00:40:59,429
Go get him, Quaker!

427
00:41:12,753 --> 00:41:14,822
All right, gentlemen!

428
00:41:14,822 --> 00:41:17,491
May the best man win.

429
00:41:17,491 --> 00:41:21,484
Let's go!

430
00:42:23,591 --> 00:42:25,759
- Did I hurt you?
- What's wrong with you?

431
00:42:25,759 --> 00:42:28,028
You didn't hurt me. Let's go.

432
00:42:28,028 --> 00:42:29,597
No, thanks.

433
00:42:29,597 --> 00:42:33,590
Come on. Let's go.
What's the matter with you?

434
00:42:35,102 --> 00:42:36,837
The Quaker boy quit!

435
00:42:36,837 --> 00:42:40,140
- Why didn't you kiss him?
- Quitter!

436
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:44,133
Quitter!

437
00:42:46,046 --> 00:42:48,082
Hold on. I want to talk to you.

438
00:42:48,082 --> 00:42:50,985
Leave him alone.
It's against his principle to fight.

439
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:54,978
Losing a bet's against my principles.
I think you're in with the boss.

440
00:42:55,022 --> 00:42:56,790
- No, sir.
- So why'd you stop?

441
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:00,294
- He's a Quaker.
- Shut up! Who wants to hear you?

442
00:43:00,294 --> 00:43:03,097
- Let them alone! These boys believe...
- I know.

443
00:43:03,097 --> 00:43:05,299
They believe in loving their neighbor.

444
00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:08,135
I'm their neighbor.
Do you still love me?

445
00:43:08,135 --> 00:43:10,037
I feel sorry for thee, friend.

446
00:43:10,037 --> 00:43:11,839
Thee feels sorry for me?

447
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,832
Don't let him talk to you that way.
Milk sop!

448
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:20,114
If thee wants to hit
someone, friend, hit me.

449
00:43:20,114 --> 00:43:22,516
It'll be a pleasure.

450
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,118
I'll take a whack at him.

451
00:43:24,118 --> 00:43:26,920
You want to fight?

452
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,957
You aren't showing me nothing.
What's the matter, Quaker boy?

453
00:43:29,957 --> 00:43:33,950
- What's the trouble, friend?
- Another friend!

454
00:43:35,729 --> 00:43:38,132
Thee needs cooling off.

455
00:43:38,132 --> 00:43:40,668
My hat!

456
00:43:40,668 --> 00:43:44,661
- Let me up!
- Thee not thirsty, friend?

457
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,973
Is thee having an altercation?

458
00:43:59,019 --> 00:44:03,012
Okay, let's break it up.
Come on.

459
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:08,362
Fighting!

460
00:44:08,362 --> 00:44:10,664
Dancing! Gambling!

461
00:44:10,664 --> 00:44:13,334
Wrestling! And...

462
00:44:13,334 --> 00:44:15,636
- Sleeve-holders.
- Sleeve-holders?

463
00:44:15,636 --> 00:44:17,771
I never saw sleeve-holders like that.

464
00:44:17,771 --> 00:44:19,573
They're from...

465
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:23,566
...Pierre, in Paris.

466
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,018
Listen, thee dirty...

467
00:44:31,018 --> 00:44:35,011
But Mama, he took my hat.

468
00:44:56,844 --> 00:45:00,848
It'll be a pretty day. Be hot
the other side of the Ohio though.

469
00:45:00,848 --> 00:45:03,250
I wish thee didn't have to
make this trip.

470
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,919
It's too close to the war to be safe.

471
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:08,789
Now, Eliza, I have to
see my customers...

472
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:11,759
...this time of the year.

473
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:15,752
Leave Josh at home then.
He's so young to be exposed to danger.

474
00:45:16,196 --> 00:45:19,099
Thee can't keep him tied
to thy apron strings.

475
00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:22,803
This trip will be good for him.

476
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:26,796
Horse is hitched, bags stowed away,
we're off! Let's go!

477
00:45:27,174 --> 00:45:29,209
Is thee so anxious to leave home?

478
00:45:29,209 --> 00:45:32,012
I want to see Ohio.

479
00:45:32,012 --> 00:45:36,005
I'll miss thee.

480
00:45:41,355 --> 00:45:45,348
Come on, Pa!

481
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:55,825
Take good care of Josh.

482
00:45:58,305 --> 00:46:02,298
God bless and keep thee.

483
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:16,712
Jess, see if thee can't
get rid of that horse.

484
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:31,431
- Afternoon.
- Howdy!

485
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:32,966
Man of the house around?

486
00:47:32,966 --> 00:47:36,959
Ain't no man in this house
since Pa died.

487
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:44,344
And Mrs. Hudsp...

488
00:47:44,344 --> 00:47:45,445
Hudspeth?

489
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:48,949
Ma's here.

490
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:52,942
Couple of men to see you!

491
00:47:54,488 --> 00:47:58,481
Men!

492
00:48:00,093 --> 00:48:04,086
Men?

493
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:14,797
Ma's coming!

494
00:48:15,042 --> 00:48:18,211
Hi!

495
00:48:18,211 --> 00:48:22,204
Hello.

496
00:48:52,112 --> 00:48:54,314
- Mrs. Hudspeth?
- That's me.

497
00:48:54,314 --> 00:48:57,651
I'm Jess Birdwell. I have
first-class nursery stock for sale.

498
00:48:57,651 --> 00:49:00,187
- What kind?
- Everything in orchard fruits.

499
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:04,180
If thee likes apple trees, there's
Maiden's Blush, Ramblos and Winesaps.

500
00:49:05,158 --> 00:49:09,151
In the berry line, there's
raspberries, gooseberries and the like.

501
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:12,466
- This your boy?
- This is Joshua.

502
00:49:12,466 --> 00:49:14,067
Meet my girls.

503
00:49:14,067 --> 00:49:17,638
This is Opal, Ruby,
she's my baby, and Pearl.

504
00:49:17,638 --> 00:49:19,473
Gems, every one of them!

505
00:49:19,473 --> 00:49:23,466
Girls, meet Joshua.

506
00:49:24,111 --> 00:49:26,279
Back!

507
00:49:26,279 --> 00:49:28,448
Don't overdo it, girls.

508
00:49:28,448 --> 00:49:32,441
Come in the house.
Let's talk business in comfort.

509
00:49:36,323 --> 00:49:37,658
Sit down, son.

510
00:49:37,658 --> 00:49:41,651
They won't bite you.

511
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:51,494
Menfolks are so scarce here, the girls
get carried away at the sight of one.

512
00:49:52,339 --> 00:49:55,976
But I keep telling them, "Easy does it."

513
00:49:55,976 --> 00:49:57,678
Ain't that right?

514
00:49:57,678 --> 00:50:01,581
As a Quaker, I've always been
against violence, Mrs. Hudspeth.

515
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,350
A Quaker, huh?

516
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:06,420
I guessed as much
from the way you talk.

517
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,689
All that thee-ing and thy-ing.

518
00:50:08,689 --> 00:50:12,693
If I put my mind to it, I can say
you or yours if it suits thee.

519
00:50:12,693 --> 00:50:14,294
No, sir.

520
00:50:14,294 --> 00:50:17,364
"Pleased to meet thee.
Are these thy daughters?"

521
00:50:17,364 --> 00:50:19,533
Prettiest talk I ever heard.

522
00:50:19,533 --> 00:50:22,736
Makes me feel kind of romantic.

523
00:50:22,736 --> 00:50:24,504
Come sit down.

524
00:50:24,504 --> 00:50:27,474
Let's talk business back here.

525
00:50:27,474 --> 00:50:29,409
You been on the road long?

526
00:50:29,409 --> 00:50:33,402
About ten days.
Heading home tomorrow.

527
00:50:37,417 --> 00:50:39,152
See any rebel raiders?

528
00:50:39,152 --> 00:50:41,455
Everything peaceful all the way.

529
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,123
I hope you're right.

530
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:46,560
What if them ruffians come thieving
with nobody on the farm...

531
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,030
...but four defenseless women?

532
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:53,066
I shudder to think of it.

533
00:50:53,066 --> 00:50:56,269
Now, about that nursery stock...

534
00:50:56,269 --> 00:50:58,004
First look at my south 40...

535
00:50:58,004 --> 00:51:01,997
...and tell me what orchard stock
would be best there. Opal!

536
00:51:04,544 --> 00:51:06,680
Go hitch up Lady.

537
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,715
We'll drive my mare.

538
00:51:08,715 --> 00:51:12,708
Give your animal a rest.

539
00:51:14,688 --> 00:51:17,758
We can bed you down for the night.

540
00:51:17,758 --> 00:51:20,494
That's very kind.

541
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,996
- But...
- Oh, now, no buts!

542
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:25,599
Glad to have some men around
for a change.

543
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,567
Ruby.

544
00:51:27,567 --> 00:51:30,303
Go lay out some clean bedding,
will you?

545
00:51:30,303 --> 00:51:31,705
All right, Ma.

546
00:51:31,705 --> 00:51:35,008
Get going.

547
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:39,001
Pearl, take care of Josh
while we're gone.

548
00:51:47,821 --> 00:51:51,725
Now, you just set right back here.

549
00:51:51,725 --> 00:51:54,761
I don't want to be a bother.

550
00:51:54,761 --> 00:51:58,754
You ain't no bother.

551
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,135
Sure is a nice place thee has here.

552
00:52:02,135 --> 00:52:03,336
Want a smoke?

553
00:52:03,336 --> 00:52:06,239
I don't smoke.

554
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:07,407
Want a drink?

555
00:52:07,407 --> 00:52:09,176
I don't drink either.

556
00:52:09,176 --> 00:52:10,577
Thee have one.

557
00:52:10,577 --> 00:52:14,570
Not unless you do.

558
00:52:56,389 --> 00:52:58,758
Is this a Narragansett Pacer?

559
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:01,328
You know that breed?

560
00:53:01,328 --> 00:53:03,630
Thee's a favored woman.

561
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:06,399
That mare ain't got
but one real fault.

562
00:53:06,399 --> 00:53:09,769
She won't be passed.

563
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,906
- Won't be passed?
- No, sir!

564
00:53:12,906 --> 00:53:14,841
What's the fault in that?

565
00:53:14,841 --> 00:53:17,477
I've got three marriageable daughters.

566
00:53:17,477 --> 00:53:21,214
A man ain't got any heart for courting
a girl he can't catch up with...

567
00:53:21,214 --> 00:53:25,207
...let alone pass.

568
00:53:25,318 --> 00:53:29,311
It shouldn't be hard to find
a horse willing to be passed.

569
00:53:30,657 --> 00:53:33,493
Hello, Abigail!

570
00:53:33,493 --> 00:53:35,629
That's old Whiskey Pete.

571
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:39,622
He ain't drawed a sober breath
in 30 years.

572
00:53:46,606 --> 00:53:50,599
Fool's always trying to race somebody.

573
00:53:56,516 --> 00:54:00,509
Old drunk!

574
00:54:02,289 --> 00:54:05,592
Why don't thee let her out?
Don't fight her. Let her go!

575
00:54:05,592 --> 00:54:09,585
I'm going to learn this consarned mare
she's got to be passed!

576
00:54:14,301 --> 00:54:15,302
Put my hat on!

577
00:54:15,302 --> 00:54:16,770
Pull it down!

578
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:20,763
Not that far!

579
00:54:25,245 --> 00:54:26,479
What are you doing?

580
00:54:26,479 --> 00:54:30,472
It's all right.

581
00:54:51,471 --> 00:54:55,464
Easy, Lady. Easy.

582
00:54:56,276 --> 00:55:00,269
Sorry, I kind of overreached myself,
grabbing the reins thataway.

583
00:55:01,648 --> 00:55:03,616
Don't apologize.

584
00:55:03,616 --> 00:55:07,609
For a man, it's suitable to beat
another man in a race on a public road.

585
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:16,429
Do you ever think about getting
thy girls a horse a mite more...

586
00:55:16,429 --> 00:55:18,498
...maidenly-acting?

587
00:55:18,498 --> 00:55:22,335
I've thought of it.

588
00:55:22,335 --> 00:55:25,238
You've got a stylish animal.

589
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,340
Red Rover's a looker, all right.

590
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:30,276
Got racing notions?

591
00:55:30,276 --> 00:55:32,846
Not that he can't pick up
his heels a bit.

592
00:55:32,846 --> 00:55:36,449
But racing's a thing
he's got no stomach for.

593
00:55:36,449 --> 00:55:40,442
You wouldn't consider a trade, I reckon.

594
00:55:41,788 --> 00:55:42,956
I don't know.

595
00:55:42,956 --> 00:55:46,393
A strong-minded animal like this
can be a plaguey nuisance.

596
00:55:46,393 --> 00:55:50,386
A forceful man like yourself
could learn her better in no time.

597
00:55:50,497 --> 00:55:54,490
If you's a mind to.

598
00:55:55,301 --> 00:55:57,270
Seems a likely exchange.

599
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:00,373
Then let's shake on it.

600
00:56:00,373 --> 00:56:04,366
Don't leave it hanging.

601
00:56:17,857 --> 00:56:21,850
<i>A handsome young drummer</i>
<i>Came by in the spring</i>

602
00:56:22,062 --> 00:56:24,764
<i>With beautiful laces</i>

603
00:56:24,764 --> 00:56:27,300
<i>In cases</i>

604
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,537
<i>I'm sorry, she said</i>

605
00:56:30,537 --> 00:56:33,973
<i>I can't buy anything</i>

606
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:37,966
<i>'Tis love that I need</i>

607
00:56:38,378 --> 00:56:42,371
<i>More than laces</i>

608
00:56:43,416 --> 00:56:47,409
<i>Won't you marry me</i>

609
00:56:47,954 --> 00:56:49,722
<i>Marry me</i>

610
00:56:49,722 --> 00:56:52,692
<i>Up to the altar please carry me</i>

611
00:56:52,692 --> 00:56:56,663
<i>Give me combs for my curls</i>
<i>Made of silver and pearls</i>

612
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,799
<i>And a two-penny bridal bouquet</i>

613
00:56:59,799 --> 00:57:01,868
<i>Say</i>

614
00:57:01,868 --> 00:57:03,403
<i>Hurry up</i>

615
00:57:03,403 --> 00:57:04,938
<i>Hurry up</i>

616
00:57:04,938 --> 00:57:07,907
<i>Hitch that old horse to the surrey up</i>

617
00:57:07,907 --> 00:57:11,711
<i>And I'll vow to be true</i>
<i>To no one but you</i>

618
00:57:11,711 --> 00:57:15,704
<i>So marry me, marry me, do</i>

619
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:21,677
<i>Dear Lady,</i>
<i>The handsome young drummer replied</i>

620
00:57:22,422 --> 00:57:26,415
<i>The whole situation's bewildering</i>

621
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:30,897
<i>Last winter the cough</i>

622
00:57:30,897 --> 00:57:34,901
<i>Carried off my poor bride</i>

623
00:57:34,901 --> 00:57:38,894
<i>If you want to take care</i>

624
00:57:39,973 --> 00:57:43,966
<i>Of six children</i>

625
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:48,448
<i>Come and marry me</i>

626
00:57:48,448 --> 00:57:49,849
<i>Marry me</i>

627
00:57:49,849 --> 00:57:53,842
<i>Pack your valises and marry me</i>

628
00:58:12,138 --> 00:58:16,131
They're coming!

629
00:58:20,013 --> 00:58:24,006
They're coming!

630
00:58:40,633 --> 00:58:44,626
I'm glad to have thee home.

631
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:48,541
- Thee'll break my ribs!
- I'll get the bags.

632
00:58:48,541 --> 00:58:50,743
I'm glad thee's back.
I've missed thee.

633
00:58:50,743 --> 00:58:51,978
I've missed thee.

634
00:58:51,978 --> 00:58:53,746
Come, thee must be hungry.

635
00:58:53,746 --> 00:58:57,739
- Where's Mattie?
- She'll be back soon.

636
00:58:58,751 --> 00:59:02,222
Where'd thee get this horse?

637
00:59:02,222 --> 00:59:04,190
Thee kept thy word.

638
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:08,183
Thee got rid of Red Rover.

639
00:59:08,661 --> 00:59:12,654
Glad to see you.

640
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,534
Is this horse well?

641
00:59:14,534 --> 00:59:16,703
There's nothing to fear on that score.

642
00:59:16,703 --> 00:59:19,806
She's not much to look at.
But if thee doesn't mind that...

643
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:20,974
Mind!

644
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:24,077
This is the very horse
I've been praying for.

645
00:59:24,077 --> 00:59:28,070
A good, plain animal that won't fill
every man on the pike with racing ideas.

646
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:32,118
Lady'll discourage racing ideas,
I promise thee.

647
00:59:32,118 --> 00:59:34,020
Come in.
Thee must be starved.

648
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:36,522
We haven't had a good meal
since we left.

649
00:59:36,522 --> 00:59:38,124
I'll be in in a minute.

650
00:59:38,124 --> 00:59:42,117
I'll help thee unhitch, Enoch.

651
00:59:48,134 --> 00:59:51,604
This looks like the place.

652
00:59:51,604 --> 00:59:52,772
Hello, there!

653
00:59:52,772 --> 00:59:56,765
Good evening.
Certainly is good to see you again.

654
00:59:57,310 --> 01:00:00,580
Here we are.

655
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:01,981
Good evening.

656
01:00:01,981 --> 01:00:05,852
You know, it is certainly
a pleasure to see you.

657
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,920
This is a joy I've been waiting for.

658
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,155
I offer you...

659
01:00:09,155 --> 01:00:13,126
...my salutations, my felicitations
and my congratulations.

660
01:00:13,126 --> 01:00:14,761
What for?

661
01:00:14,761 --> 01:00:16,729
Why, ma'am, this organ.

662
01:00:16,729 --> 01:00:18,898
The world's finest!

663
01:00:18,898 --> 01:00:22,891
You've got a treat coming to you.
Just hold your breath.

664
01:00:23,169 --> 01:00:26,673
Now look at that.
Isn't that a beauty?

665
01:00:26,673 --> 01:00:30,666
Genuine walnut. Not an inch of
unornamented wood in the entire cabinet.

666
01:00:31,678 --> 01:00:34,847
Good evening, Brother Birdwell!
Hello, there.

667
01:00:34,847 --> 01:00:38,840
There must be some mistake.
This gentleman says thee's mixed up...

668
01:00:39,018 --> 01:00:40,687
...with this musical instrument.

669
01:00:40,687 --> 01:00:44,680
"Mixed" is scarcely the word for it.
It's gone beyond courting to marriage.

670
01:00:44,957 --> 01:00:46,759
Your husband...

671
01:00:46,759 --> 01:00:50,752
Thy husband is now the proud
and lucky owner of a Payson and Clarke.

672
01:00:51,831 --> 01:00:55,824
This organ. This substitute on earth
for choiring angels.

673
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,740
Father Birdwell, why keep
the lady in suspense?

674
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:04,010
You just give me a hand
and we'll get it inside.

675
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:07,647
We must step delicately.
My wife is a Quaker minister.

676
01:01:07,647 --> 01:01:11,217
You may know all about
Quaker ministers, but I know women.

677
01:01:11,217 --> 01:01:14,587
What a woman wants is a good,
firm hand and a strong voice.

678
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:18,580
Not Eliza.

679
01:01:19,392 --> 01:01:21,761
Wait until you hear your husband...

680
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,996
...when he seats himself
at this console.

681
01:01:23,996 --> 01:01:27,100
You know, you are married to an artist.

682
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:31,037
I forbid thee to have this instrument!

683
01:01:31,037 --> 01:01:34,240
"Forbid"?

684
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,233
For thy own sake, I forbid.

685
01:01:38,711 --> 01:01:40,613
When thee asks...

686
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:42,215
...or suggests...

687
01:01:42,215 --> 01:01:44,317
...l'm like putty in thy hands.

688
01:01:44,317 --> 01:01:48,310
But when thee forbids,
thee is barking up the wrong tree.

689
01:01:49,389 --> 01:01:52,158
- Come on, Quigley.
- I don't know what's come over thee.

690
01:01:52,158 --> 01:01:56,151
Bringing a thing like this here.
And me a recorded minister!

691
01:01:59,365 --> 01:02:03,358
Thee order that instrument back
to where it came from.

692
01:02:04,771 --> 01:02:08,764
I bought it and I'm going to keep it.

693
01:02:13,045 --> 01:02:15,381
I don't know what's come over thee.

694
01:02:15,381 --> 01:02:16,783
I'm warning thee...

695
01:02:16,783 --> 01:02:19,283
...if thee takes that instrument
into the house, I go out.
