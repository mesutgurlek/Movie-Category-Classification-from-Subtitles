1
00:03:46,943 --> 00:03:50,743
He's dead

2
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:56,342
And now it's my turn

3
00:03:57,253 --> 00:04:02,850
I'm leaving this world

4
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:10,129
I'm leaving my memories

5
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,928
I see...

6
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,138
I see the kid

7
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:25,737
kid that I was

8
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:30,651
I see...

9
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,038
What are you doing out here?

10
00:04:52,141 --> 00:04:55,542
Oh, I've been hired to escort
this one out to his uncle's

11
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:57,237
Parents can't handle
him no more

12
00:04:57,347 --> 00:05:01,147
You ask me, he was left too long
to suckle on a negro pap

13
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,151
His uncle's got a ranch
in a town called Palomito

14
00:05:04,253 --> 00:05:07,347
Maybe he can put some
starch in the boy

15
00:06:03,846 --> 00:06:06,838
I'm the uncle
Give me the money, sir

16
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,144
The money...
Here's your damned money!

17
00:06:09,252 --> 00:06:11,743
- It's all yours
- It's not damned money

18
00:06:11,854 --> 00:06:14,345
- It's money blessed by God
- Go to hell!

19
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,947
Vermine!

20
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:18,053
Salete!

21
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:20,459
Est- ce qu'il y a tout I'argent
la- dedans?

22
00:06:20,563 --> 00:06:23,930
Et toi la? Je t'aurais garde un chien
de ma chienne la!

23
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:26,925
Qu'est- ce que tu regardes la?
Allez viens donc...

24
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:29,527
Allez. On s'en va

25
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,636
T'es venu la pour
travailler, la!

26
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:34,039
T'es pas venu pour te
chercher belle donc

27
00:06:35,244 --> 00:06:37,542
Salete! Vermine la!

28
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,342
Mais c'est pas la niece
que j'ai demande, mon fils!

29
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:41,644
Lache- moi le sac!
T'as qu'a le faire toi!

30
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:42,649
Quoi?

31
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:46,449
Mais je vais te... taper!
Fous- moi le camp de la!

32
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:47,352
Va-t'en!

33
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:49,152
- Arrete!
- Va-t'en, sale

34
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:53,957
Je vais te casser la calebasse!
Que je vais te demolir, ordure!

35
00:06:54,063 --> 00:07:00,127
Vas- y, mon frere
Bougre, le poteau! Allez!Tiens!

36
00:08:22,051 --> 00:08:24,246
What took you so long?

37
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:28,353
Well I'm in charge at the ranch and
my uncle... Je veux dire...

38
00:08:28,457 --> 00:08:29,856
What's your name?

39
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,954
Quoi? Mon nom, c'est Mike

40
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:35,462
Where are you from?

41
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:38,125
J'suis un Cajun, La Louisiane

42
00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:40,634
Oh... Louisiana!

43
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,339
This is your first time

44
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:49,042
No

45
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:55,344
Yes, it is!

46
00:08:57,553 --> 00:08:59,544
Yes, it is

47
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:02,053
No

48
00:09:49,038 --> 00:09:50,630
Do you believe in God?

49
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,639
I don't know
Do you?

50
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,648
Today I do

51
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:09,054
My Mama gave it to me

52
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:17,027
Madeleine

53
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:25,832
Come here
Come here

54
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:30,334
We can go just the two of us
Toi et moi...

55
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:45,854
Sorry to break up the party

56
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:53,528
Leave me alone, Wally
I ain't working tonight

57
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:57,731
Doing virgins now, are we?

58
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:06,739
Don't be that way

59
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,246
I've been riding
all day long darling

60
00:11:10,353 --> 00:11:12,947
just to get here and see you

61
00:11:14,156 --> 00:11:15,851
Wally, please

62
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,060
Go Go away!

63
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:26,626
You wanna see
how a man does it?

64
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:29,728
Go Go, Mike
He'll kill you!

65
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,238
You don't wanna die over
no whore, Mikee?

66
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:35,936
- Now get the hell out of here
- I stay

67
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:40,341
- Please, no, stop it!
- It's time to go!

68
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,825
Do you believe in God?

69
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:19,526
Madeleine
would you come with me?

70
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:24,633
I have money

71
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:33,740
( You were right)

72
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:38,149
( I don't think he understands
what happened to him)

73
00:15:38,253 --> 00:15:41,245
(He's fighting hard against it)

74
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,927
(He's not ready yet)

75
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,648
(The spirit of the plants)

76
00:18:57,753 --> 00:19:00,449
( can teach you)

77
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:04,253
( the secrets of life)

78
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:52,427
Runi

79
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:13,544
(''Broken nose'')

80
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:26,025
( If one day you decide to
know yourself )

81
00:21:26,435 --> 00:21:30,531
(you'll have to choose
the warrior's path )

82
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,643
( You'll reach
the darkness of your spirit)

83
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:47,447
(Then, if you overcome
your fears)

84
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,547
(you will know who you are)

85
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:04,048
Hey, Rolling Star!

86
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:06,659
You'd better feed him somehow

87
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:13,631
- Got time for a drink?
- Yeah, you know me

88
00:24:13,735 --> 00:24:16,226
- Billy!
- Don't worry Billy

89
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:18,638
I'll take him

90
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,737
Do you mind building me one?

91
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:27,344
Here. How do you think your
little chat with Sullivan will go?

92
00:24:27,449 --> 00:24:29,041
Well, we'll see

93
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:30,550
You know, the town's starting to
hum

94
00:24:30,652 --> 00:24:35,146
They say there's more gold in them
mountains than in all California

95
00:24:35,257 --> 00:24:37,350
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of

96
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,133
Damn Jimmy!

97
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,431
- Goddamn butcher!
- Help!

98
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:52,837
Damn Jimmy, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

99
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:54,340
You're my deputy now

100
00:24:54,442 --> 00:24:56,137
This dentist prick tried
to kill me!

101
00:24:56,244 --> 00:25:00,340
Put him down!
Put him down, I said

102
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:01,743
Please

103
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,647
Do it

104
00:25:04,953 --> 00:25:05,942
What do you think you're doing?

105
00:25:06,054 --> 00:25:08,955
You can't go throwing people
through windows!

106
00:25:09,057 --> 00:25:10,547
We're the damn law

107
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:13,253
I quit, 'cause he deserves it!

108
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:15,261
You'd better rein in
that temper of yours

109
00:25:15,363 --> 00:25:16,921
Where's my tooth?

110
00:25:17,732 --> 00:25:20,724
- Sir, you're all right, sir?
- I'm all right, it's a miracle

111
00:25:20,835 --> 00:25:22,735
Don't worry, you'll be paid for
that busted window

112
00:25:22,837 --> 00:25:24,429
Ok, Thank you

113
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:28,532
Cause I'm docking it
out of your pay

114
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,538
- Well Now, what about that drink?
- Yeah

115
00:25:32,647 --> 00:25:33,636
Sounds good to me

116
00:25:33,748 --> 00:25:35,943
No sir, you're gonna simmer down

117
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:38,952
and you're gonna keep a watch
on things now!

118
00:25:40,755 --> 00:25:43,155
- Can you put that back in?
- Yes

119
00:25:43,258 --> 00:25:45,158
You couldn't take
this one out, could you?

120
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:05,345
I think we have to
climb that hill

121
00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:12,448
You go on ahead
I ain't fixing to die

122
00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:35,039
Pleased to meet you

123
00:26:37,045 --> 00:26:40,947
Looking for those damned
Sacred Mountains, huh?

124
00:26:54,162 --> 00:26:58,826
Father Del Rio, may you be
blessed in heaven!

125
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,029
What was that?

126
00:27:06,141 --> 00:27:08,041
Prosit

127
00:27:12,747 --> 00:27:14,738
What was that again?

128
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:21,547
Woodhead, I said you are
a pessimist and I am an optimist

129
00:27:22,357 --> 00:27:25,053
You've got to have faith, my friend

130
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,452
I don't have faith in
no one but me

131
00:27:29,264 --> 00:27:31,129
me and old Betty

132
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,930
I promised you gold
I'll give you mountains of gold

133
00:27:35,337 --> 00:27:37,828
They're so close
I can almost smell it

134
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,734
Well, let's get a move on

135
00:27:42,344 --> 00:27:45,336
Yeah well today is
maybe not a good day

136
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:46,937
What do you mean not a good day?

137
00:27:47,148 --> 00:27:50,242
Well, you know
tomorrow maybe we come back

138
00:27:50,652 --> 00:27:52,745
What do you mean tomorrow?

139
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,950
I've got to

140
00:28:02,364 --> 00:28:05,424
Anyway one of us must live

141
00:28:20,348 --> 00:28:22,942
Mike the Conqueror!

142
00:28:24,853 --> 00:28:28,345
I told you that horse
won't listen to anybody but me

143
00:28:36,264 --> 00:28:39,631
Easy. Easy

144
00:28:39,734 --> 00:28:41,133
Easy, boy

145
00:28:49,043 --> 00:28:51,739
Hey, hey! You're not gonna
win him like that

146
00:29:03,858 --> 00:29:06,656
- Wait, you're stuck
- What?

147
00:29:06,761 --> 00:29:08,956
You're stuck to me

148
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:28,247
I'd thought you would've done
better than that

149
00:29:31,252 --> 00:29:34,744
Boys, finish them gates!
Marshal!

150
00:29:35,657 --> 00:29:37,147
Sullivan

151
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,552
That's a hard ride

152
00:29:41,463 --> 00:29:44,227
What are you doing
round here, Marshall?

153
00:29:44,332 --> 00:29:46,027
Interested in one of my horses?

154
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:49,326
I heard back in town
that your hand Woodhead

155
00:29:49,437 --> 00:29:50,927
and that Prussian

156
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,236
are crossing the border
on to Chiricahua territory

157
00:29:57,145 --> 00:29:59,340
I don't know anything about that

158
00:29:59,447 --> 00:30:03,645
I'll tell you though that
I've send Woodhead up to Riata

159
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:05,446
to sell some of my horses

160
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:09,045
A pair of mules
holding digging tools?

161
00:30:09,858 --> 00:30:12,554
You're accusing me
of something, Marshall?

162
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:17,028
I know about the Prosit's map
to them damned mountains

163
00:30:17,532 --> 00:30:22,128
And believe me
it ain't nothing but bullshit

164
00:30:23,338 --> 00:30:27,035
Well people around here talk
you know that

165
00:30:27,442 --> 00:30:31,435
I know that
But what you should know

166
00:30:31,546 --> 00:30:34,447
is that anyone crossing the border
is breaking the law

167
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:36,744
Is that a fact?

168
00:30:40,955 --> 00:30:44,152
You shouldn't get caught up
in this nonsense, Greg

169
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,658
You don't wanna
loose what you got

170
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,059
Father, we should get going

171
00:31:25,733 --> 00:31:27,132
What you want?

172
00:31:28,336 --> 00:31:33,330
Well right now, all we want
is somethin' to eat

173
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,335
Where's the manuscript?

174
00:32:44,445 --> 00:32:46,640
The Del Rio manuscript

175
00:32:46,748 --> 00:32:47,737
No have

176
00:32:47,849 --> 00:32:52,047
Don't play dumb with me, because
I know your magic, Indian Witch

177
00:32:53,655 --> 00:32:55,555
Prosit took it

178
00:32:57,258 --> 00:32:58,748
Prosit took it

179
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,657
Don't be afraid

180
00:33:01,162 --> 00:33:03,528
I don't kill animals

181
00:33:39,734 --> 00:33:41,429
Where did you get this?

182
00:33:43,337 --> 00:33:45,828
My Mama gave it to me

183
00:33:50,745 --> 00:33:53,043
And this one here?

184
00:33:53,147 --> 00:33:56,344
I bet a pretty Indian girl
gave it to you

185
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,549
How do you know that?

186
00:34:03,658 --> 00:34:06,456
Why else would you spend
so much time in the mountains?

187
00:34:56,043 --> 00:34:57,135
(''Broken nose''! )

188
00:34:57,645 --> 00:34:59,943
(Where is Runi? )

189
00:35:00,047 --> 00:35:01,344
( Over there! )

190
00:35:01,449 --> 00:35:03,349
(Thanks, my pretty ones)

191
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,648
( See you later! )

192
00:35:30,945 --> 00:35:32,640
(''Broken nose'')

193
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,743
( Are you joining us? )

194
00:35:48,162 --> 00:35:53,429
( I met a white psychic

195
00:35:53,534 --> 00:35:55,525
(He steals people's souls)

196
00:35:55,636 --> 00:35:57,627
( I must heal her
I must do it right away )

197
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,536
(Then she'll be free)

198
00:36:01,342 --> 00:36:04,834
(Would you leave us now? )

199
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:12,943
(We will talk later )

200
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,260
( Your demons are stronger
than ever )

201
00:38:03,331 --> 00:38:07,427
(They will soon reappear )

202
00:38:09,437 --> 00:38:11,234
(Now is not the time)

203
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:12,931
( I haven't come here)

204
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,531
( to listen to your sermons)

205
00:38:18,145 --> 00:38:20,136
( I know what you wish

206
00:38:20,247 --> 00:38:22,545
( to speak to me about)

207
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,244
(The Sacred Mountains)

208
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:29,250
(There's an expedition
They're looking for gold)

209
00:38:29,357 --> 00:38:31,052
( from the Sacred Mountains)

210
00:38:31,459 --> 00:38:33,051
(They have a map )

211
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,929
(No )

212
00:38:38,032 --> 00:38:40,432
(There is another man )

213
00:38:40,534 --> 00:38:42,434
(The one she met)

214
00:38:42,536 --> 00:38:45,130
(He is not seeking gold)

215
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,230
(What are you worried about? )

216
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,835
(What's he seeking? )

217
00:38:50,444 --> 00:38:53,436
(The sacred power )

218
00:39:13,134 --> 00:39:15,329
( Our secret is threatened)

219
00:39:16,037 --> 00:39:18,335
(He knows)

220
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,734
Hey Mike!

221
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,542
Hi Pete!

222
00:41:07,948 --> 00:41:09,438
What are you doing here?

223
00:41:11,352 --> 00:41:13,547
What does it look like I'm doing?

224
00:41:16,257 --> 00:41:18,248
Now you two are starting
resembling an old married couple

225
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:20,259
Mr. and Mrs Marshal!

226
00:41:20,361 --> 00:41:24,525
Why don't I take you upstairs and
show you what kind of woman I am?

227
00:41:25,332 --> 00:41:27,527
Too much of a woman for me!

228
00:41:28,636 --> 00:41:30,228
Come on here

229
00:41:47,354 --> 00:41:49,845
Playing good tonight, boys?

230
00:41:50,457 --> 00:41:52,652
How about a song?

231
00:43:28,756 --> 00:43:30,656
Chiricahuas!

232
00:43:38,232 --> 00:43:39,426
What happened?

233
00:43:41,235 --> 00:43:42,224
Where's Woodhead?

234
00:43:42,336 --> 00:43:44,736
Er ist tot
He is dead!

235
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:46,931
Look what they did to me!

236
00:43:48,142 --> 00:43:51,043
You were told not to go
on their territory

237
00:43:51,245 --> 00:43:53,236
We were on the road to Riata

238
00:43:53,647 --> 00:43:55,547
They attacked us

239
00:43:55,649 --> 00:43:58,550
Well, they've killed
one of our own!

240
00:43:59,253 --> 00:44:01,448
What are you gonna do
about that, Marshal?

241
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:04,149
We can't just sit around here
with our tails between our legs

242
00:44:04,258 --> 00:44:08,058
while they try to fence us
in from all sides!

243
00:44:17,137 --> 00:44:19,037
You're a southpaw, huh?

244
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,638
Was?

245
00:44:22,142 --> 00:44:24,337
Ain't you left handed?

246
00:44:25,946 --> 00:44:27,743
You say I'm lying?

247
00:44:28,449 --> 00:44:31,441
You think I sit on a horse
and do this myself?

248
00:44:31,552 --> 00:44:32,746
And it must have hurt

249
00:44:32,853 --> 00:44:35,344
I am a Prussian Officer!

250
00:44:35,656 --> 00:44:39,649
The Von Luckner family is well
respected in Germany for many years

251
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,558
I'm a man of science
a geologist

252
00:44:42,663 --> 00:44:44,528
I make maps

253
00:44:45,032 --> 00:44:46,829
I've never seen
anything like this!

254
00:44:47,334 --> 00:44:49,131
The whole world's gone mad!

255
00:44:49,737 --> 00:44:53,434
Maybe...
but I'll find out what happened

256
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,531
You can bet on that

257
00:44:57,344 --> 00:45:00,142
Maybe you're not the right man
for the job, Marshal

258
00:45:00,247 --> 00:45:02,044
It's our land!

259
00:45:10,157 --> 00:45:12,557
You ruined my song

260
00:45:14,762 --> 00:45:18,323
A round of drinks on the house
in Woodhead's memory!

261
00:45:31,745 --> 00:45:34,543
She's got cojones
as big as a bull's!

262
00:45:38,752 --> 00:45:42,347
To Woodhead!
May God grant you vengeance!

263
00:45:45,459 --> 00:45:48,155
Sullivan, I found the mountains
I can...

264
00:45:48,862 --> 00:45:50,921
Sullivan, you still need me!

265
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,923
Maybe not

266
00:46:15,556 --> 00:46:17,547
What are you looking at?

267
00:46:28,435 --> 00:46:30,130
Move!

268
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:58,620
Who did this?

269
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:02,031
You, tell me
What happened?

270
00:47:02,536 --> 00:47:06,336
- Tell me, you son of a bitch
- Ultimadamente, Marshal

271
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,040
de que lado esta?

272
00:47:14,948 --> 00:47:17,542
Are you sure you don't
want me to go with you?

273
00:47:17,951 --> 00:47:20,943
No. I need you here

274
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:25,350
You know if Woodhead and that Prussian
did travel into their territory

275
00:47:25,459 --> 00:47:27,950
you may not get the welcome
you're used to

276
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:31,520
Jimmy

277
00:47:33,534 --> 00:47:36,526
I'll be back in a couple of days
And Jimmy

278
00:47:36,637 --> 00:47:40,437
you better keep your eyes peeled
till Rolling Star relieves you

279
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:45,139
Yes, sir Marshal
Sir Marshal, Marshal

280
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:51,947
Damned Cajun!

281
00:47:53,153 --> 00:47:55,348
Go back to your squaw, boy!

282
00:48:01,662 --> 00:48:04,028
Get out of here, Indian!

283
00:48:10,337 --> 00:48:12,931
Bye, you Indian lover!

284
00:48:44,938 --> 00:48:48,430
( I didn't kill him
He's a victim of a vengeance)

285
00:48:48,542 --> 00:48:52,638
( A white man says
he was attacked)

286
00:48:52,746 --> 00:48:55,544
( On his way to Riata)

287
00:49:01,655 --> 00:49:04,146
( It's the scalp of
the black man )

288
00:49:04,257 --> 00:49:07,454
(He was headed
for the Sacred Mountains)

289
00:49:07,561 --> 00:49:09,859
( I'm taking him to Runi)

290
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:13,331
(Runi is not one of us
The body belongs to us)

291
00:49:13,433 --> 00:49:16,834
( I'm taking him to Runi)

292
00:49:33,153 --> 00:49:34,950
( I'm not your enemy )

293
00:49:35,756 --> 00:49:37,553
( I'm not your enemy )

294
00:49:45,832 --> 00:49:46,821
( Go ahead! )

295
00:49:46,933 --> 00:49:48,525
( Chiricahua, kill me! )

296
00:49:48,635 --> 00:49:50,830
( Go ahead! )

297
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,240
It's a hot one
ain't it, Sheriff?

298
00:51:02,342 --> 00:51:03,934
Yeah

299
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:12,245
I'm looking for
a good friend of mine

300
00:51:13,553 --> 00:51:15,248
His name is Prosit

301
00:51:15,355 --> 00:51:19,155
I reckon you'll find him
over at the Venus Hotel

302
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:27,528
All right
Many thanks

303
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:36,336
Prosit, huh?

304
00:51:38,445 --> 00:51:40,743
Come on Billy
get me over to the saloon, quick!

305
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:43,543
Hey sheriff
we got a wounded one!

306
00:51:46,753 --> 00:51:52,248
Holy Mother of God!
Woodhead?

307
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,951
Prosit

308
00:51:55,962 --> 00:51:57,827
Where's Prosit?

309
00:51:57,931 --> 00:52:00,525
- what did you say?
- Prosit

310
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:08,437
I saw the mountains
you have the manuscript...

311
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,533
Sullivan's got it

312
00:52:13,146 --> 00:52:14,340
I'll have a drink

313
00:52:14,447 --> 00:52:19,146
Now Woody, look, come on
don't make me do anything rash

314
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:24,046
Come on, take me
back to the office

315
00:52:26,359 --> 00:52:28,554
Come on, come on!
Let's get Jimmy. Let's go

316
00:52:28,662 --> 00:52:30,220
And keep it straight!

317
00:52:33,033 --> 00:52:36,230
I was there
He was my partner

318
00:52:36,336 --> 00:52:37,530
We were like
blood brothers

319
00:52:37,637 --> 00:52:39,036
Woodhead

320
00:52:40,941 --> 00:52:42,636
Howdy Pete

321
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:45,938
Yes?

322
00:52:47,547 --> 00:52:49,742
I'm looking for a man
named Prosit

323
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:53,149
Woodhead!
It's a miracle!

324
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,448
So both of us will live!

325
00:52:56,857 --> 00:53:00,258
I know what you're gonna say
but look what they did to me

326
00:53:08,535 --> 00:53:12,835
They scalped me
and left me to die

327
00:53:15,242 --> 00:53:16,732
I begged

328
00:53:17,644 --> 00:53:22,343
I prayed to God to give me
the strength to make it back

329
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:26,945
so I could kill you

330
00:53:56,249 --> 00:53:58,046
Drop the gun!

331
00:54:03,456 --> 00:54:06,755
I said drop the gun!

332
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:12,425
You heard the man

333
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:32,243
You can't leave me
in the same cell!

334
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:34,149
He's a killer

335
00:54:37,157 --> 00:54:39,057
you're breaking my heart!

336
00:54:42,562 --> 00:54:45,122
And I thought that
we were partners

337
00:54:46,933 --> 00:54:51,632
Wally, my friend!
I thought you were dead

338
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:58,134
It seems
you've been very busy, Prosit

339
00:54:58,244 --> 00:55:01,441
What matters is that
you're alive, partner

340
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,450
Where's the manuscript?

341
00:55:05,852 --> 00:55:08,548
- Manuscript?
- the manuscript

342
00:55:08,655 --> 00:55:12,955
Ah, that manuscript!
Like the Del Rio manuscript?

343
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,221
Eh, I don't have it
But I know who's got it

344
00:55:18,331 --> 00:55:21,823
Yeah, I can take you to him

345
00:55:23,036 --> 00:55:26,631
We can find him right now
Well, we can't get out but...

346
00:55:27,941 --> 00:55:30,739
You know we can...
We are partners

347
00:55:31,544 --> 00:55:33,341
We are partners?

348
00:55:36,549 --> 00:55:38,449
It's good to see you, Wally

349
00:55:38,852 --> 00:55:40,547
Likewise

350
00:56:16,356 --> 00:56:17,948
The Marshal is here

351
00:56:27,834 --> 00:56:29,131
Yes

352
00:56:29,936 --> 00:56:32,029
Riata, was it?

353
00:56:39,045 --> 00:56:41,036
Yeah, Woodhead's dead

354
00:56:41,448 --> 00:56:43,348
But it wasn't the Chiricahua
that killed him

355
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:46,248
Some shooter came into town today
and finished the job

356
00:56:46,352 --> 00:56:49,446
He's sitting over there in your jail

357
00:57:01,534 --> 00:57:04,128
That man shuffles his feet

358
00:57:24,557 --> 00:57:25,854
What's wrong?

359
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:30,017
Well nothing's wrong, darling
Nothing

360
00:57:31,931 --> 00:57:35,128
Here, I'll take that
I'll take it

361
00:57:43,443 --> 00:57:44,842
What was that all about?

362
00:57:44,944 --> 00:57:49,142
Oh, just a friendly conversation
between two men

363
00:57:51,251 --> 00:57:53,048
Is that so?

364
00:57:55,255 --> 00:57:58,952
Well he sure left in an awful hurry
for it being so friendly

365
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:02,459
You're in love with him,
aren't you?

366
00:58:06,633 --> 00:58:08,225
Whose side are you on, darling?

367
00:58:08,334 --> 00:58:11,030
I didn't know I had to choose

368
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:15,337
Well, I'm on my side

369
00:58:54,747 --> 00:58:58,547
Hey, hombre!
Been real busy

370
00:58:58,651 --> 00:59:00,448
Got a full house in there

371
00:59:00,753 --> 00:59:01,947
I heard

372
00:59:19,539 --> 00:59:21,734
You gonna paint my portrait?

373
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:25,636
Hey, what's your name?

374
00:59:29,849 --> 00:59:34,047
Wallace Sebastian Blount

375
00:59:39,459 --> 00:59:41,950
Hey, stranger

376
00:59:42,962 --> 00:59:44,623
You got a light?

377
00:59:57,143 --> 01:00:00,135
Most folks used to call me Wally

378
01:00:03,549 --> 01:00:05,039
Wally

379
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:15,950
No, Wally!
Please no, stop it!

380
01:00:40,753 --> 01:00:41,845
Back off!

381
01:00:50,029 --> 01:00:51,621
Stop it!

382
01:01:05,445 --> 01:01:07,845
It won't be like it was before

383
01:01:12,352 --> 01:01:13,649
You want to see
how a man does it?

384
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,846
Go. Go, Mike!

385
01:01:41,748 --> 01:01:45,240
You don't wanna die over
no whore, Mikee?

386
01:02:37,937 --> 01:02:41,031
You son of a bitch
I thought you were dead

387
01:02:45,645 --> 01:02:47,044
I'll be damned

388
01:02:47,146 --> 01:02:50,047
You're fixing to shoot me
with my own gun!

389
01:02:53,252 --> 01:02:54,742
That ain't right

390
01:02:55,254 --> 01:02:57,347
You're the son of a bitch, Mike

391
01:02:57,457 --> 01:02:59,448
I guess maybe

392
01:03:00,059 --> 01:03:02,050
you never got over

393
01:03:05,731 --> 01:03:07,631
that thing what I did

394
01:03:07,733 --> 01:03:09,928
Fils de putain!

395
01:03:12,138 --> 01:03:15,733
In fact
you did me a favour

396
01:03:15,842 --> 01:03:18,936
I died, but I came back

397
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:22,742
And now, I'm heading for
the Sacred Mountains

398
01:03:27,854 --> 01:03:30,755
But first

399
01:03:30,857 --> 01:03:34,452
some truth, The same way
that you've done for me
