1
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:19,512
<i>Oh, listen</i>

2
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:26,394
<i>Listen well
Listen to the legend of Chuck-A-Luck</i>

3
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:27,687
Rancho Notorious

4
00:00:27,812 --> 00:00:31,691
<i>Listen to the song
of the gambler's wheel</i>

5
00:00:33,442 --> 00:00:36,529
<i>A souvenir from a bygone year</i>

6
00:00:36,654 --> 00:00:39,282
<i>Spinning a tale
of the old frontier</i>

7
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:42,577
<i>And a man of steel...</i>

8
00:00:42,702 --> 00:00:49,584
<i>And a passion that drove him
on and on and on</i>

9
00:00:51,627 --> 00:00:54,725
<i>It began, they say,</i>

10
00:00:54,926 --> 00:00:56,776
<i> one summer day</i>

11
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:03,389
<i>When the sun was blazing down</i>

12
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:08,769
<i>'Twas back in the early '70s</i>

13
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:15,026
<i>In a little Wyoming town</i>

14
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:19,113
<i>So listen to the legend
of Chuck-A-Luck</i>

15
00:01:19,238 --> 00:01:21,532
<i>Listen to the wheel of fate</i>

16
00:01:21,657 --> 00:01:27,330
<i>As round and round
with a whispering sound it spins</i>

17
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:33,336
<i>The old, old story of hate,</i>

18
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:39,133
<i>murder and revenge!</i>

19
00:01:52,698 --> 00:01:55,348
Nothing's better than that to
make a man agreeable.

20
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,456
Especially in the middle of the day.

21
00:01:58,938 --> 00:02:00,704
Why'd you come in town?
- To kiss you.

22
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:02,092
You oughn't be away.

23
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:04,997
Last calf I had an iron on
told me I could come.

24
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:07,203
- Vern...
- What?

25
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,990
When we get married...
- Eight days.

26
00:02:12,776 --> 00:02:15,920
And when we get the ranch...
- Eight years.

27
00:02:17,134 --> 00:02:19,924
- I found a name for it.
- Yeah? What is it?

28
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:23,141
Lost Cloud Ranch.
Pretty?

29
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:24,723
Pretty as you.

30
00:02:25,649 --> 00:02:26,922
Wow! Oh, Vern!

31
00:02:27,426 --> 00:02:29,767
Came from Paris in France, the man said.

32
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:32,566
Oh, it's beautiful for evening!

33
00:02:33,144 --> 00:02:34,629
Fine for stargazing.

34
00:02:36,137 --> 00:02:38,334
<i>Hey, Beth, where's everybody?</i>

35
00:02:38,454 --> 00:02:41,317
I was out at the back
and the folks yelled, "Coming, Tommy?"

36
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:44,781
And I couldn't make it right then.
They left!

37
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:48,771
Everybody's gone!
I got nothing to do.

38
00:02:48,891 --> 00:02:51,500
Do it outside. Go on, get out of here!

39
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:58,206
Where is everybody?
The roads to town are deserted.

40
00:02:58,326 --> 00:03:01,975
Didn't you hear?
The Burdens had triplets last night.

41
00:03:02,095 --> 00:03:06,151
The whole town went to see them.
I told Dad I'd keep the store.

42
00:03:07,048 --> 00:03:08,715
- Kids. We ought to have a lot of them.
-Yes

43
00:03:09,237 --> 00:03:10,555
One every August.

44
00:03:17,929 --> 00:03:18,973
See you tonight.

45
00:03:45,082 --> 00:03:46,125
Whitey ?

46
00:04:01,952 --> 00:04:03,329
You wait outside.

47
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:12,464
Mister, can I hold your horse?
- Get away from here.

48
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,513
Is there anything you'd like to see?

49
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:25,924
Yeah. I wanna see what's
in the assayer's safe.

50
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:31,066
Both of 'em.

51
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:32,635
The one over there too.

52
00:04:34,784 --> 00:04:36,767
Yes. Yes, all right.

53
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,011
Vern! Vern!

54
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:23,017
I saw him come out the store.
Then the other one fired at me.

55
00:06:23,137 --> 00:06:26,562
He shot at me, the fella
with the long white hair.

56
00:06:27,084 --> 00:06:29,256
White hair?
- The one that stayed outside.

57
00:06:50,515 --> 00:06:53,124
Vern, I don't know
how to tell you this.

58
00:06:54,105 --> 00:06:55,949
She wasn't spared anything.

59
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:01,862
Jim...

60
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:04,710
give me your gun.

61
00:07:28,992 --> 00:07:31,860
Place was empty.
Just a girl in a store.

62
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:34,314
<i>Sure looked easy.</i>

63
00:07:34,762 --> 00:07:37,204
Could've been, if you wouldn't chase
petticoat so much.

64
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,147
None of your business.

65
00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:42,283
It is this time. The whole town'll be
after us. You made sure of that.

66
00:07:42,403 --> 00:07:44,297
Let's move then. We're in this together.

67
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:46,971
Let's split it. I'll take
my chances alone from here on.

68
00:07:47,513 --> 00:07:49,291
We'll split it in Chuck-A-Luck
and not before.

69
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:14,899
The tracks lead south, Sheriff.
- It's Sioux country below here.

70
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:18,857
- What of it? Let's go!
- I didn't mind being deputised,

71
00:08:18,977 --> 00:08:22,707
but I don't wanna
be butchered by Indians.

72
00:08:23,148 --> 00:08:25,793
I'm turning back.
- That's my feeling, Sheriff.

73
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,159
I got 50 head of cattle to brand tomorrow.

74
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:31,753
That's all you worry about?
Are you all gutless?

75
00:08:32,343 --> 00:08:34,727
Come on, we're losing time.
- I'm sorry, son.

76
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,841
I've no authority
to head past this stream.

77
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:40,511
There'll be a warrant out for him.
- A warrant? For whom? What's his description?

78
00:08:41,096 --> 00:08:43,657
What if she was your wife?
Or your daughter?

79
00:08:43,777 --> 00:08:47,104
- This is as far as we go.
- I'll follow him alone.

80
00:08:47,224 --> 00:08:50,809
Don't be a fool!
You're a raw hand with a gun.

81
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:55,784
Never mind the advice. You've all done
your duty. You're burnin' to get home.

82
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,242
Be sure to tell everybody
how brave you were.

83
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:01,450
Get drunk tonight.
I hope you have good dreams.

84
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,714
???

85
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:11,513
I had to do it, that's all,
I've told you a dozen times.

86
00:09:14,044 --> 00:09:18,979
- What are you driving at?
- I said it before. I want my share now.

87
00:09:20,002 --> 00:09:22,846
I've said it before,
we'll split it at Chuck-A-Luck.

88
00:09:24,594 --> 00:09:26,775
Keep quiet about the girl
when we get there.

89
00:09:27,944 --> 00:09:30,729
Maybe I will, maybe I won't.
I'll do what I please.

90
00:09:33,082 --> 00:09:34,407
Rattlesnake! Look out!

91
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:03,803
The man who was with you,
where is he?

92
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,205
Water...

93
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:08,099
The man who was with you,
where is he?

94
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,193
Water. Water.

95
00:10:13,762 --> 00:10:16,058
Talk, or you don't get a drop.
Where'd he head?

96
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:18,693
Where did he head?

97
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:23,573
Chuck-A-Luck. Chuck-A-Luck.

98
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:29,120
Chuck-A-Luck?

99
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:35,669
<i>Where and what is
Chuck-A-Luck, Chuck-A-Luck?</i>

100
00:10:35,794 --> 00:10:40,966
<i>Nobody knows
and the dead won't tell</i>

101
00:10:41,883 --> 00:10:46,721
<i>So on and on, relentlessly,
this man pursues his quest</i>

102
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:50,281
<i>Through autumn and winter</i>

103
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:53,740
<i>Searching the great South West</i>

104
00:10:54,115 --> 00:10:59,109
<i>This thing that drives him
like a whip will never let him rest</i>

105
00:10:59,774 --> 00:11:01,918
<i>Night and day, early and late,</i>

106
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:06,204
<i>He looks for a place,
or a town or a face</i>

107
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,880
<i>And deep within him
burn the fires </i>

108
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,391
<i>of hate, murder</i>

109
00:11:14,511 --> 00:11:17,433
<i> and revenge!</i>

110
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:22,110
You're new around here, ain't you?

111
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,712
Just passing through.

112
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:26,677
Did you ever hear of a place
called Chuck-A-Luck?

113
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:32,638
Sure. Wheel of fortune.
At the Royal Flush, down the street.

114
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,762
Not gambling. You never heard of
any other Chuck-A-Luck?

115
00:11:35,882 --> 00:11:37,276
No, I sure ain't.

116
00:11:38,301 --> 00:11:41,151
Why don't you try asking
over at the courthouse?

117
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:44,592
Barber, get another bowl of water.
My face is dry.

118
00:11:44,712 --> 00:11:47,619
Water comes later...
- I want it now.

119
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:49,409
Sure... Excuse me.

120
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:56,302
Are you on the dodge?
- What of it?

121
00:11:56,844 --> 00:11:59,432
I wouldn't talk about Chuck-A-Luck
so free if I were you.

122
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:03,423
Why not?
Altar Keane wouldn't like it.

123
00:12:03,543 --> 00:12:04,720
and besides ???

124
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:08,255
Where'd you hear about Chuck-A-Luck,
why are you asking about it?

125
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,320
I'm supposed to meet somebody there.
- Who?

126
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,489
I don't know. It could be you.

127
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:16,936
Get back there, Barber!
- Yes, sir.

128
00:12:18,718 --> 00:12:22,454
You don't know so much,
but you're sure trying to learn!

129
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:21,876
How is he, Doc?
- He had lacerations and concussion.

130
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:24,552
His jugular vein was severed,

131
00:13:24,886 --> 00:13:28,168
he has broken ribs
and a fractured skull.

132
00:13:28,752 --> 00:13:31,027
To put it briefly, he's real dead.

133
00:13:32,508 --> 00:13:34,681
What makes you think he was an outlaw?

134
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,657
The way he acted.

135
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:39,047
Was it self-defence?

136
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:41,885
I saw his gun too.

137
00:13:42,936 --> 00:13:45,367
It used to be the finest barbershop
west of Baxter's Bridge.

138
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:50,276
Could this be him?
There's something around the eyes.

139
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:54,983
Sure, that's him. That's him
before I shaved his handlebars.

140
00:13:56,713 --> 00:13:59,055
"Wanted by the State of Texas

141
00:13:59,175 --> 00:14:03,832
"for robbery of a stagecoach
out of El Paso, July 25, 1873.

142
00:14:03,952 --> 00:14:06,754
"Reward, $300."
- Did it say July 25th?

143
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,423
Yeah, July 25th.

144
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:11,125
He couldn't have been
in Wyoming early in August.

145
00:14:11,245 --> 00:14:15,497
No, he couldn't have.
Apologies and congratulations.

146
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:19,317
The $300 is yours.
- Did you ever hear of Chuck-A-Luck?

147
00:14:19,437 --> 00:14:20,935
Yeah...
- A saloon....

148
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:23,479
A password?

149
00:14:24,308 --> 00:14:28,576
No, I never did. Here's your gun.

150
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,946
The reward - it'll be a few days.
- Give it to the barber.

151
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,533
That's sure kind of you.

152
00:14:34,653 --> 00:14:37,747
You did our job. The least
I can do is buy you a drink.

153
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:38,921
Wait a minute.

154
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:44,131
Did any of you ever hear of
someone called Altar Crane?

155
00:14:45,654 --> 00:14:50,851
- Altar Crane.
- The name sounds familar.

156
00:14:50,971 --> 00:14:53,301
Or Altar Keane?

157
00:14:53,628 --> 00:14:55,386
Yeah, I remember.

158
00:14:55,506 --> 00:14:57,275
If it's the person I'm thinking about,

159
00:14:57,671 --> 00:15:00,676
the name is Keane, not Crane.

160
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:03,186
Altar Keane, yeah!

161
00:15:04,454 --> 00:15:05,623
What are you laughing at?

162
00:15:06,061 --> 00:15:08,804
That name takes me back a long time,

163
00:15:08,924 --> 00:15:11,413
when I was mining ore
in a big boom town.

164
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:14,906
Well, one night,

165
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,072
it was a horse race,

166
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:23,080
only I was one of the horses
and Altar Keane was my jockey.

167
00:15:39,586 --> 00:15:41,778
Come on, come on!
You can make it!

168
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,581
That's the only Altar Keane I know!

169
00:16:48,093 --> 00:16:51,733
They only made one like her.
- What happened to her?

170
00:16:51,853 --> 00:16:54,796
- I never saw her after that.
- I've got to find her.

171
00:16:55,151 --> 00:16:56,257
Where would I look?

172
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:59,353
I heard she went to Virginia City.

173
00:16:59,473 --> 00:17:00,871
Try some of the saloons.

174
00:17:01,476 --> 00:17:04,737
She moved there with a girl
named Dolly,

175
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,392
a good friend of hers.

176
00:17:07,382 --> 00:17:09,103
I knew her well.

177
00:17:10,721 --> 00:17:14,984
When I met Altar, she'd just come
from the Eastern Seaboard.

178
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:17,695
She was a singer, you know.

179
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:22,867
She sang only
in the most elegant places.

180
00:17:24,448 --> 00:17:28,463
Loved horses.
Always had a pair of white horses.

181
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:33,055
And the men would all uncover
as she drove by.

182
00:17:33,827 --> 00:17:34,802
The women?

183
00:17:36,304 --> 00:17:41,682
The women would have been happy
for lightning to hit her.

184
00:17:42,204 --> 00:17:44,852
Let me tell you the kind of girl
Altar was.

185
00:17:45,418 --> 00:17:49,351
Lots of men.
Sure, that's her privilege.

186
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,354
She shut the door on a cattle baron

187
00:17:52,908 --> 00:17:55,328
if she had fancy for a cowpuncher.

188
00:17:56,831 --> 00:18:01,197
Yes, she was a glory girl
in those days.

189
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,738
Last I heard, she was in Tascosa

190
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,826
<i>at Baldy Gunder's place.</i>

191
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:14,284
You'll only find here,
young man, a shade of her.

192
00:18:14,764 --> 00:18:18,547
She left here six...
seven years ago.

193
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:22,431
It was just after the night
she met Frenchy Fairmont.

194
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:25,035
Faster on the draw
than a Mexican jack rabbit.

195
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:32,656
I don't swear it's true
because I wasn't here.

196
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:34,691
But here's the way they tell it.

197
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,861
The story runs that one night
Mr Gunder

198
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:44,761
didn't like the wayshe treated a patron.

199
00:18:45,074 --> 00:18:47,187
Or Altar didn't

200
00:18:47,307 --> 00:18:49,834
like the way
the patron treated her!

201
00:19:40,535 --> 00:19:42,622
Altar, you don't smile enough.

202
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:45,111
I'm sick of smiling.

203
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:48,077
I pay you to entertain people,
not to kick them.

204
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:50,910
Take your hands off me, Baldy.
- Sure, sure.

205
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:56,026
Nobody's gonna touch you, angel.
Nobody wants you around, either.

206
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,113
- You're fired.

207
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:07,105
Deductions for food
and costumes, $27.

208
00:20:07,752 --> 00:20:10,623
Deductions for leaving early
two nights, $10.

209
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:13,712
You haven't been shilling
very good lately, either.

210
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:16,284
I owe you $20 even.

211
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:18,997
You can look for yourself.
- Never mind.

212
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,376
Your word's
as good as your book.

213
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,298
Here's your $20.

214
00:20:25,497 --> 00:20:28,543
Thanks.
Lots of bad luck to you, Baldy.

215
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,230
Get out of my way.

216
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:37,198
Make your bets. Everybody down?
We're ready to spin.

217
00:20:37,511 --> 00:20:38,930
Wheel is spinning.
- Wait.

218
00:20:48,437 --> 00:20:50,691
Spin the wheel.
- Wheel is spinning.

219
00:21:03,702 --> 00:21:07,125
Three 4s on the red.
And we have a winner!

220
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,344
Here's a lady who's lucky.

221
00:21:14,464 --> 00:21:16,426
Everybody's lucky at Chuck-A-Luck.

222
00:21:16,989 --> 00:21:18,356
Step up and make your bets.

223
00:21:23,472 --> 00:21:24,703
Is everybody down?

224
00:21:25,997 --> 00:21:28,376
Spin the wheel.
- Wheel is spinning.

225
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:41,455
Three 4s on red wins again.

226
00:21:41,805 --> 00:21:43,422
Did the lady have that covered?

227
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:45,113
Yes, she did.

228
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:53,508
That idiot thinks she's shilling!

229
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:55,899
He didn't know you fired her...
- Shut up.

230
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:00,676
Stop the game!

231
00:22:01,344 --> 00:22:03,499
When I tell somebody
to get out, I mean it.

232
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:06,126
I don't work for you. I'm a customer.

233
00:22:06,606 --> 00:22:09,016
Don't lose your sense of humour, Altar.

234
00:22:09,768 --> 00:22:11,521
I stay here as long as I like.

235
00:22:14,647 --> 00:22:18,002
All right! Have one more spin,
then close up for the night.

236
00:22:19,152 --> 00:22:22,582
Try your luck at Chuck-A-Luck.
Everybody wins.

237
00:22:23,584 --> 00:22:25,003
Is everybody down?

238
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:27,904
Betting, Altar?

239
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,230
Sure.

240
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,886
Let her spin.

241
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,396
- Wheel is spin...
- I'll spin it.

242
00:22:47,292 --> 00:22:48,638
It's Frenchy Fairmont!

243
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:06,867
You win, ma'am.

244
00:23:17,336 --> 00:23:18,442
Pay the lady, please.

245
00:23:25,552 --> 00:23:26,825
It's all right. Pay her.

246
00:23:31,746 --> 00:23:33,154
This will help you carry it.

247
00:23:49,117 --> 00:23:50,108
There you are, ma'am.

248
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:54,207
May I be seeing you home?

249
00:23:55,219 --> 00:23:56,096
Yes

250
00:23:56,638 --> 00:23:58,581
Always a pleasure
to meet a good loser.

251
00:24:01,797 --> 00:24:03,112
Frenchy Fairmont.

252
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,006
They say you're
the fastest draw in the West.

253
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,351
The greatest ability
often consists in not showing.

254
00:24:10,102 --> 00:24:11,354
You're wanted, aren't you?

255
00:24:12,126 --> 00:24:13,922
Let's say I'm in public demand.

256
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:17,951
Why did you do that back there?

257
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:20,051
I'm sentimental.

258
00:24:23,068 --> 00:24:24,038
Are you?

259
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:27,485
I once saw three men fight
a gun battle over you.

260
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:30,832
All three were killed.
Abilene, wasn't it?

261
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:32,042
Yes.

262
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:37,019
<i>I was in Hayes City once when you rode
through a hotel lobby on a white horse.</i>

263
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:40,495
<i>Rode him up straight up the stairs
to the dining room.</i>

264
00:24:41,218 --> 00:24:43,242
You must have had quite
an important engagement.

265
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:45,405
It was with the mayor.

266
00:24:46,407 --> 00:24:51,376
Wherever I went, I seemed to see
Altar Keane or hear about her.

267
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,548
Why didn't you ever meet me?

268
00:24:55,184 --> 00:24:59,935
My engagements led me to other
parts of the West, toward Mexico.

269
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,456
I often wondered
what had become of you.

270
00:25:08,384 --> 00:25:10,158
You can stop feeling sorry for me.

271
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:16,803
You strike me as a wonderful
woman, Miss Keane. - Oh, stop it!

272
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,389
What are you gonna do
with all this money?

273
00:25:23,846 --> 00:25:26,152
For a moment, when I was winning,
I thought...

274
00:25:28,886 --> 00:25:31,091
I'd give it back.
- Why?

275
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:34,930
Baldy Gunder wouldn't let me out of
town alive with it.

276
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:37,122
This is my place.

277
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:39,834
Don't give it back.

278
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:42,923
There's a stage
south to Silver City in the morning.

279
00:25:43,653 --> 00:25:46,107
I'd be glad to offer you protection
until it leaves.

280
00:25:50,593 --> 00:25:51,783
I know you would.

281
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:00,937
All right,

282
00:26:02,315 --> 00:26:03,316
come in.

283
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:06,018
I will, ma'am. In the morning at nine,

284
00:26:06,728 --> 00:26:09,761
just before the stage leaves.
Goodnight.

285
00:26:15,805 --> 00:26:18,106
They say he stayed outside her place
that night,

286
00:26:18,226 --> 00:26:20,744
just in case Baldy showed up.

287
00:26:22,896 --> 00:26:25,218
The next morning,
he put her on the stage.

288
00:26:25,338 --> 00:26:27,237
That's how Altar left.

289
00:26:27,884 --> 00:26:31,397
With her gone, business
fell off at Baldy's Palace.

290
00:26:31,517 --> 00:26:32,696
Where did she go?

291
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:38,064
Young man, why are you
so interested in Altar Keane?

292
00:26:38,648 --> 00:26:40,365
I gotta find somebody through her.

293
00:26:40,485 --> 00:26:43,399
Wish I could help you
but I never heard of her any more.

294
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,760
I was told that, years later, she
met Frenchy again, near the border.

295
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:51,825
If you wanna believe what you hear,
there they might be now,

296
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:54,438
the two of them, snug and warm.

297
00:26:54,897 --> 00:26:59,542
I don't know how much of if it's true,
but it sure sounds romantic.

298
00:26:59,662 --> 00:27:01,712
Frenchy ain't so snug today.

299
00:27:02,409 --> 00:27:04,438
A mail rider came through today.

300
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:06,061
In case you don't know it,

301
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:10,495
Frenchy was caught and
locked up over in Gunsight last Thursday.

302
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:13,331
The best I hope for him

303
00:27:14,145 --> 00:27:15,585
is they hang him.

304
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:23,563
<i>Now the road that goes to Chuck-A-Luck
Leads to a western jail</i>

305
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,324
<i>And behind the bars is an outlaw</i>

306
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:29,016
<i>who knows the Chuck-A-Luck trail</i>

307
00:27:29,136 --> 00:27:34,369
<i>There's crooked politicians in the
very next cell, safely locked away</i>

308
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:36,563
<i>It's an angry town all closed down</i>

309
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:40,108
<i>to vote on election day</i>

310
00:27:41,151 --> 00:27:46,447
<i>But here's a man with a crazy plan,
a plan that will not wait</i>

311
00:27:46,573 --> 00:27:49,242
<i>He'll trick his way
inside that jail</i>

312
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:53,830
<i>To reach his goal of hate,</i>

313
00:27:53,955 --> 00:27:58,042
<i>murder and revenge!</i>

314
00:28:02,527 --> 00:28:04,595
You got a padded cell for this one, Sam?

315
00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:06,056
Shooting up the town on election day!

316
00:28:06,176 --> 00:28:08,206
With deputies roaming the streets!

317
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:11,068
How's the election coming?
- Law And Order's ahead.

318
00:28:11,188 --> 00:28:13,259
Why ain't you at the polls?

319
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:16,950
I'm making sure this rat
don't turn

320
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,173
those rats loose.

321
00:28:18,293 --> 00:28:20,477
What do you think?
- I don't know.

322
00:28:22,461 --> 00:28:23,797
Don't fret, gentlemen.

323
00:28:24,673 --> 00:28:27,928
It won't be the first time
they've hung a few crooked politicians.

324
00:28:28,721 --> 00:28:30,432
It'll only take a minute.

325
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:34,227
It's a clean way to die,
and as quiet as eating a banana.

326
00:28:38,267 --> 00:28:40,114
You've got no right to keep us there.

327
00:28:40,234 --> 00:28:42,979
- Sheriff, you got to protect us.
- Law And Order'll hang us;

328
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:45,968
- that's their platform.
- Shut up!

329
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,661
Where d'you want him put?
- Not with them!

330
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,098
I don't like men who swindled the town
they must close the saloon.

331
00:28:53,414 --> 00:28:54,771
Just about what I was saying.

332
00:28:56,189 --> 00:28:58,494
I bet you could bribe them
with a rusty nail.

333
00:29:01,137 --> 00:29:03,484
That's Frenchy Fairmont.
Rather be with him?

334
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:06,166
Sure, give me an outlaw rather
than these thieves any time.

335
00:29:06,187 --> 00:29:08,106
At least
he takes his chances in the open.

336
00:29:11,356 --> 00:29:12,843
You are welcome, sir.

337
00:29:12,963 --> 00:29:16,454
Sheriff, is there a chance
we might cash in our chips tonight?

338
00:29:16,816 --> 00:29:18,344
How about some whiskey up here?

339
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,536
You can't deny that to 'em,
Mr. Bullock.

340
00:29:20,656 --> 00:29:22,500
There'll be no lynching
while I'm around,

341
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,879
but it might them look a little
more like men. Send for three bottles.

342
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:28,259
What kind of
a Law And Order Party is this?

343
00:29:28,379 --> 00:29:31,046
I get jailed for trying to buy
a drink on election day

344
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:32,905
and they have it delivered to their door!

345
00:29:33,214 --> 00:29:35,823
You're right. Our party stands for
everybody alike.

346
00:29:36,386 --> 00:29:37,492
Whiskey for all of 'em.

347
00:29:38,118 --> 00:29:39,036
Sheriff...

348
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:45,142
Be sure it's my brand. Joe Gideon.

349
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,978
It'll take a little time.

350
00:29:56,588 --> 00:30:00,490
In Wyoming, I heard that no jail
had ever seen Frenchy Fairmont.

351
00:30:01,555 --> 00:30:03,662
I dropped into town to buy
a piece of merchandise.

352
00:30:04,205 --> 00:30:05,908
A bottle of perfume.
- Perfume?

353
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:10,394
For a lady.

354
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:12,729
<i>When I turned my back,</i>

355
00:30:13,466 --> 00:30:16,006
<i>the storekeeper hit me over the head
with an axe handle.</i>

356
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,790
Are you from Wyoming?
- Yeah.

357
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,111
Ever been in Wyoming?

358
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:24,221
No, I haven't.

359
00:30:25,076 --> 00:30:27,229
And I wouldn't be
surprised if I never will be.

360
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:29,655
Why not?

361
00:30:29,775 --> 00:30:34,272
If this election gets out of hand,
it may not be choosy.

362
00:30:35,483 --> 00:30:38,314
If they take our friends here,
they might take us along too,

363
00:30:39,274 --> 00:30:41,690
just for a few extra laughs.

364
00:30:43,647 --> 00:30:45,543
That's a comforting thought.
- Isn't it?

365
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:59,094
I had a fight with my ranch boss
at home and quit.

366
00:30:59,214 --> 00:31:02,134
So I took my back pay
and decided to see the land.

367
00:31:02,254 --> 00:31:04,986
Work your way down here?
- Yeah, a coupla weeks at a time.

368
00:31:06,215 --> 00:31:09,040
Trouble with me is
I usually lose what I make at poker,

369
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,840
but the other night I was lucky.

370
00:31:11,582 --> 00:31:13,152
I closed my eyes

371
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:16,530
and threw my last 20 £ gold piece
on a Chuck-A-Luck number.

372
00:31:17,219 --> 00:31:18,640
And, so help me, I hit!

373
00:31:19,141 --> 00:31:22,146
Yeah, a man can get mighty fortunate
at a Chuck-a-Luck wheel.

374
00:31:22,898 --> 00:31:26,928
When I wanna do a little skylarking,
I come to a town that's shut up tight.

375
00:31:27,048 --> 00:31:28,827
You took your time about it!

376
00:31:28,947 --> 00:31:32,323
Couldn't find
your particular brand right away...

377
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:34,577
- The town is..
- Never mind about that.

378
00:31:35,308 --> 00:31:37,295
Drink your whiskey
and be glad you got it.

379
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:47,075
Drink it fast. The final returns...
- I told you, never mind!

380
00:31:59,211 --> 00:32:01,451
That dirty, double-crossing sheriff!

381
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:03,724
Not a thing but whiskey!

382
00:32:03,844 --> 00:32:05,119
What did you expect to find?

383
00:32:06,684 --> 00:32:08,610
Empty your bottles!
Empty them fast!

384
00:32:09,793 --> 00:32:13,591
Empty it!
Come on, Cowboy!

385
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:19,649
That's it! That's it!
- Give it to me.

386
00:32:22,588 --> 00:32:23,808
What would you say that was?

387
00:32:24,341 --> 00:32:25,598
I'd say it was a pick.

388
00:32:25,718 --> 00:32:27,956
The sheriff and these boys
work real well together.

389
00:32:28,076 --> 00:32:30,964
Young man, can't we talk this over?
- How much would you take for that?

390
00:32:31,084 --> 00:32:32,649
We'll free you.

391
00:32:35,924 --> 00:32:38,470
Polls are closed.
I have the latest count.

392
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:42,120
Citizens' Party - 119 votes.

393
00:32:42,767 --> 00:32:45,323
Law And Order - 1,540.

394
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:54,059
Dad says we all meet later
at the Big Dipper Saloon.

395
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,299
Gentlemen, say your prayers.

396
00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:04,799
Cowboy, I'll give you $1,000.
- I'd double that.

397
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:07,244
$3,000. Hand it over! Give it here.

398
00:33:07,364 --> 00:33:10,056
You heard him... 3000

399
00:33:17,455 --> 00:33:19,923
Let us out! $5,000! $5,000!

400
00:33:20,043 --> 00:33:22,109
5000 $. Do you hear me?

401
00:33:23,132 --> 00:33:24,890
They're all getting drunk
over at the Dipper.

402
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:28,013
What are you doing here?
The election threw you out of office.

403
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:29,785
I wanna clean my desk out.

404
00:33:30,954 --> 00:33:32,587
Go ahead. Then get outta here.

405
00:33:32,707 --> 00:33:35,681
They talking of lynching over there.
You gonna let that crowd take 'em?

406
00:33:38,538 --> 00:33:41,544
All right, I'll go and make
a speech at 'em. You stay here.

407
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:59,060
Bill, help me with this drawer.
It's stuck.

408
00:34:14,824 --> 00:34:17,328
The horses are in the back!
- Watch out! Fairmont's loose!

409
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:23,063
Come on.

410
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:47,838
Put up your hands!

411
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:54,657
That's very sensible of you..

412
00:34:55,575 --> 00:34:56,963
Go find the horses.

413
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:11,987
Wait a minute, gentlemen.

414
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:20,892
You'll have to walk out of town.

415
00:35:22,478 --> 00:35:25,045
If you want my advice, you'll run.

416
00:35:41,256 --> 00:35:43,410
Whoa! Wait here for me.

417
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:44,912
What are you stopping for?

418
00:35:46,274 --> 00:35:47,882
What I came to town for.

419
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,930
After the war, I decided
to settle in Missouri.

420
00:36:19,493 --> 00:36:22,056
What brought you out West?
- A bullet.

421
00:36:22,553 --> 00:36:24,286
A bullet I put in a rancher,

422
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,649
another man
who had his own personal sheriff

423
00:36:27,788 --> 00:36:30,001
Cheated me out of a homestead.
and called it law.

424
00:36:30,971 --> 00:36:32,669
I met him in a corral.

425
00:36:32,789 --> 00:36:36,525
He had the jump, but hate made
me fast. He went down like a stone.

426
00:36:37,506 --> 00:36:39,760
I wasn't sorry, but I had
to leave there in a hurry.

427
00:36:40,553 --> 00:36:42,927
Then I got a rep for being a fast gun.

428
00:36:43,631 --> 00:36:46,036
I kept meeting with
cowpunchers full of booze,

429
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,184
or trigger-crazy gunfighters.

430
00:36:48,934 --> 00:36:51,496
I'd ride into a town
and have to shoot my way out.

431
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,416
Seems that's how it went.

432
00:36:54,877 --> 00:36:56,442
Must be a lonely trail.

433
00:36:57,605 --> 00:36:59,076
You don't make many friends.

434
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:07,442
There'll be a warrant out for you.
Ever happened before?

435
00:37:07,562 --> 00:37:09,256
First time I ever had a warrant myself.

436
00:37:09,736 --> 00:37:12,101
First time I've been a horse thief!

437
00:37:12,449 --> 00:37:14,671
Would you mind a bed
with springs on it tonight?

438
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,709
They grow on cactus around here?

439
00:37:17,043 --> 00:37:19,485
Not exactly. Down there.

440
00:37:27,308 --> 00:37:30,501
If you're not headed anywhere, maybe
you care to side with me for a while.

441
00:37:30,984 --> 00:37:33,113
There's something I have to attend to,

442
00:37:34,302 --> 00:37:36,374
but that can wait. Lead the way.

443
00:37:56,171 --> 00:37:57,944
Hiya, Frenchy.
- Hi, Harbin.

444
00:37:58,064 --> 00:37:59,200
Grain 'em.

445
00:37:59,597 --> 00:38:01,266
Rio, Gonzales!

446
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,431
Who is he?

447
00:38:08,551 --> 00:38:09,458
Friend of mine.

448
00:38:20,153 --> 00:38:23,909
Good to see you, Frenchy. Heard
you were on your way an hour ago.

449
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:26,807
Don't be surprised
at anything around here.

450
00:38:27,392 --> 00:38:28,686
The boss is waiting to see you.

451
00:38:34,793 --> 00:38:35,857
Hello, Boss.

452
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:41,029
Frenchy, you old mustang.

453
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:44,970
Welcome back to Chuck-A-Luck.

454
00:38:52,269 --> 00:38:54,105
Meet the boss of this ranch,
Altar Keane.

455
00:38:56,564 --> 00:38:58,552
Lookout said somebody was with you.

456
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:01,138
But for him, I might be on a rope
this very minute.

457
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:02,819
Little trouble up in Gunsight.

458
00:39:02,939 --> 00:39:04,587
Used his head and used his guts.

459
00:39:07,909 --> 00:39:09,370
Uses his eyes too, doesn't he?

460
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:15,553
What are you staring at?
Shall I turn around?

461
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:21,462
I've heard so many stories about you
I wasn't sure there was any Altar Keane.

462
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,969
What do you think I was? a pipe dream?

463
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:25,425
I guess so.

464
00:39:25,545 --> 00:39:28,034
It's the first time I ever met with a
real live pipe dream

465
00:39:28,354 --> 00:39:31,510
with grease on her arms.
It sure is unsettling.

466
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,840
Well, settle down.

467
00:39:33,341 --> 00:39:34,910
Does he need to be out of sight?

468
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:38,097
He helped me break jail. There's a warrant
for any man who'd do that.

469
00:39:39,391 --> 00:39:42,379
I'm tired. It was a long ride.
How many staying here now?

470
00:39:42,499 --> 00:39:43,944
Nine including the lookouts.

471
00:39:44,064 --> 00:39:47,317
Star came in last week.
He's wanted in three states.

472
00:39:50,006 --> 00:39:52,176
Any friend of Frenchy's is welcome,
if he agrees to the rules.

473
00:39:52,594 --> 00:39:54,054
if he agrees with the rules.

474
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,164
Hard to fancy anybody
not agreeing with your rules!

475
00:39:58,594 --> 00:40:00,648
We don't fight here,
we don't ask any questions.

476
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,753
Everybody does his share of work.
And you'll do yours.

477
00:40:03,873 --> 00:40:06,482
Sure, I'm good at cattle work.

478
00:40:06,602 --> 00:40:07,992
This is a horse ranch.

479
00:40:15,643 --> 00:40:18,815
That's good music, isn't it?
- I'll take him in.

480
00:40:19,618 --> 00:40:21,276
How do you want to be known here ?

481
00:40:21,396 --> 00:40:22,691
My name's Vern Haskell.

482
00:40:22,811 --> 00:40:24,903
Some don't care
to be called by their names.

483
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:25,938
Vern'll do.

484
00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:27,788
All right.

485
00:40:33,422 --> 00:40:36,162
We've got a new man tonight.
He helped Frenchy out of a jam.

486
00:40:36,282 --> 00:40:37,567
He'll stay here for a while.

487
00:40:37,891 --> 00:40:38,934
Goes by the name of Vern.

488
00:40:39,811 --> 00:40:42,211
This is Star. He carried one once.

489
00:40:42,712 --> 00:40:44,193
- Hi !
- And this is Red.

490
00:40:44,313 --> 00:40:46,862
Doesn't touch
liquor but is death on candy.

491
00:40:47,301 --> 00:40:51,301
Here's Preacher -
he claims he was one once.

492
00:40:51,781 --> 00:40:54,581
"Be joyful for you shall find
haven here. "

493
00:40:54,701 --> 00:40:56,860
Preacher always reads
over anybody he kills.

494
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,885
This is the best hiding place
you can find this side the moon.

495
00:41:01,005 --> 00:41:04,557
Meet Harbin.
His warrants rotted away long ago.

496
00:41:04,952 --> 00:41:06,689
I don't mind. There'll be more.

497
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:08,484
This is Comanche Paul.

498
00:41:08,604 --> 00:41:11,202
He's half-Indian - the honest half.

499
00:41:12,383 --> 00:41:13,437
<i>Meet Wilson. </i>

500
00:41:13,761 --> 00:41:14,846
<i>Look at that smile.</i>

501
00:41:15,576 --> 00:41:17,496
<i>He spends most his time chasing ladies.</i>

502
00:41:17,872 --> 00:41:19,695
<i>No girl is safe when he's around.</i>

503
00:41:21,554 --> 00:41:23,224
Looks like one of them
had some fight in her!

504
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:28,240
Uh-uh. Bobcat made these. A real bobcat.

505
00:41:28,908 --> 00:41:30,079
Male or female?

506
00:41:30,872 --> 00:41:32,959
Don't forget what I said
- no questions.

507
00:41:34,065 --> 00:41:36,371
This is Kinch. He has a way with gold.

508
00:41:36,491 --> 00:41:38,525
He used to pan it.
Now he just borrows it.

509
00:41:38,645 --> 00:41:39,858
Sit down over there.

510
00:41:40,423 --> 00:41:42,384
- Where is Frenchy?
- He's eating with me.

511
00:41:47,987 --> 00:41:49,177
Mighty handsome filly.

512
00:41:57,829 --> 00:42:00,209
You'll like Vern. He's all right.

513
00:42:00,626 --> 00:42:02,207
Outside of being a little fresh.

514
00:42:04,669 --> 00:42:06,172
Could you find any use for this?

515
00:42:07,028 --> 00:42:11,059
Thank you. I haven't had perfume
since I went to El Paso two years ago.

516
00:42:11,455 --> 00:42:15,191
I'm sorry I haven't got
anything else for your birthday.

517
00:42:15,734 --> 00:42:17,038
They caught you, huh?

518
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:23,731
Crazy Frenchy.

519
00:42:27,275 --> 00:42:30,322
Risking your life
for a bottle of perfume.

520
00:42:31,887 --> 00:42:34,374
Don't ask me how old
I'll be tomorrow, or I'll ask you.

521
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:36,669
Does another year bother you?

522
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:39,980
Every year's a threat to a woman.

523
00:42:40,334 --> 00:42:41,587
Crazy Altar.

524
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,762
I been riding alone too long
this time. It's good to be back.

525
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:04,686
Pretty good, huh?

526
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,335
Pretty good.

527
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:09,778
I might have liked that kind
of riding 10 or 12 years ago.

528
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:44,860
He can handle a horse all right!

529
00:43:45,403 --> 00:43:46,923
Ever seen him before?
- No.

530
00:43:47,043 --> 00:43:49,172
- Certain?
- I never lose a face.

531
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:52,720
He was looking at you
all through supper.

532
00:43:53,275 --> 00:43:55,195
He sure does gander, doesn't he?

533
00:43:55,571 --> 00:43:57,011
He looks straight through a man.

534
00:43:57,929 --> 00:43:59,349
Fancy riding!

535
00:43:59,469 --> 00:44:02,479
Yeah. She's a cocky filly.
Like a lot of women.

536
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:05,255
Takes a lot of breaking
before she comes nice and even.

537
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:07,086
You're dead right on that.

538
00:44:12,923 --> 00:44:14,885
Hi, Gaary. Hi, Wilson!

539
00:44:16,035 --> 00:44:18,769
Howdy. Coming to this party?
- And away from a marshal.

540
00:44:21,253 --> 00:44:23,781
Amigo, you sit on a horse
more better than anybody.

541
00:44:24,156 --> 00:44:25,393
If you let me say so, señor.

542
00:44:25,513 --> 00:44:27,709
They don't come any tougher
than this one, even in Wyoming.

543
00:44:28,562 --> 00:44:30,258
Any horses from up there?

544
00:44:30,378 --> 00:44:33,612
Don't know.
We are only paid hands here.

545
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:43,212
Some of these fellas
range pretty far from here, don't they?

546
00:44:43,332 --> 00:44:46,547
Used to be five paid hands.
There wasMartinez.

547
00:44:47,027 --> 00:44:50,533
Worked on saddles and bridles.
He began to talk a lot in town.

548
00:44:50,909 --> 00:44:54,403
He began to answer a lot of questions.
No bridle on his tongue.

549
00:44:54,899 --> 00:44:56,156
Only four of us here now.

550
00:44:57,953 --> 00:44:59,853
We never know what become
of Martinez.

551
00:45:00,374 --> 00:45:04,386
They say...
Maybe you know what they say.

552
00:45:04,506 --> 00:45:05,424
You see?

553
00:45:06,765 --> 00:45:09,520
Yeah. Yeah, I see.

554
00:45:09,937 --> 00:45:12,337
A carful of cattlemen
was on a siding.

555
00:45:12,817 --> 00:45:15,893
Jess went on one end, me on the other,
and we met in the middle.

556
00:45:16,344 --> 00:45:19,096
The boys were very obliging,
just emptied out their pockets.

557
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,829
One tried to be brave.
We had to take care of him.

558
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:25,902
We've been one jump ahead
of marshalshalf-way across Texas.

559
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,053
What's the account?
- $4,800.

560
00:45:29,366 --> 00:45:30,370
That yours?

561
00:45:30,891 --> 00:45:33,756
480 for Chuck-A-Luck.
- That's right.

562
00:45:33,876 --> 00:45:36,733
Care for any of that?
- No.

563
00:45:38,048 --> 00:45:40,779
Ten per cent of this would be,
I should say, $50 ?

564
00:45:41,635 --> 00:45:42,720
$50?

565
00:45:45,016 --> 00:45:45,955
$50

566
00:45:50,853 --> 00:45:53,342
We'd better keep our faces
here for a month or so.

567
00:45:53,462 --> 00:45:55,301
Before you do, let's see
what's in that bag?

568
00:45:56,658 --> 00:45:59,350
Bonds. City of Austin bonds.

569
00:45:59,851 --> 00:46:00,832
They're worthless.

570
00:46:06,787 --> 00:46:08,519
$1,100 worthless?

571
00:46:09,986 --> 00:46:14,828
I take $110 in cash. Now.

572
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:17,497
Wait a minute. How d'you expect us
to cash those in?

573
00:46:18,164 --> 00:46:20,919
That's your trouble.
I don't ask you to stay here.

574
00:46:23,127 --> 00:46:26,944
That's your price?
- Always. Ten per cent of everything.

575
00:46:27,257 --> 00:46:29,871
You been riding mighty high, Altar.
Some day...

576
00:46:29,991 --> 00:46:31,055
Some day what?

577
00:46:36,962 --> 00:46:37,902
Count it out, Jess.

578
00:46:40,218 --> 00:46:42,179
You'll have a chance
to win it back tonight.

579
00:46:45,877 --> 00:46:48,580
You're mighty lucky.
- Do you mind? On my birthday?

580
00:46:59,672 --> 00:47:02,343
I been chasing this filly.
She finally asks me in.

581
00:47:03,533 --> 00:47:06,583
I said, "You got a husband or two.
Where are they tonight?"

582
00:47:07,093 --> 00:47:09,115
She said, "I got three husbands,

583
00:47:09,553 --> 00:47:12,290
they're all down in the cellar.
I lock 'em up when I'm not using 'em."

584
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:14,121
Are you coming in or not?"

585
00:47:18,837 --> 00:47:21,258
You'd do anything to get
a girl, wouldn't you?

586
00:47:21,831 --> 00:47:22,859
Wouldn't you?

587
00:47:29,598 --> 00:47:30,475
I'm in.

588
00:47:35,292 --> 00:47:36,961
Isn't this worth staying for?

589
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,967
I'm out.
- Somebody get me a drink.

590
00:47:50,266 --> 00:47:51,691
You still don't remember him?

591
00:47:51,811 --> 00:47:54,871
I never lose a face. I've never seen him.

592
00:47:54,991 --> 00:47:58,556
Looks like a lot of men.
- What's bothering you, Kinch?

593
00:47:59,182 --> 00:48:02,908
I don't know. The way he looked at you
when you told that story...

594
00:48:03,028 --> 00:48:05,793
Frenchy brought him here.
That's enough for me.

595
00:48:07,942 --> 00:48:09,758
You're always right there
when you're needed, aren't you?

596
00:48:21,037 --> 00:48:22,060
Ace is bet.

597
00:48:22,769 --> 00:48:23,917
Gonna play my luck.

598
00:48:25,923 --> 00:48:26,860
And a hundred.

599
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:29,659
Too steep for me.

600
00:48:34,746 --> 00:48:35,894
I'll see you.

601
00:48:37,796 --> 00:48:38,579
Three fives.

602
00:48:38,871 --> 00:48:41,250
Hold it! I don't wanna see
Altar swindled on her birthday!

603
00:48:42,158 --> 00:48:45,247
Geary bugged that card. I seen it.
- What?

604
00:48:46,207 --> 00:48:47,459
Say that again, Harbin.

605
00:48:48,054 --> 00:48:49,358
He cheated, I tell you.

606
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,522
I knew he cheated.

607
00:48:59,795 --> 00:49:01,423
That's why I stole his watch.

608
00:49:04,921 --> 00:49:06,287
I'd trade it for the pot.

609
00:49:07,321 --> 00:49:08,907
I'd call that a fair trade.

610
00:49:14,517 --> 00:49:16,545
How about that song, Altar?

611
00:49:16,665 --> 00:49:17,776
That's right. Give us a tune.

612
00:49:17,896 --> 00:49:20,893
It's written there are
three things a man really requires

613
00:49:21,206 --> 00:49:23,711
good whiskey, a bold song
and an honest woman.

614
00:49:23,831 --> 00:49:25,236
Or any woman.

615
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:27,840
Take care of my money, Harbin.

616
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:32,266
I've had all kinds but never found one
to equal Altar. How do you feel about that?

617
00:49:32,997 --> 00:49:35,491
- I wouldn't know about it.
- Maybe he's got a sweetheart.

618
00:49:38,238 --> 00:49:40,449
Let's have some music.
Let's have fun.

619
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,457
<i>A young man is reckless and ready</i>

620
00:49:55,157 --> 00:49:58,512
<i>A young man is handsome and vain</i>

621
00:49:58,921 --> 00:50:03,203
<i>He's young and intense,
but hasn't the sense</i>

622
00:50:04,011 --> 00:50:06,844
<i>To come in out of the rain</i>

623
00:50:07,718 --> 00:50:11,466
<i>Get away, get away</i>

624
00:50:12,156 --> 00:50:15,070
<i>Get away, young man, get away!</i>

625
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:28,389
<i>A young man is full of adventure</i>

626
00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:31,206
<i>And eager to do what he can</i>

627
00:50:32,423 --> 00:50:37,568
<i>He may be a joy,
but don't send a boy</i>

628
00:50:37,652 --> 00:50:40,721
<i>To do the work of a man</i>

629
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:44,999
<i>Get away, get away</i>

630
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:49,006
<i>Get away, young man, get away!</i>

631
00:50:53,531 --> 00:50:56,918
<i>A young man will come
when you call him</i>

632
00:50:57,728 --> 00:51:01,131
<i>And leave when you tell him to go</i>

633
00:51:01,344 --> 00:51:06,659
<i>But some day he'll guess
a woman means yes</i>

634
00:51:07,059 --> 00:51:11,447
<i>Whenever a woman says no</i>

635
00:51:11,447 --> 00:51:15,071
<i>Get away, get away</i>

636
00:51:15,986 --> 00:51:19,624
<i>Get away, young man, get away!</i>

637
00:51:19,924 --> 00:51:23,215
<i>A woman is only a creature</i>

638
00:51:23,733 --> 00:51:26,583
<i>of notions and dimples and lies</i>

639
00:51:26,971 --> 00:51:29,176
<i>So learn, if you can,</i>

640
00:51:29,176 --> 00:51:31,647
<i>this lesson, young man</i>

641
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:36,664
<i>And don't run off when she cries</i>

642
00:51:36,764 --> 00:51:43,652
<i>"Get away, get away, get away,
young man, get away!"</i>

643
00:51:44,072 --> 00:51:47,793
<i>Get away, get away,
get away, young man</i>

644
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:55,562
<i>Get away, get away, if you can!</i>

645
00:52:03,017 --> 00:52:04,207
Altar, lookout coming!

646
00:52:05,867 --> 00:52:07,745
Saw some riders at Dry Creek!

647
00:52:08,121 --> 00:52:10,646
Looks like a posse headed for the ranch!

648
00:52:10,982 --> 00:52:14,257
Regular hands, stay here.
Everybody else, clear your gear.

649
00:52:14,377 --> 00:52:15,750
- Go to the Ridge Camp.
- Let's go !!

650
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:18,607
Lookout, go back to your post. Get
the horses settled.

651
00:52:18,727 --> 00:52:20,944
Clean up this mess.
Get rid of the bottles!

652
00:52:21,064 --> 00:52:23,357
Would you like me to stay?
- No, I can handle this.

653
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:25,757
They don't know my face...
- Go with the others!

654
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,660
Get going!
- You heard the lady.

655
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:31,765
Ride to the ridge camp.
Stay until I send word.

656
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:33,634
In a day or a month.

657
00:52:49,731 --> 00:52:50,879
<i>Everybody ready? Come on!</i>

658
00:53:28,248 --> 00:53:29,730
<i>Hello, Spinning C!
</i>

659
00:53:30,502 --> 00:53:31,400
<i>Hello, the ranch!</i>

660
00:53:33,332 --> 00:53:34,522
<i>Anyone awake?</i>

661
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:49,229
Marshal Donaldson!
We haven't seen you in months.

662
00:53:49,584 --> 00:53:51,663
Hello, Miss Keane. You're up late.

663
00:53:52,185 --> 00:53:53,604
I was working on my books.

664
00:53:53,896 --> 00:53:55,462
We're hunting four men, Miss Keane.

665
00:53:56,255 --> 00:53:58,592
We have word that Frenchy Fairmont

666
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:01,997
and a man that
helped him break jail, Vern Haskell,

667
00:54:02,331 --> 00:54:04,063
passed down this way
a couple of days ago.

668
00:54:04,626 --> 00:54:05,899
A sheep herder saw them.

669
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:09,958
Then two men,
Mort Geary and Jess Factor,

670
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:12,076
wanted in Texas for a train robbery,

671
00:54:12,488 --> 00:54:14,115
were reported heading this way.

672
00:54:14,929 --> 00:54:16,413
That's mighty peculiar, isn't it?

673
00:54:16,893 --> 00:54:17,712
Yes.

674
00:54:19,613 --> 00:54:21,724
Unless they're all
headed for the border.

675
00:54:22,347 --> 00:54:24,371
No sign of them here?
- Not at all.

676
00:54:25,019 --> 00:54:26,803
Things are
very peaceful these days.

677
00:54:30,585 --> 00:54:34,341
I don't like to do it, but I've got
to ask you one thing more.

678
00:54:34,461 --> 00:54:37,691
Yes...
- We're far from the border.

679
00:54:38,004 --> 00:54:41,061
We'd like to breathe our horses
here and loan some of yours.

680
00:54:41,492 --> 00:54:43,027
Always glad to oblige.

681
00:54:43,653 --> 00:54:45,714
Rio, Gonzales,
get five of our best horses.

682
00:54:45,834 --> 00:54:48,904
We'll help.
- Would you like a drink?

683
00:54:49,024 --> 00:54:51,142
I should keep
my trigger finger steady

684
00:54:51,262 --> 00:54:52,160
but it's a long night.

685
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,923
It will take a while to get the horses.

686
00:55:13,413 --> 00:55:15,610
Vern. Where's Vern?

687
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:18,344
He stopped a way back.
His saddle was slipping.

688
00:55:18,464 --> 00:55:20,574
He'll never find this trail alone.
I'll go back for him.

689
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:23,813
The horses are ready, marshall.

690
00:55:23,933 --> 00:55:26,439
Would you like a drink?

691
00:55:27,232 --> 00:55:29,241
Thank you.
- I hope we can repay you.

692
00:55:29,361 --> 00:55:33,652
You can. If you hear of any Eastern
buyers of stock, let me know.

693
00:55:33,772 --> 00:55:37,297
I have a cousin up north
who might give you some trade.

694
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,491
That's nice.

695
00:55:39,611 --> 00:55:41,364
How many horses do you have?
- About 42.

696
00:55:42,094 --> 00:55:44,817
Strange.
I counted 33 in the corral.

697
00:55:47,823 --> 00:55:49,466
How did you happen to count them?

698
00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:52,373
Because I noticed fresh tracks.

699
00:55:52,999 --> 00:55:55,099
Shoes fresh in the clay,
leading out of the corral

700
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:57,483
tracks for eight or ten horses.

701
00:55:57,603 --> 00:55:59,572
<i>I saw those strays, ma'am,</i>

702
00:56:01,764 --> 00:56:04,190
they're grazing
in the box canyon across the valley.

703
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:06,094
We can round them up
now or in the morning.

704
00:56:06,214 --> 00:56:07,721
Are they safe there?

705
00:56:08,147 --> 00:56:10,294
I'd say so.
- Morning will do, then. -

706
00:56:10,314 --> 00:56:12,085
Sorry I left the gate rope off, ma'am.

707
00:56:12,205 --> 00:56:14,987
- Who are you?
- My new hand, Marshal.

708
00:56:15,612 --> 00:56:17,998
I thought you used only Mexicans
on your ranch, Miss Keane.

709
00:56:18,118 --> 00:56:20,873
I needed an extra man. He's good at
breaking broncs.

710
00:56:20,993 --> 00:56:22,561
though careless, sometimes.

711
00:56:27,173 --> 00:56:30,742
- You wear your holster mighty high.
- Don't have to reach as far that way.

712
00:56:31,936 --> 00:56:32,958
Let me see your hands.

713
00:56:33,078 --> 00:56:34,565
They're not as soft as yours.

714
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:37,143
I don't earn my living
as a gunsling.

715
00:56:39,421 --> 00:56:41,905
Takes years of cowpunching
to make 'em that rough.

716
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:43,846
Sorry, son.

717
00:56:45,703 --> 00:56:49,167
I got a good man here too.
But sometimes he's too careful!

718
00:56:50,211 --> 00:56:52,183
Thanks. Goodnight.
- I'll go with you.

719
00:56:52,747 --> 00:56:53,978
Wait for me.
- Yes, ma'am.

720
00:56:58,603 --> 00:56:59,855
Come on!

721
00:57:07,926 --> 00:57:09,658
Goodbye, Miss Keane.
Come on, men.

722
00:57:23,253 --> 00:57:24,755
You're always standing in doorways.

723
00:57:27,388 --> 00:57:29,037
And always using your eyes.

724
00:57:30,185 --> 00:57:32,368
That way you see things
you never expected to see.

725
00:57:32,488 --> 00:57:35,191
Like stray horses?
That was clever of you.

726
00:57:35,311 --> 00:57:36,151
Thanks.

727
00:57:36,271 --> 00:57:39,210
I'm very grateful but
the men here must do as I say.

728
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:42,778
Why aren't you with the others?
- I lost them on the way.

729
00:57:43,279 --> 00:57:46,087
Figured I might find what I was
looking for back here.

730
00:57:46,207 --> 00:57:47,636
Expect me to believe that?

731
00:57:50,121 --> 00:57:54,358
That dress you had on tonight...
I never saw a stylier one.

732
00:57:55,443 --> 00:57:57,384
They made you out of salt and brass!

733
00:57:58,051 --> 00:58:01,132
Where did that bracelet come from,
and that brooch?

734
00:58:01,486 --> 00:58:02,780
Who gave them to you?

735
00:58:03,511 --> 00:58:05,713
I guess things have
to be explained double to you!

736
00:58:06,589 --> 00:58:07,841
There are no questions here. None!

737
00:58:08,971 --> 00:58:11,606
Don't ask people where
they come from

738
00:58:11,726 --> 00:58:13,354
or where they're going
or if the moon is yellow.

739
00:58:13,688 --> 00:58:17,037
You don't ask me where I get
my jewellery!It's none of your business.

740
00:58:18,269 --> 00:58:19,985
The rules are meant to be kept.

741
00:58:20,849 --> 00:58:23,624
If you don't intend to keep them,
you can clear out right now.

742
00:58:27,067 --> 00:58:29,377
It's hard for a man to look at you
and keep any rules.

743
00:58:32,466 --> 00:58:33,772
Did you just think of that?

744
00:58:34,065 --> 00:58:37,735
No, I thought of that first minute
I saw you, grease and all.

745
00:58:38,274 --> 00:58:39,787
Like heat lightning, I suppose.

746
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,378
<i>How d'you know?</i>

747
00:58:41,498 --> 00:58:44,274
Every time you see me,
you feel weak in the head.

748
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:49,024
No, I feel sorry for myself.
Sorry I never met you before.

749
00:58:50,192 --> 00:58:52,806
Sorry I never had a chance
to give you a brooch like this.

750
00:58:55,185 --> 00:58:57,826
You're as smooth on the ground
as you are on a horse.

751
00:58:58,974 --> 00:59:01,107
Only when somebody irons me out...

752
00:59:01,866 --> 00:59:03,118
like you do.

753
00:59:06,003 --> 00:59:09,238
Vern, when you come to a fenced range,
do you always try to climb over?

754
00:59:10,219 --> 00:59:12,170
I always see if the gate's open first.

755
00:59:12,859 --> 00:59:15,321
One way or another, though, you try.

756
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:23,582
That was for trying.

757
00:59:25,464 --> 00:59:26,742
That was for trying too hard.

758
00:59:26,862 --> 00:59:29,515
You're real unfair, ma'am.
- Why?

759
00:59:30,475 --> 00:59:32,291
Got two slaps, only one kiss.

760
01:00:09,512 --> 01:00:13,850
You go and saddle my horse.
I'll lead you up to the trail...

761
01:00:13,975 --> 01:00:15,059
Frenchy?

762
01:00:19,904 --> 01:00:22,022
Beautiful night for chasing up
and down in the mountain.

763
01:00:22,142 --> 01:00:26,291
Sorry I lost you. The only place
I knew where to go was here.

764
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:29,485
Not being a sceptical man,
that's what I figured.

765
01:00:29,605 --> 01:00:30,756
Is everything all right?

766
01:00:30,876 --> 01:00:33,968
The posse was looking for
you, Vern, Geary and Factor.

767
01:00:34,403 --> 01:00:36,010
They'll be back in the morning.

768
01:00:36,597 --> 01:00:39,644
We'd better leave. I'll bring
everybody back tomorrow night.

769
01:00:40,333 --> 01:00:41,361
Go to bed.

770
01:00:42,404 --> 01:00:44,074
Nobody'll get lost this time.

771
01:01:13,171 --> 01:01:15,159
That's what I call threading a needle!

772
01:01:15,279 --> 01:01:19,368
I once saw Bat Masterson shoot the
toe off a fella with his boot on.

773
01:01:19,488 --> 01:01:22,230
I'll be glad to duplicate that.

774
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:23,510
Stick out your foot.

775
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:25,466
What's the matter, Frenchy?
That wasn't personal.

776
01:01:25,586 --> 01:01:28,111
Harbin, hang up another rein.

777
01:01:29,505 --> 01:01:31,868
Lately, I see you
trying everything I do.

778
01:01:33,788 --> 01:01:35,973
He's good at that kind of a stunt.

779
01:01:37,356 --> 01:01:39,608
I don't know how he'd be
drawing against a man.

780
01:01:44,154 --> 01:01:45,469
That would depend on the man.

781
01:01:46,524 --> 01:01:47,735
I call that fair shooting.

782
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:51,261
If I keep on, I might even
be able to outdraw you some day.

783
01:01:52,758 --> 01:01:54,045
Don't ever try it.

784
01:02:06,165 --> 01:02:07,891
You only stayed six weeks this time.

785
01:02:08,434 --> 01:02:11,209
I came back empty-handed the last.
I need some income.

786
01:02:11,329 --> 01:02:12,497
Going tonight?

787
01:02:12,936 --> 01:02:15,253
I'm riding to Clay Springs
in the morning with Star.

788
01:02:16,422 --> 01:02:20,000
There's a bank I wanna look over
before doing some other jobs.

789
01:02:20,827 --> 01:02:23,404
I'm hoping six men can handle it.
But it might takemore.

790
01:02:24,025 --> 01:02:25,975
I'll be back in 2 or 3 days.

791
01:02:26,095 --> 01:02:28,933
- That's what the shooting was about?
- Target practice.

792
01:02:29,549 --> 01:02:31,333
Vern's getting pretty handy with a. 45.

793
01:02:32,998 --> 01:02:34,312
You're not taking him?

794
01:02:36,441 --> 01:02:38,017
And why not?
- He's...

795
01:02:41,295 --> 01:02:44,113
He's not...
- You mean he's not an outlaw?

796
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:48,401
That never bothered you about me.

797
01:02:49,903 --> 01:02:53,076
When I met you,
you were chin-deep in this kind of life.

798
01:02:53,196 --> 01:02:55,213
You couldn't go back. Even if you
wanted to, they wouldn't let you.

799
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:58,380
- But he can.
- Maybe so. It's not how he acts.

800
01:02:58,724 --> 01:03:00,725
His draw is as fast as you'll find them.

801
01:03:00,845 --> 01:03:03,493
No matter how fast he is,
there's always gonna be someone faster.

802
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,559
That's right. Me.

803
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:08,012
Some day you won't come back.

804
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:09,849
Or you'll come back full of lead.

805
01:03:11,784 --> 01:03:13,349
You're not talking about me.

806
01:03:14,402 --> 01:03:15,451
You're talking about him.

807
01:03:15,571 --> 01:03:16,510
No, Frenchy.

808
01:03:18,012 --> 01:03:19,295
I think you're lying.

809
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:24,080
Maybe I am.

810
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:28,198
Look, Altar, once in a lifetime,
a woman means something to a man.

811
01:03:28,636 --> 01:03:31,266
I know, Frenchy.
- Time holds us together.

812
01:03:32,393 --> 01:03:34,417
Time is stronger than a rope.

813
01:03:42,778 --> 01:03:46,013
We buy your horses,
work your ranch. Now this.

814
01:03:46,133 --> 01:03:47,160
That's right.

815
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,978
Send back my ten per cent of
that bank robbery

816
01:03:50,098 --> 01:03:51,376
before you go on to your other jobs.

817
01:03:51,496 --> 01:03:54,002
Why the change in rules?
The whole trip will take a month.

818
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:57,200
If you land in jail, I get nothing.
- You took that risk before.

819
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:00,050
- Not now.
- Maybe you don't trust us.

820
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:01,746
- Lately...
- Lately what?

821
01:04:02,173 --> 01:04:05,074
We ought to worry about trusting you.

822
01:04:05,423 --> 01:04:07,573
Then find another Chuck-A-Luck.

823
01:04:08,783 --> 01:04:12,001
That's like finding a potato tree, brethren.

824
01:04:12,121 --> 01:04:14,370
When's Frenchy back?
- Later today.

825
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:15,533
What's he got to do with it?

826
01:04:15,846 --> 01:04:18,374
We'll talk this over with him.

827
01:04:19,187 --> 01:04:21,233
I'm the boss of this ranch, Kinch.

828
01:04:22,381 --> 01:04:24,039
I make the rules.

829
01:04:29,429 --> 01:04:31,902
I told you to saddle my horse.
What is the other one for?

830
01:04:32,278 --> 01:04:33,446
For me, ma'am.

831
01:04:38,835 --> 01:04:40,317
All right. Come along if you want to.

832
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:52,124
That's who! That's who he is.
I knew I'd seen him before!

833
01:04:52,244 --> 01:04:55,025
The way he climbs up on a horse!
- Got him placed?

834
01:04:55,145 --> 01:04:57,725
- A little town up in Wyoming.
- What'd he do?

835
01:04:58,977 --> 01:05:00,897
It ain't what he did.
Never mind.

836
01:05:01,899 --> 01:05:05,146
Believe me, the sooner he gets a
bullet through his head, the better.

837
01:05:08,892 --> 01:05:11,214
I was working with your horse.

838
01:05:11,315 --> 01:05:13,644
Soon he'll be able to read and write.

839
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:15,246
Yes, I've been watching you.

840
01:05:15,684 --> 01:05:17,709
I don't want him
to learn stupid tricks.

841
01:05:28,945 --> 01:05:30,740
Sorry. I'm moody these days.

842
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:33,933
It's been a dry summer.
The earth's baked hard.

843
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,831
Gets people out of sorts too,
the weather does.

844
01:05:37,995 --> 01:05:39,414
My father told me that.

845
01:05:40,688 --> 01:05:42,587
How long do you intend to stay?

846
01:05:44,719 --> 01:05:46,983
Maybe till the rains come.

847
01:05:47,192 --> 01:05:50,814
If a girl won't blow out the candle,
the rain'll dowse it sometimes.

848
01:05:52,353 --> 01:05:53,840
Did your father tell you that?

849
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:56,215
No, I just sort of made that up myself.

850
01:05:58,511 --> 01:06:00,516
Whenever I should be angry at you, I laugh.

851
01:06:00,933 --> 01:06:03,375
- You think I'm pretty funny?
- I do.

852
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:08,634
I only met one man who didn't want
something behind his pretty talk.

853
01:06:10,763 --> 01:06:13,455
What I want, if I were allowed to ask,

854
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:16,369
is to know a thousand things
about you.

855
01:06:16,953 --> 01:06:19,061
Where you were born,
how you came out west,

856
01:06:19,666 --> 01:06:21,774
where you got that dress,

857
01:06:22,734 --> 01:06:24,105
where you got your jewellery,

858
01:06:25,044 --> 01:06:27,267
what stories about you
are true and what aren't.

859
01:06:28,128 --> 01:06:31,405
The dress is from New Orleans,
and I can tell you what isn't true...

860
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:33,805
I positively never wore green hair!

861
01:06:36,416 --> 01:06:38,619
Did they name a parlour car after you?
- Mm-hm.

862
01:06:39,736 --> 01:06:42,372
Kansas Pacific Railroad...
the Altar Keane.

863
01:06:42,492 --> 01:06:45,813
That diamond you had, famous in
four states, big as a doorknob.

864
01:06:45,933 --> 01:06:47,832
That's right but it wasn't real.

865
01:06:48,858 --> 01:06:51,221
The fella who gave it to me was like
something like you.

866
01:06:51,237 --> 01:06:54,200
Fresh, sort of
honest-looking round the mouth.

867
01:06:55,974 --> 01:06:57,607
Anyway, you've got a girl somewhere.

868
01:06:57,727 --> 01:06:59,605
No, I haven't.
- Then you've got five of them.

869
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:01,351
No.

870
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:04,325
No, I have no girl.

871
01:07:09,587 --> 01:07:11,027
I'd wish you'd go away...

872
01:07:12,321 --> 01:07:14,150
and come back ten years ago.

873
01:07:23,913 --> 01:07:27,044
Go away, Vern. I don't want
you any more. I mean it.

874
01:07:28,006 --> 01:07:29,993
Get off my ranch and leave me alone.

875
01:07:40,946 --> 01:07:44,371
Suppose this is the main street
of Clay Springs.

876
01:07:45,018 --> 01:07:46,406
Right here is the bank.

877
01:07:47,084 --> 01:07:51,148
Next to the bank is a store. Next
to that is the Primrose Theatre.

878
01:07:52,091 --> 01:07:54,351
Down a bit is the saloon.

879
01:07:54,471 --> 01:07:56,516
- Where's the sheriff?
- Asleep, I hope.

880
01:07:58,178 --> 01:07:59,503
But there's our worry.

881
01:08:00,014 --> 01:08:03,254
Here, straight across from the bank
is the marshall's office.

882
01:08:04,358 --> 01:08:07,133
If anything goes wrong,
some of us'll get sawed off.

883
01:08:07,446 --> 01:08:09,637
- How many men will we need?
- Nine.

884
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:12,309
Five in the bank,
three in the street

885
01:08:12,956 --> 01:08:17,930
and somebody, who's not known in
town, on the balcony of the theatre.

886
01:08:18,641 --> 01:08:21,625
From here, he can draw a bead
right on the marshals' office.

887
01:08:24,026 --> 01:08:27,156
I never been in Clay Springs.
- Right

888
01:08:28,419 --> 01:08:31,761
You Frenchy, Star, Jess and me
make four more. That's 5.

889
01:08:31,972 --> 01:08:33,697
- Comanche?
- I go.

890
01:08:34,511 --> 01:08:36,236
I'd like to make it.

891
01:08:36,778 --> 01:08:39,768
Sorry, Harbin. No deal for a man
who can't move fast if he need to.

892
01:08:39,888 --> 01:08:41,119
- But I...
- Red? - No.

893
01:08:41,427 --> 01:08:44,923
I'm heading out tomorrow myself.
I got a little matter down in Mexico.

894
01:08:46,624 --> 01:08:47,584
Preacher?

895
01:08:49,003 --> 01:08:52,223
Praying for Mammon has always
been my infirmity. I'll ride.

896
01:08:52,343 --> 01:08:54,485
I'm number eight. We're one shy.

897
01:08:54,605 --> 01:08:57,908
How about Vern? His gun would be
worth a lot if we ran into real trouble.

898
01:08:58,028 --> 01:09:00,449
No, he doesn't belong in this.
- Leave him here?

899
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:02,661
That won't make Altar unhappy.

900
01:09:06,789 --> 01:09:10,045
I get your point,
but I'll make up my own mind.

901
01:09:10,474 --> 01:09:13,417
I forgive you for being so foolish,
but not for being so wrong.

902
01:09:15,212 --> 01:09:17,890
Am I wrong, Altar?
- Frenchy,

903
01:09:18,912 --> 01:09:21,591
he's young and handsome.
It's easy to take a fancy to him.

904
01:09:22,592 --> 01:09:24,951
He makes you remember
yourself a long time back,

905
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:28,242
but there's been nothing.

906
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:31,769
I told him to leave
the ranch this afternoon.

907
01:09:32,187 --> 01:09:34,152
He's riding with us tomorrow.

908
01:09:34,272 --> 01:09:37,486
- Did he ask to go along?
- No. I'm telling him.

909
01:09:38,362 --> 01:09:40,762
We need him and he'll come
whether he likes it or not.

910
01:09:42,176 --> 01:09:43,219
Do you mind?

911
01:09:45,557 --> 01:09:46,454
No,

912
01:09:47,957 --> 01:09:49,188
I don't mind.

913
01:10:58,756 --> 01:10:59,737
They hit me in the shoulder.

914
01:11:00,196 --> 01:11:01,156
Star's hit.

915
01:11:21,372 --> 01:11:23,104
I never saw anything messed up finer.

916
01:11:23,438 --> 01:11:25,880
The shot came from across the street.
From the balcony.

917
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,555
It missed me by one or two inches.

918
01:11:27,675 --> 01:11:30,492
Don't blame Jess and me,
we done just what Frenchy said.

919
01:11:30,612 --> 01:11:32,600
Where is he, anyway?
He knows we're meeting here.

920
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:36,122
Don't worry about him,
Frenchy'll get here.

921
01:11:36,474 --> 01:11:39,857
If the next job goes like this...
- We got what we went for!

922
01:11:40,545 --> 01:11:43,117
Let's see who's gonna
take Altar's cut back?

923
01:11:43,237 --> 01:11:46,286
She shouldn't get a cut. I'm fed up
with her ordering me around.

924
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,751
You want trouble with Frenchy?
We've always been safe at Chuck-A-Luck...

925
01:11:49,871 --> 01:11:50,917
You are here two hours.

926
01:11:51,037 --> 01:11:54,824
You don't talk to me. You don't bring
anything. You come dance with me?

927
01:11:56,899 --> 01:11:58,109
In a minute.

928
01:12:00,358 --> 01:12:04,647
Somebody's gotta take Altar's 10%
and get back in 5 or 6 hours.

929
01:12:04,767 --> 01:12:06,001
Yeah! Somebody.

930
01:12:06,313 --> 01:12:07,597
Not me!
- Me neither.

931
01:12:07,717 --> 01:12:10,138
I'm not riding
half the night to cater to Altar.

932
01:12:10,702 --> 01:12:12,392
Well, I'm occupied here.

933
01:12:13,206 --> 01:12:16,077
I've got some dancing to do.
That leaves you three.

934
01:12:17,454 --> 01:12:19,854
Low card fair?
- That's all right with me.

935
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:27,012
King.

936
01:12:33,037 --> 01:12:34,174
Seven of diamonds.

937
01:12:37,827 --> 01:12:38,954
Five of diamonds.

938
01:12:55,577 --> 01:12:57,223
I expected you a little sooner.

939
01:12:59,415 --> 01:13:01,961
I knew you were coming.
The lookout spotted you.

940
01:13:02,858 --> 01:13:04,538
I told you not to come back.

941
01:13:04,909 --> 01:13:08,403
No matter how often you tell me,
I'll come back.

942
01:13:09,008 --> 01:13:10,198
I expected you to.

943
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:14,309
How did it go this morning?
- No difficulties.

944
01:13:15,183 --> 01:13:18,355
A few of us got to Margy's saloon
first. The rest'll be along later.

945
01:13:18,664 --> 01:13:21,627
- Tomorrow we're all gonna go to Langsey.
- Then why are you here?

946
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:24,027
Somebody had to bring you your cut.
- Why you?

947
01:13:24,964 --> 01:13:26,696
I happened to draw low card.

948
01:13:27,643 --> 01:13:29,834
- Happened to?
- I'm lucky at cards.

949
01:13:33,973 --> 01:13:35,767
And I aim to get slapped again.

950
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,290
If I can...
- I knew you would.

951
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:43,685
Sometimes I like a man who doesn't
believe what a woman tells him.

952
01:13:43,805 --> 01:13:46,664
I like a woman
that's sometimes cold like ice,

953
01:13:46,784 --> 01:13:48,897
sometimes burning like the sun.

954
01:13:49,435 --> 01:13:52,936
A pipe dream in blue jeans
or in a birthday dress.

955
01:13:56,311 --> 01:13:59,139
Give me one wish, and I'd wish
to see that rig again, a shawl...

956
01:14:00,031 --> 01:14:01,200
and jewels... and all.

957
01:14:02,828 --> 01:14:03,878
Just like that night.

958
01:14:08,425 --> 01:14:09,666
What are you gonna do about it?

959
01:14:26,754 --> 01:14:28,027
What is it, Vern?

960
01:14:30,714 --> 01:14:34,001
It's a pipe dream. You'll kiss me
tonight and send me away tomorrow.

961
01:14:35,222 --> 01:14:36,224
Maybe.

962
01:14:37,424 --> 01:14:40,032
If that's the way you feel,
where's the money you were bringing?

963
01:14:40,532 --> 01:14:42,932
In my saddlebags.
- Then go and get it.

964
01:14:48,464 --> 01:14:49,319
Star...

965
01:15:20,955 --> 01:15:22,812
I won't send you away tomorrow.

966
01:15:30,819 --> 01:15:32,081
You're very beautiful.

967
01:15:36,654 --> 01:15:38,637
The jewellery Frenchy gave you...

968
01:15:40,452 --> 01:15:42,522
Men are funny. All men are jealous.

969
01:15:43,252 --> 01:15:45,339
Frenchy only gave me one of these.
- Which?

970
01:15:45,986 --> 01:15:49,659
The necklace. The others I bought
myself with the dress.

971
01:15:51,414 --> 01:15:52,371
What about that?

972
01:15:54,012 --> 01:15:54,931
Oh, that?

973
01:15:55,422 --> 01:15:57,467
It was part of my cut.
Kinch gave it to me.

974
01:15:59,593 --> 01:16:00,678
Kinch?

975
01:16:02,264 --> 01:16:03,869
It was Kinch!

976
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:06,519
Vern? What's the matter?

977
01:16:07,187 --> 01:16:11,061
Now I can tell you what's been
choking me every minute.

978
01:16:11,374 --> 01:16:14,287
Who wore that brooch before you?

979
01:16:14,407 --> 01:16:15,831
A girl that I was gonna marry!

980
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:18,887
A girl who was lying on the floor,
outraged and butchered

981
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:20,430
by the man who took that from her

982
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:24,240
and gave it to you
for ten per cent of her life!

983
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:26,308
She's there on the floor,
in front of you.

984
01:16:26,428 --> 01:16:29,076
She's got blue eyes.
Do you feel them staring at you,

985
01:16:29,196 --> 01:16:31,763
see the blood on the floor,
hear her screaming?

986
01:16:31,883 --> 01:16:34,419
- Vern, Kinch didn't tell me...
- Kinch!

987
01:16:34,539 --> 01:16:38,058
I thought it was Wilson, Factor,
Frenchy,

988
01:16:38,178 --> 01:16:39,761
or somebody who'd gone.

989
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:43,560
I'm glad it wasn't Frenchy,
but it could've been.

990
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:46,977
It could've been anybody who came to
Chuck-A-Luck to hide behind your skirts.

991
01:16:47,415 --> 01:16:52,411
Chuck-a-luck! Altar Keane's place!
Look around you, Altar Keane.

992
01:16:52,531 --> 01:16:55,865
What do you see in there,
a bedroom or a morgue?

993
01:16:56,658 --> 01:16:59,475
Look through that window.
Is that a courtyard or a graveyard?

994
01:17:01,529 --> 01:17:03,846
You think a dance-hall girl
was a dirty life?

995
01:17:04,138 --> 01:17:06,872
You ought to be proud of that
compared to what you are now!

996
01:17:07,227 --> 01:17:10,493
Here's your cut
from yesterday's job.

997
01:17:12,449 --> 01:17:14,609
And there's payment for this.

998
01:17:15,058 --> 01:17:16,738
I'm buying it back from you.

999
01:17:24,641 --> 01:17:25,747
Let's get going, boy.

1000
01:17:30,669 --> 01:17:31,838
My shoulder...

1001
01:17:56,922 --> 01:17:58,300
Ever seen it, Kinch?

1002
01:17:59,301 --> 01:18:01,138
Touch it. Pick it up.

1003
01:18:05,517 --> 01:18:08,408
You've seen it, Kinch,
in a town in Wyoming,

1004
01:18:08,528 --> 01:18:11,351
Altar told you!
- I'm gonna kill you, Kinch.

1005
01:18:11,471 --> 01:18:13,433
Wilson, Geary!

1006
01:18:15,239 --> 01:18:17,279
This is a private affair. Keep out of it.

1007
01:18:21,139 --> 01:18:23,769
You got business upstate.
Get out of town.

1008
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:29,214
Don't go. Altar gave me away,
she's squealing on us!

1009
01:18:29,527 --> 01:18:30,696
Get out!

1010
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:49,089
I'm gonna kill you,
but I'm not gonna murder you.

1011
01:18:50,404 --> 01:18:51,990
I'll give you an even chance.

1012
01:18:53,915 --> 01:18:55,167
Now go ahead, draw.

1013
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:59,242
I've seen you working with a gun.
You learned Frenchy's draw.

1014
01:18:59,362 --> 01:19:01,120
You can't make me fight.

1015
01:19:08,058 --> 01:19:08,997
Draw!

1016
01:19:14,689 --> 01:19:15,587
Draw!

1017
01:19:17,893 --> 01:19:18,936
All right.

1018
01:19:22,736 --> 01:19:23,613
Draw!

1019
01:19:26,013 --> 01:19:27,917
Take your guns out
and hold them at your sides.

1020
01:19:28,747 --> 01:19:29,707
Do it!

1021
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:37,210
Bartender...

1022
01:19:38,285 --> 01:19:42,020
When you say go, that's it.
Maybe you'll have the guts to shoot.

1023
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:44,970
I didn't mean to do it! She yelled.

1024
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:46,816
She hadn't yelled,
all been all right.

1025
01:19:46,936 --> 01:19:48,407
She yelled, I tell you.

1026
01:19:48,527 --> 01:19:50,390
Let's see how you like it, Kinch.
Yell!

1027
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:53,416
Yell. The longer
you yell, the longer you live.

1028
01:19:53,536 --> 01:19:54,934
Come on, I want to hear you.

1029
01:20:00,402 --> 01:20:02,071
What's the quarrel here?

1030
01:20:04,635 --> 01:20:06,325
There's no shooting in my town.

1031
01:20:06,445 --> 01:20:10,368
This man's wanted for murder.
A girl named Beth Forbes,

1032
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:15,033
in a town called Whitmore
in Wyoming, August 10th last year.

1033
01:20:15,689 --> 01:20:16,713
Is that true?

1034
01:20:17,683 --> 01:20:19,529
I heard him admit it, Sheriff.

1035
01:20:20,218 --> 01:20:21,919
Thanks, mister.

1036
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:24,688
I've got a special fondness
for rats that kill women.

1037
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:31,932
I'll need you for a witness.
You'll stay? - Yes.

1038
01:20:32,412 --> 01:20:33,351
Come on.

1039
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:20,284
Turn that man loose,

1040
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:22,188
and don't make any noise.

1041
01:21:22,308 --> 01:21:24,102
This man is my prisoner.

1042
01:21:25,637 --> 01:21:28,141
We got business with somebody
that squealed on him.

1043
01:21:35,162 --> 01:21:36,774
<i>Rio, Gonzales,</i>

1044
01:21:39,075 --> 01:21:40,348
<i>Gonzales, Harvbin.</i>

1045
01:21:51,304 --> 01:21:52,305
Altar!

1046
01:21:56,409 --> 01:21:57,390
Altar?

1047
01:21:59,101 --> 01:22:00,009
Altar!

1048
01:22:01,407 --> 01:22:02,633
What's going on?

1049
01:22:03,152 --> 01:22:05,205
Where's Harbin and Gonzales
and the others?

1050
01:22:05,678 --> 01:22:06,771
I sent them away.

1051
01:22:07,952 --> 01:22:09,296
Is your shoulder bad?

1052
01:22:10,236 --> 01:22:12,469
Bad enough to bring me
back instead of going on.

1053
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:16,205
You sent them away? There isn't
a horse in the corral. What happened?

1054
01:22:16,325 --> 01:22:19,205
The hands are taking them
to Silver City to sell them.

1055
01:22:20,373 --> 01:22:21,844
There's a note for you.

1056
01:22:23,253 --> 01:22:26,025
It's the deed for the ranch.
The money's in the safe.

1057
01:22:27,111 --> 01:22:28,477
I'm leaving, Frenchy.

1058
01:22:29,988 --> 01:22:31,553
Has Vern been here?

1059
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:34,703
You're doing this on account of him?
- Yes.

1060
01:22:35,883 --> 01:22:37,586
- Yes.
- You're not going away.

1061
01:22:38,898 --> 01:22:41,710
You've belonged to me ever since
I've known you. You'll stay here.

1062
01:22:42,357 --> 01:22:44,747
- You don't like to lose, do you?
- No, I don't.

1063
01:22:45,414 --> 01:22:49,484
I've not got much left.I might
as well turn myself in to the marshal.

1064
01:22:50,039 --> 01:22:53,683
Forget it.
You won't go to Vern.

1065
01:22:53,803 --> 01:22:56,287
He wouldn't have me
because I belong to you

1066
01:22:59,765 --> 01:23:02,332
Because of you and everything
you mean.

1067
01:23:03,062 --> 01:23:04,085
You and the ranch.

1068
01:23:04,959 --> 01:23:06,357
I don't believe you!

1069
01:23:06,649 --> 01:23:08,110
I don't believe a word of you!

1070
01:23:08,835 --> 01:23:12,087
Where are you going?
- Away from here.

1071
01:23:12,207 --> 01:23:15,705
To Baldy Gunder's
or any saloon that'll have me.

1072
01:23:15,825 --> 01:23:17,098
I'll kill you before you do.

1073
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:21,885
Hello, Frenchy.

1074
01:23:23,889 --> 01:23:25,600
You and Altar been packing long?

1075
01:23:27,416 --> 01:23:30,191
Place sure looks deserted.
Looks like people are moving.

1076
01:23:30,594 --> 01:23:32,550
What's going on?
- Planning to leave?

1077
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:36,452
Altar was taking a trip, but she'll
change her mind.Nobody's leaving.

1078
01:23:36,572 --> 01:23:39,201
Her mind don't matter.
We got our own plans for her.

1079
01:23:39,321 --> 01:23:41,923
She told Vern her brooch came from

1080
01:23:42,043 --> 01:23:44,311
his girl that I shot in a hold-up.

1081
01:23:44,431 --> 01:23:46,875
No telling what other things
she told him about all of us.

1082
01:23:49,045 --> 01:23:51,341
I told him where I got
the brooch, that's all.

1083
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:54,582
I believe that.

1084
01:23:54,702 --> 01:23:57,399
Once they start talking
they don't stop.

1085
01:23:57,519 --> 01:23:59,877
Ain't a marshal
wouldn't pay for what she knows.

1086
01:24:00,392 --> 01:24:03,399
We took a lot from you. You wiped
your boots on us a long time.

1087
01:24:03,519 --> 01:24:05,927
Too bad Preacher ain't here
to read over you.

1088
01:24:08,971 --> 01:24:10,734
You can get her and me,
but I tell you,

1089
01:24:11,778 --> 01:24:14,044
some of you are gonna die doing it.

1090
01:24:15,211 --> 01:24:19,162
Here's where you're wrong, Frenchy.
The rifle on that window sill

1091
01:24:19,517 --> 01:24:22,517
is aimed at your back,
and Wilson's behind it.

1092
01:24:23,185 --> 01:24:25,188
If you think I'm gonna turn around,
you're mistaken.

1093
01:24:25,583 --> 01:24:27,774
Alright, you tell him!

1094
01:24:34,425 --> 01:24:35,322
It's there, Frenchy.

1095
01:24:36,198 --> 01:24:38,807
You can get one of us, maybe two.

1096
01:24:39,655 --> 01:24:41,721
But there'll still be three left
to settle with her.

1097
01:24:45,007 --> 01:24:48,492
You've got the odds. Let us leave,
and Chuck-A-Luck's yours.

1098
01:24:49,496 --> 01:24:52,334
Not a chance!
We got the odds, we call the plays.

1099
01:24:52,454 --> 01:24:54,077
The odds are changed.

1100
01:24:58,179 --> 01:25:01,431
There is a rifle on this sill
but there's nobody back of it.

1101
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:03,978
I hogtied Wilson.

1102
01:25:05,215 --> 01:25:08,033
I was riding 500 yards behind you.

1103
01:25:08,513 --> 01:25:11,895
All of us were heading for the
same spot with different reasons.

1104
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:15,055
For you, I figure
they did a job on the sheriff,

1105
01:25:15,415 --> 01:25:17,595
but all your friends won't help you now.

1106
01:25:18,572 --> 01:25:21,603
The others are yours, Frenchy.
I don't care what you do with them.

1107
01:25:21,723 --> 01:25:24,833
It's up to you whether
you turn 'em loose or hang 'em.

1108
01:25:25,125 --> 01:25:27,924
Shooting's better than they deserve.

1109
01:25:28,321 --> 01:25:30,700
First I want your word on something.

1110
01:25:31,253 --> 01:25:32,573
Keep them here a while.

1111
01:25:33,194 --> 01:25:35,614
I'll take Kinch to jail personally.

1112
01:25:37,263 --> 01:25:38,898
Give me an hour's start.

1113
01:25:39,685 --> 01:25:42,168
Vern, maybe we can work out a deal.

1114
01:25:42,606 --> 01:25:44,485
If you're willing to talk it over, Kinch...

1115
01:25:54,438 --> 01:25:55,774
Watch out! The window!

1116
01:26:06,612 --> 01:26:07,890
Stop! Stop shooting!

1117
01:26:08,010 --> 01:26:09,304
Throw out your guns!

1118
01:26:13,352 --> 01:26:14,313
Comanche...

1119
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:19,561
Go on, get started.

1120
01:26:45,282 --> 01:26:47,598
Pick a direction
and don't come back.

1121
01:26:48,172 --> 01:26:50,959
That sheriff will have a posse
if he finds out.

1122
01:26:51,079 --> 01:26:53,166
I can't fight.
We'll be caught.

1123
01:26:54,565 --> 01:26:56,651
That's your problem.
Take your chances.

1124
01:27:07,765 --> 01:27:09,955
Once the posse gets them,
they'll come for you.

1125
01:27:10,388 --> 01:27:12,709
They're welcome to me.
We all get taken, sooner or later.

1126
01:27:14,295 --> 01:27:16,932
First, there's a matter
you and I have got to settle.

1127
01:28:08,596 --> 01:28:10,655
She stepped in front of that
bullet to save you.

1128
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:29,367
<i>Two men rode away
from Chuck-A-Luck</i>

1129
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:33,460
<i>And Death rode beside them
on the trail</i>

1130
01:28:33,794 --> 01:28:38,095
<i>They died that day,
so the legends tell</i>

1131
01:28:38,659 --> 01:28:43,582
<i>With empty guns,
they fought and fell</i>

1132
01:28:44,459 --> 01:28:48,403
<i>And so ends the tale
</i>

1133
01:28:48,722 --> 01:28:52,144
<i>of hate, murder</i>

1134
01:28:52,264 --> 01:28:55,001
<i> and revenge!</i>
