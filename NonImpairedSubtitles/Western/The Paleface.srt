1
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,158
I don't know who you are, but
thanks. I'm goin' this way.

2
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,759
You're comin'
with us!

3
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,210
Calamity Jane.

4
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:02,214
All right, boys.
Wait outside.

5
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:06,378
Jane, I'm Governor Johnson. This is
commissioner of Indian affairs, Mr. Emerson...

6
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:10,684
and his secretary,
Mr. Martin.

7
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:14,352
I'll come right to the point.
We staged that jailbreak.

8
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:17,396
We wanted it to look as
if your friends broke you out.

9
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:20,432
We have a job for you which
requires absolute secrecy.

10
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,401
How 'bout that point
you were comin' to?

11
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,802
A group of white renegades is
smuggling guns to the Indians.

12
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,809
We've got to find out who they are
before we have an Indian war on our hands.

13
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:35,314
Six months ago we sent two of our best agents.
Their bodies were found horribly mutilated.

14
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:40,375
We thought we'd send a woman. A
woman who can take care of herself.

15
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,120
Like me, for instance?
Yes, Jane, like you.

16
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,785
We need your help
desperately.

17
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,070
What's the price tag
on this?

18
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:06,111
Jane, you're facing a
jail sentence of ten years.

19
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:11,139
You get those men for us, and we'll
give you a pardon. A full pardon.

20
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:15,347
Gentlemen, I'd like to go on record
as saying we can't trust this, this-

21
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,322
Criminal.
I think we can.

22
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,459
Here's proof
of my confidence.

23
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,101
Well, it's mighty nice
of you. Reach!

24
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,278
Thanks for the drink,
Governor.

25
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,945
Jane, outside that window
there's no pardon.

26
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,821
Unless you help us, the West will be
graced with the blood of white settlers.

27
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:55,156
Thousands olives.
Women and children.

28
00:04:56,262 --> 00:05:00,164
You could stand
a little practice, son.

29
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,895
I'll take a look
at that pardon.

30
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,602
Keep talkin'. You'll
take the stage tonight.

31
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,172
At Fort Deerfield, contact
a lawyer named Jim Hunter.

32
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,879
There's a wagon train going west. You'll
join it. Hunter will pose as your husband.

33
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:24,116
As man and wife, you'll be lost
in the crowd on that wagon train.

34
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,490
You'll get further instructions from
Hunter. We're dependin' on you, Jane.

35
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,893
I'm depending on you.

36
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:34,296
And I wouldn't advise you
to cross me up, gents.

37
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,597
So she finally
agreed to go.

38
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:46,338
She'll be traveling as a lady,
but she's a killer.

39
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,438
A dead shot.
I found that out.

40
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:54,248
We'll get her. But get her when you're
sure she can't beat you to the draw.

41
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:56,771
Mr. Hunter.

42
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,616
Mr. Hunter.

43
00:08:57,369 --> 00:09:01,965
Take a seat over there, dearie.
There'll be one ready in a minute.

44
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:16,054
Now, we'll take a- if you don't
mind my telling you, it's the one-

45
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:19,113
Please, no clues.
You'll spoil all the fun.

46
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,853
Pardon me.

47
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:26,489
One can detect an ailing tooth by the dull
sound that comes from it when struck by a hammer.

48
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:30,296
Hmm, that seems logical.
Yeah, here we go, please.

49
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,866
Ahh.
Ah, that's it!

50
00:09:37,943 --> 00:09:41,674
There's the little doll
right there. Now, we'll jus-

51
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,181
Stand by.

52
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:48,982
After discovering the ailing tooth, the
next thing is to drill away the decay.

53
00:09:49,054 --> 00:09:52,182
It doesn't seem logical,
but I'm game.

54
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:56,421
Well... now.
Open. Open wide.

55
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,388
This won't hurt us
a bit.

56
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,594
Where'd you go?

57
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:07,105
Steady now.
Wide.

58
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:10,369
Where's the guy who calls
himself a painless dentist?

59
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:14,173
Hey, I got a tooth that's
killing me. Sit down, you're next.

60
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:17,215
I'll sit down.

61
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:20,410
Uh, uh. Oh, that's
what I say, you're next.

62
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,684
That'll be two dollars, please.
Never mind the two dollars.

63
00:10:24,756 --> 00:10:27,122
Thanks. You're welcome. Hey.

64
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:29,353
Hurry up!

65
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,958
Open wide.

66
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:38,127
That's a happy
little dungeon.

67
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:40,603
Hmm.
Hmm.

68
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:43,835
There's an echo in here.
Well, now-

69
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,844
Never mind about that. When a
tooth's no good, you pull it!

70
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:50,575
Please, I'm the dentist.
I know what I'm doing.

71
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,615
What do you know,
he's right.

72
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:59,156
Well, now.
All right, open wide.

73
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,227
Oh.
It's all right.

74
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:07,493
We'll get right into
the important stuff here.

75
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:11,866
Real wide now. Get something
- I thought you were gonna pull it.

76
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,804
Well, I have to dig a little
toehold for the pliers.

77
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:17,501
This won't hurt us at all.
Just-

78
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:20,010
Please, no singing.

79
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:23,172
Got a tonsil. I'm sorry.

80
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:25,716
Hmm?

81
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:30,517
Ah, got hair on the
inside too. There you are.

82
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,683
Nothing to it at all. Starting
to burn a little wood here.

83
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,455
Steady now.

84
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:43,465
We're getting warm. There
you are. There you are.

85
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:46,971
Now, if you just-

86
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,234
Wha- -

87
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:53,540
Would you mind moving your tongue over a
little? I didn't think you were that tough.

88
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:57,673
Let me see here.

89
00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:01,082
Ah, ah, ah, don't swallow
it. Don't swallow it, please.

90
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,782
That's funny. I have one
just like it. I- Oh.

91
00:12:04,856 --> 00:12:08,587
Hungry little thing, you.
I wa- -

92
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,924
Well.

93
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,191
So that's what
Horace Greeley meant.

94
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:16,962
I'll be with you in a minute. You've got
just the kind of mouth I'd like to work on.

95
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:19,560
I- -
Listen, weasel!

96
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,903
I came here to get
a tooth pulled. This one.

97
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:26,433
The one next to the gold one.
Sawy? I know. We'll find it.

98
00:12:26,511 --> 00:12:29,139
Don't worry about a thing. It's a
cinch. We'll get to it sooner or later.

99
00:12:29,214 --> 00:12:32,741
I'm a very sensitive man.
Don't hurt me. Just relax.

100
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,912
What's that? It's laughing gas. That's
why they call me Painless Potter.

101
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,354
I use it on all my patients. Is it safe?

102
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:41,881
Safest thing in the world! Would
you mind paying me now? Come on!

103
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,690
The one next to the gold one. Okay.

104
00:12:56,274 --> 00:13:00,176
Is it coming through?
Feel anything?

105
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:03,078
Hmm? Must be a leak around here.

106
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:20,158
Is it doing it to you?
Huh?

107
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:23,895
Bye-bye.

108
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,950
Come on, dearie.
You're next.

109
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,632
What do you know,
I pulled the wrong tooth.

110
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,407
I got the one
with the nugget in it.

111
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:14,316
So you pulled
the wrong tooth.

112
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:18,220
How about that!

113
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,920
I'm gonna give you just 15
minutes to get out of town.

114
00:14:22,994 --> 00:14:26,259
Last town they gave me
20 minutes.

115
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:45,177
And that scooped-nose quack
pulled the wrong tooth.

116
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,453
She can't take a bath
with her guns on. Come on.

117
00:14:57,295 --> 00:15:01,254
Will somebody come in here
and scrub my back?

118
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,962
Put it in number four.

119
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:08,437
This is the ladies' side. Come
on, come on, get out of here.

120
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,820
You lookin'
for someone?

121
00:15:51,114 --> 00:15:53,981
Who did the shooting?

122
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,780
Who are they? Never saw them before.

123
00:15:56,853 --> 00:15:59,481
They must be strangers.
Look out! Look out!

124
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:01,524
I wonder who did
the shooting.

125
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:05,322
It's Lance! He's still alive.
Anybody got any whiskey?

126
00:16:05,395 --> 00:16:07,454
Dad's got some.
Yeah, here.

127
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,225
Lance.

128
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:13,099
Doc, get up!
Get up!

129
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:16,627
Say, I must be running out of
customers. I'm pullin' my own teeth.

130
00:16:16,706 --> 00:16:20,574
Oh, get up, Doc, hurry!
They're shootin' upstairs! Huh?

131
00:16:20,643 --> 00:16:24,044
Come on and do something! Shootin'?
I'll do something all right.

132
00:16:24,114 --> 00:16:29,552
I'm outta here. I'm goin' back east where men
may not be men but they're not corpses either.

133
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:31,849
I've had enough.

134
00:16:34,557 --> 00:16:37,492
Don't give
your right names.

135
00:16:53,777 --> 00:16:57,008
Warm up, kids.
We're movin' again.

136
00:17:02,485 --> 00:17:07,548
Federal agent
joinin'...

137
00:17:07,624 --> 00:17:11,287
wagon train,
Buffalo Flats.

138
00:17:20,637 --> 00:17:23,765
Giddyap.
Get me out of this.

139
00:17:32,248 --> 00:17:35,012
Ha!

140
00:17:45,695 --> 00:17:49,563
Hey. Wait, I've been chased by women
before but not while I was awake.

141
00:17:49,632 --> 00:17:53,295
I'll take over now! Yeah, you drive
a while. Who wants to watch the road?

142
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:57,237
I'm gonna join that wagon train.
Come on! Head 'em any way you like.

143
00:17:57,307 --> 00:18:01,368
What am I sayin'? That's Indian
country. You're not afraid of Indians?

144
00:18:01,444 --> 00:18:04,880
It's not the Indians, it's their
attitudes. They're hatchet happy.

145
00:18:04,948 --> 00:18:08,748
I'm headin' back home, Washington,
D.C. I'm gonna join that wagon train.

146
00:18:08,818 --> 00:18:11,446
You can't join 'em
without a wagon.

147
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:15,924
Make up your mind.
Are you going with me?

148
00:18:22,665 --> 00:18:25,896
You got yourself
a traveling companion.

149
00:18:27,437 --> 00:18:29,837
Keep traveling.

150
00:18:35,612 --> 00:18:40,140
Boy, can you kiss!

151
00:18:42,152 --> 00:18:47,749
Sorry I had to do that, son,
but this is a big job.

152
00:18:47,824 --> 00:18:51,089
There's a wagon train going
west. You'll both join it.

153
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:53,391
Hunter will pose
as your husband.

154
00:18:53,463 --> 00:18:56,830
It's not speed that we're
interested in, it's secrecy.

155
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,098
As man and wife, you'll be lost
in the crowd on that wagon train.

156
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:23,316
You wouldn't let a girl go on
a wagon train alone, would you?

157
00:19:23,393 --> 00:19:27,921
Painless, you're just the man
I've been hoping to meet.

158
00:19:27,997 --> 00:19:32,229
Painless, there's something
about you that appeals to me.

159
00:19:32,302 --> 00:19:37,296
Wake up, stupid.
I'm proposing to you.

160
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:39,841
I'm in love with you.

161
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:42,810
I said,
I'm in love with you.

162
00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:46,315
And I want to marry you.
Come on.

163
00:19:47,684 --> 00:19:51,415
What's goin' on? Why,
sure, I'll marry you, dear.

164
00:19:51,487 --> 00:19:53,182
Huh?

165
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:57,920
I knew the moment your lips touched
mine that we were meant for each other.

166
00:19:57,994 --> 00:20:00,758
Oh, you did?

167
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:04,266
Let me hear you say it again.
Tell me you'll marry me.

168
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:07,269
Me?

169
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:10,033
Tell me you'll marry me.

170
00:20:10,106 --> 00:20:13,200
The way you kiss,
how can I refuse?

171
00:20:15,912 --> 00:20:20,281
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

172
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,183
The ring, please.

173
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:34,221
The wedding ring is a token of the
solemn vows you have just taken.

174
00:20:34,297 --> 00:20:39,132
This ring is a symbol of your
affection, sincerity and fidelity.

175
00:21:03,926 --> 00:21:08,386
Ah! At last. And now, the kiss.

176
00:21:10,566 --> 00:21:13,296
Not me, you fool!
Her!

177
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:44,730
Well, howdy, folks. Welcome.
Uh, what's your handle?

178
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:47,599
Mr. And Mrs. Painless
Peter Potter. I'm Mr.

179
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,798
Glad to have you with us. Yeah,
just make yourselves to home, folks.

180
00:21:50,873 --> 00:21:54,809
Oh, thank you.

181
00:21:54,877 --> 00:21:58,813
I'll unhitch the horses
and then we can... talk?

182
00:21:58,881 --> 00:22:02,214
Well, I'll unhitch
the horses.

183
00:22:10,326 --> 00:22:14,387
Come on, let’s play
hide-and-seek.

184
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:23,862
Hey,Jimmy, where are ya?
Here I am!

185
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,233
Look!

186
00:22:28,444 --> 00:22:31,436
What are you tryin' to do?
Blow yourself up-

187
00:22:31,514 --> 00:22:34,608
Shut up! Go on, you kids.
Get outta here.

188
00:22:37,787 --> 00:22:40,950
I told you to keep that canvas
lashed down tight.

189
00:22:43,893 --> 00:22:46,862
Good thing
he didn't see it.

190
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:51,423
Uh-huh. Just as I thought. That
wisdom tooth has gotta come out.

191
00:22:51,501 --> 00:22:54,231
He don't look like
no federal agent to me.

192
00:22:54,303 --> 00:22:57,101
But that's the wagon that left
town right after the killin'.

193
00:22:57,173 --> 00:22:59,266
I can see you 10:30,
Tuesday.

194
00:23:09,218 --> 00:23:12,085
Painless.

195
00:23:12,155 --> 00:23:15,488
That's my wife.
A filly to you.

196
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:19,119
From now on, I probably won't
have a minute to myself. Painless.

197
00:23:19,195 --> 00:23:24,531
Yes? Oh, what are you doing to
that poor girl, you glorious beast?

198
00:23:26,969 --> 00:23:30,029
Yes, darling. Would you loosen
my stays a little, honey?

199
00:23:30,106 --> 00:23:34,634
Well, it's not my regular work, but I
- Here, maybe I can work it out better this way.

200
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:39,147
Now you can't do it like
that! Well, it was an idea.

201
00:23:39,215 --> 00:23:42,309
Say, they're rugged, aren't
they? Made of whalebone.

202
00:23:42,385 --> 00:23:44,353
Just call me
Moby Dick.

203
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,615
Hey, you know,
it's a funny thing.

204
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:50,591
We've been married two hours and this
is the closest I've gotten to you.

205
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:56,189
Well, you're so strong, silent
and unapproachable. You wanna bet?

206
00:23:56,265 --> 00:24:00,201
Tell me something about
yourself. You seem so mysterious.

207
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:03,261
All I know is that you
came from Washington, D.C.

208
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:06,433
I'm sure there are a lot
of things you haven't told me.

209
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:10,969
I'll unload a little information at a time.
That's the way to keep a girl interested.

210
00:24:11,047 --> 00:24:13,345
Who tied these for ya,
a sailor?

211
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:17,682
And another thing, you never told me why
you left Fort Deerfield in such a hurry.

212
00:24:17,753 --> 00:24:20,688
Well, I had a little trouble,
but it's all cleared up now.

213
00:24:20,756 --> 00:24:24,487
There. Hey, why worry about my
past? Let's work out our future.

214
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:28,195
That's our man,
all right.

215
00:24:28,264 --> 00:24:31,722
Going west in a covered wagon.
That's my kind of life.

216
00:24:31,801 --> 00:24:36,238
Blazing new frontiers, facing
danger, privation and death.

217
00:24:36,305 --> 00:24:39,741
Is that my kind of life?
Now, remember, Painless,

218
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:43,768
you promised to love, honor and protect
me. Let's do it in the order named.

219
00:24:43,846 --> 00:24:46,679
All right, get movin', folks.
We'll get a good early start.

220
00:24:46,749 --> 00:24:51,812
The sooner we get past that Indian
country, the better. Indian country?

221
00:24:51,888 --> 00:24:56,518
Do we have to go that way?
Now, Painless, I'll be with you.

222
00:24:58,461 --> 00:25:01,521
You're not afraid, are you? No.

223
00:25:01,597 --> 00:25:04,657
I can always get
another scalp.

224
00:25:04,734 --> 00:25:07,498
Let's go.
Yeah.

225
00:25:13,276 --> 00:25:15,870
All right, folks,
let's get goin'!

226
00:25:18,514 --> 00:25:21,176
Ya-hoo!

227
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,241
Ya-hoo!

228
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:31,993
My husband!

229
00:25:43,272 --> 00:25:46,537
We'll take this trail to
the right. Yeah, we better.

230
00:25:46,609 --> 00:25:49,703
That one leads deep into
Indian country. Let's get goin'.

231
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:53,078
We got a long haul
before night. All right.

232
00:26:12,969 --> 00:26:16,598
# A western ranch
is just a branch #

233
00:26:16,673 --> 00:26:20,040
# Of nowhere junction
to me #

234
00:26:20,109 --> 00:26:23,010
# Gimme the city where
living's pretty #

235
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:26,480
# And the gals
wear finery #

236
00:26:28,318 --> 00:26:31,116
# East is east
and west is west #

237
00:26:31,187 --> 00:26:34,679
# And the wrong one
I have chose #

238
00:26:34,757 --> 00:26:37,658
# Let's go where
you keep on wearin' #

239
00:26:37,727 --> 00:26:41,060
# Those frills and flowers
and buttons and bows #

240
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:45,089
# Rings and things
and buttons and bows #

241
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,533
# Don't bury me
in this prairie #

242
00:26:50,607 --> 00:26:53,633
# Take me where
the cement grows #

243
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,907
# Let's move down
to some big town #

244
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,972
# Where they love a gal
by the cut of her clothes #

245
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:05,316
# And you'll stand out
in buttons and bows #

246
00:27:06,656 --> 00:27:09,853
# I love you in buckskin #

247
00:27:09,926 --> 00:27:12,895
# Or skirts
that you've homespun #

248
00:27:12,962 --> 00:27:19,231
# But I love you longer stronger
where your friends don't tote a gun #

249
00:27:19,302 --> 00:27:22,499
# My bones denounce
the buckboard bounce #

250
00:27:22,572 --> 00:27:25,564
# And the cactus
hurts my toes #

251
00:27:25,642 --> 00:27:28,702
# Let's vamoose
where gals keep usin'#

252
00:27:28,778 --> 00:27:32,236
# Those silks and satins
and linen that shows #

253
00:27:32,315 --> 00:27:36,081
# And you're all mine
in buttons and bows #

254
00:27:38,488 --> 00:27:41,616
# Gimme eastern trimmin'
where women are women #

255
00:27:41,691 --> 00:27:44,854
# In high silk hose
and peekaboo clothes #

256
00:27:44,927 --> 00:27:47,953
# And French perfume
that rocks the room #

257
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:50,397
# And you're all mine in #

258
00:27:52,468 --> 00:27:55,460
# Bows #

259
00:27:56,439 --> 00:28:08,412
# Buttons and bows #

260
00:28:47,123 --> 00:28:51,457
Shh. Can't you see
she's sleeping?

261
00:29:01,938 --> 00:29:04,873
Come on! Come on, you're
laggin' way behind.

262
00:29:04,941 --> 00:29:09,275
Come on. First chance I get, I'm
tradin' you in for a pair of turtles.

263
00:29:09,345 --> 00:29:12,337
Giddap, Stanislaus.
Come on, Clifton.

264
00:29:18,855 --> 00:29:22,951
All you had to do was follow
the wagon in front of you.

265
00:29:23,025 --> 00:29:27,189
I think we’re going in the wrong
direction. Maybe this is a shortcut.

266
00:29:27,263 --> 00:29:30,596
Maybe we're way ahead
of them. Oh, shut up.

267
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:32,600
Yes, ma'am.

268
00:29:35,471 --> 00:29:40,033
I guess we can stay in this house for the
night. We'll get our bearings in the morning.

269
00:29:40,109 --> 00:29:43,704
Night? Morning?
Yes, ma'am.

270
00:29:49,886 --> 00:29:54,084
We're bedding down here for the
night. Take 'em back to the corral.

271
00:29:57,927 --> 00:30:01,055
Hurry. Quickly. Bring
your own blankets. Come on.

272
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:03,428
Come on, gramps.
We'll help you.

273
00:30:03,499 --> 00:30:06,593
Look what I found, Ma.

274
00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:10,537
Oh Jimmy, keep your hands off of
things. Come on, hurry up, get in.

275
00:30:10,606 --> 00:30:13,166
Is it all right in there?
Pretty good. Come on.

276
00:30:13,242 --> 00:30:17,576
You kids make up
your own beds now.

277
00:30:17,647 --> 00:30:21,014
All right, it's the best
we can do.

278
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:26,385
Gee, it's dark in here.
I'm scared.

279
00:30:26,455 --> 00:30:29,549
Put that down, Johnny.
Must be the maid's day off.

280
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:31,559
Mm-hmm.

281
00:30:31,627 --> 00:30:34,323
Looks like a likely
spot. Hey, kraut face.

282
00:30:34,397 --> 00:30:37,628
Ladies first,
then me.

283
00:30:39,468 --> 00:30:44,770
Well, this looks like it.
Alley-oop.

284
00:30:44,841 --> 00:30:48,834
Just think, some day there'll be a sign on
that door, "Painless Potter slept here. "

285
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:52,938
Well, don't put it up yet.
No, I got my hands full now.

286
00:30:55,651 --> 00:30:58,017
Tomorrow night,
you carry me.

287
00:31:01,157 --> 00:31:05,025
Isn't the moonlight Romantic?
Yeah. Light the candle.

288
00:31:07,797 --> 00:31:11,062
Candle light's
Romantic too.

289
00:31:14,337 --> 00:31:17,738
We don't want
any dust to blow in.

290
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,835
Painless.

291
00:31:46,903 --> 00:31:49,736
Yes?

292
00:31:49,805 --> 00:31:52,933
Would you get me
a drink of cold water, please?

293
00:31:53,009 --> 00:31:56,501
Water? Cold?

294
00:31:56,579 --> 00:32:00,447
Cold water.
Well, that adds up.

295
00:32:00,516 --> 00:32:04,680
All right. If I'm not back in three
minutes, you'll know I fell in the well.

296
00:32:06,422 --> 00:32:08,856
Excuse me.

297
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,317
Thank you.

298
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:50,382
It's your husband,
darling.

299
00:33:53,896 --> 00:33:56,126
Yoo-hoo.

300
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,294
I'm back, honey.

301
00:34:01,737 --> 00:34:05,104
I got your cold water.

302
00:34:05,174 --> 00:34:09,577
My, your blushing right down to
your little tootsies, aren't ya?

303
00:34:09,645 --> 00:34:12,614
Here you are, cuddles.

304
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,714
There you are.
I'm sorry.

305
00:34:16,786 --> 00:34:20,085
My, but you're
an odd girl.

306
00:34:25,928 --> 00:34:29,125
Gee, I'm glad I picked a wife
with a sense of humor.

307
00:34:29,198 --> 00:34:31,257
Uh, is everything
all right?

308
00:34:32,635 --> 00:34:35,763
My, but you're a muscular
little thing, aren't you?

309
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:38,864
Those dresses
are awfully deceiving.

310
00:34:38,941 --> 00:34:41,603
Smooth, smooth.

311
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,274
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to tickle you.

312
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:50,841
Isn't that sweet? You put
your hair up in braids.

313
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,650
Aw, that's nice.
Come on out, Mrs. Potter.

314
00:34:53,722 --> 00:34:57,783
I know, you're modest. But it's
all right. I'll keep my eyes closed.

315
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,158
Come on, doll.

316
00:35:00,229 --> 00:35:03,426
Ahh.

317
00:35:03,499 --> 00:35:08,095
Now come close to me, wifey.
Come close to me.

318
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:10,695
Boy, can you kiss!

319
00:35:38,299 --> 00:35:40,529
Wake up.

320
00:35:42,904 --> 00:35:45,998
Oh, good morning, honey.
You got up early.

321
00:35:46,073 --> 00:35:49,406
Start moving. We gotta
get out of here. Yeah?

322
00:35:51,379 --> 00:35:53,438
Say,

323
00:35:53,514 --> 00:35:57,917
I don't know what happened last
night, but thanks for a lovely evening.

324
00:35:57,985 --> 00:36:01,648
Well, you're sure
easy to please.

325
00:36:01,722 --> 00:36:05,123
Boy, I can't get over
your kisses.

326
00:36:05,193 --> 00:36:07,855
Hoo-hoo!

327
00:36:10,965 --> 00:36:13,763
I think I married
a mental case.

328
00:37:02,383 --> 00:37:06,581
Must be a Virginia creeper.

329
00:37:17,064 --> 00:37:20,522
I gotta make myself pretty.
I owe it to the little woman.

330
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:34,307
Ha!
I'm shavin' too close.

331
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:38,580
Boy, I'm certainly
a nervous wreck.

332
00:37:38,653 --> 00:37:40,780
It's an arrow.

333
00:37:42,623 --> 00:37:46,559
Someone had to shoot it.
Who shoots arrows? Cupid?

334
00:37:46,627 --> 00:37:49,687
No, it couldn't be Cupid.
William Tell?

335
00:37:49,764 --> 00:37:53,291
No, that's silly. Couldn't
be William Tell. No apple.

336
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:56,859
Indians. Yeah.
Indians.

337
00:37:56,938 --> 00:38:02,399
Could be... Indians.
Indians! Oh!

338
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,178
Love,
let me in!

339
00:38:08,249 --> 00:38:10,979
Open up! Open up!
Look, it's me!

340
00:38:11,052 --> 00:38:14,283
Oh! They want to make a
pincushion out of me! Open up!

341
00:38:14,355 --> 00:38:18,689
Pick up those guns and take care
of yourself. You're too young to be a widow.

342
00:38:18,759 --> 00:38:24,129
Take care of myself? Look, there's a
million Indians out here against one coward!

343
00:38:28,202 --> 00:38:30,830
I hope they're loaded.
I wish I was too.

344
00:38:40,214 --> 00:38:43,183
I got him!
I think.

345
00:38:54,095 --> 00:38:59,294
It's a cinch. Ha!
There's a pile for you. Ooh!

346
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:03,303
We was wrong about that dentist.
He's doin' some mighty fancy shootin'.

347
00:39:19,854 --> 00:39:23,255
Bad bullet.

348
00:39:30,498 --> 00:39:33,831
Let's keep it neat.
Don't- -

349
00:39:38,606 --> 00:39:40,836
They started it.

350
00:39:40,908 --> 00:39:43,741
Say, how come you got lost?
What happened?

351
00:39:43,811 --> 00:39:47,110
I'll tell you what happened.
He saved the whole wagon train!

352
00:39:47,181 --> 00:39:51,345
Yeah, he done it by himself. I never
saw such shootin'. Best shot in the West.

353
00:39:51,419 --> 00:39:56,254
He knowed the Injuns was on your trail, and he
decoyed them away from the rest of the wagon.

354
00:39:56,323 --> 00:40:00,692
I did? Oh, he's right. That's what I
did. I did that. You're a hero, son.

355
00:40:00,761 --> 00:40:02,956
Yeah? You can have my rifle.

356
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:07,330
Oh, thanks, Dad. I'll knock
off a couple of Indians for you.

357
00:40:10,204 --> 00:40:12,764
He's got eyes
in the back of his head.

358
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:17,072
My darling. You never said
anything about being a dead shot.

359
00:40:17,144 --> 00:40:19,704
I told you I'd give you
a little information at a time.

360
00:40:20,614 --> 00:40:23,583
On behalf of the wagon
train, I wanna thank you.

361
00:40:23,651 --> 00:40:26,347
You saved an awful
lot olives.

362
00:40:31,826 --> 00:40:36,286
Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Ladies and
gentlemen, I'd like to say a few words.

363
00:40:36,363 --> 00:40:40,459
Let's get out of here before them
redskins come back. Those are the words.

364
00:40:44,371 --> 00:40:47,670
You lead the way, Doctor. Okay.

365
00:40:47,741 --> 00:40:51,006
Nothin' to be scared of now.
You got the courage of a lion.

366
00:40:51,078 --> 00:40:54,309
Aw, it's nothing. Brave men
run in my family. Hurry up!

367
00:40:54,381 --> 00:40:58,477
- We're off to Buffalo Flats!
- Off to Buffalo Flats! Ya-hoo!

368
00:40:58,552 --> 00:41:00,543
Off to Buffalo Flats!
Ya-hoo!

369
00:41:00,621 --> 00:41:03,385
Off to Buffal- -

370
00:41:08,095 --> 00:41:10,063
Our hero.

371
00:41:32,153 --> 00:41:35,953
# Get a man, get a man
get a man #

372
00:41:39,026 --> 00:41:42,189
# Get a man get a man get a man #

373
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,660
# Get a man get a man get a man #

374
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:53,366
Oh, Mr. Preston. Come in. Come in.

375
00:41:55,709 --> 00:41:59,611
You come at a most inopportune
time. Boss, we got important news.

376
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,614
I'm sure you have.

377
00:42:01,682 --> 00:42:05,812
Somehow I can always sense when
one of my associates bungles a job.

378
00:42:05,886 --> 00:42:08,047
What have you messed up?

379
00:42:08,122 --> 00:42:11,649
There's a new federal agent
coming in on the wagon train.

380
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,754
Why did you
let him through?

381
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,500
Stranger,
I like you.

382
00:42:21,569 --> 00:42:25,096
And I like you, Red.
Pepper, there's Joe!

383
00:42:40,588 --> 00:42:44,285
Next guy that messes around
my gal gets the same thing!

384
00:42:53,534 --> 00:42:57,937
Wagon train's here!

385
00:42:58,005 --> 00:43:02,374
Eddie, drag
the gentleman out.

386
00:43:02,443 --> 00:43:06,038
What's all the excitement
out in front?

387
00:43:06,113 --> 00:43:09,480
They're giving a welcome
to that guy we told you about.

388
00:43:16,023 --> 00:43:20,187
All right, folks, the biggest hero
that this West has ever seen! Yes, sir.

389
00:43:20,261 --> 00:43:22,195
Hooray!

390
00:43:24,331 --> 00:43:27,095
Please, please, it was nothing.
Anyone could have done it.

391
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:30,864
Anyone who was strong,
courageous and a dead shot.

392
00:43:30,938 --> 00:43:33,873
Is that our fearless
federal agent?

393
00:43:33,941 --> 00:43:36,842
Don't let his looks fool ya.
He's a cold-blooded murderer.

394
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:39,777
Calls himself a dentist, Painless
Potter, but that's just a front.

395
00:43:39,847 --> 00:43:43,078
It ain't gonna be easy. He's
got eyes in the back of his head.

396
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:48,816
But we can put him away. Pepper, do you
think you could learn to love a dentist?

397
00:43:48,889 --> 00:43:52,325
A short romance? I don't
think it'd be too difficult.

398
00:43:52,393 --> 00:43:55,521
I'd like to be
in his shoes.

399
00:43:55,596 --> 00:43:59,293
I wonder what
the cowards are doing.

400
00:44:02,369 --> 00:44:04,769
I'll be out in- -

401
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,505
You and your high heels.
May I please shake your hand?

402
00:44:09,576 --> 00:44:13,512
My little boy wants to touch
you. Oh, no. Easy, girls.

403
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,811
I'm tired. I've been
fighting Indians all day.

404
00:44:16,884 --> 00:44:20,047
But I may give you a moment later.
Don't give up. You're so wonderful.

405
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,054
And keep cheering.

406
00:44:22,122 --> 00:44:25,057
What happened
to the band?

407
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:29,186
We're proud to have you as our
guest, sir. Very happy to be here.

408
00:44:29,263 --> 00:44:32,926
Mr. And Mrs. Painless Potter
with baggage. Mr. And Mrs. -

409
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,662
Would you like a boy?

410
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,409
Wooo.

411
00:44:42,476 --> 00:44:45,377
Oh, yes, yes.

412
00:44:55,189 --> 00:44:57,817
Boy!
Yes, sir.

413
00:44:57,891 --> 00:45:02,521
Boy? Will you unhitch my horses, feed
'em some hay and have some for yourself?

414
00:45:02,596 --> 00:45:04,689
Thanks. I never touch
the stuff. All right.

415
00:45:04,765 --> 00:45:08,030
Here you are, sir. Thank you. We're
all set. A room with running water.

416
00:45:08,102 --> 00:45:11,435
They got a guy who'll run for it.
Isn't this wonderful? Painless, wait.

417
00:45:11,505 --> 00:45:15,271
You don't want to leave this. I can
wave to them from the window. Come on.

418
00:45:15,342 --> 00:45:19,711
You're just too modest to
understand. You're a legend now.

419
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:24,183
A hero. A man apart. We've been
apart too long. Come on, honey.

420
00:45:24,251 --> 00:45:26,913
Look outside.

421
00:45:26,987 --> 00:45:32,550
Once that was a forest. Then
it became a trail. Then a town.

422
00:45:32,626 --> 00:45:35,959
And someday, it'll be a city.
That's what I like, progress.

423
00:45:36,029 --> 00:45:37,963
And I'm not makin' any.

424
00:45:38,031 --> 00:45:42,866
Someday, it'll be a city
with a statue of a great man.

425
00:45:42,936 --> 00:45:45,996
And do you know whose statue it'll
be? The guy who invented keys.

426
00:45:46,073 --> 00:45:48,200
Let's use it.
No, no.

427
00:45:48,275 --> 00:45:52,871
It'll be a statue of
Painless Potter. Huh?

428
00:45:52,946 --> 00:45:56,507
And under that statue,
it'll read: "Painless Potter:

429
00:45:56,583 --> 00:46:00,314
"successor to Wild Bill Hickock
and Buffalo Bill Cody.

430
00:46:00,387 --> 00:46:03,879
"The intrepid hero who saved
an entire wagon train...

431
00:46:03,957 --> 00:46:06,824
by killing
11 Indians. "

432
00:46:06,894 --> 00:46:09,362
Twelve.

433
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:13,423
So you see, dear, that's why it wouldn't be
fair for me to take you away from these people...

434
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,765
and not give them a chance
to express their gratitude.

435
00:46:16,837 --> 00:46:19,974
Yeah, I guess
- hey, wait a minute. What's this all about?

436
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:25,574
Well, I might as well come clean,
Painless. Our marriage won't work.

437
00:46:25,646 --> 00:46:29,548
You're a hero now.
I'm just a little nobody.

438
00:46:29,616 --> 00:46:33,017
You belong to the people.
This is the end of the road.

439
00:46:33,087 --> 00:46:35,180
We're through.
Through?

440
00:46:35,255 --> 00:46:38,452
Say, what's goin' on here?
You and I just got together-

441
00:46:38,525 --> 00:46:42,359
You might just as well face it,
Painless. It's over. That's all.

442
00:46:42,429 --> 00:46:45,887
Oh.
Oh, this is great.

443
00:46:45,966 --> 00:46:49,732
I give up my career. I bring
you out here on a wagon train.

444
00:46:49,803 --> 00:46:52,795
Save your life
by killing 13 Indians.

445
00:46:52,873 --> 00:46:56,673
Now you're gonna give me
the kiss off. Oh.

446
00:46:56,744 --> 00:46:59,372
Well, you're not
the only dame.

447
00:46:59,446 --> 00:47:03,041
There are a lot of other fish in the
sea and I'm going out and cast some bait.

448
00:47:03,117 --> 00:47:06,450
Good-bye, Painless. That's all
right. If that's the way you feel.

449
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:10,251
I promise you one thing. You'll come
crawling back to me on your hands and knees!

450
00:47:10,324 --> 00:47:14,556
Do you think I'll be there? Good-bye.

451
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,889
I'll show her.

452
00:47:18,966 --> 00:47:21,127
A fine hero.
Through.

453
00:47:21,201 --> 00:47:23,499
Hi.
Hi.

454
00:47:32,846 --> 00:47:34,780
Hi.
Hi.

455
00:47:38,786 --> 00:47:43,746
Uh, how'd you like a little conversation
with a hero? I'd be tickled to death.

456
00:47:45,526 --> 00:47:48,290
Follow me.

457
00:47:54,835 --> 00:47:57,326
You Hank Billings?

458
00:47:57,404 --> 00:48:00,931
That's what the sign says.

459
00:48:03,477 --> 00:48:06,071
I just came in
on the wagon train.

460
00:48:06,146 --> 00:48:09,604
Before I left Fort Deerfield, I saw
a friend of yours, name of Hunter.

461
00:48:09,683 --> 00:48:12,083
Jim Hunter.

462
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:20,889
Seems a shame a man like Hunter getting
killed just so you can play cagey.

463
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:28,190
Hot trip
from Fort Deerfield.

464
00:48:29,536 --> 00:48:31,663
Come up
and cool off.

465
00:48:39,113 --> 00:48:42,412
Where'd I put
my tobacco?

466
00:48:47,121 --> 00:48:51,387
Now I know why
they sent a woman.

467
00:48:52,526 --> 00:48:55,654
Yep. You know what
you're gettin' into?

468
00:49:01,735 --> 00:49:04,727
You've landed smack-dab
right in the middle...

469
00:49:04,805 --> 00:49:09,765
of the lowest-down skunk of a scheme
they ever smeared across the West.

470
00:49:09,843 --> 00:49:12,243
Landed
feet first too.

471
00:49:12,312 --> 00:49:15,213
I reckon that's how you're
gonna get carried out of it.

472
00:49:15,282 --> 00:49:18,479
Just skip
the big talk.

473
00:49:18,552 --> 00:49:21,578
All right, gal.
Sit down.

474
00:49:26,693 --> 00:49:29,594
Somebody's runnin' guns
into the Indians.

475
00:49:29,663 --> 00:49:33,429
Enough rifles to massacre every
white man in the whole territory.

476
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,264
I can't understand why
they ain't attacked already.

477
00:49:36,336 --> 00:49:40,466
Maybe they're waitin'
for this.

478
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:42,532
Where'd you get
that dynamite?

479
00:49:42,609 --> 00:49:45,339
Two loads came in
on the wagon train.

480
00:49:45,412 --> 00:49:48,575
Someone's gonna pick it up,
and we got to find out who.

481
00:49:48,649 --> 00:49:51,140
What's your plan?

482
00:49:51,218 --> 00:49:55,018
Whoever killed Jim Hunter found out
there was a federal agent after him.

483
00:49:55,088 --> 00:49:57,648
They didn't know
who it was.

484
00:49:57,724 --> 00:50:00,454
I steered 'em
onto the wrong party.

485
00:50:00,527 --> 00:50:03,792
A husband I picked up in Fort
Deerfield, name of Painless Potter.

486
00:50:03,864 --> 00:50:05,957
They'll kill him, sure.

487
00:50:06,033 --> 00:50:08,024
That's right.

488
00:50:08,101 --> 00:50:12,800
They'll think the federal
agent's dead. Then I can operate.

489
00:50:15,776 --> 00:50:18,210
Hi.
Hi.

490
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:28,147
Where's the high life
around here?

491
00:50:28,222 --> 00:50:32,124
Right over in the Dirty
Shame Saloon. Spread out.

492
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,133
Isn't he a dandy?

493
00:50:43,203 --> 00:50:45,398
He's a humdinger.

494
00:50:45,472 --> 00:50:48,373
Here he comes,
folks!

495
00:50:58,185 --> 00:51:00,346
Welcome!
Welcome!

496
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:03,150
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen!

497
00:51:03,223 --> 00:51:05,885
We have a celebrity
in our midst.

498
00:51:05,959 --> 00:51:10,726
It's a rare privilege to shake the hand of the
greatest Indian fighter west of the Mississippi.

499
00:51:10,797 --> 00:51:13,288
You can include
the east, too, son.

500
00:51:13,367 --> 00:51:16,894
Watch it. Watch it. My trigger finger.

501
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:19,996
I'd consider it an honor
if you would join me.

502
00:51:20,073 --> 00:51:22,405
Heard you, partner.
Heard you.

503
00:51:27,547 --> 00:51:29,879
You were sayin'?

504
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:32,214
What'll you have,
my friend?

505
00:51:44,531 --> 00:51:46,556
Never mind
the chaser.

506
00:51:46,633 --> 00:51:49,898
Gonna be in town long?
How 'bout a dance?

507
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:52,768
Now, wait a minute. Wait a
minute. Don't fight over me, gals.

508
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:55,467
I'll be around a while.
Good.

509
00:51:55,542 --> 00:51:59,410
Take it slow. This could become habit for
me. Move in, honey. Don't get shut out.

510
00:51:59,479 --> 00:52:01,811
- Tell us how you did it.
Yes, sir. Stand by.

511
00:52:01,882 --> 00:52:04,578
I may raffle myself
off later.

512
00:52:08,322 --> 00:52:11,257
# This town
ain't big enough #

513
00:52:11,325 --> 00:52:17,992
# The streets ain't long enough
for me to get away from you #

514
00:52:18,065 --> 00:52:23,025
# Meet ya 'round the corner
'bout half-past eight #

515
00:52:23,103 --> 00:52:26,903
# Oh, honey
what we'll do #

516
00:52:26,973 --> 00:52:29,168
# The West ain't rough enough #

517
00:52:29,242 --> 00:52:31,574
# The joints
ain't tough enough #

518
00:52:31,645 --> 00:52:35,945
# To keep me
from the one I crave #

519
00:52:36,016 --> 00:52:40,953
# Meet ya 'round the corner
now don't be late #

520
00:52:41,021 --> 00:52:43,819
# You'll see how
I behave #

521
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:48,691
# When we're alone, honey #

522
00:52:48,762 --> 00:52:53,199
# You'll be possessin'
my best caressin' #

523
00:52:53,266 --> 00:52:57,532
# I'll be your own honey #

524
00:52:57,604 --> 00:53:02,268
# You're the kind
to make me lose my mind #

525
00:53:02,342 --> 00:53:07,143
# One kiss ain't strong enough
a kiss ain't long enough #

526
00:53:07,214 --> 00:53:11,310
# Gotta kiss you
night and day #

527
00:53:11,385 --> 00:53:15,822
# Meet ya 'round the corner
any old corner #

528
00:53:15,889 --> 00:53:20,553
# Meet ya anytime
you say ho-ho-ho #

529
00:53:20,627 --> 00:53:24,563
# Seein' as you're new here
soon as I'm through here #

530
00:53:24,631 --> 00:53:29,295
# I'll kiss ya in my
own sweet way ho-ho-ho #

531
00:53:29,369 --> 00:53:34,238
# Meet ya 'round the corner
any old corner #

532
00:53:34,307 --> 00:53:39,335
# Meet ya anytime
you say #

533
00:53:39,413 --> 00:53:41,381
You got a cigar
on ya, sister?

534
00:53:41,448 --> 00:53:44,440
Come on, handsome, let's
dance. Take me away.

535
00:54:23,056 --> 00:54:25,547
Look.
It’s Joe!

536
00:54:25,625 --> 00:54:27,650
It’s Joe!

537
00:54:30,597 --> 00:54:35,000
Don't do it, Joe.
This guy is a killer.

538
00:54:35,068 --> 00:54:38,731
What's the trouble, stranger? I don't
like nobody foolin' around my gal.

539
00:54:38,805 --> 00:54:41,205
Yeah, well,
I got news for ya.

540
00:54:41,274 --> 00:54:43,674
I ain't foolin'.
Now, get.

541
00:54:43,743 --> 00:54:46,507
You ain't scarin' nobody.

542
00:54:55,322 --> 00:55:00,259
This town ain't big enough for you and
me! I'll give you 'til sundown to get out.

543
00:55:00,327 --> 00:55:03,387
That's the usual time,
ain't it?

544
00:55:03,463 --> 00:55:07,126
At sundown, I'll be out
lookin' for you! I'll be waitin'!

545
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,294
And I'll be lookin'.

546
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:13,464
He plumb riled me.

547
00:55:19,713 --> 00:55:22,580
Four fingers
of red eye.

548
00:55:22,649 --> 00:55:25,846
I always feel like a drink
before a killin'.

549
00:55:27,921 --> 00:55:30,116
The thumb too.

550
00:55:39,299 --> 00:55:42,132
Nothin' stronger,
huh?

551
00:56:25,345 --> 00:56:27,870
The sun's almost down,
honey.

552
00:56:27,948 --> 00:56:29,711
Yeah.

553
00:56:29,783 --> 00:56:32,752
This little doll is just
itchin' for another notch.

554
00:56:32,819 --> 00:56:35,219
Here, wear this
for good luck.

555
00:56:35,288 --> 00:56:40,191
Yeah, but men don't wear these-
oh, yeah, sure, kid. Thanks.

556
00:56:42,896 --> 00:56:46,297
Hey, listen. The man that's
after you just killed my brother.

557
00:56:46,366 --> 00:56:50,803
Here's a tip. He draws from
the left, so lean to the right.

558
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:54,033
He draws from the left,
so lean to the right.

559
00:56:58,278 --> 00:57:01,770
Son, I'll let you in
on somethin'.

560
00:57:01,848 --> 00:57:05,249
Long towards sunset,
there's a wind from the east,

561
00:57:05,318 --> 00:57:07,843
so you better aim
to the west.

562
00:57:07,921 --> 00:57:12,449
Draws from the left, so lean to the right.
A wind from the east, so aim to the west.

563
00:57:16,129 --> 00:57:21,658
I know this Joe like a book. He crouches
when he shoots, so stand on your toes.

564
00:57:21,735 --> 00:57:25,330
Draws from the left, so lean to the right.
A wind from the east, aim to the west.

565
00:57:25,405 --> 00:57:29,808
He crouches when he shoots,
so stand on your toes. Thanks.

566
00:57:56,002 --> 00:57:59,369
Hey, Mrs. Potter, your
husband's mixed up in a gunfight!

567
00:58:00,807 --> 00:58:03,343
Well, that problem's
taken care of.

568
00:58:05,478 --> 00:58:08,970
He draws from the left,
so stand on your toes.

569
00:58:09,048 --> 00:58:12,040
There's a wind from the east,
better lean to the right.

570
00:58:13,353 --> 00:58:16,345
He crouches when he shoots,
better aim to the west.

571
00:58:16,422 --> 00:58:20,324
He draws from his toes, so lean
towards the wind. Aha! I got it!

572
00:58:23,596 --> 00:58:25,530
Why ya-

573
00:58:25,598 --> 00:58:27,566
Watch it.
Watch it.

574
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:37,104
Better warm up
a little.

575
00:58:46,686 --> 00:58:48,813
Wind shifted.

576
00:59:06,906 --> 00:59:09,306
Either way,
he wins.

577
01:00:06,399 --> 01:00:10,267
He draws from the wind,
so lean when you stand.

578
01:00:10,336 --> 01:00:12,600
No.

579
01:00:12,672 --> 01:00:16,164
He stands on his crouch
with his toes in the wind.

580
01:00:16,242 --> 01:00:18,233
No.

581
01:00:41,467 --> 01:00:43,526
Pfft!

582
01:00:45,171 --> 01:00:47,332
Shh.

583
01:01:57,843 --> 01:02:01,006
All right, Potter.

584
01:02:05,051 --> 01:02:08,487
Hooray for Painless Potter!

585
01:02:08,554 --> 01:02:12,285
How do ya like that? Tried to fool
me. Didn't crouch with the wind.

586
01:02:12,358 --> 01:02:14,519
What's
the idea?

587
01:02:14,594 --> 01:02:18,462
I nearly made a mistake.

588
01:02:18,531 --> 01:02:22,831
There's an old saying: "When you're
huntin' a mountain lion, stake out a goat. "

589
01:02:22,902 --> 01:02:26,770
Yeah, the lion gets the goat and
- we get the lion.

590
01:02:26,839 --> 01:02:31,708
We had better get rid of the
dynamite. Get a hold of Yellow Feather.

591
01:02:31,777 --> 01:02:34,610
Now you try and find out where
they're hidin' that dynamite.

592
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,012
And I'll round up
our goat.

593
01:02:37,083 --> 01:02:41,213
I'd have got him sooner but
I tripped. There's work for ya.

594
01:02:41,287 --> 01:02:44,051
Stick around,
I'll make you wealthy.

595
01:02:44,123 --> 01:02:47,957
Hurry, boys, I may have
to pose for a statue.

596
01:02:48,027 --> 01:02:52,088
Fooled ya that time,
didn't I?

597
01:02:52,164 --> 01:02:54,724
I have to be a hero.

598
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:59,828
Oh, you great big, wonderful man. I told
you my garter would bring you good luck.

599
01:02:59,905 --> 01:03:02,135
Oh, thanks. Lucky thing I had a gun too.

600
01:03:02,208 --> 01:03:04,733
How 'bout a great big
smack for Pepper? Well- -

601
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:06,835
Sounds like
a good idea.

602
01:03:19,992 --> 01:03:22,256
I don't want anybody
foolin' with my man!

603
01:03:26,399 --> 01:03:28,629
I've come back
to you, darlin'.

604
01:03:28,701 --> 01:03:30,965
What's that,
stranger?

605
01:03:31,037 --> 01:03:36,270
I didn't realize how much I loved you
until I saw how brave you were. Forgive me.

606
01:03:36,342 --> 01:03:40,608
Well, you didn't come crawlin' back on
your hands and knees, but I'll weaken.

607
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:43,012
You may kiss my cheek.

608
01:03:45,184 --> 01:03:48,347
Should we go to our room,
dear? That seems fair.

609
01:03:48,421 --> 01:03:52,414
My arm, Mrs. Potter.
Nah, over here.

610
01:03:54,293 --> 01:03:56,454
That's my shootin' side.

611
01:04:03,502 --> 01:04:05,902
Be right with you,
honey.

612
01:04:08,907 --> 01:04:12,001
There, that ought to
take care of the tourists.

613
01:04:26,391 --> 01:04:29,758
Gee, I never thought I'd find
a girl who would fight over me.

614
01:04:29,828 --> 01:04:33,889
Boy, when you hit her with that right, I
- Remember, I'm on your side.

615
01:04:33,965 --> 01:04:37,662
Why, of course, dear. I'm your
wife. Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.

616
01:04:37,736 --> 01:04:39,670
Yeah. Come.

617
01:04:40,972 --> 01:04:43,440
Come close to me,
wifey.

618
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:51,948
Oh, that was delightful!
Let's try another one, huh?

619
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:59,413
You poor kid. I'm
sorry I had to do that.

620
01:05:00,726 --> 01:05:04,287
What's the matter with me?
I must be gettin' soft.

621
01:05:10,836 --> 01:05:13,771
Hank!
Guns.

622
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:15,807
Dynamite.

623
01:05:15,874 --> 01:05:20,971
Undertaker's parlor.
You'll find the men that- -

624
01:05:21,046 --> 01:05:23,173
Hank.

625
01:05:32,257 --> 01:05:34,817
Painless!
Painless.

626
01:05:34,893 --> 01:05:39,830
Wake up. Wake up. He crouches
when he shoots, so aim to the- -

627
01:05:39,898 --> 01:05:43,129
Jane. Painless, do you love me?

628
01:05:43,201 --> 01:05:45,669
Oh, I'm
- I'm yours, body and soul.

629
01:05:45,737 --> 01:05:49,571
Will you do anything for me without
asking questions? Naturally, darling.

630
01:05:49,641 --> 01:05:53,600
Well, then listen carefully. There's
dynamite hidden in the undertaker's parlor.

631
01:05:53,678 --> 01:05:57,375
Someone's gonna come callin' for it tonight
and I want you to find out who they are.

632
01:05:57,449 --> 01:05:59,815
Are you tryin' to get
rid of me again?

633
01:05:59,885 --> 01:06:02,877
I can't tell you why now, but
this is important. You must go.

634
01:06:02,954 --> 01:06:06,253
I don't "must" anything. Any girl
would be tickled to be alone...

635
01:06:06,324 --> 01:06:09,623
with a guy who's killed 14
Indians for her, but not you!

636
01:06:09,694 --> 01:06:13,425
Every time we're alone, you try to give
me the heave-ho. Twenty years of my life.

637
01:06:13,498 --> 01:06:16,592
Our whole life together
depends on this. Will you go?

638
01:06:16,668 --> 01:06:19,967
What if I don't? What
then? I couldn't blame you.

639
01:06:20,038 --> 01:06:25,169
But all I can say is that I'm depending on
you more than I depended on anyone else before.

640
01:06:25,243 --> 01:06:28,906
Please. All right. I'll go.

641
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:32,245
But it's the last time you'll
make a monkey out of me.

642
01:06:32,317 --> 01:06:35,582
And you know that statue you told
me about? Tell them to carve on it...

643
01:06:35,654 --> 01:06:38,452
"Painless Potter:
Schmo. "

644
01:06:38,523 --> 01:06:43,119
I'll be seeing you. You too. Hey, look.
What's that? Some other guy you kissed?

645
01:06:43,195 --> 01:06:47,029
I'll explain later. There's no time
for questions. Please, trust me.

646
01:06:47,098 --> 01:06:50,158
I don't understand this
whole situation- - Please.

647
01:06:50,235 --> 01:06:54,831
All right, I'm goin'. Don't get
the idea that I'm scared or nervous.

648
01:06:56,675 --> 01:06:59,735
Because I'm not.
Who- -

649
01:07:33,645 --> 01:07:37,809
Shh. Shh. Get out of here...
before I sic a mouse on you.

650
01:07:43,255 --> 01:07:45,246
Shh.

651
01:07:59,004 --> 01:08:00,972
Shh.

652
01:09:10,241 --> 01:09:13,210
Hey, they got dynamite-

653
01:09:16,081 --> 01:09:19,016
Joe.
Fool.

654
01:09:55,553 --> 01:09:59,353
Come on, we gotta get this stuff out of
here fast. We're usin' the dentist's wagon...

655
01:09:59,424 --> 01:10:01,915
in case
there's a slipup.

656
01:10:27,419 --> 01:10:29,887
Come on,
hurry it up.

657
01:10:41,166 --> 01:10:43,634
Take it easy.

658
01:10:47,839 --> 01:10:50,933
Reach, you varmints, or
I'll tattoo you the hard way!

659
01:10:51,009 --> 01:10:55,537
Uh-huh. I know all about you and your
dynamite. You were gonna give it to the Indians.

660
01:10:55,613 --> 01:11:00,448
Well, I'm gonna take you down to the sheriff's
office and have a talk about your future.

661
01:11:00,518 --> 01:11:03,544
If any.
Now, get goin'!

662
01:11:03,621 --> 01:11:06,351
Painless Potter
rides again! I- -

663
01:12:12,189 --> 01:12:16,023
And then I found out
that you were captured too.

664
01:12:16,093 --> 01:12:21,531
I'd been meaning to tell you anyway. Hearing
those drums, I figured this was my last chance.

665
01:12:21,598 --> 01:12:23,998
Then it wasn't me
that shot all those Indians?

666
01:12:26,136 --> 01:12:29,697
And I didn't even
shoot Joe?

667
01:12:29,773 --> 01:12:32,901
And any minute
I could have been killed?

668
01:12:35,078 --> 01:12:37,012
Now, I worry.

669
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:42,848
Sayin' I'm sorry is like spittin'
in your eye, and I'm sayin' it.

670
01:12:44,087 --> 01:12:46,021
Me, a hero?

671
01:12:46,089 --> 01:12:49,547
Boy, I couldn't save a clam
from a bowl of chowder.

672
01:12:49,626 --> 01:12:54,188
I bet I handed you a lot of laughs.
What a sucker I've been. What a boob.

673
01:12:54,264 --> 01:12:57,927
There ain't low enough words
for what I've done to you.

674
01:12:58,001 --> 01:13:01,402
There are now. I just thought
of a couple of new ones.

675
01:13:01,471 --> 01:13:05,532
And all the time, I thought you were about
the finest thing that ever came into my life.

676
01:13:05,609 --> 01:13:08,737
That's what sticks
in my craw.

677
01:13:08,812 --> 01:13:12,043
Painless.
What now?

678
01:13:12,115 --> 01:13:15,107
There's one more thing
I gotta tell you.

679
01:13:15,185 --> 01:13:19,053
I gotta tell you that I love
you. What's this, another laugh?

680
01:13:19,122 --> 01:13:24,219
No. I think you’re the kindest,
bravest man I've ever known.

681
01:13:24,294 --> 01:13:26,319
Oh, sure.

682
01:13:26,396 --> 01:13:31,459
And I want to tell you this now because...
we may not get out of this alive.

683
01:13:31,535 --> 01:13:35,232
Yeah, well, if it
hadn't been for you-

684
01:13:38,008 --> 01:13:40,636
Well, what do you know.

685
01:13:50,087 --> 01:13:52,885
What's the matter?

686
01:13:52,956 --> 01:13:55,754
No stars.

687
01:13:55,826 --> 01:13:57,521
Hoo!

688
01:14:14,010 --> 01:14:16,137
Maybe he's-

689
01:14:16,213 --> 01:14:19,046
Hey!

690
01:14:19,116 --> 01:14:23,052
What's the matter? You trying to
dirty my scalp even before you get it?

691
01:14:34,464 --> 01:14:37,433
How.
Not so good.

692
01:14:37,501 --> 01:14:40,766
Me Yellow Feather.
Me chief of tribe.

693
01:14:40,837 --> 01:14:43,397
Me greet
paleface warrior.

694
01:14:43,473 --> 01:14:48,706
Oh! Well, I think you got
the wrong person. She's the-

695
01:14:48,778 --> 01:14:51,338
Yeah. Me very big
paleface warrior.

696
01:14:51,414 --> 01:14:53,473
You strong here.

697
01:14:53,550 --> 01:14:55,984
Yeah, heap big heap.

698
01:14:56,052 --> 01:15:00,716
Paleface more brave
than all white warriors.

699
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:03,054
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

700
01:15:03,126 --> 01:15:07,153
Yellow Feather know
you kill 11 his best braves.

701
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:09,698
Fifteen! Painless, tell him the truth.

702
01:15:09,766 --> 01:15:11,700
Eleven.
That's not what I mean.

703
01:15:11,768 --> 01:15:14,669
Yellow Feather, he didn't have
anything to do with this. I got him-

704
01:15:14,738 --> 01:15:17,605
Ho gon se!
Let her breathe.

705
01:15:17,674 --> 01:15:21,542
Paleface warrior
get much praise.

706
01:15:21,611 --> 01:15:23,977
My tribe
make big honor.

707
01:15:24,047 --> 01:15:27,312
Fine!
Ga on wah sa ah.

708
01:15:27,384 --> 01:15:30,751
Yellow Feather, please! No,
not that! Not to him! Huh?

709
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:34,051
How!
Yeah, I'll let you know.

710
01:15:38,061 --> 01:15:42,725
I don't know what he said, but it didn't
sound like he was inviting me to a picnic.

711
01:15:42,799 --> 01:15:46,166
What did he say? I'd
rather not talk about it.

712
01:15:46,236 --> 01:15:49,728
Yeah, but I don't like surprises.
Am I gonna get shot by arrows?

713
01:15:49,806 --> 01:15:53,537
Burned at the stake? Boiled
in a pot? Am I getting warm?

714
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:01,647
Painless, can you take
it? No, but tell me anyway.

715
01:16:01,718 --> 01:16:06,815
Well, with Indians, the bigger hero
you are, the greater the torture.

716
01:16:06,890 --> 01:16:10,382
Yeah, but... what can
they do? What's left?

717
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:12,428
Well- -

718
01:16:14,764 --> 01:16:16,994
Two trees.

719
01:16:17,067 --> 01:16:21,902
They bend one tree down. Then
they bend the other tree down.

720
01:16:21,972 --> 01:16:25,271
And they tie one of your
legs to this tree. Mine?

721
01:16:25,342 --> 01:16:28,937
And they tie your
other leg to this tree.

722
01:16:29,012 --> 01:16:31,173
Then,
they cut the ropes.

723
01:16:33,316 --> 01:16:35,648
That's me?

724
01:16:37,087 --> 01:16:39,578
If I were a chicken bone,
I could make a wish.

725
01:16:44,894 --> 01:16:48,660
At a time like this,
he has to be off-key.

726
01:16:48,732 --> 01:16:52,190
Don't pull,
you'll get your half.

727
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:07,041
Soh goth to naugh hon
yah! That's your story.

728
01:17:14,024 --> 01:17:17,050
I think it's time I told you,
I'm not this brave.

729
01:17:17,127 --> 01:17:20,153
Just think, I'll be traveling
east and west at the same time.

730
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:22,721
Painless!

731
01:17:22,799 --> 01:17:25,666
Painless.
Oh, don't worry, honey.

732
01:17:25,735 --> 01:17:30,502
Maybe in the next world you'll meet two
nice fellas. Look close, they'll both be me.

733
01:17:33,677 --> 01:17:35,770
Let's be fair.

734
01:17:35,845 --> 01:17:40,372
Gee nah!

735
01:17:51,027 --> 01:17:54,485

01:17:58,268 --> 01:18:00,930
Wapato medicine bad.

738
01:18:01,004 --> 01:18:04,201
Shame us
with white squaw.

739
01:18:04,274 --> 01:18:07,471
Go. You will not come back.

740
01:18:07,544 --> 01:18:11,173
Ne wah!
Ne wah!

741
01:18:22,792 --> 01:18:26,728
Help! Help!
Help! Help!

742
01:18:26,796 --> 01:18:30,323
Help. Help.
Help. Help.

743
01:18:47,817 --> 01:18:50,047
I better get goin'.

744
01:18:51,688 --> 01:18:55,852
Jane! She's still there. And
it's up to me to save her.

745
01:18:55,925 --> 01:19:00,328
Hold it, impulsive. If those Indians
grab you, you know what'll happen to you.

746
01:19:00,397 --> 01:19:04,128
We don't like that, do we?
What are you, a man or mouse?

747
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:08,398
I'm not a mouse and I'm not a man. I'm
a dentist. Yeah, but the girl loves you.

748
01:19:08,471 --> 01:19:11,531
Yeah. Yeah,
and I love her too.

749
01:19:11,608 --> 01:19:14,076
But if they get me, my life
won't be worth a plug nickel.

750
01:19:14,144 --> 01:19:16,578
What'll your life
be worth without her?

751
01:19:16,646 --> 01:19:20,844
Oh, now don't get sentimental with
me. Let's look at it logically.

752
01:19:20,917 --> 01:19:25,286
If I go back, those Indians will part my
hair down to my toes. How can that help Jane?

753
01:19:25,355 --> 01:19:28,119
Suit yourself. If you think you
can spend those long evenings...

754
01:19:28,191 --> 01:19:31,683
just thinkin' about how you might have
saved her, it's all right with me.

755
01:19:31,761 --> 01:19:35,697
Oh, stop, stop. I'll go. But don't forget,
I'll always hate you for being stubborn.

756
01:19:35,765 --> 01:19:38,290
Besides, I have to pick up
my other boot.

757
01:20:12,302 --> 01:20:15,829
How! How.

758
01:20:15,905 --> 01:20:20,205
You like to trade? Clothes?
Me take those, huh? Like that?

759
01:20:20,276 --> 01:20:23,575
Why, you!

760
01:20:36,659 --> 01:20:39,822
I got him! I got
him! Ya-hoo-hoo!

761
01:20:53,643 --> 01:20:55,736
How. How. How.

762
01:20:55,812 --> 01:20:58,576
Well, Chief, this completes
our part of the bargain.

763
01:20:58,648 --> 01:21:01,242
You bring long rifles,
dynamite?

764
01:21:01,317 --> 01:21:05,515
An ample supply. All
is in order. Esta exsa.

765
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:10,726
You low-down, stinkin', coyote!
You're the one I've been lookin' for.

766
01:21:10,793 --> 01:21:13,591
Hold her!
Well- -

767
01:21:13,663 --> 01:21:17,292
That's your federal agent.
What are you gonna do with her?

768
01:21:17,367 --> 01:21:21,064
Burn. Take more than a
governor's pardon to save you now.

769
01:21:21,137 --> 01:21:24,231
Esta exsa!

770
01:21:30,713 --> 01:21:34,080
Come. We talk.

771
01:22:14,925 --> 01:22:18,691
Hubby-hubby.
Hubby-hubby.

772
01:22:18,762 --> 01:22:21,890
# East is east
please don't cry #

773
01:22:21,965 --> 01:22:25,230
# This is your hubby
Painless #

774
01:22:25,302 --> 01:22:28,396
Hubby-hubby.
Hubby-hubby.

775
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:31,935
Medicine man
come back!

776
01:22:32,009 --> 01:22:35,240
Burn him. Burn him
with white squaw.

777
01:22:35,312 --> 01:22:37,712
Ojesa!

778
01:22:40,284 --> 01:22:42,844
Wapato! Wapato!

779
01:22:42,919 --> 01:22:46,116
Wapato! Wapato!
Wapato!

780
01:22:46,189 --> 01:22:50,558
Wapato.
Ojesta!

781
01:22:50,627 --> 01:22:53,323
Ojesta! Ojesta!

782
01:23:05,942 --> 01:23:10,311
Hey!
Ojesta!

783
01:23:12,816 --> 01:23:16,445
You don't know what you're
doing. Don't worry, I'll save ya.

784
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,954
Who they gonna burn over
there? The medicine man.

785
01:23:19,022 --> 01:23:22,788
Serves him right for practicing
without a license. Ya-hoo!

786
01:23:22,859 --> 01:23:27,592
I got 'em fooled, all right. They think you’re
the medicine man they're gonna burn.

787
01:23:27,664 --> 01:23:30,565
Ya!
Ye- ye-

788
01:23:30,634 --> 01:23:33,125
Me?

789
01:23:46,817 --> 01:23:50,082
Don't move.
I'll try to lead 'em away.

790
01:23:51,188 --> 01:23:54,157
Something might work out.

791
01:24:10,273 --> 01:24:13,877
Ojesta!
Ojesta!

792
01:24:14,010 --> 01:24:16,740
Ojesta! Ojesta!

793
01:24:22,886 --> 01:24:25,377
What's the matter
with you?

794
01:24:29,826 --> 01:24:33,193
Why, you crazy Indian!

795
01:25:06,062 --> 01:25:08,997
Sorry, ma'am.

796
01:25:12,502 --> 01:25:14,436
How.

797
01:25:38,161 --> 01:25:41,153
Didn't I tell you
I'd save you.

798
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:54,836
Boy, it smells like somebody's
been cooking cauliflower in here.

799
01:25:54,911 --> 01:25:58,347
Come on, get out of
here. I'll see ya around.

800
01:25:58,414 --> 01:26:00,678
Jago mick we!

801
01:26:02,452 --> 01:26:05,114
Hey, fellas,
wait for me!

802
01:26:29,746 --> 01:26:31,976
Wa-hoo!

803
01:26:32,048 --> 01:26:34,516
Grab a rifle
and start shootin'!

804
01:26:34,584 --> 01:26:36,575
Yeah.

805
01:26:40,590 --> 01:26:42,785
Give me
one of those guns!

806
01:26:42,859 --> 01:26:46,556
Yes, ma'am. Here, take any size
you want, honey. Why, we'll get-

807
01:26:46,629 --> 01:26:49,894
Get back! It's not safe! Yes, ma'am.

808
01:26:52,101 --> 01:26:54,797
They're walkin'
right into our trap.

809
01:27:02,245 --> 01:27:04,839
A billiard!

810
01:27:09,152 --> 01:27:12,815
Pretty tricky,
those foreigners.

811
01:27:20,897 --> 01:27:22,888
Where's my rifle?

812
01:27:37,780 --> 01:27:41,375
They wanted dynamite, huh?
Well, I'll give it to 'em.

813
01:27:52,261 --> 01:27:55,287
Must've been a dud.

814
01:28:42,945 --> 01:28:46,676
Hey, faster!
They're gaining on us!

815
01:28:46,749 --> 01:28:50,776
Hey, get up in front!
You're supposed to be pullin'!

816
01:28:50,853 --> 01:28:52,821
Hey!

817
01:28:52,889 --> 01:28:54,857
Jump, Painless!

818
01:28:54,924 --> 01:28:58,257
If I jump, I'll get
killed! But the dynamite!

819
01:28:59,662 --> 01:29:02,654
Rigor mortis,
here I come!

820
01:29:09,839 --> 01:29:12,899
Get Martin
off that wagon!

821
01:29:20,383 --> 01:29:22,476
That's the last
of 'em.

822
01:29:27,623 --> 01:29:30,490
Darn it! There goes my dental diploma.

823
01:29:34,030 --> 01:29:37,056
Here they come now!

824
01:29:38,668 --> 01:29:42,604
Don't get excited. I'll be back
in a year or so. Don't worry.

825
01:29:42,672 --> 01:29:46,506
Our hero! Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Potter.

826
01:29:46,576 --> 01:29:50,205
Silly girl. You gotta
expect this kind of thing.

827
01:29:55,551 --> 01:29:59,544
Let's not overdo it. I know I
deserve it, but... steady, men.

828
01:29:59,622 --> 01:30:02,523
Take it out
of the bags, fellas.

829
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:07,727
Honey, I'll drive. Yeah,
you drive and I'll watch.

830
01:30:07,797 --> 01:30:10,732
Finally going on your
honeymoon? Am I! Ya-hoo!

831
01:30:15,871 --> 01:30:17,896
What do you want,
a happy ending?
