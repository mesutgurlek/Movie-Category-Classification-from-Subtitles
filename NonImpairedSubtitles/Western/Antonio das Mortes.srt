1
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,951
When was Brazil discovered ?


2
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,195
In 1500.

3
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,833
Again.

4
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,757
Independance, which year ?

5
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,280
1822.

6
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,750
Freedom for slaves ?

7
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,596
In 1888.

8
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,637
The Republic ? Which year ?

9
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,037
1889.

10
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,908
The year of the death of Lampiao ?

11
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,478
1938.

12
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,719
"I came here,
- I have no family, nor a name -"

13
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,100
"pulled by the wind,"

14
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,668
"for a last fight against hunger."

15
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,035
"I carry with me the people
of this brazilian sertao."


16
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,310
"I've put back on my head
a cangaceiro hat."

17
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,437
"I want to see the men
of this town appear."

18
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,791
"The pride and the wealthy
of the dragon of spite."

19
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,869
"Today I'm going away,
but someday, I'll be back."

20
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,550
"And, to this pitiless day,
not a stone will survive."

21
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,395
"Because vengeance has two faces :"

22
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,273
"the one of Love,
and the one of Hate."


23
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,790
"Say three Our Father's.
Lampiao, Our Lord !"

24
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,393
Dr Mattos,

25
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,199
I remember
as if it was yesterday.

26
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,999
On a road, I met Lampiao.

27
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,839
He stopped by, and from his eyes
pure tears flowed.

28
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,916
And he added : "Antonio..."

29
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,955
"Don't you want to join the cangaçao ?"

30
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,752
Doctor...

31
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,399
I wanted to, but...
my pride made me refuse.

32
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,835
The good-looking and blond 
Corisco then appeared.

33
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,156
He said to him :

34
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,669
"Let me bleed this ape."

35
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,755
But Lampiao answered him :

36
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,397
"Not him, he's a man of honor."

37
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,830
"He's an enemy, but he's loyal."

38
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,313
Dr Mattos,
Lampiao was my mirror.

39
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,431
The next morning,
I was already hunting him.

40
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,838
One day, in the middle of a road

41
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,833
and in the middle of a gunfight,
Lampiao would yell at me :

42
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,474
"Antonio, Is it you Antonio ?"

43
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,758
When Corisco did recognize me,
he became mad.

44
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,713
He jumped and shot...

45
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,039
and the wind shook his hair...


46
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,993
which floated like gold flags.

47
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,630
Then, I killed him

48
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,231
and everything was over.

49
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,991
And now you tell me,

50
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,193
that there's still cangaceiros...

51
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,711
I can't believe you.

52
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,074
I agree to do what you ask me to.

53
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,430
But I don't want money.

54
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,989
I'll go to the Garden of the Piranhas,
to see if it's true...

55
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,794
that they still exist.

56
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,154
Madalena,

57
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,109
ready my old trunk,

58
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,152
put in my rifle and my hat.

59
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,916
I'm traveling.

60
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,312
Cursed by ten churches

61
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,790
Rejected by all saints

62
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,030
Antonio das Mortes

63
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,672
Killer of the Cangaceiros

64
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,519
Bring him on, Batista.

65
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,198
Bring him on!

66
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,158
It's him, Laura.

67
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,434
Coronel, here's Antonio das Mortes.

68
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,798
He came to watch over the cangaceiros...

69
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,032
I asked you for police reinforcements.

70
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,832
Antonio is better.

71
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,430
If he kills, there will be no investigation,

72
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,916
nor questioning,
nor press article.

73
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,110
And he doesn't want money.

74
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,030
Mattos, a free mercenary
brings bad luck.

75
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,555
Furthermore, it's useless.

76
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,718
Some say that this cangaceiro
is nothing but theater.

77
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,758
Maybe, coronel,

78
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,394
but a "nothing" could spoil the future
of the Garden of the Piranhas.

79
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,116
I want to install industry.

80
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,434
Investors from the south
will require order.

81
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,078
We must end the violence.

82
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,949
The agrarian reform will resolve the struggles.

83
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,232
What ? Agrarian reform ?

84
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,188
Yes, coronel,
Agrarian reform.

85
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,231
This is the progress,
sign of the times.

86
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,079
Me, to share my lands ?

87
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,512
Did you become crazy ?

88
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,074
To share my lands,
with these work-shies ?

89
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,350
Is the government mad ?

90
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,632
It is not its task to care about
the things of the land.


91
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,353
It's mine.

92
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,837
It has to care about machines.
The land, it's my business.

93
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,877
Don't talk to me about american help,

94
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,470
agrarian reform or industry 
and other lies.

95
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,113
I only know my cows.

96
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,432
Something else.
I don't fear no misfortune.

97
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,078
And I don't need Antonio das Mortes.

98
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,392
I only want Laura.

99
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,436
Laura, my love, come near me.

100
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,311
Agrarian reform... To share
my lands with these work-shies...

101
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,511
They'll have to fight too.

102
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,950
I don't share my sweat.

103
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,037
They'll have to kill me
to take over my lands.


104
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,955
The elder is becoming mad.

105
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,472
Go set your stuff down,
and wait for my orders.

106
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,675
Laura, you'll always be by my side.

107
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,754
To share my lands with these work-shies ?!

108
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,439
Batista,

109
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,230
If Dr Getulio Varg still lived,

110
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,314
nobody would dare to 
take over our lands.

111
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,275
The guilty about all of that...
Atomic bomb...

112
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,271
There's beautifull women in town.

113
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,549
You should meet them.

114
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,275
To do what ?
You already have one in the neighborhood.

115
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,189
It's not me who says that.

116
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,994
The people are talking, commissar.


117
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,714
Vox populi, vox dei.

118
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,753
Did you learn latin from the priest ?

119
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,236
By the way, the priest
wants me to become the prefect.

120
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,671
What a frightening challenger for me !

121
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,199
What's your political platform ?

122
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,753
The pulpit !

123
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,111
Will you become a sexton ?

124
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,949
I don't have any access to the bed,
or the dinner table of a coronel.

125
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,953
I'm going to be prefect, then deputy.

126
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,553
And then, senator.

127
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,638
I'll find you a good job, with
a regular salary.

128
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,957
Good. I wasn't paid for
the last six months.

129
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,479
No pessimism.

130
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,875
A great economic cycle begins.

131
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,594
I only know the cycle of cocoa.

132
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,031
The cycle of coffee, of gold,
the one of diamond...

133
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,756
The cycle of sugar, of petrol 
and of the rubber.

134
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,749
The dollar is the savior 
of this country.


135
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,817
Will it save the country,
or its receiver ?

136
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,798
I loved, I loved too much.

137
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,714
I suffered from love

138
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,399
like nobody else

139
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,270
I've cried, and I've lost peace

140
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,954
I know that nobody never ever...

141
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,799
The 'cachaça', you pay it !

142
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,793
My Saint...

143
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,879
The time has come. The time to burn 
the living ones and to destroy the town.

144
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,032
I have to fulfill my vow.

145
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,710
For the angels' happiness, and
the people's happiness.

146
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,998
Show respect to God, Captain Coirana.

147
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,954
Respect god and the government.

148
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,991
To respect ?

149
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,712
And who shows respect to us ?

150
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,552
Us, poor wandering unhappy ones ?

151
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,153
Only vengeance shall permit us to
forget the years of suffering.


152
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,072
Without respect.
Absolutly no respect.

153
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,308
It has been proved in the past,
and it will be proved in the future :

154
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,316
the one who fights against the government

155
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,272
shall pay with his own head.

156
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,635
The unhappy cries.

157
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,678
The destiny of poverty is hell.

158
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,630
I want to embark again on my whithe ship...

159
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,355
and sail back to Africa.

160
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,192
My Grandfather's Africa.

161
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,594
Negro Antao,
you are bathing in fear.

162
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,829
You are at the limits of ignorance.

163
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,480
Future lies beyond future.

164
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,035
Not before past.

165
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,834
I've traveled around the world

166
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,032
I've seen the misfortunes of other peoples.

167
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,636
I've learned this Truth from The Holy Book :

168
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,435
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."

169
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,040
In 1945,

170
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,355
When Brazil entered the war 
in the Far Europe,

171
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,159
it was the dictature of Vargas.

172
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,189
Did Brazil win this war ?

173
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,839
Didn't it ?

174
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,717
For myself, I've lost them all.

175
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,429
By fear and cowardise.

176
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,713
I've even lost the sight of my enemy.

177
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,312
Professor...

178
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,470
Do you see this hand ?

179
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,474
This hand killed many cangaceiros...

180
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,993
And now, I'm alone...
In the loneliness of memories.

181
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,470
I have to find another enemy.

182
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,234
To give a meaning to my life.

183
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,954
I want to see,

184
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,754
if Coirana really is a cangaceiro.

185
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,315
If he exists, professor,

186
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,278
I have to kill him.

187
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,710
My heart

188
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,353
What is the reason for

189
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,879
You to beat so quickly

190
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,519
When he sees you

191
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,393
And my eyes start to laugh

192
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,717
They hunt you, on the street

193
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,751
However

194
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,188
You run away

195
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,597
If only you'd know how sweet I am

196
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,950
And how much I want you

197
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,358
If you knew how much I'm sincere,
you would stay by my side

198
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,754
Come

199
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,955
Come feel the warm

200
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,788
Of my lips

201
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,479
They're seeking yours

202
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,911
Come to quench this passion

203
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,515
which is devouring my heart

204
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,075
Then only

205
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,679
I'll know happiness

206
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,836
The great happiness

207
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,520
"They are more than thousands in debt to me.

208
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,871
"But if I enumerate them all,
The earth will shake.

209
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,030
"I'm claiming for the debts in the
Lampiao's testament.

210
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,597
"A man has to become a woman,
A woman has to ask for mercy.

211
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,835
"Freedom for the prisoner,
prison for the jailer.

212
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,639
"A white veil for the whore
who will marry at the Church.

213
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,068
"Money for my poverty, and
something to eat for my people


214
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,914
"Honor my revendications,
or I'll come back."

215
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,315
Are you of flesh ? Are you of shadows ?

216
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,877
Anwer that, cursed cangaceiro !

217
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,709
I don't believe in your
ridiculous clothing.

218
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,629
"First, tell me your name,
then wear off your disguise."

219
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,477
"Who talk like this is
already condemned."

220
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,591
Open your ears.

221
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,031
I am Antonio das Mortes.

222
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,673
Here to frighten your cowardise,
and to override your destiny.

223
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,479
And I add,
not on brazilian territory,

224
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,877
nor in heaven, nor in hell :

225
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,191
there is no place for
a new cangaceiro !

226
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,716
Be ready, my people !
And look at the duel

227
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,593
between the dragon of cruelty
and the holy warrior.

228
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,191
From Corisco to Lampiao,
no more soul-in-sorrow in hell.

229
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,435
Be ready !

230
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,598
I'm going to end up with your race,
Antonio das Mortes.

231
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,996
Come, I'm waiting,
Antonio das Mortes !

232
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,236
The Piranhas took me !

233
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,794
The Piranhas are devouring me !

234
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,069
Mattos, put an end to these chants !

235
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,630
Put an end to these chants !

236
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,838
I am coronel Horacio,
I order you to stop singing !

237
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,318
Batista, make them stop !

238
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,069
Put an end to that devil chant !

239
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,319
They have to stop,
I'm ordering it !

240
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,034
Laura, put an end to these chants !

241
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,353
They have to stop,
It's an order !

242
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,150
Coronel Horacio is ordering

243
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,915
these chants to be ceased !

244
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,317
I'm like a father to you,

245
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,595
The Garden of the Piranhas is poor,

246
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,912
Look at me,
my clothes, my home...

247
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,709
The government is making fun of me,
by promising food,

248
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,956
money for the poors,

249
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,591
drugs, a doctor...
But nothing comes.

250
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,918
My hands are tied,

251
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,158
I can't nourish all of you. 
I'm not the Christ.

252
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,998
I'm a good man,

253
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,750
But I can't do miracles.

254
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,831
Did you hear me ?

255
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,998
Go away, all of you !

256
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,078
Wait, I'll do you charity.

257
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,399
Batista, open the store

258
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,750
and give them some flour and meat.

259
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,679
Remember, it's charity.

260
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,877
Mattos, that's a charitable act,

261
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,431
I'm going to nourish every one,

262
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,117
Batista, open the store
and nourish them,

263
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,193
Say to everyone,

264
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,676
that i'm a good and charitable man,

265
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,673
Flour and meat,

266
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,149
Antonio Conselheiro,

267
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,758
Saint Lourenço

268
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,159
called "Cauldron ",

269
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,719
Saint Sebastiao

270
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,674
called "the Good-looking",

271
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,879
Lampiao,

272
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,196
Antonio Silvino,
cangaceiro and poet,

273
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,914
All from Juazeiro.

274
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,353
Many became mad trying to
change this sertao.

275
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,108
You can't change the creation of God.

276
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,912
This cangaceiro...

277
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,953
Why didn't Antonio das Mortes
exterminate this race.

278
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,716
I'm more confident in Mata Vaca,

279
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,479
Professor...

280
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,955
Did you look at this woman, this saint ?

281
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,638
You already found a cangaceiro.

282
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,830
And now a saint ?

283
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,950
What do you want to do with a saint ?

284
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:25,400
She remembers me of a young girl
from Pernambouco.

285
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,674
She had slept with
the coronel's son,

286
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,311
and got pregnant.

287
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,589
Then, she sold herself to prostitution.

288
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,750
At the Sao Francisco bay.

289
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,071
She became tuberculous,

290
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,158
then throw herself in the river.

291
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,549
She was devoured by piranhas.

292
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,911
Not even a bone was left.


293
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,512
Requiescat in pace,

294
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,998
Antonio das Mortes.

295
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,109
Antonio das Mortes,
here, before me...

296
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,152
I saw you, black bird.

297
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,956
Falcon, vulture...

298
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,312
Corisco, I'll avenge you.

299
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,790
My brothers, I'll avenge you all.

300
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,233
Captain Lampiao, you were 
the governor of this sertao,

301
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,353
I'll avenge you !

302
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,479
Antonio.

303
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,589
We should bring him to the moutains.

304
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,837
If he dies here,

305
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,069
they'll come back.

306
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,629
I don't want another slaughter, nor blood.

307
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,511
Captain Lampiao, Corisco...

308
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,390
The Piranhas are devouring me.

309
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,394
But I'm gonna kill them.

310
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,394
Captain Lampiao, you'll be avenged.

311
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,432
I'll avenge Corisco...

312
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,469
I'll avenge all of you.

313
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,274
I'm gonna kill them.

314
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,116
Antonio das Mortes, I'm gonna kill you.

315
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,320
One day, an endless war will start.

316
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,589
Where did you hear that ?

317
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,632
From the mouth of God.

318
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,234
You, don't use the name of God.

319
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,357
My parents, my grandparents, 
they were all saints.

320
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,069
And they all died by your hands.

321
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,159
They did join the cangaço.

322
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,631
And died by your hands.

323
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:00,391
Today, this people will die
by your hands, too.

324
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,791
If Coirana dies,

325
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:09,280
the people will die 
of thirst and hunger.

326
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,677
My Saint,

327
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,392
I've seen many churches,

328
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,550
but not one patron saint.

329
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,350
I swear I've came here

330
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,954
only for the sake of finding

331
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,912
if a cangaceiro was still alive.


332
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,149
I was sure that Corisco was the last one.

333
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,155
But I don't want to kill anymore.

334
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,756
If I killed your parents,

335
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,591
your grandparents, your brothers...

336
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,510
May you forgive me, my Saint.

337
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,432
The one who murders will be thrown
in the deeps of the sea.

338
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,918
Go away, Antonio.

339
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,994
And on every roads of fire on the world

340
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,633
Ask for forgiveness for your crimes.

341
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,551
Look, Antonio das Mortes

342
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,956
Look at the marks of torture.

343
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,759
I leaved on a rotten truck.

344
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,396
Hoping to find wealth.

345
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:40,111
Here at the Minas Gerais,

346
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,556
I became a slave.

347
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,752
I was employed

348
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,789
In the forests of the Mato Grosso.

349
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,716
Only the strongs survived.

350
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,235
The weak ones were sold.

351
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,392
Then came the time of revolt and regrets.

352
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,677
I went back on the way to Bahia.

353
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,399
When I reached Juazeiro, I saw...

354
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,108
When I reached Juazeiro, I saw...

355
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,279
an old man,
who wanted to sell his daughter

356
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,789
for 5000 coins.

357
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:55,034
I took the girl,
and ran away to the sertao,

358
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,235
to the borders of Alagoas

359
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,034
when I reached,
I've seen them both, and I said :

360
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:18,998
Here are the angels of poverty.

361
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,519
I unearthed

362
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,992
my grandmother's clothes

363
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:30,035
And gave them to her.

364
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:37,829
Him, I've named him Coirana,

365
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,989
The venimous snake.

366
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,669
We leaved to wander on the roads,

367
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,438
Together and happy.

368
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,952
The one who murders will be thrown
in the deeps of the sea.

369
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,239
Go away, Antonio.

370
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,953
And on every road of fire on this world,

371
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,757
ask for forgiveness for your crimes.

372
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,632
The dragon of cruelty,
it's you, Antonio.

373
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,595
Everyone in the sertao knows

374
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,390
that under your cape,
you're wearing a gold shirt

375
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,958
which protects you from bullets.

376
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,668
The gold the wealthies gave you
to murder the poors.

377
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,430
Are you fine, Antonio ?

378
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,033
Father...

379
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,633
I have to talk to Dr Mattos.

380
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,916
For the love of God,

381
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,710
Tell him to come here.

382
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,835
You'll never be the equal of my husband

383
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,600
until you have the courage to kill him.

384
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,074
Horacio is more a man than you.

385
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,999
He turned everyone into slaves.

386
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,711
I'm myself in great debt to him.

387
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,636
Did I do wrong when I leaved 
the brothels of Bahia ?

388
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,991
When he dies, we will inherit everything.

389
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,551
You promised me to get me away from here.

390
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:58,035
I'll only be able to change 
my life when he's dead.

391
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,039
Laura, I'm not a murderer.

392
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,677
You're the commissar, and you 
already killed to follow his orders.

393
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,357
You're only a murderer,

394
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,151
a failed murderer.

395
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,716
When you talked about killing Horacio,
I thought you'll do it.

396
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,670
What's best now ?

397
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,190
To kill him, or not 
to have the courage to do it ?

398
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,399
I have something to ask you.

399
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,029
Ask the coronel

400
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,396
to open his store

401
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,079
and to give the rest of his food

402
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,391
to Coirana's people.

403
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,156
And, commissar,

404
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,599
ask him to let these people
settle here,

405
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,996
to let them work the lands.

406
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,918
I did not bring you here

407
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,714
to make such revendications !

408
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,269
Did you think about what I asked you ?

409
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,798
Since I've met these peoples,

410
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,193
I'm starting to feel something in my heart.

411
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,872
And heart has reasons that
we can't explain.

412
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,918
The food of the store is
only to be sold.

413
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,757
And the lands are owned by the
coronel.

414
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,071
God made the world.

415
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,589
The devil made the barbed wires.

416
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:58,830
If the coronel sinned, 
he must pay.

417
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,318
I only ask you one thing commissar.

418
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,630
Go to him, and tell him my revendications.

419
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,633
Let us make a deal :

420
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,270
find the way to kill the coronel,

421
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:23,398
and i'll do everything you want.

422
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,270
I'll give you more, a small house

423
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,238
to die in peace.

424
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,554
You're and educated man,

425
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,479
but my ignorance is revolting :

426
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,355
I'll only kill the coronel,

427
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,273
If he rejects my revendications.

428
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,678
- So, why don't you talk to him ?

429
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,312
- It's your hand,

430
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,797
It's your hand that did step in my destiny,

431
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,757
you have to go on,

432
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,628
If I've followed a corrupted man,

433
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,117
I'll purificate myself
at the root of corruption.

434
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,356
That's what is life,

435
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:24,435
God wrote the Truths
with tortuous lines.

436
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,748
You are an unresponsible, Mattos !

437
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,313
Shut up !

438
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,673
I have many experience with mercenaries.

439
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,792
It was stupid to bring a mercenary here !

440
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,399
Laura, tell him...

441
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,956
I know the people from the sertao !

442
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:44,994
But the mercenaries, they have to
be treated by the whip !

443
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,077
Even Batista saw me talking to him !

444
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,872
Won't you shut up !?

445
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,153
I've talked to him.
Nothing to do about that.

446
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,350
He became mad, he shouted.

447
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,516
He looked like a beast.

448
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,757
He does not understand anything, 
and doesn't want to.

449
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,719
Antonio, you're my friend,
Aren't you ?

450
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,153
I allowed you to leave your home...

451
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:15,035
There, you lived hiding and in ignorance.

452
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,753
Don't you want money, Antonio ?

453
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,110
If you want some, I'll give it to you.

454
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,440
Coirana is dead, don't you understand ?

455
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:33,595
From a loge, I looked at
your failures, Mattress

456
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,589
People of the Garden of the Piranhas !

457
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:45,029
Come to see the judgement

458
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,390
of a rare riffraff.

459
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,590
Come to see the protégé of the coronel !

460
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:17,268
From a loge, I looked at
your failures, Mattress

461
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,469
Shut up, wanderer !

462
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,398
You're just a drunkard,

463
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,034
and you have to show me respect !

464
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,678
Since a long time,
I was searching for my place.

465
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,190
Now, I've found it.

466
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,236
It's at the side of the Saint.

467
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,278
I understand where is the real enemy.

468
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,279
Who is here ?

469
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,078
God bless you...

470
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,553
Mata Vaca!

471
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,636
A true mercenary from the Minas.

472
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,914
Sit down, my son.

473
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,388
Laura, where are you ?

474
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,031
Mattos, you're a poor wretch!

475
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:59,114
A traitor, an ill dog !

476
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,799
A miserable dog !

477
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,672
I rise you from the mud,

478
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,791
I promess you the prefecture,

479
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,560
Is this how you thank me ?

480
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,832
By sleeping with my wife ?

481
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:16,278
You spoiled my happiness,
you broke my life !

482
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:20,514
My friend, Mata Vaca, is here

483
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,278
to kill Antonio das Mortes.

484
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,074
But you'll be the first to die !

485
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,630
You were like my own son.
I would have done anything for you.

486
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,751
That's a lie !

487
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,032
Shut up ! Batista saw you !
Batista told me !

488
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,434
Batista is my friend.

489
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,437
Mata Vaca, bring her here !

490
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,314
They'll kiss in front of the all town.

491
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,430
Kiss her !

492
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,713
I can't see, but
I want everybody else to see.

493
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,388
Mata Vaca, make them kiss.

494
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,879
I've lost my eyes in the sertao !

495
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,516
I can't see.
But the town can see !

496
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,513
Make them kiss, Mata Vaca!

497
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,708
May the people see these traitors !

498
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,557
Make them kiss now, Mata Vaca !

499
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:28,912
It's the truth.
Batista saw you.

500
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:33,875
Kiss !
I want the whole town to see you.

501
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,999
Batista, what have they done to you ?
You can't die, my friend !

502
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,469
You promised to get me away !

503
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,237
Save me.
I love you, I swear.

504
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,598
Stop, Mata Vaca!

505
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,231
Batista, where are you ?

506
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,956
Where are you, Batista?.

507
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,278
Mata Vaca, where is Batista ?

508
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:21,318
What did they do to you, my friend ?

509
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,189
Not only traitors,
but murderers.

510
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,990
You are the lackey of the coronel,

511
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:33,038
you'll always be his lackey.

512
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,272
Admit it.

513
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,674
You're a coward.

514
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,949
A coward, a coward...

515
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,637
Now, you have to choose.

516
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:56,592
Die inside, or die outside.

517
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:00,237
Mattos, take your decision !

518
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,196
Don't worry Horacio.

519
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,319
I'll kill this dog.

520
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,472
Mata Vaca, did you get him ?

521
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,392
You killed him !

522
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,475
Batista, we are avenged.

523
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,157
We are avenged, Batista.

524
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:09,438
We are avenged.

525
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:26,954
Then came Corisco

526
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,677
and Lampiao

527
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:40,156
with leather hat

528
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:47,395
and a rifle at hand

529
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,433
My Saint...

530
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,714
This cangaceiro is mine.

531
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:24,317
Let me bury him 
at the heart of this sertao.

532
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,114
Mata Vaca...

533
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,716
End that act of Justice.

534
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,999
You must put an end to the pestiferous.

535
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,434
Professor !

536
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:19,076
the coronel did order to kill
the saint and her retinue.

537
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,797
And Antonio das Mortes disappeared.

538
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,671
We have to make something !

539
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,388
He ordered to kill them.

540
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,751
The coronel ordered to kill them.

541
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:37,077
We have to do something !

542
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,870
I can't do anything just by myself.
This one's already dead !

543
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,956
We must care about the living ones!

544
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,991
Care about the living !

545
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,830
Laura, protect me
from the devil of obscurity !

546
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,519
Come, Laura.

547
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:37,038
I dreamed that Antonio das Mortes
was killing me.

548
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:40,516
Come near me, Laura.
Protect me.

549
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,439
Mata Vaca must come !

550
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:44,638
Antonio das Mortes is going to kill me.

551
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,677
It's destiny, my Saint,

552
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,630
that did retain my hand.

553
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,912
I've lost my strength.

554
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,477
I'm not good at anything, anymore.

555
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,917
I'll leave !
Get back to the city !

556
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:58,993
And it's the same misfortune
I'll find there !

557
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:05,397
We'll keep bearing the suffering.

558
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,512
Brazil !

559
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,553
And one day an endless war...

560
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,358
will start.

561
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,555
Rise from the dust, rise !

562
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,879
Rise from the dust, rise !

563
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:12,118
I cried, without hiding.

564
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:15,591
Everyone saw me.

565
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:22,670
I wasn't the only one to cry.

566
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,395
But rising like I did,

567
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,909
who could have done the same ?

568
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:31,710
A strong man

569
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,797
does not stay lying,

570
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,673
refusing that a woman

571
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:37,830
could give her hand to him

572
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:42,352
He recognizes his defeat
and don't lose courage.

573
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:46,749
Rise from the dust, rise !

574
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:51,275
Rise from the dust, rise !

575
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:19,438
Hundred of old negros died,
they were not working anymore

576
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:25,398
A bastard named Traz-Ca,
turned and fell behind

577
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:29,795
dirty-muzzle and Mustache
- his war name -

578
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,639
Satan's brother-in-law

579
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:39,958
Here came Lampiao
at the gates of hell

580
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:45,997
A boy, still young,
appeared at the gate

581
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:49,114
Who are you horseman ?

582
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:53,711
I'm a cangaceiro,
answered Lampiao

583
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:59,876
I'm not your guardian, and
not your comrade

584
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:05,552
You won't enter here,
except if you tell your name

585
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:10,989
Boy, open the door,
I am Lampiao

586
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,589
Terror for the entire world

587
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:23,232
This guardian, responsible for the gate

588
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:28,112
seeing him like this,
didn't ask questions any more

589
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:32,354
The Negro knows to write,
but can't read

590
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,869
Here, forgiveness has no place

591
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:40,917
Then the guardian came and said :
wait for me outside

592
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:45,518
I'm going to talk with the chief
at the central bureau

593
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,071
If he refuses you

594
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:52,353
depending on what he'll say,
I'll accept you, or not

595
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:59,471
Lampiao said : make your mind,
who talks lose time

596
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:04,310
Go and come back, quick,
I won't wait for long

597
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:09,475
If they let me enter,
I'll ransack enverything

598
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,875
I'll burn the place and then i'll go away

599
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:12,914
the guardian found Satan
at the saloon

600
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:17,837
Know my Lord that Lampiao is at the door

601
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:22,035
And pretend to be willing to enter

602
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:24,794
Should I let him do so ?

603
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:31,513
No, answered Satan,
Tell him to go away

604
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:36,312
There's only riffraff coming in,
I'm furious

605
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:43,069
I'd like to
 drive out half of the ones
that are already in.

606
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:50,759
Lampiao is a bandit,
a thief of honesty

607
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:55,439
he wants to spread confusion

608
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:00,109
why would we encumber ourselves 
with such a man

609
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,675
without absolute necessity ?

610
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:08,318
The guardian said :
Lord, what a disaster !

611
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:13,516
There will be uprising,
if we don't let him enter

612
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:19,469
Don't worry, said Satan,
call the negros

613
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:22,319
Take as many as you need

614
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:27,832
Hundreds should come, men and women

615
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:32,758
go to the warehouse, and take all
the weapons you need

616
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:39,554
Other fellows of Lucifer
should be advised too

617
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,911
The negros came

618
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,350
first, came Fuchico

619
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:50,193
armed with an old rifle
and shouting to Pea-brain

620
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:56,596
to bring his whip
and to call Tangença by Maçarico

621
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:02,711
Then came Cambota,
checking his weapons

622
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:07,273
Formigueiro, Trupe-Zupe
and Quele came

623
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:11,675
then Banzeiro, Pacaia,
Rabisca, Cordao de Saia

624
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:14,155
and finally, Baze

625
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:23,118
Then came a young she-devil
dressed with fine lingerie

626
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:28,599
She pushed the fence, and said
that it was some bad times

627
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:31,311
And that today would be a hard day

628
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:35,593
She shouted at the Baiana,
that now, it was serious

629
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:41,278
Then this armed band 
went to the camp

630
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:46,112
With rifles, sabers and daggers

631
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:50,355
There was negress with her cook knife

632
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,915
and her manioc rammer

633
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:00,512
When Lampiao saw
this band of armed negros

634
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,952
He said : 
It's only in Abyssinia

635
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:05,355
where we should find such an army

636
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:09,634
Arms at hands,
the chief of this army shouted :

637
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,400
Everyone on him, my negros !

638
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:15,312
Antonio das Mortes !

639
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:23,069
Mata Vaca and a handfull of mercenaries are here,

640
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:26,797
ready to pour their own blood

641
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:29,869
to defend their protector.

642
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:34,916
Listen to me.
I fought against Lampaio,

643
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,792
and against Antonio Conselheiro,

644
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,270
But I'm one of them.


645
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,558
Antonio das Mortes !

646
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:46,039
Show that you're a man.

647
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:51,708
Let's fight at the front of this church.

648
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:55,312
with this coward crowd,
hiding behind windows

649
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,159
and under the beds, 
for witness

650
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:01,632
Antonio das Mortes !

651
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:09,550
If God helps a criminal

652
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,357
Then he'll help me :

653
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:16,192
I've shed less blood than you.

654
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:18,756
Show that you're a man !

655
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,872
Coronel!

656
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,636
The time has come.

657
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:30,437
The town will open its eyes.

658
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:36,195
The one who talks
never shed any blood,

659
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:40,593
But he's ready to shed his own

660
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:45,239
to avenge the humiliated sertao.

661
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,912
And I'd say like the holy Book :

662
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:53,918
" An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. "

663
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,311
You truly are the angel of the Pest,

664
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:59,515
The mad beast I was waiting for.

665
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,914
It could not have been Coirana.

666
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,628
It could only be someone like you,

667
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:10,991
One of these wanderers,
who came from the cities

668
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,794
to sow the ideas of destruction.

669
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,595
Talk, goon, I'm listening to you.

670
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:19,915
Professor,

671
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:23,714
I wanted to say...

672
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:28,595
We are fighting together,

673
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,476
but not with the same weapons.

674
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,309
yours are political,

675
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,116
mine have to do with God.

676
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,119
Okay, Antonio.

677
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:45,636
We share the enemy.

678
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:50,078
You keep all your bravery.


679
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,436
I'll stay in your shadow.

680
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,672
No, professor.

681
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,634
Fight with your ideals,

682
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,790
they matter much more than me.

683
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,228
I want to see the famous Mata Vaca !

684
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:11,234
Coward, son of an ape !

685
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,874
God, let me end my task.

686
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:19,472
I'm readying myself to show up before You.

687
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:40,111
The battle was now lasting since
more than one hour

688
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:44,758
Dust was flying everywhere
and the negros were crying

689
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:50,997
Lampiao, even if wounded,
would not give away

690
01:29:55,800 --> 01:30:00,157
Lampiao threw a rock at a dog

691
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:04,712
But the rock blew up
the window of the store

692
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:10,952
A fire started to grow
in the cotton reserve

693
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:18,192
Satan, looking at the fire,
called his men back

694
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:24,116
All the negros came to him

695
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:30,037
Lampiao went away, having no more enemies

696
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:39,278
This day was a great loss for Satan

697
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:43,958
All his wealth burned to dust

698
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:50,470
his record book burned,
and all his goods

699
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:56,352
Lucifer said :
No more horrors,

700
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:00,998
why such a misfortune ?

701
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:06,993
I'll have the longest winter of my life !

702
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:14,556
And now I'm going to end up 
that story with Lampaio

703
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:18,998
This is not my business,
but I give you my point of view

704
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:24,760
He is not in heaven, nor in hell,
but still is in the sertao !

705
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:31,113
If you don't believe my story

706
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:35,639
If you do not trust my honesty

707
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:39,836
You can write in hell and ask to Satan

708
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:42,793
If this story is true, or not

709
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:18,236
Cursed by ten chruches

710
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:29,116
Rejected by all saints

711
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:37,754
Antonio das Mortes

712
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:46,193
Killer of cangaceiros...
