1
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,398
? My mother was a Baptist, boys

2
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,358
? My father was a Jew

3
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,954
? My sister married an orphan

4
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,237
? At the battle of Waterloo

5
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,039
? Don't ever kiss a Hindu, boys

6
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,918
? Unless you are engaged

7
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,798
? True love is never found with girls

8
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,838
? Who dance upon the stage

9
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,388
? Andy Jackson saw a bear

10
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,119
? And chased him up a tree

11
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,634
? A hound dog would
have caught the fox

12
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,188
? If he hadn't stopped to...

13
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,275
? My mother was a Baptist, boys

14
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,035
? My father was a Jew

15
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,510
? My sister married an orphan

16
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,354
? At the battle of Waterloo

17
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,230
Hello, Two Crows.

18
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,311
(speaks Kiowa)

19
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,438
(speaks Kiowa)

20
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,117
- Like hell we will.
- (speaks Kiowa)

21
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,637
Damn your eyes, I spent all
winter getting them furs.

22
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,599
And they're not for
trade here. (speaks Kiowa)

23
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,830
(speaks Kiowa)

24
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,395
What the hell do I want
with him? (speaks Kiowa)

25
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,912
I don't care how you got him.

26
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,918
Wait a minute. I know he's brave as a
buffalo. You don't have to slice him up.

27
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,037
I don't want him. (speaks Kiowa)

28
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,310
You're all right, Two Crows.
You ought to be a white man.

29
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,597
You'd be captain of the steamboat
and president of the bank.

30
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,990
Just cos you own this damn country.

31
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,511
(whooping)

32
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,629
(shouts in Kiowa)

33
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,195
(speaks Kiowa)

34
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,792
What are you standing there
for? Can't you speak English?

35
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,916
- No, sir.
- What do you mean, "No, sir"?

36
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,514
I mean I wish I didn't.

37
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,989
Come over here.

38
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,231
Turn around.

39
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,590
You sure don't look like you're
worth a winter trapping of furs.

40
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,878
No, sir, I'm not. In fact,
sir, I'm not worth anything.

41
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,236
- What's your name?
- Joseph Winfield Lee.

42
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,874
Formerly of the Comanche tribe,
until stolen by the Kiowas.

43
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,511
- You're far from home. You run away?
- As the spirits directed me, sir.

44
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,752
You don't talk like a field slave.
You kill anybody when you ran off?

45
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,149
No, sir. That's contrary to the law.

46
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,834
You think what those Indians
did to me was the law?

47
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,196
- Just cos I'm trespassing?
- No, sir.

48
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,193
Caveat emptor legalis
semper. Let the buyer beware.

49
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,478
- I've heard that said.
- Where'd you learn them wise remarks?

50
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,192
I was privileged to associate with one of
the best-educated families in Louisiana.

51
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,273
- I can read, write and cipher.
- Don't brag on it.

52
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,029
- Pick up that bag. Let's go.
- Where to?

53
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,999
To get my furs back. Where
the hell do you think?

54
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,671
Can I ask you a question, sir? How
do you plan to fight all those Kiowas?

55
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,232
By natural application of superior tactics,
Massachusetts wit, and left-handed skill.

56
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,709
Oh. You're gonna shoot 'em, sir.

57
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,554
Hell, no. There's a cask
of trade rum in that pack.

58
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,236
Them Indians'll have a drunk party and
I'll get back my packhorse and furs.

59
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,517
- What about me, sir?
- I'll sell you to the highest bidder.

60
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,431
Could you make that to a Comanche?

61
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,956
You seem to have a prejudice
against serving the white race.

62
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,511
I don't mean to be narrow in my attitude.
Could I ask you what's your name, sir?

63
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,670
Joe Bass.

64
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,756
Well, Mr Bass, couldn't you kinda
consider me a captured Comanche?

65
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,989
I came on foot as
far as the Comanches.

66
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,833
It was my intention to
circle south to Mexico.

67
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,115
The Mexicans have a
law against slavery.

68
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:42,753
And since those Indians captured me from
Indians, I now have full Indian citizenship.

69
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,114
- Joseph Lee, you ever study the law?
- No, sir.

70
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,193
Neither did I. But you ain't got a chance
in hell of calling yourself an Indian.

71
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,909
You're African. Slave by
employment, black by colour.

72
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,913
You ain't gonna walk good
enough to catch them Kiowas.

73
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,755
- I guess I'm a failure as a packhorse, sir.
- A man don't ever say quit, Joseph Lee.

74
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,434
No, sir. He doesn't.

75
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,715
Hand me that bag.

76
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,275
Crab onto her tail.

77
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,998
See the superiority of the white-skinned
race when it comes to walking.

78
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,553
My ancestors were famous as liars,
walkers and patriots. Are you patriotic?

79
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,077
Yes, sir. Fourth of July I
generally set up quite a holler.

80
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,073
Of course, if someone came along
now they might figure you own me.

81
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,072
- You're riding, I'm walking.
- But that's not the case.

82
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,199
In a manner of speaking, you are the
image of my packhorse and fur pelts.

83
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,033
- I'd take good care of 'em, wouldn't I?
- Yes, sir.

84
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,352
They're a valuable wholesale
or retail commodity.

85
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,635
You wouldn't be thinking of
grabbing those reins and running off?

86
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,836
I doubt it, sir.

87
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,231
- You doubt it?
- I'm not sure of the directions.

88
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,190
I haven't any food and, as a Comanche,
I might run into those Kiowas again.

89
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,877
Tired?

90
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,590
You hear that? Two Crows and his boys
are in that gully having a hell of a time.

91
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,708
You just sit here and rest for about
five minutes while I take a look.

92
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,795
Pick 'em up.

93
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,596
- I've decided what I'm gonna do with you.
- Sell me to Egypt.

94
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,356
I'm gonna sell you in St Louis. You'll retail
for about 15 mules and 10 bales of cotton.

95
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,477
- Yes, sir.
- Don't try to run. You can't get nowhere.

96
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,232
- Yes, sir.
- And shut up.

97
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,470
Yes, sir.

98
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,031
Shh!

99
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,033
Well, Mr Bass, there
they are. Go get 'em.

100
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,918
Just like that?

101
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,958
I'd say they're considerably
under the influence.

102
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:08,149
- You ever fight 12 drunk Indians?
- No, sir. But I'd like to see it done.

103
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,115
As a Comanche, what I'd
do is run off their horses.

104
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,079
You're an African
Comanche. But you're right.

105
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,150
- You see that brush?
- Yes, sir.

106
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,357
- I want you to get down there.
- Right now, sir?

107
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,000
When it gets dark. That's
mesquite. It'll burn.

108
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,197
- I want you to start a fire.
- What'll you do, sir?

109
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,078
When they go for the fire,
I'll stampede their horses.

110
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,596
They'll be so drunk, I'll get my
packhorse and furs and be gone.

111
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,752
- Can I say something, Mr Bass?
- What is it?

112
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,789
If you're gonna sell me back into being
a runaway slave, do it all yourself.

113
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,631
Of course, if you help me get to
Mexico, then maybe I'll help you.

114
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:01,239
Joseph Lee, I expect that someday
you'll be president of the Bank of Omaha.

115
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,392
But right now you're going
down there and do as I tell you.

116
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,199
Or I'll skin your black carcass.

117
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,989
Get my rifle. Go on.

118
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,351
Over there!

119
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,110
All right, let's go!

120
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,075
Scalphunters.

121
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:08,838
Collect a $25 bounty on Indian scalps.
Men, women and children. Like jackals.

122
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,753
Territory government pays it.

123
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,913
Dirtiest, rottenest trade
ever turned a dollar.

124
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,031
- Let's go.
- Where are we going, sir?

125
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,270
After 'em.

126
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,191
After 'em?

127
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,832
How the hell do you think I'm going to
get my furs back if I don't go after 'em?

128
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,358
Mr Bass, I do not intend to put
up with any more of this walking.

129
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,352
Now, either you slow
down and talk to me,

130
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:14,310
or I'll just have to pull you off that horse
and knock you on your high-priced pants.

131
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,551
Are you deaf as well as dumb, Mr Bass?

132
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,996
Mr Bass, you're threatening my temper.

133
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,275
Mr Bass!

134
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,317
Mr Bass.

135
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,633
Sir, why are you so bound and determined
to catch up with those murdering people?

136
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,359
Haven't you got anything else to do?

137
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,193
I just don't say
something, then not do it.

138
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,115
I am completely and
absolutely exhausted. Empty.

139
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,998
- I've got to have something to eat.
- You ate yesterday.

140
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:57,237
Mr Bass, I have been trained in the habit
of eating each and every individual day.

141
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,836
That proves you ain't a Comanche.
Comanche would keep going till he died.

142
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,835
- I'm so hungry I could eat a frog or snake.
- Comanches do. Regular.

143
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,912
- But I'm not a Comanche.
- Aha!

144
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,871
Oh, Mr Bass.

145
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,991
You see that?

146
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,789
Sego lily. Just like an onion.
Finest thing you ever saw.

147
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,916
You see this?

148
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,117
Sagebrush. Crows where
nothing else will.

149
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,478
You make Indian tea out of the leaves,
and it makes a passable fodder for stock.

150
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:51,031
Look around you, Joseph
Lee. All natural creation.

151
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,237
Maguey. Makes a fine soap
for washing down a squaw.

152
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,073
Brings the bloom of
sunrise to her skin.

153
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,151
Watch this.

154
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,838
A needle and thread.
For sewing things.

155
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,718
Here we are, Joseph Lee,
in the Carden of Eden.

156
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,075
Just like Adam and Eve.

157
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:20,154
Chokecherries. They make a
fine pudding. You like pudding?

158
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,433
Joseph Lee, let's eat.

159
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,438
Go get 'em, Joseph Lee. I'm hungry.

160
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,314
I guess a slave like you got fed
pretty good in that big house kitchen.

161
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,516
Sleeping in a bed every night.

162
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,319
Maybe you should have
stayed where you was.

163
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,039
Vir libre quam in servitude.

164
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,839
"Better beans in freedom
than cake in slavery."

165
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,151
Aesop. And he was a slave
himself back in the Creek times.

166
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,879
Trouble with you is
you read too many books.

167
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,557
You call it right when a man's a
slave? Owned, worked, beat all the time?

168
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,473
Natural state of affairs, Joseph Lee.

169
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,869
Black man started being
a slave in the Bible.

170
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,398
If Cod didn't want it that way, Cod
wouldn't have done it. Consult your Bible.

171
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,517
Cod didn't invent
slavery. The Egyptians did.

172
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,433
Sold all the children of Israel.

173
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,909
That ain't the way I read Scripture.

174
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,275
- What about Julius Caesar?
- Who?

175
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,275
Julius Caesar. He was an Italian. He
made slaves out of all you Englishmen.

176
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,272
Julius Caesar made slaves
of every kind of white man.

177
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,035
Put chains on 'em, dragged 'em back
to Rome and fed 'em to the lions.

178
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:13,592
Africans like me, we didn't
care that much for Julius Caesar.

179
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,075
Never heard of him.

180
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,152
That's cos you don't know how to read.

181
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,551
- I could bust you in the jaw.
- Wouldn't change anything.

182
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,792
And it wouldn't change you into a
white man. Get that through your head.

183
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,031
Let's see you write your name.

184
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,795
Let's see you feed
yourself, Julius Caesar.

185
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,110
You wait here, Joseph Lee. I'm
going to take a look around.

186
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,679
- Mr Bass!
- Shh!

187
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,639
Go down there and those people will
just kill the literal hell outta you.

188
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,711
Now, don't you move.

189
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,917
Mr Bass.

190
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,797
Shh.

191
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,753
Howie! How many times I gotta tell
you? Get that sack of hair off my wagon.

192
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,071
Now, Kate, honey, them
scalps is worth $25 apiece.

193
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,276
That don't mean we
gotta sleep with 'em.

194
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,909
- That little old smell bother you?
- That ain't all that's bothering me.

195
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,877
Kate. Kate.

196
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,315
- Morning, Miss Kate.
- Morning, Mr Howie.

197
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,072
Shut up.

198
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,119
Go get some clothes on. I don't
want these men getting horny notions.

199
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,997
Stop talking like a preacher.

200
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,834
If I had half the boots been under
my bed, I could outfit the US Cavalry.

201
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,469
- Hush and get back inside that wagon.
- I'm sick of that damn wagon.

202
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,950
Washing with no bathtub,
getting rats in my hair.

203
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,395
- I'm living like a squaw.
- Kate, honey.

204
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,519
Look at my skin. It's all dried up.
Soon I'm gonna look like an old prune.

205
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,160
- I like prunes.
- Howie, I'm warning you.

206
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,030
If you don't find someplace I can live
decent, you'll be sleeping with your horse.

207
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,953
Kate, honey. It's gonna be all right.

208
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,988
And stop chewing that damn tobacco!
You ever kiss anybody chewed tobacco?

209
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,636
Ain't she darling? Now you get
those horses hitched and let's move!

210
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,079
Move!

211
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,237
Damn.

212
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,071
Now, Kate, honey.

213
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,356
Don't get your pretty little
dooly-dooly all fussed up.

214
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,035
We was gonna have a fancy
house. With servants.

215
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,351
At last I was gonna live like a lady.

216
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,238
I should've stayed where I was.

217
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,792
You know, I knew a lady one
time. Chewed snuff. A redhead.

218
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,111
She'd stand on a piano and
sing songs. Damn. (giggles)

219
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,476
Jim Howie, you got as much
feelings as a bald-headed hog.

220
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,516
Oh, Kate, honey.

221
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,071
There's no cause to talk that way. I'm
gonna get you these things. I told you.

222
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,636
Oh...

223
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,718
Centlemen. Am I glad to see you.

224
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:48,909
I have been chased and run over
every rock pile for the past 50 miles.

225
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,189
I saw your wagons, and I knew right there
my trials and tribulations were over.

226
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,355
- Anybody with you?
- Nobody, sir. Nobody at all.

227
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,989
- What's your name, son?
- Black Feather, sir.

228
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,914
I was adopted into the Wolf
tribe of the Comanche nation.

229
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,358
The Kiowas set up a terrible slaughter
on us three days ago. I escaped.

230
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,479
I'll just travel along with you
gentlemen till I get back to my tribe.

231
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,157
- What'll he sell for, Jed?
- Oh, about 1,000.

232
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,995
1500 on the Calveston block, if
he ain't lame or got belly worms.

233
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,469
Throw a rope on him.

234
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,676
- Let's move out!
- (Lee) Hey! Hey!

235
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,752
Wait! Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

236
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,671
Stop! Wait!

237
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,197
I started out in life a
prosperous, good-looking trapper.

238
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,909
And now, by Cod, I ain't
even got a slave no more.

239
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,675
- Whoa!
- Hey, hold on.

240
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,871
- Get up there, boy. Come on.
- No, sir.

241
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,554
- I said get up there. Right now.
- No, sir.

242
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,234
What the hell's going on
down here? Camp meeting?

243
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,950
I'm not gonna be worth anything
like this. Ruined on my feet.

244
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,076
- Drag him!
- Sir!

245
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,233
I'd be worth much more to you if you let
me ride. Besides, I'm slowing you down.

246
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,790
- Holding you back.
- That's the first good sense I heard today.

247
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,714
You hush up and read your stargazing
book and let me run my business.

248
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,839
Then why don't you run it like
you knew what you was doing?

249
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,080
Look at that. Ain't she pretty?

250
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,076
All right, let him ride. Move it out!

251
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,151
Thank you, sir.

252
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,350
Not now, Julius Caesar.

253
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,715
(Howie) Heading for church, sonny?

254
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,199
No, sir, Mr Howie.

255
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,398
I was just, um... making a
botanical study, you might say.

256
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,517
You see that? Sagebrush.
Crows where nothing else will.

257
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,593
Make Indian tea from the leaves, and
it makes a passable fodder for stock.

258
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,955
Look around you, Mr Howie.

259
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:16,797
All natural creation! Here we are in the
Carden of Eden. Just like Adam and Eve.

260
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:22,193
- Get that water the hell back up there.
- Yes, sir, Mr Howie. Yes, sir.

261
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:41,271
- Beans, beans, beans. I'll look like beans.
- Nothing wrong with beans, honey.

262
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,920
I like beans.

263
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,673
What I wouldn't give
for a decent meal.

264
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,274
On a white linen tablecloth,

265
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,999
all fixed up nice.

266
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,232
I listen to you, Jim Howie, and I end
up bouncing over every rock in creation.

267
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,073
My hair's all snarled
up like a dish mop.

268
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,913
When we gonna start
living in some kinda style?

269
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,390
When the hell we ever
gonna get to Mexico?

270
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,748
Miss Kate.

271
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,116
You see that? Maguey.

272
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,996
Did you know that that makes
a fine soap for a lady's care?

273
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,958
Brings the bloom of
sunrise to her skin.

274
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,349
Used in the ancient times
by the Queen of Sheba

275
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,672
to restore the natural oils
to her beautiful blonde hair.

276
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,117
- You mean that old common cactus?
- Yes, Miss Kate.

277
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,953
Botanical name Vir pluribus undulatum.

278
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,077
Known to the Comanches as maguey.

279
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,671
Really? You mean...

280
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,435
Yes, Miss Kate.

281
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,756
You sure this won't fade out my natural
colour and turn it into somethin' horsey?

282
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,434
Oh, no, Miss Kate. On the contrary.

283
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,436
Did I hear you say you
were going to Mexico?

284
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,957
Cot to. All the law in the country's
looking for me and Jim Howie.

285
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,795
Oh, Mexico's a wonderful country,
Miss Kate. The haciendas and all that.

286
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,835
- You been to Mexico?
- Uh, no, ma'am.

287
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,913
But I speak the language. Buenos
dias, buenas noches, muchas gracias.

288
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,515
Why, you'll be right in the most
high-toned society, Miss Kate. A lady.

289
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,879
First thing I'm gonna get rid of this
busted corset and buy me some fancy clothes.

290
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:47,478
You'll need quality trained servants. Takes
proper service to put on the right style.

291
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,232
Oh?

292
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,311
You mean like you?

293
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,748
I'd be honoured to
serve you, Miss Kate.

294
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,676
Jim Howie's dead set on selling
you on the Calveston block.

295
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,479
No way around that.

296
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:20,195
Jim Howie don't always do
everything he sets his mind to.

297
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,798
You have a very interesting
texture to your hair.

298
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,078
Fine like gossamer.
Like Helen of Troy.

299
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,672
Well, he fixed it pretty fancy, huh?

300
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,790
I wonder what he's after.

301
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,391
Mighty fine, boy.

302
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,632
Sego lily, Mr Howie. Just like an
onion. Finest thing you ever saw.

303
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,998
- What the hell are you after?
- After, Mr Howie? After?

304
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,719
He just likes to serve quality folk.

305
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,995
Quality folk!

306
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,196
Coddamn.

307
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,078
I don't wanna hear
that mushmouth, honey.

308
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,029
I got a rope burn on my neck where they
tried to hang me one time in Sacramento.

309
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,430
And the first time I met you
was in Ma Hogan's tent, remember?

310
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,273
And you weren't exactly sewing canvas.

311
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,352
- You hush your mouth now, Howie.
- Quality folk!

312
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,591
And I never worked no tent.

313
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,994
Dammit, can't you say
I'm pretty or somethin'?

314
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:56,349
You're the prettiest woman that ever
wore garters and crossed her legs.

315
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,318
Howie, stop chewing that tobacco.

316
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,478
Come on, honey. Let's dance.

317
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,992
You look mighty elegant, Miss Kate.

318
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,551
Bailemos, compadre.

319
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,631
(whooping)

320
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,918
(music stops)

321
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,429
(laughter)

322
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,954
Come on, Joseph Lee. Fight him.

323
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,878
- Go on, boy. Let's see you fight.
- Punch him again.

324
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,033
(man) Come on, boy.
You can fight him, boy.

325
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,634
Move in on him. Bust him one.

326
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,836
(man) Come on, boy.

327
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,837
(man #2) Look out,
Yuma, he'll hurt you!

328
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,197
Come on, Julius Caesar. Fight him.

329
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,271
- Get up, boy.
- (man) Hit him again. Hit him!

330
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,393
The old daddy wolf
does the cutting here.

331
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,319
You don't wanna damage
our $1500 property.

332
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,112
You go soak your head, boy.

333
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,794
Cimme back my feathers.

334
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,394
Crab your partner!

335
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,438
Julius Caesar, you're a hell of a
dancing man, but you sure can't fight.

336
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,555
See that guard over
there by the horses?

337
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,359
Go over there and give him
some of that fancy talk.

338
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,399
I'll sneak up and bust him one. Then
we'll load up my furs and get out.

339
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,756
The both of us. Damn you,
Lee, aren't you listening?

340
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,308
- I'm not sure if I am or not, Mr Bass.
- What?

341
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,675
I like you, Mr Bass.

342
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,116
You treated me decent.
And you're a religious man.

343
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,670
Know all about Ham, the black
man in the Bible. Adam and Eve.

344
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,629
- What the hell are you talking about?
- These people are going to Mexico.

345
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,633
You mean... you mean you're
going to stay with these heathens?

346
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,188
Well, you see, Mr Bass...

347
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,670
Mr Bass, you'd better consult
Mr Howie. He owns me now.

348
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,513
- Why, damn your black hide, I traded...
- Shh!

349
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:49,756
Oh, Mr Bass. Well,
then, you'll understand.

350
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:54,072
A slave has no choice of masters.
Just goes to the highest bidder.

351
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,720
Mr Howie's bidding Mexico.

352
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,429
Fine country, Mexico.
I think I'll like it.

353
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,636
No slavery there.

354
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,473
I oughta kill you...

355
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,551
(gurgling)

356
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,356
I'll show him. That damned
ungrateful black Comanche.

357
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,477
You stay here and be quiet.
And stop eating that tree.

358
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,030
Unless you're gonna
double-cross me too.

359
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,829
Go get Yancy some food.

360
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,231
(whinnying)

361
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,872
All right, I've got you.
Easy does it. There you go.

362
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,951
Whoa, boy.

363
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,471
Easy, boy. Easy.

364
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,957
Shh!

365
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,956
Hey, Yan...

366
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,591
Hey, Yancy!

367
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,111
Howie!

368
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,435
Howie!

369
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,073
Come on, jughead. This
is no time to quit on me.

370
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:15,515
- All right, what was it?
- A renegade Apache.

371
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,393
Joe Bass, you socialise with these people,
you're gonna get yourself scalped...

372
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,072
Miss Kate.

373
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,630
The night air's
chill. You need a wrap.

374
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:47,516
? In our lovely Deseret

375
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:52,674
? Where the saints of Cod have met

376
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:59,313
? Tea and coffee and
tobacco we despise

377
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,836
? We've no liquor, yet we eat

378
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,912
? Just a very little meat

379
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,439
? We are seeking to be
great and good and wise

380
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,637
- ? We should not forget to pray
- Please, Kate.

381
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,475
- ? Night and morning every day
- Will you stop singing Mormon songs?

382
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,757
Get out of that bed, you
lazy bum. It's Sunday morning.

383
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,990
(coughs)

384
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,992
? And we always be polite

385
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:33,119
? And treat everybody right

386
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,557
Now, Kate, you ain't even a
Mormon. So will you shut up?

387
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,997
? Hark, hark, hark,
'tis angels' voices

388
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,671
(laughter)

389
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,518
Anything funny?

390
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,113
Get me some water, boy.

391
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,997
Yes, sir.

392
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,799
(gunshot)

393
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,156
Don't reach for nothing, mister.

394
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:06,955
Walk up here, mister, or
I'll kill you where you stand.

395
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,631
Easy.

396
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,952
I knew it. It's the law.

397
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,471
No, ma'am.

398
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,358
I mean, I hope not, Miss Kate.

399
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:49,635
That's close enough.
Take your hat off.

400
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,435
Now reach up and scratch your ear.

401
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,670
"Scratch your...?"

402
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,117
You want to keep that ear, turn that
packhorse loose and get on your way.

403
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,237
- Them beaver skins is mine.
- Yours?

404
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:10,518
I risked my life for them pelts.
I fought me a dozen Kiowas.

405
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,876
You slaughtered 'em,
you scalphunting bastard.

406
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,394
Now, hold on.

407
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,040
That's no cause to dry-gulch a man.

408
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:24,069
Steal his furs. Wreck his water
barrel. You know, that ain't fair.

409
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,439
Cut loose that packhorse!

410
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,593
I ain't gonna kill you, but I ought to.
Now go on back there and keep moving.

411
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,432
Walk!

412
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,349
You crook!

413
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,675
Let's get outta here!

414
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,197
That bushwhacking half-breed.
We'll give him his furs back.

415
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,238
Dead. Let's move it out.

416
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,029
Frank!

417
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,112
Get Yuma and flank that half-breed.

418
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,589
Hold it here. Keep
that first wagon moving.

419
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,792
Oh, Mr Bass. Those
furs aren't worth it.

420
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,792
- What did you say, boy?
- Nothing, Mr Howie. Nothing.

421
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,518
Hey, bushwhacker.

422
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,751
Set your gun down.

423
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,190
- Howie, we gotta...
- Will you shut up, Kate?

424
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,319
Looking for me, scalphunter?

425
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,197
Lay that gun down.

426
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,319
Damn. Frank's got him!

427
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,757
There he is! Come on, get him.

428
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,229
Renegade Apache.

429
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,839
Renegade Apache, my ass!

430
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,398
Hey, Howie!

431
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,959
Jim!

432
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:35,559
Clear them rocks away.

433
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,671
Hey, mister!

434
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,192
Cut loose that packhorse and furs.

435
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,916
Move that wagon or I'll roll
half this mountain down on you.

436
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,390
Whoa! Hold on, friend.

437
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,030
You've got me.

438
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,237
Kate, get off that wagon.

439
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,274
- Howie, be careful.
- Now, you, Kate, hush up.

440
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:30,238
All right, move that wagon on down.

441
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,396
All right. Hold on, we're going.

442
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,880
OK, boy. Cimme a hand.

443
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,951
Mount your horses.

444
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,389
Get in that wagon. Cit.

445
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:58,198
- Virgo's passed Jupiter in the third phase.
- What?

446
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:02,795
Sagittarius and Cassiopeia
are in the ascendancy.

447
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:06,518
That's right. How'd you know that?

448
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:11,989
Miss Kate, when is
Mr Howie's birthday?

449
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:15,311
He's a Leo. July 27th.

450
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,231
July 27th. I was afraid of that.

451
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:23,392
You sure Virgo is passing Jupiter?

452
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:28,873
Mr Howie is a strong, powerful
man. A Leo. A natural leader, right?

453
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,714
Did you know that Napoleon
Bonaparte was a Leo too, Miss Kate?

454
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:37,749
The same birthday as Mr Howie.
And when he met Waterloo...

455
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:42,277
Destroyed. Virgo had passed
Jupiter in the third phase.

456
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,954
That's gonna happen now.

457
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:48,510
Did you really study all
about reading the stars?

458
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:52,036
Well, as far back as the,
um, Egyptian Pharaohs.

459
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:56,477
And the Hebrew prophets. Down through
Persia, Babylon and Mesopotamia.

460
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:01,315
Shalom, abi gezunt,
aleph, beth, gimel.

461
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,915
Tell me, how's it gonna
be for Virgo? I'm a Virgo.

462
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,872
Pythagoras.

463
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:14,918
I see a cloud. A threatening cloud.

464
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,798
Travelling. Travelling.

465
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:22,872
- Miss Kate, I hate to tell you this...
- Tell me, tell me.

466
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:27,954
Something evil following us.
Has been following us for days.

467
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:31,874
Something covered with, um... hair.

468
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,748
The Indian scalps.

469
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,832
That packhorse with
those damn fur pelts.

470
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,957
Right! An evil combination.

471
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,110
The spirit of the dead Kiowas...

472
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,636
and the zodiac
configuration of the stars.

473
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:52,029
What do you mean?

474
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,156
Look.

475
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:59,712
Jupiter moving in on Pluto.
Disaster. Death. A man killed.

476
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,758
- Mr Howie.
- Jim?

477
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:06,116
Listen, I've read the stars. I
didn't see all that happening.

478
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,919
- But where did you look?
- Right here. Page...

479
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,195
Oh, Miss Kate!

480
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,512
I mean here. Pisces, Libra, Capricorn.

481
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,910
And here. Those furs...

482
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,798
and that man out there...

483
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:27,716
are the Scorpio satanic
configuration of death for Jim Howie.

484
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,792
And the stars never lie.

485
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:36,993
But Howie don't believe in all...
He don't believe in anything.

486
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,310
But we do.

487
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,516
And we know it's true.

488
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:44,068
Don't we?

489
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,469
Then it's up to us.

490
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,753
You.

491
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:51,434
Me? How?

492
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:57,235
Cut loose that packhorse.
Get rid of those evil furs.

493
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,831
Tonight.

494
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,394
I'll do it.

495
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:48,350
- Damn, that's good and vile.
- (neighs)

496
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:52,797
You think I'm going to give
up on those people, don't you?

497
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,871
Well, I ain't.

498
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:06,559
You got any ideas about
what we ought to do next?

499
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:16,195
Hell, you never have
no ideas about nothing.

500
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,469
Hey, get outta there!

501
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,435
You damn jughead. That's locoweed.

502
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:40,275
You'll run around like a coyote with his
guts hanging out. Let's see your mouth.

503
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:43,796
Open it up. Come on. Open it up.

504
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:50,832
If you ate any of that
stuff, we're both done for.

505
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:54,754
You'll be crazy in the
head and I'll be walking.

506
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:57,149
How do you feel?

507
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,038
Well, I might as well find out.

508
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:07,239
If you throw me I'll
know you had a bellyful.

509
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:10,596
Whoa, now. Whoa. Easy.

510
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:28,757
Well, I guess you're all right.

511
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:33,311
Now, will you bend down and
pick up my rifle? I'm tired.

512
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,432
By Cod, you have got an idea.

513
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:43,034
Get those other horses in here.

514
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,468
- Bring 'em up!
- Get 'em all in.

515
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,435
Whoa. Whoa!

516
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,951
What the...?

517
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:43,271
 Qu pasa con estos caballos?

518
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:08,631
(Kate) Howie! Howie!

519
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,115
What the hell is
wrong with them horses?

520
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,189
Get 'em out of the water!

521
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,195
(neighing)

522
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:15,591
Don't look at me like
that. It was your idea.

523
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:25,199
Dirty rotten Comanche trick!

524
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:57,229
- You gonna keep those skins?
- If I have to pack 'em on your back.

525
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:59,834
You're gonna have us
crawling on our bellies.

526
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:05,392
You don't shut up, I'm gonna kick your
backside right up to your shoulder blades.

527
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,278
(Lee) Can I say something, Mr Howie?

528
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,349
Wouldn't it make more sense just
to give the man his furs back?

529
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:17,159
Well, I'll be damned.

530
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,356
Now I've heard everything.

531
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:23,591
What in hell is this world coming to?

532
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:28,435
If you give that man his furs
back, he'll let you alone.

533
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,431
I know him, Mr Howie.

534
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,996
- You what?
- What?

535
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:38,390
I was with the Indians when
they took his furs from him.

536
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,994
All he wants is what's his.

537
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,469
Well, well, well, well.

538
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,839
I'm a curly-haired,
blue-eyed angel.

539
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:00,799
- And you're in with him.
- No, sir.

540
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:05,317
But I know him, Mr Howie. Let me go
talk to him. Maybe he'll listen to me.

541
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,789
Howie, listen to him.

542
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:14,359
Just how long you think you're
gonna stay alive? Look at your men.

543
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,638
Well?

544
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,359
Is that the way you want it?

545
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,197
Jed?

546
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,711
Well, Yancy?

547
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:48,309
I just want to get to Mexico. Alive.

548
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,789
It makes sense.

549
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:56,955
Four men we rode with... dead.

550
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:59,998
Loco'd our horses.

551
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,913
And you want me to give
him the furs? I don't care!

552
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:08,791
Hell, give him everything! Go ahead.
And I hope he blows your head off.

553
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:21,512
Hey! You want to give
him my whiskey, too?

554
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:26,276
Catch more flies with honey
than with vinegar, Mr Howie.

555
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:37,355
Jim Howie's boys...

556
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,356
are gonna quit.

557
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:45,797
Split the guts of five
United States marshals.

558
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:49,752
Took half the banks of Kansas.

559
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:53,993
Took a whole town
full of Chink miners.

560
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:59,556
And jumped more Indians than
the United States Cavalry.

561
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,917
And Jim Howie's boys are gonna quit.

562
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,991
For one man.

563
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:16,800
For one man.

564
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:21,434
Mr Bass!

565
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,637
Mr Bass, where are you?

566
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:27,314
Mr Bass. Speak to me.

567
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,555
Damn you, Joe Bass.

568
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:35,871
I wonder why I go to all this trouble.

569
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:41,114
Cetting myself abused by
that bloodthirsty Jim Howie.

570
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:46,593
And all for you and your measly furs,
you ill-mannered, unlettered oaf.

571
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,558
Mr Bass, speak up!

572
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:56,237
I know you're out there, sneaking around.
Who do you think you are? Daniel Boone?

573
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,596
What's the matter, Julius
Caesar? Get lost again?

574
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:06,037
Mr Bass, please. You ruin a man's
mortal insides when you do that.

575
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:08,998
What are you here for? To
help them people kill me?

576
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:13,198
They don't want to kill you any more.
They want you to stop killing them.

577
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,077
They'll leave your furs and go.

578
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:20,393
You lying, split-tongue African Comanche.
You think I'd trust anything you say?

579
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:23,517
I'd take the word of that
scalphunter before I'd believe you.

580
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,194
I'm telling the truth.
They've had enough.

581
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:29,272
Don't you lie to me no
more. I'll get my furs.

582
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,874
And you and them people
will be for the vultures.

583
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,188
(clink)

584
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,635
What you got there?

585
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,717
What you got there?

586
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,360
Cood drinking whiskey.

587
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:44,113
Mr Howie's own stock.

588
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:01,994
Thought you could maybe
use a drink about now.

589
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:06,270
You sure made your way with those
people. You got their whiskey.

590
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:11,434
You're doing their bushwhacking for 'em.
Sashaying along with that fancy woman.

591
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:16,310
Throw you in the pigpen and you'd
come out vice president of the hogs.

592
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:36,999
If Cod ever made better inventions than
a pretty woman or a bottle of whiskey,

593
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,640
I ain't heard of it.

594
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,874
Mr Bass.

595
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,793
Could I have a drink of that?

596
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:51,910
If I was to give you a drink of this whiskey,
it'd be like pouring it out on the sand.

597
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:58,396
Whiskey's a man's drink. And you ain't
no man. You ain't no part of a man.

598
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:02,393
You're a mealy-mouthed, shufflebutt
slave and you've picked a master.

599
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:06,075
So don't go asking to
take a drink with a man.

600
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:15,471
You think mighty well of
yourself, don't you, Joe Bass?

601
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:19,269
You know how long you would
last as a coloured man?

602
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,430
About one minute.

603
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:28,512
The trouble with all your fighting, Joe
Bass, is you don't know when you've won.

604
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:32,512
Go ahead. Kill us all.

605
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,476
Lee.

606
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:41,112
Tell 'em to move out
and leave my furs.

607
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,836
Joseph Lee.

608
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,480
Come back here.

609
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,474
Tell 'em from here.

610
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:12,912
Mr Howie!

611
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,195
Move out.

612
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,789
That's everybody.

613
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:37,231
Don't seem right, that
man doing an honest thing.

614
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:40,198
They just want to be rid of you.

615
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:45,994
Where are you going, Julius Caesar?

616
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,229
With them. Where I aim to.

617
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,550
- To Mexico.
- Wait a minute.

618
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:57,514
Walk on down there ahead of me.

619
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,831
Hold it there.

620
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,391
Tie her up.

621
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,594
Go on. Scat.

622
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:52,711
This one won't scalp any more Indians.

623
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,635
Look out!

624
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:13,872
I busted his skull! I've done it!

625
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,909
The old daddy wolf,
he done it. He done it.

626
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,355
Mr Howie.

627
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:22,589
OK.

628
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,750
- No.
- You killed my men,

629
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,592
and loco'd my horses.

630
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:37,831
And now... I gotta punish you.

631
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:42,835
I'm gonna take your hair, and peel your
pretty white hide one inch at a time.

632
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:46,310
Quit talking, you ugly
bastard, and do it.

633
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:50,835
I'm going to hear you cry,
and I'm going to hear you beg.

634
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:52,956
- No, Mr Howie.
- Get off of me.

635
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:57,556
- You don't have to kill him, Mr Howie.
- Boy, I'm gonna kill you too.

636
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,192
Now, my boy, you...
you put that knife down.

637
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:12,794
Cut him, Lee. Cut him!

638
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:19,518
Now, you listen to me.
Now, listen to me, my boy.

639
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,713
I won't lift his hair.

640
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:29,592
I won't sell you.

641
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:32,240
And I'll let you go on with me.

642
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,709
To Mexico.

643
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:42,348
- Now, drop that knife, boy.
- Don't listen to him.

644
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,720
You really don't want to kill a man.

645
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:51,600
Do you?

646
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:56,269
I mean, do you?

647
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,991
Now you're using your head, boy.

648
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,752
Lee!

649
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:33,311
Get it, Lee!

650
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,673
Yowee!

651
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:08,955
Joseph Lee, you did it!

652
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:11,998
By Cod and by thunder, you did it!

653
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:17,312
I couldn't be more proud
if you was my own grandpa.

654
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:50,869
Joseph Lee, you sure
deserve that drink.

655
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:55,479
Now untie me.

656
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:43,149
Ahh.

657
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:46,152
He's sure taking his own sweet time.

658
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:51,109
- You worrying about Jim Howie?
- Stick him, he bleeds like anybody else.

659
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:55,239
That may be true, only he's the
one gonna be doing all the sticking.

660
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:59,871
- Why isn't he back here by now?
- You think he'd aim at a man, then miss?

661
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,676
One man, no. But there
are two back there.

662
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,758
Joe Bass, you're
looking at a rich man.

663
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:33,391
I might just hire you and your
horse to take me to Mexico.

664
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,639
Isn't there anything
you want to say to me?

665
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:41,632
Like "Thank you, Mr Lee"?

666
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:47,196
- Go to hell.
- Don't you mean "Go to hell, Mr Lee"?

667
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,350
Oh, quit acting like a damn fool.

668
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:54,355
First time you had guts enough to fight,
you puff around like a pregnant squaw.

669
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:56,431
Now untie me.

670
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:11,593
What the hell are you doing, Lee?

671
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:22,475
Damn you, Lee, that's
my horse. Get off him.

672
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:33,435
Damn your hide, Lee.
What are you up to?

673
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:36,273
Sic transit gloria mundi.

674
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,715
"To the victor belong the spoils."

675
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:42,554
Now, wait a minute, Joseph
Lee. Now, just a minute.

676
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:44,392
Let's you and I palaver.

677
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:49,349
We've had some differences, but you
wouldn't leave a man alone in the desert.

678
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:52,750
All tied up, with the crawling snakes.

679
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:56,435
And the bloodthirsty buzzards.
And the hungry coyotes.

680
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:02,117
You wouldn't do that. Leave me
to die, all alone. Would you?

681
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:06,478
You're Joe Bass. You can move
mountains. You'll be all right.

682
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:09,597
Get off my horse, you son of a bitch!

683
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:13,151
You know something, Joe Bass?

684
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:18,712
You are the most stubborn, love-yourself
man that ever walked Cod's creation.

685
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:25,273
And somebody just naturally ought to
bust some sense into your hard-boned head.

686
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:51,029
Somebody ought to just naturally bust
some sense into my hard-boned head?

687
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,875
- You wanna try?
- (neighing)

688
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:57,278
Hey, you jughead! Come back here.

689
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:26,032
Yeah. I wanna try.

690
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:41,596
All right, Joseph Lee. Get 'em up.

691
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:45,797
Protect yourself.
Get your hands higher.

692
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,152
Ow!

693
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,392
Ow!

694
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,869
Indian fighting. Like it?

695
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:05,951
Let me help you.

696
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:27,999
Argh! Aaargh!

697
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:30,514
Can't see, can you?

698
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:36,590
Aaargh!

699
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:38,875
Aaaargh!

700
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:41,235
That ain't fair!

701
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,992
I'm gonna bust you
on the jaw for that.

702
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:57,231
"See the superiority of
the white-skinned race."

703
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:02,637
"You're a mealy-mouthed,
shufflebutt slave."

704
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:13,110
Whoa! Whoa!

705
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:35,392
Damn you, Jim Howie. What the hell was
so important about a bunch of lousy furs?

706
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:37,630
Kate.

707
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:39,870
Over there.

708
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,592
Time.

709
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:34,471
Wait a minute. I hear something.

710
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:52,437
Wait a minute. I really
do hear something.

711
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:35,913
What the hell. They're only men.

712
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:45,871
Indian man.

713
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:49,077
I don't know how many
wives you got now,

714
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:54,632
but you're gonna have the damnedest
white squaw in the Kiowa nation.

715
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:15,399
You black Comanche!

716
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:20,471
Where are you?

717
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:33,478
(speaks Kiowa)

718
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:36,472
Two Crows! Ain't you dead?

719
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,718
(Joe speaks Kiowa)

720
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:54,477
I'm sure glad to see you, Two Crows.

721
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:59,036
Hey, wait a minute. Them's my furs.

722
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:02,069
(speaks Kiowa)

723
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:12,710
Cood hunting, Joe Bass.

724
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:19,597
Hey, wait a minute!

725
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:22,558
Wait a minute. Wait. Hold it.

726
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:26,670
You dirty redskins!

727
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:01,358
You know something?

728
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:05,638
There's two cases of
whiskey on that wagon.

729
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:12,836
I'd say by tonight there's going
to be a lot of drunk Indians.
