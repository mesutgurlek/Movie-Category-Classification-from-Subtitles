00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:46,731
And the sheriff's here.

168
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:49,100
He wants to ask you
a few questions.

169
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,269
You don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

170
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,271
I'd be more than happy
to tell him to piss off.

171
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:59,344
I can talk.

172
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,750
Hey, Branch.

173
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:09,754
I don't want to take
too much of your time.

174
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:12,524
I just want to know if you
remember what happened.

175
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,028
I got shot.

176
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,330
Yeah. Twice.

177
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,132
When I first found you,

178
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,302
you told me you'd been shot
by a dead man.

179
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,437
What'd you mean
by that?

180
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,776
David Ridges.

181
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:35,213
Barlow: Who the hell's
David Ridges?

182
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:38,983
The guy
from the suicide video?

183
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,486
Yeah.

184
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:46,090
Only he was wearing makeup...

185
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:49,060
Grayish white all over his face
and body,

186
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:50,962
like war paint.

187
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:59,237
And at some point
after he shot me,

188
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:02,473
he was standing over me,

189
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,510
chanting and dancing.

190
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,248
He had these black feathers
on his head.

191
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,252
You remember
firing your weapon?

192
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,291
I think so.

193
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,093
That's my boy.

194
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,863
I hope you hit
the Indian son of a bitch.

195
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,137
I just remembered
Nighthorse.

196
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,907
Jacob Nighthorse?

197
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:42,280
I was out at the funeral pyre
earlier with him.

198
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:46,951
I wanted to collect
some DNA evidence.

199
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:50,922
Jacob said if I went back,
someone would come after me.

200
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:55,360
So, that Nighthorse got
this guy Ridges to shoot you?

201
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,528
David Ridges is dead.

202
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,300
I saw him, Walt.

203
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:09,374
Before I got shot, I collected
some of the ashes.

204
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:12,510
Did you pick up the evidence bag
that I had?

205
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:16,147
I was kind of focused
on getting you help, so...

206
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:19,517
You got to get
that bag, Walt.

207
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,388
Those ashes...
They're not David's.

208
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,224
[ Breathing heavily ]

209
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,929
I'm not crazy.

210
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:46,444
Doc. What kind of meds
you have Branch on?

211
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:51,215
Uh, antibiotics to fight
infection, coagulant, dilantin.

212
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:52,917
I need you to do me
a favor.

213
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,252
I want you to run a test,

214
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:56,454
see if he's got anything else
in his system.

215
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,289
What do you want me
to check for?

216
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:02,126
Something that might explain
hallucinations.

217
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:08,366
[ Whistle blows ]

218
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:09,934
Man:
Right here. Move your feet.

219
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:11,302
There you go. There you go.
Yeah!

220
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,670
Yeah!

221
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:15,006
Watch the back door.
Watch the back door.

222
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,908
Yeah! Yeah!

223
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,277
[ Indistinct shouting ]

225
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,617
Hey, Jeff.

226
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:29,287
Better luck next time,
brother.

227
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:30,989
Yeah. See you next year.
See you next year. Okay.

228
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,260
Hey, sheriff.

229
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:37,662
Jacob.

230
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,431
So, uh, I take it your visit
is about Henry.

231
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:43,134
He never showed.
His team almost forfeited.

232
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,570
I'm sure they appreciated
you helping out.

233
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:47,038
I know Henry did.

234
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,240
So, where is he?
That's not your concern.

235
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:51,109
Right now,
I need to talk to you

236
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:53,311
about a conversation you had
with Branch.

237
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:58,449
Oh, right, the, uh...
The David Ridges thing.

238
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,219
Look, I know that, uh,
what I did

239
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:04,222
might fall slightly outside
your laws,

240
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:07,959
but all I was doing
was honoring David's wishes.

241
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:10,728
By burning his body
on a raised platform?

242
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,265
That's not exactly
a traditional Cheyenne burial.

243
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:17,535
David honored traditions
from many tribes.

244
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,238
Branch said
you threatened him.

245
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,373
Said if he tried to collect

246
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,276
any of David's ashes
to test them,

247
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:28,479
you would come after him.

248
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:31,449
I warned him

249
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:34,385
that the fury
of the Cheyenne nation

250
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,220
would come down on him.

251
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:39,690
I was speaking
about spirits,

252
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:43,995
of course...
About bad fortune.

253
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:47,165
Branch was shot
three hours ago.

254
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,700
He went back out

255
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:54,238
to where you told him not to go,
and he got shot.

256
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,278
And you think
I did it?

257
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,380
Did you?

258
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:03,848
No.

259
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,385
And if you need an alibi,

260
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:10,154
I was at a chamber
of commerce meeting.

261
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,656
What about David Ridges?

262
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:13,758
Oh, I'd say David's got
an even better alibi,

263
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,792
given that he's dead.

264
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:17,128
Not according to Branch.

265
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,597
Branch saw him
out there.

266
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,568
He saw David?

267
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:31,676
What did he say
David looked like?

268
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:37,348
He was wearing white makeup
on his face and body.

269
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:43,154
A white warrior.

270
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,858
Oh.

271
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,364
Are you
a religious man, Walt?

272
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,867
I'm a private man.

273
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,803
I didn't realize

274
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:03,674
how weak my own belief was
until now.

275
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,646
I saw David dead.

276
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,682
I burned his body.

277
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:15,553
And he came back.

278
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:18,422
He traveled through time.

279
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:27,198
Does anyone else know
about Branch's vision?

280
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,865
Why?

281
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,333
If people hear about it,

282
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,569
they're gonna want
to visit the site.

283
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:35,640
It's a sacred place.

284
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:40,278
It's also a crime scene.

285
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,913
So keep it to yourself.

286
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,316
Vic: You believe
in that kind of stuff?

287
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:46,584
Ask me later after I find

288
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,553
that bag of ashes
Branch left out there

289
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:51,822
and get it analyzed.

290
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:54,458
Mathias and his Denver buddies
were messy.

291
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,428

Didn't they beat buffalo
in '92?

298
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:18,416
Right. Right, but that was
for the '91 season, so...

299
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,418

I'm really sorry
about your wife.

No one should have to go through
that kind of thing alone.

303
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:44,475
Why didn't you tell anyone?

304
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:47,411
It must've been hell
keeping all that inside.

305
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,349
Was.

306
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,922
Letting it out doesn't feel
much better, so...

307
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,960
Know any good lawyers
for 1,200 bucks?

308
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:05,630
Not any good ones.

309
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:07,198
If we can't afford
a good lawyer,

310
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,532
we're gonna need
a good witness.

311

I need you to get

312

to the cumberland county
sheriff's office.

blows away, so...

your truck.

Can you confirm
that Jacob Nighthorse

00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:19,115
Walt, this is insane.
He needs to be in bed.

654
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:21,351
I don't really have
a choice.

655
00:40:21,353 --> 00:40:23,586
Mathias won't let me
detain anyone

656
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,688
without a solid
eyewitness I.D.

657
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,358
I'm not getting
any names or addresses.

658
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,094
I let them go now,
we'll never find them again.

659
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:36,733
Walt: You all right?
He's sweating pretty bad.

660
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:38,701
I'm fine.

661
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:41,070
You take
a good look.

662
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:42,839
You let us know
if one of these guys

663
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:44,140
is the guy
that shot you.

664
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,494
He's not here.

665
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:06,796
Take another look.

666
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:09,799
I know it was Ridges, Walt.

667
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:15,505
Sorry for the inconvenience,
gentlemen.

668
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:18,475
Mathias, wait.
You can't let them go.

669
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:20,009
I can and I am.

670
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:21,444
Mathias, what the hell?

671
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:22,645
Just wait a minute!

672
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:29,185
Take another look.
Take your time.

673
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:33,022
I know it was Ridges, Walt.

674
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:13,963
Dr. Weston analyzed those ashes
you were collecting.

675
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,836
Guess whose DNA
was in there.

676
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:21,938
Dave Ridges.

677
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:29,979
I know what I saw.

678
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:32,115
[ Paper rustles ]

679
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,293
[ Sighs ]

680
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,134
I wanted to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

681
00:42:51,136 --> 00:42:55,138
I wanted to come out here,
examine the crime scene...

682
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,673
Chase down every lead,

683
00:42:56,675 --> 00:43:01,044
but... he's dead, Branch.

684
00:43:01,046 --> 00:43:03,813
David Ridges is dead.

685
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:06,115
You imagined him.

686
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,688
So, if you were shot
by a white warrior,

687
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:15,024
you probably
just let him go.
