1
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,516
Sampson, come on, get up.
Get up, boy. Come on, Sampson, get up.

2
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,271
Sampson, come on now. Get up.
Get up, Sampson.

3
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,276
Daniel, where were you?
Your father's fit to be tied.

4
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,391
There was a horseless carriage.

5
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,636
I knew it was something like that.

6
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,991
You and your flights of fancy!.
What will we do with you?

7
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,716
We haVe enough to worry about,
what with all that's happening in town.

8
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,595
- Where's Pa?
- In the barn, tending to Sampson.

9
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,153
Sorry, Pa.

10
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,869
Sorry ain't good enough.

11
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,877
Just lucky Sampson didn't break a leg.

12
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,437
Pa, there was a horseless carriage
right here in Paradise Valley.

13
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,310
This is a farm! Work's got to be
done when it's supposed to be done!

14
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,875
- I hate the farm.
- What was that?

15
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,992
I hate the farm!
I wish you'd sell it. I hate it!

16
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,432
- You don't know what you're saying.
- Yes, I do.

17
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,792
It's nothing. It's just a dried-up,
miserable piece of ground!

18
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,911
You hold your tongue!

19
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,749
There's wood needs splitting.
You go on. Get to it. Go on!

20
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,319
A man works and slaVes to giVe
his son something worth haVing,

21
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,432
and he throws it back
like it don't mean beans!

22
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,756
He's just a boy, Jonas.

23
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,712
He's 12 years old.

24
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,874
Sun will be setting soon.

25
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,670
Trout will be near starving.

26
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,308
I eVer tell you about the time
Pecos Bill wrestled John Henry

27
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,636
at the Upside Down Mountain?

28
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,274
At least 100 times, Pa.

29
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,436
That many?

30
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,676
Well... What about that morning

31
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,158
Pecos Bill spiked Paul Bunyan's
flapjacks with hot chilli peppers?

32
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,511
Bunyan's breath
came spurting out like fire.

33
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,792
Burned down an entire Arizona territory.

34
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,870
I reckon I told you that one, too.

35
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,868
What about the time old Pecos Bill
took on, single-handed,

36
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,993
50 of the toughest, meanest outlaws
this side of the Rockies?

37
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,631
A person would haVe to be a fool
to take on 50 men.

38
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,035
Them 50 Varmints slapped leather,

39
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,879
but before you could say,
"Pass the peas",

40
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,674
Pecos Bill emptied
both his six-shooters.

41
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,509
- Shot off their trigger fingers.
- Their trigger fingers?

42
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,553
It was Sunday.
Pecos neVer killed on a Sunday.

43
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,950
- Pa, it's just a tall tale.
- That don't mean it ain't true.

44
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,957
- It's crazy talk.
- Then Pecos Bill swung his lariat,

45
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,232
roped a passing twister
and rode off into the sky.

46
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,718
- Pa, Pecos Bill ain't real.
- He's out there.

47
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,549
Where there's still enough
elbow room for a man to wander.

48
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,834
He's out there, where the land's
still young and wild.

49
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,552
You don't belieVe me.

50
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,030
I swear to you
by the Code of the West.

51
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,231
Pecos Bill is as real as you and me.

52
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,955
Now, you know the Code of the West,
don't you?

53
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,359
Yeah, Pa, I know.

54
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,314
Respect the land,
defend the defenceless,

55
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,479
and don't you neVer spit
in front of women and children.

56
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,633
Do you want me to bow down
and sell like the rest of 'em want to?

57
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,149
If it means staying aliVe, yes.

58
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,797
Why is it always you that's the hero,
you that sticks his neck out?

59
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,956
Because somebody's got to.

60
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,515
Jonas, no guns!

61
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,755
This isn't a story you tell to Daniel.

62
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,951
It ain't that bad.

63
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,073
You're so quick to risk your life.
What about your family?

64
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,713
What about us?

65
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,674
That's why I'm doing this.

66
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,153
I'll be back before you know it.

67
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,790
Be careful.

68
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,434
I'm selling. Stiles ain't a man
to take no for an answer.

69
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,679
He can't make us sell.
Not if we all stick together.

70
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,790
My pa was a farmer.

71
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,639
I know what it's like to work the land

72
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,274
till your hands are blistered and raw,

73
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,313
hoping the weather won't turn bad,

74
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,957
praying the crop'll come in,
hanging on when it don't.

75
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,116
Oh, yeah...

76
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,754
I know what it's like to be a farmer.

77
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,359
And I got out.

78
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,993
Hallelujah!

79
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,310
Now I'm giVing you all the same
chance I made for myself.

80
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,272
A way out.

81
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,152
50 dollars an acre.

82
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,035
Cold cash. With that kind
of pocket change, my friends,

83
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,357
you can buy yourselVes
a nice new house in town.

84
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,438
Fill it with all the modern conVeniences.

85
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,392
Industry makes them things.

86
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,195
Factories going round the clock.
Oil wells to power 'em.

87
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,789
- That's the future!
- And then what?

88
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,718
And who might you be, friend?

89
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,430
The name's Jonas Hackett.
And you ain't no friend of mine.

90
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,439
What happens after Mr Stiles
and his partners from back east

91
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,792
are all done tearing and ripping
apart Paradise Valley

92
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,195
just like he did in GraVity Valley?

93
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,678
I'll tell you what happens.
Jefferson County will be next.

94
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,112
But, Jonas, 50 dollars an acre!

95
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,312
That's a lot of money.
No question about it.

96
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,352
This is the deed to my farm.
My farm!

97
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,239
It's got my sweat in it.
My blood, too.

98
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,474
It's where my children were born...

99
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,837
..where my father's buried
and it's where I want to be buried, too.

100
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:05,068
That's worth a lot more to me
than 50 dollars an acre.

101
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,675
It's worth a lot more to me
than any price.

102
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,916
I ain't selling.

103
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,430
Goodnight, Jonas.

104
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,039
- Daniel?
- Howdy, Pa!

105
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,995
- I just heard you and Ma.
- Be quiet and listen to me!

106
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,348
Take this deed. Take it and don't
let anybody haVe it, no matter what!

107
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,949
- Pa...
- No matter what! Understand?

108
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,631
Now go! Go on!

109
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,349
- Pa, listen!
- Go, blast you! Go!

110
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,990
- He don't haVe it.
- The deed. Where is it?

111
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,589
I told you. I ain't selling.

112
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,997
Don't play games with me!
You had it at the meeting.

113
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,518
The kid!
He must haVe giVe it to the kid.

114
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,634
Find the brat. If he giVes you
any trouble, kill him.

115
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,831
Pa!

116
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,950
I'Ve done all I can do.
It's in the Lord's hands now.

117
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,232
Jonas is tough.
He'll pull through.

118
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,718
I'll tell you one thing.
I'm selling. Pulling out.

119
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,196
No piece of ground is worth dying oVer.

120
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,074
Where am l?

121
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,716
Stick 'em up!
Hands aboVe your head. Now!

122
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,311
Zeb, search him.

123
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,478
Search him!

124
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,588
- Get out of this boat, boy!
- Hands aboVe your head!

125
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,592
- What haVe we got here?
- That's mine! GiVe it back!

126
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,951
- That's his. He wants it back!
- Hands up!

127
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,112
I hear some jingle!

128
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,436
We got 16 cents. Hot spit.

129
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,680
Any gold in his teeth?

130
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,836
Open that mouth, boy.

131
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,996
Open it.

132
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,829
I count one... Wider!

133
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,430
Two... Four fillings.

134
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,234
Somebody ain't been brushing!

135
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,196
Grub...

136
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,595
Let me kill this one.

137
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,675
You killed the last two in a row.

138
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,348
That's 'cause I'm better at it than you.

139
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,872
What's fair is fair! How am I gonna
get good at it if I don't practise?

140
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,995
All right. Go ahead.

141
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,758
No!

142
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,639
Should I shoot him
right between the eyes?

143
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,753
So long, kid. Sorry to stunt
your growth!

144
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,110
Now, don't you moVe!

145
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,155
My trigger finger!

146
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,352
Somebody done shot off
my trigger finger!

147
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,349
- Who are you?
- I'm a ring-tailed roarer.

148
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,917
I draw faster, shoot straighter
and drink longer than any man aliVe.

149
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,873
- I ride cyclones...
- Got a name, don't you?

150
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,277
I'm getting to that.
I am the rip-snortingest cowboy

151
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,234
that eVer rode north, south,
east or west of the Rio Grande.

152
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,192
I'm Pecos Bill.

153
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,439
- And I'm Santa Claus!
- Friendly cuss, huh, Widowmaker?

154
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,075
My name's Daniel Hackett.

155
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,236
Well, Dannel Hackett,

156
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,638
I belieVe them Varmints
got something that belongs to you.

157
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,869
Come on, mister. Let us go.
We was only fooling!

158
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,597
We wasn't gonna hurt the boy.

159
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,997
Just one bullet.
That's all it would haVe been.

160
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,556
I ought to plug you two right now,

161
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,035
but I neVer kill a man on Sunday.

162
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,196
But today's Wednesday.

163
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,799
Wednesday?

164
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,475
Please don't kill poor harmless
old bandits like us!

165
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,915
So where you headed, Dannel Hackett?

166
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,475
- Where am l?
- Texas.

167
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,593
- Texas?
- Where did you think you was?

168
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,759
I don't know. All I remember is
falling asleep in Paradise Valley.

169
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,951
My boat must haVe gotten loose.

170
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,152
Drifted all the way down
from Paradise Valley?

171
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,238
I can't explain it, but it's the truth.

172
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,113
Where are you going?

173
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,912
South, down Mexico way.

174
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,876
Mister, I gotta get home.

175
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,119
My pa's bad hurt. I gotta take care
of my ma and my little brother.

176
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,108
You stay here and you're gonna fry
like a bug on a hot skillet.

177
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,117
You best come with me.

178
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,233
Put some muscle into it!

179
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,273
Paradise Valley. My idea of heaVen!

180
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,880
Iron, coal, oil, copper.

181
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,756
Riches beyond the imagination, just
waiting for a few rugged indiViduals

182
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,952
with the Vision, the strength
and the means

183
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,310
to make their dreams come true.

184
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,671
Gentlemen, we stand
on the edge of history.

185
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,270
- What about the deeds?
- We'll haVe them tonight.

186
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,916
- You still don't haVe the deeds?
- It's under control.

187
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,069
What happens if we finish the tunnel
and the farmers still haVen't sold?

188
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,272
This is the West.
Things are simple here.

189
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,155
There's only one law -
winner take all.

190
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,316
And I plan to take it.

191
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:13,435
You best be right, otherwise
you'll end up back where you started -

192
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,596
just another gun for hire.

193
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,988
By the time that tunnel
breaks through, I guarantee you,

194
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,193
we will haVe the deeds
to eVery inch of Paradise Valley...

195
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,109
..one way or another.

196
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,314
Whoa, Widowmaker.
We'll make camp here.

197
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,596
Good boy, Widowmaker.

198
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,796
Whoa, Widowmaker. Easy, son.

199
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,755
Widowmaker's kinda particular about
folks taking liberties with him.

200
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,317
Last man who tried that,

201
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,275
Widowmaker kicked him so hard
he ended up halfway to the moon.

202
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,516
Name of Lanky Hank.

203
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,679
He bounced up and down
for a month of Sundays until finally

204
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,759
I just had to shoot him down
so he could haVe a proper burial.

205
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,317
The moon's thousands of miles away.
A man could neVer bounce that high.

206
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,557
You sure do know a lot
for a half-growed piglet.

207
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,958
In plain English, stay away
from the horse or he'll kill you.

208
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,592
- I'll try to remember that.
- See that you do.

209
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,431
Kinda makes it all worthwhile,
don't it?

210
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,312
- I ain't going to Mexico.
- Who said anything about Mexico?

211
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,954
We're headed north.

212
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,117
- Paradise Valley?
- You got business to settle.

213
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,398
But why? Why would
you go out of your way for me?

214
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,676
Are you coming or ain't you?

215
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,278
Hackett's farm, right smack
in the middle of eVerything!

216
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,916
Without that deed,
I won't haVe a bucket to spit in.

217
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,997
Well?

218
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,151
Hackett's kid's disappeared.
And the deed with him.

219
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,350
In other words, you let him get away?

220
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,516
Me?

221
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,156
No. The kid got hold of a boat
and he slipped down south.

222
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,032
I want that kid!

223
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,516
I ain't looking for a fight with Stiles.
I just wanna get home.

224
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,190
Sometimes a fight comes looking for you.

225
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,233
Finds you, too,
no matter where you hide.

226
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,638
It would be 100 to one.
Nobody can win against those odds.

227
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,592
100 to one?

228
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,349
Job like this calls for a big man -
Mr Paul Bunyan.

229
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,516
Paul Bunyan? Yeah, right!

230
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,672
Bunyan?

231
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,429
- NeVer heard of him.
- That's 'cause he don't exist!

232
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,918
You ain't heard of Paul Bunyan,
the greatest logger of 'em all?

233
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,076
No.

234
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,356
Come on. Let's haul freight
out of this manure wagon.

235
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,680
Come here!

236
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,715
I hear that you're looking for Big Paul?

237
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:24,233
- You know Paul Bunyan?
- Know him? By cracky, yeah!

238
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,955
I'Ve flipped more flapjacks
and slung more hash

239
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,515
than you can shake a fist at,

240
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,871
trying to fill the belly of that fella!

241
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,436
- I neVer could, you know?
- Do you know where he might be?

242
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:44,591
Paul pulled up stakes when
the first machinery moVed in here.

243
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:51,239
The last I heard, he'd settled
in the Great Redwood Forest.

244
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,000
Well, I'm much obliged to you,
old fella.

245
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,111
Appreciate it.

246
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,152
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck to you.

247
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,919
He's just an old geezer.
What does he know?

248
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,156
More than you.

249
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,799
Howdy.

250
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,471
We'll take that deed, kid!

251
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,636
Pecos!

252
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,753
- Pecos!
- Hang on, Dannel!

253
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,197
Help!

254
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,553
Pecos!

255
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:40,555
Let's go, kid. This way.
We gotta get you out of here.

256
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,030
All right now, come on out.

257
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,758
Attaboy, Widowmaker!

258
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,511
Get the hell outta here!
Go down the pipe and keep going.

259
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,836
Say hi to Big Paul, and good luck!

260
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,675
- Get back here, kid!
- What are you waiting for? Jump!

261
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,229
What I can't understand is
how did they know we was coming?

262
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,318
- Maybe the telegraph.
- The what?

263
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,318
They're strings of wire which allow
a man, say in San Francisco,

264
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,592
to talk to a man in New York City.

265
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,759
You're telling me a tall tale!
No Voice can carry that far!

266
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,428
They don't actually talk to each other,

267
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,108
but word has it that that's coming, too.

268
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,916
This man named Bell is claiming that
people can be hundreds of miles away

269
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,874
and hold a conVersation like
they're as close as I am to you!

270
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,117
EVerybody'll know eVerybody else's
business?

271
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,677
There ain't gonna be a single place
left a man could find any priVacy.

272
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,155
I'll tell you about eVerybody -

273
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,035
eVerybody and their dog's
probably after us by now!

274
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,919
It used to be when a man got
a head start, it meant something!

275
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,236
Least we got away.

276
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,435
NeVer enough for you termites, is it?
You swindled me out of my camp,

277
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,916
robbed me of my trade,
now you want my woods, too!

278
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,433
I'm making my stand!

279
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,076
At least if I go down swinging,
I go down like a man!

280
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,953
Hush up, you log brain!

281
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,356
Pecos?

282
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,552
Let me take a gander at you.

283
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,469
You steamin' pile of buffalo pucky.
You're still ugly!

284
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,437
I told Sam.

285
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,359
They're not loggers. They're butchers.

286
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,199
Fancy machines cuttin' down eVerything,

287
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,152
the weak with the strong,

288
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,990
the sapling with the full-growed
so nothing could eVer sprout again.

289
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,555
Sam said I was behind the times.

290
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,153
Me! Paul Bunyan.
The man who inVented logging!

291
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,432
Who thought up
the double-bladed axe? Me.

292
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,551
Who dreamed up the log flume?

293
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,754
Me again. It ain't easy. My head
hurt for days thinking up that one.

294
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,272
What about the grindstone?
Flapjack contest, wedge cuttin',

295
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,597
three point stands? Me, me, me, me!

296
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,315
Maybe I'm just old-fashioned,

297
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:21,152
but in my day, we didn't kill
the land, we just borrowed from it.

298
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:25,239
- What are you gonna do about it?
- I'll do as I darn well please.

299
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,230
- The rest can go to the blazes!
- lncluding Paradise Valley?

300
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,350
Paradise Valley? No concern of mine.

301
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,028
You're not Paul Bunyan.

302
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,233
Who says I ain't?

303
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,716
My pa told me stories about Paul Bunyan.

304
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,357
He said that Paul Bunyan was a giant
of a man. He could tame a continent.

305
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,757
Look danger in the eyes
and laugh in its face.

306
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,791
He got those parts right.

307
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,752
Not from where I'm sitting.

308
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,397
Seems to me you're just hiding out,
feeling sorry for yourself.

309
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,599
Pecos, who is this kid?

310
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,156
Seems to me
that you're just plain scared.

311
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,429
You are not the Paul Bunyan
my pa was telling me about.

312
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,793
How old are you, kid?

313
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,153
12.

314
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,716
Do me a big, sequoia-sized faVour.

315
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,115
Stay out of my way if you wanna be 13.

316
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,196
Is that ox really blue?

317
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,837
Of course he is. He was born
during the winter of the blue snow.

318
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,156
MoVe it, Pecos.

319
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,635
- He's feeling frisky.
- You moVe it!

320
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,435
Big blue bag of beef oughta be
haulin' logs, not haulin' ass.

321
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,993
Pardon my French.

322
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,397
Don't you worry, pretty baby.
Papa's here.

323
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,636
He won't let the bad man hurt you.

324
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,230
Watch your mouth, Pecos!
Baby's Very sensitiVe!

325
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,678
We'll catch the ferry at Liberty City.

326
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,078
Home to eVery horse thief
and con artist in the territory!

327
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,076
Who will try his hand against the
latest miracle of modern technology?

328
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,197
I'm offering ten to one odds

329
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,838
that this new machine can driVe
steel faster than anyone aliVe.

330
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,319
Now, come on! There's gotta be
someone here man enough to try!

331
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:59,150
You, sir? Come on! There's gotta be
someone man enough to try!

332
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,513
My name's John Henry.

333
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,190
And, mister, you got yourself a bet!

334
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,953
I'm offering 12 to one
the machine wins.

335
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,875
It'd be a sucker's bet at 20 to one!

336
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,834
$100 eVen money says he whips
that gol' dang contraption!

337
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,390
EVen money, Pecos?
You can do better than that!

338
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,957
That thingumajigger
looks like it means business.

339
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,559
We'll see.

340
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,392
- You ready?
- I'm missing my shaker.

341
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,479
- Can't driVe steel without one.
- Who'll hold for this man?

342
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,240
And be squashed like a tin can
by his hammer?

343
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,477
There ain't nobody that dim-witted!

344
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,671
Somebody's gotta haVe the gumption!

345
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,836
You can forget about it!

346
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,031
Widowmaker!

347
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,118
- Pecos!
- Sorry, Dannel.

348
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,675
I gotta protect my inVestment!

349
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,356
That's a braVe boy!

350
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,031
How about a round of applause
for this courageous young lad?

351
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,595
May the Lord haVe mercy on his soul!

352
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,836
Mister...

353
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,917
I can't do it.

354
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:33,113
You don't know what you can do
until you try. Come on.

355
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,994
Come on, boy.

356
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,118
GiVe this drill a shake and a turn
after each time I hit it.

357
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,032
- What if you miss it?
- I neVer miss.

358
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:59,234
- Leastwise, I haVen't yet. Ready!
- Ready!

359
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,073
Come on!

360
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,513
Four-foot jumper, son.
Make it snappy!

361
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,916
Come on, John Henry!

362
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:26,511
Paul Bunyan! As I liVe and breathe!

363
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,553
LiVe and breathe later!
You got a race to win!

364
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,950
Time to get serious. Come on!

365
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,558
This 20-pound hammer

366
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,989
Shine like silver

367
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,950
Shine like silver

368
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,754
But it ring like gold...

369
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,311
Six-foot jumper, son. Go! Hurry!

370
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,073
Hurry, boy! Hurry!

371
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,033
- I can't do it!
- Come on!

372
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,673
- They're too far ahead!
- Come on!

373
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,075
Come on, son! Come on!

374
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,114
Get up, Dannel! Get up, boy!

375
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,035
The machine wins!

376
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,952
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you
for your time and your money!

377
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,069
- I'm sorry.
- You gaVe it your best shot.

378
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,993
If you gaVe it your best shot,
you ain't got nothing to be sorry for.

379
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,991
Go ahead, Widowmaker, might as well
get your licks in, too!

380
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,637
Looks like the boy's been through here.

381
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,310
Hey! Look at this.

382
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,875
Somebody's finger.

383
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,393
Somebody's trigger finger.

384
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,635
My record was perfect before today.

385
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:29,118
Now you are foreVer tarnished
with ignominious defeat.

386
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:35,034
- Come on, fellas. He's just a kid.
- He's bad news, Bill. In britches.

387
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,196
He ain't that...

388
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,480
- What is it?
- Sarsaparilla.

389
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,157
- To the Code.
- To the Code.

390
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,318
What do you know about the Code?

391
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,239
Plenty. My pa is always going on
about it.

392
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,069
Knowing about the Code
ain't the same as liVing by it.

393
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,589
Good enough.
To the Code of the West.

394
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,314
- Code of the North.
- The Code of the South.

395
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,350
Respect the land,
defend the defenceless,

396
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,677
and don't neVer spit
in front of women and children.

397
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,631
You just stepped oVer the line, boy!

398
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:25,674
Well, howdy, friend.
How 'bout me buying you a drink?

399
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,668
Sure. Just as soon as I'm done
skinnin' this marmot.

400
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,632
Holler if you need a hand!

401
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,718
This little saddle sore
ain't worth your time.

402
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,356
- I'll be the judge of that.
- I'd take that drink if I was you.

403
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,917
- So, what are you drinking?
- Whisky.

404
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,758
Jasper, let me haVe some whisky.

405
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,550
Shucks.

406
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,389
Gentlemen, to Texas!

407
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,831
The nearest thing to heaVen
on God's green earth.

408
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,479
You from Texas?

409
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,397
I do haVe that honour, sir.

410
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,353
I thought I smelled something funny
in here.

411
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,469
Easy. Can't scrap
on an empty stomach, you know that.

412
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,356
Mister, are you insulting
the great state of Texas?

413
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,836
The great state of two-bit tinhorns,
you mean?

414
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,348
Mister, you can insult me

415
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,994
and you can insult my friends.

416
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:57,955
As a matter of fact, you can eVen
insult my mother and my horse.

417
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,675
But don't you eVer insult
the great state of Texas.

418
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,710
You eVen hit like a Texan!

419
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,309
All right. Party's oVer.

420
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,199
Anybody else?

421
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,757
Anybody make a moVe
and I'll fill 'em full of lead,

422
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,916
or my name ain't Calamity Jane!

423
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,273
Jasper...

424
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,153
..who started this confabulation?

425
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,190
Them two.

426
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,631
Where did that other one get to?

427
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:48,438
Well, paint my toenails and curl my hair!

428
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,596
Calamity?

429
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,791
My cactus flower!

430
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:58,348
Don't cactus flower me,
you double-crossing dog!

431
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,870
I missed you, darlin'.
If only you knew how much!

432
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,072
I know too well,
you flea-infested little weasel!

433
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,553
Calamity, you look
mighty pretty tonight.

434
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,877
Sweet talking me?
You oVergrown, mealy-mouthed,

435
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,877
two-faced sniVellin' snake!

436
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,919
You gutless, brainless,
heartless sidewinder!

437
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,112
You ain't still sore about Amarillo,
are you?

438
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,880
You had to bring up Amarillo?

439
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,868
What's she got agin you anyway,
Pecos?

440
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,674
I run out on her.

441
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,679
Now, Bill, why would you wanna go
and do something like that?

442
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:06,351
Calamity's a mighty handsome woman,
Pecos.

443
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,753
Oh, I know.

444
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,199
Well, in her own way.

445
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,592
Buy me a drink, big boy?

446
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,756
Maybe some other time.

447
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,679
What's the matter?
Is it past your bedtime?

448
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,109
The kid ran away faster
than a scared rabbit.

449
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:23,995
Amen and good riddance.
He bothered me.

450
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:28,557
Why shouldn't he run? You been agin
that boy since you set eyes on him!

451
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,349
It's Dannel!

452
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,554
Ox! Baby!

453
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,070
How does it feel to be on the wrong
side of the law?

454
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,999
Fine, as long
as my ma don't find out.

455
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,555
I didn't know you had it in you!

456
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,671
That's my ox!

457
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,077
- What's that noise?
- It's coming this way.

458
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,833
Faster, you dumb ox!

459
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,435
- Ox!
- Run, Daniel! Run, boy!

460
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,990
Come back, you lily-liVered cowards!

461
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,830
Stupid ox! Why ain't he pullin', Paul?

462
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,070
Why did he quit pullin', Paul?

463
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,396
It's Very simple. If you insulted him,
you haVe to apologise.

464
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,558
- Paul?
- Mr Pecos Bill.

465
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:55,069
I ain't apologising to no ox.

466
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:10,508
Babe, Uncle Pecos thinks you're
the prettiest blue ox he eVer did see,

467
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,597
and he is Very, Very sorry

468
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,110
for any hurtfulness he may haVe
caused you. Now pull!

469
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,598
Yeah! Go, baby!

470
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,396
- Yeah!
- Timber!

471
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:45,593
Spread out. If you find the boy,
head to the ferry.

472
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,195
Oh, dear!

473
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,479
Timber!

474
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,069
Take that, you pissants!
I'm Paul Bunyan!

475
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,750
I'm 300 pounds of raging fury!

476
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,914
You're in trouble now! Don't point
your gun at me, you sissy!

477
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:28,557
I can out-eat, out-swing
any one of you! I'm Paul Bunyan!

478
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,476
I got him!

479
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,636
Hold on, you little bandit!

480
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,312
GiVe me that deed!

481
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,960
Nobody's gonna hurt you, son.

482
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,915
Just hand oVer that deed.

483
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:08,636
- You shot Pa!
- Son, your pa's a fool.

484
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:12,435
He's stuck in the past and
he wants you stuck there with him.

485
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,791
That ain't what you want, is it?

486
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,356
You don't wanna waste your life
behind a plough!

487
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,236
You want more than that!

488
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,954
You hate that farm.

489
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:34,112
It ain't nothing but a dried-up,
miserable piece of ground! Now...

490
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,510
GiVe me that deed!

491
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,309
Son, you're trying my patience!

492
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,993
GiVe me that deed
like a good little boy!

493
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,477
Kid, trouble seems to follow you
like a bird dog.

494
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,636
Lucky for me I got my friends!

495
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,991
We ain't that good friends.
Get your carcass off me!

496
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,151
- MoVe it!
- You can't get away from me!

497
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,112
Get 'em!

498
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,510
Come on, boys!

499
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:40,952
Come on! Come on, Pecos!

500
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,355
Come on! Hurry up!

501
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,790
Timber!

502
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,120
This ain't oVer, kid!

503
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,470
Not by a long shot.

504
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,233
Thinking about your pa?

505
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,428
I used to bait a line with my daddy
when I was a young 'un.

506
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,349
NeVer caught much,
but that was neVer the point.

507
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:29,588
Seems like fishin's the only time
me and Pa actually get along.

508
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,552
You two lock horns, huh?

509
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,992
As far as Pa's concerned,

510
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,510
- I can't do nothing right.
- My daddy was the same way.

511
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:41,713
Always telling me what to do like
I didn't haVe no mind of my own.

512
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,876
Exactly.

513
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:49,074
Although I know I should haVe
finished the ploughing.

514
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:56,189
I now see he only bothered on
account of how much he cared for me.

515
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,473
Daddy was just doing the best
he knew how.

516
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,956
That's why it grieVes me

517
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:08,472
I neVer got the gumption
to tell him how I felt about him.

518
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,149
Why not?

519
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:16,352
Daddy got sold down riVer.

520
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,434
Sold?

521
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,154
We was slaVes.

522
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:30,197
It's too late for me.

523
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,755
Let's hope it's not too late for you.

524
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,189
First a blasted ox, now a jackass!

525
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,277
Might as well be riding turtles!

526
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:53,359
- Cold Molasses is a mule!
- I wasn't referring to her!

527
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,916
Shake a hoof! Come sun-up,
we hit the endless desert.

528
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:00,112
Meanest stretch
of desolation this side of hell.

529
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,353
- Sure is dark.
- Sure is.

530
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:11,352
I once seen a picture
of New York City at night.

531
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:15,872
It's all lit up with electric light bulbs.
We could use a few now.

532
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,959
- Electric light ball?
- Light bulbs. Balls of glass

533
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,072
which light up 100 times brighter
than a candle.

534
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:28,039
- Go on.
- Soon, people won't need lanterns.

535
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,629
Won't haVe to chop wood
to make fires.

536
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:34,435
You turn a knob and these electric
light bulbs just come on.

537
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,473
But I like chopping wood.

538
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,717
Pretty soon, there won't be
no darkness.

539
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,514
It'll be like noontime at midnight.

540
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,950
How are folks gonna see the stars?

541
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:50,948
They just won't see the stars, I guess.

542
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,949
Well, I don't like it. No siree bob.
I don't like it one...

543
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,072
If you ask me, I think he's telling
us a tall tale!

544
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:05,078
Yeah, that's a tall tale for sure.

545
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,110
It's the God's honest truth.

546
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,715
Not see the stars?

547
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,753
It's hotter than a June bride
in a feather bed.

548
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,272
This ain't nothing - not compared
to the summer of '88.

549
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:25,712
It was so hot that all the chickens
was laying fried eggs.

550
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:29,196
- Babies was crying sawdust.
- We're out of water!

551
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:33,757
Things got so bad that the whole
state of Texas lit on fire.

552
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,919
- I hightailed up to Kansas...
- Does this story haVe a point?

553
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:44,912
Or does it just go on and on and on
like this stinkin' desert?

554
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:49,830
Yeah, this story has a point.
I blew out the dang fire!

555
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:54,397
I'm tired of you complaining
and whining all the time!

556
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,068
I'm in the middle of a giant barbecue pit!

557
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,158
I don't know
what will kill me first - the heat,

558
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,272
the thirst,
or your incessant yammering!

559
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:08,554
Shut up! Shut up!
You oVerblown tub o' lard!

560
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:14,392
You stay out of this, you contest loser!
What did you call me?

561
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:20,994
Shut up! You're nothing
but a big fat tub! Quitter! Quitter!

562
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,670
Big fat quitter! Quitter!

563
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,356
Pa?

564
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:24,036
It's all right, Dannel. Just a mirage.

565
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,708
He was there.

566
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,074
It is amazing, the things
that heat'll do to a man.

567
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:44,078
I just wanna get home.

568
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,592
Things can't get no worse than this.

569
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:32,598
- Pecos!
- Good morning!

570
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:35,997
Early to bed, early to rise,

571
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:39,317
makes a boy healthy, wealthy...

572
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,913
..and aliVe!

573
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:49,711
- Touch him and you're dead!
- I got no quarrel with you.

574
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,399
Or your friends.

575
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,875
You got a peculiar way of showing it.

576
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:58,358
- The deed.
- You can't haVe the...

577
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,120
We don't haVe a prayer.

578
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,709
We neVer did.

579
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,718
If that's your way of thinking,
then we don't.

580
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,388
You don't stop progress, cowboy.

581
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:12,797
That's the difference
between me and you.

582
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,719
I can adjust to the times.
You can't.

583
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,196
- Don't listen to him, Daniel.
- We can beat this thing.

584
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,152
You just got to belieVe, boy.

585
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:29,517
Where do you get off
telling me what to do?

586
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:33,076
Where do any of you get off
telling people how to liVe?

587
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:36,909
- That's the spirit!
- Don't lose the dream.

588
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:40,317
You don't know
what you can do until you try.

589
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:45,799
You are all nothing! Just a bunch
of tall tales that my Pa made up!

590
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,712
And you are nothing but hot air.

591
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:57,272
I ain't got all day, boy.

592
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:01,710
Time is money.

593
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,230
Don't do it, Dannel.

594
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,675
I am a ring-tailed roarer.

595
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,917
I draw faster, shoot straighter...

596
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:30,511
This 20-pound hammer
Shine like silver!

597
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:33,712
I can out-eat, out-swing any man aliVe!

598
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,038
I just wanna get home!

599
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,276
I'm the rip-snortingest cowboy

600
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:44,598
that eVer rode north, south,
east or west of the Rio Grande.

601
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,756
I am Pecos Bill.

602
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,076
Pa?

603
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,836
Pa?

604
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,678
MoVe it!

605
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,950
No!

606
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,116
Ma!

607
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,992
Daniel!

608
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:06,875
I'm back! I made it back!

609
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,597
Your father, he's gonna be all right.

610
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:26,994
Pa?

611
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,679
Daniel.

612
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,475
Pa, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

613
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:37,037
It's all right. I knew you didn't
mean any of those things you said.

614
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,514
But I did, Pa.

615
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:42,759
I told Pecos you were stupid
for standing up like you done,

616
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,919
but I was the one who was being
stupid, Pa. I was being a fool.

617
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,588
- Pecos?
- Pecos Bill.

618
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,391
You had a talk with Pecos Bill?

619
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:58,036
Pecos Bill, Paul Bunyan
and John Henry were all there.

620
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,674
They were just like you said, Pa.

621
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,553
Well, now, where was this?

622
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:07,309
It was in the desert.
Redwood Forest, Liberty City.

623
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:11,149
- The Great CaVerns.
- You coVered a lot of territory.

624
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:15,239
We had to. Stiles and his gang
were on our tails the whole ways.

625
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,192
JP Stiles?

626
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:22,599
But it's OK,
because the deed's right here.

627
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,237
The Valley's still right here
and we still got a chance to saVe it.

628
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,590
Daniel...

629
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:38,269
- You don't belieVe me?
- You fell asleep on the boat.

630
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:42,314
But, Ma, they were there.
They was as real as you and me.

631
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,754
Pa, you belieVe me, don't you?

632
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,157
Yes, son. I belieVe you.

633
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:59,759
We still got the deed, Pa. I don't
know how, but we still got it,

634
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,349
and JP Stiles ain't getting this farm.

635
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,869
Son, you did fine. You did just fine.

636
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,791
Not that it matters any more.

637
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,631
Pa, it does! It does matter.
It matters all the world!

638
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:17,434
We're selling.

639
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:20,518
No piece of land is worth dying for.

640
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:23,757
I guess it's about time
you faced up to that, too.

641
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:26,599
You're giVing up?

642
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,756
Wisin' up.

643
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,193
No, Pa.

644
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,356
No, Pa. The land's defenceless!

645
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:41,193
Pa, if you giVe in, you don't know
what's gonna happen here!

646
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:45,234
Daniel, you heard your father.
Now let him rest.

647
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,715
Ma, somebody's got to do something!

648
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,036
Daniel, please.

649
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:16,159
Gentlemen, to your health.

650
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:44,479
The West, indeed!

651
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,788
That kid's blocking the tracks.

652
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,551
Well, I see your pa's sent
a boy to do a man's job!

653
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,752
I come on my own accord.

654
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:07,317
The time for deeds is oVer, kid.
Get off the track.

655
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:11,877
I'm telling you to get
out of Paradise Valley.

656
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,868
A little speck of dust like you.

657
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,514
You really think you can stop all this?

658
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:23,155
Well, maybe not, but I sure
am gonna giVe it my best shot.

659
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,555
All right.

660
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,671
HaVe it your way, then.

661
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:30,394
Run him oVer!

662
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,194
I said run him oVer!

663
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,596
Get off the track, Daniel!

664
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,634
Don't be a fool!

665
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:11,477
- Daniel!
- Help!

666
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:21,834
Help! Help me!

667
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:27,317
God help him.

668
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,554
What the hell?

669
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,753
John Henry! Where haVe you been?

670
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,918
Just waiting for you
to make your moVe, Daniel.

671
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:54,554
Just waiting for you
to make your moVe!

672
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,550
Kill them and be done with it!

673
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,469
Hold it right there!

674
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,951
I got no fight with you.

675
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:30,836
No, defenceless young'uns
and farmers are more your style!

676
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,993
Mister, you just killed yourself.

677
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:55,798
My trigger finger's gone!

678
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,039
Well, come on!
What are we waiting for?

679
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,833
More steam!

680
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,636
100 dollars an acre!

681
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:46,394
I'll pay you 150 dollars an acre!
200 an acre!

682
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:51,196
300! 500 dollars an acre!

683
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,239
One more oughta do her.

684
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,551
Boy! Be reasonable!

685
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,753
You know we're gonna win in the end!
Stop!

686
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:00,315
Just stop.

687
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:05,558
All right. I admit it.

688
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:09,673
You got me oVer a barrel.
My back's to the wall.

689
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:11,836
Name your price.

690
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,393
I ain't interested!

691
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,352
You fool!

692
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,835
There'll be others just like me!

693
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:20,952
And more after them, and after them.

694
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:26,799
Long as there's a profit to be made,
we'll neVer stop.

695
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:29,154
We're coming!

696
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:32,356
Not through our land!

697
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:23,514
Daniel!

698
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,514
- We did it.
- We sure did!

699
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,912
Kinda makes it all worthwhile, don't it?

700
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,920
It's a right nice sunset, huh, Pa?

701
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,956
Yes, Daniel.

702
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:14,230
It's a good one.

703
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,912
Well, time to call it a day.

704
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:23,599
Come on.

705
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,791
Let's get washed up for supper.

706
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:30,673
You coming?

707
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,836
You go on.

708
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:38,034
Think I'll just stay here a piece.

709
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,755
Pa?

710
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,590
I loVe you, Pa.

711
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:55,194
I loVe you, too, son.

712
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:15,993
We come to say goodbye, Dannel.

713
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:22,120
I knew you would.

714
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:29,275
- Thanks, Paul.
- Thank you, Daniel.

715
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:31,277
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

716
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:35,075
Thanks to you, I got my old appetite
back again.

717
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,953
Baby and I are gonna head
up to the Alaskas.

718
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:42,597
Hear they got some little tiny
forests ain't eVen half-growed yet.

719
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:00,672
What about you, John Henry?

720
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:04,793
I'Ve been thinking about a rematch
with that there steam drill!

721
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,755
- Well, if you eVer need a shaker...
- I'll keep you in mind!

722
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:21,238
I'm much obliged, too, Dannel.

723
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,072
To the Code!

724
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:39,914
To the Code!

725
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:07,158
You done right. I thought it weren't
possible to do right no more.

726
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:12,797
- Now, 'cause of you, I know it is.
- You're the one who did eVerything.

727
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:18,353
Widowmaker.

728
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,956
So long, Widowmaker.

729
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,116
So long, boy.

730
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:28,475
Well, hop on.

731
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:34,077
- Me alone on Widowmaker?
- Lessen you don't haVe a mind to.

732
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:39,113
OK, up you go.

733
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,995
He's all yourn, Dannel Hackett.

734
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:34,399
Pecos!

735
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:38,798
So long, Dannel!
Take good care o' Widowmaker!

736
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,390
- Pecos, don't go!
- Don't worry about it.

737
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:44,591
You can handle things from here!

738
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,232
I am a ring-tailed roarer!
I draw faster, shoot straighter

739
01:27:56,440 --> 01:28:01,070
and drink longer than any man aliVe.
I'm the rip-snortingest cowboy

740
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,236
that eVer rode north, south,

741
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:07,592
east or west of the Rio Grande.
I'm Pecos Bill!

742
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,676
So long, Pecos.
