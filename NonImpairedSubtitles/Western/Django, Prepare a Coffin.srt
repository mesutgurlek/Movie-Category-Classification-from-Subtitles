1
00:02:34,302 --> 00:02:37,327
And so, my friends, as your senator 
and fellow citizen

2
00:02:37,327 --> 00:02:41,186
it gives me great pleasure to congratulate 
you on the outcome of this election.

3
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:47,132
An outcome that goes well for the future of 
freedom, democracy and the pursuit of happiness.

4
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:50,887
I feel bound to say that I consider it a great honor

5
00:02:51,617 --> 00:02:56,103
that you have chosen my candidate, 
the man that I was first to be proposed

6
00:02:56,103 --> 00:02:59,545
as your representative in the State Senate.

7
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:05,490
And now, Ladies and gentlemen, 
how about a big had to David Barry?

8
00:03:07,994 --> 00:03:09,663
Thank you. Thanks, folks.

9
00:03:56,602 --> 00:03:59,001
You don't agree with Senator Logan, right, Dean?

10
00:04:00,565 --> 00:04:02,130
No, I sure don't.

11
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:04,946
You probably know what I feel anyway.

12
00:04:05,572 --> 00:04:08,389
You're ambitious. You're cruel and unscrupulous.

13
00:04:08,806 --> 00:04:10,788
You're only in politics to make money.

14
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,082
I hate people like you, David.

15
00:04:13,604 --> 00:04:15,482
I bet we'd be better without you.

16
00:04:19,028 --> 00:04:21,636
Maybe we better set this straight once and for all.

17
00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:26,121
Without them.

18
00:04:27,686 --> 00:04:28,833
Just the two of us.

19
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:16,398
Forget it, David. The senator is waiting for you.

20
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:19,110
Don't make him angry. He gets impatient.

21
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:25,890
Wouldn't it be better to postpone this 
until after the party?

22
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:32,670
What do you think, Dean?

23
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:38,094
Better keep out of this, boy. 
Because you will find that it is hopeless.

24
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:23,260
Excuse me, I was a little nervous.

25
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:26,806
I can't take them any longer.

26
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:30,874
If you don't learn to relax 
your new job is gonna get you down

27
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:33,691
...six feet under.

28
00:06:36,716 --> 00:06:38,385
I suppose I'm tired.

29
00:06:38,906 --> 00:06:40,262
I think I need to rest.

30
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:42,140
Give up this kind of life.

31
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:47,773
Think how nice it would be to have a wife, 
children... a fine ranch?

32
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,258
Wait peacefully for the last judgement.

33
00:06:52,988 --> 00:06:54,344
No, Django.

34
00:06:56,013 --> 00:07:00,081
Oh no. All of that is not for me.

35
00:07:02,376 --> 00:07:04,462
I'm too ambitious. It's true.

36
00:07:06,757 --> 00:07:10,199
It is like having something burning 
always inside your mind.

37
00:07:10,825 --> 00:07:12,598
To succeed I'm ready for anything.

38
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:16,770
Anything.

39
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:21,047
Come along, Django. I need somebody like you.

40
00:07:21,777 --> 00:07:24,594
I swear that in a few years we 
will have so much money and influence

41
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:27,201
we won't need anything else 
for the rest of our life.

42
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:38,780
Aren't you coming to the party?

43
00:07:41,283 --> 00:07:43,682
No. I have to leave early tomorrow.

44
00:07:45,455 --> 00:07:46,185
Oh, really?

45
00:07:46,185 --> 00:07:47,854
The usual job?

46
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:51,922
It's bigger than usual.

47
00:07:53,487 --> 00:07:55,782
All the gold from the Bank of Hampton.

48
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:58,285
I will lead the caravan with the gold.

49
00:07:58,703 --> 00:08:00,893
- Where?
- Atlanta. My wife is coming.

50
00:08:05,587 --> 00:08:08,925
I'd like to come along too, Django. 
To meet new people and amuse myself.

51
00:08:10,594 --> 00:08:14,349
I once met some a french dancer from Atlanta. 
Quite something.

52
00:08:28,013 --> 00:08:29,891
- Hi there.
- Good morning, darling.

53
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:32,394
- You're wake already?
- Is is late?

54
00:08:33,437 --> 00:08:38,236
No. Don't be silly. The stars are still shining 
and the sun will be out in a few hours.

55
00:08:40,948 --> 00:08:43,347
We are coming to a lake. It is the only water in 20 miles.

56
00:08:44,911 --> 00:08:48,145
You're going to make yourself pretty,
I am gonna water the horses. alright?

57
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:49,397
Okay, darling.

58
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:10,884
Pull it out.

59
00:09:20,585 --> 00:09:22,775
Here. Put one under here and one there.

60
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:24,862
All right now... One!

61
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,275
Come on! Let's ride!

62
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:28,781
Operator. Operator...

63
00:11:29,406 --> 00:11:31,180
- Santa Fe?
- Yeah.

64
00:11:31,701 --> 00:11:34,413
Is that you, Effie? Alright, yeah.

65
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,855
No, no, no... The hangman is up your way?

66
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:41,402
I will leave him the message.

67
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:46,304
The sheriff said he got to get over here right away. 
There is work for him to do.

68
00:11:49,121 --> 00:11:51,520
I sure will. Remember me to all.

69
00:11:55,484 --> 00:11:57,361
You should not make noises when someone is calling.

70
00:11:58,091 --> 00:11:59,134
It's rude.

71
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:16,554
Hey, young fellow...

72
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:21,769
You must have been there when I was making 
that call. Why don't say you something?

73
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,525
What is it all about?

74
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,341
The sheriff wants you to do 
some neck-stressing for him.

75
00:12:28,654 --> 00:12:30,218
Neck-stressing... Neck-stressing.

76
00:12:30,218 --> 00:12:32,826
And you're next if you don't shut up.

77
00:12:35,017 --> 00:12:36,373
It is a Mexican farmer.

78
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:38,876
And what did he do?

79
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:42,736
It must be something that got him
to your clicking machine.

80
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:46,386
For five years now the gold 
from the local mine has been stolen

81
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,203
on its way to the office of Santa Fe.

82
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,044
For five years they've been investigating 
where the gold disappeared to

83
00:12:55,461 --> 00:12:57,026
and who is behind the robbery.

84
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,634
For five years the same story.

85
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,137
Someone stole the gold and not able to stop it.

86
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:05,683
So they grabbed the chicken thief 
they find and throw him in jail

87
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:10,273
convicting him of stealing the gold and 
ask that you put a new "scarf" around his throat.

88
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:13,298
You ought to be used to hang the innocent. 
You have a lot of practice at it.

89
00:13:13,715 --> 00:13:15,071
I want a drink! I want a drink!

90
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:19,452
You got plenty of water.

91
00:13:19,974 --> 00:13:20,913
No?

92
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,355
Tell the sheriff to hold off this execution.

93
00:13:24,772 --> 00:13:26,337
I got two others to do in the next county.

94
00:13:28,423 --> 00:13:29,466
If you say so...

95
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:32,595
When is the next shipment leaving?

96
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,307
It is better to leave off that corn liquor.

97
00:13:36,768 --> 00:13:38,854
It's cider. Nothing but cider.

98
00:13:41,148 --> 00:13:42,192
Isn't that right?

99
00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:55,856
Awful! Watch out, you might poison yourself!

100
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,777
Take my advice, young fellow. Stick to alcohol.

101
00:14:00,863 --> 00:14:03,992
You're right, Horace. You're always, always...

102
00:14:03,992 --> 00:14:05,870
No, no! You better not drink anymore.

103
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,686
You got a work tomorrow, Django.

104
00:14:10,251 --> 00:14:13,484
I'll let you know when they 
send out the next shipment of gold.

105
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:28,274
Jonathan Habit, you got something to say before hanging?

106
00:15:29,838 --> 00:15:31,194
I am innocent.

107
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,648
It has that effect on everybody. 
It makes them real hungry.

108
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:53,054
This takes care of "you."

109
00:17:54,723 --> 00:17:57,748
Now you go 15 miles north to Mendez Fort.

110
00:17:58,061 --> 00:18:00,878
There is a deserted village. 
You will find some friends.

111
00:18:02,651 --> 00:18:04,633
But my wife, my children...

112
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,197
They'll wait for you.

113
00:18:06,823 --> 00:18:08,805
Then what's going to happen?

114
00:18:10,683 --> 00:18:13,290
Now you are asking too much.

115
00:18:21,426 --> 00:18:22,261
Yankee!

116
00:18:25,807 --> 00:18:29,458
That's what I got for hanging you. 
You may need money. Take it.

117
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:46,461
They hang you again if you'll go back.

118
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:49,277
This time I'm afraid I won't have the pleasure.

119
00:18:50,007 --> 00:18:52,928
And if you run away, 
you will be a phantom forever.

120
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:56,787
But if I were you,
I'd go to that village in Mendez.

121
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:06,383
Howdy, sheriff.

122
00:19:07,635 --> 00:19:09,513
Well, it's about time you got here.

123
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,599
I was on another job.

124
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:12,955
Go on.

125
00:19:24,638 --> 00:19:27,767
If I were you I'd hurry up. 
He is more dead than alive.

126
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,957
If you don't hang him fast you lose your fee.

127
00:19:41,118 --> 00:19:43,622
What do you want? What are you doing here? I am innocent!

128
00:19:43,935 --> 00:19:46,334
- Innocent, I tell you.
- If you value your life, keep still.

129
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:49,880
Take off your coat.

130
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:53,948
- Get up.
- What are you going to do?

131
00:19:55,096 --> 00:19:56,973
Get into this. It has got a hook.

132
00:20:03,023 --> 00:20:04,796
Come on. Tie it.

133
00:20:12,724 --> 00:20:14,080
What if they see the hook?

134
00:20:14,706 --> 00:20:17,626
They can't see. You have a hood on.

135
00:20:17,939 --> 00:20:20,860
Pretend to be dead. Tonight I cut you down.

136
00:20:22,425 --> 00:20:23,676
Sheriff, we are ready.

137
00:20:26,597 --> 00:20:28,787
It wouldn't be a bad idea 
if you go out screaming.

138
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:32,647
I am innocent! I am innocent! 
You can not do this thing.

139
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,132
I don't want to die. I didn't do anything!

140
00:20:45,373 --> 00:20:46,729
Cheer up, son.

141
00:20:55,491 --> 00:20:58,098
No, no. You can't! You murderers!

142
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:02,166
You can't hang him! He did nothing!

143
00:21:02,584 --> 00:21:05,713
Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

144
00:21:06,756 --> 00:21:08,425
You murderers! Murderers!

145
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:13,536
He is innocent! Garcia, tell them 
that you are innocent!

146
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,144
Garcia! Garcia!

147
00:21:16,978 --> 00:21:18,751
- Help me!
- Why don't you do something?

148
00:21:18,751 --> 00:21:22,298
Are you all cowards? 
Why don't you speak up?

149
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:26,470
Why don't you tell the truth? 
You know he didn't do anything!

150
00:21:26,992 --> 00:21:29,182
He is innocent! 
He is innocent!

151
00:21:30,225 --> 00:21:32,625
You can't hang him! Let him go!

152
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,962
You are nothing but murderers. Let go!

153
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:37,944
Leave him alone!

154
00:21:39,092 --> 00:21:42,847
He is innocent! 
I tell you! He is innocent!

155
00:21:48,688 --> 00:21:51,609
The hangman has to do his work in peace, sheriff.

156
00:21:52,652 --> 00:21:54,947
He has to be left alone so he can do his job.

157
00:21:56,511 --> 00:21:59,745
This kind of ugly scene is 
bad for the towns reputation.

158
00:22:00,475 --> 00:22:01,414
Take her away.

159
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:58,053
Django, I don't know how to use one of these.

160
00:22:58,575 --> 00:22:59,722
Garcia will show you.

161
00:23:02,852 --> 00:23:04,208
That is Garcia.

162
00:23:05,668 --> 00:23:06,607
I'll help you.

163
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:17,246
Django, why didn't you bring us whiskey?

164
00:23:19,332 --> 00:23:21,314
It would be nice to have a little drink.

165
00:23:23,296 --> 00:23:24,444
I need one.

166
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,738
Do you?

167
00:23:27,469 --> 00:23:29,868
Well, I guess I can wait.

168
00:23:56,362 --> 00:23:58,135
I'm fed up, gringo.

169
00:23:58,866 --> 00:24:01,056
I've been here a month at least.

170
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:05,541
You still haven't told us why you 
are keeping everybody here in this place.

171
00:24:06,063 --> 00:24:08,045
Or why you have saved us anyway.

172
00:24:09,505 --> 00:24:11,800
I need you. I have to settle an account.

173
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:17,224
Lukas?

174
00:24:21,396 --> 00:24:22,544
That's right.

175
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:30,054
Hombres, come over here. The gringo 
has something very interesting to say.

176
00:24:33,183 --> 00:24:35,582
Lukas is powerful.

177
00:24:36,417 --> 00:24:41,945
His men are all outlaws. 
Killers he has got out of jail.

178
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:44,136
They terrorize the whole country.

179
00:24:44,866 --> 00:24:47,369
They stop at nothing to get their way.

180
00:24:48,412 --> 00:24:51,124
- You better watch out.
- Are you afraid?

181
00:24:51,646 --> 00:24:53,732
No. But...

182
00:24:56,444 --> 00:24:59,260
What do we get in exchange?

183
00:25:01,555 --> 00:25:02,911
Your life, for now.

184
00:25:04,267 --> 00:25:07,188
Afterwards, if you manage to keep it...

185
00:25:08,127 --> 00:25:11,464
You can go home free, and clear the blame.

186
00:25:12,195 --> 00:25:13,446
You've thought of a plan?

187
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:22,313
All the witnesses against are to blame.
They wanted you hanged.

188
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:29,093
You've got to find them. One by one.

189
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:35,143
And make them understand that 
the time for repentance has come.

190
00:25:35,873 --> 00:25:38,063
I was sick at home...

191
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,027
And that coward Bill Kirby 
said he saw me going outside.

192
00:25:42,757 --> 00:25:45,678
That's how they convicted me. He betrayed me.

193
00:25:46,721 --> 00:25:48,703
Just to get hold of my land.

194
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:53,292
He'll pay. He'll pay for that trick. 
You can bet on it.

195
00:25:53,814 --> 00:25:55,379
Sure he will, Jonathan.

196
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,047
Now calm down.

197
00:25:57,465 --> 00:25:58,716
Than what should we do?

198
00:25:58,716 --> 00:26:02,367
You are dead men. Just phantoms.

199
00:26:04,871 --> 00:26:08,104
Go to their houses. 
Let yourselves be seen.

200
00:26:10,086 --> 00:26:15,093
I think you will have a good time. 
Enjoy yourselves. But no killing.

201
00:26:17,283 --> 00:26:18,431
Why not?

202
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,272
They're all innocent who illegally 
condemned. Not murderers.

203
00:26:25,107 --> 00:26:26,358
I don't like it.

204
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:30,844
What's the matter if we kill someone?

205
00:26:36,268 --> 00:26:37,937
Pedro, José, vamos.

206
00:26:42,317 --> 00:26:43,256
Where are you going?

207
00:26:45,238 --> 00:26:48,472
Don't worry, Django. 
We won't spoil your little game.

208
00:26:49,306 --> 00:26:52,748
We know how to keep... silent.

209
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:56,608
It's too late now. You should have 
thought about going sooner.

210
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,737
I advise you to stay right here.

211
00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:02,866
- Yeah? Until when?
- I don't know.

212
00:27:03,284 --> 00:27:06,204
I already told you. 
We're getting out of here right now!

213
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:09,959
Wait a minute!

214
00:27:40,313 --> 00:27:43,234
Thanks for saving my life.

215
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,499
You go around back and open the corral.

216
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,048
Walker! It's me, Walker!

217
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:18,386
Walker, remember me?

218
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:20,994
Why have you done this? Who are you?

219
00:28:21,515 --> 00:28:25,062
Abbott, remember? Lukas paid you 
to send me to the gallows.

220
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:26,939
Now I'm going to pay you!

221
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,903
Liar!

222
00:28:34,137 --> 00:28:37,162
Go see Lukas and tell him...

223
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:40,082
Jonathan Abbott is back from the dead.

224
00:28:43,003 --> 00:28:44,255
Vamos, muchachos.

225
00:28:48,844 --> 00:28:51,452
- What is this? Who is there?
- It's me, Wallace. Remember me?

226
00:28:54,268 --> 00:28:55,937
I went back to pay you.

227
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,484
Hanging me. How did you like it?!

228
00:29:05,012 --> 00:29:07,202
It's me, Kat! The man you hanged!

229
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,915
You dirty double-crosser!

230
00:29:20,554 --> 00:29:22,849
- Hi, Dan.
- Wallace?

231
00:29:22,849 --> 00:29:23,892
You?

232
00:29:28,377 --> 00:29:29,942
So you thought you could get away with it?

233
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:32,862
Sell out your friends for a few dollar!

234
00:29:34,636 --> 00:29:36,826
Remember me? I'm Jonathan.

235
00:29:36,826 --> 00:29:39,017
The ghost of Jonathan.

236
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:45,171
Conway! Bill Conway, come out! 
It's your friend Wallace!

237
00:29:45,692 --> 00:29:46,736
Come on out!

238
00:30:33,466 --> 00:30:34,822
All right, who you did this to you?

239
00:30:34,822 --> 00:30:37,951
We got beat up last night. Like the others.

240
00:30:38,055 --> 00:30:42,124
They were attacked and whipped. 
After that their houses were burned down.

241
00:30:42,228 --> 00:30:43,792
Who did it?

242
00:30:49,112 --> 00:30:50,677
Well? What's the matter?

243
00:30:50,781 --> 00:30:52,554
It was John Abbott.

244
00:30:53,493 --> 00:30:57,770
You're crazy. It couldn't have been Abbott.

245
00:30:58,291 --> 00:30:59,647
But it was Abbott. I swear to you!

246
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,151
And he wasn't the only one. I saw Pat Mahoney.

247
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:06,115
And Andy saw Jake O'Connor. Right, Andy?

248
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:07,262
Idiots!

249
00:31:07,888 --> 00:31:09,244
You pack of fools.

250
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:14,355
A corpse is a corpse. 
Everyone of them is buried, five feet under.

251
00:31:14,668 --> 00:31:17,693
No, Lukas! I saw Johnatan Abbott with my own eyes!

252
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,570
And he was no corpse!

253
00:31:34,382 --> 00:31:36,051
Listen boss, I have got something to tell.

254
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,101
Come around later and bring your family.

255
00:31:43,144 --> 00:31:44,813
I have some special whiskey for you.

256
00:31:45,335 --> 00:31:48,986
With a couple of shots of it 
you'll stop imagining you're seeing dead men.

257
00:31:59,103 --> 00:31:59,834
What is it?

258
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:03,380
Tomorrow morning a lot of gold leave 
the mines at Las Cruzes...

259
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,466
On the way to the bank of Santa Fe.

260
00:32:05,988 --> 00:32:09,326
And I found out more. It is certain 
they're gonna take the Sierra Road.

261
00:32:09,952 --> 00:32:13,915
If they don't have trouble with the river, 
the day after tomorrow they will be

262
00:32:14,437 --> 00:32:16,523
as far as the pass and they'll be safe.

263
00:32:16,836 --> 00:32:18,922
It's the first time they picked the Sierra, right?

264
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:21,321
Yes, and I'm afraid it will be the last.

265
00:32:21,947 --> 00:32:24,138
Don't put me to the trouble of having to call you.

266
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:27,997
If all goes the way they planned it, 
they want you in five days exactly.

267
00:32:28,727 --> 00:32:30,709
This time the trial will be short.

268
00:32:31,544 --> 00:32:34,568
They already was is guilty. Sam Copper.

269
00:32:35,194 --> 00:32:37,281
He tried to shoot his wife twice.

270
00:32:37,593 --> 00:32:40,931
They got him locked away outside the town. 
He will be judged as soon as the gold is stolen.

271
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:45,417
Poor Sam. All he tried to do was defend his good name

272
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:49,589
and now they're gonna hang him for 
an out-of-law. Two times double-crossed.

273
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:07,530
So long, fellows.

274
00:33:07,947 --> 00:33:09,825
- Bye, Horace.
- See you soon.

275
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,065
Garcia, I got something important to tell you.

276
00:33:21,925 --> 00:33:22,863
Well?

277
00:33:22,863 --> 00:33:25,054
I forgot what it was.

278
00:33:29,226 --> 00:33:31,730
Garcia, I remember what it was now.

279
00:33:32,773 --> 00:33:34,546
Tomorrow they're gonna hang your wife.

280
00:33:37,884 --> 00:33:39,031
Well, that's life.

281
00:33:39,031 --> 00:33:40,805
Why didn't you warn me?

282
00:33:41,222 --> 00:33:42,369
I figured you needed a day off.

283
00:33:42,891 --> 00:33:45,707
I think you don't get enough rest.

284
00:33:46,855 --> 00:33:50,401
You've been working too hard, Django. 
Why let not old Bill do the job?

285
00:33:50,923 --> 00:33:53,426
He may not have your light touch 
but his price is cheaper than yours.

286
00:33:54,052 --> 00:33:55,408
And he is well with the sheriff.

287
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:59,476
- Why convict Mercedes?
- Barry told everybody she was your accomplice.

288
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:01,353
And then?

289
00:34:01,353 --> 00:34:03,648
She was tried, convicted and sentenced.

290
00:34:04,691 --> 00:34:06,256
Now, I gotta be moving along.

291
00:34:06,882 --> 00:34:09,281
Horace, don't call old Bill.

292
00:34:09,802 --> 00:34:11,889
I've decided to "hang" Mercedes.

293
00:34:12,514 --> 00:34:15,227
A hanging is a hanging, 
no matter who does it, Django.

294
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:20,025
It makes no difference 
to the fellow who is strung up.

295
00:34:21,068 --> 00:34:21,902
See you tomorrow.

296
00:34:24,301 --> 00:34:25,136
Let's go.

297
00:34:47,249 --> 00:34:49,961
Tomorrow a lot of gold is leaving 
Las Cruzes for Santa Fe.

298
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,551
It will be passing the Sierra the day after tomorrow.

299
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,472
I think it'll be ambushed at Hondo Pass.

300
00:34:57,889 --> 00:34:58,723
Whom by?

301
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:01,122
The Lukas gang.

302
00:35:01,853 --> 00:35:04,043
I thought we could play cat and mouse with them.

303
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:08,111
But now the time has come to settle our accounts.

304
00:35:08,946 --> 00:35:09,780
With this?

305
00:35:10,197 --> 00:35:11,240
Not yet.

306
00:35:12,492 --> 00:35:14,787
We'll be waiting for them in the Sierra.

307
00:35:15,517 --> 00:35:17,812
And we will attack them when 
they try to grab the gold.

308
00:35:18,646 --> 00:35:20,002
Try not to kill them.

309
00:35:21,463 --> 00:35:25,635
We have to take them to the governor and make them confess everything.

310
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:27,408
Aren't you coming with us?

311
00:35:31,268 --> 00:35:32,728
I meet you in the Sierra.

312
00:35:33,145 --> 00:35:35,544
What is the idea? You're running out on us?

313
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:57,866
It was for me that he did it.

314
00:35:59,848 --> 00:36:01,309
They're going to hang my wife tomorrow.

315
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:04,542
He is going to help her.

316
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,340
I'm sorry about you and your wife.

317
00:36:10,383 --> 00:36:12,261
But there is something more important to do.

318
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,839
You mean that gold?

319
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,343
That's right.

320
00:36:29,889 --> 00:36:31,871
You want your names cleared?

321
00:36:36,774 --> 00:36:37,817
Go on.

322
00:36:44,492 --> 00:36:47,726
We're get them to confess... Lukas and his men.

323
00:36:48,561 --> 00:36:51,794
We go back to our homes and say:

324
00:36:51,794 --> 00:36:55,028
"Look!" Your men are back . "

325
00:36:56,488 --> 00:36:57,635
What will they do?

326
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:04,103
Then we speak to the judge and tell him
we don't belong to gang of Lukas.

327
00:37:05,354 --> 00:37:08,066
Perhaps he'll believe us... he might not.

328
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,926
You see that?

329
00:37:11,926 --> 00:37:14,533
He'll just has to believe! It's the truth!

330
00:37:14,846 --> 00:37:18,289
Suppose he does. Then what?

331
00:37:20,896 --> 00:37:24,338
Afterwards we all go home...

332
00:37:25,382 --> 00:37:26,633
to misery...

333
00:37:27,363 --> 00:37:30,493
To go on and on and breaking our backs 
to provide food

334
00:37:31,014 --> 00:37:33,831
until finally another "Lukas" tries 
to take our land away again.

335
00:37:34,456 --> 00:37:35,604
So what are you getting at?

336
00:37:37,481 --> 00:37:41,967
I've been thinking it over. There's 
a lot of gold that might belong to us.

337
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:45,200
Are you gone loco?

338
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,391
We ambush them before they reach the Sierra.

339
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:52,293
We'll go to meet them, before Lukas.

340
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,865
It will be a surprise.

341
00:37:59,178 --> 00:38:02,516
You are all cowards. You should have been hanged.

342
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:05,228
It would have been better for all of you.

343
00:38:07,209 --> 00:38:08,461
I'm making tracks.

344
00:38:16,806 --> 00:38:19,831
Wallace, you can't leave now.

345
00:38:24,942 --> 00:38:27,550
You shouldn't have done this, dirty Indian!

346
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,030
Anyone else?

347
00:38:48,933 --> 00:38:49,559
Vamos!

348
00:39:09,586 --> 00:39:10,838
Howdy, Sheriff.

349
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,010
There you are.

350
00:39:20,434 --> 00:39:21,790
- It's you.
- Yeah.

351
00:39:23,042 --> 00:39:27,632
Well, this time you got a woman, young fellow. 
Don' spend a long time looking at her

352
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:30,552
or she will try to get around you. 
Yeah. That's Women.

353
00:40:07,269 --> 00:40:08,938
- Put this on.
- No!

354
00:40:09,459 --> 00:40:14,049
Quick. Under your blouse. It will 
keep you from being strangled.

355
00:40:42,212 --> 00:40:45,550
If you don't stop that words I'm gonna 
wash your mouth with soap and water.

356
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,859
Ain't you Pat O'Connor, the fellow that got hanged?

357
00:40:59,006 --> 00:40:59,528
Yes...

358
00:41:01,927 --> 00:41:04,952
You look sick. Son, you've been wounded.

359
00:41:06,203 --> 00:41:08,185
- Where is Django?
- Django?

360
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:11,210
What do you want with Django?

361
00:41:12,566 --> 00:41:14,339
I'd say you need a doctor.

362
00:41:15,487 --> 00:41:18,825
I don't want to worry you, boy, 
but you are in a pretty bad way.

363
00:41:22,476 --> 00:41:23,623
Calls him...

364
00:41:24,145 --> 00:41:27,169
I mean it... It's serious...

365
00:41:27,169 --> 00:41:30,403
I see it's serious. That is no mosquito bite.

366
00:41:31,342 --> 00:41:32,802
A little whiskey might do you good.

367
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:38,122
If it don't... pray. They say it helps sometimes.

368
00:41:55,437 --> 00:41:57,210
It's Pat O'Connor! The ghost of Pat O'Connor!

369
00:41:57,628 --> 00:41:59,297
Shut up, you fool, 
help me to get him out of here.

370
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,634
Come on!

371
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,632
I was they would come by here.

372
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,970
How soon we're gonna attack them?

373
00:42:35,387 --> 00:42:37,682
Before they reach the Pass. Come on!

374
00:42:58,544 --> 00:43:01,986
- Here come the fellows now.
- I didn't expect to see them so early.

375
00:43:10,435 --> 00:43:11,583
They are shooting for real!

376
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,964
- Crazy fool! Why don't they stop shooting?
- What if they really are bandits?

377
00:44:54,744 --> 00:44:56,935
- Let's go. We go to move.
- Let's split this up.

378
00:44:57,456 --> 00:45:00,064
No! We have to get over the frontier.

379
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:01,316
Okay.

380
00:45:24,576 --> 00:45:26,454
This marks your grave.

381
00:45:27,288 --> 00:45:28,436
Now you can go.

382
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:34,486
Find some hiding place. I hope in a few days 
you and your husband can be together again.

383
00:45:35,112 --> 00:45:36,155
Alive and free.

384
00:45:37,615 --> 00:45:39,597
Adios and thank you, Django.

385
00:45:43,561 --> 00:45:44,499
Ride!

386
00:45:45,751 --> 00:45:46,481
Shoot!

387
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:00,667
Howdy, hangman.

388
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:06,799
That's enough.

389
00:47:38,509 --> 00:47:39,552
Where is the girl?

390
00:47:46,228 --> 00:47:48,001
Smart idea you had, mister.

391
00:47:49,253 --> 00:47:51,548
Pretending to string everybody up like that.

392
00:47:53,634 --> 00:47:54,990
I have to give you credit for that.

393
00:47:56,242 --> 00:47:58,328
You know I like people who can think.

394
00:47:59,058 --> 00:48:01,457
Because they usually...

395
00:48:05,003 --> 00:48:07,611
have enough sense to not to get killed.

396
00:48:11,992 --> 00:48:14,496
Why not be reasonable and play your cards right?

397
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,521
You know, I might give you a job.

398
00:48:18,251 --> 00:48:19,085
Django...

399
00:48:19,607 --> 00:48:20,963
It was Garcia.

400
00:48:24,718 --> 00:48:28,264
He convinced the others to do what he said. 
To get the gold first.

401
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:30,768
Wallace and me refuse to go along...

402
00:48:31,289 --> 00:48:32,854
He killed Wallace, but I got away...

403
00:48:33,584 --> 00:48:34,627
Sorry, I...

404
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:37,965
- You don't know anything?
- No... no.

405
00:48:40,677 --> 00:48:43,598
I bet you're on with Garcia, buzzard.

406
00:49:32,831 --> 00:49:34,083
That's plenty!

407
00:49:48,374 --> 00:49:50,668
You two stay here and guard him.

408
00:49:52,233 --> 00:49:54,423
Send someone to call me as soon as he comes to.

409
00:50:21,648 --> 00:50:25,299
- It's Lukas.
- Come on.

410
00:51:01,911 --> 00:51:03,163
Evening, David.

411
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:06,918
You are getting old, Lukas.

412
00:51:07,961 --> 00:51:09,943
It was an accident, unavoidable.

413
00:51:12,551 --> 00:51:15,680
I pay you to avoid them. All of them.

414
00:51:18,183 --> 00:51:20,270
You shouldn't talk to me like that, David.

415
00:51:21,104 --> 00:51:23,920
I worked for you since the beginning. 
Sometimes there are accidents.

416
00:51:24,442 --> 00:51:27,258
For five years you had your nerves 
under control. Now you don't.

417
00:51:30,492 --> 00:51:31,639
Maybe you're tired.

418
00:51:33,308 --> 00:51:33,934
Maybe.

419
00:51:35,707 --> 00:51:37,689
I warned you that gold was important to me.

420
00:51:43,009 --> 00:51:46,451
I can not give excuses or empty promises

421
00:51:48,537 --> 00:51:49,476
And you know it.

422
00:51:50,728 --> 00:51:53,023
You haven't picked a good time to be tired.

423
00:51:55,422 --> 00:51:57,821
Let me worry about that. 
I find where they have hid it.

424
00:52:00,011 --> 00:52:01,889
I don't think they can bring it out the country.

425
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,288
There are federal troops guarding the border.

426
00:52:05,227 --> 00:52:07,209
They may try to get rid of it, by selling the gold.

427
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:10,338
In that case the receiver is sure to contact me.

428
00:52:12,737 --> 00:52:14,093
What if they are going to another state?

429
00:52:15,136 --> 00:52:16,805
We have an "Trump card".

430
00:52:17,327 --> 00:52:20,352
The man who caused the trouble. 
The one who organized everything.

431
00:52:21,916 --> 00:52:24,837
We let him out and he'll lead us to 
the place where the gold is hidden.

432
00:52:25,567 --> 00:52:26,297
Who is he?

433
00:52:26,297 --> 00:52:27,757
The local hangman.

434
00:52:28,592 --> 00:52:29,948
Goes by the name of Django.

435
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:37,145
What is it?

436
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,544
Django... You idiot!

437
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,612
You really are tired. You've lost your memory!

438
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:53,835
- Do you have data?
- Yeah.

439
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:55,377
Yes, Django. It's me.

440
00:53:57,046 --> 00:53:58,193
Are you surprised?

441
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:01,322
Five years ago I advised you to join up, remember?

442
00:54:02,157 --> 00:54:04,869
I promised you honor and wealth, remember?

443
00:54:06,434 --> 00:54:09,667
You wouldn't listen. You were wrong.

444
00:54:10,919 --> 00:54:12,588
Filthy murderer.

445
00:54:16,343 --> 00:54:18,012
The same old arrogant.

446
00:54:18,951 --> 00:54:21,141
The same stupid and naive Django.

447
00:54:22,393 --> 00:54:26,774
Five years... five years and you haven't changed.

448
00:54:27,504 --> 00:54:31,468
I bet you're still dream about that 
cozy farmhouse with a pretty girl

449
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:38,248
to look after you... How did you put it? 
To wait happily for the Judgement day.

450
00:54:39,395 --> 00:54:40,438
Wasn't that it?

451
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:44,089
I have only one thing left...

452
00:54:45,967 --> 00:54:46,905
Hate!

453
00:54:47,636 --> 00:54:50,243
Yeah. But even hate has its price.

454
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,937
If you help me to recover the gold...

455
00:54:55,354 --> 00:54:56,919
one part will be yours.

456
00:54:58,588 --> 00:55:01,196
My wife's life was worth a lot more.

457
00:55:01,196 --> 00:55:04,012
That was an accident! She was a woman.

458
00:55:04,847 --> 00:55:06,828
Why worry. There are plenty of others like it...

459
00:55:09,436 --> 00:55:10,584
Leave him alone, Lukas.

460
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,069
You have been beaten enough.

461
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:29,881
He is stubborn.

462
00:55:33,219 --> 00:55:33,949
I know.

463
00:55:36,348 --> 00:55:38,330
But it is worth trying to break him.

464
00:55:44,171 --> 00:55:47,718
If he hasn't cooperated in a couple of hours, 
I'd finish him off. But uh...

465
00:55:48,656 --> 00:55:51,055
with a pistol.

466
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,602
After all he was a friend.

467
00:55:55,749 --> 00:55:56,375
Come on.

468
00:56:07,223 --> 00:56:08,684
Stop it.

469
00:56:10,248 --> 00:56:11,917
Behave yourself.

470
00:56:17,028 --> 00:56:19,427
Johnny, please you are hurting me.

471
00:56:22,765 --> 00:56:24,851
Don't do that. I can't breathe.

472
00:56:25,686 --> 00:56:27,251
Johnny, you're so gross.

473
00:56:30,797 --> 00:56:31,736
Why are you laughing?

474
00:56:32,257 --> 00:56:33,196
Who are you talking to?

475
00:56:38,203 --> 00:56:41,332
Darling, you're so big and strong.

476
00:56:46,548 --> 00:56:48,634
He won't be needing these, we can use them.

477
00:56:56,457 --> 00:56:57,604
Come on, hurry.

478
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:02,298
I'm right behind you. Let's go.

479
00:57:10,434 --> 00:57:13,564
Wake up, Django. We're here. 
Go find some water.

480
00:57:15,858 --> 00:57:17,527
Django! Django, wake up!

481
00:57:18,153 --> 00:57:20,970
Django! They sure turned you in mashed potatoes.

482
00:57:21,595 --> 00:57:23,056
Come on now, on your feet, boy.

483
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:26,602
That's right. Come on...

484
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:35,364
You'll feel better after this.

485
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,022
Where are Lukas and the others?

486
00:57:44,022 --> 00:57:46,204
It will be a miracle if you escape, Django.

487
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,777
So don't go looking for more trouble.

488
00:57:48,611 --> 00:57:50,793
- Tell me where they are.
- In the saloon.

489
00:57:58,521 --> 00:57:59,773
I need some dynamite.

490
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,841
I know my husband. He betrayed you.

491
00:58:04,258 --> 00:58:06,553
- Why did he do it?
- I don't know.

492
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:08,222
Where is Garcia?

493
00:58:09,265 --> 00:58:12,394
...I don't know where he is.

494
00:58:13,124 --> 00:58:18,339
If it is true what they say, I force him 
to come to you and make it up somehow.

495
00:58:20,113 --> 00:58:21,573
Someone's coming.

496
00:58:36,385 --> 00:58:38,158
Alvarez! Alvarez!

497
00:58:39,723 --> 00:58:41,705
Clear everybody out. We got work to do.

498
00:58:45,877 --> 00:58:47,859
Alright, everybody outside.

499
00:59:07,052 --> 00:59:11,015
- I wonder what Lukas is up to now?
- You know Lukas. Always got Something cooking.

500
01:00:15,374 --> 01:00:17,773
I'm tired of your excuses, Lukas!

501
01:00:18,816 --> 01:00:22,154
I can't use you and your gang here, 
if you don't set things right.

502
01:00:23,302 --> 01:00:28,204
I want a person who can make 
an account of the men's action.

503
01:00:29,977 --> 01:00:32,898
Nobody will take any initiative without informing me.

504
01:00:33,419 --> 01:00:35,506
I don't want any more of your stupid failures.

505
01:00:58,767 --> 01:01:00,853
I need a torch and a dozen rifles.

506
01:01:01,374 --> 01:01:05,234
The dynamite was bad enough. 
But where do I find a dozen rifles?

507
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:09,302
Beside, have you changed your mind? 
I thought you were gonna blow them up.

508
01:01:09,823 --> 01:01:12,014
There is someone inside 
who is more interested in life.

509
01:01:27,451 --> 01:01:29,120
Let's see if Django feels like talking now.

510
01:01:31,624 --> 01:01:33,606
Go on, before they discover that I've gone.

511
01:01:34,544 --> 01:01:36,422
I wait for you at the other side of the saloon.

512
01:01:40,907 --> 01:01:42,263
Tell me something, Lukas.

513
01:01:44,662 --> 01:01:48,522
If we found out that this all was a trick to 
keep the gold away where it was supposed to go,

514
01:01:50,191 --> 01:01:51,442
what would you do about it?

515
01:01:51,964 --> 01:01:53,424
Okay, that's enough, David!

516
01:01:55,719 --> 01:01:56,971
Watch what you are saying.

517
01:01:57,388 --> 01:02:01,978
I got you started, David. 
Without me you would be a none identity.

518
01:02:02,395 --> 01:02:05,941
So I don't want any more of this talk 
after I have done so much for you.

519
01:02:27,951 --> 01:02:28,785
Wait here.

520
01:02:35,774 --> 01:02:37,443
The hangman won't talk.

521
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:41,302
We have to work out some way to get that gold back.

522
01:02:56,531 --> 01:02:57,992
I had to rob the general store.

523
01:02:59,348 --> 01:03:01,329
- I'll end up in jail.
- Did you see that ladder?

524
01:03:01,851 --> 01:03:03,416
Over at the other side of the saloon.

525
01:03:04,563 --> 01:03:06,023
You climb up there.

526
01:03:07,066 --> 01:03:10,926
When you hear firing from the other side, 
you start firing too.

527
01:03:13,116 --> 01:03:15,933
You won't hit anybody, but it doesn't matter.

528
01:03:16,663 --> 01:03:18,227
Just make a lot of noise.

529
01:03:19,688 --> 01:03:21,670
Won't hit anyone? Are you crazy?

530
01:03:22,921 --> 01:03:28,032
Ask anyone here who it was who won the second price 
in the last year shot contest.

531
01:03:28,658 --> 01:03:30,119
It was third, not second.

532
01:03:30,745 --> 01:03:32,831
But see you stay under cover.

533
01:03:39,194 --> 01:03:40,028
I got you.

534
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:07,461
Takes the others into town.

535
01:04:12,051 --> 01:04:12,885
Django has escaped!

536
01:04:13,824 --> 01:04:15,284
He shot both men who where on guard.

537
01:04:15,806 --> 01:04:17,162
Bill is checking the other side of town.

538
01:04:17,683 --> 01:04:19,352
You fool!

539
01:04:24,672 --> 01:04:25,402
That must be him!

540
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,219
Quick, get the men together!

541
01:04:30,201 --> 01:04:30,826
Fire!

542
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:36,668
- Water...
- Get water!

543
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:41,987
All outside. Sam, George, come with me.

544
01:04:49,393 --> 01:04:50,436
Back inside!

545
01:04:53,044 --> 01:04:53,879
Cowards!

546
01:04:53,879 --> 01:04:58,051
You all are going to get him with me. 
I shoot anybody who don't get moving on!

547
01:06:02,097 --> 01:06:03,035
Lukas!

548
01:06:07,521 --> 01:06:08,355
Lukas!

549
01:06:09,085 --> 01:06:10,754
Remember five years ago?

550
01:06:11,589 --> 01:06:13,258
A shipment of gold from the mines.

551
01:06:16,074 --> 01:06:19,933
A wagon, a man... a woman.

552
01:06:21,081 --> 01:06:24,106
She was my wife! You killed her!

553
01:06:28,174 --> 01:06:31,303
All right, come on out, Lukas. 
Come on out while there is still time.

554
01:06:32,763 --> 01:06:33,807
Outside.

555
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:37,979
Help me out of here. Help me!

556
01:06:38,396 --> 01:06:41,108
Come out... Come out!

557
01:06:50,183 --> 01:06:51,643
Help me...

558
01:07:47,449 --> 01:07:50,056
The border is that way, 
two miles the other side of the river.

559
01:07:52,977 --> 01:07:55,898
Maybe we're better off waiting until sunset, 
don't you think?

560
01:07:56,419 --> 01:07:58,923
It's all right. Can cross in safely here.

561
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:01,948
This part is never patrolled.

562
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:17,072
Wait. I will not go with you.

563
01:08:19,889 --> 01:08:22,705
- No? And why not?
- I want to get my family.

564
01:08:23,957 --> 01:08:27,920
I want also to cross this river... but not alone.

565
01:08:28,338 --> 01:08:32,614
We all have wives and children too. 
We just have to think of them later.

566
01:08:33,449 --> 01:08:34,909
I've made up my mind.

567
01:08:48,887 --> 01:08:51,599
What about the gold? What do we do?

568
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,163
I'll take my part.

569
01:08:54,415 --> 01:08:57,753
- You will? What is your part?
- Whatever I can get.

570
01:09:19,762 --> 01:09:22,161
- How's that?
- Adios.

571
01:10:12,334 --> 01:10:13,481
All right. Let's go.

572
01:10:17,445 --> 01:10:18,801
Stay in line.

573
01:11:32,443 --> 01:11:33,382
Come in.

574
01:11:35,676 --> 01:11:40,057
Excuse me, sir. But there is a person 
who wants to speak to you.

575
01:11:44,230 --> 01:11:45,481
I don't wish to be disturbed.

576
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:04,987
Howdy, chief.

577
01:12:09,785 --> 01:12:10,724
Where are your men?

578
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,436
In Farmers City.

579
01:12:14,271 --> 01:12:17,087
Send them up to the Sierra 
to Alvez County, right away.

580
01:12:18,339 --> 01:12:19,382
But Lukas is there.

581
01:12:23,241 --> 01:12:24,284
Was there.

582
01:12:26,266 --> 01:12:27,726
He made a mistake.

583
01:12:28,665 --> 01:12:29,813
Who was it?

584
01:12:30,856 --> 01:12:33,776
The local hangman. He calls himself Django.

585
01:12:34,089 --> 01:12:35,237
It's him you want?

586
01:12:35,758 --> 01:12:40,893
Yeah... but alive.

587
01:12:45,042 --> 01:12:48,380
He is the only one who knows where 
a certain load of gold ended up.

588
01:13:26,974 --> 01:13:28,121
He's here.

589
01:13:29,686 --> 01:13:31,355
He has the gold with him.

590
01:13:32,294 --> 01:13:33,650
He is staying out of sight.

591
01:13:34,901 --> 01:13:35,736
Where?

592
01:13:39,282 --> 01:13:41,473
Are you going... to kill him?

593
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:42,620
No.

594
01:13:43,663 --> 01:13:48,149
afterwards, what will become of us?

595
01:13:49,192 --> 01:13:51,486
I only want to get back what he has stolen.

596
01:13:52,634 --> 01:13:53,886
Save my husband...

597
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,267
You saved our lives before. I don't know why.

598
01:13:59,831 --> 01:14:05,047
I beg of you, let Garcia go home 
to live again as before.

599
01:14:05,568 --> 01:14:06,611
It doesn't depend on me.

600
01:14:08,802 --> 01:14:14,434
It's in my house. A cabin, 
about a mile from here on the road to Altos.

601
01:14:15,269 --> 01:14:16,938
- Will you come with me?
- No...

602
01:14:17,772 --> 01:14:20,902
You follow me. Wait a little.

603
01:15:38,612 --> 01:15:39,863
You're Django, ain't you?

604
01:16:37,129 --> 01:16:39,215
Barry said to bring you back alive.

605
01:16:39,215 --> 01:16:40,467
Don't try anything!

606
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:44,848
Pick it up by the barrel, give it to me. 
Make it fast!

607
01:17:22,816 --> 01:17:24,589
Pack your things and go.

608
01:18:16,222 --> 01:18:17,578
You're leaving, Garcia?

609
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:24,880
Stop!

610
01:18:39,692 --> 01:18:42,612
Don't kill him, Django. You promised.

611
01:18:59,928 --> 01:19:01,075
Is it all there?

612
01:19:02,014 --> 01:19:02,953
Forgive him.

613
01:19:04,204 --> 01:19:05,873
He killed Wallace.

614
01:19:12,341 --> 01:19:14,635
Wallace and many men.

615
01:19:16,513 --> 01:19:18,182
You know what made me do it, Django.

616
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:21,807
All my life I've been poor and hungry.

617
01:19:22,667 --> 01:19:24,336
It's the same for my wife here.

618
01:19:28,195 --> 01:19:29,956
We couldn't keep on living like this.

619
01:19:30,386 --> 01:19:32,159
I'm not the judge or the sheriff.

620
01:19:33,515 --> 01:19:35,693
I only know  you betrayed my trust.

621
01:19:38,313 --> 01:19:39,774
I owe my life to you, Django.

622
01:19:40,817 --> 01:19:42,381
And once I saved yours.

623
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:45,406
The debt is paid.

624
01:19:46,762 --> 01:19:48,953
Take all the gold and leave us in peace.

625
01:19:53,334 --> 01:19:56,880
Come on. This time 
you have to do exactly what I say.

626
01:20:04,912 --> 01:20:06,894
Be a good girl and be quiet in church.

627
01:20:15,447 --> 01:20:16,386
Up we go.

628
01:20:23,792 --> 01:20:24,835
What's wrong?

629
01:20:26,191 --> 01:20:27,964
I'm join you right away, alright?

630
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:29,425
Alright.

631
01:20:44,237 --> 01:20:45,384
Good morning, sir.

632
01:20:46,531 --> 01:20:49,348
Excuse me for having dared to come at your house.

633
01:20:50,599 --> 01:20:56,024
I am here about something that
I know will interest you, sir.

634
01:20:57,275 --> 01:20:58,005
Which is?

635
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:06,037
What is it about?

636
01:21:07,497 --> 01:21:11,044
I know who stole the gold from these crosses.

637
01:22:14,777 --> 01:22:17,280
I alone, right. Where is your husband?

638
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:36,473
Garcia... Garcia!

639
01:22:57,022 --> 01:22:57,543
Well?

640
01:22:58,899 --> 01:23:00,255
Where is the gold?

641
01:23:02,654 --> 01:23:04,845
Can I be sure of what you promised me, sir?

642
01:23:08,287 --> 01:23:10,791
Here is $ 5000, as promised.

643
01:23:12,459 --> 01:23:14,128
Lukas offered me much more money.

644
01:23:14,441 --> 01:23:16,319
I made the deal with your wife, not with Lukas.

645
01:23:17,779 --> 01:23:18,927
You can count it later.

646
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:21,326
Now think about handing the gold to me.

647
01:23:24,768 --> 01:23:26,124
It's hidden.

648
01:23:26,958 --> 01:23:28,523
In the cemetery of Altez.

649
01:24:11,394 --> 01:24:12,437
Where is it hidden?

650
01:24:14,002 --> 01:24:14,941
There.

651
01:25:00,419 --> 01:25:02,401
Whose grave are you digging there?

652
01:25:04,696 --> 01:25:05,530
Yours.

653
01:25:07,512 --> 01:25:08,868
I'm here for the gold.

654
01:25:10,433 --> 01:25:11,893
Is that so?

655
01:25:22,115 --> 01:25:23,784
Shall we discuss it?

656
01:25:30,564 --> 01:25:31,920
I'll let you have half of it.

657
01:25:34,737 --> 01:25:37,240
That's a good offer. You better accept.

658
01:25:39,013 --> 01:25:41,517
My wife's life was worth a lot more.

659
01:25:43,499 --> 01:25:46,002
In the past I gave advice. 
But you wouldn't listen.

660
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:51,009
Now I've offered you one more proposition. 
But this is the last one.

661
01:25:58,519 --> 01:26:02,379
Why don't you just forget that old story 
forever and get on with things?

662
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:04,465
You know I'd like to save your life.

663
01:26:11,662 --> 01:26:14,270
For five years you robbed and killed...

664
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:17,912
Your debt to justice is pretty big.

665
01:26:19,694 --> 01:26:21,780
Now I have a advice for you...

666
01:26:23,658 --> 01:26:24,701
Pay out.

667
01:26:58,288 --> 01:26:59,540
I pay...

668
01:27:00,896 --> 01:27:02,043
But that is stupid.

669
01:27:13,204 --> 01:27:14,143
No.

670
01:27:14,873 --> 01:27:16,221
He did not betray you.

671
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:21,340
It was you and your obstinate idea 
that I am stupid, like you.

672
01:27:32,084 --> 01:27:34,066
I offer you fifty percent of that gold.

673
01:27:36,778 --> 01:27:37,717
What do you say?

674
01:27:43,141 --> 01:27:43,975
It is a shame.

675
01:27:46,792 --> 01:27:49,504
I'm afraid this is the last advice I'll give you.

676
01:27:51,173 --> 01:27:55,345
The dead are in their graves, understand? 
And you... are dead.

677
01:27:57,849 --> 01:27:59,205
You have been dead for five years.

678
01:28:03,481 --> 01:28:05,046
This is your grave. mister.

679
01:28:11,617 --> 01:28:12,347
Dig.

680
01:28:58,243 --> 01:28:59,286
Ready, boys?

681
01:31:03,623 --> 01:31:05,292
Here, Mercedez.

682
01:31:07,482 --> 01:31:08,525
It's yours.

683
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:11,237
- Take it.
- I can not.

684
01:31:12,176 --> 01:31:13,636
No. It is for you.

685
01:31:20,312 --> 01:31:21,459
Adios, Django.
