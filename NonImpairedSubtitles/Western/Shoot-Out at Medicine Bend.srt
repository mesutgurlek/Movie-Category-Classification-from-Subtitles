1
00:01:18,867 --> 00:01:21,181
How much further to
your brother's place, Captain?

2
00:01:21,216 --> 00:01:24,049
My mouth's been watering a week
for a home-cooked meal.

3
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,898
According to this,
just another mile or two.

4
00:01:27,904 --> 00:01:30,281
Hey, Captain. Look-it!

5
00:01:58,425 --> 00:02:00,848
David. Close the windows
in the bedroom.

6
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,492
David! Get your sister in that cot.

7
00:02:29,527 --> 00:02:31,866
Sarah, load the other rifle.

8
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:44,397
Oh, no. Something's wrong with
the ammunition.

9
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:55,751
Here!

10
00:03:11,334 --> 00:03:14,406
Oh, Dan. Dan!

11
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:52,309
No! No!

12
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,432
Oh, Buck!
Dan's dead!

13
00:04:58,494 --> 00:05:00,362
I'm sorry about your brother,
Captain.

14
00:05:00,397 --> 00:05:02,831
We'd have all been killed
if you didn't come.

15
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:04,993
I'm voting we move outta here.

16
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:07,519
Next time, they'll get us,
like they murdered Dan.

17
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:09,612
Indians didn't murder my brother.

18
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:11,636
- It was this.
- What do you mean?

19
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:14,640
Sarah said Dan
had the jump on that Indian.

20
00:05:23,953 --> 00:05:26,911
Ammunition like this, a man'd be
better off throwing rocks.

21
00:05:26,946 --> 00:05:29,292
Yeah.

22
00:05:36,172 --> 00:05:39,128
I never saw no powder
that wouldn't burn.

23
00:05:39,163 --> 00:05:41,599
You would if you used kindling.
That's coal dust.

24
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:44,000
Anybody who'd sell powder
like this oughta be shot.

25
00:05:44,035 --> 00:05:47,914
Where'd you buy these shells, rifles
and tin ploughs in back?

26
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:50,529
Why uh... in Medicine Bend.

27
00:05:50,564 --> 00:05:52,530
That's where your murderers are.

28
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:54,664
Tomorrow, that's where we're heading.

29
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:57,679
- What'll happen to us?
- We'll leave you our rifles.

30
00:05:57,714 --> 00:06:00,655
We'll bring back new supplies.
Good supplies.

31
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,382
My brother was always writing about
this place, so...

32
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:06,887
when me and my friends got mustered
out, we said it'd be good enough for us.

33
00:06:06,922 --> 00:06:09,028
- We'll be back.
- It won't be easy getting back.

34
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:11,051
You might run into trouble.

35
00:06:11,285 --> 00:06:13,630
That's what we're counting on.

36
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:26,088
- Mr. Rittenhouse?
- Here's $20 and my watch.

37
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:29,655
- That oughta get us a gun that'll work
- and some gunpowder.

38
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,081
Won't get much more.

39
00:06:32,996 --> 00:06:35,169
This'll buy the rest.
It's solid gold.

40
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:37,482
All right. What else do you need?

41
00:06:37,517 --> 00:06:40,521
Seed corn... gopher poison.

42
00:06:40,556 --> 00:06:43,423
And a couple of ploughshares.
That about it, Amy?

43
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,689
- That's about it.
- You got it, Will?

44
00:06:45,724 --> 00:06:49,098
- Right.
- I'd like a new rifle.

45
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:51,118
Besides these supplies,

46
00:06:51,153 --> 00:06:54,441
maybe you can get some more folks
to come out and join us, Captain.

47
00:06:54,476 --> 00:06:56,782
There's room in this valley
for a thousand.

48
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,795
I'll do all I can.

49
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,000
The main thing is,
you get back with the goods.

50
00:07:01,035 --> 00:07:04,186
Don't turn your back
on those thieves in Medicine Bend.

51
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:07,175
If you're done, we'd better move.

52
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,697
Buck?

53
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,032
Take this.

54
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,069
It was your mother's.

55
00:07:21,463 --> 00:07:23,886
Dan would want you to use it.

56
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:27,674
What do you want me to buy with it?

57
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:31,839
- Whatever you think we need.
- Some rock candy, Uncle Buck?

58
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:35,248
Put it down, Will.
Household goods for Mrs. Dan Devlin.

59
00:07:35,283 --> 00:07:37,229
50 cents of rock candy
for David Devlin.

60
00:07:37,264 --> 00:07:41,075
And $180 towards the general fund
from ex-Captain Buck Devlin.

61
00:07:42,257 --> 00:07:44,634
If you want a home,
you gotta pay for it.

62
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,192
Well, Sergeant?

63
00:07:48,227 --> 00:07:52,186
$107 mustering outpay,
ex-Sergeant John Maitland.

64
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,889
Well, Private?

65
00:07:57,331 --> 00:07:59,686
$72 and 86 cents.

66
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:02,733
From ex-Private Wilbur Clegg.

67
00:08:16,717 --> 00:08:18,912
- Be careful, Buck.
- Good luck, Captain Devlin!

68
00:08:18,947 --> 00:08:21,272
- We'll be waiting for you!
- God bless you, Captain.

69
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:42,554
Whoa!

70
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:46,275
We might as well camp here. That'll
put us in Medicine Bend tomorrow.

71
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,320
You know what I'm gonna do
the minute we get in?

72
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:50,433
No. What are you gonna do?

73
00:08:50,468 --> 00:08:53,835
I'm gonna walk down the main street
so some of the girls can
take a look at me.

74
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,058
- Some of 'em?
- Well, make it all of 'em.

75
00:08:56,093 --> 00:08:57,482
I oughta be fair about it.

76
00:09:21,614 --> 00:09:23,773
Hey! Stop it! Come back!

77
00:09:23,808 --> 00:09:25,992
They're stealing our clothes!

78
00:09:44,574 --> 00:09:47,511
What was it you said you were gonna
do when we hit town, Johnny?

79
00:09:47,849 --> 00:09:52,043
He was gonna walk up and down Main St.
and let all the girls look at him!

80
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:54,802
It's gonna come as
quite a surprise to 'em!

81
00:09:58,103 --> 00:10:02,858
'King Nebuchadnezzar came near the
mouth of the burning, fiery furnace

82
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,940
and spake and said...

83
00:10:04,975 --> 00:10:08,757
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego...

84
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:12,539
ye servants of the great, high God,

85
00:10:12,574 --> 00:10:15,811
come forth... come hither. '

86
00:10:15,846 --> 00:10:19,049
Come forth, come hither.

87
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,655
'And these three men... '

88
00:10:23,813 --> 00:10:29,115
Brothers? This might be
one of the most fruitful sermons
I've ever preached.

89
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,798
Good day, brothers.

90
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,746
Good day.

91
00:10:38,781 --> 00:10:40,775
And peace be unto thou, brothers.

92
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,174
Sorry to break up your meeting.

93
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,539
Thee hath been set upon by thieves?

94
00:10:45,574 --> 00:10:47,539
Took everything we had.

95
00:10:47,574 --> 00:10:50,020
It is an affliction of the times.

96
00:10:50,055 --> 00:10:52,031
We too have been robbed.

97
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:55,052
Only an hour ago. By three soldiers.

98
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:58,739
We're the soldiers, brother.
They were wearing our uniforms.

99
00:10:58,774 --> 00:11:02,736
- Did you lose much?
- Several horses, our small savings.

100
00:11:02,771 --> 00:11:05,562
- Then you're going back
to Medicine Bend.
- No.

101
00:11:05,597 --> 00:11:08,468
We have put ourselves
in the Lord's hands,

102
00:11:08,503 --> 00:11:10,965
and decided to continue west.

103
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:14,562
I'm afraid we'll need a little more
than the Lord's help.

104
00:11:14,597 --> 00:11:17,104
Thou art welcome to what we have.

105
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:18,708
Prudence.

106
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:20,649
Yes, Brother.

107
00:11:20,684 --> 00:11:22,895
Be thou the Samaritan woman.

108
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,106
Find garments for our friends.

109
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:27,469
This way, friends.

110
00:11:47,275 --> 00:11:49,451
Hey. This is quite a place.

111
00:11:49,486 --> 00:11:51,589
What do we do now, Captain?

112
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:54,752
Look up the sheriff
and try to get our money back.

113
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,062
Hello, boys. Come on in
and have a drink on the house.

114
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,416
- That's for mel
- Me, too!
- We thank thee.

115
00:12:04,451 --> 00:12:06,921
But we must refuse thy kind offer.

116
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:11,564
We haven't a dime between us
and you turn down a free drink?

117
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:13,401
Those are orders, Sergeant.

118
00:12:16,054 --> 00:12:18,727
Pardon me. Could you tell us where
the sheriff's office is?

119
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:20,768
- In there.
- Thank you.

120
00:12:20,803 --> 00:12:23,545
But the sheriff, uh... he's in there.

121
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,289
- In the saloon.
- Oh.

122
00:12:32,302 --> 00:12:34,759
Have a look, boys.

123
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:37,917
- That's your horse, Captain.
- Yeah.

124
00:12:37,952 --> 00:12:40,785
But there's nothing we can do
till we find out who's riding it.

125
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,924
Let's go inside.
But remember - no drinking.

126
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,984
- Just a little one?
- Not in these clothes.

127
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:48,307
Nobody knows we're not Brethren.
Keep it that way till we look around.

128
00:12:48,342 --> 00:12:51,009
Do we have to talk like 'em?
That thee and thou stuff.

129
00:12:51,044 --> 00:12:53,677
Yes. Thee has to talk like them -
and don't forget it.

130
00:12:53,712 --> 00:12:56,352
If I'd known about this,
I'd have re-enlisted.

131
00:12:58,832 --> 00:13:01,321
Well, if it isn't High,
Wide and Handsome again?

132
00:13:01,356 --> 00:13:04,441
- Back for the free drinks?
- Yes, ma'am, if the offer's still open.

133
00:13:04,476 --> 00:13:07,527
- It's open.
- Would thee care to join us
in a glass of buttermilk?

134
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:09,896
- Buttermilk?
- Buttermilk.

135
00:13:10,872 --> 00:13:13,261
Why not?

136
00:13:19,804 --> 00:13:22,686
- Three buttermilks, Dutchy.
- Buttermilks?

137
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:25,718
- That's what I said.
- I thought thee were joining us.

138
00:13:25,912 --> 00:13:29,476
I'll wait.
Maybe your tastes will change.

139
00:13:29,511 --> 00:13:31,060
Well, come on.

140
00:13:31,095 --> 00:13:33,408
You know I don't keep buttermilk
in here, Nell.

141
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:36,571
Well, then, go out and get some.
And keep it on tap.

142
00:13:37,235 --> 00:13:39,647
They might be back.

143
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:48,231
- Front and centre, Sergeant.
- Hey. You'd better buy a cow, Dutchyl

144
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:49,663
Yeah. And don't forget the churn!

145
00:13:50,658 --> 00:13:52,712
When does the preaching start?

146
00:13:52,747 --> 00:13:56,649
- I wanna be sure I leave beforehand.
- Yeah. Before they pass the plate.

147
00:13:56,684 --> 00:13:58,783
A little religion
might be good for thee.

148
00:13:58,818 --> 00:14:00,884
Is the sheriff in here?

149
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:03,591
I'm the sheriff.

150
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:05,647
Open for ten.
What's your trouble?

151
00:14:05,682 --> 00:14:08,579
- I've been robbed.
- Looks more like you were fighting.

152
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,437
- All right. Who did it?
- Three fellas in army uniforms.

153
00:14:11,472 --> 00:14:14,316
We were heading west and
they took our horses and our money.

154
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:16,704
They had masks on.
I couldn't see their faces.

155
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:19,859
- Now, that ain't much help, is it?
- Aren't you gonna look for them?

156
00:14:19,894 --> 00:14:22,979
- Where did you say this happened?
- About three miles east of town.

157
00:14:23,014 --> 00:14:26,321
Well, that's kinda
out of my jurisdiction.

158
00:14:26,356 --> 00:14:28,619
- How many?
- Two.

159
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:32,227
- Three.
- Now, who'd wanna do a thing like that?

160
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:35,136
Probably some Texas men.
They're all rough cubs.

161
00:14:35,137 --> 00:14:37,560
One to the dealer.

162
00:14:38,099 --> 00:14:40,078
Kings up.

163
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:44,581
Three sixes.

164
00:14:46,758 --> 00:14:48,246
You're a Jonah, mister.

165
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:51,147
- Get outta here with your hard luck.
- Now, just wait a minute.

166
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:54,948
- You're supposed to be sheriff here...
- And you want me to arrest somebody?

167
00:14:54,983 --> 00:14:57,019
I want my money back.

168
00:14:57,054 --> 00:14:59,056
All right. Hold up your right hand.

169
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:01,154
Go on. Hold it up.

170
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:05,569
I hereby swear you in as
a deputy sheriff.
Now go out and find your own bandits.

171
00:15:07,913 --> 00:15:10,461
Ain't gonna do us any good
to talk to that sheriff.

172
00:15:10,496 --> 00:15:12,965
Looks that way.

173
00:15:17,062 --> 00:15:19,485
Well, Sergeant?

174
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,972
Well, Private?

175
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,764
I've had enough.
Thanks for the game, boys.

176
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:34,133
Well, thanks for the donation,
Mr. Clark!

177
00:15:35,523 --> 00:15:37,923
- What time are we having dinner, Ep?
- I'll let you know.

178
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,945
Hey, Joe. Take care of those.

179
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,574
But Ep, I get tired
of waiting night after night.

180
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,801
- I get hungry.
- I'll try to be on time.

181
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:56,984
Ed? Take my horse to the stable. I
won't be needing him any more today.

182
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:03,985
- Thee has a fine looking horse.
- He'll do.

183
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,899
Would thee consider selling him?

184
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:08,348
He's not for sale.

185
00:16:08,818 --> 00:16:10,439
Pioneer Emporium.

186
00:16:10,474 --> 00:16:14,092
The last store between here
and Montana Territory.

187
00:16:14,818 --> 00:16:18,037
Quality goods, low prices.
Oh, morning, Mr. Clark.

188
00:16:19,518 --> 00:16:20,729
Keep this sign clean.

189
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:24,091
And sing out We've got a lot
of merchandise to move.

190
00:16:24,126 --> 00:16:26,177
- Nice and loud.
- Yes, sir.

191
00:16:26,212 --> 00:16:28,228
Buy your supplies here, folks!

192
00:16:28,263 --> 00:16:30,723
The Pioneer Emporium!

193
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:33,454
The last store between here
and Montana Territory!

194
00:16:33,489 --> 00:16:36,036
Quality goods at low pricesl

195
00:16:36,071 --> 00:16:38,494
Buy your...
Right in there, Brothers.

196
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:40,918
You can't go wrong at the emporium.

197
00:16:42,538 --> 00:16:44,586
Buy your supplies here, folks!

198
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:46,957
The Pioneer Emporium!

199
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,786
- What's this for?
- You're going to work.

200
00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:55,417
Why me? Because you're big-hearted
and you wanna work to support
your friends.

201
00:16:55,452 --> 00:16:57,731
Why is it I always get
the short end of the deal?

202
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,719
Go on in -
and watch your thees and thous.

203
00:16:59,754 --> 00:17:03,053
Thee may be a civilian now, but thou
sure sounds like my old captain.

204
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,253
Go with him, Johnny.
Maybe they can use two men.

205
00:17:05,288 --> 00:17:08,610
- What are you gonna do?
- Help you spend your wages
when you get paid.

206
00:17:08,645 --> 00:17:12,652
Get your supplies!
Last chance, if you're headed west!

207
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:15,471
Ah. Here you are. Have one.

208
00:17:15,506 --> 00:17:17,721
Buy your supplies here, folks!

209
00:17:17,756 --> 00:17:20,680
This Mr. Clark seems to be
a very important man in this town.

210
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:23,222
Important? He sure is.
See them signs?

211
00:17:23,257 --> 00:17:25,694
Pioneer Saloon...
Ep Clark, proprietor.

212
00:17:25,729 --> 00:17:28,093
Pioneer Hotel... Ep Clark, proprietor.

213
00:17:28,128 --> 00:17:30,783
Pioneer restaurant...
Ep Clark, proprietor.

214
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:33,798
Anything says Pioneer, that's
Ep Clark. Staying in town long?

215
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,317
We plan to.
Doing a little missionary work.

216
00:17:36,352 --> 00:17:40,288
Missionary? Well, you came
to the right place for it, Brother.

217
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:42,959
Buy your supplies here, folks!

218
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:46,031
The Pioneer!
The home of contented customers!

219
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:49,229
Last chance to spend your money,
if you're headed west.

220
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:12,411
- You want something, mister?
- Yeah. I want my money back!

221
00:18:12,446 --> 00:18:14,755
- For what?
- This harness is no darn good!

222
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,702
Must've been made out of paper.
That's your bad luck, mister.

223
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:19,701
What's the trouble, Clyde?

224
00:18:19,736 --> 00:18:22,887
He wants his money back
on a set of harness.

225
00:18:23,695 --> 00:18:26,084
Let me see that.

226
00:18:28,914 --> 00:18:31,076
- I didn't sell you this.
- Well, you sure did.

227
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,997
The Pioneer sells nothing
but top quality merchandise.

228
00:18:34,032 --> 00:18:36,845
You must've bought this stuff
over at Harold Jones's.

229
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,270
I couldn't have. You ran him
out of business six months ago!

230
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,978
Give him another set of harness,
Clyde.

231
00:18:53,676 --> 00:18:56,648
- I guess you'll do.
- What does thee want us to do first?

232
00:18:56,683 --> 00:18:59,586
- What do you mean, 'us'?
- Oh, we always work together.

233
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:03,022
He's not very bright. I do
the thinking and he does the lifting.

234
00:19:03,057 --> 00:19:05,027
We don't need two men.

235
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:07,417
Besides, on this job,
you don't have to be bright.

236
00:19:07,452 --> 00:19:09,468
Oh, it won't cost thee any more.

237
00:19:09,503 --> 00:19:12,863
The two of you are willing to work
for the price of one?

238
00:19:12,898 --> 00:19:16,223
Yes, sir. It's my mission in life
to watch over my brother.

239
00:19:16,258 --> 00:19:18,261
Who watches over you?

240
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:20,334
The Lord watcheth over us all.

241
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:22,747
Well, he's gonna have
some help from me.

242
00:19:22,782 --> 00:19:25,125
Get these empty crates out back
and uh...

243
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,366
start sweeping up.

244
00:19:40,381 --> 00:19:42,476
- Something I can do
to help you ladies?
- Yes.

245
00:19:42,511 --> 00:19:44,681
I'd like to see
some bleached muslin, please.

246
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,851
Well, bleached muslin's
right here, ma'am.

247
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:49,108
- Oh.
- 60 cents a yard.

248
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:52,234
60 cents a yard for muslin?

249
00:19:52,269 --> 00:19:54,902
You won't find any cheaper
this side of St Louis.

250
00:19:54,937 --> 00:19:58,225
I'd have got a better grade
at Elam King's for 40 cents a yard.

251
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,921
Elam King's never undersold us yet,
ma'am.

252
00:20:00,956 --> 00:20:02,942
Well, he has now!

253
00:20:02,977 --> 00:20:05,344
Come, Dora.

254
00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:18,406
- Clyde!
- Yeah?

255
00:20:18,441 --> 00:20:21,251
Let's you and I take a little walk
over to Elam King's.

256
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,329
Opi?

257
00:20:23,364 --> 00:20:25,719
- Opi, keep an eye on the front.
- All right.

258
00:21:04,146 --> 00:21:06,603
Afternoon, Miss Priscilla, Mr. King.

259
00:21:06,638 --> 00:21:08,217
Mr. Sanders.

260
00:21:08,252 --> 00:21:11,335
Heard you folks have a real fine
grade of muslin for sale here.

261
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,651
I'd like to see some of it.

262
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,434
Clyde, what do you think
of this muslin, huh?

263
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,816
- Do you think it's
as good as our muslin?
- No.

264
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:47,921
- This stuff's dirty.
- Yeah.

265
00:21:47,956 --> 00:21:50,202
It sure is.

266
00:21:51,078 --> 00:21:53,863
How come you're trying to sell
dirty muslin, King?

267
00:21:53,898 --> 00:21:57,618
If you wanna stay in business, you're
gonna have to change your methods.

268
00:21:57,653 --> 00:21:59,902
You might lose all your customers.

269
00:22:00,642 --> 00:22:02,576
You haven't got too many, as it is.

270
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:04,798
Hey, Rafe.

271
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,370
This can's got a hole in it.

272
00:22:07,405 --> 00:22:09,321
It has.

273
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:16,541
Looks like there's something wrong
with everything around here.

274
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:20,645
That's funny.

275
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,581
Sugar's got a coal oil smell to it.

276
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,590
What kind of a store
are you running, King?

277
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:32,040
I'm gonna bill you
for everything you've spoiled.

278
00:22:32,075 --> 00:22:34,680
And you'll pay it, too.
Even if I have to take you to court.

279
00:22:34,715 --> 00:22:36,759
- You are going to pay!
- Yeah?

280
00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:43,897
You add that crate of eggs
to the bill, hm?

281
00:22:44,492 --> 00:22:47,347
Now, listen, King.
We sell muslin too.

282
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,403
Clean muslin for 60 cents a yard.

283
00:22:49,438 --> 00:22:51,220
I'd advise you to charge 70 cents.

284
00:22:51,255 --> 00:22:53,642
70 cents, Mr. King.

285
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,925
If I were thee,
I'd pay the bill right now.

286
00:23:00,616 --> 00:23:02,982
If I were thee, I'd get outta my way.

287
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,029
I said, get outta my...

288
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:12,964
What are you trying to do?

289
00:23:17,084 --> 00:23:19,050
I beg your pardon!

290
00:23:19,085 --> 00:23:22,168
Get off. Leave me alone, will you?

291
00:23:25,516 --> 00:23:28,974
Let's go, Clyde. Remember what
I said about that muslin, Mr. King.

292
00:23:37,727 --> 00:23:40,719
Mr. King?
I hope this takes care of the damage.

293
00:23:45,003 --> 00:23:47,030
You're sure a welcome sight.

294
00:23:47,065 --> 00:23:49,803
The Lord taketh away
and the Lord giveth.

295
00:23:50,082 --> 00:23:52,468
You don't know how
grateful we are, Brother.

296
00:23:52,503 --> 00:23:54,271
Do they visit thee like this often?

297
00:23:54,306 --> 00:23:56,327
The second time this month.

298
00:23:56,362 --> 00:24:00,071
He's trying to drive us clear out
of business, the way he's done
to the others.

299
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:05,019
Why isn't something done about it?
- Well, nothing can be done.

300
00:24:05,054 --> 00:24:08,649
Clark's got the sheriff, the mayor
and half the folk in town
scared to death.

301
00:24:08,684 --> 00:24:11,860
Tell me.
Why do people patronise Clark?

302
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:15,535
Oh, he undersells everybody
because he handles shoddy goods.

303
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,085
- You just get in town?
- A short time ago.

304
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,560
- You heading west?
- As soon as possible.

305
00:24:20,595 --> 00:24:24,281
Then I ought to warn you
about the robberies that have
been taking place.

306
00:24:24,316 --> 00:24:26,638
- Have there been many?
- Plenty of 'em.

307
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:29,449
Settlers on their way to Montana.
And they're still here.

308
00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:32,009
They borrowed money
from back east and...

309
00:24:32,044 --> 00:24:34,350
pawned their valuables
and gave it to me to invest

310
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:37,695
in a wagon train load of supplies
I've got coming in from St Louis.

311
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,219
- Uncle Elam, it's a secret.
- Oh, that's all right.

312
00:24:40,254 --> 00:24:42,306
I think we can trust the Brother.

313
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:46,357
We don't want it known.
The shipment might be stopped
before it gets to Medicine Bend.

314
00:24:46,392 --> 00:24:48,625
Might not the thieves rob it
when it leaves town?

315
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:53,415
It's not likely.
By then, everybody'll have
good guns, and plenty of 'em.

316
00:24:55,154 --> 00:24:57,941
Does thee think I could share
in this worthy enterprise?

317
00:24:57,976 --> 00:24:59,301
Uncle Elam?

318
00:25:01,432 --> 00:25:03,650
Excuse me.

319
00:25:10,067 --> 00:25:12,234
Wouldn't it be a good idea if...

320
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:15,670
I mean, don't you think
it might be possible to...

321
00:25:16,595 --> 00:25:19,814
That is, couldn't we
use somebody else...

322
00:25:27,806 --> 00:25:29,929
Sure was nice of Mr. King
to give you a job

323
00:25:29,964 --> 00:25:32,797
and let us all sleep
up in this nice, warm hayloft.

324
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:35,113
He didn't say anything about
you fellas.

325
00:25:35,148 --> 00:25:39,016
- He didn't say we couldn't.
- Well, just don't start redoing the place.

326
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,291
Say, those two dollars
that Mr. King advanced you.

327
00:25:42,326 --> 00:25:44,314
Are we gonna let 'em get mildewed?

328
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:47,978
Or are we going down to the Pioneer
Saloon for a night of wine,
women and song?

329
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:51,622
- You're staying right here.
- Aw! An hour or so wouldn't hurt.

330
00:25:51,657 --> 00:25:53,745
Maybe we could convert somebody.

331
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:57,409
- Convert 'em to what?
- I've got a couple of ideas on the subject.

332
00:25:57,444 --> 00:25:59,481
All right. Let's take a stroll.

333
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,394
Maybe it won't hurt to get
acquainted with Medicine Bend.

334
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:04,089
- Yee-hoo!
- Yippee!

335
00:26:04,124 --> 00:26:07,821
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
Remember who you're supposed to be.

336
00:26:08,465 --> 00:26:10,689
No smoking, no drinking.

337
00:26:10,724 --> 00:26:12,914
- And no nothing.
- No nothing?

338
00:26:12,949 --> 00:26:15,408
You heard me.

339
00:26:24,611 --> 00:26:27,159
# The other night,
while I was walking

340
00:26:27,194 --> 00:26:28,956
# Underneath the moon

341
00:26:28,991 --> 00:26:31,494
# I overheard two lovers talking

342
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:34,596
# About their honeymoon

343
00:26:34,631 --> 00:26:37,619
# Honeymoon
Honeymoon

344
00:26:37,654 --> 00:26:41,488
# He said, oh, my darling,
we'll be married soon

345
00:26:41,523 --> 00:26:43,381
# If you will

346
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:45,202
# Kiss me quick

347
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:48,506
# And leave me never

348
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:51,775
# Never let me go

349
00:26:52,506 --> 00:26:56,135
# Quickly, darling, say you love me

350
00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:00,127
# For I love you so

351
00:27:02,976 --> 00:27:05,627
# She said, will you love me always

352
00:27:05,662 --> 00:27:07,151
# If I kiss you so?

353
00:27:07,186 --> 00:27:09,504
# And never roam and love another

354
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:11,549
- # How am I to know? #
- Gee, she can sing, too!

355
00:27:11,584 --> 00:27:14,678
- What do you mean, too?
- Well, stands to reason
she can do other things.

356
00:27:14,713 --> 00:27:16,880
Like sewing or knitting.

357
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:19,048
Thee is not finding out!

358
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:21,890
# Well, he said...

359
00:27:21,925 --> 00:27:25,374
# Kiss me quick and you'll discover

360
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:28,970
- # Why I'll never roam... #
- Don't tell me. I know.

361
00:27:30,325 --> 00:27:34,615
# I could never love another

362
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:38,905
# Darlin', don't you know?

363
00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:43,134
# She kissed him
and the moon exploded

364
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:44,940
# Like a big balloon

365
00:27:44,975 --> 00:27:47,432
# Before they knew it,
they were married

366
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:49,086
# And on their honeymoon

367
00:27:49,121 --> 00:27:51,368
- # Honeymoon
- Honeymoon

368
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,570
- # Honeymoon
- Honeymoon

369
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:57,371
# They were married
and upon their honeymoon

370
00:27:57,406 --> 00:27:59,407
# Now she says

371
00:27:59,442 --> 00:28:01,367
# Kiss me quick

372
00:28:01,402 --> 00:28:04,493
# And leave me never

373
00:28:04,528 --> 00:28:07,584
# Never let me go

374
00:28:08,156 --> 00:28:12,035
# Quickly, darling, say you love me

375
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:18,981
# For I love you so #

376
00:28:24,144 --> 00:28:26,556
Come on. Come on!

377
00:28:38,855 --> 00:28:40,874
Do you like it that way, Brother?

378
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:45,175
Oh, yes, sir. The milk removes
the evil fire from the spirits.

379
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:48,678
Yeah? Well, have some more.

380
00:28:56,892 --> 00:28:58,803
I thought thee
didn't like buttermilk.

381
00:28:58,838 --> 00:29:01,145
Must be getting used to it.

382
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:08,259
Well, I see you're catching on fast.

383
00:29:08,294 --> 00:29:10,771
You earn your wages
at the Pioneer Emporium,

384
00:29:10,806 --> 00:29:13,354
- spend 'em here at the Pioneer Saloon.
- Yes, sir!

385
00:29:13,389 --> 00:29:15,734
Have a good time.

386
00:29:17,981 --> 00:29:20,666
Do you think we got him fooled
in these get-ups, Captain?

387
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:23,413
Not sure.

388
00:29:27,984 --> 00:29:30,179
Well, hello.
You boys enjoying yourselves?

389
00:29:30,214 --> 00:29:32,287
Would you... I mean...

390
00:29:32,322 --> 00:29:34,361
Would thee join us?

391
00:29:34,362 --> 00:29:37,525
I don't get a cut on anything
weaker than sarsaparilla.

392
00:29:38,947 --> 00:29:40,887
- Something wrong?
- Hm?

393
00:29:40,922 --> 00:29:44,005
Oh, no. I... I was just
admiring thy attire.

394
00:29:44,807 --> 00:29:47,492
That's a little surprising,
coming from you, Brother.

395
00:29:47,527 --> 00:29:50,206
You'd better take it easy
on that buttermilk!

396
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,929
Give us a couple of shots, Dutchy.
I'm buying.

397
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,900
My wallet.

398
00:30:00,935 --> 00:30:04,416
- What happened to my wallet?
- That's OK. I'll get the drinks.

399
00:30:05,457 --> 00:30:08,153
What are you doing with my wallet,
Clyde?!

400
00:30:08,945 --> 00:30:11,718
I had $200 in this!

401
00:30:11,753 --> 00:30:14,492
I don't know now it got there,
honest, Rafe!

402
00:30:16,665 --> 00:30:19,133
Very funny!

403
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:25,452
# Kiss me quick and never leave me

404
00:30:25,487 --> 00:30:27,673
# Never let me go

405
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:29,816
Let me smell this.

406
00:30:29,851 --> 00:30:33,639
- #... on my honeymoon #
- Let's get him out of here.

407
00:30:34,243 --> 00:30:36,598
# Honeymoon!

408
00:30:37,397 --> 00:30:39,718
# Honeymoon!

409
00:30:41,997 --> 00:30:44,097
# Kiss me slow
and hold me tender... #

410
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:46,598
- Get him back to the hayloft.
- Ain't you coming with us?

411
00:30:46,677 --> 00:30:48,966
Not yet. I got a little
business to take care of.

412
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:52,357
- I'll take him home and come back.
- You'll take him home and stay there.

413
00:30:53,283 --> 00:30:56,423
- Yes, sir.
- # Honeymoon, honeymoon... #

414
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:58,305
Shut up!

415
00:33:45,802 --> 00:33:47,975
- No need to be afraid, ma'am.
- Get outta here!

416
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:51,264
Before I start screaming.
And I can scream real loud.

417
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:53,207
- You wouldn't do that.
- Oh, wouldn't -

418
00:34:32,462 --> 00:34:34,416
- Morning, Mr. Clark.
- Morning.

419
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:01,743
Walters! What's the meaning of this?

420
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,896
If I knew, I'd tell you.

421
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:08,634
Sheriff!

422
00:35:08,785 --> 00:35:11,554
Well, don't stand there!
Cut me down!

423
00:35:12,213 --> 00:35:13,456
Hurry up!

424
00:35:16,373 --> 00:35:18,165
What happened, Rafe?

425
00:35:21,582 --> 00:35:23,639
Yoo-hoo! You up yet, honey?

426
00:35:24,482 --> 00:35:27,699
Land of Goshen!
My land!

427
00:35:27,801 --> 00:35:29,534
What are you doing this way?

428
00:35:29,581 --> 00:35:32,060
I always sleep like this!

429
00:35:34,852 --> 00:35:37,889
I don't get it. There I was, walking
peaceful-like down the street

430
00:35:37,924 --> 00:35:39,732
and somebody grabs me round the neck-

431
00:35:39,767 --> 00:35:42,372
This big guy hits me over the head
and I'm out $85!

432
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:44,722
Shut up and let me finish.
I'm out $200.

433
00:35:44,757 --> 00:35:48,318
Shut up, both of you! I don't mind
him taking the locket you gave me,

434
00:35:48,353 --> 00:35:50,531
but he tied me up
like a stuffed turkey!

435
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:52,710
Calm down!
Now, calm down, all of you.

436
00:35:53,258 --> 00:35:55,416
Bob Massey'll take care of this.

437
00:35:55,451 --> 00:35:58,108
- Won't you, Bob?
- Hm? Oh, you leave it to me, Ep.

438
00:35:58,143 --> 00:36:00,941
I'll question every man,
woman and child in this town.

439
00:36:00,976 --> 00:36:03,051
May as well start with these two.

440
00:36:03,086 --> 00:36:05,088
Hey, you!

441
00:36:05,123 --> 00:36:07,205
Where were you two last night?

442
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,156
- Sleeping.
- Where?

443
00:36:09,191 --> 00:36:11,587
- King's hayloft.
- King's hayloft!

444
00:36:11,622 --> 00:36:14,750
These two work for you, yet
they're sleeping in King's hayloft.

445
00:36:14,785 --> 00:36:17,186
That doesn't prove anything, Bob.

446
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:20,571
What do you boys know about
a couple of robberies last night

447
00:36:20,606 --> 00:36:22,844
to the tune of almost $300?

448
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:25,953
Why, sir, we know nothing
of such foul deeds.

449
00:36:25,988 --> 00:36:29,028
Thee can search us.
We ain't got a cent on us.

450
00:36:29,063 --> 00:36:31,470
Good morning, gentlemen.

451
00:36:32,644 --> 00:36:36,125
Just heard about last night.
This is a terrible thing. Terrible.

452
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,353
Now, if you ask me,
the thing to do…

453
00:36:38,388 --> 00:36:40,546
- Nobody's asking you, Sam.
- Morning, Ep.

454
00:36:40,547 --> 00:36:42,977
Did either of you boys
get a good look at him?

455
00:36:43,012 --> 00:36:45,537
Well, if they did,
we wouldn't all be standing around.

456
00:36:45,572 --> 00:36:47,403
I saw him.

457
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:50,384
- That is, I...
- Were you robbed too?

458
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:54,291
- You could call it that.
- Oh, well, that's interesting.

459
00:36:54,326 --> 00:36:56,584
What did he look like,
Miss Garrison?

460
00:36:56,619 --> 00:36:58,806
Well, he was tall... and well dressed.

461
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:02,254
He had a black shirt... I can tell
you about the clothes he was wearing.

462
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:04,879
He got 'em right here.
A $40 dollar hat, a black beaver...

463
00:37:04,914 --> 00:37:08,262
Rafe! The mayor
ain't interested in details.

464
00:37:08,862 --> 00:37:11,934
The most important thing
is to post a reward, isn't it, Sam?

465
00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:13,976
Uh, yes.

466
00:37:14,011 --> 00:37:16,836
Well, all right.
As mayor of Medicine Bend,

467
00:37:16,871 --> 00:37:19,662
I hereby proclaim
to offer a reward of... of...

468
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:21,582
- $500.
- Five hun-

469
00:37:21,617 --> 00:37:23,709
Better make it a thousand.

470
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:26,451
$1,000 for the arrest
and conviction of the bandit,

471
00:37:26,486 --> 00:37:29,259
or bandits,
responsible for the outrages

472
00:37:29,294 --> 00:37:31,808
committed against the peace…
That's enough, Sam.

473
00:37:31,843 --> 00:37:33,859
We all got the idea.

474
00:37:33,894 --> 00:37:36,374
Now, you fellas go back to work.

475
00:37:41,571 --> 00:37:43,597
- Can you see anything?
- Nah.

476
00:37:43,632 --> 00:37:46,013
It's as black in there
as the inside of a buffalo.

477
00:37:46,048 --> 00:37:49,632
Gimme a knife. I'm gonna
whittle this crack a little wider.

478
00:37:52,783 --> 00:37:54,392
Where'd that come from?

479
00:37:54,427 --> 00:37:58,147
Out of my pocket. You sure you
ain't wearing somebody else's pants?

480
00:37:58,182 --> 00:38:00,378
You know I'm wearing
somebody else's pants.

481
00:38:00,413 --> 00:38:02,365
Uh-oh.

482
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,481
Where'd that come from?

483
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:06,943
And you said, 'They can search us. '

484
00:38:06,978 --> 00:38:09,776
Yeah. Well, if they had,
we'd both be looking up a rope.

485
00:38:12,492 --> 00:38:14,518
- You don't think the captain -
- Shh!

486
00:38:14,553 --> 00:38:16,942
Gimme that hammer.
I'm gonna bust this lock.

487
00:38:28,915 --> 00:38:31,566
Go on in. I'll keep watch.

488
00:38:40,227 --> 00:38:42,320
- You find something?
- We just hit pay dirt.

489
00:38:42,355 --> 00:38:44,140
All our uniforms are here.

490
00:38:44,175 --> 00:38:45,885
Maitland?

491
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,263
Clegg? Where are you?

492
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:53,870
Was you calling me, Mr. Sanders?

493
00:38:53,905 --> 00:38:57,523
Yeah. I want you to... How come
you said, 'Was YOU calling me?'

494
00:38:57,558 --> 00:38:59,567
Well, it was you, wasn't it?

495
00:38:59,602 --> 00:39:02,093
I thought all you Brethren
said 'thee' for you.

496
00:39:02,128 --> 00:39:04,147
Oh, thee is right.

497
00:39:04,182 --> 00:39:06,126
Sometimes we forget.

498
00:39:06,161 --> 00:39:09,278
- How long have you been in the Brethren?
- Not very long.

499
00:39:10,382 --> 00:39:14,034
Sack up four 50lb bags
of brown sugar and get them
on the loading platform.

500
00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:16,314
Yes, sir.

501
00:39:21,706 --> 00:39:24,539
Have you had any word about
that wagon train yet, Miss King?

502
00:39:24,574 --> 00:39:26,769
- Our money arrived today.
- Nothing definite.

503
00:39:26,804 --> 00:39:28,923
- But it should be here soon.
- I sure hope so.

504
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:31,637
Our party's getting jumpy,
just sitting around waiting.

505
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:34,316
- We oughta be in Montana by now.
- We'll let you know,

506
00:39:34,351 --> 00:39:36,240
just as soon as
the new supplies arrive.

507
00:39:36,275 --> 00:39:38,655
Thank you, Miss King.

508
00:39:39,271 --> 00:39:42,195
- Sounds like you got robbed too, mister.
- Yeah, that's right.

509
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,489
How much did they take you for?

510
00:39:44,524 --> 00:39:46,708
Every cent we had. Over $4,000.

511
00:39:46,743 --> 00:39:49,291
We had to send back east
for more money to go on.

512
00:39:49,326 --> 00:39:51,558
Same thing happened to my outfit.

513
00:39:52,335 --> 00:39:55,623
Oh, I'd like to leave
this list of things we need, Miss.

514
00:39:55,658 --> 00:39:59,864
When our money comes, I'll...
By the way, my name's Grainger.

515
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:02,299
We'll do our best
to fill your order, Mr. Grainger.

516
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:04,585
Thank you.

517
00:40:11,515 --> 00:40:14,882
You can help me check these lists
against the things we have on order.

518
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:16,784
Yes, ma'am.

519
00:40:16,819 --> 00:40:19,526
Four barrels of hard wheat
bolted flour.

520
00:40:19,561 --> 00:40:21,630
What's bolted flour?

521
00:40:21,665 --> 00:40:24,566
Flour that's sifted
through fine mesh cloth.

522
00:40:24,601 --> 00:40:26,833
Oh.

523
00:40:27,529 --> 00:40:29,548
Fifty flitches of bacon, lean.

524
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:31,960
Bacon, lean.

525
00:40:32,881 --> 00:40:34,990
50 plates of sow bosom.

526
00:40:35,025 --> 00:40:37,880
Sow bosom? You mean sow belly.

527
00:40:38,671 --> 00:40:41,811
I prefer sow bosom.
It's more refined.

528
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,752
50 plates of sow bosom.

529
00:40:49,026 --> 00:40:50,081
Priscilla!

530
00:40:50,426 --> 00:40:52,570
Is something wrong, Uncle?

531
00:40:52,605 --> 00:40:56,052
No. I think that something
might be right, for a change.

532
00:40:58,776 --> 00:40:59,679
I don't understand.

533
00:40:59,714 --> 00:41:02,782
Somebody broke into Ep Clark's store
and stole a lot of stuff.

534
00:41:02,817 --> 00:41:06,719
But that ain't all. He tied up Clyde
Walters in a whole bolt of muslin.

535
00:41:06,754 --> 00:41:08,592
Wrapped him up
like an Egyptian mummy.

536
00:41:08,627 --> 00:41:11,472
And then he hung Rafe Sanders
to a pole like a side of beef.

537
00:41:11,507 --> 00:41:14,274
Serves him right, if you ask me.
Did anyone see the man?

538
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:17,437
No. Not his face. But that Garrison
woman said he was a big, tall man

539
00:41:17,472 --> 00:41:20,036
with dark clothes and
a light handkerchief to his face.

540
00:41:20,037 --> 00:41:22,192
- Said he came in by the window.
- Nell Garrison?

541
00:41:22,227 --> 00:41:24,809
Yep. He robbed her too.
He just took her jewellery.

542
00:41:24,844 --> 00:41:26,777
At least, that's what she says.

543
00:41:26,812 --> 00:41:29,519
You don't know what it means
to this town to have somebody

544
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:31,802
with enough nerve
to stand up to Ep Clark.

545
00:41:31,837 --> 00:41:34,152
Thievery and violence
are against our creed.

546
00:41:34,187 --> 00:41:36,433
Well, ordinarily,
it's against mine too.

547
00:41:36,468 --> 00:41:39,015
But in this case,
it seems like poetic justice.

548
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:43,441
But I'd sure hate to be that thief
if Clark ever gets his hands on him.

549
00:41:44,225 --> 00:41:46,163
Let me see.

550
00:41:46,198 --> 00:41:47,862
50 plates of sow bosom.

551
00:41:47,897 --> 00:41:50,946
What sort of work did you do
before you came here?

552
00:41:50,981 --> 00:41:53,109
- I was a soldier.
- A soldier?

553
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:56,955
Mm-hm. I thought you just said
that violence was against your creed.

554
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,843
Sometimes you uh...
have to make an exception.

555
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:04,189
- 50 plates of sow...
- Did you belong to the brotherhood
before you joined the army?

556
00:42:04,224 --> 00:42:06,398
- No.
- Well, what made you join afterward?

557
00:42:06,472 --> 00:42:09,098
- Several people.
- Friends of yours?

558
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:10,869
Not exactly.

559
00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:14,931
- 50 plates...
- I'm very curious about your
religion, Mr. Devlin.

560
00:42:15,714 --> 00:42:17,944
I don't understand it
very well myself.

561
00:42:17,979 --> 00:42:20,657
- 50 plates of...
- Would you take me
to the meeting tonight?

562
00:42:20,692 --> 00:42:23,336
- What meeting?
- Your brotherhood has a church here.

563
00:42:23,371 --> 00:42:25,371
- Oh.
- Well, didn't you know?

564
00:42:25,406 --> 00:42:28,648
- Oh, yes. Of course.
- You may call for me at seven.

565
00:42:29,703 --> 00:42:32,513
I'll have my friends call for thee.
I won't be going tonight.

566
00:42:32,548 --> 00:42:36,144
This is my...
my evening for meditation.

567
00:43:05,492 --> 00:43:08,129
- What's the matter?
- Captain, we discovered something.

568
00:43:08,164 --> 00:43:10,962
Our uniforms. We found 'em
in a back room in Clark's store.

569
00:43:10,997 --> 00:43:13,319
Yeah. What do we do about it?

570
00:43:16,887 --> 00:43:18,967
- Nothing now. Can you get 'em out?
- Sure.

571
00:43:19,002 --> 00:43:22,119
We could put 'em on the loading
platform and come back at night.

572
00:43:22,154 --> 00:43:24,240
You know what I think, Captain?

573
00:43:24,275 --> 00:43:27,984
They've been using our uniforms
as a disguise to hold up
these wagon trains.

574
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:31,891
- Don't you think he's thought of that?
- It's giving the army a bad name.

575
00:43:36,654 --> 00:43:40,340
Company, halt. Hold the formation,
but let me do the talking.

576
00:43:41,523 --> 00:43:43,242
Peace go with thee.

577
00:43:43,815 --> 00:43:45,431
Peace go with thee.

578
00:43:46,469 --> 00:43:48,834
Thee must be strangers in the town.

579
00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:51,200
I've not seen thee in the church.

580
00:43:51,918 --> 00:43:53,936
Can a man only worship in a church?

581
00:43:53,971 --> 00:43:56,747
Can a church exist
without worshippers?

582
00:43:57,459 --> 00:44:01,111
My name is Brother Abraham. If thee
have need of help, call upon me.

583
00:44:01,146 --> 00:44:04,440
I am Brother Devlin.
My friends and I thank thee.

584
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,695
Good day.

585
00:44:08,959 --> 00:44:12,404
Didn't thee think them
rather strange, Brother Abraham?

586
00:44:12,439 --> 00:44:15,850
Question not a man
until thee has examined his actions

587
00:44:15,885 --> 00:44:18,220
and found them sinful.

588
00:44:40,914 --> 00:44:45,495
Ah. Welcome back!

589
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:47,540
For doing two men's work.

590
00:44:47,575 --> 00:44:50,396
You don't do one man's work
between the both of you!

591
00:44:54,073 --> 00:44:56,730
- Maybe that'll keep you busy for a while.
- Hey, wait a min...

592
00:44:56,765 --> 00:45:00,201
From now on, don't leave the store
unless I tell you to. Understand?

593
00:45:00,236 --> 00:45:03,493
Yes, sir.

594
00:45:03,528 --> 00:45:06,247
Comes the day I shed these
peace-loving clothes.

595
00:45:06,282 --> 00:45:08,419
Oh, no, you don't. I saw him first.

596
00:45:08,454 --> 00:45:10,557
Tell you what.
I'll flip you for him.

597
00:45:10,592 --> 00:45:12,917
Heads, I get him.

598
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,989
- Ep, I've been doing some thinking.
- About what?

599
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:30,175
Those two Brothers we hired. And that
friend of theirs - the big fella.

600
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:32,410
I don't think they're
what they say they are.

601
00:45:32,445 --> 00:45:34,698
- What makes you think so?
- Oh, little things.

602
00:45:34,733 --> 00:45:36,913
Like forgetting to say 'thee'
once in a while.

603
00:45:36,948 --> 00:45:40,395
Oh, and their manners. Never seen
Brothers act the way they do.

604
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:42,841
If they're not Brothers,
who do you think they are?

605
00:45:42,876 --> 00:45:44,811
Well, that's just it. I don't know.

606
00:45:44,846 --> 00:45:47,715
Hey. We was never robbed
before the three of 'em hit town.

607
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:50,585
Could be they've got
something to do with that bandit.

608
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,621
Could be, Clyde.

609
00:45:52,656 --> 00:45:54,647
Want me to get rid of 'em?

610
00:45:54,682 --> 00:45:57,549
No. Just keep an eye on 'em
until you're sure.

611
00:45:57,584 --> 00:45:59,478
Ep...

612
00:45:59,513 --> 00:46:01,435
Maybe we could
set a little trap for 'em.

613
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:03,947
Right here in the store.

614
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:08,402
Well... all right.

615
00:46:08,437 --> 00:46:10,554
Never hurts
to find out a thing or two.

616
00:46:10,589 --> 00:46:13,183
Go ahead and see
what you can come up with.

617
00:46:13,218 --> 00:46:15,778
If you need me...
I'll be across the street.

618
00:46:24,762 --> 00:46:26,789
Now what are you thinking?

619
00:46:26,824 --> 00:46:29,304
Do you remember
when Ep bought this place?

620
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:31,245
There was an old well here.

621
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,487
Sure. It's where he keeps his chest,
ain't it?

622
00:46:33,522 --> 00:46:35,897
That's right.

623
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:38,942
Gimme a hand. It's heavy.

624
00:46:47,373 --> 00:46:49,628
What you doing that for?

625
00:46:49,663 --> 00:46:51,883
Well, I'll show you, Clyde.

626
00:46:52,892 --> 00:46:55,634
You uh... you through with
your apple?

627
00:46:58,799 --> 00:47:01,506
That's 30 feet, straight down.

628
00:47:03,318 --> 00:47:05,798
A man could drown real easy in there.

629
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,694
- I don't get it, Rafe.
- Simple, when you think about it.

630
00:47:10,729 --> 00:47:14,389
You wanna catch a rat, you...
you gotta bait the trap.

631
00:47:15,093 --> 00:47:17,104
Oh, I get it.

632
00:47:17,139 --> 00:47:19,482
Now, get that rug back in place.

633
00:47:30,108 --> 00:47:32,059
Maitland? Clegg?

634
00:47:32,094 --> 00:47:34,105
- Thee want something?
- Yeah.

635
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,357
Get these buckets
away from the door.

636
00:47:36,392 --> 00:47:40,112
By the way, Clyde. Don't forget
the lock on that money box is broken.

637
00:47:40,147 --> 00:47:42,896
- Be sure to fix it first thing in the morning.
- Right.

638
00:47:53,429 --> 00:47:54,849
Now, what about that money chest?

639
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:57,880
It's sitting there to be grabbed,
broken lock 'n' all.

640
00:47:58,567 --> 00:48:01,730
That outfit doesn't impress me as
a bunch who would like to get robbed.

641
00:48:01,765 --> 00:48:03,856
- What do you mean by that?
- From what you say,

642
00:48:03,891 --> 00:48:07,372
they've gone to a lot of trouble to
make stealing it easy and let word
get out

643
00:48:07,407 --> 00:48:09,482
- You figure it's some sort of a trap?
- Maybe.

644
00:48:09,517 --> 00:48:11,250
Well, then, Johnny and I
had better go with you.

645
00:48:11,308 --> 00:48:13,051
Uh-uh. You and Johnny
gonna be in church.

646
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:14,552
- In church!
- Yeah, you know.

647
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:16,106
One of those places
with a steeple on it.

648
00:48:16,141 --> 00:48:19,088
- What are we doing there?
- Sitting with a pretty girl.

649
00:48:19,123 --> 00:48:23,196
- Well, that helps a little.
- And listening to a sermon. It'll do you both good.

650
00:48:50,499 --> 00:48:52,537
Brothers and sisters.

651
00:48:52,572 --> 00:48:56,030
It heartens my soul
to stand before thee tonight

652
00:48:56,065 --> 00:48:58,190
and see new faces
in the congregation.

653
00:48:58,225 --> 00:49:00,527
Happy faces.

654
00:49:02,244 --> 00:49:05,202
My text for this evening
is taken from...

655
00:49:05,237 --> 00:49:07,656
Timothy 5.23.

656
00:49:08,275 --> 00:49:10,302
'Drink no longer water,

657
00:49:10,337 --> 00:49:13,488
but take a little wine
for thy stomach's sake. '

658
00:49:13,523 --> 00:49:14,911
Amen!

659
00:51:02,266 --> 00:51:04,564
Ep!

660
00:51:53,428 --> 00:51:55,283
It must be Walters.

661
00:51:59,942 --> 00:52:02,945
Get over to King's and see if
any of those Brothers are missing.

662
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:05,088
I want somebody hung for this.

663
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:07,637
Or you're not gonna be sheriff
any longer.

664
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,891
Mr. Devlin.

665
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:39,206
- You're hurt.
- Oh, it doesn't amount to much.

666
00:52:39,241 --> 00:52:41,579
Come in the kitchen,
where there's warm water.

667
00:52:42,466 --> 00:52:44,923
Come on.

668
00:53:03,608 --> 00:53:05,906
I don't suppose I should ask
what happened to you.

669
00:53:05,941 --> 00:53:08,388
You can,
but I won't guarantee an answer.

670
00:53:13,836 --> 00:53:17,135
A man wearing clothes like yours has
been quite busy around town lately.

671
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:19,221
So I've heard.

672
00:53:19,256 --> 00:53:21,952
Siddown. I'll see what we can do
about that bruise.

673
00:53:26,315 --> 00:53:29,313
Who are you... when you're not
masquerading as a brother?

674
00:53:29,348 --> 00:53:32,311
I've been working for Uncle Sam's
army the past four years.

675
00:53:32,346 --> 00:53:34,624
Mustered out a month ago.

676
00:53:37,705 --> 00:53:39,812
Why the disguise?

677
00:53:39,847 --> 00:53:43,624
Somebody stole everything we had,
including the money of our
entire community.

678
00:53:43,659 --> 00:53:45,249
The Brothers helped us out

679
00:53:45,284 --> 00:53:48,276
When I came to town
and found Clark riding my horse,

680
00:53:48,311 --> 00:53:52,008
I figured it would be just as well
to pass as a Brother for
the time being.

681
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:56,394
The way things are going, I'd say
you'd better keep on passing as one.

682
00:53:57,255 --> 00:54:00,213
This community you mention.
What's is like?

683
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:03,120
Like any other western settlement.

684
00:54:03,155 --> 00:54:05,173
The land's good.

685
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:07,881
It's gonna be a town someday,
perhaps a city.

686
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,848
If we can get
the right sort of people.

687
00:54:10,883 --> 00:54:12,958
I've always wanted to go
farther west.

688
00:54:12,993 --> 00:54:15,528
But I'm afraid Uncle Elam
wouldn't let me go alone.

689
00:54:15,563 --> 00:54:19,226
Of course, if I had a job,
like teaching school, or something...

690
00:54:19,261 --> 00:54:22,036
and... somebody to look out for me...

691
00:54:27,089 --> 00:54:29,213
Who is it?

692
00:54:29,248 --> 00:54:31,465
Sheriff Massey.

693
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,682
Just a minute.

694
00:54:35,399 --> 00:54:37,742
In there.

695
00:54:47,538 --> 00:54:50,602
- What do you want?
- A man was murdered tonight.

696
00:54:50,637 --> 00:54:55,074
And I'm kinda interested in who's
sleeping in your barn, if anybody.

697
00:54:58,372 --> 00:55:00,966
- Where does that door lead?
- My uncle's bedroom.

698
00:55:01,001 --> 00:55:02,982
Oh?

699
00:55:03,672 --> 00:55:05,695
- You can't go in there.
- Why can't I?

700
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:07,925
My uncle's asleep.
I don't want him disturbed.

701
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,032
- Get out of my house.
- Get out of my way.

702
00:55:25,497 --> 00:55:29,115
If you don't mind, Miss King,
I will take a look in your barn.

703
00:56:42,409 --> 00:56:44,380
Our money's back, everybody!

704
00:56:44,415 --> 00:56:46,817
It happened some time last night.
It had to.

705
00:56:46,852 --> 00:56:49,220
How much is there, Vance?
Did you count it?

706
00:56:49,255 --> 00:56:51,672
$3600, my watch,

707
00:56:51,707 --> 00:56:54,197
and most of the jewellery
we were robbed of.

708
00:56:54,287 --> 00:56:56,788
It's a miracle. That's what it is.
A miracle!

709
00:56:56,926 --> 00:56:58,673
You know what's happened?

710
00:56:58,723 --> 00:57:00,748
Why, you too?

711
00:57:00,783 --> 00:57:03,331
Did you find your cash box full
this morning too?

712
00:57:03,366 --> 00:57:05,840
Yep. $4,000 and a lot of jewellery.

713
00:57:05,875 --> 00:57:08,269
Some of it must belong to you folks.

714
00:57:08,304 --> 00:57:10,920
Well, we've got some
that must belong to your outfit.

715
00:57:10,955 --> 00:57:12,999
Come on. I'll show you.

716
00:57:16,216 --> 00:57:19,379
- Thank you for helping me with these.
- It's a pleasure, ma'am.

717
00:57:20,346 --> 00:57:22,792
Sure beats sweeping floors.

718
00:57:24,094 --> 00:57:26,130
Oh. Put those on the table.

719
00:57:26,165 --> 00:57:28,116
No.

720
00:57:28,151 --> 00:57:30,528
Put 'em on the bed.

721
00:57:49,552 --> 00:57:52,407
Seems to me, thee are out of place,
singing in a saloon.

722
00:57:52,442 --> 00:57:55,108
What do you know about
saloon singers?

723
00:57:55,143 --> 00:57:58,783
I've spent quite a lot of time
and money looking into the subject.

724
00:57:58,818 --> 00:58:00,762
Before I was converted, that is.

725
00:58:00,797 --> 00:58:02,874
Have a drink with me?

726
00:58:02,909 --> 00:58:04,912
Well, I...

727
00:58:04,947 --> 00:58:08,155
- No. I... No, thanks.
- You don't mind if I have one?

728
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:10,685
No. Thee go right ahead. I'll watch.

729
00:58:12,153 --> 00:58:14,132
Well, here's to Medicine Bend.

730
00:58:14,167 --> 00:58:16,518
It's quite a place.

731
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:19,212
It'll do for now.

732
00:58:19,247 --> 00:58:21,292
Thee aren't planning on staying?

733
00:58:21,327 --> 00:58:23,966
Not one minute longer
than I have to.

734
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:28,439
Where would thee go if thee left?

735
00:58:28,474 --> 00:58:30,748
It all depends on who I left with.

736
00:58:31,882 --> 00:58:35,283
Guess I'd like to get married
and have a home, like anybody else.

737
00:58:35,965 --> 00:58:40,914
Except, those aren't the kind of
proposals you get working in a place
like The Pioneer Saloon.

738
00:58:42,043 --> 00:58:44,796
- You married?
- Not yet.

739
00:58:45,684 --> 00:58:48,100
You look like a good bet
for somebody.

740
00:58:48,135 --> 00:58:50,516
Quiet, dependable,
handy around the house.

741
00:58:50,551 --> 00:58:52,494
Are thee making fun of me?

742
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,612
Sure I am.

743
00:58:54,647 --> 00:58:57,241
Well. I'm gonna have to
run you out of here now.

744
00:58:57,276 --> 00:58:59,273
I have to get ready and go to work.

745
00:58:59,308 --> 00:59:01,352
Well, I could stay and help.

746
00:59:01,387 --> 00:59:04,595
Oh, thee had better watch thyself,
Brother!

747
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:07,055
I think you're beginning
to backslide.

748
00:59:07,824 --> 00:59:09,872
Thanks again for helping
with the bundles.

749
00:59:09,907 --> 00:59:12,204
Any time.

750
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:48,552
I'm telling you,
they was all three sound asleep.

751
00:59:48,587 --> 00:59:51,574
I can't arrest 'em
without no evidence at all.

752
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:54,636
- Ep!
- Now what do you want?

753
00:59:54,671 --> 00:59:56,978
Those soldier uniforms are gone.

754
00:59:57,013 --> 00:59:59,833
I thought I told you
to keep that storeroom locked.

755
00:59:59,868 --> 01:00:02,610
I did. Somebody broke the lock.
I just noticed it.

756
01:00:02,645 --> 01:00:06,308
Aw, who'd be interested in
a bunch of old military uniforms?

757
01:00:06,343 --> 01:00:08,318
The military! Who else?

758
01:00:08,353 --> 01:00:10,415
Especially the men who owned them.

759
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:13,584
Might just be a perfect fit
for those three Brothers.

760
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:16,713
Now, wait a minute. If they are
in the army, we'd better lay off.

761
01:00:16,748 --> 01:00:18,278
Yeah.

762
01:00:18,313 --> 01:00:21,157
Only trouble is,
how are we gonna know?

763
01:00:23,107 --> 01:00:26,235
Well, I've got just a
dandy way to find out.

764
01:00:41,759 --> 01:00:45,160
Mr. Clark said I should wait
for an answer from thee.

765
01:00:45,794 --> 01:00:48,251
Come in.

766
01:00:49,385 --> 01:00:51,584
So, Mr. Clark wants an answer.

767
01:00:51,619 --> 01:00:53,783
Yes'm. He said I should wait.

768
01:00:55,361 --> 01:00:58,649
It's too early in the morning
to think right. I just got up.

769
01:00:58,684 --> 01:01:00,850
- Well, maybe I'd better come back later.
- Oh, no!

770
01:01:00,885 --> 01:01:03,501
No. I'll be able to collect
my thoughts in a moment.

771
01:01:03,502 --> 01:01:05,914
Won't you sit down?

772
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:15,807
Oh, excuse me!

773
01:01:33,637 --> 01:01:36,686
- No, I...
- Go ahead. I won't tell on you.

774
01:01:40,298 --> 01:01:42,761
Well...
maybe just one won't hurt me.

775
01:01:42,796 --> 01:01:45,186
I always say, drink no longer water,

776
01:01:45,221 --> 01:01:47,860
but take a little wine
for they stomach's sake.

777
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:50,747
Happy days.

778
01:01:53,718 --> 01:01:57,495
Somehow... you're just not
the type... to become a Brother.

779
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:59,543
Oh, well, I didn't use to be.

780
01:01:59,578 --> 01:02:01,622
What did you used to be?

781
01:02:01,657 --> 01:02:03,923
Oh, lots of things.

782
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:12,577
- What's your name?
- Clegg... Priv... Er...

783
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:14,826
I mean, that is, Wilbur Clegg.

784
01:02:14,861 --> 01:02:16,963
Mind if I call you Will?

785
01:02:16,998 --> 01:02:20,001
Oh, no, ma'am. All my friends do.

786
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:23,167
Here's to friendship... Willie.

787
01:02:26,394 --> 01:02:30,886
And there we were, 1,600 Sioux,
ride in the drawer to the right of us.

788
01:02:30,945 --> 01:02:36,620
And old Spotted Dog with 2,000
Apapahoes on that hill.

789
01:02:36,655 --> 01:02:38,713
And here we were.

790
01:02:38,748 --> 01:02:40,755
With a river behind us

791
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:42,979
and that cliff in front of us.

792
01:02:43,014 --> 01:02:45,975
- What happened?
- You won't believe this.

793
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:50,936
The general... the general, he turned
to me and he looked worried.

794
01:02:50,971 --> 01:02:52,896
He turned to me and he says,
'Willie... '

795
01:02:52,931 --> 01:02:54,883
Always called me Willie.

796
01:02:54,918 --> 01:02:57,807
He says, 'Willie? What can we do?'

797
01:02:57,842 --> 01:03:00,697
- And you know what I told him?
- What?

798
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:03,953
Charge!

799
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:06,332
Charge!

800
01:03:06,367 --> 01:03:08,676
Charge!

801
01:03:17,784 --> 01:03:20,435
She's thinking up an answer
to your note, Mr. Clark.

802
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:22,503
- Takes time this early in the morning.
- Well?

803
01:03:22,538 --> 01:03:25,269
5th Cavalry, Troop C, 1st Brigade.

804
01:03:25,304 --> 01:03:27,413
- Troop E!
- Anything else?

805
01:03:27,448 --> 01:03:30,383
They were robbed. They've been
trying to get back what was taken.

806
01:03:30,418 --> 01:03:33,111
- To buy supplies from Elam King.
- Elam King?

807
01:03:33,146 --> 01:03:35,805
He's got a shipment due in any day.
Mostly arms.

808
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:38,210
- Everyone's waiting for it.
- Thanks, Nell.

809
01:03:38,245 --> 01:03:40,581
Get his partners.
Give 'em a fair trial.

810
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:43,097
- Then hang 'em!
- Ep, wait!

811
01:03:43,132 --> 01:03:46,461
You can't hang 'em.
- Don't go soft, Nell.

812
01:03:46,496 --> 01:03:49,158
These men are dangerous.
They killed Clyde Walters.

813
01:03:49,193 --> 01:03:51,210
- Take him in!
- Come on.

814
01:03:51,245 --> 01:03:53,770
- Oh, now, just a minute here.
- Come on!

815
01:03:53,805 --> 01:03:56,202
Do your talking at the trial.

816
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:26,750
- Where's the tall one that works here?
- You mean Brother Devlin?

817
01:04:26,785 --> 01:04:28,924
He's no Brother, and you know it.
Where is he?

818
01:04:28,959 --> 01:04:31,678
- I'm sure he wouldn't be interested.
- He'll be interested.

819
01:04:31,713 --> 01:04:33,769
Unless he wants to hang.

820
01:04:33,804 --> 01:04:36,682
- Hang?
- They already have his friends,
and they're coming here.

821
01:04:36,717 --> 01:04:39,307
- So he'd better start moving.
- I don't believe you.

822
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:41,530
I believe her.

823
01:04:43,336 --> 01:04:45,969
- But why this sudden change of heart?
- That's a long story.

824
01:04:46,004 --> 01:04:49,041
The important thing is, Johnny and
Will'll both be hung by morning

825
01:04:49,076 --> 01:04:51,184
unless they get some help.

826
01:04:51,219 --> 01:04:52,533
Thanks.

827
01:04:56,085 --> 01:04:59,681
Mr. Devlin. How can you help them?
One man against a whole town.

828
01:04:59,716 --> 01:05:03,278
- I don't know yet.
- Well, where can I get in touch with you?

829
01:05:03,897 --> 01:05:06,320
Brother Abraham. We can trust him.

830
01:05:06,924 --> 01:05:09,313
I'll wait for you at the church.

831
01:05:15,419 --> 01:05:17,493
I suppose I should apologise.

832
01:05:17,528 --> 01:05:20,032
- Forget it.
- I'm sorry. You see...

833
01:05:20,067 --> 01:05:24,834
- I thought...
- What everybody else in town thinks?

834
01:05:24,869 --> 01:05:27,776
I don't. I only work for him.
Or, used to.

835
01:05:27,811 --> 01:05:30,939
I've gone along with a lot of things,
but not murder.

836
01:05:30,974 --> 01:05:33,454
You'd better go out the back way.

837
01:05:44,844 --> 01:05:46,854
Yes, Mr. Massey?

838
01:05:46,889 --> 01:05:49,995
I'm looking for that so-called
Brother that works for you.

839
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:52,469
Brother Devlin?
He's not here right now.

840
01:05:52,504 --> 01:05:55,940
- I sent him on an errand.
- Don't try to cover for him, Miss.

841
01:05:55,975 --> 01:05:58,266
He's wanted for murder.

842
01:05:58,968 --> 01:06:02,540
Slade? Go search the hayloft.
I'll take a look in back.

843
01:06:59,565 --> 01:07:02,750
Well, guess you was telling
the truth. Ain't nobody back there.

844
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:04,824
Where does that staircase lead?

845
01:07:04,859 --> 01:07:07,265
Why don't you find out?

846
01:07:08,175 --> 01:07:10,242
Oh, no.

847
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:14,168
So as you can get rid of me
while Devlin makes his escape
from the barn?

848
01:07:20,794 --> 01:07:21,778
Hey!

849
01:07:21,813 --> 01:07:23,929
Hey, you!

850
01:07:25,943 --> 01:07:28,503
Hey, you! Stop!

851
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:31,875
Stop him, somebody!

852
01:07:33,619 --> 01:07:35,773
All right, all right. He got away.

853
01:07:35,808 --> 01:07:38,049
We'll either catch him
or he won't come back.

854
01:07:38,084 --> 01:07:40,083
Either way, we're rid of him.

855
01:07:40,118 --> 01:07:42,120
I'd like to gamble he won't be back.

856
01:07:42,155 --> 01:07:44,205
What about the other two?

857
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,731
Well, get the mayor,
give 'em a trial.

858
01:07:47,729 --> 01:07:50,004
You can't hang 'em without a trial.

859
01:07:50,704 --> 01:07:53,207
Ep, I don't like it.

860
01:08:02,012 --> 01:08:04,326
I've seen 'em, Mr. Clark. The wagons.

861
01:08:04,361 --> 01:08:07,762
That soldier was right. Elam King
has got a shipment coming in.

862
01:08:07,797 --> 01:08:09,906
Thanks, Briggs. Come on, boys.

863
01:08:09,941 --> 01:08:12,444
We got a little business
east of here.

864
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,331
Sheriff? When I get back,

865
01:08:15,366 --> 01:08:18,073
I wanna find this town restored
to law and order.

866
01:08:18,971 --> 01:08:22,839
But Ep! Hanging soldiers!
It ain't legal.

867
01:08:22,874 --> 01:08:25,035
Can't we just keep 'em in jail?

868
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:27,196
You look after your prisoners.

869
01:08:27,952 --> 01:08:30,159
And you look after the sheriff.

870
01:08:51,459 --> 01:08:54,428
Stands to reason they didn't get
the captain, or he'd be here.

871
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:57,100
I've been pondering on things
so hard,

872
01:08:57,135 --> 01:08:59,144
I ain't had a chance to think.

873
01:08:59,179 --> 01:09:01,977
Why couldn't you
stick with buttermilk?

874
01:09:11,826 --> 01:09:13,980
- Ready for the trial.
- Trial?

875
01:09:14,015 --> 01:09:16,381
- We ain't even seen a lawyer!
- Looking at one now.

876
01:09:16,416 --> 01:09:18,479
That's him. All right, Mayor.

877
01:09:18,514 --> 01:09:20,744
Court'll come to order.
Guilty or not guilty?

878
01:09:20,779 --> 01:09:22,707
- Wait a minute!
- Not guilty.

879
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:24,931
- What does the prosecution say?
- Got witnesses.

880
01:09:24,966 --> 01:09:27,935
Saw them and their friend rob
Clark's store and kill Walters.

881
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:30,955
That so?
- That's right.
- You call this a trial?!

882
01:09:30,990 --> 01:09:33,977
It's the only one you're gonna get.
What does the defence say?

883
01:09:34,012 --> 01:09:36,593
On behalf of my clients,
I withdraw the plea of not guilty

884
01:09:36,628 --> 01:09:39,175
...and throw 'em on the mercy of the court.
- You what?!

885
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:41,458
Sergeant Maitland, Private Clegg,

886
01:09:41,459 --> 01:09:44,519
I hereby sentence you to hang
by your necks until you're dead.

887
01:09:44,554 --> 01:09:47,333
Same goes for Captain Devlin...
soon as we catch him.

888
01:09:47,368 --> 01:09:49,728
Court's adjourned.

889
01:09:51,835 --> 01:09:53,828
Oh, but Sheriff.

890
01:09:53,863 --> 01:09:56,218
You've gotta listen to reason!

891
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:00,857
- They can't do this.
- They already done it.

892
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:04,245
Maybe they'll let
that Nell Garrison tie the knot.

893
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,296
I thought you were
kinda sweet on her.

894
01:10:06,331 --> 01:10:08,264
I could've been.

895
01:10:42,284 --> 01:10:45,151
Johnny? Johnny!

896
01:10:46,765 --> 01:10:48,814
What do you want?
- I've got to talk to you.

897
01:10:48,849 --> 01:10:51,665
- Don't listen to her, Johnny.
- Go away, will you?

898
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:55,304
- You've talked enough already.
- No, please, Johnny. Listen to me.

899
01:10:55,339 --> 01:10:58,908
Why don't you talk to your friends,
get a good seat for the hanging?

900
01:11:07,817 --> 01:11:09,147
Mr. Massey?

901
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:11,098
Hi, Nell.

902
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:13,194
You can't hang those soldiers!

903
01:11:13,229 --> 01:11:16,778
Got to. Clark said that I do.
Anyway, you're the one to blame.

904
01:11:16,813 --> 01:11:18,728
You informed on 'em.

905
01:11:18,763 --> 01:11:22,381
But I didn't know what I was doing.
I didn't realise Ep would hang 'em.

906
01:11:22,416 --> 01:11:25,005
- Oh, it's all wrong.
- Sure it's wrong.

907
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,986
- It's also too late to do anything about it.
- No, it isn't.

908
01:11:28,021 --> 01:11:30,665
We both have been afraid of Ep
too long.

909
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:33,310
Oh, you've got the keys. Let them go.

910
01:11:33,899 --> 01:11:36,314
I don't wanna be no dead hero, Nell.

911
01:11:36,349 --> 01:11:39,523
You don't have to be.
You can get out of this town.

912
01:11:39,558 --> 01:11:41,858
You could come with us.

913
01:11:42,987 --> 01:11:46,673
- Ep would find us.
- He doesn't own the whole country.

914
01:12:02,147 --> 01:12:04,866
Why do you wanna do this
all of a sudden?

915
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:08,310
- Conscience?
- Maybe that.

916
01:12:09,182 --> 01:12:12,140
Maybe it's about time something
decent happened in this town.

917
01:12:12,175 --> 01:12:14,090
Nell?

918
01:12:14,125 --> 01:12:16,946
I'm with you. I'll back your play.

919
01:12:18,462 --> 01:12:21,204
You know, it's a big chance
to be taking for me.

920
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:23,277
I'm not doing it for you.

921
01:12:23,312 --> 01:12:25,695
I'm doing it for me.

922
01:12:35,692 --> 01:12:37,847
Now, listen,

923
01:12:37,882 --> 01:12:39,605
I'm letting you out

924
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:42,746
So you can shoot us in the back
for trying to escape. Is that it?

925
01:12:42,781 --> 01:12:45,644
I'm doing one right thing
in my life, and this is it.

926
01:12:51,995 --> 01:12:53,932
That's far enough.

927
01:12:53,967 --> 01:12:56,299
Unless you wanna join him.

928
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,406
Come in, Brother.
We've been expecting thee.

929
01:14:14,384 --> 01:14:17,091
Whoa!

930
01:14:20,172 --> 01:14:23,147
- You heading in to Elam King's?
- What's it to you?

931
01:14:23,182 --> 01:14:27,095
Well, if these are his supply wagons,
he asked us to ride you in.

932
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:29,175
We don't need company.

933
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:31,221
Just offering to help.

934
01:14:32,289 --> 01:14:34,242
Giddup!

935
01:14:46,522 --> 01:14:48,797
All right.

936
01:14:58,886 --> 01:15:01,371
Hide the wagons in Blackfoot Canyon
and wait till dark.

937
01:15:01,471 --> 01:15:03,826
Then take 'em into town.

938
01:15:12,384 --> 01:15:14,679
- How do you feel, Will?
- I'm hungry.

939
01:15:14,714 --> 01:15:17,262
I thought they gave
a condemned man a last meal.

940
01:15:17,297 --> 01:15:19,566
In this jail,
they charge you for it.

941
01:15:19,601 --> 01:15:23,014
- Well, I ain't got any money.
- You ain't got time to earn any, either.

942
01:15:24,397 --> 01:15:26,166
Everything ready?

943
01:15:26,201 --> 01:15:28,817
All you gotta do is pull the handle.

944
01:15:28,852 --> 01:15:30,984
Wait!

945
01:15:34,694 --> 01:15:37,890
What are you doing here?
Look, we don't want any witnesses.

946
01:15:37,925 --> 01:15:41,233
Don't be a fool, Rafe. You know how
Ep likes everything proper.

947
01:15:41,268 --> 01:15:44,685
I think he'd want the boys to have
a preacher. So I brought one.

948
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:48,102
Brother Abraham. He'd like to say
a word for the men before they go.

949
01:15:48,137 --> 01:15:50,071
What good's it gonna do 'em?

950
01:15:50,106 --> 01:15:53,553
It won't do 'em any good, but it'll
make the whole thing look better.

951
01:15:53,588 --> 01:15:57,021
Well, maybe they don't want a...
a holy Willie.

952
01:15:57,056 --> 01:15:59,891
I don't think they wanna get hung,
either.

953
01:16:01,232 --> 01:16:03,181
You men wanna say something
to the preacher?

954
01:16:03,495 --> 01:16:06,271
No! Get it over with.

955
01:16:09,477 --> 01:16:11,707
I'd appreciate a last word
before we go.

956
01:16:11,742 --> 01:16:14,299
All right. But make it quick.

957
01:16:21,571 --> 01:16:23,792
Have faith, sayeth the Lord.

958
01:16:23,827 --> 01:16:26,180
And all things will come to thee.

959
01:16:26,215 --> 01:16:29,048
For with faith,
thou canst move mountains.

960
01:16:29,083 --> 01:16:31,806
Or sever the cords of adversity

961
01:16:31,841 --> 01:16:35,265
that have bound thee
to set thee free.

962
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:39,576
The Lord also sayeth, have patience.

963
01:16:39,611 --> 01:16:46,005
And the reward thou dost deserve
shall come to thee.

964
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:50,828
If righteousness be on thy side,

965
01:16:50,863 --> 01:16:53,392
So, go thee on thy journey,

966
01:16:53,427 --> 01:16:55,878
comforted by his presence.

967
01:16:55,913 --> 01:16:58,052
And be prepared for what may come.

968
01:16:58,087 --> 01:17:00,297
Amen!

969
01:17:01,077 --> 01:17:04,137
Brothers, as a minister of
the gospel, I've done all that I can.

970
01:17:04,172 --> 01:17:06,990
From now on, thou art on thine own.

971
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:19,488
Well, Parson. If you're through now,
we'll get on with the hanging.

972
01:17:19,523 --> 01:17:23,011
Blessed are the meek,
for they shall inherit the Earth.

973
01:17:23,665 --> 01:17:25,986
Let us all kneel in prayer.

974
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:29,847
Let us prayl

975
01:17:30,774 --> 01:17:33,186
Pull the trap!

976
01:17:47,247 --> 01:17:50,284
- If thee is struck on one cheek...
- Turn then the other.

977
01:17:55,698 --> 01:17:58,826
Lift not thy hand in violence!
I can't remember a mention of feet.

978
01:18:08,372 --> 01:18:10,488
Let's move, let's move.

979
01:18:10,523 --> 01:18:12,773
Go on!

980
01:18:15,601 --> 01:18:17,615
You lay back. Lay back.

981
01:18:17,650 --> 01:18:19,561
You're going to be all right.

982
01:18:19,596 --> 01:18:22,020
I feel all right.

983
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:27,479
I've had this for a long time, but...

984
01:18:28,127 --> 01:18:30,573
...never did any good by it.

985
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:33,696
You have now.

986
01:18:33,731 --> 01:18:36,393
That's why I feel all right.

987
01:18:37,271 --> 01:18:39,637
Just let me rest a mlnute and I'll...

988
01:18:39,672 --> 01:18:41,963
help you go get Clark.

989
01:18:42,671 --> 01:18:46,350
Might save some lives,
if we get there in time.

990
01:18:46,385 --> 01:18:50,029
- Where?
- He's gone out
to stop King's wagon train.

991
01:18:51,313 --> 01:18:55,158
He'll be surprised when he sees me
come riding in with -

992
01:19:05,453 --> 01:19:07,720
All these people
are depending on me, Captain.

993
01:19:07,755 --> 01:19:11,794
I took their money,
and now I haven't got the supplies.
I've got to find those wagons.

994
01:19:11,829 --> 01:19:14,750
I've got an idea
those wagons might find you.

995
01:19:20,265 --> 01:19:22,813
You were right, Captain.
They're coming in to town now.

996
01:19:22,848 --> 01:19:24,874
- Johnny's keeping an eye on 'em.
- Let's go.

997
01:19:24,909 --> 01:19:28,151
- I'm going with you.
- No. You're staying here,
where you belong.

998
01:19:35,865 --> 01:19:38,618
Priscilla!
You heard what the captain said.

999
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:53,223
- Did you find the mayor?
- Looks like he left town.

1000
01:19:53,258 --> 01:19:56,807
Got scared with the sheriff and
Sanders dead and the soldiers loose.

1001
01:19:56,842 --> 01:19:58,882
Ah. We won't see them any more.

1002
01:19:58,917 --> 01:20:01,602
Tomorrow, I'll get a new mayor.
And a sheriff.

1003
01:20:04,762 --> 01:20:07,549
- There are the wagons.
- Well, get 'em unloaded.

1004
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:28,473
Start unloading. Make it fast.

1005
01:20:56,512 --> 01:20:59,720
- We'll come back after the other one.
- You won't have to. I can drive it.

1006
01:20:59,755 --> 01:21:01,699
This is no place for you. Go on home.

1007
01:21:01,734 --> 01:21:04,066
You can't order me around.
Come on! Giddup!

1008
01:21:19,771 --> 01:21:22,820
Where are the wagons?
I'd better get Clark.

1009
01:21:36,193 --> 01:21:38,078
Who fired that shot?

1010
01:21:38,113 --> 01:21:39,963
Devlin. He's back.

1011
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:27,716
Clark!

1012
01:25:03,755 --> 01:25:07,100
It won't work. Like the way
it didn't work for my brother.

1013
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:10,445
Too bad you didn't buy
a better grade of powder, Clark.

1014
01:25:50,632 --> 01:25:53,411
Well, this time we'll get through
without any more trouble!

1015
01:25:53,446 --> 01:25:55,888
Good driving, Grainger.
Race you to Montana.

1016
01:25:55,923 --> 01:25:57,801
- You got a race.
- So long, folks!

1017
01:25:59,367 --> 01:26:00,771
Everything packed, Sergeant?

1018
01:26:00,806 --> 01:26:03,673
- We're all set, Captain.
- Including 50 cents of rock candy?

1019
01:26:03,708 --> 01:26:06,758
Including a dollar and 50 cents
worth of rock candy.

1020
01:26:12,366 --> 01:26:15,540
- Take good care of her, Captain.
- I'll try to make it a full time job.

1021
01:26:15,575 --> 01:26:17,775
- Well, Sergeant?
- Well, Private?

1022
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:19,975
- Now where is he?
- Right here.

1023
01:26:22,397 --> 01:26:24,618
Come on, Will. Let's get aboard.

1024
01:26:24,653 --> 01:26:27,656
Well, I've been thinking about
getting saved from hanging.

1025
01:26:27,691 --> 01:26:30,100
And... and Brother Abraham
could use some help.

1026
01:26:30,135 --> 01:26:33,514
The fact is, I've signed up
to do a hitch with the Brothers.

1027
01:26:35,009 --> 01:26:38,661
I hope you can give him
a promotion some day, Brother.
He never got one under me.

1028
01:26:38,696 --> 01:26:40,753
I've already promoted him.

1029
01:26:40,788 --> 01:26:42,984
Brother first class.

1030
01:26:43,019 --> 01:26:45,197
I'm gonna miss you fellas.

1031
01:26:45,232 --> 01:26:47,332
Sure. Good luck, Will.

1032
01:26:47,367 --> 01:26:49,699
When you get out west, Will,
look us up.
