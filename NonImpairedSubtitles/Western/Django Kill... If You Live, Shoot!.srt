1
00:00:00,597 --> 00:00:03,623
Run, run!

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:10,929
Get it!

3
00:01:02,826 --> 00:01:04,885
No, no. Let me go, please.

4
00:01:05,095 --> 00:01:06,619
Hold him tight!

5
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,831
Hold him tight!

6
00:01:17,474 --> 00:01:20,375
Hold the boy!

7
00:01:20,644 --> 00:01:23,579
- Shit!
- Stop him!

8
00:01:27,684 --> 00:01:29,311
Leave him alone.

9
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:34,122
Hey, stranger, get over here.

10
00:01:37,694 --> 00:01:41,152
Don't you know it's dangerous to put
your nose in other peoples' business?

11
00:01:41,832 --> 00:01:45,529
It looked like fun, so I joined in.

12
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:47,867
Fun is just what they were having.

13
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:52,364
He was just invited to a party,
and he's the guest of honor.

14
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:54,506
It'll be a family party.

15
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:57,411
He doesn't look anxious to
go to your party.

16
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:01,813
That's exactly the reason
why we invited him.

17
00:02:01,885 --> 00:02:04,319
Why don't you come, too?
I like the tip of your trigger finger.

18
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:07,482
Isn't it a pity that every time you shoot
a man, you're wasting gold?

19
00:02:07,624 --> 00:02:09,251
Don't you save it for special occasions?

20
00:02:10,026 --> 00:02:11,823
Listen, I've got a proposal for you.

21
00:02:12,662 --> 00:02:16,928
On my ranch, I have living quarters
for a man like you.

22
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,389
Come work for me.

23
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:22,970
Maybe. It depends on what work
you need done.

24
00:02:25,475 --> 00:02:26,442
Tie him up tight!

25
00:02:27,144 --> 00:02:29,442
Don't be afraid that you'll hurt him.

26
00:02:30,747 --> 00:02:31,907
- Pedro!
- Yes, boss.

27
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:35,814
Take one of my fastest horses and
visit his father.

28
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:40,615
Tell him we want all the gold he found
on the outlaws they hung...

29
00:02:40,724 --> 00:02:42,624
...or we'll kill his son.

30
00:02:42,826 --> 00:02:45,192
Also tell him I want all of it soon.

31
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:49,022
I'm anxious to close this deal.

32
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,826
Sure thing, boss. Right away.

33
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:53,569
Boys, there will be gold for all of you.

34
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:01,134
What are your thoughts, my friend?

35
00:03:01,444 --> 00:03:04,777
I myself believe fathers have a
strong love for their sons.

36
00:03:05,215 --> 00:03:09,515
While we're all waiting, let's entertain
our handsome, young guest.

37
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,751
Guarnito! Hurry! We're waiting to
begin the party.

38
00:03:30,807 --> 00:03:33,401
Why not sit down? Go on, sit there.

39
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,142
Make yourself at home, next to me.

40
00:03:38,281 --> 00:03:40,715
Don't my boys have a good time here?

41
00:03:40,817 --> 00:03:43,183
Why don't you join in the fun?

42
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:54,926
Come on. Drink up. Eat something.

43
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:57,226
Before you know it, you'll feel
like one of us.

44
00:03:57,868 --> 00:04:00,428
The place, the food, and the drink
satisfy man's basic needs...

45
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,028
...and even more refined sensations,
like crying, for instance.

46
00:04:04,174 --> 00:04:06,005
This doesn't seem right.

47
00:04:07,844 --> 00:04:09,471
You, holding the kid hostage.

48
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:12,139
I didn't know you were a model citizen.

49
00:04:14,017 --> 00:04:16,542
Come on, you must have broken the
law at some time in your life.

50
00:04:17,187 --> 00:04:19,314
You handle a gun noticeably well,
stranger.

51
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:25,727
Yeah. I have good reason to practice.

52
00:04:26,196 --> 00:04:30,929
It is unlikely you got all that practice
being an honest, law abiding man.

53
00:04:31,568 --> 00:04:34,230
You'll enjoy being
a member of my gang.

54
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:36,472
It should be quite obvious.

55
00:04:37,807 --> 00:04:41,299
Mirami, my boys are hard workers...

56
00:04:41,444 --> 00:04:45,107
...so I give them the best of everything.

57
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:47,207
See for yourself.

58
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:50,276
I taught them well, to enjoy good things.

59
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:28,123
If I have to pay the ransom
for my son's life...

60
00:05:28,224 --> 00:05:29,191
...you should help, too.

61
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:30,315
Why should l?

62
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:33,954
He's your son.
You pay with your share of the gold.

63
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:37,399
We're partners.
We share the same secret.

64
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,626
You pay your ransom, not me.

65
00:05:38,735 --> 00:05:40,396
My share is not enough.
They'll kill him.

66
00:05:40,937 --> 00:05:43,929
Don't you see they're determined
to get all of the gold back?

67
00:05:44,107 --> 00:05:47,270
Not my share. That stays with me.

68
00:05:47,344 --> 00:05:50,074
The kid is not my responsibility.

69
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,879
I thought you were my partner.

70
00:05:52,015 --> 00:05:55,007
I am your partner, Templer, but
the boy is yours.

71
00:05:55,118 --> 00:05:56,176
My God, you're scum.

72
00:05:56,353 --> 00:05:58,344
Let me go or I'll shoot.

73
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:02,317
I'll make you pay.

74
00:06:08,398 --> 00:06:13,597
Where are you? Can't you make up
your mind quickly about the gold?

75
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,494
Take it easy, there.

76
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:21,070
Help yourself as much as you want.

77
00:06:22,312 --> 00:06:27,215
Tell them they've got 5 minutes
to make up their lousy minds.

78
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,189
- Did he agree?
- No.

79
00:06:35,325 --> 00:06:36,257
He wouldn't give it to you?

80
00:06:36,393 --> 00:06:37,951
No. I couldn't make him understand.

81
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:40,154
That was our chance to
get our hands on all of it.

82
00:06:40,263 --> 00:06:41,594
You mean, to sacrifice my son?

83
00:06:41,998 --> 00:06:46,332
Can't you see it's only a bluff?
They're just trying to scare you--

84
00:06:46,503 --> 00:06:47,731
I'm not going to take that risk.

85
00:06:47,837 --> 00:06:50,203
The trouble is, you're weak as water.

86
00:06:50,306 --> 00:06:52,900
You'd be a fool, telling them you've
managed to get all the gold.

87
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:54,033
Deny it! Deny it!

88
00:06:54,144 --> 00:06:56,135
Make them think you don't have it.

89
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:05,676
Here he comes.

90
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:13,052
It's no good. He says he doesn't
have the gold.

91
00:07:13,363 --> 00:07:17,322
He asked you to let the boy go.

92
00:07:20,036 --> 00:07:21,765
I have a job for you, stranger.

93
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,075
Carry this kid's corpse
back to his father.

94
00:07:27,844 --> 00:07:30,005
Max! You know what to do.

95
00:07:33,216 --> 00:07:34,183
Wait a minute.

96
00:07:36,386 --> 00:07:38,752
I have an idea how
he can be of use to us.

97
00:07:41,558 --> 00:07:42,991
I'll get your gold.

98
00:07:43,226 --> 00:07:45,194
You want to save the boy,
don't you?

99
00:07:45,895 --> 00:07:47,123
Guess I'm getting old.

100
00:07:48,765 --> 00:07:50,392
All right.

101
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:57,332
You must first shoot
that rope there...

102
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,870
...the one that ties him to the wall.

103
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:06,004
I know you're an excellent shot,
so it should be easy for you.

104
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:11,187
But not so easy after
drinking the rest of this whisky.

105
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:12,910
How about that?

106
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:39,612
I want to see if you're a good drinker.

107
00:08:39,682 --> 00:08:41,809
He can get drunk.

108
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:47,722
Silence! Drinking is like playing.
You need concentration.

109
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:18,487
Now we'll see what kind of
man you really are.

110
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,349
Pablo.

111
00:10:05,201 --> 00:10:06,190
Stop.

112
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:07,758
I'll handle this.

113
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:14,842
Very smart.
You surprised me, friend.

114
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:17,503
Very smart.

115
00:10:18,314 --> 00:10:21,875
But you should know better--
The boy is still tied up.

116
00:10:22,218 --> 00:10:23,276
I'll give him to you anyway.

117
00:10:25,221 --> 00:10:26,279
Cut that cord!

118
00:10:27,223 --> 00:10:31,922
Hurry up! His life has been saved.

119
00:10:33,296 --> 00:10:36,823
Cheer up, boy, if you want to
please your father.

120
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:38,831
You should start praying for death...

121
00:10:39,469 --> 00:10:42,199
...because now your life is worth less
than the gold or the sand in the desert.

122
00:10:43,406 --> 00:10:46,341
What's this? A funeral?
Get on with the party.

123
00:13:25,401 --> 00:13:27,369
Who fired a gun?

124
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:32,032
- I don't know.
- It was a gunshot.

125
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:35,837
- Where did the shot come from?
- From the stable.

126
00:13:42,318 --> 00:13:45,879
What happened? It was an accident.

127
00:13:45,988 --> 00:13:47,080
He was playing with my gun.

128
00:13:48,991 --> 00:13:50,390
He was looking for trouble.

129
00:13:50,593 --> 00:13:54,324
I know how you must feel, stranger,
after you did your best to save him.

130
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,125
He didn't want to be a man.

131
00:13:56,232 --> 00:13:57,096
What do you mean?

132
00:13:57,366 --> 00:13:59,095
A man must take on responsibility.

133
00:13:59,702 --> 00:14:03,399
A man does what he must do,
and accepts the consequences.

134
00:14:04,207 --> 00:14:05,902
I'd say he died like a man.

135
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:09,438
My offer is still open to you,
if you want to accept it.

136
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,348
Take him back to town, to his father,
and get all the gold he's hidden.

137
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,541
If he doesn't cooperate,
he'll have visitors.

138
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:19,778
I'll go, but I don't think
it will do any good now.

139
00:14:19,922 --> 00:14:21,583
I think it depends on you.

140
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:22,758
Pablo, saddle up that horse.

141
00:14:23,726 --> 00:14:25,819
- You see anyone?
- Not yet.

142
00:14:27,063 --> 00:14:28,394
Why don't they come?

143
00:14:56,626 --> 00:14:57,593
What is it?

144
00:14:58,828 --> 00:15:00,819
The stranger is bringing him in now.

145
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,258
What happened? How is he?

146
00:15:02,365 --> 00:15:05,994
You better prepare yourself,
Templer. It doesn't look good.

147
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:09,636
Here they are.

148
00:15:41,537 --> 00:15:42,731
Come on, take him.

149
00:15:59,956 --> 00:16:00,718
Take him.

150
00:16:02,224 --> 00:16:03,213
Help me with him.

151
00:16:14,904 --> 00:16:16,462
Come on, move away from the table.

152
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,021
My poor boy, what did they do?

153
00:16:45,768 --> 00:16:46,598
Are you mad?

154
00:16:47,403 --> 00:16:48,700
He was disgusted of a father like you.

155
00:16:49,205 --> 00:16:50,763
Hold him.

156
00:17:06,288 --> 00:17:07,550
What's wrong with him?

157
00:17:07,623 --> 00:17:08,590
He must be out of his mind...

158
00:17:08,724 --> 00:17:12,057
...to have no respect for the feelings
of a father for his son.

159
00:17:12,361 --> 00:17:14,261
Kick him out of here, once and for all.

160
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:35,017
You'd better give up that gold, Templer.

161
00:17:39,922 --> 00:17:41,389
Or they'll come and get you.

162
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:53,298
Are you going to just let him
walk out of here?

163
00:17:56,806 --> 00:17:59,969
No, not now.
There is too much wickedness.

164
00:18:18,461 --> 00:18:22,693
They don't know you still have
many gold bullets in your gun.

165
00:18:23,032 --> 00:18:25,057
Son, you must have a lot of faith.

166
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:28,136
When you finish all your bullets,
you must leave.

167
00:19:01,537 --> 00:19:03,368
We have a common enemy.

168
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:06,799
You know who I mean.

169
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:13,711
You must be very careful
of a man like Templer.

170
00:19:13,816 --> 00:19:18,048
He has always threatened me with
violence.

171
00:19:20,556 --> 00:19:23,582
He's come into my house,
where I live.

172
00:19:25,227 --> 00:19:29,288
I didn't think any house in this town
would welcome a guest.

173
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:33,661
Mine's different. If a stranger comes to
my door, tired and hungry...

174
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:35,532
...he's always welcome.

175
00:19:36,739 --> 00:19:38,263
Come on, stranger.

176
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:43,335
Why are you so generous?

177
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:49,016
Because I'm scared.
I've been threatened.

178
00:19:49,852 --> 00:19:52,912
You can protect us.
I must have protection.

179
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:54,483
I'll pay you.

180
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:45,803
I do everything myself.
I don't have any servants.

181
00:20:45,908 --> 00:20:49,036
I don't trust them. They steal and,
there are too many nice things here.

182
00:20:49,144 --> 00:20:51,135
Eat up. I'm sure you're hungry.

183
00:20:54,383 --> 00:20:58,285
You'll get special treatment,
if you'll just stay here.

184
00:20:58,387 --> 00:21:02,346
You won't believe this,
but I treat everybody specially.

185
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:06,352
An honest person can't sleep well
in this town.

186
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:11,998
Are you afraid to live alone?

187
00:21:14,737 --> 00:21:16,227
Yes, I am afraid...

188
00:21:16,472 --> 00:21:18,167
...and I've been unfortunate.

189
00:21:19,008 --> 00:21:21,067
I saw a woman up in that window.

190
00:21:21,844 --> 00:21:24,574
You've already seen her?
She's my wife.

191
00:21:25,114 --> 00:21:26,672
But she might as well not exist.

192
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:31,712
She's unbalanced.
The girl is insane.

193
00:21:31,921 --> 00:21:34,617
I had to lock her up in her room,
poor creature.

194
00:21:35,057 --> 00:21:39,426
She wouldn't harm anyone.
She has the mind of a child.

195
00:21:39,528 --> 00:21:41,462
If anything happened to me...

196
00:21:41,563 --> 00:21:43,793
...Sorrow's men would come around.

197
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:50,097
What if Templer came here. A man with
no religious principles or morals.

198
00:21:51,307 --> 00:21:55,038
That's why the Lord struck down
his son.

199
00:21:55,611 --> 00:21:58,136
He lives with that woman openly
and they're not married.

200
00:21:58,948 --> 00:22:01,610
Everybody talks about that scandal.

201
00:22:05,721 --> 00:22:07,450
Please say you'll protect us.

202
00:22:13,028 --> 00:22:14,928
I want to go out.

203
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:24,471
She always does it.

204
00:22:29,445 --> 00:22:33,973
She is always like this.
There is nothing I can do.

205
00:22:49,298 --> 00:22:52,893
We better find that stranger
and kill him before it gets dark.

206
00:22:52,968 --> 00:22:54,959
And see about those 2 lndian men.

207
00:22:55,037 --> 00:22:57,198
We have a fine reason to beat them.

208
00:22:57,439 --> 00:23:01,273
Do whatever you want, but be sure
he's as dead as a doornail tomorrow.

209
00:23:01,844 --> 00:23:03,869
All right, boss, leave it to me.

210
00:23:05,481 --> 00:23:07,073
It's a good bed...

211
00:23:11,653 --> 00:23:14,144
But you don't want to fall asleep.

212
00:23:16,325 --> 00:23:17,292
What's that?

213
00:23:23,232 --> 00:23:25,359
Like this, don't turn it out.

214
00:23:26,168 --> 00:23:28,261
I want you to rest, but stay awake.

215
00:23:29,371 --> 00:23:32,738
I'm exhausted.
You can't stop me from sleeping.

216
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,478
I'm getting up early and hitting the road.
Good night.

217
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:46,343
I said, "Good night!"

218
00:25:11,106 --> 00:25:12,664
I knew I'd find you in here.

219
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:16,204
I heard voices and somebody
moving about.

220
00:25:16,745 --> 00:25:17,973
Don't you recognize me?

221
00:25:18,914 --> 00:25:20,745
Sure. I saw you in the window.

222
00:25:22,618 --> 00:25:26,281
You didn't understand the signs
I was making to you.

223
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,118
What were you trying to tell me?

224
00:25:29,324 --> 00:25:31,383
To get out of here. You're in danger.

225
00:25:31,727 --> 00:25:33,251
You don't know what
people are like here.

226
00:25:33,362 --> 00:25:35,125
You're different from them.

227
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:38,422
You must not stay here.
I've got to save you.

228
00:25:40,602 --> 00:25:42,035
Why do you think I'm in danger?

229
00:25:42,204 --> 00:25:44,297
They are trying to murder you.

230
00:25:44,406 --> 00:25:48,308
Life in this place is worth nothing.
Look at me.

231
00:25:56,885 --> 00:25:57,977
What's your name?

232
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,609
Elizabeth.

233
00:26:06,662 --> 00:26:08,152
Your husband says you are crazy.

234
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,197
He's evil.

235
00:26:10,098 --> 00:26:14,091
He wants me to think I'm mad.
He nearly succeeded.

236
00:26:15,837 --> 00:26:17,464
Why does he want to do that?

237
00:26:21,176 --> 00:26:23,167
Because I fell in love with someone...

238
00:26:23,845 --> 00:26:28,145
I've been locked up ever since.

239
00:26:29,518 --> 00:26:31,076
Then you're not really mad.

240
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,714
I don't know.

241
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,418
What's the matter?

242
00:26:37,893 --> 00:26:41,624
It's just...
There must be someone to love me.

243
00:26:56,878 --> 00:27:00,974
He left your door unlocked?
Why did he do that?

244
00:27:01,717 --> 00:27:05,414
Because he wants me to make sure
you stay to defend his house.

245
00:27:07,022 --> 00:27:08,011
Where's the gun?

246
00:27:43,725 --> 00:27:48,128
Get out of here while there is time.

247
00:27:50,832 --> 00:27:53,062
You haven't kissed me yet.

248
00:28:07,749 --> 00:28:10,513
My love! My love!

249
00:28:43,452 --> 00:28:44,544
What's going on?

250
00:28:45,987 --> 00:28:47,113
It's Sorrow's men!

251
00:28:47,255 --> 00:28:50,156
Arm yourself. Wait at the window.
But don't shoot!

252
00:28:57,666 --> 00:29:00,499
Templer, open up.

253
00:29:00,836 --> 00:29:02,770
We've got to do something.
Hide the gold.

254
00:29:02,938 --> 00:29:05,600
- I know where to hide it.
- Where?

255
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:10,276
Templer, you can't stop us.
Do you hear?

256
00:29:10,645 --> 00:29:14,206
We're not playing around.
We're coming in.

257
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,743
All right boys, break the door.

258
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,521
You take care of the horses...

259
00:29:23,925 --> 00:29:29,522
...the rest of you get up there
and break that door down.

260
00:29:37,506 --> 00:29:38,666
Go for it!

261
00:30:12,574 --> 00:30:14,371
Have you no respect for the dead?!

262
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:17,639
The saloon is closed.
We're in mourning here.

263
00:30:22,818 --> 00:30:25,116
Listen to that,
anybody will think it's true.

264
00:30:25,921 --> 00:30:28,981
You know what to do.
Cover every corner of the house.

265
00:31:26,982 --> 00:31:31,419
Templer, either you tell us
where you hid it...

266
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,880
...or we're going to kill you.

267
00:31:32,988 --> 00:31:36,116
You've searched this place from
top to bottom.

268
00:31:36,224 --> 00:31:38,920
You see, the gold ain't here.

269
00:31:39,127 --> 00:31:43,223
It's been taken by that dirty rat,
Oldeman. You'll find it at his house.

270
00:31:43,932 --> 00:31:45,991
If you're lying, watch out.

271
00:31:46,568 --> 00:31:48,900
Quick! They're here. Save me.

272
00:31:49,971 --> 00:31:51,233
Look, they're here!

273
00:31:51,406 --> 00:31:53,340
No! Get away from the window.

274
00:31:53,775 --> 00:31:58,303
Do something. That's why you're here--
to protect me.

275
00:32:02,183 --> 00:32:05,152
Am I suppose to protect
your house...

276
00:32:05,487 --> 00:32:08,183
...your reputation or your wife?

277
00:32:08,323 --> 00:32:10,314
Do you have anything of greater value?

278
00:32:20,468 --> 00:32:21,992
There is light over there.

279
00:32:22,103 --> 00:32:24,037
We'll have fun.

280
00:32:24,172 --> 00:32:26,936
The house is this one.

281
00:32:28,376 --> 00:32:31,470
Oldeman! Oldeman!

282
00:32:32,547 --> 00:32:35,038
We're coming for the gold.

283
00:32:35,216 --> 00:32:37,741
Here it is. Take it. Give it to them,
before they harm you.

284
00:32:37,852 --> 00:32:39,319
You're mad.

285
00:32:41,723 --> 00:32:42,712
Leave her alone.

286
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:51,494
Come on, Oldeman, open up!

287
00:32:52,467 --> 00:32:54,059
We don't like waiting.

288
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:55,934
Open!

289
00:33:03,078 --> 00:33:06,980
- Somebody is there.
- Open the door.

290
00:33:07,082 --> 00:33:09,983
Give us the gold!
Don't waste our time.

291
00:33:10,085 --> 00:33:13,248
He's not him, Willy.

292
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:16,780
It's the gold!

293
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:20,284
It's the stranger! Kill him.

294
00:33:46,621 --> 00:33:51,285
Get the horses and let's go.

295
00:34:06,574 --> 00:34:09,975
Don't be afraid. It's all over.

296
00:34:31,299 --> 00:34:35,759
She betrayed me...
a servant in my house...

297
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:38,202
...no better than that.
Damn that half-breed.

298
00:34:38,306 --> 00:34:39,637
I'll show them both...

299
00:34:39,774 --> 00:34:42,402
...together they'll know who I am.

300
00:36:13,935 --> 00:36:17,063
I know I can't help you.
You should try to forget it.

301
00:36:18,773 --> 00:36:23,301
Don't be so sad. You know I love you.
I'm sure I can help.

302
00:36:28,783 --> 00:36:30,410
I can't love you.

303
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,820
I've got to finish what I've started.

304
00:36:35,924 --> 00:36:37,016
I know.

305
00:36:37,926 --> 00:36:40,190
I've always known
that would be your answer.

306
00:36:40,995 --> 00:36:42,360
You'd leave me.

307
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,089
Where is my gun?

308
00:37:01,316 --> 00:37:05,548
I have given you the power to
walk upon serpents and scorpions...

309
00:37:05,653 --> 00:37:09,521
...to withstand the light of adversary,
whoever they may be.

310
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:14,292
If who so ever among you say,
"l shall be great", shall be small.

311
00:37:14,629 --> 00:37:19,066
Who so ever shall say,
"l shall be first", shall be last.

312
00:37:19,334 --> 00:37:23,634
For the son of God came
among you, not to be served...

313
00:37:23,905 --> 00:37:25,304
...but to serve you.

314
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:30,468
He gave his life so that you may live.
Amen.

315
00:39:18,753 --> 00:39:20,380
What a day!

316
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:25,883
Give me a drink.

317
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:08,999
Rotten thief, now you know what
it costs to double-cross me.

318
00:40:09,237 --> 00:40:11,330
That will fix you and him
at the same time.

319
00:40:15,376 --> 00:40:18,140
He must have taken it
while we were sleeping.

320
00:40:18,346 --> 00:40:19,540
I want to know why.

321
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,142
I better go find him.

322
00:40:23,684 --> 00:40:28,644
What are you going to do when the
others come back to get the gold?

323
00:40:28,756 --> 00:40:29,814
If you want, I'll stay.

324
00:40:29,891 --> 00:40:32,951
No, they'll kill you.

325
00:40:55,983 --> 00:40:57,348
Don't worry.

326
00:40:59,053 --> 00:41:02,716
Go now, and some day
come back for me.

327
00:41:03,724 --> 00:41:06,022
If you don't, I shall die.

328
00:41:09,897 --> 00:41:12,764
- Sure filled him full of holes.
- A good job.

329
00:41:16,037 --> 00:41:18,062
Left his gun behind.

330
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,137
The chamber is empty.

331
00:41:20,374 --> 00:41:22,137
I know this gun. I'm sure I do.

332
00:41:22,243 --> 00:41:27,078
Hey! Wait a minute.
This bullet is solid gold.

333
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:33,446
It's the stranger! He murdered Templer.

334
00:41:33,788 --> 00:41:36,985
Go and get him.
What are you waiting for?

335
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:39,159
Lori. Where the devil is Lori?

336
00:41:39,227 --> 00:41:41,161
I haven't seen her.
She's a bad woman.

337
00:41:41,429 --> 00:41:45,695
I'm sure she's got
something to do with this.

338
00:41:45,967 --> 00:41:47,332
Better get going.
Take your guns.

339
00:41:47,435 --> 00:41:48,697
Yes, let's go. Come on!

340
00:41:59,914 --> 00:42:02,007
Hey, mister. Hey, you!

341
00:42:03,284 --> 00:42:04,512
Come here.

342
00:42:11,792 --> 00:42:14,386
Listen, I'm terrified.
I want you to help me.

343
00:42:14,495 --> 00:42:16,087
They're going to kill me.

344
00:42:16,197 --> 00:42:18,859
Oldeman has killed Templer.
It was awful.

345
00:42:18,966 --> 00:42:23,062
I managed to get away. I saw him do it.
I saw him kill Templer.

346
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:26,297
Where did he do it?

347
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,341
In the saloon.
We just came from the funeral.

348
00:42:30,578 --> 00:42:32,011
Now he wants to kill me.

349
00:42:32,113 --> 00:42:34,138
I'm in danger because I saw him do it.

350
00:42:34,448 --> 00:42:37,110
I don't stand a chance in hell
against Oldeman.

351
00:42:37,451 --> 00:42:39,112
He's a highly respected citizen.

352
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,650
He can kill me and
make it look perfectly legal.

353
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,825
Would you like to be rich?

354
00:42:51,732 --> 00:42:53,131
What do you mean by that?

355
00:42:56,737 --> 00:42:58,534
Exactly what do you want me to do?

356
00:42:59,307 --> 00:43:02,708
I know where he hid
all of Templer's gold.

357
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:05,444
If you help me get it, we'll split it.

358
00:43:06,781 --> 00:43:07,770
Where is it?

359
00:43:07,882 --> 00:43:10,214
At the cemetery. In Evan's coffin.

360
00:43:10,651 --> 00:43:13,051
I don't have the courage to
get it myself...

361
00:43:13,187 --> 00:43:16,782
...but there is enough gold down
there to do things that--

362
00:43:16,891 --> 00:43:20,258
Listen here. If anyone tries to
open that boy's coffin...

363
00:43:20,528 --> 00:43:22,519
...I'll make sure he's shot.

364
00:43:22,697 --> 00:43:25,825
Haven't you done enough?

365
00:43:26,234 --> 00:43:27,792
That gold belongs to Evan.

366
00:43:28,202 --> 00:43:30,033
But we need it to leave this place.

367
00:43:30,871 --> 00:43:33,863
We've got to get out of here
before they kill us.

368
00:43:34,242 --> 00:43:36,267
Your life is in danger as well as mine.

369
00:43:53,561 --> 00:43:54,892
What do you think of this baby?

370
00:44:02,403 --> 00:44:03,961
All right, are you ready? Let's go.

371
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:05,265
Come on, hurry up!

372
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,367
Now we'll see some action.

373
00:44:08,509 --> 00:44:12,001
You heard him. Get going.

374
00:44:12,246 --> 00:44:15,977
If you want to sleep in your beds,
then find those two.

375
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:19,917
Make sure they won't do any more
harm in our town.

376
00:44:20,021 --> 00:44:21,511
Let's get rid of him.

377
00:44:21,722 --> 00:44:22,848
Search everywhere.

378
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:25,515
Let's stay together.

379
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:28,390
Look everywhere.

380
00:44:43,744 --> 00:44:45,302
Hey, his friends are here.

381
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:53,446
Oh, those lndians...they always hang
around with him.

382
00:44:53,554 --> 00:44:56,045
There they are!
Those dirty lndians!

383
00:44:56,624 --> 00:44:59,422
They'll know where he is.
They always do.

384
00:44:59,527 --> 00:45:00,824
Let's make them talk.

385
00:45:00,928 --> 00:45:03,453
Let me get my hands on them.

386
00:45:13,974 --> 00:45:15,805
Kill him.

387
00:45:17,311 --> 00:45:20,109
Don't shoot him. It's a sin.

388
00:45:20,514 --> 00:45:23,176
I always wanted the scalp.

389
00:45:59,153 --> 00:46:01,087
A perfect job!

390
00:46:01,188 --> 00:46:02,155
A perfect hairdresser.

391
00:46:02,256 --> 00:46:04,281
Well done.

392
00:46:04,392 --> 00:46:06,758
It was so easy.

393
00:46:15,636 --> 00:46:17,831
They're coming to get you.
You must hide.

394
00:46:18,005 --> 00:46:18,994
How many of them are there?

395
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,329
The whole town!

396
00:46:33,187 --> 00:46:34,154
Let's go!

397
00:46:54,775 --> 00:46:56,902
Hold it, stranger.
You can't get away this time.

398
00:46:57,778 --> 00:47:01,407
Come on, Willy, stop.
This man is ours.

399
00:47:08,222 --> 00:47:10,486
Now you'll have to answer to
Mr. Sorrow.

400
00:47:31,278 --> 00:47:33,906
Where is he? What have you done?

401
00:47:34,315 --> 00:47:35,782
Your precious lover?

402
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:39,747
Sorrow's man took him away and
tortured him to death.

403
00:47:40,087 --> 00:47:41,384
I thought you'd be pleased.

404
00:47:41,622 --> 00:47:42,919
I'll deal with you later.

405
00:47:43,757 --> 00:47:44,746
Come here.

406
00:47:51,765 --> 00:47:54,461
You'll never get out of here alive.

407
00:47:57,805 --> 00:48:00,399
Hold it. We don't want him unconscious.

408
00:48:13,988 --> 00:48:15,888
You're very stupid...

409
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:19,221
...when you could have taken
advantage of my offer...

410
00:48:19,326 --> 00:48:20,588
...to become one of my boys.

411
00:48:21,128 --> 00:48:26,293
We could be friends, but you prefer
to go your own way, don't you?

412
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,968
You are going to tell me
where that gold is.

413
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:31,831
You made a mistake.

414
00:48:31,939 --> 00:48:33,497
An elementary mistake.

415
00:48:35,276 --> 00:48:40,111
Now, you're gonna have to pay.

416
00:48:40,814 --> 00:48:42,441
Mr. Sorrow doesn't like to be cheated.

417
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:45,009
You'll tell me even if
I cut your tongue out.

418
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:50,980
Carlos, go and prepare our
persuasive little pets.

419
00:48:52,893 --> 00:48:56,852
We'll have to get going,
but you won't be lonely.

420
00:48:56,964 --> 00:48:59,592
I'm going to make sure
you have nice company.

421
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:05,931
Do you like the company of snakes
or blood-sucking vampire bats?

422
00:49:06,173 --> 00:49:10,633
Rats can also be good company.
You won't be lonely.

423
00:49:11,845 --> 00:49:14,905
Carlos, let's wish him a good night.
Come on.

424
00:49:19,353 --> 00:49:21,150
It's useless, Sorrow.

425
00:49:24,692 --> 00:49:26,216
You can't scare me.

426
00:49:28,729 --> 00:49:30,219
You don't know me.

427
00:49:30,564 --> 00:49:33,089
We'll see. We'll see.

428
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,597
I've made stronger men than you
tell me everything.

429
00:49:37,171 --> 00:49:39,036
You'll change your ideas soon.

430
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,132
Come on, Carlos.

431
00:49:41,575 --> 00:49:42,872
Sleep easy.

432
00:51:17,771 --> 00:51:19,762
Willie, Canada, Carlos.

433
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,568
Come on, all of you.
We can get going!

434
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:25,506
Our prisoner has been
persuaded to talk.

435
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:29,479
We know where
the gold has been hidden.

436
00:51:30,017 --> 00:51:32,815
Search everywhere.

437
00:51:33,687 --> 00:51:34,676
Go now. Go!

438
00:52:02,382 --> 00:52:07,410
The cemetery...the cemetery.

439
00:52:09,823 --> 00:52:12,223
Having a good time with your friends?

440
00:52:13,227 --> 00:52:16,890
Interesting, isn't it?
It's better than any party.

441
00:52:18,065 --> 00:52:21,000
The cemetery...

442
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:29,174
If everything goes as planned,
they should be back before dawn.

443
00:52:35,249 --> 00:52:36,238
Don't you want a drink?

444
00:53:14,688 --> 00:53:16,121
How did you get here?

445
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:19,759
You don't believe that this is just
for playing music?

446
00:53:24,131 --> 00:53:25,792
That's right, corporal.

447
00:53:27,868 --> 00:53:30,837
A drink! A drink!

448
00:53:44,151 --> 00:53:46,915
All right, you dirty, old drunk!

449
00:53:51,325 --> 00:53:55,819
It's a pity you don't understand
what my boys mean to me.

450
00:53:56,330 --> 00:54:01,290
They make me so happy
in their black uniforms.

451
00:54:04,805 --> 00:54:08,639
Drink, you feathered sponge.

452
00:54:09,509 --> 00:54:12,171
You'll like it.

453
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:23,688
Damn it. There's no gold in there.
We've been tricked.

454
00:54:23,857 --> 00:54:26,849
It must have been here.
We've got to find that gold!

455
00:54:27,027 --> 00:54:28,688
Go on. What are you waiting for?

456
00:54:30,364 --> 00:54:33,492
Open every grave. Get going.

457
00:54:33,767 --> 00:54:35,257
Dig! Dig!

458
00:54:36,103 --> 00:54:39,266
Dig, damn it.
We've got to find that gold.

459
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:51,073
Dig! We'll find that gold if we have to
tear up every grave in this cemetery.

460
00:56:12,966 --> 00:56:14,399
Give me the explosives.

461
00:56:14,568 --> 00:56:15,535
Take as much as you can.

462
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:20,228
Come on, let's go.

463
00:56:32,486 --> 00:56:33,453
Here, take this.

464
00:56:44,564 --> 00:56:45,588
Come on, let's go.

465
00:57:02,349 --> 00:57:04,340
Here they come. Go, go.

466
00:57:08,755 --> 00:57:11,349
It's the Boss's horse. Get him.

467
00:57:14,861 --> 00:57:15,828
Stop him.

468
00:57:15,962 --> 00:57:17,520
Go the other way.

469
00:57:17,697 --> 00:57:19,187
Get him.

470
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:20,992
Something's wrong.

471
00:57:21,701 --> 00:57:22,668
Get him.

472
00:57:22,769 --> 00:57:25,533
I finally got him.

473
00:58:02,609 --> 00:58:03,576
Damn you.

474
00:59:31,464 --> 00:59:33,659
What have you done, maniac?

475
01:00:03,863 --> 01:00:06,058
It's burning. It's the upper floor.

476
01:00:06,199 --> 01:00:10,067
Everything is burning.

477
01:00:13,907 --> 01:00:16,307
How did it happen?

478
01:00:16,543 --> 01:00:17,771
I hope no one is inside.

479
01:00:17,877 --> 01:00:19,742
You'd better come out quick.

480
01:00:19,879 --> 01:00:22,279
Move yourself, come on.

481
01:00:25,885 --> 01:00:28,752
We must pray. Can any of you get
down on their knees and pray?

482
01:00:29,022 --> 01:00:30,353
I've never seen a fire like this.

483
01:00:30,523 --> 01:00:32,889
What a shame.
It was a beautiful place.

484
01:00:32,993 --> 01:00:34,551
He was proud of it, wasn't he?

485
01:00:34,728 --> 01:00:39,825
There's no point in letting a house
burn down like this.

486
01:00:39,966 --> 01:00:41,297
I won't give you 2 bits for it.

487
01:01:06,293 --> 01:01:08,818
Did you hear the screams?

488
01:01:08,995 --> 01:01:11,486
You can't get close.

489
01:01:11,831 --> 01:01:12,820
Fortunately it's isolated.

490
01:01:12,932 --> 01:01:14,832
Or the whole town could've burnt down.

491
01:01:14,934 --> 01:01:17,198
Let's get out of here.
It's too dangerous.

492
01:01:17,337 --> 01:01:18,964
It can collapse any moment.

493
01:02:30,276 --> 01:02:31,743
Look at me!
