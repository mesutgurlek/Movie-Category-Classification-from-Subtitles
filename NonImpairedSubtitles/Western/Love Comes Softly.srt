[Woman Narrating] It's been almost ayear
since I left my home in the East...

4
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,940
and traveled west
with the man I loved.

5
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,170
I was positive
about my future...

6
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,338
full of hopes and dreams.

7
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,348
Our eyes were always
on the end of the trail...

8
00:01:56,416 --> 00:02:00,375
as if life as I envisioned it
would be just that.

9
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:04,617
In fact, if someone had told me
that I would find myself here today...

10
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,921
I would have
called them crazy.

11
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:10,224
I was sure of myself
and where I was headed...

12
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,390
stubborn and full of pride.

13
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,434
I was in control.

14
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,493
Or so I thought.

15
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,266
Quit acting like a kid, Marty.
Get back here.

16
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,276
No. Not until you admit
that I am right and head this way.

17
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,279
- We're going in the right direction.
- We're going north.

18
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,212
Mr. Graham said
to go north.

19

He said to go northwest.

20
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:35,451
Don't you think it's strange
we haven't come upon it yet?

21
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:40,755
Well, we'd be there already if the weight
of these books hadn't slowed us down.

22
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,263
Those books will provide us
with a little culture once we get settled.

23
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,696
- It's too bad we can't eat any of that culture.

00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,998
that we had to toss off the wagon
to lessen the weight...

26
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,699
would taste a whole lot better right now
than the 200 pounds of books we got!

For once in your life,
be reasonable.

31
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,152
I'm tired...

32
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,990
sick and tired
of the dirt...

33
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,360
and miles that seem to
lead nowhere...

34
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,991
and the layers
of dust on my skin...

35

aching feet, aching back.

36

It's exactly

40
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,541
Can you see it?
Just over there.

41

A-A-And over here,
a barn.

43
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,845
And a garden where we'll grow
our own food.

44
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,891
Those trees are just
made for swings...

45
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,722
for all those kids who are gonna look
just like their mama.

This just feels right,
doesn't it?

This will be the perfect place
to raise a family.

51
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,740
Pass down the land
to our children...

52
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:37,742
and give them opportunities
that are limitless.

and I'm going after him.

for no good reason.

I didn't mean to.

480

I... I was cold. I... I didn't mean to
walk in on her like that.

Well, I know what you mean.
About last night, l... I'm sorry.

482
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:29,662

- I don't know what I was thinking.

I can't stay here.

- Why? That little girl hates me.

You were right.

486
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,242
She does need a mother...

487
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:42,308
but I'm not
the right person.

488
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:45,480
She doesn't know it,
but she's still grieving.

I thought it would.

00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:55,156
- I knew she wouldn't like it at first.
- Then why put her through this?

492
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:57,291
Because I love her...

493
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:59,336
and she needs more
than I can give her.

It adds to the person that you are...

on the fact...

that knowing you is gonna add to the person
that Missie will become.

to get through to her.

01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:32,977
and wrap them
so they won't get infected.

792
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,499
- Here's some coffee.
- Thankyou.

793
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:54,039
What are you
going to do?

794
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:57,545
The neighbors have offered
to collect some logs and raise a new barn.

795
01:11:57,613 --> 01:11:59,877
Ben said he'd take care
of the milk cow...

796
01:11:59,948 --> 01:12:01,882
feed her in exchange
for some milk...

797
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:04,350
until I get my feed
built back up.

798
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:07,651
I think it's gonna be fine.
Pretty much got it worked out.

799
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:10,385
Just keep praying
for answers.

800
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:14,418
- Why do you think he'll answer your prayers?
- He always answers my prayers.

801
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:17,021
Really?
Did you pray for this?

802
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:18,566
Marty...

803
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:21,364
Did you pray to have Ellen
taken away from you?

804
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:25,032
Did you pray that little Missie
would grow up never knowing her real mother?

805
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:28,099
I just don't understand
why the god that you pray to...

806
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:30,907
would let such unthinkable things
happen to decent people.

807
01:12:32,214 --> 01:12:34,148
Come with me.

808
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:37,452
Where?
What about the children?

809
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:40,579
Missie can watch Aaron
for a little while.

810
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:43,386
- Where are we going?
- Going to church.

811
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:55,696
Missie could fall down
and hurt herself...

812
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:58,934
even if I'm walking
right there beside her.

813
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:02,033
That doesn't mean
that I allowed it to happen.

814
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:07,475
But she knows,
with a father's unconditional love...

815
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:11,812
I'll pick her up
and I'll carry her.

816
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:15,151
I'll try to heal her.

817
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,385
I'll cry when she cries.

818
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,894
And I'll rejoice
when she is well.

819
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:25,698
In all the moments
of my life...

820
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:28,032
God has been
right there beside me.

821
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:35,476
The truth of God's love...

822
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:38,741
is not that he allows
bad things to happen.

823
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:44,115
It's his promise
that he'll be there with us...

824
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:48,212
when they do.

825
01:13:57,065 --> 01:13:59,295
I'm gonna go back
to the cabin.

826
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:03,127
Do you wanna stay a while?

827
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:06,764
All right.

828
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:56,443
Missie...

829
01:15:56,518 --> 01:15:59,419
would you do me a favor
and get your pa's dirty clothes?

830
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:02,184
Get. Would you get?

831
01:16:02,257 --> 01:16:04,350
Yes, ma'am, I will.

832
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:06,394
Oh, Lord.

833
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:23,768
Mornin'.

834
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:25,779
Good morning.

835
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,811
Smells good.

836
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:33,878
Excuse me.

837
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:40,655
That wet winter we had
sure did make the ground soft for plantin'.

838
01:17:03,852 --> 01:17:06,548
I haven't seen you
turn a page for 30 minutes.

839
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:09,981
I can't seem to concentrate.

840
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:14,692
I'm going over to
the Grahams' tomorrow.

841
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:18,563
I'm gonna help Ben brand his new calves.
You wanna come along and visit with Sarah?

842
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,602
I don't think so.

843
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:26,273
I should probably spend the day packing.
It's about that time.

844
01:17:27,776 --> 01:17:29,767
Areyou sure?

845
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:38,809
I'll let Missie know.

846
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:53,524
- Missie, come here.
- [Missie] Okay, Pa.

847
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:02,804
[Indistinct]

848
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:17,715
[Faint]
I don't want her to go.

849
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:21,786
[Indistinct]

850
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:47,178
[Chattering]

851
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:03,027
Eveything seems to be
in order.

852
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:06,030
You'll be leaving shortly.

853
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:11,602
Would you?

854
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:16,107
[Cooing Softly]

855
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:29,662
- I wish I didn't have to leave.
- Then stay.

856
01:19:30,732 --> 01:19:32,723
I just can't.

857
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:36,227
I want you to have my books.

858
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:40,164
And this.

859
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,771
My mother gave it to me.

860
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:51,512
I might be leaving...

861
01:19:51,586 --> 01:19:54,521
but my love is
staying here with you.

862
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:17,571
Please say good-bye
to Sarah and Ben for me.

863
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:22,778
I'll always be grateful
thatyou were there that day.

864
01:20:25,554 --> 01:20:28,352
I don't know
what I would have done.

865
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:39,032
[Softly]
Bye.

866
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:42,326
Bye.

867
01:21:08,263 --> 01:21:11,460
Might as well get my things
moved out ofthe lean-to.

868
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:13,091
Okay.

869
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:34,345
Father...

870
01:21:36,358 --> 01:21:40,624
I don't know why
you brought Marty into my life...

871
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:42,822
only to have her
leave like this.

872
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:48,833
I know I don't always
understand your plan...

873
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:56,173
but I ask you...

874
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:58,576
with a shattered heart...

875
01:21:58,647 --> 01:22:01,172
please help me
to accept it.

876
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:06,653
[Sobbing]

877
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:11,682
Amen.

878
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:41,589
Missie!

879
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:46,389
I'm going to bring Marty back. You don't
leave the cabin. I'll be back as soon as I can.

880
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:51,655
Hyah! Hyah!

881
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:07,171
Come on!

882
01:23:21,796 --> 01:23:24,856
I'm glad to be leaving
this god forsaken part of the country.

883
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:27,060
I wouldn't call it
god forsaken.

884
01:23:27,135 --> 01:23:28,932
Horrible snowstorms.

885
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:32,963
Beautiful sunsets.
Rich soil.

886
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:35,202
A woman has to be crazy
to stay.

887
01:23:35,276 --> 01:23:37,335
Crazy.

888
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:39,812
Or in love.

889
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:52,216
[Clark Yelling]

890
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:55,285
[Faint]
Marty!

891
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:59,060
Marty! Marty!

892
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:01,830
Marty! Marty!

893
01:24:01,903 --> 01:24:03,871
Marty!

894
01:24:03,938 --> 01:24:06,099
What's going on?
Who's Marty?

895
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:13,370
- [Man] Whoa, whoa.
- [Whinnies]

896
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:18,179
Clark, what are you doing?

897
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:21,814
A man loses his woman, he goes after her.
It's as simple as that.

898
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:23,790
I thought you wanted me to go.

899
01:24:23,858 --> 01:24:26,656
- I didn't see the note.
- You didn't try to stop me.

900
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:28,821
Until today.

901
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:32,757
Don't leave.

902
01:24:32,834 --> 01:24:34,825
Stay with us.

903
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:38,498
Stay with me.
Please.

904
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:41,371
But... But I have to stay
for the right reasons.

905
01:24:41,443 --> 01:24:43,434
Stay because I love you.

906
01:24:44,646 --> 01:24:47,012
I... I love you.

907
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,846
Or maybe...

908
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:52,386
I should stay
because I love you.

909
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:56,413
That's a good reason too.

910
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:06,667
Whoa.

911
01:25:12,707 --> 01:25:14,698
Mama.
