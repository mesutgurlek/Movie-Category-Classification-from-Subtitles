1
00:01:00,825 --> 00:01:04,556
Oh, Wakantanka,
Great Spirit of the Sun...

2
00:01:04,595 --> 00:01:09,965
source of all life, created
in violence, pleasure and pain

3
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:12,902
which then takes life
to sustain life,

4
00:01:12,937 --> 00:01:17,340
continuing the eternal cycle
of life and death...

5
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:21,675
l stand humble and obedient
before you.

6
00:01:21,712 --> 00:01:25,671
Make me worthy!

7
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,134
How many is that?

8
00:02:50,168 --> 00:02:51,658
Six, Your Lordship.

9
00:02:51,702 --> 00:02:53,260
Maddock.

10
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:54,566
l'm sorry.

11
00:02:54,605 --> 00:02:55,629
"John."

12
00:02:55,673 --> 00:02:56,799
You may address me as "John."

13
00:02:56,841 --> 00:02:58,172
Yes, sir.

14
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:00,541
lt won't happen again.

15
00:03:00,578 --> 00:03:02,102
You slip at least
once a day.

16
00:03:02,146 --> 00:03:04,808
How many weeks have l been
dinning it into you.

17
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:06,942
Yes, Sir John.

18
00:03:07,051 --> 00:03:09,144
Six, did you say?

19
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:10,211
ln a row.

20
00:03:10,254 --> 00:03:11,243
That's good shootin', John.

21
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:12,256
Thank you, Maddock.

22
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,259
You may address me as "Joe."

23
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:19,523
Joe.

24
00:03:19,564 --> 00:03:20,963
What did you say that was?

25
00:03:21,032 --> 00:03:22,431
Prairie chicken.

26
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:23,956
Grouse.

27
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:24,968
Huh?

28
00:03:25,002 --> 00:03:26,230
Grouse.

29
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,569
At home in England,
l'd be shooting grouse.

30
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:34,606
lt just occurred to me,

31
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:36,704
l've traveled halfway
around the world

32
00:03:36,747 --> 00:03:38,237
at great expense

33
00:03:38,282 --> 00:03:41,149
simply to kill
a different kind of bird.

34
00:03:41,185 --> 00:03:42,982
Well, what's wrong with that

35
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:45,579
if you ain't got
nothing better to do?

36
00:03:45,623 --> 00:03:49,957
Oh, l ain't, Joe.

37
00:03:49,994 --> 00:03:54,397
For five years, l ain't got
nothin' better to do.

38
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:56,332
You musta picked up a lot
of beans

39
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:57,334
somewhere.

40
00:03:57,368 --> 00:04:01,202
Not only beans, Joe

41
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:06,142
but family titles, family
property, family position...

42
00:04:06,177 --> 00:04:08,805
all picked up,
all inherited.

43
00:04:08,846 --> 00:04:13,044
Everything l ever wanted
in life l've bought,

44
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:14,517
including you three.

45
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:16,747
ln England, l looked up
to God and royalty

46
00:04:16,787 --> 00:04:19,187
and down upon everybody else.

47
00:04:19,223 --> 00:04:20,918
Well, what you been doin'
for five years?

48
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,620
Looking, Joe.

49
00:04:23,661 --> 00:04:26,926
Just looking.

50
00:04:26,964 --> 00:04:29,694
ln 1820, l committed
the unpardonable sin

51
00:04:29,734 --> 00:04:32,464
of resigning my commission
in the Guards.

52
00:04:32,503 --> 00:04:34,869
lt wasn't an earned commission
anyway.

53
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:37,169
ln my family,
it came with birth.

54
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:41,838
So, here l am...
shooting birds.

55
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:47,774
Your Northwest Territory...

56
00:04:47,818 --> 00:04:49,945
it is beautiful.

57
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:03,833
Hey, Ed...

58
00:05:05,202 --> 00:05:08,865
l dumped the water outta that
damned tub into his tent.

59
00:05:08,906 --> 00:05:09,930
All over his tent...

60
00:05:09,974 --> 00:05:11,100
And look what l found.

61
00:05:11,142 --> 00:05:12,109
Oh.

62
00:05:12,143 --> 00:05:13,440
Rum.

63
00:05:13,477 --> 00:05:15,411
That spell "rum", don't it?

64
00:05:15,446 --> 00:05:18,415
R-U-M.

65
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:20,781
Yeah.

66
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:28,784
Hey, Ed... draw.

67
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,790
Still drunk as coots.

68
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:39,564
l'm going to have
to talk to those two.

69
00:05:39,603 --> 00:05:42,970
ln a pinch, l've known
'em to drink coal oil.

70
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:56,987
Oh... beat the drums
and sound the brass,

71
00:05:57,088 --> 00:05:59,488
here come one big horse's ass.

72
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,694
What were you two firing at?

73
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:16,570
Nothin' in particular.

74
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:21,307
That was an accident.

75
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:23,711
Even at this range,
l'm inclined to believe you.

76
00:06:31,989 --> 00:06:34,116
How long would it take us
to go back to St. Louis?

77
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:36,524
Maybe a month if,
if we don't do no more huntin'

78
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,822
and that wagon holds up.

79
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:39,329
We'll start in the morning.

80
00:06:39,363 --> 00:06:42,127
lf the wagon breaks down,
abandon it and the team.

81
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:45,067
We'll travel by riding horses
if necessary.

82
00:06:45,102 --> 00:06:46,501
ls them orders, John?

83
00:06:46,537 --> 00:06:49,904
Those are orders, Maddock.

84
00:06:56,347 --> 00:06:58,645
Well, you've boozed us
out of another job.

85
00:06:58,682 --> 00:07:00,206
We ain't shuttin' down camp.

86
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:01,980
He guaranteed us
four months wages.

87
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:03,509
You'll get your money.

88
00:07:03,554 --> 00:07:05,784
That's one thing
the dude ain't is... cheap.

89
00:07:05,823 --> 00:07:07,518
Yeah, and if he runs
a little short,

90
00:07:07,558 --> 00:07:09,287
his family can always
sell the "cawstle'.

91
00:07:09,326 --> 00:07:11,453
Oh, l never seen such a fella.

92
00:07:11,495 --> 00:07:13,292
He won't even chew tobacco.

93
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:38,950
That water's powerful cold,
Your Lordship.

94
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:40,615
Thank you, Maddock.

95
00:07:40,658 --> 00:07:43,650
l can assure you l've been bred
to get used to it.

96
00:07:43,694 --> 00:07:45,787
This ain't gonna be no bath.

97
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,263
He's goin' ice-skating.

98
00:07:47,298 --> 00:07:49,459
Listen, you rum-heads,
that's enough.

99
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,127
We was just warnin' him.

100
00:08:06,317 --> 00:08:08,751
Somethin' must have spooked him.

101
00:08:08,786 --> 00:08:10,515
Coyote maybe.

102
00:08:10,554 --> 00:08:13,717
Naw. He seen Tin-pan Morgan
goin' by.

103
00:13:48,591 --> 00:13:50,218
Oh, my God.

104
00:30:21,316 --> 00:30:23,216
Christ!

105
00:30:24,586 --> 00:30:26,178
l've had enough!

106
00:30:26,221 --> 00:30:29,190
You bunch of bloody bastards.

107
00:30:29,224 --> 00:30:30,919
l'm not a horse!

108
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:32,950
l'm not an animal.

109
00:30:34,396 --> 00:30:37,058
No! No!

110
00:30:39,334 --> 00:30:42,428
Whatever the bloody hell
the name is.

111
00:30:42,471 --> 00:30:43,529
Man! Man!

112
00:30:43,572 --> 00:30:48,839
l am a man!

113
00:32:54,603 --> 00:32:57,197
Homme, oui.

114
00:32:57,239 --> 00:32:59,730
Pauvre bête. ImbêciIe.

115

Une fois, tu I'as eu
Ia chance. Une fois.

116
00:33:06,381 --> 00:33:09,077

00:33:20,796 --> 00:33:21,763
American.

121
00:33:21,797 --> 00:33:23,355
Don't be absurd.

00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:24,365
AngIais.

123
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,366
AngIais?

124

Oui.

125
00:33:26,401 --> 00:33:27,459
Merde!

126
00:33:30,205 --> 00:33:32,605
Arrête. Reviens.

00:33:37,245 --> 00:33:39,110
Good AngIais.

Well, when you address me,

Yes. l will speak it.

You yell, make strong.

l can hardly believe
my good fortune.

137
00:34:07,943 --> 00:34:10,912

Well, you speak French

142
00:34:19,021 --> 00:34:20,488
in a most peculiar way.

143
00:34:20,522 --> 00:34:21,648
You're not French.

144
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:24,284
Non. Sacre BIeu, non.

145

l can well believe it.

153
00:34:52,321 --> 00:34:56,621

Great important Englishman.

Buffalo Cow Head.

185
00:36:24,012 --> 00:36:25,036

Everybody be happy,
except you maybe.

189
00:36:39,228 --> 00:36:40,354
No, no.

190

Don't you have any dried...

193
00:42:27,308 --> 00:42:28,969
Batise...

194
00:42:32,647 --> 00:42:33,978
What in the hell's

195
00:42:34,082 --> 00:42:36,141
Black Eagle come
for Yellow Hand sister.

196
00:42:36,184 --> 00:42:37,173
Sister?

197
00:42:37,218 --> 00:42:39,118
l thought she was one
of his wives.

198
00:42:39,153 --> 00:42:41,087
No, no. That one
Running Deer.

199
00:42:41,122 --> 00:42:42,089
She is sister.

200
00:42:42,123 --> 00:42:44,250
Other one is wife,

00:42:51,432 --> 00:42:54,697
Very big important

206
00:42:54,736 --> 00:42:55,998
He only chief number two.

207
00:42:56,104 --> 00:42:59,870
lf she have him,
he be Yellow Hand brother.

208
00:42:59,907 --> 00:43:01,465
Très important.

209
00:43:03,111 --> 00:43:04,442
Big trouble...

210
00:43:04,479 --> 00:43:06,674
Yellow Hand say no.

211
00:43:45,553 --> 00:43:49,683
Work hard, eh? Water?

212
00:43:49,724 --> 00:43:50,952
Yes...

213
00:43:50,992 --> 00:43:55,395
now that her son is dead,
she has no other man.

214
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:58,627
Nobody protect her.
Nobody care.

215
00:43:58,666 --> 00:44:01,794
Cut off finger. Scavenge.

216
00:44:01,836 --> 00:44:04,498
Come winter, she die.

217
00:44:05,606 --> 00:44:09,940
Like you, one time
big grand English...

218
00:44:10,044 --> 00:44:12,911
Now horse, toujours...

219
00:44:12,947 --> 00:44:15,848
& Pour toujours
et tous les jours. &

220
00:44:15,883 --> 00:44:16,872
Shut up!

221
00:44:16,918 --> 00:44:20,149
Stop that idiotic giggling,
you bloody fool

222
00:44:20,188 --> 00:44:21,655
and listen to me.

223
00:44:21,689 --> 00:44:23,919
l've had enough
of your nonsense.

224
00:44:31,332 --> 00:44:33,562
Now, you play your fool
to them, but not to me.

225
00:44:33,601 --> 00:44:34,966
l'm going
to get out of here

226
00:44:35,002 --> 00:44:36,435
and you're going
to help me.

227
00:44:36,471 --> 00:44:37,802
And why l do this?

228
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:40,808
Because you want
to get out, that's why.

229
00:44:40,842 --> 00:44:43,504
Now, these other lndians
around here you spoke of

230
00:44:43,544 --> 00:44:45,808
we'll need a war party
to get through them.

231
00:44:45,847 --> 00:44:47,838
l don't suppose
these Sioux have any guns?

232
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:52,115
What they know about guns?

233
00:44:52,153 --> 00:44:54,587
Never see guns.
Must fight close.

234
00:44:54,622 --> 00:44:57,147
More brave to touch enemy.
They count coup.

235
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:04,429
You look, hmm?

236
00:45:04,465 --> 00:45:05,898
You like, hmm?

237
00:45:05,933 --> 00:45:08,026
l have a big idea...

238
00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:09,161
You marry Running Deer.

239
00:45:09,203 --> 00:45:11,364
Then maybe Yellow Hand
give you war party...

240
00:45:12,807 --> 00:45:18,439
All that for you,
grand white gentleman.

241
00:45:18,479 --> 00:45:20,640
She say no
to Black Eagle

242
00:45:20,681 --> 00:45:24,412
and give herself
away to horse.

243
00:45:24,452 --> 00:45:26,818
Hey, but, ah, you got mane.

244
00:45:26,854 --> 00:45:30,255
Not even old squaw
kiss hair on face.

245
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:52,609
l have a lot to learn, Batise,

246
00:45:52,647 --> 00:45:54,512
and you are going to teach me.

247
00:52:22,803 --> 00:52:26,034
Give them to your mother.

248
00:52:27,341 --> 00:52:30,902
For her with my compliments.

249
00:53:01,075 --> 00:53:03,475
l didn't think that giving
flowers was so humorous.

250
00:53:03,511 --> 00:53:04,876
Um...

251
00:53:12,586 --> 00:53:13,575
l'm sorry.

252
00:53:18,459 --> 00:53:21,394
Me make love to her?

253
00:53:21,428 --> 00:53:23,623
Good God! No.

254
00:54:10,144 --> 00:54:13,580
Batise! Batise...

255
00:54:13,614 --> 00:54:15,479
What is this about her shoe?

256
00:54:15,516 --> 00:54:17,575
What is she
trying to tell me?

257
00:54:22,056 --> 00:54:24,490
She say she have no hole
in her moccasin.

258
00:54:24,525 --> 00:54:26,720
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?
