do you want from him?

Come over here.
I'll bandage your arm.

I thought it was worse.
It's just a scratch.

Does it matter?

192
00:22:11,376 --> 00:22:13,410
I like to know who I meet.

193
00:22:14,612 --> 00:22:17,514
My name is Winnie Getz.

194
00:22:21,053 --> 00:22:22,720
Getz, you say.

195
00:22:24,573 --> 00:22:27,491
Is helping your neighbor

196
00:22:28,627 --> 00:22:30,027
your calling, maybe?

197
00:22:30,094 --> 00:22:32,296
Well, let's just say
I prefer
distributive justice.

198
00:22:32,364 --> 00:22:34,131
Now, what the hell
does that mean?

199
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:36,834
There were two against one
and armed to the teeth.

200
00:22:36,901 --> 00:22:38,168
Didn't seem quite fair.

00:22:40,004 --> 00:22:41,472
Nothing else?

203

No, not at first.

204
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:49,447
But, uh,
then I got me an idea.

205
00:22:49,514 --> 00:22:52,015
Yeah? And what was that?

206
00:22:53,385 --> 00:22:56,053
I heard
what that fellow said,

207
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,656
just before he died.

208
00:22:58,724 --> 00:23:02,826
And I reckon, uh,
something good
could come out of it.

209
00:23:02,894 --> 00:23:04,795
Somethin' real good maybe.

210
00:23:04,863 --> 00:23:06,964
I don't, uh...
I don't get you.

211
00:23:07,065 --> 00:23:09,166
Well, you want to
get your revenge, don't you?

212
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:10,300
Yeah, go on.

213
00:23:10,368 --> 00:23:14,738
Well, to my mind,
it'd be best for you

214
00:23:14,806 --> 00:23:18,443
if that fellow Seagull,
or whatever he calls himself,

215
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,211
thinks you're dead.

216
00:23:22,547 --> 00:23:25,116
Well, you're--
you're forgetting about
the, uh, other guys

217
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,901
when nobody shows up.

218
00:23:26,969 --> 00:23:29,053
Oh, somebody will show up.

219
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:30,254
Who?

220
00:23:30,322 --> 00:23:33,457
Me, pardner.
I'll spell out my story.

221
00:23:33,524 --> 00:23:36,660
I'll tell him
I saw the fight,
took a hand in it,

222
00:23:36,728 --> 00:23:41,098
killed you, but, uh,
too late for the other two,
of course.

223
00:23:43,802 --> 00:23:46,170
Just what do you expect
to get out of this?

224
00:23:46,271 --> 00:23:50,641
Mmm. A reward, maybe,
or a job.

225
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:54,127
It just so happens
that I'm out of work.

226
00:23:54,196 --> 00:23:58,098
No. Seagull would
never fall for it.

227
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:01,702
He'll fall for it
if I can prove to him
that you're dead.

228
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:09,644
Just a minute.

229
00:24:11,547 --> 00:24:14,415
I've got something
that could convince him.

230
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:17,484
Sure.

231

he'll have to believe you.

237

Hey, you! Outside.

328
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:38,748
What did you say?
I said outside.

329
00:30:38,816 --> 00:30:41,852
And you can tell Mendez
this saloon is
out-of-bounds for his men.

330
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,670
Get it? Out-of-bounds.

331
00:30:43,738 --> 00:30:45,205
Have it your way, Horner.

332
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,411
The first man that moves
will get
plugged in the gullet.

Well, your very good health,
Mr. Houston.

345
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:17,431
There's always a call
for men like you here.

346
00:32:17,498 --> 00:32:20,266
Those coyotes of Mendez
don't make life
any too easy for us here.

347
00:32:20,335 --> 00:32:22,302
What's this Mendez
all about?

348
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:25,371
You mean,
what's this Milton after.

349
00:32:25,439 --> 00:32:29,076
Well, Milton wants everything.

350
00:32:29,144 --> 00:32:31,111
He owns
two-thirds of the land
around here

351
00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:33,130
and he wants to get his hands
on the rest of it.

352
00:32:33,198 --> 00:32:34,698
But I say no!

353
00:32:34,765 --> 00:32:36,733
And the other ranchers
are with me.

354
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:39,285
And how long
are you gonna keep sayin' it?

355
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,757
How about that, folks?

356
00:32:43,825 --> 00:32:45,859
How come nobody
gave me a hand?

357
00:32:45,927 --> 00:32:48,461
Listen...
You keep your hands off me.

358
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:53,533
Milton's gettin' more power
every day.

359
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:57,470
When he can't get
what he wants with blackmail
and corruption,

360
00:32:57,538 --> 00:33:00,273
he resorts to violence.

361
00:33:00,341 --> 00:33:03,410
And nobody in town's
got the courage to fight back.

362
00:33:03,477 --> 00:33:06,013
The sheriff was shot dead
three months ago.

363
00:33:06,081 --> 00:33:07,247
And there ain't
a man in the place

364
00:33:07,315 --> 00:33:10,317
with the guts
to take his job.

365
00:33:10,384 --> 00:33:13,153
But I want to
make you a proposition.

366
00:33:13,221 --> 00:33:15,071
Why don't you help us?

367
00:33:23,514 --> 00:33:25,582
I'll have to
think about that.

368
00:33:28,753 --> 00:33:32,156
Right now
what I need is a bed.

370
00:33:48,406 --> 00:33:51,208
where is this fellow
Milton's ranch?

371
00:33:51,275 --> 00:33:52,976
Oh, that's not hard to find.

372
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:54,844
Just head north
out of Austin,

373
00:33:54,912 --> 00:33:57,881
and when
you've forded the creek,
the land's all his.

374
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,918
Hey, why are you so curious?

375
00:34:01,986 --> 00:34:03,687
You aim to pay him a visit?

376
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:06,055
Could be.

who hit that piece of iron
in the air just now.

381
00:35:27,455 --> 00:35:30,640
Sure.
I can do it any time I want.

382
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,944
What's your name?

383
00:35:34,012 --> 00:35:36,646
Tim.

384

Don't you think
you're braggin'
a little bit, Tim?

385
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:41,150
That's a pretty hard thing
to do.

386
00:35:43,153 --> 00:35:44,788
You got a dollar?

387
00:35:47,157 --> 00:35:49,359
Yeah, I reckon so.

388
00:35:49,426 --> 00:35:51,044
Then I'll make
a deal with you.

389
00:35:51,112 --> 00:35:52,979
You throw it up in the air

390
00:35:53,047 --> 00:35:58,067
and if I hit it
before it falls,
the dollar's mine.

391
00:35:58,135 --> 00:36:01,805
Well, you drive
a hard bargain, pardner,
but it's a deal.

392
00:36:05,059 --> 00:36:06,593

393
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:07,794
Okay.

Ready?

395
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,173
Who taught you
how to make that sign?

396
00:36:20,241 --> 00:36:23,110
It's-- it's to bring luck.
My pa used to make it.

397
00:36:23,177 --> 00:36:24,895

398
00:36:24,963 --> 00:36:27,263
Don't you want to bet now?

you'll lose your dollar?

400

No, no, you won it.

401
00:36:32,503 --> 00:36:34,470

even more than you.

has given me full authority
over them.

know something, Mendez?

One of these days
you'll have to
find a new job.

And you know why?

505

Because
I'll have you thrown out

515

He's robbed them blind,

516
00:47:41,655 --> 00:47:43,455
took their land,

517
00:47:43,624 --> 00:47:46,308
even killed off
their sheriff.

you made me a proposition.

Now, do you still feel
the same way about it?

Just wipe Seagull
out of your head

You're talkin' too much, boy.

he can round up.

Listen, Timmy,

819
01:13:23,596 --> 01:13:26,781
you have to prove to me
that you're a real man,

820
01:13:26,848 --> 01:13:30,218
and a real man
must obey orders
when it's necessary.

821
01:13:30,286 --> 01:13:35,390
Now, you stay here,

a whole arsenal

including some
charges of dynamite.
