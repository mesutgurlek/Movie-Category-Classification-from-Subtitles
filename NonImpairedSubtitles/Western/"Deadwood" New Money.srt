1
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,800
You want to know when we're gonna open, Tess?

2
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,600
Well, we're gonna open when me
and johnny fucking say so!

3
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,100
And you three, hovering around like
buzzards outside Al's door,

4
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,300
will not hasten the situation.

5
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,200
It was fucking sun up before
Al called it quit.

6
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,300
Now, he has earned a sleeping-in.

7
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,000
He locks the door, Dan,
when he leaves his office.

8
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,900
Al does not lock the door when he's inside.

9
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,700
That's just the exception that
proves the fucking rule.

10
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,000
I suppose.

11
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,600
May I ask, Mr. Wolcott, what purpose 
draws you to our hills? 

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,900
- Gold.
- Gold? I see.

13
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,900
- Morning, Mr. Utter.
- Morning.

14
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,800
Frequents my buffet religiously.

15
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Yes, I hope to locate and secure
an assortment of claims.

16
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,600
An assortment?

17
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,300
Shrewd hedging--

18
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,900
Which makes me think
this is not your first foray.

19
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,600
If it was, I don't suppose I'd admit it to you.

20
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,300
Only confirming my original impression.

21
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,400
Get his luggage.

22
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,900
My staff will install your possessions.

23
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,900
I thank you.

24
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,300
You bought provisions.

25
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,200
During the night... while I
was waiting for you to come home.

26
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,000
It's a 24-hour camp.

27
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,000
So I saw.

28
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,200
Certain things I said yesterday, I regret.

29
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,500
I will be grateful if you'd not rely on them.

30
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,100
All right.

31
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,100
Representations I made as to
letters I'd written--

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,700
I didn't.

33
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,800
I'll be grateful then if you not rely on my-- 

34
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,700
assurance that I got them.

35
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,000
All right.

36
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,700
I'll hold my deepest gratitude, Mr. Bullock,
for what will let us live as we are now.

37
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,800
This oatmeal looks old.

38
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,200
It does, doesn't it? Richardson, god damn you!

39
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,800
- The oatmeal is clotted.
- Well, it's 45 minutes yet till the three hours.

40
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,000
Stop spouting gibberish and
replace the damned oatmeal.

41
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll make do with the bacon.

42
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,100
A camp like this, one draws one's menials

43
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,500
from a small and brackish pool.

44
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,600
Once the pig is digested,

45
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,600
perhaps we could pursue a possibility
that's come to mind.

46
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,000
If the spirit still moves in you, sure.

47
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,500
Maybe we could do it now?

48
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,500
No. Let's let your mind

49
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,200
ripen and mature the possibility first.

50
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,500
The creature I saw outside our place
last night,

51
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,900
the one you said it was the camp's mayor,

52
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,900
now perches like a vulture over
that man at breakfast.

53
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,200
Of course. Certainly.

54
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,200
Farnum. He owns the hotel.

55
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,700
Have you affection for mayor Farnum?

56
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,500
- None.
- Good.

57
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Because the man the mayor expects to digest

58
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,800
is going to toy and play with Mr. Farnum

59
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,800
from camouflage for as long
as he finds it amusing.

60
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,700
And then make him a meal of his own.

61
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,900
- Who is the man?
- A trick.

62
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,400
A specialist.

63
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,800
Who asks to be called Mr. W.

64
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,500
E. B. Farnum demanding entry.

65
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,100
- Summon al.
- He's not summonable.

66
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,500
For the news I bear,
he'll be plenty summonable.

67
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,100
Why don't you go on up
and summon him yourself, E. B.?

68
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,900
Happily.

69
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,700
He's behind lock and key.

70
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,100
You're certain he's within?

71
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,100
Called out to my knock, said,
"get the fuck away."

72
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,100
Fornication demanding discretion or a bribe.

73
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,900
He's fucking alone,
and he's gonna stay that way

74
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,800
until he chooses to be otherwise.

75
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,900
I think he's fucking poorly.

76
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,800
His voice has got a gravelly timbre.

77
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,200
Want to leave a message?

78
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
In fact, I do. yes.

79
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,000
"Al, if you're not dead and already moldering,

80
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,500
I send news to revive you.

81
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,500
A fish to rival the fabled Leviathan

82
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,400
has swum into our waters.

83
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,300
Get well soon and we will
land the cocksucker together.

84
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,000
Your friend, E. B. "

85
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,100
You might add as a postscript,
"I also have the news

86
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:04,400
you dispatched me to secure of
the newly-arrived cunt." Please.

87
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,300
- You just move here?
- Just yesterday.

88
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,200
I watched the sheriff build this house.

89
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,300
Mr. Bullock's my pa's brother,

90
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,400
that married my mom when my pa got killed.

91
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,200
So now he's my pa and my uncle.

92
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,600
Big trout lives in that deep part down there.

93
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,300
- Damon!
- Coming.

94
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,200
My pa and me are going to grow
apples in Oregon.

95
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,700
Will you come back?

96
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Pa says we ain't never coming back.

97
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,200
Keep your eye on that rainbow.

98
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,500
I call him Jumbo.

99
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Morning, William.

100
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,200
Morning, Mr. Bullock.

101
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,700
You got your gun and badge back.

102
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,700
I did. I put them in that
basket for you to see.

103
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,900
Did you fight that man again?

104
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,200
No. We didn't have to fight.

105
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,100
That boy is going to Oregon.

106
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,700
There's a trout that loiters
just downstream there.

107
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,100
The boy calls him Jumbo.

108
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,700
Maybe after work

109
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,300
We can make him pay for his slothful ways.

110
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,900
does the scope of the find,
mr. ellsworth,

111
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,500
warrant more than the five-stamp
mill we operate with now?

112
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,400
oh, no question, ma'am.

113
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,700
your holdings justify 25 stamps easy.

114
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,500
just a matter of waiting
till the legalities get resolved.

115
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,900
and why would the purchase of a larger
machine await legal resolution?

116
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,300
well, ma'am, 'cause without title,

117
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,700
you wouldn't own no quartz for your
25-stamp machine to crush.

118
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,500
- good morning, mr. bullock. - good morning.

119
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,900
- good morning, sophia. - good morning.

120
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,800
mrs. garret has gone to see her claim.

121
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,300
has she?

122
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,400
- yes, with mr. ellsworth. - i see.

123
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,900
she asked if i saw you,
please to give you this back.

124
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,500
- sophia can learn on another watch.
- all right.

125
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
when opportunity permits,

126
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
you might inquire of mrs. garret,

127
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,000
as few children as are in the camp--

128
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,600
i take your meaning, mr. bullock.

129
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,300
if she decided it was appropriate,

130
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,700
other parties would be delighted and grateful.

131
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,800
yes, well, she will have to decide that.

132
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,000
yes.

133
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,600
the camp pugilist.

134
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,400
fond as i am of you, joanie,

135
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,200
i wouldn't have brought my girls
and my own tired ass out here

136
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,000
on just your kind invitation.

137
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,900
the trick sweetened the prospect of mr. w.?

138
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,900
he offered on one of my
girls to bring her out here.

139
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:45,500
being as mr. w.
is chief lookout for george hearst--

140
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,100
that struck biggest in
the comstock and mexico--

141
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,600
i knew he'd just endorse the camp's future.

142
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,000
short side, mr. w. enjoys being
cranky with his women.

143
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,300
but sometimes when disappointed
his crankiness runs away with him.

144
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,900
what's gonna disappoint him?

145
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,000
devious sort that i am,

146
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,000
i've got the girl he's interested in on ice.

147
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,900
thank you.

148
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,300
mr. wolcott, i'm the custodian--

149
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,000
note i do not say owner--

150
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
of wild bill hickok's final
earthly communication.

151
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,500
it's damp.

152
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,300
mr. wolcott,

153
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,700
not an hour before giving me the letter,

154
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,300
bill confided to me,
having come upon a quartz deposit

155
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:46,000
promising in bill's own words
"wealth beyond counting."

156
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,300
how much wealth is that?
i don't know, mr. wolcott.

157
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,900
i don't know how high bill could count.

158
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,000
how much do you want me to pay?

159
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,200
i'd hardly expect you to pay anything,

160
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,200
imagining rather i will pay you your cost

161
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:09,200
to see the letter delivered 
to its proper recipient.

162
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,500
plus $100...

163
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,300
set against whatever
profits you may generate...

164
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,900
should delivery prove impossible...

165
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,900
from the information the letter contains.

166
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,700
so, this set-off against profits i might gain

167
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,000
in the event that this letter,
proving undeliverable,

168
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,900
contains such valuable information,

169
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,300
have you an amount in mind?

170
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,000
$10, 000.

171
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,800
less the $100 you would pay me?

172
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,300
- correct.
- 900 net then, me to you.

173
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,700
Yes.

174
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,500
and i would pay you that now
before attempting the letter's delivery?

175
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,000
oh, yes.

176
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,800
once you have the letter,
all my connection to it is severed.

177
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,400
i see.

178
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,700
to deliver it or not,
or whatever the hell you want to do.

179
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,700
well, you will have my decision shortly.

180
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,000
- fine then.
- uh, for the luggage.

181
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,600
oh no. i wouldn't hear of it.
it was my great pleasure.

182
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,300
i trust i will, uh, hear from you soon.

183
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,200
i see now what it takes to
bring you back into my life.

184
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,000
just passing through, mr. star.

185
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,600
even so,

186
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,400
it makes a man glad he has three
limbs left to be damaged.

187
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,400
morning.

188
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,200
a man can get me in his life with five bucks.

189
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,400
$2, if he just needs a handshake.

190
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,400
good morning.

191
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,000
- morning.
- morning.

192
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,700
trixie!

193
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,200
many thanks.

194
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,000
how bad is that pain?

195
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,500
- it's all right.
- i'm in my house, sol.

196
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,100
- with martha and the boy?
- chose not to put 'em in the thoroughfare.

197
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,200
or, i see what you're asking.

198
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,000
far as her having a different opinion,
possibly, once i showed up--

199
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,100
no, she chose to stay.

200
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,000
well, good.

201
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,100
anyways, could you open up?

202
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,300
sure. glad to.

203
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,500
- any help with your person?
- no, i'm all right.

204
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,800
swearengen said the county
commissioners are all from yankton.

205
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,200
when was this?

206
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,800
just before we hit the mud.

207
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,700
it's wrong the hills get no representation.

208
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,100
even in an eden like this,
wrongs sometimes occur.

209
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,300
i meant maybe we should try
to do something about it.

210
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,800
- i'm with you.
- god damn it, al!

211
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,900
such as they are, my arts cannot be
practiced at this remove.

212
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,900
stop being a baby!

213
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,000
any secrets

214
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,200
that you feel need keeping
will not be betrayed by me.

215
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,800
doc.

216
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,900
trixie.

217
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,400
rest, uninterrupted.

218
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,400
no visits, no exception.

219
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,100
from his fray with bullock he's poorly,

220
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,300
or his trouble with his prick?

221
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,700
if you can get him to grant you entry,

222
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,100
maybe you will confide that to me.

223
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:36,300
it's trixie-- that's
overheard the doc's instruction.

224
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,000
so let me just shout my information from here.

225
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,300
nobody is dead.

226
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,900
bullock's gone to that house he built.

227
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,100
star is on his feet,

228
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,200
more or less.

229
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,100
anyways, i'm gonna stay on the ear

230
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,700
over to the hardware store.

231
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,100
yeah.

232
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,800
fucking telegraph poles, al,

233
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,000
are next thing to landed in
the fucking thoroughfare.

234
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,600
next leap of the creature, they'll be here.

235
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,100
all right, al.

236
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,300
- where's fucking dolly?
- fucking.

237
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,000
- when was she last with him?
- daybreak,

238
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,500
just before he give bullock back his iron.

239
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,000
we've seen him after she did.

240
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,800
you brew him my fucking tea.

241
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,700
put it on a tray, take it up to him

242
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,800
- and make him fucking drink it.
- all right.

243
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,900
if he don't present himself in a few hours,

244
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,700
kick down the door and get the
fucking doc in there.

245
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,700
i'm lila. welcome to the bella union.

246
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,300
i'm francis wolcott,

247
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,600
which i would be grateful if you would
tell your employer.

248
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,100
this is francis wolcott, cy.

249
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,800
cy tolliver, mr. wolcott.

250
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,400
how do you do, and what will you drink?

251
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,900
kentucky bourbon if you got it.

252
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,400
pour mr. wolcott a bourbon, jack,

253
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,300
- and tell him it's from kentucky.
- kentucky bourbon.

254
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,100
- straight up? - please.

255
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,400
shall we have lila drink with us,

256
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,900
or would you like to drink with lila alone?

257
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,600
i would rather we two converse privately.

258
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,900
just talk now, sir? i'm not that kind of fella.

259
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,800
maybe you're just waiting for the right offer.

260
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,800
it's late in the game,
but i suppose anything is possible.

261
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,500
will you take the air?

262
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,500
if i'm to lose my virtue,
i'd as soon do it outside these walls.

263
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,500
you've approached a group in san francisco

264
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,400
that does business with my employer.

265
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,300
that group and employer bullshit really
quickens me with fucking trust.

266
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,400
that group you've approached is a
fraternal chinese organization.

267
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,700
"tong" is not a clever enough word?

268
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,500
you offered them a contract to send
members to this camp.

269
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,900
that organization has a preexisting
arrangement with my employer.

270
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,600
so you work for who, wolcott?

271
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,500
the railroads, some mining combination

272
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,700
that brings those slant-eyes
in by the boatload?

273
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,400
no, sir. i work for one man.

274
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,100
jesus christ. doesn't every one of us?

275
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,100
george hearst.

276
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,400
i meant no disrespect of any kind

277
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,400
to you or mr. hearst by any word i've
said from the moment we have met.

278
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,200
i understand that.

279
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,700
i have nothing but respect for mr. hearst.

280
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,500
he's in the comstock of montana,

281
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,300
every other place he's ever operated,
without jape or jest.

282
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,300
and the overture you made to
the group in san francisco

283
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,600
showed imagination and foresight and
a tolerance for risk

284
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,800
that was impressive to mr. hearst.

285
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,600
we want to work with you here.

286
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,800
- you do?
- yes, we do.

287
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,300
con stapleton, leon!

288
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,100
get over here and meet a fucking gentleman.

289
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,100
those two work for me now among the celestials,

290
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:57,000
setting up that miserable cocksucker to
get knocked off his high horse.

291
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,900
- con, leon.
- i don't want to meet them.

292
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,100
go inside.

293
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,300
meet me inside.

294
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,400
yes, sir.

295
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,100
yes, sir, mr. tolliver.

296
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,900
just go on in, fellas.

297
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,400
my only contact is with you.

298
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,400
as far as they're concerned,
you and mr. hearst don't even exist.

299
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,800
as far as you're concerned, cy,

300
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,100
in the tasks you'll be performing for him,

301
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,400
mr. hearst doesn't either.

302
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,000
who?

303
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,600
wake up. take account you're indoors.

304
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,400
here.

305
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,700
that's water now.

306
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,400
get it the fuck away from me then.

307
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,500
drink it and don't be stupid.

308
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,900
oh, christ, are we arrested?

309
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,300
i explained all this to you, jane,

310
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,400
that i'm the fucking deputy,

311
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,700
and i fixed up the overflow
cell in case you come back.

312
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,200
shut up then.

313
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,100
and you replied i was boring
the shit out of you

314
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,100
'cause doc already told you all about it.

315
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,200
well, evidently, i don't remember fuck-all.

316
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,500
no. 'cause after every other fucking
thing we went through last night,

317
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,000
you got to make us stop at that new
joint across from nuttall's.

318
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,100
would you kindly shut your fucking mouth?

319
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,100
hey, what the fuck's bill's coat doing here?

320
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,800
well, he wouldn't have
seen it useless or a souvenir.

321
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,700
i figured i'd give it work
keeping the bed warm.

322
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,700
uh, where is it headed

323
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,400
now i'm the occupant?

324
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,500
it ain't going anywheres.

325
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,200
thank you, charlie.

326
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,500
it's cool. sit outside.

327
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,100
wide knees.

328
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,000
are we gonna argue?

329
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,300
we're partners, ain't we, maddie?

330
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,600
ain't that a lot of planning and thinking to 
not let your partner in on?

331
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,600
not sharing it before i even
knew the trick was in camp--

332
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,700
don't put me wrong, joanie.

333
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:52,000
it don't put you right,
far as an atmosphere of trust.

334
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,900
joanie, was there any odds
when me and my girls got out here

335
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,500
that you might have told us you'd
changed your mind?

336
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,700
i guess there was a chance.

337
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,600
or i'd have found you dead or moved along?

338
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,600
no chance on moved along.

339
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,700
only way to guarantee an outcome, honey,

340
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,600
is contracting to be fucked.

341
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,100
everything else is a chance--

342
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,800
including me letting you down.

343
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,700
but if i do, using my head
won't be the tip-off.

344
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,800
how will you bring the girl into it?

345
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,700
at the trick's fierce insistence.

346
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,000
what's our split?

347
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,300
50-50.

348
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,700
what's the girl's end?

349
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,500
i wouldn't rule out a wooden box.

350
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,800
timely purchase.

351
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,500
that's our last in stock.

352
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
goddamn out-thinking myself--
resupplying in smaller orders.

353
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,500
you've been dealing with a few uncertainties.

354
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,400
if the claims get allowed or they don't,

355
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,600
or yankton stacks the commissioners or not,

356
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,500
wee either in business or we ain't,

357
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,300
and if we are, you reduce
costs buying in volume.

358
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:15,000
- your old man?
- on his death bed in fucking vienna.

359
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,600
fellas.

360
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,900
- on the mend?
- doing better, thank you.

361
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,200
hope you are too.

362
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,600
we was gonna thin these inquiries yesterday

363
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
before that trouble with bummer dan.

364
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,700
we've been gonna thin them for several weeks.

365
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,600
is farnum's slop-house okay?

366
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,500
jane is sleeping a load off in my place.

367
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,300
inquiries from other jurisdictions,

368
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,100
we've been somewhat remiss.

369
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,000
whose that fella said
"never put off till tomorrow

370
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,600
- what will wait till the day after" ?
- not my old man.

371
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,900
to buy the hickok letter.

372
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,500
wonderful.

373
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,400
uh, i'll have a bill of sale.

374
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,500
well, certainly, sir. of course.

375
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,300
for reasons of legal nicety,

376
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,200
we'll say you're
purchasing the right to deliver.

377
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,500
you got to let me get to your piss-pot, al.

378
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,200
otherwise, when your mood changes,

379
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,600
you're fucking gonna
yell at me for not doing it.

380
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,000
i think i should get the doc, al.

381
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,700
you need to let the doc in.

382
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,900
you need to let him see to you.

383
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,400
when i was sick, the doc helped me.

384
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,100
and you ain't fucking yelled since
then my foot's dragging.

385
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,300
fuck this, right, doc?

386
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,200
- fuck it. - dan!

387
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,900
you need to fucking break the door down!

388
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,300
- now?
- isn't that what i just fucking said?

389
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,300
- al!
- if i was you, doc,

390
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,200
i would get out of the fucking way!

391
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,200
ow! jesus fucking christ!

392
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,700
- you all right?
- mm, i think i broke my fucking shoulder.

393
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,200
would you open up my case?

394
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,800
al?

395
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,300
al, al?

396
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,100
- do we need to get him laudanum?
- please.

397
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,300
all right, al.

398
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,600
all right. it's all right.

399
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,000
"please don't let up on
the stackpole case,

400
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,500
as i'm sure he's out there."

401
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,400
- no idea.
- i never heard of it either.

402
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,100
all the portions you had on your plate,
i hesitated to fucking inquire.

403
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,200
i couldn't have helped if you had.

404
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,900
fuck the stackpole case then,

405
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,400
and the letter from arapaho
county concerning it,

406
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,600
which goes in the fucked-case file.

407
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,800
i'd like to buy mr. farnum's hotel.

408
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,400
to do what with, mrs. garret?

409
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,100
to renovate and make my residence.

410
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,000
i can think of better locations, ma'am,

411
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,600
with friendlier views.

412
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,000
none that would offer the further pleasure

413
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,800
of putting mr. farnum in the thoroughfare.

414
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,400
i expect a man like farnum finds
quarters pretty easy.

415
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,700
i would expect even
with his venality satisfied,

416
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,700
a man like farnum would feel himself
dispossessed and unanchored.

417
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,800
i think he'd be very sad,

418
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,800
and i would like to see him in that condition.

419
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,000
i guess most of us got enough luck

420
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
to be too broke to act on them type ideas.

421
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,300
what type ideas do you refer to?

422
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,200
the type the lowborn would say we get

423
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,200
when we're pissed off.

424
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,600
although...

425
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,200
my own aristocratic lineage

426
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:09,300
causes me to use the term "sore-disappointed."

427
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,200
i am pissed off.

428
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,800
well, last
turns the wheel has took for you, ma'am,

429
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,100
i would say you've come by it honest.

430
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,100
if punching somebody in the nose would help,

431
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,800
i'll volunteer one that's well broke in.

432
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,700
safely returned.

433
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,800
- is he here too?
- no.

434
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,400
he's my friend, trixie.

435
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,600
among other fucking things.

436
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,800
anyways...

437
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,400
i wonder could you teach me to do accounts?

438
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,400
all right.

439
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,000
i'll pay you.

440
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,300
or you can take it out in cunt.

441
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,600
i won't teach you if you keep that up.

442
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,600
fuck every fucking one of you.
i wish i was a fucking tree.

443
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,700
- mr. wolcott.
- mr. farnum.

444
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,700
the contents of that letter are a deep
disappointment.

445
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,100
not a word of any find or promising location.

446
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,100
you opened it then?

447
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,900
are you trifling with me?

448
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,100
it occurs to me, sir,

449
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,300
this conversation were best had elsewhere.

450
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,000
- but not postponed?
- not postponed, mr. wolcott, no.

451
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,200
we are men, sir.

452
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,600
when we disagree,
we come to resolution promptly.

453
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,100
- where are we going?
- the gem saloon.

454
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:20,100
- it's just over there.
- please take your hand off my shoulder.

455
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,300
some ancient italian maxim

456
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,500
fits our situation,

457
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,200
whose particulars escape me.

458
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,700
is the gist that i'm shit out of luck?

459
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,200
did they speak that way then?

460
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,500
oh, for the love of god!

461
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,900
please, won't you sit down?

462
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,400
so you would have me take the experience
then as a lesson, dearly purchased?

463
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,800
i should tell you, mr. wolcott,

464
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,500
i have seen men in this very camp,

465
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,800
feeling themselves victimized,

466
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,800
seek redress in fashions i thought imprudent.

467
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,500
- violently, you mean?
- thus, at the lesson,

468
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,600
dearly bought as you would have it,

469
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,100
is where i would leave this business.

470
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,500
in any case, i was an intermediary
in this transaction.

471
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,200
ah, then, having been a pupil,

472
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,100
it falls to you now to instruct your principal.

473
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,700
i wonder, mr. wolcott,

474
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,000
if some second letter couldn't be drafted

475
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,000
to put some sharper point on the lesson,

476
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,500
maybe remunerative to both of us.

477
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,100
so your idea would be

478
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,900
that we fuck mr. hearst twice?

479
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,700
i missed the name, sir,
but i can aver as a general principle,

480
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,300
my days of fucking anyone are long in the past,

481
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,100
whomever you represent.

482
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:56,300
george hearst, of the ophir
find in the comstock.

483
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,800
of course, i know george hearst.

484
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,900
- oh, you know him personally?
- i do not know him personally, 

485
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,100
I do not know him personally.

486
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,000
but of course i know of george hearst

487
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,400
and his reputation and
accomplishments and wealth,

488
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,700
and his power and reputation.

489
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,900
and i would say, as well, most importantly,

490
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,200
i have nothing to teach that man.

491
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,900
george hearst need learn no lesson from me.

492
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,500
nor would i permit him entrance into a lesson,

493
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,600
either inadvertently or by accident,

494
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,300
i wouldn't subsequently and immediately
cancel him back out of.

495
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,000
or his agent or intermediary.

496
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,500
mr. hearst doesn't renege on contracts.

497
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,700
then what am i to do?

498
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,700
what am i to do, mr. wolcott,

499
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:49,500
but to admit a terrible and tragic
miscalculation

500
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,500
and supplicate myself and beg mercy
and understanding and forgiveness?

501
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,400
and to aver, if you would contemplate,

502
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,400
any separate or side
transaction or understanding.

503
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,800
remove your hand from my forearm.
do not touch me again.

504
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,800
i look poor,

505
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,500
but that is a cultivated pose and posture.

506
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,600
i am not poor and i am not stingy

507
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,800
when fundamental interests are at stake--

508
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,900
as a complete aside.

509
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,600
there is a service you could do mr. hearst

510
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,500
that would set off exactly against the funds

511
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,700
he might otherwise believe you fleeced him of.

512
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,400
anything, sir.

513
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,500
this service would
enlist you and one or two others,

514
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,200
circulating certain rumors
about the future of the camp.

515
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,200
in particular, about the validity

516
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,300
of the present titles to the claims.

517
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,400
done. consider me enlisted.

518
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,300
consider the validity called into question.

519
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:57,200
i also wish to know the location of your
highest-end brothel.

520
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,000
as it happens,

521
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,100
a whorehouse succeeding to that
title has just opened.

522
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,700
nothing just happens, mr. farnum.

523
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,000
do you think this hat makes my head look big?

524
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,500
no, sir.

525
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,600
it makes your head look the perfect size.

526
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,800
thank you.

527
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,700
you're gonna find out something now

528
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,200
about yourselves and your fellow man,

529
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,700
how you handle adversity--

530
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,100
or rumors of adversity--

531
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,300
or ill fortune, or turns of luck.

532
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,000
and i'm not going to further
rumor or be a party to that bullshit.

533
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,800
you want to know where i stand?

534
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,000
you just look the fuck where i'm standing.

535
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,100
you'll find out all you need to know.

536
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,200
i ain't going anywhere!

537
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,600
and if anyone else wants to,
two weeks fucking severance is

538
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,600
waiting for you right fucking now.
you step the fuck up!

539
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,200
step right the fuck up!

540
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,400
now, that shows me something.

541
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,100
but any time, day or night,

542
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,100
anyone wants to fucking waver or fucking
change their minds,

543
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,900
you just step right the fuck up
and get your severance.

544
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,600
let's open the fuck up and get it
while we can, all right?

545
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,900
- open up! - you heard him! let's go!

546
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,700
what are you gonna do to him?

547
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,400
pass this instrument through his penis
into his bladder.

548
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,800
if he has stones, it will click
against the metal instrument.

549
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,600
assuming i can hear the clicks
above his screams,

550
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:12,500
i will have identified the cause
of his obstruction.

551
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,600
to what fucking end?

552
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,400
to the end that if i think
he will die otherwise

553
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,300
of cutting him open above the pubis
and taking out the stones.

554
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,000
which will probably kill him anyways.

555
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,300
what shall i say to you, trixie,

556
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:33,600
that i'm sure of a happy
outcome for al and every one of us?

557
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,900
minute for us, mr. tolliver?

558
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,600
what is it?

559
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,700
come in and shut the door.

560
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,200
what the fuck is it?

561
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,700
anything you want to tell us, mr. t.?

562
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,900
i told you all i want to tell you outside.

563
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,800
well, believe me, uh,

564
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,300
you don't have waverers
standing in front of you,

565
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,800
or doubters or, uh,
anyone looking for fucking severance.

566
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,900
- just the opposite.
- what does that mean?

567
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,800
you looking for a raise?

568
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
uh, well, what's going on,

569
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
i suppose is leon's question, mr. tolliver.

570
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,300
the truth is, my questions is answered 90%.

571
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,000
and as for the rest,
i'm gonna get good and fucking loaded

572
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,600
and let the devil take the hindmost.

573
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,700
if you fucking walk out of here,
us two are gonna have words.

574
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,900
and more than words at my first opportunity,

575
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,200
because this was 90% his idea to come in here.

576
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:47,900
somebody better turn over a hole card.

577
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,200
both of us took a real
positive impression, sir,

578
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,900
of the talk you give us just
recently here in your office.

579
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,000
yeah, relative to this talk you just concluded.

580
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,800
and?

581
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:12,100
and i guess you'd say a wonderment with us is

582
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,900
if we mistook the tone of
one talk or the other,

583
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,600
and if so, which?

584
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,600
i dispute that one fucking thing changed

585
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,500
between those two talks as to my
attitude and resolve.

586
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,300
did the facts of the camp situation change?

587
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,300
not to my certain knowledge.

588
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,500
but if you're asking in the interim,
have i been privy

589
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,500
to a rumor far as claims being invalidated,

590
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,900
all titles thrown out,

591
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,900
the answer is yes.

592
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,000
well, that would account for it.

593
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
but the only goddamn fact that i'm aware of is

594
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:02,300
i never knew any man ate a rumor
or clothed himself with one

595
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,500
or secured himself a piece of pussy.

596
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,400
well, rumors are not facts.

597
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,700
so if any gutless cocksucker
tumbles to what is going on

598
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,800
and decides he wants to cut and run,

599
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,900
sell his fucking holdings,

600
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,900
you tell him to come see me.

601
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,700
just say cy tolliver will buy whatever
he's fucking selling

602
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,500
if he has that little faith in the camp,

603
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,100
or rumors of judicial invalidation,

604
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,700
or the panic that will ensue from that.

605
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,100
go ahead, boys. go on outside and do your jobs.

606
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,500
that's all we can fucking do right now.

607
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,000
and not waver.

608
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,600
now that's fucking progress.

609
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:07,300
cocksucker upstairs, across the way,

610
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,000
whorehouse where i work--

611
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,800
he is a fucking cocksucker.

612
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,800
--locks the fucking door so people
can't get to help him.

613
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,700
fucking ashamed to be sick!

614
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,100
you know he had a design to murder
that little one.

615
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,200
- no, i didn't.
- hell, yes, he had a design.

616
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,000
charlie and me spirited her from camp,

617
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
forced him to a second victim
more suitable to his cocksucker's purpose.

618
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,100
think they're any different if they've
had their fucking dicks cut on?

619
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,100
they ain't no fucking different.

620
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,500
you got to like their friends or they
won't teach you numbers

621
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,700
or every other fucking regulation they set!

622
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,100
anyways.

623
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,900
far as it fucking goes,

624
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,500
he also brought the cripple
from that orphanage.

625
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,000
uh-- what orphanage?

626
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
and don't buy his bullshit about the 9¢ trick.

627
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,700
- what cripple?
- jewel--

628
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,900
that he says he's got around
against some hooplehead

629
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,300
only having 9¢ and wanting a piece of pussy.

630
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,400
that ain't it.

631
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,400
why she's around is...

632
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,300
it's his sick fucking way of protecting her.

633
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,700
i'm gonna get whiskey.

634
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,300
there's entries on both
side of the fucking ledger

635
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,600
is the fucking point,

636
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,400
as i already talk like a fucking jew!

637
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
shaping up to be a nice cool evening.

638
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,300
maybe he has a good side to him too

639
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,800
that i entirely fucking missed.

640
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:58,100
it's always fucking possible,
drunk as i am fucking continuously.

641
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,600
it's nice to see you.

642
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,800
- you returned his timepiece.
- yes.

643
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,800
i thought i had told you.

644
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,700
you did, miss isringhausen.

645
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,800
i'm recurring to the topic,

646
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,700
hoping you will be more expansive.

647
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,100
he accepted the timepiece, ma'am,

648
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,800
and raised another subject

649
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,500
you and i ought pursue at some
different moment.

650
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:44,300
must i credit the right of that "ought," miss isringhausen,
or may i suspect

651
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,600
you enjoy setting terms?

652
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,200
terms, ma'am?

653
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,200
playing arbiter of the when and why of things.

654
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,000
pursuing the second subject mr.
bullock raised, mrs. garret,

655
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:02,700
might upset a person now present,
junior to you and me.

656
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,200
i cannot imagine how such a pursuit

657
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,400
could be any more upsetting than the atmosphere

658
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,700
of relentless disapproval
that you so consistently generate.

659
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,900
i've no further need of your services,
miss isringhausen.

660
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,400
i'll say goodnight then to you and sophia.

661
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,800
my preference is your saying goodbye.

662
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,000
i wonder, ma'am...

663
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,300
if having made so many decisions so quickly,

664
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,100
your patience may be short just now.

665
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,800
and i'd appeal to you to reconsider
your preferences in the morning

666
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,900
in any case,
you'll want to retire to your room.

667
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,400
i hope you'll recall that i've traveled from chicago to enter your employ

668
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,000
 and have no emergent prospects. 

669
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
we'll come to some arrangement.

670
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,200
all right.

671
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,300
i'll say goodnight then.

672
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,300
as is your custom--

673
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:01,100
without having spared one affectionate
look for my child.

674
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,300
my training, ma'am,

675
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,500
is that being engaged to see to
the child's education,

676
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,300
my soliciting her affections

677
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,700
would intrude on the mother's province.

678
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,300
and i would call that a logical distinction,

679
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,000
miss isringhausen, having
nothing to do with the way people live.

680
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,900
the people downstairs are scared.

681
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,400
are they?

682
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,000
off your talk.

683
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,100
they think you believe the camp's in jeopardy.

684
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,100
i ain't answerable for misinterpretations.

685
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,500
the truth is, lila,

686
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,100
the weather is getting better,

687
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,300
and it looks to stay mild a spell.

688
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:04,200
old cy has outlasted the
cocksuckers one more time.

689
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,500
if it was in me to kid myself,

690
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,200
i'd take this for proving god loves me.

691
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,400
i believe he loves us.

692
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,200
do you, sweetheart?

693
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,800
did his hand
lead me buying and turning you out?

694
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,400
that's a lovely thought.

695
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,100
next you're in touch,
would you put the good word in?

696
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,200
i do.

697
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,800
i pray for you every night.

698
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,400
all right, stupid,

699
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,500
time to shut your fucking mouth.

700
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,500
shut your fucking mouth now

701
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,500
and turn over and close your eyes.

702
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,700
lift your leg.

703
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,200
languid and open for adventure.

704
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:15,800
in your case, atlantis,
present the tits a little more.

705
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,200
- can you hold that for half an hour?
- i've been holding this my whole fucking life.

706
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,600
- mr. w.
- hello.

707
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,500
you jumped the gun on our opening
by half an hour,

708
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,800
but i believe we can make an exception.

709
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,400
my partner joanie.

710
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,500
- how do you do?
- how do you do?

711
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,500
our caller fancies basil's bourbon, joanie,

712
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,800
which is hid beneath the floorboard at the bar.

713
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,500
all right.

714
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,200
won't you sit?

715
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,400
i don't know that i will.

716
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,500
- where is she?
- carrie's been detained.

717
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,400
detained? 

718
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,300
you don't need me
telling you carrie's mind's her own.

719
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,800
we hit cheyenne and she stopped
to see a relative.

720
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,500
basil hayden hid beneath the
floorboards as advertised.

721
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
would you get out of my sight, please?

722
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,900
how close a relative is
she fucking in cheyenne?

723
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:17,300
- she's coming soon, mr. w.
- is her arrival imminent?

724
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,600
a matter of days.

725
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,500
how many days are in a matter?

726
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,300
would fucking something else fill the time?

727
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,900
yeah, how much you cost?

728
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,700
i ain't for sale, sir.

729
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,300
but i would fuck you for free.

730
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,200
i have to say you ain't my type.

731
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:31,900
do you stand there, mr. w.,

732
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,800
saying you're dead solid sure

733
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,200
you'll not ever again be surprised

734
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,800
till you've completed your earthly course?

735
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,500
ain't that presumptuous, sir?

736
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,500
and ain't our quoted fee,
to surprise you, fair and just?

737
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,500
i always pay for pussy.

738
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,000
well, i may let you then,
if you go ahead and twist my arm.

739
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,400
you pay extra for that?

740
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,400
do unhand me.

741
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,900
i, mr. w. -- who i just unhanded--

742
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:02,600
and mr. basil hayden do
not wish to be disturbed.

743
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,100
you want me back where i was?

744
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,700
she kills that fucking cocksucker,

745
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,400
i'm gonna be working for the rest of my life.

746
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,400
richardson, richardson, richardson.

747
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:24,400
when will come the quiet
hours of our declining years?

748
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,500
i'm talking to you, dimwit.

749
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,700
i wasn't listening.

750
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,300
richardson, won't you sit yourself?

751
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,900
allow me to take up your labors.

752
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:44,400
i am confiding that turbulence,

753
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,300
upheaval of the most violent sort,

754
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,200
churning seas, waves of a scale and force

755
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:55,400
to make the most seasoned
seafarer vomit

756
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,800
are in prospect for this camp.

757
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,500
and, we, richardson, you, i,

758
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,800
and tragically others--

759
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,500
so very many others

760
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,500
who journeyed to the hills to stake
their claims,

761
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:14,800
and with those claims their
hopes for the future--

762
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:19,200
are but pawns of the savage sea

763
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,300
and playthings of the fucking deep.

764
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,600
not for us, apparently,

765
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:34,900
the placid harbor, on which voyages,
near complete

766
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:37,900
to bob and rot, bob and rot,

767
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,800
be calmed.

768
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:44,300
for us, to the very end,

769
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:47,100
the dizzying surges of the storm

770
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,700
and its crashing descents!

771
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:53,600
do you understand me, you repulsive lout?

772
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,500
- no.
- the claims, richardson.

773
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,800
they're being overturned.

774
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,300
save those few who dispose of their holdings

775
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,100
before word circulates.

776
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,100
destitution looms!

777
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:12,600
oh dear.

778
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:17,000
yes, yes. even you now recognize the situation.

779
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,400
ah well.

780
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,100
take the rest of the night off, richardson.

781
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,600
thank you, sir.

782
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,200
but confide in no one!

783
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,400
about the claims!

784
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,400
would we have even more fun naked?

785
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,600
or i could, and you could stay dressed.

786
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,200
or the opposite.

787
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,800
who am i?

788
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,100
you're mr. w.

789
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:52,100
your boss struck bigger than
anyone in the comstock and mexico.

790
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,700
so you being here puts a shine to this
camp's prospects.

791
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,300
unbutton my shirt.

792
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,800
yes, sir.

793
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,800
do not look at my face.

794
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,500
no, sirree.

795
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,900
shall i tell you who i work for?

796
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,500
as you wish.

797
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,200
if you do, how shall i occupy myself
while you're doing it?

798
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:29,200
the same as if i don't.

799
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,600
for me to judge?

800
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,400
as you wish.

801

802
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,300
or shall we advance to these buttons here?

803
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:50,900
and shall i hazard an approach i rarely
find ill-received?

804
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,900
no.

805
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:02,800
shall i hazard an approach i myself,
i never remember refusing?

806
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:05,700
and will you supervise closely?

807
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,400

808
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,200

809
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,900

an amusing mind.

to bring you stories of the world of men.

813
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:56,600
i'll just be here in my girl's
world diddling myself.

814
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,300
i admire you coming armed.

815
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,100
i'm gonna pass this through your
penis up into your bladder, al,

816
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,800
and i'm gonna say this to you once--

817
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,100

824
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,000

825
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,100

827
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,400

828
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:12,000
to release your water,
so you push now if you can, son.

829
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,500

00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,900
- you take it out of him!
- shut up!

834
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,000
all right.

835
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,800
i can see some fucking urine with the blood.

836
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,700
good for you.

837
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,200
is he all right now? is he cured now?

838
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,400
it's fucking something, anyway.

839
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,600
is that something anyway, doc?

840
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:10,400
all right, al, i'm gonna take it out of you.

841
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,900
you hold on and it won't hurt so bad.

842
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:28,400
he put something out of himself, trixie.

843
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,300
now, that's something anyway.

844
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,600
is it out of him?

845
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,900
well, that instrument is out of him.

846
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,200
and what of the fucking stone?

847
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:44,500
i didn't see no fucking stone come out.
