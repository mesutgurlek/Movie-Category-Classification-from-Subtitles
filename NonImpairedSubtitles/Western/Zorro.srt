1
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,641
Ole, guapa.

2
00:02:00,426 --> 00:02:01,484
Bueno.

3
00:02:11,304 --> 00:02:12,931
Ole.

4
00:02:15,342 --> 00:02:17,970
Ole. Viva Espana.

5
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,479
Ole.

6
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:21,871
Ole.

7
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,119
Ole.

8
00:02:31,593 --> 00:02:32,753
Ole.

9
00:02:41,838 --> 00:02:44,500
Forgive me, Senorita
may l tell you how divine you are?

10
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,565
You are most kind.

11
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:48,203
Would you have
a glass of wine with me?

12
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:50,713
-ls this man annoying you?
-No.

13
00:02:50,748 --> 00:02:52,875
He has merely
invited me for a drink.

14
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,907
Senorita Fuentes is occupied tonight.

15
00:02:54,952 --> 00:02:56,818
Who is this man?
What is he to you?

16
00:02:56,855 --> 00:02:57,879
Nothing.

17
00:02:57,922 --> 00:03:00,823
lf the Senorita joins my party,
it's no concern of yours.

18
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:03,919
-You'd be wise to keep out of this.
-l do not want a scandal.

19
00:03:03,962 --> 00:03:06,362
But the lady does not
want your company.

20
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:07,626
And l do not want yours!

21
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:30,980
-Shall l stop the fight?
-Not yet. This may be interesting!

22
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:35,052
-The stranger is an expert swordsman.
-This is an affair of honor!

23
00:03:35,096 --> 00:03:36,393
Let them go.

24
00:03:46,141 --> 00:03:47,438
You've killed him!

25
00:03:48,977 --> 00:03:51,276
Take this man to the cuartel.
Lock him up!

26
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,645
At once.

27
00:03:58,221 --> 00:04:02,625
A regrettable incident. Rest assured,
his aggressor shall not go unpunished!

28
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:10,958
You call yourself soldiers?

29
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:12,697
You cannot handle one man?

30
00:04:12,737 --> 00:04:14,295
Throw him in a cell!

31
00:04:16,107 --> 00:04:17,938
He is like a tiger!

32
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:20,137
Why did you not stop the fight sooner?

33
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:21,840
l've a plan, Garcia.

34
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:24,543
This hot-blooded stranger
gave me an idea.

35
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:28,111
-He's going to help me eliminate Zorro!
-Oh.

36
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:32,751
Steady, Tornado, steady.
Easy, boy.

37
00:04:32,793 --> 00:04:34,488
Easy, hold it.

38
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:36,257
Good boy, Tornado.

39
00:04:36,296 --> 00:04:39,356
Now we can get on with the training.
Everything clear?

40
00:04:45,006 --> 00:04:46,337
Take cover!

41
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,317
No, Tornado. No fair, peeking.
Get back.

42
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,478
Good boy, Tornado. You found me!

43
00:05:26,518 --> 00:05:29,316
You're getting to be
a pretty smart horse.

44
00:05:29,354 --> 00:05:31,379
No one lives around here.

45
00:05:31,423 --> 00:05:34,392
By the saints!
l may have discovered Zorro's hideout.

46
00:05:49,443 --> 00:05:51,604
Hold it, Tornado. Easy, boy.

47
00:05:51,645 --> 00:05:54,239
Steady, Tornado, steady.

48
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:56,044
Easy, boy, easy.

49
00:05:58,887 --> 00:06:00,718
Soldiers? Did they see you?

50
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:03,289
Cover for me.
l will get Tornado out of here.

51
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:55,706
What are you doing out here?

52
00:06:56,316 --> 00:07:00,219
Oh, never mind. He is deaf and dumb,
and l know l heard someone whistle.

53
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:03,451
Search everywhere.
He must be here somewhere.

54
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:05,118
Look behind that big rock.

55
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,988
GARCIA: Look over there!
Keep searching.

56
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,896
Do not overlook anything.

57
00:07:24,514 --> 00:07:26,778
Oh, never mind. lt is him.

58
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:28,443
lt is him whistling.

59
00:07:29,252 --> 00:07:30,651
Stop searching.

60
00:07:32,322 --> 00:07:35,348
Oh. You can save us a trip.

61
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:39,427
l have a letter here
for Don Alejandro.

62
00:07:39,463 --> 00:07:41,158
Let me... Oh, yes.

63
00:07:41,198 --> 00:07:44,430
See that he gets it.
Oh, thank you!

64
00:07:47,072 --> 00:07:49,563
Come on, muchachos.
We have more letters to deliver.

65
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:07,491
This is the height of irony.

66
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:10,724
After everything the Comandante
has done, he is trying to make amends.

67
00:08:11,431 --> 00:08:14,299
''We request the pleasure
of your company

68
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,963
''at the dinner for the
leading citizens of our community.

69
00:08:17,004 --> 00:08:20,098
''8:00 tonight at the
posada of Los Angeles.''

70
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:22,405
Well, l certainly am not going!

71
00:08:22,443 --> 00:08:25,413
lf the leading citizens are going,
you should go.

72
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:27,813
l refuse to honor him
with my presence.

73
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,308
Not to honor him, so much,
but at the same time, not to offend him.

74
00:08:31,353 --> 00:08:35,050
l will write a polite note
declining his most kind invitation.

75
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:38,387
Oh, uh, have Bernardo wait for it.

76
00:08:42,132 --> 00:08:43,690
You heard the invitation?

77
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:46,631
A dinner for leading citizens.

78
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,901
l wonder what new deviltry
is the Comandante up to?

79
00:08:50,774 --> 00:08:53,436
When you deliver my father's answer,
see what you can find out.

80
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,713
Open the cell door.

81
00:08:59,751 --> 00:09:02,015
The Comandante wishes to see you.

82
00:09:04,823 --> 00:09:07,155
How much longer
must l endure this humiliation?

83
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:10,424
That is what the Comandante
wishes to discuss with you now.

84
00:09:18,205 --> 00:09:19,263
Come in!

85
00:09:20,707 --> 00:09:23,540
-Let no one disturb us, Sergeant.
-Si, Comandante.

86
00:09:25,112 --> 00:09:28,138
Last night you promised me freedom
in exchange for a favor.

87
00:09:28,182 --> 00:09:31,118
-What is the favor?
-You are a daring, impetuous man.

88
00:09:31,152 --> 00:09:34,087
Quick with a blade,
too quick for your own good.

89
00:09:34,122 --> 00:09:35,987
-l had to defend my honor.
-Naturally.

90
00:09:36,024 --> 00:09:39,552
And the lady in question
is most attractive, though fickle.

91
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:42,120
Come to the point, Capitan.
What am l supposed to do?

92
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:46,994
You have heard
of the mysterious outlaw, Zorro?

93
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:50,268
The champion of the people.
His fame has spread to Monterey.

94
00:09:50,307 --> 00:09:51,774
He is a blackguard and a bandit!

95
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:54,709
Then put him in your
filthy cell instead of me.

96
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:57,577
-Or can't you catch him?
-l haven't been able to.

97
00:09:57,614 --> 00:09:59,241
The people are protecting him.

98
00:09:59,282 --> 00:10:01,843
They regard this scoundrel
as their friend.

99
00:10:01,886 --> 00:10:04,548
When, in reality,
it is you who are their friend?

100
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:06,580
Exactly!

101
00:10:06,624 --> 00:10:08,717
Tonight l am giving
a dinner at the tavern.

102
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:12,355
lt's only for the large landowners
and a few rancheros as well.

103
00:10:12,397 --> 00:10:15,525
You will appear,
without invitation, of course,

104
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:18,127
as the masked bandit, Zorro.

105
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,762
Does this appeal to you?

106
00:10:19,805 --> 00:10:22,206
Anything appeals to me
that gets me out of here.

107
00:10:22,242 --> 00:10:24,642
Excellent! Come into
my quarters, please.

108
00:10:31,317 --> 00:10:33,286
l have a copy of
the disguise Zorro wears.

109
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,515
l should like you to put it on.

110
00:10:35,556 --> 00:10:37,649
The cloak.

111
00:10:37,691 --> 00:10:40,558
-Now the hat.
-ls it becoming?

112
00:10:40,594 --> 00:10:41,788
Quite dashing.

113
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:46,200
-Hmm.
-And now the mask.

114
00:10:46,234 --> 00:10:48,498
Hardly the material
l would choose for myself.

115
00:10:48,536 --> 00:10:51,630
-lt is better than prison garb.
-How do l look?

116
00:10:52,507 --> 00:10:54,408
The resemblance is extraordinary!

117
00:10:54,443 --> 00:10:57,606
-Yes, you will do very well.
-Just what will l do?

118
00:10:57,647 --> 00:11:00,309
You will rob my guests,
even the poor ones.

119
00:11:00,349 --> 00:11:02,408
Make it a point to
mistreat the servants.

120
00:11:02,451 --> 00:11:04,784
A blow with the flat
of my sword, perhaps?

121
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:07,881
-Or shall l cut off an ear?
-Anything that pleases you.

122
00:11:07,924 --> 00:11:11,382
We must discredit Zorro with all classes
so they will not protect him.

123
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:13,020
l will easily capture him.

124
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:16,090
After l have thoroughly proved
what a monster Zorro is,

125
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:19,126
-l am allowed to escape?
-You will vanish in the night.

126
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,865
-lt sounds simple.
-lt is simple.

127
00:11:20,905 --> 00:11:24,636
My guests will be unarmed.
Garcia will be stationed at the front door

128
00:11:24,676 --> 00:11:26,167
to see you are not interrupted.

129
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:29,442
Suppose a guest objects
to being robbed?

130
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,245
Then you will, of course,
defend your honor.

131
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:34,878
l bow to a true friend of the people.

132
00:11:47,168 --> 00:11:49,830
Well, we meet again, eh?

133
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,739
Ah, the Comandante is over at the
posada getting everything ready.

134
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,776
The com...

135
00:11:58,747 --> 00:12:01,147
Come with me.
This may require an answer.

136
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,550
-lnnkeeper!
-Yes, Senor Comandante?

137
00:12:10,593 --> 00:12:12,993
-You have a tablecloth, l hope?
-Tablecloth?

138
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:16,624
You idiot! Do you expect
my guests to eat from bare boards?

139
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:20,125
-Do you have a large tablecloth?
-The finest, Comandante!

140
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,728
That is more like it.

141
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:25,299
Esperanza, take the sheets
off the bed in number three.

142
00:12:25,342 --> 00:12:27,537
Oh, si, Senor, si.

143
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:35,209
Comandante, this is the servant
of the de la Vega hacienda.

144
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:36,515
He brought this letter for you.

145
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,493
Don Alejandro de la Vega regrets
that he cannot accept my invitation.

146
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,657
He shall come
whether he wishes to or not!

147
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:47,961
Have him wait for a reply.

148
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,435
lnnkeeper! Bring me
a pen and ink, quickly!

149
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,335
At once, Senor Comandante.

150
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:57,075
-l've made arrangements for the trap.
-Shh.

151
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,911
Oh, don't worry about him.
Remember, he is deaf and dumb.

152
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,381
Watch.

153
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:07,483
See? Deaf as a post!

154
00:13:13,362 --> 00:13:15,227
Give me that doubloon.
lt is mine.

155
00:13:15,264 --> 00:13:17,129
lt's a payment on what you owe me.

156
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:20,135
But it is all l have.
Now l cannot buy a single drink!

157
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:22,070
You never worried about that before!

158
00:13:29,813 --> 00:13:33,272
Please, Capitan, could l have
a little advance on my pay?

159
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:35,251
l will give you an extra month's pay

160
00:13:35,286 --> 00:13:38,278
if we are successful
in destroying Zorro tonight!

161
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,407
Apparently, this is a reply
from the Comandante.

162
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,268
''l cannot accept your refusal
to attend my dinner.

163
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:05,081
''lt is imperative that a representative
of every family be present.

164
00:14:05,118 --> 00:14:06,779
''Do not fail to attend.''

165
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,118
This is not an invitation!
lt is an order!

166
00:14:09,156 --> 00:14:11,647
So like the Comandante,
so lacking in tact.

167
00:14:11,692 --> 00:14:14,058
l still refuse to go!

168
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:18,031
Senor Alcalde, those books l promised
to lend you, l shall get them for you.

169
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:23,669
Should l humble myself in order
to avoid Monastario's displeasure?

170
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:26,266
No. l wonder what
the purpose of this dinner is.

171
00:14:26,308 --> 00:14:28,640
Whatever the purpose,
it cannot be for our welfare!

172
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,150
No, no, no. Not so fast. Now,

173
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:41,384
begin at the beginning.

174
00:14:44,127 --> 00:14:46,027
You... You met Sergeant Garcia?

175
00:14:48,432 --> 00:14:51,833
He took you to the tavern?
Don't tell me he bought you a drink!

176
00:14:56,507 --> 00:14:58,237
Capitan Monastario was there.

177
00:15:01,013 --> 00:15:03,880
He read my father's letter
and became angry. l can imagine!

178
00:15:08,221 --> 00:15:10,280
He said something about Zorro? What?

179
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,187
Going to slit his throat?

180
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,899
Going to shoot him?

181
00:15:24,538 --> 00:15:26,836
Oh! They're going to hang him!

182
00:15:36,151 --> 00:15:37,880
Poison him?

183
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:40,882
Well, shoot him or hang him or...

184
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,515
lt seems they intend to destroy him.

185
00:15:45,061 --> 00:15:47,120
All right, Mr. Oh-So-Clever-One.

186
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:49,461
Now l know the reason for that dinner.

187
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:53,458
They're setting a trap. And for some
reason they expect Zorro to be there.

188
00:15:53,503 --> 00:15:56,404
Very good, Bernardo.
Let us not disappoint them.

189
00:16:12,257 --> 00:16:14,054
Here they are. l'd mislaid them.

190
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:15,185
Thank you, but l...

191
00:16:15,227 --> 00:16:18,594
About the Comandante's dinner.
You do not have to go.

192
00:16:18,631 --> 00:16:22,693
The invitation says a representative
of each family. l'll go in your place.

193
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,874
l'm sorry, the tavern
is closed for the evening.

194
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,471
The Comandante
is giving a private party.

195
00:16:41,822 --> 00:16:45,418
Honorable Alcalde of the pueblo
de Los Angeles, caballeros,

196
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,826
it is indeed gratifying
that not one person

197
00:16:47,863 --> 00:16:50,093
failed to accept
my humble invitation.

198
00:16:50,132 --> 00:16:52,862
All of our leading families
are represented here.

199
00:16:52,901 --> 00:16:57,236
Don Alejandro de le Vega was
unable to attend because of illness.

200
00:16:57,273 --> 00:16:59,639
But he sent his son in his place.

201
00:16:59,676 --> 00:17:03,134
You have perhaps wondered
why l invited you here tonight.

202
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:05,512
The purpose is to promote
the feeling of harmony

203
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:07,380
and mutual respect in our community.

204
00:17:07,951 --> 00:17:10,044
During the year
l have been Comandante,

205
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:13,250
several regrettable
misunderstandings have taken place.

206
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,885
Some of you may feel
that l have been overzealous

207
00:17:15,927 --> 00:17:18,020
in the administration of my office.

208
00:17:18,063 --> 00:17:21,055
Caballeros, let me assure you,
with my hand on my heart,

209
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:23,659
that l have only done my duty
for the glory of Spain

210
00:17:23,702 --> 00:17:26,103
and devoted service
to our noble monarch.

211
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:28,129
Caballeros, l propose a toast.

212
00:17:28,174 --> 00:17:29,732
To His Majesty, the king!

213
00:17:29,775 --> 00:17:31,470
ALL: To the king!

214
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:40,184
And now that we have
sealed our friendship,

215
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,053
drink and be merry.
On with the entertainment!

216
00:18:12,622 --> 00:18:15,090
Everyone line up over there!
Move! Quickly!

217
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:18,353
You too!
lnnkeeper, over here!

218
00:18:21,398 --> 00:18:23,093
Pick it up, you clumsy lout!

219
00:18:24,101 --> 00:18:26,399
-Oh.
-Collect their valuables.

220
00:18:26,437 --> 00:18:28,166
Yes.

221
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:30,197
Never mind the musicians.
They never have money.

222
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,941
l'm sorry, Don Diego.

223
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,251
No violence, please, Senor Zorro!

224
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,719
You're making a mistake.

225
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:53,891
You're making a mistake.
l'm a poor man!

226
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:55,993
Without your life's blood,
you would be much poorer!

227
00:19:10,385 --> 00:19:11,910
Get me my clothes.

228
00:19:12,454 --> 00:19:15,514
A man in there is impersonating Zorro,
robbing the people.

229
00:19:17,893 --> 00:19:20,589
Please do not take my jewelry.
lt was my mother's.

230
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:22,928
Would you rather have
your pretty throat cut?

231
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,498
Canalla.

232
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:57,634
l thought you were already inside!

233
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,763
Hurry up. l'll hold the ladder for you.

234
00:20:00,273 --> 00:20:02,173
l'll be in front when you escape!

235
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:28,494
Put it in my sash.

236
00:20:35,011 --> 00:20:36,376
Stand back. He's mine!

237
00:20:44,021 --> 00:20:47,617
You fool! What did you come back for?
Fight me and make it look good!

238
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,217
You're overdoing it.

239
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,152
Zorro!

240
00:22:09,214 --> 00:22:11,409
-What's going on here?
-Look!

241
00:22:15,688 --> 00:22:19,089
-Two Zorros! Which one is ours?
-l know the real one!

242
00:22:30,137 --> 00:22:32,332
Don't interfere. He is mine!

243
00:23:11,949 --> 00:23:13,974
Adios, Senor lmpostor!

244
00:23:37,144 --> 00:23:40,636
This is not Zorro. This is the stranger
that killed Romero in the duel!

245
00:23:40,681 --> 00:23:43,377
-He took our money.
-Yes, and here it is!

246
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:45,112
How did he get out of jail?

247
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,380
Well...

248
00:23:47,054 --> 00:23:49,148
Sergeant Garcia, explain yourself!

249
00:23:49,891 --> 00:23:53,088
-Capitan, you know very well that...
-Silence! Not a word!

250
00:23:53,128 --> 00:23:56,256
Take this man to his cell.
See that he does not escape this time!

251
00:23:56,297 --> 00:23:58,061
Si, Comandante.

252
00:23:58,701 --> 00:24:01,431
Up, prisoner! March!

253
00:24:03,205 --> 00:24:05,435
Oh, Senor Alcalde.
Here is your watch.

254
00:24:05,474 --> 00:24:07,942
-Muchas gracias!
-Your jewelry, Senorita.

255
00:24:07,977 --> 00:24:09,309
-Gracias.
-This...

256
00:24:09,346 --> 00:24:14,181
This ring belongs to Don Diego.
Don Diego? Don Diego, where are you?

257
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:16,508
Here l am!

258
00:24:17,087 --> 00:24:20,353
l saw no reason in allowing that bandit
to get away with everything!

259
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:26,219
-Here is your ring and your purse.
-Thank you.

260
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,959
l think l'd better be leaving.

261
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:32,904
Oh, Comandante, thank you
for a delightful evening.

262
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,133
lf you'll excuse me
for leaving so early...

263
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:38,166
Well, l just haven't
been myself all evening.
