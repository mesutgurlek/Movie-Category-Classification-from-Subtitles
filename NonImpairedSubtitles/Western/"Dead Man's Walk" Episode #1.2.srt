2
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,794
Sometimes I feel
like a motherless child.

3
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,709
Sometimes I feel
like a motherless child.

4
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,676
Sometimes I feel
as a motherless boy

5
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,392
when I'm away from home.

6
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,509
Saw the face of Falconer

7
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,634
when Colonel shot him?

8
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,599
It was quiet,
and stopped.

9
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,233
Equal to all.

10
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,592
No one expects them to kill a man

11
00:01:45,593 --> 00:01:47,075
to please an Indian.

12
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,954
I was a captain.

13
00:01:48,955 --> 00:01:52,354
The logic was judging him before.

14
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,086
Had his trial

15
00:01:55,087 --> 00:01:56,758
the trial of Colonel.

16
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,878
What happens to an army

17
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,397
when Colonel is crazy?

18
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,115
I had to impress
Buffalo Hump.

19
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,203
I wanted to demonstrate

20
00:02:07,204 --> 00:02:08,195
who has courage.

21
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,958
If an Indian who has come
,

22
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,552
no mercy.

23
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,310
This Indian does not have mercy,

24
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:16,638
courage with or without it.

25
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,751
I think the Colonel is crazy.

26
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,470
Killing someone is not being crazy.

27
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,359
Believe in whatever you want,

28
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,433
I believe you're crazy.

29
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,570
Sometimes I feel I'm almost dead.

30
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,834
Sometimes I feel I'm almost dead.

31
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,910
Sometimes I feel I'm almost dead

32
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,750
when I'm away from home.

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,871
When I'm away from home.

34
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,417
Sometimes I feel

35
00:03:08,418 --> 00:03:11,559
as a boy without a mother.

36
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,010
Sometimes I feel

37
00:03:14,011 --> 00:03:16,671
as a boy without a mother.

38
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,562
Sometimes I feel

39
00:03:18,563 --> 00:03:20,992
as a motherless boy

40
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,075
when I'm away from home.

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,070
- Shad?
- What?

42
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,871
Will you marry?

43
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,635
I?

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,718
It depends on the girl.

45
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,191
What if the girl
were me?

46
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,729
I thought you wanted

47
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,314
go to California, Mattie.

48
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,713
What would you?

49
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,153
I'm a weirdo.

50
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,912
I have dry source.

51
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,646
Yes, I want to go
to California.

52
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:19,199
This is what most want.

53
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,152
But there we could go together?

54
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,232
They say the grapes are very sweet it.

55
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,909
There are many young people here.

56
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,476
Why do you want an old dog?

57
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,991
You're the one I want.

58
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,590
With you I was going blind.

59
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,751
It's a good girl.

60
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,716
Yes, me
marry you.

61
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,393
Maybe we'll find a preacher.

62
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,360
Come on, guys.
There is still much.

63
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,077
Watch your cart.

64
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,080
How much farther
to return to their land.

65
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,344
With another dish of beans,

66
00:05:39,345 --> 00:05:40,554
'll get quick to Austin.

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,865
I told you
never arrive.

68
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:45,994
You who insisted on coming.

69
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,558
Return home.

70
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,797
The open spaces do not attract newcomers.

71
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,301
Here are the bankers

72
00:05:57,302 --> 00:05:58,635
players and professionals.

73
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,438
E prostitutes.

74
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,916
All but the Big Texan.

75
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,796
- Mattie left.
- Removed?

76
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,071
Whores retire?

77
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,752
Mattie yes.
Is Shad's wife.

78
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,839
- Do not try to imply.
- So what if I do this?

79
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,770
Shad will kill you.

80
00:06:22,771 --> 00:06:25,353
I do not mind carrying someone.

81
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,353
Shadrach is an old man.
Surraria he wanted.

82
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,789
- Maybe.
- You are not my friend?

83
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,714
I did not say other than,
said "maybe".

84
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,313
Mr. Wallace.

85
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,149
Mr. Wallace.
Have something to bite?

86
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,589
Bites?

87
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,113
I was doing my needs

88
00:06:57,114 --> 00:06:59,197
when a scorpion attacked me.

89
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,878
They threw him a curse.

90
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,673
First stumbles with the suitcase

91
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,997
and now a scorpion bites you.

92
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,438
Lord on this earth
everything is sharp.

93
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,019
Let's see Sam.

94
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,156
Has a lotion that heals everything.

95
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,518
What are delicious.

96
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,412
If you do not find a buffalo,

97
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:21,037
bring us a good fat pig.

98
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,191
Wonder where are the buffalo?

99
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,030
It makes no
week there were thousands.

100
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,441
With the rains will have to wait

101
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:41,189
a week to cross the Brazos.

102
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,793
You waited,
but not buffalo.

103
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,837
There were several thousand.

104
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,311
Could have been one or two.

105
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,311
We killed the last head of cattle.

106
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,674
We'll have to eat porridge to Santa Fe

107
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,271
You see better.
Who goes there?

108
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,675
- Three horses.
- No

109
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,157
A Buffalo and two horses..

110
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,119
Behind them!

111
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,592
- Bill.
- What?

112
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,872
- Bill.
- What?

113
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,068
Indians!

114
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,914
Indians!

115
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,434
Indians!

116
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,238
Comanches!

117
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,394
Must be a record.

118
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,315
Two Indians chase a buffalo

119
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:24,235
for a camp and not fire.

120
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,656
They were so tired and hungry

121
00:09:26,657 --> 00:09:27,995
who have not seen us.

122
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,952
I saw, but we are united
,

123
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:32,510
a stake of torture.

124
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,233
Shad's right.

125
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,515
At least we have a buffalo

126
00:09:36,516 --> 00:09:38,271
and we can forget the porridge.

127
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,310
- Let carnear it.
- Yes let's go.

128
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,472
Fortunately you have a good aim.

129
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,333
I have had enough,
I go home.

130
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:52,957
If the Austin,
'll go with you.

131
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,432
Keep it up!
Keep it up, come on!

132
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,153
Take care, idiots!

133
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,318
Stop the cart!

134
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,264
It will be a headache

135
00:11:19,265 --> 00:11:20,950
load it on the horses.

136
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,260
Shit! I knew it was better to use

137
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:28,794
oxen instead of mules.

138
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,872
The oxen are slow.

139
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,595
Colonel. Look.

140
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,590
Who can be in the wilderness?

141
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,553
What do you say?
Night is not and can not be good.

142
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,836
- Is Charlie Goodnight.
- Who is? Do not know.

143
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,678
Very soon you know.

144
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,979
Hello, I'm
Charlie Goodnight.

145
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,196
This is Bill and this is Bose.

146
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,937
What do these carts with
?

147
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:08,715
This was not made for them.

148
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,918
Why not take some coffee?

149
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,636
We're not used to visitors.

150
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,621
I'm sorry,

151
00:12:13,622 --> 00:12:15,832
these girls were abducted

152
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,691
and their parents will be quiet no

153
00:12:17,692 --> 00:12:18,588
until they see them.

154
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,350
Did not answer me on the wagons.

155
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,238
Lord, do not know
Who are we?

156
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,073
. I did not recognize
General Lloyd.

157
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,155
It's too drunk to travel.

158
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,845
Us shipment
Texas to Santa Fe.

159
00:12:31,846 --> 00:12:33,553
Let's go to New Mexico.

160
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,352
We want to win it.

161
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,566
We'll have to hang some

162
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:41,230
Mexicans,
but win.

163
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,518
They hang you.
If it will arrive.

164
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,152
Why did not we were going to get?

165
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,236
This is the Great Rock.
Then nothing.

166
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,193
Nothing.

167
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,560
There will be grass anyway.

168
00:12:55,561 --> 00:12:57,072
Sure there is something.

169
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,639
That yes, a lot of grass.

170
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,590
But it's been 15 years that I am ranger

171
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,679
and did not know anyone

172
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,238
you can live grass.

173
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,964
Not seen a horse

174
00:13:06,965 --> 00:13:09,075
scroll 600 km without water.

175
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,673
600?

176
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,944
I was told that there is a step

177
00:13:13,945 --> 00:13:14,950
behind the Red River.

178
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,714
Yes, it is true, but not behind the Red
.

179
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,433
Not behind the Red
?

180
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,551
Not behind
Large Wichita.

181
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,673
The Great Wichita.

182
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,035
I told you
was not in the red.

183
00:13:33,036 --> 00:13:35,311
Just shifting sands
.

184
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,711
I never trusted that Pawnee.

185
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,799
We lost and will attempt

186
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,634
us take the horses.

187
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,032
Hello, Shad.
Complied with the 100?

188
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,758
I lack little, Charlie.

189
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,276
- Miss. Roberts.
- All right, Charlie?

190
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,728
Wallace, for who wants to go to

191
00:13:54,729 --> 00:13:56,839
New Mexico wants to be hanged?

192
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,938
There are forces in Texas?

193
00:13:57,939 --> 00:13:58,877
Not let it hang me.

194
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,759
They will wish the gallows
Buffalo Hump catch you.

195
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,989
's Comanche territory.

196
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,191
This is for them
not for you.

197
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,556
I came to rescue these

198
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,079
children and return home.

199
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,958
I would advise you to do the same.

200
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,454
Please
provisions for them.

201
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,348
I will do you evil, can eat.

202
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,874
Thank you.

203
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,335
Care.

204
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:28,878
Do not let Wolf
Kicker steal their horses.

205
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,748
They will have to eat them to get

206
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:31,679
to New Mexico.

207
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,637
<I> Let the Boston </ i>

208
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,590
I hear the parrot.

209
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,516
Charlie Goodnight's funny.

210
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,514
I've seen.

211
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,635
Dec.

212
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,795
Dec.

213
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,273
Bad news.

214
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,148
How can you be good?
What happened now?

215
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,404
Bs and gives Alchise
gone.

216
00:15:18,405 --> 00:15:19,797
Took ten horses.

217
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,436
Fucking bastards!

218
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,989
You can get them?

219
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:29,198
I want to hang the two on a mast.

220
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,794
Go after them!

221
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,878
Take the two cables!

222
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,193
This is bad.

223
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,228
Yes.

224
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,960
- Where are you going?
- Come.

225
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,790
This is the Palo Duro Canyon
.

226
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,078
It seems that not
never ends.

227
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,949
There is no food for
reach Santa Fe.

228
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,198
'll Let escape these thieves.

229
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,237
The Comanches are in charge of them.

230
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,958
Call, go tell that to Colonel
.

231
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,872
Gus and I will look for a descent.

232
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,914
Soon. We'll have to catch these
buffalo.

233
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,269
Come on!

234
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,588
God!

235
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,069
Come on!

236
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,992
Colonel! Colonel!

237
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,839
- I saw some Indians!
- Were Comanches.

238
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,415
We came to a canyon filled

239
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,799
buffalo,
hundreds of them.

240
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,871
Gus and Wallace are
looking for a shortcut.

241
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,449
Good news. Sam!

242
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,755
See if you can get this arm

243
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,990
and then we will kill some buffalo.

244
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,832
I do not know how many
Comanches may be.

245
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,718
Does not matter.
We rescue them.

246
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:08,436
's A good day to fight.

247
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,750
- Let behind the Buffaloes!
- Yup!

248
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,236
We saw 20 Indians,
but there could be thousands.

249
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,039
We can kill 20,
but thousands do not know.

250
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,112
Not want to lose such meat.

251
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,355
The canyon is very steep,

252
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,353
not want to climb it with
Buffalo Hump following me.

253
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,878
- What do we do?
- Camping and watch.

254
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,976
Perhaps the Comanches are gone and

255
00:19:49,977 --> 00:19:51,875
can kill some buffalo.

256
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,635
Let's go.

257
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,674
- Tell the Colonel.
- No, tell him.

258
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,068
Let's go.

259
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,949
Colonel.

260
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,514
Colonel.

261
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,994
- We lose...
- Twenty horses.

262
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,594
It's as if the earth had swallowed them
.

263
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,672
Not swallowed them,
Wolf Kicker stole.

264
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,637
Would steal a horse up in a store.

265
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,132
He shall put on the tail of a


266
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:38,553
Horse until
mate to kick.

267
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,836
With a name like Wolf Kicker

268
00:20:40,837 --> 00:20:42,076
would very well.

269
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,518
- Colonel, look.
- What?

270
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,039
Fire!

271
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,280
You'd better go back to the last stream!

272
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,949
Collect all!

273
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,665
Come on, guys!

274
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,240
Gather everything and go!

275
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,873
Quiet, boy!

276
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,591
Quiet, horse!

277
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,871
Right!
Go fast!

278
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,517
- They closed the circle!
- In the push into the canyon!

279
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,591
- We're surrounded!
- We have to jump!

280
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,593
- There is no room?
- No, we're stuck.

281
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,296
The canyon is not so steep!

282
00:22:05,297 --> 00:22:07,598
Let's go down
and resist!

283
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,512
The ravine, guys!

284
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,468
Come on, Beelzebub.

285
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,232
<I> Let the Boston </ i>

286
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,518
Caution!
I've got you!

287
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,877
- Carefully.
- Yes

288
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,319
God..
Sam this tired.

289
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,970
We lost the dentist.

290
00:23:41,971 --> 00:23:44,995
Try not have toothache.

291
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,199
Look.

292
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,392
Is Buffalo Hump.

293
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,191
- Damn, gunpowder!
- Yes, the shooting is over.

294
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,713
Buffalo Hump.

295
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,471
Where are the Indians?

296
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,120
If provoked another fire,

297
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:40,358
end up baked like rabbits.

298
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,825
Are not you worried?

299
00:25:45,826 --> 00:25:48,114
Thought much on the bad.

300
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,566
I thought I wanted to be a ranger,

301
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:51,917
but met this girl.

302
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,721
Now I am sure that only thinks

303
00:25:53,722 --> 00:25:54,992
in the business of fabrics.

304
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,371
I was thinking about girls,

305
00:25:57,372 --> 00:25:58,956
except in
die burned.

306
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,388
Being a ranger
means it can die.

307
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,473
If you do not want to use it
can leave it.

308
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,429
Shit!

309
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,357
What did you do?

310
00:26:15,358 --> 00:26:17,115
I could have hit him with the butt.

311
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,548
This deer was young.

312
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:25,350
I doubt run over 3 km.

313
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,269
If we pursue it,
can kill it.

314
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,869
Absolutely.

315
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,998
Matilda, do not be long.

316
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,749
Shadrach!

317
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,155
Wallace!

318
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,353
Where the hell are you?

319
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,739
Mattie.

320
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,398
Course they camped and slept.

321
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,719
It is hard to steer this
day of plain

322
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,036
how they will do night
?

323
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,835
Only been out one night.

324
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,351
Perhaps they fled.
May not come back.

325
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,669
Where?

326
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,268
We are in the midst of the plain.

327
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:42,998
No
to go.

328
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,839
This is dead.
If they come back, I think of killing them.

329
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,602
Why do this two batters

330
00:29:47,603 --> 00:29:48,639
to follow a deer?

331
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,074
Is unknown.

332
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,599
A what?

333
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,315
An unknown,
something that is not understood.

334
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,872
As two batters
are following a deer.

335
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,837
Better to be two to one.

336
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,345
I would not go without someone who could

337
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:05,910
find the way back.

338
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,559
Shad never lost,
of night or day.

339
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,269
If not returned
it is because he died.

340
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,748
Sure that bastard killed him.

341
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,354
And if it was, why not
wanted to take me with him.

342
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,232
Love is cruel sometimes.
Okay, Mattie?

343
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,199
Not!

344
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,238
Not!

345
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,543
Mattie said he would marry

346
00:30:58,544 --> 00:31:00,836
so find a preacher.

347
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,549
We're married.
The preacher would be the icing.

348
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,751
It is risky to remove a whore.

349
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,847
Especially when traveling

350
00:31:12,848 --> 00:31:14,834
so many tough guys.

351
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,997
Mattie if retreated alone.

352
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,952
And who meddle with it
have to do with me.

353
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,508
I'm too old to go cold.

354
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,476
Also,
I always liked Mattie.

355
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,550
Know her a long time.

356
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,315
Yes.

357
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,293
I met her on the first day

358
00:31:46,294 --> 00:31:47,876
I got to Missouri.

359
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,712
A few ten years.

360
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,991
I led a group
St. Louis to Santa Fe.

361
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,038
People of the fur company.

362
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,477
His father was a drunk.

363
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,286
One night got drunk,

364
00:32:04,287 --> 00:32:05,917
she fell into the river and drowned.

365
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,073
Her mother came into
fever a few days later

366
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,273
and Mattie was orphaned.

367
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:21,598
There were 50 men and no
were no angels.

368
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,777
The head of the caravan said

369
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:28,274
her to prostitute
or left.

370
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,118
Were times difficult.

371
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,821
Yes
So there was no place

372
00:32:38,822 --> 00:32:41,076
for ladies in the West.

373
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,996
There was only for whores.

374
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,877
- And they did not hold long.
- Mattie yes.

375
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,033
Mattie has courage.

376
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,958
Remember the turtle
that took?

377
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,236
The scare that gave everyone.

378
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,673
It is very strong.

379
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,114
Fished you, Shad.
And it's over.

380
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,836
Yes, fished me,
Bigfoot.

381
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,952
I'll be with the Mattie
until I live.

382
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,678
- Shad!
- This is my girl.

383
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,599
I thought had died.

384
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,296
Hart was faster

385
00:34:05,297 --> 00:34:06,832
expected,
linger to catch.

386
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,433
- Where the hell were they?
- Where do you think?

387
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,529
No one told you

388
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,795
Ago I was a deer!

389
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,996
If I had a
handcuffs, arrest them.

390
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,151
To me you do not
arrest ever.

391
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,634
I'll put a bullet in you.

392
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,711
I am Colonel, can not
ignore my orders!

393
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,440
Not Colonel, is no longer
a pirate land.

394
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,097
The expelled sea and now

395
00:34:28,098 --> 00:34:29,433
tries to hack Santa Fe.

396
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,477
I do not take orders from you, Cobb.

397
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,312
Shadrach also think so.

398
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,326
We'll see if I can not chain it

399
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:40,153
when you split you.

400
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,674
Quiet!

401
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,160
Are you crazy?

402
00:34:54,161 --> 00:34:56,790
We need every man to survive.

403
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,270
It is better to book
to the Comanches.

404
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,276
Drop that knife, Bigfoot.

405
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,392
- Release!
- It's ok.

406
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,074
Okay.

407
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,239
But I keep on
command, understand?

408
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,718
I do not know how I rejoice.

409
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,228
Meta your orders
where you see fit.

410
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,512
- Why fight?
- For hungry, I suppose.

411
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,090
I have so much, that even I

412
00:35:29,091 --> 00:35:30,911
would give a stab someone.

413
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,991
We can eat the deer.

414
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,799
Once we cook.

415
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,871
There'll hold one more day without food.

416
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,918
I take these two wires
to see if we hunt something.

417
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,152
Whatever you give you will.
But remember one thing:

418
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,269
If they catch you,
not say how many we are.

419
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,518
What believe that we are thousand.

420
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,508
I do not think
assume the all-powerful army.

421
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,345
What we would capture

422
00:36:14,346 --> 00:36:15,997
the only way to follow alive.

423
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,884
Let me catch up what

424
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:19,436
Had caught me food.

425
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,478
Come on, guys.

426
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,118
For my mother, a buffalo.

427
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,358
Caution,
slowly.

428
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,394
Not scared.

429
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,113
I shoot first.

430
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,077
If you do not fall,
shoot you.

431
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,157
Behind the front paw.

432
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,237
Shit!
Why does not fall?

433
00:37:33,238 --> 00:37:34,680
I got it completely twice.

434
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,068
Me too!

435
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,273
How to know you hit?
Is half blind.

436
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,353
Let's go.

437
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,517
Poor ignorant!

438
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,718
The mountains are there.

439
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,531
Where there are mountains there is snow

440
00:37:52,532 --> 00:37:53,793
and where there is snow, water.

441
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,736
They want to go where there is nothing.

442
00:37:55,737 --> 00:37:56,449
Die!

443
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,030
For there is the Canadian and

444
00:37:58,031 --> 00:37:59,830
sure there is water at this time.

445
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,514
The Canadian is
walking one week.

446
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,156
What do you think drinking
for a week?

447
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,353
Scream all you want.
Come and let us now.

448
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,599
They are crazy!

449
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,777
If you do not die of hunger
,

450
00:38:13,778 --> 00:38:15,074
the Comanches will kill them.

451
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,152
It's crazy, Turner!

452
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,833
They are all crazy!

453
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,479
There are partridges?

454
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,988
Well, son.

455
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,476
Gus. Gus.

456
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,714
Why do not you stop?
We have three.

457
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,711
Come on, Gus.
Stop fire!

458
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,475
You have three.
And what others have?

459
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,630
Where did you learn to throw stones as well?

460
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,311
If you practice a lot,

461
00:39:40,312 --> 00:39:42,431
can hit on everything that point.

462
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,498
If you shoot so well,

463
00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:47,713
why not shot the buffalo?

464
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,868
I've never seen anything like it.

465
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:56,234
It was a buffalo
spellbound.

466
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,510
Why do you think
ran?

467
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,516
I think that we are demons.

468
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,067
Caleb Cobb could win

469
00:41:51,068 --> 00:41:52,790
this state, if
got here.

470
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,553
Here I see soldiers.

471
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,427
Can drink.

472
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:13,278
Texas is far away.

473
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,959
I'm the captain Salazar.

474
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,357
Unhook the weapons and we will not do them harm.

475
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,998
What welcome.

476
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,109
This is not good welcome.
It is an arrest.

477
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,310
We let the arrest.

478
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,756
Best arrested than dead.

479
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,273
They're brats.

480
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,659
One that would have won

481
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,193
if not caíssemos this ambush.

482
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,283
Captain
is not a brat

483
00:42:57,284 --> 00:42:58,678
and had a good gun.

484
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,172
The walls are mud.

485
00:43:03,173 --> 00:43:05,914
We could dig a hole.

486
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,320
And where were going, Woodrow?

487
00:43:08,321 --> 00:43:09,551
Not seeing this?

488
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,275
Almost died of hunger on the way.

489
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,516
So far, we ridicule
in every battle.

490
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,671
Well, we're alive.

491
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,999
We can learn.

492
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,127
This should be part of Mexico

493
00:43:29,128 --> 00:43:31,114
that is not full of gold and silver.

494
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,462
I told you not to expect

495
00:43:38,463 --> 00:43:39,718
find gold and silver.

496
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:09,435
Try to sleep.
We leave early.

497
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,072
I can not sleep thinking of the boys.

498
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,876
Gus and Call are young.

499
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,029
I'm afraid not return to see them.

500
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,644
No, certainly will
headquarters

501
00:44:29,645 --> 00:44:31,310
but and who does not?

502
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,917
Stop worrying.

503
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,779
They were with Bigfoot Wallace,

504
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,634
the best batsman I know.

505
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,636
Will bring them soon and safe.

506
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,674
Bigfoot.

507
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,073
It's good,

508
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,630
but is not the best.

509
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,360
The best are here,
with me.

510
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,130
Roncaria equal even though they were

511
00:45:25,131 --> 00:45:26,392
about to hang him.

512
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,471
Well, if
hang him,

513
00:45:30,472 --> 00:45:31,950
is better than snore.

514
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,870
Good morning, gentlemen.
We have a ways to go.

515
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,271
That delay, make a
hour dawned.

516
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,820
I had a trial.

517
00:45:50,821 --> 00:45:52,477
Then bring the convict.

518
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,753
It gives Bs.

519
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,351
What made this thief?

520
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,231
Stole a ring from
governor's wife.

521
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,342
So come so far,

522
00:46:14,343 --> 00:46:16,434
to steal the gold and silver.

523
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:27,077
I think the Colonel had
right about silver.

524
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,035
But I said nothing of the shootings.

525
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,215
At least we will see Santa Fe.

526
00:46:32,216 --> 00:46:33,592
They say it's very beautiful.

527
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,637
Never Summer Santa Fe

528
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,715
Let's south,
where your friends,

529
00:46:38,716 --> 00:46:40,355
and we will take them to St. Lazarus.

530
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,599
Where is Saint Lazarus?

531
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,236
Step Along the North.
800 kilometers.

532
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,718
- How many?
- The 800

533
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,029
- What cold.
- Yes.

534
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,536
Has lived very well.

535
00:47:23,537 --> 00:47:24,717
There is cold.

536
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,445
Within two months it will do so cool,

537
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:30,198
this summer look.

538
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,678
Looks like a buffalo.

539
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,595
It's a bear!

540
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,195
There is a bear
any, is a grizzly bear.

541
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,894
Do not look and run!

542
00:48:07,895 --> 00:48:09,669
I can not run with chains!

543
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,990
- For jump!
- Run!

544
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,318
It's amazing how the horse
hit the bear.

545
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:25,119
Nothing could topple.
We did a favor.

546
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,441
We have done walking

547
00:48:27,442 --> 00:48:29,070
until leave lame.

548
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,675
Hopefully it has been pleased

549
00:48:31,676 --> 00:48:33,112
with the horse and not follow us.

550
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,232
Why would you go?

551
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,320
Maybe eaten Texans

552
00:48:38,321 --> 00:48:39,991
before and like our taste.

553
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,589
Then I would eat the Woodrow.

554
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,155
He's from Texas and I
Tennessee.

555
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,789
It will be better to wait it stops raining.

556
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,433
I do not know where we are.

557
00:48:50,434 --> 00:48:52,509
I see someone
someone moves.

558
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,072
I hope not to be the bear.

559
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,675
If it was the bear,
would have devoured us.

560
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,392
Are people from Salazar.

561
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,916
What we do?
Kill or leave them?

562
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,900
If you are unarmed,

563
00:49:12,901 --> 00:49:15,876
can not kill them in cold blood
.

564
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,438
One of them gave us coffee.

565
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,277
I think not seek
fight.

566
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,599
Just want to escape the bear
like us.

567
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,352
You can go home!
Come on!

568
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,381
We will not have time

569
00:49:32,382 --> 00:49:34,519
to chats!
Long!

570
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,792
Not understand.
Come on!

571
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,309
Come on!

572
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,591
I hope not follow us.

573
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,594
If the bear wants us
hunt in the hunt.

574
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,471
Can follow you with the smell.

575
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,189
It could be three meters from us.

576
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,956
They are very silent

577
00:50:03,957 --> 00:50:05,953
if they are not angry as before.

578
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,433
I hope you do not come.

579
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,822
A friend was eaten by a

580
00:50:10,823 --> 00:50:12,078
bear in the river Trinity.

581
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,716
We heard the tracks.

582
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,229
Eaten?
As?

583
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,231
The ate and left.

584
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,316
Why do not you
account that?

585
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,636
Willy was fishing

586
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,755
And the bear came by
back in silence.

587
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,877
I had no idea

588
00:50:35,878 --> 00:50:37,633
of the bear
walked around.

589
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,876
They are so silent,
who do not realize.

590
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,192
The eaten all at once.

591
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,874
- Including the buckle.
- The buckle?

592
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,116
Yes
had a buckle in eagle form.

593
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,515
I always liked

594
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,990
Willy was dead and had no family,

595
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,300
but that bear ate

596
00:51:00,301 --> 00:51:03,154
no avail Willy hide.

597
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,435
That was all.

598
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,708
I see a light.

599
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,948
Is a fire.

600
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,552
Yes, but who?

601
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,315
Could be Indians or Mexicans.

602
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,038
We will wait to dawn.

603
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,791
And if you see that bear?

604
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,519
I would rather die of a gunshot

605
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,112
that destroyed by a bear.

606
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,033
Gus, do not forward
or lose.

607
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,079
You make them,
I'm out.

608
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,597
Shut up, they can hear you.

609
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,718
- He was whispering.
- For awaken the dead.

610
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,472
Who's there?

611
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,634
Billy? It's us.

612
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,032
- Are you?
- Yes, let's approach.

613
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,789
No, wait
a moment.

614
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:21,238
I have to think about it.

615
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,716
Bill, we are.
What's to think?

616
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,355
Bigfoot said that the Comanches

617
00:52:27,356 --> 00:52:28,954
can mimic voices.

618
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,912
Could be Comanches.

619
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,991
I'm not Comanche,
am Gus McCrae.

620
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,558
Yes, I do
that is yes.

621
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,792
Forgive me my nerves.

622
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,554
I'm a little nervous.
In front.

623
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,558
There's nothing to eat?

624
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,109
No

625
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,934
. We ha
two days without eating.

626
00:53:17,935 --> 00:53:19,870
Shad is very weak.

627
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,638
And his parrot, Colonel?

628
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,029
Beelzebub?

629
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,998
Ate it.

630
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,717
We made a soup.

631
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,110
Gathered nationwide.

632
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,198
How many are left?

633
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,355
Thirty with you.

634
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,512
But that's not the worst.
That left few bullets.

635
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,190
I'll have to kill ten
with every shot.

636
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,122
The truth is that this adventure

637
00:55:03,123 --> 00:55:05,916
does not seem the same since we made soup

638
00:55:05,917 --> 00:55:06,914
with Beelzebub.

639
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,055
Is equal to the first time

640
00:55:12,056 --> 00:55:13,790
I left, nobody
know what to do.

641
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,119
Now we are worse than with Major Chevallie.

642
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,717
Guess I'll have

643
00:55:27,718 --> 00:55:29,634
a little chat with this
general.

644
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:32,954
I need the flag.

645
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:34,719
Why do you need a flag?

646
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,907
Since you brought this fret,

647
00:55:36,908 --> 00:55:38,072
why not use it?

648
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,068
- Maybe impress.
- I have it.

649
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,234
Call Cable, tie his rifle.

650
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,755
You and McCrae cable
accompany me.

651
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,755
If this general
have a little

652
00:55:49,756 --> 00:55:52,031
education, we will take
breakfast.

653
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,589
Let's go.

654
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,192
Gus, keep me
a piece of bacon.

655
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,913
Die for a piece.

656
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,799
Have good luck.

657
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:21,871
Shad, could kill them.

658
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,828
- They're stupid.
- Come on, Mattie, quiet.

659
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,091
Are with the flag of the republic
,

660
00:56:28,092 --> 00:56:28,988
will not kill them.

661
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,713
Care.

662
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,193
They will not kill us.

663
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,645
We're three, would be cowards

664
00:56:58,646 --> 00:57:00,629
if they had just us.

665
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:04,916
- Do not rely too.
- Ignore the infantry.

666
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,226
Do not look for them.

667
00:57:07,227 --> 00:57:09,274
Let's get right to the head.

668
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,126
Congratulations, gentlemen.

669
00:57:26,127 --> 00:57:27,479
Escaped bear.

670
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,676
Normally I
the fusillade,

671
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,284
but you can not blame anyone

672
00:57:32,285 --> 00:57:33,308
for running away from a bear.

673
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,072
I see you already know
.

674
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,439
We traveled together.

675
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,873
I am Colonel Cobb,
want to see the general.

676
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,713
I'll introduce you.

677
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,787
Can download the flag?

678
00:58:10,788 --> 00:58:12,316
We know who we are.

679
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,195
Willing to take the breakfast?

680
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:21,110
We have eggs.

681
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,998
Thank you ever ate.

682
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:26,311
- I can offer them a coffee?
- Yes please.

683
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,318
What's this?

684
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,719
Do not eat anything since
those partridges.

685
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,575
These people have everything.

686
00:58:37,576 --> 00:58:39,151
We have nothing.

687
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,450
Do not eat with the enemy while

688
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:43,154
our eat the belt.

689
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,277
It's not our fault that
not have come here.

690
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:51,637
Drink this
coffee and think about what you lost.

691
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,313
Ate?

692
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,516
They were offered, but refused
.

693
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,914
I do not think in curling

694
00:59:25,915 --> 00:59:27,148
my friends are hungry.

695
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,756
I see.
A very noble attitude.

696
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,019
I prefer to be selfish. I took

697
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:35,078
a big morning coffee with fried eggs.

698
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,234
I would like to go.

699
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,450
I can not.

700
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:41,551
I surrendered to General Dimasio.

701
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,439
I promised that

702
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,759
if depusermos the weapons, not die.

703
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,195
I do not think lay down their arms until
kill me.

704
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,791
Do not be insolent, Corporal.

705
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,269
When I give an order,
must obey.

706
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:56,807
You're too young, not let

707
00:59:56,808 --> 00:59:58,040
to die for nonsense.

708
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,237
I would rather die fighting
to be bound by chains.

709
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,064
If you decided to die,

710
01:00:07,065 --> 01:00:09,079
I am willing to please him.

711
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,437
I killed for disobeying me Falconer

712
01:00:11,438 --> 01:00:12,875
and I will do the same to you.

713
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,553
Drop the gun, Woodrow.

714
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,118
Colonel, you are a coward
.

715
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,832
Could watch this man
until you calm down?

716
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,278
It is very restless.

717
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,576
Cable McCrae, go
where this troop

718
01:00:41,577 --> 01:00:43,358
and lay down their arms.

719
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,000
And tell them to eat that will give

720
01:00:46,001 --> 01:00:47,511
once they have surrendered.

721
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,199
I will, but can be
they do not like.

722
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,069
I do not think repeat the Alamo.

723
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,029
Colonel Travis was crazy
, a brave crazy,

724
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,792
but at least I had a church.

725
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,076
We have nothing!

726
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:14,992
This war is over.

727
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,871
Go now.
Sooner go,

728
01:01:22,872 --> 01:01:24,835
take before breakfast.

729
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,117
Where are you going now?

730
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,912
I go to Santa Fe
With this army..

731
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,114
General said that the governor

732
01:02:36,115 --> 01:02:37,158
wants to meet me.

733
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,639
Me
He plans to throw a party.

734
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,358
- Put the gun down, sir!
- No!

735
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,478
It is my prisoner, not yours.

736
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,073
Let me go!

737
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:16,275
- What are the orders?
- Depor weapons.

738
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:19,798
Caleb This is a pig,
to have surrendered.

739
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,033
What do you think, Shad?

740
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,834
We can flee to the hills
and take refuge in.

741
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,998
Survive a few,

742
01:04:26,999 --> 01:04:28,988
should load but a few.

743
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,164
Would not survive anyone.

744
01:04:31,165 --> 01:04:32,877
Maybe respected Mattie.

745
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,115
I do not want to live without Shad.

746
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,830
- I'm hungry.
- Yeah, me too.

747
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,195
I surrender to me
give breakfast.

748
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,316
Sure we put in row

749
01:04:47,317 --> 01:04:49,273
and kill us, but I want to take
breakfast.

750
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,518
I hope you cook well.

751
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:57,999
Well, guys, are many.
We surrender.

752
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,792
Is brave but foolish.

753
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:26,235
Your colonel had no
choice but to surrender.

754
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,709
His men have
ammunition or food.

755
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,995
If you do not surrender,
would have died.

756
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,798
I hate Caleb Cobb.

757
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,198
At least now there will be

758
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:37,637
so beautiful at the banquet.

759
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,938
Not you too not after

760
01:05:39,939 --> 01:05:41,839
receiving 100 lashes.

761
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,938
If you want to talk with your friend,

762
01:06:06,939 --> 01:06:08,352
the McCrae cable,
on.

763
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,599
I'll talk to him later.

764
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,112
You may not
there is a later.

765
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,393
I hope to live.

766
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,254
If you end up with the Call,

767
01:06:26,255 --> 01:06:28,872
I swear this
goat will not live.

768
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:02,598
- My God, you are alive.
- It is amazing.

769
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,910
Few men would have survived.

770
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,197
You'll live to bury you.

771
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,949
It is very strong.

772
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,526
If endure three days,

773
01:09:00,527 --> 01:09:02,635
survive and will walk to St. Lazarus.

774
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,717
Not listen.

775
01:09:04,718 --> 01:09:06,634
He said he will live to bury you.

776
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:12,837
- Died?
-. I'm alive.

777
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,112
But still in danger.

778
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,389
Woodrow shall never die.

779
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,750
- Tomorrow the cable walk.
- It is impossible.

780
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:53,556
I brought him the wagon
to warm up.

781
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,755
Shadrach neither should walk.

782
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:02,117
You'll have to burn the cart

783
01:11:02,118 --> 01:11:03,750
or someone freeze.

784
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,711
All men must go.

785
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:08,992
The cable walk.

786
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,429
Apache Indians.

787
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,266
Yes, you're right.

788
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:47,635
We are in Apache territory.

789
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,757
This is the work of
chief apache Gómez.

790
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:57,596
He only would a general way.

791
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,495
Most
Apache Indians

792
01:11:59,496 --> 01:12:00,798
sell,
but they did not.

793
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,394
It's not your law.
It is normal to violate.

794
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,755
I do not see Colonel
by any party.

795
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,840
Of course the coward
escaped.

796
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,195
Boys!

797
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,314
Colonel?

798
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:16,509
Boys?

799
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,191
Are you?

800
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:28,111
These Apaches demons

801
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:31,080
blinded me with thorns.

802
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:36,715
They broke my leg
and abandoned me.

803
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,356
In surprised at dawn.

804
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:50,271
Now we are in La Jornada del Muerto.

805
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,630
Is terrible even for a sane man.

806
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,726
Many die crossing,

807
01:12:55,727 --> 01:12:56,873
can be everyone.

808
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,274
We can not take it,

809
01:13:01,275 --> 01:13:03,195
should take care of us.

810
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,278
I'm lame.

811
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,313
I will not stay.

812
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:13,895
Give me a horse and

813
01:13:13,896 --> 01:13:16,030
soldier and I'll get to Santa Fe

814
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,102
We can not take you

815
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,638
and not let
back.

816
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:24,272
If I give you a horse,

817
01:13:24,273 --> 01:13:26,355
Gómez will find it and it will be worse.

818
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,388
- I'll take that risk.
- But I do not.

819
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,626
You are a brave,

820
01:13:34,627 --> 01:13:37,516
put the end of his career.

821
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:49,879
I am a sailor.

822
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,998
I never thought to die in the desert.

823
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:00,192
Should be in my ship.

824
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,512
What the hell am I doing here?

825
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,596
I know it's a big
pirate, Colonel Cobb.

826
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:15,069
Stole many treasures of Spain.

827
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:16,468
Yes.

828
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,717
And I lost the game.

829
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:29,113
Give me the gun and
continue their way.

830
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:38,471
Texans are angry with me for having surrendered.

831
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,429
Me enforcariam if they could.

832
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:47,393
Would be happy nagging them killing me.

833
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,071
Wallace, the best
place is in the eye?

834
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:53,909
Yes.

835
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,459
It's not my lucky day.

836
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,109
There remained eyes.

837
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,471
I think it will be worth it.

838
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,114
Behind them!

839
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,679
Get the guns!

840
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,473
- Colonel, shoot them!
- I'll kill them!

841
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:21,035
Is shooting at us, Colonel!

842
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,493
Do not move.

843
01:15:51,494 --> 01:15:54,437
Does not seem very serious.

844
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:58,878
This is the end.

845
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,388
Not true,
just need rest.

846
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:04,993
I'll take care of you.

847
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,270
It's a great woman, remember.

848
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,416
I just feel there on

849
01:16:16,417 --> 01:16:18,871
married and before he died.

850
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,872
It does not matter.

851
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,549
We were well married, Shad.

852
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,832
Do not worry.

853
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:36,749
Not!

854
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:40,754
Shad.

855
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:49,588
Shad! my God.
What happened to you?

856
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,194
Mattie.

857
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:05,197
- Shad died. .
- No

858
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,319
It's the truth.

859
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,274
No

860
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,376
I can not support
,

861
01:17:13,377 --> 01:17:15,359
was the only one he had.

862
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:23,439
Mattie, sad,

863
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,391
but may be the best.

864
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:32,234
I was too weak to cross the desert.

865
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,876
I would not have survived.

866
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,598
Would have died,
as almost everyone.

867
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,472
We are lucky.

868
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:08,999
You do.

869
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:10,573
If the bullet hit him two

870
01:18:10,574 --> 01:18:11,619
Centimeters to the right,

871
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,599
would like Shad.

872
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:17,036
Life is very curious, Captain.

873
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,951
The Shad had shot in
best shooters from the west.

874
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,998
And then this,
killed by a blind.

875
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,539
They were to meet for a long time.

876
01:18:45,574 --> 01:18:47,513
My Shad?

877
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,910
Since I was 14.

878
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:59,039
My parents and I

879
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,496
put ourselves heading north,

880
01:19:01,497 --> 01:19:02,600
en route to Santa Fe

881
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:05,792
Shad was one of the guides.

882
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:13,831
It was the most beautiful
man he had ever seen.

883
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,469
Mom and Dad died.

884
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,317
Shad always took care of me,

885
01:19:25,318 --> 01:19:26,755
more than anyone.

886
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,491
If it were not for him I

887
01:19:32,492 --> 01:19:34,150
would not have survived.

888
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,084
I gave a buffalo hide

889
01:19:40,085 --> 01:19:41,875
if by chance she were cold.

890
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:55,470
Well, it was a great shooter
.

891
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,753
And I could follow
any trace.

892
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:06,919
Yes, it was so.

893
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,274
I did not want him for that.

894
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,712
Shad was honored.

895
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,673
They are not
honorable men.

896
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,912
On the plains, no.

897
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:36,552
I think never
I will have the same fate.

898
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:21,748
Captain.

899
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,532
We will all die if we

900
01:21:25,533 --> 01:21:27,479
to sleep through this time.

901
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,238
How long is this city?

902
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,337
I've never been in San Sebastian.

903
01:21:33,338 --> 01:21:34,715
Just know that it is.

904
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,834
Continue without me,
I am delaying you.

905
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:43,356
Shut up, Woodrow,
not let you.

906
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,511
How can so cold?

907
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,429
I've never been in such a cold place
.

908
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,279
I hurt your feet.

909
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,510
I do not know if I can continue.

910
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:56,999
I'm with you.

911
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,149
If you are late,
I will get you.

912
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:18,285
Why do not you loose
, Captain?

913
01:22:18,286 --> 01:22:20,269
We will not survive.

914
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:29,308
I can not drop it, Mr. Wallace
,

915
01:22:29,309 --> 01:22:30,355
have orders.

916
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,244
Absurd orders.

917
01:22:33,245 --> 01:22:35,350
His men also die.

918
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,339
I did not say my orders

919
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:39,553
were smart.

920
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:43,197
I soldier 20 years and almost all

921
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:44,994
my orders were absurd.

922
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,354
I almost died by absurd orders.

923
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,388
And now gave me an absurd
,

924
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:58,118
you laugh if
not feel so much pain.

925
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:01,432
I can not let them go.

926
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,128
