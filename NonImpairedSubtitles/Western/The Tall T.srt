1
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,151
Pa! Pa!

2
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,091
Yeah, I see him.

3
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,064
Jeff! Jeff!

4
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:24,344
Morning, Mr. Brennan!
- Morning, Jeff!

5
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,412
Pa thought you was somebody else!

6
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:30,617
But I knew it was you. Soon as I seen
the claybank, I knew it was you.

7
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,886
You got young eyes, Jeff.
- You headed for Contention?

8
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:36,122
Any water in that well of yours, I am.

9
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:39,092
This animal of mine ain't had a drop
since Sasabe Creek.

10
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,894
Can I water him for you? Can I?
- Lf you like.

11
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:44,264
Good morning, Pat!
- Good morning, Hank!

12
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,066
Mr. Brennan's going to Contention.

13
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:51,671
Are you expecting company, Hank?
- Been a station man too long, I guess.

14
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:56,191
Getting so I cock a hammer
for near no reason at all.

15
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,117
Now mind you, don't let him drink
too much of that, Jeff, warm like he is.

16
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:07,702
You know I'm going to walk him first, Pa.

17
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,926
You've got a fine boy there, Hank,
he knows his stock.

18
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:16,329
He'll make a first-rate station man one day.

19
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,498
Not if I can help it, he won't.

20
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,367
Ain't a fit life being stuck off
in the middle of nowhere.

21
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:25,571
All the time by yourself knowing
nobody but stage drivers and shotguns.

22
00:03:25,671 --> 00:03:26,939
Ain't no fit life at all.

23
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,377
I always thought you were happy at it.
- Well... Thanks. I was.

24
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,980
When Jeff's mother was alive, I was.

25
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,018
Alone, it's different. My retire time
comes up next fall and I'm going to take it.

26
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:43,056
Man shouldn't ought to be stuck off by
hisself in this kind of country, Pat.

27
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,223
It ain't natural.

28
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:46,793
You wouldn't be half-meaning me
by that, would you, Hank?

29
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,195
Well, come to think of it, I guess I do.

30
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:52,365
It ain't right, your working that spread
of yours all alone.

31
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:55,635
I can't afford to hire
hands. Not yet, anyway.

32
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,338
Still a lot of building to do,
fences to run and such.

33
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,873
But if I get too lonely, Hank,
I can always talk to my stock.

34
00:04:00,973 --> 00:04:07,093
Well, when they start talking back to you,
just remember what I told you.

35
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,716
I figure one bucket's enough, Mr. Brennan.

36
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:13,986
That ought to hold him, Jeff. Well, I
better get going before that sun goes high.

37
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:17,457
What takes you to Contention, Pat?
- Hope to get me a seed bull.

38
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,159
That is, if Tenvoorde
will part with him at my price.

39
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,629
Tenvoorde! You still trying to do
business with that old goat?

40
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:27,961
I'm still trying. Thanks for the water.
- Sure!

41
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,101
Mr. Brennan!

42
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:38,338
Could you wait just a minute, please?
- Sure, son.

43
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,821
If it ain't too much trouble,

44
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,561
I'd sure wish you'd buy me
some striped candy.

45
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:58,798
Jeff, Mr. Brennan ain't got time
for that kind of foolishness.

46
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:02,197
Sure he does. Any special flavor, son?

47
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,504
I'd be mighty proud of cherry.

48
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,834
Cherry it is.

49
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,300
See you!
- Good luck!

50
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:24,580
Pa, what's it like in Contention?

51
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,626
There's people there, Jeff. Lots of people.

52
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,290
Excuse me!

53
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,120
Morning, Patrick!
- Rintoon!

54
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:02,628
I'm pointing toward the saloon.
Care to join me?

55
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:04,864
Like to, can't. Kind of short on time.

56
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,400
Well, it looks to me
like a big land owner like you

57
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,968
ought to be able to do as he pleases.

58
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:12,834
Not quite. But I can't say as I mind it.

59
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:19,143
Hey, Pat. Why'd you buy up on the Sasabe?
- No exact reason.

60
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:20,713
One day it just come to me.

61
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:24,250
Figured it was time I had something
of my own. It ain't much. Just a start.

62
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,553
You know,
that Sasabe Creek country is wild.

63
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:32,525
No more than working for Tenvoorde.
- Well, he did ride you a little rough.

64
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,660
And I never could figure that out.

65
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,364
But you know,
to the back of you, he'd always brag

66
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,200
and he'd say
you was the best ramrod he ever had.

67
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,935
I was the only one who would stay with him.

68
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,571
No, it was a lot more than that.
He thought a lot of you.

69
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,306
He thought a great deal of you.

70
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:53,609
I never did notice.
You still driving for Hatch & Hodges?

71
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:57,850
Well, ain't no choice.
The only stage line left in the territory.

72
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:02,054
You know, they're laying tracks over yonder
faster than a nervous hen.

73
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:05,324
They're going to be in Bisbee,
them rails, in about a month.

74
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,425
I heard that.

75
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:08,494
Yeah, they building them
a depot down there.

76
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,963
I was sitting down there
talking to a fella the other day.

77
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:14,433
He says it won't be long,
you'll get on one of them trains

78
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:19,739
and just go lunkedy-plunk all the way to
Tucson without even stopping once.

79
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,275
Why, it'll be coming in here in Contention
before long.

80
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,911
When that day comes,
you can hire on at my place, Ed.

81
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:28,147
Well, I'll take you up on that.
Come on, join me in that drink.

82
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:32,051
Nothing I'd rather, but being a man of
property, there's things I gotta do.

83
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:36,989
Well, what's more important than a drink?
- Well, for one thing, cherry striped candy.

84
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,089
See you, Ed.

85
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,259
Candy?
- Rintoon!

86
00:07:53,572 --> 00:07:57,508
Morning, Willard! Ma'am.

87
00:07:57,576 --> 00:08:00,846
I understand you'll be driving
our stage this afternoon.

88
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:04,116
Well, I'll be driving one, but I didn't know
it was going to be yours.

89
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:09,355
I... That is, Mrs. Mims and I have hired
the coach to take us to Bisbee.

90
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,491
You going to have a whole Concord
for yourself?

91
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:17,776
Why don't you wait for the regular run?
It'll be by here at...

92
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:22,894
Mrs. Mims?
- Doretta and I were married this morning.

93
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,037
We'll be ready to leave promptly at 3:00.

94
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,473
I trust you'll notify
Hatch & Hodges to that effect.

95
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:31,544
And see to loading our luggage.
- You're trusting the wrong man.

96
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,814
I ain't doing no loading
and I ain't keeping up no schedule.

97
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:40,186
You can just trot yourself right down to
the company store and ask the dispatcher.

98
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:43,778
You took yourself a fine woman.
- Rintoon,

99
00:08:44,356 --> 00:08:47,960
when I pay for a coach,
I expect the service that goes with it.

100
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:54,350
You ain't half right, Willard,
seeing that you ain't the one that's paying.

101
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,511
I figured you'd want to keep
the few customers you got, Rintoon.

102
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,813
I can do without his kind, if it was up to me.

103
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:08,914
Who is he, anyway?

104
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:13,348
Old man Gateway's son-in-law,
as of this morning.

105
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:17,189
Married into the richest copper claim
in this territory.

106
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:18,958
Then she must be Doretta Gateway.

107
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:23,496
Yep. She was scheduled to be an old maid
till Willard come along.

108
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:28,134
She's plain as adobe wall.
- But not too plain for Willard, huh?

109
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,237
Nothing plain about
old man Gateway's holdings.

110
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:35,975
Folks say that he's worth just the other
side of one half-million dollars.

111
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,211
That's too much money, Ed.
Too much for one man to worry about.

112
00:09:39,311 --> 00:09:43,839
It ain't for Willard.
He's a bookkeeper. Or he was.

113
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,186
They all say he'll probably make him
a full partner with the old man

114
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:52,024
since he took Doretta off his hands.
- You know, she didn't look so bad to me.

115
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:56,262
You've been down on the Sasabe Creek
too long, Patrick.

116
00:09:56,362 --> 00:10:01,292
That man made me so mad,
I almost forgot where I was going.

117
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,636
Come on and let me buy that drink for you.

118
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,938
Some other time, Ed. I gotta see Tenvoorde.

119
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,038
Well, suit yourself.

120
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:14,003
Mighty sweet of you to take him a present.
- See you!

121
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,300
Come on, get ahold of him!
Get both those ropes.

122
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Just grab him.

123
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,110
I couldn't have done that better myself.

124
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:58,475
Oh, you dropped your candy.

125
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,985
Thought that hitch post would hold him.

126
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:02,288
Well, now that explains it, don't it?

127
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,357
He wouldn't
know about horses, Mr. Tenvoorde.

128
00:12:05,457 --> 00:12:08,294
They say he's got mostly goats
at his new place.

129
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,453
Now, I didn't know that.

130
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,799
They're holding them
a goat-roping at Gotebo next month.

131
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,801
You should ought to enter.

132
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,703
That your new ramrod?
- Yep!

133
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,803
All mouth, ain't he?

134
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,976
Jace is just filling in till my old top hand
comes back.

135
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,845
You figure he will?
- Oh, I think so.

136
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,747
Soon as he gets shed of
some of them fancy ideas he's got

137
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:32,117
about owning his own place.
- Seems we've been over these words before.

138
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:35,588
And we're going to keep right on going
over them till you come to your senses.

139
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:40,526
It just ain't right, the best ramrod in this
territory throwing hisself away like you are.

140
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,596
Nobody can take hold of a ranch
the way you can, Pat.

141
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:47,700
A man can turn his back
when you're around. Now, just look at me.

142
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,969
Working my own stock
like a common trail hand

143
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,672
just because I can't trust the job done.
- Try firing a few. That'll do it.

144
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:56,675
You can start with that
goat lover over there.

145
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:59,945
Mr. Tenvoorde,
I come to buy me a seed bull.

146
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,681
You did, huh?
Well, now, what did I tell you?

147
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:06,719
Just hand over your money and you get
your bull. And it just ain't right.

148
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:10,122
Now, if you had to strain to get it, it'd be
a whole lot different. Don't you see?

149
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,491
All I can see is I got stock to tend.

150
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:16,228
If you don't want to sell me no seed bull,
just say it out in words.

151
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,197
Well?
- Tell you what I'll do, Patrick.

152
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,900
I'll give you a chance to get your bull free.

153
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,302
Like the time you gave me a chance
to get them yearlings free,

154
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,638
and ended up with 50 of my dollars?

155
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,940
Well, I'm keeping that
in a safe place for you, Patrick.

156
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,970
It's yours when you make up your mind
to come back to work.

157
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,885
You think a lot of that
claybank of yours, don't you?

158
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:44,183
Enough.
- All right, I'll make you a wager.

159
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:47,159
A bull of your choice against your horse.

160
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,295
And all you gotta do is ride him.

161
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:53,305
Ride him? You mean the bull?
- To a standstill.

162
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,446
I ain't interested.
- You ain't able.

163
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:11,750
That's what you mean, don't you?
- Yeah, that's what he means.

164
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,020
The boys around here keep saying
as how you're really something.

165
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,921
Best top hand around.
You don't look on fire to me.

166
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:27,325
I'll float my stick with Mr. Tenvoorde
here. You've gone gentle, Brennan.

167
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,854
You say any bull of my choice?

168
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:05,637
How long you figure it will lay a man up
if that bull was to stomp him?

169
00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:09,341
That all depends.
- I figure two or three weeks.

170
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,210
Oh, I figured that.

171
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:16,365
That ought to be long enough to talk that
hard-head into coming back to work for me.

172
00:15:34,032 --> 00:15:36,032
Give me his tail.

173
00:15:39,404 --> 00:15:42,209
All right, boys, let me have him.

174
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,788
Be seeing you!

175
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,150
Rintoon!

176
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:29,668
You didn't have to run me near over.
- Well, I didn't see it was you.

177
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:32,371
What happened, Patrick?
- I lost my horse.

178
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:35,707
Kind of careless, ain't it?
- To Tenvoorde.

179
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,478
Well, that figures.
- Rintoon! We'll never get to Bisbee

180
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:46,378
if you insist on stopping to pass the time
of day with... With everybody we meet.

181
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:54,088
Patrick, I want you to meet Mr.
Willard Mims. He's a bookkeeper.

182
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,230
Hello, Willard.

183
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,968
Rintoon, you are through!
I swear this is your last run on this line.

184
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:06,338
You know, after 20 years
as a top muleskinner,

185
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:09,341
that company's gonna be
sorry to see me go.

186
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,810
You won't be so sure of yourself
when we get to Bisbee.

187
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,175
Swing your saddle up here, Patrick.

188
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,515
Rintoon, I said...

189
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,251
You said I'd be sorry when we get to Bisbee.

190
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:23,055
Now, just get back in there, Willard.
Throw her up here, Patrick.

191
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,875
May I remind you, this is not...

192
00:20:30,695 --> 00:20:34,132
This is not the regular passenger coach.
- Do you want me to walk to Sasabe?

193
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:37,669
It's only 15 miles.
- Well, that's your problem.

194
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,204
Now, take that saddle off...
- Willard!

195
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:43,214
Willard, we can't let
him walk all of that way.

196
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:48,240
Well, if you ride, you ride up on the boot.

197
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,645
Much obliged. Ma'am.

198
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,691
I wondered why the regular stage
would be almost an hour early.

199
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,394
I'm obliged to you, Ed.
- Well, thank Willard for that.

200
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:06,998
I'll be getting off at Sasabe station.
Hank'll lend me a horse.

201
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:08,900
What's so funny?
- I was just thinking.

202
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,230
First time I ever been on a honeymoon.

203
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:31,677
Much obliged for the lift, Ed.
- Anytime, Patrick.

204
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:38,120
Hey, Hank! Hank!
- Jeff!

205
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,031
Jeff!

206
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,225
The regular stage ain't due here for an hour.

207
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,701
There ought to be somebody here.

208
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,807
Hey, Hank!

209
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,412
Rintoon, is there anything wrong?

210
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:03,748
Nothing we can't handle without you,
Willard.

211
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:06,510
Jeff!
- Hey, Hank!

212
00:23:07,752 --> 00:23:11,152
You all drop your guns and come on down.

213
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:20,561
Gentle now! Slow!

214
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:35,447
You folks in the coach,
let me see your hands, please.

215
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,880
Put them out there!

216
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:49,581
Driver, if you got anything down that
boot, you'd best hand-haul it out here.

217
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:54,598
I ain't got nothing you'd want,

218
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:01,337
but if you say so.

219
00:24:24,195 --> 00:24:27,425
I swear you hit him in mid-air, Chink!

220
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:35,307
I was waiting for that old man
to try something.

221
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,809
You didn't have to kill him.
- I would have sooner or later.

222
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,545
Funny thing about Chink there,
he keeps trying to prove he can shoot

223
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,715
better than any man alive. And he can.

224
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,908
Frank, candy!

225
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,222
You know, his pulling that saw-gun
just saved us some time.

226
00:24:51,322 --> 00:24:53,592
Billy Jack, you shut your mouth.
Get them out of there.

227
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:56,667
Chink, look up on top of the coach.

228
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:15,014
Ain't nothing up here but some old leather.
- How about the boot?

229
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:19,186
Ain't nothing here either, Frank.

230
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:26,724
The mail. Where is it?
- I wouldn't know.

231
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:30,128
Mister, you tell me!
- You made a mistake.

232
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:33,298
This isn't the regular stage.
It's not due for an hour.

233
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:37,435
The stage you want is due here at 5:00.
This is one I hired in Contention.

234
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:40,205
Mrs. Mims and I, we...
We're on our honeymoon.

235
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:43,195
We were just married this morning.

236
00:25:45,276 --> 00:25:47,574
Just this morning?

237
00:25:50,648 --> 00:25:52,884
Is that right?
- Of course it is!

238
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:57,188
Go in and check the schedule. You'll see.
- I'm asking this man. Well?

239
00:25:57,288 --> 00:25:59,057
I wouldn't know.

240
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:01,026
He don't know nothing.

241
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:03,628
How come you riding shotgun
for a pair of new-weds?

242
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:08,533
I wasn't. I got a place up on the Sasabe.
- Mister, is that true?

243
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:13,838
I suppose so. We picked him up
on the desert just outside of Contention.

244
00:26:13,938 --> 00:26:15,507
That's true.

245
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:19,602
Billy Jack, go in and check that schedule.
- Yo!

246
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:26,712
Billy! Hey, lady, come over here.

247
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:37,857
Can you cook? Well, can you?
- Yes.

248
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:42,094
Billy Jack, take her inside with you.
I could eat.

249
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:51,643
He'll find the schedule.
Like I said, it's due at 5:00.

250
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:55,747
I can see how you made a mistake,
thinking we were the regular stage.

251
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:58,142
We're on our way to Bisbee.

252
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:02,320
5:00 sharp, that regular passenger mail run
will be pulling in here.

253
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,754
Yes, sir.
- He's a talker.

254
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,327
What did you do with Hank?

255
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:14,297
Who's he?
- The station man here.

256
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:16,830
He's over yonder in the well.

257
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:25,738
And the boy?
- He's with him.

258
00:27:32,383 --> 00:27:35,086
Frank! 5:00, just like the fellow said.

259
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:39,624
See! Look, you let us go and
we'll never breathe a word about this.

260
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,724
Ain't he something?

261
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:44,462
I swear, we won't tell a thing.

262
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,562
I know you won't.

263
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:49,801
You go along with what he said about
what's happened here?

264
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,337
If I said yes, you wouldn't believe me.

265
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:56,432
Yeah, it's dumb even talking about it,
ain't it?

266
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:04,749
You know what's going to happen to you?
- I think so.

267
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,317
Are you scared?
- Yeah.

268
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,522
Well, you're honest about it,
I'll say that for you.

269
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:14,422
That well's going to be chock-full.

270
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,999
Wait a minute.
What are you listening to him for?

271
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,268
I told you, we won't say a word about this.

272
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,237
If you don't trust him, keep him here.
I don't know this man.

273
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,573
I'm not speaking for him anyway.

274
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,942
I'd be inclined to trust him
before I would you.

275
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:35,213
Hey, talker. Why don't you start running for
the well and see if you can make it?

276
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,415
Man, be reasonable!
- Look, you're not leaving here

277
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:39,617
and you're not going to be standing here
when that stage pulls in.

278
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:41,953
Now you can yell and carry on,
but that's the way it is.

279
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,223
What about my wife?
- Well, I can't help her being a woman.

280
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:48,724
All right, Chink.
- No, no, wait!

281
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:51,193
No, you can't do this!

282
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:56,787
I'll give you anything you want,
anything at all, only... My wife!

283
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,738
Do you know who she is?
- No, who?

284
00:29:00,838 --> 00:29:03,341
She's old man Gateway's daughter.
- So?

285
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:07,078
So, he just owns the richest copper mine
in the territory.

286
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,680
Well, don't you see?

287
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:12,116
You've got the daughter of a millionaire.
His only daughter!

288
00:29:12,216 --> 00:29:13,852
What do you suppose
he'd pay to get her back?

289
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:17,182
I don't know, what?
- Anything you ask.

290
00:29:18,222 --> 00:29:21,492
Look, here you sit
waiting for a two-bit holdup

291
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:24,729
and you've got a gold mine
right in your hands.

292
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:29,234
How do I know she's his daughter?
- You must have talked to the driver.

293
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,334
Didn't he tell you?

294
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,830
Well?
- He told me.

295
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,374
You wouldn't be lying
to stay out of the well, would you?

296
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:40,178
Of course he's not. Look,
it's only 20 miles back to Contention.

297
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,181
I could take a note to Mr. Gateway and...
- And we'd never see you again.

298
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,818
Would I save my own skin
and leave my wife here?

299
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:48,918
I think you would.

300
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:56,185
Well,
then there's no use even talking about it.

301
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:07,626
You and you, over there
and sit on that bench.

302
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:38,901
Billy.

303
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:47,143
Pick up the guns.

304
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,290
Get the horses.

305
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,630
Mister!

306
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,638
Put old man Gateway's name on that,
and where to find him.

307
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:17,375
Lf I give it to him myself...
- You're not going to give it to him yourself.

308
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:20,244
You're going to stop on the main road
to Contention, one mile this side,

309
00:31:20,344 --> 00:31:22,213
and you're going to give that note to
somebody passing in.

310
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:24,082
It tells old man Gateway that
you've got something important

311
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,683
to tell him about his daughter.

312
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:28,586
He's to come alone.
When he gets there, you tell him the story.

313
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,989
If he says no,
he doesn't see his daughter again.

314
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:34,125
If he says yes, he's to bring 50,000
in U.S. Scrip

315
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,593
to a place up back on the Sasabe.

316
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,693
And he comes alone.

317
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:42,133
Lf he doesn't have that much cash on hand?
- That's his problem.

318
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,502
Why can't I go right to him and tell him?

319
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:46,504
Billy Jack's going along to bring you back,

320
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:50,854
and I don't want him any place
he can get cornered.

321
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:55,780
When Mr. Gateway comes out with the
money, then you'll let us go. Is that it?

322
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,880
Yeah, that's it.

323
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,217
Billy Jack!

324
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:04,614
When do we leave?
- Now.

325
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:13,231
Could I say goodbye to my wife?
She's going to worry about me.

326
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,541
We'll say goodbye for you.

327
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:49,500
That boy puts his wife on a stake
and then wants to kiss her goodbye.

328
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,768
You figure me that one.

329
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:54,072
What I can't figure
is why you only asked for 50,000.

330
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:58,443
I'm not greedy.
- We don't have a need for this one, Frank.

331
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,611
You unhitch two of them mules.
I'll worry about him.

332
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:02,213
We might as well do it now as later.

333
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,082
We're taking him with us.
- What for?

334
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:06,117
'Cause I say so.
That be good enough reason?

335
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:10,354
Come on, Frank. We could run him down the
well and both take a bust at him. Come on!

336
00:33:10,454 --> 00:33:12,494
Just unhitch them mules.

337
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:25,837
I'd like to bury that man before we go.
- Put him in the well.

338
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:29,634
That ain't no fit place.
- What's your name?

339
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:32,910
Brennan.
- Well, Brennan, don't push your luck.

340
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,010
He goes in the well.

341
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:10,448
Lady, you're going to have to step up
on this mule just like your friend.

342
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,812
We've got no more horses.

343
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:55,684
Hold!

344
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,557
Chink, you put that man to chopping
some wood and then take care of the stock.

345
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:03,482
I'm going to find this lady
something to cook.

346
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,649
Hey, lady, come over here and sit down.

347
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:19,841
We can't build a fire without cutting wood.
Take it.

348
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:15,098
Lady, settle down someplace.

349
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:21,670
Ain't you going to eat? Well?

350
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,469
I'm not hungry.

351
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:28,034
You?
- Coffee's all.

352
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:30,876
Well, pour him some.

353
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:59,877
What have you done with my husband?

354
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:04,142
You know, you cook good.
A woman should cook good.

355
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:06,747
I have a right to know.

356
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:09,081
I suppose you do.

357
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:12,423
Chink, you tell this lady here
where her husband is.

358
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:17,368
Contention. Billy Jack took him there
to see your old man.

359
00:38:17,394 --> 00:38:18,863
My father?

360
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,133
Talk has it he owns the richest copper stake
in this territory.

361
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:27,171
Having you here kind of makes us partners.
- I don't understand.

362
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:31,606
Your daddy's gonna have to pay
to get you safe back.

363
00:38:33,143 --> 00:38:36,601
And if he doesn't?
- He'd better.

364
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:43,754
I ain't never shot me a woman before,
have I, Frank?

365
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:46,550
Chink, you shut up and eat.

366
00:38:48,325 --> 00:38:50,628
My husband is all right, then?

367
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,830
Billy Jack will fetch him here
in the morning.

368
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,899
I see.
- Do you?

369
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:05,898
Come dark,
you and him stay the night in there.

370
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:17,951
And me being either one of you,
I wouldn't come anywhere near that door.

371
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:21,555
That plain, Brennan?
- Yeah.

372
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:25,356
That's good. That's good.

373
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:44,210
Mr. Brennan.
- Yes, ma'am.

374
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:47,985
They must have known all the time about
our being on the way to Bisbee.

375
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:51,570
How else would they know
who my father is?

376
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:56,894
They were probably in Contention and
they heard my husband charter the coach.

377
00:39:56,994 --> 00:40:02,333
That's likely the way it was.
- Just wait till my father hears about this.

378
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,969
He'll have every man in the territory
out here.

379
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,279
I hope he doesn't do that.

380
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,340
He's not going to let
these men get away with this.

381
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,115
He's got no choice.
If they form men to ride this way...

382
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:20,494
Well, they've killed
and they'll kill again if they have to.

383
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:28,342
I'm sorry you getting involved in this.
- It hadn't been my day.

384
00:40:31,795 --> 00:40:34,098
You have a place near here, haven't you?

385
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:36,408
Yes, ma'am. On the Sasabe.

386
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:40,853
They'll be worried about you, won't they?

387
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:44,703
At my place? No, ma'am. I'm alone.

388
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:54,958
Mrs. Mims,
you'd better try and got some sleep.

389
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,526
Mr. Brennan.
- Yes, ma'am.

390
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:18,337
My husband, he was rude to you.
I'm sure he didn't mean to be.

391
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:21,776
Good night.
- Good night.

392
00:42:15,265 --> 00:42:17,265
Go have a look.

393
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:35,733
Pour yourself a cup of coffee.

394
00:42:47,664 --> 00:42:50,724
Have a seat. Over there.

395
00:42:59,676 --> 00:43:02,112
That wasn't a head I seen poking out that
door last night, was it?

396
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:04,181
Lf it was, why didn't you shoot at it?
- I about did.

397
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:08,479
Lucky thing it disappeared, whatever it was.

398
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:11,697
The lady, is she still asleep?
- Yeah.

399
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:13,989
Too bad about her.

400
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:17,928
Guess she's one of the plainest females
I ever seen. Her hair, the way it is.

401
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:21,498
And she could do something about her
clothes to let you know she's a woman.

402
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:24,034
It's no wonder she come off with
a low-grade husband like she did.

403
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,870
He ain't much.
- You got a wife up on your place, Brennan?

404
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:28,505
No.

405
00:43:28,605 --> 00:43:31,575
You should have.
Ain't right for a man to be alone.

406
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:36,044
They say that.
- Well, I ought to know.

407
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:39,707
Billy Jack and Chink, I don't like them.

408
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:45,422
Sometimes I get the feeling
they ain't even along.

409
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:49,727
Always talking the same words.
Women, drinking and the such.

410
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:53,864
I ain't narrow-thinking,
but a man gets tired of that all the time.

411
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,599
A man gets awful tired of that.

412
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,436
You cook good coffee.
- Brennan.

413
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,040
Talk.

414
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:09,811
What about?
- Your place. What's it like?

415
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:14,351
It's not much. Not yet, anyway.
- You got stock on it?

416
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:16,578
Some.
- Work the ground?

417
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:20,355
I plan to. Yeah.

418
00:44:23,493 --> 00:44:29,066
I'm gonna have me a place someday. I've
thought about it. I've thought about it a lot.

419
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:35,796
A man should have something of his own,
something to belong to. To be proud of.

420
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:42,690
You figure you'll get it this way?
- Sometimes you don't have a choice.

421
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:45,443
Don't you?

422
00:44:45,515 --> 00:44:47,895
Now look, Brennan...
- Frank!

423
00:44:52,155 --> 00:44:54,155
Here they come.

424
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:22,163
Grab the horses, Billy Jack.

425
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,423
Well, it's all set.
- What did he say?

426
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:27,658
He said he'd bring out the money.

427
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:30,360
Is that right, Billy Jack?
Did he say he'd bring out the money?

428
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,929
That's what he said.

429
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:35,174
You expect any funny business?
- Nope!

430
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,168
He can scare up that much money, can he?

431
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:40,671
He said he could, but it'd
take him most of the day to do it.

432
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:43,907
Means he'd be out sometime tomorrow.
- That's right.

433
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,142
You give him the directions, Billy?

434
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,945
Like you said, right at the mouth of
<i>the barranco chock-full of willow.</i>

435
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:52,950
Do you think he can find it?
- I made him say it twice every turn.

436
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:56,253
How'd he take it?
- How do you think he took it?

437
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:58,353
Mister, I'm asking you.

438
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:02,659
Well, of course he was mad. But there
wasn't anything he could do about it.

439
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:08,265
He's a reasonable man. I think you
made yourself a pretty good deal.

440
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:12,785
Yeah. Now do you want to stay out here
or go back in?

441
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:16,371
What?

442
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:18,974
You don't hear so good.

443
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:22,880
You mean, you'd let me go?

444
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,995
Mister, we don't need you anymore.
Billy, get him his horse.

445
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:34,124
I could go back now and lead
old man Gateway back here in the morning.

446
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:38,251
Sure you could.
- My wife, she's all right?

447
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:40,328
Still asleep.

448
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:43,033
Listen, you know
I'd rather stay here with her,

449
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,602
but if it means getting
old man Gateway out here faster,

450
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:47,638
then I think I'd better go.
- I know what you mean.

451
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:50,340
Don't you want to see your wife?
- Well,

452
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,376
the quicker I get traveling, the better.

453
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,476
She'll understand.

454
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,716
We'll see you tomorrow then?
- About the same time.

455
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,816
Yeah.

456
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:07,747
All right to get going?
- Sure.

457
00:47:08,925 --> 00:47:11,826
Now?
- Sure.

458
00:47:34,951 --> 00:47:36,951
Bust him, Chink.

459
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,070
Get rid of him, Billy.

460
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,917
What do you suppose
is the matter with her?

461
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:10,821
Hey, lady, don't you realize
what you just got out of?

462
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:16,757
She didn't know he did it.
- No, I don't guess she would, at that.

463
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,762
Lady, don't you know
that boy was selling you?

464
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:21,865
This whole thing was his idea
to save his own skin.

465
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:23,967
He was ready to leave you again just now.

466
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:27,971
Then I got awful sick of him,
way down deep inside.

467
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:31,675
That was some boy you was married to
who would do a thing like that.

468
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,410
Look, what he did was wrong,

469
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:37,814
but you going along with it,
then shooting him down, that was all right?

470
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:43,609
If you can't see the difference,
I ain't going to explain it to you.

471
00:48:48,391 --> 00:48:49,993
How many does that make?

472
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:54,431
He was the seventh.
- When do you figure on eight and nine?

473
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:57,367
Tomorrow before we leave,
you can count on it.

474
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:00,971
Lf your boss gives the word.
- Don't worry about that.

475
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,874
I figure I can count on mine in the back.

476
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:06,510
You can count on getting yours in the front.

477
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,879
I'd kind of like to watch your face.

478
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:12,783
But you can make a run for it right now
if you'd like to make it interesting.

479
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:16,086
Better than just standing there
and getting it.

480
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:19,586
I'll wait till tomorrow.
- Suit yourself.

481
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:39,843
I... I'm sorry, Mrs. Mims.
- Why didn't you tell me?

482
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:45,298
Why didn't you tell me that he was...
- It wouldn't have helped.

483
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:50,153
He could have been doing it for all of us.

484
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:52,787
Yes, ma'am.

485
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:04,706
But you don't believe that, do you?
- You knew your husband better than I did.

486
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:10,073
Terrible things have happened
these past two days,

487
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:14,132
yet all I can do is think of myself.

488
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:20,650
All I can do is look at myself and feel very
foolish! And do you know why?

489
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:23,086
Because I know now
that he never cared for me!

490
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:26,671
That he married me for his own interests!

491
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:35,995
I saw him killed just now and I
couldn't even feel sorry for him.

492
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:39,035
All I could do was think that he didn't
love me! That he didn't care...

493
00:50:39,135 --> 00:50:42,070
Now you listen to me, Mrs. Mims.

494
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:44,841
Your husband married you for your money.
You know it and I know it.

495
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:47,544
But you're alive and he's dead
and that makes the difference.

496
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:50,347
You can cry and moon about being
a fool until they shoot you tomorrow,

497
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:55,085
or you can start thinking about saving
your skin. But I'll tell you this.

498
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:59,256
It'll take both of us
working together to stay alive.

499
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:02,726
They said they'd let us go.
- You think they'd do that?

500
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:05,095
They've killed four people
in less than two days.

501
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:07,797
And the only reason they've kept me around
this long is because they thought

502
00:51:07,897 --> 00:51:12,969
they might've needed me in case something
went wrong in Contention.

503
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:19,274
No, Mrs. Mims, we've got until your father
gets here tomorrow, that's all.

504
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:23,731
I don't care what happens to me.

505
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:29,719
Well, I care about me.

506
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:34,157
I'm not going to be shot in the belly
because you feel sorry for yourself.

507
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:39,229
They're going to kill us, Mrs. Mims.
Think about that for a while.

508
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:42,304
Well, what can I do?
- I don't know.

509
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:47,804
We've got to keep our eyes open,
watch every move they make.

510
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:51,899
And when our chance comes,
we've got to take it.

511
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:00,348
I'm scared.

512
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:03,918
So am I.

513
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:19,836
Hey, that's a big buck, Chink.

514
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:23,006
He was in a full run, I hit him smack
in the middle, near tore him in two.

515
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:26,876
Billy Jack, you get Brennan to dress down
enough for supper. You do the cooking.

516
00:52:26,976 --> 00:52:28,345
That's woman's work!

517
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:30,513
I said you'll do the cooking,
I'm not going to have burnt meat

518
00:52:30,613 --> 00:52:34,523
'cause that lady's
in a state over her husband.

519
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,889
You want I should take a plate in
to the woman, Frank?

520
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:14,989
Eat.

521
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:18,595
You'd never know she was around,
would you? Quiet like she is.

522
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,431
Them's the kind you gotta watch, Billy.

523
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:26,935
I had me a quiet woman once.
Outside she was as calm as Sunday,

524
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:31,235
but inside, wild as mountain scenery.

525
00:53:31,307 --> 00:53:34,537
Gotta ride out that way again one day.

526
00:53:34,677 --> 00:53:37,874
Where's that, Chink?
- Sonora Town.

527
00:53:37,947 --> 00:53:40,347
Hey, I was there once.

528
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:45,252
Once? You mean you've never been back?

529
00:53:45,321 --> 00:53:47,380
What for?

530
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:55,058
How old are you, Billy?
- I don't know. Young mostly. Why?

531
00:53:55,131 --> 00:54:01,761
Just happens there's over 10 head of
female to every man in Sonora. That's why!

532
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:06,967
Who said?
- I said. Ought to know.

533
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:09,813
I guess I romanced over half of them.

534
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:13,993
Been there yet,
if I haven't pulled a leg muscle.

535
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:20,657
I was bucking horses across the line
and selling 'em tame up in Bisbee.

536
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:23,159
You never told me that, Chink.

537
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:29,165
You never asked me. Course a good amount
of 'em are nothing but hurrah gals.

538
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:33,005
But the way I look at it, a woman's a woman.

539
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,810
Ain't that right, Frank?

540
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:41,074
Lf you say so.
- See?

541
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:51,117
Hey, Chink, when that fellow gets here
with the money,

542
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:54,824
what say we both swing down that way,
toward Sonora.

543
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:59,295
I swear you're getting older all the time,
Billy. Ain't he, Frank?

544
00:54:59,395 --> 00:55:01,920
Yeah. All the time.

545
00:56:19,475 --> 00:56:21,855
You're quite a hand at that.

546
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:27,116
Suppose you're wondering
how come we keep you around.

547
00:56:27,216 --> 00:56:31,619
Am I?
- Plain face truth is I like you, Brennan.

548
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:36,059
There ain't many men I can say that about.
- Many say it about you?

549
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:38,495
There was then when they did.

550
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:42,866
Yeah, time was I was looked on with
a fair amount of respect where I come from.

551
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:44,991
Where's that?
- Wyoming.

552
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,769
You're a long way from home.

553
00:56:46,869 --> 00:56:52,642
I have to be. Why there's them would see me
hang if I was to ride there again.

554
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,978
Strange, the law wanting to do me that way.

555
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:58,414
Me, I never tripped a hammer
on a man in my life.

556
00:56:58,514 --> 00:57:03,954
I leave that to young guns like them two
over there. Look at 'em.

557
00:57:04,787 --> 00:57:09,125
Billy Jack, no folks, no schooling.
Been fighting and cheating his way

558
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:14,030
since he was first able to walk. And Chink,
the same. Shot his first man dead

559
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,758
when he was 12. His old man.

560
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:19,836
Caught him beating his mother
with a broken tequila bottle.

561
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,427
Nothing but animals.

562
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:25,398
You run with them.

563
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:31,275
Well, I can't help the way they are.
Nobody can help their kind.

564
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:33,606
Nobody tries.

565
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:39,822
Well, I sure don't know
why I like you, Brennan.

566
00:57:39,922 --> 00:57:43,059
You talk back, you act proud
when you should be bowing down.

567
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:47,289
I sure don't know why.
But I'll tell you this.

568
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:50,300
Your hill's gonna get higher to climb
come tomorrow morning.

569
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,237
When that money gets here, Billy Jack and
Chink'll be all for killing you and the lady.

570
00:57:54,337 --> 00:58:00,207
And you?
- Like you say, I run with 'em.

571
00:58:35,344 --> 00:58:37,344
Mr. Brennan.

572
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:43,086
I'm sorry for the way I acted this morning.
I hoped you'd understand.

573
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,488
Maybe I do, better than you think.

574
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:49,926
But right now, you need a way to stay
alive more than you need sympathy.

575
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,406
I can't help the way I feel.

576
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:55,830
Did you love him?

577
00:58:57,366 --> 00:58:59,902
Married him.
- That's not what I asked.

578
00:59:00,002 --> 00:59:04,200
Did you love him?
- Yes. Yes, I did.

579
00:59:04,273 --> 00:59:06,142
Mrs. Mims, you're a liar. You didn't love him

580
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:12,362
and you never for one minute thought
he loved you. That's true, isn't it?

581
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,951
Do you know what it's like to be alone

582
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:20,590
in a camp full of rough-neck miners,
a father who holds a quiet hatred for you

583
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:23,626
because you're not the son
he's always wanted?

584
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:30,393
Yes, I married Willard Mims because
I couldn't stand being alone anymore.

585
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:35,267
I knew all the time he didn't love me.
But I didn't care.

586
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:41,744
I thought I'd make him love me. And
by the time that he asked me to marry him,

587
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:46,916
I'd lied to myself inside for so long
that I believed it was me he cared for

588
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:49,016
and not the money.

589
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:52,486
Now this.

590
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,728
So, what have you lost,
outside of a little pride?

591
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:02,031
Afraid you can't get another man, is
that it? Afraid what people might say?

592
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:04,734
Even if Willard did marry you
for your money, at least he married you.

593
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:11,804
He was your first and last chance as far as
you were concerned, so you grabbed him.

594
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:21,551
You think nobody'll have you because you
bite your lip and hang your head.

595
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:24,020
But let me tell you something.

596
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,056
You're as much woman as any of 'em.
A lot more than most.

597
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:29,225
But you got to realize,
if you don't think anything of yourself,

598
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:30,526
how do you expect anybody else to?

599
01:00:30,626 --> 01:00:32,795
I can't help how I feel.
- Lf you can't, who can?

600
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:35,431
You can't always sit back
and wait for something to happen.

601
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:42,061
Sometimes you got to walk
up and take what you want.

602
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:09,065
I'll be back and when I get back,
you two be ready to leave.

603
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:12,668
Frank, you're sure you don't want
I should go along?

604
01:01:12,768 --> 01:01:14,303
I'm sure.

605
01:01:14,403 --> 01:01:17,373
Fifty thousand. That's a lot of dollars.

606
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:19,876
You might need some help getting back
here again.

607
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:21,976
I said I'm sure.

608
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:42,286
What do you want?
- Water.

609
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,365
Well, get it.

610
01:01:46,702 --> 01:01:49,105
Brennan, from now on when you walk,
you walk noisy

611
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:52,275
or you're going to get your head
blowed off before you figured.

612
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,375
Thanks.

613
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:06,556
You boys are going to like it in Mexico.

614
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:10,426
Then again, of course,
he just might swing north.

615
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:14,011
Hard to find a man in that piney country.

616
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:21,510
What'd you mean by that remark
you just passed?

617
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:25,302
Frank was talking to you.

618
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:30,479
Did he say anything would make you
pass a remark like that? Well, did he?

619
01:02:30,579 --> 01:02:35,084
What do you think?
- I think you're just saying words.

620
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:39,112
Then you got nothing to worry about.

621
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:48,829
What is it?

622
01:03:10,519 --> 01:03:12,612
Billy Jack!
- Yeah.

623
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:14,688
Keep an eye on 'em.

624
01:03:15,257 --> 01:03:19,395
Where are you going, Chink?
- I'm gonna circle high around

625
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:24,425
and make sure Frank don't
ride away rich and leave us poor!

626
01:03:42,918 --> 01:03:46,081
Chink and Usher have gone.
- Gone?

627
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:59,629
Now. It's now or...

628
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:01,237
Unbutton your dress.
- What?

629
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,839
Just do like I tell you!
Billy Jack will come in here.

630
01:04:03,939 --> 01:04:06,909
Act surprised, embarrassed.
Then smile at him.

631
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:11,939
Once he comes through this door,
don't let him turn around.

632
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:36,003
Coffee?

633
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:42,323
What's the matter with it? You make it?

634
01:05:06,001 --> 01:05:09,146
Ain't you gonna look in on the woman?

635
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:11,640
What do you mean?

636
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:15,905
You can't be so young
I have to draw you pictures.

637
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:34,538
Have they been seeing her?

638
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:40,291
They went in there yesterday morning
while you were gone.

639
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:02,583
Don't look at him.

640
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,460
Come on!

641
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:25,205
In! Quick!

642
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:28,410
Stay here, I'll get you a horse.

643
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:31,547
See that lone peak? Ride right at it.
You'll hit the Sasabe.

644
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:35,417
When you do, swing south. It follows on
into my place. You'll be safe there.

645
01:07:35,517 --> 01:07:38,154
Well, what about you?
- I'm going to finish this.

646
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:40,689
They come,
I'm going to finish this once and for all!

647
01:07:40,789 --> 01:07:42,858
But why?
- Some things a man can't ride around!

648
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:44,958
I'm staying with you.

649
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:47,930
For two days you've been telling me
what to do and what not to do.

650
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:51,193
Not anymore. If you stay, I stay.

651
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,239
Back, get back!

652
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,776
Billy Jack?

653
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:39,179
Billy Jack!

654
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:44,818
Well, take it.

655
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:55,760
Chink! Chink!

656
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:57,831
Chink, come on out!

657
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:01,270
I'm going around those rocks.

658
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:02,905
When I get even with Chink's horse,

659
01:09:03,005 --> 01:09:08,445
let go at the door and don't stop shooting
until the gun's empty.

660
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,544
Chink!

661
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,677
Billy Jack!

662
01:12:35,183 --> 01:12:37,183
Chink!

663
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,679
Hold it!

664
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:47,137
You been busy, ain't you?
- Drop your gun!

665
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:52,051
Now your saddle bags!

666
01:13:54,663 --> 01:13:56,663
Fifty thousand!

667
01:13:56,732 --> 01:14:01,470
Shame having to give that clear up!
- What have you done with my father?

668
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:05,641
Sent him on back to Contention, lady.
Told him you'd be along.

669
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:08,801
Too bad about them in there.
- Is it?

670
01:14:09,911 --> 01:14:11,911
Turn around, Usher.

671
01:14:11,913 --> 01:14:14,783
Did that, I wouldn't be able
to ride out of here peaceful.

672
01:14:14,883 --> 01:14:17,419
That's what I full intend to do.

673
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:21,356
I'm gonna walk over there to my animal
and ride on out like I never even been here.

674
01:14:21,456 --> 01:14:26,519
I wouldn't try it.
- You won't do me with that scatter gun.

675
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:30,861
Not in the back. I kept you alive, Brennan.

676
01:14:30,932 --> 01:14:36,038
Wasn't for me, you'd be in that well back
at that swing station. Remember?

677
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:40,199
I remember.
- I figured you would.

678
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:44,268
I'm gonna start walking.
- Don't do it, Frank.

679
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:13,066
So long, Brennan. Lady.

680
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:22,709
Brennan!

681
01:16:36,525 --> 01:16:40,791
Now you just stop that. It's all over.

682
01:16:42,464 --> 01:16:48,669
We'll have to ride back to Contention.
They'll want to know what happened.

683
01:16:58,046 --> 01:17:01,361
Come on, now. It's gonna be a nice day.
