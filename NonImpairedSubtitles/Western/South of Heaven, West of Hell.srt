1
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:55,348
<i>Proverbs,</i>
chapter 18, verses 1-24.

2
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:58,150
Through desire, a man,
having separated himself,

3
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,999
seeketh and intermeddleth
with all wisdom.

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,187
Seeketh and intermeddleth
with all wisdom.

5
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:04,123
A man hath no delight
in understanding

6
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,392
but that his heart
may discover itself.

7
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:08,561
These iniquities
called moving pictures

8
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,730
are nothing more than
one of Satan's tools

9
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,765
for blinding the eyes
of the poor lost souls

10
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,400
who would look upon such images.

11
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:17,003
It is not unlike lot's wife

12
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:18,471
who was tempted by Lucifer

13
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,007
and drawn to look back
upon sodom and gomorrah.

14
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,142
These sad, stray lambs, too,

15
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,411
as shall most
of the sons and daughters

16
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,346
of this once God-fearing nation

17
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,999
be turned to pillars of salt
and lost in eternal fires.

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,518
Be turned to pillars of salt
and lost in eternal fires.

19
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,987
Take refuge
in this, his holy word,

20
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,157
while there is still time.

21
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,163
How long will your marshal

22
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,233
allow this flickering den of sin
to rob the poor wandering sheep

23
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,703
in this plague-ridden little
Hamlet of their clear sight?

24
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:58,177
These are the things I've
been telling you of, my people,

25
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,311
these iniquities.

26
00:02:59,312 --> 00:02:59,999
This is what happens
when you do not

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,347
this is what happens
when you do not

28
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,450
follow the word of our lord.

29
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,000
Stupid idiot...

30
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:01,208
Stupid idiot...

31
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,612
...Scared everybody
half to death.

32
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,118
Take refuge in that.

33
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,089
I'm going' to Texas.
Ain't no good.

34
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,062
What's going on in there?

35
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:39,378
You're goin' to jail.

36
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,114
You earned yourself
a trip to jail.

37
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,517
He broke my movin'
picture box, clete.

38
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:45,518
You gonna make him pay for it?

39
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,387
Come on. It cost me $50.00.

40
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,257
He broke it!

41
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:55,594
I ain't even had it a month.

42
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,396
If he ain't got no money,
I want his boots.

43
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,398
Can I have his gun belt,
or his gun?

44
00:04:59,399 --> 00:04:59,999
And I want the cartridges
in it, too.

45
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,200
And I want the cartridges
in it, too.

46
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:04,103
And his coat.
Whatever he's wearing.

47
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,571
He's gonna pay for my box.

48
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,573
You gonna pay for it, ain't ye?

49
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:09,408
Huh? Well, ain't ye?

50
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,978
You gonna pay for it!

51
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,557
I'll take
his hat and his coat...

52
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:26,025
Go on.

53
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:27,693
...and everything he's got.

54
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,563
You know where you goin'.

55
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,764
Go on.

56
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,032
Hold on a minute.

57
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,600
Excuse us, marshal.

58
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:35,601
There you go.

59
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,169
He's goin' to the back.

60
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,038
Are you gonna make him

61
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,106
pay for my movin' picture box?

62
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,575
That thing
was brand new, almost,

63
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,143
and it cost me a lot of money

64
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,246
and I want it paid for.

65
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,583
Eli, you want a cup of coffee?

66
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,623
Clete, would you
get Eli a cup of coffee?

67
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,999
I surely will.

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,560
I surely will.

69
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,469
Marshal...

70
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,604
Is there any likely

71
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,240
I could leave early today?

72
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,376
Well, yeah, clete, that's OK.

73
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,645
Surely appreciate it.

74
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,514
Sure gotta
get my wife a present.

75
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:29,999
Surely do.

76
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,450
Surely do.

77
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:32,184
I ain't got so much thought

78
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,019
on what to get a woman.

79
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,655
Surely don't.

80
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:42,494
I don't know what you'd
get a woman either, clete.

81
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,663
I suspect they'd
want the one thing

82
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,398
you didn't get 'em.

83
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,102
Oh, I surely hope not.

84
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:55,407
I ain't so sure no more
why I married up to her.

85
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,543
I sure ain't.

86
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,999
I suspect it's nice
to have someone

87
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,046
I suspect it's nice
to have someone

88
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,981
to go home to at night,
isn't it, clete?

89
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,351
Well...

90
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:09,188
Yes, sir, that's right.
It surely is nice

91
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,323
to have someone to go home to.

92
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,725
That's why I done it, marshal.

93
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,260
Sure is.

94
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,402
Hello, clete.

95
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:24,503
I sure wish you
a merry Christmas,

96
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,437
miss Tess.

97
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,706
You have a merry Christmas, too.

98
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,708
And say merry Christmas
to heddie for me.

99
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:30,000
I will.

100
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:31,210
I will.

101
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,112
Yes, ma'am, I surely will.

102
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,180
Nice seeing you.

103
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,386
That's a lot of gifts.

104
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,087
Almost doesn't
leave you any room

105
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,455
to be a marshal, does it?

106
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,591
It doesn't really
take that much space

107
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:48,027
to be a marshal, Tess.

108
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,362
Um, that's lucky

109
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,331
that you don't need
much room to work

110
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,567
so you can have lots of gifts.

111
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,438
Isn't it kinda hard to breathe?

112
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,308
This one's got a lot
of perfume on it.

113
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,217
I'm not breathing very well.

114
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,021
Can you feel it?

115
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,461
Do you feel faint, Tess?

116
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,365
I mean, you look OK.

117
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,967
Well, looks
can fool you, marshal.

118
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:29,999
I think I do feel faint.

119
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,960
I think I do feel faint.

120
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,607
Is there anything
I can do, Tess?

121
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:38,977
If I could just
get some fresh air.

122
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,013
That perfume's bothering me.

123
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,214
Do you want me to open a door

124
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,116
or a window?

125
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,186
Yeah, that would help a little.

126
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,554
Well, I gotta help you

127
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:50,256
more than a little, Tess.

128
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,227
Hey, Tess?

129
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,764
Tess?

130
00:09:59,399 --> 00:09:59,999
Hey, Tess, maybe I better
go get the doctor.

131
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,720
Hey, Tess, maybe I better
go get the doctor.

132
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,606
Should I go get the doctor?

133
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,043
Hmm?

134
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:23,555
Hey!

135
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,656
Goddamn!

136
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,426
Just kissin'. Just kissin'.

137
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,999
I forgot about you
and your coffee, Eli.

138
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,560
I forgot about you
and your coffee, Eli.

139
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,634
You wanna go home?

140
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,553
Got a little piece of news

141
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,422
I believe is just
gonna tickle you.

142
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,162
Appears to be that the marshal

143
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,097
in this piss pit might just

144
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:07,300
be an old friend of yours.

145
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,253
Oh, I--I can come back later.

146
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,999
No. Come on in.

147
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,457
No. Come on in.

148
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,129
He loves pie.

149
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,166
Thank you, Jenny.

150
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,635
That's sweet.

151
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:48,007
Would you
like a piece of pie, Tess?

152
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,999
<i>Feliz</i> navidad, ma'am.

153
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,612
<i>Feliz</i> navidad, ma'am.

154
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,749
Good afternoon.

155
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,122
Reckon I better
go down and see Sandy.

156
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,359
Check on how bad that fella
shot up the livery.

157
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,231
How many pies does this make?

158
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,000
Well, that would've been 3.

159
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,237
Why don't you just
put your fingers

160
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,005
in the middle of it, Tess?

161
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,140
That'd be quicker
than working your way in

162
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,999
from the outside,
don't you reckon?

163
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,360
From the outside,
don't you reckon?

164
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,013
I'm not much of a cook.

165
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,694
Who said anything
about your cookin'?

166
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,164
You don't care if we
have dinner or not?

167
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,533
No.

168
00:13:59,238 --> 00:13:59,999
Marshal?

169
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,239
Marshal?

170
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,441
Yeah, what?

171
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:11,050
Good afternoon, marshal.

172
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,554
Hello, Taylor.

173
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,389
Good afternoon,

174
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,159
Mrs. Casey, is it?

175
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,463
This is Tess bonaventure.

176
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:25,997
She's a friend of mine.

177
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,733
Mmm.

178
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,999
You're a long way
from amarillo, Taylor.

179
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,502
You're a long way
from amarillo, Taylor.

180
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:31,570
Got ourselves a ranch

181
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:36,007
out across yonder,
in old Mexico.

182
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,110
It's real nice.

183
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,412
It is indeed
a pleasure to meet you,

184
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,314
miss bonaventure.

185
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:43,448
A pleasure.

186
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,716
This is Taylor Henry.

187
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,487
My family ranched
near Taylor's family.

188
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,323
Daddy wants you
to bring Valentine outside

189
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,024
so's they can talk.

190
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,227
Leland's here.

191
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,561
Arvid, you didn't even say hi

192
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,697
to your brother, here...

193
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,999
The marshal.

194
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,500
The marshal.

195
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:07,472
What's it been, val,
about 11 years?

196
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,307
A long time, Taylor.

197
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,676
Really?

198
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,213
Sure doesn't seem all
that long to me, val.

199
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,116
These are your brothers?

200
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,551
No.

201
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:22,120
I didn't mean to shame you, val,

202
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,723
by bringing up
old family ties and all.

203
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:27,459
You didn't shame me, Taylor.

204
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,261
We're not brothers.

205
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:29,999
No?

206
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,263
No?

207
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,998
Ok.

208
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:35,033
Not by blood, but--

209
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:38,437
You know, I figure daddy
raisin' you and all...

210
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,572
That ought to
count for something,

211
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,041
shouldn't it, val?

212
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,111
I guess, Taylor.

213
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,246
Between me and leland.

214
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,049
Let's go.

215
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,663
"And the lord sayeth,

216
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,667
<i>I and my father are one."</i>

217
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,139
"And the son sayeth unto him...

218
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:15,674
<i>"Father, I have
sinned against heaven,</i>

219
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,676
<i>"and in thy sight
I'm no longer worthy</i>

220
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:19,678
<i>to be called thy son."</i>

221
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,480
Valentine, come over here

222
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,548
and take my hand.

223
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,417
Sissy, mind yourself.

224
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,319
Leave Valentine alone.

225
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,720
Sissy!

226
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:29,999
You're lookin' well, boy.

227
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,389
You're lookin' well, boy.

228
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,225
We read about you
in the newspaper,

229
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,426
being wounded,

230
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:35,694
being in Cuba.

231
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,596
We were real proud
when we learned

232
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,132
you'd made lieutenant,
were we not, boys?

233
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,568
I bet you was real handsome

234
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,303
when you was shot.

235
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,406
Were we not, boys?!

236
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,447
Daddy was all tore up
about that, val.

237
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,316
What brings the Henrys
to Los tragos, leland?

238
00:16:58,317 --> 00:16:59,999
We have business up in tuscon.

239
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,160
We have business up in tuscon.

240
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,390
Never knew you to travel much

241
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,159
during the holidays.

242
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,063
I came through here
hoping to find a chemist.

243
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:16,168
We got one, but he's not here.

244
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,705
He's gone back east
till after the new year.

245
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:24,609
You still use the laudanum?

246
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,244
Yes.

247
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:29,999
It, like my chair, I remain
shackled to, Valentine.

248
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,483
It, like my chair, I remain
shackled to, Valentine.

249
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:34,185
I was hoping, uh,
you'd ride with us

250
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:36,454
just a little ways.
We could catch up a bit.

251
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,325
Well, you caught me
at a bad time, leland...

252
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:44,496
With Christmas tomorrow.

253
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,631
I'm disappointed.

254
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,500
I'd looked forward to talking.

255
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,535
Daddy, maybe I could
stay here with Valentine

256
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,003
and you could pick me up

257
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,204
on y'all's way back through.

258
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,374
We're not passing
through here again, sissy.

259
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,742
Now get up in the wagon.

260
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,744
Oh, let him have her.

261
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,000
The rest of us are
tired to damn death of her.

262
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:03,182
The rest of us are
tired to damn death of her.

263
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,399
We'll be leaving you
now, marshal.

264
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,168
Git!

265
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,504
I love you, Valentine.

266
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:24,030
Yah! Heh! Let's go! Let's go!

267
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,438
Val, val.

268
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,341
Drop it!

269
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,382
Hey, clete!

270
00:21:59,285 --> 00:21:59,999
Stop, clete, wait!

271
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,220
Stop, clete, wait!

272
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,523
Giddy up! Giddy up!

273
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,734
Stop!

274
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,036
Stop the wagon, sissy!

275
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,572
What the hell is wrong
with you, sissy?

276
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,207
Turn this wagon around

277
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,742
so I can see
that bastard's face.

278
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,711
Daddy, no,
please don't kill him.

279
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:00,000
Turn, turn, turn!

280
00:23:00,001 --> 00:23:02,280
Turn, turn, turn!

281
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:05,149
Val, you run! Run on, val, run!

282
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,217
Leland!

283
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,086
Don't make me shoot you, leland.

284
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:10,756
I swear to God I'll
shoot the living--

285
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,360
Heddie!

286
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:35,407
Out, then! Out, I said!

287
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,549
Hyah, hyah!

288
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:22,353
Nice doggy.

289
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,023
Nice doggy.

290
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:50,616
Don't be beatin' on
that goddamned door!

291
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,607
Come on in here, goddamn it!

292
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:25,016
<i>Vamonos,</i> pachuco!

293
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:26,117
<i>¡Andele, andele!</i>

294
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:28,152
Don't stand there
like a bug in his shit!

295
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,999
<i>¡Andele!</i>

296
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,500
<i>¡Andele!</i>

297
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:36,127
I'm agent otts,
from the war department.

298
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:39,430
I trust you received
a wire from judge combes.

299
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,531
Good.

300
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:43,234
I'm damn glad of it
that you're here.

301
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:45,103
When you quit chewing the cud

302
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,971
with that ass boil back there,

303
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:48,306
I'm gonna hang him.

304
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:50,608
I would have already hung him

305
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,376
if it hadn't have been
for that court cable.

306
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,246
I'd have hung him 2 weeks ago.

307
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:57,381
That lowdown cheat...

308
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,650
Killed my sister's man.

309
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:00,000
Now she's back livin'
with me and mine.

310
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:03,589
Now she's back livin'
with me and mine.

311
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,424
Well, the department
thanks you, sheriff,

312
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,627
for keeping
your emotions bridled.

313
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,564
Pardon me.

314
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,133
I need to speak...

315
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:18,069
To Mr. Sanchez...

316
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,538
Regarding a family
named Henry he rode with.

317
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,273
They robbed a bank.

318
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:24,342
They murdered several people

319
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:26,011
Christmas Eve last year.

320
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,212
What are you doing there?

321
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,413
What's that stink?

322
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:29,999
I'm sorry.

323
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,615
I'm sorry.

324
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:32,050
Oh, excuse me.

325
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:35,319
Clove oil.

326
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,388
A marvelous gentleman
on the train gave it to me.

327
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:40,391
Been experiencing some
difficulty with a tooth.

328
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,427
I do apologize.
It's rather pungent.

329
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:44,729
Actually, I've been receiving

330
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,032
a small measure
of relief from it.

331
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:50,234
Uh-huh.

332
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:51,703
I, uh--

333
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,039
I cabled Santa Fe, and...

334
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,575
When I made his capture,
he had not a nickel on him

335
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:59,999
except what he cheated
off my sister's man.

336
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,245
Except what he cheated
off my sister's man.

337
00:28:00,246 --> 00:28:02,413
I understand,
but it's not the money

338
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:03,481
that we're concerned with.

339
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:04,448
Good.

340
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,516
What I need

341
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,719
is the information
regarding marshal Casey.

342
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,691
Uh, it is of
the utmost importance.

343
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:19,597
When you get through
jawboning with him,

344
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:22,500
we're gonna have
to work on that rope.

345
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:25,971
I want to make him
hop and squeal.

346
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,140
Bills!

347
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:29,999
Huh, bills.

348
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,209
Huh, bills.

349
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,976
What?

350
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:35,314
Go back and open up
that bull turd's cell.

351
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,285
Have you got a gun?

352
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,055
No.

353
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:45,756
Well, yes.

354
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,358
I mean, I guess.

355
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,762
Actually, I have an issued
small caliber revolver,

356
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:54,232
but it's out in the trunk...

357
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,967
By the dog.

358
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:59,237
Uh, I--I believe it's unloaded,

359
00:28:59,238 --> 00:28:59,999
but if you like, I'll go and--

360
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,339
But if you like, I'll go and--

361
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,408
No, no, no! Hell, no.

362
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,980
Take that key...

363
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:12,416
And go out there and
wait by that cell door.

364
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,352
And don't be foolin'
with that lock.

365
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:16,520
Not until my man gets there

366
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,724
and holds a gun
on that pus weasel.

367
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:26,365
Thank you, sir.

368
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,275
Get on up!

369
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:40,278
There's a government man
here to talk to you.

370
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,647
You rot in hell.

371
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:45,651
Go on.

372
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,293
Hey, don't. I'm sorry?

373
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,494
Not there.

374
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:58,129
I beg your pardon. Ooh! Oh!

375
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,697
That's the shit hole.

376
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:00,000
Oh, my God!

377
00:30:00,001 --> 00:30:01,432
Oh, my God!

378
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:03,467
Hey, don't sling
that around, goddamn it!

379
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,436
I'll knock the fuck out of you!

380
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:07,472
Now, just stand the fuck still.

381
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:13,111
Now, what do you want?

382
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,516
Take that fucking rag
off your mouth.

383
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:21,118
I can't hear
a goddamn word you sayin',

384
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,653
you silly-ass bastard.

385
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,555
I can't. I'm gonna throw up.

386
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,057
Hey, I don't give a shit!

387
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:28,159
Don't even think
about throwin' up.

388
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,999
I hope you damn choke on it.

389
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,128
I hope you damn choke on it.

390
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:31,762
I've been smellin' it
for a damn month,

391
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:34,065
and I didn't
ask you to come here

392
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:36,467
and stomp the fuck
around in it, neither.

393
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:38,703
Now, who the hell are you?

394
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:41,572
And what the fuck do you want?

395
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:44,475
They don't cut
your hair here, do they?

396
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:46,043
What?!

397
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:47,411
No, I didn't mean it
the wrong way.

398
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,314
I'm just saying, I--I--
I have not been able

399
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,616
to find anyone to cut
my hair, you know,

400
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,085
since St. Louis.

401
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:55,686
Uh, listen,

402
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,656
I'm sorry I stomped
around in your messings.

403
00:30:58,657 --> 00:30:59,999
I--I--I really--

404
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,158
I--I--I really--

405
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,760
Look, I'm with
the war department.

406
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:06,330
I'm trying to find out
about Valentine Casey.

407
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,432
He was reported alive

408
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:09,700
and marshaling in Los tragos

409
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,569
when you were ridin'
with the Henrys

410
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,305
during that Christmas
payroll robbery massacre

411
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:15,272
last year.

412
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,575
Who you calling a massacreer?

413
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:19,744
No, no, nobody, no, no.

414
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:22,113
It's just
there were some killings...

415
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:24,482
And I need to be clear on
wh happened, that's all.

416
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,317
Yeah? Well,
I'll just clear you up

417
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:28,753
on old val Casey.

418
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:29,999
Everybody makes him out
to be somethin'.

419
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,356
Everybody makes him out
to be somethin'.

420
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:36,227
Act like he's all up
and above everybody else.

421
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:39,063
He ain't no better than
the rest of them damn Henrys,

422
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,265
because that's what he is, too.

423
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,366
One of 'em.

424
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,001
Yeah, a Henry.

425
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:46,337
I bet you didn't
know that, did you?

426
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:48,205
Huh, government man?

427
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,440
Bet you didn't know that.

428
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:51,142
I--we, uh,

429
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:53,110
well, yes, we were aware

430
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,146
that he did live with the Henrys

431
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:57,047
when his own family died.

432
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,984
Well, were you we all aware

433
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:00,000
that when he lived with 'em,

434
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,452
that when he lived with 'em,

435
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:03,020
he rode with 'em

436
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,256
when they went and burned
those people alive

437
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,323
at the tuttle ranch?

438
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:08,159
Huh? No, sir.

439
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,127
No, sir. You weren't, were you?

440
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,696
I think there's something
on record in our files

441
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,732
about an incident and a fire,

442
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:17,468
but as far as I know,
there was no indication

443
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:19,503
that he was either
on the premises

444
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:20,971
or involved in any way.

445
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:23,507
Well, I'm indicatin' it to you,

446
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,042
government man.

447
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:26,143
I'll note that.

448
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:28,446
Have you come across him
since the robbery?

449
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,999
Hell, no. I ain't seen him.

450
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,148
Hell, no. I ain't seen him.

451
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:32,516
Well, do know if anyone--

452
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,218
Even the Henrys, perhaps--

453
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:37,355
Might know where he might be?

454
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:55,240
Oh, no.

455
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,413
Oh, come on.

456
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:05,382
Give some to daddy.
Give some to daddy.

457
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,318
Oh, my God.

458
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,419
Oh, no, no. Don't do that.

459
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,020
Oh, goddamn.

460
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,022
Oh, no. Oh, please.

461
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:16,160
Oh, hey, hey! No, stop! Stop it.

462
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,429
Oh, deputy! Oh, no.

463
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,064
Bills!

464
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:24,635
See if that beaner bitch
of his is out yonder again.

465
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:26,438
For Christ's sake,
I can't sleep.

466
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:33,011
Get on out of here!

467
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,117
Damn you, little bitch!

468
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:42,153
Go on, now, git!

469
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,323
Go on!

470
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,492
Goddamn you, Harris!

471
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:49,527
Goddamn it!

472
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,662
I didn't get my nut off!

473
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:54,999
You worthless cocksucker!

474
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,734
I'm gonna kill you twice,
Harris!

475
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:59,036
I'm gonna kill you twice!

476
00:33:59,037 --> 00:33:59,999
Goddamn you!

477
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,506
Goddamn you!

478
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:08,145
You so much as flinch
or even worm wiggle...

479
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,446
You done with him?

480
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,681
Fine.

481
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:12,116
Are you done yet?

482
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:15,220
Damn it, I ain't got time
for this horse shit.

483
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,999
Goddamn you, Harris!

484
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,069
Goddamn you, Harris!

485
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,307
Ahh.

486
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:42,680
Oh...

487
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:45,150
My shoe is ruined.

488
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,355
Oh, excuse me, ma'am.

489
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:53,625
I wonder if I could
get cleaned up in here?

490
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,628
Do you speak English?

491
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,263
Um, I...

492
00:34:59,264 --> 00:34:59,999
Oh--oh, my God.

493
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,131
Oh--oh, my God.

494
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,501
Boy, I think I'm gonna faint.

495
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:55,520

00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:44,636

00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:51,076
Hello? Hello?

506
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,715

00:36:58,616 --> 00:36:59,999
Excuse me.

And... My pants?

513
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,672
Have you seen my "pantos?"

514
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:23,373
My "panto-titos?"

515
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:25,743
Uh, "pantos."

Oh, yeah.

Don't.

00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:47,431
Don't?

526
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,167
Who said don't?

527
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,105
Is that what you said, "don't"?

528
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:56,373
Hey.

529

What the hell are you doing?

531
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:04,982
I just--I think--

532
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:07,451
It's just the man seems
hurt something terrible.

533
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:10,654
Not you, you leech-lipped
yankee bastard.

534
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,723
What's my whore doin' between

Hey, bitch. Give me

00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:40,751
Uh-huh.

548
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:43,020
Mommy's gonna whip the dog shit

549
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:45,590
out of her little
government man.

550
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:23,648
Well, come on in
or get back out.

551
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,984
Would you be so kind
as to direct me

552
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,999
to the man called
Angus dunfries?

553
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,280
To the man called
Angus dunfries?

554
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:38,295
He's across the road
in the livery there.

555
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:40,497
What are you needin' with him?

556
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,368
Well, I'll be needing
to speak to him presently.

557
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,037
Thank you for the information

558
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:49,039
as to his whereabouts.

559
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,709
Who's that with you?

560
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:56,381
That would be
your daughter, adalyne.

561
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,550
Where you been, addy?

562
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,595
Hey, who the hell are you?

563
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:13,330
I'm the man who brought her here

564
00:42:13,331 --> 00:42:15,399
to speak with her Uncle,
your brother,

565
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,535
the man they call Angus.

566
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:21,038
Well, he ain't gonna talk to you

567
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,573
you call him Angus!

568
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,575
Nobody calls him Angus.

569
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:28,046
Helluva lot you know!
His name's doc.

570
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:29,999
Well, go on, walk away!

571
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,082
Well, go on, walk away!

572
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,586
You'll come back and find me
if you want to speak to him,

573
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:37,554
you will.

574
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,657
No, no, no.

575
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:44,061
I will not!

576
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,095
Some...

577
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:46,730
Far off place

578
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,765
where nobody knows...

579
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,567
How to be with her.

580
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,601
And--and--

581
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:54,037
And look what that other place

582
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:55,272
caused you.

583
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:57,207
The place didn't do that.

584
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,409
Well, all I know is

585
00:42:59,410 --> 00:42:59,999
you was fine...
When you left here.

586
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,446
You was fine...
When you left here.

587
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:04,247
It's not why
it happened, Uncle Angus.

588
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,382
I don't want to talk about me.

589
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:08,151
I don't want...

590
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:10,220
Whatever caused that to happen

591
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:12,590
to happen to her.

592
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:17,594
She don't need none of 'em.

593
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,664
Goddamn it, she ain't deaf!

594
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:29,639
Maggie!

595
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,000
Margaret Nora!

596
00:43:30,001 --> 00:43:31,375
Margaret Nora!

597
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:51,495
Now, you see?

598
00:43:51,496 --> 00:43:54,999
She hears me fine.

599
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:06,677
Maggie, come on.

600
00:44:33,304 --> 00:44:35,438
I know, I know...

601
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,041
Come with me.

602
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:04,467
Mr. dunfries?

603
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:06,336
I've got, uh, some horses

604
00:45:06,337 --> 00:45:08,438

605
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:11,174

00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:15,613
with saddlers we need
to put inside.

608
00:45:18,616 --> 00:45:20,718
Would that be all right,
Mr. dunfries?

609
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,626
Yeah. Uh...

610
00:45:29,627 --> 00:45:30,000
You can put 'em in--

611
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:31,361
You can put 'em in--

612
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:33,230
In that barn in the--

613
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,532
In the second stable.

614
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:37,335
Here you go, val.

615
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:49,680
They rent rooms at
that depot over there?

616
00:45:53,985 --> 00:45:55,318
Oh, yeah.

617
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:58,255
Uh...

618
00:45:58,256 --> 00:45:59,999
That's my, uh,
brother's railroad hotel.

619
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,458
That's my, uh,
brother's railroad hotel.

620
00:46:01,459 --> 00:46:06,029
Yeah, uh, 2 bits, uh, each.

621
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,631
That's fair.

622
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:09,266
And, uh...

623
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:11,302
You can use the tub.

624
00:46:12,637 --> 00:46:14,271
All right.

625
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:15,973
Well, thank you.

Uh...

it's 10 cents extra.

630
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,321
It's 10 cents extra.

631
00:46:30,322 --> 00:46:32,656
Now...

632
00:46:32,657 --> 00:46:34,291
You have to tell 'em
that, so they know

633
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:35,992

00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:37,294
All right.

635
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:39,030
Ok, thank you.

636
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:50,473

00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:38,355
No, that's not necessary.

we're done with business.

663
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:55,405
Mr. dunfries, I'd like
to order a round of cognac

664
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:57,440
for you and your associate...

665
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,999
As well as Mr. Casey here...

666
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,478
As well as Mr. Casey here...

667
00:48:00,479 --> 00:48:03,480
In anticipation
of a successful conclusion

668
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:05,281
to your business transactions

669
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:07,350
with shoshone bill

670
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:08,752
and his frontier show.

671
00:48:08,753 --> 00:48:11,488
And I might add that
I did see his show

672
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:13,189
in St. Louis...

673
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,725
And indeed, it was, uh...

674
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,027
An extravaganza
of Western performance

675
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:20,630
unequaled by anything
I've run across yet.

676
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:22,365
And that includes New York shows

677
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:25,969
and circuses from Europe.

678
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:28,671
Well, I ain't got no cognac.

679
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:29,999
Napoleon's Brandy.
Now, I got that.

680
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,708
Napoleon's Brandy.
Now, I got that.

681
00:48:31,709 --> 00:48:35,445
It's a $2 bottle
if that'll suit you.

682
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:39,316
Of course, that's fine.
Brandy's fine.

683
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:41,986
Well, good.

684
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:46,389
Actually, alcohol goes
straight through me.

685
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,225
No, thank you.

686
00:48:59,637 --> 00:49:00,000
Oh, yes.

687
00:49:00,001 --> 00:49:01,671
Oh, yes.

688
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:03,673
I'm surprised
you were able to keep

689
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:06,042
that bottle back there
long enough to gather dust.

690
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:07,644
Well, there might be

691
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:09,546
a whole lot about me

692
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:12,249
that would surprise you,
little girl.

693
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:19,123
Thank you.

694
00:49:21,392 --> 00:49:22,725
You came from Canada?

695
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:24,428
What?

696
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,430
Excuse me, I was--

697
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:29,432
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

698
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:29,999
I was just gonna
thank the gentleman

699
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,201
I was just gonna
thank the gentleman

700
00:49:31,202 --> 00:49:32,168
for the Brandy.

701
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:34,071
Oh, you're quite welcome.

702
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:37,674
I'm brigadier smalls.

703
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:41,110
And this is my associate,
Mr. Babcock.

704
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:46,383
And may I introduce you
to adalyne dunfries.

705
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,320
Valentine Casey is your name,

706
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:51,555
am I correct?

707
00:49:53,591 --> 00:49:55,992
Yeah, that's correct.

708
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,762
Miss dunfries, it's
a pleasure to meet you.

709
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:02,165
Gentlemen, this is
my partner, U.S. Christmas.

710
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:05,969
Mr. smalls and Mr. Babcock, yes,

711
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:07,036
and miss dunfries.

712
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:08,305
How do you do?

713
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:10,708
Howdy.

714
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:14,177
I saw on your trunk Montreal.

715
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:16,246
I thought you must be
traveling from Canada.

716
00:50:16,247 --> 00:50:19,048
Yes. Yes, I was in Canada.

717
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:21,985
My daughter's just
returned from Canada

718
00:50:21,986 --> 00:50:24,053
and doesn't seem
to approve of our

719
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:26,657
cordial consumption
of libation, chief.

720
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:29,727
What was that like?

721
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:32,462
What?

722
00:50:32,463 --> 00:50:34,597
Uh, Canada.

723
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:36,232
I'm sorry.

724
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:37,967
I've just never known
anybody that came down

725
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:40,403
from Canada. I'm curious.

726
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:43,439
Well, it was pleasurable,

727
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,542
invigorating,

728
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:46,709
inspirational.

729
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,611
The people there
are very civilized.

730
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:51,514
Oh, dear, we may not
be civilized enough

731
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:53,417
for my daughter's taste, chief.

732
00:50:54,585 --> 00:50:57,187
Was it, uh, cold?

733
00:50:59,356 --> 00:50:59,999
Oh, I--I--

734
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,491
Oh, I--I--

735
00:51:01,492 --> 00:51:03,393
I don't know, I--I--
I was there doing a play

736
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:04,761
and I didn't go out
in the daytime.

737
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:05,728
In the evening,
they sent a coach

738
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,363
to take me to the theater, so--

739
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:09,966
Whoa, the theater!

740
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:11,301
The theater.

741
00:51:11,302 --> 00:51:14,070
Well, now, we're gonna have
to be on our best behavior

742
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:17,073
and try and be civilized, chief.

743
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:20,076
Otherwise, she might
leave me again,

744
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,345
and I don't think
I could stand that.

745
00:51:22,346 --> 00:51:24,380
I may not survive the way I done

746
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:26,350
when she left me that last time.

747
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:29,999
Did you have
a chance to look out.

748
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,720
Did you have
a chance to look out

749
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:32,723
your hotel window?

750
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:37,193
W-why?

751
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:39,662
Well, were the people
outside wearing coats

752
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:41,631
like it was cold?

753
00:51:41,632 --> 00:51:44,567
Yes. Yes, they were
wearing coats.

754
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:46,636
Yes, it is--
It's very cold

755
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:49,038
in Canada in the winter.

756
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:52,109
But it's very beautiful
if you're in love.

757
00:51:54,378 --> 00:51:57,113
Now, burl.

758
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,649
Oh. Oh, I did survive,
though, didn't I?

759
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:00,000
You know I did, chief.

760
00:52:00,001 --> 00:52:01,084
You know I did, chief.

761
00:52:01,085 --> 00:52:03,319
I done just fine without her.

762
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,387
Settle down.

763
00:52:04,388 --> 00:52:06,756
Did you come back
to hurt me some more?

764
00:52:06,757 --> 00:52:09,125
Burl, stop it.
You're scaring Maggie.

765
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,994
She come back to haunt me

766
00:52:10,995 --> 00:52:11,995
is what she done.

767
00:52:11,996 --> 00:52:14,564
She's a damn ghost.

768
00:52:14,565 --> 00:52:17,133
Well, she ain't gonna haunt me!

769
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:20,236
No, she ain't gonna torment me!

770
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:23,573
No, not no damn ghost! Uh-uh...

771
00:52:23,574 --> 00:52:26,609
Go on, get the hell away
from me, damn ghost!

772
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,678
Put that goddamn sword down!

773
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:29,999
Go on, you damn ghost!

774
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,180
Go on, you damn ghost!

775
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:33,684
Put that goddamn--

776
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:42,558
Oh!

777
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:43,559
Oh, God.

778
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,229
Oh, it's adalyne! No...

779
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:48,698
Daddy, you've got to stop.
You've got to calm down.

780
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:50,567
It's not mama, it's me.
It's addy!

781
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:56,173
Grab him.

782
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:59,543
Come on. Come on, damn it.

783
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,252
Shh...

784
00:53:16,994 --> 00:53:18,361
Edgar, would you please tell doc

785
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:19,996
that I've taken Maggie up

786
00:53:19,997 --> 00:53:21,130
to stay with me tonight.

787
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:22,433
<i>Sí.</i>

788
00:53:38,082 --> 00:53:41,984
You all came back
for the little girl?

789
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:44,554
Well, miss dunfries did.

790
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:47,156
Mr. Babcock and I escorted her.

791
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:49,192
She intends
to take her with her?

792
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:50,159
Indeed.

793
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,162
I believe that's what she'll do.

794
00:53:53,764 --> 00:53:56,734
Her journey brought her
back here for that reason.

795
00:53:58,135 --> 00:53:59,999
The child's father doesn't
seem willing to allow it.

796
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,040
The child's father doesn't
seem willing to allow it.

797
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,342
Well, her Uncle Angus
is lost on his own path.

798
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:10,446
Adalyne's tribulations
rose like sea billows

799
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:12,749
and crashed into her heart.

800
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,485
She fell loose from this life

801
00:54:15,486 --> 00:54:18,721
and slid across
to the other side.

802
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:21,457
But her time was not now,

803
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:24,494
and she was led back...

804
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:26,162
And lovingly compelled

805
00:54:26,163 --> 00:54:28,598
by her soul's divine conscience

806
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:29,999
to complete
this earthly passage.

807
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,101
To complete
this earthly passage.

808
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,670
How long was it?

809
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:37,207
She was gone, I mean?

810
00:54:39,143 --> 00:54:40,243
Unlike you and I,

811
00:54:40,244 --> 00:54:42,246
she retains her sense of smell.

812
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:45,182
Excuse me?

813
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:50,353
My olfactory recall
is limited to...

814
00:54:50,354 --> 00:54:53,422
Axle grease from
the wheels of a train...

815
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:56,692
Leather seats
in a Pullman car...

816
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:59,999
And tonic
on the hair of porters.

817
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,430
And tonic
on the hair of porters.

818
00:55:00,431 --> 00:55:03,032
Hair tonic?

819
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:04,534
Well, these were the objects

820
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:06,269
that I was in
the closest proximity to

821
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:08,338
at the time of my mortal demise.

822
00:55:11,008 --> 00:55:12,642
I believe that you and I
share in common

823
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:14,978
this olfactorous malady.

824
00:55:19,283 --> 00:55:23,152
Well, if you gentlemen
will excuse us...

825
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,188
Babcock and I have had a long

826
00:55:25,189 --> 00:55:27,290
and exhausting journey.

827
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:29,158
So, we'll bid you good night

828
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:29,999
and retire to our rooms.

829
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,361
And retire to our rooms.

830
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:42,673
Good night.

831
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:49,379
Now, he's an odd bird.

832
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,515
Yeah.

833
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:22,699
Good morning, Mr. Casey.

834
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:28,671
Good morning, miss dunfries.
How are you?

835
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:29,999
I'm fine, thank you.

836
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,107
I'm fine, thank you.

837
00:58:31,108 --> 00:58:33,142
Is the little girl all right?

838
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:36,212
Margaret. Yes, she's doing
much better this morning.

839
00:58:36,213 --> 00:58:37,446
You had a restful sleep?

840
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:40,717
Not altogether,
but thank you for asking.

841
00:58:45,589 --> 00:58:47,423
She seems very fond of you.

842
00:58:47,424 --> 00:58:50,593
You're wanting
to take her with you?

843
00:58:50,594 --> 00:58:53,129
Yes, to the Berkeley school
for the deaf and the blind.

844
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:55,564
It's near San Francisco.

845
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:57,600
Well, I hope her father
allows you to.

846
00:58:57,601 --> 00:58:59,535
Well, it seems Uncle Angus
had a change of heart

847
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,000
during the night.
We spoke this morning,

848
00:59:00,001 --> 00:59:01,404
during the night.
We spoke this morning,

849
00:59:01,405 --> 00:59:03,372
and he's agreed
to let me take her.

850
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,174
Well, if there's any hope
for her salvation,

851
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:07,477
it would appear to be you.

852
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:10,713
I'm not much of a savior,

853
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,181
but I love her,

854
00:59:12,182 --> 00:59:13,983
and I'm gonna try
to give her a life

855
00:59:13,984 --> 00:59:15,151
that means something.

856
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:18,588
I think you can probably
save her just fine.

857
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:24,027
Well, I wish you the best.

858
00:59:24,995 --> 00:59:26,095
Have a good day.

859
00:59:26,096 --> 00:59:26,763
Thank you.

860
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,373
Was no risk at any time

861
00:59:37,374 --> 00:59:40,743
of men on the stairway
of that sweet little balloon

862
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:44,747
because I practice
3 to 6 hours every day.

863
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:46,549
I have honed my skills.

864
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:49,285
I will use this third
tomahawk and take it

865
00:59:49,286 --> 00:59:51,253
and throw it in between
the first 2 tomahawks

866
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,222
and burst that little balloon.

867
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:54,490
Now if you'll looky here,

868
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:55,524
well, there's not much room left

869
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:57,159
between these first 2 tomahawks,

870
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,261
barely 2 fingers,

871
00:59:59,262 --> 00:59:59,999
but with my skill I can do it

872
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,163
but with my skill I can do it

873
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:05,634
from 10--no, let's make
that 13 paces just for luck.

874
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:08,637
Some folks says 13's
a unlucky number,

875
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:12,308
but I say no. That's a lucky
number for jesco lynch,

876
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:14,110
the tomahawk hatchet thrower,

877
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,178
the legend of all
the great plains

878
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:18,047
and the Indian territories.

879
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:19,748
Ladies and gentlemen,
let me introduce...

880
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:21,050
Valentine Casey.

881
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:24,386
Mr. Casey, allow me
to buy you breakfast.

882
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:25,621
How ya doin', bill?

883
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,556
Just great. Val, gettin'
that cable last month

884
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:29,999
was like hearin' a voice
from the grave.

885
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:30,160
Was like hearin' a voice
from the grave.

886
01:00:30,161 --> 01:00:31,694
Luke, this indeed

887
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:34,563
is the gallant lieutenant Casey.

888
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:35,764
Or what's left of him.
How you doin'?

889
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:37,133
Fine, thank you.

890
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:40,269
Honey, show the clippin's
out the Tulsa newspaper

891
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:41,637
to Mr. guthries here.

892
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,539
After you get finished here,
do you mind

893
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,674
takin' those horses down
and let him look at 'em?

894
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:46,742
Sure.

895
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:48,410
Thank you, Mr. lynch.

896
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:51,480
At 13 paces, I call my throw

897
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,382
to take this tomahawk hatchet

898
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:54,517
and put it in the middle

899
01:00:54,518 --> 01:00:57,020
and burst that little balloon.

900
01:01:02,626 --> 01:01:06,329
Well, not bad
for an old bushwhacker.

901
01:01:20,544 --> 01:01:23,579
Well, mister, if you're ready,

902
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:26,015
I reckon we can go
move them horses now.

903
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:26,749
All right. That's fine,

904
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:29,118
and, bill, I thank you
for the breakfast

905
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:29,999
and I'll see you back at camp.

906
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:30,387
And I'll see you back at camp.

907
01:01:30,388 --> 01:01:31,320
You're welcome, Luke.

908
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:32,989
See you down there in a while.

909
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:37,693
Your friend has
a strange sense of fashion.

910
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:40,329
Yeah, he's kinda
sentimental about the dress.

911
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:41,697
How's that?

912
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,366
Well, his family used
to work coolie camps,

913
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,534
and when he was about,

914
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,470
I don't know,
3 or 4 years old, I guess,

915
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:50,539
there was this renegade band
of mescalero apaches

916
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,007
that broke off the reservation.

917
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:53,576
They started raidin' camps.

918
01:01:53,577 --> 01:01:57,680
And one afternoon they
raided his family's camp...

919
01:01:57,681 --> 01:01:58,714
And his mother was
quick enough thinkin'

920
01:01:58,715 --> 01:01:59,999
that she put him
in a little girl's dress,

921
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,116
that she put him
in a little girl's dress,

922
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:04,253
and they kidnapped him along
with the rest of the women,

923
01:02:04,254 --> 01:02:07,189
and he stayed alive that way
long enough for an army detail

924
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:08,290
to catch up with 'em
and rescue 'em.

925
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:12,361
Well, that might could
make a man have a fondness

926
01:02:12,362 --> 01:02:14,163
for wearin' dresses.

927
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:16,665
Yeah, I guess.
He's not too much stranger

928
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:18,668
than the rest of 'em
out here, though.

929
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:33,683
Is this fella an Indian?

930
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:37,254
I have no idea.

931
01:02:40,357 --> 01:02:43,759
No, that's probably enough.

932
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,327
Are these <i>calientes?</i>

933
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:47,229
<i>Son muy picosos.</i>

934
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:48,564
Do you have a sack, a tote?

935
01:02:48,565 --> 01:02:52,101
Yes, yes. <i>¿Sophia,</i>
<i>donde está LA bolsa?</i>

936
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:53,970
<i>Sí, LA bolsa.</i>

937
01:02:56,006 --> 01:02:59,275
Oh, yeah, that's good.
That'd be great.

938
01:02:59,276 --> 01:02:59,999
Good morning, Sophia.
Good morning, Edgar.

939
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,644
Good morning, Sophia.
Good morning, Edgar.

940
01:03:01,645 --> 01:03:03,445
<i>Buenos días, señorita.</i>

941
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:04,413
That's good. I'll come out there

942
01:03:04,414 --> 01:03:06,148
and get that other thing
in a minute.

943
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:08,050
Mr. Casey.

944
01:03:08,051 --> 01:03:11,020
I understand you're
a friend of major guthries'.

945
01:03:11,021 --> 01:03:13,589
Yeah, bill and I are friends,

946
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:16,558
but please call me val,
miss dunfries.

947
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:20,696
Oh, then, I'd like it
if you'd call me adalyne, val.

948
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:23,999
And if it wouldn't
be an imposition,

949
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,601
could you introduce me
to Mr. guthries

950
01:03:25,602 --> 01:03:27,269
so that I might pay him
to take Margaret and me

951
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:29,638
on the spur train to where
it joins the mainline?

952
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,000
It's not an imposition.

953
01:03:30,001 --> 01:03:31,106
It's not an imposition.

954
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,709
You're not traveling
with brigadier smalls

955
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:35,244
and Mr. Babcock any longer?

956
01:03:35,245 --> 01:03:37,146
No. No, they're gone now.

957
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:39,415
They left earlier this morning,

958
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:42,751
so I guess I'm gonna have
to do that saving on my own.

959
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:45,087
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.

960
01:03:45,088 --> 01:03:46,422
No, I know you didn't.

961
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:48,691
When you're finished
with breakfast there,

962
01:03:48,692 --> 01:03:52,294
I'll take you down to meet bill.

963
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:53,729
Thank you.

964
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:56,633
You're welcome... Edgar?

965
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,245
Hey, bill.

966
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:11,314
Hey, val.

967
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,753
Margaret, you come on now.

968
01:04:17,754 --> 01:04:21,124
You're gonna have a little
float in the balloon.

969
01:04:27,397 --> 01:04:29,231
I rode one once.

970
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:29,999
Montreal.

971
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,667
Montreal.

972
01:04:31,668 --> 01:04:35,071
Uh-huh. Was it cold?

973
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:42,979
I don't recall.
I was in love at the time.

974
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:45,982
So you said last night.

975
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,751
Miss dunfries, why
don't you join Margaret

976
01:04:48,752 --> 01:04:50,987
for a little float
in the balloon?

977
01:04:51,755 --> 01:04:53,490
Excuse me.

978
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:08,270
Pretty wild rig.

979
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:11,440
Yeah, it's a lot of fun, though.

980
01:05:11,441 --> 01:05:14,743
Where you headed after our
finish our horse tradin'?

981
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,645
I've got some business
with some folks

982
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:18,147
I think are nearby.

983
01:05:18,148 --> 01:05:20,216
I suppose it couldn't wait.

984
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:24,187
No, not really.

985
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:27,723
I was thinking that
a trip to California

986
01:05:27,724 --> 01:05:29,291
might be pleasurable for you.

987
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:29,999
You could see
the whole frontier show

988
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,260
you could see
the whole frontier show

989
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:32,461
before we go on tour

990
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:33,562
to South America and Europe.

991
01:05:33,563 --> 01:05:37,132
That'd be nice, but I just
can't do it right now.

992
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:40,536
Well, truthfully, I was
surprised to hear from you.

993
01:05:40,537 --> 01:05:42,604
I think I was a bit confused

994
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:46,308
about what happened
to you after Cuba.

995
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:48,044
Yeah.

996
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,649
Cuba gets sorta foggy
for me after I was shot.

997
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:58,120
It was good down there
until then. Most of it.

998
01:05:58,121 --> 01:05:59,155
You think?

999
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:04,360
Seemed like.

1000
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:08,063
Gustoff!

1001
01:06:08,064 --> 01:06:10,500
Gustoff, put it down.

1002
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:13,435
How did she get to know smalls?

1003
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:16,004
I'm not sure. I don't know.

1004
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:18,240
She came down
from Canada with him.

1005
01:06:18,241 --> 01:06:20,242
He and that other gentleman
were having breakfast

1006
01:06:20,243 --> 01:06:22,744
when I walked in. I don't
think he ever remembered

1007
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:24,379
meeting me before.

1008
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:27,550
When I knew him he was
a big railroad gambler.

1009
01:06:29,686 --> 01:06:30,000
A couple of years ago,
I heard he got killed

1010
01:06:30,001 --> 01:06:32,154
a couple of years ago,
I heard he got killed

1011
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:36,192
over a cheat he
got caught in in cards.

1012
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:42,564
You ever been up
in one of those things?

1013
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:45,567
They're magnificent.

1014
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:46,568
I don't know why,

1015
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:48,504
but you seem to care
less about things,

1016
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:52,007
anything really,
when you're up in one.

1017
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,343
Come on, Valentine.
Let me have gustoff

1018
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:57,213
show you how to float
one of those balloons.

1019
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:09,592
You fellas got hold of this?

1020
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:14,631
Hang on now.

1021
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:18,233
Oh...

1022
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:20,402
Hey.

1023
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:23,071
Hey, how ya doin'?

1024
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:26,708
Mr. Casey, you fellas
did a real fine job

1025
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,076
breakin' these horses.

1026
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:29,711
I reckon we're
gonna take 'em all.

1027
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:30,000
U.S. and me, we been hagglin'
and fussin' over prices.

1028
01:07:30,001 --> 01:07:32,648
U.S. and me, we been hagglin'
and fussin' over prices.

1029
01:07:32,649 --> 01:07:35,217
And we finally came up
with $50 around

1030
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:37,719
for those saddle horses
and 25 for the broncs.

1031
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,222
That'll be OK, Luke.
We'll take the price.

1032
01:07:40,223 --> 01:07:43,559
How far you plannin'
on goin' in that thang?

1033
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,693
Not very.

1034
01:07:44,694 --> 01:07:46,728
Begins now.

1035
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:49,231
Hey, hold it pardner.
What--where you goin'?

1036
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:52,734
Hey, now. Hold up there!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hang on!

1037
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:54,370
What are you--how--

1038
01:07:55,505 --> 01:07:57,439
Wait a minute. I ain't
got the hang of this.

1039
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,474
Hang on there! Hey, hold on now!

1040
01:07:59,475 --> 01:07:59,999
How hard do I pull this?

1041
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,044
How hard do I pull this?

1042
01:08:02,045 --> 01:08:03,679
Hey! Whoa! Whoa-whoa!

1043
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,648
Whoa! Wh-what?!

1044
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:09,518
Hey, that's enough!
That--that's enough.

1045
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:11,987
Stop right there.

1046
01:08:11,988 --> 01:08:14,990
Hey, bill. Bill,
how long's that rope?

1047
01:08:14,991 --> 01:08:17,527
Yeah, I wouldn't, uh--
That's probably enough.

1048
01:08:18,528 --> 01:08:23,231
Use your megaphone to tell us

1049
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:26,435
how high you want to go.

1050
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:29,438
This is! No more! That's enough!

1051
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:29,999
You have about 50 feet out now.

1052
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,307
You have about 50 feet out now.

1053
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:34,643
We'll give you more.

1054
01:08:34,644 --> 01:08:37,280
Could you--could you
hand me that?

1055
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:40,515
Are you all right?

1056
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:42,718
Uh-huh, yeah.

1057
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:45,687
Bill, stop!
Just stop right there!

1058
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:48,123
No, right there! Right there!

1059
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:51,294
Stop! That--that--
That's enough!

1060
01:08:53,029 --> 01:08:55,632
Ok, we'll stop.

1061
01:09:01,537 --> 01:09:04,439
Ooh. Are you sure you're OK?

1062
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:09,978
Uh, yeah. Uh, I mean--
I just--I think maybe

1063
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:14,751
if I just sit down here
for a minute, I'll be OK.

1064
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:26,695
Wow, we're up here now, huh?

1065
01:09:26,696 --> 01:09:28,563
Mm-hmm.

1066
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:29,999
Was your last balloon ride
anything like this?

1067
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,970
Was your last balloon ride
anything like this?

1068
01:09:34,971 --> 01:09:37,340
Not exactly.

1069
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:42,045
Yeah.

1070
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:47,582
'Cause it's beautiful
when you're in love?

1071
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:52,187
It's beautiful here.

1072
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,389
Yeah.

1073
01:09:55,224 --> 01:09:59,428
Well, if it--if it
should ever come up

1074
01:09:59,429 --> 01:09:59,999
when you took this balloon
ride, it--it wasn't cold.

1075
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,599
When you took this balloon
ride, it--it wasn't cold.

1076
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:08,571
I might have
a hard time recalling.

1077
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:24,119
Well, I doubt that
I'll remember too much

1078
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:26,355
about the weather...

1079
01:10:31,494 --> 01:10:34,497
Probably just the things
that were beautiful.

1080
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:41,370
You ever been to
San Francisco, val?

1081
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:54,984
Is it cold there?

1082
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,999
Well, according
to Samuel clemens,

1083
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,189
well, according
to Samuel clemens,

1084
01:11:00,190 --> 01:11:01,757
the coldest winter he ever spent

1085
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:05,261
was the summer he
lived in San Francisco.

1086
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:26,415
I'm not too sure about
balloon rides anymore.

1087
01:11:46,569 --> 01:11:49,005
I'm sorry.

1088
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,999
And that poor tormented
wretch down there

1089
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:00,249
and that poor tormented
wretch down there

1090
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:02,285
thinks that I can save him...

1091
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:12,127
But he wouldn't let me
even if I could.

1092
01:12:12,128 --> 01:12:15,298
Yeah, I guess we all hope
for someone to save us.

1093
01:12:18,401 --> 01:12:21,970
I used to wish so bad that
I could have saved my family,

1094
01:12:21,971 --> 01:12:24,340
it made my side sore.

1095
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:28,577
They're gone?

1096
01:12:28,578 --> 01:12:29,999
Yeah. Mmm.

1097
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,448
Yeah. Mmm.

1098
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:37,018
My mother...

1099
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:39,322
My father...

1100
01:12:41,324 --> 01:12:45,728
My sister and little brother.
Influenza killed 'em all.

1101
01:12:51,067 --> 01:12:53,436
Me, I didn't even get sick.

1102
01:12:55,238 --> 01:12:58,506
All anybody can do is try
to save themselves, val,

1103
01:12:58,507 --> 01:12:59,999
and most of us
have forgotten how.

1104
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,611
And most of us
have forgotten how.

1105
01:13:03,246 --> 01:13:05,747
I'm pretty worthless
as a savior,

1106
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:09,485
but I wish you'd come with us.

1107
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:18,193
I guess maybe I could buy a coat

1108
01:13:18,194 --> 01:13:20,161
out in San Francisco, huh?

1109
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:21,631
Yes.

1110
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:55,464
Them dang chi chis is hot!

1111
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:04,072
Why don't you throw that out?

1112
01:14:04,073 --> 01:14:07,009
Uh-uh. Too dang good!

1113
01:14:12,515 --> 01:14:15,584
It's like swallowin'
lit kerosene.

1114
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:19,455
Ahh!

1115
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:23,159
Chihuahua!

1116
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:29,999
It's like eatin'
a mouth full of hot ashes.

1117
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,680
It's like eatin'
a mouth full of hot ashes.

1118
01:14:34,737 --> 01:14:36,672
You reckon--

1119
01:14:38,541 --> 01:14:41,143
You reckon--

1120
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:45,180
You reckon
Chinese food'd be hot?

1121
01:14:45,181 --> 01:14:48,083
I suppose we'll be
eatin' a lot of that

1122
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:50,686
out in San Francisco, huh?

1123
01:14:52,755 --> 01:14:55,725
Yeah, probably.

1124
01:16:08,197 --> 01:16:10,498
You cookin' somethin'?

1125
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:13,369
It smells like
somethin's cookin'.

1126
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:19,608
Do you smell gunpowder?

1127
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:22,611
Yeah.

1128
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:26,548
That's all.

1129
01:16:26,549 --> 01:16:29,999
Well, major, here's
to a successful tour.

1130
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,600
Well, major, here's
to a successful tour.

1131
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:48,137
Edgar?

1132
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:52,674
Edgar! Who told you

1133
01:16:52,675 --> 01:16:56,244
to turn them
goddamn lights out?!

1134
01:16:56,245 --> 01:16:58,646
<i>Que?</i>

1135
01:16:58,647 --> 01:16:59,999
What?

1136
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:00,615
What?

1137
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:03,118
Where the hell are you?

1138
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:04,385
Right here!

1139
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:05,386
Ohh!

1140
01:17:05,387 --> 01:17:06,589
Hey!

1141
01:17:13,496 --> 01:17:16,365
Good evening, gentlemen.

1142
01:17:26,342 --> 01:17:29,999
Whoa! Wha--

1143
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:30,146

1159
01:18:17,493 --> 01:18:20,094
Hey, nogal. Where you goin'?

1160
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:22,730
Taylor didn't say
for you to come in here.

1161
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:25,500
Hey, that woman

01:18:54,163 --> 01:18:56,231

01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:58,433
Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah.

1168
01:18:58,434 --> 01:18:59,999
You can come over here
and give somethin' to daddy.

1169
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,603
You can come over here
and give somethin' to daddy.

1170
01:19:01,604 --> 01:19:02,638
Yeah.

1171
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:07,475
Hey, 'gales, Taylor said

1173
01:19:08,644 --> 01:19:11,012
Goddamn it, I already

1174
01:19:11,013 --> 01:19:13,982
I'm tired a-waitin' on you all.

1175
01:19:13,983 --> 01:19:16,084
Harold, go down and tell Taylor

1176
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:17,485

1178
01:19:20,522 --> 01:19:24,659
You damn bunch of
inbred sons of bitches.

1179
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:27,128
You go tell that fuckin' Taylor

1180
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:29,464

1183
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:33,301

That's $1.00 bottle of whiskey.

1187
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:51,486
I reckon Taylor'll pay
for it when he come back.

1188
01:19:51,487 --> 01:19:53,255
He's gettin' our money.

1189
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:12,006
You know, she ain't just
your girlfriend, arvid.

1190
01:20:12,007 --> 01:20:14,409
I seen her, too.

1191
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:17,046
She gets to be
my girlfriend, too.

1192
01:20:32,761 --> 01:20:35,698
I can just watch you
be with her, arvid.

1193
01:20:36,732 --> 01:20:40,736
Ohh, damn, arvid!

1194
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:46,341
You supposed to get me
to lay with a woman.

1195
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:48,309
That's what your daddy said.

1196
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:50,678
He said I could help
pick her out, too!

1197
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:52,680
Now, goddamn it,

1200
01:20:58,153 --> 01:20:59,999
Harold, you can just

1201
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,456
Harold, you can just
sit there and watch.

1202
01:21:01,457 --> 01:21:05,293
I want you to lay down
with my Uncle jude here.

1203
01:21:05,294 --> 01:21:08,363
I just bet you can
make him feel real good.

1204
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:12,300
Then you and me,
we gonna have us a poke.

1205
01:21:12,301 --> 01:21:15,136
You can do it right here.

1206
01:21:15,137 --> 01:21:16,504

1208
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:20,608

1213
01:21:35,524 --> 01:21:39,360

Can't get my button undone.

1221
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:00,615
Can't get my button undone.

1222
01:22:00,616 --> 01:22:03,419
Wait a second.

01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,457
Well, I can't get

1224
01:22:09,458 --> 01:22:11,326
Move your arm, arvid!

1225
01:22:12,294 --> 01:22:13,462
God! Ohh!

1226

01:22:26,742 --> 01:22:29,999

1232
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:30,312

01:22:30,313 --> 01:22:32,079
Oh, you bitch!

1234
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,748

01:22:45,027 --> 01:22:46,027

1237
01:22:46,028 --> 01:22:49,730
Aah!

1238
01:22:49,731 --> 01:22:51,532
Come back, sheba bitch!

1239
01:22:51,533 --> 01:22:53,468
I'm gonna hurt you hard!

1240
01:22:53,469 --> 01:22:55,636
Damn it! Lookit

1241
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,039
No!

1242
01:23:01,577 --> 01:23:03,010
Aah!

1243
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:05,213
Aah! God almighty, Taylor!

1244
01:23:05,214 --> 01:23:07,415
You damn near shot me.

1245
01:23:07,416 --> 01:23:09,584
Aah, you damn sure did!

1246
01:23:09,585 --> 01:23:12,420
Oh, my God! I can't hear!

1247
01:23:12,421 --> 01:23:16,691
Oh, my God almighty, Taylor!
You struck me deaf!

1248
01:23:16,692 --> 01:23:19,061
Go get the sacks.

1249
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:23,698
You all are worthless.

1250
01:23:23,699 --> 01:23:26,434
I never seen
anything as worthless.

1251
01:23:26,435 --> 01:23:28,503
You can't even rob
a goddamn old man

1252
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:29,999
and his daughter
without pissin' yourselves.

1253
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:30,639
And his daughter
without pissin' yourselves.

1254
01:23:31,707 --> 01:23:33,074
Now I want you to listen...

1255
01:23:33,075 --> 01:23:37,211
With that good ear.
Do what I'm sayin' to ya.

1256
01:23:37,212 --> 01:23:40,114
I want you and that
addle-brained Uncle of ours

1257
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:42,116
to get on a pair
of horses and go,

1258
01:23:42,117 --> 01:23:44,285
and if Harold and I
catch up with you two

1259
01:23:44,286 --> 01:23:45,653
before y'all reach spits,

1260
01:23:45,654 --> 01:23:48,589
I'll shoot you myself.

1261
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:50,759
You understand, arvid?

1262
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:54,196
Where is he?

1263
01:23:55,297 --> 01:23:58,734
He's upstairs all cut up.
I don't think he can ride.

1264
01:24:00,135 --> 01:24:01,435
Cut up how?

1265
01:24:01,436 --> 01:24:05,039
That bitch, she burned me!

1266
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:08,042
She like to nearly
cut his nuts off, I think!

1267
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:09,277
Then you and Harvey get a horse

1268
01:24:09,278 --> 01:24:11,546
and tie Uncle jude to it

1269
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:12,747
and tell Nogales to find

1270
01:24:12,748 --> 01:24:14,115
that tooth-pullin' blacksmith

1271
01:24:14,116 --> 01:24:15,249
so we can bring him with us

1272
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:16,751
back down to spits

1273
01:24:16,752 --> 01:24:19,620
so he can sew that old
bastard back together.

1274
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:21,556
Now can you do that, arvid?

1275
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:22,991
Of course!

1276
01:24:25,627 --> 01:24:27,495
I mean, yeah!

1277
01:24:27,496 --> 01:24:29,999
Let's go, Harold.

1278
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:30,680
Let's go, Harold.

1279
01:24:38,473 --> 01:24:40,474
Hey, Harvey!

1280
01:24:40,475 --> 01:24:41,510
Harvey!

1281
01:24:42,611 --> 01:24:45,747
Mmm.

1282
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:51,586
Good mornin', doc.

1283
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:54,122
Grab your boots.

1284
01:24:58,527 --> 01:24:59,999
Hey, Mr. blacksmith.

1285
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:00,800
Hey, Mr. blacksmith.

1286
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:03,331
Look what we found
out in the kitchen

1287
01:25:03,332 --> 01:25:05,199
hidin' in the stove.

1288
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:08,603
Oh, you son of a bitch!
Goddamn it!

1289
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:10,972
Goddamn!

1290
01:25:10,973 --> 01:25:12,506
What the hell's goin' on?

1291
01:25:12,507 --> 01:25:13,674
Where's addy?

1292
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:15,242
Well, I shot her...

1293
01:25:15,243 --> 01:25:16,544
What?

1294
01:25:16,545 --> 01:25:20,015
In there, behind the desk.

1295
01:25:21,216 --> 01:25:25,219
And now I think
I'm gonna shoot her...

1296
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:26,253
Oh, Jesus.

1297
01:25:26,254 --> 01:25:27,521
Unless you do what I say.

1298
01:25:27,522 --> 01:25:29,999
Oh, yeah, I will. Yeah?

1299
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:30,725
Oh, yeah, I will. Yeah?

1300
01:25:30,726 --> 01:25:32,994
I'll do anything you say.

1301
01:25:32,995 --> 01:25:35,696
- That's good.
- Yeah.

1302
01:25:35,697 --> 01:25:37,431
I want you to go

1303
01:25:37,432 --> 01:25:39,400
with my burnt up
brother arvid here

1304
01:25:39,401 --> 01:25:42,103
on over to spits
and see what you can do

1305
01:25:42,104 --> 01:25:45,139
about sewing that other one's
manhood back together.

1306
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:49,243
I'll finish up here,
and I'll come down there,

1307
01:25:49,244 --> 01:25:51,679
and if everything
looks all right,

1308
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:53,414
then you can come back here,

1309
01:25:53,415 --> 01:25:58,285
and Nogales and these boys
will let your little girl go.

1310
01:25:58,286 --> 01:25:59,999
But in the meantime,
we'll see to it

1311
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,189
but in the meantime,
we'll see to it

1312
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:06,193
that she doesn't run off
and go hide in any stoves.

1313
01:26:06,194 --> 01:26:08,296
Please don't do that.

1314
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:11,265
Connie, come over here

1315
01:26:11,266 --> 01:26:13,368
and wet nurse this little bitch.

1316
01:26:14,503 --> 01:26:19,607
Arvid, take the money,
put doc on a horse.

1317
01:26:19,608 --> 01:26:21,008
Get goin'.

1318
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:23,311
Come on!

1319
01:26:29,384 --> 01:26:29,999
I'll see y'all in spits.

1320
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,319
I'll see y'all in spits.

1321
01:26:54,309 --> 01:26:56,110
Come on, Harold.

1322
01:26:56,111 --> 01:26:58,145
Leave that bastard to bleed.

1323
01:26:58,146 --> 01:26:59,999
Let's go.

1324
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:00,500
Let's go.

1325
01:27:12,027 --> 01:27:16,098
Hey, I don't like you...

1326
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:26,340
'Cause I don't like Indians.

1327
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:28,276
Come on.

1328
01:27:33,115 --> 01:27:36,517
Hey, Connie, me, Tim, and Paul

1329
01:27:36,518 --> 01:27:39,253
is gonna go on down
to Josie's place.

1330
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:41,623
You wait here
about 10 minutes...

1331
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:46,161
Then kill her and come on.

1332
01:28:22,664 --> 01:28:25,032
Hey, mister.

1333
01:28:25,033 --> 01:28:26,568
Touch this.

1334
01:29:04,539 --> 01:29:06,441
Ho! Ho!

1335
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:09,377
Ho!

1336
01:29:17,118 --> 01:29:18,719
Edgar, what went on here?

1337
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,688
They shoot and
they kill everybody.

1338
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:22,324
Addy?

1339
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:26,694
Is she all right?

1340
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:29,396
Probably not...

1341
01:29:29,397 --> 01:29:29,999
But she'll be better

1342
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:30,365
but she'll be better

1343
01:29:30,366 --> 01:29:33,334
the sooner I get her
away from here.

1344
01:29:33,335 --> 01:29:36,403
Are you all right?

1345
01:29:36,404 --> 01:29:39,673
Probably not,

1346
01:29:39,674 --> 01:29:42,210
but I won't die from this.

1347
01:29:47,582 --> 01:29:49,083
Where's Angus?

1348
01:29:49,084 --> 01:29:50,351
They made him go with 'em

1349
01:29:50,352 --> 01:29:52,386
to tend to the one
that was cut up.

1350
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:54,555
Shoshone?

1351
01:29:54,556 --> 01:29:57,124
They shot him, but he'll live.

1352
01:29:57,125 --> 01:29:59,293
He's on the train.

1353
01:29:59,294 --> 01:29:59,999
He needs treatment soon,
so we're leaving

1354
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,329
he needs treatment soon,
so we're leaving

1355
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:06,101
as quick as we can bury daddy.

1356
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:11,005
Are you coming?

1357
01:30:11,006 --> 01:30:13,375
Who did this?

1358
01:30:15,477 --> 01:30:17,345
It doesn't matter.

1359
01:30:21,049 --> 01:30:22,583
I saw Luke.

1360
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:24,385
He paid us for them horses.

1361
01:30:24,386 --> 01:30:26,253
They're loadin' 'em as we speak.

1362
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:27,288
He get caught up in this?

1363
01:30:27,289 --> 01:30:29,999
No. Time he heard of it,
it was all over with...

1364
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,358
No. Time he heard of it,
it was all over with...

1365
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:32,726
But I know who did it, though.

1366
01:30:32,727 --> 01:30:33,661
Who?

1367
01:30:33,662 --> 01:30:36,997
Nogales kid and some
of them damn Henrys.

1368
01:30:36,998 --> 01:30:39,233
Part of 'em took the blacksmith

1369
01:30:39,234 --> 01:30:41,535
and that, uh, one that
was cut up real bad

1370
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:44,171
and took him off to spits
to tend to him.

1371
01:30:44,172 --> 01:30:45,339
You get the rest of those horses

1372
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:46,540
down to Luke and let's go.

1373
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:47,508
All right.

1374
01:30:47,509 --> 01:30:50,278
That won't save anyone.

1375
01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:53,247
I know you can't wait,

1376
01:30:53,248 --> 01:30:56,383
but I'm gonna finish this...

1377
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:58,553
Then I'm comin'
to San Francisco.

1378
01:31:03,191 --> 01:31:06,560
Vengeance won't give
you back what you lost.

1379
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:09,630
This isn't vengeance.
It's justice.

1380
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:12,066
I'm gonna bring 'em back
to stand trial

1381
01:31:12,067 --> 01:31:15,403
for what they did here
and Los tragos.

1382
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:21,543
You're right. I can't wait.

1383
01:31:28,183 --> 01:31:29,484
I've gotta go.

1384
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:50,071
Ow!

1385
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:07,521
What's that on your face?

1386
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:10,190
Axel grease.

1387
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:11,492
It keeps the sting off.

1388
01:32:11,493 --> 01:32:13,060
Where's Uncle jude?

1389
01:32:13,061 --> 01:32:15,729
Inside. That Smith's
doctorin' on him.

1390
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:17,331
Why don't you stay here

1391
01:32:17,332 --> 01:32:19,033
and see to it that
Uncle jude gets sewed up.

1392
01:32:19,034 --> 01:32:20,567
I'm gonna drop back
across the border

1393
01:32:20,568 --> 01:32:22,236
and catch some cattle

1394
01:32:22,237 --> 01:32:24,304
that guthries has
comin' up here.

1395
01:32:24,305 --> 01:32:27,007
Harvey, you come with me.

1396
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:29,043
We'll meet y'all
back at daddy's.

1397
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:29,999
Hey, Taylor,

1398
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:30,445
hey, Taylor,

1399
01:32:30,446 --> 01:32:32,246
can't I watch a minute
him getting sewed on?

1400
01:32:32,247 --> 01:32:33,982
Get on the horse.

1401
01:32:58,206 --> 01:32:59,999
Hey, that weren't empty.

1402
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:00,607
Hey, that weren't empty.

1403
01:33:00,608 --> 01:33:02,476
What?

1404
01:33:02,477 --> 01:33:05,480
That's OK.

1405
01:33:12,987 --> 01:33:14,689
Aaaah!

1406
01:33:16,491 --> 01:33:18,059
Aaaaah!

1407
01:33:23,531 --> 01:33:25,399
Aaaaah!

1408
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:27,167
Oh, shut up!

1409
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:28,335
Good lord!

1410
01:33:28,336 --> 01:33:29,999
My, my grandfather had one loin,

1411
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:30,971
my, my grandfather had one loin,

1412
01:33:30,972 --> 01:33:35,042
and he had one sewed up
in the war,

1413
01:33:35,043 --> 01:33:38,245
and he sired 7 children.

1414
01:33:38,246 --> 01:33:41,116
Goddamn it, count 'em... 7.

1415
01:33:42,517 --> 01:33:44,084
Quit movin' so damn much

1416
01:33:44,085 --> 01:33:45,285
or I'm gonna get
your other ball.

1417
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:47,521
No! Mommy!

1418
01:33:47,522 --> 01:33:49,256
Aah! Aah!

1419
01:33:49,257 --> 01:33:51,693
Aah! Aah!

1420
01:33:57,098 --> 01:33:58,633
Unh!

1421
01:34:01,069 --> 01:34:02,070
Damn!

1422
01:34:13,414 --> 01:34:14,548
No!

1423
01:34:14,549 --> 01:34:17,518
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

1424
01:34:17,519 --> 01:34:20,254
Shh!

1425
01:34:20,255 --> 01:34:22,056
I want you to hear this.

1426
01:34:24,025 --> 01:34:26,593
T-Taylor and arvid done it.

1427
01:34:26,594 --> 01:34:28,162
They done all of it.

1428
01:34:28,163 --> 01:34:29,663
I ain't done nothin'.

1429
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:30,000
Where are they, jude?

1430
01:34:30,001 --> 01:34:31,098
Where are they, jude?

1431
01:34:31,099 --> 01:34:34,368
They went down
to leland's place.

1432
01:34:34,369 --> 01:34:36,503
Where's leland?

1433
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:39,373
Leland's in Mexico.

1434
01:34:39,374 --> 01:34:41,208
Get him on a wagon and let's go.

1435
01:34:41,209 --> 01:34:42,242
Come on!

1436
01:34:42,243 --> 01:34:43,377
No!

1437
01:34:43,378 --> 01:34:44,311
Come on, goddamn it!

1438
01:34:44,312 --> 01:34:46,180
The pain's too much to move me!

1439
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:48,116
Come on!

1440
01:35:07,335 --> 01:35:08,368
Hey, val!

1441
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:10,704
Looky yonder!

1442
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:12,574
What'cha reckon?

1443
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:43,003
Well, it's the marshal
and his whore.

1444
01:35:43,004 --> 01:35:45,639
<i>Buenas días, amigos.</i>

1445
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:48,342
Y'all know assaulting
a U.S. marshal

1446
01:35:48,343 --> 01:35:50,043
is a federal offense.

1447
01:35:50,044 --> 01:35:52,379
Probably hang ya.

1448
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:55,349
Yeah, but he ain't
no marshal no more.

1449
01:35:55,350 --> 01:35:57,384
Are you?

1450
01:35:57,385 --> 01:35:59,186
Nah. He gave that up

1451
01:35:59,187 --> 01:35:59,999
after we rode
through Los tragos.

1452
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,255
After we rode
through Los tragos.

1453
01:36:01,256 --> 01:36:02,656
No. Uh-uh.

1454
01:36:02,657 --> 01:36:06,293
He's been reassigned
to temporary duty.

1455
01:36:06,294 --> 01:36:09,229
Yeah, and what the hell
kind of duty might that be?

1456
01:36:09,230 --> 01:36:12,032
Trackin' y'all down
and killin' ya.

1457
01:36:12,033 --> 01:36:14,668
I'm deferring the execution
of that order

1458
01:36:14,669 --> 01:36:16,470
to my deputy here.

1459
01:36:16,471 --> 01:36:21,108
Corbett, show him your badge
before you shoot him.

1460
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:22,709
Corbett.

1461
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:25,579
Who's corbett?

1462
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:27,648
Why, hell fire.

1463
01:36:27,649 --> 01:36:29,999
Looky here, amigos.

1464
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:30,251
Looky here, amigos.

1465
01:36:30,252 --> 01:36:33,454
Old corbett there
is all badged up.

1466
01:36:37,525 --> 01:36:39,294
I showed them
the badge, marshal!

1467
01:36:42,764 --> 01:36:45,600
Thought I didn't see ya!

1468
01:37:45,293 --> 01:37:48,095
They're not back down there yet.

1469
01:37:48,096 --> 01:37:51,331
It looks like it's leland
and a couple vaqueros.

1470
01:37:51,332 --> 01:37:53,066
I'm gonna go on in.

1471
01:37:53,067 --> 01:37:56,204
If I'm not back here
by tomorrow morning...

1472
01:37:57,705 --> 01:37:59,999
You ride down there
and kill 'em all.

1473
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,440
You ride down there
and kill 'em all.

1474
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:04,379
My pleasure.

1475
01:38:24,198 --> 01:38:25,533
See ya.

1476
01:38:43,017 --> 01:38:45,051
<i>¡Alto!</i>

1477
01:38:45,052 --> 01:38:46,554
<i>No haga eso!</i>

1478
01:39:12,613 --> 01:39:14,981
<i>Cómo esta, Valentine?</i>

1479
01:39:14,982 --> 01:39:17,251
Not very well, leland.

1480
01:39:20,655 --> 01:39:23,256
The prodigal son returns.

1481
01:39:23,257 --> 01:39:26,426
<i>Luke</i> 15, verses 11-32.

1482
01:39:26,427 --> 01:39:28,094
Or should I say,

1483
01:39:28,095 --> 01:39:29,999
"Lazarus this day
raiseth from the dead"?

1484
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,333
"Lazarus this day
raiseth from the dead"?

1485
01:39:34,101 --> 01:39:36,203
I don't know, leland.

1486
01:39:36,204 --> 01:39:39,674
I reckon it could be
a little bit of both.

1487
01:39:40,641 --> 01:39:42,709
It's a peculiar way to state it,

1488
01:39:42,710 --> 01:39:45,378
especially concerning
the information

1489
01:39:45,379 --> 01:39:47,547
I've just been reading
from a satchel

1490
01:39:47,548 --> 01:39:49,716
delivered to me
from the war department

1491
01:39:49,717 --> 01:39:52,552
by the gentleman
out there that's, uh,

1492
01:39:52,553 --> 01:39:54,689
about to perform self-dentistry.

1493
01:39:56,090 --> 01:39:58,493
Agent fishburn otts!

1494
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:00,000
This is lieutenant Casey

1495
01:40:00,001 --> 01:40:01,695
this is lieutenant Casey

1496
01:40:01,696 --> 01:40:04,164
in question throughout
the documents.

1497
01:40:04,165 --> 01:40:06,467
Val, agent otts.

1498
01:40:11,272 --> 01:40:13,340
I've come to arrest you, leland.

1499
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:16,176
Take you back to stand
trial for Los tragos.

1500
01:40:16,177 --> 01:40:18,245
Taylor and the boys
are gonna face trial

1501
01:40:18,246 --> 01:40:19,579
for Los tragos and what went on

1502
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:20,715
in dunfries yesterday.

1503
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:27,188
Sissy! Bring me those papers!

1504
01:40:28,990 --> 01:40:29,999
Sissy! Bring me
those papers about val!

1505
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,157
Sissy! Bring me
those papers about val!

1506
01:40:31,158 --> 01:40:33,293
I'm bringing 'em.

1507
01:40:33,294 --> 01:40:35,595
Sissy! Sissy!

1508
01:40:35,596 --> 01:40:38,466
I can't reach this.
Hand it to me!

1509
01:40:40,001 --> 01:40:41,968
What the hell is wrong with you?

1510
01:40:41,969 --> 01:40:44,505
I'm tryin' to fix
my face right, daddy.

1511
01:40:48,075 --> 01:40:50,210
I guess, uh, sissy's
a little excited

1512
01:40:50,211 --> 01:40:53,080
that you're here, Valentine.

1513
01:40:53,748 --> 01:40:55,215
See that fellow over there

1514
01:40:55,216 --> 01:40:56,383
with the tooth problem, val?

1515
01:40:56,384 --> 01:40:57,584
He's a government man.

1516
01:40:57,585 --> 01:40:58,752
He's had trouble with that tooth

1517
01:40:58,753 --> 01:40:59,999
ever since he came to us,

1518
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:00,454
ever since he came to us,

1519
01:41:00,455 --> 01:41:03,123
so, uh, I had Alejandro
and the boys

1520
01:41:03,124 --> 01:41:04,291
teach him how to take care of

1521
01:41:04,292 --> 01:41:06,726
that problem the Indian way.

1522
01:41:06,727 --> 01:41:09,462
Ain't that right, agent otts?

1523
01:41:09,463 --> 01:41:15,268
Mr. Henry,
since Mr. Casey has arrived,

1524
01:41:15,269 --> 01:41:17,370
perhaps I can be on my way now

1525
01:41:17,371 --> 01:41:19,706
and seek out a proper dentist

1526
01:41:19,707 --> 01:41:21,474
upon my arrival at Tucson.

1527
01:41:21,475 --> 01:41:23,710
I--I really don't think
that anything

1528
01:41:23,711 --> 01:41:26,046
this extreme is necessary.

1529
01:41:26,047 --> 01:41:29,082
The tooth feels
immeasurably better now.

1530
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:29,999
And--and you mentioned
that I might be able

1531
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,252
and--and you mentioned
that I might be able

1532
01:41:32,253 --> 01:41:35,121
to get my wedding ring back.
I would appreciate that.

1533
01:41:35,122 --> 01:41:37,057
But feel free
to keep the crucifix

1534
01:41:37,058 --> 01:41:39,125
as a token of my appreciation

1535
01:41:39,126 --> 01:41:41,661
for your graceful hospitality.

1536
01:41:41,662 --> 01:41:46,466
No, I think we better
take care of that tooth problem.

1537
01:41:46,467 --> 01:41:48,335
A thing like that can turn on ya

1538
01:41:48,336 --> 01:41:50,538
and just give you fits.

1539
01:41:53,608 --> 01:41:56,109
Nogales come across him
when old Sidney

1540
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:59,145
had to stay in a lockup
up across the border.

1541
01:41:59,146 --> 01:41:59,999
How are your arms
holding out, agent otts?

1542
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,082
How are your arms
holding out, agent otts?

1543
01:42:02,083 --> 01:42:03,717
It appears to me you may be near

1544
01:42:03,718 --> 01:42:06,620
the end of your agony.

1545
01:42:06,621 --> 01:42:09,122
The odd thing is
he was looking for

1546
01:42:09,123 --> 01:42:13,193
Valentine Casey's next of kin.

1547
01:42:13,194 --> 01:42:16,696
So Sidney thought
he'd be his personal escort

1548
01:42:16,697 --> 01:42:18,298
and give him safe conduct

1549
01:42:18,299 --> 01:42:23,236
through this, uh, hostile
territory surrounding us

1550
01:42:23,237 --> 01:42:26,207
so that he could bring us
these urgent documents.

1551
01:42:28,142 --> 01:42:29,343
Now...

1552
01:42:30,711 --> 01:42:32,245
It says here in this letter

1553
01:42:32,246 --> 01:42:36,082
in these documents
that you were mortally wounded.

1554
01:42:36,083 --> 01:42:39,552
I guess that means
you were killed, val.

1555
01:42:39,553 --> 01:42:41,521
In the course of an action

1556
01:42:41,522 --> 01:42:43,657
when your company was ambushed

1557
01:42:43,658 --> 01:42:46,227
near the town
of Santiago de Cuba.

1558
01:42:47,695 --> 01:42:50,297
You ever been
to Santiago de Cuba, val?

1559
01:42:51,599 --> 01:42:53,566
Yeah, near there.

1560
01:42:53,567 --> 01:42:55,502
My God, boy.
You look like a ghost

1561
01:42:55,503 --> 01:42:58,305
just brushed up against you.

1562
01:43:00,207 --> 01:43:03,276
See this, val?
A U.S. stamp right on it.

1563
01:43:03,277 --> 01:43:04,311
It's official.

1564

It's official. You can see it.

1585

Fact of business,
it's downright queer.

1586

Aaaah!

Ohh!

1593
01:44:38,405 --> 01:44:43,409
You must be feeling
enormous relief, agent otts.

1594
01:44:43,410 --> 01:44:46,980
Don't speak to me now.

1595
01:44:46,981 --> 01:44:51,184
No need to thank me.
We can talk later...

1596
01:44:51,185 --> 01:44:53,453
Over supper.

1597

Aaah!

1598
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:09,469
Reckon we oughta feed him?

1599
01:45:09,470 --> 01:45:11,070
I don't think I could stomach

1600
01:45:11,071 --> 01:45:13,207
watching that
son of a bitch eat.

1601
01:45:15,476 --> 01:45:19,413
All right, I'll wait
until you go to sleep, then.

1602
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:27,587
There's a lot of
good people out there.

1603
01:45:27,588 --> 01:45:29,356
But not many.

1604
01:45:32,693 --> 01:45:35,062
You want some more beans?

1605
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:44,971
You think little Margaret

1606
01:45:44,972 --> 01:45:50,543
is OK on that train
with 'em, uh, guthries?

1607
01:45:50,544 --> 01:45:54,380
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1608
01:45:54,381 --> 01:45:59,052
They was fine except adalyne

1609
01:45:59,053 --> 01:45:59,999
was kinda shot up real bad.

1610
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,454
Was kinda shot up real bad.

1611
01:46:01,455 --> 01:46:06,125
Uh, well, not that bad.

1612
01:46:06,126 --> 01:46:08,529
She just sorta was.

1613
01:46:11,765 --> 01:46:16,336
The way I had to come up
when I was a kid just...

1614
01:46:16,337 --> 01:46:19,072
Took the desire out of my heart

1615
01:46:19,073 --> 01:46:21,108
to ever have a little child.

1616
01:46:26,747 --> 01:46:29,315
And she was...

1617
01:46:29,316 --> 01:46:29,999
Born deaf, 'cause Satan
made her that way.

1618
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,185
Born deaf, 'cause Satan
made her that way.

1619
01:46:32,186 --> 01:46:34,487
I--I know that's what it
is, 'cause see,

1620
01:46:34,488 --> 01:46:36,756
I'm not supposed to ever
have anything I like.

1621
01:46:36,757 --> 01:46:40,326
I'm not just supposed to.

1622
01:46:40,327 --> 01:46:43,363
And...

1623
01:46:43,364 --> 01:46:45,632
And I...

1624
01:46:45,633 --> 01:46:48,134
I look at her sometime--

1625
01:46:48,135 --> 01:46:51,205
I look at her sometimes
and, uh...

1626
01:46:53,540 --> 01:46:55,475
I love her so much.

1627
01:46:55,476 --> 01:46:58,011
I love her so much
and I know I shouldn't.

1628
01:46:58,012 --> 01:46:59,999
I know I can't, I know
I won't, I know I...

1629
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:00,546
I know I can't, I know
I won't, I know I...

1630
01:47:00,547 --> 01:47:04,118
I just can't do it.
And--and then...

1631
01:47:15,262 --> 01:47:18,165
That's why she be born deaf.

1632
01:47:20,234 --> 01:47:22,302
And then I had
these mangled ideas.

1633
01:47:22,303 --> 01:47:28,141
I...I was gonna choke her.

1634
01:47:28,142 --> 01:47:29,999
And then--and then
I had that vision

1635
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,344
and then--and then
I had that vision

1636
01:47:31,345 --> 01:47:34,280
and I...

1637
01:47:34,281 --> 01:47:39,185
I talked to Jesus.

1638
01:47:39,186 --> 01:47:42,488
And he...

1639
01:47:42,489 --> 01:47:48,261
He laid my hand
to those bellows...

1640
01:47:48,262 --> 01:47:51,297
And we worked
the bellows together.

1641
01:47:51,298 --> 01:47:54,300
He and I.

1642
01:47:54,301 --> 01:47:58,104
And, and we, we worked 'em

1643
01:47:58,105 --> 01:47:59,999
and we worked 'em
and we worked 'em

1644
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,441
and we worked 'em
and we worked 'em

1645
01:48:01,442 --> 01:48:03,376
and we worked 'em
and we worked 'em

1646
01:48:03,377 --> 01:48:04,544
and we worked 'em
and we worked 'em

1647
01:48:04,545 --> 01:48:06,179
and worked 'em and worked 'em

1648
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:08,581
until the hellfire burned Satan

1649
01:48:08,582 --> 01:48:12,719
right out of me, ha ha ha!

1650
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:16,156
Ha ha ha!

1651
01:48:23,230 --> 01:48:24,631
What?

1652
01:48:31,005 --> 01:48:33,039
Hey!

1653
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:33,673
Whoa!

1654
01:48:33,674 --> 01:48:35,075
Aah!

1655
01:48:40,414 --> 01:48:41,615
Shit!

1656
01:48:53,694 --> 01:48:56,663
Arvid! Harvey!

1657
01:48:58,432 --> 01:48:59,499
Come on back here

1658
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:00,000
and let those bastards
bleed to death!

1659
01:49:00,001 --> 01:49:01,481
And let those bastards
bleed to death!

1660
01:49:10,611 --> 01:49:12,745
Evenin', Uncle jude.

1661
01:49:12,746 --> 01:49:14,147
Unh.

1662
01:49:14,148 --> 01:49:15,415
Arvid, Harvey!

1663
01:49:15,416 --> 01:49:17,418
Goddamn it, come back here!

1664
01:49:20,087 --> 01:49:22,588
I have to tell ya, val.

1665
01:49:22,589 --> 01:49:24,223
A whole range of emotion

1666
01:49:24,224 --> 01:49:26,359
rushed over me when I read

1667
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:28,495
that letter in those papers.

1668
01:49:30,097 --> 01:49:31,531
I was distraught for awhile

1669
01:49:31,532 --> 01:49:33,633
but then, God help me,

1670
01:49:33,634 --> 01:49:36,469
I was overwhelmed by
pride in you, boy.

1671
01:49:36,470 --> 01:49:38,471
At the thought of what you

1672
01:49:38,472 --> 01:49:39,739
must have carried yourself like

1673
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:40,673
down there in Cuba.

1674
01:49:40,674 --> 01:49:42,475
And the papers
must have been mistaken

1675
01:49:42,476 --> 01:49:44,977
because here you are.

1676
01:49:44,978 --> 01:49:46,112
Are you not?

1677
01:49:46,113 --> 01:49:48,648
Val, I was so scared when
that damned old government man

1678
01:49:48,649 --> 01:49:52,018
brought them papers
that told us you was dead.

1679
01:49:52,019 --> 01:49:54,187
I hope your rotten old tooth
still hurts!

1680
01:49:54,188 --> 01:49:55,521
Sissy, mind yourself.

1681
01:49:55,522 --> 01:49:56,489
Stop it!

1682
01:49:56,490 --> 01:49:59,526
Sissy, stop it!

1683
01:50:01,261 --> 01:50:03,329
Valentine doesn't
need to see you

1684
01:50:03,330 --> 01:50:05,031
behaving in this manner.

1685
01:50:05,032 --> 01:50:07,300
Besides, I have
things to talk about

1686
01:50:07,301 --> 01:50:09,502
much more important
than this love-sick

1687
01:50:09,503 --> 01:50:11,504
cow eyeing of yours.

1688
01:50:11,505 --> 01:50:13,673
Now, agent otts
was just doing his job

1689
01:50:13,674 --> 01:50:15,441
for the government.
He was a courier

1690
01:50:15,442 --> 01:50:18,010
of some mixed up information.

1691
01:50:18,011 --> 01:50:21,314
Now we're aware of that,
and it's all straight.

1692
01:50:21,315 --> 01:50:25,251
Just like val, here.

1693
01:50:25,252 --> 01:50:26,519
He took on the weight
of a marshal's badge.

1694
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:28,754
Now he's come here
with an enormous burden

1695
01:50:28,755 --> 01:50:29,999
because of that weight.
But it's mixed up, too

1696
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,524
because of that weight.
But it's mixed up, too

1697
01:50:31,525 --> 01:50:34,293
because he just
doesn't realize that

1698
01:50:34,294 --> 01:50:36,729
his obligation
to see justice done

1699
01:50:36,730 --> 01:50:39,398
can be overlooked
and forgiven to us

1700
01:50:39,399 --> 01:50:41,468
because we're his family.

1701
01:50:43,036 --> 01:50:45,004
The same rules of honor
don't apply to family

1702
01:50:45,005 --> 01:50:47,073
as they do
to the others out there

1703
01:50:47,074 --> 01:50:50,176
in this pagan world.

1704
01:50:50,177 --> 01:50:52,979
Now, I hope you
can open your heart

1705
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:57,550
to this simple truth, Valentine.

1706
01:50:57,551 --> 01:50:59,385
They shot three people
and killed two of 'em

1707
01:50:59,386 --> 01:50:59,999
in dunfries yesterday, leland.

1708
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,320
In dunfries yesterday, leland.

1709
01:51:01,321 --> 01:51:03,523
Oh, that's just temperance.

1710
01:51:03,524 --> 01:51:06,526
Temperance and restraint
at all times, val.

1711
01:51:06,527 --> 01:51:09,529
But alas, my boys have
fallen short once again.

1712
01:51:09,530 --> 01:51:11,731
I've come for you
and the boys, leland.

1713
01:51:11,732 --> 01:51:14,600
I thought you'd retired
from marshalin'.

1714
01:51:14,601 --> 01:51:16,269
Leland!

1715
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:20,072
Val's killed one of the twins!

1716
01:51:20,073 --> 01:51:21,742
Leland! He killed Harold!

1717
01:51:23,377 --> 01:51:24,477
Good evening, marshal.

1718
01:51:24,478 --> 01:51:26,179
If y'all ain't killed him yet,

1719
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:27,713
I wanna be the one to do it.

1720
01:51:27,714 --> 01:51:29,999
What in hell happened to you?

1721
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:30,450
What in hell happened to you?

1722
01:51:30,451 --> 01:51:32,318
He got his balls tore
nearly clean off

1723
01:51:32,319 --> 01:51:34,453
by some woman him
and arvid tried to have.

1724
01:51:34,454 --> 01:51:36,088
Well, him I can forgive

1725
01:51:36,089 --> 01:51:38,090
on the basis of pure "d" stupid.

1726
01:51:38,091 --> 01:51:40,560
But you? You oughta
have enough of this

1727
01:51:40,561 --> 01:51:42,995
took to your back
to lay a lick of sense

1728
01:51:42,996 --> 01:51:46,732
into that carnal-consumed
maggot mind.

1729
01:51:46,733 --> 01:51:49,702
Taylor, what the hell happened?

1730
01:51:49,703 --> 01:51:51,537
All you were supposed
to be doin'

1731
01:51:51,538 --> 01:51:54,307
was scouting over at the Wells.

1732
01:51:54,308 --> 01:51:55,174
Where were ya?

1733
01:51:55,175 --> 01:51:57,276
I took 'em.

1734
01:51:57,277 --> 01:51:59,999
We ran on something
I had going over in dunfries.

1735
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:00,480
We ran on something
I had going over in dunfries.

1736
01:52:00,481 --> 01:52:03,049
What something you had going on

1737
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:05,051
over in dunfries?

1738
01:52:05,052 --> 01:52:07,320
Since when have you
had something going on

1739
01:52:07,321 --> 01:52:09,388
anywhere without
telling me first?

1740
01:52:09,389 --> 01:52:12,258
And that's why val's
had to come down here,

1741
01:52:12,259 --> 01:52:17,231
looking for you and your
worm rot brain brothers.

1742
01:52:18,999 --> 01:52:19,765
I don't reckon you

1743
01:52:19,766 --> 01:52:21,300
can turn your nose up too high

1744
01:52:21,301 --> 01:52:23,337
to found money anymore...

1745
01:52:25,472 --> 01:52:28,307
Can you, daddy?

1746
01:52:28,308 --> 01:52:29,976
As far as val...

1747
01:52:29,977 --> 01:52:30,000
I don't really concern myself

1748
01:52:30,001 --> 01:52:32,178
I don't really concern myself

1749
01:52:32,179 --> 01:52:33,479
one way or the other

1750
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:37,050
with whatever the hell
he has to do.

1751
01:52:38,252 --> 01:52:40,119
Well, you'd best
concern yourself

1752
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:43,322
with what I have to
do because of you, boy.

1753
01:52:43,323 --> 01:52:44,590
Now I have to con him

1754
01:52:44,591 --> 01:52:46,759
from wanting to take us to jail

1755
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:49,095
and see through
some kind of trial.

1756
01:52:49,096 --> 01:52:50,998
Let me see if I'm clear on this.

1757
01:52:52,032 --> 01:52:57,069
You want me,
daddy, and everybody

1758
01:52:57,070 --> 01:52:59,999
to go back up there
and stand trial

1759
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,041
to go back up there
and stand trial

1760
01:53:02,042 --> 01:53:05,679
and be hung, right?

1761
01:53:09,182 --> 01:53:10,516
Now, that don't sound like much

1762
01:53:10,517 --> 01:53:11,717
of a decision to me, val.

1763
01:53:11,718 --> 01:53:15,121
You're either comin'
or goin', Taylor.

1764
01:53:15,122 --> 01:53:18,457
I don't really
care which anymore.

1765
01:53:18,458 --> 01:53:19,726
You choose.

1766
01:53:31,071 --> 01:53:32,171
Val!

1767
01:53:32,172 --> 01:53:34,273
Get away from there,
sissy, goddamn it,

1768
01:53:34,274 --> 01:53:36,009
or I'll shoot the--
Ow! Damn it!

1769
01:53:37,010 --> 01:53:40,980
Harvey, you put that pistol down

1770
01:53:40,981 --> 01:53:42,281
or I'm gonna come across there

1771
01:53:42,282 --> 01:53:44,450
and shoot you
with every goddamn gun

1772
01:53:44,451 --> 01:53:46,285
in this room, 'cause I'm having

1773
01:53:46,286 --> 01:53:48,721
to think real hard right now

1774
01:53:48,722 --> 01:53:51,524
about why the hell I
need the useless half

1775
01:53:51,525 --> 01:53:54,093
of a worthless set of twins.

1776
01:53:54,094 --> 01:53:57,463
None of ya are killing anybody.

1777
01:53:57,464 --> 01:53:59,999
I still decide
who dies around here

1778
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:00,000
and who don't.

1779
01:54:00,001 --> 01:54:02,101
And who don't.

1780
01:54:02,102 --> 01:54:05,438
Now, you two get
up off the damn floor

1781
01:54:05,439 --> 01:54:07,473
and take Valentine

01:54:15,515 --> 01:54:17,484
Hey, daddy.

1784
01:54:26,193 --> 01:54:27,728
You all heard daddy.

Daddy?

1790
01:54:37,204 --> 01:54:41,108
Daddy, daddy.

1791
01:54:41,708 --> 01:54:43,410
Daddy.

1792
01:54:45,712 --> 01:54:50,150
Daddy. Daddy!

1793

01:55:55,148 --> 01:55:58,417
Sissy, you gotta--
You gotta untie me, honey.

1812
01:55:58,418 --> 01:55:59,999
Do you love me, Valentine?

1813
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:00,653
Do you love me, Valentine?

1814
01:56:00,654 --> 01:56:02,121
What?

1815
01:56:02,122 --> 01:56:04,657
Do you love me, Valentine?

1816
01:56:04,658 --> 01:56:08,027
I've always had love
for you, sissy.

1817
01:56:08,028 --> 01:56:09,563
Untie me, sweetie.

1818
01:56:17,270 --> 01:56:18,537
What are you doin'?

1819
01:56:18,538 --> 01:56:20,172
What are you doin', sissy?

1820
01:56:20,173 --> 01:56:22,175
Well, I'm marryin' you.

1821
01:56:23,477 --> 01:56:26,046
Oh, honey, that's not how you
get married to somebody.

1822
01:56:27,013 --> 01:56:28,747
I love you, Valentine.

1823
01:56:28,748 --> 01:56:29,999
I need you to want me.

1824
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:30,250
I need you to want me.

1825
01:56:30,251 --> 01:56:32,351
I know I ain't worth much.

1826
01:56:32,352 --> 01:56:35,988
You're worth more than they
ever let you believe.

1827
01:56:35,989 --> 01:56:37,691
Just untie me, sweetie.

1828
01:56:39,593 --> 01:56:41,695
You'll go off with my brothers.

1829
01:56:43,029 --> 01:56:45,164
I wanna take 'em back
to stand trial, sissy.

1830
01:56:45,165 --> 01:56:47,500
Then I'll come back here
and help you

1831
01:56:47,501 --> 01:56:49,101
after I straighten things out.

1832
01:56:49,102 --> 01:56:51,570
You're gonna come back?

1833
01:56:51,571 --> 01:56:54,040
Yeah.

1834
01:56:57,177 --> 01:56:59,045
Hey, sissy!

1835
01:57:01,481 --> 01:57:03,717
What the hell are you
doin' over there?

1836
01:57:04,718 --> 01:57:06,051
You get up off him, sissy,

1837
01:57:06,052 --> 01:57:08,321
so I can kill him,
you damn whore.

1838
01:57:10,524 --> 01:57:11,991
Get off of him!

1839
01:57:11,992 --> 01:57:13,492
You shut up!
We're gettin' married.

1840
01:57:13,493 --> 01:57:15,528
You can't get married, sissy.

1841
01:57:15,529 --> 01:57:17,329
If that's all there was to it,

1842
01:57:17,330 --> 01:57:19,331
you'd already
be married to arvid.

1843
01:57:19,332 --> 01:57:20,733
Now get out of the way,

1844
01:57:20,734 --> 01:57:22,334
or I'm gonna blow
your ass off, too.

1845
01:57:22,335 --> 01:57:24,503
Goddamn you,

1846
01:57:24,504 --> 01:57:25,404
you get out of the way.

1847
01:57:25,405 --> 01:57:27,740
Ow! Goddamn.

1848
01:57:27,741 --> 01:57:29,676
Goddamn you!

1849
01:57:32,646 --> 01:57:33,746
I told you

1850
01:57:33,747 --> 01:57:35,214
to get out of the way.

1851
01:57:35,215 --> 01:57:36,749
Arvid, go see what that was.

1852
01:57:36,750 --> 01:57:38,651
Then bring Valentine
back out here

1853
01:57:38,652 --> 01:57:40,152
so I can kill him.

1854
01:57:40,153 --> 01:57:41,487
Bury him in that pit with daddy,

1855
01:57:41,488 --> 01:57:42,621
where he belongs.

1856
01:57:42,622 --> 01:57:46,492
Uncle jude, yelling:
In here! Arvid!

1857
01:57:46,493 --> 01:57:48,093
You heard me tell her!

1858
01:57:48,094 --> 01:57:49,461
Sissy?

1859
01:57:49,462 --> 01:57:50,496
Hey, sissy?

1860
01:57:50,497 --> 01:57:51,630
Ow!

1861
01:57:51,631 --> 01:57:54,067
Sissy? Hey, sissy?

1862
01:57:55,101 --> 01:57:57,603
Hey, sissy. Sissy, honey? Honey?

1863
01:57:57,604 --> 01:57:58,671

1864
01:57:58,672 --> 01:57:59,999
Hey, honey.

1865
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:00,140
Hey, honey.

1866
01:58:00,141 --> 01:58:01,707
I'll kill you,
you little son of a bitch!

1867
01:58:01,708 --> 01:58:03,475
Goddamn.

1868
01:58:03,476 --> 01:58:04,743
Come here!

1869
01:58:04,744 --> 01:58:08,080
Sissy, sissy, come here.

1870
01:58:08,081 --> 01:58:10,316
Come here. Sissy?

1871
01:58:10,317 --> 01:58:12,685
Sissy, sissy.

1872
01:58:12,686 --> 01:58:16,088
Arvid, she was in the barn

1873
01:58:16,089 --> 01:58:18,023

1874

No, wait up, arvid.

1877
01:58:25,565 --> 01:58:28,101
Ha ha! I shot

and take me back down there

1949
02:03:37,510 --> 02:03:39,444
to stand trial, don't you?

1950
02:03:39,445 --> 02:03:41,414
That's why I
came down here, Taylor.

1951
02:04:01,968 --> 02:04:04,504
Daddy would have
been real proud of you, val.

1952
02:04:05,638 --> 02:04:07,239
You know that even through

1953
02:04:07,240 --> 02:04:09,741
all this emotional
turmoil and bloodshed,

1954
02:04:09,742 --> 02:04:12,978
you maintained
your sense of purpose.

1955
02:04:12,979 --> 02:04:15,080
Well, Taylor,

1956
02:04:15,081 --> 02:04:16,748
I guess if you just
throw your guns down

1957
02:04:16,749 --> 02:04:18,550
and come on out here,

1958
02:04:18,551 --> 02:04:20,285
we'll ride back up to Los tragos

1959
02:04:20,286 --> 02:04:22,154
and see if we
can put a jury together.

1960
02:04:22,155 --> 02:04:24,489
That's a real comfort, val.

1961
02:04:24,490 --> 02:04:26,425
I sure wouldn't want
to go back up there

1962
02:04:26,426 --> 02:04:28,428
and stand trial without ya.

1963
02:04:29,395 --> 02:04:29,999
Oh, I surely wouldn't.

1964
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,064
Oh, I surely wouldn't.

1965
02:04:39,105 --> 02:04:40,707
You know an odd thing, val?

1966
02:04:42,275 --> 02:04:46,478
That government man
with the letter

1967
02:04:46,479 --> 02:04:48,481
about you bein' dead?

1968
02:04:50,283 --> 02:04:52,485
That's downright queer.

1969
02:04:55,355 --> 02:04:57,423
What do you make of that, val?

1970
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:02,527
I don't know if I'm certain

1971
02:05:02,528 --> 02:05:04,597
of my existence, Taylor.

1972
02:05:06,599 --> 02:05:09,167
Only my intentions.

1973
02:05:09,168 --> 02:05:10,502
Can you make it out here?

1974
02:05:10,503 --> 02:05:13,172
I don't know if I can.

1975
02:05:17,276 --> 02:05:19,678
I mean, I want to,

1976
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:22,215
but I'm hurt awful bad.

1977
02:05:23,549 --> 02:05:26,586
It's kinda hard for me
just to let things go.

1978
02:05:31,457 --> 02:05:33,593
It's all right, Taylor.

1979
02:05:41,234 --> 02:05:42,502
Ah...

1980
02:05:46,039 --> 02:05:48,608
I'll just come on
in there and get ya.

1981
02:06:15,968 --> 02:06:19,238
I truly admire your
sense of duty, marshal.

1982
02:06:42,128 --> 02:06:43,696
Come here, Taylor!

1983
02:06:47,467 --> 02:06:49,334
Goddamn it!

1984
02:06:49,335 --> 02:06:51,637
Damn it, val,
get the hell off me.

1985
02:07:50,429 --> 02:07:53,032
I figured you
to be dead, soldier.

1986
02:07:54,133 --> 02:07:56,034
Death has been all around me,

1987
02:07:56,035 --> 02:07:58,437
but it's yet
to take a hold of me.

1988
02:08:02,041 --> 02:08:03,475
Well, let's see if we're able

1989
02:08:03,476 --> 02:08:05,044
to walk among the living.

1990
02:08:22,195 --> 02:08:23,628
We'll probably be havin'

1991
02:08:23,629 --> 02:08:26,298
to eat it in San Francisco,

1992
02:08:26,299 --> 02:08:27,265
huh?

1993
02:08:27,266 --> 02:08:28,968
Chinese food.

1994
02:08:30,636 --> 02:08:33,638
Yeah, I guess.

1995
02:08:33,639 --> 02:08:36,174
Son of a gun.

1996
02:08:36,175 --> 02:08:37,410
You know something?

1997
02:08:39,345 --> 02:08:42,081
You're kind of an odd bird.
