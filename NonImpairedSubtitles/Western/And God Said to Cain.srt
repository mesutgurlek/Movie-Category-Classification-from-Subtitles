1
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,071
Gary!

2
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,153
Look. This is the liberation.

3
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,271
This is not the liberation
which I'm waiting for.

4
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,269
- I can imagine otherwise.
- Beware!

5
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,194
Gary Hamilton?

6
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,797
That's me.

7
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,198
Are you Gary Hamilton?
Lieutenant Gary Hamilton?

8
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,038
In view of the decree,

9
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,232
that the President issued regarding
the amnesty of political prisoners,

10
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,989
your extraordinary military
services during the war

11
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,669
and your exemplary conduct
in captivity,

12
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,553
was decided

13
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,788
to pardon you.

14
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,275
In view of the Decree
you are a free man.

15
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,870
Johnny! Come on, Johnny.

16
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,718
- What do I owe you?
- Nothing. This is on the house.

17
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,830
I ask the guards
an additional charge.

18
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,872
No. I have learned
that everything has its price.

19
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,635
How long were you there?

20
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,836
Ten years.

21
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,110
Let us go! It is a long way.

22
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,958
- Gee!
- Goodbye and good luck.

23
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,437
The heat is quite exhausting
after my stay in West Point.

24
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,391
Will you go back to the north?

25
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,556
Another year, and then I'm done.

26
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,670
Are you then an officer?

27
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,271
Yes. Then I will decide,
whether I continue or return.

28
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,118
- What would you prefer?
- I don't know.

29
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,517
If it were me, I would
look for a girl and get married.

30
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,314
- Who's stopping you?
- My father, I suppose.

31
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,352
He has big plans for me.

32
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,674
Are you from here?

33
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,396
My father owns all the gold mines
in the area. My name is Dick Acombar.

34
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,078
Did you just say Acombar?

35
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,874
- Do you know my father?
- Yes. I see him very often.

36
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,276
I meet him often in the market
in Tortonian City.

37
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,075
I did not know that he is married
and has such a great son.

38
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,430
My mother died when I was little.

39
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,879
Sorry.

40
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,318
Didn't you want to get off here?

41
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,230
Please tell your father,
that Gary Hamilton is back

42
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,589
and that I will visit him tonight.

43
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,629
- What was your name?
- Gary Hamilton.

44
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,874
Are you a friend of my father?

45
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,834
The man has forgotten his water bottle.

46
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,635
You can give it back tonight,
when he comes to visit.

47
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,197
What do you want?

48
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,430
I need a horse and a gun.

49
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,876
Isn't that enough?

50
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,469
This is the reward for ten years of
stone breaking.

51
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,356
For this dead presidents,
I can sell you Uragano, my mule.

52
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,870
But he is dear to my heart.
You can have Morello. He is good.

53
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,593
The other crocks are almost older than me.

54
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,553
It is said, that animals over the time
will be more similar to their owners.

55
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,195
My horses will falling out of teeth soon.

56
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,833
Here I have something fine for you.
A new model.

57
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,871
It shoots fast.

58
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,913
Pretty, isn't it?
What do you say?

59
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,590
Why were you so sure
that you can find me here?

60
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,270
In all the years the devil could get me.

61
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,719
For some things you wait in vain.

62
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,557
You say it.

63
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,279
Good shot! Super!

64
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,719
Now we will probably never know
the wind direction again.

65
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,116
That'll be sorry you
when he comes tonight.

66
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,997
A severe tornado is approaching.

67
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,754
When do you think it will arrive?

68
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,350
Before sunset.

69
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,274
I am not mistaken.

70
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:44,071
The years have passed,
but this crappy place remained.

71
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,954
Man toils hard
and builds up something

72
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,549
and then a tornado comes
and tears down everything.

73
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:59,033
In the last ten years, he swept
at least four times the entire city away.

74
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,594
You'll hardly recognize it.

75
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:07,636
Only the old gold mine and the
Indian Cemetery still look the same.

76
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,513
But no one goes out there anymore.

77
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,870
Only your house weathered out all  tornadoes.

78
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:21,076
- Does Acombar live there?
- Sure. Like a king in his palace.

79
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,116
You left it to him, including
furnishing and the harem.

80
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:34,595
I've seen a lot of whores,
but it is by far the worst.

81
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,153
What are you up to?

82
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,797
Going to town?

83
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,589
- I wait until the wind comes.
- This will be a hurricane.

84
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,997
Acombar expected a tornado
but not your return.

85
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,076
There will be a hot night.

86
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,759
Die!

87
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,118
Die!

88
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,079
Die!

89
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,869
Die!

90
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,640
You'll only make you enemies.

91
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,752
Kill!

92
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,072
Kill!

93
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,672
And then you will have the power.

94
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,951
I want the power for my son, Dick.

95
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,510
The stagecoach is coming!

96
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,230
Look at the old boy, Rosy!

97
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,592
Now your admirers even
bring their beds.

98
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,440
- Come on. We need two more.
- Do you do a brisk mattress feast today?

99
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,790
- Hurry up!
- I'm still going.

100
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,839
It was my idea.

101
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,749
We hide all the bottles
and cheat the tornado.

102
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,715
For me the house can fly off.
The bottles and I, we're safe.

103
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,592
- Take good care on them!
- Count on it.

104
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,754
How are you and your brothers, Jim?

105
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,473
Good. They are with your father.
Everybody is waiting for you.

106
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,748
My luggage!

107
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,473
- How are you, Dick?
- Well, and yourself?

108
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,238
Then, are we going?

109
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,872
See you soon, I hope.

110
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,833
If you go to the market with your father,
come visit us!

111
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,075
Goodbye, Mr. Acombar.

112
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,277
A conquest, or?

113
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,589
If it is something serious,
you only have to say,

114
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,270
and I and my brothers
will kidnap her for you.

115
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,508
And we will pave his way.

116
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,517
He faces a steep political career.

117
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,710
They will vote for him as senator.

118
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,277
Without opponents.

119
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,598
And through our relationships it is
just the beginning of his career.

120
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,318
Governor of the State and then ...

121
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,748
President of the United States.

122
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,549
Welcome home, my son!

123
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,558
I hope I will not disappoint you.

124
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,558
Even though I may not be that successful.

125
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,957
The army of Santa Maria is
entirely at your disposal.

126
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,069
Like the three musketeers!
At some point I'll be your D'Artagnan.

127
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,879
- Where's Mary?
- She's upstairs. Let us go.

128
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,393
Juanito!

129
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,191
- Welcome home!
- Juanito!

130
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,153
- Maria keeps free the most beautiful room for you.
- I'm looking forward.

131
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,599
- Welcome back, Dick.
- Thank you, Trick.

132
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,915
Come on, let's drink to it!

133
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,556
Dick! Welcome home.

134
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,831
You look great in that uniform.

135
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,796
He can hardly expect to take it off
and take a bath. Isn't it?

136
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,072
Yes. It is very hot.
I can hardly breathe.

137
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,998
It will cool down soon.

138
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,431
- A tornado is approaching.
- Do you remember two years ago?

139
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,359
The old say,
the tornado will be stronger today.

140
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,632
Well, where is our welcome drink?

141
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,079
Coming up.

142
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,794
- Have a drink with me?
- No, thanks.

143
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,114
- After the Bath.
- Good.

144
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,549
I accompany you upstairs.

145
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:08,232
Listen, this water bottle was left
by a man in the stagecoach.

146
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,989
He got off at the fork.
He said he would come tonight.

147
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,235
I think he is a friend of yours.

148
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,032
A friend of mine?

149
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,469
- Yes. His name is ...
- Señor.

150
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,548
Oh yes, his name is Gary Hamilton.

151
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,398
What's that?

152
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,032
Flocks of birds.

153
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,871
They are fleeing the tornado.

154
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,230
The animals feel it and avoid it.

155
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,033
Give him the bottle back,
when he comes.

156
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,998
Accompany me?

157
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,031
Of course.

158
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,832
Let's go.

159
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,198
I recognize it, it is his.

160
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,312
We put it into the coach back then,
attach it to him.

161
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,952
Shut up!

162
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,550
I will not hear of it.

163
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,153
If he really should come,
we will receive him properly.

164
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,556
But he mustn't get a foot in here alive.

165
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,034
This is also in your interest.

166
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,470
My son may not know about it,
understand?

167
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,073
You can count on us.

168
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,759
Gather the men at the entrance to the city!

169
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,433
- Do you think that he has fled?
- That doesn't matter now.

170
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,037
- You must stop him.
- What do you mean with 'stop'?

171
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,877
You've already understood.

172
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,315
He must be stopped. For ever.

173
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,351
This man must die.

174
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,719
Get out!

175
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,911
A mind that returns,

176
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,232
can only have one wish.

177
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,078
He can only aspire one thing.
Revenge.

178
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,515
- Are you afraid?
- No.

179
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,752
But your son has a suspicion,  indeed.

180
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,155
He asked me if I know him.

181
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,311
What did you answer him?

182
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,279
I said that I do not know him,
I have never heard his name.

183
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,677
Maybe I told the truth.

184
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,475
In reality I had no time
to get to know him properly.

185
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,393
I only had the time
to deceive him.

186
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,709
You do not know him, understand?

187
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,036
Dick must know nothing of it
and he also will not.

188
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,516
Gary Hamilton will never set a foot
in this house in alive.

189
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,317
Whoever they expect to come,
I wouldn't like to be in his shoes.

190
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,157
What do you think, Judge?

191
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,116
- Where are you going, children?
- Hi, Uncle Jonathan.

192
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,995
Is it true that the great
wind comes tonight?

193
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,871
Yes, a fairly strong wind.

194
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,717
Don't peer out the window.

195
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:00,199
The tonights wind could even
bring dangerous lead.

196
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,672
- No, stop it
- No, my little one.

197
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,349
The uncle can't see without his glasses.

198
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,748
- Go home! The storm begins.
- Come on, kids.

199
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,078
- Send them to bed at once, Jane.
- You should also go home.

200
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,079
Acombar apparently tries
to chase the tornado away.

201
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,876
Where is this guy?

202
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,792
Are you crazy, you idiot?

203
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,599
Come on, people! Come all with me!

204
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,872
Back in the city before we even
shoot each other. Go!

205
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,717
Catch that horse!

206
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,550
- Let's search for the horse.
- Go!

207
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,870
He couldn't have dissolved.

208
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,674
We search the houses.
You catch the horse.


209
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,312
Come on!

210
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,834
Is it true that Acombar
will pay a bounty?

211
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,873
Yes, a very high bounty.
But first he must be found.

212
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,912
For whom do you seek?

213
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,111
That's none of yours, old boy.
Go home!

214
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,199
Got it?

215
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,917
Damned wind!

216
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,394
He is certainly not here.

217
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,351
Let's go!

218
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,597
If we continue to look so aimlessly,
we'll never find him.

219
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,631
So much for $ 10,000 bounty.

220
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,235
- That would be something!
- This way, Amigos!

221
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,832
What's up?

222
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,230
- Why did the father rings the bell
- It is not the father.

223
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,592
He has locked the door earlier
and tied the bell.

224
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,835
Someone must have loosened them.

225
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,311
This doesn't please me.

226
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,830
Enough!
It's enough to drive you mad!

227
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,757
Now I feel better.

228
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,957
You're a new man!

229
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,798
What is going on tonight?

230
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,071
The wind must have
broken loose the bell-rope.

231
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,348
And the shot?

232
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,197
Probably a drunk, trying
to drive out the tornado.

233
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,310
Let's drink to your return.

234
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,598
- Mary, don't you drink with us?
- No.

235
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,635
My brother!

236
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,998
He's dead.

237
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,755
Who has rung the bell?

238
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,229
We need to find him.
Do you now believe that he's no ghost?

239
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,271
I'm going to Acombar.

240
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,079
I stay around here.

241
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,871
I killed him, father.

242
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:45,634
Father. How stupid, to name a man father,
who is younger than oneself.

243
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,153
Just as it is stupid to speak to someone,
who asks God for forgiveness.

244
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,430
But Gary Hamilton's lifelong conviction
sticks in his blood.

245
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:03,790
Innocent.
You have sentenced me to such a life.

246
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:09,197
The life and the world
have no meaning for me, anymore.

247
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,598
For me, I only count on my revenge.
He is dead.

248
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,029
His brothers will be next.

249
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,431
And finally Acombar.

250
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,396
I have waited ten years
for my revenge.

251
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:35,036
If one may punish an innocent man,
then I may kill, too.

252
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:45,631
Even if God will tell me the same thing
he said to Cain.

253
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:57,356
This pig has managed
to come into the city.

254
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,916
- He killed Jim.
- You let yourselves fooled by him.

255
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:06,112
You have more than thirty men.
You need to find him.

256
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,029
Who has rung the bell?

257
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,435
- He, I suppose.
- Aren't hungry?

258
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,438
- The table is set.
- I'll be right there.

259
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,912
You'll go over there.

260
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,671
Apparently many drunks are
on the road, tonight.

261
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,030
Do you still want a bit of these?

262
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,632
Over there! Quick!

263
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,912
Gary, I knew it is you!

264
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,317
I've been expecting you.
I'm still your friend.

265
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:34,275
When I saw the horse, I knew you
have hidden in the old Indian Cemetery.

266
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,756
None of Acombar's men
dares to go there,

267
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,791
not even for gold.

268
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,875
An Indian has previously attempted.

269
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,038
Luckily I still have a good ear
and good reflexes.

270
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,798
And a good gun.

271
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:54,073
It wasn't neccessary in the past,
but now, things have changed.

272
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,878
People are afraid of Acombar.

273
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:04,277
Only Rosy from the Saloon let not bully herself.
But she also had to pay.

274
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:08,757
They killed her husband
and make it look like an accident.

275
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,311
- And the judge?
- The judge?

276
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:16,638
He is one of the first
of which were corrupted.

277
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,589
- For him, everything looks like an accident.
- What happened to your leg?

278
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,394
- A gift of Francisco Santa Maria.
- Also an accident?

279
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:30,037
Sure. If I wanted to live,
I had to tell it was an accident.

280
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,832
And you?

281
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,916
A long vacation
with lots of sun and snakes.

282
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,036
But that's over now.

283
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,469
Stay here and do not stir from the spot.

284
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,836
Pedro! Quick!

285
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,751
We put him in the saloon.

286
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,191
Help me, Carlos!

287
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,236
Put him on the floor.

288
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,952
If it's true
that you were formerly a doctor,

289
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,195
then you have to help him.

290
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,515
This man mustn't die.

291
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:30,758
It wasn't Gary Hamilton.
It was a monster.

292
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,870
From hell.

293
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,718
Pedro, you mustn't die.

294
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,558
You mustn't die! No!

295
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,871
I choose my victims.

296
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,875
I need whiskey for my men!

297
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,268
Now  it's time to overcome
this senseless fear.

298
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,273
He's not a monster, but a coward,

299
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,550
I would like to get my hands on.

300
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,079
I will find him.

301
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,272
Spread these!

302
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,995
Take also these!

303
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,352
Do you want money?

304
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,517
Do you think Acombar hasn't the money

305
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,994
for these few bottles?

306
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,793
Give them back!
It is only raspberry juice.

307
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,159
Right.

308
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,918
It's raspberry juice.

309
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,554
If it's Gary, you are looking for,
he now has one less enemy.

310
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,909
Let them shoot me by all means.

311
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,559
Catch it!

312
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,238
Here!

313
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,270
What does Gary Hamilton want from you?

314
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,677
Is he in there?

315
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,877
Get the bell down!
I can not hear them, anymore.

316
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,437
Who rang the bell this time?

317
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,712
So, Father ...

318
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,670
Who has rung the bell?

319
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,199
Answer me!

320
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,276
I will avenge you, Miguel.

321
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,999
Let us go!

322
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,950
Get the bell down, at last!

323
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,554
- Are you up there, Chico?
- Yes.

324
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,876
Untie it and let it fall!

325
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,917
Do you understand?

326
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:07,791
Let it fall!

327
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,194
Out of my way!

328
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:28,672
Let's go.

329
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,199
To the villa.

330
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,513
Come on!

331
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,396
I have searched for you.

332
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,192
Why this carnage?

333
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,797
Why do you hate my father?
You want to kill him, right?

334
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,228
Yes.

335
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:25,798
You don't need to fear,
I'm unarmed.


336
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:34,111
I only want to talk to you.

337
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,597
I would like to know the truth.

338
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:02,630
I know I haven't listened to you.
I want to help you.

339
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:06,036
Even if it is only with this old rifle.

340
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,953
Caution!

341
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,991
This is the son of Acombar.

342
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,637
We traveled together.

343
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,391
He sat with me in the stagecoach.

344
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,271
He wants to know the truth.

345
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:30,549
The truth about his father.

346
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,397
You can tell a thing or two about it.

347
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:36,672
But you must be prepared to hear everything.

348
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,678
Until the end.

349
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,031
Yes, I must know it.

350
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,552
Have you seen Dick?

351
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:07,993
Where's Dick?

352
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,076
Wasn't he with you?

353
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:14,875
- He followed you when you left.
- And you gave permission?

354
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,831
You should have had to hold him back!

355
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,996
I have to protect Dick.

356
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,600
He has nothing to do
with the whole story.

357
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:24,837
If something happens to him,
you will pay for it.

358
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,477
Let the paperwork
and get you a gun!

359
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,478
Dick is on his way to the city.

360
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,557
- Get the men!
- Come on! The horse cart must be out of the way!

361
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:05,199
Take the horses into the other shed!
This one could collapse.

362
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:22,832
There he is.

363
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,630
Are you crazy, just to slip away?

364
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:36,193
Come on!

365
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:38,549
We go home.

366
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,712
Frank, we go home.

367
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:44,469
The men should come into the villa.
Only three or four remain here.

368
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,953
They're gone.

369
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,589
The boy did not betray you.

370
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,596
I don't trust him anyway.

371
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,148
Quickly, it could collapse.

372
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:09,714
- Why did you leave the house?
- I wanted to talk to Hamilton.

373
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,318
Go! Move!

374
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:18,118
- Bring the horses to safety!
- Go on!

375
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,672
The street is empty.

376
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:28,280
They are certainly all in the villa.

377
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:32,194
If Dick should talk ...

378
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:35,550
After all, what they did to you,
are you still so naive.


379
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,828
Why?

380
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,155
I wouldn't have told the boy that much.

381
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:43,273
His father would have skinned
your son alive.

382
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:44,639
No.

383
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:48,514
A son should not pay for
his father's mistakes.

384
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,079
Mary is also in the villa.

385
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,792
I know.

386
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,034
Here!

387
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:39,676
No, I rather keep mine.
It has always brought me luck.

388
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,717
Hey, look!

389
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,751
Someone runs to the villa.

390
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:00,037
- Where is he?
- Here.

391
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:25,232
Come on!

392
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,398
Come on!

393
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,878
Look around!

394
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,873
View all exactly!

395
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,394
Here.

396
01:14:56,440 --> 01:15:00,513
This here is what Gary Hamilton is keen on.

397
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,197
Look at that.

398
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,119
This gold belongs to you alone.

399
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:15,311
Only to you.

400
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,873
Do you understand?

401
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:26,629
With gold one can coin money.

402
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:36,109
The only thing that counts these days,
believe me,

403
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:37,639
is money.

404
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:44,390
Do you have a different opinion?

405
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,675
Isn't it?

406
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:50,837
Do you prefer to live in the dirt,

407
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,871
like me during my youth?

408
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,270
I do not agree with you.

409
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:04,230
Does that mean you renounce all that?

410
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,798
I spoked to him.

411
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,512
I know the truth.

412
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:15,118
The truth ...

413
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:18,630
Here is a fortune
and you talk about truth?

414
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:21,592
What truth?
That's the truth.

415
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,516
We rather should divide us.

416
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,915
Then one of us will make it at least.

417
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,155
Hopefully you.
Good luck.

418
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,675
- What did he told you?
- Everything.


419
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:15,029
And that would be?

420
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,356
He said,
that the war wasn't over yet,


421
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,915
when you have attacked the
gold transporter of the Confederates.

422
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:24,394
You have massacred them

423
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,159
and blamed it to him.

424
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,595
He had an alibi.

425
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:34,989
He was in this house,
that belonged to him at that time.

426
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:38,237
He was here with his wife,
but you ...

427
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,316
You have persuaded Mary.

428
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:45,438
She stabbed him in the back.

429
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:47,471
She has lied shamelessly.

430
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,554
Now I know,
why he wants to kill you.

431
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:55,149
I also know that we must stop him
before he destroys you.

432
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:58,397
I am your son
and must be on your side,

433
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,759
even if ...

434
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:03,989
I'm becoming a murderer like you,
when killing an innocent man.

435
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:51,995
Stop!

436
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,960
Frank, why?

437
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,036
Because Gary is innocent.

438
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,638
You know that exactly.

439
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:05,592
Idiot!
I have had hit him for sure.

440
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,032
No one will stop him.

441
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:30,551
No, Gary.

442
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:40,399
No.

443
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,511
Oh Gary.

444
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:52,076
Gary, forgive me!

445
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,391
For what I did to you!

446
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,351
I was forced to, believe me!

447
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:00,153
They would have killed me, you know?
I was afraid.

448
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:07,032
I was foolish and stupid,
but I was afraid.

449
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,037
That were years of hell for me, too.

450
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:17,590
He has captived me.
I have never loved him.

451
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:11,913
Bring me to him.

452
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,558
He's here! Gary Hamilton is here.
He will kill us.

453
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,160
- Be quiet!
- He will kill us!

454
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,672
Caution!

455
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:39,958
My son!

456
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,359
Why?

457
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:52,389
Why?

458
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,956
It is solely your fault.

459
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:30,513
You know what will happen now.
You killed him!

460
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,349
- No!
- Yes, you did!

461
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:44,075
I warned you,
if something happens to him,

462
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:47,112
- you have to pay for it.
- No.

463
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:52,149
No.

464
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,991
Now you also gonna die.

465
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:58,628
No.

466
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:05,237
This way!
He's over there! Stop him!

467
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:16,559
Where are you?


468
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,069
I'm here.


469
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:25,869
Where?

470
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,036
Show yourself!
Where are you?

471
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,351
Where are you?


472
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,558
Where are you?


473
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:37,713
Where are you?


474
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:44,117
Where?

475
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:45,309
Where?

476
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:54,277
Hamilton, show yourself!

477
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:06,636
Show yourself!
Stop hiding!

478
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,433
I am here, Acombar.

479
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:38,954
Here.

480
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,309
I'm standing right in front of you.

481
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:32,271
No! No!

482
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:03,631
Dig,
under the rubble you will find enough gold

483
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,671
to rebuild everything.
