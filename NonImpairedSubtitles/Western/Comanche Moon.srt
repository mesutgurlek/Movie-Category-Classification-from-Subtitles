00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,700
The Comanche and the whites have
been at war since the early 1800s.

10
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,700
The Texas Rangers were formed
as a volunteer troop in order
to contain the Comanche.

11
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Northwest Texas 1858

12
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,900
There's a lot of Indians
down there, Captain Scull.

13
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Well, don't be tempted
by them, Mr. Call.

14
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,900
They're the wrong Indians.

15
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,500
I've never been thwarted
in the pursuit

16
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,700
of a felonious foe, and I don't
intend to be this time.

17
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,000
That's Buffalo Hump

18
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,500
and his band, gentlemen.

19
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,900
And the felonious foe I want

20
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,500
is that horse-stealing
Kicking Wolf.

21
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,200
I wouldn't be foolish enough

22
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,800
to take on Buffalo Hump's whole
camp with just ten men, Captain.

23
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,300
Captain's never been
run off from,

24
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,800
and Kicking Wolf's
never been caught.

25
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,700
Who would you bet against if
you had to wager, Woodrow--

26
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,000
Captain Scull or Kicking Wolf?

27
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,500
I wouldn't bet
against the captain

28
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,900
even if I thought
he was wrong, Gus.

29
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,900
He's the captain.

30
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,900
Hell, I'd bet against
him in a minute.

31
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,500
Hey.
Huh?

32
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,700
It's heading toward night.

33
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,900
Ain't we gonna camp and
brew us up some coffee?

34
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,000
Do you see a campfire?

35
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,800
You see any coffee, sir?

36
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,200
No.

37
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,600
And don't you be "sirin'"
me, you durn yapper.

38
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,000
You two can argue
some other tim

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Let's go.

40
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,600
I consider you
a lucky man, Woodrow.

41
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,400
You'll probably be
long married before I am.

42
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,400
You'll never be married,
unless you give up on Clara.

43
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,000
She don't mean

44
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,900
to marry you, and that's that.

45
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,600
Well, if you knew
anything about women,

46
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,800
you'd know they change
their minds ever day.

47
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
You would've made a good
Indian, Woodrow.

48
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,700
You got no use
for the settled life.

49
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,400
I got no use
for idle palaver,

50
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,700
if that's what you mean.

51
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,100
I'd rather listen
to a hoot owl hoot

52
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
than listen to you
think up insults.

53
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,300
Call is with Big Horse Scull.

54
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,900
And the other one is there.McCrae.

55
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,200
They are chasing Kicking Wolf.

56
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,800
He stole many of their horses.

57
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Call killed your brother.

58
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,900
You kill him.

59
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,100
I gave him to you.

60
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,000
Why are you standing there?

61
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,800
Augustus!

62
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,200
Cut him off!

63
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,800
I'll ride him down, the scamp!

64
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,800
Bible and sword!

65
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,500
Aha.

66
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,700
That's him, gentlemen.

67
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,500
That's Buffalo Hump.

68
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,300
Bible and sword.

69
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,900
It's not every day you get to
Bualo Hu at breakfas

70
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,100
???

71
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,300
NThat young cub we were chasing
u'd nt is talking to him.

72
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,400
I expect it's his son,
Blue Duck.

73
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,300
He has a Mexican look about him.

74
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Probably a child of a captive.

75
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,800
He just looked right at me.

76
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,200
Let me look.

77
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,600
He almost got me once,
the devil.

78
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,700
He's older, but he
ain't dead, Woodrow.

79
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,800
SCULL:
Those torturing fiends

80
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,500
down there are theest,
most capable

81
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,100
opponents
I've ever faced.

82
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,600
And I mean
to kill them

83
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,700
to the last man.

84
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,700
But when it's done, mm...

85
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,500
by God, I'll miss them.

86
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,100
You'll miss them, sir?

87
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,700
I'm a fighting man, Mr. McCrae.

88
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,400
And fighting men need other
fighting men to fight.

89
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,300
Well, we're
a tempting morsel,

90
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,500
sitting up here

91
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,900
on top of this hole.

92
00:08:59,996 --> 00:09:02,212


93
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,300
We better make ourselves
morsels in motion then.

94
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,400
Why, Miss Tilton,
so good to see you.

95
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,100
And you, too, Miss Forsythe.

96
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,900
Mother, this is
Miss Maggie Tilton.

97
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
Maggie, this
is my mother.

98
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,600
Please to meet you,
Mrs. Forsythe.

99
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,200
Why, and you, Miss Tilton.

100
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,300
We just got these
cups and plates in

101
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,900
from Pennsylvania.

102
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,500
I think they're
the very thing,

103
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,400
but Pa thinks
they're too fancy.

104
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,200
What do you think?

105
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,100
Oh...

106
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,300
they're so elegant.

107
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,900
But I have to try not
to look too hard

108
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,200
at things I can't afford.

109
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,900
How I wish we were sisters.

110
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,600
Oh, Miss Forsythe.

111
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,800
Thank you.

112
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,000
I doubt I've
ever received

113
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,400
a finer compliment.

114
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,500
Well, I mean it.

115
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,900
We were sisters, you could
help me reason with Pa

116
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,200
when he has a fit and decides
I'm trng to drive him to ruin

117
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,800
just by ordering
pretty crockery.

118
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,100
Why, Staffordshire
plates.

119
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,800
I'll have them all.

120
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,900
And the cups, too.

121
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,900
Though they are
rather plain.

122
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,800
Mrs. Scull,
I haven't yet

123
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,800
finished inventorying
the shipment.

124
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
There's more than
100 pieces.

125
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,900
Are you sure
you want them all?

126
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,000
You must recall I run
a mansion, Miss Forsythe.

127
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,500
So box them back up and
I'll send a servant for them.

128
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,700
What the negroes
don't break,

129
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
I can throw at Inish next time he drips tobacco juice


130
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,800
on my fine table cloth.

131
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,800
Haven't seen you riding lately,
Madam Scull.

132
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,200
Oh, the quirts
aren't for my horses.

133
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,900
They're for my negroes.

134
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,400
Good day, Miss Forsythe.

135
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
I can't seem to keep
track of my thimbles

136
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
for some reason.

137
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,400
Well, thimbles
I can supply.

138
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,200
If it was news of those

139
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,600
wild ranger boys
you were hoping for,

140
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,200
I'm bound to disappoint you.

141
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,400
Suppose they're still
up on the plains

142
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,400
chasing Comanche
horse thieves,

143
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,800
freezing their ears off.

144
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,900
Yes, it's been
sharp weather.

145
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,800
I expect they're cold.

146
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,300
Miss Tilton...

147
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,600
I'd be pleased
if you call me Clara.

148
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,500
I wish Captain Scull would
just give up on Kicking Wolf.

149
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,000
I'd like to hightail it
back to Austin, see Clara.

150
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,300
I'd like to sneak into Buffalo
Hump's camp and kill him.

151
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,700
That's my thinking.

152
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,000
We'll have to fight him
sooner or later anyway.

153
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,900
See now, that's the difference
between me and you, Woodrow.

154
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,100
I mostly think about love,
you mostly think about war.

155
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,400
Yeah.

156
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,100
If he don't stop soon,

157
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm gonna dismount
right here and die.

158
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,700
I'm so cold and tired,

159
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,100
can't tell up from down.

160
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
I'm gonna have
to quit rangering

161
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,900
if I have to spend
too much time

162
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,600
in a place where I can't
tell up from down.

163
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,000
Quit and do what?

164
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,700
All you know how to do is
ride horses and shoot guns.

165
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,800
 you quit rangering,
you'd starve.

166
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,700
Now, that's a rash
statement, Woodrow.

167
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,600
There he is,
the raal.

168
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,000
He ain't a rascal,
he's our scout.

169
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,800
Oh, what good's
a scout who goes off

170
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,500
and doesn't report
but every three days?

171
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,500
Hey, what got him
so riled?

172
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,700
Besides that,
he beat me at cards.

173
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,400
You must've swallowed
a badger, Gus.

174
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,400
I swear you're
surly today.

175
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
Shut up.

176
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,300
Where's Captain off
to in such a hurry?

177
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,600
He's going to the place where
Kicking Wolf and his warriors

178
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,700
butchered most
of the stolen horses.

179
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,700
Kicking Wolf only wanted
the three stallions.

180
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,000
Any meat left?
Yes.

181
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,900
Maybe the captain'll let
Deets cook us up a bunch.

182
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
Ain't you coming?

183
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
No.

184
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm going to see
my grandmother.

185
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,400
She's old.

186
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,200
She may want to tell me
a few more stories

187
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,700
before she dies.

188
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,400
Well, how are we supposed
to catch Kicking Wolf

189
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,900
without you to track?

190
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,900
Kicking Wolf is much too quick
for Big Horse Scull

191
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,000
to catch.

192
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,000
Scull might as well go home.

193
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,900
And let a horse thief
get clean away?

194
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,300
That's not the captain's habit.

195
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,600
Kicking Wolf
is the best

196
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,000
horse thief in the world.

197
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,200
Is Big Horse Scull
the best captain in the world?

198
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,600
Scull Mansion
Austin,Texas

199
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,000
How come you did not go
with the captain, Jake?

200
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,300
The captain wanted me
to stay here in Austin.

201
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,700
Yeah, take care of the place
till he gets back.

202
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,400
But he said I can
go next time, so...

203
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,900
Hey, Felice, what
happened to you?

204
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,700
The missus.

205
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,500
The missus?

206
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,100
What, did you drop a plate?

207
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,500
Did you sass Madam Scull?

208
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,600
I didn't sass her.

209
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,400
I didn't drop no plate.

210
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,600
If you don't hurry
with that buttermilk,

211
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,800
Felice,

212
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,500
you'll get the quirting
of your life.

213
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,400
Don't interfere th
r slaves, Spoon.

214
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,600
Madam would like
to see you upstairs.

215
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,000
And you're late
as it is.

216
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,700
What am I late for?

217
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,700
If the madam says you're
late, you are late.

218
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,300
She wants help
with the drapes.

219
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,400
Now go.

220
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,600
Scat, you old possum!

221
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,300
uh, Butler said you needed help
with your drapes.

222
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,300
I suppose he meant...

223
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,500
I wanted you to undrape me.

224
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,700
Uh, what, ma'am?

225
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,500
"Come to my parlor,"

226
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,100
said the spider

227
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,100
to the fly.

228
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,300
Well, uh, wh...

229
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,800
what, uh, ma'am, uh...

230
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,600
Don't utter, Jakey.

231
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,800
Such lovely hair.

232
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,300
Ought to win you
many female hearts.

233
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,600
Come a little closer so I
can see your dimples better.

234
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,500
Well... I was just, uh...

235
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,900
supposed to trim the mare's
feet this afternoon.

236
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,400
I can't allow it.

237
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Not today.

238
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,300
I should really...

239
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,100
Miss Scull...

240
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,200
I better...

241
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,100
What are you doing here?

242
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,600
Your white friends are gone.

243
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,700
Your son made me come.

244
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,600
He said you might want to torture
me for a while.

245
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,100
If you come into my camp.

246
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,100
I would hang you upside-down.

247
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,100
and put a scorpion in your nose.

248
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,900
I don't like Kickapoos.

249
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,100
This man has my protection.

250
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Why did you interfere with him?

251
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,500
Because he's a stinking Kickapoo.

252
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,200
And he led the Rangers to us.

253
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,200
You should have brought me
Call's scalp.

254
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,500
Instead you defy me.

255
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,800
My horse.

256
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,100
I'm tired of ordinary horses.

257
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,600
Most horses are ordinary,Kicking Wolf.

258
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,200
The Buffalo Horse is not ordinary.

259
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,200
He is the most famous horse in the world.

260
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,800
That's a fine tracker.

261
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,200
He may be a fine tracker,

262
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,100
but I fail to see
that he's ours.

263
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,200
Mostly seems to track
for himself.

264
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,200
Well, that's just research,
Mr. McCrae.

265
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,200
The man is said to know
every creek

266
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,400
in between the Rio Grande
and the Columbia River Gorge.

267
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,300
Takes a lot of private tracking
to build that much knowledge.

268
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,400
I was in Buffalo Hump's camp.

269
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,900
His son Blue Duck took me
prisoner for a while.

270
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,900
But Buffalo Hump won't let
anyone kill me.

271
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,800
Well, that's new.
Why not?

272
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,000
I helped his grandmother
with her dying.

273
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,100
Kicking Wolf is following you.

274
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,700
Three Birds is with him.

275
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,300
Well, that's original.

276
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,200
First we follow him,
then he follows us.

277
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,400
Well, if it's just two of them,
let's go kill them.

278
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,000
At least that'll stop hihorse
stealing for a while.

279
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,500
You can't catch them.

280
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,200
They have better horses
than you.

281
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,800
If you try
to chase them,

282
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,900
they'll lead you
so far away,

283
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,500
you'll starve before
you can find your way back.

284
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,500
Well, I been out there before
and I didn't starve.

285
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,800
Here now, men,

286
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,300
I won't send you out
chasing a phantom

287
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,800
in country this spare.

288
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,700
We'll post a double guard
tonight.

289
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,400
Let's move.

290
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,200
That horse might be a witch.

291
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,200
Some sat it can fly.

292
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,800
It is too cold for the whites.

293
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,800
They're weak,and careless with
their horses.

294
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,100
Sheer,
absolu genius.

295
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,300
Stealing horses
is one thing,

296
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,800
but stealing Hector--
that's absolute genius!

297
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,000
It's still just
a horse thief
stealin' a horse.

298
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,200
We ought to be
chasing him

299
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,700
instead of standing around
talking about it.

300
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,500
Well, we been chasing
him for ten years now

301
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,800
and we ain't
caught him yet.

302
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,000
MCCRAE:
I'd like to see you go
into Buffalo Hump's camp

303
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,400
and steal one of
his horses.

304
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,000
Well, I don't claim
to be a horse thief.

305
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,000
And we can't catch him,
'cause we stop to sleep
at night and he don't.

306
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,700
What is a genius, anyway?

307
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,500
Aw, I guess
the captain's a genius.

308
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,600
You ought to ask him.

309
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,700
A genius is somebody
with six toes on one foot.

310
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,200
Well, I mean, at's
what I heard, anyway.

311
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,200
A genius ain't
got no warts.

312
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,900
MCCRAE:
Well, in that case, Ikey,

313
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,300
I'm a genius,

314
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,400
'cause I'm  rarely
troubled with warts.

315
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,500
I hear a genius
is desperate smart.

316
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,600
He's right. 

317
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,000
I met one, once,
up in St. Louis.

318
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,800
And he could
spell words backwards,

319
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,800
and even say numbers
backwards, too.

320
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,600
Well, what's the point
of spelling backward

321
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,100
You spell backwards, you
wouldn't have much of a word.

322
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,600
Pig.

323
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,300
I wish we had us
a good ol' fat pig.

324
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,500
Quiet, now, Lee.

325
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,300
No one was
discussingwine.

326
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,400
No one was discussing
much of anything.

327
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Lee's got as much right
to talk as you have.

328
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,700
All right, Captain's coming.
We'll soon have our orders.

329
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,300
Firearms... slicker.
Slicker!

330
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,900
Need to be
traveling light.

331
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,300
Sir.
Thank you.

332
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,900
A man should be able to go
from Cape Cod to California

333
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,900
with no more gear than this.

334
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,700
And if he can't, he deserves
to die where he drops, I say.

335
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,700
CALL:
Sir, the Comanches
know where we are.

336
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,300
You'll get scalped,
for sure.

337
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,200
Or freeze to death.

338
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,600
With all respe, Captain,

339
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,700
why on earth would you
strike out on foot?

340
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,900
The tragedy of man, gentlemen,
is not death or epidemic

341
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:03,100
or lust or rage
or even scalping, Mr. Call.

342
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,000
No, sir, the tragedy
of man is boredom.

343
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,300
Boredom!

344
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,400
A man can only do a given thing

345
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,200
so many times with
freshness and spirit,

346
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,400
and then, no matter
how lively the sport,

347
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,300
it becomes a bore.

348
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,600
Now, I love cards and whoring,

349
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,700
but even cards and whoring,
after awhile, become boresome.

350
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,800
You can top your wife
a thousand times,

351
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,900
and that becomes tedioustoo.

352
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,400
Sir, I don't see
what this has to do

353
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,600
with you just walking off
and leaving us.

354
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,500
Well, opportunity, Mr. Call.

355
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,700
Opportunity and adversity
are kissing cousins.

356
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,400
So, we'll be leaving you now,
gentlemen.

357
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,900
Famous Shoes is going
to teach me how to track

358
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,700
while he follows my horse.

359
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,300
But, Captain,
what about us?

360
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,000
What could be simpler?
Go home.

361
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Mr. McCrae, Mr. Call, I'm
making you co-commanders.

362
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,300
See these fine gentlemen
get home to Austin

363
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,700
and see that they get
paid right away.

364
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,100
So we're just
to go home, then.

365
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,500
Yes. Home.

366
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,600
If you encounter
any rank bandits

367
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,400
alonthe way, hg them.

368
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,400
Otherwise, report
to the governor

369
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,300
and get drunk till I show up.

370
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,600
Well, what do we tell
Mrs. Scull?

371
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,200
Oh, Inez is my 
problem, not yours.

372
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,100
If I were you, I'd just
try to avoid her.

373
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,100
Sir, I'd be worried if I was her
and you disappeared.

374
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,400
Well, that shows
how little you know

375
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,600
of marital affairs,
Captain McCrae.

376
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,300
Inez won't be worried,
she'll just be mad.

377
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,000
We're captains now,
Woodrow.

378
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,600
Yeah. I reckon.

379
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,100
If I wasn'awake,
I'd think I was asleep.

380
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,500
I'd think I was
 a dream.

381
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
It ain't a dream, you fool.

382
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,600
Now, don't you be bossing me
too hard today, Gus.

383
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,000
I need a day or two
to adjust to the notion

384
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,100
that you're a captain.

385
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,600
I order you
to shut up about it.

386
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,400
Woodrow's a captain, too.
He going to be

387
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,900
a lot harder boss than me,
once he gets a hang of the job.

388
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,200
Get the hang of it?

389
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,400
Surviving's the hang
of it, Augustus.

390
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,600
Bill, no more...

391
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,700
...wrestle with an Indian than
to try to reason with you!

392
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,400
Which way you think
we ought to go?

393
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,500
Well, aren't you
gonna say something?

394
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,200
You been yappin' ever
since I known you.

395
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,800
Why you suddenly dry up?

396
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,000
Well, where do you
think we ought to go,
if you know so much?

397
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,800
Well, I don't
know so much.

398
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,400
I been taking orders the
whole time I been a Ranger.

399
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,900
Why would I know
any more than you do?

400
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,900
Because you're a studier,
Woodrow.

401
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,300
You been reading in that book
about Napoleon for years now.

402
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,200
Me, I'm mainly
just a whore.

403
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,500
BILL:
I don't know what
made the captain decide

404
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,800
to make them two in charge.

405
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,500
They'd both argue with a stump,
if the stump could talk.

406
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,500
Sure don't seem like the
sensible thing to do, Bill.

407
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,100
One of 'em says yes,
the other says no.

408
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,900
Well, captains ought to
stay with their troops.

409
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,200
Gus and Call decide
to leave us...

410
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,500
we'll be lost, for sure.

411
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,800
All right...

412
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,000
I favor trying
for the Red River.

413
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,700
If we go west, we end up
eating the horses.

414
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,000
Got those extra mules.

415
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,000
I say we eat the mules, if we
have to, and make for the Red.

416
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,700
There's settlements
along the Red,

417
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,100
and plentiful
game, too.

418
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,400
Red was my thinking, too.

419
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,900
Oh, is it, now.

420
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,100
The boys are
depending on us.

421
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,600
We got to keep our heads
and do it right.

422
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,400
No, not today, you don't.

423
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,900
Mind your words, Ben.
Let me pass.

424
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,200
No! Not today
and not tomorrow

425
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,400
and not the next day

426
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,800
and the next week and
not the next month.

427
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:55,800
Not ever.

428
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,400
I been coming here every day
for nearly three weeks now.

429
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
What's wrong with today?

430
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,000
There's nothing wrong
with today.

431
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,900
Just be gone.

432
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,800
I'll be calling the sheriff
on you, if you don't.

433
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,000
And he'll know what to do
with a common lark like you.

434
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,900
Yeah, all right then.

435
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,100
All right, there ain't
no need to call the sheriff.

436
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,600
Why, thanks, Felice.

437
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,800
You're the only one that
don't hate me around here,

438
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,300
it looks like.

439
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,300
I thought I instructed
my butler to run you off.

440
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,100
How come you're not gone?

441
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,100
Ben?

442
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,000
(dogs barking)
I was just resting
a minute.

443
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,900
Get off my step.

444
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I don't want you
round here anymore-- Ben!

445
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,900
(dogs barking)
You stay away from
that yellow wench.

446
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,800
I don't want any
little irregularities

447
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,100
with my help.

448
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,200
But I thought you liked me.

449
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,900
Like you?!

450
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,600
I've stooped to many follies
in my life,

451
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,100
but I doubt I'd
allow myself to like

452
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,300
a common farm boy
such as yourself.

453
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,000
MAN (in distance):
See you first of next week!

454
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,800
It was your hair, Jakey.

455
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,400
Your thick, lovely hair.

456
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,300
I suppose I found it
briefly appealing.

457
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,500
But now it's gone,
and that is that.

458
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,000
Mr. Spoon.

459
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,200
You call Woodrow Call...

460
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,900
Woodrow.

461
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,600
Why won't you call me Jake?

462
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,200
Look, I got money.

463
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,000
All right?
I ain't a cheat.

464
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,900
What are you standing
over there for?

465
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,900
I'm ready.

466
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,900
Hey, I'a Ranger, too.

467
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,900
Just like Ca.

468
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,900
You're still a whore,
ain't you?

469
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,100
Now get over here.

470
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,700
Can I ask you to take off
your boots... Jake?

471
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,200
You been in some mud.

472
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,600
Could you...
could you just help me?

473
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,300
Just... (groans)

474
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,600
something is burning 

475
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,400
Captain, over here!

476
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,600
Oh, Lord!

477
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,500
He was just a you'un.

478
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,100
Keep watching, boys.

479
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,500
They may still be close.

480
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,200
They are close.

481
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,600
There. See that dust?

482
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,900
That's our villains.

483
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,300
Killed the grandad and the boy
'cause they couldn't keep up.

484
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,100
They took the women.

485
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,100
We have to take the captives to Buffalo Hump.

486
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,500
If he says you can have the woman,

487
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,600
you can do what you want with her.

488
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,100
I want to do it here and now.

489
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,200
Take the horses and go.

490
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,400
I'm going to kill the woman.

491
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,500
You're, uh, you're
safe now, ma'am.

492
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,100
We need to go.

493
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,500
There could be 40 more
not far away.

494
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,900
Or 400 more.

495
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,100
My John...!

496
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,700
he won't have me no more!

497
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:40,800
I'll run and
catch her, Captain,

498
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,200
see if I can talk her back.

499
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,200
She's right, you know?

500
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,000
What do you mean, Bill?

501
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,100
Comanche's have had her.

502
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,200
Her husband won't
want her no more.

503
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,800
It's worse than that, Pete.
Nobody will want her.

504
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,000
Missus! Miss!

505
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,200
I can't go back!
I can't!

506
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,600
You got to go
back, Miss.

507
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,900
The little girls
need you.

508
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,200
It's all right, it's
all right, missus.

509
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,900
It's all right now.

510
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,600
Come on.
Let's go back now.

511
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,900
Let's go back now.

512
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,400
I don't know what Ahumado will do

513
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,100
when he sees that I have brought him
the Buffalo Horse.

514
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,600
You think he will give you some
young women as a reward?

515
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,700
Of course he should give me a
woman or two.

516
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,600
Ahumado doesn't do
what he should do.

517
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:25,100
What if he has Goyeto skin you?

518
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,700
Then I'll be skinned.

519
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,300
We are going to the Yellow Cliffs.

520
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:36,300
And I don't plan to die.

521
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,000
Hector leaves
a damn large track.

522
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,200
Kicking Wolf and Three Birds
are walking towards Mexico.

523
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,000
If he is takinthe Buffalo
Horse to Ahumado,

524
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,100
he hopes to go home
with some new wives.

525
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,500
I'd say he's taking
a big risk if he thinks

526
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,900
he can work a simple trade
with that crafty Mayan.

527
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,400
Back in Boston,
saddle of antelope

528
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,600
is considered to be
a great delicacy.

529
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,200
Of course, it's
a rare delicacy, too,

530
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,300
there being very few
pronghorns

531
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,900
in the region
of Boston town.

532
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,300
You walk fast for a white man.

533
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,600
I can walk off
and leave

534
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,700
most white men.

535
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,600
Do you know this Ahumado,
also called "Black Vaquero"?

536
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,500
No one knows Ahumado.

537
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,800
When he was born,
the poison leaf was put

538
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,700
under his tongue.

539
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,000
Because of that,
he could do nothing but evil.

540
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,200
Evil is correct.

541
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,600
We attacked him
in that slaver's den of his.

542
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,700
The Yellow Cliffs one,
he shot Hector and got away.

543
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,600
It rankles me still.

544
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,300
Yellow Ciffs
Northern Mexico

545
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,300
You remember that...
that slick Comanche,

546
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,200
the expert horse thief?

547
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,800
The one who, uh, traded
u horses for women?

548
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,400
Why is that boy yelling so?

549
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,100
He let the cougar get
one of my foals.

550
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,100
I don't raise horses
for cougars to eat.

551
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,300
Goyeto's working on him.

552
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,700
The Comanche, he has stolen
the Buffalo Horse from Scull.

553
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,500
I think he's
bringing him here.

554
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,800
And that ain't
the best of it.

555
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,300
The best of it
is that Scull's
following on foot.

556
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,500
He's got that Kickapoo
tracker with him.

557
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,900
He wants his horse back,
I reckon.

558
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,800
Is anyone alive
in the cages now?

559
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,500
I ain't checked today,
but, uh, I doubt it.

560
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,700
Scull tried to kill me once...
and failed.

561
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,800
I tried to kill him...

562
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,500
and failed.

563
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,000
I didn't expect him
to come back.

564
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,600
The Rangers
is back.
It's the Rangers.

565
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,900
Yeah, coming in!

566
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,900
Looky there.

567
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,600
Look, children.

568
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,900
Billy! Billy! Bill!

569
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,500
Billy!

570
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,200
Billy! Billy!

571
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,300
What a sight.

572
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,700
Hey, Jake, come get
this horse for me, buddy.

573
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,000
Oh, Pearly. Pearly, Pearly,
Pearly, Pearly.

574
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:51,900
Oh, Pearly.

575
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,200
Oh, Billy, thank God
you're safe.

576
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,500
Oh, my darling.
Oh, I could squeeze you in two.

577
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,400
Where's Captain Scull?

578
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,700
Was he killed?

579
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,600
Not that we know of.

580
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,100
H's chasing a horse thief.

581
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,300
Don't be tagging us
now, Jake.

582
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,300
Got a urgent business
to attend to.

583
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,500
Urgent business?

584
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,200
Hello, Mr. Forsythe.

585
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,500
24...

586
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,700
I don't see
Clara anywhere.

587
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,700
25...

588
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,400
She ain't sick,
is she?

589
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,900
I'm trying to count
these gloves.

590
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,200
It takes concentration.

591
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,400
Sorry, sir.

592
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,700
27...

593
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,200
Traveled nearly
to the North Pole and back.

594
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,900
28...

595
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,800
Anxious to see Clara.

596
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,300
29...

597
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,000
30.

598
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,300
She ain't sick, is she?

599
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,500
My daughter's never been sick
a day in her life.

600
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,500
She's as healthy as a horse.

601
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,500
She's out.

602
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,400
Out?

603
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:54,900
Out!

604
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,500
That's the opposite of in,
Mr. McCrae! She's gone!

605
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,600
She n't here!

606
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,000
31, 32...

607
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,200
Running errands, I reckon.

608
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,200
33...

609
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:09,800
35...

610
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:13,100
Well, I got to report
to the Governor, sir.
36...

611
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,400
Hope you tell her
I called.

612
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,300
37, 38...

613
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,500
Darn.

614
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,700
Don't you go
getting drunk
on me, Gus.

615
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,500
The Governor will be
wanting us to report.

616
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,000
You go, Woodrow.
I got other things on my mind.

617
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,400
Now, we're both captains.
We should both go.

618
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,100
Well, I swear.

619
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:07,900
You're not... Jake!

620
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,800
Stable... stable
this horse!

621
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,000
You tell Captain Call
he can find me

622
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,200
in the saloon
if he needs me.

623
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,400
If he wants me to visit that
governor, he better come quick.

624
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,600
Why, you leaving again?
It's not leaving.

625
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,600
I'll be departing from
my right mind.

626
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,300
Kicking Wolf
has taken your horse
into the Sierra.

627
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,300
Three Birds is
still with him,

628
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,500
but Three Birds
does not want to go
into the Sierra.

629
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,400
How can you tell
all that from a track?

630
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,600
I can't.

631
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,800
I know Three Birds.

632
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,000
Three Birds is not crazy.

633
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:53,900
Only a crazy man

634
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,700
would ride into the country
of Ahumado.

635
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,900
Well, that qualifies me
for the asylum then.

636
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,800
Ahumado is always
behind you.

637
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,000
If we go into
his country,

638
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,600
he'll be behind us.

639
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,600
Maybe I should start
walking backwards.

640
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,200
If you couldn't kill
Ahumado

641
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,900
when you had your Rangers
with you,

642
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,800
why do you think
you can kill him now?

643
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,300
Lots of things can go wrong
with a military unit.

644
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,500
Sometimes a man alone
can do better.

645
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,900
I'm a born fighter.

646
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I need opponents to match me.

647
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,000
Perhaps the Black Vaquero
will match me,

648
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,200
but I doubt it.

649
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,900
I don't want the salt
to lose its savor.

650
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,600
Do you understand?

651
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,100
No.

652
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,600
Well, I guess this means you
don't choose to accompany me.

653
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,100
No.

654
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,800
What will you be doing
while have my little contest

655
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,200
with the Black Vaquero?

656
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,400
There's a whole in the Earth
somewhere to the west.

657
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,800
Turtle brought the Kickapoo
people out of that hole

658
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,200
and into the sunlight.

659
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,500
I want to find it.

660
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,100
My task is simpler.

661
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,300
I just want my Hector back.

662
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,200
Thank you for your help.

663
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,600
er table manners
is to drink from a glass.

664
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,600
Or from a saucer.

665
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,400
No, no, not
a durn saucer.

666
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,800
Saucer might do
for sipping coffee

667
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,000
if it's too hot
to imbibe from the cup.

668
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,200
Does that suit ya?

669
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,600
And don't call me Captain.

670
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,400
Plain Gus McCrae.

671
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,200
Hello, Bingham.

672
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,400
Hello, Captain.

673
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,200
Got the buggy ready.

674
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,100
Governor wants to see you.

675
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,100
You're as broad as
this buggy, Bingham.

676
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,300
A man who sits behind you
don't have much of a view.

677
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,600
Nosir.
Get a view of me mostly.

678
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,800
Hey, get up.

679
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,900
I'm surprised
you drink like that

680
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,700
before you say
hello to Clara.

681
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,100
MCCRAE:
Why would I say
hello to her?

682
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:21,000
I seen her in a buggy with
that horse trader Bob Allen.

683
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,700
He's been trying to steal
her from me.

684
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,200
I guess he succeeded.

685
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,300
That wasn't
Bob Allen, you fool.

686
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,400
That was her uncle
from Galveston.

687
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,800
He's come for a visit.

688
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,700
Her uncle?

689
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,800
Gus?

690
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,500
Bye.

691
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,100
What?

692
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,200
What is your hurry?
You just got here.

693
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,800
You been gone
over a month.

694
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,200
It's the governor.
I gotta report.

695
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,900
Old Scull left us
in the lurch.

696
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
At least Woodrow and
got made captains.

697
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,800
It's the governor, Clara.

698
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,800
Well, if it wasn't
the governor,

699
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,300
it would be
somebody else.

700
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,400
A Comanche you had to fight

701
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,200
or a bandit you got to catch.

702
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,600
Gus...

703
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,500
Oh.

704
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,600
My Ranger.

705
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:46,700
You mean Inish has lost himself
and over a damn horse?

706
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,600
It was his
war horse, Governor.

707
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,500
He held that horse
in high regard.

708
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,700
Yes, and what about his duty
to the State of Texas?

709
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,100
Did he hold that
in high regard?

710
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,300
I guess he thought we
could get the boys home safe.

711
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,300
We done it.

712
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,800
We recovered
those captives, too.

713
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,100
Yes.

714
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,300
Though I doubt the woman
will recover.

715
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,100
They rarely do.

716
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,600
Inish Scull
used good judgment

717
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,400
in making you captains.

718
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,700
And I'll second it.

719
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,200
You both got a bright future...

720
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,700
if you can keep your hair.

721
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,500
Now, meanwhile,

722
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,000
we got thousands of hostile
Comanche's to contend with.

723
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,300
And a whole nation
to the south of us

724
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,100
who don't like us one bit.

725
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,600
And the worst is,
he's left us with Inez.

726
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,100
I believe we can hold our
own with the Comanche

727
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,500
and I expect we can
whip back e Mexicans,

728
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,100
but the heavens
are going to ring

729
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,800
when Inez Scull finds out

730
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,200
why her husband didn't
care to come home.

731
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,400
Ed?!

732
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,700
ED:
From my reports,
they did a fine job, Inez.

733
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:51,200
Only lost one man,
and that from
natural causes.

734
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,100
Two if you count Inish.

735
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,000
I decline to be impressed.

736
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,600
They both need barbering.

737
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,900
And this one slouches.

738
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,000
What kind of
soldier slouches?

739
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,900
Excuse me, ma'am,
but we ain't soldiers.

740
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,400
We're Texas Rangers.

741
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,800
In rangering, posture
ain't the important thing.

742
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,500
Oh.

743
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,400
And what is the important thing?

744
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,300
Guts, plain guts.

745
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,000
ED:
All right,ow, McCrae,
Mrs. Scull is just upset

746
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,900
because the Captain didn't
come home with the troops...

747
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,400
INEZ:
Oh, shut up, Ed!

748
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,900
I'm not so ill-bred
as to be upset.

749
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,900
I'm angry, and I detest
un-barbered louts!

750
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,900
I imagine these two
green ears of corn

751
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,700
both put whoring
before barbering.

752
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,400
Most men would, Inez.
It's only normal.

753
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,100
Why, Ed, you got more
spunk than I thought.

754
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,200
Captain went looking
for his horse, ma'am.

755
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,100
No, he left to spite me.

756
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,100
Hector was just an exce.

757
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,600
He'd just as soon eat
a horse as ride one.

758
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,100
(voice breaking):
Have them go
fetch him, Ed.

759
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,900
Inez, they just got back.

760
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,100
They need to rest
and so do their horses.

761
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,500
INEZ:
All right.

762
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,900
but they mustn't
wait long

763
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
or Inish will vanish
for good if given the chance.

764
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
all right, all right, all right.

765
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,200
(sobbing)
All right.

766
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,000
You will send them?

767
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,300
Thank you, Ed.

768
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,200
Slouchy as you are,

769
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:18,300
I might like you
to come to tea at my house.

770
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,800
What about Captain Call?

771
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,800
Too stiff.

772
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,500
Bye.

773
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,800
Well, I do apologize,
gentlemen.

774
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,400
I brought you in here
to compliment you on
your captaincies,

775
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,100
but Inez barged in
and spoiled it.

776
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,800
Why come home just to be
ate alive by your wife?

777
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,800
Inish Scull is a Yankee
son of a bitch

778
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:48,500
and his wife is a...
Southern slut.

779
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,500
Inez Scull would try
the patience of a saint.

780
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,100
Why, I believe she would even
try the patience of Job.

781
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,400
I don't know Job, sir,
but she sure tried mine.

782
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,400
Lord

783
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,000
Kicking Wolf, I assume.

784
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,000
You're the genius
that stole my horse.

785
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,700
Which I see, incidentally,
you don't have.

786
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,100
Tit for tat.

787
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,200
Bible and sword.

788
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,200
There is a pit down there.

789
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,800
I could put you in it.

790
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,500
But your name is Three Birds.

791
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,400
You should enjoy one of our cages.

792
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:55,900
That way you can watch your friends,the birds.

793
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,700
These cages are filthy.

794
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,800
I don't want to be in one.

795
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,400
If he doesn't like our cages...

796
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,300
take him down.

797
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,400
Let Goyeto work on him.

798
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,300
You are stupid man.

799
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,600
A child could fool you.

800
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,800
Scull is coming.

801
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,600
He is not a child.

802
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:13,600
Why does he stand there night
after night?

803
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:43,200
I want runners to go out to all
the bands.

804
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,700
To the Antelope Comanche.
To Threes Bears.

805
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:48,600
We will fight as one band.

806
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:52,500
We will raid all the way to the ocean.

807
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,900
Why do we need the others?

808
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:58,900
We can kill the Texans without any help.

809
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,700
Do you kill Call when you went to kill him?

810
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,400
Or did he shoot you?

811
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,300
He was lucky.

812
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:15,400
He was better than you.

813
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
They will get stronger,until they
fight berrer than we fight.

814
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:29,500
You don't like to hear this.

815
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,100
But it's ture.

816
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:36,100
We must fighr the Texans
and defeat them,now.

817
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:42,500
Otherwise they will break us,and the
way of the Comanche will disappear.

818
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,800
To do this,we need all the bands.

819
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,400
Go.In seven days we go to the 
Great Water.

820
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:58,400
We kill every Texan we find.

821
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,100
That was mighty tasty. 

822
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,900
You're a fine cook, Maggie.

823
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,700
Thank you.

824
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,300
But I grew up in Virginia,

825
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,200
where there's more
vegetables to choose from.

826
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,000
Well, I can live without
too much greenery myself.

827
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,300
Woodrow...

828
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,500
I got some news.

829
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:47,600
I'm gonna have a baby.

830
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,300
What?

831
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,300
I said I'm gonna have a baby.

832
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,800
It's your baby, Woodrow.

833
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,100
My baby?

834
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,500
Well, it's ours, I mean.

835
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,000
Oh.

836
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,500
Well, Maggie, uh...

837
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,300
That <i>is</i> news.

838
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,600
I'm just hoping the governor

839
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,300
doesn't send you off after
Captain Scull.

840
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,900
Well, probably will.

841
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,200
That Scull's after him

842
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,400
hot and heavy.

843
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:31,700
You certain there's a baby?

844
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,800
I'm sure, Woodrow.

845
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,000
Well, uh, you know...

846
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,600
least  got some time
to think about it.

847
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,400
Hmm...

848
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,300
I suppose that
fella Bob Allen

849
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,400
gave up and went
back to Nebraska.

850
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,300
What makes you think so?

851
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:09,000
Well, if he ain't, and I
catch him making up to you,

852
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,700
he's likely to
get a whipping.

853
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Gus, I don't know that
you could whip B,

854
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:17,200
and I'd much rather
you didn't try.

855
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,400
And why would you doubt
that I could whip him?

856
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,700
I'm a Texas Ranger.

857
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,200
Well, I reckon you
could shoot him.

858
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:30,200
But if it were fisticuffs
you were talking about...

859
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,100
I doubt you'd
stand much a chance.

860
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,700
Bob is stout.

861
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,400
That's one thing
I like about him.

862
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:43,200
Like about him?

863
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,100
You like about him?

864
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,700
Don't tell me you
two have been spooning

865
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,500
while I've been off
doing my duty.

866
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:52,000
Got your goat, didn't I?

867
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,400
Besides which,
we ain't married.

868
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,400
What I do while
you're off Rangering

869
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,000
is my business, Gussie.

870
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:06,700
Durn if you're not about as
independent as they come.

871
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,600
Gussie?

872
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,800
You didn't say good night.

873
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,000
I might've wanted a kiss.

874
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,000
Clara, I have had... 

875
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,900
Durn you, Clara!

876
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,300
I get on my horse backwards,
which I'll never live down.

877
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,000
Now I t my hat on
backwards, too!

878
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,000
I won't tell.

879
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,700
(mutters):
God...

880
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,500
What was that clatter?

881
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,900
It was only Gus, Mama.

882
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,800
I was teasing him a little.

883
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,200
About what?

884
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,500
May I ask?

885
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,400
I just happened
to mention Bob Allen,

886
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,000
and it putim in a dither.

887
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,400
Well, it should have.

888
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,400
Bob Allen's a decent man
in a solid trade.

889
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,600
He'd make any woman
a fine husband.

890
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:08,100
(sighs):
I know, Ma.

891
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,500
But Gus McCrae
is my one true love.

892
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,900
There are two kinds of men
in this world, honey.

893
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,100
The marrying kind
and men like Gus.

894
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:25,800
You may have his heart, Clara,
but you'll never have the man.

895
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:29,500
He will wander God's green
Earth until the day he dies.

896
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,900
If you think you can settle
Gus McCrae down, Clara,

897
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:41,500
then you need
to think again.

898
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,900
Because you won't.

899
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:49,600
Whoa.

900
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:54,900
There goes your rival.

901
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,000
Mind your own business.

902
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,100
Clara thinks he can whip me.

903
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,000
I imagine he can whip you.

904
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,800
He's at least a foot taller
and maybe 50 pounds heavier.

905
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,700
Shut up! You don't
know nothing about it.

906
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,000
Maybe not.

907
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:22,600
But if I was looking
for a fistfight,

908
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,600
I wouldn't challenge Bob Allen.

909
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,400
Be common sense to look
for someone smaller.

910
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,600
Common sense be damned!

911
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,900
I'll whip him before breakfast,
then I'll probably whip you. 

912
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,400
And maybe Long
Bill Coleman, too.

913
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,800
Why Long Bill?

914
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:47,400
Because he's always criticizing,
the damn schoolmarm, that's why.

915
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,400
That buffalo horse was,
uh... that was some horse.

916
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,700
Took more than four
days to cook him.

917
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:17,400
Bible and sword-- well, that is
a sight I never expected to see.

918
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,300
Mind cutting me off a slice?

919
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,500
I've had nothing but
varmints these last few days.

920
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,900
Hmm...

921
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:00,100
Let's see, uh...

922
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,000
This one's
about your size.

923
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,700
And I'd say you're dead.

924
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,700
If you can't catch
enough birds to eat,

925
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:36,600
I will put you
in my pit.

926
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,500
Well, the pigeons
seem plentiful.

927
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,100
Squab is always welcome
at the Scull table,

928
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:47,100
and it's best eaten rare,
of course.

929
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:50,000
No. I could hardly ask for more.

930
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,300
The Texans may try
to ransom you.

931
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,300
They might. I'm popular.

932
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,800
Why did you come here?

933
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,500
To kill you.

934
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:03,400
Why else?

935
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:08,200
Do you still believe
you will kill me?

936
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:11,800
I do, and I'm rarely mistaken.

937
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,500
Put him over.

938
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,700
That's wasteful, if you ask me.

939
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:16,900
I didn't ask you.

940
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:23,400
You're burning ammunition
we might need.

941
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:28,300
The governor wants
to see us pronto.

942
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,700
That durn governor
is becoming a pest.

943
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:34,200
Yeah.

944
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:36,200
Well, he's
the governor,

945
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:37,600
and we work for him.

946
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,900
Have you thrown
a three-day drunk

947
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
just 'cause Clara told you

948
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,800
she thought her other
beau could whip you?

949
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,000
I threw a three-day drunk
for pleasure, mostly.

950
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,500
I like three-day drunks.

951
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:24,500
Go along,
Captain Call.

952
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,300
Need a word
with Captain McCrae.

953
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,400
I'll be but a minute.

954
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,700
Aren't you even going
to speak to me?

955
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,200
Hello.

956
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,800
Oh, stop it, Gussie.

957
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,200
How long do I have
to be punished

958
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,800
for not doing anything wrong?

959
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:53,200
Who said you didn't
do anything wrong?

960
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:54,800
I say it, and you better listen!

961
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:55,800
All right, don't yell, now.

962
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,300
This horse is apt to throw me.

963
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:02,900
This the horse
you got on backwards?

964
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,100
Yep.

965
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:07,300
Why did you do that, Gus?

966
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:12,800
Because... I was so
in love with you

967
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:15,100
I couldn't tell backwards
from forwards.

968
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,300
That's better.

969
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:26,400
Will I see you tonight?

970
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,300
You bet.

971
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,500
Well, look at these.

972
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,400
All from generals and
senators and the like,

973
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:41,300
all telling me
I got to find Scull.

974
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,500
You would think
the sun might
refuse to shine

975
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,600
if Inish Scull
leaves out a pot.

976
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,200
He's rich, he's famous,

977
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:49,900
and he is the best military man
in this part of the country.

978
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
And he ain't here.

979
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:54,400
With the plains,
from what I hear,
starting to boil.

980
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:57,700
Well, Ben, what do you want?

981
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,100
We're busy.

982
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,600
My mistress is wanting
an answer, sir.

983
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,100
Request declined.

984
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:37,100
I did you a favor, Captain.

985
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,300
At least it's a favor
if you value your virtue.

986
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:43,000
I'd as soon take tea
with a grizzly bear, sir.

987
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:44,200
Well, I doubt
we've heard

988
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:45,900
the end of it.

989
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,200
Inez is nothing
if not persistent.

990
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,900
But to the business at hand.

991
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Now, I want the two of you
to take some men

992
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,000
and find out what you can
about Inish Scull.

993
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:59,000
I want you to ride
fast, and hurry back.

994
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,700
If Inish is captive,
we need to know it.

995
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:02,800
Maybe he can be ransomed.

996
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,600
Our horses are 
worn out, Governor.

997
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:06,300
I know.

998
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,900
Now, there is a horse trader
hereabouts named Allen.

999
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,500
Now, he brought in
some fresh horses

1000
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:11,600
just yesterday.

1001
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,600
Now, maybe we can
acquire a few from him.

1002
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:15,700
I'll go see the man, then.

1003
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,500
Well, choose your mounts,
gentlemen.

1004
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:21,800
The State will compensate
Mr. Allen.

1005
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,900
I'd like you to leave
as soon as possible.

1006
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,100
We'll be gone by daybreak, sir.

1007
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:28,100
Thank you.

1008
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,000
Drat that man!

1009
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:44,500
Ever since
's been made governor,

1010
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,700
he's as pigheaded as Inish.

1011
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,200
He is good at
catching pigeons,

1012
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
but he will need to catch
some water when it rains.

1013
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:30,600
I want you to climb up there
and give him a bowl.

1014
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,600
Ah! I am not
a good climber.

1015
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:38,500
Then this is your chance
to learn.

1016
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,200
Scull is a famous man.

1017
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,700
Texans will pay a
big ransom for him.

1018
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,000
Then we will kill him.

1019
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,800
What's the matter?

1020
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:04,100
It's what's always the matter.

1021
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,700
You're my only
sweetheart, Clara.

1022
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,500
What could be the matter?

1023
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:13,600
You're my sweetheart, too,
and now you're leaving again.

1024
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:15,100
I'm a Ranger, honey.

1025
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:17,400
Even though
I'm a captain,

1026
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,900
I still ain't my own boss
much of the time.

1027
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,200
Governor says go look 
for Inish Scull,

1028
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:23,800
that's what
I have to do.

1029
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,500
I don't want to hear
your excuses anymore.

1030
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:26,800
But it's the truth.

1031
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,400
It's just the truth
you choose to hide behind

1032
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:29,800
every time you leave me.

1033
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:31,900
It is not written in the heavens

1034
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,700
that you have
to be a Texas Ranger.

1035
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,600
There are plenty of other
things you could do

1036
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:37,900
that would be more settled.

1037
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,100
Like what?

1038
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:41,600
Well, yocould be a barber.

1039
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,300
Or maybe even a judge.

1040
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,100
Me a durn barber?

1041
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,700
Well, maybe a judge
would suit you better.

1042
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:52,800
If I was a judge,

1043
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:54,600
I'd hang half the scoundrels
in this town,

1044
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:56,000
and that would be that.

1045
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:59,100
All right. Then I don't know
what you could be,

1046
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,100
but you're my dearest
and my deepest, Gussie.

1047
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:07,000
I just can't stand
all this leaving.

1048
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,400
I... I simply can't.

1049
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,800
We'll only be gone a week.
A week ain't long.

1050
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,400
It is if you're lonely.

1051
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,600
A week can be mighty long.

1052
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:19,200
I'm not a woman
who does well alone.

1053
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:36,500
Clara...

1054
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,400
I want us to marry.

1055
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:41,400
I want us to marry

1056
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,800
when I come back.

1057
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,400
 <i>If</i> you come back.

1058
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,600
Damn it, Clara,
I'll come back.

1059
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:51,800
I always come back.

1060
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:55,200
I'll be with
Woodrow Call.

1061
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,000
No one's more
cautious on the trail

1062
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,700
than Woodrow Call.

1063
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,800
I wish he would marry Maggie.

1064
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:04,800
We all wish that.

1065
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:06,900
He ought to, and
maybe someday he will.

1066
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:10,700
But, right now, it's you
I'm worried about.

1067
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,900
Well, you don't need
to worry about me too much.

1068
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,500
Even if I was
to marry somebody else,

1069
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,700
I still want you
to be my friend.

1070
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,400
I still want you
to know my children.

1071
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,400
Marry someone else?
What kind of talk is that?

1072
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,300
 <i>Your</i> children?
Why can't they be <i>our</i> children?

1073
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:32,600
All ght. Don't
talk no more, Gus.

1074
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,500
Hold me.

1075
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:35,800
Hold me tight.

1076
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,400
I doubt there'll be trouble.

1077
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:44,800
We'll only be gone a week.

1078
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,200
But if there is, you remember
that hideout I showed you.

1079
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,300
I remember.

1080
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,100
Come back safe, Woodw.

1081
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:16,600
Remember what I said.

1082
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,000
If there's trouble, be quick.

1083
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,700
MCCRAE:
We'll need, uh,
Long Bill,

1084
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:57,200
Stove Jones and
Ikey, I suppose.

1085
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,500
Let's leave Ikey.

1086
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,700
He's old, and we'll be
traveling night and day.

1087
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:02,800
I think we should
take Jake.

1088
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,200
That worthless pup?

1089
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:09,100
WOODROW:
He's got to get a bit
of experience sometime.

1090
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:10,900
Well, he'll need to
keep up and shut up.

1091
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:11,900
Jake's a blabber.

1092
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:16,600
Well, I heard you
blab a bit yourself.

1093
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:20,000
We'll take Dietz,
PI, and be off.

1094
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:23,300
what

1095
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:26,200
？？

1096
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:56,600
Hurry back
to me, Billy.

1097
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,100
Don't get killed.

1098
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,800
I won't,nless you
don't let go of me,

1099
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,300
and they shoot me
for desertion.

1100
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,300
I have to go.

1101
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:13,600
Honey, don't run after me.

1102
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:14,900
You'll jostle the bait.

1103
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,200
Careful now, Clara.

1104
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,400
MCCRAE:
Hard to leave my Clara.

1105
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,000
She's the finest gal alive.

1106
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,000
You don't think she'd go off
and do something silly, do you?

1107
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:09,800
Like what?

1108
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:12,700
Like marry that damned
horse trader from Nebraska.

1109
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:18,000
Well, if she did, I don't
know that I'd call it silly.

1110
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,100
Maybe he's a better
catch than you.

1111
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:23,200
Well,  ain't.

1112
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:25,300
And how would you
know anyway, Woodrow?

1113
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:33,100
Where's he going,
Captain?

1114
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:35,400
I don't know,
and he don't either.

1115
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:51,400
Thank you.

1116
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,100
Well, now I roped 
the filly that

1117
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,400
I really care about.

1118
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:09,000
"Care about," Bob?

1119
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:10,100
Well, yeah.

1120
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:13,100
Well, I guess I <i>wa</i> roped.

1121
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,400
but nobody tightened
the loop.

1122
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:18,100
And now... I'm not.

1123
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:34,600
I tell you,
he's a witch.

1124
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:38,300
I wish you would let me
cut out his tongue.

1125
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,900
If he still thinks
he can kill me,

1126
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:44,700
he needs to keep his spirits up.

1127
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:47,800
So, he sings.

1128
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:54,500
You complain again,

1129
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,700
I will puncture your eardrums
with a thorn.

1130
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,700
And you won't be bothered
when Scull sings.

1131
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:30,600
The settlers and farmers are all along
the Brazos.

1132
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:33,400
The river of Many Forks.

1133
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:36,400
We will go down these forks.

1134
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,400
and kill them.

1135
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:42,200
Slow Tree can talk the Prairie
Dod Fork.

1136
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:45,000
I will take the Clear Fork.

1137
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,800
Slipping Weasel

1138
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,000
can take the Double Mountain Fork.

1139
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:56,581
We will meet near the town where
Scull and Call live.

1140
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:02,637
We will burn it down.

1141
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,400
It was in my youth

1142
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:12,400
that the Texans practiceed
their treachery...

1143
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:18,800
...under the lure of the white flag

1144
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:22,800
...my father,my grandfather and
the grandfathers of many Pepole

1145
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,800
trusted the Texans.

1146
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:29,600
Many went in to parley without their weapons...

1147
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:33,600
...only a few were wise,and hid
their knives...

1148
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:39,600
Great chieftains of
the mighty Comanche nation.

1149
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:44,900
...while the Texans surrounded the tent.

1150
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,200
There is enough room

1151
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:52,900
for all peoples
to live in harmony.

1152
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:47,900
Now while we are strong

1153
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,000
is the time of our revenge.

1154
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,300
Are the signs good?

1155
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:59,300
Yes.Many.Texans will die.

1156
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:50,200
