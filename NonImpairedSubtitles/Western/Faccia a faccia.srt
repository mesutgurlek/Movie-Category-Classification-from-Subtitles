1
00:00:02,702 --> 00:00:07,105
I've an announcement to make and
I find it very painful.

2
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:11,034
I'm unable to continue
this history course.

3
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:13,969
But as you perhaps know

4
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,640
it's not a matter of my own volition.

5
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:24,815
However, the study of history can be
suspended and resumed at any point.

6
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:28,253
Because

7
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,297
though all men must die in time,

8
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,192
other men will make history live.

9
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:42,838
And each man can choose
his own part in history.

10
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:45,066
We've been forced to choose.

11
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:49,171
When the war between the States
declared that we were either

12
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:53,715
Union loyalists or Confederate rebels.

13
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,747
You are twenty years old.

14
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,714
You will have to choose, many times,

15
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,818
between just and unjust,
truth and untruth.

16
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:08,761
And always the answer is
only to be found

17
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,235
within you.

18
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,004
And if this small bit of knowledge
can help you in the future,

19
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:24,145
then I'm truly privileged
for my part in history

20
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,412
will not have been useless.

21
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,951
The class is dismissed. Thank you.

22
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:47,062
My dear Professor Fletcher. Miss Wilkins
I and I look forward to your return.

23
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,606
I hope you're not disappointed.

24
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:52,542
Come, come, Fletcher.
You're not as sick as all that.

25
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:56,808
Tomorrow you'll be far away from this
horrible climate. You'll feel differently.

26
00:01:56,916 --> 00:02:00,875
I feel sure your lungs will improve
as soon as you put your foot in,

27
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:05,314
Texas. And you'll come back here
to Boston completely recovered.

28
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:06,647
Yes sir, no doubt.

29
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,659
You talk as though you don't care.

30
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:12,757
And I must say, given your intelligence,

31
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,458
you should have gone far,
a lot farther than you have.

32
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:15,761
But I'm not complaining.

33
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,303
That's just the trouble.
You have no ambition.

34
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,304
That's why you've never been promoted.

35
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:25,036
In this country there are no limits
for the man who is willing to fight.

36
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,272
You've never struggled against
the position fate has put you in.

37
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,510
But that is what you must do now,
more than ever.

38
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,780
Well, I'm late for class.
Have a good trip.

39
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:39,881
Goodbye, Dean.

40
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,464
Well, Miss Wilkins...

41
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,727
He's probably right about me, you know.

42
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,633
Well, I don't believe him. Professor.

43
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,108
That's good of you, Elizabeth.

44
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,056
Are you asleep. Professor?

45
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,831
No, but very nearly.

46
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,900
I couldn't sleep last night
because of you and your Paco

47
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,269
raising Cain in the next bedroom.

48
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,537
Why, Professor, I do not understand,

49
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,178
My dear, I don't believe you.

50
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,838
El amor, it is not wrong.

51
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,752
You do not think it is wrong to love,
do you, Professor?

52
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:39,523
Because Paco has gone away,
and I feel so lonely.

53
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:41,919
Lonely?

54
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,994
Who'd be coming up here?

55
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,349
Get out, go on!

56
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,083
Get down there where you belong!

57
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,918
Give us a little drink,
something nice and cool.

58
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,768
Sheriff! This half breed,
he looks like Beauregard Bennet!

59
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,774
It ain't no affair of yours.

60
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,675
Hurry up, we're thirsty!

61
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:34,541
But, Sheriff, maybe this could turn out
to be an affair of mine

62
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,639
if we have a visit from Bennet's amigos.

63
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,044
All his amigos are underground.

64
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:45,522
That is, except for one
who escaped our ambush! Zachary Shawn.

65
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,719
But we'll get him too
and then the Bennet gang is through.

66
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,451
Water!

67
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,827
Don't talk so much and
you won't get thirsty.

68
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,601
Just a minute.

69
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,069
Hey you, what do you
think you're doing?

70
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,145
I'm going to give him a drink.

71
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,077
Hold it! You're doing nothing
for that man.

72
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:13,246
All members of a civilized society
have fundamental human rights.

73
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,649
What's the guy talking about?

74
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:18,952
Quien sabe, sheriff. He's a professor
from the East. He reads a lot of books.

75
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,958
Well, Professor,listen to me.

76
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,927
That man's a cheap killer.
Keep your philosophy for someone else.

77
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,361
A killer, eh?

78
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:30,198
You see, in this country nobody can
be presumed guilty of a crime

79
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,204
before a correctly constituted court
of law declares that guilt proven.

80
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,638
All right, all right, spare me the
lecture, give him a drink.

81
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:36,673
Thank you.

82
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,828
Drop your guns or I'll kill him!

83
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,989
You, get on the coach and
start going as soon as we're inside.

84
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,865
Go on,

85
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,946
Mas suerte!

86
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:36,064
I, uh, I'm afraid you could hardly
have made a worse choice of hostage.

87
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:41,230
I'm terribly ill,
it's the lungs you know.

88
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:45,202
Yeah? But the sheriff's men didn't know.

89
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:55,551
Go faster, go!

90
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:07,986
What for?

91
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,419
You might as well be dead
if you're so sick.

92
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:11,518
I?

93
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:17,028
But I'm, I might recover, after all,
I mean it's possible!

94
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,928
And even if I don't, this doesn't
make sense. I've never done you any harm.

95
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,404
You have no reason to kill me.

96
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,577
Yeah, you're right. Why kill a dead man.

97
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,710
Anyway, I may need
an extra bullet some time.

98
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,307
How are you feeling?

99
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:06,878
I'm feeling like I have a bullet
in my guts, that's how I'm feeling.

100
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,150
I did the best I could.
I put you on one of the horses,

101
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,087
but then after nightfall I got lost.

102
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:16,150
In the morning I found this stream and
I thought maybe I could clean that wound.

103
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,288
No, don't. In your condition,
you shouldn't move.

104
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,367
Then lemme die, leave me alone.

105
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,936
I wouldn't leave my
worst enemy here like this.

106
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,473
Besides, where do you want me to go?

107
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,673
I don't even know where I am right now.

108
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,946
I know a hideout.
If you could get me to it.

109
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:43,953
Where?

110
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,594
Well, haven't much choice I guess.

111
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:53,956
Take my gun. Professor.

112
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:54,657
Why?

113
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,098
Take it, I said!

114
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:06,569
Aim for the side,
where the chain joins the manacle,

115
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,940
Yes, but how do you fire this?

116
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,573
Pull back the hammer!
Haven't you ever fired a gun?

117
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,915
This thing? That could
be dangerous, couldn't it?

118
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,115
Yes, Professor, it could.

119
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,690
And remember, it's loaded. And
it shoots when you pull the trigger.

120
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,167
Try again,

121
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:32,270
that's it.

122
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,130
Get closer,

123
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:38,702
here.

124
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:16,045
Look under the floorboards
beside the far window.

125
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:22,581
What's the matter?

126
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:27,453
What's the matter?
I'm coughing, I mustn't exert myself.

127
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:32,423
Don't let me down,
you bastard, when I need you!

128
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,800
Do what I say!

129
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,274
Under the floor,

130
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,409
near the window;

131
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,013
use that axe:

132
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,681
break the boards!

133
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:55,712
Go on,

134
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,147
get moving!

135
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,686
Break that board!

136
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,362
Break it. Professor.

137
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,365
That's right!
Now lift it out!

138
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,834
What's the matter with you?!

139
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,098
Hurry!

140
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,643
I can't, I can't,
I'm not well, I can't do it!

141
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,907
You gotta do it, I tell you! You gotta!

142
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:24,439
Lift it out!

143
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,553
I can't, I'm too weak.

144
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,954
Sure you can.

145
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,816
That's right, lift it out.

146
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,534
There's something hidden under here.

147
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:53,468
It's full of supplies,
guns, medicines,

148
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,815
Yes, I know, Professor.

149
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:00,273
I know.

150
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,896
Put that bottle down.

151
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,890
Now do what I tell you.
Put the blade of the knife in the wound.

152
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:48,560
Make it bigger if you have to until you
feel the point begin to scrape the bullet.

153
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,236
That's it! You felt it.

154
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:59,241
Go on! That's it, hurry!

155
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:06,682
Shove the blade in! Go on! I said!

156
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,989
Are you afraid? Further in!

157
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,992
No... please, I can't do it,
I can't do it!

158
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:44,981
Look at that!

159
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:48,682
Look at it!

160
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:52,622
It wanted to kill me, look.

161
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:56,124
Now that it's out I'm going
to live! I'll live! Understand?!

162
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,767
Excellent shot.

163
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,543
Only I'm still too slow.

164
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:09,647
Too slow? I'd say
you were a pretty fast draw.

165
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:12,842
There's plenty of space on Boot Hill
for pretty fast draws.

166
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:18,316
Ever since I was ten I spent two hours
every day practising to be fastest.

167
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,919
Since you were ten, huh?

168
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:26,624
Your life would have been very different
if you'd devoted all that time to books.

169
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,693
If you'd used it
training your brain to think

170
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:33,402
instead of practising
how to draw a pistol.

171
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:43,743
There's no doubt that holding it
gives one a curious sense of power.

172
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:49,253
It seems so natural,
as though it had become part of me.

173
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:56,452
Look, Beau, I hit it!
I aimed at it and I hit it.

174
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:57,386
Good!

175
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,326
It was easy.

176
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,528
There goes our dinner! Get it!

177
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,599
Look!

178
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:12,473
What's the matter? Didn't you ever
eat rabbit back East.

179
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:15,476
Yes, of course, although

180
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:19,608
we have someone else do the killing
for us and we don't think about it.

181
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,843
Besides, out here in the West

182
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:26,357
it's difficult to distinguish
the instinct for survival

183
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,424
from the lust to acquire power.

184
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,002
Why do you want to worry
about things like that?

185
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,766
It's impossible for me to stop thinking.
For example, we have plenty of provisions.

186
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:47,038
Therefore You could easily
have spared that rabbit.

187
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,575
Over here.

188
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:58,089
What are you going to do?

189
00:20:58,824 --> 00:20:59,848
Do you know him?

190
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,757
No, and I don't want him to know me.

191
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:08,299
Are you crazy? Put that away!

192
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,462
It's not like shooting a rabbit.
I'll get rid of him.

193
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,911
Hi, there, stranger!
I didn't hear you coming,

194
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,045
but you're welcome.

195
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:43,258
It's a real pleasure to see another human
being after all these weeks alone here.

196
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,665
What can I do for you, friend?

197
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,429
You can take me to Beauregard.

198
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:50,539
What?

199
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,242
Who's Beauregard?

200
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,443
Solomon Bennet,

201
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:58,812
known as Beauregard.
Tell him I wanna talk.

202
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,145
But I don't know who you are.

203
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,082
Shut up.

204
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:06,084
And you, take off your gunbelt.

205
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:22,763
I'm Siringo, Charley Siringo.

206
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,839
So I finally found you, didn't I, Beau?

207
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,741
How did you find me?

208
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,774
I looked around.

209
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,084
I heard that Bennet's Raiders

210
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,849
used to have one of their hide-outs
around here somewhere.

211
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,116
What do you want?

212
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:43,226
I wanna work for you, wanna help
you reorganize Bennet's Raiders.

213
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:44,829
That's what you have in mind, isn't it?

214
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:48,896
We'll begin with Zachary Shawn.
Once he's out of jail,

215
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,667
collect the other boys, and as for the
dead... huh, replace them. How about it?

216
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:57,300
D' you wanna do it?

217
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,742
You really think I'm going to accept
just anybody who offers to join?

218
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:01,744
No,

219
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,275
but then I'm

220
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:08,144
not just anybody.

221
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,600
These posters are my references.

222
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:56,126
This is my good luck charm

223
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:57,928
from my first sheriff.

224
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:10,207
Did you ever hear talk of the

225
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,784
Pinkertons?

226
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:17,343
Sure, it's a private detective agency.

227
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:24,562
Well, of all the lawmen on my trail
these days, they're the most troublesome.

228
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,557
They could make up a story like yours.

229
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:29,825
I understand.

230
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:34,301
But this'll prove that I don't have
anything to do with them.

231
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:44,913
A Pinkertons' man would've shot the
both of you by now. Who'd stop him?

232
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,139
I would.

233
00:24:57,295 --> 00:25:02,426
I admit you're plenty smart and that's
the main reason why I want to work for you.

234
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,696
I'm afraid not.

235
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,898
I haven't begun my recruiting

236
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,639
and maybe I never will.

237
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:14,701
All right.

238
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:23,978
I'm a very patient type. If you want me,
all you have to do is whistle.

239
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:27,086
I'll probably be
near enough to hear you.

240
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:28,381
What are you doing?

241
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:32,921
Clearing out.
I don't want any more visitors.

242
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:37,098
Must we?
This is a good place.

243
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,830
D' you think so?
Then why don't you stay here.

244
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:42,128
Yes,

245
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:44,267
I might.

246
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,400
Because you're going to begin doing

247
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:50,709
what that fellow said: getting Bennet's
Raiders together again, aren't you?

248
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:51,543
That's natural.

249
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,844
Natural?

250
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:57,052
You picked the right word. Naturally
a wild beast returns to violence,

251
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:58,452
creeps out of the hole where he's

252
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:01,348
been licking his wounds and
joins the pack again.

253
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:05,896
You're an animal, incapable of thought.
You kill people from sheer stupidity.

254
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,001
Tell me: what would you do
if you were stronger than I am, Brad?

255
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:21,274
Oh, don't cry,

256
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,307
it's nothing.

257
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:31,720
You have a different kind of strength
and you have it here, not here.

258
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:36,089
Listen, you know what
we're going to do now?

259
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:40,363
I have to meet one of the boys
in Purgatory City.

260
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:44,526
Tomorrow there's a train.
You be on it and clear out.

261
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:47,161
Get me? You should go back East!

262
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,296
Good morning.

263
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:52,069
I'd like a room so I can rest.
I'm waiting for the train.

264
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:57,372
I see,

265
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,482
well, if you don't have anything,
where else could I try?

266
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,852
You are the owner, I presume?

267
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,221
Number Eight.

268
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:14,931
Uh, thank you.

269
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,768
That man who was smiling, who is he?

270
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,870
Oh, just someone who smiles.

271
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:27,911
We're pretty friendly people
here in Purgatory City.

272
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:32,109
We prefer someone who smiles at us,
especially if he's carrying a gun.

273
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,676
But when a fellah
who looks like the spit

274
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:37,687
and image of Beauregard Bennet
rides into town,

275
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:42,125
carrying a gun and not smiling,

276
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,718
then we begin to worry.

277
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,282
Where can I find a fellah
called Aaron Chase?

278
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,554
Nobody knows?

279
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,888
I'm talking to you.
I know he lives around here.

280
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:25,026
He do and he don't, Mr. Bennet.

281
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,350
You see that! Now Briggs is
taking him to see Williams.

282
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,776
And who's Williams?

283
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:45,151
Why, I'm just an ordinary citizen who's
preoccupied about one of our problems here,

284
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:50,150
You see, Bennet, for months now in
Purgatoy City we've had a terrible time.

285
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,229
A certain Sam Taylor

286
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:56,130
has hired a bunch of gunmen and
murderers and with this gang's support

287
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:59,135
he's managed to gain control of
the entire community.

288
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,228
Listen, I only came here

289
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:04,866
because your man said you'd tell me
where I could find my friend Aaron.

290
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:08,708
Outside, Briggs,

291
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:10,440
The two things are connected.

292
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,948
You see, Taylor controls the sheriff
and the sheriff controls your friend.

293
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:14,752
In jail?

294
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:19,813
That's right. But you won't find him in
the local jail. He's really well-hidden.

295
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,721
and I know their hiding-place.

296
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:22,417
So what?

297
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,358
So, one good turn deserves another.

298
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:27,363
You restore freedom in Purgatory City.

299
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:30,593
In return, I promise the freedom
of your friend Aaron,

300
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,693
plus a little sum from my fellow-citizens

301
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:36,501
as an expression of gratitude:
say, five thousand dollars.

302
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,274
They put a small price on gratitude.

303
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:40,844
Very well, will you accept
if I double it?

304
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,211
Muy bien.

305
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:45,441
Taylor is out of town.

306
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,485
He's not due till tomorrow.
You should take advantage of that.

307
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:49,450
Take advantage of it?

308
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:53,752
Get rid his gang before he comes back,
Now be careful. Don't get me wrong.

309
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:57,021
This is a peaceful city.
You must avoid a massacre.

310
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,655
Whoa, In a case like this,

311
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,494
the only person you kill
is the boss and that breaks up the gang.

312
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,362
Do you know who leads them?

313
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:08,770
Oh yes. Reagon. That hombre's a
mad killer, extremely dangerous.

314
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:12,240
But, Bennet, what are you
planning to do?

315
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:22,075
You know best, I'm sure. You're the
expert but remember, Mr. Bennet,

316
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:23,778
one only one.

317
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:37,600
Sorry, Senora Reagon,
nothing personal. Just business.

318
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:51,481
Howdy, sheriff.

319
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,783
I need your help, amigo.

320
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:05,823
I got a list here of people
who have to leave town within an hour.

321
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,467
Why, there's my name!

322
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:13,936
"I want you all out of town
within the hour,"

323
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:19,772
"And if you're not, I'll come and get you
one by one." Those were his very words.

324
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:24,144
What a man!

325
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:28,412
Yes, and I never expected this.
It shows nobility of character.

326
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,477
But where are the others?

327
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:31,555
There aren't any.

328
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,518
What's that? He's alone?

329
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:37,560
Yes.

330
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,074
Hello.

331
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:55,736
Thought you'd left by now.

332
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:59,647
Mm, not yet. My train doesn't pull out
for at least a couple more hours.

333
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:01,641
I'm just killing time.

334
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:08,456
Anyway, if they see there're
two of us, they'll think twice.

335
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:11,458
No thanks.

336
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,760
If any shooting starts,
you'd be right in my way.

337
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,871
Professor, you know what you should do.

338
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,577
You should keep out of this. Understand.

339
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,280
Go and get your train.

340
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:36,186
You better go back home right now, Brad.

341
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:58,205
Mr. Williams!

342
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,276
What do you want, Briggs?
I wish you wouldn't bother me right now.

343
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,203
But Mr. Taylor's here.

344
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:05,072
Taylor!

345
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,512
Well, bring him in at once.

346
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,248
Excuse my clothes.

347
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,250
Naturally I was greeted with the news
the minute that I arrived.

348
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,255
There was no time for me to change.

349
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:20,331
No need to apologize.
You're the boss around here, eh?

350
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:23,867
But I hear that the fellow you
got working for you now is actually

351
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,196
Beauregard Bennet.

352
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:27,696
Bennet, yes.

353
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,705
However,
your boys are all real smart.

354
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:33,004
Of course.
This should be most interesting.

355
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,576
You have a beautiful view from here.

356
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:37,009
Excellent.

357
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,912
Briggs, another chair.

358
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,285
Ah, I believe the performance
is about to begin,

359
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:25,685
Here we are.
On time like I promised you.

360
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:29,289
And now me and the boys'll be
on our way nice and quiet.

361
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:32,696
But I gotta say one thing:

362
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,139
the folks in this town sure
are ungrateful.

363
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,431
We tried to help them
and look how they treat us.

364
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:39,066
Stay where you are.

365
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:44,038
Hey, you scared? What's the matter?
See, my gun's over there.

366
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,382
I, I only want to return this star.

367
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:49,248
Thanks.

368
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:55,979
Buenas dias, Aaron.

369
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,951
What do you say
we look up some of the boys?

370
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:02,551
Sure, Beau.

371
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:07,462
Will you sign my notebook.
Professor Fletcher?

372
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,328
Reckon you put paid to quite a few,
eh, Professor?

373
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:10,957
Do you always shoot'em in the front?

374
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:12,899
You got a price on your head, too?

375
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,905
Why don't you stay here. You'd make a
better sheriff than the one we got now.

376
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,673
Have a good trip, Professor!
And forget the West!

377
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,081
Vamos!

378
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:33,882
All aboard!

379
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:39,824
Hey you! That's my horse!

380
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:43,196
Wait, wait! I'm coming with you!

381
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,466
You better not do anything rash, friend,

382
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,198
that fellah's a gunman.
He works for Beauregard Bennet.

383
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:05,010
Hey, Vance, you see him. That's Brad.

384
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,983
He's smarter than the
two of you put together.

385
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:12,321
You might even I earn something.

386
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:13,689
Pleased to meet you.

387
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:15,852
Thanks, Vance. My pleasure.

388
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:19,489
Anybody know where Zachary's got to?

389
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:22,566
No, but I know where Jason is.

390
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:24,763
He had to find work.

391
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,941
Yippy!

392
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:13,474
Hey, the Professor can sure pick'em.

393
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:15,140
Gimme that.

394
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:23,893
That must be at
I east a thousand dollars.

395
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:26,360
More, more, a lot more.

396
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:30,628
"Dear Son. We managed to sell the house,
and here's the money for you.

397
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:34,836
Don't mind about us.

398
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,666
Your Ma and me are pretty old.
Old people don't need very much.

399
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:39,374
All we care about is you."

400
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:40,569
Shut up, Brad!

401
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,708
I can read another.
There're more.

402
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,087
Shut up, I said!

403
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:57,785
Of course it might make you begin to
think and that would be terrible for you.

404
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:01,820
If you want to leave, I don't mind.

405
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:05,329
I wish I could.

406
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:10,833
But I've burnt my bridges too soon,
I have no choice now.

407
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,031
Beauregard,

408
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:44,365
Beau, but I've been so worried about you.

409
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:45,635
Howdy, Belle.

410
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,012
This is Brad Fletcher.

411
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:50,671
Madam.

412
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:53,913
The others?

413
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,210
They'll get here.
Where's your brother?

414
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,814
He's out after a runaway slave.
Ah dear Mr. Fletcher is from the North.

415
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:02,984
You looked worried hearing me say "slave".

416
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,195
I suppose yo'd prefer the word "servant".
But a word doesn't change anything.

417
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:11,792
Nobody'll ever make us change, not even this
Lincoln,

418
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:16,396
our emancipator. Your pardon, Mr. Fletcher,
even if you're a Yankee,

419
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:19,965
because you came here with our
Beauregard and you're a gentleman too.

420
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:22,813
But don't blush.

421
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:29,013
We're happy to have you as a guest here, in
the ancestral mansion of the De Winton's.

422
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:33,384
I propose Beauregard,
long may he remain with us;

423
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:37,319
and I propose Zachary,
may his days in jail be short.

424
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:40,158
And I propose Bennet's Raiders,
about to ride again!

425
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:41,253
And I propose the South!

426
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:42,764
With your permission, Fletcher.

427
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:46,325
At the De Winton's?
Sure of that, boy?

428
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,428
Of course I'm sure; real sure,
Sheriff. You know why?

429
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:52,999
Miss Belle keep call in' him Beau
an Mister Max call him Bennet.

430
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:54,633
Forget it.

431
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:55,871
Forget what?

432
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,014
I said Forget about Bennet.

433
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:00,917
Get out. Boy! You're joking, Siringo.

434
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,816
I can prove anything that Max De Winton
is working with Bennet's Raiders,

435
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,286
and capture Beau himself.

436
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:10,850
And collect a big fat
reward for yourself,

437
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,333
but all the same, you should forget it.

438
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:21,660
You Pinkerton's men all think
you're something special, don't you?

439
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:25,674
Yes sir. You got money, a good job,
connections in the government.

440
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:28,074
You think you can get away with
anything, but

441
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,079
you can't give orders to a sheriff.

442
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:40,079
Try to understand. Sheriff.

443
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,991
Look, I've had several chances
to catch Beauregard.

444
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:44,890
I've been following him for months.

445
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:47,054
But I haven't done it

446
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:51,225
because he's been trying to round up
some of his former friends.

447
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:54,427
When they're all together

448
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:57,871
that'll be the time to arrest Beauregard
and his whole gang with him.

449
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:00,443
And put an end to
Bennet's Raiders for good.

450
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:02,739
Smart plan you cooked up, Siringo.

451
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:05,940
Only Beauregard Bennet is going
to be my prisoner, Mister.

452
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:10,152
I'm going to De Winton's to arrest him.
And you'd better keep out of my way!

453
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:16,126
Yep, I better keep out of your way.

454
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:21,391
I know this isn't very inciting for you,
talking with me here all evening but

455
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,701
there's something I really have
to show you, something very dear to me.

456
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:34,204
That's part of
a Confederate Cavalry scarf.

457
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:36,910
That's right. I gave it to my fiance

458
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:42,508
before he left for Gettysburg.

459
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:47,079
Gettysburg. You have my sympathy.

460
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:52,290
It was the only time
I've been in love, that once.

461
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,397
To have been in love once is
something to be thankful for.

462
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:02,235
Not everyone is that fortunate.

463
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:06,974
This is the only memento I have now.

464
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:12,841
Belle.

465
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:17,414
Listen, old girl, don't begin
that old story again.

466
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:21,753
You know it only makes you sad. Then I
have to work so hard to cheer you up.

467
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:26,228
Mister Bennet, would you please
leave this room. Yours is next door.

468
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:30,960
As usual, no? With the
connecting door. What's wrong?

469
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,435
Oh, I get it.

470
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:40,065
You don't want him to know.
It'd make a bad... impression, eh?

471
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:45,879
But you don't have to worry Belle.
Brad's a gentleman.

472
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:48,247
Aren't you, Brad?

473
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:51,378
I suppose I must be. So far.

474
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,315
But, ah,

475
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,259
I think I'm learning.

476
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:01,056
I already told you, Beauregard, I'd
never be too far away to hear you.

477
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:09,264
But for all I know it might have been
you who told the sheriff that I was here.

478
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,241
Forget it. If it was me though,
would I warn you now.

479
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,469
Maybe.

480
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:16,939
I wanna think about it.

481
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,518
Hold it, Bennet! Don't move!

482
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:31,459
You too. Max!

483
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:37,726
Everyone stay where you are! We've got
you all covered! Don't move, I said.

484
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,471
Unfasten your gunbelts real slow and
don't make any mistakes!

485
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:58,518
Siringo, my instinct warns me
not to have faith in a man like you,

486
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:02,185
but the Professor here says
don't trust your instincts, he says.

487
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:04,860
The brain is really all that matters

488
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:12,526
and it will consider
true whatever the eyes see.

489
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:18,572
All right, boys,
this here's Charlie Siringo.

490
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:24,475
He's with us.

491
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:35,725
Puerta de Fuego.

492
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,193
Beau!

493
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,590
Welcome home, Beau. We been doing a
heap of worrying about you.

494
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,037
I know who you're looking for, but

495
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:29,672
Zachary ain't arrived. Sure as shootin'
the vigilantes

496
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:33,436
bushwacked him on the trail and
God knows where the took him.

497
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:35,672
Bourbon.

498
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:37,639
Thanks.

499
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,502
Your memory's sure deserted you.
Don't you recall Annie?

500
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:12,142
She's all skin and bones, that little girl,
that's what you used to say last year.

501
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:12,840
Sure, sure, Annie,

502
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,714
and you're still the same little girl,
just as skinny, just as bony.

503
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:24,950
How about a kiss for me? Growing, eh,
last year you were all knees.

504
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:26,552
And I still got knees, see?!

505
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:51,136
Not dancing?

506
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:14,537
You mind going away so I can finally
have a little peace and quiet.

507
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:17,437
You kids should all be
in bed taking a siesta.

508
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:22,668
Baby's willing if you're ready
to rockabye your little baby.

509
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:24,940
You ought to be spanked;
you're a child not a grown-up!

510
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:26,675
And you know what you are?
You're a prissy son of a...

511
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:30,150
Shut your dirty little mouth,
hear?! You!

512
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:15,089
Wanta?

513
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:16,763
No, don't know how.

514
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:23,601
Talking about me in town?
How much reward they offering for me now?

515
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:27,103
Come on, Rusty. What do you mean reward?

516
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,940
Who do you think's looking for
you after thirty years?

517
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,041
Mean they forgot me? Why the whole
west knew who... Rusty Rogers was.

518
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,448
You said Rusty Rogers?

519
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:38,613
Is that you?

520
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:43,824
You, you mean
you heard of me, stranger?

521
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:45,758
But... surely you're joking.
Why you're a legend.

522
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:47,124
Your name is so famous
I didn't really believe you existed.

523
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:50,097
I thought you'd been invented
as a symbol of the wild west,

524
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,600
a figment of the public imagination.

525
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:56,194
Why, composers have written
whole ballads around you.

526
00:52:56,306 --> 00:53:01,107
Well, as for you reward,
it's gone on up until it's now

527
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:04,006
your worth five thousand dollars.

528
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:08,445
No, i'm wrong;
it's gone up to ten thousand dollars.

529
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:10,808
It's true?

530
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:15,881
Thank you, I sure do thank you,
Mister. Yippee!

531
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:24,122
Old Rusty.
A ghost out of the past.

532
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,662
If I've been able to breathe a little new
life into him, it means I'm still alive.

533
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:29,864
In that case you'll have
plenty of work here.

534
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,302
All of us in Puerto de
Fuego are ghosts of the past.
