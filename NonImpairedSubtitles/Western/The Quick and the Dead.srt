1
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:25,353
50 feet north of the wagon.

2
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:29,639
Or was it 50 feet
south of the wagon?

3
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:33,430
I can't remember.

4
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:03,793
You ain't gonna take my gold.
No, sir!

5
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:31,630
Asshole.

6
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:39,194
I'm gonna kill you, bitch.

7
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:46,795
Damn you!

8
00:02:46,961 --> 00:02:53,912
Don't you leave me here. I'm gonna
kill you if I ever see you again.

9
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:57,994
I'm gonna kill you, bitch!

10
00:04:00,201 --> 00:04:02,795
MARSHAL

11
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:31,429
5'8". Am I right?

12
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:35,150
I ain't ever wrong.

13
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:36,398
That's a girl. Thanks.

14
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:46,230
- How about a room?
- Whores next door.

15
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:53,350
- Say that again.
- Whores next door.

16
00:06:03,241 --> 00:06:06,199
Now, do you have a room available?

17
00:06:06,361 --> 00:06:09,876
A room and bath.
Yes, ma'am. Coming up.

18
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:15,035
Katie, let's go get the lady a room
and a bath.

19
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,312
Barkeep,
I want a bottle of champagne.

20
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:43,475
And don't you dare open it.
I want to know what I'm drinking.

21
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:51,679
- You want to play poker with me?
- You keep playing with yourself.

22
00:06:51,841 --> 00:06:54,480
This is a very special pack.

23
00:06:54,641 --> 00:06:59,032
I put an ace in it
every time I kill a man.

24
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:19,834
Interested in first-class whisky?
Fine cigars, lndian ink, or perfume?

25
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:23,960
Just shine my boots.

26
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:33,630
John Herod owns that house. He gets
50 cents of every dollar in town.

27
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:38,192
- What does the town get?
- They get to live.

28
00:07:40,841 --> 00:07:45,153
Another gun in town.

29
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,231
Hi, Scars.

30
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:06,518
Stand back.

31
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:41,479
That makes ...15.

32
00:08:57,801 --> 00:09:02,397
- I just got out of prison.
- Congratulations.

33
00:09:02,561 --> 00:09:06,713
- I got 35 years, but got out early.
- How long did you do this time?

34
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:10,430
Three days.

35
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:14,037
- You're pretty.
- You're not.

36
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:19,229
- I need a woman.
- You need a bath.

37
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:31,035
I'm so clumsy, I must be blind.

38
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:43,237
- We prayed you'd come to help us.
- This is strictly business.

39
00:09:43,401 --> 00:09:49,078
- These candelabras are worth $200.
- That's not good enough.

40
00:09:49,241 --> 00:09:52,153
Is that it?

41
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:12,233
Don't mind my daddy.
He's just stupid.

42
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:17,759
You look like you've been riding
a long time. Where are you from?

43
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:22,836
Are you here for the contest?
I've never seen a woman carry a gun.

44
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:26,914
If you're a good shot,
maybe you could ...

45
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:33,313
I guess I'd better go now.

46
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:39,396
Gold teeth!
I've got all sizes. Gold teeth.

47
00:11:39,561 --> 00:11:43,679
I've got uppers. I've got lowers.
You're wasting my time.

48
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:48,873
Quiet!

49
00:11:50,321 --> 00:11:54,951
I now declare
the quick-draw competition open.

50
00:11:55,121 --> 00:12:00,434
Each man who enters the contest
will fight once a day.

51
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:07,871
Anybody can challenge anybody.
Fight times to be drawn from a hat.

52
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:11,636
For the duration of the contest -

53
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:18,957
- fighters are entitled to whatever
they want, courtesy of Mr. Herod.

54
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:23,239
But the man who wins the contest
gets this ...

55
00:12:23,401 --> 00:12:28,634
$123,000!

56
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:33,079
Compliments of Mr. Herod
and Wells-Fargo.

57
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:37,029
All right, gentlemen,
what do you say?

58
00:12:37,201 --> 00:12:41,319
Do we have any real gunmen
in this room?

59
00:12:41,481 --> 00:12:45,315
- Do we?
- Yes.

60
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:51,711
Gutzon.

61
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:57,274
- I am the Swedish champion.
- Mr. Gutzon is the first to go up.

62
00:12:57,881 --> 00:12:59,872
Anyone else?

63
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:05,513
- Put an ace up there for me.
- Ace Hanlon.

64
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:09,959
You'd better put me
and my friend Eugene on the list.

65
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:12,919
I ain't joining no contest.

66
00:13:13,081 --> 00:13:18,155
Did I hear a clucking? Did somebody
bring a chicken in here?

67
00:13:18,321 --> 00:13:23,349
- I'll kill you with my bare hands.
- No, it's a gunfight.

68
00:13:23,521 --> 00:13:26,797
We aim, we fire, you die.
You'll get the idea.

69
00:13:26,961 --> 00:13:29,873
The fighting begins tomorrow.

70
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:33,113
- Put my name up there.
- Anybody else?

71
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:36,717
- Sergeant Cantrell.
- How do you spell that?

72
00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:42,838
Correctly.

73
00:13:43,001 --> 00:13:45,754
- Anyone else?
- Spotted Horse.

74
00:13:45,921 --> 00:13:49,630
Many white men will leave this town
in wooden boxes.

75
00:13:49,801 --> 00:13:52,440
Spotted Horse. Any others?

76
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:56,913
- Put my damn name up.
- Scars.

77
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:05,677
I'm worth $3,000 in four states.
75 offences and no convictions.

78
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:11,632
My name's Fee ...
but everyone calls me The Kid.

79
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:15,077
Congratulations.

80
00:14:17,281 --> 00:14:22,355
I can wake up at dawn, rob two
banks, a train, a stagecoach, -

81
00:14:22,521 --> 00:14:26,355
- shoot the feathers
off a duck's ass at 300 feet, -

82
00:14:26,521 --> 00:14:32,357
- and be back in bed before you
wake up next to me. How are you?

83
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:38,710
- Just fine.
- Virgil Sparks, the pride of Texas.

84
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:44,433
Horace said you drink this.
You sure must want to die young.

85
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:47,240
I do now.

86
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:51,321
We've got a lot of spaces here.
Let's fill 'em up, men.

87
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:55,394
We've got a lot of spaces here.
Let's fill 'em up, men.

88
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:37,280
- How many brave men do we got?
- 12, Mr. Herod.

89
00:15:37,441 --> 00:15:41,673
13 if you count Foy,
but he and Ratsy aren't back yet.

90
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:46,596
They'll be here. They're just
running a little errand for me.

91
00:15:56,321 --> 00:16:00,553
- Add my name to the list.
- Yes, sir.

92
00:16:18,121 --> 00:16:23,149
- We beat the hell out of him.
- He ain't nothing.

93
00:16:25,321 --> 00:16:30,236
Hello, Cort. I was beginning to
worry you wouldn't make it in time.

94
00:16:30,401 --> 00:16:35,316
It's been a while. I hear you have
a mission down in Hermosillo.

95
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:39,315
Is that right?
Your own little piece of heaven.

96
00:16:39,481 --> 00:16:45,351
Sunshine, cactus flowers
and you and the orphan children.

97
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:49,639
We burned that mission down,
just like you said.

98
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,440
All that work, Cort ...

99
00:16:52,601 --> 00:16:58,551
All those years of hard work
destroyed for no reason.

100
00:16:58,721 --> 00:17:04,671
It must make you angry.
You used to be fast.

101
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:09,033
Are you still fast?

102
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:12,989
Don't I get an answer?

103
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:16,870
Have you taken a vow of silence?

104
00:17:18,201 --> 00:17:22,240
I said, are you still fast?

105
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:25,473
Faster than you.

106
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:32,670
But I have renounced violence.

107
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:35,514
We'll see.

108
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:40,516
String him up.
In here, on the chair.

109
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:48,434
Adjust your collar, Reverend.

110
00:17:52,001 --> 00:17:55,880
Pull him up, Foy.

111
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:11,551
Let me make it clear ...
I want you in that contest.

112
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:13,916
No.

113
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:24,993
Think about it.

114
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,880
Last chance.

115
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:48,398
- Yes or no?
- Go to hell.

116
00:18:53,281 --> 00:18:56,557
Sign me up.

117
00:18:56,721 --> 00:19:01,795
- No women in quick-draw.
- There's no rules against ladies.

118
00:19:01,961 --> 00:19:05,920
It's just that women
can't shoot for shit.

119
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:11,360
Adios, Reverend.

120
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:33,636
Put 'em both in the contest.

121
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:37,032
Move it, Preacher.

122
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:40,876
Take him out by the trough.

123
00:20:12,561 --> 00:20:15,394
- Come back here.
- No!

124
00:20:15,561 --> 00:20:19,270
Come back here! You hear me?

125
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:22,911
Daddy!

126
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:42,600
Good morning. You definitely
had a good time last night.

127
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:48,996
Want some breakfast? Or how about
some more of what we had last night?

128
00:20:49,161 --> 00:20:53,393
You certainly won
that drinking contest.

129
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:57,793
But then again, I won you in poker.

130
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:05,394
You puked and passed out,
so let's not plan the wedding yet.

131
00:21:06,201 --> 00:21:12,800
- Why do you sleep on this thing?
- That way nobody will steal it.

132
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:17,158
DYNAMITE

133
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:22,032
- Who are you gonna challenge today?
- Herod.

134
00:21:22,201 --> 00:21:30,074
Bad idea. I'm the only guy who can
take him and I ain't gonna rush it.

135
00:21:30,241 --> 00:21:36,760
- Why not?
- Hell, he's my father.

136
00:22:24,561 --> 00:22:27,553
Have you been challenged yet?

137
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:31,919
You have now. I'll go get us a time.

138
00:22:32,081 --> 00:22:36,279
These are my boys.
They don't get to church much.

139
00:22:36,441 --> 00:22:39,797
Daddy's gonna kill you, Preacher.

140
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:59,954
- Sleep well?
- Not as well as you.

141
00:23:00,121 --> 00:23:06,435
- I saved your life last night.
- You just stretched it out a bit.

142
00:23:06,601 --> 00:23:10,480
- I might already be in heaven.
- Sorry.

143
00:23:20,241 --> 00:23:24,917
- Don't you even want to fight back?
- Of course I do.

144
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:28,676
I'd like to kill them all
for what they've done ... but I won't.

145
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:34,916
- Killing people is wrong.
- Some people deserve to die.

146
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:43,791
It was a little lean this week.
The whisky was flat.

147
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:48,477
Horace, your excuses
are getting worse every week.

148
00:23:48,641 --> 00:23:54,238
I took everything
out of the register, sir.

149
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:58,440
- That's all there was.
- Barkeep ...

150
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:24,871
I challenge you ...

151
00:24:25,521 --> 00:24:30,117
- I'm not fighting you.
- You ain't got no choice.

152
00:24:30,281 --> 00:24:34,797
- I told you!
- What are you doing here?

153
00:24:34,961 --> 00:24:39,239
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here for the money.

154
00:24:39,401 --> 00:24:43,519
The rules say
you have to accept every challenge.

155
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:47,594
If you've got a problem with that,
get out of town.

156
00:24:47,761 --> 00:24:51,640
- I've got no problem.
- The lady fights Mr. Kelly.

157
00:24:51,801 --> 00:24:55,555
They fight at seven o'clock tonight.

158
00:25:14,201 --> 00:25:17,591
- Pick a card, honey.
- Thank you.

159
00:25:26,921 --> 00:25:30,197
He's so hot.

160
00:25:30,361 --> 00:25:33,319
Hold it up.

161
00:25:41,281 --> 00:25:43,317
Ace of spades.

162
00:25:47,281 --> 00:25:50,432
Thank you.

163
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:56,278
I heard you blew a little girl's
thumb off in Reno doing that.

164
00:25:56,961 --> 00:26:01,637
- I'm the best you'll ever see.
- So I keep hearing.

165
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:05,680
Shall we find out?

166
00:26:54,401 --> 00:26:58,110
Look, girls, there he is.

167
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:19,271
It's lights out, Kid.

168
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:24,640
I'm gonna be pissing on your grave
tonight. You're through!

169
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:34,314
Quiet!

170
00:27:36,161 --> 00:27:39,676
- What's the odds on The Kid?
- Three to one.

171
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:45,120
Gentlemen, remember,
you must not draw -

172
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:52,835
- until that clock
makes the first chime of the hour.

173
00:27:53,001 --> 00:27:56,232
What if somebody gets excited
and starts shooting early?

174
00:27:57,761 --> 00:28:01,436
Any cheats
will be eliminated from the contest.

175
00:28:07,161 --> 00:28:11,279
Whoever is standing after the draw
is the winner.

176
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:19,633
If both men are still standing,
you must continue firing.

177
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:23,589
Gentlemen, the street is yours.

178
00:28:28,161 --> 00:28:31,073
I'll only wound you, Kid.

179
00:28:31,241 --> 00:28:34,438
You're a kind man.

180
00:28:57,801 --> 00:29:01,350
Damn, am I fast!

181
00:29:01,521 --> 00:29:04,718
Did you even see me, I was so fast?

182
00:29:07,201 --> 00:29:12,958
Mr. Swedish Champion, are you done?
Stay down if you're finished.

183
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:16,719
Yes, I give up.

184
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:24,954
- The Kid's the winner.
- Am I fast or is Sweden very small?

185
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:41,517
Come on, Kid, I'm gonna
get you something to drink.

186
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,193
How does it feel, Cort?

187
00:29:46,361 --> 00:29:51,310
Does it remind you
of the good old days?

188
00:29:51,481 --> 00:29:56,601
Is your heart beating faster?
ls your pulse racing?

189
00:29:59,961 --> 00:30:04,034
- Good shooting, Kid.
- Good shooting?

190
00:30:06,081 --> 00:30:11,474
If the Swede had been any slower,
birds would've nested in his hat.

191
00:30:11,641 --> 00:30:14,553
Come on, Kid.

192
00:30:17,601 --> 00:30:23,153
Spotted Horse cannot be killed
by a bullet. See.

193
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:30,716
Four bullets in my arm, three in
my left leg and two in the back.

194
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:36,751
Another bullet went through my lip.
Another through my left foot.

195
00:30:36,921 --> 00:30:42,154
Today a bullet went into my head
and it's not even come out yet!

196
00:32:37,761 --> 00:32:41,276
- It's time.
- I'm not gonna fight.

197
00:32:46,161 --> 00:32:49,392
You don't want to fight?
We'll see about that.

198
00:32:49,561 --> 00:32:55,670
Get up! Come on,
don't keep Mr. Herod waiting.

199
00:32:56,481 --> 00:32:59,678
Come on, Preacher, move it.

200
00:32:59,841 --> 00:33:04,835
- Turn the other cheek, Preacher.
- Kick his ass!

201
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:08,232
He's gonna forgive us all.

202
00:33:12,401 --> 00:33:16,679
And that concludes
the lessons for today.

203
00:33:18,881 --> 00:33:19,441
- My nose!
- I'm shocked.

204
00:33:19,441 --> 00:33:22,478
- My nose!
- I'm shocked.

205
00:33:22,641 --> 00:33:27,112
- The reverend needs a gun.
- There's plenty of other gun shops.

206
00:33:27,281 --> 00:33:32,401
- Nowhere as cheap.
- No place is cheap enough for you.

207
00:33:32,561 --> 00:33:37,681
Your mouth gets faster every day.
Pity your hands are so slow.

208
00:33:37,841 --> 00:33:43,916
- I ain't got slow hands.
- Put your hand on the counter.

209
00:33:44,081 --> 00:33:48,233
Put your gun hand on the counter.

210
00:33:50,641 --> 00:33:56,671
See, Cort. Here's a gunfighter's
hand, and here's a farmer's hand.

211
00:33:56,841 --> 00:33:59,480
I ain't got a farmer's hand.

212
00:33:59,641 --> 00:34:05,398
Cort and me are killers,
the genuine article, but you ...

213
00:34:05,561 --> 00:34:08,951
You're from different stock.

214
00:34:09,121 --> 00:34:13,319
My friend here needs a gun.

215
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:24,239
This is the Eagle-butt Peacemaker.
Solid ivory handle.

216
00:34:24,401 --> 00:34:27,598
Only 30 of these were ever made.

217
00:34:28,561 --> 00:34:34,079
This is the customized
Remington new model.

218
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:41,033
It's more accurate than the Colt.
The handles are solid silver.

219
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:48,594
Used with great success on
35 bank robberies by its late owner.

220
00:34:53,481 --> 00:35:00,478
This is the best help a man can get.
A Smith & Wesson Schofield .45.

221
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:06,318
Me and Jesse James think
it's the best handgun in the world.

222
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:09,871
Trigger guard removal
saves drawing time.

223
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:13,431
But if you're drunk,
you'll kill your feet.

224
00:35:14,081 --> 00:35:19,155
- When did you last hold a gun?
- You know when.

225
00:35:19,321 --> 00:35:24,554
I got offered 120 for this Colt.
You want to try it out?

226
00:35:29,201 --> 00:35:34,639
- Have you got $120, Cort?
- I don't have any money.

227
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:39,238
The Lord provides me
with everything I need.

228
00:35:41,361 --> 00:35:44,194
We're wasting this boy's time then.

229
00:35:44,361 --> 00:35:49,481
I'll be a good Samaritan.
What's the cheapest gun you've got?

230
00:35:49,641 --> 00:35:55,238
The cheapest piece of crap you've
got in the whole miserable store.

231
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:59,318
All right ...

232
00:36:01,441 --> 00:36:05,036
- Five bucks.
- Sold.

233
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:14,275
What are you doing?

234
00:36:14,441 --> 00:36:19,071
The Preacher's got the Lord on
his side. He only needs one bullet.

235
00:36:19,241 --> 00:36:25,032
Otherwise he might be tempted
to shoot his way out of town.

236
00:36:26,081 --> 00:36:30,632
- That gun shoots straight.
- It's okay, I won't draw.

237
00:36:30,801 --> 00:36:38,833
You will. I know you. When it comes
down to it, you'll pull the trigger.

238
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:46,355
I've got money on you, Preacher.

239
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:34,472
- I've got 20 bucks on you, Foy.
- That's money in the bank, Jimmy.

240
00:37:35,481 --> 00:37:39,076
Preacher boy, you're a dead man.

241
00:38:22,281 --> 00:38:26,320
Bless me, Lord.
Forgive me for my sins.

242
00:38:54,681 --> 00:39:00,597
- He shot me!
- You didn't lay down and die.

243
00:39:00,761 --> 00:39:04,470
You said you weren't gonna fight.

244
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:11,161
It felt natural, didn't it?
Nice and smooth.

245
00:39:15,121 --> 00:39:18,909
I thought you weren't gonna fight.

246
00:39:25,721 --> 00:39:29,999
You're pretty fast.
I hope I don't have to fight you.

247
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:34,552
- You have a choice to be here.
- He made you do it.

248
00:39:34,721 --> 00:39:38,919
I was the only one
who pulled the trigger.

249
00:39:39,081 --> 00:39:42,630
This ain't much of a town
for a preacher.

250
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:53,395
- I wasn't always a preacher.
- Cort was an outlaw. Like us.

251
00:39:53,561 --> 00:39:57,031
Weren't you?

252
00:39:57,201 --> 00:40:00,910
In fact, he used to ride with me.

253
00:40:02,881 --> 00:40:08,513
Of course, that's all changed now.
He's a man of peace.

254
00:40:08,681 --> 00:40:11,957
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

255
00:40:12,881 --> 00:40:15,554
Easy ...

256
00:40:15,721 --> 00:40:19,680
There was a time
when you couldn't tell us apart.

257
00:40:28,361 --> 00:40:31,080
Is that true?

258
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:34,233
- Is that true?
- Yes.

259
00:40:35,161 --> 00:40:38,949
I should've let you die.

260
00:40:45,881 --> 00:40:49,715
It's yours. Go ahead, take it.

261
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:52,076
You smell good.

262
00:40:59,681 --> 00:41:03,720
- What are you looking at?
- A dirty old man and a little girl.

263
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:09,160
This is a business discussion.
I'm offering her a job.

264
00:41:11,641 --> 00:41:17,352
Just make sure you wash
wherever he touches you.

265
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:28,638
One of these days, I'm gonna
have to shoot you up real good.

266
00:41:43,881 --> 00:41:49,239
Mr. Hanlon, I wanted to ask you
about lndian Wells.

267
00:41:49,401 --> 00:41:55,033
- Did that fight really take place?
- It sure did.

268
00:41:55,921 --> 00:42:01,632
- You gunned down four men?
- I had a gun in each hand.

269
00:42:01,801 --> 00:42:06,716
The truth is
I am just as good with either hand.

270
00:42:06,881 --> 00:42:13,434
You must be the fastest gun
in the West ... or the biggest liar.

271
00:42:14,161 --> 00:42:18,552
It's a pity
you weren't there to find out.

272
00:42:18,721 --> 00:42:25,479
But I was. I was the one who really
killed the Terence brothers.

273
00:42:25,641 --> 00:42:31,750
I doubt that a lying chicken-shit
like you was even in the same state.

274
00:42:43,121 --> 00:42:47,239
How about that left hand, Ace?

275
00:42:48,641 --> 00:42:53,590
How about that left-handed draw?

276
00:43:11,961 --> 00:43:16,637
Mr. Ace Hanlon,
scourge of the sagebrush.

277
00:43:18,921 --> 00:43:21,833
The terror of Tucson.

278
00:43:24,721 --> 00:43:26,916
A bladder full of hot air.

279
00:44:57,241 --> 00:44:59,709
Daddy!

280
00:45:07,201 --> 00:45:11,717
String him up! Put him on a chair.

281
00:45:12,481 --> 00:45:15,473
Daddy!

282
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:27,431
They're calling for you
on the street.

283
00:45:28,001 --> 00:45:33,553
Are you really gonna do it?
What if you get killed?

284
00:45:33,721 --> 00:45:37,873
Then I won't have to answer
any more of your dumb questions.

285
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:41,158
- Miss ...
- What?

286
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:44,313
You can do it.

287
00:45:58,161 --> 00:46:03,315
There's a click before the strike.
Listen to the clock.

288
00:46:28,201 --> 00:46:31,796
The last fight of the day.

289
00:46:31,961 --> 00:46:34,919
Fire at the first chime.

290
00:46:35,081 --> 00:46:38,517
You're gonna die now, girl.

291
00:46:40,641 --> 00:46:43,758
You're dead meat.

292
00:46:43,921 --> 00:46:50,315
Look at you. Are you scared?
You're trembling like a leaf.

293
00:47:01,161 --> 00:47:06,440
There's a click before the strike.
Listen to the clock.

294
00:47:50,401 --> 00:47:52,961
The lady is the winner.

295
00:47:54,441 --> 00:47:57,558
- Damn!
- Come back here.

296
00:48:17,521 --> 00:48:22,037
Quick-firing resumes
tomorrow at noon.

297
00:48:22,201 --> 00:48:26,797
- I think you're great.
- Grow up.

298
00:48:26,961 --> 00:48:29,521
Thanks.

299
00:48:50,201 --> 00:48:51,998
DINNER TONIGHT
JOHN HEROD

300
00:49:33,081 --> 00:49:35,993
Thirsty?

301
00:49:36,161 --> 00:49:39,949
No need to go to all that trouble
just for me.

302
00:49:40,121 --> 00:49:45,275
Last night The Kid.Tonight Herod.
You're a busy woman.

303
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:49,559
- Any man you're not interested in?
- Yeah, you.

304
00:50:13,281 --> 00:50:17,479
You're looking at me and thinking:
We have nothing in common.

305
00:50:17,641 --> 00:50:22,078
But we do. We're both winners.

306
00:50:22,241 --> 00:50:25,472
How do you feel
after surviving your first day?

307
00:50:25,641 --> 00:50:29,839
- The same as yesterday.
- No. Your eyes are shining.

308
00:50:30,001 --> 00:50:35,075
You've passed a test.
You feel alive.

309
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:40,998
I guess it doesn't excite me
as much as it does you.

310
00:50:43,761 --> 00:50:46,753
You think I do this contest
because it's fun?

311
00:50:46,921 --> 00:50:51,551
Look at this town. These people
would kill you for your bootlaces.

312
00:50:51,721 --> 00:50:57,751
This way I get to face my enemies.
They can't shoot me in the back.

313
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:04,110
- And of course I always win.
- One day your luck will run out.

314
00:51:04,281 --> 00:51:07,398
I don't win because I'm lucky.

315
00:51:07,561 --> 00:51:10,359
Apres vous.

316
00:51:32,401 --> 00:51:36,394
- Why did you come here tonight?
- You invited me.

317
00:51:36,561 --> 00:51:40,440
You could've turned me down.

318
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:47,159
- I wanted to see what you're like.
- What kind of man am l?

319
00:51:48,681 --> 00:51:51,514
The kind people hate.

320
00:51:54,761 --> 00:52:01,030
I'm not trying to be popular.
The people in this town need me.

321
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:05,319
I bring a sense of order
to their lives.

322
00:52:05,481 --> 00:52:09,599
- Not law, order.
- Like hanging a preacher?

323
00:52:09,761 --> 00:52:15,154
He's no preacher. He's a fraud.

324
00:52:15,321 --> 00:52:18,313
If a man is a killer,
that's what he is.

325
00:52:18,481 --> 00:52:23,475
That same man can't tell me
it's not in his blood any more.

326
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:29,113
- He's the worst kind of liar.
- Why does he upset you so much?

327
00:52:31,201 --> 00:52:38,152
I find myself almost
uncontrollably attracted to you.

328
00:52:41,921 --> 00:52:46,551
I'd think a man like you
would have a woman.

329
00:52:47,561 --> 00:52:52,157
I was married to a beautiful woman.

330
00:52:52,321 --> 00:52:56,360
- She was unfaithful.
- Where is she now?

331
00:52:56,521 --> 00:53:00,480
I told you ... she was unfaithful.

332
00:53:06,201 --> 00:53:10,797
- Why are you really here?
- Like I said, for the money.

333
00:53:10,961 --> 00:53:13,953
I'd give you all the money you want.

334
00:53:14,121 --> 00:53:17,511
I wouldn't feel like I'd earned it.

335
00:53:17,681 --> 00:53:21,390
Yes, you would.

336
00:53:28,601 --> 00:53:32,879
- Did you ever kill anyone?
- Sure.

337
00:53:36,081 --> 00:53:43,635
I don't think so. It all comes down
to how far you're prepared to go.

338
00:53:44,761 --> 00:53:46,877
All the way.

339
00:53:52,241 --> 00:53:56,393
My father was a judge.

340
00:53:56,561 --> 00:53:59,519
That surprises you.

341
00:53:59,681 --> 00:54:05,517
He used to make my mother and me
watch people being hanged.

342
00:54:05,681 --> 00:54:09,720
One day he said there was
too much bad in this world.

343
00:54:09,881 --> 00:54:15,114
He took a bullet, put it in his gun
and spun the chamber.

344
00:54:15,281 --> 00:54:19,115
Then he took it in turns,
clicking it at each of us, -

345
00:54:19,281 --> 00:54:26,392
- until he blew the back of his
head off ... with the final click.

346
00:54:33,921 --> 00:54:40,838
Understand this: There is nothing
on this earth that frightens me now.

347
00:54:41,001 --> 00:54:45,677
- Nothing.
- I have to go.

348
00:54:47,321 --> 00:54:50,631
I shouldn't have come here.

349
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:57,075
- Who are you?
- Let me go.

350
00:55:29,481 --> 00:55:35,477
I apologize for my behaviour, but
it's hard to get a drink round here.

351
00:55:44,881 --> 00:55:49,397
I was only a kid
when I hitched up with Herod.

352
00:55:58,601 --> 00:56:02,150
He singled me out because ...

353
00:56:02,321 --> 00:56:07,076
... I was a little smarter
and a little faster than most.

354
00:56:08,081 --> 00:56:14,190
A completely fearless man, and he
wanted me to be just like him.

355
00:56:17,961 --> 00:56:23,638
We used to go revenue collecting
along the border, just the two of us.

356
00:56:23,801 --> 00:56:29,717
We took the bank in Nogales ... and
ran out to a street full of troops.

357
00:56:29,881 --> 00:56:33,112
We got shot up so bad.

358
00:56:35,161 --> 00:56:41,839
This padre hid us in his mission.
He cared for us and fed us.

359
00:56:42,001 --> 00:56:45,676
He talked to us both for hours.

360
00:56:45,841 --> 00:56:51,473
When we were strong enough to ride,
Herod told me to shoot him.

361
00:56:53,441 --> 00:56:56,956
When I said no, -

362
00:56:57,121 --> 00:57:03,230
- he put a gun to my head
and started to count down from ten.

363
00:57:09,281 --> 00:57:12,273
So I killed the priest.

364
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:18,431
It doesn't matter what I do now.
I'm already damned, I know that.

365
00:57:19,441 --> 00:57:24,720
Don't go down that road.
You don't have to become like me.

366
00:57:28,001 --> 00:57:34,440
- Why did you call me up here?
- I wanted to ask you one question.

367
00:57:34,601 --> 00:57:39,595
Who brought you here to fight me?

368
00:57:45,281 --> 00:57:48,353
Mr. Herod ...

369
00:57:48,521 --> 00:57:54,073
I'm just a gentleman adventurer
after the challenge of a gunfight.

370
00:57:55,881 --> 00:58:01,239
I thought Ace Hanlon was
the hired gun. I was so sure of it.

371
00:58:01,401 --> 00:58:05,792
But he was just a buffoon.
You're not.

372
00:58:08,041 --> 00:58:13,479
My name's Clay Cantrell,
and I'm a shootist.

373
00:58:13,641 --> 00:58:16,553
I've killed 17 men.

374
00:58:16,721 --> 00:58:21,511
Killing is purely business for me.
It doesn't give me any pleasure.

375
00:58:21,681 --> 00:58:25,833
My employer is confidential.

376
00:58:26,841 --> 00:58:30,072
Do we have business together today?

377
00:58:30,241 --> 00:58:35,315
As soon as the rain stops, I'm
going to make an example of you.

378
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:51,920
Then he said, "Give me the gun."
What could I do? I gave it to him.

379
00:58:52,081 --> 00:58:54,675
Like hell I did.

380
00:58:54,841 --> 00:59:00,837
That was it for Flat Nose Freddy.
He currently resides six feet under.

381
00:59:02,521 --> 00:59:05,513
You were brave to enter the contest.

382
00:59:05,681 --> 00:59:11,313
You've made your point.
Now I want you to step down.

383
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:14,473
I'll step down when you step down.

384
00:59:14,641 --> 00:59:20,113
I'm telling you to step down.
Your time will come.

385
00:59:20,961 --> 00:59:24,271
Not with you still around.

386
00:59:24,441 --> 00:59:27,558
Don't ever cross me.

387
00:59:27,721 --> 00:59:31,600
And don't try to stare me down
like you're doing now.

388
00:59:31,761 --> 00:59:37,791
I'm not sick or old,
and you're not half the man I am.

389
00:59:46,281 --> 00:59:48,841
Round two.

390
00:59:49,001 --> 00:59:53,791
Four fights today, featuring
the eight remaining contestants.

391
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:57,590
The winner
is the contestant left standing.

392
00:59:57,761 --> 01:00:01,959
Left alive.

393
01:00:02,121 --> 01:00:08,356
Left alive!
From now on, we fight to the death.

394
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:11,201
What a surprise, John,
you changing the rules ...

395
01:00:11,201 --> 01:00:14,113
What a surprise, John,
you changing the rules ...

396
01:00:14,281 --> 01:00:17,557
Any problem with that?

397
01:00:18,721 --> 01:00:24,079
I was planning to kill you anyway.

398
01:00:24,241 --> 01:00:28,359
Gentlemen, the street is yours.

399
01:01:12,321 --> 01:01:15,154
I'm confused.

400
01:01:15,321 --> 01:01:20,349
All I hear from you weak cowards
is how poor you are.

401
01:01:20,521 --> 01:01:23,718
How you can't afford my taxes,
my protection.

402
01:01:23,881 --> 01:01:27,920
Yet somehow you've all managed
to find the money -

403
01:01:28,081 --> 01:01:32,950
- to hire a professional gunfighter
to kill me.

404
01:01:34,881 --> 01:01:38,556
Where's all this money coming from?

405
01:01:39,601 --> 01:01:42,479
What am I to think?

406
01:01:43,721 --> 01:01:50,479
If you've got so much to spare,
I'm gonna have to take more off you.

407
01:01:50,641 --> 01:01:53,678
This is my town!

408
01:01:57,521 --> 01:02:02,549
If you live to see the dawn,
it's because I allow it.

409
01:02:02,721 --> 01:02:06,555
I'm in charge of everything.

410
01:02:07,721 --> 01:02:12,317
I decide who lives or who dies.

411
01:02:20,681 --> 01:02:23,798
Your gunfighter's dead.

412
01:02:24,481 --> 01:02:27,757
Old news.

413
01:03:01,161 --> 01:03:03,470
Is it possible?

414
01:03:03,641 --> 01:03:06,838
Is it possible
to improve on perfection?

415
01:03:07,001 --> 01:03:10,152
The man's dead.
The Kid's the winner.

416
01:03:10,321 --> 01:03:14,200
I heard him.
I heard him move his hand.

417
01:03:14,361 --> 01:03:22,678
People, I am on a different level.
I am the new mayor of this town.

418
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:27,517
- Wonderful.
- He stinks worse dead.

419
01:03:27,681 --> 01:03:34,359
Storm coming up. No more fights
till we see what it's gonna do.

420
01:03:39,001 --> 01:03:44,394
We're gonna have to bury him deep.
He stinks something awful.

421
01:04:10,521 --> 01:04:13,638
Get the hell out of here!

422
01:04:32,681 --> 01:04:38,836
That little girl
is gonna be a real good earner.

423
01:05:00,761 --> 01:05:03,878
Deal me in, boys.

424
01:05:04,041 --> 01:05:09,354
- I feel lucky.
- Was she good?

425
01:05:09,521 --> 01:05:12,513
Wriggled like a fish.

426
01:05:16,241 --> 01:05:19,551
Get up!

427
01:05:25,361 --> 01:05:31,470
- Bitch! I'll kill you.
- Outside, you bastard!

428
01:05:35,161 --> 01:05:38,597
You goddamn filthy bitch!

429
01:05:55,561 --> 01:06:01,716
Please, don't kill me.

430
01:06:06,321 --> 01:06:12,794
Finish him off! This contest
isn't over until one of you is dead.

431
01:06:12,961 --> 01:06:18,081
Please, don't kill me.

432
01:06:26,281 --> 01:06:29,717
This contest is not over yet.

433
01:06:38,601 --> 01:06:41,832
A drink.

434
01:06:42,761 --> 01:06:45,673
Thank you.

435
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:54,716
Die!

436
01:07:13,161 --> 01:07:17,712
Gold teeth.
A whole mouthful of gold teeth.

437
01:07:19,881 --> 01:07:23,669
The lady moves to round three.

438
01:07:27,241 --> 01:07:31,553
There's always forgiveness
if you ask for it.

439
01:07:53,801 --> 01:07:56,793
Come on, Preacher.

440
01:08:18,161 --> 01:08:21,915
- Thank you, Ratsy.
- Goodbye.

441
01:08:40,641 --> 01:08:46,398
What are you doing?
You're not quitting, are you?

442
01:08:46,881 --> 01:08:51,796
I know this is probably
the wrong time ...

443
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:57,194
... but I like you
and I want you to stay.

444
01:08:57,361 --> 01:09:01,559
- How can you live like this?
- Live like what?

445
01:09:01,721 --> 01:09:06,272
- Are you going to see Cort's fight?
- No, I'm not.

446
01:09:06,441 --> 01:09:12,994
I don't care about him ... or you,
or anybody else in this town.

447
01:09:16,681 --> 01:09:18,797
I'm through.

448
01:09:25,401 --> 01:09:30,873
I don't think you heard me right.
I said I liked you.

449
01:09:34,841 --> 01:09:39,198
Spotted Horse
cannot be killed by a bullet.

450
01:10:48,361 --> 01:10:52,115
The man's dead.
Cort's the winner.

451
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:55,273
He killed that lndian.

452
01:11:08,401 --> 01:11:12,758
Spotted Horse
cannot be killed by a bullet.

453
01:11:12,921 --> 01:11:17,312
- Give me another bullet.
- I explained the rules to you.

454
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:20,473
You have to kill the man.

455
01:11:23,641 --> 01:11:30,035
Give me another bullet, John.
Somebody give me a bullet!

456
01:11:31,241 --> 01:11:34,551
.38, Long Colt.

457
01:11:34,721 --> 01:11:38,157
"l shall not kill."
That's what you told me.

458
01:11:39,321 --> 01:11:43,234
- "l have renounced all violence."
- Now!

459
01:12:26,521 --> 01:12:32,551
Congratulations, you're going
to the next round, Preacher.

460
01:12:33,961 --> 01:12:37,033
Applause.

461
01:12:46,401 --> 01:12:49,677
Bravo.

462
01:12:49,841 --> 01:12:53,595
Welcome back ... killer.

463
01:12:59,001 --> 01:13:01,561
Enough.

464
01:13:05,081 --> 01:13:08,278
Give me that.

465
01:13:37,481 --> 01:13:42,191
- I knew I'd find you here.
- You know who I am?

466
01:13:42,361 --> 01:13:46,912
Of course I do.
I brought you into this world.

467
01:13:52,681 --> 01:13:56,117
- Your father ...
- I don't want to talk about it.

468
01:13:56,281 --> 01:14:01,401
You've been hours looking
for his grave. He's not here.

469
01:14:02,601 --> 01:14:07,755
Herod's men ... they smashed
the gravestone I made.

470
01:14:07,921 --> 01:14:13,120
Then they burned his body
till there was nothing left.

471
01:14:13,281 --> 01:14:20,357
There are good people here.
They're just cowards ... Iike me.

472
01:14:20,521 --> 01:14:26,198
They're waiting for someone like you
to come and stop him.

473
01:14:26,361 --> 01:14:32,311
I can't! I can't kill him!

474
01:14:32,481 --> 01:14:36,713
I had my chance and I was scared.

475
01:14:36,881 --> 01:14:43,832
- I'm scared of dying.
- You've been dead since that day.

476
01:14:44,001 --> 01:14:47,755
You're more scared of living.

477
01:14:47,921 --> 01:14:52,119
It will be the same
if you keep riding.

478
01:14:55,841 --> 01:14:59,038
I pulled this from the fire.

479
01:14:59,201 --> 01:15:02,671
He was the best friend I ever had.

480
01:15:04,881 --> 01:15:08,874
String him up. Put him on a chair.

481
01:15:10,681 --> 01:15:14,674
- Say your prayers.
- Here's the rope.

482
01:15:36,961 --> 01:15:39,475
Daddy! No!

483
01:15:42,201 --> 01:15:45,034
Put her down!

484
01:16:07,561 --> 01:16:10,280
Hey, beautiful.

485
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:13,831
What's wrong with you?

486
01:16:34,441 --> 01:16:40,755
What the hell!
That's Mr. Herod's prisoner.

487
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:47,835
I hope you don't think I've sunk
to some base level of humanity.

488
01:16:48,001 --> 01:16:53,917
The Bible speaks
of drawing a sword against evil.

489
01:16:54,081 --> 01:16:57,517
I feel that it must be God's will
that I'm here.

490
01:16:57,681 --> 01:17:02,277
So I ...

491
01:17:13,761 --> 01:17:16,912
Oh God ...

492
01:17:20,481 --> 01:17:27,796
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Because we could be dead tomorrow.

493
01:18:18,721 --> 01:18:23,841
Promise me
you'll leave Herod for me.

494
01:18:43,481 --> 01:18:46,279
I challenge you.

495
01:18:46,441 --> 01:18:51,640
I'm not fighting anybody else.
I want you.

496
01:18:51,801 --> 01:18:54,793
I've already been challenged.

497
01:18:57,601 --> 01:19:02,800
It's time for me to see
if I'm my father's equal.

498
01:19:08,081 --> 01:19:11,869
You would fight your own son.

499
01:19:12,041 --> 01:19:16,990
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Do you have a problem with me?

500
01:19:20,121 --> 01:19:23,431
I'll let you know.

501
01:19:41,481 --> 01:19:46,271
- I'm not fighting you.
- I'm not fighting you.

502
01:19:46,441 --> 01:19:49,990
I came here to kill Herod,
and that's what I'm gonna do.

503
01:19:50,161 --> 01:19:53,471
- Stand down.
- I will not.

504
01:19:53,641 --> 01:19:58,761
Stand down and let me take him
in the final. He'll be just as dead.

505
01:20:00,321 --> 01:20:03,313
Let me make something clear:

506
01:20:03,481 --> 01:20:08,350
You are going to fight.
Nobody walks out on this contest.

507
01:20:08,521 --> 01:20:12,116
You don't tell me what to do.

508
01:20:13,281 --> 01:20:18,514
If you try to leave town or refuse
to fight, my men will kill you.

509
01:20:18,681 --> 01:20:23,675
You had your chance to quit
and now it's gone.

510
01:20:40,121 --> 01:20:42,681
Clear the street!

511
01:20:42,841 --> 01:20:48,791
Round three!
Only four contestants left.

512
01:20:48,961 --> 01:20:55,150
Mr. Herod fights The Kid.
Then the lady fights Cort.

513
01:20:55,321 --> 01:20:57,312
Clear the street!

514
01:20:57,481 --> 01:21:02,157
You don't have to do this.
Everybody knows you're the best.

515
01:21:02,321 --> 01:21:06,792
It ain't about that. I'm his son.

516
01:21:06,961 --> 01:21:13,196
If this is the only way
he'll admit that ...

517
01:21:13,361 --> 01:21:16,353
... then so be it.

518
01:21:16,521 --> 01:21:22,710
What can you get out of this?
What do you want?

519
01:21:29,521 --> 01:21:33,196
All I want is his respect.

520
01:22:18,681 --> 01:22:21,991
I love you.

521
01:22:36,721 --> 01:22:40,714
Drop out. You've made your point.

522
01:22:40,881 --> 01:22:47,559
The gunfight is in the head,
not in the hands.

523
01:22:47,721 --> 01:22:54,069
The thing that makes him invincible
is that you all think he is.

524
01:22:55,361 --> 01:23:00,993
Maybe five years ago
he was the fastest ...

525
01:23:01,161 --> 01:23:04,551
... but time catches up
with everyone.

526
01:23:04,721 --> 01:23:10,910
He's just a little bit slower than
he used to be. As for myself ...

527
01:23:15,481 --> 01:23:19,076
I just reached my peak.

528
01:23:36,481 --> 01:23:39,996
Shit, that was fast!

529
01:24:10,321 --> 01:24:15,156
- Did I get him?
- Yeah, Kid, you got him.

530
01:24:15,321 --> 01:24:18,154
Did I kill him?

531
01:24:18,321 --> 01:24:23,520
- You were so fast, Kid.
- I don't want to die.

532
01:24:25,241 --> 01:24:29,234
I don't want to die.

533
01:24:34,561 --> 01:24:37,553
I know.

534
01:25:02,001 --> 01:25:06,995
It was never proved
that he was my son.

535
01:25:07,161 --> 01:25:13,509
It was a farmer that ...
He wasn't mine.

536
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:23,112
I gave him a way out.
He wouldn't take it.

537
01:26:23,521 --> 01:26:28,834
- What kind of ink do you have?
- Any kind you need.

538
01:26:30,161 --> 01:26:33,119
DYNAMITE

539
01:27:58,801 --> 01:28:03,795
If neither one of you fire
by the time I count down from ten, -

540
01:28:03,961 --> 01:28:07,192
- my men will gun you down.

541
01:28:14,201 --> 01:28:18,035
Ten ... nine ...

542
01:28:18,201 --> 01:28:22,114
- Draw your gun. He'll do it.
- Eight.

543
01:28:23,801 --> 01:28:25,837
- Seven.
- Draw!

544
01:28:26,001 --> 01:28:29,550
- Six.
- Kill me, Ellen.

545
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:33,191
- Five.
- Kill me!

546
01:28:33,361 --> 01:28:38,560
Kill me! Kill me,
or I'm gonna kill you.

547
01:28:39,481 --> 01:28:41,631
One!

548
01:29:06,481 --> 01:29:10,679
She's dead.

549
01:29:10,841 --> 01:29:16,871
She's dead! Leave her alone,
you vultures. Don't touch her!

550
01:29:17,041 --> 01:29:20,033
Nice shooting, Reverend.

551
01:29:20,201 --> 01:29:25,434
You put a fox in the hen house
and you'll have chicken for dinner.

552
01:29:25,601 --> 01:29:28,115
You're gonna burn for this.

553
01:29:28,281 --> 01:29:32,957
Is this what you wanted all along?
Come and get some.

554
01:29:38,761 --> 01:29:41,559
Son of a bitch!

555
01:29:45,441 --> 01:29:48,956
Of course we'll fight,
but the rules say tomorrow.

556
01:29:49,121 --> 01:29:53,478
- I'll even let you name the time.
- Dawn.

557
01:30:07,001 --> 01:30:09,993
Break my nose twice?

558
01:30:12,281 --> 01:30:17,275
Now we'll see how fast you can draw.

559
01:31:26,881 --> 01:31:30,476
- Who did that?
- I did that, Mr. Herod.

560
01:31:30,641 --> 01:31:34,395
You've got 20 seconds
to get out of town.

561
01:31:34,561 --> 01:31:38,679
That's not fair. I've only ever done
what you told me to.

562
01:31:38,841 --> 01:31:42,880
- You now have 15 seconds.
- Goodbye, Ratsy.

563
01:31:45,641 --> 01:31:50,954
What do you think? There's a lot of
people here that want entertainment.

564
01:31:51,121 --> 01:31:56,479
I could draw with my left hand.
How does that sound?

565
01:31:56,641 --> 01:32:00,680
Unlike Mr. Ace Hanlon,
I really can fight with both hands.

566
01:32:00,841 --> 01:32:04,072
How do you feel? I'm nervous.

567
01:32:04,241 --> 01:32:10,191
It takes a lot to scare me.
I love the sensation.

568
01:32:13,041 --> 01:32:16,875
Time's up, Ratsy!

569
01:32:21,641 --> 01:32:27,750
I always wanted to fight you, Cort.
Ever since the first time I saw you.

570
01:32:27,921 --> 01:32:33,473
It's just this itch
that I had to scratch.

571
01:32:46,001 --> 01:32:50,950
If he's still standing at the end,
gun him down.

572
01:34:54,721 --> 01:34:58,077
You're dead! You're dead!

573
01:35:27,081 --> 01:35:31,233
Sorry, John.
Changed the rules.

574
01:35:31,401 --> 01:35:36,270
- From now on all fights are fair.
- Who are you?

575
01:35:52,401 --> 01:35:55,359
You stole my life.

576
01:35:55,521 --> 01:35:59,116
Let her go, you son of a bitch!

577
01:36:04,321 --> 01:36:10,590
Don't make my little girl watch.
Let her go, before you kill me.

578
01:36:10,761 --> 01:36:14,390
I can't do that.
I've had my three shots.

579
01:36:14,561 --> 01:36:19,430
I'll give you three shots
to save your daddy's life.

580
01:36:19,601 --> 01:36:25,949
Shoot the rope, and if it breaks,
your daddy can live.

581
01:36:26,921 --> 01:36:29,913
You can do it, darling.

582
01:36:33,081 --> 01:36:36,198
- I can't.
- You can do it.

583
01:36:36,361 --> 01:36:42,516
Hold the gun in both hands
and pull the hammer back.

584
01:36:42,681 --> 01:36:47,755
- I can't.
- You can. You can do it.

585
01:36:47,921 --> 01:36:52,597
- No, I can't.
- Don't you worry about this.

586
01:36:52,761 --> 01:36:57,232
None of this is your fault.
Don't you blame yourself.

587
01:36:57,401 --> 01:37:03,670
Just remember
that your daddy loves you.

588
01:37:04,601 --> 01:37:09,629
I'll always love you ...
Just remember that. Now, come on.

589
01:37:24,041 --> 01:37:26,874
That's close enough.

590
01:37:57,601 --> 01:38:02,152
- You're not fast enough for me.
- Today I am.

591
01:39:20,921 --> 01:39:24,197
The law's come back to town.

592
01:43:18,161 --> 01:43:22,552
