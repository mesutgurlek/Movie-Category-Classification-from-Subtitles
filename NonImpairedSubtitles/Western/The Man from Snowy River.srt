1
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:03,605
No matter which way I figure it,
naught and naught still equals naught.

2
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,863
How about we get Bess in foal?
Pick up some more brood mares?

3
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,364
What with?

4
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,449
If we're going to keep this place,

5
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:18,161
we're going to have to get a job
out of the High Country.

6
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,746
Down on the flats?
Yeah.

7
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:23,500
Wouldn't be too bad,
we could hire out as a team.

8
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:27,171
Not as cooks.
Watch it.

9
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:32,801
Must be your music.

10
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,470
Alright, I'll see to it.

11
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:52,613
Hey, Bessie.

12
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,680
Steady, girl.

13
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:22,392
Whoa, Bessie.
Steady girl

14
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,894
Whoa, there, girl


15
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,188
I reckon the dingo set her off.

16
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,941
Not wild dogs...

17
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,278
..wild horses.

18
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,821
The old thoroughbred's mob.

19
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,492
It's years since
he's been this side of the ranges.

20
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:45,999
You're not going to shoot him?!
He's only going to cause us grief.

21
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,334
Run off our horses.
He's done it before.

22
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:51,004
But Dad.
There are some good horses there now.

23
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,632
They'd be worth a far bit.

24
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,218
Caught and broken, they might.

25
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,762
Well...we could do it.

26
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:02,599
Keep some for breeding, then we
wouldn't have to go and hire out.

27
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:06,520
Hold on. That horse has been running free
since the day you were born.

28
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:12,317
Craftiest animal I've ever seen.
Who better than a crafty mountain man to catch him.

29
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,654
You've got your mother's way about you, 
haven't you?

30
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:19,658
We could build a holding hard,
up on the flats spur and drive them in.

31
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,243
No, I don't think so.

32
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,412
We'll yard them on Kelly's Track.

33
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:45,137
Come on! Get up!

34
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:50,517
Come on.

35
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,478
Whoa, there. Good boy.

36
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:57,024
Come on. Get up!

37
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,776
Good boy.

38
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:03,197
Looks like we're building a fort,
not a holding yard.

39
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,408
When we drop this across the track,
they'll never get out.

40
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:20,047
Bes!

41
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,632
Jim, the gelding!

42
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,512
Dad!

43
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,526
Are you OK?

44
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:46,490
I should've put a bullet in that stallion.
I'll get you down to Spurs' place.

45
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:52,412


46
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:04,967
Here...( Sigh )

47
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:09,721
The gelding's broken his leg.
We'll have to put him down.

48
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,852
Where's Bess?
She ran off with the brumbies.

49
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:18,063
Oh, Spur's not going to be
too happy about that.

50
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:28,407
Spur and me
..we had a lot of dreams.


51
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,703
A lot of good times, too.

52
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,606
NOOO!

53
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,152
``United in death,'' the minister said.

54
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,654
Superstition.

55
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,239
It's a nice thought, Spur.

56
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,993
It's a great comfort to widows and fools.
There's more to life than death, Jim.

57
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,099
Well, that's it, lad.

58
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,393
You can't stay up here.

59
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,772
But...this is my place now.

60
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,320
I own it!

61
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,614
Owning it's got nothing to do with it.

62
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:34,575
It's who can make a go of it up here|
that counts.

63
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:39,746
I can look after myself!
Maybe some day.

64
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:43,917
What gives you the right to say...
LOOK!

65
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:49,464
You go down to the low country
and earn the right to live up here,

66
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,216
just like your father did.

67
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,431
Come.

68
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,985
They blame me for this.

69
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:14,198
It's a hard country.
It makes for hard men.

70
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,393
I'll get the fire going.

71
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:50,859
Spur's wallaby stew!

72
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:55,405
Mmm. Spoken of
in hushed and reverent tones.

73
00:10:57,074 --> 00:11:01,495
Dad was talking the other day of you
taking the harmonium up the mountain.

74
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:03,330
Uh, your mother's music box.

75
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:05,916
Your father and me
brought that up the mountain

76
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:06,876
with never a scratch on it.

77
00:11:06,918 --> 00:11:09,711
She gave me this seat. Mmm.

78
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:14,132
Whoo! Figured I could use it more.

79
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,260
Mmm. How's that mare Bess?

80
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:22,057
See ran off with a brumby...
the old thoroughbreds mob.

81
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,685
Mmm.
The big black.

82
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,645
Yeah.

83
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,273
I remember that animal.

84
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,816
I'll get her back.
Sure.

85
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,317
You'll walk in

86
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,445
and pluck her out of a thousand
square miles of wilderness.

87
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:36,947
I will, Spur.
Sure.

88
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:38,533
I'll run down that mob
and fetch her back.

89
00:11:38,575 --> 00:11:41,034
Sure, and on foot too!

90
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:55,090
I've no notion of his breeding,

91
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:58,093
but he's a mountain horse...
and a good one.

92
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,430
He's yours!

93
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:05,559
I can't pay you for him!
He's not for sale.

94
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:07,186
Now, hold on, Spur...
Don't argue.

95
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,397
A man without a horse,
is like a man without a leg.

96
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,244
Thank you, Spur.

97
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:26,288
Now I'll get the mare back.

98
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:30,125
Forget the mare, you duffer.
Don't throw effort after foolishness.

99
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,562
For you, sir,
I could get down to two guineas.

100
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:53,232
Good luck with the colt.
Very kind of you.

101
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,691
Good luck.
Thank you.

102
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:59,988
Tell you what...two pounds!
I've got other things on my mind today.

103
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,532
Damn Yankee.

104
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:05,244
Who is that?
Harrison. Picking up his colt.

105
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:09,289
They say it's worth £1,000.

106
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,625
A colt worth £1,000?

107
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,396
HARRISON: Mr Paterson!|Ah!

108
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,274
Listen, I'm sorry
about this blasted circus.

109
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,026
Oh, anything to get me away
from the city...

110
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:41,446
..especially when it's to bring you
the finest colt in the colony.

111
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:45,534
Well, he should be, for the price.

112
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:49,580
Old Regret. The last colt she foaled.

113
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,624
Mmm.|Irreplaceable.

114
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,065
Let go, mate.

115
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,609
Let bloody go!

116
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:24,323
Are you alright, Jessica?

117
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,953
If I needed your help, `MATE', 
I would've asked for it.

118
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,712
Come on, easy now. Whoa

119
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:57,648
Well, I think we're all indebted
to young Mr...

120
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,399
Craig. Jim Craig.

121
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:01,026
Andrew Paterson.

122
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,904
And that was Mr Harrison
and his charming daughter, Jessica.

123
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,572
Mmm. `Charming'.
All aboard!

124
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,074
Are you a stock agent?

125
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,993
No, as a matter of fact,
I'm a lawyer. You?

126
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,662
I've just arrived in town.

127
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,247
Well, thanks again, Jim.

128
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:16,208
If ever we can return the favour
let us know.

129
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,335
I'm looking for work, sir.

130
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:20,337
These are hard times, Jim.

131
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:23,549
I know that
but I've got a place to keep up.

132
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,094
I've lived on the land.
I can do anything.

133
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,097
And I've got a good stock horse.
Have you?

134
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:33,267
In that case,
we'd better try and find you work, then.

135
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:34,768
I'll give you a letter.

136
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,187
I know it's sitting
under your skirt somewhere.

137
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,693
You damned old trollop.

138
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:47,447
20 years you seduce a man
with a speck of gold dust.

139
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:51,493
Then you tempt him
with a trace of colour.

140
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:53,453
Nothing but a harlot.

141
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,127
Just like a woman -

142
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:03,130
has to have the last word.

143
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,318
How'd you find this place?

144
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,486
I tracked you.

145
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,155
You silly old galah.

146
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:31,241
You leave a trail
like a one-legged seed drill.

147
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:34,495
Damn you, Clancy.
Always sneaking around.

148
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,205
No noise.

149
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,998
I heard noise.

150
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,708
I heard voices.

151
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:44,004
Uh-huh! Sure sign of old age
when you start hearing things.

152
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:48,842
You and your partner
still searching for El Dorado, then?

153
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,137
Silent partner now.

154
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,307
Henry Craig's dead.

155
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,810
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

156
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,688
Yeah, just when
good colour was showing too.

157
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,483
You've been saying that
for near 20 years.

158
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:11,073
You know, the only way to shut that
mouth is with some food. Come on.

159
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:14,201
You've been offering me food
for 20 years too.

160
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:16,078
All I ever get's wallaby stew.

161
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,622
Bandicoot...

162
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,898
HARRISON: Mountain boy.
That's right, sir.

163
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,819
Curly!

164
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:50,362
Cut the heifer out.

165
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,867
I'll give you a try.

166
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:58,078
Usual wages and keep.
Make yourself known to the foreman.

167
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,914
Thank you, sir.

168
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:11,717
SPUR: Mmm. Tasty, huh?

169
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,971
In a toxic, festering sort of way.

170
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:19,099
You should advertise this stuff
in the `Bulletin'.

171
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,853
``The new miracle cure for appetite.''

172
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:26,273
To think I was going to leave you
a share of the mine.

173
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:29,651
Thanks, mate, but I have
my own rainbows to chase

174
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:32,988
Yeah, Clancy's vision splendid.

175
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,742
You still obsessed
with those sunlit plains, huh?

176
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,786
At least I get to see the sun
and the stars.

177
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:42,372
It's better than blundering around
in a black hole,

178
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:44,666
looking for something that isn't there.

179
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,835
Isn't there?! Now, you wait right here.

180
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:49,922
I'll show you.
``Blundering around'' in the dark, am I?

181
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,221
Well, wait till you see this.

182
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,139
Come here!

183
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:00,724
Take a look at this.

184
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:08,065
Now, that's the kind of colour
I've been getting lately.

185
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,820
It's not much to show for 20 years.

186
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,656
You must've dug a trench from
California to southern Australia.

187
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:19,284
Thats much better then anything
I saw there in 49.

188
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:22,788
Now, I put a drive straight through
for 30 chains.

189
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:27,000
I go down, sink a shaft and we're
smack on top of the richest vein.

190
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:28,502
Who's `we', Spur?

191
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:30,462
Henry Craig's boy.
You remember young Jim.

192
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:35,259
The lad doesn't know it yet,
but he inherits his father's share,

193
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,760
no matter what it is.

194
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,561
Craig! When you're finished here,
you can muck out the stables.

195
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,062
Yes, sir.

196
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:54,027
Here. He's a hard worker that lad.

197
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:59,616
Yeh, seems willing enough.
I can't understand why the boss took him on.

198
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:01,702
He comes from the mountains.

199
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,704
That was a long time ago.

200
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,456
Morning, Mrs Bailey.

201
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,845
Oh, g'day. I'm Jim Craig.

202
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:21,013
Pretty good at shoveling that, arn't yeh.

203
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,681
Pretty smart for a mountain fella.

204
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,435
Uses the flat end and everything.
Yeh

205
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:29,771
Live like bandicoots up in the hills.

206
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:33,025
You digging for grubs there bandicoot.

207
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:37,112
Have they given you the day off?

208
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:41,200
I'm studying to be supervisor.

209
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,371
Studying to be stupid!

210
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:51,877
You.

211
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,046
Morning, Miss Jessica.
Morning.

212
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,965
I'll get Kip out for you?
No, thank you.

213
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:59,593
Well I'll be about my duty miss.

214
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:02,179
Getting the hang of it, son?

215
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:06,183
Keep it up,
I'll be back latter to check on your work.

216
00:21:11,522 --> 00:21:17,319
Kip, what have you been up to...Eh?
Eh?

217
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:34,336
Uh, can I help?
No. No, I can manage.

218
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:03,073
Show me how you did that.

219
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:04,575
Easy.

220
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:08,620
So.

221
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,707
In through the loops.

222
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:16,712
There's a trick to that one!
There's no trick at all.

223
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:18,338
Let me have a go.

224
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,507
Now...like that?
This hand up.

225
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,302
Aha.
Turn it in.

226
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,012
That's right.

227
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:26,555
Pull through?
You've got it.

228
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:29,683
This one goes through there.
The ends go through the loops.

229
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:30,893
Pull
Pull!

230
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:34,021
Wrong.

231
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:35,856
What happened?
I don't know.

232
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,572
HARRISON: Craig.

233
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:51,079
Cool off the horse and stable him.
Yes, sir.

234
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,254
Jessica.

235
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:12,476
It's called the `tomfools' knot'.
You're getting the hang of it.

236
00:23:12,518 --> 00:23:14,561
I'll be back latter to check on your work.

237
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:21,318
Why aren't you at your lessons?

238
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,695
One of the brood mares is foaling,
she'll need a had.

239
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,906
You're not midwife
to a herd of horses.

240
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:28,700
The men can handle that.
I can do it better.

241
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:31,203
It's not an occupation for a lady.
``A lady''!

242
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:33,580
Yes, `lady'.
The word become old-fashioned?

243
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:36,166
It's become an excuse
to keep women under control!

244
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,669
Please spare me
your aunt's feminist rubbish.

245
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,129
You should be thinking
of marriage, children.

246
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,631
The well-known cattle breeder

247
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:45,175
has a breeding program
for his daughter as well.

248
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:46,677
You keep a civil tongue.

249
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:49,388
I don't understand
where this rudeness comes from.

250
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:55,018
Uh, which bed's mine?

251
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,521
Any one that doesn't buck you off, boy.

252
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:01,900
That one's empty, son.
It's yours if you want it.

253
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:06,363
You can keep your saddle
in the tack room.

254
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:08,866
Yeah, stop there yourself
if you like.

255
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:11,243
Grow up, Curly.
Drop dead, you old fart.

256
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:14,496
Watch your tongue, boy....
while you've still got one.

257
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:17,082
Deal the cards, boss.

258
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:24,131
They're starting the High Country
muster in a couple of days.

259
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:26,550
Gonna be an early winter,
according to Kane.

260
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:30,053
I thought Harrison
controlled the seasons.

261
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:33,724
I reckon the boss will hold
the muster till Clancy gets here.

262
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:37,311
Well, who's he, then? Some kind
of top rider, this Clancy bloke?

263
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:40,564
No, he's no rider. He's a horseman.

264
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:46,153
Yeh Curly, look at this.

265
00:24:46,195 --> 00:24:48,739
Well, what's so special
about Clancy, then?

266
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,158
I told you, he's a horseman.

267
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,245
`Horseman'?
Clancy's not just a horseman.

268
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:59,291
Clancy's a...a magician.
He's a genius.

269
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,336
I've met him.

270
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:07,132
When I was young.

271
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:09,426
He and my father were mates.

272
00:25:09,468 --> 00:25:11,637
Mates? Bullshit!

273
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:13,514
Mates! Mates.

274
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:16,266
Wouldn't have a bloody mate
to save his life.

275
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:23,148
Oh, sorry, Your Honour. Mates!
Sorry, beg your pardon, Your Honour.

276
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,068
Mates with Clancy, eh?

277
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:57,683
HARRISON: What's going on?
Some kind of union meeting?

278
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:00,269
They've heard that Clancy's coming.

279
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,272
Ah, they've all come out
to gawk at him, huh?

280
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:06,692
It's not often they get a chance
to meet a legend.

281
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:36,388
Jim Craig, isn't it?

282
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:39,975
Been a long time.
Yes, sir.

283
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:42,477
I'll see to your horses?

284
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:46,857
Watch him, he's a hog for water.

285
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:50,444
Oh, Jim.

286
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:53,405
I was very sorry
to hear about your father.

287
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:57,284
He was a good mate.

288
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:00,496
Clancy.
Kane.

289
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:10,464
``Go west, young man,'' they said.
``Go west!''

290
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:13,550
So I did - 10,000 miles further
than they intended.

291
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:16,845
And I found gold.
In beef cattle.

292
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:19,556
We made more money 
selling meat to the miners

293
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:22,768
than they ever dug up
in their claims, didn't we, Clancy?

294
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,020
Well, you sold them.
I only drove them.

295
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:28,190
He was known around the diggings
as `The California Horse-Trader'.

296
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:32,569
This is the finest trifle
I've ever eaten, Mrs Hume.

297
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:34,279
It's more than a trifle, Clancy.

298
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:35,948
It's a charlotte russe.
Charlotte russe!

299
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:39,326
My dear sister-in-law occasionally
bestows on us simple bush people

300
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:40,828
the fruits of her learning.

301
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:44,206
Just as well, or Jessica would've
been brought up with the kangaroos

302
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:46,458
and we'd be dining in a bark hut.

303
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,544
Rosemary, you never appreciate
the sacrifices made

304
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:50,462
in buiIding a property like this.

305
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:52,297
Would you pass the decanter, please?

306
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:55,342
Mr Paterson?

307
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:58,303
I'm sorry. I didn't realise.

308
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:01,723
That women may also enjoy what
custom deems is a man's privilege?

309
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:03,934
None of your speeches.
Aunt Rosemary's quite right.

310
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:07,104
Women SHOULD have the right
to do anything they're capable of.

311
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:09,273
You hear that?
The notion's like a germ.

312
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:11,733
My own daughter
infected with your nonsense.

313
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:14,236
Your own daughter,
as you know, has a good mind,

314
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:16,655
a way with horses
and an eye for stockbreeding.

315
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:20,159
Now would you have these developed,
or would you condemn her to domestic dullness

316
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,870
You should be in a ladys' college,
and not in the stabbles.

317
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:25,372
Well, whatever the complexities
of the argument, Mrs Hume,

318
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:27,833
you're certainly proof
the legal profession's been denied

319
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,585
the services of a great advocate.
Women lawyers? 

320
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:34,087
CLANCY:That'll be the day.. That such sweet 
liberation should have fathered su... 


321
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:38,009
I am sorry, madam.
MOTHERED such a disputation.

322
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:42,347
Rosemary,
if you're finished with the port...

323
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:43,849
Quite.

324
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:47,394
It's a far cry from
the dark rum we drank on the track.

325
00:28:47,436 --> 00:28:50,856
Ah, yes. Here's to those
long-gone days on the trail.

326
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:54,318
Well, for ME, they're not long gone.
So here's to their future.

327
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:56,069
Oh, there's no future there, Clancy.

328
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:59,573
I wouldn't swap the sunlit plains
for all the tea in China.

329
00:28:59,615 --> 00:29:01,992
They are a vision splendoured..

330
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:05,204
Clancy, how romantic.
Romantic?! Your brain's gone soft!

331
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:07,247
We've got
the railways and roads now.

332
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:09,500
Mr Paterson,
we can ship refrigerated beef

333
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,335
to the markets of England, Europe.

334
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:12,836
THAT'S where the future lies.

335
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:15,422
You were ALWAYS a way ahead
of the old squatters.

336
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:17,341
Which is why there's few of them left.

337
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,426
They tore the guts out of the country.
THEY did?!

338
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:23,680
I see the day when we'll be one of
the greatest food producers of the world.

339
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:27,017
And YOU have it all under control!
Yes, except for those mountains.

340
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:29,228
With the cattle,
I'd run freighters up there...

341
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:31,188
PRAISED be the lack of capitalism!

342
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,148
PATERSON: Ladies and gentIemen...

343
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:35,025
..may I propose a toast?|Er...

344
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:36,568
Yes.

345
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,654
To our two romantics.

346
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:42,491
To one who sees what is
and one who sees what can be.

347
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:44,618
Lord grant that the two are compatible.

348
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:55,754
Mrs Bailey said to bring
some more firewood.

349
00:29:55,796 --> 00:29:57,589
Hello, Jim.
Hello, Jim.

350
00:29:57,631 --> 00:29:59,091
Good evening, Jim.

351
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:02,678
Well, we all seem to be introduced.
Not all of us, Harrison.

352
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,596
I'm Mrs Hume.

353
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:06,348
How do you do, ma'am?

354
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:12,271
Jim, Mr Harrison was just talking
of taming the Snowy River country.

355
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:15,190
You know it better than us -
what do you think?

356
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:18,360
Well, sir...

357
00:30:19,444 --> 00:30:23,157
..I think you might sooner hold back
the tide than tame the mountains.

358
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:27,202
Excuse me, then.

359
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:32,708
That boy has a quality about him.

360
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:35,419
Yeah. The mongrel quality
of the mountain people.

361
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:37,129
Does that include your brother?

362
00:30:38,756 --> 00:30:41,300
I have no brother.

363
00:30:45,513 --> 00:30:51,227
We have a early start in the morning
Good Night!

364
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:54,062
``And Laban said unto him,

365
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:58,942
```I pray thee, if I have found
favour in thine eyes, tarry,

366
00:30:58,984 --> 00:31:01,069
```for I have learned by experience

367
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:04,615
```that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake.'

368
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:06,742
``And he said...

369
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:11,413
Here - last time I saw a saddle like that,
it was at the circus, you know?

370
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:12,665
Had a monkey riding on it!

371
00:31:12,707 --> 00:31:15,459
Where's your rope, Curly? Give up?


372
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:17,629


373
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,130
KANE: Lads.

374
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:22,799
I want everyone saddled and packed
by sunrise.

375
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:25,761
We'll eat at the Perry homestead

376
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:29,097
The only time
the boss eats his own beef.

377
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:31,392
And he don't know it.
Yeah!

378
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:35,270
Anything special we've got to take?

379
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:40,817
There's been a change of plans.

380
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:43,362
You won't be going on this muster, Jim.

381
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:44,863
W...?

382
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:46,366
They've probably seen
that half-pie mule of yours!

383
00:31:46,407 --> 00:31:50,452
He's a mountain horse.
He knows that country better than I do.

384
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:56,041
I don't make the orders.
But when I give them, that's the end of it.

385
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:03,757
Anyone not ready to go by dawn
gets their tail ends kicked!
 

386
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:08,512
You too short man.

387
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:10,013
Amen.

388
00:32:16,229 --> 00:32:18,730
Mr Kane?

389
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:22,943
Why? Why me?

390
00:32:29,492 --> 00:32:31,994
I think I know.

391
00:32:32,453 --> 00:32:35,122
You'll get your chance, Jim.

392
00:32:48,386 --> 00:32:51,221
Don't forget to feed the chooks bandicoot.

393
00:33:53,492 --> 00:33:55,536
Really, Jessica.

394
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:59,206
You're attacking that piece with all
the sensitivity of a road-mender.

395
00:33:59,248 --> 00:34:01,792
Now, let's begin again, shall we?

396
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:04,294
And this time, `con amore'.`

397
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:06,547
And spare me
the affectations of martyrdom.

398
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:08,507
Come.

399
00:34:10,259 --> 00:34:12,845
Ah, hello, Jim.
Ma'am.

400
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:16,890
Uh...Mrs Bailey said I should
bring this up. To save her legs.

401
00:34:16,932 --> 00:34:19,268
Your timing is Jessica's salvation.

402
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:20,936
Hello.

403
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:23,982
Will you join us for tea?

404
00:34:24,023 --> 00:34:27,527
No. I can't, Mrs Hume.
Oh, nonsense.

405
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:31,698
Male company will be a pleasant relief
in this hothouse of female emotions.

406
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:35,534
Er, Jessica, pour the tea.
I'll get another cup.

407
00:34:38,621 --> 00:34:42,457
Do you mind?
Well, no. Why should I?

408
00:34:45,336 --> 00:34:50,382
Well...we're both feeling
sorry for ourselves today.

409
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:54,428
Neither is where we want to be.

410
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,929
Yeah.

411
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:59,141
I think they're trying to make
a butler out of me.

412
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:02,102
Well, they're trying
to make a lady out of me.

413
00:35:02,144 --> 00:35:05,022
They won't have no luck.
Thank you very much!

414
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:06,732
Hang on. That's not what I...

415
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:09,276
They won't make a gentleman
out of you either.

416
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,951
Do you play?

417
00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:21,497
Yes. Just a bit.

418
00:35:22,664 --> 00:35:26,084
Before my mum died,
she was starting to teach me.

419
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:32,549
Do you miss her?

420
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:36,220
Yeah.

421
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:38,805
Yeah, I miss her.

422
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:42,017
I never knew my mother.

423
00:35:43,602 --> 00:35:45,103
I'm sorry.

424
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:47,606
I bet she was pretty.

425
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,192
Like you.

426
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:53,111
Mmm, thank you, kind sir.

427
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:02,371
Thanks for the tea...

428
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:04,039
..Jessica.

429
00:36:05,165 --> 00:36:07,876
I've got a few jobs to finish
before dinnertime.

430
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:46,456
There's a man.

431
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,172
He's a pretty thing.

432
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:56,091
There's not a mean bone in his body.

433
00:36:56,133 --> 00:37:00,596
Curly will find one.
He does all the breaking around here.

434
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:02,097
Curly?!

435
00:37:03,182 --> 00:37:05,809
You've got to be firm
with a young horse.

436
00:37:05,851 --> 00:37:09,146
But not cruel. You work
with a horse, not against him.

437
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:12,858
Really?
That's what my father taught me.

438
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,111
This is not just a mountain brumby.

439
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:20,782
It's no different.

440
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:23,076
Are you saying you could break this horse?

441
00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:25,704
Yes.

442
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:29,500
Well...

443
00:37:32,044 --> 00:37:33,670
What about your father?

444
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:36,298
He'll be away for more than a week.

445
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:40,344
If the job's done before he gets back,
what can he say?

446
00:41:56,975 --> 00:41:58,477
Bess!

447
00:42:03,607 --> 00:42:05,192
Jim? Don't you dare!

448
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:12,426
How's the head?

449
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:19,766
Mrs Bailey toId me this is your favourite.

450
00:43:20,893 --> 00:43:22,644
What happened to the colt?

451
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:24,354
We yarded him.
Is he alright?

452
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:27,691
Oh, he's still a bit flighty,
but not hurt - luckily.

453
00:43:27,733 --> 00:43:30,903
There'll be hell to pay
when your father finds out.

454
00:43:30,944 --> 00:43:34,448
Well, he won't find out.
We've all agreed not to tell him.

455
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:36,116
'We'? Who's `we'?

456
00:43:36,158 --> 00:43:38,202
Mrs Bailey, Aunt Rosemary and I.

457
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:41,455
I'm not hiding behind the skirts
of a bunch of women!

458
00:43:41,497 --> 00:43:43,081
Oh, I'm so sorry!

459
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:46,335
I must remember that
next time you try to kill yourself.

460
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:47,836
That's nonsense, Jessica.

461
00:43:47,878 --> 00:43:50,881
Well, somebody's got to save you
from your own thoughtlessness!

462
00:43:50,923 --> 00:43:53,842
Don't you Harrisons get tired of
running other peoples lives.

463
00:43:53,884 --> 00:43:55,969
You ungrateful...!!
Because I'm getting tired of it.

464
00:43:56,011 --> 00:43:59,556
Well don't worry,
thats the last time I'll stand up
for the likes of you

465
00:43:59,598 --> 00:44:01,058
Jessica!

466
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:03,977
You are a foolish boy, Jim.

467
00:44:38,428 --> 00:44:39,930
How many missing?

468
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:41,890
KANE: 20, at the last count.

469
00:44:41,932 --> 00:44:44,101
Take your horse for you,
Mr Harrison?

470
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:45,644
Hey, where's the mountain boy?

471
00:44:45,686 --> 00:44:47,396
Uh, still in his bunk.

472
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:54,945
Craig?

473
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,533
You waiting for breakfast in bed?

474
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:01,243
What happened?

475
00:45:01,285 --> 00:45:02,911
I came off the...

476
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:04,454
..off a horse.

477
00:45:04,496 --> 00:45:09,751
You think you could get back on?
Pick up 20 strays we left up on top?

478
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:11,253
Yes, sir.

479
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:15,090
Before those mountain men
get their grubby hands on them.

480
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:47,873
JIM: It's good to be back.

481
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:49,917
At least nothing changes up here.

482
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:53,337
I saw Bess again with the brumbies.
Nearly got her back.

483
00:45:53,378 --> 00:45:56,715
I told you not to throw effort
after foolishness. Forget it.

484
00:45:58,217 --> 00:46:00,511
How are things going on down there?

485
00:46:00,552 --> 00:46:02,054
Not good.

486
00:46:03,388 --> 00:46:05,724
I'm working for a fellow called Harrison.

487
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:09,728
He reminds me of someone.

488
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:11,939
You never told me you had a brother.

489
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,274
You never asked.
Well, I'm asking now.

490
00:46:14,316 --> 00:46:16,568
You just concern yourself with Jim Craig.

491
00:46:23,158 --> 00:46:25,160
Have you seen Jessica?

492
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,120
Yeah.

493
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:28,997
What's she like?

494
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:30,833
She's a Harrison.

495
00:46:32,376 --> 00:46:36,004
I'm getting out after this muster.

496
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:38,340
Henry Craigs' son quitting?

497
00:46:38,382 --> 00:46:41,093
Are you saying I shouId stick it out?

498
00:46:41,134 --> 00:46:44,096
You can learn more from Harrison
than you know.

499
00:46:45,764 --> 00:46:48,100
I'll be searching for his strays for weeks.

500
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:49,393
Not if you know where to look.

501
00:46:49,434 --> 00:46:50,602
At the first hint of snow,

502
00:46:50,644 --> 00:46:54,565
every beast on this plato heds for the bluff.

503
00:46:54,606 --> 00:46:59,570
Warm pocket, good forage.
Gather them up with a butterfly net.

504
00:46:59,611 --> 00:47:01,196
How do you know?

505
00:47:01,238 --> 00:47:04,533
Well, I don't always eat wallaby, son!

506
00:47:09,163 --> 00:47:10,497
Grubby hands.

507
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:13,709
Harrison was right.

508
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,883
I'd say prime 2-year-old Hereford.
Mmm!

509
00:47:20,924 --> 00:47:22,885
Fattened on mountain pasture.|Mmm!

510
00:47:23,969 --> 00:47:26,054
Might be a good cattleman yet!

511
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:58,420
You walk this horse to stable.

512
00:48:47,511 --> 00:48:49,221
What happened to the colt?

513
00:48:49,263 --> 00:48:51,515
The wild horses came down,
ran through the place. They set him off.

514
00:48:51,515 --> 00:48:53,725
I'm asking Jessica.

515
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:58,021
A bruise in the foreleg.

516
00:48:58,063 --> 00:49:01,233
Black soil from the bottom paddock
still on the hoofs.

517
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:04,862
And a girth mark
around the horse's belly. Huh?

518
00:49:04,903 --> 00:49:07,781
You're an intelligent girl, Jessica.

519
00:49:07,823 --> 00:49:10,576
What does that add up to, huh?

520
00:49:10,617 --> 00:49:13,287
Your old friend is still alive.

521
00:49:13,328 --> 00:49:14,788
The stallion.

522
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:20,127
He was leading the brumbies.

523
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:28,051
Who rode the colt?

524
00:49:28,093 --> 00:49:29,887
We were breaking him in...
'We'?

525
00:49:29,928 --> 00:49:32,181
Jim's very good with horses.
That mountain boy.

526
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:33,849
Now, wait. It wasn't his fault.

527
00:49:33,891 --> 00:49:36,602
He was riding it
when the brumbies came down.

528
00:49:36,643 --> 00:49:39,271
He went to save the stock horses.
What stupidity!

529
00:49:39,313 --> 00:49:41,607
To save stock horses
worth a few shillings

530
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:43,275
and risk a colt worth £1,000?!

531
00:49:43,317 --> 00:49:46,278
You can't blame him for that.
It happened too suddenly.

532
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,779
Well, `suddenly', he's finished here!

533
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:50,699
He gets off this place
the moment he gets back.

534
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:53,368
There's a train tomorrow.
Take Jessica with you.

535
00:49:53,368 --> 00:49:55,954
You will board
at the Presbyterian Ladies' College.

536
00:49:55,996 --> 00:49:57,456
No! I won't go!

537
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:01,460
You're as deceitful as your mother.

538
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:18,310
You wouldn't dare break the spirit
of that wretched colt

539
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:20,813
the way you just crushed
your own daughter.

540
00:50:20,854 --> 00:50:22,648
My daughter?

541
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:24,399
You really believe that?

542
00:50:24,483 --> 00:50:26,819
Oh, when will you give up this obsession?

543
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,529
You tell me. Matilda's your sister.

544
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:31,406
You see other people so clearly,
but look at yourself

545
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:35,410
What if the night you fired those shots,
your aim had been better?

546
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:37,079
What then?

547
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:04,106
Now all we need's a butterfly net.

548
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:24,501
Get uphill.

549
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:50,546
NO!

550
00:53:08,063 --> 00:53:09,898
I don't understand.

551
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:12,234
She's never done
anything like this before.

552
00:53:12,276 --> 00:53:15,112
They've been drinking
since they got back with the cattle.

553
00:53:15,154 --> 00:53:18,115
Weather turning bad.
We've got to find her quick.

554
00:53:18,157 --> 00:53:20,659
They're not going to be any use to us.

555
00:53:20,701 --> 00:53:22,161
What?

556
00:53:22,202 --> 00:53:25,414
The men are drunk.
They won't be any use to us.

557
00:53:25,455 --> 00:53:28,208
I want them ready to ride in 10 minutes.

558
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:29,710
Yes, sir.

559
00:53:36,091 --> 00:53:38,302
Alright, up! I want all men.

560
00:53:38,343 --> 00:53:41,138
Moss, you've got five minutes
to be dressed and outside!

561
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,307
Curly? Curly!

562
00:53:43,348 --> 00:53:45,392
God save us.

563
00:53:46,476 --> 00:53:49,021
Come on, old man. I need you.

564
00:53:49,062 --> 00:53:50,522
It was him or me.

565
00:53:50,564 --> 00:53:53,317
You better be careful
what you say in your sleep.

566
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:57,029
Jessica's gone and got herself lost.
I need a tracker and you're it.

567
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:00,157
Can't even see to find my boots.
Well, go without them!

568
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:01,783
Five minutes!

569
00:54:57,673 --> 00:55:01,927
Boss, the men are exhausted...
and there's a storm coming up.

570
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:03,887
And my daughter's out there in it.

571
00:55:05,514 --> 00:55:09,268
In a few minutes we're not going
to be able to see anything.

572
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:11,728
Then stay here and rot.

573
00:55:33,542 --> 00:55:35,085
Kip?

574
00:56:35,813 --> 00:56:39,650
Boss, there's no hope of finding
any tracks after all that rain.

575
00:56:39,691 --> 00:56:41,276
We've got to keep looking.

576
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:09,012
HELP ME!

577
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:15,561
Oh, help.

578
00:57:15,602 --> 00:57:18,230
Jess!

579
00:57:38,876 --> 00:57:43,297
So, that's it, eh?
No more working for the old...

580
00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:44,798
..your father.

581
00:57:45,883 --> 00:57:48,468
I never thought
I'd be sorry about that...

582
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,221
..but I am.

583
00:57:52,306 --> 00:57:53,807
Why are you sorry?

584
00:57:55,475 --> 00:57:56,977
I'll miss seeing you.

585
00:57:58,437 --> 00:58:01,607
You won't miss seeing me,
'cause I'm not going back.

586
00:58:01,648 --> 00:58:03,984
Come on Jess, you can't...
Listen!

587
00:58:04,026 --> 00:58:07,404
When I was trapped on that cliff,
I was terrified,

588
00:58:07,446 --> 00:58:11,658
but that passed and...
I started to see things very clearly.

589
00:58:12,743 --> 00:58:16,747
All I wanted was to see you again.
To be with you.

590
00:58:16,788 --> 00:58:19,833
Nothing else.

591
00:58:21,418 --> 00:58:23,712
And so I hung on until you came.

592
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:28,050
Jess, I...

593
00:58:42,981 --> 00:58:44,900
I have to take you back.

594
00:58:44,942 --> 00:58:46,777
But I'm not going back.

595
00:58:46,819 --> 00:58:48,779
They'll be worried sick about you.

596
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:51,949
I don't care.

597
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:55,160
There'll be men out looking for you,
risking their lives.

598
00:58:56,245 --> 00:58:58,664
Anyhow, I've got to get the cattle down.

599
00:58:59,748 --> 00:59:01,792
Haven't you been listening to me?

600
00:59:01,834 --> 00:59:03,377
Yeah, it's just that...

601
00:59:05,003 --> 00:59:06,922
..I have to finish this job.

602
00:59:10,968 --> 00:59:14,346
I'll take you to Spur's place
and come back for the cattle.

603
00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:21,895
I'm sorry.

604
00:59:23,147 --> 00:59:26,150
It's just that,
everything seemed so clear to me.

605
00:59:48,005 --> 00:59:49,506
I'm sorry.

606
01:00:05,856 --> 01:00:08,734
It's so peaceful here.

607
01:00:11,361 --> 01:00:14,156
It's like we're the only two people on earth.

608
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,205
You ready, then?

609
01:01:29,106 --> 01:01:30,649
Oh, Jim.

610
01:01:30,691 --> 01:01:32,151
It's...

611
01:01:32,192 --> 01:01:33,694
It's beautiful.

612
01:01:35,404 --> 01:01:37,322
But wait till that gets here.

613
01:01:38,448 --> 01:01:41,118
It changes so suddenly, doesn't it?

614
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,745
One minute, it's like paradise and...

615
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:47,166
..the next, it's trying to kill you.

616
01:01:47,207 --> 01:01:49,501
Yep. That's how it can be up here.

617
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:51,003
But, uh...

618
01:01:52,629 --> 01:01:57,134
..if it was easy to get to know it,
there'd be...no challenge.

619
01:01:59,303 --> 01:02:01,305
You've got to treat the mountains...

620
01:02:02,556 --> 01:02:04,558
..like a high-spirited horse.

621
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,518
Never take them for granted.

622
01:02:08,353 --> 01:02:10,397
It's the same with people too.

623
01:03:01,698 --> 01:03:03,200
SPUR: Gone.

624
01:03:04,743 --> 01:03:06,370
Nothing.

625
01:03:06,411 --> 01:03:07,913
No colour.

626
01:03:07,955 --> 01:03:10,749
Jezebel!

627
01:03:35,065 --> 01:03:38,277
Holy creature!

628
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:42,322
So, that's what you've been trying
to tell me all these years, huh?

629
01:03:42,364 --> 01:03:44,533
That you're up HERE.

630
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:04,011
Spur?

631
01:04:09,183 --> 01:04:10,684
Damn.

632
01:04:10,726 --> 01:04:12,561
What a strange place!

633
01:04:12,603 --> 01:04:14,396
Who is this Spur?

634
01:04:15,772 --> 01:04:17,941
I thought you knew him.

635
01:04:17,983 --> 01:04:19,776
Why should I?

636
01:04:20,819 --> 01:04:23,655
You wait here.
I'll check down at the creek.

637
01:04:34,249 --> 01:04:35,751
Spur?

638
01:05:02,736 --> 01:05:04,238
He's not down there.

639
01:05:26,927 --> 01:05:28,804
SPUR: Jim!

640
01:05:28,846 --> 01:05:30,347
Jim Craig!

641
01:05:30,389 --> 01:05:31,807
Jim, my boy!

642
01:05:31,849 --> 01:05:34,601
They said old Spur was mad...Ha!
Are you alright?

643
01:05:36,145 --> 01:05:39,022
I never felt better in my life!


644
01:05:39,064 --> 01:05:40,524
I...

645
01:05:51,076 --> 01:05:53,078
Matilda.

646
01:05:54,163 --> 01:05:55,789
I found the gold.

647
01:05:55,831 --> 01:05:58,208
I'm Jessica.

648
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:00,252
Jessica Harrison.

649
01:06:03,797 --> 01:06:06,300
Oh, Jessica!

650
01:06:08,594 --> 01:06:10,679
You've grown up.

651
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:12,723
Jess, this is Spur.

652
01:06:12,764 --> 01:06:14,892
And, uh...

653
01:06:14,933 --> 01:06:18,520
..he's your uncle, your father's brother.

654
01:06:19,605 --> 01:06:23,567
One of life's injustices. You never
get to choose your own relatives.

655
01:06:26,695 --> 01:06:28,197
Uncle?

656
01:06:28,238 --> 01:06:30,574
Let this be a lesson to you, Jim.

657
01:06:30,616 --> 01:06:32,075
I find a little gold

658
01:06:32,117 --> 01:06:35,662
and suddenly, after all these years,
the relatives turn up.

659
01:06:35,704 --> 01:06:38,624
Why do you keep this portrait of my mother?

660
01:06:40,167 --> 01:06:44,630
The prettiest visitor I've ever had
and not even a cup of tea! Come on.

661
01:06:45,756 --> 01:06:49,885
What are you trying to hide from me?
I'm not a child.

662
01:06:52,012 --> 01:06:53,847
Hey, Jessica...

663
01:07:00,688 --> 01:07:04,274
It's a lot of pain and suffering
when you try to dig up the past.

664
01:07:04,316 --> 01:07:10,405
Look Spur, Jess has to get home,
and I have to go back for the cattle.

665
01:07:10,447 --> 01:07:12,407
Can you take her down?

666
01:07:12,449 --> 01:07:14,660
Sure. Sure.

667
01:07:15,744 --> 01:07:17,871
You look after her for me, then.

668
01:07:17,913 --> 01:07:19,498
Oh, I'll look after her...

669
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:21,416
..like you were my own daughter.

670
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:23,502
I won't be far behind you.

671
01:07:25,504 --> 01:07:27,673
And don't touch his wallaby stew.

672
01:07:27,714 --> 01:07:29,842
Why, you ungrateful tyke!

673
01:07:29,883 --> 01:07:31,802
There'll be no wallaby tonight!

674
01:07:31,844 --> 01:07:34,096
I'll kill the fatted calf.

675
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:38,142
Come to think of it
I already have.

676
01:08:19,391 --> 01:08:22,269
It WAS silly, I suppose,
but I was so angry!

677
01:08:22,311 --> 01:08:25,230
Then I couldn't think
of anything else but seeing Jim.

678
01:08:25,272 --> 01:08:26,732
No harm done.

679
01:08:26,773 --> 01:08:30,861
What's the sense of being young
if you can't be impulsive now and then?

680
01:08:30,903 --> 01:08:32,738
Now, tablecloth.
No expense spared.

681
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:35,491
And you can read the news while you're eating.

682
01:08:37,034 --> 01:08:41,371
They charge you three guineas extra
for the cobwebs down in the city.

683
01:08:41,413 --> 01:08:43,540
Glasses?
On the shelf.

684
01:08:43,582 --> 01:08:47,628
Oh. These must be quite valuable.
Matched pair.

685
01:08:47,669 --> 01:08:49,213
They're both broken.

686
01:08:49,254 --> 01:08:53,592
Jessica, take this plate,
and follow me to the cool room.

687
01:08:53,634 --> 01:08:57,513
Now, for the pièce de rèsistance.

688
01:08:57,554 --> 01:08:59,139
Ah, you raise beef!

689
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:00,724
Oh, well known for it.

690
01:09:00,766 --> 01:09:02,226
Small, modest herd

691
01:09:02,267 --> 01:09:06,271
made up of poor creatures.
who've lost their way

692
01:09:06,313 --> 01:09:09,441
And, uh, `H' is for...?

693
01:09:09,483 --> 01:09:10,984
Uh, `homeless'.

694
01:09:45,394 --> 01:09:46,937
Thank god she's safe.
Where is she?

695
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:49,773
She's on her way home.

696
01:10:13,672 --> 01:10:17,718
Why haven't I been told about Spur?

697
01:10:19,761 --> 01:10:21,930
Well, was my mother unfaithful? Or...

698
01:10:22,014 --> 01:10:23,599
Nonsense, girl.
Was she?

699
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:27,060
What did Spur tell you?
Nothing.

700
01:10:29,062 --> 01:10:30,898
Aunt Rosemary, please.

701
01:10:42,075 --> 01:10:43,577
About 20 years ago,

702
01:10:43,619 --> 01:10:47,331
two brothers fell in love with
the prettiest girl in the district.

703
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:51,043
Oh, she was young and life
for Matilda was like childish games.

704
01:10:51,084 --> 01:10:53,837
Well, both the men
wanted her hand in marriage,

705
01:10:53,879 --> 01:10:55,672
but she couldn't choose between them.

706
01:10:55,714 --> 01:11:00,052
So she decided the first one to make
his fortune would be her husband.

707
01:11:00,093 --> 01:11:01,887
She hadn't the faintest idea

708
01:11:01,929 --> 01:11:04,890
what chain of events
that would set in motion.

709
01:11:04,932 --> 01:11:08,352
Well, one of the men scraped
all his savings together

710
01:11:08,393 --> 01:11:13,065
and gambled in one bold throw -
a horse named Pardon in the Cup.

711
01:11:13,106 --> 01:11:15,692
It won, at 50-to-1 . He was wealthy.

712
01:11:15,734 --> 01:11:17,653
Father.

713
01:11:17,694 --> 01:11:19,571
And Spur?

714
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:23,659
He went looking for gold.

715
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:34,086
My dear Mrs Bailey, tell me,

716
01:11:34,127 --> 01:11:38,799
by what magic do you transform
this humble farmyard chicken

717
01:11:38,841 --> 01:11:41,176
into such delicate ambrosia?

718
01:11:41,218 --> 01:11:43,428
You do go on.

719
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:46,014
And you gave me my favourite piece too.

720
01:11:46,056 --> 01:11:48,559
Oh?
A plump breast.

721
01:11:51,812 --> 01:11:54,857
Unless it be...tenderloin.

722
01:11:54,898 --> 01:11:58,610
Oooh! Mrs Bailey!

723
01:11:58,652 --> 01:12:01,238
Ooh, you're a cruel woman!
Oh, I'm sorry.

724
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,158
Are you alright?
I knew the moment I walked in.

725
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:10,289
I said to myself, ``This...is a woman
to satisfy a man's...appetites.''

726
01:12:11,832 --> 01:12:13,959
I didn't expect you for a while.

727
01:12:14,001 --> 01:12:16,378
So I see.

728
01:12:17,796 --> 01:12:20,007
How's Jessica?
She's fine.

729
01:12:20,048 --> 01:12:23,427
Er...Spur was, er, just helping me
get her supper ready.

730
01:12:23,468 --> 01:12:25,262
Oh, YOU'RE still here!

731
01:12:25,304 --> 01:12:28,098
Well, you'd better not be
when your brother gets back.

732
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:31,059
Run away? I'm too old
to play the prodigal son.

733
01:12:31,101 --> 01:12:33,395
Er, thank you, Mrs Bailey.

734
01:12:33,437 --> 01:12:35,898
And come on, Jim.
After I see Jess.

735
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:38,317
Hey, I think we'd better be going.

736
01:12:39,401 --> 01:12:42,946
We'll let the weather clear a bit.
I want to see her.

737
01:12:55,417 --> 01:12:56,919
Hey!

738
01:13:09,932 --> 01:13:12,226
Yes?

739
01:13:28,951 --> 01:13:30,577
Forgive me?

740
01:13:35,499 --> 01:13:37,000
You're back.

741
01:13:47,761 --> 01:13:50,639
My thanks to you
for my daughter's safe return.

742
01:13:53,142 --> 01:13:55,102
Kane speaks highly of you.

743
01:13:55,144 --> 01:13:57,229
Says you'd make a good cattleman.

744
01:13:57,271 --> 01:13:58,814
I've got a few ideas.

745
01:13:58,856 --> 01:14:01,733
Well, maybe I can be
of some help to you.

746
01:14:01,775 --> 01:14:03,485
It's time we had a talk.

747
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:06,113
You just rest, Jess.

748
01:14:06,155 --> 01:14:07,614
Come.

749
01:14:19,084 --> 01:14:20,878
When did you find Jessica?

750
01:14:22,504 --> 01:14:24,006
Yesterday morning.

751
01:14:25,424 --> 01:14:26,967
Morning.

752
01:14:27,009 --> 01:14:28,468
Sit down.

753
01:14:31,096 --> 01:14:33,307
You're very fond of my daughter, huh?

754
01:14:35,893 --> 01:14:37,769
I love her.

755
01:14:37,811 --> 01:14:39,605
Mmm. Love?

756
01:14:39,646 --> 01:14:41,982
It's a goddamn strange sort of love.

757
01:14:42,024 --> 01:14:43,692
Well, would you call it love?

758
01:14:43,734 --> 01:14:48,572
Take a girl who'd been brought up
to this and put her in a bark hut? Hmm?

759
01:14:48,614 --> 01:14:50,073
We'd make do.

760
01:14:50,115 --> 01:14:54,328
Living on air? Watch her grow old
with hard work and child-bearing?

761
01:14:54,369 --> 01:14:56,121
I'd look after her.
Mm-hm.

762
01:14:56,163 --> 01:14:58,707
Anyway, why don't you ask her?
The decision is yours.

763
01:14:58,749 --> 01:15:02,544
If you had a spark of man in you,
you'd know the right thing to do is to walk away.

764
01:15:02,586 --> 01:15:05,924
Now hang on! Your not the only one
that can make something out of life.

765
01:15:05,965 --> 01:15:08,842
I've got plans for my own place.

766
01:15:08,884 --> 01:15:10,636
Make them with someone else's daughter.

767
01:15:10,677 --> 01:15:12,429
I didn't carve this place out

768
01:15:12,471 --> 01:15:15,390
to see Jessica run off
with some fortune-hunter who come along!

769
01:15:15,432 --> 01:15:17,434
You BASTARD!
SPUR: Jim!

770
01:15:27,694 --> 01:15:29,905
How dare you come in this house?

771
01:15:29,947 --> 01:15:33,325
My long-lost brother.
Didn't recognise you without a gun.

772
01:15:33,367 --> 01:15:34,827
Get out.

773
01:15:34,868 --> 01:15:37,371
Gun? What is going on?

774
01:15:37,412 --> 01:15:40,791
Come on, Jessica. Back to bed.
Oh, no. I'm sick of secrets.

775
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:43,794
Get to bed!
And both of you, get out or I'll...!

776
01:15:43,836 --> 01:15:46,797
You'll what?
Blow off the other one?

777
01:15:46,839 --> 01:15:49,466
Spur...please.

778
01:15:50,509 --> 01:15:52,594
I only shot to warn you off.

779
01:15:54,221 --> 01:15:57,558
I'd hate to be around
if your intentions were serious.

780
01:15:57,599 --> 01:15:58,851
Father!

781
01:15:58,892 --> 01:16:03,105
Tell me what happened!

782
01:16:03,147 --> 01:16:04,940
Jessica, go to bed.
No!

783
01:16:04,982 --> 01:16:06,650
I have a right to know!

784
01:16:06,692 --> 01:16:08,986
Oh, for heaven's sake, Harrison!

785
01:16:09,027 --> 01:16:12,823
Let's get this thing out of the way
once and for all.

786
01:16:14,825 --> 01:16:17,786
Spur gave your mother
a wedding present - a young colt.

787
01:16:17,828 --> 01:16:19,913
Old Regret's first foal.

788
01:16:19,955 --> 01:16:23,625
But your father couldn't stand the thought
of another man giving her anything.

789
01:16:23,667 --> 01:16:25,544
I wanted to shoot
the animal, but...I couldn't.

790
01:16:25,586 --> 01:16:29,673
I'm glad you draw the line someware.

791
01:16:29,715 --> 01:16:32,593
Your mother feared for the horse
and turned it loose.

792
01:16:32,634 --> 01:16:35,429
Spur saw it running free
and came to tell her.

793
01:16:35,471 --> 01:16:37,389
And your father found them together.

794
01:16:37,431 --> 01:16:39,266
Oh, it was all quite innocent, but...

795
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:43,145
..your father was in a rage
and...Spur was shot.

796
01:16:43,187 --> 01:16:48,817
Matilda decided to leave
Enough.

797
01:16:57,159 --> 01:17:00,537
In a way, she did go of her own accord...

798
01:17:00,579 --> 01:17:02,498
..when you were born.

799
01:17:10,756 --> 01:17:14,218
You're more a part of this, Jim,
than you realise.

800
01:17:14,259 --> 01:17:18,263
Matilda's colt is now the old stallion.

801
01:17:18,305 --> 01:17:20,224
He leads the brumbies.

802
01:17:22,434 --> 01:17:26,772
Now, who's to judge a man the rest
of his life for one impetuous act?

803
01:17:26,814 --> 01:17:28,565
It happened a long time ago.

804
01:17:28,607 --> 01:17:31,568
I want to forget it...
bare no malice.

805
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:33,070
Hey, don't worry.

806
01:17:33,111 --> 01:17:36,198
It's just the beginning.
Not the end.

807
01:17:43,956 --> 01:17:45,457
Spur?
Mmm?

808
01:17:46,667 --> 01:17:49,920
I haven't had so much
feminine attention in years.

809
01:17:49,962 --> 01:17:51,505
I like it.

810
01:17:54,967 --> 01:17:59,468
I'm leaving too.
Then I am comming with you

811
01:18:06,979 --> 01:18:08,522
It couldn't work, Jess.


812
01:18:26,748 --> 01:18:27,791
SPUR: Ah! That's nice.

813
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:31,003
You come to open the gate,
for your crippled brother.

814
01:18:31,044 --> 01:18:33,922
You said enough tonight.

815
01:18:33,964 --> 01:18:36,758
Turning Jessica against me.

816
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,760
Just as you did Matilda years ago.

817
01:18:38,802 --> 01:18:41,513
You misjudge the girl.

818
01:18:41,555 --> 01:18:43,474
Just as you did her mother!

819
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:52,483
Whose child is she?

820
01:18:52,483 --> 01:18:55,486
Poor Mr Harrison.

821
01:18:55,527 --> 01:18:58,405
You owe me the truth!

822
01:18:58,447 --> 01:19:00,866
If you really knew Matilda...

823
01:19:00,908 --> 01:19:03,285
..you could never ask that.

824
01:19:03,327 --> 01:19:05,871
Of COURSE she's yours!

825
01:19:05,913 --> 01:19:08,373
But you dont deserve her!

826
01:19:26,683 --> 01:19:29,102
Oh, bandicoot! Oh!

827
01:19:29,144 --> 01:19:31,855
Hear you've been up the big house,
boy, eh?

828
01:19:31,897 --> 01:19:34,107
Did you break in more than the colt

829
01:19:34,149 --> 01:19:36,568
while you were up on that muster,
hey

830
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:38,987
Did you have to use your spurs, boy?

831
01:19:40,531 --> 01:19:43,116
You've got the mind
of a gutter rat, Curly!

832
01:19:49,081 --> 01:19:50,958
Loose the bottle!

833
01:19:53,043 --> 01:19:56,463
I did it before...
and so help me, I'll do it again.

834
01:20:50,267 --> 01:20:53,520
You know, I could be hard to find
in the mountains.

835
01:20:55,522 --> 01:20:58,442
You're welcome at my fire any time..

836
01:21:28,764 --> 01:21:32,059
That horse is worth £1,000, Moss.

837
01:21:34,353 --> 01:21:36,647
You know how much money? Huh?
Oh, yeah.

838
01:21:36,688 --> 01:21:41,068
That's more than you'd earn in a lifetime
working for that PRIG Harrison!

839
01:21:41,109 --> 01:21:43,403
Yeah.
Well, I'm going to fix him.

840
01:21:51,578 --> 01:21:53,080
Yeah!

841
01:21:53,121 --> 01:21:54,957
That fixed him! Yeah!
Who?

842
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:59,169
Bandicoot, you idiot.
They'll think he did that.

843
01:22:14,268 --> 01:22:17,563
Well, it's definite. We found clean tracks.

844
01:22:17,604 --> 01:22:19,898
The colt's joined the brumby mob.

845
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:21,900
Jesus Christ.

846
01:22:21,942 --> 01:22:25,654
Well, at least he's not been stolen.
Somebody set him loose!

847
01:22:25,696 --> 01:22:28,615
No prizes guessing who.

848
01:22:28,657 --> 01:22:32,202
Every man from every station about
will be here by morning.

849
01:22:33,287 --> 01:22:34,872
You find Clancy?

850
01:22:34,913 --> 01:22:36,707
Not as yet.
Well, get him!

851
01:22:36,748 --> 01:22:38,458
That man's part bloodhound.

852
01:22:39,626 --> 01:22:41,587
We'll get the colt back, boss.

853
01:23:00,772 --> 01:23:02,274
JIM: No, thanks.

854
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:05,777
SPUR: You don't drink
with your partner?

855
01:23:06,945 --> 01:23:09,323
Partner?
The goldmine.

856
01:23:09,364 --> 01:23:12,284
Your father always had a half-share in it.

857
01:23:12,326 --> 01:23:14,495
It's yours now.

858
01:23:14,536 --> 01:23:17,080
You reckon there's enough in it for two?

859
01:23:18,165 --> 01:23:19,666
You'd better have a drink.

860
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:23,170
May be the only thing
you ever get out of the partnership.

861
01:23:23,212 --> 01:23:25,714
In that case...

862
01:23:36,683 --> 01:23:38,477
Jesus, Clancy!

863
01:23:38,519 --> 01:23:40,813
You're going to give me a heart seizure!

864
01:23:40,854 --> 01:23:44,316
You never could hear anyone else
when you were doing the talking.

865
01:23:45,859 --> 01:23:47,361
G'day, Jim.

866
01:23:47,402 --> 01:23:49,613
Thought I'd find you here.

867
01:23:49,655 --> 01:23:51,782
Staring at the mountains.

868
01:23:51,824 --> 01:23:53,283
Yep.

869
01:23:53,325 --> 01:23:55,786
Only place I'll ever feel at home.

870
01:23:55,828 --> 01:23:58,247
Aren't you heading in the wrong direction?

871
01:23:58,288 --> 01:23:59,748
No.

872
01:24:00,874 --> 01:24:04,294
Heading back for Harrison's.
You're a demon for punishment.

873
01:24:05,462 --> 01:24:07,506
Somebody let Harrison's colt go.

874
01:24:07,548 --> 01:24:09,550
What?!
The colt from Old Regret?

875
01:24:10,759 --> 01:24:12,678
He's joined the brumbies.

876
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:15,889
There's a mob of us
going after him in the morning.

877
01:24:15,931 --> 01:24:18,392
I thought you might want to be in it.

878
01:24:24,857 --> 01:24:28,193
Well, they said
you were, uh...good with a horse.

879
01:24:28,235 --> 01:24:31,530
What's the first thing you do
when a horse bucks you off?

880
01:24:31,572 --> 01:24:34,825
You don't let him beat you,
you get straight back on.

881
01:24:34,867 --> 01:24:36,326
Well?

882
01:24:42,916 --> 01:24:44,418
No, Clancy.

883
01:24:53,802 --> 01:24:55,512
Oh, well, that's a shame.

884
01:24:58,307 --> 01:25:00,058
Harrison's blaming you for it.

885
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:01,560
Why?
ME?!

886
01:25:04,438 --> 01:25:07,441
And you expect me
to go back and help him?

887
01:25:08,692 --> 01:25:11,069
It's asking too much of a man.

888
01:25:12,613 --> 01:25:14,740
'Man', did you say?

889
01:25:14,781 --> 01:25:17,534
That's what my father raised me to be.

890
01:25:17,576 --> 01:25:19,036
Ah, yes.

891
01:25:19,077 --> 01:25:21,121
I often think of Henry Craig.

892
01:25:21,163 --> 01:25:22,831
He was a good man.

893
01:25:24,458 --> 01:25:27,586
Well...maybe it's just as well

894
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:31,507
Yeah, they probably wouldn't let him
ride with us anyway.

895
01:25:31,548 --> 01:25:33,008
No.

896
01:26:33,152 --> 01:26:34,695
Where's Clancy?

897
01:26:34,736 --> 01:26:36,196
He's not here.

898
01:26:36,238 --> 01:26:37,739
Goddamn it!

899
01:26:39,324 --> 01:26:41,493
We can't wait!

900
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,422
Gentlemen...

901
01:26:53,463 --> 01:26:57,176
..I appreciate the speed
with which you responded to my call.

902
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:01,805
My colt, the colt from Old Regret,

903
01:27:01,847 --> 01:27:05,434
is running with the most cunning mob
that ever crossed the ranges.

904
01:27:05,476 --> 01:27:07,144
Now, we must be careful.

905
01:27:08,979 --> 01:27:13,692
I've positioned scouts to send up flares
as soon as they're sighted.

906
01:27:21,658 --> 01:27:23,285
Thank you, Clancy.

907
01:27:23,327 --> 01:27:28,624
I need your help.
I'm ready.

908
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:31,460
Look at him.

909
01:27:33,462 --> 01:27:36,131
Come to survey his handiwork. Kane!

910
01:27:36,173 --> 01:27:38,759
If he'd done it, he wouldn't be here.

911
01:27:38,801 --> 01:27:41,220
You believe that?
Get him off my property.

912
01:27:42,304 --> 01:27:43,514
Hold it!

913
01:27:43,555 --> 01:27:46,225
Both he and his hourse are mountain bred...

914
01:27:46,266 --> 01:27:47,976
...I think he should come along.

915
01:27:48,018 --> 01:27:49,478
We don't need him.

916
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,939
I asked him.
You did what?

917
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:53,690
I want him along.

918
01:27:55,025 --> 01:27:56,527
As you wish.

919
01:27:57,736 --> 01:27:59,780
He'll dig his own grave.

920
01:28:03,534 --> 01:28:05,035
You ride with me.

921
01:28:11,959 --> 01:28:13,460
Come on!

922
01:28:14,086 --> 01:28:17,089
Gentlemen...

923
01:28:17,131 --> 01:28:21,510
..there will be a reward,
to be divided among you as you like,

924
01:28:21,552 --> 01:28:23,512
when the colt is recovered -

925
01:28:23,554 --> 01:28:25,055
£100.

926
01:29:17,149 --> 01:29:18,650
Hey!

927
01:29:18,692 --> 01:29:20,402
Mrs Bailey!

928
01:29:21,904 --> 01:29:24,531
Whoa! All the men have just left.

929
01:29:24,573 --> 01:29:26,033
Well...

930
01:29:26,074 --> 01:29:29,119
Where'd they go? Huh?!

931
01:29:29,161 --> 01:29:32,039
Oh, I so wanted to go with them.

932
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:36,585
But...somebody's got to stay here
and look after the womenfolk, right?

933
01:29:53,185 --> 01:29:54,853
How's he pulling up, Jim?

934
01:29:54,895 --> 01:29:58,023
Raring to go. Thanks for your help..

935
01:30:12,538 --> 01:30:14,373
Clancy, wheel 'em to the right.

936
01:30:17,417 --> 01:30:19,294
No fancy riding!

937
01:30:19,378 --> 01:30:21,380
We'll have them from the jump.

938
01:33:09,548 --> 01:33:13,427
MAN: Hey, Curly!
First bath for the week?

939
01:33:21,101 --> 01:33:22,603
Wait for me!

940
01:34:43,267 --> 01:34:45,769
You can bid the mob good day.

941
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:02,703
}Look!

942
01:37:04,533 --> 01:37:06,034
Where's Jim?

943
01:37:08,328 --> 01:37:10,164
STOCKMAN: Glory be!

944
01:37:10,205 --> 01:37:11,957
Will you look at that?!

945
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:36,685
Hey...
...promised £100.

946
01:39:36,727 --> 01:39:38,187
It's yours.

947
01:39:40,105 --> 01:39:41,815
That's not why I rode.

948
01:39:48,489 --> 01:39:51,408
There are a dozen good brood mares
in that mob.

949
01:39:51,450 --> 01:39:53,118
I'll be back for them.

950
01:39:58,415 --> 01:40:00,501
And for whatever else is mine.

951
01:40:00,542 --> 01:40:02,586
I don't like to repeat myself.

952
01:40:02,628 --> 01:40:04,213
She's not for you.

953
01:40:04,254 --> 01:40:06,757
Jessica can make up her own mind
about that.

954
01:40:06,799 --> 01:40:09,301
You've got a long way to go yet, lad.

955
01:40:09,343 --> 01:40:11,386
He's not a lad...brother.
