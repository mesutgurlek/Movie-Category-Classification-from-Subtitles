1
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:31,286
RIVERS OF BLOOD

2
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,311
What now?

3
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,379
No.

4
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,947
Not bother me.

5
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,052
I always irritate you.

6
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:27,779
I'm not filling.

7
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:31,483
No, but you do not let it go.
You have to put down!

8
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,991
- Do not do it.
- Yes!

9
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:35,286
I will not.

10
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,659
He decided he will not?

11
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,627
I'm not going anywhere ...

12
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,667
Go out!

13
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,968
- Not tonight.
- Yes tonight!

14
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,596
I'm not going anywhere ...

15
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,772
You will.

16
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,094
If you love me,
will change the station, please.

17
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,532
I'm trying.

18
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,634
What happened to that tape
we had?

19
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,740
- Ready.
- My God ...

20
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,246
- That's better.
- Really? Can not find something?

21
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,872
Shall I change back?

22
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,914
Wow. Who is that?

23
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,729
What is he doing here?

24
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,300
Keep going, Clark.

25
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,735
Are you sure it is very hot out there
want me to give him a ride?

26
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,169
Do not you dare.

27
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,297
That crazy guy.

28
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,935
SECURE YOUR FUEL
NO DESK IN 250KM

29
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,872
TOWARDS MOON

30
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,243
Just look for your key.

31
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,683
I'm new here
I'm still getting the hang of.

32
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,085
No problem.

33
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,716
I put back on the hook wrong.
Okay, you are on 108.

34
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,896
I just need a signature
and you can go.

35
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,295
Thank you.

36
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:58,794
Busy night for us in Lincoln.
We have three customers.

37
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:02,136
No doubt.
We have not seen a single car all day.

38
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,609
I am not surprised.
Anyway, enjoy your stay ...

39
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:08,479
and if they need something
just screaming.

40
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,482
Thank you, we will.

41
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,850
- Are you ready to go?
- Very ready.

42
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,787
Anything at all.

43
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,654
Honey ...

44
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,590
the bathroom is disgusting.

45
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,666
Yes, I do not think we got
suite of five stars.

46
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,698
Thought she
have liked me.

47
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,672
It definitely
liked you.

48
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,414
I guess I'll sleep
with my clothes.

49
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,584
Really?
I think I'll sleep in the car.

50
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,549
- Do you want the keys?
- Yes

51
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,154
You forgot something here.

52
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,650
Really?

53
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,561
More or less.

54
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:05,193
So, what can I do for you,
the same blue eyes?

55
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,795
Read my mind.

56
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,531
Bourbon, neat.

57
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,136
Use the same cup,
some memories in it. Good.

58
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:16,582
Sure.

59
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,344
If you're saying ...

60
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,679
Why not serve
one for you?

61
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,458
I can not,
I'm working.

62
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,026
I do not think anyone
will not mind.

63
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,562
As I always say ...

64
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,601
in doubt, faint.

65
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,776
Do you think he can hear us?

66
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,940
No, silly.
Are only a few months.

67
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:53,886
Well ..

68
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,046
just in case.

69
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,918
Good night, Junior.

70
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,128
VACANCY

71
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,065
There is in everyone's life
choice.

72
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,507
A fork in the road.

73
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,944
The path of righteousness
and a path of sin.

74
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:28,117
For every action
is a consequence ...

75
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,750
and for each sin
is a punishment.

76
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:38,422
You have spurned the punishment
and each trial ...

77
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,460
and I pass
one hand against the other ...

78
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,332
and shall discharge the fury
do, sir ...

79
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,566
for I am His messenger ...

80
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,301
and the Lord commanded.

81
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,908
The Lord commanded.

82
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:03,255
There is no one there.

83
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,654
- What do you mean?
- I do not know, is weird.

84
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,122
I left the key on the table
with some money.

85
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:09,791
You left what we?

86
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,057
- Yes, it must cover the expense.
- Okay.

87
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,223
Ready to go?

88
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,047
She has drugs ...

89
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,450
she is addicted.

90
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,517
She only has enough
to survive.

91
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,356
Then she got nothing.

92
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,019
Okay, dear.

93
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,659
It's okay.

94
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,499
She was flawed because
operations.

95
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:31,375
She can not live
without drugs.

96
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:35,010
She takes morphine enough
to kill an elephant.

97
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,576
- She takes morphine every day.
- Angie ...

98
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,883
God you must trust.

99
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,890
Everything happens for a reason.

100
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,524
We pray to God
help us in the world.

101
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,123
Okay.

102
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,170
The Lord is merciful.

103
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,234
The Lord is merciful.

104
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,876
Help this woman, God.
Tell me something about this woman.

105
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:10,040
When she was fifteen years ...

106
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,248
Amen

107
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:14,809
Since then, almost all
the years she required surgery.

108
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,986
One year she had four.

109
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:21,120
And they gave this medication
pain ...

110
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,821
but now it has become
dependent on the medication.

111
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,329
- That's what it takes?
- Yes

112
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,300
Who takes it?

113
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,538
It takes two for nerves ...

114
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,971
four sleeping pills
and a dose of Demerol ...

115
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,135
every night
bedtime.

116
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,281
I'm enjoying it
this trip, Summer.

117
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:53,619
What?

118
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:56,989
I'm just saying
I'm enjoying.

119
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,031
- You changed the text.
- Do not get me wrong ...

120
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,431
I'm still not so
to tell their parents.

121
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:06,264
I'm just enjoying the journey
much more than I thought it would.

122
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,966
They will be happy.

123
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,268
They stayed with Benny
for two weeks ...

124
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,242
be more willing
to have more grandchildren.

125
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:15,939
I know, but his father still will give me
sermon on the responsibility.

126
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,912
Clark
a baby is not a toy ...

127
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:22,851
the day comes when a man
must face its responsibilities.

128
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,990
He has good intentions.

129
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:28,285
I know,
but it is always the same conversation.

130
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,726
Clark
a house is not a toy.

131
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,661
Clark
a dog is not a toy.

132
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,496
Clark
a woman is not a toy.

133
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,195
Well, he is casting his
his own image.

134
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,971
Ours
that scary thought.

135
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,181
Honey ...

136
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,398
Baby, you okay?

137
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,997
I do not know.

138
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,535
Okay ...

139
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,695
I'm going ...

140
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,168
alright, alright ...

141
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,777
all is well.

142
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,538
Grab my arm.

143
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:58,650
Here ...

144
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,145
lean against his car.

145
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,286
- Are you in pain?
- My baby!

146
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:07,785
I know ...

147
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,849
i know.

148
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,927
- Look at me, look at me.
- God, God.

149
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,167
It's okay, take that shirt,
take that shirt.

150
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,271
Wow.

151
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:31,714
Come on.

152
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,679
Come on!

153
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,192
Come on!

154
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,659
Come on.

155
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:44,819
Please.

156
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,672
Drugs.

157
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,939
What is it, Clark?

158
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,547
The tire burst.

159
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,079
- I have to pick up the spare.
- Okay.

160
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,128
- What is it?
- What?

161
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,326
- Damn!
- What? What is it, Clark?

162
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:23,196
- There are no drugs steppe.
- You do not put a spare tire?

163
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,635
I put the spare back in LA,
darling.

164
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,899
Then someone came and stole the spare tire,
Clark?

165
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,772
- I do not know, maybe.
- Who steals a spare?

166
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:35,574
I do not know, Summer, all I know
is that I put the spare here.

167
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:40,379
Damn, damn, damn!

168
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,925
Please stay well,
please, it's okay.

169
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,394
Sorry, baby, sorry.

170
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:57,728
Please stay well,
please, it's okay.

171
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,302
I promise you,
I take her to a doctor, okay?

172
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,436
I'll take it to be examined.

173
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:08,945
Sure.

174
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,525
You can see where we are?

175
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,361
Yes, I could see.

176
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:38,408
There is a town about eight,
nine kilometers in this direction.

177
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,040
As we walk eight,
nine kilometers, Clark?

178
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,705
Summer, listen ...

179
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:47,218
the motel where we came
is more than 80km beyond.

180
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,913
The city is eight,
nine kilometers in this direction.

181
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:53,024
Well, I think we should be
with the car? I mean, what if ...

182
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,959
Summer, baby, we saw a car
throughout the day.

183
00:14:56,128 --> 00:15:00,360
If we start to walk
and we walk on this road ...

184
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,330
and a car comes,
he'll see us ...

185
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,660
and will
to the next town.

186
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,669
- I do not know, Clark.
- Baby, it's our only option.

187
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,403
Okay?

188
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,045
Okay.

189
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,274
Okay, what's the name?

190
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,816
Show me.

191
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,018
Rivers of Blood.

192
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,210
Great.

193
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,517
Drugs.

194
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,557
Okay. So what do we do?

195
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,027
Let's walk.

196
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,117
It seems to be 1000 º C.

197
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:03,153
I'm just saying ...

198
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,035
I wanted to say something ...

199
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,675
Is it broken?

200
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,340
Not any more.

201
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,613
Of course not.

202
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,147
Of course not.
You kidding?

203
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,277
We're almost there.
I promise you.

204
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:06,719
Okay.

205
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,521
That's right.

206
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,059
Come on. Raising ...

207
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,659
Support your arm on me.

208
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,430
This.

209
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,900
It is not fun?

210
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,342
Clark?

211
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,641
Thank God.

212
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,291
Is anyone there?

213
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,566
Hello?

214
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,904
Hello?

215
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,244
Is anyone there? Hello?

216
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,677
Nobody. Nobody.

217
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,019
Is anyone there?

218
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,783
Is anyone there? Hello?

219
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,594
Is anyone there?

220
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,758
You must be kidding me.

221
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,027
All right, baby.
Let's find some water.

222
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,128
There's nobody here, Clark.

223
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,868
Clark.

224
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,612
Come here, baby. It's okay.
Let's find something, okay?

225
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:42,952
Hello?

226
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,193
Where are you going, Clark?

227
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:52,423
Clark?

228
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,303
Clark?

229
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,534
- It's okay.
- No. ..

230
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,746
- It's okay.
- Not all is well.

231
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,042
We will find
a little water.

232
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:12,481
Trust me.

233
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,313
Trust me.

234
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,582
It's okay.

235
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,620
Come.

236
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,116
Let's find something. Come.

237
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,275
Clark.

238
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:46,848
Yes?

239
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,785
I worried
with our baby.

240
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,249
Come here, I am too.

241
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,853
I am also,
but it will be alright.

242
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,396
How do you know?

243
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,023
How do I know?

244
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,028
Because we resolve this.

245
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,139
We'll take her to a doctor
and you will be examined.

246
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,598
Listen to me.

247
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,707
We have a little fighter
in there, okay?

248
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,446
He must be laughing now ...

249
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,813
and wondering why
your mother is so upset.

250
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,148
God, I hope so.

251
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,451
You only have to think positive,
okay?

252
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:35,597
I'll take a look around,
see if I can find something.

253
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,861
You stay here, okay?

254
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,233
- Do not go away.
- I will not.

255
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,708
Okay?

256
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,772
I will not take.

257
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:16,992
Come on!

258
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,272
Damn!

259
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,535
Damn!

260
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:49,398
Keep track, Clark.
Keep control.

261
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:09,013
Drugs.

262
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,299
Clark.

263
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,427
Clark?

264
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:03,567
Clark?

265
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:21,390
Clark?

266
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,842
Clark?

267
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,976
Clark?

268
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:20,912
Clark?

269
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,710
Clark?

270
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,179
What happened?

271
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,221
See.

272
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,453
See.

273
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,156
Wow, wait a minute.

274
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,165
Are you kidding me?

275
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,704
We thought we were
alone out here.

276
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,899
Sorry to disappoint them.
Nice to meet you.

277
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,470
You have no idea
that it is good to see someone.

278
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,678
Well, it's a great "welcome"
a stranger.

279
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,516
- What are you doing out here?
- We had a car accident.

280
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,145
We had a burst tire,
the worst I've ever seen.

281
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,191
And we do not have a spare tire.

282
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,455
It is a bold man for driving
the desert without a spare tire.

283
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,428
- Actually I had ...
- What is your name, traveler?

284
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,696
Clark Ewald
nice to meet you.

285
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:15,638
Ewald, how to spell?

286
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,569
As is pronounced ...

287
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,971
and you are?

288
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,305
Joseph ...

289
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,375
how it is pronounced.

290
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:26,348
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you,
Joseph.

291
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:32,452
Wow, look at you,
are all injured.

292
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,025
Well, we had to walk the car
far, then ...

293
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,855
Your baby is well?

294
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:37,929
Yes ..

295
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,892
I think so ...

296
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,160
I hope so.

297
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,560
So what is your story,
Joseph?

298
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,999
The old story
running out of petrol.

299
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:51,072
I saw this place on the map
and started walking.

300
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,141
I thought I would get
some help here.

301
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:56,270
Should not have gone to work
is a ghost town.

302
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:59,542
I see it now. There are holidays
I had planned.

303
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,184
No, not for us.

304
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:04,221
We are across the state
to visit my parents.

305
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,980
Well, that's cool.

306
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,553
Yes, if we get there.

307
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:13,130
Well,
I have to say ...

308
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,926
I would not mind
stop in the shade.

309
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:19,129
It's hotter than a stand
hot dog in hell, right?

310
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:22,104
Yes, clear,
will accompany him.

311
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,808
I would offer you a drink
or something to eat, but ...

312
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:27,538
Allow me. I always carry a bottle
of rum in my purse.

313
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:30,945
You never know when you will encounter
lost to Los Angeles.

314
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,284
This kind of thing happens to you
often?

315
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:36,679
More often
than you think.

316
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,552
Take my bag, friends.

317
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:42,957
What?

318
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,459
Do not worry about me, friends.

319
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:52,833
- Come on, Clark.
- I'm going.

320
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:05,481
Is the following ...

321
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,515
I serve it for drinking.

322
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,851
No, I should not.
Accept a little water, if any.

323
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,787
A water coming out.

324
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:35,071
- This is good.
- Thank you.

325
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:40,013
You want me to take a look
arm. I have some material.

326
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:42,210
I'm fine, thanks.

327
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:44,479
Well, if you change your mind.

328
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:49,926
And the baby of you?

329
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,460
I see you still worried.

330
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,457
Would you mind if I ...

331
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,404
Bright.

332
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,539
It's okay, just relax.

333
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,228
I felt something.

334
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:27,958
You still have a glow about you.
The baby is fine.

335
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:31,057
Well, it's good to know.
You hear that, Clark?

336
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:33,463
I'm sitting right here.

337
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,867
What is your next step, pal?

338
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,935
Now know this place
dead.

339
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,703
It's a good question.

340
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:45,039
I think back to the road
and expect a car to pass.

341
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,175
I can not believe
we walk up here for nothing.

342
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,213
Well ..

343
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:54,423
I went up and down
this road a few times.

344
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,094
You may have to wait
a good time.

345
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:59,390
If you have a better idea
I'd like to hear it.

346
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,024
Well, it's too late now ...

347
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,330
the sun will set.

348
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:07,266
It will be dark before you know it.

349
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:11,401
But I think in the morning,
can go to his car ...

350
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:15,206
take a little gasoline,
bring to my'll take the road.

351
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,175
Well, there are cars out there
maybe we can check them out first.

352
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,976
If gasoline
this lot of rust ...

353
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:26,022
then I'm Mary ...

354
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:28,922
and that I'm not.

355
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:35,931
There is a motel with a gas station
80km back.

356
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,228
Yes, I know,
is where we came from.

357
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,267
Well, this is the best
I have.

358
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,665
Yes, that sounds like a plan.

359
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,110
Okay, then.

360
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,583
Meanwhile
it is better to light a fire.

361
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,149
It's cold in the desert at night.

362
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,150
What do you say, buddy?

363
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,124
Let me get firewood?

364
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,021
Of course, we do.

365
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,854
Okay.

366
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:13,864
Everything will be okay, honey?

367
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,003
Yes, I will survive.

368
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,699
Okay.

369
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,525
- This wood is good.
- Yes

370
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,797
Listen ...

371
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,337
be frank with me,
what are our chances here?

372
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,873
How so?

373
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,601
What are our chances
out of here?

374
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:55,236
Of being rescued.

375
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:58,547
- You want the truth?
- Yes

376
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,212
I'd say your chances
are not large.

377
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,577
Well ..

378
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,627
I'll talk to my wife
that all is well ...

379
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:12,996
and certainly
get out of here.

380
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:15,593
And you do the same, okay?

381
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,726
So will two liars,
not?

382
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:23,338
Yes, I think so.

383
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,504
Do not get me wrong,
still want to get out of here ...

384
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,314
but until things change ...

385
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:34,283
you and I will twist
the truth a little.

386
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:38,219
You do not have
to explain to me.

387
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,653
But must respond to Jesus.

388
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,286
What?

389
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,259
I'm just playing with you,
dude.

390
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:48,992
Understood.
We have to stick together, right?

391
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,132
That's right.

392
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:54,096
Can I keep the secret
also if you can.

393
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:57,841
So that's what we do.

394
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,002
To the grave.

395
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,913
There is only one more thing.

396
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,210
Say.

397
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,947
I do not like people putting
hands on my wife.

398
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:15,386
If you do this again
you and I have a problem.

399
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:19,594
Yes, sir, you're the boss.

400
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,759
I was just
being nice.

401
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:25,428
Cool, be nice otherwise
okay?

402
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,433
I do this.

403
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,428
How are you, princess?

404
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:55,221
Well, considering ...

405
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:59,703
Owner not want to talk too much ...

406
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:03,032
but her husband just ask me
about our chances to get out of here.

407
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:04,233
Really?

408
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:05,536
Well ..

409
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:09,207
He asked me not to say
what I said to him ...

410
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:12,145
but I think we
in the same boat ...

411
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,911
everyone deserves to know
what's going on.

412
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,782
Why he does not want
you tell me?

413
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:21,585
I do not know, maybe he has found
you would panic.

414
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:22,989
Panic?

415
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:27,029
I think we all need to know
the true situation.

416
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,071
What's going on?

417
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,266
Why do not you tell me, Clark?

418
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,006
Say what, dear?

419
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,139
About his conversation with Joseph
just now.

420
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,340
I just ...

421
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,849
I did not want to worry,
that's all.

422
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:55,688
Well, now I wonder
All conversations, okay?

423
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,794
No secrets.

424
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:02,022
It seems fair. What you say, Clark?
No more secrets.

425
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:06,696
Okay. No secrets.

426
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:17,948
Listen ...

427
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,448
know I never lie
you.

428
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,818
Just do not hide anything from me,
Clark.

429
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:42,936
Thanks again
the food.

430
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,132
No need to thank.

431
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:50,908
This will be your first child?

432
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,813
No, we have a son.

433
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,444
Well, I have a son ...

434
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,624
before Clark.
His name is Ben. He has five years.

435
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:04,090
Stepfather, that's cool.

436
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,996
Five is a good age ...

437
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,860
not lost to civilization
up to five years ...

438
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:13,062
- I still have some spirit.
- What do you mean?

439
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:16,836
- Your child goes to school?
- Yes, of course.

440
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,133
Learning to be a man.

441
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,609
How to get a job,
working for the man.

442
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:25,682
Got a problem with that?
Got a problem with the authorities?

443
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:28,284
Here, a picture of Ben.

444
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,183
It's a smart kid.

445
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,861
And to answer your question,
You ...

446
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,398
there are only two authorities
I know of ...

447
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,433
I am one and the other, God ...

448
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,568
and have no problem
with any of them.

449
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,598
You just do not think that children
should be educated ...

450
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:50,936
Clark.

451
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,873
Okay, I'm just trying to understand
what you are saying.

452
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:55,537
All right, man.
It's okay.

453
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:59,143
Think
as a smokescreen.

454
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,249
You put the children
schools ...

455
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:03,549
so they do not know
what is actually happening.

456
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:07,584
They are using their fingers
with mathematics and geography ...

457
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,592
while the crap
is falling over the rest of us.

458
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:13,226
Well ..

459
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,560
let me say this,
will not always be so ...

460
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:20,227
as long
bury our heads in the sand.

461
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:23,463
It's time to light the fire
under the back of some people.

462
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,833
You're a revolutionary.

463
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,209
No, ma'am, I do not.
I'm just the messenger.

464
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:32,281
What is the message?

465
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:36,011
Do not say you
should never talk about politics?

466
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,083
Absolutely.

467
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,314
Politics and religion.

468
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,725
You're a religious man,
Clark?

469
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,660
You are right
that I can not try it?

470
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:55,666
- No thanks, I'm sure.
- This is the right answer.

471
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,972
- Here.
- Thank you.

472
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:04,912
Well ..

473
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:08,782
is a beautiful night.

474
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,099
I swear, was the longest day.

475
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:33,606
Well, I better get some sleep.

476
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,636
Staying up is superficial.

477
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:38,806
When you are sleeping
you dream ...

478
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:41,679
and is when you are dreaming
that is when the truth comes.

479
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:46,087
So where you live, Jo,
where are you from?

480
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,851
If you're asking
where I put my head ...

481
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,688
I'll tell where I can ...

482
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,450
but if you ask
where I live ...

483
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,394
I'll say in my mind.

484
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,159
A man can be king
his own mind.

485
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,268
But what is the advantage of being
a king in his own mind ...

486
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,804
if nobody cares?

487
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:02,463
Clark!

488
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:05,901
My Father cares.

489
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:10,071
I was not talking
you specifically.

490
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:14,415
Suppose that, relatively speaking,
in the grand scheme of things ...

491
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:16,953
you and I are useless.

492
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:21,354
But in your head you are a king,
so what Big deal.

493
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:25,154
What is the problem, Clark?
You think you're useless?

494
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,430
They do not listen to you?
People do not respect him?

495
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,863
People respect me.

496
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,834
If people do not see me
what should ...

497
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,064
only means that will be the first
to be burned ...

498
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,166
when I lift
in front of them.

499
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,809
You really
is a revolutionary.

500
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:43,971
No.

501
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:48,347
See, a revolution involves something
that is going around.

502
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:52,445
What I do have a defined beginning
and a very definite purpose.

503
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:55,084
And what you do, Joseph?

504
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,621
What I want.

505
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,099
I'm free as a bird.

506
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:18,609
Anyway, I think the girl
want to sleep a little ...

507
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,280
and I suggest you do
the same thing ...

508
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,115
have a walk tomorrow
soldier.

509
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:26,084
Yes, you're right.

510
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:31,627
Meanwhile I will "drain my lizard"
then I will also rest.

511
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,592
Sleep well
we see in the morning.

512
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,831
Yes, sleep well.

513
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,703
Wow.

514
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:45,364
- So, what do you think?
- About what?

515
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,770
About Joseph, cute.

516
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:51,982
It's a little crazy
but it seems a good guy.

517
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:53,743
You think?

518
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,219
Think. Do not you think?

519
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:58,218
I do not know.

520
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,447
He seems a bit strange.

521
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:04,383
- He is just a free spirit.
- Really?

522
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:08,693
Yes, a "crazy beautiful"
a hippie.

523
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:10,923
No need to worry ...

524
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:13,503
they are all "peace and love"
baby.

525
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,734
- Really?
- Sure.

526
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:19,108
I know many guys like him
college.

527
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:21,007
Of course yes.

528
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,437
Not so.

529
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,140
Now go to sleep.

530
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,562
Good night, Clark.

531
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:06,278
Clark ...

532
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:07,888
What is the problem?

533
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:10,517
You saw my picture of Benny?

534
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:15,256
No, the last time I was
Joseph when he showed last night.

535
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:16,856
I returned it!

536
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:21,162
I know.
This is strange.

537
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:23,136
I have put
in my bag, but ...

538
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,832
But what?

539
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:30,142
I do not know, it's weird.
I can not find it.

540
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:33,007
Okay, must have lost
inside. Let's find.

541
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:39,086
Joseph, what time we leave?

542
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:42,657
We? No, no, dear.
You will stay here.

543
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:43,852
What?

544
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:48,363
- It will be very far and it's hot ...
- But I do not want to stay here.

545
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:49,955
He's right.

546
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:53,735
You need rest, need to take care
the baby she is carrying.

547
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:57,136
I really do not want
be left alone.

548
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:00,505
I mean
I'll be safe?

549
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:03,203
It makes sense, face,
can not leave it here.

550
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:06,908
I need a man
to help me.

551
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,214
You are a man, right, Clark?

552
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:13,620
She comes with us.

553
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:15,722
It looks like it will
anyway.

554
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:17,784
"She" is right here!

555
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:22,331
Darling,
your car is in this direction.

556
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,297
My car is there are eight,
nine kilometers in this direction.

557
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,995
It's a long walk
for a pregnant lady.

558
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:31,641
Especially someone
as beautiful as you.

559
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,402
Shall I leave them alone?

560
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:36,503
You will not leave me here,
Clark.

561
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:46,346
So what do we do?

562
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:53,291
Now, do not be alarmed, but ...

563
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:59,269
I travel a lot and you can come
find very strange types.

564
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:04,004
I do not know
I really do not like guns.

565
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:05,439
Not me, ma'am.

566
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:09,811
But if we leave it alone,
at least can defend itself.

567
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:13,314
Summer, he's right.

568
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,809
Okay.

569
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,823
Stand up, lady.

570
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,493
Now, spread your legs.

571
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:29,392
Joseph, what are you doing?

572
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:33,094
I'll teach her how to use the piece.

573
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:35,102
- Do you mind?
- No.

574
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,108
You are about to shoot a man
or will make a salad?

575
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:40,668
I'm about to shoot
a man.

576
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:42,575
Well, then, act as if
shoot a man.

577
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,045
Arm straight and strong.

578
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:46,072
That, good.

579
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:49,250
Now, there is no security.

580
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:53,720
So if something happens,
what will not, but if this happens ...

581
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:58,158
you gun and pull the trigger,
okay?

582
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:05,835
Gun and pulls the trigger.

583
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:10,100
Sure.

584
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:12,703
That's good.

585
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,009
Good

586
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:19,849
Now think
is not your man ...

587
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:22,582
but it is a bad man
truth.

588
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,488
Arma ...

589
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:34,259
Do not point that thing
me.

590
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:45,670
"Bang."
The victim falls, end of the game.

591
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,074
Justice was done.

592
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,478
I understand.

593
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,250
He's crazy.

594
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:15,632
Listen ...

595
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,506
Sorry
get it to sound like.

596
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:23,169
Okay. I'll be fine.

597
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:24,339
Really?

598
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:28,110
Is. I sit here
and my brown ...

599
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:30,578
and shoot anyone
try to hurt me.

600
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:32,281
This is my girl.

601
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:34,180
Listen ...

602
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:36,951
we soon
we can ...

603
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,722
but still be a few hours,
so do not worry, okay?

604
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,128
Okay.

605
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,033
You're ready, cowboy?

606
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:51,904
Absolutely.

607
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:55,201
Just do not delay, okay?

608
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:58,646
Do not linger. I promise.
If you're lucky will be driving.

609
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,975
It is here, purple pants.

610
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:04,345
It is a good start.

611
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:09,582
I love you.

612
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,129
We are just you and me now, Junior.

613
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:26,239
What was that?

614
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:27,602
What do you mean?

615
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,703
Do you think it is smart to point
a loaded gun at someone?

616
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,042
Well, it all depends on who is.

617
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:33,344
Well, you pointed a loaded gun
for me, smart guy.

618
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:36,716
What is the problem, Superman?
You can not dodge a bullet?

619
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:41,079
Just do not give me another way,
okay?

620
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:43,217
This
is bad enough ...

621
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,088
I need you acting strange
like I need a hole in the head.

622
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,096
It will be a fun ride.

623
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:50,995
Believe me
I'm enjoying more than you.

624
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:54,666
We can at least try ...

625
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,266
Once you get to my car
and manage the fuel ...

626
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:00,640
which is the distance to yours?

627
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,042
Far.

628
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:05,570
Sure.
I forgot, Mr. Prince.

629
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:07,844
You have to stop it,
dude.

630
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:09,977
Concentrate your mind
what we are doing ...

631
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,954
and not how long it will take
or how difficult it will be.

632
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,921
It's very hot here.

633
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:17,222
I should have brought his sandals,
dude.

634
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,591
Have you noticed how the only people
that really sweat ...

635
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:21,153
and I mean really sweat ...

636
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:24,666
are the sons of a bitch who can not
stop complaining about the heat?

637
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,894
I can not say I've noticed.

638
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:30,731
I mean, you see
a drop of sweat on me, cowboy?

639
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:33,966
I'm from the city.
I'm not used to it.

640
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:38,012
Everything, and I mean everything,
is a state of mind, man.

641
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:39,648
Really?

642
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:42,576
What about death?

643
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:46,850
If you do not tidy up this car,
we learn.

644
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,717
I know one thing,
she comes to us all.

645
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:51,283
There is no point crying about it ...

646
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:53,989
and certainly does not make sense
cry about it before.

647
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,428
Wow!

648
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:59,095
- What is funny?
- You, man.

649
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:01,694
You are like a box
of fortune cookies or something.

650
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,137
Not believe it.

651
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:07,165
You are very close, is restricted.
You need to drop a little.

652
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:09,610
You say that like
met me.

653
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:12,507
I know, boy.

654
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:16,610
I know him.

655
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,485
You have a job
In ...

656
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:21,347
is very well paid ...

657
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,052
wears a suit and tie,
makes you feel important.

658
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:29,496
But in mid-afternoon on a hot day,
you unbutton the top button, right?

659
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:33,093
His concession to society.
Your badge of honor.

660
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,940
Undid the top button,
I have worked hard today.

661
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:39,066
You never had a day
working hard in your life ...

662
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:42,040
never worked until blood
and the sweat run down into the mud ...

663
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:45,513
- Staining their shoes.
- I see a lot of sweat ...

664
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,376
The rest of the world is
struggling and debating ...

665
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:50,352
fighting, settling and crying ...

666
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,945
blood, shit, sperm
and tears flying through the air ...

667
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:56,823
knocking on his face.
Only you do not see, man. You do not see.

668
00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:59,391
Because you
sits in his tower ...

669
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:03,897
where their shutters down
to protect him from the pain of the world.

670
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:08,768
You see, I know.
I know you, pilgrim.

671
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:20,350
Because sometimes, you see much
when it is buried in the mud ...

672
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:26,178
than when sitting
in his office on the 12th floor.

673
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:30,853
My office actually
is on the 12th floor.

674
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:33,191
You see ... I told him.
I know him.

675
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:37,561
You define your paths.
You, hippies.

676
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:39,067
I will not pretend that I agree
with them, but ...

677
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:42,936
Hear what he says, Mr. America.
I'm not a hippie.

678
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:45,738
It's the way I see
and the things I say ...

679
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:48,606
is a reflection of their society,
and ideals.

680
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:52,704
The only truth is here
in my mind.

681
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:56,018
I'm not a hippie, man.

682
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:02,558
And you can be sure that
in my mind, fire up their cities.

683
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,576
About the devil ...

684
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:04,483
you have to know
the truth of the scriptures.

685
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:26,075
Our ...

686
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:44,057
How long
is with your wife?

687
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:48,394
Why do you ask
about my wife?

688
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:51,728
I'm just trying to talk,
trying to be friendly.

689
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:02,510
Are married
18 months ago ...

690
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:05,013
and six months
before marriage.

691
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,344
It has a good set.

692
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,147
A beautiful wife, a baby on the way,
a big house ...

693
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,620
bet, two cars,
not?

694
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:18,186
Yes, I am very lucky.

695
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,688
I think some people just
do not know how lucky you are.

696
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,792
How?

697
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:29,437
Well ..

698
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:33,470
not believe that
a real person, Clark.

699
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,442
You know nothing about me.

700
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:40,480
I know a little.

701
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:42,949
What are you talking about?

702
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:46,847
I just know its type, is all.

703
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:49,552
Funny ...

704
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,622
At first I called him a hippie,
remember?

705
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:57,428
And you referred me to his sermon
of how the world is unfair.

706
00:53:57,534 --> 00:54:00,162
Now you're telling me
you know my type?

707
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:02,601
I'm not talking
on how to dress ...

708
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,469
or the work you have,
or people he meets.

709
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:08,737
I'm talking
the man inside.

710
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,444
His soul.

711
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,675
You are totally crazy
know that?

712
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,746
I could say the same thing
about you.

713
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:25,260
The only difference is
I looked in his mind.

714
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,256
You know nothing about me ...

715
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:33,467
then we cut the crop,
okay?

716
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,739
Okay ...

717
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,477
but the truth
appear at the end.

718
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:46,911
You can not hide
forever.

719
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:51,051
If you do not deal with it
the truth will put you on your knees.

720
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:55,391
Yeah, and he alone, whose heart is pure,
I do not know what else ...

721
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,893
You are bothering me
with this thing.

722
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:00,690
This is probably guilty.

723
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:02,959
This ends with a man.

724
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:07,663
There is a way back ...

725
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,940
just have to know
when to take it.

726
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:24,385
Thank you.
I'll remember that.

727
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:27,245
Hippie ...

728
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:10,759
Hello?

729
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:16,499
Hello?

730
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:19,440
Thousands in the world today are being
dominated, influenced, controlled ...

731
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:23,036
and driven by demons,
without actually being possessed by them.

732
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:26,945
A person can be so overwhelmed
and vexed by demons ...

733
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:29,177
is not really different
to be possessed by them.

734
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:31,010
Some people are so connected
demonic powers ...

735
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:32,349
Is there anybody there?

736
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:34,185
They are not themselves.

737
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:38,125
Devils may cry
or cry with voices ...

738
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:40,788
using their lips and tongue.

739
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:46,294
Demons can torment
people ...

740
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:50,998
and may, in turn,
be tormented by people.

741
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:53,335
It is a known fact
a legion of demons ...

742
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:56,741
may be in a person
the same time.

743
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,972
How many of you will laugh?

744
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:02,413
I say that demons can preach
and they do.

745
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:06,244
Demons can tell lies,
and do you believe and tell lies.

746
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:11,383
Demons can make you a thief
according to the word of God.

747
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:14,622
They can arise,
floor and need rest.

748
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:18,326
All this is founded
the scriptures.

749
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:22,102
It is quite possible that at some
time in the past ...

750
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:26,106
you had your fortune read
by a demon.

751
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:30,009
Once a demon spear
a boy on fire to destroy it.

752
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:33,274
It will also launch the water
for the same purpose.

753
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:35,146
Demons ...

754
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:37,350
Hello?

755
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,314
Hello?

756
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,851
Hello?

757
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:14,919
Use in moderation, dude.

758
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:21,821
Thank God we did.

759
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:26,591
Of course we can.
Just a walk in the park.

760
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:30,866
I hope Summer is well.

761
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:33,075
She's fine.

762
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:36,608
But it should be more concerned
with their own situation.

763
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:41,016
What do you mean?

764
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:43,878
Things are not always
what they seem.

765
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:48,546
Shame on you, if someone
let the bones out of the closet.

766
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:52,351
What?

767
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,964
Everyone has a secret
Clark.

768
00:58:56,766 --> 00:58:59,234
I wonder what is yours.

769
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:02,934
You want to share with me?

770
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,437
You do not know me, man.

771
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:09,872
Okay.

772
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:14,675
You really did a number
about it.

773
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,383
I open the lid of the tank.

774
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,024
You have traveled
the path with me this day.

775
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:37,033
You had the opportunity of confession
and repentance and you rejected it.

776
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:44,436
His only hope now
is telling the truth.

777
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:47,579
But you will not.

778
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,148
No, you will not.

779
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,949
So be it.

780
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:57,018
His penance awaits.

781
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:03,090
I'm getting tired of ...

782
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:10,738
Hello?

783
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:15,309
Hey.

784
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:53,647
What?

785
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:58,285
Ben?

786
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:06,754
Clark.

787
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:15,289
God!

788
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:21,330
God! Benny!

789
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:27,303
God!

790
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,261
What's happening?

791
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:51,527
Where's Clark?

792
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,164
He will come.

793
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:00,273
What is this place?

794
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:04,341
That's where the sinner comes to die.

795
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:08,377
You did that?

796
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:11,852
Honey, these people
did it to themselves.

797
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:17,684
Do not approach me.

798
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,257
How ironic, is not it?

799
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,066
Are you afraid of me now.

800
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:28,530
Can not wait
her prince ...

801
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:30,071
back to the city
and save.

802
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:35,035
But the thought
is at odds with the truth.

803
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:38,210
What are you talking about?

804
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:41,048
Man you love ...

805
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:44,079
is much more dangerous
than you or me.

806
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:46,915
He sinned.

807
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:52,454
All he likes
will be crushed.

808
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:56,124
All that love will be punished.

809
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:57,389
No.

810
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:01,601
I'm afraid so.

811
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:12,847
God!

812
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:20,281
Get away.

813
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,350
Stay away.

814
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:25,317
You cried for the weak ...

815
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:28,089
but they chose
their own way.

816
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:34,161
They decide their fate when
cheat, steal, lie and fornicate.

817
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:37,966
When you take a life
or steal a purse ...

818
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:42,505
or look for his friend's wife
eyed cobiçantes.

819
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:43,669
His actions ...

820
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:46,942
their lies
weaknesses ...

821
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:49,382
sins.

822
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:53,987
Clark ...

823
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,025
Clark is a good person.

824
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:01,719
No!

825
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,756
No!

826
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:15,472
You're a good person.

827
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:18,805
No.

828
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,049
But it is weak ...

829
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:23,579
and blind.

830
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:30,491
I promise I'll raise the scales.

831
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:34,592
'll Shine the light ...

832
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:37,391
the Lord in every crevice.

833
01:05:38,968 --> 01:05:40,765
I light every shadow.

834
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:43,834
The light will shine in the darkness.

835
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:47,001
Everyone will know
the truth finally.

836
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:54,348
No!

837
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:08,563
Você ..

838
01:06:10,933 --> 01:06:12,764
have faith in God, Summer?

839
01:06:13,836 --> 01:06:15,804
Do you believe in God?

840
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:22,668
Yes

841
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:27,581
So if comfort in knowing that everything
What happens here is His will.

842
01:06:28,884 --> 01:06:30,146
And only Him.

843
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:52,104
Look at you.

844
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,245
You are beautiful.

845
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:03,045
Is an angel.

846
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:21,959
Damn!

847
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:23,070
Damn!

848
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:25,173
Drugs, Summer! Summer!

849
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,107
Summer!

850
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,886
Do not worry,
are not for you.

851
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:27,859
This is for you.

852
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:36,301
No, no!

853
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,004
Please!

854
01:08:38,814 --> 01:08:40,748
No need to do this.

855
01:08:44,053 --> 01:08:45,281
No!

856
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,514
Yes I do.

857
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:52,417
I'm just the bearer.

858
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,596
It is my will.

859
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:56,623
No!

860
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:02,033
The life grows within you.

861
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:05,906
Innocent of the sins of the father.

862
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:14,845
It belongs to me,
more than you.

863
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,788
It's as if I myself
had planted the seed.

864
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,354
No, no, no.

865
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:24,950
No!

866
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:55,746
It is my son now.

867
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:57,518
No! No!

868
01:10:00,729 --> 01:10:02,356
Can you feel me?

869
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:06,531
You can not do that.

870
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:23,850
No.

871
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:48,102
It's time to leave
dad bravo.

872
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:49,842
No, no.

873
01:10:57,019 --> 01:10:57,951
No.

874
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:37,615
You've been betrayed.

875
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:41,861
And it will take this brand
until the end of his days ...

876
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:43,998
not to forget.

877
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,271
Now you can scream.

878
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:51,401
Clark!

879
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:55,240
Clark!

880
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:06,713
Come!

881
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:48,322
Summer!

882
01:12:50,099 --> 01:12:51,259
Here he comes.

883
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:07,677
Summer!

884
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:31,602
Summer!

885
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:36,936
Clark?

886
01:13:37,446 --> 01:13:38,470
Clark?

887
01:13:40,649 --> 01:13:41,673
Summer?

888
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:54,229
Clark!

889
01:13:55,898 --> 01:13:57,331
Honey? Summer?

890
01:13:58,467 --> 01:13:59,399
God!

891
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:00,565
Darling.

892
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:05,707
It's all right, all right.

893
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:20,554
Bastard!

894
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:23,223
Bastard!
What caused it?

895
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:24,526
I'll kill you!

896
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:02,790
Your unborn child ...

897
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:04,425
belongs to me now.

898
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:14,798
This is even necessary, man?

899
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:18,302
As we get out?

900
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:22,937
You know even use it?

901
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:25,035
Shut up.

902
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:26,169
Why?

903
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:28,873
If not I will kill you!

904
01:16:30,886 --> 01:16:34,117
You can not kill me.
You can not kill me.

905
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:37,189
I am not of this world.

906
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:39,552
You created this monster.

907
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:42,692
You even asked for it.

908
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:50,300
Welcome to the revolution, man.

909
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:53,097
There is no revolution, stupid!

910
01:16:54,576 --> 01:16:56,339
We are just you and me now.

911
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:59,213
There is nothing special about you.

912
01:16:59,414 --> 01:17:01,780
Like all the other useless
and vagabonds out there ...

913
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:04,374
too busy with his poetry gay
to get a job ...

914
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:05,977
or take a damn shower!

915
01:17:07,856 --> 01:17:08,788
Now ...

916
01:17:09,191 --> 01:17:13,992
you will tell me everything
I need to know, Joe ...

917
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:18,130
because it is so
the world works.

918
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:24,335
Okay.

919
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,940
Want to talk?
Let's talk.

920
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:29,433
Yes, I would love to talk.

921
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:32,405
Who are you?

922
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:40,583
I'm an angel.

923
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:44,419
Sent to Earth
by a just God ...

924
01:17:44,526 --> 01:17:47,984
to punish the weak
with the flaming sword of vengeance.

925
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:50,696
This is your day.

926
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,534
It's your turn to be judged.

927
01:17:54,436 --> 01:17:55,926
Judged by what?

928
01:17:56,104 --> 01:17:57,935
Really want me to say?

929
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:05,845
Great!

930
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:10,181
- I do not know who is speaking.
- You know, yeah, man!

931
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:12,083
Yes, you!

932
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:15,046
I see in your face.

933
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:17,150
You feel it.

934
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:19,760
Every hour of every day
every time.

935
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:25,359
When I see your eyes poisoned
and no soul, I feel your pain, man!

936
01:18:26,101 --> 01:18:27,625
I feel your pain!

937
01:18:28,637 --> 01:18:30,832
- Scroll through my veins.
- Shut up!

938
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:32,031
It is my curse.

939
01:18:32,274 --> 01:18:33,866
It's my curse, man!

940
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:35,776
What are you talking about?

941
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:38,778
"Beware of false prophets
which come to you in sheep's clothing.

942
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,747
For they are ravening wolves "!

943
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:44,452
What?

944
01:18:44,753 --> 01:18:46,914
- Stay out of it, Summer.
- Clark?

945
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:48,717
Stay out.
Take care of it!

946
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:50,121
Yeah, you can handle it.

947
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:53,293
Please take good care,
is not, buddy?

948
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:56,522
I think not.
You do not care about anything.

949
01:18:56,732 --> 01:19:00,133
You are about to discover that there are
some things that can not control.

950
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:02,336
Really? Really?

951
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:06,940
I think it will be very easy
tied with you in that chair!

952
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:09,566
Do not commit more sins, man!

953
01:19:09,678 --> 01:19:12,078
It will only bring more disgrace
for yourself!

954
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:16,077
So I think I will be
a fucking bastard, is not it?

955
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:21,686
Now you tell me everything
I need to know. As I go from here?

956
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:23,280
Clark, no. No!

957
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:25,182
- Clark, no.
- Let me go!

958
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:27,625
- You can not do that!
- Let me go!

959
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:32,532
Here comes the devil.

960
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:36,499
As I go from here?

961
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:39,773
As I go from here?

962
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:42,440
As I go from here?

963
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:45,244
As I go from here?

964
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,705
You have no idea who I am.

965
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:52,545
Pilgrim, have no idea
who I am!

966
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,354
No! No!

967
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:36,090
What did he do to you?

968
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,191
I just want to go home.

969
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:46,970
There must be a way
out of here.

970
01:20:47,108 --> 01:20:48,666
He must have a car
or something.

971
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:50,971
Clark, you cut his finger!

972
01:20:52,447 --> 01:20:54,142
What happened to you?

973
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:57,047
I have to go further, Summer.

974
01:20:57,285 --> 01:20:58,309
No!

975
01:21:05,493 --> 01:21:06,585
Look at me.

976
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:10,289
This is our only chance
out of here.

977
01:21:12,968 --> 01:21:14,094
Okay?

978
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:16,462
Okay.

979
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:31,476
But deliver us from all evil.
Hail Mary, Mother of God, pray for us ...

980
01:21:32,787 --> 01:21:33,913
- Wake up.
- Amen

981
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:35,579
Wake up, asshole.

982
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:45,296
Now there is nothing which does not
you to leave.

983
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:51,095
So if you value your life useless
tell me what I need to know ...

984
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:54,502
and all this can stop.

985
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:56,577
Why would I want to
to stop?

986
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:59,077
All it
has a consequence.

987
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:00,805
That's why we're here.

988
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:02,745
Welcome to your hell!

989
01:22:03,485 --> 01:22:05,214
As well,
is why we are here?

990
01:22:05,654 --> 01:22:07,087
The tire blew!

991
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:09,657
It was pretty ugly, right?

992
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:11,991
You did that?

993
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:15,157
No matter who,
or how, or when.

994
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:17,230
The only thing that matters
is that you are here.

995
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:18,588
Here for what?

996
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:20,732
Do not talk to him, Summer.
Do not listen.

997
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:23,263
Your husband is not what it seems.

998
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:24,837
Do not talk to her.

999
01:22:24,973 --> 01:22:26,736
Do not say a word for it!

1000
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:28,604
He is one of the bad guys!

1001
01:22:29,644 --> 01:22:30,838
Shut up!

1002
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:32,470
Not even Clark?

1003
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:39,279
Listen, you and I are talking,
you tell me how to get out of here.

1004
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:41,480
I have said all I can.

1005
01:22:42,857 --> 01:22:44,757
Only you can ask for forgiveness.

1006
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:47,518
Only you can get
repentance.

1007
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:49,893
But you will not.

1008
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:53,563
With each breath,
you add layer upon layer ...

1009
01:22:53,702 --> 01:22:55,067
sin upon sin.

1010
01:22:55,503 --> 01:22:57,994
I could not tell the truth
even if he tried!

1011
01:23:01,943 --> 01:23:04,343
He told his wife
what he found in the car?

1012
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,338
Shut up!

1013
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:08,549
Damn!

1014
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,178
What does he mean?

1015
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:12,017
Tell her, Clark.

1016
01:23:12,754 --> 01:23:13,846
Do not hold back.

1017
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:16,315
What he is talking about, Clark?

1018
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:17,823
I do not know what he's talking about.

1019
01:23:17,926 --> 01:23:20,554
- Now you have two secrets.
- Clark!

1020
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:21,594
I do not know!

1021
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:22,997
Damn!

1022
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:24,893
I will not hesitate this time.

1023
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:27,628
You can not kill me, man!

1024
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:29,804
You have no idea
than I am able!

1025
01:23:29,904 --> 01:23:32,372
I know exactly what you are capable,
but can not kill me ...

1026
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:33,839
but will not leave.

1027
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:35,235
Where is your car?

1028
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:36,502
Where is your car?

1029
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:39,345
I'm not joking this time!

1030
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:45,820
All right, man ...

1031
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:48,478
you got me.

1032
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:51,990
I'll take it from here ...

1033
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,926
but I take it
a place before.

1034
01:23:56,564 --> 01:23:58,156
That's going to be.

1035
01:23:59,234 --> 01:24:00,394
Take us where?

1036
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:03,562
Take us where?

1037
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:05,263
I show you everything.

1038
01:24:06,107 --> 01:24:07,267
At the River.

1039
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:11,873
All answers are on river.

1040
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:15,781
Then you can kill me.

1041
01:24:17,952 --> 01:24:20,978
If what you want.
If it is what you want.

1042
01:24:39,207 --> 01:24:40,174
I do not know, do not.

1043
01:24:40,275 --> 01:24:42,368
Okay, I'm in control.
Up!

1044
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:44,145
Walk.

1045
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,277
Why took my picture
Benny?

1046
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:49,906
- Do not talk to him, Summer.
- Ask him.

1047
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:53,077
You and I have nothing to say
each other, then keep walking.

1048
01:24:53,221 --> 01:24:56,019
Really.
You do not like to talk, like, Clark?

1049
01:24:56,391 --> 01:24:58,723
- Have you talked to Benny?
- Did what?

1050
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:00,389
Sorry about that.

1051
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,125
What he is talking about, Clark?
What about Ben?

1052
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:06,699
I do not know what he's talking about.
We keep moving, please?

1053
01:25:06,835 --> 01:25:08,097
How do you know my son?

1054
01:25:08,203 --> 01:25:10,137
I know a thing or two
about Ben.

1055
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:14,071
I know he has five years
and currently Ronson, eight.

1056
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:16,770
What did you say?

1057
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:18,775
He is quite fragile, is not it?

1058
01:25:19,347 --> 01:25:22,316
- Especially now, is not Clark?
- Shut your damn mouth!

1059
01:25:25,553 --> 01:25:26,679
How do you know Ben?

1060
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:28,755
I know everything about everyone.

1061
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:31,752
So, when someone gets out of line,
I can be there.

1062
01:25:33,061 --> 01:25:35,723
And I'm watching you
long, boy.

1063
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:37,296
Keep walking.

1064
01:25:37,398 --> 01:25:39,161
What's going on?
As he knows Ben?

1065
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:41,563
I do not know
I must have said something to him before.

1066
01:25:41,703 --> 01:25:43,330
He knows where he studies, Clark.

1067
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:46,535
Summer, it's crazy
okay?

1068
01:25:48,843 --> 01:25:52,574
Listen, you and I have
to be united now, okay?

1069
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:54,313
Let.

1070
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:57,145
It is here, ladies.

1071
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:24,702
What is this?

1072
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:26,838
My God.

1073
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:30,144
You killed all those people?

1074
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:33,916
I have never killed a person
in my life.

1075
01:26:36,224 --> 01:26:38,283
All these souls
did it themselves.

1076
01:26:39,894 --> 01:26:44,092
If it makes you feel better,
all of them deserved it.

1077
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:48,198
Great, has already shown us.
Now, as we get out?

1078
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:50,203
I have not shown anything yet.

1079
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:52,406
It's time to give
a closer look.

1080
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:54,465
I will not do
these games with you.

1081
01:26:54,576 --> 01:26:56,635
Not a game, Tarzan and Jane.

1082
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:01,143
He said he would help him after
show and that's going to be.

1083
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:04,078
Can you hold for me down?

1084
01:27:05,787 --> 01:27:06,776
Of course.

1085
01:27:13,828 --> 01:27:14,760
Thank you, Jane.

1086
01:27:18,866 --> 01:27:23,030
God has made community
To live as brothers

1087
01:27:23,204 --> 01:27:27,106
Arm, all together
We walked without stopping

1088
01:27:27,775 --> 01:27:33,611
Jesus Christ is with us
He is young as we

1089
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:35,909
Shut up, I'm losing
patience here!

1090
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:37,950
Praise the Lord

1091
01:27:38,052 --> 01:27:39,280
Say what is happening.

1092
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:43,220
Glory, glory, hallelujah

1093
01:27:43,358 --> 01:27:48,057
Glory, glory, hallelujah

1094
01:27:48,329 --> 01:27:52,959
Glory, glory, hallelujah

1095
01:27:53,234 --> 01:27:57,671
Praise the Lord

1096
01:27:59,607 --> 01:28:01,165
Dead man walking!

1097
01:28:07,882 --> 01:28:09,372
Dead man walking!

1098
01:28:13,554 --> 01:28:14,680
What is this?

1099
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:20,391
His final resting place.

1100
01:28:22,263 --> 01:28:24,527
The final resting place
sin.

1101
01:28:31,105 --> 01:28:32,732
Clark, where is Ben?

1102
01:28:34,075 --> 01:28:35,474
Tell her, Clark.

1103
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:39,545
- Tell where Benny is.
- Where is Ben?

1104
01:28:41,382 --> 01:28:42,610
Now is the time.

1105
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:45,949
Finally, open your heart.

1106
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:49,322
Open your heart!

1107
01:28:50,124 --> 01:28:51,751
Clark, where is Ben?

1108
01:28:52,827 --> 01:28:54,021
Where is he?

1109
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:56,722
Where is Ben?

1110
01:28:57,532 --> 01:28:58,556
Where is Ben?

1111
01:28:58,666 --> 01:29:00,166
Where is his stepson, son?

1112
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:03,728
Tell me where is Ben! Where is Benny?
Tell me where is Ben!

1113
01:29:04,305 --> 01:29:06,205
Tell me where he is!

1114
01:29:06,774 --> 01:29:08,435
It is time to tell the truth?

1115
01:29:09,877 --> 01:29:12,141
You will tell the truth,
open your heart.

1116
01:29:12,313 --> 01:29:13,644
Clark, please!

1117
01:29:14,282 --> 01:29:16,045
Tell me where he is.

1118
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:18,182
But you will not.

1119
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:22,350
Where is Ben?
Where is Ben?

1120
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:23,889
It was Summer.

1121
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:25,390
- No!
- He's gone.

1122
01:29:31,999 --> 01:29:32,931
No!

1123
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:35,195
No, you're lying!
Lie!

1124
01:29:41,109 --> 01:29:42,599
No!
This is not happening.

1125
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:45,474
This is the destination
the journey of his life, Clark.

1126
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:50,781
This is the consequence
everything you've done.

1127
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:52,577
Clark, please.

1128
01:29:53,121 --> 01:29:55,146
Please,
tell me what is happening.

1129
01:29:56,724 --> 01:29:58,123
You have sinned ...

1130
01:30:00,161 --> 01:30:05,394
and this is the return of the misery that launched
on the other thousands of times.

1131
01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:08,529
What sin?
I never did anything!

1132
01:30:09,036 --> 01:30:10,663
You do not, but he.

1133
01:30:11,272 --> 01:30:12,239
It!

1134
01:30:18,713 --> 01:30:19,873
No. No!

1135
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:24,347
No, no, no!

1136
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:26,308
No!

1137
01:30:28,489 --> 01:30:29,649
God!

1138
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:34,053
"Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

1139
01:30:34,128 --> 01:30:41,466
Blessed art thou among women.
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus.

1140
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:45,597
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners ...

1141
01:30:45,673 --> 01:30:47,607
and at the hour
of our death, Amen. "

1142
01:30:51,612 --> 01:30:54,706
It's okay.
All right, dear.

1143
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:01,183
He suffered for sins
her husband.

1144
01:31:01,756 --> 01:31:04,054
It's not for me
tell what he did.

1145
01:31:04,192 --> 01:31:07,650
Just know that all
What happens here today ...

1146
01:31:08,095 --> 01:31:10,586
has the approval of God
and only Him.

1147
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:24,375
Should you trust in God, sister.

1148
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:26,971
Believe in the Almighty.

1149
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:29,982
Believe.

1150
01:31:33,921 --> 01:31:35,320
Give me the gun, Summer.

1151
01:31:36,791 --> 01:31:37,723
No.

1152
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:39,251
Give me the gun.

1153
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:41,522
Who are you?

1154
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:45,690
What?

1155
01:31:46,701 --> 01:31:48,965
Summer, it's me, baby.
What are you doing?

1156
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:50,669
Who are you?

1157
01:31:56,210 --> 01:31:57,541
What did you do?

1158
01:31:59,447 --> 01:32:01,813
I did not do anything, Summer.
I do not know who is speaking.

1159
01:32:02,984 --> 01:32:04,542
What did you do?

1160
01:32:05,786 --> 01:32:07,617
Honey, what are you doing?

1161
01:32:08,089 --> 01:32:11,456
He says it's his fault.
So what did you do?

1162
01:32:12,793 --> 01:32:14,260
Summer, did nothing.

1163
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:17,888
I know, Clark.

1164
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:20,265
I did nothing.

1165
01:32:20,434 --> 01:32:21,696
What did you do?

1166
01:32:24,438 --> 01:32:25,769
You do not know me.

1167
01:32:30,645 --> 01:32:32,840
My son is dead, Clark!

1168
01:32:33,581 --> 01:32:34,809
What did you do?

1169
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:39,285
Whatever I say!

1170
01:32:46,594 --> 01:32:48,687
I just want to know what you did.

1171
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:00,372
Please.

1172
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:04,176
I can not tell you.

1173
01:33:08,783 --> 01:33:10,045
I can not, Summer.

1174
01:33:12,286 --> 01:33:13,913
Just tell me what you did.

1175
01:33:16,824 --> 01:33:17,882
Tell the truth, Clark.

1176
01:33:20,161 --> 01:33:22,152
"For the truth shall make you free."

1177
01:33:23,931 --> 01:33:25,694
I just want to know.

1178
01:33:30,771 --> 01:33:32,261
I know the truth hurts, baby.

1179
01:33:33,874 --> 01:33:35,205
But the lies ...

1180
01:33:37,511 --> 01:33:38,944
lies kill.

1181
01:33:40,848 --> 01:33:42,577
Just tell me what you did.

1182
01:33:51,058 --> 01:33:51,990
I. ..

1183
01:33:52,326 --> 01:33:53,384
I can not.

1184
01:33:54,028 --> 01:33:55,086
Tell me.

1185
01:33:56,163 --> 01:33:58,028
Tell me! Tell me!

1186
01:33:58,099 --> 01:33:59,726
Say what you did!

1187
01:34:01,202 --> 01:34:02,829
I can not tell you, Summer.

1188
01:34:05,606 --> 01:34:07,267
Point and squeeze.

1189
01:34:15,282 --> 01:34:16,408
I'm sorry.

1190
01:34:17,385 --> 01:34:18,613
I can not tell.

1191
01:34:31,032 --> 01:34:32,124
I'm sorry.

1192
01:34:41,475 --> 01:34:42,407
No!

1193
01:34:49,250 --> 01:34:50,217
No!

1194
01:34:53,788 --> 01:34:54,914
No!

1195
01:34:58,559 --> 01:35:01,392
"Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

1196
01:35:01,462 --> 01:35:03,123
Come to Thy kingdom.

1197
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:04,824
Be done Thy will,
on earth as in heaven

1198
01:35:10,004 --> 01:35:12,165
Bread our daily
Give us today.

1199
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:15,936
Forgive us our trespasses as
we forgive those who trespass against us.

1200
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:20,413
Lead us not into temptation.
But deliver us from evil.

1201
01:35:24,452 --> 01:35:26,784
Lead us not into temptation.

1202
01:35:43,604 --> 01:35:44,536
Amen

1203
01:35:45,806 --> 01:35:47,706
Amen Amen "

1204
01:36:06,627 --> 01:36:08,026
What did he do?

1205
01:36:10,231 --> 01:36:13,758
It's not for me to say.
I can only say it was bad.

1206
01:36:17,138 --> 01:36:18,400
And why me?

1207
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:21,332
Why am I being punished?

1208
01:36:21,909 --> 01:36:23,706
Your sin is apathy.

1209
01:36:25,846 --> 01:36:28,906
Somewhere deep in your soul,
you know what it was ...

1210
01:36:29,850 --> 01:36:31,442
and yet did nothing.

1211
01:36:36,490 --> 01:36:38,390
And so you betrayed us all.

1212
01:37:01,982 --> 01:37:04,212
I wish it could come with me.

1213
01:37:20,434 --> 01:37:21,765
Who are you?

1214
01:37:23,938 --> 01:37:25,565
I am the future of the world!

1215
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:30,841
But the world
not know it yet.

1216
01:37:36,016 --> 01:37:36,983
No!

1217
01:37:40,421 --> 01:37:41,388
No.

1218
01:39:56,790 --> 01:39:59,190
In every life there is a choice.

1219
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:01,289
A fork in the road.

1220
01:40:02,129 --> 01:40:04,927
There is the path of righteousness
and the path of sin.

1221
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:09,167
You can walk the path of sin
for many days.

1222
01:40:09,903 --> 01:40:11,734
You can even start to like it.

1223
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:15,104
Until one day you see me,
coming your way.

1224
01:40:16,977 --> 01:40:20,242
And when you do,
you better come back and run.

1225
01:40:21,148 --> 01:40:23,378
Back to the bifurcation
and take the other road.

1226
01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:24,915
Where are you going, dear?

1227
01:40:25,085 --> 01:40:27,019
Where you are, dear.

1228
01:40:27,354 --> 01:40:29,788
Because if we cross paths
is too late.

1229
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:42,191
And I'll burn it.

1230
01:40:44,004 --> 01:40:45,995
- Thank you.
- Nothing.

1231
01:43:07,481 --> 01:43:09,745
