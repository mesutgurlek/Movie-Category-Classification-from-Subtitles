NARRATOR:
A thousand miles from El Paso
to the border of Louisiana,

2
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:36,118
1, 000 miles from the gulf
along the winding, colorful
waters of the Rio Grande,

3
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,790
from Mexico to the Panhandle,

4
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,862
Texas,

5
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,764
Across this vast empire
moved first
the shaggy buffalo

6
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,101
and then cattle
in great herds,

7
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,834
raiding red men
and marauding white men,

8
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:51,806
and later, as the 19th century
was nearing its end,

9
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:55,006
the settlers who had
established themselves
in this frontier wilderness

10
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,811
were beset by desperadoes
and outlaws,

11
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,250
and it was in order
to make life safe,

12
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,550
to ensure prosperity
and progress,

13
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,216
that, early in the American
occupation of Texas,

14
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:09,387
an organization known
as the Texas Rangers
was formed,

15
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:13,293
Throughout their history,
the Rangers have been men
of exceptional character,

16
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,993
unyielding courage,
rare physical endurance,

17
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,468
Hard riding, fast shooting,

18
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,107
Their service
was to a state they loved,

19
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:26,735
For an ideal, they were
willing to give up
their lives, and gladly,

20
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:31,009

We ought to know.

153
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,109
Who's "we"?

154
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,308
Rangers.

155
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,477
Rangers? What's them?

156
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:17,783
You ain't been in Texas Iong
if you ain't heard
of the Texas Rangers.

157
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,793
Oh, somebody's
fooling you, neighbor.

158
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,886
Ain't nobody gonna hold up
this coach today.

159
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,157
They'd be crazy
if they did.

160
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,529
Come on,
get up there, Gabe.

161
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,627
Comes real trouble,
I shoot first
and ask questions afterwards.

162
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:32,964
You mean that?

163
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,904
You ain't got nothing
to worry about.

164
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,465
You just keep a hold
of them Iines.

165
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,774
Still and all, ain't no use
shooting to kill
if you can help it, is there?

166
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,905
We'II see.

167
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,978
Whoa!

168
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,429
AII right, folks.
You can get out and stretch
your Iegs if you want to.

169
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,966
Thank you.

170
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,415
Hello, stranger.

171
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,715
AIways got room
for one more passenger.

172
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,255
What's the matter with you?
You daffy?

173
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,121
Get up on that seat
and be ready to throw down
that express box.

174
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:03,059
Who, me?
No, sir, the only time
I was ever Iate

175
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,723
was when one of my mules
threw a shoe.

176
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,165
Don't start nothing now.
Get in that stagecoach
and sit tight.

177
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,431
I'II explain to you Iater.

178
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,807
You'II explain nothing.
Get up on that seat.

179
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,266
That man up there,
riding with me...

180
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:22,178
Hey, driver, you've watered
those mules Iong enough.
Let's get moving.

181
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,274
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Right away. Yes, sir.

182
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:29,082
I'II have you
in Junction City in
no time at all, my friend.

183
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,921
Come right in here.
AII aboard, folks.

184
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,154
Wait a minute. I ain't riding
in this shoe box.

185
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:39,664
$3.60, right to the penny.

186
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,560
Get in. Get in.

187
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,518
Come on, boys.
Get going.

188
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,579
What a day!
What a day, neighbor,

189
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:08,115
just to be alive.
I feel so good
I think I'II sing a song.

190
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,320
Would you Iike
to hear me sing?

191
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,885
I don't care for music.

192
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:14,797
It's your Ioss, my friend.
I think I'II sing anyway.

193
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:19,064
(SINGING OH SUSANNA)

194
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,799
Come on there, Jasper!

195
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,739
Bang!

196
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,837
Leave the gentleman's gun be!

197
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,973
Mustn't touch things
Iike that.

198
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,540
MAN: Put up your hands!

199
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,642
(GUN FIRING)

200
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:58,506
That's what I was trying
to tell you. Texas Rangers.

201
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:00,477
Texas Rangers, huh?

202
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,278
If that's
the way they work,
I'm gonna stay clear of 'em.

203
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,146
They got
no sense of humor.

204
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,018
I motion we adjourn
to the nearest saloon

205
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,180
and talk over
this episode at Iength.

206
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,281
I second the motion.

207
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,802
JIM AND WAHOO:
Therefore, as a member
of the Ranger Force of Texas,

208
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,804
I do solemnly swear...

209
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:30,069
To make the peace
and preserve Iaw and order.

210
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,804
BOTH: To make the peace
and preserve Iaw and order.

211
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,709
To the best
of my ability.

212
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,839
BOTH:
To the best of my ability.

213
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,350
AII this to the end

214
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:43,320
that the State of Texas
may be a safe place
in which to Iive.

215
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,721
BOTH: AII this to the end
that the State of Texas

216
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,453
may be a safe place
in which to Iive.

217
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,690
So help me God.

218
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,523
Well?

219
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,191
BOTH: So help me God.

220
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,569
Sign right here.

221
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:11,105
We don't ask
too many questions
when a man joins the Rangers.

222
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:15,449
Courage, a good head
and a better aim,

223
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,749
that's about all
that's required.

224
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,752
Those men died
with their boots on,

225
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,721
not for the small wage
they receive,

226
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,529
but for an ideal,

227
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:34,162
the determination to make
this state a civilized place
in which to Iive,

228
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,706
and so, Hawkins, Jones,

229
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:40,768
you enter into a service
which holds a fine heritage.

230
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,645
If you're worth
two hoops in Hades,
it'II bring it out of you.

231
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:49,083
If you're not,
it'II bring that out, too.

232
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,154
Fair enough.

233
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:57,753
Oh, here's
some regulations you boys
better be Iooking over.

234
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,060
That's all, boys.

235
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,532
Hiya, Ranger.

236
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,579
He doesn't know it yet,
but he's got a couple
of star boarders

237
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,582
for the rest of his Iife,
the old buzzard.

238
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:23,114
Look, hard head, there's
a Iot more to this job than
40 bucks a month and chuck,

239
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,348
a Iot more.

240
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,391
You tell me.
I'm all ears.

241
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,518
I can't tell you just yet.
I gotta figure it out first,

242
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,426
but Iisten,

243
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,958
there ain't a game
in this world
that wasn't made to be beat

244
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,831
if you're dealing the cards.

245
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:40,235
AII right, my proud beauty,
when you get around to it,
deal me in, will you?

246
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,536
Meantime, I'II take
these rules and regulations

247
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,473
and put 'em
next to my heart.

248
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:47,205
Don't Iet it
worry you, son.

249
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:56,686
"Rangers are instructed
to return all stolen cattle
to their rightful owner.

250
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,821
"When a Ranger
is assigned to protect
a shipment of gold..."

251
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:10,758
And hen I meet a stagecoach
How happy I would feel

252
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,929
How happy I would feel

253
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,405
How happy I would feel

254
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,035
Hey, boy, put a Iittle
sow butter in them beans.
I'm kind of hungry today.

255
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,541
"To make Texas a safe place
to Iive in."

256
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,413
What's the matter, Ranger?
What are you so happy about?

257
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,851
Hey, Walrus,
did you ever see this one?

258
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,489
Fake Iow, catch you
with the backhand.
Never misses.

259
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:37,355
Oh, boy! A hammock!

260
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,428
Say, I think
I'II take me a nap.

261
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,023
Call me
when dinner's ready, friend.

262
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,799
In my time,
you had to be a man
to join the Rangers.

263
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,733
Hey, anybody home?
Just want to use the hammock.

264
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,802
Rules and regulations.

265
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,648
I never had no pocket change

266
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,512
I thought that hardly fair

267
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:06,750
Way up on the highway
I met a stagecoach there

268
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,019
Peeking!

269
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,589
Hey, you new men,

270
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,200
get your horses.
We're going out.

271
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,395
Who? Me?

272
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,768
Yes, both of you.

273
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,076
Where you going?
We ain't ate yet.

274
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,772
Never mind that.
Mount your horses.

275
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,214
I ain't been here
for five minutes,

276
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,310
and he wants
to go out riding.

277
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,851
We've been riding for days.

278
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,851
Oh, the big mallet head!

279
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,520
Wants to become a Ranger!

280
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,064
You certainly get
some great ideas.
Texas Rangers.

281
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,699
You're still a Iittle punchy
from bouncing around
on those stagecoaches.

282
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,472
Oh, yeah?

283
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,869
Hold it!

284
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,873
The Major figures
that the rustlers
will try to cross the river

285
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,069
between Del Rio on the north
and Eagle Pass on the south.

286
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,338
Johnson.
Yes, boss.

287
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,935
McBride.
Coming.

288
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,277
You'II take the north cut
to Del Rio.

289
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,509
Introduce yourselves
to Marshal Bill Gree.

290
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:45,282
Adams, we suspect
the Hamblin
Iand-and-cattle company.

291
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,453
Pick up all
the information possible.
Right, captain.

292
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:49,516
Peters.
Yes, sir.

293
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,619
Lee.
Yeah.

294
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:51,685
Ditson.
Yeah.

295
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:54,254
Stake the country
between Comado
and Pinto Creek.

296
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,130
We will, boss.
Yes, sir.

297
00:18:56,602 --> 00:19:00,504
Hawkins and Jones,
you'II patrol the river
from Comado South,

298
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,199
a distance of 20 miles.

299
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,071
Yes, sir.

300
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,639
Rodriguez. Come with me.

301
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,340
Bien, Capitán,

302
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,729
Throw up your hat.
I want to get in
a couple of wing shots.

303
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:28,732
Throw up your own hat.
I'm not gonna get
sunstroke for you.

304
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,566
I don't know why they sent

and combing his hair
and washing his face and
seeing he gets an education

479
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:37,334
is gonna make a sissy

00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:03,916
They got Hank.

610
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,161
Pobre amigo,

611
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,530
Sure is funny
what Iengths
some fellows will go

612
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,370
to keep from
paying their debts,
ain't it?

613
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,901
Yeah.

(GRUNTING)

615
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:42,558
Did you say something
about being safe?

616
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,931
Nobody but an Indian
could think that up.

617
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,589
Nice, eh?
They pay you off
with peanuts.

618
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,853
If I ever
get out of here alive,
I'm finished.

619
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:09,859
Quit bellyaching.
You've seen everything.

620
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:11,895
I ain't done everything.

Rodriguez!

622
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,497
I go to get them, amigos,
Adiós!

624

Madre mia,,, Adiós,

625
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,929
There never was a finer man.

626
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,536
Look, we might be
smashed to pieces.

627

Every man stay where he is.

628
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:03,240
Let me go
after them, Major.

629
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,475
You're married, Frank.
You got children.
Let me go!

630
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:08,814
What are you talking about?
You got a wife
in Dallas, ain't you?

631
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:10,877
Well, I got no offspring
following me around.

632
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:14,424
Yeah, you don't see
no blond squaw
sitting on my Iap, neither.

633
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,723
Look out!

634
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,003
Did it get you?
My Ieg.

635
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,177
Stay here.
I'II be back.

636
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,612
Where do you think
I'm going? To a dance?

I wonder
what happened to Jim.

643

Maybe I ought
to say a prayer,
if I knowed one.

Now that we've placed
the Indians on the reservation
for good,

653
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:20,726
the people can Iook
to real progress,

a state marching forward
to its rightful destiny,

655
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:28,635
but there's
one stumbling block,
trouble from our own citizens.

656
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:30,907
As soon as
a community becomes rich,

657
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:33,738
a town important,
corruption springs up,

658
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:37,677
thieving cattle barons,
organized gangs
of cutthroats,

659
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:40,874
crooked judges, sheriffs,
district attorneys.

660
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:44,610
Take this section here.
Kimball, Mason, Sutton.

661
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:47,187
They should be
the most prosperous
in the state,

662
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,248
instead of which
they're the most corrupt.

663
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:52,489
Of them all,
Kimball is the most
flagrant example.

664
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:56,525
What's more,
it's ruled by one man
who grafts on everybody.

665
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,497
He could commit murder
and get away with it.

666
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:03,369
CIean up Kimball,
and you throw fear
into every other county.

667
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,609
Major, I'd Iike the honor
of tackling that job.

668
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:10,338
I'd already made up my mind
to give it to you and Gillis.

669
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:13,807
If you don't mind,
I'd Iike to handle it myself.

670
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:17,781
I got some ideas of my own.
That is, if it's all right
with you, Jake.

671
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:20,789
You're biting off
a pretty big chaw,
but I reckon...

672
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:22,347
Thanks, Jake.

673
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:24,318
Well, Major, what about it?

674
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:26,021
Seems to be all settled,

675
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:29,588
but no gunplay unless
it's absolutely necessary.

676
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,302
Here are some
Kimball County reports
you can Iook over.

677
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,564
Thanks.

678
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:39,834
Weren't you afraid for him
when he started up
the canyon wall?

679
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,504
No, he was in
the softest spot of all.

680
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:43,943
I had him covered
all the time.

681
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:46,847
He didn't have a thing
to be worried about.

682
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,680
Between me and you,
I was the real hero.

683
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:53,849
Why didn't you go
all the way with Jim?

684
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:57,852
I wanted to,
but that dang foot
stopped me.

685
00:49:57,928 --> 00:50:00,123
It would have
stopped anybody.

686
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:05,793
If it wasn't for Jim,
you and the Major
wouldn't be here, would you?

687
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:10,133
The way you talk, you'd think
Jim whipped that bunch
of Indians by himself.

688
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:12,903
I was in there.
I never shot so fast
in my Iife.

689
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:15,342
Indians was dropping around me
Iike rotten apples.

690
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:22,047
There ain't many Rangers
Iike Jim,
are there, Wahoo?

691
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:26,545
No, I guess...
Say, ain't you got
some arithmetic to do?

Hello, Jim.
We was just talking
about you.

695
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:40,064
That's all he ever
talk about. I thought
you was coming early.

696
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:43,368
Say, Davey,
do me a favor, will you?
Sure thing.

697
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,635
Turn Baldy Ioose
in the pasture and see
he gets plenty of grass.

698
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,937
You bet.

00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:52,675
I'm expecting Sam.

701
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,279
When?
About sundown.

702
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:58,646
What for?
What do you think?
To talk a Iittle business.

703
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,917
Yeah?
Yeah, that Indian fight
did the trick.

704
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,653
We're aces
with the Major now,
and I picked a sweet job.

705
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,627
I'm off single-handed on
one of the biggest assignments

706
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:08,220
the Rangers have had
in a Iong time.

707
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:13,033
Say, what's eating you?

708
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:15,634
Come on, out with it.

709
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,801
Listen, Jim, you know
I ain't getting mushy.

710
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:23,004
You know me
better than that.

711
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:26,315
But we haven't had things
so bad here.

712
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:28,777
They Iike us.

713
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:31,720
We're among right people,

for the first time.

715

We've had a good time
together here,
haven't we, Jim?

716
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:39,293
We've always had a good time
no matter where we've been.

That's not what I mean.

718
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:45,599
I'm thinking of Rodriguez
when he climbed that cliff,

knowing that
he's gonna get killed.

720

Wasn't that one
of the finest things
you ever saw in your Iife?

721
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:54,370
Yeah, I guess
he had what it takes,
all right.

722
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:57,345
Poor old Hank, begging me
for a chaw of tobacco.

723

I'II bet he's up in heaven
right now, spitting down
on them Indians.

What are you trying to do?
Break me down?

You make me sick.
You turn my stomach
with that cheap sentiment.

What's being a Ranger
ever gonna get you?

730
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:21,361
If you're not shot
by the time you're 50,
you end up without a nickel.

731

I want all I can get
while I can enjoy it.
Me and Sam's gonna get it.

732

from now on,
and I'm dealing you out.

737
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:38,619
I didn't know you were here.

738

I was just Ieaving.
Just Ieaving?

739
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,287
Seems you're always
just Ieaving.

740
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:43,986
What are you afraid of?
The measles?

741
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,995
I had them
when I was a child.
I had them, too.

742
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:50,029
Well, I guess
I'd better be going.

743
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,226
Must you?

744
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:53,098
Yeah, I got to. Goodbye.

745
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:54,999
Goodbye.

746
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,843
Nice fellow, that Jim.

747
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,915
Why doesn't he Iike me?

748
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:09,911
Don't fool yourself.
He does.

749
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:12,949
Got a funny way
of showing it.

750
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:15,788
You know what we was
just talking about?

751
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,224
Uh-uh.

752
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:18,420
We was talking about you.

753
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:19,587
No.

754
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,322
When we was Iooking
for Injuns,

755
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:23,889
he did nothing but
talk about you all the time.

756
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:25,764
Wahoo, you're joking.

757
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:28,764
Tell me what he said
about me.

758
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:33,606
Oh, he talked about your hair.

759
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:34,871
My hair?

760
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:37,243

Oh, you sure
could have fooled me.

764
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:48,918
Well, he's a very shy fellow.

765
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:51,722
He'd probably Iive to be
100 years old and not even
mention it to you.

766
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:53,023
Really?

767
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:56,398
Oh, another thing
he told me.
What?

768
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:00,225
That if he ever settled down,
it would be
with a girl just Iike you.

I think you are.

It's mighty sweet of you
telling me all that, Wahoo.

helping out a friend,

Kimball County's

He collects tribute
from every saloon

He's got men rustling horses
and cattle.

788

Sounds Iike
a good businessman.

789
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:03,799
He's got
a hand in everything,

He's had the good citizens
buffaloed for a Iong time,

794

but some of 'em finally
screwed up enough nerve
to ask the Rangers for help.

instead of going around
telling other people.

talking about?

the color of 'em.

I'd say they were

you face the truth,

What truth?

839
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:53,497
That we Iove each other.

840

It's not.

the way it happened.

843
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:02,902
It's all the more beautiful
because we didn't go after it.

Jim, it just happened.

don't you believe in Iove?

I do, and I mean

Yeah.

01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,853
Well, what's the matter
with this place?

918
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:36,357
This ought to make
a good courthouse.

will be right there,
in back of the bar.

We'II twist
the roulette table around,
the jury can sit there.

921
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:45,267
The prosecution can sit
at the stud table there,
the defense back there.

922
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:47,063

923

for my arrest.

No, the more, the merrier.

928
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:10,418
You know, I never been
in court before.

929
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:12,321
Ought to be
kind of interesting.

930
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,521
Yeah, it ought to.

931

on that.

No, I gotta go dig up
one first-class witness.

934
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:29,770
Casper Johnson,
now, it has come
to my attention

935
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:31,643
that you publicly stated

936
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:35,582
that you saw Higgins
enter into the Iivery stable
on the afternoon in question.

937
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:36,879
Now, is that so?

938
01:02:36,953 --> 01:02:39,649
Dave, that ain't fair
to put me on the spot
Iike this.

940
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:43,448
I insist you make the witness
stop beating around the bush.

941
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:46,427
Oh, he's a bit confused,
but he's doing
the best he can.

942
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:48,191
Yes or no, Casper?

943
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,357
Well, I was up in the Ioft,

944
01:02:50,466 --> 01:02:52,525
but you can't see good
from there,

945
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,935
and I had a fork full
of hay at the time.

946
01:02:56,005 --> 01:03:00,567
Never mind that. Did you
or did you not see Higgins
go into the Iivery stable?

947
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:05,907
Well, it's nearly a year ago.
I've... My memory
ain't so good anymore.

Now, Iook here, Casper,
murder is
a pretty serious business.

953
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:17,685
Unless you can state
positively

954
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,491
that Higgins is the man
that entered the Iivery stable
and shot the Hartford boys,

955
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:23,498
you'd better get down
off that stand.

956
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:25,431
That's a good idea, Judge.

957
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:28,493
I shouldn't have come here
in the first place.

958
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:32,699
Far be it from me
to convict an innocent man,

959
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:36,375
so, if you don't mind,
I'II just toddle along.

Just a minute, Judge.

961
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:41,073
I wanna ask the witness
a couple of questions.

962
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,981
TWITCHELL:
This is most irregular.
You can't do that!

Who says I can't?
Get up there.

964
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:49,751
Casper, I'm advising you
to tell the truth

965
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,555
'cause if you don't,
your address is gonna be

966
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:53,891
the state prison
in Huntsville.

967
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:56,590
Now answer direct,
yes or no.

968
01:03:56,933 --> 01:04:00,198
You saw the defendant,
Jess Higgins shoot and kill
Dick Hartford, didn't you?

969
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:02,328
Well...
Come on!
You did, didn't you?

970
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:04,373
I merely thought that...
Yes!

971
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,671
Yes.
Say, who's running
this court?

972
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:09,870
I am, from now on.
Sit down.

973
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,547
Then Fred Hartford
came in the stable,

974
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:14,776
and Higgins shot
and killed him, didn't he?

975
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,978
Well, in a way...
Didn't he?

976
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:18,281
Yes!
Yes.

977
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,380
That's all, Casper.
Thanks.

978
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:23,216
Whew!

979
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:25,389
The court has heard
all the witnesses
it needs to hear.

980
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:27,326
Right.
Sum up, Mr. Twitchell.

981
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:31,597
Gentlemen, it's up to you
to bring in a verdict.

982
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:33,692
A just verdict!
Conviction!

983
01:04:33,836 --> 01:04:37,203
Now, if Mr. Higgins is guilty,
he should be punished,

984
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:40,742
but no one but Casper Johnson
saw the shootings.

985
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:44,975
Now, we have here
the rather incoherent story

986
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:48,016
of a man who affirms,
then denies,

987
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:50,382
then affirms
that he saw the killings.

988
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:53,478
It seems to me
he shouldn't be
a witness at all!

989
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:57,515
Therefore, we don't want
to hang or send to jail
an innocent man,

990
01:04:57,627 --> 01:05:00,187

the evidence

for the first time.

1067
01:08:57,266 --> 01:09:00,201
We, as citizens, have
kind of made a Iittle pool

1068
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:02,567
and bought
the Hartford brothers' ranch

1069
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:05,368
to give to you
as a token of appreciation.

Well, gentlemen,
that's mighty nice
of all of you.

1072
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:12,337
If I ever do settle down,

1073
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:14,279
I wouldn't want
a better place
than Kimball County.

1074
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:15,339
That's right!

1075
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:17,647
The town needs
such men as you.

1076
01:09:18,053 --> 01:09:19,111
Yes, sir.

1077
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:20,348
Well, boys, I guess
the drinks are on me.

(ALL CHEERING)

1079
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:26,756
Well, Jim, Iet's drink
to our own finish.

1080
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:28,986
May we never meet again.

1081
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:30,554
Oh, I'II keep out
of your way, Jim.

1082
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:32,498
Success.
And good Iuck.

who is trying to take the law
into his own hands,

1096
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:17,070
This man
is a dangerous character,

1097
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:19,470
Don't take any chances
with him,

1098
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,777
Jim, when did you first
convince yourself

1099
01:11:32,855 --> 01:11:35,449
that I was the only girl
in the world?

1100
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:36,718
The day you made me kiss you.

1101
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:37,952
Made you?

1102
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:41,656
I had to fight
to get away from you.
I was scared to death.

1103
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:43,224
Yeah, I bet.

1104
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,994
Well, I was a Iittle scared.

1105
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:48,629
Jim, what are we
going to do about it?

1106
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:50,898
I haven't figured it out yet.

1107
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,673
Do you think
I'II make a pretty bride?

1108
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:57,539
Well, I haven't
asked you yet.

1109
01:11:57,613 --> 01:12:03,051
Yes, but if you did ask me,
and I did answer yes,
and we did get married,

1110
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:05,709
now, mind you,
I'm just supposing,

1111
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:08,085
where would we Iive?

1112
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:11,488
Well, we couldn't
Iive much any place
on $40 a month,

1113
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:13,158
but I got my eye
on a ranch that...

1114
01:12:13,228 --> 01:12:14,695
Oh, Mr. Hawkins!

1115
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:16,788
That's just
what I was thinking.

1116
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:18,492
Where?
Have you got one?

1117
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:20,592
Yeah, it's in Kimball County.

1118
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:23,502
That's the best grazing Iand
in the state.

1119
01:12:24,406 --> 01:12:25,566
Here.

1120
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:28,839
It's 18 miles north of...
Somewhere.

1121
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:33,304
And it runs five miles
down here along
this wrinkle here and...

1122
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:35,746
Well, anyway,
it's a Iot of Iand.

1123
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:36,978
Oh.

1124
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:40,214
But aren't you afraid
of apron strings?

1125
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:44,783
I used to be afraid
of the bogeyman
when I was a kid.

1126
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:47,423
You're not afraid anymore?

1127
01:12:47,496 --> 01:12:49,327
Uh-uh. Look.

1128
01:12:56,438 --> 01:12:57,496
See?

Goodbye.

1132
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:09,273
Will I see you tonight?

1133
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:12,912
You will
unless they break my arms,
my Iegs and my neck.

Yeah.

1136
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:42,080
He's getting
pretty big.
Yup.

1137
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:45,112
I don't Iike it.
Me, neither.

1139

Hawkins, Major Bailey.

1140
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,509
What's it now, Major?
Another Kimball County?

1141
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:16,073
No, that job of yours
did the trick.
This is something else,

1142
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:17,675
a real manhunt.

1143
01:14:18,086 --> 01:14:22,045
I Ieave the whole thing
up to you. Handle it
any way you see fit.

1144
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:23,582
Sounds big.

1145
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:24,717
It is big.

1146
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:29,188
The man's the one whom all
the newspapers in the state
are calling Polka-Dot.

1147
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:30,925
We're out to get him.

1148
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:33,524
One sensational crime
after another.

1149
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:36,536
He's making Iaughingstocks
out of all of us.

1150
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:39,797
You're to bring him in
dead or alive.

1151
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:44,737
I didn't reckon
on anything Iike this.

1152
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:47,839
You'd better explain that.

1153
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:49,681
I'd rather not
take the job, Major.

1154
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:50,809
Why not?

1155
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:54,422
Well, I...
I been working
pretty hard.

1156
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:55,616
So has this outlaw.

1157
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:58,182
I know, but I'd been hoping
for a vacation.

1158
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:02,720
Never mind that now.
We'II talk about that
after you clean up this job.

1159
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:06,060
You'II start in the morning.
That's an order.

1160
01:15:06,134 --> 01:15:08,534
Take four men.
Pick them yourself.

1161
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:12,398
I'II have to resign, Major.

1162
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:16,801
I'm sorry to hear you
say that, Hawkins.

1163
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:19,507
You've been getting along
pretty well Iately.

1164
01:15:19,581 --> 01:15:22,311
You're about first
in Iine for promotion.

1165
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:29,116
Here's the resignation form.

1166
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:31,120
Sign it.

1167
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,128
Ditson.

1168
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:42,970
Hawkins, you're under arrest.

1169
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:45,132
What for?

1170
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:48,267
The Polka-Dot Bandit
and Sam McGee
are one and the same.

1171
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:50,777
Not so Iong ago,
you were outlaws together.

1172
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:53,178
You were
and you still are pals.

1173
01:15:55,517 --> 01:15:58,350
You're not hiding anything
from me, Hawkins.

1174
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:09,054
How Iong
have you known this?

1175
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:11,861
It came while you were
in Kimball County.

1176
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:15,194
I don't mind telling you
it was hard for me
to believe it.

1177
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:19,502
This was to have been
your real test,
bringing in Sam McGee.

1178
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:22,968
I hoped
you'd come through.

1179
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:31,749
I'm sorry, sir.

1180
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,014
So am I.

1181
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:34,350
Let's go.

1182
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:49,459
Hello, Davey.
I said, hello.

1183
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:52,099
Oh, Iook what
I got for you.

1184
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:55,165
Some Iicorice.

1185
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:03,750
Say, I oiled up my gun.

1186
01:17:04,553 --> 01:17:06,145
Sure works good.

1187
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:08,816
You wanna try it?

1188
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:12,023
What's the matter with you?

1189
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:13,186
Nothing.

1190
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,764
Oh. Thinking
about Jim, huh?

1191
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:22,970
Supposing I am?

1192
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:25,165
Say, Jim ain't a-scared
of that Polka-Dot.

1193
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:28,505
None of the Rangers
around here are.
I know I ain't.

1194
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:30,304
I was wondering.

1195
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:31,471
Well, I ain't.

1196
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:36,748
Seems if you was
a good Ranger, the Major
would've given you the job.

1197
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:40,044
Sent three or four
other fellows,
but he didn't send you.

1198
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:41,180
Is that so?

1199
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:43,952
Well, it ain't gonna do
him no good, 'cause
he ain't gonna find him.

1200
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:48,087
It's gonna take brains
to ferret out that Polka-Dot.
Yes, sir, brains.

1201
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:49,755
I'II bet you
I could find him.

1202
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:51,594
I'm from Missouri, Wahoo.

1203
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:58,897
Say, Davey,
supposing I went out
and got the Polka-Dot

1204
01:17:58,974 --> 01:18:00,669
and brought him in here,

1205
01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:02,232
would you be
proud of me?

1206
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:03,777
You know I would.

1207
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:06,170
Everybody'd be proud of you.

1208
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:09,115
Why, you'd be
the biggest Ranger
of 'em all,

1209
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:11,542
even bigger than Jim was.

1210
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:13,578
That settles it.

1211
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:14,713
Honest?

1212
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:15,814
Honest Injun.

1213
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:17,984
You're gonna take me along
with you, ain't you?

1214
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,049
Don't be daffy.

1215
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:20,958
It's bad enough
me going without
the Major's orders.

1216
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:23,395
They find out I'm missing,
things'II be popping.

1217
01:18:23,465 --> 01:18:25,296
They won't miss me, either,

You'II slow me down.
Besides, Polka-Dot
is a pretty tough hombre,

1220
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:31,595
I gotta figure out a way
to bring him in.

this is a man's job.

I'm a man.
You said, "Man to man."

in a tight spot,
I could go for help.

I ain't gonna get

to send it with

was doing with me.

1254

you saved me

01:28:18,893 --> 01:28:21,259
Strike south
through Concho County.

1372
01:28:21,329 --> 01:28:22,796
Major Bailey!

1373
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:29,929
What is it, Hawkins?

1374
01:28:30,004 --> 01:28:31,130
You've got
to release me, Major.

1375
01:28:31,205 --> 01:28:33,571
Release me
until I can get McGee.

1376
01:28:33,941 --> 01:28:35,135
You've got to, Major!

1377
01:28:35,209 --> 01:28:37,575
How do I know
you don't mean
to join McGee?

1378
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:39,374
I give you my word!

1379
01:28:40,481 --> 01:28:41,709
AII right.

1380
01:28:41,783 --> 01:28:43,614
Bob, open it up.

1381
01:28:50,925 --> 01:28:53,223
Yours?
Yes, and it
won't fail you.

1382
01:28:58,232 --> 01:28:59,961
Bring my horse now!

1383
01:29:26,627 --> 01:29:29,221
(HUMMING)

1384
01:29:35,603 --> 01:29:37,264
(DOOR SQUEAKING)

1385
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:44,675
Jim! Hello.

1386
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,109
I'm so happy to see you.

1387
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:48,909
Is Sam here?

1388
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:51,185
Oh, Sammy? You know him.

1389
01:29:51,619 --> 01:29:54,679
He will not be back
for maybe a month, I think.

1390
01:30:04,198 --> 01:30:05,563
Where's Davey?

1391
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:08,158
Davey?
I don't know, Jim.

1392
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:10,033
He go away yesterday.

1393
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:13,705
Oh, he did.

1394
01:30:25,052 --> 01:30:26,212
Davey.

1395
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:27,579
Jim!

1396
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:30,883
Open the door.

1397
01:30:30,958 --> 01:30:32,255
I have not the key.

1398
01:30:32,326 --> 01:30:33,623
I knew you'd come, Jim!

1399
01:30:33,694 --> 01:30:36,754
I'II have you out of there
in a minute, Davey.

1400
01:30:37,398 --> 01:30:38,797
What you do?

1401
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:47,334
Maria!

1402
01:30:48,476 --> 01:30:49,966
You stay here!

1403
01:30:50,077 --> 01:30:51,101
Sí,

1404
01:30:51,712 --> 01:30:53,441
(BANGING)

1405
01:31:09,997 --> 01:31:11,726
Jim! Gee,
I'm glad to see you!

1406
01:31:11,799 --> 01:31:12,993
I'm glad
to see you, Davey.

1407
01:31:19,774 --> 01:31:21,002
Where's Wahoo?

1408
01:31:21,075 --> 01:31:23,043
Well, Davey, I'II tell you
about Wahoo Iater.

1409
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:24,509
(DOOR OPENING)

1410
01:31:29,016 --> 01:31:30,040
Hello, Sam.

1411
01:31:30,117 --> 01:31:31,846
Keep 'em up, Jim.

1412
01:31:31,919 --> 01:31:33,784
Get back in the room,
and shut the door, Davey.

1413
01:31:33,855 --> 01:31:34,913
I wanna stay
with you, Jim.

1414
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:36,013
Do as I tell you.

1415
01:31:41,095 --> 01:31:43,325
Maria, get his guns.

1416
01:31:45,533 --> 01:31:49,025
Haven't you heard
that a Ranger
never gives up his guns?

1417
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:51,395
I got the drop on you, kid.

1418
01:31:51,839 --> 01:31:54,569
I see you have,
but it ain't gonna do you
any good.

1419
01:31:54,642 --> 01:31:57,805
You mean I have to kill you
standing there Iike that?

1420
01:31:57,879 --> 01:31:59,779
Not till I've killed you.

1421
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:02,839
You're all through, Sam.
You're all washed up.

1422
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:05,049
There ain't no more room
for your kind in Texas.

1423
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:08,155
I always Iiked you, Jim.

1424
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:10,680
You, too, Sam.

1425
01:32:11,826 --> 01:32:12,884
Why'd you kill Wahoo?

1426
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,121
Killing was too good for him.

1427
01:32:15,263 --> 01:32:17,493
I'II say for you,
you state your case plain.

1428
01:32:17,565 --> 01:32:19,590
I'II state it plain again.

1429
01:32:19,934 --> 01:32:23,802
I quit the Ranger service
because I didn't wanna go
out after you.

1430
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:25,668
Wahoo took my place.

1431
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:28,031
But I'm not quitting now.

1432
01:32:28,175 --> 01:32:30,473
Either you come along
with me peaceable,

1433
01:32:30,578 --> 01:32:32,876
or I'm gonna kill you
Iike you killed Wahoo.

1434
01:32:36,684 --> 01:32:40,450
Ah, Jim, you always was
the craziest maverick
I ever did know.

1435
01:32:40,521 --> 01:32:43,581
You stand there
talking about killing me.

1436
01:32:43,658 --> 01:32:45,421
AII I gotta do is
press my finger,

1437
01:32:45,493 --> 01:32:48,053
and I blow you
right through that door.

1438
01:32:48,129 --> 01:32:50,290
That don't mean nothing, Sam.

1439
01:32:50,364 --> 01:32:51,456
Soon as I hear a shot,

1440
01:32:51,532 --> 01:32:54,524
I'm gonna pull both my guns
and start pumping Iead
into you as fast as I can.

1441
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:57,232
Hey, Jim,

1442
01:32:58,906 --> 01:33:02,398
remember that gal
I took away from you
in Saint Louis, huh?

1443
01:33:02,476 --> 01:33:03,534
Arabella?

1444
01:33:03,611 --> 01:33:06,011
Yeah, Arabella.
Remember?

1445
01:33:06,814 --> 01:33:08,907
I'II tell you what I'II do.

1446
01:33:09,317 --> 01:33:11,114
Maria here,
she's a great gal.

1447
01:33:11,185 --> 01:33:13,779
She's a good cook.
She's on the Ievel.

1448
01:33:14,689 --> 01:33:17,055
Me and the boys
have been thinking about
moseying out California Way

1449
01:33:17,124 --> 01:33:21,254
for a Iong time.
I'II promise you.
We'II get out. We'II stay out.

1450
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:25,129
I've made a good stake.
You'II get your cut
as usual,

1451
01:33:27,702 --> 01:33:29,795
and I'm Ieaving Maria
behind me.

1452
01:33:31,672 --> 01:33:33,833
Come on, now,
what do you say?

1453
01:33:34,475 --> 01:33:37,933
I say you'd better
put away those guns
and come with me.

1454
01:33:38,346 --> 01:33:40,314
I don't want to kill you!

1455
01:33:54,161 --> 01:33:55,890
Drop your gun, Sam!

1456
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:28,955
I'II kill you!
So help me, I'II kill you!

1457
01:34:45,212 --> 01:34:46,270
Jim?

1458
01:34:46,714 --> 01:34:49,979
Jim, quit following me,
or so help me,
I'II kill you!

1459
01:34:50,051 --> 01:34:52,986
I'II kill you sure as
a rattler throws poison!

1460
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:09,101
Listen, Sam!

1461
01:35:09,270 --> 01:35:12,137
There might be
some chance for you
if you Iet me take you in!

1462
01:35:45,106 --> 01:35:48,974
Sam, either
you come out of there
with your hands up,

1463
01:35:49,844 --> 01:35:51,835
or I'm coming in
after you!

1464
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:07,391
AII right,

1465
01:36:09,797 --> 01:36:11,424
here I come!

1466
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:15,766
(COUGHING)

1467
01:36:33,921 --> 01:36:38,358
Well, Sam,
it had to be either you or me,
and I guess you Iost.

1468
01:36:47,101 --> 01:36:49,626
I hope maybe you
Iet him in up there.

1469
01:36:50,237 --> 01:36:53,070
He just got on
the wrong train.
That's all.

1470
01:36:57,311 --> 01:36:58,835
Henry V. Jones,

1471
01:36:59,613 --> 01:37:02,104
whom we affectionately
called Wahoo,

1472
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:04,307
died bravely.

1473
01:37:05,219 --> 01:37:07,949
His final home
shall be close to us here

1474
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:11,523
and to the service
that he had come to Iove.

1475
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:14,452
Jones vindicated
his errors,

1476
01:37:15,429 --> 01:37:19,422
and I say that
the soil of Texas shall be
all the more fertile

1477
01:37:19,934 --> 01:37:23,870
for the blood he shed
to the benefit of those
who come after him.

1478
01:37:24,371 --> 01:37:28,273
The men who have died
for Texas have not died
in vain,

1479
01:37:28,442 --> 01:37:31,673
Unsung though their names
may be in future years,

1480
01:37:31,812 --> 01:37:36,476
it shall be known
that in the turbulent years
of a state's transformation,

1481
01:37:36,951 --> 01:37:39,784
it was their deeds
of individual sacrifice,

1482
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:42,318
their acts
of dauntless courage,

1483
01:37:42,823 --> 01:37:46,054
that made possible
the changing
of a lawless frontier

1484
01:37:46,393 --> 01:37:48,258
into a civilized land,

1485
01:37:48,963 --> 01:37:52,160
These are the men
called Texas Rangers,

1486
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:55,898
molded in the crucible
of heroic struggle,

1487
01:37:56,770 --> 01:37:58,795
guardians of the frontier,

1488
01:38:00,074 --> 01:38:02,872
makers of the peace,
