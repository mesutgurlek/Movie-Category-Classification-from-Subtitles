1
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:41,521
 Follow the river

2
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:44,684
 The river knows the way

3
00:00:44,727 --> 00:00:47,366
 Come to me, I pray

4
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:50,319
 I miss you more each day

5
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:53,086
 Follow the river

6
00:00:53,127 --> 00:00:56,358
 Wherever you may be

7
00:00:56,407 --> 00:01:00,923
 Follow the river back to me

8
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:04,562
 Sometimes I feel like I could jump
over the moon

9
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:07,883
 And tell the sky above

10
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:10,282
 Does it matter how full the moon

11
00:01:10,327 --> 00:01:13,524
 When you've an empty heart

12
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:16,127
 Bring back the great love

13
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:19,284
 The love that once we knew

14
00:01:19,327 --> 00:01:22,046
 Make my dreams come true

15
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:25,284
 The dream I had with you

16
00:01:25,327 --> 00:01:27,557
 Follow the river

17
00:01:27,607 --> 00:01:30,758
 Wherever you may be

18
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:35,323
 Follow the river back to me

19
00:01:59,847 --> 00:02:02,281
 Follow the river

20
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:05,478
 Wherever you may be

21
00:02:05,527 --> 00:02:09,839
 Follow the river back to me?

22
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:19,685
(Man) I'd better get back to work.
Don't lose all your matches.

23
00:02:19,727 --> 00:02:22,799
- Hello, Mac.
- Hi, Click. Howdy, folks.

24
00:02:22,847 --> 00:02:25,236
- Hi.
- Hello.

25
00:02:25,287 --> 00:02:29,166
Welcome home, man.
Come sit down and give us a tune.

26
00:02:29,207 --> 00:02:33,439
- We'll pay you with promises.
- A man can't eat promises.

27
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,478
He can't lose them at cards either.

28
00:02:35,527 --> 00:02:37,597
McLaine!

29
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:41,003
- No, indeed he can't.
- Where have you been and why?

30
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:44,357
They were laying track in Wyoming.
Needed a troubleshooter.

31
00:02:44,407 --> 00:02:46,841
- Didn't need me.
- That's too bad.

32
00:02:46,887 --> 00:02:50,402
You can pick up a few nickels
and dimes playing your accordion.

33
00:02:50,447 --> 00:02:53,200
That's right, Tim. What's this?

34
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,721
Playing cards with matches?
When's payday?

35
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:59,406
Tomorrow, if they get the money past
Whitey Harbin.

36
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:02,723
Which they won't.
He's tapped that pay train three times up.

37
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:05,645
They'll get it past him
or get no more steel before snow.

38
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:08,884
- O'Brien, shut your mouth!
- My sentiments exactly.

39
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:12,556
Day shift and night shift, night shift
and day shift. No money in a month.

40
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:15,758
My patience is ended.
So is their railroad. Am I right?

41
00:03:15,807 --> 00:03:18,401
- You are right!
- McLaine.

42
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:22,042
Please play me a peaceful tune
or I'll have a revolution on my hands.

43
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:24,999
I see what you mean.
Are they giving you trouble?

44
00:03:25,047 --> 00:03:28,278
Lucky you're not with the railroad.
Tis a weary man you'd be today

45
00:03:28,327 --> 00:03:30,318
if you were troubleshooting for us.

46
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:32,358
Could be you're right, Tim.

47
00:03:32,407 --> 00:03:34,318
(? Folk tune)

48
00:03:39,047 --> 00:03:41,322
Come on, pretty lady. Give us a dance!

49
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:43,005
I dare you, Mr Feeney.

50
00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:45,242
Where's the wife?

51
00:03:45,287 --> 00:03:47,084
Come on!

52
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:01,086
Big Ed, are you through to Junction City?

53
00:04:01,127 --> 00:04:03,516
This is for Kimball.

54
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:08,322
As per your instructions, this is to advise you

55
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:11,916
that Grant McLaine is here at end of track.

56
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:16,437
You don't need that last. Just say he's here.

57
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,918
Get away from him! Get away from him!

58
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,037
Dancing, is it? Let me...

59
00:04:38,087 --> 00:04:42,319
Get back into your tent where you belong,
you painted women.

60
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,916
You and your railroad.
Bringing the likes of this among decent folk.

61
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:49,960
For two cents I'd take me old man back
to Junction City and be through with you.

62
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:51,884
If you had two cents!

63
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:56,364
They're at it again. You can't mix
wives and women, even to build a railroad.

64
00:04:56,407 --> 00:05:01,197
Stop this shilly-shally music
and give me a jig I can dance to.

65
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:03,238
Give us a jig, I said.

66
00:05:04,207 --> 00:05:06,118
You watch your feet. They're heavy.

67
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:09,045
And so is my fist.
Do I get a jig or do you lose your teeth?

68
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:11,123
Not now, Mac, not now.

69
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:14,955
He's not bad. He's just a fool.

70
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:18,725
Consider yourself lucky.

71
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,440
Five years ago you'd have got
a bullet between the eyes.

72
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:25,002
I've seen him kill men
that could eat you without salt.

73
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:30,082
Play what you please.

74
00:05:33,607 --> 00:05:35,598
(? Lively jig)

75
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:40,322
- You asked for a jig, now dance to it!
- Here I go, Feeney!

76
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:42,358
Hee-hee!

77
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:46,843
Up Garryowen!

78
00:05:48,687 --> 00:05:51,963
? I was farming in Missouri
I was getting tired of that

79
00:05:52,007 --> 00:05:55,363
? So I bought myself a satchel
and a stovepipe hat

80
00:05:55,407 --> 00:05:58,558
? And I headed for the station
gonna travel all about

81
00:05:58,607 --> 00:06:01,804
? But there wasn't any station
and I soon found out

82
00:06:01,847 --> 00:06:05,317
? That you can't get far without a railroad

83
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:08,598
? You can't get far without a railroad

84
00:06:08,647 --> 00:06:11,639
? Something's gotta take you there
and gotta bring you back

85
00:06:11,687 --> 00:06:15,236
? Oh, you can't go any distance
in a buggy or a hack

86
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:18,085
? You can't get far without a railroad

87
00:06:18,527 --> 00:06:21,564
? You can't get far without a railroad

88
00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:24,644
? You gotta have an engine
and you gotta have a track

89
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:27,884
? Oh, you can't get far without a railroad?

90
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:32,646
I haven't heard that one.
Where does it come from?

91
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:36,202
Dad used to play it
when it got too rough around the house.

92
00:06:36,247 --> 00:06:39,683
Pretty soon us kids would stop fighting
and start dancing.

93
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:50,196
The man makes fine music. Are we gonna
let them use it all up? Go on with you!

94
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:58,237
Clarence Feeney, stop looking at them
painted hussies and give your wife a dance.

95
00:06:58,287 --> 00:07:00,721
- Go away, woman, I'm tired.
- Tired, is it?

96
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:04,362
This is my day for dancing or fighting.
Which will you have?

97
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:07,398
Darling.

98
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:18,757
Nice work. I'll give you five dollars tomorrow.

99
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:20,798
If Whitey lets the pay train through.

100
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:22,997
Three times is enough. He won't hit it again.

101
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:26,164
Oh, don't bet on it.
He's a strange man, this Whitey Harbin.

102
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:31,327
He's got the big boss plenty worried.
Speaking of Kimball, he wants to see you.

103
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:35,280
- How would he know where I am?
- I told him. Here.

104
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:40,242
You read it. I'm afraid if I stop the music,
Mrs Feeney'll hit me with something.

105
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,757
"Report to me at once in Junction City.
Urgent. Ben Kimball."

106
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:47,641
- Maybe he'll give you...
- Another chance? No. That's not his way.

107
00:07:47,687 --> 00:07:51,441
- But you will see him?
- Not till they've finished their dance.

108
00:08:04,847 --> 00:08:07,441
- You old hag, I'll...
- Painted hussy!

109
00:08:08,847 --> 00:08:10,758
(Groaning)

110
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:12,957
Let go of me! Let go!

111
00:08:13,007 --> 00:08:14,998
Let her go, I said!

112
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:18,563
(Woman screams)

113
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,320
(Groaning)

114
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:28,119
(Stops playing)

115
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:30,158
(Shouting)

116
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:33,958
(Screaming)

117
00:08:35,287 --> 00:08:36,959
- Hold this.
- Right.

118
00:08:37,007 --> 00:08:40,682
And this is the tune your father used to play
to keep peace in the house?

119
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:43,002
I must have squeezed out
a few wrong notes.

120
00:08:43,047 --> 00:08:44,844
Yeah.

121
00:08:44,887 --> 00:08:47,242
- Thanks, Tim.
- Goodbye, Mac.

122
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:54,198
(Woman screeches)

123
00:09:07,487 --> 00:09:11,162
- Too late for coffee, mister?
- (Woman) Howdy.

124
00:09:11,207 --> 00:09:13,675
I think there's a few warm dregs left.

125
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:17,083
- Oh. Howdy, ma'am.
- Step down.

126
00:09:18,887 --> 00:09:21,117
Much obliged.

127
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:25,166
- They keeping you busy?
- Yep.

128
00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:28,643
Packing out the ore
and packing in the vittles.

129
00:09:28,687 --> 00:09:32,157
Them miners can eat more beans
than they raise in all of Boston.

130
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:34,960
- Now they want me to bring in a mill.
- All at once?

131
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,804
No, just a few pieces at a time.

132
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:39,680
They got tired of waiting for the railroad
to reach them.

133
00:09:39,727 --> 00:09:42,400
Between you and me,
I don't think it will before snow.

134
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:44,358
You're hoping it won't?

135
00:09:44,407 --> 00:09:45,965
- First I was.
- Uh-huh.

136
00:09:46,007 --> 00:09:48,680
Figured it'd put me out of business. It won't.

137
00:09:48,727 --> 00:09:51,446
- It won't?
- No. It's a funny thing about gold.

138
00:09:51,487 --> 00:09:54,923
There's always some jackass
will find it where the railroad ain't.

139
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:57,606
Then he'll send for me
and a few more jackasses

140
00:09:57,647 --> 00:10:00,320
to bring in his grub and pack out his ore!

141
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,483
Them crazy miners!

142
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:04,916
Look at the waste of that good machinery.

143
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:07,197
Two miles of cable and buckets to go with it.

144
00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:09,442
Last week they up and left the whole thing!

145
00:10:09,487 --> 00:10:12,206
Did the vein pinch out
or did they hit low grade?

146
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:14,477
They didn't hit nothing but blue sky.

147
00:10:15,287 --> 00:10:16,766
Uh-huh.

148
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:20,595
- This was mighty fine coffee, Mrs...
- Miss Vittles.

149
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:23,639
Miss Vittles. I sure appreciate it.

150
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:27,123
- I got a long ride ahead of me.
- You heading for Junction City too?

151
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:31,046
Yes, ma'am. But I'm kind of in a hurry.

152
00:10:31,087 --> 00:10:34,682
I ain't looking for company.
Ten jackasses in a bunch is enough.

153
00:10:34,727 --> 00:10:37,560
- I can save you a trip round the mountain.
- How's that?

154
00:10:37,607 --> 00:10:41,395
Like I told you, the boys hit a good vein,
followed it through the mountain.

155
00:10:41,447 --> 00:10:45,838
Last week they busted out on the far side
and there wasn't nothing there but blue sky.

156
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,765
Makes a mighty fine short cut into town.

157
00:10:48,807 --> 00:10:51,560
- It sure does.
- Still think I'm crazy?

158
00:10:52,607 --> 00:10:55,121
- I think you're real pretty.
- Ah!

159
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:58,637
- You going to spend time in these hills?
- Yes, ma'am.

160
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,042
When snow comes
you're gonna need a woman.

161
00:11:02,647 --> 00:11:05,207
Or a warm coat,
else you'll freeze your knees.

162
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,715
Well, I can't rightly afford a warm coat.

163
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:10,758
So long, Miss Vittles.

164
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:52,560
People wonder what a calf feels
when he gets roped. Now you can tell 'em.

165
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,359
What for are you mixing in?

166
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:58,241
Maybe I don't like to see kids get hurt.
Break any bones, son?

167
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:00,482
He's got a knife behind his collar!

168
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:29,965
- There's a stirrup. You want a lift?
- No.

169
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:33,686
- Why not?
- I'm beholden to you, mister.

170
00:13:33,727 --> 00:13:36,082
Couldn't we just leave it that way?

171
00:13:57,647 --> 00:14:00,115
- Morning.
- Morning.

172
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:02,078
- Put him up?
- For how long?

173
00:14:02,127 --> 00:14:05,324
- I wouldn't know.
- It'll be two bits for oats.

174
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:08,962
- Ain't I seen you before?
- Depends on where you've been.

175
00:14:09,007 --> 00:14:12,238
- I follow the railroad, mostly.
- Could be you've seen me.

176
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:16,121
- It'll be four bits if he stays the night.
- Fair enough.

177
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:20,163
Morning. Did a man ride in today -
tall, sort of heavyset?

178
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:23,643
- You mean him, Mr Renner?
- Not him. This one had a scar.

179
00:14:23,687 --> 00:14:25,723
Along his cheek?

180
00:14:25,767 --> 00:14:28,440
No, sir. I don't see no man with a scar.

181
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:46,159
I guess maybe I can have
some apple pie and coffee.

182
00:14:46,207 --> 00:14:50,598
I guess you could have eggs with bacon
if you wanted eggs with bacon.

183
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:54,126
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Grant.

184
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:57,523
It's good to see you, Charlie.
It's awful good to see you.

185
00:14:57,567 --> 00:14:59,683
It's good to see you too.

186
00:15:00,887 --> 00:15:04,038
- I'll get the eggs.
- No, get the pie. I can pay for the pie.

187
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:08,602
You're a very stubborn man.
Apple pie is not for breakfast.

188
00:15:08,647 --> 00:15:11,798
It is if you like apple pie. Now I need a fork.

189
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:16,683
- Working here long?
- About three weeks.

190
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:20,122
How's the Utica Kid?

191
00:15:21,647 --> 00:15:24,081
He was well...

192
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:26,357
when I saw him last.

193
00:15:27,087 --> 00:15:29,078
When was that?

194
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:32,438
- Good morning.
- Morning.

195
00:15:32,487 --> 00:15:35,240
Well, business is early and Pete is late.

196
00:15:35,287 --> 00:15:37,403
The lunches. Are they fixed?

197
00:15:38,407 --> 00:15:41,285
Why do I ask?
The lunches are always fixed.

198
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:43,238
Why? Because you fix them.

199
00:15:43,287 --> 00:15:47,644
Charlie, I'll make you an omelette
like only Pete can make an omelette.

200
00:15:47,687 --> 00:15:49,484
Very bad.

201
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,485
Come on around,
sit down, have a cup of coffee.

202
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:58,237
Pete had that place in Santa Fe, remember?

203
00:15:58,287 --> 00:16:00,278
Are you running a shoe store on the side?

204
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:02,841
Those are box lunches for the work train.

205
00:16:02,887 --> 00:16:05,560
Money, money, money.
Pete knows how to make it.

206
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:07,837
He follows the railroad.

207
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:10,447
I guess a lot of people follow the railroad.

208
00:16:10,487 --> 00:16:12,523
You and Pete.

209
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:14,558
The Utica Kid.

210
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:18,717
I asked when you saw him last.

211
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:22,203
They've lost three payrolls.
Now when did you see him last?

212
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:27,685
- Charlie, where did I put my apron?
- It's under here.

213
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:32,517
You must be nice fella. If Charlie sits
with you, you must be nice fella.

214
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:34,558
I make omelette for you too.

215
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:40,686
We were talking about the Utica Kid.

216
00:16:40,727 --> 00:16:44,640
He can wait. Ben Kimball's in town.
They put his car on the siding yesterday.

217
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:47,281
- I know.
- His wife is with him.

218
00:16:47,327 --> 00:16:49,443
Is she?

219
00:16:49,487 --> 00:16:53,400
I often wondered what Verna was like.
I saw her last night.

220
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:56,280
All fine silk and feathers.

221
00:16:56,327 --> 00:16:58,921
She's soft and beautiful.

222
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:00,958
And I can understand now.

223
00:17:01,007 --> 00:17:02,998
Can you?

224
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:05,481
How long are you gonna be in town?

225
00:17:05,527 --> 00:17:09,964
- That depends on Ben Kimball.
- You working for the railroad again?

226
00:17:11,727 --> 00:17:13,797
- If I am?
- That would be good.

227
00:17:13,847 --> 00:17:16,600
Playing the accordion's not for you,
not for a living.

228
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:19,719
You belong to the railroad
and it belongs to you.

229
00:17:20,727 --> 00:17:23,605
There were a lot of things
that used to belong to me

230
00:17:23,647 --> 00:17:25,842
and somehow I lost them.

231
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:30,083
(Pete) Two omelettes a-comin' up.

232
00:17:31,127 --> 00:17:32,924
- Do you like eggs?
- No.

233
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:35,686
That's too bad.
You got an omelette coming up.

234
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:43,478
Well, somebody's gotta eat them. Come on.

235
00:17:43,527 --> 00:17:45,199
That means you.

236
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:48,641
- Could you put it in a box?
- An omelette?

237
00:17:48,687 --> 00:17:52,566
I'll be hungrier when I get to end of track.
Maybe it will go down easy.

238
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:54,916
Easy or not, it goes down right now.

239
00:17:55,927 --> 00:17:58,122
I can't pay for it.

240
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:01,159
Then you can help me sell lunches
at the station.

241
00:18:01,207 --> 00:18:03,198
Any more arguments?

242
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:10,518
(Train rattling)

243
00:18:12,527 --> 00:18:14,518
(Train whistle)

244
00:18:16,487 --> 00:18:18,079
(Knocking)

245
00:18:18,127 --> 00:18:20,118
Come in.

246
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:26,680
- You want to see me, Ben?
- I certainly do.

247
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:31,678
Hello, Grant.

248
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,478
Sit down.

249
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:38,480
All right, Jeff.

250
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:42,964
Renner, go to Pete's and get
one breakfast and a jug of coffee.

251
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:45,521
- You haven't eaten yet?
- I've eaten.

252
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:48,525
Just get coffee. Hot.

253
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:52,116
- How's everything been going?
- I make a living.

254
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:54,317
- Playing an accordion?
- That's right.

255
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,959
Want me to play a tune for you?

256
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:58,157
There's other jobs besides railroading.

257
00:18:58,207 --> 00:19:02,280
Well, Colorado may be big in miles.
It's kinda short on people.

258
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:06,081
So when a man gets fired the way
I was fired the story gets around.

259
00:19:06,607 --> 00:19:08,882
Well, I'm... I'm sorry.

260
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:12,602
- No, I like to make music.
- And it keeps you near the railroad.

261
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:16,925
If someone needs information
about a payroll, you can sell it.

262
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:21,960
You know it's a funny thing.
I don't like you either.

263
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:25,966
- Is that why you sent for me?
- No. And keep out of this.

264
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:28,316
Have it your way. But I don't trust him now

265
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,359
any more than I did
when I sent him after the Utica Kid.

266
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:35,036
I sent you after a thief
and you gave him a horse to get away on.

267
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:39,365
- I told you to keep shut.
- Let him talk. I'm not wearing a gun.

268
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:43,280
I'll be honest with you.
He'd talk the same if I was.

269
00:19:43,327 --> 00:19:45,887
- It's been nice seeing you.
- (Woman) Grant.

270
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,921
I'm sure Jeff didn't mean to be rude.

271
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:55,998
Sometimes he has
a blunt way of putting things.

272
00:19:56,047 --> 00:19:58,322
Unfortunately, Ben isn't much better.

273
00:19:58,367 --> 00:20:01,962
It's not unfortunate.
It just gets things said in a hurry.

274
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:03,804
Too much of a hurry.

275
00:20:03,847 --> 00:20:08,875
They forgot to ask you if you'd work
for the railroad again. Would you?

276
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:11,999
Yes, I would. Not to give you a short answer.

277
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:15,005
- It's the answer I wanted.
- Sit down, Grant.

278
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,924
Do you remember Whitey Harbin?

279
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:19,356
Used to work down
in Arizona and New Mexico.

280
00:20:19,407 --> 00:20:21,875
- Yeah.
- Well, he's moved into Colorado.

281
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:24,487
I thought he favoured stage lines and banks.

282
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:27,678
So did we. But he's learned
about railroad payrolls

283
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:31,242
- and he's grabbed three in a row.
- Where do I fit in?

284
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:34,040
They're making up a supply train in the yard.

285
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:36,726
I want you to ride it.

286
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:40,885
- With $10,000 in your pocket.
- Why me?

287
00:20:40,927 --> 00:20:45,000
Quite frankly, because no one
would suspect you of carrying a payroll.

288
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,125
I sure don't look like $10,000, do I?

289
00:20:52,727 --> 00:20:54,718
Are you building a bridge you don't need?

290
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:59,124
The money's here. Why not bring the men in
on Saturday and pay them off in town?

291
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:01,840
And lose half the crew?
Turn them loose in a mining town,

292
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:04,003
they'll go up the hills looking for gold.

293
00:21:04,047 --> 00:21:08,199
It won't work. And we have to finish
this section before snow comes.

294
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:12,240
That's a pretty big gamble on a man
who gave his horse to a thief!

295
00:21:12,287 --> 00:21:15,484
Yes. You might as well know
the deck's stacked against you.

296
00:21:15,527 --> 00:21:19,725
A boxcar will be hooked to the train.
I'll be one of the men in it.

297
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:21,678
- When did this happen?
- Last week.

298
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:23,319
- Renner, did you know?
- Yes.

299
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,927
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I told him not to.

300
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:28,765
- Why?
- Everything we plan gets back to Whitey.

301
00:21:28,807 --> 00:21:31,719
- You think I'd tell him?
- You might trust the wrong people.

302
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:34,679
- If he takes the job, I'm sure of it.
- And if I don't take it?

303
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,321
Then Jeff will be sitting in Ben's chair.

304
00:21:38,847 --> 00:21:41,236
Oh, I wouldn't like that.

305
00:21:41,287 --> 00:21:43,084
Uh-uh.

306
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:48,277
So I'll take the job on one condition.

307
00:21:48,327 --> 00:21:51,558
If I make the delivery I get his job.

308
00:21:54,887 --> 00:21:56,684
You made a deal.

309
00:22:00,647 --> 00:22:02,956
Thank you.

310
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:12,319
Wait a minute.

311
00:22:12,367 --> 00:22:17,361
It's getting cold up in the hills.
This coat has always been too long for me.

312
00:22:17,407 --> 00:22:19,318
Thanks.

313
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:29,286
Well. I thought you didn't like him.

314
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:33,878
He said that. I said I didn't trust him.
And I still don't.

315
00:22:40,607 --> 00:22:42,404
(Verna) Grant.

316
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:50,203
Are you surprised Ben sent for you?

317
00:22:50,247 --> 00:22:54,081
I was until I talked to him.
He seems to have changed.

318
00:22:54,127 --> 00:22:55,719
You're right.

319
00:22:55,767 --> 00:23:00,841
He doesn't belong in a private car with
clerks, figures and pressure from the office.

320
00:23:00,887 --> 00:23:04,516
He belongs at the end of track,
running a gang and building a railroad.

321
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:09,083
- He's a working stiff like you.
- Yes, but he can dream a little too.

322
00:23:09,127 --> 00:23:12,756
Colorado wouldn't have a railroad
if he hadn't sold them on the idea.

323
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:15,719
For his sake, I wish he hadn't.
He was happy at end of track

324
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:18,361
but they kicked him upstairs
and sent us to Chicago.

325
00:23:18,407 --> 00:23:22,446
- And now he needs a little help.
- That's why he sent for you.

326
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:26,923
Oh, I may have had something to do with it.

327
00:23:26,967 --> 00:23:28,878
Why?

328
00:23:28,927 --> 00:23:31,566
There was a time
when you were interested in me.

329
00:23:31,607 --> 00:23:35,156
I was more than interested in you.
I wanted to marry you.

330
00:23:35,887 --> 00:23:40,119
Times when I'm sorry you didn't.
Aren't you?

331
00:23:41,847 --> 00:23:43,439
No.

332
00:23:44,407 --> 00:23:48,366
A man likes to know his woman will
back him when he's down and you didn't.

333
00:23:49,447 --> 00:23:53,076
Ben called me a thief
and you went right along with him.

334
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:55,118
It's as simple as that.

335
00:23:57,567 --> 00:23:59,239
Grant.

336
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:02,958
For old times' sake.

337
00:24:08,607 --> 00:24:13,044
For old times' sake?
Just that and nothing more?

338
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:15,123
Perhaps just a little more.

339
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:17,920
We want to be sure
that payroll goes through, don't we?

340
00:24:17,967 --> 00:24:21,437
I don't know. Maybe Jeff is right.
His type seldom changes.

341
00:24:21,487 --> 00:24:24,923
And if we've made a mistake,
it's the finish of everything.

342
00:24:24,967 --> 00:24:28,039
Then why not cut this car
into the supply train?

343
00:24:28,087 --> 00:24:33,002
If we're all playing showdown,
I'd like to see the cards when they fall.

344
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:37,083
- Thank you. I hope you have a nice trip.
- Thank you.

345
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:39,004
(Train whistle)

346
00:24:39,927 --> 00:24:42,077
- Ma'am, is that all?
- Mm-hm.

347
00:24:42,127 --> 00:24:45,278
- Here's your lunch. You've earned it.
- Thanks.

348
00:24:51,007 --> 00:24:53,475
- Mister, are you going to end of track?
- Yes.

349
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:57,645
Could you stake me to a ticket?
I can ride half fare if I'm with an adult.

350
00:24:57,687 --> 00:25:01,123
- And you're an adult.
- Well, sometimes I wonder.

351
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:05,399
All right. You can come along. We'll ride
with the other fellas with no money.

352
00:25:05,447 --> 00:25:07,881
- On the flatcar?
- Go on. Climb aboard.

353
00:25:07,927 --> 00:25:11,636
Plenty of fresh air.
Do you good, make you grow.

354
00:25:23,047 --> 00:25:24,844
(Clunking)

355
00:25:25,847 --> 00:25:27,758
(Train whistle)

356
00:25:35,207 --> 00:25:37,596
Are you sure he didn't come
while I was away?

357
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:40,684
Ain't nobody been here
but the man riding the sorrel.

358
00:25:40,727 --> 00:25:43,400
- What colour horse your man riding?
- How should I know?

359
00:25:43,447 --> 00:25:46,200
It's extremely important that I see him.

360
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:51,286
They've cut in Mr Kimball's car.

361
00:25:56,447 --> 00:25:58,244
Barley!

362
00:25:59,287 --> 00:26:01,847
A man told you to put his horse up...

363
00:26:01,887 --> 00:26:05,721
Don't start that too. That there sorrel
is the only horse what come in.

364
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:07,723
That there sorrel is the horse I want.

365
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:09,803
He belongs to my friend Grant McLaine.

366
00:26:09,847 --> 00:26:12,486
McLaine? That's who it is.

367
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:15,644
I knew him as a troubleshooter
in Santa Fe before he went bad.

368
00:26:15,687 --> 00:26:18,121
- He didn't go bad.
- What'll you do with his horse?

369
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:21,045
- Ride him! I'll change, you saddle him.
- All right.

370
00:26:21,087 --> 00:26:22,918
(Train chugging)

371
00:26:24,247 --> 00:26:26,238
(Train whistle)

372
00:26:28,727 --> 00:26:30,718
Hey, Pilgrim!

373
00:26:31,527 --> 00:26:34,325
Come here!
Don't go getting your liver all upset.

374
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:37,837
- Once you miss 'em, they stay missed.
- It's none of your business.

375
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:41,277
- Could be. You wanting to get on that car?
- If I am?

376
00:26:41,327 --> 00:26:44,319
- I can take you to where it's going.
- On one of these?

377
00:26:44,367 --> 00:26:47,404
They'll get you to end of track
before the train does.

378
00:26:47,447 --> 00:26:51,042
- That's ridiculous.
- $100 agin yours I'm right.

379
00:26:51,087 --> 00:26:53,920
- You've got a bet.
- And you got stuck.

380
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:56,356
Here. I'll let you ride Flap Ears.

381
00:28:33,487 --> 00:28:36,923
- You can smoke inside, mister.
- I can smoke where I want.

382
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:40,642
You can burn too if it pleases you
but it'll still cost you four bits.

383
00:28:40,687 --> 00:28:43,042
- For what?
- Travelling first-class.

384
00:28:43,087 --> 00:28:45,157
Otherwise ride the flats.

385
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:16,358
(Discordant notes)

386
00:29:20,127 --> 00:29:22,960
- You play that?
- Yeah, I play it.

387
00:29:23,007 --> 00:29:25,237
- When?
- When?

388
00:29:25,287 --> 00:29:28,723
Whenever somebody
throws a dime in my hat.

389
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,362
- I ain't got a dime.
- This one's on me.

390
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,558
(? Folk tune)

391
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:39,644
- Been up here before?
- Part way.

392
00:29:39,687 --> 00:29:42,406
- What takes you to end of track?
- A job.

393
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,403
Figured I'd get one at Junction City.

394
00:29:44,447 --> 00:29:46,403
They told me the foremen do the hiring.

395
00:29:46,447 --> 00:29:49,041
You're a little small for swinging a sledge.

396
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:52,318
- I can carry water.
- Yeah, you can carry water.

397
00:29:52,367 --> 00:29:54,676
- Very important job.
- (Man) Hey!

398
00:29:56,727 --> 00:30:00,322
- What are you doing here?
- He's with me, Pick.

399
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:04,406
- Where did you get him?
- Somebody threw him away.

400
00:30:04,447 --> 00:30:08,201
Don't you throw him away.
He'll get lost in the mountains.

401
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:12,722
Who tells the men who build railroads
how to get through the mountains?

402
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:14,758
- The river.
- Huh?

403
00:30:15,807 --> 00:30:17,923
They just follow the river.

404
00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:23,995
- Who told you that?
- I guess my dad was the first.

405
00:30:24,047 --> 00:30:26,038
He had a little song about it.

406
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:29,886
? Follow the river

407
00:30:29,927 --> 00:30:33,158
? The river knows the way

408
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:36,040
? Hearts can go astray

409
00:30:36,087 --> 00:30:39,682
? It happens every day

410
00:30:39,727 --> 00:30:42,639
? Follow the river

411
00:30:42,687 --> 00:30:45,838
? Wherever you may be

412
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:51,359
? Follow the river back to me?

413
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:23,356
Wouldn't you wanna be knowing
about Concho?

414
00:31:23,407 --> 00:31:26,444
- Who's Concho?
- The man you roped. Do you wanna know?

415
00:31:26,487 --> 00:31:28,478
Not unless you wanna tell me.

416
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:32,565
I ought to tell you. He's fast with a gun.

417
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:35,041
Only know two men who are faster.

418
00:31:35,087 --> 00:31:37,123
Which two men would they be?

419
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:40,045
Whitey Harbin for one.
I run away from Whitey.

420
00:31:40,087 --> 00:31:42,476
That's why Concho was after me.

421
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:44,518
You're one of Whitey's men?

422
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:48,799
No. I was in Montrose.
Whitey and his bunch were robbing a bank.

423
00:31:48,847 --> 00:31:50,644
I was just in the road watching.

424
00:31:50,687 --> 00:31:54,202
Whitey was all for killing me
but the other fellow wouldn't let him.

425
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:56,636
He swung me up into the saddle and said,

426
00:31:56,687 --> 00:31:59,485
"You ain't killing a kid.
Not while I ride with you."

427
00:31:59,527 --> 00:32:03,202
- Whitey, he backed down.
- Cos the fella's faster with a gun?

428
00:32:03,247 --> 00:32:05,363
Like lightning.

429
00:32:05,407 --> 00:32:07,602
This other fella, does he have a name?

430
00:32:07,647 --> 00:32:10,400
He's got a name. The Utica Kid.

431
00:32:10,447 --> 00:32:12,881
I'd have stayed with the bunch
if he was boss.

432
00:32:12,927 --> 00:32:15,441
- But he's not?
- Not yet.

433
00:32:15,487 --> 00:32:19,639
Always he's shoving pins into Whitey,
laughing at him, driving him crazy.

434
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:24,602
Even crazier than he is!
Someday Whitey will crack and he'll lose.

435
00:32:24,647 --> 00:32:26,638
(Train whistle)

436
00:32:28,727 --> 00:32:31,036
Is this the fresh air you were talking about?

437
00:32:31,087 --> 00:32:34,045
How come them fellas can ride inside?

438
00:32:34,087 --> 00:32:36,806
Well, it's the old story of good and evil.

439
00:32:36,847 --> 00:32:40,760
If you spend all your money on whiskey,
you have none left for a ticket.

440
00:32:40,807 --> 00:32:43,719
Don't drink. Then you'd have six bits
when you need it.

441
00:32:43,767 --> 00:32:45,758
That's very true.

442
00:32:46,847 --> 00:32:50,203
Tell you what, maybe I have six bits.

443
00:32:50,247 --> 00:32:51,760
Yeah.

444
00:32:51,807 --> 00:32:55,117
What do you say we go in
and spend it? Come on.

445
00:33:04,087 --> 00:33:07,124
Guess I wasn't tough enough
to follow the river that way.

446
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:09,681
Sometimes it isn't easy travelling upstream.

447
00:33:09,727 --> 00:33:12,082
- That will be a dollar.
- That'll be six bits.

448
00:33:12,127 --> 00:33:14,163
I'm the adult.

449
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:17,003
Here. Hold on to that.

450
00:33:22,927 --> 00:33:25,122
- Don't worry about Concho.
- You would if...

451
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:27,158
Oh, no, come on. Sit down.

452
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:38,042
We can both worry together
if you want to tell me about it.

453
00:33:38,087 --> 00:33:41,875
- It's nothing.
- And if it was, you'd rather not say.

454
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:46,836
All right. I broke with Whitey.
Doesn't mean I have to talk.

455
00:33:46,887 --> 00:33:48,878
No, you don't have to talk.

456
00:33:49,647 --> 00:33:52,081
I even broke with the Utica Kid.

457
00:34:35,647 --> 00:34:38,559
- Hi, Utica.
- Put him away, Howdy.

458
00:34:38,607 --> 00:34:40,802
Sure. Come on.

459
00:34:43,767 --> 00:34:45,758
It's a pretty good rig.

460
00:34:45,807 --> 00:34:47,923
Too good for the guy that owned it.

461
00:34:47,967 --> 00:34:51,357
Remember that draw you taught me?
It worked.

462
00:34:52,687 --> 00:34:55,520
He went down with his gun in the leather.

463
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:58,286
- And now you're an "in case" man.
- In case?

464
00:34:58,327 --> 00:35:01,558
Yeah. In case you miss six times with one,
you draw the other.

465
00:35:01,607 --> 00:35:05,361
- If you have time.
- I'll have time.

466
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:07,318
Call it.

467
00:35:09,927 --> 00:35:11,724
Draw!

468
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:17,401
You better learn to draw that one
before you fool around with the other.

469
00:35:17,447 --> 00:35:19,358
(Clanking)

470
00:35:32,527 --> 00:35:34,279
(Horse whinnies)

471
00:35:37,247 --> 00:35:39,124
About three inches high, Whitey.

472
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:43,285
You better take another look at that skull.
Next time it could be yours.

473
00:35:45,887 --> 00:35:49,197
Don't soft-foot up behind me!
It makes me nervous!

474
00:35:50,207 --> 00:35:52,198
So I notice.

475
00:35:54,407 --> 00:35:57,717
What else did you notice?
Did you see Concho?

476
00:36:00,887 --> 00:36:03,606
- Did you see him?
- He wasn't on the trail.

477
00:36:03,647 --> 00:36:07,003
Did I ask you where he wasn't?
I asked you did you see him?

478
00:36:07,047 --> 00:36:09,720
- I would've said so.
- Not straight out you wouldn't.

479
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,758
Because you're a funny man.

480
00:36:11,807 --> 00:36:14,196
You've always gotta be laughing inside.

481
00:36:14,247 --> 00:36:17,523
Well, go ahead, laugh. But get this, Kid.

482
00:36:17,567 --> 00:36:20,035
I'm a better gun than you.

483
00:36:20,087 --> 00:36:22,282
Or would you like to try?

484
00:36:24,007 --> 00:36:27,761
It's an interesting thought,
but I'm afraid of you, Whitey.

485
00:36:27,807 --> 00:36:30,719
(Laughs) You ain't afraid of me.

486
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:35,636
And in your feet, where your brains are,
you think maybe you're just a bit faster.

487
00:36:35,687 --> 00:36:37,598
And you know something?

488
00:36:37,647 --> 00:36:39,319
(Laughs) It could be.

489
00:36:40,287 --> 00:36:44,485
Before you break up completely,
you mind putting a name on this?

490
00:36:47,327 --> 00:36:49,204
It's just a little old wedge.

491
00:36:49,247 --> 00:36:52,159
But when you put it
through the latch of a boxcar,

492
00:36:52,207 --> 00:36:54,926
you can't open the door from the inside.

493
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:58,597
Now, you ask me,

494
00:36:58,647 --> 00:37:02,879
who would want to open the door
of a boxcar from the inside?

495
00:37:02,927 --> 00:37:06,966
- Jeff Kurth and a dozen gunmen.
- How would you know?

496
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:09,475
I was sleeping up there
when Concho told you.

497
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:12,121
You better learn how to snore!

498
00:37:29,967 --> 00:37:32,606
You wouldn't know
how to shoot a man in the back.

499
00:37:32,647 --> 00:37:34,638
I'll learn.

500
00:37:40,047 --> 00:37:44,598
What'll it be, gents? We got Old Grandpa,
Old Grandma, Old Uncle Tom.

501
00:37:44,647 --> 00:37:47,445
- And Old Empty.
- You ain't funny, Latigo.

502
00:37:48,447 --> 00:37:50,802
Who could be funny, sweating it out in here?

503
00:37:50,847 --> 00:37:54,396
Get away, boy. You're too young for whiskey
even if we had plenty.

504
00:37:54,447 --> 00:37:57,200
Don't get fancy. You ain't talking to Joey.

505
00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:04,438
Speaking of Joey, you didn't happen
to spot him along the trail, did you?

506
00:38:04,487 --> 00:38:07,957
I'll take a shot of that Old Flannelmouth.

507
00:38:09,327 --> 00:38:12,125
- Did you see him?
- No.

508
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:14,078
Did he leave any sign?

509
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:17,244
A little. He was headed
toward Junction City.

510
00:38:17,287 --> 00:38:20,040
But you didn't follow him?

511
00:38:21,087 --> 00:38:25,205
Joey always was a nuisance.
I was for dropping him in the river.

512
00:38:31,967 --> 00:38:35,323
- Why didn't you?
- And get my brains shot out?

513
00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:37,756
You've got to find a better reason to kill me.

514
00:38:37,807 --> 00:38:40,321
Suppose Concho didn't catch up
with Joey in town

515
00:38:40,367 --> 00:38:42,278
and suppose the kid talked?

516
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:47,638
- He won't talk.
- Maybe not, but Concho ain't back.

517
00:38:47,687 --> 00:38:52,681
Unless he gets back, we won't know
where they're carrying the money.

518
00:38:52,727 --> 00:38:56,436
That's right. Maybe it'd be smart
to let this one go through.

519
00:38:56,487 --> 00:38:58,205
Why?

520
00:38:58,247 --> 00:39:01,080
We've grabbed three in a row.
Let's give them a breather.

521
00:39:01,127 --> 00:39:03,357
That makes sense. I go along with Utica.

522
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:06,205
You and me both.
We ought to let this one go through.

523
00:39:06,247 --> 00:39:08,363
It ain't going through!

524
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,240
Why not?

525
00:39:13,287 --> 00:39:16,757
You're the one who taught me about
payrolls and now I like them.

526
00:39:16,807 --> 00:39:18,479
- So do I.
- I'll buy that.

527
00:39:18,527 --> 00:39:21,724
A man can get saddle-sore
looking for a bank to take.

528
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:24,520
- I'm with Whitey.
- Me too.

529
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:26,717
What about you, Torgenson?

530
00:39:27,567 --> 00:39:30,559
I got no complaints. You call it, I'll play it.

531
00:39:31,847 --> 00:39:34,520
Looks like you've been outvoted.

532
00:39:34,567 --> 00:39:36,797
Or do you want a recount?

533
00:39:37,727 --> 00:39:40,605
- Right now, I'd rather have a drink.
- Suit yourself.

534
00:39:40,647 --> 00:39:43,639
If I can't buy a fight, I'll buy a drink.
Fill 'em up.

535
00:39:43,687 --> 00:39:45,678
Sorry, the bar is closed.

536
00:39:47,247 --> 00:39:50,205
On account of we're fresh out of whiskey.

537
00:39:53,367 --> 00:39:56,484
Either get this floor fixed
or get a new bartender.

538
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:00,281
When do we make the hit?

539
00:40:00,327 --> 00:40:03,956
Any time you're ready.
She was halfway up the grade when I left.

540
00:40:04,007 --> 00:40:05,918
Why didn't you tell me?

541
00:40:06,887 --> 00:40:08,684
Why didn't you ask me?

542
00:40:08,727 --> 00:40:11,560
Funny man! Mount up!

543
00:40:13,007 --> 00:40:15,726
Settle down. It's only another job.

544
00:40:15,767 --> 00:40:19,123
But if you was boss, we wouldn't do it.

545
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,078
If I was boss we wouldn't do it.

546
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,038
You ain't boss!

547
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:30,318
? So I bought myself a shovel
and I bought myself a pick

548
00:40:30,367 --> 00:40:33,643
? And I laid a little track
along the bullfrog crick

549
00:40:33,687 --> 00:40:36,759
? Then I built a locomotive
out of 20 empty cans

550
00:40:36,807 --> 00:40:40,004
? And I tooted on the whistle
and the darned thing ran

551
00:40:40,047 --> 00:40:43,437
? Oh, you can't get far without a railroad

552
00:40:43,487 --> 00:40:46,718
? You can't get far without a railroad

553
00:40:46,767 --> 00:40:49,998
? Something's gotta take you there
and gotta bring you back

554
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:52,800
? You can't go any distance
in a buggy or a hack?

555
00:41:01,327 --> 00:41:03,124
(Train whistle)

556
00:41:04,887 --> 00:41:07,879
Throw some ropes around them timbers.
We'll pull it down.

557
00:41:07,927 --> 00:41:09,918
Torgenson!

558
00:41:17,367 --> 00:41:20,086
- OK, John.
- Hurry it up, Jubilee!

559
00:41:49,687 --> 00:41:52,076
- Boy, they're pushing her fast today.
- Yeah!

560
00:41:52,127 --> 00:41:54,516
Maybe they heard
I needed a quick ten thousand.

561
00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:57,286
- That water tower your idea?
- What's wrong with it?

562
00:41:57,327 --> 00:42:00,125
Any self-respecting Injun
could walk away with it.

563
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:03,398
Funny man!
He knows everything about everything.

564
00:42:04,367 --> 00:42:06,835
Let's get down and lock the barn door.

565
00:42:58,647 --> 00:43:02,242
- (Neighing)
- We've stopped! Whitey's making his hit!

566
00:43:10,887 --> 00:43:14,516
- McLaine sold us out!
- No, Ben. They didn't learn it from Grant.

567
00:43:20,647 --> 00:43:22,638
Leary!

568
00:43:23,887 --> 00:43:25,445
- A hold-up!
- They did it again!

569
00:43:25,487 --> 00:43:28,206
Stop your moaning
and hold on to your hat!

570
00:43:52,887 --> 00:43:56,243
They won't stop old Tommy Shannon
with a tank full of water.

571
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:59,279
That's no way to treat railroad property,
Mr Shannon.

572
00:43:59,327 --> 00:44:03,115
Take your hand off the throttle
and reach for the brake!

573
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:12,439
All right. Sit down and behave!

574
00:44:22,207 --> 00:44:24,198
Come over here.

575
00:44:27,367 --> 00:44:29,358
Open the safe!

576
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,875
- Ha!
- Move in! Same as last time!

577
00:44:44,727 --> 00:44:48,356
- We thought you were lost or drunk.
- There ain't nothing in there.

578
00:44:48,407 --> 00:44:51,558
(Man) Jubilee! How are you making out?

579
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:53,598
Try to talk your way out of this!

580
00:45:01,087 --> 00:45:04,875
- I'm sorry I missed out with Renner.
- Never mind. Where's the money?

581
00:45:04,927 --> 00:45:07,316
- It's not in the safe.
- Then where is it?

582
00:45:07,367 --> 00:45:09,927
It could be going to Junction City
with Jeff's men.

583
00:45:09,967 --> 00:45:13,516
That's not true. Renner told us
Jeff wouldn't carry the payroll!

584
00:45:13,567 --> 00:45:16,081
That's a help. Least we know
who didn't carry it.

585
00:45:16,127 --> 00:45:20,200
Funny man! When you get through laughing,
see what's in that red car.

586
00:45:20,247 --> 00:45:23,603
Sure. Glad to.
As soon as I pick up my horse.

587
00:45:23,647 --> 00:45:27,276
He's worth more than anything
I'm gonna find on this train.

588
00:45:28,647 --> 00:45:31,639
Get those pilgrims out.
Maybe one of them is carrying it.

589
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,723
Hit the other cars! See if you can find it.

590
00:45:35,207 --> 00:45:37,118
Outside! All of you!

591
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,761
Is this what you wanted to tell me?

592
00:46:06,607 --> 00:46:08,723
Have a look inside, Latigo!

593
00:46:12,007 --> 00:46:14,316
If that's McLaine...

594
00:46:14,367 --> 00:46:16,483
No, Ben.

595
00:46:19,767 --> 00:46:21,758
Put it away.

596
00:46:28,167 --> 00:46:30,362
You may as well be comfortable.

597
00:46:34,407 --> 00:46:37,080
- Be my guest.
- Gladly.

598
00:46:40,287 --> 00:46:43,085
Do you mind if I ask the name of my host?

599
00:46:44,127 --> 00:46:47,961
No, I don't mind.
Would the payroll be in there?

600
00:46:48,007 --> 00:46:49,918
No.

601
00:46:49,967 --> 00:46:52,276
Why not take a look, just to be sure?

602
00:46:52,327 --> 00:46:55,683
Boy, is this stuff mellow.
Bottled in bond too.

603
00:46:57,567 --> 00:47:01,685
- I forgot. Ladies is always first.
- Thank you, no.

604
00:47:03,567 --> 00:47:04,966
See for yourself.

605
00:47:05,807 --> 00:47:08,401
Hello, Joey. What are you doing here?

606
00:47:08,447 --> 00:47:10,358
Getting robbed!

607
00:47:12,047 --> 00:47:14,880
Don't bother.
None of them's got more than two dollars.

608
00:47:14,927 --> 00:47:17,919
Whitey! There ain't no payroll in there.

609
00:47:22,687 --> 00:47:24,882
How come you missed out?

610
00:47:27,927 --> 00:47:30,885
- I had a little trouble.
- Now, ain't that too bad?

611
00:47:30,927 --> 00:47:33,361
- Maybe I ought to give you a little more.
- Whitey!

612
00:47:33,407 --> 00:47:35,716
Kimball's back there with his wife.

613
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,598
(Laughs)

614
00:47:39,847 --> 00:47:43,203
You just got lucky!
Put them back in the car!

615
00:47:45,327 --> 00:47:47,238
(Concho) Get aboard!

616
00:48:07,407 --> 00:48:09,398
Go on.

617
00:48:26,807 --> 00:48:29,162
Good little boys don't run away.

618
00:48:30,087 --> 00:48:32,157
This time you'll learn!

619
00:48:35,687 --> 00:48:38,884
- Where's the payroll?
- The man says he doesn't know.

620
00:48:38,927 --> 00:48:42,476
I can help him remember. Take her outside.

621
00:48:42,527 --> 00:48:45,405
Take her outside yourself.
I'm afraid of women.

622
00:48:45,447 --> 00:48:48,837
They scream and scratch,
and sometimes step on your toes.

623
00:48:48,887 --> 00:48:52,482
Don't say no to me.
Not when I got a gun in my hand.

624
00:48:52,527 --> 00:48:54,961
I won't.

625
00:48:55,007 --> 00:48:57,805
Unless I'm holding one too.

626
00:49:02,087 --> 00:49:04,555
- Outside.
- If you want the payroll...

627
00:49:04,607 --> 00:49:06,757
You'll have to wait for the next work train.

628
00:49:06,807 --> 00:49:10,083
We decided
not to send it through on this one.

629
00:49:10,127 --> 00:49:13,199
Oh? I don't mind waiting.

630
00:49:15,087 --> 00:49:18,079
I'll be at Pay Load. You can bring it to me.

631
00:49:18,127 --> 00:49:21,961
Then I'll take 12 hours' start,
you get your wife back.

632
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:33,206
See what happens when you don't
carry your brains in your feet?

633
00:49:46,287 --> 00:49:48,198
I ought to make you walk.

634
00:49:48,247 --> 00:49:51,557
Jubilee, lead them out. Step up with Latigo.

635
00:49:55,687 --> 00:49:58,645
(Concho) What about Joey?
You gonna leave him here?

636
00:49:58,687 --> 00:50:00,678
He'll ride with me.

637
00:50:04,007 --> 00:50:06,157
Or would you like to?

638
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:13,677
Settle down. We're getting $10,000
for the lady, remember?

639
00:50:17,927 --> 00:50:19,963
Which one do I ride with?

640
00:50:20,007 --> 00:50:22,567
(Laughs) Which one do you think?

641
00:50:39,367 --> 00:50:41,961
Take her to the end of track, Mr Shannon!

642
00:50:42,007 --> 00:50:43,884
(Train whistle)

643
00:50:52,647 --> 00:50:57,038
Here's a stirrup. Give you a lift?
I'll take that box.

644
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:06,557
Don't crowd the cantle. You'll ride easier.

645
00:52:13,687 --> 00:52:15,678
Whoa, mules!

646
00:52:21,247 --> 00:52:24,523
Must have got tired of making the climb
and started home.

647
00:52:24,567 --> 00:52:26,239
- Come on, boy!
- Just a minute.

648
00:52:26,287 --> 00:52:29,597
There's a mining town near here.
It used to be called Pay Load.

649
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:32,241
It's still called Pay Load
but nobody lives there.

650
00:52:32,287 --> 00:52:34,562
- It's over beyond that far hill.
- Which hill?

651
00:52:34,607 --> 00:52:36,484
- You see the first hill?
- Yes.

652
00:52:36,527 --> 00:52:42,159
See the second one? There's a third hill.
Pay Load's behind that.

653
00:52:42,207 --> 00:52:45,005
- How much do you want for this mule?
- $50.

654
00:52:49,287 --> 00:52:53,963
Flap Ears, when you unload this piker,
you come on home to mother.

655
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:55,679
- Get outta there!
- Gah!

656
00:52:55,727 --> 00:52:57,718
Welshing on a bet!

657
00:52:59,287 --> 00:53:02,563
Never could understand
them railroad people.

658
00:53:02,607 --> 00:53:04,359
Come on! Come on!

659
00:53:12,407 --> 00:53:14,398
(Train whistle)

660
00:53:14,447 --> 00:53:17,598
- Mr Kimball.
- Come over to the telegraph shack.

661
00:53:18,847 --> 00:53:21,600
- Before you pass. Did you bring the payroll?
- Not now!

662
00:53:21,647 --> 00:53:23,683
- Did you bring it?
- I didn't.

663
00:53:23,727 --> 00:53:25,638
- Now what?
- The end of the railroad.

664
00:53:25,687 --> 00:53:27,359
- Shut up, Feeney.
- Let go of me

665
00:53:27,407 --> 00:53:29,637
or I'll push this down your throat!

666
00:53:29,687 --> 00:53:33,282
Who wants your man?
I don't want none of 'em! They're all broke!

667
00:53:33,327 --> 00:53:35,761
- See you in Denver.
- I'm off to Denver too.

668
00:53:35,807 --> 00:53:38,685
- So am I!
- Nobody goes without orders from Kimball!

669
00:53:38,727 --> 00:53:40,319
- I'm leaving.
- You are not.

670
00:53:40,367 --> 00:53:43,439
You'll take no joyride
in this town with them painted hussies.

671
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:46,638
We've waited this long.
Another night won't hurt us.

672
00:53:46,687 --> 00:53:50,123
But if the money's not here
in the morning, out we go!

673
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:51,919
Get back to work!

674
00:53:51,967 --> 00:53:53,958
(Clicking)

675
00:53:55,727 --> 00:54:00,198
We're beat, Mr Kimball. Without the pay,
the gang will go to Junction City.

676
00:54:00,247 --> 00:54:02,044
- I know.
- Any word from Jeff?

677
00:54:02,087 --> 00:54:05,523
He's in Junction City.
Says the car held to the grade all the way.

678
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,637
He and his men will be after Whitey in...

679
00:54:07,687 --> 00:54:11,760
They will not! Tell him to stay
right where he is until further orders.

680
00:54:11,807 --> 00:54:13,798
Yes, sir.

681
00:55:13,967 --> 00:55:17,277
Wonder if he thinks that's private property.

682
00:55:18,767 --> 00:55:23,522
If he tries to divide that like he cuts up
the loot, there's gonna be shooting.

683
00:55:28,927 --> 00:55:32,397
- Your laundry?
- Sandwiches. Do you want one?

684
00:55:33,367 --> 00:55:35,358
No. Where did you get them?

685
00:55:36,287 --> 00:55:39,643
Junction City.
A girl in a restaurant gave them to me.

686
00:55:39,687 --> 00:55:41,996
- Was she pretty?
- Mm-hm.

687
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:46,484
- Think you could get me a date?
- She's not that kind of a girl.

688
00:55:51,367 --> 00:55:53,801
Any of you boys win enough to buy a drink?

689
00:55:53,847 --> 00:55:56,759
- You ain't got a drink.
- I got a drink.

690
00:55:56,807 --> 00:55:58,798
(Clamouring)

691
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:03,003
- I thought you was fresh out.
- I was till we made the hit.

692
00:56:03,047 --> 00:56:06,926
While you looked for the payroll
that wasn't there, I had important business.

693
00:56:06,967 --> 00:56:08,958
(Man) Come on, fill her up.

694
00:56:13,407 --> 00:56:15,523
Latigo ought to be running this bunch.

695
00:56:15,567 --> 00:56:17,637
We might not eat, but we'd sure drink.

696
00:56:17,687 --> 00:56:21,123
Ha ha! You're a funny man.
Why don't you laugh?

697
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:24,477
- Am I supposed to?
- Not if you're smart.

698
00:56:24,527 --> 00:56:27,360
- I think you're smart.
- And what else do you think?

699
00:56:27,407 --> 00:56:30,922
That you made a mistake.
She'll only bring you trouble and guns.

700
00:56:30,967 --> 00:56:33,242
Since when is $10,000 trouble?

701
00:56:33,287 --> 00:56:35,960
That's exactly what you're worth.

702
00:56:36,007 --> 00:56:38,362
You're very flattering.

703
00:56:38,407 --> 00:56:40,284
But I'm inclined to agree with you.

704
00:56:40,327 --> 00:56:43,922
Don't make a habit of it.
Latigo, I want a drink!

705
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:46,481
And you've got a few habits
I don't like either.

706
00:56:46,527 --> 00:56:48,518
Settle down. Do you see what she's up to?

707
00:56:48,567 --> 00:56:52,037
I can see you.
And what I see I don't like too good.

708
00:56:53,847 --> 00:56:57,078
- I guess you could use one.
- Thank you, no.

709
00:56:57,127 --> 00:57:01,439
- It's the best. I got it off your own bar.
- You drink it.

710
00:57:01,487 --> 00:57:05,321
Sorry, lady, I don't drink.
I'm studying to be a bartender.

711
00:57:14,487 --> 00:57:17,047
- Don't you drink?
- Not alone.

712
00:57:18,047 --> 00:57:20,083
Suppose I join you?

713
00:57:28,847 --> 00:57:31,680
- Do you mind?
- And if I do?

714
00:57:31,727 --> 00:57:36,596
Don't push it. For a little while you're
gonna need me and I'm gonna need you.

715
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:44,644
I watched you walk.
I could swear we've met before.

716
00:57:44,687 --> 00:57:46,723
Could you?

717
00:57:46,767 --> 00:57:50,726
Funny little things you do.
Like when you smile.

718
00:57:51,807 --> 00:57:56,756
Strange. I seem to recognise
all your mannerisms,

719
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,798
if you know what that means.

720
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:03,796
- I know what that means.
- Do you?

721
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:06,361
I'm supposed to fight Whitey over you.

722
00:58:07,087 --> 00:58:09,442
With a little luck we'd kill each other.

723
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:13,804
- It's an interesting thought.
- What's interesting?

724
00:58:13,847 --> 00:58:16,680
- She is.
- You're so right. (Laughs)

725
00:58:18,087 --> 00:58:22,239
I may not send you back. Not until
you've helped me spend the ten thousand.

726
00:58:22,287 --> 00:58:25,359
- You mind if we join the party?
- Yes!

727
00:58:26,007 --> 00:58:30,205
You shouldn't, cos if you guess wrong
you ain't gonna hang alone.

728
00:58:31,287 --> 00:58:33,278
You like another drink?

729
00:58:33,887 --> 00:58:37,800
- Thanks, I still have this one.
- Drink them both.

730
00:58:52,127 --> 00:58:54,322
Anybody want to start the dance?

731
00:58:55,327 --> 00:58:57,636
With only one girl?

732
00:59:03,607 --> 00:59:06,326
Get back to the bar where you belong.

733
00:59:11,527 --> 00:59:16,476
Let's all get back to the bar,
where we belong.

734
00:59:24,007 --> 00:59:26,805
- You almost got your wish.
- One of them.

735
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:29,884
- The other?
- To know your name.

736
00:59:29,927 --> 00:59:32,919
His name? He's the Utica Kid.

737
00:59:34,087 --> 00:59:37,557
I don't like it either.
My family used to call me Lee.

738
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:39,598
Why don't you?

739
00:59:44,687 --> 00:59:46,723
You're supposed to be outside.

740
01:00:08,007 --> 01:00:09,998
(Horse whinnies)

741
01:00:28,887 --> 01:00:30,878
Come out with your hands up.

742
01:00:34,767 --> 01:00:38,680
- What are you doing here?
- I want to see the Utica Kid.

743
01:00:38,727 --> 01:00:41,195
- Who are you?
- A friend of his.

744
01:00:41,887 --> 01:00:44,640
Funny thing,
he never told me about no girlfriend.

745
01:00:44,687 --> 01:00:47,247
(Charlie) Is there any reason
why he should?

746
01:00:47,967 --> 01:00:50,117
- What's your name?
- Charlie Drew.

747
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:54,240
And you can put that gun away.
Or do I look dangerous?

748
01:00:54,287 --> 01:00:56,118
Not exactly.

749
01:00:56,167 --> 01:00:58,158
(Charlie yelps)

750
01:01:06,207 --> 01:01:08,198
Give me that rope.

751
01:01:14,167 --> 01:01:17,239
- When'd you get here?
- Just before they rode in.

752
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:24,685
Utica pulled the job off right on schedule.

753
01:01:25,447 --> 01:01:28,917
I suppose you've known
it was going to happen for quite some time.

754
01:01:28,967 --> 01:01:32,596
No, I haven't.
Utica doesn't talk to me about jobs.

755
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,558
Not this kind.

756
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:38,520
- Did he ever have any other kind?
- He will have. Soon.

757
01:01:39,447 --> 01:01:41,563
Then why don't you hold out?

758
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:45,599
Why don't you keep away
till he stops being a thief?

759
01:01:45,647 --> 01:01:49,640
I told him that's what I'd do.
He just looked at me and smiled.

760
01:01:49,687 --> 01:01:51,757
He said, "I wonder if you can."

761
01:01:56,527 --> 01:01:59,724
Tonight he has his answer. You're here.

762
01:01:59,767 --> 01:02:02,076
Yes, but only to tell him that you're...

763
01:02:02,127 --> 01:02:05,039
Only to tell him I'm in town
and might come looking for him.

764
01:02:05,087 --> 01:02:08,238
I want to keep him alive.
I want to keep you alive.

765
01:02:08,287 --> 01:02:10,437
- You know what he can do with a gun.
- I know.

766
01:02:10,487 --> 01:02:14,765
- Well, then, why?
- Because of a little thing called self-respect.

767
01:02:14,807 --> 01:02:17,719
Maybe you wouldn't understand
anything about that.

768
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:22,682
For five years I've played that thing
for nickels and dimes thrown into a hat.

769
01:02:22,727 --> 01:02:26,242
For five years
the Utica Kid has been laughing.

770
01:02:26,287 --> 01:02:29,279
I may have been wrong, Charlie,

771
01:02:29,327 --> 01:02:32,399
but I'm not gonna make
the same mistake twice.

772
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:34,722
Grant...

773
01:02:34,767 --> 01:02:38,123
When you see him
will you tell him that I'm here?

774
01:02:59,367 --> 01:03:01,801
Leave it alone!

775
01:03:01,847 --> 01:03:04,998
So all she'll bring is trouble and guns, huh?

776
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:07,163
Did you bring the money with you?

777
01:03:07,967 --> 01:03:09,764
No.

778
01:03:11,047 --> 01:03:13,845
- How soon do we get it?
- I wouldn't know about that.

779
01:03:13,887 --> 01:03:17,596
You should! $10,000 is a lot of money.

780
01:03:17,647 --> 01:03:19,683
And that's what he wants for me.

781
01:03:21,167 --> 01:03:23,522
Well, I'd say he was selling out cheap.

782
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:26,923
Never mind what you'd say.
What did Kimball say?

783
01:03:29,407 --> 01:03:33,320
If you don't know about the money,
why did he send you?

784
01:03:33,367 --> 01:03:36,245
He didn't send me. I came on my own.

785
01:03:36,287 --> 01:03:38,084
Why?

786
01:03:38,887 --> 01:03:40,878
- Ask him.
- Well?

787
01:03:42,447 --> 01:03:44,756
I wouldn't know.

788
01:03:44,807 --> 01:03:47,401
Then again, maybe I would.

789
01:03:47,447 --> 01:03:49,881
You were right the first time.

790
01:03:51,047 --> 01:03:54,483
I can walk quiet at night
and I'm a pretty good gun.

791
01:03:54,527 --> 01:03:56,643
I'd like to join up with you.

792
01:03:57,407 --> 01:04:00,046
You see, when a man gets fired
off the railroad,

793
01:04:00,087 --> 01:04:02,885
he has a little trouble finding a job.

794
01:04:02,927 --> 01:04:05,999
And when he can't find a job,
he gets hungry.

795
01:04:06,047 --> 01:04:09,278
I've been hungry for the last five years.
Haven't I?

796
01:04:10,007 --> 01:04:13,317
- (Whitey) How would he know?
- I'm his brother.

797
01:04:14,087 --> 01:04:17,363
- His brother?
- His younger brother.

798
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:21,085
Five years ago
he was a troubleshooter for Kimball.

799
01:04:21,127 --> 01:04:23,163
I lifted the feed herd and he came after me.

800
01:04:23,207 --> 01:04:24,959
Then gave you a horse to get away.

801
01:04:25,007 --> 01:04:27,726
But not until I'd heard all about
good and evil.

802
01:04:28,527 --> 01:04:31,724
I didn't buy what he had to sell then.
I'm not buying it now.

803
01:04:31,767 --> 01:04:34,645
- (Whitey) So you don't want him in, huh?
- No.

804
01:04:35,367 --> 01:04:38,359
Funny thing. I want him in.

805
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:41,763
- Any objections?
- It ain't that simple, Whitey.

806
01:04:41,807 --> 01:04:44,446
There's a personal deal
between me and him.

807
01:04:44,487 --> 01:04:47,240
- About what?
- He got in my way.

808
01:04:48,207 --> 01:04:50,198
That's right.

809
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:54,923
Oh, yeah, I remember you.
You're the man that fights kids.

810
01:04:54,967 --> 01:04:56,764
Which way do you want it?

811
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:03,842
Get up, come on, get up!

812
01:05:12,407 --> 01:05:14,318
Now one of you give him his gun.

813
01:05:34,407 --> 01:05:37,717
All right, Harbin,
you're the boss around here. You call it.

814
01:05:39,247 --> 01:05:41,238
I might just do that.

815
01:05:50,167 --> 01:05:52,556
Well, I ain't gonna take him alone.

816
01:05:55,527 --> 01:05:58,087
Then maybe you'd better move along.

817
01:06:20,127 --> 01:06:23,119
Any further objections?

818
01:06:24,607 --> 01:06:27,360
- Yeah.
- (Whitey) Now ain't that wonderful?

819
01:06:29,447 --> 01:06:34,043
- I'd be happy to call it.
- You may get the chance.

820
01:06:34,087 --> 01:06:37,602
You mind if the Utica Kid
and me have a little talk?

821
01:06:40,367 --> 01:06:43,006
Not at all. Call me when you're ready.

822
01:06:53,407 --> 01:06:56,604
I think you ought to know
I'm working for the railroad again.

823
01:06:56,647 --> 01:06:59,002
I figured as much.

824
01:06:59,047 --> 01:07:02,722
- Troubleshooter?
- Tonight I was carrying the payroll.

825
01:07:04,327 --> 01:07:07,046
- Where did you hide it?
- I gave it to the boy.

826
01:07:07,087 --> 01:07:09,078
It's in that shoe box.

827
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:12,118
(Laughs)

828
01:07:13,327 --> 01:07:16,637
Now all you have to do
is go in and tell Whitey.

829
01:07:16,687 --> 01:07:18,678
You're gambling I won't?

830
01:07:19,567 --> 01:07:23,560
- Same old story of good and evil.
- Same old story.

831
01:07:23,607 --> 01:07:25,598
You lose, Grant.

832
01:07:26,687 --> 01:07:29,520
Yeah, I kind of figured that
when you laughed.

833
01:07:30,527 --> 01:07:32,961
I'll give you the same break you gave me.

834
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:35,999
Ten-minute start,
then I tell Whitey I sent you away.

835
01:07:36,047 --> 01:07:39,164
I go, that money goes with me.
So does Kimball's wife.

836
01:07:39,207 --> 01:07:41,960
- No.
- Wait a minute, Lee. Hear me out on this.

837
01:07:42,007 --> 01:07:44,601
If I leave here, that boy goes with me too.

838
01:07:45,647 --> 01:07:49,276
Joey? Why do you want him?

839
01:07:50,527 --> 01:07:52,836
Maybe for the good of his soul.

840
01:07:52,887 --> 01:07:56,562
It's been a long time
since you heard that word, hasn't it?

841
01:07:56,607 --> 01:08:00,839
Mother and Dad used to bring it up
once in a while when we were kids.

842
01:08:01,927 --> 01:08:04,122
You were just about Joey's age.

843
01:08:05,407 --> 01:08:07,841
He thinks a lot of you, doesn't he?

844
01:08:07,887 --> 01:08:12,642
- He wants to grow up to be just like you.
- He may make it, with practice.

845
01:08:12,687 --> 01:08:16,077
Soon he'll be holding the horses
while you and Whitey hit a bank.

846
01:08:16,127 --> 01:08:20,518
There's another kid lying in the barn.
He got the start that way too, huh?

847
01:08:20,567 --> 01:08:23,604
- You didn't kill Howdy?
- I didn't hurt him.

848
01:08:23,647 --> 01:08:27,401
- And you're not going to hurt Joey.
- How could I do that?

849
01:08:27,447 --> 01:08:29,642
It's not hard.

850
01:08:29,687 --> 01:08:33,396
It's not hard. Not when he takes your road.

851
01:08:34,367 --> 01:08:36,403
Or haven't you stopped to look at it?

852
01:08:36,447 --> 01:08:39,166
Why bother? I picked it, I'll ride it.

853
01:08:39,207 --> 01:08:42,483
Lee, I'm asking you again.
Give Joey a chance.

854
01:08:42,527 --> 01:08:44,324
No.

855
01:08:52,207 --> 01:08:54,437
You've got ten minutes.

856
01:08:55,327 --> 01:08:57,204
I won't need them.

857
01:08:58,927 --> 01:09:01,157
Charlie's in there waiting for you.

858
01:09:01,207 --> 01:09:05,200
Think about her.
She's been following you for five years too.

859
01:09:05,247 --> 01:09:07,556
She's got a reason.

860
01:09:07,607 --> 01:09:10,075
Or didn't I tell you I'm gonna marry her?

861
01:09:33,047 --> 01:09:34,924
How much of that did you hear?

862
01:09:34,967 --> 01:09:36,958
Just what I wanted to hear.

863
01:09:37,007 --> 01:09:39,601
That you're gonna marry me. When?

864
01:09:40,607 --> 01:09:43,405
We're gonna have a lot of money, Charlie.

865
01:09:43,447 --> 01:09:45,438
$10,000.

866
01:09:45,487 --> 01:09:48,797
You can have pretty new dresses
and pretty new shoes.

867
01:09:48,847 --> 01:09:50,838
And a brand-new husband.

868
01:09:51,607 --> 01:09:55,316
- Tomorrow.
- No. Right now!

869
01:09:55,367 --> 01:09:58,040
If you want me, take me away right now.

870
01:09:58,087 --> 01:10:00,078
Please, please take me.

871
01:10:01,047 --> 01:10:02,958
Why the sudden hurry?

872
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:06,397
Has my big brother been telling you
the story of good and evil?

873
01:10:06,447 --> 01:10:08,677
Don't laugh at him.

874
01:10:08,727 --> 01:10:11,321
Why not? Why mustn't I laugh at him?

875
01:10:12,287 --> 01:10:14,801
Maybe it would be better if...

876
01:10:14,847 --> 01:10:17,361
if you tried to be a little more like him.

877
01:10:18,327 --> 01:10:20,887
Now isn't that just great?

878
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:22,838
Now I get it from you!

879
01:10:23,647 --> 01:10:27,117
Ever since I was a kid
that's all I can remember.

880
01:10:27,167 --> 01:10:31,843
"Why don't you be more like your brother?
Why can't you be more like Grant?"

881
01:10:31,887 --> 01:10:34,765
I don't want to be like him.
I don't want any part of him.

882
01:10:34,807 --> 01:10:36,843
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it's true!

883
01:10:36,887 --> 01:10:40,038
You don't know
what it's like to be the kid brother.

884
01:10:40,087 --> 01:10:43,045
Everything you do is wrong.
Everything you try.

885
01:10:43,087 --> 01:10:45,123
Until one day I tried a gun.

886
01:10:45,167 --> 01:10:47,635
Fit my hand real good.

887
01:10:47,687 --> 01:10:50,155
And I wasn't the kid brother any more.

888
01:10:50,887 --> 01:10:54,402
It's a good gun. It's gonna get us
everything we always wanted.

889
01:10:54,447 --> 01:10:57,678
But I don't want it. Not that way.

890
01:10:58,727 --> 01:11:00,718
Why must you steal?

891
01:11:00,767 --> 01:11:03,042
Because I like to steal.

892
01:11:03,087 --> 01:11:06,966
I like to see what people will do
when I take it away from them.

893
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:10,363
What happens
when something is taken away from you?

894
01:11:11,607 --> 01:11:14,485
Nobody's gonna take
anything away from me.

895
01:11:18,287 --> 01:11:20,721
Charlie, I'm asking you to marry me.

896
01:11:22,527 --> 01:11:25,644
No. Grant was right. You'll never change.

897
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:33,397
And he calls me a thief?

898
01:11:50,167 --> 01:11:51,964
Joey.

899
01:11:54,927 --> 01:11:56,918
Go on.

900
01:12:09,207 --> 01:12:11,198
Play some more.

901
01:12:13,167 --> 01:12:15,556
It's been a long time
since I heard an accordion.

902
01:12:15,607 --> 01:12:19,361
Any tune in particular? Or would this do?

903
01:12:19,407 --> 01:12:21,762
(? You Can't Get Far Without A Railroad)

904
01:12:32,407 --> 01:12:35,956
? Oh, you can't get far without a railroad

905
01:12:36,007 --> 01:12:39,238
? You can't get far without a railroad

906
01:12:39,287 --> 01:12:42,518
? You gotta have an engine
and you gotta have a track

907
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:46,606
? Oh, you can't get far without a railroad

908
01:12:47,727 --> 01:12:51,163
? There are tracks across the prairie

909
01:12:51,207 --> 01:12:55,041
? Where the buzzard builds his nest

910
01:12:55,087 --> 01:12:58,124
? There are tracks across the Rockies

911
01:12:58,167 --> 01:13:00,840
? To the Golden West?

912
01:13:00,887 --> 01:13:03,117
How does it go from there?

913
01:13:07,887 --> 01:13:10,401
How does it go from there, Lee?

914
01:13:10,447 --> 01:13:12,722
Everybody will be neighbours

915
01:13:12,767 --> 01:13:14,758
In this little dream of mine

916
01:13:15,967 --> 01:13:18,117
Take you clear across the country

917
01:13:19,367 --> 01:13:21,437
On the Bullfrog Line

918
01:13:22,527 --> 01:13:26,236
? Oh, you can't get far without a railroad

919
01:13:26,287 --> 01:13:29,723
- ? You can't get far without a railroad?
- Gentlemen!

920
01:13:29,767 --> 01:13:32,565
- Renner!
- Didn't you know he was working for me?

921
01:13:32,607 --> 01:13:36,122
- I've come for my thousand dollars.
- What thousand dollars?

922
01:13:36,167 --> 01:13:38,078
Your memory is quite short.

923
01:13:38,127 --> 01:13:41,005
I supplied you with information
about a certain boxcar.

924
01:13:41,047 --> 01:13:44,437
I was prepared to supply you
with information about the payroll.

925
01:13:44,487 --> 01:13:47,001
- Concho did not keep the appointment.
- So?

926
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:49,880
So ten per cent of the payroll is mine.

927
01:13:49,927 --> 01:13:52,760
Sorry to disappoint you
but we missed the payroll.

928
01:13:52,807 --> 01:13:55,082
Missed the payroll?

929
01:13:56,247 --> 01:13:59,045
In that case
I'm prepared to make a better deal.

930
01:13:59,087 --> 01:14:01,885
For $2,000,
I can tell you where the money is.

931
01:14:03,287 --> 01:14:05,437
You made a deal.

932
01:14:05,487 --> 01:14:08,240
Ben Kimball hired a man to carry it.

933
01:14:08,287 --> 01:14:13,441
I might never have located this place
if I hadn't heard that man's accordion.

934
01:14:14,647 --> 01:14:17,002
He has the money. Ask him!

935
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:27,316
Joey! Come here, Joey!

936
01:14:34,487 --> 01:14:36,398
(Verna) Grant!

937
01:14:41,367 --> 01:14:43,961
(Whitey) McLaine,
there's a woman with you!

938
01:14:44,007 --> 01:14:47,397
- That's right.
- Send her out before we come get you.

939
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:12,437
Here, hurry! Come on, Charlie.

940
01:15:39,367 --> 01:15:42,245
He's in the clear. He's riding away.

941
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:44,517
Yeah, he's riding. After me.

942
01:16:40,247 --> 01:16:44,081
- (Man) What are we stopping for?
- We're going to the mill, the short way.

943
01:17:37,687 --> 01:17:39,678
Get down to the mill!

944
01:17:47,807 --> 01:17:49,798
Come on! Take cover!

945
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:07,964
Here.

946
01:18:08,967 --> 01:18:11,925
There's a mine shaft
at the end of these cables.

947
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:14,561
It runs clear through the mountains.

948
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:18,202
On the other side,
about half a mile, is the railroad!

949
01:18:18,247 --> 01:18:20,238
It's two hours to the end of track.

950
01:18:20,287 --> 01:18:22,881
I have to send you out one at a time.

951
01:18:22,927 --> 01:18:24,838
Come on, Verna.

952
01:18:25,647 --> 01:18:30,243
- Tell Ben he'll get his payroll somehow.
- I'll tell him more than that.

953
01:19:03,567 --> 01:19:07,196
You'll get that money even if
you had to kill your own brother?

954
01:19:07,247 --> 01:19:12,446
The next ore bucket that comes down,
pull it around and jump in. I'll cover for you.

955
01:19:20,967 --> 01:19:23,401
It's clear, Charlie. Get out!

956
01:19:38,287 --> 01:19:40,960
See if you can reach him from over there.

957
01:19:45,847 --> 01:19:48,122
He can't stand them off, not alone.

958
01:19:51,167 --> 01:19:53,237
You figuring to help?

959
01:20:06,447 --> 01:20:08,085
Grant! Look out!

960
01:20:17,927 --> 01:20:19,963
He's real good.

961
01:20:20,687 --> 01:20:22,882
Only one better gun in Colorado.

962
01:20:25,047 --> 01:20:27,038
Charlie! Get over here!

963
01:20:30,127 --> 01:20:33,961
- I thought I told you to get out.
- I'm staying right here.

964
01:20:36,687 --> 01:20:41,636
All right. Now you get back inside
and I'll cover for you.

965
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:45,277
Thanks, Charlie.

966
01:21:27,887 --> 01:21:29,605
Lee, not the kid!

967
01:21:43,807 --> 01:21:47,197
You take care of the kid.
I'll see if I can keep them pinned down.

968
01:21:47,247 --> 01:21:50,762
Would you mind if I play big brother
just this one time?

969
01:22:20,847 --> 01:22:22,917
- Shoots high.
- You or the gun?

970
01:22:33,327 --> 01:22:35,636
- Joey all right?
- He's all right.

971
01:22:35,687 --> 01:22:39,600
That makes you a winner. Go ahead
and make a sucker out of the kid.

972
01:22:39,647 --> 01:22:43,401
Tell him all about good and evil.
Put him to work on the railroad.

973
01:22:43,447 --> 01:22:47,679
Things get tough, he can always play
the accordion for nickels and dimes.

974
01:22:47,727 --> 01:22:50,116
Sounds like old times, Lee. Welcome home.

975
01:22:50,927 --> 01:22:52,918
Don't give me that big brother grin.

976
01:22:55,687 --> 01:22:57,678
- Up there!
- Get him!

977
01:23:08,167 --> 01:23:10,397
(Clicks)

978
01:23:10,447 --> 01:23:13,439
I count mine. There's one left.

979
01:23:19,847 --> 01:23:21,838
He hit you hard, Lee.

980
01:23:21,887 --> 01:23:25,596
Not half as hard as you did
with that Bullfrog Line.

981
01:23:25,647 --> 01:23:29,242
That was Dad's favourite tune
and you know it.

982
01:23:29,287 --> 01:23:31,278
I know it.

983
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:34,637
You and your stinking accordion!

984
01:23:42,727 --> 01:23:44,718
Charlie.

985
01:23:45,767 --> 01:23:47,758
Charlie?

986
01:23:52,487 --> 01:23:54,159
You and Joey get the horses.

987
01:23:55,687 --> 01:23:57,598
What...?

988
01:23:57,647 --> 01:23:59,763
I'll take care of my brother.

989
01:24:53,847 --> 01:24:55,838
(Train whistle)

990
01:25:08,727 --> 01:25:11,321
Here's your money. Pay 'em off, Tim.

991
01:25:13,967 --> 01:25:15,958
Thank you, Grant.

992
01:25:18,567 --> 01:25:21,161
Looks like you won yourself a job. Mine.

993
01:25:22,127 --> 01:25:25,483
No, it won't fit.
Not nearly as well as your coat.

994
01:25:25,527 --> 01:25:27,643
Want your old job back?

995
01:25:29,527 --> 01:25:31,518
Thanks.

996
01:25:34,487 --> 01:25:37,877
All right, Joey.
Get a bucket and start carrying water.

997
01:25:37,927 --> 01:25:39,918
We're at end of track. Now go on.

998
01:25:50,247 --> 01:25:54,525
 Sometimes I feel like I could jump
over the moon

999
01:25:54,567 --> 01:25:58,276
And tell the sky above

1000
01:25:58,327 --> 01:26:01,399
 Does it matter how full the moon

1001
01:26:01,447 --> 01:26:05,918
 When you've an empty heart

1002
01:26:05,967 --> 01:26:08,925
 Follow the river

1003
01:26:08,967 --> 01:26:12,846
 Wherever you may be

1004
01:26:12,887 --> 01:26:20,123
 Follow the river back to me

1005
01:26:20,167 --> 01:26:27,562
 Follow the river back to me?
