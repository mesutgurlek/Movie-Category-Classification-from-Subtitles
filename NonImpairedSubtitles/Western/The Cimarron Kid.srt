00:11:56,195 --> 00:12:00,097
Why, l was ranching
out in California and doing
good for myself, too.

156
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,633
Suddenly this railroad
dick rides up

157
00:12:01,701 --> 00:12:04,363
and accuses me
of being leader
in a train holdup.

158
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:06,928
Why, l had to break
jail to get here.

159
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:09,338
Which goes to prove
something, Kid.

160
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,378
lf Red Buck there
hadn't popped his mouth
off in the train,

161
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:13,878
you wouldn't be
in this fix now.

162
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:16,107
All right, Moore,
all right.

163
00:12:16,382 --> 00:12:19,249
l already said l was sorry.
What do you want me to do?
Keep on saying it?

164
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:22,715
Oh, Red's a tough hombre
in the clinches, all right,

No, only the Daltons
are clever.

The brain kids.
Think fast all the time.

169
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:36,263
That's right, Red.
You never said nothing
truer in all your life.

170
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:38,428
Why, even our little brother,
Will, there, is smarter than
you,

171
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:40,096
and he hasn't joined up

has anybody ever heard
of the name Red Buck?

175
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,023
Maybe they will
after tomorrow.

176
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:05,730
Oh, you ain't going on
the Coffeyville raid.

177

Since when?

Since now.

How come?

180
00:13:11,871 --> 00:13:14,465
Well, it's like l said, Red,
you don't think very fast.

181
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,441
You're tough,
but you don't think
fast enough.

182
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:20,301
Anything else?

183
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:25,079
Yeah. You don't shoot
so good, neither.

Hey, Dynamite!

Red'll be the boss
at lndependence.

You take your orders
from him.

Does he tell me how
to blow up a county

Oh, l don't think so,
Red.

and get away fast.

We're all of us heading
back here, ain't we?

00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:05,416
Well, we're not expecting
any trouble, but if we do,

212

why, we figure
they'll throw out
a big net for us.

And Bob was sort
of figuring...
l kind of figured that...

214
00:15:09,655 --> 00:15:11,179
Well, they'd be
expecting us to
head for here,

00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:12,690
so why don't we
cross them up?

We'll go straight to
Pat Roberts' cow ranch.

Yeah, well, maybe
Pat Roberts don't
like us anymore.

l understand he's turned
honest in a big way.

Oh, Pat's all right.
Don't you worry about him.

he'll help us out.

think you could
rustle us up a couple
of covered wagons?

Sure can.
Clothes for six of us,

231
00:16:00,406 --> 00:16:02,101
make us look like
emigrants on the trail?

Gotcha.
All right.

233

Then you meet us
outside Ouachita.

234

You know the spot
in the Cherokee Strip.

235

Sure do.

236
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:11,779

some medicines, too,
just in case.

This job calls for
six of us.

Oh, no.
He's too ambitious.

245

He wants to make
a reputation all
on his own in a hurry.

them James boys
ever dreamed up.

Two banks at the same time.

253
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:01,764
After this one,
l'm going far away.

l was ever an outlaw,

and no fear of somebody
taking a potshot at me

259
00:17:14,747 --> 00:17:16,908
just to get a reputation
for himself.

260

Yes, sir, after this one,
l'm taking myself right off
to Argentina.

got the real picture
of Coffeyville yet.

262
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,558
This is really something.

263
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:29,787
Something me and Bob
has timed and timed.

264
00:17:29,862 --> 00:17:31,454
Here's the way
she's gonna go, Kid.

265
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,896
We'll pull
out of here tonight
as soon as it gets dark.

266
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:37,367
At 8:00 in the morning,
we'll be in the outskirts
of Coffeyville.

267
00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:39,370
Bob's timed our entrance
to the very second.

268
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:42,532
Now, we split up
and enter town from
the opposite directions,

269
00:17:42,608 --> 00:17:46,271
passing each other
on the main street
at exactly 8:45.

we're riding your horses.

the Coffeyville Bank.

You tie up across
from the Union Bank.

275

The bank opens for business
at 9:00 sharp.

they gets there at 8:45.

8:50 exactly, just as
regular as clockwork.

and walk in quietly.

All right, walk over
to the corner. Move!

Open up that safe.

that's impossible.

Hi, Kid.
Hello, Stacey.

Why didn't you
say something?

What'd you want me
to do, Bill?

330
00:24:22,207 --> 00:24:24,937
Stay in Coffeyville
and get it bandaged?

331

Rose, you sure you
don't want me to...
No, Stacey.

Hang on, honey.

Not a sign or smell of them,
despite all these reports.

335
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,767
Everybody's hunting
for them here

336
00:25:29,842 --> 00:25:33,573
around the Five Nations
lndian Territory,
down near lngalls.

337
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:35,874
Well, maybe the Daltons
figured it that way

338
00:25:35,948 --> 00:25:38,439
and decided to cross us up
around here.

339
00:25:38,517 --> 00:25:42,920
Let's see, they moved
south from Kansas
up here, and west,

340
00:25:44,423 --> 00:25:45,981
that's sparsely settled
country there,

341
00:25:46,058 --> 00:25:47,787
just a few ranchers.

342
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:51,722
Hey, l know one or two
cattlemen there.

343
00:25:53,165 --> 00:25:56,032
One of them might be
interesting to talk to.

344
00:25:56,101 --> 00:25:57,864
l'll go with you, Marshal.

345
00:25:59,872 --> 00:26:02,272
At least
my lndependence deal
worked out all right.

346
00:26:02,341 --> 00:26:03,968
We got the cash.

347
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,175
All right.

348
00:26:06,245 --> 00:26:09,612
So now we're gonna go
right back to Coffeyville
and stick up them two banks.

349
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:10,943
This time, if the citizens
give us any trouble,

350
00:26:11,016 --> 00:26:12,745
we're gonna shoot up
the whole town.

Don't you tell me.

Coffeyville thing again for
all the gold in Kansas.

No.

356
00:26:30,969 --> 00:26:33,164
Well, then, l think you'd
better give us a reason.

unnecessary killing.

unnecessary killings!

(CHUCKLlNG) Well, now,
ain't that too bad?

360
00:26:42,214 --> 00:26:45,945
And there'd be plenty
of it on both sides
if we went back there.

Bill's right.

363
00:26:57,396 --> 00:26:59,626
lf we went back there,
they'd shoot us to pieces!

364
00:27:12,744 --> 00:27:14,609
l'm agreeing
with the Kid.

365

Well, Red, speaking as
an innocent bystander,

369

l'd say you've
been overruled.

370

All right.

371
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:39,902
All right! Maybe we should
just throw away our guns
altogether.

372
00:27:39,972 --> 00:27:43,408
Maybe we should
just forget that
the law is chasing us.

373

Well, let me
tell you something.

From now on,
l'm making all the rules.

375
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:52,245
l got a rule of my own
it might do you good
to remember.

376
00:27:52,317 --> 00:27:55,718
There'll be no killing
unless it's forced on us.

377
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:03,591

be one of them times,
like l said.

Although he's riding
the wrong horse now,

430

keep on that way.

You won't be bothered
with us anymore, Pat.

00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,895
But this is too dangerous.
l know.

461
00:33:13,972 --> 00:33:16,463
lt's a bad life
and a bad way to live.

462
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:18,403
But l go with you.

463
00:33:27,886 --> 00:33:29,547
Can l talk to you?

464
00:33:29,754 --> 00:33:30,880
Sure.

465
00:33:31,256 --> 00:33:32,746
Straight talk?

466
00:33:32,957 --> 00:33:34,049
Yeah.

467
00:33:34,893 --> 00:33:37,521

don't like a woman
who preaches to him,

00:33:37,595 --> 00:33:40,996
tells him what to do
and how to run
his life and all that.

469
00:33:41,066 --> 00:33:45,127
But l listened to what you
said inside the house and
it made sense.

470
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:47,395
About gunplay
and all that.

471
00:33:49,174 --> 00:33:51,165
Why don't you
give it up?

472
00:33:51,609 --> 00:33:53,702
lt's too late
for that now.

473
00:33:54,012 --> 00:33:57,004
What do you think
you're gonna get
out of all this?

474
00:33:57,082 --> 00:33:58,276
Money.

475
00:33:59,484 --> 00:34:01,179
To spend on yourself?

476
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,511
For gambling?
For a girl?

477
00:34:04,923 --> 00:34:06,686
None of them things.

00:34:06,758 --> 00:34:07,747
What, then?

Land.

480
00:34:09,461 --> 00:34:11,656
Land? Where?

481
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:18,062
A place far away.

482
00:34:19,471 --> 00:34:23,202
l once heard a fellow
talking about a place
called Argentina.

483
00:34:24,376 --> 00:34:26,503
He said with the proper
amount of money,

484
00:34:26,578 --> 00:34:28,808
you could build yourself
a big cattle ranch there.

485
00:34:30,181 --> 00:34:31,671
He also said,

486
00:34:32,884 --> 00:34:36,149
you might even figure to
start yourself a new life.

487

but she won't, because
she's in love,

490

and all the time they're
heading straight to death
on a dark road.

You, too. You're
on that same road!

about the Kid's operations.

00:36:54,158 --> 00:36:56,490

He circles wide.

01:18:36,425 --> 01:18:38,985
Still an awful long way
to Argentina.

1083
01:18:39,294 --> 01:18:41,922
We'll get there, Bill,
l know we will.

1084
01:18:43,732 --> 01:18:46,963
l've been building our ranch
all the way here, Carrie.

1085
01:18:47,036 --> 01:18:49,869
Mile by mile
and log by log.

1086
01:18:51,006 --> 01:18:54,100
l've been building
corrals, fences,

1087
01:18:55,677 --> 01:18:57,474
stocking the range.

1088
01:18:58,881 --> 01:19:02,578
You're gonna have
all the things you
always wanted, Carrie.

1089
01:19:04,887 --> 01:19:06,787
Just like real people.

1090
01:20:05,013 --> 01:20:07,481
He wouldn't stand
a chance, honey.

1091
01:20:07,549 --> 01:20:10,916
They'd catch him
before he got halfway
to the border.

1092
01:20:11,019 --> 01:20:13,419
What are we
really gonna do, Dad?

1093
01:20:13,856 --> 01:20:15,346
l don't know.

1094
01:20:17,826 --> 01:20:20,659
l'll get him some clothes
and clean him up.

1095
01:21:07,376 --> 01:21:08,900
Kiss me, Bill.

1096
01:21:18,987 --> 01:21:20,978
SUTTON: Don't move, Bill.

1097
01:21:34,069 --> 01:21:35,798
Let's see your hands.

1098
01:21:45,647 --> 01:21:47,638
Well, Bill,
it's been a long chase.

1099
01:21:47,716 --> 01:21:49,650
Kind of hate to see it
end this way, Kid.

1100
01:21:49,718 --> 01:21:52,243
l mean, with you
still in one piece.

1101
01:21:53,021 --> 01:21:54,886
lt ain't ended yet,
Mr. Swanson.

1102
01:21:54,957 --> 01:21:55,981
l'll be back.

1103
01:21:56,058 --> 01:21:58,083
That's right, Bill,
you will be back.

1104
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:00,253
Could l talk to him
a minute, Marshal?

1105
01:22:00,329 --> 01:22:01,318
Alone.

1106
01:22:01,396 --> 01:22:02,693
We got nothing to say.

1107
01:22:02,764 --> 01:22:04,595
l think you do, Bill.

1108
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:06,567
Get his gun.

1109
01:22:25,587 --> 01:22:27,748
Oh, listen to me, Bill.

1110
01:22:27,823 --> 01:22:30,485
This isn't the end,
it's the beginning.

1111
01:22:30,559 --> 01:22:34,086
lt's the only possible way
we can have anything ever.

1112
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:39,727
Come on, John,
let's go.

1113
01:22:49,911 --> 01:22:52,277
Well, Pat, guess you
saved yourself a horse
on the deal.

1114
01:22:52,347 --> 01:22:54,907
lt's gonna be
as tough on her
as it is on you, son.

1115
01:22:54,983 --> 01:22:56,780
She really loves you.

1116
01:22:56,852 --> 01:22:58,342
lt won't be too long.

1117
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:01,583
When you come back,
this ranch will belong
to you two kids.

1118
01:23:02,391 --> 01:23:05,383
Now why don't you go over
and say good-bye
the way you should?

1119
01:23:15,103 --> 01:23:16,968
l guess Pat's right,
Carrie.

1120
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:18,404
So are you.

1121
01:23:18,707 --> 01:23:20,504
How many mistakes
can a man make

1122
01:23:20,575 --> 01:23:22,236
and still hope
to get away with?

1123
01:23:22,311 --> 01:23:23,403
Oh, Bill.

1124
01:23:38,627 --> 01:23:40,424
You're lucky, Carrie.

1125
01:23:41,096 --> 01:23:44,361
l wish that
Bitter Creek and l had
that same chance.
