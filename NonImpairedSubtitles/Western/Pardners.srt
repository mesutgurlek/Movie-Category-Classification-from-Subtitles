1
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,878
You got five minutes, Kingsley.

2
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,434
You coming out
or are we coming in after you?

3
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,398
- Sam Hollis.
- I know.

4
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,755
Come out! Wade, come out here!

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,959
- There's no room for your kind.
- Don't try to be a hero, Wade.

6
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,233
We'll let you live.

7
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,874
Looks like Hollis means business.

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,036
I think he's out to get you this time,
Wade.

9
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,720
I know, Slim, but I ain't a-scared none.

10
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,631
- There's only 12 of them out there.
- And remember, can't be no shooting.

11
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,158
We got to think of our wives and kids.

12
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,952
- Sally!
- Coming, Slim.

13
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,549
They're back again, huh?
What are you going to do?

14
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,750
We're gonna fight! Matilda!

15
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,436
- Where are you going, Matilda?
- Back to New York.

16
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,154
- And I'm taking little Wade with me.
- Excuse me, Sally.

17
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,510
You can't walk out on Big Wade now.
He's in trouble.

18
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,473
It's not my fault. Father was right.
I never should have come West.

19
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,556
You're savages, all of you.

20
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,830
They killed your brother, Wade.

21
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,432
Your father, Carol.

22
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,508
And they'll kill you, too.

23
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,868
Well, I'm bringing my son up in the city

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,513
where he can learn
to live like a gentleman!

25
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,392
Are you coming with us?

26
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,876
A man has got to stay and fight
for his land.

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,673
Well, little Wade and I
don't have to stay.

28
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,719
Kiss him goodbye
and bring him here to me.

29
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,270
- Will you be here?
- I'll be here.

30
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,436
- Matilda.
- Goodbye, little Wade!

31
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,478
You got five minutes, Kingsley!

32
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,353
You coming out
or are we coming in after you?

33
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,439
- I'll get little Slim.
- Yeah.

34
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,754
And put a slow fire under the supper.

35
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,519
- I think we're gonna be a little late.
- Please be careful, both of you.

36
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,154
Don't worry about us.
Worry about them.

37
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,429
Hurry along, Slim, time's a wasting.

38
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,671
Your time is up, Kingsley!

39
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,751
- Ready, Wade?
- All set, Slim.

40
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,279
Let's go. Wade!

41
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,398
- Cover me.
- I got you.

42
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,068
I warned you both to get off this land,
Kingsley.

43
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,792
This land belongs to him!

44
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,797
Let's string 'em up, men.

45
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,197
Let's get 'em, pardner!

46
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,958
I'm with you, Slim!

47
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,958
Wade! He really hit me, Wade.

48
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,509
Slim!

49
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,628
Hollis, you skunk.
You ain't getting away, Hollis!

50
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,557
You ain't getting away.

51
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,074
You're through, Hollis. Get up.

52
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,515
- I said get up!
- Yeah. Yeah, I will.

53
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,678
I know your kind.

54
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,554
Without a gang behind you,
you're nothing.

55
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,159
You're a coward!

56
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,394
And I ain't afraid of no coward.
I spurn you, and I turn my back on you.

57
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,475
Slim!

58
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,713
Over here, Wade.

59
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,029
- What happened?
- I think he got me.

60
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,593
So long, pardner.

61
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,833
So long, pardner.

62
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,511
Don't worry, Slim,
some day our sons will avenge us.

63
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,233
Yeah. I'll see you up in that big pasture

64
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,599
with the whistling wind in the sky.

65
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,593
Jim, you're all
a panicky bunch of rabbits.

66
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,188
But today the market is very unstable.

67
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,478
Thank you, Mr Graham.
Thank you, Mr Baxter.

68
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,989
You're welcome, Master Wade.
Same time tomorrow?

69
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,519
Yes, thank you.

70
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,991
- Thank you, Mr Hawkins.
- Thank you, Master Wade.

71
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,230
I almost made it that time,
didn't I, Mr Hawkins?

72
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,475
Almost.

73
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,557
Mr Hawkins, did you tell Mother
that I wanted to have a word with her?

74
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,272
Yes, Master Wade. She's in conference.

75
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,755
- She's in conference.
- She said you're to wait in your room.

76
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,553
- She'll come in as soon as she's free.
- I see.

77
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,992
Mrs Kingsley, I must still advise you
to sell your shipping holdings

78
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,793
and put the money
into conservative bond issues.

79
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,354
That's exactly what I expected to hear
you say, Jim.

80
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,472
That's why you'll always be working
for a salary.

81
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,188
We'll have to continue with this
next Saturday, gentlemen.

82
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,392
I'm giving an engagement party
for my son tonight.

83
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,399
- Wade is getting married?
- Yes!

84
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,599
- Who is the lucky girl?
- Amanda Wentwon'th.

85
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,838
- Wentwon'th Consolidated.
- Exactly.

86
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,829
They can't move their products
without ships.

87
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,798
Wade must be very excited
about getting married.

88
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,672
I haven't told him yet.

89
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,872
All right. Are you ready, Mr Hawkins?

90
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,595
- All ready, sir.
- Fine. Then go!

91
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,878
- I got you that time, Mr Hawkins.
- Bravo, Master Wade, bravo.

92
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,275
- Wasrt that a good one?
- Very good, sir, very good.

93
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,915
- Good, Master Wade, good.
- All right, now don't move, Laura.

94
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,991
'Cause this is a very tricky one.

95
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,035
- I got you, you varmint.
- Oh, how dare you!

96
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,833
Get going, boy.
We're gonna make tracks, boy.

97
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,038
- Get me up!
- Oh, yes, Mrs Kingsley.

98
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,196
Of course, Mrs Kingsley.

99
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,197
Get going, get going, boy. It's thieves.

100
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,437
Move! They're closing in on us.
Get going.

101
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,597
Don't slow up now, boy.
They've got us completely surrounded.

102
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,988
Get going!

103
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,471
I'll give you one minute
to get out of that disgusting outfit.

104
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,069
- Yes, Mother.
- I want to talk to you.

105
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,959
Oh, I'm sorry!

106
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,039
You're a quitter.

107
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,155
I'm sorry I kept you waiting, Mother.

108
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,639
- Sit down.
- Yes, Mother.

109
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,558
Tomorrow's your birthday.
I shall be very sorry to lose you.

110
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,434
Lose me? I'm not gonna die.
Dr Meister said that my heart is fine.

111
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,959
Except occasionally
I do get a little high-strung.

112
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,911
- Oh, be quiet!
- I'm quiet.

113
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,912
It hasn't been easy bringing you up
without a father.

114
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,952
And may I say
your father didn't amount to much.

115
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,556
Wasrt there anything good at all
about my mother, Father?

116
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,715
I mean,
wasrt there anything good at all

117
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,829
about my father, Mother?

118
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,351
Nothing. He was a cowboy,
a rough, untutored cowboy.

119
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,878
- By the way, you're getting married.
- I am? Well, congratulations to me.

120
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,228
- Anyone I know?
- Of course!

121
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,998
What kind of a mother
do you think I am?

122
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,270
I think that you're probably
one of the sweetest mothers

123
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,595
that a boy has ever had, Mother.

124
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,116
No. What I mean to say is,
what is the girl's name, if I may ask?

125
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,355
Amanda.

126
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,791
- That tall, mean girl?
- She's strong.

127
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,069
That's exactly what you need.

128
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,191
I'm announcing the engagement
at dinner tonight.

129
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,595
- Now, just a minute, Mother.
- Yes?

130
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,473
Well, what I mean to say is,
that this is a big step for a man,

131
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,034
and you just don't plunge
into these things.

132
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,639
Well, there's just something
I have to know.

133
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,354
- What is it?
- What time is dinner?

134
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,596
The usual time
and see that you're not late.

135
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,835
No, I won't be late, Mother.

136
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,712
I try my very best
to be prompt at all times.

137
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,876
Amanda! She's 7'2".

138
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,639
She's taller than me,
and she's mean and big,

139
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,479
and I haven't got a chance
with such a girl.

140
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,956
- Hello, Hawkins.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Carol.

141
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,399
I have orders not to admit you.

142
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,398
But I must see my aunt, Hawkins.
It's terribly important.

143
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,795
- I'm afraid she won't see you.
- Well, tell her we're inside.

144
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,956
- She'll have to see us.
- We'll wait in the living room.

145
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,640
- We'll wait in the living room.
- You don't seem to understand.

146
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,035
Mrs Kingsley isn't going to like this.

147
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,869
Oh, dear.

148
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,476
Wow, this is a nice little barn.

149
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,194
You know, she's harder to see
than the President of the United States.

150
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,153
Well, Aunt Matilda's a little difficult.
You'll just have to charm her.

151
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,192
Oh, don't worry. I'll make an impression.

152
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,672
My antique chair!

153
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,993
- Well, I'm glad it was only an old one.
- Who are you?

154
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,994
Oh, well, this is Slim Moseley.
He's foreman of the K Ranch.

155
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,719
Howdy, ma'am.

156
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,314
Mrs Kingsley,
I believe you knew my father.

157
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,509
He worked for your husband.

158
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,029
- Yes. You're very like him.
- Well, thank you.

159
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,798
It wasrt intended as a compliment.

160
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,717
I don't think
my charm's getting through to her.

161
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,752
- What are you doing here?
- Well, we came for the rodeo.

162
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,952
Well, you see, ma'am, we're trying
to buy Cuddles, a champion bull,

163
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,435
and the K Ranch could build up
a fine-blooded line with him.

164
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,118
I fail to see how that affects me.

165
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,198
Well, Slim is gonna turn over
all his prize money.

166
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,197
But we'll still be a little short.

167
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,878
And Carol will lose the ranch
if you don't help her.

168
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,514
I'm not interested
in whether she keeps it or loses it.

169
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,551
Well, you should be.
Your husband died to save it.

170
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,954
- He was a fool.
- He was a hero.

171
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,911
- Nonsense.
- Well, he and my father were buddies.

172
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,316
- They died side by side.
- I don't want to hear about my husband.

173
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,993
What are you ashamed of?

174
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,111
The time that he and my father drove off
a pack of Indians

175
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,753
the night that Wade was born?

176
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,635
Or the time those three killers came
into town looking for him?

177
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,671
And you pleaded with him not to go.

178
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,995
And he said,
"Those killers are waiting for me."

179
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,874
Then he said goodbye to you.
He said goodbye to his little baby.

180
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,235
The baby cried and he patted it.

181
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,318
Then he opened the door
and walked down the street

182
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,509
to face those three killers.

183
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,108
And it was high noon,
ma'am, high noon.

184
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,630
The first killer was a giant, 6 feet tall,

185
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,156
squinty-eyes, no forehead.

186
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,349
The second was built like a gorilla,
a big gorilla.

187
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,789
The third one was a little man,
but mean.

188
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,912
A little, little man, very, very mean.

189
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,428
Then they met on the street,

190
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,596
and the three killers
started walking towards him.

191
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,359
Suddenly everybody started shooting
at once.

192
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,075
The first killer was shot in the chest.
The second killer was shot in the arm.

193
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,634
And the one who was shot in the arm
whipped out a gun from his hip,

194
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,909
and he started shooting at the shoulder.

195
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,029
And the one that was shot in the chest

196
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,149
reached for his shoulder holster,

197
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,269
and he shot with the shoulder holster.

198
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,197
The one that was shot in the arm,
he shot from the hip.

199
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,276
The one that was shooting from the hip,
shot with the shoulder,

200
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,391
then they whipped out two guns
and he shot 'em right in the heart,

201
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,590
bleeding blood, real red blood
they was bleeding.

202
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,154
And then he whipped around once,
he whipped around twice,

203
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,077
then he went back,
then he spun him around once,

204
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,269
and he spun him around twice,

205
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,799
and finally he looked up
and there he saw

206
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,639
the last killer coming towards him,
aiming.

207
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,752
He started to count,

208
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,478
one, two...

209
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,158
Three!

210
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,238
Oh, stop it! I've heard enough.

211
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,998
You haven't heard anything,
Mrs Kingsley.

212
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,758
The trouble is starting all over again.

213
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,155
There's a band of masked raiders
terrorizing the valley.

214
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,838
They're trying to drive
all the ranchers away.

215
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,155
That's the trouble with the K Ranch.
We lost a lot of stock.

216
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,511
Oh, please, Aunt Matilda,
if you'll help us this once,

217
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,710
I promise we'll never bother you again.

218
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,519
Hawkins, throw these people out!

219
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,474
Yes, ma'am.

220
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,679
You'll have to leave, sir.

221
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,199
Come on, Slim.

222
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,675
Thanks for being so neighbourly,
Mrs Kingsley.

223
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,519
It makes me appreciate
the killers out West.

224
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,278
Oh, my Ming vase!

225
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,353
Pick up a new one
and send me the bill, ma'am.

226
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,037
Hawkins, throw me out!

227
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,560
Will you look at them
trying to milk that wild cow!

228
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,038
Number 12 and 17 disqualified! No time!

229
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,435
Don't worry, Cuddles.
I'm still in first place.

230
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,471
We're going to take you home with us.

231
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,750
- You like my bull, eh, Slim?
- Sure do.

232
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,758
- I don't blame you.
- He'd be won'th a lot to the K Ranch.

233
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,110
Well, I hope
you can buy him from me, son.

234
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,549
The next team up
in the wild cow milking contest is

235
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,716
Number Two and Number Eight.

236
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,950
Slim Moseley and Killer Jones.

237
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,991
- That's me.
- Good luck.

238
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,156
There's not a man in the world that's
gonna stop me from winning this event.

239
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,556
I say, sir,
would you be good enough to tell me

240
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,796
where I could find Slim Moseley?
I mean...

241
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,433
Say, I don't like to disturb you, but I...

242
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,792
All right, cowboys, let's go!
Number Two and Number Eight!

243
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,956
Come on, Moseley,
you're holding up the show.

244
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,152
- I'm all set. Get Number Eight.
- Number Eight!

245
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,029
Number Eight, you have 60 seconds,

246
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,991
or according to the official rules,

247
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,873
you will both be disqualified
from the event.

248
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,390
I beg your pardon,
but I'm looking for Mr Moseley.

249
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,078
- You Eight?
- What?

250
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,872
- You Eight?
- Yes.

251
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,196
As a matter of fact,
I don't eat too much during the day.

252
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,275
Just a cookie and a glass of milk.

253
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,914
But I think it was the cookie with
the raisins that gave me the indigestion.

254
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,076
All right, hurry up.
Slim's waiting for you.

255
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,634
Oh, he is?
Fine. 'Cause I want to see him.

256
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,548
- He's out there!
- Oh, thank you very much.

257
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,798
People that just can't be neat.

258
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,558
Somebody's gonna trip
and hurt themselves.

259
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,671
Mr Moseley. Mr Moseley.

260
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,713
Hey, Mr Moseley, there was something
I wanted to talk to you about...

261
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,159
Let her go!

262
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,668
Disqualified! No time for Moseley.

263
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,030
Hey, Mr Moseley, you better be careful.
You're gonna get hurt.

264
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,354
And you were very careless back there.

265
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,799
- You dropped your rope.
- I did?

266
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,036
Oh, yeah, but don't worry,
I picked it up and tied it to the post.

267
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,310
- You tied it to the post?
- Yeah, you see, I thought that maybe...

268
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,589
Why, you!

269
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,555
If I get my hands on you, I'll...

270
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,917
Time's up and he made it!

271
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,833
Slim Moseley is up next.
Watch shoot Number Two.

272
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,598
Slim's riding Crazy Snake.

273
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,319
Let me have it!

274
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,238
Mr Moseley, can I talk to you a minute?

275
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,713
Get out of here, you'll get killed!

276
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,912
Well, I don't like to bother you,
but my mother's waiting and I got to go!

277
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,951
Will you get out of here?

278
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,319
Get out of here!

279
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,395
Here I go!

280
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,512
Moseley pulled leather!
He's disqualified.

281
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,039
Gee, that's too bad, Mr Moseley.

282
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,912
You should have held onto that horn
on the saddle.

283
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,632
I'll hold onto you!

284
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,349
And now we come to the last contestant
in our singing cowboy contest.

285
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,959
Get ready, Slim.

286
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,319
Now, we'll dim the lights down real low,
so we can all get in the mood

287
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,830
and hear a beautiful song of the range
from Slim Moseley.

288
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,112
The wind, the wind

289
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,918
The whistling wind

290
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,597
The wind

291
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,553
The wind

292
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,995
The whistling wind

293
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,357
A cowboy never rides alone

294
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,679
When the trail seems long

295
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,235
There's the friendly song

296
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,476
The song of the wind

297
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,311
The whistling wind

298
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,880
Where the wagon train
used to cross the plain

299
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,679
There's always the wind

300
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,677
The whistling wind

301
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,150
Whistling of the days of the long ago

302
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,759
Of the buffalo and the Navajo

303
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,829
Men like Daniel Boone
and the settlers too

304
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,756
And the West that grew

305
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,793
It's in the wind, all in the wind

306
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,559
The whistling wind

307
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,629
The whistling wind

308
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:51,232
When shadows pale along the trail

309
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,156
A cowboy never rides alone

310
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:04,153
'Cause he rides again
with the mighty men

311
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,589
Who ride in the wind

312
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,475
The whistling wind

313
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,798
When the shadows pale

314
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,276
On the long, long trail

315
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,553
There's always the wind

316
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,835
The whistling wind

317
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,069
The wind, the wind

318
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,391
The whistling wind

319
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,949
Ladies and gentlemen,
the judges have decided

320
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,471
that the winner of the singing cowboy
contest is Slim Moseley!

321
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,474
- Well, you did it.
- Here comes Cuddles.

322
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,196
The prize is
this beautiful silver loving cup.

323
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,793
There goes Cuddles.

324
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,674
Well, that's all the show, folks.
Thanks a lot. See you next year.

325
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,518
And adiós to you all.

326
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,073
Hi. I've been looking everywhere for you.

327
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,997
I'm not hard to find.
I'm in the loser's section.

328
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,031
Gee, it certainly was a big thrill
being your pardner.

329
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,434
Being my pardner?

330
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,154
On account of you, I lose the rodeo,
I lose Cuddles,

331
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,589
and my boss is gonna lose her ranch,
pardner.

332
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,597
I was only trying to help.

333
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,671
- Will you do me a favour?
- Yeah, sure. What is it?

334
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,392
- Don't help.
- What?

335
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,318
- Don't help. Now get out of here.
- No, I came here to see you.

336
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,919
- I'm Wade.
- Wade who?

337
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,429
- Wade Kingsley, Junior.
- You're sick.

338
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,914
- No, I'm all right.
- You're sick.

339
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,474
No, I'm well! I'm Wade Kingsley, Junior.
Look.

340
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,956
"All right, boys,
get on that posse and ride!"

341
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,033
Wade Kingsley, Junior.

342
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,879
That's what they mean
by a family skeleton, huh?

343
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,150
If your mother sent you here
on account of that broken chair,

344
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,474
- I told her I'd take care of it.
- Oh, no.

345
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,114
My mother doesn't even know I'm here.
I came here to see you myself.

346
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,356
I need help.
You gotta take me out West with you.

347
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,710
You wouldn't last 10 minutes out West.

348
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,751
If you don't take me tonight,
I'm not gonna last five.

349
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,950
- You've never seen Amanda.
- Amanda who?

350
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,036
- The girl I'm gonna marry.
- That's your hard luck.

351
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,149
I'm sorry, there's no chance.

352
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,713
No, wait a minute,
you got to take me with you.

353
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,478
Come on, your father
and my father were pardners.

354
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,158
They died together.

355
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,475
When I'm ready to die,
you can be my pardner.

356
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,910
Oh, we can be pardners.
Well, that's swell.

357
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,393
When I die?

358
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,278
Your friend sure had his heart set on
my bull Cuddles, didn't he?

359
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,674
- Oh, yeah.
- Too bad.

360
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,394
- All right, boys, get Cuddles in the truck.
- Oh, wait a second, sir.

361
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,636
It was really my fault
that Mr Moseley didn't win Cuddles,

362
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,433
- and, well, I'd like to buy her for him.
- "Her"?

363
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,959
Oh, sure. Her.

364
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,273
Well, you save your money for about
20 years, sonny, and come back

365
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,833
and we'll talk business.

366
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,190
No, well, how much does she cost?

367
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,313
"She" costs $7,500.

368
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,039
Oh, I thought she'd be expensive.

369
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,593
All right, you wait here,
I'll go get the money.

370
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,675
No. You want to come with me?

371
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,392
No, well, you don't have to,
you can trust me.

372
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,919
You fellas, don't load her
or don't take her,

373
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,758
because I'll go to the bank, I'll be...
You want...

374
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,633
You better wait here, but I'll be back.
Bye.

375
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,518
Boys, load Cuddles.

376
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,278
Thank you very much, Mrs Martin.

377
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,909
- Hello, Mr Hocker.
- Good afternoon, Mr Kingsley.

378
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,429
- May I help you?
- Yes, I'd be glad to sit there.

379
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,516
Thank you and I'd appreciate
your helping me, Mr Hocker.

380
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,074
I would like to close out
my account, please.

381
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,552
- But you have over $25,000.
- Yes, that's right.

382
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,114
I'm sorry, Mr Kingsley,

383
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,356
but we have standing orders
to get your mother's approval

384
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,072
of any withdrawals you make.

385
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,870
Well, let me just say this, Mr Hocker,
I think that if...

386
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,790
Murrayhill, 1098.

387
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,549
Mr Hocker, what I'm about to say is,

388
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,432
I think Mother will be awfully angry
if you call her.

389
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,595
She's very busy today.

390
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,995
As a matter of fact,
today's one of her busiest days.

391
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,470
- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs Kingsley.

392
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,070
I'm sorry to bother you.
Your son is here.

393
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,511
He wants to close out
his personal account.

394
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,232
What does he need all that money for?

395
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,477
I told you, you shouldn't have
bothered her today, Mr Hocker.

396
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,113
I'll put him on.

397
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,468
Thank you.

398
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,269
Hello, Mother dear.

399
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,914
Well, now, tell me what do you need
all that money for?

400
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,917
Well, it's a surprise, Mother.

401
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,110
Yes, yes, that's it,
I want to buy a surprise.

402
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,915
It isn't a wedding present for Amanda,
is it?

403
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,911
No, it's... Oh, yeah.

404
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,514
Oh, you hit it right on the head
that time, Mama.

405
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,154
Yes, it's a wedding present for Amanda.

406
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,588
How sweet.

407
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,034
Strange as it may seem, Mother dear,

408
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,673
this looks just like Amanda.

409
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,954
Well, here we are, Cuddles.
I'll bet Mr Moseley'll be glad to see us.

410
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,957
Come on in. Come on.

411
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,799
Be careful. Don't hurt yourself.
Come on, follow me.

412
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,798
That's a good bull, come on.
This is gonna be your house.

413
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,311
You'll sleep here and everything.
That's good, Cuddles. Come on.

414
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,677
Hey, wait a minute, Cuddles.
You belong in here, not me.

415
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,231
Hey, we're moving! Westward ho!

416
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,069
Cuddles!

417
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,633
Hello, there!

418
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,952
- I stepped on it.
- Oh, stop it.

419
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,909
- What are you doing here?
- I brought you Cuddles.

420
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,271
- I bought her for the K Ranch.
- That's wonderful! Thanks.

421
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,072
Oh, it's all right.

422
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,630
- No strings attached?
- Oh, no, no strings.

423
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,035
I just figured since it was my fault
that you lost her,

424
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,559
this is the least I could do.

425
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,389
- You know, I had you figured all wrong.
- Thanks a lot. It's nothing. Forget it.

426
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,635
- Oh, I won't forget it.
- Forget it.

427
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,875
- I won't forget it.
- Forget it.

428
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,069
- I won't forget it!
- Forget it!

429
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,155
I won't! Goodbye!

430
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,713
- You leaving?
- You're leaving.

431
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,159
You said
there were no strings attached.

432
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,111
- Yeah, but I only thought that...
- Well, don't thought.

433
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,276
I'm not taking you out West.

434
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,476
Okay, I'll go.
And you can keep Cuddles anyhow.

435
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,670
- Thanks and goodbye.
- Goodbye.

436
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,509
Help!

437
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,349
Oh, help, help!

438
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,754
I said goodbye, the trairs going.

439
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,075
- Help, help! Help!
- No, no!

440
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,156
Help!

441
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,791
Help! Help! Help!

442
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,230
Gee whiz. Thanks a lot.
You saved my life.

443
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,395
That's all right. Forget it.

444
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,112
- No, I won't forget it.
- Forget it.

445
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,753
- I won't forget it.
- I said forget it.

446
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,154
All right. I'll forget it.

447
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,396
- You do everything I say?
- Yeah.

448
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,909
- You get off at the next stop.
- Okay.

449
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,435
Easy, Cuddles. Nice, Cuddles.

450
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,316
You're a good boy, Cuddles.

451
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,990
- Slim, can I do something?
- Yeah, you can do something.

452
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,591
- Oh, water Cuddles.
- What?

453
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,439
- Water Cuddles.
- Oh. Oh, sure.

454
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,431
Here's your water, Cuddles.

455
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,513
- You moved. Should I try it again?
- Don't do nothing.

456
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,838
Just get out. Don't get off, just get out.

457
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,792
Like before I got off the train

458
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,515
and you had to save me
from getting killed when I fell out of it.

459
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,430
"Sincerely yours,
Wade Kingsley, Junior,

460
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,714
"your son."

461
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,719
Here, Cuddles.

462
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,952
Thank you, Cuddles.

463
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,515
The train is slowing down.

464
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,234
Yeah, we're switching over to let
the Eastbound Express have this track.

465
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,475
- You're in luck.
- I am?

466
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,477
Now you're gonna get off here.

467
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,275
- You really want me to go?
- No strings, first stop, remember?

468
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,718
- Yeah. All right.
- My coat.

469
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,915
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, thanks for the ride and everything.

470
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,998
That's all right.

471
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,114
Cuddles.

472
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,269
Goodbye.

473
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,594
Hey!

474
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,748
Hey, Cuddles, what are you doing here?

475
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,472
You're supposed to be on the train
with Mr Moseley.

476
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,238
He's not gonna like this one bit.
And here he is.

477
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,554
What are you doing with Cuddles?

478
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,113
We werert doing anything, Mr Moseley.

479
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,879
- We were just talking.
- Trying to sneak off with him, huh?

480
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,072
No. I'd have to be an awful big sneak,
and I'm not an Indian giver.

481
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,714
Cuddles is yours, Mr Moseley,
but when I came off the train,

482
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,068
I felt like someone was following me,

483
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,111
and sure enough,
when I turned around...

484
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,158
So long, kid!

485
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,677
Hey, wait! Wait a minute!

486
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,873
Now look what you've done.
We've missed the train.

487
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,989
I'm sorry.

488
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,599
Is that gonna get me back to the ranch?

489
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,032
Well, I tell you what we could do.

490
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,832
- We could first...
- There's no "we."

491
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,430
There's "me" and there's "you,"
and you, I don't want to see any more.

492
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,836
- Yeah, but I thought maybe even...
- Don't thought. It's over.

493
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,678
Goodbye and good luck.

494
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,475
Goodbye, Mr Moseley. Bye, Cuddles.

495
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,673
Bye, everybody.

496
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,716
"And Mother dear, I have the most
wonderful pardner in the world.

497
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,751
"He's what they mean
when they call someone a man.

498
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,077
"He's gonna teach me to ride
and to shoot and be like him.

499
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,668
"You probably
won't even recognise me."

500
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,240
You know, Cuddles, he thinks
I'm the greatest guy in the world,

501
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,999
and I didn't even give that kid a chance.

502
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,873
Come on, Cuddles.

503
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,357
- Good morning!
- You!

504
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,440
Yeah.
It must be pretty hot walking, huh?

505
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,153
Where did you get this outfit?

506
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,430
Oh, a man gave me a lift,
and I bought everything from him.

507
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,710
- He was quite surprised.
- I'll bet he was.

508
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,479
Yeah, I bought the car for you
and the trailer for Cuddles.

509
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,309
And I know you're angry with me,
but would you please let me drive you?

510
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,036
- It will be my pleasure, pardner.
- Well, it'll be my...

511
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,073
Pardner! You really...
You really mean it?

512
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,795
- Certainly. We'll give it a try.
- Oh, that's terrific.

513
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,470
- We'll be just like our dads.
- Just like our dads, yeah.

514
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,837
Here, have some lemonade.
I'll fix up the trailer.

515
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,389
Come on, Cuddles.

516
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,634
Well, this looks like a nice place
to pitch camp.

517
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,030
Yeah, this looks like a very nice place
to pitch camp.

518
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,149
Why?

519
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,032
Well, that's what you said, remember,
you just said...

520
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,673
It makes no difference what I say.
It's what you think.

521
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,358
- Do you like it here?
- I hate it.

522
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,675
- You hate it?
- I changed my mind.

523
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,153
- You see these trees?
- Yeah.

524
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,713
They're to keep the wind off of us.

525
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,909
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

526
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,316
- Oh, they're just like a tall blanket.
- They're like a tall blanket.

527
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,475
I'm gonna let Cuddles out.

528
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,034
I'm gonna haul some water,
then I'm gonna build a fire.

529
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,673
Oh, let me build the fire. I know how.

530
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,791
Would you let me make the fire?
I know how to make a fire.

531
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,638
Go ahead, make a fire.

532
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,355
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting some sticks for the fire.

533
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,550
Sticks? You got a whole forest there.

534
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,478
- Here, get some twigs over here.
- Oh, all right, I'll get twigs.

535
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,392
- I'll be right back.
- All right. Fine.

536
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,839
Come on, Cuddles.

537
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,835
And I'll get this fire started

538
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,558
while you're gone. He'll be right back?

539
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,398
Is that you, Slim?

540
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,995
Slim?

541
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,275
Moseley!

542
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,153
It's me, Wade.

543
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,116
You got no "yoo" on your "whoo."

544
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,909
- Slim?
- What?

545
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,314
Slim, I'm glad to see you. I missed you.

546
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,078
I was all alone here.
I didn't know where you went.

547
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,760
- You're looking swell.
- I've only been gone 20 seconds.

548
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,873
I'm sorry, but I was awful worried here
all by myself.

549
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,560
I'm trying to get the fire going here,
see?

550
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,039
Rubbing these sticks together.

551
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,071
Don't you think it would be better
with one stick?

552
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,235
- One stick?
- Yeah. Just one.

553
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,078
Well, I didn't know that...

554
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,352
Well, I really should have thought
of that myself. I'm sorry.

555
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,436
You really got your heart set
on being a cowboy, huh?

556
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,358
Oh, yeah, my heart's set on it,
but my stomach's a little shaky.

557
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,118
All right. Come on,
let's get the stuff out of the car.

558
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,437
I'll help you, Slim. Let me do it.
I'll get the stuff out of the car for you.

559
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,518
I'll have all the things that we need
right here.

560
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,438
You know,
you're gonna be all right, Wade.

561
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,629
- Really?
- Yeah.

562
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,796
You and I are gonna get along
together fine.

563
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,194
You mean we?

564
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,110
You and me

565
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,196
We're gonna be pardners

566
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,108
You and me, we're gonna be pals

567
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,950
You and me, we'll do and dare alike

568
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,119
We'll share what there's to share alike

569
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,633
That goes for money, whisky and gals

570
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,956
You and me
we'll be the greatest pardners

571
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,435
Buddies and pals

572
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,238
You and me, we're gonna be pardners

573
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,909
You and me, we're gonna be pals

574
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:14,875
You and me, when other friendships fail

575
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,153
We'll still be on that long, long trail

576
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,474
That leads up to those pearly corrals

577
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,991
Up in the sky

578
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,030
You and me
we'll be the greatest pardners

579
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,834
Buddies and pals

580
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,469
You and me
we'll be the greatest pardners

581
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,318
Buddies and pals

582
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,757
I'll teach you how to draw

583
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,919
Without a hitch or flaw
You'll draw just like your famous pa

584
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,712
- Who, me?
- Watch.

585
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,634
I got it.

586
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,633
Don't you think it'd be better with a gun?

587
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,077
Are we still pardners?

588
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,640
All right, we're still pardners.
Here, get the rope.

589
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,839
The fastest antelope

590
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,518
That sees you with a rope

591
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,517
Will know there just ain't any hope

592
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,198
- No hope at all.
- Come here.

593
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,639
Yeah.

594
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,318
- Give me room.
- Give me room. Room.

595
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,873
All right, grab the rope in the right hand.

596
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,638
- In the right hand, yeah.
- All right.

597
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,557
- And the rest in the left hand.
- The rest in the left hand.

598
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,795
- Spread your feet.
- Spread.

599
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,672
- All right, now, make a loop.
- Make a loop.

600
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,119
- Make a loose loop.
- A loose loop.

601
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,231
- Take it back slow.
- How do I take that back?

602
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,833
- Slow.
- Oh, slow.

603
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,757
Okay, go!

604
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,033
Hey, come here.

605
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,589
Did you ever ride a horse?

606
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,553
Well, my mother had an electric horse
that I used to ride all the time,

607
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,591
- but I never rode a real horse.
- Come here.

608
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,755
Yeah.

609
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,831
- There's a horse.
- Oh, hello, nice horse.

610
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,269
- It has hard skin, this horse.
- Yeah.

611
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,038
Put your hand here.

612
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,351
- All right, put your foot in my hand.
- Yeah.

613
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,629
Up we go!

614
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,677
You can't ride a horse.

615
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,832
You can't spin a rope.

616
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,153
It's a cinch you can't use guns.
You're impossible.

617
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,877
All right. Come on, let's bed down.

618
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,558
You and me

619
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,278
We'll be the greatest pardners

620
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,638
Buddies and pals

621
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,393
You and me

622
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,475
We'll be the greatest pardners

623
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,518
Buddies and pals

624
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,399
All right, let's get some sleep.
We'll try again in the morning.

625
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,193
Oh, thanks a lot. Here, I'll cover you up.

626
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,158
It's cold out here at night
in the open air.

627
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,397
This is Carson Valley.

628
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,435
And over here, that's the K Ranch.

629
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,873
Oh, the K Ranch.

630
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,874
I've been dreaming about that
ever since I was a little kid.

631
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,149
I can't wait to get there.

632
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,236
Look, I wouldn't be so anxious
if I were you.

633
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,395
What do you mean?

634
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,159
If the masked raiders ever find out
that your name is Kingsley,

635
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,716
- they'll string you up to the nearest post.
- They would?

636
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,910
Yeah, they would. I'll tell you what.

637
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,388
We'll call you Killer Jones.

638
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,829
I'll take a chance
they don't find out and kill you.

639
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,758
Oh, well, thanks a lot, Slim.
I certainly appreciate that.

640
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,519
And I sure enough like a guy
that's not afraid to take a chance.

641
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,758
- What was that?
- It must be the masked raiders.

642
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,672
The masked raiders?

643
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,113
- Maybe we can catch 'em.
- Yeah. I think I'll walk.

644
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,514
Hold tight.

645
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,230
We'll never catch 'em now, Killer.
Killer?

646
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,595
Slim!

647
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,868
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Relax, sweetheart.

648
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,433
Everything's gonna be all right.

649
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,312
- Any damage, Rio?
- I don't know.

650
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,998
I was just going out
to check the west fence.

651
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,680
Well, this is the first time
they've struck in broad daylight.

652
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,394
They must be desperate.
Did you get a good look at any of 'em?

653
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,557
Wish I had.
But they was all wearing masks.

654
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,072
There's gonna be a mass meeting
in town tomorrow.

655
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,589
Cuddles.

656
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,352
- How did you get him?
- You can thank Killer Jones for that.

657
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,596
Hey, look. Look what's in here.

658
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,873
Is the shooting over?

659
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,158
Yeah, the shooting's all over.
You can come out now, Killer.

660
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,395
Killer?

661
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,677
- Put Cuddles in the barn, huh, fellas?
- Sure, Slim.

662
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,915
Hello.

663
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,196
- You were at the rodeo.
- Yes, ma'am.

664
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,276
Looks like some deck's missing a joker.

665
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,676
So you're gun-shy, eh?
I'll bet you dance real pretty.

666
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,836
- No, I can't!
- All right, Rio!

667
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,714
All right, all right! No, no, no more.
I'm dancing, I'm dancing.

668
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,029
That's enough, Rio. That's enough.

669
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,276
Well, we're just having some fun.
What are you, his mother?

670
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,550
No, go ahead and check the west fence.

671
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,274
- You're the foreman. I just work here.
- That's right. I'm the foreman.

672
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,470
- Thanks for sticking up for me.
- That's okay.

673
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,160
- I'm awful sorry about what happened.
- Oh, that's all right.

674
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,953
I'm gonna have to learn
to take care of myself anyhow.

675
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:34,595
I told Killer that we might be able to use
an extra hand around here.

676
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,589
Well, I guess we can.

677
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,312
Oh, that's wonderful!
Thank you very much.

678
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,749
Here, you can have 'em both.
What I mean to say is, I'll work.

679
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,950
I'll do everything. You'll see.
You won't be sorry.

680
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,071
- Well, then good luck.
- Thank you, Miss Kingsley.

681
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,475
Oh, by the way,
may I just say one thing?

682
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,749
Sure.

683
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,990
You... You mustang! You...

684
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,594
- Moseley's back.
- You told me he wasrt due till tonight.

685
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,675
He wasrt.

686
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,552
He was supposed to come in
on the train.

687
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,908
He brought somebody with him.

688
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,838
- The law?
- No. Some joker called Killer Jones.

689
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,073
With Slim back,
you better lay low for a while.

690
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,315
We can't lay low.

691
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,590
The government needs this
whole valley for the new power dam.

692
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,994
It's either all or nothing.

693
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,078
If we don't get control of the K Ranch,
we're lost.

694
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,077
- How much time we got?
- One week.

695
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,315
Come on.

696
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,153
How about a piece of pie, honey?

697
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,313
- Some fresh coffee?
- No, thank... No, thank you.

698
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,518
Look, honey, a falling star. Here.
Make a wish.

699
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,508
- It wouldn't do any good.
- Oh, why don't you try?

700
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,988
All right.

701
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,638
I hope the bank believes in falling stars.

702
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,951
We don't need the bank
with a moon like that.

703
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,479
- No?
- No, look.

704
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,914
We don't need to swing in a hammock

705
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,316
We don't need the nightingale's tune

706
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,238
All we need to get going

707
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,591
Is me 'r you 'r the moon

708
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,828
We don't need a heavenly setting

709
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,157
We don't need a sleepy lagoon

710
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,318
All we need to get going

711
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,716
Is me 'r you 'r the moon

712
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,836
Just the three of us

713
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,318
What a situation

714
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,989
Just the three of us, plus

715
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,391
A natural inclination

716
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,308
Oh, we don't need a flowery season

717
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,638
Love is love December or June

718
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:52,591
We can make our own weather

719
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,598
Just put us together

720
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,953
Me 'r you 'r the moon

721
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,995
We don't need a comfortable parlour

722
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,073
We don't need a phonograph tune

723
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,313
All we need to get goir is

724
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,318
Me 'r you 'r the moon

725
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,156
We don't need a horse and a buggy

726
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,278
Buggy rides are over too soon

727
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,437
All we need to get goir is

728
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,279
Me 'r you 'r the moon

729
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,789
Just the three of us

730
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,878
What a pleasure this is

731
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,751
Just the three of us, plus

732
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,151
A couple of thousand kisses

733
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,556
We don't need a flowery season

734
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,480
Love is love December or June

735
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:53,717
We can make our own weather
Just put us together

736
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,239
Me 'r you 'r the moon

737
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:04,954
Me, you and the moon

738
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,509
Come in.

739
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,675
- Oh, good morning, Miss Kingsley.
- Good morning.

740
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,834
- Slim told me all about you.
- He did?

741
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,470
- So you're Cousin Wade, huh?
- Oh, that. Oh, yes, ma'am.

742
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,352
But I wouldn't like for it to get around.

743
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,120
- Don't worry. I'll keep your secret.
- Thank you very much.

744
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,437
And you're welcome to stay on here
as long as you like, Cousin.

745
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,390
Thank you very much.
It's nice here, and you're wonderful.

746
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,548
- Oh, it's all right, we're cousins.
- You're not kissing cousins.

747
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,238
- No.
- Come on, we'd better get going.

748
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,918
I got to get to the town meeting
when it starts.

749
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,393
- Are all the boys going?
- Yes.

750
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,353
- Me, too?
- Certainly. You're one of the boys now.

751
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,469
Oh, boy.

752
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,636
And I better get you a gun,
because we may have a little trouble.

753
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,117
- I think I better take my nap now.
- Here's a gun that belonged to your dad.

754
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,471
It has "Wade" right on it.

755
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,513
- For me?
- For you.

756
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,313
Oh, thank you.

757
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,792
- I'll wear this gun proudly for you, Dad.
- Okay.

758
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,436
I'll make you proud you got a son,
Wade, Junior, Dad.

759
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,076
Well, come along, boy,
the meeting's starting.

760
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,713
Come along, Cousin.

761
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,712
Are you coming, Slim?

762
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:33,909
Wow!

763
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,553
Come on, Killer!

764
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,632
All right, let's go.

765
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,358
Whoa, whoa, now. Nice...
Oh, boy. Good boy.

766
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,710
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

767
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,953
Wait up! Here, nice horse!

768
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,038
Wait, wait, horse. Come here.
You got to wait for me, horse.

769
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,393
Well, now that you know
who the master is,

770
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,829
I don't suppose
we'll need this any longer.

771
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,630
Help! Help! Horse! Horse!
Runaway! Runaway! Help!

772
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,991
I'll see you in town. Come on, Buck.

773
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,350
- Need any help, honey?
- Why don't you stick to your cows?

774
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,071
Now, that's where you're making
a mistake. I'm not just a cowhand.

775
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,350
- I'm gonna be rich.
- Well, good.

776
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,710
You can buy yourself a new personality.

777
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,758
- Help!
- It's a runaway!

778
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,233
Stop 'em! Stop 'em!

779
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,399
Help! Help!

780
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,639
Help! Help!

781
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,910
Help! Help!

782
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,593
Stop! Help! Help!

783
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,950
Help! Stop!

784
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,117
- Help! Help!
- Help! Whoa!

785
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,874
Help! Help!

786
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,835
Stop them! Stop them!

787
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,710
- Stop them! Stop them!
- Gee, you drive awful fast for a girl.

788
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,798
- I think I'll get off at the next corner.
- I can't stop them!

789
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,071
You can't? I think I'll get off right here.

790
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,517
I stopped them. I stopped them!

791
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,074
Nice horsie! Oh, I'm a hero!
Look at me, everybody!

792
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,953
I stopped them all by myself!
I stopped them.

793
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,232
It's all right. You can wake up now.
I stopped the horses.

794
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,158
- Everything is fine now.
- It's all over?

795
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,309
Oh, yeah, I stopped the horses.

796
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,829
I just had to show 'em
who the boss was.

797
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,632
You're the bravest man I've ever known.

798
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,398
It wasrt anything.

799
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,992
- But you could have been killed!
- Yeah, I know.

800
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,754
- Thank you.
- We'd better get back to town.

801
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,393
Yeah, I guess so.

802
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,434
Giddyap!

803
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,749
Quiet!

804
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,918
Now, men, most of you
have already had trouble.

805
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,714
Your homes have been burnt
and your stock's been run off.

806
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,070
We need a new sheriff.
Let's get a good one.

807
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,760
We can't afford to wait any longer.
We must act now.

808
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,395
- What have we got a sheriff for?
- The sheriff can't do it alone.

809
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,919
He needs us behind him.

810
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,629
It's election time again.
They just killed the new sheriff.

811
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,030
- Mr Hollis, could you...
- I probably have more to lose

812
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,118
because of the masked raiders
than any man in this room.

813
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,629
I've been a banker in this community
for a good many years.

814
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:50,073
If these raids keep up,
my bank is going to be ruined.

815
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,834
Now, we need a sheriff who's not afraid
of these blood-thirsty killers.

816
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,359
- Well, I wouldn't...
- Someone who'll stand up

817
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,879
- to these cutthroats.
- Well, I'd like to...

818
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,629
I'm not finished yet, Slim.
A man who is fearless and unafraid.

819
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,318
- Well, I'm not...
- There must be one among us

820
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,078
who is not afraid to die
for our community.

821
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,077
You're right, Mr Hollis!

822
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,989
Here he is!
I told you he'd bring her back safe!

823
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,794
Hold them horses!

824
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,275
Stranger, we're proud to welcome
you to town.

825
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,719
'Twarrt nothing.

826
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:17,594
- Are you all right, Dolly?
- Yes, fine. Just a little bit shaken up.

827
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,274
- He stopped the runaway.
- Aw, 'twarrt nothing.

828
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,038
We were all scared silly.

829
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,639
Come on,
we'll get you into a nice hot tub.

830
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,716
- You'll feel better.
- All right.

831
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,877
Goodbye. And thank you.

832
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,190
- Let's take him into the meeting.
- Oh, well, wait.

833
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,118
Oh, I'm sore. Wait, be careful.
Wait, wait, sore.

834
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,390
Will someone raise his hand?
Will someone raise his hand?

835
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,317
You should have seen him.
He stopped a runaway.

836
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,637
- Leaped right into the jaws of death!
- There's a volunteer!

837
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,193
Bravest man I ever seen.

838
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,470
- Yeah. He's one of our boys now.
- Nice work.

839
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,355
Welcome, stranger. What's your name?

840
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,436
- My name is Wade...
- Killer Jones.

841
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,630
- Killer Jones.
- I'm proud to know you.

842
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,359
Killer Jones?

843
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,879
Thank you very much.

844
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,797
Well, you're just the kind of man
we need.

845
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,275
- You don't mean him? You can't do that.
- Why not?

846
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,550
- Yeah, why not?
- He's a busy man.

847
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,717
- No, I'm not busy.
- They want to make you sheriff.

848
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,795
They do?

849
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,478
The town needs a man
with your courage, Killer.

850
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,113
- You don't want to be sheriff.
- Oh, yes, I do.

851
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,229
- You don't.
- I do.

852
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,509
- No, you don't!
- I do!

853
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,756
- You see, he wants the job.
- Yes, I do.

854
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,156
All in favour of Killer Jones for the
new sheriff of Carson Valley say "Aye."

855
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,395
Aye!

856
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,953
- Opposed, "Nay."
- Nay!

857
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,752
- Nay!
- You sore loser!

858
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,791
This is Tom's. No sense wasting it.

859
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,751
- What happened to Tom?
- He retired.

860
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,512
- Congratulations, Sheriff.
- Thank you very much.

861
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:43,077
Oh, there's a hole in this.
Tom wasrt very neat.

862
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,958
- Well, you want to congratulate me?
- No. I don't want to congratulate you.

863
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,196
Why, because you don't think
I know how to sheriff?

864
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,151
- That's right.
- Yeah. Well, I'll show you.

865
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:55,750
Good. Show me. Now that you're sheriff,
show me your first move.

866
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:56,869
Well,

867
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:02,794
the first thing I'm gonna do as sheriff
is make you my deputy sheriff.

868
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,399
You're fired.

869
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,515
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

870
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,153
Oh, yes, Miss Kingsley. Don't worry.

871
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,793
This won't interfere
with my work at the ranch.

872
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,353
- It won't?
- Well, no.

873
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,199
Because I can do all the little things
a sheriff is supposed to do,

874
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:21,074
like no double-parking horses
and no throwing paper in the streets,

875
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,758
in my spare time.

876
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,309
I didn't know it was this easy.

877
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,158
That's probably because
you've never been sheriff.

878
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,952
- No, I never was.
- That's the difference.

879
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,753
You see, son, you're talking to a sheriff!

880
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,520
I told you, you were fired!
Now go on, get going.

881
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:35,955
Slim!

882
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,155
Slim.

883
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,949
Boss, I got to hand it to you.

884
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,798
That's the dumbest sheriff
we've ever had.

885
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,239
I want to keep this one.

886
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,237
The others were too smart
and too dangerous.

887
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,078
As long as this idiot's sheriff,
we're safe.

888
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,315
That's for certain.

889
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,429
What about tonight?

890
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,312
Pass the word
we're hitting the K Ranch.

891
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,317
- Come on, I'll set 'em up.
- Right.

892
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,153
I don't think we can afford
any more men, Slim.

893
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,238
- Hi, Dolly.
- Hello, Dolly.

894
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:05,399
Who are you helloing, you two-bit,
blowhard, weak-headed jackass?

895
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,469
Come on, I want to dance with you.

896
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,075
- Which one of me?
- Any one of you.

897
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,950
Why'd you say
all those mean things to me over there?

898
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,230
Mean? Those were compliments.

899
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,552
If I ever told you
what I really think of you,

900
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,636
it would singe your hair off.

901
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,799
Then, what I don't understand is,
why did you want to dance with me?

902
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:35,197
Because I think I'm in love with you.
You idiot!

903
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,194
Why did you let them talk you
into becoming sheriff?

904
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,750
Is that all you're mad about?

905
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,069
Looks like your hen found herself
another rooster.

906
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,191
Get ready to see
some chicken fricassee.

907
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,030
- We'd better stop dancing.
- Why? I like it.

908
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,799
You better not talk to me any more.
Please run. He'll kill you.

909
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,310
Who... Oh, that's impossible.

910
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,353
I'm the sheriff.

911
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,149
Leave him alone, Rio.
He didn't mean any harm.

912
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,634
Who told you
you could dance with Dolly?

913
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,273
Since when do I have to answer
to anybody?

914
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,550
Do you realise I'm the sheriff?

915
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,872
Please, Rio, please!

916
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,593
Don't you know it ain't nice
to push ladies around?

917
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,398
You're not a lady.

918
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,559
It's too sharp.

919
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,516
- You pushed me.
- Yeah?

920
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,553
Well, I push you!

921
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,434
- I'll put a stop to this.
- Don't, Carol. He's the sheriff.

922
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,238
It won't help him.

923
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,316
You're right. He needs help.

924
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,829
Come on.

925
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:24,628
No, this isn't good. How's this side?
No, no, no. Wait, wait.

926
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,638
Okay. That's good. Okay, now!

927
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,514
I'm gonna kill you with these two hands.

928
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,074
Wait, couldn't we just talk
for one second?

929
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,957
- Where are you?
- Here I am.

930
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,799
It's Rio!

931
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,791
Pick him up
and bring him over to the bar.

932
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:32,955
Yeah.

933
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,192
Wade!

934
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,838
Wake up! Wake up, Wade!

935
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:47,828
Easy, easy! Wade, this is Slim!
I'm on your side.

936
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:51,672
- What happened? Where's Rio?
- You knocked him out.

937
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,357
- I did?
- Sure you did.

938
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,509
Well, I guess that'll learn him
not to tangle with the sheriff, huh?

939
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:02,872
That's right. Now, go in there
and take charge, Sheriff!

940
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,235
- I'm gonna kill him.
- You'll do no such thing.

941
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,395
I told you we need him.

942
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:11,669
You're not going to lay a finger on him.

943
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,189
- I can't let him get away with this!
- Don't worry!

944
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,118
When the time comes,
you can take care of him.

945
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:21,110
Anyone who touches him
answers to me. Is that clear?

946
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,595
- Yeah.
- All right.

947
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,233
Anything you say.

948
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,954
Why, you...

949
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,710
- I ought...
- Come here.

950
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:54,076
I believe you owe this young lady
an apology.

951
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,077
You behaved very badly, you know.

952
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,875
- It's all right, Killer. Forget it.
- But he wants to apologise, don't you?

953
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,150
Take off your hat. Take it off!

954
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,434
That's better. Now, say you're sorry.

955
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,398
- Sorry.
- I can't hear you.

956
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,033
- I'm sorry.
- Speak up, boy!

957
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,196
- I'm sorry!
- Don't you yell at me!

958
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:15,437
- Now, get down on one knee.
- Nobody talks to me like that!

959
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,630
I do, and make it both knees!

960
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,871
I'm sorry.

961
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,474
You don't look very good short.
Stand up.

962
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:29,509
You don't look very pretty tall, either.
Try it on one foot.

963
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,314
I'm sorry.

964
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:34,075
- The other foot.
- I'm sorry!

965
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,874
- Try it with both feet in air!
- That's impossible!

966
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,275
- You're not trying!
- I'm sorry!

967
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:43,632
There, that wasrt so hard, was it?
All you have to do is force yourself.

968
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:48,276
But there's something missing yet.
Lean on the table.

969
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:54,998
Put one hand on the table and lean.
And raise that foot!

970
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,712
I don't believe this.

971
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,435
That's very good. Now, dance!

972
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:06,389
Dance! Dance! Very good!

973
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:07,919
Very good! That was perfect.

974
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,554
Now, it's all a question
of good manners, isn't it?

975
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,069
Isn't it?

976
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,394
Yes, sir.

977
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,388
It's just a question of good manners.

978
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,878
Fine. Now take a walk. Wait a minute!

979
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,039
Take a walk
and take that walk backwards!

980
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,839
- Now we got a real sheriff.
- We sure have!

981
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,396
Come on, Sheriff, let's celebrate!
Come on, Dolly, have a drink.

982
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,390
How about making a speech, Sheriff?

983
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,317
Well, I wouldn't know what to talk about.

984
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:45,793
- Killer.
- Yeah?

985
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,711
Well, there's nothing wrong in that,
that's no crime.

986
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:56,195
And I ain't ashamed, neither.
Sure, I'm sweet on Dolly.

987
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:00,075
- Why?
- Oh, I don't know.

988
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,873
I reckon because she's a gal
and I'm a guy,

989
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:05,920
and, well,
there's a lot of things about Dolly I like.

990
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,913
She rides like a feather

991
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,996
She looks good in leather

992
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,793
Her horse is all that she thinks of

993
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:18,079
But she's my buckskin beauty
buckskin beauty

994
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,953
The only gal I'll ever love

995
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,592
- Love
- Love

996
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,874
She sure loves to battle
with a herd of cattle

997
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,151
And cactus is her favourite flower

998
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:36,114
But she's my buckskin beauty
buckskin beauty

999
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,879
A-blooming sweeter by the hour

1000
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,119
Hour

1001
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,077
Hour

1002
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,310
When she came to woo me

1003
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,158
She lassoed and threw me

1004
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,238
'Cause that was the lady's style

1005
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,478
And then she demanded

1006
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:57,151
That we both get branded
and walk right down the aisle

1007
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:01,630
But I hate to marry so I didn't tarry

1008
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:04,792
But I took off like a frightened dove

1009
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:08,629
But she's my buckskin beauty
buckskin beauty

1010
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,713
The only gal I'll ever love

1011
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:16,033
Goodbye, my buckskin beauty
buckskin beauty

1012
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,913
The only gal I'll ever love

1013
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,834
Love

1014
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,753
Love

1015
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:40,119
Slim, the masked raiders
are on their way to the K Ranch.

1016
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,793
The K Ranch?

1017
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,831
The masked raiders,
they're on their way to the K Ranch!

1018
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,109
Let's go.

1019
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,589
The masked raiders? The K Ranch?

1020
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,278
- You better get the sheriff.
- You're the sheriff.

1021
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,470
- I think it's time for my nap.
- Stop fooling around.

1022
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:53,794
We gotta get to the K Ranch!

1023
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,751
Well, I can't go anywhere
until you put me down.

1024
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:58,713
Come on, men, we need a posse!
Let's go! Quick!

1025
01:06:58,840 --> 01:06:59,989
This way.

1026
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,714
Slim.

1027
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,159
You'd better hurry up.

1028
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,713
We got to get out there.
They'll have every...

1029
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:08,149
- Come on, Sheriff, let's ride.
- Yeah.

1030
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:10,114
Come on, Buck.

1031
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,674
- Good luck, Sheriff.
- Thanks, Dolly.

1032
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:14,714
I'm riding.

1033
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,033
Come on, boy, ride 'em.

1034
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:03,668
Ride 'em!

1035
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:26,549
A masked raider! Geronimo!

1036
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:32,471
I got a masquerader!
I got... I caught a masquerader!

1037
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,795
I got one of them. I got one of them!

1038
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:37,673
I'll take him in. I'll bring him in to jail.

1039
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:40,638
I got him. I caught him. I got him!

1040
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:49,191
Stand back! I got a masked raider!
Here, right here! I got a masked...

1041
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:52,312
Carol! Carol! Carol!
I got a masked raider.

1042
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:54,237
I caught him myself. Right by the barn.

1043
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:56,954
He had a flame in his hand,
and he was burning up the whole place,

1044
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,913
but I walked behind him,
I stalked him and I held the gun on him,

1045
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:03,191
and I caught him myself!
All alone, I caught... Slim.

1046
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:06,872
Not you, Slim! Not my buddy and pal!

1047
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:10,357
My pardner, one of the masked raiders.
Shame on you.

1048
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,875
Shame, shame,
you criminal outlaw, you!

1049
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,519
You're gonna have to hand in
your badge.

1050
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:15,868
I hate to do this, but it's my duty.

1051
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,434
- Hand it in, boy. Hand it in.
- Why don't you stop it?

1052
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:19,788
I'm no masked raider.

1053
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,876
But I saw you with the fire.
That's why I...

1054
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,991
Sure did a good job here, didn't they?
Go get 'em!

1055
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,917
They cut the west fence
and stampeded the herd.

1056
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,632
- He was standing...
- Looks like they got clean away.

1057
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,751
We'll see if we can round up your cattle,
Miss Carol.

1058
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,279
I grabbed him
because he had the flame.

1059
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,958
- Thanks very much.
- The torch was burning and so what...

1060
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,911
Will you forget the torch
and clean up the porch?

1061
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,950
It's like a joke, "Forget the torch
and clean up the porch."

1062
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,832
But let me explain,
you see, if you didn't have the fire...

1063
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,076
- Clean up the porch!
- All right.

1064
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:46,874
- Hello, Slim.
- Hi.

1065
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,069
Hello, Carol.

1066
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,077
Well, welcome to what's left
of the K Ranch.

1067
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,349
Oh, we're not licked yet.

1068
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,755
If Mr Hollis will give an extension
on the note, we can...

1069
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,836
I usually discuss business
with the people concerned.

1070
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,757
What happens to Carol is my concern.

1071
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,359
- Well, I...
- Please, Slim.

1072
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:02,233
- Let me talk to Dan alone.
- Sure. Excuse me.

1073
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:08,313
- I'm very sorry about all this, Carol.
- Why did it have to happen now?

1074
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:11,473
You know, you need a man
to take care of this ranch for you.

1075
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,398
A husband. I'm very fond of you, Carol.

1076
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:19,033
I can offer a wife a great deal.
I'm asking you to marry me, Carol.

1077
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:23,673
Well, thank you, Dan. I'm flattered,
but I'm going to marry Slim.

1078
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:26,713
- Where will you and Slim live?
- Well, here, of course.

1079
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:30,469
- I intend to hold on to the ranch.
- Your note's due on Monday.

1080
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,355
My board of directors
want that note paid.

1081
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,516
I've stalled them off as long as I can.

1082
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,437
Now, I'm afraid
it's gonna have to be paid.

1083
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:40,393
But I can't raise $15,000 by Monday.

1084
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,880
Well, maybe
Slim can think of something.

1085
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,873
- Goodbye, Dan.
- Goodbye, Carol.

1086
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:19,033
- I'd like to see Mr Hollis, please.
- Just a minute. I'll call him.

1087
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:20,309
Thank you.

1088
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,034
They want me inside. I'll be right back.

1089
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,632
He wants to see you.

1090
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:31,551
- Well, what can I do for you, Sheriff?
- How are you, Mr Hollis?

1091
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:34,792
I would like to pay off the note
on the K Ranch.

1092
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,392
Now, where did you get
this kind of money?

1093
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:42,559
Well, it's mine. Let me explain.
I'm sure I can trust you.

1094
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:47,110
- I'm Wade Kingsley.
- Wade Kingsley?

1095
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:50,116
- Junior.
- Junior?

1096
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,314
Certainly. You remember.

1097
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:56,149
Your father and my father
werert very good friends, were they?

1098
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,111
- Oh, no, they werert.
- No.

1099
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,830
- But time heals all wounds, doesn't it?
- Yes.

1100
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,552
Well, there you are, Mr Hollis.

1101
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:05,797
There's the money,
and I will take the note, please.

1102
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:09,869
You keep this. I'll go and get the note
for you, Mr Kingsley.

1103
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,555
Junior?

1104
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,799
- Killer.
- Oh, Killer.

1105
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,313
Yeah.

1106
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:24,431
Get going.
You're going to rob this bank.

1107
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:25,595
What?

1108
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:28,837
Our sheriff is out there with $15,000
to pay off the note on the K Ranch.

1109
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,632
If we lose the K Ranch,
we lose our whole set-up.

1110
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,273
Right. So hurry.

1111
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,352
- And, Rio.
- Yeah?

1112
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,355
- Now you can take care of the sheriff.
- It'll be a pleasure.

1113
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,591
- They're getting the note for you.
- Thank you very much, Mr Hollis.

1114
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:47,994
Here you are.

1115
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,031
You keep it
while they're getting the note.

1116
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:51,673
That's good business.

1117
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:55,270
Well, it certainly is nice
dealing with someone you can trust.

1118
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,628
Thank you.

1119
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,918
- The masked raiders!
- Everybody, get down.

1120
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:23,188
Turn around
and keep your faces to the walls.

1121
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,720
Where is he? Where's the sheriff?

1122
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:29,749
Shut up!

1123
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,157
No peeking. Turn around.

1124
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:54,154
Don't worry, ma'am. It's me, the sheriff.

1125
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,475
- Where's the sheriff?
- He must have got away.

1126
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,068
- Here's the money.
- Hang onto this, Gus.

1127
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:03,998
- I'll guard it like it was my very own.
- All right, let's get out of here.

1128
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:18,076
It's me! But don't worry.
I'll be with them every minute.

1129
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:31,710
- What happened?
- The masked raiders held up my bank.

1130
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,593
- And the sheriff went with 'em.
- The sheriff?

1131
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,153
Come on, Buck.

1132
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,638
We lost them, boy.

1133
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,518
Turn around,
we have to take the money back!

1134
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,631
You're not paying attention!

1135
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,595
- Come on, Gus!
- We got out of there just in time.

1136
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,438
Yeah, they were sure throwing lead
at us.

1137
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:25,959
It was easier than I thought it'd be.

1138
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,195
You know what I'm gonna do
with my share?

1139
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,595
Come on, Gus, you got the dough.
Put it on the table.

1140
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,870
Let's split it up, huh?

1141
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,119
How do we split it up?

1142
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:38,676
- We got plenty this time.
- Yeah, I want my share right now.

1143
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,398
I do the counting.

1144
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,994
Where's your manners?
Take off that mask.

1145
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,795
- Oh, it's a little chilly in here.
- I said take off that mask.

1146
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,589
You wouldn't like it. I'm very ugly.

1147
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,638
- You! Killer Jones.
- Killer Jones!

1148
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,914
That was a pretty good holdup
we just pulled off, wasrt it?

1149
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,190
- So Gus got it, huh?
- Yes, he did. You see, he...

1150
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,992
Where do you want it?

1151
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,716
Well, couldn't we just talk quietly
for a moment?

1152
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,831
I said, where do you want it?

1153
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:10,239
Well, this would be a good place
right here.

1154
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:12,829
- Let me finish him off.
- All right.

1155
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,920
- Let's kill him now.
- Kill me? I didn't do anything.

1156
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:29,838
No? Look, put yourself in my place.

1157
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:31,355
No!

1158
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,554
- You go out to rob a bank...
- I do?

1159
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:37,399
- You're with your buddies.
- My pals.

1160
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,556
Right. You rush the bank.

1161
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,189
We ain't a-scared of anything?

1162
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,799
You get the money
and you get out of there.

1163
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,319
- They're trying to kill you.
- Help!

1164
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:46,635
You get on your horse
and you ride away.

1165
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:47,829
They'll never catch us now.

1166
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:50,235
Suddenly, you find
you've got a spy among you!

1167
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:51,475
A spy!

1168
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,631
The dirty rat!

1169
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:59,549
- Would you shoot him?
- Shooting is too good for him.

1170
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:01,278
What would you do?

1171
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:06,435
I'd tie that dirty rat in that chair
and I'd gag his mouth!

1172
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:09,233
Then I'd stick two sticks of dynamite,
each one in a back pocket,

1173
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:13,194
and I'd light one at a time,
and I'd wait to see him blow to bits.

1174
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,557
That's good enough for me.
Tie him to the chair, boys!

1175
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:19,636
Wait a minute. I'm not a dirty rat!
No, wait. No, wait.

1176
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,273
- Yes, you are.
- Oh, my leg.

1177
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:27,030
Easy, easy. Wait. Wait. All right.
I'm sitting.

1178
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:30,112
That's fine. The dynamite's in the box
with the powder.

1179
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,708
If you blow me up, I'll tell Miss Kingsley
and she'll be pretty mad,

1180
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,637
and you'll get fired
because she and I are friends.

1181
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,751
Shut up!

1182
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,072
Come on, hurry up.

1183
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:01,355
All right, who wants to go first?

1184
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,639
Take it easy, Killer!
You wanted to be sheriff. You're sheriff.

1185
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:09,873
All of you, drop your gun belts.
Move slow.

1186
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,072
Nobody's leaving!

1187
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,553
But you don't understand.
We got to get...

1188
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:17,716
Save it!
You'll do all your talking in town.

1189
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:20,149
- That'll be too late.
- I said save it. Get over there. Over.

1190
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,111
All of you! Get over!

1191
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,994
And to think Carol trusted you, Rio.

1192
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,512
You're a real one-man band.

1193
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,873
All right, you're safe, I'm here, Sheriff.

1194
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,633
Let's get out of here!
There's dynamite in his pockets!

1195
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,030
Dynamite in his pockets?
Let's get out of here!

1196
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:53,709
Come on!

1197
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,751
Wake up! Slim, there's...

1198
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:01,350
Slim! Slim, wake up! Wake up, Slim!

1199
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:04,839
Slim, wake up!

1200
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,519
Slim, Slim!

1201
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:10,798
Slim! Wait, wait.

1202
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,638
Wait, wait.

1203
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:20,035
- Slim! Slim!
- Where did...

1204
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:23,072
Slim, let's get out of here.
There's dynamite, it's gonna blow up.

1205
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:25,156
- There's what?
- There's dynamite. It's gonna blow up.

1206
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,236
- I'll see you.
- Take me with you!

1207
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,954
Take me with you! Hurry up! Hurry up!

1208
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:34,593
Slim! Cutting... Be careful. That's it.
That's it. Hurry. There's dynamite!

1209
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,514
Cut this.

1210
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:45,398
- This is gonna be a big one!
- What's gonna be?

1211
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,871
- Wade.
- Oh, is that where they were?

1212
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,309
Gimme these things! Get down!

1213
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,471
Run! Get behind the rock!

1214
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:01,958
- Boy, are we lucky.
- I should say so.

1215
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:05,117
And are you lucky that you didn't
get hurt when Hollis hit you!

1216
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,549
- Hollis?
- He's the one that hit you.

1217
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:09,991
- So, he's the leader of the gang.
- Yeah.

1218
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:11,792
- Come on, let's go.
- Where are we going?

1219
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,992
- We're gonna round 'em up.
- Without guns or horses?

1220
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,680
- I'll carry you.
- Oh, well, thank you. That'll be good.

1221
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,552
- Then I won't feel too bad.
- Comfortable?

1222
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:21,033
- Yeah.
- Get down and walk.

1223
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,832
You said you'd carry me!
That's why I got on you, 'cause you...

1224
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:24,640
We have been troubled
by masked raiders for some time,

1225
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:25,595
We have been troubled
by masked raiders for some time,

1226
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:28,917
not knowing who they were.
And we've all been fooled.

1227
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:31,708
I have proof that Slim Moseley
is head of the masked raiders.

1228
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:34,155
- And Killer Jones is his lieutenant.
- I don't believe it.

1229
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:36,999
- Neither do I.
- It was hard for me to believe, too.

1230
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,838
But why else do you think
they ran away?

1231
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,518
They knew I was on to 'em.

1232
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,552
Hurry up! We don't want to be late
for the meeting.

1233
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,477
- It's the sheriff and Slim.
- Let's get 'em.

1234
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,591
Let's make sure this time.
Let's ride 'em.

1235
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,278
Don't let 'em get away!

1236
01:20:56,240 --> 01:21:01,030
What are we gonna do now?
Hurry up. They're coming.

1237
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,877
Hurry up, Slim! Hurry up!

1238
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,992
Now, get up.

1239
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:19,752
You. Get up. Hold on.

1240
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:22,474
Get going. Get over there.
Get over there, all of you.

1241
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:24,910
- Get in there!
- Throw your guns out here.

1242
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,395
- You in there, Al?
- Here you are, Sheriff.

1243
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,557
- All right, fellas, where's Hollis?
- Where's Hollis?

1244
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,992
Hollis is over at the K Ranch.
He's electing a new sheriff.

1245
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:37,475
- He wouldn't dare!
- All right, get 'em in jail!

1246
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,433
- Inside! Get going.
- Get in! All right, in!

1247
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:44,678
Now, we have to elect a new sheriff,
someone we can trust. Like Rio here.

1248
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:49,078
- Rio? Fine!
- Someone we can trust! Rio?

1249
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,309
Well, look! It's Slim!

1250
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,233
- And the Killer!
- Hold it!

1251
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:01,079
Everybody, hands up!
Get over there, get on the wall!

1252
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,792
Everybody! Fast!

1253
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:11,919
- It's too quiet.
- It's too quiet.

1254
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,235
- Something's wrong.
- Something's wrong.

1255
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:15,873
- I'll go first.
- You go first.

1256
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,070
- You cover me.
- I'll cover you.

1257
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:21,231
- I'll take Hollis and you take Rio.
- You take Rio.

1258
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,715
- You take Rio!
- Yeah, I'll take Rio.

1259
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:29,074
Keep your hand on the gun.
If they make a move, let 'em have it.

1260
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:34,310
Wade, will you stop fooling around?
That gun might go off.

1261
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:35,755
Gun?

1262
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:40,711
Where'd you get two guns?
Let 'em have it, Wade! Wade!

1263
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,553
Drop your guns.

1264
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:46,429
- Where's the sheriff?
- I wish I knew!

1265
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:49,831
The sheriff must be close by.
Get him, Rio. Now, move!

1266
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:54,199
I've waited a long time for this.
This'll square everything!

1267
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,799
Drop it, Hollis!

1268
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,468
Just in the nick of time, huh, Slim?
Pretty good!

1269
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,989
Everybody stay where you are.
Don't move, Sheriff.

1270
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:03,599
Now, give me that gun.

1271
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:10,910
All right, Rio, get up! On your feet.

1272
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:15,278
- Up! I've suspected you for a long time.
- Get over there with your buddy!

1273
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,231
There's the leader
of the masked raiders, Mr Hollis.

1274
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,510
All right, take 'em down to the
hoosegow with the rest of the gang.

1275
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:21,312
- Let's go, Rio.
- Come on, Hollis, let's go.

1276
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,271
Oh, Slim, I'm so proud of you.

1277
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,470
I'm so proud I'm busting my buttons.

1278
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,593
They're pardners, they're pardners

1279
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,913
They're pardners, pardners, pardners
buddies and pals

1280
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:38,430
You and me, we're gonna be pardners

1281
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:39,879
Slim and Wade

1282
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,712
They're gonna be pals

1283
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,068
Wade and Slim

1284
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,714
They'll do and dare alike

1285
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:48,752
They'll share what there's to share alike

1286
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:53,112
That goes for money, whisky and gals

1287
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:03,433
You and me
we'll be the greatest pardners

1288
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:07,156
Buddies and pals

1289
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:10,671
We're not ready for "The End" yet.

1290
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,076
We have something to say to you.
Right, Dean?

1291
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:18,838
We sure do, Jer.
We want you folks to know

1292
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,154
we sure enjoyed working for you,

1293
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:21,269
and we hope you enjoyed the picture.

1294
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:22,799
Yeah, and we hope you'll keep coming
to see us,

1295
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:25,115
- because we like seeing you.
- So long.

1296
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:28,437
Goodbye. Now, "The End." Not that way!

1297
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,839
That's better!

1298
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:36,434
You and me
we'll be the greatest pardners

1299
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:41,634
Buddies and pals
