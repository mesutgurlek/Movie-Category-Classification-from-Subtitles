1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:04,299
Meet the baddest man
on Bad Man's River.

2
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,749
When did you put that in?

3
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,523
Right after the last
King Gang holdup.

4
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:06,025
It's fire proof, burglary proof...

5
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,084
and only I know the combination.

6
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,393
Might turning around, please.

7
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,808
Come on in and have a look.

8
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,391
Solid.

9
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,595
Solid.

10
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,664
Solid!

11
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,943
Boys, drop your guns.
Come on.

12
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,522
Angel, get them.

13
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:53,825
And one, two, three,
one, two, three...

14
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,399
You are hopeless!
King?

15
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,841
Watch.

16
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,470
Beautiful.

17
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,673
Excuse me gentlemen, but
we're coming at the Omaha.

18
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:57,363
Odie, here's your share.

19
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,165
You have to get off here?

20
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,134
My childhood's sweetheart
is waiting.

21
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:06,172
- And she's been waiting for a long time!
- So you better hurry up.

22
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,140
Odie!

23
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,876
Where you're going,
you won't need this.

24
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,217
Kansas City.

25
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:21,220
Why don't you come with me to Chicago.
I have got big plans.

26
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,023
I have got little ones,
a house full of little ones.

27
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,025
I think I'll maybe
marry with her now.

28
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,227
You're gonna blow all
of that on one woman?

29
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,787
Her name is Annie.
She was made in heaven.

30
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,961
You look worried.

31
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,566
I once knew an Annie in Kansas City.

32
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,672
"Anytime Annie."

33
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,986
We got to stick together, old pal.

34
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,254
Come on!

35
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,192
Look at that.

36
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,360
Come on!

37
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:18,132
Oh, forgive me. I thought
this was the dining car.

38
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:20,872
Hold it, lady!

39
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,970
Nice car...

40
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:32,007
You must be a very important man.

41
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,685
I watch this picture all here.

42
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,618
What business are you in, Mr. King?

43
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:52,229
Banking. I transfer funds
from one place to another.

44
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,349
What do you admire most in a woman?

45
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:12,356
Well, actually, all parts.

46
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,731
What do you look for in a man?

47
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:22,223
- Honesty.
- And second?

48
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,941
How long have you
been a widow, Alicia?

49
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,508
Since the 4th of July.

50
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:46,192
That night we were celebrating,
Charlie and I.

51
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,992
We could see the firecrackers
from the bedroom window.

52
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:56,536
Well, Charlie got a little
too exited you might say...

53
00:08:56,536 --> 00:09:01,166
he went out just like
those firecrackers.

54
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,234
Goodbye, Charlie.

55
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,779
A lady like you shouldn't
be traveling alone.

56
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,324
I am not.

57
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,333
So you're the lucky man.

58
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,029
Happy, darling?

59
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:42,315
A fine gentleman would take off
his hat. There's a lady present.

60
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,011
We are gathered here...

61
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,487
A penny for you thoughts, Mrs. King?

62
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:01,400
Are there any cases of
insanity in your family?

63
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,459
You can't do this to me!

64
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,375
We're supposed to be married!

65
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,782
How long you think he will
be admitted, doctor?

66
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,585
At least 6 months.

67
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:22,611
Here. I want him to see that...

68
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,313
he has the best of...
the best of care.

69
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,763
Bye bye, darling.

70
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,499
What will you have?

71
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,468
- A beer. A big one.
- Make it three.

72
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,173
I think he's crazy
bringing us back to this town.

73
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,266
We didn't rob that bank not
twice, but over three times.

74
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:28,302
Maybe he ain't coming.
Maybe he never send for us.

75
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,183
Maybe it's a trap.
We have no guns.

76
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:34,118
- Let's go before they recognize us.
- Wait a minute! Go where?

77
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,815
Who is paying?

78
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,469
- Ah, we're waiting.
- We got an appointment.

79
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,130
- With a very important man.
- Yeah...

80
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:01,440
Listen, bumps.
Either you pay or I use this.

81
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:08,314
The party's upstairs, boys.

82
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,624
You took your time getting here.

83
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,303
What is your proposal?

84
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,908
Half for me, and half for you.

85
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:32,645
Bull, there is one of you
and there's eight of us.

86
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:39,852
That gives you one share.
That makes 11% or $ 2,750.

87
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,021
It's my town.
I send for you.

88
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,216
I won't take less than $ 5,000.

89
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,622
$ 4,000.

90
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,320
That's my final offer.

91
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,265
It's a deal.

92
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,836
- Friends, to the dying day.
- Add some days more!

93
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,361
- To the end.
- To the end.

94
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,343
But to what business are we in?

95
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,045
Yeah, I can hardly wait
to start working.

96
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:09,548
It will be a new experience.
What business are we in?

97
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,106
Personal Service.

98
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,878
Personal? Sounds great.

99
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,568
Are we gonna start a revolution?

100
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:56,829
The "Ariel".
It will be docked about 10 minutes.

101
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,320
Boys, we're gonna take a boat ride.

102
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,026
Oh, help yourselves.

103
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:09,671
Where is everybody?
Hey, wait here.

104
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:14,837
Give me a drink, will you?
Just one.

105
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,145
Come on, one.

106
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,619
Come on.

107
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,719
Give me a drink, will you?

108
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,946
Everything is set, Mr. King.

109
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:32,151
I wanted to hear right from you, Mr. Montero.

110
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,413
Come here.

111
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,215
Tomorrow night, at this time...

112
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,918
Mr. King, please!

113
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:49,435
Listen. Tomorrow night at this time
the boat will have carried us 20km ...

114
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,027
of the St. Joseph Mission.

115
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:56,939
- That's the place. That's it.
- That's what? Hey, King!

116
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,779
The Mexican army
uses the mission as arsenal.

117
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:03,148
What senor Montero wants
us to do is to blow it up.

118
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,850
Why does he want us
to blow it up?

119
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,377
What the hell we do care? If we're
getting paid we'll to blow it up.

120
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,857
Uh, when we get paid?

121
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:15,294
Senor Montero says we get paid
when we get back to the boat.

122
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:19,064
- $ 1,0000 in gold.
- How do we know he will pay?

123
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:24,161
I know about Montero. If he gives his
word, that's enough for me. Right, King?

124
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,284
I've been expecting you.

125
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:50,187
I had a hard day at work.

126
00:18:57,236 --> 00:19:00,906
- I did you dirty.
- Easy come, easy go.

127
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:05,544
- You a quick man to forgive.
- You forgot everything.

128
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,739
My conscience still bothers me.

129
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,317
You're deep sensitive.

130
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:16,155
- I couldn't get you out of my mind.
- So you married Montero.

131
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:20,159
- I had to forget you.
- We never did our honeymoon.

132
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,925
- I'm afraid I wasn't a very good wife.
- Why makes you say that?

133
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,160
- I could have tried harder.
- True.

134
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:33,205
But I did get you this job.

135
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:36,074
I still think you owe
me a little something.

136
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:41,011
I often wondered what'd happen
if we had a second chance?

137
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,206
We will.

138
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,420
Aren't you getting familiar?

139
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,091
We've met before.

140
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,827
My husband is right out there.

141
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,795
Then don't make a noise.

142
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:06,263
- You're looking for trouble.
- I've come to the right place.

143
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:07,387
There's the sheep.
I am very thirsty. Can I...?

144
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,805
Be quick about it.

145
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,636
- Sit down.
- Let go, you pig.

146
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,617
I'll buy you a drink.

147
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,211
- I only drink with officers.
- I have gold.

148
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,661
Move, old man.
What is your name?

149
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,562
- Angel.
- I am Conchita.

150
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,104
- I think I like you.
- That's good!

151
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:22,074
You only got one piece of gold?
Maybe two?

152
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:24,770
Maybe three, four, maybe even five.

153
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:31,917
How would you like me to get
...real friendly?

154
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,943
- Maybe we could visit the church.
- That's the arsenal.

155
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,990
Going there you could die.

156
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,857
- But we'll find a place.
- Conchita!

157
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,555
Time to feed the animals.

158
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,440
Having fun?

159
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:39,142
Come up, let's go upstairs.
I truly like you. Come on.

160
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:57,436
Not so fast.

161
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,505
You pay me now all of the
money you got or I'll scream.

162
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:01,767
Scream.

163
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:34,865
Would you like to kiss?

164
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,907
I don't trust you.

165
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:06,592
- What are you doing here?
- What's going on here?

166
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,964
Son of a dog.
You and your family.

167
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,081
First things first.

168
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,994
He came to the pastor.

169
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,769
Who are you?

170
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,031
Search him!

171
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,314
Check the arsenal.

172
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,685
Make him talk.

173
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,588
Talk, my friend.

174
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,515
Give us a hand.

175
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:51,151
Sergeant, we need help here.

176
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:26,655
Hold it!

177
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:19,911
Come on!

178
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:21,242
King!

179
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,544
- Odie!
- Yeah?

180
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,724
- All clear. Come on!
- Right!

181
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:54,130
They are passing us by, King.

182
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,779
It will only get and hour before
they start catching up with us.

183
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,982
This is no place to make a stand.

184
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,042
They better pick us up.
One man's on our pay-roll.

185
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,072
Why don't you pull the trigger?

186
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:03,336
We still need him.
I can't swim.

187
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,847
I ought to stay with him, King.

188
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:14,284
I don't think it will be necessary.
Will it, Captain?

189
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,811
You will cross to the American side.

190
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:42,780
Yes, and we're gonna chase them
on both sides of the river.

191
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,184
If the American cavalry catches you,
I will dishonor you completely.

192
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:50,321
What, Excellency? Even I can
become useful toMexico.

193
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:53,024
If the revolutionaries had gold...

194
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:56,861
- you would be Working for them.
- Yes, Your Excellency.

195
00:34:56,861 --> 00:35:01,499
- You're nothing but a bandit.
- Yes, Your Excellency.

196
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:05,060
Remember, Canales.
When the revolution is over...

197
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:09,571
- I promise to hang you.
- Yes, Your Excellency.

198
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:34,699
- Where is the 10,000?
- There is no 10,000.

199
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:38,032
- It's a million or nothing.
- Is that good, King?

200
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:41,739
Okay, I'll level with you.

201
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,908
Why do you think we
have to blow up the arsenal?

202
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,671
To win the revolution.

203
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,715
- Stupid
- The guns to be destroyed ...

204
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,718
will have to be replaced by
the Mexican government, right?

205
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,286
- Right.
- Right.

206
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,289
- And where is the 1 million?
- Yes, get us to it again.

207
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:02,827
The Mexican government is sending
$ 1 million to El Paso...

208
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,162
to buy new guns.

209
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,331
The Mexican government is sending
$ 1 million to El Paso...

210
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,033
to buy new guns.

211
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:12,270
- And we grab the million.
- And we grab the million!

212
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,862
That's good!

213
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:23,247
- How?
- Montero is a revolutionary.

214
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:27,585
But he is also an agent
for the Mexican government.

215
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:33,191
By taking the check and cashing it,
he serves the revolution...

216
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,892
And even makes him patriotic.

217
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:39,096
Exactly.
And then we split 50-50.

218
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,758
50-50?
50! Great!

219
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,967
Why do we need Montero?

220
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,739
Boat his landing.

221
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:53,010
- So why do you need us?
- I don't trust him.

222
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,812
That's bad.

223
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:58,216
- Your own husband?
- Not for a $ 1 million.

224
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,185
- She doesn't trust her husband.
- Got it.

225
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,254
Boys...

226
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,983
I think we've been
stuck at it again.

227
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:54,839
- Is mister Montero here?
- Number 3.

228
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,103
- Is he alone?
- There's another man with him.

229
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:11,786
- Dreaming of $ 25,000?
- Cut it, Odie.

230
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:24,335
Who is he?

231
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,768
I guess he had the money.

232
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:00,693
Come on! Come on!

233
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:49,279
Idiot!

234
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:04,230
Nothing!

235
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:07,400
Let's go.

236
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,849
Nothing!

237
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:41,398
Surround them.
They have the check.

238
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:55,483
Bring me "Adelita".

239
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:11,826
This is a trap.

240
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:42,462
Right. You can go in now
and collect the bodies.

241
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:53,277
Tiburcio, Luiz ...

242
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:56,371
go inside and you will find
a check for $ 1 million!

243
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:27,477
- Mr. King!
- I hear you.

244
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:29,913
I do not wish to fight with you.

245
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:35,352
- I can tell that.
- I'm coming. Here I come.

246
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,718
- Come on.
- Has he brought the check?

247
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:40,279
He didn't have it on him.

248
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:47,598
You know about the check too?

249
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:50,795
Everyone knows.
All these dead and no money.

250
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,064
I would like you to
make you a deal, King.

251
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:56,807
I've already got a deal.

252
00:47:56,807 --> 00:48:00,711
Look, I'm a bandit and you
rob banks, right?

253
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,973
Get to the point.

254
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:10,214
So we both want the same thing.
Other people's money. Right?

255
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:18,392
So you and I are on the same side.
We are amigos.

256
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:26,904
Listen, where does
that money come from?

257
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,772
The Mexican government.

258
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:32,175
And who is
the Mexican government?

259
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:36,813
The Mexican people.
And who is the Mexican people?

260
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:42,843
I'm a Mexican person,
and so are you, my friend.

261
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,351
So what can I do for you, amigo?

262
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:52,562
Listen, that Ms. Montero,
she is not to be trusted.

263
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:54,064
A bad woman.

264
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:58,235
You give her to me, and
I'll find the money. OK?

265
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:02,606
- How will you do that?
- You know!

266
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,471
Yeah. I'd rather do it myself.

267
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:17,821
- Did you... did you catch him?
- We caught him.

268
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:22,326
- Is he dead?
- You're a widow again.

269
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:26,029
- Oh, I'm just bad luck.
- You mustn't blame yourself.

270
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:31,068
- I'll never marry again.
- Don't punish yourself.

271
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:35,172
- I'm better off dead.
- You mustn't give up hope.

272
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:38,508
If only I had
one good reason to go on...

273
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:41,278
You got millions of good reasons.

274
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:43,880
He had the check on him?

275
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,216
I'm not looking for
a change of underwear!

276
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:48,275
You know damn well he
never had that check.

277
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:54,456
You've had figured tat if we would kill
Montero and the bandits would kill us.

278
00:49:56,827 --> 00:50:01,398
You could have flown with the whole
million and leave two dead husbands.

279
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:03,533
I never figured Canales...

280
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:06,001
I'm sorry. Go on.

281
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:09,330
He never wanted me,
he wants you.

282
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:13,039
To marry me?

283
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:18,513
No, the money.
He says you have the money.

284
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:21,139
Search me.

285
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:25,851
- I will.
- You wouldn't.

286
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:35,221
I never loved.

287
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:39,770
He forced you to marry.

288
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:44,469
- I had reached the end of my rope.
- He took advantage.

289
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:49,212
If only I knew where
I'd find to you ...

290
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:54,616
- It was not so difficult.
- I hope it's not too late.

291
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:04,057
- I better start at the bottom.
- I'll scrub floors for you.

292
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:08,029
And I'll climb mountains for you.

293
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:13,403
You're all I ever wanted.

294
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:17,100
We'll make history... together.

295
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:28,481
You stay here.

296
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:50,574
He did get shot?

297
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:54,411
I slapped him. He was steering us
right into that bandit's arms.

298
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:56,179
You slapped him pretty hard.

299
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:58,044
- He's tough.
- Like a board.

300
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:18,699
- Now, don't tell me you're
the chamber-maid. - All right.

301
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:22,806
I'm not the chamber-maid.

302
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,297
- What are you looking for?
- A man.

303
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:31,047
- You can do better than that!?
- I'm looking for Montero.

304
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:33,140
You're looking in the wrong place.
He's dead.

305
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:37,554
He's alive and he is on this boat.

306
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:39,856
If the Montero was not dead...

307
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:42,592
he was putting on
one hell of an act.

308
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:46,863
- The Montero you saw was an impersonator.
- What makes you say that?

309
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:51,368
- You didn't find the bank draft?
- What the hell are you talking about?

310
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:53,996
Does everybody know
about the bank draft?

311
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:58,670
You can't keep
$ 1 million in secret.

312
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,224
- I want to look in your eyes.
- Why?

313
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:24,201
- Damn liar!
- What is it this time?

314
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,692
Where did you hide the real Montero?

315
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:32,209
- He's back in Mexico.
- You're lying again! Where is he?

316
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,267
Safe from you.

317
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:37,802
Safe from me?
You worried about him?

318
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:43,887
He got what he wanted, then he
staked you out as a hostage ...

319
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,946
and you're worried about him?

320
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:49,454
It bothers you, does it?

321
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:52,662
A man like that ought to be shot.

322
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:55,756
Because of the money or
because he is my husband?

323
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:02,628
Not in there.

324
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:16,475
Paco!

325
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:30,759
- Getting stuffy in here.
- You appeared not a second too soon.

326
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:35,639
You're gonna shoot me, Mr. King?

327
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:38,441
You killed the man in that closet.
Now let's take your turn now.

328
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:43,847
I didn't kill anybody, but I know
what killed that man: politics.

329
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:45,448
You're still is a killer.

330
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:48,918
A man who kills for political reasons
is not a killer, he's an assassin.

331
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:51,011
I don't like to be
associated with killers.

332
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,491
Now I'll trouble you
for that bank-draft.

333
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,960
- I don't have it.
- Where is it?

334
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,863
- It's a little complicated.
- Make it simple.

335
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:03,066
Perhaps you noticed the "Wells Fargo"
when the boat was landing?

336
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:03,786
I saw the place.

337
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:07,971
That's where I cast the draft and
had the money shipped to Laredo.

338
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,539
Ship to who?

339
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:11,905
Why? To me, of course.
Who else would I trust?

340
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:18,415
- That's a gun you're reaching for.
- No. It's my receipt.

341
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:20,116
It states that the receiver...

342
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:25,188
must be positively identified
as Francisco Montero.

343
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:28,385
You see? I told you
he was safe from you.

344
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:34,755
Okay, Montero.
We'll reaching for Laredo together.

345
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:39,529
We're not going to reach
Laredo, not by boat.

346
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:47,669
The engines stopped running a while back.
We are just drifting with the currency.

347
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,685
You had to hire your ex-husband?

348
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,655
When I married him
he was so softly.

349
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:01,385
The engine is wrecked.
Somebody threw in a wrench.

350
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:09,523
Do we make it to Laredo?

351
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,195
We don't seem.
The bandits can take us.

352
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,907
Tell Odie to stick at the Mexican side.

353
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:19,642
That's a mistake.

354
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:22,278
You better go to the  bandits
on the American side?

355
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:26,715
- That will be a fatal error.
- The better chance we have to take, sweetheart.

356
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:36,986
Surrender, amigo.

357
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:40,859
You are a prisoner of the revolution.

358
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,583
- You have all been denounced.
- For what?

359
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:36,984
For enemies of the revolution
there is only one punishment.

360
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:40,590
She can't be.

361
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:43,960
- This lady is my wife.
- She's my wife!

362
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,088
A marriage dispute?
I'll settle it.

363
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:49,098
Shoot the lady.

364
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:51,868
Lieutenant, I want to speak
to the commander yet.

365
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:53,436
You know the commander?

366
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:56,573
Colonel Fierro
was created at the Academy.

367
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:59,142
Well, how times have changed!

368
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,711
Yes, for old times sake...

369
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:04,179
I'll ask the Colonel
to have you shot.

370
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:11,252
If you're a friend of the Colonel...

371
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,125
- Henry!
- Paco!

372
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:29,539
- It's good we meet again.
- Once more on the wrong side.

373
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:31,029
There you have the prisoners.

374
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:44,075
Forgive me.

375
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:56,165
I know you.

376
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:59,202
Stop the firing-squad!
Where are we?

377
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,471
Perhaps you saw my face
on a poster.

378
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:04,599
In America he's a famous bandit.

379
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,935
And how much are you worth?

380
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:13,175
$ 10,000, the last time.

381
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:21,624
And... your friends?

382
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:24,889
$ 25,000, all together.

383
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:30,088
I think you're holding out on me.

384
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:39,142
Oh Luiz, how many times
must I tell you...

385
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:41,477
not to interrupt when
I'm interrogating?

386
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:45,937
- I forget, You Excellency.
- Oh, remember, remember.

387
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:51,477
Dolores, come here darling!

388
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:57,288
Tell me again about the $ 1 million
bank-draft payment in Laredo.

389
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:01,653
I delivered the chickens.
Don't break the eggs.

390
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:05,898
Smart girl!

391
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:08,761
Lock them up.

392
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:35,298
Don't you think we'd be all better off
if we behaved in a more civilized manner?

393
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:38,801
- What's that mean?
- What the hell did she see in you?

394
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:41,170
I'm afraid you could never understand.

395
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:43,706
- I'm gonna do it now.
- No. Wait!

396
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:48,678
I tell you what Montero, you
talk about being civilized.

397
01:00:48,678 --> 01:00:50,703
I got a proposition.

398
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,983
- We share.
- We share what?

399
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:57,419
We share everything,
including the woman.

400
01:00:58,554 --> 01:01:02,925
With all the money we're gonna get,
we'd have plenty to live in Paris.

401
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:05,428
You speak French?

402
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:08,097
You hear what he called you!
You're gonna stand...?

403
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:13,069
You see, you have a language problem.
And there they drink wine.

404
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:15,138
To you that taste like perfume.

405
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:20,143
The only excitement is the opera
and stroll at the Bois de Bologne...

406
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:24,409
a park to you... where you
live it up by feeding the swans.

407
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:29,852
- No, you wouldn't be happy with this.
- Well, I think I'd rather be dead!

408
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,285
You see?

409
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:51,667
Get out of the way!

410
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:55,071
Open the door!

411
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:01,072
Come on!

412
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:01,440
I wonder what Napoleon would do,
at a time like this?

413
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:06,549
Soldiers of the Revolution,
your moment of glory has arrived!

414
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:08,384
You're about to become a legend!

415
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:12,288
Your names will be for ever
in the books of heroes!

416
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:16,952
Because of what you're about to do,
bells will ring throughout the land!

417
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:24,397
Forward!

418
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:42,785
Senor Montero tells me you know
something about explosives.

419
01:03:42,785 --> 01:03:44,616
We've blown up a few things.

420
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:48,086
The federal cannon...

421
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:55,264
I find it very annoying.

422
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:56,788
Silence the Cannon...

423
01:03:57,934 --> 01:03:59,765
and I'll release you.

424
01:04:03,206 --> 01:04:04,730
It's a deal.

425
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:10,606
First tell your plan.

426
01:04:12,148 --> 01:04:15,640
Well, I'm not gonna attack
with a sword.

427
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:21,079
No, I'm sure your devilish mind
is better equipped for treachery.

428
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:23,882
It takes one to know one.

429
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:28,587
Come on.

430
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:31,691
Right here.

431
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,235
We are not bandits.

432
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:09,864
We respect the flag of truce.
Let them through.

433
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:31,125
- Are you the boss, amigo?
- Excellency. Call him Excellency.

434
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,119
Excellency.

435
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:38,964
Wait, Excellency!
I know these men.

436
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:49,409
But where?

437
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:52,413
Who is your spokesman?

438
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,652
Me, Excellency.

439
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:59,985
- Why does he not speak?
- Yeah, Why don't you speak?

440
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:06,729
What kind of officers are you?
Where do you come from?

441
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:09,365
He is my cousin.
We come from the same village.

442
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:15,071
Excellency, now I remember. Sure!

443
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:19,308
I saw those faces a little
time back. I'm positive.

444
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:22,675
I know that man like my own brother!

445
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:27,209
But who is he?

446
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:32,989
Tell the colonel that I only accept
an unconditional surrender.

447
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,557
No terms.

448
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:38,493
You understand what that means:
unconditional surrender?

449
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:47,370
Anyway, we didn't come to talk about
surrender but we came for something else.

450
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,031
What else?

451
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:54,243
Well, Excellency,
it's about the cannon.

452
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:56,979
It's very annoying to the Colonel.

453
01:06:56,979 --> 01:07:01,484
So you came to ask me to stop
firing the cannon?

454
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:04,942
Yeah, si, we want to buy the cannon.

455
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:11,459
You hear that?
Our friend wants to buy our cannon.

456
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:15,896
And what will you pay for it?

457
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:19,335
$ 1 million.

458
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:24,540
Of course.
Montero and the $ 1 million.

459
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:28,344
You have Montero in the fort.

460
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:31,914
Tell Fierro that
I'm not interested in his offer.

461
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:34,183
No, with my cannon I will
pulverize the fort.

462
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:36,719
We'll get the money, Montero...

463
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:39,321
I will hang Fierro, and kill you!

464
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:42,158
Remember the flag of truce, Excellency.

465
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:44,683
One minute to get back to the fort!

466
01:07:56,338 --> 01:07:58,707
Look out! What you're doing?

467
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:00,368
- Come on!
- Idiota!

468
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:05,847
Caution! Sergeant!

469
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:09,078
Sergeant!

470
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:30,840
Fire! Fire!
Kill them all! Fire!

471
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:35,377
- Excellency, now I remember!
- What? Shoot!

472
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:38,414
- You know who they are?
- Who?

473
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:40,712
I never forget a face!

474
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:46,813
We won! We won!

475
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:08,202
We lost! We lost!

476
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:26,128
Do you think they would
mind going there again?

477
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:29,365
I remember very well, Excellency.
The King gang.

478
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:32,201
The four gringos who
blew up the mission.

479
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:34,066
So why do you do this to me?

480
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:40,576
I told you, I told you...

481
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:42,635
I never forget a face.

482
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:52,688
You know the general
who is besieging us?

483
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:57,159
Duarte?
We went to the Academy together.

484
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:58,594
Is he rich?

485
01:09:58,594 --> 01:10:02,331
His family owns half of Mexico.

486
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:04,322
Is he married?

487
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:10,673
Why?

488
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:13,005
The battle is going badly, Colonel.

489
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:17,112
Last night you said you loved me.

490
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:19,376
Let's be practical.

491
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:24,453
- What do you want me to do?
- Surrender.

492
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:26,921
To Duarte? Never!

493
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:32,255
I used to polish his boots
at the Academy.

494
01:10:33,762 --> 01:10:35,696
Do it for me then.

495
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,615
Colonel!

496
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:55,985
They are bringing the cannons.
Where's the colonel?

497
01:10:55,985 --> 01:11:00,556
Whoever built this fort is a stupid.
It is a prison for everybody inside.

498
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:04,360
I promised to release you,
not a safe journey to Laredo.

499
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,695
- Where is Montero?
- Well, I told you to watch him.

500
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:10,290
- Why didn't you watch him yourself?
- Worried about me, gentlemen?

501
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:15,771
- Look what I've found.
- What is it?

502
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:18,763
What looks like?
An old map of the fort.

503
01:11:22,478 --> 01:11:28,439
Put your foot on that corner, you
over there. colonel, if you please.

504
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:31,517
What do you see?

505
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:36,287
Looks like a tunnel.

506
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:39,187
Where does it lead?

507
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:43,857
- To the river.
- And where does it start?

508
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:48,530
- In the church.
- What does that suggest to you?

509
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:55,638
Come now, even you're the infantry,
it should mean something to you.

510
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,715
- I've got it!
- He's got it.

511
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:06,187
If the well runs dry,
we can get water from the river.

512
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:11,350
- It's an escape route.
- It's an escape route!

513
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:16,128
That's what I said!

514
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:40,919
- Are you afraid of the dark, my dear?
- The only thing she's afraid of is poverty.

515
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:05,634
Do you see anything, soldier?
I don't know, EXcellencia.

516
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:08,403
They are very busy up there
building something.

517
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:11,600
- Building what?
- I can't really figure it out.

518
01:15:13,909 --> 01:15:15,844
Don't you hear it?

519
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:18,540
Silence! Silence!

520
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:32,461
It sounds like sawing wood
and hammering nails.

521
01:15:32,461 --> 01:15:37,228
They're spending their last few
hours to make their own coffins.

522
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:21,043
I dreamed of riding in that car
down the boulevard in Mexico City.

523
01:16:21,043 --> 01:16:25,639
The crowd cheering: "Fierro!
Long live the president!"

524
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,318
Who did you steal it from?

525
01:16:29,318 --> 01:16:33,084
It's a gift, from a dead banker.

526
01:16:35,057 --> 01:16:36,888
Come with us, Enrique.

527
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:42,160
You already have two husbands.
What would you do with me?

528
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:45,061
I'll think of something.

529
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:57,309
- What do you see?
- They're watching us.

530
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:27,164
Goodbye, Enrique. Do you have
any last message for your wife?

531
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:32,948
Remember, Enrique...

532
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:35,041
A brave man dies only once.

533
01:17:49,531 --> 01:17:53,735
- Remember the Alamo.
- The Alamo? The Alamo?

534
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:55,726
That's the battle we won.

535
01:17:57,039 --> 01:17:58,267
I know!

536
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:12,483
The guns are ready.

537
01:18:23,098 --> 01:18:25,999
Now we'll blast those gates open.

538
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:35,942
Fire! Fire at will!

539
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:50,852
Hey, I'm a bandit, but you!

540
01:19:50,852 --> 01:19:52,581
How did you get here?

541
01:19:57,392 --> 01:19:58,916
It wasn't easy.

542
01:20:24,853 --> 01:20:29,124
You two should be friends.
You have a lot in common: me.

543
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:30,992
How do we share you?

544
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:33,995
What do you suggesting?
A picnic?

545
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:37,897
- Oh, what do you think I am?
- Shall we answer that?

546
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,405
In a few minutes you'll be rich.
You can have any girl you want.

547
01:20:43,405 --> 01:20:46,541
I got to work on you while you're still poor.

548
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:50,278
First thing I'm gonna do is buy
you a new velvet dress.

549
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:52,337
One that comes off easy.

550
01:21:17,973 --> 01:21:19,838
Mr. Francisco Montero.

551
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:22,171
Sign here.

552
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:44,622
The signature checks.

553
01:21:47,802 --> 01:21:49,702
Correct identification.

554
01:22:30,979 --> 01:22:32,640
Sign here, Mr. Montero.

555
01:22:36,084 --> 01:22:37,574
Stick them up.

556
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:40,387
Stick them up!

557
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:48,429
- Are you coming, darling?
- I'll be right with you, Jesse.

558
01:23:23,698 --> 01:23:25,495
How am I doing, papa?

559
01:23:27,102 --> 01:23:28,899
Just like your dear mother.
