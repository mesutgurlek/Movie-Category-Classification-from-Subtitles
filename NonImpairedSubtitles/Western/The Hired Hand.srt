00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,120

3
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,120
HEY, HARRY!!

4
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,520
GODDAMN, HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN
BOILING THESE GROUNDS?

5
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,040
TASTES AWFUL SOUR TO ME.

6
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,040
WELL, YOU CAN THROW THEM
AWAY AFTER THIS.

7
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
WE'LL BE IN DEL NORTE BY NOON.

8
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,040
WE'LL BUY SOME FRESH.

9
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,560
HEY, ARCH,

10
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,560

11
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,040
WELL, WE AIN'T GOT NONE.

12
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,040
THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET.

13
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,560
YOU SET ON THE COAST, DAN?

14
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,560
WHAT THE HELL?
WE GOT NOTHING BUT TIME.

15
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,560
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

16
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,080
THAT IS WHERE IT'S REALLY GOOD,
OUT THERE IN CALIFORNIA.

17
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,560
YOU GOT YOUR --
YOU GOT YOUR WEATHER.

18
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,080
YOUR WOMAN ARE HALF-MEX,
HALF-AMERICAN.

19
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,080
YOU GOT YOUR GOLD...

20
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,080
AND ORANGES...

21
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,080
AND THE OCEAN.

22
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,080
THEY SAY THAT OCEAN LOOKS
LIKE A GREAT BLUE PRAIRIE.

23
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
I AIN'T NEVER SEEN
THAT MUCH WATER.

24
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
ME NEITHER.

25
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,600
THIS HERE'S THE MOST WATER
I EVER SAW.

26
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
HEY, HARRY.

27
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,600
DID YOU LEAVE THE LINE SET?

28
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,080
WELL... NEVER CAN TELL.

29
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,600
YOU MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING.

30
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,600
HE'S ALL RIGHT, HARRY.

31
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,120
HE'S JUST YOUNG, FULL OF PISS
AND VINEGAR, LIKE YOU WAS.

32
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,360
WAS I LIKE THAT?

33
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
SURE ENOUGH.

34
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,880
HE'S ALWAYS WANTING TO GO
SOMEPLACE HE HASN'T BEEN.

35
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,000
YOU REALLY WANT TO
GO TO THE COAST, ARCH?

36
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
GOOD AS ANYWHERE.
BETTER THAN MOST.

37
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
WHAT'S YOUR FANCY, HARRY?

38
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,640
ARCH! HARRY!

39
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,240
COME HERE, QUICK!

40
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,280
HARRY!

41
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,800
LET ME GO!

42
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,320
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU AT, ANYWAY?!

43
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,320
HEY, WHAT DOES HE THINK
HE'S DOING,

44
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
LETTING HER FLOAT AWAY
LIKE THAT?

45
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,320
BEEN DEAD AWHILE, WHATEVER IT WAS.

46
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,320
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"WHATEVER IT WAS"?

47
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,840
IT WAS A LITTLE WHITE GIRL.

48
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,840
IT'S A LITTLE BLONDE WHITE GIRL.

49
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,840
YOU'D BE DUMPING PIECES
IN YOUR HANDS

50
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
THE MOMENT YOU STARTED
TO PULL HER IN.

51
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,160
HI.

52
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,880
HI.

53
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,640
YOU FELLOWS KNOW WHERE I CAN
FIND A MAN TO SHOE MY HORSE?

54
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,160
THREW A FRONT PLATE
A MILE OR SO BACK.

55
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,040
UH, TELL ME SOMETHING, BOY.

56
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,520
YOU ALWAYS RIDE AROUND
IN YOUR COMBINATIONS?

57
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,040
WELL, I-I GOT WET
CROSSING THE RIVER,

58
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,520
THOUGHT I'D DRY OUT.

59
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,040
ANY OF YOU FELLOWS
A BLACKSMITH?

60
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,160
AIN'T NO BLACKSMITH
THAT LIVES HERE NOW.

61
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,680
YOU WANT ANY HORSESHOING DONE,

62
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,160
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GET IT DONE YOURSELF.

63
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,920
WELL... MUCH OBLIGED.

64
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,040
I'M OUT.

65
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,560
WELL, THINK I'LL HAVE A COLD BEER.

66
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,080
THEY AIN'T GOT NO BEER,

67
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,080
AND EVEN IF THEY DID HAVE,
IT WOULDN'T BE COLD.

68
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,560
THEY GOT, UH, THREE KINDS OF
TEQUILA AND ONE OF WHISKEY,

69
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,560
AND THEY'RE ALL GRAIN AND BAD.

70
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,080
WELL, WHAT KIND OF TOWN IS THIS ANYWAY?

71
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,600
AIN'T NO BLACKSMITH.
AIN'T NO COLD BEER.

72
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,080
DON'T SEE NO GIRLS.

73
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,080
AIN'T CHANGED MUCH,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

74
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,080
YOU MEAN
YOU BEEN HERE BEFORE?

75
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,080
YEAH. THREE YEARS AGO
WE WAS HERE.

76
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,080
ARCH HAD A BAD FOOT.

77
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,120
DAMNED HORSE STEPPED ON IT
AND BROKE ALL MY TOES.

78
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,320
YOU FELLOWS MADE UP YOUR MIND?

79
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,840
YEAH, GIVE US A BOTTLE OF THAT
DOUBLE EAGLE AND THREE GLASSES.

80
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,080
ONE EAGLE, THREE GLASSES.

81
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
Arch: WELL, HERE'S TO US.

82
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,000
HERE'S TO THE COAST.

83
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,480
HERE'S TO CALIFORNIA.

84
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
I AIN'T GOING.

85
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,480
HOW'S THAT, HARRY?

86
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,960
I AIN'T GOING TO THE COAST.

87
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,520
WHERE ARE YOU GONNA GO THEN?

88
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,040
HOME.

89
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,440
NOW, LOOK, HARRY,

90
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
IF IT'S BECAUSE OF ME
BEING SO TOUCHY THIS MORNING...

91
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,520
AIN'T TO DO WITH THAT, DAN.

92
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
OH.

93
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,640
MAYBE THERE AIN'T
NO SUCH COLOR.

94
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,680
WE GET TO THE COAST,
IT WON'T BE LIKE THIS.

95
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,160
WHERE I COME FROM,

96
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,160
THERE'S A GUY WHO KNEW A FELLOW
WHO WAS ON THE COAST.

97
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,080
SAID IT WAS DIFFERENT
FROM ANYTHING YOU EVER SAW.

98
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,600
HOME IS JUST A PLACE
YOU START FROM, ARCH.

99
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,640
THERE WILL BE SOMETHING THERE.

100
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,120
THINK MAYBE YOUR WIFE AND YOUR
LITTLE GIRL ARE STILL THERE?

101
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,040
DIDN'T KNOW YOU WAS MARRIED,
HARRY, HAD KIDS.

102
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,560
WHY DON'T YOU GO TO THE COAST,
MAKE SOMETHING, SEND FOR THEM?

103
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,560
YOU GO TO THE COAST, DAN.

104
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,080
AND WHEN, IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS,

105
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,560
YOU FIND YOURSELF SITTING HERE
DRINKING THIS RIDE LOTION,

106
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,080
YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS GONNA BE.

107
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,960
THE HELL WITH HIM.

108
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,480
THE HELL, I SAY.
WE DON'T NEED HIM.

109
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,480
WE CAN GO TO THE COAST
WITHOUT HIM, CAN'T WE, ARCH?

110
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,960
YOU KNOW HOW LONG ME AND HIM
RID TOGETHER?

111
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,000
I FORGET. LONG TIME.

112
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
SEVEN YEARS -- YEAR ROUND.

113
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
SEVEN YEARS --
IT'S A LONG TIME.

114
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,680
YOU MEAN YOU AIN'T GONNA GO
TO THE COAST?

115
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,320
YOU'RE GONNA GO WITH HARRY?

116
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,560
NO, DAN, I AIN'T GONNA GO
WITH HARRY.

117
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,600
DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THIS PLACE
UNTIL I SAW THAT PEAK.

118
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,080
THEN I REMEMBERED.

119
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,080
GUESS I DECIDED THEN.

120
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,600
IT'S JUST A WASTE
LIVING LIKE THIS, ARCH.

121
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,120
IT'S BEEN BUILDING UP
A LONG WHILE.

122
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,040
WELL, I'LL GO ON
WITH THE BOY.

123
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,080
ALWAYS WANTED
TO SEE THAT OCEAN.

124
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,560
COME ON.

125
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,400
IT'S A REAL GOOD ONE, SAM.

126
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,920
IT'S A REAL GOOD ONE.

127
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,400
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THAT BOTTLE.

128
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,920
HEY, BOY...

129
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,920
THERE AIN'T HARDLY
A MOUTHFUL LEFT IN HERE.

130
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,440
HAVE TO GET ANOTHER ONE.

131
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,680
GONNA RIDE OUT
IN THE MORNING?

132
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,200
NOT THE WAY I'M DRINKING
THIS WHISKEY, I WON'T.

133
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,200
HOW LONG IS IT GONNA TAKE YOU
TO RIDE BACK?

134
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,560
A WEEK, THERE ABOUTS.

135
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,040
HOW YOU KNOW THERE'S
ANYTHING FOR YOU THERE?

136
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,560
I MEAN, WHAT IF SHE'S MARRIED?

137
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,560
HAVEN'T THOUGHT ON IT.

138
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,080
YEAH.

139
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,560
WELL...

140
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,560
YOU COME ON OUT TO THE COAST,

141
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,080
MAYBE WE'LL MEET UP AGAIN.

142
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,080
MAYBE, ARCH.

143
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,520
MAYBE SO.

144
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,520
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
DAN'S ALREADY BEEN HERE

145
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
AND GOT HIMSELF SOMETHING ELSE.

146
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,040
WELL, WHAT'LL YOU HAVE?

147
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,040
SAME AS YOUR PARTNER?

148
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,560
WELL, WHAT DID HE HAVE?

149
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,040
WELL, HE HAD A BIT OF PRIME.

150
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,560
THREE DOLLARS WORTH
TO BE EXACT.

151
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,560
WELL, I GUESS DAN'S
IN TONIGHT.

152
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,040
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
GIVE US A COUPLE SHOTS

153
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,560
OF THAT DOUBLE EAGLE THERE.

154
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,480
OH, MOTHER!

155
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,960
MOTHER!

156
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,400
IS HE DEAD?

157
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,000
YOU SHOOT HIM?

158
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,480
THIS IS MY WIFE.

159
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,000
I FOUND HIM IN OUR HOUSE.
HE WAS ATTACKING HER.

160
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,480
I CALLED HIM, AND I THOUGHT
HE WENT FOR HIS GUN,

161
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,000
BUT I GUESS HE WAS JUST
PULLING ON HIS PANTS.

162
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,640
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE BURYIN'.

163
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,640
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

164
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,640
WE'LL SEE TO IT.

165
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,640
HOW'D HE FIND YOUR WIFE?

166
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,760
WELL, I GUESS HE JUST SAW HER
OUTSIDE AND FOLLOWED HER HOME.

167
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,760
WHEN I GOT THERE,
HE WAS ALL OVER HER.

168
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,280
YOU MIND IF I ASK
HER ABOUT THAT?

169
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,760
WELL, SHE DON'T SPEAK
ANY AMERICAN.

170
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,240
WON'T DO YOU ANY GOOD.

171
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,200
DON'T SEEM TO ME
THERE'S MUCH TO ASK.

172
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,720
THE WOMAN'S ALL MESSED UP.

173
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,720
YOUR FRIEND'S GOT HIS PANTS HALF OFF.

174
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,720
SEEMS PRETTY PLAIN TO ME.

175
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,720
WHERE CAN WE BURY HIM?

176
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,720
Sam: WHY DON'T YOU JUST LET THAT
GO TILL THE MORNIN'?

177
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,200
I'LL CLOSE MY CANTINA,

178
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,720
AND YOU CAN LET HIM
REST HERE FOR THE NIGHT.

179
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,720
WE'LL BURY HIM NOW.

180
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,680
JESUS SAID,
"LET THOSE WHO LEAD YOU SAY TO YOU,

181
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,440
"SEE THE KINGDOM IS IN HEAVEN."

182
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,440
"THEN THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVEN
WILL PRECEDE YOU.

183
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,000
"IF THEY SAY TO YOU
IT IS IN THE SEA,

184
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,480
"THEN THE FISH
WILL PRECEDE YOU.

185
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,680
BUT THE KINGDOM IS WITHIN YOU,
AND IT IS WITHOUT YOU."

186
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:14,240
A DISCIPLE SAID TO JESUS,
"TELL US HOW OUR END WILL BE."

187
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,360
JESUS SAID, "HAVE YOU THEN
DISCOVERED THE BEGINNING

188
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,320
"THAT YOU INQUIRE
ABOUT THE END?

189
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,800
"FOR WHERE THE BEGINNING IS,
THERE SHALL BE THE END.

190
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,800
"BLESSED IS HE WHO SHALL STAND
AT THE BEGINNING,

191
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,800
AND HE SHALL KNOW THE END
AND NOT TASTE DEATH."

192
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:39,760
"HIS DISCIPLE SAID TO HIM,
"WHEN WILL THE KINGDOM COME?

193
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,760
JESUS SAID,
"IT WILL NOT COME BY EXPECTATION.

194
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,240
"IT WILL NOT SAY,
'SEE HERE OR SEE THERE.'

195
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,720
"BUT THE KINGDOM OF THE FATHER
IS SPREAD UPON THE EARTH,

196
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,440
AND MEN DO NOT SEE IT."

197
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,400
AAH!

198
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,880
LET'S GO!

199
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,400
AAAH! GODDAMN!

200
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,920
DAMN!

201
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,400
GODDAMN!

202
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,920
AAAH!

203
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,400
AAAH!

204
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,920
AAAH!

205
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,280
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHAT'S SHE LIKE?

206
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,760
IS SHE TALL, THIN, FAT, ROUND,
BROWN HAIR, BLUE EYES?

207
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,280
WHAT'S SHE LIKE?

208
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:55,280
MEDIUM, RED HAIR...

209
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,800
BROWN EYES, I GUESS.

210
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,800
I THINK I KNOW HER.

211
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,800
SHE HAD A NICE VOICE.

212
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,320
HOW OLD IS SHE?

213
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,800
HOW OLD?

214
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:19,320
WELL, SHE WAS 30
WHEN WE WAS MARRIED.

215
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,800
AND HOW OLD WAS YOU?

216
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,320
20 -- JUST TURNED.

217
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,320
HELL, BOY,
YOU DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE.

218
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,840
AH, IT WEREN'T HER FAULT.

219
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,840
I WASN'T READY, THAT'S ALL.

220
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,840
TOO HOT TO RIDE
AND TOO HOT TO WALK.

221
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,320
WELL, IT AIN'T FAR NOW.

222
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,320
WONDER WHAT YOUR WIFE'S
GONNA SAY TO YOU

223
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,360
WHEN SHE LAYS EYES ON YOU,
HARRY.

224
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,840
WHAT I MEAN IS, WHAT KIND
OF NATURE DOES SHE HAVE?

225
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,360
I DON'T RIGHTLY RECALL.

226
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,840
ONLY LIVED WITH HER
ABOUT A YEAR AND NINE MONTHS.

227
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,840
WELL, IF I HAD A HORSE
FOR A YEAR AND NINE MONTHS,

228
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,840
I'D SURE KNOW
HOW MANY TEETH HE HAD.

229
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,880
WELL, SHE HAD THREE TEETH,
I REMEMBER THAT.

230
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,400
Hannah: HELLO?

231
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,000
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

232
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,520
GO ON INSIDE, JANEY.

233
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,000
I DON'T WANNA, MAMA.

234
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,000
GO ON.
DO LIKE I TOLD YOU.

235
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,520
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN, HANNAH?

236
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,400
WHY'D YOU COME BACK?

237
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,800
GOT TIRED OF THE LIFE.

238
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,160
WHAT ARE YOU HOPING FOR,
COMING AROUND HERE?

239
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,920
WORK.

240
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,920
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY RIGHT
TO COME BACK THIS WAY.

241
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,520
YOU THINK I CAN'T SEND YOU AWAY.

242
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,920
THINK YOU'RE STILL MARRIED TO ME,
BUT THAT AIN'T SO.

243
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,280
LOOK, HANNAH, JUST LET ME
WORK THE PLACE FOR A BIT,

244
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,040
LIKE A HIRED HAND.

245
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,400
NO DIFFERENCE.

246
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,920
SEE HOW IT RUNS.

247
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,320
I'M ASKING YOU, HANNAH.

248
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,320
I DON'T WANT JANEY UPSET.

249
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,200
AS FAR AS SHE KNOWS,
HER FATHER IS DEAD.

250
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,200
I DON'T WANT YOU SAYING
NO DIFFERENT.

251
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,160
SURE.

252
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,680
COME ON.

253
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,240
GET READY FOR BED.

254
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,240
SHOUT ME WHEN YOU'RE IN.

255
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,240
NOT 100, MAMA.
I COUNTED.

256
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,720
OFF YOU GO.
I'LL ADD THEM TO TOMORROW NIGHT.

257
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,720
THERE'S SOME SACKS IN THE SHED

258
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,720
AND SOME CLEAN STRAW
IN THE RACK.

259
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,240
SHOULD BE A LAMP THERE, TOO.

260
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,760
TOMORROW WE'LL TALK ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO.

261
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,240
NEED SOME THINKING
WHAT TO PUT YOU TO.

262
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,240
MAMA, I'M IN!

263
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,760
COMING, JANEY.

264
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,240
ALL RIGHT.
SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

265
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,880
DON'T MIND ME ASKING, MA'AM.

266
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,880
HOW COME YOU DON'T HAVE A DOG?

267
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,280
I NOTICE WHEN WE ROLLED UP
THERE WASN'T ONE.

268
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,280
HAD ONE, BUT IT RAN AWAY.

269
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,800
NEVER BOTHERED TO GET ANOTHER.

270
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,400
GOOD NIGHT, MA'AM.

271
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,880
WELCOME HOME, HARRY.

272
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,400
YEAH.

273
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,880
THE STRAW SMELLS GOOD.

274
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,920
BEATS SLEEPING ON THE GROUND.

275
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,400
WHAT DO YOU THINK, HARRY?
YOU THINK YOU'LL STAY?

276
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,960
HARRY'S TURNED IN.

277
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,440
HE'S SO TIRED,
HE CAN'T SEE PROPER.

278
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,960
BY YOUR LEAVE, MA'AM,
I'LL JUST FINISH MY SMOKE.

279
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,960
SURELY.

280
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,960
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING
OUT OF THIS, MR. HARRIS?

281
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,880
MA'AM, IF I WASN'T DOING THIS,
I'D BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE.

282
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,880
BE MORE PROSPECTS
IN SOMETHING ELSE.

283
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,680
WELL, ME AND HARRY, WE RID
AROUND TOGETHER A LONG TIME.

284
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,200
HE'S KEEN TO TRY THIS FOR AWHILE,

285
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,120
SO I'LL JUST STRING ALONG.

286
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,120
WHY'D HE COME BACK?

287
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,600
JUST GOT TIRED
OF DRIFTING AROUND.

288
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,120
HE'LL GO.

289
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,120
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME.

290
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:37,640
WELL, MOST THINGS ARE, MA'AM,
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

291
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,160
ASK MR. MARSHALL AT THE STORE

292
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,160
IF THAT LEAD PAINT
HAS COME YET.

293
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,160
WE CAN PAINT THE HOUSE
BEFORE WINTER COMES.

294
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,400
AND DON'T FORGET
THE JARS FOR PRESERVING FRUIT

295
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,920
AND DON'T FORGET MY CANDY.

296
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,160
CANDY?
YOU DON'T EAT CANDY, DO YOU?

297
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,920
LOOKY THERE, IT'S WRITTE
N DOWN -- "CANDY FOR JANEY."

298
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,920
COME ON. HEY!

299
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,440
BYE, JANEY.

300
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,800
I'LL GO ON OVER
TO THE GENERAL STORE.

301
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,800
YOU GO SET UP THE BEERS.

302
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,320
SOUNDS LIKE A REASONABLE
DIVISION OF LABOR.

303
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,560
GIVE ME TWO BEERS.

304
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,600
HELLO, THERE.

305
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,080
YOU RIDING ON THROUGH?

306
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,600
NO, SIR,
WE PICKED UP A JOB.

307
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,600
YOU WITH SOMEBODY ELSE?

308
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,600
YES, SIR.

309
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,480
WE'RE WORKING
FOR MISS COLLINGS.

310
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,960
OH? BOTH OF YOU?

311
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,480
YES, SIR, THAT'S RIGHT.

312
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:53,480
WELL, NOW, SHE'S REALLY DOWN
TO SOME SERIOUS BUSINESS.

313
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,480
SHE'S A FAIR WOMAN
TO WORK FOR, ALL RIGHT.

314
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
FAIR?

315
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,480
WHY, THE WIDOW COLLINGS
IS MORE THAN FAIR.

316
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,760
SHE'S DOWNRIGHT GENEROUS.

317
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,000
YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL A MAN
WHO'S GOT SOMETHING ON HIS MIND.

318
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,000
HE KEEPS TALKING TO PEOPLE
HE DON'T KNOW.

319
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,960
NOW WHAT IS IT
YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME?

320
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,440
WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU,
MISTER,

321
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,960
IS THAT MOST MEN WHO WORK
FOR THE WIDOW COLLINGS

322
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,600
GET PAID IN MORE THAN CASH AND KEEP.

323
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,080
I'LL SURELY REMEMBER THAT.

324
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,560
SAVE ME GETTING
A LOT OF FANCY NOTIONS.

325
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,800
AND YOU CAN TELL HER
WHEN YOU GET BACK

326
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,840
THAT ED PLUMMER
MIGHT TAKE A RIDE OUT TO SEE HER.

327
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,440
ONE OF THESE
MOONSHINE NIGHTS.

328
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,440
WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT,
ARCH?

329
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,200
THERE'S YOUR PARTNER.

330
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,720
HOW DO YOU WORK IT, BOYS?

331
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,720
NIGHT ABOUT,
OR DO YOU EACH DO A WEEK?

332
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:33,120
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HANNAH,
WASN'T HE?

333
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,120
WAS HE?

334
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,120
YOU KNOW HE WAS.

335
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,600
THAT'S WHY YOU HIT HIM.

336
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,640
STOPPED HIM FROM SAYING
SOMETHING ABOUT HER.

337
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,640
WHAT WAS IT, ARCH?

338
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,120
SAID SHE SLEPT
WITH THE HIRED HELP.

339
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,640
IF YOU'RE GONNA SWING AT ME,

340
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,640
I'LL TAKE A GREAT DEAL
OF PLEASURE

341
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,640
IN KICKING THE LIVING SHIT
OUT OF YOU.

342
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,640
DO YOU BELIEVE HIM?

343
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,120
HE WAS A MOUTH OFF.

344
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:03,160
IT'S THE KIND OF STORY
YOU FIND IN ANY SALOON.

345
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,160
YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT, ARCH?

346
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,640
OF COURSE I DO!

347
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,640
I AIN'T SAYING YOUR HANNAH

348
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,160
NEVER LOOKED THE SIDE
A MAN WAS ON...

349
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,160
BUT I SURE DON'T BELIEVE

350
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,160
WHAT THAT FELLOW
WAS SAYING.

351
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,560
IF I WAS YOU, HARRY,

352
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,560
I WOULDN'T BE PUTTING
NO QUESTIONS TO HER.

353
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,560
SHE AIN'T GONNA TAKE
TOO KINDLY

354
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,040
TO YOU SETTING UP
JUDGMENT ON HER.

355
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,040
GIDDYUP!

356
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,720
DID I GET THE FEELING

357
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,720
YOUR FRIEND HARRIS
MADE HIMSELF SCARCE?

358
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,240
COULD BE.

359
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,200
WHY COULD THAT BE NOW?

360
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,760
I GUESS HE KNOWS
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

361
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,760
WHAT ABOUT?

362
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,280
I HOPE YOU AIN'T GETTING
READY TO PROPOSE.

363
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:59,280
IN TOWN TODAY,
SOMEONE SAID...

364
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,800
THEY MADE SOME REMARKS
ABOUT YOU.

365
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,800
WHAT SORT OF REMARKS?

366
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,280
ABOUT YOU AND THE MEN
THAT WORKED HERE.

367
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,760
GO ON.
WHAT DID THEY SAY?

368
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,240
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAID.

369
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,760
THEY SAID YOU SLEPT
WITH ALL YOUR HIRED HANDS.

370
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,960
YOU HIRED MEN TO SLEEP WITH.

371
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,960
GOD, WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?

372
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,440
HOW MANY?
DOES IT MATTER?

373
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,960
OF COURSE IT MATTERS!

374
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,440
YOU WERE LONG GONE
BEFORE ANYBODY GOT INTO MY BED.

375
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,440
AND DON'T THINK THAT'S
'CAUSE I WAS HANKERING AFTER YOU.

376
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,920
I WASN'T.

377
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,920
THAT WAS AS LONG
AS I COULD STAND IT.

378
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,400
I WALKED ABOUT THIS ROOM
ON NIGHTS LIKE THIS,

379
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,400
GOING CRAZY FOR A MAN,
ANY MAN, DIDN'T MATTER.

380
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,920
AND SOMETIMES, WHEN THERE
WAS A MAN OUT THERE,

381
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,880
HE KNEW ABOUT IT,
AND HE'D COME IN.

382
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,360
AND SOMETIMES I'D HAVE HIM
OR HE'D HAVE ME --

383
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,840
WHATEVER SUITS YOU.

384
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:04,360
BUT NOT ALL OF THEM, AND NOT
EVERY TIME I WANTED TO.

385
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,360
AND WHEN THE SEASON'S WORK
WAS OVER, I'D PAY THEM OFF,

386
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,800
NO MATTER HOW WELL HE'D WORKED
OR HOW WELL HE'D PLEASED ME,

387
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,280
'CAUSE THE MAN
THAT'S IN A WOMAN'S BED

388
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,280
THINKS HE'S HER BOSS.

389
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,280
AND SOONER OR LATER,
THEY'D HAVE TRIED

390
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,760
TO MOVE THEIR TACKLE
OUT OF THE SHED AND IN HERE,

391
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,280
AND I DIDN'T WANT THAT,

392
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:23,280
'CAUSE I'D ALREADY
HAD ONE MAN IN HERE,

393
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,280
AND I DIDN'T WANT ANOTHER.

394
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,200
IS THAT ALL YOU WANTED TO ASK ME?

395
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,480
Woman: MISS COLLINGS?

396
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,480
MRS. COLLINGS?

397
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,000
OH, I WAS JUST PASSING,
THOUGHT I'D DROP BY.

398
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I NEVER SEEM TO CATCH YOU
IN TOWN SOMEHOW.

399
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
HELLO, MRS. SORENSON.

400
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
IT'S NOT OFTEN I GET VISITS
FROM YOUR GOOD SELF.

401
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,000
I'M SO GLAD
TO HEAR THE NEWS.

402
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,000
I'M SURE
YOU'RE VERY PLEASED.

403
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,520
OH?

404
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,040
WELL, I SAW THE PAPER
WITH MY VERY OWN EYES.

405
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,040
CARL SAID HE RECOGNIZED HIM
IN TOWN TODAY,

406
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,040
BUT I SAID
THAT WASN'T POSSIBLE

407
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,040
BECAUSE WE HADN'T EVEN COME
TO CALMEN IN THOSE DAYS.

408
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,040
BUT I'M SURE
YOU'RE VERY PLEASED.

409
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,520
JANEY, YOU GO ON OUTSIDE
AND PLAY FOR A BIT.

410
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,520
AND I BET YOU'RE PLEASED, TOO,
AREN'T YOU, LITTLE JANEY?

411
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,040
GO ON, JANEY.
GO ON OUTSIDE LIKE I TOLD YOU.

412
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,560
I ASSUME YOU'RE TALKING ABOUÒ
THE FACT THAT HARRY'S COME BACK.

413
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,040
OH, YES, OF COURSE.

414
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,560
MAYBE WE'LL SEE YOU IN TOWN
AT THE QUILTINGS AND ALL.

415
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:09,040
FOLKS ARE ALWAYS SAYING WHAT
A PITY YOU NEVER GET INTO TOWN.

416
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,560
MRS. SORENSON, I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT HE WAS COMING BACK,

417
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,560
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG HE'LL STAY.

418
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,560
I DON'T WANT JANEY UPSET.

419
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:20,080
SHE THINKS HER FATHER'S DEAD.

420
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:24,560
IF SHE FINDS OUT DIFFERENT,
AND IF HE GOES OFF AGAIN -

421
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,080
HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

422
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,560
DIDN'T HE SHOW YOU WHAT HE WROTE?

423
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,560
NAILED IT UP ALL OVER TOWN.

424
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,600
"NO FURTHER NEED OF HIRED HELP,"
IT SAID.

425
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,320
A MAN THAT DOES THAT ISN'T
THINKING OF GOING NOWHERE.

426
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,360
YOUR HUSBAND ISN'T AROUND?

427
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,960
I'D SO LIKE TO MEET HIM.

428
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,480
CARL AND I WERE STILL
IN PHILADELPHIA THEN.

429
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,480
NO.

430
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,240
HE'S OUT ON THE FARM.

431
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,720
OH, I SEE.

432
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,240
WELL, I JUST DROPPED BY
TO SAY HELLO.

433
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,240
WE'LL BE LOOKING FOR YOU
IN TOWN.

434
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:12,240
FOLKS WILL BE LOOKING OUT NOW
THAT YOUR MAN'S COME HOME.

435
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,760
GOODBYE, MRS. SORENSON.

436
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,760
GOODBYE, MRS. COLLINGS.

437
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,240
OH, AND GIVE MY VERY BEST
TO MR.COLLINGS.

438
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:22,760
THANK YOU.

439
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,400
YOU KNOW THAT HE WANTS
TO STAY HERE.

440
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,400
I GATHERED THAT.

441
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,400
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT IT?

442
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,920
THAT AIN'T FOR ME TO THINK.

443
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,440
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ME HANGING AROUND.

444
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,920
YOU PROBABLY THINK
I'M PRETTY HARD.

445
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,400
NOW, MA'AM,
THAT'S NOT FOR ME TO DECIDE.

446
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,400
WELL, I AM.

447
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:22,840
DON'T WANNA BE, BUT I AM.

448
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:28,360
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY NIGHTS
I SAT ON THE PORCH,

449
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:33,880
ROCKING MYSELF BACK AND FORTH,
WATCHING THE SHED,

450
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:37,440
HOPING WHOEVER WAS IN THERE
WOULD COME OUT...

451
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,920
HOPING AND TERRIFIED
IN CASE HE DID.

452
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:49,840
IT WAS ALL RIGHT
AT THE TIME --

453
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:54,800
OUT IN THE FIELDS
OR IN THE HAY.

454
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,440
SOMETIMES,
JUST DOWN ON THE DIRT.

455
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,920
THAT'S RIGHT.

456
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,360
YOU CAN TELL, CAN'T YOU?

457
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:11,840
WOULDN'T REALLY MATTER WHETHER
IT WAS YOU OR HIM TONIGHT.

458
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,800
DO YOU THINK
HE'LL BE HAPPY HERE?

459
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,640
THERE WILL BE TIMES
WHEN HE'LL BE HAPPY.

460
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,960
IF YOU REALLY WANT HIM, MA'AM...

461
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,280
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TELL HIM.

462
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,080
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TELL YOURSELF, TOO.

463
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,760
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING, ARCH?

464
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,760
WHAT'S THIS
ABOUT HEADING WEST?

465
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,760
WELL, YOU'RE SETTLED
IN HERE NOW, HARRY.

466
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,280
I THOUGHT I'D GO BACK
TO OUR OLD PLAN --

467
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,760
GOING OUT TO CALIFORNIA.

468
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,800
BUT YOU LIKE IT HERE.
I KNOW YOU DO.

469
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,880
HE SUITS IT HERE,
DOESN'T HE?

470
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,880
RECKON IF ARCH
WANTS TO GO ON,

471
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,360
WE SHOULDN'T ARGUE WITH HIM.

472
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:51,640
IT'S BETTER THIS WAY, HARRY.

473
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,120
BEST THING.

474
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,120
YOU REALLY WANT TO GO
TO CALIFORNIA, ARCH?

475
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,640
SEE THAT OCEAN?

476
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,640
SURE DO.

477
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:09,640
I WOULDN'T SAY SO IF I DIDN'T.

478
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,680
OKAY, ARCH,
IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU WANT IT.

479
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:36,000
I THINK THIS IS
HOW IT HAS TO BE, HARRY.

480
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,680
DID YOU ASK HIM TO GO?

481
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,720
NO, I NEVER DID.

482
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,400
BUT YOU WANT HIM TO,
DON'T YOU?

483
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,840
I WANT YOU TO STAY.
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

484
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,840
BUT I WILL STAY.
I TOLD YOU SO.

485
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:57,360
WITH ME, BECAUSE OF ME --
ME AND JANEY.

486
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,880
WELL, THAT'S WHY
I CAME BACK, AIN'T IT?

487
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:00,880
PARTLY.

488
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,440
PARTLY BECAUSE YOU WERE TIRED,

489
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,960
SICK AND WEARY OF HAVING NO
PLACE BUT THE GROUND TO SLEEP.

490
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:12,560
HARRY, I'M ALL ACHING AND SORE
FROM THESE LAST SIX YEARS.

491
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,560
I FEEL I'M GONNA SPLIT OPEN.

492
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:20,040
I'M SCARED TO THINK IT MIGHT
ALL COME RIGHT AGAIN

493
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,960
AFTER ALL THIS TIME.

494
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:26,000
I DON'T BELIEVE IT,
BUT I WANT IT TO BE.

495
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,960
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

496
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,080
I GUESS SO, HANNAH.

497
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:38,600
THAT MAN OUT THERE,
HE'S A DECENT MAN, I'M SURE.

498
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:44,240
BUT HE'S HAD MORE OF YOU
THAN I'VE EVER KNOWN.

499
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:48,320
HE'S WHAT YOU LEFT ME FOR, HARRY.

500
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,840
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T KNOW HIM
WHEN YOU LEFT,

501
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,320
BUT HE'S WHAT YOU WENT LOOKING FOR.

502
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:58,880
A MAN DON'T ASK THE THINGS OF
ANOTHER MAN LIKE A WOMAN DOES.

503
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,360
HE'S EASIER TO PLEASE,

504
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,360
AND HE DON'T GET BITTER
ABOUT THE SAME THINGS.

505
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,360
EACH TIME YOU AND ME
DIDN'T GET ALONG,

506
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:10,400
EACH TIME YOU GOT WEARY,
HE'D BE THERE,

507
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,400
AND I'D WONDER IF YOU WERE
PLANNING TO GO OFF WITH HIM

508
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,880
OR IF HE'D BE TELLING YOU
NOT TO BE A FOOL.

509
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,920
DON'T YOU SEE, HARRY?

510
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,960
IT'D BE JUST LIKE
YOU CAME HOME

511
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,960
WITH SOME WOMAN
YOU'D BEEN LIVING WITH

512
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,440
AND SAID, "I WANT HER TO STAY
IN THE SPARE ROOM."

513
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,040
OUT THERE WHERE HE'S GOING, HANNAH,

514
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,080
IT'S COLD ON YOUR OWN.

515
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,120
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME

516
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:26,480
YOU STARTED PRACTICING BEING
A HUSBAND AGAIN, HARRY?

517
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,200
I'LL PICK IT UP OKAY.

518
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,040
GOOD NIGHT, HARRY.

519
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:21,720
SURE IS A GOOD MORNING FOR IT.

520
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:41,120
YOU MAKE IT BACK THIS WAY...

521
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,120
SURE.

522
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,760
ARCH...

523
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:58,400
...IF IT GETS, WELL, YOU KNOW,
THE WAY IT CAN OUT THERE,

524
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,400
YOU JUST TURN AROUND.

525
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:05,280
I'LL BRING YOU BACK
A BOTTLE OF THAT OCEAN WATER.

526
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,920
GOODBYE, MR. HARRIS.

527
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:24,400
BYE, JANEY.

528
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:30,800
I HOPE I'LL BE ALL RIGHT
FOR YOU, HARRY.

529
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,960
JUST CHECKING JANEY.

530
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,480
SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

531
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,960
WIND DIDN'T WAKEN HER.

532
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,480
I LOVE YOU, HARRY.

533
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,480
I LOVE YOU, TOO, HANNAH.

534
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
HARRY!

535
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,520
HARRY, THERE'S A FUNNY MAN,

536
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,520
AND HE BROUGHT
MR. HARRIS' HORSE BACK.

537
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,960
WHERE'D YOU GET THIS HORSE?

538
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,680
SAM SENT ME WITH IT.

539
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:35,720
WHERE'S HARRIS?

540
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:39,200
HE WANTS YOU TO COME SEE HIM.

541
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,200
WHERE IS HE?

542
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,720
WAITING FOR YOU.

543
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,200
WHAT IS IT, HARRY?

544
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,720
IT'S ARCH.
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

545
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:50,600
IS HE SICK?

546
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,600
NOT EXACTLY.

547
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:56,080
HE SENT YOU... THIS.

548
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:10,360
SAM SAYS EACH WEEK
YOU DON'T SHOW UP,

549
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,360
HE'S GONNA TAKE OFF ANOTHER.

550
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,840
AND IF YOU
DON'T SHOW UP EVER,

551
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,880
HE'S GONNA CUT OFF HIS TOES AND ALL.

552
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,760
HARRY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

553
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,280
THEY CUT OFF
ONE OF ARCH'S FINGERS.

554
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,640
ONE EACH WEEK, THEY SAY,
TILL I GET THERE.

555
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,640
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT'S HIS FINGER?

556
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,640
IT SURE AS HELL IS
SOMEBODY'S FINGER,

557
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,640
AND SEEING AS THEY GOT ARCH,
I RECKON IT'S HIS, OKAY?

558
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:16,320
HARRY, YOU CAN'T.

559
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,680
YOU CAME BACK, YOU SAID.

560
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:25,440
YOU SAID YOU'D COME BACK.
YOU CAN'T GO AWAY, YOU CAN'T.

561
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:29,320
THE LONGER I WAIT, THE WORSE
IT'LL BE FOR HIM, HANNAH.

562
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,320
I DON'T CARE ABOUT HIM!

563
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:34,320
I CARE ABOUT ME AND JANEY AND YOU!

564
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,920
YOU NEVER MEANT TO STAY.
YOU NEVER!

565
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:39,960
YOU PLANNED IT, THE TWO OF YOU.

566
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,560
YOU PLANNED IT!

567
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:43,960
IT'S YOUR WAY
OF GETTING AWAY AGAIN.

568
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:44,960
YOU PLANNED IT!

569
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,200
THAT'S NOT TRUE, HANNAH.

570
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,200
I HAVE TO GO.

571
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,600
ARCH IS IN THIS TROUBLE
BECAUSE OF ME.

572
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,440
I HAVE TO GET HIM OUT OF IT.

573
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,960
AND WHEN THAT'S DONE,
I'LL BE BACK,

574
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,960
AND THINGS WILL BE RIGHT.

575
01:14:57,080 --> 01:15:01,080
YOU WON'T COME BACK,
I KNOW IT.

576
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,080
YOUR DISCARD, YOU KNOW THAT.

577
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,360
B?SAME LAS PATAS.

578
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,840
MAGDALENA!

579
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:17,600

01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,200

01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:18,200
POR FAVOR.

583
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,840
COME ON.

584
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,320
COME ON!

585
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:25,720
COME ON, COME ON.

586
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:35,240
Come here.
Give me a little water.

587
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:38,720
Yeah, that's -
- That's all right.

588
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,120
AHH.

589
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,360
PARA QU? VINISTES?

590
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:57,360
ESE HOMBRE PENDEJO
TE QUIERE MATAR.

591
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,600

01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,600

Y AHORA TE QUIERE

594
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,880
GIVE ME A GUN.

595
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:13,120
A PISTOL!

596
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:17,400
NO. A M?, M?TAME, NO.

597
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,400
I'LL KILL HIM.

598
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,400
I'LL KILL HIM!

599
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,040
A M?, M?TAME.

600
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,600
SACQUE DE AQU?!

601
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,360
PISTOL.

602
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:23,280
YOU CAN COUNT
YOUR FINGERS NOW.

603
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,800
YOUR FRIEND'S
COME TO GET YOU.

604
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,320
MIGHTY GOOD TO SEE YOU.

605
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:46,920
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
PRETTY HARD FOR YOU...

606
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,440
AND THAT'S DIFFICULT,

607
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:51,920
SEEING IT'S VERY HARD FOR ME
TO GET ABOUT.

608
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,680
WHERE'S HARRIS?

609
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:54,680
HE'S HERE.

610
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,680
YOU RID HARD.

611
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,680
YOU SAVED HIM A FINGER.

612
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,680
THEY'RE BAD ONES, HARRY.

613
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:33,680
I KNEW IT.

614
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:38,160
FIRST TIME WE WAS HERE...

615
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:40,160
I HAD A FEELING.

616
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:43,160
THEN, WHEN WE RODE OUT,

617
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,680
THOUGHT IT WAS ALL LEFT BEHIND.

618
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,800
OH.

619
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,800
HOLD ME, ARCH.

620
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Vesko
