1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,806
To my father, in the heavenly stables

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,801
Far away from the capital city,
country life has perished.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,806
Criminal gangs occupy abandoned farms,
bringing back slavery.

4
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,886
Present

5
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,804
in co-production with

6
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,403
with the support of

7
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,009
MIRAGE

8
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,803
I want to go to the tavern.

9
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,084
300 forints.

10
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,884
You'll have to wait a bit.

11
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,209
Good morning!

12
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,489
Thank you very much!

13
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,206
Mister, wake up!

14
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,010
Radio Kossuth, Budapest.

15
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,209
The current time is noon.

16
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,684
This is it.

17
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,808
We'll have to bury him.

18
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,405
It's hot...

19
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,406
There's another spade in there!

20
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,489
Open the door!

21
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,209
Come out with your hands up!

22
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,606
Stop there!

23
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,084
Close the door!

24
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,284
Turn around and face the wall!

25
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,802
Frisk him.

26
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,209
Open the bag.

27
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,609
Hands up and turn back to the wall!

28
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,404
Do you speak Hungarian?

29
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,289
A bit.

30
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,009
Turn around!

31
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,687
Hands!

32
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,609
Wait!

33
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,409
What's going on?

34
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,886
What have you caught?

35
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,008
He just arrived on the train.

36
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,207
Aha... and what's the problem?

37
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,886
He's on the run for taking bribes
and match-fixing. Do you know him?

38
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,811
Come here.

39
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,211
Who?

40
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,802
You.

41
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,609
Me?

42
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,603
I'm not talking to myself!

43
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,490
Come on.

44
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,404
Come on.

45
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,081
You stay there!

46
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,204
Let me tell you how we'll do.

47
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,001
Give him the key.

48
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,484
We know you come tomorrow!

49
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,886
But Cisco: "No, no he comes today!"

50
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,603
"He comes today!“

51
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,802
He was right.

52
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,881
Cisco...

53
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,887
<i>Cisco knows, he feels.</i>

54
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,804
Do you understand what I'm saying?

55
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,287
Do you understand me?

56
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,601
I understand you.

57
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,201
Me Kokas.

58
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,487
- Francis.
- What?

59
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,084
Francis!

60
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,003
Hello, Francis.

61
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,289
Football player?

62
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,490
I'm sure you can fucking hear me!

63
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,401
Why not...

64
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,803
Why not West?

65
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,009
Big team.

66
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,087
Or America like Beckham.

67
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,089
Drogba is better.

68
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,086
Do you know Hagi?

69
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,009
Steaua.

70
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,607
Steaua Bucuresti! Steaua...

71
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,409
Number one!

72
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,085
Striker, jersey number ten.

73
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,604
Is it far?

74
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,884
No, no. It's close.

75
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,809
The farm... close.

76
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,481
But...

77
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,207
...you can't see because...

78
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,204
It's the fucking Puszta!

79
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,481
Treacherous country this...

80
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,400
It looks ﬂat, but there are potholes so big
you could hide a tank in them!

81
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,805
French is the official language
in the Ivory Coast, isn't it?

82
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,804
Yes, why?

83
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,404
Sunglasses off!

84
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,406
And you.

85
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,011
I see you like it here.

86
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,004
Things could be worse...
But then they'd be much worse.

87
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,890
Who said you could leave the vehicle?

88
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,611
Nobody said I couldn't.

89
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,610
Can we take a look in your bag?

90
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,881
Hands up!

91
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,602
Don't drink from the well, ifs not drinkable.

92
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,609
Bad, bad water!

93
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,211
This is the shower, that's how you say
it in French, right?

94
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,611
Shower gel.

95
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,887
There's...

96
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,286
Don't go there!

97
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,489
Good water inside.

98
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,280
Good water, you can drink this.

99
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,805
Don't drink from the well.

100
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,289
Here, cold water.

101
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,804
And cola no... It's Cisco's cola!

102
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,282
Meat, all you want.

103
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,403
Cigarettes... free.

104
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,611
Come on!

105
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,884
Thank you.

106
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,009
So, this is it...

107
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,090
...and tomorrow
either you bore or you work.

108
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,601
Hammer!

109
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,089
Please, show me a bed.

110
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,409
Fuck off!

111
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,081
Ready?

112
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,606
Didn't you have anything colder?

113
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,801
Come on!

114
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,286
It is cold.

115
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,889
Everyone stay where you are!
Get your ID papers ready!

116
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,011
Have a look around!

117
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,201
Give it here! Give me the gun!

118
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,009
To the wall! Come on!

119
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,082
You don't have to work so hard.

120
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,401
There's no need to rush.

121
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,282
It's enough to do it
when they're watching.

122
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:14,003
If they see you can chop this much in one day,
they'll have us all doing it tomorrow.

123
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,206
Understand?

124
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,282
I'm asking you for us all
not to fuck things up for us!

125
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,482
"This farm used to belong to my family.
These men just came and took over.

126
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,802
Make them leave.
Make them disappear from the..."

127
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,087
...surface.

128
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,804
What the fuck are you doing in here?!

129
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,806
What are you doing here? Get out!

130
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,087
Hurry up! Move 'rt!

131
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,886
Get out!

132
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,409
Get up!

133
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,401
Move, move!

134
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,284
Faster!

135
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,282
Faster, you dogs!

136
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,687
Go to fucking work!

137
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,806
I heard a knocking noise.

138
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,611
Is it the half shaft?

139
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,006
I hope not...

140
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,610
These fucking plains have damaged the truck
more than any other roads we've been on!

141
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,091
Going somewhere, are we?

142
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,611
You forgot to give my papers back.

143
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,091
I didn't forget.

144
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,602
I must have misunderstood something then.

145
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,803
That's more than likely.

146
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,684
I want to go back. I've changed my mind.

147
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,886
Okay.

148
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,280
We'll take you back when they says so.

149
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,408
Until then, you're not going anywhere.

150
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,282
Don't even think about escaping.

151
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,487
You'll never find your way out of here,
not unless you've got wings.

152
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,887
One of us isn't normal.

153
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,289
That's possible.

154
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,090
Did you see anything?

155
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,284
Did you see anything?

156
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,008
No, I don't think so.

157
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,006
Go away! Get the hell out of here!

158
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,481
Go away! Get the hell out of here!

159
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,006
Fuck off!

160
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:42,491
We also have a monkey!
We also have a monkey!

161
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,405
Come on, come on for God's sake.

162
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,286
Take him!

163
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,683
Go clean the stables,
the shit is up to your knees.

164
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,806
Where's the ball?

165
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:09,007
Hey, you're here at last.
Have a good rest?

166
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,286
Where's my ball?

167
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,202
What ball?

168
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,409
What the fuck happened?

169
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,809
He attacked the geese.

170
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,407
- Jackal?
- Yes.

171
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,891
Did you shoot it?

172
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,682
Maybe they are more.

173
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,001
You really don't feel it?

174
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,404
How can you exist here?
You don't feel it?

175
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,884
How can you sleep in here?
There's no air!

176
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,008
Open the door.

177
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,290
My head's splitting.
Bring me some tablets.

178
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,402
Didn't I tell you not to wander around
in your panties?

179
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,004
- There's nobody here...

180
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,604
- I'm here.

181
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,202
I told you!

182
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,886
What's this?

183
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,011
Thanks.

184
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,408
Stand up!

185
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,006
Are you deaf?
Stand up!

186
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,411
Stand up!

187
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,482
What the fuck's wrong with you?

188
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,689
Stand up and get back to fucking work!

189
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,002
Do you want me to get off the horse?

190
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,483
I told you to go back to fucking work,
so why don't you stand up?

191
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,482
What's wrong with you?

192
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,210
Hurry up, snowball! Get them moving!
Do you hear me?

193
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,082
What the fuck are you doing, Tomi?!
Go after the geese!

194
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:50,482
Hurry up! I don't want to see
any feathers here in half an hour!

195
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,404
You stay here!

196
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:34,681
What did he do?

197
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,205
He hit somebody with a car.

198
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,804
So what? And?

199
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,481
I think he killed him.

200
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,891
Oh dear!

201
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,682
What's his job?

202
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,886
Taxi driver.

203
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,611
Okay.

204
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,011
Then take care of him.

205
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,402
You know what you have to do.

206
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,084
Sure, boss.

207
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,286
Hey, ...

208
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,481

209
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,290

210
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,011
Your shirt, ifs cool!

211
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,002
Go fuck yourself!

212
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:04,609
There was a ball in the wardrobe.
You haven't seen it, have you?

213
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,609
What ball?

214
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,684
A football.

215
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,204
It was at the bottom, covered with a towel.

216
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,406
Covered?

217
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,289
- Did you see it?
- No.

218
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,606
- What were you doing in the bathroom?
- When?

219
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,888
Last night!
What was that screwdriver doing in the toilet?

220
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,689
I don't know.

221
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,608
- And then?
- What?

222
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:47,601
Where's the ball?

223
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,090
- I told you I don't know.
- No?

224
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,206
- No.
- Are you sure?

225
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:50,689
Yes.

226
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,001
Where did you two put the ball?

227
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,207
Where did you two put the ball?

228
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,282
- Who?
- You know who!

229
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:06,089
Where's the ball?

230
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,088
Oh, baby. Please, stop it.

231
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,604
Okay.

232
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,210
Stinking fucking animal!

233
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,891
Fuck it!

234
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,889
Give me the honey.

235
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,090
I'll give you some time to think about it, okay?

236
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,687
Just call if you remember!

237
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:39,485
So what happened?
Do you remember now?

238
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,881
What are we gonna do?

239
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:45,009
I told you, I don't know.

240
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,807
Where did you put it?

241
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:49,611
Tell me, I'm getting angry...

242
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,682
Where did you put the ball?
Don't you understand?

243
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,409
- Answer me.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

244
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,289
You don't know what I am talking about'?!

245
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,084
The cow's pregnant.

246
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,482
You need to come for a minute.

247
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,409
I don't know,maybe there is somebody
in the car too.

248
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,290
I don't know.
