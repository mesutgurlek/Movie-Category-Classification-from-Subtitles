00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,471

4
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,313
<i>Made of solid timber</i>

5
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,789
<i>She set her sights and fought her fights</i>

6
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,713
<i>Cos justice was her aim</i>

7

<i>And a rebel county</i>
<i>has never been the same</i>

8
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,592
<i>She didn't wear no fancy duds</i>

9
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,194
<i>And worked like any man</i>

10
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,317
<i>She faced a lot of danger</i>

11
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,960
<i>And still she never ran</i>

12
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,239
<i>For Josie had some ideas</i>
<i>and every day she'd use them</i>

13
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,029
<i>And she also had some rough words</i>

14
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,908
<i>In case she had to use them</i>

Luther.

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,436
(Woman screams)

27
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,670
Get goin'.

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,955
Luther.

29
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,233
We've had all of you
we can handle of you for tonight.

30
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,995
- Take your hands off me.
- Any more and you'll spend the night in jail.

31
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,039
Now get on home to your wife.
And stay there.

32
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,834
All right, back inside, everybody.

33
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,878
You've seen Whit Minick
go through a window before.

34
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,235
(Footsteps approach)

35
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,838
He's on his way, Ma.

36
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,314
Ooh, sorry!

37
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,636
On you go.

38
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,995
(Man, slurring) Josie! Open the door!

39
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,116
(Banging on door)

40
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,071
Josie!

41
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,436
Any time, Whit Minick.

42
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,273
Any time.

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,592
You keep away from me.

44
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,629
- (Crashing)
- (Whit) Watch what you're doing!

45
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,996
- (Josie) Stop it!
- I've only had a few!

46
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,389
- Stop it!
- All right, Josie.

47
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,198
No! Don't break the...

48
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,513
Whit, stop it!

49
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,036
Josie, open that door!

50
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,317
Do you hear me?
This is your husband speaking.

51
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,312
Will you open that door?

52
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,511
Whit!

53
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,474
Whit, get up.

54
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,790
- Evening, Fonse.
- Howdy.

55
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,475
Whit, will you please get up there?

56
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,669
Whit.

57
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,550
We are gathered here today to say goodbye

58
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,873
to one who has wandered in our midst
for a decade or more

59
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,669
as a friend and a fellow citizen,

60
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,149
Whit Minick.

61
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:27,998
We offer our sympathy to Whit's father here
in his hour of grief,

62
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,598
to the Widow Minick and her poor little boy.

63
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,514
We're here to say goodbye to Whit.

64
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,470
I recall Whit Minick the man.

65
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,519
Why, I can see Whit as if it was yesterday,

66
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,479
stagger... er... walking down Main Street,

67
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,233
kind of a grin on his face.

68
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,519
Whit would pass
and I'd turn to Whit and say, "Hi, Whit,"

69
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:02,072
and he'd say, "Hi" and be on his way,

70
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,799
but that was Whit for you.

71
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,112
One always liquo...
Er, one that was always ready to say hi.

72
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,078
Look at them all sweat
trying to make up their minds.

73
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,155
- Why, there wasn't a...
- About what?

74
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,357
Whether to put her in jail
or pay her a bounty.

75
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,431
It can go either way.

76
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,478
I can hear him now.

77
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,876
"Hi." Amen.

78
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,032
- How is she doing?
- Not crying, not smiling either.

79
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,319
She must feel terrible. Not having a man is
bad enough. To have one then lose him...

80
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,870
You don't lose a man like Whit Minick.
You escape him.

81
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,919
Must have caught him coming in.
Timing had to be just right.

82
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,310
There he is, drunk as $700.

83
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,598
- Step in. Rotate hips.
- She lunges... Zip! Zam!

84
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,518
- Wow!
- Oh, girls, I give you Josie Minick!

85
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,230
But Miss Annabelle says you gotta eat, Ma.

86
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,550
Honey, Mama's not hungry.

87
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,756
Look what I brought you.

88
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,231
- You want it?
- Can I?

89
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,639
Mm-hm.

90
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,792
I'll take care of you, Ma.

91
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,429
Maybe go up to Little Bighorn
and fight Injuns.

92
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,557
(Man) As I was saying, gentlemen,
this is a matter of the law.

93
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,031
And it doesn't matter one way or the other
to the law at all

94
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,590
that Josie Minick had reached
the absolute end of her rope.

95
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,276
It doesn't matter to the law whether
she had suffered ten years or ten minutes

96
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,794
of misery at the hands of the deceased.

97
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,553
We all have to deal with a louse
now and then,

98
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,030
and it's the law that tells us
how far we can go

99
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,588
and where we have to stop.

100
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,912
I assure you that society itself
would crumble and fall

101
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,595
if we fail to stop
where the law says we must,

102
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,148
or if we try to take the law
into our own hands.

103
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,716
So I want you to forget
that Whit Minick was a louse.

104
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,749
He welched on his bets, he was
a miserable father and a worse husband.

105
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,991
I want you to forget all that.
Let's look at it this way.

106
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,390
You gentlemen are all married, most of you,

107
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,632
and the little woman is going
to get out of sorts every now and again.

108
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,950
It's bound to happen.

109
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,112
What would you do next time that happens

110
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,150
if the territory of Wyoming
allows her to pick up a pool cue, huh?

111
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,912
Guilty.

112
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,438
Not sure.

113
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,516
Not guilty.

114
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,910
One guilty, one not guilty, six not sure.

115
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,436
- All right, I'm the guilty.
- And I'm the not guilty.

116
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,318
Only man with any guts on this jury is me.

117
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,518
It beats me how you and I can cow-ranch
next to each other all these years

118
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,512
and never a cross word
and never agree on a damn thing.

119
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,909
I've got a bull I don't agree with either

120
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,639
but it ain't worth my time
to try to convert him.

121
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,871
(Laughs)

122
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,914
Well, what do we do now?

123
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,791
We get down to cases.

124
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,158
Whatever the verdict, Mrs Minick, the
question of Luther will still have to be faced.

125
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,914
Let us recognise certain facts.

126
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,878
I've been your sole support for ten years,

127
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,351
and my obligations to my grandson
are somewhat different than to you.

128
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,879
Mr Minick, we don't need your obligations.

129
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,111
I have two hands and a house
and I am willing...

130
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,760
There's nothing wrong with your two hands.

131
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,593
But mine happen to hold the mortgage
on that house.

132
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,877
So until and unless you are able
to provide for Luther,

133
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,794
I think he'll be better off with me
in Cheyenne and the court will agree.

134
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,078
- Judge!
- I'm afraid he's right, Josie.

135
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,798
That's the way it's got to be.

136
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,713
But I think it's foolish chewing on all this

137
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,918
before we've decided
whether she's gonna go to jail or not.

138
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,389
I think we'd better get back in there.

139
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,711
Fonse.

140
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,268
You were peeking at my hand, Doc.

141
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,194
Not guilty. Not sure.

142
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,829
Not sure. Not guilty.

143
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,310
Two guilty and four not guilty
and two not sure. We're gaining.

144
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,868
I ain't gonna vote to hang no woman.

145
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,155
Who in the heck says
we're gonna hang her?

146
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,834
You vote guilty, you're gonna hang her.

147
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,038
We ain't gonna hang nobody. Not even you.

148
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,908
All we're gonna do is put her away
in the pokey for a couple of weeks.

149
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,468
For what good reason?
The man needed killing.

150
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,596
- Now who says?
- Now you says.

151
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,038
You called Whit Minick a welcher and
a wife-beater and a yellow-livered coyote.

152
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,511
- And everybody heard you, too.
- Wouldn't have hit him with no pool cue.

153
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,751
You can't fault a man
for jostling his woman round a little bit.

154
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,913
A woman needs it now and then.
There's a principle involved.

155
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,116
You're not the only one with principles.

156
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,395
- I...
- Er... gents?

157
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,352
The judge says you can't get a verdict
by six o'clock,

158
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,238
we're gonna take you to supper
at the Trail's End.

159
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,309
(Judge) Court will come to order.

160
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,475
Don't count your chickens
before they're hatched.

161
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,269
- You may like it in Cheyenne.
- I won't like Cheyenne.

162
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,989
I like it here.
Don't they think you can take care of me?

163
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,038
Of course they do, Luther.

164
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,875
It's just that until Mama gets settled,
you're better off with Grandpa.

165
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,433
Whoa.

166
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,119
We could go to Montana and fight Injuns.

167
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,510
We could go cow-ranching at Willow Creek.

168
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,068
I can ride, and I could learn to rope.

169
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,475
It's Grandpa. I'll think about it, sweetheart.

170
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,636
I assume you'll be staying here
for the time being at least.

171
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,552
Yes, sir.

172
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,156
In an emergency, I'm only half a day away.
Please remember that.

173
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,515
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

174
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,160
- Come on, Luther.
- Goodbye.

175
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,274
You be a good boy for Mama.
Be a good boy.

176
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,196
I love you.

177
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,236
(Clicks tongue)

178
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,633
Remember Willow Creek.

179
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,480
"Pay to Josephine Minick, the sum of..."

180
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,358
$1,000 is kind of an awkward sum.

181
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,716
It's too big to fritter away
and too little to really go to hell on.

182
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,110
It made good sense for your husband's pa
to take out insurance.

183
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,668
It's a wise father that knows his own son.

184
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,070
You know what I'd do with this?
I'd buy me a $40 corset,

185
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,469
a perky French bonnet and a new dress.

186
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,757
And then I would go down to Denver
and join all 46 churches.

187
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,310
Bet you 16 to three
that I'd have a man by snow time.

188
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,029
- You already got one.
- It's an unmentionable arrangement.

189
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,430
All the comforts
and none of the responsibilities.

190
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:31,310
You are so jealous you are
purely grinding your back teeth down.

191
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,030
Just the same, if I had to spend
ten years with Whit Minick...

192
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,236
Well, let's face facts.

193
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,675
She either stays here and knits tea cosies

194
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,558
and joins my committee
to work for women's rights,

195
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,870
or she can hunt up another man.

196
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,714
There's just two ways to... go.

197
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,400
Sure was a surprise to me.

198
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,155
- All dressed up...
- No place to go. Sad thing.

199
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,037
- Sure is.
- Mm-hm.

200
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,759
Look out!

201
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,478
(Squeals)

202
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,150
Ed, I need that horse and buggy.

203
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,674
I'm sorry, Miss Josie, it's the law.

204
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,230
- But what am I supposed to do?
- You in trouble with the law again?

205
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,437
I seem to be. He can't give me
my horse and buggy.

206
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,796
Probate or some such.
I don't know the fancy words.

207
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,872
If I did, I wouldn't be
busting my back around here.

208
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,836
I wanted to go to our place at Willow Creek.

209
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,831
I thought Whit let that go.

210
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:06,153
No, he wanted to,
but it was half mine and I wouldn't let him.

211
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,950
Well... if it ain't Josie Minick.

212
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,996
Mr Ogden.

213
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,799
Congratulations. Where are you going?

214
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,192
Up to Willow Creek. Gonna stop by
and have a look at Josie's spread.

215
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,955
Up you go.

216
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,629
What you gonna do out on Willow Creek?

217
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,598
- Raise beef.
- Now don't josh me.

218
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,036
A woman's got to turn her hand
to something, with a boy to raise.

219
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,112
- You're gonna be neighbours.
- He's pulling my leg.

220
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,632
I think.

221
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,275
What are you up to out at Willow Creek?

222
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,352
Oh, I just thought I'd go out and take
a look around. It's been a long time.

223
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,517
- Nice, isn't it?
- (Sighs)

224
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,149
I kind of forgot what spring was like
in the country.

225
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,596
I guess you didn't get a chance
to get out here too often.

226
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,516
You got any plans, Josie?

227
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,114
No. Not really.

228
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,274
I don't think it's gonna do you any good
sitting around Annabelle's with the girls.

229
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,158
Got any suggestions?

230
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,038
No, but I'll think on it if you want me to.

231
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,393
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Here it is.

232
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,634
It's a nice place, Josie.

233
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,393
Oh, it could have been.

234
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,870
We just never really got it started, Jase.

235
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,836
We built the house, proved it up...

236
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,396
and then...

237
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,832
Yeah, I know.

238
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,912
(Sighs) Come on.

239
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,676
- Whoa...
- Thank you.

240
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:55,151
Oh, Jase! Oh, look at this mess!

241
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,516
Some saddle tramp's
been taking advantage of your hospitality.

242
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,716
Every winter.

243
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,394
Oh, dear, it's filthy!

244
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,232
Josie, you know, those cows out there
belong to Arch Ogden.

245
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,470
He surrounds you on three sides

246
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,678
and he's had his eye on this patch of ground
for a while, he needs the grazing space.

247
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,992
If you go about it just right,
you can get a good price out of him.

248
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,275
I hadn't thought about selling, Jase.

249
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,590
What are you going to do with it?

250
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,639
There's no reason I can't use it
for the same purpose, is there?

251
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,278
- Grazing space?
- Uh-huh.

252
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,717
- For what?
- For cows. My own cows.

253
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,837
- Your own cows?
- That's right.

254
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:43,074
- A woman running a cow ranch? (Laughs)
- What's so wrong about that?

255
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,119
You didn't take me seriously.
I was just kidding Arch about what I said.

256
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,078
I know that, Jase.
It was Luther's idea. It was.

257
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,676
He said to me, "Mama, we can either
go to Montana and fight Injuns,

258
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,672
"or we can raise cows at Willow Creek."

259
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,548
- And this seems to be the most practical.
- Not by much, it isn't.

260
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,474
What do you mean, not by much?
There's no reason why I can't have...

261
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,109
There are a lot of reasons
why you can't have your own cows

262
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,077
and one day we'll talk about them...

263
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,038
- There's no time like the present.
- <i>...</i>but I have to go.

264
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,791
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah, I got friends coming for supper.

265
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,795
Supper? Well, we'd better get a move on.

266
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,599
Well, we don't have to gallop at it, you know.

267
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,996
I'm sorry, Jase. You should have told me
you had company coming.

268
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,550
- That doesn't matter.
- It's out of your way to take me back.

269
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:43,829
No, it's nothing special. It's just a dull
political meeting. Wyoming statehood.

270
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,629
Hey, do you mind
a little cigar smoke and politics?

271
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,269
To tell you the truth, it sounds awful.

272
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,989
I'll feed you better than Annabelle,
and that's a guarantee.

273
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,719
- That sounds good.
- (Chuckles)

274
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,954
- You're sure I won't be in the way now?
- No, they're all your friends too.

275
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,793
Giddup! Giddup!

276
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,430
Yes, sir, there's nothing like a pretty woman
to cheer up a dull political meeting.

277
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,194
- I understand why you're upset about...
- I'm not upset. They're upset.

278
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,509
- You're not mad about that trial?
- Of course not.

279
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,512
Never pay too much attention
to what a prosecutor says.

280
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,194
If I don't make the right noises,

281
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,396
they figure I haven't earned my pay.

282
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,110
I never tried a case I wanted to lose as
much as that one. I want you to know that.

283
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,272
- He's all heart, that Charlie is.
- Jase!

284
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,638
- I don't want her feeding a grudge!
- Charlie, I'm not feeding a grudge.

285
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,474
I just want to find a way
to feed Luther and me, that's all.

286
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,597
Don't you worry.
We'll take care of you, Josie.

287
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,831
I don't want to be taken care of.
Don't you understand that?

288
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,038
Who's going to foreman for you?
Annabelle Pettijohn?

289
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,475
I don't think that's very funny, Mr Pruitt.

290
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,154
I didn't mean it to be. It ain't funny at all.

291
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,596
- It's nutty, that's what it is.
- Nutty?

292
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,955
- Nutty!
- Sheriff, so help me...

293
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,828
- Josie Minick, you remember your place.
- And what place is that?

294
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,070
It ain't on a cow ranch, for one thing.

295
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,879
What is so wrong
about a woman on a cow ranch?

296
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,714
- I'm strong and I'm able to do anything...
- Tut-tut-tut, Josie.

297
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,268
- Don't tut me.
- Stop...

298
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,399
Fonse, you're getting in over your head.
You don't know what we're talking about.

299
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,314
- Excuse me, Mr Meredith. Dinner is served.
- Thank you very much, Ben.

300
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,551
Josie? Shall we go on in, gentlemen?

301
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,995
Here we are.

302
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,280
- Oh, Fonse!
- Come on, Doc.

303
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,793
Nothing like a pretty woman
to cheer up a dull political meeting.

304
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,112
Josie, I had a notion that you might be able
to give us a woman's point of view

305
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,668
on a political question.

306
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,513
- Charlie, would you like to...
- Thank you, Jase.

307
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:20,038
Josie, we want the territory of Wyoming
to be admitted into the Union as a state.

308
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,069
Right. But to go in as a state,
we gotta get our ladies to give up the vote.

309
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,073
If we go in with the ladies voting,
the women in the other 43 states

310
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,072
are liable to get kinda jealous, you see?

311
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:37,029
So we have to ask our ladies to give up
the vote, just temporarily, you understand,

312
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,714
and then we'll give it back to them
once we get in.

313
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,110
Are you going to ask us or tell us?

314
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,830
- What kind of question is that?
- You told me to remember my place.

315
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,276
- I'm only asking.
- I was talking about cow-ranching.

316
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,793
Ahem. Yeah.

317
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,715
Well, Josie, the ladies have kind of got us
between a rock and a hard place.

318
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,678
Charlie here is going to Washington
to speak his piece,

319
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,514
but he wants to go feeling
he has the cooperation of the ladies.

320
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,478
- What do you think of our chances?
- Not much.

321
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,519
I'm getting fed up to the gills
with crusadin' females.

322
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,876
One thing you can't kick under the rug.
Women are people.

323
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,952
In this territory, women are also voters.

324
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,191
If you want to stay in office,
you've got to live with that.

325
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,113
If Josie Minick here
wants to go cow-ranching

326
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,714
or if she wants to fight Indians
at the Bighorn,

327
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,997
there's nothing in our constitution
says she can't do it.

328
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,470
- You'll tell them that in Washington?
- They already know it.

329
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,711
Annabelle sends them a telegram
every Friday.

330
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,439
You know what our motto is?

331
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,954
Cedant arma togae.

332
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,998
Let arms yield to the gown.

333
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,470
Go for it, Josie. Go forth and conquer.

334
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,269
The world is your oyster,
especially in Wyoming.

335
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,510
Thank you, Charlie.

336
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,474
Not enough room for both of us. Get going.

337
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,313
(Cow lowing)

338
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,597
Hi, Jase. That cow's been
bedded down in the back room.

339
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,035
Thinks she owns the place.

340
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,271
Say, I've got something to show you.
Watch this.

341
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,799
All it needed was priming. As good as new.

342
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:55,193
The roof's tight. Put new glass in
my windows for seven dollars. Come on in.

343
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,995
Come on.

344
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,110
Looks a little different, huh?

345
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,590
The floor's rotted out in a couple of places,
but I can fix that.

346
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,470
And when the court releases my furniture
I'm gonna have it all sent out from town.

347
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,357
Won't that be nice?

348
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,433
Oh, Jase, if I can just get this place to pay...

349
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,758
I'll have my son back soon.

350
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,714
Would you like some coffee?

351
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,193
Well, say hello to a pal of mine.
I've got a friend here I want you to meet.

352
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,078
She lives under the floor.
She won't hurt you.

353
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,390
Got an owl in the attic, too.

354
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,710
I'll get the coffee.

355
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,509
- It's a fine place you got here, Josie.
- Wait till you see it when...

356
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,831
It's a fine place for owls and skunks and...

357
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,436
But not for a fool woman who thinks
she can go cow-ranching all by herself.

358
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,355
- What did you say?
- You heard me. I said fool woman.

359
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,238
I do not intend to have you
cow-ranching alone,

360
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,675
not today or tomorrow or next year or ever.

361
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,318
- You don't intend?
- That's right.

362
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,119
Then just what do you want me to do, Jase?

363
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,078
Sit on a shelf at Annabelle Pettijohn's?

364
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,230
Or take upstairs employment at a saloon?

365
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,276
- I never said such a thing.
- I said it.

366
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,920
But you'd approve of that, wouldn't you?

367
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,151
It's all right for a woman
to take that kind of a job, isn't it?

368
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:30,439
To you, a woman is a... is a species of idiot,

369
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,433
to be kept in a back closet somewhere
and spoon-fed three times a day.

370
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,751
- That's what...
- Josie, that's enough. You listen to me.

371
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,037
I got no prejudice against women.
Not entirely, anyhow.

372
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,793
There are places women belong
and places they don't.

373
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,917
One of the places they don't is all alone
on a cattle spread,

374
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,117
with Indians, wolves,
drunk saddle tramps and cow thieves,

375
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,112
and roundups -
roping and branding and castrating.

376
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,112
Then there's blizzard kill,
Texas fever, loco weed,

377
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,317
bronc-busting and fence-mending
and a hundred other things

378
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,550
that would ruin a man, much less a woman.

379
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,270
- What do you mean, much less a woman?
- I ain't about to explain that to you.

380
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,478
But you're not going to blow $1,000
on beef and go ranching by yourself.

381
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,074
- It's my money and...
- And that's it!

382
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,799
Get out!

383
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,037
Damn!

384
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,515
Aaah!

385
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,716
Aaaaah!

386
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,873
Oh... (Sobs)

387
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,918
And I can help with the advertising.
I can take care of customers for you.

388
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,150
There's no limit to what I could do.

389
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,232
I just had a... thought.

390
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,438
My wife's in Omaha visiting her sister
and I'm alone...

391
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,991
Please, Mr Fremont.
I really do need this job.

392
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,352
- I'll work the first week for nothing.
- I got a better idea.

393
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,796
- How about you and I...
- Mr Fremont!

394
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,512
Hey, Josie, if all you want is a job, they need
a waitress down at the Trail's End!

395
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,513
- A woman? In a bank?
- Yes, sir.

396
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,038
- You mean handling the money and all?
- Oh, I'm true blue, Mr Hovitt.

397
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,635
- If you'll just give me a chance...
- Just thought of something.

398
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,518
Nick's looking for a waitress
down at the Trail's End.

399
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,112
Thank you.

400
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,959
- Got a great piece of news.
- I can have the job?

401
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,315
Slim Trent told me they need a waitress...

402
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,391
- At the Trail's End.
- You heard.

403
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,631
(Sighs) Yes, I heard. Thank you.

404
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,829
(Loud laughter)

405
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,590
(Man) Come on, bring those orders in.

406
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,674
I'll be right there.

407
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,917
I'm sorry!

408
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,275
Sorry!

409
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,834
I'm sorry.

410
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,957
- I'm sorry, Nick.
- You should be.

411
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,438
(Man) Piece of white cake
for the corner table.

412
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,115
Piece... Piece of white cake.

413
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,831
Coming.

414
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,749
Uh... Ow!

415
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,354
Ow!

416
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,118
Pick 'em up!

417
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,876
Oh!

418
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,558
I'm sorry.

419
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,238
You did real good, Josie.

420
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,030
Evening, Josie.

421
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,874
I see you got through your first day
in fine style.

422
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,793
- What's yours?
- Coffee.

423
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,677
Cream and sugar?

424
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,751
Real good waitress you got there, Nick.

425
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,428
(Baby cries)

426
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,590
Good morning.

427
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,798
I got a political meeting in Cheyenne
this afternoon.

428
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,032
If you're going in that direction
I'd be mighty proud to take you.

429
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,753
I'll take that, Josie. I've got it.

430
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,276
Ahem.

431
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,954
Looks like it's gonna be a long ride.

432
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,069
I'm sorry for blowing up at you like I did,
out at the ranch, I mean.

433
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,634
You know, they say that the admission
of ignorance is the beginning of wisdom.

434
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:24,157
I don't know a damn thing about women.
I never did. You gotta take that into account.

435
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,953
Well, I've said my apologies.

436
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,474
Well, I don't intend to say mine.

437
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,632
Cried all over my pillow
with what you did to me last night.

438
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,553
You got to admit,
you were pretty hard on me.

439
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,710
I meant to be.

440
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,475
Are you quitting, Josie?
Are you running off to Grandpa Alphie's?

441
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,676
Are you licked?

442
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,149
Maybe.

443
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,555
You know, I got some
fried chicken back here,

444
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,200
and I got a place in mind that we can eat it.

445
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,878
Mrs Minick, I just invited you
for some fried chicken.

446
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,430
- The least you could do is say yes or no.
- I'd be delighted.

447
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,120
Now that I think about it, it's not a good idea
to eat when you're all riled up.

448
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:29,797
When you get mad, all them juices churn
around down there something fierce.

449
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,112
The chicken will just sit there
and get soggy and lie there.

450
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,637
Oh, no. No, no. I wouldn't wanna...
I wouldn't wanna force any food on you

451
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,075
if your stomach's gonna fight it, mm-mm.

452
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,754
- Oh, no.
- I said I'd be delighted.

453
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,556
Whoa! Whoa!

454
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,592
- Here we are.
- Why are we stopping here?

455
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,433
This is where we're gonna have our picnic.
Come on.

456
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,229
There you are.

457
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,117
Oh, my goodness.

458
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,960
Look. Look at this.

459
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:19,470
Well, this, Mrs Minick,
is everything I had once.

460
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,313
This was my home
when I first came out here.

461
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,359
- The Indians burned me out.
- Really, Jase?

462
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,479
Mm-hm. Yeah.

463
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,838
I was kind of a colossal failure back in Ohio.

464
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,509
I took what I had left and I came out here.

465
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,352
With a woman.

466
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,798
And I sort of did it again.

467
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,236
She left me and I spent
the whole winter out here

468
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,869
with nothing to eat but snowshoe rabbits
and chicken mash.

469
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,759
But I stayed.

470
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:03,277
That's the important thing, isn't it?
You stayed.

471
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,191
Yeah, I guess so.

472
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,638
Well, I had good friends, too. You remember
old man Pettigrew in the bank?

473
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,358
- Mm-hm.
- He was one of them.

474
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:17,719
He gave me a cash loan. He didn't have to,
but he did and it got me back on my feet.

475
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,069
Do you know that
that's the first place I ever saw you?

476
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,390
In the bank.

477
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,029
- Your hair was different then.
- It was down, huh?

478
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,678
- Yes.
- Yeah.

479
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,958
And you had on a blue polka-dot dress
with a white collar

480
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,951
and it set off your yellow hair.

481
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,635
And your boy was with you.
He couldn't have been more than two then.

482
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,111
And he was, er...
He was destroying a peppermint stick.

483
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,394
That's six years ago.

484
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,755
Yeah, I guess it is.

485
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,718
Old man Pettigrew has been dead for four.

486
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,756
Sure.

487
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,232
Gosh, how can you
remember all that so well?

488
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,116
Well...

489
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,316
(Lambs bleating)

490
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,789
Uh-oh. I was afraid of that.

491
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:21,716
That's one calamity I missed out on.
This was still cow country when I pulled out.

492
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,912
Oh, look, Jase! Look at the baby!

493
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,436
Oh! Oh, look at him!

494
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,115
Is he precious? Oh, he the good boy?

495
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,031
- Ooh, he the good boy.
- Hm.

496
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,914
- He probably lost his mummy, huh?
- It's the other way around most likely.

497
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,911
The only one of the Lord's creatures

498
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,231
too stupid to recognise its own young one
is a mother sheep.

499
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,231
- Don't you say that.
- No, I mean it.

500
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,709
That could be the only black lamb
in the flock,

501
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,917
- but she wouldn't know it from a goat.
- I don't believe it.

502
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,673
Are you gonna eat or open up
an orphanage?

503
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,149
- You have no heart.
- Ah...

504
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,915
Oh, what a baby. Oh, yeah.

505
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,594
Oh, yes, he's a beauty. Yes, he's a beauty.

506
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,908
Hm.

507
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,949
- He probably thinks you're his mummy.
- He wouldn't know any better.

508
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,715
If my friends saw me doing this,
they'd run me out of town on a rail.

509
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,076
If I'd thought, we'd have stopped to eat
north of the dead line.

510
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,878
The what?

511
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,428
The dead line.
Passed it about ten minutes back.

512
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,036
- Sheep to the south, cattle to the north.
- I don't know anything about a dead line.

513
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,236
There's nothing complicated about it.

514
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,472
A cowman opened up this territory,
then the sheep men tried to move in.

515
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,554
We had us quite a debate. We burned up
a lot of powder and lead and buried a few.

516
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,315
Finally we drew us a line across
the southeast section of the state.

517
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,834
Sheep stay on one side
and cattle on the other.

518
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,833
- There. Look at that.
- Oh, thank you.

519
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,833
- May I have that napkin?
- Here.

520
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,071
Anyway, that little guy there

521
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,835
is gonna grow up to be one of those dumb,
miserable critters over there.

522
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,992
If they're so dumb,
why does anybody bother with them?

523
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:17,837
Money. You know it takes money,
capital, brains, sweat to raise cattle,

524
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,071
but any idiot with a dog
and a Winchester can raise sheep.

525
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,036
Whoa.

526
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,708
- Giddup!
- Mum! Mummy!

527
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,197
Mum!

528
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:03,798
Oh, Mum! I missed you something fierce.
I'm so glad you've come.

529
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,030
Ooh, let me see you!

530
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:10,671
Oh, you look good. You look so good!

531
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,228
You're gonna stay, ain't you, Ma?

532
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,357
- Oh, honey...
- You're welcome to stay if you like.

533
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,796
Oh, thank you very much.

534
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,436
- (Strains)
- Let Mama take that.

535
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,988
Look at me.

536
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,711
I must say, I was rather surprised
at your coming here.

537
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,512
Thank you.

538
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,036
Well, I want to find something to do,
Mr Minick.

539
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,673
You know I want to make a home
for Luther and me.

540
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,916
Mrs Minick, Luther has a home.

541
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,436
Until you're able to provide for him,
he will remain here.

542
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,712
Now, as to your own plans,
if you intend to live here, well and good.

543
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,315
Plenty of duties to perform
around the house.

544
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,188
In that case I shall give
my housekeeper notice.

545
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,956
If that doesn't appeal to you, there may be a
position clerking at the mercantile company.

546
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:17,272
The hours are seven in the morning until
seven at night, with a half-hour for lunch.

547
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:22,150
The salary is $50 a month, less an agreed
sum for your room and board here.

548
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,279
I put your suitcase away.
Want me to help you unpack?

549
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,828
That about covers the prospects,
Mrs Minick.

550
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,354
I suggest you think it over.

551
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,829
Now If you'll excuse me.

552
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:47,631
Well. Now tell me. How do you like
living with Grandpa, huh?

553
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,915
It's awful.

554
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,997
Is it?

555
00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:01,117
Well, honey, Grandpa invited Mama
to live here, too. Would you like that?

556
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,670
Oh, no, Ma. Please take me home. Please.

557
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,594
Oh, Luther! Luther!

558
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,353
Oh, God, baby!

559
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,479
- Hi, Debbie.
- What have you been up to, Jase?

560
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:39,235
- Buying a new saddle.
- You know what I mean.

561
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,835
I got a brand-new Parcheesi set.

562
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,715
You fond of Parcheesi, Jase?

563
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,911
There's Parcheesi and backgammon,

564
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,231
Round The World With Nellie Bligh,

565
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,833
cribbage...

566
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,070
Maybe you know some two-handed games.

567
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,957
Jase!

568
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,309
- Welcome home!
- Thank you, Jase.

569
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,676
- I didn't expect you back so soon.
- Well, something came up.

570
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,877
- Goodbye!
- Not bad news, I hope.

571
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,350
Well, it depends on how you look at it.
Thank you very much.

572
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,238
- Excuse me, Jase.
- Wait a minute! Give me that!

573
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,880
- I can manage it.
- No, that won't do at all.

574
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,678
I told you I can do it.

575
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,435
You look silly toting that in a town
full of able-bodied men.

576
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,715
- Where are we going?
- To the stable.

577
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,556
- Say, Ed?
- Yes'm.

578
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,551
- Is that a hack horse?
- Yes'm.

579
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,837
Good. You'll just do fine.
I'll want him for the rest of the day.

580
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,434
He ain't harnessed and I got no buggies.

581
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,159
Saddle him up, Ed.

582
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,391
But I ain't got no side-saddle.
I told you that before.

583
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,631
I'll be back shortly. You just get him ready.

584
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,991
Thank you.

585
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,470
Mr Simpson.

586
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,996
Hi, Josie.
How are things down in Cheyenne?

587
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,038
Fine, thank you.
I'd like a pair of Levis, please.

588
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:14,193
Let me see. What size is Luther now?

589
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,397
- Not for Luther. For me.
- How's that again?

590
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,074
- I'd like a pair of Levis for me.
- Pants?

591
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,718
Pants.

592
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,712
Josie.

593
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,916
Oh. Thank you.

594
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,033
See if you can find a pair of boots? Size 7?

595
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:42,398
- Don't have no ladies' boots.
- Well, feet are the same, aren't they?

596
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,917
Well... I never checked, Josie.
I'm a bachelor.

597
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,560
Well, why don't we try, Mr Simpson? Huh?

598
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,029
- A boys' size, maybe? Size 7.
- Yes, ma'am.

599
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,636
- Size 7.
- Thanks.

600
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,349
I almost forgot, Mr Simpson.
I want one of those blue shirts, too.

601
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,193
- 36 bust.
- Bust?

602
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,555
Oh. D-d-d-don't come in busts.

603
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,756
Necks and sleeves. No busts.

604
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,508
- What's she up to?
- I don't know.

605
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,597
What do you think, Mr Simpson?
Think they fit all right?

606
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,719
I don't think you're exactly
what the manufacturer had in mind.

607
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,428
- Er... don't forget that blue shirt.
- No busts.

608
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,875
Ain't got a bust in the house. No busts.

609
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,074
What size did you say that was, Josie?

610
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,720
- 36 bust.
- No busts.

611
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,636
Here. Try this.

612
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,272
Thanks.

613
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,836
The Presbyterians hear about this,
I'm through.

614
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,391
Josie, what are we trying to prove, anyway?
Huh?

615
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,312
Have you still got that crazy notion
about cow-ranching?

616
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,198
Mr Simpson, how much do I owe you?

617
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,718
- That'll be 11.65.
- And Mr Simpson...

618
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,712
if you don't mind,
I'd like to leave all my things here.

619
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,588
And my suitcase.
And I'll pick everything up later. All right?

620
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,148
Thank you very much. Bye.

621
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,473
- All set, Ed?
- Yes'm.

622
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,638
- I think I need your help, Ed.
- Yes, ma'am.

623
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,717
Heading south?

624
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,270
What in tarnation do you reckon
she's up to?

625
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,633
- Chickens.
- What do you mean, chickens?

626
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,388
A chicken is a domesticated bird
grown for its eggs, meat and feathers.

627
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,392
- It goes back in history...
- Doc, you know what he means.

628
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,994
How do you know Josie's
in the chicken business?

629
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:52,675
I'm bound by my oath to respect
the confidence of my patients.

630
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,240
Whoever heard of a chicken ranch here?

631
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:02,199
- Educated guess.
- Did she say it was chickens?

632
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,158
- Not exactly.
- What did she say?

633
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:11,068
Well, she kind of made a slip and I jumped
on it like a duck on a June bug.

634
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,390
I was taking her blood pressure at the time,

635
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:17,996
and her heart did flip-flops when she
realised she let the cat out of the bag.

636
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,514
She used the word flock.

637
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,910
- Flock?
- That's what she said. Flock.

638
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,515
What are you going to raise here
that comes in flocks except chickens?

639
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,795
Geese maybe? Or ducks?

640
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,519
- You're sure she said flock?
- Positive.

641
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,875
Geese come in gaggles.

642
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:43,473
What's she gonna do, trail-drive a flock
of fricassee hens south every fall?

643
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,551
That ain't funny.

644
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,599
Nor is a chicken ranch
in the middle of my range.

645
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,877
It's not your range, it's hers.
All 480 acres of it.

646
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,078
- Let her have her chickens.
- It's not chickens.

647
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,391
- It's not chickens? Then what...
- (Lamb bleats)

648
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,152
That ain't what you think, fellas.
It's a chicken.

649
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,597
You ought to know better than that,
young fella,

650
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,558
walking into a saloon without no invitation.

651
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,995
She's got no education yet.

652
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,310
It's too young for some.

653
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,830
Why, thank you, sir.

654
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,314
Long dry run up from the south.

655
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,395
Good Lord Almighty!

656
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,990
What in the name of the kingdom of God
do you think you're up to?

657
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:57,516
- Sheep. These here are sheep.
- You're damn right they're sheep.

658
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,239
Turn 'em around, get 'em out of here,
before...

659
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,959
No, we ain't headed that way,
we's headed up yonder.

660
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,951
You ain't going nowhere!

661
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:10,319
You know, I believe this little fella
would be better off on the ground.

662
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,233
Just set him down.
He'll find his mammy directly.

663
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,788
I'll wring his scrawny neck!

664
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,272
Dog! Get him! Get him!

665
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,836
- Cow fella down yonder don't like sheep.
- Mostly they don't.

666
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,310
Get this dog off me before I bust his head.

667
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,595
No offence, boy.

668
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,150
- He's a right little mean dog.
- What's his name?

669
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,789
Dog. We just call him Dog.

670
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,034
Butter wouldn't melt in her mouth.

671
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,075
Say something nice.

672
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:03,553
Mrs Minick, there has never been a woman
hung in the history of Arapahoe County.

673
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,713
If you get down from there and let me talk
to you, you might not be the first.

674
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,553
Josie, do you hear me?
You get down off that horse!

675
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,916
- (Whistles)
- Listen to me! Josie!

676
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,471
Three cheers for the first female
sheep rancher in southern Wyoming!

677
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:22,155
- Hip-hip!
- Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

678
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,196
(Cheering continues)

679
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,240
I smell like a damn sheep already.

680
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,517
If it hadn't been for you,
we'd have been sensible and hung her.

681
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:35,354
- Can't hang a person for manslaughter.
- We'd have found a way.

682
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,716
Now she's your doing and she's all yours,

683
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:43,191
her and her stinking sheep and
her crow-bait herders, that whole outfit.

684
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,238
Now you get rid of her or I will.

685
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,869
Baa, baa, black sheep, have you any
wool?

686
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,839
Yes, sir, yes, sir, a whole town full

687
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:05,996
Did you see what happened? Nobody likes it
and nobody's gonna have sheep.

688
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:10,596
I did and I don't much care.
I don't care what you say. They're staying.

689
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,557
No, they're not!

690
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:46,111
There ain't no question about it. We should
have hung her when we had the chance.

691
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,160
- Arch? More brandy?
- Yeah.

692
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:59,193
- Maybe she ain't coming.
- She'll be here, don't worry.

693
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,078
You're one hell of a judge,
that's all I got to say.

694
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,153
- Not my doing. It's the law.
- Ah! There's ways of looking at the law.

695
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,196
Only one way to look at this one.

696
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,874
That's the trouble.
We ain't got a leg to stand on.

697
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,793
There's no legal status for the dead line.

698
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,713
It's lawful to raise sheep
wherever you want to.

699
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,997
If she wants to take us to court,
she'll beat us hands down.

700
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,310
Not if you let me pick the jury.

701
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,312
We're not about to let you pick the jury.

702
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,868
Crawfishers. Every last one of you.

703
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:32,431
- It's a democracy.
- What this country needs is a good king.

704
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:35,034
It ain't gonna get to court anyway.

705
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:39,557
It's just as well. Jase will fight
all night long to turn her loose.

706
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,313
- If I had my way...
- You can't use a club on a woman.

707
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,755
That's all there is about it.

708
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,156
You've got to sweet-talk her out of it.

709
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,435
And that's just what we're going to do.

710
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,671
Arch?

711
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,911
- I ain't making no promises. Let her in.
- (Knocking)

712
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,549
Evening, neighbour. Well, come in.

713
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,713
Come in. Come right on in here
and see all your good friends.

714
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,597
Hello, Josie.

715
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:24,753
Your name happened to come up
in the conversation just a little bit ago.

716
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:27,718
- If it's about my sheep...
- You put your finger on it.

717
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,713
We propose to sit down and thrash this
thing out like grown-up men and women.

718
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,631
I have no intention of giving up...

719
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:37,349
Let's not bash our heads off the bat
without any preliminaries.

720
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,431
There are ways of talking things out,

721
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:44,275
of turning the sweet light of reason
on a question over a good drink of...

722
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:47,830
Would you like some sherry or something?

723
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,434
- What are you havin'?
- Brandy.

724
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:58,798
- Yeah, but I've got some real nice sherry...
- Brandy'll do just fine.

725
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,954
You taking on like a man,
you can drink like one.

726
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,917
- Arch.
- Fine with me.

727
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,917
Cheers.

728
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,635
(Coughs)

729
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:36,311
Josie, what we want to do is to help you.

730
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,518
Before we get off on the wrong track,
let's understand that. We want to help you.

731
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,068
- Help me what?
- Get rid of them sheep.

732
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:47,790
Wait a minute, Arch. Maybe I didn't make
myself too clear about the dead line.

733
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,757
There's no such thing.

734
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:54,356
We done populated an entire corner
of a cemetery with folks who believed that.

735
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,795
- Arch!
- Now paste that in your bonnet, woman.

736
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,348
I'll give you something
to paste in yours! Man!

737
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,830
Let's all simmer down.
There's nothing we can't solve with reason.

738
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,115
- If only the lady...
- Never mind the lady.

739
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,111
That's all you've said I agree with.

740
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,192
- Shut your mouth!
- You wanna step outside?

741
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:14,159
Shut up, both of you!
Who are we fightin' here?

742
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,277
Me. And I'm fightin' back.

743
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:21,911
I've got 480 acres and a flock of sheep,
and I mean to keep both of them.

744
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,755
Now give me another brandy.

745
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,710
We'll have to send you home
by Wells Fargo.

746
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:37,759
Never mind how I'm going to get home. I just
came here to tell you what I plan to do.

747
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,832
- What you're gonna do, woman, is listen.
- Arch, so help me!

748
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,990
Hear, hear, hear. Order in the court.

749
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,877
- Listen!
- I'm through listening.

750
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,714
You're getting us all in a messy fight.
Women are not made to fight.

751
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:52,349
- Fighting and ranching are for men to do.
- Damn it! Shut up, all of you.

752
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:56,149
Forget I'm a woman. I'm a human being.

753
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,869
I can take care of myself and my son
without anybody's charity.

754
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,557
I can think and I can work.

755
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:06,792
I'm not going to sit and wait for
some nice man to come and rescue me.

756
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:11,590
I don't want a man and I don't need a man.

757
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,672
I've got myself and I've got my sheep.

758
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,479
And I'm gonna bring them through to spring.

759
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:22,509
And I'm gonna sell my lambs and my wool
and I'm gonna double my money.

760
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:25,717
And nobody... Do you get that?

761
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,872
Nobody, not a damn one of you,

762
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,791
is gonna get in my way.

763
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,629
- Josie, why?
- Get out of my way, Jase.

764
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,235
Good morning.

765
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,352
Good morning.

766
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:14,516
Smell the nice hot coffee?

767
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,916
Thank you, Annabelle.

768
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,595
Come on, Josie. Let's up and at 'em.

769
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,475
- Here we go.
- No!

770
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,994
Oh! Oh!

771
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:38,197
Oh! Oh, what is that?

772
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,919
Ooh! Help me.

773
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,150
Ooh! Oh. Ooh.

774
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:46,471
Ooh. Ah. Ah.

775
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,790
That's all right. It's perfectly normal.

776
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,593
Well, Jase says you really
gave them what for last night.

777
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:03,674
You don't look well.
Put something in your drink, most likely.

778
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,116
Brandy.

779
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,714
Wouldn't put it past them.

780
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,915
Well, the sheep are bad enough,
Lord knows, but a woman with sheep!

781
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,916
Ohh.

782
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:23,598
Woman.

783
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:28,234
I'm not gonna budge an inch.

784
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,878
(Groans)

785
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:34,838
Well, guess they haven't told you, then.

786
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,832
Ooh! What?

787
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:43,276
Jase and his crew are down there now
rounding up your sheep.

788
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,150
- Mm-hm.
- What?

789
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,480
What?

790
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:55,518
Annabelle, fetch my pants.

791
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,110
Steady, Josie.

792
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:20,076
- How's that?
- Not the fastest gun alive.

793
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,628
Speed won't matter.
I'm countin' on surprise.

794
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,759
They'll be expecting this. You put a woman
in pants, the rest is bound to follow.

795
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,553
All right, Mr Simpson. Let's load her.

796
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,472
I did.

797
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:43,109
Oh! Mr Simpson!

798
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,871
Get them together!

799
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:02,715
Tony! Tony, get those damn things together.

800
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:10,030
I've never seen cow fellas
work so hard afore.

801
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,877
Look yonder there. Boss fella.

802
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,276
- I say he makes it.
- A whole dime?

803
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,590
Uh-huh.

804
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,557
You're on.

805
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,511
I thank you.

806
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,711
Mooney! Well, we're still gathering them up.

807
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,116
I can see that.

808
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,476
- You won't live this down.
- I already come to that conclusion.

809
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:10,074
Now just get them going, will you?

810
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,037
All right, boys. Send them over the ridge.

811
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:16,076
Send them over the ridge.

812
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:28,073
You reckon it's about time?

813
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,833
I'd say so.

814
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,036
Dog.

815
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,190
- Go.
- (Barking)

816
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:43,158
Get that dog out of there!
He'll scatter the sheep!

817
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:45,435
You know,
old Dog knows what he's a-doing.

818
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:49,195
Get him out of there! Mooney!
Get those sheep back there!

819
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:53,309
Yah! Yah! Hey!

820
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:59,474
- Call off that fool dog.
- Wouldn't make no sense.

821
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,551
We just called him on.

822
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:04,791
He's confused enough,
with all that sashaying out yonder.

823
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:15,435
Get off my land, all of you.

824
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:19,433
You turn that horse around
and head back to Annabelle's,

825
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,159
get back in bed where you belong
and let me handle this.

826
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:26,870
I said you get off my land and you take
your men with you. And I mean it.

827
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:31,954
I got enough trouble without you.
Scoot before I paddle those men's britches.

828
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:36,158
Hey, boss! What's the story?
Where are we going?

829
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,034
I'll get back to you in a minute.

830
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:52,196
Oh!

831
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,310
I mean it, Jase Meredith. Get off my land.

832
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,391
What do you think you're doing?

833
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:15,040
Don't you get off that horse.

834
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:19,352
Josie, you're gonna hurt someone!
Put that thing away!

835
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,829
You take your men and your horses

836
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:26,789
and your ideas about what a woman
can and can't do and you get off my land.

837
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,474
Josie, I am only trying to look...

838
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,515
Out!

839
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,194
I am only trying to look after your investment.

840
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:38,592
If I don't move these sheep out of here,
somebody else will move in with clubs.

841
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,591
Out.

842
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,229
Bratsch. Klugg.

843
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,073
Don't just sit there. Gather up my sheep.

844
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:12,316
You'd hardly think she could shoot.

845
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,630
That woman gets crazy every so often.

846
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,711
They're prisoners of their juices.

847
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:21,078
If I ever have anything to do with her again,
you got permission to bust me in the nose.

848
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:23,879
- Boss?
- Hm?

849
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,592
Wait here.

850
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,238
You got her outvoted by some.

851
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,629
I come prepared, is all.

852
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:06,792
- Give me some time.
- You've had all the time you're getting.

853
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,757
Just move out of the road.

854
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:12,913
Let me get her up here.
You talk to her direct. She'll understand.

855
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,073
I don't palaver with Injuns or women.
They get out of the road or get stomped on.

856
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:19,549
That's the end of this conversation.

857
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:22,996
There ain't gonna be a sheep alive
in that hollow by nightfall.

858
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:25,435
Now go on back
and tell your lady what I said.

859
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:36,308
- He's not bluffing. Get out of the line of fire.
- What about you?

860
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:39,358
I'm going down to try
to talk some sense into her.

861
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,273
I never figured I'd go to war
with no mutton militia.

862
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:46,239
- Nobody's asking you to, Mooney.
- I just volunteered.

863
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:50,472
I'm staying with Jase. I stink like a sheep,
might as well join them.

864
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,834
- Me too!
- You bet!

865
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,035
Count on me!

866
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:56,669
Let's get on down to the house
and make a line. Come on.

867
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,591
All right. Spread out. Find some cover.

868
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,672
What the hell's going on?

869
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:26,719
We decided there won't be any clubbing
today, or any day for that matter.

870
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:30,679
If you want to take your army back
to the Stockman's, I'll buy you all a beer.

871
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:36,431
- Do you know what you just said?
- If you want to shoot, we'll oblige.

872
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:41,874
All right, Jase, we'll wait. Right on that hill.

873
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:58,232
- I thought I told you...
- You see those men up on the hill?

874
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,958
See the clubs they're carrying?

875
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:04,352
Do you still want to go it alone,
taking man-size strides in them britches?

876
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,154
Now get down in the house.

877
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,631
Josie.

878
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,670
I'm sorry I said that.

879
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:33,156
You're thinking,
"What will happen if Wyoming is admitted

880
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:37,279
"as the only state in the Union
which allows its ladies to vote?"

881
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:42,798
You're thinking, no doubt, "What will the
ladies of the other 43 great sovereign states

882
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,916
"have to say about that?"

883
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,468
You can see in your mind's eye, perhaps,

884
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:52,793
the suffragette marches,
the militant female demonstrations.

885
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:56,793
Gentlemen, we're not going to allow
any of those things to happen.

886
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:02,238
Because our ladies
will give up their franchise voluntarily.

887
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:03,992
That's right, gentlemen.

888
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,709
If this distinguished body,
in its considered judgment,

889
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:11,679
decrees that they must,
as a condition for statehood,

890
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:16,595
the women of Wyoming territory
will give up their rights to vote.

891
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:23,199
Because, gentlemen,
the pioneer woman stands beside her man,

892
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:31,231
building together an edifice upon which
fair Columbia can look with pride.

893
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,629
Gentlemen, I tell you with all my heart...

894
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:39,431
Excuse me, Mr Lord. An urgent message
for you from... Where is it?

895
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,715
- Rapa... Rapa...
- Hoe.

896
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,870
- Huh?
- Hoe. Arapahoe.

897
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:12,796
(Mournful harmonica)

898
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:35,311
Three nights
they've been sitting up there now.

899
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:50,152
If you back that man into a corner, he's
gonna sure as hell do some crazy fool thing.

900
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,389
Yeah.

901
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:55,439
If it was anybody but Arch, anybody but... her.

902
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:02,389
I, er... don't usually hand out free advice,
but...

903
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:05,153
No, I'm way ahead of you, Mooney.

904
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,877
Cow fella up yonder's fitting himself
into a wet sweat.

905
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,032
Cow fellas tend to.

906
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,236
- He'll cool off in time.
- Huh.

907
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,398
What does that mean?

908
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:55,678
Only one way to cool a cow fella off.
Old John Tewksbury knew how.

909
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,318
For a fact, he did.

910
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:00,073
- John who?
- Tewksbury.

911
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:03,391
Down in Arizona. What's the score so far?

912
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:07,393
Well, it seems to me it's 18 Grahams
and four Tewksburys.

913
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:09,755
- Grahams is the cow fellas.
- Proud.

914
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,717
- Real proud.
- Tall in the saddle.

915
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:15,156
- Easy to hit.
- You mean 18...

916
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:18,391
- Cooled off.
- Dead?

917
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,118
Yep. 18 and four.

918
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:23,988
I can't recollect if that's countin'
the two that went down at the siege.

919
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,150
- Them two at the well.
- Fetchin' water.

920
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:28,754
Went down 'twixt the cow fellas
and sheep fellas.

921
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,638
Never knew if they
was kinfolk come to join in the fight

922
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:33,676
or just strangers passing through.

923
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,991
- That's awful!
- Yes, ma'am, it surely was.

924
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:40,709
Them being dead that way,
never could figure out who had to bury them.

925
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,794
18 and four and two strangers.
That's the way it'll likely be scored.

926
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:48,189
Old John Tewksbury and his kinfolk...

927
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:51,636
- It's not going to happen here!
- You don't think so?

928
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:54,996
Hardly any strangers
pass through here much anyhow.

929
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:59,153
There's not going to be any killin'.
I won't have it.

930
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,435
You don't want no killin', ma'am?

931
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:05,274
Well, what for you truck sheep critters
into cow country for?

932
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,559
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thanks.

933
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,394
Where are you going?

934
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:44,996
Follow the road south to Arch's fence line
and get on the road to town.

935
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:48,117
- I'm not leaving...
- You're going to stay at Annabelle's

936
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:51,158
till all the gun smoke's blown away.

937
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:53,435
There's not going to be any gun smoke,
Jase.

938
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,432
- Oh?
- Because I'm going to give up.

939
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:59,671
I'm going to wave the white flag
or whatever it is that you do.

940
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,159
Oh, are you?

941
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:06,075
And then are we going to make Arch Ogden
king and give him everything he wants?

942
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,878
Well, you can but I'm not.

943
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:11,077
I won't have men shooting holes
in each other because of me.

944
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:14,516
- I'm the one who started all this trouble.
- What trouble?

945
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,750
Please don't make jokes, Jase.

946
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:22,272
All right, Josie. I won't joke with you
and you won't kid me about quitting.

947
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:24,828
We got a tiger by the tail.
We're not letting go.

948
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:28,595
I won't leave you out here
with the feathers and the gun smoke.

949
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,796
Women are not put together to fight.

950
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,440
There must be something I can do, Jase.

951
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:36,669
What can I do?

952
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:39,035
There is something.

953
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,356
If you'd have sat down, all of you,

954
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:49,718
and put your chins in your hands
and wracked your ignorant brains

955
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,995
for six consecutive weeks,

956
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:55,834
you couldn't have come up
with a more perfect, tailor-made

957
01:20:55,920 --> 01:21:00,152
custom-built, foolproof way
to hold off statehood

958
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:04,916
for this miserable piece of wilderness
for the next 4,000 years.

959
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:10,390
At least it's not a complete disaster yet.

960
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:15,712
We've only got a little ground to get back to
be where we were when Columbus landed.

961
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:21,272
- We weren't trying to offend the ladies.
- Who said anything about offending them?

962
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:24,352
You didn't offend the ladies, Fonse.

963
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,317
You declared war on them.

964
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,631
That's what you did.
You declared war on them.

965
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:32,996
Look! Go on! Look!

966
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,036
(Shouting)

967
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,990
Three cheers for Josie Minick!

968
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:43,435
Here he is.

969
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,431
Get him!

970
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,873
Get right down off that horse, Mr Ogden.

971
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,918
How do you feel with your guns
and clubs and army of thugs

972
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,639
riding out on that helpless woman?

973
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:04,678
(Angry shouting)

974
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,269
Hail the conquering hero.

975
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,999
You got one minute, Charlie, and that's all.

976
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:19,437
You're gonna give me 20 years
if you lay a finger on that girl out there.

977
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,353
And if there's any bodily harm done,
or death,

978
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:25,716
you're gonna give me all you've got left
at the end of a rope.

979
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,109
You're taking this kind of personal.

980
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:31,909
- Personal? Hell! This is political.
- What?

981
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,833
The whole future of this territory

982
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:38,754
just happens to be hanging on
what happens to Josie out there.

983
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:44,198
If the ladies walk out on us, we don't have
a chance at statehood and you know it.

984
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:48,034
Sure I know it. And you know what I say?
The hell with it.

985
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:50,475
That's what you say? So be it.

986
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:53,313
Now I'll tell you what I say. Pay attention.

987
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:57,154
Either you plaster the seat of those fat pants
of yours in your saddle

988
01:22:57,240 --> 01:23:00,676
and hightail it out to that hollow
and call off your dogs,

989
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:05,880
or I'm gonna hit you with so many charges
it'll take 127 lawyers to read them.

990
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:10,310
- We'll see about that.
- We damn well will see about it.

991
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:13,153
You've got an hour, Arch.
You'd better make use of it.

992
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:18,756
Doc, will you?

993
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:29,711
United we stand and divided we fall.
Are we gonna let Josie down?

994
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,518
There's Josie!

995
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:45,112
Put me down! Put me down, please!

996
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:52,831
Congratulations.

997
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:04,233
Listen to me, everybody.
The men too. Listen.

998
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:08,836
I don't want to talk about women's rights.
I don't even want to talk about sheep.

999
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:11,673
Or the constitution or statehood.

1000
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,911
I just want to talk about Jase Meredith
and Mooney

1001
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,514
and all those other men out there.

1002
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:21,593
Do you know what they're doing?
They're looking into guns on those hills,

1003
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:24,911
ready to get killed
because of me and my sheep.

1004
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:31,750
I'm gonna tell you something, Arch Ogden.
You're through running things around here.

1005
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:36,391
You're not gonna run me or Jase Meredith
or anybody else, understand?

1006
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:40,758
And if you so much as lay a hand on him,
I swear to God I'll...

1007
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:43,308
- Let go of me!
- (Angry shouting)

1008
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:52,559
I wanna talk. To the men in this town.

1009
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:56,599
I'm gonna say things you ladies might not
like to hear so I invite you to leave.

1010
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:02,670
We've got a war on our hands! A war!

1011
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:09,313
This was cow country when we come here.
It is now. And it's always gonna be.

1012
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:12,517
- (Woman) That's a lie!
- Ain't nothing gonna change that,

1013
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:13,953
least of all no woman!

1014
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:18,477
Now is the time to stand
and join me in a holy crusade!

1015
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,676
- (Women shouting)
- I'm sorry.

1016
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:28,672
We're gonna march out there in a body

1017
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:31,274
and end this sheep business
once and for all.

1018
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,351
(Woman) Oh, no, you're not!

1019
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:36,716
Ain't no room in this town for sheep,

1020
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,633
or for no woman rancher.

1021
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:45,596
And there ain't a red-blooded
one hundred per cent patriotic man

1022
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:50,037
who's gonna stand by and see
either one of those things happen.

1023
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:52,839
Now stand up! Be counted!

1024
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:57,232
You're either with me or you're against me.

1025
01:25:57,320 --> 01:26:02,189
Now how many of you men are going to give
me a resounding vote of...

1026
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,991
The pioneer woman stands beside her man.

1027
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,750
- You're in charge.
- Arch...

1028
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,956
Shut up. I'm through talking. Hah! Hah!

1029
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:22,074
Jase!

1030
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:26,109
Water! The barn! Water!

1031
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:50,757
- Where's the water?
- The dang pump won't work!

1032
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:53,718
The dang pump won't work
and the barns are burning.

1033
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:56,234
Don't that beat all?

1034
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:03,193
- Let's give the boss a hand!
- Leave him be!

1035
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,510
It's his fight.

1036
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:11,678
Gets a little slick on them sheep critters.

1037
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:15,953
Arch?

1038
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,678
Arch? Arch?

1039
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,594
I'm still on the boss man.

1040
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:36,319
- Dime?
- Dime.

1041
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:37,913
You're on.

1042
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:50,832
Jase? Jase?

1043
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:36,116
Some of you men
carry this ram back up on his hill.

1044
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:48,874
We got ourselves a winner, Bratsch.

1045
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,712
Mm. I reckon.

1046
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:53,234
Let's get him into the house.

1047
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,871
(All shout)

1048
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:36,033
Here's Charlie. Charlie, get us out of here.

1049
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:45,515
- It's daybreak.
- Huh?

1050
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:48,431
The girls.

1051
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:23,919
What happened?

1052
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,560
Boss man cow fella had a break-in.

1053
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:31,594
Barn went that-a-way.

1054
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,912
- Where's Jase?
- Stove up considerable.

1055
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,070
Carried him in yonder.

1056
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:47,270
- Jase.
- Morning, Josie.

1057
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:49,715
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1058
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:52,917
- Oh, thank God.
- The barn's not so good, though.

1059
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,195
I don't care about the barn.

1060
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:58,795
Oh, Jase, I told you
we should have given up.

1061
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,873
I've got to get rid of those sheep out there.

1062
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:05,918
Charlie Lord told me so
in no uncertain terms.

1063
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,036
- Charlie Lord?
- Yes.

1064
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:11,954
Jase, I started a riot last night
and I spent the night in jail.

1065
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:14,270
- You what?
- Yes.

1066
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:17,670
Men and women all over the territory
are fighting because of me.

1067
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:20,558
- And you know where they're fighting?
- Where?

1068
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:22,710
- In their bedrooms.
- Bedrooms?

1069
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,233
Yes!

1070
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:27,630
Boss, you'd better get out here.
They're coming.

1071
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:34,149
Jase?

1072
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:55,070
You know something, Josie Minick?

1073
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:56,832
You're worse than that Greek gal

1074
01:32:56,920 --> 01:33:00,833
that caused all the fighting
'twixt her folks and the Trojans.

1075
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:04,833
- But that ain't what I come to say.
- What did you come to say?

1076
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:07,275
I'll do my business with the lady, Jase.

1077
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:11,159
- You gonna get rid of them sheep?
- I thought...

1078
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:14,038
- Wait a minute...
- You wanna take up where we left off?

1079
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:18,193
That's fine with me.
Get down off that horse and we'll go at it.

1080
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:25,396
You know something, Jase Meredith?
You're a worse calamity than these sheep.

1081
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:27,436
- For a nickel, I'd...
- Any time, Arch.

1082
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,636
Arch, get on with it!

1083
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:35,312
We're going to settle this sheep business,
Mrs Minick, right here and now.

1084
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:40,190
- I'm listening, Mr Ogden.
- Sheep and cows purely don't get along.

1085
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:44,831
- Anybody with brains someplace other...
- Arch, never mind that.

1086
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:50,310
Most folks understand that fact of nature.
Sheep and cows don't mix.

1087
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:54,188
You can have one or the other
but you can't have both.

1088
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:59,718
So either we all get rid of our cattle

1089
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,268
or you...

1090
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:06,433
consider sellin' off your sheep.

1091
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,636
I'll pay you for the flock

1092
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:13,793
and for the wool
and for the spring lamb crop too.

1093
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:16,030
I'll rebuild your barn.

1094
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:22,873
And I'll sell you first-rate breeding cows
and bulls at rock-bottom prices

1095
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:27,158
so you can get into the cattle business
alongside the rest of us.

1096
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:32,029
- You mean that?
- I said it once. I ain't gonna say it again.

1097
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:38,953
I ain't telling you, Mrs Minick. I'm asking you.

1098
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:42,749
Not as a woman. Man to man.

1099
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:45,957
Rancher to rancher. Strictly business.

1100
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:57,999
She'll take your proposition, Arch.

1101
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,476
All right. Let's go.

1102
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,876
Jase!

1103
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:28,515
Got a piece of advice for you, Columbine.

1104
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:31,637
You don't want to get too independent.

1105
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:35,030
Some is good, too much is miserable.

1106
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:40,196
You can only go so far,
because first thing you know...

1107
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:42,316
(Knocking on door)

1108
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:47,436
<i>...</i>there's a knock on the door
and you want to be listening.

1109
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,715
You sure do.

1110
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,797
Come in.

1111
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:02,795
You're beautiful. You're just beautiful.

1112
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:11,110
Well, Jenny McCardle said to buy a $40
corset, new French bonnet, a new dress,

1113
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:15,955
and join 46 churches, and she said
I'd have me a man by snow time.

1114
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:18,429
Who needs 46 churches, huh?

1115
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:21,676
Oh, put me down, I forgot something.

1116
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:30,271
Now I'm ready, Mr Meredith.

1117
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:35,233
- Where are we going?
- Steaks are on at my place.

1118
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:37,959
You may never get back alive.

1119
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:43,871
(Brass band)

1120
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:30,910
<i>I know since he has gone</i>

1121
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:39,396
<i>My dreams will fade like the morning dew</i>

1122
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:46,318
<i>But wait till tomorrow, tomorrow</i>

1123
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:52,555
<i>I'll make them all come true</i>
