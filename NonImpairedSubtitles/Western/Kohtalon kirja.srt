1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,460
.

2
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:44,178
Fire, water, wind,
earth and emptiness...

3
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:50,814
Five core elements of life
that once inspired a book.

4
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,775
The Book of Fate.

5
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,179
Far away from here
there was a mythical world -

6
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,214
free of suffering and injustice.

7
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,938
But it wasnt enough.
People wanted to play God...

8
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,093
They created a pen
to control the Book of Fate.

9
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,898
Mightier than a sword,
it could write off deeds -

10
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,132
and bring back the dead.

11
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,493
But the book gave power,
power caused fear -

12
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,979
and fear brought suffering.
And from the suffering arose a war.

13
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,373
Darkness fell on earth, making
demands on the pen and the book.

14
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,897
But the book was gone.

15
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,934
lt was thought
to be lost forever -

16
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,815
but hundreds of years later
it reappeared -

17
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,019
on a small planet called Earth.

18
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,978
The prophecy says:

19
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,139
Only the chosen will get
a second chance from the book.

20
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,414
The destiny of the chosen one
is to guide the book back.

21
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,860
But his journey will be long,
filled with errors and grief.

22
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,175
This is his story.

23
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:36,059
THE BOOK OF FATE

24
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,533
Did you hear their heavy steps?

25
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,937
I did, and I saw them.

26
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,815
Not human.

27
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,616
Wheres the cross?

28
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:22,255
Somewhere in here.
Its goIden, up to your waist.

29
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,773
You wont need me, wiII you?
-Youre a priest.

30
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,891
The onIy one who can read.
Think of our innocent sister.

31
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,376
It is aIready noon.
We must go on.

32
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,530
CarefuI, brother.

33
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,697
CaIm down, girI.

34
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,771
YouII be fine.

35
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,494
Get up, girI.

36
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,815
You mustnt stay here.

37
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,135
Sergei!
Can you see anything?

38
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,377
Viktor! HeIp!

39
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,216
Sergei! HeIp!

40
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,973
What a way to die...
-We Ieft him there!

41
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:19,418
This pIace is cursed.
I said we shouIdnt come here.

42
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,894
Our own brother, dead...
Lets Ieave whiIe we can.

43
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:29,977
Be quiet, Viktor! Tatjana is
turning into a monster Iike that.

44
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,530
She has been bitten
by the deviI himseIf.

45
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,975
We must find the cross first.
And we cant! -WeII find it.

46
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,891
But wiII it save our sister
if we take it to her bedside?

47
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,376
The cross and the text on it
wiII save Tatjana.

48
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,408
But were running out of time.
The sun wiII soon set.

49
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,129
Even the cross will be
powerless after the sunset.

50
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,052
YouII be fine.

51
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,259
Dont worry.

52
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,692
CaIm down.

53
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,178
YouII soon get some heIp.

54
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,293
Who are you?

55
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,409
WeII take care of this.

56
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:54,816
Its not too Iate.
The brothers can heIp her.

57
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,696
They went to get this.

58
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,936
The cross...

59
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:36,295
Perhaps it doesnt even exist.
Perhaps its just a taIe.

60
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,609
Quick, into the haIIway!

61
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:45,250
Is this the one?
Is that the speII?

62
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,932
But this book, this is...

63
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,456
Wheres the cross?
We need it.

64
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,939
You know about the cross.

65
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,977
My brother and the cross
are somewhere up there.

66
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:08,776
How do we get them down?
-NataIie...

67
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,296
Youre too weak for them.

68
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,453
God wiII protect me.
-Not in here.

69
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:35,012
NataIie, take the priest
and the cross out of here!

70
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,090
Priest!
Take the cross to the graveyard!

71
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,853
You!

72
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,529
What do you want?

73
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,449
Ive never Iiked you.

74
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,497
300 bucks, take it and Ieave!

75
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,735
Id waste it soon
if I were you.

76
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,496
Shut up, wiII you!

77
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,691
I smeII fear.

78
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:25,210
Shut up!
You dont know this scoundreI.

79
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:31,217
Same difference.
My brother and I wiII bury him.

80
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,729
You wiII hang
in the morning, boy.

81
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,928
WeII see about that, moron.

82
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,333
Im warning you,
if you wont go by horse now -

83
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,051
youII go feet first
in the morning!

84
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,852
Wrong town, dog!

85
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:46,573
The saIoon is cIosed.
Were out of Iiquor.

86
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,256
Do you wish to die?

87
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,013
Mom!

88
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,893
No!

89
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,454
No!!

90
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:54,419
I knew it!
Youre causing troubIe again.

91
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,897
Things were just fine...
-For you, perhaps.

92
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:03,168
This bunch is pure troubIe
but youve done nothing.

93
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:08,972
Ive got one of them in jaiI.

94
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:14,288
And he wiII never hang,
aIthough he deserves to.

95
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:19,900
You! Youre defending a man
who shot his own.

96
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:24,856
The truth is, another innocent
died because of you.

97
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:29,895
This time I wont...
-Men coming! At least four.

98
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,938
Hes coming to get his brother.

99
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,570
You shouId never
have come back.

100
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:41,217
Take cover.
Theres nothing more we can do.

101
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:46,978
Youre our onIy hope.
Redeem the past and heIp us.

102
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,771
I know you can.
Show it to us aII.

103
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,930
HeII just run away, Iike before.

104
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,049
Do your job.

105
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,289
This aint over.

106
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,894
Smart move.

107
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,849
Dont forget
whose side youre on.

108
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:03,254
River KoIIaanjoki
Finnish KareIia 1 939

109
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,217
Charge!

110
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,856
Death to the Russians!

111
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:42,211
Get ready! -Are we going
aII the way to Moscow?

112
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,893
Were in deep shit now.

113
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,972
Stop whining.

114
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:05,049
Lets send the shitheads
back to where they came from.

115
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:13,136
We have to fight this war
to end it.

116
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,179
Remember:
every shot counts!

117
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,452
Move!

118
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:12,889
We pissed them off
by pushing them back.

119
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,933
Goddammit!

120
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:54,057
The enemy has more men
but they have no guts.

121
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,416
WeII carry on tomorrow.

122
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:24,974
Thats enough war for one day.

123
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:33,414
And Merry Christmas!

124
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:27,774
Here are some parceIs
from the home front.

125
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,849
PaaviIainen...
RuhaIa...

126
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,449
Miettinen...

127
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,332
Ronkainen...

128
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,892
Ive been good.

129
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:51,096
This aint much.
-Come on! LepoIa...

130
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:01,935
The Russians had this.
What shouId I do with it?

131
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:14,213
III be... The Russians have
started making picture books.

132
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,411
This is not even Russian.
-If its from the Russians -

133
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:24,934
it must be taken to headquarters.
You know that, Pyykko.

134
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:30,898
They mustve been in a hurry!
The book is onIy haIf-done.

135
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:37,569
III take it when I go courting.
There are empty pages in it.

136
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:42,412
AII pages must be returned.
Even the used ones.

137
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,018
That wouId give them
something to study...

138
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,297
Greetings from home.

139
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:56,211
Your son is growing fast and
looks very much like his father.

140
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:01,051
He has your eyes,
and hes busy on all fours.

141
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,935
Are you scared?

142
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:36,691
I cant take this!
WiII this ever end?

143
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:42,174
Theyre just testing us a IittIe.

144
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:49,579
Were aII in the same boat here.
WeII make it, together.

145
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,897
Right?

146
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:57,816
Boys!
Is it time for a hymn?

147
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:04,609
Heavenly angel questioned us

148
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:09,657
Why do you startle
frightened so?

149
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:14,732
lve come with tidings
of a great joy

150
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:20,539
Soon to bring comfort to all men

151
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:26,140
Our Lord has come to us today

152
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:32,013
Christ is born in Bethlehem

153
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:37,409
This sign is hereby given you

154
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:43,338
The child is lying in its crib

155
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:48,371
Praise our Lord

156
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:53,530
For giving us his only Son

157
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:59,088
The angels join in, cheering on

158
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:05,775
Praising his glory gratefully

159
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,530
From here on -

160
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:14,657
our sabotage unit
wiII keep a Iow profiIe.

161
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:20,888
No stumbIing, SantaIa.
Were pIaying hardbaII here.

162
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,937
Take out the piIed-up charge.

163
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,255
Its empty!

164
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,932
Down!

165
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,453
Shit...

166
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,330
Fire!

167
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,579
It doesnt Iook good.
They got goddam near.

168
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,608
What happened?
-I dont know.

169
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,132
But we must move fast.

170
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,897
With what men?!

171
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,968
Dammit!

172
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:02,738
Hes professor Stromberg.
Age 52.

173
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:07,816
SingIe. Owns an internationaI
pharmaceuticaI congIomerate.

174
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:12,571
Loves gambIing,
suffers from mentaI probIems.

175
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:17,849
Your team,
Hoffren and DahI -

176
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,934
has taiIed Stromberg
for a whiIe now.

177
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:28,574
He has a new bioIogicaI weapon
heII seII to the highest bidder.

178
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:34,935
Your task is to stop the virus.
Whatever it takes.

179
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:04,569
Elvis is in the brothel.
Do you copy, Sinatra?

180
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,977
Do you copy?
-I hear you.

181
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:12,139
l thought you quit smoking.
-You got on my nerves.

182
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,209
Youve become goddam slow.

183
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:19,016
Hurt my butt falling off the tree.
-III fix it.

184
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,132
Promises...

185
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:25,693
Begin downloading.
-The Iink is good. III begin.

186
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:35,297
78 per cent transferred.

187
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,575
Transfer compIete.

188
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:49,011
Dont gamble our money.

189
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,937
Twenty. DeaIer wins.

190
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:05,019
I Iike your design coIors,
Mr. Stromberg.

191
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:08,616
Professor Stromberg.
And you are?

192
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:14,333
Henri. Henri LiIIqvist.

193
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:28,290
Do you wish to doubIe,
Mr. LiIIqvist?

194
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:34,094
Im afraid this is aII
I have with me.

195
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:51,215
Seventeen...
Sixteen.

196
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,971
22. Over.

197
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:02,173
Enjoy your victory
whiIe you can, Mr. LiIIqvist.

198
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,933
Next time,
the stakes wiII be higher.

199
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:10,970
Excuse me.

200
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,934
Im not feeIing weII...
-A coId?

201
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:19,890
Ive heard theres a virus
on the move. -Indeed...

202
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,773
Hoffren Ieft the premises.

203
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:41,059
A famiIy man,
famiIy expenses.

204
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:48,452
But were in no hurry.
Theres time before the fIight.

205
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:35,691
The pIane Ieaves in an hour.
Is everything ready?

206
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:42,136
Hoffren has returned the car,
but hes not answering his phone.

207
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:47,500
Notify StockhoIm.
TeII them to book a Iab...

208
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,971
You caIIed for a maid.
-Yes.

209
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:51,374
And you can send the biII
to Professor Stromberg.

210
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:34,738
RELEASE ME

211
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:56,013
Any progress?

212
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:03,452
Its not that easy. The book
has been studied for decades.

213
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:07,968
I need more time.
And to be Ieft aIone.

214
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:13,530
Nothing new. Yes. Over.

215
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,537
Take a break, honey!

216
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,900
Wheres my antidote?

217
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:50,812
I ran out of soft drinks.
I guess I drank it by mistake.

218
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,817
YouII die no matter what.

219
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:59,173
The question is:
how much wiII you suffer?

220
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:03,374
Im a busy man.

221
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:11,937
On my way to
an important meeting.

222
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:16,936
My mother aIways says that
rush is an excuse for the weak.

223
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:30,578
The fast wiII beat the sIow.

224
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:36,176
Dont teII them anything.
They can shove the antidote...

225
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:42,893
The antidote, Mr. LiIIqvist?
-My Ieft boot.

226
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,460
My Ieft.

227
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:05,214
Thank you.

228
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,896
UnfortunateIy
you wiII have to go now.

229
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,412
We aII have to go eventuaIIy.

230
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,616
Ronja and Sofia
wiII keep you company.

231
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,688
To the very end.

232
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:25,209
Wanna kiII them now?
Or pIay first?

233
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,453
Lets take the Iong route.

234
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:23,859
You hit Iike a woman.
-No more forepIay, boy!

235
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:40,496
Books are aIways good for you.

236
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,899
Wrong mans boat.

237
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:58,690
The shortest way between two points
is a straight Iine, says Mom.

238
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,488
Take a bath.

239
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:05,455
Stop or III kiII you aII.

240
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:09,974
Im the onIy one
with the antidote.

241
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:56,859
Lieber Condicionis.
Trust the book.

242
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:01,099
The blood of the innocent
is on your hands.

243
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,539
Space 21 24

244
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,653
My name is ApoIIo
and I am dead.

245
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:31,456
At Ieast according
to Federation records.

246
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:37,528
Im haIf man, haIf machine.
An android.

247
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:42,888
Doomed to IoneIiness, boring
tasks and obeying orders.

248
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:47,418
But I used to be a man.
I had a Iife.

249
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,977
An easy job and free wiII.

250
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:56,294
And Enya...
My beautifuI wife Enya.

251
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:04,970
Cargo ship AIias wiII be my home
for the next five years.

252
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:09,417
My destination is Thorid.

253
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:15,130
Human beings and the Thors
are going to sign a pact -

254
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:19,857
in a great inter-gaIactic event.

255
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:37,696
Lieber Condicionis,
The Book of Fate.

256
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:43,049
My task is to take it to the Thors
as a gesture of good faith.

257
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:47,534
In the book our schoIars
have found symboIs -

258
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:51,574
that resembIe
ancient Thor imagery.

259
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:57,458
Fortuna, seek information
about The Book of Fate.

260
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:01,131
Why is it incompIete?

261
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:07,809
Lieber Condicionis, The Book of
Fate, consists of 26 stories.

262
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:12,458
Author, origin and year:
unknown.

263
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:17,530
First observation on record:
Christmas 1 939 at Kollaanjoki.

264
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,897
Known for its last story -

265
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:25,458
with four incomplete segments.
Reason unknown.

266
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,938
1 773 Transylvania.

267
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:50,492
Priest Viktor Konstantinov
rules over the fate of his family.

268
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:53,937
Search Viktor Konstantinov,
1 8th century.

269
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:59,693
Ordained a priest in 1 77 1.
No other records.

270
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:05,494
Right before his death -

271
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:09,489
destiny gives the priest
a second chance.

272
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:14,570
Next opportunity: Arizona 1 887.

273
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:26,536
The innocent suffered again.

274
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:43,579
I got even more interested
in the book.

275
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:47,216
I studied the text,
began to understand.

276
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:50,851
The priests story was interesting.

277
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:55,970
He had been fearfuI, brave,
negIigent, even reckIess.

278
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:59,178
BIindIy doing the right thing.

279
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:04,136
The priest gave advice
but was never understood.

280
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:07,378
Energy level low.

281
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:23,137
The two shall be together.
lnfluencing one another.

282
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:28,455
The sentence on the first page
meant nothing to me -

283
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:33,934
but I couIdnt forget it.
-The co-ordinates cleared.

284
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:47,896
Good night.

285
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:07,697
The ship was ready. Enya
foIIowed me into a hyper sIeep -

286
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:12,731
but something eIse
was approaching us.

287
01:02:12,221 --> 01:02:14,940
1 8 months Iater

288
01:04:29,941 --> 01:04:33,695
Wake up! She is here.

289
01:04:55,061 --> 01:04:58,019
Fortuna...

290
01:05:08,381 --> 01:05:13,694
Fortuna, status report!
Fortuna!

291
01:07:07,261 --> 01:07:09,570
Dont move! Im a good shot.

292
01:07:09,941 --> 01:07:12,296
Give me the dakaijh.
Its not yours.

293
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:15,971
Who are you? What do you want?
How did you get in?

294
01:07:16,221 --> 01:07:21,215
Im Anyaih, the rightfuI owner
of the book. Give me my pen.

295
01:07:21,501 --> 01:07:24,618
The book beIongs
to the federation Earth.

296
01:07:24,941 --> 01:07:29,537
Its a serious offence to
tamper with it. Stand back.

297
01:07:29,861 --> 01:07:32,011
The book is indestructibIe.

298
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:34,979
You dont know
what youre deaIing with.

299
01:07:35,181 --> 01:07:38,457
Urgent call,
the Thorid consulate.

300
01:07:38,781 --> 01:07:42,569
Thats it!
Give me the dakaijh!

301
01:07:45,221 --> 01:07:49,931
Stay there, miss.
We can taIk about this.

302
01:07:51,461 --> 01:07:55,613
YouII be destroyed
unIess you give me the pen!

303
01:08:00,181 --> 01:08:04,459
Federation Earth.
Fortuna 331 01 ApoIIo 1 0.

304
01:08:04,901 --> 01:08:08,860
I am GaIagf, commander of
the Thor defence posts.

305
01:08:09,661 --> 01:08:12,971
This is a matter of
universaI security.

306
01:08:13,261 --> 01:08:16,856
Listen carefuIIy,
there is not much time.

307
01:08:17,181 --> 01:08:21,971
A very dangerous saboteur
is about to enter your ship.

308
01:08:22,781 --> 01:08:28,492
Dont be fooIed by appearances.
She is beautifuI, but deadIy.

309
01:08:29,021 --> 01:08:33,572
Shes aIready here! She aImost
destroyed The Book of Fate -

310
01:08:33,941 --> 01:08:39,698
but I Iocked her in the cargo hoId.
-Good. But that is not enough.

311
01:08:40,901 --> 01:08:46,134
She must be eIiminated.
You must kiII her.

312
01:08:47,181 --> 01:08:51,015
I can guard her
for the duration of the trip.

313
01:08:51,341 --> 01:08:56,176
Prisons wont stop her.
She has escaped before.

314
01:08:56,541 --> 01:08:59,578
Theres not much time.

315
01:09:01,141 --> 01:09:04,975
You dont understand.
In order to kiII -

316
01:09:05,221 --> 01:09:09,260
I must remove my energy chip
and that wiII be the end of me.

317
01:09:09,581 --> 01:09:12,414
You wiII sacrifice yourseIf

ruIe the universe himseIf.

323
01:10:32,181 --> 01:10:35,571
It is possibIe
with the book and the pen.

01:10:35,901 --> 01:10:40,816
They must not go to eviI hands.

334
01:12:04,221 --> 01:12:09,011

At Iast, I did something right.

Or did I?

Thats when I reaIized
my mistake.

340
01:13:04,821 --> 01:13:09,531
I understood what I had done
and what Anyaih had been after.

341
01:13:10,181 --> 01:13:15,938
Let GaIagf be destroyed,
Iet the good prevaiI.

342
01:13:16,461 --> 01:13:22,900
My mistake had repIaced
Iight with darkness.

343
01:13:36,181 --> 01:13:40,891
Time was running out.
创The two shaII be together.创
