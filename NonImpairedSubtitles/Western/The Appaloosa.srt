00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,166
But you are
such a filthy gringo,

337
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:33,638
I could spend all day here
cleanin' you up.

338
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,078
I want to thank you
for your nice present.

339
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,944
I would have paid for him.

340
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,749
I pay all my debts, seòor.

341
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,355
You want
your horse back, hmm?

342
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,821
Would you
like your horse?

343
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,500
Well, then,
come to Cocatlan.

344
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,965
Oh, you're not
very good at that.

345
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:03,036
You're not very good
at anything.

346
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,566
Adiós, amigo.

347
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:08,009
[laughing]

[hens clucking]

349
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:12,172
Well, I wanna tell you,
it sure feels good

350
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:14,575
to get that
goat hair off of me.

351
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:19,111
You got somethin'
I can wipe my face with, Ana?

352
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,080
Where in the hell
is Paco?

353
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,784
Probably gettin' drunk
all over again.

354
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:31,895
Okay, sweetheart,

355
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:34,829
how do you like me now?

356
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:36,298
[chuckling]

357
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:39,463
It's so white
from where the beard was.

358
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,266
Yeah. Let's see,

359
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,439
hmm,

360
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:52,614
if we can

361
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:55,151
work this thing out.

362
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,482
[sighing]

363
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,387
Yeah. That ought to do it.

364
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,528
Ana, bring...
Oh, here, good.

365
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:20,506
Mmm-hmm.

366
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:23,177
Leave that stain on a while.

367
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,607
Coffee grounds
do not make a Mexican.

368
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,625
[chuckling]

369
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:41,461
[kissing]

370
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,063
Go and get the old man's jacket,
will you?

371
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:46,964
I wanna try it on.

372
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:59,213
(Ana)
Mateo, do not go.

373
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,821
(Matt) Ana, excuse me,
sweetheart.

374
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,537
[sniffs]

375
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:28,543
(Ana)
Do not go.

376
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,514
I'll be back in a few days.

377
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,843
No, you will not be back
in a few days,

378
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:39,355
or a few weeks,
or a few months.

379
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,490
We will be lightin' candles
for the dead.

380
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,859
If we're gonna have a ranch,
we gotta have a horse around here.

381
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,831
A ranch. W-what do we need
with a ranch?

382
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,430
It's only more work.

383
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:54,302
Yeah, that's not
what you were sayin' yesterday.

384
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,839
We want you, Mateo.

385
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:58,375
You're more important to us
than any ranch.

386
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:03,209
Oh, Ana, I'll be back here with that 
horse before you can turn around.

387
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,910
It'll be as easy
as cuttin' butter.

388
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,810
It is your throat
that will be cut, Mateo.

389
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,086
You do not know
about Chuy Medina.

390
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,623
Well, the man stole my horse.

391
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:15,955
What the hell am I supposed to do?
Go over there and, uh,

392
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,393
and sit down in the river
and forget about it?

393
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:19,760
[clanking]

394
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,230
Horse.

395
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:25,026
Horse. I am tired
of hearin' about that horse.

396
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,560
You drifter.

397
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:30,497
You come in here
worryin' about a horse.

398
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:33,133
What do you think
will happen to my family?

399
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:36,511
All right, go to Méjico.
Go get it.

400
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:39,309
He will cut you up
in little pieces,

401
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:42,148
and we will bury you
and plant more corn.

402
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,916
You just
don't understand.

403
00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:00,594
It's not about a man
stealin' my horse, Ana.

404
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,264
[sighing]

405
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,605
It's about somethin'
that happened

406
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,711
a long time ago,
before you was even born.

407
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:14,816
It started when Paco's dad
picked me up when I was a scared,

408
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,144
dirty, skinny, little runt,

409
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,790
and brought me home here,
to live.

410
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:24,955
Scrubbed me up and treated me
like I was his own blood.

411
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,322
And he never
gave up on me, Ana.

412
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,928
Not--not even when I stole.

413
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:36,137
Not even when I lied
or when I cheated him.

414
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,667
I've seen him sweat
like an ox

415
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,976
in the corn field all so as he can 
get some grub on the table for us.

416
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:49,248
No matter
how hard he worked,

417
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,486
no matter how worn out
he was after workin',

418
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,821
he used to come here
and sit in this chair

419
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,922
and play the guitar
and sing us a song,

420
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,355
teach us a little bit
how to read,

421
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,457
best he knew how, anyway.

422
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:07,297
About that time,
I left here with that old

423
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:10,600
one-eyed mule and $1.86
in my pocket.

424
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,971
And that was all the grubstake
he had to give me.

425
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,173
And I had big ideas

426
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,308
about what I was goin' to do,

427
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:26,351
how I was going to
get myself a hat full of gold,

428
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:30,288
come back here
with a real pretty lady,

429
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:35,425
and build us a big old hacienda out 
there by the pig house

430
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,235
so as the old man
wouldn't have to work no more.

431
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:42,735
I thought, maybe with a good stallion,
we can build us

432
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,799
a little horse ranch
and give it to the kids.

433
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:50,839
That old man spent a whole lot of years
tryin' to make...

[sighing]

435
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,044
a decent man out of me,

436
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,821
and gettin' that horse was about 
the only way I can see

437
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,654
to payin' him back.

438
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,858
I never realized

439
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,725
that his arms
were so short.

440
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,697
[horse neighing]

441
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,939
Well, here comes Paco.

442
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,195
(Ana) Paco, Paco,
reason with him.

443
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:51,870
Tell him not to go.

444
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:54,235
There is nothin' I can do.

445
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,798
Okay, kid,

446
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,740
where are we goin'
and how do we get there?

447
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,137
Once you go
across the river into Méjico,

448
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:32,043
you take the main carretera
to Cocatlan.

449
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,875
Always keep goin'
in the southwest.

450
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:36,977
It's one, two days' ride.

451
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:39,519
Remember,

452
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,659
Chuy is not just one man,
Chuy is an army.

453

Please,

454
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,794
don't trust anyone.

455
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,376
Mateo,

456
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:13,783
you may get cold.

457
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:19,059
Hope not.

(Matt)
Sí.

467
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,630
Permit me, seòor,
to buy you a pulque.

468
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:23,132
(Matt)
With pleasure, amigo.

469
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:28,607
Is this your first visit
to this pulquería?

470
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:29,873
Yes.

471
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,046
It's a nice
little place, though.

472
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:37,382
They got a few flies in the pulque,

Do you know, seòor,

475
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,995
where the custom
comes from,

476
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,397
to drink the first litro
without stopping?

477
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,301
No, I don't know
how that started.

478
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,202
I was just wondering.

479
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,506
I do not know, either.

00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,563
Do you have business
somewhere in Sonora?

I want to ask you a question.

Does, uh, Catamaria still have

00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,472

stinking old underwear.

662
00:59:11,814 --> 00:59:14,305
You have humor.
It is very good.

663
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:17,083
Our lives would be
very sad without it.

664
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:21,882
Another drink, seòor.

665
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:25,387
You don't want to
see me drunk again, do you?

666
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:27,718
No.

667
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,765
I just think that

668
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:36,265
maybe now

669
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,399
you are afraid
to be in Cocatlan.

670
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:42,333
Hmm?

671
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:45,879
A little bit?

672
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:51,944
Yeah. A little bit.

673
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,680
Bueno.

674
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:58,650
But then, I never was too much 
afraid of a horse thief.

675
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:02,859
Do not be impolite, seòor.

676
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:08,365
I was thinking,

677
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,872
that day when I hanged
you up on the gate

678
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:14,241
and I made you an invitation
to come to Cocatlan,

679
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:18,841
I did not think you would
accept my invitation.

680
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,106
Seòor.

681
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,615
Why did you do
such a stupid thing?

682
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:28,546
Well...

683
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:31,092
Suppose a fellow
came into your backyard

684
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:33,161
and made a damn
fool out of you.

685
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:36,995
Stole your horse.
What would you do?

686
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:40,068
I would kill him.

687
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:46,341
But I do not expect that you will 
try that here in Cocatlan.

688
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:48,566
Hmm?

689
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:52,103
Well, I'll tell you something,
Mr. Medina.

690
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:54,441
I don't know you

691
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:56,845
and I don't like you.

692
01:00:57,787 --> 01:00:59,948
But I didn't come
here to kill you.

693
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:03,921
If that'd been
any other horse,

694
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:06,859
I wouldn't have
made a fuss about it.

695
01:01:07,363 --> 01:01:10,332
But that lndian pony
is a whole lot of things to me.

696
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,031
And, uh, if I don't
leave here with it,

697
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:18,467
I'm not gonna
leave here without it.

698
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:22,636
All right.

699
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:26,241
I'll give you a chance.

Yeah.

do you think?

Yeah.

704

Then you think you can
force my arm down, no?

705
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:46,757
Yeah.

706

These are from Durango.

Perhaps you do not know that
the scorpion of Durango is very deadly.

In Méjico, everything must be

If I lose, seòor,
I fill my belly with tequila

729

We have no priests
in Cocatlan.

But we have a church.

731

I will see to it personally

that you die in the church.

it is we who take things

826
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:24,211
I was the only girl.

827
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:27,718
Chuy promised my father

828
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:31,281
that I would be his woman
and have a good life.

829
01:15:32,928 --> 01:15:36,523
When I left, my mother gave me
her wedding dress.

830
01:15:37,799 --> 01:15:41,291
I thought I would be
married in a church

831
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:45,039
with a priest
and all the pretty robes,

01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:57,879
But there was
no priest in Cocatlan.

835
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:01,752
And I learned what
the good life was.

01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:05,851
When Chuy's finished with me,

837
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:10,794
he will give me to his pistoleros
like the other girls.

838
01:16:15,537 --> 01:16:17,402
I will not go back to that.

839
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:20,968
I would rather be dead.

840
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:25,602
All right.

841
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:32,282
