00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:43,015
OH, HE'S A SMART MAN, MARY.
AMBITIOUS, HARD WORKER.
BE A BIG MAN SOMEDAY.

141
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:45,518
I LIKE A LITTLE ONE
I CAN BOSS AROUND.
OH, NO, NO, NO.

142
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,521
I'M SERIOUS. HE'D MAKE
A GOOD HUSBAND FOR YOU,
THAT LAD.

143
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,523
HIS GRANDFATHER WAS SCOTCH.

144
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:54,527
I WOULDN'T THINK OF GETTING
MARRIED UNTIL YOU AND FLETCH
ARE OLD ENOUGH TO STOP FIGHTING.

145
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,029
THE CARRIAGE IS READY, SIR.
THANK YOU, TOM.

146
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,532
I'M GONNA BE IN DODGE CITY
FOR ABOUT A WEEK.

147
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:03,035
IF I COULD KNOW YOU'LL TAKE
CANTRELL, I COULD BUY YOU
A HANDSOME WEDDING PRESENT.

148
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,538
WHAT ARE YOU,
A BANKER OR A MATCHMAKER?

149
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,209
THERE YOU ARE, SIR.

150
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,213
HA! SMOOTH
AS A BABY'S... LEG.

151
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,717
YOUR HONOR, THEM'S
THE KINDEST WORDS I'VE HEARD
FROM A JUDGE IN YEARS.

152
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:20,219
MOSTLY THEY SAY,
"THIRTY DAYS. "

153
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:24,724
MY FRIEND, YOU MAY PAINT
A SHAVING MUG WITH THE NAME
"JUDGE BUCKNER"...

154
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:28,227
AND COUNT UPON ME
AS A STEADY PATRON
NOW THAT YOU'RE ESTABLISHED.

155
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:32,231
TWO BITS.
OH, TUT, TUT, TUT.
I SHALL SETTLE WITH YOU WEEKLY.

156
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,233
OR, PERHAPS, MONTHLY.

157
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,736
YOU'LL SUM UP MY ACCOUNT--
I BEG YOUR PARDON, MADAM.

158
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:40,239
HE'S AN EXCELLENT SHAVE, MADAM.
OH, I'M SORRY, MADAM.
GOOD MORNING, MA'AM.

159
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,743
I WISH TO HAVE
A TOOTH PULLED.
YES, MA'AM.
WILL YOU BE SEATED, PLEASE?

160
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,247
THERE YA ARE.
WHAT'S THIS?

161
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:52,251
IMBIBE, MADAM, OR SUFFER.
I DO NOT IMBIBE.

162
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:56,756
VERY WELL, MA'AM.
NOW, IF YOU'LL KINDLY PLACE YOUR
RIGHT KNEE AGAINST MY CHEST.

163
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:00,259
WHY, I'VE NEVER HEARD
OF SUCH A THING IN MY LIFE.
I'LL TELL MY HUSBAND.

164
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,262
JUST FOR LEVERAGE, MA'AM.
JUST FOR LEVERAGE.
[ Screams ]

165
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:06,766
SAY "AH. "
THERE WE ARE.
AH!

166
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,768
I TAKE A SHORT TRIP
OUT OF TOWN,
AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENS.

167
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,771
FOUR KILLINGS IN A WEEK.
IT'S GOT TO STOP.

168
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,773
FOUR?
DID YOU SAY FOUR?

169
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:17,276
THAT'S RIGHT, FOUR!
WELL, WE'RE GETTING TO BE
QUITE A TOWN, AREN'T WE?

170
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:20,279
I DOUBT IF THEY HAVE
THAT MANY IN DODGE CITY.
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

171
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,282
WE AIM TO COMPETE
WITH ANY CITY IN SIZE,
BUT NOT IN LAWLESSNESS.

172
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,285
CERTAINLY, OF COURSE,
FOUR KILLINGS IS OUTRAGEOUS.

173
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,288
THE JUDGE WAS SAYING,
MR. McCLOUD, BEFORE YOU CAME,

174
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,791
THAT THE APPOINTMENT
OF A MARSHAL IS OBVIOUSLY
IN ORDER.

175
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:37,296
IF I CAN FIND THE RIGHT MAN.
I HAVE A NEPHEW. HE'S A FINE,
UPSTANDING YOUNG MAN WHO--

176
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,298
WHO YOU'D LIKE TO SEE
ON THE CITY PAYROLL.

177
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,801
WELL, THE MAN WE NEED
MUST BE HONEST,

178
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,304
MUST HAVE COURAGE,
KNOW HOW TO HANDLE MEN.

179
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,807
HAVE YOU ANY SUGGESTIONS?
WAIT NOW,
THERE'S MY NEPHEW.

180
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,309
HE'S OUT!
WE REALLY FELT, MR. McCLOUD,

181
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,813
THAT YOU'D PROBABLY MAKE
A NOMINATION.

182
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:56,766
GENTLEMEN, I THINK I KNOW
THE VERY MAN.

183
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,819
LOOK OUT FOR THE RUTS, WILL.
"LOOK OUT FOR THE RUTS. "

184
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,821
THERE YOU HAVE
THE STORY OF MY LIFE.

185
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,824
ONLY I NEVER DID LOOK OUT.
ALWAYS BEEN IN ONE.

186
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,326
LOOK AT ME NOW--
A SCHOOLTEACHER.

187
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:10,329
WHERE'S THAT GOING
TO GET ME?
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO?

188
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:14,333
I THINK I COULD GO
CLEAR TO THE TOP IF I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE THERE WAITING.

189
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,837
WHY NOT GO TO THE TOP
ANYWAY, JUST FOR THE CLIMB
AND THE VIEW?

190
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,840
- [ Chattering ]
- ALL RIGHT.

191
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,842
I'M FROM TENNESSEE.
WHAT OF IT?

192
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,845
WE AIN'T WANTIN' PEOPLE
AROUND HERE
WHO SELL THEIR VOTES.

193
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:29,849
I DON'T HAVE TO SELL MINE.
I GOT A BUSINESS OF MY OWN.
SMART ALECK, HUH?

194
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:32,852
WHAT DO YOU SAY, BOYS,
WE GIVE HIM A LIFT OUT OF TOWN?

195
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,354
TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF OF HIM.

196
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,859
WHO MIGHT YOU BE?

197
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,862
NOTHIN' TO YOU. I JUST SAID,
KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF.

198
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:46,365
YOU TALK MIGHTY BIG FOR ONE MAN.
WHAT RIGHT DO YOU GOT
TO BUTT INTO THIS?

199
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,367
I'LL TELL YA,
YA PACK OF COYOTES.

200
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:51,871
A MAN BORN IN THIS COUNTRY
IS AN AMERICAN.
DON'T FORGET THAT.

201
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:54,323
IT'S HIS RIGHT TO...

202
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:58,878
GO WHERE HE PLEASES,
AND IT'S MY BUSINESS TO--

203
00:12:59,128 --> 00:13:01,330
COME ON, MARY.

204
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,887
HIT HIM IN THE TEETH, BOB,
IN THE TEETH.

205
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:12,892
LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND, MISTER.
THANKS. WHERE'D YOU
COME FROM?

206
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:16,896
- BEEN FOLLOWIN' YOU
AROUND ALL MORNIN'.
- WHAT FOR?

207
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:20,900
YOU'RE A COWBOY,
AIN'T YA?
YEP. FROM TEXAS. WHY?

208
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,241
AH!

209
00:13:29,658 --> 00:13:33,746
SURE, THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.
THEM DOGGIES ARE THE BOLDEST
I EVER RODE HERD ON.

210
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:37,249
IT'S LIKE SOMETIMES
OUT ON THE RANGE AFTER YOU GOT
THE HERD BEDDED DOWN--

211
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,753
[ Man Groaning ]
THAT'S MY TONGUE.
MY MISTAKE.

212
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,255
EVER HAD
YOUR TOOTH PULLED?
NO, ALL GOOD.

213
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:47,259
YOU'RE LUCKY.
SAY, YOU REALLY BUSTED
THAT KNUCKLE, DIDN'T YA?

214
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:51,764
OH, IT AIN'T NOTHIN'.
NO, I'VE HAD LOTS OF 'EM.
HERE'S WHAT I ALWAYS USE.

215
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:55,267
THANKS,
BUT YOU AIN'T TOLD ME
IF I'D GO OUT ON THE RANGE,

216
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,269
WHAT'S THE FIRST THING
THEY'RE GONNA ASK ME?

217
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,271
FOR CHEWIN' TOBACCO,
MOST LIKELY.

218
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,774
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANTED TO ASK YOU.
ME?

219
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:05,277
YEAH. YOU KNOW THAT GIRL
I WAS STARING AT
WHEN ALL THE RUCKUS STARTED--

220
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,279
YEAH.
WELL, WHO IS SHE?

221
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:10,783
WELL, HER NAME IS
MARY McCLOUD. WHY?

222
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:15,788
WELL, I'LL TELL YA.
I THINK MAYBE I'LL MARRY HER.
WHAT?

223
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,290
OF COURSE, IF SHE'LL HAVE ME.
I MEAN,

224
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,793
A FELLA WOULDN'T WANT TO MARRY
ANYONE THAT DIDN'T WANT HIM,
NATURALLY.

225
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,296
OH, NATURALLY.
YOU KNOW HER WELL?

226
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,799
NO, JUST SEEN HER
ONCE OR TWICE.

227
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,803
ONCE SHE WAS ON A HORSE.
THE NEXT TIME
SHE WAS WITH A JACKASS.

228
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,806
HE IS, HUH?
MAKES IT EASIER, DON'T IT?

229
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:37,810
PRACTICALLY A CINCH.
YOU DO THINGS KINDA
SUDDEN, DON'T YA?

230
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,812
NO, NOT EXACTLY.

231
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,314
BUT, YOU SEE, I GOT HER
FIGURED OUT THIS WAY.

232
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:45,317
IF YOU LIKE SOMEONE
AND YOU DON'T TELL 'EM
RIGHT OFF,

233
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:49,321
WHY, MAYBE ALL THAT TIME
YOU WASTED, SHE LIKED YOU, TOO,

234
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,323
SO, WELL, ALL THAT
TIME'S WASTED, AIN'T IT?

235
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:55,828
IT IS, THE WAY YOU PUT IT.
HOW DO YOU EXPECT
TO GO ABOUT THIS?

236
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,332
OH, YES.
GLAD YOU MENTIONED THAT.

237
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,837
UH, I FIGURED THAT
IF YOU WAS TO TAKE ME
OVER TO HER...

238
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:10,843
AND GIVE ME AN INTRODUCE, THEN
I COULD TELL HER WHO I WAS AND
THAT I NEVER MURDERED NOBODY,

239
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:14,346
AND YOU COULD GO SOMEWHERE
AND SIT ON A FENCE
TILL I WAS THROUGH.

240
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,851
I'M SURE YOU WON'T BE LONG.
WELL, COME ON, I THINK
SHE'S OVER AT THE BANK.

HE'S A REAL COWBOY.
FROM TEXAS.

THIS IS HER FATHER'S BANK.

WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

247

I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

AND I'LL GO BRING HER.
FAIR ENOUGH.

252
00:15:55,721 --> 00:16:00,392
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS
MY APPRECIATION, MR. McCLOUD.

I SUPPOSE IT WILL BE LEFT
TO A VOTE, HUH?

00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,973
BACK THERE IN THE OFFICE,
I HAD THIS ALL FIGURED OUT.

279
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:24,977
OUT THERE ON THE PRAIRIE,
IT SEEMED EASY.
YOU GOT BLUE EYES.

280
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:28,480
I BEG YOUR PARDON.
YES, SIR, BLUE EYES.

281
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,482
OH, LET'S SEE NOW.
WHERE WAS I?

282
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:33,986
BOB SETON,
FROM TEXAS.

283
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:37,489
MA DIED WHEN I WAS
NINE YEARS OLD,
AND ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS AGO--

284
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,992
I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU SAY,
MR. McCLOUD.

285
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:43,495
AND, ONCE AGAIN,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD LUCK TO YA.

286
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:48,500
WHERE'S MARY?
SHE WENT ACROSS THE STREET
TO BUY A SPOOL OF THREAD.

287
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,503
OH, WELL, I'LL GO--
I WOULDN'T DO THAT,
IF I WAS YOU, MR. CANTRELL.

288
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:55,507
SHE ALWAYS GETS A LITTLE FIDGETY
WHEN SHE'S BUYING
A SPOOL OF THREAD OR SOMETHING.

289
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:59,011
DAD, YOU TELL HIM ABOUT ME
GOIN' TO BE A COWBOY.
GO AHEAD AND TELL HIM.

290
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:03,015
THAT'S THE ONLY TIME
I WAS EVER IN JAIL, AND IT WAS
THE OTHER FELLA'S FAULT.

291
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:07,019
I WAS DRUNK.
DRINKING, OF COURSE,
CONSTITUTING NO CRIME.

292
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:11,523
MA'AM?
I SAID, DRINKING, OF COURSE,
CONSTITUTING NO CRIME.

293
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,526
I'M GONNA LEARN BIG WORDS
MYSELF SOMEDAY.

294
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:19,031
NOW LOOK, I'VE LISTENED TO YOU
VERY PATIENTLY. I'VE HEARD
YOU WHOLE LIFE'S HISTORY.

295
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:22,034
I KNOW WHAT TO DO FOR CATTLE
WHO'VE EATEN TOO MANY
LOCO WEEDS,

296
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,536
WHY SULPHUR IN MOLASSES
ISN'T AS GOOD AS PEOPLE
THINK IT IS...

297
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,538
AND A THOUSAND OTHER THINGS
THAT I'VE FORGOTTEN ALREADY.

298
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:30,042
NOW WILL YOU PLEASE GET
TO THE POINT AND TELL ME
WHAT YOU WANT?

299
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,045
I WANT TO MARRY YOU.
YOU WHAT?

300
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,548
WELL, I AIN'T GOT NO JOB
RIGHT NOW, BUT I FIGURE
TO GET ONE.

301
00:18:36,632 --> 00:18:39,551
OUTSIDE OF A SNORT OF HOOCH
NOW AND THEN,
I GOT NO BAD HABITS.

302
00:18:40,002 --> 00:18:44,556
I'D SAY ASKING PERFECT STRANGERS
TO MARRY YOU IS-IS
A VERY BAD HABIT!

303
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,560
YOU LOOKIN' FOR SOMEONE, MA'AM?
YES! SURELY THEY DON'T
LET YOU OUT ALONE, DO THEY?

304
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,565
WE GOT A SAYIN' DOWN IN TEXAS
THAT A FELLA DOESN'T GET
ANYPLACE UNLESS HE TRIES.

305
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:56,568
WELL, YOU MIGHT AS WELL
GIVE UP TRYING, BECAUSE
IT'S NOT GONNA HELP YOU.

306
00:18:56,568 --> 00:19:00,572
WE GOT ANOTHER SAYING IN TEXAS--
YES, YES, I'M SURE YOU HAVE.
GOOD-BYE.

307
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,578
THAT'LL BE FOUR AND A HALF.
TWO FOR THE TOOTH,
TWO AND A HALF FOR THE WHISKEY.

308
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:11,083
YOU GOT ANOTHER SWIG COMIN'.
I AIN'T GOT CASH. MAYBE
YOU COULD TAKE IT IN TRADE.

309
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,586
OH, I WAS AFRAID OF THAT.
I PULLED TEETH IN BOSTON ONCE
FOR A YEAR.

310
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,588
PRACTICALLY LIVED ON BEANS.

311
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:20,092
GOT SOME STUFF OUTSIDE
THAT BEATS MONEY IN THE BANK
IN THIS TERRITORY.

312
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:23,095
WAGONLOAD OF GUNS.
AND THEY'D HAVE BEEN
TOOKEN AWAY FROM ME,

313
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,097
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THAT
YOUNG FRIEND OF YOURS.

314
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,099
AIN'T LEGAL TO RUN GUNS.
YOU KNOW THAT.

315
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:31,103
WHAT'S LEGAL AND WHAT AIN'T?
WHY, THESE TOWNS AIN'T GO
NO MARSHALS.

316
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,105
YOU NEEDIN' A PARTNER,
MISTER?

317
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:37,609
MM, MAYBE.
NO, YOU DON'T.
OH, NO, YOU DON'T.

318
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,112
HE GOT HIT IN THAT FIGHT.
HE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S SAYIN'.
LISTEN, SON--

319
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,114
HOW ABOUT IT?
YOU CAN'T, BOB.

320
00:19:42,397 --> 00:19:45,117
I'M SICK OF THIS HERE
CITY LIFE.

321
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,619
FELLA CAN'T GO AROUND
DOIN' NOTHIN' ALL THE TIME.

322
00:19:48,036 --> 00:19:52,124
YEAH, I COULD MAKE
A GOOD GUNRUNNER OUTTA YOU.
OVER MY DEAD BODY.

323
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,628
DOC'S RIGHT, SON.
GUNRUNNING'S NOT
FOR YOUR KIND.

324
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,631
YOU AIN'T A WRECKER, BOY.
YOU'RE A BUILDER.

325
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,633
DOC'S RIGHT AGAIN.

326
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,636
YOU'RE THE KIND
THIS COUNTRY NEEDS.
[ Chuckles ]

327
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:08,140
SUPPOSE IT SOUNDS FUNNY,
FOR AN OLD LAW-BREAKING COOT
LIKE ME TO TALK PATRIOTISM.

328
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,643
WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN THAT
WHISKEY, STARS AND STRIPES?
I'LL GIVE YOU COUPLE GUNS.

329
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,647
SHUCKS, YOU DON'T OWE ME
NOTHIN'. GIVE YOUR TOOTH BACK
FOR A SOUVENIR, IF YOU LIKE.

330
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:19,651
NO, GIVE IT TO THE KID.
SOMEDAY WHEN HE SEES ME
STRUNG UP AT THE END OF A ROPE,

331
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,154
HE'LL REMEMBER I GAVE HIM
SOME GOOD ADVICE.

332
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,656
GOOD-BYE, GENTLEMEN.
GOOD-BYE.

COME ON, SON, WHAT'S WRONG?

MIXED UP IN THIS.

SAME ONE WE MET
COMING INTO TOWN?

338
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,182
HER? SHE MAKES ME SICK.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

339
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:53,135
WHY, DOWN IN TEXAS,
THEY'D LAUGH HER
OUT OF TOWN.

340
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,687
SHE DON'T KNOW
HER OWN MIND,
THAT FEMALE.

341
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:59,191
FELLA CAN'T EXPECT
TO WIN A WOMAN UNLESS HE DOES
SOMETHING WORTHWHILE.

342

00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:08,700
YEAH.
WHAT DOES IT SAY?

345
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,203
SAYS THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR A NEW MARSHAL.

346

IT DOES, HUH?

347
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:18,210
YOU KNOW, BOB, YOU COULD
MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF YOURSELF
IF YOU TRIED.
YEAH?

348
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,713
YEAH.
YOU COULD RUN FOR MARSHAL.

UNCLE SAM THAN AGIN' HIM.

LISTEN, YOU DON'T
READ AND WRITE A MAN
INTO JAIL.

354
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:41,733
MARSHAL'S GOTTA KNOW SOMETHING.
HE'S GOTTA HAVE PAPERS
ON HIS DESK AND THINGS.

355

I'LL BE GLAD TO HELP YOU
IF I CAN.

552

GLAD TO HEAR THAT,
TEACHER.

I HOPE YOU ABIDE BY IT
LIKE A CHRISTIAN DOES
THE GOOD BOOK.

PENALTY FOR SMUGGLIN'.

559

FIVE YEARS, EH?

565
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:43,501
IT'S A BIG SLICE
OUT OF A MAN'S LIFE,
TEACHER.

566
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:46,003
WHAT'S YOUR POINT,
SETON?

567
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:51,509
POINT IS, SOMEONE TRIED
TO RUN IN 500 RIFLES TONIGHT.

568
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:55,012
MM-HMM.
I FIGURED ON A GUN RUN
ONCE MYSELF.

569
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:58,516
EVEN I WAS TOO SMART
FOR THAT.

570
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:01,519
MR. CANTRELL, YOU'RE
ONE OF THE SMARTEST MEN
I'VE EVER KNOWN.

571
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:05,022
NOW, IF I DIDN'T LIKE YA--
NOW, JUST A MINUTE.

NO, JUST TELLIN' YA.

574

I'D RATHER GIVE YOU ADVICE
HERE IN THE SCHOOLHOUSE...

575
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,533
THAN TO LOCK YA
IN THE JAILHOUSE.

576

WHY, YOU'RE A CRAZY MAN!

577
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:22,039
GUNRUNNING
AND SCHOOLTEACHING DON'T MIX.
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT?

578
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:27,044
I KNOW IT.
MAKE SURE YOU DO.

579
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:42,560
SO I'M LEARNIN' FLETCH
HOW TO BE A GOOD COWHAND.

HE'S LEARNIN' ME
TO BE A GENTLEMAN.

YOU'RE BEING CHEATED.

HOW SO?
GOOD MORNING, WILL.

583

GOOD MORNING.

584

I'M NOT SETTIN' SO GOOD
WITH YOUR FRIEND, MR. CANTRELL.

585
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:02,580
WHY?
I THINK HE'S GOT
THE IDEA...

586
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,083
THAT I'M TRYIN'
TO STEAL YOU AWAY
OR SOMETHING.

WELL, I THINK MAYBE
HE'S RIGHT. GIDDYAP.

WITH THE DEMOCRATS
DIVIDING UP BETWEEN
DOUGLAS AND BRECKENRIDGE.

YEP. RUCKUSES IN THE SOUTH.
RUCKUSES IN THE NORTH.

00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,603
LOOKS LIKE WAR
JUST AROUND THE CORNER.

593
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:29,106
WELL, ALL I WANT'S
TO BE LET ALONE
TO RAISE KANSAS WHEAT.

594
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:31,609
SOUTH TROUBLE AIN'T
NO CONCERN OF OURS.

WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
YOU FEEL SOUTH OR NORTH,

IT'S A MATTER OF POCKETBOOK
TO THE SOUTH.

598

YES, SIR, WHAT THEY WANT'S
FREE LABOR.

599
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,121
IN A NORTHERN MILL,
A MAN'S GOT A CHANCE
TO EARN A LIVING WAGE.

600
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:46,624
EIGHT AND SOMETIMES
TEN DOLLARS A WEEK.

601
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:49,627
CHEAP SLAVE LABOR--
THAT'S WHAT THE SOUTH
WANTS TO FIGHT FOR.

602
00:38:49,877 --> 00:38:52,129
ALL THIS TALK
ABOUT SOUTHERN TRADITION
AND CHIVALRY.

603
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,131
WELL, THERE IS TRADITION
THERE, MR. HALE.

604
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,634
WHICH MR. HALE
CAN HARDLY APPRECIATE.

OH, ONE OF JEFF DAVIS' BOYS,
HUH?

606

WELL, I'D LIKE TO SEE THIS
SOUTHERN TRADITION AND CHIVALRY
BEFORE I CHANGE MY MIND.

607
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,143
THAT'S A WISH THAT'D BE
HARD TO GRATIFY.

608
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:08,145
SOUTHERN HOMES KEEP
YOUR KIND IN THE STABLES.

609
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:11,649
YEAH? WELL, MAYBE
IF YOU HAD A MEAL IN THE STABLE
ONCE IN A WHILE...

610
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:14,652
AFTER A HARD DAY'S WORK,
YOU'D COME DOWN
OFF YOUR HIGH HORSE,

611

OF YOURS LIVIN' HIGH OFF
OF OTHER PEOPLE, TALKIN' BIG.

IN YOUR LIFE, NEITHER OF YOU.
YOU'RE A LIAR, MR. HALE.

AND CHIVALRY OUT OF YOU.

FINE YOUNG SNOB OF A SON!

OR VIRGINIA WHERE THE LAWS
ARE SO RIGID.

623
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:29,727
THIS IS THE FRONTIER.
I HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE MY SON
RELEASED ON BAIL.

624
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:33,230
SET THE AMOUNT
AS HIGH AS YOU LIKE.
I'LL POST IT IN CASH RIGHT NOW.

625
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,733
I'M SORRY, MR. McCLOUD,
BUT I JUST CAN'T DO IT.

626
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,736
YOU BOUGHT A HORSE TODAY
FROM MARTIN CLAUSSEN--

627
00:40:39,153 --> 00:40:41,238
THE FASTEST HORSE HE OWNS.

628
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:45,242
WELL, THAT HORSE COULD TAKE
A MAN ACROSS THE BORDER
AND INTO SAFETY.

629

WOULD THAT BE SO AWFUL?
HE'S ONLY A BOY.

630

HE'S OLD ENOUGH
TO CARRY A GUN AND USE IT.

631
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:53,751
HE'LL HAVE TO STAY
IN MY CUSTODY.

632
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:56,754
YOU'LL SIT THERE AND CALMLY
SENTENCE MY BOY TO DEATH.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

633
00:40:56,837 --> 00:41:00,758
BUT HE'LL BE SAFE, MR. McCLOUD.
HE'LL GET A FAIR TRIAL.
RELEASE MY BOY ON BAIL!

634
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:05,262
PLEASE, DAD.
LET ME SPEAK TO HIM.

635
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:15,272
BOB, I'M NOT GOING TO ARGUE
WITH YOU ABOUT RIGHT OR WRONG,
OR DUTY OR LAW.

636
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:18,776

FOR THE LIFE OF MY BROTHER.

[ Stammering ]
I CAN'T.
IT-IT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT.

638

I DON'T CARE
WHETHER IT'S RIGHT OR NOT!

639
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:30,788
DOESN'T IT MEAN SOMETHING
TO YOU THAT I'M ASKING YOU
TO DO THIS FOR ME?

640
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:36,293
THAT BOY ADORES YOU, BOB.
HE IDOLIZES YOU.

641
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:39,797
HE WANTS TO PATTERN
HIS LIFE AFTER YOURS.
DOESN'T THAT MEAN SOMETHING?

642
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:42,800
MARY, I'D LIKE TO.

00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:49,306

DO IT FOR ME, FOR HIM,

WHEN I TOOK THIS JOB--

I TOOK AN OATH--

THE OTHER NIGHT
THAT YOU LOVE ME.
