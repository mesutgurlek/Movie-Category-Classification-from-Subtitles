1
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,914
Come on, kids, out of the street.
Come on, kids, get back there.

2
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,628
Hey, you. Get out of there!

3
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,190
Get out of the street!

4
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,999
Get out of the street!
Clear the street!

5
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,230
Get away from there!

6
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,029
Get out of the way, old man.
can't you hear?

7
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,760
can't you see you're in the way?
Get out of here!

8
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,480
- All right.
- Out of the way!

9
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,795
Watch out, old-timer.

10
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,156
You got a good horse, but not
good enough. I'll have that dollar.

11
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,709
I'm beginning to figure
these races smell bad.

12
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,916
That thing never loses.

13
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,277
- You had your chance.
- Well, let's just say I'm a poor loser.

14
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,873
So if you want this dollar...

15
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,350
...you just come right on over here
and get it, sonny boy.

16
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,909
Right this way, folks.
Come one, come all.

17
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,356
Step right up and try your luck.
Everybody welcome.

18
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,511
See the Oregon Kid in person.

19
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,717
Right this way, folks.
Come one, come all.

20
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,440
Step right up and outshoot
the famous Oregon Kid.

21
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,750
The last of the Western town-tamers.

22
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,357
Fatten your wallets and be a hero
to your family. Everybody welcome.

23
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,877
Step up. Try your luck. All you gotta do
is hit the plates, and you win the money.

24
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,192
- Quit the sermon and turn her loose.
- One dollar on the yellow.

25
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,956
Shooting against you is like
sneaking licorice from a baby girI.

26
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,750
Care to try again?

27
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,272
Mister, could I make a 10-cent bet?

28
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,637
A whole dime? You're a plunger, sir.

29
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,430
Well, I ain't so altogether sure I could
hit a moving target without buckshot.

30
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,716
I used to be fair with a scattergun...

31
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,714
...but then that was when the bird
wasn't too far away or flying too fast.

32
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,111
Them plates, I just don't see
how you manage.

33
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,516
Well, I'll be damned.

34
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,750
- How are you, GiI?
- No great complaints.

35
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,229
How long has it been?
Lordy, I'd hate to say.

36
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,753
Quite some time.

37
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,672
Where you been all these years?

38
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,719
Here and there.
Quite a little enterprise you've got.

39
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,151
Well, Steve, it's easier
than punching cows...

40
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,517
...and it pays off with free drinks
when I walk into a saloon.

41
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,558
Would it surprise you
that the Oregon Kid is the envy...

42
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,032
...of every small-minded ribbon clerk and
shirttaiI towhead from here to Pocatello?

43
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,158
Well, why not?
All these single-handed exploits.

44
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,394
Tell me, GiI, who was the Omaha gang?
I don't seem to recollect them fellers.

45
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,553
Flagstaff, Monterey, Hondo,
I remember we worked them places.

46
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,759
Dodge City and Wichita.
Did you ever run with the Earp boys, GiI?

47
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,356
You gotta allow for exaggeration.
That's part of playing the game.

48
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,069
That's not much of a game. A blind man
couldn't miss using buckshot.

49
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,959
It must be something important
to bring you here.

50
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,317
Looks like you've been riding
a long time but not getting far.

51
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,833
Job.

52
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,560
You mean you're still at it?
FederaI marshaI?

53
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,188
No, working for the bank.

54
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,271
You, a bank guard?

55
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,911
I'm transporting gold from the mining
camp up there to the bank down here.

56
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,039
Gold bullion, $250,000 worth,
the way the letter put it.

57
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,794
A quarter of a million.

58
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,350
And I could use some help.
Can you recommend anyone?

59
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,839
- I'll give it some thought.
- You do that, will you?

60
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,152
- And let me know.
- I will, Steve. I surely will.

61
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,952
What do you figure we're gonna do?

62
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,550
Drink champagne, kid,
and only the best.

63
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,554
About $250,000 worth.

64
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,273
- I'd like to see Mr. Samson, please.
- He's busy.

65
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,029
Would you tell him it's Mr. Judd.
Stephen Judd.

66
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,716
Just one minute.

67
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,917
Excuse me, sir.

68
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,556
Mr. Judd.

69
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,796
Have him come in, Abner.

70
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,711
Mr. Samson will see you.

71
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,313
Thank you.

72
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,154
How do you do, Mr. Judd?

73
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,709
I'm Luther Samson,
and this is my son, Abner.

74
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,714
- He's the vice president.
- I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Judd.

75
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,391
Well, I must say, Mr. Judd,
I expected a much younger man.

76
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,270
- Well, I used to be. We all used to be.
- Yes. Yes, of course.

77
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,352
Mr. Judd, we're more than familiar
with your reputation.

78
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,832
But that was made many years ago, and
we're dealing in the present, not the past.

79
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,279
What's the problem?

80
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,874
The Coarsegold strike
is on the crest of the Sierras.

81
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,315
There's only one traiI. One in, one out.

82
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,836
Six miners have been killed
trying to get their gold to us.

83
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,798
Six miners killed and robbed, Mr. Judd.

84
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,396
SeveraI weeks ago we petitioned
for a marshaI, but nothing happened.

85
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,757
The only law there is too drunk
to hit the ground with his hat.

86
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,913
The man we send must be completely
reliable, to say nothing of being honest.

87
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,789
We're speaking of gold, Mr. Judd.
Twenty thousand dollars worth.

88
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,552
Twenty thousand?

89
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,030
Why, I thought your letter said 250,000.

90
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,431
Our originaI estimate
was overly enthusiastic.

91
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,036
The strike isn't a mother lode,
but it's productive. Slow and steady.

92
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,034
- And we intend to get our share.
- The days of the forty-niners are past...

93
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,636
...and the days of the steady
businessmen have arrived.

94
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,633
My usuaI fee is $20 a day.
I'll have to charge you 40.

95
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,552
- Forty dollars a day?
- For what?

96
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,474
For two extra men. I don't intend
to go four days without sleeping.

97
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,710
- The question is-
- Can I do it?

98
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,440
I can't answer that by talking,
only by doing it.

99
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,513
If you two wanna talk about it,
you go ahead, and I'll read the contract.

100
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,150
Well, I guess that'll be all right.

101
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,755
- In private, if you please.
- Well...

102
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,751
...you can go in there.

103
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,236
Well, the contract's all right.
How about me? Any doubts?

104
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,636
If not, I'll sign it.

105
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,469
Well, I guess it's all right.

106
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,550
That old man is Steve Judd?
He don't look like much to me.

107
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,198
Son, I wore a star for six years
with that old man.

108
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,035
I was his deputy most of the time.
Once he was mine.

109
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,395
Don't ever play him short.

110
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,438
I just don't figure him
to be any trouble, that's all.

111
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,593
I hope you're right, boy.
I surely hope you're right.

112
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,276
I'll be at the lion. You demonstrate how
impressed you are, with your mouth shut.

113
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,192
- Hi, Mr. Westrum.
- Evening, honey.

114
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,873
Hello, Heck.

115
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,430
- Stop that!
- What did I do?

116
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,319
Never mind what you did.
Don't do it in here.

117
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,040
- Can I pick you up in an hour?
- I think so.

118
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,760
Too bad, because Heck won't be there.

119
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,595
- Why not?
- Because if I can't, you won't.

120
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,959
- Still keeping records, eh?
- You know me. Creature of habit.

121
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,396
Somebody else wants to know you.
My partner, Heck Longtree.

122
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,869
You'd blush to hear the way
he admires you.

123
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,031
- How do you do?
- Howdy.

124
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,872
Have a chair.

125
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,596
Showing your age, aren't you?

126
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,513
Interfering in a young man's love life.

127
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,752
He's got more important things
on his mind. Haven't you?

128
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,514
Haven't you? Yes, sir, and so have I.

129
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,832
Been considering your problem. Think
I can solve half, perhaps the whole thing.

130
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,798
I know a fellow who's got
an overwhelming hankering...

131
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,155
...for a little old-time activity.

132
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,836
A man would have to be pretty hard up
to want to risk his life for $ 10 a day.

133
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,797
Ten dollars a day?

134
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,678
Not hard up. Just fed up.

135
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,595
Outshooting rubes for nickels and dimes.
Takes free drinks to put me to sleep.

136
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,115
My partner feels the same way.

137
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,595
- Don't you?
- Yeah.

138
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,436
- I don't think I'd wanna hire a boy.
- What do you mean, a boy?

139
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,558
Steve, this boy's a good deaI
less than green.

140
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,871
- He can't have much behind him.
- That's where you're wrong.

141
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,430
He's been dogging after me
for better than three years.

142
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,473
Pretty.

143
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,756
Too bad he can't keep it clean.

144
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,036
Boys nowadays. No pride.
No self-respect.

145
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,316
Plenty of gall, but no sand.

146
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,836
- Now, you take that race today-
- What about that race?

147
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,595
Well, at that distance, no horse
in the world could beat a cameI.

148
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,830
Are you calling me a cheat?

149
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,275
Well, if he don't, I will.

150
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,517
Go get them, tiger.
You're doing fine. Just fine.

151
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,831
- What do you think, Steve?
- I think he's wonderfuI.

152
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,276
He'll do. He'll do just fine.

153
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,237
What's the matter, partner?
Your rheumatism bothering you?

154
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,198
I'm used to working with my brain,
not my backside.

155
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,397
- You think you can talk him into it?
- One way or another.

156
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,597
I'd just as soon we'd split it
two ways instead of three.

157
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,479
Kid, you've got an awfuI lot to learn.

158
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,828
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

159
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,353
Joshua Knudsen's the name.

160
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,717
This is GiI Westrum and Heck Longtree.

161
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,997
My name is Judd. Stephen Judd.

162
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,078
- I've heard the name.
- We're on our way to coarsegold.

163
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,674
Could you furnish accommodations
for the night?

164
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,436
I've got no room in the house, but I won't
object if you wanna stay in the barn.

165
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,872
Thank you, sir. If you could spare us a
few eggs, we'd be glad to pay for them.

166
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,715
Well, one you can have. Because
the Lord's bounty is not for sale.

167
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,314
- The rest are a dollar each.
- A dollar each?

168
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,153
How do those short-legged chickens
lay eggs so high?

169
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,472
Levity in the young is like unto a dry
gourd with the seeds rattling around.

170
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,429
My daughter, Elsa.

171
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,951
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you.

172
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,156
- Likewise.
- Go start supper.

173
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,232
- And change that dress.
- Change it? What for?

174
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,836
For the good reason I told you to.
Did you hear what I said?

175
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,118
- I think it's a reaI pretty dress.
- Thank you.

176
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,710
Put your horses in the corraI yonder.

177
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,190
Supper will be ready in an hour.
No charge. The Lord's bounty-

178
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,033
- Is not for sale.
- Thank you, sir.

179
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,714
Think of all that going to waste up here.

180
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,633
Like the fellow said,
gold is where you find it.

181
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,076
And if it's not yours, don't covet it.

182
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,678
<i>Don't worry.
The Lord's bounty may not be for sale...</i>

183
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,355
<i>...but the deviI's is,
if you can pay the price.</i>

184
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,032
There's a lot of truth
in those words, Heck.

185
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,713
Yeah?

186
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,193
- Yeah.
- Supper's ready.

187
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,719
Gentlemen.

188
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,516
Heavenly Father, we thank thee
for the food on this table.

189
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,829
Teach thy children to be gratefuI
for thy goodness...

190
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,355
...to walk in thy path...

191
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,555
...that they may not suffer
thy wrath and thy vengeance.

192
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,109
Bless us, O Lord,
and these our guests...

193
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,034
...and forgive them the mercenary
desires which brought them here.

194
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,038
Amen.

195
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,751
Thanks for entering a plea on our behalf,
but what's this about mercenary desires?

196
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,072
You're on your way to coarsegold. Them
that traveI there do so for one reason.

197
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,071
To traffic in gold.

198
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,598
Which to possess is to live in fear,
to desire, to live in sorrow.

199
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,832
But we're not trafficking, sir.
Merely transporting.

200
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,154
It says in the Book, Gold is a stumbling
block to them that sacrifice to it...

201
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,550
...and every fooI
shall be taken therewith.

202
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,439
A good name is rather to be chosen
than great riches.

203
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,558
A loving favor
rather than silver and gold.

204
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,392
Proverbs, chapter 22.

205
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,951
Into the land of trouble and anguish
come the old lions...

206
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,874
...and they shall carry their riches
on the shoulders of young asses...

207
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,554
...to a people that shall not profit them.

208
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,235
Isaiah, chapter 30, verse six.

209
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,073
That mining town
is a sinkhole of depravity.

210
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,797
A place of shame and sin.

211
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,316
According to Father, every place
outside this farm is a place of sin.

212
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,199
- That'll do.
- You don't have to preach at everybody.

213
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,793
That will do.

214
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,550
You cook a lovely ham hock,
Miss Knudsen. Just lovely.

215
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,550
Appetite, chapter one.

216
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,469
Give me a toweI, and I'll dry.

217
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,079
Thanks just the same. You hadn't better.

218
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,473
It must be pretty lonely living up here.

219
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,955
Sometimes I think there's nobody
left in the world but my father and me.

220
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,669
It's a crime. A girI like you
being stuck up on this old stump ranch.

221
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,196
A girI like you ought to
be living in the city.

222
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,396
San Francisco, say.

223
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,950
- You've been there?
- Plenty of times.

224
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,229
I never been anywhere.

225
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,115
He won't even take me to town
when he goes after supplies.

226
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,272
He says the men would stare at me.

227
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,917
Suppose on the way back,
I was to pick you up...

228
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,271
...and take you to San Francisco...

229
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,759
...or Denver.

230
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,957
- Chicago, even.
- Elsa, who you talking to in there?

231
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,315
To myself. You'd better go.

232
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,152
- I'll meet you outside.
- I can't.

233
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,311
I'll wait for you by the corraI.

234
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,239
That boy you trained personally
shows a substantiaI lack of judgment.

235
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,958
Showing your age, aren't you?

236
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,119
Interfering with a young man's love life?

237
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,435
Well, I'm not paying him $ 10 a day
to go mooning after some girI...

238
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,195
<i>...whose old man's about
to hind-end him with a load of buckshot.</i>

239
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,355
- Know who she reminds me of, Steve?
- No.

240
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,670
Sara Truesdale.

241
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,192
There's no resemblance at all.

242
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,557
Oh, maybe not in the features,
but the way she smiles.

243
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,598
There's the same look in her eyes
when you talk to her.

244
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,673
The kind of look that makes you feeI
you've said something reaI important.

245
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,873
You and Sara always looked
so right together.

246
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,554
I can't say I blamed her
for not marrying you.

247
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,319
Forgetting the lousy money we made,
what woman wants to sit around...

248
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,234
...waiting for her husband to be
brought home with his head shot off?

249
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,755
I wonder if I can get these fixed
in Coarsegold.

250
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:51,391
I guess losing Sara is what you
might call a hazard of our profession.

251
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,196
That rancher she married...
Stacey, is it?

252
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,432
He's doing fine up in Idaho.
Got a big ranch there.

253
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,909
Raises blooded horses.

254
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,994
- And children too, I hear.
- Grandchildren now.

255
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,552
Three of them.

256
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,477
That right, Steve?

257
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,113
Yep, that's right.

258
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,355
Three grandchildren.
Think she's happy, Steve?

259
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,114
If my sleeping bothers you,
don't you bother to let me know.

260
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,158
Sorry.

261
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,238
Evening.

262
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,112
- You surely took your time.
- I shouldn't be here at all.

263
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,874
Well, why? Does the night air
bother you?

264
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,349
If it does, come on up in the hay.

265
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,670
I love the night air.

266
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,032
The thing is, I'm what
you might call engaged.

267
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,839
- Sure you are.
- It's the truth.

268
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,116
His name is Billy Hammond.

269
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,713
He asked me to marry him.

270
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,952
SeveraI times.

271
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,153
I said I thought I probably would.

272
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,399
You'll see him in coarsegold. He's
a miner at the strike, doing reaI well.

273
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,158
<i>Well, if he's in coarsegold...</i>

274
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,832
<i>...and you're here...</i>

275
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,389
<i>...I don't see any harm in talking.</i>

276
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,352
You! Get in the barn and stay there!

277
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,834
And you, go to the house.

278
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,877
The mouth of a strange woman
is a deep pit...

279
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,794
...and him that is abhorred
of the Lord shall fall therein.

280
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,838
- Won't you never learn any decency?
- We were only gonna talk. Talk.

281
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,197
- The likes of him don't stop at talking.
- The likes of him.

282
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,920
Every man I meet
becomes "the likes of him. "

283
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,038
- He's no good. I see it in his face.
- That's all you see.

284
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,112
Billy Hammond came here twice.
You said he was eviI.

285
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,748
I'm your father.
I've got to keep the dirt away.

286
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,957
- Protect you from the wrong kind of men.
- That's everyone.

287
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,998
Every single man is the wrong kind
of man. Except you.

288
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,117
I promised the next time you hit me,
you'd be sorry for it.

289
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,997
For my mouth shall speak truth...

290
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,516
...and wickedness
is an abomination to my lips.

291
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,514
All the words of my mouth
are in righteousness.

292
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,112
Elsa, I'm sorry.

293
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,594
Receive my instruction and not silver...

294
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,957
...and knowledge rather
than choice gold.

295
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,712
For wisdom is better than rubies.

296
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,400
In about 30 years,
you'll like the feeI of it too.

297
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,519
Pick that up. These mountains
don't need your trash.

298
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,675
Dandy pair of boots you got here.

299
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,277
Juan Fernandez made those boots
for me in San Antone. SpeciaI order.

300
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,716
I had a hell of a time getting him
to put that hole in there.

301
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,793
A fine craftsman, but he never did
understand the principle of ventilation.

302
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,272
I remember Juan. Always felt
the boot should cover the foot.

303
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,396
Short-sighted.

304
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,118
Remember Doc Franklin, the fancy boots
he wore with the flaps over the toes?

305
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,475
Had them made in Boston.

306
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,629
- Old Doc. Know what happened to him?
- I heard he died.

307
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,076
That's right. Old Doc.

308
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,279
Gave 30 years of his life to make
the West safe for decent people.

309
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,433
You'd have wept to see the way they
turned out to pay tribute. Three of them.

310
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,478
The mortician,
the gravedigger and me.

311
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,948
Well, when I'm buried, I won't
much care who comes to the funeraI.

312
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,272
I was commenting on the fairest flower
that grows within the human heart:

313
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,714
Gratitude.

314
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,350
The only gratitude I expect
is my paycheck. Twenty dollars' worth.

315
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,672
- That satisfies you?
- Well, I guess that's all I can hope for.

316
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,114
Is it?

317
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,431
According to my contract, it is.
come on, let's get moving.

318
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,712
- He don't know what you're talking about.
- He will, in time.

319
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,395
When we're ready, let's bend a gun
over his head and take the gold.

320
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,235
You couldn't get close enough
to Steve Judd to saddle his horse.

321
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,231
Well, you could.

322
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,594
Yes, I could, but I won't.

323
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,838
Unless I have to.

324
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,549
I hope heaven forgives us
for earning this easy money.

325
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,032
I seem to remember a man
hankering for some old-time activity.

326
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,795
I'd like to see some old-time mountains.

327
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,560
As I recall, they sure were
a lot easier to get around in.

328
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,188
You sure complain a lot in your old age.

329
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,433
Well, I got something to complain about.

330
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,676
You're earning twice the money
for taking the same risk.

331
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,116
<i>Plus possessing all the other rewards
you've gathered...</i>

332
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,192
...during your years of loyaI service.

333
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,670
A bluegrass thoroughbred,
silver-mounted saddle...

334
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,354
<i>...magnificent wardrobe. I'm envious.</i>

335
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,557
What more could a man expect?
What more can a man hope for?

336
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,792
You forgot to mention
my two-dollar watch.

337
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,030
Waste of breath.

338
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,195
What else could a man expect?

339
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,874
I got to thinking about that one time.

340
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:32,989
I keep records. When I became a lawman,
the world lost a first-class bookkeeper.

341
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,631
So to pass the time one day, I calculated
what it was worth getting shot at.

342
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,075
I figured it at about $ 100 a shot.

343
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,151
You'd have earned quite a sum by now.

344
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,949
Getting hit, I figure that's worth
anywhere from 1000 on up.

345
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,590
- That's 3000 I know you got coming.
- Four brings it up to date.

346
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,833
And when you tally up all those fights
and bushwhackings and cold camps...

347
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,595
...that time in Lincoln County,
five weeks in the hospitaI...

348
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,309
<i>...six months out of work.
You add them all up, and I'd figure...</i>

349
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,155
...I was owed about all the gold
we could carry out of these mountains.

350
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,636
That's something to dream about.

351
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,431
It sure is.

352
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,719
Heck!

353
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,958
- Mind if I keep you company on the trip?
- I don't mind.

354
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,473
- I do.
- I'll second that.

355
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,394
My advice is turn the horse around
and ride back where you belong.

356
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:42,031
I'm not going back to my father. I'm going
to Coarsegold to marry Billy Hammond.

357
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,668
Why do you wanna do
a foolish thing like that?

358
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,034
That's my affair.

359
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,954
She's right, Heck. Our business
is transporting gold, not girls.

360
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,079
Thanks for paying back our hospitality.
Those ham hocks and everything.

361
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,629
I'm a strong believer
in love and gratitude...

362
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,076
...but not strong enough to bring
you under these conditions.

363
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,468
I'll ride by myself.

364
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,870
We can make three miles
before it gets dark.

365
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,678
Right. Got to cover ground.

366
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,149
- Got a gun?
- No, I don't have a gun.

367
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,153
Too bad. This is certain
mountain-lion country.

368
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,389
It sure is.

369
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,028
Well, build a good fire.
It will scare them off.

370
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,428
You both go on ahead.

371
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,195
I couldn't sleep tonight
with the thought of Elsa by herself.

372
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,989
I'll stay with her and meet you
in Coarsegold. Go on ahead.

373
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,077
Those mountain lions,
some don't scare so easy.

374
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,072
Come along, girI.

375
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,750
- Do you remember old man Teaford?
- Oh, yeah.

376
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,159
All night, Logan.

377
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,709
Way up, Logan.

378
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,033
You know, the way you do your hair
looks reaI nice.

379
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,077
You think so?

380
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,789
Pa had me cut it short.

381
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,119
It sort of fits the shape of your head,
when you see it from the side.

382
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,231
Yeah. Like that.

383
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,154
You know, most girls don't know
the first thing about their hair.

384
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,597
I guess you're an authority
on what most girls do.

385
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,194
Well, I've studied the subject.

386
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,119
Not just what they do, but why.

387
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,716
Now, you take this getting married.

388
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,394
Do you think that's such a good idea?

389
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,792
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.

390
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,112
My guess is, you're doing it to get away
from your pa. To get even, maybe.

391
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,910
I guess your guess
is as good as anybody's.

392
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,277
Well, if it's wrong,
how come you ran away?

393
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,431
Because my father
doesn't want me to get married.

394
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,230
Always says he does.

395
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,438
If I can find a decent young man.

396
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,352
But nobody's decent, according to him.

397
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,270
You included.

398
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,356
He said you were no good.

399
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,557
He said the likes of you
don't stop at talking.

400
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,829
You know, he has a point there.

401
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,352
Don't move!

402
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,278
Don't move, Elsa.

403
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,951
No! Heck, no! Let me go! No! No!

404
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,671
Let me go!

405
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,439
My, oh, my.

406
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,792
When I questioned you about him...

407
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,838
<i>...I should've gone more
into the subject of character.</i>

408
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,833
I hope that's a mistake
I won't live to regret.

409
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,230
Good fight. I enjoyed it.

410
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,271
That old man?

411
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,994
That old man is about half rough.

412
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,550
- You learned a lesson, didn't you?
- I surely did.

413
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,278
Got room for another?

414
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,396
Let her fly.

415
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,830
We're not here for romance.
Understand me, son?

416
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,592
Yes, sir.

417
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,351
I hope Mr. Judd didn't hurt you too bad.

418
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,872
- I guess it's kind of my fault.
- What do you mean, "kind of"?

419
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,112
I acted silly. I'm sorry.

420
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,872
I do like you, Heck.

421
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,717
Save the sugar talk for your Billy boy.
I don't need it.

422
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,237
What you need's the kind of girI who'd go
with you to San Francisco or Denver.

423
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,833
And there's plenty of them.

424
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,231
I changed my mind.
You got just what you deserve!

425
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,471
You got something to say?

426
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,474
No, I think she about covered everything.

427
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,073
Lovely place. A beauty spot of nature.

428
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,198
A Garden of Eden for the sore in heart
and short of cash.

429
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,999
We didn't come here
to enjoy the scenery.

430
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,629
The High Sierra Crochet
and Garden Society...

431
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,995
...seem to be having
their weekly meeting.

432
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,311
When we get located, pass the word that
we're in camp and ready for business.

433
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,995
And you, find out where the Hammond
claim is and take her there.

434
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,149
Why me?

435
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,676
Because Steve and I
are gonna be busy collecting gold.

436
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,911
Not too late to change your mind.

437
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:21,551
I came to Coarsegold to be married.
And that's what I'm gonna be. Married.

438
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,429
- Well, good luck, then.
- All the happiness in the world.

439
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,997
Welcome to Coarsegold.

440
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,435
This seems to be the place to find it.

441
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,071
You might be in for a big surprise.

442
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,879
How do you know Billy boy
still wants to marry you?

443
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,271
- What do you care?
- I don't.

444
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,994
This the Hammond claim?

445
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,357
- Who wants to know?
- I do. I'm looking for Billy Hammond.

446
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,751
You found him.

447
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,478
Billy!

448
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,312
Howdy, Elsa!

449
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,311
I can't believe it, honey.

450
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,199
Looks like the girI he's been
going down the mountain to see.

451
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,275
I'll say one thing,
she's sure worth the trip.

452
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,830
Wish I'd got there first.

453
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,231
Looks like a warm one.

454
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,871
- Hey, where's your pa at?
- Back home.

455
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,636
You mean you run off and come
all the way up here just to see me?

456
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,873
See you?

457
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,478
I brought my mother's wedding dress.

458
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,551
- If you still want to.
- If I want to?

459
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,188
If he don't, you got four others
to choose from.

460
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,397
Sweet thing like you
ought to have the pick of the litter.

461
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,393
- No rush about making up your mind.
- Don't listen.

462
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,915
We're gonna get married tonight.

463
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,275
I guess that will be all, Mr. Longtree.

464
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,877
By the way...

465
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,154
...just who is Mr. Longtree?

466
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,356
I rode up with him from the farm.

467
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:28,359
- That's a couple of days on the traiI.
- That's right. Two days, two nights.

468
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,272
A couple of nights.

469
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,159
A couple of nights on the traiI.

470
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,998
Billy!

471
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,677
There were two other men with us
from the bank in town.

472
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:45,392
Besides, Mr. Longtree
was a perfect gentleman.

473
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,471
How come? Something wrong with him?

474
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:53,476
Well, now, I don't think I ever met
a perfect gentleman before, Mr. Longtree.

475
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:07,713
You come back and see us reaI
soon now, you hear, Mr. Longtree?

476
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:27,317
Jimmy, Sylvus, Elder, come on down
here. I want you to meet my woman.

477
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,833
Come on.

478
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,317
Elsa, honey, this is Jimmy.
He's the baby of the family.

479
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,156
And that's Sylvus. He's been doing
our cooking, as you can see.

480
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,835
And the one on the end is Elder.
He's the head of the clan.

481
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,518
I want you to meet my favorite brother.
Henry! Get down here now! Come on.

482
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,638
Henry's sort of our banker,
you might say.

483
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,436
come on, honey, I'll show you my tent.

484
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,319
It looks like you've got
a pretty good claim.

485
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,391
It's a gold mine. Why don't
you come over and take a look.

486
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,596
You're invited too.

487
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,876
- Find Billy Hammond?
- Yeah.

488
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,268
What's he like?

489
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,796
What difference does it make?
She wanted him, now she's got him.

490
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,109
I don't want a shave.

491
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,636
Well, Jimmy, you're gonna get shaved
whether you want to or not.

492
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,190
You've been running around
with that peach fuzz long enough.

493
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,875
We want that girI to know
she's marrying into a family of men.

494
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,838
Hey, Billy.

495
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,676
Thank you, Sylvus.

496
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,238
Now hauI it.

497
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,873
What's that for?

498
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,837
You're leaving.

499
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,635
I see no sense in moving out
just because you're honeymooning.

500
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,793
I don't have time to explain it to you,
brother. Just get out.

501
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,438
I ain't going.

502
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,157
You just did.

503
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,556
Takes care of him.

504
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,437
- I gotta clean up in here.
- Plenty of time for that later.

505
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,673
- No. I wanna do it now.
- No, you don't.

506
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,550
- But the place is filthy.
- It'll wait. It'll wait.

507
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,756
Let go, Billy.

508
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:27,191
- Billy, let me go!
- All right.

509
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,752
Calm down.

510
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,191
Come on, honey.

511
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,151
See you later.

512
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,670
If you need any help...

513
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,116
...fastening up your wedding dress,
you just holler, you hear?

514
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,077
I'll manage.

515
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,353
First drink is best, east or west.

516
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,678
- Let him go. Turn him loose.
- There we go.

517
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,910
Jimmy, we're gonna make
a man of you now.

518
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,672
Say, Henry.

519
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,834
I've been wanting to ask you something.
Something's been on my mind.

520
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,673
Was you planning to bathe
for the wedding?

521
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,558
No, sir.

522
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:16,197
You ain't gonna clean up
for your brother's wedding?

523
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,317
No, sir, I ain't.

524
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,870
I didn't wash when cousin
got wed back home.

525
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,673
That bride didn't seem to mind none.
Did she, Billy?

526
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,269
Now there'll be none of that.

527
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,632
None of what?

528
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,588
You know something, Sylvus?

529
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,957
Billy is getting small-minded
about that woman.

530
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,394
And a might feisty.

531
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,313
A few drinks under his belt,
he'll change his mind.

532
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,358
Now, liquor always did have
a softening effect on Billy.

533
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,034
I hate to get married
with one of my brothers...

534
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,475
...smelling bad enough to gag a dog.

535
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,551
Yeah, that so?

536
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:03,998
You wouldn't want that sweet thing to
think we're less than quality, would you?

537
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,954
The only thing I know
is that after tonight...

538
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,192
<i>...she ain't gonna be able
to think enough about me.</i>

539
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,317
Get him in there.

540
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,193
All right, let him up.

541
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,879
- Henry. Henry.
- Henry.

542
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,712
- Come on now, Henry.
- Easy now.

543
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,474
- We're just funning you, Henry.
- Come on, Henry.

544
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,755
- Easy.
- Come on, Henry.

545
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,388
Put the knife up now.
You're gonna cut yourself.

546
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,596
Is that a smile I see on his face?

547
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,549
Easy now, Henry.

548
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,271
Come on, boys.

549
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,071
Drink to the bride!

550
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,911
Let's have a drink.

551
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,835
Stand up, judge. Here comes the bride.

552
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,719
Come on. Steady now.

553
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,952
Here she is, folks, my bride-to-be.
Elsa, this here's Judge Tolliver.

554
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,713
Pleased to make your acquaintance,
my dear.

555
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,235
And that there's Kate.
She's your bridesmaid.

556
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,277
Welcome to Kate's Place, honey.

557
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:08,276
And these ladies over here
are Sam and Rose and Belle and Candy.

558
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,035
- We're your flower girls, honey.
- You're beautifuI, girls. BeautifuI.

559
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,633
Aren't they beautifuI, Elsa?

560
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,236
Let her roll, Charlie!

561
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,629
Drinks on the house!

562
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:01,434
You come on over and sit down, honey.
You must be tired. Poor baby.

563
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:05,195
We'll all of us have a little drinkie
before the formalities.

564
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,719
Now, you take this. Don't be afraid.
It'll do you good.

565
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,711
Cheers, Elsa.

566
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,079
Heck.

567
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:34,435
Eleven thousand,
four hundred and eighty-six.

568
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,909
That's a far cry
from a quarter of a million.

569
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,071
Fortunes of war.

570
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,199
Hardly worth it.

571
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:45,033
All depends on where you stand.

572
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,992
I guess that's right.

573
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,358
To a poor man, 11,000
is just as far away as 250,000.

574
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:59,759
- Where are you going?
- Out for some fresh air. Any objections?

575
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:05,559
We're gathered here in the high mountains
in the presence of this august company...

576
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:10,671
...to join this man and this woman
in matrimony.

577
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:16,153
Now, I'm not a man of the cloth,
and this is not a religious ceremony.

578
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,629
It's a civiI marriage.

579
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:23,237
But it's not to be entered
into unadvisedly...

580
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,960
...but reverently and soberly.

581
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:30,991
A good marriage has a kind
of simple glory about it.

582
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:35,915
A good marriage is like a rare animaI.
It's hard to find.

583
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,594
It's almost impossible to keep.

584
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,670
You see, people change.

585
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:45,230
That's important for you to know
at the beginning.

586
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,594
People change.

587
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,679
The glory of a good marriage
don't come at the beginning.

588
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,196
It comes later on.

589
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,511
It's hard work.

590
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:03,633
Billy, do you take this woman
to be your lawfuI-wedded wife...

591
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:07,110
- ... until God, by death, shall separate you?
- I do.

592
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,192
And do-?

593
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,554
What's your name again?

594
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,874
Elsa Knudsen.

595
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:18,192
Do you, Elsa, promise to take this man
to be your lawfuI-wedded husband...

596
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,476
...until death does separate you?

597
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,395
I do.

598
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,397
Do you have a ring?

599
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,036
Then, by the authority vested in me,
I hereby pronounce you man and wife.

600
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,792
All right, girls, change your clothes.

601
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,394
Henry! Henry, Henry!

602
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,714
No, no. Sylvus, Sylvus.
Now that's enough, Sylvus.

603
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:23,552
Hey, bartender, pour a little more.

604
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,716
No use standing here
tormenting yourself, son.

605
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,957
come on, I'll buy you a drink.

606
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,269
What a party!

607
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,470
Come on, Billy. Come on, get over there
and get acquainted around.

608
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,708
Let me in there. Let me in there.

609
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,439
- Have fun, honey.
- Billy!

610
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,989
Billy!

611
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,272
come on, now. It's my turn, Sylvus.

612
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,711
- I told you not to do that!
- Now, wait.

613
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,154
You had your turn.

614
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:13,392
It looks like Jimmy's making a man
out of himself.

615
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,996
- I told you not to do that!
- Now, don't be like that, Sylvus.

616
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,108
Oh, come on now.

617
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,716
Now, Sylvus, we got a nice party.
Why don't you behave yourself.

618
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,154
You can't hit my brother!

619
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,638
Don't leave me.

620
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,790
I wish I'd known more
about those brothers.

621
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,552
It's too late now.

622
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,992
- She's married.
- Glad they didn't invite me.

623
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,469
I always cry at weddings.

624
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:49,838
The more I am around you, the more
I can do without your sense of humor.

625
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,434
Come on, break it up!
Boys, get over there!

626
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,512
Now I said, break it up,
and I mean it. Get over there.

627
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,558
Come on, Sylvus, get over here
and behave yourself.

628
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,438
Get over there!

629
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,435
- No, Billy.
- Come on.

630
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,153
No.

631
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,270
Well, now, get on in there!

632
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,355
Easy now, Elsa.

633
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,394
- Listen, Elsa, you come here!
- No, Billy!

634
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,314
No, Billy! No! Not here!

635
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,392
No, Billy!

636
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,438
Now, you straighten out,
you hear me?

637
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,357
Where's Billy?

638
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,238
I've got some prying brothers.

639
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,757
You stay here.

640
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,036
She's mine. She's mine. Let go, Henry.

641
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,873
- Elsa!
- Henry, turn loose of me!

642
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,110
I'm gonna get you.

643
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,113
- Come back, Elsa. Come back.
- Come back, girI.

644
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:35,512
Come on, get your bride.
Billy, get your bride.

645
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,233
Hold it!

646
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,077
Let her go.

647
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,358
- Where are you going with my wife?
- She'll stay with us.

648
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:07,559
- I'm taking her to her father tomorrow.
- Like hell she will.

649
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:16,713
- You can't take a wife from her husband.
- Clear case of breaking and entering.

650
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:22,637
- Elsa's legally married to Billy. Right?
- I now pronounce you man and wife.

651
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,312
- And don't you forget it.
- Go along, Elsa.

652
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,838
Heck.

653
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:35,596
You're not leaving this camp with her.
I'll promise you that.

654
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,393
Go home, Billy.

655
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,395
What happened? You all right, Billy?

656
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,677
Where is she? Where is she?
I'll kill him. I'll kill him.

657
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,831
- Billy!
- Where'd he go with her?

658
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,310
- Come on.
- Why'd you let him get away with her?

659
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,877
The marriage didn't work.
We have to take her to her father.

660
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:14,238
- We've got our hands full already.
- I don't like it any better than you do.

661
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,792
Too big, huh?

662
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,633
What are they doing there?

663
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,554
We're willing to abide
by the court's decision if you are.

664
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,594
We'll abide.

665
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,191
Don't be scared.

666
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,870
- What's wrong?
- Billy Hammond wants Elsa.

667
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,270
They appointed a miners' court
to decide it.

668
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,000
- Miners' court?
- That's the law, places like this.

669
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,037
- Who says?
- They do.

670
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,919
And there's a lot more of them
than there are of us.

671
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:25,914
Billy's very sorry. Swears it
won't happen again. I believe him.

672
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,992
- I wouldn't believe Billy-
- I don't wanna go back.

673
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,628
You were legally married
of your own free will.

674
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,952
Please. You can't let him
take me back. You can't.

675
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,918
But whatever they decide,
that will have to be it.

676
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:41,993
That don't have to be it. She's not
going with him. She stays with us.

677
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,913
She stays here!
We're packing gold, not petticoats.

678
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,914
If she stays, I stay.

679
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,629
Well, let's hope the court
lets her go with us.

680
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,473
Otherwise, we'll be a little short-handed.

681
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,037
All right, gentlemen, we can proceed.

682
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:19,990
In the first place, I married this gaI here
last night, up on the hill in Kate's Place.

683
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,072
- You saw Judge-
- Where can I find Judge Tolliver?

684
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:27,028
- At the end of the hall, mister.
- He married us legaI and proper.

685
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,671
Easy. Sit up.

686
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,478
A little more.

687
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,310
Thank you, sir.

688
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,879
What can I do for you?

689
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,349
Clear up a little technicality,
if you will.

690
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,909
About that marriage last night.

691
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:22,675
They're holding a miners' court.
They'll wanna know if it was legaI.

692
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,994
- Of course it was legaI.
- Well, I believe that.

693
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,311
But the court may want proof,
in the form of a license.

694
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,072
You got one?

695
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,193
Signed by the governor of California.

696
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:51,239
Yes, sir, there's no question at all
about the legality of this document.

697
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:54,520
<i>Now, when you testify
before that miners' court...</i>

698
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,477
<i>...I'm gonna ask you one question:</i>

699
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,837
"Do you possess a license
to marry people in california?"

700
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,629
And you're gonna answer, "No. "
Am I clear?

701
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,717
- That's a lie.
- No, it isn't. You don't possess it. I do.

702
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,757
- Now, see here-
- Listen to me!

703
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,354
You're gonna do as you're told.
Understand?

704
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:19,514
Now, do you recall the question
I'm gonna ask?

705
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,231
And what do you answer?

706
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,833
No.

707
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,111
Very good.

708
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,078
Let's go.

709
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,837
According to the law,
she's still married to Billy Hammond.

710
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,673
You and the law.
She can get it nullified.

711
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:31,400
Will that satisfy
your ironbound code of ethics?

712
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,597
My code satisfies pretty easy, partner.

713
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:38,355
Would it surprise you to know
that I was once a lawbreaker?

714
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:41,796
Well, bless my stars.

715
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:46,795
About the age of that boy back there.
Skinny as a snake and just about as mean.

716
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,951
Ran with the Hole-in-the-Wall bunch.

717
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:52,795
Gun-happy, looking for trouble
or a pretty ankle.

718
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,395
Had the world by the taiI,
so to speak.

719
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,360
Then one night,
PauI Staniford picked me up.

720
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,511
He was sheriff of Madera County then.

721
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:04,719
There'd been a fight, and I was drunk.
Sicker than a fat dog.

722
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,719
He dried me out in jaiI,
and then we went out back...

723
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,350
...and he proceeded to kick
the bitter hell right out of me.

724
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,118
That took some doing.

725
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,397
Not much. You see,
he was right, I was wrong.

726
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,391
That makes the difference.

727
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,152
Who says so?

728
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:23,118
Nobody. That's something
you just know.

729
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:27,432
Anyhow, when I was able to walk again,
I realized I'd learned a lesson from him.

730
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,518
The value of self-respect.

731
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,671
What's that worth on the open market?

732
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:35,628
Nothing to some people,
but a great deaI to me.

733
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,313
But I lost it.

734
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:41,473
These last years, the only work
I was able to get was places like Kate's.

735
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:44,438
Bartender, stick man, bouncer,
what have you.

736
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,750
Not much to brag on.

737
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:49,879
Now I'm getting back
a little respect for myself.

738
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:54,272
I intend to keep it with the help of you
and that boy back there.

739
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:58,117
- Good to be working again, GiI.
- Yeah.

740
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,472
You know what's on the back
of a poor man when he dies?

741
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,073
The clothes of pride.

742
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:08,196
And they're not a bit warmer to him dead
than they were when he was alive.

743
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,231
Is that all you want, Steve?

744
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:19,873
AII I want is to enter my house justified.

745
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,072
Thank you.

746
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,394
Will you stay in town
when we get back?

747
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,988
I'm not just certain. Why?

748
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:52,514
You're right, kid. I've been wasting
my breath. Tonight we move.

749
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,713
- I don't know.
- You don't know what?

750
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:58,634
I started out thinking
he was an old mossback...

751
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:02,031
...but I changed my mind.
Kind of hate to turn against him.

752
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,952
Are you with me or not?

753
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,759
- What will happen to Elsa?
- He'll deliver her.

754
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:10,833
The thing for you to remember
is that we made a deaI.

755
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:12,832
Yes, sir.

756
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,075
It all pointed this way.

757
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:08,518
All that talk about old Doc Franklin,
ungratefuI citizens.

758
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:12,514
- What we had coming but never got paid.
- It's the truth, isn't it, Steve?

759
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:17,151
I knew in my bones what you were
aiming for, but I wouldn't believe it.

760
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,550
I kept telling myself
you were a good man.

761
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:23,717
- You were my friend.
- This is bank money, not yours.

762
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:26,075
And what they don't know
won't hurt them.

763
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:28,435
Not them. Only me!

764
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:35,437
Take off your gun belt
and toss it over here.

765
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,318
What are you gonna do?

766
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,876
You always fancied yourself
faster than me.

767
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,630
Go ahead, draw.

768
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,991
Draw, you damned tinhorn!

769
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,032
That was your second mistake...

770
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:20,112
...and the last chance
you'll ever get from me.

771
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:23,557
I'm gonna put you behind bars, GiI.

772
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,631
You'll play hell getting it done.

773
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,229
Move!

774
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,279
My, oh, my, will you look who's here.

775
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:25,355
Howdy. You made pure fools out of us,
stealing that license from Tolliver.

776
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,478
The judge says there's another one
on file in Sacramento.

777
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:32,076
That means she's still my wife.
come on, honey, let's go home.

778
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:34,151
She stays with us.

779
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:37,194
Looks to me like you been
having some trouble.

780
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:41,797
Looks to me like somebody got
their finger caught in the cookie jar.

781
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:45,396
You're short-handed, old-timer,
but she's all we want.

782
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,674
All we want,
provided we get her now.

783
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:51,559
- You heard me.
- We'll get her, sooner or later.

784
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,039
Like hell you will!

785
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:57,194
You better cut yourself a switch,
Mr. Longtree.

786
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:00,158
I don't think you
could handle me barehanded.

787
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,790
You all are gonna get yourself
a chance to try, directly.

788
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,112
Come on.

789
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,037
I have your word you'll return
your gun when this is over?

790
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,270
Yes, sir, I reckon you do.

791
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:24,470
- I'll go along.
- You bet you'll go along.

792
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,596
- We're moving into the rocks.
- Steve!

793
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,354
Shut up! Move!

794
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,877
Move out!

795
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,471
You're really showing your age.

796
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:25,952
Back in the old days, you'd have checked
those rifles before we left camp.

797
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,350
I'll get around behind them.

798
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,955
Don't waste your time.
They're too far away.

799
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:46,470
He's going around behind us.
Cut me loose and give me a gun.

800
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,830
I'll get a rifle for you.

801
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:53,432
Start shooting.

802
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,274
Sylvus!

803
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:26,835
Sylvus!

804
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:02,632
- He was carrying a rifle.
- Let's get out of here!

805
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:21,234
- Looks like they got Sylvus.
- I know that. come on! We're getting out.

806
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:25,109
You got two brothers dead,
you talk about running?

807
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:26,599
Come on!

808
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,871
I wonder where those other three went.

809
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:09,476
- I hope they're not still following us.
- Calm your fears, honey.

810
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:12,916
My guess is, they gave up
and went back to Coarsegold.

811
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:16,519
Assuming that's so,
I'll have your gun back.

812
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:25,878
Do you hear me, boy?

813
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:39,511
I'm sorry, Mr. Judd.
I guess I was showing off.

814
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:46,397
- What happens when we get to town?
- It's up to the sheriff.

815
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:50,519
He's turning us in.
You know that. So do I.

816
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:59,194
- Ever hear of Folsom Prison, Heck?
- No.

817
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,078
Well, it's solid rock.

818
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,708
<i>During the years we spend there
we'll discuss...</i>

819
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,917
...the events of the past few minutes
at great length.

820
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:11,153
And by the time you get out, you won't
like him any better than I do now...

821
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:13,959
<i>...which isn't one hell of a lot.
Where do I sleep?</i>

822
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:17,756
Up there. I don't wanna see you
till breakfast.

823
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,834
Cut me loose, Steve.

824
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,153
Why?

825
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,796
Because I don't sleep so good anymore.

826
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,920
- Good night.
- Good night.

827
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,112
<i>My father says
there's only right and wrong...</i>

828
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,511
...good and eviI.

829
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,950
Nothing in between.

830
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:11,875
- It isn't that simple, is it?
- No, it isn't. It should be, but it isn't.

831
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,235
What's gonna happen to him?

832
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:19,031
The boy? I'll testify for him.
They shouldn't be too hard.

833
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,314
Will you testify for Mr. Westrum?

834
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:26,078
- No, I won't.
- Why?

835
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:28,513
Because he was my friend.

836
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,389
- How come he don't tie us up?
- What for?

837
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,471
No place to go.

838
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:37,315
He's got the horses,
and he's got the guns.

839
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:40,870
And it wouldn't take long
for Steve Judd to find us.

840
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,595
Wait a minute, kid.
I just had a thought.

841
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:47,753
Well, keep it to yourself.
I'm fed up with you and your ideas.

842
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,677
That's all right.

843
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,798
That's all right.

844
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:16,191
- Morning.
- Morning.

845
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,989
- Where's GiI?
- Gone.

846
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,479
Why didn't you go with him?

847
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:26,630
Because I didn't see any future
in our partnership.

848
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,438
Come on.

849
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,431
Get up there!

850
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,717
You wait here.

851
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:54,754
I'll go down and take a look around.

852
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:14,319
- The old gent's taking quite a chance.
- I don't think so.

853
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,357
Neither does he.

854
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:21,158
I never figured
it would turn out this way.

855
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:26,677
chances are I'll be locked up for a while.
I've got no call to bring it up.

856
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,229
- But maybe when I get out-
- I'll be there.

857
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:51,915
I saw your father. Everything's all right.

858
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,952
What are you doing?

859
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,833
- That's strange.
- What?

860
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:46,118
He goes to her grave every day
but always in the morning.

861
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:47,713
Never in the afternoon.

862
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:52,590
We're going to the ditch.

863
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:53,795
Now!

864
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,990
I walked right into it.

865
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,990
I'm gonna try for the corraI.

866
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:02,799
I got him.

867
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,271
Well, where's the rifle?

868
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:25,074
On the horse.

869
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,593
Bad?

870
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:32,353
Not yet.

871
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,956
Partner, what do you think?

872
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:45,159
Let's meet them head-on, halfway,
just like always.

873
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:47,629
My sentiments exactly.

874
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:50,758
- You, Hammonds!
- What do you want, old man?

875
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:54,112
He wants a shoveI and six feet of dirt.

876
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:56,396
You redneck peckerwoods.

877
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,916
You're too chicken-gutted
to finish this thing out in the open.

878
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,713
Two old men
against all three of you boys.

879
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:11,873
And if them odds ain't enough for you
damned dry-gulching Southern trash...

880
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:15,794
<i>- ... we'll send out the girI.
- We're coming!</i>

881
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:18,110
- You hear me, Henry?
- Yeah, I hear you.

882
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:20,510
You don't have to ask me twice!

883
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,070
Now, you hold on, Billy.

884
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:27,995
- We'll catch them when they raise up.
- Ain't you got no sense of family honor?

885
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:30,432
Start the ball, old man.

886
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,236
How'd we figure?

887
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:06,273
- A thousand dollars a shot?
- Yeah.

888
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:10,232
Those boys sure made me
a lot of money.

889
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:15,548
They put them all in one spot.

890
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:23,319
I don't want them to see this.

891
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,836
I'll go it alone.

892
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,235
Don't worry about anything.

893
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:43,270
I'll take care of it,
just like you would have.

894
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:47,270
Hell, I know that.

895
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,510
I always did.

896
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:53,157
You just forgot it for a while, that's all.

897
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:58,435
So long, partner.

898
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,277
I'll see you later.

899
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:53,669
