Say, Zeke, who was that
he-grizzly that just went by?

315
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,305
Why, that's Red Flack. He's
bullwhackin' for Wellmore.

316
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,732
He's gonna whack Wellmore's
train clear through to Oregon.

317
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:41,437
You reckon you'll ever find
out who downed old Ben?

318
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,990
It's just possible that a certain
low-down coyote left his sign there.

319
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,289
Well, hello, Coleman.

320
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,707
Howdy, Wellmore.

321
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:58,832
I've changed my mind. I'll scout
for that bull train after all.

322
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,879
Well, that's a ray
of sunshine.

for the trip?

Red Flack.

326
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:09,172
A burly ruffian,
but he can maul

327
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,724
the toughest traitor on
the plains into a pulp

328
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,801
without even
working up a sweat.

329
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:14,931
He can do that, eh?

330
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,433
Flack? Ha!

331
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,856
Why, he likes to do it.
But he can run

332
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,229

Here he comes now.

333
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,607
Well, Wellmore,
all ready to start?

334
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,155
Likely you two
have met before.

335
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,654
Nah.

336
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,828
I reckon not.

337

[ Wellmore ] Coleman's
gonna scout for the train.

338
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,916
You understand, Flack,

339
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:40,461
that he's to have final say in all
matters dealing with the Indians.

340
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:46,293
Yes? Well, who's got the final say
about bossin' this bull train?

341
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,969
He understands that
you're the wagon boss.

342
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,047
Yeah. Another thing,
another thing...

343
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,508
Am I supposed to
be wet nurse to them

344
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:56,845

a-crossin' the plains?

345
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,021
The more that goes along,
the better it is

346
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,144
for them and you
in case Indians jump ya.

347
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,602
Well, all right.
All right!

348

Make it clear to him
that I'm wagon boss.

349
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,984
Oh, he understands
that, Flack.

350

[ Groans ]

351
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,991
He seems to be
a right pleasant cuss.

352
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:21,669
He's a ruffian,
but he's a real wagon boss.

353
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,746
Likely he is.

354
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,252
Must've done a big trade
in wolf pelts this year.

355
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,509
Yes, we had a big trade
with the wolfers.

356
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,013
Flack sell you
any of these?

357
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:41,519
Flack? No. He didn't do any
wolfing last winter, I guess.

358
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,476
What outfit did you buy
the biggest bunch from?

359

5,000 dollars' worth.

Lopez,eh?
I guess I don't know him.

362
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,581
I signed him up as a
bullwhacker on the train.

363
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,704
You did, eh?

364
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,956
I'll see you next year.

looking over my outfit?

your history lesson, dear.

Now, uh, how many stars
in the flag?

386
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,918
Twenty-six.

How many stripes?

388
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,846
Thirty.

389
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,050
Now, you know better than that.
There's 13.

The 13 original colonies.
Now remember that.

392

the Columbia River?

[ Honey Girl ] Robert Gray.

395
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,445

be sitting in a rocking chair,

396

when there are
certain persons present.

I think you'll find
we have everything.

398
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,781
Plenty of guns?

399
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:25,164
A rifle and a fowling piece.

400
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,539
How about ammunition?

401
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:27,871
Plenty.

402
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,418
One thing...
I don't see any barrel.

403
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:35,503
A barrel?

404
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,338
Yeah, you'll need
a water barrel.

405
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,139
There'll be long
stretches without water.

406
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,809
I knew we'd forget something.
I'll go get one.

All right.

408
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,807
What I was aiming to tell you was this.
When I came in...

409
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,143
The folks right next
there had an extra one.

Oh, quick work, son.

411
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:59,361
Say, it wouldn't be a bad
idea to take two barrels.

412
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,241
Suppose you go
rustle another one.

413

I'll do that.

414

Oh! Well, that's fine.

Looks like barrels
grow on trees around here.

00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:45,843
Thorpe and Lopez
come in during the night,

940
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:49,396
and early morning, sent a
wagon out for the meat.

941
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:57,568
[ Flack ] Well, a nice
mess you made of things.

942
00:55:57,646 --> 00:55:59,648
Not at all!

943
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:04,195
Two hundred yards running is
considerable of a handicap.

944
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:07,282
Besides,
other days are coming.

945
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,742
Well, don't you
fool yourself.

946
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:11,953
Here he is, here
he is, here he is.

947
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:16,290
Flack, the Injuns
been sending up

948
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,875
smoke signals
for several days.

949
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:20,052
[ Flack ]
Yes, well, I seen 'em.

950
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:23,051
I'll skirmish around with the
Pawnees for a few miles.

951
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,804
Well, go on. There ain't
no one keeping you!

952
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:28,978
No, but you'd better keep
Thorpe and Lopez here.

953
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,975
[ Flack ]
Why?

954
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:34,809
I got a feeling that if either
one of 'em leaves camp,

955
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,732
they'll never come back.

956
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,734
What do you mean by that?

957
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,565
Just the way it sounded.

958
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,901
Hey, look there.
Look there, eh?

959
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,237
[ Native ]

960
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:48,493
[ Breck ] Injuns?

961
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:50,040
[ Whooping ]

962
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:58,007
Lopez, fire
a long shot at 'em.

963
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,833
No fire!

964
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:03,012
[ Native ]

965
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,430
They're Cheyennes.
They want to palaver.

966
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,179
Ah, they look to me
as if they're out for harm.

967
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,807
They will be if
we take a shot at 'em.

968
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:13,890
That'll mean war. I'll go
out and palaver with them.

969
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:17,977
[ Lopez ] Go on. Go on. Maybe
so you no come back, huh?

970
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,062
[ Flack Chuckles ]

971
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,897
Look how queerly
his horse is acting.

972
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,698
Yeah. He's riding zigzag.

973
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:26,948
That's Indian sign
that he wants to palaver.

974
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:30,827
[ Native ]

975
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:34,251
There's the chief riding out
to meet him now for a powwow.

976
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:41,383
[ Native ]

977

[ Native ]

00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:08,156
Zeke! Bascom!

00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,827
[ Native ]

981
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:19,955
How.

982
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,297
This is Black Elk,
an old friend of mine.

983
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:27,175
[ Bascom ] Do they
mean peace or war?

984
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:29,803
Peace, if as long as we march
straight through the Cheyenne country

985
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,929
without stopping to settle.

986
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,605

[ Whooping ]

989
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:04,045
[ Breck ] Now that we're
gonna be friends,

990
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:06,843
they'll probably bring their
families over here to beg.

991
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:09,717
So feed 'em well and treat 'em
right, and we'll have no trouble.

992
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:10,888
[ Man ] All right.

993
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,432
[ Man #2 ] All right. Fine.

994
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:13,850
[ Chattering ]

995
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:14,972
[ Man #3 ] No more
trouble now.

996
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:18,139

00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:35,031
Yes. Yes. Yes.

999
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:37,115
Zeke, what's he
saying about me?

1000
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:40,453
He says that Coleman wants you
for his squaw. [ Chuckles ]

1001
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,333
[ Native ]

1002
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,413
Yes.

1003
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:44,589
[ Continues ]

1004
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:48,510
Yes. And he says Flack
or Thorpe will get you.

1005
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,508
Flack or Thorpe? Why?
Yeah.

1006
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:51,930
Well, Flack's got
a lot of horses.

1007
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,257
[ Native ]

1008
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,283
Miss Ruth,
you shouldn't be riding out

1009
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:17,285
here alone like this
away from the train.

1010
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:18,911
Why not?

1011
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:22,460
Because this is dangerous country
and anything might happen.

1012
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,667
You wouldn't care.

1013
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:26,498
Care? Me?

1014
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:28,504
Why should you care?

1015
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,177
Listen, girl,
if anything happened to you,

1016
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:33,255
it'd be like throwing
my heart to the wol...

1017
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:35,887
[ Whooping ]
Oh, what...

1018
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:40,096
Don't worry. It's Black Elk
and some of his braves.

1019
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:43,644
[ Native ]

1020
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:46,192
Coleman squaw.
Coleman squaw.

1021
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:48,817
Well, he's saying
that I'm your squaw.

1022
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,818
Seems like that's
what he's driving at.

1023
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:53,400
Well, you tell him that you
don't want me for your squaw.

1024
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,827
I've never told
Black Elk a lie yet.

1025
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,870
He knows my
tongue is straight.

1026
01:00:57,946 --> 01:00:59,869
Well, what do you mean?

1027
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:02,997
Well, it wouldn't be true if I
told him I didn't want you.

1028
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:05,170
It happens I do.

1029
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:06,838
And you've
no better taste than

1030
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,507
to tell me that
before all these savages?

1031
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:12,587
I'd tell you that
in front of the whole world.

1032
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:15,513

has gone far enough.

all right, Honey Girl?

It was a pretty bad place,
wasn't it, Breck?

Yeah, but I sort of
liked it.

You know, she don't care
nothin' about me, Zeke.

Well, you can never tell how a
woman feels by the way she acts.

They's all riddles, all of 'em,
and you just gotta guess 'em.

And no matter which way
you guess, you're wrong.

Oh, that's too bad.

What'd you say?

1093
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:09,474
I said, "I am glad."

01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:50,827
before you leave the fort.

1248
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,120
And if I don't?

1249
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:54,198
Well, if you don't...

1250
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:57,001
I'll tell that little filly

1251
01:14:57,076 --> 01:15:01,673
there's a wide-open noose
waitin' for you

1252
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:04,296
in every river town.

1253
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:10,348
[ Groans ] Thorpe, you do your
job before you leave the fort.

1254
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:32,237
Howdy, Henry.

1255
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:34,037
How's things, Coleman?
Just fine.

1256
01:15:34,113 --> 01:15:36,866
[ Henry ] Say,
Black Elk was telling me

1257
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:38,075
that all the Injuns
in the West

1258
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:41,083
was gathering to keep you
all from passin' through.

1259
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:43,631
So they tell me.

1260
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:46,084
Black Elk and the Cheyennes
are going west

1261
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:48,795
to hold a powwow
with the Shoshones.

1262
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:51,051
Yeah, Black Elk tells me
that it's almost certain

1263
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:53,633
that the Cheyennes
will declare war later.

1264
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:54,763
Likely.

1265
01:15:54,842 --> 01:15:57,391
Old Pete Rubideaux was asking
about you a while ago.

1266
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,892
Pete? Where is he?

1267
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:01,724
Camped at the spring yonder
with his new squaw.

1268
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,400
I think I'll ramble
down and see him.

1269
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:04,648
Sure.

1270
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:07,276
Say, Henry, will you put a
new cap nipple on this gun?

1271
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:09,322
[ Henry ] Sure will, boy.

1272
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:11,947
And a new trigger
spring in the pistol.

1273
01:16:12,026 --> 01:16:13,073
All right.

1274
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:14,904
I'll leave 'em with you
while I go see Pete.

1275
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:17,206
Be ready
when you come back.

1276
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:48,688
[ Bascom ] We are about to unite
this loving and devoted couple

1277
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:51,650
in the holy bonds
of wedlock.

1278
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:54,660
Hank Ginnis, do you
take this woman

1279
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:56,408
to be your
lawful wedded wife?

1280
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:57,864
I do.

1281
01:16:57,947 --> 01:17:01,121
Abigail Vance,
do you take this man

1282
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,703
to be your
lawful wedded husband?

1283
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:05,709
[ Giggling ]

1284
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:09,042
She does!

1285
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:43,747
[ Gunshot ]

1286
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:16,113
[ Yawns ]

1287
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,452
Hey, Flack.

1288
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:20,529
Yeah?

1289
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:24,663
You recollect how Coleman done
told you that if Lopez here,

1290
01:18:24,742 --> 01:18:27,871
or Thorpe done strayed off
into the brush,

1291
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:29,546
they weren't likely as how
never come back?

1292
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:30,669
Sure!

1293
01:18:30,748 --> 01:18:33,797
He made some kind of a bluff.
What of it?

1294
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:35,878
Well, uh,
Thorpe strayed out

1295
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:38,464
and he ain't
a-never comin' back.

1296
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:39,548
Hey?

1297
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:40,975
No.

1298
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:45,563
He's done gone back
to his old plantation.

1299
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:47,561
Yeah.

1300
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:54,572
Well, you won't go to
California with Thorpe now.

1301
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:55,819
Why not?

1302
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:57,900
He and Coleman
just met in the brush,

1303
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,577
and Coleman shot him.

1304
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:01,825
Are you sure?

1305
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:03,622
I heard the shot.

1306
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:05,870
And I saw Coleman
standing there over him.

1307
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:07,952
It suits me too.

1308
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:11,789
So he'll even do murder.

1309
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:15,422
And so I pronounce you
man and wife.

1310
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:18,095
And may peace
and happiness be yours.

1311
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:20,343
[ Chattering, Cheering ]

1312
01:19:23,342 --> 01:19:25,936
There's been a murder!
There's been a murder!

1313
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:29,561
A murder? Where?
Where, girl? Who?

1314
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:32,359
Coleman met Mr. Thorpe
in the brush and shot him!

1315
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:35,608
That's a serious accusation, my girl.
Are you sure?

1316
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:36,780
My brother saw it.

1317
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:40,450
Men, we can't have cold-blooded
murderers among us.

1318
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:42,779
There's the man
that shot Bill Thorpe

1319
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:45,034
down like a dog.
Lopez, go and get a rope.

1320
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:46,115
[ Man ] Get a rope.

1321
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:47,199
[ Man #2 ] Yeah,
get the rope!

1322
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:50,412
And just who accuses me
of killing Thorpe?

1323
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:54,169
It, uh...
It was Miss Cameron.

1324
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:57,756
[ Quietly ] Huh.

1325
01:19:57,835 --> 01:20:00,554
You, eh?

1326
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:03,178
So you'd like
to see me hang.

1327
01:20:04,717 --> 01:20:07,266
[ Crying ]

1328
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:10,853
Listen to me, you.

1329
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:13,309
This boy, Coleman, here just
couldn't have killed Thorpe.

1330
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:14,484
Why not?

1331
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,312
'Cause he didn't
have no guns on him.

1332
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:18,147
He left his'n with
Dutch Henry to be fixed.

1333
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:20,528
Coleman and Thorpe were at
odds with the Cameron girl.

1334
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:22,951
If it wasn't Coleman,
who was it who shot Thorpe?

1335
01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:26,122
Since you're aimin' to know,
I'll tell you who done it.

1336
01:20:26,196 --> 01:20:28,949
Who?
I shot that skunk myself!

1337
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:31,001
Coleman's a friend
of his, men.

1338
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:33,078
He's lying to save his neck.

1339
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:35,460
What could Zeke have
against a man like Thorpe?

1340
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:36,540
You want to know that too?

1341
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:37,795
Yes, I want
to know that too!

1342
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:39,001
Well, I'm a-tellin' ya.

1343
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:41,799
I was camped out
pretty close to you,

1344
01:20:41,879 --> 01:20:45,349
and I heared that powwow
you had with Thorpe.

1345
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:46,676
Yeah? What are
you driving at?

1346
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:48,011
Just this.

1347
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:50,687
When a man begins to do a lot
of talkin' about hangin',

1348
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:52,811
he'd better make
pretty sure as to who's

1349
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:54,892
gonna decorate
the end of the rope.

1350
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:55,976
Get my meaning?

1351
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:58,904
Well, Thorpe ain't nothin' to me.
It's no affair of mine.

1352
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:00,606
That's just what
I was a-thinkin'.

1353
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:01,781
Huh.

1354
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,985
And Coleman ain't gonna
do no scouting,

1355
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:06,696
while I'm boss of this train.

1356
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:09,999
I'm leaving him behind.

1357

01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:15,462
[ Man ]
Coleman would never...

1359
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:20,342
Ah, now, we're taking on
a new scout.

1360
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:22,715
Guess again, Flack.

1361
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:25,344
I started with this outfit, and
I'll be with it at the finish.

1362
01:21:25,422 --> 01:21:26,389
Who says so?

1363
01:21:26,465 --> 01:21:27,717
I'm just telling ya.

1364
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,768
I got two reasons.

1365
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:34,019
One is I told Wellmore
I'd scout the train through.

1366
01:21:34,098 --> 01:21:36,897
The other is a little personal
business I aim to transact

1367
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:38,943
at the end of the trail.

1368
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:42,023
See if you can figure out
what that is, Flack.

1369
01:21:46,026 --> 01:21:50,953
Coleman, the settlers are willing to push on.
We'll follow you.

1370
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:53,033
What's this talk
about Injuns?

1371
01:21:53,117 --> 01:21:55,085
It's true.
The Injuns are gathering

1372
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,037
to the westward to stop us
from going through.

1373

prevented our breed of men

from travelin'
into the settin' sun.

If Injuns chance on those wagons,
they'll kill the lot of 'em.

I'm afeard so, Breck boy.

Hello! Hello!

[ Ruth ] Huh!

1577
01:42:06,037 --> 01:42:08,711
I felt someway
that you'd come.

1578
01:42:09,498 --> 01:42:12,047
I'd have been here
a heap sooner if I could've.

1579
01:42:12,877 --> 01:42:14,800
Say, Dave, you'd
better out off that trailer

and throw everything
into one wagon.

1581

All right.

1582
01:42:17,381 --> 01:42:18,633
I'll hitch up Ol' Rhody

and we'll see if we can
get out of here.

1584

After you left,

1585
01:42:24,555 --> 01:42:27,308

about some matters.

01:42:31,812 --> 01:42:33,906
Sorry I was so stupid.

1589

Oh, don't worry, Miss Ruth.
Things did look sort of queer.

1590

I should have known better.

1591
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:44,580
Well, we all get off on the
wrong trail once in a while.

1592

We'll make it
through all right.

1593
01:42:49,538 --> 01:42:52,166
Well, that's fixed.
Can I do something, Breck?

No, I guess not.

You wouldn't listen to me!

[ Flack ] Coleman, huh? He's the
only one that knows the way out,

1610
01:44:08,325 --> 01:44:10,794
and he's deserted us!

[ Man ] Sure, he quit!

1612

If he was here, I'd shoot
him down in his tracks.

[ Breck ] Well, Flack, just when
you gonna start this shootin'?

[ Bascom ] You're just in time, Coleman.
Did you find the Camerons?

[ Breck ] They're over yonder.
What's the trouble here?

No, you're not!

We can't turn back.

1619
01:44:32,892 --> 01:44:35,486
We're blazing a trail
that started in England.

1620
01:44:35,561 --> 01:44:37,063
Not even storms
of the sea could

1621
01:44:37,146 --> 01:44:39,274
turn back those
first settlers.

1622
01:44:39,356 --> 01:44:41,529
And they carried
it on further.

1623
01:44:41,609 --> 01:44:44,453
They blazed it on through
the wilderness of Kentucky.

1624
01:44:44,528 --> 01:44:48,499
Famine, hunger, not even
massacres could stop them.

1625
01:44:48,574 --> 01:44:50,827
And now we've picked up
the trail again,

1626
01:44:50,910 --> 01:44:53,538
and nothing can stop us!
