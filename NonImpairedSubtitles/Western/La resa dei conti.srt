1
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,037
Are you Goolic?
- I've been waiting for you.

2
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,590
Looks like you've had a long trip.300 miles.
We left Texas fast.

3
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,673
So fast we killed our horses. Another
mile of walking would kill us, too.

4
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,633
But we've got the loot here.

5
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,756
Problem is that Corbett's back there,
just behind us.

6
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,196
Ah! Don't be a fool.
We're in Colorado now.

7
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,550
And Corbett can't cause trouble here.
What do you say? Have the times

8
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,430
been good or bad here, Goolic?
- Bad for outlaws.

9
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:45,075
Especially if they're wanted for murder.
They hang them

10
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:49,075
just like they do in Texas.
And, if you don't believe me,

11
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,120
ask Goolic.

12
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,231
Who are you?
- Don't you understand, you idiot?

13
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,233
When we thought we had him behind us!
He was in front all the while.

14
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,318
That's him! That's Jonathan Corbett.

15
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:12,472
If I had one bullet.
Just one.

16
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:54,357
I don't think he understood my rules:

17
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,195
How about you?

18
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,879
Arrest? Or gun?

19
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,433
I challenge you, Corbett.

20
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,350
Don't shoot me, Corbett! I'm innocent!
I didn't shoot during that robbery!

21
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,678
I'm only 30... Don't kill me. Please...

22
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,399
Unbuckle your belt!

23
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:24,116
I never thought,
I'd ever see that wall empty.

24
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:34,996
Yes, sir.
Any good man can live in our state.

25
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,076
All the bad ones will meet
the great Jonathan Corbett!

26
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,995
He's so smart,
he doesn't have to chase the bandits.

27
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,472
They come gunning for him!

28
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,480
Let's celebrate!

29
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,190
Now you can decide
if you want to be a senator.

30
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,231
No more showdowns,
no more bullets whizzing by.

31
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,037
No more chasing bandits in the mountains.

32
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,958
And best of all... no more killing.

33
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,157
How much more do we have to wait?

34
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,236
We're done now, Mr. Brockston.
Don't move...

35
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,599
Don't move...

36
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:03,910
Hello, Corbett. How are you?
- Fine. Thank you.

37
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,556
May I present Mr. Brockston?
- I've heard a lot about you.

38
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,351
Oh? Really? Not as much
as I've heard about you.

39
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,632
Miller, as father of the groom, I would
imagine you'd have some advice to offer.

40
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,717
Hm? Oh, yes. Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.

41
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,678
Well, this is my secretary, Mr. Lynch.

42
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,591
And this is Captain von Schulenberg,
who's a genuine Austrian Baron.

43
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:36,115
My bodyguard.
- Your name is well-known in Texas.

44
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,716
In Austria we also know of it.
- Huh! Professional courtesy.

45
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,035
You're being complemented.
The Baron was the best shot in Europe.

46
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,515
Twenty-three duals, twenty-three widows.
- My complements.

47
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,796
Thank you. I'm sure you've done better.
- Hm. I think,

48
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,871
the Baron is anxious to have you
demonstrate your skill against his.

49
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,755
I stopped playing with guns
when I was a boy of ten.

50
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:08,515
When I use my gun it's because
I have no other choice.

51
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,551
Well... have you met everyone else?
Ah, Melissa.

52
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,357
She's a graceful beauty, don't you agree?

53
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,078
Perhaps you've seen her in theatre.

54
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:25,235
She's the rage of vaudeville.
As you see, I surround myself

55
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:28,712
with the best in every field.

56
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:32,232
Shall we take a walk?

57
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,556
Corbett, I've heard
that you have political ambitions.

58
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:44,798
Some of my friends want me to run for it.
But I don't think, I have much

59
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:48,150
of a chance.
- You don't value yourself enough.

60
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,268
Why, in Texas you're more popular than
Davey Crockett. You've cleaned out

61
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,278
this whole area of outlaws.
It's entirely at your own policing.

62
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,755
Also, one time you were the Sheriff.
- Not officially.

63
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,515
And then, not for long.
My saloon with the gambling tables

64
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:07,515
was more profitable.
- Oh? I didn't know you had a saloon.

65
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,196
A saloon but no luck.
I always lost at poker.

66
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,836
I also didn't know
that during the war you made Colonel

67
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,676
in just 10 months!
- That didn't last long either.

68
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,631
I punched the General's son.
Became a soldier again within the hour.

69
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:29,155
Well, there's light and shadow
in the life of every man.

70
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:33,155
But, history preserves the light
and cancels the shadow.

71
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:37,510
Corbett, I've got a feeling.
With your reputation,

72
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:41,678
you'd have without a doubt
a chance for a position in the Senate.

73
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:45,155
You know what you need?
You need someone to buy you

74
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,388
a campaign of high-level proportions.
- You mean someone like you?

75
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,079
Exactly.
- Why?

76
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:56,275
Corbett, I'm not trying to buy you.
You and only you

77
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:59,877
can help me realize a great project.

78
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,875
The building of a railroad from
the United States to Mexico

79
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:07,477
through Texas.
The only thing I need

80
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:11,918
is a man like you in Senate
to support me with the government.

81
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,991
My railroad would advance this state
up to twenty years in one day.

82
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,196
Are you really interested
in the progress of this country?

83
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,237
Well, let's say I construct
this railroad

84
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:29,115
and make millions of dollars.
But I do construct it.

85
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,916
And only I can.
What do you say, Senator?

86
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,635
Alright. As long as we understand
one another, Brockston.

87
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,196
I'm interested in progress.
Not your personal profit.

88
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,640
Fair enough.

89
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,953
Photographer! A photo here.

90
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:57,956
And so... shall we?
- Don't move, please.

91
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,231
Hey, Chet!
- Well, I'll be! The McCoy brothers!

92
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,632
Where've you two been keeping yourselves?
- Sorry, interfering the festivities.

93
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:20,638
We've been to Lonely Corner.
- Baker's little girl, only 12 years old,

94
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:24,638
she's been raped. And stabbed to death.
We found her body a couple of hours ago.

95
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:28,115
Do you know who it was?
- A Mexican. A young barman

96
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,438
called Cuchillo. "Sanchez, the Knife".
We followed him for twenty miles.

97
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:35,915
But he was too smart to catch.
- He's heading South.

98
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,438
Probably making steady tracks
for that Mexican day labourers camp.

99
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,076
We're going after him.
- Surely! The Sheriff will organize

100
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,398
the posse. Where's Jellico? Jellico!

101
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,992
I'm here.
- Have you heard about this!

102
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,078
Yes, sir.
But the office of the Sheriff

103
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,877
is closed for tonight.
- Jellico!

104
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,558
You carry the star, understood?

105
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:07,635
Miller, what's the sense of us
sending out a thirty man posse

106
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:12,755
when we've got one man
who can do it all by himself?

107
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:16,436
All honest men would be
grateful to the one

108
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:20,637
who brings this murderer to justice.

109
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:29,632
I'll bring you the Mexican. I'll bring
you the Mexican for a wedding present.

110
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,717
Ah, grand. Very generous, Corbett.

111
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,073
All fingers point to you, hm?

112
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,839
This will make you my honorary deputy.
- What do I need this for?

113
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,750
The star becomes your life...
A life with the law.

114
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,278
You will become a legend, my friend.

115
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,752
Wear it.

116
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:05,518
The star can come in handy.
- And shine brightly on your plans?

117
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,959
Hasta Manana.

118
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,789
Don't you need information about him?
- His name is Cuchillo Sanchez

119
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,752
and he'll be headed South.

120
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,232
Who is he?
- Jonathan Corbett.

121
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,237
He's a manhunter.
- What he's doing?

122
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:16,836
He's looking around.
- Is Cuchillo here?

123
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,391
He, Senor!

124
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,273
Maybe I could help you.

125
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:37,270
When someone talks to me
I want to see his face.

126
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,035
Be careful, Signore.
He's quick with a knife, as you can see.

127
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,875
Where is he?
- He's sitting in the barber's chair.

128
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,677
Get back, barber!
I want the man in the chair.

129
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,240
Get up, Cuchillo!

130
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,352
You're the barber aren't you?

131
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,473
Then give me a shave.

132
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,356
March on, brothers!
And hear the Word of God! Onward!

133
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,197
Hey, gypsies! A pack of pigs, all of you!

134
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,710
Take my wife too! I'll give her to you!
- Hey, fellas. Look over there.

135
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,672
Well, well. Look who's in town

136
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,198
The great, great Corbett with a pig.

137
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,596
What have you caught? A big one?
- Not very.

138
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,033
His name is Cuchillo Sanchez.

139
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:56,115
I would have taken him in alive.
But he put up a fight.

140
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,347
It isn't Cuchillo. The boy just happens
to look a lot like him.

141
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,359
This is Paco Molinas. Sentenced
last month for robbery and murder.

142
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,797
Sentence is paid in full. Amen.

143
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,118
But you happened to get the wrong man.

144
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,036
Because his clothes were the same.
And when I found him,

145
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,995
it was my horse he was riding.
- Well, if things were like that,

146
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:32,271
you can stop looking around for Cuchillo.
This one here found him first.

147
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,518
Right now, the vultures have turned
your Mexican in to a heap of bones.

148
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,519
By the way, aren't you missing something?
- Yeah. A Sheriff's star.

149
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,871
You must have lost it...
or maybe threw it away.

150
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,638
Something like that.
- What's wrong?

151
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,158
You look bothered, Corbett.
- I am.

152
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:55,077
I thought, this kid was Cuchillo.

153
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,079
Well, I'm going to find a hotel room.
I'll be leaving tomorrow.

154
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:04,478
There ain't no hotel anymore.
There's nothing left. After the gold

155
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,713
played out of here, those that could
pulled out and left everything standing.

156
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:13,151
But as a favour I'll let you have
the bunk in the front cell. Of course,

157
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,316
for friends there's another arrangement.

158
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,998
The best thing about my work is,
you soon become acquainted with all kinds

159
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,998
of people. Yesterday I had a Mexican
who said, "If you know anyone around here

160
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,998
who could pass for me, I'll give him
a gun and a horse." "Why?" I say.

161
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,998
"Because I want to have some fun."
And, would you believe it?

162
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:35,679
He did!
- Come here!

163
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,997
If you think we've talked enough.

164
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,718
Hm?

165
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,037
Where did you get this?
Who gave you this?

166
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,431
The Mexican. The one I told you.
- When?

167
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,915
Yesterday. Some time around noon.
- What was he like?

168
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,753
Better mannered than you are!

169
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,799
That's for sure. He had a nicer face
than you have, too! So there!

170
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,473
More sympathetic, more gentle.

171
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,119
And he's much richer, too. And if he
hadn't been set on going with the Mormons

172
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,949
he could have stayed all night, too.
Then I could convince him

173
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,310
to stay with me. What a man...
Hey! What a nerve!

174
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:30,115
...and here you will stay,
for this is the Promised Land.

175
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:34,195
Let these words comfort us
for the rest of our journey.

176
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,598
May Divine Providence protect us,

177
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,273
and peace be with you.

178
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,800
Go. Go, my children.

179
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:22,675
If I take my hand away from your mouth,
will you be quiet?

180
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,156
Tell me.
Is there a young Mexican with you?

181
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,671
Yes. A good fellow
who respects the law of God.

182
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,231
Which wagon is he in?
- Why, I put him in mine.

183
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,599
But, right now he's at the spring
getting water with little Sarah.

184
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,391
Little Sarah? How old is little Sarah?
- Thirteen. Why do you ask?

185
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,559
Because this boy is wanted for rape
and murder of a little girl.

186
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:11,396
Hey, Sarah! Sarah!
Come in the water and play.

187
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,757
Come! See the little fishes!
Come on, Sarah!

188
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:22,757
Come on! The water here is shallow.

189
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:26,872
You can touch the bottom.

190
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,319
See? Come on!

191
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,198
No! No, no!
- Sarah, Please! Come on!

192
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:39,672
Don't make me come. Sarah!

193
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,431
Hey listen, we play a game!
You be the Mormon girl

194
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:47,952
and I be the wolf, hm?

195
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:52,517
Oh, what a pretty thing you are, Sarah!

196
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,996
Come over, Sarah! Let me see!
Sarah, come on! So, that's it,

197
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,313
you want to play, hm? Ok!

198
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,599
Get up, Cuchillo!

199
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,428
I could easily kill you right now.
- Please, don't! Don't rob me, Signore!

200
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:42,915
I swear, I'm a poor Mexican!
By the virgin of Kuala Lumpur!

201
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:46,915
Have mercy! Don't kill me!
He wants to rob us! Please!

202
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,437
Don't let him! Don't let him!
- Come on!

203
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,756
Please say you meant that.
You meant it, didn't you?

204
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:11,557
He did mean to rob us, I thought.

205
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,757
He was a bandit-please, say so!
- Si. Si.

206
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,836
He was a bandit.
But, worst of all, he was an idiot.

207
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,313
Adieus, Chica. And gracias.

208
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:48,351
Adieus!

209
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,715
Sarah! Sarah, what happened?
- I had to shoot him. He was a bandit.

210
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:00,195
He was going to rob and kill us!
- Be quiet, Sarah.

211
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,917
Just let me look at him.
Doesn't seem serious.

212
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:11,350
Cuchillo? Where's Cuchillo?
- The boy's escaped.

213
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,911
At least I got here.
Before he hurt your daughter.

214
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,596
My daughter? Sarah?
Sarah's my fourth wife.

215
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,359
Hey! Who are you?

216
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:49,435
Just a poor man
who doesn't bother asking names, Signore.

217
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,435
I'm here because my stomach's empty.
- Go on! Clear out!

218
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:58,875
Go on now. Get moving!
- Si, Signore. But if that man's job

219
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,158
is open now, maybe I could do it?
You don't have to give me much,

220
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,158
but please, I need work.
- We don't have jobs for Mexicans here.

221
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:09,879
Vamoose!
- No, wait!

222
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:15,149
There's a job if he want. It will take
a while for Mike to get patched up.

223
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,158
Is there anything you're best at?

224
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:25,952
I'm best in all I do, Signora.

225
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,036
Perhaps. We'll see.
The man is hungry. Get a plate.

226
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,638
Huh! Not me.
- That's an order.

227
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,440
Right away.

228
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,632
Feel like working now?

229
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,908
I could stop a bull with my two hands.
- Alright. You show us

230
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,997
what you can do.
Now, who's got an idea?

231
00:29:57,079 --> 00:30:00,435
Well, we've got old Barney
who's big and he's sure mean.

232
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:05,470
He's right back there in the old stable.
- Aye. We've got old Barney.

233
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,477
We've been waiting for you, wrangler.

234
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,675
That's old Barney. You said you could
stop a bull with your bare hands,

235
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:36,632
didn't you? Come on! Prove it!

236
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:11,319
I showed you!

237
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,993
Come in the house with me.

238
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:50,997
You can rest. I'll take you there.

239
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,233
Go to hell!
- Come here!

240
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:58,115
As I order. It must be at my orders,
just like the others.

241
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,475
What are you doing, Mr.?
- I'm taking this man with me.

242
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:21,756
He belongs to us.
He's wanted by the law.

243
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,758
In these mountains
we've got no law

244
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:29,677
but the bullets in our guns. Drop dead!

245
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,077
I said, I'm taking Cuchillo with me.

246
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:51,236
You've been told
he's not going back there.

247
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,920
Go back, or die!
- 1...

248
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,038
2...

249
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:21,472
...and 3.
- Stop it!

250
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:32,152
Stop it! Men, put away your guns!
I blame my men for what happened.

251
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,511
They shouldn't have provoked you...
- Corbett.

252
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,035
I rather think, I owe you an apology.
But, I don't want you to believe

253
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:44,515
that this place is so backward
and so barren that the rules

254
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:48,117
of hospitality have been forgotten.

255
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:52,995
That one, he'll go back with you.
Put him in a safe place!

256
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,318
He'll be quite alright, I assure you.

257
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:02,317
May you burn! May your own mother mourn
your birth and pray that you will die!

258
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,877
You'll have some tea? So, I found myself
a widow and alone on this isolated ranch.

259
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,833
It's very lonely for a woman.

260
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:13,915
Especially because I was educated
for finer things.

261
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:22,239
You both may go!

262
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,031
These men talk and act
just like beasts, you see.

263
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,837
It's hard to keep on
holding their respect.

264
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,273
You're doing alright.

265
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,360
What are they doing?

266
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,598
She's got him alone.
- See? She has a new one, you poor idiot!

267
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,159
I bet she didn't wait a minute
as soon as you got out of the room.

268
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,636
Shut your mouth!
- Well, I feel sorry for you poor boys

269
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,316
because you're sharing this time
with me while they're alone.

270
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:14,435
Now that I've been displaced as you have,
I look as stupid

271
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,839
as I thought you were. Hah.
Now he's kissing her soft, white neck,

272
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:24,118
while she runs her fingers up his back.
Soon, there's nothing she won't

273
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:29,029
give to him. And so he reaches out...
- I'll kill you if you don't shut up!

274
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,194
The best thing that's happened in this
place is our meeting one another.

275
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,153
What are you trying to say?

276
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:56,032
Some things are obvious.

277
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:59,719
Intimate games.

278
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:08,116
But to play them
I'd have to take off my gun.

279
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:12,992
Can't you see, though, now?

280
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,917
It's just beginning.
He's quick with a gun.

281
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:22,075
He can take what he wants.
And she'll try to keep him here.

282
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,353
But, if he stays he'll be your new boss.
He'll be here forever. And he'll get rid

283
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,517
of you all, one by one.
Well, I'm in it too.

284
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,719
You know what he came here for.
If I go back there to the gringos

285
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,673
they'll make me hang.

286
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:44,232
But, if we all go after him we can
stop him. Or else, we'll beat them.

287
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,193
And if we do?
- I tell you,

288
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,960
it's in your hands.

289
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:55,995
We wait for him to come out,
then we shoot him first.

290
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:59,197
Give me a gun.
We can kill him together.

291
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:02,799
What do you say?

292
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,759
Listen, Amigo! You'd better be right.
We'll keep an eye on you.

293
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,839
You watch me. You'll see me kill him
even before you can shoot.

294
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,839
Well... a nice idea, hm?
- You keep hoping that. You keep hoping.

295
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:29,230
We need a man here. A man of strength.
A man like you. Stay here, Corbett.

296
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,991
No. You wouldn't be satisfied
with just one man.

297
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:37,677
You enjoy being queen bee too much.

298
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,238
I saw you look at that Mexican outside.

299
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:45,117
You saved him only for one reason:

300
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:48,997
So you could kill him yourself.

301
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,156
You've got one purpose only!
Why is killing so important!

302
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,360
Thanks for the tea.

303
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,480
I can stop them!

304
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,636
Next it's you, Mexican,
if you don't start shooting.

305
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:37,998
I'll try to get around behind him.
If you can keep him busy in front.

306
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:41,077
Right! Go ahead!
- Keep him under fire!

307
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,000
Adieus Cuchillo!

308
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,400
Adieus Americanos!

309
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:07,391
You fool!

310
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:31,950
It's a kid's trick to make you shoot
and waste all of your ammunition.

311
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,833
Where are you?
- Here I am.

312
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,517
No! No, wait, please!
I beg you! I'm afraid!

313
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,111
Please don't leave me here alone!
Please! Please!

314
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:30,392
Don't leave me here alone!

315
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:12,199
Good water, hm?

316
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:19,075
Tastes good, hm, Cuchillo?
- It tasted better a minute ago!

317
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,193
I've been waiting for you.

318
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,511
It's the only water around.
For a hundred miles.

319
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:33,075
Next time you steal a horse,
make sure there's a canteen.

320
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:36,552
Get down! Take it easy!

321
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:40,595
Ah, you stink!
If the pistol didn't make you brave,

322
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:44,310
you couldn't do this to me.
- You talking to me?

323
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,116
And, if it weren't
for those stupid pigs back there

324
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,469
you wouldn't have even a chance
to catch me. I would have made you run.

325
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:57,955
You will never get me by yourself!
Understand? Never!

326
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:01,830
By yourself,
you couldn't catch a limping snail!

327
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,028
Go ahead. When I've finished breakfast,
I'll get the horse and catch up with you.

328
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,397
You must have come out
of your mother rotten!

329
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,632
Hungry?

330
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,437
Well, I guess even animals
have to eat. Here.

331
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,356
What bothers you about me?
- I've got nothing against you.

332
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,838
It's the law you broke that counts.

333
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,791
So that's it. And why does the law count?
- You mean, you don't know?

334
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,879
I do know a law. The one that says
most of the words in two parts,

335
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,029
the masters and the obeyers.
In my country, there was such a law.

336
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:41,515
And no-one ever knew who wrote it.
But we lived under it.

337
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:47,110
Then, one day we listened to Juarez.
And he said we should change it.

338
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,196
Everybody should be nice
and people should stop hating

339
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,877
each other and let the men go free.
Oh boy!

340
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:01,118
We thought it would work for a while.
But nothing really changed

341
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,756
So, you started running again.
- What was the use?

342
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,233
Because I always get stopped.

343
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:13,712
You don't see, what cares I've got.
Bet you don't know, I've got a family.

344
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:17,355
I've got three children! No money
to feed them. My wife is a saint.

345
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,836
She works from morning to night
as a maid to a priest.

346
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,671
And if I was in your place, I bet,
I would say,

347
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,238
"This man should be free to go."

348
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,151
If I was in your place,
I'd say the same thing.

349
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:37,070
But, I wouldn't be foolish enough
to expect another man to believe me.

350
00:48:37,719 --> 00:48:41,428
Listen, don't you think, you owe me
some gratitude? I helped you

351
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:44,471
at the ranch, remember?
- So you could run.

352
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:49,354
You needed the extra time to escape.
- But, if I hadn't you... Besides,

353
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:53,871
I'm not able to kill a man unless
it's a fair fight. I couldn't do it.

354
00:48:54,519 --> 00:48:57,477
But a girl of twelve! Her, you could?

355
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,231
Bravo! Bravo!
May you rest in peace, little snake!

356
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:33,153
You saw it?
- You got a bite.

357
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,635
If you want, I can draw it out.
The only way to get rid of the poison.

358
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,320
It's that fast, hm?

359
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,716
Don't think you have a lot of time.
In another minute

360
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:49,872
it could be too late.

361
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,314
Well?
- It still isn't enough, you know.

362
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,477
Now it should be burnt
to close up the wound.

363
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,238
Ah, yes. We really should burn it.

364
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:25,951
Get up!

365
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:31,239
Turn around!

366
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,032
No tricks!

367
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:58,593
Not me. I told you I couldn't kill a man
in cold blood. Now, maybe you believe it.

368
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:02,116
Go ahead. I'll be dead
in a couple of minutes anyway.

369
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:14,952
See? This is what bit you.

370
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,833
Here. It's yours. You want it?

371
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:28,395
If you don't kill me right now,
it will be the last mistake

372
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:32,157
you ever make.
- Ah, but to kill you

373
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:39,828
is a bigger mistake. If I kill you,
they'll just send another man after me

374
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,839
who's much smarter-much.
Anyway, now you'll owe me something.

375
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,958
I could have killed you, I didn't.
From now on we have an account to settle,

376
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:51,037
you and I. Next time, remember that.

377
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,517
But there won't be a next time.

378
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,153
Because you'll never get me!

379
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,317
Easy. There's plenty here. Don't gulp it.

380
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,278
Thank you.
- You look like someone

381
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:21,594
who took the wrong turn by mistake.
How long have you been out here?

382
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:24,950
Four, five days. I don't know.
- Take it easy.

383
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,000
You've got to rest.

384
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:33,432
I'm after a man, an outlaw.

385
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:38,634
You've got to give me a horse and a gun.
- You're pulling my leg.

386
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:42,469
He's headed towards Mexico and I've got
to catch him before he reaches

387
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:46,558
the border. I haven't any money on me.
But any Sheriff in Texas will vouch

388
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:50,035
for me and pay you.
My name's Corbett. Jonathan Corbett.

389
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:54,799
Alright, Corbett. I'll try to be of some
help to you. You can climb on my wagon

390
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:59,152
and get some rest. But, as soon as you
get to the first town, you can...

391
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,000
Oh, I'm losing time. I need a horse now!
- A horse? You expect me

392
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,149
Oh, I'm losing time. I need a horse now!
- A horse? You expect me

393
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:07,907
to part with one year Loca, here?
You expect me to put my family in danger

394
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:11,076
and risk all I own
so you can chase a bandito?

395
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:15,076
To hell with your bandito!
Let him escape.

396
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,276
Someone else will catch him.
- If he gets in to Mexico...

397
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:22,995
Don't you understand? He's free.
- No. I don't understand.

398
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:29,118
You can come with us. We can write up
an agreement if you want...

399
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,672
I'm sorry.

400
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,192
Leave...

401
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:56,799
Leave him alone!

402
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,559
Ah! You should make some kind of sound,
coming through the door.

403
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,389
Ah! You should make some kind of sound,
coming through the door.

404
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:42,477
One more minute and I'd have hit you.

405
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,320
May I see that knife?
- Of course. But, I ask that you please

406
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,595
May I see that knife?
- Of course. But, I ask that you please

407
00:57:54,719 --> 00:57:59,190
don't show it to Brother Smith. He
doesn't like us to play around like this.

408
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:02,278
Who gave it to you?
- A Mexican boy.

409
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:10,995
Where is he?
- He's not here. He departed yesterday.

410
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:17,038
Gone to Mexico. We're at the border.
- You mean, he crossed it?

411
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:20,199
Yes. And realize that the hunt is over.
- Because you say it is?

412
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:21,518
Yes. And realize that the hunt is over.
- Because you say it is?

413
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:26,357
You don't have the right to cross.
- He belongs to the law of my country.

414
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,836
I'm not talking about the law.
When you cross over that line

415
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:33,395
you'll be as bad as he is.
It becomes a personal matter

416
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:33,760
and you know it.
- It's my job to bring him in.

417
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,911
And you know it.
- It's my job to bring him in.

418
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:46,067
That pistol's been hanging there...
In time, its weight always changes a man.

419
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,559
What do you know about such men?
- Do you mind giving it to me?

420
00:58:47,559 --> 00:58:50,198
What do you know about such men?
- Do you mind giving it to me?

421
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,557
These days they seem much lighter.

422
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:21,710
Oh, did you see that? It's an old habit.
And yet, it's been thirty years.

423
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:27,267
When I first came here, the brothers
promptly made me Brother Smith & Wesson.

424
00:59:27,559 --> 00:59:29,159
But mine was in the holster.
I was running.

425
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:30,592
But mine was in the holster.
I was running.

426
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,756
Anybody who can shoot like you
doesn't have to run.

427
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,638
I hated the mad man that I had become.
And, if it isn't too late, Corbett,

428
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,360
you must stop running. Don't think,
it won't happen to you. Understand?

429
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,156
You must stop running. Don't think,
it won't happen to you. Understand?

430
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:48,236
Yes, I'm sure you do.
But, you don't care.

431
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:52,156
I'm sorry.
- And I'm sorry also. For you.

432
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:07,318
Murdered a child?
- Yes. A little girl.

433
01:00:08,599 --> 01:00:10,760
How old was this girl?
- Twelve.

434
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:11,556
How old was this girl?
- Twelve.

435
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:16,276
Was she good looking?
Was it your sister? Was it your cousin?

436
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:21,557
I never saw her.
- I don't understand.

437
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,559
Why are you following after
this Cuchillo? You must be a Sheriff.

438
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:25,992
Why are you following after
this Cuchillo? You must be a Sheriff.

439
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:29,193
No.
- I don't get you.

440
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:33,194
Captain, in my country, even a private
citizen who believes in justice

441
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,676
can help out the law.
- But now you come to Mexico.

442
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,360
That's right. Now I'm asking you
to help me find this man.

443
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:41,113
That's right. Now I'm asking you
to help me find this man.

444
01:00:42,519 --> 01:00:46,398
Hm. I'm not sure I should.
You can't even prove to me who you are.

445
01:00:47,559 --> 01:00:51,234
There's a telegraph office, isn't there?
Ask San Antonio. They'll tell you

446
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,199
who I am!
- Do you think they'll help you?

447
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:54,394
Who I am!
- Do you think they'll help you?

448
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,397
Look!
You must have heard of this Cuchillo!

449
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,918
I know he lives in your town, Captain.

450
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:05,517
He said his wife worked for the Padre.

451
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,037
That's a big laugh!
The Padre's never let her

452
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:15,038
enter a church. Rosita's worked
in a bordello since she was fifteen.

453
01:01:15,159 --> 01:01:18,515
Yes, I know Cuchillo.
I know that one well. He's one of those

454
01:01:19,159 --> 01:01:20,199
pieces of trash who stood with Juarez.
- Then you're looking for him, too?

455
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:23,953
Pieces of trash who stood with Juarez.
- Then you're looking for him, too?

456
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:27,116
Maybe I am.
But, I'm not doing it for you.

457
01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:31,555
In that case, I'll find him myself.
Goodbye, Captain.

458
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,880
You know, Signore,
there are people I hate even worse

459
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:35,359
You know, Signore,
there are people I hate even worse

460
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,116
than followers of Juarez.
I despise all Americanos.

461
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,995
So you go ahead. It makes no difference
to me who kills who. But, be careful.

462
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:47,679
You do anything in this town to cause
me trouble and I'll cause you more!

463
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:47,917
You do anything in this town to cause
me trouble and I'll cause you more!

464
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:14,920
I'm looking for the wife of Cuchillo.
Her name is Rosita.

465
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,558
I'm looking for the wife of Cuchillo.
Her name is Rosita.

466
01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:37,719
Are you Rosita?

467
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:09,759
Twenty. You pay it now.
- Cuchillo. Are you the wife of Cuchillo?

468
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:14,910
Don't talk to me about
being the wife of that pig!

469
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:19,359
How long has it been since he was here?
- Three months he doesn't think about me.

470
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:23,871
Promised to stay here with me,
then stole all I had. Took my Madonna.

471
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,320
Where's he gone now?
- How do I know? He's probably out drunk,

472
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:27,471
Where's he gone now?
- How do I know? He's probably out drunk,

473
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:31,353
giving another woman what I earned.
But I pray he'll come back.

474
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:35,359
And then I scratch his eyes out!
- Alright! Calm down! When I find him,

475
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,960
there won't be a next time.

476
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:38,312
There won't be a next time.

477
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,356
Why do you say that?
- He won't bother you anymore

478
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:45,830
because he'll be hung for murder.
- Hang my man?

479
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:48,951
Yes.
- You... you want to hang my man?

480
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:51,912
I'll kill you! Filthy scum!

481
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,837
You're defending him?
A rapist! A murderer!

482
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,273
Don't you understand?

483
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,039
Help! Help! Stop him! He's a thief.
He tried to go without paying me!

484
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:08,951
Help! Help! Stop him! He's a thief.
He tried to go without paying me!

485
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:12,435
Do you hear? Don't let him get away! No!
- Wait a minute!

486
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:00,032
I said, no trouble from you.

487
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:01,239
And you didn't listen.

488
01:05:01,239 --> 01:05:03,799
And you didn't listen.

489
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,313
Signora, I'll take you now.

490
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,878
And next you come, and you come,

491
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:28,519
and then, you...

492
01:05:28,519 --> 01:05:31,033
and then, you...

493
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:36,869
One moment. This one comes with us.
- That is, if you have no objection.

494
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:43,590
No problem, Signore. I don't object.
After all, I'm a peaceful man.

495
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:49,429
Damned! Since when do you out a man
in prison because he drank a little?

496
01:05:50,599 --> 01:05:54,751
Is it now a crime for a man to be happy?
- It's a crime to knife people

497
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,280
and then to knife a policeman when he
tries to stop you burn down the place!

498
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,589
And then to knife a policeman when he
tries to stop you burn down the place!

499
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:02,348
No! No! It was those two who provoked me!
And the damn lamp fell out of my hand.

500
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,517
And the policeman
put his hand in my mouth.

501
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:09,435
I only closed it! I swear!
- Stay there! Now, you be quiet.

502
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:16,075
You're a brave man
when there are bars between us! Coward!

503
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:41,471
Guard! Come back!
- What's wrong?

504
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:46,389
Help! This man is mad! Let me out!
I want to get out, away from this maniac!

505
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,356
Tell me what he did to you!
- As soon as you turn your back,

506
01:06:50,519 --> 01:06:51,480
he'll go for me again!
- Better cut out that shouting!

507
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,436
He'll go for me again!
- Better cut out that shouting!

508
01:06:53,559 --> 01:06:56,517
No! I'll keep shouting all night long!

509
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,836
And if I hear you breath again,
I'll shut your dirty,

510
01:07:09,639 --> 01:07:12,597
stinking mouth for you! Understand?

511
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,233
No. You're the coward.

512
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:41,796
I'm not afraid of you,
if that's what's bothering you!

513
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:05,317
Here's the reason for wanting
my cell changed.

514
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:11,308
I've been in this jail before. And the
last time, no-one bothered to search me.

515
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:17,438
Why don't you make a racket?
Do you know, you're a strange person?

516
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:24,470
If I was in you, I'd have the guard
at that door without batting an eye.

517
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:33,908
It's fortunate for me that my country's
walls are made of mud and dried spit.

518
01:09:16,039 --> 01:09:18,997
I'll get you.
You can't run fast enough

519
01:09:23,039 --> 01:09:26,270
for far enough.
I'll hunt you down and kill you

520
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,393
like the rotten beast you are.

521
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,439
Beast? But, what about what you are?
Yes, I'm a beast, alright,

522
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:38,918
because I have to keep running.
But, can I stop to explain myself

523
01:09:39,159 --> 01:09:42,754
without being killed? But, you must
have proof, hm? No, not you!

524
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,839
They told you I was guilty and right
away you start running after me.

525
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,635
You're the beast because you didn't
even ask if it was true or not.

526
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:54,116
But what if I give you a big lie, hm?
What if I tell you,

527
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:58,116
I didn't murder that girl?
It so happens, I know who did.

528
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,916
You'd laugh too if you knew
who that person really was.

529
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,236
Because if you know the truth,
from now on, you'll be the one

530
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:13,628
who's hunted. And you'll find you had
much more fun when you were the hunter.

531
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:22,120
Adieus, Amigo.

532
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,833
You'll never get me, Amigo!

533
01:10:55,279 --> 01:10:57,031
Open up!

534
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:02,038
You're free now! You've been cleared.
San Antonio sent a telegram.

535
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:05,788
You're Corbett, alright.
Now, watch out! I'm not forgetting...

536
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,753
That dirty swine, Cuchillo!

537
01:11:10,119 --> 01:11:14,510
Who else could escape in half an hour?
- So you can continue the hunt.

538
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:19,397
Don't worry. No-one will stop you,
you know. As I already told you,

539
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,876
here in Mexico, the Americanos
and the dogs of Juarez

540
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:28,071
can make trouble for each other
with the approval of the authorities.

541
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:35,515
Isn't it wonderful to visit
such a liberal country?

542
01:12:58,039 --> 01:13:00,872
May I buy it for you?

543
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:10,597
Baron, ask him,
where in the devil he's been!

544
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:20,510
Corbett, I have been looking for you
for two days.

545
01:13:22,199 --> 01:13:25,157
No, Brockston, I don't buy your idea.

546
01:13:26,359 --> 01:13:30,113
Listen to me. When the telegram
from the Mexican police arrived,

547
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,595
So, I took the effort
to come here personally. And I did so,

548
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:37,276
not to listen to your opinion,
but to clear up this matter.

549
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:41,918
In amongst all this is a matter of
a million dollars that never gets billed

550
01:13:42,039 --> 01:13:44,951
because of a despicable Mexican.

551
01:13:45,079 --> 01:13:50,107
The despicable Mexican means more to me
than all your money, or the election!

552
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,798
But, you also belong to me, Corbett.

553
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:01,390
Your influence will touch every corner
of the state and everyone will know

554
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:05,958
that behind you, is my money.
We are in the same boat, Corbett.

555
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:11,156
You'll never become shipwrecked.
I'll be there to anchor you.

556
01:14:11,439 --> 01:14:15,034
To achieve strength like that,
I need you to eliminate the Mexican.

557
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:18,834
I've my own method, Brockston.
- But your own method has failed.

558
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,714
Now we'll use mine. And I guarantee you,
this two-bit Mexican won't get

559
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:25,400
away from me!

560
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:29,755
Oh, our gentle owner of the house
is not easily offended.

561
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:34,030
After all, he hopes to participate
in our railroad transaction.

562
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:37,515
And, furthermore, he doesn't
always understand our language.

563
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:42,676
I've prepared all my men, Signore.
They're all waiting outside the house.

564
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,156
I trust you're still decided on it?
- Well, at least as sure

565
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,831
as you are of wanting to enter
in to my business.

566
01:14:53,079 --> 01:14:56,435
Yet, I understand he's a Mexican,
just like you are.

567
01:14:57,079 --> 01:14:59,912
Oh, no. This man's a bumpkin.

568
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,151
Now, listen to me!
Each one of you will be paid

569
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,878
one hundred pesos. Is that clear?

570
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,037
And the one who catches him
will be paid...

571
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:50,519
one thousand pesos. And remember,
I want this Cuchillo caught!

572
01:15:54,079 --> 01:15:57,958
All you have to do is find him.
But, turn this country upside down

573
01:15:58,359 --> 01:16:01,192
if you have to. But, find him!

574
01:16:02,039 --> 01:16:04,872
Alright now, clear off!

575
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:20,758
How long will you be gone this time?

576
01:16:22,039 --> 01:16:24,599
I don't know.

577
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:28,240
Where'll you go?

578
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,480
Somewhere, I guess.

579
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,959
Bet you don't know, what you can see
when you look out over the Sierras?

580
01:16:39,079 --> 01:16:41,639
A big ocean.

581
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:46,156
Just how big is it?
- Big as a... big as...

582
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:51,797
So big, you can't see to the other side.

583
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:59,117
I'd even have you come along with me.

584
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:03,277
Even to the city?
- Sure. Who knows?

585
01:17:04,439 --> 01:17:07,795
If you come perhaps
we could both steal a boat, hm?

586
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:18,759
No, no, no.

587
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,433
This isn't Cuchillo, you fool!

588
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:44,190
Sorry, Captain Segura. We seem
to be having a lot of trouble tonight.

589
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:47,277
What is it?
- Don Serrano's riders

590
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:51,116
are all over the town,
armed and looking for someone.

591
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,837
Oh! Don Serrano!
Ah, he's a big gentleman.

592
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:00,395
A proprietor.
Pays a big tax and puts out much money

593
01:18:01,039 --> 01:18:03,997
for the church.
- What would we do?

594
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:08,758
Do what I'm going to do, sleep.

595
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:12,917
Those who sleep
don't see and don't hear.

596
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:43,718
May I ask you a question, Corbett?

597
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:49,156
When you are about to kill a man,
what do you look at?

598
01:18:49,319 --> 01:18:52,948
I've asked this question of other men.
And do you know what they always say?

599
01:18:53,079 --> 01:18:55,912
They look at his hands.

600
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:00,713
I don't.
I look at his eyes.

601
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:08,639
Because a moment before he moves
his hand, his eyes betray him.

602
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,633
And you can always read death.

603
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,432
Yours.

604
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,472
Or his.

605
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:12,478
Don't you have too much already?

606
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:18,630
For once, please don't, Chet.
- Cut it out! Go to hell! Leave me alone!

607
01:20:33,359 --> 01:20:35,919
Lizzie! Lizzie!

608
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,231
What's happened?
- I'm packing. I'm going home.

609
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,557
Why?
- Can't stand it anymore. Not with Chet.

610
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:54,475
You do something like that
and I'll wring your neck!

611
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,831
But, our marriage is...
- Yours isn't a marriage.

612
01:20:58,119 --> 01:21:01,748
It's an optional Miller's land,
over which my railroad must pass.

613
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:05,395
Now, that's a lot of capital.
And you know, I don't want anybody

614
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:08,353
to touch that capital.

615
01:21:44,039 --> 01:21:46,872
You! Hey, you!
- Si, Signore?

616
01:21:55,239 --> 01:21:56,797
No!

617
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:01,240
No, Signore! No!

618
01:22:08,119 --> 01:22:11,794
Damn you! You bundler! Didn't you
learn anything the first time?

619
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,276
Did you have to try it once more?
- What are you...

620
01:22:15,439 --> 01:22:19,830
You know damn well what I mean!
- When did you know I was the one?

621
01:22:20,039 --> 01:22:23,395
When it was too late,
after you'd married my daughter.

622
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:28,112
And when those two red-headed friends
of yours showed up at the party.

623
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:32,118
You pretended you'd just saw them.
I knew for a fact that you'd seen them

624
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:36,118
the night before. So, I had
a little talk with them like this.

625
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,754
And what did they tell you?
- The truth. That you got drunk and you

626
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:44,873
raped and killed that little girl
and the Mexican saw you do it. So you

627
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,879
got frightened and you blamed him.
- What will I do if they talk?

628
01:22:51,079 --> 01:22:54,116
Don't worry.
They won't say anything anymore.

629
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:58,555
Did you ask yourself
why you haven't seen them lately?

630
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,037
I thought they'd just gone away.
- They did.

631
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,917
With Baron Von Schulenburg.
- Ah, go ahead.

632
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,759
You idiot! You think I did it for you?
I did it for my daughter.

633
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:14,589
I did it because I don't want anybody
to know that my daughter is married

634
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:18,076
to a murdering violator!
Now, there's only one left.

635
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:22,036
And when it's over tomorrow,
after the Mexican is dead,

636
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:25,638
then I begin to think about you.

637
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:31,518
I don't know! I haven't seen him!

638
01:23:34,039 --> 01:23:37,395
I don't know! I swear it! I swear...
- Where is he?

639
01:23:43,079 --> 01:23:45,912
You bitch! Where is he? Talk!

640
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:52,673
No, no, no, no, no, no! No!

641
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:58,638
Let her go, you pig!
What is it?

642
01:24:06,359 --> 01:24:09,317
Did they hurt you?
- No, no. But, go!

643
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,833
Please, Cuchillo. Run!
- Yes.

644
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,560
Go now! Be careful!

645
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:20,677
We'll be together. You'll see.
- Go now.

646
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:29,550
I designed this holster myself.
I originated it.

647
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:34,196
When I realised that in America,
the swiftness of the draw

648
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:38,320
is more important

649
01:24:39,319 --> 01:24:41,879
than the precision

650
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:45,160
of the shooting.

651
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:15,597
I'll go and see
if they've saddled the horses.

652
01:25:25,399 --> 01:25:28,755
The sun is rising.
It looks like a big ball of blood.

653
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:34,353
I say, that's an omen.

654
01:25:56,079 --> 01:25:58,639
What to choose...

655
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,632
Not those.

656
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:07,392
These.

657
01:26:08,439 --> 01:26:12,432
You know, with one of these you can
stop the charge of a mad buffalo.

658
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:15,597
It explodes inside of the body like that.

659
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:24,156
You didn't know that hunting
was my passion, did you?

660
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:27,916
After making money. I've been
to Africa and India looking

661
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,912
for all types of animals to kill.

662
01:26:32,039 --> 01:26:35,952
But, there's still one type of animal
that I haven't hunted-not with a gun,

663
01:26:36,079 --> 01:26:38,912
that is. The hunting of man.

664
01:26:43,039 --> 01:26:45,872
Should be interesting.

665
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:49,597
It seems he's hidden in the cane fields.

666
01:30:44,199 --> 01:30:47,236
They don't seem able
to pick up his scent.

667
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:50,798
Alright. Keep them here, then. Come on!

668
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:48,198
Stop!

669
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:55,991
No! If we stop, we'll never catch him.
- It's better if we spread out.

670
01:31:56,760 --> 01:32:00,116
Brockston, you take the Baron
and go around that side.

671
01:32:01,239 --> 01:32:04,072
Chet, you come with me.

672
01:32:15,319 --> 01:32:18,675
You men here, go to Signore Brockston!
Where is he?

673
01:33:38,439 --> 01:33:40,999
Better go on foot.

674
01:33:52,399 --> 01:33:55,630
You seem nervous.
- What are you trying to say?

675
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,958
I'm saying, don't make any mistakes!

676
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:01,352
Got that?

677
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:10,360
Over there. Go on!

678
01:35:14,199 --> 01:35:15,951
Hold it!

679
01:35:29,359 --> 01:35:32,954
What a stupid idiot I've been.
I always thought you were an honest man.

680
01:35:33,079 --> 01:35:35,912
And now I see how blind I was.

681
01:35:42,079 --> 01:35:45,037
You will kill me to cover up the truth.

682
01:35:47,119 --> 01:35:50,156
Go on!
- You know, what I'm talking about.

683
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:54,480
Yeah. I know now.

684
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:00,360
Drop the rifle.

685
01:36:19,479 --> 01:36:22,039
No. The blade.

686
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,557
What's happened here?
- You're not blind!

687
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:04,236
Alright. Kill him!
Pull the trigger! Kill him!

688
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:18,147
I could have killed him several times,
Brockston. But, something seemed wrong.

689
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:22,156
And when you involved yourself
personally in this thing,

690
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:26,031
I knew it was wrong.
You thought, I'd shoot first

691
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:30,031
and then think, is that it?
That was your mistake.

692
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:34,996
Alright. You're really
too damn smart to be a Senator.

693
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:41,553
Alright, Baron, he's yours.

694
01:41:19,159 --> 01:41:22,390
Brockston, there's still a bullet
left for you.

695
01:41:25,199 --> 01:41:28,032
Fun's over, Brockston!

696
01:41:47,239 --> 01:41:48,991
Come on!

697
01:41:59,279 --> 01:42:02,510
It's not over yet, Corbett!
I'm the man in charge!

698
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:06,393
You'd miss at that range.

699
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:55,957
There's been enough blood shed,
Mr. Corbett.

700
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:01,673
His adventure is over.

701
01:43:03,319 --> 01:43:05,071
Come on!

702
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,758
I go in that direction.
- I go lower.

703
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:52,678
Adieus!
- Maybe we see us again.

704
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:03,758
Corbett!
You never would have got me!

705
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:07,360
Never! Never!
