1
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:29,080
Winnetou, the chief
of the Apache, is legendary.

2
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:33,360
Thanks to him, it is now peace
in the mountains and the plains ...

3
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,600
in the area between Texas
and New Mexico.

4
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:39,960
It also maaMe an end
's senseless violence.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,920
Peace among all people
is Winnetou's biggest dream.

6
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:48,800
He already knows that peace now
is threatened ...

7
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,080
by adventurers and crooks
that the pioneers are followed.

8
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,240
They sow fear
in the newly created towns.

9
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,200
These gangs appear to be about
for gold to come.

10
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,680
Help, help.

11
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,400
Winnetou ...
-Is it a bit?

12
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,680
Happy, an eagle
always defends its nest.

13
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:58,760
I wanted his eggs not.
I saw it.

14
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:02,000
Apanatschi will find him attractive.

15
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:08,720
If ikje had not heard

19
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,920
Apanatschi, not so close

He is so beautiful.
Help me fit, mother?

28
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,360
I wanted 'n pants for her purchase.

Why kijkjij so innocent?

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,720
A spring from an old eagle nest.

00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:11,720
Come, go now but washing.
Come on.

Herinnerjeje gold mine that still?
Yes. That was long ago.

35
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,120
Nobody could know it
Apanatschi to 21 was.

36
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,280
Now it is where she gets to mine.
Non-do, Mac.

37
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,000
The gold is yours.

38
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,000
You have the right to omdatje

39
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,280
Father, Winnetou. Apanatschi

41
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,800
Father, where is my gift now?
-That 's true also.

Do not shoot.

46
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:29,360
I had the house of Mama.

47
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,400
They also said that you us
had to stalk like a wolf?

48
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,960
More a wet cat.
Send him back, father.

49
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,560
Come on.
-Thanks.

Why are we here?

55
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,520
Come with me, Apanatschi.

56
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,320
Here is the gift
ikje that have promised.

57
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,120
Is that gold?
-Pure gold.

58
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:18,720
I do not.
What does this mean?

59
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,520
Now you're 21, the mine is yours.

that it is gold here?

62
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,800
No, nobody. Winnetou and I
wanted to keep secret.

63
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,800
Did not the mother?

64
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,120
No. Only you, Winnetou
and I know it.

65
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:45,560
Let the gold still lie
where it is.

66
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,000
My sister is a true Apache.

67
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:51,560
Gold makes her happy.

68
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,960
It has the Apache
brought nothing but misery.

69
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,240
If the whites of this hearing,
they come here in hordes to go.

Halt.
Here where we are.

81

I have to go back to the village
of the Apache.

82
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,480
That gold will make you rich
and hopefully happy.

83
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,160
I would love to see your village
and then go with your opjacht.

84
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,320
Apanatschi is always welcome
to the Apache.

85
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,440
Ikje than learning how to raccoons
and brown bears must hunt.

86
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,480

00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:52,440
Look, so gotta use it.

105

00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,040
Do you remember what you should do,

119
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,880

and the guy was hell

131
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,480

All animals in the forest

beaver, marten, raccoon, nerb

133
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,880

00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:08,680
Jemwilde 't even try

A raccoon.
No brown bear.

00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,040
You're really in a kei
strong stories.

144
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Once Pinky 'n bear sees,
he is gone.

145
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,000
Be careful, otherwise I become angry.

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,120
Oh, there is definitely more.
-We go ui_oeken where it is located.

157
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,560
Haller.

158
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,720
Why did you get this gold
concealed?

159
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,720
Because it is my gold.
How did you get it?

160
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,440
Happy that you said
was busy with dynamite.

161
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:06,200
Is it around here?
-Pinky, that is my business.

162
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:10,160
If I tell,
I do that to my neighbor.

163
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:12,160
Calm down, guys.

164
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:15,360
Apanatschi Grant 's what.

165
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,440
Your precarious existence has been purchased.
After your marriage is the mine of you.

166
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,080
Dusjij is rich and I can
Iompen wear?

167
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,200
Well, I am having rags Saturday.

168
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:28,680
Tell us but fast
where it is. Understood?

169
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:31,680
Where is your friend
gone?

170
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:34,920
I still prefer
than that of a fight comes.

171
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:38,280
Ridiculous. That makes no sense.

172
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,360
It is our
and it remains ours.

173
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,040
You can better go.
-No, Mac.

174
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,440
I would not like to
use.

175
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,560
But if you must, I do it.

176
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,120
Nothing thereof.
Get out of here, you guys.

177
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,800
Good night, Mac.

178
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,600
Too bad they now know.

179
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:12,360
Hopefully soon they forget.

180
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:17,440
No Mac, they have gold
and remember that they smelled.

181
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:20,240
It's Apanatschi
birthday gift.

182
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,320
I put the claim tomorrow
in its name.

183
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,240
I leave tomorrow morning.

184
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:37,520
Hi, Mac.
-Good morning.

185
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,680
You are asked opjacht.
-Bring us into the mine.

186
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:46,520
I must first settle what,
but at home we can talk.

187
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,320
No kidding around.

188
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,160
Sloane, you look like a
killer. Creepy.

189
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:54,440
I have obviously no choice.

190
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:58,200
Good guys, I will give you
to bring the gold.

191
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:04,120
You saddle my horse?
I would like to go hunting.

192
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:07,920
That you had thought.
-Listen a minute ...

193
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:10,280
me is not so recommended.

194
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,600
Apanatschi, you know
that you risk?

195
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:15,200
Why then?

196
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,720
Because only your dad and you know
which is where my.

197
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,800
Pinky and Sloane hesitant
nothing in return.

198
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,600
Throw the gun to me.

199
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,040
Why?
I do not anybody hurt them.

200
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,880
Here the gun.
You've been warned.

201
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:41,640
Ellen Fallen cowards.
-Put the gun to us.

202
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,720
Je_, it was fathers rifle.
I know.

203
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,240
No, that is already long in the city.
This shot sounded nearby.

204
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,480
It was his rifle. I am often
Dad opjacht been enough.

205
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,320
We must ui_oeken.
-Apanatschi, listen well.

206
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,960
Well, well ...

207
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,000
I see you. If I
'm not back an hour ...

208
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,240
Old or ask Shafterhand
you want to protect.

209
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,520
But I come back, though.
-Jem, I stay here.

210
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,440
They do not hurt me.
I do not know where it is gold.

211
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,320
Well.
Goodbye.

212
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,720
Jem, where can ikje friend
Old Shatterhand find?

213
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,440
For 's camp of the spoonNeg -
Workers in Rocky Town.

214
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,680
Pinky, Sloane.
Hands up.

215
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,760
Let your arms fall.
Quick Mac, get out.

216
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:03,400
Come on.

217
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:14,520
Why do not you give me bang?
-Not yet.

218
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,280
To save you, brings
Apanatschi us to 't gold.

219
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,480
Then you shoot us
certainly dead?

220
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,520
Bespaarje that ball.
He's been there. Come on.

221
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,560
He has been over an hour away.
I am looking at him.

222
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,000
Maybe he could not find dad.

223
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:40,080
Go find him, Apanatschi.
Go to Old Shatterhand.

224
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,600
Bye, Mom.
-OK, mom.

225
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,120
Day.

226
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,800
Where is Apanatschi?
-No idea.

227
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,640
You lie. Where are the horses?
Say-on, or we kill you.

228
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,760
Where is she?
-Apanabchi is not safe.

229
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,520
They only come back
as her father is punished.

230
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,680
Come on, we find her still.

231
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:12,280
It is fortunately not serious.

232
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,920
Where is Apanatschi?

233
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:20,120
Back to the Old Shatterhand,
zoalsje had said.

234
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,880
Good.

235
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,120
Mac ...

236
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,720
Mac is dead.

237
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:52,560
Sloane Pinky and follow us.
-I can not faster.

238
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,640
Stop, you.

239
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,440
Run, Happy.

240
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,760
Freeze.

241
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,760
Not afraid.
I'm Old Shatterhand.

242
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,680
Are you really Old Shatterhand?
I'm Apanatschi. This is Happy.

243
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:37,280
Our dad is Mac Haller.
Jem sent us.

244
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,080
Why?
Pa-gold has found.

245
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,640
Where is your father now?
-Those claiming our gold mine.

246
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:48,080
I tell him where you are. Go with
Sam 's spoonNegkamp.

247
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,240
I am now,
but I ziejullie later.

248
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,920
Hi, I'm Sam Hawkens.

249
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:56,200
Je_ has much about your told.

250
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:01,560
If he roddelde, is it not true
and gift he is nowhere.

251
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:19,520
What 's onkangst.
They just shoot-on coffins.

252
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:50,240
What will it be, boys?
One-button for the whole thing.

253
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,960
Welcome to the city.
BedanM for the drink.

254
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,160
I had invited you sometimes?

255
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,800
Another whiskey.
That was pretty good.

256
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,520
What? No money
and yet 'n radio show?

257
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,000
He has won poker.
But we are not rich, though.

258
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:28,640
So you have to play poker
won. Fancy a game?

259
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,720
But now he is broke.
-It is therefore quickly.

260
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:39,320
Where hebje 't spent?
-Listen, I do not like lies.

261
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,680
View 's or not he is still somewhere
what money.

262
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,400
Okay, where have you this
found?

263
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,480
Tell me.
-Fast, or I bang you down.

264
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,800
Come on, for the wire it.
Hurry.

265
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,320
I want music.

266
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,760
Where is everyone going?
-That will tell ikje.

267
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:43,320
There is a bunch of thugs
in the city. They ruin everything.

268
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,880
Yesterday, they sherim
shot dead.

269
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,120
Nobody in the city
they can stop.

270
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:53,360
We do not know where,
but we are going.

271
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:56,760
Go to 't railway camp.
Since you are safe.

272
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,120
Doctor, you must continue.
You are indispensable.

273
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,800
Look, if all my patients
leave, I do.

274
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,760
Slide agree on.

275
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,760
Those guys are saying to each other.
Wait.

276
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,240
Go to Sam Hawkens.
He will help you.

277
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,560
Quick, get out.
Not-so hurry.

278
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,200
We have enough coffins
in case something goes wrong.

279
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:25,520
Hopefully we have them
not necessary.

280
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:36,440
Come on baby, don 's sweet.

281
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,080
Come here.
Come here, you shrew.

282
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,880
Help. Let me go.
-Come here, you.

283
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,160
You spoil my dresses.
Wild Men.

284
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,880
Tell me.
-I 't bought.

285
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,440
For 200 dollars.
-Liar.

286
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,120
We have it stolen, HC Pinky?
-Yes, that's true.

287
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,760
From whom did you
that gold nugget stolen?

288
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,480
I'm sorry.
-How to cut du_je me.

289
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:33,200
I know this guy from somewhere.

290
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,280
Where is Miss Bessie?
-Yon.

291
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:55,000
Who is that?
-One or other tree.

292
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:58,200
Should you not leaving here,
Miss Bessie?

293
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:01,440
I can here my girls
not leave.

294
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:06,120
I don nieb care.
You leave all.

295
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:11,120
They would still prefer to kill us
then let us go.

296
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,160
The men here are like
ladies company.

297
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:16,560
We help you escape.

298
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,360
Thanks, but Curly Bill is here
with eighty of his men.

299
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:25,680
It is hopeless.
Lum simply not escape.

300
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:28,240
They are more than a week
in the city, HC?

301
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,040
Well, I did not have a plan,
but do not be afraid.

302
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,360
We think it ieb
in order to get them away.

303
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:41,320
Do Winnetou greetings
from me and take good care of yourself.

304
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,280
I will do, Miss Bessie.
Goodbye.

305
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,360
Tell hoeje that gold is,
whether we pour you full of whiskey.

306
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:54,080
Good. By beverage, you.

307
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,360
Mouth open. All right, kid.
Go on.

308
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,360
Say, do not know ikjou somewhere?
-No, you know. You vergistje.

309
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:11,280
Here is just my size
lit.

310
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,680
He wanted some fun
in the city.

311
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:16,840
Why forced jeje size
whiskey to drink?

312
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,760
Surely this is funny?

313
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,640
Why were you
those kids?

314
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:24,040
The children were walking away.

315
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,280
Mac has Pinky and asked me
to go find them.

316
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,720
If Mac wants his children back,
but he comes to me.

317
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,120
I do not give them to you.
With me, they are also safe, though.

318
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:41,840
Well, like, Curly Bill.
But first you go with me.

319
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,960
One wrong move
and your boss is dead.

320
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,920
Get nothing.

321
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:51,160
Be careful.

322
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,200
Should I smack him down?
Let me know, boss.

323
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:04,240
Now I understand datjij ieb
of those kids wanted to know.

324
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,680
You guys have their dad
certainly slain?

325
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,440
Sloane did.

326
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:10,680
Is that true?
Yes.

327
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:13,240
Come, we go
to the spooMregkamp.

328
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,080
Well done, eropaf then.

329
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:45,120
Haller Mac is dead. He was
by Apanatschi's gold mine.

330
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,880
Where is Jem Brown?

331
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,720
He is injured,
but he is searching for the perpetrators.

332
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,160
That is not so important.
Curly Bill has the killer.

333
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:57,920
Koters who walk everywhere danger.
-Not in Apache.

334
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:00,720
We must now
to the spooMregkamp.

335
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,680
Hurry up, so.

336
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,560
Sam Hawkens, my pony needs
a new horseshoe ...

337
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:44,240
to his right front leg.

338
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,640
Put him ready.

339
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,080
What are you good with horses.
-I just love them.

340
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:57,040
I understand what you mean.
I love a good drink.

341
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:58,920
You bet.

342
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:06,160
There she is.
-Happy is there too.

343
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,320
I take them both into.

344
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,080
Do you she's out.
Non-daytime.

345
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:15,080
Coward, I have meaning
to smack you down.

346
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:24,200
Guys, dinner is ready.

347
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,400
I got hungry as a horse.

348
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:30,680
You stay at them espy
if we track.

349
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,360
Takeoff.
-Everybody on horseback.

350
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:50,600
It tastes even better the soup.
Here, he is also good, though.

351
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,880
Take some dynamite them.

352
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,080
Let me go.

353
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:58,320
Help.
-We go by.

354
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:32,280
Wait. Sloane, go 's look
what is wrong with Pinky.

355
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,760
Hello, Pinky.

356
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,520
I think Pinky drunk.

357
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:42,560
Pinky, what is going on?

358
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,880
Pinky again, get up.

359
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:52,280
Well, Pinky is not any more.
-No, ve_ak is stone dead.

360
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,200
All he verlinkte that I Mac
've slain, it was my size.

361
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,120
What pathetic.
-Poor Pinky. I 'm missing.

362
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,400
You're so again with him.

363
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,000
Let them seem to lie
for the vultures.

364
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,960
Listen up, everybody.
Yesterday was it still safe here ...

365
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:45,080
and now you have Curly Bill
in broad daylight robberies.

366
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:48,640
I also know why they are today
have come.

367
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,800
She wished she and dejongen
whose father they have slain.

368
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,080
From me to you best
action.

369
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:59,680
The job is almost done.
These are murderers Macs.

370
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:02,400
I got them with me.

371
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:07,000
They were my best friends,
Shatterhand.

372
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:09,880
They have slain Mac.
-And you them?

373
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:13,040
No, Pinky was already dead
when he took the rest.

374
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:18,040
Hit in the attack, I think.
Fixed-by Sam Hawkens.

375
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:19,880
Judge has chosen Sloane slain.

376
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:23,040
ls Apanatschi yet seen?
Yes.

377
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:27,800
Why hebje her liberated?
You venNart-guard with baths.

378
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,880
You know I on Saturday
go in the bath.

379
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:34,200
Why would they Happy
have taken?

380
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,080
Happy is their hostage.

381
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:41,400
Men ...

382
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:43,760
how long you take this?

383
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,880
That you never let gang
alone. Come in opposition.

384
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:51,200
Or do you want now
living in fear ...

385
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:55,440
and you have to intimidate them
All you have conducted?

386
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,360
Therefore I say:
Fight violence with violence.

387
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:03,520
We are at end.
-But we will do what you say.

388
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:07,960
Old Shafterhand leads us now.
What should we do?

389
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:10,720
We burn it flattened village
and smoking them out.

390
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,240
Nonsense.
We chase them away.

391
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:18,440
It is not so simple. We must
first those children free.

392
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:21,080
Yes, but how?
-I don 't know.

393
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:26,240
Will my brother
I came to this refurbishment?

394
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,960
No, but want my brother red
it help us?

395
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,960
Would you like to watch
how the wife goes with Macs?

396
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,120
We start as soon as possible.

397
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,720
First the weapons. With bare
we save hands' t understand.

398
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,880
How many guns are there?

399
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:47,040
Say on, guys.
Who has a gun?

400
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:49,560
I got one.
I can handle it.

401
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:51,080
Great.

402
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:55,160
Exactly. Where are we?
-Tomorrow morning.

403
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,160
Yes, sometimes gotta fight.

404
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,560
Dynamite is useful
álsje agreed to deal with it.

405
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:12,880
Here they do not know what a fuse is.
HC, Sam?

406
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:15,560
Do not worry,
we learn 't you do.

407
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:17,080
Okay, Sam?
Yes.

408
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:20,400
What should I do?

409
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:24,000
Nobody kentje. Dad in the city
with Curly Bill.

410
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:27,880
Try to discover
Happy and where are Apanatschi.

411
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:31,320
Watch out. Ask first aid
to 'n friend of mine.

412
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,920
Demand for Bessie.
Say that you know me.

413
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,680
Count on me, Shafterhand.
I am ready to go.

414
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,440
Is that it trusted?
Or should I go?

415
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:46,320
I trust him.

416
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,760
Sam, zatje in really bad when
you had to watch those kids?

417
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,680
How often do I have to explain
that it was Saturday?

418
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,640
Dusje says not waarje pa
that gold was?

419
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,480
Too bad. Really very unfortunate.
-What 's a good thing.

420
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:07,360
Until they talk, we can
what else do with her.

421
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,440
Stop it, Judge.
I said: Hold on.

422
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,280
I get her small.

423
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,280
Hank, get 's what whiskey.
Judge, get that boy on.

424
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:29,680
We just full of casting your brother
whiskey. Then he is a man.

425
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,600
If his stomach can handle it.

426
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,680
I do everything you say.
Please let my brother free.

427
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,080
Now you want to talk, HC?

428
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:42,320
Where is the boss?
They want to pick up children.

429
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,320
Who?
-The entire camp. Tomorrow morning.

430
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,880
Let them come.
We will welcome them warm.

431
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:54,960
Now go back to the camp.

432
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:00,480
Come tell me if they
their plans change, Jim.

433
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:04,520
Here isje tough slaughter omer.
-Put them in the basement.

434
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:09,400
What happened?
Those idiots like us-attacks.

435
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:14,560
Go down, you guys.
-Yes, down. Hurry.

436
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:18,280
Test your weapons and go mamen.
You must be fit.

437
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,120
And no more gezuip.
So everyone will end.

438
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,480
They want to koters. They think
that we have slain their dad.

439
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:30,320
They will be tough fight,
but we are much stronger.

440
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,160
With that lamp, the rafting
you better find.

441
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:43,640
Apanatschi, I'm afraid.

442
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:48,200
I am also scared, Happy.

443
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:52,080
Winnetou and Old Shafterhand
will help us.

444
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:54,480
How do they know where we are?

445
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:58,840
I do not know, but it Lum them
yes. Maakje not worry.

446
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,760
Apanatschi .. .

447
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,760
it is not true
Curly Bill about what father said?

448
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,120
I do not know what you mean.
What did he do?

449
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,320
That he was murdered and all.
-Scare.

450
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,280
Those top men are bad.

451
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,920
Father simply can not ...

452
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,320
Not cry, dear.
Again, not crying now.

453
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,480
Do it for me.

454
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,280
They have not missed me.
They had the pressure.

455
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,840
Good.

456
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,560
Well, I go watch them again.
-Be cautious.

457
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,160
Maakje not worry.
-Good luck.

458
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,840
Hold on.

459
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,160
Hold on, I said.

460
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,360
For tonight you have
gezopen enough.

461
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:20,760
Tomorrow we celebrate something Grob.

462
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,640
And remember for tomorrow:

463
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:28,440
I give it orders to shoot.
Nobody fires until I say so.

464
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:31,160
Who earlier shooting, I bang
in his abdomen.

465
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,080
That circus tomorrow
I have experience.

466
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:36,840
Circus?

467
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,840
Did anybody circus?
Well-and? Are you sometimes seller?

468
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,760
You are wrong.
I am magician.

469
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:03,200
An egg.

470
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,720
And now another one.

471
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,920
Oh, what great.
-One.

472
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,880
Can I drink now?

473
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,560
You call that a trick gunk?
Wait, you agree to.

474
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:28,200
Stop with that nonsense.

475
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,680
Great, pal.

476
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,040
Who are you?
-Give anmoord.

477
00:46:52,199 --> 00:46:56,320
Who are you, gentlemen?
-What 's a loser. He knows they are not.

478
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,400
That is our boss Curly Bill.
We are the gang-Curly Bill.

479
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:02,360
So you're Curly Bill.

480
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,000
Let me hand you the key.

481
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,080
He is good, boss.
Let him go.

482
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:19,880
I go to sleep.
Day.

483
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,520
Two whiskey, please.

484
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,280
I come on behalf Shafterhand.
Where are the prisoners?

485
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,800
Under 't hatch behind me.
-Well, not for long.

486
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,640
Jeff, not flirting with that lady.
As you get further burden.

487
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:42,080
He pays my drink.
Give me five, sir.

488
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:48,360
You doin 'rottrucjes.
Another time, and you go out.

489
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,760
It was just a joke, sir.

490
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,920
Let her go, I said.
Let her go.

491
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:18,120
Search coverage.

492
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,800
Search coverage.

493
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,960
Such fuses are equally venNard
as my beard.

494
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,400
Well, men ...

495
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,680
is the most difficult
not to flee to save.

496
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,120
In the church is fixed
a message from Jem.

497
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,200
It gives me far too quiet.

498
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:14,560
It can 't be fall. Maybe
they knew of our arrival.

499
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:16,360
Come on.

500
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,040
That's it.

501
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:37,440
I would go for someone you
doorje head knalt.

502
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,760
I remain very minute.

503
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,720
That is the sign.
Come on.

504
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,400
Why schootje him dead?
-I 'm really sorry ...

505
00:49:57,559 --> 00:49:59,920
I thought he was a boefwas.

506
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:04,440
Baas, they fall into 't track.
Everybody on-his post. Fast.

507
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,360
Search coverage.

508
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,080
Give me the key now.

509
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,800
Sam, is there someone in that tower?

510
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,680
I do not know.
I go take a look.

511
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:46,040
Curly Bill, the city is surrounded.

512
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:50,040
Geefje on, otherwise we blow
all buildings.

513
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,840
Curly Bill, geefje on.

514
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,480
Come out with your hands
up or we blow you up.

515
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,520
What is it?

516
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:16,400
I get you free. Winnetou
Old Shatterhand and outside.

517
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,000
I knew it.

518
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:21,720
Take the lamp them.
That you will need.

519
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:26,360
The tunnel is off at the church.
Hide in the tower.

520
00:51:26,519 --> 00:51:30,120
Will not you come?
-I stay with my girls. Day.

521
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:42,640
In the church tower.
Shoot him out.

522
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,600
He knalt us.
-Get the kids.

523
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,960
Then they stop with fire.
-Get them.

524
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,320
Break open the hatch.

525
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,160
These children are our salvation.
Fast.

526
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,760
The guy in the tower is a disaster.
There he is not corrupted.

527
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:19,640
Come on, Happy.

528
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:22,840
Watch out.

529
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,240
Quick to the church.
I bring you guys do.

530
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,280
Where is the koters Hank?
-We seem to be crazy.

531
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:47,240
Magician, make yourself nuftig
Hank and get on.

532
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,880
Hank is with the children
to get gone.

533
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:52,760
How?
-And now?

534
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,880
This was their only exit.

535
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:58,240
You told
this was a safe place?

536
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,720
There is another exit.

537
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,080
I've seen that there 's tunnel
is located in the basement.

538
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:08,280
So that they gebruiM.
-Hank is not stupid.

539
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,880
He was smarter than you.

540
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:14,520
He has been safe since no one
knows that tunnel.

541
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:17,760
We look to themselves.
-Good idea.

542
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,400
Take what dynamite them.

543
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,560
How come you here?
-Via 'n tunnel.

544
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,080
Diving.

545
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,440
If I touch Miss Bessie,
Shafterhand is inconsolable.

546
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:46,920
Is that her?
-Can I shoot?

547
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:50,320
Search coverage.
You're now 'n wonderful target.

548
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,920
Shatterhand ...
-U here, Miss Bessie?

549
00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:01,320
Curly Bill and his gang come
out through the tunnel.

550
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,480
I know where the tunnel ends.
There.

551
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:07,240
Yes, exactly.
-Good.

552
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,280
The children were there.
Thanks you. Goodbye.

553
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,320
You want to fit him?

554
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,560
We go up.

555
00:56:27,639 --> 00:56:30,560
If we are,
we go to the hut.

556
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,440
Come on.
Hurry.

557
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:47,720
We must emancipate the tunnel
with dynamite. Give me a little.

558
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:51,880
Then everything can collapse.
Otherwise, we will not leave.

559
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:54,840
Work to be done. Come on.

560
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,960
If we get to the hut,
everything is good.

561
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:07,040
Find cover behind
the embankment. Come on, Sam.

562
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:10,240
Find all coverage
behind the embankment.

563
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,080
Sam, that way.

564
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,880
Everybody behind the wall.
We want to surprise them.

565
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:34,960
Keep your ready
and give me some dynamite rods.

566
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,200
Listen, I throw it
out and he explodes ...

567
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,840
you run out.
-And we tackle the horses.

568
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,320
Keep your ready.

569
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,240
Here.

570
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,680
Dynamite.
Search coverage.

571
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:43,120
Will always be a gold discovery
until you die?

572
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:49,320
As my father did?
It is too large o_er, Jem.

573
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,760
Take me
and forget the gold.

574
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:56,760
I would never even think about it.
-You'll have to, Apanabchi.

575
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:02,000
Listen ...

576
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:04,840
I said datjullie Living
danger.

577
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,320
As long as Happy and you know
where the gold is ...

578
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,240
those guys remain dangerous.

579
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,880
Until we Curly Bill off ...

580
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:15,600
We will not rest time
know.

581
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:20,360
Jeff, I do as long as you save me
love me.

582
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,360
We now go to the Apache.

583
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:32,600
Apanatschi and Happy are
in good hands.

584
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,600
Alsje you to your promise of
a hunting party does, I go to.

585
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:43,960
My promise will take you.
And Happy too. Are you coming?

586
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:45,480
Jem And then?

587
00:59:45,639 --> 00:59:49,480
Which should return to discover
Curly Bill as intends.

588
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:53,720
She said ieb on a hut
stroomopwaarb.

589
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:58,760
Returning is dangerous?
-Hank is still in this basement.

590
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:02,240
I have the keys with me.
I will liberate Hank.

591
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,440
He does not know that I "t was.

592
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:07,560
I pin Curly Bill
something on the sleeve.

593
01:00:07,719 --> 01:00:11,880
Jeff comes with it pretty well, you know.
Gaje with you, Happy?

594
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:21,840
Winnetou, the children
to the Apache.

595
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,880
Which route they take?
-The korbte, I think.

596
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:26,680
Apparently through 'n wildpad.

597
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:31,240
Apache will termagant
never see. That promise ikje.

598
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,120
Everybody off.

599
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,520
And? Do you not?

600
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:40,000
With pleasure.
Come on.

601
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:46,120
Come on.
Continue Create.

602
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:49,760
They have an advantage
on us, so hurry.

603
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,480
Wait.

604
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:21,560
All that waiting, too.
-They may already have passed.

605
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:24,680
So they can volgensjou
fly?

606
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,360
What is happening there.

607
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:42,320
They are their horses,
but where are they?

608
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,880
The black horse is that fast
of Winnetou.

609
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:47,720
I get them all three.

610
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,640
That he wants to correct.

611
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,400
When he heard that shot,
he turns clockwise.

612
01:01:54,639 --> 01:01:56,640
Simple, right?

613
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,560
Do not shoot.

614
01:02:02,599 --> 01:02:05,000
Holy shit.
We are down.

615
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,480
We are beyond their reach.
Come now, but back up.

616
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:22,160
You can well horseback riding.
I'm proud of you.

617
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,440
This young warrior
has a bed.

618
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:47,320
This is Apanatschi.
Her mother Mine-YOTA.

619
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:51,760
Protect her and her brother.
I gotta go now.

620
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,040
It was stupid to meet their trick
stairs and to let them go.

621
01:02:56,199 --> 01:03:01,240
But I will find those children,
and their gold there.

622
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,480
Good morning, boys.
-Neutje, magician?

623
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:06,840
Well, prefer a Neuthard.

624
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,280
Look, this man may well
against drink.

625
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:14,520
Go screening, magician.
That is your bottle. Pour into.

626
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:16,920
That is how I see 't like.
-Not so fast.

627
01:03:17,079 --> 01:03:19,840
Where would you suddenly go?

628
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,600
I want what a friend pour.
-Good job, dude.

629
01:03:35,159 --> 01:03:36,960
Eropaf.

630
01:03:51,239 --> 01:03:53,160
Judge, get first datjoch.

631
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,160
Where are you?

632
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,200
I fish in the stream.

633
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:05,920
She is quite far away.
Pak diejongen now.

634
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:09,800
Well.
Grab him, Hank.

635
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:14,240
Baas, just about gold.
That we share anyway?

636
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,240
This is no time for questions.

637
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,280
You share with me anyway?

638
01:04:25,159 --> 01:04:27,480
I pick him up.

639
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:35,520
Where are you, Happy?

640
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,160
Come here.
-I can not leave. Love you still.

641
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:44,160
Happy, now give anmoord.
Where are you?

642
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,120
Give anmoord, Happy.

643
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,600
Happy, where are you now?
Why do you say no?

644
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,600
Bring him quickly to the horses.

645
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:32,480
Now we deal with that girl.
We have al-datjoch

646
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:35,160
To protect him
she does everything.

647
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:38,320
Hank, let's just gossip.

648
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:43,160
Wildejij a part of it gold?
-That was just a joke.

649
01:05:44,519 --> 01:05:48,160
Curly Bill and I thought
that you felt it.

650
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:51,080
Do not be silly.

651
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:13,760
Jeff, Jem.
-Day, Happy.

652
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,800
What? Diejongen do you know?
-This is the son of Mr. Haller.

653
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,960
Bring him inside.

654
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,040
It seems to be okay.

655
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,200
Listen, magician. ..

656
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,360
I hebje from the beginning
mistrusted.

657
01:06:36,519 --> 01:06:40,320
I do not like your face.
It is fair to me.

658
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:45,800
I just hang salad.
The tree is already done.

659
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,320
I would like to know something smoking.

660
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,600
It is the magician.

661
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:08,280
Stop shooting.
Stop, I said.

662
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:15,800
This does not make any sense?
We have al hetjochie

663
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:21,840
Winnetou, let me go.
I want to help.

664
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,600
You know I can shoot
and it is my brother.

665
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,520
You can not.

666
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:32,800
I would rather you take along on
bear hunting than hunting crooks.

667
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,600
I'm not scared.

668
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:40,080
I know, but if ikje
portability is Je_ angry.

669

Je_ Is everything okay?
That, we hope.

670
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:46,600
If he is back
there will be a big wedding.

671
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:51,640
And if something happened to Happy?
-Dan Jem had already told.

672
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:55,000
Shafterhand say that Curly Bill

673
01:07:55,159 --> 01:07:57,720
I am now going unarmed
to Curly Bill.

674
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,960
DenM you that you do not
without this survives musket?

675
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:06,920
Old Shatterhand know my plan.
It works well established.

676
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:11,000
Do what ikje said.
Come, we must hurry.

677
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:16,040
This is for my brother.
-Bye.

681
01:08:37,399 --> 01:08:39,160
Stop shooting.

682
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:42,280
I let you see it
where the gold is.

683
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:47,280
Tell them not.
It is Apanabchi.

684
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:50,480
I'm not afraid of them.
-I know.

685
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,000
You're very brave.
And I'm trob opje.

686
01:08:54,159 --> 01:08:57,920
Apanatschi gave me this

01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:14,800
Go away.
Want to know where it is gold?

01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:27,280
Happy Hebje seen in the cabin?
-Yes, but when he recognized me ...

692
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:30,040
I had to flee.
They do him nothing.

693
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:34,440
Go 's camp. Apanatschi
verteltje do the rest.

694

01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:39,920

698
01:10:19,479 --> 01:10:21,560
I mean nothing, you know.

699
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:24,600
Look,
Jem and there are Apanatschi.

700
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,720
Beware, Sam.
The guy is part of Curly Bill.

701
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,520
No movement.
Hands up.

702
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,920
Go on, go in again.
Keep moving.

703
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:49,000
That is where the gold whites
be crazy.

704
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:53,840
Come now you promise
Happy and let go.

705
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,840
Take it datjoch them.
He is there.

706
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:27,960
That had you not to do.
I had never let him go.

707
01:11:28,119 --> 01:11:32,760
We have nothing to that as my
he is officially Apanatschi.

708
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:35,800
With what we find,
we go to Kansas City.

709
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,760
Bill, which is crazy.

710
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,920
Everything is possible
of us as ...

711
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:43,600
If we have omiciële Act.

712
01:11:46,039 --> 01:11:47,720
Sure.

713
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,400
They exchange the instrument decides
for datjoch.

01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,360

01:12:15,479 --> 01:12:18,720
Men who follow us.
Be not afraid.

718
01:12:55,239 --> 01:12:56,840
Thank you, brother.

719
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:09,280
Load the horses not to nNaar.
That tunnel is far away.

720
01:13:09,439 --> 01:13:13,000
Judge, I've changed my mind.
We go to Kansas City.

721
01:13:13,159 --> 01:13:17,040
I believe that
no sense.

722
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:19,600
Let the men 's determination.

723
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,240
Would anyone even listening?

724
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:24,640
I want your opinion.

725
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,360
We go with the loot
to Kansas City? Or not?

726
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:33,000
Here is more gold. Why
we need to Mnsas City?

727
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:35,080
Prevent arms.

728
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,760
Opgerot.

729
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:59,880
Now I'm the boss.

730
01:14:00,039 --> 01:14:01,800
Go back to work.

731
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:05,800
Men, Curly Bill comes back
back to the city.

732
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:10,040
We rely on well with him.
Listen to my plan.

733
01:14:10,199 --> 01:14:13,360
We spoornregarbeiders car
us not to crooks.

734
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,400
Call it but army.
-There is no time for.

735
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,280
Come on, who offered to?
-I.

736
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:21,120
And I agree.

737
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:24,680
Shafterhand, take me.
I know I can help.

738
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,680
I believe that serious.

739
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:29,360
Take an example
with this girl.

740
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:34,040
Old Shatterhand, I bring you
like the city to hear.

Thank you.
Good idea.

742
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,960
Men, we run into with Jim.

743
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:55,280
Shoot it once.

744
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:08,040
Divide the dynamite
on the tunnel.

745
01:15:08,199 --> 01:15:12,200
Cover the boxes with bricks,
otherwise they have us.

746
01:15:12,359 --> 01:15:16,640
Sam and Apanatschi, pull a
kruibpoor of chest to chest.

747
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:20,280
Winnetou, come on out.
I want to see the men.

748
01:15:20,439 --> 01:15:21,960
Good. To work.

749
01:15:22,119 --> 01:15:25,280
Hopefully he verprubt not.
-We begin.

750
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:28,440
Apanatschi, bring the gunpowder.
-Here is the bag.

751
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:36,720
Come on, Sam.
Hurry.

752
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:42,200
Bring 't dynamite inside.
Jem controls the rest.

753
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:48,080
From the tower you can
the best seen it coming.

754
01:15:59,319 --> 01:16:01,800
Hide your train behind the church.

755
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:05,160
They may not know
that we are here.

756
01:16:05,319 --> 01:16:07,400
Well, Winnetou.

757
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:17,080
Put 'n gunpowder trail to the church.
-Good, Jem.

758
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:27,200
Only at the gunpowder trail.

759
01:16:40,279 --> 01:16:43,960
I must admit
you approach it right.

760
01:16:44,119 --> 01:16:45,880
I may start him.

761
01:16:46,039 --> 01:16:49,920
Guys, I want our plan
one more time through.

762
01:16:50,079 --> 01:16:53,760
The gang is here
before we know it have.

763
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,400
Listen well, all ...

764
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:01,080
The tunnel runs from the saloon
Under 't square to the cemetery.

765
01:17:01,239 --> 01:17:04,960
We just throwing dynamite

766
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:08,560
Everybody in the houses.

767
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:11,880
They're coming.

I want a drink, what you say.
-Silence. This is not drunk.

771
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:18,600
We need their horses
shoo.

772
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,960
Look at this, Judge.

773
01:18:54,119 --> 01:18:57,080
Look at what is here.
A box of dynamite.

We have come here.
-Move.

776
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,280
Leave it ontplo_en.

777
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:43,560
Be careful.
-Fast to the other side.

778
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:53,760
Judge, come back.

779
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,800
Stay away from my gold
or I kill you.

780
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,040
On the side. They onbnappen.
Here. Catch.

781
01:23:27,239 --> 01:23:29,320
I speak on behalf of the Apache ...

782
01:23:29,479 --> 01:23:32,200
you are our friends
and vice versa.

783
01:23:32,359 --> 01:23:35,360
Forget 's past
and construct a new city.

784
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:38,680
Alsjullie want our help,
you get it.

785
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:44,320
Tomorrow we go together
build a new city.

786
01:23:44,479 --> 01:23:49,640
Listen, that gave us gold
brought nothing but misery ...

787
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:55,400
So I got it to the idea
to our friends to donate.

788
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:58,360
This allows you everything
rebuild.

789
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,080
Mother.
-Here we are again.

790
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:37,560
Come on, kids.

791
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,240
If you can find fine,
I can still stay.

792
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:19,320
I do not know how ikjullie
must thank for your help.

793
01:25:19,479 --> 01:25:22,320
I wish you all
good luck.

794
01:25:22,479 --> 01:25:25,400
I want to witness his best
in your marriage.

795
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:29,840
Do not forget: I can very well
slaapliedjes sing.

796
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,880
Come on.
Only well-opjezelf.

797
01:25:34,039 --> 01:25:35,840
Goodbye.

798
01:25:57,479 --> 01:26:00,040
End
