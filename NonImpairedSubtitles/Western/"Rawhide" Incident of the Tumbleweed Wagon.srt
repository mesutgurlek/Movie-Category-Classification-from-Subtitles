1
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:02,469
Hyah!
?Rollin', rollin', rollin'?

2
00:00:02,504 --> 00:00:04,471
Hyah!
?Rollin', rollin', rollin'?

3
00:00:04,506 --> 00:00:07,674
Keep movin', movin', movin'?

4
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:09,943
Though they're disapprovin'?

5
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:11,444
Keep them dogies movin'?

6
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:13,446
Rawhide?

7
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:15,949
Don't try to understand 'em?

8
00:00:15,984 --> 00:00:18,952
Just rope 'em, throw,
and brand 'em?

9
00:00:18,987 --> 00:00:22,455
Soon we'll be livin'
high and wide?

10
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,458
My heart's calculatin'?

11
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:27,460
My true love will be waitin'?

12
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:31,464
Be waitin'
at the end of my ride?

13
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,467
Move 'em on, head 'em up,
head 'em up, move 'em on?

14
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:36,469
Move 'em on, head 'em up,
rawhide?

15
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:39,472
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in,
ride 'em in, let 'em out?

16
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:41,474
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in?

17
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:44,477
Rawhide...?
?Rollin', rollin', rollin'?

18
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:46,479
?Rollin', rollin', rollin'...?

19
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:47,480
Hyah!

20
00:00:49,017 --> 00:00:50,483
Hyah!

21
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:55,989
Rawhide...!?

22
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:59,492
Hyah!

23
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:12,589
It's not the roundin' up,

24
00:01:12,624 --> 00:01:14,591
and the ropin',
and the brandin' of the cattle

25
00:01:14,626 --> 00:01:17,444
that's the big problem
for the ranchers.

26
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:19,112
It's gettin' them to market.

27
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:22,265
1,500 bone-weary miles

28
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,267
from the southern tip of Texas

29
00:01:24,302 --> 00:01:26,770
to the railhead at Sedalia.

30
00:01:26,805 --> 00:01:28,488
That's where I come in.

31
00:01:28,523 --> 00:01:31,224
Gil Favor's my name...
trail boss.

32
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:58,885
You are the only one I know

33
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,887
can make
a chow bell whisper.

34
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:02,889
Now, don't
play it so dainty!

35
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:04,390
Put some muscle
into it!

36
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:08,895
Chow!

37
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:11,898
Now, don't
crowd up here.

38
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:14,901
There's plenty
for everybody.

39
00:02:14,936 --> 00:02:16,903
How do you always manage
to be the first one

40
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:18,404
in the chow line?

41
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,406
Well, that's
easy, Wishbone.

42
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:21,908
All right,
next man.

43
00:02:21,943 --> 00:02:22,909
Aw, come on, now.

44
00:02:22,944 --> 00:02:24,410
Hurry up.

45
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:25,411
When have I ever
let you go hungry?

46
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:26,412
There's plenty
for everybody.

47
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:27,914
Now move along.

48
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:29,415
You can come back
for seconds.

49
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,917
If that herd stays
fit as it is now,

50
00:02:30,952 --> 00:02:32,919
we'd be in clover
the rest of the way.

51
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,425
Look.

52
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,267
What in the
world...?
What is it?

53
00:02:47,302 --> 00:02:50,136
A tumbleweed wagon.

54
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,138
It's a prison.

55
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:52,939
On wheels.

56
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:55,608
Anybody with half
a head could see that.

57
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:05,919
You ain't gonna let 'em
stop here, Mr. Favor?

58
00:03:05,954 --> 00:03:07,921
It's open country.

59
00:03:07,956 --> 00:03:10,456
Yeah, we better
double guard
the outfit.

60
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:11,658
Never heard of a man
in handcuffs

61
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:14,994
lookin' to run off
with cattle.

62
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,329
Take more than chains

63
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:19,132
to make me feel
safe in my sleep.

64
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:24,420
Whoa.

65
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,923
You mind if we share
the water?

66
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:27,924
Nobody owns it.

67
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,175
My name's Favor-
Trail Boss.

68
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,910
Will Jackson,
U.S. Marshal.

69
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:32,312
My deputy, Art Gray.

70
00:03:32,347 --> 00:03:33,813
Art.

71
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,258
They sure ain't hangin'
the latch string up.

72
00:03:45,293 --> 00:03:47,327
Some of the boys
are a little skittish.

73
00:03:47,362 --> 00:03:48,661
Can't understand
what makes people nervous

74
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,564
around murderers, deserters,
and rustlers.

75
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,500
Me- I just keep
this arsenal as a hobby.

76
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:55,735
Tell your boys
to eat easy.

77
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,337
We'll camp yonder.

78
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,966
This is the last night

79
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:30,470
they're going to
pen us up like hogs.

80
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:37,477
I counted ten trail herders

81
00:04:37,512 --> 00:04:38,478
out there
that I could see.

82
00:04:38,513 --> 00:04:40,980
I dare say all of them
can use a gun pretty well.

83
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:43,483
So?
So, you're not running
this thing.

84
00:04:43,518 --> 00:04:44,484
I suggest that we wait

85
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,486
for a more secluded
opportunity.

86
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:47,987
Secluded opportunity?

87
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:50,490
You'll be gettin' on
my nerves with that
foreign accent of yours.

88
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:51,491
I just want
to make sure

89
00:04:51,526 --> 00:04:53,493
you don't get us all...
Aw, shut up.

90
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,303
Tie the horses.

91
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,904
Outside, guys.

92
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:23,406
Let's go.

93
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:26,409
Come on, son-
over there.

94
00:05:26,444 --> 00:05:28,411
Get outside.
Come on.

95
00:05:28,446 --> 00:05:31,414
Over here, man.

96
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:32,415
Let's go.

97
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,917
Move along.

98
00:05:34,952 --> 00:05:36,919
Right over
here. Come on.

99
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,442
Come on out,
Dallas.

100
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:28,271
Oh, mama, tell me-

101
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:29,772
how do I get
throwed in jail?

102
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:39,582
Well, she ain't been
in that wagon very long.

103
00:06:39,617 --> 00:06:41,734
Takin' up for
collections- bail
the little lady out.

104
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,419
Who's with me?

105
00:06:43,454 --> 00:06:45,421
That's enough.

106
00:06:45,456 --> 00:06:46,923
You whistle at
the herd a bit.

107
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,424
You bring in
the remuda.

108
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:51,928
The rest of you
are hungry.

109
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:52,929
Yeah.

110
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:56,432
All right, in line.

111
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:02,939
Hey, wait a minute!

112
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:06,442
Is that how
you treat a woman?

113
00:07:06,477 --> 00:07:07,944
Woman?

114
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,563
She's more wildcat
than woman.

115
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,566
I don't need
your help.

116
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:16,068
Go ahead.
Be a big man.

117
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,570
She needs chains
more than any of 'em.

118
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:20,072
I just ain't got the heart
to handcuff a woman,

119
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,074
but it's more
than necessary.

120
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,577
I had my way,
they'd never get
out of that wagon.

121
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:25,511
They'd stay there
and choke

122
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,513
on their own foul air.

123
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:28,714
Who is she?
Married to Luke Storm.

124
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:29,999
You must've heard
of him.

125
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,552
That's just poor judgment,
not a crime.

126
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:33,753
Except that she's
part and parcel

127
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:35,421
of his gang
of cutthroats-

128
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:38,391
she and those other two.

129
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,179
My chow line's
all set up.

130
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:44,931
My pleasure
to send some over.

131
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,532
No, it's best they have
their chores to do.

132
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:47,733
Thanks anyway.

133
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:49,986
Go ahead, Art.

134
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:51,487
You and Virgo
unhitch the wagon.

135
00:07:51,522 --> 00:07:53,990
Now, look here, I...
I don't want none
of your lip.

136
00:07:54,025 --> 00:07:56,492
Bunker Hill's still eatin'
your dirty red neck.

137
00:07:56,527 --> 00:07:58,778
We won that battle,
remember?

138
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,180
And we won the war,
remember?

139
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:03,583
Go on, both of you.

140
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,585
We've been on the road
with that human dynamite

141
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,086
four days.

142
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:09,088
We cover
a 300-square-mile area.

143
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:11,090
We pick up freight
from ten jails.

144
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,092
Seems it's be simpler
for the judge to travel

145
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:14,594
rather than the
other way around.

146
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,596
Not enough judges.
Too many jails.

147
00:08:16,631 --> 00:08:18,965
Not enough unbiased juries.

148
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,883
Now, don't be
too hard on Art.

149
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,385
It's edgy work.

150
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,303
It does seem
to be that.

151
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:35,481
We make our move
tonight.

152
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:36,682
How?

153
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:37,884
We got an ace.

154
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,485
Wouldn't it be better to wait

155
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,888
until Luke catches up
and sets us loose?

156
00:08:41,923 --> 00:08:44,690
Luke ain't gonna catch up
with us this trip.

157
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:47,159
Number one, suppose
he don't come back from Mexico

158
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:47,960
when he was supposed to?

159
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,161
Number two,
this lawman

160
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,163
ain't takin' us
to the judge at Mammoth.

161
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:51,964
He switched his route.

162
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,566
Now, there is a judge
at Fort Gregg.

163
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:54,767
I figure
he's headed there.

164
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:57,553
You have to palaver
to unload blankets?

165
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,061
Dallas...

166
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,113
...you got any objections

167
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:10,316
to seein' that
deputy go under?

168
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:12,318
No objections.

169
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:26,816
Yeah, this sure reminds
me of home, Norm.

170
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:30,319
The short-grass country
of the Mississippi Valley.

171
00:09:30,354 --> 00:09:33,756
Yep. There, the water
makes you thirsty,

172
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,175
the squirrels live
underground,

173
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,177
and the spiders got fur.

174
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:40,580
Yeah, I sure miss it.

175
00:09:40,615 --> 00:09:42,982
There's something
downright attractive

176
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:45,384
about the plain cussedness
of nature.

177
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,337
The plain cussedness
of nature.

178
00:09:48,372 --> 00:09:49,839
Is that why you
sold whiskey

179
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,991
to Indians
on government
land, Matt?

180
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,393
To improve on the
cussedness of nature?

181
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:57,263
To improve on the state
of my pocketbook, Marshall.

182
00:09:57,298 --> 00:09:59,265
You know, I ain't given
to worry much,

183
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,232
but this boy, here...

184
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,635
Well, he'll be safe
in government prison

185
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,436
for a spell.

186
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,037
Out of pure patriotism,

187
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:08,441
this lad left his home in
Philadelphia to join the army.

188
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,209
He's scared to
death of horses,

189
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,845
so naturally, they put
him in the cavalry.

190
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,113
Now, he begged- he begged-

191
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:15,615
to be moved
to the foot soldiers.

192
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,616
But oh, no.

193
00:10:16,651 --> 00:10:18,117
That'd make
too much sense.

194
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:19,752
So, he deserted.

195
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:22,154
Now, is it fair
to put him in prison?

196
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:25,157
Well, that... that ain't
for me to say, Matt.

197
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,660
Oh, I wasn't scared
of horses.

198
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:29,328
It was the first sergeant.

199
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:31,464
He thought
I was scared of horses

200
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:33,499
because I didn't know
how to shoe them.

201
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:37,169
So, he got on me,
and he kept on me...

202
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:39,405
till I took him apart.

203
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,776
Bad apart, with my bare hands.

204
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:47,079
After that,
it was either him or me,

205
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:50,132
and I knew
he could have me hanged.

206
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:52,018
So, here I am.

207
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:53,786
You put him in
with hardened criminals,

208
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,604
and that's the way he'll end up.

209
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:57,590
Like that fish-blooded
Englishman over there

210
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,908
that killed his own wife.

211
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,860
Well, you act
the boy's lawyer, Matt,

212
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:03,362
and maybe the judge'll
see it your way.

213
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,103
And so, Virgo,
due to an accident of birth,

214
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:14,707
you see me in chains
in this American wilderness

215
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:17,910
instead of in
my ancestral castle in England.

216
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,912
Simply because
my twin brother was born

217
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:21,514
35 minutes before I was

218
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:24,350
and gives me an allowance
to stay out of England.

219
00:11:24,385 --> 00:11:26,485
I don't know
why you waste
your breath, Sinclair.

220
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,587
He don't understand
a word you're saying.

221
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:31,624
I've got to talk
to someone.

222
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,428
And, uh, he doesn't talk back.

223
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,401
You see, Virgo, I understand
why tribal custom demanded

224
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:45,204
that you kill that brave
who disgraced your sister.

225
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:51,877
It's theAmericans
who are the real barbarians.

226
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:54,480
I give you my word
as an Englishman

227
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:56,082
that somehow I'll...

228
00:11:56,117 --> 00:11:57,416
I'll strike off your bonds.

229
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:02,221
Come and get it!
Come and get it!

230
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,929
They're all bedded down
and contented, boss.

231
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:44,730
Good.

232
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,070
You restless?

233
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:52,571
Huh?

234
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,073
Oh, uh... I just thought

235
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:57,076
I'd take a little walk
before I turned in.

236
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:59,078
Better walk
in the other direction.

237
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:01,080
You never saw
a woman in troubleyet

238
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:03,482
you haven't fallen for.

239
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:05,651
Look, Mr. Favor...

240
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:08,053
after dark, when I'm
not on night herd,

241
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:09,655
my time's my own, huh?

242
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,657
Mixing with
the tumbleweed wagon

243
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:13,259
is mighty touchy,

244
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:16,061
but I'm not telling you,
just asking.

245
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,666
Do you think the drovers
will try to stop us?

246
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:38,918
We don't
bother them.

247
00:13:38,953 --> 00:13:40,519
Why should they
bother us?

248
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,542
Out of the way, Dallas.

249
00:13:47,543 --> 00:13:48,394
Art!

250
00:14:14,038 --> 00:14:14,920
Still hands off?

251
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,689
The horses!

252
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,528
I'll get her.

253
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,814
Let go of me!

254
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,058
I'd be obliged if you'd secure
that chain for me.

255
00:15:09,093 --> 00:15:11,110
There's a padlock
at the end there.

256
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,693
I didn't want
to get involved.

257
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:30,562
They always say
the same words.

258
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:34,366
The men who killed my father,
they said the same thing.

259
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,368
They didn't want
to get involved.

260
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:37,970
Sorry.

261
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:39,972
Oh, they
were, too.

262
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:41,974
Vigilantes.

263
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:45,978
Especially when they found out
they'd hanged an innocent man.

264
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:48,781
They were sorry.

265
00:15:48,816 --> 00:15:50,783
But my father was dead.

266
00:15:50,818 --> 00:15:54,386
They had to pin
it on somebody.

267
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:57,189
They didn't know
he was going blind.

268
00:15:57,224 --> 00:16:00,392
He couldn't even see anybody,
let alone shoot them.

269
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,394
And the people
in town-

270
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,797
the decent folk-

271
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:05,998
all they wanted to do

272
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,201
was just-just forget
that it ever happened.

273
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:11,603
Well, I didn'tletthem forget.

274
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:16,008
There were a lot of empty places
at supper tables in that town

275
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:17,609
before I was through.

276
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:18,410
Mr. Favor?

277
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,079
Deputy's dead.

278
00:16:20,114 --> 00:16:22,081
Marshall ain't
got far to go.

279
00:16:44,053 --> 00:16:45,054
His bleeding stopped?

280
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:46,555
Yeah.

281
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,058
You've got to...

282
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:51,060
you've got to get my prisoners
to Fort Gregg.

283
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:52,561
I'm sorry,
Marshall.

284
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:53,562
I got a herd
to deliver.

285
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,681
There's nobody else, Mr. Favor.

286
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:57,733
I got to get to a doctor.

287
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:59,234
You know it.

288
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,737
There's a doctor at Gregg.

289
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:03,489
You got no choice.

290
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,491
Oh...

291
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:07,493
You've got a choice.

292
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:08,994
To stay alive.

293
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,196
The man who rode out of here

294
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,999
is on his way
to Luke Storm, my husband.

295
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,018
He's likely
on our trail already.

296
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:24,126
All right, Marshall.

297
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:26,128
I'll get your wagon
to Fort Gregg.

298
00:17:26,163 --> 00:17:28,130
Be smart, trail boss.

299
00:17:28,165 --> 00:17:30,132
Walk away with your cattle.

300
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:32,101
Oh, I almost forgot
to thank you, Dallas,

301
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:34,303
for your prayer
over the grave.

302
00:17:34,338 --> 00:17:37,589
I didn't realize you had so
much... religious training.

303
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:39,992
Enough to know
that them who pray the loudest

304
00:17:40,027 --> 00:17:41,193
are the biggest hypocrites.

305
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:42,795
That's true, too.

306
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,731
You'll never get us
to Fort Gregg.

307
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:48,550
Who knows?

308
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:55,057
Herd's inclined
to move, Mr. Favor.

309
00:17:55,092 --> 00:17:56,058
All right.

310
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:58,560
Take care
of his horse, Quince.

311
00:17:58,595 --> 00:18:00,446
I'll be taking
the prison wagon

312
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:01,864
into Fort Gregg.

313
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:03,682
Well, you can't do it alone.

314
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:05,067
Yeah, I'll need
a hand.

315
00:18:05,102 --> 00:18:07,069
I wouldn't mind seeing
Fort Gregg.

316
00:18:07,104 --> 00:18:08,871
Sorry.
You've got the herd.

317
00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:10,122
Rowdy, you want
to see a fort?

318
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:11,623
I sure do.

319
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:13,559
You'll need eyes
in the back
of your head.

320
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:14,827
Boy, I got 'em.

321
00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:19,114
Undo the chain,
get the prisoners
in the wagon.

322
00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:20,616
Right.

323
00:18:20,651 --> 00:18:24,703
Figure two,
maybe three days to Gregg.

324
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:27,106
We'll catch up with you
at Prescott Crossing.

325
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:29,541
Get the Marshall set.

326
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,479
Please get
in the wagon, ma'am.

327
00:18:33,514 --> 00:18:34,680
Take your dirty,

328
00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:36,482
cow-herdin'
hands off of me.

329
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:38,150
Look, I said
to get in the wagon.

330
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,152
I'll get in
when I want to.

331
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:41,920
I saidnow.

332
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,922
Let go of me!
Put me down!

333
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,924
I'll kill you.
Let me go!

334
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,927
Oh, let me go!

335
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,267
Watch out,
just watch out.

336
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,736
Next time,
your eyes come out.

337
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:05,744
All right, pick up your
blankets and move in.

338
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:31,270
You're not going to
put him inthere.

339
00:19:31,305 --> 00:19:33,572
Well, he can't ride
sitting up front.

340
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:35,557
We haven't got
an extra wagon.

341
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,559
There's no place
else to put him.

342
00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:57,079
All he needs
is bandage changing,

343
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:58,697
so the wound doesn't fester.

344
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:01,099
If he lives,

345
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:04,303
figures the judge will take that
into consideration.

346
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:07,422
Rowdy?
All right, then.

347
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,424
We'll see you
at Prescott Crossing.

348
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:10,425
All right, Pete.

349
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,927
See you later, Pete.
Good luck.

350
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:13,428
See you later,
Mr. Favor.

351
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,503
Yah!

352
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,009
Yah!

353
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,979
Lennie, look.

354
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:07,983
Dallas.

355
00:21:08,984 --> 00:21:10,485
How did you do that?

356
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,437
That cowhand forgot
to snap the lock.

357
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,439
Now, look, we've got
to delay this wagon.

358
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:16,942
Wait a minute-
you don't want him
to hear, do you?

359
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,947
He can't hear a thing.

360
00:21:21,982 --> 00:21:23,448
Lennie, the man
with the brain-

361
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:25,450
he'll find a way
to delay this wagon.

362
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:26,952
Aw, shut up.

363
00:21:26,987 --> 00:21:28,453
Give Luke time
to catch up.

364
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:29,955
He'll set us free.

365
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,957
Luke won't find it so easy.

366
00:21:31,992 --> 00:21:34,593
The man on this wagon
is no fool.

367
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:37,229
If they get us
to Fort Gregg,
we're finished.

368
00:21:37,264 --> 00:21:38,630
We got one chance.

369
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:40,932
We have to delay this wagon
until Luke catches up.

370
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,434
Now, you do what
I tell you, maybe...

371
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,936
Look what you've
accomplished so far.

372
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,942
Bandage shook loose.

373
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,944
The wound's open.

374
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,447
Uh, hey, hand me
one of those rags there.

375
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,654
Nobody hates a lawman
like you, Dallas.

376
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,426
The Mexicans sure make
a sharp blade.

377
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,430
All right, now...

378
00:22:28,465 --> 00:22:30,932
the deputy, we know,
is buried here.

379
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:32,751
There was some shooting,

380
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:34,986
so we know maybe
somebody was shot.

381
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,738
Lennie or the marshal.

382
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:39,124
Yeah, or maybe Dallas.

383
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,994
If it was Dallas...

384
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:50,502
It'll cut a man in
half just as easy.

385
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:56,007
That herd you talked about
picked up the Sedalia Trail.

386
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,010
Their wagon's headed
for Fort Gregg again.

387
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:04,015
Somebody's driving,
somebody's riding guard.

388
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,519
Wait a minute.
Marshal's got some help.

389
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,020
Yeah.

390
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,530
All right, Jed,

391
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,032
let's mount up
and keep going.

392
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,847
Our trail's cleaner
than a hound's tooth.

393
00:23:51,882 --> 00:23:55,133
There's another way
to Fort Gregg.

394
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:57,269
It's rougher but shorter.

395
00:23:57,304 --> 00:23:58,570
About a mile
east of here.

396
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:00,205
I don't figure anybody
can beat us in.

397
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,008
Maybe not.

398
00:24:03,043 --> 00:24:05,811
We'll just go along
this stream a ways.

399
00:24:05,846 --> 00:24:07,078
Just might
fool somebody

400
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,680
in a hurry to
get to Gregg.
Right.

401
00:24:08,715 --> 00:24:10,615
Yah!

402
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,591
We ain't noonin' yet.

403
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:21,593
We're crossing
a stream.

404
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:25,597
We'll have to
stop in a bit.

405
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:28,600
We'll do it right
this time.

406
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:30,602
None of you make
a move until I say.

407
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:33,605
I thought we'd agreed that
you had failed as a leader.

408
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,607
And you figure you're
right for the job?

409
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,609
Well, let's take a vote.

410
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:39,110
Norm,

411
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,111
what do you say?

412
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,113
Lennie or me?

413
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:44,115
Well, I-I don't know.

414
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,116
You've got to vote.

415
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:46,618
There's a saying
that anybody

416
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:49,120
who interferes in another man's
business ends up on a spit.

417
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:52,624
You sure don't live
by the sayings of
where you come from.

418
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:55,126
YeahWell, that's why I left.

419
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,629
Now, this boy's got
trouble enough.

420
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,130
Why don't you
let him be.

421
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:00,131
Well, how about you?

422
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:04,135
I'll follow anybody
who can show me an exit.

423
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:05,637
Uh-huh.

424
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,639
Virgo's with me.

425
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:10,108
How do you know?
I hold his proxy.

426
00:25:10,143 --> 00:25:13,612
I vote for myself-
that makes two votes.

427
00:25:13,647 --> 00:25:15,113
Who'd follow you?

428
00:25:15,148 --> 00:25:17,115
A man who murdered
his own wife?

429
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,621
That was an act of mercy.

430
00:25:22,656 --> 00:25:26,625
She was ill; she lingered on.

431
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,128
I was the perfect husband
all that time, when...

432
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:32,631
until I found out
that behind my back

433
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:36,635
she'd given all her money
to her mother and her sister.

434
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,389
So I had to kill them, too.

435
00:25:44,893 --> 00:25:47,395
It's easy, the way I do it.

436
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:51,399
Quiet... and leaves no mess.

437
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:53,902
You ain't fit for
decent company.

438
00:25:58,907 --> 00:26:00,408
You know, Lennie,

439
00:26:00,443 --> 00:26:02,410
you remind me of my wife.

440
00:26:02,445 --> 00:26:03,912
Lingering on.

441
00:26:03,947 --> 00:26:06,698
You're ill,
an incompetent, a fool.

442
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:12,203
All right, you
two, cut it out!

443
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,706
Come on! Lennie!

444
00:26:21,731 --> 00:26:24,699
Let's see what's
going on back there!

445
00:26:24,734 --> 00:26:26,701
I'll cover you.

446
00:26:37,212 --> 00:26:40,198
Dallas, you can
ride topside.

447
00:26:51,626 --> 00:26:53,628
They fighting over you?

448
00:26:53,663 --> 00:26:55,630
What difference
does it make?

449
00:27:17,652 --> 00:27:21,139
Thanks for changing
the marshal's bandage.

450
00:27:21,174 --> 00:27:25,644
That lawman can't stand
much more of this jogging.

451
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,647
Guess you're not as hard
as you think you are, Dallas.

452
00:27:28,682 --> 00:27:32,150
Understand me, trail boss,
I'm glad that man is dying,

453
00:27:32,185 --> 00:27:34,653
because you're gonna
have to stop this wagon

454
00:27:34,688 --> 00:27:37,155
if you want him to live.

455
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,659
We'll stop as soon as we find
a place protected to noon.

456
00:27:40,694 --> 00:27:43,662
Only protection
is to free me.

457
00:27:43,697 --> 00:27:45,163
Why do you want to die

458
00:27:45,198 --> 00:27:47,666
because of a lot of folks
you don't even know?

459
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:50,168
Nobody wants to die.

460
00:27:50,203 --> 00:27:52,170
A man just does
what he feels is right.

461
00:27:52,205 --> 00:27:55,173
When you're looking down
the barrel of Luke's gun,

462
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:56,675
you'll change your mind.

463
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:57,676
Maybe.

464
00:27:57,711 --> 00:28:00,178
I hope not, but maybe.

465
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:22,751
Hey, Luke!

466
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:30,759
Yeah.

467
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:34,262
Whoever it is,

468
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:37,265
they're smart enough
to know the shortcut.

469
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,768
It cost us over an hour.

470
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:42,270
They're still on the way
to Fort Gregg.

471
00:28:54,282 --> 00:28:55,784
Whoa!

472
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:09,297
Better check our back trail,

473
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:11,299
Rowdy.
All right.

474
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:14,185
You're only beginning
to get nervous.

475
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:17,172
You want to wrestle?

476
00:29:17,207 --> 00:29:19,174
We've still got two falls to go.

477
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:46,668
You can build a fire
over there.

478
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:49,854
If you make any smoke,
nobody eats.

479
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,833
Marshal, you all right?

480
00:30:01,868 --> 00:30:05,036
Yeah. The girl helped me.

481
00:30:05,071 --> 00:30:07,355
I've been thinking
of staying here overnight,

482
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,040
give that wound
a chance to heal.

483
00:30:09,075 --> 00:30:12,243
No. No, we-we've got
to get to Fort Gregg.

484
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:13,945
All right, we'll go on.

485
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,947
You want anything to eat?

486
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:19,551
Just a little water.

487
00:30:19,586 --> 00:30:21,553
Don't worry about me.

488
00:30:21,588 --> 00:30:23,555
Keep your eyes
on the prisoners.

489
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,024
Especially that
Englishman.

490
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:27,625
I don't trust him.

491
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:39,137
Nothing behind us
but space.

492
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,285
All right,
let's move on.

493
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:59,040
And douse that fire
real good.

494
00:31:17,225 --> 00:31:19,227
Rowdy! Get that fire!

495
00:31:29,904 --> 00:31:32,190
Throw some
dirt on it!

496
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,436
Stay where you are!

497
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,040
Get back in the wagon,
all of you.

498
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:51,542
You heard him. Move.

499
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:54,045
What are you doing this for?

500
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,548
You want to be
alive when your husband
catches up, don't you?

501
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,553
Come on up here.

502
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,555
Come on up and rescue us.

503
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,058
While you're doing that,
that redneck up there's
gonna strangle Luke's wife.

504
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:09,360
Even if you shoot us,
he'll still kill her.

505
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:11,396
What's one woman
more or less to him?

506
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:13,314
Go on with your
prison wagon.

507
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:14,816
We're waiting for Luke.

508
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:16,317
Aren't we?

509
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:17,819
One shot from you,
and she goes.

510
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:19,570
And you shoot,
one of us goes.

511
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,172
What's that get you?

512
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:22,373
Two of us gone.

513
00:32:22,408 --> 00:32:24,609
The rest of us bang your heads
to pieces with these!

514
00:32:24,644 --> 00:32:26,861
Hold them, Rowdy.
All right, get in.

515
00:32:26,896 --> 00:32:29,864
Hey, where's the boy?

516
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,452
Go on, get in.

517
00:32:34,487 --> 00:32:36,955
Get in the back. Come on.

518
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,879
He ain't gonna kill her,
Mr. Favor!

519
00:32:44,914 --> 00:32:47,382
He ain't gonna kill nobody!

520
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:56,274
Are you hurt, Dallas?

521
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:57,775
What do you want me to say?

522
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,277
Don't want you
to say nothing.

523
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:01,779
You all right, Norm?
Yes, sir.

524
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:04,782
All right, get back
down to the wagon.

525
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,786
Let's go, Sinclair.

526
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,294
Come on.

527
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,312
Yah!

528
00:33:34,347 --> 00:33:36,314
Giddap!

529
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,791
Both of them out.

530
00:34:03,826 --> 00:34:05,793
Not me.

531
00:34:05,828 --> 00:34:07,795
Well, you might
as well be.

532
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,297
Do you think I failed?

533
00:34:09,332 --> 00:34:10,798
Do you think
Dallas failed?

534
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:12,300
You failed the
biggest of us all.

535
00:34:12,335 --> 00:34:15,303
No, no, because I found out
something very important.

536
00:34:15,338 --> 00:34:16,804
Eh, what are you saying?

537
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:18,306
I nearly pulled it off,
didn't I?

538
00:34:18,341 --> 00:34:19,807
If you'd kept this boy
from interfering,

539
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,809
I'd have succeeded.

540
00:34:21,844 --> 00:34:22,810
All right, you tell me,

541
00:34:22,845 --> 00:34:24,312
what did you find
out by failing?

542
00:34:24,347 --> 00:34:26,314
Oh, I don't expect you
to understand this.

543
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:28,316
Never mind what
you don't expect
me to understand!

544
00:34:28,351 --> 00:34:30,318
And we've got a...
traitor in our midst,

545
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:31,819
a dirty, lousy traitor

546
00:34:31,854 --> 00:34:33,821
who shouldn't be allowed
to hear me.

547
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,323
I'm not a traitor,
Mr. Sinclair.

548
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:37,825
I want to get out of this
as much as anybody,

549
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,328
but you did wrong
trying to kill that girl.

550
00:34:40,363 --> 00:34:42,330
You did wrong,
and I stopped you.

551
00:34:42,365 --> 00:34:44,832
Very fine, very noble.

552
00:34:44,867 --> 00:34:46,834
Now, you didn't
answer me, redneck.

553
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:49,337
Now, what did you find out
by failing to spring us?

554
00:34:49,372 --> 00:34:50,838
A matter of strategy.

555
00:34:50,873 --> 00:34:52,457
I found out
it's not what you do

556
00:34:52,492 --> 00:34:53,891
but where you do it.

557
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:54,892
What do you mean?

558
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:57,395
There's a water crossing
between here and Fort Gregg.

559
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,680
The trail boss
will have his hands full

560
00:34:59,715 --> 00:35:01,182
crossing the water.

561
00:35:01,217 --> 00:35:03,684
That's where.

562
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:05,686
You understand me?

563
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:07,688
That's where.

564
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,730
Yah!

565
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,843
I'd never sit next
to you if you did
what I did.

566
00:36:01,878 --> 00:36:03,845
You do things for what
you think is right.

567
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,346
Got to admire you
for that.

568
00:36:05,381 --> 00:36:06,347
It's just
too bad that...

569
00:36:06,382 --> 00:36:07,849
Look, I don't need
your pity.

570
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:09,851
Too bad that what you
think is right isn't.

571
00:36:09,886 --> 00:36:11,352
'Cause I hate the law?

572
00:36:11,387 --> 00:36:12,854
The law made
one mistake.

573
00:36:12,889 --> 00:36:14,355
Why throw your life away?

574
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:16,357
All that talk.

575
00:36:16,392 --> 00:36:18,359
Just watch out,
that's all I got to say.

576
00:36:18,394 --> 00:36:19,861
Just watch out.

577
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,746
This is the place.

578
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:57,148
There's riders behind us.

579
00:36:57,183 --> 00:36:58,149
How many?

580
00:36:58,184 --> 00:36:59,650
Four, and they're
coming fast.

581
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:00,651
How far?

582
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:02,353
About a mile.

583
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:05,856
Well, if we can get
across that river

584
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:06,857
we got a chance.

585
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:07,858
And up that hill.

586
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:09,360
It can't be
too far to Gregg.

587
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:10,861
You know, I could hold
them off pretty good

588
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,330
from that ridge
right over there.

589
00:37:12,365 --> 00:37:14,115
There's plenty of places
to hold them off

590
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,116
once we're across.

591
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:16,617
I don't think that wagon's

592
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:18,586
going to make it
across that stream.

593
00:37:18,621 --> 00:37:19,587
We'll have to try.

594
00:37:19,622 --> 00:37:21,088
Haven't got time
to look for a ford.

595
00:37:21,123 --> 00:37:23,591
Look, we'll unhitch
the team, take them across.

596
00:37:23,626 --> 00:37:25,843
There's a block
and fall up front there.

597
00:37:25,878 --> 00:37:27,845
You anchor it
to that big tree,

598
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,048
and we'll use the team
to haul the wagon across.

599
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,350
Think we got
enough rope?

600
00:37:32,385 --> 00:37:33,851
There's plenty
up there.

601
00:37:33,886 --> 00:37:35,853
They probably got it
for times like these.

602
00:37:35,888 --> 00:37:37,355
All right.

603
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,357
Move over, Dallas.

604
00:37:39,392 --> 00:37:42,360
Why don't you leave me
here on this side of the river?

605
00:37:42,395 --> 00:37:44,362
Luke won't follow you.

606
00:37:44,397 --> 00:37:46,747
Can't do that.

607
00:37:46,782 --> 00:37:48,249
You're a fool.

608
00:37:48,284 --> 00:37:51,252
You may be right
about that.

609
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,220
You better take
this gun, Mr. Favor.

610
00:38:09,255 --> 00:38:10,471
Right.

611
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:24,695
You going to cross
that water?

612
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,047
That's right.

613
00:39:26,082 --> 00:39:28,933
You can't mean to cross
it with us inside this wagon.

614
00:39:28,968 --> 00:39:30,751
Supposing it sinks?
I plan to let you out.

615
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:33,270
Some of us can't swim.

616
00:39:33,305 --> 00:39:35,973
You can raft across
on top of the wagon.

617
00:39:52,106 --> 00:39:54,408
Come on, let's go.

618
00:39:57,912 --> 00:39:59,413
Look here...

619
00:39:59,448 --> 00:40:01,916
With these on, we'd be
just as trapped up there

620
00:40:01,951 --> 00:40:03,300
as we would be in the wagon.

621
00:40:03,335 --> 00:40:04,502
If anything should happen,

622
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,904
drowning isn't
the most pleasant death.

623
00:40:06,939 --> 00:40:09,340
Sure wouldn't want
to see anybody die
unpleasantly.

624
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:10,841
Now you three
get the marshal

625
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:12,343
and get ready to put
him up on top.

626
00:40:12,378 --> 00:40:13,644
You two climb up front,

627
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,012
get up there
and give him a hand.

628
00:40:15,047 --> 00:40:16,514
Come on, let's go.
With these on?

629
00:40:16,549 --> 00:40:18,015
Let's go.

630
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,019
Climb.

631
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,025
Here's your water
crossing, redneck.

632
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,026
What do we do now?

633
00:40:29,061 --> 00:40:30,327
Wait till he
starts across.

634
00:40:30,362 --> 00:40:33,063
When we get to the middle
of the stream we'll jump him.

635
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,068
Get ready up there.

636
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,557
All together now.

637
00:40:59,592 --> 00:41:01,058
Let's go.

638
00:41:10,017 --> 00:41:12,019
The rest of you
get up on top.

639
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,215
Holy smokes.

640
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,217
I don't like this.

641
00:42:00,252 --> 00:42:01,819
Neither do I.

642
00:42:01,854 --> 00:42:04,038
Hang on, Dallas.

643
00:42:04,073 --> 00:42:07,041
Hang on tight,
all of you.

644
00:42:08,042 --> 00:42:09,543
Ready.

645
00:42:09,578 --> 00:42:12,129
Come on,
come on.

646
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:56,540
Tell us when, Luke.

647
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:58,542
When they get
to the middle.

648
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:00,544
When they're up
to their necks.

649
00:43:21,115 --> 00:43:24,068
Rowdy, pull up
that slack!

650
00:43:24,103 --> 00:43:26,103
I am.

651
00:43:26,138 --> 00:43:27,304
Get up.

652
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:28,505
Come on, come on.

653
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:18,589
Help! Help!

654
00:44:18,624 --> 00:44:20,374
Help!

655
00:44:21,675 --> 00:44:24,178
Help!

656
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:54,575
All right,
bring her in here.

657
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,889
You better
get us in.

658
00:45:08,924 --> 00:45:09,890
Lennie's hurt.

659
00:45:09,925 --> 00:45:10,891
Shut up, redneck.

660
00:45:10,926 --> 00:45:12,309
I'm all right, Luke.

661
00:45:12,344 --> 00:45:14,094
Tell them to shut up, Jed.

662
00:45:15,095 --> 00:45:17,598
She's coming around.

663
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:22,019
Honey?

664
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:24,021
Luke.

665
00:45:24,056 --> 00:45:25,739
Yeah, honey, it's me.

666
00:45:25,774 --> 00:45:27,241
Oh, Luke.

667
00:45:27,276 --> 00:45:28,742
Come on.

668
00:45:32,746 --> 00:45:33,747
She all right?

669
00:45:33,782 --> 00:45:34,748
Yeah, she's all right.

670
00:45:34,783 --> 00:45:35,749
Shut up.

671
00:45:41,188 --> 00:45:42,623
Well, cow head...

672
00:45:42,658 --> 00:45:45,476
looks like I win
the last fall.

673
00:45:45,511 --> 00:45:47,077
Yeah.

674
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:50,047
Let's get out
of here, Luke.

675
00:45:50,082 --> 00:45:51,248
Sure, honey.

676
00:45:51,283 --> 00:45:53,650
We got to take care
of a few lawmen.

677
00:45:53,685 --> 00:45:55,385
Not that it makes
any difference,

678
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,703
but we're not
lawmen.

679
00:45:56,738 --> 00:45:58,789
You sure acted
like it.

680
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:01,191
You deserve
whatever you get.

681
00:46:01,226 --> 00:46:02,793
See, mister, me
and my wife,

682
00:46:02,828 --> 00:46:04,795
we're not over-fond
of the law.

683
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:06,447
We respect it.

684
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,467
Respect it so much,
we try very hard
not to get caught.

685
00:46:10,502 --> 00:46:12,069
That's being
more sensible
than you were

686
00:46:12,104 --> 00:46:14,471
when you took
over that prison
wagon, ain't it?

687
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:18,342
Well, maybe you've
learned your lesson now.

688
00:46:18,377 --> 00:46:20,844
Maybe next time you won't
interfere in something

689
00:46:20,879 --> 00:46:22,446
that's none of your business.

690
00:46:22,481 --> 00:46:24,047
Hey, Jed.

691
00:46:24,082 --> 00:46:25,849
You got charges
in that rifle
for each of them?

692
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:26,850
Yeah, you bet.

693
00:46:26,885 --> 00:46:28,652
Then what are you
waiting for?

694
00:46:28,687 --> 00:46:29,653
Shoot 'em down.

695
00:46:29,688 --> 00:46:30,654
No.

696
00:46:30,689 --> 00:46:33,157
If you're going
to shoot somebody, see?

697
00:46:34,441 --> 00:46:35,943
Who did that?

698
00:46:35,978 --> 00:46:38,445
The Englishman.

699
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,947
One of those?

700
00:46:39,982 --> 00:46:42,449
Yeah.

701
00:46:45,953 --> 00:46:47,454
You all right, Lennie?

702
00:46:47,489 --> 00:46:48,956
I'm all right, Luke.

703
00:46:48,991 --> 00:46:50,958
Which one's
the Englishman?

704
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,962
I am.

705
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:07,391
See how it's done?

706
00:47:07,426 --> 00:47:08,392
How easy it is?

707
00:47:08,427 --> 00:47:10,394
See how easy
it is for you?

708
00:47:10,429 --> 00:47:11,395
Leave 'em be, Luke.

709
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:13,897
Like he told you,
they're not lawmen.

710
00:47:13,932 --> 00:47:15,899
Now, honey, I can't
leave 'em be.

711
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:20,337
Now, let me see...

712
00:47:20,372 --> 00:47:23,207
Dallas honey, you're up
on that Bible stuff.

713
00:47:23,242 --> 00:47:27,127
I want to do for him
what he has done...

714
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,980
An eye for an eye...

715
00:47:30,015 --> 00:47:31,582
a tooth for a tooth.

716
00:47:31,617 --> 00:47:33,333
That's it.

717
00:47:33,368 --> 00:47:36,420
And eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth.

718
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:41,225
No, on second thought,

719
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,527
I think I'll take care
of this myself.

720
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:51,935
Now you stand aside, woman.

721
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:54,404
I want to remove
temptation from your eyes

722
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:55,639
like the preacher says.

723
00:47:55,674 --> 00:47:58,275
I told you, Luke,
they're not lawmen.

724
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:00,277
All the more reason
to blame them

725
00:48:00,312 --> 00:48:01,778
for taking on
this chore.

726
00:48:01,813 --> 00:48:03,664
They didn't mean
nothing. Let 'em go.

727
00:48:03,699 --> 00:48:05,165
What are you talking about?

728
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,667
You want them
to wander into town

729
00:48:06,702 --> 00:48:08,118
and set the wolves on us?

730
00:48:08,153 --> 00:48:09,870
They won't, Luke,
I swear they won't.

731
00:48:09,905 --> 00:48:11,688
You...

732
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:15,359
You swear for them?

733
00:48:15,394 --> 00:48:17,361
Have they taken
you over?

734
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:19,096
Listen, Luke...

735
00:48:19,131 --> 00:48:22,099
You-you saw him
save my life.

736
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:26,103
Stand aside, Dallas.

737
00:48:26,138 --> 00:48:28,105
Luke, there's no need
to kill him.

738
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:32,109
Are you for him
or are you for me?

739
00:48:32,144 --> 00:48:34,611
Will you stand aside?!

740
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:39,700
You try it and I'll shoot,
so help me.

741
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:43,704
Now, tell you what, honey...

742
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:45,889
you put up that gun
and we'll go on from here,

743
00:48:45,924 --> 00:48:47,958
and pretend like you never
made this play.

744
00:48:47,993 --> 00:48:51,161
Just as soon as I see them
safely on their way.

745
00:48:51,196 --> 00:48:53,163
I was the one taught you
how to use that gun.

746
00:48:53,198 --> 00:48:54,798
You taught me a lot of things.

747
00:48:54,833 --> 00:48:56,400
Maybe some of them wrong.

748
00:48:56,435 --> 00:48:57,601
Watch out, Dallas.

749
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,940
You don't think I'd shoot
my own wife, do you, mister?

750
00:49:21,842 --> 00:49:25,362
What happens now,
Mr. Favor?

751
00:49:25,397 --> 00:49:28,598
I mean... what happens
to me?

752
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:30,600
I don't know,
Dallas.

753
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:33,003
Sure you do.

754
00:49:33,038 --> 00:49:35,405
You're going to take me
to Fort Gregg.

755
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,407
I'd be...

756
00:49:37,442 --> 00:49:40,610
I'd be disappointed if you
went against yourself now.

757
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:42,612
Only...

758
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:46,216
take it real slow on the trail.

759
00:49:46,251 --> 00:49:48,218
I don't want to die in prison.

760
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:27,257
?Rollin', rollin', rollin',
rollin', rollin', rollin'?

761
00:50:27,292 --> 00:50:29,760
Keep rollin',
rollin', rollin'?

762
00:50:29,795 --> 00:50:31,261
Though the streams
are swollen?

763
00:50:31,296 --> 00:50:33,764
Keep them dogies rollin'?

764
00:50:33,799 --> 00:50:36,266
Rawhide?

765
00:50:36,301 --> 00:50:38,769
Through rain
and wind and weather?

766
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:41,505
Hell-bent for leather?

767
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:45,726
Wishin' my gal
was by my side?

768
00:50:45,761 --> 00:50:48,228
All the things
I'm missin'?

769
00:50:48,263 --> 00:50:50,230
Good vittles,
love and kissin'?

770
00:50:50,731 --> 00:50:54,735
Are waiting
at the end of my ride?

771
00:50:55,235 --> 00:50:57,537
Move 'em on, head 'em up,
head 'em up, move 'em on?

772
00:50:57,572 --> 00:51:00,040
Move 'em on,
head 'em up, rawhide?

773
00:51:00,075 --> 00:51:02,042
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in,
ride 'em in, let 'em out?

774
00:51:02,077 --> 00:51:04,044
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in?

775
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:07,547
Rawhide...?
?Rollin', rollin', rollin'?

776
00:51:07,582 --> 00:51:09,049
?Rollin', rollin', rollin'...?

777
00:51:09,084 --> 00:51:10,050
Hyah!

778
00:51:11,586 --> 00:51:14,054
Hyah!

779
00:51:14,089 --> 00:51:19,059
?Rollin', rollin', rollin',
rollin', rollin', rollin'?

780
00:51:19,094 --> 00:51:20,560
Hyah!
?Rollin', rollin', rollin'...?

781
00:51:22,097 --> 00:51:26,066
