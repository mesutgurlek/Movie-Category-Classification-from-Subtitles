Haven't the people who
love you suffered enough?

You said they can't attack the house!

5
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,870

You need to be smart, discreet. Especially

21
00:01:08,449 --> 00:01:12,139
- when you're hunting demons.
- Revenants. Wyatt Earp's kills;

00:01:12,175 --> 00:01:14,233
- Daddy called them revenants.
- Are you sure

23
00:01:14,268 --> 00:01:16,052
this is one of 'em?

24
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:21,682
Yeah.

- Woops! Sorry.

Fancy but powerless.

30
00:01:36,152 --> 00:01:38,532
Pretty sure only Peacemaker
can send revheads back to Hades.

31
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:41,664
- You don't know that for a fact.
- Wanna bet? Loser buys dinner?

32
00:01:41,699 --> 00:01:45,261
No. You lose, you die. OK? Besides,

33
00:01:45,296 --> 00:01:46,674
- I don't gamble.
- You're sending in

34
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:49,343
- your best agent...
- My only agent.

...with the wrong gun that....

36
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:54,094

- Good luck.

37
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:57,084
- You're not coming?
- Consider this your first solo mission.

38
00:01:57,213 --> 00:01:58,215
Don't blow it.

39
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,387
I never blow jobs without a please first.

- Great, we lost him.
- Well, you lost him!

64

Black Badge is about
flying under the radar;

65
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:44,825
you flew over the radar
in a flaming, pink jet.

66
00:03:44,877 --> 00:03:46,751
You made a spectacle of yourself, Deputy.

67
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:47,839
- Pink?
- Yeah, pink!

68
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:52,800
How dare you! And you owe me dinner.

69
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,413

70
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,576

Wyatt's revenants seem to be concentrated

106
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,692
here in Purgatory, so this
will be our battleground.

- Not enough.

Ah.

124
00:07:02,628 --> 00:07:04,909
Well now, they're gonna
have to deal with you.

125

Right after you deal with
the shit ton of paperwork

you generated after last
night's disastrous takedown.

127
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:13,167
OK. Like, one blonde broke a heel,

128
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,837
and I was trying to smoke the revenant.

129

Aaah!

130
00:07:19,425 --> 00:07:21,243
Our number 1 priority is to keep the public

131
00:07:21,278 --> 00:07:24,019
- from learning they exist.
- People here deserve to know

132
00:07:24,054 --> 00:07:26,356
what they're up against,
even if most of these people

133
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:27,933
- are dicks who hate me.
- If the public know

134
00:07:27,968 --> 00:07:31,839
that demons are out
there... widespread panic.

135
00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:33,937
OK. Have a little faith.

136
00:07:33,973 --> 00:07:38,192
We've survived hotdog-stuff crust
pizzas, so I think we got this.

137
00:07:39,094 --> 00:07:40,837
- What is that?
- Maldito, New Mexico.

138
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:43,949
The last town to realize they
were under siege from hellspawn.

139
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,035
- It's a crater.
- That's all that was left

140
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:51,155
after they dispatched
the Tomahawk missiles.

141

- To beat the bad guys?
- To contain the story.

Alright, Mr.
Know-it-all,

149
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,263
tell me what my sister sees in that d-bag?

150
00:08:16,315 --> 00:08:18,867
I couldn't tell you; I
don't do relationships.

151
00:08:18,938 --> 00:08:21,935
How about smiling? You ever do that? Hmm?

See, but it wasn't the
whore's burgundy corset

154
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:38,965
that gave me pause, gentlemen,
nor was it the healthy merkin

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,400
perched between that sweet
dove's legs. No, it was

156
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:45,759
that she had a tail.

157
00:08:45,994 --> 00:08:48,390
An honest-to-goodness
tail

158
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,182

172

better you and yours

- It is just a matter

185
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:15,966

186
00:10:16,018 --> 00:10:17,870

187
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:21,571

great-great-granddaddy.

188

190

Dude, I didn't even tequila.

or personal cheque or certified cheque

318
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:57,032
or... stop me if I'm
repeating myself... cash.

319
00:16:57,067 --> 00:16:59,031
We do not take pirate booty

320
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:01,225
- or whatever these are.
- OK.

321
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,177
Don't worry, Shorty, I got this.

322
00:17:03,307 --> 00:17:04,601
I know him.

323
00:17:04,711 --> 00:17:07,649
I keep telling her, you don't
have to be nice to everybody.

324
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:09,504
Oh, I appreciate the sentiment,

325
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:11,768
but I'm not sure I do know you.

326
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:14,771
And I would remember a face like yours.

327
00:17:14,856 --> 00:17:17,040
(laughing): OK. Hi.

328
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:18,942
I'm Waverly. And don't do that,

329
00:17:19,062 --> 00:17:20,548
I have a big, burly
boyfriend who can bring a calf

330
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,940
- to its knees in 8 seconds flat.
- Oh, my!

331
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,916
He sounds positively harrowing.

332
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:29,089
- I know what you're here for.
- Really?

333
00:17:29,124 --> 00:17:32,402
Yeah. I can spot you groupies a mile away.

334
00:17:32,437 --> 00:17:35,725
You know, the fake Old West
getup, the awe-struck reverence

335
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,663
while you gaze upon his saddlebags...

336
00:17:38,698 --> 00:17:42,046
I m... I mean I totally get it,
right? You wanna keep his memory alive.

337
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:44,851
You wanna drink where Wyatt Earp

338
00:17:44,887 --> 00:17:46,770
- drank!
- Wyatt didn't drink;

339
00:17:46,805 --> 00:17:50,128
- he preferred ice cream.
- Uh, well, who doesn't,

340
00:17:50,163 --> 00:17:52,985
right? I'm an Earp.

341
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,860
I-I m... I mean... I mean, "Earper."

342
00:17:55,895 --> 00:17:58,760
I'm an "Earper" too. Yeah.

343
00:17:58,795 --> 00:18:00,899
Found most of this stuff myself.

344
00:18:00,934 --> 00:18:03,865
Don't you try to go up
against me on eBay now.

345
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,750
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.

346
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,755
You know, I've got Wyatt's
original holster up in my apartment.

347
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,830
- Yeah.
- ♪ I was down to the ground ♪

348
00:18:13,978 --> 00:18:16,383
Oh, which I am definitely not
inviting you up to by the way.

349
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:18,385
You are so not my type.

350
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,509
Darlin', I'm everybody's type.

351
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,472
So you sleep here too?

352
00:18:22,508 --> 00:18:24,468
It's a shame a pretty
thing like you never gets

353
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:28,375
- to leave the saloon.
- You know what?

354
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,731
There.

355
00:18:30,954 --> 00:18:32,560
Covered you out of my tips.

356
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:35,339
- I did not ask you to.
- No.

357
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,126
Didn't need to.

358
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,585
I got a good feeling about you.

359
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:43,196
And I'm an excellent judge of character.

360
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,165
Sweetheart...

361
00:18:48,383 --> 00:18:50,655
- you really aren't.
- ♪ Break it up, break it up ♪♪

362
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,790
Only Peacemaker puts 'em down for good.

363
00:18:52,825 --> 00:18:54,838
Long as I hit 'em between the eyes.

364
00:18:54,873 --> 00:18:56,814
Oh! And revenants can't physically hold it.

365
00:18:56,849 --> 00:19:01,511
Not without vibrating
faster than a... You know.

366
00:19:01,676 --> 00:19:04,681
I have my toys; you have yours. Anyway.

367
00:19:04,764 --> 00:19:07,247
Regular guns can slow the
revheads down, but they will

368
00:19:07,282 --> 00:19:08,315
always come back for more

369
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,129
until they meet Peacemaker,
which only I can handle...

370
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:13,461
- (gun clattering on floor)
- Yep, in theory.

371
00:19:13,496 --> 00:19:15,450
Look. I've been attacked

372
00:19:15,485 --> 00:19:17,944
four times in the last three days, OK?

373
00:19:17,979 --> 00:19:20,314
The homestead, Shorty's, I'm a...

374
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:23,130
I need a safe place to regroup and sleep.

375
00:19:23,187 --> 00:19:26,903
- As long as you don't leave town.
- (knocking twice on door)

376
00:19:27,072 --> 00:19:28,818
Hey! Check it out:

377
00:19:28,904 --> 00:19:35,069
another piping hot delivery
from... Wow, "CSIS."

378
00:19:35,104 --> 00:19:36,833
Oh, I'm Nicole.

379
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:38,592
Officer Haught. Y'all getting settled in

380
00:19:38,627 --> 00:19:40,611
- alright? What is all this stuff?
- Nice to meet you,

381
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:44,580
Officer Haught. If you
ever enter my offices again

382
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:48,174
without knocking, I'm gonna
have you arrested for treason.

383
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,476
OK?

384
00:19:49,612 --> 00:19:51,662
Nice to meet you too.

385
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:59,113
She did knock, Dolls. You sure
you didn't want to threaten her

386
00:19:59,148 --> 00:20:01,772
- with death?
- Penalty for treason is death.

387
00:20:01,824 --> 00:20:03,753
It was implied.

388
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:07,055
I know.

389
00:20:09,264 --> 00:20:10,681
Red tried to get ahold

390
00:20:10,716 --> 00:20:14,312
of Peacemaker; it fried
him from the inside out!

391
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:17,123
Then-then Earp picked
it up and-and-and Red...

392
00:20:17,158 --> 00:20:19,756
Caught a one-way ticket down south, right?

393
00:20:19,977 --> 00:20:21,956
Let me see if I got this straight.

394
00:20:22,034 --> 00:20:24,344
Malcolm kills her uncle,

395
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,307
lures the heir back home, and now this?

396
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:29,110
How many times do I got to tell you idiots?

397
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:30,721
Peacemaker can't be
touched by revenant hand.

398
00:20:30,768 --> 00:20:33,501
- But-but we-we just thought...
- Don't!

399
00:20:33,652 --> 00:20:36,306
Ever! Think!

400
00:20:37,138 --> 00:20:40,310
I do the thinking... for all of us.

401
00:20:40,312 --> 00:20:41,941
You hear me?

402
00:20:41,976 --> 00:20:43,770
Now, you wanna get out of here, Levi?

403
00:20:43,805 --> 00:20:46,693
You wanna escape the
Triangle, feast on everything

404
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:48,880
- and everyone?
- Hell, yes.

405
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,571
Boss, it's all I want!

406
00:20:50,606 --> 00:20:52,304
It's good.

407
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:56,138
So what we do... is we
create a distraction...

408
00:20:56,532 --> 00:20:58,328
we bring in professional help.

409
00:20:58,408 --> 00:21:01,498
If we wanna hire him...

410
00:21:01,687 --> 00:21:03,800
we need a mortal's blood,

411
00:21:03,836 --> 00:21:05,583
willingly given.

412
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,734
None of our human familiars will risk it!

413
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:09,728
So we need a sucker.

414
00:21:11,306 --> 00:21:12,829
OK.

415
00:21:12,864 --> 00:21:15,345
Why, I just happen to have one...

416
00:21:15,397 --> 00:21:18,014
and he's mighty keen to impress me.

417
00:21:21,318 --> 00:21:26,629
Now, what does one get for the
demonic sociopath that has everything?

418
00:21:27,576 --> 00:21:30,675
A braver man would suggest mouthwash.

419
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,602
But hello...

420
00:21:41,613 --> 00:21:43,256
(chuckle)

421
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:47,544
"Lonny Riggs, Henry Starr, Cole Younger"

422
00:21:47,616 --> 00:21:50,269
She's got the who's who of outlaws in here.

423
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,721
- Lord Almighty!
- (door opening)

424
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:02,339
Whoever you are, you're
robbing my sister's place,

425
00:22:02,374 --> 00:22:04,895
and that's a bad move, revenant.

426
00:22:05,522 --> 00:22:07,188
Son of a bitch!

427
00:22:11,108 --> 00:22:12,508
Crap!

428
00:22:15,324 --> 00:22:16,989
So he was fast.

429
00:22:18,176 --> 00:22:21,789
♪♪♪

430
00:22:21,824 --> 00:22:23,387
I love what you've done with the place.

431
00:22:23,422 --> 00:22:25,077
Another rendezvous so soon?

432
00:22:25,183 --> 00:22:28,371
I suppose I should be flattered.

433
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:31,003
Now, did you bring me
something of the Earps?

434
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,211
- I'm working on it.
- 'Cause you're gonna enlist

435
00:22:35,246 --> 00:22:38,413
someone who's gonna take care of the heir.

436
00:22:38,448 --> 00:22:40,856
And once she's dead, you're
gonna bring me her gun.

437
00:22:40,891 --> 00:22:44,018
Unless you got a problem with that?

438
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:48,404
The only one about to
have a problem is Wynonna.

439
00:22:48,723 --> 00:22:52,569
Now, what exactly does this entail?

440
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:54,221
(scoffing)

441
00:22:54,536 --> 00:22:58,420
What is this revenant's raison d'être?

442
00:22:58,455 --> 00:23:01,718
- Do I know him?
- His name's Jim Miller.

443
00:23:01,796 --> 00:23:04,089
Killed his grand-parents,

444
00:23:04,124 --> 00:23:06,867
brother-in-law, then
anyone he was paid to.

445
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:08,682
Called him Killer Miller.

446
00:23:08,783 --> 00:23:10,624
I remember.

447
00:23:10,671 --> 00:23:13,470
Rumor has it was Miller, not Robert Ford,

448
00:23:13,523 --> 00:23:15,364
who put down Jesse James.

449
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:19,575
Well, Robert Ford was an awful shot.

450
00:23:19,622 --> 00:23:23,230
It was always said,
Miller moved like a shadow.

451
00:23:23,344 --> 00:23:25,258
Now he is one.

452
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,082
Shadow assassin

453
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,821
who can only be activated
via blood sacrifice.

454
00:23:30,932 --> 00:23:35,242
You outlaws sure have gotten
dramatic since you were human.

455
00:23:35,365 --> 00:23:39,298
The Shadow's as far from human as it gets.

456
00:23:39,423 --> 00:23:41,582
You know, the real question is:

457
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:45,261
- what the hell are you?
- Still me. Don't be jealous.

458
00:23:45,354 --> 00:23:47,501
Not jealous. I'm disgusted.

459
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,871
You were Wyatt Earp's right hand;

460
00:23:49,964 --> 00:23:52,003
what would he say if he
knew you were joining forces

461
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:54,372
with every man he ever put down?

462
00:23:54,407 --> 00:23:56,513
The dead don't get a vote.

463
00:23:56,575 --> 00:23:59,679
Now, are we doing this or what?

464
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:03,162
Hey, I got all 34 of your texts.

465
00:24:03,197 --> 00:24:05,184
Your apartment's been broken
into; you can't go back.

466
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:06,531
Oh, what?!

467
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:08,802
- But my yoga mat is there!
- Well, it's not safe,

468
00:24:08,837 --> 00:24:10,907
and neither is Gus' or Shorty's

469
00:24:10,942 --> 00:24:13,614
or the back of Champ's pickup.

470
00:24:13,729 --> 00:24:15,549
Ewww!

471
00:24:15,807 --> 00:24:18,259
This place used to be.

472
00:24:18,565 --> 00:24:20,393
Remember when Mama made these windchimes?

473
00:24:20,428 --> 00:24:23,220
Do you remember? This was a home then.

474
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:25,260
You know? Never saw anything scarier

475
00:24:25,295 --> 00:24:27,315
than an albino gopher.

476
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,014
Until the attack where half of us died.

477
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,530
Oh, hey, Marshal Dolls!

478
00:24:31,565 --> 00:24:34,139
How old were you when the
revenants invaded the homestead?

479
00:24:34,174 --> 00:24:35,687
- 12.
- 6.

480
00:24:35,722 --> 00:24:38,221
- And they'd never done it before?
- Maybe they were scared

481
00:24:38,256 --> 00:24:41,426
- of our dad.
- Or physically unable to step

482
00:24:41,461 --> 00:24:43,978
- foot on Earp land.
- What... Hey, that's...

483
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,869
Ammonite. This mineral found around here?

484
00:24:45,904 --> 00:24:47,909
I j... Unless you can smoke
it, I really wouldn't know.

485
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,765
You want a safe place?
This stuff might explain

486
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,299
why your ancestors built this house here.

487
00:24:52,334 --> 00:24:56,278
A house that doesn't have running
water and smells like skunk hiney?

488
00:24:56,852 --> 00:24:59,669
Yeah, I'll... I'll be in my car.

489
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:05,503
It's tough for her... being the youngest?

490
00:25:05,577 --> 00:25:09,010
Yeah. She was 4 when Mama left.

491
00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:12,405
- She just up and moved away.
- Maybe it runs in the family.

492
00:25:13,315 --> 00:25:15,878
Anyways, you got a good look
at the thief at Waverly's?

493
00:25:15,913 --> 00:25:17,895
- Better yet, a shot?
- (scoffs)

494
00:25:18,021 --> 00:25:20,152
Yeah, I did, but he was better.

495
00:25:20,231 --> 00:25:22,850
Better than what?

496
00:25:23,163 --> 00:25:25,582
You two look around the homestead.

497
00:25:25,629 --> 00:25:27,579
See if you see anything unfamiliar,

498
00:25:27,662 --> 00:25:29,882
something occult-ish.

499
00:25:29,976 --> 00:25:31,093
(scoffs)

500
00:25:31,192 --> 00:25:33,489
Occult...? That is so specifically vague.

501
00:25:33,524 --> 00:25:37,698
You want a safe place to lay
your head for you and your sister?

502
00:25:37,751 --> 00:25:40,580
- Keep your eyes open, Earp.
- For trouble?

503
00:25:40,951 --> 00:25:42,591
That too.

504
00:25:53,383 --> 00:25:57,115
You really think Jim Miller
can dispatch the heir?

505
00:25:57,448 --> 00:26:00,345
I've seen Ms. Earp at work up close.

506
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,723
She is quick. And tough too.

507
00:26:02,775 --> 00:26:04,384
She might surprise you.

508
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:07,394
Yeah. The Shadow's real
particular on payment:

509
00:26:07,446 --> 00:26:09,030
mortal blood.

510
00:26:09,162 --> 00:26:12,080
You say you're still human...

511
00:26:15,805 --> 00:26:17,535
Hold this.

512
00:26:18,647 --> 00:26:21,517
Looks like it's my turn to befoul...

513
00:26:23,141 --> 00:26:25,642
...someone else's abode.

514
00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:34,341
(wind howling)

515
00:26:34,376 --> 00:26:37,315
(deep, growling voice): What is the target?

516
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:40,903
No! I can't! I won't go back in the dark!

517
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:43,315
Give Miller his orders! Toss in something

518
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,538
of the heir so he knows
who the real target is!

519
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,759
You could not have acquainted me
with those particulars earlier?

520
00:26:48,828 --> 00:26:51,745
I have nothing on my person
that belongs to Wynonna Earp!

521
00:26:58,527 --> 00:27:01,027
(Shadow growling)

522
00:27:05,895 --> 00:27:08,696
(deep voice): She will be mine.

523
00:27:10,342 --> 00:27:12,426
What...

524
00:27:12,461 --> 00:27:14,709
- was that?
- He who moves amongst

525
00:27:14,744 --> 00:27:18,047
the shadows and delivers us the darkness.

526
00:27:18,141 --> 00:27:20,467
The bitch heir will never survive.

527
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,830
Lord knows her daddy didn't.

528
00:27:23,463 --> 00:27:25,918
Except that wasn't.

529
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:29,575
I tossed Miller something that
belonged to Wynonna's sister.

530
00:27:30,393 --> 00:27:33,947
His mark is Waverly.

531
00:27:34,046 --> 00:27:36,455
That sweet little thing?

532
00:27:36,997 --> 00:27:39,573
You must really hate the Earps.

533
00:27:45,101 --> 00:27:47,758
OK, so what exactly are we looking for?

534
00:27:47,855 --> 00:27:50,370
Something strange and hard to explain.

535
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:52,281
Like your relationship with Champ.

536
00:27:52,316 --> 00:27:55,402
Pfft! You're hardly qualified
to give relationship advice.

537
00:27:55,454 --> 00:27:58,539
Remember that guy with
the satanic-face tattoo?

538
00:27:58,632 --> 00:28:01,163
What? Phil really loved
Norwegian death metal.

539
00:28:01,198 --> 00:28:03,994
- Oh, sure.
- Look, Waverly...

540
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,817
Hohohoho!

541
00:28:05,864 --> 00:28:08,194
Willa, age 10...

542
00:28:08,517 --> 00:28:11,572
Wynonna, age 7. Hmm...

543
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:13,539
I'm not on there, am I?

544
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,756
Probably rubbed off.

545
00:28:15,935 --> 00:28:17,758
Yeah.

546
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,760
It's what I used to tell myself.

547
00:28:20,097 --> 00:28:22,931
(generator powering down)

548
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:30,284
(cell phone ringing)

549
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:35,006
- Yeah?
- <i>It's not ammonite, </i>

550
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,995
- it's ammolite.
- Pfft! Amateur mistake.

551
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,176
<i>Prized by the Blackfoot for
its ability to ward off evil.</i>

552
00:28:40,211 --> 00:28:42,449
Which it probably did when
you guys were growing up.

553
00:28:42,484 --> 00:28:43,652
So I looked at the survey,

554
00:28:43,687 --> 00:28:46,287
and the homestead's built
on a bedrock of the stuff.

555
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:47,725
Whoa, Dolls, slow down.

556
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,922
<i>Remember that occult
something I told you to find?</i>

557
00:28:49,957 --> 00:28:51,455
It's a talisman made

558
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,844
from vertebrae and bound by iron twine.

559
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,210
<i>Ew! We haven't found
anything like that.</i>

560
00:28:56,245 --> 00:28:59,430
It'll be in the ground. Buried
to counteract the ammolite.

561
00:28:59,465 --> 00:29:00,995
Dolls, the homestead is 10 acres;

562
00:29:01,088 --> 00:29:03,333
we can't dig for it all ni...

563
00:29:03,411 --> 00:29:09,109
Night... seems to have fallen awful early.

564
00:29:09,556 --> 00:29:10,802
- It's dark out there?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

565
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,679
The sky's gone all weird.
Same at the cop shop?

566
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,690
<i>No.</i>

567
00:29:14,768 --> 00:29:16,949
Eclipse? Storm?

568
00:29:16,984 --> 00:29:19,486
- Revenant?
- Just stay near a light source.

569
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,488
- Why? What's coming?
- <i>Me.</i>

570
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,158
I'm 30 minutes out. I'll be there, Earp.

571
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:25,993
- (Beep!)
- (sigh)

572
00:29:26,566 --> 00:29:30,164
God! I swear, I can't
get this flashlight lit!

573
00:29:30,297 --> 00:29:33,667
Hey, what do you say to a
good, old-fashioned cookout?

574
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:37,022
God! How can it be dark already?

575
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,256
It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

576
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:40,897
It's Purgatory. Wait 20 minutes,

577
00:29:40,932 --> 00:29:43,004
we'll be slathering on the sunscreen.

578
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,887
So what did Dolls say again
about the talisman being...

579
00:29:45,922 --> 00:29:49,850
- Buried in the ground.
- Buried...

580
00:29:50,594 --> 00:29:53,182
(man): The witching hour.
Perfect time to make a hole

581
00:29:53,217 --> 00:29:55,164
- for our friend Waverly.
- Will this really

582
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:57,306
- make them happy?
- (man): This will guarantee

583
00:29:57,341 --> 00:29:59,576
you all get what you deserve.

584
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:05,282
Bobo. The name of my imaginary
friend when I was growing up: Bobo!

585
00:30:05,468 --> 00:30:09,870
And I'm starting to think
that he wasn't so imaginary.

586
00:30:09,872 --> 00:30:12,539
- (wind howling)
- Ohhh...

587
00:30:12,682 --> 00:30:15,709
God, that's super weird. What's going on?

588
00:30:16,763 --> 00:30:18,679
The yard light's out.

589
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:20,901
- I'll check the generator.
- What?!

590
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,579
What... Wynonna, what's going on?!

591
00:30:22,672 --> 00:30:24,468
Nothing. Just go inside.

592
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,743
Waverly, go!

593
00:30:30,643 --> 00:30:32,726
(growling)

594
00:30:32,778 --> 00:30:35,145
(generator humming)

595
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,120
(deep, growling voice):
Your hair smells like lilies.

596
00:30:43,763 --> 00:30:46,373
The flower of funerals.

597
00:30:46,713 --> 00:30:48,713
Worst pickup line ever.

598
00:30:53,249 --> 00:30:55,416
(unsettling music)

599
00:30:55,418 --> 00:30:58,302
(Wynonna panting)

600
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:01,755
(footsteps)

601
00:31:08,507 --> 00:31:10,431
DIE!

602
00:31:11,448 --> 00:31:12,600
OK.

603
00:31:12,717 --> 00:31:14,099
Creepy giant revenant alert!

604
00:31:14,162 --> 00:31:16,040
Moves through shadows, sucks in light,

605
00:31:16,095 --> 00:31:18,939
whispers things very high
on the disturb-o-meter.

606
00:31:18,991 --> 00:31:20,637
- You need to hide.
- What?! No! No way!

607
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:22,481
Just until I get Peacemaker back.

608
00:31:22,528 --> 00:31:25,055
- You "lost Peacemaker?!
- Just get in

609
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,147
a closet, under the bed, anywhere
the darkness can't find you.

610
00:31:28,182 --> 00:31:31,448
Those are the dark places! And
hiding didn't help me last time!

611
00:31:31,483 --> 00:31:35,289
- (girl screaming)
- (revenant laughing)

612
00:31:37,718 --> 00:31:39,793
(girl screaming)

613
00:31:40,492 --> 00:31:42,435
Shadowman is one of the revenants

614
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:45,275
- that took Daddy and Willa.
- Oh, God.

615
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:48,163
If that shit ticket
thinks he's coming in here

616
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:50,071
uninvited again...

617
00:31:50,133 --> 00:31:54,003
OK. Oh, I love when you say "shit ticket."

618
00:32:03,202 --> 00:32:05,903
OK, where is this thing?

619
00:32:09,825 --> 00:32:13,460
- What?
- Waverly, behind you!

620
00:32:13,496 --> 00:32:16,895
(Waverly screaming)

621
00:32:16,942 --> 00:32:20,334
- Oh, my God!
- (Waverly panting)

622
00:32:20,336 --> 00:32:22,327
- OK. Oh, shit.
- Oh, God!

623
00:32:22,362 --> 00:32:25,418
- Q-q-q-quick! Quick, OK?
- (engine troubles)

624
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:27,671
- Come on, you stupid junker!
- Hello.

625
00:32:27,706 --> 00:32:29,800
Oh, God! I think he is
draining the battery!

626
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:33,347
- Run! I'll hold him off.
- No! No way! This is Earp land,

627
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:35,304
- our land!
- We can't hold off revenants

628
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:37,012
from it. Not until we find the talisman...

629
00:32:37,047 --> 00:32:40,002
I know because I'm the one who buried it.

630
00:32:41,256 --> 00:32:44,635
Well, good idea, but we'll
never cross the fence line.

631
00:32:44,746 --> 00:32:48,226
- He probably couldn't!
