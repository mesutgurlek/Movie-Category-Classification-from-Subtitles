1
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,383
What tribe are you with?

2
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,789
Where are they from?

3
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:17,535
Where are you from?

4
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,110
- Could be up from Mexico.
- Where are the rest of their men?

5
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,976
Odds are about a day's ride ahead,
looking for food and a place to hide.

6
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,317
I'd put one of them on a horse,
and have him tell the tribe...

7
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:33,944
...they'll have to come to San Carlos
if they wanna see these people again.

8
00:04:34,123 --> 00:04:36,990
- Sergeant Rudabaugh, I wanna move out.
- Yes, sir.

9
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,357
You heard the man.
Thompson, bring those horses up here.

10
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,261
Collins, get these people lined up.
Men together, women and children together.

11
00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:45,458
Let's move it.

12
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:47,603
- Foothills by sundown, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

13
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,135
Mister.

14
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,228
For the love of God.

15
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:26,165
Who are you?

16
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,941
What's your name?

17
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:32,138
Do you have a name?

18
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:38,113
Nick. Nick, come on up here.

19
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:42,687
Get her name. Some kind of name.

20
00:05:53,636 --> 00:05:55,661
You can talk to me.

21
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,433
Do you speak English?

22
00:06:02,178 --> 00:06:04,043
What is your name?

23
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:06,940
Sarah.

24
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,482
Sarah, that's fine. Your name is Sarah.

25
00:06:09,652 --> 00:06:13,144
- Carver.
- Sarah Carver.

26
00:06:13,322 --> 00:06:14,880
When were you captured?

27
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:18,293
Long...

28
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,888
...time.

29
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,397
Were there any survivors?

30
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:32,503
All dead.

31
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:34,299
It's over now.

32
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:37,109
Do you understand?

33
00:06:37,513 --> 00:06:40,676
It's all over now. Come along.

34
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,453
Buck, bring that horse up here. Hurry.

35
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:10,043
Let's go. Come along.
- Carver party.

36
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:15,079
Outside Lemmington.
About 10 years ago.

37
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,116
They found a man, a woman
and three young boys.

38
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:24,184
I wonder what she went through
all those years.

39
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:27,489
All right, everybody, move out.

40
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:45,536
You sure picked a hell of a way
to end 15 years with the Army.

41
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,244
- I don't mind getting out alive.
- Ha-ha.

42
00:07:55,658 --> 00:07:57,649
Ho!

43
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,584
Sergeant Rudabaugh, you take over.

44
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:26,946
Forward.

45
00:09:16,872 --> 00:09:18,362
- Apaches?
- Yeah.

46
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,532
- How many?
- Just one.

47
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,837
But there were three men.
They were all armed.

48
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,906
One set of tracks and a buffalo rifle.

49
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,879
Salvaje.

50
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,047
I thought he was in Mexico.

51
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:36,248
He was here.
Not more than a few hours ago.

52
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:40,388
Last I heard of Salvaje,
he was clear down to Window Rock.

53
00:09:40,563 --> 00:09:42,030
What the hell is he doing here?

54
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:44,826
He took on 10 troopers down there,
killed four of them...

55
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,992
...and not a one of them
got a look at him.

56
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:50,104
Let's bury those people and get moving.

57
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:53,367
Sergeant Rudabaugh, form a burial detail.

58
00:09:56,112 --> 00:10:00,572
Collins, Foster, burial detail.
- What the hell is going on?

59
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,516
What's happening?
- Salvaje, that's what. Move.

60
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,796
Hello, Collie.

61
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:57,731
Look after him.
I'm pulling out in the morning.

62
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:06,247
Open up. Clear the way.

63
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:22,330
We must go now.

64
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,932
I must go.

65
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,305
My dear woman,
just be thankful you're alive.

66
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:34,172
We cannot stay here.

67
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,158
Of course she'll go.
She's not staying here.

68
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:55,923
- You won't be staying here.
- She wants to go now.

69
00:11:56,098 --> 00:11:57,395
Today?

70
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:59,830
Yes. Please.

71
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:02,294
I can't give you an escort today.

72
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,495
Sam.

73
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:07,474
And if I could, where would you go?
Do you have a place to go?

74
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,076
Where do you come from?

75
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:10,644
Columbus.

76
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,441
Would you still have people there?

77
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,217
Yes.

78
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:19,650
Well, either way,
there's no sense in going today.

79
00:12:20,256 --> 00:12:23,316
You and your boy should rest now,
get some food in you.

80
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,789
You're wasting your time.

81
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,655
What do you mean, wasting my time?

82
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,525
She insisted upon seeing you
because she wants to leave...

83
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:32,633
...not because she wants to be fed.
We've been all through that.

84
00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:34,394
Well, she's not leaving.

85
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,971
I'm sorry, I can't give you an escort
out of here for another five days.

86
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,337
If I could,
I'd have you on your way right now.

87
00:12:41,977 --> 00:12:47,938
The only person who'll be leaving here
is Mr. Varner, in the morning.

88
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,014
And if I can,
I'll keep Mr. Varner from leaving too.

89
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,713
Now, you go on back to your tent.

90
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,950
We'll give you an escort to Silverton
by the end of the week.

91
00:12:58,127 --> 00:13:01,927
You can contact government agencies.
They'll take good care of you.

92
00:13:02,097 --> 00:13:05,464
Toomey, escort this lady and the boy
back to the tent.

93
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:07,158
Yes, sir.

94
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,735
God only knows what's going on
in that poor woman's mind.

95
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:18,941
Going.

96
00:13:19,114 --> 00:13:20,775
Where is she gonna go?

97
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:26,354
You're not gonna know how to live
out there any more than that woman will.

98
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:29,290
Well, what the hell
is so important out there anyway?

99
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,916
After 15 years.
One more year, that's all I ask.

100
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:37,498
- That's all you asked last year.
- That's all I'll ask next year.

101
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:41,027
- I'm short of good men. I need you, Sam.
- You've got Nick.

102
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:42,500
No. Nick's a breed.

103
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:44,536
- He's good.
- He's a breed, Sam.

104
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:48,666
If he wants to move on, he'll move on.
He's here because you took him in.

105
00:13:48,844 --> 00:13:52,109
If he cares about anything,
it's not about this Army.

106
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:55,273
Not this year, major.
I got a place to go to...

107
00:13:55,451 --> 00:13:56,941
...and I'm going.

108
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,110
Thank you for the whiskey.

109
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,993
A place to go to.

110
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,200
Thought you was leaving.
- Sunrise. You seen Nick?

111
00:14:20,376 --> 00:14:23,174
- Not here. Buy you a whiskey?
- Oh, no, thanks.

112
00:14:25,014 --> 00:14:27,539
Your breed ain't too happy
about you leaving, you know?

113
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:30,644
Well, he'll get used to it.

114
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:32,719
It's time he was on his own.

115
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:37,185
Ante up.

116
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:39,519
Two bucks.

117
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:41,860
Deal.

118
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:51,369
I'll try to win you a little money.

119
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,812
- I figure I'll buy you cow for your farm.
- Ranch.

120
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,245
Yeah, ranch.

121
00:15:05,554 --> 00:15:07,419
There goes your cow.

122
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:12,888
Come on. I'll buy you a drink.

123
00:15:15,898 --> 00:15:17,559
Come on.

124
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:19,496
I got a drink.

125
00:15:29,411 --> 00:15:32,778
Maybe someday I show up,
you teach me grow onions, huh?

126
00:15:33,882 --> 00:15:36,350
You wanna grow onions,
you know where to find me.

127
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:51,589
You teach me everything so good, huh?

128
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:05,678
I do it again, I gotta draw blood, huh?

129
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:08,842
It'd be a big waste of 10 years,
wouldn't it?

130
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:20,117
Mister.

131
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:28,193
Yes, ma'am?

132
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,304
You're going to Silverton?

133
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:36,010
No, ma'am, I'm not going to Silverton.

134
00:16:36,178 --> 00:16:38,146
You can take us.

135
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:42,645
- I'm not going to Silverton, ma'am.
- The major said.

136
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:45,985
Oh, well, he said
I was leaving in the morning...

137
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:47,986
...but I'm not going to Silverton.

138
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:50,022
We have to go.

139
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:58,623
Well, you'll get an escort
to Silverton in five days.

140
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:01,898
Too late.

141
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:06,000
Well, I'm sorry, ma'am.

142
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:08,169
Please.

143
00:17:08,844 --> 00:17:11,335
I'm going to New Mexico.

144
00:17:11,513 --> 00:17:13,947
I don't go by way of Silverton.

145
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,850
The Army will take good care of you.

146
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:19,419
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

147
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,985
Good night, ma'am.

148
00:17:25,427 --> 00:17:27,054
Please.

149
00:18:33,595 --> 00:18:35,119
Please.

150
00:18:56,185 --> 00:19:00,121
Tell the major that the lady and her boy
will be needing a transportation voucher.

151
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:18,839
I'll take you to Hennessey, ma'am. You can
get the stage for Silverton from there.

152
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:20,838
That's as far as I'll take you.

153
00:20:31,613 --> 00:20:33,012
Silverton stage?

154
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,415
Day after tomorrow.

155
00:20:40,055 --> 00:20:41,886
We can use some rest.

156
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:45,451
Julio.

157
00:22:30,198 --> 00:22:34,191
Heh. Well, we're going
to Silverton together?

158
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:36,667
Those of us who's going.

159
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:40,036
I sent my family back to Wichita.
That's where I'm heading.

160
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:49,715
You know, this man in Hopperville...

161
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:52,547
...has real strong hope for this territory.

162
00:22:52,721 --> 00:22:54,245
Why, just the other day, he says:

163
00:22:54,423 --> 00:22:57,790
"Lee, now, if you wait it through,
you can bring your family back.

164
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:06,198
Sooner or later, we're gonna run
all the Indians out," he says.

165
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:25,796
He took my knife.

166
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,796
He tried to kill me.

167
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:08,663
What's the trouble?

168
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:27,350
My boy. He's gone.

169
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,257
Bring out my horse.

170
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:17,706
Never seen...

171
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,581
...nothing...

172
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,320
...like him.

173
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,665
Salvaje.

174
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,617
He'll come back.

175
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,953
- Not here.
- We should go now. He'll come.

176
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,890
We're not going anywhere.

177
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,462
He's finished here.
He did what he came to do.

178
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,425
He is not finished.

179
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,531
He came for his son.

180
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:37,181
He'll come back for his son.

181
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:53,899
You pulled us out here knowing all the time
he'd come after us?

182
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:58,804
I thought he would not get to us in time.

183
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,906
Five days.

184
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:07,518
You couldn't wait for five days?

185
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:13,718
You could've had an Army escort
in five days.

186
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,759
Is that worth five days?

187
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:25,366
He will come back.

188
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:29,666
- We cannot stop.
- Well, we've stopped.

189
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,400
Whoa.

190
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,473
Where's your Mex? What's going on?

191
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:06,569
He's dead.

192
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:09,713
They're all dead. Salvaje.

193
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,945
Nobody leave the wagon.
We're moving out.

194
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,945
These people are going to Silverton.

195
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,022
- Government travel papers.
- All right, all right, put them on.

196
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,954
Hurry it up.

197
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:32,166
Just show this to the stationmaster
at Silverton.

198
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:39,869
You riding with us, mister?

199
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:42,774
I'd sure feel better
if somebody was riding behind us.

200
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:44,915
I'd appreciate it.

201
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,745
Hyah! Giddyup.

202
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,057
Whoa.

203
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:16,104
Changing horses. Fifteen minutes.

204
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,760
Thank you.
- Much obliged.

205
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,144
Depot.

206
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:58,305
Train comes in over there.

207
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,812
Come on, we'll get your tickets.

208
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,638
Columbus?

209
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:35,415
You said you wanted to go to Columbus.

210
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,215
I don't know.

211
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:45,385
Well, you said you had family
in Columbus.

212
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:51,862
My family is dead.

213
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:59,603
Well, there must be somebody left there.

214
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,745
Friends, somebody.

215
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:08,611
All right.

216
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,844
Columbus.

217
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,649
I'm afraid this won't take them
to Columbus.

218
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:16,323
This voucher can't cross them
into Ohio on the Revel Line.

219
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:19,793
And there'd be a change in Kansas City
to the Revel Line.

220
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,864
Get them to Topeka.

221
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:26,863
Well...

222
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:30,166
What about Topeka?
You wanna go to Topeka?

223
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:35,010
It's far. It's in Kansas.

224
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:39,672
All right.

225
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,346
Topeka.

226
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:48,791
Two?

227
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:51,359
The lady and the boy.

228
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:56,828
Train should be here sometime
about 2 or 3.

229
00:38:57,268 --> 00:39:00,431
It'll take them as far as Taspola.

230
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:04,040
They'll have to change there
and wait on for a train to Gallup.

231
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:07,041
It shouldn't be more than a few hours.

232
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:11,841
Then they can ride this ticket
through to Dodge City.

233
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,278
God willing.

234
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:16,318
Then just wait till Tuesday...

235
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:18,785
...and then they can just take
the V.D.R. and O...

236
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:21,481
...right on through to Topeka.

237
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:38,268
Could you get along
without that shoebox?

238
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,557
Well, I figure I can travel some
before sunset.

239
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,897
Much good luck.

240
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,171
Thank you.

241
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:27,582
He buried them.
He can tell you more than I can.

242
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:31,125
All right, Ollie, get that team ready
and get the passengers on.

243
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:34,423
- We're moving out.
- Ready to go, Shelby.

244
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:36,093
You buried them, huh?

245
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:41,067
We're all out of beer, all out of ice.

246
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:44,605
We've got some coffee and there's cereal
left on the stove if you want.

247
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,242
Coffee.

248
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:48,636
Ready to go, Shelby.

249
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,552
Giddyup. Yeehaw.

250
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:11,792
A hell of a way to live, driving a stage.

251
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,550
Can you cook?

252
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:14,823
Well, I got a parcel of land
in New Mexico.

253
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:18,060
I bought it through the mail.
I've only seen it once.

254
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:20,169
I've been sending money down there...

255
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:23,704
...to an old man who's supposed to be
buying cattle for me.

256
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:29,177
It's not much of a house,
but it's a place to live in.

257
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:31,246
The old man and me
would get more work done...

258
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:34,043
...if we had somebody to cook for us.

259
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:37,378
It might be better for the boy
than the city.

260
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:40,515
You might not like it.

261
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,457
I've never lived with anybody in my life.

262
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:46,187
But I've agreed with myself...

263
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:48,888
...that you're welcome to come
if you wanna.

264
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:04,109
I have to sell my horse.

265
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:10,837
There's a pump around the side.

266
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:17,846
Come on.

267
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:16,664
I hear you had a bad winter.

268
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,171
- We lose many cattle?
- It was a bad winter.

269
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:22,710
Near killed them all last winter.

270
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:25,443
Come on, boy.

271
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,106
Come on.

272
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,939
Now, I know that we agreed...

273
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:15,380
...that you'd come down here
and do the cooking, and I appreciate it...

274
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:19,079
...but I can't say I'm real happy
about the way you stand around the room.

275
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:23,215
Now, come on, sit down at the table.
Both of you. Come on, come on.

276
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,428
With food on your plates.

277
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:54,016
Now, from now on,
we'll be taking our meals together.

278
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:56,751
I've got nothing against talking.

279
00:49:57,694 --> 00:50:00,322
I don't mind a little talking
now and then.

280
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:06,434
If anybody feels like saying anything, well,
just ought to say it. You know, anything.

281
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,672
"Pass the peas, pass the meat."

282
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,901
Just whatever you wanna say,
you just speak up. Speak up.

283
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:18,377
"Pass the meat, give me the salt."

284
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:21,545
Tell that to the boy.

285
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:25,753
Go on. Tell him if he wants some peas,
he ought to say, "Pass the peas."

286
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:28,591
Let's get this thing settled.

287
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:38,766
Huh.

288
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:06,291
What's the boy's name?

289
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:12,792
He wasn't given his name yet.

290
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:17,934
Well, let's give him one now.

291
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:21,139
What would you like to call him?

292
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:28,146
What was your father's name?

293
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:31,418
Thomas.

294
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,078
Good.

295
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,587
Good.

296
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:37,293
You wanna call him Thomas?

297
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:44,994
He wouldn't understand.

298
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:51,766
There is already too much...

299
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:54,642
...for him to understand.

300
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:36,780
You...

301
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:42,858
If anybody wants to say anything,
well, just go right ahead and say it.

302
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:45,885
"Pass the peas."

303
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:50,121
"Pass the salt."

304
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,836
Whatever you want passed.

305
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:09,741
It's...

306
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:15,323
It's not easy for me to talk.

307
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:21,830
It's been a long time...

308
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:25,098
...since I have talked.

309
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:31,934
But I would like to say this.

310
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:40,144
That it pleases me to be here...

311
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:48,825
...and I think it is a beautiful place to be.

312
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:19,551
Well, it's not much, but better than sand.

313
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:24,623
Plenty of blankets
and more firewood, just outside.

314
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:34,359
I want you to know that you're free here.
You can come and go as you please.

315
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,433
There's a view from that north ridge.

316
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:41,441
Sometimes I think you can see
all the way back to Arizona.

317
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:44,577
Good night, Miss Carver.

318
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,010
Good night.

319
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:01,135
Yeah, I think Sam Varner would
make you better scout by now, boy.

320
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:21,514
Ah, you son of a gun.
You picked me up, huh?

321
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:24,990
I spotted you from the ridge
about four miles back.

322
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:29,655
I'll tell you the truth, Varner, I figured I’d
find you dead over some onion patch, huh?

323
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:35,197
I listen at the fort.
I hear from the Indians about the boy.

324
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:38,340
- You know what he is, this boy?
- Yeah.

325
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:39,998
Oh.

326
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:43,976
Well, I figure maybe you don't know.
So I ride Hennessey.

327
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:46,843
I dig up that grave, Hennessey.
I figure maybe you're in it.

328
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:48,916
Goodbye, Sam, huh?

329
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:52,354
Then I ride Silverton.
Silverton, they're all dead too.

330
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,489
Even your horse dead, Silverton.

331
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,860
Then I hear he stops wagon at Oakley.

332
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:02,125
Two days later,
he's already Columbia Pass.

333
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,691
I figure out.

334
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:08,701
I come tell you. He's on his way.

335
01:00:13,576 --> 01:00:17,706
- I figured good, huh?
- Real good.

336
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:58,880
Nick will be here for a while.

337
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,823
Salvaje is on his way.

338
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:04,810
Have you told him anything?

339
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:11,153
I think...

340
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:14,288
...he already knows.

341
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:25,029
There's a Mexican family down the road.

342
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:28,502
I'll ride over in the morning. Warn them.

343
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:26,830
It has nothing to do with you.

344
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:39,044
It has to do with me.

345
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:43,685
I didn't have the courage to die.

346
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:51,220
I knew what I had to do to stay alive.

347
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:58,063
I chose to be with him.

348
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:13,408
Tomorrow I'm going
to take my boy away.

349
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:17,175
And Salvaje will find us...

350
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,581
...and maybe that will be enough for him.

351
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:23,452
It won't be.

352
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:29,024
It will keep him from here.

353
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,399
What about after here?

354
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:38,535
I buried his dead at Hennessey.

355
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:41,301
They're all dead at Silverton.

356
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:45,038
Dead all the way across Arizona.

357
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:49,176
I have to think about that.

358
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:51,983
If I can, I have to stop it.

359
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:58,817
You and the boy...

360
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:02,723
...aren't leaving here.

361
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:06,426
I want you to stay here.

362
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:18,079
It's right that you're here.

363
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,477
Hey, old man.

364
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:32,450
Wanna make a card game?

365
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,889
I teach you poker, huh?

366
01:06:40,896 --> 01:06:42,727
Eh.

367
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:45,025
He talk too much, doesn't he?

368
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:04,182
Hey, boy. Hey, come here.

369
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:20,028
Come here.

370
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:21,769
Come here.

371
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:34,944
If you gonna be white,
you better learn white man's game, huh?

372
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:37,716
Yeah.

373
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:42,617
Pretty good, huh? Sit down.

374
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:50,163
See this?

375
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:52,459
That's cards, huh?

376
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:55,532
See that? That's numbers.

377
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:59,363
Numbers. All numbers, huh?
Say this number. Four.

378
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:01,373
Four. That's four.

379
01:08:01,544 --> 01:08:02,568
Say that.

380
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:06,314
- Four.
- Four.

381
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:09,413
Say this one here.

382
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:11,682
Say that one. Three.

383
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:13,151
Three.

384
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:15,547
- Three.
- Three.

385
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:22,220
Hey, I teach you count, huh?
Okay, say ace.

386
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:23,762
- Ace.
- Ace.

387
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,457
Deuce.

388
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:27,295
- Deuce.
- Deuce.

389
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:28,869
Three.

390
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:32,166
- Three.
- Try again. Four. Four.

391
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:33,805
- Four.
- Four.

392
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:35,307
Five.

393
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:37,036
- Five.
- Attaboy.

394
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:39,841
You gonna make good poker player, eh.

395
01:08:41,016 --> 01:08:42,506
You want cigar?

396
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:45,449
You take cigar. Attaboy.

397
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:38,092
Where is she?
- We didn't see nobody.

398
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:42,567
- She's gone. The breed's looking.
- Get inside. Bolt the doors and windows.

399
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:14,732
Nick.

400
01:11:15,304 --> 01:11:16,532
I lose him.

401
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:18,195
Someplace I lose him. Damn it.

402
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:06,847
Tell the boy she's not dead.

403
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:09,410
Tomorrow morning.

404
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:45,937
You all right?

405
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:48,643
Yes.

406
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:59,586
We have to start before the sun's up.

407
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:57,143
He's doubled back.

408
01:19:02,204 --> 01:19:03,637
Open up.

409
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:32,292
I teach him poker.

410
01:20:36,731 --> 01:20:38,164
I teach him take your money.

411
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:43,062
How come you never give me
a chance to beat you, Varner?

412
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:45,206
Come on, I'll play you stud.

413
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:54,072
Maybe you make him tough scout, huh?

414
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:56,342
Maybe.

415
01:20:57,953 --> 01:20:59,887
Maybe this one
don't wanna be tough scout.

416
01:21:02,724 --> 01:21:03,748
Maybe not.

417
01:21:04,726 --> 01:21:07,286
You figure you beat the man,
you win the breed, huh?

418
01:21:08,663 --> 01:21:10,824
I'll tell you something, Varner.

419
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,034
Maybe the man beats you.

420
01:21:14,836 --> 01:21:17,361
Maybe this half-breed, he'll be Indian.

421
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:39,184
Feed my dog.

422
01:21:55,944 --> 01:21:58,378
Here, boy. Here.

423
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:16,587
Ned.

424
01:22:23,204 --> 01:22:24,501
Ned.

425
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:30,206
Ned.

426
01:22:30,378 --> 01:22:31,845
Ned.

427
01:23:20,862 --> 01:23:22,124
Ned.

428
01:23:23,765 --> 01:23:25,062
Ned.

429
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:14,944
I saw something.

430
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:20,983
You find the old man?

431
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:23,854
Yeah.

432
01:25:07,402 --> 01:25:09,336
You won't hear him.

433
01:25:10,972 --> 01:25:12,564
I'll hear him.

434
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:18,108
It doesn't happen that way.

435
01:25:23,751 --> 01:25:25,844
He just comes.

436
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:31,349
I'll hear him.

437
01:26:31,986 --> 01:26:33,510
I'm going to cross the clearing.

438
01:26:35,723 --> 01:26:40,683
Head for the north side of the corral
into the trees.

439
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:43,921
I'm gonna draw his fire.

440
01:26:45,633 --> 01:26:48,158
If I don't,
at least he'll be watching me.

441
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:53,334
When I get to the middle of the clearing,
I want you out the storeroom window.

442
01:26:55,443 --> 01:26:58,412
Our best bet's still having
two of us on him.

443
01:27:07,355 --> 01:27:09,255
Keep well behind me.

444
01:27:10,291 --> 01:27:12,691
If I can keep his eye on me...

445
01:27:14,862 --> 01:27:18,025
...he'll still think
there's one of us in this house.

446
01:27:25,607 --> 01:27:28,075
Let him know when I'm halfway across.

447
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:45,381
He's there.

448
01:30:33,761 --> 01:30:34,887
Sam!

449
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:17,557
Hey, Sam.

450
01:32:17,732 --> 01:32:19,097
Yeah?

451
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:33,395
He's hit.
