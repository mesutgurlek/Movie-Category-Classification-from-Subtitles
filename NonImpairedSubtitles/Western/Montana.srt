<i>where cattle was king.</i>

00:01:03,113 --> 00:01:04,876
<i>Where the law was a gun...</i>

3
00:01:05,048 --> 00:01:07,676
<i>... and the men who drove the great herds</i>
<i>up from texas...</i>

<i>... made the rules.</i>

5
00:01:09,552 --> 00:01:13,044
<i>They were hard men.</i>
<i>They had to be hard to keep alive.</i>

6
00:01:13,223 --> 00:01:16,556
<i>The ground they took with their guns,</i>
<i>they held with their guns.</i>

8

<i>Held it against cattle rustlers.</i>

9
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:26,931
<i>It was theirs by right of conquest.</i>
<i>They meant to keep it.</i>

10
00:01:27,403 --> 00:01:30,600
<i>Then came what they believed</i>
<i>was a new enemy.</i>

11
00:01:30,774 --> 00:01:33,038
<i>It came as a slow white tide...</i>

12
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:37,646
<i>... rolling north from the prairies</i>
<i>toward the grasslands of montana.</i>

<i>Sheep.</i>

14
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:43,382
<i>And with the sheep rode men</i>
<i>who also lived by their gun.</i>

15
00:01:43,553 --> 00:01:47,717
<i>They swept north slowly, steadily...</i>

16
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:52,988
<i>... searching for range, grass, water.</i>

17
00:01:53,563 --> 00:01:56,760
<i>Cattlemen claimed</i>
<i>there was death in this tide.</i>

18
00:01:56,933 --> 00:02:00,494
<i>They said no steer could live</i>
<i>where a sheep had grazed.</i>

19
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:03,097
<i>They warned the sheepmen to keep off.</i>

20
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,636
<i>Then they turned to their guns</i>
<i>and there was war.</i>

21
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:11,770
<i>They rolled back the first attack</i>
<i>and buried the sheepmen where they fell.</i>

22
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:15,080
<i>They buried some of their own too...</i>

23
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:17,981
<i>... and marked the spots for all to see.</i>

24
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:20,889
<i>They put up signs as a warning.</i>

25
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,491
<i>Signs that promised death</i>
<i>to any sheepman...</i>

26
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,426
<i>... who might look at this ground</i>
<i>and want it for his own.</i>

27
00:02:27,964 --> 00:02:31,559

Oh, it's sort of a friendly warning, mac.

32
00:03:03,867 --> 00:03:07,098
It says that any sheepman
crossing this point will get shot on sight.

- We're going across. What else can we do?

The sheep's all played out
and they need water.

36
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:18,480
- The nearest river is five miles ahead.
- The sheep can't go a step further this day.

37
00:03:18,648 --> 00:03:20,275
We'll have to bed down dry for the night.

i'd come back here one day...

...ever since the cattlemen
drove my father off the range.

43
00:03:32,228 --> 00:03:36,062
Australia, where your father took you,
is a fine, fine country for sheep, mr. Lane.

44
00:03:36,232 --> 00:03:39,759
It would have been far better to have
stayed there from the look of this.

Not me, mac. This time, i'm here to stay.
Well, cheer up.

at fort humboldt.

I'll be wetting my whistle tonight, mr. Lane,
if it's all the same to you.

- San francisco.

you've had that all that time?

the very thought of this kept me warm.

Laddie, there's barely enough
for the two of us.

Yup.

- Good.

No. I don't like them.

So am i. I wanna find out
what's wrong with sheep.

I think sheep are pretty important
in the world.

00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,031
I'd like to know
why a few cattle barons in montana...

off the open range.

None other than dr. Otto schwartz's...

- schultz. Schultz.
- Dr. Schultz's amazing "tiger-marrow fat."

Extracted from the wild beast
in its native lair.

179
00:14:09,665 --> 00:14:14,728
And, as the doctor will testify,
it cures every human ailment.

180
00:14:14,904 --> 00:14:16,997
It cures..."fallen arches"?

181
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,367
"Fallen arches, flat feet,
warts, corns, bunions.

And it also cleans and tightens

how to fan a gun, don't put it on.

00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,854
Maria and i are engaged to be married.

454
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,056
Oh.

455
00:32:32,233 --> 00:32:34,861
Is it too late to congratulate you?

456
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:38,904
Mr. Lane's not interested
in our personal affairs, rod.

457
00:32:39,073 --> 00:32:42,509
He's looking for some range land
for himself.

458
00:32:42,677 --> 00:32:45,168
Why don't we sell him
the bear creek range?

459
00:32:45,346 --> 00:32:46,404
We never use it.

460
00:32:46,581 --> 00:32:49,607
What makes you think mr. Lane
could run a cattle outfit?

461
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:52,976
Come right down to it,
what makes you think i couldn't?

462
00:32:55,256 --> 00:32:57,451
Running a cattle spread is a man's job.

463
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,490
- Rod.
- Oh.

464
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:01,595
You'll have to excuse rod, mr. Lane.

465
00:33:01,763 --> 00:33:06,063
- He's just had a bad time with a horse.
- Oh, sure, that's all right.

466
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:09,328
Matter of fact, i always did think
horses knew a lot about human nature.

467
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:11,131
What do you mean by that?

468
00:33:11,305 --> 00:33:15,105
Well, for instance, i think they know
who can handle them and who can't.

469
00:33:15,276 --> 00:33:19,303
Another very important factor is once you
get into the saddle, you gotta stay there.

470
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,142
- Evidently, you overlooked that.
- I suppose you could do better.

471
00:33:22,316 --> 00:33:25,342
Morgan: Well, i wouldn't say that.
I might try, though.

472
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,820
Especially if the stakes were right.

473
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:31,789
I wouldn't mind trying to ride anything
you've got for that bear creek range.

474
00:33:32,393 --> 00:33:36,523
If you mean that, mr. Lane,
you might just wind up with a broken neck.

475
00:33:36,698 --> 00:33:38,222
Morgan:
True enough.

476
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,493
On the other hand,
i might wind up with a range.

477
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:43,637
You wanna bet or don't you?

478
00:33:44,706 --> 00:33:45,866
It's a deal.

479
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,504

i'll throw my badge away.

the stranger stays up on him.

Will my partner stay on this horse?

What did you do, break your rope?

608
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,989
Morning, miss maria.

609
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:06,530
What are you men doing in town?

610
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,827
Ackroyd's orders, ma'am.

611
00:43:09,236 --> 00:43:10,965
That dog seems to like you, mister.

612
00:43:12,706 --> 00:43:16,039
Mm-hm. She should, i raised her.

613
00:43:16,977 --> 00:43:18,069
That's a sheepdog.

614
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,043
Yeah. Good dogs.

615
00:43:23,217 --> 00:43:24,616
You ought to get yourself one.

616
00:43:24,785 --> 00:43:27,117
Sheepdogs mean sheepherders
in this country.

617
00:43:27,288 --> 00:43:29,188
I thought i recognized you before.
Now i'm sure.

618
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,755
That dog of yours cinched it.

619
00:43:32,393 --> 00:43:35,624
Mister, you're a sheepherder.

620

621
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:43,767
Uh-huh.

622
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:46,829
He's right. I'm a sheepman.

623
00:43:50,644 --> 00:43:54,671
Now get back to those filthy sheep of yours
and get them out of the country.

624
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:58,510
No, ma'am. I'm staying right here.

625
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,883
I'm gonna move my sheep
into the pasture i just leased.

626
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:05,321
Wait a minute, mister.
You tricked me out of that lease.

627
00:44:05,492 --> 00:44:08,655
There's no law in this territory
that will hold me to it.

628
00:44:08,829 --> 00:44:10,797
Move your sheep
into that valley of mine...

629
00:44:10,964 --> 00:44:15,367
...and every cattleman in the country will
ride against you with every gun they've got.

630
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:35,450
Reeves: So miss singleton's dude friend
turned out to be a sheepherder, huh?

[Men laugh]

632
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,623
Listen, lane.

633
00:44:39,793 --> 00:44:42,261
You read that warning sign, didn't you?

634
00:44:43,364 --> 00:44:46,197
Yeah. Sure.

635
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:50,098
It said any sheepman
crossing the line gets shot on sight.

636
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,636
Well, why doesn't someone
start shooting?

637
00:44:54,508 --> 00:44:55,998
We don't shoot unarmed men.

638
00:44:56,176 --> 00:44:57,473
Maybe you figured on that.

639
00:44:57,644 --> 00:44:58,702
You're a liar.

640
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:02,142
Your men shot down my sheepherder...

641
00:45:02,316 --> 00:45:04,648
...a young kid
who never carried a gun in his life.

642
00:45:04,818 --> 00:45:08,754
Yeah. Any other sheepherder who crosses
that line will get the same as he got.

643
00:45:08,922 --> 00:45:10,219
He never crossed your deadline.

644
00:45:10,391 --> 00:45:12,188
Reese:
No, but you did.

645
00:45:13,494 --> 00:45:15,462
Listen, sheepherder.

646
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:20,289
Either you get out of town
or you'll get the same thing.

Drop that gun...

...or i'll squeeze this iron
as sure as you're born.

652
00:46:34,475 --> 00:46:37,603
You better get back to your sheep, mister,
while you're still alive.

[All laughing and jeering]

Here's some hot milk, dear,
to quiet your nerves.

655
00:47:21,649 --> 00:47:23,913
Hot milk? I'm so mad i could drink hot...

656
00:47:24,085 --> 00:47:26,315
milk will do. I'll set it right here.

657
00:47:26,487 --> 00:47:27,511
A sheepman.

658
00:47:27,688 --> 00:47:31,317
The lowest, vilest, most contemptible
creature on the face of the earth.

659
00:47:31,492 --> 00:47:34,461
If you could've seen him
standing there <i>smirking...</i>

660
00:47:34,629 --> 00:47:36,961
if i'd had a gun,
i'd have blown him in two.

661
00:47:37,131 --> 00:47:40,066
Next time you go out with him, dear,
be sure to carry your gun.

662
00:47:40,234 --> 00:47:43,431
Next time? Next time i gotta get even.

663
00:47:43,604 --> 00:47:45,128
Oh, what a fool i was.

664
00:47:45,306 --> 00:47:48,503
Every girl is entitled
to make a fool of herself once.

665
00:47:48,676 --> 00:47:52,112
Yeah, but not with a sheepman.

Well? If you can think of anything
more contemptible to say...

668
00:48:10,798 --> 00:48:14,256
...than i've already said to myself,
say it and get out.

669
00:48:14,836 --> 00:48:17,532
You must feel mighty proud
of the singleton name tonight.

670
00:48:17,705 --> 00:48:21,163
You've just handed the richest-watered
range land in the whole territory...

671
00:48:21,342 --> 00:48:23,537
...to a song-singing sheepman
in fancy clothes.

672
00:48:23,711 --> 00:48:25,235
Well, what if i did?

673
00:48:25,413 --> 00:48:27,540
It's my land.
I can do what i want with it.

674
00:48:27,715 --> 00:48:29,808
You idiot.
You played right into lane's hands.

675
00:48:29,984 --> 00:48:33,044
With that lease, he can move in.
He's got the law on his side now.

676
00:48:33,221 --> 00:48:36,384
Listen, if morgan lane
moves sheep on my land...

677
00:48:36,557 --> 00:48:39,082
...i'll personally shoot every one of them
and him too.

678
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:42,320
Oh, that's fine, brave talk
now that the damage has been done.

679
00:48:42,497 --> 00:48:45,159
Besides tossing away
everything our family's fought for...

680
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:48,791
...you've made a laughingstock out of me.
- You a laughingstock? Ha.

681
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:50,961
So that's what's hurting you, your pride.

682
00:48:51,138 --> 00:48:53,470
How do you think it looks
for the girl i'm to be marrying...?

683

If that's the way you feel,
you can call that off right now.

i got more important things to do.

687
00:49:03,651 --> 00:49:05,516
I'm gonna get that lease back.

Wait a minute.

689

and i'll get it back.

There's no more than a trickle of water
in the creek, laddie.

Yeah.

Hated to get it that way, though, mac...

...but it had to be.

Well, what about the sheep, mr. Lane?
They've got to have water.

We're driving them across tomorrow.

697

That means fighting and killing.

Yeah.

With their loud talk,
their riding and shooting...

and squeezed by the big outfits.

there's only one thing to be done.

on the same range with sheep.

on his sheep deal.

He's willing to cut us in on shares if we'll
back him up when he crosses the deadline.

00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,880
That sounds good
from a financial standpoint.

to start a fight they can't win.

of the big outfits will swing along with us...

00:52:58,352 --> 00:52:59,546
How about a cup of coffee?

761
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,915
Thanks, i will.

762
00:53:08,362 --> 00:53:10,796
With forsythe on our side,
i don't see how we can lose.

763
00:53:10,965 --> 00:53:13,160
- When did you see forsythe?
- I didn't.

764
00:53:13,334 --> 00:53:14,665
You don't know him?

765
00:53:15,336 --> 00:53:16,667
Uh-uh.

766
00:53:16,837 --> 00:53:19,032
Then how do you expect
to sell this deal to him?

767
00:53:19,206 --> 00:53:20,230
I don't know.

768

[Chuckles]

769
00:53:22,243 --> 00:53:25,644
First, you tell the little fellows
you've got forsythe on your side.

770
00:53:25,813 --> 00:53:29,340
Now you're going to tell forsythe
you've got the little fellows lined up.

771
00:53:29,517 --> 00:53:32,247
Lane, you ought to be a politician.

772
00:53:34,221 --> 00:53:37,657
Say, do you think it would be too late
to see forsythe tonight?

773
00:53:37,825 --> 00:53:38,985
Too late tonight?

774
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,991
Sure. You're gonna introduce me to him.

775
00:53:41,862 --> 00:53:43,329
Good health.

776
00:53:48,235 --> 00:53:50,567
Man:
All you gentlemen say is quite true.

777
00:53:51,005 --> 00:53:54,907
Everything you've told me is confirmed here
in my company's quarterly statement.

778
00:53:55,709 --> 00:54:00,510
We're facing an alarming situation
if the price of beef continues to decline.

779
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:04,616
Mr. Lane, i see your point.

780
00:54:04,785 --> 00:54:07,845
With sheep, we'd have two markets,
wool and mutton.

781
00:54:08,022 --> 00:54:10,320
The price of both is up.

782
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:13,349
Maybe you're right.

783
00:54:13,894 --> 00:54:16,294
There's just one hitch.

784
00:54:16,463 --> 00:54:18,954
You're asking me
to turn against my neighbors...

785
00:54:19,133 --> 00:54:22,193
...to make enemies of men
who've been my friends for years.

786
00:54:22,369 --> 00:54:25,270
Look, mr. Forsythe,
here it is in a nutshell.

787
00:54:25,439 --> 00:54:28,306
If you can convince your friends
of your faith in this plan...

788
00:54:28,475 --> 00:54:30,340
...you'll be accomplishing two things:

789
00:54:30,511 --> 00:54:32,479
You'll bring prosperity back to the range...

790
00:54:32,646 --> 00:54:35,274
...and you'll put an end
to all of this fighting and shooting...

791
00:54:35,449 --> 00:54:38,043
...that's been going on around here
for years.

792
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:40,880
It might work, gentlemen.

793
00:54:41,055 --> 00:54:42,420
It might work.

794
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:43,614
It will work.

795
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:46,521
Just get them together
and give it to them straight.

796
00:54:56,437 --> 00:55:00,100
And i want every wagon road and trail
that crosses our property closed.

797
00:55:00,274 --> 00:55:03,539
Cut some cedar posts and string new wire.
Have the men ride the line...

798
00:55:03,711 --> 00:55:06,771
...and check every foot of fence
between here and blackstone canyon.

799
00:55:06,947 --> 00:55:10,405
Reeves, i'm holding you responsible
for anything that gets through.

Yes, ma'am. All right, boys, let's go.

- Good morning, maria.
- Good morning, maria.

802

Maria: Morning.
- Things seem to be popping this morning.

803
00:55:23,831 --> 00:55:26,129
Maria:
They've just begun to pop, mr. Clark.

804
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,427
Say, what are you two doing
in my neighborhood?

805
00:55:28,602 --> 00:55:32,299
Well, george here insisted on driving over
to personally invite you and rod...

806
00:55:32,473 --> 00:55:34,407
...to a little gathering
at his house tonight.

807
00:55:34,575 --> 00:55:38,568
Well, i can't speak for rod,
but i'm in no mood for social affairs.

808
00:55:38,746 --> 00:55:40,646
It won't be altogether social, maria.

809
00:55:40,814 --> 00:55:42,441
There will be business discussed...

810
00:55:42,616 --> 00:55:45,141
...that concerns you
and every rancher in this section.

811
00:55:45,319 --> 00:55:47,651
- You make it sound mighty important.
- It could be, maria.

812
00:55:47,821 --> 00:55:48,845
Maria:
What's it all about?

813
00:55:49,023 --> 00:55:51,617
I can't very well tell you that
until we all get together.

814
00:55:51,792 --> 00:55:54,727
But it will be a sort of surprise.

815
00:55:54,895 --> 00:55:57,193
Well, i've had enough surprises lately.

816
00:55:57,364 --> 00:55:59,332
Thanks for the invitation.
Maybe next time.

817
00:56:04,138 --> 00:56:05,833
Maria:
Wait a minute.

818
00:56:06,573 --> 00:56:09,064
- I'll come to your party on one condition.
- Name it.

819
00:56:09,944 --> 00:56:11,707
Invite morgan lane.

820
00:56:13,514 --> 00:56:15,311
Morgan lane will be there, i promise.

821
00:56:25,793 --> 00:56:29,388
I'd like to know what's behind
forsythe's idea in giving this shindig.

822

Said he had a surprise for everybody.

823
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:33,461
Why don't you go in and find out?
You got an invite.

824
00:56:33,634 --> 00:56:36,432
Uh-uh. I got more important business
in town.

825
00:56:36,603 --> 00:56:38,798
You got more chance
of getting shot in town too.

826
00:56:38,973 --> 00:56:41,669
If that's your idea of humor,
keep it to yourself.

827
00:56:41,842 --> 00:56:43,742
Now get on down there
and keep your eyes open.

828
00:56:43,911 --> 00:56:46,607
If anything important happens,
you know where to find me.

Oh, darling, please be careful.

830
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:26,643
Careful of what?

831
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:29,653
Just because your name's rod ackroyd,
you needn't be so reckless.

832
00:57:29,823 --> 00:57:30,847
Reckless?

833
00:57:31,025 --> 00:57:33,926
You know, sometimes i think
you're still in love with that sheriff.

834
00:57:34,094 --> 00:57:38,554
- Don't tell me he's still hanging around.
- No, but i don't want any trouble.

835
00:57:38,732 --> 00:57:40,495
There won't be any.

ever since our fathers settled here.

mean nothing to you, they do to me.

01:03:01,655 --> 01:03:06,922
And whatever it costs in lives and property,
you can blame it on one man:

916
01:03:07,094 --> 01:03:08,652
Morgan lane.

917
01:03:11,465 --> 01:03:15,196
Jack: Everybody on the cattle side,
let's get out of here.

918
01:03:34,621 --> 01:03:35,747
Well, lane...

919
01:03:36,556 --> 01:03:39,457
...iooks like
the young lady's declared war.

920
01:03:39,893 --> 01:03:41,485
Looks like it.

921
01:03:42,195 --> 01:03:44,959
- Does that change your decision?
- Not at all.

Ackro yd: I'm gonna tell this
to all of you once more.

926
01:05:45,418 --> 01:05:48,080
Monte, you take your men
and round up the cattle on the ridge...

927
01:05:48,255 --> 01:05:49,745
...and start them rolling.
- Yes, sir.

928
01:05:49,923 --> 01:05:53,586
Kane, you and your men will meet them
at the foot of the ridge with the valley herd.

929
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,025
Allen, you join them at the same place
with the steers from the mesa.

930
01:05:57,197 --> 01:05:58,755
You all drive through the draw.

931
01:05:58,932 --> 01:06:01,162
That's where you'll be, canby,
with the river herd.

932
01:06:01,334 --> 01:06:04,599
I want every head of cattle on the range
at the north end of blackstone canyon...

933
01:06:04,771 --> 01:06:06,170
...and i want them there fast.

934
01:06:06,339 --> 01:06:07,806
That's an order.

935
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:26,418
Your friend morgan may know
something about sheep...

936
01:06:26,593 --> 01:06:29,289
...but today he's gonna learn
about cattle.

937
01:06:49,082 --> 01:06:52,381
Mackenzie, start them moving.

938
01:07:26,453 --> 01:07:27,943
This ain't no official call.

939
01:07:28,121 --> 01:07:30,885
I heard you aimed to get your sheep
onto the forsythe range.

940
01:07:31,057 --> 01:07:34,686
- So i rode out to warn you not to try it.
- We don't need any warning.

941
01:07:34,861 --> 01:07:38,456
I'm talking to you now outside my badge.
Outside my office too.

942
01:07:38,632 --> 01:07:41,157
Your sheep will never get through,
nor you neither.

943
01:07:41,334 --> 01:07:42,358
We'll see.

944
01:07:42,535 --> 01:07:45,663
The ackroyd-singleton outfit's
been rounding up all their cattle...

945
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:49,798
...and they aim to ride you down and stomp
you to death in blackstone canyon.

Thanks.

You heard what he said, boys.
You still with me?

Man 1: Yeah.
Man 2: Sure we are.

Let's go and stop that stampede.

I'm riding with you, lane.

Officially?

01:08:03,957 --> 01:08:06,084
No, for personal reasons.

Get them down to the canyon.

All right, let's get these cattle moving.

that way. Come on, sheriff.

Slow down, you critters!

01:11:56,589 --> 01:11:57,681
They've turned the herd.

969
01:11:57,857 --> 01:12:00,519
I'll ride to the ranch
and tell them what happened.

970
01:12:05,765 --> 01:12:08,199
That's a mighty fine job, boys.

971
01:12:08,601 --> 01:12:10,660
Let's get back to the sheep
and we'll take them in.

Which way?

973
01:12:12,238 --> 01:12:14,206
Right through town.

What's happened?
Where's rod and the rest?

975
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:33,891
Rod was killed when lane and his outfit
turned our cattle back.

- Did the sheep get through?
- Yes, ma'am.

Lane's heading them toward town
and there's nobody left to stop them.

Our cattle's spread all over the hills.
It will take us two days to round them up.
