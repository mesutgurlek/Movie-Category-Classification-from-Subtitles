1
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,744
- Have a nice trip?
- Yes. Very nice.

2
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:32,623
- Expecting someone?
- I guess not.

3
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,819
Say, where's the stage office?

4
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,223
Right over there, back of the depot.

5
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:38,455
Thank you.

6
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,378
Doggone your hide, Blossom. Look at that.

7
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,746
Look what you went and done.

8
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,445
I am telling you, Blossom,
that makes you...

9
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,854
the most aggravating female
I ever had a despise for.

10
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:06,616
I ought to poison you.

11
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,601
- Howdy.
- That the stage for Santa Inez?

12
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,261
Leaves in a minute. We've just got...

13
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,363
a couple passengers
to pick up at the hotel.

14
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,908
Santa Inez, $17.50.

15
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,039
- Your name?
- Rocklin.

16
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,447
Mind if I ride alongside the driver?

17
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,782
It's all right with me
if it's all right with Dave.

18
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,878
He's mad. It's his last trip.

19
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,946
Had a row with Harolday, the boss.

20
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,389
Old-timer, Dave.

21
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,326
- Grumpy old cuss. I can remember...
- I like grumpy old cusses.

22
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,657
Hope to live long enough to be one.

23
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:01,136
Here's your mail, Dave.

24
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,174
And one more passenger.

25
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,286
Mind if I ride here?

26
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,924
- Where's them women?
- Up at the hotel.

27
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,285
Why ain't they here?
This is the stage depot, ain't it?

28
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,955
You can pick them up there.
It's just up the street.

29
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,003
"It's just up the street."
And they can't walk it?

30
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,229
What's the matter?

31
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,433
Don't easterners have legs like other folk?

32
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,071
Hold tight when you get
in the mountains, mister.

33
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:35,740
When he gets riled, you can hear
the passengers praying for miles.

34
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,829
Where are them women?
Waiting for you to carry them out?

35
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,160
Hey, Dave.

36
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,668
Will you tell Arly Harolday
her saddle ain't ready yet?

37
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,034
I ain't telling that crazy female nothing.

38
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:02,165
Last time I see her, she threatened
to rip the hide off me...

39
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,470
and bat me dizzy with it.

40
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:06,410
Say, mister, will you tell the agent
at Santa Inez...

41
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,277
to tell Miss Harolday
her saddle ain't ready yet.

42
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,282
- I'll say that.
- Thank you.

43
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,216
- This trunk go?
- Yes, it goes.

44
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:22,218
By next year, madam, we expect to have
a bathtub on every floor.

45
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,261
Don't drop it!

46
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,730
At your age,
you best not be lifting things so heavy.

47
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,632
Maybe you're young enough
to hoist it up there your own self.

48
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,727
Dave will have his little jokes.

49
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,440
Clara!

50
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,113
Staring as if you've never seen
a man before in your life.

51
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,717
I hope you have a nice trip, ladies.

52
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,625
If we get there.
Wouldn't surprise me if we didn't.

53
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,297
You wait till I get you on the road.

54
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,562
- Ever ride with Dave before, mister?
- Nope.

55
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,366
Then try and hold him down.
He'll scare the women to death.

56
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,567
I never feel sorry
for anything that happens to a woman.

57
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,983
Wonder why a young fella
who don't have to...

58
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,552
wants to come into
this dad-blamed country.

59
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,604
You mean what you said back there
about women?

60
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,699
Yep.

61
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:47,408
Then you're smarter than most.

62
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,013
Maybe I've seen more of them than most.

63
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,479
Shouldn't be surprised.

64
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,614
Shouldn't be a little mite surprised.

65
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,486
All the same...

66
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,285
Have a snort.

67
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,945
Whisky and women.
You ever think how much alike they are?

68
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:26,175
They both fool you, but you never figure
how to do without them.

69
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,751
- Have another.
- Not just yet, thanks.

70
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,223
- Well, here's to her.
- Who?

71
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,282
The next one that fools you.

72
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:42,262
- Want me to spell you for a while?
- Nope.

73
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:45,498
I've had a couple of snorts,
but that don't make no difference.

74
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,562
Leastwise, never has.

75
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,244
Don't ever get old and wore-out
and useless like me.

76
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,474
- Who says you are?
- Boss Harolday, for one.

77
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:02,681
I ain't bellyaching.
I reckon he's entitled to his opinion...

78
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,656
but him and me never did see eye to eye.

79
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:10,084
- What's wrong?
- It's constitutional, I reckon.

80
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,096
He's too darn sane,
believing in law and order.

81
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,225
What's wrong with law and order?

82
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,731
That depends on who's dishing it out.

83
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,774
I never was much on taking orders myself.

84
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,100
And as for the law...

85
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,905
you'll find out what that means
around these parts.

86
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,886
Driver!

87
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,856
- Driver, what's the matter?
- Nothing. Resting the horses.

88
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,163
You can get out
and stretch your legs if you like.

89
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,896
Resting horses? What for?

90
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,234
I can see with my own eyes it's downhill.

91
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,570
Are you in such an all-fired hurry, lady?

92
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,438
Certainly we're in a hurry!

93
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,537
Then, we'll hurry some.

94
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:42,980
Help!

95
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,925
Help!

96
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,923
Now what's the matter?
Why are you stopping again?

97
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,318
Indigestion.

98
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,387
Why do we stop here?

99
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,069
- Somebody say something?
- I did! Why do we stop here?

100
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,395
If you want to eat and stretch your legs.

101
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,804
Will you please stop referring to my legs?

102
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,535
You got some, ain't you?

103
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:18,975
Zeke!

104
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:23,879
Dave!

105
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,455
- You two-legged old sidewinder.
- Howdy do, ladies.

106
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,033
- How about something to eat?
- lf it won't take too long.

107
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,400
Right this way.

108
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,604
You know, Zeke, this is my last trip.

109
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:45,566
Why?

110
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,239
'Cause Harolday won't take back
what he said.

111
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,373
No? What did he say?

112
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:51,846
"You're fired."

113
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,817
Here you are, folks.
Just dig in and help yourself.

114
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,794
Ain't you gonna eat, mister?

115
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,454
I'll have some coffee.

116
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,701
- Supper, Dave?
- No. I'm drinking mine.

117
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:12,964
Set them up.

118
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,302
Young man, our driver's had
all the liquor he can take.

119
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:17,667
Has he?

120
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:20,735
You know he has.
You're not a complete fool, are you?

121
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:21,939
Frequently.

122
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,115
The rudeness of people in these parts
is appalling.

123
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,765
Mighty nice aroma of veal around here.

124
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,597
Doing yourself pretty well
these days, Stan?

125
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,399
A friend of mine was by,
sold me a quarter of beef.

126
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,235
Same friend that sold you that hide...

127
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:51,401
Bob here found hidden away
in your barn yesterday?

128
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,138
Hide? What hide?

129
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,404
One that might send you
to the penitentiary.

130
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:59,315
- What did you do with it, Stan?
- I never had no hide hidden out.

131
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,910
I saw it yesterday under the hay.

132
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,056
- It must still be there.
- No, it ain't. We looked.

133
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,182
Where is it?

134
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,317
- I tell you...
- What is all this?

135
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,985
Afternoon, ma'am. Miss Cardell, ain't it?

136
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,397
- Martin. Miss Martin. This is Miss Cardell.
- Pleased to meet you, miss.

137
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,698
Been expecting you down at Santa Inez.

138
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,761
I'm Sheriff Jackson.

139
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,172
- What's going on with him?
- Just a little matter of the law.

140
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,039
- Rustling.
- A thief.

141
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,601
- I tell you...
- Save it!

142
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:30,012
Matter of fact, Bob here says
the hide he saw yesterday...

143
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,913
had the KC brand on it.

144
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:34,185
What do you intend doing about it?

145
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,653
The law's pretty harsh around here
on cattle thieves.

146
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:39,623
Of course, we don't want
to make no mistake with an old-timer...

147
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,785
How about the owner of that beef?

148
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,895
Might he not have something
to say about it?

149
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,158
- Meaning?
- Red Cardell.

150
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,494
He's the owner of the KC, isn't he?

151
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,229
You're way behind the herd, mister.

152
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,498
Red Cardell died three weeks ago.

153
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,164
- Was murdered, you mean.
- That's right.

154
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,799
Shot in the back not far from here.

155
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,366
Maybe he was getting onto things...

156
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,969
about the cattle that's been missing
from the KC lately.

157
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,446
- I tell you, I never had no hide.
- You got beef.

158
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,508
Yeah, and I got a bill of sale for it, too.

159
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,945
Suppose you let me see that bill of sale.

160
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,758
Sure. It's right out here.

161
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:18,325
Like I said, I wouldn't want to
make no mistake with an old-timer.

162
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,695
That's her. The old one.

163
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,506
- She ain't got no legs.
- Hold your tongue!

164
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:30,664
And you.

165
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,437
Stop staring as if we were monsters.

166
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,573
We have to have another drink.

167
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:39,208
- Where's Stan?
- He's inside, explaining away a hide.

168
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,048
It seems they're eating stolen beef.

169
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:44,921
Somebody's loco.

170
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:48,083
Stan might give house-room
to a little dead beef...

171
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,129
but he'd never be fool enough
to leave the hide laying around.

172
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,664
How about it, Zeke?

173
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,157
That's the way it is, Dave.

174
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,872
- It's you, huh?
- Yeah, your old pal Bob Clews.

175
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,911
Get away from me,
you two-timing horse thief.

176
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,037
Them's fighting words, partner.

177
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,807
Stan, don't let them hang nothing on you
you ain't done.

178
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:15,351
They're just a couple of four flushers,
the pair of them.

179
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,912
- Everybody knows that.
- Crazy drunk.

180
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,886
Sure I'm drunk.

181
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,127
That's why I'm telling the truth.

182
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,594
I'm drunk, and I'll say what I think.

183
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,197
I'll say what I know.

184
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:29,098
Don't act up this ways, Dave.
There's women watching.

185
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:33,229
- Take your dirty paws off me.
- What he needs is a short lay-down.

186
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:37,301
Me and Bob will look after him.
Come on, Bob. We're his friends.

187
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,776
Take your hands off me.
I can take care of myself.

188
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,506
Careful, now. Don't hurt him.

189
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:48,953
How are things standing now
between you and the law?

190
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,180
All right, I reckon.

191
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,418
I guess this bill of sale kind of winded him.

192
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,619
Lucky you saved it.

193
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:59,630
- We laid him down. He went right to sleep.
- Good.

194
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:02,599
Sorry to have a ruckus like this
in front of you ladies...

195
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,569
but Dave's an ornery old cuss
when he gets going.

196
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,998
Too drunk to drive on, I'm afraid.

197
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,136
Don't worry, ma'am.
Bob here will take you on in.

198
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,075
He knows every inch
of the road, don't you?

199
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:14,840
- You bet.
- I'm driving.

200
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,884
But if anything was to happen
to the ladies, I'd feel to blame.

201
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,180
Don't.

202
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,249
<i>Señor.</i>

203
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,149
- Did they do it?
- They hit him with a <i>pistola.</i>

204
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,252
His friends, eh?

205
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,206
What happened this time?

206
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,979
- Bumped his head.
- Where? On Iron Mountain?

207
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,785
Where's the best chance of a cheap room?

208
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,948
Cap's place across the street,
the Sunup Saloon.

209
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,491
- Saloon?
- Saloon.

210
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,853
- Where's the hotel?
- Up the street a piece, lady.

211
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,294
Are we expected to carry our bags
this time of night?

212
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,332
- Do you want to drive them on up?
- Nope.

213
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,890
I'll pick up my saddle tomorrow.

214
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,800
Well?

215
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,146
Hey, Doc, customer.

216
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,153
Take my hand, Shorty.

217
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:08,985
What happened here?

218
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:12,724
- Bumped his head.
- So I see.

219
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,157
Looks like he's going to need
a couple or so stitches.

220
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,328
You better get him up to a room.
I'll get a key.

221
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,100
- Book me for one, too.
- I'll help you with him.

222
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,619
He'll be all right.

223
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,423
How about a little snort?

224
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,686
- Don't mind if I do.
- Come along.

225
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,261
- Will he make it?
- Sure he'll make it.

226
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,493
You can't kill off an old jug-wallow
like Dave that easy.

227
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:49,893
You're right.

228
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,959
I reckon Saint Peter's getting
mighty weary...

229
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,471
dusting off that doormat for him.

230
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,502
- What'll you have?
- Whisky.

231
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:57,836
Same.

232
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:01,210
- By the way, how'd you say it happened?
- I didn't.

233
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,411
That's right. You didn't.

234
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,478
The reason I ask,
there were a couple of fellas in here...

235
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,784
that said that Dave was kicking up
quite a ruckus up at Stan's place.

236
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,518
Sheriff Jackson it was, and Bob Clews.

237
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,526
Tough customers, those Clews boys.

238
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,722
It don't pay to start nothing with them
you don't intend to finish.

239
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:19,821
No.

240
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,196
Say, Doc, they tell me
George is getting out again.

241
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,235
Yes! That's Bob Clews' brother.

242
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:27,101
Just did a stretch in the penitentiary
for horse stealing.

243
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,231
They string them up for that
where I come from.

244
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:32,675
Too bad they didn't string Clews up
while they were about it.

245
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,245
- Here's how.
- Mud.

246
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,847
That's a good hand.

247
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,579
What did I tell you?
They got to be big to beat me.

248
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,553
Clint Harolday's luck is good tonight, huh?

249
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,489
They're certainly running for him.
It's about time.

250
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:49,957
He's taken a beating this last week
that would shake a better man.

251
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,290
Include me out.

252
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:54,457
- Come on. Can't you take it?
- Not with that kind of luck, I can't.

253
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,626
Besides, I only sat in to oblige.

254
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:01,038
Come on, Doc.
I still got to take something from you.

255
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,368
No more tonight, son.

256
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,103
How about you, sir? Care to sit in?

257
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,202
I must warn you
that our young friend here...

258
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,837
is holding phenomenal cards.

259
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:12,714
- Don't mind if I do.
- That's fine.

260
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,452
- This is Pat Fosler.
- How are you?

261
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,080
- Ab Jenkins.
- How are you?

262
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,785
Shorty Davis, and Clint Harolday.

263
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:24,490
My name is Garvey. Judge Garvey, sir.
I don't believe I got yours.

264
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:27,657
- Rocklin.
- How do you do, sir? Please sit down.

265
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,324
Anybody got any change?

266
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:33,530
You won't need any change
in this game, mister.

267
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:36,438
- I'll let you have some, sir.
- Deal, Ab.

268
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,001
I'm up.

269
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,448
Your bet.

270
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,478
It's open for $3.

271
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:00,222
- I'm out.
- Raise you $20.

272
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,358
- I'm out.
- Beats me.

273
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,367
Call you for $6.

274
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,460
Dig.

275
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,269
- Table stakes, Clint.
- Not if he wants to dig.

276
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,145
Got you beat.

277
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,449
- Cards?
- One.

278
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,021
One for me.

279
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,522
That queen is dead.

280
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,626
- Or I can take it if I want it.
- Sure, if you want...

281
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,098
but you got to beat my hand
with four cards.

282
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,603
I'm playing these, mister.

283
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,710
I'm not setting in.

284
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,975
Why don't you boys split the pot?

285
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,948
I'm not splitting. I'm betting.

286
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:53,910
You calling?

287
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:55,976
Nope.

288
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,946
I'm raising.

289
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,324
Dig.

290
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:06,953
Let me have some money.

291
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,296
You're in deep enough already, Clint.

292
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,327
I have called for all I've got.

293
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,800
Full house.

294
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,902
Kings up win. That third queen is dead.

295
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,304
Mister, get away from that table
and get out of here.

296
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,008
Maybe from now on you'll know...

297
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:27,415
a full house beats two pairs,
you four-flusher.

298
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:40,861
He wasn't armed, Clint.

299
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:44,163
I don't like to tell men how to play cards
when I'm not sitting in...

300
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,170
but maybe I ought to have spoken up.

301
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,103
That queen was dead, Clint,
and you know it.

302
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:51,802
When anybody plays poker with me,
they play my game or not at all.

303
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:56,378
If I was you, I'd hightail it out of here
before he comes back.

304
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,643
- Comes back.
- He's the kind.

305
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,963
I've come for my money.

306
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:20,994
Sure.

307
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,937
I guess I was wrong about that queen.

308
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:27,839
Cap's an old gambler,
and he says you were right all the time.

309
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:31,713
I'm willing to take Cap's word for it
because, as I said, he...

310
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:36,043
Good night, gentlemen.

311
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,450
Funny thing about that card.

312
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,290
Why, if I'd known for sure
it was dead like Cap said...

313
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,297
He's gone to bed, Clint.

314
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,289
Who are you?

315
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:22,297
- How are you feeling?
- Fine.

316
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:24,995
Indigestion?

317
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,060
Yeah.

318
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:28,704
Nice place you got here.

319
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:31,299
This isn't my place. It's the Sunup Saloon.

320
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,207
Saloon?

321
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:39,305
Saloon.

322
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:42,915
See you later.

323
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,183
Saloon.

324
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,263
I knocked, but I guess you didn't hear me.

325
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:00,702
What do you want?

326
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:04,298
Looks like you kind of stirred things up
around here last night, stranger.

327
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:07,937
- Is that what you came to say?
- Nope. Got a message for you.

328
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,608
Somebody wants to see you out front.

329
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,205
Who?

330
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,312
Why don't you go down and find out?

331
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,113
I will.

332
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,493
- What's going on over there?
- Arly Harolday's on the warpath.

333
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,901
I just talked to him.
He ought to be down any minute.

334
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:33,037
Here he comes now. Watch the fun.

335
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:47,448
- Your name Rocklin?
- Yes, ma'am.

336
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,215
You took some money
from my brother last night.

337
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,852
- Did I?
- You took it at the point of a gun...

338
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,119
and I'm taking it back the same way.

339
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,462
- You're Arly Harolday.
- Dig!

340
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,334
I was told to say
that your saddle isn't ready yet.

341
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:10,966
Stop!

342
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,808
Stop or I'll kill you!

343
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,551
Turn around. Turn around!

344
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:41,163
Whisky.

345
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:45,967
You lied to me, didn't you?

346
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,342
Don't think I'll forget this,
making a fool of me...

347
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:51,439
in front of the whole town.
I'll see you at the ranch.

348
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,546
Was that a close shave.

349
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:57,086
Why, she'd just as soon hit you
as miss you.

350
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,521
You don't know how lucky you were, son.

351
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,524
Why do you think I need this?

352
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:06,527
Say, that was the funniest thing
I ever saw.

353
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,123
That Arly is madder than a loco heifer.

354
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,464
- You sure get the...
- Get out of here!

355
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:22,311
You broke it!

356
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,010
That calls for one on the house.

357
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,986
Come on. Come in here.

358
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:35,219
Who handled Red Cardell's business?

359
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:38,023
- Judge Garvey.
- Know where I could find him?

360
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:41,156
He rooms behind his office
across the street over there.

361
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:44,633
He doesn't usually raise the blinds,
though, until about noon.

362
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:48,799
- See you later.
- Thanks.

363
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,971
Boy, has somebody come to town.

364
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,159
Come in.

365
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:18,358
Mr. Rocklin, good morning.
Come in, sir. Come right in.

366
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:21,030
That was quite a poker game
we had last night, wasn't it?

367
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,631
- Yes.
- Excuse me. I'll get my coat.

368
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:27,606
Yes, sir, that was
quite a little poker game.

369
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,237
What can I do for you, sir?

370
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,544
I understand you were
Red Cardell's lawyer.

371
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:35,074
- I was. Yes, that's right.
- You know anything about this?

372
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:42,825
"Dear Rocklin, glad you have
made up your mind to come.

373
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:47,160
"Enclosed find train fare
and $150 advance on your wages."

374
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,997
$150?

375
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,297
I don't quite understand.

376
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:55,396
I don't know why Red
should have wanted to hire you.

377
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:56,497
Why not?

378
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:58,272
I don't know.

379
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,538
It's true that he did
a lot of peculiar things...

380
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,671
but I don't know
where he could have used you.

381
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:05,978
Of course, if you'd like to go on
as an extra hand...

382
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:07,676
Excuse me.

383
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:14,224
- Good morning, ladies.
- Judge Garvey, I presume?

384
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,987
- Yes, and you are?
- I'm Miss Martin.

385
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,825
- This is my niece Clara Cardell.
- How do you do?

386
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,988
Come in, please, and sit down.

387
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,057
You arrived at
a very opportune moment, madam.

388
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:26,626
As the new owner of the KC Ranch,
I'm sure you'll be interested to know...

389
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,696
that this gentleman claims
to have a letter...

390
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:31,139
"Claims to have"? You read it, didn't you?

391
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,804
Has a letter, shall we say, then,
from the late Mr. Cardell...

392
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,210
engaging him to work on the KC.

393
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:39,250
You can't hold us to account
for every promise made by that man.

394
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:42,480
Everybody knows he wasn't responsible
for his actions half the time.

395
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,546
And if you think I'd have you work
on the ranch in any capacity...

396
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:48,456
Lady, I'd rather walk for somebody else
than ride for you.

397
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:49,823
What impudence!

398
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,686
The only reason I came here today...

399
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:54,732
was to pay back the $150
Red Cardell sent in advance.

400
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,391
- No.
- Don't interfere, Clara.

401
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:57,833
Of course he must pay it back.

402
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,393
As far as the railroad fare is concerned...

403
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:04,272
I reckon we can check that off
to time lost, call it quits.

404
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:05,707
But, mister, I...

405
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:09,405
- I'm sorry. I don't know your name.
- Rocklin, miss.

406
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:12,241
It isn't fair for you to pay anything back.

407
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,785
I'd prefer it that way, if you don't mind.

408
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,853
I have a message for you.

409
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,721
- About what?
- Wait a minute.

410
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,427
I just heard they let George Clews out
of the penitentiary...

411
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:28,091
and you can tell him
if he sets foot on the Topaz Ranch...

412
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,293
I'll shoot him on sight.

413
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:33,837
But, Miss Arly, I don't know
why you should...

414
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,736
want to deliver your message through me.

415
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:39,265
- You have mutual friends.
- lf you're referring to Sheriff Jackson...

416
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,608
- I am.
- But that's absurd, Miss Arly.

417
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,909
The fact that he employs
one of Clews brothers...

418
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,415
doesn't make the other his friend.

419
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:48,179
Have it your own way, but warn him.
I mean it.

420
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:50,987
Miss Harolday, this is Miss Cardell.

421
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:52,215
- How do you do?
- Hello.

422
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,882
And Miss Martin, her aunt.

423
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,653
- Hello.
- How do you do?

424
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:59,424
I think you should know each other,
seeing that you're going to be neighbors.

425
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:02,159
Miss Harolday runs the Topaz Ranch
for her stepfather.

426
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:05,669
She's a famous horsewoman
in these parts.

427
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:09,136
I saw you ride into town this morning.
You looked lovely.

428
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,364
Yes?

429
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,273
Harolday wants to see you
down at his office.

430
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:17,473
What about?

431
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:20,274
He's got a proposition to make
about riding for him.

432
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:23,411
- $60 a month.
- That's foreman's wages.

433
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:27,218
I wouldn't give you a red cent,
but it's his money.

434
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,687
The way things are shaping up
around the ranch...

435
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:32,025
maybe we could do with somebody
as mean as you.

436
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:35,657
I warn you, Miss Harolday,
you're making a great mistake.

437
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,227
Do you want the job?

438
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,430
Lead the way.

439
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:51,408
Why did you have to say that?
I simply don't understand you.

440
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,347
But I understand you.

441
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:56,846
You should be ashamed,
throwing yourself at a man like that.

442
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,855
Why, I...

443
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:08,356
- You must excuse her. She's young.
- And inexperienced.

444
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:11,231
Young people must be protected
from themselves at times.

445
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,930
- Don't you agree?
- Exactly.

446
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,805
- He following you?
- Not following me. He's with me.

447
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,440
He's always with me.

448
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,976
- Just an old friend.
- Best friend I've got.

449
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,055
Wait here.

450
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,662
I just hired a man named Rocklin,
said you made me do it.

451
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,504
$60, and he'll earn it, while he lasts.

452
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,601
Arly, you know we don't need
any more help.

453
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,374
- Why did you do it?
- So I can fire him.

454
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:58,472
I hate him.

455
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:01,109
Clint and he quarreled last night.
Clint lied about it...

456
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:02,550
and I made a fool of myself.

457
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,747
- He's outside.
- Arly, wait.

458
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,490
Come in.

459
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,059
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

460
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:24,700
Mr. Rocklin, what happened
between you and my stepson last night?

461
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:26,604
Poker.

462
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,438
About this suggestion,
you working for me...

463
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:34,917
- It was your suggestion, not mine.
- Yes, that's right.

464
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,615
$60 is big money.

465
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,190
- lf you've changed your mind, l...
- No. Wait a minute.

466
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,754
I take it you've had the experience.

467
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:47,058
- Enough for Red Cardell to hire me.
- Red Cardell hired you?

468
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,692
Yes, but I won't ride for the new owner,
so it leaves me open.

469
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:53,498
I see. Were you a friend of Red's?

470
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,530
Nope.

471
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:58,603
Rock, George Clews is in town.

472
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:02,237
He seen what you done to Bob
and he's looking for you.

473
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:07,683
Tell him I'll be outside in the street
in front of the saloon.

474
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,543
Yeah.

475
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,920
Get them children out of here.

476
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,353
Get out, Joe. There's going to be trouble.

477
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:24,257
Clear the street! Hurry up, everybody!

478
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,238
I'm gonna get his ears.

479
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,234
You, George Clews.

480
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:39,581
Rocklin said if you don't come out,
he's coming in here to tear you apart.

481
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,580
That was my beer, you know?

482
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:50,058
If he comes in again, I'll throw you.

483
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:56,191
- I'm gonna get his ears.
- His ears are outside.

484
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:00,931
- Come on.
- How about those drinks?

485
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:02,969
Pay him.

486
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,573
Pardon me, ladies.
Would you mind stepping inside?

487
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,340
Inside? Why?

488
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,643
- I think it might be safer.
- Safer?

489
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,626
Touch that gun and I'll kill you.

490
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,634
Did you want to see me?

491
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,205
Why, you...

492
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,580
I saw you! I saw you strike that poor man!

493
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:25,119
Yes, ma'am, just as hard as I could.

494
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:34,658
Hey, you. What you been up to?

495
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:38,099
I just laid the gun barrel across the head
of a drunk friend of yours...

496
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:39,796
like you did yesterday.

497
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,666
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You're a liar.

498
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:47,208
You look here, young fella.
You keep on talking like that...

499
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:49,303
and you'll find yourself
in a heap of trouble.

500
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,745
Don't say you ain't been warned!

501
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:01,988
- Say, that was...
- What were you saying about Cardell?

502
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,158
You being hired by Red Cardell
only confirms what I'd suspected.

503
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:09,992
- He was getting ready to fight.
- Fight? Who?

504
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,534
Organized rustling.

505
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,499
At least, that's my belief.

506
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,903
Red was no friend of mine.
He was too fond of...

507
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:17,941
taking the law into his own hands.

508
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,739
But he had my sympathy.
He'd been harder hit than any of us.

509
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,779
To top it all, he lost his foreman.

510
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,371
You mean he quit on him?

511
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,246
No. He was shot.
Shot in the back by a bullet...

512
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,650
from the same caliber rifle as got Red.

513
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,154
Got any ideas?

514
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:36,382
No, except the man you just
pistol-whipped is in on it somewhere.

515
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:39,722
It's a pity you didn't kill him
when you had the chance.

516
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,498
Say, it doesn't sound like
it's going to be so easy...

517
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,398
on those women at the KC.

518
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,896
Want to go back and work for them?

519
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:48,836
Nope.

520
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,641
And I'm not jumping
at this offer of yours, either...

521
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,109
'cause I don't hold
with working for women.

522
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:58,137
You mean my stepdaughter?
Don't worry. She won't interfere with you.

523
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:01,809
Rocklin, I figure we've been losing cattle
over a place called Tabletop.

524
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,982
It's the back way into the Topaz Ranch
and a perfect route for rustlers.

525
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,048
I'm going to send you up to the line camp.

526
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,854
Don't mind working a Ione hand, do you?

527
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:12,657
- I like working that way.
- Good. How soon can you move out?

528
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,357
As soon as I can get my gear together.

529
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,957
You bring it here,
and I'll see it gets up to the ranch.

530
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,023
Fine.

531
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:23,403
Now, Pat, I'm giving you first call
on my services.

532
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:26,971
There's a lot of other folks
looking for a good man, too, you know?

533
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,535
So if you want me,
better hurry and speak up.

534
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,878
I ain't got no time to...

535
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:35,611
Excuse me. I'll be right back
to find out when to start.

536
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,878
Where you heading for?

537
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:40,287
- Riding for the Topaz.
- What?

538
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:42,792
- Have you gone plumb loco?
- It's good money.

539
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,158
There ain't money enough
to make it worthwhile...

540
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:46,253
to work for that woman.

541
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:50,027
When she gets going, she can be meaner
than a skillet full of rattlesnakes.

542
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,899
She ain't gonna forget
the way you made a fool out of her...

543
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,267
in front of the whole town.

544
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:55,703
- Dave!
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

545
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:59,504
- It's poison, that's what it is. Just plain...
- Dave!

546
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,907
What do you want
to hang around here for anyhow?

547
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,471
$60 a month.

548
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,848
Be right with you.

549
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,536
- How do you do, Mr. Rocklin?
- Howdy.

550
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,441
It's a lovely afternoon, isn't it?

551
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,480
I reckon it is pretty nice.

552
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:41,174
- So you're moving in on the KC?
- Not exactly moving in.

553
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,584
- You see, we're...
- Clara, do you have to discuss...

554
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:48,318
our private affairs with every ragtag
and bobtail cow person we meet?

555
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,826
Just passing the time of day, ma'am.

556
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:53,796
We can do very well without it, thank you.

557
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:56,628
Besides, you're keeping
your lady friend waiting.

558
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:15,547
I thought maybe
you'd changed your mind again.

559
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:16,847
Nope.

560
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:36,503
Tala will show you the bunkhouse.

561
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:39,407
I'll talk to you about your duties
in the morning.

562
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:02,261
How far is it to the line camp at Tabletop?

563
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,301
10, 15 mile.

564
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,494
I'll be moving up there
first thing in the morning.

565
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,505
Harolday's orders.

566
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,702
Care to show me the way?

567
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:14,342
I will show you.

568
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,936
The trail is straight ahead.

569
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,946
You'll find everything you need
in the cabin at the top.

570
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:52,949
Tala, it appears you don't like me.

571
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:56,585
- That's right. I do not.
- Why?

572
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,181
Permit that I offer you a cigarette.

573
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,088
Thanks.

574
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:08,927
It is not your fault
that your shadow is black.

575
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:12,824
But you will only bring unhappiness
to my Arlita.

576
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:14,762
I do not blame you...

577
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:17,836
but I feel I must hate you.

578
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:01,612
- Hi, there.
- I see you found a new job.

579
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,779
Yeah. I haul freight for old Pat Fosler.

580
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:08,182
Got a letter here
for that crazy galoot Rocklin...

581
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,460
from that little Cardell gal.

582
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,254
You know, she seems to be
mighty took up about something.

583
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,662
Made me promise to deliver it personal.

584
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:18,964
- But Rocklin is not here.
- You ain't telling me he's quit already?

585
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,937
- He's on the way to Tabletop.
- Doggone it!

586
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:25,533
And I've got a whole load of stuff
to deliver to Gopher Flats.

587
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:28,077
Maybe you can take
the old road to Tabletop?

588
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:30,409
- Is it still open?
- Yes, I think so.

589
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:32,844
Here I go, then. So long.

590
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:42,257
Have you seen Arly?

591
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:46,524
No, sir, I didn't see Miss Arly today
but I seed her last night...

592
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,121
and she sure was mad.

593
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,891
Plenty mad.

594
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:56,935
Morning, Clint.

595
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,468
You must be feeling pretty good
this morning.

596
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:04,374
Say, Arly, about that poker game
night before last...

597
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:06,279
- Forget it.
- Forget it?

598
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:08,514
Tala!

599
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:12,551
- Well?
- Say, what is this?

600
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,684
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

601
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,352
Good morning, Arlita.

602
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,828
Good morning, Tala.

603
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:21,660
You have made yourself very pretty today.

604
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:23,324
See what I mean?

605
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:34,171
Have my horse saddled
and sent around right away, will you?

606
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:37,443
And have that Rocklin bring it.

607
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:41,981
Well? What are you grinning at?

608
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,048
Rocklin is not here.

609
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,346
He quit?

610
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:47,982
- He has gone to the line camp at Tabletop.
- What?

611
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:50,253
It was Mr. Harolday's orders.

612
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:55,926
Why do you make your heart heavy
with thoughts of him, little one?

613
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,195
- He's not for you.
- Be quiet.

614
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:02,261
He has made the choice, Arlita.
With your own eyes, you saw it yesterday.

615
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,637
And she, too, has opened her heart to him.

616
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:07,108
Already she has summoned him to her.

617
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:08,508
What do you mean?

618
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:12,015
Dave of the white beard
carries a letter to Rocklin. It is from her.

619
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:13,106
How did you know that?

620
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:16,710
I met Dave, and he tell me.
So now he rides to Tabletop.

621
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:20,553
- Little one, why don't...
- Leave me...

622
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:31,227
Good morning, Arly. Good morning, Tala.

623
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:34,700
Say, fetch my briefcase, will you?
It's on the desk.

624
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,533
Get it.

625
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,833
Looks like we're getting that land
we were wanting along the river bottom.

626
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:43,539
I bought the mortgage
on the Hardman ranch.

627
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:46,310
It's due today. I'm on my way
over there now.

628
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:48,078
Did you send that Rocklin to Tabletop?

629
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,552
- Why, yes, I did.
- Let's get things straight.

630
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,112
This place was my mother's,
now it's mine and Clint's.

631
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,283
You've helped out,
but the way things are going...

632
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,520
we'll be able to pay you back
every penny we owe.

633
00:44:57,594 --> 00:45:00,893
Meanwhile, I'm running this outfit,
and I expect to give the orders.

634
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:02,056
You generally do.

635
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:04,157
Why did you send Rocklin to Tabletop?

636
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:07,362
It seemed like a good idea,
what with all this rustling going on.

637
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:10,339
Who'd be driving cattle over Tabletop
unless they were crazy?

638
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:11,704
Now, I don't agree with you.

639
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:13,640
At any rate, if you must have it...

640
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,271
I'd no intention of engaging a man
at foreman's wages...

641
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:18,337
just to gratify the whims
of a jealous woman.

642
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:20,144
You take care what you're saying.

643
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,276
No, it's you
who should take care, my dear.

644
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:25,879
There's one man that you can't rawhide
into jumping the way you want.

645
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:28,390
You made a fool of yourself over him once.

646
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:31,292
You better watch out
you don't do it again.

647
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,129
Thanks, Tala.

648
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:03,754
Darn funny, that storm quitting
about the time I get here.

649
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:07,160
No funnier than you slogging through,
to deliver a letter from a woman.

650
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:09,665
The older I get, the dumber I get.

651
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:14,830
When we gonna get around to reading it?

652
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:16,896
Thought I'd wait till morning.

653
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:20,239
Might be bad news,
and I wouldn't be able to sleep.

654
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:35,652
"Dear Mr. Rocklin...

655
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:39,651
"forgive me if this letter
seems a trifle incoherent...

656
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:41,831
"but I am terribly worried and unhappy."

657
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:44,561
Who wouldn't be,
living with that old screech owl?

658
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,365
Go ahead, go ahead. I can't read anyhow.

659
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,535
"I am desperately in need of help
and advice...

660
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:53,235
"from someone whom I feel I can trust.

661
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:57,540
"I heartily dislike and distrust
Judge Garvey."

662
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:58,979
Smart gal.

663
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:03,913
"But my aunt seems to have suddenly
revised her opinion of him...

664
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:08,720
"and now wants me to place all my affairs
in the Judge's hands and return east.

665
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,657
"Such is certainly not my wish."

666
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:13,787
Kind of looks like
she's formed an attachment.

667
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:15,855
For the locality, I mean.

668
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,536
"I wanted so much
to give ranch life a trial...

669
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:24,233
"but fear circumstances are against me.

670
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:28,105
"Especially in view
of the recent Indian trouble."

671
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:31,881
Indian trouble? Why, there isn't been
no Indian trouble around here...

672
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,383
You want to hear the rest of this?

673
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,880
Might as well. Come this far.

674
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:40,682
"I want to apologize
for what took place this afternoon...

675
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:43,191
"and I am returning the $150...

676
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:46,590
"because I feel it is rightfully yours.

677
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:51,130
"You must take it.
Faithfully yours, Clara Cardell."

678
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,263
Well, what do you make of it?

679
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:58,840
Somebody's sure busting
to get her off the ranch.

680
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:00,399
Indian trouble.

681
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:04,771
Got to admit, though,
I feel a mite sorry for that young 'un.

682
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:06,475
Nice little tyke.

683
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:09,342
Too nice for this country.

684
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,454
She sure is a pretty little thing.

685
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:17,493
Dave, what do you know
about Garvey and Cardell?

686
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:20,386
Cardell? Salt of the earth.

687
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:24,865
Cantankerous old cuss,
but a real tall man, believe me.

688
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:29,337
He was a big feller,
tall in the saddle, like yourself.

689
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:33,932
Fact is, you could pass for blood relation,
come to think of it.

690
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:37,847
- Were Red and the Judge friends?
- Yeah, that's what you'd say.

691
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,715
They were regular drinking partners,
played poker together most nights.

692
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:43,446
Red always got the worst of it.

693
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,545
Red was a gambler.

694
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,284
Oh, yeah. A mighty poor one, I reckon.

695
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:51,816
Still, you'd have to say
him and Garvey were friends.

696
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,829
Anything ever happen
to make you think they weren't?

697
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:10,439
Rock, I'm going to tell you something
I ain't told nobody before.

698
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:12,379
Sure you can trust me?

699
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,415
Last time I seen old Red
was the day he died.

700
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:19,114
It was in town.
He just come out of the stage office.

701
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:23,558
Tried to book passage for Garden City,
but couldn't on account of I had a full load.

702
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:27,324
Sir, he took me aside
and read me a printed piece of paper.

703
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:29,695
It was from one of them
Chicago sporting firms...

704
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:32,860
explaining how to manipulate
trick playing cards.

705
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:34,494
- Marked cards.
- Yeah.

706
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:36,801
Seemed Red found the cards
and this paper...

707
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:39,501
in the pocket of a coat
he borrowed from a friend once.

708
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:42,636
- Whose coat was it?
- Now, that's just what I asked.

709
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:45,045
All he said was
it belonged to a good friend.

710
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:47,174
He said he wasn't waiting
for the next stage...

711
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:50,811
but riding over to see the district judge
about it alone.

712
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,449
And that's when they got him?

713
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,449
Yeah. Just a mile or so from Stan's place.

714
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:01,097
A bullet in his back, pockets empty.

715
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:05,392
How come you never told anybody before?

716
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:08,267
Who was I going to tell? Sheriff Jackson?

717
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:13,472
How about what's-his-name, Harolday?
He's no friend of Garvey's, is he?

718
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:14,874
Hates his guts.

719
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:18,676
Sure riles him to see young Clint
hanging on the Judge's coattails.

720
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:22,947
All the same, I decided to keep
my mouth shut and my eyes open.

721
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:27,819
Even if it was Garvey
that Red was talking about...

722
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:30,591
don't follow that he killed him.

723
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,288
No. General opinion is, it was rustlers.

724
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:39,261
You all right?

725
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:42,066
Doggone it! I will be if I ever get dry.

726
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:48,838
- Hey, Look at that!
- Get down!

727
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:53,216
Jumping Jeremiah! Look at that!

728
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:55,912
Come on.

729
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:08,959
My team.

730
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:20,871
That's not your team. Come on.

731
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,920
You can't run him down afoot!

732
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:35,958
Maybe he'll double back.

733
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:00,869
Not bad shooting.

734
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:03,106
You think I did that?

735
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,114
Cutting it mighty close, though.

736
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:08,345
Good thing I haven't got brains enough
to fill it.

737
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:12,184
It's too bad you had to come up here
through that storm for nothing.

738
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:14,246
I haven't minded a bit...

739
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:16,948
because I came up here to fire you!

740
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:18,954
I see.

741
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:21,922
Harolday does the hiring...

742
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,497
and you do the firing.

743
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:26,798
I own the Topaz, not Harolday.

744
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,472
Now get out of here
and don't ever come back!

745
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,451
Mind if I wait for Dave?

746
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:45,211
He'll be along any minute.

747
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:50,622
Be funny if he winged
that shadow of yours.

748
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:53,629
If you mean Tala, you're loco.
He's not even up here.

749
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,691
You came up alone?

750
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:57,791
Yes.

751
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:00,630
Then who was that we took out after?

752
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:01,864
Whoever shot at you.

753
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:03,565
- Who was it?
- I don't know.

754
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,700
- You mean you won't tell.
- I mean I don't know!

755
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,212
Why should I lie to you?

756
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:54,048
Reckon you forgot something.

757
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:56,819
You just fired me.

758
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:59,425
Rock, he got away, but guess...

759
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:01,856
what.

760
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:07,533
You guess.

761
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:18,903
For a man that's got a despise for women,
you sure do get all snaggled up with them.

762
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:59,585
- You work for Harolday?
- Yes.

763
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:04,059
Here's one of his horses.
That's my saddle. I'll pick it up in a minute.

764
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,260
Howdy.

765
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:13,660
I thought I sent you up to Tabletop.

766
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:15,796
- That's right.
- What happened?

767
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,635
This, for one thing.

768
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:21,473
I told you, you should've killed him
when you had the chance.

769
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:22,704
Clews?

770
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:26,147
What's the matter?
Don't you think it was him?

771
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,676
Well, I've been figuring...

772
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:30,450
and it don't seem reasonable...

773
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,853
that Clews was in a condition
to take that sort of a chance alone.

774
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:37,359
Besides, how would he have known
I was up there that soon?

775
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:41,761
George Clews is not the only one
I've run contrariwise to in this town.

776
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:45,330
There's that shadow
of your stepdaughter's, for instance.

777
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,494
Tala?

778
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,330
Then there's... him.

779
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,877
Hello, Clint.

780
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,877
I just heard that Rocklin was...

781
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:01,879
- Was what?
- Was shot at last night.

782
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:04,317
Yeah, Mr. Rocklin
was just telling me all about it.

783
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:07,823
You haven't any idea
who might have done it, have you?

784
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:09,151
Not me.

785
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:12,091
You ain't trying to pin it on me?

786
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:15,698
Because if you are,
you're in for a big disappointment.

787
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:16,857
I was over at the Sunup...

788
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,800
playing poker with the Judge
and the boys till early morning.

789
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:21,734
If you don't believe me, ask for yourself.

790
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:23,295
I believe you.

791
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:27,840
But that don't mean you couldn't tell
a thing or two as would help...

792
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:29,242
if you wanted.

793
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:32,110
- What do you mean?
- Yeah, what would Clint know about it?

794
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:33,706
How about this?

795
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:35,546
Ever see it before?

796
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:38,481
Go on, speak up.
Did you ever see it before?

797
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:40,455
No, of course I didn't.

798
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:43,457
Quit riding me. I don't know, I tell you!

799
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:47,155
Just because I had a run-in with you
over a game of cards...

800
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:50,688
that don't mean I'd sneak up on you
in the dark and...

801
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,773
By the way...

802
00:57:58,107 --> 00:58:00,098
I was fired last night...

803
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:01,909
by the boss.

804
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:07,511
Clint, I don't know
what I'm going to do with you.

805
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,575
You cause me nothing but trouble.

806
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:12,985
The way you lied about that pouch
wouldn't have deceived a 6-year-old.

807
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:14,489
- I was...
- My advice to you...

808
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:18,391
is to get out of town for a while,
till this thing blows over.

809
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:21,363
You'll find some money in my safe
at the ranch.

810
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:25,697
Take what you need, and put the key
back in the desk drawer. Go ahead.

811
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:51,485
Mr. Rocklin, I'm so glad I found you.

812
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:54,689
I feel perfectly awful
running after you like this, but l...

813
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:56,391
You got troubles?

814
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:58,866
Come on in.

815
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:01,794
It's all right.

816
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,345
- Now, what is it?
- My aunt found out I wrote you.

817
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:12,404
She made a terrible scene.

818
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:15,849
You haven't signed everything
over to that Garvey, have you?

819
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:17,443
No, but because I refused...

820
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,284
she said she's sign an affidavit
saying I'm still underage.

821
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:22,950
And as my guardian,
she can do whatever she likes.

822
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:26,018
You got anything to prove
you're not underage?

823
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:29,664
Mr. Garvey has a letter that will prove it.

824
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:32,462
My aunt wrote it before we came out here.

825
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:34,230
You suppose we could get it?

826
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:36,295
He'd never give it to me.

827
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,839
- Wait here.
- Please, you...

828
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:45,278
You won't go getting yourself into trouble,
will you?

829
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:49,075
I mean, I'd rather give up everything
than...

830
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:13,437
That takes care of that.

831
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:15,374
All we have to do is make the affidavit...

832
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,436
and everything will be just as we want it.

833
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:20,812
I certainly hope so. Of course,
it's not myself I'm concerned about.

834
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:23,113
Of course. Now, let me see...

835
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:26,279
"I, Elizabeth..."

836
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,864
Mr. Rocklin, this is indeed a surprise.

837
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:39,163
I understood
you were riding for the Topaz.

838
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:40,702
That's right.

839
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:46,403
Miss Martin, perhaps we can finish
our business at some later date.

840
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:49,070
Would you excuse us, please?

841
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,717
I came for that letter.

842
01:00:58,021 --> 01:00:59,852
- Letter?
- The one Miss Martin wrote...

843
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:03,221
from back east,
saying the girl was of age, remember?

844
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,951
No, I don't believe I do.

845
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:18,436
Mr. Rocklin, let me ask you a question.

846
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:22,942
Just what is your interest in this letter?

847
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:25,843
My only interest is getting it.

848
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:30,676
You realize what this is, don't you?

849
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,320
It's robbery.

850
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:35,289
Armed robbery, at that.

851
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:39,860
I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed.

852
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:45,293
Yours?

853
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,002
- Open up.
- There's nothing there that concerns you.

854
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:52,906
I'd like to make up my own mind
about that.

855
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:59,041
All right, I'll open it, just to convince you
that I'm not hiding any letter.

856
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:07,887
- What's the idea?
- These cards.

857
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:12,556
Is there anything unusual about a man
having a deck of cards in his possession?

858
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:14,858
Depends on what kind they are.

859
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,593
Especially when they're under
lock and key.

860
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:20,158
- You're taking them with you, I presume.
- That's right.

861
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:23,399
- Now you look here...
- You're the one that better start looking...

862
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:25,600
for a way out for killing Red Cardell.

863
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:26,699
Red Cardell?

864
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:29,677
He found out about these
and you killed him.

865
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:32,576
And you believe a story like that?

866
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:34,980
I will till I hear a better one.

867
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:40,783
The district judge at Garden City
might be very interested in these.

868
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:20,719
Give me a hand here, boys.

869
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,794
Say, looks like you two
had a little disagreement.

870
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:29,304
- He isn't dead, is he?
- Not permanently, I don't reckon.

871
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:32,637
- What happened, anyway?
- Nothing! Nothing at all!

872
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:34,801
You must have found out something.

873
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:36,105
Come on.

874
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,348
- What's the matter? Are you hurt?
- Shut up!

875
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:49,948
Don't you talk to me like that!
I'll have you...

876
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:53,156
Find out who owns
that tobacco pouch yet?

877
01:03:53,796 --> 01:03:55,559
Nope, but get Clint Harolday.

878
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:57,997
- Clint? Is he in on it?
- I don't know, but get him.

879
01:03:58,067 --> 01:03:59,728
Bring him up to my room.

880
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:00,894
Yeah!

881
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:18,484
So now you know the truth.

882
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:22,456
Think you can steal him away from me,
you're welcome to try it.

883
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:25,783
Did you get it?

884
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,558
Nope, but I don't think it matters much.

885
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:31,464
You go on back to the KC,
and I'll come out in the morning...

886
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,525
pick you up and take you
over to Garden City.

887
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:35,127
I hate putting you to that trouble.

888
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:38,105
It's nothing at all. I'm going there anyway.

889
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,502
You look like you've been fighting.

890
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:43,545
What are you doing here?

891
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:46,247
I was just telling Miss Cardell...

892
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:49,277
about you and me.

893
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:51,650
What about you and me?

894
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,622
- I think I'd better be going.
- Just a minute.

895
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:56,817
What all has she been telling you?

896
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,554
Really, I'd rather not.

897
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:02,029
Go ahead. Tell him.
And I dare him to deny it.

898
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:03,389
Deny what?

899
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:06,401
That she was with you last night
in the cabin in the mountains.

900
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:08,266
Why should I deny it?

901
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:11,033
- Didn't you make love to me?
- Make love?

902
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,370
You didn't kiss me, I suppose.

903
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:16,300
Do you expect me to deny that, too?

904
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,142
You see?

905
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:21,750
Maybe you ought to hear
what I have to say.

906
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:23,944
Please, you needn't explain.

907
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,488
After all, it isn't any of my business, is it?

908
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:30,719
- Why, you little...
- That's right. Start swearing.

909
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:32,124
Just like a man.

910
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:35,061
If there wasn't a lady here,
I'd do more to you than swear.

911
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:39,397
Mr. Rocklin, I can't thank you enough
for trying to help me, and I...

912
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:45,363
I really appreciate it ever so much.

913
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:58,079
She's lovely, isn't she? So sweet, honest...

914
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:00,588
but helpless.

915
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:04,553
It's a pity you didn't fall in love with her
instead of me.

916
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:06,621
You might as well know right now...

917
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:10,063
that no woman is going to get me
hogtied and branded.

918
01:06:10,933 --> 01:06:12,560
Don't be so sure.

919
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,369
I don't think I'm doing so badly.

920
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:19,938
Don't you?

921
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:23,535
Don't you know?

922
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:27,839
I know there isn't anything
you wouldn't do to get what you want.

923
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:36,748
I always get what I want.

924
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:44,263
See? Bye.

925
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:33,409
Whatever is to become of you?
Have you no pride, decency?

926
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:37,084
Throwing yourself at that wretch
like any shameless hussy.

927
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:38,916
I thought we were done with him...

928
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:41,980
but, no, you had to run and tell him
all about our business.

929
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,958
Don't you dare deny it.

930
01:07:44,994 --> 01:07:49,055
You know very well you told him
about that letter I wrote to Mr. Garvey.

931
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:50,496
Didn't you?

932
01:08:20,796 --> 01:08:22,991
Tell Miss Martin
I'll take care of everything.

933
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:25,056
You'll take care of everything.

934
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:43,782
Get down. Tie them up.

935
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,626
All right.

936
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,348
Come in.

937
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:21,046
Get in. Get in.

938
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:23,017
Here he is, Rock.

939
01:09:23,626 --> 01:09:26,561
Caught him just in time near the Topaz.

940
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,897
Heading for out, I'd say. Here's his gun.

941
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:32,596
How about you going down
and having one on me?

942
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,533
Tell Cap to charge it.

943
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:37,264
Yeah.

944
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:40,300
But if you need me, holler.

945
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:44,344
What's this all about?

946
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:47,949
Now, there's no use you getting
all het up and excited, kid.

947
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:50,679
I just want to ask you a few questions.

948
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:53,316
Sit down.

949
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,439
I told you, I don't know
who owns that pouch...

950
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:21,983
and I don't know who shot at you.

951
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:25,509
Forget it. That's not what
I wanted to talk to you about anyway.

952
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:28,250
What do you want to talk about?
Come on! Get it over with!

953
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:31,623
Clint, I want you to tell me
why Garvey murdered Red Cardell.

954
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:34,288
- You know, don't you?
- Me? No.

955
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:36,524
You do, and you're
going to tell me all about it.

956
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:38,294
I don't know anything about it!

957
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:40,460
- Talk.
- I don't know anything!

958
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:45,371
I would...

959
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:14,299
Look at this. Where's Doc Riley?

960
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:18,802
What's the matter? What is it?

961
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:26,314
Somebody better fetch Harolday.

962
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:27,849
Better get Arly, too.

963
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:30,714
- She was over at the hotel.
- I'll get her.

964
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:37,892
What's going on? Gangway.
Here, what's the trouble?

965
01:11:40,429 --> 01:11:42,260
And I warned you, didn't I?

966
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:44,856
Guess that's the last trouble
you'll cause in this town.

967
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:47,629
- Hand over that gun.
- Now, just a minute.

968
01:11:47,703 --> 01:11:49,864
I know it looks bad, but I didn't kill the kid.

969
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:51,371
I believe you.

970
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,874
When I come in, his gun was laying
right over there...

971
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:56,877
No, it wasn't. It was right here in my hand,
like it is now.

972
01:11:56,945 --> 01:11:59,505
Yeah, if you didn't kill him, then who did?

973
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:01,344
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.

974
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:02,941
Where's my boy?

975
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:14,887
- I didn't do it, Harolday.
- Who did, then?

976
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:16,726
He had a gun in his hand
when we came in.

977
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:18,596
Bet it's the same one that killed Clint.

978
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:20,601
What do you say to that?

979
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:22,603
- He's right.
- You admit it.

980
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:25,003
That still doesn't say I did it.

981
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:36,245
- Why'd you do it?
- I didn't.

982
01:12:36,318 --> 01:12:38,013
He admits it was his gun that shot him.

983
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:39,384
But you didn't fire it?

984
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:40,922
That's right.

985
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:44,521
- What happened?
- Clint and I were having a little argument.

986
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:45,958
What about?

987
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:49,622
About whether he was going to help
clear up a few things...

988
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:52,963
that have been bothering me
and some other folks around here.

989
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:55,495
Who killed Red Cardell, for instance.

990
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:57,869
- Cardell?
- And the KC foreman...

991
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:01,739
and who it was took that shot at me
at Tabletop last night...

992
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:05,143
and why certain people are so anxious
to get rid of that Cardell girl.

993
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,772
How would Clint know about all that?

994
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:09,374
He's lying. He's covering up
for killing my boy.

995
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:13,581
Don't be a fool. You know you
can't get away with a yarn like that.

996
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:16,418
Why don't you save yourself
and everyone else some trouble...

997
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:18,187
and just surrender to the Sheriff here?

998
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:22,253
After all, it's not a crime in these parts
to shoot a man in self-defense.

999
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:24,458
- Self-defense?
- Yes.

1000
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:26,160
Everybody knows how Clint was.

1001
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:30,194
He probably lost his head and pulled a gun
like he did that night in the poker game.

1002
01:13:30,272 --> 01:13:31,796
Wasn't that it?

1003
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:33,771
No, that wasn't it...

1004
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:37,508
and until I do what I've got to do,
I'm not surrendering to anybody.

1005
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:40,605
I wouldn't exactly care
to be shot in the back...

1006
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:42,172
in a framed-up jailbreak.

1007
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:45,618
If someone was going to kill you,
why didn't they do it just now?

1008
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:47,484
Why'd they have to kill Clint?

1009
01:13:47,556 --> 01:13:50,821
I don't know, unless
they wanted to get Clint, too.

1010
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:53,786
See, doing it this way, they get us both.

1011
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:57,229
Clint first and me afterwards,
just like I said.

1012
01:13:57,299 --> 01:13:59,699
Quit the fancy talk. Who's they?

1013
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:01,827
I might be able to answer that
for you later.

1014
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:04,168
No, you won't, because
you're coming along with me.

1015
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:05,934
Am I? Get back.

1016
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:14,980
After him!

1017
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:39,507
Sheriff, you ought to be congratulated.

1018
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:41,440
Look, Mr. Harolday,
you seen what happened.

1019
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:43,944
Let's go to Garden City,
that's where he's headed.

1020
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:45,707
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

1021
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:47,009
Come on.

1022
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:51,819
You are crying, Arlita.
There is no need to cry.

1023
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:54,981
Rocklin did not kill your brother.
I saw it all.

1024
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,315
Then why didn't you tell?

1025
01:14:57,793 --> 01:14:58,953
Who was it?

1026
01:14:59,027 --> 01:15:01,860
You will know him
when you see me kill him.

1027
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:17,769
Want I should spell you awhile?

1028
01:15:18,914 --> 01:15:22,714
Doggone you. I might have known
you'd do something like this.

1029
01:15:27,222 --> 01:15:29,816
- What are we doing?
- Heading for the KC.

1030
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:33,328
For the KC? Isn't that
a little like hanging yourself?

1031
01:15:33,428 --> 01:15:35,896
You better get out of this country fast,
I'm thinking.

1032
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:38,091
- I'll do the thinking.
- Yeah.

1033
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:44,928
Name is Clews, ma'am.
Mr. Garvey sent us out.

1034
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:47,202
Said you were expecting trouble
with that Rocklin.

1035
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:49,437
I am. I'm wondering if you're up to it.

1036
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:51,706
I notice you didn't fare so well
with him yesterday.

1037
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:54,180
- He was drunk.
- Yeah, but I'm sober now.

1038
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:55,375
See that you stay that way.

1039
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:59,819
Don't worry, ma'am. I'm just waiting
to get even with that saddle tramp.

1040
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:01,185
We'll be close by.

1041
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:02,621
Yes, ma'am.

1042
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,859
See anybody riding hard for Garden City?

1043
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:17,531
Been on the road all night.
Ain't seen a living soul.

1044
01:16:17,606 --> 01:16:19,597
Probably took the cutoff
through Jawbone Canyon.

1045
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:21,165
After that storm, he won't make it.

1046
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,404
Only one other place he could've gone.
That's KC.

1047
01:16:23,478 --> 01:16:24,638
- You think so?
- I'm positive.

1048
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:27,705
- That's what you said before.
- To the KC, men!

1049
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:33,077
- Take me through the canyon.
- It is dangerous, Arlita.

1050
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:36,249
- We've got to beat them to the KC.
- It is dangerous.

1051
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:51,468
I will go through from here alone.

1052
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,735
We're going through together.

1053
01:17:09,191 --> 01:17:11,318
Hey, George. George, get up.

1054
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:23,000
You ungrateful thing, running away
like a deceitful sneak thief.

1055
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:25,164
Yes, I'm running away,
and it's all your fault.

1056
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:28,937
You're been deceitful and sneaking.
Don't think I don't know your intensions.

1057
01:17:29,011 --> 01:17:30,876
Don't think I don't know your intentions.

1058
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:33,813
I don't care! Nothing you can say or do
is going to stop me.

1059
01:17:33,882 --> 01:17:37,750
You little fool, you go to Garden City
with that man and you'll lose everything.

1060
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:41,311
But why? Why are you being so evasive?
If you know, why don't you tell me?

1061
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:43,381
All right, I'll tell you.

1062
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:48,128
Rocklin is the nephew
of the late Mr. Cardell.

1063
01:17:48,196 --> 01:17:50,221
As next of kin,
he stands to get everything...

1064
01:17:50,298 --> 01:17:53,392
because you're not Cardell's niece,
you're only his grandniece.

1065
01:17:53,468 --> 01:17:55,026
Rocklin turned up unexpectedly.

1066
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:57,833
- You and Mr. Garvey knew the truth?
- Yes!

1067
01:17:57,906 --> 01:18:00,466
And you knowed the truth all the time,
too, didn't you?

1068
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:02,669
No wonder you stuck around.

1069
01:18:04,713 --> 01:18:06,374
Well, of all the...

1070
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:09,848
I'll take care of her.

1071
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,748
Come on.

1072
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:30,761
I heard one of them
tell my aunt not to worry...

1073
01:18:30,839 --> 01:18:33,569
that he was just as anxious as she was
to get even with you.

1074
01:18:33,642 --> 01:18:35,473
It's the only way I can handle her.

1075
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:38,308
The Clews are around here someplace.
Garvey sent them.

1076
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:40,177
You bet we're around.

1077
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:46,145
Untie her.

1078
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:51,782
Now tie him up.

1079
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:55,661
I'll take part in this, you hairy beast.

1080
01:18:56,798 --> 01:18:59,096
And here's something I owe you.

1081
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:05,568
Help me get her on the bed.

1082
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:09,834
Take those two to Mr. Garvey,
tell him I want to see him at once.

1083
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:11,708
Put them in the wagon and get our horses.

1084
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:13,304
We'll dump him in the Judge's lap.

1085
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:16,077
- Hadn't we better tie him, too?
- Get some rope.

1086
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:47,707
Get rid of those guns.

1087
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:50,513
- What's the matter, Arly?
- Get rid of them!

1088
01:19:53,488 --> 01:19:55,046
Now get down off that wagon.

1089
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:56,522
Look, Arly...

1090
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:10,665
Better get out of here as fast as you can.
They're headed this way.

1091
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:12,766
Where'd you get this?

1092
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:15,810
That belongs to the man
that took that a shot at me on Tabletop.

1093
01:20:15,877 --> 01:20:17,367
Dave found it.

1094
01:20:20,782 --> 01:20:22,249
Cut him loose.

1095
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:24,946
Put that gun away.

1096
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:40,362
We got to stop him.
He's got to get away. Get the team!

1097
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:44,735
Rocklin, you got to get out of here!

1098
01:20:44,806 --> 01:20:47,172
Do something. If you can!

1099
01:21:00,288 --> 01:21:02,916
Doggone it, Rock! I'm on your side!

1100
01:21:02,991 --> 01:21:05,084
Then, come on. Let's get the Cardell girl.

1101
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:08,618
You haven't time. They're coming.
Don't you believe me?

1102
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,797
- Go get him.
- He's as stubborn as an old mule.

1103
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:18,431
You're putting a rope around your neck!
Mine, too, maybe.

1104
01:21:21,843 --> 01:21:23,367
Get him out of sight and follow me.

1105
01:21:24,846 --> 01:21:27,974
- What will we do with the old lady?
- Do whatever you like.

1106
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:29,949
I'd like to poison her.

1107
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:37,919
Come on.

1108
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:54,137
Howdy, ma'am. Sorry to bother you...

1109
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:56,973
Mr. Garvey, I'm so glad you're here.
The most awful...

1110
01:21:57,045 --> 01:22:00,105
- What are all those men doing here?
- We're looking for Rocklin.

1111
01:22:00,181 --> 01:22:03,207
- Has he been here?
- Yes, here and gone.

1112
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:04,411
- What?
- Gone?

1113
01:22:04,486 --> 01:22:07,512
Yes. The two men you sent took him
and that old man back to town.

1114
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:09,181
- The Clews?
- Funny, we didn't see them.

1115
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:11,748
- Something must have gone wrong.
- For once, I agree.

1116
01:22:11,826 --> 01:22:13,487
Let's fan out and see what's going on.

1117
01:22:13,561 --> 01:22:17,053
Don't leave, Mr. Garvey. I want
to talk to you privately. It's important.

1118
01:22:17,132 --> 01:22:19,430
We'd better go ahead
and meet you in town.

1119
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:22,800
Possibly that would be better.
I'll see you in town later, Sheriff.

1120
01:22:22,871 --> 01:22:25,066
- We'll leave your horse here for you.
- Thank you.

1121
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:27,005
Tie Garvey's horse up.

1122
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:38,609
You're positive he knows everything?

1123
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:41,417
Absolutely everything!
He was standing right at the window.

1124
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:42,786
If you were to ask me...

1125
01:22:42,857 --> 01:22:47,089
I'm not asking you, and stop bothering me
with your silly little questions.

1126
01:22:47,162 --> 01:22:49,130
We've got to do something else
besides talk.

1127
01:22:49,197 --> 01:22:51,893
You have to do something.
This was all your idea, remember?

1128
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:54,299
My idea? That's all you know about it.

1129
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:57,566
If there's anybody else in on it,
Judge, speak up.

1130
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:59,368
Well, I do declare!

1131
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:00,599
Talk.

1132
01:23:00,675 --> 01:23:02,336
- Why, l...
- Not you!

1133
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:06,403
You ever see this before?

1134
01:23:11,753 --> 01:23:13,243
Drop that gun!

1135
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:15,820
No, Judge.

1136
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:21,084
He was just getting ready
to finish you off through that window.

1137
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:26,562
You seem to like to do business
through windows, Harolday.

1138
01:23:26,634 --> 01:23:28,625
You didn't shoot Clint, by any chance?

1139
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:32,537
By one bad chance. Tala saw him do it,
and that pouch is his.

1140
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:36,800
Tala made it for him a long time ago
when he made his own, didn't you?

1141
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:39,073
Why did you kill Red Cardell?

1142
01:24:03,371 --> 01:24:06,101
Harolday wanted the KC
the same as he wanted the Topaz...

1143
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:08,972
and the Hardman place
for his land scheme.

1144
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:11,374
He planned on breaking up the ranches...

1145
01:24:11,446 --> 01:24:14,904
into smaller holdings
and selling them to dirt farmers.

1146
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:17,017
He pretended to be on the outs with me...

1147
01:24:17,085 --> 01:24:19,849
so that I could gain
the confidence of Cardell.

1148
01:24:19,921 --> 01:24:22,446
Then, of course, when Red caught me...

1149
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:27,057
with that deck of marked cards
and threatened to expose me...

1150
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:29,056
Harolday shot him.

1151
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:30,427
Why did he kill Clint?

1152
01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:33,592
It was an accident.
That shot was meant for you.

1153
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:36,727
You see, we knew who you were.
We even tried to locate you...

1154
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:40,241
not to inform you of your legacy,
but to eliminate you.

1155
01:24:40,341 --> 01:24:42,866
Naturally, when you arrived here in town...

1156
01:24:42,944 --> 01:24:45,777
and without any knowledge
of your relationship to Cardell...

1157
01:24:45,847 --> 01:24:48,213
it seemed you were playing
right into our hands.

1158
01:24:48,283 --> 01:24:49,807
I was hoping you'd think so.

1159
01:24:49,884 --> 01:24:52,352
Harolday intended to kill you at Tabletop.

1160
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,786
Once you were out of the way,
it was our intention...

1161
01:24:54,856 --> 01:24:57,154
to have me handle
the business affairs of the women.

1162
01:24:57,225 --> 01:24:58,624
And do us out of everything!

1163
01:24:58,693 --> 01:25:01,491
It would have been much simpler.
Everything would have been...

1164
01:25:01,563 --> 01:25:03,895
You vile, wicked, despicable...

1165
01:25:11,673 --> 01:25:14,403
When he wakes up,
we'll have to get everything put on paper.

1166
01:25:14,476 --> 01:25:18,003
And you'll have to do the putting,
because I can't write.

1167
01:25:21,816 --> 01:25:25,013
I think Auntie's out of her mind.
She's in her room laughing.

1168
01:25:25,086 --> 01:25:28,112
What that old pelican needs
is a good spanking.

1169
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:30,657
I bet you're just the one that can do it.

1170
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:32,923
Yeah, I believe I am.

1171
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:36,095
I know I am.

1172
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:43,263
I guess there's no hurry
for you to get to Garden City now.

1173
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:44,600
No, I...

1174
01:25:45,206 --> 01:25:47,834
I don't suppose there's any rush.

1175
01:25:52,881 --> 01:25:55,645
If I were like her, I'd stay in the west.

1176
01:25:56,851 --> 01:25:59,843
Does that mean you're going back east,
Cousin Clara?

1177
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:02,515
It's where I belong. I know that now.

1178
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:07,026
I reckon it's good to know
where you belong.

1179
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:09,395
Wish I knew.

1180
01:26:10,532 --> 01:26:12,056
I can tell you.

1181
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:26,912
Hey, Rock!

1182
01:26:26,981 --> 01:26:28,744
Rock, where are you?

1183
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,549
English
