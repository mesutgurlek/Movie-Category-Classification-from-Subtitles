1
00:00:24,074 --> 00:00:29,842
# Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you #

2
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:34,942
# Happy birthday,
dear Sissy... #

3
00:00:34,984 --> 00:00:38,181
The surprise
of Sissy Hankshaw

4
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:41,054
is that she did not grow up
a neurotic disaster.

5
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:44,185
If you were a small girl
in a low-income suburb

6
00:00:44,227 --> 00:00:47,424
of Richmond, Virginia,
as Sissy was,

7
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,432
and your own daddy
sometimes makes jokes

8
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,094
about you being
"all thumbs,"

9
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,161
then you toughen up...
or you shatter.

10
00:00:55,205 --> 00:01:00,905
# ...Happy birthday
to you. #

11
00:01:00,944 --> 00:01:02,639
Oh yes!

12
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:07,480
Oh, did you make a wish?

13
00:01:07,517 --> 00:01:10,645
No, and I'm afraid she ain't gonna
make much of a brain surgeon, neither.

14
00:01:10,687 --> 00:01:12,416
Hey, she could
be a butcher.

15
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:16,118
She could retire in two years
on the overcharges alone.

16
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,459
She might make a hell
of a hitchhiker. Ha ha ha ha ha.

17
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,795
If she were a boy,
you mean.

18
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,926
She is,
if I may speak frankly,

19
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:28,631
somewhat
of a medical oddity.

20
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,333
Well, the Lord made them things
big for a purpose.

21
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:32,773
Although...

22
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:35,141
Lord only knows
what that might be.

23
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:38,745
Doc, oh Doc...

24
00:01:38,782 --> 00:01:42,183
if a young man
ever shows up here

25
00:01:42,218 --> 00:01:45,346
with ugly fingers...

26
00:01:45,388 --> 00:01:48,789
you know,
would you please...

27
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:53,558
Dear lady, please remember the words
of the painter Paul Gauguin

28
00:01:53,596 --> 00:01:56,497
who said,
"The ugly may be beautiful...

29
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,001
but the pretty, never."

30
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,263
I don't suppose that means
very much to you.

31
00:02:03,306 --> 00:02:06,298
I'm not stupid.

32
00:02:06,342 --> 00:02:08,401
There's nothing about your past,
present or future...

33
00:02:08,444 --> 00:02:10,412
that your hands
do not know.

34
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:12,505
And there is nothing
about your hands

35
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,710
that Madame Zoe
does not know.

36
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:17,879
I, Madame Zoe...

37
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:20,185
er...
Jesus-fucking-Christ!

38
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,259
Husband...

39
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:26,126
is she gonna find
a husband?

40
00:02:26,162 --> 00:02:28,426
Oh...

41
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:37,400
I see men in your life.

42
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,498
Oh...

43
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,907
I also see women.

44
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:46,671
Lots and lots
and lots of women.

45
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:48,673
Oh...

46
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,883
let's get out of here.

47
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,094
The gods did not choose
Sissy Hankshaw

48
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:02,097
for her thumbs per se,

49
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:04,258
but rather for the use
that she would make of them.

50
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,758
Hitchhiking would become
her customary mode of travel.

51
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:11,638
Hitchhiking would become,
in fact, her way of life...

52
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:14,905
a calling to which
she was literally born.

53
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,242
"Greater freedom
of movement."

54
00:03:48,244 --> 00:03:54,205
# In perfect dreams #

55
00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:01,747
# Love has no extremes #

56
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,351
# All the world can be #

57
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:12,460
# Endlessly
in perfect dreams #

58
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:22,135
# In perfect dreams #

59
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:29,141
# You can fly, it seems #

60
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:32,484
# Sailing nakedly #

61
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:39,553
# Weightlessly,
in perfect dreams #

62
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:46,094
# Dream... #

63
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:50,731
# Have a rendezvous #

64
00:04:50,773 --> 00:04:53,537
# A fling... #

65
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:57,478
# Or two #

66
00:04:57,513 --> 00:05:00,107
# Dream... #

67
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:04,245
# And I promise you #

68
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:11,125
# It all rings true #

69
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:17,360
# In perfect dreams #

70
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:24,397
# Life is quite serene #

71
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,375
# You and I could be #

72
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:35,112
# Happily
in perfect dreams #

73
00:05:39,055 --> 00:05:43,719
# Dreams... #

74
00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:49,158
# Dreams... #

75
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,555
"Sissy, precious being,

76
00:06:51,594 --> 00:06:54,620
how are you,
my extraordinary one?

77
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:58,225
Next time you're near
Manhattan, do ring me up.

78
00:06:58,267 --> 00:07:03,398
There is a man to whom
I simply must introduce you..."

79
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:08,874
- Crimeny.
- "Thrill! The Countess."

80
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:04,193
# Moving #

81
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,862
# Give me motion #

82
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:12,603
# Grooving #

83
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:16,043
# On a notion #

84
00:08:17,947 --> 00:08:20,711
# Ooh... #

85
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,618
# Ooh ooh-ooh... #

86
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:01,880
Goin' north?

87
00:09:07,496 --> 00:09:10,693
- You want some?
- Thanks.

88
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,104
American cheese.

89
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,299
It's the king of road food.

90
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,973
You in show business?

91
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:29,917
- I was a successful model once.
- For magazines?

92
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:32,819
I was the "Yoni Yum
Feminine Hygiene Dew" girl

93
00:09:32,855 --> 00:09:36,757
from 1965 to 1970,
and then I got laid off.

94
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:38,919
- So now you're bumming around?
- Yeah.

95
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:40,986
Hitchhiking?

96
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,998
Please don't think me
immodest...

97
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:45,296
but I'm really the best.

98
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,632
- You're the best?
- Yeah.

99
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:51,665
I am.

100
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:57,145
When I was younger, I hitchhiked
127 hours without stopping.

101
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,647
I crossed the continent
twice in six days,

102
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,513
cooled my thumbs
in both oceans,

103
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,417
and caught rides after midnight
on unlighted highways.

104
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:06,546
When I'm really moving...

105
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:09,581
moving so freely,
so clearly, so delicately

106
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,651
that even the sex maniacs
and the cops

107
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,856
can only blink
and let me pass...

108
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:19,095
then I embody the spirit
and the heart of hitchhiking.

109
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,798
I have the rhythms
of the universe inside me.

110
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:27,298
I'm in a state of grace.

111
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:37,650
Well, right off...

112
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:41,589
I don't remember how old I was
when I found out I was part Indian.

113
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:46,527
My mama's family, a lot of them
had lived out west in the Dakotas.

114
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:50,191
One of them had married a squaw,
Siwash tribe.

115
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:53,690
You may say
that my pleasure in Indianhood

116
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,103
and my passion for car travel
might be incongruous...

117
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,130
if not mutually exclusive...

118
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:03,839
but after all, first car
that ever stopped for me

119
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:07,474
had been named in honor
of the great chief of the Ottawa.

120
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,079
New York City.

121
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,225
Sure is a hell of a town.

122
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:28,226
Ominous.

123
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:41,141
...gold or silver beads, she has...
- Ah!

124
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,477
Sit down, dear,
do sit down.

125
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:51,355
Take a load off
those lovely tootsies.

126
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:53,988
Would you fancy
some sherry?

127
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:57,897
Shit, oh goodness,
I'm all out of sherry.

128
00:11:57,933 --> 00:12:01,232
How about
some red Ripple?

129
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,397
You know what red Ripple is,
don't you?

130
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:05,600
Fruit punch
with a hard-on.

131
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,438
To my own
special Sissy.

132
00:12:12,214 --> 00:12:14,512
So my letter
brought you flying, huh?

133
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:17,486
Now where were you?

134
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,579
Salt Lake City?
LaConner?

135
00:12:19,622 --> 00:12:22,955
I may have
a little surprise for you.

136
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,153
But first tell me
about yourself.

137
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:28,994
It's been six months, hasn't it?
In some circles, that is half a year.

138
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:31,829
- How are you?
- Tired.

139
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:33,926
That is the very first time

140
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:35,994
in the eons
that I have known you

141
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:38,006
that I have ever
heard you complain,

142
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,065
and now you're tired,
poor darling.

143
00:12:40,109 --> 00:12:42,942
"Born freak
can only go uphill."

144
00:12:42,978 --> 00:12:44,502
Freak shmeak!

145
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:46,981
All of us are freaks
in one way or another.

146
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,348
Try being born
a male Russian countess

147
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:51,353
into a white, middle-class

148
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:54,618
Baptist family in Mississippi
and you'll see what I mean.

149
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:56,955
Well, I've always been proud
of the way nature singled me out.

150
00:12:56,992 --> 00:13:00,860
It's the people who have been
deformed by society I feel sorry for.

151
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:04,127
I've been steady moving
for 11 years and some months.

152
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:07,135
I think I should rest up
for a spell.

153
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:09,660
I'm not as young
as I used to be.

154
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,299
Shit, oh goodness!
You won't be 30 for another year

155
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:14,172
and you're more
beautiful than ever.

156
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,770
Does that mean you have
an assignment for me?

157
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,350
You were
the Yoni Yum girl

158
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,751
from... let's see...

159
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:29,053
1965...

160
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:32,083
through 1970.

161
00:13:33,195 --> 00:13:36,460
And you always
smelled so nice...

162
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:38,899
like a little sister.

163
00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:41,164
I loathe the stink
of females.

164
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:43,433
They're so sweet
the way god made them.

165
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:45,565
Then they start
fooling around with men

166
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:48,270
and soon they're stinking
like rotten mushrooms...

167
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,143
like an excessively
chlorinated swimming pool,

168
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,707
like a tuna fish's ree-tirement party.
They all stink...

169
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:59,278
from the Queen of England
to Bonanza Jellybean... they stink!

170
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:02,085
- Bonanza Jellybean?
- What?

171
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:05,150
Oh...

172
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:08,721
Jellybean...

173
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,164
Well, she's a young thing
who works on my ranch.

174
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,328
Anyway, my dear,
I am getting out of photography now

175
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,962
and into watercolors.

176
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:20,567
The exact man
that I have wanted you to meet,

177
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,772
is my artist,
the watercolorist.

178
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:25,780
- But Countess...
- No, no, no.

179
00:14:25,814 --> 00:14:29,147
Don't get agitated. I realize
that you have always avoided

180
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:31,652
all but the most rudimentary
involvements with men

181
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:34,713
and I might add,
you have been right.

182
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:36,884
But what I am getting at,
is there comes a time

183
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:40,418
when it is psychologically impossible
for a woman to lose her virginity.

184
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,158
She can't wait too long,
you know?

185
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,497
Now I'm not saying
that you must lose yours,

186
00:14:46,535 --> 00:14:50,164
but uh... just ponder it a bit,
that's all.

187
00:14:50,205 --> 00:14:52,901
Well, what makes you think
this watercolorist and I

188
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:55,035
would develop
a romantic relationship?

189
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:57,068
I can't be sure that it would,

190
00:14:57,112 --> 00:14:59,580
but what have you
got to lose?

191
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,012
Well, okay, I'll try it...

192
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:07,420
for you.
It seems kind of silly, though...

193
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:10,482
me goin' out with an artist
in New York City.

194
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:12,255
Oh good, good,
good, good!

195
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:13,761
You'll enjoy it,
you'll see.

196
00:15:13,796 --> 00:15:16,162
Julian is a gentleman.

197
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,362
And by the way, Sissy,

198
00:15:20,402 --> 00:15:24,338
he is a
full-blooded Indian.

199
00:15:40,222 --> 00:15:42,383
Hi.

200
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:53,902
Julian?
Are you okay?

201
00:15:53,936 --> 00:15:55,904
This is bad.
We better get him home.

202
00:15:55,938 --> 00:15:58,338
He has asthma.
Take him home, he'll be fine.

203
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,365
- You come with us.
- Yeah.

204
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:03,344
- The cigarette is not helping.
- I beg your pardon.

205
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,244
Hold up.

206
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,181
I've been enthralled
with your photographs for years.

207
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,675
When the Countess said
that you might like to meet me,

208
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,712
he never explained why.

209
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:17,783
I was ready to paint...
for free.

210
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:22,157
And now I had
to go and spoil it.

211
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:25,189
Let's talk
back at your house.

212
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,964
Come on, honey. It's gonna be fine.
We're going home.

213
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:38,379
- Oh God, this is dreadful!
- It's not your fault.

214
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,383
You know, asthma attacks
are brought on by emotional stress.

215
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,386
Poor Julian he
is just so high-strung.

216
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,388
The excitement
of meeting you

217
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,390
must have upset
his chemical balance or something,

218
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,450
because, my dear,
you are so stunning.

219
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:53,518
Don't be afraid of us,
Sissy.

220
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:56,588
- Come on.
- Oh, I've never ridden in a cab before.

221
00:16:56,632 --> 00:16:59,624
The whole idea
of paying for a ride

222
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:01,636
just makes
my thumbs hurt.

223
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,638
That is so interesting,
but don't worry, dear.

224
00:17:03,672 --> 00:17:06,971
It's not nearly as bad
as it sounds.

225
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:09,534
Just take a nice seat
in the back.

226
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:19,813
...what I was saying,
no, she has a style.

227
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,320
"Crazy Guggenheim"
has more style.

228
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,225
I'm saying...

229
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:35,566
Ooh...

230
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:37,868
Lay him out on the couch.
I'll be right back.

231
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,578
Keep the airways open
is what I know.

232
00:17:47,616 --> 00:17:49,914
- What do you mean?
- Keep the airways... this...

233
00:17:53,922 --> 00:17:57,414
Just take a nice seat, honey.
Take a seat.

234
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:02,887
- Is this right?
- That's fine, that's fine.

235
00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:06,425
You want a drink?

236
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:14,432
- Hey! You want a drink?
- Thank you.

237
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:18,435
There, that ought to beat them
bronchial buggers into submission.

238
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:21,378
I was a medic in the army.

239
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,180
Thank you.

240
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:27,313
I really should have gone into
medicine instead of publishing.

241
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,881
Sometimes though...

242
00:18:29,925 --> 00:18:33,656
I think pushing books
is a lot like pushing medicine.

243
00:18:36,064 --> 00:18:38,624
Think of books as pills.

244
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:40,828
And I have pills
to cure ignorance,

245
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,235
pills to cure boredom...

246
00:18:43,272 --> 00:18:45,467
pills to elevate moods,

247
00:18:45,507 --> 00:18:49,307
and pills to open people's eyes
to the awful truth.

248
00:18:49,344 --> 00:18:52,472
Too bad they don't have a pill
for bullshit, is what I say.

249
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,917
So, where do you live,
Ms. Hankshaw?

250
00:18:57,953 --> 00:19:00,148
I'm staying
with the Countess.

251
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:04,617
I know.

252
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:12,994
But uh... where do you live
when... you're not in New York?

253
00:19:13,035 --> 00:19:17,597
- I don't.
- You don't?

254
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:20,767
I mean, I don't live
anywhere in particular.

255
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:22,800
I just keep movin'.

256
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:25,840
Hmm...

257
00:19:28,317 --> 00:19:30,808
the traveler, eh?

258
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:32,480
Well, you might
call it that...

259
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:34,489
but I don't really
think of it as traveling.

260
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:37,890
Well, what do you
"think of it" as, then?

261
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,121
Movin'.

262
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,730
Oh...

263
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:47,301
How unusual.

264
00:19:49,504 --> 00:19:50,835
Hmm...

265
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:53,706
Well, Rupert, before
you get too engaged

266
00:19:53,742 --> 00:19:57,200
in your research on scotch
as a cure for aging,

267
00:19:57,246 --> 00:19:59,271
are you
gonna call Elaine

268
00:19:59,314 --> 00:20:01,680
and cancel our
reservations, or shall I?

269
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:04,652
What would we do without our little
efficiency expert, Carla, huh?

270
00:20:04,686 --> 00:20:06,813
Without her the whole world
would just go to hell.

271
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:10,018
She's gonna be running
for mayor next year, you know.

272
00:20:10,058 --> 00:20:14,358
Hey, Rupert...
Rupert!

273
00:20:14,396 --> 00:20:17,797
Up yours...
"Herr doktor book salesman."

274
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:21,166
Will the demands of your
"medical profession"

275
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:23,171
allow you to cancel
or shall I?

276
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:27,198
- Oh let me do it!
- Oh, so the girl has to do it?

277
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:32,211
The girl's gonna do it.
You're not gonna do it.

278
00:20:49,264 --> 00:20:51,198
Where are the others?

279
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:55,636
Rupert and Carla
had a little hassle and went home.

280
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,807
Julian fell asleep.

281
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:03,140
We covered him up.

282
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,204
We thought we should
make you comfortable too.

283
00:21:06,248 --> 00:21:08,216
Yes, thanks.

284
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,844
Oh... mine...

285
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:14,378
mine are fuller, but yours
are more perfectly shaped.

286
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:18,519
Highly...
highly debatable.

287
00:21:20,262 --> 00:21:24,562
I'll wager they're
the exact same size.

288
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,032
Hmm...

289
00:21:28,603 --> 00:21:31,197
yours are large, Marie,

290
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:35,608
but Ms. Hankshaw's...
Sissy's are more firm.

291
00:21:35,644 --> 00:21:38,943
You'd think they would have
started to droop,

292
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:41,074
I mean, from not
wearing a bra.

293
00:21:41,116 --> 00:21:43,744
Howard, watch your manners.

294
00:21:43,785 --> 00:21:45,548
You're embarrassing her.

295
00:21:45,587 --> 00:21:48,488
Here, Sissy,
let me compare.

296
00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:57,295
This is a finer place
than the place I live.

297
00:22:16,184 --> 00:22:18,652
Oh, Howard!

298
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:23,016
Sissy...

299
00:22:23,058 --> 00:22:26,494
- What are you doing?
- Getting dressed.

300
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:29,053
But... but I don't
want you to go.

301
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,031
Please, stay.
I...

302
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:33,159
l... ahem...
we can go to dinner.

303
00:22:33,201 --> 00:22:35,795
I owe you a dinner and,
and later...

304
00:22:35,837 --> 00:22:39,136
- Julian, I have to go.
- Why? Why do you have to go?

305
00:22:39,174 --> 00:22:41,404
My thumbs hurt.

306
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,742
I've made a mistake.
I've been negligent.

307
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,375
I have to hitchhike a little bit
every day no matter what,

308
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:51,580
or my thumbs,
they get stiff and sore.

309
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,145
I have to go, Julian.

310
00:23:09,104 --> 00:23:11,766
Sissy had crossed
the continent 400 times

311
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,934
and passed everybody twice...

312
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,909
but she had never
seen anything

313
00:23:15,944 --> 00:23:18,674
like what she had just
witnessed in Julian's apartment.

314
00:23:18,713 --> 00:23:21,614
Turning to the Countess'
for an explanation,

315
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,517
she received instead,
another surprise.

316
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,488
Sissy...

317
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:31,288
Sissy, you can desist
from wearing paths

318
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,191
in those
forgotten highways.

319
00:23:33,228 --> 00:23:36,095
The Countess
has arranged a job for you.

320
00:23:36,131 --> 00:23:38,258
And what a job.

321
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,665
A job for me?

322
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:43,068
I am once more about
to make advertising history.

323
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:46,131
And only you, the original
Yoni Yum Dew girl

324
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,142
could possibly assist me.

325
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,805
"The Food and Drug Administration
said Wednesday,

326
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:55,840
female deodorant sprays
may cause such harmful reactions

327
00:23:55,884 --> 00:23:58,978
as blisters,
burns, and rashes.

328
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,887
Although FDA judges
that the reported reactions

329
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:03,891
are not sufficient
to j-justify

330
00:24:03,925 --> 00:24:06,519
removal of these pr-products
from the market,

331
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:08,529
they are sufficient
to warrant

332
00:24:08,563 --> 00:24:12,727
the proposed mandatory
label warnings."

333
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:14,792
Shit, oh dear, it's enough
to make me asthmatic.

334
00:24:14,836 --> 00:24:18,363
The nerve of those twits.
What do they know about female odor?

335
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:20,670
Don't interrupt...

336
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,439
here's my concept.

337
00:24:23,478 --> 00:24:26,140
My little ranch out west,

338
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:28,741
it's a beauty ranch.

339
00:24:28,783 --> 00:24:30,751
Well, it has a few head
of cattle

340
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:32,218
for atmosphere
and tax purposes...

341
00:24:32,254 --> 00:24:35,121
but it is
a beauty ranch...

342
00:24:35,157 --> 00:24:39,491
a place where unhappy women,
divorcees, and widows mostly

343
00:24:39,528 --> 00:24:42,122
can go to lose weight,

344
00:24:42,164 --> 00:24:44,530
uh, remove wrinkles,
or change their hairstyle

345
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,797
and pretty themselves up
for the next disappointment.

346
00:24:47,836 --> 00:24:51,328
My ranch is called
"The Rubber Rose,"

347
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,273
after the "Rubber Rose"
douche bag.

348
00:24:53,308 --> 00:24:56,209
My own invention and,
bless its little red bladder,

349
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,644
is the most popular
douche bag in the world.

350
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,308
So, get this.

351
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:05,786
It is on the migratory flight path
of the whooping crane.

352
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:10,587
The last flock of wild
whooping cranes left in existence.

353
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:13,185
Whooping cranes,
in case you didn't know it,

354
00:25:13,228 --> 00:25:16,129
are noted for their
mating dance.

355
00:25:16,164 --> 00:25:19,156
Now picture these birds

356
00:25:19,201 --> 00:25:22,102
doing their sex dance on TV...

357
00:25:22,137 --> 00:25:24,162
right there
on the home screen...

358
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:27,539
creation's most elaborate
sex ritual,

359
00:25:27,576 --> 00:25:31,535
but clean and pure enough
to suit the Pope...

360
00:25:33,415 --> 00:25:37,852
with lovely Sissy Hankshaw
in the foreground...

361
00:25:37,886 --> 00:25:40,116
her white gown,
red hood attached,

362
00:25:40,155 --> 00:25:43,386
big, feathery sleeves,
trimmed in black.

363
00:25:43,425 --> 00:25:45,393
And then,

364
00:25:45,427 --> 00:25:49,625
in a very subdued imitation
of the female whooping crane,

365
00:25:49,664 --> 00:25:53,998
she dance-walks
over to a large nest

366
00:25:54,035 --> 00:25:56,026
where there sits...

367
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,071
a can of Yoni Yum
and a can of Dew!

368
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:04,408
Oh my very
goodness gracious!

369
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:07,108
Grandiose, lyrical,

370
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,139
erotic...

371
00:26:09,184 --> 00:26:12,119
and Girl Scout-oriented.
You can't top it.

372
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:24,162
So the Countess
dispatched Sissy out west

373
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:26,565
for her first
modeling assignment in years,

374
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:29,069
but not before warning her
to keep her distance

375
00:26:29,104 --> 00:26:31,072
from those nasty
and uppity cowgirls

376
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:33,097
who worked
his so-called ranch.

377
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:35,109
He also insisted

378
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:37,703
that she avoid any contact
with the alleged holy man

379
00:26:37,746 --> 00:26:39,873
who lived on the ridge
above the Rubber Rose,

380
00:26:39,914 --> 00:26:43,611
known as "The Chink," though
apparently he was Japanese-American.

381
00:26:43,652 --> 00:26:47,588
He appeared to be one of those
berry-picking moon-howlers.

382
00:26:47,622 --> 00:26:50,989
The kind of old kumquat
who might fuck a snake

383
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,756
and then write
a little poem about it.

384
00:27:01,236 --> 00:27:05,172
# I long to be lifted... #

385
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:11,745
# I long to be lifted #

386
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:19,913
# Lifted high... #

387
00:27:19,954 --> 00:27:22,548
So we take in
the good energies.

388
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:25,491
Taking in, we turn.

389
00:27:25,527 --> 00:27:27,722
And we give them out.

390
00:27:27,762 --> 00:27:32,096
And take in
and take out good things.

391
00:27:36,037 --> 00:27:38,904
You feel that?
Good, huh?

392
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:45,704
# I long to be carried #

393
00:27:49,684 --> 00:27:52,881
# I long to be carried #

394
00:27:57,625 --> 00:28:01,686
# Carried by... #

395
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:07,699
# Carried by... #

396
00:28:09,471 --> 00:28:13,100
I've traveled through the Yucatan
with the circus,

397
00:28:13,141 --> 00:28:17,441
popping false eyelashes
off a trained monkey with my bullwhip,

398
00:28:18,913 --> 00:28:22,246
when one night I ate peyote
and had a vision.

399
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:27,152
Niwetúkame,
the mother goddess...

400
00:28:27,188 --> 00:28:29,588
came to me
on the back of a doe,

401
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:32,491
with hummingbirds sipping
the tears she was shedding,

402
00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:36,861
crying, "Delores...

403
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:40,834
you must lead my daughters
against their natural enemy.

404
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:43,497
You must come
to the Rubber Rose Ranch

405
00:28:43,538 --> 00:28:45,904
and prepare
for your mission...

406
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:51,573
the details of which will be
revealed to you in a third vision."

407
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:55,880
Whoo!

408
00:29:07,896 --> 00:29:09,864
Usually she preferred
to hitchhike

409
00:29:09,898 --> 00:29:11,923
without a fixed destination...

410
00:29:11,966 --> 00:29:13,934
hitching
for hitching's sake...

411
00:29:13,968 --> 00:29:16,835
for freedom and movement
and that alone.

412
00:29:16,871 --> 00:29:19,635
But something was pulling her
to the Rubber Rose,

413
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:23,770
something softer than money
and stranger than work.

414
00:29:25,213 --> 00:29:27,443
Someday...

415
00:29:27,482 --> 00:29:29,814
if that Sissy Hankshaw
ever shows up here,

416
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:33,082
I'm gonna teach her
how to hypnotize a chicken.

417
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:38,049
Did you know chickens are the easiest
critters on earth to hypnotize?

418
00:29:38,092 --> 00:29:40,424
You just twirl a chicken
in the air 20 times,

419
00:29:40,462 --> 00:29:42,589
it's yours forever.

420
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,428
How exciting.

421
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,179
Are you a pilgrim?

422
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,451
No, I'm more
of an Indian.

423
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,549
l... I think she means are you
gonna go see "The Chink"?

424
00:30:10,592 --> 00:30:12,492
Well, I may,
and I may not.

425
00:30:12,527 --> 00:30:16,019
But seeing him's
not my main objective here.

426
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,397
You know, th-that's good 'cause,
you know, he... he might not see you.

427
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:21,493
I mean, we drove all the way
from Minneapolis

428
00:30:21,536 --> 00:30:23,697
and the crazy bastard
tried to stone us to death.

429
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:27,003
Yeah, it bummed me out.
I thought he was a master,

430
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:29,441
but he's nothing
but a dirty old mountain man.

431
00:30:29,477 --> 00:30:33,607
He took out his wanker
and shook it at Barbara.

432
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:36,674
I mean, I wouldn't go up there
if I were you.

433
00:30:36,718 --> 00:30:39,710
I wouldn't, okay?
Bye-bye.

434
00:30:41,322 --> 00:30:43,620
It was like
showering rocks...

435
00:30:45,193 --> 00:30:47,923
I had a vision that it
hit me in the head.

436
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,238
By any chance,
are you Sissy Hankshaw?

437
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,305
Yes, I am.

438
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,876
Well, my goodness,
why didn't you telephone?

439
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,820
Someone would have driven
into Sisters to pick you up.

440
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,153
I'm Miss Adrian
from the ranch.

441
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,955
The Countess wrote me
that I should expect you.

442
00:32:25,994 --> 00:32:28,462
Oh, get in.
You must be exhausted.

443
00:32:28,496 --> 00:32:32,364
Uh, Donna, help
Ms. Hankshaw with her...

444
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,800
...with her luggage.

445
00:32:43,911 --> 00:32:46,607
Twit.
You really ought to have phoned.

446
00:32:46,648 --> 00:32:48,548
We were just in Sisters

447
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:51,552
escorting some guests
to the afternoon train.

448
00:32:51,586 --> 00:32:54,316
More guests leaving
ahead of schedule.

449
00:32:54,355 --> 00:32:56,653
Three checked out today.

450
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:58,659
They decided to transfer

451
00:32:58,693 --> 00:33:02,459
to Elizabeth Arden's Main Chance Spa
in Phoenix, Arizona.

452
00:33:04,032 --> 00:33:09,163
It costs $250 a week more
than at the Rubber Rose.

453
00:33:09,203 --> 00:33:13,401
So, why are our guests leaving
and going to Elizabeth Arden's?

454
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:16,137
I'll tell you why.

455
00:33:16,177 --> 00:33:18,873
It's that plague of cowgirls.

456
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,881
I'd like to complain.

457
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:25,011
Some of you cowgirls have been
sleeping two to a bunk again

458
00:33:25,053 --> 00:33:28,819
in violation of the agreement
that "crimes against nature,"

459
00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:31,347
are to be kept confined
to the hayloft.

460
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,360
Yeah.

461
00:33:33,394 --> 00:33:36,989
Well, I don't care who sleeps with who
or where or how.

462
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:39,864
But the moaners and the groaners
and the screamers

463
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:41,766
ought to turn down
their volume

464
00:33:41,803 --> 00:33:43,395
'cause some of us
are trying to sleep...

465
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,668
or meditate.

466
00:33:45,707 --> 00:33:47,675
I'd like to complain
about the food here.

467
00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:51,042
It's rotten to the core.

468
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:53,206
Hallelujah, sister.

469
00:33:53,247 --> 00:33:56,808
They've gradually infiltrated
every sector of our program.

470
00:33:56,851 --> 00:33:58,876
The one named Debbie...

471
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,720
she considers herself an expert
on diet and exercising.

472
00:34:02,757 --> 00:34:04,315
The ball...

473
00:34:04,358 --> 00:34:06,952
with Bonanza Jellybean's
permission

474
00:34:06,994 --> 00:34:09,053
- And against my explicit orders...
- Someday...

475
00:34:09,097 --> 00:34:11,258
she's been coercing
the guests

476
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,494
into trying something
called Kundalini yoga.

477
00:34:13,534 --> 00:34:15,399
Do you know
what that is?

478
00:34:15,436 --> 00:34:18,530
It's trying
to mentally force

479
00:34:18,573 --> 00:34:22,304
a serpent of fire
to crawl up your spinal column.

480
00:34:22,343 --> 00:34:23,708
Humph.

481
00:34:23,745 --> 00:34:26,839
Oh, and there's
a new one.

482
00:34:26,881 --> 00:34:29,577
The one called
"del Ruby."

483
00:34:29,617 --> 00:34:32,848
- She has the goodwill of a scorpion.
- Whoa!

484
00:34:32,887 --> 00:34:36,516
The little barbarians are destroying
everything I've built,

485
00:34:36,557 --> 00:34:39,219
mocking all that the company
stands for.

486
00:34:47,702 --> 00:34:51,934
But now that the season
is practically over...

487
00:34:51,973 --> 00:34:54,635
we operate
April through September...

488
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:58,543
and the Countess
is finally coming...

489
00:34:59,614 --> 00:35:02,242
I'll get those
little peckers.

490
00:35:04,418 --> 00:35:07,717
Our ranch has all the latest
in modern facilities.

491
00:35:07,755 --> 00:35:12,590
Guests can relax on our veranda
or swim in our pool,

492
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:16,563
all in view of spectacular
Siwash Ridge.

493
00:35:16,597 --> 00:35:18,588
At the Rubber Rose Ranch,

494
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:22,694
we prepare more than 850
lo-cal meals per day.

495
00:35:22,737 --> 00:35:24,967
Your attention...

496
00:35:25,006 --> 00:35:26,906
We have a facial wing

497
00:35:26,941 --> 00:35:29,774
and next to that
is the hair barn.

498
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:35,709
We have 15 hair experts
from all over the world.

499
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:39,447
Up there is where
the fanny flab flies off

500
00:35:39,487 --> 00:35:44,220
at the rate of about
675 pounds a day.

501
00:35:44,258 --> 00:35:46,954
That's a lot
of salted ham, Sissy.

502
00:35:46,994 --> 00:35:50,293
- Wow, you're gonna make a movie.
- Hey, give me that!

503
00:35:50,331 --> 00:35:52,458
Ladies, as most of you
have been informed,

504
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,958
one of the fringe benefits of your stay
here at the Rubber Rose Ranch

505
00:35:56,003 --> 00:35:58,528
is a rare opportunity
to get a look at the world's

506
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,098
last surviving flock
of wild whooping cranes.

507
00:36:01,142 --> 00:36:03,406
They stop off here
twice a year

508
00:36:03,444 --> 00:36:06,072
at that marshy little lake
on the north end of the ranch

509
00:36:06,113 --> 00:36:08,047
and you're in luck
because even as I speak,

510
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,606
the flock's
over there right now.

511
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:12,483
Our special guest
Ms. Sissy H...

512
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,455
uh, Ms. Sissy Hankshaw
is with us.

513
00:36:19,727 --> 00:36:22,594
Merciful Jesus,
they're murdering the guests!

514
00:36:24,532 --> 00:36:27,558
Es gibt soviele verschiedene farben
von erdäpfel hier in Amerika,

515
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,002
in Deutschland
gibts nur eine sorte.

516
00:36:30,037 --> 00:36:31,299
Ja, ja, ja.

517
00:36:31,339 --> 00:36:34,137
Where are the guests?
Where are the guests?

518
00:36:34,175 --> 00:36:37,269
Take it easy, lady. They just rode
over the hill with the cowgirls.

519
00:36:37,311 --> 00:36:40,303
You're Miss Adrian.
We gotta talk about that filming.

520
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:41,679
Not now, you fool,
not now.

521
00:36:41,716 --> 00:36:45,174
Those crazed bitches
have led innocent women out

522
00:36:45,219 --> 00:36:47,483
and are slaughtering them
at this moment.

523
00:36:47,521 --> 00:36:49,716
We'll all be killed.

524
00:36:49,757 --> 00:36:51,884
Oh...

525
00:36:51,926 --> 00:36:53,826
there's a slaughter
going on, all right,

526
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:56,523
but it ain't the fat ladies
that are getting it.

527
00:36:56,564 --> 00:36:58,555
Your hired hands
are killing the cattle.

528
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:01,830
The cattle?
They're killing the cows?

529
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:03,234
That's what they said,
Miss Adrian.

530
00:37:03,271 --> 00:37:06,172
How dare you slaughter
the Countess' cattle?

531
00:37:06,207 --> 00:37:08,072
What's a ranch
without cows?

532
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:09,940
We're replacing them
with goats.

533
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,968
The cows are diseased
and in pain.

534
00:37:12,013 --> 00:37:14,607
We're just putting them
out of their misery.

535
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,948
According to
Ms. Bonanza Jellybean,

536
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:21,284
the Rubber Rose is indicative
of the Countess' values.

537
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:25,122
They purchased a cheap but weak
strain of cattle in the beginning,

538
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,854
- And within...
- Oh heavens.

539
00:37:26,894 --> 00:37:30,022
I don't want to hear what Bonanza
Jellybean tells all you girls.

540
00:37:30,064 --> 00:37:33,966
Come on, Sissy.
I'll show you to your quarters.

541
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:37,027
Hören sie, wir müssen
über diesen film sprechen.

542
00:37:37,071 --> 00:37:38,834
Es ist sehr wichtig.
Ich meine,

543
00:37:38,873 --> 00:37:41,740
warum bin ich so weit
hier angereist, ja?

544
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,647
Excuse me, miss.

545
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,778
Would you care
for your breakfast now?

546
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,311
I feel a bit hungry.

547
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,660
Okay.

548
00:38:02,096 --> 00:38:06,328
Road food!
How did you know?

549
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:10,235
Well, it is a change of the usual
grapefruit and melba toast, I'm sure.

550
00:38:10,271 --> 00:38:13,069
"Compliments
of Bonanza Jellybean."

551
00:38:13,107 --> 00:38:15,075
She'll be up
to see you directly.

552
00:38:25,453 --> 00:38:27,444
Yep?

553
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:31,288
Welcome, partner!

554
00:38:31,325 --> 00:38:33,657
You seem to know
who I am.

555
00:38:33,694 --> 00:38:35,992
Maybe even what I am.

556
00:38:37,098 --> 00:38:38,690
Thanks
for the breakfast.

557
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,497
Oh I know about
Sissy Hankshaw, all right.

558
00:38:41,535 --> 00:38:44,026
I've done a little
hitchhiking myself.

559
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:46,039
I'd heard tales
about you

560
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,837
from people I'd meet
in jail cells and truck stops.

561
00:38:48,876 --> 00:38:50,844
Jail cells?

562
00:38:50,878 --> 00:38:53,847
I heard about your, uh...
wonderful thumbs.

563
00:38:53,881 --> 00:38:56,145
Hm...

564
00:38:56,183 --> 00:38:59,050
Well, you may claim that
I have an unfair advantage,

565
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:02,487
but no more so
than Nijinsky,

566
00:39:02,523 --> 00:39:04,582
whose reputation as the world's
most incomparable dancer

567
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:07,560
is untainted by the fact
that his feet were abnormal...

568
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,189
havin' the bone structure
of bird feet.

569
00:39:10,231 --> 00:39:12,461
Nature built Nijinsky
to dance,

570
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,367
me to direct traffic.

571
00:39:31,052 --> 00:39:33,043
The example of your life

572
00:39:33,087 --> 00:39:35,920
has helped me in my struggle
to be a cowgirl.

573
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:38,754
- Tell me about it.
- About what?

574
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:42,092
About being a cowgirl.
When you say the word,

575
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:45,792
you make it sound like it was painted
in radium on the side of a pearl.

576
00:39:50,771 --> 00:39:54,764
Well, I saw my first cowgirl
in a Sears catalog.

577
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,777
I was three.

578
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:00,713
Up until then, I'd only
ever heard of cowboys.

579
00:40:00,748 --> 00:40:03,774
Years later,
my real struggle began.

580
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:07,413
I had been teased
by my classmates for some time

581
00:40:07,455 --> 00:40:10,390
about my particular
fantasy.

582
00:40:10,424 --> 00:40:14,588
Cowgirls exist as an image,
a fairly common one.

583
00:40:14,628 --> 00:40:17,358
The idea of cowgirls,

584
00:40:17,398 --> 00:40:20,561
especially for little girls,
prevails in our culture.

585
00:40:20,601 --> 00:40:23,229
Therefore,
it seems to me

586
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:26,671
that the existence
of cowgirls should prevail.

587
00:40:26,707 --> 00:40:29,175
I mean, otherwise
they're being fooled.

588
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:33,078
Like in the Rodeo Hall of Fame
in Oklahoma City,

589
00:40:33,114 --> 00:40:35,605
there are just two cowgirls.
Two...

590
00:40:35,649 --> 00:40:37,708
and both of them
were trick riders.

591
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:42,484
Trick ridin' is what cowgirls
have almost always done in rodeo.

592
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:47,324
Our society sure likes to see
its unconventional women do tricks.

593
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:51,127
That's what prostitutes call it...
you know, "trickin"'?

594
00:40:55,569 --> 00:40:59,061
Did you know that cowgirls
have been around for many centuries?

595
00:40:59,106 --> 00:41:03,338
Long before America.

596
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:04,844
In ancient India,
the care of cattle

597
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,780
was always left up to these
young women they called "gopis."

598
00:41:07,815 --> 00:41:10,909
Now being alone
with the cows all the time,

599
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:15,285
these gopis got awfully horny,
just like we do here.

600
00:41:15,322 --> 00:41:17,290
Each gopi was in love
with Krishna,

601
00:41:17,324 --> 00:41:19,849
a good lookin' hunk
of a god,

602
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,362
who played the flute
like it was going out of style.

603
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,864
And when the moon
was full,

604
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,958
this Krishna would play
his flute by the river

605
00:41:27,001 --> 00:41:28,628
and call the gopis to him.

606
00:41:28,669 --> 00:41:32,196
Then he would
multiply himself

607
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,936
16,000 times...
one for each gopi...

608
00:41:35,976 --> 00:41:39,434
and make love to each one
the way she most desired.

609
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,176
There they were...

610
00:41:42,216 --> 00:41:45,413
16,000 gopis balling
Krishna on the riverbank

611
00:41:45,452 --> 00:41:47,977
and the energy
of their merging was so great,

612
00:41:48,022 --> 00:41:52,152
that it created a huge oneness,
a total union of love,

613
00:41:52,193 --> 00:41:54,388
and it was God.

614
00:41:55,629 --> 00:41:57,824
Quite a picture, huh?

615
00:41:57,865 --> 00:42:00,732
Wow.

616
00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:06,139
Cowgirls...!

617
00:42:06,173 --> 00:42:08,767
Well, that couldn't be
Krishna, could it?

618
00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:12,210
A bit shrill for a flute.
Just our rotten luck.

619
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:18,384
Well, I gotta run.
Delores says I'm needed.

620
00:42:18,419 --> 00:42:22,515
Somebody's here.
Maybe it's the Countess.

621
00:42:34,435 --> 00:42:38,371
# Wondering, wondering #

622
00:42:38,405 --> 00:42:40,839
# Wanting it all #

623
00:42:40,874 --> 00:42:44,674
# A curious soul... #

624
00:42:44,712 --> 00:42:47,237
# Astray #

625
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:52,113
# A curious soul... #

626
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:56,248
# Astray. #

627
00:43:44,638 --> 00:43:47,630
So you look like a big bird,
a wonderful bird.

628
00:43:47,675 --> 00:43:51,042
Go down and you protect
the product like...

629
00:43:51,078 --> 00:43:53,569
But I'm not a bird, sir.
I'm a girl.

630
00:43:53,614 --> 00:43:55,582
But you look like a bird to me

631
00:43:55,616 --> 00:43:57,777
and you will look to the people
who will watch the commercial.

632
00:43:57,818 --> 00:43:59,649
Come on, Sissy.
We're working here.

633
00:43:59,687 --> 00:44:02,713
Okay... slowly you rise.

634
00:44:02,756 --> 00:44:05,316
And you look at the product,
you turn around

635
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,259
and the camera
will then see you,

636
00:44:07,294 --> 00:44:09,455
and the camera's
over there, remember.

637
00:44:09,496 --> 00:44:11,657
- You got it?
- Yes, sir.

638
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:13,326
All right,
then let's do it.

639
00:44:14,702 --> 00:44:18,035
And remember...
just be great, okay?

640
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,040
Thank you, sir.

641
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,235
Okay, do it.
Go down...

642
00:44:23,377 --> 00:44:24,969
and stand by.

643
00:44:25,012 --> 00:44:27,742
Music. Action!

644
00:45:21,068 --> 00:45:23,059
Cut!
We do it again.

645
00:45:24,505 --> 00:45:27,872
Delores zonks out on peyote
at least once a week.

646
00:45:27,908 --> 00:45:30,638
But so far her third vision
hasn't happened.

647
00:45:30,677 --> 00:45:33,202
Niwetúkame, the mother goddess,
it seems

648
00:45:33,247 --> 00:45:34,771
has not gotten back
in touch with her yet.

649
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:35,804
Huh.

650
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:39,148
Meanwhile, she and Debbie
are rivaling each other

651
00:45:39,186 --> 00:45:41,211
like a couple
of crosstown high schools.

652
00:45:41,255 --> 00:45:45,589
Tension... cowgirl tension.
What a drag.

653
00:45:45,626 --> 00:45:47,856
Well, what is
Debbie's position?

654
00:45:47,895 --> 00:45:50,796
Well, Debbie says that if women
are to take charge again,

655
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,924
they must do it
in a feminine way.

656
00:45:52,966 --> 00:45:56,561
They mustn't resort to aggressive
and violent masculine methods.

657
00:45:56,603 --> 00:45:59,766
She says that it's up to women
to show themselves better than men.

658
00:45:59,807 --> 00:46:02,742
To love men and set
good examples for them.

659
00:46:02,776 --> 00:46:04,801
Guide them tenderly
toward the new age.

660
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,473
She's a real dreamer,
that Debbie dear.

661
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:11,211
So, you don't agree
with Debbie then?

662
00:46:11,251 --> 00:46:13,481
Well, I wouldn't
say that.

663
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,385
I expect she's right
ultimately.

664
00:46:15,422 --> 00:46:18,585
But I'm with Delores when it comes
to fighting for what's mine.

665
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:21,958
This is cowgirl territory,
and I'll stand with Delores

666
00:46:21,995 --> 00:46:23,963
and fight any bastards
who might deny it.

667
00:46:23,997 --> 00:46:27,592
I guess I've always
been a scrapper.

668
00:46:27,634 --> 00:46:31,297
Look, this scar...

669
00:46:31,338 --> 00:46:34,501
only 12 years old and I was
felled by a silver bullet.

670
00:47:32,366 --> 00:47:34,891
He's here.

671
00:47:36,737 --> 00:47:40,104
Look at him...
perverse as a pink pickle.

672
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,471
Hmm.

673
00:47:41,508 --> 00:47:43,408
Well, he's in a snit.

674
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,502
He wants to see you
after the barbecue.

675
00:47:45,546 --> 00:47:48,140
- Oh really?
- Huh.

676
00:47:48,181 --> 00:47:50,308
Well, why don't you go ahead
and get the girls,

677
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:52,545
'cause he's gonna
see me right now.

678
00:47:52,586 --> 00:47:54,053
Okay.

679
00:48:40,233 --> 00:48:42,360
You will all be rounded up
and sent to prison

680
00:48:42,402 --> 00:48:44,267
if this goes any farther.

681
00:48:44,304 --> 00:48:46,465
This is not your ranch.

682
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:50,169
You pathetic
little cutesy-poos.

683
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:52,178
Do you actually believe

684
00:48:52,212 --> 00:48:55,613
that this exhibition
of childlike melodrama

685
00:48:55,649 --> 00:48:57,446
is advancing
the cause of freedom?

686
00:48:57,484 --> 00:48:59,145
Yes!

687
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,087
You owe us.
This here ranch is token payment

688
00:49:02,122 --> 00:49:04,215
to your disgusting
exploitations.

689
00:49:04,257 --> 00:49:06,589
That's right!

690
00:49:09,997 --> 00:49:12,727
Then take it.

691
00:49:15,969 --> 00:49:17,960
Go for it, girls!

692
00:49:19,806 --> 00:49:22,240
Go to your bunkhouse
and stay there.

693
00:49:34,121 --> 00:49:35,816
Better reach
for your spray cans.

694
00:49:35,856 --> 00:49:37,619
Yee-hah!

695
00:49:46,299 --> 00:49:47,960
Not one of these pussies
has been washed in weeks.

696
00:49:48,001 --> 00:49:49,593
Yeah, smell this! Woo.

697
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:55,404
Ooh!

698
00:50:03,517 --> 00:50:05,178
Shit, oh goodness!

699
00:50:29,242 --> 00:50:31,972
Any of you ladies
who'd like to join us

700
00:50:32,012 --> 00:50:35,448
you're welcome to stay as full-working
partners at the Rubber Rose.

701
00:50:35,482 --> 00:50:37,575
The rest of you get packed,
and I mean now!

702
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:42,054
You've got 15 minutes to move
your lard-asses off this ranch.

703
00:50:56,036 --> 00:50:59,335
# Cowgirl pride... #

704
00:50:59,372 --> 00:51:03,206
# Cowgirl pride... #

705
00:51:14,221 --> 00:51:18,385
Torn between her loyalty
to her benefactor, the Countess

706
00:51:18,425 --> 00:51:21,758
and her growing affection
for Jellybean and the cowgirls,

707
00:51:21,795 --> 00:51:25,356
a confused Sissy
hit the road

708
00:51:25,398 --> 00:51:27,696
with not a Pontiac
in sight.

709
00:51:28,769 --> 00:51:32,068
# Cowgirl, cowgirl... #

710
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:46,578
Ha ha!

711
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,281
Ha ha!

712
00:51:48,321 --> 00:51:50,448
Ha ha!

713
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,322
Ho-ho.

714
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,524
Ho-ho.

715
00:51:58,565 --> 00:52:00,965
Ho-ho.

716
00:52:20,987 --> 00:52:23,512
Hee hee!

717
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,923
Hee hee!

718
00:52:25,959 --> 00:52:27,654
Hee hee!

719
00:52:32,966 --> 00:52:36,800
Ha ha. Ho ho.
Hee hee.

720
00:52:36,837 --> 00:52:38,828
Hey, wait!

721
00:53:00,527 --> 00:53:02,757
Come on, baby!
I'll make you supper.

722
00:53:08,401 --> 00:53:10,801
I'm a friend
of Bonanza Jellybean's.

723
00:53:10,837 --> 00:53:13,135
l... I know.

724
00:53:22,749 --> 00:53:25,479
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

725
00:53:29,522 --> 00:53:32,320
There's been some trouble
on the ranch, you know?

726
00:53:32,359 --> 00:53:34,327
It's so dark now.

727
00:53:34,361 --> 00:53:37,922
Doubt if I could find my way back
by myself.

728
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:40,694
You save your breath
for the climb.

729
00:54:26,913 --> 00:54:28,608
I don't know
how to polka.

730
00:54:28,648 --> 00:54:30,843
Me neither.

731
00:54:39,592 --> 00:54:43,551
Personally I prefer
Stevie Wonder or Tony Bennett,

732
00:54:43,596 --> 00:54:45,564
but what the hell?

733
00:54:45,598 --> 00:54:49,728
Those cowgirls are always
complaining and bitching

734
00:54:49,769 --> 00:54:52,431
about there's only
"one station in the area

735
00:54:52,472 --> 00:54:54,633
and all it does
is ever play polkas."

736
00:54:54,674 --> 00:54:58,838
Well, I say you can
dance to anything

737
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:02,109
as long as you
feel like dancing.

738
00:55:02,148 --> 00:55:05,015
I pledge to you tonight
from this office

739
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:07,451
that I will do everything
in my power to ensure

740
00:55:07,487 --> 00:55:09,455
that the guilty are
brought to justice

741
00:55:09,489 --> 00:55:13,482
and that such abuses are purged
from our political processes,

742
00:55:13,526 --> 00:55:17,929
in the years to come
long after I have left this office.

743
00:55:17,964 --> 00:55:20,023
Some people...

744
00:55:30,777 --> 00:55:32,768
Sissy...

745
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:37,143
the earth is alive.

746
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:42,311
She burns from the heat

747
00:55:42,355 --> 00:55:44,823
of eternal cosmic longing.

748
00:55:44,858 --> 00:55:48,453
- She longs for her mate.
- Hm.

749
00:55:48,495 --> 00:55:52,431
She groans, she moans...

750
00:55:52,465 --> 00:55:56,162
she turns softly
in her sleep.

751
00:56:02,308 --> 00:56:04,776
I love those cowgirls.

752
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:12,977
But...

753
00:56:16,923 --> 00:56:22,589
I just can't be a party to their...
utopian dreaming.

754
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,623
Hmm.

755
00:56:35,241 --> 00:56:38,005
What do you
believe in, then?

756
00:56:41,881 --> 00:56:44,247
Ha ha...

757
00:56:44,284 --> 00:56:46,479
ho ho...

758
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:48,510
hee hee.

759
00:58:34,627 --> 00:58:37,619
This is uh, point 3,
north 20 zero east.

760
00:58:37,664 --> 00:58:41,566
Roger. Standby...
we'll call you back.

761
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,535
Where the hell
are those cranes?

762
00:58:45,705 --> 00:58:48,640
When in doubt,
keep moving.

763
00:58:48,675 --> 00:58:51,337
There was no road
that did not expect her

764
00:58:51,377 --> 00:58:54,437
nor vehicle
she could not command.

765
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,415
In the post office boxes
that she maintained

766
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,645
near a dozen different
Indian reservations

767
00:58:59,686 --> 00:59:03,679
she frequently found letters
from the liberated ranch.

768
00:59:03,723 --> 00:59:06,749
And thus,
wherever she traveled,

769
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:09,990
Jellybean traveled with her.

770
00:59:25,411 --> 00:59:27,675
Sissy, don't act dumb
with me!

771
00:59:29,949 --> 00:59:33,009
The cowgirls are involved
in this whooping crane disappearance.

772
00:59:33,052 --> 00:59:35,145
You know perfectly well
they are.

773
00:59:35,188 --> 00:59:37,554
Last seen in Canada,
didn't make it to Texas...

774
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:40,525
Siwash Lake is between
Canada and Texas.

775
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,529
The cowgirls have possession
of Siwash Lake!

776
00:59:43,563 --> 00:59:46,031
I don't know anything
about it.

777
00:59:46,065 --> 00:59:48,863
Sissy!

778
00:59:48,901 --> 00:59:52,667
You are trying to protect
those scuzzy bitches.

779
00:59:52,705 --> 00:59:56,197
Well, "Let conscience be your guide,"
as my mommy used to say,

780
00:59:56,242 --> 00:59:58,210
but it won't work.

781
00:59:58,244 --> 01:00:01,111
Those stinking sluts
are going to suffer!

782
01:00:01,147 --> 01:00:03,274
Shut your mouth!

783
01:00:06,552 --> 01:00:08,247
Argh!

784
01:00:08,287 --> 01:00:09,686
Oh, oh dear!

785
01:00:11,724 --> 01:00:11,951
Ahh.

786
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:16,923
Ooh.

787
01:00:48,494 --> 01:00:50,962
"Sissy, I'm remembering
your sweet hands on my scar.

788
01:00:50,997 --> 01:00:54,694
In a few minutes, I'm going to return
to the scene of our love.

789
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:57,202
Last spring Debbie and I
left mountains of brown rice

790
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:59,261
for the cranes to munch.
And they stayed at the pond

791
01:00:59,305 --> 01:01:01,273
longer than they ever had
in the past.

792
01:01:01,307 --> 01:01:04,037
This time, we're gonna try
a different diet on them

793
01:01:04,076 --> 01:01:06,271
to see if they won't stay
even longer.

794
01:01:06,312 --> 01:01:09,338
By the way, I'm visiting
the Chink once a week again.

795
01:01:09,382 --> 01:01:11,612
Now you know
my little secret, huh?

796
01:01:11,651 --> 01:01:13,744
Well, I hear that you
don't exactly sit at his feet

797
01:01:13,786 --> 01:01:15,754
listening to Bible stories.

798
01:01:15,788 --> 01:01:18,882
He's really something, isn't he?
The billy goat.

799
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:23,055
I love you,
Bonanza Jellybean."

800
01:01:39,912 --> 01:01:43,143
Well, he's not
out of danger.

801
01:01:43,182 --> 01:01:46,242
But I think we can safely say
he's gonna make it.

802
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:48,845
Now I'd be pretty
surprised if he didn't.

803
01:01:48,888 --> 01:01:52,722
However, there is evidence
of injury to the frontal lobe.

804
01:01:52,758 --> 01:01:55,522
And I have reason to fear
that this injury may be permanent.

805
01:01:55,561 --> 01:01:57,654
Brain damage?

806
01:01:57,697 --> 01:02:00,165
You mean he's gonna
be a vegetable?

807
01:02:00,199 --> 01:02:03,396
A vegetable?

808
01:02:04,403 --> 01:02:06,428
No, I wouldn't say that.

809
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:09,566
We won't know the extent
of the injury for some days.

810
01:02:09,609 --> 01:02:12,237
But there is
a genuine possibility

811
01:02:12,278 --> 01:02:15,247
of severe and lasting
behavioral defects.

812
01:02:15,281 --> 01:02:18,808
I wouldn't classify it in
the "vegetable" category, however.

813
01:02:22,054 --> 01:02:24,147
Thumbs that not once
in a lifetime

814
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:26,181
had been raised in anger,

815
01:02:26,225 --> 01:02:29,058
that had often known bliss
but never violence,

816
01:02:29,095 --> 01:02:33,122
that were wound 'round
with artistic skill and athletic glory

817
01:02:33,165 --> 01:02:36,498
now had been reduced
to the status of weapons.

818
01:02:36,536 --> 01:02:39,562
A sorrowful Sissy
had her thumbs transport her

819
01:02:39,605 --> 01:02:42,768
to the one person she knew
who might disarm her...

820
01:02:42,808 --> 01:02:45,868
or should we say,
"disthumb" her.

821
01:02:51,751 --> 01:02:53,150
I'm afraid
I can't help you.

822
01:02:53,185 --> 01:02:55,619
- Oh Doctor!
- Please, child.

823
01:02:55,655 --> 01:02:57,646
Don't be dismayed.

824
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:00,420
We all have our problems
these days.

825
01:03:00,459 --> 01:03:02,586
But as the painter
Van Gogh said,

826
01:03:02,628 --> 01:03:06,462
"Mysteries remain, sorrow
or melancholy remains,

827
01:03:06,499 --> 01:03:08,729
but the everlasting
negative is balanced

828
01:03:08,768 --> 01:03:11,965
by the positive work which
thus is achieved after all."

829
01:03:12,004 --> 01:03:14,472
I don't suppose that means
very much to you.

830
01:03:14,507 --> 01:03:19,001
I have retired... a victim
of a malpractice suit.

831
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:21,013
- Oh...
- My last operation

832
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:23,447
was a simple reworking
of a boy's nose.

833
01:03:23,482 --> 01:03:25,450
I was a bit
overenthusiastic,

834
01:03:25,484 --> 01:03:28,510
succumbing to my suppressed
artistic drives,

835
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:30,522
I sculpted,
in living flesh,

836
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:33,719
on the face
of little Bernie Schwartz

837
01:03:33,759 --> 01:03:36,023
the world's first
cubistic nose.

838
01:03:40,633 --> 01:03:43,796
Ah, the thumb!

839
01:03:43,836 --> 01:03:47,897
The thumb, the thumb,
the thumb.

840
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:51,740
The thumb, the thumb,
the thumb.

841
01:03:54,614 --> 01:03:57,606
One of evolution's
most ingenious inventions.

842
01:03:57,650 --> 01:03:59,618
A built-in tool,

843
01:03:59,652 --> 01:04:01,813
sensitive to texture, contour,
and temperature.

844
01:04:01,854 --> 01:04:05,915
An alchemical lever,
the secret key to technology,

845
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:09,394
the link between
the mind and art.

846
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:11,419
The humanizing device.

847
01:04:11,464 --> 01:04:15,161
The marmoset and the lemur
are thumbless.

848
01:04:15,201 --> 01:04:17,499
None of the new world monkeys
has opposable thumbs.

849
01:04:17,536 --> 01:04:20,096
The spider monkey's thumbs
are absent

850
01:04:20,139 --> 01:04:21,834
or reduced
to a tiny tubercle.

851
01:04:21,874 --> 01:04:24,638
The thumbs
of the potto are set

852
01:04:24,677 --> 01:04:28,613
at an angle of 180 degrees
to the other digits.

853
01:04:31,217 --> 01:04:33,185
And so...

854
01:04:33,219 --> 01:04:35,619
you are demanding at last,

855
01:04:35,655 --> 01:04:40,422
the privileges of thumb that nature
has perversely denied you?

856
01:04:42,294 --> 01:04:44,455
I just want to be normal,
Doctor.

857
01:04:44,497 --> 01:04:48,365
Give me that old-fashioned
normality.

858
01:04:48,401 --> 01:04:50,892
It was good enough
for Crazy Horse,

859
01:04:50,936 --> 01:04:53,166
and it's good enough
for me.

860
01:04:55,741 --> 01:04:58,335
Ah yes.

861
01:05:00,046 --> 01:05:02,708
Very well, my dear.

862
01:05:02,748 --> 01:05:06,081
Here's what we can do.

863
01:07:27,827 --> 01:07:29,954
The whooping cranes
are here, all right.

864
01:07:29,995 --> 01:07:31,622
They're in fine shape...

865
01:07:31,664 --> 01:07:34,724
and as you must have saw
from your flying machine...

866
01:07:34,767 --> 01:07:37,395
unrestrained,
free to go as they please.

867
01:07:37,436 --> 01:07:41,532
But this is private property
and you aren't setting a foot on it.

868
01:07:41,574 --> 01:07:43,906
None of you.

869
01:07:43,943 --> 01:07:45,911
We'll be back, and when we come back
we'll have a court order

870
01:07:45,945 --> 01:07:47,469
and a fistful
of search warrants.

871
01:07:49,081 --> 01:07:51,072
I'm scared of you.

872
01:07:51,116 --> 01:07:54,574
Yee-hah!

873
01:08:01,193 --> 01:08:04,526
It will be my extreme pleasure
to report to the President

874
01:08:04,563 --> 01:08:07,930
who has been gravely concerned
about the fate of our whooping cranes...

875
01:08:07,967 --> 01:08:11,198
...and the Interior Secretary
and the American people

876
01:08:11,237 --> 01:08:14,638
that the entire flock of cranes
is, indeed, at Siwash Lake,

877
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:17,267
and in apparently
healthy condition.

878
01:08:17,309 --> 01:08:19,277
The cranes have built
brooding nests

879
01:08:19,311 --> 01:08:21,279
around the entire
circumference of the lake,

880
01:08:21,313 --> 01:08:23,508
and have hatched
chicks there.

881
01:08:23,549 --> 01:08:27,883
Uh, including the young birds, there are
approximately 60 cranes in the flock.

882
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,253
While this is good news,
it's also quite bewildering.

883
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:33,884
Er, whooping cranes
are territorially-minded

884
01:08:33,926 --> 01:08:37,054
and have never been known to nest
within a mile of each other,

885
01:08:37,096 --> 01:08:39,826
and yet here they're
virtually side by side.

886
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:45,364
The whooping crane has been driven
to the edge of extinction...

887
01:08:45,404 --> 01:08:48,965
...by an aggressive, brutal,
patriarchal system

888
01:08:49,008 --> 01:08:51,101
intent on subduing
the earth

889
01:08:51,143 --> 01:08:53,543
and establishing its dominion
over all things

890
01:08:53,579 --> 01:08:59,040
In the name of God the Father,
law, order, and economic progress.

891
01:08:59,084 --> 01:09:04,386
From men, the whooping crane
has received neither love nor respect.

892
01:09:04,423 --> 01:09:06,857
Men have drained
the crane's marshes...

893
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:09,588
...stolen its eggs,
invaded its privacy,

894
01:09:09,628 --> 01:09:13,291
polluted its food,
blown it apart with buckshot.

895
01:09:13,332 --> 01:09:15,698
Obviously, a patriarchal society
does not deserve

896
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:17,702
anything as grand
and beautiful

897
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:21,263
and wild and free
as the whooping crane.

898
01:09:21,307 --> 01:09:23,571
You men have failed
in your duty to the crane,

899
01:09:23,609 --> 01:09:25,600
now it is women's turn.

900
01:09:25,644 --> 01:09:28,169
The cranes are
in our charge now.

901
01:09:28,213 --> 01:09:31,512
We will protect them as long
as they still require protection,

902
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:34,917
while working toward a day
when the creatures of this earth

903
01:09:34,954 --> 01:09:39,584
no longer have to suffer man's egoism,
insensitivity, and greed.

904
01:09:39,625 --> 01:09:42,560
We refuse your order.
We say...

905
01:09:42,594 --> 01:09:44,994
...take your order and shove it.
- It's Jellybean!

906
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:48,261
This awesome bird's staying with us.
Get lost, mac.

907
01:09:49,702 --> 01:09:51,693
# I've pinned myself
against the wall #

908
01:09:51,737 --> 01:09:53,398
# Stationed
like a horse in stall #

909
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:57,170
# Just wishin'
they might call me art #

910
01:09:57,209 --> 01:09:59,200
# There I hung
in the hall #

911
01:09:59,244 --> 01:10:00,939
# Collectin' dust,
that's all #

912
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:04,381
# That's all
I needed to do #

913
01:10:04,416 --> 01:10:06,748
# While in the corner,
quite a size #

914
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:08,514
# He sits talkin'
whisky-wise #

915
01:10:08,554 --> 01:10:12,081
# Hopin'
to throw me off #

916
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:14,092
# But no matter
how he tries #

917
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:16,094
# I'll just look him
in the eyes #

918
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:19,097
# That's all
that I need to do #

919
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:22,623
# That's all it took to see
I was wasting time #

920
01:10:22,668 --> 01:10:24,636
# That's all it took to see #

921
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:26,661
# I was
walkin' the line #

922
01:10:26,705 --> 01:10:30,232
# I'm gonna ride high
as can be #

923
01:10:30,275 --> 01:10:32,573
# I look behind
and see them #

924
01:10:32,611 --> 01:10:35,671
# Following me. #

925
01:10:36,682 --> 01:10:39,082
# Yee-hoo! #

926
01:10:43,789 --> 01:10:46,781
there came a point
when Delores felt compelled

927
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:50,056
to get in her peyote wagon
and leave the ranch.

928
01:10:50,095 --> 01:10:52,086
She had a mission
to perform.

929
01:10:52,131 --> 01:10:56,033
The cowgirls protested
that it was much too dangerous.

930
01:10:56,068 --> 01:10:58,559
But they knew better
than to try to interfere.

931
01:10:58,604 --> 01:11:03,132
Unfortunately, there were federal agents
who had no such qualms.

932
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:16,082
Yeah, yeah, right, right...

933
01:11:49,922 --> 01:11:52,049
We heard on the radio

934
01:11:52,091 --> 01:11:55,652
where they set
Delores' bail at $50,000.

935
01:11:56,762 --> 01:11:59,629
Man, right when
we really needed her.

936
01:12:03,702 --> 01:12:06,296
Whoo-hoo! Yeow!

937
01:12:24,756 --> 01:12:26,986
Well, let's celebrate!

938
01:12:36,502 --> 01:12:38,629
Ain't that
just like women?

939
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:42,232
Looks like every time
we get together,

940
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:44,139
- Things are in a mess.
- So be it.

941
01:12:44,176 --> 01:12:47,839
It's pretty serious this time,
though, huh? All these guns?

942
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:51,111
You're actually prepared
to kill and die for whooping cranes?

943
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:54,415
Hell, no!
The cranes are wonderful

944
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:56,421
but I'm not in this
for whooping cranes.

945
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:58,218
I'm in it for cowgirls.

946
01:12:58,257 --> 01:13:01,158
If we cowgirls give in to authority
on this crane issue,

947
01:13:01,193 --> 01:13:03,423
then cowgirls become
just another compromise.

948
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:07,660
I want a finer fate than that...
for me and every other cowgirl.

949
01:13:07,699 --> 01:13:11,157
Better no cowgirls at all
than cowgirls compromised.

950
01:13:11,203 --> 01:13:13,467
How did this business
get started anyhow?

951
01:13:13,505 --> 01:13:15,769
Why are the birds
nesting here?

952
01:13:15,807 --> 01:13:18,241
You were aware we were
feeding them, weren't you?

953
01:13:18,277 --> 01:13:21,974
We fed 'em brown rice.
They stayed over a couple of extra days.

954
01:13:22,014 --> 01:13:24,448
Then we decided to try
something different.

955
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:27,884
We mixed our brown rice with fishmeal.
Whoopers love seafood.

956
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:32,619
Then Delores suggested
another ingredient.

957
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,250
We think
that's what did the trick.

958
01:13:34,293 --> 01:13:37,262
- You mean...?
- Peyote!

959
01:13:37,296 --> 01:13:39,423
They're drugged?

960
01:13:39,464 --> 01:13:42,058
Oh come off it, Sissy.
What do you mean, "drugged"?

961
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:44,660
Every living thing
is a chemical composition

962
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:47,228
and anything that is added to it
changes that composition.

963
01:13:47,272 --> 01:13:51,572
If you eat a cheeseburger
or a Three Musketeers bar...

964
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:54,135
it changes
your body chemistry.

965
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:56,147
The kind of food you eat,

966
01:13:56,181 --> 01:13:59,378
the kind of air you breathe
can change your mental state.

967
01:13:59,418 --> 01:14:02,979
- Does that mean you're drugged?
- No, I guess not.

968
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:07,017
"Drugged" is a stupid word.

969
01:14:10,729 --> 01:14:13,960
But the peyote is obviously
affecting their brains.

970
01:14:13,999 --> 01:14:15,967
It's made them break
a migratory pattern

971
01:14:16,001 --> 01:14:18,196
that goes back
thousands of years.

972
01:14:18,237 --> 01:14:20,205
The way I see it,

973
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:22,537
the peyote mellowed them out,
made them less uptight.

974
01:14:22,574 --> 01:14:26,442
They were afraid of humans
and bad weather.

975
01:14:26,478 --> 01:14:29,038
That's why they migrated
and kept to themselves.

976
01:14:29,081 --> 01:14:32,107
Peyote has enlightened them.

977
01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:35,711
It's taught them there's
nothing to fear but fear itself.

978
01:14:35,754 --> 01:14:39,349
Now they're digging life
and letting the bad vibes slide on.

979
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:42,019
"Don't worry,
Be happy."

980
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:45,587
Be here now.

981
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:47,599
This here discussion
is destined to become academic,

982
01:14:47,633 --> 01:14:50,864
because we've got less
than half a bag of peyote buttons left

983
01:14:50,902 --> 01:14:53,462
and Delores' run ended up
in the Sisters jail.

984
01:14:53,505 --> 01:14:55,405
So any day now,
we'll get a chance

985
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,840
to see how the whoopers behave
when they come down.

986
01:14:57,876 --> 01:15:02,779
But in the meantime,
I'd like to say this about fear...

987
01:15:02,814 --> 01:15:05,977
Judge Greenfield,
at the request of the ACLU,

988
01:15:06,018 --> 01:15:08,418
has granted a 48-hour extension
of the deadline

989
01:15:08,453 --> 01:15:11,616
by which the Rubber Rose cowgirls
must comply with his orders.

990
01:15:13,659 --> 01:15:15,718
Negotiations between
the cowgirls and the government

991
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:17,319
are expected to follow.

992
01:15:17,362 --> 01:15:20,388
Another "ride 'em in,"
the forewoman of the Rubber Rose Ranch,

993
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:23,094
a Delores del Ruby,
is now free on bond...

994
01:15:26,805 --> 01:15:28,864
...after having been
arrested in Sisters

995
01:15:28,907 --> 01:15:31,603
with more than 50 pounds
of peyote buttons.

996
01:15:31,643 --> 01:15:33,907
Her bail has been paid
by the owner of the besieged ranch,

997
01:15:33,945 --> 01:15:36,072
Countess Products, Inc.

998
01:15:36,114 --> 01:15:40,016
Ms. del Ruby's bail having come
from the tycoon's personal advisor,

999
01:15:40,052 --> 01:15:43,453
- A Dr. Robbins of New York City.
- Dr. Robbins?

1000
01:15:56,668 --> 01:15:59,728
It isn't for ourselves
that we take this stand...

1001
01:15:59,771 --> 01:16:02,535
it isn't for cowgirls.

1002
01:16:04,142 --> 01:16:06,542
It's for all the daughters
everywhere.

1003
01:16:06,578 --> 01:16:08,978
That ain't no lie!

1004
01:16:10,982 --> 01:16:14,281
This is an extremely
important confrontation.

1005
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:19,086
This is womankind's chance
to prove to her enemy

1006
01:16:19,124 --> 01:16:21,820
that she is willing
to fight and die!

1007
01:16:24,296 --> 01:16:27,390
And if we women
don't show here and now

1008
01:16:27,432 --> 01:16:30,230
that we're willing
to fight and die,

1009
01:16:30,268 --> 01:16:33,362
then our enemy
will never take us seriously.

1010
01:16:33,405 --> 01:16:35,873
That's right!

1011
01:16:35,907 --> 01:16:39,343
And men know that no matter
how strong our words,

1012
01:16:39,378 --> 01:16:41,846
or determined our deeds,

1013
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:45,907
there is a point where we'll back down
and give them their dinner.

1014
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:47,316
No way!

1015
01:16:57,329 --> 01:16:59,388
I love you.

1016
01:17:01,233 --> 01:17:04,862
Every time I tell you
I love you, you flinch.

1017
01:17:04,903 --> 01:17:08,202
That's your problem.

1018
01:17:10,776 --> 01:17:14,212
If I flinch when you say you love me,
it's both our problems.

1019
01:17:15,614 --> 01:17:18,276
My confusion
becomes your confusion.

1020
01:17:19,851 --> 01:17:22,012
Students
confuse teachers.

1021
01:17:23,822 --> 01:17:26,848
Patients confuse
psychiatrists.

1022
01:17:41,173 --> 01:17:43,437
Lovers
with confused hearts

1023
01:17:43,475 --> 01:17:46,842
confuse lovers
with clear ones.

1024
01:17:49,948 --> 01:17:52,007
I'm prepared to win!

1025
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:55,884
Victory for every female
living or dead...

1026
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:59,721
who has suffered under
the temporary defeat

1027
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:03,194
of masculine insensitivity
to their inner lives.

1028
01:18:03,228 --> 01:18:05,594
I'll fight the bastards!

1029
01:18:06,898 --> 01:18:09,366
I'll fight them with bean gas
if necessary.

1030
01:18:15,474 --> 01:18:17,999
Sun's gone down.

1031
01:18:18,043 --> 01:18:21,012
So those of you
who are not standing watch,

1032
01:18:21,046 --> 01:18:24,038
get a good night's sleep.

1033
01:18:24,082 --> 01:18:28,143
Tomorrow morning,
we'll plan our fight.

1034
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:34,589
Tomorrow afternoon, those of you
who would like to join me...

1035
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:37,220
in the reeds...

1036
01:18:40,866 --> 01:18:44,768
the cranes and I will be sharing
the last crumbs in the peyote sack.

1037
01:18:49,708 --> 01:18:52,268
I love you, Jelly.

1038
01:19:15,634 --> 01:19:18,569
Lost in a psychedelic
trance,

1039
01:19:18,603 --> 01:19:21,197
Delores, queen
of the whooping crane rustlers,

1040
01:19:21,239 --> 01:19:24,333
wandered among the nests
of those great birds

1041
01:19:24,376 --> 01:19:28,369
who would rather go extinct than change
their lives to suit the ways of men.

1042
01:19:28,413 --> 01:19:32,281
Peyote buttons sang
in Delores' brain like a choir,

1043
01:19:32,317 --> 01:19:35,218
and above
that ancient chorus,

1044
01:19:35,253 --> 01:19:37,949
there eventually rose
the voice of Niwetúkame,

1045
01:19:37,989 --> 01:19:41,755
the divine mother, calling
her daughter to her muddy throne.

1046
01:19:41,793 --> 01:19:47,322
There the promise
of the third vision was fulfilled.

1047
01:19:47,365 --> 01:19:51,301
But what was said,
and what was shown?

1048
01:20:33,612 --> 01:20:36,740
It is woman's mission

1049
01:20:36,781 --> 01:20:40,217
to destroy as well
as it is to give birth.

1050
01:20:40,251 --> 01:20:44,017
We will destroy
the tyranny of the dull,

1051
01:20:44,055 --> 01:20:46,285
but we cannot do it
with guns...

1052
01:20:47,292 --> 01:20:49,453
or with whips...

1053
01:20:49,494 --> 01:20:55,592
oh no, we will destroy
our enemy in other ways.

1054
01:20:55,634 --> 01:20:59,092
The peyote mother
has promised a fourth vision.

1055
01:21:01,373 --> 01:21:03,967
But it won't come
to me alone.

1056
01:21:04,009 --> 01:21:07,001
It'll come
to each of you...

1057
01:21:07,045 --> 01:21:11,038
every cowgirl
in the land!

1058
01:21:12,884 --> 01:21:15,853
But first we have to end
all this business

1059
01:21:15,887 --> 01:21:18,412
with the government
and the cranes.

1060
01:21:18,456 --> 01:21:21,357
It's been positive and fruitful,
but it's gone on far enough.

1061
01:21:21,393 --> 01:21:25,193
Playfulness ceases to have
a serious purpose...

1062
01:21:26,264 --> 01:21:29,392
when it takes itself
too seriously.

1063
01:21:59,264 --> 01:22:00,492
Well,
what we got to do

1064
01:22:00,532 --> 01:22:02,261
is one of us
has got to go up that hill

1065
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:05,667
and tell them boys that America
can have its whooping cranes back.

1066
01:22:05,704 --> 01:22:07,695
Now since
I'm the boss here, and

1067
01:22:07,739 --> 01:22:09,707
since I'm responsible
for a lot of you

1068
01:22:09,741 --> 01:22:11,675
choosing to be cowgirls
in the first place,

1069
01:22:11,710 --> 01:22:14,907
it's gonna be me
that goes.

1070
01:22:14,946 --> 01:22:17,744
No buts about it.
It's getting lighter by the second.

1071
01:22:17,782 --> 01:22:21,218
You partners
keep your heads down, all right?

1072
01:22:21,252 --> 01:22:23,652
I'll see you soon.
Ta-ta.

1073
01:22:58,790 --> 01:23:01,258
Yep, better get rid
of these.

1074
01:23:01,292 --> 01:23:03,351
Might give those
greenhorn dudes a fright.

1075
01:23:03,394 --> 01:23:05,555
She's gonna fire.

1076
01:23:06,865 --> 01:23:09,060
Shit! Shit!

1077
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:12,467
Hey, no, no, no...

1078
01:23:14,038 --> 01:23:16,199
You've got two minutes
to come out with your hands up!

1079
01:23:21,746 --> 01:23:24,306
No!
No, no, no!

1080
01:23:24,349 --> 01:23:27,045
No!
Stop it!

1081
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:41,156
Take that,
you bastard!

1082
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,698
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1083
01:25:09,888 --> 01:25:14,689
Rotten scar. I fell on a wooden horse
when I was 12.

1084
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:20,488
I wasn't really shot
with a silver bullet.

1085
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:25,795
Or was I?

1086
01:26:17,622 --> 01:26:19,817
You know, partners,

1087
01:26:19,857 --> 01:26:23,657
you can tune a guitar,
but you can't tuna fish.

1088
01:26:28,733 --> 01:26:32,533
God, but it's good
to be a cowgirl!

1089
01:26:37,208 --> 01:26:42,441
# Happy trails to you #

1090
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:47,349
# Until we meet again #

1091
01:26:47,385 --> 01:26:52,379
# Happy trails to you #

1092
01:26:52,423 --> 01:26:58,020
# Dearly parted friend #

1093
01:26:58,062 --> 01:27:02,795
# When we meet
out there #

1094
01:27:02,834 --> 01:27:08,067
# Where pastures
never end #

1095
01:27:08,106 --> 01:27:12,270
# Happy trails to you #

1096
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:19,216
# Until we meet again. #

1097
01:27:36,601 --> 01:27:38,125
Everything getting worse?

1098
01:27:38,169 --> 01:27:41,036
Yeah.

1099
01:27:41,072 --> 01:27:43,563
Everything's getting worse.

1100
01:27:43,608 --> 01:27:47,601
But it's also getting better.

1101
01:27:47,645 --> 01:27:51,012
- Yeah.
- Hm.

1102
01:27:51,049 --> 01:27:53,040
The Countess
has come to our aid.

1103
01:27:53,084 --> 01:27:57,748
The Rubber Rose Ranch has been
officially deeded over to the cowgirls.

1104
01:27:57,789 --> 01:28:00,656
I've been asked
to oversee the ranch

1105
01:28:00,691 --> 01:28:03,990
- For $300 a week.
- All right, huh?

1106
01:28:04,028 --> 01:28:08,089
And the Countess... he's not going to be
the vegetable doctors thought he was.

1107
01:28:08,132 --> 01:28:10,828
Here's a picture.

1108
01:28:14,739 --> 01:28:18,175
There he is.

1109
01:28:20,511 --> 01:28:25,073
Hmm...
I'm splitting the ranch.

1110
01:28:25,116 --> 01:28:28,347
Help me up.

1111
01:28:33,424 --> 01:28:38,862
Look, the westbound choo-choo's
out of here at 1:40. I'm on it.

1112
01:28:40,298 --> 01:28:42,425
Will you drive me
to the station, hmm?

1113
01:28:48,172 --> 01:28:52,871
Agh, don't ever bet
against paradox, ladies!

1114
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:56,676
If complexity doesn't get you,
paradox will!

1115
01:28:56,714 --> 01:28:58,443
Ha-ha!

1116
01:28:58,483 --> 01:29:00,815
Ho-ho!

1117
01:29:00,852 --> 01:29:03,616
Hee-hee!

1118
01:29:06,724 --> 01:29:08,885
The brown paper bag

1119
01:29:08,926 --> 01:29:12,157
is the only thing
civilized man has produced

1120
01:29:12,196 --> 01:29:14,960
that does not seem
out of place in nature.

1121
01:29:14,999 --> 01:29:17,729
Crumpled into a wad
of wrinkles

1122
01:29:17,768 --> 01:29:20,828
like the fossilized brain
of a dryad,

1123
01:29:20,872 --> 01:29:23,363
blending with rock
and vegetation

1124
01:29:23,407 --> 01:29:26,069
as if it were
a burrowing owl's doormat

1125
01:29:26,110 --> 01:29:28,374
or a jackrabbit's
underwear,

1126
01:29:28,412 --> 01:29:31,245
a number eight
kraft paper bag

1127
01:29:31,282 --> 01:29:33,978
lay discarded
in the Oregon hills

1128
01:29:34,018 --> 01:29:37,078
and appeared to live
where it lay.

1129
01:29:37,121 --> 01:29:40,887
Once long ago,
it had borne a package of buns

1130
01:29:40,925 --> 01:29:42,893
and a jar of mustard

1131
01:29:42,927 --> 01:29:45,020
to a kitchenette rendezvous
with a fried hamburger.

1132
01:29:45,062 --> 01:29:50,523
Most recently,
the bag had held love letters.

1133
01:29:50,568 --> 01:29:53,332
As a hole in an oak
hides a squirrel's family jewels,

1134
01:29:53,371 --> 01:29:55,566
the bag had hidden
love letters

1135
01:29:55,606 --> 01:29:57,801
in the bottom
of a bunkhouse trunk.

1136
01:29:57,842 --> 01:30:00,504
Then one day after work,

1137
01:30:00,545 --> 01:30:03,480
the lanky filly to whom
the letters were addressed,

1138
01:30:03,514 --> 01:30:07,541
gathered bag and contents
under her arm,

1139
01:30:07,585 --> 01:30:09,553
slipped down to the corral

1140
01:30:09,587 --> 01:30:11,748
past ranch hands
pitchin' horseshoes,

1141
01:30:11,789 --> 01:30:13,984
and ranch hands
flyin' Tibetan kites,

1142
01:30:14,025 --> 01:30:18,758
saddled up and trotted
into the hills.

1143
01:30:18,796 --> 01:30:20,764
A mile or so
from the bunkhouse,

1144
01:30:20,798 --> 01:30:22,823
she dismounted
and built a small fire.

1145
01:30:22,867 --> 01:30:26,598
She fed the fire letters,
one by one,

1146
01:30:26,637 --> 01:30:30,937
the way her girlfriend
had once fed her french fries.

1147
01:30:30,975 --> 01:30:34,308
As words such as "sweetheart"
and "honey britches"

1148
01:30:34,345 --> 01:30:37,542
and "forever" and "always"
burned away,

1149
01:30:37,582 --> 01:30:40,483
the cowgirl squirted
a few fat tears.

1150
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:45,455
Her eyes were so misty,
she forgot to burn the bag.
