1
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,718
If I'm not troubling you...

2
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,677
...I think I need to get some water for my horse.

3
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,719
Where do you come from?

4
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,354
Coahuila.

5
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,392
What brings you in Texas?

6
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,836
- I'm looking for a job? - What kind of job?

7
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,839
I'm a cowboy.

8
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,518
- Sister! Pepe! - Run Marianna, run!

9
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,717
Put your hands on your head.

10
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,756
- How many calves left? - 120.

11
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,473
That's a shitload.

12
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,878
- When is the boss coming back
from Houston? -Saturday afternoon.

13
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,798
Fucking mama's boy.

14
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,389
He says he is a rancher just
because they bought him this ranch...

15
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,272
But I never seen him out here working hard.

16
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,314
You're just mad because the only
woman you ever had is your hand.

17
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,957
Let's go to Midland this Saturday.

18
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,951
The border patrol will nab me in Midland.

19
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,351
Bullshit. Are you scared of women or what?

20
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,799
Augustin, close the goddamn gate.

21
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,839
- You like it? - It's the best horse I've ever seen.

22
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,915
- If you like him, he's yours. - Yeah, right.

23
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,874
Really. Take him.

24
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,432
But it's your horse.

25
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,752
Mine, yours... What's the difference?

26
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,519
This horse got "Pedro" branded in his brain.

27
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,113
It's yours.

28
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:04,394
No, it must have costed you a fortune.

29
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,958
Bullshit... It's yours now. Don't even get off of him.

30
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,674
Relax.

31
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,158
The border patrol is everywhere.

32
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,709
- It's fine man, don't worry. - Where are you going?

33
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,111
Where do you think? To get the girls.

34
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,234
Hurry up.

35
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,672
- That's Bob's wife from the cate, right? - Yes genius!

36
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,510
- But she is married. - So is the other one.

37
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,277
Your room is 205.

38
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,553
See you in three hours.

39
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,514
Only one hour.

40
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,073
Yes, sure.

41
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,428
- Music? - Ah, music, yes.

42
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,878
Crazy bitches.

43
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,874
Let's go.

44
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,594
Are you ok?

45
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,834
Are you ok?

46
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,316
He killed Melquiades Estrada.

47
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,551
The oldest is Elizabeth. She must be 14 now.

48
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,953
The other one is Yesenia, she is probably 12.

49
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:28,078
And this is my little son Aaron.

50
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,596
He's going to be a good cowboy.

51
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,314
And this one...

52
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,399
...is Evelia.

53
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,076
Evelia Camargo, my wife...

54
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,278
Wnen was the last time you saw them?

55
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,350
About... 5 years ago.

56
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,519
Promise me one thing, Pedro.

57
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,799
If I die here...

58
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,799
carry me back to my family...

59
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,793
...and bury me in my hometown.

60
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,596
I don't wanna get buried among the fuckin' billboards.

61
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,038
I'll die before you, I'm older.

62
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,553
Promise me!

63
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,392
We are here, right?

64
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,672
Move down to Ojinaga and head South.

65
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,279
Then turn East, and follow the sierra until you find Coahuila.

66
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,074
Then you'll get in a town called "El Toston".

67
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,837
20 kilometers between "El Toston" and El Nacimiento...

68
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,800
...is a little place called "Jimenez".

69
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,793
There's my home.

70
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,037
Go and find Evelia, my wife, and explain her.

71
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,878
I'll just throw you in the trash.

72
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,032
You'll take me back to Jimenez Pedro...

73
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,639
You promised.

74
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,794
Good morning.

75
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:01,109
- Watch out, a rattlesnake! It's not gonna bite anyone.

76
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:03,519
A dead man!

77
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:24,308
Get him out.

78
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:37,152
He's still breathing.

79
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:39,754
- I think that snake bit him. - Sure did.

80
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:41,394
Is he a "gringo"?

81
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:44,313
- He looks too dirty for a gringo. - Does he have any money?

82
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:48,834
I think it's too late for him.

83
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:54,191
Take it easy. I'm a friend.

84
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,109
Yes.

85
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:44,948
Tomas, go with them. I'll take the gringo to get cured.

86
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,752
Ok, deal.

87
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,876
The fucking gringo bit me.

88
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:35,632
- Dona Adriana, is Mariana at home? - Yes she's here.

89
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:39,915
What's going on?

90
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,552
Is he the one who got bit by the snake?

91
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,315
Get this gringo out of here. He's the one who broke my nose.

92
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:54,875
Are you sure?

93
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,877
Hell yes, you can't forget a white rat's face.

94
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,349
- He'll probably die. - Let him die.

95
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:01,073
Please...

96
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:05,714
Heal him.

97
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:07,755
Why?

98
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,435
Because...

99
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,352
...I need him alive.

100
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,308
Is he gonna get better?

101
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,354
From the poison, yes...

102
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:44,714
but if he gets gangrene, we'll have to cut off his foot.

103
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,074
Your call is ready.

104
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,992
At the farm Los Lombos, the city Ojinaga, Chihuahua of Mexico.

105
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,755
The asshole gringo woke up.

106
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,595
- Is there hot coffee? - I just made some.

107
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,358
Bring me the pot.

108
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:28,031
Now we're even asshole.

109
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:59,159
You wanna help us?

110
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,273
- You want some coffee? - Yes sir. Please.

111
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:11,672
Come sit with us.

112
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:21,755
Sit down.

113
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:30,270
- Do you have any food to sell us? - Food? I'll give you for free.

114
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,631
We have fresh meat.

115
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:36,393
Take as much as you want.

116
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,439
We had to kill it.

117
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:43,839
This damn bear was killing too many goats.

118
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:50,152
- Is this Coahuila? - Yes you are in Coahuila.

119
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,114
Do you know how to get to El Toston?

120
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:59,109
20 kilometers that way.

121
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:05,115
When you reach the sierra, head South and you'll get there.

122
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,438
What do they say on the TV?

123
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:37,828
Take it...

124
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:39,275
...for the pain.

125
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:47,795
- How much? - 20 pesos.

126
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:11,754
Do you know of any place called Jimenez?

127
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:13,798
No, none.

128
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:19,114
Manuel... you ever heard of Jimenez?

129
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:41,669
A little...

130
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:04,234
I don't know anyone called Melquiades.

131
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:16,110
- Where did you find a picture of me
and my kids. - Melquiades gave it to me.

132
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:28,671
Don't say stupid things.

133
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:31,479
You're gonna get me in trouble with my husband, Javier Martinez.

134
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:33,711
We don't know any Melquiades.

135
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:37,959
I'm sorry miss, I didn't want to offend you.

136
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,078
But he was my friend.

137
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,072
Go see Don Casimiro.

138
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:49,194
He knows everyone who passed through this town.

139
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,557
Maybe he can help you.

140
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:19,839
I am sure.

141
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:23,439
It doesn't exist.

142
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:25,514
Why?

143
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:45,435
Jimenez is a beautiful place.

144
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:49,195
It's between two hills.

145
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:52,990
The air is clean there...

146
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:56,199
...you feel like you can hug the mountains with your arms.

147
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:01,031
A stream with clear, fresh water bubbles up right out of the rocks.

148
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:04,718
If you go to Jimenez...

149
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:09,510
I swear to you, your heart will break with so much beauty.

150
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:10,152
Ask Melquiades for forgiveness.
