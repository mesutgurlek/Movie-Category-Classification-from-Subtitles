* The country was big
When it was new

2
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,947
* The best men was big
And their yarns was too

3
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,427
* And their tallest tales
Folks believed was true

4
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:33,159
* So the more they were told
The more they grew

* King of the Wild Frontier

00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,840
* History remembers the name of his gun

8
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,368
* And some of the deeds he really done

9
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:50,939
* But most of his chores
For freedom and fun

10
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:54,612
* Got turned into legends
And this here is one

11
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:58,214
* Davy, Davy Crockett

12
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,852
* Helping his fame spread wide

13
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:05,227
* Had a lot of furs that he aimed to ship

14
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:08,495
* And he set his mind on a river trip

15
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:12,368
* When a braggin' boatman
Give him some lip

16
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:16,170
* A'claimin' there was no man

19
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:36,393
Them Kentucky ants got
a bite like an alligator.

20
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,863
Sure ain't particular
what they chaw on.

21
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:48,598
Look at that, would you?
This is the longest hunt we ever been on.

22
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:52,372
- Biggest bunch of pelts we ever got, too.
- Leastwise, the heaviest.

23
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,312
Them packhorses is plum wore out
and so am I.

24
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,145
How much longer you figure
we got to walk, anyhow?

25
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,948
I figure we'll reach
the old Ohio pretty soon.

26
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,387
Yeah, sure am looking forward
to that boat ride.

27
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:09,485
Nothin' to do all day but sit in the sun
and fish all the way down the Natchez.

28
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,723
That's a mighty good idea
of yourn, Davy.

29
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,596
At least we'll get a better price
for our furs there.

30
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:18,728
You ain't foolin' me none.
You ain't thinking about the price of furs.

31
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:23,105
You're thinkin' about all that
new country we'll be lookin' at.

32
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,147
- Ow!

This ain't your night, is it?

36
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:45,120
I'm gonna turn in
before something else happens.

37
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,741
That fellow sang worse than you.

38
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,872
Ain't nothing living gonna
keep me awake tonight.

39
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,691
Hey, Davy?

40
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,728
- Hey, Davy?
- Now what?

41
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,695
There's something in bed with me.

42
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:20,756
Kiss it good night and go to sleep.

43

- Get a move on, Mahalia.

- * Hear the winds roar
- [horse neighs]

* Hurricane's a'comin'
Board up the door

50
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:29,632
* Load up the cannon
Call out the law

51
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:34,605
* Worstest calamity that folks ever saw

52
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:39,077
* Girls run and hide
Brave men shiver

53

* He's Mike Fink
King of the River *

54
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,210
What's going on here, anyway?

55
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,686
Something's got their fur riled up.

56
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,950
The landing's over there.

57
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:58,360
Well, boys, hope they don't run out of
Monongahela Red Eye this time!

58
00:04:58,431 --> 00:04:59,659
[Men laugh]

59
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,173
That ought to keep her from drifting.

60
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,278
Say, mister, which one of them fellas
is captain of this boat?

61
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,447
What did you say?

62
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,824
- He wants to know who the captain is.
- [Men laugh]

63
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,387
How long you bushwhackers
been holed up in the backwoods?

64
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,525
Everybody knows who the captain
of the Gullywhumper is.

65
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,161
It's me. Mike Fink.
King of the River.

66
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:42,367
Well, Captain, meet up with Davy Crockett.
King of the Wild Frontier.

67
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,044
Davy Crockett, huh?

68
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:52,312
It sure is a small world.
You're a foot shorter than you ought to be.

69
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,353
Don't worry, he's still a'growin'.

70
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,820
Like them yarns
they spread about him.

71
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,720
Mighty hard to live up to sometime.

72
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,726
Well, I don't have no trouble
livin' up to mine.

73
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:05,924
I am the original ring-tail roarer
from the Thunder Lightning country.

74
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,023
I'm a real snorter and a head-buster.

75
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,501
I can out-run, out-jump,
out-sing, out-swim,

76
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,334
out-dance, out-shoot,
out-eat, outright...

77
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,395
Out-talk?

78
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,375
Yeah, out-talk, out-cuss and out-fight

79
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:21,812
anybody in the whole Mississippi
and Ohio Rivers put together.

80
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,282
Interesting, but all we wanna know
is how far down you're going?

81
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:28,514
All the way to New Orleans, of course.
Told you I'm Mike Fink.

82
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,920
King of the River.
This is my private river.

83
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,823
Have you got room for
a couple of private passengers?

84
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,485
- Where you bound?
- Natchez.

85
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,529
We got furs we aim to sell down there.

86
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,464
You get a better price
for your furs in New Orleans.

87
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:43,093
Tell you what I'll do,
seeing as how it's you.

88
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:46,661
- I'll make you a special rate.
- That's nice of you.

89
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,505
Yes, you and your furs all the way
to Natchez or New Orleans,

90
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,476
for only $1,000 hard money.

91
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,810
Why, that's plain uncivilized piracy.

92
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,607
Ain't no question about it.

93
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,312
Make up your minds
and let me know before morning.

94
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,821
You keep me from my drinkin'.

95
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,048
$1,000?

96
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,958
Who does that big windbag
think he is?

97
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,928
Seems like he told us.

98
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:14,558
He might be the King of the River,
but he ain't got the only boat.

99
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,631
- Howdy there.
- Howdy.

100
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:24,733
This your boat?
Yep, Bertha Mae out of Marietta.

101
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:28,406
- Sounds like a racehorse.
- Hard to beat if she's handled right.

102
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,506
Which way you going?
Up river or down?

103
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:34,110
- Ain't going no place right now.
- Barrel's marked for New Orleans.

104
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:37,884
That's right.
But my crew up and deserted me.

105
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,790
- What'd they do that for?
- Heard about the Injuns.

106
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,920
Didn't know there was Injun trouble.

107
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:46,829
It ain't here.
Downriver somewhere.

108
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:51,131
Other side of Shawnee Town.
Red devils are attacking everything.

109
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:54,833
Flat boats loaded with settlers.
Even on the keelboats.

110
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,000
Got so bad, nobody'd sign on.

111
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,442
Don't seem to be scaring off
Mike Fink none.

112
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:03,846
Him and them Pittsburgh pole-pushers
ain't human enough to be scared.

113
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,714
We picked the wrong time
for a boat ride.

114
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,947
Hey.

115
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:12,650
- Are you really Davy Crockett?
- Why, sure.

116
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:16,361
- I'm Captain Cobb.
- This is my friend, Georgie Russel.

117
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:21,025
Glad to know ya. You fellas
got a reputation for Injun fightin'.

118
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,400
If folks knew you were going downriver
with me, we could get a crew.

119
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:28,872
- What do you think, Georgie?
- Beats paying $1,000 we ain't got.

120
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:33,275
- How many men would it take?
- Six, if they're as strong as you be.

121
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,645
If they don't know any more
about boating than Georgie and me,

122
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,707
it'll be some crew.

123
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,278
Better split up,
we're gonna cover the town.

124
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,652
Don't you be a'feared
of tootin' your horn.

125
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:48,592
Mind what you promise. Don't want
anybody to think this'll be a frolic.

126
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:55,557
That one's about the right size.
See you back at the landing.

127
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,302
[Grunts]

128
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,874
Ah!

129
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,715
[Jocko] Now, anybody else
don't care for my cigar?

130
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,991
Kind of handy with
them fists of yourn, ain't you?

131
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,263
Better at kicking and bitin'.

132
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,235
You're the kind of fella
I been looking for. Drink?

133
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:07,500
You're just the kind of fella
I've been looking for, too.

134
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,803
Well, here's mud in your eye.

135
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:20,549
Know something? Sleepy town like this
ain't no place for a man of your talents.

136
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,612
- Mister, that's a fact.
- Have another?

137
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,884
- What's your name?
- Jocko.

138
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,388
- Mine's Georgie.
- Well, I'm pleased to meet you.

139
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,332
Ah, it's kind of tasty, ain't it?

140
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,503
[Whispering] That'd grow whiskers...

141
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,309
That'd grow pink whiskers
on a hound dog.

142
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:53,512
Hey, Jocko, how'd you like to see
a little something of the world?

143
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:57,147
- What you driving at, Georgie?
- I'm gonna let you in on something.

144
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:01,125
Me and Davy Crockett is getting a party
to take a boat ride down the river.

145
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,855
- Take a what?
- Boat ride, on the Bertha Mae.

146
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:07,365
- Clean down to New Orleans.
- [Cackling]

147
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,128
What's so funny?

148
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:12,466
That's the gall-bustingest joke
I ever heard. Hey, Mike!

149
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:16,941
This clodhopper is trying to sign old Jocko
on the Bertha Mae.

150
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:25,342
You tired of livin'? Nobody tries
to steal one of Mike Fink's crew.

- But Injuns don't scare Davy none.

Our only trouble is,
we can't get a crew.

You ain't gonna find
no keelboatmen around here.

are crazy enough to join you,

you'll end up in a sandbar for sure.

You go look for him.
We'll find the rest of the fellas.

It may take persuading, but we'll
have a full crew before morning.

- To New Orleans.

Pretty late. Sure hope

if his pa'd let him waste a whiskey.

- Yeah.

What are you belly-aching about?
We're doing all the work.

457
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:05,049
Now I know exactly
how Noah must've felt.

458
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:13,789
Much obliged for all the trouble
I put you to.

459
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:16,094
That's my place yonder
on the bayou.

460
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:20,433
- Got time to break bread with us?
- We got some time to make up.

461
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,398
Excuse me, please.
I got to look after my critters.

462
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:31,112
I sure gotta hand it to you, Davy.
You just don't know when you're up.

463
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:33,342
Not everybody can come in first.

464
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:37,279
Maybe the good Lord
didn't intend for us to win this race.

465
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:40,688
Then what are we breaking our backs for
to get to New Orleans?

466
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:43,853
Got to deliver some furs to Mike Fink.

467
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:50,858
- So long. Sorry your boat's so big.
- What's the matter with the size?

468
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:56,497
If she was smaller, you could save
40 miles by takin' this here bayou.

469
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,636
I been down it in my skiff
plenty of times.

470
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:03,202
Runs back into the Mississippi
just above New Orleans.

471
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,906
Think we can get through?

472
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:09,646
Lt'd be a tight squeeze,
but if you cut a few trees out of the way,

473
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,814
and don't mind scraping the bottom,
you might make it.

474
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:17,292
Georgie, maybe we ain't
lost this race yet.

475

[Alligator growls]

476
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,810
We've practiced long enough.
Let's show 'em something.

477
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,359
Row them poles,
you scummy river rats!

478
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,731
If you don't get me to that landing
before Crockett,

479
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:35,169
so help me, I'll turn every mother's son
into catfish bait!

480
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:53,750
Push, boys!
Push like you never pushed before!

481
00:39:57,361 --> 00:40:00,091
We're beatin' 'em, boys! Push!

Give 'em the Pittsburgh punch!

484
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:17,873
Aah!

485
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,313
So you want to play rough?

486
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,822
Ah!

487
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,996
Give it to 'em, Jocko.

488
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,826
Give 'em what for, Davy.

489
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,065
Use that pole, man!

490
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:47,671
Hit 'em! Hit 'em!

You thought you was
gonna wear our pelts!

You thought we was
gonna be trailin'!

[Church bell ringing]

496

What's the world gonna say?

497

Mike Fink, King of the River,
losin' to a pack of landlubbers.

498
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:06,516
We don't want anything but our furs.
That's all we started out to do.

499
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:10,185
You mean, you ain't gonna
lay claim to my red feather?

500
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:12,058
There's only one King of the River.

501
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:16,998
That bayou we come through ain't rightly
a part of the Mississip.

502
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,497
Where's my hat?

503
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:25,166
* They were darn good friends
From that day on

504
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:28,541
* Davy sold his furs
And then was gone

505
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:32,070
* Sailin' north with Mike
To the land of the fawn

506
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:36,516
* Where a man could live
By brain and brawn

Put your backs into it.
What do you think this is, a free trip?

516
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:15,925
You ungrateful pole cat, we dragged
this tub all the way from New Orleans.

517
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:20,886
I gotta admit, for a couple backwoods
bar hunters, you ain't done bad.

518
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:23,297
Those are kind words
coming from you, Mike.

519
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,927
You could put us ashore
any place along here.

520
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:33,305
I can't see why you bristleheaded varmints

521
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:36,278
can't land at a settlement
like civilized passengers.

522

He works the tar out of us
and calls us "passengers."

523
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:43,644
- It's the quickest way to get home.
- Sounds like a long walk to me.

524
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:46,747
We're gonna get some horses
and sit down for a change.

525
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:50,624
Where are you gonna find horses
in a lonesome place like this?

526
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:53,959
Chickasaws. This is their country
and they're friendly.

527
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:12,980
Been a pleasure knowing you, Mike.

528
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,883
I ain't likely to forget you two, neither.

535
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,473
We figured you needed something

536

to protect you against them
redskin pirates upriver.

537

Don't reckon I'll need her for that.
But she'll come in handy

538

nobody thinkin' you still wasn't king.

Never was no danger of that.

to be river men again, look me up.

Not a sound. Not a bird or a squirrel.

They ain't huntin' us. Let's find them.

Mind your manners, Georgie.
This is the chief.

They're up on the Ohio
around Cave-ln Rock.

No wonder, they've been attacking

[Spits] They are white.
They hear only white man's lies.

This ain't something we heard.
We seen it, didn't we?

- Sure did.
- When?

596
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:16,411
- Not more than three months ago.
- We broke up a raid below the big cave.

00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,708
More lies.

598
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:21,842
Three moons ago my people were driven
from the river by the white man.

599
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:26,355
- Must have been some other tribe.
- There are no other red men here.

600
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:29,517
- We have always kept the peace.
- I believe you.

601
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:32,926
- Know what this means?
- Could mean some white skunks

602
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,794
are dressing up like Indians
so they get the blame.

603

We're going to find out who they are.

604
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:40,699
You say you know me.

605
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:43,329
Then you know
Davy Crockett's word is good.

606
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:45,739
We'll chase those varmints

What you doing, Mason?
Smokin' up a new batch?

- Won't keep if I don't.
- You got your mattress stuffed.

The Harpes just come in.

Yeah.

This waiting's making me nervous.
Time's getting short.

- That moon was half full last night.
- We still got a few days.

780

It'll take a few days
to get word back to Chickasaw.

Reckon we ain't got long to wait.

My boys is ready.
Full of fighting and itching to get at 'em.

Not so loud.
Don't want Colonel Plug to hear.

- He's still sleeping.
- Better make sure.

Davy Crockett?

796

Oh, excuse me, boys. I was having
a little difficulty getting to sleep.

797
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:17,377
I thought you might like to hear
a little music.

There's a cannon instead

But what's he singing about this time?

If I'd knowed I'd have to tote this thing,
I'd have argued for a pistol.

Hey, Moose.

Get my powder and canoe in the water.

Somebody's playing awful rough.

01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:14,091
That's Sam Mason and the
Harpe brothers. The orneriest skunks.

- They're getting away!
- No, they ain't.

835

You take the rest of them in.
Georgie'll run them varmints down.

Boot tracks.
They're the ones we want.

Big Harpe, stay here and keep watch.

838
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:50,133
- Wait a minute, what about my share?
- You'll get what's coming to you.

839
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:24,539
Leave that big stuff.
We can't carry that on horseback.

840
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:37,642
- That's enough.
- We can't leave this for somebody else.

01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,984
Nobody's going to find it
till we get back.

- Get out of sight.

Don't think it ever was
a tavern, Georgie.

You mean this is their hang out?

- It's gotta be.
- You ain't going in there?

Them varmints went someplace.

849

- What was you muttering about?

Same kind we found sticking
in that wrecked keelboat.

855
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:19,810
Here's where they changed into Injuns.

856
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:26,251
Them three that we followed
in here must be the ringleaders.

857
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:42,528
Stay here and I'll see
if I can smoke something out.

858
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,673
Hey, Davy,
what's keeping you?

859
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,174
Plenty of loot in there.

860
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:31,878
They wouldn't go off and leave it.
Reckon they're still around.

861
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:55,942
This ought to lead to something
mighty interesting.

I'm still King of the River.

You're a first-class friend.
