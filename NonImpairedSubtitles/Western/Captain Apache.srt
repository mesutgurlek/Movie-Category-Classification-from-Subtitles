'' Love Thy Neighbor ''

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,198
Source forgotten.

3
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,149
CAPTAIN APACHE

4
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,913
OFFICE OF THE COMMISIONER

5
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,629
Ain't you off the reservation,
red ass?

6
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,590
I'm afraid I have to leave now.

7
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,556
Forgive me for it.

8
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,276
You dropped this coin on your way in, Sir.

9
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,276
What are we doing in the reservation?

10
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,068
This is where it happened.

11
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,870
I didn't do it!

12
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,791
I was only accompanying the commissioner
back to the reservation

13
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,797
It happened so fast...

14
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,956
I didn't know where the fire came from.

15
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,356
They attacked him right in the back.

16
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,158
He tried to say something.

17
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,359
April Morning...

18
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,597
Then I saw the Indians.

19
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,997
I knew it wasn't them who did it.

20
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,513
They loved that old man.

21
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,473
Mr. Collier was...
he was like a father to them.

22
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,831
All the things he did for them.

23
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,396
He was like a father to everyone,
even to me.

24
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,119
What are you gonna do with me?

25
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,192
Why did you bring me here?

26
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,712
You were with him when he died.
What did he say?

27
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,719
April Morning.

28
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,717
Then why are you so scared?

29
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,111
You're a crazy Indian!

30
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,559
He tried to tell us something.
What did he mean?

31
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,154
I told you...
I don't know!

32
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,309
Well then find out!
By tomorrow.

33
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,915
Mr. Griffin, we've been waiting
impatiently for you

34
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,274
Show the lieutenant!

35
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,277
The general will be pleased.

36
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,120
- Where is His Excellency?
- This way.

37
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,633
Come, fools,
gather the guns!

38
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,155
Come!

39
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,197
Welcome, Mr. Griffin.

40
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,755
Welcome.

41
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,239
Your Excellency.

42
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,432
Mr. Griffin has delivered
the rifles, my general.

43
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,990
Sit down, Mr. Griffin.
Sit down.

44
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,829
You are a man of your word, Sir.

45
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,272
Tell me are you, general, to be
a man of your word, too.

46
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,872
Many years ago...

47
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,078
... I promised my mother
that one day...

48
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,433
... it would become governor
of this province.

49
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,679
With your guns...

50
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,959
... I will keep that promise.

51
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,551
Before doing that general...

52
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,189
Try to remember the promise you made to me!

53
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,033
Lieutenant, what was it
we promised Mr. Griffin?

54
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,349
Now you don't have to ask him,
you just take a moment and think.

55
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,238
Patience, Sir.

56
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,999
I'm thinking!

57
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,469
You made that promise to me
only a month ago.

58
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,956
You have no trouble remembering

59
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,554
a promise you made to your mother
many years ago.

60
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,189
A son's promise to his dying mother
is something sacred.

61
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,113
To forget would anger God.

62
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,957
Your Excellency,
God is in heaven.

63
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,554
I am here.

64
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,157
And I'm getting very angry.

65
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,239
You are blaspheme, Sir.

66
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,676
Now you take a moment and try
to remember, Your Excellency.

67
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,190
I remember nothing!

68
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,432
Then I'm leaving...

69
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,035
... and I'm taking my guns.

70
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,071
The guns are staying...

71
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,959
... and you are not leaving.

72
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,989
You want it all, don't you?

73
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,753
I have it all.

74
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,035
I have a hundred men
and you have six.

75
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,553
Seven!

76
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,871
Lieutenant, you said they were
six with him altogether.

77
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,913
Oh it's nothing!

78
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,750
We are just getting a new general.

79
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,392
I'm gonna send you
more ammunition.

80
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,236
Bury him next to his mother.

81
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,155
You two, come!

82
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,550
Now you remember what to do
and when.

83
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,872
I'll cross the border in time
...for April Morning.

84
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,316
O.J., what you are doing? 

85
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,312
I want It now!

86
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,518
Hit him again, O.J.

87
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,397
What does April Morning mean?

88
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,229
I don't know!

89
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,071
I only got till tomorrow.

90
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,951
One of you better come up with the answer!

91
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,148
How many lumps?

92
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,599
We should have killed him this morning.

93
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,637
He's only one man,
a lousy apache.

94
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,798
All right. You get him.
Get him!

95
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,673
You relax, O.J.

96
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,630
You'll have his scalp
for breakfast.

97
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,475
I hope you don't think I was too forward

98
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,915
... asking you to have dinner with me, captain.

99
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,837
- Not al all.
- I don't know what's come over me...

100
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,070
... I never speak to strangers.

101
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,350
- I'm sure.
- I come from a very

102
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,748
... strict family.

103
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,719
- Ah, yes?
- I never even kissed...

104
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,155
... a boy until I got my degree...

105
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,958
... in the finishing school.

106
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,469
Is that so?

107
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,358
The only reason I came out west...

108
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,751
... was to study the Indians,
savages fascinate me.

109
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,595
- How?
- The Indians are the only people
with truly strict morality.

110
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,469
That I think.

111
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,028
The behavior of the white man
is disgraceful.

112
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,754
- Especially toward women.
- So I heard.

113
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,912
It wouldn't consider marrying a man...

114
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,071
... who didn't treat a woman
with the upmost respect.

115
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,389
You shouldn't.

116
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,917
My mother taught me one thing:

117
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,833
No man respects a women
who doesn't respect herself.

118
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,035
It is certain.

119
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,952
Now you wouldn't want the mother
of your children...

120
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,588
... to be any other way?
- Absolutely not.

121
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,712
When I marry,
It's going to be for ever and ever.

122
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,108
Oh, me too.

123
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,915
I believe that a woman can have
only one great love in her life.

124
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,274
That's true.

125
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,956
Some where, some place there is
the right man for me.

126
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,348
That's good.

127
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,753
And until that day
you see me as I am...

128
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,195
... lovely and untouched.

129
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,672
Ok, red ass...

130
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,070
... what's so important
about April Morning?

131
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,272
That's what I'm trying to find out.

132
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,793
Why?

133
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,477
Take it easy, lady,...

134
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,436
... I don't wanna blow your brains out.

135
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,798
You're no gentleman.

136
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,036
A savage likes to be sociably unpredictable.

137
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,709
Suicide.

138
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,073
He must have had a hell of a time
trying to make up his mind.

139
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,634
- You do it?
- Me?

140
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,631
A person like me
wouldn't do a thing like that.

141
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,120
It was another feller...

142
00:13:58,121 --> 00:13:59,951
He was like a father to me.

143
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,637
What was he to you?

144
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,673
Looks like you've got a lot of
things to find out.

145
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,159
Don't make me do it..

146
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,679
All I can tell you is once a month

147
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,798
... O.J. rode across the border
to meet somebody.

148
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,792
- Who?
- I do not know.

149
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,355
- Where?
- El Lobo,...

150
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,755
... a cantina.

151
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,958
I'll be back.

152
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,830
Welcome to Mexico,
Captain Apache!

153
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,229
How do you know who I am?

154
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,239
I'm a witch, I know everything.

155
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,549
Then tell me why I'm here?

156
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,918
What you're looking for
is not here.

157
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,508
Why are they dead?

158
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,237
So there will be no witnesses
to tell about your death.

159
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,313
You're late, sergeant.

160
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,791
We ride into the border patrol, Sir.

161
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,712
We had to take a detour.

162
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,956
Having trouble?

163
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,519
Somebody stolled my horse.

164
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,073
There's a live one, Sir.

165
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,240
Bring him in sergeant, post
the rest of your men around here.

166
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,319
Who owns this place?

167
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,833
I do.

168
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,473
Why would they set up?

169
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,193
Don't answer him!

170
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,910
I told you not to take the money!

171
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,470
I told you it will come to no good.

172
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,473
I did it for you.

173
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,115
Now I am a widow again.

174
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,234
- You won't be for long.
- Are you interested?

175
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,871
Then wait until after the funeral.

176
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,679
- Should we take her, Sir?
- Sergeant,...

177
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,798
... have you no respect?

178
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,310
Can't you see this poor woman
it out of her mind with grief?

179
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,193
lndian, son of a bitch!

180
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,070
Nice for keeping an eye on her,
sergeant.

181
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,873
Put your shoes on.

182
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,150
- Where are we going?
- Your late husband worked...

183
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,117
... for a man called Rodriguez.

184
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,118
- What do you want?
- I wanna meet this Rodriguez.

185
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,237
You are not more than...
- Sergeant,...

186
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,600
... help the lady find her shoes.

187
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,300
- ...a damn excrement Indian!
- Sir.

188
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,437
- Get off my land!
- Are you sure you don't wanna sell?

189
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,268
This land is mine.
I worked it...

190
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,199
... with my own two hands...

191
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,638
Why didn't you let him finish?

192
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,031
They all say the same thing.

193
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,833
Howdy, Mr. Griffin.

194
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,791
I see we've made a deal.

195
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,111
Ma'am,...

196
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,513
... I don't want you to think that 
I've stolen this land from your husband.

197
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,869
When I said I made a deal, I meant it.

198
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,550
You're gonna get all the nice things
that this poor man...

199 
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,836
... could only dream of giving you.

200
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,274
You are completely wasted out here
in this wilderness.

201
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,709
You should be surrounded by lovely things.

202
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,919
Like red flush,
crystal chandeliers,...

203
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,839
... rustling silk,
french perfume,...

204
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,311
... laughter, music,
the clink of gold coin...

205
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,152
You pack up her stuff, Moon.

206
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,518
Then you tell Beller to fix up a room for the

207
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,353
lovely lady at the Paradise hotel.

208
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,029
Ma'am.

209
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,914
Carlos!

210
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,309
Carlos!

211
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,235
Apache!

212
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,954
Is that Rodriguez?

213
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,598
No, but he can tell you where he is.

214
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,072
Well Captain, what's an American officer
doing here?

215
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,310
I have a warrant to extradite a man
wanted in the United States.

216
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,710
His name is Rodriguez.

217
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,633
Rodriguez, the man
who sells guns to the Indians.

218
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,473
He's a very bad man.

219
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,200
- It's here, isnt't it?
- He's inside the church.

220
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,794
Go away!

221
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,318
I came for Rodriguez!

222
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,479
Rodriguez is in his sanctuary!
Go!

223
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,232
I just wanna talk to him.

224
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,392
You see, captain?

225
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,793
Our priest is a very stubborn man.

226
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,594
So am I.

227
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,198
Make youself at home, captain.

228
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,074
Enjoy the freshment of our pueblo.

229
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,432
Thank you, sergeant, I will.

230
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,479
Why did you bring him here?

231
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,837
I couldn't get rid of him.

232
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,714
And...

233
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,670
I wanted...

234
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,348
... to be with you.

235
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,514
How's business?

236
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,995
Can't complain..

237
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,159
- When is the funeral?
- They're waiting for me.

238
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,956
How'd you like to have this?

239
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,193
- I take it.
- For who?

240
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,509
For me.

241
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,950
Ten of these and your funeral
will be the talk of the town.

242
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,072
- Go away.
- It's time for the services padre.

243
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,071
- It's too early.
- And what do you want me to do,

244
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,355
take him back?

245
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,077
It's the Captain Apache.

246
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,038
The apache's in the coffin.

247
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,352
- So give him Christian burial.
- I'll sound the bells.

248
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,637
'' ln name Patris,
ET Fili, ET Spiritus Sancti ''.

249
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,268
Amen.

250
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,470
You can sure put him away fast, padre.

251
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,029
- Where is Rosita?
- Where is Rodriguez?

252
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,199
Just a second, padre!

253
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,113
I don't think you're hiding from Rodriguez.

254
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,910
I don't even think you are a priest.

255
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,232
Your Latin is lousy, Rodriguez.

256
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,390
- Who did I bury?
- Rodriguez,...

257
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,115
... why was commissioner Collier killed?

258
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,398
It's just a few minutes of air
left in that box.

259
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,830
Collier was killed because it found out
about April Morning.

260
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,192
What about April Morning?

261
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,513
I never took my vows,... 

262
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,079
... but it wouldn't lie on the Bible.

263
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,196
All I know is that my job is to buy
guns for the Indians!

264
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,789
All right.

265
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,550
You better go unbury that coffin.

266
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,758
Open it, open it, hurry!

267
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,114
You idiot!

268
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,279
Chief Diablo.

269
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,835
You are not ready to speak to us...

270
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,309
... in that uniform of our enemy.

271
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,838
Damn it! Do I have to go through this...

272
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,877
... every time I talk to an Indian?

273
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,353
Can we talk now?

274
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,758
- What do you want?
- You were there when Collier was killed?

275
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,949
We carried him into the reservation.

276
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,198
We discovered two bullet holes in his chest.

277
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,950
We buried it as he wished,...

278
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,675
... among our people.
- Who killed him?

279
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,991
I saw nothing,
I heard only the bullets.

280
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,271
If you where innocent, then why do
you people hide in the mountains?

281
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,037
Collier was my friend.

282
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,510
When he lived,
we were not afraid.

283
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,478
What did his last words mean?

284
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,917
April Morning,
no one knows the meaning.

285
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,160
You will not leave to betray our hiding place.

286
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,999
Let him go!

287
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,672
You ain't said a word yet, red ass.

288
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,956
Yea, ain't you grateful to us...

289
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,709
... for rescuing you from them bad Indians?

290
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,552
Fire water is good.

291
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,190
Here the skin is not burned.

292
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,869
Leave me single.

293
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,479
Hey you boys,
take the bottle with you.

294
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,518
I suppose I have you to thank.

295
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,798
It'll let you to answer
one question for me.

296
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,193
April Morning.

297
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,796
Do I have to repeat it, captain?

298
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,198
No, Sir, I heard you.

299
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,359
What do you know about it?

300
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,518
There is a live one coming around, Mr. Griffin

301
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,672
You wouldn't want that gun to go off
with all these people here?

302
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,478
They wouldn't notice a thing.

303
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,320
Once they work for me,
are in debt to me.

304
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,359
Suppose I help you carry out your orders.

305
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,075
- You know my orders?
- To the letter.

306
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,471
You also own the telegraph?

307
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,912
I have many friends.

308
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,359
And you know the killers
of commissioner Collier?

309
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,952
They're sitting right behind you.

310
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,473
Moon and Snake.

311
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,070
They're like brothers to me,
devoted, loyal,...

312
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,517
... and completely selfless
in the pursuit of my interests.

313
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,148
But for their thoughtless crime...
murdering Collier...

314
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,670
I'm prepared to turn them over to justice.

315
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,158
The court's gotta believe it.

316
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,468
I'll provide you with eye witnesses...

317
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,190
... even a voluntary confession.

318
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,949
Now I guarantee you a jury
that will convict them.

319
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,473
And if necessary,...

320
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,838
... I'll even hang them
from my own balcony.

321
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,629
Is it a deal?

322
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,393
I just wanna hang the man
that hired them.

323
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,994
What date is today?

324
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,192
It's two days to April.

325
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,833
Well that doesn't give me much time,
does it?

326
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,432
Now what do you say to a partnership,
captain?

327
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,270
Whaterver you find out
about April Morning, you tell me...

328
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,476
... whaterver I find out - I'll tell you

329
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,559
Working together maybe we can get
down at the bottom of all this.

330
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,196
We ain't gonna find the answers
sitting here.

331
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,830
Spoken like a man of action.

332
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,678
I'll trouble you for my gun.

333
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,878
Well certainly, partner.

334
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,711
Now let's go to your office.

335
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,353
They don't look like killers to me,
they look more like chicken thieves.

336
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,838
Are you looking for something?

337
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,669
Yes.

338
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,075
What?

339
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,114
I don't know.

340
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,758
It's surprising what you can turn up

341
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,797
if you just keep looking.

342
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,994
- Locked.
- Safes usually are.

343
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,869
I don't suppose you remember
the combination.

344
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,832
Never had a head for figures.

345
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,718
Well I just happen to have
the right combination with me.

346
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,993
- May I have a light, Mr. Griffin?
- Please do.

347
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,949
Thank you.

348
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,717
How is your tea, captain?

349
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,479
Fine, thanks.

350
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,516
Did you know that the captain here...

351
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,517
... is graduate at West Point?

352
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,873
Really?

353
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,354
Cookie captain?

354
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,319
Made by Maria.

355
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,795
No, thanks,
I don't eat cookies.

356
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,069
Sorry.

357
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,959
Let me out!

358
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,791
You mean it was never even locked!

359
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,193
- That figures.
- The house always has the edge.

360
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,710
You dirty bastards!

361
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,870
Where is your sheriff?

362
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,394
I wanna deliver him these two indians.

363
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,396
Looks like this town's got no proper lawman.

364
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,788
That's all right.

365
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,352
I'll hang them myself!

366
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,358
Hold it then, just hold it!

367
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,868
What for?

368
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,678
We got a law in this tawn.

369
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,080
And I don't think the captain there
would take too kindly you

370
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,514
... hanging a couple of Indians.

371
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,917
Him the law, that red ass?

372
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,474
You better be careful what you say,
stranger.

373
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,149
The captain there is a very dangerous man.

374
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,872
The name is J.P. Soms.

375
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,476
And I ain't afraid of nobody.

376
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,990
That's the spirit, Mr. Soms.

377
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,640
Real true pioneering spirit.

378
00:38:34,641 --> 00:38:37,393
For that, I'm gonna give you the privilege...

379
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,391
... of whacking my horse.

380
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,428
Well, captain,...

381
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,556
... are you gonna let
this man break the law?

382
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,188
Seems to me no law has been broken,
Mr. Griffin...

383
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,472
... not until you whack that horse.

384
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,956
Well let's get on with the hanging.

385
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,118
I didn't come all the way from Tucson...

386
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,470
... just to get mixed up in legal disputes.

387
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,757
- What's that?
- What's what?

388
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,878
You come all the way from Tucson.
Why?

389
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,517
I got the word.

390
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,395
What word?

391
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,076
April Morning.

392
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,709
Where did you hear that?

393
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,790
Is none of your damn business!

394
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,473
This April Morning,...

395
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,149
... why did that bring you here?

396
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,113
I don't have to tell you neither, red ass!

397
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,198
That's right, Mr. Soms,...

398
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,796
... you don't have to answer that man's question.

399
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,191
I'll talk to anybody I damn please!

400
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,118
Well you're not gonna talk to anybody!

401
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,833
Don't touch me!

402
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,473
Don't touch me!

403
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,399
Nice shooting,
two bullets right in the heart.

404
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,476
Are you alone?

405
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,237
I think you were expected.

406
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,158
- Someone following you?
- No, no, no.

407
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,272
Stay away from the window!

408
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,909
This is important.

409
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,158
- There's something you don't know.
- Why tell me?

410
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,033
You're the only honest man in town.

411
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,479
What gave you religion?

412
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,397
No, I don't wanna die!

413
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,312
That's why I came here.

414
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,110
- Who wants to kill you?
- I don't know.

415
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,273
Somebody told me,
it said to me that...

416
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,471
... my days are numbered.
I'm a marked man!

417
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,073
I need help, captain!

418
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,714
If you don't come to the point,
I'm gonna kill you myself.

419
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,399
All right, all right, I'll tell you, but...

420
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,509
... you gotta promise protect me...

421
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,955
Hey, all right.

422
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,276
Do you know why that Mr. Soms
came all the way here from Tucson?

423
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,515
Tell me.

424
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,153
Can't be too careful.

425
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,079
Damn it!

426
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,837
- Who is there?
- Maude.

427
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,508
Just a minute!

428
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,713
Coming!

429
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,548
You alone?

430
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,469
I am.

431
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,069
Come on in.

432
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,272
Sit down and stay away from the door.

433
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,997
And stay away from the window.

434
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,752
Shall I turn the lights donw?

435
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,273
Don't rush it.

436
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,030
You want some champagne first?

437
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,799
Oh, be nice.

438
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,479
Listen to it.

439
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,757
I love music,
I'd love to dance.

440
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,637
It's a little crowded in here.

441
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,354
We can manage.

442
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,471
You're so light on your feet!

443
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,074
It's the spirit that dances,
not the man,...

444
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,073
... Indian proverb.

445
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,355
- Are we waiting for someone?
- Why?

446
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,593
I believe he's already here.

447
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,874
Look!

448
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,479
Who did it?

449
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,349
Now who'd wanna kill
a nice happy man of law?

450
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,233
That does it!
I'm gonna let you in on something.

451
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,750
Lucsanco, he's the telegraph operator,...

452
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,956
... he has a direct wire to Tucson.

453
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,997
He sent for Mr. Soms.

454
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,508
What are you doing here?

455
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,830
I've come for a lesson.

456
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,396
Well it's late.
Can't you wait till tomorrow morning?

457
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,152
April's only a few days.

458
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,192
There's ain't much time, Freddy!

459
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,152
Stop it, Moon, that key's alive,
practice on that one.

460
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,472
What town is that key to?

461
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,068
What's the difference?

462
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,270
Well, it wouldn't be Tucson, would it?

463
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,630
Wouldn't be you sent for Mister
Soms, would it?

464
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,512
The lesson's over, Moon.

465
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,034
 

466
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,872
You're a dead man, Freddy.

467
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,514
Hey,

468
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,032
What are you doing out so late, captain?

469
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,317
- I'd thought I'd send a telegram.
- Yea, write a letter, get that first.

470
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,434
Righ over there.

471
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,399
Take off your coat.

472
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,153
Get over there.

473
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,510
Pick up that stool and sit down.

474
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,919
Hey Snake,...

475
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,991
... have you ever seen a red ass
in a blue uniform before?

476
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,235
Tell me,...

477
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,473
... general,...

478
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,557
... do the other officers
let you eat with them?

479
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,036
They bring him right into their homes,
don't they, red ass?

480
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,559
Do those fancy white ladies
ever say hello to you?

481
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,357
Oh, what's the matter?

482
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,672
We hit you where it hurts?

483
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,758
Now you think you're the only one?

484
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,354
We've been eating trap for as long as you!

485
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,755
We've been kicked aroud from the
cradle long.

486
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,473
Now, you been an Indian,
you know what it feels like.

487
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,558
Come on...

488
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,553
... we all three,
are brothers under the skin.

489
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,711
That still don't make him one of us.

490
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,874
What do you want of?

491
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,191
Well, we used to be Griffin's boys,...

492
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,038
... but no more, we are in
business for our selves.

493
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:17,388
And we are offering to
make you a full partner.

494
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,670
Of what?

495
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,511
One third of April Morning.

496
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,914
It's a deal.

497
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,359
Partner,...

498
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,354
... now let's put the pieces together.

499
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,795
From what you know
and from what we know...

500
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,190
... we should walk away
with the whole thing.

501
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,715
- What do you know?
- First tell us what you know!

502
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,357
Every time I get a lean on April Morning,
somebody gets killed.

503
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,589
And?

504
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,079
That's all.

505
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,473
I'm no further than where I started.

506
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,392
All right, red ass,...

507
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,471
... you wanna play tough Indian.

508
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,634
Get her it here.

509
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,473
Get her it here!

510
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,071
- You... still alive?
- Shut up and mix the stuff!

511
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,669
Come on.

512
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,751
You're gonna drink this.

513
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,636
- Drink!
- Don't spill a drop!

514
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,075
How do you feel?

515
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,233
Too much for him.

516
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,953
Right in the back.

517
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:34,956
In the back.

518
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,474
In his chest.

519
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,389
In chest.

520
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,840
The back, the chest.

521
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,709
The back, the chest.

522
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,192
I know who killed Collier.

523
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,357
Who cares?
What about April Morning?

524
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,669
What's that?

525
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,796
What about April Morning?

526
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,753
I am burning!
Snake, get off me!

527
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,875
He knows! He knows who killed Collier!

528
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,149
Snake!

529
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,635
Are you up there?

530
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,989
If you kill everyone who had
anything to do with Collier,...

531
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,992
... how are you gonna prove anything?

532
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,514
They didn't do it,
but I know who did.

533
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,508
And I'll trouble you for my gun.

534
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,759
Who did?

535
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,354
O.J.'s deputies.

536
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,671
Where is Sanchez?
We've got to see him.

537
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,991
- The general is...
- Tell him we want to see him.

538
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,469
It's very important. Muy importante.

539
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,916
Have you got the bulke,
you old fool?

540
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,437
Enough for all your banditos
to get drunk for a month.

541
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,637
Open the door!

542
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,635
What are you doing here?

543
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,711
That apache captain
knows we killed Collier.

544
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,317
- Does he know why Collier was killed?
- No.

545
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,390
- Did he followed you here?
- Nobody saw us coming.

546
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,517
Yes, but he's looking for us.

547
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,749
My connection with this
must never be known.

548
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,399
He only knows about us, you know.

549
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,317
- You gotta hide us.
- Or he will find us.

550
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,151
And when he does, you'll talk.

551
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,589
- That's why you'd better hide us.
- Yes, you have to hide us.

552
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,274
Hide them.

553
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,232
We move out tomorrow!

554
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:49,829
No drinking tonight.
Destroy those barrels.

555
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,677
Always keep a table for you, Sir.

556
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,273
Friend...!

557
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,839
Good to see you.

558
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,760
You going somewhere, mister?

559
00:58:44,761 --> 00:58:47,069
Why don't you let him out
in the sun once in a while?

560
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,314
Repeat that.

561
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,356
Oh freak clown face, sit down!

562
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,352
Hold on, Mister.

563
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,790
Didn't I just tell you to sit down?

564
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:00,756
That was my brother and
I don't take it likely.

565
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,276
Freaks like you come in pairs?

566
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:13,197
Didn't my boys make it clear
that you're intruding?

567
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,955
Keep your freaks away from me.

568
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,795
Why do you always insult
pople who might kill you?

569
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,076
I like to see a man enjoy his work.

570
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,752
Someone seems to be missing.

571
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,192
If you're looking for Maude,
she's getting married.

572
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,069
To who?

573
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,959
To me.

574
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,074
I wonder if you know
a Mexican bandit...

575
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,559
... who calls himself a General.

576
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,191
I don't believe I know any bandit...

577
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,312
... of any nationality.

578
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:54,915
Name is Sanchez.

579
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,551
You're at the wrong table captain,...

580
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,870
... the wrong hotel and the wrong town.

581
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,110
And you might even be
in the wrong line of business.

582
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,516
Now if you'll excuse me,
my food is getting cold.

583
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,390
What's Sanchez got to do with
April Morning, Griffin?

584
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,389
Captain!

585
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,788
General!

586
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,549
I came all the way down here to
give you my personal congratulations.

587
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,517
- Congratulations!
- Thank you, sir. But what for?

588
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,912
No false modesty, captain.
Damn fine job...

589
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,877
... of getting Collier's murderers.

590
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,151
- How did you know?
- It's all in this telegram...

591
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,356
... you sent me.
It's all true, isn't it?

592
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:38,716
Yes.

593
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,511
General, tomorrow is April.

594
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,512
Yes, yes. So, so?

595
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,480
So we still don't know the meaning of
Collier's last words.

596
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,870
Oh, don't worry about that captain.

597
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,792
We've plenty of men working on it.

598
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,439
Take a 30 day leave, you deserve it.

599
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,360
And it's liable to be a
promotion in this for you.

600
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,679
Thank you, Sir.

601
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,157
You sent nice telegrams.

602
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,596
I might make a general out of you yet.

603
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:17,157
- Where are you going on your vacation?
- I'm staying right here.

604
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,399
In this dull town?

605
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,230
I don't have any friends anywhere else.

606
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,712
You don't have any friends here.

607
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,193
Who's funeral?

608
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,276
It's that Mr. Soms,
the man from Tucson.

609
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:53,034
You came all the way from Tucson, why?

610
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,519
I got the word,...

611
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,912
... April Morning.

612
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,314
Thanks.

613
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,830
This office has been closed
by Headquarters, Sir.

614
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,078
Captain, you can't go on those files.

615
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,958
Pay attention to your key, soldier.

616
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,073
But you can't.

617
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:35,318
I warn you Sir, I have my orders.

618
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,068
Don't do that.

619
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,110
It's ok.

620
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,278
I'll take care of this.

621
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,189
Can I help you, captain?

622
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,874
I'm looking for your Tucson file, sergeant.

623
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,676
Oh you know, if it was up to me,...

624
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,353
... but those files are private.

625
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,749
Then, it'll be just between the two of us. 

626
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,678
- We'll just forget about all this, Billy.
- Right, sergeant.

627
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:16,188
Did you find what you were looking for?

628
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,629
Yes.

629
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,554
It's in your pocket.

630
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,508
Oh my.

631
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,194
Thank you.

632
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:50,079
Shut the door.

633
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,712
And take your hat off.

634
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,794
Celebrating your engagement
to Mr. Griffin?

635
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:02,030
Well, the wedding is not until June.

636
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,474
Well, if I'm in the neighbourhood,
I'll be there.

637
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:11,669
We were thinking of asking you
to be the best man.

638
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:14,400
As a matter of fact, Mr. Griffin
mentioned it last night.

639
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,593
Is that for me?

640
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,793
Mr. Griffin?
Doesn't he got a first name?

641
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,355
- Well who is it from?
- There's no signature.

642
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,472
What... what does it says?

643
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,514
April Morning, on schedule.

644
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,510
- Now what is that mean?
- How should I know?

645
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:37,033
- It's addressed to you!
- So help me.

646
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,669
You know?

647
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,069
I believe you.

648
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:46,071
If you were to receive this,...

649
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,718
... who'd you show it to?

650
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,317
Mr. Griffin, I guess.

651
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,589
Ok.

652
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,111
You shamed us, Mister.

653
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,596
We want satisfaction.

654
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,590
I don't fight with freaks.

655
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,758
Now, now that you ain't a captain no more,

656
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,479
... maybe you can drink with us freaks.

657
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:06,193
It sure was nice of him to
invite us.

658
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,679
- Wasn't it Ben?
- I misjudged him.

659
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,917
He's really a nice feller.

660
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,197
My brother is waiting.

661
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,759
Bottoms up?

662
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,754
My brother is waiting.

663
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,799
Bottoms up.

664
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,038
I do like a man who takes time out...

665
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,792
... for a friedly drink.

666
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:05,711
Bottoms up.

667
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:09,512
You ain't going to be unfriendly
now, are you?

668
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,678
You boys aren't keeping up with me.

669
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:15,152
I'm drinking two to your one.

670
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:19,399
Brothers, what happens to Ben,
happens to me.

671
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,274
Drink.

672
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:29,909
All way.

673
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,230
I'd better not.

674
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,831
You'd better not offend my brother.

675
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:40,953
I'm an Indian.

676
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,031
One more and I go crazy.

677
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,354
Drink it.

678
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,068
Let's see.

679
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,194
Ok.

680
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,154
Watch.

681
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,357
Those boys cost me a fortune.

682
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:32,959
You ruined them.

683
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,399
Why are you still here?

684
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,199
Where should I be?

685
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,394
Well, your fiancée just left town
with a traveling bag.

686
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:47,190
- Doesn't that mean something to you?
- Well she's always doing that.

687
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,477
But she always comes back to me.

688
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:53,074
Now that I'm best man I wanna
make sure this wedding comes off.

689
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,789
Let's go.

690
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,918
We don't have to do this,
I can tell you where she went.

691
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,753
She went to catch a train in that Colida.

692
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,510
Where is she headed?

693
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,954
Tucson, to buy herself a trousseau.

694
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,512
Well, I need a new uniform.

695
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,477
Let's all go shopping together.

696
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,679
All right.

697
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,792
There are plenty of seats in the car.

698
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,757
The lady and I would like a little...

699
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,674
... privacy.

700
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:56,195
You're sitting with my fiancée.

701
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,596
- What?
- Mr. Griffin and I...

702
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,113
... are engaged to be married.

703
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,712
- What does that make us?
- We're lovers.

704
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:07,679
Cut it.

705
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:08,835
What are you doing here sergeant?

706
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:12,039
- Official business.
- Let me see your travelers.

707
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,238
I asked for a change of station.

708
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,477
I can't get along with my superior officer.

709
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:21,480
- How'd you meet her?
- That's my question.

710
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:23,914
How did you?

711
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:26,388
She came to send a telegram.

712
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:29,875
In answer to this?

713
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,672
The captain doesn't seem to understand.

714
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:34,109
The telegrams are privilege
communications.

715
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,713
Oh I don't mind telling him.

716
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:38,155
It warned my dressmaker
I'd be there tomorrow.

717
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:41,392
So we're all gonna be
on this train April first.

718
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,320
Still convinced...

719
01:10:44,321 --> 01:10:46,311
... that something awful is going
to happen April the first?

720
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,151
Isn't it?

721
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:00,277
- Hey! I'm sorry you followed me.
- Why?

722
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,277
I don't want you to think badly of me.

723
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,635
You always keep walking in on me
at the wrong time.

724
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,358
Is there ever a right time?

725
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,592
There was a right time for us once.

726
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,271
There's been a lot of boots
under your bed since.

727
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:14,990
It's your own fault, you never
gave me any encouragement.

728
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,988
I got a little discourage when I saw
O.J. hanging from the ceiling.

729
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,751
I had nothing to do with that!

730
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,831
What do you have anything to do with?

731
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,758
I don't know what's going on!

732
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,070
I'm playing a hunch, just like you.

733
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:31,988
I don't know.

734
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:35,029
But, son of a bitch, I keep believe in you.

735
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,392
Then listen to me.

736
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,793
There's a bridge coming.

737
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:45,397
Before we cross, the train slows down.

738
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,272
It's your chance to get off.

739
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,034
Why Maude?

740
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,073
Tell me.

741
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,598
- Something's going to happen tonight.
- What?

742
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:00,993
You're going to get killed.

743
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:29,549
Oh look who's here!
It's the Indian.

744
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:32,712
Oh sit with me, Indian.

745
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,792
What brings you this side
of the border, General?

746
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:41,629
You might call it a good will tour.

747
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,714
Where're you going, captain?

748
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,952
I'm joining your party.

749
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:01,071
You must be very strong.

750
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:05,312
- Like an ox.
- Hey find your own woman!

751
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,551
General, I thought this was
a good will tour.

752
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,236
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Abigail.

753
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,474
Abigail?

754
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,873
Abigail, sweetheart,...

755
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,270
... did you know something
terrible was gonna happen?

756
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:21,309
To me?

757
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,274
To all of us.

758
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:25,953
Don't listen to him!

759
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,476
Then ask general Sanchez.

760
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:40,591
General...

761
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:44,393
Captain, till you leave,
sit down.

762
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,879
Thank you.

763
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,675
- You'd like a cigar?
- No, thank you, Sir.

764
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,757
Are you going all the way
to Tucson, general?

765
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,268
No, I'm getting off at Santa Cruz.

766
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,549
I have a sister living there.

767
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:56,632
She's the baby of the family,
married now to a rancher.

768
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,712
She'd offered to let me stay
with them when I retire.

769
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:03,753
30 years in the service and I'm gonna
be taking in by my brother-in-law.

770
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,239
But I'm glad we ran into each other.

771
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,880
You know it's nice when you
know somebody on a train.

772
01:14:08,881 --> 01:14:10,836
Seems like I know everybody
on this train.

773
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,069
Oh, is that so?

774
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,839
General Sanchez.

775
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,072
- Know him?
- Abigail and Rosita, too.

776
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:21,830
Really?

777
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,799
You know who's in the next car, general?

778
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:26,595
Yes, sergeant O'Rourke.

779
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:30,710
I saw him board with a lady, I
think he was embarassed of seeing me.

780
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:34,193
- You happen to know the lady?
- I wish I did, she is attractive.

781
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:35,509
Isn't she?

782
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:39,917
There's a man on board named
Griffin, did you ever hear of him?

783
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,114
Where are you getting at?

784
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,355
There's something going on
on this train, general.

785
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,153
And I'm trying to put the pieces together.

786
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,876
You know, captain,
I think you are overworked.

787
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:53,792
You need to rest.

788
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,554
Oh a private car,
seems they're hooking on to us.

789
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:00,517
What's a private car doing way out here?

790
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:02,993
Easterners probably hunting party,...

791
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,276
... millionaires looking for thrills.

792
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,270
They gotta fight a few weeks in the cavalry.

793
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,716
Let's stretch our legs, are we?

794
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:22,470
Oh, fresh air, invigorating,...

795
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,676
... but chilly.
I'm going back inside.

796
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,311
President Grant passing through Arizona.

797
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,875
Ah, there you are.
Won't you join me?

798
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:13,793
There's nobody else to talk to.

799
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,557
- Guess I have to tell you.
- Tell me what?

800
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,873
Haven't you noticed?
Everybody's gone.

801
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,277
Well where are they,
in the next car?

802
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:27,557
The Mexican general
got away with a couple Indians.

803
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:29,835
Did?

804
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,037
Only they weren't Indians,
they were Mexicans dressed as Indians.

805
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,115
Mexicans?

806
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:38,119
O'Rourke is dead.

807
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:39,830
What's that you say?

808
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,755
- He tried to kill me.
- Why?

809
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,273
Maybe because of this.

810
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,395
- This is a forgery!
- It looks real enough.

811
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:53,473
That's not my signature!

812
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,433
Why should I order a massacre of Indians?

813
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:00,474
That private car we hooked on to.
It has a name.

814
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,593
The name is April Morning.

815
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,670
Collier knew about it,
that's why he was killed.

816
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,679
Now, general,...

817
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:10,639
... who is in that car?

818
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,748
President Grant is in that car.

819
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:17,392
I'm glad you said that, Sir.

820
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:19,837
I read in the newspaper
the President was on his way...

821
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,479
... to California.

822
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,549
They're gonna assassinate him.

823
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,913
They've been hired,
those Mexican bandits...

824
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,638
... to attack this train.

825
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:32,629
They dressed the Mexicans as Indians
so the Indians will be blamed for it.

826
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,560
Why would they want to
assassinate the President?

827 
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:39,108
I don't know,
but it's getting light out.

828
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:41,272
If we're gonna stop,
we better get going.

829
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,674
We're not!

830
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:46,590
You're not going anywhere, red ass!

831
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:49,709
Red ass?

832
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,156
You call me red ass too.

833
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:05,750
I shoot like a jealous wife,
first shot right through the heart.

834
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,598
- Where are they?
- In the baggage car.

835
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:18,512
- How many?
- Eight, are them.

836
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:21,593
- Come on!
- What are you doing? Where are we going?

837
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,152
What do you want me for?

838
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:30,798
- Open the door!
- They'll shoot me!

839
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,154
Open it!

840
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:38,559
Hi, it's only me.

841
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,831
No! No, please!

842
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,638
No! No!

843
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:48,469
Enough!

844
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:02,558
You shot me!

845
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,119
My ear!

846
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:09,593
You called that shot?

847
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,428
Not now!

848
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,072
Captain, there's someone here...

849
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:40,191
... wants to thank you personally,...

850
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,788
... the President
of the United States.

851
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:49,553
You're not the President.

852
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:53,632
I know general Grant,
I served under him!

853
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:02,269
You are one smart Indian.

854
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,476
The President
stayed behind in Tucson.

855
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:08,272
You knew all the time and
you let me go through all this.

856
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,115
What the hell for?

857
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:12,749
Because carpetbaggers were trying
to start an Indian war...

858
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:15,678
... and grab the whole southwest, that's why!

859
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,797
- Who are you?
- The new Indian commissioner.

860
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:24,510
I'm taking poor Collier's place.
And you're gonna help me, son.

861
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:27,868
On doing what?

862
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:31,480
The reservation land has become
too valuable.

863
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:34,315
It would only make trouble for your people.

864
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:37,398
We're gonna move them, to
Yellowsnake canyon.

865
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:40,033
Yellowsnake canyon?

866
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,119
It's full of snakes !

867
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,915
You're one dumb Indian.

868
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,030
Teach me the ways
of the white man.

869
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:04,913
First you steal a horse.
