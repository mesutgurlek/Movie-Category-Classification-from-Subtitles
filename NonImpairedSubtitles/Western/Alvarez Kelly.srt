1
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,120
In every war...

2
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:32,920
In every age...

3
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,880
The forgotten weapon is...

4
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,520
...Food. For to kill,
soldiers must live...

5
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,720
...to live, they must eat.

6
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,800
And a herd of cattle is...

7
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,640
...as vital as a herd of cannon.

8
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,400
The United States in 1 864.

9
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,680
Hey, we made it, amigos!

10
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,040
When you're ready to talk business,
Kelly, I'll be at my hotel.

11
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,360
- You're Steadman.
- Major Steadman.

12
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,360
Major Steadman.

13
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,760
Sorry.

14
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,360
Major, I've got the most
marvellous beef in the world for you.

15
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,920
The best beef in all of Mexico.
No, Sanchez?

16
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,960
They're a little thin by now,
but it's been a long walk.

17
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,120
- A few days in the pasture...
- You are late, Mr. Kelly.

18
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,120
Ten days late. Ten miserable days
in this stinking, hot town.

19
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,160
Is it Vermont or Massachusetts?

20
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,560
I'm from Boston...

21
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,720
...which, may I tell you, is one
long way from this prairie rat hole.

22
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,920
Well, there are certain compensations,
major, in a railroad town.

23
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,160
I was hoping that you brought
a couple of them along.

24
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,560
I see.

25
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,760
I don't happen to be a procurer,
Mr. Kelly.

26
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,120
Forgive me.

27
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,160
Whiskey or sherry?

28
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,120
I'm here on business, Mr. Kelly.
United States Army business.

29
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,520
I'm waiting for an explanation.

30
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,320
What were you in civilian life?

31
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,640
A lawyer. I want an explanation.

32
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,360
Lawyer, huh?

33
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,160
- You've never driven cattle?
- Hardly.

34
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,720
Hardly.

35
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,360
Three months, major. Not ten days.

36
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,000
Three months, staring into
the rear ends of those beeves.

37
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,520
Smelling their stink,
choking on their dust...

38
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,720
...listening to their
damn bellowing night and day.

39
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,720
I'm a reasonable man.

40
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,320
If I weren't...

41
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,320
...I might go over to the other side
and see how their manners are.

42
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,320
You'd do business
with the Confederates?

43
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,120
No.

44
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,960
Their money's no good.

45
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,320
Kelly.

46
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,280
What's he doing?

47
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,120
If I'm not mistaken,
someone's stealing my wine.

48
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,720
I thought you were a soldier,
not a sheriff.

49
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,120
You like my wine, Paco?

50
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,440
I like it if you do, huh?

51
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,720
Costs five dollars a bottle.

52
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,320
That's ten dollars out of your pay.

53
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,120
Since you're a generous man,
share the rest with your friends here.

54
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,920
I don't understand you.
I don't understand you at all.

55
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,320
A thief should be punished.

56
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,040
We'll have dinner now.

57
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,520
And take a few more bottles of wine
out to our friends.

58
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,760
He's a Ionely thief, Steadman...

59
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,760
...trying to celebrate
after a rough journey.

60
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,360
He'll be happy to go home.

61
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,120
They all will.

62
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,800
And so will I.

63
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,320
I'm afraid you won't be going home
quite yet, Mr. Kelly.

64
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,920
There's been a change.
Take the cattle by rail to Virginia.

65
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,120
Deliver them to a plantation
near Richmond. The pasture is there.

66
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,840
You'll be paid on arrival.

67
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,640
That's not in the agreement.

68
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,320
I was ordered to bring
the cattle here.

69
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,520
The war's going into a new phase.

70
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,320
We're concentrating on Richmond.
And when we take it, we've won.

71
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,520
I don't care who wins.

72
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,520
You want that herd in Virginia?

73
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,920
It'll cost you
five dollars per head extra.

74
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,040
I'm authorized to pay you one dollar
a head extra. Not a penny more.

75
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,920
That's not Army beef yet, major.

76
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,720
Not until I get paid off
on my contract.

77
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,840
The contract specifies, in rather
small print, I'll admit:

78
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,720
" Payment shall be made when the beef
is delivered to the area...

79
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,120
...deemed most urgent
by the commanding general."

80
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,800
Which is 30 miles south of Richmond.

81
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,720
It's in order. I prepared it myself.
Even specifying the size of the print.

82
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,640
Now those steers
are going east, Mr. Kelly.

83
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,760
Oh, by Godfrey, that judge.
He thought he had me licked.

84
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,720
Licked, Kelly.

85
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,320
But he underestimated the man
he was dealing with.

86
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,320
I hit that judge...

87
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,120
<i>I hit him with a writ of certiorari.</i>

88
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,920
It's like a brilliant bolt
out of the black, a tiger springing.

89
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,320
<i>A writ of certiorari!</i>

90
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,320
Play cards, Steadman.

91
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Thousands of them.

92
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,720
The boys in blue
are gonna eat beef tonight.

93
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,520
And tomorrow and next month.
Till it's coming out of their craws.

94
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,720
Maybe it's our stomachs
making us see what ain't there.

95
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,280
Colonel, how about me going
and bringing back proof.

96
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,720
Just to make it official.

97
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,920
My orders are to scout that herd.

98
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
Go ahead.

99
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,520
Just make sure
the Yanks don't scout me.

100
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Oh, Lord.

101
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,800
This is always embarrassing.

102
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,520
I'm sure you'll handle it
with your customary tact.

103
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,160
- Take over, captain.
- Yes, sir.

104
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,800
Major Steadman, ma'am.

105
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
I'm Charity Warwick.

106
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,120
This is Alvarez Kelly,
who brought the cattle here.

107
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,960
I was ordered to arrange quarters
for the two of you.

108
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,920
Your men can camp in the field
below the house.

109
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,520
Mr. Kelly, the grazing is best
in the north pasture.

110
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,160
You may eat
in my dining room tonight, major.

111
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,440
But from tomorrow on,
you'll make other arrangements.

112
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,960
Mrs. Warwick...

113
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,000
...will you join us for dinner?

114
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,360
Nice try, but I don't think...

115
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,120
She's a lady, Kelly.

116
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,560
A great lady.

117
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,120
One rarely has the privilege
to meet such a...

118
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,840
What does that mean?

119
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,320
Woman.

120
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,920
- Pick up those strays.
- I'll get them.

121
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,320
Go get that meat!

122
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,560
Sir?

123
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,240
Cleet Warwick must be
rolling around in his grave.

124
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,760
I'll bet this is the first time
his place...

125
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,240
...has been lit up like that
since Manassas.

126
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,160
- Eat while it's hot.
- The man who brought the cattle.

127
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,920
- Colonel, I promise you...
- That man really knew his business.

128
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,920
Moved that herd like it was
a column of infantry.

129
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,080
That's prime beef, Johnny.

130
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,520
And there's enough down there
to feed a lot of people...

131
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,520
...who haven't chewed on meat
in a long, long time.

132
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,760
Thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty.

133
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,760
Now with the $1 0,000 advance
paid to you in Mexico...

134
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,120
...it makes it a total of $50,000
and completes our original contract.

135
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,920
Plus the...

136
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,920
...additional $2500.

137
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,920
Just sign here.

138
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,120
- Buying beef at three dollars a head.
- Two.

139
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,440
- And selling them for 20.
- Not bad.

140
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,720
It's outrageous.

141
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,720
You go to some nice place
to count your profits?

142
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,720
I spend it, Steadman.
I spend it and enjoy it.

143
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,920
And when it's all gone,
raise it again.

144
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,520
You make it sound simple.

145
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,120
It is, if you don't want it too bad.

146
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,920
Money, whiskey and women.
Your three deities.

147
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,320
Tell me something, Mr. Kelly:

148
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,920
Have they made you a happy man?

149
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,720
No.

150
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,520
But not as miserable a one as you.

151
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,160
Mrs. Warwick.

152
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,280
Dinner is served, gentlemen.

153
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,840
How nice. You changed your mind.

154
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,320
A lady's privilege.

155
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,720
Your privilege is our pleasure, ma'am.

156
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,520
I got hungry.

157
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,160
Driving thousands of half-wild
animals across thousands of miles.

158
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,720
For someone brought up in these parts,
it seems impossible.

159
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,520
I have such respect
for special knowledge.

160
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,160
It's nothing.

161
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,560
You certainly know how
to charge for it.

162
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,560
Do you object to making money,
Miss Charity?

163
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,360
In wartime? I think so.

164
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,320
Making money out of war.
It's almost an act of nature.

165
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,880
Do you have any idea
what a major's salary is?

166
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,920
I wasn't talking about that.

167
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,360
What about a colone"s salary?
And the prestige afterward?

168
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,840
You'll carry that rank
into every courtroom for life.

169
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,320
- I didn't go to war for that.
- No, but you'll use it.

170
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,960
Every man, in his own special way,
takes care of number one.

171
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,920
I don't admire men like that,
Mr. Kelly.

172
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,120
Mrs. Warwick...

173
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,640
...if there were a kind of profit
driven right into your own back yard...

174
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,920
...would there be any reason not
to take advantage of it?

175
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,120
What do you mean by that?

176
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,920
I would say it's a matter
of the north pasture.

177
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,080
The north...
You're talking in riddles.

178
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,120
To you, ma'am?

179
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,920
I don't understand.

180
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,720
I was curious.

181
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,160
When Mrs. Warwick specified the
north pasture, I wanted to know why.

182
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,120
The soil, major, is overworked.

183
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,280
Dying for the lack of fertilizer.

184
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,520
- Well, yes, but I still don't...
- Manure, major.

185
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,120
I didn't know you were a farmer.

186
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,040
I was raised on a farm.

187
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,160
<i>My father's estancia in Texas.</i>

188
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,040
<i>Estancia. What a lovely word.</i>

189
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,720
<i>So is caridad.</i>

190
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,720
Charity.

191
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,560
Yes, it was lovely.

192
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,120
It was lovely and big.

193
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,720
Open.

194
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,120
Fifty families lived on it.

195
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,840
My father was like a lord.
Like an Irish lord.

196
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,960
Yet this virtuous Irish lord...

197
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,520
...was not quite able to stop his son
from turning pirate, was he?

198
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,920
Make jokes, Steadman, about the war,
about God, and about me.

199
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,560
But don't make jokes about my father.

200
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,040
He was killed defending our home.

201
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,560
Mexican War, I think you called it.

202
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,280
We had other names for the theft
of a piece of our country.

203
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,120
The officers wore the same uniform
you have on.

204
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,720
Only some of them now
have changed it to grey.

205
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,920
So I say, "Alvarez Kelly...

206
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,280
...take what you can from both sides.
Small return for your birthright."

207
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,600
- Beg pardon, ma'am.
- What is it?

208
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,560
A guard found one of our drovers...

209
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,160
...beaten and unconscious.
- We're 30 miles behind the lines!

210
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,400
They butchered a steer
inside the gates.

211
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,120
Where the hell were the sentries?
Excuse me.

212
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,520
All right, let's go.

213
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,320
The poor major.

214
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,320
He finds duty more fascinating than...

215
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,120
...pleasure.

216
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,320
Do you undress every woman you meet?

217
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,920
There has to be some beauty.

218
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,120
Then it's no special compliment.

219
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,040
Being a beautiful woman
is compliment enough.

220
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,120
<i>From what you've said
about your father's estancia...</i>

221
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,320
...it must have been something
like it was here before the war.

222
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,320
Very much like it.

223
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,320
Might be interesting
to buy some land around here.

224
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,160
Not to help rebuild, though.
Not to live.

225
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,680
- Just to buy cheap and sell dear.
- It's a nuisance the other way around.

226
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,960
You disappoint me, Mr. Kelly.

227
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,840
After what happened to you, I should
think you'd sympathize with us.

228
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,320
I have no sympathies, only instincts.
And they shy away from losers.

229
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,520
I'm overstaying my welcome.
You must be tired.

230
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,320
You underestimate yourself, Mr. Kelly.

231
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,320
Rarely.

232
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,720
Thank you for the evening.

233
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,560
How long since you've been
with a woman?

234
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,520
Three months.

235
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,360
A lifetime.

236
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,920
My husband's been dead three years.

237
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,520
There was someone
under the bed all the time.

238
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,360
Hatcher.

239
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,560
The money.

240
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,400
I got just as many men outside.

241
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,520
I warn you, I'm a Mexican national.

242
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,600
Doing business with the Yanks.

243
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,520
- My privilege.
- Grazer!

244
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,520
The money.

245
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,040
Obliged, Mr. Kelly.

246
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,920
Just how far would you have gone?

247
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,120
You bastards couldn't have
waited a while longer.

248
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,520
Hatcher.

249
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,680
Good night, Charity.

250
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,640
God bless.

251
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,640
Take care, Tom. God bless.

252
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,920
God bless, Charity.

253
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,920
Bless.

254
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,080
Oh, Mrs. Warwick.

255
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,600
Good night and God bless.

256
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
Yes?

257
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,520
Major Steadman.

258
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,520
- Yes, major?
- You had visitors.

259
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,320
Old friends of mine.

260
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,880
Old, dear friends.

261
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,560
And why did they take Kelly?

262
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,720
For the money, wouldn't you say?

263
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,560
They didn't have to kidnap him
to get his money.

264
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,760
Perhaps they didn't want to shoot him
in front of me.

265
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,360
Shoot him? For what?

266
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,920
The way they see it, he committed
an act of war against the Confederacy.

267
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,120
Of course, they're prejudiced.

268
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,920
Mrs. Warwick...

269
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,440
...did you know about this?

270
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,320
Of course! I saw it happen.

271
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,680
No, I mean beforehand.
I mean aiding and abetting.

272
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,360
Oh, that difficult lawyer talk, major.

273
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,760
Mr. Kelly was certainly right.

274
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,920
Alvarez Kelly hijacked by rebels.

275
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,480
You appreciate that, major?

276
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,320
Mrs. Warwick.

277
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,320
- Beaurider.
- Yes, sir.

278
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,760
Get back to camp fast as you can.

279
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,040
Straight back. We've had
our enjoyment for the evening.

280
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,120
Yes, sir.

281
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,120
Turn them around, boys!

282
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,920
Now that that's over, would you mind
telling me what this is all about?

283
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,520
Not yet. Get in.

284
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,840
- Tell him to keep his hands off me.
- Get in.

285
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,160
I may choose not to.

286
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,720
You may choose to die too.

287
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,360
You'd give up those stripes for that
privilege, wouldn't you, sergeant?

288
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,120
As long as you knew
my hands were tied.

289
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,760
Rossiter, we both know you didn't
bring me this far to shoot me.

290
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,360
For some reason, you want me alive
and in one piece. Why?

291
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,920
You know, Mr. Kelly,
you talk too much. Get in.

292
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,240
I'd like to tell you
a little something.

293
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,440
This river winds
all the way to Richmond.

294
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,080
Now, if I was to put you to sleep...

295
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,520
...you'd miss some of the prettiest
scenery in all of Virginia.

296
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,960
Colonel, in my inside pocket,
where my money used to be...

297
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,720
...there's a cigar.
You could get it for me.

298
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,720
Or better yet...

299
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,720
...I could get it for myself.

300
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,040
Bust him, colonel, sir!
Make him shut his big mouth.

301
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,120
Confederate man-of-war?

302
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,560
Kelly, we've got to have that beef.

303
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,040
The army and the whole South
is starving.

304
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,120
- That's your problem, not mine.
- Damn it!

305
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,720
If hungry people don't mean
anything to you, this should!

306
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,920
That already belongs to me.

307
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,080
We'll double it.

308
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,720
In gold, colonel?

309
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,120
Are you suggesting
our currency is no good, sir?

310
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,960
Can I tell you what for?

311
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,400
Colonel, I have to hand it to you.
You're not just half-mad.

312
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,840
How do you figure you're going to
get 2500 head of cattle...

313
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,160
...over Grant's lines? By balloon?

314
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,960
Nope. We don't have
that many balloons.

315
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,360
All right, we can't get over them.

316
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,720
But we can go around.

317
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,720
We can make this big circle.
Come up behind the plantation.

318
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,160
Then we just shoo those cattle
back the way we came.

319
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,120
- Just "shoo" them back?
- That's right.

320
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,880
You know there's a small army
guarding those steers.

321
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,920
Don't you expect a fight?

322
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,520
I'll handle the military.
You handle the herd.

323
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,560
- Fair division.
- Then you'll do it?

324
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,800
Mr. Harrison, I intend to die in bed,
in the arms of a beautiful woman.

325
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,640
We all share that wish, sir.

326
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,240
I do not intend to die
from a Yankee bullet.

327
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,520
So I say the hell with it, colonel.

328
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,720
You're not walking out of here.

329
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,720
This city is swarming with spies,
and you know our plan.

330
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,240
Worth nothing.

331
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,680
You couldn't even try it without me.

332
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,120
Oh, look at the soldier boy!

333
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,720
Morning.

334
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,720
Morning.

335
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,720
Enjoying yourself?

336
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,720
Oh, yes.

337
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,960
I like cockroaches with my soup.

338
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,160
Specialty of the house.

339
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,040
You about ready to leave?

340
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,160
Not under your terms.

341
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,760
- But I've got some advice for you.
- Yeah? What's that?

342
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,040
Nobody's even gonna start to move
that herd out without drovers.

343
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,880
- My Comanches can handle it.
- Cavalry?

344
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,360
Top riders. Fought under Jeb Stuart.

345
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,560
Any Texans among them? Cowhands?

346
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,560
They're Virginians.

347
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,720
And there's no damn thing anybody
can do on a horse they can't match.

348
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,520
No, except maybe drive a cow
out of a closet.

349
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,680
Takes a long time to train a drover.

350
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,920
Jailer!

351
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,720
Open up.

352
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,160
Mr. Kelly, your education
has been sadly neglected.

353
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,840
Not bad.

354
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,320
But you're not charging the enemy.

355
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,920
You're pushing cattle.
For that, you need trained cowboys.

356
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,240
- Now look...
- These is warhorses, mister.

357
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,920
I reckon they can handle
them little old cows.

358
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,720
All right, lieutenant.

359
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,720
Take your warhorses and push those
little old cows into that back corral.

360
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,720
With your permission, colonel?

361
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,840
Move, cow.

362
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,520
Come on, cows! Get in there!

363
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,920
You darn fool cows, get in there!

364
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,480
Come on, get in there!

365
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,920
You darn fool cows, get in there!

366
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,640
Colonel, where the hell you get these
cows? From an old ladies' home?

367
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,320
Move them out!

368
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,640
Get on! Get out of here!
Get out of here!

369
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,120
All right, you darn fool cow!

370
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,120
Come on!

371
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,920
Get out of my way!
Go on! Move along there!

372
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,360
Watch out!

373
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,520
- Sound retreat.
- What's that, sir?

374
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,920
- I said sound retreat!
- Yes, sir.

375
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,520
Close the gate.

376
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,320
Get those cattle! Go on, get them.

377
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,240
Now, listen:

378
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,160
There are 2500 head of Mexican
range-bred steers on that plantation...

379
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,720
...stupid, temperamental and a lot more
vicious than anything you've got here.

380
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,320
All right, so we got plenty to learn.

381
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,080
But you can train us.

382
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,520
Damn you, Kelly,
you're gonna train us!

383
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,600
Back to jail.

384
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,720
Are you coming in or am I going out?

385
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,440
General Lee has approved the raid.

386
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,520
That makes you the only missing link.

387
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,000
Missing's the word.

388
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,320
That's a lot of cash to carry around,
colonel. It'd be safer in a bank.

389
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,120
Matter of fact, I'll give you
permission to open an account in...

390
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,920
They'll be butchering and eating
that herd before long.

391
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,560
I figure you've got no more
than ten days to get us ready.

392
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,720
Burn it all.

393
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,200
Ten days before we start.

394
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,320
God deliver me from dedicated men.

395
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,160
Ten days.

396
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,160
You used to have ten fingers.
Now you got nine.

397
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,160
Tomorrow, you'll have eight.

398
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,440
You stay stubborn, the day after that,
you'll have seven.

399
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,960
The day after that...

400
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,280
...it's up to you.

401
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,440
You decide whether you want to end up
with a pair of stumps...

402
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,280
...or lend us your talent.

403
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,920
You decide.

404
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,880
Get a doctor.

405
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,200
Don't split them up like that.
Get them.

406
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,120
All right, get those back.
Get them together.

407
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,120
He drives hard, I'm glad to say.

408
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,560
Don't split them up! Slow down there!
Take it easy with them.

409
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,960
I deplore what happened, colonel.

410
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,840
- However, under the circumstances...
- It was necessary.

411
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,920
Still, there's a time for sandpaper
and a time for silk.

412
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,840
From now on, I think we'd be wise
to cater to his taste.

413
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,920
I want to borrow a hat.

414
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,640
- Tool of the trade.
- Will mine do?

415
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:31,320
Mr. Kelly, I'd be honoured if you'd
accept the hospitality of my home...

416
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,280
...for the remainder of your visit.

417
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,640
I believe you'd find
the accommodations more cheerful...

418
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,280
...than your present quarters.

419
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,480
- And the bourbon?
- More plentiful.

420
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,480
You gentlemen have a way
of making it hard for me to refuse.

421
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,520
Who am I?

422
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,080
You're a rich land speculator
looking for bargains.

423
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,280
Seems to me I heard you mention
something like that...

424
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,080
...recently.

425
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,920
Satisfactory?

426
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,800
Yes, yes, that would go down well
with anyone who was curious.

427
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,760
Mrs. Townsend is having a soiree
next week. Nothing pretentious.

428
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,080
No, certainly not.
Not in starving Richmond.

429
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,040
I can't offer you a clean shirt...

430
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,320
...but we'll take care
of the one you got.

431
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,880
That's thoughtful.

432
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,120
Now watch this.

433
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,400
Slow down.

434
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,080
When he moves to your house...

435
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,480
...one of my men goes with him.

436
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,480
Naturally.

437
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,520
Oh, Mr. Kelly, I couldn't.
I'd love to, but I just couldn't.

438
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,680
- I'm spoken for.
- Loudly?

439
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,920
By a seafaring monster
who can shrivel a girl right up.

440
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,480
Where's he?

441
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,880
Very impressive.

442
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,200
Since you and I are only
going to be friends...

443
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,120
...it's only fair that
you turn me over to her.

444
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,520
Liz Pickering?
You're really running in luck tonight.

445
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,320
- Married?
- Engaged.

446
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,480
It's not the same, is it?

447
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,320
I bet you could tell me,
if you really wanted to.

448
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,880
Military secret.

449
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,480
- Damn the military and their secrets.
- Come on.

450
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,200
I suppose it's very dangerous.

451
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,680
Not as dangerous as you.

452
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,680
The way you look tonight, you could
start pandemonium in the streets.

453
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,880
And that perfume...

454
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,680
But you do prefer horse sweat.

455
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,880
Oh, Tommy, I'm sorry,
but I see you so seldom.

456
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,880
You know, that's what
I hate most about the Yanks.

457
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,280
They keep us apart.

458
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,480
I understand married officers
have more leave than single ones.

459
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,400
But what if one
of those nasty old Yanks...

460
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,680
...threw a speck of dust
in my other eye?

461
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,000
How would you look leading
a blind man down the street?

462
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,480
As foolish as you sound
talking about it.

463
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,680
Thank you.

464
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,080
Who's he?

465
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,920
Rich businessman from Mexico.
Friend of the Harrisons.

466
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,480
But not a friend of yours?

467
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,280
No.

468
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,680
Tom, what's the matter?

469
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,880
I don't know.

470
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,880
I guess the war's the matter.

471
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,440
War's the matter with all of us.

472
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,920
Mr. Kelly, this is
Captain Angus Ferguson of Glasgow.

473
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,880
- Captain.
- Isn't he magnificent?

474
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,680
Aye, it's good when they adore you,
especially when they're half your age.

475
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,320
Or could it be the wee gifts
I bring her in my ship?

476
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,560
The French perfumes
and silk nighties?

477
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,000
- Let's dance.
- I'm not used to a ballroom.

478
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,880
There are many stout lads
to stretch your muscles.

479
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,680
If you don't put your arm around me
now, I'll take you up on that.

480
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,080
I will dance the whole night through
with you in my rooms.

481
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,160
Angus, you're a devil.

482
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,200
No use telling her
it's my farewell night, is there?

483
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,240
Not till morning, that is.

484
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,080
Which one of you will help me
make an old sea dog jealous?

485
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,480
Tom.

486
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,680
Rank does have its responsibilities.
Go ahead, darling.

487
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,520
So I weigh anchor tomorrow evening,
courtesy of Secretary Harrison.

488
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,120
After four months wait
and a good deal more effort...

489
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,080
...than a Scotsman cares to spend.

490
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,280
For mercy sakes, no, Mr. Kelly.

491
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,520
That stuff there will
distemper a whale.

492
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:17,480
Here, you take a taste of this.
Blessed nectar from Scotland.

493
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,040
Will you believe it, there are
1 000 bottles of that aboard my ship?

494
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,080
Sounds like paradise.

495
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,520
I was commissioned to run it
in here, but then I found...

496
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,720
Confederate money isn't worth
the match to burn it with.

497
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,840
Aye, so I'll take it to New York.

498
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,480
Heavens, Mr. Kelly, don't tell me
the currency there is still wampum.

499
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,240
Mr. Kelly, you have my flask!

500
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,120
If I may suggest, Miss Pickering,
the punch is pale.

501
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,840
This will improve the colour.

502
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,480
You're gallant enough
to be a Virginian.

503
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,480
And your beauty goes beyond
the bounds of geography.

504
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,240
I'm Alvarez Kelly.

505
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,120
And you've learned my name
and a few particulars.

506
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,480
Only one.

507
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,720
You've shortchanged yourself.

508
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,880
You could remedy that.

509
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,200
Are you any kind of gambler, Kelly?

510
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,680
I've lost my last few bets.

511
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,960
Will you come to my house?

512
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,280
I need some advice that
can't very well be given here.

513
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,040
What time?

514
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,080
Midnight, number 1 9, Royall Street.

515
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,680
Make sure there's no carriage outside.

516
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,080
Why, Mr. Kelly, whatever
happened to your hand?

517
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,680
One of the bets I lost.

518
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,520
Darling, I think he's rather charming.

519
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,920
Yeah.

520
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,480
- You understand?
- Playing with fire, aren't you, lad?

521
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,080
It's not my house.

522
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,880
Now, follow me.

523
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,680
With all of the beautiful women
that were here tonight...

524
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,200
...the result is
I don't feel much like sleeping.

525
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,880
You know what I mean?

526
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:33,080
I don't know how to put it to your
delicate ears, but in Richmond there...

527
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,880
There must be a house of joy.

528
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,000
There's a few.

529
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,880
Now, let me guess
what your orders were.

530
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,320
Let him do what he wants...

531
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,480
...but don't let him
out of your sight. Right?

532
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,960
Well, let's be off.
Two men of the world.

533
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,880
You ever seen him before?

534
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,720
No, but I wish I had.

535
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,480
Kelly, you might not like these women.

536
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,720
I understand that the Mexicans
like their women fat and dumpy.

537
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,400
Relax, Hatcher, you can't
make me angry tonight.

538
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,800
What part of Mexico, amigo?

539
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,760
Durango, amigo.

540
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,520
You Ionely?

541
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,480
Not really.

542
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,280
Friendly?

543
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,880
Not very.

544
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,680
Thirsty?

545
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,920
Not especially.

546
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,080
You're the one I want.

547
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,680
A bottle of your best wine.

548
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,880
- This is where I draw the line.
- I'll wait.

549
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,680
May take all night.

550
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,080
Should I take it off?

551
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,120
The wedding ring.

552
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,080
Some like it on, some like it off.
You men are peculiar.

553
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,280
What do you do in case of fire?

554
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,760
I don't know, we never had one.

555
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,680
Well, suppose you had one right now.

556
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,600
There's a window with
a big, old wisteria vine right by it.

557
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,080
Show me.

558
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,680
Now, look, I want you
to stay here all night...

559
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,920
...and improve your mind.

560
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,280
Your body's already perfect.

561
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,880
Come in, sir.

562
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,680
Miss Pickering will be down
in a minute, sir.

563
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,080
My Japanese room. Uncluttered.

564
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,480
Does she have to stay here?

565
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,280
You can go to bed now, Ellie.

566
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,480
Why, Kelly, whatever
are you thinking of?

567
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,080
I was thinking there might be...

568
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,880
...some chimney sweeps
up there in grey uniforms.

569
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,520
I've grown to expect anything
from Southern belles.

570
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,080
I'm not a Southern belle.
I'm Liz Pickering.

571
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,920
This house was something
quite special in its day.

572
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,920
Sorry you couldn't have seen it.

573
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,680
Used to be a lovely miniature
over the mantle.

574
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,480
Till last week. It paid for
the gown I wore this evening.

575
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,680
I don't know why you asked me here,
but it was not to pity you.

576
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,240
Hardly. Pity is the real
empty room I despise.

577
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,880
I amuse you, Kelly?

578
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,680
It's too early to tell.

579
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,800
Well, we're getting older
by the minute.

580
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,960
Would you like to drink that
where it's more comfortable?

581
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:24,480
Whatever your friend's got,
he ought to market it, huh?

582
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,920
Well, good night.

583
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:29,280
Wherever did you get wine
at this time of night?

584
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,880
Ask me no questions.

585
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,920
Haven't tasted anything so good
since the war began.

586
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,880
You should've seen that too, Kelly.
It was grand.

587
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,880
That was the year Tom Rossiter
and I became engaged.

588
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,280
The year the boys went off singing.

589
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,280
I begged Tommy to marry me.

590
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,920
It wasn't very ladylike,
but I begged him.

591
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,080
I loved him so much.

592
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,840
But he was noble, he had principal.

593
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,280
Said he couldn't risk
leaving me a widow.

594
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,880
The second and the third years...

595
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,480
...the singing somehow stopped.

596
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,720
I still wanted Tommy to marry me.

597
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,880
He'd lost an eye by then,
but that didn't matter.

598
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,920
But he was nobler than ever.

599
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,880
Said it might be an arm next
or a leg.

600
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,880
Those were the years of frustration.

601
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,880
Then tonight...

602
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,920
Tonight I realized
what he feared the most.

603
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,440
Losing his sight.

604
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,680
Tom Rossiter is right.

605
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,080
I couldn't stand
to live with half a man.

606
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,480
God, Kelly. It must be
some hideous failing in me.

607
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,480
I'm so sick and tired to death
of all the fighting and killing...

608
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,280
...and trying to be brave
and patient over a lost cause.

609
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,720
So then we come to the fourth year.

610
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,080
The year of temptation.

611
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,480
Thank God you're not another one
of those honourable men.

612
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,080
I've spent my life
surrounded by honourable men.

613
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,680
Enjoying myself is one
of my weaknesses.

614
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,880
I guess people like us
have our own kind of honour.

615
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,480
It's not your advice I want, Kelly.
It's your money.

616
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,920
- House mortgaged?
- I've been asked to vacate.

617
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,880
Any other assets?

618
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,720
Myself.

619
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,680
To buy another dress?

620
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,280
I want you to help me
get out of Richmond.

621
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,680
At the moment, impossible.

622
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,360
Nothing's impossible for you...

623
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,840
The minute our good colonel
found out I was missing...

624
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,920
...he'd send a regiment after me.
I wouldn't make it to the city limits.

625
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,680
Tom and you?

626
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,520
- You're not what you're supposed to be.
- Who is?

627
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,600
Then why did you come here tonight?

628
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,880
Many reasons.

629
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,280
Mainly because you were his girl.

630
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,280
Only now, I find out you're not.

631
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:46,720
If I could manage something for you,
would you be willing to go anywhere?

632
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,960
Anywhere.

633
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,880
There's a chance.

634
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,880
Just a chance.

635
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,160
Then you will try?

636
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,400
Yes, I'll try.

637
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,240
Kelly, I think we ought
to drink to that.

638
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,080
I think we should.
I promised a friend that...

639
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,680
...this might take all night.

640
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:12,280
I wouldn't make a liar out of you
for anything in the world.

641
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,280
Now, the main thing
to remember is that...

642
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,320
...cattle are like women.

643
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,200
Sometimes you have to be firm.

644
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,720
Sometimes you have to be gentle.

645
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,880
And sometimes you have to give them
a slap on the rump.

646
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,680
Your pistol, captain.

647
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:49,080
Now that's just a reminder that
the sound of gunfire spooks cattle.

648
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,320
A sound that's practically
guaranteed on our venture.

649
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,080
All right, now start singing, captain.

650
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,920
That's right. Sing.

651
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,040
Music's the best medicine
for scared animals.

652
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,320
Now, look here.

653
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,440
The man said sing!

654
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,680
Yes, sir!

655
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,320
Loud and clear!

656
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,720
<i>I wish I was in the land of cotton</i>

657
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,080
You, Hatcher, out there and sing.

658
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,480
For the want of one voice,
the battle could be lost.

659
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,480
Sing.

660
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,880
- Damn it, sing!
- Colonel.

661
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:50,680
You know, I keep wondering
why you came back to us...

662
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,480
...after slipping away from Hatcher.

663
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,680
I have a commitment.

664
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,080
Don't suppose you'd care
to say where you went.

665
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,680
Not yet.

666
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,000
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

667
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,720
Developing a new weapon, Tom?
Trying to scare the Yanks to death?

668
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,200
His idea.

669
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,360
I hope those wailing banshees
are ready.

670
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,080
They're ready.
We move tonight, on schedule.

671
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,080
I know your opinion, I want his.

672
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,720
What about it?
Can the men manage the herd?

673
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,040
If he would keep after them
so that the men sing on key...

674
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,520
You're beginning
to annoy me, Mr. Kelly.

675
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,600
To the point of refusing my services?

676
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,480
Mr. Kelly, I'd give you
the Richmond symphony...

677
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,760
...if they weren't already
in the army.

678
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,040
Polish up your contralto, Tom...

679
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,880
...and I'll notify General Lee
you're set to go.

680
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,800
Carry on. I'm going back to town.

681
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,880
Nothing like a bath, a bite to eat
and a bottle of whiskey before battle.

682
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,720
- Reception.
- Yes, sir?

683
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,680
My name is Kelly.
Captain Ferguson is expecting me.

684
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,680
Tell him I'm in the dining room.

685
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,880
I shall tend to that, Mr. Kelly.

686
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,560
I'd like a double whiskey.

687
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,560
- Make that two. One for the captain.
- Mr. Kelly.

688
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,600
- Hope I didn't disturb you.
- Not at all.

689
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,560
I was just packing my gear.

690
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,080
- Getting ready to shove off.
- Aye, that I am. At nightfall.

691
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,560
Now, what can I do for you?

692
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,960
Book a passenger. A lady.

693
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,360
Anyone I might know?

694
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,160
Beside the point.

695
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,160
And yourself.

696
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,160
No.

697
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,600
<i>Now, the Athena is a broad ship,
but she's tiny.</i>

698
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,360
I don't think...

699
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,560
Two thousand.

700
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,000
On the other hand, I am a man
with no contempt for money at all.
