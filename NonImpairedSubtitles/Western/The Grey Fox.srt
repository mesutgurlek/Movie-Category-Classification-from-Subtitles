1
00:02:39,746 --> 00:02:45,224
Bill, with electrification, there'll be
a revolution in the American kitchen.

2
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:48,863
Our company has got designs for
an electric toast-making machine.

3
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:54,873
I hear stories of a stove that heats up
all by itself, at the flip of a switch.

4
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:00,835
What do you think of that? Yes sir, the
future of house ware sales is unlimited.

5
00:03:01,152 --> 00:03:05,508
I feel danged lucky to be part of it.
─ That sounds mighty fine Mr Simms.

6
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,034
Now .. you're darn tooting it's fine.

7
00:03:08,804 --> 00:03:15,437
Of course, to a man my age, the future
don't mean much, except past next week.

8
00:03:16,022 --> 00:03:19,202
Just hang on a minute there Bill.
I want to show you something.

9
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:22,845
I'm sure I got one here.

10
00:03:28,404 --> 00:03:30,226
Now, what do you think of that?

11
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,893
This would hook on to the side of the
board or on top of a table or something.

12
00:03:35,522 --> 00:03:39,522
Now see that action. Watch
this .. put her on there.

13
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:45,653
That's really something.

14
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,851
Isn't that something?
What do you think of that?

15
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:53,783
A fine piece of workmanship.
─ I'll tell you Bill ..

16
00:03:54,162 --> 00:03:58,314
This is the kind of product that in
the future will make your head spin.

17
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,465
Why don't you try one?
─ I'd hate to break it.

18
00:04:02,386 --> 00:04:04,702
You won't break this.
These will last a lifetime.

19
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,490
That's it.

20
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:17,343
Are you a .. a seafaring man, Bill?
─ Pardon?

21
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:20,646
Well I just noticed that tattoo there.
─ I've never been to sea.

22
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:24,720
What kind of work do you do, Bill?
─ Well, I'm between jobs right now.

23
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:28,748
No kidding. Well, what
kind of work did you do?

24
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:34,851
I robbed stagecoaches.

25
00:06:31,364 --> 00:06:32,650
Hello Jenny.

26
00:06:42,303 --> 00:06:45,946
I've brought you this little
gizmo from San Francisco.

27
00:07:00,947 --> 00:07:02,712
I guess I have aged some.

28
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:09,022
This little machine .. peels
apples real good.

29
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,834
Come on .. let's go and meet Tom.

30
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,045
What can you do?
─ I'll find work.

31
00:07:28,092 --> 00:07:30,289
I hear they're hiring
over at the oyster-beds.

32
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:37,544
It will be easier .. than
where I've been.

33
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:42,345
I know about where you've been.

34
00:07:43,556 --> 00:07:45,538
And what you done to get there.

35
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:49,054
I frankly .. don't have
much use for your kind.

36
00:07:51,251 --> 00:07:55,058
Well I .. hope I have a chance
to soften your opinion on that.

37
00:08:04,398 --> 00:08:07,299
What I think about you
is neither here nor there.

38
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:12,170
You are Jenny's brother .. you
can stay if that's what she wants.

39
00:11:43,305 --> 00:11:45,277
This isn't what I had in mind, sir.

40
00:11:47,962 --> 00:11:52,714
I'd prefer something .. with
a little more heft to it.

41
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:57,484
May I look at that?
─ The Colt?

42
00:12:50,858 --> 00:12:53,642
Hey .. Miner. You're Bill Miner, right?

43
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:58,189
Have we met, sir?
─ I'm Dan Young. I was in San Quentin ..

44
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:03,764
Four years back. Remember when you got
knifed by Bill Hitch? You remember that?

45
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:09,002
I don't remember you.
─ I thought that you died.

46
00:13:09,603 --> 00:13:11,002
Well I haven't.

47
00:13:16,843 --> 00:13:18,035
You're in luck, Bill.

48
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:21,434
I've put together a gang.

49
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,434
Like Jesse James?

50
00:13:30,597 --> 00:13:32,983
I figured we'd do some holdups.
That's your line, right?

51
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:36,916
No .. I just rob stagecoaches.

52
00:13:38,062 --> 00:13:39,902
Have you tried to find one nowadays?

53
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:43,583
Besides, stagecoaches, banks,
stores. They're all the same.

54
00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:45,790
No, it's not the same.

55
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:49,396
A professional always specializes.

56
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,137
Well yours has gone.
Just like the buffalo.

57
00:13:53,865 --> 00:13:55,630
Maybe I could teach you something new.

58
00:13:56,632 --> 00:13:58,597
How do you rob these banks?

59
00:13:58,898 --> 00:14:01,974
Simple. All I need is four or
five guys with guns and guts.

60
00:14:05,462 --> 00:14:09,566
Well that sounds simple enough.
─ So you want to throw in with me? Right?

61
00:14:10,364 --> 00:14:12,496
No thanks.
─ Why not?

62
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:15,493
I don't work for anybody.

63
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:18,018
You're getting a little old
to be choosy, ain't you?

64
00:14:21,548 --> 00:14:23,605
Well, that's exactly why I have to be.

65
00:14:25,869 --> 00:14:29,447
I've got to go.
─ Hey no. Come on, come on. Look ..

66
00:14:30,743 --> 00:14:32,484
Why don't you lend me
a couple of dollars, huh?

67
00:14:32,822 --> 00:14:35,705
I know you got at least twenty, thirty
dollars in your release envelope.

68
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:42,878
A professional never begs.

69
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:46,164
I ain't begging you Grandpa!
You give me the money.

70
00:14:50,877 --> 00:14:54,666
Well, maybe I do have something for you.

71
00:15:07,646 --> 00:15:09,129
You're not worth killing, but if ..

72
00:15:09,678 --> 00:15:12,772
You come at me again, I'll put a
window through your head, so help me.

73
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,972
I apologize for this
disturbance, gentlemen.

74
00:15:33,043 --> 00:15:34,546
I'm no oyster-picker.

75
00:15:37,056 --> 00:15:38,363
But I thought things ..

76
00:15:39,475 --> 00:15:40,774
Were going so well.

77
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:44,808
You have work .. and a place with us.

78
00:15:52,427 --> 00:15:53,684
What will you do?

79
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,015
Move out .. head down Portland way.

80
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:02,670
Maybe do some prospecting.

81
00:16:05,557 --> 00:16:07,130
The gold-rush is over Bill.

82
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:12,576
Sounds like I missed out on
all the good opportunities.

83
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:17,920
Please stay.

84
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:34,736
Since my release from prison .. I've
realized something about myself.

85
00:16:35,931 --> 00:16:37,156
I've got to act on it.

86
00:16:38,853 --> 00:16:41,931
I'm just no good at work that's
planned by other heads.

87
00:16:43,175 --> 00:16:45,884
I've got ambitions in me,
that just won't quit.

88
00:18:32,376 --> 00:18:34,088
Keep the engine crew ahead of you.

89
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:40,917
Check him out.

90
00:18:51,098 --> 00:18:52,473
Let's get out of here!

91
00:19:12,838 --> 00:19:14,622
Give us his name, son.

92
00:19:29,955 --> 00:19:31,041
Miner.

93
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:33,588
Get this lad some water.

94
00:20:29,735 --> 00:20:31,306
Morning.
─ Hello.

95
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:35,046
Is .. this the road to Olympia?

96
00:20:36,247 --> 00:20:38,129
Ten more miles will get you there.

97
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:41,406
Chew of tobacco?
─ Thank you, sir.

98
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:43,858
Looks like you been walking some.

99
00:20:44,975 --> 00:20:47,134
Not the best idea for a man your age.

100
00:20:47,886 --> 00:20:50,684
I haven't got any choice,
I've got a brother dying there.

101
00:20:52,722 --> 00:20:54,651
I couldn't walk a mile
with this leg of mine.

102
00:20:57,097 --> 00:20:58,787
Morning, Mr Laughton.

103
00:21:00,787 --> 00:21:02,442
I guess you're wanting your mail?

104
00:24:07,262 --> 00:24:09,909
Hey George! Say, what you get?

105
00:24:10,275 --> 00:24:16,395
Sons of bitches. They deducted my bed
and board. Even took out for my gloves.

106
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:19,207
Yeah, the railroad will shave you
six ways to Sunday, George.

107
00:24:19,568 --> 00:24:23,451
Why call this a factory? The railroad
is everything. Both sides of the track

108
00:24:28,043 --> 00:24:29,245
Looks like rain.

109
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,662
Have you ever been to Montreal?

110
00:24:34,745 --> 00:24:37,411
Me?
─ Listen ..

111
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:43,352
You know a man can afford those luxuries,
if he's willing to take a few chances.

112
00:24:43,592 --> 00:24:45,808
Well sure .. sure! Yep ..

113
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:53,506
First thing we got to do is, we
got to get you a good horse.

114
00:25:01,123 --> 00:25:02,588
Get a horse?

115
00:25:06,146 --> 00:25:08,418
I never had a horse.
I don't know how to ride one.

116
00:25:08,991 --> 00:25:11,282
You'll learn.
─ Sure will.

117
00:25:12,906 --> 00:25:14,005
Learn to ride.

118
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:37,697
Wait for my signal, then pull ahead.

119
00:25:53,631 --> 00:25:55,312
Hurry up son, bust her loose.

120
00:26:35,921 --> 00:26:39,088
You tell him to open that door
and throw out any weapons.

121
00:26:41,448 --> 00:26:43,029
Open up Herb!

122
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,175
Is that you, Nat?
─ Yep.

123
00:26:47,485 --> 00:26:48,752
What's going on?

124
00:26:50,335 --> 00:26:53,569
I think we're being robbed.
─ You <i>are</i> being robbed!

125
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:57,319
Now open the damned door, or
we'll blow it off with dynamite.

126
00:26:57,573 --> 00:26:59,197
Do they have dynamite, Nat?

127
00:27:00,634 --> 00:27:02,296
Most certaïnly do, Herb.

128
00:27:12,568 --> 00:27:15,303
I want the registered pouch .. now!

129
00:27:16,956 --> 00:27:19,892
Back up .. way back!

130
00:27:27,307 --> 00:27:28,396
Goodnight.

131
00:27:53,774 --> 00:27:55,708
Now you be careful backing up.

132
00:27:59,813 --> 00:28:02,637
Must be more than a thousand
dollars in real money right here.

133
00:28:03,644 --> 00:28:07,219
The gold dust must be
worth five, ten thousand.

134
00:28:08,328 --> 00:28:10,112
We can buy our own railroad.

135
00:28:11,127 --> 00:28:13,738
Well, for the time being,
we're not going to buy anything.

136
00:28:15,804 --> 00:28:19,267
What do you mean?
─ We'll just draw attention to ourselves.

137
00:28:19,878 --> 00:28:24,357
We'll take some of the
cash .. hide the rest of it.

138
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:31,173
Settle down, Shorty.

139
00:28:31,304 --> 00:28:34,919
It will be midday before they can
get men or horses to the crossing.

140
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:37,267
They won't know which way we went.

141
00:28:38,168 --> 00:28:40,666
What do we do with this stuff?
─ We bury it.

142
00:30:14,934 --> 00:30:16,496
Good morning, sir. Can I help you?

143
00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:21,257
Does Mr Jack Budd
manage this hotel, son?

144
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:24,891
Yes sir. Can I get him for you?
─ That would be great.

145
00:30:26,047 --> 00:30:29,379
Would you tell him
"George Edwards" is here.

146
00:30:29,942 --> 00:30:31,219
Yes, sir.

147
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:07,586
Hello Jack.
─ Oh yes .. "George Edwards".

148
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,990
It's been a long time, but
I've been expecting you.

149
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:14,912
Let's have some coffee.

150
00:31:16,443 --> 00:31:17,917
Do they know it was me?

151
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:21,450
Yeah .. the fingerprint guys
identified you from the CPR.

152
00:31:22,142 --> 00:31:25,182
It seems they're still chasing you for
that messy business down in Oregon.

153
00:31:26,531 --> 00:31:31,250
My men failed to use the engine
crew for shields .. it was bad.

154
00:31:32,463 --> 00:31:34,557
I see you didn't make the
same mistake in Silverdale.

155
00:31:34,754 --> 00:31:39,856
No, we used the Chapman method
there. That's the only reliable way.

156
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:44,353
They say you got away
with $7,000 in gold dust.

157
00:31:45,941 --> 00:31:47,950
A .. fraction of that.

158
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:54,871
They always stretch the truth, Jack.

159
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,732
Shorty and I need a place
to lie low for a while.

160
00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:09,554
What's in it for me, Bill?
─ I'm sure you'll think of something.

161
00:32:12,607 --> 00:32:13,756
You bet I will.

162
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:29,175
The law thinks you've gone
south, back into Washington.

163
00:32:30,662 --> 00:32:33,854
I'll have to invent a cover-story
to explain you and your partner.

164
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,361
I appreciate this, Jack.

165
00:32:43,477 --> 00:32:45,235
I see you're still working with idiots.

166
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:51,951
Don't mark Shorty down.
He's got plenty of spunk.

167
00:32:52,582 --> 00:32:55,222
Good .. I've got work to go to.

168
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:05,840
Whoa.

169
00:33:08,685 --> 00:33:10,413
Do you own this?
─ Yep.

170
00:33:11,202 --> 00:33:13,145
Won it in a card game
a couple of months back.

171
00:33:16,883 --> 00:33:19,878
The Assay Office says
there's a gold trace.

172
00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:27,705
Louis!

173
00:33:28,705 --> 00:33:32,071
I don't know a thing about mining, Jack.
─ Well, you do now.

174
00:33:32,508 --> 00:33:36,192
I've been telling a story in town that
you're two mining engineers from Idaho.

175
00:33:36,621 --> 00:33:39,541
So, we have to work our
butts off in your mine, huh?

176
00:33:40,827 --> 00:33:43,250
You'd rather be known as
a couple of train robbers?

177
00:33:44,724 --> 00:33:48,461
I brought you some company Louis.
This is George Edwards and ..

178
00:33:49,015 --> 00:33:50,320
That's Shorty Dunn.

179
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,227
Louis Colquhoun, boys.

180
00:34:04,944 --> 00:34:06,606
That man works in your mine?

181
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:10,812
Yeah .. in return for room and
board at the hotel. Same as you.

182
00:34:12,408 --> 00:34:16,154
I know that cough, Jack.
He's got the consumption.

183
00:34:16,648 --> 00:34:20,044
Well, he used to be a schoolteacher back
East. He came out here for his health.

184
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:21,979
He's a good worker.

185
00:34:23,209 --> 00:34:25,687
Well .. the dampness will kill him.

186
00:34:27,293 --> 00:34:29,246
Oh, it's a tough old world.

187
00:34:29,716 --> 00:34:33,131
So, you had better get
to work .. Mr "Edwards".

188
00:35:16,835 --> 00:35:18,467
Do you like oranges, son?

189
00:35:45,997 --> 00:35:48,448
I must insist that you publish it.

190
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:54,813
Your "Letters To The Editor" section is
meant to be a forum for public opinion.

191
00:35:55,414 --> 00:35:56,765
I am a member of that public.

192
00:35:56,963 --> 00:35:58,726
Miss Flanners, I have told you already ..

193
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:03,056
I reserve the right to publish letters
I deem of interest to our readership.

194
00:36:03,309 --> 00:36:06,192
Now .. your letter is of no
interest to people around here.

195
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:07,983
Mr Wilks ..

196
00:36:08,229 --> 00:36:14,801
I refuse to allow your editorial against
the Women's League to go unopposed.

197
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,501
It is absolutely imperative ..

198
00:36:18,627 --> 00:36:21,034
That your readership be informed ..

199
00:36:21,726 --> 00:36:25,458
That women, working in factories,
in this very province ..

200
00:36:26,362 --> 00:36:30,552
Are being paid one third of the wages
being paid to men for the same jobs.

201
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:33,943
Your editorial failed to mention that.

202
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:38,106
People around here don't seem to
share your passion for Trade Unions.

203
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:45,674
Mr Wilks .. Kamloops
is not .. the planet Mars.

204
00:36:46,185 --> 00:36:52,533
We have a transcontinental
railway on the edge of town.

205
00:36:52,893 --> 00:36:57,686
And it brings ideas here, Mr Wilks.
Not just goods and supplies.

206
00:36:58,437 --> 00:37:03,282
It is the purpose of your paper to lead
public opinion, not to curry its favor.

207
00:37:03,731 --> 00:37:10,143
I will not be told my purpose in life by
someone who doesn't understand her own.

208
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:17,890
Mr Wilks.

209
00:37:20,736 --> 00:37:25,236
You have the mentality
of a .. grocery clerk.

210
00:37:27,858 --> 00:37:28,956
Thank you!

211
00:37:35,566 --> 00:37:39,112
I'd like to purchase some
back-copies from your newspapers.

212
00:37:39,397 --> 00:37:40,746
Certainly, sir.

213
00:37:41,563 --> 00:37:43,969
Nothing wrong with her,
a husband wouldn't fix.

214
00:37:48,677 --> 00:37:53,804
Law agencies in British Columbia and
the states of Washington and Oregon.

215
00:37:55,455 --> 00:37:59,243
Confirmed that the search for
William Miner and his accomplice ..

216
00:37:59,881 --> 00:38:03,661
Is concentrated on the Whatcom
County, Washington area.

217
00:38:04,272 --> 00:38:08,945
Where Miner is known to have resided
following his release from San Quentin.

218
00:38:09,771 --> 00:38:12,274
They figure that Bill Miner's just us.

219
00:38:13,632 --> 00:38:16,403
I don't believe Miner could have
planned it any better than I did.

220
00:38:16,703 --> 00:38:19,323
Oh don't get me wrong George,
you did great for a nobody.

221
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,487
There is more here, Shorty

222
00:38:23,724 --> 00:38:27,076
The identity of Miner's
accomplice remains unknown.

223
00:38:27,801 --> 00:38:30,012
The train crew described this man as ..

224
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:33,420
Short, dirty, nervous
and unintelligent.

225
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,028
Hell .. I've never been
nervous in my life.

226
00:39:06,736 --> 00:39:07,855
Hello there.

227
00:39:23,492 --> 00:39:24,938
That's a Police Officer.

228
00:39:28,007 --> 00:39:30,312
Relax. We aren't breaking any laws.

229
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,368
Hello there.
─ Morning to you.

230
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,204
You must be the men
working for Jack Budd?

231
00:39:40,364 --> 00:39:43,295
Yes we are. This is Shorty Dunn.
and I'm George Edwards.

232
00:39:45,277 --> 00:39:47,549
I guess I gave you a
bit of a start back there.

233
00:39:48,909 --> 00:39:51,350
I guess you're our local
Law Enforcement officer?

234
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:53,679
That's correct. I'm Corporal Fern.

235
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,022
Are you .. ?

236
00:40:01,177 --> 00:40:03,083
Are you having any
luck with this old mine?

237
00:40:03,308 --> 00:40:06,144
Oh, a few traces of
zinc and lead so far ..

238
00:40:06,351 --> 00:40:09,706
Yeah, I told Jack Budd this ridge runs
the wrong direction for gold seams.

239
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,735
But I guess there is no reasoning
with a man and his hunches.

240
00:40:14,805 --> 00:40:16,288
Well, that's about right.

241
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:24,015
Though they've had some success with the
same type of formation, down Idaho way.

242
00:40:24,926 --> 00:40:27,217
Yeah, Jack told me
you were up from Idaho.

243
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:30,191
Where, exactly?
─ Kellogg.

244
00:40:33,328 --> 00:40:36,276
Well .. I was just passing by
and I thought I should meet you.

245
00:40:37,528 --> 00:40:39,622
You'll be careful with
those explosives, I hope.

246
00:40:40,101 --> 00:40:44,974
Yes sir. Caution makes for longer life.
─ That it does.

247
00:40:46,869 --> 00:40:49,310
Well .. good-day, gentlemen.

248
00:40:50,362 --> 00:40:51,366
Good day.

249
00:41:02,182 --> 00:41:05,431
Are you two in some kind of trouble
with the law?          ─ Nope.

250
00:41:06,726 --> 00:41:10,028
Shorty just don't like
policemen .. that's all.

251
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:15,338
I know a man down at Cash Creek who
would pay a nice price for good horses.

252
00:41:17,606 --> 00:41:20,677
Well .. rustling isn't my line.

253
00:41:22,282 --> 00:41:25,278
I'm sure you'll enjoy it a lot more
than working in that mine, Bill.

254
00:41:29,012 --> 00:41:30,783
Are you going to help us steal them?

255
00:41:35,866 --> 00:41:37,111
I didn't think so.

256
00:41:38,902 --> 00:41:41,728
You're real good at figuring
out the angles, but ..

257
00:41:43,259 --> 00:41:46,281
You don't have much stomach
for the risky parts, do you.

258
00:41:47,013 --> 00:41:49,935
Well, that's how come I spent more
time outside prison than in it.

259
00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:00,782
Three-way split .. you, me and Shorty.

260
00:42:04,568 --> 00:42:05,808
Fifty-fifty.

261
00:42:07,995 --> 00:42:11,003
Three ways .. take it or leave it.

262
00:42:13,469 --> 00:42:17,028
Alright .. it's a deal.
When will you do it?

263
00:42:17,779 --> 00:42:21,864
Well .. I'll have to have
a little time to plan it out.

264
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,739
I'll see you.

265
00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:28,257
[ opera music ]

266
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:43,856
[ opera music: loud ]

267
00:43:47,187 --> 00:43:52,098
I was attracted by the sound of your
music.          ─ I know who you are.

268
00:43:53,489 --> 00:43:56,294
You are the man in the
newspaper office, last week.

269
00:43:57,068 --> 00:44:01,296
My name is George Edwards.
─ How long have you been lurking about?

270
00:44:03,089 --> 00:44:04,564
I really wasn't lurking.

271
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,808
Isn't that an aria from "Martha"?

272
00:44:13,171 --> 00:44:14,485
You know opera?

273
00:44:15,272 --> 00:44:20,969
Not well, but I did attend that one.
A long time ago, in Chicago.

274
00:44:22,244 --> 00:44:26,517
My name is Katherine Flynn.
─ It's a real pleasure to meet you.

275
00:44:30,311 --> 00:44:31,954
Thank you.

276
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:35,704
Would I be intruding if I
stayed to hear your record?

277
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:38,446
I suppose not.

278
00:44:47,628 --> 00:44:50,999
I admired the way you handled
that publisher, Miss Flynn.

279
00:44:51,992 --> 00:44:54,255
A lot of good it did me Mr Edwards.

280
00:44:56,804 --> 00:44:59,926
In this country you're not taken
seriously unless you're ..

281
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:05,069
Caucasian, protestant,
and most of all .. male.

282
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:08,447
Well, sometimes even that ain't enough.

283
00:45:11,029 --> 00:45:13,586
You have a point there, Mr Edwards.

284
00:45:16,098 --> 00:45:18,401
So you left Kentucky
when you were Twenty .. why?

285
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:22,949
Well, it was kind of dull on the
farm, and I wanted adventure.

286
00:45:24,808 --> 00:45:27,490
And adventure found you.
─ Yes it did.

287
00:45:28,232 --> 00:45:31,710
I was with the U.S. Cavalry in
the Arizona Indian wars.

288
00:45:33,744 --> 00:45:35,588
On the side of the
oppressors, Mr Edwards.

289
00:45:36,771 --> 00:45:41,175
Well, I didn't see it quite like that at
the time. Of course, I was very young.

290
00:45:42,154 --> 00:45:44,060
Not near as wise as you.

291
00:45:48,887 --> 00:45:51,647
So then you went into the mining
business, yes?             ─ Uhuh.

292
00:45:53,014 --> 00:45:57,778
But .. you don't seem like a man
who's spent his life underground.

293
00:45:58,737 --> 00:45:59,854
Thank you.

294
00:46:03,253 --> 00:46:07,629
Of course, my parents were mortified
when one asked to marry me.

295
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:14,845
I, on the contrary, was
ecstatic at such good fortune.

296
00:46:15,694 --> 00:46:17,262
Ecstatic?

297
00:46:18,107 --> 00:46:19,525
Of course.

298
00:46:20,962 --> 00:46:23,136
I never wanted to be
like everybody else.

299
00:46:24,276 --> 00:46:26,013
Well, you're certainly not.

300
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:28,614
Thank you.

301
00:46:31,963 --> 00:46:33,390
A tomato, Mr Edwärds.

302
00:46:35,897 --> 00:46:39,362
I never concurred with the
idea that they're poisonous.

303
00:46:46,986 --> 00:46:49,991
I found my passion in
the art of photography.

304
00:46:51,841 --> 00:46:54,760
And much to my father's dismay ..

305
00:46:55,755 --> 00:46:57,953
Elected to make my
own way in this world.

306
00:47:00,596 --> 00:47:04,116
So, five years ago I .. boarded
a train and came West.

307
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:10,080
Well there .. isn't much out
here to take pictures of.

308
00:47:11,675 --> 00:47:13,272
You're quite wrong Mr Edwards.

309
00:47:16,342 --> 00:47:18,633
A country in transition.

310
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:22,014
Filled with beauty.

311
00:47:24,567 --> 00:47:26,173
And despair.

312
00:47:28,585 --> 00:47:35,380
You might be .. shocked at some of the
injustices I've recorded with my camera.

313
00:47:37,224 --> 00:47:41,927
Well, perhaps someday, you'll be kind
enough to let me see your pictures.

314
00:47:49,068 --> 00:47:53,012
Your face has fascinating flames
Mr Edwards.         ─ Uhuh.

315
00:47:54,017 --> 00:47:57,902
You would photograph well.
─ Well, I'm kind of superstitious ..

316
00:47:59,178 --> 00:48:00,868
About getting my picture taken.

317
00:48:02,327 --> 00:48:03,858
A man who likes opera?

318
00:48:04,788 --> 00:48:07,382
I'm much less worldly than you think.

319
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:12,058
Are you indeed?

320
00:48:20,243 --> 00:48:23,584
"Do you remember sweet Betsy from Pike."

321
00:48:24,684 --> 00:48:27,830
"Crossed the big mountain
with her lover, Ike."

322
00:48:29,162 --> 00:48:32,345
"Two yoke of oxen, a big yellow dog."

323
00:48:33,294 --> 00:48:37,369
"A tall Shanghai rooster,
and a one-spotted hog."

324
00:48:38,867 --> 00:48:43,613
"Toodle-dang-fa-ta-do
diddle-dang-fol-do-day."

325
00:48:46,419 --> 00:48:49,733
"They Reached a big desert,
and Betsy give out."

326
00:48:50,504 --> 00:48:53,697
"Down on the sand,
they were rolling about."

327
00:48:54,709 --> 00:48:58,015
"Ike in great terror
looked on in surprise."

328
00:48:58,503 --> 00:49:02,766
"Saying: Betsy, get up.
You'll get sand in your eyes."

329
00:49:04,476 --> 00:49:08,082
"Ike and Sweet Betsy attended a dance."

330
00:49:09,011 --> 00:49:12,740
"Ike wore a pair of his
Pike County pants."

331
00:49:13,652 --> 00:49:17,210
"Sweet Betsy was dressed
up in ribbons and rings."

332
00:49:18,272 --> 00:49:22,425
"Says Ike: You're an angel,
but where are your wings?"

333
00:49:23,733 --> 00:49:28,819
"Toodle-dang-fa-ta-do
diddle-dang-fo-do-day."

334
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,410
"A miner come up. Said: will
you dance with me?"

335
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:37,746
"I will you old hoss, if you
don't make too free."

336
00:49:39,427 --> 00:49:43,571
"And I'll tell you the reason,
you want to know why?"

337
00:49:44,266 --> 00:49:47,793
"Doggone you, I'm chock
full of strong alkali."

338
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:53,228
"Farewell Piper County,
farewell for a while."

339
00:49:54,289 --> 00:49:59,359
"We'll come back again when
we've panned out our pile."

340
00:50:13,307 --> 00:50:15,213
Where did you get this scar?

341
00:50:18,462 --> 00:50:20,492
I got knifed in a saloon.

342
00:50:23,739 --> 00:50:24,960
Why?

343
00:50:25,854 --> 00:50:28,675
Oh, the men I worked with
didn't really need a reason.

344
00:50:34,357 --> 00:50:36,592
And where did you get this ballerina?

345
00:50:38,176 --> 00:50:39,240
Denver.

346
00:50:42,411 --> 00:50:43,581
And this?

347
00:50:45,157 --> 00:50:48,659
San Francisco .. it flies.

348
00:51:23,407 --> 00:51:27,470
I uh .. I apologize for asking
you to do this Miss Flynn.

349
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:32,146
Particularly on Christmas morning,
but I'm afraid it's necessary.

350
00:51:34,587 --> 00:51:36,290
Are they all dead, Corporal?

351
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:40,516
They're dead alright .. except
for the husband, of course.

352
00:51:41,761 --> 00:51:44,785
He took off somewhere
after he .. did it.

353
00:51:50,955 --> 00:51:55,058
They hate the cold weather. Every
year, one or two will suicide.

354
00:51:56,138 --> 00:51:57,912
It's the first murder I've seen here.

355
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:01,714
He used a knife.

356
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:08,186
He must have taken it with him.
I don't see it anywhere. Do you?

357
00:52:43,946 --> 00:52:45,906
It's a sad sight Corporal.

358
00:52:51,974 --> 00:52:54,972
Damned Chinamen. Never understand
what's going on in their heads.

359
00:52:58,077 --> 00:53:02,731
I wouldn't be too harsh on them .. you
know they're a world away from home.

360
00:53:13,582 --> 00:53:14,981
Looks like he's slowing down.

361
00:53:53,283 --> 00:53:57,893
Must have cut his throat back there.
─ Then he ran until he hit the fence.

362
00:54:03,977 --> 00:54:06,109
I guess he saved us
the bother of a trial.

363
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,032
Good afternoon George.
─ Good afternoon.

364
00:54:13,361 --> 00:54:16,502
Congratulations on your promotion.
─ Thank you.

365
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:23,469
That's really quite an accomplishment
for a man as young as you.

366
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:26,061
Thank you George.

367
00:54:28,713 --> 00:54:29,976
There.

368
00:54:32,347 --> 00:54:34,966
I guess the detachment
is being enlarged.

369
00:54:37,027 --> 00:54:38,322
I'll have two men under me.

370
00:54:38,519 --> 00:54:41,910
I'm sure you'll measure up to
your responsibility .. Sergeant.

371
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:53,159
It's a fascinating process.
─ Yes it is.

372
00:55:49,224 --> 00:55:52,498
Move them along, Shorty.
There's a train coming.

373
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:39,242
Work training. That's the reason she
was running so close behind the others.

374
00:57:40,764 --> 00:57:44,645
I tell you one thing. Robbing trains is
a lot easier than rustling horses.

375
00:57:45,468 --> 00:57:48,120
What time we get back to that?
─ In the Spring.

376
00:57:48,824 --> 00:57:52,844
We got to work our butt here all Winter?
─ Well, it's safe here in Kamloops.

377
00:57:54,443 --> 00:57:58,949
Besides .. I'm getting to where
I kind of like this place.

378
00:58:00,099 --> 00:58:02,624
Slaving away in that mine,
and rustling these horses.

379
00:58:03,028 --> 00:58:05,582
We got all we need buried
under a rock down by the mission

380
00:58:06,556 --> 00:58:10,183
Well .. we got to think
about the future, Shorty.

381
00:58:13,692 --> 00:58:15,611
Let's get these horses.

382
00:58:59,943 --> 00:59:03,874
I'm afraid you're mistaken .. if Miner
were in this area, I'd know about it.

383
00:59:04,701 --> 00:59:08,861
Not necessarily .. he's
clever at false identities.

384
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:13,601
And this region is filled with people
who think of him as some sort of hero.

385
00:59:15,094 --> 00:59:16,744
My opinion stands, sir.

386
00:59:18,512 --> 00:59:19,827
Indeed.

387
00:59:20,529 --> 00:59:24,578
I take it then, that you are experienced
in dealing with major criminals?

388
00:59:24,982 --> 00:59:26,343
No, I am not.

389
00:59:27,104 --> 00:59:31,254
This is my jurisdiction sir, and I'm not
obliged to take your word for anything.

390
00:59:32,362 --> 00:59:35,367
I don't mean to condescend, Sergeant.

391
00:59:35,883 --> 00:59:39,367
But I have pursued this particular
criminal for some time now.

392
00:59:39,583 --> 00:59:42,165
And I know how cunning
and dangerous he can be.

393
00:59:45,321 --> 00:59:46,344
Dangerous?

394
00:59:47,795 --> 00:59:49,391
That's not what I've heard.

395
00:59:50,809 --> 00:59:54,159
Now you sound like one of his admirers.
─ Not at all.

396
00:59:55,198 --> 00:59:56,983
But I have more important
things to do ..

397
00:59:57,123 --> 00:59:59,649
than cater to the whims of
an American detective agency.

398
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:05,304
Your Superintendent in New
Westminster does not agree with you.

399
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,628
Why didn't you simply show
me that at the beginning?

400
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:27,475
Coöperation is preferable
to coercion .. Sergeant.

401
01:00:31,172 --> 01:00:33,144
What would you like me to do?

402
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:37,760
This is an accurate description of
Miner, provided by San Quentin.

403
01:00:37,975 --> 01:00:39,630
Very well, I will circulate it.

404
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:43,421
No Sergeant .. we don't want
to set him running again.

405
01:00:44,551 --> 01:00:48,269
I simply want you to keep an eye out
for anyone who matches that description.

406
01:00:48,879 --> 01:00:51,614
And notify New Westminster
if you should spot him.

407
01:00:58,581 --> 01:01:00,200
What is it, Sergeant?

408
01:01:02,465 --> 01:01:03,745
Nothing.

409
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:08,334
He could be any number
of older men around here.

410
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:13,532
I'll wager you he is the only one
with a bluebird tattooed right here.

411
01:01:15,482 --> 01:01:19,401
I don't recall seeing such a mark on
anyone, but I'll keep my eyes open.

412
01:01:21,478 --> 01:01:23,462
Not for me, Sergeant.

413
01:01:25,153 --> 01:01:26,678
For us.

414
01:01:32,212 --> 01:01:35,305
We <i>are</i> on the same side. Are we not?

415
01:01:45,951 --> 01:01:49,014
Move a little this way,
so I can see the stripes.

416
01:01:50,283 --> 01:01:51,701
A little more.

417
01:01:55,762 --> 01:01:59,750
There .. there .. that's perfect.

418
01:02:02,482 --> 01:02:04,741
I apologize for the rush Miss Flynn.

419
01:02:09,173 --> 01:02:11,274
But I'd like to get it
off to my parents.

420
01:02:12,906 --> 01:02:16,967
Of course, I understand .. it's not
every day you become a Sergeant.

421
01:02:20,364 --> 01:02:21,823
If I catch Bill Miner ..

422
01:02:22,257 --> 01:02:25,555
I'll probably be kicked up to Inspector
before that photograph is ready.

423
01:02:26,541 --> 01:02:28,524
Are you quite comfortable, Sergeant?

424
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:32,796
I beg your pardon.
─ Smile.

425
01:02:34,134 --> 01:02:37,125
I'll have a print for you the day
after tomorrow. How's that?

426
01:02:38,693 --> 01:02:39,980
That's fine.

427
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:43,118
The uh ..

428
01:02:45,582 --> 01:02:48,235
The Pinkertons are certain
he's hiding out in this area.

429
01:02:49,407 --> 01:02:51,135
Maybe even right here in Kamloops.

430
01:02:54,779 --> 01:02:56,998
Well, I certainly hope you'll
catch him Sergeant.

431
01:02:58,341 --> 01:03:00,941
Please don't move .. not an inch.

432
01:03:02,135 --> 01:03:03,666
Sorry, Miss Flynn.

433
01:03:11,112 --> 01:03:12,801
Do you really hope I catch him?

434
01:03:14,072 --> 01:03:15,899
For your sake, I most certainly do.

435
01:03:16,498 --> 01:03:18,223
A lot of people like him.

436
01:03:19,326 --> 01:03:21,556
That's because he only
steals from the railway.

437
01:03:23,768 --> 01:03:26,140
There .. I'm just about ready.

438
01:03:26,508 --> 01:03:28,745
In a way, I hope I don't
have to arrest him.

439
01:03:29,378 --> 01:03:32,674
It might make me unpopular
around here .. with some people.

440
01:03:34,883 --> 01:03:37,324
Hold still .. give me a big smile.

441
01:03:39,218 --> 01:03:43,361
He won't be difficult to recognize. Not
with a ballet girl tattooed on his arm.

442
01:03:48,417 --> 01:03:50,135
Not another word, Sergeant.

443
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:57,065
So, he checked out of the hotel and
left town, huh?           ─ Yeah.

444
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:02,453
He drove off, after meeting with Fernie.
─ Well, we can quit worrying now.

445
01:04:03,354 --> 01:04:05,537
You must be getting
soft in the head, Bill.

446
01:04:06,393 --> 01:04:10,078
The Pinkerton man wouldn't be sniffing
around here unless he has your scent.

447
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:12,500
Well, that's a hasty conclusion.

448
01:04:16,641 --> 01:04:18,263
It's time you moved on.

449
01:04:19,636 --> 01:04:22,545
I .. I never knew you were
concerned about my safety.

450
01:04:23,521 --> 01:04:25,559
I'm just trying to protect
my own situation.

451
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:29,691
Well, I can assure you I won't
do anything to harm that.

452
01:04:37,842 --> 01:04:38,781
Kate.

453
01:04:40,724 --> 01:04:42,528
Can I talk to you?

454
01:04:56,102 --> 01:05:02,017
In two or three days .. I'm going
to be leaving Kamloops for good.

455
01:05:08,401 --> 01:05:10,664
When we made our plans.

456
01:05:12,598 --> 01:05:14,438
There was something I left out.

457
01:05:16,335 --> 01:05:18,541
I never intended to tell you.

458
01:05:22,588 --> 01:05:25,565
Ah .. I'm not the man you think I am.

459
01:05:26,748 --> 01:05:29,940
And you lied about your feelings
for me too?         ─ Oh, no.

460
01:05:32,090 --> 01:05:34,541
You mean more to me than anything.

461
01:05:35,208 --> 01:05:38,447
You've got to believe that.
─ Are you quite sure?

462
01:05:39,795 --> 01:05:41,841
No matter what else you think about me.

463
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,858
I've been thinking
about it all afternoon.

464
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:52,038
I've decided I'm .. quite sure too.

465
01:05:56,318 --> 01:05:58,881
So the rest of it is
of little importance.

466
01:06:03,083 --> 01:06:04,476
Then you know?

467
01:06:07,158 --> 01:06:08,476
Talking.

468
01:06:11,594 --> 01:06:12,720
Fernie.

469
01:06:15,903 --> 01:06:19,141
I imagine he was .. giving
you a chance to leave.

470
01:06:19,425 --> 01:06:21,997
Before he was forced to arrest you.

471
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:26,683
I went to the station.

472
01:06:28,382 --> 01:06:31,518
And I reserved two tickets
on the Eastbound train.

473
01:06:34,651 --> 01:06:36,313
Disembark in Winnipeg.

474
01:06:38,476 --> 01:06:40,748
Then we make our connections to Chicago.

475
01:06:42,379 --> 01:06:45,422
Or New York .. if you prefer.

476
01:06:53,675 --> 01:06:56,309
I can't go with you .. not now.

477
01:06:59,675 --> 01:07:02,811
It would just make it easy
for the police to find me.

478
01:07:08,229 --> 01:07:09,506
Kate, listen.

479
01:07:10,567 --> 01:07:15,259
I want you on that train. Go to Chicago.
─ Why?

480
01:07:16,154 --> 01:07:19,078
I'll go someplace. I'll
throw them off my trail.

481
01:07:19,975 --> 01:07:22,201
And when it's safe, I'll join you.

482
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:27,384
You will come?
─ You bet I will.

483
01:07:28,595 --> 01:07:30,182
You do believe me?

484
01:07:34,511 --> 01:07:36,492
I believe <i>in</i> you.

485
01:08:25,055 --> 01:08:27,156
I was looking for you
a little while ago.

486
01:08:27,356 --> 01:08:29,809
Oh, me and Louis just
shared a bottle at the stable.

487
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:35,368
What's all this here?

488
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:39,840
What's the point George? You
ain't never going to use it no more.

489
01:08:40,826 --> 01:08:41,961
No?

490
01:08:42,775 --> 01:08:45,920
Seems to me, all you want to do is
cozy up that picture-taking lady.

491
01:08:47,557 --> 01:08:51,838
Since when did you become an expert
on affairs of the heart, Shorty?

492
01:08:52,331 --> 01:08:55,473
The fact is, I'd say she's just about
made a gelding out of you.

493
01:08:59,345 --> 01:09:02,190
You moronic little son-of-a-bitch.

494
01:09:23,581 --> 01:09:26,232
I told you I'd tell you
when the time is right.

495
01:09:28,709 --> 01:09:30,576
Now the time is right.

496
01:12:12,109 --> 01:12:14,914
How much longer?      ─ An hour and ten.
─ What if it don't stop?

497
01:12:15,454 --> 01:12:18,822
It will stop. They have to take on
water for the up-gradient.

498
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:27,184
I ought to go down to the
???? They're closing up.

499
01:12:28,475 --> 01:12:32,899
Before you go, there is something
I have to tell both of you.

500
01:12:34,552 --> 01:12:37,103
It isn't safe for me any
longer in Kamloops.

501
01:12:38,475 --> 01:12:43,566
I'm not going back and .. I advise
that you don't go back either.

502
01:12:52,967 --> 01:12:55,194
You're Bill Miner .. aren't you?

503
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,765
I am.

504
01:14:08,735 --> 01:14:10,613
What are you two doing in here?

505
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,628
We're robbing this train!

506
01:14:55,799 --> 01:14:57,213
What's up? Hose bust?

507
01:14:57,512 --> 01:15:00,280
This is no hose bust, it's a hold-up!
─ Throw down your guns!

508
01:15:00,534 --> 01:15:02,149
This is the baggage car.

509
01:15:04,285 --> 01:15:07,004
We've cut the wrong car.
─ They all look the same in the dark.

510
01:15:07,276 --> 01:15:09,558
Do you have any mail?
─ Some.

511
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:21,438
I want the box.
─ What box?

512
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:26,660
The Express Box.
─ It's on the car you left behind.

513
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,355
The Frisco pouch?

514
01:15:35,899 --> 01:15:39,073
It doesn't come this way, sir.
─ Which way does it come?

515
01:15:40,848 --> 01:15:42,318
Via Mission Junction, sir.

516
01:15:46,138 --> 01:15:48,936
Is that registered mail there?
─ Yes, sir.

517
01:15:49,321 --> 01:15:50,745
Put it on the table.

518
01:16:03,651 --> 01:16:06,431
Is that the money package?
─ I don't know, sir.

519
01:16:06,918 --> 01:16:08,474
What do you know?

520
01:16:13,926 --> 01:16:15,293
Now you open it.

521
01:16:41,323 --> 01:16:43,060
That may come in handy.

522
01:16:59,187 --> 01:17:00,943
Let's go. I'm done.

523
01:17:02,229 --> 01:17:04,295
What about this?
─ We don't need it now.

524
01:17:09,281 --> 01:17:11,507
What is it?
─ ????

525
01:18:56,963 --> 01:18:58,363
Hello there.

526
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:07,307
Mounties.

527
01:19:12,105 --> 01:19:13,421
Good day.

528
01:19:14,959 --> 01:19:16,152
Good day, sir.

529
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:19,845
We didn't hear you when
you slipped in on us.

530
01:19:20,619 --> 01:19:22,996
I'm Sergeant Wilson.
North West Mounted Police.

531
01:19:24,305 --> 01:19:26,188
I must ask you to identify yourselves.

532
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:31,052
You boys are kind of out
of your territory, aren't you?

533
01:19:34,579 --> 01:19:36,845
I must ask you to identify yourselves.

534
01:19:40,412 --> 01:19:44,853
I'm George Edwards, that's Shorty
Dunn .. and this is Louis Colquhoun.

535
01:19:46,723 --> 01:19:48,301
What are you men doing out here?

536
01:19:49,615 --> 01:19:50,977
Prospecting.

537
01:19:52,817 --> 01:19:54,010
Prospecting?

538
01:19:55,042 --> 01:19:56,197
Where?

539
01:19:57,352 --> 01:20:01,052
Over there .. east of Douglas Lake.

540
01:20:03,352 --> 01:20:07,212
Not north?
─ No sir .. east.

541
01:20:12,017 --> 01:20:14,327
You answer the descriptions
of the men we're hunting.

542
01:20:15,566 --> 01:20:17,021
Who might they be?

543
01:20:18,596 --> 01:20:23,232
The train robbers. The ones who
robbed the CPR at Duck's Siding.

544
01:20:25,847 --> 01:20:28,209
Do we really look like train robbers?

545
01:20:38,603 --> 01:20:42,618
Those gold pans .. they don't
look much used, to me.

546
01:20:44,074 --> 01:20:49,440
We're not panning .. we're
surveying .. and staking.

547
01:20:51,844 --> 01:20:55,525
And .. this is the first we've
heard of any train robbers.

548
01:21:12,475 --> 01:21:15,601
Nonetheless, I must take
you for the train robbers.

549
01:21:20,832 --> 01:21:22,710
Look boys .. we're done!

550
01:21:28,588 --> 01:21:30,977
You do that .. and I'll
blow your head off.

551
01:21:59,142 --> 01:22:00,661
That was stupid.

552
01:22:02,259 --> 01:22:04,159
You could have been shot in the head.

553
01:22:09,638 --> 01:22:12,389
I wish to God I had been
shot through the head.

554
01:24:21,583 --> 01:24:24,153
George, will you step out please.

555
01:24:29,288 --> 01:24:33,543
My men treating you well?
─ Just fine.       ─ Thank you, sir.

556
01:24:34,985 --> 01:24:40,233
This is Mr Seavey. He's a
Pinkerton agent. Important.

557
01:24:43,553 --> 01:24:47,363
Hello Bill. I've been looking forward
to meeting you for a long time.

558
01:24:48,185 --> 01:24:51,072
The name is Edwards, sir.
George Edwards.

559
01:24:54,471 --> 01:24:56,184
Is it indeed, sir?

560
01:25:12,127 --> 01:25:13,724
Louis Colquhoun.

561
01:25:14,463 --> 01:25:16,083
William Dunn.

562
01:25:17,809 --> 01:25:21,634
William Miner .. also known
as George Edwards.

563
01:25:23,289 --> 01:25:26,721
You have been tried and found guilty
of the crime of armed robbery.

564
01:25:28,067 --> 01:25:30,630
This court sentences you as follows.

565
01:25:32,895 --> 01:25:36,427
Louis Colquhoun .. fifteen years.

566
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:44,009
William Dunn .. twenty-five years.

567
01:25:47,788 --> 01:25:51,896
And William Miner .. also
known as George Edwards.

568
01:25:52,624 --> 01:25:55,934
You are sentenced to twenty-five years.

569
01:26:04,188 --> 01:26:06,007
This court is now adjourned.

570
01:31:55,756 --> 01:31:57,061
