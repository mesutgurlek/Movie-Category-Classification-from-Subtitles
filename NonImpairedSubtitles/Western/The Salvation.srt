00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Subtitled by BRUNO October 2014.

2
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
After the Danish defeat in the 1864 war, crossed Jon
and his brother Atlantic to start fresh.

3
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,000
In seven years they struggled to find
foothold in the unknown country.

4
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:36,500
7 years, where Jon missed his
wife, Marie, and their son.

5
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,000
7 years of family separation.
The year is 1871 The country is America.

6
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Kresten, it's your father.

7
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,000
Welcome Marie.
Thank you.

8
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,300
How nice to see you.
You too.

9
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,000
Say hello to your uncle, Peter.

10
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,800
Good day.

11
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,800
I'd better see to go.
So do not lose your place on the stage.

12
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,600
Are not you going with us?

13
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,000
Uh, no.

14
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,600
Peter likes to stay
inside the city once in a while.

15
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,200
Hey.
Hello, ma'am.

16
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Where are you going?

17
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,000
My wife does not speak American.
She must learn it.

18
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,400
You look like them not only.
You also sound like them.

19
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,800
It comes in also.

20
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,200
Sorry, but it's been a mistake.
You must take the next coach.

21
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,600
But we paid for this trip.
Sorry, ma'am.

22
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,200
How to treat not
his fellow men.

23
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,000
We have traveled for weeks.
Sorry ma'am, but must stand by.

24
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,400
Do as he says.

25
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,000
Are there many animals?
Yes, there are many different animals.

26
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,700
There are foxes, there are bears, there are deer.
Are there bears where we live?

27
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,000
Where we live?
No, there is not any.

28
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,500
But if there was one ...

29
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,300
Then we shoot it and rip it.
And sell it down in the city.

30
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,600
Is there a town nearby?
Yeah, not so far from us.

31
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,000
We can be back there in a day.

32
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Kresten ...
You should not be worried, right?

33
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,000
It's a really nice place.

34
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,500
And I've built,
so there is room for all of us.

35
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
When are you really big enough
to take out hunting?

36
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,000
I think actually,
it is tomorrow.

37
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,500
If you fancy.

38
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:26,000
Sorry, I have not had a drink in three years.
I had forgotten what it does to one.

39
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,800
Out here when offered a drink, ma'am ...
So drinking man.

40
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,400
Marie, take a sip.

41
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,300
It's get em to do here.

42
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,000
You do not have much,
to say, right?

43
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,000
I like that.

44
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,300
My own princess does not say a word.
She is dumb.

45
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,600
Indians cut her
tongue when she was little.

46
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,800
They were probably tired of hearing that she screamed,
when they killed her parents.

47
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,900
What's your name?

48
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
My wife's name is Marie.

49
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,600
It's a beautiful name.

50
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,700
Are you just get here?

51
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,400
My wife and son have just come.
I've been here a while.

52
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,600
It is not easy for anyone,
to be outside a woman, for so long.

53
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,300
Boy, is this hot.

54
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,600
You're not used
to the heat, well, Marie?

55
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,100
No, you're probably not.

56
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,100
There is always a solution.

57
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,400
Let's look at the goods.

58
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,000
Stop it.

59
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,400
What a hot little flower.

60
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,000
Stop it.

61
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,500
Are you threatening me?

62
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,400
No, I'm saying that you need to keep
hands away and behave yourself.

63
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It does sound as you threaten me.

64
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,100
That's how I hear it.
What say you, Lester?

65
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,000
Yes.

66
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,300
I'm not trying to threaten anyone,
I'm just ...

67
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What will you do now?

68
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You can not do anything.

69
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,100
Come here!

70
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,500
Nothing.
You can not do a damn thing.

71
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,100
Sit still!

72
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Bite his ear.
Marie, bite his ear.

73
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,500
Do not be afraid.

74
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,400
Kresten, roof turret.

75
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Do not be afraid.

76
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,000
Just take it.

77
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,600
And stay down, Kresten.
No, stay down. Stay down, Kresten!

78
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,000
Lower turret.

79
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,800
Lower it!

80
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,000
For fuck's sake.
You I do not like.

81
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,300
You have 5 seconds to get off.

82
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,400
Is that clear?
A ...

83
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,100
Two!

84
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,400
Three.

85
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,000
Marie ...

86
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,000
She's not dead!
She is doing it!

87
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,500
Wait, wait!

88
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,000
She is not dead.

89
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,700
Wait, wait.

90
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,000
I did not touch the boy.

91
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,000
Who did it?

92
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,000
I have not seen them before.

93
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,000
Strangers.

94
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's a sad day, sir. Delarue.

95
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:04,000
But we must remember that no one in this peaceful town,
involved in the gruesome killing your men.

96
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,000
Where is my brother?

97
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,000
Your brother?

98
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,000
Mayor, Keane?
Yes?

99
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50.000
Make sure he does not stink of booze,
when the princess sees him.

100
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,000
Course.

101
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:57,000
Bring him to my house,
so do I, that he is being nice.

102
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,100
Take him there.

103
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,300
Did you catch the killer?

104
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,800
Mr. Delarue, I can say with certainty
that this is not here.

105
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,500
I want to know who killed my brother.

106
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
There are no surviving witnesses.

107
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,000
Competitors and gunfighter
were also killed.

108
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
We lost two men today.

109
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,000
One was my brother.

110
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,900
I will give you two hours
to find the man who did it.

111
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,200
And the sheriff ...
I want that man alive.

112
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,100
It is impossible.

113
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,000
You are a thought man, sheriff Mallick.

114
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,600
You probably know the Lord's words:

115
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,000
Tooth for tooth ...

116
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,000
Yes.

117
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You get up at. 12, to
find the man who did it.

118
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,100
Otherwise, you
with two of your citizens.

119
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,000
Mr. Delarue ...

120
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,100
You choose two, Mayor Keane ...

121
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,400
Otherwise I shoot four.

122
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
Course.

123
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,500
I am ready, Father.

124
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,100
The whole town will forever
be grateful to you.

125
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,000
Promise me that you take
from my grandson.

126
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,000
We must do our best.

127
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,800
I will make sure
the boy learn to operate the store.

128
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
It can not be right.

129
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,100
I am not sure
I can do without you, Grandma.

130
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,500
Of course you can, my boy.

131
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,000
Leave me alone, will not suffice.

132
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,800
I beg you, father.
Help me, Father.

133
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,400
My life is not so paltry.
I will not die!

134
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,000
I've never been a burden to anyone.
I am innocent.

135
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,000
May God have mercy on your wicked soul.

136
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,300
Stay calm, everyone.

137
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,200
Well, Sheriff ...

138
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,300
A tired old woman
and a half man ...

139
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,100
- Was not good enough.

140
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,000
The man's death
are you two's expense.

141
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,300
Tell me, Mayor Keane ...

142
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:44,000
How much will your town
Black Creek, for protection.

143
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,000
80 dollars each month.

144
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,600
I believe in the need for more
protection when there is a murderer in the vicinity.

145
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,500
In the future ...
the amount is doubled.

146
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,300
Mr. Delarue, the soil is not fertile.
We can not make as much money.

147
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,100
$ 160, by the month end.
Every month.

148
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,800
Until this has been
the man who killed my brother.

149
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,200
Do we agree?

150
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,800
Yes.
Yes, we are.

151
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,000
I thought so.

152
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,300
Let him rest in peace, princess.

153
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,200
I find the man who killed Paul.

154
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,400
And I'll make sure he dies.
You have my word on that.

155
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,500
I'll take care of you now.
Together ...

156
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,400
Raul, see.

157
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,000
I'll go and talk to the sheriff.

158
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,700
See you in a bit.

159
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,100
Good day.

160
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Where is your grandmother?

161
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,100
She is dead.

162
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,100
Delarue shot her.

163
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,700
I'm sorry to hear that.

164
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,000
What can I do for you?

165
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,000
I have some skins.

166
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,400
We go west.

167
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,200
So the only two men in the vicinity,
who can shoot, go away.

168
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
Evidently.

169
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,200
Were not you two soldiers
where you came?

170
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,700
We need people like you,
To overcome the killer.

171
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,300
I have been a soldier once,
and it taught me something.

172
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,500
Do not start a fight,
as you know, you lose.

173
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,500
Cowards.

174
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,200
funeral
NATHAN KEANE

175
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,000
Who is it?

176
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Jon.

177
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,300
It's nice to see you in town
for once.

178
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,500
Buyer can still reasons?

179
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
From time to time, yes.

180
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,000
How much will you give?

181
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,200
I can give you no more than 145th

182
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,000
It is lame so much
we did 6 years ago.

183
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,400
As I said,
these are tough times.

184
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:18,000
Since Delerue increased fees,
there are many people who want to sell.

185
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,700
But because you are a good man,
I want to help.

186
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,000
Shall we say 150?

187
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,300
Or you can wait.

188
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,000
Who knows. If they find the man
that killed Delarue's brother -

189
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,400
- Then there would be peace,
and prices will rise.

190
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,800
What man?
Have you not heard?

191
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:46,000
Delarue's brother had just come out
of prison as a madman killed him.

192
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,000
He shot all the coach.

193
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
Since it is so ...

194
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,300
I take the 150th
You will not regret.

195
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,500
You must sign here.

196
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,200
Where are you going?

197
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,500
I will try,
to find a place on the west.

198
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:24,300
I would probably do the same,
If I was a young mayor.

199
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,400
These are for you.

200
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,700
And this is for me.

201
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,000
It is important to save
the money, a good place.

202
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,000
In your boots, maybe?

203
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,500
There are many hungry people out there.

204
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:24,000
14, 15-tails to a total
value of $ 3,148.

205
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:32,800
Plus 12 percent, then your
share $ 3,524.

206
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,100
And 76 cents.

207
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,200
Let's say one dollar.

208
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,800
Madelaine appreciate
the accounts fit.

209
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,200
The devil is in the details ...

210
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,000
The company does not like,
how it looks now.

211
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:06,600
Are you aware that the sheriff in Black Creek,
have telegraphed to the government for help.

212
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,500
I have been blocked
the connection being.

213
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,200
But you can not use
the same methods as in the army.

214
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,400
It's not Indians.

215
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,000
Standard Atlantic, is a modern company
Colonel Delarue.

216
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:26,000
And we use seviliserede methods.

217
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,200
Is that clear?

218
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,500
Good.

219
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,400
When the entire Black Creek bought?

220
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,000
I bought the entire valley in a week
if I do it my way.

221
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,300
Answer my question.

222
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,400
If you can keep the military outside,
so I expect 3-4 months.

223
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,800
It was just what I wanted to know.

224
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,900
Have a nice day.

225
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,200
So they want me to,
to behave seviliseret, princess.

226
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,600
I can certainly good.

227
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,600
As long as we stack of money.

228
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,300
Okay guys.
I will do the rest.

229
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:15,200
Let Peter go.
Mallick?

230
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:21,000
He was not on the stage.
You have nothing on him.

231
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:29,100
He broke the jaw of a deputy sheriff.
He must take his sentence.

232
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:41,500
Unfortunately, it ...
a little different for you.

233
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:46,400
I had to send a message to Delarue,
that we have caught you.

234
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:57,000
You probably know that he has ...
made life difficult for ... us.

235
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,500
I do not know
what has happened to him.

236
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,300
He was once a good man.

237
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,300
To kill all the Indians,
must have ...

238
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,000
- Injured his mind.

239
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,700
I am sorry for your loss, Jon.

240
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I am.

241
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,300
It seems that you
follow in his footsteps.

242
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:33,400
If you blue had shown little mercy,
to Delarue's brother, instead of killing him.

243
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:40,800
So would Mrs. Borowski, sir. Whisler
and Joe legless still be here.

244
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,600
It will not be the last man
Delarue killer around here.

245
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,500
No.
Probably not.

246
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,000
But your dead will win us some time.

247
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,000
I have already
telegraphed for help.

248
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:03,200
So there may be law and order again.

249
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,600
Sometimes you have to sacrifice a sheep,
to save the rest.

250
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,300
I'm just a shepherd.

251
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,800
They say that you have been a soldier.

252
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,600
Have you been to war?

253
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,600
Yes.

254
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,400
Who was the enemy.

255
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,500
The Germans.

256
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,800
The Germans?
Bravo.

257
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,600
You have my respect.

258
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,300
Here he saw.

259
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,000
The sick bastard who beat
your beloved husband to death.

260
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,800
Your beloved husband,
beat my 10-year-old son to death.

261
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,500
And he raped my wife.

262
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,200
You must keep quiet.

263
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:29,100
We'll find out soon enough,
what can he do, soldier.

264
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,000
You're late.

265
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,600
I'll be right with you, Henry.

266
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,100
Can I have his boots?

267
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,300
Here you go.

268
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,400
Keane ...

269
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,600
You will not need, my friend.
Not where you are going.

270
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,400
I have a baptism this morning.

271
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,700
So Sunday Mass
takes a little longer.

272
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:26,200
Give him water if he asks for it.
And you must not think of anything.

273
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,500
Can I have some water?

274
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,600
No.

275
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,000
I'm sorry that I will
back to you.

276
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,400
But the view is better like this.

277
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,800
I had given you a blow,
did not I?

278
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:16,500
You were good enough ugly
before I beat your teeth in ...

279
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,100
But now ...

280
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:23,100
I hope that you have
a woman who loves you.

281
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,400
For you will not find
with that face.

282
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:34,500
You've probably never gotten anything
without paying for it.

283
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,600
Not with your ridiculous voice.

284
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:46,000
But now it comes to cost more.
It certainly is.

285
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,100
Shut up!

286
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,000
I did you a favor actually.
I think it's better now.

287
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,900
Now you sound not just as a sick mule,
Now you look like also.

288
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,100
I said shut up!

289
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,900
Now people are not so surprised
when you say something.

290
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,300
I'll kill you.

291
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,500
It is certainly something
which runs in the family.

292
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:13,000
I am sure that your whore mother
sounded like a mule when you were conceived.

293
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,800
Wow!

294
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:50,000
Do you know how long,
I've been waiting for this moment.

295
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,900
You could feel, right?

296
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,100
Of course you would.

297
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,500
You are so ... beautiful.

298
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:14,500
What these barbarians have done to you ...
Got your tongue.

299
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:20,500
I know it must have been
terrible for you.

300
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:26,000
But I see it ...
as a gift ...

301
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,300
- To me.

302
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
When I'm done here ...

303
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:39,700
- We find a house in New Orleans.

304
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,300
It will suit you.

305
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
You will be New Orleans princess.

306
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Get the horses.

307
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:47,000
Jon! Jon!
I'll be back.

308
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,200
They have taken different roads.

309
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:09,200
Corsican, take half
of men with you on the trail.

310
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,000
The rest come with me.

311
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,500
Third class.

312
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,300
Take your sister inside,
and retrieve father's rifle.

313
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,300
You are not welcome.

314
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:54,400
You should not drink from the well,
it is full of the sticky oil.

315
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,700
I have put something
bread and boiled water.

316
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:21,400
Thank you, Mrs. Whisler.

317
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,200
Why are you leaving?
Delarue killed my husband.

318
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:34,800
I'm sorry I
leave you that way.

319
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,100
Are you with us?

320
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I'll be fine.

321
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:48,000
He'll kill you.

322
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:11,500
Your Paul, he ...
He saved you from the Indians.

323
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,600
But he never tamed you.

324
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:20,900
Damn.

325
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,200
Now I must kill you.

326
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,600
It's a shame, Henry.

327
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,400
We could treat her well.

328
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,500
The body fine.

329
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:45,600
Once more ...
Smiling lady luck to you.

330
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:55,300
After all you've been having fun with her ​​...
So inserts her throat.

331
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,500
I want
my boots back.

332
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:35,500
Your boots?

333
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,200
Course.

334
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:42,600
I saved these for you.

335
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:45,900
I keep them neat and clean.
See.

336
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:47,600
Here.

337
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:51,500
Have you purchased Mrs. Whisler's farm?

338
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:55,000
Yes, I think that I have.

339
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,000
Have you lap?

340
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:01,500
What? I do not understand ...
What about my deed?

341
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,400
Do you want your money?

342
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Clear.
They are here.

343
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
They are here, Jon.
Take them, take them all together.

344
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:17,100
What were you doing at Delarue?

345
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,500
There was one that was dead.

346
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:25,200
Everyone deserves a coffin.
Although they do not go to heaven.

347
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,600
Henry ...
What?

348
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,800
You called him Henry.

349
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,400
Remove the lid of the coffin.

350
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,200
Course.

351
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,300
I am undertaker.

352
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:02,200
That's why I was there.
Somebody has to take care of it.

353
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Lie in it.

354
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,200
I'm just trying to get it
best of it.

355
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,500
That's it.
I'm a businessman.

356
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:21,000
You're not even human.

357
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:24,000
What are you planning?
Lie in it.

358
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:26,400
That you will not get away with.
Lie in it.

359
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:32,100
I am the mayor.

360
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:36,200
I try to help people.

361
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,000
No one will buy their land.

362
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,500
Will not you leave it.

363
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,600
No. God, no.

364
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,300
You're right, Jon.

365
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:58,000
I keep not deeds.

366
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,100
I give them to Delarue.

367
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:25,200
I need a gun with belt
and ammunition for my rifle.

368
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,800
Give me a knife.
I'll pay for it.

369
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,400
Give me also two bottles of kerosene.

370
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,000
You must go
to Mallick, for me.

371
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:02,200
Tell him that Keane has served
money on all of us.

372
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:05,300
All the land and houses he bought ...

373
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:09,200
It was not for himself,
he sold it to Delarue.

374
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,700
It is the oil.

375
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:16,400
Delarue believe that it will soon
is worth a lot.

376
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:19,100
Do you and your brother
fight Delarue alone?

377
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,700
No, my brother is dead.

378
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,400
Let me go with you.

379
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:35,000
You're just a boy.
I am almost 16 years.

380
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,200
I've been practicing.
I am good at shooting.

381
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,700
You do not have a chance alone.

382
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,200
He has taken his own chest with.

383
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:39,400
Burn him.

384
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:28,400
There is a fire in the barn!

385
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,400
Shoot!
Do it now!

386
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:50,500
I have underestimated you, soldier.

387
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:54,400
You may have killed all my people.

388
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,000
But you are definitely ...

389
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:21,000
So you killed him.

390
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:27,000
And all his people.

391
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:39,000
We've been hoping ... and praying.

392
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,200
In order that there should be someone like you.

393
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,500
And save us from our despair.

394
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,700
And so did you.

395
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:53,000
Now there are only good
people back.

396
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:11,100
I thought you had
hit on all of them.

397
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,100
She's with me.

398
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,600
It will not do, Jon.

399
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,400
I would like to have,
that you leave the place.

400
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:44,000
May God forgive both your souls.
