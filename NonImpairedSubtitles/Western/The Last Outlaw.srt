1
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:23,172
..The civil war
..Changed everything.

2
00:00:23,222 --> 00:00:25,758
..Before the battle
..Of bulrun,

3
00:00:25,842 --> 00:00:27,526
..I was a boy.

4
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,562
..Before gettysburg,
..I was a man with hope.

5
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:34,783
..Before appomattox,
..I was a soldier.

6
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,686
..And then came defeat.

7
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:40,689
..So we hit the yankee
..Where it hurt.

8
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,191
..We robbed his banks

9
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:43,776
..And were hunted as outlaws.

10
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,778
..I was still a soldier,

11
00:00:45,862 --> 00:00:48,781
..Fighting for the cause
..That others had surrendered.

12
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,869
..Graff was my colonel,
..And I followed him.

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,954
..He kept us moving forward

14
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,890
..When the pain of
..Looking back was too great.

15
00:01:00,043 --> 00:01:02,795
..Then came that day
..When I first understood

16
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,430
..That graff would stop
..At nothing.

17
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,067
..The whole world had
..Become his enemy,

18
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:11,236
..And we were trapped inside
..Graff's dead soul.

19
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:15,140
..Once I saw that, I knew
..I had to make a choice...

20
00:01:15,225 --> 00:01:18,644
..And that the killing
..And the dying...

21
00:01:18,728 --> 00:01:22,147
..Had just begun.

22
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,296
Hyah!

23
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,287
Otis, get off
there.

24
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,705
Boys, get out of there!

25
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,746
They're here.

26
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,115
I want some men on top,
both sides of the bank.

27
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,119
Quit talking!
Come on!

28
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,259
Run! Tell everyone
I shoot first.

29
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,261
We hit 'em as they get
off their horses.

30
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,547
Keep your heads down!

31
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,247
Deacon, you head up
down the street.

32
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,582
Get your boys
across the road.

33
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,227
Tell me when
everyone's in position.

34
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:40,946
You've got to
do something.

35
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,231
There's money
in that bank.

36
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:45,150
There's people
in there.

37
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,336
They ain't gonna
get into the bank.

38
00:04:47,403 --> 00:04:49,204
We'll hit 'em
as they dismount.

39
00:04:57,613 --> 00:04:59,114
Here they come.

40
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:22,404
One foot in the stirrup,
one in the ground.

41
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,676
Whoa.

42
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:03,345
Ya!

43
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:04,696
Ya!

44
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,456
Please, don't shoot!

45
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,947
Shit.

46
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:23,465
They know we're here.

47
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:32,474
How many posse,
boy?

48
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,043
I don't know nothing
about no posse...

49
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,561
Sir.

50
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,164
Now, what
the hell is this?

51
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:01,336
Tie his skinny bones
to the window.

52
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,673
Come on, move it.

53
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,259
Tie them all to the windows
and make their faces show!

54
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,462
Knock down these beams
and clear this railing.

55
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:16,518
I see some
posse out there!

56
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,304
They gotta come out
the front.

57
00:07:19,388 --> 00:07:21,022
There ain't
no back door.

58
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,397
No good, no good.

59
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,569
Whoa hoo!

60
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:36,171
Good day.
We got it all.

61
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:37,873
Yeah, ha ha!

62
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,824
Hoo hoo!

63
00:07:38,908 --> 00:07:39,991
Dynamite, brother.

64
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,326
Dynamite?

65
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,494
What the hell
are you doing, graff?

66
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:47,749
Take some men.
Get out back now!

67
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,751
Saddle up, boy.

68
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:51,837
You're gonna
burn these people?

69
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:53,972
They didn't
do nothing.

70
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,765
Don't you ever
question me, boy.

71
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,320
Saddle up.

72
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:15,860
He's got dynamite!

73
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,029
Oh, god! Oh, god!

74
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,783
Get on out of here!

75
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:26,338
[people screaming]

76
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,740
#slet us out!

77
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,259
Don't leave us here!

78
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,828
He's got dynamite!

79
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,171
Let's ride!

80
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,390
Ya! Ya! Come on!

81
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,108
Let's ride!

82
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:02,190
Get the tellers!
Get the tellers out of there!

83
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:05,777
Get 'em out of there!
Move it!

84
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:07,212
Ah!

85
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,381
Loomis!
Loomis is hit!

86
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,341
I got you, bastard!

87
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,077
Dynamite!

88
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,411
They're
getting away!

89
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:44,032
Sheriff, you're letting
them get away!

90
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,068
Not for long.

91
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,581
Gotcha.

92
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,171
Come on, now.

93
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,452
Hyah! Come on!

94
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,020
Come on!

95
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,298
Come on, come on!

96
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,151
All right.
The posse's
on our ass.

97
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,786
I can smell 'em.

98
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,521
Inventory.

99
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,890
I got one
went clean through.

100
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,859
Bullet busted
two of my ribs.

101
00:11:00,943 --> 00:11:03,478
I took one in the leg.
Bone ain't broke.

102
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,398
That's what I got
a horse for.

103
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,842
Let me see your leg, boy.

104
00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:19,427
It's just a scratch.

105
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,058
We gonna have to
leave you, soldier?

106
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,728
No. I can ride,
graff.

107
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,564
I can ride.

108
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,282
I'm good.

109
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,535
Ammunition.

110
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,537
I got 11 .36
and 2345.40.

111
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:48,523
1612 gauges,
1845.40's.

112
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,359
9 .45 colts,
2345.70's.

113
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,829
3145.40's,
and my knife.

114
00:11:54,913 --> 00:11:59,467
I got a handful of bullets,
about 30 bullets.

115
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,804
Potts.

116
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:04,973
Count 'em.

117
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:19,270
I got 20 45.40's
and 844.40's.

118
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:21,623
He's two less than 30.

119
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,808
I got 1245.44's.

120
00:12:25,027 --> 00:12:26,161
Eustis?

121
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,946
Give loomis 20 rounds.

122
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,864
Loomis is hit
pretty bad.

123
00:12:29,948 --> 00:12:32,450
Maybe we should
tend to his wounds.

124
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,285
Stop means dying, boys.

125
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,870
We kick back here
for awhile,

126
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:38,089
We can tend
to yours, too.

127
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,593
Tending?

128
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,761
I'll show you tending.

129
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,041
Get up!

130
00:13:33,462 --> 00:13:35,647
Here are them bullets.

131
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:39,150
You ain't gonna
leave me, are you,
eustis?

132
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,269
No, I ain't
gonna leave you.

133
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,688
I can see
you're hurtin'.

134
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,824
Try to get some miles
twixt us and that posse
before I look at your leg.

135
00:13:51,981 --> 00:13:53,948
Don't worry about it.

136
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:55,950
I ain't gonna leave you.

137
00:13:56,018 --> 00:13:58,353
I can do it,
eustis.

138
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,920
If they're not here,
they're not coming.

139
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:18,690
That hound dog's crazy.

140
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,726
You want another
man on it, boys?

141
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,445
There ain't no posse.

142
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,731
I know it, you know it,
we all know it.

143
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,066
Graff says there is,
so there is.

144
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,319
That's a bunch
of puppy shit.

145
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,788
There ain't no sign
of no goddamn posse.

146
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,125
Graff's always
right.

147
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,794
He always
saves our asses,
like in that town.

148
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:42,046
What about back
at that town?

149
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:45,416
He said that bank
would be unguarded.

150
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:48,786
He forced us across
2 1/2 days of rough terrain

151
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:52,223
To this unguarded bank
where we were ambushed.

152
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,559
We ate lead, eustis.

153
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:55,727
He got us out.

154
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,030
He got us in.

155
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:04,953
[whistle]

156
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:07,572
Hey, eustis.

157
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,073
It's just that
we blew the shit

158
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,441
Out of that posse.

159
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,243
There ain't
no damn posse.

160
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,329
What do you savvy,
lovecraft?

161
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,980
I savvy
what I savvy.

162
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:18,449
You boys savvy
what you savvy.

163
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,285
Graff's our leader.
That's all of it.

164
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:24,172
We follow his lead.

00:39:59,847 --> 00:40:03,650
Marshall, these
tracks head downstream.

494
00:40:03,717 --> 00:40:05,218
Follow 'em!

495
00:40:05,286 --> 00:40:06,986
Come on, boys.

496
00:40:13,027 --> 00:40:15,195
Seems ok.

497
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:16,896
Let's go.

498
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:39,035
Hold on, marshall!

499
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,854
They go back
into the river!

500
00:40:44,391 --> 00:40:46,843
Stay back!
They're behind us!

501
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:03,993
(yelling)

502
00:41:19,843 --> 00:41:22,295
All right,
all right,
let's move!

503
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:23,947
It's time
to regroup!

504
00:41:27,334 --> 00:41:28,968
We gotta get
out of here!

505
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:31,638
Eustis, I'll
do one more.

506
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:32,622
Potts!

507
00:41:32,689 --> 00:41:33,522
One more.

508
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,908
Let's go!

509
00:41:37,494 --> 00:41:39,479
Lovecraft,
what's wrong?

510
00:41:39,529 --> 00:41:40,813
Huh?

511
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,002
Nothing.

512
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,559
Give a hand, grubb!

513
00:41:52,626 --> 00:41:54,127
Damn.

514
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,782
They've
got a lot to
answer for.

515
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,587
Mr. Mcclintock?

516
00:42:20,654 --> 00:42:22,905
I reckon we need
to talk to you.

517
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:27,410
Me and the boys.
Well, sir, we quit.

518
00:42:27,494 --> 00:42:29,545
But you can't.

519
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:32,248
No, we can, sir.

520
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:34,450
We're volunteers
and we get the right.

521
00:42:34,535 --> 00:42:35,668
You can't stop us.

522
00:42:35,752 --> 00:42:37,587
But you've shot
none of the outlaws.

523
00:42:37,671 --> 00:42:40,923
You haven't got the money.
It isn't done.

524
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,925
As far as we're
concerned it is.

525
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:45,645
We keep chasing them,
we'll get tired and shot.

526
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,814
Now, the marshall's
been shot.

527
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,399
He's the one
we signed with.

528
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:51,401
Need I remind you men
of the reward

529
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:52,935
That my bank has offered

530
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:56,022
And the $1000 a head bounty?

531
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:59,242
Being that you've failed
to capture anyone but graff

532
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:01,277
And the outlaws
still have the money,

533
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,862
You get not one dime.

534
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:05,481
Not one dime.

535
00:43:05,566 --> 00:43:09,002
Come on, boys,
we're gone.

536
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,453
Trash.

537
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:13,006
Shit.

538
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,091
We're wasting
our time here.

539
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:19,078
Maybe the boys
that stay can

540
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:21,964
Split the shares of
the ones that left.

541
00:43:22,049 --> 00:43:23,099
How's that?

542
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:25,101
What'd he say?

543
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:26,602
Right.

544
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,938
Find out what he said.

545
00:43:28,972 --> 00:43:30,356
Right.

546
00:43:32,393 --> 00:43:35,178
What about the shares
of the boys that
were killed?

547
00:43:35,262 --> 00:43:37,814
You can have that.

548
00:43:37,898 --> 00:43:40,266
That include
the marshall's share?

549
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:44,604
Shit. All right,
goddamn it.

550
00:43:44,654 --> 00:43:46,372
Yes.

551
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:50,827
Well, that
could be a deal.

552
00:43:51,828 --> 00:43:55,298
All right,
say we stay.

553
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:57,867
Who's going to
lead the posse?

554
00:43:57,951 --> 00:43:59,802
You?

555
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,890
May I make
a suggestion,
gentlemen?

556
00:44:20,974 --> 00:44:23,393
Hey, eus,

557
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,529
Seeing as how
you're the leader
and all,

558
00:44:26,613 --> 00:44:28,864
Would you like to
enlighten us as to

559
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,900
The whereabouts
of that saloon?

560
00:44:30,984 --> 00:44:32,385
How about it, eustis?

561
00:44:32,453 --> 00:44:35,555
A shot of whiskey
would be a good
pain killer.

562
00:44:35,622 --> 00:44:37,990
I have powerful
thirst. How about you?

563
00:44:38,058 --> 00:44:39,492
Once we hit
the outpost,

564
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,029
We're 20 miles
from the rio grande
and the border.

565
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:47,133
You think the posse
would be headed there,

566
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:50,203
Whats left of them?

567
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,704
There ain't no posse now.

568
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,239
We blew the shit
out of them.

569
00:44:53,307 --> 00:44:55,908
They're heading back
to that sorry-ass town.

570
00:44:55,976 --> 00:44:57,210
Whooooo!

571
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,746
Whooooo!

572
00:44:59,813 --> 00:45:01,614
Any of you boys
ever been to mexico?

573
00:45:01,682 --> 00:45:02,615
Nope.

574
00:45:02,683 --> 00:45:04,250
You?

575
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:06,986
I haven't,
but I've heard
hellacious stories.

576
00:45:07,054 --> 00:45:08,821
Like what?

577
00:45:08,889 --> 00:45:11,991
Them mexican senoritas,
they got nipples on
their titties

578
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:14,127
About the size of
a confederate silver dollar.

579
00:45:14,194 --> 00:45:15,628
Bullshit!

580
00:45:15,696 --> 00:45:17,263
No way, potts.

581
00:45:17,331 --> 00:45:19,365
I hear they beg for it.

582
00:45:19,433 --> 00:45:20,550
Is that true,
eustis?

583
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:22,218
That might be true.

584
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:24,086
Well, I don't know
about you boys,

585
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,754
But this is my last job.

586
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:29,058
I'm gonna retire
down mexico way.

587
00:45:29,092 --> 00:45:33,896
Use my share to buy me
a nice hacienda by the sea.

588
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:37,400
Get myself a nice
mexican woman on one hand,

589
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,435
A bottle of whiskey
in the other.

590
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,571
Plant my feet in the sand

591
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:44,607
And watch those
long pretty sunsets.

592
00:45:44,691 --> 00:45:47,026
Mexico,

593
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:49,529
Damn.

594
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:51,497
Sounds so good it hurts.

595
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,250
Philo,
they got philo!

596
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:55,568
Blew his face off!

597
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,086
On the ridge!

598
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:59,088
Graff.

599
00:45:59,122 --> 00:46:01,657
Boys, ride!

600
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:02,859
[whistle]

601
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,160
Come on!

602
00:46:04,244 --> 00:46:06,679
Fuck! I knew it!

603
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:08,948
All those men
up on the ridge.

604
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,167
They'll shoot every
single o of us.

605
00:46:11,251 --> 00:46:13,920
We should've shot
that fuckin' kid!

606
00:46:25,065 --> 00:46:27,033
Money in our pockets.

607
00:46:34,274 --> 00:46:36,442
There's your
first $1000.

608
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:38,444
Minus a few cents.

609
00:46:38,512 --> 00:46:40,179
I'm gonna cut me
the trigger finger

610
00:46:40,247 --> 00:46:42,715
Off the notorious
horace philo.

611
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,869
You ain't gonna
touch that boy.

612
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,091
That's one of
my men.

613
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:55,361
You gonna show him
proper respect.

614
00:46:58,765 --> 00:47:01,484
Graff, let's get
back on the job.

615
00:47:11,027 --> 00:47:12,662
You know what
we gotta do?

616
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:14,196
We gotta give them
the money back.

617
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:17,032
Graff don't give a shit
about that goddamn money!

618
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,985
He wants us!

619
00:47:19,035 --> 00:47:22,838
The posse will lay off
if we give them
the money back!

620
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:24,090
Bullshit!

621
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:27,126
Eustis, graff ain't
nothing without
that posse.

622
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:28,711
We gotta give
them the money.

623
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:30,079
Come on.

624
00:47:30,163 --> 00:47:32,665
No, wills, no!

625
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:37,353
I got the money!

626
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:38,588
Oh, shit.

627
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,976
I'm gonna kill
the son-of-a-bitch.

628
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:47,229
Lovecraft, should
we go and give them
some of it?

629
00:47:47,314 --> 00:47:48,648
No!

630
00:47:48,715 --> 00:47:50,466
We're not going
to catch him!

631
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,035
He's got
my goddamn money!

632
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,488
He's heading
straight for
the black gold.

633
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:56,739
The posse's
up there!

634
00:47:56,823 --> 00:47:59,125
I'm gonna shoot
the son-of-a-bitch!

635
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,410
Potts, hold up!

636
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:04,079
Potts, wait!

637
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,616
He'll be that far ahead
when he gets there!

638
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,467
Give it up
potts!

639
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:15,424
There goes all
our goddamn money, eustis.

640
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,426
Shit.

641
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:20,146
[hissing]

642
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:41,067
Hey, graff!
Graff!

643
00:48:41,117 --> 00:48:42,702
Whoa.

644
00:48:42,769 --> 00:48:43,919
Who's that?

645
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,208
It's the money.

646
00:48:49,292 --> 00:48:51,377
Something's wrong here.

647
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:53,295
I don't like it.

648
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,931
He's given back
the money, by god!

649
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:57,800
Looks like
a trick to me.

650
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,935
Yeah, wait on it.

651
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,887
Just wait on it.

652
00:49:01,971 --> 00:49:03,389
Wait here.

653
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:16,035
Careful, boys.

654
00:49:17,604 --> 00:49:20,039
We've been
hit once already.

655
00:49:35,004 --> 00:49:38,457
It's all here.
The money's all here.

656
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:40,226
We can go back now.

657
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,479
You've done
a great job.

658
00:49:47,134 --> 00:49:48,851
Oh, the money!

659
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:55,608
You want
the money, sir?

660
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:05,985
Go get it.

661
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:15,010
Gunfire!

662
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:16,412
Let's go!

663
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:29,725
They hit us again.

664
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:30,776
I don't see 'em.

665
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,778
They got your boy.

666
00:50:34,514 --> 00:50:36,816
That's mcclintock
and the damn money.

667
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:41,287
The money's
history, boys.

668
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:44,406
So are you, outlaw.

669
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,958
Leave off him,
grubb.

670
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:47,910
Need him
to catch them
son-of-a-bitches

671
00:50:47,994 --> 00:50:49,912
To get
the $1000 each.

672
00:50:49,996 --> 00:50:51,630
Fuck 'em.
We blast graff,

673
00:50:51,698 --> 00:50:53,866
With philo,
we got $2000.

674
00:50:53,934 --> 00:50:55,417
I'm with grubb!

675
00:50:55,502 --> 00:50:57,203
Shoot this
son-of-a-bitch

676
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:59,455
And get back
for the reward.

677
00:50:59,539 --> 00:51:00,890
That's right.

678
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:03,091
I say we keep him
alive long enough

679
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,978
To catch them,
then kill him.

680
00:51:06,046 --> 00:51:07,763
What the hell
are you saying?!

681
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,264
Get the whole $8000.

682
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,150
To hell with y'all.
I'm gonna shoot him.

683
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,552
Back up, grubb!

684
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:14,904
Fuck you.

685
00:51:21,728 --> 00:51:23,078
Shit!

686
00:51:32,405 --> 00:51:34,840
That settles that.

687
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,592
Much obliged.

688
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:46,519
Come on, potts!

689
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,571
Pleasure.
Ok, eustis.

690
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:51,590
Oh! Ow, ow, ow,
that hurt!
That hurt!

691
00:51:54,227 --> 00:51:56,729
I saved you.
I saved your asses.

692
00:51:58,481 --> 00:52:00,149
Whoa!
Oh, lucky shot!

693
00:52:00,233 --> 00:52:01,316
Lucky shot!

694
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:05,037
Come on, potts!
Hit him!

695
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:06,956
Stay down, wills.

696
00:52:12,078 --> 00:52:13,712
Come on, potts!

697
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:14,947
All right, potts.

698
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:16,665
That's enough!

699
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:18,467
My goddamn money.

700
00:52:19,953 --> 00:52:21,554
My goddamn money!

701
00:52:21,621 --> 00:52:23,088
Kick him over
here, potts!

702
00:52:23,156 --> 00:52:24,840
Kick him over
here, come on!

703
00:52:24,925 --> 00:52:26,842
Right in the nuts!

704
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,978
You son-of-a...

705
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:30,379
Son-of-a-bitch!

706
00:52:30,463 --> 00:52:32,598
Leave my ass
behind, huh?!

707
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:35,267
Should have
shot the kid, huh?

708
00:52:35,335 --> 00:52:37,102
Should have
shot the kid!

709
00:52:37,186 --> 00:52:38,854
There you go!

710
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:42,024
All right, potts.
You can't kill him.

711
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:44,159
He took
my goddamn money!

712
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:45,978
And maybe
saved our skins.

713
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:47,413
Maybe not.

714
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:54,753
[singing from a distance]

715
00:53:05,799 --> 00:53:08,216
..Graff had a new gang.

716
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:11,220
..And he'd hung us all
..To the end of the earth.

717
00:53:11,304 --> 00:53:13,555
..But I was the one
..He wanted.

718
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,508
..This was a private war.

719
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,695
..And I had to take the chance
..That he and I...

720
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:22,531
..Could find a private truce.

721
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:14,667
My kind of place.

722
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,535
Whiskey, sir.

723
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,007
It's already
paid for, sir.

724
00:54:32,052 --> 00:54:34,470
Inventory,
lieutenant.

725
00:54:34,554 --> 00:54:36,755
Ammo.

726
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:38,807
What is it
you want, graff?

727
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:41,810
Philo had 21 52s.

728
00:54:41,895 --> 00:54:43,562
When I threw
his skinny ass
over a horse,

729
00:54:43,646 --> 00:54:45,197
He had two left.

730
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:46,615
The way
I calculate it,

731
00:54:46,649 --> 00:54:49,484
You're all down
to 35 rounds maximum.

732
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,820
Is that right, graff?

733
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,155
Listen, boy.

734
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:55,824
The posse's got
more than 2,000 rounds.

735
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:58,193
I'm trying to
talk to you, graff.

736
00:55:00,329 --> 00:55:03,365
And I'm trying to
talk to you, too boy.

737
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:05,801
A leader's got to know
how many bullets his men have.

738
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:10,456
You're the leader
now, eustis.

739
00:55:10,506 --> 00:55:13,508
And I want to
make a deal.

740
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,961
You want me to call
the boys off?

741
00:55:16,029 --> 00:55:17,846
What you got
to offer?

742
00:55:17,931 --> 00:55:19,515
I don't know.

743
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:21,233
I don't know
what to offer you.

744
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:22,684
You already got
all the money.

745
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,970
You owe me
more than money.

746
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:27,556
A lot more.

747
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,858
You owe
me evething.

748
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,561
What would it
take, graff?

749
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:37,750
I want you to
give me, give me loomis,

750
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,753
He ain't
no good to you.

751
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:44,372
Son-of-a-bitch
wasn't nothing to begin with.

752
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,241
That might do it.

753
00:55:49,329 --> 00:55:51,430
Or how about potts?

754
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:55,217
That potts will
give you a whole
belly ache of trouble.

755
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,269
You're the leader.

756
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:59,171
Give me wills

757
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,006
Or lovecraft.

758
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:03,275
You can't trust
any one of them.

759
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,527
Goddamn one
of them is
a negro.

760
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:07,012
The other one
is a fool.

761
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:09,398
You know I can't
leave anyone.

762
00:56:09,482 --> 00:56:11,650
Think you could stop
me from takin' out

763
00:56:11,734 --> 00:56:14,787
Any one of them
son-of-a-bitches
anytime I want?

764
00:56:17,023 --> 00:56:20,375
There ain't
no deal you can
do with me, boy.

765
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:21,576
We had a deal.

766
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,212
You were
my lieutenant

767
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:25,164
And you
turned on me.

768
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,718
You shot me,
eustis.

769
00:56:31,754 --> 00:56:34,923
You left me
for dead.

770
00:56:35,008 --> 00:56:37,960
Now's the time
for reckonin'.

771
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:40,512
Here's the deal,
son.

772
00:56:40,596 --> 00:56:42,598
You're the last.

773
00:56:42,682 --> 00:56:44,683
So you make
the best of it.

774
00:57:06,072 --> 00:57:07,689
Shit.

775
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,679
Fuck it.

776
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:23,989
Well, what happened?

777
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:29,278
Where's the bottle?
Where's the whiskey at?

778
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:31,313
Don't ask
me no questions.

779
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:34,116
So long as I lead,
you follow my orders, potts.

780
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:37,536
Where the fuck are you
going to lead us to?

781
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:47,329
I said don't
argue with me, potts.

782
00:57:47,413 --> 00:57:49,915
We got this
posse halfway
up our ass.

783
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:52,167
Got 50 miles of hard ground
in every direction.

784
00:57:52,252 --> 00:57:54,303
Where the fuck are
you going to lead us?

785
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:57,672
To hell and back
if I say so.

786
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:01,326
You got a problem
with that, I'll blow
your fool head off.

787
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,397
Potts.

788
00:58:05,481 --> 00:58:06,514
What?

789
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:09,151
I'm just trying
to save you,
all you boys.

790
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,689
Know what I say?

791
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:18,860
I say, you ain't
fit to lead shit,

792
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,529
Useless.

793
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:24,917
Fuck you.

794
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:52,527
Ah! Fuck you! My leg!

795
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:53,795
Oh, my sore leg!

796
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,230
Fuck, wait!

797
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:57,516
My leg! Stop, stop!

798
00:58:57,566 --> 00:58:59,201
Fuck!

799
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:09,795
Aaahhh!

800
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:32,634
We're going to mexico.

801
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:34,987
Nothing's changed.

802
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:43,662
Like I said,
we're going to mexico.

803
00:59:51,938 --> 00:59:53,772
Want to go
to mexico?

804
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,075
For me?

805
00:59:59,245 --> 01:00:01,463
I don't know.

806
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:04,266
I don't know.

807
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,418
Oh, no, no,, no.

808
01:00:06,486 --> 01:00:08,286
I don't believe
in that voodoo shit.

809
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:10,489
Lovecraft,
get off your ass.

810
01:00:10,556 --> 01:00:11,890
Going to mexico.

811
01:00:11,958 --> 01:00:14,526
Straight there.
Straight there.

812
01:00:40,153 --> 01:00:42,154
Up on the ridge!

813
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:43,705
It's graff!
It's graff!

814
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:45,173
He's up on the hill!

815
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:47,743
Where's loomis?

816
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,494
I don't know.
He was just on
my ass.

817
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:50,979
Eustis!

818
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,082
Whoa, shit!

01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:25,523
Yeah, well I reckon
it ain't over yet either.

987
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:27,925
We got plenty now.

988
01:17:27,993 --> 01:17:30,828
Graff, I guess.

989
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:32,830
Graff?

990
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:34,398
Yeah.

991
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:36,567
Graff?

992
01:17:36,651 --> 01:17:38,969
Ain't you
gonna reload?

993
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:41,038
Yeah.

994
01:17:47,028 --> 01:17:49,497
Reload, lovecraft.

995
01:17:49,531 --> 01:17:51,065
Don't push me,
eustis!

996
01:17:51,149 --> 01:17:52,583
You're the gang
leader, ok?!

997
01:17:52,667 --> 01:17:54,585
That don't mean
you own me!

998
01:17:54,669 --> 01:17:56,203
You hear?

999
01:17:56,254 --> 01:17:58,789
I'll do it
in my own time!

1000
01:17:58,873 --> 01:18:01,742
All right.

1001
01:18:01,827 --> 01:18:03,710
That's right.

1002
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:06,547
It's been a long,
hard ride.

1003
01:18:06,598 --> 01:18:08,349
We've taken some
terrible punishment.

1004
01:18:08,416 --> 01:18:09,934
But we can't
crack now.

1005
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:11,435
We can't lose
our heads.

1006
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,337
We don't know where
graff and that posse is.

1007
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:16,090
They could be
seconds away.

1008
01:18:16,174 --> 01:18:18,392
Reload now.

1009
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:24,899
I--I don't have
to reload.

1010
01:18:24,983 --> 01:18:27,701
I--I got a full one.

1011
01:18:27,769 --> 01:18:29,403
You had two rounds.

1012
01:18:29,454 --> 01:18:31,155
Yeah, but I uh...

1013
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:34,074
I found four--
four rounds
in my pocket.

1014
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:35,709
I just rembered,
is all.

1015
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:37,127
You had two rounds.

1016
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:39,413
This cut jacket,
you know.

1017
01:18:39,464 --> 01:18:41,382
It has too many
damn pockets.

1018
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:51,559
These for me,
lovecraft?

1019
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:54,962
What you talking
about, eustis?

1020
01:18:55,046 --> 01:18:56,430
These bullets.

1021
01:18:56,481 --> 01:18:58,299
These to kill
me with?

1022
01:18:58,383 --> 01:18:59,433
You turned on us.

1023
01:18:59,484 --> 01:19:00,484
You saw graff.

1024
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,086
I uh...

1025
01:19:02,153 --> 01:19:02,970
Lovecraft!

1026
01:19:03,054 --> 01:19:04,805
Go on now,
you turned on us.

1027
01:19:04,890 --> 01:19:06,106
No, I uh...!

1028
01:19:06,157 --> 01:19:08,158
Graff knew I'd be
keeping track ofaff the shells.

1029
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:10,244
That's the way
we always done it.

1030
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:12,663
Don't you see?
He set it up.

1031
01:19:12,747 --> 01:19:14,615
He knew I'd find out.

1032
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:16,000
You turned.

1033
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:17,501
No, I...

1034
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:19,837
That was the lesson.

1035
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:22,990
That one of my men
was gonna turn on me.

1036
01:19:23,074 --> 01:19:25,843
But you?

1037
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:27,494
Damn it, eustis!

1038
01:19:27,579 --> 01:19:30,447
We're all gonna die.

1039
01:19:30,515 --> 01:19:32,433
Graff's gonna
kill us all.

1040
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:33,634
And we can't
stop him.

1041
01:19:33,685 --> 01:19:35,853
He's not human
anymore.

1042
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:38,839
You know!
You killed him
and he came back!

1043
01:19:38,924 --> 01:19:41,809
And he keeps
coming back!

1044
01:19:43,811 --> 01:19:46,447
You made a deal
with graff.

1045
01:19:46,514 --> 01:19:48,949
You saw the way
he killed loomis.

1046
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:52,202
You want to die
like that?

1047
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:56,523
I'm your friend,
eustis.

1048
01:19:56,608 --> 01:19:59,293
There are better
ways to die.

1049
01:20:01,947 --> 01:20:04,198
Go ahead, then.

1050
01:20:04,282 --> 01:20:05,666
Do it.

1051
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:09,420
Do it, lovecraft.

1052
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:11,689
Save your skin.
You can do it.

1053
01:20:11,756 --> 01:20:13,841
Pull the trigger,
lovecraft!

1054
01:20:40,318 --> 01:20:43,320
Graaaaaaaaafffffff!

1055
01:20:55,734 --> 01:20:57,685
Giddyup! Ya ya ya!

1056
01:21:24,612 --> 01:21:26,130
It's four.

1057
01:21:31,903 --> 01:21:33,771
Look.
The rio grande.

1058
01:21:33,838 --> 01:21:35,806
Border of mexico.

1059
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:37,808
Come on,
let's go swimming.

1060
01:21:37,892 --> 01:21:39,677
Haaaa!

1061
01:21:39,744 --> 01:21:41,311
Go on there!
Go on, now!

1062
01:21:41,379 --> 01:21:44,081
Git! Git!

1063
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:45,983
Haaahh haaahh!

1064
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:52,873
Let's go!

1065
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,494
Whoa!
Come on, eustis!

1066
01:21:57,562 --> 01:21:59,580
Ride, ride!

1067
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:01,949
Come on, boy!

1068
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:07,738
Come on, eustis!

1069
01:22:07,806 --> 01:22:08,939
Come on, eustis!

1070
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:11,842
Last one across
the river don't
get no puddin'!

1071
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:14,428
Aaaaa! Goddamn it!

1072
01:22:24,089 --> 01:22:25,355
Mexico, potts!

1073
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,475
Go ahead!
I dropped my hat!

1074
01:22:28,526 --> 01:22:31,695
Gotta cross the border
and get in the river!

1075
01:22:31,763 --> 01:22:34,698
I'm shot!
I'm shot, eustis!

1076
01:22:37,235 --> 01:22:38,986
That's five.

1077
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:42,156
I can't.
He shot me
through the back.

1078
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:44,024
Go, potts!
Cross that river!

1079
01:22:44,092 --> 01:22:45,225
We can make it!

1080
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:46,894
Easy, potts,
we're almost there.

1081
01:22:46,961 --> 01:22:49,229
[coughing]

1082
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:50,964
There it is,
mexico, potts.

1083
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:52,533
Mexico.

1084
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,468
My insides
are comin' out.

1085
01:23:00,675 --> 01:23:03,644
Let's go, potts.
It's right there,
mexico.

1086
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:06,713
That ain't mexico.

1087
01:23:06,781 --> 01:23:09,183
Where are all
the women at?

1088
01:25:58,069 --> 01:25:59,736
Holster your weapon.

1089
01:26:03,274 --> 01:26:05,108
Holster it.

1090
01:27:04,218 --> 01:27:05,919
You couldn't even count

1091
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:07,871
Your goddamn bullets.

1092
01:27:59,974 --> 01:28:01,608
Eustis.

1093
01:28:46,888 --> 01:28:48,972
Inventory.
