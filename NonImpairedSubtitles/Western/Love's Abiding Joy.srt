1
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,184
Maddy, honey, your shirt.

2
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:38,691
-Jeff. That boy can sleep through anything.

3
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:41,784
- Where's my rosy cheeks?
- There's your good girl.

4
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,795
There you go.

5
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,696
- Mommy's in a hurry.
I need you to put your shirt on.
- Matthew.

6
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,098
Thank you.

7
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,103
-Jeff.
- Sorry.

8
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,937
- Cookie had to milk the cow again.
- I lost track of time.

9
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,772
Come here, baby.
Oh, my.

10
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,780
Good girl.

11
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,544
- Morning,Jeff.
- Morning.

12
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,578
Well, it's not rare beefsteaks...

13
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,647
but you should eat
your breakfast anyway,Jeff.

14
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:14,124
- Mornin'.
- Mornin', Scottie.

15
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,165
Well?

16
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:23,066
For what we are about
to receive-

17
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,135
Lord, we are grateful.
Amen.

18
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,506
Amen.

19
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,517
You might as well slow down.
It's not like they can start without you.

20
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,577
It sets a bad example to the students
if the teacher's late.

21
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,150
Cookie, would you, please?

22
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,992
Oh, yeah. Come on here,
you little sweet baby.

23
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,633
- Now, baby.
- You and I need to hurry as well.

24
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,602
- We've gotta move those cows
to that creek on the south side.
- I'm comin'.

25
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,171
- All right now, Maddy.
You listen to Cookie, all right?
- Yes, ma'am.

26
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,973
You mind him. Take a nap when he tells you to.
Stay out of trouble.

27
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:09,481
And all day long, we gonna be
chasin'rabbits and pickin'flowers.

28
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,279
Just havin' a good ol' time.
See your daddy over there?

29
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,980
Missie?

30
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,954
What's the matter?
Did I forget something?

31
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,957
No.

32
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,620
I...just wanted to let you know
to have a nice day.

33
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:25,220
"Have a nice day.''
Well, thank you.

34
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,993
Same to you.

35
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,830
What is it you really
wanted to say, Mr. LaHaye?

36
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,537
I hate that we need the money
from the teaching job.

37
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,905
But between the drought
and the cattle plague...

38
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,809
the herd's much smaller
than it should be.

39
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,508
Well, only the good Lord knows
how big our herd should be.

40
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,051
Let's let our faith rest in him.

41
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:50,556
- You're right.
- I know I am.

42
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,059
I'd better get goin', or Tettsford Junction's
gonna start lookin' for a new teacher.

43
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,118
I love you.

44
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,068
- Have a nice day.
- You too.

45
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,112
Bring 'em up!

46
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:23,485
- Come on,Jeff!.
- Help me up.

47
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,423
Bring 'em up at the back here.!

48
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:30,258
- Move 'em!
- Hyah!

49
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,299
Come on! Move!

50
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,698
- Get on up!
- There they go.

51
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,869
Come on!
Move 'em along!

52
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,318
- Scottie,Jeff!.
- Yeah?
- Yeah?

53
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,725
Drive the herd to the creek.
I'll meet you there.

54
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:06,253
- All right.
- All right.

55
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,963
Whoa.

56
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,514
Afternoon, Mr. LaHaye.

57
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:36,494
Mayor Doros. Abel.

58
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,656
- What brings you out my way?
- Always cut to the chase, don't you?

59
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,529
That usually suits me best, Sam.

60
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,831
That's why we came
to see this man, Abel.

61
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:48,796
Always directly to the point and...
honest to a fault.

62
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,810
I don't think you rode all the way out here
just to pay me a compliment.

63
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,039
It's official business, Willie.

64
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:56,308
We need a sheriff
in Tettsford Junction.

65
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:59,977
If you're here for my official position
on the matter, I'd have to say I agree with you.

66
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:03,544
- I'm here to offer you the job.
- I'm no lawman, Doros.

67
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,183
Hear me out, Willie.

68
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,422
This job doesn't come without
its, uh, share of bonuses.

69
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,660
You get a good, steady paycheck.

70
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,997
- Why me?
- 'Cause people like ya.

71
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:20,061
And you could be persuasive
keepin' the peace, get the job done.

72
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:24,576
I appreciate it, but...
not interested.

73
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:28,671
See, I got my hands full lookin' after my herd
until we take 'em to market.

74
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:31,308
Well, I will be hirin' a sheriff, Willie.

75
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:37,015
And I'd like for that job to go
to a man with integrity, like yourself.

76
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,422
That way,you could help
your family and the town.

77
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,654
Just think about it, Willie.

78
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:01,038
I have a surprise for you today, boys and girls.

79
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:06,073
Someone has donated brand-new readers
for our whole class.

80
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:11,216
- Yes, Annie?
- Are they for our very own to keep?

81
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,281
Everyone will get
their very own copy...

82
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,725
to borrow for the rest of the year.

83
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,786
Would you like to help me
pass them out?

84
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:24,626
There you go.
That's right. Over there.

85
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,940
Now, I'd like for you
to open up your readers...

86
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,638
and write your name
on the inside cover.

87
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:38,810
Use pencil and use
your best penmanship.

88
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,615
- Mrs. LaHaye?
- Yes.

89
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,746
My reader's already
got a name in it.

90
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,950
It's says "Samuel H. Doros."

91
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,188
That's because it was Mayor Doros
who donated these readers.

92
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:52,095
Without his generosity,
we wouldn't have these new books.

93
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,257
All right, class.

94
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,961
I would like to start
with our penmanship.

95
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,300
Now let's begin.

96
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,636
Turn to page three.

97
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,175
Whoa.

98
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,382
Hey, Mandy.!

99
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,658
How much longer?

100
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,724
It should be any minute now.

101
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,635
- Look who's up from her nap.
- Oh.

102
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,835
Miss Kathy never wants to miss the fun.
Isn't that right?

103
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,936
Now I want you two
to be on your best behavior.

104
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:45,382
Just because we live in the Wild West
does not mean that we have to act like it.

105
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,442
I see 'em.! I see 'em!

106
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,454
Oh, he's here!
He's here!

107
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,958
Pa!

108
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,888
Whoa.

109
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,228
Come here, sweetheart.

110
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,666
Oh! Pa! You're here!

111
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,572
Oh, you're finally here!

112
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:14,374
I'm here.
I'm here, sweetheart.

113
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,314
Oh, you're a beautiful sight
for these eyes.

114
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:20,318
I promised your mother...

115
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,377
I would memorize this very moment.

116
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,152
Oh, Pa, I can't tell you
how much I've missed you.

117
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,661
Mama and the boys are fine,
and they wish they were here.

118
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,664
The cost of the trip
was just too much for all of us.

119
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,723
I wish they could've come, too...

120
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,064
but I am so glad that you
didn't wait any longer.

121
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,367
Your mother and I agreed that the timing
was right for me to make the journey.

122
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:43,169
And we know
that God's hand was in it.

123
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:46,268
"Cause suddenly

124
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,813
everything just fell into place.

125
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:52,840
And I'm here...
with you- my baby.

126
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,182
- Oh!
- My angel.

127
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:56,949
I missed you so much.

128
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,457
Oh! Come meet
all your grandchildren...

129
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,857
I've been writing to you about
all these years.

130
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,521
- You are still so beautiful.

131
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:07,088
- Hey, Grandpa. Hey.
- Hey.

132
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,126
This is Maddy.

133
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,036
Stagecoach was rough.

134
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:19,202
- I think I'll walk back, tell you the truth.

135
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,045
- Kathy's down for the night.
- Sounds like she gave up without a fight.

136
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:27,984
Oh, she's worn out from all the excitement
of meeting her grandpa today.

137
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:31,046
Well, it's been
pretty exciting for me too.

138
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,648
Marty and I have been
very grateful...

139
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:37,218
to get to know all of you
from Missie's letters.

140
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:42,962
But it's so nice to finally be able
to put the faces with the names.

141
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,799
All of us bein'apart,
it's been hard.

142
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,362
And I know you've had
some hard times.

143
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,432
But God's with us.

144
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:53,967
It's been a tough couple of years
for all the ranchers in the area.

145
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,037
Little or no rain
made the grazing scarce...

146
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,276
and the cattle plague
swept through the valley.

147
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,683
Thankfully, we have my teaching job
to help make ends meet.

148
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,689
We're just lookin' to hold out...

149
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,851
till we can drive the herd
to market in springtime.

150
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:11,488
Pray for a big payday.
Catch up on things.

151
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,928
I'll pray for that myself.

152
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,993
In the meantime,
I'm just thankful to be here.

153
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,776
How do you always manage to skedaddle
before you're finished getting dressed?

154
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:32,374
- Come here.
- Stir it around.

155
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,318
I might take your pa
and show him the herd this morning.

156
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:38,015
Not before I see
that baby granddaughter of mine.

157
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,752
- Rosy cheeks.
- I'll go get Kathy up.

158
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,817
It's a rare thing
she sleeps in this late.

159
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,456
- Morning.
- Mornin'.

160
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,898
Willie!

161
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,635
- Keep stirring.
- Willie!

162
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,404
Bring it over in here.

163
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:01,344
- What's wrong?
- She's not breathing.

164
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,176
- Kathy?
- Willie.!

165
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,240
- She's not breathing.!
- Kathy?

166
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,444
- Oh, my God!
- Kathy?

167
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,353
-Jeff, get out! Kathy?
- Oh, my God.!

168
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:14,290
- Oh, baby, please!

169
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,324
- What?

170
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:21,423
- What?
- Kathy! Kathy, please!

171
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,163
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, God, no!

172
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:28,695
- No, Kathy. Please.
- Come here, son. Come here.

173
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:31,174
- Kathy.! Come on.!

174
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,235
Come on!
Come on!

175
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,804
- Hold me tight.

176
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:44,618
Grief consumes us.

177
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,284
Emotions betray us.

178
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,352
Somehow, Lord...

179
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,922
let us rest in your promise...

180
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,369
your promise that Kathy
is safe in your arms...

181
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,203
safe in heaven...

182
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,472
where there are no tears, no pain...

183
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,638
no sudden death.

184
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:17,116
Only joy and peace...
and love.

185
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:24,261
Lord, please be with Missie
and Willie and their family.

186
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,393
Walk with them in their grief.

187
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:34,101
Hold them up when they falter.

188
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,573
Sustain them...

189
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,110
when they feel like...
giving up.

190
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,148
- Amen.
- Amen.

191
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,766
Watch your step.

192
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:11,005
- God bless you both.

193
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,858
I-I'm all right, Willie.

194
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:31,794
Really.
I'll be okay on my own.

195
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,717
You take good care of Kathy, Sonny.

196
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,261
Don't let her be scared or nothin'.

197
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,832
She's little, and she could
be awfully lonesome...

198
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,233
thinkin' that she's
missin' out on all the-

199
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,690
I'm Colette Doros.

200
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,658
I'm so sorry
about your little sister.

201
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,899
I'm afraid I don't know what to say.

202
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:49,202
- Me neither.
- I'm sorry.

203
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:00,551
Please accept my condolences, Mr. Davis.

204
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,452
It is such a tragedy.

205
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,490
I am sorry.

206
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,616
Thank you.

207
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,389
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi.

208
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,929
Uh, Mr. Davis,
this is my daughter, Colette.

209
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,126
Colette, this is Mr. Clark Davis-

210
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:20,763
Mrs. LaHaye's father and...
little Kathy's grandfather.

211
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,605
- I'm so sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

212
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:27,543
- It's awful.
- Thank you.

213
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:33,011
Colette is, uh- She's on break.

214
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:36,748
She's been refining her ways
at the Millington Finishing School back East.

215
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,813
Very good.

216
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:45,323
You know how it is with daughters.

217
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,991
They sure can break
their fathers'hearts.

218
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,331
In more ways than one.

219
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,794
The words were just right.

220
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,855
Good.

221
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,561
It's strange...

222
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:26,126
how in an instant
everything can change.

223
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:31,370
Makes a man unsure about...
anything and everything.

224
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:35,174
Mmm. Tough times all over.

225
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:38,478
I gotta say, when you hired me
a few years back...

226
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,747
I was workin' as a hand for ya-

227
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,187
It was a mite easier on the nerves
than having my own spread.

228
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:50,321
Now that I'm married
and Melinda's expectin'...

229
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:54,354
I realize how much is at stake...

230
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,731
how bad I want it to work out.

231
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,634
I put her to sleep just like always.

232
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:36,504
And then I checked on her right before
I went to sleep, and she was fine.

233
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:43,138
Then in the morning, I-
I went to get her up, and she-

234
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,877
she wasn't

235
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,942
She wasn't breathing.

236
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,487
I just want her safe...

237
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,752
and protected.

238
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,532
Missie.

239
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,630
I'll be fine.

240
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,311
I'll be fine.

241
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,861
That was a beautiful service, Henry.

242
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,198
Thank you.

243
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,465
Perhaps...

244
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,501
you should have stuck
to your previous vocation.

245
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,977
Judgin' by those
glorious words you spoke...

246
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:51,675
you know God a lot better
than you know cattle.

247
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,947
- Is she new?
- Gift to my wife from her father.

248
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,390
What a fine gift.

249
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,091
Where's Kathy?

250
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,201
Don't you remember?

251
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:53,210
- We told you. She's with the angels.
- In heaven?

252
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:57,908
- Yes, sweetheart.
- Why?

253
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,676
I don't know.

254
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,764
- Morning.
- Morning, Missie.

255
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,598
- Is Maddy asleep?
- Yes.

256
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,604
What are you doin'?

257
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,267
It's a school day.
I'm getting an early start for once.

258
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:28,105
Jeff, will you get my horse?

259
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:35,409
Missie, it's too soon.

260
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:39,218
Jeff, get my horse.

261
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:49,564
Missie, all right.

262
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,933
I didn't think you'd go back
to teaching quite yet.

263
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:56,371
Look, this is not my choice.

264
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:58,739
We need to work.
We need the money.

265
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:06,079
- Cookie. Will you keep a close eye
on Maddy for me today?
- Yes, ma'am.

266
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:10,417
Will you please move her cradle
and the rest of her things up into the barn?

267
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:13,458
I'll see you later.

268
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:39,006
Ho.

269
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:49,219
So? You're out here all alone?

270
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,890
Uh, I don't mind.

271
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:56,490
Helps me think things through
while I get my work done.

272
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:59,162
Moby Dick?

273
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:01,330
I think it's the best thing
Melville's ever written.

274
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:05,467
Yes. Ishmael and his whaling voyage.

275
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:08,707
As far as authors go,
I prefer Dickens.

276
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,908
I'm halfway through
Great Expectations.

277
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:14,417
"So the evening mists
were rising now...

278
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:18,217
"and in all the bright expanse
of tranquil light they showed to me...

279
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,589
I saw no shadow
of another parting from her."

280
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,356
Those are the last few lines
of the book.

281
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:29,228
I didn't mean to spoil
the ending for you.

282
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,565
You should keep reading though.

283
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,366
You shouldn't run full out
like that.

284
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:41,708
There's wheel ruts
and prairie dog holes.

285
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,045
You shouldn't worry about me.
I'm a very accomplished rider.

286
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:47,778
I was worried about him.

287
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:53,690
How's your father and mother?

288
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,692
Oh, they're-

289
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,627
- They're not my parents.
- They're not?

290
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:01,097
No. The LaHayes adopted me
when I was 1 1 ...

291
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,396
right after my older brother,
Sonny, died.

292
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:07,234
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Uh.

293
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:12,743
This horse- Looks familiar.

294
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:16,303
Mmm. Isn't he beautiful?
My father just bought him for me.

295
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,241
Will you be ready
for an adventure tomorrow?

296
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:24,947
What? Oh.

297
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,287
Yeah, probably.

298
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,350
Good.

299
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,460
See ya.

300
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,029
Mrs. LaHaye.

301
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,835
Mrs. LaHaye.

302
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:54,407
- Oh. What?
- You didn't get my picture.

303
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,470
Oh, I'm sorry.

304
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,539
That's lovely.

305
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:01,244
It's your little girl
going up to heaven.

306
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:02,446
Why?

307
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,722
I'm done teaching.

308
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,634
I tried to do it today,
and I just... couldn't.

309
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,603
We'll be just fine.

310
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:30,368
Well, we might.
We might not.

311
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,672
I just know I can't go back.

312
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,875
Who is it, Abel?

313
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,820
It's LaHaye.

314
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,860
Willie.

315
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,897
I came about the sheriff position,
if the offer's still on the table.

316
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,525
Offer still stands.

317
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,297
Come on in.
Talk about the particulars.

318
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,812
"And Samson called
unto the Lord and said...

319
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,578
"O Lord God, remember me...

320
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:50,212
"I pray thee, and strengthen me.

321
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,587
- I pray thee, only this once, O God."

322
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:55,649
Pa!

323
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,195
Mmm! Hey, little man.

324
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,002
Pa, you're squeezin' me.

325
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:04,991
Pa, you're squeezin' me.

326
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,778
Cookie left some supper
on the stove for you.

327
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:27,285
Mayor Doros offered me a job today.

328
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,958
- What kind of job?
- They're needin' a sheriff.

329
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,725
- We didn't discuss it.
- Well, we need the money.

330
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:37,029
- Keep the ranch goin!
- Who's gonna run the ranch?

331
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,433
Scottie.

332
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:54,708
Missie, your finger's bleeding.

333
00:30:57,588 --> 00:30:59,579
I didn't feel a thing.

334
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,900
William LaHaye, as sheriff
ofTettsford Junction...

335
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:21,570
your duties
will be wide and varied:

336
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:24,171
not limited to, but including,
keeping the peace...

337
00:31:24,248 --> 00:31:28,014
executing court orders
and warrants...

338
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,919
seizure of debtors' property
when liens are due...

339
00:31:30,988 --> 00:31:34,287
serving papers and posting notices
when called for.

340
00:31:34,358 --> 00:31:35,950
Do you promise on your honor...

341
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:39,463
as your word is your bond
and the Bible is your conscience...

342
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,431
- to uphold these duties?
- I do.

343
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,527
As mayor ofTettsford Junction,
I declare you duly sworn in.

344
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:02,852
Congratulations, Sheriff LaHaye.

345
00:32:04,288 --> 00:32:07,052
- Hi.

346
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:10,652
- Hello.

347
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:13,162
You look like someone
who could use a little adventure.

348
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:16,325
- Do I?
- Come on. Come with me.

349
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,029
- I- I can't. I've got a job to finish here.
- Do it later.

350
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,732
A man just doesn't up and quit
in the middle of a job.

351
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:26,573
A man is the master ofhis own day,
his own hours.

352
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:31,081
Makes up his own mind.
Come on.

353
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:37,944
Come on.

354
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,242
Cookie.

355
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,710
You got some grub
I could take out to Scottie and Jeff?

356
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,770
I'm workin' on it as we speak.

357
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:06,214
- Maddy down for his nap?
- Yes, sir.

358
00:33:08,085 --> 00:33:10,076
How's she doin'?

359
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:16,924
Well, sir, she won't eat...

360
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:19,554
and she won't come out of that room.

361
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:23,396
- It's like she just-
- It's like she just stopped.

362
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:26,231
It's like she just stopped.

363
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:28,602
Why don't we try to give her
some of your soup?

364
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,972
- It smells so good.
- Oh, yes.

365
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,508
Missie?

366
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:53,086
I've been praying...

367
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:57,127
for God to give you comfort.

368
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:03,337
- I brought something for you to eat.
- I can't.

369
00:34:03,407 --> 00:34:08,401
Please. You gotta try,
even if you don't feel hungry.

370
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:11,812
Please, Pa,just leave me alone.

371
00:34:11,882 --> 00:34:14,214
I can't do that, darlin'.

372
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:16,810
I love you too much.

373
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,974
Hi, Roy.

374
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:40,306
- Doros!

375
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:43,279
- Doros.! Get out here!

376
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:47,010
- Doros, you coward! Get out here!

377
00:34:47,084 --> 00:34:49,018
Are you gonna run and hide...

378
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,650
or face me like a man, Doros?

379
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:58,525
You can't hide behind your money now,
can ya, huh?

380
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,292
Joe Paxson?
Is that you?

381
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:04,732
It's me. Who's that?

382
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:09,535
It's Willie LaHaye.
I'm the new sheriff.

383
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,474
Do some sheriffin'
and lock up that crook Doros.

384
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:15,068
Why don't you put the gun down?
We'll talk about that.

385
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:18,809
Talkin' don't save a man's land.
Bullets are the ticket!

386
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:22,011
Come on,Joe.
I got some coffee in my office.

387
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:24,247
And we can straighten this out...

388
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,313
get to the bottom
what's troublin' you.

389
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,917
- Doros is at the bottom of it.

390
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:32,929
Samuel
"Sell Me Down the River" Doros!

391
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:35,864
Listen,Joe.Joe.

392
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:40,032
You don't wanna give your-
your plan away like this.

393
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:41,935
He took my family.

394
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:53,043
Hey. You gonna help me, LaHaye?

395
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,277
Yeah. I'm gonna help you inside...

396
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:00,518
to some coffee and a good long nap.

397
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:07,095
It's all right.

398
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:09,962
You got one bad man
left in town, Willie.

399
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:12,025
Soup's gettin' cold.

400
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,734
- Stubborn.
- Yep.

401
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,592
Must be hundreds.

402
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:16,155
My mother had them shipped over
from her home in Boston.

403
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:18,997
Father always said
she lived and breathed books.

404
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:21,128
"The Complete Works
of William Shakespeare."

405
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:24,606
-Have you read much Shakespeare?
-Missie had me read Romeo and Juliet.

406
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:27,473
- It's so romantic, isn't it?
- Well, I read it a few years ago.

407
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:31,276
And at the time, I was more interested
in the poison and the dagger.

408
00:37:31,348 --> 00:37:34,249
Well, perhaps if you read it now...

409
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:38,982
-you would be more interested in romance.
- Maybe so.

410
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:41,547
If you read it now,
you would see that...

411
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:45,117
though they're young,
they both knew their own hearts.

412
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,959
They knew that theirs was true love.

413
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:50,125
You can borrow it if you'd like.

414
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,192
- Really?
- I don't see why not.

415
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:54,203
I mean, I'm gonna
see you again, aren't I?

416
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:57,434
I'm afraid that some of those
are too fragile to be let out.

417
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:06,016
Jeff and I were out riding,
and I wanted to show him the library.

418
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:09,883
It's- It's like nothin'
I've ever seen.

419
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:13,754
Well, as you can see, this is also my office.
I have work to attend to.

420
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:16,486
Father, there are just a few more titles
I'd like to show Jeff.

421
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,256
I'm afraid it's gonna
have to wait, Colette.

422
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,264
- But, Father-
- It's fine.

423
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,824
Your father's a busy man.

424
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:29,496
- Good-bye, sir.
- Good-bye.

425
00:38:39,149 --> 00:38:42,983
I am so sorry about that.
My father's not usually so rude.

426
00:38:43,053 --> 00:38:44,987
Don't worry about it.

427
00:38:45,055 --> 00:38:49,116
- I'll bring you the book next time I see you, okay?
- No. Better not.

428
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:51,184
It might upset your father.

429
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:55,565
I have been upsetting my father...

430
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:58,796
since I was old enough to tell him
what dress I wanted to wear.

431
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,436
You sound like a girl
who likes to be contrary.

432
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,701
I'm a woman
who knows what she wants.

433
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:09,135
And what would that be?

434
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:12,740
I'd like to spend
more time with you.

435
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,843
Uh, unless you don't want to.

436
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:19,890
I- I'm sorry if I'm coming off
like a spoiled brat.

437
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:21,754
- I-
- No.

438
00:39:21,825 --> 00:39:23,759
No, I'd like that.

439
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:28,764
Colette.

440
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,735
Please, sweetheart, come on in.
Have a seat.

441
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:49,351
So, are you in the habit of, uh,
spending your time with strange young men?

442
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,581
He's hardly a strange
young man, Father.

443
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:53,646
I met him with you
at the LaHayes' ranch.

444
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:58,826
You been spending time
with him ever since?

445
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,421
I've seen him a couple of times.

446
00:40:01,498 --> 00:40:03,466
Is being at home so tedious...

447
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:06,162
to where you have to spend your time
with the likes of him?

448
00:40:06,236 --> 00:40:08,227
You just have to give him a chance.

449
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:11,035
He knows books
and ranching and horses.

450
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,042
You'll like him
once you get to know him.

451
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,738
That's hardly somethin'
that's likely to happen, baby.

452
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,804
'Cause you'll be goin'
back to school...

453
00:40:17,881 --> 00:40:20,543
and he'll be goin' back to doin'
whatever it is that he does.

454
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,533
You're home late.

455
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,807
I didn't mean to wake you.

456
00:41:50,874 --> 00:41:52,808
You didn't.

457
00:41:52,876 --> 00:41:54,867
I'm just lying here thinking.

458
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:08,891
Willie.

459
00:42:10,627 --> 00:42:14,256
Have you been able to cry
ever since Kath's-

460
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,334
No.

461
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:43,426
Come on in, Sheriff.
Mr. Doros been expecting you.

462
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,168
- Boys.

463
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:58,140
Sheriff LaHaye.

464
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:02,008
Hope you brought your appetite.
Pull up a seat.

465
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:08,680
All right. Thanks.

466
00:43:11,955 --> 00:43:13,889
-Juanita.
- Sí?

467
00:43:13,957 --> 00:43:16,482
- Más vino, por favor.
- Sí, señor.

468
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,758
I may have some pressing issues that, uh,
will need your attention shortly.

469
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:25,998
Seems that Henry and Melinda Klein
have me between a, uh

470
00:43:26,069 --> 00:43:28,060
Shall we say a rock
and a hard place?

471
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:30,038
Henry and Melinda
are good friends of mine.

472
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,098
I'm sure they're good people.

473
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:36,477
But they gotta pay their debts
just like everybody else.

474
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:39,015
Had a bad spell last year.

475
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:47,188
See, Klein borrowed
a lot of money from me...

476
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:50,192
using his land and his livestock
as collateral.

477
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,421
They've missed several payments.

478
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,726
- How much does he owe?
- Enough.

479
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:58,700
He needs to pay me, or you need
to remove him from the premises.

480
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,236
LikeJoe Paxson?

481
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,364
I know about that ruckus
with him in town.

482
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,431
Drunken fool.

483
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:08,069
The man lost everything.

484
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,911
Even had to send his wife and daughter away
'cause he couldn't provide for 'em.

485
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,780
You know, when I was a boy...

486
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:18,310
I could remember goin' for days
without anything in my stomach.

487
00:44:18,388 --> 00:44:20,379
And when I did have a meal...

488
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:22,448
hell, I couldn't even enjoy it...

489
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:25,859
because I was too busy worrying about
where my next meal would come from.

490
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:29,729
All because I had a father
that was weak.

491
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,859
He'd built everything up...

492
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:34,631
only to let someone
come in and take it from him.

493
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,969
I'm not my father, LaHaye.

494
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,907
You're sitting in the biggest house
for a hundred miles.

495
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:43,140
You know, the gap between me...

496
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:46,239
and the chance of poverty
will never be big enough to suit me.

497
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:50,810
And if that means tossing people
like Paxson off his land, then so be it.

498
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:53,220
And I refuse...

499
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,884
to let life take
a sucker punch at me.

500
00:44:57,461 --> 00:45:00,726
See, we all make choices, LaHaye.

501
00:45:00,797 --> 00:45:02,992
You know, take you, for instance.

502
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:06,092
You made the choice
to become sheriff...

503
00:45:06,169 --> 00:45:08,694
keep food on your table
for your family.

504
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:11,297
Now, Paxson...

505
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,775
he chose to raise cattle...

506
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:16,005
which ended up
on another man's table.

507
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,173
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

508
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:21,615
When you get back to the jail...

509
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:23,710
you can thankJoe Paxson
for that steak.

510
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:25,778
Lunch was on him.

511
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:33,552
Gotta get back to town.

512
00:45:38,234 --> 00:45:40,429
Oh, Sheriff.

513
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:45,333
Aren't you forgettin' something?

514
00:45:54,117 --> 00:45:56,051
Now, those papers-

515
00:45:56,119 --> 00:46:01,250
They give me the legal rights to claim
Henry Klein's property if he should default.

516
00:46:01,324 --> 00:46:04,054
If he's got the money to pay me,
well, that's fine.

517
00:46:04,127 --> 00:46:08,063
If not, then you do yourjob,
Sheriff...

518
00:46:08,131 --> 00:46:10,122
and you give him notice.

519
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,796
Seven days,
and they vacate the premises...

520
00:46:14,871 --> 00:46:18,671
leaving all their possessions-
including livestock- behind.

521
00:46:21,544 --> 00:46:23,478
Well, you tell Doros...

522
00:46:23,546 --> 00:46:25,639
I'll pay him
when I drive the cows to market.

523
00:46:25,715 --> 00:46:28,741
That's still a month away.

524
00:46:28,818 --> 00:46:32,720
Listen. The loan contract says
you gotta pay him something now.

525
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:35,417
You need to make
at least one payment.

526
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:37,483
Maybe something you could sell.

527
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,154
I sold everything
that's not tied down.

528
00:46:41,931 --> 00:46:44,491
And, you know, Melinda's expecting.

529
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:57,912
Why didn't you tell me
things were so bad for you?

530
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:04,186
I guess I was praying for a miracle.

531
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:06,586
Doros will force this issue, Henry.

532
00:47:06,656 --> 00:47:10,683
- He'll take your land.
- Over my cold, dead body.

533
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,093
That kind of talk
won't do your family any good.

534
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:18,362
The law says you've got seven days,
or else I have to remove you from your property.

535
00:47:44,794 --> 00:47:46,785
- Hi, Pa.
- Mornin'.

536
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:50,332
You're up and out early.

537
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:56,838
I tell ya. Scottie-
He sure is one tough old man.

538
00:47:56,906 --> 00:48:02,037
He's keepin'me busier than a farmer
with a broke plow and a lame horse.

539
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:12,020
You all right?

540
00:48:12,088 --> 00:48:14,181
Trying to be, Pa.

541
00:48:15,925 --> 00:48:21,261
Most times I just feel like there's
a dark cloud hanging over us...

542
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:23,322
I can't get out from under.

543
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:28,133
Just nagging doubts and...

544
00:48:28,204 --> 00:48:30,263
shaken faith.

545
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,535
I feel like-

546
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:34,804
like Willie and I are pulling apart.

547
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:37,346
Losing a child-

548
00:48:37,413 --> 00:48:40,314
That's the hardest pain
any parent can go through.

549
00:48:42,652 --> 00:48:44,813
You just have to make sure...

550
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:49,018
that you don't let that dark cloud
overstay its welcome...

551
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,687
steal your joy, make you bitter.

552
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:58,500
It'll whisper lies
disguised as truth.

553
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:02,163
It will attempt to divide you...

554
00:49:02,238 --> 00:49:04,638
from those that you love.

555
00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:09,339
You know that you and Willie...

556
00:49:09,412 --> 00:49:13,178
are both welcome back home
if you decide not to stay.

557
00:49:13,249 --> 00:49:16,548
We will do everything in our power
to make sure you get a fresh start.

558
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:19,087
- Thank you, Pa.
- Hey.

559
00:49:19,155 --> 00:49:22,989
You two have been working so hard
to make sure everything else gets done.

560
00:49:23,059 --> 00:49:25,050
I guess that's it.

561
00:49:26,329 --> 00:49:28,320
Well, you know where he is.

562
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:30,059
What do you mean?

563
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:34,297
I'm saying it might be high time
that you went to visit your husband.

564
00:49:38,808 --> 00:49:40,776
The sheriff.

565
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:44,905
Now,you go freshen up,
and I'll saddle your horse. Okay, darling?

566
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:16,937
I can't stop, Colette.

567
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:25,110
How can I help?

568
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:34,258
Want to hand me
that hammer and a nail?

569
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:07,853
Well, you were right.

570
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:10,365
Colette and the LaHaye boy
been getting pretty cozy.

571
00:51:10,433 --> 00:51:12,663
They're together right now.

572
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,597
He's gonna regret that.

573
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:41,320
Oh.

574
00:51:41,397 --> 00:51:43,388
- Hey.
- I hope I'm not intruding.

575
00:51:43,466 --> 00:51:46,731
- If this is a bad time to visit, I can come back.
- No. No.

576
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:48,794
It's really nice to see you, Melinda.

577
00:51:48,871 --> 00:51:50,862
Please come in.

578
00:51:57,613 --> 00:51:59,945
I'm sorry I haven't
stopped by until now.

579
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:03,213
- I've been an awful friend.
- Oh, no.

580
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,550
No. Please don't say that.

581
00:52:05,621 --> 00:52:09,216
To be honest, I don't think I could have
dealt with the company before.

582
00:52:13,496 --> 00:52:17,159
How are you and Henry...
and the baby?

583
00:52:17,233 --> 00:52:20,930
Fine. Except for,
you know, the ranch, but-

584
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:24,599
- The ranch?
- Willie hasn't told you?

585
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:28,770
I don't really see Willie
that much nowadays.

586
00:52:30,646 --> 00:52:33,774
Not since he's been working as sheriff.
Did you know that?

587
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:36,785
Mmm. He came by the other day.

588
00:52:40,923 --> 00:52:42,618
What happened, Melinda?

589
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:53,266
Henry owes Sam Doros some money...

590
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,861
and he sent Willie
to come by to collect.

591
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,873
I'm sorry.
Really sorry, Melinda.

592
00:53:00,943 --> 00:53:03,503
Last year, after the drought, um...

593
00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:05,604
Doros paid Henry a visit...

594
00:53:05,681 --> 00:53:07,706
and he made it seem like...

595
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:10,378
he wanted to help Henry
get back on track.

596
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:13,149
And like everybody,
we were hurting financially, so...

597
00:53:13,222 --> 00:53:15,315
we took him up on his offer.

598
00:53:17,593 --> 00:53:19,652
And now we're behind
on our payments.

599
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:22,391
And, uh-

600
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:27,164
And since Willie is sheriff, he's the one
who has to force us from our land.

601
00:53:27,236 --> 00:53:30,672
- Willie won't do that.
- The sheriff doesn't have a choice.

602
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:40,045
What happens to Henry and Melinda
if they don't pay Doros on time?

603
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:44,951
Doros will foreclose on their ranch just like
he done toJoe Paxson and probably others.

604
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:48,320
I know this is awful for you.

605
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:54,528
I've been thinking
about going back to teaching.

606
00:53:54,597 --> 00:53:56,588
- Oh.
- If I go back...

607
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:59,191
then you wouldn't have to do this
and be in this situation.

608
00:53:59,268 --> 00:54:02,101
- You can't go back to teaching, Missie.
- Yes, I can. I can reopen-

609
00:54:02,171 --> 00:54:05,299
No. No. Not now. Please.

610
00:54:05,374 --> 00:54:08,434
Why? I don't understand.

611
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:11,173
I can't explain it.

612
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:13,306
I just need to know
you're here, safe.

613
00:54:18,721 --> 00:54:21,383
I'll stay, Willie.
I'll stay.

614
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:26,118
Have you been praying for his help?

615
00:54:29,031 --> 00:54:31,022
I can't seem to.

616
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,534
Maybe we should try
praying together.

617
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,572
What exactly would we
be praying for, Missie?

618
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:38,573
The only thing we both want...

619
00:54:38,641 --> 00:54:41,508
we won't ever see again.

620
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:23,477
Don't let this be happening.

621
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:28,687
Oh, God, please.

622
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:30,783
Don't let this be happening.

623
00:56:40,229 --> 00:56:42,288
Hey, Mandy.!

624
00:56:45,534 --> 00:56:50,164
As you can see, Mr. Taylorson, everything
I brought with me is of the finest quality.

625
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:53,936
I'm sorry, Mrs. LaHaye,
but $1 3 is all I can do.

626
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:59,448
That still leaves me two dollars short
of what I need.

627
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:04,042
Well, that's entirely up to you.

628
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:21,232
But if it's worth
two dollars to you-

629
00:57:27,276 --> 00:57:29,574
Watch your backs out there.

630
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:18,553
- What?

631
00:58:18,627 --> 00:58:20,618
Okay. Wait.

632
00:58:33,709 --> 00:58:36,234
Jeff? Jeff.

633
00:58:39,982 --> 00:58:41,973
Jeff.

634
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,680
Jeff.

635
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:48,747
Jeff.

636
00:58:48,824 --> 00:58:50,917
Jeff, what are you doing?

637
00:58:50,993 --> 00:58:54,156
- I need to talk to you.
- How about a moonlight stroll?

638
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:56,460
I was hoping you'd say that.

639
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:34,029
I'm glad you could make it, Sheriff.

640
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:38,673
We both think
we're standing on our own land.

641
00:59:41,877 --> 00:59:45,677
Henry, you knew this day was comin'.
You should have packed something...

642
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,046
gotten your goods together
so he couldn't have 'em.

643
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:50,347
I'm not goin' anywhere.

644
00:59:50,419 --> 00:59:52,683
Come on.
Is this gonna take all day?

645
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:56,191
- Please.
- I know you're just doing your job, Willie.

646
00:59:56,258 --> 00:59:59,159
Seems that me and Klein
have come to an impasse.

647
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:04,932
Abel.

648
01:00:11,204 --> 01:00:13,331
You're too full of yourself
to realize...

649
01:00:13,407 --> 01:00:16,069
that the user you are
is indeed being used.

650
01:00:16,143 --> 01:00:19,374
To the grave you'll be dragged
by the seducer of your greed.

651
01:00:19,446 --> 01:00:22,040
And when you're an old man...

652
01:00:22,115 --> 01:00:25,312
you'll live off the memory of your usury
and your escapades...

653
01:00:25,385 --> 01:00:27,512
too full of pride to admit...

654
01:00:27,587 --> 01:00:30,852
you're nothin' but an empty shell.

655
01:00:32,693 --> 01:00:36,185
I know men like you,
despising reproof.

656
01:00:36,263 --> 01:00:39,232
Not that you were made that way.

657
01:00:39,299 --> 01:00:41,699
But you rejected
what you were made for.

658
01:00:41,768 --> 01:00:44,328
Here, Doros.

659
01:00:46,273 --> 01:00:48,935
Here's enough
to keep us on our land.

660
01:00:49,009 --> 01:00:51,170
Gives you another 30 days.

661
01:00:53,814 --> 01:00:57,181
Oh, and by the way...

662
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:59,878
I used to be a good pastor.

663
01:00:59,953 --> 01:01:01,921
But now I'm a rancher.

664
01:01:01,989 --> 01:01:04,014
So why don't you get off my land?

665
01:01:05,459 --> 01:01:08,019
Thirty days.

666
01:01:08,095 --> 01:01:10,859
Ladies.

667
01:01:10,931 --> 01:01:13,559
Abel.

668
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:35,154
Are you all right?

669
01:01:35,222 --> 01:01:38,555
- I would have had to do it, Missie.
- I know.

670
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,889
Will you ride home with me?

671
01:01:42,963 --> 01:01:44,897
I gotta get back to town.

672
01:02:15,996 --> 01:02:18,692
Colette? Is that you?

673
01:02:23,603 --> 01:02:26,538
- Hello, Father.
- Hey. Where you been?

674
01:02:26,606 --> 01:02:28,870
-Just out riding.
- By yourself?

675
01:02:28,942 --> 01:02:33,174
I'm gonna be surrounded by girls at school
in a few days, so I don't mind the solitude.

676
01:02:33,246 --> 01:02:36,215
- I see.
- Well, if that's all, I'm gonna go change.

677
01:02:36,283 --> 01:02:39,047
Well, there is one more thing.

678
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:41,314
It's a matter of conscience.

679
01:02:44,124 --> 01:02:47,491
I had a change of heart
about that, uh, new horse I got you.

680
01:02:47,561 --> 01:02:51,224
- You mean the one you took from the Kleins?
- Yeah. It's been, uh-

681
01:02:53,533 --> 01:02:55,694
been on my mind
for the last couple of days.

682
01:02:55,769 --> 01:02:58,795
I think the only right thing to do
is to give it back.

683
01:02:58,872 --> 01:03:00,737
Father, that's wonderful.

684
01:03:00,807 --> 01:03:04,368
Just find myself in a bit of a bind
as exactly how to do that.

685
01:03:04,444 --> 01:03:06,002
Just give it back.

686
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:10,175
I am a businessman,
and I have a reputation, Colette.

687
01:03:11,318 --> 01:03:13,309
Can't appear soft or indecisive.

688
01:03:13,386 --> 01:03:16,480
I think the best way
to handle this situation is that...

689
01:03:16,556 --> 01:03:20,925
if you were to give the horse
to that friend of yours,Jeff LaHaye, and...

690
01:03:20,994 --> 01:03:24,361
well, have him return it
to the Kleins.

691
01:03:25,298 --> 01:03:27,994
One more thing.

692
01:03:28,068 --> 01:03:30,400
I'd rather nobody knew
it was my idea.

693
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:32,995
I won't tell.

694
01:03:33,073 --> 01:03:35,200
Thank you, Father.
You're doing the right thing.

695
01:03:39,579 --> 01:03:41,877
I know I am.

696
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:25,074
Missie.

697
01:05:31,091 --> 01:05:33,423
Missie. Missie.

698
01:05:34,794 --> 01:05:37,957
Come on out of the rain now.
You're gonna get pneumonia.

699
01:05:38,898 --> 01:05:40,991
Come on now.

700
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:46,501
Come on inside.
Let's go.

701
01:05:46,573 --> 01:05:48,564
Pa, no.

702
01:05:48,642 --> 01:05:50,872
- Come on. Come on now.
- Pa, no. Le- Let me go.

703
01:05:50,944 --> 01:05:53,845
Come on. You gotta go inside.
What's this about?

704
01:05:53,913 --> 01:05:56,006
Please let me go.
I can feel it!

705
01:05:56,082 --> 01:05:59,245
It's the rain! It's the drops!
I can feel it for the first time!

706
01:06:14,901 --> 01:06:18,667
Why her?

707
01:06:18,738 --> 01:06:20,729
I just don't understand.

708
01:06:20,807 --> 01:06:23,105
Well, we're not always meant to.

709
01:06:23,176 --> 01:06:27,613
You didn't even get to know her.
She was as sweet as an angel.

710
01:06:27,681 --> 01:06:31,947
- I know.
- I just don't know what I'm doing anymore.

711
01:06:38,191 --> 01:06:40,853
You're doin' it, little one.

712
01:06:42,162 --> 01:06:44,960
- No, please.
- You're doin' it.

713
01:07:00,547 --> 01:07:03,107
Whoa.

714
01:07:04,984 --> 01:07:07,646
Frank. That china come in?

715
01:07:10,156 --> 01:07:12,124
- Oh! Uh-
- Missie.

716
01:07:12,192 --> 01:07:16,094
- I didn't know you were comin' in to town today.

717
01:07:16,162 --> 01:07:19,359
I'm a little surprised myself.

718
01:07:19,432 --> 01:07:21,457
Is it all right?

719
01:07:22,669 --> 01:07:25,263
Um, yeah.
It's- It's fine.

720
01:07:37,283 --> 01:07:39,274
Looks good.

721
01:07:39,352 --> 01:07:41,582
It's just leftover ham.

722
01:07:41,654 --> 01:07:43,952
- We-
- How's Maddy?

723
01:07:44,023 --> 01:07:46,617
Keepin' Cookie on his toes.

724
01:07:46,693 --> 01:07:48,422
That's good.

725
01:08:25,098 --> 01:08:29,626
Lord, for the time
that we had her...

726
01:08:29,702 --> 01:08:31,693
we thank you.

727
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:36,509
For all the days of our lives
that we will miss her...

728
01:08:37,944 --> 01:08:42,142
we ask that your love
helps ease the ache in our hearts.

729
01:08:45,385 --> 01:08:47,478
Amen.

730
01:08:47,554 --> 01:08:49,545
Amen.

731
01:09:57,957 --> 01:09:59,948
-Jeff.
- Whoa.

732
01:10:01,427 --> 01:10:03,418
I'm so glad you came.

733
01:10:05,765 --> 01:10:07,756
You knew I'd come to say good-bye.

734
01:10:07,834 --> 01:10:11,463
- It's only good-bye for a little while.
- I'm gonna miss you.

735
01:10:11,538 --> 01:10:13,972
I'll miss you too.

736
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:17,441
- Oh, I brought you something.
- Oh, but I don't-

737
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:20,968
It's two things, actually, but they're
not gifts in the traditional sense...

738
01:10:21,047 --> 01:10:23,038
because you can't keep them.

739
01:10:23,116 --> 01:10:25,050
Here.

740
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:30,018
- Oh, Colette, I can't take this.
- Please take it.

741
01:10:30,089 --> 01:10:33,081
Read Romeo and Juliet again.
For me.

742
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:34,751
Thank you.

743
01:10:34,827 --> 01:10:37,523
Oh. Here.

744
01:10:43,069 --> 01:10:45,594
Here.

745
01:10:45,672 --> 01:10:49,301
I want you to take my horse
and give it back to Mrs. Klein.

746
01:10:51,611 --> 01:10:55,980
- But, Colette, your father-
- My father gave me this horse.
Now I want to give it back.

747
01:11:00,186 --> 01:11:02,177
I should go.

748
01:11:17,136 --> 01:11:19,502
Oh. I- I'll give you a leg up.

749
01:11:41,294 --> 01:11:43,285
Okay.

750
01:11:47,467 --> 01:11:49,492
Thanks.

751
01:11:49,569 --> 01:11:51,867
Come on.

752
01:11:54,173 --> 01:11:57,506
- Write me.
- But I don't have your address.

753
01:11:57,577 --> 01:12:00,341
Shakespeare does.

754
01:12:41,554 --> 01:12:44,079
Huh!

755
01:12:56,135 --> 01:12:58,433
Bye, Father.
I'll see you in a few months.

756
01:13:22,095 --> 01:13:24,689
Looks like we got us a horse thief.

757
01:13:25,732 --> 01:13:27,757
Let's go get him, boys.

758
01:13:42,949 --> 01:13:44,940
Oh.

759
01:14:02,401 --> 01:14:04,392
Get up.

760
01:14:10,076 --> 01:14:14,206
-Jeff. Is that right?
- You know my name.

761
01:14:19,152 --> 01:14:24,180
Abel here tells me he caught you
stealing one of our horses- red-handed.

762
01:14:24,257 --> 01:14:26,316
Like I told him...

763
01:14:26,392 --> 01:14:29,020
Colette gave me the horse
to return it to the Kleins.

764
01:14:29,095 --> 01:14:32,258
This must have been a conspiracy
that you made up with the Kleins.

765
01:14:32,331 --> 01:14:35,596
I mean, them being as good a friends
to your family and all.

766
01:14:35,668 --> 01:14:37,898
Henry and Melinda don't know
anything about this.

767
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:39,961
Listen to me, son.

768
01:14:40,039 --> 01:14:42,564
I can't help you
unless you get honest with me.

769
01:14:42,642 --> 01:14:45,611
You wanna know
what we do to horse thieves?

770
01:14:45,678 --> 01:14:48,238
We're gonna handle
this one by the books.

771
01:14:48,314 --> 01:14:50,612
I'm taking you into town.

772
01:14:52,585 --> 01:14:55,247
That sheriff ain't gonna do
nothin' to one of his own.

773
01:14:55,321 --> 01:14:59,257
William LaHaye is a man of the law.

774
01:14:59,325 --> 01:15:02,817
And, uh, I don't have any doubt...

775
01:15:02,895 --> 01:15:05,728
he'll do the right thing.

776
01:15:05,798 --> 01:15:08,767
Now get this trash out of my house.

777
01:15:13,673 --> 01:15:16,073
Whoa. Steady now.

778
01:15:19,946 --> 01:15:22,779
I think we're gonna have a healthy crop this year.

779
01:15:30,290 --> 01:15:32,349
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

780
01:15:32,425 --> 01:15:36,122
Did you seeJesse?
Be sure he gets the chain where he needs it.

781
01:15:36,195 --> 01:15:38,993
Get on down, sonny.

782
01:15:39,065 --> 01:15:41,966
Come on. We got a long day ahead of us.

783
01:15:42,035 --> 01:15:44,026
Git.

784
01:15:46,873 --> 01:15:48,898
Jeff.

785
01:15:53,212 --> 01:15:55,680
Well, I got another prisoner
for you, Sheriff.

786
01:15:55,748 --> 01:15:58,512
You need to lock him up
until the federal marshal arrives.

787
01:15:58,585 --> 01:16:00,246
Get your hand off my boy.

788
01:16:02,722 --> 01:16:06,624
My men-They caught him
dead to rights on a stolen horse.

789
01:16:06,693 --> 01:16:10,686
Oh, it's true enough.
I'm an eyewitness along with my men.

790
01:16:10,763 --> 01:16:15,598
And the last I heard, horse thieves-
They get the noose around these parts.

791
01:16:15,668 --> 01:16:19,331
But I might be willin'
to drop the charges as long...

792
01:16:19,405 --> 01:16:21,669
as he leaves and never returns.

793
01:16:21,741 --> 01:16:25,837
Just slow down, Doros. I mean, there's
gotta be some kind of misunderstanding.

794
01:16:25,912 --> 01:16:29,313
No. No, there's no misunderstanding.

795
01:16:30,383 --> 01:16:32,578
I mean, the boy- He took my horse.

796
01:16:32,652 --> 01:16:34,643
That's my property.

797
01:16:36,222 --> 01:16:38,520
You both would swear to that
in front of a judge?

798
01:16:38,591 --> 01:16:41,788
- On a stack of Bibles.
- You're gonna take my boy away from me?

799
01:16:41,861 --> 01:16:44,659
I'd send my own daughter to jail...

800
01:16:44,731 --> 01:16:47,325
if I knew she was a thief.

801
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:51,063
You can't let something like family
interfere with the law, LaHaye.

802
01:16:51,137 --> 01:16:54,072
You know, Doros...

803
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:56,165
for once I agree with you.

804
01:16:56,242 --> 01:16:57,470
Well-

805
01:17:14,394 --> 01:17:16,259
How could you?

806
01:17:16,329 --> 01:17:18,320
Colette, baby.

807
01:17:18,398 --> 01:17:20,593
I put you on that stage myself.

808
01:17:20,667 --> 01:17:23,158
Oh, I stopped the stage.
I can, you know.

809
01:17:23,236 --> 01:17:27,730
When I happened to see the horse
in my corral, I asked Jeff about it.

810
01:17:27,807 --> 01:17:31,174
He told me Colette wanted to give the horse
back to the Kleins.

811
01:17:31,244 --> 01:17:35,772
See, I knew a snake like you
just might be up to something.

812
01:17:35,848 --> 01:17:37,839
Something that might
get my boy into trouble.

813
01:17:37,917 --> 01:17:40,511
So I went after Colette
as a witness.

814
01:17:40,586 --> 01:17:43,384
Just in case there was
any kind of misunderstanding.

815
01:17:43,456 --> 01:17:46,789
Looks like I make a better sheriff
than even I knew.

816
01:17:52,265 --> 01:17:56,361
What are you gonna do? I mean,
do you honestly think you could get...

817
01:17:56,436 --> 01:17:58,836
my daughter...

818
01:17:58,905 --> 01:18:01,567
to testify against me?

819
01:18:05,778 --> 01:18:07,712
Colette.

820
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:10,214
It's like you said, Father.

821
01:18:10,283 --> 01:18:14,083
You can't let something like family
get in the way of the law.

822
01:18:14,153 --> 01:18:16,417
Colette.

823
01:18:23,129 --> 01:18:25,120
What do you want, LaHaye?

824
01:18:30,837 --> 01:18:32,828
These are my terms.

825
01:18:38,878 --> 01:18:41,403
That's one of my favorite dresses on you.

826
01:18:42,615 --> 01:18:44,606
Thank you.

827
01:18:44,684 --> 01:18:48,245
I think you forgot somethin'.
Turn around.

828
01:19:00,133 --> 01:19:02,124
Oh!

829
01:19:08,374 --> 01:19:10,365
Now you look perfect.

830
01:19:10,443 --> 01:19:12,911
- How?
- Well, you stopped wearing the locket...

831
01:19:12,979 --> 01:19:16,608
about the time Henry and Melinda
came up with the money for Doros.

832
01:19:16,682 --> 01:19:18,707
I just figured it out.

833
01:19:18,785 --> 01:19:21,982
- You didn't tell Henry or Melinda-
- No.

834
01:19:22,054 --> 01:19:24,181
No. That's still your secret.

835
01:19:24,257 --> 01:19:26,885
How did you get it?
We don't have any money.

836
01:19:26,959 --> 01:19:29,189
Got my first paycheck.

837
01:19:30,496 --> 01:19:32,691
Couldn't think of anything else
we needed more.

838
01:19:32,765 --> 01:19:35,325
Thank you.

839
01:19:35,401 --> 01:19:37,631
Thank you for getting it back.

840
01:19:46,412 --> 01:19:49,142
- There you go, Cookie.
- Thank you.

841
01:19:49,215 --> 01:19:51,911
Oh, everything looks so good.

842
01:19:51,984 --> 01:19:54,748
Everything looks good.
All these nice rolls and

843
01:19:54,821 --> 01:19:58,086
- How are you?
- Good, Melinda. How are you?

844
01:20:10,603 --> 01:20:14,869
- Nice party.
- Yeah. Lots of happy folks.

845
01:20:14,941 --> 01:20:17,535
Yes,you batter that chicken up
with some nice cayenne pepper-

846
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:22,274
- Smells so good.
- Hey, you boys! Get out of here!

847
01:20:22,348 --> 01:20:24,339
You come around here
stealing all of my chicken.

848
01:20:24,417 --> 01:20:26,351
You're worse than
an old fox in a henhouse.

849
01:20:26,419 --> 01:20:30,014
You gonna come round here
gettin' the best part of my chicken too.

850
01:20:31,824 --> 01:20:33,758
Excuse me.

851
01:20:39,398 --> 01:20:42,424
Mr. Paxson.
Can I get you anything?

852
01:20:42,501 --> 01:20:45,993
Well, I'd say you and your husband
done plenty for me, ma'am.

853
01:20:46,072 --> 01:20:48,063
I'm back at my ranch.

854
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:51,109
- Oh, I'm so happy for you.
- Yeah.

855
01:20:51,177 --> 01:20:53,111
I telegraphed
my wife and daughter...

856
01:20:53,179 --> 01:20:55,875
told 'em we got a roof
back over our heads again, and, uh...

857
01:20:55,948 --> 01:20:57,916
got a message back
saying they're coming home.

858
01:20:57,984 --> 01:21:00,475
- That is so wonderful.
- Yeah, it is.

859
01:21:10,329 --> 01:21:12,820
Excuse me. Please.

860
01:21:12,899 --> 01:21:14,890
Sure.

861
01:21:23,542 --> 01:21:25,772
Tell you what. It's gonna
take me a month of Sundays...

862
01:21:25,845 --> 01:21:28,473
when I get home for me
to tell your mother about my trip.

863
01:21:28,547 --> 01:21:31,812
Oh, well, you could make plans
to stay and make some more memories.

864
01:21:31,884 --> 01:21:34,910
Oh. There'll be future visits.
I promise you that.

865
01:21:34,987 --> 01:21:38,320
Now, in the meantime,
I seem to recall...

866
01:21:38,391 --> 01:21:41,792
that I taught my little girl
how to dance once upon a time.

867
01:21:41,861 --> 01:21:45,763
- Oh!

868
01:21:45,831 --> 01:21:47,958
Whoo-hoo!

869
01:22:11,691 --> 01:22:14,285
Take care of yourself, son.

870
01:22:15,294 --> 01:22:17,228
Come here, you.

871
01:22:17,296 --> 01:22:20,732
Oh, my goodness.
You're gettin' big.

872
01:22:22,068 --> 01:22:24,332
- You mind your folks.
- Okay.

873
01:22:26,272 --> 01:22:29,002
- I love you.
- I love you too, Grandpa.

874
01:22:30,476 --> 01:22:32,501
Thank you for all the help.

875
01:22:32,578 --> 01:22:35,411
Made a huge difference
when all of us were in a bad way.

876
01:22:35,481 --> 01:22:38,746
I seem to recall
you doing it for me once.

877
01:22:42,154 --> 01:22:44,486
- You have a safe trip.
- You too, son.

878
01:22:44,557 --> 01:22:46,855
- Say hi to Marty for me.
- I will.

879
01:22:46,926 --> 01:22:50,362
That was bound to happen.

880
01:22:59,238 --> 01:23:02,605
- Give Mom a big hug for me.
- I will.

881
01:23:02,675 --> 01:23:05,041
And Arnie. And Aaron.

882
01:23:05,111 --> 01:23:06,703
Oh, I will.

883
01:23:08,114 --> 01:23:12,278
Oh. I'm so thankful
that you were here with us, Pa.

884
01:23:12,351 --> 01:23:15,377
- I don't know what we would
have done without you.

885
01:23:15,454 --> 01:23:17,786
There are no mistakes, Missie.

886
01:23:17,857 --> 01:23:20,382
God's timing is always perfect.

887
01:23:21,827 --> 01:23:24,125
Even if we don't
realize it at the time.

888
01:23:26,499 --> 01:23:28,490
Come here.

889
01:23:30,770 --> 01:23:33,898
I don't want to let go.

890
01:23:33,973 --> 01:23:36,271
You keep those cards and letters comin',
you hear?

891
01:23:41,914 --> 01:23:45,543
Especially now that I can place
those beautiful faces with the names.

892
01:23:52,825 --> 01:23:55,123
I love you, sweetheart...

893
01:23:55,194 --> 01:23:58,823
- more than anything in the world.
- I love you too, Pa.

894
01:23:58,898 --> 01:24:00,593
Bye.

895
01:24:13,546 --> 01:24:15,411
Go get your sister.

896
01:24:17,183 --> 01:24:19,583
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye.

897
01:24:19,652 --> 01:24:22,280
Hup, Lucy! Hup, Dobbin!
