Nobody's hurt, but Vic is gone.

Sean. Take a breath, tell me what happened.

178

Vic went down the road to get some help,

179
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:08,136
and soon after, a car came
from that same direction.

And as it passed, I could see the driver,

I didn't do anything with her,

why are you out here?

00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:41,357
- I've been keeping an eye on her.
- You mean stalking her.

219

The language of most

About 2 miles.

I don't know, actually.

I wish I could, but I can
tell you don't trust me.

Or is this just another one of your games?

294
00:14:12,304 --> 00:14:15,337
Like sending her husband
a photo of Vic and me.

295
00:14:15,338 --> 00:14:17,170
What makes you think I sent a picture?

296
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:20,337
You wrote "32" on the back.

297
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:23,837
Vic told me that was a little
secret between the two of you.

298
00:14:23,838 --> 00:14:28,370
Did she describe room 32 to you?

299
00:14:28,371 --> 00:14:31,270
I wasn't interested in anything
but the fact that it proved

300
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:34,236
you never left Wyoming,
like you were told to.

301
00:14:34,237 --> 00:14:37,403
So, Ed, apart from stalking my Deputy,

302
00:14:37,404 --> 00:14:39,750
what else you been up to?

303
00:14:39,751 --> 00:14:41,917
You made any friends?

304
00:14:41,918 --> 00:14:44,696
I-I found a dentist I liked, thanks to you.

305
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:46,597
I wouldn't say we're friends.

306
00:14:46,598 --> 00:14:49,863
How do you know Chance Gilbert?

307
00:14:49,864 --> 00:14:54,279
The names out here, you
just don't get 'em back east.

308
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,713
So it's just a coincidence
that Vic disappears

309
00:14:57,714 --> 00:15:01,213
in his part of the county at
the same time as you appear?

The guy's smart.

318

He served as his own
attorney in a murder trial

319
00:15:25,114 --> 00:15:27,579
and got himself acquitted.

I killed his brother a few
years ago in a standoff.

Gorski looks to have been pulled
into an I.A. investigation.

Dunno.

when those guys abducted him on the road.

you are being accused of the following.

you are being held accountable
for the murder of my brother,

committed by your superior,
one Walter Longmire.

trespassing sovereign territory.

yourself and your intentions,
