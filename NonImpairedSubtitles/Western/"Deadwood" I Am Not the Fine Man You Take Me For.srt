1
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,070
I am not the fine man you take me for

2
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,320
No no

3
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,710
I come in April to sell a string of horses 

4
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,510
and try my luck 

5
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,210
in the streams

6
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,640
What I got for the stock 

7
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,070
I lost at the wheel,

8
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,410
and the flake I washed up 

9
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,480
I drank the fuck away

10
00:02:25,276 --> 00:02:27,703
I don't know as I'll get home at all

11
00:02:28,972 --> 00:02:30,551
I sold my boots

12
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,004
I owe $9 to a whore

13
00:03:16,423 --> 00:03:17,419
It looks like he

14
00:03:17,678 --> 00:03:19,001
fell off the platform

15
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:21,400
It's just a broke-necked hoople, Al

16
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:25,162
That he posed us no threat was the judgment you come to even as you fuckin' snored

17
00:03:25,428 --> 00:03:26,622
Turns on watch, Johnny,

18
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:28,801
until this Goddamn Hearst business settles out

19
00:03:28,778 --> 00:03:30,402
And not that we lack options

20
00:03:31,147 --> 00:03:32,860
like the sleep from which none awaken

21
00:03:34,107 --> 00:03:35,332
Would you close your flap, 

22
00:03:35,896 --> 00:03:37,632
that I don't forego my boiled eggs?

23
00:04:03,457 --> 00:04:05,550
Do you believe the speeches will be delivered tonight?

24
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:07,060
The speeches

25
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,162
the elections are hostage to the business of the camp,

26
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:13,040
which is bloody…

27
00:04:15,698 --> 00:04:16,343
murderous

28
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:21,723
And, you know…

29
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,032
I don't like this tea

30
00:04:25,757 --> 00:04:26,470
Too cool?

31
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:27,940
It's too weak

32
00:04:28,475 --> 00:04:30,310
I do not make weak tea

33
00:04:31,025 --> 00:04:32,202
I oughtn't to tease 

34
00:04:37,555 --> 00:04:38,972
I like mine unusually strong

35
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:40,211
You might have said, Seth

36
00:04:40,516 --> 00:04:41,623
It's an easy thing to fix

37
00:04:41,955 --> 00:04:42,373
You're right

38
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:43,693
I'm not a mind reader

39
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:44,962
I've said it now

40
00:04:45,497 --> 00:04:46,500
My goodness

41
00:05:05,778 --> 00:05:06,630
How am I?

42
00:05:07,937 --> 00:05:09,173
I could wish your symptoms 

43
00:05:09,605 --> 00:05:10,611
further remitted

44
00:05:11,337 --> 00:05:12,452
I find your answer vague

45
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,370
Doctor, has your medicine 

46
00:05:15,455 --> 00:05:18,043
dulled my faculties or do you wish to cloud your meaning?

47
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:20,900
You don't do as well as I'd hoped

48
00:05:23,786 --> 00:05:25,290
Am I know losing my baby?

49
00:05:25,865 --> 00:05:26,731
My opinion is 

50
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:28,440
you will

51
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:31,751
And your symptoms make it prudent 

52
00:05:32,128 --> 00:05:32,970
to intervene

53
00:05:34,855 --> 00:05:36,053
You're pained at the stomach

54
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:36,590
I'd

55
00:05:36,777 --> 00:05:37,381
I'd laid that

56
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:40,163
to, to your medicine slowing my digestion

57
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:42,202
The spasm in the

58
00:05:43,005 --> 00:05:46,233
muscles of your belly doesn't owe to slowed 

59
00:05:46,508 --> 00:05:47,331
digestion

60
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:50,633
And while you are bleeding less, that you bleed at all 

61
00:05:51,006 --> 00:05:52,090
with pain at the abdomen 

62
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:54,663
argues against further delay

63
00:05:55,928 --> 00:05:56,841
Have I time 

64
00:05:57,126 --> 00:05:58,941
to see to certain arrangements?

65
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:02,452
May I begin to see to mine? 

66
00:06:16,236 --> 00:06:18,003
I should be back in about…

67
00:06:19,316 --> 00:06:21,020
an hour and a half's time

68
00:06:33,536 --> 00:06:35,462
Put your school things together, little one

69
00:06:45,597 --> 00:06:47,332
If we know Hearst is coming, Boss, 

70
00:06:47,646 --> 00:06:49,372
why the fuck don't we strike first?

71
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:51,593
From the moment we leave the forest, Dan,

72
00:06:52,836 --> 00:06:54,570
it's all a giving up and adjusting

73
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:57,520
Across the thoroughfare to slit that cocksucker's throat

74
00:06:57,967 --> 00:06:58,873
We forego the rock 

75
00:06:59,255 --> 00:06:59,953
for the dagger, 

76
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:02,570
arn distraction's use and deceptions 

77
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:05,301
before the dagger is employed

78
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:06,311
spirits, women, 

79
00:07:06,778 --> 00:07:07,660
games of chance

80
00:07:08,568 --> 00:07:12,113
I'm older, and I'm much less friendly to fuckin' change

81
00:07:12,187 --> 00:07:13,510
Change ain't lookin' for friends

82
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:16,610
Change calls the tune we dance to

83
00:07:20,387 --> 00:07:21,390
Where are you going? 

84
00:07:25,897 --> 00:07:26,991
Whiskey, Captain?

85
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:42,430
Morning, Miss Sunshine

86
00:07:43,118 --> 00:07:43,681
Mornin', Cy

87
00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:49,892
What can you tell a man at the margin of things?

88
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:50,990
Reason for these 

89
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,263
cancelled  speeches?

90
00:07:53,576 --> 00:07:55,282
I don't know why they was cancelled

91
00:07:57,486 --> 00:07:58,831
You seem a little sour

92
00:08:01,645 --> 00:08:02,333
Don't think 

93
00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:05,063
lying here these weeks, I ain't had my dark moments 

94
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:09,830
Thank God I took this book up again

95
00:08:11,815 --> 00:08:13,683
If it really brings you peace, then I'm glad

96
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:15,512
Hell, yes, it brings me peace

97
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,032
Do you doubt that?

98
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:19,490
I try to believe

99
00:08:20,905 --> 00:08:22,501
You want to read something with me, Honey?

100
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:27,902
"Same as you want to find a different way, then why couldn't Cy?"

101
00:08:28,316 --> 00:08:30,431
Getting gut-stabbed by a Minister of God will 

102
00:08:30,715 --> 00:08:32,382
bring you to examine your path

103
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:34,343
But I don't

104
00:08:39,546 --> 00:08:42,010
I had a gun to my ear at Shaunessy's yesterday

105
00:08:42,927 --> 00:08:44,363
What the hell were you doing at Shaunessy's?

106
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:46,291
Staying away from here

107
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,680
You listen to me, young lady

108
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,981
What brings a gun to the temple

109
00:08:54,888 --> 00:08:58,322
is lack of gainful occupation and of being useful to others!

110
00:08:59,657 --> 00:09:01,410
I don't see you try to kill yourself here

111
00:09:02,438 --> 00:09:04,752
All you do here is good for the girls, and me too

112
00:09:05,436 --> 00:09:07,263
I don't want to run women no more

113
00:09:08,177 --> 00:09:10,172
And that's turning from your gift

114
00:09:10,648 --> 00:09:11,720
and your training!

115
00:09:12,938 --> 00:09:15,252
When you speak, I feel like it's the devil talking

116
00:09:18,298 --> 00:09:21,093
Ain't that a lovely thing to hear yourself accused of?

117
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,290
Excuse me, Mr. T, but 

118
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,191
fucking Lila's in extremis

119
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,713
Jesus Christ!

120
00:09:32,757 --> 00:09:33,720
Ought I get the Doc? 

121
00:09:34,028 --> 00:09:35,050
Leon  seems over his head

122
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:39,553
She'll see to it

123
00:09:40,017 --> 00:09:40,523
Yeah

124
00:09:46,345 --> 00:09:48,722
Try to stay afloat from the fuckin' sickbed,

125
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:52,023
have to listen to something like that

126
00:09:57,617 --> 00:09:58,983
Get the fuck inside, Leon,

127
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:00,702
before I take out my gun and kill you!

128
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:01,740
Joanie this ain't the way it looks

129
00:10:02,277 --> 00:10:03,463
Get inside or get shot!

130
00:10:03,826 --> 00:10:04,802
Well, hold her up then!

131
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:06,862
Got a long fuckin' way to fall down

132
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,282
Let me die, Joanie

133
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:10,553
Start walking, you lousy whore

134
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:12,113
Start walking

135
00:10:27,115 --> 00:10:29,003
Slept inside, in case you wasn't aware

136
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:31,273
Miss Stubbs' request

137
00:10:33,105 --> 00:10:35,921
Thought she'd try someone competent keeping watch

138
00:10:41,577 --> 00:10:43,082
She's off to the Bella Union

139
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,832
I can't worry about her right now

140
00:10:45,046 --> 00:10:47,530
Can you just help me lug in the fucking water?

141
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:49,162
I'm for the day

142
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,250
off the bottle 

143
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:51,620
and about to bathe

144
00:10:54,182 --> 00:10:55,871
Camp get up a petition?

145
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,924
I can sniff this all you want, Boss, but I

146
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:19,909
I ain't got one fuckin' scintilla of an idea what these marks mean

147
00:11:21,418 --> 00:11:23,421
What if that's the door of our joint?

148
00:11:26,558 --> 00:11:27,260
That would make 

149
00:11:28,268 --> 00:11:29,261
this line 

150
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:30,423
the bar

151
00:11:31,995 --> 00:11:33,580
What would that make the Xs?

152
00:11:33,997 --> 00:11:34,890
Murderers?

153
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:40,202
See to your task with the Jew

154
00:11:55,565 --> 00:11:57,631
A few fuckin' things history proves:

155
00:11:58,497 --> 00:11:59,301
you sit still, 

156
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:03,093
you fuckin' memorize, you repeat back what you fuckin' learn, 

157
00:12:03,517 --> 00:12:04,101
or,

158
00:12:04,478 --> 00:12:05,420
choosing otherwise,

159
00:12:05,785 --> 00:12:09,301
you display your knuckles to be struck fuckin' bloody on the fuckin' desk!

160
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:13,281
That how you gonna 

161
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:15,481
start your talk to the children?

162
00:12:15,565 --> 00:12:17,132
Shut the fuck up, Mose!

163
00:12:18,065 --> 00:12:20,313
And don't tease me at a crucial fuckin' hour

164
00:12:25,335 --> 00:12:25,963
Can I 

165
00:12:26,605 --> 00:12:26,972
listen? 

166
00:12:32,438 --> 00:12:33,412
From outside, 

167
00:12:34,168 --> 00:12:35,900
at your post near the shitter

168
00:12:45,788 --> 00:12:48,313
Could you have been born, Richardson,

169
00:12:49,265 --> 00:12:51,932
and not egg-hatched as I've always assumed?

170
00:12:52,826 --> 00:12:54,643
Did your mother hover over you, 

171
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:57,043
snaggle-toothed and 

172
00:12:57,415 --> 00:12:59,593
doting, as you now hover over me?

173
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:01,850
I loved my mother

174
00:13:02,308 --> 00:13:03,273
Puberty may 

175
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,620
bring you to understand

176
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:07,792
what we take for mother love 

177
00:13:08,077 --> 00:13:11,541
is really murderous hatred and a desire for revenge

178
00:13:12,565 --> 00:13:14,700
Will you give your speech to be Mayor tonight?

179
00:13:17,316 --> 00:13:18,291
Whatever night I give it,

180
00:13:18,535 --> 00:13:19,963
count on me not to mince words

181
00:13:22,195 --> 00:13:23,472
"Electors of the camp, 

182
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:25,441
as to who should serve as Mayor,

183
00:13:26,695 --> 00:13:28,073
reasonable men may differ

184
00:13:28,795 --> 00:13:30,431
But as to who should be Sheriff…

185
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:33,850
we all ought to speak with one voice

186
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:35,212
And our words should be, 

187
00:13:35,477 --> 00:13:36,963
'turn out the maniac Bullock,

188
00:13:37,645 --> 00:13:38,761
who set upon the Mayor 

189
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:40,260
unprovoked, who beat him 

190
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:42,691
with merciless protraction.'

191
00:13:44,306 --> 00:13:45,543
Bullock should be murdered!

192
00:13:45,996 --> 00:13:46,700
We should rise up 

193
00:13:47,096 --> 00:13:47,970
and murder Bullock!

194
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:50,741
Thank you very much."

195
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,140
My father didn't like me

196
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:02,011
I'd  like to use your ointment to suffocate you

197
00:14:25,485 --> 00:14:27,023
May the little one walk with you? 

198
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:28,410
Is that all right?

199
00:14:28,975 --> 00:14:29,621
Of course

200
00:14:34,037 --> 00:14:35,393
My mother's sick

201
00:14:47,395 --> 00:14:48,931
We're closed for the next 15 minutes

202
00:14:54,298 --> 00:14:54,950
Whiskey

203
00:14:55,256 --> 00:14:55,812
Beer

204
00:15:04,858 --> 00:15:07,180
I'm  concerned it might be taken as provocation

205
00:15:08,058 --> 00:15:11,760
me serving his whiskey before you getting your beer, or the very reversal of that

206
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:12,910
Just bring the whiskey

207
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:15,480
Fuckin' beer

208
00:15:18,165 --> 00:15:18,660
And 

209
00:15:18,938 --> 00:15:20,460
these others, they friends of yours 

210
00:15:20,776 --> 00:15:21,812
that come in on your heels? 

211
00:15:22,578 --> 00:15:23,890
You friends of these boys, fellas?

212
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,831
Should I be taking your orders 

213
00:15:28,756 --> 00:15:29,670
all together?

214
00:15:32,796 --> 00:15:33,882
And was yours the fuckin' beer?

215
00:15:34,457 --> 00:15:35,582
Mine was the fuckin' whiskey

216
00:15:36,498 --> 00:15:37,543
Right then

217
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:39,573
Right you fuckin' are

218
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,700
Make a move, cocksuckers!

219
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:47,192
Don't you shoot 'em, Johnny!

220
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:52,201
If these fellas had been sent here to draw,

221
00:15:52,597 --> 00:15:54,130
I believe they'd have already done it

222
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:56,171
Go ahead

223
00:15:56,727 --> 00:15:57,533
Go on, fellas

224
00:15:58,007 --> 00:15:59,883
Mind the muck at the thoroughfare center

225
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:01,981
Debates are on for tonight, 

226
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,162
whoever you might want to tell

227
00:16:10,225 --> 00:16:13,140
I'll drink after I've ate

228
00:16:18,448 --> 00:16:19,450
Nuh-uh, no no

229
00:16:18,975 --> 00:16:19,863
You don't want

230
00:16:19,977 --> 00:16:20,500
you don't want to go in there

231
00:16:31,896 --> 00:16:33,510
Definitely a prudent investment

232
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:36,690
If I could control even one of my vices, 

233
00:16:36,877 --> 00:16:37,550
believe me,

234
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:39,272
I'd have kept the house myself

235
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:43,910
Excuse me

236
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:51,703
Oh, no

237
00:16:53,107 --> 00:16:54,451
That's what these are for

238
00:16:58,336 --> 00:17:00,870
Whether I ever fucking live there or not

239
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:04,193
My husband and I agreed 

240
00:17:04,715 --> 00:17:05,623
before marrying that 

241
00:17:07,307 --> 00:17:08,771
property held by either of us

242
00:17:09,346 --> 00:17:11,353
before our union would not be encumbered by our 

243
00:17:11,776 --> 00:17:12,481
marriage

244
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,783
As to such properties held…

245
00:17:17,135 --> 00:17:17,753
by me…

246
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:20,851
I name my ward Sofia 

247
00:17:21,737 --> 00:17:22,463
inheritor

248
00:17:24,465 --> 00:17:25,140
I've heard her

249
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:28,310
I wish no amendment 

250
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,690
as to guardianship 

251
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:33,720
or administration of those properties

252
00:17:38,737 --> 00:17:39,543
I've heard her

253
00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:44,422
Ought not Mr. Bullock be present to accept?

254
00:17:48,615 --> 00:17:50,640
This is property before our marriage

255
00:17:51,285 --> 00:17:52,852
I know what it is

256
00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:56,911
Don't he need to accept,

257
00:17:58,338 --> 00:18:00,920
being steward now to Sofia's interests?

258
00:18:02,175 --> 00:18:03,521
Why don't I go fetch him?

259
00:18:15,475 --> 00:18:17,182
We have a special guest with us today

260
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,243
Miss Jane Cannary

261
00:18:21,888 --> 00:18:23,222
An  Indian scout!

262
00:18:24,317 --> 00:18:25,773
There's a child I know

263
00:18:26,317 --> 00:18:27,013
Sofia

264
00:18:33,027 --> 00:18:33,971
Anyways, um, 

265
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:38,763
I was a scout for Armstrong Custer

266
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:39,613
George

267
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,701
You're right, but I always called him

268
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:44,780
"General" to his face,

269
00:18:45,596 --> 00:18:47,263
and "Armstrong" behind his back

270
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:47,911
Why?

271
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:48,600
James

272
00:18:50,407 --> 00:18:51,442
I guess I…

273
00:18:53,247 --> 00:18:55,422
always spoke of him as "Armstrong" 

274
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:57,862
'cause he seemed puffed up to me,

275
00:18:58,456 --> 00:19:00,631
and "Armstrong" has a puffed up sound

276
00:19:06,856 --> 00:19:09,182
Any quarrel with me continuing, James? 

277
00:19:09,457 --> 00:19:10,160
Go ahead

278
00:19:13,976 --> 00:19:14,550
Uh-oh

279
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:18,511
Why say "uh-oh"? 

280
00:19:19,665 --> 00:19:22,210
If you don't mean to go on to explain yourself, 

281
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:24,051
why say anything at all?!

282
00:19:25,487 --> 00:19:29,681
Do you only feign stupidity while in fact plotting ways to madden me?!

283
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:31,671
No

284
00:19:32,435 --> 00:19:33,250
Why did you say it? 

285
00:19:33,828 --> 00:19:35,961
Why did you say "Uh-oh"?!

286
00:19:36,495 --> 00:19:37,873
It's the Sheriff that beat you

287
00:19:40,237 --> 00:19:41,922
Now comes Mr. Hearst

288
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:47,152
Gentlemen

289
00:20:04,096 --> 00:20:05,682
Two of his men throat-cut,

290
00:20:06,257 --> 00:20:08,392
and he he picks the fuckin' fish

291
00:20:12,565 --> 00:20:13,671
Why do you think the men were his?

292
00:20:21,306 --> 00:20:22,943
My wife would like to see you

293
00:20:36,515 --> 00:20:37,193
Kinda warm

294
00:20:39,055 --> 00:20:39,893
The man 

295
00:20:40,395 --> 00:20:41,200
didn't listen

296
00:20:41,946 --> 00:20:43,883
his basic fundamental problem

297
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:47,102
He'd look at hisself in the mirror when you'd make your report

298
00:20:47,476 --> 00:20:48,123
Once I said to him 

299
00:20:48,376 --> 00:20:49,591
how thin his waist was…

300
00:20:50,186 --> 00:20:52,053
and how pretty I found his hair,

301
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:53,591
use to get him to turn around, 

302
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:54,350
which he did

303
00:20:54,997 --> 00:20:56,291
to tell me get out of his tent

304
00:20:57,347 --> 00:20:58,220
So…

305
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,752
I guess my lesson I got to teach you

306
00:21:04,195 --> 00:21:05,001
listen 

307
00:21:05,587 --> 00:21:06,573
and you won't get scalped

308
00:21:09,638 --> 00:21:11,491
And don't look at yourself too much in the mirror

309
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:14,331
What else I found puffy

310
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:19,352
he traveled with a dozen caged animals like you'd see in some zoo in the east

311
00:21:19,888 --> 00:21:22,881
Like we don't have enough wild animals around here, huh? 

312
00:21:27,156 --> 00:21:28,143
Let us all thank Jane 

313
00:21:29,145 --> 00:21:30,641
for her bravery here today

314
00:21:30,968 --> 00:21:33,423
Thank you, Jane

315
00:21:34,157 --> 00:21:36,322
I know another brave person here, too

316
00:21:38,127 --> 00:21:39,050
Several

317
00:21:41,148 --> 00:21:41,611
More

318
00:21:42,395 --> 00:21:43,930
More more more more

319
00:21:44,797 --> 00:21:46,322
More more

320
00:21:47,927 --> 00:21:48,881
All right

321
00:21:50,525 --> 00:21:51,120
Wider

322
00:21:52,336 --> 00:21:52,971
Not you!

323
00:21:55,768 --> 00:21:56,203
All right

324
00:21:57,997 --> 00:21:58,553
All right

325
00:22:03,857 --> 00:22:05,513
Sofia must be protected

326
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:08,491
If my first husband's family 

327
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:11,192
attacks Sofias title in court,

328
00:22:12,525 --> 00:22:14,441
Mr. Hearst might be approached as a purchaser

329
00:22:16,796 --> 00:22:18,391
I'm sure he could buy the relevant authorities

330
00:22:19,585 --> 00:22:20,211
All right

331
00:22:20,777 --> 00:22:22,473
Given his history with Hearst,

332
00:22:23,107 --> 00:22:25,183
I'd spare Mr. Ellsworth that indignity

333
00:22:26,797 --> 00:22:27,712
I understand

334
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:32,540
Thank you, Mr. Bullock

335
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:42,931
I regret nothing

336
00:23:28,728 --> 00:23:29,961
I bought the house

337
00:23:31,847 --> 00:23:32,282
The house

338
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:33,992
I bought it

339
00:23:35,787 --> 00:23:37,691
It  doesn't mean we have to move in together

340
00:23:44,647 --> 00:23:46,010
Please remind Sofia 

341
00:23:46,845 --> 00:23:48,632
that the full moon is in two days

342
00:23:49,836 --> 00:23:50,422
All right

343
00:23:56,237 --> 00:23:58,130
We three will watch it together

344
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:06,430
Davey is taking a chance not lettin' Al do the scrubbing

345
00:24:06,788 --> 00:24:08,443
That's Davey's fucking problem

346
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:24,810
All right

347
00:24:28,157 --> 00:24:29,930
Now Hearst…

348
00:24:31,328 --> 00:24:32,301
sent these two,

349
00:24:32,986 --> 00:24:34,122
the two you had the drop on

350
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:35,331
That didn't draw

351
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:37,090
Yeah, he

352
00:24:37,526 --> 00:24:39,033
sent the two that didn't draw, so that these two

353
00:24:39,628 --> 00:24:40,933
wouldn't be so quick to their irons

354
00:24:41,156 --> 00:24:42,561
And these two that you and Al murdered

355
00:24:44,098 --> 00:24:44,642
Correct

356
00:24:44,815 --> 00:24:45,332
These

357
00:24:45,598 --> 00:24:46,081
these two

358
00:24:47,215 --> 00:24:49,242
So, see, that give ma and Al time to cut their throats

359
00:24:51,328 --> 00:24:51,701
Now that 

360
00:24:52,515 --> 00:24:53,101
was Hearst

361
00:24:53,628 --> 00:24:54,880
showing Al his ass

362
00:24:56,557 --> 00:24:59,320
And sending this diagram ahead

363
00:24:59,787 --> 00:25:00,311
was him 

364
00:25:00,595 --> 00:25:01,781
signaling Al 

365
00:25:02,197 --> 00:25:02,833
his intention

366
00:25:03,187 --> 00:25:06,120
Well, it was his preliminary signaling that he was gonna show his ass,

367
00:25:06,658 --> 00:25:08,191
if Al was smart enough to know it

368
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:09,692
Now, otherwise,

369
00:25:10,035 --> 00:25:12,181
if Al didn't know it was coming,

370
00:25:12,045 --> 00:25:13,150
he'd have been surprised 

371
00:25:13,186 --> 00:25:15,350
when those two didn't back these two's play

372
00:25:15,857 --> 00:25:17,042
Well, thinking that Al 

373
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:20,100
would throw his hands up surprised shows that Hearst 

374
00:25:20,648 --> 00:25:21,830
ain't too smart!

375
00:25:23,215 --> 00:25:24,341
Aw, he's smart, Johnny

376
00:25:25,006 --> 00:25:27,700
I mean, they both, him and Al, are real fuckin' smart

377
00:25:33,227 --> 00:25:35,042
That'd knock a buzzard off a shit wagon

378
00:25:43,695 --> 00:25:44,561
I just

379
00:25:45,037 --> 00:25:47,901
I feel shunted aside or the like, not involved as much as previous

380
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:49,581
Adams, you were busy with Star…

381
00:25:49,865 --> 00:25:51,341
That you sent me off to see…

382
00:25:51,648 --> 00:25:54,160
Thinking you'd be back before time for the murders

383
00:25:54,475 --> 00:25:55,623
So it wasn't like a decision you made 

384
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:58,211
to have the murders while I was signing the papers?

385
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:01,581
You've no idea how fuckin' badly you're boring me

386
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:02,881
Yeah?

387
00:26:05,237 --> 00:26:07,070
That Captain's brought over another envelope

388
00:26:13,826 --> 00:26:15,903
Won't you see with me what this might portend?

389
00:26:17,178 --> 00:26:17,910
All right

390
00:26:22,908 --> 00:26:23,742
Drink? 

391
00:26:24,756 --> 00:26:25,920
Or won't you be staying?

392
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,232
Ask the fella who made them Xs 

393
00:26:34,847 --> 00:26:36,782
if he hires out for portraits

394
00:26:51,887 --> 00:26:52,771
What's Al doing?

395
00:26:53,158 --> 00:26:54,752
Like I fuckin' know

396
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:58,292
If we was trailing water, we might get took for ducklings

397
00:27:10,427 --> 00:27:13,033
"Come watch the speeches with me…"

398
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:13,711
um…

399
00:27:15,987 --> 00:27:17,363
It's written in awkward hand

400
00:27:17,707 --> 00:27:21,841
"Come watch the speeches with me on my veranda."

401
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:22,600
That's what it says

402
00:27:23,555 --> 00:27:25,752
What in God's name is going on? 

403
00:27:26,585 --> 00:27:29,073
And I inquire about more than that hole

404
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:34,940
These last months have made me expert

405
00:27:35,176 --> 00:27:36,922
It was gunfire, and it came from your saloon

406
00:27:37,147 --> 00:27:38,361
Has not the press a duty, Merrick, 

407
00:27:39,008 --> 00:27:41,261
qualifying its accounts in time of war?

408
00:27:41,646 --> 00:27:42,672
Are we at war now 

409
00:27:43,355 --> 00:27:44,211
here in the camp? 

410
00:27:44,606 --> 00:27:46,202
Has that fact been suppressed as well?

411
00:27:47,147 --> 00:27:50,072
Absent formal declaration, Al,

412
00:27:50,767 --> 00:27:54,531
which affects this community is not my prerogative to disseminate;

413
00:27:54,916 --> 00:27:57,213
to do so is my sacred responsibility

414
00:27:57,496 --> 00:27:59,962
Whores currently disseminating a dose, for example?

415
00:28:00,007 --> 00:28:01,931
To inform within decency's limits

416
00:28:02,367 --> 00:28:03,891
We've had this discussion before

417
00:28:04,177 --> 00:28:07,341
Citizens better die postulating than touch indecent ink

418
00:28:08,027 --> 00:28:09,321
Make a list of the infected whores 

419
00:28:09,916 --> 00:28:12,672
and account for this morning's gunfire, and I'll publish it all

420
00:28:12,826 --> 00:28:13,382
I won't,

421
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:14,752
fucking Merrick,

422
00:28:15,205 --> 00:28:16,991
because neither's to my fucking interests, 

423
00:28:17,277 --> 00:28:19,073
just as you owning a print press 

424
00:28:19,586 --> 00:28:21,530
proves only you've an interest in the truth, 

425
00:28:21,907 --> 00:28:23,612
meaning up to a fucking point

426
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:24,891
slightly

427
00:28:25,186 --> 00:28:26,142
more than us others

428
00:28:26,126 --> 00:28:26,670
maybe, 

429
00:28:27,265 --> 00:28:30,113
but short of a fucking anointing or the shouldering of a sacred burden, 

430
00:28:30,746 --> 00:28:32,933
unless of course the print press was gift of an angel

431
00:28:33,156 --> 00:28:35,010
I'd want to be there for that handoff myself

432
00:28:36,977 --> 00:28:39,413
Maybe you should print an extra saying the speeches are on again

433
00:28:40,855 --> 00:28:41,483
Tonight?

434
00:28:42,928 --> 00:28:44,602
What time do you think would be best? 

435
00:28:48,715 --> 00:28:51,331
Well, people tried keeping their thoughts to theirselves

436
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:57,453
Yes, sir?

437
00:28:57,686 --> 00:28:58,920
Will you mind, Charlie,

438
00:28:59,267 --> 00:29:00,763
not being noted tonight from the hustings?

439
00:29:01,236 --> 00:29:02,170
Be a Godsend

440
00:29:02,588 --> 00:29:03,822
Mrs. Ellsworth isn't well

441
00:29:06,107 --> 00:29:06,783
I'm sorry

442
00:29:13,028 --> 00:29:13,363
If, 

443
00:29:14,005 --> 00:29:14,440
while 

444
00:29:15,027 --> 00:29:15,691
I'm on that 

445
00:29:15,925 --> 00:29:17,081
Goddamn platform, you could 

446
00:29:17,795 --> 00:29:19,380
station outside her place…

447
00:29:20,248 --> 00:29:21,012
Sure I could

448
00:29:22,096 --> 00:29:23,863
Sol's speaking too, you see, or I'd ask him

449
00:29:25,385 --> 00:29:26,350
I'm glad to do it, Bullock

450
00:29:26,978 --> 00:29:28,072
Glad and fuckin' relieved

451
00:29:34,888 --> 00:29:36,272
Doc Cochran seeing to her?

452
00:29:39,938 --> 00:29:40,852
In good hands then

453
00:29:41,307 --> 00:29:42,941
And Mrs. Bullock sees to Sofia

454
00:29:46,246 --> 00:29:47,910
Don't that child thrive now, 

455
00:29:48,657 --> 00:29:49,741
with starting into school?

456
00:29:54,245 --> 00:29:56,832
Sweet as before and notably more outgoing

457
00:30:11,397 --> 00:30:12,303
Trixie will come out 

458
00:30:13,418 --> 00:30:14,882
from being in helping the Doc

459
00:30:15,588 --> 00:30:16,832
Likely to come out for a smoke

460
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,480
Fuckin' mail, huh?

461
00:30:41,187 --> 00:30:42,813
Uncharted territory, Harry

462
00:30:43,396 --> 00:30:44,931
Coming up on 14 minutes

463
00:30:45,298 --> 00:30:46,462
I don't care. I don't care 

464
00:30:46,758 --> 00:30:47,613
whatever you mean

465
00:30:48,288 --> 00:30:49,810
Readied as you were yesterday, 

466
00:30:50,255 --> 00:30:51,670
only to have the event deferred, 

467
00:30:52,577 --> 00:30:54,120
do you suppose it's nerves 

468
00:30:55,137 --> 00:30:57,733
about giving your speech has your bowels in upheaval?

469
00:30:57,835 --> 00:31:03,013
When you was a boy, Rutherford, I bet you was a hand at tying cans \Nto dogs' tails and setting cats ablaze 

470
00:31:03,415 --> 00:31:07,003
Or uncertainty when they'll be held?

471
00:31:12,035 --> 00:31:13,193
Overturning turtles 

472
00:31:14,288 --> 00:31:15,320
was my specialty

473
00:31:18,525 --> 00:31:19,201
Wake up, Lila

474
00:31:21,036 --> 00:31:21,722
Wake up

475
00:31:23,487 --> 00:31:24,921
Don't you close your eyes again

476
00:31:35,578 --> 00:31:36,993
How do you make it through?

477
00:31:39,026 --> 00:31:39,282
Go on, girl

478
00:31:39,335 --> 00:31:40,051
Get out

479
00:31:54,477 --> 00:31:55,910
Seven times through, Alma

480
00:31:56,647 --> 00:31:58,323
I'm healthy as a fuckin' horse

481
00:32:01,056 --> 00:32:04,250
I trust you not to modify my instructions

482
00:32:05,238 --> 00:32:06,163
To the letter, Doc

483
00:32:07,585 --> 00:32:08,401
All right, begin

484
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:21,311
You'll be all right

485
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:24,012
All right

486
00:32:30,168 --> 00:32:31,331
Turn your head away 

487
00:32:31,968 --> 00:32:33,492
from the cloth and breathe

488
00:32:34,608 --> 00:32:36,372
Shut the fuck up and concentrate

489
00:32:37,116 --> 00:32:37,730
Turn 

490
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:38,440
your head 

491
00:32:38,478 --> 00:32:39,152
away 

492
00:32:39,195 --> 00:32:40,041
God damn it!

493
00:32:40,406 --> 00:32:43,250
What I'm use to, this is like smelling fucking posies!

494
00:32:43,436 --> 00:32:45,330
I would just as soon (? assure / assume)

495
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:47,530
that you not fucking pass out!

496
00:32:47,996 --> 00:32:48,970
When you're done with hers, Doc, 

497
00:32:49,245 --> 00:32:50,611
why don't you fucking kiss mine?!

498
00:33:11,185 --> 00:33:12,732
I'll be back in just a moment, Sofia

499
00:33:13,518 --> 00:33:15,012
Round the dough's ends

500
00:33:25,357 --> 00:33:26,193
Mrs. Ellsworth 

501
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,973
is being seen to by Dr. Cochran

502
00:33:31,507 --> 00:33:32,213
And 

503
00:33:32,726 --> 00:33:34,332
Trixie, I believe, is assisting him

504
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:43,110
I'll keep care of Sofia while you deliver your speech

505
00:33:48,207 --> 00:33:50,321
And we'll both pray for Mrs. Ellsworth

506
00:34:04,735 --> 00:34:05,663
Go on then

507
00:34:06,226 --> 00:34:09,020
Spend time finding spine to put the bullet in your brain

508
00:34:15,808 --> 00:34:17,332
Calls me the fucking devil

509
00:34:22,178 --> 00:34:23,830
Show me another fucking strategy

510
00:34:25,946 --> 00:34:27,952
Bedridden and liable to fucking slaughter

511
00:34:35,118 --> 00:34:37,572
Deception don't preclude the search 

512
00:34:38,758 --> 00:34:40,170
for fucking conviction

513
00:34:42,495 --> 00:34:43,343
When is "when"?

514
00:34:44,385 --> 00:34:45,591
You are a fucking stitch

515
00:34:46,465 --> 00:34:47,921
"About to begin" could mean anything

516
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:49,853
There's a crowd outside

517
00:34:50,368 --> 00:34:51,960
Are the speeches about to begin?

518
00:34:52,448 --> 00:34:53,212
Is "when" now?

519
00:34:53,965 --> 00:34:54,383
Oh, dear

520
00:34:54,738 --> 00:34:55,093
Oh, brother

521
00:34:55,508 --> 00:34:55,842
What is it?

522
00:34:56,225 --> 00:34:58,743
Only Andy Cramed, you drug-addled turd!

523
00:34:59,287 --> 00:34:59,622
Gentlemen

524
00:34:59,908 --> 00:35:00,360
Yes, sir

525
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:02,590
Yes, sirree. Reverend!

526
00:35:04,777 --> 00:35:05,993
Excuse me for just a moment! Reverend!

527
00:35:06,015 --> 00:35:06,673
Reverend!

528
00:35:08,688 --> 00:35:09,320
Guess you heard about 

529
00:35:09,745 --> 00:35:10,731
the Clergical discount 

530
00:35:11,647 --> 00:35:13,071
on wheel and faro both?

531
00:35:18,207 --> 00:35:19,093
Yes, Con?

532
00:35:19,746 --> 00:35:20,122
Andy Cramed 

533
00:35:20,728 --> 00:35:21,220
that stabbed you 

534
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,531
is outside with Leon, sir

535
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:23,973
Is he?

536
00:35:24,057 --> 00:35:24,361
Yes, sir

537
00:35:24,527 --> 00:35:25,061
Just come in

538
00:35:28,055 --> 00:35:29,283
Is his blade sheathed?

539
00:35:29,975 --> 00:35:30,753
No brandishin' no 

540
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:32,453
threatenin' gestures of any kind

541
00:35:33,587 --> 00:35:34,751
I'll see him, Con

542
00:36:06,835 --> 00:36:07,781
Reverend Cramed

543
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:09,831
Or are you an apparition?

544
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:11,221
It's me, Cy

545
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:14,023
Ain't that what a spirit would say?

546
00:36:15,698 --> 00:36:17,362
It's Andy Cramed in the flesh

547
00:36:18,047 --> 00:36:18,830
How are you, Cy?

548
00:36:20,685 --> 00:36:22,110
Well, I'd say overall

549
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:26,141
Though I'll never shit again without pain

550
00:36:26,698 --> 00:36:27,081
I'm sorry

551
00:36:28,016 --> 00:36:28,871
Now you ain't 

552
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:30,623
come to finish me off?

553
00:36:31,437 --> 00:36:32,933
To ask your forgiveness

554
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,792
And decide how to vote

555
00:36:36,747 --> 00:36:39,003
Coming for the speeches was my excuse

556
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:42,881
As far as stabbing me, Reverend, 

557
00:36:43,355 --> 00:36:45,432
you was sorely fuckin' provoked

558
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:48,212
I denied you'd been called,

559
00:36:48,575 --> 00:36:49,442
treated you like the 

560
00:36:49,847 --> 00:36:52,281
shitbag fuckin' operator you used to be

561
00:36:53,816 --> 00:36:57,373
I forgive you, Cy, as I come to beg your forgiveness

562
00:36:58,738 --> 00:36:59,670
The ribbon's 

563
00:37:00,047 --> 00:37:01,531
at Matthew 12, Reverend

564
00:37:03,148 --> 00:37:03,572
Could you read 

565
00:37:04,538 --> 00:37:06,090
verse 31 for me?

566
00:37:14,636 --> 00:37:20,062
"Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven 

567
00:37:20,466 --> 00:37:24,530
except blasphemy against the spirit."

568
00:37:26,606 --> 00:37:29,110
Couldn't Matthew be speaking of me there?

569
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:35,340
Oh, Christ Al-fuckin'-mighty, I'm so glad to fuckin' see you, Andy, with

570
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,423
with forgiveness in your fuckin' heart

571
00:37:39,655 --> 00:37:40,413
Oh…

572
00:37:41,377 --> 00:37:43,400
where is this strength coming from now?

573
00:37:43,857 --> 00:37:44,511
Where

574
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:46,812
 is this strength coming from that I feel 

575
00:37:47,258 --> 00:37:48,641
flowing into me,

576
00:37:48,978 --> 00:37:49,510
that lets 

577
00:37:49,748 --> 00:37:51,680
me sit up and try to fuckin' touch you, Andy, 

578
00:37:52,028 --> 00:37:53,093
if only you'll fuckin' let me?

579
00:37:54,145 --> 00:37:54,803
Fuck me!

580
00:37:55,686 --> 00:37:57,992
Fuckin' Jesus Christ Almighty!

581
00:37:58,266 --> 00:37:59,102
Can you feel 

582
00:37:59,356 --> 00:38:00,722
what's fuckin' moving here?

583
00:38:01,355 --> 00:38:02,941
It's moving in the room right now!

584
00:38:04,218 --> 00:38:05,420
If only you'd hold me, 

585
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:07,591
I believe I could walk

586
00:38:12,717 --> 00:38:15,591
Con said now may be when you ask to be told about

587
00:38:16,028 --> 00:38:18,160
Jesus Christ, you're well-arrived

588
00:38:18,557 --> 00:38:20,273
Would you have dope's cross 

589
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:21,553
off your shoulders, son?

590
00:38:22,878 --> 00:38:23,490
I know I'd

591
00:38:25,506 --> 00:38:26,371
like to take less

592
00:38:26,746 --> 00:38:28,612
Then fall to your fuckin' knees

593
00:38:29,296 --> 00:38:31,592
Get to your motherfuckin' knees, Leon,

594
00:38:31,896 --> 00:38:32,893
and ask the Lord 

595
00:38:33,206 --> 00:38:34,610
to lift your burden part-way

596
00:38:35,395 --> 00:38:35,913
Hear me!

597
00:38:37,945 --> 00:38:38,290
Lord!

598
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:41,522
Don't fuck with the fuckin' deity, Leon!

599
00:38:41,818 --> 00:38:43,810
You've got to come to him wholehearted,

600
00:38:44,265 --> 00:38:46,443
even you're asking for partial relief

601
00:38:48,008 --> 00:38:48,911
Oh, Lord! 

602
00:38:49,835 --> 00:38:51,241
Let Leon cut down,

603
00:38:51,598 --> 00:38:52,070
Lord,

604
00:38:52,405 --> 00:38:53,680
on the motherfuckin' dujie (?)

605
00:38:54,446 --> 00:38:54,952
Let him cut 

606
00:38:55,668 --> 00:38:56,640
way the fuck back

607
00:38:57,257 --> 00:38:59,333
I'll speak to you another time

608
00:39:01,127 --> 00:39:01,561
Oh! 

609
00:39:03,497 --> 00:39:06,163
Do you hear how I'm coming at him for you, Leon?

610
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:10,171
How I fully fuckin' supplicate the motherfucker? 

611
00:39:10,847 --> 00:39:11,571
Speeches are near 

612
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:12,661
commensurating, Sir

613
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:13,792
Now that's a definite

614
00:39:18,826 --> 00:39:20,470
Get the fuck up, Leon

615
00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:23,683
Help Con get me ready

616
00:39:25,378 --> 00:39:27,451
Any argument for us accompanying you over there, Boss

617
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:29,470
Don't strike the right note 

618
00:39:30,057 --> 00:39:31,261
going over there with seconds

619
00:39:31,688 --> 00:39:32,922
Know Goddamn well Hearst 

620
00:39:33,168 --> 00:39:34,510
is gonna have his second there, 

621
00:39:34,896 --> 00:39:35,471
that 

622
00:39:35,947 --> 00:39:37,783
sea-creature-looking cocksucker

623
00:39:38,598 --> 00:39:40,411
Hearst would have it understood the Captain 

624
00:39:40,715 --> 00:39:42,531
is just a hefty steward of the household

625
00:39:42,905 --> 00:39:45,090
Yeah, one with a dozen fuckin' pelts on his belt

626
00:39:45,397 --> 00:39:46,121
Even so, Dan,

627
00:39:47,546 --> 00:39:49,410
Hearst's man has pretext for his presence

628
00:39:50,065 --> 00:39:51,002
You and the others don't

629
00:39:52,817 --> 00:39:56,013
What with the olive branch I'll be bearing between my teeth

630
00:39:56,388 --> 00:39:57,290
You mind if we 

631
00:39:57,567 --> 00:39:58,471
watch you from the balcony?

632
00:39:58,767 --> 00:39:59,073
Not at all

633
00:39:59,335 --> 00:39:59,953
Moment seems meet,

634
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,033
blow me a kiss

635
00:40:02,828 --> 00:40:03,552
Excuse me

636
00:40:11,385 --> 00:40:12,982
If I could, I'd tear my skin off

637
00:40:16,385 --> 00:40:17,880
If I could, I'd put out my eyes

638
00:40:19,447 --> 00:40:20,261
No no

639
00:40:21,048 --> 00:40:22,092
I hate being sick

640
00:40:24,345 --> 00:40:24,891
Cy knew 

641
00:40:25,615 --> 00:40:26,292
what I was

642
00:40:27,315 --> 00:40:29,400
He knew to pick me all those years back

643
00:40:30,138 --> 00:40:30,780
Miss Stubbs,

644
00:40:32,618 --> 00:40:34,040
did you like my friend Bill Hickok?

645
00:40:35,478 --> 00:40:36,040
Oh, I

646
00:40:36,748 --> 00:40:38,590
I just met him the once at the Bella,

647
00:40:39,498 --> 00:40:41,033
that poker with Jack McCall

648
00:40:41,655 --> 00:40:43,163
Did you like Bill that night?

649
00:40:48,426 --> 00:40:49,702
I thought he was a gentleman

650
00:40:50,786 --> 00:40:51,182
He was

651
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:53,982
I felt he had a good soul

652
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:56,340
He did, Miss Stubbs

653
00:40:58,517 --> 00:41:00,443
I can say that. I knew him 20 years

654
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,050
You know what else?

655
00:41:02,678 --> 00:41:04,630
Bill that we both liked so well

656
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,913
and most everyone did that knew him,

657
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:08,542
incliding some he killed

658
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:14,700
Bill thought as ill of his own self as you seem to do about you

659
00:41:15,296 --> 00:41:17,612
So go on and try explaining people to me

660
00:41:18,445 --> 00:41:19,060
And 

661
00:41:19,356 --> 00:41:21,970
same as hearing me say what Bill thought of his self 

662
00:41:22,315 --> 00:41:24,281
I don't expect brings you to think any less of him…

663
00:41:26,035 --> 00:41:26,482
maybe you, 

664
00:41:26,877 --> 00:41:27,592
Miss Stubbs, 

665
00:41:28,037 --> 00:41:29,232
oughtn't to stand judge 

666
00:41:29,826 --> 00:41:30,532
and jury 

667
00:41:31,036 --> 00:41:34,070
and every other job in courth on your own personal case

668
00:41:34,506 --> 00:41:34,981
Maybe, 

669
00:41:35,336 --> 00:41:35,651
coming to verdict, 

670
00:41:36,905 --> 00:41:37,351
credit 

671
00:41:37,715 --> 00:41:40,403
others' opinion of you like you do what you think of Bill…

672
00:41:42,887 --> 00:41:43,553
still

673
00:41:54,737 --> 00:41:57,070
So I'm gonna-I'm gonna just do some introductory remarks

674
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:58,622
I'll call you up on stage

675
00:41:59,156 --> 00:42:01,522
Say what you have to say and that's it

676
00:42:01,817 --> 00:42:02,261
Aw, shit

677
00:42:07,075 --> 00:42:07,690
Mr. Hearst

678
00:42:08,588 --> 00:42:10,561
Do you come to me placated, Mr. Swearengen?

679
00:42:11,048 --> 00:42:12,742
Never more so, not even as a tiny tot

680
00:42:13,177 --> 00:42:14,291
Let's hear the speeches together

681
00:42:14,895 --> 00:42:16,110
Show me your hole in the wall, 

682
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:18,780
which I find a useful advance

683
00:42:22,567 --> 00:42:23,533
De Tocqueville said,

684
00:42:24,487 --> 00:42:26,941
"When an opinion has taken root in a democracy 

685
00:42:27,327 --> 00:42:29,271
and established itself in the minds of the majority,

686
00:42:29,745 --> 00:42:31,761
it thereafter persists by itself." 

687
00:42:32,678 --> 00:42:33,041
Tonight 

688
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,132
let us plant 

689
00:42:35,467 --> 00:42:36,303
the seed

690
00:42:36,668 --> 00:42:37,640
of an opinion 

691
00:42:38,117 --> 00:42:38,913
to take root 

692
00:42:39,258 --> 00:42:40,032
and grow deep,

693
00:42:40,988 --> 00:42:42,650
that gathering to this end 

694
00:42:43,168 --> 00:42:43,942
choosing those 

695
00:42:44,296 --> 00:42:45,940
who will act in our name 

696
00:42:46,688 --> 00:42:47,570
is proper,

697
00:42:48,268 --> 00:42:49,561
so that in years to come, 

698
00:42:50,217 --> 00:42:52,653
among those who succeed us in this thoroughfare

699
00:42:53,717 --> 00:42:55,612
this idea will persist 

700
00:42:56,118 --> 00:42:57,832
and seem to them self-evident

701
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,753
Candidates for Mayor

702
00:43:01,165 --> 00:43:02,962
E.B. Farnum and Sol Star

703
00:43:03,555 --> 00:43:05,531
The incumbent will address us first

704
00:43:09,407 --> 00:43:10,261
Oh God

705
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:16,323
I give no long speech tonight

706
00:43:17,657 --> 00:43:19,191
You know me and my works

707
00:43:19,818 --> 00:43:23,442
Your bosom must swell with pride, Mr. Swearengen

708
00:43:24,137 --> 00:43:27,872
Swellings and saggings to the tit I lay at the exactions of time

709
00:43:29,505 --> 00:43:30,291
I mean 

710
00:43:30,598 --> 00:43:33,022
you worked to bring this evening about

711
00:43:33,705 --> 00:43:35,072
To labor without pleasure 

712
00:43:35,506 --> 00:43:37,583
makes us our destiny's slaves

713
00:43:38,508 --> 00:43:42,580
To work for crumbs or to keep from the lash says maybe a slave's what you are

714
00:43:44,135 --> 00:43:47,893
I'll not question those either who have faith in my rival,

715
00:43:49,325 --> 00:43:51,473
or make faith an issue of any sort

716
00:43:54,218 --> 00:43:55,622
We are long past 

717
00:43:56,225 --> 00:43:57,293
the time of the Pharaohs

718
00:43:57,596 --> 00:44:00,101
I cannot decree Mr Star make exodus

719
00:44:00,837 --> 00:44:02,720
Were you whipped, Mr. Swearengen?

720
00:44:04,486 --> 00:44:07,222
And does the lash snap still?

721
00:44:07,705 --> 00:44:10,561
Do you wait for the strike after all these years?

722
00:44:11,347 --> 00:44:12,082
Would the grip 

723
00:44:12,475 --> 00:44:14,240
have been the part you were versed with?

724
00:44:14,617 --> 00:44:17,011
I was born to neither power nor money

725
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,580
My father sold goods from a 

726
00:44:19,898 --> 00:44:21,402
countryside crossroads hut

727
00:44:22,206 --> 00:44:24,232
A clear choice for Deadwood!

728
00:44:25,547 --> 00:44:26,070
Farnum

729
00:44:26,457 --> 00:44:27,171
twice measured

730
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:28,563
Star

731
00:44:28,845 --> 00:44:29,623
once cut

732
00:44:32,655 --> 00:44:33,412
E.B. Farnum! 

733
00:44:34,897 --> 00:44:36,511
Assayed and proven true!

734
00:44:39,846 --> 00:44:40,232
Farnum! 

735
00:44:41,126 --> 00:44:42,992
Christ knows he's earned it!

736
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,213
Mr. Star!

737
00:44:53,426 --> 00:44:55,062
When last we spoke,

738
00:44:55,765 --> 00:44:57,790
you warranted your willingness to 

739
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,102
interfere with me

740
00:45:00,437 --> 00:45:02,911
Only to convey that my place should be for my uses

741
00:45:03,605 --> 00:45:04,952
I won't need a miracle 

742
00:45:05,408 --> 00:45:07,900
far as parting the creek to take my leave of the camp

743
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,163
I just bought a house and plan to live here 

744
00:45:10,548 --> 00:45:11,511
as long as God gives me

745
00:45:11,877 --> 00:45:15,031
And my intention in making my sacrifice to you today

746
00:45:16,045 --> 00:45:18,660
and it seems, my life's great challenge

747
00:45:19,576 --> 00:45:22,581
was to show the virtue of consolidating purposes

748
00:45:22,896 --> 00:45:24,492
Keep people from shitting in the creek!

749
00:45:24,765 --> 00:45:25,893
That

750
00:45:26,737 --> 00:45:28,743
siftings runoff, tailings accumulating

751
00:45:29,286 --> 00:45:31,501
I'd say that's naming horseshit 

752
00:45:31,907 --> 00:45:32,493
virtue

753
00:45:33,156 --> 00:45:35,280
Purposes butt up against each other,

754
00:45:35,647 --> 00:45:36,732
and the strong call 

755
00:45:37,288 --> 00:45:38,183
"consolidating" 

756
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,411
bending the weak to their will

757
00:45:43,176 --> 00:45:43,890
And I'd add 

758
00:45:44,488 --> 00:45:45,562
whoever's behind me 

759
00:45:46,008 --> 00:45:47,733
is about to study his guts

760
00:45:48,198 --> 00:45:49,092
That's Captain Turner 

761
00:45:49,457 --> 00:45:50,763
at three steps' remove 

762
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:52,502
as he has heard about 

763
00:45:52,805 --> 00:45:54,720
your knifework close in

764
00:45:56,437 --> 00:45:58,243
No lowered pants in the whitewood!

765
00:45:58,646 --> 00:46:00,382
That's enough about the shit in the creek

766
00:46:00,918 --> 00:46:04,403
Away from your seconds' view, the Captain's pistol is trained at your head

767
00:46:05,227 --> 00:46:07,433
Do you believe yourself enough and adept, 

768
00:46:08,006 --> 00:46:10,342
Mr. Swearengen, to overcome your disadvantage 

769
00:46:10,948 --> 00:46:12,762
or will you walk with us inside?

770
00:46:17,667 --> 00:46:22,111
Not throwing my hands up or my skirt over my head don't mean I ain't awestruck

771
00:46:23,636 --> 00:46:24,890
Well, they ain't slobbering on each other,

772
00:46:25,268 --> 00:46:26,332
but they ain't snarling neither

773
00:46:27,225 --> 00:46:29,060
Needs to do with the camp, or problems, 

774
00:46:29,515 --> 00:46:31,071
you can always find me at the hardware store

775
00:46:40,616 --> 00:46:42,461
Seth Bullock for Sheriff!

776
00:46:53,258 --> 00:46:55,011
I agree with what Mr. Star says

777
00:46:55,807 --> 00:46:56,893
I find I usually do

778
00:46:58,576 --> 00:46:59,271
I'm lucky 

779
00:47:00,056 --> 00:47:01,463
we've been partnered these years

780
00:47:01,765 --> 00:47:03,142
Keeps giving me time to catch up

781
00:47:03,965 --> 00:47:05,401
I'm glad he's standing for office,

782
00:47:05,817 --> 00:47:07,851
and I'd try to be as good a Sheriff…

783
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:11,113
as he'd be a Mayor to the camp

784
00:47:12,526 --> 00:47:13,500
Sol's buying a house

785
00:47:14,778 --> 00:47:15,602
I built one 

786
00:47:16,746 --> 00:47:17,530
last year

787
00:47:20,807 --> 00:47:21,422
I'm glad 

788
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:23,881
we're in the camp…

789
00:47:26,158 --> 00:47:28,180
even on the sorriest of days

790
00:47:36,415 --> 00:47:37,981
Harry Manning for Sheriff

791
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:53,223
Accepting your premise, Mr. Swearengen,

792
00:47:53,695 --> 00:47:55,403
I'll not name how you would benefit 

793
00:47:55,827 --> 00:47:57,063
from the action I wish you to take, 

794
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,542
saying only instead it's my will

795
00:47:59,978 --> 00:48:01,582
To which I will have you bend, 

796
00:48:01,925 --> 00:48:03,592
I suggest you drink that... 

797
00:48:04,937 --> 00:48:05,443
No

798
00:48:06,565 --> 00:48:08,671
I would incorporate into my holdings

799
00:48:09,066 --> 00:48:10,892
the claim now owned by Mrs. Ellsworth

800
00:48:11,197 --> 00:48:13,002
I am told that you can help me bring this about

801
00:48:18,135 --> 00:48:19,073
Tell me how 

802
00:48:19,416 --> 00:48:20,190
you will help

803
00:48:21,807 --> 00:48:23,422
This is a grip I'm used to

804
00:48:31,356 --> 00:48:33,093
As far as making your way into her…

805
00:48:34,685 --> 00:48:36,723
act averse to nasty language 

806
00:48:37,426 --> 00:48:39,543
and partial to fruity tea

807
00:48:51,576 --> 00:48:52,760
But I'd like to get known 

808
00:48:53,688 --> 00:48:55,092
far as wanting to help the camp

809
00:48:57,147 --> 00:48:58,651
We need a fire brigade,

810
00:49:00,358 --> 00:49:01,660
and I'd like to lead it

811
00:49:03,217 --> 00:49:04,370
I've always loved fires 

812
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:05,983
since..since I was a boy

813
00:49:08,126 --> 00:49:09,922
If you're wanting to drink, the Number Ten's serving

814
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:12,252
Oh, also

815
00:49:12,626 --> 00:49:13,041
also,

816
00:49:14,597 --> 00:49:16,181
 the graveyard needs moving

817
00:49:17,327 --> 00:49:18,161
That's it

818
00:49:20,167 --> 00:49:21,153
well, thank you all for coming

819
00:49:21,748 --> 00:49:23,303
please think about what you heard here tonight,

820
00:49:23,707 --> 00:49:25,181
and thank you again

821
00:49:40,418 --> 00:49:41,660
Nothing's over yet

822
00:49:58,746 --> 00:49:59,832
Doc'd be dour 

823
00:50:00,408 --> 00:50:01,061
at a christening,

824
00:50:01,617 --> 00:50:05,282
but Trixie says he wasn't scowling how he does, 

825
00:50:05,715 --> 00:50:07,743
or or shaking his jowls like a bulldog

826
00:50:10,638 --> 00:50:11,162
Thank you, Charlie

827
00:50:11,326 --> 00:50:11,783
All right

828
00:50:16,258 --> 00:50:16,842
Oh God

829
00:50:17,186 --> 00:50:19,280
That's the look he gets on his face when he's hurt

830
00:50:20,568 --> 00:50:22,693
That man appears worse hurt than I am

831
00:50:23,548 --> 00:50:24,542
Bless his heart

832
00:50:26,018 --> 00:50:26,613
What happened?

833
00:50:27,165 --> 00:50:27,991
We watched the speeches together

834
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:29,650
Yours was especially swell

835
00:50:30,047 --> 00:50:30,932
I need to lean on you,

836
00:50:31,307 --> 00:50:32,083
but don't you fuckin' look up

837
00:50:32,297 --> 00:50:33,273
Should I go up and get him?

838
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:34,220
Hey, boys!

839
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:37,992
What'd you think of the speeches, huh?

840
00:50:38,267 --> 00:50:39,182
I'll go get the cocksucker now

841
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:40,800
Stay the fuck away from him. Hmm?

842
00:50:41,448 --> 00:50:42,550
I'm having mine served cold

843
00:50:43,298 --> 00:50:44,852
First one to touch me I kill
