1
00:00:54,862 --> 00:00:57,092
You ever think about dying?

2
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,692
Yeah. You?

3
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:02,461
Yeah. Some.

4
00:01:03,304 --> 00:01:04,862
You think there's a heaven?

5
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:07,698
Yeah. Don't you?

6
00:01:08,476 --> 00:01:09,966
I don't know.

7
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,808
Yeah, maybe.

8
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:21,154
Can you believe there's a heaven
if you don't believe in hell?

9
00:01:25,093 --> 00:01:27,755
I guess you can believe what you want to.

10
00:02:34,862 --> 00:02:38,696
This ranch has been in my family
as long as anyone can remember.

11
00:02:41,302 --> 00:02:45,398
My granddaddy used to tell me
this was heaven on earth.

12
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:49,303
Just like his granddaddy used to tell him.

13
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,353
Everything's changed now since he died.

14
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,316
Appreciate you lighting them candles.

15
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,728
It wasn't me. It was the lady.

16
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,158
My mother?

17
00:03:14,335 --> 00:03:15,825
She was here?

18
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,010
She's left already?

19
00:03:32,453 --> 00:03:35,081
All I ever wanted was to live
out there like him...

20
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:37,450
...and work my own spread.

21
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:39,350
Can't imagine no betterlife.

22
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:45,891
I've come to find out Mama aims to sell it.

23
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:51,405
Says the oil company would pay
three times what it's worth.

24
00:03:56,677 --> 00:04:00,238
Mama lives in San Antonio now with her new husband.

25
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:05,609
She wants to be in the live theater.

26
00:04:09,323 --> 00:04:11,518
As your granddaddy's only child...

27
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,852
...your mother inherits outright.

28
00:04:14,662 --> 00:04:17,688
It's her property. She can do whatever she wants.

29
00:04:17,932 --> 00:04:19,263
I don't have any say-so?

30
00:04:20,768 --> 00:04:22,030
What about my father?

31
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,669
They're divorced.

32
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,197
You could talk to her.

33
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:28,999
You're a lawyer.

34
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,610
Well, I have talked to her.

35
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:36,773
It's a sorry piece of business, but, son...

36
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:40,253
...not everybody thinks life
on a cattle ranch in Texas...

37
00:04:40,454 --> 00:04:43,014
...is the second-best thing to going to heaven.

38
00:04:43,357 --> 00:04:45,518
She don't want to live out there, that's all.

39
00:04:46,627 --> 00:04:50,119
If it was a paying proposition,
that'd be one thing, but it ain't.

40
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,559
It could be.

41
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:53,557
I could run it.

42
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:56,169
It's his own damn fault.

43
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,439
Your father signed every
paper she set in front of him.

44
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,336
Never lifted a hand to save himself.

45
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,937
I begged him to get a lawyer.

46
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:06,044
Well....

47
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:08,238
I'm sorry to have no better news...

48
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:11,417
...but some things in this world can't be helped.

49
00:05:12,153 --> 00:05:14,246
I believe this is probably one of them.

50
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,059
She went back to San Antonio.

51
00:05:21,262 --> 00:05:22,661
Don't call her "she."

52
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:23,728
Mama.

53
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:26,728
I thought the world of that old man.

54
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:27,923
Yeah.

55
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:29,932
Don't go crying on me now.

56
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:31,405
I ain't.

57
00:05:31,606 --> 00:05:33,335
-Well, don't.
-I ain't.

58
00:05:36,677 --> 00:05:40,579
-What do you think I should do?
-I don't think there's much to do.

59
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:42,646
-Will you talk to her?
-I can't.

60
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,249
You could talk to her.

61
00:05:44,452 --> 00:05:46,511
Last conversation I had with her...

62
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:50,718
...was in San Diego, CA in 1942.

63
00:05:57,698 --> 00:05:59,359
It ain't her fault.

64
00:06:00,268 --> 00:06:02,600
I ain't the same as I once was.

65
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,100
Like to think I am...

66
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,866
...but I ain't.

67
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,239
You are inside.

68
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:15,644
Inside you are.

69
00:06:19,453 --> 00:06:23,719
It's hard to watch people you came
from waste away before your eyes.

70
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,457
When the land is gone too...

71
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:29,721
...there's nothing to stand on or stand for either.

72
00:06:30,498 --> 00:06:32,557
When do y'all have to be out?

73
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:35,228
Closing is the first of June.

74
00:06:35,736 --> 00:06:37,670
You could wait till then.

75
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:40,104
What for?

76
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,345
Down in Mexico...

77
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,110
...they got ranches so big...

78
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:54,513
...you can't ride from one end to the other in a week.

79
00:06:56,757 --> 00:07:00,625
It ain't all fenced in and sold off and played out.

80
00:07:00,828 --> 00:07:02,489
Not down there.

81
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:10,527
You think they can't use two more top hands?

82
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:16,273
Real cowboys, huh?

83
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,945
Just like the old-time waddies.

84
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,782
If I don't go, will you go anyways?

85
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,054
I'm already gone.

86
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:36,194
-Thank you for everything.
-Goodbye.

87
00:07:36,731 --> 00:07:38,824
May God go with you.

88
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:40,693
Be careful.

89
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:43,830
Is that you, bud?

90
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:45,665
I hope so.

91
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:47,272
-You ready?
-Yeah.

92
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:49,534
-They suspect anything?
-No.

93
00:07:49,744 --> 00:07:52,645
-Let's go.
-Hang on. Got to pile all this stuff.

94
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,644
-Yonder goes the light.
-Damn.

95
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,716
-Late for your own funeral.
-He could be getting milk.

96
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:00,878
He could just be loading a shotgun.

97
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:32,310
Shut up. Lacey, there's been somebody following us.

98
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,014
-Somebody on horseback?
-Yeah.

99
00:09:36,317 --> 00:09:37,306
Come on.

100
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,349
Some kid.

101
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:43,853
That's a hell of a horse.

102
00:09:45,192 --> 00:09:46,659
Ain't it, though?

103
00:09:58,873 --> 00:10:00,534
You hunting us?

104
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:03,334
-I ain't hunting you.
-Then how come you following us?

105
00:10:03,544 --> 00:10:06,945
I ain't. I'm going to Langtry.
I don't even know who you are.

106
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,378
-Where'd you get that horse?
-It's mine.

107
00:10:09,617 --> 00:10:11,278
-How old are you?
-Sixteen.

108
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,612
-Lying sack of shit!
-You don't know.

109
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,320
I know you ain't no goddamn sixteen.

110
00:10:16,524 --> 00:10:18,617
-What'd you do, run off?
-What if I did?

111
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,460
We could sell his horse in Mexico.

112
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,392
-You want to?
-I ain't digging no grave this time.

113
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:28,728
Your idea. I was the one that said
just leave him for the buzzards.

114
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:36,798
Call it.

115
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,167
Heads.

116
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,742
Damn.

117
00:10:41,582 --> 00:10:43,072
Let me have your rifle.

118
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,853
It ain't fair. You shot the last three.

119
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:51,523
You go on, then. You can owe me.

120
00:10:52,493 --> 00:10:55,053
Hold his horse. It might not be gun-broke.

121
00:10:57,097 --> 00:10:59,156
Y'all ain't never shot nobody.

122
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:02,164
You could be a good somebody to start with.

123
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:06,264
Y'all just funning. I knowed it all along.

124
00:11:06,507 --> 00:11:07,838
Who's hunting you?

125
00:11:08,742 --> 00:11:09,731
Nobody.

126
00:11:09,944 --> 00:11:12,208
They're hunting that horse, though, ain't they?

127
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,010
You ain't riding with us. Get us in the jailhouse.

128
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,275
He belongs to me.

129
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:21,079
Son, I don't give a shit who he belongs to.

130
00:11:21,288 --> 00:11:23,279
But he damn sure don't belong to you.

131
00:11:24,091 --> 00:11:25,422
Now, let's go, bud.

132
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:35,458
I thought he'd put up more of a argument.

133
00:11:36,537 --> 00:11:39,267
We ain't seen the last of his skinny ass.

134
00:12:21,982 --> 00:12:25,816
That's her, ain't it?
That's the goddamn Rio Grande.

135
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,513
Just think. Over yonder's Old Mexico.

136
00:12:33,093 --> 00:12:35,186
You reckon you want to cross now?

137
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,930
Yeah. You?

138
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:39,958
Yeah.

139
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,937
Maybe we'd better rest these horses up first.

140
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,772
All right.

141
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,813
Shit.

142
00:13:06,226 --> 00:13:09,195
I got a uneasy feeling about that son of a bitch.

143
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:11,020
I do too.

144
00:13:11,398 --> 00:13:13,730
He ain't as green as he looks, neither.

145
00:13:18,238 --> 00:13:20,866
There won't nobody be hunting me in Mexico.

146
00:13:21,075 --> 00:13:22,633
That depends on what you done.

147
00:13:23,477 --> 00:13:26,139
-What's your name?
-Jimmy Blevins.

148
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,881
You got any grub?

149
00:13:31,318 --> 00:13:32,376
No.

150
00:13:34,154 --> 00:13:35,712
You got any money?

151
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,414
No.

152
00:13:37,758 --> 00:13:39,419
You're just a deadhead.

153
00:13:42,896 --> 00:13:44,659
Just tell me one thing.

154
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,091
What the hell would we want you with us for?

155
00:13:50,671 --> 00:13:52,502
Because I'm a American.

156
00:14:59,673 --> 00:15:01,402
When did you eat last?

157
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:04,074
Other day.

158
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,644
Your name ain't Blivit, is it?

159
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,747
It's Blevins.

160
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,248
You know what a Blivit is?

161
00:15:12,753 --> 00:15:13,913
No. What?

162
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,646
Ten pounds of shit in a five-pound sack.

163
00:15:20,627 --> 00:15:22,754
Y'all ain't said y'all's names was.

164
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,824
I'm John Grady Cole. This here's Lacey Rawlins.

165
00:15:27,434 --> 00:15:30,335
We're from San Angelo. Where you from?

166
00:15:30,537 --> 00:15:33,597
Uvalde County. Near the Sabinal River.

167
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:36,507
What made you light out for Mexico?

168
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,270
Same reason as you.

169
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,270
What reason is that?

170
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:45,410
They'd go bowlegged
and blind finding your ass down here.

171
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:47,109
Ain't nobody hunting me.

172
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,682
I told that son of a bitch 
he wasn't whupping me again.

173
00:15:52,893 --> 00:15:54,884
-Your daddy?
-No.

174
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:57,096
My daddy never came back from the war.

175
00:15:57,297 --> 00:15:58,559
Your stepdaddy.

176
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:03,527
I know what it's like to get a beating.

177
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:08,938
You didn't shoot him?

178
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:11,474
I would've. And he knowed it too.

179
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,943
Suppose we trade that horse off
for one less likely get us shot.

180
00:16:18,151 --> 00:16:20,779
-I ain't trading horses.
-We ain't no wet nurses.

181
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:23,149
-I can take care of myself.
-Sure.

182
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,653
Hell, you're a regular old desperado, ain't you?

183
00:16:27,427 --> 00:16:29,588
I reckon you got your own gun and all.

184
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,024
Yeah, I got a gun.

185
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,323
What kind of a gun?

186
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,332
-32-20 Colt.
-Bullshit.

187
00:16:37,504 --> 00:16:39,472
That's a rifle cartridge.

188
00:16:39,673 --> 00:16:40,662
Let's see it.

189
00:16:54,688 --> 00:16:56,451
Where'd you get a gun like this?

190
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,021
At the getting place.

191
00:17:01,428 --> 00:17:03,259
-You ever shot it?
-Yeah, I shot it.

192
00:17:03,463 --> 00:17:05,624
-You hit anything?
-Anything you want.

193
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:07,197
Bullshit.

194
00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:10,528
All right, let's go, outlaw. Come on.

195
00:17:24,718 --> 00:17:26,379
You ready, Annie Oakley?

196
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,153
Waiting on you.

197
00:17:34,895 --> 00:17:36,385
Goddamn.

198
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:41,056
Let me see it.

199
00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:45,534
-Let me see it.
-We'd better get going.

200
00:17:45,739 --> 00:17:49,402
-Come on, give it to me.
-You know what my wallet looks like.

201
00:17:59,186 --> 00:18:00,676
Look at this shit.

202
00:18:24,878 --> 00:18:26,846
She got anything to drink?

203
00:18:30,784 --> 00:18:32,115
What is that?

204
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,088
-Cider.
-All right.

205
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:38,120
Let's have three of them.

206
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,392
How much is it?

207
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:46,891
It's like three cents.

208
00:18:47,134 --> 00:18:49,568
Oh, let your old dad buy it.

209
00:18:51,138 --> 00:18:53,800
He about dead-centered your pocketbook, didn't he?

210
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:58,872
I want you to look at my goddamn driver's license.

211
00:19:00,647 --> 00:19:02,512
And my pool hall card.

212
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:04,650
You won't need them down here.

213
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:06,751
Look at this shit.

214
00:19:07,054 --> 00:19:08,919
Shot Betty Ward between the eyes.

215
00:19:09,156 --> 00:19:10,987
What's she doing in there?

216
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,425
I didn't know you liked her.

217
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:23,095
What is this? Cactus juice?

218
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:24,667
I don't know.

219
00:19:25,105 --> 00:19:28,836
-Got a little kick to it, though.
-I think it does.

220
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:34,672
Pretty doggone good.

221
00:19:38,518 --> 00:19:40,418
Say it again. Say my name again.

222
00:19:45,025 --> 00:19:46,014
Golly!

223
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:49,195
What am I doing leaving
my hat on the bed? It's not much.

224
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,728
You can't have no more cider.

225
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:13,943
Shit.

226
00:20:21,795 --> 00:20:23,786
I'm drunker than shit.

227
00:20:23,997 --> 00:20:25,692
Can you ride or not?

228
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:27,560
Hell, yeah, I can ride.

229
00:20:28,235 --> 00:20:30,226
I was riding when I fell off.

230
00:20:31,505 --> 00:20:33,939
I'm a regular buckaroo.

231
00:20:36,176 --> 00:20:38,804
Certified damn bronc peeler.

232
00:20:44,518 --> 00:20:46,076
Just leave him lay there.

233
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:49,881
Get on and quit assing around.
It's fixing to come a good one.

234
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,352
Come on.

235
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:53,986
I can't be out in this.

236
00:20:54,194 --> 00:20:56,754
-Where do you think you'll go?
-Why can't you?

237
00:20:56,963 --> 00:20:58,555
On account of the lightning.

238
00:20:58,765 --> 00:21:01,598
Damn if you don't look sober all of a sudden.

239
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,828
-Are you afraid of lightning?
-It runs in the family.

240
00:21:05,205 --> 00:21:08,800
My grandpa, he was killed
in West Virginia in a mine bucket.

241
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:11,773
It run all the way down the hole
to get him, 180 feet.

242
00:21:12,612 --> 00:21:14,671
A great-uncle on my mother's side...

243
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:19,818
...was killed off a horse. 
Horse's hair wasn't singed, but it killed him.

244
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,352
I got a cousin not 4 year older than me.

245
00:21:22,556 --> 00:21:24,956
He was struck by lightning 
coming back from his barn.

246
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:28,218
Melted the fillings in his teeth
and soldered his jaw shut.

247
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:30,827
He's gone completely dipshit.

248
00:21:31,998 --> 00:21:34,398
I done been struck twice myself.

249
00:21:35,135 --> 00:21:37,399
How come me be deaf in this one ear.

250
00:21:37,637 --> 00:21:39,969
I'm born to death by fire, man.

251
00:21:41,074 --> 00:21:45,204
You'd better get away from all metal.
You don't know what it'd get you.

252
00:21:45,412 --> 00:21:47,778
Your boot spurs, shirt buttons....

253
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:49,608
What do you intend to do?

254
00:21:49,816 --> 00:21:51,078
Outride it.

255
00:21:51,885 --> 00:21:55,446
You can't outride a thunderstorm.
What the hell is wrong with you?

256
00:21:55,655 --> 00:21:57,247
It's the only chance I got.

257
00:22:01,061 --> 00:22:04,895
I knowed it from the first time that
son of a bitch had a loose nut.

258
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,446
What the hell are you doing?!

259
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,247
Just sitting here.

260
00:22:23,683 --> 00:22:28,620
If this rain hits hard, there'll be
a river come down like a train.

261
00:22:28,855 --> 00:22:30,186
You thought about that?

262
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:34,190
You've never been struck by lightning.
You don't know what it's like.

263
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,521
You'll drown sitting there.

264
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,030
That's all right. I ain't never been drowned before.

265
00:22:45,205 --> 00:22:46,263
Well...

266
00:22:47,207 --> 00:22:48,299
...I'll say no more.

267
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,161
Your horse is gone.

268
00:23:15,001 --> 00:23:19,335
Yeah, I know. I done been on foot
looking around this morning.

269
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,901
Where'd you find that boot?

270
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:23,974
On the ground.

271
00:23:28,915 --> 00:23:30,815
Well, what do you aim to do?

272
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,983
I don't know.

273
00:23:38,325 --> 00:23:40,759
Let's get your ass up out of there.

274
00:23:47,701 --> 00:23:51,159
Got a spare shirt in my saddlebag.
You put that on.

275
00:23:51,705 --> 00:23:52,694
Appreciate it.

276
00:23:52,939 --> 00:23:55,806
Rawlins will pitch a pure hissy when he sees you.

277
00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:57,271
I don't give a shit.

278
00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:00,942
There's my damn pistol.

279
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:02,444
-Shit.
-Hold on.

280
00:24:05,185 --> 00:24:07,551
Keep riding. Good God almighty.

281
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,395
I ain't leaving until I get my stuff.

282
00:24:22,602 --> 00:24:24,661
-My gun too.
-Listen at that.

283
00:24:24,871 --> 00:24:28,034
Get us all shot for horse-stealing don't mean a thing.

284
00:24:28,274 --> 00:24:30,902
-It ain't stealing. It's mine.
-Shit-for-brains!

285
00:24:31,111 --> 00:24:32,510
Hush. Both of you.

286
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,543
Get over here and sit down.

287
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,390
We're going to stick here...

288
00:24:49,129 --> 00:24:51,461
...till about a hour before daylight.

289
00:24:54,234 --> 00:24:57,135
Now, you got to play this exactly like we say.

290
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,368
If that don't satisfy, then you tell us right now.

291
00:25:02,575 --> 00:25:04,304
Yeah. Okay.

292
00:25:05,812 --> 00:25:06,836
All right.

293
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,481
You go on and get some sleep.

294
00:25:14,187 --> 00:25:15,984
And no fire tonight.

295
00:25:22,328 --> 00:25:25,195
Every dumb thing I ever done in my life...

296
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:29,397
...a decision I made before that got me into it.

297
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,663
It was never the dumb thing.

298
00:25:33,506 --> 00:25:37,237
It was always some choice I'd
made first. You understand?

299
00:25:37,944 --> 00:25:39,343
Yeah, I think so.

300
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,846
Meaning what?

301
00:25:42,048 --> 00:25:43,845
Meaning this is it.

302
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:48,452
This is our last chance. Won't be
no other time, I guarantee it.

303
00:25:48,688 --> 00:25:50,747
-Meaning just leave him?
-Yes, sir.

304
00:25:52,058 --> 00:25:53,286
What if it was you?

305
00:25:53,526 --> 00:25:55,960
I wouldn't leave you, or you me.

306
00:25:56,196 --> 00:25:57,754
You realize the fix he's in?

307
00:25:58,298 --> 00:26:02,200
I realize it. It's the fix he's put himself in.

308
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:13,143
I can't do it.

309
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,940
Well, if you can't, you can't.

310
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,483
I guess I knew what you'd say anyways.

311
00:26:28,228 --> 00:26:29,388
Oh, no. Damn it.

312
00:26:31,064 --> 00:26:32,622
That little son of a bitch.

313
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:20,508
Hold up, hold up. Let's listen.

314
00:27:20,713 --> 00:27:22,943
You little son of a bitch.

315
00:27:24,784 --> 00:27:27,753
-Boys, they're coming.
-Cars or horses?

316
00:27:27,954 --> 00:27:30,821
Horses. And there ain't no way y'all can keep up.

317
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:34,755
I'll take the road. They'll follow
the dust, since they're hunting me.

318
00:27:34,961 --> 00:27:37,930
Get in the woods. I'll see y'all down the road.

319
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:40,531
Let's get off this damn road.

320
00:27:55,648 --> 00:27:57,172
You think they caught him?

321
00:27:58,151 --> 00:27:59,413
I don't know.

322
00:28:06,993 --> 00:28:09,655
I'll say one thing for him anyways.

323
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,325
What's that?

324
00:28:11,931 --> 00:28:15,992
Son of a bitch wouldn't stand still
for nobody hijacking his horse.

325
00:28:19,272 --> 00:28:20,864
You got your boots on?

326
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,167
-Yeah.
-All right.

327
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:54,805
You reckon they're friendly?

328
00:28:57,143 --> 00:28:59,134
Shoot, I hope so.

329
00:29:11,257 --> 00:29:12,884
Where are you going?

330
00:29:13,726 --> 00:29:15,387
We're just passing through.

331
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,627
We're looking for work.

332
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:23,765
Oh, yeah?

333
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,097
We might have some work for you.

334
00:29:27,674 --> 00:29:29,005
He said maybe.

335
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,803
Can we come with you?

336
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,404
Yes, of course.

337
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,510
Good.

338
00:29:40,787 --> 00:29:41,776
Go that way.

339
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:43,652
Over there?

340
00:30:34,307 --> 00:30:36,502
Did you see that little darling?

341
00:30:48,254 --> 00:30:50,085
Watch it. Bring him over here.

342
00:30:50,423 --> 00:30:51,720
Get in there.

343
00:31:18,951 --> 00:31:21,579
How long you reckon you'd like to stay here?

344
00:31:21,788 --> 00:31:23,756
About a hundred years.

345
00:31:25,191 --> 00:31:26,886
Now go to sleep.

346
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:54,378
There's Don Hector Rocha y Villareal.

347
00:31:55,154 --> 00:31:56,917
Owns this whole shebang.

348
00:31:58,257 --> 00:32:00,282
One of the last great ranches in Mexico.

349
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,786
27,000 acres.

350
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:08,123
Flies his own plane to Mexico City every week.

351
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:14,165
Manuel said this ranch been in this family 170 years.

352
00:32:21,113 --> 00:32:23,308
You reckon that was his daughter?

353
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:25,577
Yeah, I guess it was.

354
00:32:56,215 --> 00:32:58,206
Let me go get my boots on.

355
00:32:58,718 --> 00:33:01,619
Looks like there's about 12 or 13 of them.

356
00:33:01,821 --> 00:33:03,015
I make it 16.

357
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:11,058
Armando said the old man's got
like 400 mustangs up on that mesa.

358
00:33:11,297 --> 00:33:12,389
Damn.

359
00:33:16,235 --> 00:33:19,466
You think you and me can break
all of them in four days?

360
00:33:24,243 --> 00:33:27,178
-Why four days?
-You think we could do it?

361
00:33:29,482 --> 00:33:32,474
You'd be about a wore-out sumbuck,
I'll tell you that.

362
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:38,356
I'll have a look at them. Go talk to Armando.

363
00:33:43,462 --> 00:33:44,895
How you doing?

364
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,596
I'm all right.

365
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:52,894
If we mess this up, bud, 
it's gonna be a long ride back to Texas.

366
00:34:13,292 --> 00:34:14,350
Give it some slack.

367
00:34:18,864 --> 00:34:19,694
That's it.

368
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,661
That's it. Whoa, boy.

369
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,823
I'll put a saddle on you right now.

370
00:37:38,063 --> 00:37:39,291
Your jackets.

371
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:08,526
You tired?

372
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:21,066
The horse is arriving, get ready.

373
00:38:21,273 --> 00:38:22,672
Don't delay!

374
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,511
Hector de la Rocha y Villareal.

375
00:38:32,718 --> 00:38:33,844
John Grady Cole.

376
00:38:34,053 --> 00:38:35,350
Glad to meet you.

377
00:38:36,956 --> 00:38:39,789
Alfonsa, you look like an Impressionist painting.

378
00:38:43,395 --> 00:38:46,023
Armando says you know a lot about horses.

379
00:38:46,232 --> 00:38:48,132
I've been around them some.

380
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,029
Do you know what a Criollo is?

381
00:38:52,137 --> 00:38:55,197
Yes, sir. It's a Argentine horse.

382
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,067
You're from Texas?

383
00:38:59,278 --> 00:39:00,540
Yes, Sir.

384
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,804
San Angelo.

385
00:39:04,984 --> 00:39:06,474
Why are you here?

386
00:39:08,254 --> 00:39:12,156
I just wanted to see the country, 
I reckon. Or we did.

387
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,549
-You and your friend.
-Yes, sir.

388
00:39:15,628 --> 00:39:17,220
But you are the leader.

389
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:21,055
We don't have no leaders. No, we're just buddies.

390
00:39:21,634 --> 00:39:22,965
Of course.

391
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:31,399
I recently purchased a thoroughbred
stallion of excellent blood.

392
00:39:31,977 --> 00:39:36,073
-You gonna raise racehorses?
-No. Quarter horses.

393
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:40,416
I'm thinking of breeding my stallion
with my Mesteno mares.

394
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,244
What's your opinion on that?

395
00:39:44,823 --> 00:39:46,688
Well, I've known it done.

396
00:39:47,326 --> 00:39:50,124
There's been good cow horses
sired out of thoroughbreds.

397
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:52,320
Of what importance is the mare?

398
00:39:52,531 --> 00:39:55,796
Same as the sire. In my opinion.

399
00:39:56,001 --> 00:39:58,799
Most breeders place more confidence in the stallion.

400
00:39:59,004 --> 00:40:00,198
Yes, Sir, they do.

401
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,005
But I agree with you.

402
00:40:10,382 --> 00:40:13,112
And you rode all the way here from Texas?

403
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,847
Yes, Sir.

404
00:40:15,054 --> 00:40:17,215
-You and your friend?
-Yes, sir.

405
00:40:18,023 --> 00:40:19,786
Just the two of you.

406
00:40:20,693 --> 00:40:21,887
Yes, Sir.

407
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,355
Just me and him.

408
00:40:35,874 --> 00:40:39,970
Well, Mr. Cole, would you like to see some horses?

409
00:40:41,046 --> 00:40:41,876
Yes, Sir.

410
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:46,213
It ain't like you was going away.

411
00:40:46,418 --> 00:40:49,012
No. We'd still be working together.

412
00:40:53,592 --> 00:40:55,890
It's a good opportunity for you.

413
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,193
Hell, I'd do it.

414
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,515
They told me to come bunk in here.

415
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:30,083
I was going to put my horse
in one of these stalls.

416
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:34,725
Can I put my horse in this stall?

417
00:41:41,273 --> 00:41:43,366
Well, I guess we can talk later.

418
00:42:35,294 --> 00:42:36,522
That's your mare.

419
00:42:37,496 --> 00:42:38,827
Look at the eye on her.

420
00:42:39,031 --> 00:42:40,498
Bring this one here.

421
00:42:45,471 --> 00:42:48,634
She's not as big as the other one,
but that's your mare.

422
00:42:48,841 --> 00:42:50,570
Do you like this one?

423
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:51,800
She's a beauty.

424
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,891
Some of them got their hats on.

425
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:02,046
I figure you just must be ready to cry
yourself to sleep every night.

426
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:06,610
She's probably used to dating guys got
their own airplanes, let alone cars.

427
00:44:07,352 --> 00:44:08,444
You're probably right.

428
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,746
I'm glad to hear you say it.

429
00:44:10,956 --> 00:44:13,083
It don't change nothing though.

430
00:44:32,244 --> 00:44:34,235
My name's John Grady Cole.

431
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:36,377
My name is Alejandra.

432
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,210
I know.

433
00:44:42,254 --> 00:44:44,119
I hoped that you would come.

434
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,995
I come because I thought you'd be here.

435
00:44:52,664 --> 00:44:53,892
I know.

436
00:45:15,954 --> 00:45:19,253
My granddaddy lived his whole life on that ranch.

437
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:21,850
Seventy-four years.

438
00:45:22,661 --> 00:45:25,459
Seem there could hardly be one without the other.

439
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,196
I guess...

440
00:45:30,702 --> 00:45:34,103
...the country lasts forever,
and people ain't but for a while.

441
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,509
And how will you live now?

442
00:45:40,445 --> 00:45:42,037
Where will your home be?

443
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,127
What's wrong?

444
00:46:12,577 --> 00:46:14,306
I dreamed about you last night.

445
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:19,374
What did you dream about?

446
00:46:19,885 --> 00:46:21,648
Someday I may tell you.

447
00:46:22,554 --> 00:46:24,021
But not tonight.

448
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,897
Do I have something in my nose?

449
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:42,772
No. I have something in my nose.

450
00:46:57,122 --> 00:46:58,384
Do you like him?

451
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:00,023
A hell of a horse.

452
00:47:19,244 --> 00:47:20,871
I want to ride him.

453
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,438
What?

454
00:47:23,548 --> 00:47:25,243
I want to ride him.

455
00:47:26,485 --> 00:47:27,577
When?

456
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,111
Now.

457
00:47:29,921 --> 00:47:32,287
-I want to now.
-He don't have a saddle.

458
00:47:32,491 --> 00:47:33,480
I know.

459
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:41,230
I don't think the patron would want me
to give him to you without a saddle.

460
00:47:43,568 --> 00:47:45,160
Your father.

461
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:52,499
Get down.

462
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,678
-Are you sure about this?
-Yes!

463
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,236
Hurry.

464
00:48:01,653 --> 00:48:04,816
Well, what do you aim to do
with your horse?

465
00:48:05,023 --> 00:48:07,423
I want you to take him back to the barn.

466
00:48:08,827 --> 00:48:10,488
Somebody's going to see me.

467
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,449
Fixing to get me in trouble.

468
00:48:38,824 --> 00:48:40,655
You are in trouble.

469
00:49:13,892 --> 00:49:16,452
I am Senorita Alfonsa.

470
00:49:17,963 --> 00:49:19,897
I'm John Grady Cole.

471
00:49:22,434 --> 00:49:24,561
I'm happy that you have come.

472
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:38,780
Alejandra will be in Mexico City
with her mother for two weeks.

473
00:49:38,984 --> 00:49:41,418
Then she'll be here for the summer.

474
00:49:43,288 --> 00:49:47,281
Alejandra and I disagree strongly.

475
00:49:48,093 --> 00:49:49,424
In fact, I....

476
00:49:49,928 --> 00:49:53,489
She's so much like me at that age that I....

477
00:49:53,698 --> 00:49:58,362
I seem at times to be struggling
with my own past self.

478
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:05,268
So you see, I cannot help but be
sympathetic to Alejandra.

479
00:50:06,511 --> 00:50:08,979
But I won't have her unhappy.

480
00:50:09,781 --> 00:50:13,239
I won't have her spoken ill of...

481
00:50:13,451 --> 00:50:15,442
...or gossiped about.

482
00:50:16,021 --> 00:50:18,114
I know what that is.

483
00:50:18,723 --> 00:50:22,181
It is not proper for you to be seen
riding in campo together...

484
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,362
...without supervision.

485
00:50:26,798 --> 00:50:30,962
I considered whether to speak
to my niece about it, but I...

486
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:34,370
I've decided not.

487
00:50:36,007 --> 00:50:37,531
What do you want me to do?

488
00:50:37,809 --> 00:50:41,472
I want you to be considerate
of a young girl's reputation.

489
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,204
I never meant not to be.

490
00:50:43,481 --> 00:50:45,005
I believe you.

491
00:50:45,517 --> 00:50:46,848
But you see...

492
00:50:48,386 --> 00:50:51,822
...this is another country.

493
00:50:52,724 --> 00:50:58,060
Here, a woman's reputation is all she has.

494
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,493
There's no forgiveness...

495
00:51:00,832 --> 00:51:02,163
...for women.

496
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:07,732
A man may lose his honor and regain
it again, but a woman cannot.

497
00:51:08,707 --> 00:51:12,734
I guess I'd have to say that don't seem right.

498
00:51:13,211 --> 00:51:16,772
It's not a matter of right.

499
00:51:18,383 --> 00:51:21,375
It's a matter of who must say.

500
00:51:21,586 --> 00:51:25,716
And in this matter, I get to say.

501
00:51:55,253 --> 00:51:56,618
What is it?

502
00:52:02,293 --> 00:52:04,318
You're going to wake Esteban.

503
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:06,822
Then invite me in.

504
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:18,303
What did she say to you? My aunt?

505
00:52:18,643 --> 00:52:20,907
You want to sit down?

506
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,069
Go on.

507
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:29,915
What did she say to you?

508
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,321
Didn't she tell you what she said?

509
00:52:34,592 --> 00:52:36,287
Of course she did.

510
00:52:37,595 --> 00:52:38,857
What did she say?

511
00:52:40,799 --> 00:52:46,101
She said she didn't want me being seen
with you in the campo.

512
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,107
And you agreed?

513
00:52:52,677 --> 00:52:54,941
-You are afraid of her.
-No.

514
00:52:57,315 --> 00:52:59,340
Just like everyone else.

515
00:53:01,286 --> 00:53:02,878
It ain't like that.

516
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,451
I hate the way she treats me.

517
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:14,495
I thought you were my friend.

518
00:53:24,676 --> 00:53:27,474
You tell me what you want me to do.

519
00:53:29,881 --> 00:53:31,849
I'll do anything you say.

520
00:55:11,082 --> 00:55:12,640
How's it going, Esteban?

521
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,914
See you after a while.

522
00:55:34,839 --> 00:55:36,500
I know the old man likes you...

523
00:55:36,774 --> 00:55:39,937
...that don't mean he'll sit
for you courting his daughter.

524
00:55:40,612 --> 00:55:41,909
Yeah, I know.

525
00:55:42,113 --> 00:55:44,877
Well, I don't see you holding no aces, bud.

526
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:52,618
I see you fixing to get us fired 
and throwed off this place.

527
00:55:57,862 --> 00:55:59,227
Take it easy, bud.

528
00:56:34,098 --> 00:56:34,232
Get up!

529
00:56:34,232 --> 00:56:35,324
Get up!

530
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,177
What's this all about?

531
00:56:48,379 --> 00:56:49,368
No talking!

532
00:56:50,415 --> 00:56:51,677
Yes, but I don't understand--

533
00:56:51,883 --> 00:56:53,077
You understand "shut up"?

534
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:55,377
Let's go.

535
00:57:24,115 --> 00:57:26,743
I ain't above whipping your ass, you know.

536
00:57:27,885 --> 00:57:30,547
Don't you think if we're gonna get out of this...

537
00:57:30,755 --> 00:57:34,054
...we might think about how to get out of it together?

538
00:57:34,726 --> 00:57:36,557
Like the way we got in it?

539
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,660
You think it was Rocha?

540
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:43,660
You think he sold us down the river?

541
00:57:44,569 --> 00:57:47,629
I tried to reason with you. Tried many times.

542
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,101
I know.

543
00:57:51,075 --> 00:57:53,168
Some things ain't reasonable.

544
00:58:00,284 --> 00:58:03,253
Look, I'm the same man you crossed that river with.

545
00:58:05,089 --> 00:58:07,353
How I was is how I am.

546
00:58:07,592 --> 00:58:09,924
And all I know to do is stick.

547
00:58:18,336 --> 00:58:21,828
I don't believe in signing on
just till it quit suiting you.

548
00:58:23,674 --> 00:58:25,835
You either stick or you quit.

549
00:58:26,444 --> 00:58:29,140
I wouldn't quit you. I don't care what you done.

550
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:33,441
That's about all I got to say.

551
00:58:41,459 --> 00:58:43,154
I never quit you.

552
00:58:43,694 --> 00:58:44,991
All right.

553
00:58:54,305 --> 00:58:55,636
Hey, y'all.

554
00:58:57,141 --> 00:58:59,371
Oh, God help me.

555
00:59:04,115 --> 00:59:05,548
How long you been in here?

556
00:59:06,717 --> 00:59:07,877
I don't know.

557
00:59:08,386 --> 00:59:09,614
A long time.

558
00:59:10,054 --> 00:59:12,921
-At least a month.
-You told them to hunt us?

559
00:59:13,157 --> 00:59:14,920
No, I wouldn't do nothing like it.

560
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:16,490
Bullshit.

561
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:20,420
They wouldn't hunt us if they got
that horse back. He done something.

562
00:59:20,665 --> 00:59:22,565
It was my damn horse. My gun too.

563
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,735
-What did you do?
-Nothing nobody else wouldn't.

564
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,098
Did you come back here?

565
00:59:28,573 --> 00:59:30,268
You're damn right I did.

566
00:59:30,575 --> 00:59:32,543
Oh, Jesus, oh, God.

567
00:59:32,743 --> 00:59:33,835
What did you do?

568
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:41,216
What are they accusing him of?

569
00:59:41,419 --> 00:59:42,784
Murder.

570
00:59:43,855 --> 00:59:45,755
He killed a man?

571
00:59:46,157 --> 00:59:47,317
Three.

572
00:59:47,592 --> 00:59:49,287
Said he killed three men.

573
00:59:49,494 --> 00:59:51,462
That's a damn lie.

574
00:59:53,164 --> 00:59:54,927
Don't step in the bucket.

575
00:59:55,766 --> 00:59:57,358
We're dead.

576
00:59:58,169 --> 00:59:59,966
We're dead men.

577
01:00:00,171 --> 01:00:02,901
I knew it'd come to this from the first moment--

578
01:00:03,107 --> 01:00:04,665
Don't start. That won't help.

579
01:00:04,942 --> 01:00:06,341
Ain't but one of them died.

580
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,236
Tell me what happened.

581
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,446
Well, I got me a job on this farm.

582
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:14,750
Saved me up some money.

583
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,816
Then I rode back here to get my pistol.

584
01:00:20,925 --> 01:00:25,385
I seen it sticking in the son of a
bitch's belt, so I just grabbed it.

585
01:00:25,596 --> 01:00:26,585
And shot him.

586
01:00:26,964 --> 01:00:28,989
He come at me. What choice did I have?

587
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,258
What choice--?

588
01:00:30,468 --> 01:00:33,926
By the time I got back to the spring
where my horse was...

589
01:00:34,138 --> 01:00:36,470
...they caught back up with me.

590
01:00:38,209 --> 01:00:40,677
And the old boy, I shot off his horse.

591
01:00:41,612 --> 01:00:43,603
He throwed down on me with a shotgun.

592
01:00:44,115 --> 01:00:46,606
A rurales? Did you shoot a rurales?

593
01:00:48,286 --> 01:00:49,184
Yeah.

594
01:00:49,387 --> 01:00:50,376
Dead?

595
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:52,781
Yeah.

596
01:00:57,962 --> 01:01:00,226
What do you think they mean to do?

597
01:01:00,965 --> 01:01:02,830
Send me to the penitentiary.

598
01:01:03,067 --> 01:01:04,261
You won't be that lucky.

599
01:01:04,468 --> 01:01:06,265
Well, I'm too young to hang.

600
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:08,199
They'll lie about your age.

601
01:01:08,406 --> 01:01:10,636
There's no capital punishment here.

602
01:01:10,841 --> 01:01:14,333
-You knew they'd hunt us.
-Was I supposed to send a telegram?

603
01:01:17,148 --> 01:01:20,208
-What happened to your feet?
-They busted them.

604
01:01:20,418 --> 01:01:22,318
They didn't give you no bandages?

605
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:24,885
No.

606
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:33,854
Oh, shit.

607
01:02:27,652 --> 01:02:30,780
Tell them whatever they want to hear.
It won't matter.

608
01:02:30,988 --> 01:02:32,046
What did you say?

609
01:02:32,256 --> 01:02:36,556
Told them we was murderers
and horse thieves. You will too.

610
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:40,222
Your friend told us everything.

611
01:02:41,766 --> 01:02:44,929
Better that you do the same to avoid some trouble.

612
01:02:45,736 --> 01:02:48,261
You had no right to beat up on that boy.

613
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:53,006
We know nothing about Blevins. 
He asked to ride with us.

614
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,635
We know nothing about that horse.

615
01:02:55,913 --> 01:02:58,780
It got away from him in the storm
and showed up here.

616
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:00,848
That's when the trouble started.

617
01:03:04,355 --> 01:03:08,519
We been working for Senor Rocha going
on three months down at La Purisima.

618
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:11,587
You went down there and told him lies.

619
01:03:12,263 --> 01:03:15,528
Rawlins is as good a boy as ever
come out of Tom Green County.

620
01:03:16,767 --> 01:03:18,667
Is that the criminal, Smith?

621
01:03:19,437 --> 01:03:24,033
His name is Rawlins. He ain't
a criminal. I grew up with him.

622
01:03:24,275 --> 01:03:27,642
The assassin Blevins, he did not have any documents.

623
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:30,313
-He lost his clothes.
-He lost his clothes?

624
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:37,514
He has no feathers.

625
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:41,622
-He what?
-He has no feathers.

626
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:46,955
I wouldn't know anything about that.

627
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:54,631
That don't interest me.

628
01:03:57,141 --> 01:03:59,507
Why does he come here and steal horses?

629
01:03:59,744 --> 01:04:01,678
-It was his horse.
-No, it's not.

630
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:04,313
You have it your own ignorant way.

631
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:09,846
As far as I know, that horse is his.

632
01:04:10,321 --> 01:04:14,417
He had it in Texas and I saw him bring
it to Mexico across a river.

633
01:04:15,526 --> 01:04:17,653
That is not the facts.

634
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:23,993
We can make the truth here. Or we can lose it here.

635
01:04:25,336 --> 01:04:28,499
But in three days, you're going to be
going to Saltillo.

636
01:04:30,007 --> 01:04:32,373
Then it'll be too late for the truth.

637
01:04:33,511 --> 01:04:34,773
Too late.

638
01:04:36,514 --> 01:04:39,779
Because you'll be in the hands of other peoples...

639
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:43,352
...and who's to say what the truth will be then?

640
01:04:46,357 --> 01:04:49,019
And then you'll think about this day...

641
01:04:50,194 --> 01:04:52,094
...and you'll blame yourself.

642
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:54,530
There ain't but one truth.

643
01:04:55,533 --> 01:04:58,696
Truth is not what come out of somebody's mouth.

644
01:05:01,205 --> 01:05:03,935
The people in this town are very quiet people.

645
01:05:04,208 --> 01:05:06,540
Very quiet people all the time.

646
01:05:07,244 --> 01:05:10,941
And then comes this assassin Blevins...

647
01:05:11,215 --> 01:05:14,981
...and he kills everybody and steals their horses.

648
01:05:15,486 --> 01:05:17,420
Why does he do this?

649
01:05:18,055 --> 01:05:20,956
Was he a good, quiet boy that never did no harm?

650
01:05:21,158 --> 01:05:25,219
Then he comes here and does something
like that? ls that what happened?

651
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:31,234
No. No, that's not what happened.
That's not the truth.

652
01:05:31,902 --> 01:05:34,837
Truth is he was always the other kind of boy.

653
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:38,332
He was never a quiet boy.

654
01:05:38,642 --> 01:05:40,507
He was always the other kind.

655
01:06:07,271 --> 01:06:08,761
What happened?

656
01:06:09,874 --> 01:06:11,000
Nothing.

657
01:06:12,443 --> 01:06:14,707
I think we're going to Saltillo.

658
01:06:16,614 --> 01:06:18,775
What's in Saltillo?

659
01:06:21,819 --> 01:06:24,151
The penitentiary.

660
01:06:24,989 --> 01:06:27,719
I think he wants to make a deal with us.

661
01:06:29,693 --> 01:06:31,524
What kind of a deal?

662
01:06:32,963 --> 01:06:34,453
To keep quiet.

663
01:06:35,299 --> 01:06:36,994
That kind of a deal.

664
01:06:38,802 --> 01:06:40,667
Keep quiet about what?

665
01:06:41,972 --> 01:06:43,633
About Blevins.

666
01:06:46,577 --> 01:06:48,875
About what about Blevins?

667
01:06:52,049 --> 01:06:53,914
I think they aim to kill him.

668
01:06:56,921 --> 01:06:59,151
I think they aim to kill Blevins.

669
01:07:10,467 --> 01:07:11,729
Boys...

670
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:15,234
...this is going to be a long trip.

671
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:18,235
The old man said it would take all day.

672
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:21,477
I asked him. He said it was going to take all day.

673
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,422
What's here?

674
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:42,398
Unload the prisoners, boys.

675
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,430
What do we do here?

676
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:45,363
Take a leak, I reckon.

677
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,669
Unload the prisoners.

678
01:07:59,049 --> 01:08:03,110
Put them against the wall. Sit them down.

679
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,132
Let's go.

680
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:28,638
What are they going to do?

681
01:08:29,913 --> 01:08:33,644
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Let go of me.

682
01:08:34,251 --> 01:08:35,240
Wait a minute.

683
01:08:35,919 --> 01:08:37,716
Wait a minute. Let go of me.

684
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,621
This man came to me.

685
01:11:01,899 --> 01:11:03,560
I don't go to this man.

686
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:06,702
He came to me to talk with me about justice...

687
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:11,969
...and how his own brotherhad died
at the hands of the assassin Blevins.

688
01:11:12,176 --> 01:11:14,736
Then when it came time to do justice...

689
01:11:14,978 --> 01:11:16,411
...he could not shoot.

690
01:11:18,081 --> 01:11:19,708
He was like a woman.

691
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:26,816
A man cannot go out to do something...

692
01:11:27,925 --> 01:11:29,654
...and then not do it.

693
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,385
No, a man does not change his mind.

694
01:11:35,699 --> 01:11:38,361
That's always been my way in this world.

695
01:11:40,103 --> 01:11:41,593
You didn't have to kill him.

696
01:11:43,407 --> 01:11:45,739
Could've just walked him back to the truck.

697
01:11:46,009 --> 01:11:47,670
You don't know nothing.

698
01:11:49,613 --> 01:11:52,707
See, in my country, we don't have death for criminals.

699
01:11:55,452 --> 01:11:57,682
Monies have to be paid and...

700
01:11:58,255 --> 01:12:00,450
...arrangements have to be made.

701
01:12:02,726 --> 01:12:04,626
I tell you this because...

702
01:12:04,962 --> 01:12:07,897
...you'll have to make arrangements with these peoples.

703
01:12:09,032 --> 01:12:10,090
We don't have no money.

704
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:14,830
In here we have a boss, a Jefe.

705
01:12:15,038 --> 01:12:18,132
Everybody pays him. Everybody does what he says.

706
01:12:19,076 --> 01:12:22,409
I don't have any money, 
and we ain't fixing to make any arrangements.

707
01:12:22,613 --> 01:12:24,706
Oh, excuse me, but you will.

708
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:28,975
I'm telling you this because I like you.

709
01:12:31,455 --> 01:12:33,286
You cannot stay here.

710
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:36,389
You stay here, you're gonna die.

711
01:12:38,595 --> 01:12:40,790
And then comes other problems.

712
01:12:41,131 --> 01:12:45,067
The paperwork is lost. People cannot be found.

713
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:51,400
Who's to say you were even here?

714
01:12:57,648 --> 01:13:00,913
Some crazy people can say that God is here.

715
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:07,246
But God is not here.

716
01:13:09,126 --> 01:13:11,356
Everybody knows that God is not here.

717
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:35,676
I never dreamed there was such a place as this.

718
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:40,048
There's probably every kind of place
you can think of.

719
01:13:44,394 --> 01:13:45,554
They're going to kill us.

720
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:48,863
Don't let them think they ain't gonna have to.

721
01:13:49,466 --> 01:13:51,730
They either kill us or let us be.

722
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:56,705
Only way to get by in a place
like this is go about your business.

723
01:13:57,507 --> 01:13:59,134
Don't act scared.

724
01:14:11,388 --> 01:14:12,753
Where are you going?

725
01:14:14,391 --> 01:14:16,154
I don't know, bud.

726
01:15:32,269 --> 01:15:33,634
Got a match?

727
01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:47,976
What is it?

728
01:15:48,185 --> 01:15:50,653
A knife. A good one.

729
01:19:12,055 --> 01:19:14,114
What's it like to be dead?

730
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:18,919
It ain't like nothing at all.

731
01:19:29,306 --> 01:19:31,297
What's it like to be dead?

732
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:34,167
It ain't like nothing at all.

733
01:20:06,843 --> 01:20:11,371
Yes, sir, you're a good healer. Fast.

734
01:20:11,848 --> 01:20:15,614
You been doing any doctoring
on a boy named Lacey Rawlins?

735
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:25,756
Send you some soap, some towels...

736
01:20:26,029 --> 01:20:28,259
...so you can wash up.

737
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:39,204
You don't know a Lacey Rawlins?

738
01:20:40,443 --> 01:20:42,138
You are fortunate boys.

739
01:20:42,712 --> 01:20:44,373
Fortunate boys.

740
01:20:46,883 --> 01:20:48,441
Where's Rawlins?

741
01:20:49,085 --> 01:20:50,712
He wait outside for you.

742
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:54,721
Right now?

743
01:20:55,558 --> 01:20:57,253
Yes, now.

744
01:20:57,961 --> 01:20:59,394
Where are we going?

745
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:02,922
You're going away. You're going to your house.

746
01:21:07,937 --> 01:21:09,131
Now?

747
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:12,063
Now.

748
01:21:15,345 --> 01:21:17,108
I thought you'd died.

749
01:21:17,981 --> 01:21:19,414
I thought you had.

750
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:28,482
Why ain't we dead?

751
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:31,955
She paid us out.

752
01:21:34,097 --> 01:21:35,587
The old senora?

753
01:21:35,799 --> 01:21:36,925
The aunt.

754
01:21:40,503 --> 01:21:41,595
Why?

755
01:21:41,838 --> 01:21:43,169
I don't know.

756
01:21:50,947 --> 01:21:52,972
It's got to do with that girl.

757
01:21:53,183 --> 01:21:54,946
I expect it does.

758
01:21:56,019 --> 01:21:57,850
You going back down there?

759
01:21:58,855 --> 01:22:00,516
Yeah, I guess I am.

760
01:22:00,857 --> 01:22:02,347
On account of the girl.

761
01:22:06,229 --> 01:22:07,787
But what about the horses?

762
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:11,961
The girl and the horses.

763
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:13,564
What about Rocha?

764
01:22:13,803 --> 01:22:16,294
He'll have to do whatever he has to do.

765
01:22:19,742 --> 01:22:20,868
Don't go down there.

766
01:22:21,077 --> 01:22:23,545
-I ain't asking you to go with me.
-I know.

767
01:22:30,854 --> 01:22:33,550
They put Mexican blood in me in that hospital.

768
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:35,018
So?

769
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:36,925
So, what does that mean?

770
01:22:37,126 --> 01:22:38,150
About what?

771
01:22:40,163 --> 01:22:41,960
Does that mean I'm part Mexican?

772
01:22:42,198 --> 01:22:43,563
How much they put in you?

773
01:22:44,834 --> 01:22:46,961
They said it was over a liter.

774
01:22:50,874 --> 01:22:52,899
A liter would make you a half-breed.

775
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:56,337
-It don't, does it?
-No.

776
01:22:56,746 --> 01:22:58,680
No, it don't mean nothing.

777
01:22:59,315 --> 01:23:02,648
It's just blood. It don't know where it come from.

778
01:23:09,826 --> 01:23:12,260
You heard about what happened?

779
01:23:14,364 --> 01:23:15,922
In the mess hall?

780
01:23:16,699 --> 01:23:17,825
Yeah.

781
01:23:18,234 --> 01:23:20,225
I never thought I'd do that.

782
01:23:21,738 --> 01:23:23,330
You didn't have no choice.

783
01:23:24,007 --> 01:23:25,838
He'd have done it to you.

784
01:23:27,243 --> 01:23:31,771
You don't got to try to make it right.
It is what it is.

785
01:23:37,921 --> 01:23:39,752
-Shit.
-What?

786
01:23:39,956 --> 01:23:41,719
Nothing. Just shit.

787
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:44,587
What is it?

788
01:23:46,963 --> 01:23:49,625
I keep thinking about old Blevins.

789
01:23:50,199 --> 01:23:52,190
About how scared he was.

790
01:23:54,437 --> 01:23:56,701
You'll feel better when you get home.

791
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,707
I don't think so.

792
01:24:06,115 --> 01:24:07,707
I ain't Blevins.

793
01:24:08,818 --> 01:24:10,285
I know you ain't.

794
01:24:11,387 --> 01:24:14,447
I was wondering how much better off
you are than him.

795
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:27,094
I reckon I'll see you one of these days.

796
01:24:30,573 --> 01:24:31,835
You take care.

797
01:24:33,676 --> 01:24:35,405
You take care too.

798
01:25:08,277 --> 01:25:10,177
I think I'm owed an explanation.

799
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:14,614
I think the accounts have been settled
quite in your favor.

800
01:25:15,451 --> 01:25:18,011
You have been a disappointment to my nephew...

801
01:25:18,221 --> 01:25:20,519
...and a considerable expense to me.

802
01:25:20,723 --> 01:25:25,126
No offense, ma'am, 
but I've been some inconvenienced myself.

803
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:29,360
Sit down, please.

804
01:25:39,976 --> 01:25:42,968
The officers were here once before, you know.

805
01:25:43,312 --> 01:25:48,648
My nephew sent them away until he
conducted his own investigation.

806
01:25:49,318 --> 01:25:53,254
He wanted so much to go on believing in you.

807
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:55,055
Why didn't he say something to me?

808
01:25:55,258 --> 01:25:57,590
He'd given his word to the commandante.

809
01:25:57,827 --> 01:25:59,920
He should've let me tell my side of it.

810
01:26:00,163 --> 01:26:04,566
You had already lied to him once. Why
shouldn't he assume you'd do so again?

811
01:26:05,001 --> 01:26:06,332
I never lied to him.

812
01:26:06,536 --> 01:26:10,495
The affair of the stolen horse was
known here even before you arrived.

813
01:26:11,607 --> 01:26:13,472
The thieves were Americans.

814
01:26:13,676 --> 01:26:17,168
When he questioned you about this,
you denied everything.

815
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:23,318
Why'd you buy me out ofjail?

816
01:26:23,519 --> 01:26:25,009
I think you know why.

817
01:26:25,221 --> 01:26:26,620
Because of Alejandra.

818
01:26:26,856 --> 01:26:27,823
Yes.

819
01:26:28,024 --> 01:26:29,685
What did she give in return?

820
01:26:30,026 --> 01:26:34,087
I think you know that also.

821
01:26:34,297 --> 01:26:35,764
That she won't see me again.

822
01:26:37,133 --> 01:26:38,600
Yes.

823
01:26:41,904 --> 01:26:43,565
You didn't have the right.

824
01:26:46,876 --> 01:26:48,275
You should've left me there.

825
01:26:48,478 --> 01:26:50,639
-You would've died.
-Then I'd have died.

826
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:57,783
We're willing that you should have a horse.

827
01:27:00,123 --> 01:27:03,320
I'll trust Esteban to supervise the selection.

828
01:27:04,227 --> 01:27:05,819
Do you have enough money?

829
01:27:08,898 --> 01:27:10,729
Do you have enough money?

830
01:27:13,402 --> 01:27:14,767
I aim to see her.

831
01:27:15,238 --> 01:27:17,229
Am I supposed to be surprised?

832
01:27:18,474 --> 01:27:20,942
I'll even give you my permission.

833
01:27:21,944 --> 01:27:25,778
Although that doesn't seem to be
a thing you have ever required.

834
01:27:27,517 --> 01:27:29,280
Her telephone number.

835
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:33,620
In the end, Mr. Cole...

836
01:27:35,258 --> 01:27:38,489
...we all get cured of our sentiments.

837
01:27:40,763 --> 01:27:43,664
Those whom life doesn't cure...

838
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:46,600
...death will.

839
01:27:51,207 --> 01:27:54,608
She will not break her word to me.

840
01:27:57,814 --> 01:27:59,372
You will see.

841
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:02,212
Yes, ma'am.

842
01:28:03,619 --> 01:28:04,711
We will.

843
01:28:23,406 --> 01:28:24,896
I knew it would be you.

844
01:28:27,643 --> 01:28:29,201
I have to see you.

845
01:28:30,813 --> 01:28:32,144
I can't.

846
01:28:35,718 --> 01:28:37,242
You have to. I'm coming.

847
01:28:37,486 --> 01:28:38,475
No, you can't.

848
01:28:41,657 --> 01:28:44,649
I won't be here. I go to La Purisima in two days.

849
01:28:44,861 --> 01:28:46,522
-I'll meet you at the train.
-No, you can't.

850
01:28:46,729 --> 01:28:48,492
My father will have men there.

851
01:28:49,498 --> 01:28:51,489
Alejandra, I love you.

852
01:28:54,070 --> 01:28:55,503
I love you.

853
01:28:57,506 --> 01:29:01,567
You didn't have no right to make
that promise, even if they killed me.

854
01:29:02,945 --> 01:29:05,277
I ain't gonna leave until I see you.

855
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:08,715
Even if it's the last time, I don't care.

856
01:29:10,119 --> 01:29:11,950
Even if they kill me now.

857
01:29:25,868 --> 01:29:28,029
I will leave a day early.

858
01:29:29,305 --> 01:29:31,102
Tomorrow morning.

859
01:29:33,209 --> 01:29:35,143
I'll say that my aunt is ill.

860
01:29:38,648 --> 01:29:40,707
Meet me in Zacatecas.

861
01:29:46,055 --> 01:29:47,147
I will be there.

862
01:30:47,216 --> 01:30:48,945
My God, you're beautiful.

863
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:01,890
-It's all my fault.
-You couldn't have saved us.

864
01:31:02,465 --> 01:31:04,296
You couldn't have saved Blevins.

865
01:31:07,303 --> 01:31:09,464
I told my father we were lovers.

866
01:31:10,873 --> 01:31:11,862
Why?

867
01:31:12,074 --> 01:31:14,474
Because she threatened me. My aunt.

868
01:31:14,710 --> 01:31:17,645
She said I must stop seeing you or she'd tell him.

869
01:31:18,814 --> 01:31:21,442
I couldn't stand for her to have that power.

870
01:31:21,650 --> 01:31:23,208
She left me no choice.

871
01:31:23,919 --> 01:31:25,546
I told him myself.

872
01:31:27,923 --> 01:31:31,256
I love you so much, I thought
I could make him understand.

873
01:31:32,161 --> 01:31:35,187
I was so foolish. It was her arrogance.

874
01:31:35,398 --> 01:31:37,866
I told her I would not be blackmailed.

875
01:31:38,234 --> 01:31:40,065
She made me crazy.

876
01:31:41,737 --> 01:31:43,830
But I broke my father's heart.

877
01:31:45,508 --> 01:31:47,408
I broke his heart.

878
01:31:48,277 --> 01:31:51,337
I put you in danger, and you almost died.

879
01:32:02,124 --> 01:32:07,061
He had Armando lock me into my room
so that I couldn't warn you.

880
01:32:09,365 --> 01:32:12,061
The next morning, he flew me back to the city.

881
01:32:12,701 --> 01:32:15,431
I thought I would never, never see you again.

882
01:32:17,573 --> 01:32:18,870
Don't cry.

883
01:32:23,646 --> 01:32:25,045
Don't cry.

884
01:32:28,818 --> 01:32:30,285
Don't cry.

885
01:32:37,493 --> 01:32:39,552
I destroyed everything.

886
01:32:40,229 --> 01:32:42,094
I'm going to make it right.

887
01:32:45,901 --> 01:32:47,129
You can't.

888
01:32:47,636 --> 01:32:49,160
Well, I will make it right.

889
01:32:49,905 --> 01:32:51,736
Somehow, I will.

890
01:32:53,175 --> 01:32:54,699
You don't understand.

891
01:32:54,910 --> 01:32:56,400
What don't I understand?

892
01:32:59,748 --> 01:33:03,149
I didn't know that my father could stop loving me.

893
01:33:05,588 --> 01:33:07,488
I didn't know he could.

894
01:33:08,824 --> 01:33:10,348
Now I know.

895
01:33:27,443 --> 01:33:28,876
What are you doing?

896
01:33:30,379 --> 01:33:33,439
I saw you dead in a dream.

897
01:33:37,219 --> 01:33:40,814
Just like the dream I had the night
before we danced together.

898
01:33:43,392 --> 01:33:45,155
It was dawn.

899
01:33:45,394 --> 01:33:47,988
Men in serapes stood over you.

900
01:33:50,466 --> 01:33:52,161
And you were dying.

901
01:33:55,004 --> 01:33:56,972
All because of your whore.

902
01:33:57,173 --> 01:33:58,731
Don't say that.

903
01:33:59,041 --> 01:34:01,475
I want you to marry me and come to Texas.

904
01:34:06,715 --> 01:34:10,412
When I found out you were in prison
I made a promise.

905
01:34:10,653 --> 01:34:13,213
I know. For my life.

906
01:34:13,422 --> 01:34:14,684
Yes.

907
01:34:19,328 --> 01:34:20,317
I love you.

908
01:34:22,998 --> 01:34:25,330
I'll love you till the day I die.

909
01:34:27,169 --> 01:34:28,830
I believe you.

910
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:31,870
I swear to God.

911
01:34:35,110 --> 01:34:36,737
I believe you.

912
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,297
No.

913
01:35:01,136 --> 01:35:03,468
I cannot do what you ask.

914
01:35:06,675 --> 01:35:11,044
I love you very much, but I cannot.

915
01:35:26,662 --> 01:35:29,654
I have no honor except my promise.

916
01:35:31,667 --> 01:35:33,828
If I lose that too...

917
01:35:35,337 --> 01:35:37,430
...then what am I?

918
01:37:50,806 --> 01:37:52,137
Shut the door.

919
01:37:59,982 --> 01:38:01,006
What do you want?

920
01:38:01,316 --> 01:38:03,181
I come for my horse.

921
01:38:04,219 --> 01:38:06,119
Rawlins' and Blevins' horses too.

922
01:38:06,321 --> 01:38:07,481
I don't have your horses.

923
01:38:07,689 --> 01:38:09,714
You by God know where they're at.

924
01:38:09,925 --> 01:38:11,688
You make trouble for yourself.

925
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:14,394
I got trouble you never even heard of.

926
01:38:19,268 --> 01:38:21,429
Are you still here, old man?

927
01:38:21,637 --> 01:38:23,400
Yes, yes of course.

928
01:38:24,673 --> 01:38:26,163
You're free to go.

929
01:38:26,508 --> 01:38:28,032
You're free to go.

930
01:38:28,277 --> 01:38:29,767
Thank you, partner.

931
01:38:30,112 --> 01:38:31,409
Go with God.

932
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:35,074
You son of the unlucky...

933
01:38:35,918 --> 01:38:36,714
Go with God.

934
01:38:36,919 --> 01:38:37,977
Go with God, my friend.

935
01:38:39,087 --> 01:38:40,918
Get down. Go inside.

936
01:38:47,996 --> 01:38:49,588
Come here. Sit down.

937
01:38:50,699 --> 01:38:52,997
Hey, who's there?

938
01:38:54,169 --> 01:38:56,103
Raul, the Captain.

939
01:38:59,107 --> 01:39:01,439
I want to see a horse.

940
01:39:04,046 --> 01:39:05,274
I want to see a horse.

941
01:39:05,547 --> 01:39:06,605
What horse?

942
01:39:06,882 --> 01:39:07,712
American.

943
01:39:09,685 --> 01:39:11,619
The American horse.

944
01:39:26,635 --> 01:39:28,796
What's going on?

945
01:39:29,171 --> 01:39:30,160
Nothing.

946
01:39:31,006 --> 01:39:31,995
Nothing.

947
01:39:38,914 --> 01:39:41,474
Carlos! The gringo has taken me prisoner!

948
01:40:40,876 --> 01:40:42,104
Don't shoot!

949
01:40:56,592 --> 01:40:59,220
If you follow us, I'll kill them.

950
01:41:01,263 --> 01:41:02,389
Stop!

951
01:41:03,231 --> 01:41:05,062
Goodbye, get out of here!

952
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:07,968
If you come back, I'll kill the Captain.

953
01:41:11,974 --> 01:41:12,741
You're going to die.

954
01:41:12,741 --> 01:41:13,571
You're going to die.

955
01:41:15,143 --> 01:41:18,772
Yeah, you can just keep talking.
When I die, you die.

956
01:41:19,948 --> 01:41:23,008
-Why don't you let me go?
-Because you're my hostage.

957
01:41:26,955 --> 01:41:30,516
Stay close, or I swear to God,
I'll shoot you. Go on.

958
01:41:31,994 --> 01:41:32,983
I'll shoot you.

959
01:41:33,261 --> 01:41:35,525
Have to come back to my town?

960
01:41:35,764 --> 01:41:37,857
I told you. For my horse.

961
01:41:44,339 --> 01:41:46,671
My head is sick. I can't ride no more.

962
01:41:46,875 --> 01:41:48,968
You'd be surprised at what you can do.

963
01:41:49,511 --> 01:41:52,002
You're going to die. You're going to die.

964
01:41:52,214 --> 01:41:54,842
We'll let God decide about that.

965
01:41:55,617 --> 01:41:57,244
You're not afraid of God?

966
01:41:57,452 --> 01:42:00,285
I'm not afraid of God. I got no reason to be.

967
01:42:01,289 --> 01:42:03,723
I even got a bone or two to pick with Him.

968
01:42:42,531 --> 01:42:44,328
Where are the keys?

969
01:42:44,933 --> 01:42:46,560
Where are the keys!!

970
01:42:56,344 --> 01:42:57,834
Goddamn you!

971
01:42:59,848 --> 01:43:01,839
Die, you son of a bitch!

972
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:12,694
Give me your goddamn hand.

973
01:43:28,110 --> 01:43:29,737
I'm not going to kill you.

974
01:43:33,949 --> 01:43:35,712
I'm not like you.

975
01:43:37,619 --> 01:43:38,950
Go on.

976
01:43:42,557 --> 01:43:44,115
You're free to go.

977
01:43:47,896 --> 01:43:49,329
Far as you can...

978
01:43:50,799 --> 01:43:52,096
...tote that saddle.

979
01:44:28,136 --> 01:44:30,161
Hey, give me the keys.

980
01:44:30,372 --> 01:44:32,806
Go over to the Captain.

981
01:44:42,350 --> 01:44:45,808
Don't let him get up. The keys.

982
01:44:54,496 --> 01:44:55,622
Beans...

983
01:44:56,665 --> 01:44:58,292
...and a rabbit.

984
01:44:59,301 --> 01:45:01,496
How is your wound?

985
01:45:05,807 --> 01:45:07,240
You doing okay?

986
01:45:07,709 --> 01:45:08,539
Thank you.

987
01:45:10,478 --> 01:45:11,672
Thank you.

988
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:34,197
Pants...

989
01:45:35,036 --> 01:45:36,367
...a serape.

990
01:45:41,509 --> 01:45:44,535
Go with God, my son.

991
01:46:29,424 --> 01:46:30,254
Howdy.

992
01:46:30,992 --> 01:46:32,550
Howdy. How you doing?

993
01:46:35,463 --> 01:46:37,226
Could you tell me what day it is?

994
01:46:39,401 --> 01:46:40,425
It's Thursday.

995
01:46:40,902 --> 01:46:42,267
I mean the date.

996
01:46:43,738 --> 01:46:45,000
It's Thanksgiving.

997
01:46:51,012 --> 01:46:53,503
Do either of you want to buy a rifle?

998
01:46:59,154 --> 01:47:00,849
No. I'm not interested.

999
01:47:02,257 --> 01:47:07,160
So I come back across and was riding on the road...

1000
01:47:07,762 --> 01:47:12,927
...and I run into this man, and he
told me I had to come see a judge.

1001
01:47:13,535 --> 01:47:15,469
There's a problem with the horses.

1002
01:47:15,670 --> 01:47:17,103
Your Honor...

1003
01:47:17,472 --> 01:47:20,771
...the fact of the matter is this boy
ain't got a lick of proof.

1004
01:47:21,276 --> 01:47:24,541
Three different horses and different brands on them.

1005
01:47:27,148 --> 01:47:31,107
Deputy Smith, you know what the trouble with a liar is?

1006
01:47:31,686 --> 01:47:35,452
Trouble with a liar is, he can't remember what he said.

1007
01:47:35,690 --> 01:47:37,453
I know that's right.

1008
01:47:38,293 --> 01:47:39,521
I ain't a liar.

1009
01:47:39,861 --> 01:47:41,624
I know that, son.

1010
01:47:42,364 --> 01:47:43,695
I know that.

1011
01:47:44,032 --> 01:47:49,163
I can't believe anybody would make up
a story like the one you just told.

1012
01:47:51,306 --> 01:47:53,672
Can I ask you a personal question?

1013
01:47:53,875 --> 01:47:55,001
Yes, sir.

1014
01:47:56,811 --> 01:48:00,474
You mind showing the court
them bullet holes in your leg?

1015
01:48:01,649 --> 01:48:02,911
Oh, all right.

1016
01:48:11,726 --> 01:48:13,318
That's where it come out.

1017
01:48:13,828 --> 01:48:15,489
That's fine, son. Thank you.

1018
01:48:18,566 --> 01:48:20,329
You didn't have medical attention?

1019
01:48:20,535 --> 01:48:21,661
No, Sir.

1020
01:48:22,003 --> 01:48:23,834
Wasn't none to be had.

1021
01:48:29,344 --> 01:48:30,709
Deputy Smith?

1022
01:48:30,912 --> 01:48:32,209
Your Honor?

1023
01:48:32,614 --> 01:48:36,414
I want you to see that this boy gets his horses back.

1024
01:48:37,352 --> 01:48:38,842
Son, you're free to go.

1025
01:48:40,555 --> 01:48:41,579
Thank you.

1026
01:48:41,790 --> 01:48:44,281
The court thanks you for your testimony.

1027
01:48:48,363 --> 01:48:50,729
In all the years I've sat on this bench...

1028
01:48:50,932 --> 01:48:55,767
...I heard lots of things that give me
grave doubts about the human race.

1029
01:48:56,037 --> 01:48:57,470
This ain't one of them.

1030
01:49:00,408 --> 01:49:01,636
All right.

1031
01:49:04,446 --> 01:49:06,107
You can go, boy.

1032
01:49:06,881 --> 01:49:08,041
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1033
01:49:26,734 --> 01:49:30,636
I don't like to bother you. But they
told me this is where you live.

1034
01:49:31,673 --> 01:49:34,801
That's all right. They were right.
Come on in.

1035
01:49:37,745 --> 01:49:40,509
-Thank you.
-Pleased to have you.

1036
01:49:43,751 --> 01:49:46,311
When I was in the penitentiary...

1037
01:49:46,754 --> 01:49:48,449
...I killed somebody.

1038
01:49:49,457 --> 01:49:50,924
I'm sorry to hear that.

1039
01:49:56,498 --> 01:49:58,591
He come at me with a knife.

1040
01:50:01,836 --> 01:50:02,860
So....

1041
01:50:03,338 --> 01:50:05,499
I just happened to get the best of him.

1042
01:50:09,310 --> 01:50:11,870
But that keeps bothering me somehow.

1043
01:50:13,114 --> 01:50:15,014
Something else, ain't there?

1044
01:50:15,216 --> 01:50:16,444
Yes, sir.

1045
01:50:22,223 --> 01:50:25,351
But later, I wanted to kill that other one too.

1046
01:50:26,127 --> 01:50:28,061
That Mexican captain.

1047
01:50:30,331 --> 01:50:31,855
Why do you suppose that is?

1048
01:50:33,801 --> 01:50:38,465
Because I sat there, and he walked
the boy out to the trees and shot him.

1049
01:50:41,342 --> 01:50:43,310
I didn't say nothing.

1050
01:50:46,014 --> 01:50:47,914
I didn't say a word.

1051
01:50:48,650 --> 01:50:50,242
Would it have done any good?

1052
01:50:51,753 --> 01:50:53,152
No, Sir.

1053
01:50:55,156 --> 01:50:56,885
That don't make it right.

1054
01:50:59,494 --> 01:51:01,189
And it never will.

1055
01:51:05,867 --> 01:51:09,200
Bothered me that you might think
that I'm something special.

1056
01:51:10,572 --> 01:51:11,732
I ain't.

1057
01:51:16,010 --> 01:51:18,069
You know what you strike me as?

1058
01:51:18,346 --> 01:51:21,577
One of them people that has a tendency...

1059
01:51:22,183 --> 01:51:24,845
...to be a little tough on themselves.

1060
01:51:26,254 --> 01:51:28,688
There's nothing wrong with you, son.

1061
01:51:30,191 --> 01:51:32,216
You'll get it sorted out.

1062
01:51:33,528 --> 01:51:34,756
I hope so.

1063
01:51:38,900 --> 01:51:40,458
If I live.

1064
01:51:43,238 --> 01:51:45,206
You'll live, all right.

1065
01:51:52,213 --> 01:51:56,047
Lacey once asked me if I thought
God looks out forpeople.

1066
01:51:57,552 --> 01:51:59,213
I guess He does.

1067
01:52:01,055 --> 01:52:03,455
I say He's just about got to.

1068
01:52:04,892 --> 01:52:07,725
I don't believe we'd make it a day otherwise.

1069
01:52:45,433 --> 01:52:47,924
Thought you'd want your old horse back.

1070
01:52:52,273 --> 01:52:53,934
Damn, bud.
