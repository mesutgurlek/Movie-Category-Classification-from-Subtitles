1
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,098
- Pull up!
- I'm Jamie Wagner.

2
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:13,169
- I'm looking for work.
- You're looking in funny places.

3
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,417
- You ran away from home?
- No, sir.

4
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,533
Climb down. Food's cooking.

5
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,174
Mister, maybe
I'd better be pushing on.

6
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,618
- I gotta be somewhere.
- There's nowhere here to go to.

7
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,459
I've got to be at the Nash ranch.

8
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,653
It's too far.
You won't make it tonight.

9
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,455
- Are they expecting you?
- No, sir.

10
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:33,171
Nobody eats without tending to the
stock. You'll find hay in the barn.

11
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,258
Set fire to the place
and I'll roast you over the ashes.

12
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,093
Roast me?
That's a pure Indian thing.

13
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,448
He don't scare me much.

14
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:58,090
Don't worry, I don't eat kids.
Not when I've got a good side of beef.

15
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,734
If you're still scared of me, sleep in
the shed. Warmer in here, though.

16
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,450
I'm sorry, sir.

17
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,413
- I answer to Chino.
- Yes, sir.

18
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,569
I almost got stomped to death
by a bronco once.

19
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,615
I never did learn nothing by it.
I still work at the same fool trade.

20
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,290
- You ever work with horses?
- No, sir.

21
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,338
'Attaboy. Easy. Back, back.

22
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,975
Back, back.

23
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,012
Back.

24
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,932
Easy.

25
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,299
Good morning.

26
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,850
- You're late getting started, kid.
- I have to clean up.

27
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,690
I can't pay you nothing.

28
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,212
Just earning my way
for last night's bed and board.

29
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:33,853
Boy, let your horse rest. I'll lend
you a mount and you can ride with me.

30
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,211
- I gotta fetch in a mare.
- Yes, sir.

31
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,012
This here's Buck. Mount him.

32
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,692
- You afraid of old Buck?
- No, sir.

33
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,734
Then ease up. Ride him around a bit.

34
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,258
- I see you didn't come off.
- He's a real gentle horse.

35
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:57,808
Buck, gentle?
That horse is pure mustang.

36
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,698
He seems to ride gentle for me.

37
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:15,016
- Boy, what day is this?
- Wednesday.

38
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,656
I forgot about that buyer.
I gotta drive these horses to town.

39
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,738
- Can I help?
- Don't need it.

40
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,491
- I'd like to ride Buck some more.
- Just stay out of the way.

41
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,210
200 dollars, Chino. Right?

42
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,616
<i>Buenos Dias, Indio.</i>

43
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,415
Buenos Dias, Señora.

44
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,015
I can read your dirty mind, Indio.

45
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,971
Stop it!

46
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:15,810
Ricardo.
If you please, Mr Jensen.

47
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,177
Ricardo.

48
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,177
Thank you.

49
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,895
- Howdy, Lemoine.
- Jesus, Chino...

50
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,490
- You didn't hear what he said.
- No.

51
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,091
- Who's this?
- He's a stray. Name's Jamie.

52
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,456
Lemoine,
keep this for me till morning.

53
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,619
- Staying in town tonight?
- Yeah, I'm tired and thirsty.

54
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,810
Boy, take the horses to the stable
and buy yourself a decent meal.

55
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,296
- I'll be at the Eagle Bar.
- Don't make no more trouble.

56
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,617
I'll do my best.
I don't come to town often.

57
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,495
The town couldn't take it often
and neither could you.

58
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,617
- You work for him?
- Sort of.

59
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,098
You stay with Chino,
I don't make trouble.

60
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,976
There's a law for a boy
who don't take care of himself.

61
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,252
I can take care of myself.

62
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,168
Oh, no, Chino, please, no.
Not here.

63
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:07,500
I just got through fixing it up.
There are other bars in town.

64
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,339
Hell, Pete, there's nobody here.

65
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:16,172
Please, take the bottle
some other place.

66
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,056
I'll just sit over there and drink it.

67
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,970
Good morning, gentlemen.

68
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,097
Guess I will drink it someplace else.

69
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,774
Damn it, Chino.

70
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,330
You leave now.

71
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,408
This is for damages.

72
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,930
- I came in for a bottle.
- Oh, yeah.

73
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,855
- What happened?
- We're going back to the ranch.

74
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,417
Good thing I was here to help
with the horses.

75
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,009
I've taken those horses to town
by myself a hundred times.

76
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,576
But you didn't help out too badly.

77
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:22,776
To get to the Nash ranch,
go down this canyon to a fork.

78
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:28,338
Take the left one. After a while
you'll see some wagon tracks.

79
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,929
They'll take you right there.

80
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:53,013
You know, I could feed the horses,
clean the stables, too.

81
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,179
Give you more time
for the important work.

82
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,490
Winter's coming.

83
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,533
You're gonna need a lot of wood.
I could chop kindling.

84
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:32,370
Boy I think that horse of yours
could do with another day's rest.

85
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,779
- What do you think?
- Yes, sir.

86
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,449
Whoa Hold that horse down.

87
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,130
You wanna work,
put that saddle on Buck.

88
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,090
- What's this mare you're after?
- Brood mare carrying a late foal.

89
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,690
- I want her back.
- You do that with all your mares?

90
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,609
- No, this one's special.
- A mustang?

91
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:07,496
Pure through. All iron guts
and shaped like a bottle.

92
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,737
Boy, you ought to catch that one!

93
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,136
That's Black. I raised him.

94
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:26,013
- What a beautiful horse.
- His papers go back to England.

95
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:31,852
Probably has his mares bunched back
there. Take a look from the ridge.

96
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,939
But take it easy. They're
a little wild and shy of strangers.

97
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:11,570
The mare's not here!
I'm going to track her down.

98
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:54,377
- Is it all right?
- Yeah. It's a he.

99
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,368
- Got me a fine stud.
- He acts as if you're its mother.

100
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:03,938
I guess I'm gonna have to be.
She's had a bad accident.

101
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,659
Get your pillow and put it
in front of the stove.

102
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,137
Here you are, that's your bed.

103
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,650
Get a fire going
and heat up some water.

104
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,859
What do you think of Banner?

105
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,497
I'm gonna name him Banner. Flag was
his sire and Banner's a good name.

106
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,612
It is a good name.

107
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,978
- There you go, my boy.
- I got him.

108
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,689
He don't need more Mama than that.

109
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,415
You don't look like the Mama-sort.

110
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,455
I guess not. It took me
three years to pay for Flag.

111
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,732
The blood in this foal
is everything I worked for.

112
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,616
It makes up for a lot of hard times
and towns where I wasn't welcome.

113
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:39,417
I'll be his Mama. But you tell anybody
that and I'll cut your ears off.

114
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,731
<i>Gracias.</i>

115
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:01,332
- I'm looking for Morrel.
- Catherine Morrel. Can I help you?

116
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:05,089
- Or would you like to wait?
- You're his wife?

117
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:09,532
- No, I'm his sister.
- You sure don't sound like him.

118
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,174
- Well, Mr...
- Valdez.

119
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:17,738
Mr Valdez, I'm his half sister.
My mother was English.

120
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,013
You can pick your friends
but you can't pick your relatives.

121
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,577
- What do you have against my brother?
- Who is here?

122
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,131
- You put up that fence?
- Yes. Why?

123
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:41,572
One of my mares cut herself to pieces
on that goddamn wire.

124
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,816
I had to shoot her.

125
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:50,219
I'm moving over 1000 head of cattle
to graze. I want it enclosed.

126
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,980
The wire cuts me off
from the horse range.

127
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:58,174
- That's my fence on my land.
- That land is open range.

128
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,814
Not according to the latest survey.

129
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:05,377
The Morrel land extends
50 miles north of here!

130
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:11,973
If you don't like it here, I'll give
you a fair price for your horses!

131
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:19,938
- Is it true about the survey?
- Yes, I'm afraid it is.

132
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,531
Mr Valdez?

133
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:32,860
Could I come out
and look at your horses?

134
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,973
- What for?
- I'd like to ride while I'm here.

135
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:41,378
I've heard yours are the best.
I'd like to buy one.

136
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,413
Come out, I'll have one for you.

137
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,931
Good morning, Mr Valdez.
I'm ready.

138
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:47,737
I can see that. And I can see
you brought a nurse with you.

139
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,937
- She's a beautiful horse.
- Her name is Paloma.

140
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:55,372
- When can I ride her?
- Well, I have to...

141
00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:00,131
- What the hell is that?
- That's a side saddle.

142
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:06,210
A side saddle? Are you going
to put that on the side of the horse?

143
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:12,737
No, my right leg goes around that hook
and my left one comes up against that.

144
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:18,492
- I can ride beautifully like that.
- Not on one of my horses you can't.

145
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,409
But I wear a skirt.
How else can I ride?

146
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:28,138
I can loan you a saddle,
but the clothes are your trouble.

147
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:37,169
Thank you, Mr Valdez. I'll think
of a way to do this properly.

148
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,055
- Goodbye, Jamie.
- Bye, ma'am.

149
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,856
Harris.

150
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:15,535
- She shouldn't say words like that.
- What words?

151
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:20,169
Well, she said, "legs".

152
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:25,500
Legs? What's wrong with legs?
She's got them, ain't she?

153
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:32,339
I reckon. It's just not a word that a
high class lady like her should use.

154
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:38,170
- Why not?
- It isn't considered proper.

155
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:43,579
A man should be awful careful
what he says around ladies, too.

156
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:49,252
How can you teach a lady to ride
if you can't say "legs" or "hands"?

157
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:56,289
You can say "hands". It's the parts
they cover up you can't talk about.

158
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:05,379
I don't pay mind to women. I've got
more important things to think of.

159
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,856
- You do?
- Don't you?

160
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:14,770
Yes, but I think about women
every now and then.

161
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:19,531
Not me, I ain't never going
to get mixed up with womenfolk.

162
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:24,416
What a man says and what a man
does isn't always the same.

163
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,418
Let's go. We got work to do.

164
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,210
When I get set on this,
jerk the gate open.

165
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,219
Chino!

166
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,810
Me and that damn Black
never did get along.

167
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:47,459
- Are you going to bust him?
- You know what that means?

168
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,213
- Show him you can't be thrown.
- No, that ain't all of it.

169
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,129
Busting a horse means exactly that.
You bust him.

170
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:03,572
That takes all the spunk out
of a horse. It breaks him.

171
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,329
And I ain't about
to break a Valdez horse.

172
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:16,051
I guess me and that Black
we just don't like each other.

173
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,811
You got scars all over you.
Where'd you get the one on your back?

174
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:24,171
If I told you,
I suppose you'd believe me.

175
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:28,419
- Yes, I would.
- That's a hell of a thing to say.

176
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,817
How you know what I'm gonna tell you?

177
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,858
If you said it, I'd know it was so.

178
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:42,180
Only a fool makes up his mind about
a thing before he knows what it is.

179
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:49,139
Bunch of Indians stole my horses
once and I stole them back.

180
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:54,892
While they was chasing me, I came
off my horse and got run over.

181
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:01,338
- Why didn't they kill you?
- Hell, boy, they was my friends.

182
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:53,858
- Good morning.
- I've worked the kinks out of her.

183
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,775
Well, mount up.

184
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,255
You won't be needing that.

185
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:16,896
Well, I'll be damned.
You made yourself a pair of pants.

186
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,610
Mr Valdez,
would you please help me up?

187
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:34,457
Why do you want to ride a horse
when you can't even get on one?

188
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,458
Ease up.

189
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:53,648
Miss Morrel, you ain't a wood Indian
and you ain't a sack of potatoes.

190
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:59,536
And that ain't no dumb kept hack
you're on, that's a Valdez horse!

191
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:03,528
You don't want to fight her or have
her carry you like a bedroll either!

192
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:09,178
- I do feel a little strange this way.
- You look a little strange. Pull up.

193
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:15,331
The first thing you gotta remember
is to squeeze the horse with your...

194
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,213
- What do you call that?
- My knee.

195
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,376
- And that?
- My leg.

196
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:25,290
- And that?
- What? That's my back.

197
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,288
- Those parts are all covered.
- Of course they're covered.

198
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:36,055
What would you say
if I was to say "leg"?

199
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:41,575
- Are you all right, Mr Valdez?
- Yes. But I don't know about the boy.

200
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:50,411
You squeeze the horse with your knees
and you put your weight in your legs.

201
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,009
Try it again.

202
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:59,774
- It does feel more comfortable.
- You don't look more comfortable.

203
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:04,815
Your knees, your knees.
Put some of that weight in your legs.

204
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:10,616
That's terrible.
You're still bouncing.

205
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:15,974
- I have to bounce some.
- You've got a lot of bouncy parts!

206
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,654
I guess a woman wasn't made
for riding horses.

207
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,973
Mr Valdez, you are crude,
insensitive and vulgar.

208
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:34,537
You're not a man at all,
you're a horse!

209
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:42,816
I'll send Cruz back to pick up Paloma.
Cruz!

210
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:29,978
Jamie, you might still be thinking of
finding a job on one of the ranches.

211
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,699
But the hiring season's over.

212
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:39,333
I'd like to keep you on.

213
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:44,730
- I'll pay you 10 dollars a month.
- 10 dollars?

214
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:50,173
- Ain't that enough?
- You'll see, Chino. I'll be worth it.

215
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,576
Thanks.

216
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,695
You know, Chino,
Christmas is only two weeks.

217
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:13,458
We ought to have a tree.
A real Christmas tree.

218
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,173
A Christmas tree?

219
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:19,134
Yeah. Didn't you have one
where you come from?

220
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:24,892
Where I come from there weren't
enough trees to cut any down.

221
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:56,538
Apart from that mustache,
you even look like a horse.

222
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:03,336
Sound like one, too,
and scrub your back like one.

223
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,256
Yeah?
Just turn around and get on out.

224
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:13,933
I don't think so. Now that I'm here,
I think I'll have a cup of tea.

225
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:19,691
- Don't keep no tea here.
- Coffee will do.

226
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:31,259
Don't mind me, Mr Valdez, I've seen
horses wallow in water before.

227
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:35,373
Continue with your bath.
It looks like such fun.

228
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:40,938
Is that a fact? Well, I'm through,
so if you'll hand me that towel...

229
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:45,770
Of course you're not through.
You didn't finish washing your back.

230
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,653
I think I'll help you.

231
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,652
Boy! Jamie!

232
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:55,057
You're not frightened of me,
are you, Mr Valdez?

233
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:59,219
If you call me Mr Valdez once more,
I'll yank you in this tub with me.

234
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,729
Oh, well...

235
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:05,376
What do I call you? Horse?

236
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:18,019
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to show you my new saddle.

237
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:23,499
- Is that all?
- No. I wanted to ask you something.

238
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,209
I'd like to continue riding.

239
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:32,529
But if I'm as hopeless
as you say I am, it's pointless.

240
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:37,096
No, I didn't say hopeless.

241
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,736
What I said was terrible.

242
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:44,853
Well, that's all right then, isn't it?

243
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,940
<i>You can get out of the bath. I'll make
some coffee and we'll talk about it.</i>

244
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:21,530
That's amazing.
He comes when you whistle.

245
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,095
I raised that horse from a baby.

246
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:31,257
- Do you ever ride him?
- Some horses weren't meant to saddle.

247
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:41,128
Let her go, Chino!
Please!

248
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,737
Then I'll have to catch her again.

249
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,654
Please!

250
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:25,296
I'm going to have to work
without bringing you along.

251
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,890
I'm sorry, Chino.

252
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,649
Why'd you get so upset?

253
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:39,010
I couldn't stand to see her frightened.
I felt as if it were me.

254
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,853
You ain't got any
of your brother in you.

255
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:50,616
If you had, I wouldn't
have all this feeling for you.

256
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,851
Nice foal.

257
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,973
Very fine looking.

258
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:46,978
- First one, huh?
- First one born on this range.

259
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:53,374
Your roots are beginning to take hold.
Yes, it's coming along.

260
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,939
The wild horse man making
himself a home.

261
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,769
Soon you'll have curtains
in your windows.

262
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:08,816
- You like it here?
- It's got good grass, good water.

263
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:15,617
- Get to the point, Morrel.
- All right. Listen carefully.

264
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:23,573
- You're not to see my sister again.
- What's she got to say about this?

265
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,499
Nothing. I say it!

266
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:32,251
You try to see her again, I'll burn
your place down and run you out.

267
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,098
I've got work to do.

268
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:39,977
Chino, as long as you're
on my land, you do as I say!

269
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,173
<i>Vamonos!</i>

270
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,858
Come here, girl.

271
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:06,370
That's a girl. Come here.

272
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,773
Come here, girl.

273
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,696
Come here, girl.

274
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,495
Come here, girl.

275
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,617
Come here, girl.

276
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,729
Come here, girl.

277
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:30,571
Good horse.

278
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,653
Boy?

279
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:57,818
We've got some packing to do.
We're gonna take a trip.

280
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:45,173
Black, you take good care
of your ladies!

281
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,455
That's how the Indians
bury their dead.

282
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:13,335
They want to be close to the sun.

283
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:55,252
Take these horses off to the side.
Hurry, now.

284
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:58,289
- Jamie.
- Jamie.

285
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,775
Jamie.

286
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:08,578
That's Little Bear. I scalp him every
time, but he never gives up trying.

287
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,933
Jamie.

288
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:45,894
Don't let it bother you.
They don't see yellow hair much.

289
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:50,173
When they get the pack off the horse,
you picket them.

290
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,768
I have work to do.

291
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:05,259
Me Jamie.

292
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:09,252
- Jamie.
- Yeah.

293
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:16,614
What's your name?

294
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,935
Oh yeah, it's a good name.

295
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:39,418
Very nice.

296
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:42,490
Very nice. Good.

297
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:56,416
Want to trade? Good knife.

298
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:00,051
Two blades.

299
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,856
Trade.

300
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,052
Understand?

301
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:12,408
Trade.

302
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:25,093
Yeah?

303
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:31,489
Come on in, boy.

304
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:38,731
I couldn't get to sleep over there.
I thought Indians were quiet.

305
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:44,090
- Take that bunk.
- Thanks.

306
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:56,297
Were these the Indians
that ran over you?

307
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:01,335
Yeah, the very same ones.
I used to live with them.

308
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:04,771
I was coming north from Texas.

309
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:08,375
Searching for a place, like you are.

310
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:13,415
I came through this rough country
and fell in with a band of Cheyenne.

311
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:17,010
The way they invited me to stay
I couldn't do otherwise.

312
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:21,850
- They captured you?
- Nobody knew for certain.

313
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:27,535
I liked the free way they lived,
so I stayed and we became friends.

314
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:33,451
- Why did you leave?
- Soon there won't be many left.

315
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:37,255
Nor men like me.

316
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:42,580
Anyway, I wanted a place of my own
and I got one now.

317
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:46,376
I also got a problem.

318
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:50,818
I'm up here to think things out.

319
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:56,889
Chino
How long are we going to stay?

320
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,820
We leave first thing in the morning.

321
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,372
Thanks.

322
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:55,733
Thanks.

323
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:00,371
Thanks.

324
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:36,897
- Moccasins.
- Look like moccasins.

325
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:43,656
I traded my knife.
The good one I had.

326
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:51,458
It was this Indian girl
that made them.

327
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:54,857
You came out here to grow up,
didn't you?

328
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:58,291
- And you're growing up.
- Yes, sir.

329
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:03,176
- Well, here's your tree.
- Gosh!

330
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:08,212
Get cleaned up,
we're going into town.

331
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:09,658
What are they doing?

332
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:12,613
Acting out something
that happened a long time ago.

333
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:18,178
The statues are Joseph and
the Virgin Mary looking for shelter.

334
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:22,578
The Christ child is about to be born.

335
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:09,013
Go over and make yourself
some friends.

336
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:48,418
We don't have much time.

337
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:52,771
- Your brother came to see me.
- I know, Chino.

338
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:55,972
- He warned me to stay away from you.
- I don't care.

339
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:59,377
I've been thinking.

340
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:10,934
And I've made up my mind.

341
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:16,054
We ought to get married.

342
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:17,534
Oh, Chino.

343
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:22,172
I'll take the other door.

344
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:26,214
I'll talk to the priest
and take care of everything.

345
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:30,650
See you in church the morning
after Christmas.

346
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:18,574
All right, everybody to jail.

347
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:23,615
Boy, you go back to the ranch.
You won't see Chino for a while.

348
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:13,378
Chino!

349
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,939
Sheriff let me out for Christmas.

350
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:34,612
I'll be damned. That's the prettiest
Christmas tree I've ever seen.

351
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:38,290
I got something for you.

352
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:44,656
I made it myself.

353
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:51,410
That's a fine piece of work, Jamie.
I've got something for you, too.

354
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:04,338
This is ten times better
than my last knife.

355
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:08,813
This turned out to be
a good Christmas.

356
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:12,057
I bet it's even better than Morrel's.

357
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:15,969
Even though he's got money
and a big house and everything.

358
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:19,456
This house ain't big, but it's solid.

359
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:23,619
I built it myself, too. And now
that I'm going to get married.

360
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:25,094
Married?

361
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:29,612
Yes. I'm going
to marry Catherine, Jamie.

362
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:32,334
About time I raised a family
as well as horses.

363
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:36,135
- That means you'll live at Morrel's.
- Why would I do that?

364
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:43,730
- You're not going to bring her here?
- A woman goes where her man is.

365
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:46,932
I know the place needs fixing up.

366
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:50,931
All I gotta do is add a room or two
off the bedroom.

367
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:54,416
And I'll get one of them
big Franklin stoves...

368
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:57,532
...so she can do some baking
as well as cooking.

369
01:14:57,740 --> 01:15:01,858
A couple of hide rugs on the floor.
I'll need a new bed.

370
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:09,369
So she won't have to boil her clothes,
she can use this trough here.

371
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:15,295
I'll get her a new washing board
and one of them clothes wringers.

372
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:28,458
I'd better put Macho in the stable.

373
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:01,257
- Where's Chino?
- I'm waiting for him.

374
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:05,458
Go home. You are not to marry him.

375
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:09,619
You can't tell me what to do.

376
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:16,011
If you insist, I will kill him.

377
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,618
It's your choice.

378
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:44,252
But you remember, in the future,
my life is my own.

379
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:24,017
<i>Padre?</i>

380
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:42,618
You have to forgive me, father.

381
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:50,017
Enough.

382
01:18:55,660 --> 01:19:00,176
If I see you on my land after today,
I won't stop the whip -

383
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:02,769
- until you're dead.

384
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:11,250
Let's go!

385
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:16,691
I'll get the sheriff!
I'll get the doctor!

386
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:20,458
Just help me get to the wagon.

387
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:28,611
Little Bear!

388
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,968
Little Bear!

389
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:43,975
Chino's hurt!

390
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,337
Chino!

391
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:21,299
- Chino.
- What's wrong?

392
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:32,771
- I thought you were dead.
- I don't die that easy.

393
01:21:32,980 --> 01:21:36,734
Jamie, you did the right thing,
bringing me here.

394
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:42,856
You go back to the ranch and take
care of things. I'll be there.

395
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:01,934
Chino!

396
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:21,653
I picked up your hat in town today.
Chino, what are you going to do?

397
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:26,809
I'm going to have a cup of coffee,
and tomorrow we got work to do.

398
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:33,853
They say, in town, if you stay here,
they'll run you out or even kill you.

399
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:36,335
No, they won't kill me.

400
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:40,533
I've left a lot of places
but only when I wanted to.

401
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:46,779
- She shouldn't have done that.
- Don't say anything more about it.

402
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:49,778
It's all over.

403
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:30,778
- What is it?
- Something's wrong.

404
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:51,973
That's the first one, Indian!
Your stud horse is next!

405
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:04,210
Why, Chino, why?

406
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:27,698
Go back and get your stuff packed.

407
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:38,091
There's the stud.

408
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:44,014
Let's go get it.

409
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:09,374
<i>Venga!</i>

410
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:53,136
Take him.

411
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:04,698
He's shooting his horses.

412
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:10,099
No, he's spooking them.

413
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:37,888
If he doesn't keep them,
nobody does.

414
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:54,418
Morrel, I'm leaving!

415
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:09,013
Just say the word,
and he's a dead man.

416
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:16,854
Put your guns down.

417
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:20,219
It's over.

418
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:25,571
Jamie, you can have Buck,
but keep in mind he's a Valdez horse.

419
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:29,938
I want to go with you.

420
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:35,178
No. We go different ways.
You've got your own life.

421
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:53,615
Goodbye, Chino.
