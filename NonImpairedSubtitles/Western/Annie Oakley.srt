1
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,507
Who you voting for
this November, Sheriff?

2
00:01:33,576 --> 00:01:35,544
- Me?
- Yes.

3
00:01:35,612 --> 00:01:37,978
James G. Blaine.

4
00:01:38,047 --> 00:01:39,571
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

5
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:43,816
Eph, here, is casting his ballot
for Grover Cleveland.

6
00:01:43,887 --> 00:01:45,184
No.

7
00:01:45,255 --> 00:01:47,815
You voting for that New York Copperhead?

8
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:50,485
You bet your life I be,

9
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,121
and he's gonna beat the britches
off of your Mr. Blaine.

10
00:01:56,332 --> 00:01:57,822
Lem! Lookit.

11
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,932
Slapping stickem all over your walls.

12
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:04,769
Well, you've got a gall,

13
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:08,004
smearing up Darke County
with them consarned stickers.

14
00:02:08,077 --> 00:02:09,601
Well, a man's gotta make a living.

15
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,146
Well, I can't help that.

16
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,945
You take that ding-busted thing
down off of my wall.

17
00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:19,318
Why, even the side of a man's cow
ain't safe from you fellows nowadays.

18
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,084
Go on, take it down.

19
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:25,056
Go on, take it down.

20
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,257
Lem, let's see the top half of it.

21
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:35,394
All right, hitch up the rest of him.

22
00:02:36,272 --> 00:02:39,264
If Annie Oakley likes him, he stays up.

23
00:02:39,342 --> 00:02:42,106
If she don't, down he comes.

24
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,758
Gosh, ain't he pretty?

25
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,166
All right, leave him up.

26
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:07,726
Who is he, Annie?

27
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:10,796
Toby Walker.
He's the greatest shot in the whole world.

28
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:12,466
Maybe at trick shooting, Annie,

29
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:15,102
but I'll bet he ain't one-two-three
with you on quail.

30
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:17,703
Oh, Lem, I just point a gun at them.

31
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:23,347
Say, that big hotel in Cinci's
still begging for some of your birds.

32
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:26,149
- You got some for me today?
- Sure, six dozen.

33
00:03:26,222 --> 00:03:28,122
All dressed and picked.

34
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:31,126
Bet at 50 yards, she can knock
the eye out of a bumblebee.

35
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:32,491
Yeah?

36
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:35,292
Yeah. Them quail she shoots
don't know what hits them.

37
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:37,094
Slab in the head every time.

38
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:40,033
Supported her folks pretty near five years
on that gun of hers.

39
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:42,264
Wish I could shoot that way.

40
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:45,569
Wish you could.
We'd have law and order in this county.

41
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,109
Sheriff.

42
00:03:47,176 --> 00:03:49,474
Do you remember the time
you aimed at a chicken thief...

43
00:03:49,545 --> 00:03:51,775
- Yeah.
...and killed a hog?

44
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:53,076
Killed...

45
00:04:00,456 --> 00:04:04,654
Mr. And Mrs. Quail,
won't you walk into my broiler?

46
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:10,423
Yes, sir and ma'am,
a warm welcome sure do await you.

47
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,297
Oh, my!

48
00:04:12,368 --> 00:04:16,134
I's gonna baptize you slow in hot butter.

49
00:04:16,205 --> 00:04:17,866
Hot butter!

50
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:21,035
And put you to sleep in a bed of rice.

51
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,943
<i>Sleep on, sweet quail</i>

52
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:27,210
Say, boy, how many of those quails
you done already counted?

53
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:30,514
- Twenty-six.
- Well, forget to count about four of them.

54
00:04:32,088 --> 00:04:34,249
Don't you think I like quail myself?

55
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:37,521
- I done already uncounted eight.
- That's right.

56
00:04:37,593 --> 00:04:38,821
Boys.

57
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:48,794
Your bad arithmetic's gonna
get you in trouble one of these days.

58
00:04:50,673 --> 00:04:54,268
Them quails ain't no good, Mr. Maclvor.
They full of buckshot.

59
00:04:54,344 --> 00:04:56,835
Not these quail.
They cost me fancy prices.

60
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:59,245
The hunter always hits them in the head.

61
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:02,443
That's right, boss.
That hunter sure is a shooting fool.

62
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:05,282
I want you boys to out-cook yourselves
on these quail.

63
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:08,051
The Mayor is giving this banquet
for Toby Walker.

64
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:10,922
Yes, sir, and it'll be fit for a king, too.

65
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:15,124
It better be. Mr. Walker is very particular.

66
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:34,240
Well, Toby Walker, I hereby pronounce you
a member of Buffalo Bill's happy family.

67
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:36,945
Yep, you've done a good day's work, Jeff.

68
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,547
Yes, I think so.
I think my partner will think so, too.

69
00:05:40,623 --> 00:05:43,820
Colonel Cody and I don't sign up
any second-raters, only champions.

70
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:48,330
So, you're a champion shooter, huh?
I don't believe it.

71
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:50,263
Take it easy. That's Toby Walker.

72
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:54,326
Never heard of him.
Bet I can beat him myself.

73
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:03,576
What are you laughing at?

74
00:06:03,646 --> 00:06:06,979
Well, maybe he could.
We haven't seen you shoot yet.

75
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,540
Well, money talks, Cap.

76
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,586
Your shooting rate's
pretty high around here.

77
00:06:10,653 --> 00:06:12,120
Why don't you take me on?

78
00:06:12,188 --> 00:06:13,985
I'm only an amateur.

79
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:16,651
I don't want any contest with you, Walker.

80
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:20,127
I'll lay you 3-to-1, and you can name
your own targets and distance.

81
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:23,495
- Take him on, Cap. He may not be so good.
- Sure, Cap. You're a good shot.

82
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:25,056
Take him on, Cap.

83
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,625
Ain't there one sport in this burg?

84
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:30,396
I'll give you 4-to-1.

85
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:36,273
Could you make that 5-to-1, Mr. Walker?

86
00:06:36,345 --> 00:06:38,472
Look, Mac, you better keep out of this.

87
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:40,914
We ain't betting marbles.
This is for money.

88
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,245
Oh, is that a fact?

89
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,185
Well, I believe I've got someone
that might make it interesting for you.

90
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:49,623
How about a little side bet of $100
to make it more interesting?

91
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,855
$100, eh? No, I don't think
that would interest me,

92
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:59,091
but $200 should do it.

93
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,229
Mac, it's a bet.

94
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:07,138
But you'll have to see my new boss here
to arrange the details.

95
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,236
Well, would tomorrow morning
at the Gun Club suit you, gentlemen?

96
00:07:10,313 --> 00:07:13,476
It's a go. Let's have a drink on it.
Oscar, set them up, on the house.

97
00:07:13,549 --> 00:07:15,642
- On the house.
- On the house!

98
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:17,242
Well, Mac...

99
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,221
Beers all around.
And make mine a short one.

100
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:21,756
Make mine a champagne cocktail.

101
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:23,951
- I'll take champagne, too.
- Make mine champagne, too.

102
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,220
Make mine champagne.

103
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:28,388
All right, Oscar,
I'll have a champagne cocktail.

104
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:32,527
Mac, if I hadn't been here to see this,
I wouldn't have believed it.

105
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:39,100
Put it back. I've lost my thirst.

106
00:07:40,343 --> 00:07:41,935
What's the matter, Mac?
Are you mourning?

107
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:43,842
Yeah, for his $200.

108
00:07:46,082 --> 00:07:49,142
- Oh, that's not for ladies.
- Oh, I'm no lady.

109
00:07:51,487 --> 00:07:54,183
Pardon me, miss, this is a saloon.

110
00:07:54,257 --> 00:07:56,088
Oh, how cozy.

111
00:07:59,128 --> 00:08:00,686
I've lived for 60 years

112
00:08:00,763 --> 00:08:04,563
and that's the first time
I ever saw a woman going into a saloon.

113
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:07,159
The next thing you know,
they will be smoking cigarettes.

114
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,534
Talk sense, man, talk sense.

115
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:13,598
- Here's to Toby Walker.
- Here's to Toby Walker!

116
00:08:14,343 --> 00:08:17,779
Well, gentlemen, I hardly know what to...

117
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:21,214
Hello, honey. Getting your hair curled?

118
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:31,192
What's the matter? Don't I get introduced?

119
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:36,224
Allow me, gents.
The great Toby Walker and Company.

120
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,661
I nearly forgot what time it is.

121
00:08:41,737 --> 00:08:46,800
They're probably yelling for me
at the theater. I...

122
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:50,603
Come on, get out of here.

123
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,410
Seems there's nothing sacred anymore.

124
00:08:57,353 --> 00:09:00,015
In all my born days
I've never seen such gall.

125
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:03,525
What are you trying to do, make a jackass
out of me in front of my public?

126
00:09:03,593 --> 00:09:07,120
- Honey.
- Don't honey me. You're too dang fresh.

127
00:09:07,196 --> 00:09:10,256
Toby Walker, you're supposed to be
a sharpshooter,

128
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:13,894
and you can't even see a willing gal
right under your own nose.

129
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,905
- I can see anything I'm aiming at.
- Yeah, I know.

130
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,238
You only go high, wide and handsome
for the lady swells,

131
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,278
like you claim you was
with Sarah Bernhardt.

132
00:09:24,914 --> 00:09:27,109
Let's leave Miss Bernhardt's name
out of this.

133
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:30,641
Bernhardt. You never knowed her
well enough to carry her trunks.

134
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,416
Listen, Vera, I think
you're a swell little trouper.

135
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,854
Now, let's leave it like that.

136
00:09:34,924 --> 00:09:37,984
You've got your ticket back to New York
and two weeks extra pay.

137
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,493
I'd keep you in the act if I could,

138
00:09:39,562 --> 00:09:43,089
but there just ain't no place
in the Buffalo Bill show for a gal.

139
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:46,032
Well, sharpshooter, I got to hand it to you.

140
00:09:46,102 --> 00:09:48,627
You sure got the power
to resist a beautiful woman.

141
00:09:48,704 --> 00:09:50,729
Well, don't take it too much to heart,
little girl.

142
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:52,831
Maybe I'm doing you a favor.

143
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:57,345
You know, Lily Langtry couldn't act
for sour apples till I turned her down.

144
00:09:58,447 --> 00:10:01,473
Talk louder, will you, Lem?
I can't hear you.

145
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,548
Blast these newfangled
instruments of torture.

146
00:10:07,623 --> 00:10:10,990
Hello. Oh, Lem, Lem. Just a minute.

147
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:16,492
Hello, Lem. Lem, I want you
to get a hold of that quail-shooter,

148
00:10:16,565 --> 00:10:19,125
the one that sells you the birds
you send up here.

149
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,862
I've got a shooting match.

150
00:10:20,936 --> 00:10:24,235
A shoot... A shooting match, Lem.

151
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:28,141
Aye. If he wins, there's $50 in it for him.

152
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,169
Yes, I said $30.
What did you say his name is?

153
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:36,481
Shake up the telephone, Lem.
I can't hear a word.

154
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:40,488
What? Oh, Oakley. Andy Oakley?

155
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,855
All right, Lem, all right.
Have him here in the morning.

156
00:10:43,926 --> 00:10:47,692
Oh, Lem, Lem, Lem,
and make certain sure he's sober.

157
00:10:47,763 --> 00:10:49,788
Aye, aye.

158
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:57,863
All ready, Joe?

159
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,674
Bend down, please. I want to see the sign.

160
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:07,013
Everybody ready?

161
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,516
Smile.

162
00:11:09,852 --> 00:11:12,821
Smile bigger. That's fine.

163
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:13,076
That's fine. That's a beauty.

164
00:12:19,221 --> 00:12:22,520
- Well, don't they know you're here?
- Come on, Ma.

165
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:29,157
- Who's shooting against you, Mr. Walker?
- A fellow by the name of Oakley.

166
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:33,099
A rube from the tall timber, by crackey!

167
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,761
Well, good luck to you.

168
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,361
Well, we'll have some fun, anyway.

169
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:37,770
If he ever gets here.

170
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,071
Hey, Mac, better get your man here.
I can't wait all day.

171
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:44,806
Oh, he'll be here all right.
He's had a long ways to come.

172
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,277
Well, I'll go down and warm up a bit.

173
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:56,651
I'm waiting to see that dark horse, Mac.

174
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:59,523
And the longer we wait,
the longer Mac keeps that $200.

175
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:03,861
Anyone that can hit quail in the head
with a single ball can shoot for my money.

176
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:06,401
Are you looking for me?
My name is Oakley.

177
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:09,099
Oakley?

178
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:13,064
- Where is your father?
- Well, he's dead.

179
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,203
Dead?

180
00:13:16,178 --> 00:13:19,477
- When did it happen?
- Oh, a long time ago.

181
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:25,946
- Then, where is your brother?
- This is my brother.

182
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:30,690
And this is my sister Susie and this is Ma.

183
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:33,421
Excuse me.

184
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:37,865
I am looking for an Andy Oakley
who's been supplying me with game.

185
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:42,293
Oh, I guess you made a mistake, mister.
Not Andy Oakley. Annie.

186
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:44,134
It's me you sent for.

187
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:46,201
You?

188
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:50,944
A joke's a joke,
but this one is just a little too practical.

189
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:53,641
But it's not a joke.
I want to bet my own money.

190
00:13:53,716 --> 00:13:55,479
Show him what you've got, Ma.

191
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:59,009
Lem sent down $10
and Sheriff Bixby sent down $5,

192
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,455
and a lot of other people chipped in.
$37 in all.

193
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:03,719
Yes, sirree.

194
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:07,728
Then forget about it.
There's not going to be any contest.

195
00:14:07,796 --> 00:14:10,026
Maybe you can settle for half, Mac.

196
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,567
You mean just because I'm not a man,
you ain't gonna let me shoot?

197
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:14,364
That's perfectly all right, Miss Oakley.

198
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:17,371
You're going to get your chance.
The bet still stands.

199
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,703
But I'll discount it and pay off right away,
Mr. Hogarth.

200
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,141
Oh, no, you don't.
The whole hog or nothing at all.

201
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:23,940
And I'm speaking for Toby Walker, too.

202
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:25,378
Toby Walker?

203
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,678
You're in big company now, Miss Oakley.

204
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:32,552
Oh, I couldn't shoot against Toby Walker.

205
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,317
Oh, now, you mustn't be afraid.
You just do the best you can.

206
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:37,382
Just pretend you're shooting quail.

207
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:42,522
Oh, I ain't scared he could beat me.
It's just that it don't seem reasonable.

208
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:43,792
Of course it isn't.

209
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:46,198
But we're going through with it
just the same.

210
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:48,259
Ma, can I have the money?

211
00:14:51,206 --> 00:14:54,642
Would... Would you bet the money for me?

212
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,406
Oh, yes, of course I'll bet it for you.

213
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:40,513
Here's yours, Annie.

214
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:42,955
Here. They don't belong to you.

215
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,493
Here's a seat for you, Mrs. Oakley.

216
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:03,241
Hey, don't meddle with those guns.

217
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:06,543
Oh, I'm sorry, mister,
but whenever I see a gun, I always...

218
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:08,606
What's a kid like you know about guns?

219
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:11,585
I got one here.
It was clean through the Civil War.

220
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:12,848
Well, gee... Well...

221
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:16,322
Well, gee whiz, don't tell me
you shoot with a thing like that?

222
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,518
Of course I do.

223
00:16:17,593 --> 00:16:19,788
What do you shoot? Doodlebugs?

224
00:16:20,596 --> 00:16:23,497
You hang around, kid, and you'll see
some shooting that is shooting.

225
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:27,057
I figured on seeing some tall shooting,
otherwise I wouldn't be here.

226
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:30,628
Up from the sticks to see me
make a monkey out of that Oakley?

227
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:32,765
The shootingest monkey you ever saw,

228
00:16:32,841 --> 00:16:34,900
and we got $37 says so.

229
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:38,504
No! About all the ready cash
in that county, I suppose.

230
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,309
Bring on that hickory-nut-knocker.

231
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:43,146
Mr. Walker,
meet Miss Hickory-nut-knocker.

232
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:46,016
- What?
- Your opponent, Miss Annie Oakley.

233
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,715
What do you mean?

234
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,725
Hey, Maclvor, is this your idea of a joke,

235
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:54,729
asking me to shoot against
a half-baked kid, and a girl at that?

236
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:57,561
Now, if you'd like to call off the bet...

237
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:59,897
He's right, Mr. Maclvor.

238
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:02,937
He'd look awful silly
if I beat him in front of all these folks.

239
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:05,496
Beat me! Why, you...

240
00:17:05,574 --> 00:17:08,270
Get those targets ready. Beat me!

241
00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:10,641
Make him earn his money, Annie.

242
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:15,045
I was wondering, Mr. Maclvor,

243
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,245
if you could help me find
some plain sewing?

244
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:24,054
Well, I don't know about needlework,
but I've got a cigar stand at the hotel...

245
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,754
Oh, I love a man who smokes a cigar.

246
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:32,359
Mind you,
the job only calls for selling cigars.

247
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:37,566
As the challenger, you shoot first.
Start with the end target.

248
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,833
Yes, sir.

249
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:40,772
Clear the range, boys.

250
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,907
All right.

251
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:53,850
You started at the wrong end.

252
00:17:53,922 --> 00:17:57,050
- That's all right. Set it up again.
- Set them up.

253
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:01,086
First potshot I ever took.

254
00:18:02,931 --> 00:18:04,796
All right, Mr. Walker.

255
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:13,366
This is too easy.
Give us something to shoot at.

256
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:17,173
Certainly. We'll use moving targets
if it's agreeable with Miss Oakley.

257
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:20,215
Well, I never shot a quail
while it was sitting down.

258
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,778
All right, miss.

259
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,614
Get in the pit, boys.

260
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:29,153
You'll shoot alternately.
The first one to miss will lose the contest.

261
00:18:29,224 --> 00:18:30,782
- Is that all right with you?
- Yes.

262
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,724
- And you, Mr. Walker?
- Fine.

263
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:34,262
And you, Mr. Maclvor?

264
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:37,258
It's fine with me.

265
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,494
Just call "Ready."

266
00:18:46,508 --> 00:18:48,032
- Ready.
- Throw!

267
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,974
A hit!

268
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:54,146
Good shot.

269
00:18:57,853 --> 00:19:00,879
- That was well done, little lady.
- Thank you, sir.

270
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:03,184
- Ready.
- Throw!

271
00:19:06,461 --> 00:19:07,758
A hit.

272
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,229
Good shot.

273
00:19:14,837 --> 00:19:16,395
- Ready.
- Throw!

274
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:19,235
A hit.

275
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:21,670
- Ready.
- Throw!

276
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:25,446
- Ready.
- Throw!

277
00:19:28,483 --> 00:19:30,417
- Ready.
- Throw!

278
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,985
- Ready.
- Throw!

279
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:41,062
Hey, Hogarth,
you signed up the wrong shooter.

280
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:47,795
You better look for another job, Toby.
There goes your championship.

281
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:50,663
- Ready.
- Throw!

282
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:56,143
Hogarth, you better get that contract
back, in case the girl beats Toby.

283
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:01,377
So, you're the champ!

284
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,942
Quiet, please, gentlemen.

285
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,183
Ready, Miss Oakley?

286
00:20:08,357 --> 00:20:10,825
Honey, I hope
you ain't gonna be the cause

287
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:13,020
of that young man losing his position.

288
00:20:13,095 --> 00:20:15,529
Don't worry, Ma. I ain't gonna be.

289
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,436
- Ready.
- Throw!

290
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,572
A miss!

291
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,521
- Ready.
- Throw!

292
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:48,890
A hit!

293
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:57,294
Sister, don't take it too much to heart.

294
00:20:57,372 --> 00:21:00,398
You gave me about as good a match
as anybody does.

295
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:01,840
Thanks, Mr. Walker.

296
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,901
You know, you've got possibilities.

297
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:06,948
It's too bad I won't be around
to give you a few pointers.

298
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:13,712
Come on, Ma, let's go home.

299
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:21,454
Everybody! Everybody up to the bar!
The drinks are on me!

300
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,738
All right, Fritz, it's on me.
Beers for everybody.

301
00:21:36,812 --> 00:21:40,908
- Make mine a champagne cocktail.
- I'll have champagne, too!

302
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:59,929
I don't see how she could have lost.

303
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:07,469
Newt said she tied him shot for shot
right up till the very last.

304
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:11,308
I never knew her to miss a shot before.

305
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,871
You'd better break the news
to them, Annie.

306
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,382
I'll keep an eye on the young'uns.

307
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,459
Hello, Annie.

308
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:13,501
- Howdy, Annie.
- Good evening.

309
00:23:15,277 --> 00:23:17,211
I'm gonna pay you folks back
the money I lost

310
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:19,304
if it takes a whole winter's shooting.

311
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:22,214
Oh, forget it, Annie.
You done the best you could.

312
00:23:22,284 --> 00:23:25,117
- Sure you did.
- You bet.

313
00:23:25,187 --> 00:23:27,155
That's just it, I didn't.

314
00:23:27,222 --> 00:23:31,181
Now, Annie,
you don't know what you're saying.

315
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:33,921
I know, all right, and I'm gonna fess up.

316
00:23:34,596 --> 00:23:36,621
I missed that last shot a purpose.

317
00:23:36,698 --> 00:23:39,064
You missed it a purpose!

318
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:40,601
Yes, I did.

319
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:46,833
I couldn't beat that fellow.
I didn't have the heart to.

320
00:23:47,476 --> 00:23:48,738
He was...

321
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:51,344
He was just too pretty.

322
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,286
- Hello, Miss Oakley.
- Hello.

323
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,828
Mrs. Oakley. You know,
in all the excitement,

324
00:24:07,896 --> 00:24:10,626
I completely forgot
to get that bet of yours covered.

325
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,327
When I remembered,
I had to chase all this way to find you.

326
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:15,926
- Honest, you didn't bet the money?
- No, I didn't.

327
00:24:16,004 --> 00:24:17,733
Gee, now, I can pay back the boys.

328
00:24:17,806 --> 00:24:20,741
Just a minute. There's something else
I wanted to see you about.

329
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:24,472
Mrs. Oakley, this daughter of yours
is one of the finest shots I've ever seen.

330
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,070
We're mighty proud of her.

331
00:24:26,148 --> 00:24:28,912
And we'd be mighty proud
to have her with the Buffalo Bill show.

332
00:24:28,984 --> 00:24:30,315
Buffalo Bill?

333
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,319
Yes, you see,
I'm a partner of Colonel Cody's.

334
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:35,823
Well, I hope you ain't suggesting that
Annie go gallivanting around the country

335
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,155
with a lot of cowboys and wild Injuns.

336
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,921
Well, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Annie?

337
00:24:39,995 --> 00:24:41,929
But what would Ma and the kids
do without me?

338
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:43,692
We'd pay you good money.

339
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:47,861
Just think of it, Annie Oakley
in the greatest shooting act in the country,

340
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:50,404
billed right next to Toby Walker.

341
00:24:50,472 --> 00:24:52,599
You don't mean he's going to be there.

342
00:24:52,674 --> 00:24:55,802
Every day for the next two years,
rain or shine.

343
00:24:56,478 --> 00:24:58,275
Mister, it's a deal.

344
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:38,144
Reckon the first thing
you'd better know about this outfit

345
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,778
is how I figure on running it.

346
00:25:39,854 --> 00:25:42,186
This is a real Wild West show

347
00:25:42,257 --> 00:25:45,021
with he-men doing the things
they did on the plains.

348
00:25:45,093 --> 00:25:48,153
Now, if you're carrying
any sleight of hand up your sleeve,

349
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,492
you'd better forget it.

350
00:25:49,564 --> 00:25:53,261
I want the real, genuine article or nothing.

351
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:55,132
That's what you're getting, Colonel.

352
00:25:55,203 --> 00:25:58,138
And, naturally, I expect to get billed
right up there on top.

353
00:25:58,206 --> 00:25:59,696
I don't suppose you'd mind, Walker,

354
00:25:59,774 --> 00:26:02,368
if we put Buffalo Bill's name
on the posters, too.

355
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:04,935
Oh, I think that'd be all right.

356
00:26:05,013 --> 00:26:08,244
No hard feelings, Colonel,
just a little friendly chat.

357
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,408
What?

358
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,658
Now, you wait here
until I break the news to the Colonel.

359
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:24,494
- I hope he likes me.
- How could he help it?

360
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:33,366
Well, you old horse-thief.
About time you turned up.

361
00:26:33,441 --> 00:26:35,033
I'm sorry. I was a little delayed, Bill.

362
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,372
I should think you would be.

363
00:26:36,444 --> 00:26:40,005
Probably ashamed to show your face
after sending me that New York buckaroo.

364
00:26:40,081 --> 00:26:43,448
Who? Toby Walker?
Why, he's the greatest shot on earth.

365
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:46,681
With the exception, maybe,
of a gunslinger I've just signed up.

366
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:49,417
Another one? Well, what's his name?

367
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:52,726
- Annie.
- Annie?

368
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,856
What in tarnation do you think
we're running around here,

369
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,056
a danged burlesque?

370
00:26:57,132 --> 00:27:01,592
Calm yourself, Bill. Annie Oakley's
as good a shot as any man I ever saw.

371
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,002
Did I hear someone call my name?

372
00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:07,132
Colonel Cody, meet Miss Annie Oakley.

373
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,438
Well, dog my cats!

374
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,138
- How do, little missy?
- Howdy.

375
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,443
And, Bill,
she shoots as pretty as she looks.

376
00:27:14,516 --> 00:27:15,744
Maybe so,

377
00:27:15,817 --> 00:27:19,844
but I never knowed any woman could
shoot good enough to join this outfit.

378
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:23,755
They say you're a mighty fine shot
yourself, Mr. Buffalo Bill.

379
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:27,328
How much you got says I can't beat you?

380
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:30,956
Well, bust my buttons,
how much you got says you can?

381
00:27:31,032 --> 00:27:32,590
Say, now, hold on, wait a minute.

382
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,328
With a woman
who can outshoot most men,

383
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,597
why, she'd soon be
the greatest attraction in our show.

384
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:39,731
Maybe you're right.
But how would it look on the billing?

385
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:43,403
"Buffalo Bill's blood-curdling
Wild West show

386
00:27:43,478 --> 00:27:45,378
"with the dainty Annie Oakley."

387
00:27:46,481 --> 00:27:49,814
You know, Bill, you're a downright
chicken-liver when it comes to women.

388
00:27:49,884 --> 00:27:54,048
No, it ain't that, Jeff. It's...
Well, it's the boys.

389
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:56,056
To tell you the truth,

390
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:59,252
I ain't got the gumption
to go out there and tell them.

391
00:27:59,327 --> 00:28:01,022
Well, you leave that to me.

392
00:28:03,164 --> 00:28:06,622
Boys, now that we're all here...

393
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:12,629
What I mean is I've brought you
all together because...

394
00:28:12,707 --> 00:28:14,538
Well, you see...

395
00:28:15,977 --> 00:28:19,435
This is kind of in the nature
of an occasion and...

396
00:28:22,016 --> 00:28:23,449
And I...

397
00:28:28,022 --> 00:28:30,513
Well, boys, I want you to...

398
00:28:31,526 --> 00:28:33,460
I really want you to...

399
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,492
You tell them, Jeff. It was your idea.

400
00:28:37,565 --> 00:28:39,829
Well, I've got some good news
for you, boys.

401
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:42,426
The Colonel and I have decided
that what this outfit really needs

402
00:28:42,504 --> 00:28:44,165
is an uplifting influence.

403
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:46,503
And what could be more uplifting
than the presence among us

404
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:48,974
of a fine, high-minded little woman?

405
00:28:49,043 --> 00:28:50,977
Here she is, boys.

406
00:28:51,045 --> 00:28:54,742
The newest member of our happy family,
Miss Annie Oakley.

407
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:02,649
That's all, boys.

408
00:29:03,725 --> 00:29:06,523
- What could she do in a show like this?
- I don't like this, anyway.

409
00:29:06,594 --> 00:29:08,357
Well, I can get a job with Pawnee Bill.

410
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,057
What could a woman do
in a show like this?

411
00:29:10,131 --> 00:29:11,996
Come on, Annie.
I'll show you the papooses.

412
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:16,025
Yes, little missy,
we're all just one big, happy family.

413
00:29:18,273 --> 00:29:19,672
Here we are.

414
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:22,870
This way, missy.

415
00:29:32,987 --> 00:29:34,249
Perfume.

416
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,791
Dang it, you smell like Happy Minnie's
back in Omaha.

417
00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:47,127
The Colonel's had me out there
sleeping with the horses.

418
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:51,263
Judging from the turnout,
I guess you boys see the light.

419
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:54,331
All right, fellows, what do you say?

420
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:56,570
Howdy, Miss Oakley.

421
00:29:56,644 --> 00:29:59,477
Well, that sounds mighty good, boys.
Now, let me tell you something,

422
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:02,778
someday you're gonna be darn proud
to say you knew Annie Oakley.

423
00:30:02,851 --> 00:30:05,615
That's right. Take it from one who knows.

424
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,426
Miss Oakley, I want you to meet
that old scallywag, Ned Buntline,

425
00:30:16,498 --> 00:30:17,965
- my press agent.
- Howdy.

426
00:30:18,032 --> 00:30:19,624
Howdy, little lady.

427
00:30:19,701 --> 00:30:22,363
It's up to you to put her across, Ned.

428
00:30:28,877 --> 00:30:30,970
You might even write her
into one of those dime novels

429
00:30:31,045 --> 00:30:33,275
you write about the Colonel, there.

430
00:30:33,348 --> 00:30:35,816
Well, sure thing,
if it's all right with the Colonel.

431
00:30:35,884 --> 00:30:37,078
How's this?

432
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:38,550
When she was just a little tyke,

433
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,783
Bill, here, saved her
from Chief Sitting Bull's redskins.

434
00:30:41,856 --> 00:30:43,118
Sitting Bull?

435
00:30:43,191 --> 00:30:44,590
Why, sure thing, Colonel.

436
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:47,651
Sitting Bull's worth five cents
of any man's dime novel.

437
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:52,894
The papers say old Bull's in Washington,
calling on the great white father.

438
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:54,935
We've got to grab him, Jeff.

439
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:58,336
Great way to start our season
if we got him out the opening night.

440
00:30:58,406 --> 00:31:01,933
Not to see the show, to join the show.

441
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,274
Well, that's tall thinking, Bill.

442
00:31:04,345 --> 00:31:07,610
Why drag in a dirty Sioux
to mess up a good outfit?

443
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:10,207
He might forget himself
and saw off another massacre.

444
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:14,221
Surely Mr. Bull's learned some manners
since he chawed up General Custer.

445
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,756
Of course he has.

446
00:31:15,823 --> 00:31:19,122
Besides, folks will pay good money
to see him.

447
00:31:19,193 --> 00:31:20,751
Out in the woods, maybe,

448
00:31:20,828 --> 00:31:22,693
but as long as you play
these eastern spots,

449
00:31:22,764 --> 00:31:25,824
Toby Walker's the lad
who will pack your arena.

450
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:34,163
You can see for yourself, Annie, you're
in the safest possible neighborhood.

451
00:31:34,242 --> 00:31:36,710
That's where Major Buntline lives,

452
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:41,044
that's my tent,
right next to Colonel Cody's quarters,

453
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,842
and that's where you live.

454
00:31:46,588 --> 00:31:49,614
Oh, a chiffonier and flowers, too.

455
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:53,319
Oh, I do want to thank you for everything.

456
00:31:53,394 --> 00:31:55,328
Don't thank me.

457
00:31:55,396 --> 00:31:56,693
Mr. Hogarth, then.

458
00:31:56,764 --> 00:31:58,959
Well, I thought a few flowers might help.

459
00:31:59,033 --> 00:32:00,694
Oh, it's wonderful.

460
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,328
Good night, Annie. Sleep tight.

461
00:32:03,404 --> 00:32:05,167
Good night. Good night, Colonel.

462
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:06,968
Good night, Annie.

463
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:16,015
Hey, what's this?

464
00:32:19,754 --> 00:32:22,279
Hey, you. Razorback.

465
00:32:23,057 --> 00:32:25,025
What's eating you, Jeff?

466
00:32:25,426 --> 00:32:26,415
Listen...

467
00:32:30,732 --> 00:32:32,529
What's the matter?

468
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,661
Oh, nothing an old bullwhacker like you
would understand. Come on.

469
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:41,507
The main thing for you boys to remember
is never get discouraged.

470
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:45,108
Why, when I think about
how I started in that shooting gallery,

471
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:47,340
nothing seems impossible.

472
00:32:47,415 --> 00:32:48,712
Whenever the boss would go out,

473
00:32:48,783 --> 00:32:51,081
I'd just keep popping away
until finally I was...

474
00:32:51,152 --> 00:32:52,619
- The best there was.
- The best there was.

475
00:32:52,687 --> 00:32:54,814
Nope. The best there is.

476
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,187
Whereabouts was this shooting gallery?

477
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,492
The Bowery.

478
00:33:00,695 --> 00:33:02,822
- The Bowery!
- What do you know about that?

479
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,831
A Bowery cowboy.

480
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:08,130
Boys, I just had to make this jaunt

481
00:33:09,704 --> 00:33:12,434
to show you western monkeys
how to shoot.

482
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:17,236
That bronc's begging to be busted.

483
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,013
Hello, cowboy.

484
00:33:38,366 --> 00:33:40,197
Hey, what's going on, here?

485
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,566
A little change in the layout, Mr. Walker.

486
00:33:42,637 --> 00:33:45,470
Mr. Hogarth's fixed you a place
all by yourself.

487
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,168
The other side of the buffalo corral.

488
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,643
Well, now, ain't that thoughtful of him?

489
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:02,956
Well, maybe I shouldn't let them
buckaroos sleep close to these firearms.

490
00:34:03,658 --> 00:34:07,116
One of them might go off
and scare my little playmates.

491
00:34:14,368 --> 00:34:18,805
Mr. Walker, I've been thinking,

492
00:34:18,873 --> 00:34:21,433
I guess you thought I was sort of fresh
coming up to Cincinnati

493
00:34:21,509 --> 00:34:22,703
to shoot against you.

494
00:34:22,777 --> 00:34:25,837
Why, no, kid.
What put that idea in your noodle?

495
00:34:25,913 --> 00:34:26,971
Well, I don't know.

496
00:34:27,048 --> 00:34:30,074
You being Toby Walker
and famous and all that.

497
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:34,688
Say, there was the grandest picture of you
on the side of Lem Jordan's store.

498
00:34:34,756 --> 00:34:38,351
- Yeah, was it really good?
- Move on, there.

499
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,856
- Who are you talking to?
- Mr. Hogarth's orders.

500
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:45,228
- Nobody's to annoy Miss Oakley.
- What do you mean "annoy"?

501
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:48,325
Nobody ever accused me of annoying a gal
when I was talking to her.

502
00:34:48,402 --> 00:34:50,632
Them's the orders, Mr. Walker.

503
00:34:53,207 --> 00:34:56,973
Oh, Mr. Walker,
you know that time up in Cincinnati?

504
00:34:57,044 --> 00:34:59,604
- Yeah.
- I let you beat me.

505
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,193
That's it!

506
00:35:42,623 --> 00:35:44,989
How do you like that, Colonel?

507
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,492
Not bad, Walker.

508
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,052
A little harder than potshotting
a herd of buffalo, eh, Colonel?

509
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,894
Yeah, and almost as dangerous.

510
00:36:08,616 --> 00:36:10,447
Afraid she don't know how to sell it, Jeff.

511
00:36:10,518 --> 00:36:12,816
Well, she hasn't had a chance yet.

512
00:36:12,887 --> 00:36:14,855
Anyway, you don't see her missing,
do you?

513
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:18,085
No, but she's just a shooting machine.

514
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:20,559
No color to her work.

515
00:36:20,628 --> 00:36:24,724
I'll be as sorry as you are,
but I don't think she'll make the grade.

516
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,270
Gosh, that looks just like him.

517
00:36:38,346 --> 00:36:40,610
A little trick I was saving for next year,

518
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:42,706
but on account of the act
I'm doing is going so good,

519
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,250
I'm gonna pass it along to you.

520
00:36:44,318 --> 00:36:47,116
That's mighty fine of you, Toby.
And I can do it, too.

521
00:36:47,188 --> 00:36:51,352
Sure you can, and here's another one.
You take these and come on down here.

522
00:36:55,496 --> 00:36:56,554
This one's a pippin.

523
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,360
When I say ready,
you throw them up high.

524
00:36:58,432 --> 00:36:59,899
Both of them?

525
00:37:05,673 --> 00:37:07,038
Throw them.

526
00:37:16,584 --> 00:37:18,176
I'll bet I can do that, too.

527
00:37:18,252 --> 00:37:22,018
Of course. You can shoot as good as I can.
All you need is color, showmanship.

528
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:23,579
Let me try it.

529
00:37:48,983 --> 00:37:50,746
Oh, Colonel.

530
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:55,914
Get out of here,
you darned, sneaking coyotes.

531
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,582
Get out of here!

532
00:38:00,594 --> 00:38:02,755
Close, Colonel, but no cigar.

533
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:06,562
Here you are, Bill.

534
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,504
Dad bob it, Jeff. Why can't I get a haircut?

535
00:38:14,575 --> 00:38:16,805
Well, Bill, that mane of yours
is the biggest thing in the show.

536
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,606
You might as well have your head cut off.

537
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:20,544
What would the President
and the rest of the bigwigs say

538
00:38:20,614 --> 00:38:22,605
if you came out like a shorn Samson?

539
00:38:22,683 --> 00:38:26,175
And they're all here today, Bill.
Everybody that is anybody in Washington.

540
00:38:26,253 --> 00:38:29,279
That's fine. What about Sitting Bull?

541
00:38:29,357 --> 00:38:30,790
No cause for you to worry.

542
00:38:30,858 --> 00:38:33,952
Ned Buntline's got him out there
as big as life in a front box.

543
00:38:34,028 --> 00:38:36,519
Great, Jeff, that's great.

544
00:38:36,597 --> 00:38:39,157
Go ahead now and comb out your curls.

545
00:38:40,701 --> 00:38:44,364
Introducing Ogallala Slim

546
00:38:44,438 --> 00:38:48,431
and his band of bronco-busting,
bull-dogging cowboys.

547
00:39:09,163 --> 00:39:13,793
You'd like being with the show, Chief.
Travel all over.

548
00:39:13,868 --> 00:39:16,962
Maybe you'll join, too, Rain-in-the-Face.

549
00:39:17,038 --> 00:39:18,369
How old are you?

550
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,565
- Me?
- Yes.

551
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,040
- Ninety-four.
- A spring chicken.

552
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,666
Magnificent, huh?

553
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:46,486
Rain-in-the-Face, ask Chief Sitting Bull
how he likes the show.

554
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,330
What's his nibs saying?

555
00:40:54,401 --> 00:40:58,770
Bull said, "All show no good like that,
he go home."

556
00:41:03,777 --> 00:41:07,611
Thrilling feats of horsemanship
by Russian Cossacks.

557
00:42:23,057 --> 00:42:24,149
What was that?

558
00:42:24,225 --> 00:42:28,321
Bull say, "All show smell bad."

559
00:42:37,004 --> 00:42:38,437
Do you know something?

560
00:42:38,505 --> 00:42:40,234
The Colonel thinks
I'm not going to make good.

561
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,672
- Oh, I doubt...
- He really does.

562
00:42:41,742 --> 00:42:43,710
I can tell the way
he's been looking at me, lately.

563
00:42:43,777 --> 00:42:45,540
Listen, will you do like I showed you?

564
00:42:45,613 --> 00:42:46,944
I've been practicing.

565
00:42:47,014 --> 00:42:51,917
Introducing the world's greatest rifle shot,

566
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,716
Mr. Toby Walker.

567
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,189
Well, wait till you see this one.

568
00:43:40,267 --> 00:43:43,600
He's gonna shoot a two-bit piece
right out of that fellow's fingers.

569
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,884
- What's that?
- He said, "Not bad for paleface.

570
00:44:03,957 --> 00:44:05,652
"Bull can hit dime."

571
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:14,857
Introducing one of the country's
greatest woman rifle shots,

572
00:44:14,935 --> 00:44:18,200
Miss Annie Oakley.

573
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:32,418
Boys, throw up five.

574
00:44:33,821 --> 00:44:36,255
Five? You want to ruin
the only chance you've got?

575
00:44:36,323 --> 00:44:38,018
I can hit them.

576
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:41,823
Tell Bull I'll bet he hasn't any squaws
that can shoot.

577
00:44:50,337 --> 00:44:54,535
He don't want the squaw shoot,
he want the squaw cook.

578
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,177
All right.

579
00:45:20,401 --> 00:45:22,835
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Chief.
Wait a minute.

580
00:45:22,903 --> 00:45:25,929
Will you wait a minute?
Don't be scared, Annie.

581
00:45:26,006 --> 00:45:28,440
Bull is just trying to tell you
how scrumptious he thinks you are.

582
00:45:28,509 --> 00:45:31,205
Goodness, I thought I was a goner
until you grabbed him.

583
00:45:31,278 --> 00:45:33,178
What's the matter, Chief?

584
00:45:38,786 --> 00:45:41,914
Annie, Chief Sitting Bull
has just rechristened you lpawa,

585
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,684
that means "little sure shot."

586
00:45:43,757 --> 00:45:48,353
And now, a thrilling battle
between the Indians and the cowboys

587
00:45:48,429 --> 00:45:51,762
during an attack on the immigrant train.

588
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:57,993
He says if you'll do this every day,
he'll join the show.

589
00:45:58,071 --> 00:46:01,006
I certainly will if he won't do that again.

590
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:03,974
Chief, it's a bargain.

591
00:46:58,532 --> 00:47:01,433
Hey, pal, take it easy. This is all in fun.

592
00:47:09,441 --> 00:47:14,640
"Buffalo Bill's trusty rifle barked
and another redskin bit the dust.

593
00:47:14,713 --> 00:47:18,740
"Riding like the wind, he swept
from the ground the beautiful girl,

594
00:47:18,817 --> 00:47:22,116
"last survivor of the ill-fated wagon train.

595
00:47:22,187 --> 00:47:24,747
"He spurred his mustang to greater speed,

596
00:47:24,823 --> 00:47:28,782
"sending leaden messages of death
into the ranks of the foe,

597
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:34,594
"but the redskins, with fiendish screams,
still pursued him.

598
00:47:34,666 --> 00:47:39,968
"Little did the doughty plainsman realize
that this tiny prairie primrose

599
00:47:40,038 --> 00:47:43,974
"was one day to burgeon
into womanhood's fairest flower,

600
00:47:44,042 --> 00:47:46,067
"Annie Oakley."

601
00:47:46,144 --> 00:47:47,668
Ned, you're a genius.

602
00:47:47,746 --> 00:47:51,477
Fifty thousand people will be wanting
to see her after reading that.

603
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,017
You know what I'm gonna do?

604
00:47:53,085 --> 00:47:56,213
I'm gonna bill her right up,
name for name, with Toby Walker.

605
00:47:56,288 --> 00:47:57,312
Oh, Colonel.

606
00:47:57,389 --> 00:47:59,823
So, I'm gonna be aced
out of my own act, huh?

607
00:47:59,891 --> 00:48:01,290
Now, listen, Walker.

608
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,828
Colonel Cody and I
are still running this outfit.

609
00:48:03,895 --> 00:48:06,056
Since you're asking for it,
I may as well tell you something.

610
00:48:06,131 --> 00:48:08,656
When it comes to draw,
you're not quite the biggest thing out.

611
00:48:08,734 --> 00:48:12,101
No wonder, with everybody else
getting all the razzle-dazzle.

612
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:14,536
Taking a green kid
and billing her up even with me.

613
00:48:14,606 --> 00:48:15,903
Oh, now, please.

614
00:48:15,974 --> 00:48:19,000
Mr. Walker knows I wouldn't do anything
to hurt his chances.

615
00:48:19,077 --> 00:48:20,840
You? Hurt my chances?

616
00:48:20,912 --> 00:48:22,903
Not you or anybody else with this troupe.

617
00:48:22,981 --> 00:48:26,314
I'll still be headlining when the rest of you
are working in livery barns.

618
00:48:26,385 --> 00:48:29,445
- Just one big...
...happy family.

619
00:48:29,521 --> 00:48:31,989
Just a minute! Just a minute, Colonel!

620
00:48:32,057 --> 00:48:34,457
There's gold in this domestic crisis.

621
00:48:34,526 --> 00:48:36,551
I can see it on the billboards.

622
00:48:36,628 --> 00:48:39,324
"Toby Walker versus Annie Oakley.

623
00:48:39,398 --> 00:48:41,263
"Male against female.

624
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:46,600
"A titanic battle of the sexes
for the rifle championship of the world."

625
00:48:46,672 --> 00:48:50,608
Ned, you're the thinkingest horse thief
in history.

626
00:48:50,676 --> 00:48:54,043
Forty years in the business
and never lost a spangle.

627
00:48:54,846 --> 00:48:57,212
Darned if this don't call for a drink.

628
00:48:57,282 --> 00:48:59,375
Everybody back to my car.

629
00:48:59,451 --> 00:49:02,352
I'm going to break out
a bottle of Old Crow.

630
00:49:03,221 --> 00:49:04,745
I'm sorry, Toby.

631
00:49:04,823 --> 00:49:07,087
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be with the show.

632
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:10,185
I don't take it personal, kid.
Business is business.

633
00:49:10,262 --> 00:49:13,891
Besides, I enjoy a brush with them
hairy-pantsers, once in a while.

634
00:49:13,965 --> 00:49:16,559
Don't you worry. You're aces with me.

635
00:50:00,679 --> 00:50:03,705
- Mad, Toby?
- No.

636
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:07,276
You're looking kind of mad.

637
00:50:08,386 --> 00:50:11,878
Got on a new rig, ain't you?
Sure looks pretty.

638
00:50:13,458 --> 00:50:16,916
- Gosh, it's funny how things turn out.
- Ain't it, though?

639
00:50:16,995 --> 00:50:20,158
It seems like only yesterday
I saw your picture on the billboard

640
00:50:20,232 --> 00:50:22,723
and Lem Jordan wanted to tear it down.

641
00:50:22,801 --> 00:50:24,462
Why, the fellow must have been crazy.

642
00:50:24,536 --> 00:50:26,595
He wanted to but I wouldn't let him.

643
00:50:28,273 --> 00:50:30,138
Well, it's a funny world.

644
00:50:30,208 --> 00:50:34,736
You looking at my picture on the billboard
and thinking I was so gosh-darn grand,

645
00:50:34,813 --> 00:50:36,303
and now you...

646
00:50:37,249 --> 00:50:39,114
Now you really got me.

647
00:50:41,353 --> 00:50:44,288
- I got you?
- You sure have, Annie.

648
00:50:44,356 --> 00:50:46,290
No other girl's got a chance.

649
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:49,526
But look we...

650
00:50:52,964 --> 00:50:56,559
Look, we can't let anybody know
we're stuck on each other.

651
00:50:56,635 --> 00:51:00,435
It's good show business if we even
let the company think we're unfriendly,

652
00:51:00,505 --> 00:51:03,338
- pretty near enemies.
- Oh.

653
00:51:03,408 --> 00:51:04,807
You think so?

654
00:51:04,876 --> 00:51:06,605
I know the ins and outs, kid.

655
00:51:06,678 --> 00:51:09,613
People will pay to see us
battle each other.

656
00:51:09,681 --> 00:51:12,707
I don't care no more
who wins those matches.

657
00:51:12,784 --> 00:51:14,911
- You don't?
- No.

658
00:51:14,986 --> 00:51:17,921
I know you can beat me
and I'm proud of you.

659
00:51:18,623 --> 00:51:21,456
Never thought I'd see the day
when I could stand that, but now...

660
00:51:21,526 --> 00:51:26,054
Toby, I'm gonna tell everybody
how wonderful you really are.

661
00:51:26,131 --> 00:51:29,157
Honey, we've got to give the folks
who think we hate each other

662
00:51:29,234 --> 00:51:30,997
a run for their money.

663
00:51:31,069 --> 00:51:34,038
Now, remember, you hate me.

664
00:51:34,105 --> 00:51:37,563
Mister, I hate you to pieces.

665
00:51:58,396 --> 00:52:01,763
- Hello, Lem.
- I got no time for you today.

666
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:03,232
Just leaving.

667
00:52:06,972 --> 00:52:08,564
Looks like the whole township's leaving.

668
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,871
- What's going on? Lmmigrating west?
- Immigrating nothing.

669
00:52:11,943 --> 00:52:15,242
We're going to Cincinnati to see the gal
that's making this county famous.

670
00:52:50,015 --> 00:52:52,677
Now I know why they call him Sitting Bull.

671
00:52:58,757 --> 00:53:01,419
I guess he wants us to share the sofa.

672
00:53:07,999 --> 00:53:09,591
Thank you, Chief.

673
00:53:17,809 --> 00:53:19,572
Positively, Chief.

674
00:53:19,644 --> 00:53:21,635
He says you'd make a fine squaw.

675
00:53:21,713 --> 00:53:25,945
You may know pretty near everything,
Toby Walker, but not Indian talk.

676
00:53:26,017 --> 00:53:29,783
Anything nice about you, honey,
I'd understand in any lingo.

677
00:53:34,726 --> 00:53:37,320
Toby, your tepee.

678
00:53:46,271 --> 00:53:48,364
Annie, your tepee.

679
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,807
I savvy.
Two can live in tepee cheap as one.

680
00:53:58,883 --> 00:54:00,214
Look.

681
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,358
Papooses good, too.

682
00:54:15,266 --> 00:54:17,666
Hey, hey, hey, Bull. Take it easy.

683
00:54:23,308 --> 00:54:25,299
That's the best I've heard in two weeks.

684
00:54:25,377 --> 00:54:27,902
Mr. Maclvor, how are you?

685
00:54:27,979 --> 00:54:31,244
Well, well, how fine you're looking, Annie.

686
00:54:31,316 --> 00:54:32,806
She hasn't changed much, has she, Mac?

687
00:54:32,884 --> 00:54:35,250
Considering the fact that she's become
a very famous young lady.

688
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,584
- And didn't I invent her?
- Sure you did.

689
00:54:37,655 --> 00:54:41,182
If it wasn't for you, I'd still be
quail-shooting down on the farm.

690
00:54:41,259 --> 00:54:44,160
And now, Mac, I want you to meet
a new member of our family,

691
00:54:44,229 --> 00:54:46,459
the one and only Sitting Bull.

692
00:54:49,434 --> 00:54:53,370
Well, you won't need that tent, Mr. Bull,
not while you're in Cincinnati.

693
00:54:53,438 --> 00:54:56,032
Yes, Mac's invited us all to stay
at his hotel while we're here.

694
00:54:56,107 --> 00:54:57,369
Oh, how nice.

695
00:54:57,442 --> 00:54:59,842
We're advertising for the Maclvor House.

696
00:54:59,911 --> 00:55:02,880
There'll be customers sleeping
on the billiard tables.

697
00:55:02,947 --> 00:55:05,848
Gosh, it'll be great
sleeping under a ceiling again.

698
00:55:05,917 --> 00:55:08,181
Ever since I joined
this hairy-pants outfit, I...

699
00:55:08,253 --> 00:55:13,020
Walker, if you can't say something
pleasant, just don't say nothing at all.

700
00:55:13,091 --> 00:55:15,218
I just told this little squirt a thing or two.

701
00:55:15,293 --> 00:55:18,353
I'm getting sick and tired of pulling
my shots just to make her look good.

702
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:19,954
Pulling your shots?

703
00:55:20,031 --> 00:55:23,523
Walker, one of these days
somebody's gonna bust that gas bag

704
00:55:23,601 --> 00:55:25,000
you call your head.

705
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:27,436
Better cowboys than you
have tried it, Colonel.

706
00:55:27,505 --> 00:55:31,566
Why, you lowdown,
yapping Bowery puppy.

707
00:55:31,643 --> 00:55:35,204
What this happy family needs
is a good spanking. Come on.

708
00:55:44,122 --> 00:55:46,989
Come on, Bull,
we'll get your stuff together.

709
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:51,255
Now, just a minute, gentlemen.

710
00:55:52,664 --> 00:55:55,656
- Where do you keep them Indians?
- Well, the Indian village is right over there.

711
00:55:55,733 --> 00:55:59,100
In fact, if you'll hurry,
you'll find Sitting Bull right at home.

712
00:56:02,807 --> 00:56:05,469
They'll dig him a new home
when I get through with him.

713
00:56:05,543 --> 00:56:08,671
Forget it, Dan.
Them Indian wars are all over.

714
00:56:08,746 --> 00:56:10,236
Let me alone.

715
00:56:10,815 --> 00:56:14,911
I ain't forgetting that I had a brother
with Custer at Little Big Horn.

716
00:56:24,596 --> 00:56:27,963
Now, you Sioux snake, I'm gonna pay you
for one of Custer's boys.

717
00:56:53,591 --> 00:56:54,956
Call them off.

718
00:57:02,534 --> 00:57:04,399
You all right, partner?

719
00:57:05,136 --> 00:57:08,537
A little scrap now and then
means nothing to you, eh, Bull?

720
00:57:10,675 --> 00:57:14,805
Gosh, I wouldn't have wanted that blast
much closer to my peepers.

721
00:57:15,246 --> 00:57:19,080
Well, come on, kid, I'll flag a hansom and
ship you off to a bulletproof hotel room.

722
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:35,827
Well, young man, it's not as bad
as it might have been.

723
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,197
Come on, come on, Doc. How about it?

724
00:57:37,268 --> 00:57:40,260
You're suffering
from a form of corneal opacity.

725
00:57:40,338 --> 00:57:41,566
You don't say.

726
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:46,008
A compressed condition
of the optic membrane, but don't worry.

727
00:57:46,077 --> 00:57:49,478
- You'll be able to see reasonably well.
- Oh, sure, I can see.

728
00:57:49,547 --> 00:57:51,412
Come in and see me again tomorrow.

729
00:57:51,482 --> 00:57:54,315
In the meantime, go easy with those eyes.

730
00:58:00,325 --> 00:58:01,952
What business are you in?

731
00:58:02,026 --> 00:58:05,985
- Me? I'm Toby Walker.
- That doesn't answer my question.

732
00:58:06,864 --> 00:58:09,298
I can see you're not
a patron of the theater, Doc.

733
00:58:09,367 --> 00:58:11,995
- I'm an actor.
- Oh, an actor.

734
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:15,528
Well, you'll be able to go on
with your work all right.

735
00:58:16,307 --> 00:58:19,174
- It's lucky you're not a bookkeeper.
- Yeah.

736
00:58:27,819 --> 00:58:30,413
- Toby, darling.
- Well, well, Vera.

737
00:58:31,889 --> 00:58:34,585
You sure look elegant back there
with all them explosive stogies.

738
00:58:34,659 --> 00:58:36,183
You don't look pekid yourself.

739
00:58:36,261 --> 00:58:38,024
Oh, I'm all right, I guess.

740
00:58:38,096 --> 00:58:39,893
It was nice of Mac
to give you the job here.

741
00:58:39,964 --> 00:58:41,761
Oh, he didn't lose nothing by it.

742
00:58:41,833 --> 00:58:44,768
The smoke business has perked up some
since I took over.

743
00:58:45,837 --> 00:58:47,862
Say, tonight's my night off.

744
00:58:47,939 --> 00:58:51,033
How about a little supper after the show,
just for old times' sake?

745
00:58:51,109 --> 00:58:55,876
Well, I'd like to, Vera, but I've got
a little business to attend to this evening.

746
00:58:57,882 --> 00:59:00,578
Is that the little business over there?

747
00:59:06,224 --> 00:59:12,322
Tell me, Annie,
is it true them Injuns eat D-O-G?

748
00:59:12,397 --> 00:59:15,696
Oh, I know what that spells.
That spells "dog."

749
00:59:19,304 --> 00:59:21,067
Hey, I'll see you later.

750
00:59:21,973 --> 00:59:23,770
Do they, Annie?

751
00:59:23,841 --> 00:59:25,399
Well, I don't think so.

752
00:59:25,476 --> 00:59:28,968
Mr. Sitting Bull just loves hash.
He likes it with molasses.

753
00:59:30,481 --> 00:59:32,210
Oh, here's Toby.

754
00:59:32,283 --> 00:59:34,581
Mr. Walker,
I want you to meet my mother

755
00:59:34,652 --> 00:59:36,244
and all the folks from down home.

756
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:39,552
Mrs. Oakley, folks,
I'm delighted to meet you.

757
00:59:39,624 --> 00:59:41,148
Mac, have you seen the Colonel?

758
00:59:41,225 --> 00:59:44,854
The last I saw of him, he and Mr. Hogarth
were busy sending telegrams.

759
00:59:44,929 --> 00:59:48,160
- Try and locate him for me, will you?
- Aye.

760
00:59:48,232 --> 00:59:51,759
Well, Mr. Walker, I reckon
you ain't gonna win so easy tonight

761
00:59:51,836 --> 00:59:53,929
as you did the last time you shot here.

762
00:59:54,005 --> 00:59:55,233
That's right.

763
00:59:55,306 --> 00:59:58,571
Annie's had a chance
to get used to his good looks.

764
01:00:00,411 --> 01:00:02,641
I'm sure you'll see her at her best tonight.

765
01:00:02,714 --> 01:00:04,443
And how about you, Mr. Walker?

766
01:00:04,515 --> 01:00:08,383
You know, Annie is a show all by herself.
She don't need me at all.

767
01:00:08,453 --> 01:00:12,719
- You see, folks what I mean...
- You ain't getting cold feet, are you?

768
01:00:13,691 --> 01:00:15,989
You mustn't mind the folks, Toby.

769
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:18,824
They're up here
from down home to see me,

770
01:00:18,896 --> 01:00:20,727
just like if we were playing New York,

771
01:00:20,798 --> 01:00:23,767
all the people from the Bowery
would come to see you.

772
01:00:23,835 --> 01:00:26,929
And we aren't going to disappoint them,
are we?

773
01:00:27,372 --> 01:00:30,034
Well, Walker, what's on your mind?

774
01:00:31,576 --> 01:00:34,568
I'm sorry I bothered you, Colonel.

775
01:00:34,645 --> 01:00:38,274
I guess what I wanted to say
just sort of slipped my mind.

776
01:00:43,721 --> 01:00:45,985
Fresh buttered popcorn?
A bag of popcorn, sir?

777
01:00:46,057 --> 01:00:47,957
It's very bad for you.

778
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:58,901
Step lively, folks.
Count your change before leaving.

779
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:00,699
Thank you, neighbor.

780
01:01:01,305 --> 01:01:04,365
Step lively, please,
and see the big performance,

781
01:01:04,475 --> 01:01:08,673
the big show, Wild West show,
a congress of rough riders.

782
01:01:08,746 --> 01:01:11,874
- Get tickets. How many, neighbor?
- How much are they?

783
01:01:11,949 --> 01:01:13,473
One dollar and a half, sir.

784
01:01:13,551 --> 01:01:16,418
- Have you any dollars?
- We have dollar tickets. Yes, sir.

785
01:01:16,487 --> 01:01:17,852
How many?

786
01:01:23,694 --> 01:01:26,458
You're keeping 11,000 people
from seeing the show.

787
01:01:26,531 --> 01:01:27,725
Aye.

788
01:01:29,066 --> 01:01:31,830
You know, Vera,
the more I think about this...

789
01:01:31,903 --> 01:01:33,165
Now, it isn't the money,

790
01:01:33,237 --> 01:01:35,899
it's poor Colonel Cody's feelings
I'm thinking about.

791
01:01:35,973 --> 01:01:38,373
Why, he'd be all broken up
if I paid for the tickets.

792
01:01:38,443 --> 01:01:40,968
Yeah, the shock would probably floor him.

793
01:01:41,045 --> 01:01:44,776
- Well, make up your mind.
- Step lively, please. Step lively, folks.

794
01:01:44,849 --> 01:01:47,579
- How many, neighbor?
- Well...

795
01:01:50,555 --> 01:01:52,045
Give me...

796
01:01:52,123 --> 01:01:56,025
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

797
01:01:56,093 --> 01:01:59,824
Your money's bogus around here, Mac.
Don't you know that?

798
01:01:59,897 --> 01:02:03,333
- I didn't know it was you.
- Give me a couple of blues.

799
01:02:09,207 --> 01:02:12,938
Here we are, my friends.
A couple of Annie Oakleys.

800
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:14,307
Step lively, folks.

801
01:02:14,846 --> 01:02:17,781
Annie Oakleys.
Oh, that's a bonny name for them.

802
01:02:17,849 --> 01:02:21,307
Two holes, and clean
as Annie might have shot them herself.

803
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,948
Just a minute. This is hardly right.

804
01:02:25,022 --> 01:02:29,015
- Oh, go on, go on.
- Well, if you insist.

805
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,747
Miss Annie Oakley, the winner.

806
01:03:02,193 --> 01:03:07,187
I am sure Miss Oakley
will favor us with an encore.

807
01:03:10,368 --> 01:03:13,030
Is there any brave gentleman
in the audience

808
01:03:13,104 --> 01:03:17,973
who would like to have Miss Oakley shoot
a cigarette from his mouth at 30 paces?

809
01:03:27,351 --> 01:03:28,750
I'll do it.

810
01:03:30,087 --> 01:03:36,048
Ladies and gentlemen,
proving chivalry is not dead,

811
01:03:36,127 --> 01:03:42,123
Mr. Toby Walker will show his faith
in the marksmanship

812
01:03:42,199 --> 01:03:43,996
of his fair opponent.

813
01:03:46,037 --> 01:03:48,267
I wish I was making that shot.

814
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:08,518
Give me a coin. I'll hold it for Toby.

815
01:04:11,596 --> 01:04:13,723
Ladies and gentlemen,

816
01:04:13,798 --> 01:04:17,734
the courage of the fair sex
is a match to that of the male.

817
01:04:17,802 --> 01:04:22,603
The little lady will now permit
Mr. Toby Walker to shoot a 25-cent piece

818
01:04:22,673 --> 01:04:26,837
out of her hand at the same distance,
30 paces.

819
01:04:26,911 --> 01:04:29,778
Since when did you take over
setting my routines?

820
01:04:29,847 --> 01:04:32,680
- Why I only thought...
- You're paid to jabber, not to think.

821
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:36,846
My contract don't call for carrying out
your half-wit brainstorms.

822
01:04:40,358 --> 01:04:46,763
Sorry, friends, but Mr. Walker seems
indisposed to accept the challenge.

823
01:04:46,831 --> 01:04:48,765
Oh, he's scared he'll miss.

824
01:04:48,833 --> 01:04:50,926
Indisposed nothing. He's afraid.

825
01:04:51,002 --> 01:04:53,562
Yeah, he's afraid she'll beat him.

826
01:04:53,638 --> 01:04:57,699
I always did say he didn't have any nerve.
He's trying to queer Annie's act.

827
01:04:57,775 --> 01:04:59,902
What's the matter with you,
trying to start a stampede?

828
01:04:59,977 --> 01:05:01,808
Oh, just having a little fun with him,
Mr. Hogarth.

829
01:05:01,879 --> 01:05:04,143
He's got it coming to him.
Any fellow that chicken-livered...

830
01:05:04,215 --> 01:05:06,775
Shut up.
I ought to fire the whole lot of you.

831
01:05:06,851 --> 01:05:10,309
He could do it easy.
He's just trying to queer the show.

832
01:05:11,389 --> 01:05:14,654
He's got a yellow streak
down his back a yard wide.

833
01:05:48,025 --> 01:05:49,788
He aimed to hit her.

834
01:05:52,897 --> 01:05:56,924
- Annie!
- Walker, I ought to kill you right here.

835
01:05:57,001 --> 01:05:59,094
There, now, honey. We'll have a doctor
for you in just a second.

836
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:00,262
Oh, I'm all right.

837
01:06:00,337 --> 01:06:02,134
Bring on the next act!

838
01:06:02,206 --> 01:06:03,400
Honest, Colonel, I tried...

839
01:06:03,474 --> 01:06:06,034
Walker, I'm giving you 10 minutes
to pack up and get off the grounds.

840
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:08,203
That suits me fine,
but first I'm gonna see Annie.

841
01:06:08,279 --> 01:06:09,837
She don't want no part of you.

842
01:06:11,849 --> 01:06:14,010
This is my fault. I should have
thrown him out a long time ago.

843
01:06:14,085 --> 01:06:15,609
He didn't mean to do it. I know he didn't.

844
01:06:15,686 --> 01:06:17,586
Oh, yes, he did. He deliberately hit you
in the shooting hand.

845
01:06:17,655 --> 01:06:20,624
Oh, he wouldn't try to hurt anybody.
You don't understand him.

846
01:06:20,691 --> 01:06:22,818
Rustle him out of here, boys.

847
01:06:24,528 --> 01:06:26,860
- I've got to see him.
- Come on, Annie, we'll see the doctor.

848
01:06:26,931 --> 01:06:31,061
Presenting riders of all nations in review.

849
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:52,312
- Well, Doctor, what's the verdict?
- No tendons severed. She'll be all right.

850
01:06:52,389 --> 01:06:54,516
- To shoot?
- Oh, yes, it's not really serious

851
01:06:54,592 --> 01:06:56,617
if she takes care of her hand
for a few weeks.

852
01:06:56,694 --> 01:06:59,322
Better let Annie rest now, folks.

853
01:06:59,396 --> 01:07:02,593
Please stop fussing over me
and tell me where Toby is.

854
01:07:02,666 --> 01:07:05,066
- Now, now, now, now.
- You children, run out in the hall and play.

855
01:07:05,136 --> 01:07:06,899
But I want him. Why isn't he here?

856
01:07:06,971 --> 01:07:09,439
You mustn't upset yourself, Miss Oakley.
Please try to rest.

857
01:07:09,507 --> 01:07:12,237
But I can't rest
until I find what's become of him.

858
01:07:12,309 --> 01:07:14,573
It doesn't hurt a bit anymore.

859
01:07:15,613 --> 01:07:17,342
You're all keeping him away from me.

860
01:07:17,414 --> 01:07:20,508
Now, honey, you mustn't have any
more truck with that...

861
01:07:20,584 --> 01:07:22,552
He didn't mean to do it.

862
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:25,183
He's sweet and kind.

863
01:07:26,891 --> 01:07:28,882
You don't understand him.

864
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:31,325
- None of you do.
- Annie, please.

865
01:07:31,395 --> 01:07:34,228
You never gave him a chance
from the first day you saw him.

866
01:07:34,298 --> 01:07:35,663
Well, I'll tell you something,

867
01:07:35,733 --> 01:07:38,531
he's better than the whole bunch of you
put together.

868
01:07:38,602 --> 01:07:40,797
There, there, precious,
everything will be all right.

869
01:07:40,871 --> 01:07:43,305
Now, don't you worry, little missy.

870
01:07:43,374 --> 01:07:47,435
We're going to have you right as rain
in just a few days.

871
01:07:47,511 --> 01:07:50,446
- Good night, Annie.
- Boys, if you don't mind.

872
01:07:52,183 --> 01:07:53,275
Bye.

873
01:07:55,319 --> 01:07:58,846
- You're gonna be fit as a fiddle, Annie.
- Good night, Annie.

874
01:07:58,923 --> 01:08:01,084
- Goodbye, doctor.
- Good night.

875
01:08:05,229 --> 01:08:07,094
There, there, baby.

876
01:08:07,164 --> 01:08:08,859
Try to get some sleep.

877
01:08:11,035 --> 01:08:13,697
I'll be along in a minute, Mrs. Oakley.

878
01:08:18,175 --> 01:08:22,771
It wasn't his fault. I know it wasn't.
If I could only talk to him.

879
01:08:22,847 --> 01:08:24,974
Annie, dear, you're just a kid.

880
01:08:25,049 --> 01:08:28,109
You've got to believe in the people
who really love you,

881
01:08:28,185 --> 01:08:30,745
and the sooner you forget about him,
the better.

882
01:08:30,821 --> 01:08:33,449
But I'm not going to forget about him.

883
01:08:34,792 --> 01:08:36,657
Try to get some sleep.

884
01:08:44,101 --> 01:08:45,625
Toby!

885
01:08:45,703 --> 01:08:49,662
Honey, your hand, honest, I...

886
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:53,005
It's nothing.
Nothing, now that you're here.

887
01:08:53,077 --> 01:08:54,874
They're saying I done it on purpose.

888
01:08:54,945 --> 01:08:56,378
There's something
I've got to tell you, Annie.

889
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:58,415
- You've said enough already, Walker.
- Please, Jeff.

890
01:08:58,482 --> 01:09:02,578
I'm sorry, Annie. You may hate me for this
but tonight he'll do his talking to me.

891
01:09:02,653 --> 01:09:04,883
I've got nothing to say to you, Hogarth.

892
01:09:04,955 --> 01:09:07,150
What did you want to tell me, Toby?

893
01:09:07,224 --> 01:09:08,782
The less you say, the better, Walker.

894
01:09:08,859 --> 01:09:12,454
But I've got something to tell you,
you're going to clear out of this kid's life.

895
01:09:12,529 --> 01:09:15,623
I see, trying to fix it up for yourself, huh?

896
01:09:15,699 --> 01:09:17,667
You know that isn't so.

897
01:09:17,735 --> 01:09:20,533
I think Annie knows that her happiness
is all that matters to me,

898
01:09:20,604 --> 01:09:22,765
to everybody in this show, except you.

899
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,273
What have you got to offer?

900
01:09:24,341 --> 01:09:27,777
A selfish, swelled head
and a future that's behind you.

901
01:09:31,081 --> 01:09:33,106
Maybe you're right.

902
01:09:33,183 --> 01:09:35,549
Toby, you know I don't believe that.

903
01:09:38,255 --> 01:09:39,984
- Goodbye.
- Toby!

904
01:09:41,892 --> 01:09:44,224
Now, now, now.

905
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:49,993
I'm going to run along
and let you get some rest.

906
01:09:50,935 --> 01:09:53,165
You mustn't be too hurt about this.

907
01:09:53,237 --> 01:09:57,037
You'll find that a fellow like that
is pretty easy to forget.

908
01:10:06,984 --> 01:10:10,249
Well, I guess
I'll let you get a little sleep, Chief.

909
01:10:13,223 --> 01:10:14,588
Good night.

910
01:10:19,763 --> 01:10:21,162
Good night.

911
01:10:56,367 --> 01:10:57,595
Come in.

912
01:11:01,271 --> 01:11:02,431
Hello.

913
01:11:04,808 --> 01:11:07,800
I thought you might need
a little cheering up.

914
01:11:08,545 --> 01:11:10,843
You're wasting your time, kid.

915
01:11:10,914 --> 01:11:13,781
The great Toby Walker is on the skids.

916
01:11:15,552 --> 01:11:18,020
Don't let them sell you that, Toby.

917
01:11:18,088 --> 01:11:20,283
Why, we could put
the old vaudeville act together again

918
01:11:20,357 --> 01:11:22,825
and play to standing room only.

919
01:11:22,893 --> 01:11:26,829
I'm all played out, Vera.
You've got a good job. Hang on to it.

920
01:11:26,897 --> 01:11:30,025
Oh, that. Listen, Toby,
what you need is a little romping.

921
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:32,933
I'm gonna take you out
and show you the town.

922
01:11:36,006 --> 01:11:37,371
Toby.

923
01:11:37,441 --> 01:11:41,935
Well, well, if it ain't little dead-eye.
Maybe you'd like to join us.

924
01:11:42,012 --> 01:11:45,004
We're just going out and paint the town.

925
01:11:45,082 --> 01:11:46,913
Toby, I've got to talk to you.

926
01:11:46,984 --> 01:11:50,181
Your friend Hogarth was right.
There's been enough said already.

927
01:11:50,254 --> 01:11:51,516
- But...
- Listen, dead-eye,

928
01:11:51,588 --> 01:11:53,453
why don't you quit pounding this man?

929
01:11:53,524 --> 01:11:55,389
You ain't done him
a nickel's worth of good.

930
01:11:55,459 --> 01:11:58,553
Ever since he first seen you, he's had
one piece of rotten luck after the other.

931
01:11:58,629 --> 01:12:00,028
- Vera!
- Ain't you satisfied

932
01:12:00,097 --> 01:12:02,793
with the way you got him messed up now?

933
01:12:18,549 --> 01:12:22,542
Just busting with the juices
of human kindness, ain't you?

934
01:12:22,619 --> 01:12:25,918
Well, I guess you helped me
do her a favor, at that.

935
01:12:27,224 --> 01:12:29,886
Well, so long, my little sugar plum.

936
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:33,623
So long?
I thought we was gonna paint the town.

937
01:12:33,697 --> 01:12:36,632
The Bill show's celebrating
with the rip-snortingest blowout

938
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:37,860
this old town's ever had.

939
01:12:37,935 --> 01:12:40,096
Bill, don't bother Annie tonight.
Wait and tell her in the morning.

940
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:42,934
Why, this will do her more good
than a barrel of medicine.

941
01:12:43,006 --> 01:12:44,701
Don't be such a bluenose, Jeff.

942
01:12:44,775 --> 01:12:47,437
You'd have the poor kid thinking
there wasn't no Santa Claus.

943
01:12:47,511 --> 01:12:49,911
Annie! Annie!

944
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:00,947
Well, missy, we've got great news
and you're gonna be the first to hear it.

945
01:13:01,024 --> 01:13:05,154
Buffalo Bill's Wild West show
with the one and only Annie Oakley

946
01:13:05,229 --> 01:13:07,891
is breaking camp for a tour of Europe.

947
01:13:08,465 --> 01:13:09,932
- Europe?
- That's right.

948
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,060
Why, Annie, you'll have kings and queens
throwing their crowns in the air.

949
01:13:13,137 --> 01:13:15,037
But right now,
you're gonna help us celebrate.

950
01:13:15,105 --> 01:13:16,766
Champagne for the boys,

951
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:19,934
but for Annie Oakley,
a big bottle of sarsaparilla.

952
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:22,774
- Come on, Annie.
- Would...

953
01:13:24,448 --> 01:13:27,611
Would you mind very much
if I didn't come to your party?

954
01:13:27,684 --> 01:13:31,279
Why, no, no. Of course we wouldn't mind.
Come on, Bill.

955
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:38,823
I guess I'm just an old blundering fool.

956
01:13:38,896 --> 01:13:42,457
- Your little hand. You must...
- My hand's all right.

957
01:13:42,866 --> 01:13:45,334
- Come on. Good night, Annie.
- Good night.

958
01:13:45,402 --> 01:13:47,165
Good night, missy.

959
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:41,189
What's this?

960
01:14:43,927 --> 01:14:45,952
- Here.
- Gas.

961
01:14:46,029 --> 01:14:47,553
- Chief!
- He's been shooting out the lights.

962
01:14:47,631 --> 01:14:50,566
- Of all the unmitigated nerve...
- What happened to you?

963
01:14:50,634 --> 01:14:53,159
All right, all right, all right.
Never mind, never mind.

964
01:14:53,237 --> 01:14:56,798
Don't you worry. Don't you worry, Mac.
I'll pay all the damage.

965
01:14:56,873 --> 01:14:59,273
The Chief can shoot up all the hotels
he wants tonight.

966
01:14:59,343 --> 01:15:02,176
We're celebrating, Mac. We're celebrating!

967
01:15:28,905 --> 01:15:32,534
Annie, you're to be presented
to the Czar and the Czarina.

968
01:15:33,877 --> 01:15:37,540
Your Majesty,
may I present to you Miss Oakley.

969
01:15:45,255 --> 01:15:47,815
Annie, I'm afraid you just never
will learn about crowned heads.

970
01:15:47,891 --> 01:15:49,916
You're supposed to always take
the gentleman's hand first,

971
01:15:49,993 --> 01:15:51,688
and kiss it, not shake it.

972
01:15:51,762 --> 01:15:54,026
And I shook hands first with the Czarina.

973
01:15:54,097 --> 01:15:55,724
Gosh, I suppose that was terrible.

974
01:15:55,799 --> 01:15:57,926
No, no, you were just yourself.

975
01:15:58,001 --> 01:15:59,901
That's why we all love you.

976
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:01,767
I love you all, too.

977
01:16:01,838 --> 01:16:06,275
Colonel Cody and Mr. Buntline
and Buck, Jim and Sam...

978
01:16:06,343 --> 01:16:09,801
Hey, now, wait a minute.
What about a fellow named Hogarth?

979
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:13,338
You're first on the list, Jeff.
I thought you knew that.

980
01:16:13,417 --> 01:16:16,284
First in the show or first everywhere?

981
01:16:17,321 --> 01:16:20,518
Annie, I know I'm not your idea
of something romantic,

982
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:24,583
but I can't help it if I love you,
if that counts for anything.

983
01:16:24,661 --> 01:16:28,961
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I see it all in the crystal ball.

984
01:16:30,634 --> 01:16:34,070
Madam, I see a blonde villain
hovering about you.

985
01:16:35,539 --> 01:16:38,531
He seems to have designs on your future.

986
01:16:38,608 --> 01:16:41,042
I see him pursuing you to Germany.

987
01:16:57,327 --> 01:17:00,194
Annie, His Highness Crown Prince Wilhelm
wants to ask you something.

988
01:17:00,263 --> 01:17:01,855
Is it true, <i>Frulein</i> Oakley,

989
01:17:01,932 --> 01:17:04,230
that you are able to shoot a cigarette
from a person's mouth?

990
01:17:04,301 --> 01:17:08,294
- Yes.
- Very well. You will shoot one from mine.

991
01:17:08,372 --> 01:17:11,068
But kindly do not muss the <i>Schnurrbart.</i>

992
01:17:17,547 --> 01:17:21,108
For heaven's sake, be careful, Annie.
This fellow has to be Kaiser some day.

993
01:17:21,184 --> 01:17:24,381
Gosh, an inch the wrong way
might change the history books.

994
01:17:28,425 --> 01:17:30,916
Oh, gosh,
that spring breeze smells wonderful.

995
01:17:30,994 --> 01:17:34,293
Madam, do you realize that at this
moment it's spring in New York, too?

996
01:17:34,364 --> 01:17:37,094
- I was thinking of that.
- Yeah.

997
01:17:37,167 --> 01:17:40,432
Just about this time a man
named Anson's come on from Chicago

998
01:17:40,504 --> 01:17:43,064
and hit at least four home runs,

999
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:46,075
the organ grinders
are tuning up their hurdy-gurdies,

1000
01:17:46,143 --> 01:17:49,010
the little girls are maypole dancing
in Central Park,

1001
01:17:49,079 --> 01:17:52,412
and the new bock beer
is foaming at Luchow's.

1002
01:17:52,482 --> 01:17:55,883
Every time they broach a keg, Annie,
they ring a gong.

1003
01:17:56,787 --> 01:17:58,914
That, my darling,
is when you know it is spring.

1004
01:17:58,989 --> 01:18:03,483
Gosh. And down home in Ohio,
the buds are coming out on the trees,

1005
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:07,223
and the bluebirds are wondering
why they ever went away.

1006
01:18:07,297 --> 01:18:11,563
I guess spring is the time to make
you think of far away and long ago.

1007
01:18:12,569 --> 01:18:16,972
It was spring the first time I went up
to Cincinnati to shoot against...

1008
01:18:19,142 --> 01:18:22,737
Cheer up, Annie,
you're not the only one who's homesick.

1009
01:18:22,813 --> 01:18:27,546
Why, dog my cats,
in exactly two weeks and four days,

1010
01:18:27,617 --> 01:18:32,145
the Buffalo Bill Wild West show will be
putting on the dad-bustedest parade

1011
01:18:32,222 --> 01:18:36,283
up Fifth Avenue that was ever gawked at
by man or critter.

1012
01:18:36,359 --> 01:18:38,691
I'm leaving the show
when we get to New York.

1013
01:18:38,762 --> 01:18:40,286
Annie.

1014
01:18:40,363 --> 01:18:42,388
Oh, I'm not happy, Jeff.

1015
01:18:44,501 --> 01:18:46,526
It's still Toby, isn't it?

1016
01:18:49,406 --> 01:18:53,308
I guess it's human nature to fight for
anything we love, isn't it, Annie?

1017
01:18:53,376 --> 01:18:55,241
I guess so.

1018
01:18:56,379 --> 01:18:58,404
But we don't always win.

1019
01:18:59,449 --> 01:19:01,417
No, we don't always win.

1020
01:19:08,458 --> 01:19:12,087
Here's something I should have given you
a long time ago.

1021
01:19:26,376 --> 01:19:28,276
Oh, I know
what you must be thinking of me.

1022
01:19:28,345 --> 01:19:32,304
Oh, I'm only thinking of one thing, Jeff.
We've got to find him.

1023
01:19:34,885 --> 01:19:36,147
We will.

1024
01:20:06,616 --> 01:20:10,643
Step right up, ladies and gents,
and take a lesson from the champ shot.

1025
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:14,622
Never beat in any contest anywhere
by any living man.

1026
01:20:20,263 --> 01:20:23,096
Say, Charlie, if the champ
is such a razzmatazz,

1027
01:20:23,166 --> 01:20:25,361
how come he don't never do no shooting?

1028
01:20:25,435 --> 01:20:27,460
It's the lamps, the lamps.

1029
01:20:34,578 --> 01:20:36,910
Holy gee! Annie Oakley.

1030
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:40,074
Gosh, and the Buffalo Bill show
is coming here next Monday.

1031
01:20:40,150 --> 01:20:42,914
Hey, mister, do you know Annie Oakley?

1032
01:20:45,322 --> 01:20:50,316
Son, I knew her way back when.

1033
01:20:50,393 --> 01:20:51,758
Sure, he knew them all.

1034
01:20:51,828 --> 01:20:55,127
Annie Oakley, Sarah Bernhardt,
Mrs. Astor's horse, Bessie...

1035
01:20:55,198 --> 01:20:56,392
Yeah, you...

1036
01:21:18,455 --> 01:21:24,826
Introducing a congress
of the world's roughest riders.

1037
01:21:24,894 --> 01:21:27,692
First, a group of Sioux Indians.

1038
01:21:27,764 --> 01:21:32,098
Next, Crow Indians, Cherokees,

1039
01:21:32,168 --> 01:21:37,538
Cheyenne, Blackfeet and Arapaho.

1040
01:21:37,607 --> 01:21:40,974
Cowboys from Montana, from Wyoming,

1041
01:21:41,044 --> 01:21:46,676
from Oklahoma Territory,
from Colorado, from Dakota.

1042
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:49,150
Mexicans from old Mexico,

1043
01:21:49,219 --> 01:21:52,552
Russian Cossacks
from the steppes of Russia

1044
01:21:52,622 --> 01:21:56,080
and the South American gauchos.

1045
01:21:56,159 --> 01:22:01,222
And a troop of the United States Cavalry.

1046
01:22:08,405 --> 01:22:14,867
And now, introducing Colonel W. F. Cody,

1047
01:22:14,944 --> 01:22:17,310
Buffalo Bill.

1048
01:22:31,161 --> 01:22:33,129
Well, dog my cats.

1049
01:22:35,899 --> 01:22:39,494
Annie, did you see that crowd?
Why, half of New York's out there tonight.

1050
01:22:39,569 --> 01:22:42,936
Do you think Toby might be out there?
Do you think he'd come?

1051
01:22:43,006 --> 01:22:45,167
Now, don't you worry
about finding him, honey.

1052
01:22:45,241 --> 01:22:49,109
Today, your Uncle Jeff took it on himself
to engage the Pinkertons to locate him.

1053
01:22:49,179 --> 01:22:50,237
Jeff, you're real.

1054
01:22:50,313 --> 01:22:57,242
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure
personally to introduce that little lady

1055
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:01,222
who has played
before all the crowned heads of Europe,

1056
01:23:01,291 --> 01:23:06,285
the greatest shooting star
the world has ever known,

1057
01:23:06,362 --> 01:23:07,795
Annie Oakley.

1058
01:23:24,047 --> 01:23:26,072
Can I borrow your glasses?

1059
01:23:38,428 --> 01:23:41,454
Wild West, are you ready?

1060
01:23:58,581 --> 01:24:03,314
Poor Little Sure Shot. She's always so sad.

1061
01:24:20,904 --> 01:24:25,967
We present that world-famous,
thrilling spectacle,

1062
01:24:26,042 --> 01:24:29,102
the Indian attack on the Deadwood stage,

1063
01:24:29,179 --> 01:24:35,584
featuring the one and only
Chief Sitting Bull.

1064
01:25:30,807 --> 01:25:33,571
Toby! Toby!

1065
01:26:55,224 --> 01:26:57,055
What's the matter? Couldn't you get in?

1066
01:26:57,126 --> 01:26:58,718
I saw all I wanted to see.

1067
01:26:58,795 --> 01:27:00,160
Well, that's fine.

1068
01:27:00,229 --> 01:27:04,029
Then you can help handle the trade,
of which there ain't none.

1069
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:04,421
Introducing an aggregation
of the outstanding horsemen of the world,

1070
01:28:04,494 --> 01:28:09,796
brought for your entertainment
from the four corners of the earth.

1071
01:28:09,866 --> 01:28:15,600
Military riders,
representative of all nations.

1072
01:28:17,306 --> 01:28:21,640
And last, the United States Cavalry.

1073
01:28:42,465 --> 01:28:44,365
Annie, I found Toby.

1074
01:28:44,434 --> 01:28:46,459
- Chief, where is he?
- Come quick.

1075
01:28:46,536 --> 01:28:48,333
I will take you.

1076
01:29:18,334 --> 01:29:21,895
Gee, Toby, did you honestly
know Annie Oakley?

1077
01:29:23,406 --> 01:29:24,703
Did I know her?

1078
01:29:24,774 --> 01:29:26,366
Did he know her?

1079
01:29:29,846 --> 01:29:31,905
Six shots for a dime, ten cents.

1080
01:29:31,981 --> 01:29:34,779
Step up and try your luck over here.
Here, over here.

1081
01:29:34,851 --> 01:29:37,718
But, Toby, we ain't got no dime.

1082
01:29:39,789 --> 01:29:41,120
All right.

1083
01:29:42,558 --> 01:29:44,526
Here you are.
You kids can have three apiece.

1084
01:29:44,594 --> 01:29:48,553
But hurry up before the boss gets back.
Let's see you hit something for a change.

1085
01:30:04,914 --> 01:30:06,108
Annie!

1086
01:30:06,682 --> 01:30:07,808
Toby!

1087
01:30:10,086 --> 01:30:11,781
Gosh, it's her!

1088
01:30:16,559 --> 01:30:18,720
Did I know Annie Oakley?

1089
01:30:27,537 --> 01:30:28,526
