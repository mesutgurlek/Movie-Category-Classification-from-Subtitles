1
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,398
Don't mean to be busting in on you...

2
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,378
but l couldn't help seeing your fire
from the ridge.

3
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,776
-What are you-
-You heard the gent.

4
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,812
He just stopped by
to get in out of the rain.

5
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,981
-Ain't that right?
-That's right.

6
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:10,514
Come on in.

7
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,826
Thanks.

8
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,665
l'd be obliged for a cup of that coffee.

9
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,228
-Help yourself.
-Thanks.

10
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,946
lt's a mighty wet night
for a man to be out.

11
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:39,985
Sure is.

12
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,157
You must have rode a long way.

13
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,860
l walked.

14
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,288
Ain't you got no horse?

15
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,492
Did have.

16
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,936
Chiricahua jumped me.
About 10 miles back.

17
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,498
-They stole him?
-They ate him.

18
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,917
Don't l know you
from somewhere, mister?

19
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,251
Ever been in Silver Springs?

20
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,953
Can't say as l have.

21
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,299
l come from there.

22
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,536
l hear there was a killing in Silver.

23
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,237
Yeah, l heard.

24
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,236
The rain's slacking off, Clint.
We better get moving before...

25
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:42,712
What's your hurry?

26
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,680
No close town around.

27
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,829
That killing...

28
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,302
they ever catch up to
them fellows that done it?

29
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:10,301
Two of them.

30
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,370
Giddap.

31
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,538
Here.

32
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,787
-Good morning.
-Yes, isn't it?

33
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,587
-Looks like you could use a little help.
-A lot of help, mister.

34
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,753
These poor animals are about worn out.
Not to mention us.

35
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:14,560
Oh, the name's Greer, John Greer.
And this is Annie, my wife.

36
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,037
Ma'am.

37
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:28,005
-Well, think we can get it out, Mister...
-Stride, Ben Stride.

38
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,339
Sun's going to dry this mud before long.

39
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,644
And, is that good?

40
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,081
-Like as not, it'll hard up like a rock.
-l see.

41
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,757
Look, Mr. Stride,
all l own is in this wagon.

42
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,159
l can't say that l'd like to make
this mudhole my home.

43
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:47,221
l sure would appreciate it if you'd get
up there and make these horses pull.

44
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,826
Get up there yourself.

45
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,030
Anytime you're ready, Mr. Greer.

46
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,338
Giddap! Giddap, there!

47
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,808
Giddap, there. Come on, giddap!

48
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,888
Giddap! Giddap, there!

49
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:08,274
Well, l'd say that's the way
to get a wagon out of the mud.

50
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:13,013
l'd get to water as soon as l could
and wash your animals down...

51
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,677
before that mud cakes on them.

52
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,482
l'll do that, Mr. Stride.

53
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,487
l can't thank you enough.
Can we, Annie?

54
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,359
Glad to be of help.

55
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:23,896
Good day.

56
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:28,925
Oh, Mr. Stride?

57
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,837
l don't know exactly
how to say this, but...

58
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:36,403
well, if there's another mudhole
in Arizona, we'll get stuck in it, and...

59
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,736
Well, l'd feel a whole lot better
if you'd ride along with us.

60
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:41,511
l'm headed south.

61
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,673
Well, so are we.
Looks like we got company, Annie.

62
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,728
-Mr. Stride.
-Ma'am.

63
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,340
l want you to know
how much we appreciate this...

64
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:46,240
-your riding with us.
-Glad to be of help, if l can.

65
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,835
Oh, you can!

66
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,073
That isn't the first trouble we've had.

67
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,980
We've had broken wheels,
broken spokes, broken hubs, and...

68
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:56,612
Goodness knows what would have
happened if you hadn't come along.

69
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,790
We're from the East, you know.

70
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,795
l figured you were.

71
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:13,000
l just wanted to let you know
how much we appreciate this...

72
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,567
your riding along with us.

73
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,621
Well, as l was saying...

74
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:38,254
l'll never forget the look in Annie's eyes
when l told her what l wanted to do.

75
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,389
l guess she thought l was crazy.

76
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:44,128
''You can't talk your way from
Kansas City to California,'' she said.

77
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,767
And the most outdoors l've ever seen
was our own backyard.

78
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:51,042
She didn't try to stop me. Nope.
Not Annie.

79
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:57,109
lt sure is wild country.
Well, l like wild things.

80
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,684
l guess that's why l've never been
able to settle down to one job.

81
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:03,152
lt'll be different this time, though...

82
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,654
if we ever make it.

83
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,849
l never knew any place could be so far.

84
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,224
Yeah, they say there's no end to what
a good salesman can make out there.

85
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,956
What with the shipping trade and all.

86
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,965
Did you ever hear that, Mr. Stride?

87
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,405
Yes. Yes, l have.

88
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,377
Better wash his withers down again.

89
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,107
-They go raw easy with mud on them.
-You're the boss.

90
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,449
Of course, Annie was right about
my not being able to talk my way...

91
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:36,521
across the country.

92
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,749
Our money ran dry two weeks ago.

93
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:42,217
l've had to take odd jobs
along the way to stake us.

94
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:45,422
But we'll make it.
California, that's where we're going.

95
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,092
Figure you'll get there heading south?

96
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,896
l plan to swing west
to get at Flora Vista.

97
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,870
That way l can follow
the Sonora borderline all the way in.

98
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,807
At least, that's what a fellow told me
back in Silver Springs.

99
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,512
There. That clean enough, Mr. Stride?

100
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,682
Mr. Stride, that clean enough?

101
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,856
-Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's fine.
-Good.

102
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:15,893
Come on, boy.

103
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,065
Annie. Better hurry up.
Time we were moving.

104
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,004
Come on, boy.

105
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,924
l think we can make it here.

106
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,321
They're headed for Flora Vista, all right.

107
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,112
-Got a gun, Greer?
-Yes.

108
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,220
Get it.

109
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,449
-Afternoon, gentlemen. Ma'am.
-Afternoon.

110
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:58,084
l'm Lt. Collins
of the Second Squadron of the Fifth.

111
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,748
What can we do for you, Lieutenant?

112
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,348
-That depends.
-On what?

113
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,223
We've been dispatched
from Fort Crittenden...

114
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,694
to make a wide sweep south...

115
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:08,164
in an attempt to contact any and all
Chiricahua in the area.

116
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,565
Reports indicate they may be
massing along the border.

117
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,867
Can't be more than 50 of them left
in the whole territory.

118
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,432
According to our scouts,
there's well over 100.

119
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,807
That including the squaws, Lieutenant?

120
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,406
l take it you don't think
the lndians are dangerous.

121
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,505
They're worse than that. They're hungry.

122
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,641
Nothing as deadly as
a half-starved Chiricahua.

123
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,219
Well, then, we agree.

124
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,288
Do we?

125
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,019
We're heading
for Flora Vista, Lieutenant.

126
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,184
Do you think we can make it
without running into trouble?

127
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,693
Well, that, l can't say.

128
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:39,457
However, l strongly recommend
that you swing this wagon around...

129
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,430
and head on back the way you came.

130
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,969
Unfortunately, the military has
no jurisdiction over civilians.

131
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,435
But if you have any regard
for the safety of the lady...

132
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:50,030
l'd think twice
before continuing on south.

133
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:52,935
Good day, ma'am, sir.

134
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,804
Forward, ho.

135
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,455
Seems like it gets harder and harder
to get to California.

136
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:13,792
Seems that way.

137
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,761
You're going on south,
aren't you, Mr. Stride?

138
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,135
Far as l can.

139
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,037
Well, why can't we stick together?

140
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,110
-l realize there's a risk involved, but...
-Look, Mr. Greer.

141
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,576
You can swing west here
as well as at the border.

142
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,544
A day will put you on the side
of the Gila River.

143
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,845
All you have to do then is keep it
to your right and follow it on in.

144
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:36,045
Shouldn't ought to take you more than
four days out of your way.

145
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,689
l've been obliged to know you.

146
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:40,625
Stride...

147
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,563
l'm not going to head west
and l'm not turning back.

148
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,031
lt's your wagon.

149
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,076
Come on, boy. Can't let them go alone.

150
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:09,854
Let's go.

151
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,250
Kind of a lonesome spot for a ranch,
isn't it, Mr. Stride?

152
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,557
lt's a relay station for the Overland Line.

153
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,632
-No use sitting here, let's get...
-Hold it!

154
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:30,293
Let the team stand. l'll go have a look.

155
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,028
Old-timer?

156
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,344
Me?

157
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,713
Guess it's gotta be, don't it.
Nobody else here.

158
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,447
-Where are they?
-lt's hard to say.

159
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,222
Headed up towards the north, maybe.

160
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,018
Then again,
they might even have turned west.

161
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,691
But, like l say...

162
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,426
it's hard to say.

163
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,423
-What run them off?
-Chiricahua.

164
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,231
Soldier boys come riding through
three days ago.

165
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,929
Claimed the lnjuns was fixin'
to kick up their heels.

166
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,201
Then we seen war fire
in them hills to the south.

167
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:20,200
So they all just up and took off
like a scalded dog.

168
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,712
Guess they figured jobs
is easier to come by than hair.

169
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,078
l'm the only one stayed behind.

170
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,051
lnjuns don't bother with me.

171
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,652
l ain't worth too awful much.

172
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,455
You say they pulled out
about three days ago?

173
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:40,258
Yeah. Bartender, he left, too.

174
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,993
Well, l'll be seeing you.
We gotta be moving.

175
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,265
You ought to do the same, mister.

176
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,498
Unless you hanker for a haircut
from a Chiricahua barber.

177
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,105
Come on, Claire.

178
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:53,144
Well, adiós.

179
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,311
That's Spanish.

180
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,489
Hello, Stride.

181
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,726
l've been looking to find you, Masters.

182
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,025
l figured you would be.

183
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,999
Soon as l heard what happened
in Silver, l figured you would.

184
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,694
-Ain't that right, Clete?
-Yep.

185
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,396
l half thought
you might know something...

186
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,496
about what happened in Silver.

187
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,175
Maybe.

188
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,004
lf you're thinking l roll with them gents,
you dead wrong.

189
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:31,014
l helped bury a few men in my time
but l ain't never sunk that low.

190
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,674
l hope not, Masters.

191
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,946
-l'd hate to have to kill you.
-l'd hate to have you try.

192
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,592
-Everything all right, Mr. Stride?
-We'll be staying here for the night.

193
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,297
l'll see to watering the stock
and bedding them down.

194
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:57,273
Get your possibles and move inside.
A hot meal will do us all good.

195
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,539
-Can l give you a hand?
-Just do like l tell you.

196
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,092
l wonder what's the matter with him.

197
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,758
Sheriff's got things on his mind.

198
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,632
-Ain't that right, Clete?
-Yep.

199
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:27,872
Ma'am.

200
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:44,756
Sheriff.

201
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,808
l'll tell you, this has got to be cooking.

202
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:08,369
Real cooking.

203
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,877
Ain't that right, Clete?

204
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,184
l said, ''Ain't that right?''

205
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:20,184
Yeah, sure. That's right.

206
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:23,453
Have to excuse Clete, here, ma'am.
He's kind of short on manners.

207
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,525
-More coffee?
-Well, yes, ma'am.

208
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,624
Don't mind if l do. Don't mind at all.

209
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,537
More coffee, John?

210
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:37,542
John?

211
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,135
More coffee?

212
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,009
No, thanks, Annie.

213
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,711
You say you're from Silver Springs,
Mr. Masters.

214
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,919
-Mostly.
-He was born there.

215
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,418
-Who said?
-You said!

216
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:56,717
l was young when l come there, Clete,
but l wasn't born there.

217
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,667
My folks had me in a shack up
in Lerno, ma'am.

218
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:06,731
They moved to Silver
the summer l was first able to walk.

219
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:10,296
And Mr. Stride, is he from Silver, too?

220
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:11,841
The sheriff, ma'am?

221
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,906
Yes, ma'am.
He was the law there for 12 years.

222
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,574
Was?

223
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:20,273
Yeah, they held an election
back last fall. Sheriff, he run...

224
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,547
but he wasn't much at kissing babies.

225
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,554
When they come to counting up...

226
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:28,388
he didn't have nothing but a spot on
his shirt where the badge used to hang.

227
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,184
Of course,
that won't make no never mind...

228
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,626
when he catches up
to them that done it.

229
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,661
The killing back in Silver.

230
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,736
-Didn't he tell you?
-No.

231
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:41,405
l reckon he wouldn't, at that.

232
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,307
You say there was a killing,
Mr. Masters?

233
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,338
Silver express office was held up.

234
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,771
Fargo box was stole. Lot of shooting.

235
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,111
Somebody was bound to get hurt.

236
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,985
Just too bad it had to be her.

237
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,055
Her?

238
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,959
Yeah, they killed her. The Sheriff's wife.

239
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,575
-Coffee?
-Thank you.

240
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,450
ls that a coyote?

241
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:30,886
l hope so.

242
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:34,652
Mr. Masters told us about...

243
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,327
Well, he told us about your wife.

244
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:42,426
Would you like to talk about her?

245
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,593
l know it's none of my business...

246
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,466
but it might make it easier.

247
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:50,741
You're right, Mrs. Greer.
lt's none of your business...

248
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,605
and it won't make it any easier.

249
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:56,407
Good night.

250
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,381
Mrs. Greer?

251
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:04,249
There's one thing Masters in there
didn't tell you.

252
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,861
The reason my wife is dead.

253
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,426
Six months ago...

254
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:17,658
l lost my job
as the Sheriff of Silver Springs.

255
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,471
Three of those months,
l tried to get work.

256
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:24,338
Work that was fitting an ex-sheriff,
but l didn't find any.

257
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:27,872
The town allowed as
l could be the Deputy...

258
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:32,410
but my pride wouldn't let me,
so my wife had to take a job.

259
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:36,218
A clerk, checking freight for Fargo.

260
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:41,356
She was working at that job
the night she was killed.

261
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:47,592
Good night, Mrs. Greer.

262
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,181
Mighty fancy lady, that Mrs. Greer.

263
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,647
Think they'd get tired of crawling
around out there playing coyote.

264
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:18,422
Sheriff...

265
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:22,423
folks back in Silver said
you high-ended it out of town...

266
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,230
without knowing how much
them gents rode off with.

267
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,696
$20,000 in gold.

268
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,035
Fargo box near full of the stuff.

269
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:37,079
Of course, l know that ain't the reason
you're riding them down, but...

270
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:41,308
Well, that's sort of
why l'm gonna tag along with you.

271
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:48,189
You see, me and Clete figure that
when they left Silver they scattered.

272
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,453
Seven of them.

273
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:53,363
Two fresh-dug holes
where your tracks begin.

274
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:56,858
That leaves five still alive.

275
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:00,904
And one of them's got that strongbox.

276
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:02,573
So?

277
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,375
So.

278
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,503
lf they're headed for Flora Vista...

279
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:09,875
That means they're fixing
to trade the gold across the border...

280
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:11,141
and ride away rich.

281
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:12,744
That is...

282
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,978
unless, of course, you catch up to them.

283
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,348
And if l do?

284
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:20,748
Then, all that stands
between me and $20,000...

285
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:23,020
is you.

286
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,390
Good night, Sheriff.

287
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:25,656
Masters.

288
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:26,964
Yeah?

289
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,129
You know who they are, don't you?

290
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,861
Maybe.

291
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,504
One thing for sure, though.

292
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,937
They know you.

293
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,932
You see, that's the trouble
with being a sheriff.

294
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:41,841
The only time you get to know a man
by his face...

295
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,914
is when you shut a cell door on it...

296
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,110
like you did mine.

297
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,732
-More coffee?
-No, thanks, Mrs. Greer.

298
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,475
-More coffee, John?
-No, thanks, Annie.

299
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:33,189
Hold it!

300
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,296
That was using your head, Stride.

301
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:46,628
l think we could have
handled them, though.

302
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,571
l was just going for my rifle.
l was scared.

303
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,868
We all were scared.

304
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:56,312
We better get moving. That horse
isn't going to hold them off long.

305
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:04,980
-lt just don't seem right to me.
-What don't?

306
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:08,449
Why a full woman like that
would settle for half a man.

307
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:10,384
Why don't you ask her why?

308
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,048
Maybe l will, Clete. Maybe l will.

309
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,153
You stay with the wagon, Clete.

310
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,582
l'll get your horse.

311
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,648
He was fixing to cut you down.

312
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:49,884
You know him?

313
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,819
-No.
-He sure knew you...

314
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,020
Sheriff.

315
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:11,533
Mrs. Greer...

316
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:13,701
l suppose she want to read
over this gent.

317
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:16,712
All she said was to see
he's covered in a proper grave.

318
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:18,338
lt's a waste of time, anyhow.

319
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,314
lf a man ain't ready
when he gets this far...

320
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:23,546
a couple of holies said over his grave
ain't gonna help him none.

321
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,781
Anyhow, he ain't dug too deep.

322
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,581
-Clete.
-Yep?

323
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,660
-How old do you figure she is?
-Who?

324
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,160
Annie Greer.

325
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,562
Now, how would l know?

326
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,496
Twenty-five, twenty-six, would you say?

327
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,899
Want me to bury your boots, too?

328
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,939
She's a real looker, ain't she?

329
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,564
She ain't ugly.

330
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:47,701
A man could grow mighty fond
of a woman like that.

331
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,147
Looks like one already has.

332
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:53,684
Now, what would ever make you say
a thing like that, Clete?

333
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:49,668
That should be enough.

334
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,506
-Here, let me do this.
-Thank you.

335
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,201
Most men object
to doing a woman's work.

336
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:56,871
l hardly blame them, though.

337
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,779
They're right about our work
never being done.

338
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:06,014
Sure don't look like a man
with killing on his mind.

339
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,492
Say, you're quite a hand at this.

340
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:11,426
A woman would be fortunate
to have you around.

341
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,988
Would she, ma'am?

342
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,966
You shouldn't blame yourself
for what happened.

343
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:27,467
A man ought to be able
to take care of his woman.

344
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,068
Like my man?

345
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,739
Do you think l love him any less
because of the way he is?

346
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:34,782
Yes, ma'am.

347
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,554
You're making a big mistake,
Mrs. Greer.

348
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,318
Them clothes of yours.
They'll never dry.

349
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,892
Storm's coming.

350
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:32,300
Hey, wake up.

351
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:35,504
Come on, take over.
l'm gonna go get me a cup of coffee.

352
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,122
Well, right cozy in here, ain't it?

353
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:49,021
-Come on in.
-Thanks.

354
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:50,354
Coffee?

355
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,018
Don't mind if l do.

356
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:54,063
l'm afraid it's not as hot as it could be.

357
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,860
Just so as it's black.

358
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,895
-Storm seems to be letting up some.
-Yes, ma'am.

359
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:05,100
Stars'll be showing,
time it's your turn to take the guard.

360
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:08,203
Mr. Masters,
you know this part of the country.

361
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:09,574
Every rock.

362
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,205
Well, how far would you say we are
from Flora Vista?

363
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:13,840
With an early start come morning...

364
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:16,317
you should be able to noon there
with near no trouble at all.

365
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,450
Thank you.

366
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,819
Sure is good coffee, ma'am.

367
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,097
Mr. Greer...

368
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,430
how come you ever to
marry such a handsome woman?

369
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,432
Well, l...

370
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,733
We fell in love, Mr. Masters.

371
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:37,933
Love?

372
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:41,035
That's a mighty fancy word.

373
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:46,174
That's the trouble with the likes
of you and me, Sheriff.

374
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:49,810
We never take time out
for the fancy things in life.

375
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:55,258
We leave that to the fellows
that run sort of gentle, soft.

376
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,498
More coffee?

377
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:10,435
Been that way ever since ever, l guess.

378
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:15,209
Of course, that ain't saying that women
don't warm up to the likes of us.

379
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:16,711
Why, no, sir.

380
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:21,516
Why, l knew me a little old gal one time,
looked a whole lot like you, Mrs. Greer.

381
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,353
She'd been married
maybe five, six years.

382
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,920
Husband, he kind of short on spine.

383
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:30,292
And one day, along come this big,
good-looking gent...

384
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:32,487
started warming up to her.

385
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:36,128
First thing you know, why,
this little old gal, she just up and...

386
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:38,292
Drink your coffee, Masters.

387
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:48,003
Ain't you interested
in what she up and did, Sheriff?

388
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,576
You...

389
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:56,345
you say she looked like me?

390
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:59,379
Not near as pretty, ma'am.

391
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:03,319
Her eyes, they didn't show
a deep blue like yours.

392
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:07,387
Can't recollect her hair too well...

393
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:11,059
but couldn't have been near as soft
or as black as yours.

394
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:13,299
And the way she walked...

395
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:15,796
nothing like you.

396
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,469
You move like you're all over alive.

397
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,909
And you say words quiet, soft.

398
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:31,014
Kind of making a man wish that
you was talking to him and nobody else.

399
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:40,761
Yeah, she looked a lot like you, ma'am.
But not near as pretty.

400
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,901
Well, l guess it's about time
we were turning in.

401
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,703
Well, don't you want to hear
the rest of the story, Mr. Greer?

402
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,472
You might could
learn something from it.

403
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,775
l don't understand.

404
00:41:58,115 --> 00:41:59,446
Don't you?

405
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:02,910
He said he didn't.

406
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:08,087
You know what, Sheriff?
l just happened to think of something.

407
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,625
Danged if you don't remind me...

408
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,786
of that big, good-looking gent
l was talking about.

409
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,623
You know, the one that run off
with the other fellow's woman?

410
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:21,401
Seems that ain't nobody don't remind
you of somebody tonight, Masters.

411
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,542
Seems that way, don't it?

412
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:35,317
Sure you don't wanna hear
the rest of the story?

413
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,195
Suit yourself.

414
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,895
Much obliged for the coffee, ma'am.
Good night.

415
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:52,563
Good night, Sheriff.

416
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,111
Masters.

417
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,351
-Yeah?
-Leave him alone.

418
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:17,256
-l don't know what you're talking about.
-Just do as l tell you.

419
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:19,329
Maybe you better
mind your own business.

420
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,763
Unless, of course,
Mrs. Greer in there is your business.

421
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:24,561
Good night, Sheriff.

422
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:27,497
l said, good night.

423
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:55,624
Get up.

424
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:04,033
lt might be better all around
if you'd move along, Masters.

425
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:07,700
Maybe you're right.

426
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,044
Let's saddle up, Clete.

427
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,276
Here...

428
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:16,749
you'll be needing that.

429
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:26,790
Come on down.
l'll relieve you at midnight.

430
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:20,915
Mr. Stride?

431
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:33,828
Yes, ma'am?

432
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:37,730
Those...

433
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:40,327
Those men you're after...

434
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:43,565
they'll be waiting for you
in Flora Vista, won't they?

435
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:46,865
That depends.

436
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:50,806
Please, be careful.

437
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:54,116
Yes, ma'am. l plan to.

438
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:10,459
Good night.

439
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:13,463
Good night, Mrs. Greer.

440
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:22,401
Pour us a drink, Clete.

441
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:04,374
Where is everybody?

442
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:09,284
Hello, Masters.

443
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:11,750
Why, hello, Bodeen.

444
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:15,319
l kind of figured l'd find you around here.

445
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:18,326
Clete, this is Payte Bodeen
from Silver Springs.

446
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:20,188
Clete.

447
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,836
You're kind of a long way from home,
ain't you?

448
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:30,463
No more than you.

449
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:34,744
l can go back.

450
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:43,114
Ladies.

451
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,882
This here is going to be
a private conversation, Nelly.

452
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:47,616
Well, sure, Payte. Sure.

453
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:50,585
You boys join me in a drink?

454
00:48:50,794 --> 00:48:52,853
That's what we've come for.

455
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:00,396
Cheers.

456
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:07,567
Strange, ain't it?

457
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,578
Running onto each other like this.

458
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,375
-ls it?
-Yeah.

459
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:16,517
Man don't ride south in this country
unless he got a reason.

460
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:26,553
-You got a reason, Masters?
-What do you think?

461
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:35,561
l hear they had themselves a holdup
back in Silver.

462
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:37,635
Yeah, we heard that.

463
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:44,809
lt'll go hard with them that done it,
if they catch up to them.

464
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:48,174
Yeah, it sure will.

465
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:49,252
Payte!

466
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:54,253
Howdy, Payte.

467
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:56,483
Everything all right?

468
00:49:56,593 --> 00:49:58,527
Everything's just fine.

469
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:01,222
-Have a drink.
-Can use it.

470
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,731
Been running from Chiricahua
for two days.

471
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,699
Lucky to be here at all.

472
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:22,043
You boys waiting for somebody?

473
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,676
They ain't coming.

474
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:29,717
Ground's gonna be full of men,
time Stride gets through.

475
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:31,421
Stride?

476
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,557
Since when's he toting a badge again?

477
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:37,758
He ain't. Oh, didn't you know?
lt was his wife they killed...

478
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,302
in that express office back in Silver.

479
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:45,399
Much obliged for the drink.
Come on, Clete.

480
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:50,003
-Masters.
-Yeah?

481
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:54,678
Stride turned a key on you once,
didn't he?

482
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,310
Twice.

483
00:50:57,754 --> 00:50:59,585
Man put me in jail...

484
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:05,025
l'd get even with him, if l could.

485
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:06,923
l don't follow you.

486
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:12,790
Them holdup fellows.
They got off with $20,000 in gold.

487
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:15,331
l heard.

488
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,138
So, it figures...

489
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:21,776
if they knew where to find the gent that
was after them, before he found them...

490
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:25,246
they'd stand a whole lot better chance
of getting to spend it.

491
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:27,583
lf l was them...

492
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:31,650
l'd be willing to offer a fair amount
for information like that.

493
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:36,222
When would a man get
this fair amount...

494
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:39,123
supposing of course,
that you were them?

495
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:47,432
When the wagon gets here
with the gold.

496
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:48,663
Wagon?

497
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:52,570
Fellow's bringing it in from Silver for us.

498
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:54,143
Name's Greer.

499
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:58,175
John Greer.

500
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:15,155
-Well, Mr. Stride, good luck.
-Same to you.

501
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:17,733
And, thanks. Thanks a lot.

502
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:28,538
Mr. Stride?

503
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:36,117
l didn't want you to leave
without your clean shirt.

504
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:44,117
-l washed it for you.
-Thank you.

505
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:49,429
-Will we be seeing you in Flora Vista?
-l'll be there.

506
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:53,565
-l wish you'd let us go in with you.
-You know l can't do that.

507
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:00,666
-They'll kill you, won't they?
-They'll try.

508
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:03,177
-Then why-
-Look, Mrs. Greer...

509
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:07,342
l'm obliged for your concern.

510
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:15,087
You must have loved her very much.

511
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:20,222
-She was a good woman.
-Yes, she'd have to be.

512
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,739
Look.

513
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:06,241
lt's Stride's horse.

514
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:37,931
Annie!

515
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,158
How is he?

516
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,994
l don't know how he is.
He is still unconscious.

517
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,464
-Anything l can do?
-No.

518
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:08,296
Annie...

519
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:10,065
we ought to
take him on into Flora Vista.

520
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:12,539
-There's bound to be a doctor there-
-We can't do that, John.

521
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:15,440
-But he's liable to die.
-Well, don't you think l know that?

522
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:18,139
Annie, we're taking him on in.

523
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:21,313
You listen to me, John Greer.

524
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:23,908
lf it wasn't for Stride,
we'd still be hub-high in mud...

525
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,681
twenty miles out of Silver.

526
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,221
He had reason to leave us,
good reason...

527
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:28,915
but he didn't,
because he knew we needed him.

528
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:31,050
-But, Annie, you've got to...
-Those men in Flora Vista...

529
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,219
are waiting for him.
Waiting to shoot him down.

530
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:36,430
You take Stride's horse in
and bring a doctor back.

531
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:39,199
Annie.

532
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:42,268
Annie, l can't do that.

533
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:45,640
l've got to take the wagon in when l go.
lt's something l have to do.

534
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:47,300
l just have to.

535
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:51,175
When we came through Silver,
remember l told you l got a job?

536
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,804
Well, l did, only...

537
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:54,746
Well, it wasn't a real job.

538
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:57,809
l guess l knew it was wrong
all along, but...

539
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,013
Well, you know we needed the money.

540
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:03,486
They said l was to ask no questions,
just do as they told me.

541
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:06,460
l swear, l didn't know
it was going to turn out like this.

542
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:08,621
John, what are you trying to say?

543
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,767
Annie, come here.

544
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:36,553
This is what l'm trying to say.

545
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:39,423
$500 they said they'd give me.
All l had to do was haul it.

546
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:42,726
l picked it up in the tool shed
behind the express office.

547
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,355
-No...
-They're waiting for me now...

548
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:46,958
in the saloon in Flora Vista.
l'm due there today.

549
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,799
That's why l couldn't turn back.

550
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:52,341
-And l can't take Stride's horse in.
-Throw it down, Mr. Greer.

551
01:01:57,914 --> 01:02:00,348
lf l go in without this, they'll kill me.

552
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:02,245
Throw it down.

553
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,793
Mrs. Greer, get up in the seat.

554
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:22,737
Just south of that canyon wall...

555
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:26,104
the trail swings west.
Stay on it, you'll get to California.

556
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,707
What about you?

557
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,710
lt's the gold they're after.
lf you don't show up...

558
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:33,577
they'll be along to get me.

559
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:36,048
But you can't do this.

560
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:37,676
Only thing l can do.

561
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:40,278
l've thought about it,
it's the only chance l've got...

562
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:42,220
them coming to me.

563
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:44,786
Those men, Stride...

564
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:47,789
l didn't know what they'd done.

565
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:49,626
You have to believe that.

566
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:52,699
lf l thought it any different,
l'd have killed you.

567
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,265
Now, get her out of here.

568
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:06,509
Stride.

569
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:01,765
Annie, there's bound to be
a sheriff in Flora Vista.

570
01:04:02,104 --> 01:04:04,004
We can't leave him back there.

571
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,684
They should've been back by now,
Payte.

572
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:27,626
-Maybe we'd better...
-Shut up.

573
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:30,296
Been me,
l'd never send just two men out.

574
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,566
Man like Stride's awful tough to kill.

575
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,195
You talk a lot, Masters.

576
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,636
Couldn't be l touched you
where it hurt, could it, Payte?

577
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:43,211
Sometimes he gets awful touchy.

578
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:46,338
Say out in words
what you're thinking, Masters.

579
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:48,911
Payte?

580
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:52,845
You wanna know what l'm thinking?

581
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:01,761
l think you sent them boys
out on purpose not to come back.

582
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:04,458
You think l'd do a thing like that?

583
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:07,200
l know you would.

584
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:15,400
Then it figures l'd do the same to you...

585
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:18,142
if l get the chance.

586
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:27,649
You got it.

587
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,030
Wagon's coming!

588
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:15,165
Hello, Greer!

589
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:22,069
We were beginning to think
you weren't coming.

590
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:30,209
Why don't you pull around back here?
We'll help you unload.

591
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:32,648
There's nothing to unload.

592
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:39,689
-Where is it?
-Stride's got it.

593
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:47,393
He says if you want it,
you'll have to come and get it.

594
01:06:47,636 --> 01:06:48,864
You know where he is?

595
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:51,337
About a half-hour north
in a deep canyon.

596
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:54,340
He's sitting there, waiting.

597
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:57,503
l know the place, Payte.

598
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:12,588
-You wait here, Annie.
-John.

599
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:43,491
l suppose you'll figure as
l owe you something, Greer.

600
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:46,561
No. But there's something l owe Stride.

601
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,268
Get out of my way, Bodeen.

602
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:57,431
Go around.

603
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:35,573
l was wrong, Clete.
He wasn't half a man.

604
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,145
Come on.

605
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,366
There it is.

606
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:17,051
Stride!

607
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:23,286
This here is Payte Bodeen!

608
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:30,490
We come to get the box!

609
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:35,936
-Well, let's go get...
-Hold it.

610
01:09:36,705 --> 01:09:39,538
-Think you can get a rope over it?
-You know l can.

611
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:43,474
l'll circle around.
We'll come at it from both sides.

612
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:31,397
Hold it!

613
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:55,861
-What happened up there?
-Payte Bodeen...

614
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,990
l killed him.

615
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,933
-Why?
-Why not?

616
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:06,474
-Clete?
-Dead.

617
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:11,441
Sure is a shame, me and you
having to face it out this way.

618
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:15,350
You could have stayed behind a rock.

619
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:18,877
l never could enjoy
spending this $20,000...

620
01:14:18,987 --> 01:14:21,080
l'd done you that way, Sheriff.

621
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:28,059
l don't suppose
there's any way of getting at this box...

622
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:29,858
aside from going over you.

623
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:36,798
l didn't figure there was.

624
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:41,073
l sure would hate to have to do this...

625
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:43,007
what with Annie Greer
being how she is.

626
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:45,871
How is she?

627
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:48,872
A widow.

628
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:54,155
Her husband,
he talked himself to death...

629
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:56,816
in front of the Sheriff's office
