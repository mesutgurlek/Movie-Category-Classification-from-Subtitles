'This picture is based on
a little-known episode in American history.

00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,514
'After Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo,

3
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,229
'his officers and their families
were exiled from France

4
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,074
'as punishment for devotedly following
an adored leader.

5
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,913
'Bewildered, they turned to the one country

6
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,276
'they thought
would sympathize with their plight.

7
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,749
'And the United States welcomed them.

8
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,152
'By Act of Congress, they were granted
four townships in the territory of Alabama,

out of the American wilderness,

11

14
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,669
- Colonel Geraud.
- Mademoiselle?

15
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,594
You could dismount and walk with me
to see what's in the shops.

16
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,719
The shops, mademoiselle,
as you call them, are mostly taverns.

17
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,030
Besides, Blake will be out any moment now.

18
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,590
Oh, but just sitting here. And the sun...

19
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,558
Perhaps an ice or maybe a cool drink.

20
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,632
- Do you think we could find one?
- I'm sure I could find one.

21
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,473
But please do not leave the carriage.

22
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,348
- There's a militia regiment in town...
- All right, Colonel Geraud.

23
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,113
I promise I shall not leave the carriage.

24
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,156
- Promise?
- Mm-hm.

25
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,432
Only 800 miles more to go

26
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,479
Only 800 miles more to go
More to go

27
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,437
And if we can just get lucky

28
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,476
We will wind up in Kentucky...

29
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,758
- All right, Kentucky. Here we go.
- 800 miles more to go

30
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,515
Oh, we fought with the 7th over creeks

31
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,875
And we ain't had a bridge...

32
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,272
2nd Kentucky, outside. On the double.

33
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,476
We will make it to Kentucky

34
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,711
- Only 800 miles more to go...
- Goodbye, honey.

35
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,756
You didn't kiss me!

36
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,590
Lady, he's busy.

37
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,709
2nd Kentucky, outside.

38
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,428
- Is that you, Colonel Geraud?
- No.

39
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,195
If you'll just let on like we're old friends.

40
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,508
- 2nd Kentucky?
- Yes, ma'am.

41
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,830
Breen's the name. John Breen.

42
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,832
- Deserting?
- No, ma'am.

43
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,229
They're leaving. I'm staying.

44
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,393
Only 800 miles more to go
More to go

45
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,471
And if we can just get lucky

46
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,596
We will wind up in Kentucky

47
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,593
Only 800 miles more to go

48
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,238
Thank you, ma'am.

49
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,153
Uh-oh. It's Willie Paine.

50
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,952
Come on!

51
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,391
He's sure to recognize me.

52
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,630
Mind if we drive around the square?

53
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,954
Buck, take charge of these mules.

54
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,270
Hank, you and Beau's coming with me.

55
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,992
This has been
right neighborly of you, ma'am.

56
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,789
Sorry I can't wait to pay my respects
to your menfolk’s.

57
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,832
Uh-oh.

58
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,918
Sorry.

59
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,835
You fellas better catch the regiment.
This may go on all day.

60
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,995
Ma'am, this is
downright inconvenient for you.

61
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,232
Uh-oh.

62
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,038
Willie again.

63
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,758
Hyah!

64
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,832
Thank you, ma'am.

65
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,433
You've been mighty patient.

66
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,637
I sure appreciate your kindness
to a total stranger.

67
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,438
Uh-oh.

68
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,799
- I was afraid he wouldn't make it.
- Huh?

69
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,871
I said I was afraid he wouldn't make it.

70
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,112
Now, if we were to head that way,
at a nice spanking trot,

71
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,031
I'm sure Willie couldn't keep up.

72
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,111
Yes, ma'am.

73
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,509
Hyah!

74
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,355
Rest the team before we turn back.

75
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,557
Ma'am, you're uncommon gracious.
I'd sure admire to meet you properly.

76
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,471
May I come a-calling?

77
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,109
- I'm leaving Mobile tomorrow.
- Oh. That's bad.

78
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,872
Well, there's tonight.

79
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,428
I shall be busy getting ready for tomorrow.

80
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,875
That narrows it down to this afternoon.

81
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,149
- Short time to make a lasting impression.
- You will try though, won't you?

82
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,274
- What's that, ma'am?
- I say you will try, won't you?

83
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,592
After all the trouble you and your friend
Willie took to get me out here,

84
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,319
surely you'll compliment me with an effort?

85
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,437
You're downright discouraging
to romance, ma'am.

86
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,036
Couldn't you act just a little frightened
to sort of save my pride?

87
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,315
Now, would you and your pride
please take me back to Mobile?

88
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,518
- You look beautiful with your eyes shining.
- Monsieur John Breen, please...

89
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,875
You're also inclined to talk too much.

90
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,869
- What is it?
- Somebody in a hurry.

91
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,839
- Do you know 'em?
- The man in the lead is Blake Randolph.

92
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,230
The one in uniform
is Colonel Georges Geraud.

93
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,550
One of the others is Mr. George Hayden.

94
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,792
- But the fourth I don't recognize.
- I do. It's the sheriff.

95
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,355
Are the rest of 'em friends of yours?

96
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,955
Yes. This is Mr. Randolph's carriage.
You see, I...

97
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,390
- You're not Mrs. Randolph?
- No, no...

98
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,074
Don't bother. Nothing else matters.

99
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,708
There he is, Sheriff. You take my horse,
I'll go back in the carriage.

100
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,270
- Step down, please.
- You're under arrest, soldier.

101
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,112
I thought he was sheriff.

102
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,909
- Blake, it's all my fault.
- Don't trouble yourself, mademoiselle.

103
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,357
Your concern is needless. The charge
has nothing to do with the carriage.

104
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,159
- Then what am I being arrested for?
- Assault.

105
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,472
- Who did I assault?
- Did you hit a man at the tavern bar?

106
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,154
- Oh, that.
- Yep, that.

107
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,870
It was a political argument. A fellow said
Henry Clay was a scoundrel, so I hit him.

108
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,916
We had a drink afterwards.

109
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,309
You're wasting your time, Sheriff.
Take him away.

110
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,073
Wait a minute, you fellas can't be serious.

111
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,879
Things like that happen every day
in Kentucky.

112
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,794
I don't doubt it.
Now, if you'll be good enough to step down.

113
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,715
Did my opponent sign a complaint?

114
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,597
- Well, no.
- But he will.

115
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,272
Oh.

116
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,514
Mr. Randolph, I'm prepared to apologize
for taking your carriage.

117
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,398
I heard yesterday that you control the river.

118
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,677
Now I learn that you control
most everything else hereabouts.

119
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,513
We'll discuss that later.
Now, if you wouldn't mind...

120
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,149
Oh, we've marched
and skedaddled back and forth

121
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,199
And we've been everywhere in the north

122
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,512
So we thought we'd quit a-roving
and we started home-sweet-homing

123
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,798
Oh, there's 800 miles more to go

124
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,395
Only 800 miles more to go
More to go

125
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,032
Only 800 miles more to go
More to go

126
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,031
And if we can just get lucky

127
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,350
We will wind up in Kentucky

128
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,194
Only 800 miles more to go

129
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,430
Kentucky...

130
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,113
Halt!

131
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,509
Breen! We've been looking for you.

132
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,236
- Trouble?
- No, sir.

133
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,869
This lady and these gentlemen
brought me to wait for you.

134
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,474
- May I present Captain Carroll?
- Ma'am.

135
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,120
- Colonel Geraud, Captain Carroll.
- Colonel.

136
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,668
- This is the sheriff of Mobile.
- Sheriff.

137
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,672
And this is Mr., uh... Hayden, isn't it?

138
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,796
And this, sir, is Mr. Randolph.

139
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,755
- Mr. Blake Randolph?
- Yes, sir.

140
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,752
- Who wouldn't let us use the riverboat?
- Yes, sir.

141
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,798
Mm-hm. I see.

142
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,318
Well, fall in when you're finished.

143
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,876
Mademoiselle, forgive me.

144
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,269
Colonel Geraud, my respects, sir.

145
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,918
Sheriff, sorry.

146
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,354
And you, sir, if you ever get up
Kentucky way, drop in and see us.

147
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,117
Forward, hey!

148
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,710
Oh, we thought we were gonna go by boat

149
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,433
And we went to Mobile to have a talk

150
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,559
But the man that owns the water
said he thought we hadn't oughta

151
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,916
So it looks like a long, long walk

152
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,071
Only 800 miles more to go
More to go

153
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,789
Only 800 miles more to go
More to go...

154
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,273
Monsieur Blake,
that Breen business was actually my fault.

155
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,194
- You mean you knew him?
- As one soldier to another.

156
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,956
Colonel Geraud is very gallant
in trying to relieve me of embarrassment.

157
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,431
The truth is I was bored
and acted very foolishly.

158
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,954
- Forgive me.
- Perhaps the fault is mine.

159
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,556
I shouldn't have kept you waiting for so long.
Let's forget that it happened.

160
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,994
Howdy, everybody.

161
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,833
Glad to see you back home, Miss Fleurette.

162
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,789
Folks, General De Marchand has asked me
to take charge of this soirée.

163
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,233
That's French.

164
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,675
And it being a special occasion,

165
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,912
announcing the coming wedding
of Miss Fleurette and Mr. Blake Randolph,

166
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,515
ain't nobody barred
from having a good time.

167
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,991
That includes you and the river men,
Carter Ward.

168
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,868
I don't know any better way to get started
than with a little singing.

169
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,192
Oh, this war is mighty hard on feet

170
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,158
And we sure never get enough to eat

171
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,472
And a belly full of colic
doesn't help a man to frolic

172
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,155
When there's 600 miles more to go...

173
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,356
Soldiers coming!

174
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,192
Round up the strays!

175
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,113
Only 600 miles more to go...

176
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,191
Oh, excuse me, Mama.

177
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,032
And if we can just get lucky

178
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,031
We will wind up in Kentucky

179
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,237
Only 600 miles more to go

180
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,676
Only 600 miles more to go
More to go

181
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,028
Only 600 miles more to go
More to go

182
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,634
And if we could just get lucky

183
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,551
We will wind up in Kentucky

184
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,758
Only 600 miles more to go...

185
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,229
Column ranks...

186
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,878
ho!

187
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,956
Kentucky... halt!

188
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,873
Forward right... turn!

189
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,916
Kentucky...

190
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,354
halt!

191
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,715
Shoulder... arms!

192
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,318
At ease!

193
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,072
Phew.

194
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,711
Sorry to interrupt you
this way, gentlemen, but...

195
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,598
Mr. Randolph, isn't it?

196
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,353
John Breen is a friend of yours.

197
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,714
Howdy, Mr. Randolph.

198
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,989
May I present Captain Carroll
and John Breen, sir?

199
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,389
Gentlemen, your host - Paul De Marchand,

200
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,040
general of a division
of the armies of France,

201
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,236
lately commanding the Emperor's Guard.

202
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,312
- Emperor Napoleon, sir?
- Yes, Captain.

203
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,595
Kentucky, hut!

204
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,636
Present arms!

205
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,512
Order... arms!

206
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,957
Thank you, Captain, and welcome.

207
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,918
- The bar is right over there.
- Dismissed!

208
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,196
Thank you, sir.

209
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,710
Here's something for your throat.

210
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,756
Well, thanks, Willie.

211
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,636
- Ahh.
- Mmm, that's right soothing.

212
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,711
Yeah, considering
how far we've marched.

213
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,156
But for downright drinking,
we've got something in Kentucky...

214
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,956
Here.

215
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,838
Take care of Betsy-Anne for me, will you?

216
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,151
Miss De Marchand?

217
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,471
Why, of course! Monsieur Breen.

218
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,991
I should have recognized the song.

219
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,719
Yes, ma'am. That's why I was singing.

220
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,756
Hello, you.

221
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,357
Hello, John Breen.

222
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,798
Oh, Mama, may I present
John Breen of Kentucky?

223
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,872
- How do you do, monsieur?
- Charmed, ma'am.

224
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,350
Meet another Kentuckian - Captain Carroll.

225
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,908
- Captain, Madame De Marchand.
- My pleasure, ma'am.

226
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,798
Are you two gentlemen
old friends of my daughter?

227
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,518
Well, not exactly.

228
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,750
- We met in Mobile.
- 10 days ago.

229
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,671
You both know
Monsieur Randolph?

230
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,113
Yes, ma'am.

231
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,589
Seems like the wrestling's
been decided in a hurry.

232
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,433
There being no other contestants,

233
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,592
this gallon of rum is awarded to Jacques.

234
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,716
Hold it right there, mister.

235
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,075
Did you say "gallon of rum"?

236
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,836
Yes. The first prize for the wrestling
is a gallon of Jamaica rum,

237
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,832
donated by Mr. Blake Randolph.

238
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,234
What do we have to do to win it?

239
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,032
Just throw Jacques.

240
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,194
If one of you gentlemen
would like to try it, just step this way.

241
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,350
Let's get in on this.

242
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,158
Oh, they're just horse playing, General.

243
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,916
All right, ladies, here come
the broken heads.

244
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,593
- Captain Carroll? Captain Carroll?!
- Yes, sir.

245
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,750
- Your men.
- Yes, sir!

246
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,155
Kentucky, come on, break it up!

247
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,031
Have you any idea who you were hitting?!

248
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,552
Stop them, John Breen, please.
They'll spoil everything.

249
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,437
Oh, it's nothing but a little...

250
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,196
Excuse me, ma'am.

251
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,556
Willie! Willie!

252
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,352
Blow!

253
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,193
- No, the bugle. Blow!

254
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,793
Come on, Kentucky!

255
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,948
- What in the world was that?
- Mess call.

256
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,951
- What?
- Mess call.

257
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,395
Mess call?! Mess call!

258
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,116
Kentucky, get in line!

259
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,116
Let me down, oh, hangman

260
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,113
Please let me down a while

261
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,876
I think I see my lover comin'

262
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,919
Ridin' many a mile

263
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,915
Oh, lover, have you brought me gold?

264
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,356
Enough to set me free?

265
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:33,878
Or have you come to see me hangin'

266
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,508
On the gallows tree?

267
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,598
Who, uh... who is she?

268
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,559
Oh, that's Ann Logan. She arrived
during dinner with George Hayden.

269
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,076
The big fella that rode with you
and Blake Randolph?

270
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,628
- That's the man.
- I saw him over there.

271
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,473
She works for him at the Hawk and Horn.

272
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,232
- That's a tavern.
- Oh.

273
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,392
I, uh, notice that the ladies
didn't crowd around.

274
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,190
I don't suppose she has a very good time,
yet Hayden takes her everyplace.

275
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,430
- Does he go everyplace?
- Oh, yes.

276
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,351
He is a very important man.

277
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,479
He's in charge of the river traffic
and the men who handle it.

278
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,632
Those river men can be annoying
when in large groups.

279
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,679
Yes, I thought that little scuffle
over the jug developed mighty fast.

280
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,716
It's exactly what I mean.

281
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,475
I understood that, uh,
Randolph owned the riverboats.

282
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,597
He does, but Hayden controls the men.

283
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,356
Yes, we get along very well with the settlers,
the people who live around here,

284
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,876
but, you know,
those river men just seem to resent us.

285
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,999
You were quite a handy man with
that bugle this afternoon, John Breen.

286
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,152
- Too bad you're not here permanently.
- But I am, sir.

287
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,629
I'm arranging to get mustered out here.

288
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,840
Oh, I know this is not Kentucky
but it's mighty fine country.

289
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,559
And I know I'm gonna like the people.

290
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,949
That's fine, John Breen. That's fine.

291
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,191
We need friends like you.
Have the people heard about it?

292
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,829
- Well, not yet.
- Excuse me, then. I will go and tell her.

293
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,792
 'Made up your mind
in a hurry, didn't you?

294
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,952
"'Lt's not Kentucky
but I know I'll like the people."

295
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,917
'Who do you think you're fooling?

296
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,468
'You're leaving the regiment
and everything you've known

297
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,199
'just because you kissed a girl in Mobile.

298
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,513
'Uh-oh, here she comes.

299
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,434
'Tell her.
Tell her the Colonel misunderstood.

300
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,910
'Blame it on Captain Carroll, anything.
Only get out of here.

301
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,672
'Go on, now. Tell her.

302
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,910
'Tell her goodbye. She's just another girl.

303
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,355
'What are you shaking about? '

304
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,799
Good evening, ma'am.

305
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,871
Good evening, John Breen.

306
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,520
Your Willie Paine's
a handy man in the kitchen.

307
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,591
Did you see Colonel Geraud?

308
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,398
Yes. You mustn't do it.

309
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,471
- Mustn't do what?
- Stay here.

310
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,915
- Have you talked to Captain Carroll?
- No, but I will.

311
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,037
No, don't.
Leave with your regiment in the morning.

312
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,918
- But I thought...
- Let's not talk about it tonight.

313
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,752
Not talk about it? We've got to.

314
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,600
I couldn't wait to find you.
And today I know you were glad to see me.

315
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,036
Tonight here you are close to me,
wanting to be kissed,

316
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,476
and tell me to march away
in the morning - we gotta talk.

317
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,391
All right, then, listen to me.

318
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,554
John Breen of the 2nd Kentucky passing
through, you are adventure, romance.

319
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,031
- Day after day, what will you be?
- Adventure, romance.

320
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,839
You can't come charging
into a well-ordered life...

321
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,273
A well-ordered life?

322
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,148
From the way you hold your head, the shine
in your eyes, everything hollers for...

323
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,153
- I'm going to marry Blake Randolph.
- You are?

324
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,710
He's building our home.

325
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,756
The furnishings are chosen.

326
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,313
My whole life is arranged, settled.

327
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,072
Does that mean so much?

328
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,991
What else is there?

329
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,832
There's this.

330
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,390
I hope you know what you're doing.

331
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,119
Hope so. Nobody back in Kentucky.

332
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,350
Gotta make a fresh start someplace.

333
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,512
Well, we'll be in Catawba
for the next three days.

334
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,431
Andy Jackson's gonna make a speech.

335
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,559
And if things don't pan out the way
you expect, you come a-running.

336
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,312
Thank you!

337
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,438
Good luck, Breen!

338
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,034
Tell those Frenchies they're all right.

339
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,472
Drat the luck.

340
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,313
Five years with Andy Jackson
and look at me -

341
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,231
late for formation.

342
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,558
Phew.

343
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,713
I was laying up under that big sycamore
just as comfortable as could be.

344
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,756
Didn't even hear first call.

345
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,990
You can catch them if you hurry.

346
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,911
That's what I'm fixing to do.

347
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,115
Soon as I catch my wind.

348
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,834
Maybe we could chase after them together.

349
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,558
Maybe.

350
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,517
No hurry, though.

351
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,318
I reckon not.

352
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,277
Willie, you old dog-robber, how'd you fix it?

353
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,031
Well, Captain Carroll thought
I'd better stay here

354
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,237
to see that you didn't get
into too much trouble.

355
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,914
You got your wind, Mr. Paine?

356
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,831
Just about, Mr. Breen.

357
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,354
- Shall we go?
- After you, Mr. Breen.

358
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,271
Together, Mr. Paine.

359
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,512
We have 600 miles more to go

360
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,354
We have 600 miles more to go

361
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,718
But these people want to pay here
So we think we'd better stay here

362
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,873
We have 600 miles more to go

363
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,391
Sister Hattie told me
about those Kentuckians.

364
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,917
She says they act bashful
and man you all over the place

365
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,831
and the first thing you know...

366
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,751
Chérie, don't worry about it.

367
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,149
Leave everything to Papa.

368
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,595
You must admit that there is no comparison

369
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,478
between Blake Randolph
and your penniless John Breen.

370
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,232
Yes, Mama.

371
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,276
There is no comparison.

372
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,515
Was Papa always a general?

373
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,352
Was Papa what?

374
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,149
Was Papa always a general?
I seem to remember you...

375
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,916
The first time I met your father, he was
rushing through the streets of Paris

376
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,154
wearing a funny little hat and shouting
of liberty, equality and brotherhood.

377
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,992
Then he wasn't a general.

378
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,036
He wasn't even working.

379
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,714
No one was working in Paris those days.

380
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,920
When the mob stormed into Versailles
I got separated from my mother,

381
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,629
who ran to defend the Queen
with the other ladies-in-waiting.

382
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,510
All of a sudden, I was surrounded
by a dozen ruffians all brandishing pikes.

383
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,512
Your father happened to be one of them.

384
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,876
He grabbed a hold of my arm
and he shouted,

385
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,155
"Citizens, we better get out of here."

386
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,711
- What did you do?
- I put on a funny hat and went with him.

387
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,830
Fleurette, you are the one!

388
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,756
Oh, Mama!

389
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,676
How do I look?

390
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,716
Mmm, fine.

391
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,991
Mr. Breen?

392
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,676
Where are you going with my hat?

393
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,799
Well, a fella can't wear a coonskin cap
with an outfit like this.

394
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,711
Takes a beaver.

395
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,156
That's my putting away hat.

396
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,515
- Your what?
- My putting away hat.

397
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:51,038
Three generations of Paine have worn
this hat right to the brink of eternity.

398
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,556
Be careful of it, will you?

399
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,714
That hat was given to me by my
great-great-great-grand-uncle Daniel.

400
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,916
Daniel Boone?

401
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,560
He got it for outrunning a bear.

402
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,796
Whoa, oh, oh.

403
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,269
Willie.

404
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,071
Say, uh...

405
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,038
- You don't think I'm too dressed up?
- Oh, no.

406
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,715
People like the De Marchands
dress up every night like that.

407
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,279
Good luck.

408
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,354
Don't forget to wipe your boots off
on your pants before you go in the house!

409
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,838
Good evening, sir.

410
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,070
John Breen to see
Mademoiselle De Marchand.

411
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,628
Sorry, Mademoiselle De Marchand
is not at home.

412
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,110
- You mean she's not in?
- I mean she's not at home.

413
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,998
- Then General De Marchand.
- Family is not at home.

414
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,911
I will tell them you called.

415
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,430
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

416
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,875
- Nobody home.
- Thank you.

417
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,030
Monsieur Randolph,
the General is in the library.

418
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,872
Thank you.

419
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,436
Try that sometime.

420
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,989
'Well, now you know
how you stand, don't you?

421
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,674
'You gonna let them get away with it?

422
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,276
'Why don't you take off those fancy
clothes and go back and get her? '

423
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,517
I said Kentucky whiskey
and that's what I want.

424
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,672
Seems a shame
that when a man's away from home,

425
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,558
he can't get the kind of drink he orders.

426
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,633
I've been five years running around
this country with my tongue hanging out

427
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,836
and that's long enough.

428
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,549
Double-distilled chain lightning,
Kentucky corn!

429
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,949
Not this Alabama river water.

430
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,431
Take it easy, soldier. Take it easy.
Get rid of him!

431
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,556
Easy, boys, easy.

432
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,352
- What's going on here?
- What difference does it make, mister?

433
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,273
This man's a friend of mine.
He's a mite hot-headed.

434
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,318
- If he's offended you, gentlemen...
- Offended nothing.

435
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,439
He looks mighty like the bucko
that laid me out in that scuffle yesterday.

436
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,670
- If he is...
- If he is what?

437
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,558
Gentlemen, I'm sure
yesterday's fracas was all in fun.

438
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:25,237
As for the liquor, you'll have to forgive
a man for pride in his own state.

439
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,437
My friend and I haven't
seen Kentucky for five years.

440
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,479
Naturally, you...
Well, this'll pay for the...

441
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,710
...excellent Alabama rum that was spilled.

442
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,756
This'll buy a drink for the house.

443
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,876
- What do you say, gentlemen?

444
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,270
- Will you join me?
- No.

445
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,193
Put your money back in your pocket.

446
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,436
Got it all on, haven't you?

447
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,519
- Nobody's drinking with you.
- Why not?

448
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,479
You're not gonna be here long enough
for sociability’s, Mr. Breen.

449
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,278
- We've met before.
- I remember.

450
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,715
You had a difference of opinion
with my friend.

451
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,791
I remember that too.

452
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,598
Stay out of this, Willie.

453
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,150
Where's your regiment, Mr. Breen?

454
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,437
Well, a day's march from here -
Catawba, I guess.

455
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,796
Nobody hangs around Demopolis
unless they've got a job.

456
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,519
Nobody's got a job unless they work for me.

457
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,433
- So you're not hanging around Demopolis.
- I told somebody I was.

458
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,353
You won't like it. It can get awful unpleasant.

459
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,795
We just went through
five years of unpleasant.

460
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,075
That's why I'm bothering to tell you.

461
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,311
You're a man that knows trouble
when he sees it.

462
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,597
So why don't you pack your things
and get out of here?

463
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,831
By morning, you'll be back
with the other solider boys.

464
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,150
I'm sure they miss your singing.

465
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,635
What do you think, Mr. Paine?

466
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,349
I don't know.
Mr. Hayden's a mighty convincing talker.

467
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,476
I see what you mean.

468
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,233
Any more talking would be a waste of time.

469
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,515
It sure would.

470
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,672
Hold it.

471
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,959
Don't touch those men.

472
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,429
Come on. Break it up. Blackie, stop it.

473
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,954
Hello, John Breen.

474
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,951
Hello, uh...

475
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,276
Oh.

476
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,191
You sing nice.

477
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,111
What are you doing?

478
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,555
I'm trying to help you.

479
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,596
I know this man.

480
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,148
Why don't you tell them who you are?

481
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,516
Why don't you tell them, ma'am?

482
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,478
Six years ago in Kentucky, wasn't it?

483
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,677
You have a wonderful memory.

484
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,355
Just a moment and I'll tell you
exactly where it was.

485
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,396
Lexington, that's it.

486
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,711
You were working for Calvin Buford,
locating boundaries or something.

487
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,916
That's right - you're a surveyor.

488
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,791
Don't be a fool, George Hayden.

489
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,916
This man's here on business.

490
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,035
All right, solider, now you can buy.

491
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,951
Come on, everybody. Belly up.

492
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,516
I tell you, I don't know her at all.

493
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,036
The only time I saw her before
was at the festival.

494
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,156
You sure made a lasting impression.

495
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,312
She come charging down them stairs
like a scared doe.

496
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,598
If you don't know her, what's all this talk
about Lexington and surveying?

497
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,229
Willie, you know I don't know
anything about surveying.

498
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,630
Well, it looks like you'd better start learning.

499
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,349
- It's real.
- It sure is. Who sent it?

500
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,513
United States Department of War,
Washington, D.C.

501
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,953
Nice of 'em.

502
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,670
Goes to show you what kind of service
us heroes can expect from our government.

503
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,797
If we knew how to use it, we can go to work.

504
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,155
I wouldn't worry too much about that.

505
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,198
Nobody else around here
knows about them either.

506
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,077
Evening, ma'am.

507
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,832
Been hoping you'd call.

508
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,275
- Would you have a chair?
- No, thanks.

509
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,432
Mmm, but I'll have a cup
of that good-smelling coffee.

510
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,272
Yes, ma'am.

511
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:29,316
I couldn't leave you dangling after you
carried it off so beautifully at the tavern.

512
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,436
I did nothing, ma'am.

513
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,353
You handled the whole thing... beautifully.

514
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,317
Here you are, ma'am.

515
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,437
Excuse the mug. We ain't very fancy here.

516
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,913
You're talking to a girl who
learned to drink Alabama rum out of a jug.

517
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,108
Mmm. That is good coffee.

518
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,873
It oughta be. I started with coffee this time.

519
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,191
Willie's used to making coffee
out of hickory nuts.

520
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,716
Well, why don't you go see
about the horses?

521
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,758
I'll go see about the horses.
Excuse me, ma'am.

522
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,077
Your friend is a tactful man.

523
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,709
My friend is a Kentuckian, ma'am.

524
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,712
And how about
those surveying instruments?

525
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,791
They belonged to someone I knew.

526
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,190
He surveyed most of this country
before the French arrived.

527
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,271
Where is he now?

528
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,875
Gone. He lost his life
when his cabin burned down.

529
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,632
Oh.

530
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,553
Drunken negligence
was the verdict by Hayden's jury.

531
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,596
Well, that's too bad, ma'am.

532
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,275
It is, considering
he never took a drink in his life.

533
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,672
We met in Kentucky.

534
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,228
We were to be married in Mobile.

535
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,108
When I didn't hear from him,
I came to Demopolis.

536
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,191
George Hayden had these instruments

537
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,033
and turned them over
with the story of the fire.

538
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,917
I didn't believe his story.

539
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,673
I stayed around to find out
what really happened.

540
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,149
And doesn't Hayden ever suspect that...

541
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,674
When he's with me, no.

542
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,952
At other times, there's a man
named Beau Merritt who is his watchdog.

543
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,157
The man on the stairs at the Hog and Horn?

544
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,958
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

545
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,715
But as his name implies,
Beau has his weakness.

546
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,553
I manage to slip away occasionally.

547
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:25,950
Perhaps the presence of another surveyor
will bring the truth out in the open.

548
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,712
It's likely to, ma'am.

549
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,679
But if what you suspect is true,
I'm in a little trouble.

550
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,475
I realize it isn't your fight.

551
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,120
If you'd rather not help, I'll understand.

552
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,589
I didn't mean it that way, ma'am.

553
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,593
You rescued me and my friend
from a very unpleasant situation tonight.

554
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,752
The least we can do is repay that obligation.

555
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,469
And besides, as Mr. Hayden says,
we do need a job.

556
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,516
Thank you, John Breen.

557
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,476
Good night, ma'am.

558
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,915
- Good night, ma'am.
- Good night.

559
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,950
You reckon you've got a weakness?

560
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,595
- If I have, I don't know what it is.
- Well, I do... women.

561
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,797
We don't know enough about them things
to fool anybody.

562
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,031
Well, sure we do.
You've seen army surveyors work.

563
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,475
You grab that stick and go out that way

564
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,393
and I look through this thing
and wave at you.

565
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:30,315
Why don't you grab that stick
and I'll look through here and wave at you?

566
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,755
- Kind of silly, isn't it?
- Kind of.

567
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,831
Well, I still don't like Hayden.

568
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,592
How much longer
have we got to do this?

569
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,955
Till something happens.

570
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,592
Whoa!

571
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,756
Well, it happened.

572
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,792
Aaargh!

573
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,676
I'll get out. Go on.

574
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,518
Did you know Breen is surveying
the French grant?

575
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,431
Of course.

576
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,875
I've got Beau keeping an eye on him.

577
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,712
Who's he working for?

578
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,476
That should be plain enough - Geraud
found him a house, gave him horses.

579
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,313
- Drink?
- Uh, no, thanks.

580
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,039
You came to me with a great idea.

581
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,113
"Let's move the boundary stakes
on the Frenchmen," you said.

582
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,273
"Let them settle on the wrong land,
clear it and build.

583
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,476
"And we'll take it away from them."

584
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,869
Yes, but I changed my mind.

585
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,030
But I didn't change mine.

586
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,395
It's still a great idea.

587
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,471
And I'm ready to move in.

588
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,313
I don't want to cause you any trouble, Blake,

589
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,517
but if Geraud and Breen get together,
you'll have trouble.

590
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,431
I'll be out in the cold.

591
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,399
Now, look. I promised
you wouldn't lose anything by waiting.

592
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,993
I meant it.

593
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,036
Soon Alabama becomes a state

594
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,908
and I'll see that the French get title
to the land they've settled.

595
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,752
And in the meantime?

596
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:11,073
In the meantime, I'm paying you to make
sure that nobody finds out what happened.

597
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,390
- Better?
- Some.

598
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,916
Where's the regiment?

599
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,957
They'll be at Catawba
for the next three or four...

600
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,794
- Why?
- Oh, I was just thinking about Kentucky.

601
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,511
The grass is knee-high to a yearling.

602
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,160
The blue jays are pecking
at the persimmons

603
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,754
and everything is peace and quiet.

604
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:48,193
Ma's baking bread and you can smell it
all through the house.

605
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,637
Down in the barn, Pa's sitting up
with an old red mare

606
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,792
that's groaning way down deep.

607
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:01,789
Tomorrow morning, the neighbors
will come riding in to see the new foal.

608
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,957
It's no use, Willie. I got my neck bowed.

609
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,874
Well, can't we just stop this foolishness
and sit under a tree?

610
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,999
The sun ought to feel
mighty good on a bowed neck.

611
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,911
Now you're making sense.

612
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,956
I'll go gather up the tools.

613
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,632
Now what?

614
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,472
Some kind of a marker.

615
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,351
- Good thing you had your neck bowed.
- Yeah.

616
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,954
A fella oughta carry a gun around here.

617
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,990
- Hi, wrestler.
- Hello, Kentucky.

618
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,393
Hunters.

619
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,789
Papa, Papa! What is it?

620
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,871
It is nothing, child. Go inside.

621
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,949
Your arm, monsieur. Papa, he is wounded.

622
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,190
Come. Come, monsieur. This way.

623
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:02,472
Mademoiselle Fleurette! The gown
for the wedding - she didn't forget.

624
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,949
But, Marie, you forget -

625
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,235
my arm, my sore little wound.

626
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,151
Oh, monsieur.

627
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,357
Mademoiselle Fleurette, poor John Breen
has the wound, but I can fix him up.

628
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,192
I'm sure you can.

629
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,272
- Here's the dress I promised you, Marie.
- Mademoiselle!

630
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,399
It’ll have to be altered.
Go put it on. I'll be there to help.

631
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,438
It's beautiful. Thank you, mademoiselle.

632
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,272
So, you turned little Marie's head, huh?

633
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,749
As she says, I have the wound.

634
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,274
Oh, you're hurt.

635
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:00,433
- How did this happen?
- I fell down a hill.

636
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,476
You must be careful, John Breen.

637
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,111
I tried to see you last night.

638
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,918
I told you it would be difficult.

639
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,310
My father and Blake Randolph
are settling the marriage contract.

640
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,152
You can't marry him!

641
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,518
Marriages have been arranged this way
in France for hundreds of years.

642
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:21,912
But think of the road outside Mobile,
the carriage, the festival.

643
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,514
- You can't marry him.
- But I must, unless...

644
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,793
Oh, Blake Randolph!

645
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:35,316
- You were going to tell me something.
- No, not now, please.

646
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,356
Perhaps my mother...

647
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,112
Have a shot?

648
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,832
Had one.

649
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,431
That is wonderful.

650
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,115
That's nothing, ma'am.
Sometimes I take just a pinch of s...

651
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,078
- Oh, good afternoon, Monsieur Breen.
- Good afternoon.

652
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,879
Your friend and I are exchanging recipes.
Go ahead, Monsieur Paine.

653
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,598
After the pinch of salt.

654
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,116
You mix it good, put it in the oven and bake.

655
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:33,433
Leave out the wheat flour, fry on the stove,
and you've got cornpone.

656
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,876
Excuse me, Madame De Marchand.
May I talk to you? It's important.

657
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,712
Of course, Monsieur Breen.

658
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,476
- Well, go look after the horses.
- I'll go look after the horses. Excuse me.

659
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,875
Fleurette was going to tell me something
when Blake Randolph rode up.

660
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,712
She said that perhaps you would...

661
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,315
You will admit that Blake Randolph
is an exceptional man.

662
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,516
- Wealthy, considerate...
- Yes, ma'am.

663
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,354
For instance, tonight he's bringing
some fiddlers to the house

664
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,592
just because I happened to like
the American music at the festival.

665
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,989
By the way, Monsieur Breen,

666
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,550
what is the difference between
a violinist and a fiddler?

667
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,474
I don't know, ma'am,
except a violinist tucks it under his chin

668
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,755
and a fiddler braces it against his arm.

669
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,956
Are you a fiddler or a violinist?

670
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,952
Neither, ma'am.
I don't know one note from another.

671
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:26,750
Willie's a fair hand with a bow.
Fiddled his way through the last five years.

672
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,116
- Too bad we won't be seeing you.
- But, ma'am...

673
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:34,352
Please, my daughter and Blake Randolph
are ready. Excuse me.

674
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,471
- We'd better pick up that surveying stuff.
- Sure.

675
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,516
I wonder who's chasing who.

676
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,236
You reckon somebody's trying to scare you?

677
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,916
Huh! You're acting like a hooked trout,
flapping your tail and getting no place.

678
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,798
Why these Frenchies got you
hog-tied and kitty-holed.

679
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,075
They do things different in their country.

680
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,799
Maybe. But they ain't in their country.

681
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,998
Now, if you was in Kentucky
and you sure enough wanted that girl,

682
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,036
what would you do?

683
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,474
Mr. Paine, you're wonderful.

684
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,596
We're going to a party!

685
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,432
Yah!

686
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:06,039
Uh-uh. Fiddling gentlemen
through the side door, please.

687
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,308
- Good evening, Charles.
- Evening, sir.

688
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,675
- Good evening, Charles.
- Good evening, Colonel.

689
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,390
How do you do, gentlemen?
I'm Knox Brown from up Tuscaloosa way.

690
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,233
I'm Willie Paine from Kentucky,
and my friend here...

691
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,392
Abner Todd's about to introduce us.
Get your fiddles out.

692
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,630
- Well...
- We're all gonna play this first.

693
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,392
- No...
- Don't worry. Shh!

694
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,914
What I'm trying to tell you...

695
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,155
Ladies and gentlemen,

696
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:41,951
for a starter, the whole kit and caboodle
is going to warm up on Devil's Hiccup.

697
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,315
- I've gotta get out here...
- Don't worry.

698
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,550
That happens to everybody the first time.

699
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,473
Ready?

700
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,631
I'd like to get you dancing.

701
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,314
Extra men, help clear the chairs, please.

702
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:53,359
Monsieur Breen,
you are to go to the summerhouse, sir.

703
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,078
Thank you.

704
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:58,709
This'll be different.
You'll soon get the swing of it.

705
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,430
Pair off - lady and gent - four pairs together
in a square, with room for dancing.

706
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,030
Good evening.

707
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,678
Oh.

708
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,951
Yes, I sent for you,

709
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,715
to tell you Mademoiselle Fleurette and I
are going to be married tomorrow.

710
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,268
You forced your way into this house tonight.

711
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,669
That's between you and your host.

712
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,309
Any further attempt on your part
to contact Fleurette, however,

713
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,311
is a personal affront to me.

714
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,960
- Is that clear?
- Quite.

715
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,076
I'll be just as frank.

716
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:46,277
I'm not only contacting Fleurette
the first possible moment

717
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,670
but I'll do my darnedest
to keep you from marrying her.

718
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,436
You know, I wondered about you -
a solider one day, a surveyor the next.

719
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:58,513
You're upsetting a very delicate situation
in Demopolis, Mr. Breen.

720
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,636
I'll need it plainer than that.

721
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,278
That's plain enough.

722
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,590
Just don't crowd your luck too far.

723
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,433
Just a minute, Mr. Randolph.

724
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,556
We haven't settled anything, have we?

725
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,596
I honestly didn't think we would.

726
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,636
We could, mighty easy.

727
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,950
I don't threaten good.

728
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,679
Looks like you're one shot up on me.

729
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,228
I'll concede that.

730
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,470
Now...

731
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,711
any time you're ready, just grab for that gun

732
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,189
or the one you've got in your pocket.

733
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,794
I don't carry a gun, Mr. Breen.

734
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,795
Well, then, that makes it what we call
a Kentucky stand-off.

735
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,916
Let's see how lucky you are.

736
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:45,074
I, uh, never trust to luck.
I'm a businessman.

737
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:48,948
- That's bad business.
- If it's bad for you, it's good for me.

738
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:49,677
But you won't press your advantage.

739
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,514
You see, Mr. Breen, you're a hero.

740
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,910
In the heroic tradition,
you wait for me to make the first move.

741
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,956
Personally, I think that's rather foolish.

742
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,634
In your position, I wouldn't hesitate.

743
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,073
Strange, isn't it?

744
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,435
The very thing that makes you a hero

745
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,559
is the very thing that makes you vulnerable
to a man like me.

746
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:13,838
You and I never will understand each other.
That's too bad, in a way.

747
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,673
Together we could... Oh, well.

748
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,719
I was prepared to offer you a year's contract,
to leave immediately,

749
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,394
for more money than Geraud is paying you.

750
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,596
- Geraud?
- Yes.

751
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,956
I should have known
you'd be heroically obstinate.

752
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,836
Too bad, soldier.

753
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,078
Who were you gonna shoot?

754
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,071
The winner.

755
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,794
By the way, whose side are you on?

756
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,996
Mine.

757
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,712
Good luck.

758
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,315
- Thank you, Major.
- My pleasure, mademoiselle.

759
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:26,358
- May I have a cool drink, please?
- Certainly.

760
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,153
Come on out here.

761
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,356
I wanna talk to you.

762
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:53,309
Now, you're not marrying Blake Randolph.
You're marrying me. Is that understood?

763
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,789
Yes, John Breen, now it's understood.

764
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,599
I have been waiting for you to come for me.

765
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,956
You know I've wanted to see you.
Why didn't you send word?

766
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,996
Did you need word?

767
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,672
Supposing I hadn't shown up.

768
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,433
Then I would have been wrong in waiting.

769
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,595
We're gonna get out of here tonight.

770
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,240
I'm coming back for you after the party.

771
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,197
Where are we going?

772
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,350
Does that matter?

773
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,432
No, I... I thought perhaps my mother...

774
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:26,069
- Are you frightened, Fleurette?
- A little.

775
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,037
Don't be.

776
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,588
Forget old times and traditions.

777
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,432
This is a new country,

778
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,636
a new world for you.

779
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,712
That's better. Now you're smiling.

780
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,756
Yes, John Breen.

781
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,474
I'm thinking about a funny little hat.

782
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:08,318
Good evening, Mr. Breen.

783
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,351
Good evening, sir.

784
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,996
That is a good-looking team.

785
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,389
Yes, sir. Borrowed.

786
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,597
Of course. Geraud always had
an eye to good horseflesh.

787
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,433
And then, a cavalryman - why not?

788
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,309
One of the first paragraphs
of the Emperor's Field Service Regulations

789
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,152
went something like this -

790
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,277
"In the absence of reliable information
to the contrary,

791
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:51,876
"always assume that the enemy will act
with good judgment."

792
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,428
And though you and I are not enemies...

793
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,158
No, sir, of course not.

794
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,708
I feel that we should be better acquainted.

795
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:01,075
- I'd like that, sir.
- Good.

796
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:06,109
I have a small cabin over there
where I spend a great deal of my time.

797
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,317
- Would you care to see it?
- I'd appreciate it, sir.

798
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,152
Thank you.

799
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,870
By the way,
your General Andrew Jackson

800
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:23,077
has translated the Emperor's
Field Service Regulations into English.

801
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,475
Yes, sir. I know the quotation, sir.

802
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:35,829
The bust you recognize, of course.
My favorite study of the Emperor.

803
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,673
I used the stump of the first tree cut down.

804
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:41,911
This is the first cabin built.

805
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,991
We call it the sanctuary.

806
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:48,437
Some member of every family in the colony
had a hand in the building

807
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,556
or contributed to its furnishing.

808
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,469
That was wielded by a Cossack hetman
at Borodino, Russia.

809
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:01,313
Ugh! Makes me cold to think of it.

810
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,995
Moscow - a frozen, bloody retreat.

811
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,589
The beginning of the end.

812
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:13,549
Then Elba, Waterloo followed
in quick succession.

813
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,471
That was the symbol of revolt.

814
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:24,429
Hundreds like it were worn by the people
of Paris during the French Revolution.

815
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,194
A last desperate effort to live.

816
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:33,556
I say desperate
because we have so much to learn.

817
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,790
Land-hungry men are watching us with envy

818
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:40,192
as we try to raise grapes and olives
in this rich soil.

819
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,038
Ever thought of other crops?

820
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,634
Cotton or tobacco?

821
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:52,236
Of course, but we don't know anything
about cotton or tobacco.

822
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:56,393
Our only chance to last long enough to learn

823
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,758
is by cementing relationships
with influential American friends.

824
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,957
Which brings us,
in a rather roundabout way,

825
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,917
to you, John Breen.

826
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,116
I'll do everything I can to help, sir.

827
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,395
Then don't run away with my daughter.

828
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,231
Sit down, please.

829
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,993
Two weeks ago, you didn't know her.

830
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,878
Hadn't even heard of her, nor she of you.

831
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,632
You want to ruin my plans

832
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:24,757
and jeopardize the happiness of people
who are looking to me for guidance.

833
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:27,308
That's why I'm appealing to you.

834
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:31,757
Look at it as I see it.
Here you are, penniless but in love.

835
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,796
On the other hand is Blake Randolph -

836
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,440
wealthy, also in love,
perhaps not so passionately,

837
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:40,559
yet enough to throw his important influence
on the side of my people.

838
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,995
Give me time, sir. I'll match his influence.

839
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,958
In another place, under different
circumstances, perhaps.

840
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,759
But here and now, it is impossible.

841
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:53,038
Why is it impossible?
Why are you rushing her into this marriage?

842
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,872
Just a minute, Mr. Breen.

843
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,632
I'm not rushing her.

844
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:00,076
Blake Randolph met us
when we first landed in Mobile.

845
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,879
He and his friends entertained us lavishly.

846
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,714
His people, his boats,
helped us move upriver and build.

847
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:10,713
For the past year, he devoted himself
to our interests -

848
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,233
unselfishly -

849
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:17,599
when he could very easily have been
concentrating romantically upon Fleurette.

850
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,511
Ah, maybe you're right.

851
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,477
Maybe I have been rushing her.

852
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,948
Maybe I should give her more time.

853
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:27,235
Maybe we should both give her more time.

854
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:32,314
I'm doing what I believe
is best for my daughter and my people.

855
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:37,394
If you love her, love her enough to stop
what you are doing and leave Demopolis.

856
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,034
If you'd locked her up, I'd know what to do.

857
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,873
I don't know how to fight these other things.

858
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:50,351
My habit of obeying is too strong
after these last five years.

859
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,193
I should take Fleurette. I could, you know.

860
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,677
Yes, I think you could.

861
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,671
But you won't.

862
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,957
You won't see her or talk to her, will you?

863
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:07,909
No, I won't. At least, not tonight.
But don't you marry her off tomorrow either.

864
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,190
I can't very well postpone the wedding.

865
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:16,673
But until then, I'm willing to listen
to anything you have to say.

866
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:19,672
I guess that'll have to do for now.

867
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,676
But I'll be back.

868
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:48,715
Yeah.

869
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,913
Crown it.

870
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,756
I don't know why.

871
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:20,074
Maybe I am rushing her.

872
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,355
Maybe the General's right.

873
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,628
All those people.

874
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,676
But Blake Randolph...

875
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,513
Why am I supposed to be working for you?

876
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,431
Well, I don't know. Are you?

877
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,397
Randolph seems to think so, sir.

878
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:39,349
That's funny. I was going to ask you
to do a little job for me.

879
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,749
Here's a copy of the grant for this land

880
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,957
and a letter from the man
who surveyed it originally.

881
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,554
"An act of Congress to set aside..."

882
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:50,712
- When did you get this, Colonel?
- About two days ago.

883
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:55,635
I was afraid that some of our people
might have settled outside the boundaries.

884
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:59,998
You might save me time and expenses
if you'll check for me.

885
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:02,913
- But...
- We'll do everything we can, Colonel.

886
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,753
- Here, Willie. We'll get right on it.
...tell him.

887
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,717
- Good night, Colonel.
- Good luck, gentlemen.

888
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:10,598
Why didn't you let me say
we're not surveyors?

889
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,194
That letter was written
by the original surveyors.

890
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,918
I heard that...

891
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,551
- The Colonel received it two days ago.
- I heard that too but...

892
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:22,108
Are you beginning
to smell something, Mr. Paine?

893
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:27,194
Yes, Mr. Breen, and it don't smell like
a cabin full of burning surveyors either.

894
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:30,716
- Let's make a little call on Miss Ann Logan.
- Yes, sir.

895
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,315
- It ought to be a big day.
- Sure.

896
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:20,594
I've got my mademoiselle
all picked out - that little Marie.

897
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:54,790
You packed, Annie? We'll have
a day's start while Hayden's busy.

898
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,919
- Shouldn't we see how it turns out?
- You know how it'll turn out.

899
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,514
- Come on, get going.
- Wait a minute, Beau.

900
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,272
We've stood it this long.

901
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:07,069
Blake Randolph paid off tonight.
There's a lot of money in that safe.

902
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:09,435
We can stand it another day.

903
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,910
- We can use that money, can't we?
- Yes.

904
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,752
$100,000, Beau.

905
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,956
London, Paris, New York, Mobile.

906
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,871
Just you and me, Beau.

907
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,796
All right, honey. You can have tomorrow
to get the money.

908
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:27,269
But tonight, let's concentrate on us.

909
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,156
Hold it, Beau.

910
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,519
John Breen!

911
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,194
Now, what about this business
with the French?

912
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,077
Don't do it, Beau.

913
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,355
She's making a fool out of us.

914
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:44,398
- Us?
- Sure. What do you think I'm doing here?

915
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,597
You don't believe him, do you, Beau?

916
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:52,196
Sit down, Annie. Leave him alone.

917
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,029
- What do you want to know?
- Everything.

918
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:04,795
- What's the matter with the French?
- Don't tell him.

919
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:07,110
He won't shoot. Will you, John Breen?

920
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,952
Well, I don't know.

921
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,634
But now's a good time to find out.

922
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,636
The French are on the wrong land.

923
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:19,269
- Hayden's men are moving in tomorrow.
- No more, Beau.

924
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:23,956
- How did they get on the wrong land?
- The stakes were moved.

925
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,671
Ann?

926
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:30,149
Ann?

927
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:32,037
Couple of you men, up here!

928
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:33,917
Hayden, Hayden!

929
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,752
I may need you.

930
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,796
Guess I'll have to leave you.

931
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,791
Willie!

932
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,834
Carter, Joe, couple of you men, come on!

933
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:49,357
Get Colonel Geraud
and bring him to De Marchand's.

934
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,875
The General is not at home, sir.

935
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:46,599
Sorry to break in on you like this,
General, but you're in trouble.

936
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:49,752
- I am, huh?
- You French are on the wrong land.

937
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,512
Impossible, Mr. Breen.

938
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,353
The land has been staked out
by government surveyors.

939
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:57,557
- Somebody moved the stakes.
- Why didn't you say this before?

940
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:00,712
I didn't hear about it until a few minutes ago.

941
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,997
You gotta believe me, General.
You're in real trouble.

942
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,389
- Geraud? Colonel Geraud?
- Yes, sir?

943
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:10,314
Here, Mr. Breen claims
that we are on the wrong land.

944
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,994
- You mean all of us?
- Yes, sir.

945
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:16,038
The river men are moving in
on you in the morning.

946
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:19,954
- How do you know that, Mr. Breen?
- Beau Merritt told me.

947
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,992
Beau!

948
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,036
I'll handle this.

949
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,512
Evening, gentlemen.

950
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,388
- I'll take that, Mr. Breen.
- It's all right, General.

951
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:40,233
Haven't had time to reload it anyway.

952
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,356
Well, Mr. Hayden?

953
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:46,035
This man broke into my tavern
and shot my men. I want him.

954
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,710
That when he found out about tomorrow?

955
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,438
What's that?

956
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:53,318
Mr. Breen says we French
are on the wrong land.

957
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,278
- Where'd he get that idea?
- Mr. Merritt told him.

958
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:58,794
Do you say anything like that, Beau?

959
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:04,238
No. Breen is crazy. I caught him
in Ann's room and tried to get rid of him.

960
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,790
- Satisfied, General?
- Not quite.

961
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,519
I'd like to have your assurance
about the land.

962
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:14,070
- After all, Mr. Breen is a surveyor.
- Him a surveyor?

963
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:17,869
He's nothing but a rear rank private
trying to run a bluff.

964
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:20,758
Mr. Breen, are you a surveyor?

965
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,350
You satisfied now, General?

966
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:41,000
Well, Mr. Breen, are you a surveyor?

967
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:43,230
- No, sir, I'm not, but...
- That's enough!

968
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,958
Bring him along, Beau.

969
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,837
- The reason...
- Bring him along!

970
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,112
Colonel? Colonel Geraud?

971
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,989
Mr. Breen, I've tried to get you
to leave this country once.

972
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:19,437
Yeah, I remember. Same night
you sent Ann Logan to get me to stay.

973
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:23,229
Funny thing about that.
I didn't send her. Was her own idea.

974
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:25,834
- Turned out mighty good too.
- Yeah, it did.

975
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:30,152
You got Randolph's money.
Tomorrow you'll get the French land.

976
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:33,073
Beau told you all about it, didn't he?

977
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:37,199
Too bad you weren't five minutes later at
the General's. Might've convinced him.

978
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:40,795
Oh, don't worry about that.
I'll convince him for you tomorrow.

979
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:45,636
Good night, Mr. Breen.

980
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,518
- You mean I can go?
- Any time.

981
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,319
- What makes you think I will?
- Because that way you get a chance.

982
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,868
A small one, but a chance.

983
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,633
Well, never let it be said I didn't take it.

984
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,352
Mind if I ride with you?

985
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:16,353
Not at all, not at all.
We're glad to have you with us.

986
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,396
- I'm not intruding, am I?
- No.

987
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:21,552
We weren't going to do anything
we can't do later.

988
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,836
Aren't you afraid to keep him overnight?

989
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,037
Afraid not to since Geraud
made such a point of it.

990
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,315
Bring over a couple of glasses.

991
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,231
A special - big night.

992
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:46,992
Mmm.

993
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,833
Beau, you came through
real nice at the General's.

994
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,751
Well, I just told what happened.

995
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,354
- Sure, I know. Pour yourself a drink.
- Thanks.

996
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,551
I've been thinking that maybe
you ought to take a little trip.

997
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,472
- Why?
- Save answering questions.

998
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:10,233
Here's 500. Go burn it up.

999
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,880
Thanks, Hayden. Thanks a lot.

1000
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,871
Forget it. Drink hardy.

1001
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:52,350
- Fleurette.
- Blake.

1002
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:56,433
I know it's against tradition
to see the bride before the ceremony

1003
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,351
but I wanted to talk to you.

1004
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:02,228
Well, of course, Blake. We haven't had
much time together, have we?

1005
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:05,756
- My father and...
- Your father and I have been very busy.

1006
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,478
But now that's all settled.

1007
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:11,599
I'm going to devote the rest
of my life to making you happy.

1008
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:14,148
I just left my house for the last time.

1009
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:17,630
When we get back,
our new house will be finished

1010
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:21,076
on the bluff overlooking the river
where I first saw you.

1011
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:23,913
You have made a very bad bargain, Blake.

1012
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,956
We could never be happy.

1013
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,152
Breen?

1014
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,711
I can make you forget him.

1015
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,870
I was going to go away with him last night.

1016
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:40,157
I'd go with him now if he came for me.

1017
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:43,229
I'm sorry but that's the way it is.

1018
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:47,670
You, Father, nothing can change it.

1019
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,750
I said I can make you forget him.

1020
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:00,832
No, please.

1021
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,638
Take it inside, please.

1022
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:19,156
Geraud, you can send those people home.
The wedding's been postponed.

1023
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:22,118
Those people are not interested
in weddings, Mr. Randolph.

1024
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,031
Then what are they doing here?

1025
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:28,511
The General has ordered the French
to assemble here in case Breen is right.

1026
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:32,870
But the dress, it is not finished.

1027
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:36,032
- Lots of time after we get there.
- Oh, my needles.

1028
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:38,953
- Oh, your needles. Here!
- Jacques, hurry!

1029
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:46,073
- Why must we hurry so?
- General's orders.

1030
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:53,235
- It's straight ahead!
- Hyah! Ya!

1031
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:30,038
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

1032
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:22,276
This is perfect. Can you think
of anything we've overlooked, Ann?

1033
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:23,998
Yes - Willie.

1034
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:27,277
- Willie?
- Willie Paine, Breen's friend.

1035
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,318
You mean Fatty.
Why, he wouldn't...

1036
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,550
Hello, Blake. Come in, come in.

1037
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:35,712
What's this about you
moving in on the French land?

1038
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,598
- What is it?
- That story Breen told last night.

1039
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:40,318
- Oh, Breen.
- Yes.

1040
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,868
He wasn't working for Geraud like you said.

1041
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,997
- Could've been wrong.
- Who was he working for?

1042
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:48,878
- Search me. Why don't you ask him?
- I will.

1043
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,520
- Where is he?
- Back there.

1044
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:56,276
You're just in time. He's gonna be shot
trying to escape in a few minutes.

1045
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,591
Brought you company, Breen.

1046
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,116
We know you weren't working for Geraud.

1047
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,872
Who hired you?

1048
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:18,837
Why don't you ask Hayden?

1049
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:20,876
Holler if you need me.

1050
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,356
Hayden! Hayden!

1051
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,954
Oh, you don't
need me that soon.

1052
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:32,077
You beginning to understand,
Mr. Randolph?

1053
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,792
I tried that.

1054
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:05,749
Running fight from Jacques's cabin, sir.
We lost one man - Armand Grandis.

1055
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,951
Gentlemen, to your posts.

1056
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:16,358
Mademoiselle, the dress,
it is not finished.

1057
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:18,396
Oh, don't worry about it, Marie.

1058
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:22,992
Madame, we run?

1059
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:24,638
No, Marie, we fight!

1060
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,672
I thought we were gonna
stay away from the General.

1061
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:33,228
Well, we're here, aren't we? Round 'em up!

1062
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:43,230
Why am I locked in here?

1063
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,878
- What was that firing all about?
- Tell him, Ann.

1064
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:50,428
Tell him what the river men are doing.

1065
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,351
Why? You told him, didn't you?

1066
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:00,714
How could I let myself get in a fix like this?
I walked right into it.

1067
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,758
A fool, that's what I am. A complete idiot.

1068
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:08,389
- Why don't you say something?
- You seem to be covering the ground.

1069
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,152
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

1070
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:13,038
I thought I had some influence
in this territory.

1071
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:14,917
Sure, I moved the stakes.

1072
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,956
Then I met Fleurette.

1073
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:22,149
Breen, we've got to get out of here.
Hayden! Hayden!

1074
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:38,228
Oh. This what you call
an Alabama stand-off?

1075
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,992
Mm-hm.

1076
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:43,197
- Looks like a job for a hero.
- Or a fool.

1077
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:46,033
At any rate, it's no job
for a businessman.

1078
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:47,758
No, sir.

1079
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,832
Hello, hero.

1080
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:38,876
Hello yourself.

1081
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,270
I guess I should've stuck to business.

1082
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:56,036
Crystal!

1083
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,595
Stop that Kentuckian.

1084
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:16,554
Hah! Hah!

1085
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:19,519
Thank you, ma'am!

1086
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:34,790
Lady, we'd better get out of here.

1087
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,836
That's what Papa said to Mama.

1088
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,760
John Breen, Mademoiselle Fleurette.

1089
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:15,512
Now, Geraud.

1090
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:37,996
Colonel Geraud!

1091
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:05,310
Come on, you Kentucks!

1092
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,552
Good shot, Breen!

1093
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:16,677
- What kept you?
- Andy Jackson couldn't find his pants.

1094
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,956
John Breen! John Breen!

1095
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:43,278
No, wait a minute!

1096
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:16,918
Willie... thanks.

1097
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,956
Give way.

1098
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:23,311
Right and left face.

1099
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,356
Left trail, forward!

1100
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,192
Hut!

1101
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:52,310
- We can't take him with us, can we?
- Uh-uh, John Breen.

1102
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:55,836
Only 600 miles more to go

1103
01:33:55,920 --> 01:34:00,550
Only 600 miles more to go

1104
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:02,915
We have buttoned up the drama

1105
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,991
So goodbye to Alabama

1106
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:09,073
We've got 600 miles more to go
