1
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,528
Ready?

2
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,835
Ready?

3
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,141
All right. Drive slow.

4
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,547
Stay in formation.

5
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,667
Sorry about that.

6
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,330
Don't have to apologize to me.

7
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,180
Three and a half. Seventy-five?

8
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,976
Now four. I got four and a half quarter.
Now a half.

9
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,619
Four and a half and seventy-five.
Now five. Five...

10
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,521
Seventy-five. Sold to the party
in the corner. T and C.

11
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,555
Let's roll them, boys.
Bring the next package in.

12
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,718
And here we have
the first package in...

13
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,059
Those your calves, Uncle Herb?

14
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,864
Yeah, every one of them's mine.

15
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:54,634
Where did you get them?

16
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,798
Crossed them from Mexico.

17
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,543
I got 30 appaloosas.

18
00:02:58,711 --> 00:02:59,973
Appaloosas?

19
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:03,013
- Studs and mares.
- You got yourself some stock there.

20
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,411
- Yep.
- Hey, Jim.

21
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,419
- I've been trying to reach you all morning.
- Yeah?

22
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,216
- Well, they tested out your animals.
- That's good.

23
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,258
Yeah, but the four best ones have dourine.

24
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,851
It's about the same as clap.

25
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,893
- Dourine?
- It's clap.

26
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,928
Damn.

27
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:26,063
Well, I shot and burned the four of them
and I cleaned out all the manure.

28
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,731
- You owe me $30.
- How long will the rest be in quarantine?

29
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,103
Six weeks.

30
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,674
You have to wait for your money then.

31
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,277
Well, make it easy on yourself.

32
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,345
Hey, where did you get them?
In a cathouse?

33
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:50,219
You know, Jim, you could sit right here
in my place and do my bidding for me.

34
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,023
I get tired of coming out here.

35
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,689
Seven forty-five and a half.
Seventy-five. Now eight.

36
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,528
Thank you. I'll think about that.

37
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,432
I got problems
with my own operation.

38
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,072
Now nine. Now forty-eight.

39
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,606
Yeah, I gotta see a man about a loan
in Tucson.

40
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:06,108
- I'll be up there later on tomorrow.
- Okay.

41
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,169
Hello, Mr. Kane.

42
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,005
How are you?

43
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:43,239
He told me about the quarantine.
I'm awfully sorry. What was the matter?

44
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,311
- It was the dourine.
- What's that?

45
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,750
Listen, it's no worse than a bad cold.

46
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,982
I think he can see you now.

47
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,824
- I'm Jim Kane.
- You don't have to tell me.

48
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,298
Oh, well, I'm sorry.

49
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,767
Well, we're having quite a day.

50
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:10,204
I don't know about that.
I got this note coming due pretty soon.

51
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,643
The day after tomorrow.

52
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,475
See, I don't know what's gonna happen
about that because I'm not in the chips.

53
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,946
I don't even have a nickel.

54
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,443
Maybe you could just
pay the interest on it.

55
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,215
I don't have a nickel.

56
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:27,053
I guess we can carry another 30 days
without the bank falling on its ass.

57
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,126
No, it's six weeks.

58
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,456
- Six weeks?
- My quarantine's six weeks.

59
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,058
Fine, then.

60
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,160
- Well, I appreciate that.
- Yeah.

61
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,137
Look, maybe next time
you could stop farther south...

62
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,299
...and bleed them yourself first.

63
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,172
Or maybe test them before you buy.

64
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,342
Well, I guess.

65
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,785
There must be some way of doing it
before you get to the border.

66
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,880
Well, I'll just sure keep my eyes open.

67
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,890
Which is what you're saying, I guess.

68
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,262
Well, I'll see you in six weeks, then.

69
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:07,994
- I'll be here.
- All squared away, as far as I can see, Jim.

70
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,495
Okay.

71
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,279
Well, hi, Jim.
Where you been hiding?

72
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:32,951
I haven't been hiding.
I just need a room, is all.

73
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,457
Fine.

74
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:37,187
I need it on credit too,
because I owe Will Orr $30.

75
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,738
Well, you can have the maid's room,
top floor.

76
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,470
You can understand
that I gotta have a roof over my head.

77
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,576
- Of course.
- Got to be good to myself too, you know.

78
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:45,351
You know, I been thinking about what
you were talking about and then it hit me.

79
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,618
You see, I don't know how to bid.

80
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,752
Oh, you learn real fast.

81
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:55,190
Well, I can learn how. But when?

82
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:59,304
I mean, if you gotta sit there all the time
and tell me when...

83
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,372
...you might as well be doing it yourself.

84
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,134
How are you two dudes doing?

85
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,770
- How are you, Stretch?
- What do you say, Herb?

86
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,712
Yeah.

87
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,617
Listen. Somebody I want you to meet.
Won't take but a couple of minutes.

88
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:21,622
- Well, who's that?
- He's a friend of mine. He's in the know.

89
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,195
He's downstairs with a car.

90
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:47,209
I told Stretch I'm not about to
talk business up there in the club.

91
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,378
I'm not about to tip my hand
for everybody to see.

92
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:53,582
Jim, this here is Bill Garrett.
He's a big buyer from Amarillo.

93
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,488
Flew here this morning
in a Cessna.

94
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:59,961
I've been in plenty of clubs with
flocking on the walls. Glad to meet you.

95
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,826
Hey, Bill,
he got himself a moniker too.

96
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,697
Oh, what's that?

97
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,330
They call him a Chihuahua Express.

98
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,276
Oh, they call you that, huh?

99
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,672
No, Stretch does.

100
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:16,747
- Well, that must come in handy in a row.
- How do you mean?

101
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:21,850
Well, I mean, a guy figures
that you're the Chihuahua Express.

102
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,012
Like that.

103
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:31,158
They could also think that
I was named after that dinky dog.

104
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:34,523
I'd like to step right in here
and say, ain't nobody gonna think...

105
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:38,500
- I don't care what anybody thinks anyway.
- Let's just drop the subject.

106
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:43,074
I'd like to buy me
some Mexican cattle, Mr. Kane.

107
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,938
I'm talking about rodeo cattle.

108
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,638
How many?

109
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,447
About 250 head is how many.

110
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,853
They tell me the best, they're running
down around Rio Alamos in Sonora.

111
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,724
- Yeah.
- Jim...

112
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,761
...it pays $2 a head commission,
plus expenses.

113
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,388
Now, when did you ever see
that kind of money before, huh?

114
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,502
- Well, I've seen...
- I'll give you the money to buy them.

115
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,162
Part now and part later.

116
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,605
Of course you get your commission
when you bring them to Hermosillo.

117
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,438
Then I need my expenses
up front too.

118
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:23,173
- Well, you're gonna get those.
- You'll get everything.

119
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:24,915
How soon do you want them?

120
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,245
Well, I'm gonna say four weeks.

121
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,117
But if you could've had them
here yesterday, I'd be happy.

122
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,927
- What, are you staying here in...?
- Motel.

123
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,960
Out in Samoa.

124
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,091
Well, look, I'll let you know tomorrow.

125
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:45,203
- He wants to let us know, Bill.
- I may be leaving for Chicago at 4.

126
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,339
- Oh, yeah?
- You let me know in the morning.

127
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,739
Well...

128
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:51,869
I'II...

129
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:53,536
Okay.

130
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,791
I don't know
exactly what to tell you, Jim.

131
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,457
I can talk all day,
but I gotta make some money.

132
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,725
You go to work for that dude
and you're gonna have problems.

133
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,529
You see, he was... He was friendly.

134
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,266
He's a hustler.

135
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:23,573
But you gotta go
by your first impression.

136
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,941
- What did he want?
- Some rodeo cattle out of Rio Alamos.

137
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:31,708
You'd be better off breaking pisshead colts
than you would working for him.

138
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,352
Well, it's a job, Uncle Herb.

139
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,420
I'm not talking about a career.

140
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,581
You can get a job breaking pissheads.
Frank Spring's got some.

141
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,624
- Nope. Closed him out.
- Really?

142
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,058
- Couldn't get insurance on himself.
- Well...

143
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,028
He ain't busting a pisshead one.
They just closed him out.

144
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,293
Still I wouldn't get in bed
with that Garrett whozis.

145
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,735
Well, I'm not gonna get in bed with him,
I'll say that much.

146
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,189
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

147
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,518
I had to make a couple of business calls.

148
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,121
Well, that's all right.

149
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,762
- I met a fella.
- Yeah?

150
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,798
- Well, that's not the end of the story.
- What is the end of the story?

151
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:26,096
Well, you're a cheater, he says.
You're not all that honest.

152
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,502
You got an opinion about that?

153
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:33,272
Well, I got a private view.

154
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,508
What is this private view?

155
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,509
- Well, I think not.
- Well, why did you ask, then?

156
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,812
You gotta trust your first impression.

157
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,588
Well, fine.

158
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,054
Fine.

159
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:50,027
If somebody cheats me,
I'll hit him with a Stillson wrench...

160
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,858
...and shove him down a culvert.
- Yeah?

161
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,360
Yeah.

162
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,899
You talk that way, intimidating...

163
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:00,129
...and I'm gonna move on down the line
and not even listen to you.

164
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,867
- You talk like that and...
- Well, listen, I'll stop, then.

165
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,447
I gotta go and see a guy.

166
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,709
I leave at 4.

167
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,608
I'll be right with you.

168
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,244
Is your friend pushing
a lot of hamburgers in there?

169
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,516
Hi, Jim.

170
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:49,952
Hey.

171
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,830
You wanna do a nice thing?

172
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,399
What?

173
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,597
Well, I can't pay my alimony.

174
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:12,535
You're gonna make every payment.

175
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,474
Well, I don't know about that.

176
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:19,584
Well, I've got confidence in you.

177
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:28,958
You see, what I came down here is that
I think we can be more friendly.

178
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:33,420
No, l... No, I can't be
any friendlier with you.

179
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,798
It's okay. We used to be married.

180
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,998
I don't see why not.
I'm as good as that rummy in there.

181
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:41,764
How do you know so much about him?

182
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,307
Because I hired a private dick.

183
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:50,811
- Oh, you tell me that. I don't believe you.
- No, that's true.

184
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,283
Jim...

185
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,688
...you're a baby.
- I don't know about that.

186
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:04,356
Well, I can't be expected
to get back together with a baby.

187
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,461
It's impossible.

188
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,873
Hey, sug. We got people around here
who'd like to eat today.

189
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,450
Hey, Jim.

190
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,951
You take care of me, you hear?

191
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,236
Hey!

192
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,342
I'll take your cattle, what the hell.

193
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,808
- You mean you'll pick them up?
- Yeah.

194
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,378
Well, that's my fender you're kicking,
hotshot.

195
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,312
- You watch out about my fender there.
- I'm sorry about that.

196
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:35,112
- Well, you wanna be careful next time.
- Okay.

197
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,755
Chip that paint, that yellow,
I'll never get a match.

198
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:41,450
- Well, I need some money for my expenses.
- I understand that.

199
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,121
Hop in. Come with me.

200
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,091
Come on.

201
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,925
I've gotta have your name.

202
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,227
It's regulation around here.

203
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,105
You ought to get yourself one of these.

204
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,677
I got one.

205
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,408
Been happy ever since.

206
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,627
You got the rest of the bank drafts here.

207
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,547
I'll take real good care of your cattle,
Mr. Garrett.

208
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,099
What seems to be your trouble?

209
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,600
Do you want anything with him?

210
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:53,708
Yeah. I'm looking for a guy
by the name of Leonard, but you're not him.

211
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,614
Well, who are you?

212
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,817
Well, I'm a friend of his, first place.

213
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,758
Well, he's right up there.

214
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,428
But you better leave him alone.

215
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,860
No, he'll be glad to see me.

216
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,727
He says not to bother him.

217
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,127
Well, I don't care what he said.

218
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,389
Who's that?

219
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,892
Well, it's Jim Kane, Leonard.

220
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:47,034
Oh, Jim, I'm sick as a dog.

221
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,303
Well, you don't look so good.

222
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,339
You shoot me, you'd be
doing me a favor.

223
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:56,236
- I don't think that's necessarily in order.
- Well, maybe not.

224
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,110
Maybe you're right.

225
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,114
Well, I thought you was off somewheres.

226
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:03,277
Yeah, well, I was. For a while.

227
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,219
You looking for more horses, huh?

228
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:09,326
No, I'm looking for Corrientes.

229
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:12,486
Some people want them
for rodeo purposes.

230
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,556
Horses, stock,
it's all the same thing, huh?

231
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,998
I had an idea that was what.

232
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,565
You sure got a great mind, Leonard.

233
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,242
Well, I don't know about that, but...

234
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:38,420
- I got contacts.
- Well, what are you up to?

235
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,286
I got a land deal on the back burner.

236
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,688
Oh, really?

237
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:47,161
Well, I don't have the land, but I got the...
You know, the option is the same thing.

238
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:48,959
Well, now, where is it?

239
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:52,035
Well, I just don't necessarily
tell everybody about it.

240
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,002
You can tell me. We're good buddies.

241
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:56,606
Oh, yeah.

242
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:58,876
Two peas in a pod.

243
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:02,538
Well, I need your help, Leonard,
which is why I come down here.

244
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,942
You know me, Jim.

245
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,482
That's fine.
I'm gonna need me some corrals first.

246
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,676
You got any leads on that?

247
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,992
Hey, Juan, you're making
some noise down there, huh?

248
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,685
Well, I'm having a good time.

249
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,764
You go ahead, have a good time.
I'm not about to stop you.

250
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,226
I'm having a good time
and I'm not gonna stop.

251
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,963
You have a friend
from the United States.

252
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:28,936
Oh, yeah. This here is my friend, Jim,
from Nogales.

253
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:32,133
- He come down here to make a few bucks?
- What?

254
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,005
You come here
to screw a few Mexicans?

255
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,041
Juan.

256
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:42,586
Hey, you got it right there, friend.

257
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,245
I come down here
to steal a few chili peppers.

258
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:48,723
Jim.

259
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:58,029
We have to be especially nice to him,
otherwise he won't be nice to us.

260
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:01,172
He's the son of the big turkey
down there.

261
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,476
Hey, Juan, he wants to rent some pens.

262
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:06,941
He'll have to pay for them.

263
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:10,171
He's a businessman, Juan.
He knows that.

264
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,413
If he wants them, he's gonna have to pay
like everybody else.

265
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:18,747
I'll tell you what, if he don't pay,
don't rent him the pens.

266
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,431
I don't know what's coming next,
but I'm not even listening.

267
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:37,803
- Wants to know if you'll mess with him.
- I don't wanna mess with him.

268
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,603
I'm here, is all.

269
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,947
I'd advise you not to spit around here.

270
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:21,312
You might hit a sucker.

271
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:35,222
Hey, are these pretty good pens?

272
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,395
I like them.

273
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:40,403
You only say when
you like something, huh?

274
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:44,436
That's right.

275
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,336
Well, listen...

276
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,110
...I'm gonna take your word on this.

277
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,438
This one time.

278
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,030
I'd like you gentlemen
to try one of these.

279
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:16,435
They are my favorites.

280
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,805
Thanks, Don Tomas.
We're having a good time.

281
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,411
And that's what's important.

282
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,877
That is good.

283
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,675
Excuse me.

284
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:29,681
I'm not having a lot of fun eating tortillas.

285
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:34,014
You dropped your thing on the ground.

286
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,990
Because I come to talk business, Leonard.

287
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,790
Them pens or cattle. One or the other.

288
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:46,234
You ain't gonna have any trouble.

289
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,432
Hey, Juan.

290
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:51,169
Tell this gringo how you'll
fix him up nice.

291
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:54,335
- I'll take care of him.
- Well, come on.

292
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:56,446
Come over. Tell him
you'll fix him up nice.

293
00:26:56,615 --> 00:27:00,517
- He won't have a worry in the world.
- He'll be just fine. Just fine.

294
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:03,916
See, I don't deal much with cattle.

295
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:07,783
- Which is why I need a good set of pens.
- What kind of cattle?

296
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,988
Corrientes. Two-year-olds.

297
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:14,089
What about yearlings?
I have yearlings for sale.

298
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:15,664
Can't use them.

299
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:19,594
I know a fella that can, but it's not me.

300
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:23,639
- Why not?
- It's a question of what he wants.

301
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,770
There's nothing the matter
with the yearling.

302
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:30,180
Well, why not, then?

303
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,374
The horns are too short, first place.

304
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:35,716
You buying horns?

305
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,184
Oh, you betcha.

306
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,550
- You're in the horn business?
- That's right.

307
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:41,987
Goats have horns.

308
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,620
No, thank you, though.

309
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,388
Then what do you want with horns?

310
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,164
I like to stick them in things.

311
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,799
Well, listen, you know,
you can talk all you want...

312
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:02,812
...but I'd give you 1200 pesos
for those corrals.

313
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,015
And I could not take less than 1500.

314
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,414
- Used them myself for a thousand.
- That's true.

315
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,359
He could take less, Jim.

316
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:22,566
It's only that he doesn't want to now.

317
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,463
That's true.

318
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,928
Well, I'll meet his price, then.

319
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:29,937
He's gonna be a happy fella.

320
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,076
I'm satisfied.

321
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:39,483
Leonard, come here.

322
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:43,177
You're not getting
a kickback on this, are you?

323
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,587
You're a horseman?

324
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:53,353
Yeah. I'd ride anything.

325
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,264
Even ride an armadillo.

326
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,731
A bucking horse too?

327
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,997
You're telling me.

328
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:03,906
You'll ride one of ours?

329
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,103
Now?

330
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:09,612
Yes, ma'am, if it's bareback.

331
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,644
They sure take care of her.

332
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,186
Don't let her do much.

333
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:21,723
Yeah. She must be the queen around here.

334
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:27,896
Remember, Leonard,
I got a belly full of tortillas.

335
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:30,830
You're gonna be
sitting on a buzz saw.

336
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:33,964
I won't be sitting on him long.

337
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,937
You wanna look good in Mexico,
you hang on as long as you can.

338
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,507
Yeah.

339
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:43,644
I think I'll just settle
this animal down a little.

340
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,351
Nervous.

341
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:55,789
Thank you, Leonard. I can't see
a thing, Leonard. No withers.

342
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,929
- He's got withers, you just can't see them.
- Okay.

343
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,431
Get up.

344
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,325
It's too bad your wife
couldn't join you here.

345
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,658
Oh, yeah. Well, that'd be fine except...

346
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,665
...she had her fill of me
and we're busted up now.

347
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,063
I'm sorry.

348
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:42,332
Yeah, we're divorced, if you wanna use
the technical term.

349
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,174
- Well, I'm sorry.
- That makes two of us.

350
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:53,208
You know, I travel a lot,
and I go places and I guess...

351
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:55,784
...you'd call me a loner.

352
00:30:56,154 --> 00:31:00,591
Maybe what I need is
a family to make me feel nice.

353
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:02,953
You should have a family.

354
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:07,229
Well, I got this
bad record with my ex.

355
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:09,992
Well, you don't have
to tell people about that.

356
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:11,430
Yeah, but I just...

357
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:14,731
You know, I don't want to pull
the wool over anybody's eyes.

358
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:17,397
I don't think you have to worry about it.

359
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,047
Have you always lived down here?

360
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,688
Yes.

361
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,354
Well, have you ever been
out of the country?

362
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,357
You know, Texas...

363
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:40,430
...or Chicago, around?

364
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:43,897
I went to a Catholic school in San Antonio.

365
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:48,102
Well, you've been around, then.
That's all I wanna know.

366
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:12,558
Well, she really did a job on me, Leonard.

367
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,254
Yeah?

368
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:17,729
I keep acting the way I been acting,
I'm gonna be in deep, you think?

369
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:20,871
Well, we'll be leaving tomorrow
morning.

370
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,939
Yeah. I guess.

371
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,632
You'll just have to hold onto
yourself a little longer.

372
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,141
Yeah. That's good.

373
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:32,141
I'd need a shovel to get at her, Leonard.

374
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:34,251
I'm not gonna go after her with a shovel.

375
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:38,520
Well, who said anything about that?

376
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,490
What you gotta do is
you gotta move in close.

377
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:44,753
Look around. See what's cooking,
then... out they go.

378
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,261
Boy, kicking dirt about 42 foot
in the air, huh?

379
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:50,026
A couple of loop-the-loops,
a little Mexican tailspin.

380
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:53,068
Pick them up, dust them off,
and then just...

381
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,766
Know what I mean?

382
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:00,339
Well, I don't see how that works
as a practical fact.

383
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:04,345
- But I'm prepared to take your word for it.
- Well, you can take my word.

384
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,814
When you're...

385
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,287
...laying all this stuff on some girl,
she must know you're doing it...

386
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:17,053
...when you're doing it.
- I'm gonna have to say, that all depends.

387
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,526
- On what?
- On what angle you play.

388
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:22,097
You know what I mean, angle.

389
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,161
Gotcha.

390
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,873
Boy, you're popping in
a lot of them candies.

391
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,472
You know, these things
are full of dextrose.

392
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,376
It's a big thing with athletes.

393
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:56,289
I'm running a Holley Carburetor
on top here, Jim. A quad.

394
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,196
Doesn't mean a thing to me.

395
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:02,667
Well, I'm not exactly a man to trust
when you've got me playing with a Holley.

396
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,602
I trust you.

397
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:10,345
You give me a Holley, though, I'm not
the best man for the world's fight.

398
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:18,581
Hey, are we gonna wait here all day, or do
you got some cattle to show me, Leonard?

399
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,366
Maybe you're right.

400
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:39,408
Maybe I just been shooting my mouth off.

401
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:59,628
Got some Corrientes at 10 o'clock, Jim.

402
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,856
Jesus, they're all skin and bones.

403
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,126
They're delightful looking cattle.

404
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,532
You'd be lucky if they graded
30 percent good.

405
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:10,037
- The rest is cutters and canners.
- They'd make some nice entertainers.

406
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,836
- It's not me that wants them, anyways.
- For whoever does.

407
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,604
It's the public that wants them, Leonard.

408
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,577
Not just any given individual.

409
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,774
See what you can get out of this thing.

410
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,060
Hang in there, Leonard.
Hang right in there, boy.

411
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:38,293
Just you try it. Just try it.

412
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,778
Well, here's the spread.

413
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:01,950
He wants 500 pesos for every one
of them jokers in the joker pen.

414
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:03,957
Well, I just about gagged on that.

415
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,756
How'd you go?

416
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:11,266
But I can give you my personal voucher
he'll drop to 400, easy.

417
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:13,926
Still, I don't know whether
it's worth the fight.

418
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:15,533
Neither do I.

419
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:26,406
Let's give him the 500.

420
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:32,822
And then leave.
Not say another word. Cold shoulder.

421
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,954
You kidding me.

422
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:38,753
Otherwise we'll leave a bad impression,
we come back this way again.

423
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,397
So what?

424
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:44,166
Well, you just can't buy your way
out of a bad impression.

425
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:47,532
In the first place, you're gonna run
out of cash, you go the full 500.

426
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,605
- The hell with it.
- With what?

427
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,173
It.

428
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:52,741
The hell with it.

429
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,775
I'll just dip into my own pocket.

430
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:57,873
Well, you can count on me not to tell
anybody about this.

431
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:02,076
- You can tell anyone. I'm paying the freight.
- Well, there's no future in that, Jim.

432
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,515
I don't care.

433
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:09,515
It's no honeymoon down here.
You gotta fight tooth and nail.

434
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:11,961
I'll fight. I just...

435
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:14,222
...don't wanna fight here.

436
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,672
Well...

437
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,075
...he got a real good impression
of you, Jim.

438
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,645
That's what you wanted, right?

439
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:40,416
- No.
- You said that was what.

440
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:44,225
I just said it would come in handy, is all.

441
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,461
Well, I ain't gonna split hairs.

442
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:51,363
I better take you way back
in where his family is.

443
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,905
I always feel kind of silly getting
on these things.

444
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:12,482
Hang in there, Leonard.

445
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:15,922
Nobody likes to leave home, Jim.

446
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,176
You know, I know this sounds ironic,
but I never said nothing about this morning.

447
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:54,288
Well, look, you got the cattle in the corral
out there. Why don't we go take a look?

448
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,763
Señor Valencia?

449
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,204
Jesus, they're dying on their feet.

450
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,454
I wasn't talking about their personality.

451
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,721
Hey, Leonard.

452
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:36,036
That's a beauty contest in there.

453
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,970
You betcha.

454
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,411
Of course, you don't see
what's happening now, huh?

455
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,277
The old man ain't gonna let you
touch them cows in there...

456
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,384
...unless you take the old cows too.

457
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:57,153
We don't want a lot of soup bones.
Let's get out of here.

458
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:01,025
You betcha. No. Wait a minute.

459
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:09,396
- Yeah?
- I'll give you 500 pesos...

460
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,803
...for each one of them Corrientes
in that pen.

461
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,636
I don't want nothing
to do with the others.

462
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:24,320
Hey, just tell him we can't take
those old cows into the States.

463
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:26,718
They got a presidential veto on that.

464
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,086
Presidential veto.

465
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:37,425
- Did he say eight?
- He said eight.

466
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:41,264
- Have they got a blood bank around here?
- I don't see one, Jim.

467
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:44,236
I'll give you 500 pesos for them in there.

468
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,645
He's gotta have a little something
sweeter than that, Jim.

469
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:57,913
Oh, let's pay him. This money's burning
a hole in my pocket.

470
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,993
- You gonna have to cut down on that, Jim.
- What?

471
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:11,964
In front of everybody.

472
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:16,869
- He couldn't understand us.
- He could see you undermining my position.

473
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:21,575
I see what you mean, and I'm sorry.

474
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,914
Well, there's got to be another way, huh?

475
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,608
They look like a bunch of embalmers.

476
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:31,378
I didn't say anything.

477
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,420
Well, I can give you...

478
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:40,393
...five hundred and fifty pesos.

479
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:46,199
Well, I'm not going back to my figures.

480
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,479
Oh, he's just trying to kick up a fuss.

481
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:04,280
Well, that's fine. Just fine.
We got other prospects down the line.

482
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:07,891
You know, I been counting.

483
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,117
We're gonna be short.

484
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:35,374
Hey, look at mine, how it's open, see?

485
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:51,768
Well, this ain't enough.
Stretch, I mean, it won't make it.

486
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:57,106
Well, we've got a supplement for you.

487
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,643
Supplement, a post-dated check.

488
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,837
You can cash it in two weeks.

489
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,914
That's how come it's post-dated.

490
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:11,746
- There's no amount there.
- You just fill in whatever you want, see?

491
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:15,483
I mean, we trust you, Express.
Even though you don't trust us.

492
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:18,423
Because you got a reputation to protect.

493
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:21,596
Man, you know, it sure is hot here.

494
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,892
I didn't think I could sweat, but I can.

495
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,229
Do you think you'll
get them ready by the first?

496
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:28,200
We're gonna do our best.

497
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:30,431
Well, that's encouraging.

498
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:34,336
Tell you why. I want you
to meet us in Chihuahua.

499
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,979
Chihuahua? I thought Hermosillo.

500
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:40,913
Well, Garrett had a change of mind. I mean,
business consideration, you know?

501
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:43,383
He wants them cattle
brought into Chihuahua.

502
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:45,647
Well, that's a tick zone.

503
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:48,519
If I take them into there,
they'll be quarantined forever.

504
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:55,695
He got it fixed. He "knows a man,
knows a man" kind of thing, you know?

505
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:57,697
But I don't care who he knows.

506
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:59,961
I mean, if I take them in there...

507
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:03,235
I'm telling you he's got it fixed.
Garrett ain't like you.

508
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:07,241
He ain't walking around here in Mexico
with a heat rash or something.

509
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:10,076
Let's forget about Garrett.

510
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:14,047
I want you to tell me where I can get me
one of them gals with them...

511
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,715
...you know, clickers?

512
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:20,112
The whorehouse.

513
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:23,020
- What?
- Sure. Zone of tolerance.

514
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:27,055
Man, you're out of your mind.
I don't pay for it. I go Dutch.

515
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:30,291
There's a pimp over there at the hotel.
You tell him about that.

516
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:34,131
What? You're mixed up.
I mean, I'm talking about disease...

517
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,772
...you talking about some pimp
friend up at the hotel?

518
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,498
No, he ain't no friend of mine.

519
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:42,908
Hey, you know a lot of gals around here.
Why don't you take care of it for me?

520
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:46,014
I work cattle, Stretch.

521
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:07,828
No, no, no. We rented the pens
to keep them in the pens.

522
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:10,940
We didn't rent the desert,
the desert's free.

523
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:18,308
There's hardly any grass, so the sucker
turns them out on the grass.

524
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,615
- Why'd he do that?
- Because he hasn't fed them.

525
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:30,187
He sold the feed. He says it's not true,
but I'm gonna find out.

526
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:34,296
You don't like my work, señor,
you only have to tell me.

527
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:37,426
Well, if what Leonard said is true, I don't.

528
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:40,897
What I'm saying is true.

529
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:47,301
Fine. We're putting the cattle
back in the pens.

530
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:49,378
Tomorrow, all of this will be forgotten.

531
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:52,777
- I've got a memory like an elephant.
- He doesn't forget things.

532
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,247
And that is good for him?

533
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,410
What he's saying is that you're fired.

534
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:01,054
Oh, Jim.

535
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:06,390
I don't think we ought to go that far. His
uncle is the <i>ministerio pûblico</i> around here.

536
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,793
I don't care if he's the big chief.

537
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:11,434
That's what I meant, big chief.

538
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:15,868
I still don't care. He's gonna get a
pink slip says he's fired.

539
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:31,046
I have wasted my time with you.

540
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:36,917
Well, we're both in agreement about that,
so we ought to feel pretty good.

541
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,997
Leonard.

542
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,572
You gotta run a tighter ship.

543
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:56,671
If we get our heads together
down here, Jim...

544
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,610
...we could make a lot of money.

545
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:01,945
We could eat it
with a knife and a fork.

546
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:07,420
Well, I ain't gonna check,
but they all bulls?

547
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:12,393
In this country, señor, we do not castrate.

548
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:18,290
Well, now, if I was buying,
I could give you a better price for steers.

549
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:21,335
You would be getting inferior cattle.

550
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,002
In my country, they say that...

551
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:30,272
...castration changes their mind
from ass to grass.

552
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:41,349
Maybe he didn't get that one. You
ought to translate it.

553
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,925
- Why don't we just let it ride.
- Say it was a quote.

554
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:46,221
- Let it ride.
- Say it wasn't my idea.

555
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:51,499
I've decided to let you have 19
Corrientes at 500 pesos a head.

556
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:54,867
Give you 400.

557
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,528
Your friend told me 500.

558
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,698
- No, I said...
- No. He said it was up to 500.

559
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,707
That's a distinction.

560
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:03,769
For that spotted one, though, I'd go...

561
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:06,347
...five hundred for that.
- Eight hundred and fifty.

562
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:08,177
- I couldn't take any less.
- No, 600.

563
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:10,343
I couldn't hardly pop for any more.

564
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:13,722
We cannot trade.

565
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:21,254
Lay back with old Leonard.
He'll come down.

566
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:24,093
I got a grudge against the mother.

567
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:02,372
Well, lookie there.

568
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:12,508
He's not happy, not today.

569
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:16,119
But he's coming our way.
He may try to get us to go higher...

570
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:19,016
...but I got an attitude about that.

571
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:20,622
Home free.

572
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,156
Yeah.

573
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,688
A lot of people have had
to walk that same path, Jim.

574
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,169
Those long hundred steps.

575
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:10,068
I have been waiting here for you, señor.

576
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,801
You must have been waiting six days
because that's how long we've been gone.

577
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:18,346
Yes. Yes, I have been waiting.

578
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,580
I have been waiting for you.

579
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:24,687
You're not gonna
get that one past me.

580
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:28,182
Because you haven't been sitting
there for six days.

581
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,126
Now, you quit hitting at me, friend.

582
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:41,361
I'm not a boxer
and I'm not a roundhouser.

583
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:44,367
You forgot to pay us some wages.

584
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,065
Well, two things:

585
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:50,270
First, I hired you, not them.
And second, I already paid you once.

586
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:54,042
You been sucking on that mescal bottle
so much you can't keep things straight.

587
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:59,213
You forgot to pay me some wages.
I don't work for nothing!

588
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:07,090
And you talk to me about wages.

589
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,934
Jesus Christ.

590
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:18,031
No, it's okay, boys. I got it.
Everything's gonna be A-okay.

591
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:19,800
Nobody's hurt, just a little fun.

592
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:25,143
Here's your old sombrero, pal.

593
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:31,583
Now remember, I had nothing to do with it.
Just an accident.

594
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:34,986
So leave my tires alone, huh?

595
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:47,898
Hey!

596
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:42,357
Hi, Jim.

597
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:48,926
I got something to say.

598
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:51,590
Oh, yeah? What's the matter?

599
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:56,303
There's some secret police downstairs.

600
00:52:57,707 --> 00:52:59,971
They come around
when you're in trouble.

601
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:01,508
So, what do you mean?

602
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:05,011
It means they wanna
put you away for a while.

603
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,055
What do they want with me?

604
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,892
They're gonna take you into town.

605
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:28,236
That won't do any good,
running that way.

606
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:31,533
They'll just impound your pickup.

607
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:32,936
Pickup?

608
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:38,012
Listen, I got a plan.

609
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:41,907
Seeing as how
you gotta go along anyway...

610
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,283
...why don't you let me turn you in?

611
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:53,055
It would look good for me,
help me around here.

612
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,697
I don't know about that.

613
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:57,264
- Well, the end result's gonna be the same.
- Still!

614
00:53:57,434 --> 00:54:00,301
I'm not gonna run out on you, Jim.

615
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:04,968
I'm talking about
the end look of the thing.

616
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:28,060
Now, here's how it works.

617
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:31,132
We're gonna go through that door,
right there.

618
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:07,729
Gotta see some people,
if you know what I mean.

619
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:11,863
- Who?
- I ain't gonna say in front of everybody.

620
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:24,853
Guerro Chavarin, a nephew of mine...

621
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:29,788
...has charged you
with injuries to his person.

622
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:34,092
Well, I mean, he come at me swinging.

623
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:35,629
He should've been there.

624
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:39,657
Well, he has made
a complaint against you.

625
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:45,069
But he's willing to drop the charges
if you will pay the damages.

626
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,707
I wouldn't pay him 20 cents Mexican.

627
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:50,643
You won't pay?

628
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:53,709
He could've had a pistol somewhere.

629
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:58,886
But my advice to you would be to pay.

630
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:02,491
I don't even have to think about what
I'm gonna say next, which is no.

631
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:07,495
It's a matter... It's a matter of principle.

632
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:11,862
It is a matter of 6000 pesos.

633
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,860
Well, that's a lot of pesos.

634
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,000
You must go with him.

635
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:23,870
Well, I'd rather stay here in town.

636
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,038
You will not have to leave town.

637
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:30,847
Well, then, l... I mean, I'm just going
back to my hotel by myself, huh?

638
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:35,719
We can discuss that some other time.

639
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:37,211
Say, friend, you couldn't spare
a cigarette, could you?

640
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:39,885
I ain't got one.

641
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:42,354
I'm trying to quit.

642
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:54,229
You kill anybody?

643
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:56,965
No, of course not.

644
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,541
- Just exactly what I mean.
- What did you say?

645
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:04,809
I mean, I didn't either, but here I sit.

646
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:09,045
Oh, yeah? Why?

647
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:16,150
For one, I didn't have a passport.

648
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:19,318
And two, wouldn't nobody listen to me.

649
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,556
You gotta have a passport,
you wanna score around here.

650
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:29,271
Well, I don't have a passport,
but then, I don't wanna score.

651
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:35,272
Of course, I don't mean "score"
in a big-time sense of the word.

652
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:38,039
I just mean, take in the sights
when you want.

653
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:40,114
Not stay locked up.

654
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:42,444
Well, I thought that's what you meant.

655
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:47,147
Tell them you don't need a damn
passport. They won't listen.

656
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:50,724
Well, they got their own ideas, I guess.

657
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:52,728
How's that?

658
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:55,956
All they gotta do is phone
Marshall Field's in Chicago.

659
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:59,158
They got all my damn references.
They'll vouch for me.

660
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:03,203
I got a friend, name of Leonard.

661
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:07,142
I kind of count on him to find an angle.

662
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,778
You think maybe he can find one for me?

663
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:12,278
Many as he's got.

664
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:23,649
Three thousand pesos.

665
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:26,420
Look, I only wanna sell the thing.

666
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,955
I can't do much better than that.

667
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:33,262
You gringos can get in trouble
for selling a car here.

668
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:35,802
Not that much trouble.

669
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:39,032
Still, I can get in a lot for buying one.

670
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:43,770
You don't think we ought
to share the risk?

671
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,239
No. No, no.

672
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:52,277
Well, that's how it goes, friend.
People share risks.

673
00:59:52,855 --> 00:59:54,288
Well, not around me.

674
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:58,619
You know, I really don't understand
your attitude.

675
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:04,257
Now! Now, now.

676
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,605
Where did you get the money?

677
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:15,039
I sold your pickup.

678
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:24,719
That hoodlum's out there somewhere.

679
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:27,947
Figuring up things,
getting new angles on things.

680
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,058
Yeah.

681
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:31,454
You think?

682
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:35,064
He's probably on his hands
and knees someplace, drunk.

683
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:36,994
Where?

684
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:40,498
Some dark place. Full of pulque.

685
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,660
Yeah.

686
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:49,373
Jim, you gotta understand
the character of these people.

687
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:51,979
They live a rough-and-tumble life.

688
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:55,481
They don't have a word
for "rough-and-tumble." Did you know that?

689
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:59,846
- I'd like to run him over with a car.
- Hey, now you think twice about that.

690
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:03,457
Because you'd be
the first one they'd suspect.

691
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:06,254
First on the list of suspects.

692
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:11,099
Hey.

693
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:17,573
Hey, boy!

694
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:27,610
Here. Right here.

695
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:40,390
Now, every time he sees
a rock lying in the street...

696
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:45,558
...he's gonna be thinking about you.
- You betcha.

697
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:04,810
- Do you have an account here?
- No.

698
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:08,514
The thing is,
a fellow by the name of Russell does.

699
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:10,352
Fine. Let me take your papers.

700
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:11,891
- I'll be a moment.
- Right.

701
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,865
I'm sorry, señor,
but this account has been withdrawn.

702
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:31,442
Wait, are we talking
about the same guy?

703
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:33,582
I mean, a high roller,
name of Russell?

704
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:36,776
Anything else I can do for you?

705
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,291
You have this happen much?

706
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:48,729
I don't think so.

707
01:03:13,689 --> 01:03:16,157
- You straightened out there, Jim?
- I'm fine.

708
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:18,225
You look fine.

709
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:22,859
Well, what do you mean?

710
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:27,366
Just let's get the cattle down
to Chihuahua and find those bastards.

711
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:13,170
Now, what are you gonna do
about the weight on these things?

712
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:15,503
They're for rodeo.
I don't care about weight.

713
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:18,044
The reason I asked is
they're losing weight fast.

714
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:20,944
- Maybe we could put some fill on them.
- How's that?

715
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:24,644
Starve them the last couple of days
before we get to Chihuahua.

716
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:27,118
Then fill them up with hay and water.

717
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:30,657
You think that would be right?

718
01:05:39,535 --> 01:05:42,595
You mean, could I square it
with the man upstairs?

719
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:45,172
That's not what I mean, Leonard.

720
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:40,156
- Listen, once there was this old man.
- Yeah?

721
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,358
Well, that's not the end of the story.

722
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:46,501
There's this old man and he had
an old plow, and an old mule...

723
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:51,197
...and an old dried-up prune of a wife
and a little shack.

724
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:53,638
Well, one day that mule
just up and died on him.

725
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:56,876
And you know what he said, Leonard?

726
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:00,838
He said, "Them that has must lose."

727
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:03,346
Joker, huh?

728
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:05,381
No, he was serious.

729
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:07,078
"Them that has must lose."

730
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:09,891
Who did he think he was fooling?

731
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,953
He was just expressing
a point of view, Leonard.

732
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:16,865
Well, he was a joker, then.

733
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:20,000
Well, he was there
in the scene, Leonard.

734
01:07:20,169 --> 01:07:21,830
He'd know what to say.

735
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:58,624
You can lead a "Ha-ha" to water
but you can't make them:

736
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:07,169
You know, they say
that every man has a star.

737
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:11,471
Now, a guy should find
his star out there...

738
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,945
...unless he doesn't have one.

739
01:09:14,116 --> 01:09:16,744
Which is maybe the case with me.

740
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:21,355
If what they're saying is right...

741
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:25,327
...why, guys could just follow their stars.

742
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:30,091
But not me, because I don't have one.

743
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:37,228
I didn't know what I was saying,
was that interesting.

744
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:39,601
I heard a noise.

745
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:41,572
The cattle are shuffling out there.

746
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:46,704
No. There's this one guy
calling another guy a shitheel.

747
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:50,847
Really?

748
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,385
Maybe we better go check.

749
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:57,219
Sure, him thinking that we wouldn't worry
about just a few head.

750
01:09:57,927 --> 01:10:00,418
You let that happen every day,
it adds up, though.

751
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:04,062
I got a heater.

752
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:22,978
Oh, let one of the hands go take a look.

753
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:24,380
What's the matter with you?

754
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:27,522
Well, Garrett's gonna cheat me anyway.

755
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:32,654
Trouble is, they're his cattle, not mine.
Guess somebody forgot to think about that.

756
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:45,033
Give me that thing.

757
01:11:28,183 --> 01:11:30,174
It's been fired.

758
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:33,253
The smell goes away after a few hours.

759
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:35,219
What was it?

760
01:11:35,991 --> 01:11:38,255
Well, he was shooting at somebody.

761
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:39,951
A rustler.

762
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:46,859
I don't know why, but those two
spotted ones always seem to stick together.

763
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:51,296
Buddies.
They got buddies too, Leonard.

764
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:56,706
Reminds me of two hookers I knew
in Flagstaff, or was it in Kansas City?

765
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,738
Here comes Big Red.

766
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:40,848
- Boy, that's a real high diver there.
- Yeah, he didn't seem too bad.

767
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,518
Look at the submarine he's got.

768
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:54,564
Okay.

769
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:14,317
You know...

770
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:17,425
...if I was to stay
in this branch of work...

771
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:19,959
...first I'd get me some hogs.

772
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:24,154
Because they only muss one corner
of the pen. Did you know that?

773
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:26,898
Hogs.

774
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:51,684
Now, you guys have done
some terrific work.

775
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:55,225
And maybe I can't give you
a letter of reference...

776
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:56,728
...but you got my respect.

777
01:13:57,099 --> 01:14:00,933
And if we ever get down
this way again, with any luck...

778
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:04,664
...we're gonna look specifically
for you, you, you and you.

779
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:07,068
Or if we got some friends
coming down here...

780
01:14:07,242 --> 01:14:08,971
...we're gonna put them onto you.

781
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:13,240
But either way,
no matter how you cut the slice...

782
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:17,412
...somebody is gonna be thinking of you.

783
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:22,413
If we don't have enough money...

784
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:25,389
...to pay the railroad
or the trucks when we get there.

785
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:27,552
Garrett will be waiting for us.

786
01:14:27,729 --> 01:14:30,061
But you were saying
how slippery he was.

787
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:33,696
Well, it's just in his best interest.

788
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:35,893
Here.

789
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:49,149
Tacos. Tacos, tamales.
Tacos, tamales, tacos.

790
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,047
No, I don't think so.

791
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,882
Look, come on, F.O. Pal.

792
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:28,914
Hey, did you ever think
about colored salt?

793
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:32,527
- What?
- Salt. Colored salt.

794
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:36,096
So you know when you've shaken
too much on your food, you know?

795
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:38,756
I don't think most people can tell
when it's white.

796
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:40,697
I never thought about that.

797
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:44,636
Well, there's lots of salt down there.

798
01:15:44,806 --> 01:15:47,639
And the dye you could get
from the States.

799
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:50,879
Something to bear in mind.

800
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:18,299
Hey.

801
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:23,504
You know how they call me
the Chihuahua Express?

802
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:25,873
Well, I never heard that.

803
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:29,676
Well, it's not true. I'm not.

804
01:16:30,285 --> 01:16:34,483
Well, I wouldn't worry about anybody
standing in line for the title.

805
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,718
The only reason I bring it up is just...

806
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:41,556
...one reason why I wish we were going
to Hermosillo instead of Chihuahua.

807
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:45,165
We'll go to Hermosillo later.

808
01:16:46,868 --> 01:16:48,358
Gotcha.

809
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:06,318
- Are you the ones?
- What do you want?

810
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:07,955
I have the trucks ready.

811
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:09,613
Well, where's that Russell?

812
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:11,452
- Who?
- Stretch Russell.

813
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:12,958
Who is he?

814
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:15,528
He owns the cattle.
Or a guy by the name of Garrett.

815
01:17:15,697 --> 01:17:17,756
- What's the difference?
- I don't know.

816
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:20,163
You asked for the trucks.
I have brought them.

817
01:17:20,335 --> 01:17:22,701
You want to come with me
or you pay me here?

818
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:26,429
Look, he'll be along. In the meantime,
why don't we load the cattle...

819
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:28,974
...then we'll take care
of these railroad jokers.

820
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:17,076
This is a tick area.

821
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:22,720
- We have a problem with ticks.
- That's simple.

822
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:26,088
- Where are the cattle now?
- Down in the stockyards where they belong.

823
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:30,630
Well, we will have to put them
into quarantine. For 60 days.

824
01:19:30,799 --> 01:19:33,233
- Quarantine?
- You didn't know?

825
01:19:34,302 --> 01:19:36,930
Me? Hell, I wrote the book.

826
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:42,842
This confederate of mine, this Garrett...

827
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:45,309
...he was suppose to put
the fix in with you guys.

828
01:20:25,453 --> 01:20:28,388
Don't let them boys
talk you into anything.

829
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:34,795
Yeah, but I'll bet plenty have tried, huh?

830
01:20:35,697 --> 01:20:39,064
Most who try are big shots.

831
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:41,930
Well, I'm a cattle broker.

832
01:20:42,103 --> 01:20:43,627
You smell like one.

833
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:47,972
That's silver dollars you smell, honey.

834
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:55,177
Yeah, I know what you mean.

835
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,944
You know, I come down here
for tax purposes.

836
01:20:58,119 --> 01:20:59,780
Maybe you had your own reasons.

837
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:04,050
I'll tell you, honey. I ain't gonna bury
that silver in some safe place...

838
01:21:04,226 --> 01:21:06,592
...or a lucky spot, you know?

839
01:21:07,262 --> 01:21:09,287
Señor...

840
01:21:09,965 --> 01:21:11,899
...I don't need your money.

841
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:14,831
But you need devotion.

842
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:18,762
- I should've said that in the first place.
- Stupid donkey.

843
01:21:20,108 --> 01:21:22,076
Hey, mister, shine your shoes
for one peso.

844
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:25,145
Come on, mister, only 50 centavos.

845
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:37,682
Just like I said, tick zone.

846
01:21:37,859 --> 01:21:39,451
Where are your buddies?

847
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:41,562
Oh, they'll be by pretty soon.

848
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:43,721
Well, watch out if they don't.

849
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:46,367
You think they're gonna pull a fast one?

850
01:21:47,769 --> 01:21:51,296
I never met them and shook their hands,
so I can't say.

851
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:55,869
Look, I only met them once, Leonard.

852
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:59,079
Well, we're gonna have
to stake them out.

853
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:37,615
Take a hike.

854
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,084
Hey, I know you.

855
01:23:20,895 --> 01:23:23,329
Well, lookie here. It's the Express.

856
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:25,557
- Yeah. How are you, Stretch?
- I'm all right.

857
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:30,398
Well, I'm feeling real fine
because today is payday for me.

858
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:32,062
You happy, huh?

859
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,708
Well, something gonna put a damper
on your payday.

860
01:23:34,876 --> 01:23:38,004
You know the steers you brought?
Every one of them is in quarantine.

861
01:23:38,413 --> 01:23:41,382
Well, that's exactly
where I said they'd be.

862
01:23:41,549 --> 01:23:43,414
I said it twice and then I stopped.

863
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:46,713
They're gonna be in there for 60 days.
And you know what happens?

864
01:23:46,888 --> 01:23:50,517
The bottom drops out of the rodeo market.
It just goes deader than a doornail.

865
01:23:51,326 --> 01:23:53,055
Well, hey.

866
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:58,799
I don't know about that. But then, see,
I'm not a big rodeo promoter like you.

867
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:03,094
Listen, Garrett has had to put up
another $ 1000 just to feed them.

868
01:24:03,271 --> 01:24:07,503
Now, not even can he sell them suckers,
but he can't pay to feed them.

869
01:24:08,076 --> 01:24:10,943
I don't know what to tell you, Stretch.

870
01:24:11,112 --> 01:24:13,012
We're not trying to get out of anything.

871
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:17,174
I mean, I said we gonna pay you $2 a head,
we gonna pay you.

872
01:24:18,353 --> 01:24:20,218
What you got there?

873
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:27,655
- Five hundred dollars is what I got here.
- Let me study it.

874
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:33,326
All right. That's all right by me.

875
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:36,436
I mean, you wouldn't try
to sneak nothing by me...

876
01:24:36,604 --> 01:24:39,266
...because you got a reputation
to protect, right?

877
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:42,633
How you want that, cash or check?

878
01:24:42,811 --> 01:24:44,438
I want cash, now.

879
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:54,112
You know, your...
Your last check didn't work.

880
01:24:57,225 --> 01:25:00,251
All right. There it is. Five $ 100 bills.

881
01:25:02,497 --> 01:25:04,727
You know, I gotta meet up
with somebody.

882
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:07,459
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

883
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:12,597
Now, then the next thing
that we gotta get to:

884
01:25:14,843 --> 01:25:17,641
Five hundred and sixty dollars expenses.

885
01:25:17,812 --> 01:25:19,245
- Now you...
- That's not very much.

886
01:25:19,414 --> 01:25:21,848
- Look here...
- I wrote it all down if you wanna look.

887
01:25:22,016 --> 01:25:24,314
- Now, look...
- I haven't even paid the railroad.

888
01:25:24,486 --> 01:25:27,284
I'll tell you what, you keep writing
in that book, Express...

889
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:31,414
...because we've got a 60-day quarantine
to face and we gonna face it together.

890
01:25:31,593 --> 01:25:34,528
- I'm sorry about that.
- Well, you can just be sorry about it.

891
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:37,494
We are in financial trouble
and you come to me with expenses.

892
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:40,127
No, that was part of the deal.

893
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:43,429
I had to pay them, see?
That's what makes them expenses.

894
01:25:45,273 --> 01:25:47,298
Well, I can tell you one thing:

895
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:49,841
Garrett ain't gonna like it one bit.

896
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:53,208
I don't work for nothing.
Now, I wanna get some action on this.

897
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:54,871
Be quiet. Come on with me.

898
01:25:56,251 --> 01:25:57,878
What's the matter?

899
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:03,724
Listen, I'm a middleman.
Don't you understand about middlemen?

900
01:26:04,859 --> 01:26:08,795
The steers you brought wasn't too bright.
Some of it must have rubbed off.

901
01:26:08,963 --> 01:26:12,296
Well, I don't know about that.
I gotta figure out about this.

902
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:14,298
Express, there ain't nothing to figure.

903
01:26:14,469 --> 01:26:17,404
So get your mind right about one thing:
I just work for the man.

904
01:26:17,572 --> 01:26:19,369
If he won't pay, I can't make him.

905
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:22,669
- Well, the best thing is... Where is he?
- I don't know.

906
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:25,176
Told me he had a sister once,
lived up in Denver.

907
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:28,179
Well, she's probably married
and changed her name.

908
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:30,510
Could be. But I'll tell you one thing:

909
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:34,086
I don't have time to stand around here
and talk about it, see?

910
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:41,260
Would you please do something
about this money?

911
01:26:41,563 --> 01:26:44,031
Boy, you better get ahold of yourself.

912
01:27:33,214 --> 01:27:34,579
Hey.

913
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:37,912
Are there any calls or messages
from that guy Stretch Russell?

914
01:27:48,129 --> 01:27:50,529
- What?
- It always seemed to me that I should be...

915
01:27:50,698 --> 01:27:52,495
...in some branch of detective work.

916
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:54,066
Hey, you on to something?

917
01:27:54,235 --> 01:27:56,032
Well, I operate on the principle:

918
01:27:56,204 --> 01:28:00,368
If you've found one,
you've found the other.

919
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:10,979
So here's how I worked it.

920
01:28:11,152 --> 01:28:15,418
I was just sitting on the curb back there
and Stretch walked past me. Right past me.

921
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:19,082
So I followed him.

922
01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:53,223
There's a funny smell in here.

923
01:29:16,284 --> 01:29:18,218
Mexican Western Union.

924
01:29:18,386 --> 01:29:20,251
Come on in.

925
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:33,765
Say, is there a laundry service
around here anywhere?

926
01:29:37,572 --> 01:29:40,871
- I didn't invite you into my room.
- We came in without an invitation.

927
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:43,169
Well, get the hell out of here!
Both of you!

928
01:29:43,344 --> 01:29:46,177
- You taking a bath?
- No, I'm not taking a bath.

929
01:29:46,347 --> 01:29:48,872
I happen to have a lady
in the other room.

930
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:51,712
- Now, what do you want?
- Garrett's what we want.

931
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:56,084
Well, I don't know nothing about him.
I'm only up here with a lady.

932
01:29:56,724 --> 01:29:59,557
- We've come for him. Where is he?
- You asking the wrong man.

933
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:01,854
I didn't see a lady,
but look what I found.

934
01:30:02,029 --> 01:30:04,088
Yeah, well,
there's $50 maximum in there.

935
01:30:04,265 --> 01:30:06,995
You shot the moon
on your accommodations here, didn't you?

936
01:30:07,168 --> 01:30:09,602
I bet you even got
a sunken bathtub back there.

937
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:12,301
It's an expense account item, that's why.

938
01:30:12,473 --> 01:30:15,408
You think you can tell us where he is,
because I'm pretty angry.

939
01:30:15,576 --> 01:30:20,104
- Well, I don't keep tabs on him!
- Don't make me use any of my stuff on you.

940
01:30:20,281 --> 01:30:22,476
He's right downstairs in the barbershop.

941
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:26,211
I don't wanna worry about him when
I gotta worry about what he's talking about.

942
01:30:26,754 --> 01:30:28,881
I'll stay here, Jim, just in case.

943
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:35,991
Excuse me.

944
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:38,587
Hey.

945
01:30:39,967 --> 01:30:43,164
You haven't got a real knack
with people, cowboy.

946
01:30:43,337 --> 01:30:44,565
Well, neither have you.

947
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:48,567
I don't like you busting into
my private situation.

948
01:30:48,743 --> 01:30:50,438
I busted in to talk some business.

949
01:30:50,611 --> 01:30:52,135
What business? I'm done with you.

950
01:30:52,313 --> 01:30:55,612
If you got any more to talk about,
you take it up with Stretch.

951
01:30:55,783 --> 01:30:58,513
You're the one that's gonna pay.
Now, you better know that.

952
01:30:58,686 --> 01:31:01,450
The only way you can make me
really mad is create a scene.

953
01:31:01,622 --> 01:31:06,719
You wanna talk, you make an appointment.
You don't raise hell in here.

954
01:31:10,565 --> 01:31:12,590
Hey, you didn't pay the barber either.

955
01:31:23,377 --> 01:31:27,143
Hey, don't mess them shirts. I can't find
the laundry around here, you know.

956
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:28,339
Gotcha.

957
01:31:28,516 --> 01:31:30,575
We sure had you figured wrong.

958
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:33,948
I told Stretch you had a head
on your shoulders.

959
01:31:34,121 --> 01:31:35,952
What did Stretch say?

960
01:31:36,123 --> 01:31:37,988
You ask me that now, I don't remember.

961
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:41,686
Now, you both together owe me $560.

962
01:31:41,863 --> 01:31:44,195
- Less the 40 I just took.
- I don't owe you a dime.

963
01:31:44,365 --> 01:31:46,959
Stretch made a deal, went over his head.

964
01:31:47,134 --> 01:31:48,761
- Way.
- Well, that's your problem.

965
01:31:48,936 --> 01:31:53,771
Look, son, everybody has a bad experience
once in a while.

966
01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:57,570
But you really gone off the deep end.

967
01:31:58,779 --> 01:32:01,646
Look, I gotta make a living
just like everybody else.

968
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:10,281
You coming into my room.
You leave me alone in my own room.

969
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:12,926
Listen, I want my money up front,
right now.

970
01:32:13,094 --> 01:32:17,030
You can't wait for anything.
You gotta have it right now.

971
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:18,688
You owe me money.

972
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:22,063
I wouldn't be here if you didn't.
And I wouldn't be angry either.

973
01:32:22,236 --> 01:32:23,931
You ought to straighten him out.

974
01:32:24,105 --> 01:32:26,903
Well, he don't wanna listen, Bill.
He thinks he's doing fine.

975
01:32:27,074 --> 01:32:28,371
I never said that.

976
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:31,740
See what I mean?
Doesn't leave any room for criticism.

977
01:32:31,913 --> 01:32:37,510
I been busting my ass for four weeks.
I gotta show some payment on my books.

978
01:32:38,185 --> 01:32:39,982
Look, I don't know anything about that.

979
01:32:40,154 --> 01:32:43,419
But read the papers. The bottom has fallen
out of the rodeo market.

980
01:32:43,591 --> 01:32:46,116
Everybody's gonna take a dive.
Me worst of all.

981
01:32:46,294 --> 01:32:50,890
Stretch, if I could think of a single reason
why I should pay him...

982
01:32:51,065 --> 01:32:53,329
- I mean, he don't wanna think. He's crazy.
- I tried...

983
01:32:53,501 --> 01:32:57,494
- Just give me one good reason why...
- He doesn't know what he's talking about.

984
01:32:57,672 --> 01:32:59,537
No particular reason.

985
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:12,275
You're not impressing me at all, cowboy.

986
01:33:12,453 --> 01:33:16,150
That's hotel furniture and I'm sitting here
waiting for the house dicks to come.

987
01:33:16,490 --> 01:33:18,754
But you're the one
that's gonna have to pay.

988
01:33:19,493 --> 01:33:20,824
Who the hell is he?

989
01:33:23,898 --> 01:33:27,129
Listen, there's money around here.
I smell cash.

990
01:33:27,802 --> 01:33:30,896
Let's just have a look at that money belt.

991
01:33:31,339 --> 01:33:32,931
What are you doing?

992
01:33:33,107 --> 01:33:34,972
Don't do it!

993
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:44,445
Wait. Wait. Wait.

994
01:33:57,698 --> 01:34:00,064
This is gonna hurt in a few minutes.

995
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:06,235
Son of a bitch.
Get me a cold cloth, Stretch.

996
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:10,901
I'll take a little breather here.

997
01:34:11,212 --> 01:34:13,646
This is gonna be $ 1000 worth
of bridge work.

998
01:34:14,382 --> 01:34:16,407
Maybe $2000.

999
01:34:17,685 --> 01:34:19,118
Thank you, Stretch.

1000
01:34:19,286 --> 01:34:23,188
Look, I didn't pull
any rough stuff on you.

1001
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:27,293
You know, we can stay around here
all night, if you would like.

1002
01:34:27,461 --> 01:34:29,554
No. I got some things I gotta check.

1003
01:34:29,730 --> 01:34:32,392
Well, I can stay here by myself, Jim.

1004
01:34:32,566 --> 01:34:35,797
Hey, we don't wait around
for anybody, Leonard.

1005
01:34:42,209 --> 01:34:44,643
You're gonna pay up sometime.

1006
01:34:47,715 --> 01:34:49,910
And in the meanwhile...

1007
01:34:50,718 --> 01:34:52,379
...you ain't got no dignity.

1008
01:34:56,524 --> 01:34:59,982
First and second on the list of suspects.

1009
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:06,826
What did you do that for?
Is there something wrong with my mouth?

1010
01:35:07,001 --> 01:35:10,232
Well, them horses of yours
did have the dourine.

1011
01:35:13,107 --> 01:35:15,473
Well, we better keep our mouths shut
about that.

1012
01:35:15,643 --> 01:35:17,201
Yeah.

1013
01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:31,589
Did you see me dump that television
out the window?

1014
01:35:31,759 --> 01:35:32,987
Hey, man, I was there.

1015
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:36,425
- I just run it right out the window.
- You don't have to tell me.

1016
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:41,228
Want a beer?

1017
01:35:54,014 --> 01:35:56,039
The police will have their eye open.

1018
01:35:56,217 --> 01:35:58,777
We don't have anything
to worry about now.

1019
01:35:58,953 --> 01:36:01,615
They can always find us if they want us.

1020
01:36:07,862 --> 01:36:10,330
The place is crawling with spies.

1021
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:26,212
What you thinking?

1022
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:27,847
Nothing.

1023
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:31,411
You wanna know what I'm thinking?

1024
01:36:32,586 --> 01:36:33,917
Yeah, okay.

1025
01:36:34,088 --> 01:36:36,283
I'm thinking...

1026
01:36:36,724 --> 01:36:39,249
...about a big can of yellow peaches.

1027
01:36:39,493 --> 01:36:42,360
He could have sold his car, Leonard.

1028
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:45,089
I'm talking now in a more serious vein.

1029
01:36:45,266 --> 01:36:47,234
No, he wouldn't pay.

1030
01:36:47,401 --> 01:36:50,529
No, he wanted to pay,
he just said he couldn't.

1031
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:56,098
You know, I could've cut a dollar sign
on his belly.

1032
01:37:00,414 --> 01:37:04,316
Hey, Bill. Bill. Excuse me, Bill...

1033
01:37:05,019 --> 01:37:07,010
...but I got a problem.

1034
01:37:07,922 --> 01:37:11,722
I look down, and I seem to find
a Mexican boxing glove in my hand, huh?

1035
01:37:16,530 --> 01:37:19,090
From now on, they're gonna call you
Dollar Bill Garrett.

1036
01:37:19,266 --> 01:37:21,063
You're just gonna have
to live with it.

1037
01:37:21,235 --> 01:37:25,137
You might be able to get it off with plastic
surgery, but that's up to you.

1038
01:37:25,306 --> 01:37:29,242
Do you think that would have scared him?
Scared the hell out of him?

1039
01:37:29,410 --> 01:37:31,173
Oh, I don't know.

1040
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:34,405
I don't think he would get much nookie
cut up like that.

1041
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:38,414
Then again, he might get a lot.

1042
01:37:38,586 --> 01:37:41,384
Girls would just sit there,
think he was something else.

1043
01:37:41,555 --> 01:37:44,080
But you think it would have scared him?

1044
01:37:45,426 --> 01:37:46,893
Yeah.

1045
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:49,754
Yeah, I don't know.

1046
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:57,464
Well, the only way we'll ever know for sure,
is to call him up and ask him.

1047
01:37:57,872 --> 01:38:00,306
- He won't say.
- I don't know.

1048
01:38:00,474 --> 01:38:04,433
Leonard, you come down here,
you bust your hump and what do you got?

1049
01:38:04,612 --> 01:38:06,512
You got me, Jim.

1050
01:39:55,889 --> 01:39:57,880
