822
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:52,050
HE'’’S VERY HARD TO FIND

823
01:12:52,568 --> 01:12:54,568

824
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:14,590
COME ON.
YOU'’’RE TAKING ME TO MADERO.

825
01:13:14,625 --> 01:13:16,026
WHAT?

826
01:13:16,126 --> 01:13:18,028
HURRY UP.
GET YOUR PANTS ON.

827
01:13:18,128 --> 01:13:19,995
HOW?

828
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:23,070
WELL, FIRST ONE LEG,
THEN THE OTHER.

829
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:24,535

830
01:13:24,635 --> 01:13:26,036

835
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:17,653
IN THE ANTEROOM,
MY PRESIDENT.

836
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:21,655

837
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:28,664

840

DON'’’T MAKE ME DO I

845

846
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:12,643
DON'’’T MAKE ME
GIVE PARRAL

847
01:15:12,743 --> 01:15:14,743

848
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:23,218
PANCHO, THIS IS DANGEROUS.

849

850
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:32,470

851
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:35,666
HOW COULD I HAVE
A CONFLICT WITH HIM?

852
01:15:35,766 --> 01:15:38,231
I HAVEN'’’T EVEN
SEEN THE MAN.

853
01:15:38,233 --> 01:15:40,170
NOR DID ANYONE ELSE
IN PARRAL,

854
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:42,565
UNTIL AFTER
I TOOK THE CITY.

855
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:45,240
THEN HE CAME.

856
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:49,745
CAME.

857
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:55,185
PANCHO, PLEASE DON'’’T
MISUNDERSTAND ME.

858
01:15:55,285 --> 01:15:59,025
I'’’M HAPPY YOU'’’RE HERE,
VERY HAPPY, BUT...

859
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:04,156
YOU HAVE JUST CREATED
A TERRIBLE PROBLEM.

860
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:06,697
OH? YOU DON'’’T
WANT PARRAL?

861
01:16:06,797 --> 01:16:08,797
OF COURSE I DO.

862
01:16:08,799 --> 01:16:10,580
E,
BUT WHEN HUERTA FINDS OUT

863
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:12,703
THAT YOU'’’VE COME DIRECTLY TO M

864
01:16:12,803 --> 01:16:17,673
HE WILL THINK THAT YOU AND I
ARE PLOTTING BEHIND HIS BACK...

865
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:19,775
AND THAT'’’S DANGEROUS.

866
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:22,212
WHO THE HELL
IS HUERTA, ANYWAY?

867
01:16:22,312 --> 01:16:24,780
DID HE WIN PARRAL?
NO.

868
01:16:24,815 --> 01:16:26,717
HE'’’S NO GOOD.
HE DRINKS.

869
01:16:26,817 --> 01:16:29,877
HE'’’S NOT FOR YOU,
JUST FOR HIMSELF.

870
01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:33,223
DON'’’T PUT ME
UNDER HIS COMMAND.

871
01:16:33,323 --> 01:16:35,726
GENERAL HUERTA IS HEAD
OF THE REPUBLICAN ARMY.

872
01:16:35,826 --> 01:16:38,228
WHAT ELSE COULD I DO?
I GAVE HIM MY WORD.

873
01:16:38,328 --> 01:16:40,230
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR WORD TO ME?

874
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:41,231
DON'’’T YOU
OWE ME SOMETHING?

875
01:16:41,331 --> 01:16:43,233
I TOOK PARRAL
FOR YOU, NOT HUERTA.

876
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:45,628
NO NATION
CAN HAVE 2 ARMIES.

877
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:49,031
UNDER HUERTA, ONE ARMY
IS ONE TOO MANY.

878
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:54,621
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU HAVE
AGAINST HUERTA?

879
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:04,254
I DON'’’T THINK
HE'’’S LOYAL TO YOU.

880
01:17:04,354 --> 01:17:06,256
YOU PERSONALLY KNOW
THAT GENERAL HUERTA

881
01:17:06,356 --> 01:17:09,161
PLANS TO OVERTHROW
THE REVOLUTION?

882
01:17:11,827 --> 01:17:13,829
NO, MY PRESIDENT.

883
01:17:13,864 --> 01:17:15,766
HAS ANYONE INDICATED TO YOU,
EVEN BY RUMOR,

884
01:17:15,866 --> 01:17:17,866
THAT HE HAS SUCH PLANS?

885
01:17:17,868 --> 01:17:19,269
NO, MY PRESIDENT.

886
01:17:19,369 --> 01:17:21,369
THEN WHAT?

887
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:24,775
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.
SPEAK UP.

888
01:17:24,875 --> 01:17:27,778
GET OUT OF HERE.
GET BACK TO YOUR PEOPLE.

889

I WANT FACTS.

890
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:32,225
GET OUT

891
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:33,784
GIVE ME PROOF.

892
01:17:33,884 --> 01:17:35,285

YOU PROOF, BUT I KNOW.

895
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:53,290
THAT I AM BETRAYING

896

NO, BUT...

897
01:17:56,872 --> 01:18:00,876

AND NOT ME?

898

899

ONLY ONE THING:

900
01:18:05,415 --> 01:18:07,415
DON'’’T TRUST HIM.

901

NOT LIKE YOU.

902
01:18:14,389 --> 01:18:17,327

BETTER THAT I DIE A FOOL,

904
01:18:18,929 --> 01:18:22,898

TRUSTING NO ONE AT ALL.

ENOUGH OF THOSE.

JUST LIKE THE OLD DAYS.

907
01:18:34,444 --> 01:18:38,413
ONCE AGAIN,
I'’’M ASKING FOR YOUR HELP.

908
01:18:39,915 --> 01:18:43,485
IT'’’S ESSENTIAL TO ME
TO HAVE YOUR PROMISE

909
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:45,856
THAT YOU'’’LL OBEY

TO TAKE A STEP BACKWARD?

THINK IT ADVISABLE

932
01:20:00,330 --> 01:20:01,732
TO GET UNDER WAY IMMEDIATELY,

BUT EVEN IF I HAD,
MADERO WOULD PROTECT ME,

1143
01:41:25,814 --> 01:41:30,219
BECAUSE HE WOULDN'’’T WANT A MAN
TO BE DEPRIVED OF HIS RIGHTS.

1144
01:41:30,319 --> 01:41:32,686
HE WON'’’T STAND FOR INJUSTICE,

1145
01:41:32,786 --> 01:41:35,224
SO HUERTA CANNOT
SHOOT ME TOMORROW.

1146
01:41:35,324 --> 01:41:37,324
NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

1147
01:41:38,292 --> 01:41:40,794
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

1148
01:41:43,297 --> 01:41:44,490

01:41:48,302 --> 01:41:50,302
CHIEF...

1151
01:41:50,304 --> 01:41:51,240
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

1152
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:52,241
IS TO GET THE WORD
TO YOUR MEN,

1153
01:41:52,341 --> 01:41:53,742
AND THEY'’’LL HAVE Y
OU OUTTA HERE.

1154
01:41:53,842 --> 01:41:54,743
IT'’’S THAT SIMPLE.

1155
01:41:54,843 --> 01:41:56,245
IT'’’S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

1156
01:41:56,345 --> 01:41:59,713
WELL, YOU CAN'’’T FIGHT
FOR THE REVOLUTION

1157
01:41:59,813 --> 01:42:00,749
IF YOU'’’RE DEAD.

1158
01:42:00,849 --> 01:42:05,319
I'’’M FIGHTING FOR IT
RIGHT NOW, HERE.

1159
01:42:05,354 --> 01:42:08,757
THIS IS UNJUST,
TO DEPRIVE ME OF MY LIBERTY.

1160
01:42:08,857 --> 01:42:10,857
YOUR LIBERTY?

1161
01:42:10,859 --> 01:42:13,327
WHAT'’’S THAT?

1162
01:42:13,362 --> 01:42:19,333
'LIBERTY IS THE RESPECT
FOR THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS.'

1163
01:42:19,368 --> 01:42:22,336
THAT IS WHAT
BENITO JUAREZ SAID.

1164
01:42:22,371 --> 01:42:24,273
THAT IS WHAT MADERO
BELIEVES IN.

1165
01:42:24,373 --> 01:42:26,775
THAT'’’S WHAT WE'’’VE
BEEN FIGHTING FOR.

1166
01:42:26,875 --> 01:42:29,278
NOW, IF I WALK OUT OF HERE
WITHOUT A TRIAL,

1167
01:42:29,378 --> 01:42:32,846
I DENY THAT
AND BEHAVE LIKE A BANDIT.

1168
01:42:32,881 --> 01:42:36,285
WELL, JUST WHEN HAVE YOU
STOPPED BEING A BANDIT?

1169
01:42:36,385 --> 01:42:37,751
WHAT ABOUT

UP IN CONEJOS
THE OTHER DAY?

1171
01:42:39,888 --> 01:42:44,858
THOSE MEN WERE TRAITORS,
AND HUERTA KNOWS IT VERY WELL--

1172
01:42:44,893 --> 01:42:48,123
THERE'’’S NO POINT
IN TALKING ABOUT IT.

1173
01:42:48,862 --> 01:42:51,865
WELL, WHAT ABOUT ME,

I'’’M TAKING IT ALL.

1317
01:53:21,294 --> 01:53:24,232
WELL, I CAN'’’T JUST STAND HERE
AND COUNT IT, CAN I?

1318
01:53:24,332 --> 01:53:27,736
SAY I LEAVE IT. YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY USE IT FOR?

1319
01:53:27,836 --> 01:53:29,738
TO SHOOT UP A LOT OF PEONS
WHO COULDN'’’T CARE LESS

1320
01:53:29,838 --> 01:53:31,740

01:54:40,208 --> 01:54:41,109
WHAT'’’S THAT?

1337
01:54:41,209 --> 01:54:43,076
PRESIDENT MADERO...

1338
01:54:43,176 --> 01:54:44,577
THEY SHOT HIM UP.

1339
01:54:44,677 --> 01:54:46,114
KILL HIM?

1340
01:54:46,214 --> 01:54:47,615
THEY SURE DID.

1341
01:54:47,715 --> 01:54:49,617
ONE OF HIS OWN
GENERALS, TOO.

1342
01:54:49,717 --> 01:54:51,119
GENERAL, UH...
HUERTA.

1343
01:54:51,219 --> 01:54:53,621
AND YOU KNOW WHO'’’S
THE NEW PRESIDENT OF MEXICO?

1344
01:54:53,721 --> 01:54:55,123
THE SAME GENERAL HUERTA.

1345
01:54:55,223 --> 01:54:58,126
PRETTY FUNNY GAMES
THEY PLAY DOWN THERE, HUH?

1346
01:54:58,226 --> 01:55:00,226
WHAT ABOUT VILLA?

1347
01:55:00,228 --> 01:55:02,130
YOU HEAR ANYTHING
ABOUT HIM--PANCHO VILLA?

1348
01:55:02,230 --> 01:55:04,230
YEAH, YEAH. HE, UH...

1349
01:55:04,232 --> 01:55:06,134
HE ESCAPED FROM JAIL
IN MEXICO CITY.

1350
01:55:06,234 --> 01:55:08,136
HUERTA HAS PRACTICALLY
HIS ENTIRE ARMY

1351
01:55:08,236 --> 01:55:09,602
LOOKING FOR HIM.

1352
01:55:09,702 --> 01:55:11,139
MUST WANT HIM
PRETTY BAD, HUH?

1353
01:55:11,239 --> 01:55:13,239
YEAH, I GUESS HE DOES.

1354
01:55:13,241 --> 01:55:14,642
HEY, LEE.

1355
01:55:14,742 --> 01:55:19,212
LEE, IS THIS VILLA
A FRIEND OF YOURS?

1356
01:55:19,247 --> 01:55:21,247
YEAH, I KNOW HIM.

1357
01:55:35,728 --> 01:55:39,132
WELL, AND THEN I HAD TO
FIND SOMETHING TO WEAR

1358
01:55:39,232 --> 01:55:40,668
WITH THE NEW JEWELED
COLLAR DADDY BOUGHT ME.

1359
01:55:40,768 --> 01:55:42,170
AND I WAS SO WORRIED

1360
01:55:42,270 --> 01:55:44,172
ABOUT FINDING EXACTLY
THE RIGHT THING,

1361
01:55:44,272 --> 01:55:46,174
WELL, IN EL PASO,
ESPECIALLY,

1362
01:55:46,274 --> 01:55:48,176
BUT THEN
I SAW THIS GOWN.

1363
01:55:48,276 --> 01:55:50,643
IT WAS IN A LITTLE SHOP
RIGHT CATTY-CORNER

1364
01:55:50,743 --> 01:55:52,180
FROM THE HOTEL,
OF ALL PLACES.

1365
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:55,248
OH, IT'’’S MARVELOUS.

1366
01:55:55,283 --> 01:55:56,684
T,
IT'’’S PITCH-BLACK VELVE

1367
01:55:56,784 --> 01:55:58,784
YARDS AND YARDS OF IT,

1368
01:55:58,786 --> 01:56:01,189
AND THE BODICE IS ALL
STUDDED WITH GARNETS,

1369
01:56:01,289 --> 01:56:03,756
AND, OH, I JUST LOVE IT.

1370
01:56:03,791 --> 01:56:06,259
IT FEELS SO...

1371
01:56:06,294 --> 01:56:08,761
SO SENSUOUS.

1372
01:56:08,796 --> 01:56:10,698
DON'’’T YOU
JUST LOVE VELVET?

1373
01:56:10,798 --> 01:56:12,165
VERY MUCH.
OF COURSE,

1374
01:56:12,265 --> 01:56:13,701
IT WAS OUTRAGEOUSLY
EXPENSIVE,

1375
01:56:13,801 --> 01:56:15,703
BUT I JUST
HAD TO BUY IT. ANYWAY,

1376
01:56:15,803 --> 01:56:18,171
DADDY SAYS THERE'’’S GON
NA BE A WAR IN EUROPE SOON,

1377
01:56:18,271 --> 01:56:19,207
AND THE PRICE OF BEEF

1378
01:56:19,307 --> 01:56:21,602

LEE, DARLIN'’’,

1384
01:56:39,327 --> 01:56:42,730
YOU DON'’’T MEAN TO SAY

1385
01:56:42,830 --> 01:56:45,298
DO YOU KNOW

I DON'’’T THINK SO.

01:57:21,369 --> 01:57:24,837
WE'’’RE GETTING READY
TO GO HOME NOW.

1404
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:34,880
GET RID OF HUERTA.

1405
01:57:36,349 --> 01:57:38,851
YOU SEE, WE THOUGHT...

1406
01:57:38,886 --> 01:57:41,289

01:57:41,389 --> 01:57:42,790
WE WILL BUY GUNS.

1408
01:57:42,890 --> 01:57:44,792

1410
01:57:46,394 --> 01:57:47,760
CAN'’’T YOU SEE THAT?

1411
01:57:47,860 --> 01:57:49,797
THE REVOLUTION
IS FINISHED.

1412
01:57:49,897 --> 01:57:52,265
YOU GAVE IT
YOUR BEST SHOT, CHIEF,

1413
01:57:52,365 --> 01:57:54,802
BUT AFTER ALL, HUERTA'’’

01:57:55,903 --> 01:57:57,305
AND THERE'’’S NO WAY

1416
01:57:57,405 --> 01:57:59,307

TO GO DOWN THERE AND SHOOT
UP A LOT OF YOUR OWN PEOPLE

1422
01:58:12,885 --> 01:58:15,823
JUST SO SOME OTHER DICTATOR
CAN CALL HIMSELF PRESIDENT?

1423
01:58:15,923 --> 01:58:19,392
MADERO WAS NO DICTATOR.

1424
01:58:19,427 --> 01:58:21,427
PANCHO...

1425
