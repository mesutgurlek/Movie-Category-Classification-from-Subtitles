1
00:07:34,063 --> 00:07:34,980
Oh no!

2
00:07:36,113 --> 00:07:38,082
Looks like they are at war,

3
00:07:38,202 --> 00:07:39,836
with their Turks.

4
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:43,073
I didn't know that the
Indians were on the warpath.

5
00:07:43,193 --> 00:07:46,090
- Shepherd! Shepherd, look!
- What is it?

6
00:07:53,494 --> 00:07:54,163
It's nothing.

7
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:56,709
They have their problems,
we have ours.

8
00:07:57,003 --> 00:07:57,844
Let's go.

9
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,585
THE ACTRESS, THE DOLLARS AND
THE TRANSYLVANIANS

10
00:08:19,283 --> 00:08:20,599
Hello!

11
00:09:27,805 --> 00:09:30,093
Leave the horses here.

12
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:34,690
Dear Sir...

13
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,093
two rooms, two.

14
00:09:38,058 --> 00:09:39,634
He says that he has no vacancies.

15
00:09:39,754 --> 00:09:42,958
I understood, I'm not stupid.

16
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,900
A couple of slaps might change his mind.

17
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,518
What is he saying?

18
00:09:53,638 --> 00:09:56,658
He says that Bob is not allowed,
but it's nothing, Bob will find a place.

19
00:09:56,778 --> 00:09:57,608
But why?

20
00:09:57,728 --> 00:09:59,054
Because Bob is black.

21
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:04,083
So.........

22
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:06,260
You lot go to the market.....

23
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,073
And see how things are
goin on.

24
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:12,152
- Buy some clothes for the lady.
- Traian, be careful.

25
00:10:13,091 --> 00:10:15,335
Call me shepherd Traian,
I'm older than you.

26
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,371
Go!

27
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:42,734
What does he say?

28
00:11:03,588 --> 00:11:04,505
It's beautiful.

29
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:28,771
Let's go now.

30
00:12:06,296 --> 00:12:06,793
So...

31
00:12:07,152 --> 00:12:08,768
How is it, "Shepherd Traian"?

32
00:12:08,888 --> 00:12:12,235
- How do you think? It's ok.
- Alright.

33
00:12:12,486 --> 00:12:13,633
He managed to understand, finally.

34
00:12:13,895 --> 00:12:15,221
Otherwise, he's a good boy.

35
00:13:11,141 --> 00:13:13,195
It's perfect, "Shepherd Traian".

36
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:15,043
Ion!

37
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:17,115
You should be ashamed.

38
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:18,565
Bob, close the door.

39
00:13:19,683 --> 00:13:20,633
I don't say no,

40
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,774
to giving the man a slap or two...

41
00:13:23,274 --> 00:13:24,807
But not like this,
shooting everywhere.

42
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:29,495
Instead try to say something nice,

43
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:31,632
because we are good men from
Poplaca,

44
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:33,445
who don't shoot for no reason.

45
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:53,729
Have you seen this?

46
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,974
You were prepared to
shoot him.

47
00:13:56,384 --> 00:13:57,398
Brother Traian....

48
00:13:57,743 --> 00:13:58,671
I don't wanna hear!

49
00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:01,908
I'm the oldest one here,
I'm the leader.

50
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:16,828
Must I lock it?

51
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:19,245
Well, dear brother...

52
00:14:20,173 --> 00:14:21,943
You must know that it won't be
easy for me.

53
00:14:22,063 --> 00:14:23,864
- Shepherd I think that...
- You, Romi...

54
00:14:23,984 --> 00:14:25,035
Mind your own business.

55
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:27,280
And take care of this girl.

56
00:14:27,915 --> 00:14:30,429
She will sleep here,
in the room.

57
00:14:31,897 --> 00:14:32,889
Alone!

58
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,194
This is the rule.

59
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:37,396
We will sleep together.

60
00:14:40,676 --> 00:14:41,237
Well...

61
00:14:42,187 --> 00:14:44,885
I'm going to check out
the town,

62
00:14:45,995 --> 00:14:48,024
but I think that here...

63
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:52,103
it's good to be very careful.

64
00:14:53,874 --> 00:14:56,162
Bob, come with me,
I want a beer.

65
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,471
And I don't want to
drink it alone.

66
00:15:44,058 --> 00:15:46,670
Dear Bob, I suggest that we go to take a
look at that fair.

67
00:15:47,188 --> 00:15:49,799
The last time I saw something
like that was in Vienna and Peszta.

68
00:15:50,101 --> 00:15:51,375
And it was so funny!

69
00:15:51,495 --> 00:15:52,864
Bob likes too.

70
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:55,435
Bob...

71
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:58,867
Look at her,
she's like an angel.

72
00:18:14,137 --> 00:18:14,958
Hey...

73
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,490
I think...

74
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:18,691
that they'll kill each other.

75
00:19:40,844 --> 00:19:42,833
Dear Miss, don't be upset,

76
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:46,883
because in the end...

77
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:52,727
everything will be fixed if
a person doesn't loose hope.

78
00:19:53,107 --> 00:19:56,695
And please don't cry,
your eyes are like two shining stars.

79
00:21:16,468 --> 00:21:17,602
Have you seen what happened?

80
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,540
The business with the
Indians is messed up.

81
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,888
It's their business.

82
00:21:26,187 --> 00:21:28,777
We're going to get something
to eat and drink at the saloon.

83
00:21:28,897 --> 00:21:29,602
It's your business.

84
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:01,630
Shepherd Traian, you're fucked up.

85
00:29:17,496 --> 00:29:18,135
What is it?

86
00:29:19,241 --> 00:29:19,932
What is it?

87
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:22,628
Why are you entering like this?

88
00:29:22,748 --> 00:29:25,445
It's the end of the world,
come and see the impossible.

89
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,226
Look.

90
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,967
It really is the end of the world.

91
00:29:37,952 --> 00:29:38,574
Hear?

92
00:29:39,532 --> 00:29:41,502
IS there any money left?

93
00:30:35,288 --> 00:30:36,498
Bob, stay here with me.

94
00:30:58,255 --> 00:31:00,415
God damn this whiskey.

95
00:31:01,003 --> 00:31:02,886
It's worse than death.

96
00:31:06,268 --> 00:31:08,342
Well, dear Ms. Anabella...

97
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,499
I came to tell you that I'm
very concerned about your troubles.

98
00:31:14,717 --> 00:31:16,376
I hope you don't think that I'm stupid.

99
00:31:16,863 --> 00:31:19,323
I saw that the play was just fantasy.

100
00:31:19,647 --> 00:31:21,136
It was not the first time for me
that I was at a theater.

101
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:25,013
For I was enrolled at ........
Regiment.

102
00:31:29,135 --> 00:31:30,366
So, I know what it's all about.

103
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:34,782
But those tears were real,
and they really upset me.

104
00:31:34,902 --> 00:31:36,854
Because nobody cries on command.

105
00:31:36,974 --> 00:31:38,991
Only if he has in his soul...

106
00:31:39,574 --> 00:31:40,804
a hidden pain.

107
00:31:42,361 --> 00:31:44,303
Bob....
translate what I've said.

108
00:31:53,741 --> 00:31:57,280
Your Mom and Dad,
are they alive?

109
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,861
Or, are you left alone on
the face of the Earth.

110
00:32:25,964 --> 00:32:27,713
Her father, is dead.

111
00:32:30,346 --> 00:32:32,202
Then, rest in peace.

112
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:42,038
Something wrong?

113
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,034
Dear Anabella...

114
00:32:59,617 --> 00:33:02,552
are you coming for a ride?

115
00:33:39,995 --> 00:33:42,456
Bob, listen carefully to me.

116
00:33:42,931 --> 00:33:44,204
2 beers!

117
00:33:44,636 --> 00:33:45,715
She's a good girl.

118
00:33:46,082 --> 00:33:47,852
But she's unlucky. 'Til now.

119
00:35:15,182 --> 00:35:16,045
Well, well.

120
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,592
Lots of noise outside.

121
00:35:22,645 --> 00:35:23,876
You're pretty enough.

122
00:35:26,574 --> 00:35:28,451
You still have some snowdrops.

123
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:33,782
Mind your own business.

124
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:36,209
Don't you worry about me.

125
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:39,697
I've been here for 8 years.

126
00:35:40,086 --> 00:35:43,107
It's subtle, you're
still stupid.

127
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:45,007
Oh my god!

128
00:35:45,127 --> 00:35:46,755
Ion, what's that
man doing here?

129
00:36:48,127 --> 00:36:49,357
They called them to the city...

130
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:53,156
They promised that nothing would happen,
then they killed his father.

131
00:36:56,094 --> 00:36:56,914
What are we going to do?

132
00:36:57,734 --> 00:36:58,900
He's wanted now.

133
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,597
What do you mean by:
"What are we going to do?"

134
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:05,094
Come, come, come inside.

135
00:37:08,949 --> 00:37:10,719
Ion, give him that key.

136
00:37:11,107 --> 00:37:13,503
Because he hasn't came here
just to visit us.

137
00:37:13,827 --> 00:37:15,964
He's here to ask us for help.

138
00:37:16,266 --> 00:37:17,389
We need to ask questions.

139
00:37:20,777 --> 00:37:24,554
So, he'll stay here as long as it's
necessary.

140
00:37:28,278 --> 00:37:29,465
'Till we sort everything out.

141
00:37:41,898 --> 00:37:43,322
Stop, we have time.

142
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:48,158
What do you want here?

143
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,705
Wait a second!

144
00:37:54,655 --> 00:37:56,575
Where the hell are we?

145
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,030
In the woods?

146
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:01,102
In the desert?

147
00:38:08,864 --> 00:38:10,138
Ion, don't lock it.

148
00:38:10,483 --> 00:38:11,821
I have something to do.

149
00:38:13,094 --> 00:38:14,994
And you, take care of everything.

150
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,692
- Don't forget the Indian.
- Ok, ok, go,

151
00:38:38,755 --> 00:38:40,439
There are some beautiful
places around here.

152
00:38:40,982 --> 00:38:42,407
But not like in Poplaca.

153
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,551
Unfortunately the lands in Poplaca
belong to the nobles, not to ordinary people.

154
00:38:51,698 --> 00:38:52,690
But it's not a bad thing.

155
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,877
There will come a time when the land
will belong to the people.

156
00:38:57,957 --> 00:39:00,762
It's not the end of the world yet.

157
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,288
And you must know, Anabella...

158
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:07,374
that I'll take care of you,

159
00:39:07,494 --> 00:39:09,748
like I take care of a fragile Easter Egg.

160
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,263
And you'll have
no worries...

161
00:39:13,773 --> 00:39:15,824
As long as I have these hands.

162
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:19,309
And you're talent won't be lost.

163
00:39:20,259 --> 00:39:22,331
I already see all the people...

164
00:39:22,676 --> 00:39:26,324
that are watching your shows.

165
00:39:26,808 --> 00:39:27,650
And you'll say...

166
00:39:28,384 --> 00:39:34,923
DESTEAPTA-TE ROMANE ( AWAKE, ROMANIANS )!
( the national anthem of Romania )

167
00:39:36,456 --> 00:39:37,902
What's with these people?

168
00:39:42,253 --> 00:39:43,871
What does he want?

169
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,102
No!

170
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,331
I'll take care of this.

171
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,167
Good night Anabella,
good night.

172
00:43:12,166 --> 00:43:13,634
How long are we staying
here?

173
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:17,324
Dear brother, we'll not stay
for much longer.

174
00:43:18,997 --> 00:43:20,702
I took care of you until now.

175
00:43:21,048 --> 00:43:23,271
Now, it's my time.

176
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:27,307
You see,
I'm still young.

177
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:30,692
And it will be bad if I don't
live my life.

178
00:43:31,038 --> 00:43:32,440
Do not embarrass yourself.

179
00:43:33,196 --> 00:43:35,160
- You know what those actresses are?
- Johnny!

180
00:43:35,689 --> 00:43:37,545
Or whatever the hell they
call you around here.

181
00:43:38,268 --> 00:43:39,714
If you say one more word...

182
00:43:40,167 --> 00:43:41,397
I'll leave you with
no teeth.

183
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:56,172
Romi, my son.

184
00:43:56,787 --> 00:43:57,780
It's hard, isn't it?

185
00:43:58,298 --> 00:44:01,492
Money isn't
easy to earn.

186
00:44:07,329 --> 00:44:08,624
Blacksmith!

187
00:44:08,744 --> 00:44:11,592
Give him some slaps,
if he doesn't do his work!

188
00:44:11,969 --> 00:44:14,020
Yeah, yeah.

189
00:46:49,904 --> 00:46:50,821
Because...

190
00:47:29,735 --> 00:47:31,246
Hey, leave her alone!

191
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:56,634
I see that the Americans are
eating with their hats on their head.

192
00:49:24,664 --> 00:49:26,795
Not like this, my dears.

193
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:29,659
How's it possible to eat like this?
We stay at the table, and he stays there, like a dog.

194
00:49:35,163 --> 00:49:36,862
Maybe, that's the tradition around
these parts.

195
00:49:55,444 --> 00:49:56,578
Now, I like it.

196
00:49:57,819 --> 00:49:58,871
Good appetite.

197
00:50:02,189 --> 00:50:04,132
Ion... where's Romi?

198
00:50:04,873 --> 00:50:07,221
What is he doing,
every evening he's late.

199
00:50:10,188 --> 00:50:11,699
He's missing my slaps.

200
00:50:13,951 --> 00:50:14,815
He's a man now.

201
00:50:18,834 --> 00:50:19,590
A man.

202
00:51:03,955 --> 00:51:06,416
Don't talk, I was outside.

203
00:52:51,089 --> 00:52:59,128
[shitty song]

204
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:07,462
Brother, for God's sake,
don't embarrass yourself.

205
00:53:08,104 --> 00:53:09,485
You spend all our money on
this woman.

206
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,687
Since when was it our money?

207
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:14,708
Say something,
you idiot!

208
00:53:15,841 --> 00:53:16,877
She's leaving.

209
00:53:17,848 --> 00:53:18,712
Who's leaving?

210
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,762
The actress, the theater.

211
00:53:21,258 --> 00:53:22,251
The circus.

212
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:28,269
You see?

213
00:53:30,902 --> 00:53:31,830
And what's with that?

214
00:53:37,675 --> 00:53:38,257
Translate.

215
00:53:38,797 --> 00:53:39,531
Farewell.

216
00:53:40,437 --> 00:53:42,185
Shepherd, if we're
talking about translation...

217
00:53:43,459 --> 00:53:46,027
How did you manage to
understand her?

218
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:48,002
Shitface Mucho.

219
00:53:48,122 --> 00:53:49,772
Don't talk to me
like that.

220
00:53:49,892 --> 00:53:50,333
Hey!

221
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,772
You forget about respect?

222
00:53:53,074 --> 00:53:53,635
Romi.

223
00:53:54,024 --> 00:53:55,880
You must think that
I'm very stupid.

224
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:02,177
And I wanted to take
you to a show.

225
00:54:02,523 --> 00:54:04,012
To learn something new.

226
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,789
But, here's some money...

227
00:54:09,062 --> 00:54:10,616
go get a beer.

228
00:54:11,106 --> 00:54:12,207
This is for you.

229
00:54:12,509 --> 00:54:13,458
Bob, you'll go with them.

230
00:54:14,322 --> 00:54:15,358
It's enough.

231
00:54:21,067 --> 00:54:22,103
Bob knows.

232
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:24,218
Bob sad.

233
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:31,168
This, for good luck.

234
00:54:36,968 --> 00:54:37,723
Be careful.

235
00:54:50,122 --> 00:54:51,222
My dears...

236
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:53,208
I'm very happy,

237
00:54:53,683 --> 00:54:55,301
because I can invite you
to the wedding,

238
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:57,345
and bring all of your families.

239
01:01:07,863 --> 01:01:09,503
I can't believe my eyes.

240
01:01:29,441 --> 01:01:30,854
It's the same tradition for
the Americans too.

241
01:01:30,974 --> 01:01:33,077
When they marry, first they visit
the parents.

242
01:01:37,943 --> 01:01:41,072
Well, I've seeen a lot of men like you
in my life.

243
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,258
Traian!

244
01:08:14,717 --> 01:08:16,391
I think you're finished.

245
01:08:16,784 --> 01:08:17,863
Come here.

246
01:08:41,539 --> 01:08:42,360
Not now.

247
01:09:16,258 --> 01:09:17,316
Alright.

248
01:10:13,287 --> 01:10:13,848
C'mon.

249
01:10:27,283 --> 01:10:29,118
God will punish you, BITCH.

250
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:31,708
You broke my heart.

251
01:10:37,412 --> 01:10:38,383
C'mon.

252
01:10:46,283 --> 01:10:47,794
Look, our man is coming.

253
01:10:48,247 --> 01:10:52,629
If we keep going like this,
it will take us a long time to reach Poplaca.
