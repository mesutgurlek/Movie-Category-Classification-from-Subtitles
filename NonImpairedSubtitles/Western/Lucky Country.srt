anyone this far out.

174
00:16:25,302 --> 00:16:29,611
I figured we'd be planting poor little
Jimmy in the ground by morning.

175
00:16:29,612 --> 00:16:33,079
Reckon you'd call it Providence.

176
00:16:39,654 --> 00:16:42,229
Well, I guess we could do
with a hand.

177
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,962
We don't have much.

178
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:46,664
I appreciate it.
I really do.

179
00:16:47,455 --> 00:16:51,821
The minute the boy's well enough
to ride, we'll be on our way.

180
00:16:51,822 --> 00:16:54,374
We'll earn our keep.

181
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,000
They're soldiers.

182
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,983
They're going to stay
to help out.

183
00:17:02,353 --> 00:17:06,024
What drives somebody
to go halfway around the world

184
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,959
to kill people
they don't even know?

Don't do that.

188

Come here.

189
00:17:39,988 --> 00:17:42,355
Give me that.

190
00:17:51,502 --> 00:17:54,915
Well, this was
a pretty good knife once, eh?

191
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:59,374
Never let a blade
go blunt too long.

192
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,314
Everything all right, Tom?

193
00:18:07,923 --> 00:18:10,033
With the farm?

194
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:11,908
With your dad?

195
00:18:12,752 --> 00:18:14,452
I suppose.

196
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,533
We're here to help you, son.

197
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,024
We're here to help you
and your dad out.

198
00:18:21,025 --> 00:18:24,236
So if there's anything you need
or anything you want to tell me,

199
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,136
you can.

200
00:18:26,744 --> 00:18:29,477
You know that, don't you?

201
00:18:29,478 --> 00:18:31,542
Yeah.

202
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:34,822
Reckon you could finish this up?

203
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,650
Yeah.

204
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:38,728
Yeah.

Do you think
they killed lots of boers?

212
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:30,727
It's perfectly obvious
that man's a murderer.

[Gunshot]

Tom.

216

Nat, I reckon we should
start again from scratch,

217
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:57,005
if that's all right with you.

218

You do what you think's best.

219
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:04,456
Tom and I have to check
some traps.

220

I'd appreciate it
if you stayed away from there.

Excuse me.

230
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,953
Bloody thirsty work
building your locker for you.

231

And you check that one.

232

Empty.

Well, they can't all be empty,
can they?

- Good.

but he's still...

to the stables.

some black crows, are you?

like that for a father.

Well, he thinks
he should get it different

just 'cause he's got God
on his side.

Careful, Carver.

Takes three generations
to make a gentleman.

And about three minutes
to unmake him.

Same for Henry,

except worse, I guess, 'cause
he had a wife and kids and all.

Henry sort of fell...
fell to drinking there.

That man Carver,
he drinks a lot.

Ah, he's all right.

309

He's just got that way
about him.

He's had a rough ride,
no mistake.

He got beat senseless by his father
when he was a little Tucker.

we gave it a go.

317

There was nothing there, so Henry said
we'd go back to the city to find work.

there was nothing there.

Not a bean.

You had diggers up there gnawing in the
same bone for weeks on end dressed in rags.

to strike it rich.

you wouldn't wish on a hog.

And this is just about
the worse thing I've seen.
