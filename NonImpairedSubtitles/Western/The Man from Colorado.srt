1
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,979
We ain't licked yet, major.
They'll never lick us.

2
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,010
Artillery prepared for action, sir.

3
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,092
At the command, fire at will.
Take your post.

4
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,492
Do they see the flag, major?

5
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,819
Their colonel can't help seeing it.

6
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,694
Fire.

7
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,769
You sure settled their hash, colonel.

8
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,776
- Burial detail.
- First platoon, fall out.

9
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,893
Hey, the war's over! Throw away
your carbine, soldier!

10
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,620
- Throw it away!
- The war's over!

11
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,012
- War's over!
- Hey, we won. The Rebels quit!

12
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,408
- Johnny. Hi, Johnny.
- Hi, Jericho.

13
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,411
- You okay, kid?
- Don't call me "kid."

14
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,219
All right. I wanted to know
how you made out, kid.

15
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,775
Still wet-nursing the
little brother, sarge?

16
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,249
He ain't too little.

17
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,250
- War's over, colonel.
- When did it happen?

18
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,298
Lee surrendered at
Appomattox this morning.

19
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,619
- So it's finally over.
- Yes, sir. Wonderful news, isn't it?

20
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,248
Wonderful.

21
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,376
I gave the men permission
to celebrate.

22
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,213
They seem to have been
making a pretty good job of it.

23
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,813
Dismount.

24
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,939
Further celebration will be
confined to the tent lines.

25
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,374
Yes, sir.

26
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,053
Lead off!

27
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,174
I killed a hundred men today.

28
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,136
I didn't want to.

29
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,178
I couldn't help myself.

30
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,975
What's wrong with me?

31
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,218
I'm afraid.

32
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,814
Afraid I'm going crazy.

33
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,538
No.

34
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,970
No. It was the war, that's all.

35
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,650
But the war's over now.

36
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:28,019
I can stop. I'm safe,
God helping me.

37
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,171
Come on in, Del.

38
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,170
Everything under control?

39
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,180
You look like something's
bothering you.

40
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,052
Something is.

41
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,577
Come on, out with it.

42
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,290
Just, what happened
this morning.

43
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,136
A hundred men killed,
with the war over.

44
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,818
I hate it, Del.

45
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,579
Hate it.

46
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,730
Thinking about it makes me sick.

47
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,971
Sick and ashamed.

48
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,932
They could've run up a white flag.

49
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,498
If they wouldn't,
that's not your fault.

50
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,455
Thanks for saying that, Del.

51
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,529
Forget it. Relax.

52
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,179
Well, we made it, didn't we?

53
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,332
Yeah. Sometimes I thought
we wouldn't.

54
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,377
I never had any doubts.

55
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,136
That's why you're the colonel.

56
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,056
Don't talk that way. We've been
a team, a good team, all the way.

57
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,049
We'd better check the sentry lines.

58
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,575
I thought somebody said
the war was over.

59
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,379
We're not out of the Army yet.
Come on.

60
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,893
My feet hurt.

61
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,016
You haven't been riding
on your feet.

62
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,373
When are you gonna get
the ramrod out of your back?

63
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,652
The minute we're out of uniform,
so quick your eyes will pop.

64
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,137
If the captain is ready, move.

65
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,291
Yes, sir, colonel.

66
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,979
Yes, sir.

67
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,898
- Who's in charge of this post?
- Sergeant Howard, sir.

68
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,650
- Take it easy, Owen.
- Sergeant of the guard.

69
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,019
Hi, colonel!

70
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:17,776
I mean "mister." He's a civilian
same as me. Have a drink.

71
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,131
Put this man under arrest.

72
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,976
McGuire. Judd.

73
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,652
Take his side arm.

74
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,898
Come on, Jericho.

75
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,610
- I wish I didn't have to do that.
- Nothing else you could do.

76
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,577
Jericho's been a good soldier.

77
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,972
If anybody should know better than
to drink on sentry duty, he should.

78
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,608
Meantime, how about you
getting some sleep?

79
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,058
You'd better do the same.

80
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,939
I want to start for home
first thing in the morning.

81
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,012
- The soldiers are coming!
- Here they come!

82
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,416
- Caroline. Caroline!
- Just a minute.

83
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,499
Come on, Caroline.
We don't want to miss anything.

84
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,173
Hello, Doc!

85
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,609
- Proud of your nephew, ain't you?
- You bet I am.

86
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,090
- You never thought he'd be a colonel.
- Oh, yes, he did.

87
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:00,011
- Do you think he'll take the job?
- Oh, sure he will. I know Devereaux.

88
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,695
Federal judge is a big job,
especially for a man that young.

89
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,851
A man who handles
that bunch in a war...

90
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,818
...can make law-abiding
citizens out of them in peace.

91
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,254
And that's what we want.

92
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,208
The soldiers are coming!
The soldiers are coming!

93
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,217
- Take the men on into Glory Hill.
- You leaving us, colonel?

94
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,055
For the time being, captain.
Just for the time being.

95
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,698
- Hi, colonel, glad to see you back.
- Great work, colonel.

96
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,012
- I want to shake the hand of a hero.
- Oh, welcome home, Del.

97
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,130
- How are you, my boy?
- Fine, uncle. Fine.

98
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,972
- You look it.
- Good to see you.

99
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,698
- Thank you.
- What do you think?

100
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,055
You sure aged since
I saw you last, Owen.

101
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,017
I'll take that as a compliment.

102
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,852
It's a wonderful reception.

103
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,454
You ain't seen nothing, yet.
Wait until the dance.

104
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,088
- Caroline...
- Excuse me, Miss Emmet.

105
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,739
- First dance, Caroline?
- Yes.

106
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,175
That can wait.
Business before pleasure.

107
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,331
- We want some things settled.
- What?

108
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,298
The biggest surprise you ever had.

109
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,815
- Del.
- Hello, Caroline.

110
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,448
- Everything under control at camp?
- Fine, colonel.

111
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,814
It's been a long time.

112
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,733
Three years and two hours
and 20 minutes too long.

113
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,209
Excuse us, while I make
up for lost time.

114
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,018
Certainly.

115
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:05,456
You look wonderful. Now I know why
I wanted to be a civilian again.

116
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,015
There's so many people around here
I can't hear a word you're saying.

117
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,019
- Evening, captain.
- Evening, Crawford.

118
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,812
I've been waiting for a chance
like this for a long time...

119
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,052
I know what you're going
to say, Del, but don't, not yet.

120
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,780
After all, you've been home
less than three hours.

121
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,612
Two hours and 20
some odd minutes.

122
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,736
I need more time than that.

123
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,892
- Owen kind of got a head start on me?
- That's not it, Del.

124
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:54,656
It's just that I want to think things out.
I wish you'd understand.

125
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,892
I'm trying to.

126
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,252
- There's one thing you can be sure of.
- I know, Del.

127
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,855
And I'm proud that you
feel that way about me.

128
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,935
It's just that I'm not quite sure
enough about myself. I have to be.

129
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,615
I want you to be. I'll keep asking
you every so often.

130
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,492
Thank you, Del.

131
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,057
- My dance, captain?
- Your dance, colonel.

132
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,929
You boys are missing
a fine time at the dance.

133
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,499
Well, so are you.

134
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,734
I heard they got barbecue pork, roast
beef, fried chicken, and all free too.

135
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,572
I don't want to hear about it.

136
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,533
Plenty of free drinks too.

137
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,939
- I said, I don't want to hear about it.
- Must be lots of pretty girls there too.

138
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,059
Don't matter if you're fat or lean.
They're proud to dance with a soldier.

139
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,451
Yes, sir, laugh and dance
and talk and...

140
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,778
...make a man mighty glad
he's home from the war.

141
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,693
Jericho, shut up. Just shut up now.

142
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,209
I don't know why you
don't walk to Glory Hill...

143
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,099
...and have yourselves a little drink.

144
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,410
We ain't going nowheres
and neither are you.

145
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,889
I don't trust you
as far as I could stick this.

146
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,494
Careful. I ain't even been
court-martialed yet.

147
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,409
- Don't yell.
- Now we're all in trouble.

148
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,731
I said, be quiet.
Now stay there.

149
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,816
- The colonel will have me shot.
- He'll just give you life in jail.

150
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,458
Take me with you, Jericho.

151
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,137
I'm gonna live off the country,
instead of it living off me.

152
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,497
- You want to try that?
- It's that or get court-martialed myself.

153
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,173
All right, come on.

154
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,100
We won't be needing you. Get.

155
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,209
Everybody's so proud
of you, Owen.

156
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,979
Are they?

157
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,132
It's really wonderful to have
you and Del back home again.

158
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,655
The town hasn't been
the same without you.

159
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,500
I suppose you'll open up
your law office again.

160
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,049
There's an office over
Mr. Trumbull's store.

161
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,771
Mrs. Trumbull told me to tell you
about it before you made plans.

162
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,056
You talk too much.

163
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,494
Ladies and gentlemen,
veterans, friends...

164
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,890
...l'm not telling you
any news when I say...

165
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:59,258
...this is the greatest night
in the history of our great little city.

166
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,056
We welcome and we thank...

167
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,815
...the brave volunteers who kept
the road open to the Union...

168
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,575
...and who saved our Colorado
gold from the invader.

169
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,698
But words are not enough.
Action, that's what we all want.

170
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,375
That's what this man is here for.
Mr. Roger MacDonald from Denver...

171
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,929
...representative of
the territorial governor...

172
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,931
...has a very important
announcement.

173
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,136
- Mr. MacDonald.
- Thank you.

174
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,018
Ladies and gentlemen...

175
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,648
...it gives me great pleasure
to announce...

176
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,813
...that the territorial governor, at
the request of your leading citizens...

177
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,177
...has appointed as the first federal
judge in this district...

178
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,490
...Colonel Owen Devereaux.

179
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,413
- Owen, how wonderful.
- Why didn't you tell us about it?

180
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,810
I hadn't made up my mind.
Haven't yet.

181
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,455
Now it's up to Colonel Devereaux.

182
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,176
I just want to say one thing.
I didn't ask for my job in the Army.

183
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,730
I was elected to it by the volunteers
who served with me.

184
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,537
So now, unless those same men
and you home folks here...

185
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,168
...tell me that I'm the man
you want for judge...

186
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,298
...I don't want the job,
and I won't accept it.

187
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,810
- Well, all right, folks, how about it?
- Yeah!

188
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,538
Thanks. I'll do my best
to do a good job.

189
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,173
- Thank you.
- Congratulations, Owen.

190
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,854
Your dance, judge.

191
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,894
Colonel. Jericho busted out. He
escaped. Him and Mutton McGuire.

192
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,416
- All right. Dismissed.
- Thank you, sir.

193
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,850
Well, we'll have to get back to camp.

194
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,976
Do you think it's that
important, Owen?

195
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,895
First desertion on our record and only
two days before we're mustered out.

196
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,211
- Will you forgive me?
- Of course, Owen.

197
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,055
See you tomorrow, Caroline.
As soon as I can get off duty.

198
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,770
- Good night.
- Good night.

199
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,893
Think I'll walk down the street
with you boys.

200
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,335
All right. Come along, Doc.

201
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,892
What'll you do about Jericho?

202
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,177
- Report him as a deserter.
- The same for Mutton McGuire?

203
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,289
Let's leave the rest of it to the Army
and talk a little civilian business.

204
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,139
Del, I want you to be
my federal marshal.

205
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,010
For the first time,
you're not making sense.

206
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,772
Me, a federal marshal.

207
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,651
I wouldn't have any other man in
the job. We've been a team too long.

208
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,890
Owen's right, Del. Absolutely right.

209
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:57,019
Look. In the first place, I'm not cut out
to be a marshal or anything like it.

210
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,889
Second, after bossing men around for
three years, I'd like to stay away...

211
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,893
...from any job that has
"official" tagged to it.

212
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,132
- I thought you felt the same way.
- I did and I still do.

213
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:13,250
Why, I didn't ask for the judge's job,
but I got it, and now I need help.

214
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,612
So I'm not gonna
let you turn me down.

215
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:24,497
Well, I'll think it over.
But don't count on me.

216
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,090
Why, sure I'll count on you.
The same as always.

217
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,817
Colonel Devereaux?

218
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,698
Yes. What do you want?

219
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,494
I want to look at a hero.

220
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,451
I want to ask you about this.

221
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,018
- I don't know what...
- I'm talking about the white flag...

222
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,377
...you saw my men put up
at Jacob's Gorge.

223
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,054
You could have taken
us without firing a shot.

224
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,292
But you killed them,
under a flag of surrender.

225
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,851
You killed 100 decent men.
What for, colonel?

226
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,571
For a morning's entertainment?
For pure, crazy love of killing?

227
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:16,451
You're no hero.
You're an insane murderer.

228
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,930
Well, now it's your turn to die.

229
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,734
You'll...
You'll need...

230
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,610
You didn't have to kill him. You had
him covered. He couldn't have...

231
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,331
You did see that white flag.

232
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,138
- What happened, captain?
- Who is he?

233
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,053
It's a Reb officer.
How'd he get here, captain?

234
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,609
Just a man that didn't
believe the war was over.

235
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,533
Well, it's over now for him.

236
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,974
Take care of him.

237
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,415
Yes, sir. Get going,
we'll take care of this.

238
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,810
York, Morris, Saunders...

239
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,052
Oh, Del. Del.

240
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,609
That Rebel, he didn't
know what he was saying.

241
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,011
A man hurt that bad,
and what he'd been through.

242
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,658
Tell me something, Doc.

243
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,851
Could the war get a man,
a decent man like Owen, so...

244
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,654
...well, sick that he can't stop killing?

245
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,414
Del, you've known Owen
almost as long as I have.

246
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,573
You don't mean to tell me you really
believe what that crazy Rebel said?

247
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,413
It won't do us any good
to lie to each other, Doc.

248
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,811
There's something wrong with him,
we both know it.

249
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,335
I don't like what I just saw.

250
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:53,779
But war affects different
men in different ways.

251
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,137
Time. That's what men need
when they get back from a war.

252
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:01,851
Time, and people standing by that
care about them and believe in them.

253
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,011
What if that's not enough to cure him?

254
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,899
- I'm not saying there's anything wrong.
- I am.

255
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,016
If you really think that, Del...

256
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,650
...you'd be a poor friend to go
back on him when he just got home...

257
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,573
...starting the biggest
and hardest job he's ever had.

258
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,170
You can't let him down, Del,
any more than I can.

259
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,335
- I don't want to.
- You've got to take the marshal's job.

260
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,451
I'll make a deal with Owen.

261
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,977
If he'll take that gun off and stick
to being judge, I'll take the job.

262
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,850
- Not otherwise, Doc.
- That's fine, Del. Fine.

263
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,773
You do swear that you will uphold and
defend the U.S. Constitution...

264
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,569
...that you will faithfully discharge
your duties as federal marshal...

265
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,938
...and that you will at all times serve
and enforce the law, so help you God?

266
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,818
So help me God.

267
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,138
Well, that's that.
Congratulations, marshal.

268
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,416
Thanks, judge.

269
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,099
Yes, Del.
That deal goes all the way.

270
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,098
I'll count on that, Owen.

271
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,813
Del.

272
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,217
- I'm mighty happy about this.
- Thanks.

273
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,769
- So am I.
- Thank you, Caroline.

274
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,018
- Captain.
- Make it marshal.

275
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,694
Yes, sir. Marshal, we're
kind of a committee.

276
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,499
We want you to come over
and see Corporal Dickson.

277
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,969
- What's he up to?
- He's down flat on his back.

278
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,449
Over at camp, in his shack.

279
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,451
There's been some trouble.

280
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,728
Maybe you'd better
come along too, Owen.

281
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,853
Why, you don't need me, marshal.
Sounds more like you need Doc.

282
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,133
Howdy, son.

283
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,895
Hi, Doc. Howdy, captain.

284
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,974
What happened, Dickson?

285
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:50,737
I went to work my claim, soon as
I got my discharge yesterday.

286
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,937
You know my claim.
Told you about it many a time.

287
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,015
Four men I'd never seen
before in my life...

288
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,536
...told me to get off
of Ed Carter's property.

289
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,658
They grabbed me, held me up
against a rock and pistol-whipped me.

290
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,217
They pistol-whipped him until
he couldn't stand. Booted him.

291
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,779
He has some broken ribs.

292
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,216
- He laid up there till way last night.
- Couldn't talk at first.

293
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,214
We all got warned. Any man that
trespasses on Ed Carter's property...

294
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,133
...will be in trouble, so they said.

295
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:28,818
Charlie Trumbull says the Great Star
Mining Company owns our claims.

296
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,977
Too many guns.
Get them out of sight.

297
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,449
We're out of the Army,
all done taking orders.

298
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,019
I'm talking to civilians.

299
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,533
Any man that thinks he can settle his
business with a gun, I'll arrest.

300
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,537
I don't want to do
that to any of you.

301
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,170
So we should let the gang, that stayed
home while we fought, rob us...

302
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,252
...and not even put up a fight?
- Save that for the judge.

303
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,729
The judge?
You mean, the colonel?

304
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,652
That's right, Johnny.

305
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,088
Doc, do you think you could have
him in shape to be in court in an hour?

306
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,216
I'll be there, captain.

307
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,769
You'll be flat on your
back if you are.

308
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,528
All right, bring him in on a cot.

309
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,975
You men be there too.

310
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:15,133
And round up any other fellows that
have a complaint, or think they have.

311
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,610
But remember, no guns.

312
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,414
You argue that the Great Star
Mining Company...

313
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,253
...is illegally in possession
of your property.

314
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,215
Now that's on the basis
of miners' law...

315
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,816
...a local agreement among miners
who prospected here before the war.

316
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,971
Who better to make
miners' laws...

317
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,529
...than the men that found the gold?
That's us.

318
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,691
- That's right.
- Yeah.

319
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,768
We've heard your testimony,
corporal.

320
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,575
- Are there any other witnesses?
- Yes, sir. Me.

321
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,968
All right, Johnny.

322
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,052
My brother Jericho and me
had a claim before the war...

323
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,098
...that we found and staked out
according to miners' law.

324
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,889
Right spang in the middle of what
Ed Carter claims is his now.

325
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,330
- Well, I mean to dig that claim.
- Good boy.

326
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,060
A man's got a right
to keep what he found.

327
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,737
We've heard one side of the case.
Now let's hear the other.

328
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:13,610
- Mr. Carter.
- Why, yes, Owen. I mean, Your Honour.

329
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,499
Colorado is now a federal territory.

330
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,696
Someday, and someday soon...

331
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:23,138
...Colorado is going to add another
bright star to that glorious flag.

332
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,972
Let's get to the point.

333
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:29,056
All right, judge.
I'll get to the point.

334
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,410
Miners' law went out
when federal law came in.

335
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,617
The U.S. government says
a man who doesn't work his claim...

336
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:41,058
...in any three-year period
loses all rights to that claim.

337
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,178
The judge knows where we've been
the last three years.

338
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,739
I know where you've been.

339
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,334
You can't live on
the war the rest of your lives.

340
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,537
We don't want to. We want what
belonged to us before the war.

341
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:57,058
No man here can say I haven't acted
in strict accordance with federal law.

342
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,176
Law. Law! That's all we hear.

343
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,729
It's all your law,
all for you and none for us.

344
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,609
You know as well as we do, the only
gold here is on Yellow Mountain.

345
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,931
- Why should he have all of it?
- Yeah, that's right.

346
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:15,377
- I'd like to get something off my chest.
- All right, go ahead.

347
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:22,611
I can't argue law, and I won't try to.
But fact is fact.

348
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,734
These men came to Colorado to pan
a fortune, the same as Mr. Carter.

349
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,097
They had property when they left.
Now they're told they lost...

350
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,774
...what they had while
fighting for their country.

351
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,896
They can't work
without their claims.

352
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,939
I'll hire every man honourably
discharged from the regiment.

353
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,250
Hooray! Hire us to work
our own claim.

354
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,810
I'll pay top wages, $60 a month,
cash on the barrelhead.

355
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,652
A man can't live on that.

356
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,333
You come work for me, Ed.

357
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,812
I'll pay you a $65 a month and throw in
a pair of shoes every other Christmas.

358
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,497
Let's have order.

359
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,736
I'm in a peculiar position.
My sympathy and personal feelings...

360
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,892
...are the same as the marshal's.

361
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,176
I know what you men
are up against.

362
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:18,294
But my personal feelings can't enter
into my decision as a federal judge.

363
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,737
Now, if I ruled in your favour, my...

364
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,495
Well, my decision would be reversed
by a court of appeals.

365
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,369
Now, if there's injustice in the law,
that's a matter for Congress...

366
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,337
...not for this court.

367
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,131
In accordance with the law...

368
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,895
...the lands here in dispute, whose
claimants did no work on them...

369
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:45,178
...within the three years immediately
preceding the date of this action...

370
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,491
...are public lands
and subject to preemption.

371
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,771
Therefore, I am
compelled to rule...

372
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,250
...that the defendant, the
Great Star Mining Company...

373
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:58,379
...is legally the owner
of the lands preempted.

374
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:05,610
Anyone found trespassing on Great
Star Mining Company's property...

375
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:10,092
...after this date does so in defiance
of the law and at his own risk.

376
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,858
Court is adjourned.

377
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,570
That was quite a session
you let me in for.

378
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,130
I'd hoped it would
turn out differently.

379
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,577
I wish it could have.

380
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:41,297
Forget about that for now.
There's something more important.

381
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,328
What is it?

382
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,129
Brace yourself.
I'm gonna kick you in the teeth.

383
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,770
You won't like it right at first.
I don't like doing it.

384
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,855
But we've always been on the level,
and I'd like to stay that way.

385
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,292
Caroline and I have decided
to get married a week from today.

386
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:15,698
I wanted you to know about it before
Caroline gets here in a few minutes.

387
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,293
I won't pull the old line about:

388
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,370
"The best man wins."

389
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,253
Call it the lucky man.

390
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,168
No, Owen.

391
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:33,455
Isn't Caroline the only one
with the right to say no or yes?

392
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,575
All right. We've always been
on the level with each other.

393
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,529
There's something wrong
with you, Owen.

394
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:48,256
I don't know what it is exactly.
Maybe you don't know either.

395
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,775
But I think you ought
to go away for a while.

396
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,410
Take a rest. Get hold of yourself.

397
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,413
Go away?

398
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:04,216
- Take a rest?
- Until you're like your old self again.

399
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:09,139
You probably think I say this
because I'm in love with Caroline too.

400
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,098
I am. But believe me,
six months from now...

401
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,253
...l'll be best man at the wedding
and give the bride away if you want.

402
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,092
Just not now.

403
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,129
You know, I don't have to take
this kind of talk, Del, even from you.

404
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,052
Yes, you do, Owen.

405
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,098
I'll ask you what
the Rebel major asked you.

406
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,890
Why did you have to kill his men?
Why did you have to kill him?

407
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,416
You can't answer that, can you?

408
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,692
Maybe you don't dare answer it,
even to yourself.

409
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,012
You're sick inside, Owen.
You're too sick to marry.

410
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,292
I'm not sick.

411
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:50,335
Now, you get that very clear
in your mind. I'm not sick.

412
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,616
I'm not leaving,
now or any other time.

413
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,216
I'm marrying Caroline a week
from today. Don't try to stop it.

414
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,213
You can't marry her the way you are.
You can't do that.

415
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,291
Get out of here. Get out!

416
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,133
Stop it, Owen.
You're acting like a crazy man.

417
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,299
Del.

418
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,889
Left the wedding kind of early,
didn't you?

419
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:17,133
- Thought I might be of more use here.
- Never needed a doctor less.

420
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,770
Del, you're not making this
any easier on either one of us.

421
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,329
I know how you feel today.

422
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,616
One way, I can't blame you.

423
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,970
Doc, this marriage is all wrong.

424
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:33,418
You know as well as I do, Owen isn't fit
to marry Caroline or anyone else.

425
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,979
If anything on earth will get Owen
straightened out, it's this marriage.

426
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,769
He needs her. Her love can cure him,
if nothing else will.

427
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,973
- I wish I could believe that.
- I believe it.

428
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:48,769
Just so you don't go back on him,
walk out on Owen.

429
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,532
I'm not gonna quit my job,
if that's what you mean.

430
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,373
I feel better
hearing you say that, Del.

431
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,780
Runaway! Runaway! Runaway!

432
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,132
I'll be right back, dear.

433
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:37,053
All right, folks, stand back.
Come on, give them room.

434
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,051
Now, take it easy with him.

435
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,736
Tom! Tom Barton!
Come on out of it, now, Tom!

436
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,660
The gold's gone! Cleaned out!

437
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,618
Well, bring him to!
Do something!

438
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,216
Come on, Tom, talk!
What happened to the gold shipment?

439
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,974
Gone. Two men...

440
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,613
...uniforms.

441
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,412
Couldn't see faces.

442
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,536
They had masks.

443
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,773
I shot one.

444
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,819
Two men in uniform. Go on, Tom.

445
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,734
Tom!

446
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,888
He's dead.

447
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,697
You heard him, marshal.
Two men in uniform.

448
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,055
You'd better get a posse together.

449
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,495
I want volunteers.

450
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,694
- Come on, speak up!
- You got me, marshal, for one.

451
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,976
- I will as soon as I get my gun.
- I'm in.

452
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,131
- All right, I'm in.
- Me too.

453
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,492
- I thought we made a deal.
- We did.

454
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,457
Then what's the idea of the gun?

455
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:05,295
I'd look pretty silly going along
without one. Let's go.

456
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,011
Let's have your gun.

457
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,016
Get off that horse, quick.

458
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,413
Turn around.

459
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,778
Now walk.

460
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,417
And while you're walking,
say your prayers.

461
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,897
Dismissed, "colonel"!

462
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,731
What happened?
Where's your horse?

463
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,494
- He threw me and got away.
- I'll pick him up.

464
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,059
Forget it.

465
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,579
- What do we do with him, judge?
- Plenty of trees right handy.

466
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,937
There'll be no lynching.

467
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,455
That's right, marshal.
There'll be no lynching.

468
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:07,535
This man is entitled to a trial.
He'll have it, right here and now.

469
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,692
Hello, Johnny.

470
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,770
Has Jericho been around?

471
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,893
He's not here.
And he's not gonna be here.

472
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,891
I hope you're right.

473
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:11,499
- Want a drink?
- I'm particular who I drink with.

474
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,289
So am I.

475
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:16,452
I don't drink with a man
that just hung a friend of mine.

476
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,338
I didn't hang anybody, Johnny.

477
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:22,539
Oh, Mutton McGuire just put a rope
around his own neck.

478
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,656
That's about what he did.

479
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:30,536
There's no man who got anything but
the worst of it going against the law.

480
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,614
Mutton McGuire was a good soldier.

481
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,532
He was a good man.

482
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,289
Kind of a bad man to imitate.

483
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,133
- How are you, corporal?
- I get along.

484
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:44,180
I figured you'd be
on the other side of the bridge.

485
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,298
Celebrating victory for law, order
and Judge Devereaux.

486
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,451
I've got nothing to celebrate.

487
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,295
Johnny. Come on.

488
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,654
Johnny!

489
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,895
Go on out back.
Somebody's waiting to see you.

490
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,534
- Jericho?
- Yeah.

491
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,976
He's got his nerve,
coming right into town after today.

492
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,689
He brought half a dozen horses in,
looking for men to ride them.

493
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,771
I told him I'd go with him.

494
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,939
Any of you men feel like
joining up with us?

495
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,133
Sixty a month's not much.

496
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,656
Especially for digging gold out of
my own claim that Carter jumped.

497
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,050
But at least it's honest money.

498
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,098
It's better than getting hung,
like Mutton McGuire.

499
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,411
It's better if you're not man
enough to fight for what's yours.

500
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,411
It's not good enough for me.

501
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,577
You've got yourself one man anyhow.

502
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,019
Make that two.

503
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:08,050
Better keep out of this.
You've got a wife and kids.

504
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,097
I got nobody to hold me back.

505
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:13,696
If we can't get our rights by the law,
take them without.

506
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,730
- That all?
- I'll go with you.

507
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,654
I'd like to go, but I can't do it.
Too much to think of at home.

508
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,492
All right, think of it.

509
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,776
- I'm ready too.
- Come on!

510
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,900
- I wish you boys luck.
- You'll sure need it.

511
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:32,689
- You're looking pretty good, kid.
- I'm all right.

512
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:36,652
- How you been?
- Not too bad, considering.

513
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:39,539
You're as thin as a starved cat.

514
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,177
I guess it's from missing
the old Army beans.

515
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:47,972
Here, I figured that maybe you could
use some eating supplies yourself.

516
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:51,769
- Gold! Well, where'd you get it?
- Off our claim.

517
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,249
I dug it out of one
of Big Ed's hired hands.

518
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,456
Same place I got the horses.

519
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:01,300
- Here's your army, Jericho.
- Hi, Jericho.

520
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,610
- You sure you want to do this?
- We're sure.

521
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:07,853
- Might as well get what we can.
- Nothing left for us here.

522
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,013
Hey!

523
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,413
- Get down off of there.
- Jericho, don't make me.

524
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,333
They're grown men with nothing
to lose but their necks.

525
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,730
- You're a kid. You still got a chance.
- But...

526
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,255
There's only us two Howards
left in this world.

527
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:25,049
One of us is gonna live to be
a granddad. Now, come on.

528
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,969
So long, kid. Behave yourself.

529
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:47,896
What did you wish, Caroline?

530
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,618
Just that Del could be here.

531
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:54,008
I asked him to come,
but he said he was too busy.

532
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:57,935
It just doesn't seem right,
not being here for my birthday.

533
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,294
Oh, well...

534
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,734
Trouble is, you could
only marry one of us.

535
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:13,257
If I didn't know how you really felt
about Del, I'd think you were jealous.

536
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,853
Eat your cake.

537
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:16,814
I'll go.

538
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:26,733
Howdy, ma'am.
We'd like to see the judge.

539
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,492
He's just having his dinner.

540
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:31,049
That's all right, Caroline.
Come on in.

541
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,775
- Well, what is it?
- We got fired today.

542
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:40,137
Ed Carter's gun guards
run us off the property.

543
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:41,972
Why were you fired?

544
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,418
There's been too many holdups...

545
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,094
...and we've been too friendly
to Jericho Howard.

546
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,330
That's what Ed Carter says.

547
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:55,057
Well, I'm afraid it's up to him
to say who works for him.

548
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:58,769
Sure. But, judge, we're abiding
by the law you laid down.

549
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,818
Even though we're digging
our own gold for Ed Carter...

550
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,459
...we do it for our families.

551
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,690
We've done nothing to get fired for.

552
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,738
Except they used to be
my brother's friends. Used to be!

553
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,652
Calm down, Johnny.

554
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:13,573
You men can't blame Mr. Carter
for taking precautions.

555
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:17,653
I don't blame him for anything.
I blame you.

556
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:21,130
Jericho was all right till you
broke him. Why'd you break him?

557
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,178
Just because you won't let
any man stand up to you.

558
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:27,059
He's running the hills
because you drove him to it.

559
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,939
Him and the others.
Good men that fought hard for you.

560
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,177
But you treated them like dirt.

561
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:36,811
Any man's dirt to you, you're so crazy
with power. Just plain crazy!

562
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,210
That's enough! Get out.

563
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:43,575
Maybe you don't believe it, judge,
but there's two kinds of justice:

564
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:46,254
Yours and other people's.
Just don't forget that!

565
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,648
Get out!

566
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,453
Owen, I've never seen you like this.

567
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:07,096
The men didn't mean anything.

568
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:11,697
Johnny Howard's just a boy so worried
about his brother he doesn't know...

569
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:32,737
I wouldn't worry too much about him.
He's just on edge.

570
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:36,969
- Any man that...
- I think you'd better go, Doc.

571
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,136
Why can't you leave me alone?

572
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:43,853
That's five.

573
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,133
Your five...

574
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,059
...and five more.

575
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,179
I'll...

576
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:54,854
...fold.

577
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,098
I'll raise five more.

578
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:08,289
That's right, just sit still.

579
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,980
Which one of you knows
how to open that safe?

580
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:41,172
I'll give you one minute
to make up your mind.

581
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,850
You got a half a minute left.

582
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,288
Easy.

583
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,178
Nice and easy.

584
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,051
All right, that's plenty.

585
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,860
Tell Mr. Carter
I'm leaving him two sacks...

586
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:08,330
...to pay his expenses
for digging up our gold.

587
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:15,211
Sit down and finish your game before
you start to raise any commotion.

588
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:57,090
They ride into town, they ride out
again with $90,000 of my money.

589
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,535
What's done about it?
Absolutely nothing!

590
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,373
The marshal and the posse go out,
and they come back.

591
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:04,258
No prisoners, nothing but excuses.

592
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:06,888
They're veterans.
They can get away with anything.

593
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:10,257
Get a few things straight. They
wouldn't be running the hills...

594
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,650
...if they were given a fair break
when they came home.

595
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,970
What side of this thing
are you on anyhow?

596
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,888
Your side. That's my job.

597
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:21,257
But if you can name one man
in this town who helped those men...

598
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,650
...get a decent start,
I'll eat your hat.

599
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,857
- Why, I hired them. l...
- Sure, sure, you hired them.

600
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:28,817
At pay they couldn't live on.

601
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:32,973
You fired them when you found out
they were friends of Jericho Howard.

602
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:34,898
No wonder some of them joined him.

603
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,494
Fine state of affairs,
when the marshal stands...

604
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:40,254
...in front of the judge
and defends outlaws.

605
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,058
I'm not defending any outlaws...

606
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:45,690
...but this town had better wake up,
or there'll be more outlaws.

607
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:48,932
He's right in a way. A lot of men
are pretty hard up and mad.

608
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,534
We ought to be able to do
something for them.

609
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,772
We will, after we get some
law and order back in this country.

610
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:56,259
I hold you responsible.

611
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,729
We're not getting what
we counted on from you.

612
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,733
- We want action!
- That's what you'll get.

613
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,016
The men who robbed you
and killed Rawson...

614
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:07,217
...will be caught and hanged
within the next 48 hours.

615
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:20,211
- Let's get going.
- Where do we start?

616
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:24,409
Over in Glory Hill, where we should've
started in the first place.

617
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:51,217
On who?

618
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,494
When did you boys get back in town?

619
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:25,129
Who said we ever left?

620
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:32,768
I still bet Jericho saw us looking for
him. Just too ornery to let us know.

621
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,693
Two days is as long as I'll look
for any man, even him.

622
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:38,328
If he don't want us,
then let's forget about it...

623
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,492
...and try something else.
- Try what?

624
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:50,659
- You hear what happened last night?
- Yeah, we slept out and it rained.

625
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,291
Where you been
the last couple of days?

626
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:12,019
We've just been travelling around.
That's all, marshal. Looking for...

627
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:13,454
Not looking for anything.

628
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,497
That's right, we were just looking.

629
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,059
- Who does this belong to?
- Me.

630
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:30,780
- Where'd you get it?
- Why, Ed Carter gave it to me.

631
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,852
- Didn't you know he's my friend?
- That's kid talk, Johnny.

632
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,931
Somebody emptied
his safe last night...

633
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:39,092
...and got away with $90,000
worth of that stuff.

634
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,257
What do you know about it?

635
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:47,698
Not a thing, except it's the best news
since General Lee called off the war.

636
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,618
Did you ever see this before?

637
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:57,936
- This isn't your gun, is it?
- Maybe.

638
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,499
Where'd you see it before?

639
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:02,333
You tell me when,
and I'll tell you where.

640
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:06,648
A man was killed
in that holdup last night.

641
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,139
That's his hard luck.

642
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:11,770
No, it's yours. If you shot him.

643
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:13,658
I don't think you did.

644
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:16,011
I don't care what you think!

645
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:22,816
All right, I'm gonna lock you up.
All of you.

646
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:26,416
Until one of you gets sense enough
to talk straight. Come on!

647
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:40,335
The gun, the sack of gold dust...

648
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,936
...and where you were when
Ed Carter's office was robbed.

649
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:47,774
Three things against you, Johnny.

650
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:51,653
That might be enough to hang you.

651
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:54,570
Do you understand that?

652
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:59,254
You're not helping Jericho.

653
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:02,814
You don't wanna hang
for something you didn't do.

654
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:06,258
You've got your whole life
ahead of you, Johnny.

655
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,415
Did he tell you anything?

656
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:39,297
- You wouldn't believe him if he did.
- No, I wouldn't.

657
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:44,690
- Not with the evidence we've got.
- I still say Johnny wasn't in on it.

658
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:48,818
- How do you know?
- I know him.

659
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:52,131
He's protecting his brother.
Or trying to anyhow.

660
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:55,569
Well, you have a right to your
personal opinion.

661
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:58,413
- I have to go on facts.
- The law states that a man...

662
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:01,777
...is innocent until proved guilty
beyond any reasonable doubt.

663
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,571
- I know the law.
- All right.

664
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:07,975
Then put off the trial
for a few days.

665
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:11,378
Why should I?

666
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:15,090
I'll give you reason enough.

667
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:17,854
I want time to find Jericho Howard
and bring him in.

668
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:20,011
Haven't done well
finding him up to now.

669
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:21,932
I made a mistake by having a posse.

670
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,568
Del, I've gone along with you
as far as I can.

671
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:28,335
- lf you were in my place...
- I'd give Johnny a chance to live.

672
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,458
This is one time I intend
to have things my way, Owen.

673
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:34,737
I don't want that kid touched
until I get back.

674
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:38,815
I don't take orders.
Not from you or anyone else!

675
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:40,811
You'll take this one.

676
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:43,653
Don't hang Johnny Howard.

677
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:22,258
- You've been hard to find, Jericho.
- I haven't been lost, marshal.

678
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:25,139
Now that you're here,
how do you figure on getting out?

679
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:28,497
- That's up to you to say.
- You bet it is.

680
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:31,220
Any idea I'm gonna give you
any of the best of it?

681
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:34,736
Depends if you want your kid brother
to hang for a killing you did.

682
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,256
Say that again!

683
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:42,779
Two nights ago Devereaux was getting
ready to try Johnny for the shooting...

684
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:46,819
...of a man named Rawson
in the holdup of Ed Carter's office.

685
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:50,257
- Johnny had no part of that job.
- I know he didn't.

686
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:52,331
There's enough evidence
to hang him.

687
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,252
He had a sack of gold dust.

688
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:57,014
Somebody dropped a gun
outside Ed Carter's office...

689
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:59,569
...with "J. Howard"
carved on the handle.

690
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:03,496
They can't convict the kid
on just that.

691
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:04,854
Maybe not.

692
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:08,296
But what will convict him is the fact
he won't defend himself.

693
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:10,178
Won't say a word.

694
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:13,129
He thinks he's protecting you.

695
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:18,618
Add it all up, Jericho,
and see what you get.

696
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:33,048
That crazy, know-nothing kid.

697
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:34,818
That's what he is, all right.

698
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:37,414
He's gonna swing for it
unless you make a move.

699
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:40,688
- You're asking me to...?
- I'm not asking you.

700
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:42,259
I'm telling you.

701
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,298
You're gonna dance on a rope end
sooner or later anyhow.

702
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,496
Johnny's too young
to die for nothing...

703
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:49,616
...but cockeyed loyalty
to his brother.

704
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:55,538
That's why I say it's up to you.

705
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:57,895
Who pays your bills, Jericho?

706
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:00,410
You or Johnny?

707
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:14,331
You coming with me?

708
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:27,614
Move over to the other place.
I'll see you there.

709
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:29,737
Give him his gun.

710
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:33,250
All right, marshal, you got your man.
What are you waiting for?

711
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:56,057
Johnny!

712
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:01,814
Colonel Devereaux's justice?

713
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:31,370
I just saw Johnny Howard.

714
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:34,418
You had to hang him. You had
another chance to kill a man.

715
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:35,808
You couldn't resist it.

716
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:37,699
I stood by you, Owen.

717
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:39,816
Let you go on being federal judge.

718
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:43,177
Thought I could stand between you
and people like Johnny Howard.

719
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:44,932
Keep you from any more killing.

720
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:46,732
I was wrong.

721
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,697
There's only one way to stop you.

722
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:52,819
That's to take the power of life
and death from you. Finish you.

723
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:56,416
And that's what I'm going to do,
any way I can.

724
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:01,410
You still won't get Caroline.

725
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:56,371
It was on the front door.

726
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:05,768
Aren't you going to say anything?

727
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:09,413
Everyone was talking at the store.

728
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:13,773
Owen, how can you hang five men?

729
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:15,976
Five more?

730
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:17,414
They had their trial.

731
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:20,650
You convicted them
on no more evidence...

732
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:22,776
...than there was
against Johnny Howard.

733
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:24,976
Just because they were with him.

734
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:27,690
Because they were guilty.

735
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:34,690
I think you better come with me,
Caroline.

736
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:38,090
To watch you hang them?

737
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:41,411
To show the town
that my wife believes in me.

738
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:43,975
I have a right to ask that.

739
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:49,411
How can I stand by you in this?

740
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:55,060
First Del, now you.

741
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:58,570
Owen, Del is the best friend
you ever had.

742
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:01,493
He wouldn't turn against you
without such good cause...

743
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:04,413
...that he had to,
any more than I would.

744
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:08,331
I try to understand you.

745
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,058
I can't.

746
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:12,859
I just can't.

747
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:16,180
You believe this
because Del believes it.

748
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:18,410
Because you're in love with Del.

749
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:21,617
- You always were.
- That's not true, Owen.

750
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:26,856
Do you love me?

751
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:31,018
You won't let me anymore.

752
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:19,138
Come on, jump in!

753
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,658
Let's go!

754
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:42,373
It won't do, it just won't.

755
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:44,496
What happened will be
all over Colorado.

756
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:46,810
We've got a war.
That's what it amounts to.

757
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:50,859
Next thing to plain armed rebellion!
Soldiers shooting at civilians.

758
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:52,976
- They're not soldiers.
- They were.

759
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:55,654
They were your own men,
which makes it look worse.

760
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:57,697
Your best friend is running the gang.

761
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:00,010
The man that you insisted on
for marshal.

762
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:02,011
Del Stewart will hang.

763
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:04,330
The same as any of the rest,
when I get him.

764
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,617
If you get him. Owen, we need
somebody else running things...

765
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:10,772
...that's not mixed up in this
personally the way you are...

766
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:15,297
...to get things quieted down, which
I don't believe you can ever do.

767
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:18,692
I'm a federal judge.

768
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:22,489
One man can put me out of office.
That's the territorial governor.

769
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,418
I come over as quick as I could.

770
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:29,772
Good night, Mr. Carter.

771
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:38,298
Good night.

772
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:37,259
Hi, fellows.
I hardly expected to see you around.

773
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:42,253
How about me buying a drink...

774
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,729
...to, kind of, celebrate
your good health?

775
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:46,492
Three.

776
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:50,337
- Funny thing, I lost my thirst.
- Me the same.

777
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,331
Funny thing.

778
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:55,051
I'll...

779
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,730
...have to drink alone, then.

780
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,936
- Seems a shame.
- Yeah, seems a shame...

781
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:03,136
...to say no to a popular man
like you.

782
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,860
You wouldn't believe
what a popular man you are.

783
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:09,456
Anywhere you go,
somebody's sure to tell somebody.

784
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:15,534
What were you doing
at Judge Devereaux's house?

785
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:18,900
He wanted to know
if I knew where Del Stewart is.

786
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:22,257
I told him no, of course.

787
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:26,333
Even if I did know, I wouldn't tell
anything on Del Stewart.

788
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:27,853
You boys know that.

789
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:30,136
You don't want to lie
to the wrong people!

790
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:34,248
In the Army, you were always
very careful not to get yourself hurt.

791
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:37,254
You're too old to change
your habits now.

792
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:40,810
Save your money.
You might need it.

793
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:45,298
What are you shaking about?

794
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:49,980
You can tell Del Stewart something
if you want to.

795
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:51,858
If you see him.

796
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:55,057
His lady friend
is in plenty of trouble.

797
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:59,890
You wouldn't mean Mrs. Devereaux,
would you?

798
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:03,018
I don't know any other lady friend
he ever had.

799
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,811
Things are mighty bad
in that house.

800
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:09,778
The judge locked her up.
No telling what he might do.

801
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:12,613
She asked me to get a message
to Del Stewart.

802
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:14,736
Said she needs help.

803
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:19,657
But if...

804
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:22,096
...I can't find him...

805
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,652
...I can't tell him.

806
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:27,532
Well...

807
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:31,214
...l'll see you boys around
some more.

808
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:57,978
Claims he's got a message for you
from Mrs. Devereaux.

809
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:00,171
When did you see Mrs. Devereaux?

810
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:05,132
- This evening at her house.
- He was there, all right.

811
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,097
She's in trouble with the judge.

812
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:09,091
She grabbed me
just as I was leaving.

813
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:10,898
Told me she wants to see you.

814
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:13,699
She has to see you,
that's what she said.

815
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:15,777
"Find Del Stewart," she said to me.

816
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:18,408
"Tell him if he still cares
at all about me...

817
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:20,810
...he'd better come
and see me tonight."

818
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:35,699
You don't have to believe it.

819
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,850
I've got nothing to lose if you don't.

820
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:42,615
Still dog-robbing for the colonel,
the same as always.

821
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:45,533
He'd sell his mother for two bits,
and give you change.

822
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:49,056
The idea is to draw you
out in the open, no matter how.

823
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:51,609
I don't know which is the lowest...

824
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:53,577
...the judge or this!

825
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:00,816
I'll have to go over there.

826
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:05,532
- You're a fool if you do.
- All right, I'm a fool.

827
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:10,576
Maybe your friends ought
to stop you for your own good.

828
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,975
A few of us will go along,
just in case.

829
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:16,096
One man's enough.

830
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:20,092
Let's go.

831
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:23,375
Remember, I'll be right behind you...

832
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:25,337
...all the way.

833
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:52,054
Come on, come on.
Hurry up.

834
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:13,138
Hold it!

835
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:34,491
Get him locked up.

836
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:45,529
Get out of town before morning
and don't come back.

837
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:28,734
All right, just a moment.

838
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:33,175
Why, Caroline, come in.

839
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:35,690
What is it, Caroline?
Anything wrong?

840
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:38,374
Owen just arrested Del.

841
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:42,419
Doc, he's going to hang him,
murder Del with the law.

842
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:46,573
- Caroline, I can't believe it.
- You'll believe Owen, won't you?

843
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:13,852
Caroline?

844
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,418
Caroline!

845
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:37,212
Caroline!

846
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:29,930
You're the man I want to talk to,
seeing you're the marshal now.

847
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:34,173
I'm the marshal, all right,
but I got no business for you, Doc.

848
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:36,730
There's nobody sick around here.

849
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:39,368
Not yet anyhow.

850
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:43,050
- I want to see Del Stewart.
- He's not seeing visitors.

851
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:45,939
- Not tonight.
- I'm here on official business.

852
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:48,170
The law requires
a medical examination...

853
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:50,137
...for a man
before he can be hanged.

854
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:53,297
That's the first I heard about it.

855
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:57,134
You're kind of new at this job.

856
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:00,374
If you want to go
and wake my nephew, the judge...

857
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:04,419
...and ask him, it's your privilege,
of course.

858
01:22:12,820 --> 01:22:14,538
Well...

859
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:17,452
...all right.

860
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:19,538
Come on.

861
01:22:29,140 --> 01:22:31,495
- Hi, Doc.
- Hi, Del.

862
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:35,251
- Well, let me in.
- You can see him from out here.

863
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:38,253
How can I examine a man
through this?

864
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:51,218
- Get it over with.
- Don't rush me.

865
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:06,134
Would you hand me
my stethoscope, please, Del?

866
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:18,451
Lock him up.

867
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:35,612
Line up!

868
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:38,372
Backs to me.

869
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:39,939
Keep them up.

870
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:42,731
Get their guns.

871
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:44,938
Keep them up.

872
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:53,451
All right, in there.

873
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:55,818
Move!

874
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:12,016
- You're a fool to get mixed up in this.
- We'll talk about that later.

875
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:14,410
Caroline. You had no right
to bring her here.

876
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:16,491
- She brought me.
- I couldn't let Owen...

877
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:19,572
Don't make me talk about it.
Doc will drive you to Denver.

878
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:21,970
See the governor.
Tell him Owen is sick.

879
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,698
Too sick to go on being judge.

880
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:35,815
Now you'll have to hurry.

881
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:02,893
There.

882
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:05,974
If I were you I'd lie still, Del.

883
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:12,737
He'll sleep awhile. He'll be
in fair shape when he wakes.

884
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:15,698
- Doc, what are we going to do?
- You stop worrying.

885
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:20,376
With what I've got to show the
governor, he'll straighten things out.

886
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:24,054
All right, Jericho,
I'm ready to get going.

887
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:27,053
You ain't going to Denver, Doc.
Nobody is.

888
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:29,370
They've got the bridge blocked.

889
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:01,380
Judge, we found
Mrs. Devereaux's buggy.

890
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:03,929
- No sign of them?
- Can't get nobody to talk.

891
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:06,409
But they're around here sure.

892
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:12,578
Former marshal Del Stewart
escaped from jail last night.

893
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:15,538
We know he's hiding here.
Some of you know where he is.

894
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:19,136
The sooner you turn him over to us,
the better it'll be for you.

895
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:24,291
Come on, speak up.
Where is he?

896
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:33,498
This is a warning.

897
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:36,652
Unless Del Stewart is given up
before 7:00 tonight...

898
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:40,096
...all of you will have to accept
full responsibility.

899
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:42,735
You have until 7:00.

900
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:22,893
What time is it, Doc?

901
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:30,735
It's almost 6.

902
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:37,379
Come on, let's dig up some food.

903
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:55,776
Judge, shouldn't you get
something to eat?

904
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:59,933
And get a little rest? There's still
plenty of time before 7:00.

905
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:23,849
Del, if I go back to Owen...

906
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:27,057
...even now,
maybe he'd listen to me.

907
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:32,292
- You're not going back to him.
- I'm still his wife.

908
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:38,489
You're never going back to him.

909
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:48,018
Del!

910
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:56,018
Owen.

911
01:29:56,540 --> 01:29:58,451
Owen!

912
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:09,372
Are you satisfied now?
Have you done enough damage?

913
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:11,576
Burn half the town.
I own property there.

914
01:31:11,740 --> 01:31:14,049
Owned it, and so did
a lot of other people.

915
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:16,688
It doesn't matter to you!
Why didn't you stop him?

916
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:18,896
- Tell me anyhow.
- You told us...

917
01:31:19,060 --> 01:31:21,620
...to take orders from the judge.
I tried to argue.

918
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:23,691
Didn't ask anybody what they think.

919
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:27,819
Started the worst fire this town
ever had. Started it deliberately.

920
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:32,098
You wanted a gang of outlaws
rounded up, well, there they are.

921
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:35,252
I suggest you leave law enforcement
to officers of the law.

922
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:37,172
Law? You're not enforcing law.

923
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:40,457
You're out to get the man
who stole your wife.

924
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:44,339
- My wife was kidnapped.
- Call it that if you want to.

925
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:46,616
Your wife ran off
with your best friend.

926
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:51,331
And you're out of your head about it.
Crazy to get even. Crazy!

927
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:20,698
Caroline!

928
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:29,098
Caroline!

929
01:32:41,380 --> 01:32:43,416
Drop your gun, Owen.

930
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:45,571
There's been enough killing.

931
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:47,651
If you won't finish him, I will!

932
01:32:48,620 --> 01:32:50,451
Owen!

933
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:22,731
- Bye, marshal.
- Have a good trip, Del.

934
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:24,652
- Thanks.
- You get us some action.

935
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:26,970
We'll stay in Washington
until we do, York.

936
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:30,689
Tell them all we want is our rights,
marshal. We'll take it from there.

937
01:33:30,860 --> 01:33:33,249
- Goodbye, Doc.
- Goodbye, boy.

938
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:37,289
- Good luck, Del.
- Thanks, Caroline.

939
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:38,893
All aboard!

940
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:41,896
I'll be back soon.

941
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:47,691
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!
