1
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:55,588
I NEVER SAW THIS LAND
WHEN IT WAS GREEN.

2
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:01,594
MY FATHER DID.

3
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:04,997
HE WORKED IT BEFORE
THE DROUGHT CAME.

4
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:08,434
HE USED TO TALK ABOUT
IT ALL THE TIME.

5
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:11,504
HE USED TO TALK ABOUT THE
WHEAT THEY GREW AND THE

6
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:14,840
PRIDE THEY FELT.

7
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,843
HE ALWAYS BELIEVED
IN THE LAND.

8
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,947
EVEN AS THE FIGHTS OVER
WATER FIRST DIVIDED STATES,

9
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:24,550
THEN TOWNS, AND THEN
NEIGHBORS, MOST PEOPLE WHO
COULD, LEFT.

10
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:28,654
BUT HE HAD HIS
REASONS FOR STAYING.

11
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:35,928
HE WAS CONVINCED THE
LAND WOULD COME BACK.

12
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,731
IT JUST NEEDED WATER.

13
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:41,267
AND HE WAS RIGHT.

14
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,954
AHH!

15
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:04,857
OH!

16
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,665
UHH, UHH...

17
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,302
NO NO
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!

18
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,912
<i>YOU KILLED HIM!</i>

19
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,751
GET AWAY FROM HIM!

20
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,753
YOU KILLED HIM!

21
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,921
I GOTTA GO TO THE BATHROOM.

22
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,491
YOU DON'T TURN FORWARD,
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CUT YOU
DOWN.

23
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,993
I GOTTA PISS!

24
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,629
IF I DON'T TAKE IT OUT AND
GO I'M GONNA GO IN MY PANTS!

25
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,099
DO NOT MOVE YOUR ARMS!

26
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,037
NOW YOU TELL ME
WHERE YOU'RE FROM!

27
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,341
THEY SAID THERE'S
WATER HERE.

28
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,043
WHO SAID?

29
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:58,811
WHICH DIRECTION
YOU COME FROM?

30
00:02:58,812 --> 00:02:58,944
AT THE BLACKTOP, WE WENT
RIGHT, SO TWO DAYS TO THE

31
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,350

32
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:04,550
GRAY BELL?

33
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,219
NO WAY!

34
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,654
CADDY.

35
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,523
TURN AROUND SLOW.

36
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,792
BEAUTIFUL, THIS WAY.

37
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,226
HELL...

38
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:17,396
YOU AIN'T GONNA
SHOOT ME IN THE BACK.

39
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,202
WHAT'S LEFT IN CADDY?

40
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,437
OH GOD DAMN IT
I'M PEEING MYSELF!

41
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:28,641
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO
STINK NOW UNTIL I CAN...

42
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,486
KILL HIM?

43
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,089
YOU HIT ERNEST?

44
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,762
STAY THERE!

45
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:50,596
SHOVEL?

46
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,503
I'LL GET IT.

47
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:10,750
YOU SHOULD'VE LET
ME HELP YOU ERNEST.

48
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,519
I'M NOT SCARED.

49
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,221
HOW DO YOU SPELL YOUR NAME?

50
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:16,722
WHAT?

51
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:17,456

52
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,758
HOW DO YOU SPELL IT?

53
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,024
J-E-R-O-M-E.

54

56
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:27,133
MAYBE YOU'RE
MORE OF A JERRY.

57
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,134
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

58
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,468
NO?

59
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,704
THEN WHY YOU CALL ME ERNEST?

60
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,008
'CAUSE THAT'S YOUR NAME.

61
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:43,048

YOU STUCK WITH DAD.

62
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:08,908
CAN'T CALL IT
A WELL NO MORE.

63
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,311
SHOULD WE GO BACK?

64
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,948
SHE'LL MAKE IT.

65

AND LET ME DO THE TALKING.

81
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,473
THESE MEN ARE ANIMALS.

82
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,575
YOU'VE GOT NO
BUSINESS WITH THEM.

83
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,612
WE'LL DELIVER THE RATIONS
AND BOOZE AND GET THE HELL
OUT OF THERE.

84
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,751
DID MY NICOTINE
PATCHES COME IN?

85
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:26,585
NOT YET.

86
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:29,255
MAYBE NEXT TIME.

87
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,523
OH.

88
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:32,558
THAT'S NICE.

89
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,226
YEAH, ALRIGHT.

90
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,594
NICE AND CRISP.

91
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,096
VERY WELL MADE.

92
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,733
THOUGHT YOU WENT
STRAIGHTEDGE.

93
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,203
YOU FALL OFF THE WAGON?

94
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:45,170

95
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,538

THEN WHAT WOULD YOU EAT?

100
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:56,882
LIKE YOU SAID, EVALUATING
THE FOOD OR MAGAZINES, YOU

101
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:05,624
MUST'VE DONE SOMETHING
SHADY TO GET THIS DETAIL.

102
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,192
I GOT A DONKEY.

YOU THINK THAT'S
GONNA CUT IT?

104

HEY CALEB, I WAS HOPING I COULD
TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS WATER.

105
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:17,436
IF IT'S NOT HEADING TOWARDS
US, WHERE'S IT GOING?

106
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,207
WE JUST GOT TO REROUTE

109
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,214
YOU SOUND LIKE
YOU'RE PROUD OF IT.

110
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,383
I'M PROUD OF HARD WORK.

111
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,985
A JOB'S A JOB, ERNEST.

112
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,254
AND YOU BETTER REMEMBER THAT
IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOURS

114
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,758
MY LAND'S FERTILE,
IT'S JUST DRY.

115
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:41,961
HOO BOY!

116
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,729
WE KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU HATE BEING DRY.

117
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,999
YOU JUST WORRY ABOUT GETTING
THOSE SUPPLIES UP HERE.

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,468
LET US WORRY ABOUT
WHERE THE WATER GOES.

119
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:01,280
HO!

120
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,755
OH, GEEZ.

121
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,293
WOAH, WOAH, WOAH.

122
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,328
SHH.

123
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:44,857
I'M SORRY.

124
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,091
NO, IT'S OKAY.

125
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:49,862
THAT SHOULD NEVER
BE A SHAME TO YOU.

126
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,568
I COULD'VE DONE IT.

127
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,140
I KNOW YOU COULD.

128
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,237
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

129
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:32,938
HAMBURGER, FRENCH
FRIES AND A COKE.

130
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:38,010
THESE WERE HARD TO GET.

131
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,345
KEEP THEM CLOSED!

132
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:49,321
WHAT'VE YOU GOT FOR DAD?

133
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:53,125
JEROME GOT THE LAST
BURGER AND FRIES.

134

YOU COULD LISTEN TO
SOMETHING ELSE TONIGHT.

00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:59,083
I NEVER WORRY ABOUT YOU.

322
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:02,353
I WORRY ABOUT YOUR SISTER.

323
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:05,423
I WORRY ABOUT MARY'S
LIFE, NOT YOURS.

324
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:05,990
ON A PRAYER, IF ANY DEER OR
ELK LOOKING FOR WATER

325
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,462
TONIGHT, THEY'LL STRAY
THROUGH HERE, SNIP OUT THE

326
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,463
PUMP, FALL THROUGH
THE PLASTIC, AND BAM.

327
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:18,369
CATCH 'EM IN THIS TRAP!

328
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,039
THINK HOW GOOD
THAT'LL TASTE, RIGHT?

329
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,274
BRING ME SOME SCRAPS.

330
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:32,684
DID I TELL YOU I THINK
I MET A GIRL YOU'D LIKE?

331
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,385
LAST TIME I
CROSSED THE BORDER?

332
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,019
YEAH?

333
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,020
YEAH.

334
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,956
SHE MIGHT BE A BIT
OLDER THAN YOU.

335
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:40,525
THAT A PROBLEM?

336
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:41,459
I TOLD THIS ONE ABOUT YOU.

337
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,062
HER EYES WENT ALL...

338
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:46,064
MMM.

339
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:47,065
YEAH.

340
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,035
I GET HUNCHES
ON THESE THINGS.

341
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,303
I DON'T THINK I
HAVE TIME FOR WOMEN.

342
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:58,509
YOU'RE TOO BUSY FOR WOMEN?

343
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,045
YOU TOO BUSY FOR FRIENDS?

344
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,413
I DON'T SEE
MUCH OF THEM AROUND.

345
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:03,915
THERE'S PLENTY
OF KIDS OUT HERE.

346
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,217
WHAT ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS?

347
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,619
I HAD 'EM.

348
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,820
I HAD 'EM.

349
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:11,923
LONG AS I DON'T GET ON YOUR
NERVES, I PREFER TO HANG OUT

350
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,261
WITH YOU.

351
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:18,363
SHIT!

352
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:19,864
TRAP WORKS.

353
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,233
LITTLE HELP?

354
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:22,500
THANKS.

355
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:25,603
WOAH!

356
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,506
SHOW ME!

357
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:29,340
KEEP YOUR HANDS UP.

358
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,342
OOH!

359
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:31,943
GOOD!

360
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:32,410
GOOD!

361
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,946
GOOD, THAT...

362
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:36,781
RAGH!

363
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,218
YEAH, THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

364
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:42,420
YOU DON'T GOTTA MARRY HER.

365
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,888
YOU DON'T WANT TO WAIT AROUND
THINKING SOMETHING'S GONNA COME.

366
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,427
WAITING'S A FUCKING DISESE.

367
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,930
THINK SOMETHING,
FEEL SOMETHING?

368
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,532
YOU SHOULD DO SOMETHING!

369
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:55,566
ALRIGHT?

370
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:08,012
WHAT'S SHE LIKE?

371
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:09,714
WELL, SHE'S GOT EARS THAT
POKE THROUGH HER HAIR.

380
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:00,832
I COULD WALK
RIGHT OUT OF HERE.

381
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:03,968
YOU CAN'T KEEP ME.

382

NO I CAN'T.

383
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:10,041

YOU'RE MAKING ME A LIAR!

384
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:13,511

MAYBE I WANT A SECRET.

386
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:17,615
WHATEVER YOU'RE ANGRY ABOUT,
YOU'RE ANGRY AT YOURSELF.

387
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,887
MAYBE YOU'RE
RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

388
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,322
I KNOW I'M RIGHT.

389
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:25,390
FLEM SAYS FAILURES
GIVE THE MOST ADVICE.

390
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:28,860
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

391
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,964
I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE.

392
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:34,999
WELL EVEN IF THAT'S TRUE,
IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE HOW

393
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,501
THINGS ARE IN THIS HOUSE.

394
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:38,503
IF YOU'RE HERE, YOU
GOTTA STAY HERE.

395
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:40,238
WHY PUNISH ME
FOR BEING HAPPY?

396
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,807
IT'S NOT PUNISHMENT.,
IT'S PROTECTION.

397
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:44,909
BUT IT MAKES ME HATE YOU!

398
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,378
DO YOU FEEL ANYTHING
WHEN I SAY THAT?

399
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,013
I HATE YOU!

400
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,748
I LOVE HIM!

401
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,438
WHAT'S WRONG?

402
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:14,605
WHAT HAPPENED?

403
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,240
WHAT HAPPENED?

404
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,809
I NEED MONEY!

405
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,112
I'M LEAVING!

406
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,783
GET AWAY FROM ME!

407
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:28,419
GIVE IT BACK TO HIM.

408
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,454
SHE DIDN'T ASK FOR IT.

409
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:30,455
GIVE IT BACK TO HIM!

410
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:32,123
SHE, SHE DIDN'T...

411
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:33,558
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE!

412
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:35,093
SHH.

413
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,360
I HATE YOU!

414
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,129
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

415
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,698
I NEED HIM!

416
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,805
LOOK AT OUR LIVES!

417
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,774
YOU FAILED US!

418
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:53,277
YOU FAILED YOUR FAMILY!

419
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,352
OH NO.

420
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,988
THE MACHINE!

421
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,790
IT'S GONE!

422
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,215
WHAT DID MY BOY DO NOW?

423
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:37,748
NOTHING, SAM.

424
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,253
I JUST WANTED TO FINISH A
CONVERSATION HE AND I HAD
STARTED.

425
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:46,057
YOU HAVE ANY LUCK
WITH THAT PIPELINE?

426
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:49,727
NAH.

427
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,529
DON'T HAVE MUCH
TO OFFER HIM.

428
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,233
I'M TRYING TO
KEEP MY DISTANCE.

429
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,704
WELL, THAT'S FALLOW ANYWAY.

430
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:01,239
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
LEFT OF IT.

431
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,007
ALL'S IS.

432
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:05,109
I GUESS I MEAN TO
SAY IT'S INFERTILE.

433
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,679
EVEN IF THE WATER COMES, I'D
STILL BE STUCK RUNNING THESE

434
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,280
BIRD RACES AND AUCTIONS
AND WHAT HAVE YOU.

435
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:13,017
DON'T THINK FLEMMING
KNOWS IT'S DEAD.

436
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:19,423
YOU THINK HE'D WORK IT?

437
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,692
DON'T KNOW.

438
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:24,862
HE'S OBSESSED WITH THE LAND
WE'VE LOST, NOT WITH THE

439
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:28,032
LAND WE HAVE LEFT.

440
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:30,568
YOU KNOW HOW FLEMMING
SPENDS HIS DAYS?

441
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:33,204
HE'S GOT HIS
SELF WORK PLACES.

442
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:35,072
HE WENT UP TO THE
MOUNTAIN THIS MORNING.

443
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,241
REALLY?

444
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,877
SAYS HE'S ON A SUPPLY
DETAIL FOR THE WATER WORKS.

445
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,679
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT PAYS.

446
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,149
HE COME BACK ALREADY?

447
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:48,986
HE TOOK MY TRUCK.

448
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,225
<i>CHECK OVER THE RIDGE!</i>

449
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:28,759
<i>I SEE HIM, HE'S
RIGHT BELOW YOU!</i>

450
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,295
<i>WHERE?</i>

451
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:42,807
<i>I SEE YOU YOU SON OF A BITCH!</i>

452
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:47,978
AGH!

453
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:50,681
THAT'S THAT.

454
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,651
<i>YOU FIND THOSE SUPPLIES!</i>

455
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:54,852
<i>WAKEY WAKEY!</i>

456
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,654
<i>WHERE'S THAT MACHINE OF HIS?</i>

457
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:58,155
FUCKING WAKE UP!

458
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,557
GET UP!

459
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:01,058
DO YOU THINK WE'RE STUPID?

460
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,827
I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT WHAT
THOSE SUPPLIES ARE WORTH ON

461
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:06,197
THE BLACK MARKET, AND THEN
YOU HAD THAT MACHINE TAKE
EVERYTHING!

462
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,298
AND A DAY'S WORK GONE.

463
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:08,966
GONE, GOD DAMN IT!

464
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,468
WHERE ARE THOSE SUPPLIES?

465
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:11,869
I DIDN'T TAKE ANYTHING.

466
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,637
YOU KNOW IT'S A FEDERAL, A
GOD DAMNED FEDERAL CRIME!

467
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:14,538
FUCK YOU!

468
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,475
CALEB, I NEVER
DONE YOU WRONG.

469
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:18,142
DONE ME WRONG?

470
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,256
ARGH!

471
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:33,257
RAAGH!

472
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:35,760
DON'T.

473
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:50,474
YOU'RE A DEAD MAN, HOLM!

474
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,913
YOU WON'T LIVE OUT THE WEEK!

475
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,651
UP, UP.

476
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,233
WHAT...

477
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:51,569
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR LIP?

478
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,004
DON'T LOOK LIKE AN ACCIDENT.

479
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:54,171
YOU DRINKING TOO MUCH AGAIN?

480
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:00,110
YOU'RE GONNA SET
THIS STORY STRAIGHT.

481
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:01,979
WHAT, WITH CALEB?

482
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,781
NO, THOSE WATERMEN
PAID ME TO TAKE IT.

483
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:05,316
THERE'S INSURANCE
MONEY IN IT.

484
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,083
I'M PROMISING YOU.

485
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,084
LOOK, I...

486
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:08,986
I KNOW YOU'RE MAD, BUT...

487
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,821
YOU'VE GOT THIS WRONG.

488
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,858
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET YOUR
HEAD MIXED UP OVER OUR...

489
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:15,926
YOU KNOW, OUR OTHER PROBLEMS.

490
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,695
WHAT?

491
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:19,296
CONFLICTED INTERESTS, NO?

492
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:20,831
BE QUIET!

493
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,267
SHE'S A FLOWER.

494
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:24,001
SOMEONE NEEDS TO
APPRECIATE HER FOR MORE
THAN COOKING AND SEWING.

495
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:27,171
UGH!

496
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:45,823
Y-YOU GOT ANY WATER?

497
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:49,326
THERE'S NO WATER IN
THESE PACKS, FLEMMING.

498
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:53,030
THAT'S THE ONE THING
THESE MEN DON'T NEED.

499
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:53,764
THERE'S BOTTLES AND BOTTLES
OF THAT SPIKE IN THERE.

500
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,802
IT'LL MAKE YOU SICK.

501
00:33:58,803 --> 00:33:59,904
YOU, YOU CAN'T DROWN
A FISH IN WATER.

502
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,975
WE BOTH COULD USE IT.

503
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:05,843
JUST A FEW DROPS.

504
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:07,077
JUST A TASTE.

505
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:07,945
ANYTHING.

506
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,415
I CAN'T GO ANOTHER STEP.

507
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:19,757
TURN AROUND.

508
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,107
GET IT.

509
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:46,050
I KNOW THAT KNIFE.

510
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:47,518
HE'D NEVER SELL IT.

511
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:48,519
CAME OFF CALEB
IN THE SCUFFLE.

512
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:55,025
I GOT MY LICKS IN.

513
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,794
NO DOUBT.

514
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:10,274
I'M SORRY I TOOK
YOUR MACHINE, ERNEST.

515
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,981
I'M...

516
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:17,314
I'M SORRY WHAT I
SAID THE OTHER DAY.

517
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,520
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND OVER
TIME YOU CAN'T FIX WHAT YOU GOT.

518
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:28,892
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

519
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:29,226
THE STATE TOOK MY FATHER'S
LAND AND GAVE IT TO, UH,

520
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,465
WHATEVER YOU ARE.

521
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:37,201
NO RESOURCES, NO
SKILLS, NO MONEY.

522
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:44,108
AND IT DIED.

523
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:46,844
WHY'D THEY DO
THAT TO MY FATHER?

524
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:48,145
'CAUSE HE'S FROM
ANOTHER STATE?

525
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,414
'CAUSE HE'S SMART?

526
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:52,483
YOU BLAME.

527
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,518
YOU'RE GOD DAMNED
RIGHT I BLAME YOU!

528
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,687
THAT LAND WAS ALL WE HAD!

529
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,703
I'M LEAVING.

530
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:13,704
THOSE WATERMEN THAT
PAID ME WERE MY TICKET.

531
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,844
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'LL
DO TO YOU IF YOU RETURN WHAT

532
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,046
THEY WANT GONE.

533
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:24,348
I, I WOULDN'T' GO BACK
WITH THOSE SUPPLIES.

534
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,349
YOU KNOW ABOUT CALEB.

535
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,384
HE'LL TAKE IT OUT
OF ME IN FLESH.

536
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:29,353
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE HALFWAY
TO THE BORDER WITH THAT GEAR.

537
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,821
FETCHES TRIPLE IN
THE MOUNTAIN PASSES.

538
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,456
ANYTHING DOES.

539
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:33,957
I SWEAR.

540
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,560
I SWEAR ON MY DADDY'S SOUL.

541
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,063
THOSE WATERMEN ARE THE
ONES TO BLAME FOR ALL THIS.

542
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:45,202
NO, NO!

543
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,570
NO, LOOK.

544
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:47,404
YOU CAN HAVE HALF.

545
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,376
PARTNERS.

546
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,477
IF YOU WERE ANYONE ELSE I
WOULD'VE BURIED YOU THIS
MORNING.

547
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:00,984
IF I WERE ANYONE
ELSE, YOU'D UNDERSTAND.

548
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:04,154
NO.

549
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:07,458
LET'S GO.

550
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,262
LET'S GET YOU HOME.

551
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:15,833
FORGET THIS MESS, CUT A PATH,
RIGHT AWAYS.

552
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:19,036
COME ON.

553
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:23,707
LET'S GO SEE CALEB.

554
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:24,174
WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH
THAT BOTTLE, PUT IT ON THE
GROUND.

555
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,280
WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE
IT IN THIS CONDITION.

556
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:31,615
DO IT!

557
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:34,451
ERNEST, WE'RE TOO DEHYDRATED
TO MAKE IT UP THERE.

558
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,253
KNEEL DOWN.

559
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,421
HANDS...

560
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,962
HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.

561
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:48,599

NO WAY.

570
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:34,805
WE HAVE TO HURRY BEFORE
MY DAD GETS HOME.

571
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,596
YOU SAY A WORD TO DADDY, AND
I'LL BURN EVERY LAST DRAWING

572
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:00,664
OF YOURS.

573
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:25,989
WOO-WOOP!

574
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:32,029
ERNEST?

575
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:35,299
WOO-WOOP!

576
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:56,453
THE KID.

577
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,754
CHRIST ON A CRUTCH.

578
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:58,588
JEROME.

579
00:40:58,589 --> 00:40:59,723
IS MY FATHER WITH YOU SIRS?

580
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:01,992
NOW JEROME, NOW
HOLD ON THERE BOY.

581
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:02,993
ERNEST, I, I MEAN MY DAD
HASN'T COME BACK, AND OUR

582
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,099
MACHINE'S OVER THERE.

583
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,734
IF HE'S HAVING
ANY TROUBLES...

584
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:12,569
I KNOW SOMETIMES, IT'S HARD
FOR MEN, SO IF YOU COULD

585
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,207
GIVE THIS TO HIM.

586
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:26,583
JEROME BOY...

587
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:29,152
THERE'S BEEN A TERRIBLE
ACCIDENT WITH THAT MACHINE.

588
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:53,470
I TOOK THE LIBERTY
WITH THE TRUCK.

589
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:58,909
LET'S GET YOU BOTH FED.

590
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:48,558
IT'S NATURAL TO GRIEVE A
LOSS, STUD, BUT YOU HAVE TO

591
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:52,129
BE CAREFUL THAT YOUR GRIEF
DOESN'T TURN INTO BLAME.

592
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,098
BLAME IS THE LAZY PERSON'S
WAY OF MAKING SENSE OF CHAOS.

593
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:59,002
YOU KNOW, I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING,

594
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:04,241
NOW YOU'RE THE MAN.

595
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:04,941
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT THAT MACHINE, YEAH?

596
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,779
BUT...

597
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,015
WE CAN BOTH SEE IT'S, UH...

598
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,350
I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO
SAY IS I'M THINKING I COULD

599
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:18,822
STICK WITH THAT SUPPLY WORK,
TRY AND GET SOME OF THAT

600
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,157
WATER DOWN HERE.

601
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,925
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

602
00:44:21,926 --> 00:44:24,361
MY FATHER TRIED
A HUNDRED TIMES.

603
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:26,696
I KNOW, I KNOW.

604
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:27,464
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

605
00:44:27,465 --> 00:44:30,267
I JUST...

606
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:32,435
I JUST FIGURED MAYBE IT JUST
SORT OF NEEDS A, YOU KNOW, A

607
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:34,804
FRESH FACE.

608
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:37,107
MAYBE WE CAN TRY
JUST ONE MORE TIME.

609
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:38,742
I KNOW YOU WOULD
NEVER GIVE UP.

610
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:42,212
WELL, I'D LIKE TO HELP.

611
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,484
MAYBE IT'LL BE A GIFT.

612
00:44:47,485 --> 00:44:48,051
MY GIFT TO YOU,
MY GIFT TO MARY.

613
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:51,688
MY GIFT TO YOUR NEPHEW.

614
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:56,359
WHAT?

615
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,861
IT COULD BE A NIECE.

616
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:59,496
I THINK IT'S TOO
SMALL YET TO KNOW.

617
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,699
REALLY?

618
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:06,069
YEAH.

619
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:06,970
I'VE BEEN CALLED A LOT OF
NAMES BUT "DADDY" AIN'T ONE OF
THEM.

620
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:10,507
SHE WANTED ME TO TELL YOU.

621
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:19,249
I REALLY LOVE HER, STUD.

622
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,250
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

623
00:45:22,353 --> 00:45:26,790
IMAGINE WHAT THAT WATER
COULD DO FOR THIS LAND.

624
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:34,397
IF YOU GO UP THERE,
DON'T DRINK WITH THEM.

625
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:52,282
MUST BE TRYING WORK UP HERE.

626
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:54,851
EASY TO THINK THE LONELINESS
AND ISOLATION COULD MAKE A

627
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:56,519
MAN SAVAGE.

628
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,556
AND WITHOUT WOMEN
TO CUT THE GREASE...

629
00:45:59,557 --> 00:46:01,191
MUST MAKE YOU MAD.

630
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:04,361
WHAT WOULD YOU KNOW
ABOUT IT, HOME GROWN?

631
00:46:04,362 --> 00:46:04,794
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE
ACCOMPLISHED.

632
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:10,200
IT'S AMAZING WHAT MEN CAN
DO WHEN THEY PUT THEIR HEADS
TOGETHER.

633
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:10,900
I CAN'T RUB OUT A FLAME
WITH TWO STICKS, BUT THIS...

634
00:46:14,372 --> 00:46:15,472
YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY.

635
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:19,242
NOT WITHOUT ITS COSTS
THOUGH, I GUESS.

636
00:46:21,212 --> 00:46:22,979
ERNEST HOLM...

637
00:46:24,482 --> 00:46:26,950
I GUESS THEY CALL
IT A TRAGEDY.

638
00:46:29,754 --> 00:46:32,589
MM.

639
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:35,091
I DON'T LIKE THOSE
KINDS OF MACHINES.

640
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:37,994
DRAG A MAN TO HIS DEATH.

641
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:40,630
IT DON'T MAKE SENSE.

642
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,498
HOW DO YOU THINK
HIS KIDS FEEL?

643
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:45,502
LOOK, I KNOW ERNEST WRONGED
SOMETHING BY YOU ALL.

644
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:51,908
YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE THESE
CHALLENGES AT THE TIMES MAKE

645
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:54,611
HONEST PEOPLE CONFUSED
IN THEIR CHOOSING.

646
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:57,247
YOU KNOW, I LIKE TO SEE
TO MYSELF SOMETIMES.

647
00:46:57,248 --> 00:47:00,517
LIKE WE AGREED, IT CAN MAKE
YOU SAVAGE, PUT YOUR HANDS

648
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:03,920
ON A MAN, JUST BLOODY
SOMEONE FOR AN IDEA.

649
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:05,588
NOT SAYING IT'S NOT WITHOUT
CAUSE, YOU KNOW, A MAN

650
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:05,789
STEALS FROM ME,
STEALS PURE SURVIVAL?

651
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:12,362
YOU KNOW, A BEATING
SEEMS IN THE LINES.

652
00:47:12,363 --> 00:47:13,029
SOUND LIKE RHYMES.

653
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,032
JUST SAYING THE
WAY I HEAR IT.

654
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:17,267
TALK TALK.

655
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:20,370
ABOUT WHAT?

656
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:22,439
ABOUT...

657
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,609
WHAT YOU DID TO ERNEST
THAT NIGHT BEFORE HE DIED.

658
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:32,882
IF YOU WANT, I CAN TELL
THOSE KIDS EXACTLY WHAT

659
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:33,049
HAPPENED THAT NIGHT.

660
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:36,353
WHAT'S THAT?

661
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:46,863
TURNED UP IN HIS EFFECTS.

662
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:47,530
FAMILY'S THINKING
"WHAT IN THE HELL?"

663
00:47:50,668 --> 00:47:52,902
AND YOUR BOYS TALKING UP HERE
KEEP LATHERING THE TALE.

664
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:53,036
YOU KNOW, SOUNDS LIKE ONE
HELL OF A FIGHT BETWEEN YOU TWO.

665
00:47:56,574 --> 00:47:59,542
WHO KNOWS WHAT TO BELIEVE?

666
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,811
IF I'D SET TO DO SOMETHING
TO ERNEST HOLM, IT WOULDN'T

667
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:04,180
AMOUNT TO CONCUSSION, AND
THAT'S THE GOD DAMNED "TALK

668
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:07,417
TALK" AS YOU PUT IT.

669
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:08,785
NOW WHAT DO YOU WANT?

670
00:48:08,786 --> 00:48:10,653
WATER.

671
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:17,227
AND WHAT IN THE HELL ARE
YOU GOING TO DO WITH THAT?

672
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:19,028
THE LAND IS SICK.

673
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:20,196
NO IT'S NOT.

674
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:22,332
YOUR DADDY'S LAND
IS DEAD SICK.

675
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:23,533
KILLED IT WITH PESTICIDES.

676
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:24,834
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

677
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:27,270
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT HIS.

678
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:30,039
NOT ERNEST'S?

679
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,910
COME ON, YOU DO IT ALL THE
TIME FOR THE RIGHT PRICE.

680
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:38,014
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO
IT BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT.

681
00:48:41,352 --> 00:48:44,354
THE WATER LINE
TO ST. WALSTAN.

682
00:48:44,355 --> 00:48:46,189
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

683
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:52,629
PRAY FOR RAIN.

684
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:57,133
THAT SHIT'LL PUT
ME OUT OF BUSINESS.

685
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:07,577
BLUE SKIES, DRY BREEZE.

686
00:49:07,578 --> 00:49:10,246
OUT OF THE DUSTY EARTH.

687
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:11,648
THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE
COMPLAINED ABOUT FOR THEIR

688
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:11,815
BRUTAL CONSISTENCY CAN NOW
BE SEEN AS GOOD GRACES AND

689
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:18,588
FAIR WORKING CONDITIONS.

690
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:21,658
IN A FEW MOMENTS, THIS
TRIBUTARY WILL DISTRIBUTE

691
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:25,762
ITS LIFE SUSTAINING GIFTS
ON THIS SMALL PIECE OF LAND.

692
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:28,731
I RAISE THESE SCISSORS IN
THANKS TO THE STATE WATER WORKS.

693
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:31,167
WHO THANKFULLY REVERSED
THEIR DECISION TO RUN AN

694
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:31,401
IRRIDUCT TO ST. WALSTAN.

695
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:35,472
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE
WE'VE SEEN SUCH AN ACT OF

696
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:41,144
PEACE AND BROTHERHOOD
AROUND HERE.

697
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:42,212
FOR THIS, WE ARE
SINCERELY GRATEFUL.

698
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:45,648
LET US SAY A PRAYER.

699
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:48,618
THAT THIS PIECE OF LAND,
SMALL AS IT MAY BE, CAN BE

700
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,757
MORE THAN A SYMBOL.

701
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:57,293
THAT IT CAN STAND CULTIVATED
AS IT ONCE WAS BY OUR DEARLY

702
00:49:57,294 --> 00:49:57,427
DEPARTED ERNEST HOLM, WHOSE
PERSEVERANCE HELD THAT THIS

703
00:50:01,265 --> 00:50:06,269
LAND, FERTILE, COULD
FLOURISH ONCE AGAIN.

704
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:21,417
AND LET HIS CHILDREN
REAP ITS REWARD.

705
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:01,551
ALREADY.

706
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:03,386
EVERYTHING.

707
00:52:03,387 --> 00:52:04,721
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

708
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:08,191
IT'S ALMOST A SHAME
TO HARVEST IT.

709
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:13,296
WHAT'D YOUR FATHER
SAY ABOUT ALL THIS?

710
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,000
PROBABLY WOULDN'T
SAY ANYTHING.

711
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:20,670
YEAH.

712
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,607
BUT HE'D PROBABLY BE
THINKING YOU'RE ALRIGHT.

713
00:52:27,044 --> 00:52:27,810
REALLY?

714
00:54:33,704 --> 00:54:34,737
FLEM, YOU RIDE ON BACK.

715
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:36,272
I'LL SEE YOU WHEN
WE'RE THROUGH.

716
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,574
WHY ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT MY LAND?

717
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:39,976
IT'S NOT YOUR LAND, BOY.

718
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:41,878
MY WIFE, MY LAND.

719
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:42,912
NOT HER LAND NEITHER.

720
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:44,313
IT BELONGS TO THE BANK.

721
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:45,915
NOW YOU RIDE ON BACK, I'LL
COME AFTER AND WE'LL TALK

722
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:46,716
ABOUT IT.

723
00:54:46,717 --> 00:54:47,750
NO, WE'LL TALK NOW.

724
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:50,486
BOY, THIS IS ADULT
BUSINESS NOW.

725
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,825
GOD DAMN IT FLEMMING!

726
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:59,262
THE EXPLANATION
IS NOT IMPORTANT!

727
00:54:59,263 --> 00:55:00,763
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT
THE LAND IS HELD BY THE

728
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:01,998
BANK.

729
00:55:01,999 --> 00:55:03,466
ERNEST'S FARM'S BEEN IN
FORECLOSURE FOR YEARS.

730
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:05,835
HE JUST NEVER MOVED OFF AND
NOBODY WANTED TO BUY IT.

731
00:55:05,836 --> 00:55:08,571
NOW WITH THE WATER, THEY
MIGHT, AND YOU SHOULD BE

732
00:55:08,572 --> 00:55:11,174
DAMN PLEASED IF THEY DO.

733
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:12,575
HOW MUCH DOES HE OWE?

734
00:55:12,576 --> 00:55:14,844
MORE MONEY THAN YOU
CAN HOPE TO RAISE.

735
00:55:14,845 --> 00:55:15,812
NOW LISTEN...

736
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:17,814
WHAT DOES HE
OWE, GOD DAMN IT?

737
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,615
FLEMMING, YOU BE A MAN NOW.

738
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:21,818
HOW MUCH?

739
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,953
GO TALK TO THE BANK.

740
00:55:23,954 --> 00:55:25,755
SORRY ABOUT THAT DOCTOR.

741
00:55:25,756 --> 00:55:27,690
JUST A LOCAL BOY.

742
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:30,226
VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THE
HISTORY OF THESE PLOTS.

743
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:37,800
FLEM?

744
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:39,468
HEY, LET ME HELP YOU.

745
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:40,503
WHAT?

746
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:41,537
I SAID LET ME HELP.
- DON'T WORRY.

747
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:42,605
I GOT IT.

748
00:55:42,606 --> 00:55:43,806
WHERE ARE YOU
TAKING THE MACHINE?

749
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:45,675
I NEED TO GO TO
THE MOUNTAINS.

750
00:55:59,223 --> 00:56:00,456
COME ON.

751
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:03,426
I FOUND SOMEBODY TO
TELL US WHAT IT'S WORTH.

752
00:56:03,427 --> 00:56:03,793
FLEM AND MARY ARE GOING TO
SELL THEIR BABY WHEN IT'S BORN.

753
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:09,699
THEY NEED OUR HELP TO FIND
OUT WHAT THEY CAN GET FOR IT.

754
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,267
OKAY.

755
00:56:11,268 --> 00:56:12,702
WRAP THE BABY IN A
BLANKET AND HURRY BACK.

756
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:29,752
HE KEEPS CHANGING HIS
MIND, BUT HE SAID YES.

757
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:31,721
IT'S TOO LATE FOR
SECOND THOUGHTS.

758
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:34,090
I'VE ALREADY GOT
A BUYER LINED UP.

759
00:56:34,091 --> 00:56:36,926
SEND HIM OUT HERE.

760
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:41,697
WHY'D THEY GIVE
YOU THAT MONEY?

761
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:43,866
I THOUGHT WE WERE JUST HERE
TO FIND OUT WHAT IT WAS WORTH.

762
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:44,734
OH, THEY JUST...

763
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:46,736
JUST WANT TO
TALK TO YOU PAL.

764
00:56:50,207 --> 00:56:51,507
WHAT'S UP, WHAT'S UP?

765
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:52,909
LISTEN HERE.

766
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,677
I DON'T WANT ANY
KIND OF TROUBLE.

767
00:56:54,678 --> 00:56:56,212
I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE
GETTING COLD FEET.

768
00:56:56,213 --> 00:56:59,048
THE DEAL IS DONE AND THESE
MEN ARE TAKING THAT BABY.

769
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:01,017
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

770
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:01,584
NO!

771
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:03,052
FLEM! FLEM!

772
00:57:03,053 --> 00:57:03,686
ROBBIE, I'M SORRY!

773
00:57:03,687 --> 00:57:04,754
RAAGH!

774
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:13,462
SHOOT HIM TOO!

775
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:31,447
FLEM!

776
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,248
FLEM!

777
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:04,146
BANK AIN'T NEVER
KICKING US OFF.

778
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:08,985
COME ON, THIS IS
A HOORAH, STUD.

779
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:10,653
GIVE ME SOMETHING.

780
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:11,854
I JUST SAVED THE FARM.

781
00:58:11,855 --> 00:58:14,357
WHO'D YOU SELL THE SIM TO?

782
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:20,129
ROBBIE, OF COURSE.

783
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:20,930
AREN'T YOU HAPPY?

784
00:58:20,931 --> 00:58:22,932
YOU HATED THAT DAMN THING.

785
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:51,494
<i>COME ON
DOWN, WE LOVE CHEETAHS.</i>

786
00:58:51,495 --> 00:58:54,130
<i>X MARKS THE SPOT ON THE
 FOUR, SO COME ON DOWN AND</i>

787
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:56,532
<i>SEE COCO, LAZY AND
 ME, CALVIN HOYMAN.</i>

788
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,067
<i>WHERE THE VEHICLES VARY, BUT
 THE DEALS ARE ALL THE SAME.</i>

789
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:02,038
THIS IS CALVIN HOYMAN,
CALLING FROM CALVIN HOYMAN

790
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:05,374
AUTO WORKS.

791
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,209
I'M TRYING TO REACH
ERNEST HOLM, OVER.

792
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,411
<i>THIS
IS HIS SON JEROME, OVER.</i>

793
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:14,050
WELL, I'M STANDING HERE IN
SUNNY, BEAUTIFUL OVERBLUFF

794
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:15,518
WITH YOUR SIMULIT SHADOW.

795
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:17,820
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU LOST
IT, BUT ITS DEFAULT SETTINGS

796
00:59:17,821 --> 00:59:20,723
SENT IT BACK TO ME, OVER.

797
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:24,660
WE HAVE THE FINEST BIRDS
FROM CALIFORNIA TO NEW YORK
CITY!

798
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:27,830
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IS
YOUR MONEY ON THE TABLE?

799
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:29,398
THE BETTING IS NOW CLOSED.

800
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,033
YOU DON'T PLAY,
YOU CAN'T WIN!

801
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:32,435
WANT TO LIVE A LIFE
OF EASE AND LUXURY?

802
00:59:32,436 --> 00:59:33,369
I'M YOUR MAN!

803
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:35,438
THREE, TWO, ONE, LET EM GO!

804
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:56,092
JESUS, SOOZ.

805
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:57,326
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

806
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:01,630
ROBBIE SAID TO, UNTIL HE GOT
BACK, SO NOBODY'D ASK ANY
QUESTIONS.

807
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:07,436
COME ON.

808
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:08,204
FLEM?

809
01:00:08,205 --> 01:00:09,405
THE FUCK YOU DOING HERE?

810
01:00:09,406 --> 01:00:10,806
A-A CALL CAME IN ON THE CB.

811
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:12,241
THEY SAID THAT...

812
01:00:12,242 --> 01:00:12,441
YEAH, I'M GONNA RUN SOOZ HOME.
THE BABY'S GOT A FEVER.

813
01:00:29,259 --> 01:00:31,227
WHAT WAS ALL THAT ABOUT THE
CB CALL DOWN AT THE BIRD

814
01:00:31,228 --> 01:00:33,028
RACE TODAY?

815
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:33,929
UM...

816
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:38,134
I, I WAS JUST THINING
ABOUT THE SIM.

817
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:40,402
I DON'T WANT ROBBIE TO HIT
HER OR BREAK HER UP FOR

818
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:41,837
SPARE PARTS OR SOMETHING.

819
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:43,072
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

820
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:44,340
ROBBIE'S LONG GONE
WITH THAT MENACE.

821
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:46,175
DON'T YOU LISTEN
WHEN WE TALK?

822
01:00:46,176 --> 01:00:47,510
WHO CARES WHAT
HE DOES WITH IT?

823
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:50,579
THAT JUNKER CAUSED NOTHING
BUT GRIEF IN THIS HOUSE.

824
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,715
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANOTHER
WORD, TOO, ON THE SUBJECT.

825
01:00:52,716 --> 01:00:53,749
WHO'S CALLING ON THE CB?

826
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:02,124
AT THE HOSPITAL.

827
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:04,293
MAMA WANTED ME TO VISIT HER,
SO I CAME DOWN TO SEE IF YOU

828
01:01:04,294 --> 01:01:07,029
COULD GIVE ME A RIDE.

829
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:08,964
WELL, THE BUS TO
QUINCY'S RUNNING AGAIN.

830
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:11,667
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

831
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,369
NOTHING.

832
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:15,471
SORT OF LIKE WHAT GOES ON
IN YOUR HEAD THESE DAYS.

833
01:01:15,472 --> 01:01:16,839
THAT'S A FINE IDEA.

834
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,040
GET YOU OFF YOUR HEELS,
YOU'RE GOING TO REPORT BACK

835
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:19,375
WHERE ALL THAT MONEY
WE SPEND ON HER GOES.

836
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:49,572
<i>ALL UNATTENDED BAGGAGE
 WILL BE REMOVED AND DESTROYED.</i>

837
01:01:53,677 --> 01:01:56,812
<i>NO UNLICENSED FRUITS,
VEGETABLES OR LIVESTOCK</i>

838
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:58,214
<i>ALLOWED ACROSS THE BORDER.</i>

839
01:01:58,215 --> 01:02:00,416
GET YOUR VERSAPASSES OUT!

840
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:03,586
COME ON! COME ON!

841
01:02:03,587 --> 01:02:05,588
I CAN'T READ THAT WHEN
IT'S IN YOUR POCKET!

842
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:08,557
GET YOUR VERSAPASS OUT...

843
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,726
VERSAPASSES ONLY!

844
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:11,560
KEEP IT MOVING FORWARD!

845
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:15,097
GET YOUR VERSAPASSES OUT!

846
01:02:18,335 --> 01:02:20,169
VERSAPASSES OUT!

847
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:21,237
ARE YOU A MINOR?

848
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:21,870
WHAT?

849
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:23,239
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

850
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,207
14 AND A HALF, SIR.

851
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:26,675
WITH YOUR PARENTS?

852
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:28,344
DO YOU GOT A GUARDIAN?

853
01:02:28,345 --> 01:02:30,212
BETTER HEAD BACK TO
WHICHEVER WAY YOU CAME, YOU

854
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:31,547
GOT IT?

855
01:02:31,548 --> 01:02:34,049
YOU GOTTA BE 18 TO ENTER
THE REAL WORLD ALONE, BOY.

856
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,518
YOU CAN'T BE IN THIS LINE.

857
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:39,555
NOW MOVE IT!

858
01:02:39,556 --> 01:02:39,955
GET YOUR VERSAPASSES OUT!

859
01:02:42,993 --> 01:02:43,292
YOU HEARD ME!

860
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:46,028
HEY.

861
01:02:46,029 --> 01:02:47,363
I CAN GET YOU ACROSS
FOR A THROWAWAY PRICE.

862
01:02:57,907 --> 01:03:00,142
YOU WANT THE ROUND TRIP, SO
IT'S 100 EACH WAY PLUS 50

863
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:01,543
FOR THE CELL PHONE.

864
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:05,281
ONCE WE START MOVING,
SIT TIGHT AND BE SILENT.

865
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:07,983
YOU'LL KNOW WHEN WE'RE
ACROSS 'CAUSE THE ROAD GETS
SMOOTH.

866
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:08,484
IF THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG, PRESS SEND ON THIS.

867
01:03:11,054 --> 01:03:11,920
AND IT REALLY WORKS?

868
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:14,990
PICKS UP A SIGNAL
HERE SOMETIMES.

869
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:16,992
IT'LL DEFINITELY WORK
ONCE WE'RE ACROSS.

870
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:18,327
SHH!

871
01:03:32,509 --> 01:03:33,676
HELLO?

872
01:03:33,677 --> 01:03:34,777
<i>SORRY.</i>

873
01:03:34,778 --> 01:03:35,911
<i>I WAS JUST SEEING
 IF IT WORKED.</i>

874
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:37,446
OKAY, WELL HANG UP.

875
01:03:37,447 --> 01:03:39,682
<i>WAIT, I WANTED
 TO KNOW SOMETHING.</i>

876
01:03:39,683 --> 01:03:41,016
WHAT?

877
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:44,320

I'M JEROME.

882
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:58,934
JUST IN CASE WE NEED TO
FIND EACH OTHER OR IT'S LOUD

883
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:00,636
WHERE WE END UP.

884
01:04:00,637 --> 01:04:03,772
<i>OKAY, THAT'S ALL. BYE.</i>

885
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:41,910

01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:47,249
WHAT?

889
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,584
I SAID YES.

890
01:04:48,585 --> 01:04:49,885
YES?

891
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,320

894
01:04:55,325 --> 01:04:58,360
OH.

895
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:01,096
I DON'T HAVE HORNS,

896
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:02,231
BUT I DO BITE.

897

COME ON, KID.

899
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:15,377
SO YOU'RE STUCK
IN THOSE CAMPS?

900
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:17,079
DO I LOOK STUCK?

901
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,447
WE FIGHT TO GET
OUR LAND BACK.

902
01:05:18,448 --> 01:05:22,384
THERE'S NOTHING
STUCK ABOUT THAT.

903
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:25,687
I DON'T HAVE MY GUN ON
ME, BUT I'VE GOT ONE.

904
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:27,122
I'VE GOT A DUALIE RIFLE.

905
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:28,791
SLAM.

906

I HAVE . 45.

907
01:05:30,894 --> 01:05:33,729
I SHARE IT WITH A
FEW PEOPLE THOUGH.

908
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:36,298
HM. MINE'S MY FATHER'S.

909
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:38,267
YOU KILL ANYONE?

910
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:39,601

911
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:40,969
YOU?

912
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:42,771
A GOAT.

01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,139
SORT OF.

914
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:46,809
BUT WE ATE IT, SO...

915
01:05:50,547 --> 01:05:51,346
I'VE SEEN PEOPLE KILLED.

916
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:54,917
ME TOO.

917
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,387
DO YOU DREAM ABOUT THEM?

918
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:03,759
NO.

919
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,561
GOOD.

920
01:06:05,562 --> 01:06:06,195
I'M FUCKING HAUNTED.

921
01:06:07,664 --> 01:06:10,299
"WHERE THE VEHICLES VARY,
BUT THE DEALS ARE ALL THE SAME!"

922
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:16,638
WELL...

923
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:25,681
KEEP THAT HUNDRED.

924
01:06:25,682 --> 01:06:27,983
THE WHOLE ROUND
TRIP THING'S A SCAM.

925
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:28,984
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

926
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,352
TO CROSS BACK OVER.

927
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:31,353
IT'S A SCAM.

928
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:32,521
YOU DON'T NEED TO CALL US.

929
01:06:32,522 --> 01:06:34,790
JUST WALK RIGHT THROUGH.

930
01:06:34,791 --> 01:06:36,425
THE BORDER GUARDS
WON'T STOP YOU.

931
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:39,495
THEY DON'T CARE
YOU'RE GOING BACK.

932
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:40,796
OKAY.

933
01:06:40,797 --> 01:06:42,297
THANK YOU.

934
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:46,201
OKAY.

935
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:50,105
HEY, REAL QUICK.

YOU EVER MEET A
MAN NAMED ERNEST?

938
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,114
ERNEST?

939
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:00,215
YOU KNOW, LIKE A GUY.

940
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:01,850
NOT LIKE AN OLD MAN.

941
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:02,985
ERNEST...

942
01:07:02,986 --> 01:07:05,120
ERNEST HOLM.

943
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:07,856
MM.... I DON'T KNOW.

944
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,192
I MEET A LOT OF PEOPLE.

945
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:13,061
I DON'T.

946
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:19,234
ERNEST HOLM...

947
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:21,203
IT'S IMPORTANT.

948
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:24,406
MM...

949
01:07:25,475 --> 01:07:27,509
I'M SORRY.

950
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:28,677

01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:35,584
BYE BYE, JEROME.

BYE BYE.

954
01:07:51,501 --> 01:07:55,571
SORRY TO WAKE YOU.

955
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:01,209
YOU KNOW, I SOLD YOUR
MACHINE TEN YEARS AGO FOR A

956
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:03,078
REFORESTATION PROJECT.

957
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,346
SIX OWNERS SINCE THEN.

958
01:08:04,347 --> 01:08:06,582
I LOVE THINKING ABOUT
ALL THEY'VE SEEN.

959
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,450
THEM WHEAT FARMS OF YOURS
ARE NEVER SUPPOSED TO BE AS

960
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:10,352
FAR WEST AS THEY ARE.

961
01:08:10,353 --> 01:08:13,021
YOU EVER HEARD OF
MANIFEST DESTINY?

962
01:08:13,022 --> 01:08:13,956
NO SIR.

963
01:08:13,957 --> 01:08:15,357
I LIKE HISTORY.

964
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:17,059
EVERYONE'S SO DAMNED SCARED
TO REPEAT IT, THEY NEVER

965
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:19,428
THOUGHT HOW BAD THE
ALTERNATIVES WAS.

966
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:21,263
NOW LOOK AROUND
AT THIS WORLD.

967
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:23,732
SEEMS TO ME, REPEAT BUSINESS
TO THE WELL OF BAD IDEAS

968
01:08:23,733 --> 01:08:27,436
WOULD'VE PUT US ALL A LOT
BETTER OFF THAN WE ARE TODAY.

969
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,938
YOU KNOW WHAT
CONSERVATISM IS?

970
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,440
NO SIR.

971
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:33,442
WELL, THAT'S GONE TOO.

972
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:34,376
PREPARE YOURSELF.

973
01:08:34,377 --> 01:08:36,511
SHE'S A SIGHT.

974
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:37,613
OKAY, BEAUTY.

975
01:08:38,815 --> 01:08:41,450
LET'S SEE WHAT
THEY DID TO YOU.

976
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:42,250
ALRIGHT, LET'S GET
THIS GOING.

977
01:08:44,387 --> 01:08:46,755
<i>CALVIN, PICK UP EXTENSION 454.</i>

978
01:08:46,756 --> 01:08:49,458
<i>CALVIN, PLEASE PICK
 UP EXTENSION 454.</i>

979
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,426
WHAT'S THAT?

980
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:53,228
LOOK FAMILIAR?

981
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:53,962
THAT'S ME.

982
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,631
UH HUH.

983
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,967
EVER SEEN THIS?

984
01:09:00,837 --> 01:09:02,170
THAT'S ITS FACE.

985
01:09:02,171 --> 01:09:03,105
THAT'S RIGHT.

986
01:09:03,106 --> 01:09:04,640
IT'S ITS EYES.

987
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:08,343
AVOIDS OBJECTS AND OBSTACLES
USING A LASER GUIDANCE SYSTEM.

988
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:09,011
LASERS MEASURE DISTANCE,
TERRAIN, GRADE OF SLOPES AND
THINGS.

989
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:15,917
THE LASER REFLECTION
INFORMATION IS CAPTURED, AND

990
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:18,620
ON THIS MONITOR, WE CAN SEE
IMAGES OF THE LANDSCAPE AND

991
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:20,989
ITS SURROUNDINGS.

992
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,759
IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
LOOKING AT, IT COMES CLEAR.

993
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:24,893
THIS DIAL CAN JUST SHUTTLE
AROUND, FIND WHERE IT GAVE

994
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:30,532
TROUBLE OR BROKE DOWN.

995
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:32,501
MAYBE SEE WHY.

996
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:34,703
<i>CALVIN, PLEASE COME TO THE
 SHOWROOM.</i>

997
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:38,306
<i>CALVIN, PLEASE COME
TO THE SHOWROOM.</i>

998
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:40,208
WE'RE GETTING ON THE
BODY WORK TOUT SUITE.

999
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:42,110
IT SHALL BE TIP TOP.

1000
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:43,845
EXCUSE ME A MOMENT.

1001
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:11,206
THIS IS A MACHINE, THE
SIMULIT

1002
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:12,240
SHADOW.

1003
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:15,410
LOOK AT THAT, IN
VERY GOOD WORK...

1004
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:20,482
THE MACHINE HURT?

1005
01:10:20,483 --> 01:10:24,086
NO,I'M JUST THINKING IT
KNOWS HOW

1006
01:10:24,087 --> 01:10:26,154
HARD THE WORK'S
GONNA BE AROUND HERE.

1007
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:32,420
THOSE WATERMEN
PAID ME TO TAKE IT.

1008
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:34,489
THERE'S INSURANCE
MONEY IN IT.

1009
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:41,082
WHAT'S THAT?

1010
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:44,419
IT'S RAINING.

1011
01:14:06,142 --> 01:14:08,710
JESUS, STUD.

1012
01:14:08,711 --> 01:14:10,378
IT'S AN ACT OF GOD.

1013
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:12,781
THOUGHT THAT FUCKER
HAD ABANDONED US.

1014
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:15,350
GUESS HE LEFT JUST TO HITCH
A JACKPOT AND DRAG IT BACK.

1015
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:18,753
HOW'S YOUR MOTHER?

1016
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:21,423
SHE REALLY APPRECIATES
EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING FOR

1017
01:14:22,992 --> 01:14:24,826
HER WITH THE MONEY.

1018
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:28,263
IT'S A PLEASURE.

1019
01:14:28,264 --> 01:14:31,666
I'M GONNA GO SEE HER AGAIN
THIS WEEK, IF THAT'S OKAY.

1020
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:33,234
TOLD HER I'D SPEND
THE NIGHT AGAIN.

1021
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:36,604
AH, HER SWEET BOY.

1022
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:39,908
HOW'D YOU GET
THE SIMULIT BACK?

1023
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:42,010
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1024
01:14:42,011 --> 01:14:43,845
YOU KNOW, OUR MACHINE.

1025
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:45,246
THE SHADOW.

1026
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:47,148
WHEN YOU SOLD IT TO ROBBIE,
HOW'D YOU GET IT BACK?

1027
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:48,616
I DIDN'T.

1028
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:53,321
IT'S OUT THERE IN THE BARN.

1029
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:56,091
SAW IT AS I WALKED
IN FROM THE ROAD.

1030
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:02,030
IT'S ALL CLEANED UP,
BUT IT'S OURS ALRIGHT.

1031
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:11,306
YEAH, ROBBIE MUST'VE
BROUGHT IT BACK.

1032
01:15:11,307 --> 01:15:13,008
IF HE THINK HE'S GETTING A
REFUND, IF HE'S REALLY AS

1033
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:15,577
DUMB AS HE IS...

1034
01:15:15,578 --> 01:15:16,511
GLAD TO HAVE HER
BACK, THOUGH.

1035
01:15:20,116 --> 01:15:23,218
CAN'T BLAME HER FOR
EVERYTHING, RIGHT?

1036
01:15:23,219 --> 01:15:25,120
YEAH, SURE STUD.

1037
01:15:25,121 --> 01:15:27,055
I'LL GO TALK TO ROBBIE.

1038
01:15:38,067 --> 01:15:40,735
DO YOU BELIEVE IT?

1039
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:43,805
JUST WISH YOUR
FATHER COULD SEE IT.

1040
01:15:48,811 --> 01:15:49,778
MARY WON'T TELL ME IF SHE'S
HAVING A BOY OR A GIRL.

1041
01:15:53,249 --> 01:15:56,584
THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW.

1042
01:15:56,585 --> 01:15:59,687
I DON'T WANT TO
BE CALLED GRANDMA.

1043
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:00,522
I'M PUTTING YOU
IN CHARGE OF THAT.

1044
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:07,495
OKAY.

1045
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:08,329
YOU'LL HAVE TO COME UP WITH
A WHOLE NEW NAME FOR ME.

1046
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:14,402
YOU LIKE THE IDEA OF THAT?

1047
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,671
THINK ABOUT IT.

1048
01:16:21,177 --> 01:16:23,478
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

1049
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:26,948
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

1050
01:16:30,553 --> 01:16:31,252
I'LL WORRY ABOUT
YOU, LIKE ERNEST.

1051
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:36,424
LIKE DAD.

1052
01:16:40,563 --> 01:16:43,565
THIS BOY, FLEMMING.

1053
01:16:43,566 --> 01:16:46,634
DOES HE MAKE HER HAPPY?

1054
01:16:48,838 --> 01:16:49,804
YES.

1055
01:16:52,308 --> 01:16:53,041
HE HOLDS HER UP?

1056
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:55,810
HE'S A GOOD MAN?

1057
01:16:55,811 --> 01:16:57,512
A GOOD BOY?

1058
01:16:57,513 --> 01:16:59,080
YES.

1059
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:28,476
I'M SORRY.

1060
01:17:31,514 --> 01:17:33,114
GOD DAMN VULTURES
HEADING WEST AGAIN.

1061
01:17:35,451 --> 01:17:37,819
THEY'LL EAT ALL
OUR NEW SEED.

1062
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:39,320
THIS THING DON'T
FIRE STRAIGHT.

1063
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:40,822
PIECE OF SHIT.

1064
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:16,157
WHO KNEW ABOUT YOU.

1065
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:18,059
YOU'RE MESSING WITH
MY SIGHTS, CHEATER?

1066
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,360
LUCKY SHOT.

1067
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:20,528
IT IS OFF.

1068
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,397
I'LL TAKE IT IN
TOWN TO GET FIXED.

1069
01:18:22,398 --> 01:18:22,730
<i>OKAY, FUNNYMAN.</i>

1070
01:18:23,799 --> 01:18:25,066
<i>MAKE YOUR JOKES.</i>

1071
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:27,068
<i>BUT I'M GOING TO LAY
DOWN THE LAW RIGHT NOW!</i>

1072
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:36,678
<i>I KEEP THE
 RENT MONEY IN THE OLD COFFEE</i>

1073
01:18:36,679 --> 01:18:38,146
<i>POT AND, I KEEP THE...</i>

1074
01:18:38,147 --> 01:18:40,682
<i>WELL WHY'D THE LANDLORD
 COME TO ME FOR THE MONEY?</i>

1075
01:18:40,683 --> 01:18:42,917
<i>OH, WELL THAT WAS
 A MISUNDERSTANDING.</i>

1076
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:45,420
<i>I WAS BUSY WHEN HE CAME, SO
 I SAID "GO TO THE OLD POT</i>

1077
01:18:45,421 --> 01:18:46,354
<i>AND GET THE MONEY"</i>

1078
01:18:52,928 --> 01:18:55,230
<i>I'M GOING DOWN TOWN
 TO PAY THESE BILLS.</i>

1079
01:19:00,502 --> 01:19:00,868
I SPOKE TO ROBBIE TODAY.

1080
01:19:02,171 --> 01:19:04,172
WHAT'S THAT?

1081
01:19:06,375 --> 01:19:08,843
ON THE RADIO.

1082
01:19:08,844 --> 01:19:10,912
HE WAS LOOKING FOR
YOU, ROBBIE WAS.

1083
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:13,014
WHAT DID HE SAY?

1084
01:19:13,015 --> 01:19:14,916
JUST THAT HE'S
LOOKING FOR YOU.

1085
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:16,284
WHERE IS HE?

1086
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:21,089
HE DIDN'T SAY.

1087
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:21,389
WELL WHAT DID HE SAY?

1088
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:25,026
JUST SAID HE WAS
LOOKING FOR YOU.

1089
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:28,896
THAT WAS IT.

1090
01:19:29,832 --> 01:19:32,233
WHAT, ON THE...

1091
01:19:33,469 --> 01:19:35,270
ON THE TEN METER?

1092
01:19:36,472 --> 01:19:38,473
YEAH.

1093
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:42,143
DID HE GIVE A CHANNEL
TO RADIO BACK ON?

1094
01:19:42,144 --> 01:19:45,280
HE SAID HE WAS ON
SOMEONE ELSE'S HANDLE.

1095
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:48,283
WHAT, SOMEONE ELSE'S HANDLE
OR SOMEONE ELSE'S RADIO?

1096
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:49,450
HANDLE, I THINK.

1097
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:51,386
HANDLE.

1098
01:19:51,387 --> 01:19:52,520
HUH.

1099
01:19:52,521 --> 01:19:53,454
YEAH.

1100
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:01,162
THAT'S A LIE.

1101
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:04,966
I DON'T KNOW, THAT'S
JUST WHAT HE SAID.

1102
01:20:06,435 --> 01:20:08,136
NO, NOT HIM.

1103
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:10,571
YOU. THAT'S A LIE, THAT LAST
PART.

1104
01:20:10,572 --> 01:20:12,073
FLEM...

1105
01:20:12,074 --> 01:20:13,408
ROBBIE DOESN'T HAVE A RADIO,
SO HE DOESN'T HAVE A HANDLE,

1106
01:20:13,409 --> 01:20:14,909
SO HE DIDN'T CALL HERE.

1107
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:15,777
TELL HER.

1108
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:22,016
I SAW WHAT YOU THOUGHT.

1109
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:23,851
I SAW WHAT YOU JUST THOUGHT.

1110
01:20:23,852 --> 01:20:24,786
FLEM, STOP IT.

1111
01:20:24,787 --> 01:20:25,820
ROBBIE CALLED,
LOOKING FOR ME.

1112
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,021
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID?

1113
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:27,755
YES.

1114
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:28,423
AND YOU SPOKE TO HIM?

1115
01:20:28,424 --> 01:20:29,657
YEP.

1116
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,426
OKAY.

1117
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:45,473
AND THE REST OF THIS LAND
WOULDN'T COST YOU ANYTHING

1118
01:20:45,474 --> 01:20:46,808
UP FRONT.

1119
01:20:46,809 --> 01:20:48,810
WHAT, IT'S ALL OF IT?

1120
01:20:48,811 --> 01:20:51,112
PROBABLY THE LINE RUNS FROM
THE BASALT COMPRESSION TO

1121
01:20:51,113 --> 01:20:52,480
THE FOOTHILLS.

1122
01:20:52,481 --> 01:20:55,149
FROM THE FOOTHILLS, IT RUNS
ALMOST DIAGONAL RIGHT TO

1123
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:57,352
WHERE YOU STAND.

1124
01:20:57,353 --> 01:20:58,353

01:21:52,007 --> 01:21:53,741
IS THAT TAXABLE OR USABLE?

01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:55,209
BUT IT'S PITCH BLACK OUT.

1144
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:59,547
THERE'S BARELY A MOON.

1145
01:21:59,548 --> 01:22:01,682
I'VE GOT TO STAKE THE NEW

I'M NOT GOING TO

01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:36,750
IS HE BUYING
SOMETHING, SELLING...

1248
01:32:36,751 --> 01:32:37,217
JUST... JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:46,527
JUST WAIT FOR NOW.

1251
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:01,442
YOU SHOULD GO
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

1252
01:33:01,443 --> 01:33:04,244
THAT'S A LONG TRIP
TO THE HOSPITAL?

1253
01:33:04,245 --> 01:33:06,747
HOW IS MOMMA?

1254
01:33:06,748 --> 01:33:10,050
IT'S SWEET OF YOU TO GO
VISIT HER SO MUCH LATELY.

1255
01:33:10,051 --> 01:33:12,920
I'D LIKE TO SEE HER TOO.

1256
01:33:12,921 --> 01:33:15,355
WE COULD EVEN MOVE
HER BACK IN, RIGHT?

1257
01:33:15,356 --> 01:33:20,761
WE'D HAVE THE MONEY TO BUILD
HER BRACE WIRES HERE NOW, NO?

1258
01:33:24,032 --> 01:33:25,499
HE WOULDN'T LIKE THAT.

1259
01:33:26,534 --> 01:33:29,470

1263
01:33:44,552 --> 01:33:45,385
FUNNY, WHY?
