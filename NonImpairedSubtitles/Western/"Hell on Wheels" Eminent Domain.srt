1
00:00:09,685 --> 00:00:12,453
I see why they call this place
"Hell On Wheels."

2
00:00:12,487 --> 00:00:14,055
Rough men, loose women,

3
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:16,223
whiskey, sin, and guns.

4
00:00:16,258 --> 00:00:19,026
It ain't
a church social, ma'am.

5
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,661
I'm not sure your bosses
at Credit Mobilier

6
00:00:20,696 --> 00:00:23,698
would want me to put <i>that</i>
in the newspaper.

7
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,333
What is it that holds you to
this enterprise, Mr. Bohannon?

8
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,635
Every piece of steel we lay

9
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:29,637
puts us closer
to somewheres else.

10
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:31,872
That's about all I can say.

11
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:36,010
So it's more personal
than just laying rail.

12
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:39,580
You're the writer.
Ho!

13
00:00:39,614 --> 00:00:41,915
Mr. Bohannon,
people of this country

14
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,152
believe the railroad is robbing
the National Treasury.

15
00:00:45,186 --> 00:00:47,521
My job is to dissuade my readers
of that notion.

16
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:50,591
Unfortunately,
our brief interview

17
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,326
was not enough to dissuade me.

18
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,095
And it ain't my job
to fix what people think.

19
00:00:55,129 --> 00:00:56,863
In fact, it is.

20
00:00:56,898 --> 00:00:59,199
You are the face of the
Transcontinental Railroad now.

21
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:01,935
And either this is
a brave and noble endeavor,

22
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:04,104
or it's Sodom and Gomorrah.

23
00:01:04,138 --> 00:01:07,707
Which is it?

24
00:01:07,742 --> 00:01:09,442
The sooner you help me
accurately report

25
00:01:09,477 --> 00:01:10,944
what's going on out here,
the sooner I can leave

26
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:13,680
and make both our lives
less miserable.

27
00:01:13,714 --> 00:01:15,949
And for the record,
I covered the war '63 to '65.

28
00:01:15,983 --> 00:01:18,418
I know the difference between
hell and a church social.

29
00:01:18,452 --> 00:01:21,187
What more you need to see?

30
00:01:21,222 --> 00:01:25,759
Everything.

31
00:01:25,793 --> 00:01:28,094
Come on then.

32
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:30,363
♪ That I ever did see
♪ that I ever did see

33
00:01:30,397 --> 00:01:32,765
♪ she was born
in Jackson, baby ♪

34
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,267
♪ raised in New Orleans

35
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:36,803
Grading crews work ahead
of the tie-layers.

36
00:01:36,837 --> 00:01:39,272
100 miles west,
surveyors lay out the route.

37
00:01:39,306 --> 00:01:41,741
- How many men do you have?
- Near 3,000.

38
00:01:41,775 --> 00:01:43,910
Work six days a week,
sunup, sundown.

39
00:01:43,944 --> 00:01:46,946
$1.50 a day.
Them's good wages.

40
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,948
How many miles do you make
a day?

41
00:01:48,982 --> 00:01:52,251
Two now,
weather and Indians permittin'.

42
00:01:55,088 --> 00:01:56,989
Rust eaters lay the rails.

43
00:01:57,024 --> 00:01:59,558
Walking boss makes sure
the gauge is right.

44
00:01:59,593 --> 00:02:02,995
Spiker teams secure the rails
to the ground.

45
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:05,297
Fish-plates tie them together.

46
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:07,333
3 swings of the hammer
per spike,

47
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:11,003
10 spikes per rail,
400 rails to a mile,

48
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:14,039
1,500 miles to Sacramento.

49
00:02:16,543 --> 00:02:18,110
Do you really believe
you can win the race

50
00:02:18,144 --> 00:02:19,812
against the Central Pacific
to build this road?

51
00:02:19,846 --> 00:02:21,347
Wouldn't be here otherwise.

52
00:02:21,381 --> 00:02:22,915
You think you can do it

53
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:24,450
without Thomas Durant's
political connections?

54
00:02:24,484 --> 00:02:26,652
Without his money,
his ego to drive it on?

55
00:02:26,686 --> 00:02:30,189
Well, here I stand,
and here he don't.

56
00:02:30,223 --> 00:02:34,626
- Excuse me.
- One more question.

57
00:02:34,661 --> 00:02:37,396
Why you?

58
00:02:47,373 --> 00:02:49,941
Each car sleeps 60 men.

59
00:02:49,976 --> 00:02:52,944
Keeps them out of the weather
and close to the work.

60
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:55,981
Lady coming through.

61
00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:02,120
Who designed these cars?

62
00:03:02,154 --> 00:03:03,388
Mostly me.

63
00:03:06,192 --> 00:03:09,728
Yeah, I'm still working out
the ventilation.

64
00:03:09,762 --> 00:03:11,463
Mmhmm.

65
00:03:11,497 --> 00:03:13,064
Two weeks ago, these men
were starving, out of work,

66
00:03:13,098 --> 00:03:15,033
straight off the boats
in New York.

67
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:16,401
My newspaper has reported
Irish labor bosses

68
00:03:16,435 --> 00:03:18,069
conscripting them out here
for a fee.

69
00:03:18,103 --> 00:03:20,905
How is that any different
from indentured servitude?

70
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,974
Union Pacific offers
free rail passage

71
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,009
and a week's wages on arrival.

72
00:03:25,044 --> 00:03:26,711
We got more applicants
than we got work.

73
00:03:26,745 --> 00:03:28,346
Really?

74
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,082
Your idea again?

75
00:03:31,116 --> 00:03:35,853
Didn't much care for the labor
bosses I met in New York.

76
00:03:47,132 --> 00:03:48,432
New cemetery runs
from the sawmill

77
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:50,401
up to the Ridge line.

78
00:03:50,435 --> 00:03:52,169
Ain't a day goes by
we don't put some one or two

79
00:03:52,204 --> 00:03:56,941
in the ground up there,
most from railroad mishaps.

80
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:59,209
And the others?

81
00:03:59,244 --> 00:04:03,614
Spare time mishaps.

82
00:04:03,648 --> 00:04:08,452
Is that where the fair-haired
maiden of the west is buried?

83
00:04:11,556 --> 00:04:14,858
No, she's buried in
a wild flower field she liked.

84
00:04:14,893 --> 00:04:17,527
- Did you know her?
- A bit.

85
00:04:17,562 --> 00:04:18,962
Well, you must've known her
better than that

86
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:21,365
if you knew where she wanted
to be buried.

87
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,633
Mrs. Bell should've left
Hell On Wheels

88
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:24,534
when she had the chance.

89
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:26,970
This ain't no place for a lady,

90
00:04:27,004 --> 00:04:30,307
less'n she's a whore.

91
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:32,309
I can assure you,
Mr. Bohannon,

92
00:04:32,343 --> 00:04:35,045
I am neither a lady
nor a whore.

93
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,613
Figured you'd have to be
a little bit of both

94
00:04:36,647 --> 00:04:38,148
being a newspaper woman.

95
00:04:38,182 --> 00:04:40,050
Get outta here.

96
00:04:40,084 --> 00:04:42,385
Huh.

97
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,620
You figured wrong.

98
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:50,894
You Bohannon?

99
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:53,496
I am.

100
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,333
Keep your railroad
off my property.

101
00:04:57,368 --> 00:05:00,370
I won't tell you again.

102
00:05:08,045 --> 00:05:10,580
Where'd they come from?

103
00:05:10,614 --> 00:05:13,449
No idea.

104
00:05:13,484 --> 00:05:15,685
Train for Omaha leaves
in an hour.

105
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:18,721
I expect you won't
wanna miss it.

106
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,480

108

109
00:06:35,934 --> 00:06:38,068
Who are you?

110
00:06:38,103 --> 00:06:39,703
You come pawin' around
for turmoil,

111
00:06:39,738 --> 00:06:40,771
you best think twice, friend.

112
00:06:40,805 --> 00:06:43,207
This is my office.

113
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:45,609
Mr. Ferguson.

114
00:06:45,643 --> 00:06:48,178
Dick Barlow.
Just arrived from Omaha.

115
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:51,748
Didn't Mr. Bohannon tell you
to expect me?

116
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:54,751
No.

117
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:57,054
What you want in here?

118
00:06:57,088 --> 00:06:59,222
Well, I can tell by looking,
you ain't short a hat size,

119
00:06:59,257 --> 00:07:01,591
so I guess you know.

120
00:07:01,626 --> 00:07:04,261
I'm new Chief
of Railroad Police.

121
00:07:04,295 --> 00:07:08,031
You work for me now.

122
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:09,299
Coffee?

123
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,201
My grandpap taught me
how to make it.

124
00:07:11,235 --> 00:07:13,303
The trick is not to over-boil.

125
00:07:13,337 --> 00:07:17,073
And, of course, the sock.

126
00:07:17,108 --> 00:07:18,608
Now, uh, I use a clean one.

127
00:07:18,642 --> 00:07:21,611
But pap swore
the riper the sock,

128
00:07:21,645 --> 00:07:23,980
the richer the brew.

129
00:07:24,014 --> 00:07:27,217
I like a dollop of fresh cream
in mine,

130
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:30,220
but it ain't real regular
I come across it.

131
00:07:30,254 --> 00:07:34,557
And kicking don't get you
nowhere less'n you're a mule.

132
00:07:34,592 --> 00:07:38,661
So mostly,
I just take mine black.

133
00:07:38,696 --> 00:07:40,463
Mr. Bohannon
ain't said nothing

134
00:07:40,497 --> 00:07:44,067
about me working for nobody.

135
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:46,602
Well, it ain't no good cold now.

136
00:07:46,637 --> 00:07:49,639
Go on.

137
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:58,781
That's it.

138
00:07:58,815 --> 00:08:00,516
Mm.

139
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,918
That'll get your hair
out of the butter every time.

140
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:20,436
Don't want no trouble.

141
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,772
- Came to talk.
- What about?

142
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,508
Think you know.

143
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,688
Come ahead.

144
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:51,218
You survive the war?

145
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:55,570
- I did.
- You a Johnny Reb?

146
00:08:55,605 --> 00:08:58,840
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I was.

147
00:09:03,913 --> 00:09:05,580
So you know a little
about what it's like,

148
00:09:05,614 --> 00:09:09,217
somebody comes,
takes your land.

149
00:09:09,251 --> 00:09:12,887
Everything I had's been took.

150
00:09:12,922 --> 00:09:15,657
Indians killed my father
and my brother,

151
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:17,725
his wives and kids.

152
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,995
My wives and I,
we buried 'em on the same hill

153
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,432
I pulled our surveyor stakes
out of.

154
00:09:24,466 --> 00:09:26,667
My family bled for this land,
Mr. Bohannon,

155
00:09:26,702 --> 00:09:31,272
carved this place out
of a wilderness nobody wanted.

156
00:09:33,742 --> 00:09:36,577
It is
by Heavenly Father's decree

157
00:09:36,612 --> 00:09:39,914
that we are here,
and it shall be by His will,

158
00:09:39,948 --> 00:09:41,882
not yours, that we leave.

159
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:45,720
Even God can't stop
the railroad, Mr. Hatch.

160
00:09:48,623 --> 00:09:50,691
It would destroy all we built,

161
00:09:50,726 --> 00:09:53,761
take away our home.

162
00:09:53,795 --> 00:09:55,563
Mm.

163
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:57,932
You have my word.

164
00:09:57,966 --> 00:09:59,633
You'll get a square deal.

165
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:01,702
Now, now,
that's the best I can do.

166
00:10:01,736 --> 00:10:04,438
- Could go around.
- Boy.

167
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:06,807
Ain't nothin' but wilderness
and Lamonites out here, father.

168
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:09,176
I said that's enough.

169
00:10:21,356 --> 00:10:23,924
You will excuse
my son's manners.

170
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,928
He's got some growing
still to do.

171
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:43,843
Tell you what.
Um...

172
00:10:43,878 --> 00:10:46,513
Let me see if my surveyors
can't find a way around.

173
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:49,416
Now, that...
that's not a promise.

174
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,518
Ift can't be done,
you'll still have to move.

175
00:10:51,552 --> 00:10:56,656
But it don't cost nothing
to try.

176
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,263
Well, a journey
through these lands

177
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:06,966
at this hour is a foolish one,
Mr. Bohannon.

178
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,036
You are welcome to stay
till morning.

179
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,806
Much obliged.

180
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:21,735
Seen me a Mormon man
killed once.

181
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:24,237
Liberty, Missouri...

182
00:12:24,572 --> 00:12:26,406
During the war.

183
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,208
As if them white folk didn't
have enough to fight about,

184
00:12:29,243 --> 00:12:31,842
county sheriff run him through
with a sword

185
00:12:31,962 --> 00:12:33,479
on account of him
being a "Palgemist."

186
00:12:40,837 --> 00:12:44,452
Yep, they didn't like them
no "Palgemists"

187
00:12:44,572 --> 00:12:45,559
in Liberty, Missouri.

188
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,343
Like they Mormons
didn't like them no negroes.

189
00:12:51,848 --> 00:12:54,016
Yeah.
They a nasty bunch.

190
00:12:56,553 --> 00:12:58,988
I think
you mean "polygamist."

191
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:01,423
What'd I say?

192
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,859
"Palgemists."

193
00:13:03,893 --> 00:13:05,160
Well, I knew it was
something like that.

194
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:07,362
Why a man gotta get
hisself killed

195
00:13:07,397 --> 00:13:09,031
over being a polygamist?

196
00:13:09,065 --> 00:13:10,666
It's the custom
of having more than one wife

197
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,034
at the same time.

198
00:13:12,068 --> 00:13:13,969
More than one wife, you say?

199
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:15,937
At the same time?

200
00:13:15,972 --> 00:13:18,907
Well, damn.
No wonder they nasty.

201
00:13:24,647 --> 00:13:27,048
Sand, mud, lime.

202
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,384
Soil like that no good
for the grade, boss.

203
00:13:29,418 --> 00:13:32,387
Take a lot of lumber
to build it.

204
00:13:32,421 --> 00:13:34,322
Yeah, rock wall be better,
but that take time

205
00:13:34,357 --> 00:13:36,458
and rock, which we ain't got.

206
00:13:36,492 --> 00:13:38,993
I've surveyed several routes
through here, Mr. Bohannon.

207
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:41,796
Sand hills stretch at least
a hundred miles to the north.

208
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:43,531
We'd have to go South
to get around that farm.

209
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:45,800
- How far?
- 40 mile, maybe more.

210
00:13:45,835 --> 00:13:47,702
40 mile'll put us behind
schedule by five weeks.

211
00:13:47,736 --> 00:13:50,738
Yes, sir.

212
00:14:13,762 --> 00:14:15,663
I met the new police chief.

213
00:14:15,697 --> 00:14:21,335
You ain't happy,
track runs both ways.

214
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,108
Where's the livestock?
It's complicated.

215
00:14:28,143 --> 00:14:29,410
Tell you
what's complicated, son.

216
00:14:29,444 --> 00:14:31,779
3,000 hungry men.

217
00:14:31,813 --> 00:14:33,547
What I mean is

218
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,917
I've been on the job
for two days.

219
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:39,086
And deciphering these books
is quite the task.

220
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,088
Near as I can tell,

221
00:14:41,122 --> 00:14:42,956
Mr. Durant formed
several companies

222
00:14:42,991 --> 00:14:46,026
to supply livestock
to the railroad.

223
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,195
Now that he's departed,

224
00:14:48,229 --> 00:14:52,266
the contracts
have been canceled.

225
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,368
Then find some other
damn place, Sean.

226
00:14:54,402 --> 00:14:56,203
Council Bluffs, Denver,
shit, Chicago...

227
00:14:56,237 --> 00:15:00,140
I would, um, but it seems
that Mr. Durant has,

228
00:15:00,174 --> 00:15:02,809
in addition to canceling
our contracts

229
00:15:02,844 --> 00:15:04,744
with his companies,

230
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,241
cornered the market on livestock
in Omaha as well.

231
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:09,716
Shit!

232
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,618
Should've killed that son of
a bitch when I had the chance.

233
00:15:11,652 --> 00:15:14,788
May I quote you on that,
Mr. Bohannon?

234
00:15:18,693 --> 00:15:20,593
You don't say nothing to her
about railroad business.

235
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,496
- You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

236
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:27,233
- Still here?
- Missed my train.

237
00:15:27,268 --> 00:15:30,503
Don't say I didn't warn you.

238
00:15:37,277 --> 00:15:38,945
Oh.

239
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:42,081
We missed you at services
this morning, Mr. Bohannon.

240
00:15:45,285 --> 00:15:48,654
Was there something
I can help you with?

241
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:51,724
Thought I'd look in is all.

242
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,995
You gave us a good place...

243
00:15:56,029 --> 00:16:01,867
High, dry ground
upwind of the slaughterhouse.

244
00:16:01,902 --> 00:16:04,770
- Thank you.
- It's good.

245
00:16:04,805 --> 00:16:09,408
It's good for the men, I mean.

246
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:14,013
And you?

247
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:21,020
Oh.
Sorry.

248
00:16:21,054 --> 00:16:23,155
Uh...

249
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:26,158
Railroad has to move a family
of homesteaders off their land.

250
00:16:26,192 --> 00:16:30,495
They're digging in.
And, uh, they're Mormon.

251
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,830
I wonder if you've had
any cause to know

252
00:16:31,864 --> 00:16:35,033
what they might be like
as people.

253
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:36,735
The Latter Day Saints are not

254
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:39,571
a legitimate Church of Christ.

255
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:41,640
They treat their women
as slaves.

256
00:16:41,674 --> 00:16:43,642
They take child brides.

257
00:16:43,676 --> 00:16:45,310
They're a violent people.

258
00:16:45,344 --> 00:16:47,345
They'll fight then, you think?

259
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,981
It has been their way.
Yes.

260
00:16:50,016 --> 00:16:52,250
They got children with 'em.

261
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:54,219
Then you'll find another way.

262
00:16:54,253 --> 00:16:57,022
By God's Grace.

263
00:16:57,056 --> 00:17:01,993
God's been slack
with the Grace of late.

264
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:06,097
Then show them yours,
Mr. Bohannon.

265
00:17:10,636 --> 00:17:14,439
What I'm proposing is
a major new commercial hub,

266
00:17:14,473 --> 00:17:17,842
the most important railroad city
in the United States.

267
00:17:17,876 --> 00:17:23,448
And it will be right here
in your backyard.

268
00:17:23,482 --> 00:17:27,084
That is literally my backyard.

269
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,022
You see that pretty confluence
of good sweet-water streams?

270
00:17:31,056 --> 00:17:34,525
Well, it ain't much,
but it's on my land.

271
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,428
My husband left me all of this
when he passed in '62.

272
00:17:37,462 --> 00:17:40,131
Well, it may be
your land now, madam.

273
00:17:40,165 --> 00:17:42,199
But the Union Pacific Railroad

274
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:43,901
will reach it before the year
is out.

275
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,904
And, through eminent domain,
they will claim it.

276
00:17:46,938 --> 00:17:48,205
That's against the law.

277
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,373
It <i>is</i> the law.

278
00:17:49,407 --> 00:17:51,041
And by law,

279
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:53,377
the Union Pacific
is compelled to offer you

280
00:17:53,411 --> 00:17:55,446
a fair market price
for your land,

281
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,814
currently $1.50 an acre.

282
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,418
- I'd never sell for that.
- And you won't have to.

283
00:18:01,453 --> 00:18:03,287
Because as a representative

284
00:18:03,321 --> 00:18:06,423
and major stockholder
of Credit Mobilier,

285
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:10,160
I am prepared
to offer you $100 per acre,

286
00:18:10,195 --> 00:18:15,065
thus waiving eminent domain.

287
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:17,935
- What's the rub?
- Ah, well...

288
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:21,004
In order to waive
eminent domain,

289
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,174
we must build
a railroad terminus

290
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,009
and a town on the property,

291
00:18:26,043 --> 00:18:27,911
which we will.

292
00:18:27,945 --> 00:18:29,946
Every pound of beef,
every ton of ore,

293
00:18:29,981 --> 00:18:33,016
every fruit, vegetable,
every bale of hay

294
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,785
from either side
of the Mississippi

295
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,255
must ship through our town.

296
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:42,625
You will become rich
beyond your wildest dreams.

297
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,960
Weren't you in jail
just a month ago?

298
00:18:43,994 --> 00:18:45,528
- Yes.
- And you're broke,

299
00:18:45,563 --> 00:18:46,529
according to the newspapers.

300
00:18:46,564 --> 00:18:47,864
Flat broke.

301
00:18:47,898 --> 00:18:48,998
Well, how do you expect
to pay us

302
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:50,200
for our property then?

303
00:18:50,234 --> 00:18:52,669
From construction funds

304
00:18:52,703 --> 00:18:55,305
advanced to me
by the Union Pacific Railroad.

305
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:57,640
You were kicked off
Union Pacific for stealing.

306
00:18:57,675 --> 00:19:00,176
Union Pacific, Credit Mobilier,

307
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,479
different pockets
to the same pair of pants.

308
00:19:03,514 --> 00:19:06,048
When the judge understood that,
I was released.

309
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,984
You're in Omaha now, New York.

310
00:19:08,018 --> 00:19:09,552
Money won't buy you
judges here.

311
00:19:09,586 --> 00:19:13,689
Opportunity is a powerful
elixir, Mrs. Palmer.

312
00:19:13,724 --> 00:19:15,558
Right.

313
00:19:15,592 --> 00:19:18,494
So you're borrowing money
you don't have

314
00:19:18,528 --> 00:19:20,329
from a company
you don't work for

315
00:19:20,364 --> 00:19:21,997
to buy property
you can't afford

316
00:19:22,032 --> 00:19:23,966
to build a city
that doesn't exist.

317
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,367
Spearheading, as it were.

318
00:19:25,402 --> 00:19:28,404
A new way of doing business
in America.

319
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:37,980
If all difficulties were known

320
00:19:38,014 --> 00:19:40,983
at the outset of a long journey,
Mr. McGinnis,

321
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:45,020
few of us would ever
embark at all.

322
00:19:47,857 --> 00:19:50,692
A whiskey for my young friend.

323
00:19:54,964 --> 00:19:57,399
Have you got the money?

324
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,675
I'm very uneasy about this.

325
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:08,510
If Mr. Bohannon finds out...

326
00:20:08,544 --> 00:20:10,679
You are doing nothing wrong.

327
00:20:10,713 --> 00:20:12,881
You are managing
railroad funds,

328
00:20:12,915 --> 00:20:17,218
and you are managing them well.

329
00:20:17,253 --> 00:20:20,255
Have you got
something else for me?

330
00:20:25,127 --> 00:20:28,897
This is the, uh,
telegraph routing code

331
00:20:28,931 --> 00:20:31,766
for the Union Pacific.

332
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,568
You'll be able to eavesdrop

333
00:20:33,602 --> 00:20:36,104
on all of Mr. Bohannon's
business.

334
00:20:36,138 --> 00:20:38,773
Excellent.

335
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,215
Will you be paying
me today, Mr. Durant?

336
00:20:47,249 --> 00:20:51,586
All in due time,
Mr. McGinnis.

337
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:56,324
Oh, don't look so glum.

338
00:20:56,358 --> 00:21:01,462
My current situation
is but a temporary setback.

339
00:21:01,496 --> 00:21:05,266
History always sides
with a winner.

340
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:15,809
Where are you off to so fast?

341
00:21:15,844 --> 00:21:17,511
Excuse me, I'm...

342
00:21:17,545 --> 00:21:19,813
Um...

343
00:21:19,848 --> 00:21:21,582
Uh, stop, no.

344
00:21:21,616 --> 00:21:22,850
Ow, let me go.

345
00:21:22,884 --> 00:21:23,951
Give us a kiss first.

346
00:21:23,985 --> 00:21:25,686
What?

347
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:28,822
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Please, please.

348
00:21:28,857 --> 00:21:31,858
Not like this.
Let's go to my room, huh?

349
00:21:33,861 --> 00:21:36,663
I got us a bottle we can share.

350
00:21:36,698 --> 00:21:40,200
Touch me again,
it'll be your throat!

351
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:46,206
Bloody whore.

352
00:21:55,804 --> 00:21:57,272
My grandpap,

353
00:21:57,306 --> 00:21:58,973
a dough puncher from way back,

354
00:21:59,008 --> 00:22:01,943
taught me surest way
to a woman's heart

355
00:22:01,977 --> 00:22:03,611
by way of her stomach.

356
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:08,883
By God, if that wasn't
certain with my Tess.

357
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:12,453
You married, Mr. Ferguson?

358
00:22:12,487 --> 00:22:14,956
Some could call it that.

359
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,991
Kids?

360
00:22:17,025 --> 00:22:18,893
Got me a new baby girl.

361
00:22:18,927 --> 00:22:21,629
Nothing like a new baby to
make a man count his blessings

362
00:22:21,663 --> 00:22:23,097
and keep them close.

363
00:22:23,131 --> 00:22:27,082
I got five youngsters,
all girls,

364
00:22:27,202 --> 00:22:28,090
if you want to know.

365
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:32,139
The oldest one's
12 going on 40.

366
00:22:32,174 --> 00:22:36,310
That little girl of mine,
she beautiful.

367
00:22:36,344 --> 00:22:40,280
I look in her eyes,
and she melt my heart.

368
00:22:40,315 --> 00:22:45,686
But her mama afraid this job
gonna get me killed.

369
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,389
She think that baby ain't gonna
have no daddy to bring her up.

370
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:55,362
How's the coffee?

371
00:22:55,396 --> 00:22:57,864
It's better the second day.

372
00:22:57,899 --> 00:22:59,833
It's the sock.

373
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:02,335
Need you boys to ride out
and tell them homesteaders

374
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,870
there's no way around the land.

375
00:23:03,905 --> 00:23:05,705
This here's the writ
of eminent domain.

376
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,307
Let them know the government
pays $1.50 an acre.

377
00:23:07,341 --> 00:23:09,876
Railroad will throw in
another dollar.

378
00:23:09,911 --> 00:23:11,845
Let 'em know that's more
than fair, all right?

379
00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:13,013
Yes, sir.

380
00:23:13,047 --> 00:23:15,615
Oh, you do the talking.

381
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,219
Mormons ain't keen on negroes.

382
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,191
Finish your coffee,
Mr. Ferguson.

383
00:23:25,226 --> 00:23:27,627
I got to visit the necessary.

384
00:23:27,661 --> 00:23:29,762
Then we'll be on our way.

385
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:34,867
They said
he was a hell-raiser,

386
00:23:34,902 --> 00:23:39,038
but my pap was a lazy son of
a bitch by the time I knew him.

387
00:23:39,073 --> 00:23:41,541
Fact, one time
when I was, oh, nine...

388
00:23:41,575 --> 00:23:43,376
Don't you ever stop talking?

389
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,812
No, sir, I do not.

390
00:23:45,846 --> 00:23:49,048
Out here, a quiet man is twice
as likely as a noisy one

391
00:23:49,082 --> 00:23:52,151
to have his beard clung to
by a bear.

392
00:23:52,185 --> 00:23:55,888
I intend to keep my scalp.

393
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:00,660
Maybe they're gone.

394
00:24:00,694 --> 00:24:02,828
No, they ain't gone.

395
00:24:02,863 --> 00:24:05,731
Horses still in the barn.

396
00:24:19,579 --> 00:24:21,380
Keep your gun close.

397
00:24:21,414 --> 00:24:22,781
You see our cinch
getting frayed,

398
00:24:22,816 --> 00:24:25,484
start shooting.

399
00:24:33,459 --> 00:24:35,594
Hello!

400
00:24:35,628 --> 00:24:38,130
Anybody home?

401
00:24:42,735 --> 00:24:44,136
Mr. Hatch?

402
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,443
State your business!

403
00:24:51,477 --> 00:24:54,145
I'm Dick Barlow,
Chief of Police,

404
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,781
Union Pacific Railroad.

405
00:24:59,285 --> 00:25:01,987
Think you know why we're here.

406
00:25:02,021 --> 00:25:05,323
I already told the other one,
we ain't leaving.

407
00:25:08,327 --> 00:25:10,435
You ain't got any choice.

408
00:25:10,555 --> 00:25:11,963
That's what
we come to tell you.

409
00:25:11,997 --> 00:25:14,632
We ain't afraid to fight
for what's ours.

410
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:18,136
You best leave
on out of here now.

411
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:21,673
Threatening us
ain't gonna get us no...

412
00:25:21,707 --> 00:25:23,474
Barlow!

413
00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:24,709
What

414
00:25:57,142 --> 00:25:58,642
I need 75,000 ties

415
00:25:58,676 --> 00:26:00,410
delivered 25 miles
beyond the end of the rails

416
00:26:00,445 --> 00:26:01,778
before the first of the month,

417
00:26:02,015 --> 00:26:03,213
a hundred barrels
of blasting powder.

418
00:26:03,248 --> 00:26:04,948
Make sure we got enough
wranglers to tend them cattle

419
00:26:04,983 --> 00:26:08,218
when they get here...

420
00:26:08,253 --> 00:26:09,686
from Denver.

421
00:26:09,721 --> 00:26:12,089
Eva!

422
00:26:15,927 --> 00:26:17,794
What happened?

423
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:19,296
The Mormons shot him.

424
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,297
Shit.

425
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:21,665
Careful, careful.

426
00:26:21,699 --> 00:26:22,866
I got his legs.

427
00:26:24,869 --> 00:26:26,236
Eva!

428
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,672
Eva, we need you!

429
00:26:28,706 --> 00:26:30,507
Elam, the baby!

430
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:33,343
You're the closest thing
we got to a doctor.

431
00:26:55,733 --> 00:26:57,166
Go get me some onion broth.

432
00:26:57,201 --> 00:26:58,735
You!

433
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:00,570
Go to the hotel restaurant,

434
00:27:00,604 --> 00:27:02,605
get me some onion broth now.
Go!

435
00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:03,773
Was it the old man or the boy?

436
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:05,541
I don't know for certain.

437
00:27:05,576 --> 00:27:08,111
- Certain you don't know.
- Told you I don't know.

438
00:27:08,145 --> 00:27:09,345
Well, I know for certain
there's a man lying here

439
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:10,746
with a bullet in him.

440
00:27:10,781 --> 00:27:11,747
I just told you
I ain't seen him.

441
00:27:11,782 --> 00:27:14,250
Will you two stop it?

442
00:27:14,284 --> 00:27:15,451
Shut that baby up.

443
00:27:15,485 --> 00:27:18,254
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

444
00:27:18,288 --> 00:27:19,622
Here.

445
00:27:19,656 --> 00:27:21,557
Prop him up.

446
00:27:21,591 --> 00:27:22,958
Get him up.

447
00:27:25,462 --> 00:27:27,730
Drink the medicine.

448
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:42,978
Yeah, I can smell the onion
broth through the wound.

449
00:27:43,013 --> 00:27:44,613
He's gut-shot, Elam.

450
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:46,815
He ain't gonna make it.

451
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:50,886
Take that damn baby outside.

452
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,155
No, wait.

453
00:27:53,189 --> 00:27:57,125
Bring her here.

454
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,429
Bring her over here.
Please.

455
00:28:00,463 --> 00:28:02,564
Let me see her.

456
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:05,333
Please let me see her.

457
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:12,974
Oh.

458
00:28:18,147 --> 00:28:23,118
She's beautiful,
Mr. Ferguson.

459
00:28:23,152 --> 00:28:25,987
Just like you said.

460
00:28:56,752 --> 00:28:59,820
You wanted it.

461
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,567
Not like this.

462
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:12,766
Well?

463
00:29:24,212 --> 00:29:26,313
All right.
Telegraph the fort.

464
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,382
Tell the major we need help
evicting them homesteaders.

465
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,053
You want a railroad story?

466
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:35,722
Follow me.

467
00:30:15,784 --> 00:30:18,386
Mr. Hatch!

468
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:23,024
This is Cullen Bohannon of
the Union Pacific Railroad.

469
00:30:23,058 --> 00:30:25,393
I have a writ of execution here

470
00:30:25,427 --> 00:30:28,863
for the killing of
my Chief of Police.

471
00:30:28,897 --> 00:30:31,732
Come on out.

472
00:30:36,571 --> 00:30:39,273
You don't, and these soldiers
will burn you out.

473
00:30:39,307 --> 00:30:40,741
I won't be able to stop them.

474
00:30:44,613 --> 00:30:47,481
You got one minute,
Mr. Hatch.

475
00:31:07,402 --> 00:31:11,872
United States Cavalry
was not built for waiting.

476
00:31:11,906 --> 00:31:14,941
We didn't come here
to kill women and children.

477
00:31:14,976 --> 00:31:18,445
A disorganized brain
is lacking in moral principles.

478
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:20,447
Are you aware of that,
Bohannon?

479
00:31:20,481 --> 00:31:22,115
Not something I ponder nights.

480
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:23,917
Moral principles are
the first line of defense

481
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:26,486
against criminal behavior.

482
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,888
You learn
something new every day.

483
00:31:28,923 --> 00:31:30,490
Without moral principles,

484
00:31:30,524 --> 00:31:32,559
these Mormons will inevitably
turn to violence

485
00:31:32,593 --> 00:31:36,162
to solve their problems,
just like the heathens.

486
00:31:36,197 --> 00:31:39,332
Am I right about that, chief?

487
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:41,668
What he talking about?

488
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,989
Y'all keep your barrels down.

489
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,267
You and your boys
put your guns down.

490
00:32:15,302 --> 00:32:18,204
I told you,
stay off my property

491
00:32:18,238 --> 00:32:20,339
or there'll be hell to pay.

492
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:22,041
And I told you if I couldn't
find a way around,

493
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:24,009
the U.S. Government would
rightfully claim its land.

494
00:32:26,713 --> 00:32:29,848
You murdered
my Chief of Police.

495
00:32:29,883 --> 00:32:32,051
He was trespassing.
He was warned.

496
00:32:32,085 --> 00:32:34,119
You have to stand accountable.

497
00:32:34,154 --> 00:32:37,156
I am the priesthood holder
of my family, Mr. Bohannon.

498
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:41,393
Without me,
they will not survive.

499
00:32:41,428 --> 00:32:42,795
You should've thought
about that

500
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:44,630
before you pulled that trigger.

501
00:32:44,664 --> 00:32:47,199
They won't survive.

502
00:32:48,668 --> 00:32:50,035
I'll see to it they get to

503
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:51,670
the Mormon settlement
at Fort Smith.

504
00:32:51,704 --> 00:32:53,505
How's that?

505
00:33:45,224 --> 00:33:47,625
- He done it.
- Father?

506
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:04,108
Did you kill that man, son?

507
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,342
Tell me the truth now.

508
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:24,161
Yes, sir.

509
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:28,365
Mr. Ferguson,
this boy shoot Dick Barlow?

510
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,602
I ain't sure.

511
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:39,843
Good God, man, get on with it.

512
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,179
You'd have me hang him?

513
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,980
It's the law, Bohannon.

514
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,349
You said so yourself, and you
are obliged to uphold it.

515
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:50,253
We do not make exceptions
to the law out here.

516
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,322
You realize he'll hang.

517
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:55,659
He's just a boy.

518
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,026
You're gonna tell me the truth.

519
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:58,294
I told you the truth!

520
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,697
Son, you got a different story,

521
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:03,166
you best tell me right now.

522
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:10,907
He's just a boy.

523
00:35:18,982 --> 00:35:21,384
Not today he ain't.

524
00:35:21,418 --> 00:35:23,186
All right.

525
00:35:27,524 --> 00:35:29,559
Father.

526
00:35:29,593 --> 00:35:31,294
Come here.

527
00:35:31,328 --> 00:35:33,796
- Father!
- Come on, boy.

528
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,766
- Come on.
- Easy.

529
00:35:39,102 --> 00:35:41,704
Father!

530
00:35:41,738 --> 00:35:43,405
Father!

531
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,840
Sorry, son.

532
00:36:29,847 --> 00:36:33,382
"Life on the prairie is
not worth the powder it takes

533
00:36:33,417 --> 00:36:36,419
to blow it all to hell."

534
00:36:43,177 --> 00:36:44,811
So say the denizens
of Hell On Wheels,

535
00:36:44,845 --> 00:36:47,180
the rollicking tent city

536
00:36:47,214 --> 00:36:49,849
that moves with
the transcontinental railroad

537
00:36:49,883 --> 00:36:51,551
as it creeps across the country

538
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:54,553
at a pace of two miles per day.

539
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:56,689
It is no place
for women or children,

540
00:36:56,723 --> 00:36:58,357
as the men who labor here,

541
00:36:58,392 --> 00:37:01,193
veterans of the recent conflict,
immigrants,

542
00:37:01,228 --> 00:37:02,761
and free negroes,

543
00:37:02,796 --> 00:37:05,397
often take to drink
and un-Christian pursuits

544
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:08,734
when not swinging a hammer
or laying track.

545
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:12,104
Every man here carries a gun,

546
00:37:12,138 --> 00:37:15,374
which can be had for
as little as $3,

547
00:37:15,408 --> 00:37:18,944
and a knife,
and goes to church on Sunday.

548
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,720
Here you can buy a meal for 35¢

549
00:37:28,755 --> 00:37:30,956
a beer for less than a quarter,

550
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:35,027
a suit of clothes for $5
that includes a hat.

551
00:37:35,061 --> 00:37:38,096
The belongings of the dead
are cheaper than that.

552
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:40,999
Any last words, son?

553
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:46,938
I came here to meet the man
who replaced "Doc" Durant

554
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:50,609
as Chief Engineer of
the Union Pacific Railroad.

555
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:55,747
I can tell you he is a man
for whom honor is sacred

556
00:37:55,781 --> 00:37:59,751
and virtue impermanent.

557
00:38:03,255 --> 00:38:06,257
In the brave new wilderness
he calls home,

558
00:38:06,292 --> 00:38:09,294
integrity is important
to Cullen Bohannon.

559
00:40:25,295 --> 00:40:27,563
Whether a man of integrity
is what's needed

560
00:40:27,597 --> 00:40:31,300
to build the railroad,
we don't yet know.

561
00:40:31,334 --> 00:40:33,869
The railroad has always
been the business

562
00:40:33,904 --> 00:40:36,171
of the unscrupulous
and corrupt.

563
00:40:46,483 --> 00:40:48,784
You owe me a life

564
00:40:48,818 --> 00:40:51,153
for the one
you took from me today.

565
00:40:59,996 --> 00:41:03,665
I suspect our new Chief
Engineer to be neither.

566
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:21,850
And for that, dear reader,

567
00:41:21,884 --> 00:41:24,786
we might all
count our blessings...

568
00:41:31,827 --> 00:41:34,329
and say a prayer.

569
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:51,170
