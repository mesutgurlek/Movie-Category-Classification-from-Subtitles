1
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,524
- Buenas noches, patrón.
- Good evening.

2
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,604
Gracias.

3
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:37,021
So it's you.

4
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:39,683
I might have known.

5
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:43,694
I might have known no one but you would
have bone enough to come into her room here.

6
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:47,960
I neglected to order a gown for your wedding.
I'm trying to make one of hers do.

7
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:52,766
I think a sister should favor her brother's
wedding with her best appearance, don't you?

8
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,204
I don't think T.C. Will like this, Vance.

9
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:59,369
You know he's been particular about
keeping her room same as before she died.

10
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,371
Mother had everything.

11
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:07,010
Calling cards for a woman whose
next-door neighbor was miles off.

12
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,021
Jewels for a woman who never
looked at herself in the mirror.

13
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:13,354
Sunshades for a woman
who never left this room.

14
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,359
You understood her.
I never did.

15
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,861
No, you never did.

16
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,228
I'm only surprised he hasn't
hung a sign on this.

17
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,927
"Beth. Wifely property ofT.C. Jeffords."

18
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,767
And you're T.C.'s son,
and he despises anything he can beat.

19
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,240
I never let him beat me.
Why do you always let him get the best of you?

20
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:34,109
Isn't it writ in the Scripture?
"Honor thy father."

21
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,308
Always laughing at me inside you,
aren't you, Clay?

22
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,251
Not always.

23
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,117
Why do you suppose T.C. Is coming back
from San Francisco?

24
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,657
- Why, for my wedding, of course.
- Ha!

25
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:49,387
I know. T.C. Wouldn't
walk across the street to my wedding.

26
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,794
- Then why is he coming back?
- I think he needs money.

27
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,163
T.C.? Oh, you must be moon-hit.

28
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:58,294
Why, he's one of the richest men
in the territory- in the whole country.

29
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,771
Cattle-rich. Land-rich.
I make it he's money-poor right now.

30
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,900
And I make it that's why
he's had Scotty taking tally.

31
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,377
And that's why
he's spreading these I.O.U.s.

32
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,380
Oh, they're easy to spread.

33
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,450
Less easy to pay off.

34
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,792
T.C.!

35
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,091
¡Patrón.! ¡Patrón.!
Welcome home.

36
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,397
Had a hankerir to bed down
in my own tepee tonight.

37
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:34,268
Got the railroad to flag me
right through to The Furies.

38
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,645
You were in her room.

39
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,942
That's right.

40
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,151
Her gown befiits you.

41
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,126
Father.

42
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:58,322
Son, you make "Father" sound
just like "son of a she-fox."

43
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,991
Daughter, Son, meet Reynolds here.

44
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,261
Reynolds from
Old Anaheim's Bank in San Francisco.

45
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:06,167
Reynolds, meet my household.

46
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,172
Scratch my sixth lumbar vertebra.

47
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,334
This here is Scotty Hyslip.
Scotty keeps my accounts.

48
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:14,277
The man who made all those bear raids
on the Huron Railroad stock...

49
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,314
and then took to swindlir
on the sound theory...

50
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:20,045
that the things folks want most in life
is to get something for nothing.

51
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,145
Oh, souvenir. The time I met up
with a party of Osages...

52
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,588
and got an arrow
in my sixth lumbar vertebra.

53
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:30,755
The scar vexes me now and then and takes
kindly to scratchir.

54
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:33,024
This be El Tigre!

55
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,032
The Tiger.

56
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:37,602
- My ranch boss.
- Senor.

57
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:41,936
El Tigre won victory after victory, for his
love of his people was known to his people.

58
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,236
Then he hung a man.
And it was justly.

59
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,472
He was so taken with the dance on the air
he begun hanging his people.

60
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,708
And unjustly.
His people took just so many hangings.

61
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:55,519
You tell Old Anaheim I got only the best
working The Furies for me.

62
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:59,648
Marcel, my cook there, once dished up a mess
Napoléon would give him a blue ribbon for.

63
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,057
And when I gifted my deceased wife...

64
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:04,857
with a portrait of myself, I -

65
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,500
Pretty good, huh?

66
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,604
Chiquita.

67
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:17,870
- There's dust on me.
- Sí, patrón. But I did not expect you until tomorrow.

68
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:21,469
Cook here will rustle up a fiine mess
for an hour from now.

69
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:27,318
Ah, vamoose, the rest of ya.
I got a hankering to be with my kin. Vamoose!

70
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,388
Vamoose!

71
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,496
- T.C., you talk too much.
- So I do, and so I will...

72
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,498
till I meet up with talk better than mine.

73
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,500
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

74
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:45,503
- The necklace you said you'd bring back.
- Clay, you got a mess of good manners.

75
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,937
You ought to feed your sister
some of'em.

76
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,770
Well, here's what you been
"peskying" me about.

77
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:58,210
Pearls. Fit for dull, dove-faced little women.
I told you, anything but pearls.

78
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,884
You didn't dare come back
without it, did you?

79
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,893
I'd bed down with a rattlesnake fiirst.

80
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,901
Like it, Daughter?

81
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,869
So did I.

82
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,132
It'll match her earrings.

83
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,698
Well, I'll go up to my room now.

84
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,043
For your bride.

85
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,207
My deepest gratitude, Father.

86
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,691
An hour in the room whenever
he comes back to The Furies...

87
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,288
an hour whenever he leaves.

88
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:49,595
And yet when she was dying
and sent for him, he wouldn't come.

89
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:53,001
He couldn't stand to see anything
that belonged to him slip away from him.

90
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,699
I like being T.C.'s daughter.

91
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,677
Yes, princess,
heiress apparent to The Furies.

92
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,762
Good water and graze here.

93
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,855
Anaheim picked himself
a smart appraiser.

94
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,025
This is the Darrow Strip,
best part ofThe Furies.

95
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,864
Darrow's son -
he is come back to the town.

96
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,269
I thought I'd seen me
the last piece of Darrow hide.

97
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,739
If you permit, patrón,
leave this piece to me, eh?

98
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,310
I permit.
Come on.

99
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,781
- What's that?
- Sounds like a calf bawlir.

100
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,918
- Where do you make it?
- There. Down the draw.

101
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,516
Be a lesson to him
not to get himself stuck in the mud.

102
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:14,245
He didn't get stuck.
He's been stuck. It's a squatter's trick.

103
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,378
They mire a calf
and then come for him later.

104
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,947
- No, no. You'll choke him. I'll get him.
- You'll do what?

105
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,459
- You heard me.

106
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,732
- Many squatters here on The Furies?
- Some.

107
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:32,270
The people in the pueblecitos -
the little villages - they matter not...

108
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,271
but back in the hills there are others.

109
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,637
You're paid to make sure
the squatters don't rob us.

110
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,711
- Next time earn your pay.

111
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,980
Quite a friendship
between you and Miss Vance.

112
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,280
Women were created so that man
might enjoy his food and sleep...

113
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,286
not to give orders.

114
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:52,414
All right now!

115
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,289
Come on.! Now take it easy.

116
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,157
I'm trying to lend you a hand!

117
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,122
- Patrón.

118
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,224
Ha! Did it!

119
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,600
Didrt think the old man had it in him,
did ya?

120
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,435
Didn't think I could do it.

121
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,508
Ah, you grinnir ranahans!
Throw me a rope.

122
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,517
It must be a calf.
It looks like a man, but it can't be.

123
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,349
Only a brainless calf would
get himself stuck in the mud.

124
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,482
T.C., you come out of there.
You're too old to play at mud-pies.

125
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:39,195
No, muchachos.

126
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,969
What are they saying?

127
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,412
That never will they have
a fiiner chance to kill the patrón.

128
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,417
Never will they fiind him
with fewer men to help him.

129
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,249
Juanito -

130
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:59,347
¡Sí, Juanito.!

131
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:08,032
There is to be no trouble while she is here.

132
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,034
No guns.

133
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,104
That goes for you too.

134
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,033
You stashed my calf away here!

135
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,772
- Yeah.
- I told you before.

136
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,814
SenorJeffords...

137
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,440
it has always been our right on the land -

138
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,281
the right of we, the Herreras,
and those of the pueblecitos...

139
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:31,447
for as many years back
as you have hairs on your head!

140
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:34,458
Stop stealing cattle from The Furies!

141
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,121
I told you once, I tell you now.
I'll not tell you again.

142
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:51,341
At least he riled you enough
so you walked yourself out of the mud.

143
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,844
- For a fact!
- I tell you, if the devil riled you enough...

144
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,073
you'll walk yourself
right out of the fiires of hell.

145
00:11:56,182 --> 00:12:00,312
- I give you my word, if I do, Daughter,
I'll take you right out of there with me.

146
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:10,027
Rightly speakir, it's no concern of yourn, but
I think it only fiit and proper you be a party to it.

147
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:14,828
Reynolds here representing Anaheim's Bank
has loaned me $100,000 on The Furies.

148
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,198
- That's right.
- Speak when you're spoken to.

149
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,075
- You favor my Napoléon, huh?
- It's a fiine work.

150
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,667
He was a great one.

151
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,873
Started from scratch
to build hisself an empire.

152
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,318
Hey, how do you like me?

153
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,787
Well, no matter. No matter.

154
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,052
- About the matter of the cloud on title -
- The what?

155
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,720
The squatters constitute a cloud
on the title ofThe Furies.

156
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:46,161
As a condition of making the loan,
the Anaheim Bank...

157
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,529
will require the removal
of the squatters from the premises.

158
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,795
Pure legal mulch, Daughter.
It only means the squatters...

159
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,337
gotta be booted offThe Furies,
and so we gotta start bootir.

160
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,907
- No, you don't. Not the Herreras.
- You tellir me what to do?

161
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,533
- The pueblecitos, all right, but the Herreras stay.
- Mind your tongue.

162
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:01,670
I want your word on that, T.C.
That's one thing I want your word on.

163
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,579
Can't I never get the best of you? Never?

164
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,583
- Never.

165
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:10,143
Ah, you're a she-fox.
You got The Furies in you, all right.

166
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,554
You have my word on the Herreras.

167
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:15,286
Sign the mortgage.
It's fiit and proper.

168
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,533
- May I read it fiirst?
- Sign it.

169
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,604
Certainly, Father.

170
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,832
I suppose you'll use part of the money
to pay off some of your T.C.s.

171
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,035
- Why, you muleheaded, bone-eared -
- To pay off what?

172
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,840
What are these T.C. S
which are to be paid off?

173
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,979
Well, you see, uh, the folks hereabouts
don't get to see much hard money...

174
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,645
so I had these got up
for 'em to use for money.

175
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:46,156
My word's behind 'em,
and my word's enough for the folks.

176
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,158
Call 'em T.C.s.

177
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,421
Folks should like 'em, too,
and why not?

178
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,225
I give 'em better paper
than they use in Washington.

179
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,460
And my motto is
amicus humani generis -

180
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,469
"friend of the human race" -

181
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,062
which is six more letters of Latin
than e pluribus unum.

182
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:05,041
And to boot I give 'em art.

183
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,942
Picture of a lulu of a girl riding a bull.

184
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,015
Fine fiigure, ain't she?

185
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:14,017
How many of these I.O.U. S of yours
are still outstanding?

186
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,383
- How much do you owe?
- Piddlir amount. Piddlir amount.

187
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,388
Makes a complication.

188
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,288
I'd better bring this situation
to Mr. Anaheim's attention.

189
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,691
Get out.
You and bobtail talk ofT.C.s.

190
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,094
- If I've inconvenienced you -
- Get out!

191
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,894
Good night, Father.

192
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:35,268
So you, uh, say you'll have to
see Old Anaheim.

193
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:41,143
That's fiine. You trek on back to San Francisco
and palaver it out with the old red-eye.

194
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,714
Of course, you understand.

195
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,715
I understand.

196
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:48,014
Yeah. Duty- and honor-bound and such.

197
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,452
Yeah. Matter of fact,
I'll trek back with ya.

198
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,820
That'll be fiine, sir.

199
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,723
Matter of fact,
I'll take Chiquita along.

200
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,854
- What?
- They say travel's improving.

201
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:03,628
Uh, Mrs. Reynolds, your wife, might get
a real pleasure out of, uh, meeting Chiquita.

202
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,136
Uh, might help to improve
Chiquita considerable.

203
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:17,038
In view of the small amount
outstanding, I -

204
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:21,609
I don't think it'll be necessary
to mention the T.C. S to Mr. Anaheim.

205
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,679
Reynolds, it's always a real pleasure
to do business with a gentleman.

206
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,391
Uh, there'll be a conveyance for you
at the railroad at sunup.

207
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,035
Ah, that Clay.

208
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,037
He's always laughing at us, isn't he?

209
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,973
Clay's marryir Carol Ann Weadick.
She'll bring him Bar Double X when her pa dies.

210
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:47,705
Ah, it's lucky for Clay,
'cause I'll give him no part ofThe Furies.

211
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,873
- And that takes care of Clay.
- For a fact.

212
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:54,680
And I got to admit I'm none too catty
at runnir The Furies myself.

213
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,756
Oh, I know I was good
at puttir it together.

214
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:01,087
Startir from scratch, hookir one piece
of land onto another, but...

215
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,684
this money talk with puny moneymen.

216
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,698
- Runnir The Furies ain't for me.
- Which takes care of you.

217
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:11,566
- Which leaves who to run The Furies?
- Which leaves me.

218
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,570
Can you run it?

219
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:17,108
Wouldrt speak well for me if I couldn't.
It's what you've trained me for, isn't it?

220
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:22,445
- Only one thing can waddle it up.
- What's that?

221
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:26,075
- The man you take to husband.
- My husband will be my choice, not yours.

222
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,519
Maybe so. Maybe no.

223
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,955
See here. Here's half the money I got
from Anaheim's Bank- $50,000.

224
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:38,496
- Good sum.
- It's yours for a dowry if you pick a man I could favor.

225
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:41,430
One I could sit down to table with
and not dislodge my chow.

226
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,593
You sound like you'd rather I never married.

227
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:47,263
You won't have it easy fiindir a man.

228
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,841
I've spoiled most of'em for ya.

229
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:53,378
You'd want a man like me, who'd
knuckle under to no one - least of all you.

230
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:58,647
You think you're top man
on God's green earth, don't you?

231
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,151
- You know anyone better?
- No, but I'll keep looking...

232
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:05,587
and when I fiind him, I'll marry him,
and I won't care if it does put you off your feed.

233
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,962
- "Burnett."
- I'll take that.

234
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,236
Who's Burnett?

235
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,101
No matter.

236
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,518
A man gets lonely, Daughter.

237
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,418
I'll ask no more questions.

238
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,554
Scratch my sixth lumbar vertebra.

239
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,123
Come on, slue-foot!

240
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,268
- Beat you here again.

241
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,276
Ah, it's been a long time
since we raced here.

242
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,611
I always did get here fiirst, didn't I?

243
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,982
You always did get here fiirst, didn't you?

244
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,853
Juan Herrera, you let me win.
You always did - every time.

245
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,052
The one time I didn't let you...

246
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,095
- you scratched blood.

247
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,494
It's The Furies brand on you, all right.

248
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:58,059
No, Vance.
Not The Furies.

249
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,138
- Yours.
- No difference.

250
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,531
No?

251
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,373
What is it, Juan?
You've been on touch all day.

252
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,819
Look.

253
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,981
Wherever you see,
as far as you can see, it is The Furies.

254
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,991
Your father's.

255
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,687
He has space for thousands of cattle...

256
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,695
for hundreds of horses.

257
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,697
But has he space for a few Herreras?

258
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,131
It's his land. He can have on it
whoever he wants.

259
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:33,102
If he doesn't want you Herreras on it,
that's his say-so.

260
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,435
I was afraid that someday
you were going to say that.

261
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,509
All right. I've said it.

262
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,307
I don't take to anyone
talking like that about T.C.

263
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:48,045
I don't take to it. Even if we did grow up
together. Even if you are my friend.

264
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:50,417
One I can talk to.
One who understands.

265
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,118
And I don't take to your going.

266
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,634
Till our eyes next meet.

267
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,706
Till then.

268
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,653
Time?

269
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,296
The kiss of a good friend.

270
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,832
- ¡Hasta luego!
- Hasta luego.

271
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,664
It wasrt there.

272
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,826
Congratulations, Carol Ann.

273
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:47,200
- Fair the bride and happy the day.
- Oh, thank you, Dr. Grieve.

274
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,682
Evening.

275
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,850
Well, gentlemen, do I or don't I?

276
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:03,853
Am I yanked by my boots
or pulled by the hair of my head?

277
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,155
He's here on The Furies?
Gentlemen, I don't. Deal me out.

278
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:12,053
Mr. Darrow.

279
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,655
Mr. Jeffords, sir.
My honor and pleasure.

280
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,666
That's far enough.

281
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:20,864
I'll have no grit-eatir blackleg gambler
on The Furies, and I'll have no son of a Darrow.

282
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:24,635
Well, talk like that, sir, must be meant
as a joke. I'll be pleased to ignore it.

283
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,974
Ignore what you like, but drag your belly
out of here. You taint the place.

284
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,173
- Sir, you posted an open invitation...

285
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,546
to this gathering
on every stick of lumber in the country.

286
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:36,246
To protect those present
from any further unpleasantness...

287
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,585
I'd like to make a deal with you.

288
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,217
You stop telling lies about me,
and I'll stop telling the truth about you.

289
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:45,785
- I heard that before. Now get!

290
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:49,560
I killed your father in a fair fiight,
and I'd be pleased to do as much for you.

291
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:53,036
Mr. Darrow, sir...

292
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,197
this is our dance, I believe, sir.

293
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,488
Why did you come here?

294
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,751
I'm interested in the Darrow Strip.

295
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:51,027
What do they call you?

296
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:54,758
Some call me a grit-eatir blackleg gambler.
I run the Legal Tender.

297
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:58,393
Some call me Mr. Darrow,
and some call me Rip.

298
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:01,028
Rip. Fits you.

299
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,369
Like a blade cutting right through.

300
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:08,141
This wasrt our dance, Miss Jeffords,
and you didn't invite me here.

301
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:13,675
- Why did you let on you did?
- If I had ever seen you, I would have invited you.

302
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,753
I'm sure you would have.

303
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:18,379
- Modest, aren't you?
- No.

304
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:23,791
You think you're top man
on God's green earth, don't you?

305
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:27,991
I'm a gambler.
When I'm losing, I cut my bets to the minimum.

306
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,033
When I'm winning...

307
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,103
I let it ride.

308
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:37,097
Patrón, the food is ready.

309
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,473
- The bean is on, the coffee's boiling.

310
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:48,485
For them that don't like beans, there are
150 various other vittles. So dig to it.

311
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,382
- I'm not hungry.
- Nor am I.

312
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,459
My rig is outside.

313
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,296
How very convenient.

314
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:19,241
Do you think I'll be cold?

315
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,213
Do you mind if I take the reins?

316
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:27,382
I like to know where I'm going.

317
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,460
I think I can trust you.

318
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,640
No, no. It'll do without that.

319
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:45,767
She's smart enough to see through him.

320
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:51,315
He'll hang himself. That'll be a different twist
of the rope for you to enjoy, eh, Tigre?

321
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,841
This is a nice romantic spot.

322
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:25,007
That depends on who you're with.

323
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,277
I know this place.

324
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:30,252
- This is part of the Darrow Strip, isn't it?
- It is.

325
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:34,257
I thought you'd be more comfortable
if the surroundings were familiar.

326
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:38,728
Do you always go after what you're after
as directly as this?

327
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,822
When you know what you want,
why waste time?

328
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:06,549
Or perhaps you'd prefer
polite conversation.

329
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:10,617
Speaking of the weather, Miss Jeffords,
it is a fiine, brisk evening.

330
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,959
So it is.

331
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,965
- That ends the polite conversation.
- Mr. Darrow, sir.

332
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:21,164
May I expect the honor of your call
at The Furies on Saturday?

333
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,604
I take it you'll bake a cake.

334
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,142
Isn't that the way
the courting is done hereabouts?

335
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:30,510
I've never baked a cake before,
but I'll... bake one.

336
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:36,843
If I were to come courting you, your father
would send his army from The Furies.

337
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:39,515
He'd wreck the Legal Tender,
and he'd wreck me.

338
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,558
You're not a man to be afraid.

339
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,151
The odds are too great against me.

340
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,992
I've seen so much death
I want to stay alive.

341
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:49,259
Mr. Darrow, sir...

342
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:52,200
I expect the honor of your call
on Saturday.

343
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,729
Yes or no?

344
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:00,609
You'll be there.

345
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:26,897
I want your word he can come calling Saturday
with no trouble from you or your maggots.

346
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,737
Which one of them red-eyes is snorir?

347
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:55,124
Mars entitled to quiet in his own home.

348
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,542
I want your word.

349
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,807
- If I give you my word, will you give me yourn?
- On what?

350
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,711
That you give me a chance
to show him up for what he is:

351
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:15,274
A dollar-grabby blackleg who'd drag
his belly from here to Santa Fe...

352
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:18,878
- for three dollars in gold or in silver.
- Or in T.C. S?

353
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,050
He's a puny moneyman who's out
to revenge me for the Darrow Strip...

354
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,526
and who ain't got bone enough
to fair fiight.

355
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:27,723
He'll gouge back at me by
doing my daughter malice and harm.

356
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:32,132
That's my lookout. I've always worked
my own leather. I'll work it now.

357
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,366
I want a yes or a no about Saturday.

358
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:40,707
- Have I got your word I can show him up?
- If you can, that's fair.

359
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,712
Then you have my word.

360
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:44,782
Bring the man on.

361
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:54,586
Well, where is he? Where's the dude?
Where's the tinorn gambler?

362
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:57,684
I think the icing on the cake -
she melt away.

363
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,458
I think so.

364
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:03,466
Well, Daughter, appears like
your caller ain't gonna show.

365
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:06,298
I wasted me most of the day.
I don't propose to waste more.

366
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,702
If he calls, I'll be to hand.

367
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,547
You deal fiine.

368
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:27,243
- But a slow payoff cuts down on the play.

369
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,985
- Speed up the payoff.
- All right, Mr. Darrow.

370
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:41,325
Clever of you.
Smart as a whip.

371
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:46,861
I told you I didn't want the Legal Tender
wrecked. Didrt want to take on The Furies.

372
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:49,906
That's all I need -word to get back
to your father you've been here.

373
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:52,169
Do you have brains enough to know that?

374
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:55,110
Are you cooled down?

375
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:03,911
Gonna act like a child,
I'll have to treat you like one.

376
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:19,629
No one ever hit me before.

377
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:22,103
You're like a fiilly
that never had a rope on her.

378
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,640
- I waited for you all day.
- That was your doing.

379
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,472
- You said you'd be there.
- No, you said I'd be there.

380
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:29,478
I didn't say a word.

381
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,981
Watch me for that, Vance,
and don't misinterpret.

382
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,609
I baked you a cake.

383
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,052
I brought it along. I -

384
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,351
I didn't want it to go to waste.

385
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,619
You brought it to shove it in my face.

386
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:46,527
- That's just exactly ri -
- Uh-uh. It's too good for that.

387
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,373
You -

388
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:02,175
You're looking at me with eyebrow lifted.

389
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,647
If you've a question to ask me, ask me.
Out with it.

390
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,379
If you have something to tell me,
tell me. Out with it.

391
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,785
I was so sure of myself.

392
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:14,016
I was so sure I could handle him
or anyone...

393
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:17,720
and now I - I don't know.

394
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:21,959
You have love for this man, huh?
This, uh, Rip Darrow.

395
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:24,967
Some weeks I think I know him well.

396
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:28,436
Some weeks I'm sure I don't know him at all.

397
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,871
Sometimes I think T.C. Is right -

398
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:33,739
that he's a moneyman,
that money means more to him.

399
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,939
Maybe - Maybe in his time
he has been hungry.

400
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:40,643
To a hungry man,
money is always important.

401
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,879
I don't think I like being in love.

402
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:45,946
It puts a bit in my mouth.

403
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,893
You're in love with me.

404
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:53,555
Since you had your fiirst pony.

405
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:57,532
Tell me, Juan.
Do you like being in love?

406
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,967
It has been with me for so long that...

407
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:04,337
whether I like it or not,
without it I would be a lost man.

408
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,246
Come in.

409
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,285
Still dealing from the bottom of the deck?

410
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,355
Watch me.

411
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:08,668
Sometimes I think those are
the only women that it's in you to love.

412
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:12,072
Why not? They're new,
and they're smooth to touch.

413
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,046
They're exciting,
and they're honest.

414
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,914
When they're against you,
they don't make you think they're for you.

415
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,951
When they're for you,
they bring you money.

416
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,146
Too bad they've got two heads.

417
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,715
"When they're for you,
they bring you money."

418
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,490
I could bring a man money.
Lots of it.

419
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,588
$50,000.

420
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,599
You've mentioned it often enough.

421
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:39,295
- It's a royal dowry.
- It is.

422
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:44,939
Rip, do you ever mean to
ask me in marriage?

423
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:48,034
I do my own proposing.
Remember that.

424
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:52,439
Ask me again to call on you
at The Furies.

425
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,885
If I ever get you there,
I'll never let you go.

426
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:05,161
- Ask me.
- Mr. Darrow, sir...

427
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:09,427
may I expect the honor of your call
at The Furies tomorrow?

428
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,695
Yes.

429
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,999
But there's never a word of love from you.

430
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,404
Except for women like that.

431
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,509
They're honest.

432
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,008
But they lack flesh and blood.

433
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:49,297
Welcome to The Furies, sir.

434
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,307
I see the retainers.

435
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,309
Where's the king?

436
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,777
In his countinghouse, waiting.

437
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:59,482
Miss Jeffords.

438
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,552
Mr. Darrow, sir.

439
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:13,530
If he's smiling, be smart.
If he's not smiling, be smarter.

440
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,368
I believe you gentlemen have met.

441
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,674
Mr. Jeffords, sir, my honor and pleasure.

442
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:39,384
If I hold out my hand this time,
will you shake it, or...

443
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,390
will you shoot it off?

444
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:43,460
Been readir me a book
of Napoléors writings.

445
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:47,258
He says the only use of gals is to
marry 'em off in advantageous alliances.

446
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:50,095
That's what he writ.

447
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:53,728
Scotty tells me you've been buying some
cattle from The Furies for cash.

448
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,797
I've gone in for a little cattle brokerage
and some friendly banking.

449
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:00,809
Mr. Darrow, I hate a man that's mealymouthed,
so I'll come smack out with it.

450
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:02,811
- Fine.
- You love my daughter?

451
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:06,675
- Yes.
- She love you?

452
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:12,012
- She thinks she does.
- She's blind. I aim to make her see.

453
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,650
- I have her word I can show you up
for the puny, money-loving red-eye you be.
- Father.

454
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,729
I have your word.
I'll vow you know what this is.

455
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:21,354
- $50,000.
- Count it.

456
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:25,265
My daughter's dowry, if she picks a man
that's fiit for her, and you, sir, ain't fiit.

457
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:29,738
- You have the stump.
- My daughter takes you to husband,
I'll cut her off without a two-cent piece.

458
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,899
You'll get her as she stands,
not a whit more.

459
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:33,943
But if you walk out now
and let my daughter be...

460
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,979
you can keep the whole bundle
and won'th it to me.

461
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,344
Now take her and git,
or take the money and git, but git.

462
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:52,027
- Rip.
- I knew it.

463
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:54,154
I knew the cash would bait him.

464
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,165
I'll take the money...

465
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,565
but you really didn't have to do it.

466
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,069
- I never told your daughter I'd marry her.
- You did!

467
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,766
- And I had no intention of doing so.
- You did!

468
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,843
I'd be foolhardy to call a Jeffords a liar.

469
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:08,844
When you said you'd come calling.

470
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:12,143
Vance, I told you I'd do my own proposing...

471
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:14,444
and I warned you not to misinterpret me.

472
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,319
Consult your father here on misinterpretation.
He's an expert.

473
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:21,721
I believe, sir, you won
the Darrow Strip in court...

474
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,726
on a theory of misinterpretation.

475
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:27,787
I told you, Daughter, he was using you
to gouge back at me for the Darrow Strip.

476
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:32,664
And you're not ready to marry.
Not to me or anyone else.

477
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,568
Because you're married already-
to The Furies.

478
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:40,576
You don't want a husband. You'd just
like to have a man handy at The Furies.

479
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,446
If you don't want
word of this to get around...

480
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,915
don't try to wreck the Legal Tender.

481
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:56,020
My thanks for my invitation to The Furies.

482
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,095
I've enjoyed my call.

483
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,365
Miss Jeffords.

484
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,995
Mr. Jeffords, sir.

485
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:26,555
T. C...

486
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:29,353
we've been taken
like a couple of suckling pigs.

487
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:37,524
He hit me.
No one else ever did before.

488
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,762
And he made me cry.

489
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:43,135
No one else ever did before.

490
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,144
Welcome home.

491
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:52,374
I'll unpack my bags...

492
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,451
and stay a while.

493
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,166
I like a nice, simple contract.

494
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:20,175
The Darrow Bank.

495
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:23,075
The Darrow Bank is to conduct
all business in this territory...

496
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,080
for the Anaheim Bank.

497
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:28,208
Except for any business at The Furies.

498
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,219
I'm not exactly welcome there.

499
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:34,289
You'll handle our business
at The Furies too.

500
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:36,359
Frankly, our bank
wouldn't be signing with you...

501
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,987
and you wouldn't be buying cattle for
Bailey Brothers if you hadrt swindled old T.C.

502
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:42,930
Swindled is a harsh word, Mr. Anaheim.

503
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:46,594
Harsh or not, the story we had
had a certain appeal for my father.

504
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:49,195
He likes anybody
who can outfox old T.C.

505
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,274
Here's the confiirmation on El Paso.
I told you they'd weaken.

506
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:55,311
You were right again.

507
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:58,939
I mean, you've taken to business
like a fur trader to sin.

508
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:02,780
- I mean, you -
- Oh, stop buttering up to me, Scotty.

509
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:05,617
- What's that you're trying to hide?
- Oh -

510
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:10,385
Oh, T.C., have a heart.
You're spending it faster than I can make it.

511
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:14,123
Another six months away, and he'll have
the entire nation knee-deep in T.C.s.

512
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:16,893
Print up another batch, Scotty.

513
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,935
Senor Bailey.

514
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,936
Welcome once again, Mr. Bailey.

515
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,506
Senor Anaheim Jr.

516
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:25,871
Miss Jeffords, may I present Mr. Anaheim?

517
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:29,503
- Welcome to The Furies, sir.
- I'd conceived an image of you, Miss Jeffords...

518
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:31,877
but it pales beside the actuality.

519
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:34,041
You have a way with a compliment.

520
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:36,142
Mr. Darrow.

521
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:39,620
I believe you know Mr. Darrow.

522
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,657
His bank is our new agent in this territory.

523
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:44,455
Congratulations, Mr. Bailey.

524
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,963
Mr. Darrow has the smell
of a successful businessman.

525
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:52,593
I'm sure you know the luck I wish you.

526
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:55,263
Yeah. Thank you, Miss Jeffords.

527
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,340
What about the renewal of our loan?

528
00:42:57,441 --> 00:43:00,069
Mr. Anaheim Sr. Isn't sure
he'll renew his loan on The Furies.

529
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:02,338
- Why not?
- Squatters.

530
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:05,540
Oh. So that's still rubbing them -
the cloud on title.

531
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:08,083
If you would permit me to drive
the Herreras out -

532
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:11,154
No.

533
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,815
Mr. Darrow, how would I go about...

534
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:17,724
persuading this son of a banker
to change his father's mind?

535
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:21,491
Your most persuasive
should be persuasive enough.

536
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,999
Think so?

537
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,559
Chiquita, food and drink for our guests.
I'll join you gentlemen in a moment.

538
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:30,231
Mr. Darrow, Scotty has a word for you.

539
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:32,775
Burn out the pueblecitos.
Get rid of them any way you can.

540
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:35,310
But not the Herreras.
I'll handle them in my own way.

541
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:39,473
- Is that satisfactory, Mr. Darrow?
- Burn 'em out. Kill 'em all.

542
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:42,848
- Simple T.C. Way.
- Scotty, your word for Mr. Darrow.

543
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:47,287
Any business you have with The Furies, send
for me, and we'll conduct it at your offiice, but...

544
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:50,121
don't ever set foot on The Furies again.

545
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:52,195
Is that clear?

546
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,264
Perfectly, Miss Jeffords.

547
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:58,095
Let me look at you
in your new suit.

548
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:02,763
Still as handsome as ever, aren't you?

549
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,969
Burn them out!

550
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:05,769
Juan!

551
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:12,434
Vance, you all right?

552
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,910
Next time, don't make
your welcome so warm.

553
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:47,473
Buenas noches, señora.

554
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,445
- Muchachos.

555
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,656
You play with big marbles.

556
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:13,164
We thought you were El Tigre
come to try to burn us out.

557
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,864
Like those fiires down there.

558
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:19,136
I'm asking you to leave The Furies
once and for all.

559
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:25,815
Is that why you honor us?

560
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:28,407
I have T.C.'s word you won't be touched.

561
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:32,914
You look like T. C...

562
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:36,390
standing there,
ordering us off our land.

563
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:38,484
- Gracias.

564
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:41,928
She doesn't like me any better
than T.C. Likes you.

565
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:43,932
- It is so.
- "It is so. Gracias."

566
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:46,434
You're cold as a blue norther.
What are you so galled about?

567
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:49,529
T.C.'s been away, and I sent for you,
and you didn't show up. Why not?

568
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,905
- Because I chose not to.
- That's blunt enough.

569
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,910
I have no stomach for the way you live.

570
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:57,310
- That's too bad. Anything else?
- Yes.

571
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:00,611
You cannot blot out the fiire within you
with this other man.

572
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:03,242
No more than the pueblecitos
can blot out El Tigre's fiire.

573
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:05,150
If you're talking about Rip,
I'm over that.

574
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:07,883
Oh. Are you?

575
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:13,194
Always pulling the bit on me!
Always telling the truth! Juan the saint!

576
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:18,325
Well, now I'm galled. Go on. Dish up the bread.
Let's break it, and let me get out of here.

577
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:22,269
All right. Never mind looking for it.
It happens I brought some along.

578
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:35,385
Stay, Juan. I need you.

579
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:38,386
There's no one else
to pull the bit on me when I'm wrong.

580
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,351
Till our eyes next meet?

581
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,929
Till then.

582
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,996
Flo, may I present my daughter Vance?

583
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:30,062
Daughter, I'd like you to meet an old and dear
friend of mine, Mrs. Florence Burnett.

584
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:32,835
- Delighted, I'm sure.
- My dear.

585
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:37,971
- You look so wonderfully healthy.
- I told you, didn't I?

586
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,981
She's one in a nation.

587
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:43,177
Hey, Scotty, El Tig,
let's get this gear stashed.

588
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:47,348
- Mrs.?
- My husband passed on some time ago.

589
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:50,017
My dear.

590
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:52,322
I hope I shart be too much bother.

591
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:55,227
You won't be. No bother at all.

592
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,425
We have guests coming all the time.

593
00:48:57,534 --> 00:49:00,594
Come on, Flo. I want to show you the house.

594
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:13,847
It was her idea, senora, not mine.

595
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,818
I burn out the pueblecitos,
they return.

596
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,481
It will always be so until
the Herreras are driven from The Furies.

597
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:23,081
- I understand, Tigre.
- Good evening.

598
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:25,093
My dear, do come in.

599
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:27,163
Do sit down. Please.

600
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:29,664
I'm pleased the Tiger entertained you...

601
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:32,394
during T.C.'s visit to his wife's room.

602
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:34,868
Of course, I knew El Tigre by repute.

603
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:38,135
At one time his name
was quite a worry to Washington.

604
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:42,405
Senora Burnett, I hope your stay here
will be long and memorable.

605
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:45,345
Thank you, El Tigre.
I'm sure it will be.

606
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:49,078
Burnett. Oh, yes. Of course. I -

607
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:51,882
I knew I'd seen that name often.

608
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,480
Signed as endorsement
on the backs of checks...

609
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:56,491
made out by Temple to cash?

610
00:49:56,593 --> 00:50:00,461
Well, T.C. Is so loose and free and easy
with his money.

611
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:03,362
Doesrt make much difference, my dear...

612
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:05,992
as long as he gets his money's won'th.

613
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:08,037
But does he?

614
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:12,336
Now that's what I like to see.
I want you two to take a shine to each other.

615
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,967
Why, Temple, I feel as though
we were old friends already.

616
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:17,012
Ah, that is fiine.

617
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:20,606
Daughter, hadrt been for Flo, I'd still have been
shinir the seat of my breeches in Washington.

618
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:22,947
- Oh, now, Temple -
- Yeah. It's - Go on. Tell her.

619
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:24,953
- Really.
- Go on and tell her.

620
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:27,046
Just that I'd been acquainted
with the president...

621
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,182
- so that when it was necessary-
- The president?

622
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:31,920
Yeah
Flo fiixed a soiree.

623
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,657
Plunked him right down by me.
Cut out all the red tape.

624
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:38,292
You can talk to him.
He's no 9:00 dude.

625
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:42,896
The range rights acquired from the government
are valuable. You've done The Furies a service.

626
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:45,099
You have a fiine knowledge
of the ways of politics.

627
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,541
You can hoot and holler that.

628
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:50,840
What's that?

629
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:53,381
Uh, my favorite.
Cognac in orange juice.

630
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:55,383
- Try it, my dear.
- No, thank you.

631
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:59,649
The oranges will be piling up by the crate.
I telegraphed Bailey in San Francisco.

632
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:03,385
Any libation any of my folks want.
That's what my folks is gonna get.

633
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:05,961
Why, Temple, how wonderfully
thoughtful of you.

634
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,657
I'm tired. I think I'll turn in.

635
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:10,733
- Good night.
- Good night, dear.

636
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:12,802
Good night, my dear.

637
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:18,141
I'm afraid this house
isn't like the houses you're used to.

638
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:21,144
I only hope you'll be comfortable.

639
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:24,475
My dear, it seems like home already.

640
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:28,778
Flo, scratch my sixth lumbar vertebra.

641
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:34,887
Say, Flo, did I ever tell you how I got this?

642
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:37,084
Remember?
I met up with a party of Osages?

643
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:39,958
- Yes, Temple. I know. You told me.
- Oh, yeah. I told ya.

644
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:44,033
Ah, that feels good.

645
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:50,331
- That's it, Pop.
- All right, Son.

646
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:55,640
Here. Your payment.

647
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:01,310
If it makes any difference, Miss Vance,
you gave me T.C. S for the last load.

648
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:05,115
The boss told me this time to -
to make sure and got the cash.

649
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:07,656
You'll take these T.C.s.

650
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:11,215
But the boss - he says he was
most particular- he -

651
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:15,793
Yes, Miss Vance. Yes, ma'am.

652
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:24,299
Pop, you must be getting feeble.
She rode you right down.

653
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:29,679
- Any other remarks, Son?
- No, Pop.

654
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:31,906
- Come along.
- Yes, Pop.

655
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:40,014
The last transaction with Bailey
showed about...

656
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:42,216
seven and one-third percent profiit?

657
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:45,260
Not about seven and a third. Exactly.

658
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:48,798
I mean, you do a perfect job of calculating.

659
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:51,367
- I mean -
- My dear, do come in.

660
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:53,698
Scotty's been making
a wonderfully brave attempt...

661
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:57,170
to show me the way
a ranch is run, but to no avail.

662
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:59,435
I don't see how you do manage all this.

663
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:02,171
- And as for blaming you-
- What blame?

664
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:04,213
For the squatters' return to The Furies.

665
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:08,114
I told Temple that's no fiit work for a lady-
burnings and the like.

666
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:11,415
I told him you're not to be blamed
one bit for your failure.

667
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:14,081
- Thanks.
- My dear...

668
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,557
I had a wonderful notion.

669
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,595
I had a notion you'd have
a wonderful notion.

670
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:22,062
To aid you.
I thought I'd write -

671
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:24,690
I thought I'd have Temple write
to Mr. Bailey...

672
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:28,259
to send an experienced manager
to take the burden from you.

673
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,999
- Why?
- My dear...

674
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:35,009
it's a sacrilege that so lovely a creature
as you has been kept at The Furies -

675
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:39,104
that you haven't been granted your opportunity
to make the grand tour of Europe -

676
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,650
Paris, Vienna, Budapest -

677
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:44,242
I like it here just fiine.

678
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:46,914
You're such a brave creature.

679
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:49,890
- And believe me, I do understand.
- That's more than I do.

680
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:53,895
I, too, have had my full portion
of unfortunate romance.

681
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:55,931
So I know exactly.

682
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:59,524
The wisest way is to forget Rip Darrow
and the way you've been tormented.

683
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:01,627
The wisest way is to take a long trip.

684
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:05,265
Ah, that's what I like to see -
you two hennir away together.

685
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:07,275
Come on, Flo.
This'll be fiit to watch.

686
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:10,938
- MartyJaeger's breaking in that bay cayuse.
- Yes, Temple.

687
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:13,481
It'll be all right, my dear.
You'll see.

688
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:16,950
The bay's got an iron mouth!

689
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:18,953
- Father.
- Yes, Daughter?

690
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,491
Nothing.

691
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:29,193
Ah, mayhap you're right, Flo.

692
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:31,460
She has been gettirmoody
the past few weeks.

693
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:35,834
- Mayhap a change for her-
- Ah, Temple, you're so understanding.

694
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:44,536
I'm sorry about showing the books,
Miss Vance...

695
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:47,173
but she and I got to talking, and...

696
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:50,947
fiirst thing I know,
the safe was open, the books out.

697
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:52,954
I mean -

698
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:55,217
I know just what you mean.

699
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:04,130
# It was in the merry month of May #

700
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:07,670
- I just don't know how to fiight her.

701
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:10,831
It's like hitting the wind.
It freezes me.

702
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,841
I always thought I'd enjoy
seeing you broke to halter.

703
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:16,707
But I don't enjoy it, not a whit.

704
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,713
- Turn to her.
- No.

705
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,715
- Now.

706
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,717
Now look at her, Vance.

707
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:26,448
You're not fiighting Bailey or the Anaheim Bank,
and you're not up against the wind.

708
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:28,990
- You're fiighting a woman, that's all.

709
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:31,993
Well, git 'r go,
where'd you latch onto that 'un?

710
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,723
I thought only a hereabout ranahan
knew about that!

711
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,731
I'll tell you a secret, sir.

712
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,666
I heard it for the fiirst time today.
I heard it, and I learned it.

713
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:41,930
- I was in hopes it would please you, sir.
- All right.

714
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:44,905
- It was when I embraced her 

715
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,067
##In my arms ##

716
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,509
##I thought she had ##

717
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:51,842
#Ten thousand charms #

718
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:56,578
# Her caress was soft
and her kisses sweet #

719
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,984
# Say we'll get married #

720
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:01,216
# Next time we meet #

721
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:03,918
# Oh, curse your gold #

722
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,461
#And your silver too #

723
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:08,895
# God pity the girl #

724
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:11,296
#That don't prove true #

725
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:13,596
# I'll travel west #

726
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:16,001
#Where the bullets fly #

727
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:18,438
#And I'll stay on the trail #

728
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,975
#Till the day I die ##

729
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:52,505
- Vance.
- What are you doing here?

730
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:56,303
I come out here when I'm restless.

731
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,313
It's the Darrow Strip, isn't it?

732
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:03,318
Or is it because we rode here,
you and I, that night we met?

733
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,718
Take your choice.

734
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:08,985
Either way, it shows
you have a haunted streak.

735
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,992
That's good to know.

736
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,255
What are you doing here?

737
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:16,799
I ride out here
whenever I'm restless too.

738
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,494
That was honest.

739
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:23,197
That's a dainty little Derringer.
May I see it?

740
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,378
- Real dainty.

741
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,713
Don't return here, Mr. Darrow.
I'll kill you if you do.

742
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:41,688
Vance.

743
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:44,316
Mr. Darrow?

744
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:46,395
You're really on the prod.

745
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:49,465
Like the cattle,
all set to stampede.

746
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:52,860
All set.

747
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:56,234
You'd like me to take you
in my arms, wouldn't you?

748
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:03,379
Sleep well.

749
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:26,434
What are you up to in here?

750
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:30,438
Waiting for a chance to see you,
to talk to you alone.

751
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,508
All right.

752
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:38,407
Sure been actir woman-y
this past month.

753
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:43,584
- Flo's a friend of mine.
- I hadrt mentioned Flo.

754
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,587
And a good friend of yours too,
if you'd only know it.

755
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,590
Fine, fiine. I'll light the candles
on her birthday.

756
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,422
What is it she gives you, T.C.?

757
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:56,056
All your life you've had a craving to fiind
a woman and a lady in the same body.

758
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:59,100
That's it, isn't it?
Elegance and refiinement.

759
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:02,103
You found the lady in my mother,
but she wasrt woman enough for you, was she?

760
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,605
- That's enough of that kind of talk!
- It's more than enough!

761
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:07,107
What's come over you,
backbitir guests under your own roof?

762
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,110
- My roof?
- Stop talkir such dip!

763
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,442
I don't know whose roof it'll turn out to be.

764
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,948
We've no cash. People are beginning
to mistrust the T.C.'s.

765
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,450
And Old Anaheim's sitting in his bank
ready to knife us!

766
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,317
Can't talk like that in her room.

767
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:22,323
You gotta gab dip, do it out here,
not in there. It ain't fiittir.

768
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:25,326
Go ahead, wreck yourself.
But don't wreck The Furies with you!

769
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:27,328
The Furies is mine.

770
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:30,729
I hooked it together,
and I'll crank it apart if it so pleases me.

771
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:33,267
- What are you laughing at?
- You.

772
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:37,271
It's been so long since you were mad enough
to bellow, I thought you were getting puny.

773
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:39,273
Me, puny?

774
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:42,936
Yeah, don't think a good bellow
ain't real pleasurable.

775
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:46,174
Daughter, when you gets an idea
you stampede like a herd.

776
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:49,945
I told you once -The Furies is yours
to use and boss with me in my lifetime.

777
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:52,453
And it's all yours after that,
the whole shebang.

778
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:54,955
That is my word to you.
Have I ever broken it?

779
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:56,958
How long will she stay?

780
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:00,621
When we hang the latch string out at
The Furies, we put no time limit on it, do we?

781
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:04,291
- No.
- Well, I'll tell you this.

782
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,301
She's fiixir to visit San Francisco
before much longer.

783
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:09,303
Good.
I'll help her pack.

784
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:11,669
Temple.

785
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,674
I've been waiting, Temple.

786
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:16,176
Oh, yeah.
I clean forgot.

787
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,679
You don't mean to ride
in this rain.

788
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:22,478
Oh, my dear,
I'm not one who'll melt away.

789
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:24,280
Are you so sure?

790
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,037
- What are you doing in her room?
- My dear, do come in.

791
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:46,404
It was so good of you
to have Chiquita prepare me this tea.

792
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:49,501
I always did say hot tea was
a womars best ally against the rain.

793
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:52,513
I told Chiquita to bring it
to your room, not here.

794
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:56,244
I shall miss Chiquita, and you,
and all The Furies.

795
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:58,252
You'll what?

796
01:00:58,354 --> 01:01:00,584
I leave for San Francisco next week.

797
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:03,591
I don't know when
I've enjoyed a stay more, my dear.

798
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:06,594
I do wish I could express
how grateful I am to you.

799
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:08,596
My dear, don't try.

800
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:12,361
I hope you'll visit The Furies again...
sometime.

801
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,904
- Oh, then your father hasn't told you.
- Told me what?

802
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:19,770
Why, he's journeying
to San Francisco with me.

803
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:21,776
We're to be married there.

804
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:24,779
While we're away,
this room will be done over completely.

805
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:28,612
And then I think the room
will suit mejust perfectly.

806
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:44,198
Why?

807
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,791
I don't understand.

808
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:49,771
Why do you marry him?

809
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:52,272
Extraordinary question.

810
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,775
The answer, my dear,
is somewhat more simple.

811
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:58,608
A woman of my age can get very lonely,
and I fiind T.C. Companionable -

812
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,309
That's drivel.
You want his money, and you know it.

813
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:03,851
Of course. That too.

814
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:05,853
I once married for love.

815
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:08,856
The marriage failed
for the lack of money.

816
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:10,858
Money makes life soothing.

817
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,928
I mean to have it.

818
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:17,659
And if some term me an adventuress,
why, I suppose that's what I am.

819
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:21,335
You know, a most extraordinary thing
your father did.

820
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:23,337
He gave me $50,000 outright...

821
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:26,340
and then proposed to me
for the fiirst time.

822
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:29,309
It's yours.
Why do you marry him?

823
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,812
Perhaps for love of a man.

824
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:34,405
Or perhaps for love ofThe Furies.

825
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:37,418
- You told her.
- She has.

826
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,920
I said it was a thing
I'd tell her myself.

827
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:42,923
Temple, I knew how diffiicult
it would be for you.

828
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:46,586
I was my wish to ease it for you,
to help you to smooth it.

829
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:49,426
Daughter, I wanted Flo
to be a friend to you.

830
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:53,332
She yanked the blinkers off of me and made me see
what an ornery ol' moss horn I was to -

831
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:57,964
To work you so very hard, my dear,
to compel such self-sacrifiice of you.

832
01:02:58,074 --> 01:02:59,974
So it's all been wonderfully arranged.

833
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:02,772
Mr. Bailey has a competent man
on his way here now...

834
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:04,779
to take the load
of running The Furies promptly.

835
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:06,781
Yeah, it's fiittin',

836
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:09,784
He'll evict the squatters,
as Mr. Anaheim insists.

837
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:12,286
All of the squatters,
including the Herreras.

838
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:14,879
No! I have your word
they're not to be touched.

839
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:17,391
My dear, the entire territory
will envy you...

840
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:20,394
because you're to make
the wonderful grand tour of Europe.

841
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:24,330
I envy you myself,
to see all that for the fiirst time.

842
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:26,628
And, my dear, please remember...

843
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:29,637
there will always be room for you
at The Furies.

844
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:32,833
There will always be a room for her.
Wort there, Temple?

845
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,518
El Tigre! Everybody! El Tigre!

846
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:55,563
If she dies, I'll kill you.

847
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:58,031
Get out!

848
01:03:58,134 --> 01:04:00,898
Scotty! El Tig!
Here! Up here!

849
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,600
- Dr. Grieve.
- Yes?

850
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:17,611
- Your fee.
- Oh.

851
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:21,615
- Well -
- Enough?

852
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:24,652
Magnifiicent, sir. A royal fee.

853
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,654
- How is she?
- Mrs. Burnett?

854
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,020
Oh, her face will be
forever disfiigured -

855
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:31,286
a permanent partial paralysis.

856
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:34,557
But considering that the wound was deep
and bordered on a vein...

857
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:37,565
I'd say that I did
a very decent job.

858
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:39,430
Good night, Doctor.

859
01:05:39,535 --> 01:05:41,503
Well, interesting night, at any rate.

860
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:46,174
Full of promise.

861
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:01,822
- Where'd she go?
- To the Herreras.

862
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:04,051
Luis trailed her halfway up there.

863
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:07,824
Mr. Jeffords,
she's your own flesh and blood.

864
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:09,955
She's a canker to be cut out!

865
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:18,907
Come on, boys!

866
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:57,338
Oh, my leg!

867
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,340
My leg.

868
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:02,343
The old witch nailed me.

869
01:08:02,445 --> 01:08:04,845
Ah, you'll live.
Get that sack.

870
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,476
Cover me!

871
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:28,967
Toss that one on your horns,
you misbegotten old bull.!

872
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:40,708
You are afraid, huh?

873
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:42,716
There's no need for fear.

874
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:45,309
We have waited a long time for this day.

875
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:55,664
- Look at the mother witch!

876
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:05,172
Still a ways short!

877
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:08,334
Only one thing for it - get closer!
Come on! Move it up! Come on!

878
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:10,344
Come on!

879
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:12,505
Any closer,
and we'd all be pigeons.

880
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:16,517
Those Herreras can hit
a pigeon in the eye at 300 yards.

881
01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:29,096
You willing to get killed?

882
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:32,224
- No, but it's my profession.

883
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:49,411
- Mama! Mama! 

884
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:14,434
The crawling old fool creeps closer.

885
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:16,443
Come, my old one.

886
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:21,448
Come, my toro.

887
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:24,849
A little more
and I send you to the flames!

888
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:30,324
You are afraid, yes?

889
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:33,452
Not for yourself, but for him.

890
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:36,759
You're afraid
that he will be killed, huh?

891
01:10:36,865 --> 01:10:39,925
The old bull
is pawing his way into the trap.

892
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:41,935
Ha.!

893
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:45,837
Come, my old one.
Come, my toro.

894
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:47,909
Closer.

895
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:54,713
Now that rock, my old one.

896
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:57,047
Creep past that rock.

897
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:02,517
No, Mama.

898
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:06,117
That is enough.
We will yield to the old one.

899
01:11:06,228 --> 01:11:09,026
- Juanito!
- We will go away from The Furies.

900
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:15,333
My friend wants it that way.

901
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:27,881
I am the eldest!

902
01:11:27,983 --> 01:11:31,885
Since when has the word of the eldest
not been the word for all?

903
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:33,955
Since when?

904
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:42,629
Vámonos, Vance.

905
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:07,722
Hey!

906
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:11,918
- SenorJeffords!
- Yeah? What is it?

907
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:14,928
We do not admit defeat...

908
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:16,930
but we will surrender...

909
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:21,935
if you give me your word
that we can all go free in safety.

910
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:25,529
It's a lie, a trap.
He means to throw us in for the kill.

911
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:28,769
A trap? Why should they lie?
They ain't like you.

912
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:31,345
You been trespassir The Furies
long enough.

913
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:33,415
Go, and good riddance to you!

914
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:37,575
- We have your word?
- Yes! Yes, I said!

915
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:39,586
It is agreed.

916
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:41,656
Come up.

917
01:12:52,234 --> 01:12:54,759
All right, you can come out now,
my brave men!

918
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:00,108
Come on. Bring those horses in.

919
01:13:27,836 --> 01:13:31,738
- Get their guns.
- Cut that bay out and bring him to me.

920
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,741
Get offThe Furies
and stay offThe Furies forever.

921
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:37,744
You can take a horse apiece
and not one whit more.

922
01:13:37,846 --> 01:13:40,747
This bay here -
What outfiit does he belong to?

923
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:43,818
It belongs to me.
You know that.

924
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:48,151
The bay has a Furies mark.
He was stolen six months ago.

925
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:50,657
Dance on the air.

926
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:53,660
Tigre, you still got a hankerir
to see a man hang?

927
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:57,664
If this thief would hang, never again
would a squatter dare appear on The Furies.

928
01:13:57,766 --> 01:13:59,666
That's true, but I've given my word.

929
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:03,465
For trespassing,
not for stealing horses and cattle.

930
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:06,473
It is our right on the land
to take a horse.

931
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:10,067
A cow, a calf-
enough to live on and no more.

932
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:13,615
It has always been the right
of the Herreras on this land.

933
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:15,945
The thief, he talks of rights.

934
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:19,043
- Well, patrón?
- Hang him.

935
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:27,961
He means me to beg.

936
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:30,964
To beg him for your life.

937
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:33,159
- All right, I will.
- Wait.

938
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:39,334
It is true,
he means you to beg.

939
01:14:39,441 --> 01:14:42,808
It is also true
that should you beg...

940
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:46,014
he will hang me anyway.

941
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:51,349
He sits his stallion...

942
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:53,421
stiff with hate.

943
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:01,696
You will not humble yourself.

944
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:04,799
This I ask.

945
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,537
Amen.

946
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:32,520
Juan.

947
01:16:36,858 --> 01:16:39,156
The kiss of a good friend.

948
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:42,486
Till our eyes...

949
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:44,759
next meet.

950
01:16:44,866 --> 01:16:46,834
Till then.

951
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:05,852
Tears a body to see
someone you love hurt, doesn't it?

952
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:09,515
Do you want me to beg?
Do you want me on my knees to you for his life?

953
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,525
- I'd hang him anyway.
- That's what he said.

954
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:14,187
- He did, eh? He always was smart.
- Well, you're not!

955
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:17,595
You're old, you're getting foolish and you've
made a mistake! It's me you should have hung!

956
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:21,100
Because now I hate you
in a way I didn't know a human could hate.

957
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:23,535
Take a good, long look at me, T.C.

958
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:27,905
You won't see me again
until the day I take your world away from you!

959
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:37,508
Juanito.

960
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:39,587
Juanito.

961
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:42,816
Juanito.!

962
01:19:04,806 --> 01:19:06,706
- Hi there, honey.
- Where's Rip?

963
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:09,936
He'll be back most any time.

964
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:13,014
- Did you just get in off the railroad?
- Yes.

965
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:17,684
We haven't met before.

966
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:21,347
My name's Dallas Hart.
I'm new in town, honey.

967
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:23,481
Honey, you wouldn't be new anyplace.

968
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:26,652
Don't tell me.
You're VanceJeffords.

969
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,491
Rip tell you about me?

970
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,497
No, but everyone else has.

971
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,658
And I can believe what they say.

972
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:37,671
Night, Dallas.

973
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:40,139
- But, Rip -
- I said good night.

974
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:44,878
I never could see what they see
in the thin ones.

975
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:46,948
It's not what they see.

976
01:19:57,592 --> 01:19:59,753
You've been away a long time.

977
01:19:59,861 --> 01:20:02,830
And you've marked off the days
on your calendar.

978
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:09,065
You're not so calm and collected
as you're trying to make out.

979
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:12,072
- I'm out to get The Furies for myself.

980
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:14,142
How?

981
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:18,178
T.C.s.

982
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:21,181
I've been running what Scotty calls
a bear raid on the T.C.s.

983
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:24,411
These past months I've covered
every mile of track on the railroad.

984
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:28,421
I've spread word that they're won'thless,
that my father will never be able to pay them off.

985
01:20:28,523 --> 01:20:31,424
People been offering me those
for 80 cents on the dollar.

986
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:34,552
I expect to buy all I need
at 5 or 10 cents on the dollar.

987
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:37,131
You might. People panic.

988
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:40,964
Just, uh, how does this
get you The Furies?

989
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:46,804
Right here.
Black and white.

990
01:20:46,908 --> 01:20:48,876
In easy stages.

991
01:20:50,645 --> 01:20:54,672
Have I slipped up in any part of it?

992
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:57,445
I'm sure you haven't.

993
01:20:57,552 --> 01:20:59,816
It'll work.

994
01:20:59,921 --> 01:21:01,821
Fine.

995
01:21:01,923 --> 01:21:03,823
There's a certain irony.

996
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:05,825
In what?

997
01:21:05,927 --> 01:21:08,828
The key to the plan
lies in the Anaheim Bank.

998
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:12,422
- Getting it to extend T.C.'s mortgage.
- You're smart.

999
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:17,198
It wouldn't work
if Anaheim foreclosed on T.C. Not now.

1000
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:19,933
Not till we're ready.

1001
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:23,169
I'm the correspondent bank here
for Anaheim.

1002
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:27,510
But the decision must be made
by old man Anaheim himself.

1003
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:30,016
You know that.

1004
01:21:30,118 --> 01:21:32,609
- Why did you come to me?
- Money.

1005
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:35,121
Money to buy the T.C.s.

1006
01:21:55,443 --> 01:21:58,276
The dowry money- $50,000.

1007
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,644
I've kept it here for you.

1008
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:03,616
It's yours.
I'll pay you for the use of it.

1009
01:22:03,718 --> 01:22:07,119
I hope you know what you're doing.
If this works, it'll wreck your father.

1010
01:22:07,222 --> 01:22:11,625
I'll not let The Furies slip away from me,
and it certainly will if it's left to him and to her.

1011
01:22:11,726 --> 01:22:14,354
Not her. Him.

1012
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:17,158
It's T.C. You hate, isn't it, Vance?

1013
01:22:20,802 --> 01:22:23,737
You've found a new love in your life,
haven't you, Vance?

1014
01:22:23,838 --> 01:22:25,806
You're in love with hate.

1015
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:30,341
Well, if you're patient
and work hard at it...

1016
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:32,811
it may be all you'll need to live by.

1017
01:22:32,914 --> 01:22:35,280
I hope it'll be enough...

1018
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:38,318
because hate doesn't leave room
for anything else in your life.

1019
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:42,379
And I speak as one who has hated
the same man as you hate now.

1020
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,819
What's in this deal for me?

1021
01:22:49,698 --> 01:22:51,666
What do you want?

1022
01:22:51,766 --> 01:22:53,927
The Darrow Strip,
the sweetest part ofThe Furies.

1023
01:22:54,035 --> 01:22:56,128
By every fair right it's mine,
and I mean to have it.

1024
01:22:56,237 --> 01:23:01,698
Look at you. Just the thought of losing part of
The Furies, and you're ready to claw and scratch.

1025
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:03,710
Is it a deal?

1026
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:06,872
Does it make sense to you
to give up 10%% ofThe Furies to save 90%%?

1027
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:10,918
It's a deal.

1028
01:23:12,287 --> 01:23:14,255
Good.

1029
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:17,825
When do we go to San Francisco
to hit Old Anaheim?

1030
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:21,295
The sooner the better.

1031
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:35,306
May I see you to your room?

1032
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:38,106
Are you sure
you won't extend the loan?

1033
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:41,979
It seems my father's been
waiting a long time to get at T.C.

1034
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:43,983
I'm sorry.

1035
01:23:44,085 --> 01:23:47,054
You should be.
Good night.

1036
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:51,185
- Yes?

1037
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:55,828
- What are you doing up so late?
- I couldn't sleep.

1038
01:23:55,930 --> 01:23:59,366
- Did you see young Anaheim?
- False alarm. Talks big, means little.

1039
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:01,765
I'll have to see the old man.

1040
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,668
Old Anaheim's got to extend the mortgage,
or we're licked.

1041
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:06,673
Otherwise T.C.
Won't round up the cattle...

1042
01:24:06,775 --> 01:24:09,175
and rounding up the cattle's
a job only T.C. Can do.

1043
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:12,508
Get The Furies's cattle,
and then get The Furies.

1044
01:24:12,614 --> 01:24:15,708
Look, it was your idea.

1045
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:18,651
- Don't weaken on me now.
- Don't worry.

1046
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:21,153
I'll take care of Old Anaheim.

1047
01:24:21,256 --> 01:24:23,383
Hmm.
Mighty confiident, aren't you?

1048
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:25,459
Sure you can handle any man.

1049
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,926
Well, look at you.

1050
01:24:32,033 --> 01:24:34,934
You'd like to hit me right now,
wouldn't you?

1051
01:24:35,036 --> 01:24:36,970
I would.

1052
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:40,041
Go ahead.

1053
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:44,643
Now you'd like to kiss me,
wouldn't you?

1054
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:47,647
Yes, I would.

1055
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:50,217
What's in it for me?

1056
01:24:50,318 --> 01:24:53,287
Is it won'th the Darrow Strip to you?

1057
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:02,063
Sleep well.

1058
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:15,908
- Good night, Mrs. Anaheim. Delightful party.
- Good night. Thank you.

1059
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:20,071
Emily, do convey my thanks
to your husband.

1060
01:25:20,181 --> 01:25:23,810
I'll convey your thanks to my husband.
Good night.

1061
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:30,221
Mrs. Anaheim, I can't thank you enough.
It's been a most interesting evening.

1062
01:25:30,325 --> 01:25:32,725
- I'm so glad.
- If you'll excuse me, my dear.

1063
01:25:32,827 --> 01:25:35,728
Miss Jeffords has no escort.
I'll take her to her hotel.

1064
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:38,731
Then I'll stop at the club.
I expect I'll be quite late.

1065
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:41,063
No, thank you, Mr. Anaheim.
I couldn't impose.

1066
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:43,069
But, Miss Jeffords, I, uh -

1067
01:25:43,171 --> 01:25:45,139
No, thank you, Mr. Anaheim.

1068
01:25:46,608 --> 01:25:48,508
Very well.

1069
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:50,737
- Good night.
- Good night.

1070
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:59,052
Thank you.

1071
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:01,054
You're welcome.

1072
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:04,057
You could have wrapped my husband
round your little fiinger.

1073
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,389
- That's right.
- Why didn't you?

1074
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:08,553
I came here for one purpose -

1075
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:12,565
to make sure T.C. Got
a 90-day extension on his mortgage.

1076
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:15,727
I feel somehow if I had permitted
Mr. Anaheim to see me home...

1077
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:17,737
I wouldn't have achieved that purpose.

1078
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:19,739
Why not?

1079
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:23,834
In the course of the evening, I realized
that you were the one to reckon with.

1080
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:27,073
You're a clever one.

1081
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:29,582
I don't control the Anaheim Bank...

1082
01:26:29,684 --> 01:26:32,084
but I do control Mr. Anaheim.

1083
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:34,587
And have I reckoned with you?

1084
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,589
I like a clever woman.

1085
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:38,591
I'll help you.

1086
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:41,093
Thank you.

1087
01:26:42,597 --> 01:26:44,997
He's a faithless husband...

1088
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:48,591
but he is my husband.

1089
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:56,036
Come on, come on.
Quit cat-and-mousir me. Yes or no?

1090
01:26:56,144 --> 01:26:59,045
No.
We foreclose The Furies immediately.

1091
01:26:59,147 --> 01:27:01,115
Good day.

1092
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:07,887
- T.C.
- Emily.

1093
01:27:07,989 --> 01:27:09,889
You reprobate.

1094
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:12,892
I was told this meeting wouldn't occur
until later in the day.

1095
01:27:12,994 --> 01:27:15,895
So if I'm somewhat out of breath
you'll forgive an old woman.

1096
01:27:15,997 --> 01:27:19,398
Old? If you was any younger, we'd have to
throw you down to get shoes on ya.

1097
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:22,765
I had the pleasure
of meeting your daughter.

1098
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:25,395
- Who?
- Your daughter.

1099
01:27:25,506 --> 01:27:28,805
Must be mistaken, Emily.
I have no daughter. Not anymore.

1100
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:33,709
Well, the old bear's
got his claws sunk in me.

1101
01:27:33,815 --> 01:27:35,715
What is it you want, T.C.?

1102
01:27:35,817 --> 01:27:38,945
Ninety days' time. There's been
no cattle buys and no market at all.

1103
01:27:39,053 --> 01:27:40,953
But now I've got me one.

1104
01:27:41,055 --> 01:27:44,991
Give me 90 days to round up my cattle, collect
and deliver, and I'll have the money to pay you off.

1105
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:47,391
- Ninety days!
- You have no such deal.

1106
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:52,960
Well, I'm a rotten liar, Emily.

1107
01:27:54,569 --> 01:27:57,970
A lie sticks out of me
like a billy goat's whiskers.

1108
01:27:58,072 --> 01:28:00,131
I've got no deal.

1109
01:28:00,241 --> 01:28:05,008
Bailey's supposed to have himself a cattle buy,
but with this market I doubt it.

1110
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:07,104
Give me one more chance at Bailey.

1111
01:28:12,053 --> 01:28:16,114
I think T.C. Can have until 10:00
tomorrow morning. Don't you?

1112
01:28:20,628 --> 01:28:22,528
All right, my dear.

1113
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:25,724
And if he gets a buyer,
you'll give him his 90 days, won't you?

1114
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:27,801
Yes, my dear.

1115
01:28:31,873 --> 01:28:34,398
Thanks, Emily.

1116
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:36,409
- How is she?
- Your daughter?

1117
01:28:36,511 --> 01:28:38,479
Oh, fiine.

1118
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:49,017
If only I could fiind that cattle buyer
Bailey whispered about.

1119
01:28:49,123 --> 01:28:51,250
If only we could float
some more T.C.s.

1120
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:54,419
If only I had a buck
for every time you said "if only."

1121
01:28:54,529 --> 01:28:56,690
Cold, Scotty.

1122
01:28:56,798 --> 01:29:01,064
Can't seem to get enough sun or fiire
to heat me through anymore.

1123
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:04,138
I've got fiive $1,000 bills
in my grouch bag.

1124
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:06,638
They're yours, if you want.

1125
01:29:06,741 --> 01:29:09,141
Howsoever did you get you
the money, Scotty?

1126
01:29:09,243 --> 01:29:12,576
- Where was I when you hired me?
- Just got you out of jail.

1127
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,580
What was I in for?

1128
01:29:14,682 --> 01:29:17,913
Took the next step to being a fiinance genius.
You took outright to swindlir.

1129
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:21,955
Working at The Furies, I just sorta
kept my fiinger in the pie somewhat.

1130
01:29:22,056 --> 01:29:24,286
The 5,000 is yours,
if you want.

1131
01:29:26,394 --> 01:29:29,727
Nah, Scotty, if you was gonna steal,
you shoulda stole enough to do some good.

1132
01:29:29,831 --> 01:29:33,892
Thank you kindly.
Keep your grouch bag tied.

1133
01:29:34,936 --> 01:29:37,962
5,000 would only be
a spit in the ocean.

1134
01:29:39,807 --> 01:29:41,900
Order up some more wood.
I'm cold.

1135
01:29:42,009 --> 01:29:44,239
Still cold?

1136
01:29:44,345 --> 01:29:48,543
Yeah. I been cold
ever since that dawn I hung him.

1137
01:29:48,649 --> 01:29:51,777
Ever thought of asking her
for the money you need?

1138
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:53,854
Scotty!

1139
01:29:57,058 --> 01:29:59,026
Scotty.

1140
01:30:00,328 --> 01:30:02,296
I'll get more wood.

1141
01:30:17,378 --> 01:30:19,403
Flo.

1142
01:30:19,514 --> 01:30:21,482
Supper's here.

1143
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:25,810
Flo.

1144
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,888
Please, Flo.

1145
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:39,332
You said "please."

1146
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:42,062
You never said that
to me before, Temple.

1147
01:30:57,919 --> 01:31:02,151
Flo, I hate a man that's mealymouthed,
so I'll come right out with it.

1148
01:31:02,256 --> 01:31:06,158
I'm broke. Bust.
Flatter than a poor boy's tortilla.

1149
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:09,889
I need the $50,000 I settled on you,
and the jewels and...

1150
01:31:09,997 --> 01:31:12,625
well, anything a dollar
can be raised on.

1151
01:31:12,733 --> 01:31:14,633
What you put away for a rainy day.

1152
01:31:14,735 --> 01:31:16,726
Rainy?

1153
01:31:16,838 --> 01:31:19,238
It's a cloudburst.

1154
01:31:20,775 --> 01:31:24,768
That must have been diffiicult
for you to say to me, Temple.

1155
01:31:24,879 --> 01:31:26,972
Yes, it were.

1156
01:31:27,081 --> 01:31:30,380
Did you really think
I'd come through for you?

1157
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:34,615
Oh, son, uh, step outside, will ya?
I'll give you a holler when I need ya.

1158
01:31:36,691 --> 01:31:39,854
If I gave you the money...

1159
01:31:39,961 --> 01:31:43,419
if you saved yourself with it now,
you'd get rid of me.

1160
01:31:45,099 --> 01:31:47,226
Well, you shouldn't talk so.

1161
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:51,101
You'd get rid of me
because you can't bear anything ugly.

1162
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:55,131
You don't see your face
when you look at me, Temple.

1163
01:31:55,243 --> 01:31:57,211
But I see it.

1164
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:02,145
I thought you were hungry, Temple.

1165
01:32:04,485 --> 01:32:08,148
If you saved yourself now,
you'd fiind another woman...

1166
01:32:08,256 --> 01:32:10,417
one who wasrt marked...

1167
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:13,619
one who didn't drink too much.

1168
01:32:13,728 --> 01:32:16,196
Quite possibly one who was rich.

1169
01:32:18,766 --> 01:32:21,257
In any event, you'd get rid of me.

1170
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:25,465
With this face,
I'd fiind no one else.

1171
01:32:25,573 --> 01:32:28,041
I'm bound to be lonely.

1172
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:34,037
Money is the only thing
that makes loneliness bearable...

1173
01:32:34,148 --> 01:32:36,116
to some slight degree.

1174
01:32:37,752 --> 01:32:40,152
So I must refuse you, Temple.

1175
01:32:40,254 --> 01:32:42,882
I must keep the money I have.

1176
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:47,058
And if that isn't sporting of me...

1177
01:32:48,095 --> 01:32:50,063
I can't help that.

1178
01:32:52,433 --> 01:32:56,062
Well, that's real. It's honest.

1179
01:32:57,505 --> 01:32:59,564
I'm sorry, Temple.

1180
01:32:59,674 --> 01:33:02,074
Yes, I believe you are.

1181
01:33:02,176 --> 01:33:04,076
And I'll tell you this -

1182
01:33:04,178 --> 01:33:07,511
If I ever get any fresh money,
I'll come and bring you back to The Furies.

1183
01:33:07,615 --> 01:33:12,018
I hope you do get money again, Temple.
Somehow I think you will.

1184
01:33:12,119 --> 01:33:14,587
- Well, here's hoping.
- Here's hoping.

1185
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:19,152
Oh, son!

1186
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:22,161
Pour out that wine.
Fill up these glasses here.

1187
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:24,993
- And catch hold of one yourself.
- That wouldn't be proper, sir.

1188
01:33:25,099 --> 01:33:28,933
I said catch hold.
We're drinking a toast to a lady.

1189
01:33:29,036 --> 01:33:32,199
And it's fiittir
all present should join in.

1190
01:33:42,116 --> 01:33:44,016
Come on, wake up.

1191
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:47,019
Come on! Come on!
Bailey's just come through!

1192
01:33:47,121 --> 01:33:50,022
- Come on, wake up! We got a buyer!
- Go on, you old jackass.

1193
01:33:50,124 --> 01:33:53,025
Well, if I'm a jackass, you're my brother.
Come on! Wake up!

1194
01:33:53,127 --> 01:33:56,028
Just got an order from Bailey.
Just got an order from Bailey!

1195
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:59,588
- Huh?
- He's got a buyer for 20,000 head of cattle!
A buyer for 20,000 head of cattle!

1196
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:02,032
- Oh.
- Enough to pay off every dime to Anaheim!

1197
01:34:02,136 --> 01:34:06,038
- Enough to pay every dime to Anaheim!

1198
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:08,040
Have you got 20,000 head of cattle?

1199
01:34:08,142 --> 01:34:11,043
We'll rake out every last maggot
that can walk and crawl.

1200
01:34:11,145 --> 01:34:14,046
Old cimarrons that ain't seen
the light of day for a dozen years!

1201
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:17,049
And them up in them rocks
that are skinnier than a snake's rump!

1202
01:34:17,151 --> 01:34:19,051
We'll round up 20,000 head!

1203
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:22,054
Come on, Scotty! We're paying a visit
to Anaheim, the old wind sucker!

1204
01:34:22,156 --> 01:34:24,056
Toss me my britches!

1205
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:27,685
Yaaah-hyah!

1206
01:34:49,550 --> 01:34:51,518
Hi-ho! Hah!

1207
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:56,657
Hey!

1208
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:13,605
Come on!

1209
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,676
Come on!

1210
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:20,180
Come on there!

1211
01:35:21,315 --> 01:35:23,215
The third horse
he wore down today.

1212
01:35:23,317 --> 01:35:26,718
I tell ya, he must have him
a cast-iron rump.

1213
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:38,926
- Hyah.! Hyah.!
- Move 'em out!

1214
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:55,139
He was so tired, he fell asleep
hunkered on his spurs.

1215
01:35:55,249 --> 01:35:57,308
The patrón.

1216
01:35:57,418 --> 01:35:59,648
He's the best I ever worked for.

1217
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:03,485
He's the best I ever saw.
He's the best I ever heard of.

1218
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:06,185
The boys already got up
a tune about him.

1219
01:36:06,293 --> 01:36:09,194
They'll sing about T.C.
And this roundup forever.

1220
01:36:09,296 --> 01:36:11,196
You heard it?

1221
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:16,098
#Through mesquite and chaparral #

1222
01:36:16,203 --> 01:36:18,535
#T.C. Cussed and fiit #

1223
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:21,472
#And drug them cows
from out the sloughs #

1224
01:36:21,575 --> 01:36:23,543
# Until the cowboys spit #

1225
01:36:23,644 --> 01:36:26,772
## Oh, there never was a man
like old T.C. ##

1226
01:36:26,881 --> 01:36:29,315
## When he was in his prime ##

1227
01:36:29,416 --> 01:36:31,976
##He drug them cows
from up the sloughs ##

1228
01:36:32,086 --> 01:36:34,213
##At T.C. Roundup time ##

1229
01:36:34,321 --> 01:36:37,586
- When I get through, you'll do more'n spit!

1230
01:36:37,691 --> 01:36:40,216
##Swings his boot
and squatters scoot ##

1231
01:36:40,327 --> 01:36:42,522
##Ain't no man to fool ##

1232
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:45,394
##His word is law
His whip is raw ##

1233
01:36:45,499 --> 01:36:47,660
##For he was born to rule ##

1234
01:36:47,768 --> 01:36:51,204
# Oh, there never was a man
like old T.C. #

1235
01:36:51,305 --> 01:36:53,330
- ##A giant in his prime ##

1236
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,670
##His word is law
His whip is raw ##

1237
01:36:55,776 --> 01:36:57,539
##At T.C. Roundup time ####

1238
01:36:57,645 --> 01:37:00,341
 Well, will you look at that!

1239
01:37:00,447 --> 01:37:02,142
The old rogue!

1240
01:37:02,249 --> 01:37:05,082
- Mean as a goat and tough as Mother Lucy.!

1241
01:37:05,186 --> 01:37:07,586
Needle-horned,
and an uglier rogue than me.

1242
01:37:07,688 --> 01:37:11,419
Prancir wild here a dozen years or more -
the king ofThe Furies.

1243
01:37:11,525 --> 01:37:15,188
- What's that?
- I said he was king ofThe Furies.

1244
01:37:15,296 --> 01:37:17,196
- Where's my horse?
- Here.

1245
01:37:17,298 --> 01:37:20,665
- He aims to try to throw that bull.
- He does.

1246
01:37:40,487 --> 01:37:43,217
Hah.! Right there.!
Right there.!

1247
01:37:43,324 --> 01:37:46,521
- Rope him!

1248
01:38:08,549 --> 01:38:11,985
- Right there.!
- All right, T.C.! Let him have it!

1249
01:38:16,023 --> 01:38:17,820
Ah, patrón.!

1250
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:24,630
Go, T.C., get him!
Get him!

1251
01:38:35,142 --> 01:38:37,633
That'll do him, T. C...!

1252
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:39,906
Come on, T.C.!

1253
01:38:57,564 --> 01:39:00,032
I did it! It's still me!

1254
01:39:00,134 --> 01:39:02,762
I'm still king of The Furies!

1255
01:39:02,870 --> 01:39:04,997
I tell ya, Scotty boy, it's an omen!

1256
01:39:05,105 --> 01:39:08,165
It's gonna be all right!
It's gonna be all right, Scotty boy!

1257
01:39:14,548 --> 01:39:16,516
Here comes Bailey now.

1258
01:39:27,261 --> 01:39:30,321
The roundup'll be fiinished tomorrow.
T.C.'ll be here tomorrow night for his money.

1259
01:39:30,431 --> 01:39:33,332
He still has no idea
who's buying the cattle from him?

1260
01:39:33,434 --> 01:39:37,393
He said to me, "By all git 'r go,
I don't know who's buyir and I care less.

1261
01:39:37,504 --> 01:39:39,404
Just let the money be there."

1262
01:39:39,506 --> 01:39:42,873
You've won.

1263
01:39:42,977 --> 01:39:45,741
By tomorrow night,
you'll own The Furies.

1264
01:39:45,846 --> 01:39:48,314
Yes, I've won.

1265
01:39:48,415 --> 01:39:50,474
Congratulations.

1266
01:39:50,584 --> 01:39:53,052
Thanks.

1267
01:39:53,153 --> 01:39:55,144
You should be happy.

1268
01:39:56,323 --> 01:39:58,223
Thanks.
You've done a good job.

1269
01:39:58,325 --> 01:40:01,556
- You know, I'd be happy to invest part of my fee.
- In what?

1270
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:04,392
In dinner for the three of us.

1271
01:40:04,498 --> 01:40:07,558
- I'm not hungry.
- Nor am I.

1272
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:10,398
They say the night air
is freshening to the appetite.

1273
01:40:10,504 --> 01:40:13,405
- My rig is hitched up outside.
- How very convenient.

1274
01:40:13,507 --> 01:40:15,475
And what a coincidence.

1275
01:40:21,615 --> 01:40:23,515
This is a nice, romantic spot.

1276
01:40:23,617 --> 01:40:25,585
That depends on who -

1277
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:34,955
No.

1278
01:40:35,062 --> 01:40:37,292
It's no use, Rip.

1279
01:40:37,398 --> 01:40:39,559
No use at all?

1280
01:40:39,666 --> 01:40:43,067
We'll never have what we could have had,
what we started out to have.

1281
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:45,661
You've changed, so have I -
too much.

1282
01:40:47,007 --> 01:40:50,135
You thought it would be different,
didn't you, Vance?

1283
01:40:50,244 --> 01:40:53,645
You thought that when you'd licked T.C.
And fiinally gotten your revenge...

1284
01:40:53,747 --> 01:40:56,147
it would be
the greatest moment in your life.

1285
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:58,377
- And if I did?
- You were wrong.

1286
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:02,921
Tomorrow night you'll face T.C.
And you'll wreck him.

1287
01:41:04,691 --> 01:41:08,559
We're the same kind, you and I -
we're both out for what we can get.

1288
01:41:08,662 --> 01:41:10,892
And we're smart.
We'd make a good partnership.

1289
01:41:10,998 --> 01:41:12,898
Darrow and Jeffords,
orJeffords and Darrow?

1290
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,231
Oh, funny.
But we would make a good partnership.

1291
01:41:16,336 --> 01:41:20,067
And I fiigured it out.
We -We may as well get married.

1292
01:41:20,174 --> 01:41:23,610
It would be much simpler than drawing up
a 20-page partnership agreement.

1293
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:26,611
- You're wrong again.
- I'm always wrong with you.

1294
01:41:26,713 --> 01:41:29,614
If we marry,
it won't be a business arrangement.

1295
01:41:29,716 --> 01:41:31,684
Come here.

1296
01:41:37,324 --> 01:41:39,485
You haven't changed.

1297
01:41:39,593 --> 01:41:41,823
Don't worry about that.

1298
01:41:41,929 --> 01:41:44,830
And don't ask me
to be your husband.

1299
01:41:44,932 --> 01:41:47,833
If we marry,
remember one thing -

1300
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:49,994
you'll be my wife.

1301
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:52,834
Whenever you're wrong,
I'll tell you so.

1302
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:56,603
If I'm ever wrong,
you just keep you little mouth shut.

1303
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:59,440
Mr. Darrow, sir...

1304
01:41:59,546 --> 01:42:02,777
I hope you can chew
what you just bit off.

1305
01:42:05,819 --> 01:42:07,787
Whoa. Whoa.

1306
01:42:12,726 --> 01:42:17,129
We'll celebrate tonight, Scotty!
By git 'r go, we'll celebrate tonight!

1307
01:42:19,466 --> 01:42:21,491
Come on, Scotty.!

1308
01:42:35,349 --> 01:42:38,750
Bailey, never thought
I'd ever set toe in a Darrow bank.

1309
01:42:38,852 --> 01:42:42,253
The bank happens to be a correspondent
of the Anaheim Bank, and my letter of-

1310
01:42:42,356 --> 01:42:45,723
Enough of this legal mulch.
Let's get it over with.

1311
01:42:50,197 --> 01:42:53,792
These are the purchasers
for whom I acted as broker.

1312
01:42:54,935 --> 01:42:58,200
I've got your signed order for my cattle.
When do I get paid?

1313
01:42:58,305 --> 01:43:01,035
Mr. Bailey, pay him off.

1314
01:43:06,346 --> 01:43:11,113
$145,600 and no cents.

1315
01:43:11,218 --> 01:43:14,517
I assume the computation
agrees with your tally.

1316
01:43:29,036 --> 01:43:31,197
T.C.s.

1317
01:43:31,305 --> 01:43:33,830
Paid in my own T.C.s.

1318
01:43:33,941 --> 01:43:36,034
Hmph.

1319
01:43:36,143 --> 01:43:38,737
Worthless.

1320
01:43:38,845 --> 01:43:41,405
Fit to bed a pup down with
and nothir more.

1321
01:43:41,515 --> 01:43:45,781
140,000, eh?
Didrt know I had that much out.

1322
01:43:47,888 --> 01:43:51,847
That's a heap of money for one man
to scatter about - his own legal tender.

1323
01:43:57,631 --> 01:44:00,191
Lulu of a girl ridir a bull.

1324
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:05,033
I knew it was art, but I'll be double-dogged -
I never thought a girl could really ride a bull.

1325
01:44:05,138 --> 01:44:08,039
But you did it, Vance.
You rode me proper, and you throwed me proper.

1326
01:44:08,141 --> 01:44:11,633
And you rode the seasonal rise
in beef prices.

1327
01:44:11,745 --> 01:44:16,307
Sell cattle enough now to pay off Old Anaheim,
every acre free and clear.

1328
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:19,985
Look at her, Bailey.

1329
01:44:20,087 --> 01:44:23,523
She's smart, and she's a beauty,
and she's full of lick and fiire.

1330
01:44:23,624 --> 01:44:26,024
She's one in a nation.

1331
01:44:26,126 --> 01:44:29,584
I tell ya, no one could have bred her
but T.C. Jeffords.

1332
01:44:31,031 --> 01:44:34,228
You're an old rogue bull, T. C...

1333
01:44:34,334 --> 01:44:36,768
and you'll always prance wild.

1334
01:44:36,870 --> 01:44:39,532
And so The Furies
is in your hands, huh?

1335
01:44:40,574 --> 01:44:43,805
Well, I suppose
that's where she'd best be.

1336
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:46,538
I'm back to scratch.

1337
01:44:46,647 --> 01:44:49,616
That's when I had my fun -
startir from scratch.

1338
01:44:50,784 --> 01:44:52,684
What's your share in all this?

1339
01:44:52,786 --> 01:44:55,482
The Darrow Strip.
It's mine.

1340
01:44:55,589 --> 01:44:58,353
You've ached you a long time
to say that, haven't you?

1341
01:44:58,458 --> 01:45:00,358
Yeah.

1342
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:04,954
And I don't think I'll stop aching
till I have a son who'll own the whole Furies.

1343
01:45:05,065 --> 01:45:07,397
No.

1344
01:45:07,501 --> 01:45:10,402
By all the 12 sons ofJacob.

1345
01:45:10,504 --> 01:45:12,404
I got $100 gold in my pocket.

1346
01:45:12,506 --> 01:45:15,737
That'll just about see us through
the royalest ranahan this town ever did see.

1347
01:45:15,842 --> 01:45:18,072
- We'll start at the Queen High.
- The Legal Tender!

1348
01:45:18,178 --> 01:45:20,009
It's my doir.
We'll start where I say.

1349
01:45:20,113 --> 01:45:23,014
We'll begin us at the Queen High.
No tellir where we'll end us.

1350
01:45:23,116 --> 01:45:25,084
Oh, wait, uh -

1351
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:28,388
Forgot my chore.

1352
01:45:35,962 --> 01:45:38,487
Paid in full.

1353
01:45:38,598 --> 01:45:40,566
T.C. Jeffords.

1354
01:45:41,668 --> 01:45:43,568
There.

1355
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:46,571
Come on, Bailey.
Come on, Scotty.

1356
01:45:46,673 --> 01:45:50,336
We're gonna celebrate,
and we're gonna start right now!

1357
01:46:05,325 --> 01:46:07,725
Rip -

1358
01:46:07,828 --> 01:46:11,787
I know. You want it to be
a three-way partnership.

1359
01:46:25,545 --> 01:46:28,446
Now I'll have all the fun again
of startir from scratch!

1360
01:46:28,548 --> 01:46:31,881
- Arert you getting a little old for that?
- Old? Just the right age.

1361
01:46:31,985 --> 01:46:34,886
Old enough to know better
and young enough to forget what I know.

1362
01:46:34,988 --> 01:46:37,320
Don't think I ain't had me
an ace up my sleeve.

1363
01:46:37,424 --> 01:46:39,324
Scotty's got $5,000...

1364
01:46:39,426 --> 01:46:42,589
and there's an island off the California coast
named Catalina.

1365
01:46:42,696 --> 01:46:45,597
- You've told me about that island.
- Yeah, well, I didn't tell you all about it.

1366
01:46:45,699 --> 01:46:48,600
- You mean a certain wiry little fiilly?
- Where'd you hear about that?

1367
01:46:48,702 --> 01:46:50,602
- No matter about her.

1368
01:46:50,704 --> 01:46:54,105
I tell ya, there's this island there
and it's fiit for a king!

1369
01:47:01,181 --> 01:47:04,617
- Somebody's been shot.!
- It's T.C.! T.C.'s been shot!

1370
01:47:04,718 --> 01:47:08,916
- Someone's been shot.! Over here.! This way.!

1371
01:47:09,022 --> 01:47:11,923
Get Dr. Grieve.
He's in the bar. Get him!

1372
01:47:12,025 --> 01:47:14,926
The old Herrera witch, huh?

1373
01:47:15,028 --> 01:47:18,725
She could hit a pigeon in the eye
at 300 yards.

1374
01:47:21,835 --> 01:47:25,532
And don't you go namir my grandson T.C.

1375
01:47:25,639 --> 01:47:28,802
That's too heavy a pack for him to carry.

1376
01:47:28,909 --> 01:47:31,810
He'll have too much to live up to.

1377
01:47:33,914 --> 01:47:36,815
'Cause there'll never be another like me.

1378
01:47:44,925 --> 01:47:47,485
Scotty...

1379
01:47:47,594 --> 01:47:49,562
will you take him home...

1380
01:47:50,764 --> 01:47:52,732
to The Furies?

1381
01:48:04,411 --> 01:48:06,879
We'll put a great stone over him.

1382
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:10,882
We'll carve the letters two feet high -
T.C. Jeffords.

1383
01:48:10,984 --> 01:48:13,384
He'll like that.

1384
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:15,455
And we'll have his grandson.

1385
01:48:16,690 --> 01:48:19,090
And we'll name him T.C. Just the same.

1386
01:48:19,192 --> 01:48:23,595
## Oh, there never was a man like old T.C. ##

1387
01:48:23,697 --> 01:48:27,963
## When he was in his prime ##

1388
01:48:28,068 --> 01:48:30,093
##His word was law ##

1389
01:48:30,203 --> 01:48:32,535
##His whip was raw ##

1390
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:37,633
##At T.C. Roundup time ####
