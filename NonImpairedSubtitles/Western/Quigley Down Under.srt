00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:03,479
Coogan, Mr. Quigley's luggage.
Take it to the lodge.

162
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,155
Mr. Marston, you said you'd
pay me 50 dollars in gold coin

163
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,949
- just for showing up.
- You don't waste much time.

164
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,201
I spent three months on a boat
just gettin' here.

165
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,331
You intrigued me, Mr. Quigley.

166
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,961
Twenty-one men answered my
advertisement, from all over the world.

167
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,131
Canada, India, England.

168
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,176
They just wrote letters.

169
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:38,556
But you... had a way with words.

170
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:45,813
My advertisement stated that I wanted to
hire the finest marksman in the world.

171
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,900
Have I?

172
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,668
[Marston] Uh-huh.

173
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,255
The legendary Sharp.

174
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,468
You know your weapons.
It's a lever-action breech loader.

175
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:21,224
Usual barrel length's 30 inches.
This one has an extra four.

176
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:26,020
It's converted to use a special
.45-caliber, 110-grain metal cartridge

177
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,731
with a 540-grain paper-patched bullet.

178
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,860
It's fitted with double set triggers
and a vernier sight.

179
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,742
It's marked up to 1200 yards.
This one shoots a mite further.

180
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:46,874
An experimental weapon
with experimental ammunition.

181
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,669
You could call it that.

182
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,672
Let's experiment.

183
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:59,053
Whitey, take that bucket
and ride out until I signal.

184
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,440
Tell me when you want him to stop.

185
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,164
[Sheep bleating]

186
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,333
Your man able to hit
something that far away?

187
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:36,591
I don't know him.
I never saw him before.

188
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,217
[Men chatting indistinctly]

189
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,845
He'd have to be a good shot all right.

190
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,644
'Bout there'll do.

191
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,773
[Men chuckling]

192
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,445
Bullshit.

193
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,219
[Horse whinnying]

194
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,397
[Squeaking]

195
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,420
[Rooster crowing]

196
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,472
Are you quite certain, Mr. Quigley,

197
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,102
that you wouldn't like
the bucket a bit closer?

198
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,277
Jesus Christ!

199
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,028
[Men chuckling and chattering]

200
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,197
Quite certain.

201
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:31,539
[Gun cocking]

202
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,628
[Man yelling]

203
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,341
Told you. Only my Roy could
hit a coyote from that distance.

204
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,514
[Blowing]

205
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,314
Very impressive. You're hired.

206
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,983
[Gate opening]

207
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,073
Would you excuse me for a minute?

208
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,409
There's some business
I have to attend to.

209
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,787
You might find this interesting.

210
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,123
Nice shootin', Roy.

211
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,626
Mr. Marston?

212
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,007
I think there's been a mistake.
The one they call Crazy Cora.

213
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:24,925
[Growling]

214
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,011
I'd appreciate it
if your men leave her alone

215
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,931
- till you and I have a chance to talk.
- Whatever you want.

216
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,184
[Men chattering]

217
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:41,150
You are deserters from
Her Majesty's armed forces.

218
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,778
The penalty for your crime is death.

219
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,697
You were caught on my land.
I could have you shot for trespassing.

220
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,493
Look, you let us stay here,
guv'nor, we'll serve you proper.

221
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,121
Better than this
convict scum you've got.

222
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:58,459
Well, unfortunately, your commanding
officer Major Ashley-Pitt and I

223
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,420
have an understanding,
and so, I'm afraid,

224
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,964
you'll be sent back
to face the firing party.

225
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:08,302
But I see no reason why you
should be trussed up like animals.

226
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,013
Mr. Dobkin.

227
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,501
[Grunting]

228
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,232
This is my preferred weapon,
Mr. Quigley.

229
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,194
Do join me for dinner.

230
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,208
You've got to admit, the Yank's
a damn good shot with a long rifle.

231
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,461
Oh, sure. But you give me
a weapon like that,

232
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,713
and I could beat him with my eyes shut.

233
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,550
Easy to say, O'Flynn.
You've got a lot to learn.

234
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,262
I ain't got a lot to learn. Look at you,
Dobkin. You've been here 12 years,

235
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,806
and all you've got to show for it
is cold mutton.

236
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,808
He's in, getting a fancy dinner.

237
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,810
Huh?

238
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,356
You were actually in Dodge City?

239
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,402
William Hickok must have been there.

240
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,364
Spent a night there once.
I was pretty tired.

241
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:56,076
Dodge City's a nice place
to get some sleep.

242
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,626
Are you familiar with
the army revolver, Mr. Quigley?

243
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:09,423
Well, sir, I never had much use for one.

244
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,719
It's a recent invention of
your countryman, Colonel Colt.

245
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:20,100
God created all men. They say
Sam Colt made 'em equal. More or less.

246
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:27,274
That's what I like about you Americans.
You're people of action, not words.

247
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:31,070
That mint jelly on your lamb.

248
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,031
It's my own creation.

249
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:38,577
No, I'm a student of your American West.
I've read a great deal about it.

250
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,748
Tell me about dingoes.

251
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,128
Ten pounds a month
for shooting wild dogs

252
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,130
seems like a whole lot for not much.

253
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,134
Besides, you got enough men
and guns outside

254
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,179
to kill every dingo
within ten miles of here.

255
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,766
Unless you're talking about deserters.

256
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,022
Did you know that your American Indian

257
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,651
is a race that has no word for "wheel."

258
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,740
No concept of farming.
No understanding of land ownership.

259
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,827
Is that a fact?

260
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:26,333
From what I hear, you found a solution
to that problem in your country.

261
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,838
I guess that depends on
whether you're an Indian or not.

262
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:39,972
You see, in many ways...
our two nations are quite similar.

263
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:45,269
We both brought civilization
to the Stone Age.

264
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:53,152
Unfortunately, in this country
we have failed in one regard.

265
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:58,157
We have been unable to domesticate
the most backward people in the world...

266
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,909
...the Australian Aborigine.

267
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,496
Don't mind him. He's harmless.

268
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,707
[Aborigine voices chanting]

269
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,382
My parents were slaughtered
by Aborigines, Mr. Quigley.

270
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:21,430
They attacked so fast my mother
was found dead still holding her sewing.

271
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,684
Nowadays they butcher
our sheep and cattle.

272
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,395
Her Majesty's government
allows the local settlers

273
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,481
to deal with the matter their own way.

274
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:36,904
It's official policy.
It's called "pacification by force."

275
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,909
But the real issue...

276
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,246
...is that, primitive as they are,

277
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:50,668
the Aborigines have learned
to keep out of rifle range.

278
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:58,842
Which brings us to you... Mr. Quigley.

279
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,598
What the hell?

280
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,433
[Dog barking]

281
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,147
No! Stay right where you are.

282
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,941
[Breathing heavily]

283
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:17,111
No man knocks me out of my own house.

284
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:25,744
[Punch thrown]

285
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,585
Don't just stand there. Get him.

286
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:42,636
- Has he got the rifle with him?
- He keeps it right beside him.

287
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,180
I said, get him!

288
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,619
He's just sitting in there
with that big gun.

289
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:30,642
Keep down. Kelly, up there.
Carver, take the side.

290
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,689
Brophy, around the back.

291

[Grunting]

292
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,075
Fancy American shooter.

00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,914
Eating real fancy, eh?

Go on, kick him in the back! Give it
to him in the back. Go on, that's it.

296
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,643
Leave Roy alone!

297
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,145
Get her off me!

[Men laughing]

300
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,954
Throw him in the wagon. Haul him
two days from here and dump him.

301
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,999
Let Australia kill him.

302
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,711
And that crazy woman, too.

[Quigley] You forgot the gold.

What did he say?

309
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:14,514
- [Quigley] You forgot the gold.
- Marston.

310
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,935
He paid him in gold.

Leave us some water
and you can have the gold.

315
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,258
- I can have the gold anyway.
- That's what I thought you'd say.

I ain't sharing my bed till I'm certain
you know who's in it. Now say it.

481
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:23,128
If we had a wood cabin
we could get glass windows.

The sea's gotta be west.

That's how we're headed,
but you sure wouldn't know it.

Ow! Hell!

00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:56,995
I sure did. Biggest ant I ever did see.

- What's my name today?
- Matthew Quigley,

490
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:05,838
same as any other day.

491
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:09,550
How's about you and me taking off
all our clothes and going swimming?

492
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,347
What are you? Crazy?
There ain't no water.

493
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:19,309
Why, shame on you!

494
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,147
Well, you...
What about last night? You...

495
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:24,565
I what?

496
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,530
Oh, never mind.

497
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:45,377
- How's that, then, Mr. Marston?
- Pretty good, O'Flynn. You've improved.

498
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:48,505
Wear your holster a bit higher,
then grab your gun on the way up.

499
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:51,216
- But I'm faster, aren't I?
- Yeah.

500
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:55,721
- Think I'll ever be as fast as you?
- You mean if you practiced a lot?

501
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:56,889
- Yeah.
- No.

502
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:08,609
Not again.

503
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:12,154
Where are the others?

504
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:15,741
Dead. All dead.

505
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,410
Quigley. He was everywhere.

506
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:24,708
Four more. I don't believe this.
Did you see him?

507
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:28,295
- It was too far away.
- How far?

508
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:31,924
- Three quarters of a mile, maybe.
- That's impossible.

509
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:36,553
How long from the time the bullet struck
until you heard the report of the rifle?

510
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:40,265
Two, maybe three seconds.

511
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:46,897
Matthew Quigley is really
beginning to annoy me.

512
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,444
Dobkin. How many men
can we send out there?

513
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:58,283
These and two others.
Six men are still on a hunting party.

514
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,453
All right.

515
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,749
There's 50 pounds, in gold,
to the man who brings Quigley in.

516
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,378
So keep practicing.

517
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:14,633
- If we're lost, you can tell me.
- We're lost.

518
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:18,804
- I can take bad news. Tell me straight.
- I don't know where the hell we are.

519
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,431
No sense in taking time
to make it sound better than it is.

I reckon we're going in circles.

You flower things up,
I'll see right through it.

So just tell me, honestly, are we lost?

523
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:34,152
No. I know exactly where we are.

524
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:38,407
That's good. 'Cause, frankly,
I was getting a little worried.
