<i>[Narrator] When the territories of
the Great West were thrown open...</i>

<i>men of all kinds rushed in.</i>

3
00:01:15,249 --> 00:01:18,903
<i>Most came to settle peaceably,
lured by free land...</i>

4

<i>gold, cattle.</i>

5
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:25,121
<i>A man could begin a herd
with a maverick:</i>

6
00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:27,948
<i>An unbranded stray
on the public range.</i>

7
00:01:28,035 --> 00:01:31,296
<i>By putting his brand on it,
he owned it.</i>

8
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,992
<i>Cattle barons had started
their great herds with mavericks.</i>

9
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:39,211
<i>Now they fought each settler
who tried to do the same.</i>

10
00:01:39,298 --> 00:01:42,385
<i>They fought to keep the settlers
off the public lands...</i>

11
00:01:42,472 --> 00:01:46,168
<i>drive them from their homes...</i>

<i>destroy their towns.</i>

13

<i>Vast ranges became the
battlegrounds of cattle wars.</i>

14
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:04,693
<i>When the Wyoming big ranchers
found guns were not enough...</i>

15
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:06,781
<i>they used the Maverick Law:</i>

16
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:09,955
<i>A law through which they appointed
themselves commissioners...</i>

17
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:13,696
<i>with power to rule on the ownership
of every maverick branded.</i>

18
00:02:13,782 --> 00:02:17,261
<i>A commissioner's ruling could
declare the settler a rustler...</i>

19
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:21,393
<i>outlaw his brand,
make his mavericks illegal to sell.</i>

20
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,132
<i>Of course, there was no shortage
of sharp-witted men...</i>

21
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,438
<i>who were quick
to take advantage of this law.</i>

22
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:28,612
I know what I'm entitled to!

23
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:31,003
I'm willing to fight for my rights!

24
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:35,483
And I'm willing to fight for your rights,
but you've got to stand behind me.

25
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,396
You've got to put me
in the Governor's mansion!

26
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:42,615
You've got to have someone to
represent you, not just Reece Duncan.

27
00:02:42,702 --> 00:02:45,094
Go ahead, Mr Averell.
Don't let me stop you.

28
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,051
What brings you to town?
Your ears burning?

[Men Laughing]

30
00:02:50,225 --> 00:02:52,877
<i>[Averell]
What is this Maverick Law?</i>

31
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:57,835
The Maverick Law was designed to
protect us all against cattle rustling.

32
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:01,183
There is nothing in that law
that says new settlers...

33
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,922
can't pick up unbranded cattle
and call them their own.

34
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:09,184
<i>When a Cattle Commission was appointed
to watch over brands and cattle...</i>

35
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,358
<i>that was for our protection too!</i>

36
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:14,142
I'd like to ask Mr Duncan
one question.

37
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:16,839
<i>I'd like to ask him
who paid bribe money...</i>

38
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:20,405
<i>to the Cattle Commissioners
to outlaw your brands?</i>

39
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:25,014
<i>To see to it that every time you roped
a maverick it was confiscated?</i>

40
00:03:28,494 --> 00:03:33,450
Just hold it still everybody,
real quiet and still.

41
00:03:33,495 --> 00:03:35,669
Put the gun away.

42
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:39,800
I only aimed to drill his hat, Sheriff.
Just let out some hot air.

43
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:48,192
Keep it there.

44
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,976
I think Mr Duncan would like
a crack at the governorship himself.

45
00:03:52,063 --> 00:03:54,846
Do you reckon Wyoming
will ever have a Governor...

46
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:57,628
who'll take a shot at a man
who doesn't wear a gun?

47
00:03:57,716 --> 00:04:02,283
No... or anyone who carries it
under cover either.

48
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:11,631
- This is a big deal, Sheriff.
You ought to step out of it.
- Everybody oughta.

49
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:15,936
I'm warning you men, this range is taken.
There's no room for squatters.

50
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:19,502
- You started from scratch yourself,
Duncan.
- "That was a long time past."

51
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,981
For you!
But we're just beginnin'!

52
00:04:22,068 --> 00:04:24,633
And we aim to start with mavericks,
and we aim to stay.

53
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:27,939
You'll stay just so long
as you stay within the law.

54
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:32,289
Which means that if I find
any one of you rounding up
and branding cattle on my range...

55
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:34,463
I have the right
to fill you full of lead.

Why? Will you go back there
and gun them down?

Sorry, Jim, there's no money in it,
just a poor, underpaid judge.

126
00:09:26,128 --> 00:09:30,303
I guess somebody oughta give me
a necktie party for what I've done to you.

127
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,782
Maybe somebody will.

But you came when I called you.
You didn't waste any time.

Birds of a feather.

00:09:38,914 --> 00:09:42,348
But that doesn't mean I'll ever feel
the same way about you.

131
00:09:42,435 --> 00:09:44,827
You will, honey. You will.

132
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:48,089
Believe me, that last sour deal
is way behind me.

133
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:51,916
I'm going up... up and up right into
the Governor's mansion.

- To ask a pardon?
- To be the Governor!

135
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:59,440
I'm going to make the whole territory
of Wyoming my own private range.

00:09:59,527 --> 00:10:03,266

I got a big front, but he is big.

140
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:19,009
Sounds crazy, but it's true. If Duncan goes,
I can be Governor of Wyoming.

141
00:10:19,095 --> 00:10:22,444
You will, of course,
drop in sometime for a drink.

142
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,575
And you'll be with me.
That's what I'm trying to tell you, Kate.

143
00:10:26,662 --> 00:10:29,967
I'm going to make up to you
for everything.

What's this other thing about?

145
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,751
Why am I a cattle buyer?

146
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:41,665
You don't have to know anything
about cattle. Don't let that scare you.

147
00:10:41,752 --> 00:10:45,796
I know plenty.
I was riding a cow pony before I could walk.

148
00:10:45,883 --> 00:10:49,492
- What's the deal?
- Duncan again, but you don't
have to know the details.

149
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,580
You just buy mavericks and sell 'em.
Look.

Here's your brand, registered and legal.

K-Bar-M.

152

Honey, it won't be long before people
are calling you "Cattle Kate."

153
00:11:22,456 --> 00:11:26,152
- These three for you, Tex.
- Good! Let's go.

154
00:11:33,849 --> 00:11:36,632
What'll it be, Tex?
Chips or cash?

155
00:11:37,806 --> 00:11:41,154
Chips.
Watch me double 'em.

156
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:51,679
That's Duncan's brand, Wally.

Here's a maverick for you, Wally!
It's a clean one.

159
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:18,467
"For value received, one maverick."

160
00:12:18,554 --> 00:12:21,076
What'll it be?

161
00:12:22,206 --> 00:12:24,164
Chips.

162
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:30,164
Horses comin', Matt.

163
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:39,775
It's Duncan! I'll head him off.

- The Jessup boys are taking mavericks.

These weren't mavericks.
They carried the Bar-Double-Check.

I don't say you didn't lose 'em.
There've been reports of strange faces.

Sheriff, there's gonna be
a range war here.

174
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,656
I suggest you make up
"your mind whose side you're on.

175
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:42,395
I have. I'm on the side
of the first man who gets killed.

- I could knock him off right now.
Why wait?
- Naw.

177
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,050
Save us weeks of work
and put that loud-talking Duncan
where Averell wants him.

178
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:57,051
- I said no!
- Why not?

179
00:13:57,137 --> 00:14:00,225
'Cause Averell said
to let him burn a while.

180
00:14:01,878 --> 00:14:04,183
I told him to come after midnight.

181
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:06,400
After midnight? He better.

182
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:09,532
He does what you say. This afternoon
he could've finished Duncan off easy...

183
00:14:09,618 --> 00:14:12,227
but he let him go because
that's what you wanted.

184
00:14:12,315 --> 00:14:14,707
I don't get it, boss.

185
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:16,968
Abilene taught me something.

186
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:20,752
To wait.

187
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:23,056
We set one side against the other.

188
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:26,188
Prod 'em a little;
first Duncan, then the settlers.

189
00:14:26,274 --> 00:14:28,319
And wait till they
kill each other off.

190
00:14:28,405 --> 00:14:30,623
That's the way to get
things done for you.

191
00:14:30,711 --> 00:14:33,406
In fact, that's the way
into the Governor's chair.

192
00:14:33,493 --> 00:14:36,060
How will that help you
to become Governor?

193
00:14:36,146 --> 00:14:40,798
Look, when times are rough, a man can
make himself a reputation overnight...

194
00:14:40,886 --> 00:14:43,713
that'll spread through
the whole territory like wildfire.

195
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,974
That's if he's on the popular side.

196
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:49,104
And right now I've got these settlers
eating out of my hand.

197
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:53,063
The way you got it figured,
there won't be any settlers left.

198
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:55,715
Now, that'd be too bad.

199
00:14:55,802 --> 00:14:58,890
In that case, I'd have to take
the consolation prize...

200
00:14:58,976 --> 00:15:02,411
and all the cattle and
all the land in this valley.

201
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:07,760

most important men

running the cattle set-up?
- No!

204
00:15:14,674 --> 00:15:19,721
And nobody'll know if you and the boys
keep your mouths shut and do as I tell ya.

Good evening, Sheriff.
Drifting?

Mmm!
Got a nice, clean shave there.

You're keeping the boys busy,
roping by day and gambling at night.

This is a free country.
They work hard for their money...

217
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,301
and they got a right to spend it
the way they want to.

Duncan's on the warpath.
Somebody's taking his branded stock.

221
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,695
Oh, he's just talkin'.
He's got to say that to stir up trouble.

222
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:56,826
No, there's rustling going on.
Got it from the other ranchers.

223
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:02,174
The cows I buy are clean,
unbranded mavericks.

224
00:17:02,262 --> 00:17:06,524
- You ever see a range war?
- There isn't going to be a range war here.

00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:11,480
- A few rustled cattle-
- A few rustled cattle started
the bloodiest killings in Texas.

226
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:16,916
- I was there.
- Oh, so that's where you hail from, Texas.

227
00:17:17,004 --> 00:17:18,612
Mm-hmm.

228
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:22,396
- What brought you here?
- Passin' through.

229
00:17:22,483 --> 00:17:26,918
- Oh, drifting.
- You don't like that.

230

A man knows where he's going.

231

Take a look at Jim Averell.

00:17:35,225 --> 00:17:40,792
- There's a real man!
- I heard him say so.

233
00:17:40,878 --> 00:17:44,227
Kate, you've got a couple more mavericks
in your corral than you had.

234
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,792
- Thanks, Hal.
- Let's have a look.

235
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:49,228
Is anything wrong with it?

236
00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:51,923
No.

237
00:17:53,358 --> 00:17:56,576
- Don't you ever forget
that badge you're wearing?
- No.

238
00:17:56,663 --> 00:17:58,751
Feelin' lucky, Hal?

239
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:01,664
No, I'd like it in cash.
I'm saving.

240
00:18:01,752 --> 00:18:03,883
For any particular reason?

241
00:18:03,969 --> 00:18:08,100
- How'd you know?
- He means it, Kate.

242
00:18:08,144 --> 00:18:10,884
Aw, honey, they all mean it!

243
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,363
Here. One free drink
on the house and then get out.

244
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,450
I need the space
for the free spenders.

245
00:18:19,276 --> 00:18:21,928
Since you're on duty tonight, Sheriff,
how 'bout coming out back...

246
00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:24,104
and letting me show you my stuff?

247
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,191
It's a nice moon out tonight.
Bright enough to read a brand.

248
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:33,628
Well, there they are.
Any of them look stolen?

249
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:35,802
Nice lookin' stock.

250
00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:38,847
- And mavericks every one.
- Lots of'em too.

251
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:42,891
- Is that suspicious,
doing business on a big scale?
- No.

252
00:18:42,977 --> 00:18:45,716
Every one of those cows
were taken off the free range.

253
00:18:45,761 --> 00:18:47,935
You don't have to spit fire at me.

254
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:50,718
My word's good enough for everybody
else, it ought to be good enough for you.

255
00:18:50,805 --> 00:18:54,806
- It is.
- Then don't come with rumours
of rustling and range wars.

256
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:59,719
I'm a businesswoman
giving the homesteaders
their first look at cash in two years.

257
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:04,502
- I don't want trouble!
- There's trouble in the range.
You'll be in it along with us.

258
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,416
Not if I'm playing straight
and minding my own business.

259
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:11,722
My pa minded his own business.

260
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:14,679
We had a small spread
down near Houston.

261

When the trouble came,
he said he'd stay out of it.

The range war
"you were talking about?

263
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:21,723
I was up in the barn
when the shootin' started.

264
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:25,724
By the time I got down and ran for my rifle,
Pa was hanging on the corral fence.

265
00:19:25,812 --> 00:19:30,160
Ma was dead,
lying in the front yard.

266
00:19:30,247 --> 00:19:33,508
- They killed my three brothers.
- Who killed them?

267
00:19:33,595 --> 00:19:36,247
Folks, neighbours...

268
00:19:36,335 --> 00:19:39,032
people who just got so mad
they started killin'.

269
00:19:39,118 --> 00:19:42,511
- How old were you then?
- Thirteen.

270
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,686
Thirteen?
Your whole family?

271
00:19:45,772 --> 00:19:47,860
Is that when you started drifting?

272
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:51,165
Drifting's not so bad.
A man sees a lot of country.

273
00:19:51,251 --> 00:19:53,382
Not anything he can call his own.

274
00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:56,079
Why own something
if you don't need it?

275
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,687
What about marriage?

276
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:02,384
Have you ever thought
about getting married?

277
00:20:02,471 --> 00:20:04,906
Some. You?

00:21:01,831 --> 00:21:06,527
It's the sheriff.
Go get Averell.

283
00:21:06,614 --> 00:21:09,354
You were told not to show up
before midnight.

284
00:21:09,441 --> 00:21:11,528
In this business, you show up when
"you've got the goods.

285
00:21:11,615 --> 00:21:16,225
- How much did he see?
- There's no tellin'.

286
00:21:16,311 --> 00:21:18,747
- Get rid of him.
- For good?

Ever since that Abilene business...

289
00:21:25,052 --> 00:21:28,661
every time you get called out of a room,
I get an urge to follow you.

290
00:21:28,748 --> 00:21:31,618
- Now, what's this about?
- Nothing, honey.

291
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:35,229
This drifter was interfering
in something private.

292
00:21:35,315 --> 00:21:39,881
As a drifter or as the sheriff?
And what jail did you boys break out of?

293
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,403
Do we take him or not?

294
00:21:42,491 --> 00:21:45,491
You leave him alone,
that's what you'll do!

295
00:21:45,578 --> 00:21:50,493
And I hope you're thinking up a good story,
Jim, because I'm getting awfully mad.

296
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,450
Don't.
You'll only come apologizing later.

297
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,754
He's nobody to be skittish about.

298
00:21:55,842 --> 00:21:58,755
Dump him where he'll have
a long walk back.

299
00:21:58,842 --> 00:22:01,016
How do I know
they won't kill him?

300
00:22:01,103 --> 00:22:03,669
I wouldn't trust them
as far as I could throw a steer.

301
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:08,148
They do exactly as I tell them.
Get to it, men.

302
00:22:09,192 --> 00:22:12,322
You like him?

303
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:16,063
No! There's no money
in that kind of maverick.

304
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,716
All right.
Who are those men?

305
00:22:20,803 --> 00:22:24,542
It seems they were running
some cattle into your corral.

306
00:22:24,629 --> 00:22:26,803
- Whose cattle?
- Yours.

307
00:22:26,891 --> 00:22:29,282
Anyway, your brand.

308
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,804
There weren't that many here
a few minutes ago!

309
00:22:34,849 --> 00:22:37,414
That's what I'm trying to tell you, Kate.

310
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:39,241
Look at this.

311
00:22:40,284 --> 00:22:43,415
Here's Reece Duncan's brand.

312
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,590
Bar-Double-Check.

313
00:22:47,677 --> 00:22:50,373
Now watch.
This is clever.

314
00:22:58,201 --> 00:23:01,071
K-Bar-M.

315
00:23:03,811 --> 00:23:07,855
Katie, somebody's apt
to call you a cattle rustler.

316
00:23:07,942 --> 00:23:12,552
- Why you dirty, low-down-
- It takes money to run for office.

317
00:23:12,595 --> 00:23:16,204
You'll never be Governor.
You'll be crow bait on the end of a rope.

318
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:19,336
I'm no rustler... but you are.

319
00:23:19,422 --> 00:23:22,597
This is your brand,
registered in your name.

320
00:23:22,684 --> 00:23:25,163
I don't share the business with you.
I gave it to you.

321
00:23:25,249 --> 00:23:29,686
You're the one who's been
buying and selling cattle.
How do you get out of that?

322
00:23:29,772 --> 00:23:32,381
Wait till I tell Stan about this...
and Duncan!

323
00:23:32,468 --> 00:23:36,643
What if they don't believe you?
Pretty big risk, isn't it?

324
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,818
Jim, what are you up to?

325
00:23:39,905 --> 00:23:42,340
This isn't a big enough
operation for you.

326
00:23:42,427 --> 00:23:45,124
I've told you, we're going to
the Governor's mansion.

327
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:48,428
It's going to take time
and a lot of money.

328
00:23:48,515 --> 00:23:52,472
And meanwhile,
"you'll keep your pretty mouth shut.

329
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:58,082
When I'm playing for high stakes,
I get awfully upset if anyone talks.

330
00:24:22,826 --> 00:24:24,783
Hi, Sheriff!

331
00:24:24,826 --> 00:24:27,784
Maybe you can teach
Knuckles how to ride. I give up.

332
00:24:27,871 --> 00:24:30,741
Come on, you stumblebum.

333
00:24:30,828 --> 00:24:32,742
- Where's Kate?
- Went riding.

334
00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:36,698
Come on, Knuckles! You're not going
to throw in the towel, are you?

335
00:24:36,786 --> 00:24:40,091
<i>[Knuckles]
I'll get a decision over you yet!</i>

336
00:24:48,744 --> 00:24:51,615
<i>[Woman]
Hold on tight, Knuckles!</i>

337
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,659
[Knuckles]
Come on, ya bum.

338
00:24:58,745 --> 00:25:01,399
Hi, everybody.

339
00:25:05,096 --> 00:25:08,096
You look like you
came off second best.

340
00:25:08,184 --> 00:25:11,011
- Third!
- Bet you brought him in,
though, whoever he was.

341
00:25:11,097 --> 00:25:13,315
- No, he's still kinda loose.
- But you will!

342
00:25:13,402 --> 00:25:18,142
- I aim to.
You had a lot of stock in here last night.
- Some.

343
00:25:18,229 --> 00:25:21,012
- How many head
when we looked at them?
- Why?

344
00:25:21,098 --> 00:25:23,534
How many head this morning
before you got them out in such a hurry?

345
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,839
Putting together that question
and that tin badge...

346
00:25:25,926 --> 00:25:27,970
it looks like I'm accused
of being a rustler.

347
00:25:28,013 --> 00:25:32,319
Two minutes after you left last night,
some cattle came headin' for the corral.

348
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,536
Driven by my boys, of course!

349
00:25:34,623 --> 00:25:37,841
- Too dark to see that.
- But you did see them
put cattle into my corral!

350
00:25:37,928 --> 00:25:42,015
- No, I got busy.
- So you've taken such
a personal dislike to me...

351
00:25:42,103 --> 00:25:44,234
that without seeing anything,
without any proof...

352
00:25:44,321 --> 00:25:47,582
- you're willing to believe that I'm a rustler!
- I haven't taken a dislike to ya.

353
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:49,843
Sheriff, I go by actions,
not by words...

354
00:25:49,931 --> 00:25:52,104
and what I feel
when you talk to me-

355
00:25:52,192 --> 00:25:57,105
- Why, I just feel as homely as a mud fence!
- Homely? You're the most-

356
00:26:02,281 --> 00:26:04,410
Women!

357
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:18,111
- What did he say?
- I gave him a line. He won't be any trouble.

358
00:26:18,197 --> 00:26:22,111
That's why he has that job.
That's why I gave it to him.

359
00:26:22,198 --> 00:26:25,764
I took one look at him when he first
came into town and I said to myself...

360
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:28,591
"That's the kind of sheriff
I need: A drifter."

361
00:26:28,677 --> 00:26:32,505
I've got to hand it to you.
This time you're playing it smart, Jim.

362
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,114
It's nice to hear you say so...

363
00:26:35,157 --> 00:26:38,244
except I know you'd like
to see me break my neck.

364
00:26:38,332 --> 00:26:41,289
That would be nice.

365
00:26:41,332 --> 00:26:45,637
Oh, Katie, you're just ungrateful.
Makes me very unhappy.

366
00:26:45,724 --> 00:26:49,856
I don't like the way you operate.
You don't think of anyone but yourself.

367
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,073
What about the homesteaders
in this thing?

368
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,291
How long will it be before Duncan
starts taking it out on them?

369
00:26:55,378 --> 00:26:59,031
- What makes you think
he'd do a thing like that?
- You're hoping he will.

370
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,988
- Why, Kate!
- You want trouble. You want a range war.

371
00:27:03,075 --> 00:27:07,032
You want so much killing that they'd
have to send troops in to keep the peace.

372
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,250
What an imagination!

373
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:12,077
Duncan killed, arrested,
or any way out of the running.

374
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:16,339
And the homesteaders just about wiped
out and ready to listen to anybody.

375
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,513
And who steps up to lead them?

376
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,905
- Jim Averell, the poor man's hope.
- It's a good phrase.

377
00:27:22,992 --> 00:27:26,601
I don't want any part of this.
I'm getting out of here.

378
00:27:26,689 --> 00:27:29,559
You can't, Kate.

379
00:27:29,646 --> 00:27:31,602
How far could you get?

380
00:27:31,689 --> 00:27:34,647
It won't take Duncan long
to trace his cattle to your corral...

381
00:27:34,734 --> 00:27:37,126
and the sheriff to wire ahead.

382
00:27:37,213 --> 00:27:41,300
They don't just arrest you
for cattle rustling.

383
00:27:41,343 --> 00:27:43,822
Jim!

384
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:47,563
This act you're putting on about
not being interested in the sheriff.

385
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:51,693
- Now you're imagining things.
- I hope so.

386
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:55,216
I'm jealous, honey.
Can't get angry with me for that.

387
00:27:55,303 --> 00:27:59,738
Sure, I want to be up there where
I know I belong, but I want you with me.

388
00:27:59,826 --> 00:28:02,130
I'm doing all of this for you, Katie.

389
00:28:02,217 --> 00:28:04,652
I'll prove that to you yet.

390
00:28:04,739 --> 00:28:07,914
But these things need time.

391
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,350
Yes, that's what we need... time.

392
00:28:27,397 --> 00:28:30,483
Get some of the boys
and fix that north line fence.

393
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:32,919
We gotta keep the herds closer in.

394
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:36,050
Jiminy!
Look what's coming.

395
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,747
<i>[Kate]
Good morning, Mr Duncan.</i>

396
00:28:44,834 --> 00:28:47,183
What brings you out
in broad daylight?

397
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,835
I wouldn't mind sitting
in the shade for a while.

398
00:28:49,922 --> 00:28:54,445
- I'd like to be polite,
but I have a lot of work to do.
- My business won't take long.

399
00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:13,361
Not much here to interest a woman.
It's a man's place.

400
00:29:13,449 --> 00:29:16,667
- Oh, that would interest a woman.
- Well, it hasn't.

401
00:29:16,753 --> 00:29:19,667
No wife? No womenfolk?

402
00:29:19,754 --> 00:29:23,539
- I'd have thought otherwise.
- I live alone.

403
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:25,843
Maybe that's why
"you're so successful.

404
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:30,757
- Everything goes into one big ambition.
- "So far."

405
00:29:30,844 --> 00:29:33,757
Miss Maxwell, you said you had
something to talk to me about.

406
00:29:33,844 --> 00:29:35,888
I have: You.

407
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:38,715
I think you're making a big mistake.

408
00:29:38,802 --> 00:29:43,846
No, it's your settler friends who are making
the mistake with your encouragement.

409
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:47,717
Oh, now, Mr Duncan,
"you're a fair man.

410
00:29:47,804 --> 00:29:51,631
Why don't you admit you started the
whole trouble by blacklisting their brands?

411
00:29:51,674 --> 00:29:55,066
If you came here thinking that by
being sweet to me and nice to look at...

412
00:29:55,152 --> 00:29:58,500
- I would become a more reasonable man-
- You are a reasonable man.

413
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,806
You've just never been
approached in the right way.

414
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,416
Miss Maxwell...

415
00:30:08,503 --> 00:30:12,243
I came to this territory as a boy,
a ragged trail hand...

416
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:15,461
without a penny in my pocket
and my boots open at the toes.

417
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:20,026
In 10 years I owned or controlled
most of this valley. If you think
I'm going to sit back now-

418
00:30:20,113 --> 00:30:23,419
Don't holler at me, Mr Duncan.

419
00:30:23,506 --> 00:30:27,768
If I made the mistake of thinking that
"you knew how to play for big stakes...

420
00:30:27,855 --> 00:30:29,725
I apologize.

421
00:30:29,812 --> 00:30:32,725
<i>I was wrong.</i>

422
00:30:32,813 --> 00:30:35,552
- What do you mean?
- I said I was wrong.

423
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,118
I thought you wanted to control
more than just this valley.

424
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:41,205
Why don't you read the cards,
Mr Duncan?

425
00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:43,728
Before long, the settlers
will outnumber the cattlemen.

426
00:30:43,814 --> 00:30:46,293
It has to be that way.
There's nothing that can stop it.

427
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,859
Cooperate. Give them a chance
to earn an honest living...

428
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:52,643
and you'll be the most popular man
in the whole territory.

429
00:30:52,729 --> 00:30:56,469
They'll put you in
the Governor's mansion...

430
00:30:56,557 --> 00:30:59,209
not Jim Averell.

431
00:30:59,296 --> 00:31:03,557
What happened, Miss Maxwell?
You have an argument with him?

432
00:31:06,341 --> 00:31:10,863
Let's just say that I want
to be on the winning side.

433
00:31:10,951 --> 00:31:13,124
Suppose this turns out
to be the winning side?

434
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:16,125
What's in it for you?

435
00:31:16,168 --> 00:31:20,865
The winning side will be the one I tell
the settlers to throw their weight to.

436
00:31:20,952 --> 00:31:25,344
And I think I'll let you
fix the reward.

437
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:28,040
You sound like
a natural-born politician.

438
00:31:28,127 --> 00:31:30,388
It's all in knowing how to deal.

439
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:33,520
- "[Hoof Beats]"
- "[Man] Mr Duncan!"

440
00:31:33,607 --> 00:31:35,911
Mr Duncan!

441
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:38,608
We caught the Jessup brothers
running off with some of our stock.

442
00:31:38,695 --> 00:31:42,695
We got 'em holed up the other side
of town in Pitchfork Canyon.

443
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:47,175
You expect me to throw in
with a bunch of outlaws?

00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:23,833
I'll give you an example
of how a man gets rich.

See that section there?

446
00:32:26,443 --> 00:32:30,053
If I buy that up, I'll control six others
around it because of the water on it.

- You hear shooting?
- Yeah. It's over near Duncan's place.

Blast 'em outta there!

Hold your fire!

454
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:14,844
Better get down. You don't want
one of your own friends to shoot you.

455
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:17,626
Drop it.

456
00:33:17,714 --> 00:33:19,714
I said drop it!

457
00:33:19,802 --> 00:33:23,107
You'd better learn to take orders
once in a while, Mr Duncan.

- They was rustling our cattle.

468
00:34:01,592 --> 00:34:05,201
- A lie! We found mavericks.
- They're not mavericks
when they're on my land.

469
00:34:05,246 --> 00:34:08,116
- We didn't set foot on your land.
- He was comin' from that way.

470
00:34:08,203 --> 00:34:10,507
Were those mavericks part of
Duncan's stock or weren't they?

Them Jaspers were comin' from our herd,

All you know is gunfighting. But if that's
what you want, you can have it now.

Why, it's Mr Averell!
Glad to see you, Mr Averell.

481
00:34:42,818 --> 00:34:45,906
Miss Maxwell and I were talking
about you just a while ago.

482
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,950
That's nice.
What did you say?

483
00:34:47,993 --> 00:34:52,255
Miss Maxwell did most of the talkin';
but I can see she didn't mean a word...

484
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:56,777
saying she might tell the settlers
to throw in with me against you.

all the way.

You won't want to be
seeing him again.

We're short-handed.

What am I?
A marriage bureau?

491

Every time I get a dancer trained,
I lose her.

492

You're sure going to lose this one.

493
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:35,654
You know what you're doing, Myra?

494
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:39,393
I want to see a preacher in this, Hal,
or I'm gonna get after you with a.44.

495
00:35:39,481 --> 00:35:42,220
We're gettin' married as soon as
I get more maverick money.

- Is there going to be trouble hereabouts?

Duncan about losing cows.

- What'd you see him about today?
- I was trying to make peace.

508
00:36:29,317 --> 00:36:32,622
- How?
- I wanted him to look
at this whole thing sensibly.

any good today.

- No, you've-

516
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,455
When you held that gun in his back,
it was being held by Jim Averell...

517
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:04,759
who's lying to the settlers,
cattlemen, and...

518
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:08,150

And then it's Duncan's turn,

Boys, Kate just had a great idea.

00:39:38,354 --> 00:39:42,659
It's the answer to everything. We'll form
our own stockmen's corporation.

552
00:39:42,746 --> 00:39:47,095
We'll register our brands with it,
find buyers who'll deal with us.

553
00:39:47,181 --> 00:39:50,965
If the courts try to stop us, we'll have
an organization to fight back with.

00:39:51,052 --> 00:39:54,922
Jim, please. You're not a cattle raiser.
This has nothing to do with you.

555
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:58,532
Of course, this will all take money.
And it'll need leadership.

556
00:39:58,575 --> 00:40:00,576
I'm going to advance you the money.

without something to line their throats,
would you?

00:41:28,376 --> 00:41:32,116
- Where's Averell?
- I don't know. He left ahead of us.

00:41:32,202 --> 00:41:35,377
Kinda slow for a man

00:41:46,075 --> 00:41:48,988
Sure.

577
00:41:49,075 --> 00:41:52,554
But not the boys.
They like to be paid as they go along.

00:41:54,729 --> 00:41:59,207
It seems to me you go to an awful lot
of trouble just to start a shootin' war.

579
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:03,166
We could do the same thing by nightfall
by riding out and throwing a little lead.

580
00:42:03,252 --> 00:42:07,644
Mm-hmm. That's why it's a good idea
for you to do exactly as I say...

581
00:42:07,731 --> 00:42:10,471
no more, no less.

582
00:42:20,213 --> 00:42:23,474
- Good coffee.
- Makes the best coffee
in the whole dang world.

583
00:42:23,561 --> 00:42:26,040
Learned it from Kate.
There's someone who can cook.

584
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:29,693
Tell him some more.
I need all the recommendations I can get.

585
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:31,649
Here comes Averell with the tally book.

586
00:42:37,434 --> 00:42:39,998
Where have you been?
We've been waiting for the tally book.

587
00:42:40,086 --> 00:42:43,782
The horse threw his shoe.
We had to stop at the blacksmith's.

588
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,655
What's the matter, Sheriff?
Don't you believe me?

589
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,524
Just looking at the white stuff.

590
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:03,089
What about it?

591
00:43:03,177 --> 00:43:06,786
You come by way of Salt Lick Canyon.
Long way around, wasn't it?

592
00:43:06,873 --> 00:43:09,613
I said, what about it?

593
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,352
Nothing about it. Relax.

594
00:43:12,439 --> 00:43:15,397
Here comes the first bunch!

595
00:43:21,876 --> 00:43:24,616
- Duncan showed up yet?
- He'll be here.

596
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:27,095
Sandy, you just standin' around?

597
00:43:27,182 --> 00:43:31,009
- "I need an extra man to look for strays."
- I work for Jim Averell.

598
00:43:31,096 --> 00:43:33,313
You'll work in this camp
or you don't eat.

599
00:43:33,357 --> 00:43:36,401
There's no grub to spare for gunslingers.

600
00:43:39,706 --> 00:43:40,837
I'll help you, Matt.

601
00:43:40,923 --> 00:43:43,185
I said a man to look for strays!

602
00:43:43,272 --> 00:43:45,663
Oh, I was cuttin' cattle
long before I cut cards!

603
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:47,794
Get me a horse, something alive!

604
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:49,838
Tom!

605
00:43:57,318 --> 00:43:58,274
Thank you.

606
00:43:58,362 --> 00:44:01,232
I wouldn't get on that critter, Kate.
It ain't safe!

607
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:03,450
[Whinnying]

608
00:44:15,974 --> 00:44:18,365
- Kate!
- [Whinnying]

609
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:31,586
Bet she'd be real handy
on a homestead.

610
00:45:07,723 --> 00:45:09,724
## [Harmonica]

611
00:45:30,293 --> 00:45:34,468
- Round-up could be finished
before Duncan shows up.
- Not likely.

612
00:45:34,511 --> 00:45:36,903
Trouble is, I hold with the settlers
instead of him.

613
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:39,730
- Makes it pretty hard being sheriff.
- It'll get harder all the time.

614
00:45:39,817 --> 00:45:43,861
- Duncan's not the kind who gives up.
- Maybe I am.

615
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:46,861
I didn't figure on this kind of thing
when I took this job.

616
00:45:46,949 --> 00:45:49,340
I didn't figure on being Duncan's man...

617
00:45:49,428 --> 00:45:52,037
running around arresting homesteaders.

618
00:45:52,123 --> 00:45:57,341
Seems to me the best thing I can do
is turn in my badge and move on.

619
00:45:57,429 --> 00:46:00,038
- Where would you go?
- Yonder.

620
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,517
Yonder! Always yonder.

621
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:06,517
That's no life for a man.

622
00:46:06,604 --> 00:46:09,518
Haven't you ever thought about
sending down roots?

623
00:46:09,604 --> 00:46:13,345
- Staying in one place for a while?
- Reckon so...

624
00:46:15,084 --> 00:46:17,823
when I find what I want.

625
00:46:17,911 --> 00:46:20,607
What do you want?

626
00:46:26,608 --> 00:46:30,566
When Duncan hears how many
mavericks we rounded up...

627
00:46:33,827 --> 00:46:36,784
he's gonna get a real bellyache.

628
00:46:49,178 --> 00:46:50,961
<i>Bar-VRanch, one calf.</i>

629
00:46:53,005 --> 00:46:55,441
Duncan's comin' up Loma Pass!

630
00:46:57,702 --> 00:47:00,702
Get your girls into that tent,
and get in with 'em. Stay under cover.

631
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:03,094
- But I want to be out here.
- Get into the tent!

632
00:47:03,181 --> 00:47:06,442
<i>Off your horses, boys, and into place.
You know what to do.</i>

633
00:47:06,529 --> 00:47:08,312
Get every horse outta camp!

634
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,704
If there's any trouble,
they'll only be in the way.

635
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:14,052
Step lively, everybody!
He's on the other side of the hill.

636
00:47:23,315 --> 00:47:25,576
Wade, hold the men up here.

637
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:41,492
I don't know how far you thought
"you'd go with this fool idea, Averell...

638
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,841
but it comes to an end right now.

639
00:47:44,799 --> 00:47:46,016
Where's that sheriff?

640
00:47:49,016 --> 00:47:51,320
Here's a complaint
signed by Judge Crawford...

641
00:47:51,408 --> 00:47:54,495
to the effect that these men
are defying the Maverick Law.

642
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,670
<i>Serve it.</i>

643
00:48:00,888 --> 00:48:03,931
Seems all regular and in order.

644
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:08,150
Well, Sheriff, I just happen to have
a Federal injunction...

645
00:48:08,238 --> 00:48:11,411
enjoining these men from interfering
with this round-up...

646
00:48:11,498 --> 00:48:13,542
in any manner, shape or form.

647
00:48:13,629 --> 00:48:16,369
Will you serve it, please?

648
00:48:21,457 --> 00:48:23,413
Looks like a stand-off.

649
00:48:25,632 --> 00:48:29,589
That Jim Averell!
Did anybody ever outsmart him?

650
00:48:29,676 --> 00:48:33,763
If Duncan doesn't win by brains,
he'll win another way.

651
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:36,503
Here it comes. Keep back.

652
00:48:38,068 --> 00:48:40,547
That's a pretty clever trick,
Mr Averell.

653
00:48:40,634 --> 00:48:43,331
<i>I'm surprised at myself
not figurin'on that.</i>

654
00:48:43,417 --> 00:48:46,113
I've had it in my pocket
for a couple of days...

655
00:48:46,201 --> 00:48:48,114
<i>just waiting for you to show up.</i>

656
00:48:48,201 --> 00:48:52,159
Cancelling out my court order doesn't
cancel out my rights as a rancher.

657
00:48:52,247 --> 00:48:55,072
You don't know of any way
to stop me from stayin' here...

658
00:48:55,116 --> 00:48:59,509
<i>- "and keeping an eye peeled"
for my own stock?
- I wouldn't wanna stop ya.</i>

659
00:48:59,595 --> 00:49:03,901
Get a little nervous, though,
lookin' at all that artillery.

660
00:49:06,118 --> 00:49:08,379
That's why we brought it here.

661
00:49:08,466 --> 00:49:11,467
You won't need it here.

662
00:49:11,554 --> 00:49:14,467
Pick 'em up.

663
00:49:14,554 --> 00:49:17,554
Duncan, tell your boys
to drop their guns off over in Kate's wagon.

664
00:49:17,642 --> 00:49:19,555
I've got an idea
they wouldn't do that.

665
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,295
I'm tellin' ya they will.

666
00:49:22,382 --> 00:49:24,295
Never had so many deputies before.

667
00:49:28,775 --> 00:49:32,036
<i>Look over there.</i>

668
00:49:32,123 --> 00:49:34,167
<i>I've got more,
but you can't see 'em.</i>

669
00:49:34,254 --> 00:49:36,863
Gentlemen, peace is declared.

670
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:38,516
What about them?

671
00:49:38,602 --> 00:49:43,777
All right, everybody! Over at Kate's wagon,
and drop off your hardware.

672
00:49:43,865 --> 00:49:46,952
<i>You deputies too!</i>

673
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,171
All right, men,
drop your guns in the wagon.

674
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,218
Hey, Duncan?

675
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:19,175
Cut out a bunch of your cows a while ago.
You want the calves branded?

676
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,872
I'll take that as a favour.

677
00:50:25,307 --> 00:50:26,177

678
00:50:26,264 --> 00:50:28,916
Got separated somehow.

679
00:50:29,004 --> 00:50:31,613
- How do you know this one
doesn't belong to me?
- We don't...

680
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,614
so we're dividing up the doubtful ones:
Half for you and half for us.

681
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,180
- Can you think of anything better?
- That's fair enough.

682
00:50:42,484 --> 00:50:45,093
- Acts just like you
when you won't listen to reason.
- Oh?

683
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,747
If you'd settle down
and talk things over...

684
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:52,052
- you might find there's room
enough here for all of us.
- Could be.

685
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:57,095
You're the prettiest little maverick

- For rustling cattle...

- and murdering my foreman,
Wade Burrows.
- That's ridiculous!

- What are you trying to start here?
- Keep out of this, Averell.

I'm in this all the way,

<i>stretched out near a brandin'fire
with two holes in his back.</i>

745
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:25,205
They never gave him a chance.

746
00:56:25,291 --> 00:56:28,509
Wade Burrows was a troublemaker.
It just caught up with him.

747
00:56:28,596 --> 00:56:32,858
- What's the connection with Kate?
- I'll show you right now.

748
00:56:32,946 --> 00:56:35,728
Every time I complained to you
about losin' branded cattle...

749
00:56:35,816 --> 00:56:41,034
"you'd talk about strange faces in the hills,
and rustlers nobody ever sees.

750
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,121
I'll show ya some rustlers.

751
00:56:47,252 --> 00:56:50,991
That's my brand,
the Bar-Double-Check.

752
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:54,166
<i>When we picked up Wade,
there was a brandin'iron under him.</i>

753
00:56:54,254 --> 00:56:56,167
<i>I reckon the killers forgot that.</i>

754
00:56:56,254 --> 00:56:59,342
Here's the iron.

755
00:56:59,428 --> 00:57:01,603
And here's what it does.

756
00:57:04,516 --> 00:57:06,908
<i>K- Bar-M.</i>

757
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,126
I'm takin' you in on suspicion
of rustlin' and murder.

758
00:57:12,213 --> 00:57:16,475
The sheriff's office is still filled, Duncan.
Don't try to do my job.

759
00:57:16,561 --> 00:57:19,693
- This woman is goin' to jail!
- "But I'll do the takin'."

760
00:57:19,779 --> 00:57:23,389
I trust you, Duncan, but you got
a vigilante look in your eye.

761
00:57:23,475 --> 00:57:26,911
He'd put a rope around her neck
as soon as they got out of sight.

762
00:57:26,998 --> 00:57:29,304
Don't worry, honey.
I'll get you the best...

763
00:57:29,391 --> 00:57:32,523
legal representation in
the territory of Wyoming.

764
00:57:32,609 --> 00:57:34,522
By the time these charges are heard...

765
00:57:34,609 --> 00:57:37,436
<i>Mr Duncan'll have to eat a lot of words.</i>

766
00:57:37,479 --> 00:57:41,176
- Am I right, boys?
- "[Man] You bet."

767
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:45,394
Your deputies must be tired
after the round-up...

768
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,655
so I know you'll be glad
if I post some of my men at the jail...

769
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,177
to see she doesn't get away.

770
00:57:56,092 --> 00:57:59,962
There'll be more in jail
when I found out which of ya
have been takin' orders from her.

771
00:58:03,224 --> 00:58:06,355
You haven't said a word
for the last 15 minutes.

772
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:09,399
You used to find it easy to talk.
Why not now?

773
00:58:09,485 --> 00:58:12,617
Talking to you
never helped me before.

774
00:58:12,703 --> 00:58:14,747
What's the truth, Kate?

775
00:58:14,834 --> 00:58:17,226
Is Averell playin' you,
or are you both playin' me?

776
00:58:17,313 --> 00:58:21,618
Things were bad enough in this town
before you came. They're twice as bad now.

777
00:58:21,705 --> 00:58:24,357
You think I'm a murderer
and a rustler?

778
00:58:24,445 --> 00:58:27,706
I don't know what to think.

779
00:58:27,793 --> 00:58:30,707
What's between you and Averell?

780
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:36,230
Too much.

781
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:56,712
Keep your eyes peeled for trouble.

782
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:00,670
Want these gents barbecued
or slow-fried?

783
00:59:00,756 --> 00:59:04,236
Don't get the idea
"you're deputies, boys.

784
00:59:04,322 --> 00:59:08,236
Anything happens to her,
"you'll pay for it.

785
00:59:17,063 --> 00:59:18,977
You might as well catch 40 winks.

786
00:59:19,064 --> 00:59:22,587
- Tomorrow could be a big day.
- I'll stay here.

787
00:59:22,674 --> 00:59:27,022
- You can't help her. She's locked up.
- I'll stay here!

788
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:29,153
<i>[Hoof Beats]</i>

789
00:59:33,936 --> 00:59:36,720
Kinda wondered why
he wasn't around.

790
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:38,895
<i>[Averell]
I wouldn't put it past Reece Duncan...</i>

791
00:59:38,982 --> 00:59:41,808
<i>to kill one of his own men
and pin it on us.</i>

792
00:59:41,895 --> 00:59:44,896
What his second move will be,
I can only guess.

793
00:59:44,983 --> 00:59:47,765
L-I'm too busy thinking about Kate...

794
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:50,114
sitting over in that jail.

795
00:59:52,898 --> 00:59:56,289
[Wally] Seems to me we got nothing to go
on but her own word that she's innocent.

796
00:59:59,073 --> 01:00:02,812
<i>- "We brought in"
300 unbranded mavericks...
- How did it work?</i>

797
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:06,248
Fine. She was so surprised
she couldn't say a word.

798
01:00:06,335 --> 01:00:08,249
<i>[Averell]
Go back and tell 'em to get set.</i>

799

<i>You'll see the signal as soon
as it's light enough to see smoke.</i>

800
01:00:12,031 --> 01:00:15,118
There isn't much hay over there.
You'd better drag over another bale.

801
01:00:15,206 --> 01:00:18,250
Go on.

802
01:00:18,336 --> 01:00:22,860
I say Kate had nothin' to do with it.
She's innocent as a newborn babe!

803
01:00:22,946 --> 01:00:26,425
All right. If nobody'll back me up
to bust her outta that jail...

804
01:00:26,469 --> 01:00:29,557
- I'll do it myself.
- I don't think you'll have time.

805
01:00:29,644 --> 01:00:32,252
Boys, I just got
some pretty bad news.

806
01:00:32,339 --> 01:00:35,557
Sandy tells me Duncan's calling in
every man he's got.

807
01:00:35,644 --> 01:00:40,080
He's getting set for a fight,
and he'll find a good reason to start one.

808
01:00:40,167 --> 01:00:42,472
I'm going out there
and try and talk him out of it.

809
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:46,909
- I never heard of Duncan
bein' talked out of anything.
- Maybe so.

810
01:00:46,995 --> 01:00:51,953
At least it'll give you men a chance
to get organized for a battle.

811
01:01:27,872 --> 01:01:30,569
See that nothin' happens to her.

812
01:01:34,221 --> 01:01:39,091
As miserable a collection of faces
as ever I seen off a reward poster.

813
01:01:39,178 --> 01:01:42,657
What kind of records did you gents have
before you went to work for Duncan?

814
01:01:42,744 --> 01:01:45,832
Smart aleck!
Don't pay him no heed.

All right, men!
Come and get it!

817
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:55,747
That's real cordial, but kinda sudden.

818
01:01:55,835 --> 01:01:58,053
<i>See who's outside.</i>

819
01:01:58,096 --> 01:02:00,270
How do you like that?
They got suspicions.

820
01:02:00,357 --> 01:02:02,793
I've got a good mind
to spill this stuff on the floor.

821
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:14,012
Quiet outside, but I'm kinda dry inside.
Gimme some of that!

822
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:18,317
Just a minute.
I kinda changed my mind about you fellas.

- We did. The sheriff's outta town.

829
01:02:44,974 --> 01:02:46,931
Jim's ridin' up to Duncan's ranch.

830
01:02:46,974 --> 01:02:51,279
Jim found out Duncan's gettin' ready
for a fight. He's gonna try and stop him.

831
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:55,021
- Don't you believe it!
- In ya go!

832
01:02:55,107 --> 01:02:58,239
He doesn't want to stop a war.
He wants to start one.

Boys, I think it's about time
"you knew the truth.

834
01:03:00,934 --> 01:03:03,109
I've been covering up
for Jim Averell in one of...

835
01:03:03,195 --> 01:03:06,109
the slickest rustling schemes
Wyoming ever saw.

836
01:03:06,197 --> 01:03:09,110
And the idea back of the whole thing
is to start you...

837
01:03:09,197 --> 01:03:11,676
<i>and the big cattle raisers
to killing each other off.</i>

838
01:03:11,762 --> 01:03:14,894
I told you she mightn't be innocent.

839
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:17,459
You didn't finish.
We're still listenin'.

840
01:03:17,546 --> 01:03:19,938
Jim's got a bunch of gunslingers
up in the hills.

841
01:03:20,025 --> 01:03:24,243
And one of them, or Sandy, killed Wade
Burrows to pin the whole thing on me...

842
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:26,504
<i>and start this big range war
that he wants.</i>

843
01:03:26,591 --> 01:03:29,896
He sure did pin it on ya. How many times
that brandin' iron been used?

844
01:03:29,984 --> 01:03:34,462
I don't know, but the important thing is
he wants to start a range war.

845
01:03:34,549 --> 01:03:38,506
Boys, I know Jim Averell and you don't.
He wants to be Governor.

846
01:03:38,594 --> 01:03:41,942
He doesn't care how many people he
walks over to get to the Governor's chair...

847
01:03:41,986 --> 01:03:44,116
<i>or how many he kills to stay there.</i>

848
01:03:44,203 --> 01:03:46,291
I don't believe anything she says,
good or bad.

849
01:03:46,377 --> 01:03:49,987
- Shut up!
- Boys, you've got to believe me.

850
01:03:50,074 --> 01:03:52,161
He's got this whole thing worked out!

851
01:03:52,204 --> 01:03:56,858
- What's he doing at Duncan's?
- Duncan's as big a sucker as any of us.

852
01:03:56,944 --> 01:04:00,599
Jim made him want to fight,
and he's gone up there to push him into it.

853
01:04:00,686 --> 01:04:03,208
I wish somebody would get over
to that case of rifles...

854
01:04:03,295 --> 01:04:06,556
<i>and start protecting me
from what's coming.</i>

855
01:04:06,643 --> 01:04:08,774
[Indistinct Chatting]

856
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:28,865
- What do you want?
- I'll talk to you inside.

857
01:04:33,604 --> 01:04:36,953
If you came here to talk for Kate Maxwell,
"you're wastin' your time.

858
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,518
Kate doesn't need anybody
to talk for her.

859
01:04:39,606 --> 01:04:43,041
- She's probably out of jail by now.
- I don't think so.

860
01:04:43,084 --> 01:04:46,998
- I left five of my men there.
- Hope they're alive.

861
01:04:47,085 --> 01:04:49,390
Duncan, the settlers are talking fight.

862
01:04:49,477 --> 01:04:51,478
They're gonna end this
by wiping you out.

863
01:04:51,564 --> 01:04:53,695
Wantin' to won't make it easy.

864
01:04:53,782 --> 01:04:56,348
I'd hate to be around
when she sends them out here.

865
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:59,305
They'll smoke you and your men out,
and knock you over like rabbits.

866
01:04:59,348 --> 01:05:04,916
Maybe, unless I crack down on them first
with a few ideas of my own.

867
01:05:05,002 --> 01:05:06,481
Ned!

868
01:05:08,482 --> 01:05:11,482
- Call the men in.
- Right.

869
01:05:12,612 --> 01:05:17,049
I suppose your story's pretty straight,
Mr Averell.

870
01:05:17,135 --> 01:05:21,093
- Now I'd like to know
how straight you are.
- Use your head.

871
01:05:21,179 --> 01:05:23,093
Why are we fighting each other?

872
01:05:23,179 --> 01:05:25,833
Neither of us really have
anything in common with these settlers.

873
01:05:25,919 --> 01:05:28,876
We live in a different world.
We live a different life.

874
01:05:28,964 --> 01:05:32,138
When the chips are down,
whose side do you think I'll be on?

875
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:34,052
Theirs or ours?

876
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:37,052
You're a real high-minded citizen
to be looking for the governorship.

877
01:05:37,139 --> 01:05:40,009
- I'm for Jim Averell.
- I see that.

878
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:44,227
- So after all your big talk,
"you're double-crossin' 'em.
- That's not a nice word.

879
01:05:44,314 --> 01:05:47,227
How do I know you're not
double-crossin' me?

880
01:05:47,314 --> 01:05:50,272
You don't.
It's a big chance, isn't it?

881
01:05:50,315 --> 01:05:52,576
Which reminds me.
While we're here talking...

882
01:05:52,663 --> 01:05:56,577
- we're giving them
more time to get organized.
- That time's about up.

883
01:05:56,664 --> 01:05:59,186
They want a fight,
I'll bring it to them.

884
01:06:03,056 --> 01:06:05,535
You're comin' along, Mr Averell.

885
01:06:05,579 --> 01:06:09,710
If anything goes wrong,
I'll have you right under my guns.

886
01:06:16,364 --> 01:06:19,930
Ned, get all the hands in from the range.

887
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:23,062
Saddle up. We're ridin'.

888
01:06:29,888 --> 01:06:32,671
- All set.
- All right. Come on.

889
01:06:32,758 --> 01:06:35,194
<i>Get on the horses, boys.
Let's go.</i>

890
01:06:58,633 --> 01:07:01,373
- If you try to stop me now, Sheriff-
- I'm not gonna stop ya.

891
01:07:01,459 --> 01:07:04,416
I'm gonna join ya like Averell's done.

892
01:07:04,503 --> 01:07:07,330
How have you managed to keep
"your outlaw friends under cover so long?

893
01:07:07,418 --> 01:07:09,852
- What outlaws?
- Wanna tell him?

894
01:07:09,939 --> 01:07:12,984
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- The outlaws working for him.

895
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:16,637
- The ones that killed your foreman
and stole your cattle.
- That's a lie!

896
01:07:16,724 --> 01:07:19,594
- If it isn't Averell-
- No use arguing now.

897
01:07:19,682 --> 01:07:22,594
We'll find out.

898
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:33,858
If there's going to be a fight
with Duncan's men, we know we're
going into it with clean hands.

899
01:07:33,945 --> 01:07:37,945
But let's keep it clean all the way.
The first shot must come from him.

900
01:07:38,032 --> 01:07:41,163
And if it does, well,
"you boys know how to fight back.

901
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:43,294
- Here they come!
- Now, remember:

902
01:07:43,338 --> 01:07:45,642
Duncan's boys must be
the first to start.

903
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:56,253
Duncan, you've got about a minute
to make up your mind.

904
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:58,905
Throw in with the settlers,
and I think we can prove our friend here...

905
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:01,471
has been double-crossing
every one of us.

906
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:04,602
Start battlin', and the outlaws
will wipe out the town.

907
01:08:04,646 --> 01:08:08,168
Seems to me a man of your position,
with all you have at stake...

908
01:08:08,255 --> 01:08:12,387
isn't going to let your thinking be done
for you by a $50-a-month sheriff...

909
01:08:12,473 --> 01:08:15,474
a saddle bum who rode
in here from nowhere.

910
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:18,563
What's your play, Sheriff?

911
01:08:26,216 --> 01:08:28,304
You didn't spend much time in jail.

912
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:31,347
Couldn't afford it.
Too many chores.

913
01:08:31,434 --> 01:08:35,304
- "[Men Laughing]"
- Glad everybody's in good humour.

914
01:08:35,391 --> 01:08:38,566
- What's it going to be, Stan?
- We're gonna have a party.

915
01:08:38,653 --> 01:08:41,045
A mite different from
the one Mr Averell planned on...

916
01:08:41,131 --> 01:08:44,263
but he's gonna be the host.

917
01:08:44,349 --> 01:08:46,742
- Get off.
- What for?

918
01:08:46,828 --> 01:08:49,567
The man spoke to ya.

919
01:08:53,742 --> 01:08:58,613
Some odd characters in the hills
are waiting for him to tell them
we're killing each other.

920
01:08:58,657 --> 01:09:00,831
All right, tell them.

921
01:09:00,918 --> 01:09:03,092
I don't know what you mean.

922
01:09:03,179 --> 01:09:05,614
The smoke signal, Mr Averell.

923
01:09:05,701 --> 01:09:09,050
You're supposed to light
that stack of hay as soon as we
start throwin' lead at each other.

924
01:09:09,137 --> 01:09:12,963
<i>Then they come riding in
to take over the town.</i>

925
01:09:13,051 --> 01:09:17,313
- "Light it."
- The wind'll sweep the fire
into every building in town.

926
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:22,705
Hal, get over in the hotel
and keep a bead on him.

927
01:09:22,793 --> 01:09:24,792
If he tries to move anywhere...

928
01:09:24,879 --> 01:09:27,967
- "let him have it."
- Right.

929
01:09:31,576 --> 01:09:33,664
Now light it.

930
01:09:46,318 --> 01:09:49,014
Light it, Jim!

931
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:05,713
Let's draw 'em in close, boys.

932
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,844
- Let 'em think we're in a free-for-all,
and make it good!
- [Shoots Rifle]

933
01:10:16,062 --> 01:10:18,889
[Gunshots]

934
01:10:18,976 --> 01:10:20,977
What are we waitin' for?

935
01:10:22,368 --> 01:10:24,456
All right. Come on!

936
01:10:36,807 --> 01:10:39,416
Rise and shine, Governor!

937
01:10:39,459 --> 01:10:42,590
<i>[Gunshots Continue]</i>

938
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:55,070
- Listen to that battle.
- This is where we split up.

939
01:10:55,158 --> 01:10:58,463
Let's ride!

940
01:11:02,811 --> 01:11:05,420
I left five men guardin' you.

941
01:11:05,507 --> 01:11:09,030
Nobody hurt them.
Their pride maybe, but that's all.

942
01:11:09,116 --> 01:11:13,074
You think I'm crooked and no-account.
You'd put more trust in a lead dollar.

943
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,553
- Who killed Wade Burrows?
- Do you think if I had
anything to do with that...

944
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,424
I'd have left that branding iron under him
like a signed confession?

945
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:22,859
Now you're saying that
Averell tried to frame you.

946
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:25,771
Why should he?
You're working together.

947
01:11:25,859 --> 01:11:29,382
If I talk from now till Christmas,
"you'd still only believe what you want.

948
01:11:29,469 --> 01:11:32,513
All right, go ahead.
Believe what you want.

949
01:11:32,601 --> 01:11:37,253
- But make up your mind quickly.
There's a fight comin' on.
- "[Gunshots]"

950
01:11:51,735 --> 01:11:55,604
You ain't playin' fair, Jim.
You left us no chance for fun.

951
01:11:55,692 --> 01:11:57,605
They're partners, all right!

952
01:11:57,692 --> 01:12:01,476
- I kept trying not to believe it.
- Well?

953
01:12:01,562 --> 01:12:04,824
I've been with ya
since we rode into town.

954
01:12:04,911 --> 01:12:07,564
You- You boys better
put up your guns.

955
01:12:07,651 --> 01:12:11,085
- Why?
- Well, I, uh- l-

956
01:12:16,086 --> 01:12:21,261
Well, look here!
Captured ourselves a sheriff!

957
01:12:21,349 --> 01:12:23,435
You boys had a nice little scheme.

958
01:12:23,523 --> 01:12:25,697
Don't talk! Don't shoot!
It's a trap.

959
01:12:25,784 --> 01:12:29,350
Not the kind of scheme that'd give
anybody a chance, but I'm givin' you one:

960
01:12:29,393 --> 01:12:32,655
<i>A fair trial if you drop your guns.</i>

961
01:12:38,831 --> 01:12:41,092
- We're covered.
- That's it, boys.

962
01:12:41,179 --> 01:12:43,136
There's a bead on every one of ya.

963
01:12:45,571 --> 01:12:47,223
Let's go!

964
01:13:22,795 --> 01:13:27,448
Get that guy in the hotel window.
He's got me pinned down.

965
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:53,510
You stay inside!

966
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,641
Jim, grab on!

967
01:16:37,616 --> 01:16:39,442
Leaving?

968
01:16:40,573 --> 01:16:42,835
Pointing a gun at me again, Kate?

969
01:16:42,922 --> 01:16:46,227
I ought to kill you,
but I'd rather see you hang.

970
01:16:46,313 --> 01:16:51,010
- Now, Kate!
- You lying, sneaking, murdering-

971
01:16:51,096 --> 01:16:54,837
They'll be piling in here in a minute, Kate.
You gotta let me go.

972
01:16:54,924 --> 01:16:57,577
Why?
For what you've done to me?

973
01:16:59,969 --> 01:17:02,273
For what I used to mean to you.

974
01:17:02,318 --> 01:17:04,666
That was an idea I had.

975
01:17:04,752 --> 01:17:07,101
But you were never like the idea.

976
01:17:08,145 --> 01:17:10,884
Well, uh, the good times we had.

977
01:17:10,972 --> 01:17:13,058
We had good times.

978
01:17:13,146 --> 01:17:15,668
<i>Think about them, Kate.</i>

979
01:17:15,755 --> 01:17:18,668
<i>What are you gonna gain if I die?</i>

980
01:17:18,755 --> 01:17:23,104
You'll never see me again!
You got Stan Blaine, and-

981
01:17:25,626 --> 01:17:28,191
Did I kill him, Kate,
when I had a chance?

982
01:17:28,279 --> 01:17:33,279
<i>When you asked me not to,
Kate, did I kill him?</i>

983
01:17:33,367 --> 01:17:35,889
There's another reason
"you gotta let me go.

984
01:17:37,932 --> 01:17:41,237
Look, Kate. Look at this.

985
01:17:42,846 --> 01:17:46,021
How can I believe anything you've said?
The last time-

986
01:17:51,196 --> 01:17:53,197
<i>[Rifle Shot]</i>

987
01:18:12,245 --> 01:18:15,418
- Let's listen to him, boys.
- Thank you.

988
01:18:15,505 --> 01:18:18,115
I think we can
give credit for this to...

989
01:18:18,202 --> 01:18:21,245
<i>Cattle Kate!
I've come to realize...</i>

990
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:25,725
that I've got to consider
"your interests as well as mine.

991
01:18:25,768 --> 01:18:29,987
<i>If you want to make a friend of me,
think of my interests as well as yours.</i>

992
01:18:30,074 --> 01:18:34,943
<i>"The West is gettin'smaller, friends, and I
reckon we've gotta learn to live together.</i>

993
01:18:34,987 --> 01:18:39,814
<i>Now, I'm not the kind of man that'll throw
away the things that I worked hard for.</i>

994
01:18:39,901 --> 01:18:42,032
- Who gave you that?
- He did.

995
01:18:42,075 --> 01:18:45,425
- Where is he?
- Saddling up.

996
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:56,383
Where to, Maverick?

997
01:18:56,469 --> 01:19:01,339
Could be California,
maybe Oregon Territory.

998
01:19:01,427 --> 01:19:05,124
- Do you still think I was
Jim Averell's woman?
- That's how it looked.

999
01:19:05,211 --> 01:19:09,298
Because I cried?
Sure, I cried, but not because I love Jim.

1000
01:19:09,386 --> 01:19:12,256
I cried because when I found you
I realized I was all the things...

1001
01:19:12,343 --> 01:19:15,083
I never wanted to be, and because-

1002
01:19:15,170 --> 01:19:19,431
Oh, what do you know about women
or the way they feel?

1003
01:19:31,085 --> 01:19:33,303
There's a piece of bottom land
a few miles down.

1004
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:36,956
Good for homesteadin'.
Let's have a look at it.
