She damn sure meant it.

164

for standing up to him.

looking a little sideways,

175

176

- Hi there.

182

Wasn't much of a robbery.

183

Got off with just under $7,000.

- Nope.

Let me introduce you
to the bank manager, Mr. Clauson.

189

This here is Ranger Hamilton.

190
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,596
- Ranger.
- Sir.

191
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,515
Can we get a look
at the surveillance video?

192
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,894
We got cameras, but they're switching us
over to a digital system

193
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,312
that feeds into the computer.

194
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:40,148
These new cameras
don't hook to our VCRs.

195
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:42,108
Call over
the Young County Sheriffs.

196
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,319
Ask them if they thought
to hook their cameras

197
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,613
to some sort of
recording device.

198

- Armed?
- Yes, sir. Pistols.

199

Oh.

200
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,829
Faces covered?

201
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,874
Ski masks, sweatshirts,
baggy pants...

202
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,584
- Uh-huh.
- Like them thugs in Dallas.

203
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,169
Tweakers, maybe?

204
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:02,420
Maybe.

205
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,423
A little early in the morning
for tweakers.

206
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,551
Tweakers don't sleep.
They just tweak.

207
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:12,138
They rob drug stores
and parked cars, not banks.

208
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,515

ALBERTO:
Yeah, I'm here, Margaret.

211
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,687
So they bopped you
in the snozzola, huh?

212
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,814
Yes, sir.

213
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,273
Not very nice.

214
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:28,196
I know their faces was covered,
but could you tell their race?

215
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,448
Black, white?

216
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,243
Their skin or their souls?

217
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,496
Let's leave their souls
out of this for now.

219
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:41,668
From around here somewhere
is my guess,

220
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,586
you know, from their voices.

221
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,004
Oh?

222
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,566
ALBERTO: <i>Young County says
same deal with the branch in Olney.</i>

223

224
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,928
Do they have video?

225
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,513
Same deal all the way around.

226
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:58,184
Doesn't Walmart sell all sorts
of electronic equipment?

227

I'll tell you that.

229

- How come?
- Well, they're patient.

230
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,240
They're just sticking to the drawers,
not taking the hundreds.

231
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,701
That's the bank's money.
We can trace that.

232
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,245
They're trying to raise
a certain amount.

233
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:18,455
That's my guess.

234
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,541
It's gonna take
a few banks to get there.

they're gonna be?

they don't know anything.

When's the last time
you saw them?

241
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,581
When we all went to the rodeo
in Stamford right after you got out.

242
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,961
- That was a year ago.
- I talk to them on the phone.

243
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,713
You talk to them on the phone?

244
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,928
- You want a little advice?
- No. No, I don't.

245
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,221
Go see them tomorrow.

246

You got any idea how much
I owe Debbie in child support?

247

to fix that problem right now.

Maybe we should hit
another branch.

we ain't gonna get away with this.

did you agree to do it?

We're just gonna sit here

they rob next.

What would you rather do?

You wanna drive 80 miles
back to Olney

and look for more fingerprints
that we ain't gonna find?

what these sons of bitches
look like?

Or we can just wait here
for them to rob this bank,

He robbed them banks
because he liked it.

But not you.

1266
01:33:04,955 --> 01:33:06,957
There's nothing new
around here...

1267
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:11,086
except them pumpjacks.

1268
01:33:11,253 --> 01:33:12,838
Each one of them
making you a month

1269
01:33:13,004 --> 01:33:16,258
what you and your brother stole
from all four banks combined.

1270
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:19,302
Help me understand, then.

1271
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:24,349
Help me understand
why four people died...

1272
01:33:26,143 --> 01:33:29,938
so you could steal money
that it don't seem you've spent,

1273
01:33:30,105 --> 01:33:32,190
that it don't seem you need.

1274
01:33:32,357 --> 01:33:33,441
You got a family?

1275
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:35,902
My partner had a family.
A big one.

1276
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:38,905
They don't got no pumpjacks
in their backyard.

1277
01:33:39,072 --> 01:33:41,408
- I didn't kill your friend.
- Yes, you did.

1278
01:33:42,909 --> 01:33:44,953
By setting this thing
in motion.

1279
01:33:46,163 --> 01:33:49,332
You expect me to believe
your dimwitted brother planned this?

1280
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:53,587
Oh, no.
This was smart.

1281
01:33:53,753 --> 01:33:54,963
This was you.

1282
01:33:58,842 --> 01:34:00,635
I've been poor my whole life.

1283
01:34:04,306 --> 01:34:06,725
So were my parents,
their parents before them.

1284
01:34:09,102 --> 01:34:10,604
It's like a disease...

1285
01:34:12,314 --> 01:34:15,275
passing from generation to generation,
becomes a sickness.

1286
01:34:15,442 --> 01:34:16,526
That's what it is.

1287
01:34:18,361 --> 01:34:20,030
Infects every person you know...

1288
01:34:21,239 --> 01:34:22,699
but not my boys.

1289
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:25,702
Not anymore.

1290
01:34:29,456 --> 01:34:30,749
This is theirs now.

1291
01:34:35,253 --> 01:34:37,088
Now, I ain't never killed
no one in my life,

1292
01:34:37,255 --> 01:34:40,258
but if you want me to start with you,
let's get on with it, old man.

1293
01:34:42,052 --> 01:34:45,096
See if you can grab that pistol
before I blast you off this porch.

1294
01:35:09,412 --> 01:35:10,830
(UNCOCKS RIFLE)

1295
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:26,388
- Howdy.
- What's going on?

1296
01:35:28,056 --> 01:35:30,517
The hogs are back
in the garden.

1297
01:35:30,684 --> 01:35:33,144
Feral hogs tearing up this place
something fierce.

1298
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:35,939
Who's this?

1299
01:35:36,106 --> 01:35:37,857
I'm an old friend
of your husband.

1300
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,110
Ex-husband.

1301
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:43,405
I'm just working on the house.

1302
01:35:44,531 --> 01:35:46,241
Oh, you don't live here?

1303
01:35:46,408 --> 01:35:49,202
No, it's not mine.
It's theirs.

1304
01:35:51,788 --> 01:35:53,373
Oh.
(CHUCKLES)

1305
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:55,959
The things we do
for our kids, huh?

1306
01:35:58,545 --> 01:35:59,587
Well...

1307
01:36:01,631 --> 01:36:02,799
I best be going.

1308
01:36:02,966 --> 01:36:04,092
Ma'am.

1309
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:06,052
Me, too, Debbie.
I'm gonna wash up,

1310
01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:08,847
be back around 9:00 tomorrow
to finish the front.

1311
01:36:09,014 --> 01:36:10,134
Start painting the extension

1312
01:36:10,265 --> 01:36:11,575
and then help Randy
with his homework

1313
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:14,477
when he gets back
from school, okay?

1314
01:36:14,644 --> 01:36:15,687
Okay.

1315
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:20,233
Hey.

1316
01:36:21,484 --> 01:36:23,403
I rent a little house in town.

1317
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,174
If you wanna stop by
and finish this conversation,

1318
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:28,408
you're welcome anytime.

1319
01:36:29,868 --> 01:36:31,369
Oh, I'd like that.

1320
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:33,663
I'll be seeing you.

1321
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:36,583
Yeah.
Soon, I hope.

1322
01:36:39,085 --> 01:36:40,545
I'm ready to be done
with this.

1323
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:42,839
You'll never be done with it
no matter what.

1324
01:36:43,006 --> 01:36:45,550
It's gonna haunt you, son,
for the rest of your days.

1325
01:36:46,593 --> 01:36:48,345
But you won't be alone.

1326
01:36:48,511 --> 01:36:50,055
It's gonna haunt me, too.

1327
01:36:50,221 --> 01:36:52,307
If you stop by,
maybe I'll give you peace.

1328
01:36:52,474 --> 01:36:56,353
Maybe.
Maybe I'll give it to you.

1329
01:37:06,571 --> 01:37:09,491
