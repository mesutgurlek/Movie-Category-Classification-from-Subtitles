1
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:30,012
<i>While the Civil War raged</i>
<i>between the North and South...</i>

2
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,251
<i>there swept across the border</i>
<i>from Missouri...</i>

3
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:33,815
<i>into the free state of Kansas...</i>

4
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:35,986
<i>a renowned force of guerrilla troops...</i>

5
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:37,859
<i>led by a Confederate officer.</i>

6
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,558
<i>Unbeknownst to the men</i>
<i>who blindly followed him...</i>

7
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:44,694
<i>this leader was</i>
<i>no longer considered a legitimate soldier...</i>

8
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,338
<i>by either the South or the North.</i>

9
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,708
<i>He was William Clarke Quantrill...</i>

10
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:52,744
<i>jayhawker, border ruffian, freebooter.</i>

11
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,770
<i>His destination:</i>

12
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,976
Lawrence! On to Lawrence!

13
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:09,689
That's Quantrill! Get out of sight, Mr. Travis.

14
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:12,388
Come on!

15
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:23,730
What have you got, Lieutenant?

16
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:26,328
Fifty fresh horses
in a pasture quarter of a mile south.

17
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,772
Guns and ammunition
are in the basement of a store...

18
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,638
being held for a new company of recruits.

19
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,701
Dead men can't use them.
What about the lists?

20
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:36,237
Here they are.
The men you wanted, and where they live.

21
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:40,744
Todd!

22
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,330
Run down every man on this list
and kill him.

23
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,797
With pleasure. Come on.

24
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,857
- You're not taking any prisoners?
- No.

25
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,970
- Any money in there?
- $10,000 in gold.

26
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,198
Break it in.

27
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:07,737
Break it down.

28
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,184
That's Martin. He runs this line.

29
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,684
- Mr. Travis.
- Open the safe.

30
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,657
You came here as a friend.

31
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,324
- Heaven help your treacherous soul.
- Jim, don't.

32
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:32,470
You ride with this madman,
this guerrilla, to rob, burn...

33
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,665
torture and murder defenseless people.

34
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:37,568
- I'm a soldier. It's war.
- War!

35
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:41,439
The Confederates don't recognize Quantrill
as part of the Southern Army.

36
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,172
And the North will hang him on sight
as an outlaw!

37
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,318
Shut up and open that safe!

38
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,482
Do it, Jim.

39
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,281
- No, I won't. It won't save me.
- You must.

40
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,160
Enough.

41
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:05,861
Break it open.

42
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,503
You've eaten at my table, spy.

43
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,982
It wasn't part of the plan to murder civilians.

44
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,680
Civilians? Yankee Free-Soilers.

45
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,526
You've done well, Lieutenant.
You'll share in the glory.

46
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,654
Take whatever you want from this town.

47
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,130
Mrs. Martin, please go.

48
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,499
There's no help.

49
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:46,444
Remember this day, Travis.
Remember it well.

50
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,861
Tell Quantrill to get himself another spy.

51
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,269
Now turn those horses loose
that Lt. Travis found. Hurry.

52
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,901
Since the Yankees won this war...

53
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:28,174
this rabble has been
overrunning these riverboats.

54
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,550
That'll cost you another $200.

55
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,057
Not for me.

56
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:47,928
- $200, and $300 better.
- Jeff. Quit bluffing. I'm calling you.

57
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,266
- Can you beat two big sevens?
- Easily, with two little nines.

58
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:55,999
- I threw away three tens!
- I had a low straight. The pot was mine.

59
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,802
Need some money? Some help?

60
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:04,014
In a game with you, anyone'll need help.
How about dealing me a good hand?

61
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,712
Not a chance. I'm out to break you.

62
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,048
That's a dirty trick to do to an old friend.

63
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,020
In a card game, I don't have any friends.

64
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,592
And neither do you.

65
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,897
- You're playing like a rube.
- A man is only as good as his cards.

66
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,327
You always played a much better hand
when you were holding nothing.

67
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,803
- What's on your mind tonight?
- Nothing.

68
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:31,166
I open.

69
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,507
Thinking of Lawrence again, huh?

70
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,310
It's all over, Jeff. Forget it.

71
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,951
All right, it's forgotten. Just like that.

72
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,747
Lawrence, Kansas.

73
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,013
It was Quantrill's biggest day.

74
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:48,024
I'll never forget it. Nobody'll forget.

75
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,358
That is, nobody who is still alive.
They looted and burned the town.

76
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:56,231
Quantrill and his men slaughtered 150.
Women and children, too.

77
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,136
And all because of the work of one spy.

78
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,302
Ever met a Quantrill man, lady?

79
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,776
Look, friend, why don't you
take your talk somewhere else?

80
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,507
Quantrill's dead
along with everything that went with him.

81
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,049
- The war is over.
- This wasn't war.

82
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,517
They were thieves,
cutthroats and murderers.

83
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,044
What do you say, mister?

84
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:19,349
I'd like to run into the man
that set up that massacre.

85
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,459
Think you'd know him if you saw him again?

86
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,653
Sure, I'd know him.

87
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,389
What difference does it make now?

88
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,693
He was only a soldier
doing what he had to do.

89
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,860
I was in the room with him
when Quantrill murdered my best friend.

90
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:33,463
I could never forget him.
He's sitting there now, the spy.

91
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,851
Let's go outside. They won't dare follow us.

92
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,920
Dirty, filthy spy.

93
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,408
Jeff, get over the side now.

94
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:48,672
Go to Jules Mourret,
Prescott, Arizona territory.

95
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,682
- Get back inside.
- Please, Jeff. Go!

96
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,082
I can't leave.
Somebody'll have to answer questions.

97
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,882
Questions! You're a Quantrill Raider
who killed two men.

98
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,582
- But l...
- There'll be a Yankee judge...

99
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,023
and a Yankee jury.
What chance have you got?

100
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:04,190
- Please, Jeff, go. I'll catch up with you later.
- Don't follow me, Josie.

101
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,433
Did you see him? Where is he?

102
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,158
Who?

103
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,967
- Where are those Army wagons going?
- Prescott ain't the capital no more.

104
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,662
They're moving
all the territorial papers to Phoenix.

105
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,329
This town got too rough for them.

106
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:47,997
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> bluejackets!

107
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,805
- Take your good government to Tucson!
- Come back when you get your furlough!

108
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:54,772
We're wide open now!

109
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,633
Mr. Conroy, another holdup.

110
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:54,437
- Good work, Jake. You got through anyway.
- That ain't good.

111
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,076
- I should of bagged one of them bandits.
- I'm glad they didn't hurt you.

112
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,168
Thanks.

113
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:04,777
- This town is a disgrace to everyone in it.
- We all know, but it takes time, Shelby.

114
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,976
- Things will change some day.
- But when? All we do is talk.

115
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:09,714
Nobody has the courage to do anything.

116
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,417
We're controlled by riffraff
and it's getting worse.

117
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,051
Don't worry about it, honey.
We've held our own so far.

118
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,958
But how long can we keep on doing it?

119
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:20,297
- The stage was just robbed.
- That's the second time this week.

120
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,630
You wouldn't get me to ride on that stage.

121
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,261
Funny thing, they don't touch
the people on that stage.

122
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,375
I'm sorry they made me
throw off the strongbox, Mr. Conroy.

123
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:35,277
- Nothing in it but rocks.
- Get me that carpetbag, will you?

124
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,325
Mr. Conroy.

125
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,963
Mr. Conroy. You got rocks in there, too?

126
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,967
No. This is full of newly-minted coins.

127
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:59,436
Ain't that mighty careless
carrying around a fortune in an old bag?

128
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:03,441
No, it's safer. That's why we never tell you
where we hide the gold every trip.

129
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,636
- And we fooled them again.
- Yes, sir.

130
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,436
Never tell me where you put the gold.

131
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,142
What I don't know,
nobody can squeeze it out of me.

132
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,061
Mister.
I feel bad about spooking your horse.

133
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,529
Maybe I could buy you
a drink or something to fix it?

134
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,033
- Not just now, thanks.
- You're a stranger around here.

135
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,365
- My name is Jake. Jake Hooper.
- Is it?

136
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,302
How do like this town?

137
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:41,138
- Kind of wild.
- No. This is tame. Only one killing last week.

138
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,237
Not too bad.

139
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,839
That ain't good.
They moved the state capital out today.

140
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,977
- Ain't no place for an honest man now.
- Then why do you stay here?

141
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,250
It's comforting to know you live in
a town that can't get no worse.

142
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,915
- Gonna put up at the Juniper?
- Yup.

143
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:57,292
That's the best place in town, Mr<i>...</i>
I didn't get your name.

144
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,352
That's right.

145
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,558
Gabby sort of a feller.

146
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:49,103
Can I interest you
in a game of chance, stranger?

147
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,341
No, thanks, I<i>...</i>

148
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,907
Where does a fellow go
to get a room around here?

149
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,013
Over there, the man in the fancy vest.

150
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,729
- I'd like to have a room.
- The $1.50 or the up?

151
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,807
- The $1.50.
- You'll have Room 230.

152
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,406
You can get your key
off the peg in the lobby.

153
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:21,907
Mr. John Smith.

154
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,346
You've certainly got a lot
of relatives around here.

155
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,782
I come from a big family.
You know Jules Mourret?

156
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,980
He owns this place and a piece of most
everything else around here.

157
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,922
- How do people feel about him?
- Some like him and some don't.

158
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,790
- Where do you stand?
- He owns this place.

159
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:38,655
- I'm looking for him.
- Try his room. 201.

160
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:39,720
201.

161
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,162
Pay for the first day, please.

162
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,700
He's the thirteenth John Smith
in this house now.

163
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,868
I hope he ain't superstitious.

164
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,216
- Mr. Mourret?
- No.

165
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:07,523
- I was told to see him here.
- You can wait. He'll be along.

166
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:21,940
- You ride a careless horse, mister.
- The way you ride, you'd better walk.

167
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,280
Don't ever do that to me again.

168
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,984
Hold it.

169
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:53,233
Such lack of hospitality. Let him go.

170
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,800
I must apologize for my men.

171
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,934
But we both know that civilization ends
with the Mason-Dixon Line.

172
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,707
- We were getting acquainted.
- You can't get away with that.

173
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,974
Neither will you.

174
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:05,744
I sent you for gold, Slager.
You brought me back rocks.

175
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,547
Come in, Lt. Travis.

176
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,128
Take a chair.

177
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,562
Too bad Josie isn't here.

178
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,396
Old friend of mine, you know.

179
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,536
On the boat. You threw the knife.

180
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:34,034
Could I stand by and let
an old comrade-at-arms be slaughtered?

181
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,247
You don't remember how
we routed them at Lawrence?

182
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,376
We fought under the same flag.

183
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:44,218
And under the greatest leader,
William Clarke Quantrill.

184
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,280
There are two schools of thought on that.

185
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,792
So, in a way, I owe my life to the Raiders.

186
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,860
No. You owe it to me.

187
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,757
And I know a good gambler
always pays his debts.

188
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,895
- There's a payoff, huh?
- There's always a payoff.

189
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:02,006
- That depends.
- I have a job for you.

190
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:05,170
A job for which you have unusual talent.

191
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,869
Here's to it.

192
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,811
- Jules. Degas is coming up.
- Jules, old friend.

193
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,178
What make you so nervous?

194
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,220
You jump so<i>...</i>

195
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,551
Your manners, Degas.

196
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,727
- Don't you ever knock?
- No.

197
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,127
I'm always surprise. I just sneak in.

198
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,064
Now we talk.

199
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,827
This is Shorty, my partner.

200
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,696
Listen, he don't talk good English like me.

201
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,868
- Is that right, Shorty?
- Yep.

202
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,305
Who's he?

203
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,772
Just a stranger.

204
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,276
No more?

205
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,475
It isn't your business, is it?

206
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,945
He's not afraid!

207
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,252
The man talks back!

208
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:57,827
But he don't carry any guns.
What do you think about it, Shorty?

209
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,090
He'd get riddled.

210
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,022
Riddled?

211
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,631
Oh, boy, he get killed!

212
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,399
You friend of my old friend.

213
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,169
I make you a little present.

214
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:16,142
- You need it.
- When I feel the need, I'll carry a gun.

215
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:19,750
Come on, take it...

216
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,420
stick it in your pocket.

217
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,412
You never know.

218
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,114
Thanks.

219
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:29,783
All right.

220
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:33,631
Now, Jules, for why I come to see you.

221
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,363
Last night, one of my boys...

222
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,994
my good old friend, Kansas. He was in town.

223
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,963
Have a little fun.

224
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,737
And he don't come back.

225
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,310
- You think he's here?
- Where else?

226
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:51,179
Kurth, bring Kansas in.

227
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,102
There's your man, Degas.
If you still want him.

228
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,605
And there's the knife
he tried to stick in my back.

229
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:28,446
- You push me too hard, Jules.
- You know your place.

230
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,782
Don't interfere
with my operations in this town.

231
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,121
- But we was in here first.
- But now I'm in and you're out.

232
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:38,791
Get back to the hills
and take that scum with you.

233
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,659
Here, take it back.
You may need this one, too.

234
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,797
I have plenty more.

235
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:48,737
Next time we meet, maybe you need it.

236
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,636
Come on.

237
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,243
One of the minor problems
I have to contend with.

238
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,944
But Degas is nothing to my real problem.

239
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,484
I intend to leave Prescott a millionaire.

240
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,116
- You've set your sights pretty high.
- Yeah.

241
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:10,552
Millions of dollars in raw gold
flow through this town from the mines.

242
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,893
I intend to divert part of the flow.

243
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:15,398
Every ounce of it moves out
on Conroy's stage line...

244
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,163
and Mr. Conroy has
an annoying way of hiding...

245
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,227
when and how the gold is shipped.

246
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:23,433
Now, the eyes you used
for Quantrill at Lawrence...

247
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,100
should do as sharp a job here.

248
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,734
I'd like to get one thing straight.

249
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:30,748
When I realized what Quantrill was,
I left the Raiders, joined the Confederacy...

250
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:31,805
and fought in the open.

251
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,852
It didn't help much. We lost the war anyway.

252
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,421
Lee surrendered, but I never will.

253
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,952
The Yankees ruined the South.
Now they're looting it.

254
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,154
So you're doing some looting on your own.

255
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:47,390
Taking Yankee gold
is legitimate business to me.

256
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,662
Now get yourself settled.

257
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:54,001
I'll see you tomorrow. And by the way,
you'll use the name Mark Stone.

258
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:57,073
Mark Stone. You know, Mourret...

259
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:02,372
I think you'd steal Conroy's gold
even though it wasn't for the South.

260
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,563
- What do you think of the tall man?
- I don't like him.

261
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,135
Be sure he doesn't take a dislike to you.

262
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,784
Dad. Mark Stone,
from the Collier Detective Agency.

263
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,615
Our Chicago office, sir,
notified the Western Division...

264
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,181
that you had written for an agent.

265
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,785
That was many weeks ago, Mr. Stone.
Why all the delay?

266
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:54,263
I was on assignment on the Rio Paso.
I had to finish that job first.

267
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,959
Didn't they tell you
how this town is being strangled?

268
00:23:57,035 --> 00:24:00,266
Not all of it, but from what I've seen,
I've an idea what's going on.

269
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:02,431
These robberies are
costing us more than money.

270
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:05,032
They're killing transportation, our lifeline.

271
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,409
Now that the government's moved,
decent people are starting to leave.

272
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,671
There are times when it's wiser to get out.

273
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:15,009
That's strange talk from a man we hoped
would stop these outlaws.

274
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,283
Perhaps it doesn't mean anything to him,
as long as he gets paid.

275
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:20,486
Wait a minute, Miss Conroy.

276
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,618
I was wondering why
you should stick around...

277
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:24,457
on the chance of getting yourself hurt.

278
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:28,163
You don't understand, Mr. Stone.
This is our home. We live here.

279
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,167
I was born in Arizona territory.

280
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,226
Dad's given
everything he has to this country.

281
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,498
My mother gave her life.

282
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:37,406
Now this country owes us something,
and we just can't be driven out that easily.

283
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,907
No, I guess not.

284
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,340
You'll have to give me
a free hand, Mr. Conroy.

285
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:46,349
- Anything you want.
- Put me on the books as a shotgun guard.

286
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,443
It's best that no one knows
what I'm here for.

287
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:52,689
- Of course.
- I'll do my best to help you both. Good day.

288
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,361
I like him.

289
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,501
Got a match?

290
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:14,411
- What's going on? Any trouble?
- None.

291
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:17,480
What happened to Mark Stone,
the real owner of that letter?

292
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,846
There was none.

293
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:23,251
We intercepted Conroy's letter to the agency
and forged identification papers.

294
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,513
We'll have some fast action now.

295
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,058
I'm afraid you'll
have to wait till I learn something.

296
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,856
You've already wasted
three days before even seeing Conroy.

297
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,556
I had to do some planning.

298
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:35,293
I've found that, in playing
for big stakes, Mr. Mourret...

299
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,461
you'd better make sure
you hold the right cards.

300
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:55,380
Thank you, Mr. Degas,
for making the trip seem...

301
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:57,751
very short and very interesting.

302
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,648
I am very happy you enjoy me, <i>senora.</i>

303
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,122
We make another long trip soon.

304
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:08,698
- I'll make it even more beautiful for you.
- No, thank you.

305
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:11,167
And you shouldn't play
with those guns like that.

306
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,933
- You had me worried.
- lf I worry you...

307
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,764
I shall cut off this hand right away.

308
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:21,471
Please wait till after supper.
Where's the hotel?

309
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:24,344
I take you myself to the Juniper House.

310
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,475
Take the lady's bags.

311
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:31,454
Why do I have to work
while you get the girl?

312
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,687
'Cause I'm a gentleman! You're a foreigner.

313
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:55,903
This Juniper House.
I hope it has plenty of hot water.

314
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,549
Sure. Very fancy.

315
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:03,045
They have plenty of water.
You have a nice cleanup.

316
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:07,022
But the boss, Mourret. He's a pig of a<i>...</i>

317
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:11,960
Jules! My old friend.

318
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:13,956
Are you wait to greet me?

319
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:19,361
- What were you doing on that coach?
- Go to Tucson. Buy clothes.

320
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,400
Fancy, no?

321
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,502
How you like it, stranger?

322
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,905
That woman. Where did you meet her?

323
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,607
In Tucson, we make friends quick.

324
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:34,577
She loves to ride in the stage with me.

325
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:38,485
You rode the coach to check the loot,
to find the best places of holding it up.

326
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:39,747
Maybe.

327
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,126
Maybe I like to see the country.

328
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,293
I ordered you to stay away
from those shipments.

329
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,297
Since when you order me?

330
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:48,957
I told you.

331
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,730
If you or any of your breed
step foot into this town again...

332
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:54,829
I'll have you torn apart.
The pieces thrown to the dogs.

333
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:56,867
He talks.

334
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,371
I don't talk.

335
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:01,703
Shorty, shut up!

336
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:27,668
- Josie, what are you doing here?
- Stop play-acting, Jeff.

337
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:31,398
- You knew darn well I'd follow you.
- No. I never took you for granted.

338
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:35,708
- I told you not to follow me.
- Sorry, Lieutenant, I disobeyed orders.

339
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:39,544
But wouldn't I be foolish, now,
to do everything men told me to do?

340
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:44,782
- You're a long way from home.
- I was, a minute ago.

341
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:49,287
- Why did you come here?
- You see, I was on my way to California...

342
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,828
and I figured you'd never
seen the Pacific Ocean, so...

343
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,363
No go, Josie.

344
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,064
Don't forget you're a wanted man.

345
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:59,932
And California's a lot farther from Louisiana
than Arizona territory.

346
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,528
A wanted man can't be choosy.

347
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:04,404
He stops where they let him
and travels fast when they don't.

348
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,706
- That doesn't sound like you.
- No?

349
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:10,270
Once you learn to toss your conscience
out of the window nothing matters.

350
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:11,713
You don't believe that.

351
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:14,616
- Why shouldn't I?
- Let's not argue.

352
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:17,018
Let's go downstairs
and have a drink to our reunion.

353
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,180
Sure.

354
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,986
By the way, you haven't even told me
you're glad to see me!

355
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:25,189
- I'm glad to see you.
- You play women like you play cards!

356
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,097
I'll toss in.

357
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,810
Look it!

358
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:40,560
Won't be long now. Stone said 11:00.

359
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,164
It's nearly that now.

360
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:45,863
All right, Mueller!

361
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:48,732
Yeah, this'll be like shooting fish in a barrel.

362
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:50,865
Make sure
you don't drop a sack full of grain.

363
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:53,604
It's gold we're after,
and Stone said it's in those sacks.

364
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:55,805
I know. I ain't feeble-minded.

365
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:17,058
There they come.

366
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:56,731
Come on.

367
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,453
Give me that!

368
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:29,827
That man's crazy.

369
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,665
We better get out of here.
He'll shoot us all up.

370
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:43,912
You sure handled them!

371
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,474
Let's go.

372
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:55,181
Giddyup!

373
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,666
- Sorry I'm late.
- You have some explaining to do.

374
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:09,399
Degas and his gang were in action today.
I had to run out.

375
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,236
Why didn't you stop when you saw my men?

376
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:13,243
I thought they were part of the Degas bunch.

377
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:16,303
Take a good look when you pull that trigger.
You shot my hat off.

378
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,439
Had I known it was you,
I could've done better.

379
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:19,949
You're not doing the job I want.

380
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,279
- I wouldn't say that.
- I would.

381
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:24,150
First whack we get
at a worthwhile shipment, you crumb it up.

382
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:26,087
I'll do the talking, Slager. He's right.

383
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:27,317
From your leads so far...

384
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:30,224
what we've taken
off the stages won't keep our horses in oats.

385
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,556
No? This might interest you.

386
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,826
The stage leaving Phoenix
is carrying over $25,000...

387
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,127
in new money.

388
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,895
It'll be in the water cask in the boot.

389
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,870
If these two will do as I say,
they'll get it without trouble.

390
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,599
- Conroy tell you this?
- His daughter.

391
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:46,165
It had better work this time.
I have a lot of patience.

392
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:49,111
But I can't say the same
for Mr. Kurth and Mr. Slager.

393
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,772
They need money.

394
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:52,713
So do I.

395
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:01,950
King wins.

396
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,052
Jack loses.

397
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:08,225
King wins.

398
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:12,059
Ten loses.

399
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:17,835
Try that one.

400
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:20,338
Queen wins.

401
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,070
Three loses.

402
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,807
Never argue with a lady.

403
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,416
Let's keep it that way.

404
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:31,682
Six wins.

405
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:35,386
Queen loses.

406
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,218
- What are you going to do for dinner?
- Why<i>...</i>

407
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,422
Previous engagement, Josie.

408
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,729
- Would it be at the Conroys'?
- I don't mean to neglect you...

409
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:46,827
but my job
has been taking up most of my time.

410
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:51,739
- Eight wins. Five loses.
- Yeah. I hear you have a very mean boss.

411
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:54,334
Maybe we'd find
more privacy somewhere else.

412
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,175
Like California?

413
00:36:56,447 --> 00:37:01,043
- Where'd you get that idea?
- The other day when I saw your mean boss.

414
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,446
Four wins.

415
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:08,258
- You brought me luck!
- I keep telling you we're a great team.

416
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:15,649
Come on, get down from that box
and we'd better not find any rocks today.

417
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:24,698
Come on over here.

418
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,004
- Where is it?
- Come on. Where'd you hide it?

419
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:31,871
I never know. Please don't. I don't know.

420
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,878
Nine wins. Three loses.

421
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,815
Mr. Stone, the boss wants to see you.

422
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,013
- Which boss?
- The one who pays him.

423
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:48,115
- Sorry, Josie. Business.
- Your business comes before my business.

424
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:51,657
Keep on playing them, Josie.

425
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,055
Seven wins. Jack loses.

426
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,000
Hello, Shelby.

427
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:01,498
Hello, Mark.

428
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:04,564
You know, you make that gown
look mighty pretty.

429
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,677
Why, thank you. It's brand-new.

430
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,541
You know, Frank, there's a rule of nature:

431
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,705
There can only be one filly in the pasture.

432
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:13,375
Now, Mark Stone. He's a nice fellow.

433
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:16,750
Remember Shelby Conroy,
how business-like she used to be?

434
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:17,845
No time for frills?

435
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:20,720
Yeah. She's even neglecting
her bookkeeping chores.

436
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,554
I tell you, it's a marvel...

437
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:24,651
the way Mark
has put color back in her cheeks.

438
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,422
Six wins.

439
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:29,594
Ten loses.

440
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,305
Jake's late
bringing that stage in from Phoenix.

441
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,708
There's nothing to worry about.

442
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:43,770
If you're thinking of the money shipment,
Dad's changed the plan.

443
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:46,646
Jake's not bringing the money
with him this trip. Of course...

444
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:47,775
Mark!

445
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:51,519
I've got bad news for you.
I lost all your money.

446
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,517
That's all right.

447
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,784
- Miss Conroy, Miss Sullivan.
- How do you do, Miss Sullivan?

448
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:01,924
Not the Shelby Conroy
who runs the stage line?

449
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,764
I don't run it. I only work in it.

450
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,928
The way you kept telling me
how business-like and efficient she is...

451
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:12,202
I expected to see some frazzled old lady.

452
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:13,834
And you're really quite pretty.

453
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:16,408
Why, thank you. But so are you.

454
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:19,546
Mark is known for his good taste.

455
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:22,316
We've been close friends for years.

456
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:26,852
- Why, Mark, you never told me.
- Why, you never asked me.

457
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,325
Jake should be in that driver's seat.

458
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:58,021
Uncle Jake!

459
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,498
- He's gone.
- They tore up the coach looking for gold.

460
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:12,900
They couldn't find any.
They started on Jake...

461
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,564
- to make him tell where it was.
- They tortured him.

462
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:18,273
They tortured him to make him talk.
But he wouldn't.

463
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:21,072
I was born in this country
and I've seen men fight and kill.

464
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,706
But I've never seen anything as terrible
as what they did to that poor man.

465
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:28,081
He couldn't have told them
there wasn't any gold. He didn't know.

466
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,414
He always said:

467
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,115
<i>"</i>What I don't know,
nobody can ever squeeze out of me<i>."</i>

468
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:35,022
Even if he'd known about a shipment,
Jake wouldn't have talked.

469
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:36,889
No amount of gold could be worth that.

470
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:40,397
It was more than a job.
It was a trust. He put his heart into it.

471
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,392
And lost his life.

472
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:46,637
Now, what's all this?

473
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:47,729
Now, what's all this?

474
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,197
Dad and I don't know what to do.
We're so discouraged.

475
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:53,243
That's new kind of talk for you, Shelby.

476
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:56,541
We won't send more stages
if it means death to those who ride them.

477
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:58,548
I never thought they'd go that far.

478
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:01,278
When the stages quit,
decent people will leave with us.

479
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,116
This town will be dead.
Let the outlaws have it.

480
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,520
And I thought you were a fighter.

481
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:10,582
You yourself said, if you try to save
a burning house, you go up with it.

482
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:13,289
That's something I once heard a fellow say.

483
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:17,625
Jeff, I know you've done everything
you could to help us...

484
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,896
but it's just too much for us.

485
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:24,266
Dad and I are quitting.
And you've got to quit with us.

486
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:27,469
- lf they do to you what they did to Jake, I'd...
- Listen to me.

487
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,479
Maybe there's a chance, but I need time.

488
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,914
I want you to send out a stage
tomorrow as usual, but no gold on it.

489
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,213
- No, I won't...
- Shelby, I'm counting on you.

490
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,623
Soon, real soon I'll give you your chance.

491
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,390
You lied about the gold dust
being on the coach.

492
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:50,660
There was no gold on it.
They killed for nothing.

493
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,258
I told you he double-crossed us!

494
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,600
Conroy held up the shipment
at the last minute.

495
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:57,436
- You say.
- The Conroys are making one big shipment.

496
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:59,271
$100,000 in gold.

497
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:02,205
It'll be going through
Raccoon Pass tomorrow.

498
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:05,976
- lf there's a slip-up...
- There won't be. I'll be driving that stage.

499
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,482
Good evening.

500
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:29,638
- Come on!
- Put me down!

501
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:13,678
- For you, not bad, pig face.
- Pay me.

502
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:23,116
No. Please, don't!

503
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:24,485
Shut up.

504
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:26,820
Nobody ask you.

505
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:34,436
My good old friend, Kansas,
the one you beat his brains out...

506
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:36,834
don't got anymore.

507
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,938
He die dead.

508
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,441
- Don't do it.
- Give me a chance.

509
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:48,879
Hold still! You want me to lose my bet?

510
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:53,982
An eye for an eye. And a tooth for a tooth.

511
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:56,083
Don't!

512
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,492
Never mind the cup. First the gold.

513
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,697
Tie them up!

514
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:24,014
Steady!

515
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:28,150
How could I shoot?

516
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:35,723
Steady! Stop blinking the eyes.

517
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:40,464
- Better give me the gold poke, Degas.
- You!

518
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:45,002
Look at him,
try to roust me with my own gun.

519
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,044
Not at all. I came to return it.

520
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:56,251
Now, we have another little cup for you...

521
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:59,451
and play a little trick on you, stranger.

522
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,554
It'll cost you $100,000 to shoot me.

523
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:10,600
- What kind of a dirty trick is this?
- Mourret's getting stingy with my cut.

524
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:12,931
That's why I'd hate to see him
grab the $100,000...

525
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:15,130
I'll be taking over Raccoon Pass tomorrow.

526
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:18,805
- What time?
- About noon.

527
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:25,140
I'm so sorry,
my good friend, you break the bottle.

528
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,081
I like to invite you to drink.

529
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:32,917
Of course, I'll want a third of the split.
And there's Mourret to get rid of.

530
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:38,660
I wonder if you could take him.
After all, he did drive you out of Prescott.

531
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:42,459
You think we're afraid
about <i>Monsieur</i> Mourret?

532
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,466
I don't know.
He's got you living out here like animals.

533
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,967
They wouldn't be expecting anyone
to jump them from behind.

534
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:53,473
What a dirty mind you have.

535
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:58,276
Get rid of Mourret's gang. Who knows,
you and I might do lot of business together.

536
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:03,685
I give you the best suite
at the Juniper House when I take it over.

537
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:05,616
I'll count on that.

538
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,124
All right, Shorty.

539
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,694
Double eagle...

540
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,531
I can shoot the knot from under the chin.

541
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,192
Don't shoot!

542
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:23,463
Pay me!

543
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,493
I'd like to have a ticket
on the stage to Ash Fork.

544
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:56,401
That's the one
that goes through Raccoon Pass?

545
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:58,600
Yes. That's a wonderful trip.

546
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:01,701
There'll be snow on the ground,
the waterfalls will be frozen.

547
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:03,268
Yeah, how much?

548
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:05,409
$12.

549
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:14,454
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

550
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,690
I was just wondering
how good a driver you were.

551
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:19,659
Have a pleasant journey.

552
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:27,535
Ike, I'd better take this run alone tonight.

553
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:30,334
Nobody'd expect gold
on a stage that didn't carry a guard.

554
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,999
Tell Mr. Conroy.

555
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:45,117
You don't mind if I ride up top, do you?
Just to keep you company.

556
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,757
I wonder what made him change his mind.

557
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:36,331
Just drive for Raccoon Pass.

558
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:19,347
What are you stopping for?

559
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:22,078
There's a tough climb ahead.
Got to let the horses blow.

560
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:24,120
You know Slager's waiting for us up there.

561
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,338
Get the gold first.

562
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:31,848
Scatter.

563
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:27,395
Drop your gun. Drop it!

564
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:31,934
Jules, old friend.

565
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:36,138
- What are you doing here?
- Call off your men. Quick!

566
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,177
Sure.

567
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:43,044
Boys. Let's go home.

568
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,043
It's all over.

569
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:47,684
We made a mistake.

570
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:50,490
Move out! Come on, let's go.

571
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,661
See, Jules? All a mistake.

572
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:01,998
All right?

573
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,569
- I go with my men?
- Just a minute.

574
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:07,040
I'd like some explanation of this mistake.

575
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:08,971
Kurth!

576
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:10,808
Slager!

577
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:12,912
Where are you?

578
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:15,916
Down here, Jules. What's left of us.

579
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:25,192
Where's the rest?
This place looks like a slaughterhouse.

580
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,629
- We're all that's left.
- They jumped us from ambush.

581
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,589
It was a mistake!

582
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,695
We come, see men hiding in the rocks.

583
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,531
Figure Sheriff was looking for us.

584
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:39,969
- Figure send them home quick.
- Where's the stage?

585
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:44,272
Stone pulled out when the shooting started.
I fell off on the turn.

586
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:46,141
Excuse me, Jules.

587
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,914
I'll pay you off some day.

588
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:50,578
Now I go?

589
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:53,316
So it was just a coincidence
you were here at this pass...

590
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:56,416
when the stage was passing through
and my men weren't watching.

591
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:59,656
Of course! Just a confidence.

592
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:02,857
I don't believe in coincidence.
Who told you to jump us here?

593
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:07,695
- lf I had a gun<i>...</i>
- I have the gun now.

594
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:10,704
- Who told you?
- Nobody.

595
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:14,040
Was it Stone?

596
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:16,977
Your guns are useless now, Degas.
Was it Mark Stone?

597
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:20,141
Mark Stone. That's it.
I think he pushed me off on the turn.

598
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,740
Help me, please.

599
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:32,358
- Was it Mark Stone who set up this ambush?
- I'm shot. I need help.

600
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:35,421
You need help. First, tell me if it was Mark!

601
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:40,403
Mark Stone, Shorty?

602
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:42,393
Yeah.

603
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:18,297
What are you doing back here?

604
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:21,105
Hide the coach and the horses.
Put this in a safe place.

605
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:25,079
And if anyone comes looking for me,
all you know is I'm on my way to Phoenix.

606
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,534
You were a fool to even try.

607
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:55,237
That depends.
I don't know yet how many got out alive.

608
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:58,041
Jules is smart.
He's bound to figure you sold him out.

609
00:56:58,114 --> 00:56:59,604
Now you have to leave town.

610
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:03,174
Are we on our way to California again?
You'll have to go alone.

611
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,585
And leave you here
to get your head blown off?

612
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:08,818
Come on, pack.
Go someplace else, then. Anyplace, but go.

613
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:10,792
You don't even have to tell me where.

614
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:14,853
- There is no one like you in this world.
- I know. I'm a great friend.

615
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,593
I made a deal with Mourret,
but it didn't include murder.

616
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:19,567
Now things have happened.
Like Jake Hooper.

617
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:21,103
And Shelby Conroy?

618
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:24,470
In trying to square one debt,
I got into another that has to be paid.

619
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:27,772
Fine people have been hurt.
People I thought didn't matter.

620
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:33,448
There goes my dream.
All right, stay here as long as you like.

621
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:36,212
But before they put your name
on a slab on Boot Hill...

622
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,618
you might as well know I lied to you.

623
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:41,586
You're not a wanted man.
There was a witness.

624
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:45,287
A little stevedore who played the harmonica
saw the whole thing.

625
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:47,659
From what he told,
it was anything but murder.

626
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:50,130
If I'd known this yesterday,
Jake'd still be alive.

627
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,294
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because I knew I'd have a hold on you...

628
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:56,600
and you'd have to keep running
and I'd have to be running after you.

629
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:59,634
Don't blame me for using tricks to hold you.

630
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:03,770
That Conroy girl would use plenty
if you meant enough to her.

631
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:07,445
I don't even know if you're in love with her.

632
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:09,908
It doesn't matter.

633
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:14,420
Now you can go to her with
a grand confession. I hope she understands.

634
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:18,158
- I also hope she kicks you out on your ear!
- Maybe she will.

635
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:23,196
- Where are you going?
- I need a drink. Maybe five or six.

636
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:01,303
I'm glad you boys made it.
What are the guns all about?

637
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,635
You're not mad
because I had to turn around again?

638
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,537
There wasn't much else I could do.

639
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:08,209
Mourret all right, too?

640
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:11,538
Find out who those men were?

641
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:14,142
We also found out other things.

642
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,109
Yeah.

643
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:20,083
Your friend Degas wouldn't talk,
but Dutch had a loose mouth.

644
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:23,583
Now stick out your wrists.

645
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:39,872
Now sit down.

646
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:45,674
Why go to all this bother?

647
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:48,243
I'll fetch Jules.

648
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:59,524
Breathe deep, mister, while you can.

649
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,327
Jules didn't want us to plug you.

650
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:07,032
When he gets here, he'll skin the hide
off your bones an inch at a time.

651
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,875
Too bad you're a dirty rat.

652
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:20,714
No, I'd never be able to trust you.

653
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,925
- What do you mean, you can't trust me?
- Forget it.

654
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:33,451
Scum like you'd probably cut my throat
and keep it all.

655
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:35,963
Hit me again
and you'll probably jar my memory.

656
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:38,227
Make me forget where I hid the strongbox.

657
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:40,701
You mean you didn't bring it
back to the station?

658
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:44,672
You think I'd turn $100,000 back to Conroy?
What do you take me for?

659
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:48,910
I was packing to go when you boys came in.
Too bad.

660
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:51,643
Where is it?

661
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:55,647
You better tell me.

662
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:59,813
If I thought I could trust you,
we might talk a deal.

663
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:02,748
Just you and me. Not Mourret, nobody else.

664
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:05,558
You're just talking to save your neck.

665
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:08,495
I'm wasting my breath
on a big, stupid ox like you.

666
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:12,159
You wouldn't even know
what to do with $50,000 all your own.

667
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:14,960
$50,000?

668
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:17,766
Yeah. I was figuring
on going to New Orleans.

669
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,473
A man could live like a king
with all that money.

670
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:24,975
Everything he wants. Beautiful Creole girls.

671
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:27,709
You ought to see them.

672
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:32,183
No women so pretty anyplace in the world.

673
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:35,950
Skin like amber velvet,
soft and smooth to the touch.

674
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:39,393
They can drive a man out of his mind.

675
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:44,029
They like a big man, a man with muscle.
But it takes more than that.

676
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,191
You've got to have money to spend.

677
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:49,670
Clothes and a big diamond stickpin
wouldn't hurt.

678
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:53,938
Until you've lived like that,
you don't know what living is.

679
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:59,147
But it takes a better man than you, Slager,
to make up his mind what he wants.

680
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:04,883
All right.

681
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,379
Fifty-fifty.

682
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:12,190
But I'm keeping this gun on you
till I see the color of that gold.

683
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,417
I'm back here.

684
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:18,377
Holster your gun.

685
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:25,756
You've been pushing
to use that gun on me, Kurth.

686
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:29,355
- I promised you the chance.
- What are you waiting for, Stone?

687
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,767
Afraid to face me. So you're fixing
to gun me down in the back?

688
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:34,496
You don't deserve any better.

689
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:36,594
Raise your hands.

690
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:43,206
Higher. Over your head.

691
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,219
Turn around.

692
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:02,562
You like it better this way, Kurth?

693
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:06,965
Yeah.

694
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,761
Poley, Mark Stone been in here tonight?

695
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:45,204
Not tonight.
What's he done to you, Mr. Mourret?

696
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,832
What makes you think that?

697
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:49,434
I don't know. You got
a funny look on your face.

698
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:52,446
Last time I saw it was just before
you hung Gigs Barlow.

699
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:54,210
- Some day, Poley, I'll...
- Jules!

700
01:05:58,521 --> 01:06:01,490
Kurth is laying over in the alley, dead.
Stone killed him.

701
01:06:01,557 --> 01:06:04,048
He just stood there, cold as ice,
and shot him down.

702
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,519
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.

703
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:15,129
- You waiting for him, too?
- Go away.

704
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:16,671
That's no way to talk.

705
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:19,003
We've been friends for a long time.

706
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:21,475
It was mostly as a favor to you
that I helped Jeff.

707
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:26,004
- Helped Jeff? Used him, you mean.
- I'm a business man collecting a debt.

708
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:31,149
By this time, that Conroy girl
knows all about you and that debt.

709
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:34,618
- I'm not worried about the Conroys.
- I wish Jeff wasn't.

710
01:06:35,091 --> 01:06:38,060
She's probably twisting him
around her little finger right now.

711
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:40,687
- So that's where he is.
- I didn't say that.

712
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:43,020
But you did, my dear.

713
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:47,334
You got a few of notches in your gun.
You ever shoot a man in the back?

714
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:49,963
You know better!
They saw it coming. They had a chance.

715
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,837
That's the way we do things.
We give and take our chances.

716
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:55,340
Reef, you trigger that gun of yours
now and again.

717
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:57,777
Did you ever kill a man
that never did anything to you?

718
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:01,044
Only in war. Otherwise live and let live.
That's the way I feel.

719
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:03,813
Soldier, you know what
the Quantrill Raiders were?

720
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:05,011
Sure.

721
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:08,250
Butchers that used the war
to cover up their murders and robberies.

722
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:11,521
There's one of them in town now.
He doesn't do things the way we do.

723
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:13,687
When he shoots a man,
he shoots him in the back.

724
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:15,856
And that's the way
he killed Dan Kurth tonight.

725
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:16,955
He can't get away.

726
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,898
Things like that give this town a bad name.

727
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:21,368
Yes, and we ought to do something about it
right now.

728
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:23,837
Let's take something along with us,
like a rope.

729
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:26,567
Sure, let's get a rope.

730
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:29,042
Yeah, come on. Let's get a rope.

731
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:31,238
Wait! He's lying!

732
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:35,049
Mourret is lying!

733
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:38,280
What else can she say?
She's in love with him.

734
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:42,051
- Come on, boys. Let's go.
- Can't anybody stop them?

735
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:46,121
Where there's a stampede, ma'am,
the safest place is up a tall tree.

736
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:55,964
Quiet!

737
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:59,070
Shoot him the minute he comes out.

738
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:25,124
- Quick! It's a lynching!
- So that's what all the ruckus is about!

739
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:27,692
Is that all? You've got to stop them!

740
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:30,170
I can't try nothing like that
without the Sheriff.

741
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:31,365
I don't know where he went.

742
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,000
What are you going in there for?
There's nobody there.

743
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:37,305
- Wait! Where you going with that gun?
- Stay back.

744
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:41,072
I can't understand it.

745
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,912
Men like Degas and Mueller,
yes, but Mourret?

746
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:47,444
He's still alive. Out in the open now.
And the killing's already started.

747
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:50,754
I knew it had to be someone here.
I would believe it was Mourret.

748
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:53,920
- lf I could only believe you.
- I've told you all about myself.

749
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:56,988
Where I've lied, what I've done,
and why I did it.

750
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:59,330
There's nothing to gain by lying now.

751
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:03,067
Of course he's telling us the truth.

752
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:06,506
What can we gain against
anyone as powerful as Mourret?

753
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,896
The house is surrounded, Travis.

754
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:33,426
You can't get away.
You've got just 30 seconds.

755
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:36,631
Send him out, Conroy.

756
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:43,768
All right, Travis, we're coming in.

757
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:52,520
Did you find him?

758
01:13:52,961 --> 01:13:54,394
You clumsy idiot.

759
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:57,095
You all seem a little jumpy this morning.

760
01:13:57,566 --> 01:13:59,966
Have a drink. On the house, of course.

761
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:01,866
Yeah, I do need an eye-opener, at that.

762
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:04,064
You've been needing
an eye-opener all your life.

763
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:07,302
Lay off, Jules.
It wasn't my fault he got away. Not this time.

764
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:10,840
You know, I remember
when he first came here.

765
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:13,611
Right through that door.

766
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:15,611
Now we've lost him for good.

767
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:18,949
You really think you've seen the last
of Jeff Travis?

768
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:21,655
He won't dare show his face
around here again.

769
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:29,057
What are you getting at?

770
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:31,490
You think he'll come back?

771
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:35,094
Don't you? He's not the running-away kind.
He'll come back.

772
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:37,764
My men have blocked
every street and alley into this town.

773
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,603
They're good boys. They'll stop him.

774
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:42,041
Sure, they'll get him.
A fly couldn't get through.

775
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:44,578
That tall man is a lot smarter than any fly.

776
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:48,377
You don't think those fellows are
going to stand and wait for Jeff to show up?

777
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:50,350
They'd better. They have my orders.

778
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:54,411
Your orders? You got the crowd last night...

779
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,651
when it was liquored up
and ready for excitement.

780
01:14:56,725 --> 01:14:59,125
They're tired out now,
they've been up all night.

781
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:01,560
Probably home right now, sleeping it off.

782
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:05,158
Take a look. See if they're still there.

783
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:07,327
- Why, sure they are, Jules.
- I said look!

784
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:25,380
They're gone, Jules.
The dirty, yellow dogs ran out on us.

785
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:26,512
They couldn't.

786
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:28,385
You beginning to feel it, too?

787
01:15:29,057 --> 01:15:32,117
- Shut up, Poley.
- Don't be so jumpy, Jules.

788
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:35,595
Poley is only trying to tell you
he sort of feels Jeff's presence.

789
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:40,127
- Now what?
- I thought I heard something.

790
01:15:42,838 --> 01:15:44,829
Feel how still the air is.

791
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:48,068
Like just before a cyclone or a storm.

792
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,303
Or death.

793
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:55,009
- Stop talking like that, or so help me I'll...
- Get a hold of yourself.

794
01:15:58,186 --> 01:15:59,312
Sure.

795
01:16:01,456 --> 01:16:03,014
We got nothing to worry about.

796
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:05,121
We can handle it.

797
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:08,986
We always handle everything together.
Both of us, huh, Jules?

798
01:16:12,968 --> 01:16:14,435
Good morning, Josie.

799
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:17,235
Morning, Jeff.

800
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:25,910
It's later than I thought,
and I've got things to do. Elsewhere.

801
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,718
Sorry I kept you fellows up all night.

802
01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:33,220
I'm sorry about all this, Jeff.

803
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:35,247
We were too hotheaded.

804
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:39,857
- The two of us can still get together.
- Which one of your men killed Jake Hooper?

805
01:16:44,466 --> 01:16:46,297
What are you looking at me for?

806
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:50,565
- I thought he was the one.
- Wait a minute.

807
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:52,470
That'll satisfy the Hooper killing.

808
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:55,600
You can easily prove
that you killed Dan Kurth in a fair fight.

809
01:16:55,677 --> 01:16:58,111
That'll satisfy folks all around.
We'd both be clean.

810
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:00,273
- Jules, you wouldn't!
- How about it, Jeff?

811
01:17:00,349 --> 01:17:02,180
We can play out the string together.

812
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:03,774
We could, Jules.

813
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:07,450
But I'll give you a choice instead.

814
01:17:07,656 --> 01:17:09,453
Get out of here, Josie.

815
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:23,328
You let me take you in
so the law can hang you...

816
01:17:23,505 --> 01:17:26,201
or go for your gun.
We'll finish it up right here.

817
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:28,242
You're being kind of hard on me, Jeff.

818
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:31,040
I'm giving you a better chance
than you ever gave anyone.

819
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:38,044
Jeff, look out!

820
01:18:10,052 --> 01:18:11,519
Fine fire, Jeff.

821
01:18:12,387 --> 01:18:14,685
Reminds you of Lawrence, remember?

822
01:18:15,657 --> 01:18:18,888
You going to stay there and burn,
or come out and take a bullet?

823
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:02,660
There's only the two of us left, Jeff.

824
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:10,206
Let's call it off, Jeff! What do you say?

825
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:17,277
We'll burn if we stay here.

826
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,746
We'll both get out that door.

827
01:19:23,725 --> 01:19:25,852
Only one of us is going out.

828
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:39,861
Jeff, how does it feel
to be free of everything...

829
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:42,028
have all accounts square and settled?

830
01:20:42,103 --> 01:20:45,937
Guns never settle anything the right way.
I'm through with them, Josie.

831
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:48,805
But you're gonna need one in California.

832
01:20:48,877 --> 01:20:51,402
Sorry, but I'm not going to California.

833
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:53,775
I know that's what you said.

834
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:02,054
I wish you'd reconsider.
You could stay here with us.

835
01:21:02,123 --> 01:21:05,183
- Run the stage if you like.
- Thanks, but it wouldn't work.

836
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:07,728
I'm used to something
that's more of a gamble.

837
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:10,195
Would you, please?

838
01:21:10,265 --> 01:21:13,029
Goodbye, Mr. Conroy. Shelby.

839
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:16,261
Good luck always, Jeff.

840
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:18,166
Thanks.

841
01:21:22,577 --> 01:21:24,704
Jeff, would you open the door, please?

842
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:27,509
I scorched my hands a little in that fire.

843
01:21:27,582 --> 01:21:30,176
Do you want to fix them here
or in California?

844
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:32,383
Why, honeychild.

845
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:35,821
We'll fix them on the way,
they'll heal in California.
