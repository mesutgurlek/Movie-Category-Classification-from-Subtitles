1
00:00:40,253 --> 00:00:42,653
- This is sure going to be good.
- Junior knows how to do things.

2
00:03:18,845 --> 00:03:25,751
You left to find a pot of gold

3
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:32,452
A thousand miles you rode alone
All alone

4
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:38,930
The long and lonely way
will not lead you anywhere

5
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:46,461
You'll come back home, someday
You'll come back home, someday

6
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:54,410
The wind will steal your pot of gold

7
00:03:55,615 --> 00:04:00,882
And fill your eyes with burning sand,
bitter sand

8
00:04:00,987 --> 00:04:07,222
No star will show the way
And no one will hear your prayer

9
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:15,166
You'll come back home, someday
You'll come back home, someday

10
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:25,277
You went away forever
You went away alone.

11
00:04:25,946 --> 00:04:39,587
But someone's always waitin'
for you at home, today

12
00:04:54,941 --> 00:05:01,369
No star will show the way
And no one will hear your prayer

13
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:09,115
You'll come back home, someday
You'll come back home, someday

14
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:18,996
You went away forever
You went away alone.

15
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:34,145
But someone's always waitin'
for you at home, today

16
00:05:56,836 --> 00:05:58,929
Murry! Look at this!

17
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,529
Good boy!

18
00:06:24,764 --> 00:06:26,857
That 's enough for today.
Come and it!

19
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:37,406
Here you are, Jake.

20
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:41,075
Here's yours.

21
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:43,815
Here you go.

22
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:47,981
That's for you.

23
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,754
Here we go.

24
00:07:32,732 --> 00:07:34,131
Vincent!

25
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:36,766
Did you come from home?
How's my brother Jeff?

26
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,065
Has something happend to old Mercedes?

27
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,930
Why did you come here?

28
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:44,469
Who sent you?

29
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:57,112
>From Carradine. He says I have to
come here quick. That's all he says.

30
00:07:58,024 --> 00:08:00,515
Why does Carradine want me
to come back there?

31
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:02,886
Why don't you answer?!

32
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:04,819
Tell me what's happened!

33
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:07,022
I don't know, Tom,
I don't know.

34
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:09,494
Then you and I can 
go back to town!

35
00:08:09,602 --> 00:08:11,331
I'm never going back to that town!

36
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:42,917
Come in!

37
00:09:44,697 --> 00:09:45,686
Hello, Murray.

38
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,567
What's this all about, son?

39
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:51,330
Why do you want to leave?
Is something wrong?

40
00:09:51,704 --> 00:09:54,366
An ol d friend of the family has
sent me a note.

41
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,104
He says I have to come home.

42
00:09:57,744 --> 00:09:58,802
Home?

43
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:00,437
Who do you have at home?

44
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:02,405
My brother Jeff

45
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:05,242
and our old Indian nurse Mercedes.

46
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:10,018
Jeff has some land and a nice house.

47
00:10:11,557 --> 00:10:14,253
When my mother died,
she had been a widow for years,

48
00:10:14,694 --> 00:10:16,457
she left everything to him

49
00:10:17,063 --> 00:10:19,327
and made me swear that I'd go away.

50
00:10:19,832 --> 00:10:22,130
Why? Not enough land for two?

51
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:23,930
Oh, yes, there was enough,

52
00:10:24,037 --> 00:10:26,972
but I had money. They sent it to me
wherever I was.

53
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:28,802
Didn't you ever go back home?

54
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:31,876
Once for a few days, years ago.

55
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:42,885
I'll be back soon!

56
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:44,149
Goodbye!

57
00:10:44,757 --> 00:10:45,485
Take care.
Bye, Tom.

58
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:46,387
Take care of yourself, son!

59
00:12:57,757 --> 00:13:01,022
Excuse me, isn't this the farm
of widow Corbett's son?

60
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:02,719
No, mister, it's Scott's land.

61
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:05,360
I'm talking about Jeff Corbett.

62
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:09,299
And who's that? This here land
belongs to mister Scott now.

63
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,300
Do you know where I can find
Jeff Corbett, please?

64
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:16,474
I don't know who this man is you're
talking about.

65
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:17,372
Get going!

66
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,442
Ask them.

67
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:23,442
Thank you.

68
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:27,608
Can you tell me

69
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:30,385
where I can find the widow Corbett's son?

70
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,323
I'm sorry,
we're not from these parts.

71
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:38,956
Hey! Anybody know the son of
widow Corbett?

72
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:43,359
Yes, I know! He works as a blacksmith
with the old Chinese fellow,

73
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:45,994
at the corner near the saloon,
behind the Scott bank.

74
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:47,536
Thank you.

75
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,107
Where are you going?

76
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,907
Back to town?

77
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:04,718
You're a stranger,
but you better learn some things quick.

78
00:14:04,924 --> 00:14:08,792
When you see that sign,

79
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,487
don't pass through 
unless you're invited.

80
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,293
That sign means you're standing
on mister Scott's property,

81
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,836
and mister Scott doesn't like people
trespassing on land that belongs to him.

82
00:14:18,871 --> 00:14:22,272
So long. 
Don't forget what I said.

83
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:32,217
Where did you steal the horse?

84
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:01,161
Good morning.

85
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:03,101
Good morning.

86
00:16:03,576 --> 00:16:05,567
I'm looking for Jeffrey Corbett.

87
00:16:05,678 --> 00:16:09,205
He should be here. But as you see,

88
00:16:09,315 --> 00:16:10,441
he is not here.

89
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:11,573
Where can I find him?

90
00:16:11,684 --> 00:16:14,915
You follow the smell of tequila.

91
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:16,249
Where does he live?

92
00:16:16,355 --> 00:16:20,382
He has a house. However,
who knows if he lives there!

93
00:16:20,493 --> 00:16:23,360
You go on road to west,
it's outside of town!

94
00:16:25,998 --> 00:16:30,492
Hey, stranger, you mustn't run away
like this without you do your duty.

95
00:16:30,603 --> 00:16:35,404
Information costs 20 cents.
I don't work for nothing.

96
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:38,169
What... if I don't give it to you?

97
00:16:38,277 --> 00:16:40,370
Confucius say:

98
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:44,140
"If you want to live a long life, try

99
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,209
to be ignorant and know nothing."
But in this town,

100
00:16:48,354 --> 00:16:49,821
you have to know a lot of things

101
00:16:50,756 --> 00:16:52,781
to live a long life.

102
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,319
Twenty cents, please.

103
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:30,119
It's Scott.

104
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:29,576
Hold it!

105
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:43,389
We're leaving, mister Scott.
We can't get along on what we earn.

106
00:19:43,496 --> 00:19:46,056
Working for you don't yield us anything.

107
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:49,961
But you can't leave us like this, 
my good friend. What's your name, hmm?

108
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:52,734
Farr, Jeremiah Farr.

109
00:19:52,838 --> 00:19:54,237
Well, Jeremiah, you see,

110
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:57,670
there 's plenty of land around here:

111
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:01,846
Fields to cultivate, virginlands
to be cleared, herds to tend.

112
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:04,273
That's true, mister Scott...

113
00:20:08,754 --> 00:20:13,088
There's plenty of land, there are fields
to cultivate, herds to tend,

114
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:15,422
but not when it's Scott's lands and herds!

115
00:20:15,528 --> 00:20:17,894
My son is right. We're going

116
00:20:17,997 --> 00:20:22,593
It's a pretty place and we're sorry to
leave it, but we can't do otherwise.

117
00:20:22,735 --> 00:20:26,796
But, Jeremiah, how can you leave land
where you lived so long,

118
00:20:26,906 --> 00:20:29,431
land where you've buried your dead?

119
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:31,533
None of my dead are buried here.

120
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,274
One will be now.

121
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,128
A new customer.

122
00:22:49,948 --> 00:22:51,472
Long life to you!

123
00:23:17,976 --> 00:23:21,810
Come in! It's open.

124
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:39,061
Who are you?

125
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:41,623
What do you want?

126
00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:44,198
You want a drink?

127
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:49,702
No one wants nothing.

128
00:23:50,175 --> 00:23:52,871
Don't drink.

129
00:23:56,548 --> 00:23:59,483
Who are you anyhow?

130
00:24:16,835 --> 00:24:18,166
It's Tom!

131
00:24:34,086 --> 00:24:35,280
Hello, Jeff.

132
00:24:49,968 --> 00:24:50,957
Jeff!

133
00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:53,595
Tom!

134
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:05,969
When are you leaving, Tom?

135
00:26:08,914 --> 00:26:11,348
I just got here and now you want me
to leave.

136
00:26:12,017 --> 00:26:13,814
You have to go, Tom.

137
00:26:14,386 --> 00:26:16,081
You can't stay here.

138
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:22,424
It wasn't my idea to come.
Carradine sent me a note.

139
00:26:23,195 --> 00:26:25,095
He said to come and I'm here.

140
00:26:26,064 --> 00:26:27,895
I was worried about you two...

141
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:32,400
Why are you living in this shack?!

142
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:40,373
I heard ma's farm belongs to somebody
named Scott...

143
00:26:46,251 --> 00:26:48,378
You had the right to sell it
to anyone you wanted,

144
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:50,682
but why to a rat like Scott
and a hyena like Junior?

145
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:53,417
You have to leave, Tom,
and quick.

146
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:56,858
You mustn't let yourself be seen
around here.

147
00:26:56,962 --> 00:26:59,123
Did you meet anyone you know?

148
00:27:00,866 --> 00:27:02,299
No, I didn't meet anyone.

149
00:27:05,737 --> 00:27:06,726
Alright,

150
00:27:07,606 --> 00:27:10,973
I'll go outside now
and get your horse ready.

151
00:27:13,578 --> 00:27:16,638
I'm not going any place, not before
I've talked with Carradine!

152
00:27:26,091 --> 00:27:27,422
Don't you fight,

153
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,722
not you two.

154
00:27:33,865 --> 00:27:35,890
I've got to see Carradine.

155
00:29:54,739 --> 00:29:55,569
Well, boys,

156
00:29:56,274 --> 00:29:57,172
having fun?

157
00:31:56,595 --> 00:31:58,825
Hey, bartender! Tequila!

158
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:42,404
Here. Hey, bartender,
give me a drink, will ya?

159
00:32:44,476 --> 00:32:45,340
Hey, you!

160
00:32:48,446 --> 00:32:49,572
Give us a light.

161
00:32:50,081 --> 00:32:52,015
I don 't smoke.

162
00:33:52,377 --> 00:33:53,776
Hey, tequila!

163
00:34:11,096 --> 00:34:13,690
I'm thirsty.

164
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,442
Excuse me.

165
00:34:30,014 --> 00:34:30,673
Two!

166
00:36:40,545 --> 00:36:41,671
Come on, let's go home.

167
00:36:41,779 --> 00:36:43,940
No-oh...

168
00:36:44,816 --> 00:36:45,976
I was having fun.

169
00:36:51,856 --> 00:36:52,845
Listen:

170
00:36:53,691 --> 00:36:54,817
Confucius say:

171
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:58,859
"He who is always strong of heart
can defeat an army."

172
00:36:58,963 --> 00:37:03,457
But as usual he was wrong.
Everyone needs a little help.

173
00:37:10,074 --> 00:37:13,168
One dollar a shot, please...

174
00:37:20,685 --> 00:37:23,620
I'm putting it away for my old age.

175
00:37:23,721 --> 00:37:25,154
One... two... three

176
00:37:25,857 --> 00:37:28,223
That's enough.

177
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:56,042
I have to shake those men off
and get to Carradine.

178
00:37:56,321 --> 00:37:58,016
Yeah, go ahead.

179
00:37:59,857 --> 00:38:02,553
Your horse has rested long enough.

180
00:38:03,227 --> 00:38:05,593
You had a good time with your friends
at the saloon.

181
00:38:06,397 --> 00:38:08,490
I'll say goodbye to Mercedes for you.

182
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:10,726
Let's shake hands and then
you get out of here.

183
00:38:11,636 --> 00:38:13,194
Get out of here!

184
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:15,101
No.

185
00:38:16,407 --> 00:38:18,170
Now, while I'm gone
you stay out of trouble.

186
00:38:30,588 --> 00:38:33,751
Thanks, oh lord, for the food

187
00:38:33,925 --> 00:38:36,519
which we are now about to receive.

188
00:38:37,195 --> 00:38:38,184
Amen.

189
00:38:59,017 --> 00:39:00,644
Tom! I've been expecting you.
Come in.

190
00:39:01,152 --> 00:39:02,176
Did anyone see you?

191
00:39:02,286 --> 00:39:02,775
I don't think so.

192
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:03,876
Wait a minute.

193
00:39:04,188 --> 00:39:05,485
We can't talk here.

194
00:39:08,626 --> 00:39:11,789
Let's go to the hay loft.
We can go around the back way.

195
00:39:13,197 --> 00:39:14,164
Come on, come.

196
00:39:16,134 --> 00:39:17,533
What is it, mother?

197
00:39:45,196 --> 00:39:46,185
Carradine!

198
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:51,361
Scott's men...

199
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:27,995
Your favourite piece, isn't it?

200
00:41:28,633 --> 00:41:31,659
You taught it to me, holding me
on your lap.

201
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:33,127
Remember?

202
00:41:33,237 --> 00:41:34,829
Son, I want to talk to you.

203
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:37,471
You want me to finish the piece.

204
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:41,177
You always used to ask me for it,

205
00:41:42,246 --> 00:41:43,804
until a few years ago.

206
00:41:43,915 --> 00:41:45,644
You're grown up now, Junior.

207
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,024
You love me, daddy?

208
00:41:55,126 --> 00:41:56,957
I want to talk to you.

209
00:41:57,061 --> 00:41:58,426
What is it, daddy?

210
00:42:00,331 --> 00:42:01,992
Aren't we still one?

211
00:42:02,767 --> 00:42:05,565
Remember, you and me,

212
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:08,966
not you, not me,

213
00:42:09,106 --> 00:42:10,573
both of us.

214
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:13,768
You pushed me away from you!

215
00:42:13,878 --> 00:42:15,743
You mustn't do whatever
You feel like, son!

216
00:42:15,847 --> 00:42:18,975
You told me I was the boss,
that I was in charge.

217
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:20,380
There is a limit to everything!

218
00:42:20,785 --> 00:42:23,686
To everything, daddy,
to everything...

219
00:42:30,761 --> 00:42:32,820
Not just to what I do...

220
00:42:38,102 --> 00:42:39,831
Understand?

221
00:42:40,538 --> 00:42:41,732
What are you trying to say?

222
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,774
What you are trying not to say.

223
00:42:47,478 --> 00:42:48,775
Please, daddy,

224
00:42:49,947 --> 00:42:52,882
don't put yourself against me.

225
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:56,986
I love you.

226
00:43:15,406 --> 00:43:17,636
Let's finish the piece together,
shall we?

227
00:43:38,029 --> 00:43:39,894
What's going on around here?

228
00:43:40,998 --> 00:43:42,829
Why did they kill the Carradines?

229
00:43:43,668 --> 00:43:45,727
Why didn't they get rid of us
at the saloon?

230
00:43:47,138 --> 00:43:48,935
And who's Scott?

231
00:43:52,276 --> 00:43:53,971
What have I got to do
with what's happened?

232
00:43:54,578 --> 00:43:55,772
When will it be my turn?

233
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:56,912
When?

234
00:43:57,014 --> 00:44:01,576
You can rest easy,
they won't shoot at you.

235
00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:05,216
That's right.
They don't want to shoot at me.

236
00:44:05,323 --> 00:44:06,517
But why?

237
00:44:10,394 --> 00:44:11,725
Want a drink?

238
00:44:12,964 --> 00:44:14,864
You must give me a hand, Jeff.

239
00:44:16,567 --> 00:44:19,127
If you want a hand,
I'll give you one.

240
00:44:21,505 --> 00:44:24,804
I'll go and get your horse ready,

241
00:44:25,076 --> 00:44:27,567
so that you can leave.

242
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,550
Tomorrow I'm going to see Scott.

243
00:44:34,652 --> 00:44:36,210
At least he'll be able to
tell me something.

244
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,309
Well,

245
00:44:39,023 --> 00:44:41,685
I think I'll go to sleep.

246
00:44:48,332 --> 00:44:50,300
Goodbye, mister Carradine.

247
00:45:00,444 --> 00:45:01,934
Good morning.

248
00:45:05,416 --> 00:45:07,884
Confucius say:

249
00:45:07,985 --> 00:45:13,321
"Burying the dead is a gratuitous and
meritoriuos task." But

250
00:45:13,424 --> 00:45:17,383
Cofucius, of course,
didn't live in this town.

251
00:45:17,495 --> 00:45:22,558
Burial takes up much of my time, and
unfortunately I have to make it profitable.

252
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:25,726
Confucius will surely forgive me

253
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:31,606
if I say that the Carradines' funeral
costs three dollars a coffin.

254
00:45:32,309 --> 00:45:35,210
Which comes to... comes to...

255
00:45:35,713 --> 00:45:39,240
er, twelve.

256
00:45:44,522 --> 00:45:45,511
Thank you.

257
00:45:45,623 --> 00:45:50,788
You know how to live.

258
00:45:51,762 --> 00:45:52,888
Now,

259
00:45:53,431 --> 00:45:55,956
can you tell me where to find Scott?

260
00:45:57,768 --> 00:45:59,292
Have you a million dollars?

261
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:00,766
What?

262
00:46:01,072 --> 00:46:03,302
Confucius he also say:

263
00:46:03,407 --> 00:46:07,810
"There is no amount of money that can
equal the earthly life of a man,

264
00:46:07,912 --> 00:46:11,348
even if he is very lowly."
And I am very lowly,

265
00:46:11,449 --> 00:46:17,911
but for this once I heartily agree
with Confucius.

266
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:34,601
What will you have to drink?

267
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,066
Whisky double.

268
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:43,203
How is Mister Scott?

269
00:46:45,716 --> 00:46:47,946
Fine, I think.

270
00:46:49,887 --> 00:46:51,286
Where can I find him?

271
00:46:51,989 --> 00:46:52,978
Find who?

272
00:46:58,395 --> 00:47:00,590
Doesn't this saloon belong to
Mister Scott?

273
00:47:00,798 --> 00:47:01,457
What saloon?

274
00:47:08,806 --> 00:47:10,034
Can you give me a little scotch,
chubby?

275
00:47:10,141 --> 00:47:11,540
Yeah.

276
00:47:11,642 --> 00:47:13,200
This place is mine, too.

277
00:47:17,414 --> 00:47:19,507
My name is Tom Corbett, Madam.

278
00:47:20,384 --> 00:47:21,874
Can you give me some information?

279
00:47:22,753 --> 00:47:23,845
Depends.

280
00:47:24,722 --> 00:47:26,781
Where does Mister Scott live?

281
00:47:27,258 --> 00:47:29,351
Now that's not a piece of information.

282
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,652
What is it?

283
00:47:30,995 --> 00:47:33,293
Much more and much less.

284
00:47:33,531 --> 00:47:37,797
You see, Mister Corbett, in this town
everyone knows where Mister Scott lives.

285
00:47:38,002 --> 00:47:39,731
What do I do then?

286
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:41,761
What do you do then? Well,

287
00:47:42,206 --> 00:47:46,142
if no one has told you, I'm not
going to be the one to do it.

288
00:48:22,947 --> 00:48:25,415
Nobody wants to tell me
where to find Scott.

289
00:48:25,516 --> 00:48:28,007
But if I have to ride all over New Mexico,
I'll find him.

290
00:48:28,452 --> 00:48:30,613
Yeah, sooner or later.

291
00:48:31,655 --> 00:48:33,316
Why don't you come with me?

292
00:48:33,591 --> 00:48:36,185
We'd never get to him.

293
00:48:36,894 --> 00:48:37,622
Why not?

294
00:48:38,062 --> 00:48:40,257
Too many guards.

295
00:48:40,364 --> 00:48:42,161
They shoot on sight.

296
00:48:48,806 --> 00:48:50,273
I'll go with you.

297
00:48:51,242 --> 00:48:54,609
With you, I'm safe.

298
00:48:56,413 --> 00:48:57,937
Alright. Shall we go?

299
00:48:58,082 --> 00:48:59,071
Why not?

300
00:49:48,165 --> 00:49:49,962
I've got to see Mister Scott.

301
00:49:50,067 --> 00:49:52,763
Sorry,
I haven't been told about that.

302
00:49:54,138 --> 00:49:55,435
I've got to see him.

303
00:49:55,806 --> 00:49:59,003
If you really had to see Mister Scott,
he would have told us about it.

304
00:50:02,946 --> 00:50:04,573
I can't let you go on.

305
00:50:15,826 --> 00:50:17,885
Do you really want to see Scott?

306
00:50:18,662 --> 00:50:20,152
Why, of course I do.

307
00:50:20,264 --> 00:50:22,562
But the way things are going, I reckon
I'll never get to see him.

308
00:50:22,666 --> 00:50:26,625
Will you take the responsibility
for the death of those six men?

309
00:50:28,806 --> 00:50:31,502
Take the responsibility?
Before who?

310
00:50:31,608 --> 00:50:33,439
Before Scott.

311
00:50:33,677 --> 00:50:37,272
If he asks, tell him it was you

312
00:50:37,381 --> 00:50:39,542
who took care of them.

313
00:50:54,732 --> 00:50:57,462
The things you have to do for relatives.

314
00:51:11,415 --> 00:51:13,076
Hey, gentkemen!

315
00:51:35,305 --> 00:51:36,932
Shall we go on?

316
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:14,939
You see, over there are three more.

317
00:52:16,447 --> 00:52:19,575
Want to ask i f they're going to
let you pass?

318
00:52:21,118 --> 00:52:24,554
No, you don't feel like
making conversation.

319
00:52:27,491 --> 00:52:28,981
Wait...

320
00:52:36,567 --> 00:52:37,864
Hey, gentlemen!

321
00:53:11,134 --> 00:53:13,068
Whisky's no good for me.

322
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,344
Now, if you just keep on going in that
there direction, you won't meet ayone.

323
00:53:25,449 --> 00:53:29,977
A few miles and you'll find yourself
in front of Scott's ranch.

324
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:30,984
And you?

325
00:53:31,755 --> 00:53:35,054
I'm going back to town.
I'll take the long way.

326
00:53:36,927 --> 00:53:39,896
I wouldn't want to meet up
with any trouble!

327
00:54:15,232 --> 00:54:16,426
Howdy.

328
00:55:33,343 --> 00:55:36,176
He's not one of the guests.

329
00:55:37,014 --> 00:55:38,606
I suppose not.

330
00:55:58,068 --> 00:55:59,194
I remember as if it were yesterday.
There he was, a grown man.

331
00:55:59,302 --> 00:56:00,633
And he'd never in his life been in a big
town. He was so confused and flabbergasted

332
00:56:00,737 --> 00:56:03,365
that he mounted his horse and headed
straight back for the desert.

333
00:56:05,075 --> 00:56:07,771
Yes I remember him vaguely.

334
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,439
Why, you weren't even born then.

335
00:56:42,879 --> 00:56:45,279
I... I have to talk to you,
Mister Scott.

336
00:56:45,649 --> 00:56:49,483
Young man, as you can very well see,
I've got guests.

337
00:56:49,586 --> 00:56:52,555
I'd be glad to listen to you
some other day.

338
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:54,757
Now, if you'll excuse me...

339
00:56:59,596 --> 00:57:02,565
Well?

340
00:57:03,533 --> 00:57:04,727
Didn't you hear?

341
00:57:06,903 --> 00:57:07,892
Get out!

342
00:59:11,695 --> 00:59:14,027
Go on, give it to him!
Give it to him!

343
00:59:56,006 --> 00:59:57,200
You're doing fine.

344
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:00,008
I must say, he's very obstinate.

345
01:00:10,487 --> 01:00:11,954
It serves him right!

346
01:00:18,161 --> 01:00:19,185
May I?

347
01:00:27,938 --> 01:00:28,495
That's enough!

348
01:00:28,605 --> 01:00:29,765
No, Mister Scott,

349
01:00:30,206 --> 01:00:31,764
he must get up by himself.

350
01:00:38,682 --> 01:00:40,206
Had enough?

351
01:01:03,139 --> 01:01:04,128
That's enough!

352
01:01:04,541 --> 01:01:07,032
You can't whip him like a dog!

353
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,171
Mr. Scott says that's enough.

354
01:01:50,653 --> 01:01:51,813
I'll be back...

355
01:02:14,444 --> 01:02:15,433
Tom!

356
01:02:28,691 --> 01:02:31,125
I'll see Mister Scott tomorrow.

357
01:02:31,227 --> 01:02:33,286
He had some guests for dinner today.

358
01:02:33,396 --> 01:02:35,455
Junior's good with a whi p, ain't he?

359
01:02:38,802 --> 01:02:41,794
Tom, come to bed.

360
01:02:47,877 --> 01:02:52,280
You mustn't see that man again,
Tom, you mustn't.

361
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:56,078
Leave right away. Do it for
your poor mother and for me.

362
01:02:56,286 --> 01:03:00,279
Tom, get out of here quick!

363
01:05:16,359 --> 01:05:18,327
Get away, you!

364
01:05:54,931 --> 01:05:56,023
I'll come wi th you...

365
01:06:09,379 --> 01:06:11,176
What have the Scotts got against us?

366
01:06:11,281 --> 01:06:13,476
Scott killed my father.

367
01:06:17,353 --> 01:06:19,048
No one ever told me that...

368
01:06:20,823 --> 01:06:23,257
our father had been killed by Scott.

369
01:06:23,793 --> 01:06:27,354
It was my father he killed.

370
01:07:46,342 --> 01:07:49,209
Who's that up there?
Is Scott with them?

371
01:07:49,846 --> 01:07:52,576
I can't tell from here.
We're just going to have to find out.

372
01:07:52,682 --> 01:07:54,149
Come on.

373
01:08:16,839 --> 01:08:17,669
This way!

374
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:48,967
Hey, gentlemen!

375
01:08:53,543 --> 01:08:56,171
Mister Scott wants to see you!

376
01:08:56,345 --> 01:09:01,442
Nothing doing! Let him come here so
I can put a bullet between his eyes.

377
01:09:02,285 --> 01:09:04,947
Scott is your father.

378
01:09:15,765 --> 01:09:18,165
Mister Scott told me to tell you

379
01:09:18,267 --> 01:09:19,996
that he has to speak to you about
something very important in person.

380
01:09:34,884 --> 01:09:37,876
Come out, Tom!
I have to talk to you!

381
01:09:38,154 --> 01:09:39,178
Please!

382
01:10:06,983 --> 01:10:08,974
It was me who sent for you.

383
01:10:09,085 --> 01:10:11,349
I told Carradine to look for you.

384
01:10:12,121 --> 01:10:14,282
I want you to come live wi th me.

385
01:10:14,557 --> 01:10:16,081
We've been separated too long.

386
01:10:16,192 --> 01:10:18,353
Ask that rat,
your father, about Mercedes!

387
01:10:18,461 --> 01:10:20,895
I don't know anything,
I swear i t!

388
01:10:21,464 --> 01:10:24,194
I'll get the murderers,
I promise you.

389
01:10:25,268 --> 01:10:27,862
Come wi th me.
Everything,

390
01:10:28,671 --> 01:10:31,731
all I have,
belongs to you, my son.

391
01:10:32,775 --> 01:10:35,642
Junior is mad...

392
01:12:31,594 --> 01:12:33,585
Now I understand everything.

393
01:12:34,964 --> 01:12:36,795
Everything make sense?

394
01:12:38,234 --> 01:12:43,331
Scott sent for me. Junior killed
Carradine and then Mercedes.

395
01:12:44,473 --> 01:12:45,804
Mercedes knew.

396
01:12:48,144 --> 01:12:48,974
Yes.

397
01:12:51,147 --> 01:12:53,877
Junior wanted the 
whole ranch for himself,

398
01:12:54,750 --> 01:13:00,017
and when he realized that a part or all of
it was suddenly slipping out of his hands

399
01:13:03,426 --> 01:13:05,155
he killed his father.

400
01:13:07,229 --> 01:13:09,163
And I'll kill him...

401
01:13:25,214 --> 01:13:27,774
Aren't you going to come along
with me, Jeff?

402
01:13:28,084 --> 01:13:31,110
Revenging Scott isn't
any business of mine.

403
01:13:32,588 --> 01:13:34,215
What would you do in my place?

404
01:13:34,857 --> 01:13:36,825
I'm not i n your place.

405
01:13:38,594 --> 01:13:42,690
Even if it costs me my life,
Junior will pay for this.

406
01:13:43,032 --> 01:13:46,490
He's your brother,
do what you like with him.

407
01:15:15,457 --> 01:15:16,287
Hey!

408
01:15:16,792 --> 01:15:18,419
I've changed my mind!

409
01:15:18,527 --> 01:15:20,461
I want to make sure you don't give
your brother any special treatment!

410
01:15:23,132 --> 01:15:24,599
See you at the ranch!

411
01:15:55,464 --> 01:15:57,557
You attack from outside,
and me from the inside.

412
01:15:57,766 --> 01:15:58,425
>From inside?

413
01:15:58,534 --> 01:15:59,626
I'm going now.

414
01:16:00,236 --> 01:16:02,227
You keep shooting,
and from different places.

415
01:16:02,338 --> 01:16:04,704
Make them think that we're together.

416
01:16:04,807 --> 01:16:07,332
Shoot with the rifle
and the pistol, both. Get it?

417
01:16:07,776 --> 01:16:08,538
I get you.

418
01:16:08,644 --> 01:16:09,633
I'll see you later.

419
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:03,172
Hey, gentlemen!

420
01:20:10,919 --> 01:20:12,352
A little politeness
will get you anything.

421
01:20:22,831 --> 01:20:24,230
This way, quick!

422
01:21:01,270 --> 01:21:02,862
You! Go that way!

423
01:22:00,696 --> 01:22:01,424
Hey, gentlemen!

424
01:22:54,816 --> 01:22:56,306
Hey, excuse me!

425
01:22:57,419 --> 01:22:58,317
You take him!

426
01:23:11,033 --> 01:23:13,729
You go out there.
I'll cover your back.

427
01:25:39,681 --> 01:25:42,946
It's family business.
It's up to you.

428
01:26:51,653 --> 01:26:53,086
You can't kill your brother!

429
01:27:12,007 --> 01:27:18,776
You left to find a pot of gold

430
01:27:20,248 --> 01:27:25,618
A thousand miles you rode alone
All a lone

431
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:31,886
The long and lonely way
will not lead you anywhere

432
01:27:31,993 --> 01:27:39,365
You'll come back home, someday
You'll come back home, someday.

433
01:27:41,102 --> 01:27:47,530
The wind will steal your pot of gold

434
01:27:48,343 --> 01:27:53,576
And fill your eyes with burning sand,
bitter sand

435
01:27:53,682 --> 01:27:59,917
No star will show the way
And no one will hear your prayer

436
01:28:00,021 --> 01:28:07,223
You'll come back home, someday
You'll come back home, someday.

437
01:28:08,597 --> 01:28:17,869
You went away forever
You went away a lone

438
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:33,010
But someone's always waitin'
for you at home, today

439
01:28:47,535 --> 01:28:54,031
No star will show the way
And no one will hear your

440
01:28:54,142 --> 01:29:01,514
You'll come back home, someday
You'll come back home, someday.

441
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:11,948
You went away forever
You went away a lone

442
01:29:12,761 --> 01:29:27,506
But someone's always waitin'
for you at home, today
