1
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:25,154
I say to you, I tell you, a tornado...

2
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,393
I say a tornado, that's a terrible thing.

3
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:30,256
A terrible thing.

4
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,327
I saw a little town in Idaho.

5
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,960
Pretty and green in the grass,
looked like it would live forever.

6
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:41,172
Saw that same town, the same night,
after a tornado blew through that place.

7
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:46,645
Why, there wasn't a single blade of grass,
or even one tired little buttercup.

8
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,975
And everybody gone.

9
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,039
The men ran north
and the women ran south.

10
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:52,175
The dogs ran east and the cats ran west.

11
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,982
Nobody left in that town but a little boy...

12
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:57,380
calling down the main street.

13
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:00,121
"Bowser." He was calling for his dog.

14
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:03,887
"Bowser. Where's my little dog Bowser?"

15
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:07,661
Hello, tornado. Goodbye, town.

16
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,164
We ain't never had a tornado here.

17
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,726
That's what they said in Idaho.

18
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,932
Said it in the morning,
tornado came at night.

19
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,804
What do you call that there pole?

20
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:19,038
I'm mighty glad you asked me, mister.
Mighty glad indeed.

21
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,940
I call it a tornado rod.

22
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:24,606
You nail it on your roof,
let that pinwheel turn in the breeze...

23
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,447
and I warranty and I guarantee...

24
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:29,682
if this here pretty little town
ever gets hit by a tornado...

25
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,987
it'll blow through here
like a gentle spring breeze.

26
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:36,729
And the thinnest little birch tree,
it'll bend over dancing...

27
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:40,030
and spring right back up again
on its two little feet.

28
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,001
- That's him, Sheriff.
- Like to hold it, little girl?

29
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,700
You see that, folks?
Light enough for a little girl to hold on to.

30
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,900
And now, hear me!

31
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:56,114
I want you to know that this first
tornado rod goes absolutely free...

32
00:01:56,616 --> 00:02:00,074
to this pretty little girl,
if she'll tell me her name.

33
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,689
My name's Starbuck, honey. What's yours?

34
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,493
Belinda.

35
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:13,828
From me to you, Belinda.
To remember me by.

36
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:15,894
Now, that's the first one.

37
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,994
The next one ain't gonna cost $100!

38
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,266
No, sirree, it's not gonna cost you $50.

39
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,408
It is gonna cost you one quarter.

40
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:27,139
Twenty-five cents, one-fourth part of $1.
Two bits. Now, who gets it?

41
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:28,202
I'll take it.

42
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,215
Very well. Pass that down.
Let the money go.

43
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,217
The next one's gonna cost you 50 cents.

44
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,150
Hurry up. Act fast. The price is going up.

45
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,552
- Fifty cents, half a dollar.
- I'll take it!

46
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:37,749
- Who is it?
- Me.

47
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,815
Right there for the gent, please. Thank you.

48
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,919
The next one's gonna cost $1.
$1, $2, $3, $4.

49
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,294
- Hurry up, there won't be no more.
- Starbuck.

50
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,129
- Your name Starbuck?
- Get him, he's a con man.

51
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,201
There they go.

52
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,381
Hey, he's gone.

53
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:11,821
Everybody after him! Clear the square!

54
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,950
Don't let him get away. Come on.

55
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,291
So long, Belinda.

56
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,209
Whoa, boy.

57
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,288
Jimmy won the prize.

58
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,921
- Jimmy won the prize.
- Hey, Jimmy.

59
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,589
You won it easy, Jimmy.

60
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,887
- Is this here roadster yours?
- Sure is.

61
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,529
- How many cylinders?
- Five.

62
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:23,169
- How tall are you?
- 6'.

63
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:26,406
That's pretty tall.

64
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:29,904
Ain't short.

65
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,380
It's a nice height for a fellow to be.

66
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,247
I wouldn't be nothing else.

67
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,047
I was watching you at the dance.

68
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,453
You dance like you were gonna bust.

69
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,023
Feel like I'm gonna bust.

70
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,660
- You visiting?
- The Maguires.

71
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,704
- They're my cousins.
- Hey, Jimmy, come on.

72
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,272
Your name's Snookie.

73
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,179
Yours is Jim Curry.

74
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:08,250
No, I seen you three times last week
and four times this week.

75
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,347
- Seven times altogether.
- Altogether.

76
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,354
Why didn't you talk?

77
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,254
Didn't have nothing to say.

78
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,471
- You always wear that little red hat?
- No law says that I can't.

79
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,379
- Gonna wear it all your life?
- Nope.

80
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:39,410
I'm gonna give it to some handsome fellow.
That's when, as, and if.

81
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,025
- Did you say five cylinders?
- Yeah.

82
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,931
- You say 6'?
- Yeah.

83
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,401
Like to see how she runs?

84
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:06,907
Yeah.

85
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,023
Jim Curry!

86
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,762
If you're looking for your brother,
just seen him go out...

87
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,066
and Snookie Maguire after him.

88
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,934
- Find Jim, Noah?
- No, I didn't, Pop.

89
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,809
Phil says he come out with Snookie Maguire.

90
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,972
If Jim comes back, will you
tell him we went down to the depot...

91
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,141
- to meet Lizzie's train?
- Yeah, I'll tell him.

92
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,480
But seems to me,
if Jimmy's found a girlfriend...

93
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,043
he ain't gonna waste no time
meeting his sister.

94
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:52,022
- Let's go, Noah.
- No, I'm gonna find that kid.

95
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:56,059
When Lizzie gets off that train,
I sure hope she got what she went for, H.C.

96
00:09:56,162 --> 00:10:00,462
- Like what?
- Like a husband, maybe.

97
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,226
No offense, just friendly.

98
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,900
- Where'd you find him?
- He was parked with Snookie Maguire.

99
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,369
What of it?

100
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,373
What of it? You could have got yourself
in a hatful of trouble.

101
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,875
- Well, what kind of trouble, Noah?
- That girl.

102
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,572
I tell you, Pop,
her hair is so bleached blond...

103
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,376
- It ain't bleached.
- Don't tell me.

104
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,075
She's been in town less than a week...

105
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,675
and Gil Denby says she's bought two pints
of peroxide.

106
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,813
Well, what's that?
I use peroxide for a cut finger.

107
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,818
Well, if she got cut that often,
she'd bleed to death.

108
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,860
- What happened?
- I'll tell you what happened.

109
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,623
They were out in the car,
so twisted up together...

110
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,495
that I couldn't tell where he left off
and Snookie began.

111
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,228
If I hadn't come along,
heck knows what would've happened.

112
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:13,533
Heck knows I might have come home
with her little red hat.

113
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,238
With her what?

114
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:22,914
Nothing.

115
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:27,241
Do you know what trouble you can
get yourself into with a girl like that?

116
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,617
You think you're smart enough
to handle it yourself?

117
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,680
I ain't saying I'm smart.

118
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:35,754
I don't mind you telling me
how to do and how to figure things out.

119
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,487
I just wish you wouldn't holler!

120
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,024
There she comes.

121
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:48,496
Now, remember, Jimmy,
when Lizzie gets off the train, no questions.

122
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,742
- Well, how'll we know how she made out?
- No questions.

123
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,109
I won't ask no dumb questions, Pop.

124
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,238
I'll just say:

125
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:59,250
"Lizzie, which one of Uncle Ned's sons
looks like the marrying kind?"

126
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,248
Yeah, that'll fool her.

127
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,575
Pop!

128
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,239
Lizzie!

129
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,405
Hiya, Lizzie.

130
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,311
It's so great to have you back, Lizzie!

131
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:37,878
How was the trip, Lizzie?

132
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,289
Fine. Everything was fine.

133
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,817
- I brought you a present, Pop.
- Pop means at Uncle Ned's.

134
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:47,294
- How was it at Uncle Ned's?
- Fine, Jimmy. Everything was fine.

135
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,663
I brought you one, too.

136
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,567
Don't eat it all in one night.
You might get sick.

137
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,867
Here's yours, Noah.
The pen is filled with red ink.

138
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,069
Which one of Uncle Ned's sons
looks like the marrying...

139
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:20,130
Home again. It doesn't seem like a week.

140
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,998
More like a year.

141
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,944
Everything right where it was. Every...

142
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,215
Everything just like home.

143
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,892
- Now, Pop. Can we...
- No, not now.

144
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,889
Looks like you made out fine, Pop.

145
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,666
Dishes all washed,
no dirty pans on the stove.

146
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,224
You should have seen the place
while you was gone.

147
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,761
Filthy. Dishes stacked up in the sink
that high every day.

148
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,308
- Ain't that right, boys?
- Sure, that's right.

149
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,310
I washed the dishes every night.
What are you talking about?

150
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:09,040
Looks like the trip perked you up real good.

151
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:12,675
When you left here, you were looking
all dragged out by the heat.

152
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,410
What was it like in Sweet River?

153
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,918
- Hotter than hell.
- Now, you quit that.

154
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,016
I don't see nothing funny
in her talking like a cowhand.

155
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:24,290
I'm sorry, Noah. That's all the conversation
I've heard for a week.

156
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,230
How's Uncle Ned, Lizzie? And Aunt Ivy?

157
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,961
- Yeah. How's all them boys?
- Big.

158
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,334
Well, if they take after Aunt Ivy,
I'll bet they talked your ear off.

159
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,101
No, they take after Uncle Ned.
They just grunt.

160
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,912
Who got to be
the best looking of the boys, Lizzie?

161
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,782
I guess Pete.

162
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:49,484
I never could get those boys straight.
Which one is Pete?

163
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:54,923
- He's the one with the yellow hair.
- Yellow hair? Hey, that's nice on a man.

164
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:58,020
- It's honest.
- Pete's honest, all right.

165
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,664
The way you say it,
I bet you liked him the best.

166
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,830
Yeah, I'm crazy about Pete.

167
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,401
He asked me to marry him.

168
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,638
- Is that true, Lizzie?
- Word of honor.

169
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,437
Well, what'd you tell him?

170
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,874
I told him I would as soon as he graduates
from grammar school.

171
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,608
Grammar school?

172
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,574
Well, is he that dumb?

173
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,976
No, Pete's not dumb. He's only 9 years old.

174
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,052
Look, Pop, let's not beat around the bush.

175
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:29,255
I know why you sent me to Sweet River,
because Uncle Ned's got six boys.

176
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,456
Three of them are old enough
to get married, and so am I.

177
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:38,101
Well, I'm sorry you went to all that expense:
The railroad ticket and all those new clothes.

178
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,305
Noah, you can write it in the books
in red ink.

179
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,765
I'm sorry, the trip didn't work.

180
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,442
- Lizzie, that ain't what we sent you for.
- Jimmy, please.

181
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,880
She's right. That's what we sent her for.
Nothing come of it.

182
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,617
What I want to know is
why did nothing come of it?

183
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:57,053
- Let it alone, Noah.
- No, Pop, an investment's an investment.

184
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:02,323
If we put money in a heifer and she don't
turn out, we got to ask questions.

185
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,955
- That's very well put, Noah.
- What happened in Sweet River, Lizzie?

186
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:11,998
Nothing.

187
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,308
That's the awful thing.

188
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,037
Just nothing at all.

189
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,207
What did you do? Where'd you go?

190
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:28,649
The first three or four days I was there,
I stayed in my room, mostly.

191
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,550
Why'd you do that?

192
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,216
- Because I was embarrassed.
- Embarrassed about what?

193
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,692
Noah, use your head.
I knew what I was there for...

194
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,558
and that whole family knew it, too.

195
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:40,029
I couldn't stand the way
they were looking me over.

196
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,660
So I'd go downstairs for my meals,
and then I'd rush right back to my room.

197
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,068
I packed, unpacked,
washed my hair a dozen times...

198
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,766
read the <i>Sears Roebuck Catalog</i>
from cover to cover.

199
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,538
Finally, I said to myself,
"Lizzie Curry, snap out of this."

200
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,575
It was a Saturday night
and they were all going to the rodeo dance.

201
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,552
So I got myself all decked out in my
highest heels and my lowest cut dress...

202
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:05,089
and I walked down to that supper table...

203
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,626
and those boys looked at me
as if I was stark naked.

204
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:14,828
For the longest while, there wasn't a sound
except Uncle Ned slopping his soup.

205
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:19,300
And then suddenly, like a gunshot,
I heard Ned Jr. Say:

206
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,902
"Lizzie, how much do you weigh?"

207
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,464
What did you say to that?

208
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,705
I said I weight 119 pounds,
my teeth are all my own...

209
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,974
and I stand 17 hands high.

210
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,609
That wasn't very smart of you.
He was just trying to open the conversation.

211
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,709
Well, I guess I closed it.

212
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,280
And then about 10 minutes later...

213
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:40,154
little Pete came hurrying
in to the supper table.

214
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:43,553
He was carrying a geography book,
and he said:

215
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,960
"Hey, Pop, where's Madagascar?"

216
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:50,193
Well, everybody ventured an opinion
and they were all dead wrong.

217
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,326
And suddenly I heard myself say:

218
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,698
"It's an island in the Indian Ocean
off the coast of Africa...

219
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:58,140
"right opposite Mozambique."

220
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:05,478
Can I help it if I was good in geography?

221
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,274
What happened?

222
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,020
Nothing. Not a doggone thing.

223
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,424
And then I heard Ned Jr.'s voice:

224
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:16,086
"Lizzie, you fixing to be a schoolmarm?"

225
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,129
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

226
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,994
Well, from that time on,
I knew it was no go...

227
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,898
so I didn't go to the rodeo dance.

228
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:28,770
I stayed home and made up poems
about what was on sale at Sears, Roebuck.

229
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,544
- You and little Pete, huh?
- Yeah, me and little Pete.

230
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,504
And you know the funniest thing.

231
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,817
The day I left Sweet River,
little Pete was crying...

232
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,774
and he said to me:

233
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:45,852
"Lizzie, you're the beautifulest girl
I ever saw."

234
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,156
And he's right, you are.

235
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,395
Yeah, I'm beautiful to you,
and I'm beautiful to Pete.

236
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:55,593
- But I'm plain to the big brothers.
- Because you didn't show yourself right.

237
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:59,894
- I tried, Pop. I tried.
- No, you didn't. You hid behind your books.

238
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:03,964
You hid behind your eyeglasses
that you don't even wear no more.

239
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,436
You're afraid of being beautiful.

240
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:10,170
I'm afraid to think I am, and I know I'm not.

241
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,375
I'm sorry.

242
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,412
I let you all down. I'm sorry.

243
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,014
You didn't do anything of the kind, Lizzie.

244
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,658
Not a sign of a cloud.

245
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:30,992
No rain tomorrow.

246
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,335
- I guess I'll go to bed.
- Goodnight, Noah.

247
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:45,046
- Me, too.
- Goodnight, Jimmy.

248
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,493
- Well, I think I'll go to bed, too.
- Yeah.

249
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:11,067
- Welcome home, Lizzie.
- Thank you, Pop.

250
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,311
Look at them cattle.

251
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,855
Down and out.

252
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,060
That makes 12 steers we lost out here.

253
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,453
- And 62 in the gully.
- Yeah.

254
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,522
And nothing we can do about it.

255
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:10,695
What's that?

256
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,006
Howdy.

257
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,681
- Need any help?
- Who are you?

258
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:31,086
My name's Starbuck. Starbuck's the name.

259
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:34,023
- What can we do for you?
- That's the wrong question, mister.

260
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:36,788
The question is, what can I do for you?

261
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,761
I don't remember we called for anybody
to do anything.

262
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:42,356
Well, you should have, mister.
You sure should have.

263
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,561
What are you going to do
about them cattle?

264
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,503
If there's something we could do,
you think we wouldn't do it?

265
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:48,800
Well, maybe you can't.

266
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,138
- You can, I suppose.
- Maybe.

267
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:52,971
What's your game, mister?

268
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:58,574
Well, I can see you're not ready for help.
Not yet. Giddyup.

269
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:02,182
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Later, boy. Maybe I'll see you later.

270
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,298
- Morning, Noah, Pop, Jim.
- Good morning, Lizzie.

271
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,769
- Morning, honey.
- Morning, Lizzie.

272
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,199
Sure is good to be home again.

273
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,504
Yeah, just what the boys were saying.

274
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,874
- "Sure is good to have Lizzie home again."
- Yeah.

275
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,845
So they don't have to eat my cooking.

276
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,405
I didn't say that, Pop.
I like the way you cook.

277
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,781
Everything sloshed on nice and greasy.

278
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:38,187
- How do you want your eggs, Jim?
- Any old way.

279
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,554
- How many?
- Five or six will do.

280
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:44,252
He ain't so hungry today.

281
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:50,826
I dreamed we had a rain, a great big rain.

282
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:51,960
Did you, Lizzie?

283
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,733
A thunderstorm, rain coming down in sheets.

284
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,435
The lightning flashed and the thunder rolled
up and down the canyon...

285
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,536
like a kid with a big drum.
And I looked up...

286
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:05,138
and I laughed and I yelled.
It was wonderful.

287
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,718
Drought's drought and a dream's a dream.

288
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,551
But it was a nice dream, Noah.
And near as good as rain.

289
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,622
Near ain't rain.

290
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:18,853
No, I guess it isn't.

291
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,128
Lizzie, me and the boys
put our heads together...

292
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:28,070
and we thought we'd mention
something to you.

293
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,976
- Do you want to tell her about it, Noah?
- Nope, it's your idea, Pop.

294
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:36,539
Well, the boys and me...

295
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:39,715
we figured to ride into Three Point
this afternoon.

296
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,954
We're going to the Sheriff's office
and we're gonna talk to his deputy.

297
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:51,819
- File?
- Yup. Why?

298
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:58,201
Pop, that's the craziest idea.

299
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,329
I'm just gonna invite him to supper, Lizzie.

300
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:04,341
- Well, if you do, I won't be here.
- Why? Don't you like him?

301
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,070
Sure, I like him.

302
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:10,240
I like the way he looks, as if he's got
something to say but he won't say it.

303
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:13,113
I like the way he tucks his thumbs
into his belt.

304
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:16,878
But that doesn't mean I want you
to go out and lasso him for me.

305
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:19,115
I won't do anything of the kind.

306
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:22,155
We'll start talking about
a poker game, maybe...

307
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,990
and then we'll get around to supper.

308
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:27,589
Before you know it, he'll be sitting
at the head of the dining room table.

309
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,396
No, not File.
He doesn't even know I'm on Earth.

310
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:33,527
- He knows, Lizzie. He knows.
- No, he doesn't.

311
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:37,041
Whenever we drive into town,
he's got a big hello for you, Noah, and Jim.

312
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,076
But he's got nothing at all for me.

313
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,375
He just barely sneaks his hat off his head.

314
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:45,141
He makes a point of ignoring me.

315
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:49,443
When a man makes a point of ignoring you,
he ain't ignoring you at all.

316
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,560
- What do you think, Noah?
- Don't ask him.

317
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:01,258
Every time you and Jim have to scratch
your back, you turn and ask Noah.

318
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,267
The three of us, we get carried away.

319
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:07,738
- For once in your life, get carried away.
- Pop, don't get mad. Well, Noah?

320
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,467
- It's a matter of pride.
- What is pride, anyway?

321
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,712
- Is that what it is, Lizzie?
- Pride.

322
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,079
I ran out of that a long time ago.

323
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:26,048
I just want to be a woman.

324
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,421
You are a woman, without being married.

325
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,927
No, I'm not, Noah.
I'm a very good housekeeper.

326
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:35,490
I mend your socks and I wash Pop's shirts.
I'm one of the best cooks in Three Point.

327
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,333
But that's not all there is to being a woman.

328
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,530
- What more do you want?
- I want...

329
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:48,510
I want to make somebody happy.

330
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:53,616
I want somebody to be glad he found me...

331
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,153
the way I'll be glad I found him.

332
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:59,983
I want him to be able to tell me who he is...

333
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,891
and to tell me who I am, too.

334
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,930
Because heaven knows,
I have no idea who I am.

335
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:11,591
And I want to be able to do things
for him...

336
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,696
all kinds of things,
and he never has to say thank you...

337
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:17,708
because thank you
is our whole life together.

338
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:28,150
I guess it comes down to one thing,
to make somebody happy.

339
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,248
And it might be File.

340
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,450
So if you want to ask him,
go ahead and ask him.

341
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:36,221
Okay. Come on, boys.

342
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,320
Let's go, Noah.

343
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:48,628
- Will you listen to me, File?
- Now, look here, Sheriff.

344
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:51,569
Look, when I was broke,
you lent me money.

345
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,678
When I needed a job,
you made me your deputy.

346
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,112
When I catch a cold,
you bring me a mustard plaster.

347
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,650
Now you want to give me a dog.
I don't want a dog.

348
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,016
How do you know you don't want him
till you see him?

349
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:04,988
- I've seen dogs before.
- Not this one. He's different.

350
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:09,618
When you see this little fellow, you'll want
to reach right out and hug him to death.

351
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:12,754
- Think I will, huh?
- Yes, you will. He's real loving.

352
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:19,731
When you're sitting in your bare feet,
he'll come over and lick your big toe.

353
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,972
Sounds real homey. I'll do without him.

354
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:27,637
File, you make me disgusted.

355
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,980
Ain't right for you to be shacking up
by yourself...

356
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,749
especially since once you've been married.

357
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,286
You lose your wife, the nights get darn cold.

358
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:39,289
Got to have something warm
up against your backside.

359
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,450
Last night was 104 degrees.

360
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:43,619
All right, if you don't want the dog...

361
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:46,220
if you're the kind of fellow
that don't like animals...

362
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,959
- I like animals.
- You liked animals, you'd have animals.

363
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,969
- I've had them.
- I'll bet. What kind?

364
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:55,531
- When I was a kid, I had a dog.
- What kind was it?

365
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,937
Mongrel, just a kid's kind.

366
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,738
- What'd you call him?
- Dog.

367
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:03,045
- I mean, what was his name?
- Dog.

368
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:05,782
- Didn't you have no name for him?
- Dog.

369
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:10,454
- His name was Dog.
- Ain't no fitting name for no dog.

370
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,683
Well, he always came when I called him.

371
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:16,193
You couldn't have liked him very much
if you didn't even give him a name.

372
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:19,662
Sure, liked him a lot.
Took good care of him, too.

373
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,260
Lot better than he took of himself.

374
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:27,896
- Why? What happened to him?
- Was always running away.

375
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,206
Dumb little mutt run under a buckboard.

376
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:35,001
You figure everything is gonna run away
or get run over.

377
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,546
I don't know.

378
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,308
I don't want another dog.

379
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,092
- Sleeps on your feet, huh?
- Right on my feet.

380
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,565
Right on my big old stinking feet.

381
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,426
See you later, File.

382
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:25,054
- 6' tall and twice as handsome.
- Hey, Snookie.

383
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,489
- Come on, Jimmy.
- Howdy do?

384
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,533
Jimmy, come on.

385
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,261
When he says giddyup, you've got to go?

386
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,066
Snookie, don't be mad.

387
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:38,001
Go on, Jimmy. I ain't mad.

388
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:42,378
6' tall and twice as handsome.

389
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:58,924
- Hi, boys.
- Hi, File.

390
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,988
- Hi, H.C.
- Hiya, File.

391
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:04,793
Riding over, you boys see any sign of rain?

392
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:06,268
Not a spit.

393
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,100
What's it like at Sweet River?

394
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,404
How'd we know?
We ain't been to Sweet River.

395
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,847
The Sheriff said Lizzie's been to Sweet River.

396
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:22,148
- Well, yeah.
- What's it like?

397
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:26,153
- Dry.
- How'd Lizzie like it in Sweet River?

398
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:29,086
- Fine. She liked it fine.
- Yeah, she liked it fine.

399
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,028
Three barn dances and a rodeo
and a summer fair...

400
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,631
- and larking all over the place.
- Yeah.

401
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,846
File, how's your poker?

402
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,578
- My what?
- Poker.

403
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:59,015
- I don't care for poker very much, H.C.
- You don't?

404
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,849
Don't you like Spit in the Ocean?

405
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:04,417
Gave up playing cards a long time ago, Jim.

406
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,328
You did, huh?

407
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,161
What about...

408
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:14,137
Hey, File, what's that hanging down
from your shirt?

409
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:22,580
- That looks like a needle.
- Yeah, it sure does.

410
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,975
What's the matter, your shirt tore?

411
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,612
Well, looks like it.

412
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:30,347
- Fix it yourself, do you?
- Sure do.

413
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,182
I wouldn't say that, Jim.

414
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,455
Been fixing my own shirts ever since
I was a widower back in Pedleyville.

415
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,498
Lizzie fixes all of my shirts.

416
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,798
- Sure nice to have a sister.
- Or something.

417
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:56,302
Yeah, Lizzie come back from Sweet River
by herself?

418
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:59,407
Sure. She went there by herself, didn't she?

419
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,048
That don't mean anything.

420
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,417
I went over to Leverstown
to buy myself a mare.

421
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,547
Went by myself,
but I came back with a mare.

422
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:09,081
Well, Lizzie didn't go to buy nothing.
Get it, File? Nothing.

423
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,594
Now, don't get ornery, Jim.

424
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:15,326
- I just asked a friendly question.
- Sure, just a friendly question.

425
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:19,530
- Don't get ornery.
- I always say to Jim:

426
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:22,935
"The reason you ain't got no real friends
is 'cause you're ornery."

427
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:26,033
- You just don't know how to make friends.
- Sure, I do.

428
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,007
- Sure, I do.
- No, you don't.

429
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:31,274
You ever ask a fellow out
to have a drink? No.

430
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:35,483
You ever say to a fellow,
"Come on home and have some supper"?

431
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:48,757
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I'm sorry, File. I didn't mean to get ornery.

432
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,858
- Come on out and have a drink.
- Supper.

433
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:55,099
- Come on home and have some supper.
- I guess I'll say no to the supper, boys.

434
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,470
I'd be glad to come out
and have a drink with you.

435
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,772
We don't have time for a drink...

436
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,209
but we've been thinking that we'd
have you over for supper someday.

437
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:06,773
- I'd be glad to come one of these days.
- How about tonight?

438
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,846
I haven't got time tonight.

439
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,684
Outlaw headed this way,
fellow named Tornado Johnson.

440
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,246
I got to stick around.

441
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,417
You don't know he'll come this way, do you?

442
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,926
They say he's Three Point bound.

443
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,463
He might be down at Pedleyville
or Peak's Junction.

444
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,227
- He might even be over at our place.
- I won't be over to your place.

445
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:28,596
You said for me to be friendly. I'm trying.
But he don't want to be friendly.

446
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,732
I want to be friendly, Jim.

447
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,067
I just don't want to be married.

448
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:39,342
Who says we're inviting you over for Lizzie?
You take that back.

449
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,408
I won't take nothing back, Jim.

450
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,215
Well, take something else.

451
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,859
If I didn't think he had it coming...

452
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,399
- I'd wipe you up good and clean.
- He had it coming.

453
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,196
Yeah, I guess we all did.

454
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:01,599
Come on, turtlehead. Let's go home.

455
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,547
- I'm sorry I hit him.
- That's all right.

456
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,950
The only thing, you know,
you lost that fight.

457
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:25,359
- What?
- Yeah.

458
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,522
It wouldn't have hurt you
to come to supper.

459
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:32,330
- It might have done you some good.
- We weren't talking about supper.

460
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:36,069
That's right. We were talking about Lizzie.

461
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:40,133
And she might have done you
some good, too.

462
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:42,739
I mend my own shirts.

463
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:48,083
Seems to me you need a lot more mending
than shirts.

464
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:55,715
Wait a minute. Don't drop a word like that
and just leave it.

465
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:59,659
All right. What'd you hit him for?

466
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,988
- Threw a punch, I got mad.
- Why?

467
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:05,630
We come here and say we like you enough
to have you in our family.

468
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:07,364
Is that an insult?

469
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:11,665
- I'm doing all right by myself.
- You ain't doing all right by yourself.

470
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:15,202
A man who won't make friends
with a whole town that likes him...

471
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,146
and looks up to him, he ain't doing all right.

472
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:21,442
- And if he says he is, he's a liar.
- All right, take it easy.

473
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,646
I said a liar, and I mean it.

474
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:27,947
You talk about yourself as being a widower.
We all got respect for your feelings.

475
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,823
But you ain't a widower,
and everybody in this town knows it.

476
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:34,422
I am a widower. My wife died six years ago
back in Pedleyville.

477
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:38,435
Your wife didn't die, File. She ran out
on you, and you're a divorced man.

478
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:41,995
But we'll all go on calling you a widower
as long as you want us to.

479
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,137
Heck, it don't hurt us none.

480
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:47,802
But you, a fellow who shuts himself up
with that lie...

481
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:50,240
he needs mending.

482
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,146
You want to throw any more punches?

483
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,878
You told File 7:00, I hope.

484
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,947
We didn't tell him no exact time.

485
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:43,592
Don't walk heavy
or the lemon cake will fold.

486
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,403
Don't let Jimmy mess up the table.

487
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:53,341
- Lizzie.
- Answer the telephone, will you, Noah?

488
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,003
I'm changing my dress.

489
00:36:57,815 --> 00:36:59,305
Hello.

490
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:02,308
No, this ain't Jim, it's Noah. Who's this?

491
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,887
It's Snookie Maguire.

492
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:09,492
- Hot dog.
- What exactly do you mean, "hot dog"?

493
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,585
- Just hot dog.
- What are you gonna say to her?

494
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,721
Well, I don't know what she's gonna say
to me.

495
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,698
You watch out.

496
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,131
Hello? Hello, Snookie?

497
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:22,504
How's my 6' tall and twice as handsome?

498
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:24,506
I'm fine.

499
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:28,278
I'm just fine and dandy. How are you?

500
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,076
Fine and dandy?

501
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:33,848
I'm sure glad you're fine and dandy, too.

502
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,819
- Fine and dandy, my big foot.
- What?

503
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:41,448
You mean it, Snookie?

504
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,157
I sure hope you mean it.

505
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,128
Now, what's all this "you mean it" about?

506
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:51,134
She says it's a hot night and she's got
her car out and her motor's saying:

507
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:53,261
"Chug, chug, where's little Jimmy?"

508
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:56,363
Well, you tell her, chug, chug,
little Jimmy's gonna sit home...

509
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,169
on his fat little bottom.

510
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:06,481
Hello, Snookie. I just can't tonight.

511
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:12,548
Well, I don't know why, exactly.
Anyway, I can't talk right now.

512
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:21,559
Snookie, you still wearing your little red hat?

513
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:25,358
Hello. Hello, Snookie?

514
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:35,970
See that?

515
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,581
You go out with her once,
she starts chasing you.

516
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,140
I don't see what's wrong with that, Noah.

517
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:42,716
- You don't?
- No.

518
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:47,247
People want to get together, they ought to
get together. Don't matter how, does it?

519
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:51,117
Now, you ask yourself it don't really matter.

520
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:53,288
Go on, ask yourself, Jimmy.

521
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,026
Well, maybe it does.

522
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:00,365
Holy mackerel,
I wish I could figure things out.

523
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,813
- Where's Lizzie?
- She's upstairs.

524
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,646
Did you tell her?

525
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,928
Well, folks, how do I look?

526
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,227
Beautiful.

527
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:36,202
- Fine, just fine.
- Beautiful.

528
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:40,035
You know, Pop, I really think I am.

529
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:41,971
If you don't look too close.

530
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,038
I've decided to have beefsteak
instead of kidney pie.

531
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:47,876
I think men pretend to like mixtures...

532
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,112
but what they really like
is a plain slab of beefsteak.

533
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,549
What time do you suppose
File will get here?

534
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,889
Ought to know some time
we can start eating.

535
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,156
We can start anytime you say.

536
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:11,635
Anytime?

537
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,512
- File's not coming.
- No.

538
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:21,807
I see.

539
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:31,021
Not that he didn't want to come.
He wanted to a lot.

540
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,425
- He did, huh?
- Well, sure.

541
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:38,193
Pop said, "Come to supper tonight, File."

542
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,699
And when Pop said that...

543
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:43,867
did you notice how his face
kind of lighted up?

544
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,465
- Did you notice that?
- Yeah.

545
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:48,706
- Yes, sir. File was real friendly.
- Friendly, huh?

546
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:52,644
- What happened to your eye?
- Kind of swelled up on me.

547
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:56,047
File hit him.

548
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:59,552
You mean you fought
to get him to come here?

549
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,557
It was only a little fight, Lizzie.

550
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,593
Why didn't you make it a big one, a riot?

551
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:06,152
Why didn't you all just pile on and slug him?

552
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,597
- You're seeing this all wrong.
- I'm seeing it the way it happened.

553
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:13,262
He said, "She might be a pretty good
cook and it might be a tasty supper...

554
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:16,431
"but she's plain.
She's as plain as old shoes."

555
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:18,304
He didn't say anything like that.

556
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,502
He didn't say nothing about shoes.

557
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:28,109
I'm sorry, Lizzie. We made a mess out of it.

558
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:31,348
If you'd have taken my advice,
it wouldn't have been a mess.

559
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:35,688
I don't like being right all the time,
but for Pete's sake.

560
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,985
Well, Noah, I'm stumped.

561
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:40,561
Now, if you were Lizzie's father,
what would you do?

562
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:42,656
Who says we have to do anything?

563
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:46,801
We've been pushing her around,
trying to marry her off. Why?

564
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:50,339
What if she don't get married?
Is that the end of everything?

565
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:53,399
She's got a home, she's got a family.
She's got bed and board...

566
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:56,071
clothes on her back, plenty to eat,
everything she needs.

567
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:59,206
- She ain't got what'll make her happy.
- She ain't gonna get it.

568
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:02,616
- Because she's going at it all wrong.
- How am I? How?

569
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:06,281
Because you don't talk to a man the way
you ought to. You talk too serious.

570
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,690
If there's anything that scares a fellow,
it's a serious-talking girl.

571
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,228
That's the way Lizzie is.
She can't be anything else.

572
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:13,422
Yes, she can.

573
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:15,727
She can to the social clubs
on Wednesday nights...

574
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:17,892
and giggle and flirt as good as any of them.

575
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:20,630
What do you want her to turn into?
Lilly Ann Beasley?

576
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,730
Lilly Ann Beasley gets any man she goes for.

577
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:26,367
I saw her walk up to Phil Mackey
one morning...

578
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:29,742
and she wiggled her hips
like a cocker spaniel and she said:

579
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:32,812
"Phil Mackey, how many toes have you got?"

580
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,477
And he said, "Well, naturally, I got 10."

581
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,317
And she said, "Well, that's just
the right number of toes...

582
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,357
"for a big, strong man to have."

583
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:42,517
And pretty soon he was cooked.

584
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,663
And he started following her around,
and she got him so nervous...

585
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,391
he bust right out with the shingles.

586
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:52,128
Well, if she wants Phil Mackey,
she can have him, shingles and all.

587
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:55,096
How about that livestock fellow
from Chicago?

588
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:57,538
Can I treat a man the way she treated him?

589
00:42:57,608 --> 00:43:01,772
"Now, your polka dot tie.
I just adore men with a polka dot tie.

590
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,972
"Those little round dots
go right to my heart."

591
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:06,380
The poor fellow,
the blood rushed out of his face...

592
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,645
and I thought he'd keel over
in the horse trough.

593
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,983
I don't want to pick a man
out of a horse trough!

594
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,455
I want him to stand on his own two legs...

595
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:16,322
and I want to stand on mine
without having to trick him.

596
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:18,759
- Isn't that possible with a man?
- No, it ain't.

597
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:20,262
- Yes, it is, Lizzie.
- No.

598
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:22,765
For once in his life,
Jim said something sensible.

599
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,927
If it's a man you want, you got to get him
the way a man gets got.

600
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,904
If that's the way a man gets got,
I don't want any of them.

601
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:32,238
No, dang bust File and a-rattle snatch
all of them.

602
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:33,742
Don't use that language.

603
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:37,747
Rattle snatch, toad rump, stink drum,
clod fetch every last one of them.

604
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,076
Who opened that door?

605
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,185
Must have been the wind.

606
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:53,386
Wind? Did you say wind?

607
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:56,764
There's not a breath of wind
anywhere in the world.

608
00:43:57,434 --> 00:44:00,528
- Starbuck.
- That's the name. Right the first time.

609
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:03,730
- Lady of the house, hello.
- Hello.

610
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,173
That's a mighty nice dress.
It ought to go to a party.

611
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:07,403
Thank you.

612
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:10,947
Don't you knock on a door
before you come in?

613
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:14,447
- Who are you, anyway?
- We met him on the range this morning.

614
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:17,348
He come up to us and he said...

615
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:18,780
What did you say?

616
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:21,051
I said, "What are you gonna do
about them cattle?"

617
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,456
Listen, fellow.

618
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:25,893
If you know we lost them cattle,
you ought to know what killed them.

619
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:29,399
- Drought. Ever hear of it?
- Ever hear of it? That's all I hear.

620
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:31,457
Wherever I go,
there's a drought ahead of me.

621
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:35,232
But when I leave, behind me,
there's rain. Rain!

622
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:38,169
- I think this man's crazy.
- That's what I am, crazy.

623
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:41,678
I woke up this morning, and I looked
at the world and I said to myself:

624
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:44,213
"The world's gone completely
out of its mind.

625
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:48,615
"And the only thing that'll set it straight
is a first-class, A-number one lunatic."

626
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,281
Well, here I am, folks, crazy as a bedbug.
Did I introduce myself?

627
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,855
The name is Starbuck, rainmaker.

628
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:58,484
I read about a rainmaker.
I think it was Idaho.

629
00:44:58,562 --> 00:44:59,756
What'd you read, lady?

630
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:02,958
I can't remember whether they locked
him up or ran him out of town.

631
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,729
Might be they strung him up
on a sycamore tree.

632
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:07,665
Might be.

633
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:10,901
Look, fellow, the idea is
we don't believe in rainmakers.

634
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:13,968
What do you believe in, mister?
Dying cattle?

635
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:18,280
- You really mean you can bring rain?
- He talks too fast. He can't bring anything.

636
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:20,816
I asked him. Can you bring rain?

637
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:23,451
It's been done, brother. It's been done.

638
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:26,221
- Where? How?
- How? Sodium chloride.

639
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,258
Pitch it up high, right up to the clouds.

640
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:30,657
Electrify the cold front,
neutralize the warm front.

641
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:34,391
Barometricize the tropopause,
magnetize occlusions in the sky.

642
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:38,595
- In other words, bunk.
- Lady, you are right.

643
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:43,000
And you know why that sounds like bunk?
Because it is bunk. Bunk and hokey-pokey.

644
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:46,338
And I tell you, I'd be ashamed
to use any of those methods.

645
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:48,133
What method do you use?

646
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:50,737
My method's like my name.
It's all mine own.

647
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:53,606
- Care to hear my deal?
- We're not interested.

648
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:55,242
Not one bit.

649
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:01,055
- Any charge for listening?
- No charge. Free.

650
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,187
Go ahead. What's the deal?

651
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:10,890
$100 in advance.

652
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:13,902
And inside of 24 hours, you will have rain.

653
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:16,901
- You mean it? Real rain?
- Rain is rain, brother.

654
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,567
It comes from the sky.
It's a wetness known as water. Aqua pura.

655
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:23,938
Mammals drink it, fish swim in it,
little boys wade in it...

656
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:26,881
and the birds flap their wings
and sing like sunrise.

657
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,941
Water, I recommend it.

658
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:34,146
- Pay him the $100, Noah.
- Don't be a chump, Noah.

659
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:37,250
- Don't worry, I won't.
- How would you do it, Starbuck?

660
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,122
Now, don't ask me no questions.

661
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:41,824
Why? It's a fair question.
How will you do it?

662
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:46,198
What do you care how I do it, sister?
As long as it's done.

663
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:52,001
But I'll tell you how I do it. I'll lift this stick
and take a long swipe at the sky.

664
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:55,135
I'll let down a shower of hailstones
as big as cantaloupes.

665
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:57,680
I'll shout out some good old Nebraska
cuss words.

666
00:46:57,748 --> 00:47:00,876
You turn around and there's a lake
where your ground used to be.

667
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:02,680
Or I'll sing a little tune maybe...

668
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:06,382
and it'll sound so pretty and sound so sad,
you'll weep.

669
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,287
And your old man will weep.

670
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:13,195
And the sky will get all misty-like and shed
the prettiest tears you ever did see.

671
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,564
How will I do it, girl?

672
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,294
- I'll just do it.
- Where did you ever bring rain before?

673
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:21,467
What town? What state?

674
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:25,473
Sister, the last place I brought rain...

675
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:29,279
is now called Starbuck.
They named it after me.

676
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:33,374
Dry, I tell you. Those people didn't have
enough damp to blink their eye.

677
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,577
So I get out my big wheel
and my rolling drum...

678
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:39,213
and my hat with the three feathers in it,
and I look at the sky and say:

679
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:43,692
"Cumulus." I say, "Cumulus-nimbo.
Nimbulo-cumulus."

680
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:49,226
Pretty soon, way up there, there's a teeny
little cloud the size of a mare's tail.

681
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:52,928
Then up there there's another cloud looking
like a whitewashed chicken house.

682
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:55,437
And then I look up again,
and all of a sudden...

683
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:59,339
there's a herd of white buffalo
stampeding across the sky!

684
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:03,512
And then, sister of all good people,
down came the rain!

685
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:08,110
Rain in buckets, rain in barrels,
flooding the gullies, filling the lowland.

686
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,716
And the land is as green
as the valley of Adam.

687
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:15,723
And when I rode out of there,
I looked behind me...

688
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:18,517
and I see the prettiest colors in the sky.

689
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:21,859
Blue, green, purple, gold.

690
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:23,763
Colors to make you cry.

691
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:27,460
And me? I'm riding right through
that rainbow.

692
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:32,100
Well, how about it? Is it a deal?

693
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:37,303
- Well...
- Pop, no. He's a liar and a con man.

694
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:41,215
Yup, that's what he is all right.
A liar and a con man.

695
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:46,611
It hurts me to hear you say that, mister.
Well, so long to you.

696
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:49,550
- So long for a sorry night.
- Wait a minute.

697
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:52,390
- You said I was a con man.
- You're a liar and a con man...

698
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:54,396
but I didn't say I wouldn't take your deal.

699
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:56,022
- Pop!
- I didn't say I would, neither.

700
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,659
Pop, you ain't gonna throw away $100!

701
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:00,492
How would I write it in the books?

702
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:02,128
Write it as a gamble, Noah.

703
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:04,673
I've lost more than that in poker
on a Saturday night.

704
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:07,266
You get an even chance in poker.
That's a crazy reason.

705
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,278
I'll give you better reasons, Lizzie girl.

706
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:13,305
Take my deal because once in your life
you've got to take a chance on a con man.

707
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:16,716
Take my deal, because there's
dying cattle that might pick up and live.

708
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,153
Because $100 is only $100...

709
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:21,918
but rain in a dry season is a sight to behold.

710
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:26,062
You've got to take my deal
because it's gonna be a hot night...

711
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:30,532
and the world goes crazy on a hot night,
and maybe that's what a hot night is for.

712
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:34,463
Starbuck, you got you a deal.

713
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:37,666
I tell you, I knew I had a deal
the minute I walked in this house.

714
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:39,868
- How'd you know that?
- There's four of you...

715
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:41,535
and five places set for supper.

716
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:46,378
And I says to myself, "Bill Starbuck,
your name's written right across this chair."

717
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:49,409
Come on, let's eat.

718
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:04,033
Anything doing?

719
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:07,964
Phil Mackey said the Curry boys came by.

720
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:11,773
Says he saw Jim Curry come out of here
wearing a black eye.

721
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,333
Tell Phil Mackey to mind his own business.

722
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:18,642
- And me to mind mine?
- Well...

723
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:22,151
If you want to take time off
and run down to the Curry ranch...

724
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:24,949
and say you're sorry or something and...

725
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:28,453
I'm not apologizing to anyone.

726
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,717
Might be a little easier on the phone, huh?

727
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:35,958
- The number's five-five-ring-three.
- I'm not interested in the number.

728
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,942
Hello? Oh, yeah.

729
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,842
This is his deputy.

730
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:57,445
We've got the description of him,
but we need a picture.

731
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:01,554
No, I haven't seen him.
Somebody thought they saw his wagon.

732
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:04,753
Yeah, well, send us a picture
soon as you can, will you?

733
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,594
Okay, thanks. Bye.

734
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:21,567
Five-five-ring-three.

735
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:28,409
Never mind, Operator.

736
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:32,750
$60, $70...

737
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:36,390
$80, $85.

738
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:39,293
- I'm against this, Pop.
- Keep counting, Noah.

739
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:45,726
$90, $95, $100. There's your $100.

740
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:48,862
- Thank you, Noah.
- Don't thank me. Thank him.

741
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:52,571
I'm writing that down in my books,
$100 thrown away.

742
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:56,301
No, don't write that. Write it like this. Say:

743
00:51:58,014 --> 00:52:00,608
"On August 27...

744
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:03,618
"a man came stomping
through our doorway.

745
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:06,347
"We bid him time of night.

746
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:10,522
"We fed him a supper fit for a king...

747
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:12,221
"and we gave him 100 honest notes...

748
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:15,162
"in the fair government of
these United States of America.

749
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:19,396
"In return for that hospitality,
he did us one small favor. He brought rain."

750
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:22,529
- You got it? Write it.
- I don't see no rain yet.

751
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:26,007
- I still got 23 hours to bring it.
- Well, you better get busy.

752
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:28,601
Yeah, Starbuck, you better knuckle down.

753
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:32,139
All right. What kind of rain would you like?

754
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:36,511
- You mean we can choose our kind?
- Why, sure, you can choose your kind.

755
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:39,578
And there's all kinds.
There's mizzling and there's drizzle.

756
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:43,057
But you wouldn't want that.
I give that away as a free sample.

757
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,387
There's trickle and there's sprinkle.

758
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:48,295
That's for little flower gardens
of little pink old ladies.

759
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:50,458
There's rain with hail and rain with thunder.

760
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:54,095
There's flash flood and storms that
roll down the shoulder of a mountain.

761
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,800
But biggest of all, that's deluge.
Don't ask me for deluge.

762
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:02,004
- That takes quite a bit of doing.
- What kind do we get for $100?

763
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:03,670
You choose it, I'll bring it.

764
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:06,910
He brags so loud,
he gives me a pain in the neck.

765
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:11,719
If you all act like she does, it's gonna
make it tough for me to do my job...

766
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:14,848
because when there's suspicion around,
it's a dry season.

767
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:16,552
I don't doubt it.

768
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:20,557
Look, folks, making rain,
it takes a lot of confidence.

769
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:23,292
If you have doubts about me,
I get doubts about myself.

770
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,856
I see.

771
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:28,166
If you don't bring rain,
you're gonna blame it on us.

772
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:30,103
We didn't have confidence.

773
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:32,971
What I mean is, I may need some help.

774
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:35,304
Well, I'll help you. So will Pop.

775
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,040
How about you, lady? Any confidence?

776
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:44,348
- No confidence.
- We don't need her, Starbuck.

777
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:47,618
- Now, come on. What's the first step?
- All right.

778
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:51,417
What I'm gonna ask you to do,
it ain't gonna make much sense...

779
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:53,985
but then what's sensible
about a flood or a hurricane?

780
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,929
- Nothing.
- That's right.

781
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:57,727
What I want you to do...

782
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:02,035
you see that little old wagon of mine
out there?

783
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:04,630
On that wagon, I got me a big bass drum.

784
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,733
Somebody is got to beat that drum.

785
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,573
- Beat it? What for?
- Don't ask questions.

786
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:10,670
- And don't get sensible.
- That's right, Jimmy.

787
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,545
- Now, who's gonna beat that drum?
- Me, I'll beat it.

788
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:16,085
Jim, you're gonna be my first lieutenant.

789
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:20,886
You go out there, and every time you get
the feeling, you beat that drum three times.

790
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:26,855
- Low, like thunder. You get it?
- Got it.

791
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:29,865
- When do I start?
- Mister, you've started.

792
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,093
Hot dog.

793
00:54:33,803 --> 00:54:37,933
You pay close attention. In that wagon
of mine, I got me a bucket of white paint.

794
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:40,101
It ain't ordinary white paint, it's special.

795
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:43,168
It's electro-magnetized, oxygenated,
de-chromated white.

796
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:46,215
I want you to go out there
and paint a great, big white arrow...

797
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:48,183
pointing away from the house.

798
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:50,683
That's so the house don't get struck
by lightning.

799
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:53,222
Well, that sounds reasonable.

800
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:59,320
Now, it's too bad that you don't have
a mule on the place.

801
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:02,695
- We got a mule.
- You have? Well, that's great.

802
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:04,131
That's just dandy.

803
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:08,398
Get a length of rope, go out there
and tie the hind legs of that mule together.

804
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,167
What? Tie the hind legs of a mule?
What the heck for?

805
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:13,709
Now, please. You got to do like I ask you.

806
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:16,841
- I ain't gonna do it.
- Come on, Noah.

807
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:20,275
Well, I'll be...

808
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:24,081
Tie the hind legs of a mule!

809
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:28,785
Pop, wait. I've been sitting here
keeping my mouth shut...

810
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:33,519
wondering how far you'll go
in letting this man make a fool out of you.

811
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:37,160
He can't make me any more a fool than
I make out of myself.

812
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:41,169
You're making a big fool out of yourself.
Where's your common sense?

813
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:42,704
Common sense?

814
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:45,570
You mean, go along with this fellow
halfway, huh?

815
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:49,408
Well, I can't do that, Lizzie.
I got to take a chance on him.

816
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,078
The whole chance.

817
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:54,378
Without being afraid of getting hurt
or getting cheated...

818
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:57,782
getting laughed at. As far as he'll take me.

819
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,551
White arrow, did you say?

820
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,023
- A white arrow.
- I'll paint it.

821
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:11,258
Mister, you're gonna get
your money's worth if it's the last thing I do.

822
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:13,700
- Don't get nervous, boy.
- I ain't. Not a bit of it.

823
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:15,931
That's fine. Confidence.

824
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:26,012
Attaboy, Jim.
Beat that drum. Make it rumble.

825
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:43,858
I bet you feel real proud of yourself.

826
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:45,958
Kind of proud, sure.

827
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:48,395
You're not satisfied to steal our money.

828
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:50,837
You have to make jackasses out of us.

829
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:54,673
Why'd you send them out of there
on those fool errands? Why? What for?

830
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:08,321
Maybe I sent them out
so I could talk to you alone.

831
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:10,052
- What?
- You heard me.

832
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:13,061
Then why didn't you say it straight out:

833
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:15,996
"Lizzie, I want to talk to you alone,
man to man"?

834
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,831
Man to man, Lizzie?

835
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:21,330
Excuse me, I made a mistake.
You're not a man.

836
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:24,840
- Lizzie, can I ask you a question?
- No.

837
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:25,897
I'll ask it anyway.

838
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:28,535
What are you fussing with the buttons
on your dress for?

839
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,272
- Fussing? I'm not.
- Let them alone.

840
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:33,076
They're all buttoned up fine,
as tight as they'll ever get.

841
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:35,845
It's a nice dress, too. Brand-new, ain't it?

842
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,354
You expecting somebody?

843
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,583
None of your business.

844
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:46,921
Woman gets herself all decked out,
she must be expecting her beau.

845
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:49,462
Where is he? It's getting kind of late.

846
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:52,201
I'm not expecting anybody.

847
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:56,463
I see. You were, but now you ain't.

848
00:57:57,774 --> 00:57:59,036
Stand you up?

849
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:02,267
Mr. Starbuck, you've got more gall...

850
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:03,637
Let go of me.

851
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:06,204
When I walked into this house,
you didn't like me. Why?

852
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:08,045
- I said, let go.
- You didn't like me. Why?

853
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:10,745
Why'd you go up on your hind legs
like a frightened mare?

854
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,151
- I wasn't frightened.
- You were.

855
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:13,655
- Of you? Of what?
- I don't know.

856
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:15,247
Mares get scared by lots of things.

857
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:19,284
- Fire, lightning, the smell of blood.
- I wasn't scared, Mr. Starbuck, I was mad.

858
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:22,195
You paraded yourself in here,
you took over everything.

859
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:25,757
I don't like to be to taken by a con man.

860
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,934
- Get out of here.
- No.

861
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,231
I'm sick and tired of this.

862
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:35,141
I'm tired of you queering my work,
calling me out of my name.

863
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:37,907
I called you what you are,
a big mouth, liar, and a fake.

864
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:41,314
How do you know I'm a liar?
How do you know I'm a fake?

865
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,918
Maybe I can bring rain.

866
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:48,714
Maybe when I was born,
God whispered a special word in my ear.

867
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:52,591
Maybe he said, "Bill Starbuck,
you ain't gonna have much in this world.

868
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:55,028
"You ain't gonna have no money
and no fancy spurs...

869
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:57,123
"no white horse with a golden saddle.

870
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,328
"But, Bill Starbuck, wherever you go,
you'll bring rain."

871
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:03,530
Maybe that's my one and only blessing.

872
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:06,234
There's no such blessing in the world.

873
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:10,135
I seen even better blessings, Lizzie girl.

874
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:12,905
I got a brother who's a doctor.

875
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:16,715
You don't have to tell him where you ache
or where you pain.

876
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,447
He just walks in and he lays his hand
on your heart.

877
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:22,921
And pretty soon,
you're breathing sweet again.

878
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:24,923
I got another brother who can sing...

879
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:28,225
and when he's singing,
that song is there and never leaves you.

880
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:31,563
I used to think,
"Why I ain't I blessed like Fred or Arnie?

881
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:34,899
"Why am I just a nothing man
with nothing special to my name?"

882
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:37,235
And then one summer comes the drought.

883
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:41,407
And Fred can't heal it away,
and Arnie can't sing it away.

884
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:44,640
But me, I go down to the holler...

885
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:49,276
and I look up, and I say:

886
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:54,220
"Please, rain.

887
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:58,187
"Please, please, bring rain!"

888
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:04,592
And the rain came...

889
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:09,201
and I knew. I knew I was one of the family.

890
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,480
That's a story.

891
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:23,216
You don't have to believe it
if you don't want to.

892
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:33,128
I don't believe it!

893
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:43,099
You're like Noah.
You don't believe in nothing.

894
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,339
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

895
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,070
You're scared to believe in anything.

896
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,544
You put on the fancy dress
and the beau don't come.

897
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:53,980
So you're scared nothing will ever come.
You've got no faith.

898
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:57,650
- I've got as much as anybody.
- You don't even know what faith is.

899
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,517
I'm gonna tell you.

900
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:02,891
It's believing you see white
when your eyes tell you black.

901
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:07,191
- It's knowing with your heart.
- And I know you're a fake!

902
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,633
Lizzie, I'm sad about you.

903
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:20,366
You don't believe in nothing,
not even in yourself.

904
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,642
You don't even believe you're a woman.

905
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,775
And if you don't, you're not.

906
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:47,002
Jimmy, quit that.

907
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:11,626
Don't you feel foolish beating that drum?

908
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:13,991
Should I?

909
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:18,065
Lizzie thinks I'm making
a jackass out of you.

910
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:20,201
Is that what you think?

911
01:02:22,805 --> 01:02:25,672
You said beat the drum and it'd bring rain.

912
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:28,867
I'm beating it.

913
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,207
Just because I said so?

914
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,775
Because you said so.

915
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:56,862
What was that?

916
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,701
Sounded like thunder.

917
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:02,066
No...

918
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:04,708
too regular.

919
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:08,744
Why don't you take a run down
and see the Curry girl?

920
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:12,015
I don't want to go down and see her.
Just stand there like a stick?

921
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:15,546
- Don't stand! Sit down! Talk!
- I don't know how to talk to her!

922
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:18,286
Make up conversations,
they all jam up in my head.

923
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:20,158
Flush them out.

924
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:22,094
- Get going!
- All right!

925
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:26,694
- Mind if I take an hour off?
- Take two hours!

926
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:33,041
- Take all night!
- An hour is all I can stand.

927
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:57,391
Look at you, you'd think
you never painted anything in your life.

928
01:03:57,466 --> 01:04:00,458
- I didn't see the bush.
- What bush?

929
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:03,137
I was painting backwards
and suddenly there was...

930
01:04:03,206 --> 01:04:05,265
that darn bush and I bumped,
and the paint...

931
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:07,536
slopped all over everything.

932
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:15,413
What are you limping about?

933
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:19,616
- Mule.
- Kick you?

934
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:25,019
Bad or good, a mule's kick is a mule's kick!

935
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:30,859
For Pete's sake! Come in here
and quit beating that drum.

936
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:33,333
- I think he enjoys it.
- Sure...

937
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:36,200
he got the easiest job of all of us.

938
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:39,571
Holy mackerel, Pop.
Your face is all over whitewash.

939
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:46,545
Jimmy! Quit that!

940
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:49,380
He said to beat it every time I got
the feeling.

941
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:52,048
But, Jimmy...

942
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:55,887
if you'll just try to resist the feeling,
we'll all appreciate it.

943
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:58,984
Holy mackerel, Pop.
Your face is all over whitewash.

944
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,050
It is?

945
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:01,858
Why don't you wash up? You look foolish.

946
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:04,900
You don't look so bright, yourself,
toting that drum.

947
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:06,693
What am I gonna do with it?

948
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:09,294
For the love of Mike, don't be so dumb.

949
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:11,602
Don't call me that, Noah.

950
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:24,551
What are you doing in Lizzie's linen chest?

951
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:28,716
Starbuck asked if he could spend
the night in the tack room and I said yes.

952
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:30,850
Figured I'd get him something to sleep on.

953
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,521
Sure stressing yourself to make him cozy,
aren't you?

954
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,029
Why not?

955
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:37,497
- I like him.
- Funny, me, too.

956
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:39,830
If he wanted to sell you a bill of goods.

957
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:42,894
He didn't sell me a bill of goods.
He gave me some good advice.

958
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:45,964
- I'm gonna take it.
- What kind of advice, Jimmy?

959
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:47,470
About Snookie.

960
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:49,844
What'd he tell you?

961
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:55,072
I said to him,
"What do you think of a girl who wears...

962
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:58,609
"loud clothes
and puts lip rouge on her mouth...

963
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:02,647
"and always goes around in a little red hat?
Is she fast?"

964
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:05,755
And you know what he said?

965
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:09,291
He said, "Never judge a heifer
by the flick of her tail."

966
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,791
- Sounds like sensible advice.
- I think so.

967
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:15,937
I told you he'd sell you a bill of goods.

968
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:18,673
I understand that crack, Noah.

969
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:22,542
You mean he was trying
to make me feel smart, and I ain't.

970
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:24,579
- Shut up.
- I won't shut up.

971
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:28,608
What the devil's got into you?

972
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:33,380
I just found something out, Noah.

973
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:36,152
You know, the only time I feel real dumb?

974
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:40,127
When I'm talking to you.
Now, why the heck is that, Noah?

975
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:48,928
Hello, who?

976
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,537
He's not here.

977
01:06:57,213 --> 01:07:00,580
- Who was that?
- Who else would have all that gall?

978
01:07:01,984 --> 01:07:02,973
Snookie.

979
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:06,779
Come on, that phone call was for me.
Why'd you hang up on her?

980
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,255
Save you the trouble.

981
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:09,916
If she calls me on the phone...

982
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:12,927
you don't have to tell her I ain't here.
I can do that myself.

983
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:16,328
How can you, yourself,
tell her you're not here? Talk sense.

984
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:20,099
Maybe it don't make sense, but...

985
01:07:20,169 --> 01:07:23,161
- well, you dang well know what I mean.
- Listen, Jimmy...

986
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:25,173
if you want to get yourself in hot water...

987
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:28,210
all you have to do is lift that phone
and call her right back.

988
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:31,644
That's right, Jimmy.
That's all you have to do.

989
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:35,544
- Stay out of this.
- I'm just agreeing with you, Noah.

990
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:37,745
You can call her right back, Jimmy.

991
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:40,686
Go on, kid, go on.

992
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:45,150
- I don't have her telephone number.
- Call the operator.

993
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:50,432
- Starbuck, let me alone.
- Lizzie, tell him to make that call.

994
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:56,631
Starbuck, we'd all thank you
not to interfere in our family.

995
01:08:15,324 --> 01:08:18,816
- What's this thing doing here?
- For Starbuck.

996
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:22,557
Jimmy was gonna take them out
to the tack room, if it's all right.

997
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:25,156
Yes, it's all right. Go on, Jimmy.

998
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:29,904
I don't want to now.

999
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,715
You shouldn't have...

1000
01:08:45,254 --> 01:08:48,052
- done that to him, Noah.
- Somebody's got to do it.

1001
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:53,024
- I think you liked doing it.
- No, I didn't!

1002
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:56,990
For Pete's sake,
somebody take this family off my hands.

1003
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:58,158
I don't want to run it.

1004
01:08:58,234 --> 01:09:00,532
You don't have to run the family,
only the ranch.

1005
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:03,834
- They're both tied up together.
- There's a difference, Noah.

1006
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:07,305
You let them live,
people pay off better than cattle.

1007
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:10,409
Don't be so proud of the way
you let us live, Pop.

1008
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:13,674
Just look at her
and don't be so darn proud of yourself!

1009
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,390
What does he mean, Lizzie?

1010
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:32,261
I don't know.

1011
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:35,593
Don't pay any attention to him, Pop.

1012
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:40,436
Noah's hinting that I made
some big mistake with you, Lizzie.

1013
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:42,871
Did I?

1014
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:49,675
Of course not.

1015
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:54,288
I'm perfect. Everybody knows I'm perfect.

1016
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:58,093
A very nice girl.
Good housekeeper, bright mind...

1017
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,684
very honest.

1018
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:02,856
So darned honest, it kills me.

1019
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:08,434
"You got to get a man like a man gets got."

1020
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:11,001
That's what Noah said.
Now, isn't that stupid?

1021
01:10:11,073 --> 01:10:13,541
It's not even good English.

1022
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:16,703
- Don't think about that, Lizzie?
- Think about it?

1023
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:19,179
Why, I wouldn't give it another thought.

1024
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:26,683
You know what that Starbuck man
said to me?

1025
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:28,350
What, Lizzie?

1026
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:35,088
Why repeat it? A man like that.

1027
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:39,000
You go repeating what people like that
have to say...

1028
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:47,702
Can a woman take lessons
in being a woman?

1029
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:51,578
You don't have to take lessons. You are one.

1030
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:55,615
Starbuck says I'm not.

1031
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:59,686
If Starbuck don't see the woman in you,
he's blind.

1032
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,160
Is File blind?

1033
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:11,561
Are they all blind?

1034
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:18,899
I'm sick and tired of me.

1035
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:24,069
I want to get out of me for a while,
be somebody else.

1036
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:26,773
Go down to the social club
and be Lilly Ann Beasley...

1037
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:28,111
is that what you want to be?

1038
01:11:28,183 --> 01:11:30,913
Lilly Ann Beasley knows how to get along.

1039
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:34,914
You better call her on the telephone,
ask her to let you join up.

1040
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:37,982
I will. You'll see if I don't.

1041
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:42,695
And I'm gonna get myself
a lot of new dresses...

1042
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:45,097
cut way down to here.

1043
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:48,933
And I'll paint my mouth
so it looks like I'm always whistling.

1044
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:51,734
Fine, go ahead.
Look like a silly little jackass.

1045
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:55,140
Won't be me looking silly,
it'll be somebody else.

1046
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:57,576
You've got to hide what you are.

1047
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,375
You can't be honest.

1048
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:01,973
You wouldn't know how to be anything else.

1049
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:03,944
Wouldn't I?

1050
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:09,853
You think it's hard. It's easy.

1051
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:15,428
Phil Mackey.

1052
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:18,330
How good-looking you are.

1053
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:23,196
That curly blond hair, the pearly white teeth.

1054
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:26,963
Can I count your teeth?
One, two, three, four.

1055
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:30,336
Oh, no, don't tickle...

1056
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:34,610
or little Liz is gonna roll right over
and...

1057
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:46,221
- Good evening.
- Hello, File.

1058
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:48,085
Come in.

1059
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:51,927
Kind of late.

1060
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,900
- Hope I'm not disturbing you.
- Oh, no.

1061
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:58,538
That's all right. We were just...

1062
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:02,866
I don't know what we were doing.
But come on in.

1063
01:13:03,278 --> 01:13:04,540
Hello, Lizzie.

1064
01:13:06,749 --> 01:13:09,843
- Hello, File.
- No let up on the drought, is there?

1065
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:14,446
Just none at all. Excuse me, Pop.

1066
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:17,782
I got to thinking about that little fuss...

1067
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:20,795
I had with Jim, about his eye...

1068
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:25,795
- and I wanted to apologize. I'm sorry.
- You said that this afternoon, File.

1069
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:30,162
- I didn't say it to Jim.
- That's right, you didn't.

1070
01:13:31,273 --> 01:13:34,538
- He's upstairs. I'll send him right down.
- Oh, Jim!

1071
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:37,144
- Jimmy, can you come down...
- That's all right, Lizzie.

1072
01:13:37,212 --> 01:13:38,907
I was going up anyway.

1073
01:13:53,028 --> 01:13:54,256
Would you...

1074
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:59,423
- Do you care for a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you. I already had my supper.

1075
01:14:00,402 --> 01:14:03,166
- Yes. Yes, of course.
- I didn't mean to mention supper.

1076
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:05,069
I just... You know.

1077
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:09,167
- How about some nice cold lemonade?
- No, thank you.

1078
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:17,117
I make lemonade with limes.

1079
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,983
I guess if you make it with limes,
you can't...

1080
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:25,283
- call it lemonade, can you?
- You can if you want to.

1081
01:14:25,994 --> 01:14:29,521
But it's really limeade, isn't it?

1082
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:32,795
Yeah, that's what it is. Limeade.

1083
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:36,634
- That's what it is, all right.
- You call me, Lizzie?

1084
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:41,701
- Hey, File.
- Hi, Jim.

1085
01:14:42,344 --> 01:14:46,110
My, that's a bad eye.
I came around to tell you I'm sorry.

1086
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:49,514
Don't think nothing of it, File.
Bygones is bygones.

1087
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:51,576
Glad to hear you talk that way.

1088
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:56,855
File's here, huh?

1089
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:01,219
Yes, sir, he sure is.

1090
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:08,600
Wouldn't you like to sit down or something?

1091
01:15:09,538 --> 01:15:10,800
No, thank you.

1092
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:14,974
Guess they both knew I was lying.

1093
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:17,906
Lying? About what?

1094
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:22,177
I didn't come here to apologize to Jim.

1095
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:25,447
What did you come for, File?

1096
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:30,889
To get something off my chest.
This afternoon, your father...

1097
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:37,825
Well, there's a wrong impression going
around town that I'm a widower...

1098
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:40,425
- but I'm not.
- I know that, File.

1099
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:42,868
I know you know it, but I've got to say it.

1100
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:46,499
I'm a divorced man.
I've been denying it. Now I admit it.

1101
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:50,539
That's all I want to say.

1102
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:54,373
- That squares me with everybody.
- Does it?

1103
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:56,542
Yes, it does. From here on in...

1104
01:15:56,618 --> 01:16:00,384
if I want to live alone all by myself,
it's nobody's business but my own.

1105
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:03,683
Wait a minute. You're dead wrong.

1106
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:05,124
Wrong? How?

1107
01:16:05,193 --> 01:16:08,959
- Well, it's everybody's business.
- How do you figure that, Lizzie?

1108
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:12,962
Because you owe something to people.

1109
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:16,967
- I don't owe anything to anybody.
- Yes, you do.

1110
01:16:17,673 --> 01:16:19,607
- What?
- I don't know.

1111
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:21,503
Friendship.

1112
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:24,307
If somebody holds out his hand
toward you...

1113
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:29,377
- you've got to reach and take it.
- What do you mean, I've got to?

1114
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:30,440
Got to.

1115
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:33,914
There are too many people alone...

1116
01:16:34,222 --> 01:16:37,248
and if you're lucky enough
for somebody to want you...

1117
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:40,921
for a friend...

1118
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:43,491
it's an obligation.

1119
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:45,923
This isn't something...

1120
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:49,493
the two of us can settle
by just talking for a minute.

1121
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:52,234
No, it isn't.

1122
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:56,340
It'll take some time.

1123
01:16:59,147 --> 01:17:00,136
Yes.

1124
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:14,858
- You here, File?
- I guess I'm here.

1125
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:18,066
I'm just going up to get my feed book.

1126
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:23,861
- What were you saying?
- What were you saying?

1127
01:17:26,008 --> 01:17:29,375
You were telling me about your divorce.

1128
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:32,242
No, I wasn't. But I will.

1129
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:36,073
- She walked out on me.
- She did?

1130
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:38,717
For the schoolteacher.
He was from Louisville.

1131
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:39,776
Kentucky?

1132
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:41,884
Was she...

1133
01:17:41,957 --> 01:17:44,118
- I guess she was beautiful.
- Yes, she was.

1134
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:46,626
That's what was afraid...
That's what I thought.

1135
01:17:46,695 --> 01:17:47,821
Black hair.

1136
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:50,755
Black hair is pretty, all right.

1137
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:55,162
The schoolteacher, darn it.
Ran off with a schoolteacher.

1138
01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:57,094
What was he like?

1139
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:59,834
He had weak hands and nearsighted eyes.

1140
01:17:59,908 --> 01:18:02,206
He always looked like
he was about ready to faint.

1141
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:05,303
She ran off with him. And there I was.

1142
01:18:09,651 --> 01:18:13,553
Maybe the teacher needed her
and you didn't.

1143
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:15,681
- Sure, I needed her.
- Did you tell her so?

1144
01:18:15,757 --> 01:18:19,124
- No, I didn't. Why should I?
- Why should you? Why didn't you?

1145
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:20,354
I won't ask for anything.

1146
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:22,488
But if you'd asked her,
she might have stayed.

1147
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:23,895
I know darn well she might have.

1148
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:27,093
The night she left, she said:
"Tell me not to go, tell me don't go."

1149
01:18:27,169 --> 01:18:29,694
- And you didn't?
- I tried, but I couldn't.

1150
01:18:30,272 --> 01:18:33,070
- Pride.
- Lf a woman wants to go, let her go.

1151
01:18:33,141 --> 01:18:35,769
If you've got to hold her back, it's no good.

1152
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,481
- Lf you had to do it again.
- I still wouldn't ask her to stay.

1153
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:45,446
Just two words, "don't go,"
and you wouldn't say them?

1154
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,045
It's not the words, it's begging.
And I won't beg.

1155
01:18:48,123 --> 01:18:50,057
You're a fool!

1156
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:53,956
Whatever am I doing...

1157
01:18:54,596 --> 01:18:57,087
getting so serious with you, File?

1158
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:00,860
Because I should have known better...

1159
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:03,996
because whenever I do, I put my foot in it.

1160
01:19:05,974 --> 01:19:09,774
Because being serious, that's not my nature.

1161
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:13,406
I'm really a happy-go-lucky girl,
just like any other girl.

1162
01:19:13,482 --> 01:19:16,007
- Would you like some grapes?
- No.

1163
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:19,176
- Thank you.
- They're very good.

1164
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:22,486
And so purpley and pretty.

1165
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:27,091
We had some right after supper.

1166
01:19:29,397 --> 01:19:32,423
I wish you'd been here to supper.

1167
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:35,860
I made such a nice supper.

1168
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:40,837
I like to cook.

1169
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:49,149
There's only one thing I like better
than cooking...

1170
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:52,414
and that's reading a book.
Do you read very much?

1171
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:56,284
Only the legal circulars
that come from Washington.

1172
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:58,826
Washington, what a great man.

1173
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:01,624
Don't you think
that Washington was a great man?

1174
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:04,298
- Father of our country.
- Yes.

1175
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:07,563
And when you think of all he went through,
all that suffering...

1176
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:11,003
when you think of it, Valley Forge,
all those bleeding feet.

1177
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:15,068
I don't think about it much.

1178
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:18,802
No...

1179
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:21,043
of course not.

1180
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:26,579
My, what a nice tie.

1181
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:29,886
I just die for men in black silk bow ties.

1182
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:32,289
- It's silk leather.
- No.

1183
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:35,329
I wouldn't have believed it. It looks so real.

1184
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:37,558
- It looks so real.
- Real's fake.

1185
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:40,931
And when you smile,
you've got the strongest, whitest teeth.

1186
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:42,526
- Now, quit that.
- What?

1187
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:46,438
Now, quit it. Stop sashaying around
like a dumb little flirt.

1188
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:49,375
- Black silk tie, strong white teeth.
- Oh, no.

1189
01:20:49,444 --> 01:20:51,969
What do you take me for?
What do you take yourself for?

1190
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:54,015
- I was trying to...
- Don't be so ridiculous.

1191
01:20:54,082 --> 01:20:55,481
Be yourself.

1192
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:59,110
I was only trying to...

1193
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:03,857
- Holy smokes.
- What's happened, Lizzie?

1194
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:05,916
- Holy smokes.
- Never seen a man run so fast.

1195
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:08,588
- Where's he going?
- What'd he do, run out on you?

1196
01:21:08,663 --> 01:21:10,130
Were you watching the show?

1197
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:12,666
- Did you think it was lantern slides?
- What'd he say?

1198
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:15,430
- What'd you say?
- Not one sensible thing.

1199
01:21:15,503 --> 01:21:18,301
- I couldn't even speak to him.
- But you were talking.

1200
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:21,206
No, I was sashaying around
like Lilly Ann Beasley.

1201
01:21:21,276 --> 01:21:25,110
- I was making a fool of myself.
- Now, don't blame yourself, Lizzie.

1202
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:27,341
- It wasn't your fault.
- No, it wasn't her fault.

1203
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:30,942
And it wasn't File's fault.
You darn well know whose fault it was.

1204
01:21:31,019 --> 01:21:32,919
- You mean it was mine, Noah?
- Yes.

1205
01:21:32,988 --> 01:21:35,923
She's got to face facts!
And you've got to help her face them.

1206
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:38,721
- Stop telling her lies.
- I never told her a lie in my life.

1207
01:21:38,793 --> 01:21:42,229
You've told her nothing but lies.
She's the smartest girl in the world...

1208
01:21:42,297 --> 01:21:44,561
she's beautiful,
and that's the worst lie of all.

1209
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:46,760
You know she's not beautiful, she's plain!

1210
01:21:46,835 --> 01:21:49,326
- You quit that, Noah!
- And you go right along with him.

1211
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:52,305
I'm the only one that loves you enough
to tell the truth.

1212
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:53,966
- You're plain!
- Noah, you quit it.

1213
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:56,738
Go look at yourself in the mirror.
You're plain!

1214
01:22:00,815 --> 01:22:02,544
Stop that.

1215
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:09,287
- Starbuck, let me go!
- Wait outside, Jimmy.

1216
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:11,723
- Let me go.
- Get outside!

1217
01:22:12,794 --> 01:22:16,560
Sure, I'll get out.
I'll get out and never come back!

1218
01:22:22,871 --> 01:22:24,566
Next time that kid goes at me, I'll...

1219
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:26,800
Next time,
I'll see that he has fighting lessons.

1220
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:28,604
- Clear out of here!
- I won't clear out!

1221
01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:30,804
And you're gonna quit calling him
a dumbbell...

1222
01:22:30,879 --> 01:22:32,073
because he's not.

1223
01:22:32,147 --> 01:22:34,615
He can take a little hickory stick
and see magic in it.

1224
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:36,844
You wouldn't understand.
It's not in your books.

1225
01:22:36,918 --> 01:22:40,183
- I said, clear out!
- And don't you ever call her plain.

1226
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:43,088
Because you don't know
what's plain and what's beautiful.

1227
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:44,989
Starbuck, this is family.

1228
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,994
- It's not your fight!
- Yes, it is.

1229
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:50,691
I've been fighting fellows like you all my life.
And I always lose.

1230
01:22:50,765 --> 01:22:53,757
But this time, I swear, this time...

1231
01:23:08,783 --> 01:23:11,411
I'm sorry I hit Jim. And I'll tell him so.

1232
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:14,854
I ain't sorry for a single word
that I said to her.

1233
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:18,254
- That's enough.
- No, it ain't enough!

1234
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:26,594
You better think about what I said.

1235
01:23:27,535 --> 01:23:30,504
Nobody is gonna come
riding up here on a white horse.

1236
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:34,499
Nobody's gonna snatch you up
in his arms and marry you.

1237
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:36,870
You're gonna be an old maid.

1238
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:40,309
The sooner you face it...

1239
01:23:40,882 --> 01:23:43,817
the sooner you'll stop breaking your heart.

1240
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:18,979
Old maid.

1241
01:24:19,954 --> 01:24:21,353
Forget it, Lizzie.

1242
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:23,585
Forget everything he said.

1243
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:27,257
No. He's right, Pop.

1244
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:32,356
I've known it a long time.

1245
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:37,561
But it wasn't so bad
until he put a name to it.

1246
01:24:40,775 --> 01:24:42,436
Old maid.

1247
01:24:43,812 --> 01:24:46,645
Why is it so much worse
when you put a name to it?

1248
01:24:47,949 --> 01:24:51,407
- You've got to believe me.
- I don't believe you, Pop.

1249
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,914
You've been lying to me...

1250
01:24:54,989 --> 01:24:56,684
and I've been lying to myself.

1251
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:59,249
- Lizzie, honey, please.
- Don't, Pop, don't.

1252
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:04,655
I've got to see things the way they are,
and the way they will be.

1253
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:09,066
I've got to start thinking of myself...

1254
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:12,803
as I am. Old maid.

1255
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:17,139
Jim will get married...

1256
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:21,044
and one of these days,
even Noah will get married.

1257
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:23,641
I'll be the visiting aunt.

1258
01:25:24,486 --> 01:25:28,252
I'll bring presents to their children
to be sure I'm welcome...

1259
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:30,357
and Noah will say:

1260
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:34,827
"Junior, be kind to your Aunt Lizzie.
Her nerves aren't so good."

1261
01:25:35,196 --> 01:25:38,893
And Jim's wife will say,
"She's been visiting here a whole week.

1262
01:25:39,234 --> 01:25:40,861
"When'll she ever go?"

1263
01:25:41,936 --> 01:25:44,700
Go where?

1264
01:25:47,075 --> 01:25:50,203
Lizzie, you'll always have a home.

1265
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:55,179
- This house will be yours.
- House.

1266
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:57,474
Oh, Lizzie, stop it.

1267
01:25:57,919 --> 01:26:00,820
My skin's hot all over.

1268
01:26:01,122 --> 01:26:05,786
And when I touch it, it's cold.
I'm all tied up.

1269
01:26:06,394 --> 01:26:11,229
My clothes are tying me up.
I can't move in my clothes.

1270
01:26:11,299 --> 01:26:14,598
- Lizzie.
- Pop, help me!

1271
01:26:14,936 --> 01:26:19,236
Tell me what to do. Help me!

1272
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:54,603
- Who is it?
- Just me, Lizzie.

1273
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:02,138
Jimmy meant to give you this. Here.

1274
01:27:03,017 --> 01:27:04,917
- Well, what is it?
- Bed stuff.

1275
01:27:06,454 --> 01:27:08,251
Jimmy meant to give it.

1276
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:11,385
- Take it.
- Thanks.

1277
01:27:13,328 --> 01:27:15,728
- Is that what you came out for?
- No.

1278
01:27:15,797 --> 01:27:17,765
I came out...

1279
01:27:18,499 --> 01:27:20,592
Go on, Lizzie.

1280
01:27:21,536 --> 01:27:23,731
I came out...

1281
01:27:23,805 --> 01:27:27,070
to thank you for what you said to Noah.

1282
01:27:27,842 --> 01:27:29,104
I meant every word of it.

1283
01:27:29,177 --> 01:27:31,771
What you said about Jimmy,
I know you meant that.

1284
01:27:31,846 --> 01:27:35,782
- What I said about you.
- I don't believe you.

1285
01:27:36,451 --> 01:27:38,419
Then what are you thanking me for?

1286
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:42,354
You scared if you stopped being
sore at me, you might like me a little?

1287
01:27:43,758 --> 01:27:47,660
Then stay and talk with me.
It's lonely out here.

1288
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:55,398
What are you afraid of?

1289
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:58,166
You. I don't trust you.

1290
01:27:58,773 --> 01:27:59,967
Why?

1291
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:03,133
- What don't you trust about me?
- Everything.

1292
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:07,544
The way you talk, the way you brag,
even your name.

1293
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:12,484
- What's wrong with my name?
- Sounds fake.

1294
01:28:12,887 --> 01:28:16,823
- Sounds like you made it up.
- You're darn right. I did make it up.

1295
01:28:16,891 --> 01:28:19,018
- There, of course.
- Why not?

1296
01:28:19,594 --> 01:28:22,290
Do you know what name I was born with?
Smith.

1297
01:28:22,530 --> 01:28:24,760
Smith, for the love of Mike. Smith.

1298
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:27,562
Now, what kind of a name is that
for a fellow like me?

1299
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:31,002
I need a name with the whole sky in it
and the power of a man.

1300
01:28:31,272 --> 01:28:33,365
Starbuck.

1301
01:28:33,841 --> 01:28:36,674
- Now, there's a name and it's mine.
- No, it's not.

1302
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:39,678
You were born Smith and that's your name.

1303
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:43,139
You're wrong, Lizzie.

1304
01:28:43,217 --> 01:28:44,775
The name you choose for yourself...

1305
01:28:44,852 --> 01:28:47,480
is more your own
than the name you were born with.

1306
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:51,822
And if I was you,
I'd sure choose another name than Lizzie.

1307
01:28:52,794 --> 01:28:56,890
- Thank you. I'm very pleased with it.
- No, you ain't.

1308
01:28:57,298 --> 01:28:59,357
You ain't pleased
with anything about yourself.

1309
01:28:59,434 --> 01:29:01,163
And you sure ain't pleased with Lizzie.

1310
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:04,204
- Why, it don't stand for anything.
- It stands for me.

1311
01:29:04,539 --> 01:29:07,770
I'm not Lady Godiva,
I'm not the Queen of Sheba...

1312
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:10,934
I'm not Cinderella at the ball.

1313
01:29:14,315 --> 01:29:15,942
Would you like to be?

1314
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:19,748
- Starbuck, you're ridiculous.
- What's ridiculous about it?

1315
01:29:20,388 --> 01:29:22,879
Dream you're somebody. Be somebody.

1316
01:29:23,758 --> 01:29:25,692
But Lizzie, that's nobody.

1317
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:30,390
There are so many millions
of wonderful women with wonderful names.

1318
01:29:30,631 --> 01:29:33,099
Leonora, Desdemona...

1319
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:36,796
Annabella, Pauline, Florinda...

1320
01:29:37,171 --> 01:29:41,164
Christina, Cordelia, Diane.

1321
01:29:43,511 --> 01:29:44,705
Lizzie.

1322
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:49,439
Goodnight, Starbuck.

1323
01:29:51,753 --> 01:29:53,050
Just a minute, Lizzie.

1324
01:29:53,121 --> 01:29:56,147
I got the greatest name for you.
The greatest name.

1325
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:01,585
Now, you just listen.

1326
01:30:02,463 --> 01:30:05,591
- Melisande.
- I don't like it.

1327
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:08,066
But that's because you don't know
anything about her.

1328
01:30:08,136 --> 01:30:11,572
Lady, when I tell you who she was.

1329
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:14,039
- Who?
- Why, she was the most beautiful...

1330
01:30:15,276 --> 01:30:18,712
she was the beautiful wife of King Hamlet.

1331
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:22,205
- You ever hear of him?
- Go on, Starbuck.

1332
01:30:23,451 --> 01:30:25,817
He was the fellow who sailed
across the ocean...

1333
01:30:25,887 --> 01:30:29,220
and brought back the Golden Fleece.
And do you know why he did that?

1334
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:32,088
Because Queen Melisande,
she begged him for it.

1335
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:34,060
I tell you, that Melisande...

1336
01:30:34,796 --> 01:30:37,731
what a queen. That Melisande...

1337
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:41,727
she was so beautiful,
and her hair was so long and curly...

1338
01:30:42,203 --> 01:30:44,433
why, every time he looked at her...

1339
01:30:44,505 --> 01:30:47,030
he just fell right down and died.

1340
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:50,202
And King Hamlet, he'd do anything for her,
anything she wanted.

1341
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:51,677
So when she said:

1342
01:30:51,746 --> 01:30:56,115
"Hamlet, I've got a terrible hankering
for a soft Golden Fleece."

1343
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:59,648
Why, he just naturally sailed right off
to find it.

1344
01:31:27,748 --> 01:31:29,443
And when he came back...

1345
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:31,641
torn and bleeding...

1346
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:36,146
he took that fleece of gold
and he laid it at her pretty white feet.

1347
01:31:36,624 --> 01:31:40,151
And she picked up that fur piece,
and she wrapped it around...

1348
01:31:40,228 --> 01:31:44,255
her pink naked shoulders and she said:

1349
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:48,769
"I've got the Golden Fleece
and I'll never be cold no more."

1350
01:32:00,548 --> 01:32:04,917
Melisande, what a woman. What a name.

1351
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:12,724
Starbuck, you silly jackass.

1352
01:32:13,928 --> 01:32:18,388
You take a lot of stories that I've read
in a hundred different places...

1353
01:32:18,466 --> 01:32:22,698
and you roll them up
into one big, fat ridiculous lie.

1354
01:32:23,004 --> 01:32:27,441
- I wasn't lying. I was dreaming.
- It's the same thing.

1355
01:32:31,145 --> 01:32:34,945
If you think it's the same thing,
then I take it back about your name.

1356
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:37,877
Lizzie, that's just right for you.

1357
01:32:38,286 --> 01:32:41,119
I'll tell you another name
that would suit you. Noah.

1358
01:32:41,188 --> 01:32:44,021
Because you and your brother,
you've got no dream.

1359
01:33:03,711 --> 01:33:07,306
You think all dreams have to be your kind.

1360
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:11,710
Golden Fleece and thunder on the mountain.

1361
01:33:12,386 --> 01:33:14,650
But there are other dreams, Starbuck.

1362
01:33:15,056 --> 01:33:18,389
Little quiet ones
that come to a woman when...

1363
01:33:18,659 --> 01:33:21,992
she's shining the silverware
and putting moth flakes in the closet.

1364
01:33:22,997 --> 01:33:24,089
Like what?

1365
01:33:24,932 --> 01:33:26,729
Like a man's voice saying:

1366
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:30,829
"Lizzie, is my blue suit pressed?"

1367
01:33:31,305 --> 01:33:35,207
And the same man saying,
"Scratch between my shoulder blades."

1368
01:33:36,711 --> 01:33:40,238
And kids laughing and teasing
and setting up a racket.

1369
01:33:40,581 --> 01:33:44,449
And how it feels to say the word "husband."

1370
01:33:45,486 --> 01:33:48,649
There are all kinds of dreams, Mr. Starbuck.

1371
01:33:49,156 --> 01:33:52,421
Mine are small ones like my name, Lizzie.

1372
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:56,120
But they're real, like my name.

1373
01:33:56,731 --> 01:33:57,720
Real.

1374
01:33:57,932 --> 01:34:01,163
So if you can have yours,
then I'll have mine.

1375
01:34:01,335 --> 01:34:02,768
- Lizzie.
- Please.

1376
01:34:02,837 --> 01:34:04,668
- Stop crying.
- I can't.

1377
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:07,902
- I'm sorry, Lizzie. I'm sorry.
- It's all right. Let me go.

1378
01:34:07,975 --> 01:34:09,909
I hope your dreams come true.
I hope they do.

1379
01:34:09,977 --> 01:34:12,445
They won't. They never will.

1380
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:17,016
- Believe in yourself and they will.
- I got nothing to believe in.

1381
01:34:17,385 --> 01:34:21,515
- You're a woman, believe in that.
- How can I when nobody else will?

1382
01:34:22,223 --> 01:34:24,418
You've got to believe it first.

1383
01:34:24,792 --> 01:34:27,352
Lizzie, let me ask you, are you pretty?

1384
01:34:27,962 --> 01:34:31,557
No! I'm plain.

1385
01:34:33,367 --> 01:34:37,030
There's no such thing as a plain woman.
Every real woman is pretty.

1386
01:34:37,104 --> 01:34:39,698
They're pretty in a different way,
but they're all pretty.

1387
01:34:39,774 --> 01:34:43,039
Not me. When I look in my looking glass...

1388
01:34:43,310 --> 01:34:46,108
- Don't let Noah be your looking glass.
- He's not.

1389
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:48,805
My looking glass is right on the wall.

1390
01:34:48,883 --> 01:34:51,750
It's in the wrong place.
It's got to be inside you.

1391
01:34:51,852 --> 01:34:54,286
- No.
- Don't be afraid. Look.

1392
01:34:54,522 --> 01:34:57,389
Then one day, the looking glass
will be the man who loves you.

1393
01:34:57,458 --> 01:34:58,925
It'll be his eyes, maybe.

1394
01:34:58,993 --> 01:35:02,053
And you'll look in that mirror,
and you'll be more than pretty.

1395
01:35:02,129 --> 01:35:05,929
- You'll be beautiful.
- It'll never happen. It'll never be.

1396
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,231
Make it happen.
Lizzie, why don't you think pretty?

1397
01:35:09,637 --> 01:35:12,162
- And take down your hair.
- No.

1398
01:35:13,007 --> 01:35:14,770
- Please.
- No.

1399
01:35:14,842 --> 01:35:17,276
Nobody sees you. Nobody but me, Lizzie.

1400
01:35:25,286 --> 01:35:28,687
Now, close your eyes. Close them.

1401
01:35:30,991 --> 01:35:32,083
Now say:

1402
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:34,288
"I'm pretty."

1403
01:35:40,034 --> 01:35:43,367
- I can't.
- Say it, Lizzie. Say it.

1404
01:35:44,638 --> 01:35:46,333
- I'm pretty.
- Say it again.

1405
01:35:46,874 --> 01:35:48,842
- Pretty.
- Say it, mean it.

1406
01:35:50,444 --> 01:35:52,378
I'm pretty.

1407
01:36:12,099 --> 01:36:13,862
Why did you do that?

1408
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:21,339
Because when you said you were pretty...

1409
01:36:21,542 --> 01:36:22,736
it was true.

1410
01:36:25,846 --> 01:36:28,508
Lizzie, look at me.

1411
01:36:29,483 --> 01:36:31,974
- I can't.
- Stop crying and look at me.

1412
01:36:33,587 --> 01:36:34,918
Look at my eyes.

1413
01:36:36,524 --> 01:36:37,889
What do you see?

1414
01:36:41,262 --> 01:36:42,456
I can't...

1415
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:45,925
- believe what I see.
- Tell me what you see.

1416
01:36:48,869 --> 01:36:50,268
Is it me?

1417
01:36:51,272 --> 01:36:53,365
Is it really me?

1418
01:37:45,526 --> 01:37:48,017
Thank you, Howard.
I'm sorry I woke you up.

1419
01:37:49,163 --> 01:37:51,859
If you hear from Jimmy,
you call me right away.

1420
01:37:52,766 --> 01:37:56,793
No, nothing's wrong. Thanks, Howard.

1421
01:38:05,212 --> 01:38:08,147
- Jimmy get home yet?
- Nope.

1422
01:38:11,785 --> 01:38:12,877
Goofy kid.

1423
01:38:13,921 --> 01:38:15,445
After midnight.

1424
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:19,352
Go back to sleep, Noah.

1425
01:38:19,526 --> 01:38:22,393
- Don't worry about him.
- I ain't worried about him.

1426
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:27,500
- I don't give a darn what happens to him.
- Okay, fine.

1427
01:38:30,905 --> 01:38:33,806
If you'd have seen my side of this,
it wouldn't have happened.

1428
01:38:33,874 --> 01:38:37,139
I see your side, Noah.
I just ain't on your side.

1429
01:38:50,824 --> 01:38:53,691
- Good evening.
- Where the devil you been?

1430
01:38:54,328 --> 01:38:55,352
Out.

1431
01:39:00,134 --> 01:39:03,797
- What's wrong with you? You drunk?
- No, big brother, I ain't drunk.

1432
01:39:04,071 --> 01:39:05,971
But if I cared to be drunk...

1433
01:39:06,073 --> 01:39:10,407
- I'd be google-eyed.
- Jimmy, where did you get that stogie?

1434
01:39:10,611 --> 01:39:13,444
This ain't no stogie, Pop.
It's a Havana panatela.

1435
01:39:13,681 --> 01:39:17,777
- 85 cents. And it's a present.
- Who the sam hill gave it to you?

1436
01:39:18,252 --> 01:39:21,346
I the sam hill gave it to me
for being a big boy.

1437
01:39:22,022 --> 01:39:25,321
- You didn't say where you've been.
- No, and I don't have to.

1438
01:39:26,627 --> 01:39:27,719
But I will.

1439
01:39:29,797 --> 01:39:32,823
I've been out with my favorite gal, Snookie.

1440
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:37,400
- You crazy, dumb little...
- Don't say dumb no more, Noah.

1441
01:39:37,471 --> 01:39:41,373
Or I shall take this 85-cent Havana panatela,
and I shall squash it...

1442
01:39:41,442 --> 01:39:44,138
- right in your mean old face.
- What happened, Jimmy?

1443
01:39:44,211 --> 01:39:46,042
Can't you see what happened?

1444
01:39:46,113 --> 01:39:48,047
He went riding with that Snookie Maguire...

1445
01:39:48,115 --> 01:39:50,379
she got him all het up, and she trapped him.

1446
01:39:50,451 --> 01:39:53,682
- Big brother, you got it all wrong.
- Don't lie to me, Jimmy Curry.

1447
01:39:53,754 --> 01:39:56,985
The minute I stop looking after you,
you got yourself into trouble.

1448
01:39:57,057 --> 01:40:00,788
When I tell you what really happened,
you're gonna split your britches.

1449
01:40:00,861 --> 01:40:02,158
We went riding.

1450
01:40:03,464 --> 01:40:04,556
That's right.

1451
01:40:04,631 --> 01:40:07,964
We opened that old roadster up
and we went 40 million miles an hour.

1452
01:40:08,035 --> 01:40:11,402
And then we stopped that car
and we got out...

1453
01:40:11,939 --> 01:40:14,305
and we sat down under a great, big tree.

1454
01:40:14,808 --> 01:40:16,969
And we could look up through
the branches...

1455
01:40:17,044 --> 01:40:19,171
and see the sky all full of stars.

1456
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:22,813
And I turned around and I kissed her.

1457
01:40:23,650 --> 01:40:26,380
I kissed her once,
I kissed her a hundred times.

1458
01:40:26,954 --> 01:40:30,117
And while I was doing that,
I knew I could carry her anywhere...

1459
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:31,987
right straight to the moon.

1460
01:40:32,626 --> 01:40:34,389
And all the time, I kept thinking:

1461
01:40:34,461 --> 01:40:37,726
"Noah's gonna come along
and he's gonna say, 'Whoa."'

1462
01:40:38,532 --> 01:40:42,298
But Noah didn't show up,
so I kept right on kissing.

1463
01:40:43,237 --> 01:40:45,865
And then something happened.

1464
01:40:46,607 --> 01:40:49,906
She was crying and I was crying...

1465
01:40:51,011 --> 01:40:54,879
and I thought any minute now
we're gonna be right up there on the moon.

1466
01:40:55,015 --> 01:40:56,141
And then...

1467
01:40:57,885 --> 01:41:00,012
without Noah being there...

1468
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:02,947
all by my smart little self...

1469
01:41:04,158 --> 01:41:05,989
I said, "Whoa!"

1470
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:08,585
- Yippee!
- Thank you, Pop.

1471
01:41:08,662 --> 01:41:11,756
- Your yippee is accepted.
- I don't believe a word of it.

1472
01:41:11,832 --> 01:41:13,424
Why did she give you the hat?

1473
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:16,128
For the same reason
I gave her my elk's tooth.

1474
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:19,837
- We're engaged.
- So I was right.

1475
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:22,705
- She did trap you.
- Don't listen to him, Jimmy.

1476
01:41:24,111 --> 01:41:26,272
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Pop.

1477
01:41:26,713 --> 01:41:28,305
Thank you very kindly.

1478
01:41:29,450 --> 01:41:31,315
I got to tell Lizzie. Where's Lizzie?

1479
01:41:31,385 --> 01:41:34,081
Where the blaze you think she is?
She's asleep.

1480
01:41:34,254 --> 01:41:36,245
- I'll wake her up.
- Wait, Jimmy.

1481
01:41:36,690 --> 01:41:39,022
- Lizzie's not up there.
- Where is she?

1482
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:43,291
- Yeah, where is she, Pop?
- She's out in the tack room.

1483
01:41:44,798 --> 01:41:46,732
- You mean with Starbuck?
- Yup.

1484
01:41:47,701 --> 01:41:51,637
Well, boy, that's great!
I got another cigar for Lizzie.

1485
01:41:52,206 --> 01:41:53,468
Wait a minute.

1486
01:41:54,708 --> 01:41:57,768
You mean you let her walk in on that fellow
when he's sleeping?

1487
01:41:57,845 --> 01:42:00,780
- You didn't even try to stop her?
- No, I didn't.

1488
01:42:01,482 --> 01:42:03,006
You called her an old maid.

1489
01:42:03,083 --> 01:42:05,745
You took away the last little bit of hope
she ever had.

1490
01:42:05,819 --> 01:42:08,481
And when you left,
she took those bed covers and ran out.

1491
01:42:08,555 --> 01:42:11,456
I didn't ask her where she was going,
but I'm glad she went.

1492
01:42:11,525 --> 01:42:14,722
'Cause if she lost her hope in here,
maybe she'll find it out there.

1493
01:42:14,795 --> 01:42:17,286
Yeah, I think it's great them being
out there together.

1494
01:42:17,364 --> 01:42:19,423
They might get real serious
about each other...

1495
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:22,230
and before you know it,
I got me a new brother.

1496
01:42:22,302 --> 01:42:24,202
And boy, I'd swap him for you any day.

1497
01:42:24,271 --> 01:42:27,172
You won't have to swap him
'cause he ain't the marrying kind.

1498
01:42:27,241 --> 01:42:29,368
- Not that faker.
- I bet he is the marrying kind.

1499
01:42:29,443 --> 01:42:31,138
- I bet he is.
- All right, suppose he is.

1500
01:42:31,211 --> 01:42:33,941
- What do you think a rainmaker makes?
- Rain.

1501
01:42:36,450 --> 01:42:37,974
What's that?

1502
01:42:48,328 --> 01:42:50,159
- Hi, H.C.
- Hiya, File.

1503
01:42:50,230 --> 01:42:52,391
- Hey, File.
- Hi, Jim, Noah.

1504
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,128
Kind of late to be visiting, ain't it, File?

1505
01:42:56,203 --> 01:42:58,899
Ain't exactly visiting.

1506
01:42:59,139 --> 01:43:02,233
- How's Lizzie?
- You come calling on Lizzie?

1507
01:43:02,743 --> 01:43:05,871
- No.
- Then what can I do for you?

1508
01:43:05,946 --> 01:43:10,679
I tell you, we've been getting a lot of calls
from Peak's Junction, all along the state line.

1509
01:43:10,751 --> 01:43:13,549
Seems they're looking for a fellow.

1510
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:17,051
He's kind of a con man,
name of Tornado Johnson.

1511
01:43:18,892 --> 01:43:20,860
- She asleep?
- Who, Lizzie?

1512
01:43:21,495 --> 01:43:23,292
Yeah, I guess she is.

1513
01:43:25,299 --> 01:43:27,460
- You get any wind of him?
- Who?

1514
01:43:27,534 --> 01:43:29,297
- Tornado Johnson.
- No.

1515
01:43:30,837 --> 01:43:32,566
Come here, I'll show you.

1516
01:43:35,742 --> 01:43:37,801
Tornado Johnson...

1517
01:43:38,312 --> 01:43:42,248
alias Bill Harley, alias Bill Smith.
He's wanted in the State of Kansas.

1518
01:43:42,716 --> 01:43:44,946
Drummed up a lot of excitement about...

1519
01:43:45,018 --> 01:43:47,851
what he called
a spectacular eclipse of the sun.

1520
01:43:48,589 --> 01:43:52,252
Peddled about a thousand pairs
of smoked eyeglasses to see it with.

1521
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:54,725
No eclipse.

1522
01:43:55,562 --> 01:43:58,759
About a year ago,
he sold 600 wooden poles...

1523
01:43:58,832 --> 01:44:01,096
said they were good against tornadoes.

1524
01:44:01,168 --> 01:44:03,659
The town he sold them to...

1525
01:44:05,172 --> 01:44:08,232
town got hit by every kind of a blow
you could imagine.

1526
01:44:08,542 --> 01:44:11,978
Hailstorm, rainstorm, windstorm,
a hurricane.

1527
01:44:13,347 --> 01:44:17,113
Moved the tornado poles right of the roof.
Blew the town off the map.

1528
01:44:17,784 --> 01:44:20,651
- Did it ever get hit by a tornado?
- No, it didn't.

1529
01:44:21,355 --> 01:44:24,950
That's all he guaranteed.
That it wouldn't get hit by a tornado...

1530
01:44:25,192 --> 01:44:26,716
- and it didn't.
- Yeah.

1531
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:30,321
Don't sound to me
like he done anything criminal, File.

1532
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:34,833
- Does sound like a con man, don't it?
- Maybe, if you say so.

1533
01:44:35,235 --> 01:44:37,362
But I'm sorry, I can't help you.

1534
01:44:40,607 --> 01:44:42,336
Whose drum is that there?

1535
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:44,642
Mine.

1536
01:44:46,146 --> 01:44:48,046
I'm figuring to be a drummer.

1537
01:44:57,357 --> 01:44:59,825
- Who painted the arrow.
- I did.

1538
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:04,492
- Any particular reason?
- No, just like to paint arrows.

1539
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:08,024
Whose wagon's there?

1540
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:18,471
I'll have a look at that wagon, H.C.

1541
01:45:27,087 --> 01:45:28,679
Noah, where you going?

1542
01:45:30,390 --> 01:45:33,518
- Noah, what are you doing?
- Why'd you do that?

1543
01:45:33,593 --> 01:45:36,790
Why didn't you tell him,
"He's in the tack room with my daughter?"

1544
01:45:36,863 --> 01:45:39,024
- Because he's with my daughter.
- All right.

1545
01:45:39,099 --> 01:45:42,330
I didn't tell on you or lie
and I stood by you, but not anymore.

1546
01:45:42,402 --> 01:45:44,495
I'm going out to the tack room
and bring her in.

1547
01:45:44,571 --> 01:45:46,505
- And I'm gonna bring him in, too!
- No, wait!

1548
01:45:46,573 --> 01:45:47,801
Put that down.

1549
01:45:48,208 --> 01:45:50,369
You want Lizzie out there with him?

1550
01:45:50,444 --> 01:45:53,038
He's a swindler and a crook,
and I don't know what else.

1551
01:45:53,113 --> 01:45:55,445
I'll tell you what else, Noah. He's a man.

1552
01:45:55,515 --> 01:45:57,710
Pop's right.
Getting married is getting married.

1553
01:45:57,784 --> 01:46:00,014
You always say the smart thing
at a dumb time.

1554
01:46:00,087 --> 01:46:03,386
I'm all for her getting married.
I don't care who the fellow is.

1555
01:46:03,457 --> 01:46:05,550
- Is that the way you think?
- You know it's not.

1556
01:46:05,625 --> 01:46:07,422
- Then I'm going.
- Stay here!

1557
01:46:07,561 --> 01:46:09,961
But it ain't right, Pop! It ain't right!

1558
01:46:10,297 --> 01:46:13,824
Noah, you're so full of what's right,
you can't see what's good.

1559
01:46:14,401 --> 01:46:16,869
It's good for a girl to get married, sure.

1560
01:46:16,937 --> 01:46:20,031
But maybe you were right
when you said she won't ever have that.

1561
01:46:20,107 --> 01:46:21,870
She's got to have something.

1562
01:46:21,975 --> 01:46:24,375
Lizzie has got to have something.

1563
01:46:24,811 --> 01:46:26,870
Even if it's only one minute...

1564
01:46:26,947 --> 01:46:30,439
with a man talking quiet
and his hand touching her face.

1565
01:46:31,451 --> 01:46:34,420
And if you go out there
and put one little dark shadow...

1566
01:46:34,488 --> 01:46:37,013
over the brightest time of Lizzie's life...

1567
01:46:37,124 --> 01:46:39,922
I swear, I'll come out after you with a whip!

1568
01:46:40,927 --> 01:46:42,827
Now, you give me that gun.

1569
01:47:00,614 --> 01:47:03,105
Did nobody ever kiss you before I did?

1570
01:47:03,183 --> 01:47:05,651
Yes, once. I was about 13.

1571
01:47:06,086 --> 01:47:08,054
There was a boy
with freckles and red hair...

1572
01:47:08,121 --> 01:47:10,351
and I thought he was
the beginning of the world...

1573
01:47:10,424 --> 01:47:12,153
but he never paid me any mind.

1574
01:47:12,225 --> 01:47:15,456
One day, he was standing around
with a lot of other boys...

1575
01:47:15,529 --> 01:47:18,191
and suddenly he shot over to me
and he kissed me hard...

1576
01:47:18,265 --> 01:47:19,459
right on the mouth.

1577
01:47:19,533 --> 01:47:22,161
And for a minute, I was so stirred up.

1578
01:47:22,836 --> 01:47:25,532
But then he ran back to the other boys...

1579
01:47:25,839 --> 01:47:28,467
and I heard him say,
"I'll kiss anything on a dare...

1580
01:47:28,542 --> 01:47:30,442
"even your old man's pig."

1581
01:47:31,611 --> 01:47:34,774
So, I ran back home,
and I looked at myself in the mirror...

1582
01:47:34,848 --> 01:47:38,340
and from that day on, I knew I was plain.

1583
01:47:40,687 --> 01:47:42,279
Are you plain, Lizzie?

1584
01:47:42,989 --> 01:47:46,083
- No, I'm beautiful.
- You are.

1585
01:47:47,627 --> 01:47:50,152
And when I leave, don't you ever forget it.

1586
01:47:53,767 --> 01:47:56,235
I'll try to remember everything...

1587
01:47:56,903 --> 01:47:58,165
you ever said.

1588
01:48:16,890 --> 01:48:19,256
You think I'll ever get what I'm after?

1589
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:24,027
I don't really know what you are after.

1590
01:48:25,532 --> 01:48:27,796
I'm after a clap of lightning.

1591
01:48:29,603 --> 01:48:33,539
Why is it the things you want
are only there for the blinking of an eye?

1592
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:36,036
Why don't nothing stay?

1593
01:48:37,777 --> 01:48:39,540
Some things stay forever.

1594
01:48:41,481 --> 01:48:42,573
Like what?

1595
01:48:42,949 --> 01:48:44,974
You fall in love with somebody.

1596
01:48:45,585 --> 01:48:48,645
Not me. I don't expect it'll be me...

1597
01:48:49,022 --> 01:48:50,387
just somebody.

1598
01:48:50,891 --> 01:48:53,086
And you get married and have kids.

1599
01:48:53,159 --> 01:48:55,184
And if you do, you'll live forever.

1600
01:48:59,399 --> 01:49:01,731
Sure would like to live forever.

1601
01:49:03,203 --> 01:49:07,367
Maybe you don't take the time
to know things.

1602
01:49:07,908 --> 01:49:11,309
Always on the run. Here, there, nowhere.

1603
01:49:11,678 --> 01:49:15,170
Running away. Keeping your own company.

1604
01:49:16,116 --> 01:49:18,607
Maybe if you'd keep company
with the world...

1605
01:49:18,985 --> 01:49:21,613
- I'd learn to love it?
- You might.

1606
01:49:22,088 --> 01:49:23,749
If you saw it real.

1607
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:28,884
I ain't got the time.

1608
01:49:35,802 --> 01:49:37,326
Then you ain't got...

1609
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:41,668
no world except the one you make up
in your head.

1610
01:49:42,742 --> 01:49:45,142
So you've got to be satisfied with that.

1611
01:49:50,917 --> 01:49:52,714
I got something to tell you.

1612
01:49:54,554 --> 01:49:57,785
You were right.
I'm a liar and a con man and a fake.

1613
01:49:58,625 --> 01:50:00,559
I never made rain in my life.

1614
01:50:01,361 --> 01:50:03,795
Not a single raindrop, nowhere.

1615
01:50:04,531 --> 01:50:07,398
- Not anywhere at all.
- I know.

1616
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:10,992
All my life,
wanting to make a miracle. Nothing.

1617
01:50:11,104 --> 01:50:13,766
- I'm just a great big blowhard.
- No.

1618
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:17,537
No, you're all dreams.

1619
01:50:18,111 --> 01:50:20,636
And it's no good to live in your dreams.

1620
01:50:21,915 --> 01:50:24,509
It's no good to live outside of them.

1621
01:50:27,287 --> 01:50:29,187
Somewhere between the two.

1622
01:50:32,225 --> 01:50:33,453
Yes.

1623
01:50:35,595 --> 01:50:38,086
I'd sure like to live forever.

1624
01:50:44,404 --> 01:50:46,395
Lizzie, would you...

1625
01:50:47,007 --> 01:50:49,635
Would you like me to stick around
for a while?

1626
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:53,006
- Did I hear you right?
- Not for good, you understand.

1627
01:50:53,079 --> 01:50:54,569
Just for a few days.

1628
01:50:54,848 --> 01:50:58,045
- You're not fooling me, are you, Starbuck?
- No, I mean it.

1629
01:50:58,118 --> 01:50:59,779
Would you stay? Would you?

1630
01:50:59,853 --> 01:51:02,413
- A few days, yes.
- Oh, my goodness.

1631
01:51:04,124 --> 01:51:06,922
I can't stand it. I just can't stand it.

1632
01:51:07,193 --> 01:51:10,651
You look up in the sky
and you long for a star.

1633
01:51:10,730 --> 01:51:12,288
And you know you'll never get it.

1634
01:51:12,365 --> 01:51:16,131
Then one night, you look down
and there it is, shining in your hands.

1635
01:51:19,673 --> 01:51:20,799
I'm going in.

1636
01:51:20,874 --> 01:51:23,934
- I'm gonna tell them you're staying.
- I'll go with you.

1637
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:28,041
No. I want to tell my father by myself.

1638
01:51:42,362 --> 01:51:46,423
- I think I saw a wisp of a cloud.
- You're seeing things.

1639
01:51:46,499 --> 01:51:50,128
No, just the smallest wisp of a cloud
floating across the moon...

1640
01:51:50,203 --> 01:51:53,570
- no bigger than a mare's tail.
- You're talking like Starbuck.

1641
01:51:55,141 --> 01:51:56,233
Yes, I am.

1642
01:51:57,610 --> 01:52:00,101
- Where is he?
- In the tack room.

1643
01:52:02,415 --> 01:52:04,315
Why don't you comb your hair?

1644
01:52:04,784 --> 01:52:06,513
I like it this way.

1645
01:52:07,887 --> 01:52:09,912
I've got no more pins.

1646
01:52:10,323 --> 01:52:13,383
- But I've got something else.
- What, Lizzie?

1647
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:16,691
Pop, I've got me a beau.

1648
01:52:17,130 --> 01:52:18,154
Have you, honey?

1649
01:52:18,231 --> 01:52:21,928
Not an always-beau,
but a beau for meanwhile, until he goes.

1650
01:52:23,002 --> 01:52:26,369
Pop, the world's turned clear around.

1651
01:52:27,874 --> 01:52:29,705
Why don't you tell her, Pop?

1652
01:52:30,276 --> 01:52:31,766
Tell me what, Pop?

1653
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:34,970
Tell me what?

1654
01:52:36,182 --> 01:52:38,173
You were right about that fellow.

1655
01:52:38,251 --> 01:52:42,119
- He's a liar and a con man...
- There's nothing bad about him, he's good.

1656
01:52:42,622 --> 01:52:45,750
He's good, and he's so alone.

1657
01:52:46,493 --> 01:52:48,222
He's so terribly alone.

1658
01:52:48,828 --> 01:52:51,729
- Lizzie, come here.
- What?

1659
01:52:55,635 --> 01:52:56,624
Look.

1660
01:52:59,506 --> 01:53:02,907
What's he here for?
What's he doing on that wagon?

1661
01:53:03,643 --> 01:53:05,941
- Pop.
- He's getting evidence, Lizzie.

1662
01:53:06,012 --> 01:53:07,775
- He's here to lock him up.
- No.

1663
01:53:07,847 --> 01:53:11,010
- Stay here, Lizzie.
- He has no right to arrest him.

1664
01:53:11,084 --> 01:53:13,211
- I'm afraid he has.
- We've got to help him.

1665
01:53:13,286 --> 01:53:16,187
Now, Lizzie, quit it.
There's nothing we can do for him.

1666
01:53:16,256 --> 01:53:19,191
- Not for him, for me.
- For you, Lizzie?

1667
01:53:19,759 --> 01:53:21,556
I don't think he knows who you are.

1668
01:53:21,628 --> 01:53:23,823
I think he just dreamed you up in his head.

1669
01:53:23,897 --> 01:53:24,886
No.

1670
01:53:26,065 --> 01:53:28,465
He sees me as real as you do.

1671
01:53:28,735 --> 01:53:32,193
Do you believe that, Lizzie?
Do you think he sees you real?

1672
01:53:32,438 --> 01:53:33,530
Answer me.

1673
01:53:34,641 --> 01:53:35,938
Yes, he does.

1674
01:53:36,342 --> 01:53:38,742
All right, then you better help him get away.

1675
01:53:38,812 --> 01:53:40,871
No, Lizzie, no.
I'm not gonna let you do that.

1676
01:53:40,947 --> 01:53:43,142
- Let me go.
- Let her go, Noah.

1677
01:53:55,795 --> 01:53:57,888
- You're awake.
- Hello, File.

1678
01:53:58,231 --> 01:54:00,358
- They told me you were asleep.
- Did they?

1679
01:54:00,433 --> 01:54:02,492
- Excuse me.
- Where you going?

1680
01:54:02,802 --> 01:54:04,963
- Nowhere.
- Wait, what are you rushing off for?

1681
01:54:05,038 --> 01:54:08,496
I was just wondering
what you were doing on the wagon?

1682
01:54:08,708 --> 01:54:10,403
Where you going, Lizzie?

1683
01:54:11,878 --> 01:54:13,345
On the wagon.

1684
01:54:15,615 --> 01:54:18,413
I don't want this family mixed up in trouble.

1685
01:54:18,651 --> 01:54:22,485
- Now, tell me where that fellow is, please.
- He left about an hour ago.

1686
01:54:22,889 --> 01:54:24,880
- Where'd he go?
- Pedleyville.

1687
01:54:25,024 --> 01:54:28,289
- How'd he go? The wagon's still here.
- He took Jim's horse.

1688
01:54:28,528 --> 01:54:30,393
That's it, he took my horse.

1689
01:54:32,632 --> 01:54:34,532
What's going on here?

1690
01:54:34,601 --> 01:54:37,468
I ask you questions,
you tell me a pack of lies.

1691
01:54:37,537 --> 01:54:38,561
And for what?

1692
01:54:38,638 --> 01:54:41,436
A stranger, a man
who don't mean anything to you.

1693
01:54:43,376 --> 01:54:44,502
Or does he?

1694
01:54:46,746 --> 01:54:49,374
Maybe you better answer that question.

1695
01:54:49,515 --> 01:54:51,415
Wait a minute. They said you were asleep...

1696
01:54:51,484 --> 01:54:53,975
and you weren't. Why were they lying?
Where were you?

1697
01:54:54,053 --> 01:54:58,149
It's got nothing to do with you.
It's got a lot to do with me. Now, tell me.

1698
01:55:04,397 --> 01:55:07,230
Starbuck! Go away!

1699
01:55:08,468 --> 01:55:11,301
- Run!
- Lizzie, stay here.

1700
01:55:12,372 --> 01:55:14,636
Starbuck, run.

1701
01:55:19,279 --> 01:55:20,644
What's going on?

1702
01:55:22,548 --> 01:55:24,277
Sheriff. You're under arrest.

1703
01:55:24,350 --> 01:55:27,319
If you hadn't have been singing,
you'd have heard me.

1704
01:55:28,454 --> 01:55:30,081
I never regret singing.

1705
01:55:30,556 --> 01:55:32,285
All right, get in the car.

1706
01:55:37,230 --> 01:55:39,630
- Wait a minute. Let him go.
- What?

1707
01:55:39,699 --> 01:55:42,634
- Let him get away.
- I can't do that, Lizzie.

1708
01:55:43,002 --> 01:55:44,162
Here, look at that bulletin.

1709
01:55:44,237 --> 01:55:46,797
We don't have to look at that.
We've been looking at him.

1710
01:55:46,873 --> 01:55:49,637
- It's all I got to go by.
- You've got us to go by, File.

1711
01:55:49,709 --> 01:55:51,506
We spent the evening with this fellow.

1712
01:55:51,577 --> 01:55:53,875
We took a chance with him.
You take a chance with us.

1713
01:55:53,947 --> 01:55:55,209
Give up, folks.

1714
01:55:55,448 --> 01:55:58,906
A sheriff's a sheriff,
and he can't see any further than his badge.

1715
01:55:58,985 --> 01:56:00,452
Is that true, File?

1716
01:56:00,987 --> 01:56:03,854
Let him go. Please.

1717
01:56:09,662 --> 01:56:11,789
Ain't heard a word from you, Noah.

1718
01:56:11,965 --> 01:56:15,423
Be a lot of people around here
who'd think I broke the law, right?

1719
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:22,067
Nobody I know of.

1720
01:56:26,846 --> 01:56:29,144
All right, get going. Get out of here.

1721
01:56:29,582 --> 01:56:32,881
- Well, I'm a son of a gun.
- Go on.

1722
01:56:46,065 --> 01:56:49,125
Lizzie, it's lonely as dying out there.

1723
01:56:49,235 --> 01:56:50,827
Will you come with me?

1724
01:56:55,241 --> 01:56:58,335
- Starbuck.
- I'm talking to you, Lizzie.

1725
01:56:58,411 --> 01:57:01,380
- Come on.
- Lizzie, don't go!

1726
01:57:07,387 --> 01:57:08,820
What?

1727
01:57:09,389 --> 01:57:10,947
What did you say?

1728
01:57:11,391 --> 01:57:13,723
I said, don't go.

1729
01:57:25,538 --> 01:57:28,336
- What'll I do?
- Hurry up, Lizzie, please.

1730
01:57:32,612 --> 01:57:36,173
What am I going to do?
Pop, what am I going to do?

1731
01:57:36,249 --> 01:57:38,911
Whatever you do,
remember you've been asked.

1732
01:57:38,985 --> 01:57:42,751
You don't never have to go through life
a woman who ain't been asked.

1733
01:57:44,190 --> 01:57:46,920
I'm sure asking, Lizzie. Lizzie, listen.

1734
01:57:46,993 --> 01:57:49,188
You're beautiful now.
But you come with me...

1735
01:57:49,262 --> 01:57:51,696
and you'll be so beautiful,
you'll light up the world.

1736
01:57:51,764 --> 01:57:54,358
- Don't say that.
- You'll never be Lizzie no more.

1737
01:57:54,767 --> 01:57:56,257
You'll be Melisande.

1738
01:57:56,669 --> 01:57:59,229
- Starbuck, you said the wrong thing.
- Melisande?

1739
01:57:59,305 --> 01:58:01,773
What the devil does that mean?
Her name's Lizzie Curry.

1740
01:58:01,841 --> 01:58:04,275
It's not good enough. Not for her.

1741
01:58:04,343 --> 01:58:06,470
- It's good enough for me.
- Come on.

1742
01:58:07,647 --> 01:58:08,636
No.

1743
01:58:09,248 --> 01:58:10,909
I got to be Lizzie.

1744
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:13,946
Melisande is a name for one night.

1745
01:58:14,754 --> 01:58:18,952
But Lizzie can do me my whole life long.

1746
01:58:36,509 --> 01:58:40,036
Sorry about the rain, boys.
But then, I didn't stay my full time.

1747
01:58:40,113 --> 01:58:42,104
So here's your $100.

1748
01:58:43,883 --> 01:58:46,784
Another day, maybe, in a dry season.

1749
01:58:47,487 --> 01:58:49,182
So long, folks.

1750
01:58:51,257 --> 01:58:52,849
Starbuck, wait!

1751
01:59:14,046 --> 01:59:15,411
Thank you, File.

1752
01:59:16,282 --> 01:59:17,374
Thank you.

1753
01:59:21,487 --> 01:59:23,216
You got your hair down.

1754
01:59:24,824 --> 01:59:26,655
Yeah, she sure has changed.

1755
01:59:31,297 --> 01:59:33,629
Jimmy, for Pete's sake,
stop beating that drum.

1756
01:59:34,033 --> 01:59:35,523
I ain't beating no drum.

1757
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:45,407
It's lightning.

1758
01:59:46,379 --> 01:59:47,471
Lightning!

1759
02:00:11,237 --> 02:00:13,705
- It's raining.
- Yes, it is.

1760
02:00:15,041 --> 02:00:16,702
Rain!

1761
02:00:18,945 --> 02:00:21,539
Rain! Yippee!

1762
02:00:22,148 --> 02:00:24,309
He said 24 hours!

1763
02:00:28,421 --> 02:00:31,413
Hey, it's Starbuck!

1764
02:00:38,564 --> 02:00:40,930
Rain, folks! Rain!

1765
02:00:42,335 --> 02:00:46,032
For the first time in my life, rain!

1766
02:00:47,406 --> 02:00:50,500
- Give me my $100.
- Give him his $100, Noah!

1767
02:00:50,576 --> 02:00:54,171
- Thanks, Starbuck.
- So long, beautiful!

1768
02:01:08,327 --> 02:01:10,227
Rain!
