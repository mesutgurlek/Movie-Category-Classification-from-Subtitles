1
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,328
Hey!

2
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,475
The sheriff ain't in.
Come back tomorrow.

3
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,697
You say something?

4
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,878
I only said the sheriff ain't in.

5
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,593
Well, where would we be
lucky enough to find him?

6
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,679
Fishing.

7
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,723
He'll be back tomorrow
for the hanging.

8
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,063
If I can help...

9
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,731
Why not.

10
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,567
You could tell us something.

11
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,277
Sure. What?

12
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:18,240
Some time ago, there was
a reward out for Bill San Antonio.

13
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,741
Five thousand, I believe.

14
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,786
I can check up.
It will only take a little while.

15
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,205
- I'll be...
- Take my word for it.

16
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,708
Here's all that's left of him.

17
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,252
Enough for the reward.

18
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,713
Our old friend died with his boots off.

19
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,425
No, I'm sorry. We need sure proof.

20
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:42,097
Unfortunately, I can't supply you
with "sure proof", as you call it.

21
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,351
He got blown up.

22
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,813
Come on, Hutch.
Let's not waste any more time.

23
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,122
Hey! What shall I do with these?

24
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,751
Play with them in your free time. Ha!

25
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,850
What can I do for you?

26
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,353
Take three or four men

27
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,397
and have them carry in the case
that's on that wagon.

28
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,566
And tell your friend to keep
his eyes peeled.

29
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,360
There's 300,000 in there.

30
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,320
Dollars?

31
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,073
As good as.

32
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,325
It's gold.

33
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:46,620
Same as got robbed from a train
on the MK&T a month ago,

34
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,705
and which we were lucky
enough to pick up.

35
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,666
- Really, sir, I...
- Just one more thing.

36
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,876
Where can we find the owner
of this piggy bank?

37
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,254
Mr. Harold's office is upstairs,

38
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,215
but the president isn't scheduled
to see anyone today,

39
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:01,718
Mr... I'm sorry,
I didn't catch your name,

40
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,512
and unless I know that, I...

41
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,889
I never told you. Come on, Hutch.

42
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,100
Hey, you two.

43
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,811
If Mr. Pick says the president
won't see you,

44
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:14,398
it means you ain't going
anywhere, understand?

45
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,112
Get a move on.

46
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,365
Let's get that case out there
unloaded now, buttercup.

47
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:26,243
There's no use in running risks.

48
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,780
My good man, I think you better
announce us... to your boss.

49
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:08,577
But weren't you told that Mr. Harold
receives callers only by appointment?

50
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:11,205
He'll receive us. You'll see.

51
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,041
Just say it's San Antonio
who wants to talk to him.

52
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:18,253
You could be our Lord in person,
it would be the same thing.

53
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:31,725
Don't forget, huh?
Tell him, "Bill San Antonio".

54
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,608
If he sees us, it means
he and Bill were in cahoots.

55
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,653
Because a bandit that steals
a bank's gold from the train

56
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,322
is likely to be the last person
in the world

57
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:48,116
to know the president of that bank.

58
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,453
So if Bill was telling the truth,

59
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,539
and he kept swearing he was,

60
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,999
then half the gold he robbed
in the past few years

61
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,961
finished in the pockets
of that gentleman, right?

62
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,131
That's why he won't see us.

63
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,727
All we have to do is look at him

64
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,105
to understand it's impossible
a man like him

65
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:21,984
could have got mixed up
with that son of a bitch.

66
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,155
Oh, may he rest in peace.

67
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,415
Let's get out of here, Cat.

68
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,917
We might as well wait.

69
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,128
If I'm right...

70
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:45,507
...I'll make him spit up
all the loose change.

71
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:49,761
There's enough of that
for both of us to retire on.

72
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,266
Come in, gentlemen, please.

73
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,378
You think we overdid it?

74
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,840
No.

75
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:17,266
A small personal gift from Mr. Harold.

76
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,101
How should I put it?

77
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:23,730
A little memento of his appreciation
for what we've done for him.

78
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,566
In gold, mister.

79
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,236
Get it ready. We'll be by
in a couple of hours.

80
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,614
You're gonna need a little time.

81
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,328
Gold, huh?

82
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,294
- How does it feel to be rich?
- I don't know.

83
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,838
I'm not used to it yet. Hey, watch it.

84
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,798
A quarter of a dollar
and few minutes' patience,

85
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:52,050
and you'll have a picture of yourself
just as you are now

86
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,927
that will last centuries.

87
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,931
Take advantage now.
Tomorrow could be too late.

88
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:00,642
Hold still, please.

89
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,438
- Hold still, please!
- You know,

90
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,523
- I never had my picture taken.
- One, two,

91
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,693
- Now's a good a time as any.
- three, four, five,

92
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,987
- No.
- six, seven,

93
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:18,827
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twe...

94
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,415
No, no, no, no, no. Now,
a little more to the left. No.

95
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:27,920
Now. Now. This way. Here you are.

96
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,547
Now, good, now. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

97
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:35,385
No, no, no. Now, don't move.
Now, that's right.

98
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,640
This way, you won't get tired.

99
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:45,479
Yeah, lean on it. That's it. There.

100
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,857
See how simple it is? Magnificent.

101
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:51,026
A stupendous sight,
but I know what's missing.

102
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:54,196
Just a minute. It costs only
a few cents more,

103
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,865
but wait till you see the effect.

104
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:03,288
Now, perfect.

105
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,707
Hold still now, please.

106
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,876
Just a matter of seconds.

107
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:18,220
One, two, three, four, five,

108
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,639
six, seven...

109
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,975
Looking at you, I don't know
which one is the pigeon.

110
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:26,103
...nine, ten, eleven.

111
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,063
You moved!

112
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,691
Oh, my dove!

113
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:35,153
The man shot my dove!
That's the only one I have!

114
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,824
Forget it.

115
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:51,253
Now, why don't you get smart.

116
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,090
Why should I?

117
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,177
He ain't fooling around.

118
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,470
Because I say so!

119
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,434
Hey, you!

120
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,162
Come on.

121
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,790
Come on. Hold him down.

122
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,610
The suits they make nowadays,

123
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,863
they sure aren't worth a damn.

124
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:44,301
I've had enough fun.

125
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:46,720
Let's go get our money at the bank.

126
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:50,766
Get ourselves out of this lousy village.

127
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,978
- That's it.
- Little more.

128
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,274
Look at that, would you?

129
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,943
Take the rope.

130
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:05,447
They sure got nasty folks
around here.

131
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:08,116
They hang people too.

132
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,802
I'll repeat it for the last time.

133
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:29,012
Yes or no?

134
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,515
I want an immediate answer.

135
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:37,688
All right. So you're not interested.

136
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,443
Do you or don't you want
to understand

137
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,320
I'm giving you an opportunity

138
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:48,615
to save your neck
from that damned rope?

139
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,047
When I give my word, I keep it.

140
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:07,342
I said tonight, and tonight someone
will get you out of here.

141
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,846
You'll have to take care of the rest.

142
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,307
But if I know you, you'll find
a way to recover the money

143
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,393
those sons of bitches stole from me.

144
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:23,525
I lost a partner recently.

145
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:27,112
If you're interested,
you can take his place.

146
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:30,073
We were friends once.

147
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,534
We can be again.

148
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,244
It's up to you, and you know it.

149
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:37,206
- All you have to do is just...
- Where can I find them?

150
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,089
As far as I know, they're still in town.

151
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:48,217
They're in no hurry.

152
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,133
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, fella.

153
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,511
- It's gonna rain soon. We need it.
- Yeah, we need it.

154
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:35,597
Come inside.
I got something to tell you.

155
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:40,811
Well, why don't you boys just
sit down and have a drink.

156
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:44,773
I just had a bottle delivered
to me that'll really...

157
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:11,592
Get moving. Sooner we get
out of here, the better it is.

158
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:17,181
Come on, hurry!

159
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:23,478
I said, hurry up!

160
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,949
You, huh?

161
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:02,851
I wonder if it works.

162
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:05,687
Come on.

163
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,397
Let's go.

164
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:16,114
It works.

165
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,788
Pretty, isn't it?

166
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:51,084
It's like the life of a man,
beautiful while it lasts.

167
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:55,672
- I told you this afternoon...
- You told me too much.

168
00:20:56,507 --> 00:20:59,468
In my opinion, you're getting old.

169
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:07,100
Once, you used to count your words.

170
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:14,149
But this afternoon,
you told me so much...

171
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:20,197
...I almost forgot to ask
about our mutual friends.

172
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:22,241
Our friends?

173
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:25,536
Still not thinking of that old story,
are you?

174
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:30,707
No. Simple curiosity.

175
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:36,505
You know...

176
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:41,510
...15 years of hard labor sort of cuts
into your social life.

177
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:45,138
What are they doing now?
Where are they, around here?

178
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:49,184
No. Paco went back to Mexico.
Years ago.

179
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:52,563
Years ago?

180
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,233
And Drake? What about Drake?

181
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:00,362
He settled in Fair City, near Memphis,
went into business.

182
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:04,366
- Big business, huh?
- Yes. He's gone up in the world.

183
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,577
But as far as you're concerned,
you don't need them.

184
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:10,205
- I'm here to help you any way I...
- I know, I know.

185
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:13,208
You're here to help me
make up for the lost time.

186
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:17,796
You told me. You told me.

187
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:21,341
- You like them?
- What?

188
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:25,596
Classy, huh?

189
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:31,894
And comfortable too.

190
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:35,898
If it weren't for these, I would've
made a mistake tonight.

191
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:38,692
I would not have noticed... this.

192
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:41,570
Instead, what do you know?
My eyes fell on this

193
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:43,864
just as I was putting my boots on.

194
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:50,287
You know, it's bad taking
too many precautions.

195
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,293
That's better.

196
00:22:58,045 --> 00:22:59,630
You know...

197
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:03,300
...the idea of killing a deputy
with my knife

198
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:06,178
wouldn't have come from
the kind of people you sent,

199
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:09,223
but from a more refined mind.

200
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:17,064
I no sooner finish those 15 years

201
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:20,776
when I'm beaten up in a saloon
and robbed of my knife.

202
00:23:20,943 --> 00:23:24,238
And while I'm asleep, that knife
winds up in somebody's chest.

203
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:27,115
Somebody I don't even know.

204
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:30,702
But that little detail, the law overlooks.

205
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:34,164
And before I know it,
I'm behind bars again.

206
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:38,585
Those two you sort of hinted
you wanted taken care of,

207
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:42,214
they must have given you
a rough time...

208
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:45,884
...if, after you get a rope around
my neck without dirtying your hands,

209
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:48,971
you suddenly change your filthy mind,

210
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:53,475
all in the name of old friendship,
you say.

211
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:03,151
Actually, it's because those two
sort of took the shine off your image.

212
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,571
And you had no one on hand
quick enough to restore it

213
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:07,197
by finishing them off.

214
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,078
Isn't that it, partner?

215
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:36,435
You keep on the side of the law.

216
00:24:36,602 --> 00:24:38,353
But me, with a jailbreaking charge

217
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,648
and the departed soul of a deputy
hanging over my head...

218
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:46,153
"Easy to handle",
you must have thought.

219
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,451
You're out of your mind.

220
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:54,828
Out of my mind?

221
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,126
Prove it to me.

222
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,255
Prove to me you won't double-cross
me the way you did 15 years ago.

223
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:07,925
Or the way you did
just one month ago.

224
00:25:09,635 --> 00:25:13,096
Do I make myself clear, partner?

225
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:15,557
This time, I want proof.

226
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:17,559
Concrete proof.

227
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:19,603
What proof?

228
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:23,941
Yeah... what?

229
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:44,753
There, that's proof enough for me.

230
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:52,636
Buy myself a nice little farm...

231
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:55,889
...few head of cattle. Not many.

232
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:59,726
I'll have enough income left
to live on for a hundred years.

233
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:01,270
Income.

234
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:03,397
Got any idea what income is?

235
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:05,065
You put the money in the bank,

236
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:08,360
and every month,
the bank pays you interest.

237
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:10,571
You go to sleep...

238
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:13,407
...and meanwhile,
the interest is growing.

239
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:16,451
You go fishing,
and the interest increases.

240
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:19,955
And your capital stays untouched.

241
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:25,794
You sleeping?

242
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:27,796
You'd keep quiet, maybe I could.

243
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:30,716
Takes a smart man
to understand you.

244
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:34,344
You put your hands
on a mountain of money...

245
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:36,388
...no strings attached...

246
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:40,392
...and for you, it's the most natural
thing in the world, and you sleep.

247
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,935
Just sleep.

248
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:52,821
Hi.

249
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:56,742
Hello, friends!

250
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:06,376
There's a rumor you just
cleaned out a bank.

251
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:09,630
It so happens I had savings
in that bank.

252
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,967
Never mind the jokes.

253
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:18,222
Oh, don't take it so badly.

254
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:20,933
You're both young and strong.

255
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:23,393
Me, I have to make up
for so much wasted time.

256
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,187
There are many things
I have to attend to.

257
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:30,651
So don't worry.
I just need a small amount.

258
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:33,654
Just enough for the bare necessities.

259
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:41,745
Well, no.

260
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,082
Money corrupts Man. It softens him.

261
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:49,419
So to keep you young and pure,
I think I'll take everything.

262
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,218
You'll thank me for this someday.

263
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,348
Listen, before you go,
there's one thing I'd do if I were you.

264
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:06,228
What is that?

265
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,230
Shoot me.

266
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:11,942
What a nice idea.

267
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:16,572
The world is too small for you to get
far enough away from me.

268
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,907
I'll find you sooner or later.

269
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,411
Listen, tiny, you must have worms
in your brain.

270
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,246
Cacapoulos doesn't go
around shooting people

271
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:25,956
just to have something to do.

272
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:28,584
Then give me a loaded gun.

273
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:34,089
Oh, no, I can't do that.

274
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:36,383
My grandfather always used to say,

275
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,803
"Even if you have a small advantage,
be careful not to lose it.

276
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:43,432
"In the best of circumstances,
you'd be considered a fool."

277
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:46,059
And I always find myself in trouble

278
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:49,104
if I don't follow
my grandfather's advice.

279
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:51,732
So long, friends!

280
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:26,975
Shoot me.

281
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:29,770
You shoot me.

282
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:34,233
A peasant.

283
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:38,237
You see? A peasant
on a dirty donkey.

284
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:41,031
And a minute later, you're lying
ass up on the ground,

285
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:44,409
without having the time
to say, "ouch".

286
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,788
We let ourselves be fooled
like amateurs.

287
00:29:48,205 --> 00:29:49,456
My farm.

288
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:51,667
My interest sitting in the bank.

289
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,001
Shoot me, Cat!

290
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,963
Come on, shoot me!

291
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:58,507
What are you waiting for?

292
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:01,844
Shoot me. Shoot me...!

293
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,596
Hey, wait a minute.

294
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:06,682
What are you doing?

295
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,433
You gone loco?

296
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,018
Put down the gun, Cat.

297
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:14,189
And you save your breath.

298
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:17,192
We have 30 miles to do
before we see a living soul.

299
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:14,333
Stay here. They need
water and food, I'd say.

300
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:21,215
The murrain falls on us.

301
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:24,468
And before Jim and I can make out
what's going on,

302
00:31:24,635 --> 00:31:29,932
all the bulls and cows are in pastures
with their legs straight up like pegs.

303
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:33,393
And we're left with just about nothing.

304
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,939
Well, we were worse off
than when me and my old lady

305
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:39,066
came here 30 years ago.

306
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:40,692
Worse off, indeed.

307
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:43,278
Without a penny
for a blind man's song.

308
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:47,866
That's how it was.

309
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:51,286
I was just thinking
of finishing myself off,

310
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:54,248
- when guess what happens.
- What happened?

311
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,500
A miracle, that's what happened.

312
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,962
- Guess who appears in front of me.
- Who appeared in front of you?

313
00:32:00,838 --> 00:32:03,632
Our savior.
Oh, well, it didn't look like him.

314
00:32:03,841 --> 00:32:06,134
He gets off his horse,
and he says to me,

315
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:07,719
"Hey, old man.

316
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:10,889
"You look worse than an undertaker
without a job."

317
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:13,851
So while he's eating, because
he looked hungrier than you did,

318
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:15,853
I tell him all my troubles.

319
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:17,938
Of course, I'm just letting off steam,

320
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:20,399
and he don't even seem
to be listening to me,

321
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:23,360
when all of sudden,
he comes out with a big laugh,

322
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:25,070
and he says,

323
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:27,197
"Is 5,000 enough?"

324
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:30,617
And I says, "What?"
And then he says,

325
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:32,244
"Write out a receipt.

326
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:36,540
"I have an idea that you're going
to get a loan from Cacapoulos."

327
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,671
Pa wanted him to stay,
but Mr. Cacapoulos is a man

328
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,715
who likes to see happy people
around him.

329
00:32:44,882 --> 00:32:46,800
So he left with a strange man
who earns his living

330
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:49,178
walking on a rope a hundred feet
above the ground,

331
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:51,847
and he went into town
with his wagon for the fair.

332
00:32:52,222 --> 00:32:55,017
If we don't hurry,
that crook won't have a cent left.

333
00:32:55,184 --> 00:32:58,103
Nice to give to charity
when it's other people's money.

334
00:32:58,687 --> 00:33:01,857
Quiet, please. This is very dangerous.

335
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:04,484
Thank you.

336
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:07,488
Quiet, please.

337
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:13,368
Step right over this way...

338
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:21,418
Step right up here.

339
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:27,216
Well, how about this?

340
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:31,720
What's the matter with you?

341
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:34,765
Why, you little bitch. Come here.

342
00:33:34,932 --> 00:33:38,393
Get your hands off me! Please! Help!

343
00:33:38,602 --> 00:33:41,897
Don't! Please let go!

344
00:33:51,824 --> 00:33:53,116
Skip it.

345
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:57,412
He needs a dozen like you
before he even starts having fun.

346
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:04,920
Even if you're an idiot, I don't see
why you wanna die so young.

347
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:18,058
I'll join you if you don't mind.

348
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:28,235
All right. If somebody's ready to start.

349
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:46,587
I warned you.

350
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:14,156
He left last night.

351
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:17,618
Told us he was going all the way
to Tula on the other side of the border.

352
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:19,495
He said he had
an old account to settle.

353
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:20,829
Did he...?

354
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:22,998
Did he give you a loan too?

355
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,919
To tell you the truth,
he offered me one.

356
00:35:27,669 --> 00:35:29,254
But I refused.

357
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:33,842
We've always been able to make it
on our own, at least until today.

358
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:35,677
You'd have done all right today too.

359
00:35:35,886 --> 00:35:38,305
You certainly didn't need us
to handle those guys.

360
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:41,558
Thank you. You're very kind.

361
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:44,353
Mr. Cacapoulos, too, is very kind.

362
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:46,813
He seems to wanna
make everybody happy.

363
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,941
And that's very nice of him.

364
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:51,109
Except, it seems to me,

365
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:53,529
it's very hard to make
everybody happy.

366
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:59,535
It seems to me that
Mr. Cacapoulos is not very thrifty.

367
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:09,962
Well...

368
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:12,548
...I think it's about time we got going.

369
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:07,895
Looks like this is it.

370
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:25,472
You like to bet?

371
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:29,643
- This fiesta, we're paying for it.
- You can count on it.

372
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:47,244
- He dead, that one there?
- "No entiendo, señor".

373
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:50,831
<i>Este hombre, ¿ está muerto?</i>

374
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:53,083
<i>¿ El nuestro benefactor, muerto?</i>

375
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,878
No, "señor". No, not dead.

376
00:38:56,044 --> 00:38:59,298
Is... He's good to us. Not dead.

377
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:00,883
No", señor".

378
00:39:17,858 --> 00:39:21,069
If I could get my fingers
around his neck...

379
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:35,876
Listen, Miguel, I wanna play a joke
on those two gringos over there.

380
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:37,794
See them?

381
00:39:50,224 --> 00:39:52,100
"Bienvenidos" to Tula, "señores".

382
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:19,503
Take it easy. This stuff will knock you
right out if you're not careful.

383
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,341
Not me.

384
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:09,511
The hell with it. It's me that's paying.

385
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,706
Now, then. Piece of paper, huh?

386
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:22,876
You ugly little cockroach,
I'm gonna kill you!

387
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:26,713
We can't talk in here.
Let's go outside. I can't hear you.

388
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:31,260
We got nothing to say to each other.
Just spit out my money, and fast.

389
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,762
And if I don't?

390
00:42:40,477 --> 00:42:43,021
I wouldn't be carrying it
with me anyway.

391
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:48,277
It's no use looking for Cat.

392
00:42:48,485 --> 00:42:51,613
By now, he's about ten miles
from here thinking he'll find me.

393
00:42:52,322 --> 00:42:53,615
What do you mean?

394
00:42:54,992 --> 00:42:56,368
Follow me.

395
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:03,458
You know, tiny, in your condition,
I could lay you out flat.

396
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:05,919
Very quickly, without any trouble.

397
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:10,215
Why don't you try.

398
00:43:48,253 --> 00:43:50,672
During my travels, I was thinking.

399
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:53,008
I decided to give you back
your money.

400
00:43:53,175 --> 00:43:55,052
All of it. I don't need it anymore.

401
00:43:55,427 --> 00:43:58,180
Sure, you done nothing else
but spread it around.

402
00:43:58,388 --> 00:44:00,182
Small change.

403
00:44:00,349 --> 00:44:02,768
And anyway, I'll give you back
even that.

404
00:44:02,935 --> 00:44:05,687
There's somebody here
who owes me a big debt.

405
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:08,899
To have debts owed you is one thing.

406
00:44:11,235 --> 00:44:13,028
To collect them is another.

407
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:17,324
He'll pay.

408
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:21,411
All I want is you two
to leave me alone till I get it.

409
00:44:21,912 --> 00:44:24,665
And then I'll give it back to you,
seeing as you care so much about it.

410
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:27,751
It seems money is nothing to you,
I guess.

411
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:29,837
You're wrong.

412
00:44:30,003 --> 00:44:33,841
Once, I was convinced there was
something more important. I...

413
00:44:53,569 --> 00:44:56,155
Try to imagine that you
have three friends...

414
00:44:56,822 --> 00:44:59,783
...that you've shared everything
with them since you were a boy.

415
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:02,077
Even these.

416
00:45:03,745 --> 00:45:07,124
Imagine, one day
you clean out a bank...

417
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:09,960
...and while you get away...

418
00:45:10,919 --> 00:45:13,130
...half the town on your heels...

419
00:45:14,423 --> 00:45:16,216
...one of your good friends
pulls out a gun

420
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:18,051
and shoots your horse
out from under you.

421
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:22,598
And then they shout,

422
00:45:22,764 --> 00:45:25,934
"You hold them off
till we catch our breath.

423
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,937
"Then we'll come back and free you."

424
00:45:39,698 --> 00:45:42,451
Fifteen years I waited for them.

425
00:45:44,786 --> 00:45:46,872
Doing hard labor.

426
00:45:48,332 --> 00:45:50,667
And the best part is,
they didn't forget.

427
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:52,294
Oh, no.

428
00:45:53,086 --> 00:45:57,174
They were waiting till I got out
so they could send me straight to hell.

429
00:45:57,341 --> 00:46:00,886
Lower me gently
into a nice new grave.

430
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:04,973
And put a stone on my head.

431
00:46:15,108 --> 00:46:18,403
But these friends of yours...

432
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:21,114
...how many did you say there are?

433
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,660
Two.

434
00:46:24,827 --> 00:46:27,496
There were three.
I took care of the first.

435
00:46:29,498 --> 00:46:32,209
And the second?

436
00:46:33,085 --> 00:46:34,503
Paco?

437
00:46:35,379 --> 00:46:37,214
It's his turn tomorrow.

438
00:46:38,006 --> 00:46:40,342
I don't like to look on the dark side...

439
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:44,263
...but suppose, instead of your friend
Paco, it's you who gets shot?

440
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:46,932
Would you explain to me
why I have to go through hell

441
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:48,308
just to get back what's mine?

442
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:51,562
You don't trust me?
I have another idea.

443
00:46:51,979 --> 00:46:53,021
What?

444
00:46:53,772 --> 00:46:56,066
If you want, you can come with me.

445
00:46:57,276 --> 00:46:58,986
Sure, sure.

446
00:46:59,736 --> 00:47:04,575
Why not? The two of us together.
Be easy as child's play.

447
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:07,995
Well, now, that's a wonderful idea.

448
00:47:18,714 --> 00:47:20,382
<i>¡Fuego!</i>

449
00:47:25,053 --> 00:47:29,183
<i>Preparados, apunten, ¡fuego!</i>

450
00:47:33,478 --> 00:47:35,272
<i>Preparados.</i>

451
00:47:36,356 --> 00:47:37,858
<i>Apunten.</i>

452
00:47:38,025 --> 00:47:39,902
<i>¡Fuego!</i>

453
00:47:41,487 --> 00:47:47,409
Another one. Enrique Ramirez
Sanchez Cornejo y Mendoza.

454
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:54,750
The charge?

455
00:47:55,792 --> 00:48:00,297
He refused the opportunity to fight
for the liberty and independence

456
00:48:00,464 --> 00:48:02,549
of our great country.

457
00:48:05,636 --> 00:48:07,471
For the defense.

458
00:48:08,972 --> 00:48:10,557
A pig.

459
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,810
The jury?

460
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:15,812
Rebel.

461
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:19,441
Rebel.

462
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,860
He's a rebel.

463
00:48:23,278 --> 00:48:24,863
Guilty.

464
00:48:28,659 --> 00:48:29,868
Another one.

465
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:35,582
Ramirez Fernandez Sanchez
Eugenio y Mendoza.

466
00:48:35,749 --> 00:48:37,251
Take your hat off!

467
00:49:34,266 --> 00:49:37,311
Like you said, huh?
It's gonna be child's play.

468
00:49:38,353 --> 00:49:39,480
Leave it to me.

469
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:46,069
<i>¡Cargáis!</i>

470
00:49:46,236 --> 00:49:47,696
<i>¡Preparados!</i>

471
00:49:47,863 --> 00:49:51,867
- "Leave it to me", huh?
- Buddy, I didn't force you to come.

472
00:49:53,202 --> 00:49:55,204
<i>¡Apunten!</i>

473
00:50:03,587 --> 00:50:05,047
<i>¡Fuego!</i>

474
00:50:43,126 --> 00:50:46,004
Those are my friends from Tula.
I underestimated them.

475
00:50:46,171 --> 00:50:49,424
You see, some friends are
better than others.

476
00:50:49,591 --> 00:50:51,677
I wouldn't be so sure if I were you.

477
00:51:37,472 --> 00:51:41,143
Open the gate! Open the gate!

478
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:43,645
"¡Nombre de Dios!" The gate!

479
00:51:50,861 --> 00:51:53,113
Take care of that damn machine gun!

480
00:51:53,822 --> 00:51:56,033
How did you manage to get
all these people together?

481
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,495
I just told them Cacapoulos had
a lot of money hidden somewhere.

482
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:01,121
Look how they're guarding his life.

483
00:52:12,049 --> 00:52:14,593
Now drive the rebels out!

484
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:40,118
Through the gate, men!
Through the gate!

485
00:52:40,285 --> 00:52:43,705
Come on, men! Follow me!
Follow me!

486
00:52:44,456 --> 00:52:47,209
<i>¡ Viva la Revolución!</i>

487
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:07,521
Cover him!

488
00:53:08,814 --> 00:53:12,067
Cover him, "nombre de Dios",
cover hi...!

489
00:53:49,688 --> 00:53:52,191
Where the hell is he going?

490
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:23,180
All right, come on.

491
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,099
Jump!

492
00:54:37,736 --> 00:54:38,904
Wait, wait!

493
00:54:53,126 --> 00:54:56,421
Onward, "mis hombres", on!
