2
00:00:03,553 --> 00:00:06,882
DURANT: What brings the defender
of the saints to Laramie?

3
00:00:06,983 --> 00:00:07,892
EVA: What's this?

4
00:00:07,993 --> 00:00:09,536
JOSIE: I'm not stealing from you.

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,748
EVA: Don't mistake me for soft, Josie.

6
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:13,762
BRIGHAM: Salt Lake City's
to be the terminus.

7
00:00:13,863 --> 00:00:15,844
BRIGHAM: I have assurances
from both railroads.

8
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:17,849
HUNTINGTON: No luck finding
your wife and child?

9
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,817
PHINEAS: My father's
declared a work stoppage.

10
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,729
We are to report home to
Salt Lake immediately.

11
00:00:21,732 --> 00:00:23,640
SWEDE: Are you prepared for your ascension?

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,057
STROBRIDGE: President Ulysses S. Grant
has called a meeting in Salt Lake City...

13
00:00:27,143 --> 00:00:29,459
and you my friend are late.

14
00:00:31,226 --> 00:00:33,058
DURANT: <i>Gentlemen, if you please.</i>

15
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:34,313
COLLIS: <i>Wait, we are
getting absolutely nowhere.</i>

16
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:36,620
- DURANT: <i>May I repeat...</i>
- COLLIS: <i>You have made your point, sir.</i>

17
00:00:36,623 --> 00:00:37,893
DURANT: <i>For the record, this time.</i>

18
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:40,899
COLLIS: <i>For the record, we are going
round and round and round in circles.</i>

19
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:43,713
DURANT: <i>This meeting, I'm beginning
to think, has no shape at all.</i>

20
00:00:43,716 --> 00:00:45,285
COLLIS: <i>No. No shape,
nor a purpose. Neither.</i>

21
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,391
DUNT: May I suggest
we start from the beginning?

22
00:00:47,425 --> 00:00:50,386
No. Let's start at right now.

23
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:55,201
I want an answer, Mr. Durant.

24
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:57,977
Not an equivocation, not a redirect...

25
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:00,611
A simple answer to a simple question.

26
00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:05,566
Will the Union Pacific build north or south

27
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:07,367
of the Great Salt Lake?

28
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:11,212
The Union Pacific is planning to build

29
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:13,113
south to Salt Lake City.

30
00:01:13,148 --> 00:01:16,787
This great city in which we are gathered

31
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:21,698
is and has always been
our designated terminus.

32
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:24,100
Are you suggesting
Miss Ellison made this up?

33
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:28,613
I am stating that Miss Ellison
is a journalist, Mr. President.

34
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,149
She will write anything to sell newspapers.

35
00:01:31,384 --> 00:01:33,754
I thought her prose, uh, well founded,

36
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:36,563
articulated and... And
compelling, frankly, Mr. Durant.

37
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:40,100
Nobody is interested in your
literary criticism, Mr. Hunting...

38
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:42,171
Gentlemen. Per my contract

39
00:01:42,205 --> 00:01:44,644
with Collis Huntington and
the Central Pacific Railroad,

40
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:47,516
he had agreed to build south
through Salt Lake City.

41
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,452
Cassius?

42
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:53,528
Yet this map, which I am
recently come to possess,

43
00:01:53,562 --> 00:01:56,334
proves him to be both a liar and a thief.

44
00:01:58,472 --> 00:01:59,805
Mr. Huntington?

45
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:05,178
Well, Central Pacific Railroad
intends to build north.

46
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:10,186
Any, uh, misunderstanding on the part of
Mr. Young is regrettable and unintentional.

47
00:02:10,221 --> 00:02:11,787
- (SCOFFS)
- I motion

48
00:02:11,822 --> 00:02:15,462
that construction on
the Central Pacific's road

49
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:18,064
be suspended pending a full inquiry.

50
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:19,733
I would ask you, Mr. President,

51
00:02:20,136 --> 00:02:22,373
uh, to consider how

52
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,475
Brigham Young acquired that map,

53
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:26,946
private property of
the Central Pacific Railroad.

54
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,682
Uh, Samuel Ammerman, my...

55
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:31,122
My telegraph operator, disappeared ages...

56
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:35,895
Ages ago after being placed
there by Thomas Durant to spy...

57
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:38,668
That is an unsubstantiated accusation, sir!

58
00:02:38,702 --> 00:02:40,170
Private business of a private corporation!

59
00:02:40,204 --> 00:02:41,738
Have not corporations rights, sir?

60
00:02:41,773 --> 00:02:42,907
Now, surely, a...

61
00:02:42,942 --> 00:02:45,345
A penalty for corporate
espionage must be levied.

62
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:47,416
"Corporate espionage." You
practically invented the concept!

63
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:49,385
Thomas Durant is undermining
your railroad, Mr. President.

64
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,653
(YELLS) Enough!

65
00:02:58,837 --> 00:03:00,838
- Mr. Bohannon.
- Mr. President.

66
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:09,621
I promised the American people a railroad
that crosses this country, gentlemen.

67
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,659
It will be built.

68
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:14,061
If not by you, by someone else.

69
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:17,299
We will establish a route and a terminus,

70
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:20,105
a place where your two
railroads shall meet,

71
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:23,576
before any of us steps foot
outside Salt Lake City.

72
00:03:23,777 --> 00:03:25,177
One hour recess.

73
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,166

a meeting's about to start,

and you look down and you realize

suddenly you've been stripped
down to your unmentionables?

And you're... (SIGHS)

79
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,824
Never mind.

80
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:26,128
You're here now.

81
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:31,432
Uh, we have lost Brigham's trust

82
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:33,136
and his workers with it.

83
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:36,239
Regrettable but not irreparable.

84
00:04:37,674 --> 00:04:39,142
We're gonna strike back...

85
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:43,579
Hit Durant hard.

86
00:04:43,614 --> 00:04:47,185
Listen to me. There is no way
Durant gives up Ogden.

87
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,254
He's lying to Brigham Young

88
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:51,656
just to keep the Mormon workers
on his payroll long as possible.

89
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,157
We catch him in a lie,

90
00:04:53,191 --> 00:04:55,292
get Grant to give us Ogden

91
00:04:55,326 --> 00:04:57,361
and its millions of dollars' worth of coal

92
00:04:57,395 --> 00:05:00,195
as penalty for Durant wasting our time.

93
00:05:02,098 --> 00:05:03,299
Hmm?

94
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:04,869
I'll pick my spot.

95
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:10,040
Mr. Bohannon! (CHUCKLES)

96
00:05:11,008 --> 00:05:13,543
I'd heard Collis had
taken you under his wing.

97
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:17,513
I hope all this talk of
business and politics

98
00:05:17,548 --> 00:05:19,416
doesn't prove too much of a bore for you.

99
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:22,020
No. You always keep things interesting.

100
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,421
(LAUGHS)

101
00:05:24,188 --> 00:05:26,355
Well, I try to do my bit. (CHUCKLES)

102
00:05:27,091 --> 00:05:28,093
Well, I...

103
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,629
I, uh, hardly recognize you.

104
00:05:34,731 --> 00:05:36,398
BRIGHAM: We have Durant's support,

105
00:05:36,432 --> 00:05:39,464
but only as long as
his interests align with ours.

106
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:40,767
He needs our workers,

107
00:05:40,802 --> 00:05:44,237
but not as badly as I need his road.

108
00:05:49,842 --> 00:05:51,375
Father, I've returned.

109
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:52,943
Yes, four days late,

110
00:05:53,712 --> 00:05:55,180
and wearing unsightly boots.

111
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,520
Your brother and I are concerned
with pressing railroad matters.

112
00:05:58,554 --> 00:06:00,487
The railroad is also my concern.

113
00:06:01,686 --> 00:06:03,519
I pulled the men from Truckee
as you requested.

114
00:06:03,553 --> 00:06:05,888
I've done your bidding, Father,
and I have a small request.

115
00:06:07,824 --> 00:06:09,325
A quick one, I hope.

116
00:06:09,626 --> 00:06:11,092
The Hatchites.

117
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:13,262
The heretic sect,
I need to know where they are.

118
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,364
What you needed was an awareness

119
00:06:15,398 --> 00:06:17,168
of the treachery brewing
right under your nose

120
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:18,838
during your time on the Central Pacific!

121
00:06:18,872 --> 00:06:21,407
Brother Phineas is...
Is not at fault, O Lion.

122
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:23,808
It was the gentiles,
in particular, Cullen Bo...

123
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:25,741
Don't defend this imbecile!

124
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:27,976
I'm perfectly aware were it not for you

125
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:30,477
our mission there would've
proved twice as disastrous.

126
00:06:30,512 --> 00:06:32,347
You will not speak to me in this way!

127
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,126
Enough.

128
00:06:42,796 --> 00:06:44,429
Get out of my sight.

129
00:06:49,506 --> 00:06:50,773
Now!

130
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,550
Brother Phineas.

131
00:07:01,018 --> 00:07:04,022
No. Brother Phineas...

132
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,458
No. It...

133
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:08,662
Do you see how he treats me?

134
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,862
I do, it is deplorable. Hmm.

135
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:16,017
- Our men are well-trained.
- Yeah.

136
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,435
- Well-armed.
- Yes.

137
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:19,936
- We have prepared for this.
- We have.

138
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:22,105
We must strike now.

139
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:26,206
- Yeah, he has so many well-armed guards...
- Phineas!

140
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:28,443
And now the soldiers.

141
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:31,978
No, Zion is better protected
than when we left.

142
00:07:32,013 --> 00:07:33,547
Uh, now, we...

143
00:07:33,581 --> 00:07:35,717
We must be patient. Huh?

144
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:37,085
Phineas, wait.

145
00:07:37,687 --> 00:07:39,254
Ah! Hey, Cassius.

146
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:40,722
(CHUCKLES)

147
00:07:40,756 --> 00:07:42,057
Oh, look at you.

148
00:07:42,091 --> 00:07:44,095
The Hatchites are in the Red Valley,

149
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,694
southeast of Camp Douglas.

150
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:48,160
Couple hours ride from here.

151
00:07:49,463 --> 00:07:50,630
Thank you, Cassius.

152
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,699
Welcome home, brother.

153
00:07:58,368 --> 00:08:00,800
You see, yeah,

154
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:03,337
Heavenly Father continues to bestow upon us

155
00:08:03,371 --> 00:08:06,172
his unpected blessings.

156
00:08:06,206 --> 00:08:09,574
Uh, he will tell us when it is time.

157
00:08:10,443 --> 00:08:12,579
I grow tired of waiting, Brother Thor.

158
00:08:12,614 --> 00:08:14,947
Yeah, yeah. Uh, yeah. I see that.

159
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:17,417
I see that.

160
00:08:19,854 --> 00:08:20,954
(GRUNTING)

161
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:58,667
If only it was your own favors
I was paying for, Madam Eva.

162
00:08:58,702 --> 00:09:01,304
- Oh, we thank you for your patronage.
- (CHUCKLES)

163
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,373
Uh, Mr. Crigler.

164
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,608
Distracted by your charms,
I was. (CHUCKLES)

He takes me, right there on the stairs,

167
00:09:26,154 --> 00:09:27,720
but he said it didn't count,

168
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:29,356
"'Cause we wasn't in the sack."

169
00:09:29,391 --> 00:09:31,324
Dumb-ass cowboy!

00:09:38,334 --> 00:09:40,034
This box was full.

Seven hundred dollars.

00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:46,080
Our money.

173
00:09:48,382 --> 00:09:52,288
Now, whoever's doing this
is stealing from all of us.

(SCOFFS)

00:09:54,457 --> 00:09:56,991
Just say it, if you're accusing somebody.

176
00:09:57,985 --> 00:09:59,689
Oh, I'm looking at her.

177
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,468
- Josie would never...
- Quiet, Tess!

178
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:06,674
I'm real scared.

00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,711
(CHUCKLES) No, no, no.

180
00:10:10,146 --> 00:10:12,982
You're too stupid to be scared.

Highfalutin on account of your
pretty face and your fast hands.

182
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:22,585
Don't forget, little girl,

183
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:25,825
I found you in a pile of pig slop

184
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,762
gnawing on a chicken bone.

185

You cross me,

186
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:34,167
you'll be back there
quicker than you can come.

187
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,572
That money'd best turn up.

188
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:45,341
Eva ain't fit to be running things.

189
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:46,676
That's the truth of it.

190
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,243
It's what I been saying, Mick.

191

She don't protect us from
johns when they get rowdy,

192
00:10:50,346 --> 00:10:52,212
and now there's this money gone.

All she can do to fix it is blame us.

00:10:56,882 --> 00:10:58,317
You mean she blames you?

196
00:10:58,684 --> 00:11:01,385
She's just got it in for me 'cause
all the girls like me better.

197
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:03,788
They listen to Josie. I've seen it.

198
00:11:06,926 --> 00:11:08,526
And you think you could run the girls?

199
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:11,863
I could look out for 'em,
keep the cash safe.

200

Be happy to work alongside Johnny
here, you think that's best.

201
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,312
The route west and south
along the lake, Mr. President,

202
00:11:34,247 --> 00:11:36,515
it crosses open country for thirty miles.

203
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:39,819
It has advantages both as to cost

204
00:11:40,254 --> 00:11:41,986
and speed of progress.

205
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:45,356
As per federal law,

206
00:11:46,158 --> 00:11:48,894
we will acquire the land

207
00:11:49,729 --> 00:11:51,231
and mineral rights

208
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,570
twenty miles on either side
of the southern route,

209

Any questions, you may direct to the man

211
00:12:03,183 --> 00:12:05,053
who made the survey for the Union Pacific

212
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:08,491
while he was in my employ, Cullen Bohannon.

213
00:12:11,094 --> 00:12:12,562
I have some questions, Mr. President.

214
00:12:16,604 --> 00:12:19,573
This is the route the Union
Pacific plans to follow, exactly?

215
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:23,243
Uh, saving room for any
necessary detours, yes.

216
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,614
Detours?

217
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:31,182
Unforeseen departures from the thing

I know you're familiar with the term.

220
00:12:37,354 --> 00:12:39,286
I'm familiar with the route.
And having surveyed it myself,

221
00:12:39,321 --> 00:12:41,190
I assure you it requires no detours.

222
00:12:41,225 --> 00:12:43,724
(LAUGHS) Come, Bohannon.

223

Barring extenuating circumstances,

227
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:58,939
do you agree this route
requires no detours?

228
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:04,843
Barring extenuating circumstances.

229
00:13:04,877 --> 00:13:07,849
Let the record show Mr.
Durant's nod in the affirmative.

230
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,553
I propose that we take a vote to lock in
the southern route through Salt Lake City,

231
00:13:11,822 --> 00:13:14,790
and exclude any detours north,
including the coal fields

232
00:13:15,525 --> 00:13:16,960
around Ogden.

233
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:19,563
Well, uh, Central Pacific is ready
to lock in the southern route,

234
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:21,763
as proposed by the Union Pacific.

235
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:23,099
Wise decision.

236
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:25,436
What do you say, Mr. Durant?
Will you make it unanimous?

237
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:28,138
Excluding Ogden is premature.

238
00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:29,440
It's foolhardy.

239
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,277

(CLEARING THROAT) Mr. Durant,

241

Ogden is outside the straightest

242
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,484
Building to Ogden would constitute
a waste of federal funds.

go south and forfeit Ogden,

or go north through Ogden.

I want your choice made now.

You force my hand, um...

to go north, through Ogden.

that the Transcontinental Railroad

267
00:14:58,217 --> 00:15:01,155
will bypass your fine, fecund city.

268
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:04,725
I need you to put Salt Lake
City back on the table.

There, your... Your Zion resurrected!

The President's dream of
uniting this country by rail

flour from Mormon wheat,

Brigham, you and I both know

279
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,352
your Zion will die

00:15:39,386 --> 00:15:43,124
without the influx of cash
a contract with me provides.

281

Now, you have a choice.

282
00:15:46,762 --> 00:15:50,267
You can stomp your feet
like a petulant schoolgirl

283

or you can join me
in undoing Cullen Bohannon.

284
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,144
Salt Lake City is the terminus

285

or you can build your railroad alone.

Edge of Wyoming, and that
fatuous double-dealer,

290

he won't even make it far enough
west to smell the coal in Ogden.

291

We ain't even through the Sierras.

292

Durant will see through it, so will Grant.

293

Well, Grant's never been to the
Sierras, and Durant neither.

To build your railroad.

302
00:17:12,785 --> 00:17:16,790

that old soldier,

304
00:17:18,161 --> 00:17:20,665

you became a tycoon.

and all the other girls see it.

324
00:18:28,361 --> 00:18:30,261
She came to me after your job.

325
00:18:30,296 --> 00:18:31,596
(SCOFFS)

326
00:18:32,131 --> 00:18:34,031
She's a nasty piece of work.

327
00:18:34,465 --> 00:18:36,730
Running women is nasty business, sure.

328
00:18:37,163 --> 00:18:39,862
They need to be kept in line. And
you let them away with too much.

329
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,465
My cousin favors the change.

330
00:18:49,393 --> 00:18:51,462
We'd keep a place for you, of course.

331
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,500
Always room for a good whore.

332
00:18:57,235 --> 00:18:59,468
I'll get the money back.

333

Pray that you do.

334
00:19:03,274 --> 00:19:06,041
And get control of Josie and
the other girls, otherwise...

335
00:19:06,643 --> 00:19:07,842

00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:37,875

You know, it gives me no pleasure

341
00:19:51,587 --> 00:19:54,222
to find us set against
each other, Bohannon.

342
00:19:54,556 --> 00:19:56,527
I'm a little surprised, I will admit.

Given all your talk of "honor."

I joined the Central Pacific

The Union Pacific is your family.

346

It has been since the day you
bust into my rail car

347
00:20:07,204 --> 00:20:09,436
and told me to hire you
instead of hanging you.

348
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:18,847
You regret your decision?

349

Not if you come home.

00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:29,620
You don't owe that puny

He's using you.

He will ask you to misrepresent
the progress of the Central Pacific

Join me.

364
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:13,323
Together we can bury Huntington

You told me when I left that
you'd never take me back.

That day I busted into your train car,

you was gonna hang me for killing Johnson.

Going through Salt Lake City
ain't practical for the railroad.

he's willing to consider it.

I know he listens to you.

He's his own man.

At the end of the day,
he'll call it like he sees it.

Well, perhaps my route has

inquiring about the Hatchites.

Now, under my compass,

the Union Pacific has laid
987 miles of tracks

536

across four states,

work force, and supplies
as the Central Pacific.

539
00:33:29,193 --> 00:33:31,528
The Union Pacific would like to propose

540
00:33:31,562 --> 00:33:35,430
the naming of Promontory, Utah,

541
00:33:35,465 --> 00:33:40,999
385 miles west of Laramie, Wyoming,

542
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:43,235
as our terminus.

543
00:33:43,602 --> 00:33:45,202
At three miles a day,

544
00:33:45,236 --> 00:33:49,706
we will be there in less than
130 days from today.

Thank you, Mr. Durant. Mr. Huntington?

546

Mr. President, if it pleases
you, I'd like my partner, uh,

547
00:33:57,745 --> 00:33:59,445
to deliver our case.

548
00:34:08,356 --> 00:34:09,991
The Central Pacific will not be naming

549
00:34:10,025 --> 00:34:12,927
Fort Bridger as the final
terminus here today.

550
00:34:12,961 --> 00:34:15,764
Mr. Durant spoke true when he said

551
00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:18,401
such a proposal would be
outside our capabilities.

552
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:22,707
But he is mistaken

553
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:25,578
in naming Promontory as the
proper terminus of this road.

554
00:34:27,715 --> 00:34:31,049
Central Pacific wishes to propose
a more radical alternative,

555
00:34:31,084 --> 00:34:33,184
one which has been considered
but not fully discussed

556
00:34:33,218 --> 00:34:35,721
by the men in this room
over the last couple days.

We propose no terminus at all.

Mr. Bohannon, I...

559
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:43,860
But that both railroads follow
the agreed upon northern route,

560
00:34:43,894 --> 00:34:45,562
bypassing Salt Lake City,

561
00:34:45,596 --> 00:34:47,663

562
00:34:47,697 --> 00:34:49,163
with which each railroad builds.

565
00:34:53,902 --> 00:34:57,636
Mr. Bohannon, the purpose of this
meeting was to set a final terminus.

566
00:34:57,671 --> 00:34:59,038
Mr. President,

567
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:03,942
not long ago, I took a
train ride after a long war.

568
00:35:05,677 --> 00:35:08,344
And today, I sit here, in this room,

569
00:35:08,378 --> 00:35:10,879
a stake-holder in
the Central Pacific Railroad.

570
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,115
And make no mistake about it,

571
00:35:13,149 --> 00:35:15,650
the other men in this room are
driven by self-interest and greed.

00:35:15,685 --> 00:35:17,785
Greed for the coalfields in Ogden.

573
00:35:19,086 --> 00:35:20,619

with the best speech
or the most devious lie.

575

576

who gets there first.

You know, starting a race from
behind a granite wall

592
00:36:53,569 --> 00:36:56,036
is not going to make
for a very exciting finish.

593

I was hoping for more of a fight from you.

594

You've been an advocate of mine, Doc,

595
00:37:04,414 --> 00:37:06,685

you should've ended this race

it... Right here in this room.

00:41:32,926 --> 00:41:34,126
Father!

651
00:41:34,929 --> 00:41:36,932
It was Gundersen. He planned this!

652
00:41:37,434 --> 00:41:38,800
Thor Gundersen's the man you want!

653
00:41:40,768 --> 00:41:42,136
He's already gone.

654
00:41:43,807 --> 00:41:45,142
Find him.

655
00:41:46,277 --> 00:41:48,142
Find him, my son.

This morning Phineas
asked about a heretic sect,

657
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:57,116
their location...

658
00:42:09,096 --> 00:42:11,329
Come here. Come here.
